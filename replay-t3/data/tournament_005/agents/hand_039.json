            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have K\u2660 Q\u2660 in the BB - a very strong suited broadway hand\n- I'm out of position against one opponent (MiniMax-M2) who just called the BB\n- Pot is 10 chips (4 from me, 4 from MiniMax, 2 from SB)\n- I can check or raise\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nMiniMax-M2 has been very tight recently:\n- Hands 35-38: Folded preflop every time\n- Hand 33: Called 2 chips (minimum), then bet 6 on flop\n- Hand 32: Folded preflop\n- Hand 31: Raised to 8 preflop, then bet 14 on flop\n\nSo when they do enter a pot, they can be aggressive. The call from the CO (seat 4) suggests a medium strength hand - maybe suited connectors, small pairs, or broadway cards. They didn't raise, which is good for me.\n\n**Position and Stack:**\n- I'm out of position (BB) with 239 chips (59.8 BB)\n- MiniMax has 182 chips (45.5 BB)\n- We're relatively deep stacked\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nKQs is a premium hand, especially suited. It plays very well postflop with potential for:\n- Top pair good kicker\n- Flush draws\n- Straight draws\n- Nut flushes\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear check situation. Here's why:\n1. I'm out of position - checking keeps the pot small and allows me to see the flop cheaply\n2. KQs plays very well postflop - I want to see a flop with this hand\n3. MiniMax is tight and called rather than raised - they likely have a decent but not premium hand\n4. No need to bloat the pot preflop out of position\n5. If I raise, I might fold out weaker hands and only get action from hands that dominate me (AA, KK, QQ, AK)\n\nThe EV is higher by checking and seeing a flop with my suited connectors.",

I need to charge any draws and get value from worse hands like KJ, KT, or medium pairs that might call.\n\nA small value bet seems appropriate given the dry board texture.",

The blinds are 2/4, so I need to call 4 chips to see the flop. The minimum raise would be to 8 chips total.\n\nWith 9-8 offsuit from UTG, this is a very weak hand. In tournament poker, especially from early position, I should typically fold this hand. Let me think about position: I'm UTG, so I have 4 players to act after me. 9-8 offsuit has very little playability and is easily dominated.\n\nStack sizes: I have 52.2 BB, which is a healthy stack. The blinds are small relative to my stack, but that doesn't mean I should play weak hands from early position.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. However, with such a weak hand, pot odds aren't the main consideration - hand strength and position are more important.\n\nTournament considerations: I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots. Playing 9-8 offsuit from UTG is likely to get me into trouble.\n\nLet me check if there are any opponent tendencies I should consider, but with such a weak hand, I should probably just fold.

UTG is the worst position to play from, and 98 offsuit is not a good starting hand. My stack is 209 chips (52.2 BB), so I'm deep enough to be selective. The BB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 239 chips. Looking at the opponent history, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding preflop in recent hands, but that doesn't tell me much about their postflop play.\n\nPlaying 98o from UTG is generally a fold in most poker strategies. The hand has poor equity, is easily dominated, and being out of position makes it even worse. Even if I hit a pair, I could be up against higher pairs or better kickers. The only reason to play would be if I think I can outplay opponents postflop, but from UTG that's difficult.\n\nThe pot is only 6 chips, and I need to call 4 chips to see a flop. That's not terrible pot odds (1.5:1), but implied odds are poor because I'm out of position and the hand doesn't have great drawing potential. Even if I flop a straight draw, it's a gutshot with 98o.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and stack size, the correct play is to fold. I should preserve my chips for better spots. Let me also check if there are any other factors. The table has 5 players, so it's not a full table, but still, UTG with 98o is a clear fold.\n\nI'll respond with the JSON object.",

Opponent in BB (seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 239 chips, but they posted BB 4. MiniMax-M2 (seat4) is in UTG? Actually seat order: seat1 is Kimi, seat2 folded, seat3 folded, seat4 MiniMax, seat5 us. So positions: seat1 is SB? Wait SB is seat5, we posted 2. Seat1 is BB (big blind). Seat4 is presumably UTG? Actually with 5 players, order: seat1 is SB? No typical: seat1 is dealer button? Not given. But we have SB seat5, BB seat1. So seat4 is CO? Let's not worry.\n\nPreflop: we posted SB 2, BB posted 4, seat4 called 4 (so they called BB). So now it's our turn, amount to call is 2 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise total 8). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have 3c Ts, a weak hand. In SB vs BB and a caller, pot is 10 + 2 call? Actually pot currently: SB 2 + BB 4 + call 4 = 10. To call we need 2 more, making pot 12. Raise to 8 would be total 8 from us, which is extra 6 beyond call? Actually raise total 8 means we put 8 total, which is 6 more than call (2 to call + 6 raise). That would make pot 14? Let's compute: after raise to 8, pot = SB 2 + BB 4 + call 4 + raise 8 = 18? Wait we already posted 2, but raise to 8 means we add additional 6 (since we already have 2 in). So total contributions: SB 8, BB 4, other 4 = 16? Actually we contributed 8 total, but initial 2 counted, so add 6. So pot becomes 2+4+4+6 = 16. Yes.\n\nGiven hand is weak, likely fold. But we can consider potential to steal blinds? However there is a caller already (MiniMax) who called BB, so there is a live opponent in the pot. Raising with 3T is not advisable. So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: MiniMax raised preflop 8 in hand 31, maybe aggressive. But here they just called. So they might be willing to call raises. Our hand is not good.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

I need to call 5 more (since I already posted 1 as SB). The pot is currently 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise).\n\nMy hand: 9d 6h is a very weak hand - unsuited, low connectors. This is a trash hand from the small blind.\n\nPosition: I'm out of position for the entire hand, which is a huge disadvantage.\n\nStack sizes: I have 200 chips (100 BB), opponent has 196 chips. We're both deep stacked.\n\nOpponent tendencies: From the data, Kimi-K2 has raised once before (in hand #2) and folded 4 other times. Not enough data to determine if they're tight or loose, but they're not raising every hand.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 5 to win 9, which is about 1.8:1 odds (35.7% equity needed). My hand has nowhere near that equity against a typical raising range.\n\nTournament considerations: We're early in the tournament with deep stacks. No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands.\n\nGiven all this:\n- Terrible hand\n- Out of position\n- Facing a raise\n- Poor pot odds\n- Deep stacks make speculative hands less attractive (implied odds are decent but hand is too weak)\n\nThis is an easy fold. I should only play premium hands from the small blind when facing a raise, especially out of position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9d6h is a very weak hand out of position facing a raise.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me think through this decision carefully. I have Qh 4c in the Big Blind, facing a 6-chip raise from Kimi-K2. I need to call 4 more chips to see the flop.\n\nLooking at the situation:\n- I have Qh 4c - this is a very weak hand. Even if I pair the Queen, the 4 kicker makes it weak. It's also offsuit so no flush potential.\n- Kimi-K2's history shows they've been very tight preflop, folding 4 out of 5 times and only raising once. When they do raise, it's likely with a premium hand.\n- I'm getting 3.75:1 pot odds to call (calling 4 to win 15 total chips), which seems decent on paper.\n- But the hand quality is so poor that even with these odds, it's not worth playing.\n- I'm in the Big Blind, so I already have 2 chips invested, but that shouldn't cloud my judgment.\n\nThe main factors against calling:\n1. Very weak hand with limited potential\n2. Tight opponent who likely has a good hand\n3. Poor kicker makes even Queens potentially weak\n4. No flush or straight potential\n\nThe factors for calling:\n1. Decent pot odds\n2. Already have chips invested\n3. Position advantage post-flop\n\nBut the hand quality is just too poor to justify calling, even with the pot odds. This is exactly the type of spot where I need to fold and wait for a better opportunity.\n\nI should fold.",

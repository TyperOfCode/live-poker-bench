K4s is not a playable hand from UTG position, even with the suited connector potential. The risk of being dominated, the poor position, and the availability of better spots all point to folding.\n\nI don't need to search for more specific opponent information - the hand is weak enough that it's a clear fold regardless of opponent tendencies.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 2s4s, which is a very weak hand - 2-4 suited. However, I'm in late position (button) with only the blinds left to act. Looking at opponent tendencies:\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has mostly folded preflop (7 out of 10 times), but raised once in hand 31 and bet the flop. Shows some aggression occasionally.\n\nSeat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised twice preflop (hands 30 and 32), called once (hand 31), and folded several times. Shows more aggression than seat 4.\n\nMy stack is 193 chips (48.2 BB), which is healthy. The blinds are 2/4, so I need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\nWith 2-4 suited, this is a speculative hand that can make flushes and straights, but it's very weak preflop. Being on the button against only the blinds, this could be a good spot to steal or see a cheap flop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6 (pot is 6), so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds, which is decent. However, the hand is so weak that I'm likely dominated by any pair or better cards.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack (48 BB), so I don't need to take big risks. However, being on the button is a great position to apply pressure.\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies - both blinds have shown they can fold preflop (especially seat 4 who folds a lot), I could consider a raise to try to steal the blinds. But with 2-4 suited, that's risky because if called, I'm likely way behind.\n\nBetter to either fold or call for cheap. Folding is the safe play. Calling for 4 chips (2% of my stack) to see a flop in position isn't terrible, but the hand is so weak that even if I hit a pair, it's bottom pair.\n\nI think folding is the correct play here. Save my chips for better spots. Let me check if there are any other factors... I have position, but the hand is just too weak to play.\n\nActually, wait - I should consider that both opponents have shown some aggression, so they might defend their blinds more. Seat 5 raised last hand (hand 32) from the BB when it folded to him. So he might be defending.\n\nI'll fold.",

Current situation: Small blind already posted 2, big blind posted 4, and I need to call 2 more to see the flop\n5. All other players have folded\n\nFrom the opponent data I retrieved:\n- GPT-OSS-120B (the big blind) has been quite active recently\n- In the last 10 hands, they've folded 3 times, called once, and raised twice\n- Their last action was a raise to 12 chips in hand #32\n- This suggests they might be playing aggressively\n\nFrom my button position history:\n- I've played 32 hands total from button position\n- Win rate is quite low at 9.375% from button\n- Recent hands show I've been folding quite a bit from button\n- My last few button hands: Q4o (folded), 2dTs (folded), 76s (folded), 97s (folded)\n\nAnalysis of my hand Ts 9d:\n- This is a suited connector with decent playability\n- Can make straights and flushes\n- Has some straight potential (8-J-Q for straight, 7-8-J for straight)\n- Suited gives it flush potential\n- Not a premium hand but playable in position\n\nConsiderations:\n1. I'm getting good pot odds - only need to call 2 to win 6 already in pot\n2. I'm in position on the flop\n3. The big blind has shown some aggression recently\n4. All other players folded, so this is heads-up\n5. I have decent stack size to continue if I hit something\n\nGiven the situation:\n- Good pot odds (3:1)\n- Position advantage\n- Decent hand with playability\n\n\n- Opponent shows potential weakness after recent aggressive plays\n\nI'll leverage the favorable conditions to make a strategic call, capitalizing on the position and potential opponent vulnerability.",

The opponent in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been quite passive on flops based on my memory - mostly checking and folding with only 1 bet out of 10 previous flop actions.\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have top pair on a coordinated board\n2. I'm in position with the betting initiative \n3. The opponent tends to be passive and fold to pressure\n4. I want to build my stack in this tournament\n5. The pot is small (8 chips) so a bet has good risk/reward\n\nI should bet for value here. A continuation bet of about 6-8 chips seems appropriate to get value from weaker hands like smaller pairs, Ace-high, or draws while being prepared to fold if raised.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 6,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have top pair (Tens) on the flop in position against a passive opponent. A 6-chip bet targets value from weaker hands while building the pot with a decent made hand.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: Ts 9d (Ten of spades, Nine of diamonds)\n- Board: Ad 6s Th (Ace of diamonds, Six of spades, Ten of hearts)\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Stack: 184 chips (46 BB)\n- Pot: 8 chips\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe flop is Ad-6s-Th. This gives me:\n- Top pair: I have T9, and there's a Ten on the board, so I have top pair (Tens)\n- Ace on board means someone could have Ace kicker advantage\n- No flush draws visible\n- No obvious straight draws\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nSeat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is the only remaining opponent. From my recall of their actions:\n- They've been mostly passive on flops - mostly checking and folding\n- Only 1 bet out of 10 flop actions (a 12-chip bet in hand #25)\n- They seem to play straightforward poker\n\n**My Position:**\nI'm on the button, which is good position. The opponent checked, so I have initiative.\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\n- I have 184 chips (46 BB), which is a healthy stack\n- The opponent has 156 chips (39 BB)\n- Tournament play - need to balance survival with chip accumulation\n\n**Action Decision:**\nThe opponent checked, so I have the option to:\n1. Check behind (keep pot small)\n2. Bet for value (they might have weaker hands)\n3. Fold (but this seems too weak with top pair)\n\nGiven that:\n- I have top pair on a coordinated board\n- The opponent has been passive\n- I'm in position\n- The pot is small (8 chips)\n- I want to build my stack\n\nA bet makes sense here. Since the pot is 8 chips, a typical continuation bet would be around 4-8 chips. \n\nI'll go with a 6-chip bet to maintain pressure and extract value from the opponent's likely weak range.",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop with hand 6h 3d, board A\u2666 6s T\u2665 (actually Ad 6s Th). We have middle pair (six) with weak kicker (3). Board is Ace high with a Ten, possible straight draws: 9-8 gives open-ended? Actually board: A,6,T. Straight possibilities: 9-8 would need 7-8-9? Not yet. There's a gutshot: 9 would give 9-10-J-Q-K? No. So not many draws. Opponent MiniMax-M2 in BB vs SB? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2 in SB (post_sb 2). He bet 6 into pot 14 (so pot now 20). He is SB, likely stronger range. Our hand is weak. We could fold. Let's check opponent tendencies: we have recall showing he sometimes bets small (2), sometimes checks, sometimes bets 14 (large). This bet 6 is half pot. Might be continuation bet with A high, or maybe a made hand like Ace, Ten, or a pair of Aces? Board has Ace, Ten, 6. He could have A? Many combos. Our pair of six is low relative. Likely losing. Should fold.\n\nWe have legal actions fold, call, raise. Raising would be aggressive bluff, but our hand is weak and we are out of position (we are BB, he is SB, after flop we are out of position). Raising would be risky, we have 156 chips. Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise to 12 total). That would be 6 more (since call is 6). Not enough to push him out. Likely fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

This is typically a fold in most situations.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position. However, with 7c 3c, position doesn't help much with such a weak hand.\n\n**Stack**: 243 chips (60.8 BB) - Healthy stack, no need to take risks.\n\n**Current Action**:\n- SB posted 2\n- BB posted 4\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called 8\n\n**Pot**: 22 chips\n**To call**: 8 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis**:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has folded preflop in the last 10 hands consecutively! This is a very tight player. The fact that they're raising now suggests they have a strong hand.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): More active. They raised in hand 25 and 30, and showed down 8d 7s in hand 30. They seem to be a looser, more aggressive player.\n\n**Pot Odds**: 8 to win 22 = 2.75:1, which is about 36.4% equity needed to call. Even with position, 7c 3c has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. \n- My hand is extremely weak (7-3 offsuit)\n- There's been a raise from a very tight player (Seat 4 who has folded 10 straight hands)\n- There's also a caller (Seat 5)\n- I'm risking 8 chips (3.3% of my stack) with a hand that will rarely hit and is difficult to play postflop\n- Even on the button, this hand is not worth playing in a raised pot\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

I need to call 4 to win 22, giving me 5.5:1 pot odds.\n\nMy hand J9o is marginal, especially from the BB facing a raise and a call. However, I'm on the button, which gives me positional advantage postflop. With 5.5:1 odds, I can call with many hands. But I should consider opponent tendencies.\n\nFrom the data: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has no recorded raises in my limited data, but that's just small sample. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has called preflop multiple times with weak hands like 2s5s, 6c7d, 8d7s. So seat 5 is a loose caller. Seat 4's raise could be a wide range given seat 5 is loose.\n\nMy stack is 195 chips (48.8 BB). Calling 4 chips is only 2% of my stack. However, I'm out of position for the rest of the hand (actually wait: I'm on the button, but I'm in the BB this hand? Let me check: \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\" but \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 4\". So I'm the button but posting BB because button rotates. So I'm out of position for this hand (BB). That's worse.\n\nGiven I'm out of position with J9o, facing a raise and a call, I should probably fold. The pot odds are good but positional disadvantage is significant. Also J9o doesn't play well multi-way out of position. I could consider raising to isolate, but with a marginal hand and out of position, that's risky.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for better spots.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n1. **My Hand**: Qh Qc (pocket queens) - This is a very strong hand, but I'm UTG which makes it tricky.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (under the gun) - This is the worst position for a premium hand because:\n   - I have to act first with 4 players still to act behind me\n   - Any raise I make will likely get called by players behind me\n   - I have no information about what other players might do\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 178 chips (44.5 BB)\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking: 243 chips\n   - Kimi-K2: 216 chips\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2: 195 chips\n   - GPT-OSS-120B: 162 chips\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis from memory**:\n   - Kimi-K2 (seat 2): Has shown a mix of folding, calling, and raising preflop. Recent preflop actions include folds, calls, and raises to 8, 12. Seems to be playing relatively tight but will raise with hands.\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1): Has been mostly checking and folding preflop. Only one raise to 14 chips recently. Seems more passive/tight.\n\n5. **The situation**: \n   - I'm facing a call of 4 chips (the big blind)\n   - Minimum raise would be to 8 chips (2x the big blind)\n   - With queens UTG, I want to raise but I'm concerned about getting called by multiple players behind me\n\n6. **Considerations**:\n   - Pocket queens are strong but vulnerable to being dominated\n   - UTG with premium hands is actually a situation where you often want to raise to thin the field\n   - However, with 4 players left to act, there's a good chance multiple players will call\n   - If multiple players call, I'm likely to see a flop with queens which can be dangerous\n   \nI'll carefully evaluate my chip stack and tournament position. At 44.5 big blinds, I'm in a solid mid-stack position. The queens in my hand provide a strong starting point, but the under-the-gun position complicates my strategy. I need to balance aggression with caution, considering the potential for multiple opponents to enter the pot. The key is to make a decisive move that maximizes my chip potential while minimizing risks.\n\nRaising to 8 chips seems strategically sound. This approach accomplishes three critical objectives: establishing pot control, gathering information about opponents' hands, and potentially isolating a single player. The modest raise size maintains flexibility while signaling strength. I'm prepared to navigate potential multi-way scenarios, understanding that my queens can still hold significant value even if multiple players call.\n\nMy decision-making process weighs multiple factors: hand strength, position, stack dynamics, and the specific betting context. The preflop landscape suggests a nuanced approach that balances aggression with strategic patience.\n\nWhile folding feels overly conservative, calling risks creating an undesirable multi-way pot that dilutes my positional advantage. A targeted raise to 8 chips emerges as the most compelling strategy, enabling precise pot manipulation and information gathering.\n",

Wait blinds: SB 2, BB 4, then seat4 raise 8 means they raised to 8 total? Usually raise to 8 means total 8, which is 4 more than BB. So amount to call is 8 (so they raised to 8). Minimum raise to 12 (so raise at least to 12). We have legal actions: fold, call, raise. Need decide.\n\nOur hand: Ace-5 suited clubs. Not a premium hand, but suited ace can be played in late position, especially with deep stacks (40.5 BB). However, facing a raise from CO (cutoff) (actually seat4 is CO? Wait seat5 is us, seat4 is CO? The description says our position: CO (Seat5). So seat5 is CO, we are CO. Seat4 is MP? Actually seat numbers: seat1 UTG? Not sure. But we are CO, seat5. Action: seat4 raise 8. So a player in the button? Actually seat4 is likely the button? Let's assume seat4 is the player in the button (maybe MP). Regardless, they raised from earlier position (maybe MP). They raised to 8 (2 BB). That's a standard raise. Our hand is Ace-5 suited, we could call to see flop, but with 40 BB we could also raise (3-bet) for value or isolate. But Ace-5 suited is not strong enough for a 3-bet in early position? It could be a semi-bluff, but we are out of position after the button? Actually we are CO, after them (MP) raise, we are later position (CO). So we can 3-bet for value or steal. However, 3-betting with Ace-5 suited is risky, especially against a player who may 4-bet. But we have decent stack, but risk.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: we have no data. Could recall opponent raise patterns. The tool returned none (no raise actions recorded). So unknown.\n\nPot odds: calling 8 into pot 14 = 8/(14+8)=8/22\u224836% pot odds. Not relevant preflop.\n\nGiven we have Ace-5 suited, we can call and see flop. Stack depth 40 BB, calling 2 BB is fine. We can also consider raising to isolate, but risk.\n\nI think best to call.\n\nThus output JSON with action \"call\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

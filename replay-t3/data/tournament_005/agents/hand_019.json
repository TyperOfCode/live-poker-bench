The hand has poor equity, I'm out of position, and I have no information suggesting the opponents are weak enough to make this profitable. Even though the pot odds are decent (6:1), the reverse implied odds and positional disadvantage make this a losing play long-term.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

Now amount to call is 1 (to match BB's 2). Minimum raise to 4 (so raise to total 4). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength. Ks8 offsuit is a marginal hand in SB vs a single caller (likely MP). Position: after flop, we will be out of position (SB vs BB and MP). Stack: 179 chips (~90 BB) deep. So we can play a bit looser but still need to consider tournament stage? Not given stage but early.\n\nOpponent (seat 4, MiniMax-M2) appears to be very tight: many folds preflop, occasional calls, rarely raises. In the data, they called preflop with 2 chips (i.e., a limp) in hand 9 and 14. In hand 9 they bet on flop after limping (bet 2 into pot? Not sure). So they might be a passive player who limps and then bets small.\n\nThus, we could consider raising to isolate and take advantage of their passivity. However Ks8 offsuit is not a premium hand, but still decent for a raise from SB, especially against a limper. Raising to 4 (i.e., 2x big blind) is a standard raise. It could also be a squeeze if there were more callers, but only one caller.\n\nIf we raise, we risk being called and playing out of position with a weak hand. But we could also fold if we think it's not worth it. In early tournament, we can be selective.\n\nGiven opponent's tightness, raising could be good to take down the pot preflop or get heads-up with a slight edge? Actually we have K high, but opponent might have a range of decent hands (like A-x, K-Q, Q-J, etc). Ks8 offsuit is not great vs that range.\n\nWe could also just call the 1 chip and see flop out of position, but that is cheap and we can fold later. However calling a limp is generally suboptimal; raising isolates and can win the pot immediately.\n\nGiven the stack depth, raising to 4 is low risk. I'd raise to 4.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 4, reasoning: isolate a tight limper, take advantage of position, and avoid playing out of position with marginal hand.\n\n",

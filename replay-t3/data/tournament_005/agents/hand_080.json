            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 2s Td - This is a very weak hand (T2 offsuit). This is a fold in almost all situations.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - This is good position, but my hand is too weak to play.\n\n3. **My stack**: 127 chips (7.9 BB) - I'm in a critical situation with less than 8 big blinds. This is short-stack territory where I need to be selective about which hands I play.\n\n4. **Opponent action**: Seat 2 raised to 48 (3x the BB). Looking at the opponent history:\n   - They seem to raise frequently from SB position\n   - Recent raises: 48 in hands 74, 77, 78 (all preflop)\n   - They showed down some decent hands: TT, 66, AA, AQ, Q6\n   - They seem to be playing fairly aggressively\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 48 to win 64 (pot) + 48 (my call) = 112 chips. So 48/112 = ~43% equity needed. With T2 offsuit, I definitely don't have this equity against a raising range.\n\n6. **Tournament situation**: With only 7.9 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. T2 offsuit is not a hand I want to risk 38% of my stack on (48/127 = 38%).\n\n7. **Position advantage**: Even though I'm on the button, this hand is just too weak. I should wait for a better spot or at least a hand with some showdown value.\n\nThe only consideration is that with less than 10 BB, I could consider shoving as a steal if the opponent folds frequently. However, looking at their history, they raise quite often and have shown down decent hands. They don't seem to be folding much preflop.\n\nGiven:\n- Very weak hand (T2 offsuit)\n- Facing a raise (not just stealing blinds)\n- Short stack that needs preservation\n- Opponent shows aggression and doesn't fold often\n\nThis is a clear fold. I need to wait for a better hand or situation.",

Looking at hand #76, I was in BB and won without any action, suggesting the opponent folded. In hand #77 from SB, I raised with pocket Kings and won.\n\nWith KsTs, this is a premium hand in heads-up play. I should definitely play this hand. I have two options:\n\n1. **Call** - See the flop cheaply and play post-flop\n2. **Raise** - Apply pressure and try to win preflop or build a pot with my strong hand\n\nGiven that:\n- KsTs is a top 10% hand heads-up\n- I have position post-flop (acting second)\n- My opponent seems to fold frequently to aggression\n- 8 chips is very cheap to call, but raising can win the pot immediately\n\nI think a raise is the better play here to apply pressure and potentially win the pot without seeing a flop.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 48,\n  \"reasoning\": \"KsTs is a premium hand heads-up, raising to apply pressure and build pot with strong holding\"\n}\n```",

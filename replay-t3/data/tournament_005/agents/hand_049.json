They raised to 16 (2x the BB) which is a small raise. Given their tight nature, they're likely doing this with a wide range since everyone folded to them.\n\n**My hand**: T8s is actually a decent defending hand against a steal. I have position and a suited connector that can flop well.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, so 3:1 pot odds. This is good enough to call with a speculative hand.\n\n**Stack considerations**: Calling 8 chips is only 3% of my stack, so very low risk. If I raise, I'd be raising to at least 24 which is about 9% of my stack.\n\n**Decision**: I should call. I have position, decent pot odds, and a hand that can flop well. I don't want to raise because:\n1. I'm behind their raising range most of the time\n2. I want to see a flop in position with this speculative hand\n\n\n3. A raise would commit more chips unnecessarily\n\nI'll play this cautiously, using my position to gather more information on the flop. The small investment allows me to potentially outplay my opponent post-flop with a wide range of possibilities.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** Td 8d (Ten of diamonds, Eight of diamonds)\n**Position:** BTN (Button)\n**Stack:** 251 chips (31.4 BB)\n**Board:** 2h Jc Tc (Two of hearts, Jack of clubs, Ten of clubs)\n**Pot:** 32 chips\n**Opponent:** GPT-OSS-120B in SB with 116 chips\n\n**Preflop action:**\n- I posted BB (8 chips)\n- GPT-OSS-120B raised to 16 (from SB)\n- I called 8 more (total 16)\n\n**Flop action:**\n- GPT-OSS-120B checked\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (he checked)\n- I can check or raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have middle pair with Td 8d. The board is 2h Jc Tc.\n- I have a pair of tens (second pair)\n- There's a flush draw on board (2 clubs)\n- There's a straight draw possibility (Q-9, K-Q)\n- My kicker is weak (8)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw with the Td\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's actions:\n- They frequently fold preflop (hands 34, 36, 37, 39, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48)\n- When they do play, they often fold on the flop (hands 31, 33, 40)\n- They occasionally bet on flop (hand 35: bet 12 after calling preflop)\n- They raised preflop in hand 32\n- They called preflop in hands 35, 40, 41\n\nPattern: This opponent is relatively tight/passive. They fold a lot, especially postflop. When they check on the flop, they might be weak or giving up.\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check: Take a free card, see if I improve. Risk giving free card to opponent.\n2. Bet: Protect my hand, get value from worse hands, charge draws.\n\n**Considerations:**\n- I have a decent made hand (middle pair)\n- The board is somewhat coordinated (flush draw, straight possibilities)\n- My opponent checked, showing weakness\n- I have position (on the button)\n- Pot is 32 chips\n- Opponent has 100 chips behind (started with 116, put in 16 preflop)\n\nI think a bet here is good. I can:\n1. Protect against draws\n2. Get value from weaker hands\n3. Take down the pot now\n4. Build the pot if I'm ahead\n\nSizing: The pot is 32. A bet of 16-24 (50-75% pot) seems reasonable. Since the minimum raise is 8, and that's too small, I should bet more. Let me bet around 20-24.\n\nGiven the coordinated board and my vulnerable hand, I should bet for protection and value. I'll bet 24 (75% of pot) to charge draws and get value from weaker pairs.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The minimum raise is 8, which means I can bet as little as 8, but that's too small. I want to bet an amount that makes sense. Let me bet 20, which is about 62.5% of pot. This is a good size for protection.\n\nLooking at the legal actions again: \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this means the minimum TOTAL bet is 8, but I should bet more. Let me go with 20.",

Q5o has poor playability and is easily dominated.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (first to act after blinds) - Worst position at the table. I have to act first on every street, making it difficult to play speculative hands.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 197 chips (24.6 BB) - This is a medium stack. Not so short that I need to push with any two cards, but not deep enough to play speculative hands from early position.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, Seat 1): Has shown some aggression (raised to 24 from BB in hand #46 with 86o). Could defend wide in BB.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has folded to raises, called once from CO with 22.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Small blind, has folded frequently.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 24.6 BB, I should be looking for better spots. Q5o is a clear fold from UTG. Even if I limp, I'll be out of position against multiple opponents with a hand that rarely improves to anything strong.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Need to call 8 chips into 12 pot (20 total if I call). Getting 1.5:1 odds, but with such a weak hand and poor position, implied odds are terrible.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is an easy fold. Q5o from UTG is unplayable. Better to wait for a better spot in better position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q5o is too weak from UTG position. Poor playability, easily dominated, and terrible position make this unprofitable. Better to preserve stack for better spots.\"\n}",

            "reasoning_content": "We have hand #49, preflop BB with 7s Kc. Stack 128 (16 BB). Blinds 4/8, posted SB 4, BB posted 8. So we are out of position vs seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) who posted BB? Actually seat1 is BB? Wait seat1 posted bb 8. So seat1 is the other player (only other active). So it's heads-up (only two players). We are BB, seat1 is the button? Actually seat1 is after us? Let's see order: Seat5 (us) is BB, seat1 is SB? Wait the blind posting: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4 (so seat5 is SB). But earlier says our position BB seat5. In actions: Seat5 post_sb 4, Seat1 post_bb 8. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But the description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". That conflicts. The actions show seat5 posted SB, seat1 posted BB. Possibly the description mislabels. But we have to trust the actions: seat5 (us) posted SB 4, seat1 posted BB 8. So we are SB with 7s Kc, stack 128 (16BB). Amount to call is 4 (to call BB 8? Actually we posted SB 4, now need to call 8? Wait we already posted SB 4, the BB is 8, so to call we need to put additional 4 to match BB 8). Yes amount to call 4. Minimum raise to 16 (total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nSo we are SB with K7 offsuit (7s Kc). In heads-up, K7 suited? Actually 7s Kc is offsuit (spade 7, club K). In heads-up, K7 off is decent but not premium. Stack 16BB, we are shortish. Opponent seat1's tendencies: from recall, they have raised preflop once (hand 46 raise 24). Also they have bet on flop (hand 39 bet 8, hand44 bet 12). They have also check-call patterns. Overall they seem to be somewhat aggressive (raise 24 preflop). But not sure about range.\n\nWe need to decide: call, raise, or fold. With K7 off, in heads-up short stack, calling is okay to see flop cheap. Raising to 16 (total) would be 8 more after call? Actually raise to total 16 means we put 16 total, which is 8 more than call amount (since we already have 4 posted). That would be a raise of 8 (to 16). Minimum raise is 16 total, which is 8 over call? Wait call amount is 4 (to match BB 8). To raise to 16 total, we need to put total 16, which is 12 more than our current 4 (since we already posted 4). So raise amount = 12 (makes pot 4+8+12=24). That's a raise of 8 over call? Actually call would be 4 more to reach 8. So raise to 16 is +8 beyond call? Wait compute: we have 4 posted, opponent has 8 posted. To call, we need to add 4 (total 8). To raise to 16 total, we need to add 12 (total 16). So raise amount is 12, which is 8 over call. That seems okay.\n\nGiven stack 16BB, raising may isolate and maybe we can go all-in later. But K7 off is not strong enough to raise for value; but could be a steal? In heads-up, SB raising can be good but opponent is BB, likely to defend. Opponent's BB may be aggressive (raised preflop before). But we have no read that they raise often. Might be okay to call and see flop.\n\nPot odds: current pot 12 (SB+BB). If we call 4, pot becomes 16. Effective stack after call: opponent has 128-8=120, we have 124 left after call? Actually we have 128-8 (SB+call) = 120 left. So pot odds fine.\n\nGiven K7 off, I'd call.\n\nThus output JSON with action call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Actually seat 5 is BB, seat 1 is SB? Wait actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4, Seat1 post_bb 8. So seat5 is SB? But they said position BB seat5. Actually they posted SB 4, then seat1 posted BB 8. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are in SB with 7s Kc, stack 128, effective stack 128 (others have more). The amount to call is 4 (to match BB 8? Actually SB posted 4, BB posted 8, so we need to call 4 more to match BB). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total bet 16). So we can fold, call 4, or raise to at least 16.\n\nWe have 7\u2660 K\u2663. In SB vs BB heads-up, typical strategy: raise with a wide range, but with 16 BB stack, we could consider a raise to steal BB. 7K offsuit is decent, but not premium. However, we have 16 BB, and BB is Kimi-K2. We have some data: opponent's raise amounts vary; they sometimes raise 6,8,10,12,24. They seem to raise larger amounts sometimes. In this situation, we are SB, they are BB. They posted 8, we can raise to 16 (total). That would be a 12 raise (8+? Actually to 16 total). That's a 2x BB raise. Could be a standard raise.\n\nBut we need to consider stack depth: 16 BB, we could also shove. 7K offsuit is not a good all-in hand. So better to raise to 16 and see flop. But also consider that BB may re-raise all-in. With 7K off, not great against re-raise. But calling 4 is cheap, see flop cheap. However, if we call, we will be out of position after flop (SB vs BB, BB is in position). Actually after flop, action starts with SB first (since BB posted last). So SB acts first. So calling gives us position on flop? In heads-up, after flop, SB acts first (since they are \"under the gun\"). So we would be out of position (act first).

            "reasoning_content": "We have a flop with board 2h Jc Tc. Our hand: 7s Kc. So we have gutshot straight draw? Actually board: 2, J, T. We have K,7. So we have open-ended straight draw? The board: 10-J-? Actually we have 10, J, 2. With K we have overcards, but we have a gutshot? Straight possibilities: 9-8-? Not. To make a straight we need Q for JQK? Actually we have K, board J,T,2. To make straight we need Q and 9? No. Straight combos: 9-8-? Not. Let's enumerate: With K, need Q and 9? Actually K-J-10 forms K-J-10? That's not a straight. Need Q and 9 to make 9-10-J-Q-K. We have K, need Q and 9. No 9 on board. So we have gutshot to a straight (needs Q and 9). Also we have two overcards (K) and a gutshot.\n\nWe are in BB, stack 116, pot 52, opponent bet 20. Opponent is Kimi-K2 (seat1) with 231 chips, likely UTG? Actually seat1 is small blind? Wait position: seat1 is SB? The blinds: SB seat5? Actually they posted sb 4 (seat5), bb 8 (seat1). So seat1 is BB? Wait seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So seat5 is SB (we are BB? Actually description says Position: BB (Seat5). But they posted sb 4. Inconsistent. The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". But actions show seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So maybe the roles swapped: seat5 is SB but they call it BB. Anyway we are the small blind? Actually seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So seat5 is SB. But they say BB. We'll ignore.\n\nWe have 116 chips left after posting sb 4? Actually stack includes posted sb? Usually stack after posting is remaining. So we have 116 chips left (including sb posted? Usually stack after posting is net). So effective stack is 116.\n\nOpponent bet 20 into pot 52, so pot after bet = 72 (including bet). To call 20, pot odds: 20/(52+20)=20/72\u224827.8% needed to break even. Our hand equity: we have gutshot (2 outs? Actually need Q and 9. That's 2 outs each 4 suits = 8 outs. Also we have K which is top pair? No board doesn't have K. So we have 8 outs. Plus maybe we have backdoor flush draws? We have 7s, board has 2h, Jc, Tc. No spades on board, so we have 7s as one spade, could get flush draw if turn and river spades. That's 12 spades left? Actually spades: 13 total, 1 in our hand, none on board, so 12 spades left, but need two spades to complete flush, so probability lower. But main equity ~8 outs => ~18% on flop turn+river? Actually after turn, probability to hit by river ~ 15%? On flop, chance to hit by river = 1 - (44/47)*(43/46) \u2248 1 - 0.936*0.935 = 1 - 0.874 = 0.126. So ~12.6% for straight. Add flush possibilities maybe ~6%? So total maybe ~18-20% equity.\n\nPot odds 27.8% > equity, so call is negative expected value. However we could consider raise to bluff? Opponent bet 20, we could raise to 40 (minimum raise) to represent strong hand. But our stack is 116, we could raise to 40, opponent might fold? Opponent's tendencies unknown. We can recall opponent's flop betting patterns. We attempted recall but none found. So unknown.\n\nGiven we are short stack (14.5 BB). We may want to preserve chips. Our hand is weak. Better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

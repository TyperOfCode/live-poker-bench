That's 10/(18+10) = 10/28 = 35.7%. \n\n**Hand equity:** KJo against a typical raising range (say 15-20% of hands) has about 40-45% equity, which is better than the pot odds I'm getting.\n\n**Opponent info:** I should try to recall what I know about GPT-OSS-120B's raising patterns, but I don't have time to make a function call right now based on the error message. I need to make a decision.\n\n**Considerations:**\n- I'm out of position, which makes KJo harder to play\n- The opponent has a medium stack (38 BB)\n- I have a healthy stack and can afford to call\n- KJo is vulnerable to domination but has decent equity against a wide range\n\nGiven I have good pot odds and a decent hand, I should call.

The preflop raise to 12 was likely a strong hand (maybe 88+, AJ+).\n\n**Position & Stack considerations:**\n- I have 237 chips (59 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot is 28 chips\n- I can check and see a free card with my overcards\n\n**Decision:**\nChecking is the clear best option here because:\n1. I have no made hand, just overcards\n2. The board is relatively dry (no flush/straight draws for me)\n3. My opponent showed strength preflop\n4. I have position (I act after them on future streets)\n5. Getting a free card to hit my K or J is valuable\n6.

The board is Ts 7h 3c. I have:\n- No pair\n- No flush draw (one club)\n- No straight draw (need Q and 9, or A and Q - not possible)\n- Two overcards to the board (K and J)\n\n**Opponent info:**\n- GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively passive based on the recall data\n- They've folded preflop several times\n- When they do play, they tend to check-fold on flops\n- In hand 24, they did bet 8 on the river after checking flop and turn\n- They raised preflop to 12 in this hand, which is a strong action from them\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 40 chips, need to call 12\n- Getting 40:12 or about 3.33:1 odds\n- Need ~23% equity to break even on a call\n\n**Equity consideration:**\nWith KJ on T-7-3 rainbow board:\n- Against a pair of Tens: ~24% equity (6 outs - 3 Kings + 3 Jacks)\n- Against a pair of 7s or 3s: ~24% equity\n- Against two pair: ~13% equity\n- Against a set: ~7% equity\n- Against AK/AQ: ~28% equity (if they missed)\n\nThe roughly 24% equity against most made hands is close to the required 23% break-even point. However, this assumes we get to see both turn and river, which we might not if opponent bets again.\n\n**Position and future streets:**\n- I'm out of position, which is bad\n- If I call and miss the turn, I'll face another bet\n- Opponent has 140 chips left (35 BB), so they can apply pressure\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (59 BB)\n- Don't need to take marginal spots\n- Better spots will come\n\n**Opponent's range:**\nThey raised preflop from Seat 5, which is a middle position. They could have:\n- Pocket pairs (TT+ would be strong, but 22-99 also possible)\n- Broadways (AT+, KJ+, QJ+)\n- Some suited connectors\n\nGiven the board Ts 7h 3c and their flop bet of 12 into 40 (30% pot), they likely have:\n- A pair (T with good kicker, 77, 33)\n- Overpair (JJ+)\n- Possibly just continuation betting with air\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a marginal spot. I have 6 clean outs (3 Kings, 3 Jacks). The pot odds are barely sufficient, but:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. I have to dodge turn bets if I miss\n3. Opponent's preflop raise suggests strength\n4. I have a healthy stack and can wait for better spots\n\nI think folding is the best play here. The combination of being out of position, having a marginal hand with limited equity, and opponent showing strength preflop makes this a fold. I can preserve my chips for better spots where I have initiative or better equity.",

It's one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\nI have 199 chips (49.8 BB) which is a decent stack. The blinds are 2/4. I need to call 4 chips to see the flop from UTG.\n\nLet me think about the position: UTG is the worst position to play from, especially with a weak hand. There are 4 players left to act after me (MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB). \n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been playing fairly passively (checking/calling)\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised once in hand 22 but otherwise folded preflop\n\nMy own hand history shows I've been folding weak hands from early positions, which is correct.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6 chips (after my call, pot would be 10). That's 1:1.5 odds, or 40% pot odds. But with 3h 6d, my equity against random hands is terrible - probably around 25-30% at best.\n\nImplied odds: Even if I hit something like a pair of 6s or 3s, it's a weak pair that's vulnerable to overcards. I could hit two pair or trips, but those are long shots.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 49.8 BB, which is healthy. There's no need to gamble with such a weak hand from UTG. Better to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.\n\nGiven all this, the clear decision is to fold. Playing 3h 6d from UTG is -EV (negative expected value). I should wait for a better hand in better position.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors... No, the decision is clear. Fold.",

Seat2 (BB) Kimi-K2 has raise amounts 6,8,6,6,8. So generally small raises 3BB to 4BB. Both are relatively aggressive? Not sure.\n\nWe are on button with AQ offsuit. Good hand. In tournament with 41BB stack, can open raise. Typically open to 2.5-3 BB from BTN, maybe 8-10 chips. Minimum raise is 8 (2BB). That's small but okay. Could also raise larger to isolate. Since both opponents have decent stacks (SB 247 ~ 61BB, BB 200 ~ 50BB). We want to isolate SB perhaps. But also we could just call to see flop? Not ideal.\n\nGiven AQ is strong, we should raise. Choose raise to maybe 12 (3BB) or 14 (3.5BB). Minimum raise is 8, but we can raise higher. Need to consider legal actions: raise is allowed. Choose raise to 12 (total).

Flop: Kimi checked. We have A\u2666 Q\u2665, no pair, overcards to board (Ace and Queen). No flush draw (two hearts? board has 7h, we have Qh, so we have one heart, need two more for flush). No straight draw. So just overcards.\n\nOpponent likely has range: could be broadway combos, maybe T? He called preflop raise of 12 (3x BB). Likely a wide-ish range: suited connectors, small pairs, A-x, K-x, Q-x, J-x, maybe T? But we have top two overcards.\n\nWe have stack 152, opponent stack 237 (big). Pot 28. We could bet to protect and extract value from worse overcards (like KJ, KQ, etc) or from draws. But we also risk being raised by a stronger hand like TT, 77, 33, T7, etc. However board is low, and opponent checked, maybe they missed.\n\nWe need to decide legal actions: fold, check, raise. No bet option? Actually \"raise\" is the only betting action (since we can raise from check). Minimum raise is 8 (so bet at least 8). Pot 28, typical continuation bet size maybe 0.5-0.75 pot. 8 is about 0.28 pot (small). Could be good to bet 8-12.\n\nWe must consider tournament stage: 38 BB, moderate stack, want to accumulate but not risk big.\n\nGiven we have overcards and opponent checked, a small bet could be good to take down pot or get called by worse. If opponent raises, we can fold.\n\nThus raise to maybe 12 (total). That's about half pot. Reasoning: protect, get value.\n\nCheck is also possible to see turn cheap. But risk of giving free cards.\n\nThus I think raise to 12.\n\nCheck: maybe opponent could have T? They could have TT, would check? Possibly they'd bet.

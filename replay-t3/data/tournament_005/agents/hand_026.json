            "reasoning_content": "  Good, I have some information about the opponents:\n\n**Kimi-K2 (SB, Seat 2):**\n- Very tight player - mostly folding preflop (folded in 8 of last 10 hands)\n- Only raised once (hand #22) and checked once when they could\n- Not very aggressive\n\n**DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB, Seat 3):**\n- Also tight but slightly more active than SB\n- Folded 6 of last 10 hands preflop\n- Raised once (hand #23) and followed up with a flop bet\n- From hand #21, I can see they defended BB with As2d (a weak ace) and checked it down\n- Seems to play straightforward\n\n**My situation:**\n- Position: BTN (best position)\n- Cards: Ah Th (ace-ten suited) - This is a strong hand on the button\n- Stack: 237 chips (59.2 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot: 6 chips (1.5 BB)\n- Need to call 4 chips to see flop\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Ah Th is a very good hand, especially on the button. It's suited, has an ace, and good straight potential.\n2. **Position**: BTN is the best position - I act last on every street.\n3. **Opponents**: Both blinds are tight players who fold a lot. The SB folds ~80% of the time, BB folds ~60% of the time.\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 59 BB, I have a comfortable stack. I should be looking to accumulate chips against tight opponents.\n\nGiven that both opponents are tight and I'm on the button with a strong suited ace, I should raise here. A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 12 chips, but since there's already a SB posted, I should raise to about 3-3.5x total.\n\nMinimum raise is 8, but that's too small. I want to:\n1. Get value from my strong hand\n2. Apply pressure to tight opponents\n3. Build the pot when I have position and a good hand\n\nA raise to 12-16 chips seems appropriate. I'll go with 12 chips (3x BB) as a standard sizing that should be enough to pressure the tight blinds but not too large to risk too many chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With both players being tight, I could raise a bit larger to really put pressure on them. A raise to 14-16 chips would be good. I'll go with 14 chips to keep it reasonable but apply maximum pressure.\n\nWait, looking at the pattern again - both opponents fold a lot to raises. The BB did raise once and then bet the flop, showing they can be aggressive with strong hands. But overall, they're tight.\n\nWith Ah Th on the button, this is definitely a raising hand. I'll raise to 14 chips to:\n1. Build the pot with my strong hand\n2. Apply pressure to tight opponents\n3. Take control of the hand with position\n4. Potentially win the pot preflop (which is fine too)\n\n14 chips is about 3.5x BB, which is a solid standard raise size.",

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with Jh7s, facing a raise to 14 from UTG (Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking). The pot is 20 (4 from BB, 2 from SB, 14 from UTG), and I need to call 10 more.\n\nLet me think about this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Jh7s is a weak hand. Offsuit, not connected, not suited. This is a clear folding hand against a raise from UTG.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position (BB vs UTG), which makes playing this hand even worse.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the search results, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising preflop in various positions. In hand #16, they raised to 6 from UTG. In hand #12, they raised to 12. In hand #15, they raised to 30. So they have an aggressive raising range. Their current raise to 14 (3.5x BB) is a standard raise size.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 195 chips (48.8 BB). Calling 10 chips would be 5.1% of my stack. While not huge, I'm playing a weak hand out of position.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 20, need to call 10, so getting 2:1 odds. However, with such a weak hand, I need much better implied odds to continue, and I'm out of position.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (48.8 BB). No need to gamble with marginal hands.\n\n7. **Alternatives**: I could consider a 3-bet bluff, but Jh7s is too weak for that, especially against an UTG raise. Folding is the standard play.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been playing reasonably tight. In hand #16, I folded J9s from BB to a UTG raise of 6. Jh7s is even weaker than J9s.\n\nThe opponent has shown they can raise with various hands, but even against a wide range, Jh7s doesn't play well postflop, especially out of position.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold with a weak hand out of position against an UTG raise. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify playing such a poor hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Jh7s is too weak to defend from BB against UTG raise.

Hmm maybe they posted small blind because seat5 is SB? But they said Position: BB (Seat5). Yet action shows seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So my position is actually SB, not BB. But they state BB. Might be a mistake. Anyway I am in small blind with A6 suited. Effective stack 197, min raise to 4, amount to call 1 (big blind). So I can call 1 (i.e., complete to 2) or raise to 4+.\n\nA6c is a weak ace, suited, decent for stealing from BB? But I'm in SB with only one opponent left (BB). The BB is Kimi-K2 Thinking. No data on their tendencies. In early tournament with 200 chips each, stack sizes similar. I have 98.5 BB effective. I could raise to 4 (2x BB) as a standard raise from SB. A6 suited is marginal but can be used for steal. Might be okay to raise.\n\nConsider pot odds: If I call, I will see flop for 2+1=3 total pot? Actually pot currently 3 (SB 1 + BB 2). If I call 1, pot becomes 4. I'd be out of position post-flop.\n\nRaising to 4 would make pot 5 (my 4 + BB 2 + SB 1?). Actually we add raise of 4 total (i.e., 4 chips total from me). But we already posted 1, so raise additional 3? Usually raise_to is total amount you put in, but we need to follow spec: raise_to is total amount you're putting in (not additional). So raise_to 4 means my total contribution becomes 4, which is raise of 3 more. That would be 2x BB (2) plus 1 extra. That's a standard raise.\n\nGiven my hand, I think raising is okay to apply pressure. If opponent folds, I pick up 3 chips. If they call, we see flop with A6 suited.\n\nAlternatively could just call and see flop out of position. Better to raise.\n\nThus action: raise to 4. Reasoning: decent suited ace, want to steal, standard raise size.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed.\n\nReturn JSON."

Wait seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat5 is me BB, seat1 posted SB 1? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 posted SB 1? The actions: seat5 post_sb 1 (so seat5 is SB? Wait seat5 is my seat, but position says BB. Hmm maybe they posted small blind because seat5 is SB? But they said Position: BB (Seat5). Yet action shows seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So my position is actually SB, not BB. But they state BB. Might be a mistake. Anyway I am in small blind with A6 suited. Effective stack 197, min raise to 4, amount to call 1 (big blind). So I can call 1 (i.e., complete to 2) or raise to 4+.\n\nA6c is a weak ace, suited, decent for stealing from BB? But I'm in SB with only one opponent left (BB). The BB is Kimi-K2 Thinking. No data on their tendencies. In early tournament with 200 chips each, stack sizes similar. I have 98.5 BB effective. I could raise to 4 (2x BB) as a standard raise from SB. A6 suited is marginal but can be used for steal. Might be okay to raise.\n\nConsider pot odds: If I call, I will see flop for 2+1=3 total pot? Actually pot currently 3 (SB 1 + BB 2). If I call 1, pot becomes 4. I'd be out of position post-flop.\n\nRaising to 4 would make pot 5 (my 4 + BB 2 + SB 1?). Actually we add raise of 4 total (i.e., 4 chips total from me). But we already posted 1, so raise additional 3? Usually raise_to is total amount you put in, but we need to follow spec: raise_to is total amount you're putting in (not additional). So raise_to 4 means my total contribution becomes 4, which is raise of 3 more. That would be 2x BB (2) plus 1 extra. That's a standard raise.\n\nGiven my hand, I think raising is okay to apply pressure. If opponent folds, I pick up 3 chips. If they call, we see flop with A6 suited.\n\nAlternatively could just call and see flop out of position. Better to raise.\n\nThus action: raise to 4. Reasoning: decent suited ace, want to steal, standard raise size.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed.\n\nReturn JSON.",

So we are in SB, we posted 1, now amount to call is 1 (to match BB 2). Stack 197. Hand Q7 offsuit is weak. In early position (SB) after a call from BB, raising is possible but Q7 is not a good raise. Better to fold or call? In SB with Q7 offsuit, against a single opponent (BB) and a caller (MiniMax) already in pot, calling 1 cheap to see flop? But Q7 is weak, likely dominated. However you already have 1 in pot; calling 1 adds 2 more to pot (total pot 5+1+2? Actually pot currently 5 chips (blinds+SB+BB) = 1+2+2? Wait: SB 1, BB 2, plus call 2 from MiniMax = total 5. So amount to call 1 will make pot 6. Pot odds: 1 to win 6 => 16.7% required. Q7 offsuit maybe ~15% equity vs random? Might be okay but with two opponents, equity lower. Better fold.\n\nCheck if opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking is BB, but we have no raise history. Probably they raise with strong hands. So we can fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

In early position, typical strategy: fold or raise? In tournament with deep stacks (98 BB), UTG raise is common with strong hands like A-K, A-Q, A-J, K-Q, etc. A-T offsuit is borderline; many players fold UTG. But could also limp or call?

Preflop: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, we raised to 4 (so a raise to 4 total). Then Seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 12 (so a 3-bet). Then we called 8 (so we are now at 12 total). So pot after preflop: blinds 1+2=3, plus our raise 4 (additional 2 beyond BB?), actually we posted 2 then raised to 4 (so extra 2). Then 3-bet 12, we call 8. So total contributions: SB 1, BB 12 (2+4+6? Wait we posted 2, then raise to 4 (extra 2), then call 8 more = total 12). Seat1 contributed 12. So pot = 1+12+12 = 25? But given pot is 27 (maybe includes some other). Anyway.\n\nNow flop: 2c Kd 9h. Board: 2c, Kd, 9h. Our hand: Ace of diamonds, Ten of spades. So we have Ace high, Ten high. No pair, no draw. Opponent (Seat1) presumably has a range: 3-bet from BB after we raised. Could be strong: AK, AQ, AA, KK, maybe suited connectors, etc. But board is Kd, so they could have Kx (top pair). Our hand is weak. Stack sizes: we have 185 chips, opponent 176 chips. Pot 27. Opponent's action? Not given yet; we need to decide our action. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call is 0 (so it's our turn after opponent? Actually we are in BB, after preflop we called, flop is now. Likely opponent (Seat1) acted first (since they are in UTG? Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, probably under the gun? But position: seat1 is left of SB? Table order: seat1 is maybe UTG? But we are BB, so after flop, action starts with first active player left of button? Since button not given; but we are BB, seat1 is maybe UTG or maybe button? Not sure. But amount to call 0 indicates no bet yet. So we can check or raise. Considering our hand is weak, we likely check. Could also consider a bluff raise? But with only 92.5 BB stack, and opponent similar stack, maybe not advisable. Also opponent may have Kx. So best is check.\n\nThus action: check. Reasoning: weak hand, no draw, opponent likely has strong hand, we want to preserve stack.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Opponent could have Kx, 9x, A? Actually Ace is overcard; Ten could give straight draw? Board: 2-9-K, Ten not connecting. Straight possibilities: 8-7-6-5-4 etc not relevant. So we have only Ace high, maybe a gutshot? No. So likely losing. Opponent's bet size 16 is about 1/3 pot. Could be continuation bet from preflop raise 12 (they raised to 12 after our raise to 4). Preflop action: we raised to 4 (from BB), they 3-bet to 12, we called. So they are the aggressor preflop, likely have a range of strong hands: broadways, AK, AQ, AJ, KQ, maybe suited connectors, pairs. On flop K9-2, they bet 16 (c-bet). Our hand Ace Ten is weak. Should we fold? Yes, likely fold. However consider stack depth: 185 chips, we have 92.5 BB, not short. Fold is safe.\n\nCheck if any opponent tendencies: We have limited data. Use recall_opponent_actions for flop bets. Already attempted but no data. So we assume typical.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Amount to call: 1 (to match big blind? Actually we are in SB, we posted 1, need to call 1 more to match BB 2). So we can call 1 (making total 2) or raise min to 4 (total 4). Hand Kc8s is a weak hand, suited but low. In SB, against a BB and a limp caller, typical play is to fold unless you have good hand or want to steal. K8 offsuit? Actually Kc8s is suited, but still not great. Could consider raising to steal BB and maybe get folds, but there is a caller already (seat4). So raising might get called by BB and caller, risking chips. Better to fold. Also stack is deep (91 BB). So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

On flop, they might bet? But we have no info yet; we need to decide action: options are check or raise (fold not possible because amount to call 0). We could check, hoping to see turn cheap, or we could raise as a bluff. Need to consider stack sizes: we have 180 chips, opponent also 180. Pot is 5 chips. Minimum raise to 2 (so raise to 2?

Since amount to call is 0, raise to 2 means putting 2 chips total, which is a raise of 2 chips. That is a small raise.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, we might want to check and see if opponent bets. If they bet, we can decide to call maybe? But likely they have a decent hand like Kx, 5x, etc. Could we bluff? Small raise of 2 chips (pot 5) is 0.4 pot, could be a probe. But with pocket pair of 2s, low chance of improvement: need set on turn or river (two outs? Actually there are two 2s left). Probability of hitting set by river: about (2/47)*(1 - something). Not great.\n\nGiven tournament, preserve chips. So best is check.\n\nThus output JSON with action check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Straight draws: board 5-6, we have 2s,2c. No open-ended straight draws (need 4-7). Not present. So we have a weak pair, likely losing to any overpair (Kx, 5x, 6x) and also to any Ace, etc. Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 3 into pot 8 (so pot becomes 11). We have 180 chips left, stack large relative to pot. Should we fold? Likely yes. But consider opponent's tendencies: Past flop actions: check, fold, check. So they are not aggressive on flop generally. But this time they bet small 3 (about 0.5 BB). Could be a continuation bet with a wide range, maybe they have K, 5, 6, or a draw, or they could be bluffing. Our hand is very weak; we have no equity. The pot odds: need to call 3 to win 11 (pot before call) plus 3 = 14 total? Actually pot is 8, bet 3, so pot after call would be 11+3? Wait compute: pre-flop pot 8 (includes blinds and call). Flop: we check, opponent bets 3, so pot becomes 11 (8+3). To call, we put 3, making pot 14. So we get 3/14 = 21.4% required equity. Our equity with pocket deuces vs unknown range? Likely far lower than 21% because we are behind many combos. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand: SB with Ks8d. Stack 179 chips, blinds 1/2, pot 5. Action: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, MP (seat 4) called 2 (so they just called the BB). Now amount to call is 1 (to match BB's 2). Minimum raise to 4 (so raise to total 4). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength. Ks8 offsuit is a marginal hand in SB vs a single caller (likely MP). Position: after flop, we will be out of position (SB vs BB and MP). Stack: 179 chips (~90 BB) deep. So we can play a bit looser but still need to consider tournament stage? Not given stage but early.\n\nOpponent (seat 4, MiniMax-M2) appears to be very tight: many folds preflop, occasional calls, rarely raises. In the data, they called preflop with 2 chips (i.e., a limp) in hand 9 and 14. In hand 9 they bet on flop after limping (bet 2 into pot? Not sure). So they might be a passive player who limps and then bets small.\n\nThus, we could consider raising to isolate and take advantage of their passivity. However Ks8 offsuit is not a premium hand, but still decent for a raise from SB, especially against a limper. Raising to 4 (i.e., 2x big blind) is a standard raise. It could also be a squeeze if there were more callers, but only one caller.\n\nIf we raise, we risk being called and playing out of position with a weak hand. But we could also fold if we think it's not worth it. In early tournament, we can be selective.\n\nGiven opponent's tightness, raising could be good to take down the pot preflop or get heads-up with a slight edge? Actually we have K high, but opponent might have a range of decent hands (like A-x, K-Q, Q-J, etc). Ks8 offsuit is not great vs that range.\n\nWe could also just call the 1 chip and see flop out of position, but that is cheap and we can fold later. However calling a limp is generally suboptimal; raising isolates and can win the pot immediately.\n\nGiven the stack depth, raising to 4 is low risk. I'd raise to 4.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 4, reasoning: isolate a tight limper, take advantage of position, and avoid playing out of position with marginal hand.\n\n",

However with 46 BB, you could open with a wide range; JhTc is borderline. Many players open from UTG with JTs suited; offsuit is weaker. I'd lean to fold.

Seats 1 and 2 folded. Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised to 8 (so raise of 4 more? Actually they raised 8 total, meaning they put 8 chips, which is 2x big blind). So they raised 8, meaning they raised 4 over the BB? Wait: BB posted 4, raise to 8 means they put in 8 total, i.e., they raised 4 more. Minimum raise to 12 (so raise must be to at least 12). Amount to call is 4 (to match 8). So we can fold, call 4 (making pot 12), or raise to at least 12 total (i.e., add 8 more). Our hand K T offsuit in BB vs a raise from UTG? Actually seat3 is maybe MP? We don't know position but seat3 is after seat2 (who folded). So seat3 is in early position? Seats: seat1 is UTG? Not sure. But we are BB, so we are out of position post-flop. K T offsuit is a decent hand but not premium. In a 45 BB stack, calling 4 (1 BB) is cheap. We could call and see flop. Opponent raised only to 8 (2x BB), which is small. Could be a wide raise. So calling is fine. Raising could be possible to isolate, but we have only moderate hand. Raising to 12 would be 8 more chips (2 BB). Might be okay if we want to take initiative. However K T offsuit is not great for 3-bet. Better to call and see flop.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: We only have one raise record: hand 15 raise 8. Not enough info. Could be a standard raise size. Likely they have a wide range.\n\nThus best action: call. Provide reasoning.",

Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised to 8 (so 4 raise? Actually raise to 8 total). Then we called 4 to match 8? Wait preflop: seat3 raise 8, seat4 fold, seat5 call 4 (so we called the raise, putting 4 more to total 8). So pot after preflop: blinds 2+4=6, plus raise 8 from seat3 and call 4 from us? Actually seat3 raised to 8 (so he put 8 total). We called 4 more, making our total 8 as well. So pot = 2+4+8+8 = 22? But given pot 18 chips on flop. Maybe they count only contributions after flop? Let's trust pot 18.\n\nBoard: 2c 7s 3d. So we have Kh Ts, no pair, no straight draw (we have gutshot? 2-3-4-5-6? Actually we have Ten and King, not relevant). So we have just high cards. Opponent seat3 likely has range of raise preflop: could be many hands, maybe 8-9% from UTG? Not sure position: seat3 is after SB? Seats: seat1 is UTG? Actually seat order: seat1 is maybe UTG? But we are BB, seat5. So seat3 is likely MP? Anyway they raised preflop, we called. On flop 2-7-3 low rainbow. No obvious draws. Our hand is weak. We have no pair, no draw. So best is to check (fold is not needed because amount to call is 0). So we can check. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We could consider raising as bluff, but stack 176, pot 18. Opponent may have missed flop, we could attempt a c-bet? But we are out of position (BB vs raise preflop). Actually we are in position? On flop, action starts with first active player left of button? Since we are BB, after flop the first to act is seat1? But seat1 folded preflop. Seat2 folded. So seat3 (DeepSeek) is first to act. But we are given \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning it's our turn and no bet yet. So opponent hasn't acted yet on flop. So we can check, and then opponent will act. If we check, we give them chance to bet. If they bet, we can decide. Could also raise as a semi-bluff but we have no draws. Likely not good.\n\nThus we should check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Evaluate opponent's betting pattern: On flop, bet 8 (small bet, ~1/3 pot). Could be continuation bet (c-bet) from raise preflop (he raised to 8 preflop). He is likely representing a range of strong hands and draws. Our hand has no equity, just high cards. We have 0 outs to improve to pair (K or T not on board). So calling would be a lose expectation. Pot odds: need to call 8 to win 34 (pot after bet?), actually pot currently 26, opponent bet 8 makes pot 34, we call 8 to win 34, pot odds 8/34 = 23.5% needed. Our equity is near 0% (maybe some chance to hit a straight on turn? Ten could make straight with 9-8-6? Actually board 2-7-3, to make straight we need 4-5-6-8-9 etc. Ten not relevant.

In this hand they posted big blind only; they haven't acted yet. So we have option to raise to 8 minimum (so raise 4 more). With 6c7d, a raise from SB is possible as a steal attempt. But the BB is likely to defend with a wide range. Our stack is 174, we could raise to 8 (2BB) which is small. Might be okay to just call and see flop cheap.

We have 6-7 gives a gutshot to 4 for straight 4-5-6-7-8? Wait need 4 and 8? Let's analyze: board 5,5,3. Our hand 6,7. Possible combos: we have a gutshot straight draw to a 4 (4-5-6-7-8) missing 4 and 8. Actually need both 4 and 8? Straight 4-5-6-7-8: we have 6,7, board 5,5,3. Need 4 and 8. So not a draw. We have a pair? No. We have a backdoor flush? Suits: board hearts hearts diamonds. Our suits: 6c (clubs), 7d (diamonds). So we have one diamond (7d) plus board has diamond 5d, so we have a flush draw? Need 2 more diamonds, not possible. So we have basically just high card 7, maybe a gutshot? Not strong.\n\nOpponent Kimi-K2 is in seat 1, they are SB? Actually seat 1 is SB? Wait blinds: seat5 BB, seat1 SB? Actually preflop: seat5 post_sb 2 (so seat5 is SB) and seat1 post_bb 4 (so seat1 is BB). So we are SB with 2 chips, they are BB with 4. They checked preflop. Now flop: amount to call 0, they have checked? Actually we have legal actions: fold, check, raise. So they haven't acted yet? The flop action order: SB first? Usually SB acts first preflop, but post-flop, the first active player left of button. Button is seat? Not given. Since only two players left (SB and BB). The SB is seat5, BB seat1. The SB acts first on flop. So we have option to bet/raise or check. Opponent's flop behavior? We can recall their past flop checks. We saw they checked flop twice before.\n\nGiven our weak hand, we likely want to check and see a cheap turn. Raising might be a bluff but risk. Our stack 172, pot 8. Minimum raise to 4 means raise to 4 total? Actually raise to total amount of 4 (i.e., bet 4). That would be 4 into pot 8, pot becomes 12. Not huge. Could be a small bet to try to take pot. But we have no equity, but could be a bluff. Opponent may call with weak. But they have been checking. Might be passive.\n\nGiven tournament, preserve chips. So check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Board: 5d 5h 3h 7s. Our hand: 6c 7d. We have pair of sevens (7s on board, we have 7d) so we have top pair? Actually board has a 7 on board, we have 7d, so we have a pair of sevens (one on board, one in hand). Also we have a straight draw? Let's see: board: 5-5-3-7. Our 6 gives us a gutshot? 5-6-7 is a straight draw needing 4 or 8. We have 6c, board has 5,5,7, so need 4 or 8 for straight. Not strong. Also possible flush? Board has hearts: 5h,3h. We have no hearts. So no flush draw.\n\nWe have middle pair (7s) but board also has pair of fives, so two pair possible for opponent. Opponent (Seat 1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 233 chips, still a big stack. No bets yet, both checked flop. Turn is now? The actions list: preflop, flop both checked. So it's turn, and it's our action? Actually seat 5 is us, seat 1 is opponent. The order: BB is seat 5, SB seat1. Preflop: seat5 posted small blind? Actually blind structure: SB 2, BB 4. But seat5 is BB, posted 4? The logs show seat5 post_sb 2 and seat1 post_bb 4. That suggests seat5 is SB? Wait they said Position: BB (Seat5). But logs: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 2 (small blind). Seat1 post_bb 4 (big blind). So seat5 is SB actually, but they said BB? Might be reversed. Regardless, after preflop, seat5 called 2 (to match BB 4?), Actually they call 2? The BB is 4, they call 2? This is weird. Anyway, they are in the small blind maybe.\n\nNow turn: after flop checks, it's our turn? Usually action proceeds from SB first? On flop, after preflop, SB acts first. They both checked, so after flop, the first to act is SB (seat5). So it's our turn on turn. Amount to call: 0, min raise 4. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe have a pair of sevens, but board pair of fives. Opponent could have a higher pair like 5x, or maybe a set of 5s? But there are two 5s on board, set would be 5x in hand (full house). Opponent could have 5x (full house), or 7x for trips (but board only one 7, need another 7 in hand for trips). We have one 7, so we have trips? Wait board has 7s (7s). Actually board shows 7s (spade). So there is a single 7 on board. With our 7d, we have a pair of sevens (pair). Not trips. Opponent could have 7x for trips (two 7s). But they would need another 7, only one left (clubs). So they could have 7c, giving them trips. That's possible.\n\nAlso opponent could have a straight draw, like 4-8 combos.\n\nWe have 172 chips, opponent 233. Small stack relative to blinds 2/4, we have 43 BB, decent.\n\nGiven we have weak hand, likely check and see river.\n\nBut maybe consider raising to steal pot? The pot is 8 chips, small. Raising to 8 (min raise 4) would be a small raise. Opponent could call with any pair or draw. Might not be good.\n\nThus best is check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. No call because amount to call 0.\n\nWe choose check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Flop: Kimi checked. We have A\u2666 Q\u2665, no pair, overcards to board (Ace and Queen). No flush draw (two hearts? board has 7h, we have Qh, so we have one heart, need two more for flush). No straight draw. So just overcards.\n\nOpponent likely has range: could be broadway combos, maybe T? He called preflop raise of 12 (3x BB). Likely a wide-ish range: suited connectors, small pairs, A-x, K-x, Q-x, J-x, maybe T? But we have top two overcards.\n\nWe have stack 152, opponent stack 237 (big). Pot 28. We could bet to protect and extract value from worse overcards (like KJ, KQ, etc) or from draws. But we also risk being raised by a stronger hand like TT, 77, 33, T7, etc. However board is low, and opponent checked, maybe they missed.\n\nWe need to decide legal actions: fold, check, raise. No bet option? Actually \"raise\" is the only betting action (since we can raise from check). Minimum raise is 8 (so bet at least 8). Pot 28, typical continuation bet size maybe 0.5-0.75 pot. 8 is about 0.28 pot (small). Could be good to bet 8-12.\n\nWe must consider tournament stage: 38 BB, moderate stack, want to accumulate but not risk big.\n\nGiven we have overcards and opponent checked, a small bet could be good to take down pot or get called by worse. If opponent raises, we can fold.\n\nThus raise to maybe 12 (total). That's about half pot. Reasoning: protect, get value.\n\nCheck is also possible to see turn cheap. But risk of giving free cards.\n\nThus I think raise to 12.\n\nCheck: maybe opponent could have T? They could have TT, would check? Possibly they'd bet.

Actually actions: seat1 posted sb 2, seat2 posted bb 4, seats 3 and 4 folded. So it's just us on button with amount to call 4 (big blind). No raise yet. So we can call 4 or raise (min raise to 8). Hand 8-7 offsuit (unsuited). In BTN, can be a decent speculative hand, but stack is 43 BB, not short. Should we raise? Consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (seat1 SB) and Kimi-K2 (seat2 BB). Actually seat1 is SB, seat2 BB. Both same name? Might be same player with two seats? Probably two different opponents with same name? Could be two separate players: seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 is Kimi-K2. Both likely similar style. We have recall of opponent raise patterns preflop: they raise to 6,6,8,6,6,8,12. So they sometimes raise small (3BB) or larger (3BB to 12). No data on calling or folding. In this hand, they have already posted blinds, not raised. So we are facing no raise, just the blinds. So we can just call (i.e., limp) or raise. With 8-7 offsuit, typical BTN open raise is fine, especially with 43 BB. Raise to maybe 12-15 (3-4 BB) to steal blinds. But we need to consider the SB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) may be tight? Not known. But typical tournament strategy: open raise with suited connectors, but 8-7 off is marginal. However being on button, you can raise to apply pressure. The BB (Kimi-K2) may defend. But also we could just call to see flop cheap and try to hit straight. However calling 4 into a 6 pot gives us 2:1 pot odds, but we have no equity preflop. Might be okay to limp? In modern NLHE, limping is rarely optimal. Better to raise for value or fold. Hand is not strong enough to call a raise later if someone 3-bets. So perhaps raise to 12 (3 BB) to isolate and potentially win blind.\n\nStack is deep enough for post-flop play. 8-7 off can make straights, but not suited, so limited flush potential. I'd raise to 12 (total). Reasoning: attempt to steal blinds, button advantage, hand decent enough for a raise.\n\nCheck legality: raise_to must be total amount. Minimum raise is 8, we can raise to 12. So action: raise, raise_to 12.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually board has Ace and King, they might have A? If they have A? They could have A? but they'd likely bet?

So currently we have high card 8, 7.\n\nOpponent (Seat2) checked. Pot 26. We have stack 162, min raise 8.\n\nWe need to decide action: check or raise. Consider opponent tendencies: we have no data (recall returned none). Could check to see if they bet later. But we have a draw, maybe we can semi-bluff raise. However stack is decent, 40 BB. We are in position, can take initiative.\n\nWhat about equity: we have about 8 outs, about 16% to hit on turn, plus maybe river if miss? Actually after turn if miss, still could get river. Approx 8 outs *2 = 16% turn, 30% by river. Not huge but decent. Semi-bluff could win pot now.\n\nBut opponent just checked. Could be weak hand, maybe they have Ace king? Actually board has Ace and King, they might have A? If they have A? They could have A? but they'd likely bet? Not sure.\n\nGiven limited info, maybe check to see if they bet later; if we raise now, we risk being called by a made hand (AK, AA, KK) and we lose chips.\n\nThus checking is safer.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call 0, so we can check.\n\nThus answer: check.\n\n",

Wait board: 5h Kc As Tc. That's 5, K, A, T. No J. So we have 7-8, need 9 for straight (7-8-9-10-J?) Actually need 9 and J? Let's think: Straight possibilities with 8-7: we could have 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 6 and 9) or 7-8-9-10-J (needs 9 and J). Board has 10 but no 9, J, 6. So no immediate draw. We have two overcards to board (8 and 7 are lower than K, A, T). No pair, no flush draw (board has hearts, clubs, spades, clubs). Our suits: 8d,7s. No flush draw. So we have nothing.\n\nOpponent (Seat 2) has checked twice (flop and turn). That suggests weak hand or draw. Our stack is 162, pot 26. Turn is after opponent checked. We are on button, we have nothing. Options: check (to see river for free) or bet (raise). Since opponent checked, they likely have weak hand, maybe missed draws. We could try a bluff. However, our stack is 162, pot 26, min raise is 8. Raising to 8 (total) is a small bet. Could be effective as a \"probe\" but likely they will call with any pair (K, A, T). They have Kc? Unknown.\n\nConsider tournament: we have 40.5 BB, not huge but okay. Should we try to steal the pot? The board is fairly high: Ace, King, Ten. Opponent likely has a strong hand if they have Ace or King. But they checked, maybe they have middle pair (T) or a draw. We have nothing, so a small raise may get called and we lose more chips. Better to check and see river. Since amount to call is 0, checking is safe.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nWe need to output JSON.",

Our hand: 8-7, no pair, no straight draw (board has A K T 5 5). Our best hand is high card Ace? Actually we have 8 and 7, board Ace high, we have Ace on board, we have no pair. So we have Ace high (board Ace). Opponent (Seat 2) checked river. So they have checked. We can check or raise. What is opponent's range? Seat 2 is BB, called preflop raise of 12 (our raise). So they called 8 (since raise to 12, they called 8). So they have a hand that can call a raise of 12 preflop from BB. Likely decent hands: any pair, broadways, suited connectors maybe. Board is fairly high; they could have made pair of 5s, a straight? Board: A K T 5 5. Straight possibilities: 9-8 would give 9-8-7-6-5? Not present. Actually board includes T, K, A, 5,5. Straight combos: 9-8-7-6-5 (needs 9,8,7,6). Not possible. 8-7-6-5-4 (needs 8,7,6,4). Not possible. So no straight on board.\n\nPotential opponent's hand: maybe they have a pair (e.g., A, K, T, 5, etc). Could have Ace, King, Ten, pair of 5s (if they have a 5). Could have a set of 5s if they have 5x. Could have two pair (A K, A T, K T, etc). Could have top pair Ace with kicker etc. Could have a missed draw.\n\nGiven we have no showdown value, we are behind most of opponent's range. So checking is best. Raising is a bluff attempt; but we have no equity and board is not very dynamic. River check is fine.\n\nCheck is legal (amount to call 0). So action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Wait blinds: SB 2, BB 4, then seat4 raise 8 means they raised to 8 total? Usually raise to 8 means total 8, which is 4 more than BB. So amount to call is 8 (so they raised to 8).

Not a premium hand, but suited ace can be played in late position, especially with deep stacks (40.5 BB). However, facing a raise from CO (cutoff) (actually seat4 is CO? Wait seat5 is us, seat4 is CO? The description says our position: CO (Seat5). So seat5 is CO, we are CO. Seat4 is MP? Actually seat numbers: seat1 UTG? Not sure. But we are CO, seat5. Action: seat4 raise 8. So a player in the button? Actually seat4 is likely the button? Let's assume seat4 is the player in the button (maybe MP). Regardless, they raised from earlier position (maybe MP). They raised to 8 (2 BB). That's a standard raise. Our hand is Ace-5 suited, we could call to see flop, but with 40 BB we could also raise (3-bet) for value or isolate. But Ace-5 suited is not strong enough for a 3-bet in early position? It could be a semi-bluff, but we are out of position after the button? Actually we are CO, after them (MP) raise, we are later position (CO). So we can 3-bet for value or steal. However, 3-betting with Ace-5 suited is risky, especially against a player who may 4-bet. But we have decent stack, but risk.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: we have no data.

Need to consider opponent tendencies: we have data on Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raising preflop amounts: 8,6,6,8,12. Those are raises from SB? Actually seat 2 is Kimi-K2. In this hand, seat 3 posted SB 2 (so seat 3 is SB), seat 4 posted BB 4 (BB). So seat 2 is not in blinds; seat 2 is left of SB? Actually seat numbers: seat 1,2,3,4,5. Seat 5 is us UTG (but UTG is seat 5? Usually UTG is left of big blind; but seat numbers may be arbitrary). Anyway, we have opponents: Kimi-K2 seats 1 and 2. Both have stacks > our stack. We have no info on their tendencies besides raise amounts. They seem to raise small amounts (6-12). Likely they are playing standard raise sizes.\n\nWe are UTG, first to act preflop after blinds posted. Amount to call is 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to total 8). So we can raise to 8 (a 4x raise? Actually big blind 4, raise to 8 is 4 more). That's a standard raise size of 2 BB (since BB is 4). That's small but typical in tournament early stage.\n\nGiven JJ, we should raise to build pot and isolate. Might consider re-raise (3-bet) if we anticipate a raise from later players? But currently no raise yet; we are first to act. So we can either raise to 8 (standard) or maybe a larger raise (e.g., 12). Our stack is 154, but early position we want to protect JJ from being outdrawn. A raise to 8 is fine.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. So we can raise to any amount >=8. Minimum raise is 8, but we could raise larger. Considering we have 38 BB, maybe raise to 12 (3 BB) to thin the field. But we have no info on opponents' aggression. Since they have raised small amounts before, they may call or 3-bet. A raise to 12 may discourage many callers. I'd likely raise to 12 (3 BB) to get value and protect. However typical standard is 2-3 BB. Since we have 38 BB, 3 BB is fine.\n\nThus action: raise to 12. Reason: JJ strong, early position, want to thin field, build pot.\n\nCheck legal: raise_to 12.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need decide action. Hand QTs suited (Queens Ten suited). Position BTN, stacks 154, blinds 2/4, effective stack 154 (38.5 BB). Opponents: seat1 SB 2 chips (tiny stack?), seat2 BB 4 chips (tiny). Actually they have small stacks (2 and 4 chips). So they are short-stacked, likely all-in or push/fold. Minimum raise is 8, which is 2 BB. With such short stacks, we can consider raising to isolate, maybe shove.\n\nWe need consider opponent tendencies: seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking with 237 chips, seat2 Kimi-K2 212 chips. But they have only 2 and 4 chips left, meaning they are short-stacked and likely will go all-in or fold. Our raise to 8 is small relative to their stacks (they have 2 and 4). Actually they have less than 8, so they cannot call a raise to 8; they'd have to go all-in for less than that? In poker, if they have less than the raise amount, they can go all-in for their remaining chips, which is a call of the raise? Typically they'd be forced to either call the bet amount (4) or go all-in for 2 or 4. Since they are SB with 2 chips, they are already all-in? Wait they posted small blind 2, they have 2 chips total, so they are all-in for the blind. Similarly BB posted 4 and has 4 total, all-in. So they are already all-in. So the pot already includes their all-ins: SB 2, BB 4, plus our call 4 if we call, plus raise. Actually the pot is 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4). The SB is all-in for 2, BB all-in for 4. So we are facing a bet of 4 (BB). So if we call, we will match 4 and get to showdown. If we raise, we would raise to at least 8, but they cannot call more than their stack, they'd be all-in for less, but they'd be already all-in. So raising would just increase pot size with no additional opponent contributions, effectively a blind steal? Might be okay to raise to steal the blinds? Actually we are the BTN, we could raise to 8 to try to win the pot immediately; but they'd be all-in already, so they'd have no option to call raise; they'd just be out. So raising is just a bluff to win the pot without showdown. But if we raise, we risk more chips (8 total) vs calling 4. Since they are all-in, they cannot fold; they are already committed. So raising just adds chips to pot with no chance of them folding, but we could raise to isolate and maybe push them out? Actually they are already all-in, so they can't fold. So raising is just a bigger investment for no extra value; we could just call and win the pot if we have best hand at showdown, or lose if they have better hand. Since they are short stacked, they likely have a wide range of hands (any two cards). QTs suited is decent but not premium. Could consider folding if we think they have stronger range? But they are all-in for 2 and 4, they could have any hand. Our equity vs random hand: QTs suited vs random is about 57%? Actually QTs suited vs random is around 57%? Let's approximate: QTs suited vs random two cards: about 55% maybe. So calling is positive expected value.\n\nStack size: we have 154, calling 4 is negligible.\n\nThus best action: call.\n\nWe need to output JSON.",

Could have draws.\n\nWe have strong hand: top pair, plus draw. Pot is 10, we have 150 stack. Minimum raise is 4. Should we bet? Check-raise possible but we are BTN, can bet. We want to protect against draws and extract value. Opponent checked, likely weak. A bet of maybe 6-8? Minimum raise is 4, but we can raise to any amount up to stack. Since we have 150, we could bet 8-10 to build pot. But need to consider tournament stage: 150 chips is 37.5 BB, medium stack. We want to grow. So raise to maybe 12 (3 BB) to charge draws. Legal raise to any amount >=4. So choose raise_to 12.\n\nCheck: we can also check, but better to bet. So action: raise 12.\n\nWe need to ensure raise_to is total amount we put in, not additional. So we are putting 12 chips total. That is 8 more than current? Actually we have already 4 in pot preflop, pot 10 includes our 4 and BB 4 and SB folded. So raising to 12 means we add 8 more chips. That's okay.\n\nThus output.",

Opponent in BB (seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 239 chips, but they posted BB 4. MiniMax-M2 (seat4) is in UTG? Actually seat order: seat1 is Kimi, seat2 folded, seat3 folded, seat4 MiniMax, seat5 us. So positions: seat1 is SB? Wait SB is seat5, we posted 2. Seat1 is BB (big blind). Seat4 is presumably UTG? Actually with 5 players, order: seat1 is SB? No typical: seat1 is dealer button? Not given. But we have SB seat5, BB seat1. So seat4 is CO? Let's not worry.\n\nPreflop: we posted SB 2, BB posted 4, seat4 called 4 (so they called BB). So now it's our turn, amount to call is 2 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise total 8). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have 3c Ts, a weak hand. In SB vs BB and a caller, pot is 10 + 2 call? Actually pot currently: SB 2 + BB 4 + call 4 = 10. To call we need 2 more, making pot 12. Raise to 8 would be total 8 from us, which is extra 6 beyond call? Actually raise total 8 means we put 8 total, which is 6 more than call (2 to call + 6 raise). That would make pot 14? Let's compute: after raise to 8, pot = SB 2 + BB 4 + call 4 + raise 8 = 18? Wait we already posted 2, but raise to 8 means we add additional 6 (since we already have 2 in). So total contributions: SB 8, BB 4, other 4 = 16? Actually we contributed 8 total, but initial 2 counted, so add 6. So pot becomes 2+4+4+6 = 16. Yes.\n\nGiven hand is weak, likely fold. But we can consider potential to steal blinds? However there is a caller already (MiniMax) who called BB, so there is a live opponent in the pot. Raising with 3T is not advisable. So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: MiniMax raised preflop 8 in hand 31, maybe aggressive. But here they just called. So they might be willing to call raises. Our hand is not good.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

Js9c is a suited connector, decent but not premium. In tournament, 40 BB stack, button, can consider 3-bet if we think opponent is opening wide and we have fold equity. Opponent's raise size is 12 (3bb) which is standard open raise size. MiniMax-M2's raise history: only one raise recorded, amount 8 (maybe from earlier hand). Not much info. Likely a standard opener.\n\nJs9c is a decent hand for 3-bet in position if we want to isolate and potentially play post-flop. However with 40 BB, we need to be careful. 3-bet to maybe 30? Minimum raise is 20 (i.e., raise to 20 total). That would be a 5bb raise (since call 12, raise to 20). That's a modest 5bb raise, about 2.5x the original raise. That's a small 3-bet, could be a squeeze or a value raise. With Js9c, a small 3-bet may be okay to take advantage of position and potential to see flop cheap if called.\n\nAlternatively we can call 12, see flop out of position? Actually we are button, after raise we will be first to act preflop, but after flop we will be in position vs MiniMax. Calling 12 is 3bb, pot will be 30 after call (18+12). So pot odds good. Js9c has decent equity vs typical opener range (like TT+, AK, AQs, etc). But against a raise of 3bb, his range could be wide, maybe 22+, A2s+, K9s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T9s, 98s, ATo+, KJo+, QJo. Js9c is about 12% equity maybe. Might be okay to call.\n\nGiven stack 40 BB, we can also consider 3-betting to isolate and possibly steal the blinds later. But Js9c is not a premium 3-bet hand; 3-betting could be risky if opponent 4-bets all-in.\n\nI think best is to call and see flop, maintain stack, and be in position.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nCheck legal actions: call is allowed.\n\nProvide JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have board As Qh 4d. Our hand Js 9c gives us a gutshot straight draw (needs Ten) and a backdoor flush possibilities (clubs). Also we have overcards (Jack, Nine). The opponent MiniMax-M2 raised preflop to 12 (3x BB) from UTG? Actually seat 4 is likely UTG? Not sure. They are presumably a tighter player? Need to see opponent tendencies: we have some data: they bet small amounts on flop (2, 14, 6). So they might be making continuation bets, possibly with a range of top pair, overpairs, draws, etc. The current bet is 15 into pot 45, pot odds ~ 15/(45+15)=15/60=25% to call, need 25% equity. Our hand: with As Qh 4d board, we have no pair, but we have open-ended? Actually we have a gutshot: need Ten to make straight (J-10-9-8-7? Wait we have J and 9, board A Q 4. Straight possibilities: 10-J-Q-K-A? No we have J, need K and 10? Actually board: A Q 4. Our hand J9. Straight combos: 10-J-Q-K-A would need 10 and K, but we only have J; we need 10 and K? That's two cards, not possible. Another straight: 7-8-9-10-J would need 8 and 10. So we need 10 plus either 8 or K? Wait we have J9, board A Q 4. The only possible straight using our cards and board: 9-10-J-Q-K? Need 10 and K, but board doesn't have K. So we need both 10 and K on turn and river, unlikely. Also 4-5-6-7-8? No. So actually we have no straight draw. Let's think: With J9, board A Q 4, we have no pair, no draw. We have two overcards, but no made hand. So we are behind most of opponent's range (top pair Q, A, maybe a set of 4, etc). The opponent's bet 15 is a continuation bet; we have only 148 chips, 37 BB. Call 15 is ~10% of stack. Could consider a call as a cheap bluff catcher? But we have no showdown value. Could we raise as a bluff? Minimum raise to 30, would be 30 total (i.e., raise 15 more). That's 30 into pot 60 = 33% of pot. Our stack is 148, can raise. Opponent likely has a decent hand; raising might be too aggressive. Better to fold.\n\nCheck if opponent is aggressive? Past flop bets: small 2, 14, 6. That suggests they are variable but often small. This bet 15 is about 1/3 pot, typical. So folding is correct.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have K7 suited (spades). In BB with 17.5 BB stack, facing a raise to 24 (3BB) from seat 2 (Kimi-K2). The raise is 24 total (i.e., 24 chips). The big blind is 8, so raise size is 24, which is 3x BB. Actually minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise to 40). So opponent raised to 24, we need to call 16 more to see flop. Our hand K7s is marginal. In BB, we have 17.5 BB. K7s is not a premium hand; it's a suited king, decent for stealing blinds if we have position, but here we are out of position (BB vs raise from early? Not sure seat numbers but seat 2 is UTG? Actually seat numbers: seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (folded), seat 2 is Kimi-K2, seat 3 DeepSeek-V3.2, seat 4 MiniMax-M2, seat5 us. So seat 2 is to our left (under the gun). So early position raise. Our hand K7s is weak vs early raise; we could fold. Could also call to see flop if we think we have implied odds and can hit a flush or straight. But stack is shortish; calling 16 chips adds 16 to pot, pot will be 40 (preflop) + 24 raise + 8 call? Wait pot before action: blinds 4+8 =12, plus seat2 posted sb? Actually seat2 posted sb 4? That's weird: seat2 is SB? Actually seat2 posted sb 4 (small blind), seat3 posted bb 8 (big blind). But we are seat5 BB? Wait confusion: The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". But actions show seat2 post_sb 4, seat3 post_bb 8, seat4 fold, seat5 call 8, seat1 fold, seat2 raise 24, seat3 fold. So seat5 (us) called 8 (big blind). So seat3 posted BB 8, but seat5 also called 8? That seems contradictory. Possibly the game is weird: maybe seat5 is the BB, but seat3 posted BB earlier? Actually seat3 posted bb 8, then seat5 (us) called 8 as well? That would be like we are in the cutoff? But they say our position is BB. Maybe they mis-ordered. But the pot is 40 chips (maybe includes blinds and a call). Let's trust that we are in BB and we already posted 8 (big blind). Now opponent raised to 24 (i.e., 3x). So we need to call 16 more.\n\nStack 140, we have 17.5 BB. K7s is marginal. Usually fold vs early raise unless we have good implied odds and deep stack; but stack is shallow. So likely fold.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: recall shows they often raise small amounts (6,8,10,12). This raise to 24 is larger (3BB). Might be stronger range. So folding is prudent.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

Both have decent stacks. Preflop: seat1 posted SB 4, seat2 posted BB 8. So we are on button, after SB and BB, we act. Amount to call 8 (BB). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise by at least 8 more). Hand Q2 suited spades, very weak. With short stack, maybe consider shove? But we have 17.5 BB, can push all-in for 140 chips. However, raising to 16 is small relative to stack. Should we fold? Q2 suited is very weak, but we could steal blinds. With 17.5 BB, pushing all-in might be okay if we think opponents will fold. However, they are early position? Actually they are SB and BB, they have already posted. SB is seat1, BB seat2. Both have larger stacks. Their tendencies: recall shows Kimi-K2 Thinking raises preflop amounts 6,12,30,6,14. Those are raises relative to blinds? Likely these are raise amounts (maybe total bet?). Hard to interpret. But they have raised preflop before. Might be aggressive.\n\nGiven our stack, we could either call (i.e., just match BB) but that would be a limp, not typical with short stack. Could raise to 16 (small raise) then maybe get re-raised. Better to either fold or go all-in. Q2 suited is not a steal candidate; typical push range from button with 17 BB might include any two cards? Actually typical push range is quite wide, but Q2 suited is maybe okay? In tournament, with 17 BB, push/fold strategy suggests you can push with any hand that is at least as good as 12% of combos? Q2 suited maybe borderline. But given opponents have shown willingness to raise preflop, they may call or re-raise. Might be too risky.\n\nThus likely fold.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #49, preflop BB with 7s Kc. Stack 128 (16 BB). Blinds 4/8, posted SB 4, BB posted 8. So we are out of position vs seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) who posted BB? Actually seat1 is BB? Wait seat1 posted bb 8. So seat1 is the other player (only other active). So it's heads-up (only two players). We are BB, seat1 is the button? Actually seat1 is after us? Let's see order: Seat5 (us) is BB, seat1 is SB? Wait the blind posting: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4 (so seat5 is SB). But earlier says our position BB seat5. In actions: Seat5 post_sb 4, Seat1 post_bb 8. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But the description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". That conflicts. The actions show seat5 posted SB, seat1 posted BB. Possibly the description mislabels. But we have to trust the actions: seat5 (us) posted SB 4, seat1 posted BB 8. So we are SB with 7s Kc, stack 128 (16BB). Amount to call is 4 (to call BB 8? Actually we posted SB 4, now need to call 8? Wait we already posted SB 4, the BB is 8, so to call we need to put additional 4 to match BB 8). Yes amount to call 4. Minimum raise to 16 (total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nSo we are SB with K7 offsuit (7s Kc). In heads-up, K7 suited? Actually 7s Kc is offsuit (spade 7, club K). In heads-up, K7 off is decent but not premium. Stack 16BB, we are shortish. Opponent seat1's tendencies: from recall, they have raised preflop once (hand 46 raise 24). Also they have bet on flop (hand 39 bet 8, hand44 bet 12). They have also check-call patterns. Overall they seem to be somewhat aggressive (raise 24 preflop). But not sure about range.\n\nWe need to decide: call, raise, or fold. With K7 off, in heads-up short stack, calling is okay to see flop cheap. Raising to 16 (total) would be 8 more after call? Actually raise to total 16 means we put 16 total, which is 8 more than call amount (since we already have 4 posted). That would be a raise of 8 (to 16). Minimum raise is 16 total, which is 8 over call? Wait call amount is 4 (to match BB 8). To raise to 16 total, we need to put total 16, which is 12 more than our current 4 (since we already posted 4). So raise amount = 12 (makes pot 4+8+12=24). That's a raise of 8 over call? Actually call would be 4 more to reach 8. So raise to 16 is +8 beyond call? Wait compute: we have 4 posted, opponent has 8 posted. To call, we need to add 4 (total 8). To raise to 16 total, we need to add 12 (total 16). So raise amount is 12, which is 8 over call. That seems okay.\n\nGiven stack 16BB, raising may isolate and maybe we can go all-in later. But K7 off is not strong enough to raise for value; but could be a steal? In heads-up, SB raising can be good but opponent is BB, likely to defend. Opponent's BB may be aggressive (raised preflop before). But we have no read that they raise often. Might be okay to call and see flop.\n\nPot odds: current pot 12 (SB+BB). If we call 4, pot becomes 16. Effective stack after call: opponent has 128-8=120, we have 124 left after call? Actually we have 128-8 (SB+call) = 120 left. So pot odds fine.\n\nGiven K7 off, I'd call.\n\nThus output JSON with action call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are in SB with 7s Kc, stack 128, effective stack 128 (others have more). The amount to call is 4 (to match BB 8? Actually SB posted 4, BB posted 8, so we need to call 4 more to match BB). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total bet 16). So we can fold, call 4, or raise to at least 16.\n\nWe have 7\u2660 K\u2663. In SB vs BB heads-up, typical strategy: raise with a wide range, but with 16 BB stack, we could consider a raise to steal BB. 7K offsuit is decent, but not premium. However, we have 16 BB, and BB is Kimi-K2. We have some data: opponent's raise amounts vary; they sometimes raise 6,8,10,12,24. They seem to raise larger amounts sometimes. In this situation, we are SB, they are BB. They posted 8, we can raise to 16 (total). That would be a 12 raise (8+? Actually to 16 total). That's a 2x BB raise. Could be a standard raise.\n\nBut we need to consider stack depth: 16 BB, we could also shove. 7K offsuit is not a good all-in hand. So better to raise to 16 and see flop. But also consider that BB may re-raise all-in. With 7K off, not great against re-raise. But calling 4 is cheap, see flop cheap. However, if we call, we will be out of position after flop (SB vs BB, BB is in position). Actually after flop, action starts with SB first (since BB posted last). So SB acts first. So calling gives us position on flop? In heads-up, after flop, SB acts first (since they are \"under the gun\"). So we would be out of position (act first). That's disadvantage.\n\nRaising can gain initiative and maybe win pot preflop. 7K offsuit is a decent raise in SB vs BB. So raise to 16 seems good.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 16.

Then BB raised to 16 (so effectively 8 raise). Seat1 called 8 (so now pot: initial 4+8 + raise 8? Actually preflop pot: SB 4, BB 8, then BB raise to 16 (adds extra 8), seat1 call 8 => total contributions: SB 4, BB 16, seat1 16? Wait seat1 call 8 means they call the raise amount of 8 extra? Actually they called the raise of 8, so they put 8+? They already posted 4? No seat1 is in SB? Wait seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking - they posted SB 4, then they are seat1? Actually seat numbers: seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 is Kimi-K2, seat3 DeepSeek, seat4 MiniMax, seat5 GPT-OSS. The blinds: SB is seat? Usually seat left of dealer posts SB, then BB. Not sure. But actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB? Wait our position is BB (Seat5) according to hand description. But actions say seat5 posted sb. Contradiction. Maybe seat numbers shifted; but description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So seat5 is BB, but actions say seat5 posted sb 4. Might be error. Anyway we raised preflop to 16, and seat1 called. So we are the aggressor, now flop.\n\nFlop: 2h Jc Tc. Board gives straight draw possibilities. Our hand: 7s Kc. We have gutshot? Board: 2-10-J. Our K gives us top pair? Actually we have Kc, board has Jc, Tc, 2h. No King on board, so we have overpair? No, we have K high, but board has J and T, so K is higher than both, but not a pair. So we have \"King high\" with a backdoor straight draw? 7 can make straight with 8-9? Not relevant. So we have nothing. Opponent (seat1) called preflop raise, likely has a range: could be broadway combos, maybe J,T, Q, K, A, etc. Flop is Jc Tc 2h. This is a very good flop for many hands: any J, any T, any Q (open-ended straight draw), any K (top pair), any A (gutshot? Actually A with K? Not). Also any pair of 2. Our Kc is top pair? No, we have K, not pair. So we have just a King high, not a made hand. We are out of position (since we raised preflop, but flop action order: who acts first? Usually the player left of the button (SB) acts first preflop, but after flop, the first active player to the left of the dealer acts. Dealer is seat? Not given. But we are BB, which is usually after SB. The flop action: Since we raised preflop, we are the preflop aggressor, but on flop, the SB (if still in) would act first, then BB, then others. However SB folded preflop? Actually seat5 posted sb, we are seat5, but we raised preflop, so we are the raiser. The other player (seat1) is BB, who called. So on flop, the action starts with the player left of the button (SB) which is us? Actually if we are SB and we raised, we are first to act preflop. On flop, the first to act is the player left of the button (SB) which is us. So we act first on flop. That matches \"Amount to call: 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise\". So we can check or raise.\n\nWe have a weak hand. Should we check and possibly fold to a bet? Or we could try a continuation bet (c-bet) to represent strength. Our stack is 116, pot 32. We could raise to maybe 24-32 to apply pressure. Opponent's range includes many combos that have hit this flop (J, T, Q, K). So a c-bet may be called or raised. But we have no equity. Better to check and see what opponent does. If they bet, we can decide to fold unless they bet small and we have some draw? We have backdoor straight"

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB (seat5) with 7s Kc. Stack 116 chips, 14.5 BB. Blinds 4/8. Preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8. Then BB raised to 16 (so effectively 8 raise). Seat1 called 8 (so now pot: initial 4+8 + raise 8? Actually preflop pot: SB 4, BB 8, then BB raise to 16 (adds extra 8), seat1 call 8 => total contributions: SB 4, BB 16, seat1 16? Wait seat1 call 8 means they call the raise amount of 8 extra? Actually they called the raise of 8, so they put 8+? They already posted 4? No seat1 is in SB? Wait seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking - they posted SB 4, then they are seat1? Actually seat numbers: seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 is Kimi-K2, seat3 DeepSeek, seat4 MiniMax, seat5 GPT-OSS. The blinds: SB is seat? Usually seat left of dealer posts SB, then BB. Not sure. But actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB? Wait our position is BB (Seat5) according to hand description. But actions say seat5 posted sb. Contradiction. Maybe seat numbers shifted; but description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So seat5 is BB, but actions say seat5 posted sb 4. Might be error. Anyway we raised preflop to 16, and seat1 called. So we are the aggressor, now flop.\n\nFlop: 2h Jc Tc. Board gives straight draw possibilities. Our hand: 7s Kc. We have gutshot? Board: 2-10-J. Our K gives us top pair? Actually we have Kc, board has Jc, Tc, 2h. No King on board, so we have overpair? No, we have K high, but board has J and T, so K is higher than both, but not a pair. So we have \"King high\" with a backdoor straight draw? 7 can make straight with 8-9? Not relevant. So we have nothing. Opponent (seat1) called preflop raise, likely has a range: could be broadway combos, maybe J,T, Q, K, A, etc. Flop is Jc Tc 2h. This is a very good flop for many hands: any J, any T, any Q (open-ended straight draw), any K (top pair), any A (gutshot? Actually A with K? Not). Also any pair of 2. Our Kc is top pair? No, we have K, not pair. So we have just a King high, not a made hand. We are out of position (since we raised preflop, but flop action order: who acts first? Usually the player left of the button (SB) acts first preflop, but after flop, the first active player to the left of the dealer acts. Dealer is seat? Not given. But we are BB, which is usually after SB. The flop action: Since we raised preflop, we are the preflop aggressor, but on flop, the SB (if still in) would act first, then BB, then others. However SB folded preflop? Actually seat5 posted sb, we are seat5, but we raised preflop, so we are the raiser. The other player (seat1) is BB, who called. So on flop, the action starts with the player left of the button (SB) which is us? Actually if we are SB and we raised, we are first to act preflop. On flop, the first to act is the player left of the button (SB) which is us. So we act first on flop. That matches \"Amount to call: 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise\". So we can check or raise.\n\nWe have a weak hand. Should we check and possibly fold to a bet? Or we could try a continuation bet (c-bet) to represent strength. Our stack is 116, pot 32. We could raise to maybe 24-32 to apply pressure. Opponent's range includes many combos that have hit this flop (J, T, Q, K). So a c-bet may be called or raised. But we have no equity. Better to check and see what opponent does. If they bet, we can decide to fold unless they bet small and we have some draw? We have backdoor straight",

The board: 10-J-? Actually we have 10, J, 2. With K we have overcards, but we have a gutshot? Straight possibilities: 9-8-? Not. To make a straight we need Q for JQK? Actually we have K, board J,T,2. To make straight we need Q and 9? No. Straight combos: 9-8-? Not. Let's enumerate: With K, need Q and 9? Actually K-J-10 forms K-J-10? That's not a straight. Need Q and 9 to make 9-10-J-Q-K. We have K, need Q and 9. No 9 on board. So we have gutshot to a straight (needs Q and 9). Also we have two overcards (K) and a gutshot.\n\nWe are in BB, stack 116, pot 52, opponent bet 20. Opponent is Kimi-K2 (seat1) with 231 chips, likely UTG? Actually seat1 is small blind? Wait position: seat1 is SB? The blinds: SB seat5? Actually they posted sb 4 (seat5), bb 8 (seat1). So seat1 is BB? Wait seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So seat5 is SB (we are BB? Actually description says Position: BB (Seat5). But they posted sb 4. Inconsistent. The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". But actions show seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So maybe the roles swapped: seat5 is SB but they call it BB. Anyway we are the small blind? Actually seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So seat5 is SB. But they say BB. We'll ignore.\n\nWe have 116 chips left after posting sb 4? Actually stack includes posted sb? Usually stack after posting is remaining. So we have 116 chips left (including sb posted? Usually stack after posting is net). So effective stack is 116.\n\nOpponent bet 20 into pot 52, so pot after bet = 72 (including bet). To call 20, pot odds: 20/(52+20)=20/72\u224827.8% needed to break even. Our hand equity: we have gutshot (2 outs? Actually need Q and 9. That's 2 outs each 4 suits = 8 outs. Also we have K which is top pair? No board doesn't have K. So we have 8 outs. Plus maybe we have backdoor flush draws? We have 7s, board has 2h, Jc, Tc. No spades on board, so we have 7s as one spade, could get flush draw if turn and river spades. That's 12 spades left? Actually spades: 13 total, 1 in our hand, none on board, so 12 spades left, but need two spades to complete flush, so probability lower. But main equity ~8 outs => ~18% on flop turn+river? Actually after turn, probability to hit by river ~ 15%? On flop, chance to hit by river = 1 - (44/47)*(43/46) \u2248 1 - 0.936*0.935 = 1 - 0.874 = 0.126. So ~12.6% for straight. Add flush possibilities maybe ~6%? So total maybe ~18-20% equity.\n\nPot odds 27.8% > equity, so call is negative expected value. However we could consider raise to bluff? Opponent bet 20, we could raise to 40 (minimum raise) to represent strong hand. But our stack is 116, we could raise to 40, opponent might fold? Opponent's tendencies unknown. We can recall opponent's flop betting patterns. We attempted recall but none found. So unknown.\n\nGiven we are short stack (14.5 BB). We may want to preserve chips. Our hand is weak.

We can raise to isolate or to build pot.\n\nStack is 116, we have 14.5 BB. Raising to 16 (minimum) would be about 2 BB raise (since big blind 8). That's modest.

So I think raise to 24 (3 BB) would be good: it's 24 total, which is 3 BB (since 8 BB). Actually 24 total is 3*8 = 24, so raise to 24 (i.e., raise by 16 more).

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand Js Ks, position BTN, stack 92 chips (11.5 BB). Blinds 4/8, pot currently 96 (includes blinds and raises). Action: we raised to 24 (3xBB) after small blind posted 4 and big blind posted 8, and MiniMax called 8 (so pot 4+8+8+24=44? Wait compute: SB 4, BB 8, MiniMax call 8, we raise to 24 (so we put 24). Then Seat1 folds, Seat2 (big blind) raises to 60 (so they added 52 more? Actually they raise to 60 total, meaning they put 60 chips total). So now we need to call 36 more to match 60 (since we already have 24 in). Minimum raise to 96 (i.e., raise at least to 96 total). Our stack is 92, so we cannot raise to 96; we could go all-in for 92 total (i.e., raise to 92). That would be an all-in raise, which is allowed if raise is legal? The legal actions: fold, call, raise. Since we cannot meet minimum raise, we can go all-in as a raise? Usually if you cannot raise to the minimum, you can go all-in but it's considered a call? In many rules, you cannot raise less than minimum unless it's all-in. So we could either call 36 (leaving us 56 chips left) or go all-in for 92 (i.e., raise to 92). Decision: Js Ks is a strong hand, especially in short stack situation, but we are out of position after the raise. The opponent (Seat2) is Kimi-K2 with 164 chips, about 20 BB. They raised to 60 (3.75 BB) after our raise. That's a sizable raise. With JsKs, we have decent equity but not a premium hand. In short stack tournament, we could consider shoving all-in to try to double up, but risk being called by a stronger hand (e.g., AK, AQ, TT+, etc.). Our stack 92, we are 11.5 BB, we are short. The pot currently is 96 chips (including our 24, their 60, blinds). If we call, we will have 56 left, still short. Might be okay to call and see flop? But with such short stack, playing post-flop is risky. Better to go all-in to maximize fold equity. Opponent may have a wide range? They are the BB, maybe defending. They raised after our raise; could be a 3-bet with strong hand. Their stack 164, they could be looking to pressure short stacks. I think shoving all-in is reasonable.\n\nThus action: raise to 92 (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, strong hand, want to apply pressure, cannot meet min raise, so go all-in.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action. Situation: we are BTN with JsKs (Jack suited King). Stack 20 chips (2.5 BB). Wait stack is 20 chips, but blinds are 4/8, so big blind is 8, small blind 4. Our stack 20 means we have 2.5 BB total. Pot currently 272 chips? That seems huge relative to stacks. Something off: The pot is 272 chips, but players have low stacks. Probably previous pot from earlier hands? But anyway.\n\nPreflop actions: Seat1 posted small blind 4 (but they folded later). Seat2 posted big blind 8. Seat3 folded, Seat4 called 8 (so they put 8 in). Seat5 (us) raise 24 (so we raised to 24 total? That's 3x BB). Then Seat1 fold, Seat2 raise 60 (so they re-raise to 60). Seat4 fold, Seat5 raise 96 (we re-raise to 96). Then Seat2 raise 164 (they 3-bet? Actually they 4-bet). So now amount to call is 68 (since they raised to 164, we have put 96, need 68 more). Minimum raise to 232. Legal actions: fold, call. So we cannot raise because we don't have enough chips? Our stack is 20 chips total, but we have already put 96? Something inconsistent. Maybe chip counts are not actual; perhaps the stack numbers are in chips but the pot is huge due to tournament? Actually we have 20 chips left, but we already put 96? That can't be. So maybe the stack numbers are relative to something else. Perhaps the stack numbers are in big blinds? No. Something is off.\n\nNevertheless, the legal actions are fold or call. So we can call 68 more chips, which would bring our total investment to 164, which likely exceeds our stack? But we have 20 chips only. Something contradictory. Probably the stack numbers are not accurate; maybe our stack is 200 chips? But they say 20 chips (2.5 BB). That would be 20 chips total, but we have already invested 96, which is impossible. So maybe the pot is in some other unit. Regardless, the system says we can only fold or call.\n\nWe have JsKs, a decent hand, but deep in a short stack. The effective stack after opponent's 164 raise likely leaves us with maybe 20 left? Actually we have 20 chips total; we have already contributed 96, leaving -? So maybe the numbers are misaligned but the decision is forced: we can either call or fold. Since we have a strong hand (broadway suited) and short stack, we likely should call (or go all-in). But we cannot raise.\n\nGiven short stack, we should call and be all-in. So choose call.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

With 5 high, we likely should check. Raising would be a bluff, but we have no equity and risk losing chips. In tournament, preserve stack. So check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call 0, so check is fine.\n\nThus output: action check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Seat1 is UTG? The seats: Seat1 is likely UTG (since seat5 is BB). So 3-bet from UTG. We have ATo. How to play? Consider opponent's 3-bet range: likely strong (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK, maybe AQ, maybe AJs, maybe KQs). ATo is a decent but maybe marginal. With deep stack, could consider 4-bet or call. 4-bet size? Minimum raise to 20 (so raise to at least 20). That would be 20 total, meaning additional 12 beyond call. That is a 2.5x raise over 3-bet (12). Could be a strong move. But we need to consider stack sizes: Kimi-K2 has 176 chips (approx 88 BB). We have 193 chips (96 BB). So we could 4-bet all-in? All-in would be 193 (but min raise to 20). All-in is huge. Might be too risky. Could call and see flop, but we are out of position (we are still in BB after 3-bet, but we will be out of position preflop? Actually after 3-bet, we are in the big blind, but we are the only caller if we call, we will be out of position postflop vs Kimi in UTG (first to act). So calling is okay if we think we have equity vs his range. ATo vs typical 3-bet range: equity maybe around 45% vs a tight range. Might be okay to call.\n\nBut also we could 4-bet as a bluff or for value. Our hand is not a top 3-bet hand. So likely call is best.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nCheck legal: call is allowed.

But amount to call 0 indicates no bet yet. So we can check or raise. Considering our hand is weak, we likely check. Could also consider a bluff raise?

Our stack 185, pot after bet will be 43+16=59 (if we call). We need to consider hand strength: we have Ace high with a Ten. No pair, no draw. Potential: Overcards Ace and Ten. Board: K,9,2. Opponent could have Kx, 9x, A? Actually Ace is overcard; Ten could give straight draw? Board: 2-9-K, Ten not connecting. Straight possibilities: 8-7-6-5-4 etc not relevant. So we have only Ace high, maybe a gutshot? No. So likely losing. Opponent's bet size 16 is about 1/3 pot. Could be continuation bet from preflop raise 12 (they raised to 12 after our raise to 4). Preflop action: we raised to 4 (from BB), they 3-bet to 12, we called. So they are the aggressor preflop, likely have a range of strong hands: broadways, AK, AQ, AJ, KQ, maybe suited connectors, pairs. On flop K9-2, they bet 16 (c-bet). Our hand Ace Ten is weak. Should we fold? Yes, likely fold. However consider stack depth: 185 chips, we have 92.5 BB, not short. Fold is safe.\n\nCheck if any opponent tendencies: We have limited data. Use recall_opponent_actions for flop bets. Already attempted but no data. So we assume typical.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Actually Kc8s is suited, but still not great. Could consider raising to steal BB and maybe get folds, but there is a caller already (seat4).

So we have a weak hand, likely losing. Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) called preflop from SB? Actually seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2, they called 2 preflop, so they have a hand that they think is decent. On flop, they might bet? But we have no info yet; we need to decide action: options are check or raise (fold not possible because amount to call 0). We could check, hoping to see turn cheap, or we could raise as a bluff. Need to consider stack sizes: we have 180 chips, opponent also 180. Pot is 5 chips. Minimum raise to 2 (so raise to 2? Actually raise_to is total amount, so raise to 2 means just call? Minimum raise is 2 meaning raise by at least 2 chips? Usually raise to 4? But they say minimum raise to: 2. Since amount to call is 0, raise to 2 means putting 2 chips total, which is a raise of 2 chips. That is a small raise.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, we might want to check and see if opponent bets. If they bet, we can decide to call maybe? But likely they have a decent hand like Kx, 5x, etc. Could we bluff? Small raise of 2 chips (pot 5) is 0.4 pot, could be a probe. But with pocket pair of 2s, low chance of improvement: need set on turn or river (two outs? Actually there are two 2s left). Probability of hitting set by river: about (2/47)*(1 - something). Not great.\n\nGiven tournament, preserve chips. So best is check.\n\nThus output JSON with action check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Straight draws: board 5-6, we have 2s,2c. No open-ended straight draws (need 4-7). Not present. So we have a weak pair, likely losing to any overpair (Kx, 5x, 6x) and also to any Ace, etc. Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 3 into pot 8 (so pot becomes 11). We have 180 chips left, stack large relative to pot. Should we fold? Likely yes. But consider opponent's tendencies: Past flop actions: check, fold, check. So they are not aggressive on flop generally. But this time they bet small 3 (about 0.5 BB). Could be a continuation bet with a wide range, maybe they have K, 5, 6, or a draw, or they could be bluffing. Our hand is very weak; we have no equity. The pot odds: need to call 3 to win 11 (pot before call) plus 3 = 14 total? Actually pot is 8, bet 3, so pot after call would be 11+3? Wait compute: pre-flop pot 8 (includes blinds and call). Flop: we check, opponent bets 3, so pot becomes 11 (8+3). To call, we put 3, making pot 14. So we get 3/14 = 21.4% required equity. Our equity with pocket deuces vs unknown range?

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand: SB with Ks8d. Stack 179 chips, blinds 1/2, pot 5. Action: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, MP (seat 4) called 2 (so they just called the BB). Now amount to call is 1 (to match BB's 2). Minimum raise to 4 (so raise to total 4). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength. Ks8 offsuit is a marginal hand in SB vs a single caller (likely MP). Position: after flop, we will be out of position (SB vs BB and MP). Stack: 179 chips (~90 BB) deep. So we can play a bit looser but still need to consider tournament stage? Not given stage but early.\n\nOpponent (seat 4, MiniMax-M2) appears to be very tight: many folds preflop, occasional calls, rarely raises. In the data, they called preflop with 2 chips (i.e., a limp) in hand 9 and 14. In hand 9 they bet on flop after limping (bet 2 into pot? Not sure). So they might be a passive player who limps and then bets small.\n\nThus, we could consider raising to isolate and take advantage of their passivity. However Ks8 offsuit is not a premium hand, but still decent for a raise from SB, especially against a limper. Raising to 4 (i.e., 2x big blind) is a standard raise. It could also be a squeeze if there were more callers, but only one caller.\n\nIf we raise, we risk being called and playing out of position with a weak hand. But we could also fold if we think it's not worth it. In early tournament, we can be selective.\n\nGiven opponent's tightness, raising could be good to take down the pot preflop or get heads-up with a slight edge? Actually we have K high, but opponent might have a range of decent hands (like A-x, K-Q, Q-J, etc). Ks8 offsuit is not great vs that range.\n\nWe could also just call the 1 chip and see flop out of position, but that is cheap and we can fold later. However calling a limp is generally suboptimal; raising isolates and can win the pot immediately.\n\nGiven the stack depth, raising to 4 is low risk. I'd raise to 4.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 4, reasoning: isolate a tight limper, take advantage of position, and avoid playing out of position with marginal hand.\n\n",

Considering they raise small, a raise to 12 could be a re-raise? But we are first to act. Actually they are not yet acted; we are UTG, they are after us. So we can raise to 8 (2BB) as a standard open. Might be fine. But could also just call? No, calling 4 is not typical from UTG; you would either raise or fold. Folding might be safe. However with 46 BB, you could open with a wide range; JhTc is borderline. Many players open from UTG with JTs suited; offsuit is weaker. I'd lean to fold. But we have information: opponents are aggressive, may 3-bet small. If we raise, we may get 3-bet and be in a tough spot. Might be better to fold.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\n",

Seats 1 and 2 folded. Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised to 8 (so raise of 4 more? Actually they raised 8 total, meaning they put 8 chips, which is 2x big blind). So they raised 8, meaning they raised 4 over the BB? Wait: BB posted 4, raise to 8 means they put in 8 total, i.e., they raised 4 more. Minimum raise to 12 (so raise must be to at least 12). Amount to call is 4 (to match 8). So we can fold, call 4 (making pot 12), or raise to at least 12 total (i.e., add 8 more). Our hand K T offsuit in BB vs a raise from UTG? Actually seat3 is maybe MP? We don't know position but seat3 is after seat2 (who folded). So seat3 is in early position? Seats: seat1 is UTG? Not sure. But we are BB, so we are out of position post-flop. K T offsuit is a decent hand but not premium. In a 45 BB stack, calling 4 (1 BB) is cheap. We could call and see flop. Opponent raised only to 8 (2x BB), which is small. Could be a wide raise. So calling is fine. Raising could be possible to isolate, but we have only moderate hand. Raising to 12 would be 8 more chips (2 BB). Might be okay if we want to take initiative. However K T offsuit is not great for 3-bet. Better to call and see flop.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: We only have one raise record: hand 15 raise 8. Not enough info.

Wait preflop: seat3 raise 8, seat4 fold, seat5 call 4 (so we called the raise, putting 4 more to total 8). So pot after preflop: blinds 2+4=6, plus raise 8 from seat3 and call 4 from us? Actually seat3 raised to 8 (so he put 8 total). We called 4 more, making our total 8 as well. So pot = 2+4+8+8 = 22? But given pot 18 chips on flop. Maybe they count only contributions after flop?

Opponent may have missed flop, we could attempt a c-bet? But we are out of position (BB vs raise preflop). Actually we are in position? On flop, action starts with first active player left of button? Since we are BB, after flop the first to act is seat1? But seat1 folded preflop. Seat2 folded. So seat3 (DeepSeek) is first to act. But we are given \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning it's our turn and no bet yet. So opponent hasn't acted yet on flop. So we can check, and then opponent will act. If we check, we give them chance to bet. If they bet, we can decide. Could also raise as a semi-bluff but we have no draws. Likely not good.\n\nThus we should check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

He is likely representing a range of strong hands and draws. Our hand has no equity, just high cards. We have 0 outs to improve to pair (K or T not on board). So calling would be a lose expectation. Pot odds: need to call 8 to win 34 (pot after bet?), actually pot currently 26, opponent bet 8 makes pot 34, we call 8 to win 34, pot odds 8/34 = 23.5% needed. Our equity is near 0% (maybe some chance to hit a straight on turn? Ten could make straight with 9-8-6? Actually board 2-7-3, to make straight we need 4-5-6-8-9 etc. Ten not relevant.

In this hand they posted big blind only; they haven't acted yet. So we have option to raise to 8 minimum (so raise 4 more). With 6c7d, a raise from SB is possible as a steal attempt. But the BB is likely to defend with a wide range. Our stack is 174, we could raise to 8 (2BB) which is small. Might be okay to just call and see flop cheap.

We have 6-7 gives a gutshot to 4 for straight 4-5-6-7-8? Wait need 4 and 8? Let's analyze: board 5,5,3. Our hand 6,7. Possible combos: we have a gutshot straight draw to a 4 (4-5-6-7-8) missing 4 and 8. Actually need both 4 and 8? Straight 4-5-6-7-8: we have 6,7, board 5,5,3. Need 4 and 8. So not a draw. We have a pair? No. We have a backdoor flush? Suits: board hearts hearts diamonds. Our suits: 6c (clubs), 7d (diamonds). So we have one diamond (7d) plus board has diamond 5d, so we have a flush draw? Need 2 more diamonds, not possible. So we have basically just high card 7, maybe a gutshot? Not strong.\n\nOpponent Kimi-K2 is in seat 1, they are SB? Actually seat 1 is SB? Wait blinds: seat5 BB, seat1 SB? Actually preflop: seat5 post_sb 2 (so seat5 is SB) and seat1 post_bb 4 (so seat1 is BB). So we are SB with 2 chips, they are BB with 4. They checked preflop. Now flop: amount to call 0, they have checked? Actually we have legal actions: fold, check, raise. So they haven't acted yet? The flop action order: SB first? Usually SB acts first preflop, but post-flop, the first active player left of button. Button is seat? Not given. Since only two players left (SB and BB). The SB is seat5, BB seat1. The SB acts first on flop. So we have option to bet/raise or check. Opponent's flop behavior? We can recall their past flop checks. We saw they checked flop twice before.\n\nGiven our weak hand, we likely want to check and see a cheap turn. Raising might be a bluff but risk. Our stack 172, pot 8. Minimum raise to 4 means raise to 4 total? Actually raise to total amount of 4 (i.e., bet 4). That would be 4 into pot 8, pot becomes 12. Not huge. Could be a small bet to try to take pot. But we have no equity, but could be a bluff. Opponent may call with weak. But they have been checking. Might be passive.\n\nGiven tournament, preserve chips. So check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Board: 5d 5h 3h 7s. Our hand: 6c 7d. We have pair of sevens (7s on board, we have 7d) so we have top pair? Actually board has a 7 on board, we have 7d, so we have a pair of sevens (one on board, one in hand). Also we have a straight draw? Let's see: board: 5-5-3-7. Our 6 gives us a gutshot? 5-6-7 is a straight draw needing 4 or 8. We have 6c, board has 5,5,7, so need 4 or 8 for straight. Not strong. Also possible flush? Board has hearts: 5h,3h. We have no hearts. So no flush draw.\n\nWe have middle pair (7s) but board also has pair of fives, so two pair possible for opponent. Opponent (Seat 1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 233 chips, still a big stack. No bets yet, both checked flop. Turn is now? The actions list: preflop, flop both checked. So it's turn, and it's our action? Actually seat 5 is us, seat 1 is opponent. The order: BB is seat 5, SB seat1. Preflop: seat5 posted small blind? Actually blind structure: SB 2, BB 4. But seat5 is BB, posted 4? The logs show seat5 post_sb 2 and seat1 post_bb 4. That suggests seat5 is SB? Wait they said Position: BB (Seat5). But logs: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 2 (small blind). Seat1 post_bb 4 (big blind). So seat5 is SB actually, but they said BB? Might be reversed. Regardless, after preflop, seat5 called 2 (to match BB 4?), Actually they call 2? The BB is 4, they call 2? This is weird. Anyway, they are in the small blind maybe.\n\nNow turn: after flop checks, it's our turn? Usually action proceeds from SB first? On flop, after preflop, SB acts first. They both checked, so after flop, the first to act is SB (seat5). So it's our turn on turn. Amount to call: 0, min raise 4. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe have a pair of sevens, but board pair of fives. Opponent could have a higher pair like 5x, or maybe a set of 5s? But there are two 5s on board, set would be 5x in hand (full house). Opponent could have 5x (full house), or 7x for trips (but board only one 7, need another 7 in hand for trips). We have one 7, so we have trips? Wait board has 7s (7s). Actually board shows 7s (spade). So there is a single 7 on board. With our 7d, we have a pair of sevens (pair). Not trips. Opponent could have 7x for trips (two 7s). But they would need another 7, only one left (clubs). So they could have 7c, giving them trips. That's possible.\n\nAlso opponent could have a straight draw, like 4-8 combos.\n\nWe have 172 chips, opponent 233. Small stack relative to blinds 2/4, we have 43 BB, decent.\n\nGiven we have weak hand, likely check and see river.\n\nBut maybe consider raising to steal pot? The pot is 8 chips, small. Raising to 8 (min raise 4) would be a small raise. Opponent could call with any pair or draw. Might not be good.\n\nThus best is check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. No call because amount to call 0.\n\nWe choose check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Our hand gives us second 7, so we have a pair of 7s, board also has pair of 5s. So our hand is two pair: 7s and 5s. Board also has 5s pair, plus 7. So we have two pair (7s and 5s) with kicker 6.

If opponent has one, they'd have trips (three sevens) but board also has pair of 5s, so they'd have full house? Actually they'd have three sevens plus pair of 5s = full house (sevens full of fives). That's stronger than our two pair.\n\nOpponent could also have 5x for full house (fives full of something). If they have a 5, they'd have three 5s plus a 7 -> full house (fives full of sevens). Also could have 4-4 for full house? No board has one 4, they'd need two 4s to make trips 4s, but board only one 4. Full house requires trips plus a pair; they'd need trips of 4s plus pair of 5s? Not possible.\n\nCould have a straight? Board: 5,5,3,7,4. Straight possibilities: 3-4-5-6-7. We have a 6, we have a straight! Actually we have 6c, board has 3,4,5,7.

Actually there are four sixes, we have 6c, remaining 6s,6h,6d. If opponent has a 6, they'd also have straight (but tie? Our straight uses 6 and board's 3-4-5-7. Opponent also with 6 would have same straight, tie. Could they have a higher straight? Board doesn't have 8,9 etc. So max straight is 3-4-5-6-7.

Seat2 (BB) Kimi-K2 has raise amounts 6,8,6,6,8. So generally small raises 3BB to 4BB. Both are relatively aggressive? Not sure.\n\nWe are on button with AQ offsuit. Good hand. In tournament with 41BB stack, can open raise. Typically open to 2.5-3 BB from BTN, maybe 8-10 chips. Minimum raise is 8 (2BB). That's small but okay. Could also raise larger to isolate. Since both opponents have decent stacks (SB 247 ~ 61BB, BB 200 ~ 50BB). We want to isolate SB perhaps. But also we could just call to see flop? Not ideal.\n\nGiven AQ is strong, we should raise. Choose raise to maybe 12 (3BB) or 14 (3.5BB). Minimum raise is 8, but we can raise higher. Need to consider legal actions: raise is allowed. Choose raise to 12 (total).

Flop: Kimi checked. We have A\u2666 Q\u2665, no pair, overcards to board (Ace and Queen). No flush draw (two hearts? board has 7h, we have Qh, so we have one heart, need two more for flush).

Actually actions: seat1 posted sb 2, seat2 posted bb 4, seats 3 and 4 folded. So it's just us on button with amount to call 4 (big blind). No raise yet. So we can call 4 or raise (min raise to 8). Hand 8-7 offsuit (unsuited). In BTN, can be a decent speculative hand, but stack is 43 BB, not short. Should we raise? Consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (seat1 SB) and Kimi-K2 (seat2 BB). Actually seat1 is SB, seat2 BB. Both same name? Might be same player with two seats? Probably two different opponents with same name? Could be two separate players: seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 is Kimi-K2. Both likely similar style. We have recall of opponent raise patterns preflop: they raise to 6,6,8,6,6,8,12. So they sometimes raise small (3BB) or larger (3BB to 12). No data on calling or folding. In this hand, they have already posted blinds, not raised. So we are facing no raise, just the blinds. So we can just call (i.e., limp) or raise. With 8-7 offsuit, typical BTN open raise is fine, especially with 43 BB. Raise to maybe 12-15 (3-4 BB) to steal blinds. But we need to consider the SB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) may be tight? Not known. But typical tournament strategy: open raise with suited connectors, but 8-7 off is marginal. However being on button, you can raise to apply pressure. The BB (Kimi-K2) may defend. But also we could just call to see flop cheap and try to hit straight. However calling 4 into a 6 pot gives us 2:1 pot odds, but we have no equity preflop. Might be okay to limp? In modern NLHE, limping is rarely optimal. Better to raise for value or fold. Hand is not strong enough to call a raise later if someone 3-bets. So perhaps raise to 12 (3 BB) to isolate and potentially win blind.\n\nStack is deep enough for post-flop play. 8-7 off can make straights, but not suited, so limited flush potential. I'd raise to 12 (total). Reasoning: attempt to steal blinds, button advantage, hand decent enough for a raise.\n\nCheck legality: raise_to must be total amount. Minimum raise is 8, we can raise to 12. So action: raise, raise_to 12.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Wait board: 5h Kc As Tc. That's 5, K, A, T. No J. So we have 7-8, need 9 for straight (7-8-9-10-J?) Actually need 9 and J? Let's think: Straight possibilities with 8-7: we could have 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 6 and 9) or 7-8-9-10-J (needs 9 and J). Board has 10 but no 9, J, 6. So no immediate draw. We have two overcards to board (8 and 7 are lower than K, A, T). No pair, no flush draw (board has hearts, clubs, spades, clubs). Our suits: 8d,7s. No flush draw. So we have nothing.\n\nOpponent (Seat 2) has checked twice (flop and turn). That suggests weak hand or draw. Our stack is 162, pot 26. Turn is after opponent checked. We are on button, we have nothing. Options: check (to see river for free) or bet (raise). Since opponent checked, they likely have weak hand, maybe missed draws. We could try a bluff. However, our stack is 162, pot 26, min raise is 8. Raising to 8 (total) is a small bet. Could be effective as a \"probe\" but likely they will call with any pair (K, A, T). They have Kc? Unknown.\n\nConsider tournament: we have 40.5 BB, not huge but okay. Should we try to steal the pot? The board is fairly high: Ace, King, Ten. Opponent likely has a strong hand if they have Ace or King. But they checked, maybe they have middle pair (T) or a draw. We have nothing, so a small raise may get called and we lose more chips. Better to check and see river. Since amount to call is 0, checking is safe.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nWe need to output JSON.",

Our hand: 8-7, no pair, no straight draw (board has A K T 5 5). Our best hand is high card Ace? Actually we have 8 and 7, board Ace high, we have Ace on board, we have no pair. So we have Ace high (board Ace). Opponent (Seat 2) checked river. So they have checked. We can check or raise. What is opponent's range? Seat 2 is BB, called preflop raise of 12 (our raise). So they called 8 (since raise to 12, they called 8). So they have a hand that can call a raise of 12 preflop from BB. Likely decent hands: any pair, broadways, suited connectors maybe. Board is fairly high; they could have made pair of 5s, a straight? Board: A K T 5 5. Straight possibilities: 9-8 would give 9-8-7-6-5? Not present. Actually board includes T, K, A, 5,5. Straight combos: 9-8-7-6-5 (needs 9,8,7,6). Not possible. 8-7-6-5-4 (needs 8,7,6,4). Not possible. So no straight on board.\n\nPotential opponent's hand: maybe they have a pair (e.g., A, K, T, 5, etc). Could have Ace, King, Ten, pair of 5s (if they have a 5). Could have a set of 5s if they have 5x. Could have two pair (A K, A T, K T, etc). Could have top pair Ace with kicker etc. Could have a missed draw.\n\nGiven we have no showdown value, we are behind most of opponent's range. So checking is best. Raising is a bluff attempt; but we have no equity and board is not very dynamic. River check is fine.\n\nCheck is legal (amount to call 0). So action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Wait blinds: SB 2, BB 4, then seat4 raise 8 means they raised to 8 total? Usually raise to 8 means total 8, which is 4 more than BB. So amount to call is 8 (so they raised to 8). Minimum raise to 12 (so raise at least to 12). We have legal actions: fold, call, raise. Need decide.\n\nOur hand: Ace-5 suited clubs. Not a premium hand, but suited ace can be played in late position, especially with deep stacks (40.5 BB). However, facing a raise from CO (cutoff) (actually seat4 is CO? Wait seat5 is us, seat4 is CO? The description says our position: CO (Seat5). So seat5 is CO, we are CO. Seat4 is MP? Actually seat numbers: seat1 UTG? Not sure. But we are CO, seat5. Action: seat4 raise 8. So a player in the button? Actually seat4 is likely the button? Let's assume seat4 is the player in the button (maybe MP). Regardless, they raised from earlier position (maybe MP). They raised to 8 (2 BB). That's a standard raise. Our hand is Ace-5 suited, we could call to see flop, but with 40 BB we could also raise (3-bet) for value or isolate. But Ace-5 suited is not strong enough for a 3-bet in early position? It could be a semi-bluff, but we are out of position after the button? Actually we are CO, after them (MP) raise, we are later position (CO). So we can 3-bet for value or steal. However, 3-betting with Ace-5 suited is risky, especially against a player who may 4-bet. But we have decent stack, but risk.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: we have no data. Could recall opponent raise patterns. The tool returned none (no raise actions recorded). So unknown.\n\nPot odds: calling 8 into pot 14 = 8/(14+8)=8/22\u224836% pot odds.

Need to consider opponent tendencies: we have data on Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raising preflop amounts: 8,6,6,8,12. Those are raises from SB? Actually seat 2 is Kimi-K2. In this hand, seat 3 posted SB 2 (so seat 3 is SB), seat 4 posted BB 4 (BB). So seat 2 is not in blinds; seat 2 is left of SB? Actually seat numbers: seat 1,2,3,4,5. Seat 5 is us UTG (but UTG is seat 5? Usually UTG is left of big blind; but seat numbers may be arbitrary). Anyway, we have opponents: Kimi-K2 seats 1 and 2. Both have stacks > our stack. We have no info on their tendencies besides raise amounts. They seem to raise small amounts (6-12). Likely they are playing standard raise sizes.\n\nWe are UTG, first to act preflop after blinds posted. Amount to call is 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to total 8). So we can raise to 8 (a 4x raise? Actually big blind 4, raise to 8 is 4 more). That's a standard raise size of 2 BB (since BB is 4). That's small but typical in tournament early stage.\n\nGiven JJ, we should raise to build pot and isolate. Might consider re-raise (3-bet) if we anticipate a raise from later players? But currently no raise yet; we are first to act. So we can either raise to 8 (standard) or maybe a larger raise (e.g., 12). Our stack is 154, but early position we want to protect JJ from being outdrawn. A raise to 8 is fine.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. So we can raise to any amount >=8. Minimum raise is 8, but we could raise larger. Considering we have 38 BB, maybe raise to 12 (3 BB) to thin the field. But we have no info on opponents' aggression. Since they have raised small amounts before, they may call or 3-bet. A raise to 12 may discourage many callers. I'd likely raise to 12 (3 BB) to get value and protect. However typical standard is 2-3 BB. Since we have 38 BB, 3 BB is fine.\n\nThus action: raise to 12. Reason: JJ strong, early position, want to thin field, build pot.\n\nCheck legal: raise_to 12.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need decide action. Hand QTs suited (Queens Ten suited). Position BTN, stacks 154, blinds 2/4, effective stack 154 (38.5 BB). Opponents: seat1 SB 2 chips (tiny stack?), seat2 BB 4 chips (tiny). Actually they have small stacks (2 and 4 chips). So they are short-stacked, likely all-in or push/fold. Minimum raise is 8, which is 2 BB. With such short stacks, we can consider raising to isolate, maybe shove.\n\nWe need consider opponent tendencies: seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking with 237 chips, seat2 Kimi-K2 212 chips. But they have only 2 and 4 chips left, meaning they are short-stacked and likely will go all-in or fold. Our raise to 8 is small relative to their stacks (they have 2 and 4). Actually they have less than 8, so they cannot call a raise to 8; they'd have to go all-in for less than that? In poker, if they have less than the raise amount, they can go all-in for their remaining chips, which is a call of the raise? Typically they'd be forced to either call the bet amount (4) or go all-in for 2 or 4. Since they are SB with 2 chips, they are already all-in? Wait they posted small blind 2, they have 2 chips total, so they are all-in for the blind. Similarly BB posted 4 and has 4 total, all-in. So they are already all-in. So the pot already includes their all-ins: SB 2, BB 4, plus our call 4 if we call, plus raise. Actually the pot is 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4). The SB is all-in for 2, BB all-in for 4. So we are facing a bet of 4 (BB). So if we call, we will match 4 and get to showdown. If we raise, we would raise to at least 8, but they cannot call more than their stack, they'd be all-in for less, but they'd be already all-in. So raising would just increase pot size with no additional opponent contributions, effectively a blind steal? Might be okay to raise to steal the blinds? Actually we are the BTN, we could raise to 8 to try to win the pot immediately; but they'd be all-in already, so they'd have no option to call raise; they'd just be out. So raising is just a bluff to win the pot without showdown. But if we raise, we risk more chips (8 total) vs calling 4. Since they are all-in, they cannot fold; they are already committed. So raising just adds chips to pot with no chance of them folding, but we could raise to isolate and maybe push them out? Actually they are already all-in, so they can't fold. So raising is just a bigger investment for no extra value; we could just call and win the pot if we have best hand at showdown, or lose if they have better hand. Since they are short stacked, they likely have a wide range of hands (any two cards). QTs suited is decent but not premium. Could consider folding if we think they have stronger range? But they are all-in for 2 and 4, they could have any hand. Our equity vs random hand: QTs suited vs random is about 57%? Actually QTs suited vs random is around 57%? Let's approximate: QTs suited vs random two cards: about 55% maybe. So calling is positive expected value.\n\nStack size: we have 154, calling 4 is negligible.\n\nThus best action: call.\n\nWe need to output JSON.",

So positions: seat1 is SB? Wait SB is seat5, we posted 2. Seat1 is BB (big blind). Seat4 is presumably UTG? Actually with 5 players, order: seat1 is SB? No typical: seat1 is dealer button? Not given. But we have SB seat5, BB seat1. So seat4 is CO? Let's not worry.\n\nPreflop: we posted SB 2, BB posted 4, seat4 called 4 (so they called BB). So now it's our turn, amount to call is 2 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise total 8). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have 3c Ts, a weak hand. In SB vs BB and a caller, pot is 10 + 2 call? Actually pot currently: SB 2 + BB 4 + call 4 = 10. To call we need 2 more, making pot 12. Raise to 8 would be total 8 from us, which is extra 6 beyond call? Actually raise total 8 means we put 8 total, which is 6 more than call (2 to call + 6 raise). That would make pot 14? Let's compute: after raise to 8, pot = SB 2 + BB 4 + call 4 + raise 8 = 18? Wait we already posted 2, but raise to 8 means we add additional 6 (since we already have 2 in). So total contributions: SB 8, BB 4, other 4 = 16? Actually we contributed 8 total, but initial 2 counted, so add 6. So pot becomes 2+4+4+6 = 16. Yes.\n\nGiven hand is weak, likely fold. But we can consider potential to steal blinds? However there is a caller already (MiniMax) who called BB, so there is a live opponent in the pot. Raising with 3T is not advisable. So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: MiniMax raised preflop 8 in hand 31, maybe aggressive. But here they just called. So they might be willing to call raises. Our hand is not good.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have Js9c on button, 40 BB stack, facing raise from MiniMax-M2 (seat4) to 12 (3bb). Small blind 2, big blind 4. Pot 18 (2+4+12). We need to decide fold/call/raise. Js9c is a suited connector, decent but not premium. In tournament, 40 BB stack, button, can consider 3-bet if we think opponent is opening wide and we have fold equity. Opponent's raise size is 12 (3bb) which is standard open raise size. MiniMax-M2's raise history: only one raise recorded, amount 8 (maybe from earlier hand). Not much info. Likely a standard opener.\n\nJs9c is a decent hand for 3-bet in position if we want to isolate and potentially play post-flop. However with 40 BB, we need to be careful. 3-bet to maybe 30? Minimum raise is 20 (i.e., raise to 20 total). That would be a 5bb raise (since call 12, raise to 20). That's a modest 5bb raise, about 2.5x the original raise. That's a small 3-bet, could be a squeeze or a value raise. With Js9c, a small 3-bet may be okay to take advantage of position and potential to see flop cheap if called.\n\nAlternatively we can call 12, see flop out of position? Actually we are button, after raise we will be first to act preflop, but after flop we will be in position vs MiniMax. Calling 12 is 3bb, pot will be 30 after call (18+12). So pot odds good. Js9c has decent equity vs typical opener range (like TT+, AK, AQs, etc). But against a raise of 3bb, his range could be wide, maybe 22+, A2s+, K9s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T9s, 98s, ATo+, KJo+, QJo. Js9c is about 12% equity maybe. Might be okay to call.\n\nGiven stack 40 BB, we can also consider 3-betting to isolate and possibly steal the blinds later. But Js9c is not a premium 3-bet hand; 3-betting could be risky if opponent 4-bets all-in.\n\nI think best is to call and see flop, maintain stack, and be in position.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nCheck legal actions: call is allowed.\n\nProvide JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have board As Qh 4d. Our hand Js 9c gives us a gutshot straight draw (needs Ten) and a backdoor flush possibilities (clubs). Also we have overcards (Jack, Nine). The opponent MiniMax-M2 raised preflop to 12 (3x BB) from UTG? Actually seat 4 is likely UTG? Not sure. They are presumably a tighter player? Need to see opponent tendencies: we have some data: they bet small amounts on flop (2, 14, 6). So they might be making continuation bets, possibly with a range of top pair, overpairs, draws, etc. The current bet is 15 into pot 45, pot odds ~ 15/(45+15)=15/60=25% to call, need 25% equity. Our hand: with As Qh 4d board, we have no pair, but we have open-ended? Actually we have a gutshot: need Ten to make straight (J-10-9-8-7? Wait we have J and 9, board A Q 4. Straight possibilities: 10-J-Q-K-A? No we have J, need K and 10? Actually board: A Q 4. Our hand J9. Straight combos: 10-J-Q-K-A would need 10 and K, but we only have J; we need 10 and K? That's two cards, not possible. Another straight: 7-8-9-10-J would need 8 and 10. So we need 10 plus either 8 or K? Wait we have J9, board A Q 4. The only possible straight using our cards and board: 9-10-J-Q-K? Need 10 and K, but board doesn't have K. So we need both 10 and K on turn and river, unlikely. Also 4-5-6-7-8? No. So actually we have no straight draw. Let's think: With J9, board A Q 4, we have no pair, no draw. We have two overcards, but no made hand. So we are behind most of opponent's range (top pair Q, A, maybe a set of 4, etc). The opponent's bet 15 is a continuation bet; we have only 148 chips, 37 BB. Call 15 is ~10% of stack. Could consider a call as a cheap bluff catcher? But we have no showdown value. Could we raise as a bluff? Minimum raise to 30, would be 30 total (i.e., raise 15 more). That's 30 into pot 60 = 33% of pot. Our stack is 148, can raise. Opponent likely has a decent hand; raising might be too aggressive. Better to fold.\n\nCheck if opponent is aggressive? Past flop bets: small 2, 14, 6. That suggests they are variable but often small. This bet 15 is about 1/3 pot, typical. So folding is correct.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

But raising could be okay to try to isolate, but raise to 16 (min raise) is 2x BB, still small. Could raise to 16 (total) to apply pressure. But UTG raise may get re-raises from later positions. However, many players have stacks >200, they could 3-bet. With K7s, not a good candidate for 3-bet.

          "reasoning_content": "We have K7 suited (spades). In BB with 17.5 BB stack, facing a raise to 24 (3BB) from seat 2 (Kimi-K2). The raise is 24 total (i.e., 24 chips). The big blind is 8, so raise size is 24, which is 3x BB. Actually minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise to 40). So opponent raised to 24, we need to call 16 more to see flop. Our hand K7s is marginal. In BB, we have 17.5 BB. K7s is not a premium hand; it's a suited king, decent for stealing blinds if we have position, but here we are out of position (BB vs raise from early? Not sure seat numbers but seat 2 is UTG? Actually seat numbers: seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (folded), seat 2 is Kimi-K2, seat 3 DeepSeek-V3.2, seat 4 MiniMax-M2, seat5 us. So seat 2 is to our left (under the gun). So early position raise. Our hand K7s is weak vs early raise; we could fold. Could also call to see flop if we think we have implied odds and can hit a flush or straight. But stack is shortish; calling 16 chips adds 16 to pot, pot will be 40 (preflop) + 24 raise + 8 call? Wait pot before action: blinds 4+8 =12, plus seat2 posted sb? Actually seat2 posted sb 4? That's weird: seat2 is SB? Actually seat2 posted sb 4 (small blind), seat3 posted bb 8 (big blind). But we are seat5 BB? Wait confusion: The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". But actions show seat2 post_sb 4, seat3 post_bb 8, seat4 fold, seat5 call 8, seat1 fold, seat2 raise 24, seat3 fold. So seat5 (us) called 8 (big blind). So seat3 posted BB 8, but seat5 also called 8? That seems contradictory. Possibly the game is weird: maybe seat5 is the BB, but seat3 posted BB earlier? Actually seat3 posted bb 8, then seat5 (us) called 8 as well? That would be like we are in the cutoff? But they say our position is BB. Maybe they mis-ordered. But the pot is 40 chips (maybe includes blinds and a call). Let's trust that we are in BB and we already posted 8 (big blind). Now opponent raised to 24 (i.e., 3x). So we need to call 16 more.\n\nStack 140, we have 17.5 BB. K7s is marginal. Usually fold vs early raise unless we have good implied odds and deep stack; but stack is shallow. So likely fold.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: recall shows they often raise small amounts (6,8,10,12). This raise to 24 is larger (3BB). Might be stronger range. So folding is prudent.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

Both have decent stacks. Preflop: seat1 posted SB 4, seat2 posted BB 8. So we are on button, after SB and BB, we act. Amount to call 8 (BB). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise by at least 8 more). Hand Q2 suited spades, very weak. With short stack, maybe consider shove? But we have 17.5 BB, can push all-in for 140 chips. However, raising to 16 is small relative to stack. Should we fold? Q2 suited is very weak, but we could steal blinds. With 17.5 BB, pushing all-in might be okay if we think opponents will fold. However, they are early position? Actually they are SB and BB, they have already posted. SB is seat1, BB seat2. Both have larger stacks. Their tendencies: recall shows Kimi-K2 Thinking raises preflop amounts 6,12,30,6,14. Those are raises relative to blinds? Likely these are raise amounts (maybe total bet?). Hard to interpret. But they have raised preflop before. Might be aggressive.\n\nGiven our stack, we could either call (i.e., just match BB) but that would be a limp, not typical with short stack. Could raise to 16 (small raise) then maybe get re-raised. Better to either fold or go all-in. Q2 suited is not a steal candidate; typical push range from button with 17 BB might include any two cards? Actually typical push range is quite wide, but Q2 suited is maybe okay? In tournament, with 17 BB, push/fold strategy suggests you can push with any hand that is at least as good as 12% of combos? Q2 suited maybe borderline. But given opponents have shown willingness to raise preflop, they may call or re-raise. Might be too risky.\n\nThus likely fold.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #49, preflop BB with 7s Kc. Stack 128 (16 BB). Blinds 4/8, posted SB 4, BB posted 8. So we are out of position vs seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) who posted BB? Actually seat1 is BB? Wait seat1 posted bb 8. So seat1 is the other player (only other active). So it's heads-up (only two players). We are BB, seat1 is the button? Actually seat1 is after us? Let's see order: Seat5 (us) is BB, seat1 is SB? Wait the blind posting: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4 (so seat5 is SB). But earlier says our position BB seat5. In actions: Seat5 post_sb 4, Seat1 post_bb 8. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But the description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". That conflicts. The actions show seat5 posted SB, seat1 posted BB. Possibly the description mislabels. But we have to trust the actions: seat5 (us) posted SB 4, seat1 posted BB 8. So we are SB with 7s Kc, stack 128 (16BB). Amount to call is 4 (to call BB 8? Actually we posted SB 4, now need to call 8? Wait we already posted SB 4, the BB is 8, so to call we need to put additional 4 to match BB 8). Yes amount to call 4. Minimum raise to 16 (total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nSo we are SB with K7 offsuit (7s Kc). In heads-up, K7 suited? Actually 7s Kc is offsuit (spade 7, club K). In heads-up, K7 off is decent but not premium. Stack 16BB, we are shortish. Opponent seat1's tendencies: from recall, they have raised preflop once (hand 46 raise 24). Also they have bet on flop (hand 39 bet 8, hand44 bet 12). They have also check-call patterns. Overall they seem to be somewhat aggressive (raise 24 preflop). But not sure about range.\n\nWe need to decide: call, raise, or fold. With K7 off, in heads-up short stack, calling is okay to see flop cheap. Raising to 16 (total) would be 8 more after call? Actually raise to total 16 means we put 16 total, which is 8 more than call amount (since we already have 4 posted). That would be a raise of 8 (to 16). Minimum raise is 16 total, which is 8 over call? Wait call amount is 4 (to match BB 8). To raise to 16 total, we need to put total 16, which is 12 more than our current 4 (since we already posted 4). So raise amount = 12 (makes pot 4+8+12=24). That's a raise of 8 over call? Actually call would be 4 more to reach 8. So raise to 16 is +8 beyond call? Wait compute: we have 4 posted, opponent has 8 posted. To call, we need to add 4 (total 8). To raise to 16 total, we need to add 12 (total 16). So raise amount is 12, which is 8 over call. That seems okay.\n\nGiven stack 16BB, raising may isolate and maybe we can go all-in later. But K7 off is not strong enough to raise for value; but could be a steal? In heads-up, SB raising can be good but opponent is BB, likely to defend. Opponent's BB may be aggressive (raised preflop before). But we have no read that they raise often. Might be okay to call and see flop.\n\nPot odds: current pot 12 (SB+BB). If we call 4, pot becomes 16. Effective stack after call: opponent has 128-8=120, we have 124 left after call? Actually we have 128-8 (SB+call) = 120 left. So pot odds fine.\n\nGiven K7 off, I'd call.\n\nThus output JSON with action call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are in SB with 7s Kc, stack 128, effective stack 128 (others have more). The amount to call is 4 (to match BB 8? Actually SB posted 4, BB posted 8, so we need to call 4 more to match BB). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total bet 16). So we can fold, call 4, or raise to at least 16.\n\nWe have 7\u2660 K\u2663. In SB vs BB heads-up, typical strategy: raise with a wide range, but with 16 BB stack, we could consider a raise to steal BB. 7K offsuit is decent, but not premium. However, we have 16 BB, and BB is Kimi-K2. We have some data: opponent's raise amounts vary; they sometimes raise 6,8,10,12,24. They seem to raise larger amounts sometimes. In this situation, we are SB, they are BB. They posted 8, we can raise to 16 (total). That would be a 12 raise (8+? Actually to 16 total). That's a 2x BB raise. Could be a standard raise.\n\nBut we need to consider stack depth: 16 BB, we could also shove. 7K offsuit is not a good all-in hand. So better to raise to 16 and see flop. But also consider that BB may re-raise all-in. With 7K off, not great against re-raise. But calling 4 is cheap, see flop cheap. However, if we call, we will be out of position after flop (SB vs BB, BB is in position). Actually after flop, action starts with SB first (since BB posted last). So SB acts first. So calling gives us position on flop? In heads-up, after flop, SB acts first (since they are \"under the gun\"). So we would be out of position (act first). That's disadvantage.\n\nRaising can gain initiative and maybe win pot preflop. 7K offsuit is a decent raise in SB vs BB. So raise to 16 seems good.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 16.

Then BB raised to 16 (so effectively 8 raise). Seat1 called 8 (so now pot: initial 4+8 + raise 8? Actually preflop pot: SB 4, BB 8, then BB raise to 16 (adds extra 8), seat1 call 8 => total contributions: SB 4, BB 16, seat1 16? Wait seat1 call 8 means they call the raise amount of 8 extra? Actually they called the raise of 8, so they put 8+? They already posted 4? No seat1 is in SB? Wait seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking - they posted SB 4, then they are seat1? Actually seat numbers: seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 is Kimi-K2, seat3 DeepSeek, seat4 MiniMax, seat5 GPT-OSS. The blinds: SB is seat? Usually seat left of dealer posts SB, then BB. Not sure. But actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB? Wait our position is BB (Seat5) according to hand description. But actions say seat5 posted sb. Contradiction. Maybe seat numbers shifted; but description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So seat5 is BB, but actions say seat5 posted sb 4. Might be error. Anyway we raised preflop to 16, and seat1 called. So we are the aggressor, now flop.\n\nFlop: 2h Jc Tc. Board gives straight draw possibilities. Our hand: 7s Kc. We have gutshot? Board: 2-10-J. Our K gives us top pair? Actually we have Kc, board has Jc, Tc, 2h. No King on board, so we have overpair? No, we have K high, but board has J and T, so K is higher than both, but not a pair. So we have \"King high\" with a backdoor straight draw? 7 can make straight with 8-9? Not relevant. So we have nothing. Opponent (seat1) called preflop raise, likely has a range: could be broadway combos, maybe J,T, Q, K, A, etc. Flop is Jc Tc 2h. This is a very good flop for many hands: any J, any T, any Q (open-ended straight draw), any K (top pair), any A (gutshot? Actually A with K? Not). Also any pair of 2. Our Kc is top pair? No, we have K, not pair. So we have just a King high, not a made hand. We are out of position (since we raised preflop, but flop action order: who acts first? Usually the player left of the button (SB) acts first preflop, but after flop, the first active player to the left of the dealer acts. Dealer is seat? Not given. But we are BB, which is usually after SB. The flop action: Since we raised preflop, we are the preflop aggressor, but on flop, the SB (if still in) would act first, then BB, then others. However SB folded preflop? Actually seat5 posted sb, we are seat5, but we raised preflop, so we are the raiser. The other player (seat1) is BB, who called. So on flop, the action starts with the player left of the button (SB) which is us? Actually if we are SB and we raised, we are first to act preflop.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB (seat5) with 7s Kc. Stack 116 chips, 14.5 BB. Blinds 4/8. Preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8. Then BB raised to 16 (so effectively 8 raise). Seat1 called 8 (so now pot: initial 4+8 + raise 8? Actually preflop pot: SB 4, BB 8, then BB raise to 16 (adds extra 8), seat1 call 8 => total contributions: SB 4, BB 16, seat1 16? Wait seat1 call 8 means they call the raise amount of 8 extra? Actually they called the raise of 8, so they put 8+? They already posted 4? No seat1 is in SB? Wait seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking - they posted SB 4, then they are seat1? Actually seat numbers: seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 is Kimi-K2, seat3 DeepSeek, seat4 MiniMax, seat5 GPT-OSS. The blinds: SB is seat? Usually seat left of dealer posts SB, then BB. Not sure. But actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB? Wait our position is BB (Seat5) according to hand description. But actions say seat5 posted sb. Contradiction. Maybe seat numbers shifted; but description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So seat5 is BB, but actions say seat5 posted sb 4. Might be error. Anyway we raised preflop to 16, and seat1 called. So we are the aggressor, now flop.\n\nFlop: 2h Jc Tc. Board gives straight draw possibilities. Our hand: 7s Kc. We have gutshot? Board: 2-10-J. Our K gives us top pair? Actually we have Kc, board has Jc, Tc, 2h. No King on board, so we have overpair? No, we have K high, but board has J and T, so K is higher than both, but not a pair. So we have \"King high\" with a backdoor straight draw? 7 can make straight with 8-9? Not relevant. So we have nothing. Opponent (seat1) called preflop raise, likely has a range: could be broadway combos, maybe J,T, Q, K, A, etc. Flop is Jc Tc 2h. This is a very good flop for many hands: any J, any T, any Q (open-ended straight draw), any K (top pair), any A (gutshot? Actually A with K? Not). Also any pair of 2. Our Kc is top pair? No, we have K, not pair. So we have just a King high, not a made hand. We are out of position (since we raised preflop, but flop action order: who acts first? Usually the player left of the button (SB) acts first preflop, but after flop, the first active player to the left of the dealer acts. Dealer is seat? Not given. But we are BB, which is usually after SB. The flop action: Since we raised preflop, we are the preflop aggressor, but on flop, the SB (if still in) would act first, then BB, then others. However SB folded preflop? Actually seat5 posted sb, we are seat5, but we raised preflop, so we are the raiser. The other player (seat1) is BB, who called. So on flop, the action starts with the player left of the button (SB) which is us? Actually if we are SB and we raised, we are first to act preflop. On flop, the first to act is the player left of the button (SB) which is us. So we act first on flop. That matches \"Amount to call: 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise\". So we can check or raise.\n\nWe have a weak hand. Should we check and possibly fold to a bet? Or we could try a continuation bet (c-bet) to represent strength. Our stack is 116, pot 32.

To make straight we need Q and 9? No. Straight combos: 9-8-? Not. Let's enumerate: With K, need Q and 9? Actually K-J-10 forms K-J-10? That's not a straight. Need Q and 9 to make 9-10-J-Q-K. We have K, need Q and 9. No 9 on board. So we have gutshot to a straight (needs Q and 9). Also we have two overcards (K) and a gutshot.\n\nWe are in BB, stack 116, pot 52, opponent bet 20. Opponent is Kimi-K2 (seat1) with 231 chips, likely UTG? Actually seat1 is small blind? Wait position: seat1 is SB? The blinds: SB seat5? Actually they posted sb 4 (seat5), bb 8 (seat1). So seat1 is BB? Wait seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So seat5 is SB (we are BB? Actually description says Position: BB (Seat5). But they posted sb 4. Inconsistent. The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". But actions show seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So maybe the roles swapped: seat5 is SB but they call it BB. Anyway we are the small blind? Actually seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So seat5 is SB. But they say BB. We'll ignore.\n\nWe have 116 chips left after posting sb 4? Actually stack includes posted sb? Usually stack after posting is remaining. So we have 116 chips left (including sb posted? Usually stack after posting is net). So effective stack is 116.\n\nOpponent bet 20 into pot 52, so pot after bet = 72 (including bet). To call 20, pot odds: 20/(52+20)=20/72\u224827.8% needed to break even. Our hand equity: we have gutshot (2 outs? Actually need Q and 9. That's 2 outs each 4 suits = 8 outs. Also we have K which is top pair? No board doesn't have K. So we have 8 outs. Plus maybe we have backdoor flush draws? We have 7s, board has 2h, Jc, Tc. No spades on board, so we have 7s as one spade, could get flush draw if turn and river spades. That's 12 spades left? Actually spades: 13 total, 1 in our hand, none on board, so 12 spades left, but need two spades to complete flush, so probability lower. But main equity ~8 outs => ~18% on flop turn+river? Actually after turn, probability to hit by river ~ 15%? On flop, chance to hit by river = 1 - (44/47)*(43/46) \u2248 1 - 0.936*0.935 = 1 - 0.874 = 0.126. So ~12.6% for straight. Add flush possibilities maybe ~6%? So total maybe ~18-20% equity.\n\nPot odds 27.8% > equity, so call is negative expected value. However we could consider raise to bluff? Opponent bet 20, we could raise to 40 (minimum raise) to represent strong hand. But our stack is 116, we could raise to 40, opponent might fold? Opponent's tendencies unknown. We can recall opponent's flop betting patterns. We attempted recall but none found. So unknown.\n\nGiven we are short stack (14.5 BB). We may want to preserve chips. Our hand is weak.

We can raise to isolate or to build pot.\n\nStack is 116, we have 14.5 BB. Raising to 16 (minimum) would be about 2 BB raise (since big blind 8). That's modest. Could also raise bigger, maybe 3-4 BB (24-32) to pressure. However we need to consider we have only 14.5 BB; raising too high could commit us.\n\nGiven we have suited KJ, decent equity vs multiple opponents. With 3 players in pot, raising may thin field. So I think raise to 24 (3 BB) would be good: it's 24 total, which is 3 BB (since 8 BB). Actually 24 total is 3*8 = 24, so raise to 24 (i.e., raise by 16 more).

Action: we raised to 24 (3xBB) after small blind posted 4 and big blind posted 8, and MiniMax called 8 (so pot 4+8+8+24=44? Wait compute: SB 4, BB 8, MiniMax call 8, we raise to 24 (so we put 24). Then Seat1 folds, Seat2 (big blind) raises to 60 (so they added 52 more? Actually they raise to 60 total, meaning they put 60 chips total). So now we need to call 36 more to match 60 (since we already have 24 in). Minimum raise to 96 (i.e., raise at least to 96 total). Our stack is 92, so we cannot raise to 96; we could go all-in for 92 total (i.e., raise to 92). That would be an all-in raise, which is allowed if raise is legal? The legal actions: fold, call, raise. Since we cannot meet minimum raise, we can go all-in as a raise? Usually if you cannot raise to the minimum, you can go all-in but it's considered a call? In many rules, you cannot raise less than minimum unless it's all-in. So we could either call 36 (leaving us 56 chips left) or go all-in for 92 (i.e., raise to 92). Decision: Js Ks is a strong hand, especially in short stack situation, but we are out of position after the raise. The opponent (Seat2) is Kimi-K2 with 164 chips, about 20 BB. They raised to 60 (3.75 BB) after our raise. That's a sizable raise. With JsKs, we have decent equity but not a premium hand. In short stack tournament, we could consider shoving all-in to try to double up, but risk being called by a stronger hand (e.g., AK, AQ, TT+, etc.). Our stack 92, we are 11.5 BB, we are short. The pot currently is 96 chips (including our 24, their 60, blinds). If we call, we will have 56 left, still short. Might be okay to call and see flop? But with such short stack, playing post-flop is risky. Better to go all-in to maximize fold equity. Opponent may have a wide range? They are the BB, maybe defending. They raised after our raise; could be a 3-bet with strong hand. Their stack 164, they could be looking to pressure short stacks. I think shoving all-in is reasonable.\n\nThus action: raise to 92 (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, strong hand, want to apply pressure, cannot meet min raise, so go all-in.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action. Situation: we are BTN with JsKs (Jack suited King). Stack 20 chips (2.5 BB). Wait stack is 20 chips, but blinds are 4/8, so big blind is 8, small blind 4. Our stack 20 means we have 2.5 BB total. Pot currently 272 chips? That seems huge relative to stacks. Something off: The pot is 272 chips, but players have low stacks. Probably previous pot from earlier hands? But anyway.\n\nPreflop actions: Seat1 posted small blind 4 (but they folded later). Seat2 posted big blind 8. Seat3 folded, Seat4 called 8 (so they put 8 in). Seat5 (us) raise 24 (so we raised to 24 total? That's 3x BB). Then Seat1 fold, Seat2 raise 60 (so they re-raise to 60). Seat4 fold, Seat5 raise 96 (we re-raise to 96). Then Seat2 raise 164 (they 3-bet? Actually they 4-bet). So now amount to call is 68 (since they raised to 164, we have put 96, need 68 more). Minimum raise to 232. Legal actions: fold, call. So we cannot raise because we don't have enough chips? Our stack is 20 chips total, but we have already put 96? Something inconsistent. Maybe chip counts are not actual; perhaps the stack numbers are in chips but the pot is huge due to tournament? Actually we have 20 chips left, but we already put 96? That can't be. So maybe the stack numbers are relative to something else. Perhaps the stack numbers are in big blinds? No. Something is off.\n\nNevertheless, the legal actions are fold or call. So we can call 68 more chips, which would bring our total investment to 164, which likely exceeds our stack? But we have 20 chips only. Something contradictory. Probably the stack numbers are not accurate; maybe our stack is 200 chips? But they say 20 chips (2.5 BB). That would be 20 chips total, but we have already invested 96, which is impossible. So maybe the pot is in some other unit. Regardless, the system says we can only fold or call.\n\nWe have JsKs, a decent hand, but deep in a short stack. The effective stack after opponent's 164 raise likely leaves us with maybe 20 left? Actually we have 20 chips total; we have already contributed 96, leaving -? So maybe the numbers are misaligned but the decision is forced: we can either call or fold. Since we have a strong hand (broadway suited) and short stack, we likely should call (or go all-in). But we cannot raise.\n\nGiven short stack, we should call and be all-in. So choose call.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 5s 6h (suited connectors but not suited to each other)\n**Position:** UTG (worst position)\n**Stack:** 243 chips (60.8 BB) - decent stack\n**Blinds:** 2/4\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Very tight player. 7 folds out of 10 actions, only raised once. Seems to play very selectively.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Mixed player. Has shown aggression with raises, but also folds frequently. They posted SB this hand.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Very tight player. Folded 9 out of 10 times preflop. Only called once then folded.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:** 56o from UTG is a very weak hand. I should almost always fold this from early position. \n- No pair, no high cards\n- Not suited\n- Low connectors that rarely make strong hands\n- From UTG, I have 7 players left to act behind me\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** \n- I have a healthy stack (60.8 BB)\n- No need to take risks with marginal hands\n- Early position requires premium hands\n- The players behind me include tight players who will likely fold unless they have strong hands, but I can't rely on that\n\n**Pot odds:** Need to call 4 chips to win 6 chips = 1.5:1. This is not enough to justify playing this weak hand.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an easy fold. 56o from UTG is not a playable hand, especially with a healthy stack. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

The ace is good, but the 6 kicker is weak. This hand plays better as a call in position rather than out of position.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the recall data, Kimi-K2 has:\n- Mostly folded preflop (7 out of 10 actions were folds)\n- One raise action in hand #22 (raised to 8)\n- No showdowns recorded\nThis suggests Kimi-K2 is playing tight, so their raising range is likely strong.\n\n**Position consideration:**\nI'm in the SB, which is the worst position postflop. I'll have to act first on every street, making it difficult to realize equity and control the pot.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 18 chips\n- To call: 10 chips\n- Pot odds: 10/(18+10) = 10/28 \u2248 35.7%\nI need ~36% equity to call. Against a tight raising range from a tight player, A6o likely has less than 36% equity.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- My stack: 193 chips (48.2 BB)\n- Opponent stack: 186 chips (46.5 BB)\n- If I call, pot will be 28 chips preflop, which is ~15% of my stack. This commits me somewhat but not completely.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have an average stack (48 BB). There's no need to take marginal spots out of position against a tight player.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n1. Fold - Preserve chips, avoid playing marginal hand OOP\n2. Call - See flop with ace-high, but likely dominated\n3. Raise - Could 3-bet bluff, but A6o is not a good candidate and we have no fold equity read\n\nGiven Kimi-K2's tight tendencies and my poor position, folding is the correct play. A6o doesn't have enough equity against a tight raising range, and playing OOP with a weak ace is a recipe for losing chips.\n\nI should wait for better spots in better position.",

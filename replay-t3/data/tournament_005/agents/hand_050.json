It's suited, which gives some potential, but the kicker is terrible. In the SB, this is typically a fold.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB, which is one of the worst positions. I'll be first to act postflop.\n\n3. **Opponent action**: \n   - Seat 4 called the BB (8 chips)\n   - Seat 5 raised to 24 (3x the BB)\n   - I need to call 20 more chips\n\n4. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is currently 44 chips\n   - I need to call 20 chips\n   - Pot odds: 44:20 or 2.2:1\n   - This means I need ~31% equity to call\n\n5. **Stack sizes**:\n   - I have 279 chips (34.9 BB)\n   - Seat 5 (raiser) has 92 chips (11.5 BB) - relatively short stack\n   - Seat 4 (caller) has 172 chips (21.5 BB)\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I have a healthy stack (34.9 BB)\n   - The raiser is relatively short-stacked\n   - I should be selective with my hands, especially out of position\n\nAgainst typical raising ranges, Q4s doesn't have enough equity to call here, even with the suitedness. The kicker is just too weak. I should fold this hand and preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nI don't have specific opponent history, but the default play here is to fold this weak hand from the SB facing a raise.\n\nDecision: Fold",

The blinds are 4/8, and I need to call 8 to see the flop. \n\nLooking at my recent hand history, I've been folding a lot from UTG (hands 40 and 45). I have a 22% win rate overall, and I've been playing quite tight.\n\nFrom the opponent actions, I see:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) raised to 24 in hand 46 from SB position\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) raised to 16 in hand 49\n- Most opponents have been folding preflop\n\nA7o is a marginal hand, especially from UTG. The Ace is good, but the 7 kicker is weak. With 5 players left to act behind me (including the blinds), this hand is likely not strong enough to open with.\n\nIn tournament poker, position matters a lot. Being UTG means I'll be out of position for the entire hand if I continue. A7o doesn't play well postflop, especially out of position.\n\nConsidering my stack size (24.6 BB), I should be looking for better spots. Folding here preserves my stack for stronger hands in better positions.\n\nThe pot odds are: calling 8 to win 12 (pot is 12), so I need ~40% equity. Against random hands, A7o has about 40-45% equity, but against the ranges of players who might call or raise behind me, my equity is likely lower.\n\nGiven my tight image and the fact that I've been folding marginal hands from UTG, continuing with this hand would be a deviation from my strategy without a good reason.\n\nI should fold.",

Let me break down my decision:\n\n**Hand Analysis**: Pocket 4s is a medium-strength pocket pair that can improve to a set on the flop, which would be very strong.\n\n**Position Considerations**: UTG is early position, so I need to be selective, but pocket pairs remain playable from this position.\n\n**Pot Odds**: The pot is 12 chips and I need to call 8 chips, giving me 1.5:1 odds. This is marginal for set mining but still playable given my stack size.\n\n**My History**: I've been playing tight (12.2% win rate, mostly folding), so this is a reasonable spot to continue that pattern with a playable hand.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**: Looking at Seat 1's history, they've been active with raises and bets, while Seat 2 has been very passive.\n\nWith 22.5 BB, I can afford to call 8 chips to see the flop and potentially hit a set. If I miss, I can reassess on later streets.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 4s is a playable hand from UTG with decent set-mining potential.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation more carefully:\n\n1. **My Hand**: Pocket 4s (44) in UTG position\n2. **Stack**: 180 chips (22.5 BB) \n3. **Position**: UTG (Seat 4) - early position\n4. **Pot**: 12 chips (blinds already posted)\n5. **Amount to call**: 8 chips\n6. **Legal actions**: fold, call, raise\n\nFrom the memory tools:\n- I've been playing tight, folding most hands (43 folds out of 49 hands played, 12.2% win rate)\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been active with raises and bets, showed down with 44s in hand #36 but lost\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been very passive, folding most hands\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n**Position Factor**: UTG is early position, which means I need to be more selective. Pocket pairs are still playable from UTG though.\n\n**Hand Strength**: 44s is a medium-strength pocket pair. It can make a set (about 12% chance on the flop) which would be very strong.\n\n**Stack Considerations**: With 22.5 BB, I have enough chips to call and set-mine. I'm not short-stacked yet.\n\n**Pot Odds**: The pot is 12 chips and I need to call 8 chips. This gives me 12:8 = 1.5:1 pot odds. For set mining, I generally want at least 2:1 or better odds, so this is marginal but still playable.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**: \n- Seat 1 has been active and aggressive\n- Seat 2 has been very passive (lots of folds)\n- Players behind me have varying stack sizes\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: I'm at 22.5 BB, so I need to be somewhat careful but can still play pocket pairs for set value.\n\nGiven that:\n\n\nI see a nuanced scenario with my pocket 4s. The hand offers moderate potential, especially with the possibility of hitting a set. While the pot odds aren't ideal, they're just acceptable for a tight player in an early position. The low stack size and potential for a significant payoff make calling a reasonable strategic move, despite the marginal odds.\n",

This suggests they are aggressive and may raise with a range. The current situation: they have already called (MiniMax-M2 called 8). So they are not raising now. We can raise to isolate or to build pot.\n\nStack is 116, we have 14.5 BB. Raising to 16 (minimum) would be about 2 BB raise (since big blind 8). That's modest. Could also raise bigger, maybe 3-4 BB (24-32) to pressure. However we need to consider we have only 14.5 BB; raising too high could commit us.\n\nGiven we have suited KJ, decent equity vs multiple opponents. With 3 players in pot, raising may thin field. So I think raise to 24 (3 BB) would be good: it's 24 total, which is 3 BB (since 8 BB). Actually 24 total is 3*8 = 24, so raise to 24 (i.e., raise by 16 more). Minimum raise to 16, we can raise to 24. That is a 3x BB raise.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed. So we will raise to 24.\n\nReasoning: strong hand, position, want to isolate, opponents are aggressive so they may fold to raise. Also we have decent stack.\n\nThus output JSON.",

Then Seat1 folds, Seat2 (big blind) raises to 60 (so they added 52 more? Actually they raise to 60 total, meaning they put 60 chips total). So now we need to call 36 more to match 60 (since we already have 24 in). Minimum raise to 96 (i.e., raise at least to 96 total).

The legal actions: fold, call, raise. Since we cannot meet minimum raise, we can go all-in as a raise? Usually if you cannot raise to the minimum, you can go all-in but it's considered a call? In many rules, you cannot raise less than minimum unless it's all-in. So we could either call 36 (leaving us 56 chips left) or go all-in for 92 (i.e., raise to 92). Decision: Js Ks is a strong hand, especially in short stack situation, but we are out of position after the raise. The opponent (Seat2) is Kimi-K2 with 164 chips, about 20 BB. They raised to 60 (3.75 BB) after our raise. That's a sizable raise. With JsKs, we have decent equity but not a premium hand. In short stack tournament, we could consider shoving all-in to try to double up, but risk being called by a stronger hand (e.g., AK, AQ, TT+, etc.). Our stack 92, we are 11.5 BB, we are short. The pot currently is 96 chips (including our 24, their 60, blinds). If we call, we will have 56 left, still short. Might be okay to call and see flop? But with such short stack, playing post-flop is risky. Better to go all-in to maximize fold equity. Opponent may have a wide range? They are the BB, maybe defending. They raised after our raise; could be a 3-bet with strong hand. Their stack 164, they could be looking to pressure short stacks. I think shoving all-in is reasonable.\n\nThus action: raise to 92 (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, strong hand, want to apply pressure, cannot meet min raise, so go all-in.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Wait stack is 20 chips, but blinds are 4/8, so big blind is 8, small blind 4. Our stack 20 means we have 2.5 BB total. Pot currently 272 chips? That seems huge relative to stacks. Something off: The pot is 272 chips, but players have low stacks. Probably previous pot from earlier hands? But anyway.\n\nPreflop actions: Seat1 posted small blind 4 (but they folded later). Seat2 posted big blind 8. Seat3 folded, Seat4 called 8 (so they put 8 in). Seat5 (us) raise 24 (so we raised to 24 total? That's 3x BB). Then Seat1 fold, Seat2 raise 60 (so they re-raise to 60). Seat4 fold, Seat5 raise 96 (we re-raise to 96). Then Seat2 raise 164 (they 3-bet? Actually they 4-bet). So now amount to call is 68 (since they raised to 164, we have put 96, need 68 more). Minimum raise to 232. Legal actions: fold, call. So we cannot raise because we don't have enough chips? Our stack is 20 chips total, but we have already put 96? Something inconsistent. Maybe chip counts are not actual; perhaps the stack numbers are in chips but the pot is huge due to tournament? Actually we have 20 chips left, but we already put 96? That can't be. So maybe the stack numbers are relative to something else. Perhaps the stack numbers are in big blinds? No. Something is off.\n\nNevertheless, the legal actions are fold or call. So we can call 68 more chips, which would bring our total investment to 164, which likely exceeds our stack? But we have 20 chips only. Something contradictory. Probably the stack numbers are not accurate; maybe our stack is 200 chips? But they say 20 chips (2.5 BB). That would be 20 chips total, but we have already invested 96, which is impossible. So maybe the pot is in some other unit. Regardless, the system says we can only fold or call.\n\nWe have JsKs, a decent hand, but deep in a short stack. The effective stack after opponent's 164 raise likely leaves us with maybe 20 left? Actually we have 20 chips total; we have already contributed 96, leaving -? So maybe the numbers are misaligned but the decision is forced: we can either call or fold. Since we have a strong hand (broadway suited) and short stack, we likely should call (or go all-in). But we cannot raise.\n\nGiven short stack, we should call and be all-in. So choose call.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

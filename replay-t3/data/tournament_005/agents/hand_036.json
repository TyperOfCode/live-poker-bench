            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with pocket 4s (44)\n- Stack: 237 chips (59.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- To call: 4 chips\n- Legal: fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponent tendencies from recall:**\n- Seat 2 (SB - Kimi-K2): Very tight/passive. Has folded preflop many times, only checked in one hand (hand 30) and folded on flop. Showed down Ts6s in hand 30 which is a weak hand. Seems to play very few hands.\n- Seat 3 (BB - DeepSeek-V3.2): Also tight but occasionally raises. Has folded many times preflop but raised to 12 in hand 28 and 14 in hand 34. Showed down As2d in hand 21.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- Pocket 4s is a decent but not strong hand\n- On the button, this is a good position to see a flop\n- I'm getting good odds to call (4 to win 6, or 1.5:1)\n- If I raise, I might fold out the SB who is very tight\n- The BB has shown they can raise, so there's some risk\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- I'm relatively deep stacked at 59 BB\n- The SB is very tight and likely to fold to pressure\n- The BB is also tight but capable of raising\n- Pocket pairs like 4s want to see cheap flops to hit sets\n- Raising might isolate me against stronger hands\n- Calling gives me good implied odds if I hit a set\n\n**Decision:** I should call. Pocket 4s plays well in position on the button. The call is cheap (4 chips), and I have good implied odds if I hit my set. Both opponents seem tight, so I'm unlikely to face aggression unless they have strong hands. Raising would be overplaying this hand and could fold out worse hands while getting called/raised by better ones.\n\nLet me make the call.",

Check - Take a free card, hope to hit a 4 (2 outs, ~4.5% chance)\n2. Bet - Try to steal the pot, but risk getting called/raised by better hands\n3. Fold - Not an option since I can check for free\n\n**Analysis:**\n- My hand is very weak against this board\n- I have only 2 outs (the remaining two 4s) to improve\n- The Ace on board is scary and likely hits my opponent's range\n- My opponent is tight and checked, which suggests some weakness but could also be a trap\n- Checking is free and lets me see the turn card\n- If I bet, I might steal the pot sometimes, but risk being called by any Ace, Jack, or better pair\n- Given my opponent's tight nature, they likely have some piece of this board or would have folded preflop\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check here. The risk/reward of betting isn't good:\n- I have very little equity (only 2 outs)\n- The board is scary with an Ace\n- My opponent is tight and could easily have an Ace\n- I can check for free and see the turn card\n- If I hit a 4 on the turn, I might have a well-disguised set\n\nChecking preserves my stack and gives me a free chance to hit my 2-outer.

I can check or raise.\n\n**Hand analysis**: I have pocket fours on a board with J-A-8-9. This is a very wet board with straight draws (Q-T, T-7) and potential flush draws (diamonds). My fours are very weak here. I have no pair (the board has overcards), no draw, and only two outs to improve to a set on the river.\n\n**Opponent analysis**: DeepSeek-V3.2 has been quite tight based on their recent actions. Looking at the data:\n- They've folded preflop many times (hands 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35)\n- They've raised preflop a few times (hands 23, 28, 34)\n- In hand 21, they checked down all streets\n- In hand 23, they raised preflop and bet on the flop\n\nThis suggests they're a relatively tight player who doesn't get to showdown often and tends to fold when they don't have strong hands.\n\n**Action**: The opponent has checked to me on the turn. This could mean:\n1. They have a weak hand and want to see a free river\n2. They have a marginal hand and are pot-controlling\n3. They have a strong hand and are trying to trap\n\nGiven the wet board (J-A-8-9 with two diamonds), if they had a strong hand like top pair, two pair, or a straight, they would likely be betting for value and protection.\n\n**My decision**: I have absolutely nothing with my pocket fours. \n\nI see two potential paths forward. Checking allows me to see the river without risking additional chips, which seems prudent given my weak hand. The pot is currently small, and I have no compelling reason to inflate it with such a marginal holding. \n\nA bluff could potentially work against this tight opponent, but the risk seems unnecessary. I'll conserve my chips and check through to the river, hoping for a miracle four to improve my hand.",

            "reasoning_content": "  The hand has reached the river with a board of Jd As 8h 9d 5h. I have pocket 4s (4s 4h), which is a weak hand on this board. Let me analyze:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have pocket 4s. The board shows Jd As 8h 9d 5h. I have no pair, no draw, and no real hand. My best hand is Ace-high, but that's not strong given the action.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position, but that doesn't matter much when I have no hand.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: The pot is 10 chips and I can check for free. There would need to be a very compelling reason to bet here.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's actions, they've been very passive - lots of folding and checking. They've only raised a few times preflop (hands 23, 28, 34) but then didn't show much aggression postflop. In hand 23, they raised preflop to 8 and bet 8 on the flop, but in hand 34 they raised to 14 preflop. They seem to be playing a tight, passive style.\n\n5. **The action**: Everyone checked on every street. This suggests weakness from all players. DeepSeek-V3.2 checked the river, giving me the option to check or bet.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 233 chips (58.2 BB), I have a healthy stack. Betting here would be a pure bluff. Given that everyone has shown weakness by checking through, a small bluff might work, but it's risky with no equity.\n\n7. **Bluffing opportunity**: Since everyone has checked through, I could represent a strong hand with a small bet. However, DeepSeek-V3.2 has shown they can call or raise preflop with decent hands. The board is somewhat connected (J-8-9-5 with an Ace) which could hit many hands.\n\nGiven that I have absolutely no hand (just 44 on a board with an Ace, Jack, 9, 8, 5), and all the checking suggests weakness, I have two options:\n\n\nI'll take the conservative approach and check. With no hand and multiple opponents showing weakness, checking minimizes risk. While a bluff might seem tempting, the lack of any real hand strength makes it too dangerous. Checking allows me to see the showdown without investing more chips, which is the most prudent move in this tournament situation.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with 22. The SB folded, and UTG (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) just limped in (called the BB). The pot is 10 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 4 limp). I have 195 chips (48.8 BB). My options are fold, check, or raise.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has folded 9 out of 10 recent actions, with only one raise in hand #26 preflop. They seem fairly tight/passive. They just limped UTG, which suggests a weak to medium hand.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 2s is a small pocket pair. In heads-up situation from BB vs UTG limper, this is a decent spot. Small pocket pairs have good implied odds if we hit a set (about 1 in 8.5 chance). However, we're out of position which is a disadvantage.\n\nStack sizes: I have 195 chips (48.8 BB), opponent has 233 chips (58.3 BB). Pot is 10 chips.\n\nIf I check, I see a flop for free. If I raise, I can try to take the pot down preflop or build a bigger pot for when I hit a set. A standard raise would be to 12-16 chips (3-4x BB).\n\nGiven the opponent's tight tendencies (lots of folds), a raise might get them to fold, winning the 10-chip pot immediately. Even if they call, I have position disadvantage but decent implied odds if I hit a set.\n\nHowever, raising with 22 out of position against a limper can be tricky. If I get called, I'll be playing a small pair out of position on most flops that don't contain a 2.\n\nLet me consider tournament dynamics: I have 48.8 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take big risks. The pot is only 10 chips.\n\nActually, checking seems reasonable here. I get to see a flop for free with a hand that needs to improve. If I hit a set on the flop, I can potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold to any aggression.\n\nRaising might be better if I think the opponent will fold often, but given they limped UTG (showing some interest), they might call with a wide range.\n\nLet me check: I'm getting infinite pot odds to check (0 to call). If I raise to say 12, I'm risking 8 more chips to win 10, needing fold equity > 44% for immediate profit. With opponent's fold-heavy tendencies, this might be good.\n\nBut actually, looking at the data again: In hand #26, they raised preflop. That's their only non-fold action. They've folded 9/10 times. But they just limped this hand, which is unusual for their pattern. Maybe they have a hand they want to see a flop with.\n\nI think checking is the conservative, correct play with 22 from BB against a limper. We take a free flop, hope to hit a set, and minimize risk. If we miss, we can fold easily.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 22 has good implied odds if we hit a set (\u224812.5% chance).

Preflop action: SB posted 2, I posted BB 4, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called, SB folded, I checked. So heads-up against Kimi-K2 Thinking who called from UTG? Actually Seat 1 is UTG? Let's see: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, Seat 2 is SB, Seat 3 is me (BB), Seat 4 is Button, Seat 5 is CO? Wait, typical 5-handed: Seat 1 UTG, Seat 2 SB, Seat 3 BB, Seat 4 Button, Seat 5 CO? Actually with 5 players: Button is Seat 4, CO is Seat 5, UTG is Seat 1, SB is Seat 2, BB is me. Yes.\n\nSo preflop: UTG called, SB folded, I checked. So I have pocket deuces. The flop is Jd As 8h. This is a terrible flop for pocket deuces. There's an Ace and a Jack, both overcards. I have bottom pair, but the Ace is a big overcard. UTG called preflop from UTG, which could be a wide range but likely includes many hands that hit this flop: AJ, A8, maybe suited connectors, maybe small pairs. They could have an Ace, a Jack, maybe a draw. My hand is weak.\n\nI need to decide whether to check or raise. I have position? Actually I'm BB, UTG is first to act postflop? Wait, postflop action: The flop is dealt, and now action starts with the first player after the button. The button is Seat 4 (folded). So first to act is Seat 5 (folded), then Seat 1 (UTG), then me (BB). Actually after button, the order is SB (folded), BB (me), UTG (Seat 1). Wait, typical order: Button acts last. So after flop, action starts with the first active player to the left of the button. Button is Seat 4 (folded). So next is Seat 5 (folded), then Seat 1 (UTG), then Seat 2 (SB folded), then me (BB). So UTG acts before me. But the prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check, raise\". That suggests it's my action now. Maybe UTG checked? The prompt doesn't show flop actions yet. It says \"Actions this hand:\" only shows preflop actions. So flop actions haven't happened yet. So I need to act first? Actually I'm BB, and UTG called preflop, so there are two players: UTG and me. Postflop, the first to act is the player closest to the left of the button. Button is Seat 4 (folded). So first active player is Seat 5 (folded), then Seat 1 (UTG). So UTG acts first. But maybe the prompt is showing that it's my action because UTG checked? The prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\". That means no bet facing me. So UTG must have checked. So I can check or raise.\n\nThus I should decide whether to bet or check. With bottom pair on a board with an Ace, likely UTG has an Ace sometimes. But they called preflop from UTG, which could be a wide range including small pairs, suited connectors, maybe some Ax hands. They might have an Ace, but they might also have a hand like 99-TT, maybe KQ, etc. If they have an Ace, they'll likely call or raise. If they have a weaker hand, they might fold.\n\nMy hand is weak but I have a pair. I could try to bet to represent an Ace and get folds from weaker hands. However, my stack is 195 chips (48.8 BB). The pot is 10 chips. A bet of maybe 5-8 chips could be reasonable. But if I get called, I'm likely behind. I have backdoor straight draws? Not really. Backdoor flush draw? I have 2d, board has Jd, so I have a backdoor diamond flush draw. That's something.\n\nI should consider opponent tendencies. Let's use recall_opponent_actions to see how Kimi-K2 Thinking plays.

They seem tight, folding many hands preflop. They called preflop this hand (hand 36). That suggests they have a decent hand, maybe medium pair, suited connectors, or maybe Ax suited. They didn't raise, so probably not premium like AA, KK, QQ, maybe not AK. Could be AJ, AT, maybe 99-TT, maybe suited connectors like JTs, 89s.\n\nGiven they called from UTG, their range is somewhat strong but not raising strong. On this flop with A J 8, they could have hit an Ace, a Jack, maybe a draw. My pocket deuces are likely behind. However, they might have missed entirely with hands like KQ, QT, T9, etc. If they have a small pair like 99-TT, they might be scared of the Ace.\n\nI could try a small bet to take the pot down. Pot is 10 chips. A bet of 6 chips (half pot) might get folds from hands that missed. If they call, I can reevaluate on turn. But if they raise, I'll have to fold.\n\nMy stack is 195 chips, so I have room to maneuver. However, I'm out of position (they act after me on future streets). That's a disadvantage. Actually wait: I'm BB, they are UTG. Postflop, the order is: UTG acts first, then me. But UTG checked, so now I act. If I bet, they will act after me. So I'm in position for this street? Actually after flop, UTG checked, I can bet, then UTG decides. So I'm last to act on this street, which is good. But on turn and river, the order will be UTG first, then me (since button is folded). So I'll be out of position on future streets. That's bad.\n\nGiven my weak hand and being out of position, maybe checking is better. I can see a free turn card. If turn is a 2, I improve to trips. If turn is a diamond, I get flush draw. Otherwise, I can fold if they bet.\n\nChecking seems reasonable. Let's also search for similar situations. Use search_observations for \"pocket deuces\" or \"22 flop\". But time is limited.\n\nI think checking is fine. I'll check and see what opponent does. If they bet on turn, I can fold. If they check, I can maybe bet on turn if I improve or if board gets scarier.\n\nThus I'll check.",

Our hand is too weak to value bet, and checking allows potential bluff on river if opponent shows weakness.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this situation. We're at the turn with pocket deuces (2d 2c) on a board of Jd As 8h 9d. The pot is only 10 chips. We're in the BB, and the only opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking in seat 1 who limped preflop and checked the flop.\n\nFrom the opponent data I recalled, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding a lot preflop (folded 8 of the last 10 actions). The only raise was hand 26 preflop, and the only other non-fold was hand 25 where they folded on the flop. This suggests they're playing tight/passive.\n\nOur hand is pocket deuces - we have bottom pair but it's a very weak pair on this board. The board has Ace high with J, 8, 9. There's a straight draw possibility (T-Q for a straight), and a flush draw with diamonds (we have 2d, so we have a backdoor diamond draw).\n\nThe pot is tiny (10 chips). We're first to act on the turn. We could:\n1. Check and see what opponent does\n2. Bet small to try to take down the pot\n\nGiven opponent's tight/passive tendencies, they likely have a weak hand if they just limped preflop and checked flop. They might have a small pocket pair, suited connectors, or weak Ace. They might fold to any bet.\n\nHowever, our hand is also very weak. We're essentially bluffing if we bet. But the pot is small, and we have position (we act after them on the river if we check now).\n\nActually, wait - I need to check the action order. We're in BB, they're in seat 1. On the turn, we act first since we're OOP. So if we check, they get to act last on both turn and river.\n\nGiven the small pot and our weak hand, checking seems reasonable. We can see if they bet, and if they do, we can fold. If they check behind, we get a free river card and might improve to trips or a backdoor flush.\n\nBut actually, we have a very weak pair. If we bet and they call, we're likely behind. If we check and they bet, we'll have to fold. So maybe a small bet could take it down.\n\nLet me think about pot odds. If we bet 4 chips (minimum), we're risking 4 to win 10, so we need them to fold 28.6% of the time (4/(10+4)). Given their tight/passive play, they might fold a lot.\n\nBut if they call, we're likely behind and have only 2 outs to improve (two remaining deuces). That's about 4% chance to hit trips on river.\n\nActually, wait - we also have a backdoor flush draw with the 2d. That's about 4% additional equity. So total ~8% chance to improve on river.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, we have 48.8 BB stack, which is healthy. No need to take big risks.\n\nI think checking is the best play. We keep the pot small, get to see a free river, and can evaluate then. If opponent bets, we can easily fold our weak hand.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: The opponent limped preflop and checked flop. They likely have a weak hand. A small bet might take it down immediately. But if they call, we're in a bad spot on the river.\n\nGiven their tight tendencies (lots of preflop folds), they might fold to any bet. But they did limp this hand, so they have something.\n\nI think checking is safer and allows us to potentially bluff on the river if we sense weakness.\n\nI'll check.",

My hand is extremely weak - bottom pair that doesn't beat any board card\n2. Opponent has checked twice already (flop and turn)\n3. Opponent is generally passive\n4. Pot is small (10 chips)\n5. I'm in position (acting first on river)\n\n**Possible lines:**\n- Check: Likely go to showdown, hope opponent also checks and my deuces somehow win\n- Raise/bluff: Try to steal the pot with a bet\n\n**Bluff considerations:**\n- Board has A and J high, could represent an Ace or Jack\n- Opponent has shown willingness to call rivers with marginal hands (hand 24 called 8 with pair of 8s)\n- Opponent checked twice, suggesting weakness\n- If I bet small (4-8 chips), giving 2:1 or 3:1 odds, might get a fold\n- But opponent called river bet in hand 24 with just pair of 8s\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 48.8 BB, healthy stack\n- Risking 4-8 chips to win 10 is reasonable\n- But if called, I lose showdown with bottom pair\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to call rivers with marginal hands (pair of 8s in hand 24), and my hand is literally the worst possible pair (deuces), a bluff might not work. However, the opponent has shown passivity and checked twice. A small bet might take it down.\n\nBut actually, thinking more: The board has A high. If opponent had an Ace, they likely would have bet at some point. They checked flop and turn. They could have a weak Jack, 9, 8, or 5, or a missed draw. My deuces lose to all of those.\n\nI think a small bluff could work. Let's bet 4 chips (minimum raise). If opponent calls with any pair, I lose, but they might fold a weak hand.\n\nActually wait - I'm the BB, I already have 4 chips in the pot from my blind. The pot is 10 chips total. If I bet 4 more, that's risking 4 to win 10, giving opponent 3.5:1 odds. That's a good price for them to call with any pair.\n\nMaybe I should check and hope they check behind. But if they bet, I'd have to fold.\n\nGiven opponent's passivity and my weak hand, I think checking is safer. The pot is small, not worth bluffing.\n\n**Final decision:** Check and go to showdown. If opponent bets, I fold. If opponent checks, I show down my deuces and likely lose, but only lose the 4 chips I already put in.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket deuces is bottom pair on A-high board, loses to any pair.

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this river situation. I have 2d 2c, bottom pair on a board of Jd As 8h 9d 5h. The pot is 10 chips. I'm in the BB, opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking is in seat 1. The action is on me to act first on the river. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand is very weak - bottom pair with deuces on an A-high board. The board has no flush possibilities (two diamonds but not three of same suit), straight possibilities: there's a possible straight with T-Q, but not with the current cards. My deuces are likely only beating a complete bluff.\n\nThe opponent has checked twice (flop and turn), suggesting weakness. They just called preflop from UTG, so their range is wide but likely includes some Aces, maybe weak Jacks, middle pairs, suited connectors.\n\nGiven the small pot (10 chips) and my weak hand, a check seems correct. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands. The opponent might call with any pair, maybe even Ace-high. A bluff raise could work if opponent has complete air, but given they called preflop and checked twice, they might have something like a weak pair or draw that missed.\n\nLooking at opponent's river actions: they've folded once, checked once, called once in previous hands. Not enough data to determine strong tendencies.\n\nMy stack is 195 chips (48.8 BB), healthy. The pot is tiny relative to stacks. No need to risk chips with a weak hand.\n\nI should check and hope to win at showdown if opponent also checks or if they bluff and I call? Actually, if I check and they bet, I'd have to decide whether to call. But checking seems right now.\n\nSo action: check.",

My only UTG win was with premium cards (QQ), reinforcing that I need strong hands from this position.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been folding frequently in recent hands\n- When they do raise, it's typically to 8-12 chips, suggesting they have decent hands\n\n**Stack and Tournament Considerations:**\n- At 48 BB, I have a healthy stack and can afford to wait for better spots\n- No need to take marginal risks when there are better opportunities ahead\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 6c 9c from UTG doesn't have sufficient equity to justify calling, especially without knowing how other players will act.

Most of my UTG hands have been weak (2s-Ks, Kd-2s, Jh-4s, Ah-3d, etc.). I did have one success with Qh-Qc where I raised and won 36 chips.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom Seat 2 (Kimi-K2), I can see their recent preflop actions:\n- They've been folding a lot (most recent actions are folds)\n- They did raise to 8 in hand #22 and to 12 in hand #27\n- They called 8 in hand #30 and showed down Ts-6s (which lost to a full house)\n- Their last action was a check in hand #35\n\n**Position and Stack Considerations:**\n- UTG is the worst position - I have to act first with no information\n- I have 192 chips (48 BB) - decent stack size\n- Pot is 6 chips, need to call 4 to continue\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- Mid-stack (48 BB), need to be selective but can take some risks\n- Should avoid marginal calls that don't have good implied odds\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 6c 9c is too weak to play from UTG position, especially when facing a call requirement. Even though it's suited connectors which have some potential, the UTG position combined with the need to call makes this unprofitable. \n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot. My recent history shows I've been correctly folding weak hands from UTG, and this hand fits that pattern.\n",

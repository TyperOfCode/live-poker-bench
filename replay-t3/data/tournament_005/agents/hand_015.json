This is their first raise in the last 15 hands.\n\nI have TT (tens) on the BTN. This is a strong hand, especially against a tight player. I should consider:\n1. 3-betting for value - TT is ahead of a tight player's raising range\n2. The raise size is 8 (4bb), which is standard\n3. I have 102.5bb, plenty deep\n4. I'm on the button, so position is perfect\n\nAgainst a tight player, I should 3-bet to isolate and get value. The minimum raise is to 14, but I should make it larger to:\n- Charge their strong hands\n- Fold out their marginal hands\n- Build a pot with my strong hand\n\nA standard 3-bet size would be 3x their raise, so around 24-30 chips. Given the stack depths, I can go to 30 chips to put pressure on them while still being able to fold if they 4-bet large.\n\nLet me think about what hands a tight player would raise from MP:\n- Premium pairs: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT\n- Strong broadway: AK, AQ, maybe AJs, KQs\n\nMy TT is flipping against AK, AQ and dominated by JJ+, but ahead of everything else. I need to 3-bet for value and see how they react.\n\nIf they 4-bet, I can fold comfortably knowing they likely have JJ+ or AK. If they call, I can play postflop with position.\n\nI'll make a substantial 3-bet to 30 chips.",

            "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket tens (Td Tc) and the flop comes Th 3s Qc, giving me three of a kind (tens). This is a very strong hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have trip tens (three of a kind). The board shows Th 3s Qc. There are no flush or straight draws immediately visible. I have the best possible hand right now unless my opponent has Q-Q (pocket queens) for a higher set.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is excellent position.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Only DeepSeek-V3.2 is still in the hand. Looking at their history:\n   - They've been very tight, folding most preflop hands\n   - They raised preflop to 8 (4 BB), so they likely have a strong hand\n   - They called my 3-bet to 30, indicating real strength\n   - Based on their tight play, they likely have: QQ, AQ, KQ, QJ, or maybe a strong pocket pair like JJ or AA/KK\n\n4. **Pot size**: 62 chips\n   - Preflop: 1 (SB) + 2 (BB) + 8 (raise) + 30 (my 3-bet) + 22 (call) = 63 chips, but shown as 62\n   - My stack: 176 - 30 = 146 chips remaining\n\n5. **Board texture**: Th 3s Qc\n   - I have trip tens\n   - Possible opponent hands:\n     - QQ: They have a set of queens (beating me badly)\n     - AQ: They have top pair top kicker\n     - KQ/QJ: They have top pair\n     - AA/KK: They have an overpair\n     - QT: They have two pair (unlikely given my tens)\n   \n6. **Action**: It's checked to me (amount to call is 0). I should bet for value here.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing:\n- The pot is 62 chips\n- I have 146 chips left\n- I want to get value from top pair hands (AQ, KQ, QJ) and overpairs (AA, KK)\n- I also need to protect against draws (though there aren't many obvious ones)\n- A bet of about 2/3 pot (40-45 chips) seems appropriate\n\nHowever, I should also consider that this opponent is tight. If they have QQ, I'm crushed. But if they have AQ or KQ, I want to get value. Given their tight nature and the fact they called my 3-bet, QQ is definitely in their range, but it's only one hand combination.\n\nThe most likely scenario is they have AQ or KQ and I have the best hand. I should bet for value.\n\nMinimum raise is 22, which would be a very small bet (less than half pot). I should bet more.\n\nLet me bet 45 chips, which is about 72% of pot - a solid value bet that builds the pot while still getting calls from top pair hands.",

Being UTG means I have to act first after the blinds, which is a disadvantage. Pocket 9s is borderline for opening UTG - it's playable but needs caution.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot of marginal hands, which is reasonable. The opponents seem to be AI players (Kimi-K2 Thinking, Kimi-K2, MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B). I don't have much specific history on their tendencies yet.\n\nPot odds: need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds preflop. But if I just call, I invite others to come in behind me with better hands.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (103 BB), so I can afford to be somewhat selective. Pocket 9s has good set-mining potential (hitting a 9 on the flop about 12% of the time).\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold - conservative but maybe too tight for pocket 9s\n2. Call - allows others in, could get raised behind me\n3. Raise - standard play with medium pocket pairs, builds pot for set mining, defines hand strength\n\nI think raising is best. It reduces the field, builds the pot for when I hit a set, and I can often take it down preflop if everyone folds. A standard raise would be 3-4x BB, so 6-8 chips total. Since minimum raise is to 4 (2 more), I should raise to 6 or 8.\n\nLet me check typical raise sizes. With 103 BB, raising to 8 (4x) is reasonable. That's 8 total chips, putting in 6 more.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 9s is a playable hand UTG at 103 BB.

            "reasoning_content": "Now let me think about this situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with pocket 9s. I raised to 8 (4x BB). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) 3-bet to 30 from SB. That's a significant 3-bet - they made it 30 total, which is a raise of 22 more to me (since I already put in 8).\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: They folded a lot early (hands 2-8), then started getting more active. They raised to 6 in hand 11 and to 12 in hand 12. This 3-bet to 30 is much larger than their previous raises. This suggests they might have a premium hand.\n\nPot is currently 40 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + my 8 + their 30). I need to call 22 to continue.\n\nMy stack: 198 chips, I already have 8 in, so I have 190 left. If I call, I'll have 168 left.\n\nOpponent stack: 176 chips, they have 30 in, so 146 left.\n\nThis is a tournament situation. Pocket 9s is a medium pair. Against a 3-bet from SB, their range could be wide, but given their sizing (30 total, which is 15x BB), this looks strong. They might have TT+, AK, maybe AQ.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 22 to win 40+22 = 62. That's about 35% pot odds.\n\nEquity of 99 vs a tight range (JJ+, AK): about 40%\nEquity of 99 vs wider range (TT+, AJ+, KQ): about 45%\n\nSo mathematically, calling might be okay if I think they're not super tight. But there are considerations:\n\n1. Position: I'm out of position (they're SB, I'm BB)\n2. Stack sizes: If I call, pot will be 62, and I'll have 168 left (about 2.7x pot). SPR ~2.7, which is awkward for set mining.\n3. Tournament: We're both deep (99 BB effective). Losing 22 chips here isn't devastating, but getting stacked with 99 would be.\n\nGiven the opponent's recent aggression (raising last 2 hands they played) and this large 3-bet size, I'm leaning toward folding. The 3-bet is quite large relative to previous raises (6, 12 to now 30). This feels like strength.\n\nHowever, I could consider a 4-bet bluff or call. But 99 doesn't play great out of position postflop, especially if an overcard comes.\n\nI think folding is prudent here. Let's preserve our stack and wait for better spots. We're not desperate - we have 99 BB.\n\nBut wait, I should check my own history to see if I've been aggressive.",

Opponent's previous raises were smaller (6, 12), but large 3-bet suggests strength. Calling to set-mine is reasonable tournament play.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with pocket 9s (9s 9c). My stack is 198 chips (99 BB). The pot is 40 chips. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 30 total after I raised to 8. I need to call 22 more.\n\nFrom opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has made preflop raises of 6 and 12 in previous hands (hands 11 and 12). This 30 raise is much larger. They haven't shown any calling tendencies preflop.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 9s is a medium pocket pair. Against a 3-bet from the SB, this is a tough spot. The pot odds: I need to call 22 to win 40 + 30 = 70 total pot (40 already + his 30 raise). That's 22 to win 70, or about 1:3.2, needing ~31% equity.\n\nAgainst a typical 3-betting range from SB (maybe JJ+, AK, AQ), pocket 9s has about 40-45% equity. Against a tighter range (QQ+, AK), it's about 35-40%. Against a super tight range (KK+, AA), it's about 20%.\n\nGiven the opponent's previous raises were smaller (6 and 12), this large 30 raise suggests strength. However, at 99 BB deep, I have good implied odds if I hit a set on the flop (about 7.5:1 odds to flop a set). Calling 22 with 198 stack gives me position (he's SB, I'm BB postflop).\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack. Folding preserves chips. Calling risks 22 chips (11% of stack) with potential to win more if I hit a set.\n\nThe minimum raise to is 52, which would be a 4-bet. With pocket 9s, 4-betting seems ambitious unless I think he's light. His large 3-bet suggests strength.\n\nI should consider calling to see a flop and potentially stack him if I hit a set. The pot odds are reasonable, and implied odds are good with deep stacks.\n\nHowever, I'm out of position postflop (he acts first on flop). That's a disadvantage.\n\nLet me think: If I call, pot will be 70. My stack remaining: 176. If I miss the flop and he bets, I'll likely have to fold. If I hit a set, I can potentially win his entire 176 stack.\n\nThe risk: 22 chips. The reward: potentially 176 chips. That's 8:1 implied odds, which is good for set mining (need about 7.5:1).\n\nI think calling is reasonable. Folding is also fine to preserve chips. But given the stack depths and tournament, I'll call.\n\nWait, I raised to 8 initially (from BB). He 3-bet to 30. My initial raise was small. He might be punishing my small raise with a wider range.\n\nActually, looking at the action: I raised to 8 from BB after SB posted 1 and BB posted 2. That's a 4x raise (2+8=10 total? Wait: blinds are 1/2. SB posted 1, BB posted 2. I raised to 8 total, which is 6 more than BB's 2. So it's a 3x raise over BB.\n\nHe 3-bet to 30, which is a large sizing.\n\nI'll call.",

            "content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand:**\n- My position: BB (Seat 3)\n- My cards: 9\u2660 9\u2663\n- My stack: 176 chips (88 BB)\n- Pot: 107 chips\n- Board: T\u2665 3\u2660 Q\u2663\n- Opponent: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) with 131 chips\n- Action: Opponent bet 45, I need to call 45\n\n**Preflop action recap:**\n- I raised to 8 from BB (standard raise with pocket 9s)\n- Seat 1 (SB) 3-bet to 30 (significant raise)\n- I called the additional 22 (pot was getting sizable)\n\n**Flop analysis:**\nBoard: T\u2665 3\u2660 Q\u2663\nThis is a somewhat wet board with two overcards to my 9s. The Q and T are both higher than my 9s. My hand is now essentially a pocket pair below the board cards.\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nSeat 1 has shown some aggression:\n- Hand 11: Raised preflop to 6, then checked flop/turn, folded river\n- Hand 12: Raised preflop to 12, bet 16 on flop\n- Hand 14: Checked preflop (as SB), bet 5 on flop\n\nThe 3-bet preflop to 30 is quite large relative to blinds (1/2). This suggests a strong range: likely QQ+, AK, maybe AQ, JJ, TT. The flop bet of 45 into 107 pot (~42% pot) is a continuation bet.\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- I have middle pair (9s) but board has Q and T\n- I need a 9 on turn or river to improve (2 outs)\n- Could also hit a straight draw if board runs out J-8 or 8-7 (unlikely)\n- Essentially I'm playing for set value, but I already missed\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 107 + 45 = 152 if I call\nI need to call 45 to win 152\nPot odds: 45/(152+45) = 45/197 \u2248 22.8%\n\n**Implied odds:**\nIf I hit my set on turn (2 outs \u2248 4.3%), I could potentially win opponent's remaining 86 chips (131 - 45 = 86)\nBut opponent might not pay off if board gets scary\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have 176 chips, opponent has 131. If I call and lose, I'll be at 131 chips. If I fold, I'm at 176 chips. This is a significant portion of my stack.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. The board hits a 3-bettor's range hard (QQ, TT, AQ, KQ all love this flop)\n2. My 9s are likely behind unless opponent has AK/JJ\n3. The bet size (45 into 107) is standard continuation, not necessarily super strong\n4. I have position for the rest of the hand\n5. I'm getting about 3.4:1 pot odds (need ~23% equity)\n\n**Equity estimate:**\nAgainst a 3-bet range of QQ+, AK, AQ, JJ, TT:\n- QQ: I'm crushed (2 outs)\n- KK/AA: I'm crushed (2 outs)  \n- AK: I'm ahead (6 outs for them)\n- AQ: I'm behind (pair of Qs, they have 5 outs)\n- JJ: I'm ahead (2 outs for them)\n- TT: I'm crushed (set)\n\nOverall, I likely have around 25-30% equity against this range. The pot odds of 23% are close. However, there's reverse implied odds - if I'm ahead, I might not get paid much, if I'm behind, I could lose more.\n\nGiven the tournament situation and that I have position but a marginal hand, I think folding is prudent. The 3-bet preflop was large, and the flop continuation suggests strength. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n**Alternative consideration:** If I think opponent is aggressive and could be bluffing with AK, maybe I could call. But with my stack size, it's risky.\n\nI'll fold."

With the blinds at 1/2 and facing a raise to 8 chips (4x the big blind), this is a clear fold situation.\n\nEven though I'm in the cutoff position which is relatively good, 7-3 offsuit is one of the weakest starting hands in poker.

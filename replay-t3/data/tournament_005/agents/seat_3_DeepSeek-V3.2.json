Ten-high with unsuited, unconnected cards. This is one of the weakest starting hands in poker.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm in the small blind, which is the worst position post-flop. I'll have to act first on every street if I continue.\n\n3. **Stack sizes:** We're all deep (100 BB effective stacks). This means implied odds are decent, but reverse implied odds are also high with such a weak hand.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies:** I have limited data on Kimi-K2. They folded preflop in hand #1. No raise history seen. This is only hand #2, so I don't have much information.\n\n5. **Pot odds:** Pot is currently 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 5 to win 9, giving me 1.8:1 pot odds (35.7% equity needed). My hand has nowhere near this equity against a typical raising range.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** Early in a tournament with deep stacks, preserving chips is important. Getting involved with Th4s from the small blind is generally a losing proposition.\n\n7. **Alternatives:** \n   - Fold: Clear choice with this hand\n   - Call: Would be terrible - out of position with a weak hand\n   - Raise: Would be even worse - bloating the pot with garbage\n\n**Decision:** This is an easy fold. Th4s is not a hand worth playing from the small blind against a raise, especially with no read on the opponent. The pot odds don't justify continuing, and position makes it even worse.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Th4s is too weak to play from small blind against a raise.

MiniMax-M2 (SB) has 197 chips, GPT-OSS-120B (BB) has 198 chips. \n\nFrom the opponent history, both have been folding preflop in the first two hands. This suggests they might be playing tight.

I could call to see a flop, but with such a weak hand, I'm likely to miss the flop completely or hit a weak pair that's vulnerable. Raising would be risky with this hand - I'd be putting more money in with a weak holding.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I have 100 BB, which is a healthy stack. There's no need to gamble with such a weak hand. Better to wait for better opportunities.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds.

They're not overly tight.\n\nGiven that I'm on the button with position, but the hand is very weak (8T offsuit), and the raise is 4x BB which is somewhat strong, folding seems correct. The pot odds aren't great for such a weak hand, and even with position, 8T offsuit plays poorly against a raising range.\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger spot with my deep stack.

Very tight player.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised 3 times out of 8 hands, showing some aggression. They raised to 6 and 8 chips in previous hands.\n\nMy position is UTG, the worst position to play from, especially with a weak hand. There are 4 players left to act after me (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, and the blinds).\n\nWith 72o:\n- Extremely weak hand, no straight or flush potential\n- Easily dominated by any pair or higher cards\n- Even if I hit a pair, it's likely to be second-best\n- Playing out of position makes it even worse\n\nTournament considerations:\n- I have a healthy 100 BB stack\n- No need to gamble with trash hands\n- Better to preserve chips for better spots\n\nPot odds: 2 chips to call into 3 chip pot (1.5:1 odds), but implied odds are terrible because I'll be out of position and the hand is so weak.\n\nGiven all this, folding is the only reasonable play.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm in the big blind with 8h Jh. The opponent in seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 6 total (a 4-chip raise from 2 to 6). The pot is 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 4 more chips.\n\nFrom the opponent history, seat 1 has been folding most hands preflop (6 out of 9 hands they folded preflop). In hand 9 they checked in the BB when facing no raise. This is their first raise that I've seen. This could indicate a strong hand, or possibly they're taking advantage of their position (UTG) and the fact that several players have folded.\n\nMy hand is 8h Jh - suited but not great. J8s is a marginal hand, especially out of position. However, I'm getting good pot odds: I need to call 4 chips to win a pot of 9 chips, which is 2.25:1 odds (about 30.8% equity needed).\n\nIn tournament poker from the BB, I should defend with a wider range when getting good odds. J8s has some playability postflop with flush and straight potential, though it's not premium.\n\nMy stack is 198 chips (99 BB) - healthy. Opponent has 188 chips.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight folding history, their raise might indicate a stronger than average hand. But since it's their first raise, they could be raising with a wider range than I'd expect from their previous folding pattern.\n\nConsidering pot odds and position: I'm out of position which is a disadvantage. But the pot odds are good.\n\nI think this is a borderline decision. In tournament play with deep stacks, I could consider calling with J8s getting good odds, but being out of position against what might be a strong hand is concerning.\n\nLet me think about alternatives: Folding is safe but might be too tight given the odds. Raising is possible but with J8s out of position, that's likely not optimal unless I think I can push them off their hand. They raised from UTG, so they likely have some strength.\n\nGiven the tournament context and my stack size, I think the best play is to call and see a flop. If I hit something strong (pair with good kicker, flush draw, straight draw), I can continue. If I miss completely, I can fold to further aggression.\n\nThe pot odds justify a call with a suited connector type hand. Let's call.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n- **My hand**: 8h Jh on a flop of Ah 9s 7s\n- **Position**: BB (out of position)\n- **Stack**: 194 chips (97 BB)\n- **Pot**: 13 chips\n- **Board**: Ah 9s 7s (two spades on board)\n- **Opponent**: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised preflop from UTG to 6 total (4 more after my BB)\n- **My action**: I called preflop from BB with 8h Jh\n- **Current street**: Flop, no bet to call (amount to call: 0)\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: Kimi-K2 Thinking has mostly folded preflop (7 out of 10 hands), checked once, and folded to a bet on the flop. This is their first preflop raise I've seen, which suggests they might have a decent hand.\n\nMy hand analysis:\n- **8h Jh** is not great on this **Ah 9s 7s** flop\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (T would give me a straight: T-8-7-9-A? Wait, actually 8-J would need 10 for a straight, but with 7-9 on board, I need a 10 for an 8-9-T-J straight, but the board has A-9-7, so I need T for 7-8-9-T straight, but I have J-8, so T gives me 7-8-9-T-J straight)\n- Actually: Board is A-9-7, I have J-8. I need a 10 for 7-8-9-T-J straight\n- So I have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs)\n- I also have a backdoor flush draw (hearts, but board has two spades)\n- Very weak pair potential (only 8 or J would give me a pair)\n- The Ace on board likely hit the preflop raiser's range\n\nGiven that:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. My hand has very little equity (gutshot straight draw only)\n3. The opponent likely has a strong hand given their preflop raise from UTG\n4. The Ace on board is scary and likely hit their range\n5. I have position disadvantage\n\nI should check and see what the opponent does. If they bet, I'll likely fold. Checking gives me a free card to potentially hit my straight, but I should be prepared to fold to any bet.\n\nSince amount to call is 0, I should check.",

We have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs to a Ten)\n2. The board has two spades, so flush draw possible for opponent\n3. Our hand has very little showdown value currently\n4. We could try a semi-bluff bet to take down the pot\n5. Checking to see a free river card might be better\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check:** See free river card, preserve chips\n- **Bet:** Semi-bluff to represent strength, possibly win pot now\n\nGiven the opponent checked the flop after raising preflop, they might have missed the board or have a medium-strength hand. A small bet could take it down, but we're out of position.\n\nActually, let me think about the straight draw more carefully. We need a Ten. There are 4 Tens in the deck. With 46 unknown cards, we have ~8.7% chance to hit on river. Pot is 13 chips. If we bet and get called, we'd need good implied odds.\n\nGiven our weak hand and being out of position, checking seems prudent. We get a free river card and can reevaluate. If we hit our Ten, we can value bet. If we miss, we can check-fold.\n\nThe risk of betting is that we get raised and have to fold, or we build a pot we can't win without hitting.\n\nI'll check.",

Opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking in Seat 1 with 188 chips. Preflop: SB posted 1, I posted BB 2, Seat 1 raised to 6, SB folded, I called 4 more. Flop and turn were checked through.\n\nNow river: Th completes board: Ah 9s 7s 6d Th. I have 8h Jh - that's a jack-high hand with no pair. Board has Ah, Th, 9s, 7s, 6d. My Jh is second highest card but no pair. I have a gutshot straight draw that missed: I needed a Q for a straight (8-9-T-J-Q). Actually with 8h Jh on board Ah 9s 7s 6d Th, what hand do I have? Let's see: I have J high, no pair. Board has Ah, Th, 9s, 7s, 6d. I have no flush possibilities. Best possible hand is ace-high with J kicker? Actually I have J high, board has A, T, 9, 7, 6. So my hand is J high, no pair. That's terrible.\n\nBut opponent checked flop and turn. They raised preflop from UTG? Actually Seat 1 is UTG? Let's see positions: Seat 1 is first to act preflop? Actually table has 5 players: Seat 1, 2 (SB), 3 (BB me), 4, 5. So Seat 1 is UTG. They raised to 6 (3x BB). I called from BB with 8h Jh. That's a speculative call with suited one-gapper? Actually 8h Jh is suited? 8h Jh are both hearts? 8h is heart, Jh is heart? Wait 8h is heart, Jh is heart? Jh is heart? Actually Jh is heart? Card notation: 8h = 8 of hearts, Jh = Jack of hearts. Yes both hearts! So I have suited connectors! 8h Jh suited hearts. Board has Ah (ace hearts), Th (ten hearts), 9s, 7s, 6d. Wait Th is ten of hearts? Actually Th is ten of hearts? Notation: Th = ten of hearts. So board has two hearts: Ah and Th. I have 8h and Jh, so I have four hearts! That's a flush draw! Oh I missed that! I have a flush draw! Let's count: Board hearts: Ah, Th. My hearts: 8h, Jh. That's four hearts total. I need one more heart for flush. Did any heart come on river? River is Th - that's ten of hearts! That's a heart! So board has three hearts: Ah, Th, Th (river). Actually river is Th, same as turn? Wait turn was 6d, river is Th. So board hearts: Ah (flop), Th (river). That's two hearts on board. Plus my two hearts = four hearts. No flush. I need five hearts. So no flush.\n\nBut I have straight possibilities? Board: A, 9, 7, 6, T. With 8 and J, I have possible straight: 7-8-9-T-J? That's a straight! Yes! Board: 7s, 9s, Th, 6d, Ah. I have 8h and Jh. That gives me 6-7-8-9-T-J? Wait 6,7,8,9,T,J is a straight: 6 to J. Actually 6,7,8,9,T,J is a straight: six-high straight. Let's check: 6,7,8,9,T,J all consecutive. Yes! I have a straight! Board: 6d, 7s, 8h (my card), 9s, Th (river), Jh (my card). That's a straight! I have 6-7-8-9-T-J. That's a jack-high straight. That's a strong hand!\n\nWait need to confirm: My cards: 8h, Jh. Board: Ah, 9s, 7s, 6d, Th. So cards: 6,7,8,9,T,J. Yes that's a straight. The ace is irrelevant but doesn't interfere. So I have a straight! That's a very strong hand on this board. What could beat me? Higher straight: someone with QJ would have 7-8-9-T-J-Q (7 to Q"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this river situation. I'm in the BB with 8h Jh on board Ah 9s 7s 6d Th. Pot is 13 chips. My stack is 194 chips (97 BB). Opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking in Seat 1 with 188 chips. Preflop: SB posted 1, I posted BB 2, Seat 1 raised to 6, SB folded, I called 4 more. Flop and turn were checked through.\n\nNow river: Th completes board: Ah 9s 7s 6d Th. I have 8h Jh - that's a jack-high hand with no pair. Board has Ah, Th, 9s, 7s, 6d. My Jh is second highest card but no pair. I have a gutshot straight draw that missed: I needed a Q for a straight (8-9-T-J-Q). Actually with 8h Jh on board Ah 9s 7s 6d Th, what hand do I have? Let's see: I have J high, no pair. Board has Ah, Th, 9s, 7s, 6d. I have no flush possibilities. Best possible hand is ace-high with J kicker? Actually I have J high, board has A, T, 9, 7, 6. So my hand is J high, no pair. That's terrible.\n\nBut opponent checked flop and turn. They raised preflop from UTG? Actually Seat 1 is UTG? Let's see positions: Seat 1 is first to act preflop? Actually table has 5 players: Seat 1, 2 (SB), 3 (BB me), 4, 5. So Seat 1 is UTG. They raised to 6 (3x BB). I called from BB with 8h Jh. That's a speculative call with suited one-gapper? Actually 8h Jh is suited? 8h Jh are both hearts? 8h is heart, Jh is heart? Wait 8h is heart, Jh is heart? Jh is heart? Actually Jh is heart? Card notation: 8h = 8 of hearts, Jh = Jack of hearts. Yes both hearts! So I have suited connectors! 8h Jh suited hearts. Board has Ah (ace hearts), Th (ten hearts), 9s, 7s, 6d. Wait Th is ten of hearts? Actually Th is ten of hearts? Notation: Th = ten of hearts. So board has two hearts: Ah and Th. I have 8h and Jh, so I have four hearts! That's a flush draw! Oh I missed that! I have a flush draw! Let's count: Board hearts: Ah, Th. My hearts: 8h, Jh. That's four hearts total. I need one more heart for flush. Did any heart come on river? River is Th - that's ten of hearts! That's a heart! So board has three hearts: Ah, Th, Th (river). Actually river is Th, same as turn? Wait turn was 6d, river is Th. So board hearts: Ah (flop), Th (river). That's two hearts on board. Plus my two hearts = four hearts. No flush. I need five hearts. So no flush.\n\nBut I have straight possibilities? Board: A, 9, 7, 6, T. With 8 and J, I have possible straight: 7-8-9-T-J? That's a straight! Yes! Board: 7s, 9s, Th, 6d, Ah. I have 8h and Jh. That gives me 6-7-8-9-T-J? Wait 6,7,8,9,T,J is a straight: 6 to J. Actually 6,7,8,9,T,J is a straight: six-high straight. Let's check: 6,7,8,9,T,J all consecutive. Yes! I have a straight! Board: 6d, 7s, 8h (my card), 9s, Th (river), Jh (my card). That's a straight! I have 6-7-8-9-T-J. That's a jack-high straight. That's a strong hand!\n\nWait need to confirm: My cards: 8h, Jh. Board: Ah, 9s, 7s, 6d, Th. So cards: 6,7,8,9,T,J. Yes that's a straight. The ace is irrelevant but doesn't interfere. So I have a straight! That's a very strong hand on this board. What could beat me? Higher straight: someone with QJ would have 7-8-9-T-J-Q (7 to Q",

          "reasoning_content": "I see Kimi-K2 Thinking has mostly folded preflop. Only hand 9 they checked and then folded on flop. This is their first raise preflop (hand 11). They raised UTG to 6 (3x). Then checked flop and turn. Their range could be medium pairs, suited connectors, broadway cards. They checked twice, likely missed flop or has medium strength. The board is draw-heavy with straight and flush possibilities. They might have missed or have a medium pair like TT, JJ, QQ, maybe AK/AQ missed.\n\nI have a straight (6-7-8-9-T-J). This is strong but vulnerable to higher straights (QJ). However, with board A-9-7-6-T, QJ makes 7-8-9-T-J-Q (7 to Q). That's possible but less likely. Also possible flush if someone has spades (board has 9s, 7s). But I have the nuts for straight unless QJ is out there.\n\nPot is 13. I can check or bet. If I bet, I might get called by worse hands: maybe A9, AT, maybe TT, JJ, or weaker pairs. Could also get called by missed draws trying to bluff catch. Or they might bluff if I check.\n\nGiven opponent's passive history (mostly folds), they might not call a bet without a strong hand. But they did raise preflop and check twice, so they might have a medium pair that's now scared of straight. A bet of 6-8 chips (half pot) might get called by Ax hands. Checking could induce a bluff if they have missed AK/AQ.\n\nBut I have a strong hand and should value bet. Small bet like 6 chips (less than half pot) could get called by Ax, pairs. If they have QJ, they might raise. But that's unlikely.\n\nI'll bet small for value. Let's raise to 6 (total bet of 6 since amount to call is 0).

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ah Qc - AQo is a strong hand, especially from the SB position. It's a premium hand but not quite AA, KK, QQ, AK.\n\n2. **Current action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 4, then Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) 3-bet to 12. I need to call 11 chips.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm in SB (worst position), which makes playing this hand more difficult postflop since I'll be out of position against both players.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - My stack: 206 chips (103 BB)\n   - Seat 1: 176 chips\n   - Seat 4 (BB yet to act): 198 chips\n   - Seat 5: 193 chips\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 19 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 4 raise + 12 3-bet). I need to call 11 to win 30, giving me pot odds of about 1:2.7 (27% equity needed). AQo against a 3-betting range likely has around 30-40% equity depending on opponent's range.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot preflop, but just raised to 6 in hand 11. This 3-bet to 12 suggests a strong hand.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been folding a lot preflop, showed 2s5s in one showdown. The initial raise to 4 could be a wider range.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (103 BB). Being in the SB with AQo facing a 3-bet is tricky. Folding preserves my stack. Calling puts me in a difficult spot postflop out of position. 4-betting could be an option but risks a lot of chips.\n\n8. **Additional factors**: The BB (Seat 4) still has to act behind me, which adds more complexity. If I call, the BB might squeeze or call as well.\n\nGiven the position disadvantage and the strength of the 3-bet (especially from an opponent who has been folding frequently), I think the prudent play is to fold. AQo doesn't play well multi-way out of position against what appears to be a strong 3-betting range. The pot odds are decent but not great given the positional disadvantage.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot with position.",

It's offsuit, low cards with a big gap (3-7).\n- Position: BTN - Good position, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n- Stack: 206 chips (103 BB) - Healthy stack.\n- Action: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 6 (3x BB). This is a standard raise size.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the data, Kimi-K2 has raised preflop in 3 of the 12 hands I've seen:\n- Hand 2: raised 6\n- Hand 7: raised 6  \n- Hand 8: raised 8\n\nThis suggests Kimi-K2 is moderately aggressive preflop. The 6-chip raise (3x BB) is consistent.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 6 to win 9, so pot odds are 6:9 or 1:1.5. I need ~40% equity to call.\n\n**Hand strength:**\n3c 7d has terrible equity against a standard raising range. Even against a wide range, it's probably around 25-30% equity at best. Against a tighter range, it's worse.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (103 BB)\n- This is a weak speculative hand that needs to hit a miracle flop\n- Calling 6 chips (3% of my stack) isn't huge, but it's still -EV\n- Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots\n\n**Position considerations:**\nWhile being on the button is great, the hand is just too weak. Even if I call, I'll be out of position relative to the raiser (who is in seat 2, which appears to be UTG+1 or MP).\n\n**Decision:**\nFold. This hand is not playable for a raise, even from the button. The pot odds aren't good enough given the hand's terrible equity. Better to wait for a better spot with a stronger hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"3c7d is too weak to call a 3x raise even from the button.

This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I have to act first postflop, making it hard to play marginal hands.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop in last 2 hands (6 and 12 chips). They seem aggressive.\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) hasn't shown much aggression preflop.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has raised preflop twice (both to 4 chips).\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 206 chips (103 BB), which is healthy. Others have similar stacks.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 103 BB, I can afford to be patient and wait for better spots. No need to play marginal hands from early position.\n\n6. **Action to come**: There are 4 players left to act behind me (SB, BB, and two others who haven't acted yet). They could raise, making my call even worse.\n\nThis is an easy fold. Even calling 2 chips (1 BB) would be a mistake with this hand from UTG. I should wait for better opportunities.\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to consider otherwise... No, this hand has very little potential even if I hit a pair. T5 offsuit is dominated by any ten, and even if I hit a pair of tens, I'm vulnerable to overcards. The reverse implied odds are poor.\n\nI'll fold."

Let me think through the decision:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 5\u2666 T\u2665 is a very weak hand from UTG. It's offsuit, no high card value, no connectivity. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I have to act first postflop, making it hard to play marginal hands.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop in last 2 hands (6 and 12 chips). They seem aggressive.\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) hasn't shown much aggression preflop.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has raised preflop twice (both to 4 chips).\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 206 chips (103 BB), which is healthy. Others have similar stacks.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 103 BB, I can afford to be patient and wait for better spots. No need to play marginal hands from early position.\n\n6. **Action to come**: There are 4 players left to act behind me (SB, BB, and two others who haven't acted yet). They could raise, making my call even worse.\n\nThis is an easy fold. Even calling 2 chips (1 BB) would be a mistake with this hand from UTG. I should wait for better opportunities.\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to consider otherwise... No, this hand has very little potential even if I hit a pair. T5 offsuit is dominated by any ten, and even if I hit a pair of tens, I'm vulnerable to overcards. The reverse implied odds are poor.\n\nI'll fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm UTG (under the gun) with pocket 9s. This is a medium-strength pocket pair. At 103 BB deep, I have a healthy stack. Being UTG means I have to act first after the blinds, which is a disadvantage. Pocket 9s is borderline for opening UTG - it's playable but needs caution.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot of marginal hands, which is reasonable. The opponents seem to be AI players (Kimi-K2 Thinking, Kimi-K2, MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B). I don't have much specific history on their tendencies yet.\n\nPot odds: need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds preflop. But if I just call, I invite others to come in behind me with better hands.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (103 BB), so I can afford to be somewhat selective. Pocket 9s has good set-mining potential (hitting a 9 on the flop about 12% of the time).\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold - conservative but maybe too tight for pocket 9s\n2. Call - allows others in, could get raised behind me\n3. Raise - standard play with medium pocket pairs, builds pot for set mining, defines hand strength\n\nI think raising is best. It reduces the field, builds the pot for when I hit a set, and I can often take it down preflop if everyone folds. A standard raise would be 3-4x BB, so 6-8 chips total. Since minimum raise is to 4 (2 more), I should raise to 6 or 8.\n\nLet me check typical raise sizes. With 103 BB, raising to 8 (4x) is reasonable. That's 8 total chips, putting in 6 more.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 9s is a playable hand UTG at 103 BB.

          "reasoning_content": "Now let me think about this situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with pocket 9s. I raised to 8 (4x BB). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) 3-bet to 30 from SB. That's a significant 3-bet - they made it 30 total, which is a raise of 22 more to me (since I already put in 8).\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: They folded a lot early (hands 2-8), then started getting more active. They raised to 6 in hand 11 and to 12 in hand 12. This 3-bet to 30 is much larger than their previous raises. This suggests they might have a premium hand.\n\nPot is currently 40 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + my 8 + their 30). I need to call 22 to continue.\n\nMy stack: 198 chips, I already have 8 in, so I have 190 left. If I call, I'll have 168 left.\n\nOpponent stack: 176 chips, they have 30 in, so 146 left.\n\nThis is a tournament situation. Pocket 9s is a medium pair. Against a 3-bet from SB, their range could be wide, but given their sizing (30 total, which is 15x BB), this looks strong. They might have TT+, AK, maybe AQ.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 22 to win 40+22 = 62. That's about 35% pot odds.\n\nEquity of 99 vs a tight range (JJ+, AK): about 40%\nEquity of 99 vs wider range (TT+, AJ+, KQ): about 45%\n\nSo mathematically, calling might be okay if I think they're not super tight. But there are considerations:\n\n1. Position: I'm out of position (they're SB, I'm BB)\n2. Stack sizes: If I call, pot will be 62, and I'll have 168 left (about 2.7x pot). SPR ~2.7, which is awkward for set mining.\n3. Tournament: We're both deep (99 BB effective). Losing 22 chips here isn't devastating, but getting stacked with 99 would be.\n\nGiven the opponent's recent aggression (raising last 2 hands they played) and this large 3-bet size, I'm leaning toward folding. The 3-bet is quite large relative to previous raises (6, 12 to now 30). This feels like strength.\n\nHowever, I could consider a 4-bet bluff or call. But 99 doesn't play great out of position postflop, especially if an overcard comes.\n\nI think folding is prudent here. Let's preserve our stack and wait for better spots. We're not desperate - we have 99 BB.\n\nBut wait, I should check my own history to see if I've been aggressive.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with pocket 9s (9s 9c). My stack is 198 chips (99 BB). The pot is 40 chips. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 30 total after I raised to 8. I need to call 22 more.\n\nFrom opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has made preflop raises of 6 and 12 in previous hands (hands 11 and 12). This 30 raise is much larger. They haven't shown any calling tendencies preflop.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 9s is a medium pocket pair. Against a 3-bet from the SB, this is a tough spot. The pot odds: I need to call 22 to win 40 + 30 = 70 total pot (40 already + his 30 raise). That's 22 to win 70, or about 1:3.2, needing ~31% equity.\n\nAgainst a typical 3-betting range from SB (maybe JJ+, AK, AQ), pocket 9s has about 40-45% equity. Against a tighter range (QQ+, AK), it's about 35-40%. Against a super tight range (KK+, AA), it's about 20%.\n\nGiven the opponent's previous raises were smaller (6 and 12), this large 30 raise suggests strength. However, at 99 BB deep, I have good implied odds if I hit a set on the flop (about 7.5:1 odds to flop a set). Calling 22 with 198 stack gives me position (he's SB, I'm BB postflop).\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack. Folding preserves chips. Calling risks 22 chips (11% of stack) with potential to win more if I hit a set.\n\nThe minimum raise to is 52, which would be a 4-bet. With pocket 9s, 4-betting seems ambitious unless I think he's light. His large 3-bet suggests strength.\n\nI should consider calling to see a flop and potentially stack him if I hit a set. The pot odds are reasonable, and implied odds are good with deep stacks.\n\nHowever, I'm out of position postflop (he acts first on flop). That's a disadvantage.\n\nLet me think: If I call, pot will be 70. My stack remaining: 176. If I miss the flop and he bets, I'll likely have to fold. If I hit a set, I can potentially win his entire 176 stack.\n\nThe risk: 22 chips. The reward: potentially 176 chips. That's 8:1 implied odds, which is good for set mining (need about 7.5:1).\n\nI think calling is reasonable. Folding is also fine to preserve chips. But given the stack depths and tournament, I'll call.\n\nWait, I raised to 8 initially (from BB). He 3-bet to 30. My initial raise was small. He might be punishing my small raise with a wider range.\n\nActually, looking at the action: I raised to 8 from BB after SB posted 1 and BB posted 2. That's a 4x raise (2+8=10 total? Wait: blinds are 1/2. SB posted 1, BB posted 2. I raised to 8 total, which is 6 more than BB's 2. So it's a 3x raise over BB.\n\nHe 3-bet to 30, which is a large sizing.\n\nI'll call.",

The Q and T are both higher than my 9s. My hand is now essentially a pocket pair below the board cards.\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nSeat 1 has shown some aggression:\n- Hand 11: Raised preflop to 6, then checked flop/turn, folded river\n- Hand 12: Raised preflop to 12, bet 16 on flop\n- Hand 14: Checked preflop (as SB), bet 5 on flop\n\nThe 3-bet preflop to 30 is quite large relative to blinds (1/2). This suggests a strong range: likely QQ+, AK, maybe AQ, JJ, TT. The flop bet of 45 into 107 pot (~42% pot) is a continuation bet.\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- I have middle pair (9s) but board has Q and T\n- I need a 9 on turn or river to improve (2 outs)\n- Could also hit a straight draw if board runs out J-8 or 8-7 (unlikely)\n- Essentially I'm playing for set value, but I already missed\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 107 + 45 = 152 if I call\nI need to call 45 to win 152\nPot odds: 45/(152+45) = 45/197 \u2248 22.8%\n\n**Implied odds:**\nIf I hit my set on turn (2 outs \u2248 4.3%), I could potentially win opponent's remaining 86 chips (131 - 45 = 86)\nBut opponent might not pay off if board gets scary\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have 176 chips, opponent has 131. If I call and lose, I'll be at 131 chips. If I fold, I'm at 176 chips. This is a significant portion of my stack.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. The board hits a 3-bettor's range hard (QQ, TT, AQ, KQ all love this flop)\n2. My 9s are likely behind unless opponent has AK/JJ\n3. The bet size (45 into 107) is standard continuation, not necessarily super strong\n4. I have position for the rest of the hand\n5. I'm getting about 3.4:1 pot odds (need ~23% equity)\n\n**Equity estimate:**\nAgainst a 3-bet range of QQ+, AK, AQ, JJ, TT:\n- QQ: I'm crushed (2 outs)\n- KK/AA: I'm crushed (2 outs)  \n- AK: I'm ahead (6 outs for them)\n- AQ: I'm behind (pair of Qs, they have 5 outs)\n- JJ: I'm ahead (2 outs for them)\n- TT: I'm crushed (set)\n\nOverall, I likely have around 25-30% equity against this range. The pot odds of 23% are close. However, there's reverse implied odds - if I'm ahead, I might not get paid much, if I'm behind, I could lose more.\n\nGiven the tournament situation and that I have position but a marginal hand, I think folding is prudent. The 3-bet preflop was large, and the flop continuation suggests strength. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n**Alternative consideration:** If I think opponent is aggressive and could be bluffing with AK, maybe I could call. But with my stack size, it's risky.\n\nI'll fold."

The flop bet of 45 into 107 pot (~42% pot) is a continuation bet.\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- I have middle pair (9s) but board has Q and T\n- I need a 9 on turn or river to improve (2 outs)\n- Could also hit a straight draw if board runs out J-8 or 8-7 (unlikely)\n- Essentially I'm playing for set value, but I already missed\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 107 + 45 = 152 if I call\nI need to call 45 to win 152\nPot odds: 45/(152+45) = 45/197 \u2248 22.8%\n\n**Implied odds:**\nIf I hit my set on turn (2 outs \u2248 4.3%), I could potentially win opponent's remaining 86 chips (131 - 45 = 86)\nBut opponent might not pay off if board gets scary\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have 176 chips, opponent has 131. If I call and lose, I'll be at 131 chips. If I fold, I'm at 176 chips. This is a significant portion of my stack.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. The board hits a 3-bettor's range hard (QQ, TT, AQ, KQ all love this flop)\n2. My 9s are likely behind unless opponent has AK/JJ\n3. The bet size (45 into 107) is standard continuation, not necessarily super strong\n4. I have position for the rest of the hand\n5. I'm getting about 3.4:1 pot odds (need ~23% equity)\n\n**Equity estimate:**\nAgainst a 3-bet range of QQ+, AK, AQ, JJ, TT:\n- QQ: I'm crushed (2 outs)\n- KK/AA: I'm crushed (2 outs)  \n- AK: I'm ahead (6 outs for them)\n- AQ: I'm behind (pair of Qs, they have 5 outs)\n- JJ: I'm ahead (2 outs for them)\n- TT: I'm crushed (set)\n\nOverall, I likely have around 25-30% equity against this range. The pot odds of 23% are close. However, there's reverse implied odds - if I'm ahead, I might not get paid much, if I'm behind, I could lose more.\n\nGiven the tournament situation and that I have position but a marginal hand, I think folding is prudent. The 3-bet preflop was large, and the flop continuation suggests strength. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n**Alternative consideration:** If I think opponent is aggressive and could be bluffing with AK, maybe I could call. But with my stack size, it's risky.\n\nI'll fold.",

The current raise to 6 (3x BB) is relatively small compared to their 15x BB raise in hand #15.\n\n**My Situation:**\n- J9o is a weak hand, especially from out of position\n- I'm getting 9:4 pot odds (2.25:1) to call\n- If I call, the pot will be 13 chips, and I'll have position disadvantage\n- My stack is healthy (87 BB), so I don't need to take marginal spots\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a decent stack, no need to gamble with weak hands\n- Defending BB with J9o against a single raise is marginal at best\n- Against an aggressive opponent, I could consider 3-betting as a bluff, but J9o is too weak for that\n- Folding preserves my stack for better spots\n\n**Decision:**\nJ9o is not a good hand to defend from the BB against a raise. While the pot odds are reasonable (2.25:1), I need around 30% equity to call. J9o vs a typical UTG raising range has maybe 35-40% equity, but that's close. More importantly, I'll be out of position postflop, which reduces my equity realization significantly. Against an aggressive opponent who might barrel multiple streets, this becomes a difficult spot.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better hand in position.",

The Ace gives us some high card value, but 3 is a weak kicker. Being suited adds some flush potential.\n\n**Position considerations:**\nWe're out of position (SB) against a raiser who likely has position on us (Seat 2 is likely UTG or UTG+1 based on the action). Being out of position with a marginal hand is difficult.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nWe need to call 5 to win 14 (9 current pot + our 5 call). That's 5:14 or about 1:2.8, meaning we need ~26% equity. Against a typical raising range, A3s likely has around 30-35% equity, so pot odds are favorable.\n\n**Stack preservation:**\nWe have 86.5 BB, which is healthy. Calling 5 chips (2.5 BB) is a small investment.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nWe want to preserve chips but also accumulate. A3s can flop well (flush draws, ace-high, straight draws).\n\n**Decision:**\nCalling seems reasonable. Folding is also fine given the positional disadvantage. Raising would be aggressive with a marginal hand out of position.\n\nGiven the pot odds and the fact that we have a suited Ace with some potential, I'll call. This allows us to see a flop and potentially hit something strong without committing too many chips.\n\nHowever, I should consider that the opponent has been raising somewhat frequently (40%), which might indicate a wider range. This makes calling more attractive.\n\nI'll call.",

They seem to raise with decent hands but not extremely tight. They folded to 3-bets in some hands.\n\n**Hand strength evaluation:**\n- My A3s has missed the flop completely\n- I have Ace-high, which might be good if opponent has missed\n- I have backdoor flush draw (clubs) and backdoor straight potential\n- Paired board means opponent could have trips or full house\n\n**Pot odds and decision:**\n- Pot is 14 chips, no bet to call\n- I can check, raise, or fold\n- Checking seems standard with Ace-high on this board\n- Raising could be a bluff if I think opponent will fold\n- Folding seems too weak given I have position and some backdoor equity\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 84 BB, healthy stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks\n- But also need to accumulate chips\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check and see what opponent does. My hand has some showdown value if opponent checks behind, and I have backdoor draws. Raising here with Ace-high on a paired board seems too aggressive and could get me into trouble if opponent has a Jack or better. Checking allows me to realize equity cheaply.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking with Ace-high on paired board. Have backdoor flush and straight draws.

They seem to be playing a typical TAG style - raising with decent hands, folding weak ones. No postflop data available as they've mostly folded preflop or we don't have showdown info.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have ace-high with a weak kicker on a double paired board\n- The board is Jd 8d Jc 8c - very dry except for diamond draws\n- My hand has no flush draw (clubs and diamonds on board, I have Ac and 3c)\n- My only real chance is to bluff or catch an ace on river\n- The double paired board makes it less likely opponent has a strong hand unless they have Jx or 8x\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1. I'm out of position (BB vs UTG+1 raiser)\n2. Pot is small (14 chips)\n3. Opponent checked back flop, suggesting weakness or a draw\n4. On a double paired board, many hands missed\n5. My ace-high might be the best hand given opponent's flop check\n6. I could try a small bet to take it down now\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: See a free river, but gives opponent chance to bluff or improve\n- **Bet**: Try to take down pot now with a small bet (4-6 chips)\n\nGiven the small pot and my positional disadvantage, I think a small bet is reasonable. If opponent has a weak hand like 99-TT or a missed draw, they might fold. If they call or raise, I can easily give up on river.\n\nI'll bet small - 4 chips (minimum raise) to keep pressure while risking minimal chips."

They seem to be playing a typical TAG style - raising with decent hands, folding weak ones. No postflop data available as they've mostly folded preflop or we don't have showdown info.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have ace-high with a weak kicker on a double paired board\n- The board is Jd 8d Jc 8c - very dry except for diamond draws\n- My hand has no flush draw (clubs and diamonds on board, I have Ac and 3c)\n- My only real chance is to bluff or catch an ace on river\n- The double paired board makes it less likely opponent has a strong hand unless they have Jx or 8x\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1. I'm out of position (BB vs UTG+1 raiser)\n2. Pot is small (14 chips)\n3. Opponent checked back flop, suggesting weakness or a draw\n4. On a double paired board, many hands missed\n5. My ace-high might be the best hand given opponent's flop check\n6. I could try a small bet to take it down now\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: See a free river, but gives opponent chance to bluff or improve\n- **Bet**: Try to take down pot now with a small bet (4-6 chips)\n\nGiven the small pot and my positional disadvantage, I think a small bet is reasonable. If opponent has a weak hand like 99-TT or a missed draw, they might fold. If they call or raise, I can easily give up on river.\n\nI'll bet small - 4 chips (minimum raise) to keep pressure while risking minimal chips.",

Pot odds: 3:2 or 1.5:1, which is decent for speculative hand.\n\nGiven my position and opponent tendencies, I could consider a small raise to try to take the pot down preflop or build a pot with initiative. Minimum raise is to 4 total (2 more). However, with suited connectors, I often prefer to see a cheap flop and play postflop.\n\nConsidering tournament: I have 91 BB, not desperate. 87s is marginal but playable from button. The blinds are tight, so they might fold to a raise. But if they call, I'm out of position postflop (except against BB if SB folds).\n\nBetter to call and see a flop. If I hit a draw or pair, I can continue. If not, I can fold. The cost is minimal (2 chips = 1 BB).\n\nLet's call."

Seems tight.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has folded 8 of 10 preflop actions, raised once (hand 12), but generally tight.\n\nBoth blinds appear to be playing tight, folding most hands. From the button, 87s has good implied odds if I hit a strong draw or hand. I have 91 BB stack, which is healthy.\n\nThe pot is 3 chips (SB+BB). I need to call 2 chips to see a flop. That's 1 BB. Pot odds: 3:2 or 1.5:1, which is decent for speculative hand.\n\nGiven my position and opponent tendencies, I could consider a small raise to try to take the pot down preflop or build a pot with initiative. Minimum raise is to 4 total (2 more). However, with suited connectors, I often prefer to see a cheap flop and play postflop.\n\nConsidering tournament: I have 91 BB, not desperate. 87s is marginal but playable from button. The blinds are tight, so they might fold to a raise. But if they call, I'm out of position postflop (except against BB if SB folds).\n\nBetter to call and see a flop. If I hit a draw or pair, I can continue. If not, I can fold. The cost is minimal (2 chips = 1 BB).\n\nLet's call.",

A bet could get folds from weak hands, especially since the flop has a King which might have missed many hands.\n\nHowever, the pot is small, and I'm not in a rush to build a big pot with a draw. Checking back gives me a free card and keeps the pot small, which might be good since I'm not strong yet.\n\nBut considering tournament dynamics and stack sizes (I have 180 chips, opponent has 180 chips), a small bet could be good. If I bet 2-3 chips (40-60% pot), I can apply pressure and potentially win the pot now.\n\nLooking at my history, I recently won a hand with a turn bet after checking flop. But here I have position and a draw.\n\nI think a small bet is reasonable as a semi-bluff. Let's bet 3 chips (60% pot). This puts pressure on opponent and builds the pot if I hit. If called, I still have good equity.\n\nActually, wait - I should check the opponent's tendencies more. They folded on the flop in hand 12 when facing action. They might be tight.

A bet could get folds from weak hands, especially since the flop has a King which might have missed many hands.\n\nHowever, the pot is small, and I'm not in a rush to build a big pot with a draw. Checking back gives me a free card and keeps the pot small, which might be good since I'm not strong yet.\n\nBut considering tournament dynamics and stack sizes (I have 180 chips, opponent has 180 chips), a small bet could be good. If I bet 2-3 chips (40-60% pot), I can apply pressure and potentially win the pot now.\n\nLooking at my history, I recently won a hand with a turn bet after checking flop. But here I have position and a draw.\n\nI think a small bet is reasonable as a semi-bluff. Let's bet 3 chips (60% pot). This puts pressure on opponent and builds the pot if I hit. If called, I still have good equity.\n\nActually, wait - I should check the opponent's tendencies more. They folded on the flop in hand 12 when facing action. They might be tight. A bet could take it down.\n\nI'll go with a small raise.",

Bet: Semi-bluff, could win pot now, build pot if hit\n\nGiven opponent folded on flop previously when facing action, and seems tight, a small bet might win the pot. But the pot is small, so risk/reward: betting 3 chips to win 5 chips. If I get called, I have good equity (around 32% for straight draw plus some backdoor flush).\n\nBut actually, I should consider tournament stack sizes. We both have 180 chips (90 BB).

The pot is offering me 10:0 odds to check (since amount to call is 0).\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown some aggression (raises preflop in hands 15 and 16, bet on flop in hand 14 and 15). However, in this hand they just limped (called) from UTG. This could indicate a weaker hand. They've folded preflop in several recent hands (17, 18, 19).\n\n**Position**: I'm out of position (BB vs UTG). This is a disadvantage postflop.\n\n**Stack sizes**: I have 181 chips, opponent has 237 chips. Both are deep stacked (45+ BB).\n\n**Tournament considerations**: At 45 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands.\n\n**Decision**: With A2o out of position against a limper, the standard play is to check and see a flop. Raising would be aggressive but could isolate a weak limper. However, A2o doesn't play well postflop, especially out of position. Checking is the most reasonable play.\n\nChecking allows me to see a flop cheaply. If I hit an Ace, I can proceed cautiously. If I miss completely, I can fold. The pot odds are excellent (free to check).\n\nI should check and see the flop."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\nHand: As 2d\nBoard: 8h 3c 5c 6c\n\nI have Ace-high with a gutshot straight draw (need a 4 for a straight: 2-3-4-5-6). I also have a backdoor flush draw with the Ac (though only one club in my hand). The board is 8h 3c 5c 6c - three clubs on board, so there's a flush possibility.\n\nI'm in the BB with 181 chips (45.2 BB). The pot is 10 chips. It's the turn, and the action is on me. Amount to call is 0.\n\nLooking at opponent actions: Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) is the only opponent left in the hand. From the recall, they seem to be an active player - they've raised preflop several times, bet on flops, and in hand #20 they bet 4 on the turn. They checked the flop this hand though.\n\nMy hand has some potential: \n- Gutshot straight draw (4 outs)\n- Ace overcard (3 outs if opponent doesn't have an Ace)\n- Backdoor flush potential (though weak with only Ac)\n\nHowever, the board is coordinated with three clubs, so there's flush danger. My opponent checked the flop, which could mean they have a weak hand or are slow-playing something strong.\n\nGiven the small pot (10 chips) and my marginal hand, I think the best play is to check and see a free river. If I hit my straight or an Ace, I can consider betting. If not, I can fold to any bet.\n\nI have position (BB acting first on turn), but the opponent checked flop, so they might check again on turn.\n\nLet me check: Board is 8h 3c 5c 6c. The straight draw is to 7 (for 4-5-6-7-8) or 4 (for 2-3-4-5-6). Actually, I have 2-3-5-6-8 on board with my A2. I need a 4 for a straight: 2-3-4-5-6. That's 4 outs. The 7 would give me 5-6-7-8 with my A2, not a straight. So yes, 4 outs to a straight.\n\nGiven the small pot and marginal draw, checking seems correct. I'll check to see a free river.",

The board is 8h 3c 5c 6c Kc. This is a four-club board with a straight possibility (4-5-6-7-8, though 7 would complete it). My hand has:\n- Ace-high only\n- No pair\n- No flush (I have As 2d, no club)\n- No straight (I need a 4 or 7 for straight)\n- Basically just Ace-high with no draw\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall, Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown:\n- Aggressive tendencies with raises preflop and bets on flop\n- In hand #20, they bet 4 on the turn\n- They limped preflop this hand (just called from UTG)\n- They checked flop and turn\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe river brought Kc, making four clubs on board. This is a scary card that completes many draws:\n- Flush draws got there\n- Straight draws with 7c would have flush too\n- Kc pairs the king\n\n**Pot Analysis:**\nPot is only 10 chips. Very small pot relative to stacks.\n\n**My Position:**\nI'm in BB, checked through flop and turn. Opponent checked behind both streets. This suggests neither of us has a strong hand.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the board texture and my weak hand (just Ace-high), I should check and hope to win at showdown. The Kc on river likely didn't help my opponent either since they checked turn. They might have a weak hand too. If I bet, I risk being raised or called by a better hand. With just 10 chips in the pot, not worth bluffing.\n\nThe opponent has shown aggression in other hands but checked this one twice. They likely have a weak hand as well. Ace-high might be good here.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I have 45 BB, healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks for 10 chips.\n\nI'll check and hope my Ace-high wins."

I'm facing just the blinds - SB (Seat 4) and BB (Seat 5). I need to call 4 chips to see the flop, or I can raise.\n\nMy stack is 189 chips (47.2 BB), which is healthy. The BB (Seat 5) has shown some aggression preflop - I can see from the recall that they've raised in 3 hands. They seem to be somewhat active.\n\nA8o is a marginal hand from the button. It's not great, but it has some value in position against blinds. The ace gives me some high card strength, but the 8 is a weak kicker.\n\nGiven my position (button) and that both players have folded to me, this is a good spot to either raise or call. Raising would be standard to apply pressure on the blinds. However, I should consider:\n\n1. A8o plays better as a raise than a call - I can win the pot preflop or play in position with initiative.\n2. The BB has shown aggression, so they might defend more often.\n3. My stack is healthy, so I can afford to play this hand.\n\nLooking at the recall data: Seat 5 (BB) has raised preflop 3 times, which suggests they might be somewhat aggressive. But they're in the BB now, so they already have money in the pot and might defend.\n\nI think a small raise is appropriate here. I'll raise to 8 chips total (which is a min-raise from 4 to 8). This gives me positional advantage and allows me to potentially win the pot preflop.\n\nLet me calculate: If I raise to 8, that's putting in 4 more chips. The pot would be 14 (6 current + 8 from me). The blinds would need to call 4 (SB) and 0 (BB) more respectively.\n\nActually wait, the BB already has 4 in, so they'd need to call 4 more. The SB has 2 in, so they'd need to call 6 more.\n\nA min-raise should be fine here. Let me check if there are any other considerations... My win rate is 27% from 22 hands, which is reasonable. I've won a couple hands recently.\n\nI think raising is better than calling because:\n1. I have position\n2. A8o benefits from initiative\n3. I can potentially win preflop\n4. If called, I have position postflop\n\nI'll go with a min-raise.",

The board is low and dry, my preflop raise represents strength, and opponent has shown tendency to fold on flop. A small bet of 8-10 chips (less than half pot) should take it down often.\n\nLet me check the minimum raise: it says minimum raise to 4, but that's confusing because amount to call is 0. Actually, I think I can bet any amount from 4 up to my stack. I'll bet 8 chips (raise_to would be 8 total, but since amount to call is 0, I think \"raise\" means bet here). Wait, actually \"raise_to\" is total amount in pot. Since nothing to call, if I bet 8, raise_to should be 8.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Standard continuation bet on dry low board with position.

From UTG (under the gun, first to act), this is an easy fold in most poker strategies. The hand has very little potential to make strong hands postflop. Even if I hit a pair, it's a weak pair with Ten kicker.\n\nLooking at the table dynamics: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) folded, so I'm the first to act preflop. There are still 3 players behind me who haven't acted: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2), Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B), and Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) in the big blind. \n\nFrom the opponent data, I see that in hand #22, Kimi-K2 raised to 8 from what appears to be UTG+1 position, showing some aggression. In hand #23, GPT-OSS-120B called from the small blind and then folded on the flop. I don't have much data on opponents' tendencies yet, but that's okay.\n\nMy stack is 199 chips (49.8 BB), which is healthy. I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots. Playing Th3o from UTG would likely put me in difficult spots postflop, especially with multiple players left to act who could raise behind me.\n\nThe amount to call is 4 chips (the big blind), but calling with this hand would be poor. I'd be out of position for the rest of the hand with a weak holding. Raising would be even worse - I'd be building a pot with a terrible hand.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and stack preservation considerations, the clear decision is to fold. I'll wait for a better hand in a better position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Th3o is extremely weak from UTG position.

It's one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\nI have 199 chips (49.8 BB) which is a decent stack. The blinds are 2/4. I need to call 4 chips to see the flop from UTG.\n\nLet me think about the position: UTG is the worst position to play from, especially with a weak hand. There are 4 players left to act after me (MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB). \n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been playing fairly passively (checking/calling)\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised once in hand 22 but otherwise folded preflop\n\nMy own hand history shows I've been folding weak hands from early positions, which is correct.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6 chips (after my call, pot would be 10). That's 1:1.5 odds, or 40% pot odds. But with 3h 6d, my equity against random hands is terrible - probably around 25-30% at best.\n\nImplied odds: Even if I hit something like a pair of 6s or 3s, it's a weak pair that's vulnerable to overcards. I could hit two pair or trips, but those are long shots.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 49.8 BB, which is healthy. There's no need to gamble with such a weak hand from UTG.

Out of position with marginal hand, better to preserve stack. Opponent has shown aggressive raising tendencies, but even against wide range, this hand doesn't play well postflop.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with Jh7s, facing a raise to 14 from UTG (Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking). The pot is 20 (4 from BB, 2 from SB, 14 from UTG), and I need to call 10 more.\n\nLet me think about this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Jh7s is a weak hand. Offsuit, not connected, not suited. This is a clear folding hand against a raise from UTG.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position (BB vs UTG), which makes playing this hand even worse.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the search results, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising preflop in various positions. In hand #16, they raised to 6 from UTG. In hand #12, they raised to 12. In hand #15, they raised to 30. So they have an aggressive raising range. Their current raise to 14 (3.5x BB) is a standard raise size.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 195 chips (48.8 BB). Calling 10 chips would be 5.1% of my stack. While not huge, I'm playing a weak hand out of position.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 20, need to call 10, so getting 2:1 odds. However, with such a weak hand, I need much better implied odds to continue, and I'm out of position.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (48.8 BB). No need to gamble with marginal hands.\n\n7. **Alternatives**: I could consider a 3-bet bluff, but Jh7s is too weak for that, especially against an UTG raise. Folding is the standard play.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been playing reasonably tight. In hand #16, I folded J9s from BB to a UTG raise of 6.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My hand: Ah 6d (ace-six offsuit)\n- My position: SB (small blind)\n- My stack: 193 chips (48.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 18 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise)\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 in seat 2 raised to 12 total\n- Amount to call: 10 (since I already posted 2 as SB)\n- Minimum raise to: 20 total\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nA6o is a marginal hand, especially from the SB facing a raise. The ace is good, but the 6 kicker is weak. This hand plays better as a call in position rather than out of position.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the recall data, Kimi-K2 has:\n- Mostly folded preflop (7 out of 10 actions were folds)\n- One raise action in hand #22 (raised to 8)\n- No showdowns recorded\nThis suggests Kimi-K2 is playing tight, so their raising range is likely strong.\n\n**Position consideration:**\nI'm in the SB, which is the worst position postflop. I'll have to act first on every street, making it difficult to realize equity and control the pot.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 18 chips\n- To call: 10 chips\n- Pot odds: 10/(18+10) = 10/28 \u2248 35.7%\nI need ~36% equity to call. Against a tight raising range from a tight player, A6o likely has less than 36% equity.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- My stack: 193 chips (48.2 BB)\n- Opponent stack: 186 chips (46.5 BB)\n- If I call, pot will be 28 chips preflop, which is ~15% of my stack. This commits me somewhat but not completely.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have an average stack (48 BB). There's no need to take marginal spots out of position against a tight player.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n1. Fold - Preserve chips, avoid playing marginal hand OOP\n2. Call - See flop with ace-high, but likely dominated\n3. Raise - Could 3-bet bluff, but A6o is not a good candidate and we have no fold equity read\n\nGiven Kimi-K2's tight tendencies and my poor position, folding is the correct play. A6o doesn't have enough equity against a tight raising range, and playing OOP with a weak ace is a recipe for losing chips.\n\nI should wait for better spots in better position.",

This is a very weak hand from early position. K4o has poor playability postflop - if I hit a king, I'm often dominated by better kickers. The 4 is a terrible kicker. The hand is offsuit, so no flush potential.\n\nMy stack is 199 chips (49.8 BB), which is healthy. Blinds are 2/4. I need to call 4 chips to see the flop. Pot is currently 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4). After my call, pot would be 10 chips.\n\nHowever, I'm UTG with 3 players left to act: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4), GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, SB), and Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, BB). Given that MiniMax-M2 has been folding every hand, they might fold again. But GPT-OSS-120B in SB and Kimi-K2 Thinking in BB could raise, putting me in a difficult spot.\n\nEven if I just call and see the flop, with K4o I'll often be in tricky situations postflop. The hand has very little potential to make strong hands. Best case is hitting two pair or trips, but that's unlikely.\n\nTournament strategy: With 50 BB, I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots. Playing K4o from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\nPot odds: 4 to win 10 (2.5:1) but with such a weak hand and bad position, the implied odds are poor.\n\nGiven all this, folding is clearly the best decision. I'll respond with the JSON format.",

I'm in the big blind (I posted 4). So I need to call 4 more to stay in the pot (total 8). The pot is currently: SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 8 + call 8 = 22 chips. I need to call 4 to win 22, giving me 5.5:1 pot odds.\n\nMy hand J9o is marginal, especially from the BB facing a raise and a call. However, I'm on the button, which gives me positional advantage postflop. With 5.5:1 odds, I can call with many hands. But I should consider opponent tendencies.\n\nFrom the data: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has no recorded raises in my limited data, but that's just small sample. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has called preflop multiple times with weak hands like 2s5s, 6c7d, 8d7s. So seat 5 is a loose caller. Seat 4's raise could be a wide range given seat 5 is loose.\n\nMy stack is 195 chips (48.8 BB). Calling 4 chips is only 2% of my stack. However, I'm out of position for the rest of the hand (actually wait: I'm on the button, but I'm in the BB this hand? Let me check: \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\" but \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 4\". So I'm the button but posting BB because button rotates. So I'm out of position for this hand (BB). That's worse.\n\nGiven I'm out of position with J9o, facing a raise and a call, I should probably fold. The pot odds are good but positional disadvantage is significant. Also J9o doesn't play well multi-way out of position. I could consider raising to isolate, but with a marginal hand and out of position, that's risky.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for better spots.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this hand. I'm on the button with 3c 2d, which is an absolutely terrible hand - one of the worst possible starting hands. The opponent in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 12 chips (3x BB). Looking at the opponent's history, I can see:\n\n1. In the last 4 hands (26-29), GPT-OSS-120B folded preflop every time.\n2. In hand 30, they raised to 12 preflop, then checked on flop, turn, and river.\n3. In hand 31, they called 8 preflop, then folded on the flop.\n\nSo they've shown some aggression in hand 30 with a raise, but then checked down the whole hand. This could indicate they had a speculative hand or were trying to steal. They have 142 chips (35.5 BB), which is a medium stack.\n\nMy stack is 193 chips (48.2 BB), so I have a decent stack. The pot is 18 chips, and I need to call 10 chips to continue. That's about 5.5% of my stack.\n\nHowever, with 32o, this is an easy fold. The hand has almost no playability postflop - it's not suited, not connected, and has very low cards. Even if I hit a pair, it's a weak bottom pair that's vulnerable. The only reasonable flop would be something like 2-3-5 for a straight draw, but even then it's a gutshot.\n\nPositionally, being on the button is good, but with such a terrible hand, I shouldn't be playing it. The raiser is in early position (seat 5 is UTG?), actually looking at the table: Seat 5 is UTG? Let me check the positions: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded, I'm Seat 3 (BTN), Seat 4 is BB, Seat 5 is UTG? Actually with 5 players, positions would be: SB (Seat 3? Wait I'm BTN), BB (Seat 4), UTG (Seat 5), MP (Seat 1), CO (Seat 2). So the raiser is UTG, which makes their range stronger.\n\nUTG raising range should be fairly tight. With 32o, I'm dominated by almost any hand they could have. Even if they're bluffing, I have no way to know and my hand can't stand much pressure postflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 10 to win 28 (18 current pot + 10 my call). That's about 35.7% equity needed. 32o has about 32% equity against a random hand, but against a UTG raising range, it's much worse. Against a tight range like 22+, A2s+, A7o+, K9s+, KTo+, QTs+, QJo, JTs, my equity is only about 24%.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack and should preserve it. No need to gamble with trash hands.\n\nThe BB (Seat 4) still has to act after me, so there's additional risk of a squeeze.\n\nEasy fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 2s4s, which is a very weak hand - 2-4 suited. However, I'm in late position (button) with only the blinds left to act. Looking at opponent tendencies:\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has mostly folded preflop (7 out of 10 times), but raised once in hand 31 and bet the flop. Shows some aggression occasionally.\n\nSeat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised twice preflop (hands 30 and 32), called once (hand 31), and folded several times. Shows more aggression than seat 4.\n\nMy stack is 193 chips (48.2 BB), which is healthy. The blinds are 2/4, so I need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\nWith 2-4 suited, this is a speculative hand that can make flushes and straights, but it's very weak preflop. Being on the button against only the blinds, this could be a good spot to steal or see a cheap flop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6 (pot is 6), so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds, which is decent. However, the hand is so weak that I'm likely dominated by any pair or better cards.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack (48 BB), so I don't need to take big risks. However, being on the button is a great position to apply pressure.\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies - both blinds have shown they can fold preflop (especially seat 4 who folds a lot), I could consider a raise to try to steal the blinds. But with 2-4 suited, that's risky because if called, I'm likely way behind.\n\nBetter to either fold or call for cheap. Folding is the safe play. Calling for 4 chips (2% of my stack) to see a flop in position isn't terrible, but the hand is so weak that even if I hit a pair, it's bottom pair.\n\nI think folding is the correct play here. Save my chips for better spots. Let me check if there are any other factors... I have position, but the hand is just too weak to play.\n\nActually, wait - I should consider that both opponents have shown some aggression, so they might defend their blinds more. Seat 5 raised last hand (hand 32) from the BB when it folded to him. So he might be defending.\n\nI'll fold.",

Seems active and aggressive.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Only 1 recorded raise preflop (hand 31: 8).\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop frequently (6 times), often with small raises (4 chips) and sometimes larger (12 chips). Shows some aggression.\n\nI'm in UTG position, which is early position. With pocket tens, I should raise to build the pot and narrow the field. Since I have 48 BB, a standard raise would be 3-4x BB, so 12-16 chips. The minimum raise is to 8 chips (just 2x BB), but that's too small.\n\nI should consider raising to around 12-14 chips (3-3.5x BB). This is a reasonable size from UTG with a medium pocket pair. It will likely get folds from weaker hands and potentially get calls from speculative hands, which is fine since I have position on the blinds.\n\nIf I just call, I let too many players in cheaply, and my hand becomes more vulnerable to overcards. Raising is definitely the right play.\n\nLet me check if there are any particular patterns from opponents when facing raises from UTG. Let me search for \"UTG raise\" or similar."

My stack is 193 chips (48.2 BB), which is healthy but not huge.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has raised preflop multiple times (hand 11: 6, hand 12: 12, hand 15: 30, hand 16: 6, hand 26: 14). Seems active and aggressive.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Only 1 recorded raise preflop (hand 31: 8).\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop frequently (6 times), often with small raises (4 chips) and sometimes larger (12 chips). Shows some aggression.\n\nI'm in UTG position, which is early position. With pocket tens, I should raise to build the pot and narrow the field. Since I have 48 BB, a standard raise would be 3-4x BB, so 12-16 chips. The minimum raise is to 8 chips (just 2x BB), but that's too small.\n\nI should consider raising to around 12-14 chips (3-3.5x BB). This is a reasonable size from UTG with a medium pocket pair. It will likely get folds from weaker hands and potentially get calls from speculative hands, which is fine since I have position on the blinds.\n\nIf I just call, I let too many players in cheaply, and my hand becomes more vulnerable to overcards. Raising is definitely the right play.\n\nLet me check if there are any particular patterns from opponents when facing raises from UTG. Let me search for \"UTG raise\" or similar.",

It has virtually no playability, especially from UTG.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position to play marginal hands from, as I have to act first post-flop with 4 players left to act behind me.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 199 chips (49.8 BB) is healthy, but not so deep that I can afford to play speculative hands from bad position.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (7 of last 8 hands folded preflop)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Also folding frequently, but did call once with T6s\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression with raises and bets post-flop\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop multiple times, seems active\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack, I should preserve it for better spots. Playing 84o from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I'd need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. However, with such a weak hand, I'm unlikely to win unless I hit a miracle flop, and even then I could be dominated.\n\nGiven all this analysis, this is an easy fold. I should wait for a better spot with position or a stronger hand.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been playing too tight or loose."

Let me think through this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 4h 8s is one of the worst possible starting hands in poker. It's offsuit, low cards, no connectivity. It has virtually no playability, especially from UTG.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position to play marginal hands from, as I have to act first post-flop with 4 players left to act behind me.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 199 chips (49.8 BB) is healthy, but not so deep that I can afford to play speculative hands from bad position.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (7 of last 8 hands folded preflop)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Also folding frequently, but did call once with T6s\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression with raises and bets post-flop\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop multiple times, seems active\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack, I should preserve it for better spots. Playing 84o from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I'd need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. However, with such a weak hand, I'm unlikely to win unless I hit a miracle flop, and even then I could be dominated.\n\nGiven all this analysis, this is an easy fold. I should wait for a better spot with position or a stronger hand.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been playing too tight or loose.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with 22. The SB folded, and UTG (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) just limped in (called the BB). The pot is 10 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 4 limp). I have 195 chips (48.8 BB). My options are fold, check, or raise.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has folded 9 out of 10 recent actions, with only one raise in hand #26 preflop. They seem fairly tight/passive. They just limped UTG, which suggests a weak to medium hand.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 2s is a small pocket pair. In heads-up situation from BB vs UTG limper, this is a decent spot. Small pocket pairs have good implied odds if we hit a set (about 1 in 8.5 chance). However, we're out of position which is a disadvantage.\n\nStack sizes: I have 195 chips (48.8 BB), opponent has 233 chips (58.3 BB). Pot is 10 chips.\n\nIf I check, I see a flop for free. If I raise, I can try to take the pot down preflop or build a bigger pot for when I hit a set. A standard raise would be to 12-16 chips (3-4x BB).\n\nGiven the opponent's tight tendencies (lots of folds), a raise might get them to fold, winning the 10-chip pot immediately. Even if they call, I have position disadvantage but decent implied odds if I hit a set.\n\nHowever, raising with 22 out of position against a limper can be tricky. If I get called, I'll be playing a small pair out of position on most flops that don't contain a 2.\n\nLet me consider tournament dynamics: I have 48.8 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take big risks. The pot is only 10 chips.\n\nActually, checking seems reasonable here. I get to see a flop for free with a hand that needs to improve. If I hit a set on the flop, I can potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold to any aggression.\n\nRaising might be better if I think the opponent will fold often, but given they limped UTG (showing some interest), they might call with a wide range.\n\nLet me check: I'm getting infinite pot odds to check (0 to call). If I raise to say 12, I'm risking 8 more chips to win 10, needing fold equity > 44% for immediate profit. With opponent's fold-heavy tendencies, this might be good.\n\nBut actually, looking at the data again: In hand #26, they raised preflop. That's their only non-fold action. They've folded 9/10 times. But they just limped this hand, which is unusual for their pattern. Maybe they have a hand they want to see a flop with.\n\nI think checking is the conservative, correct play with 22 from BB against a limper. We take a free flop, hope to hit a set, and minimize risk. If we miss, we can fold easily.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 22 has good implied odds if we hit a set (\u224812.5% chance).

Preflop action: SB posted 2, I posted BB 4, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called, SB folded, I checked. So heads-up against Kimi-K2 Thinking who called from UTG? Actually Seat 1 is UTG? Let's see: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, Seat 2 is SB, Seat 3 is me (BB), Seat 4 is Button, Seat 5 is CO? Wait, typical 5-handed: Seat 1 UTG, Seat 2 SB, Seat 3 BB, Seat 4 Button, Seat 5 CO? Actually with 5 players: Button is Seat 4, CO is Seat 5, UTG is Seat 1, SB is Seat 2, BB is me. Yes.\n\nSo preflop: UTG called, SB folded, I checked. So I have pocket deuces. The flop is Jd As 8h. This is a terrible flop for pocket deuces. There's an Ace and a Jack, both overcards. I have bottom pair, but the Ace is a big overcard. UTG called preflop from UTG, which could be a wide range but likely includes many hands that hit this flop: AJ, A8, maybe suited connectors, maybe small pairs. They could have an Ace, a Jack, maybe a draw. My hand is weak.\n\nI need to decide whether to check or raise. I have position? Actually I'm BB, UTG is first to act postflop? Wait, postflop action: The flop is dealt, and now action starts with the first player after the button. The button is Seat 4 (folded). So first to act is Seat 5 (folded), then Seat 1 (UTG), then me (BB). Actually after button, the order is SB (folded), BB (me), UTG (Seat 1). Wait, typical order: Button acts last. So after flop, action starts with the first active player to the left of the button. Button is Seat 4 (folded). So next is Seat 5 (folded), then Seat 1 (UTG), then Seat 2 (SB folded), then me (BB). So UTG acts before me. But the prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check, raise\". That suggests it's my action now. Maybe UTG checked? The prompt doesn't show flop actions yet. It says \"Actions this hand:\" only shows preflop actions. So flop actions haven't happened yet. So I need to act first? Actually I'm BB, and UTG called preflop, so there are two players: UTG and me. Postflop, the first to act is the player closest to the left of the button. Button is Seat 4 (folded). So first active player is Seat 5 (folded), then Seat 1 (UTG). So UTG acts first. But maybe the prompt is showing that it's my action because UTG checked? The prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\". That means no bet facing me. So UTG must have checked. So I can check or raise.\n\nThus I should decide whether to bet or check. With bottom pair on a board with an Ace, likely UTG has an Ace sometimes. But they called preflop from UTG, which could be a wide range including small pairs, suited connectors, maybe some Ax hands. They might have an Ace, but they might also have a hand like 99-TT, maybe KQ, etc. If they have an Ace, they'll likely call or raise. If they have a weaker hand, they might fold.\n\nMy hand is weak but I have a pair. I could try to bet to represent an Ace and get folds from weaker hands. However, my stack is 195 chips (48.8 BB). The pot is 10 chips. A bet of maybe 5-8 chips could be reasonable. But if I get called, I'm likely behind. I have backdoor straight draws? Not really. Backdoor flush draw? I have 2d, board has Jd, so I have a backdoor diamond flush draw. That's something.\n\nI should consider opponent tendencies. Let's use recall_opponent_actions to see how Kimi-K2 Thinking plays.

They seem tight, folding many hands preflop. They called preflop this hand (hand 36). That suggests they have a decent hand, maybe medium pair, suited connectors, or maybe Ax suited. They didn't raise, so probably not premium like AA, KK, QQ, maybe not AK. Could be AJ, AT, maybe 99-TT, maybe suited connectors like JTs, 89s.\n\nGiven they called from UTG, their range is somewhat strong but not raising strong. On this flop with A J 8, they could have hit an Ace, a Jack, maybe a draw. My pocket deuces are likely behind. However, they might have missed entirely with hands like KQ, QT, T9, etc. If they have a small pair like 99-TT, they might be scared of the Ace.\n\nI could try a small bet to take the pot down. Pot is 10 chips. A bet of 6 chips (half pot) might get folds from hands that missed. If they call, I can reevaluate on turn. But if they raise, I'll have to fold.\n\nMy stack is 195 chips, so I have room to maneuver. However, I'm out of position (they act after me on future streets). That's a disadvantage. Actually wait: I'm BB, they are UTG. Postflop, the order is: UTG acts first, then me. But UTG checked, so now I act. If I bet, they will act after me. So I'm in position for this street? Actually after flop, UTG checked, I can bet, then UTG decides. So I'm last to act on this street, which is good. But on turn and river, the order will be UTG first, then me (since button is folded). So I'll be out of position on future streets. That's bad.\n\nGiven my weak hand and being out of position, maybe checking is better. I can see a free turn card. If turn is a 2, I improve to trips. If turn is a diamond, I get flush draw. Otherwise, I can fold if they bet.\n\nChecking seems reasonable. Let's also search for similar situations. Use search_observations for \"pocket deuces\" or \"22 flop\". But time is limited.\n\nI think checking is fine. I'll check and see what opponent does. If they bet on turn, I can fold. If they check, I can maybe bet on turn if I improve or if board gets scarier.\n\nThus I'll check.",

Our hand is too weak to value bet, and checking allows potential bluff on river if opponent shows weakness.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this situation. We're at the turn with pocket deuces (2d 2c) on a board of Jd As 8h 9d. The pot is only 10 chips. We're in the BB, and the only opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking in seat 1 who limped preflop and checked the flop.\n\nFrom the opponent data I recalled, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding a lot preflop (folded 8 of the last 10 actions). The only raise was hand 26 preflop, and the only other non-fold was hand 25 where they folded on the flop. This suggests they're playing tight/passive.\n\nOur hand is pocket deuces - we have bottom pair but it's a very weak pair on this board. The board has Ace high with J, 8, 9. There's a straight draw possibility (T-Q for a straight), and a flush draw with diamonds (we have 2d, so we have a backdoor diamond draw).\n\nThe pot is tiny (10 chips). We're first to act on the turn. We could:\n1. Check and see what opponent does\n2. Bet small to try to take down the pot\n\nGiven opponent's tight/passive tendencies, they likely have a weak hand if they just limped preflop and checked flop. They might have a small pocket pair, suited connectors, or weak Ace. They might fold to any bet.\n\nHowever, our hand is also very weak. We're essentially bluffing if we bet. But the pot is small, and we have position (we act after them on the river if we check now).\n\nActually, wait - I need to check the action order. We're in BB, they're in seat 1. On the turn, we act first since we're OOP. So if we check, they get to act last on both turn and river.\n\nGiven the small pot and our weak hand, checking seems reasonable. We can see if they bet, and if they do, we can fold. If they check behind, we get a free river card and might improve to trips or a backdoor flush.\n\nBut actually, we have a very weak pair. If we bet and they call, we're likely behind. If we check and they bet, we'll have to fold. So maybe a small bet could take it down.\n\nLet me think about pot odds. If we bet 4 chips (minimum), we're risking 4 to win 10, so we need them to fold 28.6% of the time (4/(10+4)). Given their tight/passive play, they might fold a lot.\n\nBut if they call, we're likely behind and have only 2 outs to improve (two remaining deuces). That's about 4% chance to hit trips on river.\n\nActually, wait - we also have a backdoor flush draw with the 2d. That's about 4% additional equity. So total ~8% chance to improve on river.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, we have 48.8 BB stack, which is healthy. No need to take big risks.\n\nI think checking is the best play. We keep the pot small, get to see a free river, and can evaluate then. If opponent bets, we can easily fold our weak hand.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: The opponent limped preflop and checked flop. They likely have a weak hand. A small bet might take it down immediately. But if they call, we're in a bad spot on the river.\n\nGiven their tight tendencies (lots of preflop folds), they might fold to any bet. But they did limp this hand, so they have something.\n\nI think checking is safer and allows us to potentially bluff on the river if we sense weakness.\n\nI'll check.",

My hand is extremely weak - bottom pair that doesn't beat any board card\n2. Opponent has checked twice already (flop and turn)\n3. Opponent is generally passive\n4. Pot is small (10 chips)\n5. I'm in position (acting first on river)\n\n**Possible lines:**\n- Check: Likely go to showdown, hope opponent also checks and my deuces somehow win\n- Raise/bluff: Try to steal the pot with a bet\n\n**Bluff considerations:**\n- Board has A and J high, could represent an Ace or Jack\n- Opponent has shown willingness to call rivers with marginal hands (hand 24 called 8 with pair of 8s)\n- Opponent checked twice, suggesting weakness\n- If I bet small (4-8 chips), giving 2:1 or 3:1 odds, might get a fold\n- But opponent called river bet in hand 24 with just pair of 8s\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 48.8 BB, healthy stack\n- Risking 4-8 chips to win 10 is reasonable\n- But if called, I lose showdown with bottom pair\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to call rivers with marginal hands (pair of 8s in hand 24), and my hand is literally the worst possible pair (deuces), a bluff might not work. However, the opponent has shown passivity and checked twice. A small bet might take it down.\n\nBut actually, thinking more: The board has A high. If opponent had an Ace, they likely would have bet at some point. They checked flop and turn. They could have a weak Jack, 9, 8, or 5, or a missed draw. My deuces lose to all of those.\n\nI think a small bluff could work. Let's bet 4 chips (minimum raise). If opponent calls with any pair, I lose, but they might fold a weak hand.\n\nActually wait - I'm the BB, I already have 4 chips in the pot from my blind. The pot is 10 chips total. If I bet 4 more, that's risking 4 to win 10, giving opponent 3.5:1 odds. That's a good price for them to call with any pair.\n\nMaybe I should check and hope they check behind. But if they bet, I'd have to fold.\n\nGiven opponent's passivity and my weak hand, I think checking is safer. The pot is small, not worth bluffing.\n\n**Final decision:** Check and go to showdown. If opponent bets, I fold. If opponent checks, I show down my deuces and likely lose, but only lose the 4 chips I already put in.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket deuces is bottom pair on A-high board, loses to any pair.

I'm in the BB, opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking is in seat 1. The action is on me to act first on the river. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand is very weak - bottom pair with deuces on an A-high board. The board has no flush possibilities (two diamonds but not three of same suit), straight possibilities: there's a possible straight with T-Q, but not with the current cards. My deuces are likely only beating a complete bluff.\n\nThe opponent has checked twice (flop and turn), suggesting weakness. They just called preflop from UTG, so their range is wide but likely includes some Aces, maybe weak Jacks, middle pairs, suited connectors.\n\nGiven the small pot (10 chips) and my weak hand, a check seems correct. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands. The opponent might call with any pair, maybe even Ace-high. A bluff raise could work if opponent has complete air, but given they called preflop and checked twice, they might have something like a weak pair or draw that missed.\n\nLooking at opponent's river actions: they've folded once, checked once, called once in previous hands. Not enough data to determine strong tendencies.\n\nMy stack is 195 chips (48.8 BB), healthy. The pot is tiny relative to stacks. No need to risk chips with a weak hand.\n\nI should check and hope to win at showdown if opponent also checks or if they bluff and I call? Actually, if I check and they bet, I'd have to decide whether to call. But checking seems right now.\n\nSo action: check.",

Checking allows me to see opponent's action and potentially get free turn card. Raising with weak hand builds pot unnecessarily against preflop raiser.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with pocket 5s (5h 5c). The board is 8d Td Qs. I have a small pair with a gutshot straight draw (need a 9 for 5-9 straight, but the Q and T are high cards). The board has two diamonds, so there's a flush draw possibility. I have bottom pair.\n\nThe pot is 24 chips. I'm first to act on the flop since the raiser (Seat 2: Kimi-K2) is the only other player. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nFrom the opponent data: Kimi-K2 seems fairly tight - they've folded a lot preflop (hands 31-36). They raised preflop this hand to 10 (2.5x BB). They have 200 chips (50 BB). Their flop tendencies show they usually check (4 checks, 1 fold when facing action).\n\nMy hand: Pocket 5s is vulnerable. The board has Q, T, 8 - all higher than my pair. I have a weak pair with poor kicker. If opponent has any Q, T, 8, or overpair, I'm in bad shape. I also have backdoor straight potential if a 9 comes.\n\nGiven opponent's tight tendencies and that they raised preflop, their range likely includes: pocket pairs 66+, suited connectors, broadway cards. The Q on board likely hits some of their range (AQ, KQ, QJ, QT). The T also hits AT, KT, JT, TT.\n\nI should check and see what opponent does. If they bet, I'll have to consider pot odds. The pot is 24, and I have 175 left (after investing 10 preflop: 2 SB + 8 call). If they bet small (say 12), I'd be getting 3:1 odds. But with bottom pair on a wet board, it's marginal.\n\nActually, checking seems best. I can see if opponent checks behind, then I get a free turn card. If they bet, I can evaluate. Raising seems bad because I don't want to build a big pot with a weak hand against a preflop raiser.\n\nLet me check.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\nWe're at the turn in Hand #37. I'm in the BB with 5h 5c. The board is 8d Td Qs 5d. I have bottom set (three of a kind with 5s). This is a very strong hand - sets are generally strong, though the board is somewhat coordinated with a flush draw (three diamonds) and straight draws possible (J9, 97, etc.).\n\nPot is 24 chips. I checked on the flop, opponent checked back. Now it's my turn to act on the turn with no bet to call (amount to call: 0). I have legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been mostly folding preflop. In hand #30, they showed Ts 6s and checked down. They raised preflop this hand to 10, which is unusual given their folding tendency. They then checked back the flop. This suggests they might have a hand like a big pair (QQ, KK, AA) or maybe AQ, KQ, but they checked back the flop which is interesting.\n\nMy hand is very strong with bottom set. The board has flush and straight draws, so I should build the pot. However, I need to consider:\n1. My stack: 185 chips (46.2 BB) - healthy stack\n2. Opponent stack: 200 chips - similar size\n3. Position: I'm out of position (BB vs preflop raiser)\n4. Tournament considerations: I want to accumulate chips\n\nGiven the flush draw on board, I should bet to charge draws. If I check, opponent might check behind with a weak hand or bet with a strong hand. Since I have a strong made hand, I should bet for value.\n\nThe minimum raise is to 6, but I can bet any amount. I should bet enough to charge flush draws but not so much that I fold out worse hands. A reasonable bet would be around 12-16 chips (half to 2/3 pot).\n\nLet me think about opponent's range: They raised preflop, checked flop. Could have: QQ (top set), TT (middle set), 88 (bottom set), AQ, KQ, QJ, maybe flush draws like AdKd, AdJd, etc. My bottom set beats everything except QQ and TT. QQ is unlikely since I have a 5, board has Q, so they'd need QQ. TT is possible but less likely.\n\nI should bet for value. Let's go with a 2/3 pot bet of 16 chips.",

The blinds are small relative to my stack, but that doesn't mean I should play weak hands from early position.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. However, with such a weak hand, pot odds aren't the main consideration - hand strength and position are more important.\n\nTournament considerations: I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots. Playing 9-8 offsuit from UTG is likely to get me into trouble.\n\nLet me check if there are any opponent tendencies I should consider, but with such a weak hand, I should probably just fold.

My stack is 209 chips (52.2 BB), so I'm deep enough to be selective. The BB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 239 chips. Looking at the opponent history, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding preflop in recent hands, but that doesn't tell me much about their postflop play.\n\nPlaying 98o from UTG is generally a fold in most poker strategies. The hand has poor equity, is easily dominated, and being out of position makes it even worse. Even if I hit a pair, I could be up against higher pairs or better kickers. The only reason to play would be if I think I can outplay opponents postflop, but from UTG that's difficult.\n\nThe pot is only 6 chips, and I need to call 4 chips to see a flop. That's not terrible pot odds (1.5:1), but implied odds are poor because I'm out of position and the hand doesn't have great drawing potential. Even if I flop a straight draw, it's a gutshot with 98o.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and stack size, the correct play is to fold. I should preserve my chips for better spots. Let me also check if there are any other factors. The table has 5 players, so it's not a full table, but still, UTG with 98o is a clear fold.\n\nI'll respond with the JSON object.",

No connectivity, no suitedness, low cards. It's a pure fold from UTG.\n\n2. **Position**: Being UTG means I have to act first preflop and will be out of position for the entire hand. This makes playing weak hands even worse.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 209 chips (52.2 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with junk hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the data:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some reasonable play. Folded often but called with pocket 4s once. \n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Raised preflop once in hand 37 to 10 chips. Mostly folds otherwise.\n   - Still 3 players left to act behind me (seats 4, 5, and then back to 1).\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should preserve chips and wait for better spots. Playing 7-4o from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 6 chips, I need to call 4 to see a flop. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, but with such a terrible hand, implied odds are poor because even if I hit something, it's hard to know if I'm ahead with 7-4.\n\n7. **My recent history**: Looking at my last 10 hands, I've been folding a lot (which is correct with weak hands). I've won a couple with decent hands (pocket 10s, pocket 5s). I should continue this disciplined approach.\n\nThis is an easy fold. Playing this hand would be a significant mistake. Even calling the BB is bad because I'll be out of position with a terrible hand, and I'll likely have to fold to any aggression post-flop.\n\nThe only reasonable action is fold."

This is an extremely weak hand - 7-4 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker, especially from early position. \n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Hand strength**: 7-4 offsuit is terrible. No connectivity, no suitedness, low cards. It's a pure fold from UTG.\n\n2. **Position**: Being UTG means I have to act first preflop and will be out of position for the entire hand. This makes playing weak hands even worse.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 209 chips (52.2 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with junk hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the data:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some reasonable play. Folded often but called with pocket 4s once. \n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Raised preflop once in hand 37 to 10 chips. Mostly folds otherwise.\n   - Still 3 players left to act behind me (seats 4, 5, and then back to 1).\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should preserve chips and wait for better spots. Playing 7-4o from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 6 chips, I need to call 4 to see a flop. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, but with such a terrible hand, implied odds are poor because even if I hit something, it's hard to know if I'm ahead with 7-4.\n\n7. **My recent history**: Looking at my last 10 hands, I've been folding a lot (which is correct with weak hands). I've won a couple with decent hands (pocket 10s, pocket 5s). I should continue this disciplined approach.\n\nThis is an easy fold. Playing this hand would be a significant mistake. Even calling the BB is bad because I'll be out of position with a terrible hand, and I'll likely have to fold to any aggression post-flop.\n\nThe only reasonable action is fold.",

Fold and wait for better spots.\"\n\nThat covers the key points: hand strength, position, stack preservation.

It's offsuit with no straight potential preflop. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm in the SB, which is the worst position postflop. I'll have to act first on every street, making it difficult to play this weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:**\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop 8 times in previous hands. Shows aggressive tendencies. Their raises have been: 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 12, 10 chips. This raise to 24 is larger than previous raises, suggesting stronger hand or adjusting to table dynamics.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has called preflop 6 times, showing loose calling tendencies. Showed down weak hands like 2s5s, 6c7d, 8d7s.\n\n4. **Pot odds:** Pot is 40 chips, need to call 16 chips. That's 2.5:1 pot odds (40:16). However, with Q4o, even with these odds, the hand is too weak to continue, especially out of position.\n\n5. **Stack considerations:** I have 201 chips (25.1 BB). Calling 16 chips would put 8% of my stack in the pot with a very weak hand. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n6. **Tournament implications:** With 25 BB, I'm not in push/fold territory yet, but need to be selective. Q4o from SB facing a raise is an easy fold.\n\n7. **Additional factor:** Seat 5 has already called, so there will be at least 2 opponents if I call. This makes my weak hand even worse.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an easy fold. Q4o from SB facing a raise is not playable. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify playing such a weak hand out of position against likely stronger ranges.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand:** Qc 4d (Queen of clubs, 4 of diamonds) from the SB (small blind)\n**Position:** SB (Seat 3)\n**Stack:** 201 chips (25.1 BB)\n**Blinds:** 4/8\n**Pot:** 40 chips\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Seat 2 (SB position, but posted SB 4) raised to 24 total (16 more to call)\n- Seat 5 called 8 initially\n- Seat 4 folded\n- Seat 1 folded\n\n**Amount to call:** 16 chips\n**Minimum raise to:** 40 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength:** Q4o is a very weak hand, especially from out of position (SB). It's offsuit with no straight potential preflop. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm in the SB, which is the worst position postflop. I'll have to act first on every street, making it difficult to play this weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:**\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop 8 times in previous hands. Shows aggressive tendencies. Their raises have been: 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 12, 10 chips. This raise to 24 is larger than previous raises, suggesting stronger hand or adjusting to table dynamics.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has called preflop 6 times, showing loose calling tendencies. Showed down weak hands like 2s5s, 6c7d, 8d7s.\n\n4. **Pot odds:** Pot is 40 chips, need to call 16 chips. That's 2.5:1 pot odds (40:16). However, with Q4o, even with these odds, the hand is too weak to continue, especially out of position.\n\n5. **Stack considerations:** I have 201 chips (25.1 BB). Calling 16 chips would put 8% of my stack in the pot with a very weak hand. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n6. **Tournament implications:** With 25 BB, I'm not in push/fold territory yet, but need to be selective. Q4o from SB facing a raise is an easy fold.\n\n7. **Additional factor:** Seat 5 has already called, so there will be at least 2 opponents if I call. This makes my weak hand even worse.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an easy fold. Q4o from SB facing a raise is not playable. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify playing such a weak hand out of position against likely stronger ranges.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

Pot odds of 2.5:1 don't justify playing such a weak hand against likely stronger ranges. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\"\n}\n\nWait, I need to check the action again. The amount to call is 16, and I have legal actions: fold, call, raise. Yes, fold is an option. My reasoning should be brief but clear.\n\nActually, let me check: I'm in SB, posted BB? Wait, the hand says: Seat 2 post_sb 4, Seat 3 post_bb 8. So I'm Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) and posted BB 8. So I'm in BB, not SB? The position says \"Your Position: SB (Seat 3)\" but the actions show Seat 2 posted SB 4 and Seat 3 posted BB 8. That seems like a contradiction. Maybe there's a mislabel? Actually, looking at the table: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 is Kimi-K2, Seat 3 is me, Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 called. So Seat 2 posted SB 4, I posted BB 8. So I'm actually in BB position, but the system says \"Your Position: SB (Seat 3)\". This might be a labeling issue in the hand history. Regardless, I'm out of position relative to the raiser (Seat 2) and the caller (Seat 5).\n\nMy analysis stands: Q4o is weak, facing a raise from aggressive player, with another caller already in. Fold.\n\nI'll respond with JSON.",

We're also short-stacked (24.6 BB), so we need to be selective.\n\nIn tournament poker from the SB with a weak hand facing a raise, folding is standard. The BB is yet to act behind us, which adds pressure.\n\nHowever, we could consider a 3-bet bluff since the opponent might be raising light, but with Q6o and being out of position, that's risky. Our stack is short enough that we shouldn't be playing speculative hands.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. We have 24.6 BB left, which is still playable.\n\n**Decision**: Fold."

Their recent raises: 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 12, 10, and now 24. This 24 is their largest raise so far, which might indicate a stronger hand than usual.\n\nOur hand (Q6o) is weak, especially from the SB position. We're out of position for the entire hand if we call. We'd need to put in 20 chips to win 36, giving us pot odds of 20:36 or 1:1.8. We need about 35% equity to call.\n\nAgainst a typical raising range from early position (UTG+1), Q6o has very poor equity. Even against a wider range, it's not great. We're also short-stacked (24.6 BB), so we need to be selective.\n\nIn tournament poker from the SB with a weak hand facing a raise, folding is standard. The BB is yet to act behind us, which adds pressure.\n\nHowever, we could consider a 3-bet bluff since the opponent might be raising light, but with Q6o and being out of position, that's risky. Our stack is short enough that we shouldn't be playing speculative hands.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. We have 24.6 BB left, which is still playable.\n\n**Decision**: Fold.",

The queen with a 5 kicker has poor equity, and while position is good, the hand doesn't have enough value to justify investing chips. Better to preserve my 24.6 BB stack for a stronger hand. Fold and wait for a better spot.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop decision. I have 5h Qd on the button with 197 chips (24.6 BB). Blinds are 4/8. Both players in front folded, so it's just me vs the SB (MiniMax-M2) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B). Amount to call is 8 (the BB), minimum raise to 16.\n\nMy hand is Q5o, which is a weak hand. Queen-high with a bad kicker, offsuit. However, I'm on the button, which is the best position. Let me consider the opponents:\n\nFrom the search results:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has shown some aggression - raised with 7h4s from UTG (hand 40), called with 2s4s from SB (hand 33). Seems to play a wide range.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has raised with 3c2d from SB (hand 32), called a raise with 7h4s (hand 40). Also seems to play somewhat loose.\n\nMy stack is 197 chips (24.6 BB), which is decent but not huge. The BB has 132 chips (16.5 BB), SB has 188 chips (23.5 BB).\n\nPosition is key here. On the button, I can steal the blinds or see a flop cheaply and potentially outplay opponents postflop. However, Q5o is really weak - it's not a good stealing hand. The queen is decent but the 5 kicker is terrible.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 12 (4 SB + 8 BB). That's 1.5:1 odds, or 40% equity needed. Q5o likely has less than 40% equity against two random hands, especially given the BB will be in the pot.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 24.6 BB, which is a workable stack. I shouldn't risk it with marginal hands.\n\nLooking at my hand history: I've been folding a lot of weak hands (which is good). I raised with TT from CO (hand 34) and won.

I have 197 chips (24.6 BB). The blinds are 4/8.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking, BB): Has been folding a lot preflop (folded last 4 hands preflop). Showed 44 in hand 36 and lost.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Folded last 3 hands preflop. Raised to 12 in hand 40 with something.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B, SB): Has been folding a lot too.\n\nFrom my own history, I just had pocket deuces in hand 36 (when I was BB) and lost with them. Pocket pairs can be good for set mining, but from UTG with 2s, it's very marginal.\n\nStack sizes:\n- Me: 197 (24.6 BB)\n- Seat 4: 188 (23.5 BB) - will act after me\n- Seat 5: 140 (17.5 BB) - already posted SB\n- Seat 1: 239 (29.9 BB) - posted BB\n\nIf I call 8 chips, that's 4% of my stack. For set mining, the general rule is you need implied odds of about 10:1 or more. With pocket deuces, I need to flop a set to have a strong hand. The pot is currently 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8). If I call, pot becomes 20.\n\nIf I flop a set, I could potentially win a big pot, but from UTG, I'll be out of position against 3 players behind me. Also, with my stack at 24.6 BB, I don't have deep enough stacks for good implied odds.\n\nLooking at tournament considerations: I'm not in dire straits with 24.6 BB, but I'm not super deep either. Playing pocket deuces from UTG is generally a fold in tournament poker, especially at this stack depth.\n\nThe alternative is to raise, but raising with 22 from UTG would be a bluff and likely get called by better hands. I could potentially steal the blinds, but with 3 players behind including the BB who has 29.9 BB, it's risky.\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies showing lots of folds recently, there might be some fold equity, but 22 is just too weak to open-raise from UTG.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. The 8 chips to call is not much, but playing 22 out of position with marginal implied odds is not good.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has shown some aggression with raises preflop (hands 37, 41, 42).\n3. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has been somewhat active with some raises and calls.\n4. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) - no data yet but will be in position after me.\n\nMy stack is 197 chips (24.6 BB). Blinds are 4/8. I need to call 8 chips to see the flop, which is 4% of my stack.\n\nWith 83o from UTG, this is an easy fold. Even if I call, I'll be out of position against 4 other players, and the hand has very little potential to make strong hands. 83o has poor connectivity, low cards, and offsuit. It's a classic \"fold pre\" hand.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a medium stack (24.6 BB) - not short enough to be desperate, but not deep enough to be speculating with such weak hands. Preserving my stack for better spots is crucial.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 into a pot of 12, giving me 1.5:1 odds, but implied odds are poor because I'm out of position and the hand is weak.\n\nDecision: Fold.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"83o from UTG is one of the weakest starting hands.

Looking at the opponent data, I see Seat 1 has been folding a lot preflop (14 out of 20 recorded actions are folds). They've only called once (hand 36) and checked twice (hands 39 and 44). This is actually their first raise that I can see in the data.\n\nMy stack is 189 chips (23.6 BB). The pot is 36 chips (8 BB + 4 SB + 24 raise). I need to call 16 chips to continue.\n\nPot odds: 16 to win 36, so I need ~31% equity. 8d 6h offsuit has very poor equity against a UTG raising range. Even against a wide range, it's only around 30-35% equity. Against a tighter UTG range, it's worse.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 23.6 BB, which is not desperate but not deep either. I'm in the BB with a weak hand facing a raise from UTG. This is an easy fold spot.\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: they've been very passive/fold-heavy, so this raise might indicate a stronger hand. They showed 44 in hand 36 (small pocket pair) and 96o in hand 21, 86o in hand 24. But those were likely in different positions.\n\nGiven my weak hand (8d 6h offsuit), poor position (out of position postflop), and the fact that this is a raise from UTG from an opponent who rarely raises, this is an easy fold.\n\nI should preserve my stack for better spots. The pot odds aren't compelling enough to justify playing such a weak hand out of position."

Looking at the opponent data, I see Seat 1 has been folding a lot preflop (14 out of 20 recorded actions are folds). They've only called once (hand 36) and checked twice (hands 39 and 44). This is actually their first raise that I can see in the data.\n\nMy stack is 189 chips (23.6 BB). The pot is 36 chips (8 BB + 4 SB + 24 raise). I need to call 16 chips to continue.\n\nPot odds: 16 to win 36, so I need ~31% equity. 8d 6h offsuit has very poor equity against a UTG raising range. Even against a wide range, it's only around 30-35% equity. Against a tighter UTG range, it's worse.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 23.6 BB, which is not desperate but not deep either. I'm in the BB with a weak hand facing a raise from UTG. This is an easy fold spot.\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: they've been very passive/fold-heavy, so this raise might indicate a stronger hand. They showed 44 in hand 36 (small pocket pair) and 96o in hand 21, 86o in hand 24. But those were likely in different positions.\n\nGiven my weak hand (8d 6h offsuit), poor position (out of position postflop), and the fact that this is a raise from UTG from an opponent who rarely raises, this is an easy fold.\n\nI should preserve my stack for better spots. The pot odds aren't compelling enough to justify playing such a weak hand out of position.",

It has very little postflop potential.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is good, but with such a weak hand, position advantage is minimal.\n3. **Pot Odds**: Calling 4 to win 12 gives me 3:1 odds. However, implied odds are poor because 93o rarely makes strong hands.\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: With 23BB, I'm not in dire need to gamble with trash hands. Better to preserve chips.\n5. **Opponent Behavior**: BB has been folding a lot recently, but if he has any hand at all, he'll likely continue postflop.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is an easy fold. 93o has almost no value, even from the button. The small 4-chip call might seem tempting with pot odds, but this hand will frequently put me in difficult spots postflop with marginal holdings. Better to wait for a better spot.\n\n**Action**: Fold.",

My stack is 185 chips (23.1 BB). Blinds are 4/8. The small blind (Seat 4) posted 4, big blind (Seat 5) posted 8. Two players folded, so it's folded to me on the button.\n\nI have 9T suited connectors (though not suited - one club, one heart). This is a decent speculative hand from the button, especially with fold equity. The blinds have 180 and 132 chips respectively. I need to call 8 to see a flop, or I can raise to 16 minimum.\n\nPosition is excellent - I'm on the button. With two players in the blinds, I have good stealing potential. 9T has decent playability postflop, especially from position.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 23.1 BB, which is getting into push/fold territory but not quite there yet. The blinds have similar stacks.\n\nStandard play here would be to raise to steal the blinds, or possibly call to see a flop cheaply. Given my position and hand strength, I should probably raise. A standard raise would be 2.5-3x, so 20-24 chips. The minimum raise is to 16, but I should raise more to deny odds.\n\nLet me check if I have any history on these opponents. But first, I need to make a decision. I'll raise to 20 chips (2.5x). This puts pressure on the blinds and gives me initiative.\n\nReasoning: On the button with 9T, excellent position, good stealing opportunity against two blinds. Raising to 20 chips (2.5x) applies pressure and denies odds. If called, I have position and a hand that can make strong draws or pairs.",

I have to act first on every street, making it difficult to play speculative hands.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 197 chips (24.6 BB) - This is a medium stack. Not so short that I need to push with any two cards, but not deep enough to play speculative hands from early position.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, Seat 1): Has shown some aggression (raised to 24 from BB in hand #46 with 86o). Could defend wide in BB.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has folded to raises, called once from CO with 22.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Small blind, has folded frequently.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 24.6 BB, I should be looking for better spots.

The action: SB (Seat 2) posted 4, I posted 8, then Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called 8, and SB (Kimi-K2) called the additional 4. So there's 24 chips in the pot (4+8+8+4). I have 189 chips (23.6 BB). Amount to call is 0 - I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand: K5 offsuit is not strong. But I'm getting a free look at the flop from the BB with 2 players who have limped in. Both opponents seem somewhat active but not overly aggressive preflop based on history. Kimi-K2 Thinking has been limping/calling sometimes, Kimi-K2 has raised a few times but also folded a lot.\n\nGiven I'm getting to see the flop for free, and K5o is not a hand I want to invest chips with preflop, checking seems correct. Raising would be spewy with this hand. I have position (BB) postflop, but that's not great since I'll act first on flop.\n\nBetter to check, see a cheap flop, and evaluate. If I hit something strong (two pair, trips, etc), I can play. Otherwise fold.\n\nMy stack is 23.6 BB, which is getting short but not critical. No need to get fancy with K5o.\n\nLet me check.",

If I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot. If I bet and get called, I'm playing a big pot out of position with a marginal hand. Checking allows me to control pot size and see what Seat 1 does. Seat 1 has shown some aggression on flops, so if they bet, I can call and re-evaluate on turn.\n\nThe pot is only 24 chips, so not much to protect. I have top pair but vulnerable.

Board has flush draw (hearts) and straight draws (any 2 or 5 makes a straight). My hand is vulnerable.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has shown aggressive tendencies with raises preflop (hands 41, 42, 50). In hand 50, they went all-in preflop with TT. Their check on turn could be weakness or trapping.\n\nSeat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Called preflop, checked flop. Has shown some aggression on flops (hands 44, 49). Could have a wide range.\n\n**Position:** I'm out of position (BB), which is a disadvantage.\n\n**Stack Sizes:** I have 189 chips (23.6 BB), which is short but not desperate. Seat 1 has 271, Seat 2 has 332.\n\n**Pot Odds:** Pot is 24, no bet to call, so I can check for free.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. My hand is marginal top pair with weak kicker\n2. I'm out of position\n3. Board is draw-heavy (flush and straight draws)\n4. Opponents could be slow-playing strong hands\n5. With only 23.6 BB, I need to accumulate chips but also preserve stack\n\n**Options:**\n- Check: See a free river, keep pot small\n- Bet: Try to take down pot now, but risk being raised or called by draws\n\nGiven the draw-heavy board and my weak kicker, checking seems prudent. I can re-evaluate on river. If I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot with a marginal hand.\n\nAlso, I have 23.6 BB which is playable for tournament survival. No need to gamble with marginal hand out of position.\n\nI should check and see what happens on river. If checked to me on river, I can consider value betting thin or checking back depending on card and opponent actions.",

          "content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully.\n\nI'm in the BB with 5c Ks. The board is 3d 4h Kh 9h (turn just dealt). I have top pair with weak kicker (King with 5 kicker). The pot is 44 chips and opponent (Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking) bet 20 after two checks on the turn. I need to call 20.\n\nLooking at opponent history: They've shown some aggression on flops (bet 8 on hand 39 flop, bet 12 on hand 44 flop, bet 20 on hand 49 flop). They seem to bet when checked to on flops. But this is a turn bet after everyone checked flop. The board is somewhat draw-heavy: there's a flush draw (hearts), straight draws (any 5 gives wheel, any 2 gives gutshot, any A gives open-ender). \n\nMy hand: Top pair weak kicker. Vulnerable to better Kings (KQ, KJ, KT, maybe even K9), sets (99, 33, 44), two pair (K9, K4, K3), and draws that could complete. The flush draw is concerning.\n\nStack sizes: I have 189 chips (23.6 BB), opponent has 251 chips. Pot odds: I need to call 20 to win 64 (44+20). That's about 31% pot odds. \n\nWhat range could opponent have? They limped preflop from UTG (Seat 1), so likely medium to weak hands. They checked flop, then bet turn when checked to. Could be value (Kx with better kicker, two pair, sets), could be semi-bluff with draws (heart flush draw, straight draws), or could be bluff trying to take it down.\n\nMy top pair is decent but not strong. Given I'm in position (BB acted first preflop, but now it's heads up and I act after opponent on river), I could call and evaluate river. But I'm worried about reverse implied odds - if I call and improve to two pair or trips, I might not get paid much, but if I'm behind now, I could lose more on river.\n\nLooking at opponent showdowns: They had 44 on hand 36 (hit trips on flop), had 86 on hand 24 (missed), had 9J on hand 21 (missed). They seem to play suited connectors and small pairs.\n\nGiven the board texture and my hand strength, I think this is a marginal spot. I have 31% pot odds, need ~31% equity. Let me estimate my equity: Against a range of better Kings (KQ, KJ, KT, K9), sets (99,33,44), two pair (K9, K4, K3), and flush draws (AhXh, QhJh, etc.), I probably have around 25-35% equity. Against a bluff/semi-bluff range (flush draws, straight draws), I have better equity.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 23.6 BB, which is getting short but not critical. Folding leaves me with 189 chips (23.6 BB). Calling and losing leaves me with 169 chips (21 BB). Not a huge difference.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to bet when checked to on flops, and now betting turn after checks, this could be a probe bet with a wide range. I think calling is reasonable to see river and potentially bluff catch if they check river. But raising seems risky with my marginal hand.\n\nI'll call and evaluate river. If river is a blank and opponent checks, I can check behind or bet small for value. If river completes draws and opponent bets, I can fold.\n\nWait, I should also consider that I have position on river (I act last). That's an advantage for calling.\n\nDecision: Call."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully.\n\nI'm in the BB with 5c Ks. The board is 3d 4h Kh 9h (turn just dealt). I have top pair with weak kicker (King with 5 kicker). The pot is 44 chips and opponent (Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking) bet 20 after two checks on the turn. I need to call 20.\n\nLooking at opponent history: They've shown some aggression on flops (bet 8 on hand 39 flop, bet 12 on hand 44 flop, bet 20 on hand 49 flop). They seem to bet when checked to on flops. But this is a turn bet after everyone checked flop. The board is somewhat draw-heavy: there's a flush draw (hearts), straight draws (any 5 gives wheel, any 2 gives gutshot, any A gives open-ender). \n\nMy hand: Top pair weak kicker. Vulnerable to better Kings (KQ, KJ, KT, maybe even K9), sets (99, 33, 44), two pair (K9, K4, K3), and draws that could complete. The flush draw is concerning.\n\nStack sizes: I have 189 chips (23.6 BB), opponent has 251 chips. Pot odds: I need to call 20 to win 64 (44+20). That's about 31% pot odds. \n\nWhat range could opponent have? They limped preflop from UTG (Seat 1), so likely medium to weak hands. They checked flop, then bet turn when checked to. Could be value (Kx with better kicker, two pair, sets), could be semi-bluff with draws (heart flush draw, straight draws), or could be bluff trying to take it down.\n\nMy top pair is decent but not strong. Given I'm in position (BB acted first preflop, but now it's heads up and I act after opponent on river), I could call and evaluate river. But I'm worried about reverse implied odds - if I call and improve to two pair or trips, I might not get paid much, but if I'm behind now, I could lose more on river.\n\nLooking at opponent showdowns: They had 44 on hand 36 (hit trips on flop), had 86 on hand 24 (missed), had 9J on hand 21 (missed). They seem to play suited connectors and small pairs.\n\nGiven the board texture and my hand strength, I think this is a marginal spot. I have 31% pot odds, need ~31% equity. Let me estimate my equity: Against a range of better Kings (KQ, KJ, KT, K9), sets (99,33,44), two pair (K9, K4, K3), and flush draws (AhXh, QhJh, etc.), I probably have around 25-35% equity. Against a bluff/semi-bluff range (flush draws, straight draws), I have better equity.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 23.6 BB, which is getting short but not critical. Folding leaves me with 189 chips (23.6 BB). Calling and losing leaves me with 169 chips (21 BB). Not a huge difference.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to bet when checked to on flops, and now betting turn after checks, this could be a probe bet with a wide range. I think calling is reasonable to see river and potentially bluff catch if they check river. But raising seems risky with my marginal hand.\n\nI'll call and evaluate river. If river is a blank and opponent checks, I can check behind or bet small for value. If river completes draws and opponent bets, I can fold.\n\nWait, I should also consider that I have position on river (I act last). That's an advantage for calling.\n\nDecision: Call.",

I have trips with king-five. The board is KKK with 3,4,9. There's a flush draw that missed (hearts didn't come). There's a straight possibility: someone could have 5-6 for a straight (3,4,5,6,7? No, board is 3,4,9,K,K, so possible straight is 5-6-7-8-9? Not on board. Actually board is 3,4,9,K,K. So possible straight is 5-6-7-8-9? That's a 5-card straight but board doesn't have 5,6,7,8. So no straight possible. Only possible hand that beats me is a full house: someone with 9-9 for quads? No, quads would be KKKK. Someone with 3-3, 4-4, 9-9 for full house? Actually with three kings on board, someone could have pocket 3s, 4s, or 9s for a full house (kings full of whatever). Also someone could have Kx with a better kicker than my 5. My kicker is 5, which is weak. So if opponent has KQ, KJ, KT, etc., they beat me. If opponent has K3, K4, K9, they have a full house. If opponent has 33,44,99, they have full house.\n\nOpponent is Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking with 251 chips. They called preflop from UTG? Actually seat 1 is UTG? Let's see: seats: 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking), 2 (Kimi-K2, folded), 3 (me BB), 4 (MiniMax-M2 folded), 5 (GPT-OSS-120B folded). So seat 1 is UTG? Actually positions: SB seat 2, BB seat 3, UTG seat 4? Wait typical 5-handed: button seat 5? Let's reconstruct: Blinds 4/8. Seat 2 posted SB 4, seat 3 (me) posted BB 8. Then action: seat 4 folded, seat 1 called 8, seat 2 called 4, seat 3 (me) checked. So seat 1 is UTG? Actually after blinds, seat 4 is first to act (folded), then seat 1 (called), then seat 2 (called). So seat 1 is middle position? Anyway.\n\nOpponent called preflop, then checked flop, then bet 20 on turn when a 9h came. I called with my trips. Now river is Kc, completing three kings. Opponent checked? Wait, the river action: I need to see current state. The prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check, raise\". That means opponent checked to me? Actually the turn action ended with me calling 20. Now river: presumably opponent checked? The prompt doesn't show river action yet. It says \"=== Hand #51 - RIVER ===\" and lists board with Kc. Then \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning no bet facing me. So opponent checked. So I have the option to check or raise (bet). I can check back or bet.\n\nI have trips with weak kicker. The river improved me to trips (I already had trips on turn? Wait: flop was 3d 4h Kh. I had K5, so pair of kings. Turn 9h gave me two pair? Actually I had K5, board K,3,4,9. So I had pair of kings with weak kicker. River K gave me three kings. So I improved from one pair to trips.\n\nOpponent bet 20 on turn. What could they have? They called preflop, checked flop, bet turn. Could be a flush draw (hearts), maybe 9x, maybe a pair of kings with better kicker, maybe a straight draw? But no straight draws obvious. Could be a pair of 9s, maybe 9x. Could be a bluff.\n\nNow they checked river. That suggests they might be scared of the king. Or they have a weak hand and gave up. Or they have a strong hand and are trapping.\n\nI should consider opponent tendencies. Let's use tools to recall opponent actions. First, recall opponent actions for seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking)."

          "reasoning_content": "I'm in the BB with 5c Ks. The board is 3d 4h Kh 9h Kc. I have trips kings with a weak kicker (5). The river brought the Kc, making three kings on board. I have trips with king-five. The board is KKK with 3,4,9. There's a flush draw that missed (hearts didn't come). There's a straight possibility: someone could have 5-6 for a straight (3,4,5,6,7? No, board is 3,4,9,K,K, so possible straight is 5-6-7-8-9? Not on board. Actually board is 3,4,9,K,K. So possible straight is 5-6-7-8-9? That's a 5-card straight but board doesn't have 5,6,7,8. So no straight possible. Only possible hand that beats me is a full house: someone with 9-9 for quads? No, quads would be KKKK. Someone with 3-3, 4-4, 9-9 for full house? Actually with three kings on board, someone could have pocket 3s, 4s, or 9s for a full house (kings full of whatever). Also someone could have Kx with a better kicker than my 5. My kicker is 5, which is weak. So if opponent has KQ, KJ, KT, etc., they beat me. If opponent has K3, K4, K9, they have a full house. If opponent has 33,44,99, they have full house.\n\nOpponent is Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking with 251 chips. They called preflop from UTG? Actually seat 1 is UTG? Let's see: seats: 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking), 2 (Kimi-K2, folded), 3 (me BB), 4 (MiniMax-M2 folded), 5 (GPT-OSS-120B folded). So seat 1 is UTG? Actually positions: SB seat 2, BB seat 3, UTG seat 4? Wait typical 5-handed: button seat 5? Let's reconstruct: Blinds 4/8. Seat 2 posted SB 4, seat 3 (me) posted BB 8. Then action: seat 4 folded, seat 1 called 8, seat 2 called 4, seat 3 (me) checked. So seat 1 is UTG? Actually after blinds, seat 4 is first to act (folded), then seat 1 (called), then seat 2 (called). So seat 1 is middle position? Anyway.\n\nOpponent called preflop, then checked flop, then bet 20 on turn when a 9h came. I called with my trips. Now river is Kc, completing three kings. Opponent checked? Wait, the river action: I need to see current state. The prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check, raise\". That means opponent checked to me? Actually the turn action ended with me calling 20. Now river: presumably opponent checked? The prompt doesn't show river action yet. It says \"=== Hand #51 - RIVER ===\" and lists board with Kc. Then \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning no bet facing me. So opponent checked. So I have the option to check or raise (bet). I can check back or bet.\n\nI have trips with weak kicker. The river improved me to trips (I already had trips on turn? Wait: flop was 3d 4h Kh. I had K5, so pair of kings. Turn 9h gave me two pair? Actually I had K5, board K,3,4,9. So I had pair of kings with weak kicker. River K gave me three kings. So I improved from one pair to trips.\n\nOpponent bet 20 on turn. What could they have? They called preflop, checked flop, bet turn. Could be a flush draw (hearts), maybe 9x, maybe a pair of kings with better kicker, maybe a straight draw? But no straight draws obvious. Could be a pair of 9s, maybe 9x. Could be a bluff.\n\nNow they checked river. That suggests they might be scared of the king. Or they have a weak hand and gave up. Or they have a strong hand and are trapping.\n\nI should consider opponent tendencies. Let's use tools to recall opponent actions. First, recall opponent actions for seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking).",

          "reasoning_content": "I see opponent's actions. They seem to fold a lot preflop, but when they call, they often bet on flop (hand 39, 44, 49). In hand 49, they called preflop (8 chips), then bet 20 on flop. That's similar pattern: call preflop, then bet flop. In this hand, they called preflop, checked flop, then bet turn. That's different. Maybe they have a draw? They checked flop, then bet turn when 9h came. Could be a heart draw, maybe 9hXh? Or maybe they have a pair of 9s. They checked river after king came. That suggests they're scared of the king.\n\nI need to see showdowns: hand 36 they had 44 and checked all streets. Hand 21 they had 9d Jd. Hand 24 they had 8s 6d. So they play some mediocre hands.\n\nMy hand is trips with weak kicker. I'm ahead of many hands: bluffs, pairs, draws. But lose to better kings, full houses. However, given opponent's line: call preflop (could be many hands), check flop (maybe weak or drawing), bet turn (could be value with 9x, or draw), check river (scared of king). Likely they have a hand like 9x, maybe 9T, 9J, etc. Or a heart draw that missed. They might call a small bet but fold to big bet.\n\nPot is 64 chips. I have 169 chips total. I could bet to get value from worse hands. What worse hands call? Possibly 9x, maybe pocket pairs lower than kings. Would they call with a worse king? Unlikely they have a worse king because kicker would be lower than 5? Possible they have K2, K3, K4? Those would be full house actually (K3 with board KKK3 would be full house kings full of 3s). Wait: if they have K3, board is KKK3, they have kings full of 3s. That beats my trips. But they'd likely bet river for value. They checked. So unlikely they have K3.\n\nIf they have Kx with worse kicker than 5 (K2, K3, K4), those are full houses. But they'd probably bet. So they likely don't have a king.\n\nThus they likely have a hand like 9x, or a busted draw. I should bet small for value. Maybe 20-30 chips. If they have 9x, they might call. If they have nothing, they fold. I could also check back and win showdown. But betting extracts value.\n\nMy stack is 169, pot 64. Betting 20 (like 1/3 pot) seems reasonable. If they raise, I'd have to consider folding? They might check-raise with a full house. But unlikely given their line.\n\nLet's search for similar situations. Use search for \"river\" \"king\" etc. But time is limited.\n\nI'll decide: bet small for value. Raise to 20 (minimum raise) or maybe 30. Minimum raise to is 20 (that's the minimum bet?). Actually \"Minimum raise to: 20\" means the minimum total bet is 20? Wait, amount to call is 0. Minimum raise to 20 means if I want to raise (bet), I need to put at least 20 chips total. That's a bet of 20 into 64 pot. That's about 31% pot. Reasonable.\n\nI'll bet 20. If they call, I likely win. If they raise, I might fold unless I think they're bluffing.\n\nThus action: raise to 20.

Tournament stack preservation with 31.1 BB favors folding this marginal hand. UTG's recent raises suggest stronger holdings.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current hand:** I'm in the small blind with Kc4c (King-4 suited clubs). The pot is 44 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + UTG raise to 32). UTG (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 32 total (24 more than BB). I need to call 28 chips (32 - my 4 SB already posted).\n\n**My stack:** 249 chips (31.1 BB)\n**UTG stack:** 199 chips (24.9 BB)\n**BB stack:** 164 chips (20.5 BB)\n\n**Position:** I'm in SB, which is bad position for the rest of the hand. UTG raised, so I'm out of position against the raiser.\n\n**Hand strength:** K4s is a marginal hand. It's suited, which helps, but K4 has poor kicker issues and is dominated by many hands that UTG might raise with. As a suited connector, it's not great - K4 doesn't connect well.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at UTG's recent actions:\n- Hand 46: UTG raised to 24 preflop (3x BB)\n- Hand 47-48: Folded preflop\n- Hand 49: Called BB (limped), then bet flop\n- Hand 50: Folded preflop\n- Hand 51: Limped again, then check-called postflop\n\nUTG seems to be playing a mix of raising premium hands and limping with weaker ones. The current raise to 32 (4x BB) suggests a stronger hand than the 3x raise in hand 46.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 28 chips to win 44 chips (pot before my call). That's 28 to win 44, or about 1.57:1 odds, meaning I need ~39% equity to call. K4s vs a reasonable UTG raising range (maybe top 20%: 77+, A9s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KJo+) has only about 35-40% equity, so it's borderline.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 31.1 BB, which is a healthy stack. UTG has 24.9 BB, BB has 20.5 BB. I'm not in dire need of chips.\n\n**Position disadvantage:** Being in SB out of position against UTG raiser is a major problem. Even if I hit a piece of the flop, I'll have to act first on every street.\n\n**BB still to act:** The BB (MiniMax-M2) has yet to act behind me. If I call, BB might squeeze or call, creating a multiway pot where my hand equity improves but I'm still out of position.\n\n**Better alternative:** Folding seems prudent. K4s is not a hand I want to play for a 4x raise from UTG from the small blind. The suitedness gives some value, but the positional disadvantage and kicker issues make this a fold.\n\nLet me check if there's any history of UTG showing down weak hands after raising... Looking at showdowns: UTG showed 9dJd (hand 21), 8s6d (hand 24), 4s4h (hand 36), 8dTh (hand 51). These are mostly limped/called hands, not raised hands. The raised hand (hand 46) didn't go to showdown.\n\nGiven all this analysis, I should fold. The pot odds are borderline, but the positional disadvantage and tournament stack preservation considerations make folding correct.",

They've shown some aggression - in hand 52 they raised preflop to 32 (4x BB) and then raised again on flop. They seem capable of aggression.\n\n**Action:** It's folded to me on the button.

It can make straights and flushes, but it's weak preflop. The value comes from position and implied odds.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Conservative but reasonable given the low hand strength.\n2. **Call:** Taking a cheap flop in position with speculative hand.

Also capable of betting and calling.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has shown some aggression too (hand 50 raised to 60 then 164 preflop). Also has folded several times preflop.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has called preflop bets and shown some postflop aggression.\n\nI'm in early position (UTG) with a weak hand. In tournament poker, playing Q3o from UTG is generally a fold. The pot odds are 12:8 (1.5:1), but the implied odds are poor with such a weak hand.\n\nConsidering my tournament situation: I have 31.1 BB, which is a playable stack. However, Q3o has very little potential to make strong hands. Even if I hit a pair, it's vulnerable to overcards. The reverse implied odds are high - I could hit a weak pair and lose a lot of chips.\n\nGiven that I'm in early position and will have to act first postflop against 3 opponents (SB, BB, and MiniMax-M2 in CO), this is a clear fold.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns I should consider. Looking at the opponents, they seem capable of aggression, so calling could lead to being raised behind me.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q3o is too weak to play from UTG in a tournament.

Opponent just called preflop from UTG, which could indicate a medium-strength hand, maybe suited connectors, small pairs, or Broadway cards.\n\nOpponent tendencies: From the recall, Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown some aggression (raised preflop in hand 52, raised flop in hand 52, bet flop in hand 53). But they also called preflop in hand 54 and folded to a bet on flop. They checked the flop this hand, which suggests weakness or a draw.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 20 chips. If I bet, I could bet 8-16 chips (half to 3/4 pot). Checking is also reasonable to control pot size and see a river card.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 30 BB, which is decent. My two pair is vulnerable to flush draws and straight draws. A heart could complete a flush, and any 2 or 5 could make a straight. I should consider protecting my hand.\n\nDecision: I have two pair, which is strong but vulnerable. I'm out of position. Checking could allow a free card that beats me. Betting could extract value from weaker hands and charge draws. Given the opponent checked flop, they might be weak or have a draw. A small bet (8-12 chips) seems reasonable to charge draws while not committing too much.\n\nActually, looking at the board again: 3d Ts Kh 4h. The flush draw is hearts. I don't have any hearts, so I'm vulnerable to that. There's also potential straight draws with QJ, J9, or A2. A bet protects my hand.\n\nI'll bet small to medium. Let's say 12 chips (60% of pot). That's a reasonable sizing.\n\nWait, but I need to consider that the opponent just called preflop from UTG and checked flop. They might have a hand like KQ, KJ, KT, or a medium pair. They could also have a draw. A bet might fold out weaker hands, but I do want value.\n\nActually, checking might not be terrible either since I'm out of position and could face a raise if I bet. But my hand is strong enough to bet for value and protection.\n\nI'll go with a small bet."

The pot is currently 36 chips (4 SB + 8 BB + 24 raise = 36). If I call, pot will be 56 chips.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop frequently - I see 10 raises in the data. Their raises range from 6 to 164 chips, with 24 being a common size (hands 41, 42). They have shown down Ts6s and ThTs, so they're playing a mix of speculative and premium hands.\n\nMy hand: Js8s is a suited connector, which has some potential but is weak. As small blind, I'm out of position for the entire hand, which is a significant disadvantage. I have 32.1 BB, which is a decent stack but not huge.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 20 to win 56 (if I call), so I need ~35.7% equity. J8s against a typical raising range (say 15-20% of hands) has about 35-40% equity, so pot odds might be borderline.\n\nHowever, being out of position with a marginal hand makes this difficult. Also, the BB (Seat 4) still has to act behind me with 152 chips. If I call, the BB might squeeze or call.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 32.1 BB, which is workable. Folding preserves my stack. Calling puts me in a tricky spot postflop out of position with a marginal hand.\n\nGiven these factors, I think folding is correct. J8s is not strong enough to play out of position against a raise, especially when we're not getting great pot odds and have position disadvantage.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns with Seat 2's 24 chip raises. They made 24 chip raises in hands 41 and 42. I should see what happened in those hands."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm in the small blind with Js8s. My stack is 257 chips (32.1 BB). Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 24 (3x BB). I need to call 20 chips. The pot is currently 36 chips (4 SB + 8 BB + 24 raise = 36). If I call, pot will be 56 chips.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop frequently - I see 10 raises in the data. Their raises range from 6 to 164 chips, with 24 being a common size (hands 41, 42). They have shown down Ts6s and ThTs, so they're playing a mix of speculative and premium hands.\n\nMy hand: Js8s is a suited connector, which has some potential but is weak. As small blind, I'm out of position for the entire hand, which is a significant disadvantage. I have 32.1 BB, which is a decent stack but not huge.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 20 to win 56 (if I call), so I need ~35.7% equity. J8s against a typical raising range (say 15-20% of hands) has about 35-40% equity, so pot odds might be borderline.\n\nHowever, being out of position with a marginal hand makes this difficult. Also, the BB (Seat 4) still has to act behind me with 152 chips. If I call, the BB might squeeze or call.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 32.1 BB, which is workable. Folding preserves my stack. Calling puts me in a tricky spot postflop out of position with a marginal hand.\n\nGiven these factors, I think folding is correct. J8s is not strong enough to play out of position against a raise, especially when we're not getting great pot odds and have position disadvantage.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns with Seat 2's 24 chip raises. They made 24 chip raises in hands 41 and 42. I should see what happened in those hands.",

It has almost no potential to make strong hands postflop.\n\n**Position: BTN** - This is the best position at the table, which gives me an advantage postflop. However, with such a weak hand, position alone doesn't justify playing.\n\n**Stack: 257 chips (32.1 BB)** - I have a healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n**Opponent actions:**\n- Seat 4 (SB) posted 4\n- Seat 1 (BB) posted 8  \n- Seat 2 called 8\n\n**Opponent tendencies from memory:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has called preflop with marginal hands like T6s and TT\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been folding a lot preflop but occasionally calls or raises\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been fairly active, calling and raising with various hands\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 8 into a pot of 20 (12 in pot + 8 from my call). That's 2.5:1 odds, or 29% equity needed.\n\n**Hand analysis:** 83o has very low equity against random hands. Even against loose calling ranges, it's unlikely to have 29% equity. The hand has almost no straight or flush potential, and making a pair of 8s or 3s is vulnerable.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 32 BB, I'm not in push/fold territory. I should preserve my stack for better spots. Playing 83o from the button might seem tempting due to position, but it's a hand that will often put me in difficult spots postflop with marginal holdings.\n\n**Decision:** This is an easy fold. The hand is too weak to play, even with position. The pot odds aren't compelling enough given the hand's terrible equity. I should wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"83o is one of the worst starting hands in poker.

I have 257 chips (32.1 BB). The blinds are 4/8, so I need to call 8 chips to see the flop.\n\nKey factors:\n1. Hand strength: 2c 3s is terrible. It's unsuited, low cards, no connectivity. It's a pure fold from UTG.\n2. Position: UTG is the worst position - I'll have to act first on every street.\n3. Stack size: 32 BB is decent but not huge. I should be preserving my stack.\n4. Opponents: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has shown some loose calls preflop. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been folding a lot preflop but recently raised once. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is yet to act behind me with 148 chips.\n5. Tournament considerations: With 32 BB, I shouldn't be playing garbage hands from UTG. I need to wait for better spots.\n\nPot odds: 8 to call into 12 pot = 1.5:1 odds, but with such a terrible hand, implied odds don't matter much. Even if I hit a miracle flop (like 2-3-5 for a straight draw or two pair), I'm out of position and likely won't get paid much.\n\nFrom my hand history, I've been folding a lot (43 folds out of 57 hands), which is appropriate for tournament poker. I should continue with disciplined folding.\n\nThis is an easy fold. I shouldn't be playing 23o from UTG in any circumstance.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with the JSON format. First, I should analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with 6s 6h. My stack is 249 chips (31.1 BB). The blinds are 4/8. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted SB 4 and called 4 more, so they put in 8 total. I've already posted BB 8. The pot is 16 chips. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nI have pocket 6s, a medium pocket pair. In the BB, facing just the SB who called. This is heads-up now. Pocket 6s is decent heads-up, but not great. I should consider raising to build the pot and potentially take it down preflop, or see a flop with position disadvantage (SB will act first postflop).\n\nBut wait, I'm BB, so I'll act first postflop? Actually, SB called, so SB is first to act preflop? Let's see: Seat 2 is SB, they called. I'm BB. Preflop action: SB posted 4, I posted 8, then others folded, SB called 4 more. So SB completed to 8. Now action is on me in BB. I can check or raise.\n\nPostflop: SB will act first (since they're left of dealer? Actually need to know positions). Typically in 5-handed: Button is seat 5 (folded), SB is seat 2, BB is seat 3. So postflop, SB acts first, then BB (me). So I have position advantage (SB acts first). That's good.\n\nI should consider opponent tendencies. Let me recall opponent actions for seat 2. But I need to respond with JSON, can't call tools now. However, I can think generally: SB just called, didn't raise. Could be a weak hand or trapping. With 6s, I'm ahead of many random hands SB might have. Raising could get folds from weak hands. If I raise, minimum raise to 16 (double the current bet of 8). That would be 8 more chips for me (since I already have 8 in). My stack is 249, so raising to 16 is fine.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 31 BB, decent stack. Not too short, not deep. I want to accumulate chips but avoid risky spots.\n\nI think raising is good here with pocket pair. I can either take down the pot preflop or see a flop with a hand that can hit a set. If I hit a set, I can win big. If not, I can often check-fold if overcards come.\n\nLet's raise to 16 (minimum) or maybe larger. Minimum raise to 16 is small, only doubling the pot to 24. Might not get much fold equity. Could raise to 20 or 24. But need to consider stack sizes. SB has 296 chips (37 BB). If I raise to 24 (total), that's 16 more for me. Pot would be 40. That's reasonable.\n\nI'll raise to 24. That's 3x the BB. Standard raise.\n\nNow, need to output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with the proper JSON format. Let me structure my response correctly.\n\nCurrent situation: I have pocket 6s on Q-5-2 flop. I'm the preflop raiser. Opponent checked to me. I should make a continuation bet. The pot is 48 chips. A bet of around 24-32 chips (1/2 to 2/3 pot) is standard.\n\nI'll bet 28 chips. Since \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount I'm putting in, and I've already put in 24 preflop, I need to calculate the additional amount. Actually wait, let me think about the pot structure.\n\nPreflop: I put in 24 total. Now on the flop, opponent checked. If I want to bet 28 chips into the 48 chip pot, that means I'm adding 28 more chips. But \"raise_to\" should be my total investment this street. Actually no, \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount I'm putting in for the hand, not just this street.\n\nLet me re-read: \"If raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\"\n\nSo currently I've put in 24 chips preflop. If I want to bet 28 chips on the flop, my total investment would be 24 + 28 = 52 chips.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me think about typical betting. In poker, when you bet on the flop, you're adding to your existing investment. So if the pot is 48 and I want to bet 28, I'm putting 28 more chips in. My total investment becomes 24 + 28 = 52.\n\nActually, looking at the instructions again: \"If raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\"\n\nSo if I want to bet 28 chips on the flop, I should set raise_to = 52 (24 preflop + 28 flop).\n\nBut is that correct? Let me check the example from the system. The system says: \"If raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\"\n\nYes, so total for the entire hand, not just this street.\n\nActually, wait. Looking at the preflop action: \"Seat 3 raise 24\" - that was my total preflop raise to 24 chips. So my current total investment is 24 chips.\n\nIf I want to bet 28 chips on the flop, my new total would be 52 chips.\n\nBut let me think if that makes sense. The pot is 48 chips. If I bet 28, opponent would need to call 28 to win 48 + 28 = 76. That's reasonable pot odds.\n\nActually, I should check what \"minimum raise to: 16\" means. That probably means the minimum additional amount I can bet is 16 chips. So I could bet anywhere from 16 to all-in.\n\nI think a bet of 24 chips (making it 1/2 pot) is good. That would make my total investment 24 + 24 = 48 chips.\n\nActually, simpler: I'll bet 24 chips (1/2 pot). So my total investment becomes 24 preflop + 24 flop = 48 chips total.\n\nLet me respond with JSON.",

This is actually their first preflop raise I've seen (based on the search results showing no previous preflop raises). That suggests they might have a decent hand.\n\nHowever, looking at my own hand history, I recently won with pocket 6s from the BB (hand #59) by raising preflop and betting flop. Small pairs can be profitable if we hit sets.\n\n**Pot odds:** Calling 20 to win 36 pot = 36:20 = 1.8:1 odds. We need ~35.7% equity. Against a typical raising range (maybe 15-20% of hands), pocket 2s has ~50% equity. But we're out of position.\n\n**Implied odds:** If we hit a set (12.5% chance), we can potentially win a big pot. With 277 stack vs opponent's 256, we have good implied odds.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** We have a healthy stack, not desperate. Folding is fine, but calling to set mine might be +EV.\n\n**Decision:** I think calling to set mine is reasonable. We have good implied odds with deep enough stacks. Raising with 22 out of position seems bad - we're likely behind any calling range. Folding is also fine, but we're getting decent pot odds.\n\nI'll call."

This is actually their first preflop raise I've seen (based on the search results showing no previous preflop raises). That suggests they might have a decent hand.\n\nHowever, looking at my own hand history, I recently won with pocket 6s from the BB (hand #59) by raising preflop and betting flop. Small pairs can be profitable if we hit sets.\n\n**Pot odds:** Calling 20 to win 36 pot = 36:20 = 1.8:1 odds. We need ~35.7% equity. Against a typical raising range (maybe 15-20% of hands), pocket 2s has ~50% equity. But we're out of position.\n\n**Implied odds:** If we hit a set (12.5% chance), we can potentially win a big pot. With 277 stack vs opponent's 256, we have good implied odds.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** We have a healthy stack, not desperate. Folding is fine, but calling to set mine might be +EV.\n\n**Decision:** I think calling to set mine is reasonable. We have good implied odds with deep enough stacks. Raising with 22 out of position seems bad - we're likely behind any calling range. Folding is also fine, but we're getting decent pot odds.\n\nI'll call.",

Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nMy analysis: Pocket 2s, out of position, but getting 1.8:1 pot odds. Against a likely decent hand from opponent's first raise, we're set mining.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand #60 - FLOP**\n- My position: SB (Seat 3)\n- My cards: 2s 2h (pocket deuces)\n- My stack: 257 chips (32.1 BB)\n- Board: 5c 9d 3c\n- Pot: 72 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (checking is available)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Preflop action:** Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 24, I called 20 from SB, Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 16 from BB.\n\n**Board analysis:** 5c 9d 3c. This is a low, disconnected board. My pocket deuces give me bottom pair. There's a flush draw with two clubs. The board is relatively dry otherwise.\n\n**Hand strength:** I have bottom pair with a weak kicker. However, the board is low, so my 2s might be good if opponents missed. There are some straight draws (4-6, 6-8, A-4), but not many. The flush draw is present.\n\n**Position:** I'm in SB, so I'll act first on future streets. This is a disadvantage.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from history:**\n1. **Kimi-K2 (Seat 2):** From hand #59, they called a raise with something (likely middling hand) and folded to a flop bet. In hand #50, they 3-bet preflop. Seems somewhat aggressive but folds to pressure.\n2. **MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):** From hand #54, they raised preflop with Q3o and bet flop. In hand #52, they called a raise with K4s and bet flop. Seems to play somewhat aggressively postflop.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- Me: 257 chips\n- Kimi-K2: 256 chips  \n- MiniMax-M2: 148 chips (shortest stack)\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 72. If I check, I'm getting infinite odds to see the turn. If I bet and get called, I'm building a pot with a weak hand.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have a decent stack (32 BB). MiniMax-M2 is shorter (18.5 BB). Kimi-K2 has similar stack to me.\n\n**Decision points:**\n1. **Check:** Standard with bottom pair out of position. Allows me to see what opponents do.\n2. **Bet:** Could try to take it down now with a small bet, but risky against two opponents.\n3. **Fold:** Not an option since it's free to check.\n\nGiven I'm out of position with bottom pair on a dry board, checking seems best. I can evaluate turn action. If checked through, I get a free card to potentially improve to a set (2 outs). If someone bets, I can decide based on bet size and opponent tendencies.\n\nThe flush draw is concerning, but betting out of position with bottom pair into two opponents seems overly ambitious. Better to check and see the action.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking with bottom pair 2s out of position on dry board 5c 9d 3c.

Wait, actually I have 257 total stack, I already put in 4 SB preflop, then called 20 more preflop = 24 total invested so far.**\n\n**Position: SB (Seat 3) - I act after Seat 4 (BB) bet and Seat 2 called**\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Bet 40 on flop, has 108 chips total stack (68 left after bet?)\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Called the 40 bet, has 216 chips total stack\n\n**Preflop action:** Seat 2 raised to 24, I called from SB with pocket 2s, BB called.\n\n**Flop: 5c 9d 3c** - This is a relatively dry flop with a flush draw (clubs). My pocket 2s give me a pair of 2s, which is bottom pair. I'm behind any pair higher than 2s, but I have a gutshot straight draw to a wheel (A2345) - need a 4. Also backdoor flush potential if I had clubs, but I don't.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 152 + 40 bet = 192 if I call. Need to call 40 to win 192, giving me ~4.8:1 odds (17% equity needed).\n\n**My equity:** With bottom pair and gutshot, against reasonable ranges:\n- Seat 2 (raiser): Could have overpairs, big cards, maybe suited connectors\n- Seat 4 (better): Could have hit top pair, flush draw, straight draw\n\nAgainst top pair (9x), my equity is poor (~15%). Against overcards (AK, AQ) with club draw, I have ~35%. Against flush draws, I'm ahead (~55%). Against sets, I'm dead.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from recall:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression - bet flop in hand 54, bet turn and river in hand 58. Seems capable of betting draws or made hands.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Seems more passive - called turn bet in hand 58, folded river. Called flop bet here.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 257 chips (32 BB), which is healthy. Seat 4 has only 108 chips (13.5 BB) and is likely playing more aggressively due to short stack.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I have bottom pair with gutshot - marginal hand\n2. Pot odds are decent (4.8:1)\n3. Implied odds: If I hit a 2 (2 outs) or 4 (4 outs for straight), I could win more chips\n4. Reverse implied odds: If I'm already behind to a 9 or overpair, I could lose more chips\n5. Position: I'm out of position for rest of hand\n6. Multiway pot: Two opponents, increases chance someone has a real hand\n\nThe fact that Seat 4 bet 40 into 152 pot (~26% pot) is a moderate bet. Could be testing with a draw or protecting a medium pair. Seat 2's call suggests he has something - maybe a draw or pair.\n\nGiven my stack size and the pot odds, I think calling is reasonable. Folding is too tight given the odds. Raising seems risky with bottom pair out of position against two players.\n\nActually, let me check stack sizes more carefully:\n- Seat 4: Started with 108, bet 40 on flop, has 68 left\n- Seat 2: Started with 216, called 40, has 176 left\n- Me: 257 total, invested 24 preflop, have 233 left\n\nIf I call, pot becomes 232, and effective stacks are:\n- Seat 4: 68 (very short)\n- Seat 2: 176\n- Me: 193 after calling\n\nActually wait, I need to recalculate: My stack is 257 total. I put in 4 SB + 20 call preflop = 24. So I have 233 left. If I call 40 more, I'll have 193 left.\n\nWith Seat 4 so short, he might be committing with any decent hand. If I call and he's all-in on turn, I get to see river cheaply.\n\nI think calling is the best play. It keeps the pot small, allows me to see turn, and I have some equity. Folding gives up too easily given pot odds. Raising blo"

Wait, actually I have 257 total stack, I already put in 4 SB preflop, then called 20 more preflop = 24 total invested so far.**\n\n**Position: SB (Seat 3) - I act after Seat 4 (BB) bet and Seat 2 called**\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Bet 40 on flop, has 108 chips total stack (68 left after bet?)\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Called the 40 bet, has 216 chips total stack\n\n**Preflop action:** Seat 2 raised to 24, I called from SB with pocket 2s, BB called.\n\n**Flop: 5c 9d 3c** - This is a relatively dry flop with a flush draw (clubs). My pocket 2s give me a pair of 2s, which is bottom pair. I'm behind any pair higher than 2s, but I have a gutshot straight draw to a wheel (A2345) - need a 4. Also backdoor flush potential if I had clubs, but I don't.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 152 + 40 bet = 192 if I call. Need to call 40 to win 192, giving me ~4.8:1 odds (17% equity needed).\n\n**My equity:** With bottom pair and gutshot, against reasonable ranges:\n- Seat 2 (raiser): Could have overpairs, big cards, maybe suited connectors\n- Seat 4 (better): Could have hit top pair, flush draw, straight draw\n\nAgainst top pair (9x), my equity is poor (~15%). Against overcards (AK, AQ) with club draw, I have ~35%. Against flush draws, I'm ahead (~55%). Against sets, I'm dead.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from recall:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression - bet flop in hand 54, bet turn and river in hand 58. Seems capable of betting draws or made hands.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Seems more passive - called turn bet in hand 58, folded river. Called flop bet here.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 257 chips (32 BB), which is healthy. Seat 4 has only 108 chips (13.5 BB) and is likely playing more aggressively due to short stack.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I have bottom pair with gutshot - marginal hand\n2. Pot odds are decent (4.8:1)\n3. Implied odds: If I hit a 2 (2 outs) or 4 (4 outs for straight), I could win more chips\n4. Reverse implied odds: If I'm already behind to a 9 or overpair, I could lose more chips\n5. Position: I'm out of position for rest of hand\n6. Multiway pot: Two opponents, increases chance someone has a real hand\n\nThe fact that Seat 4 bet 40 into 152 pot (~26% pot) is a moderate bet. Could be testing with a draw or protecting a medium pair. Seat 2's call suggests he has something - maybe a draw or pair.\n\nGiven my stack size and the pot odds, I think calling is reasonable. Folding is too tight given the odds. Raising seems risky with bottom pair out of position against two players.\n\nActually, let me check stack sizes more carefully:\n- Seat 4: Started with 108, bet 40 on flop, has 68 left\n- Seat 2: Started with 216, called 40, has 176 left\n- Me: 257 total, invested 24 preflop, have 233 left\n\nIf I call, pot becomes 232, and effective stacks are:\n- Seat 4: 68 (very short)\n- Seat 2: 176\n- Me: 193 after calling\n\nActually wait, I need to recalculate: My stack is 257 total. I put in 4 SB + 20 call preflop = 24. So I have 233 left. If I call 40 more, I'll have 193 left.\n\nWith Seat 4 so short, he might be committing with any decent hand. If I call and he's all-in on turn, I get to see river cheaply.\n\nI think calling is the best play. It keeps the pot small, allows me to see turn, and I have some equity. Folding gives up too easily given pot odds. Raising blo",

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the SB with pocket 2s. The board is 5c 9d 3c 9h. The turn just came 9h, pairing the board. I have pocket 2s, so I have a small pocket pair with a board of 5-9-3-9. I have a weak hand - just a pair of 2s, which is likely not good here. However, I do have a gutshot straight draw: I need a 4 to make a straight (2-3-4-5). Actually, looking at the board 5c 9d 3c 9h, I have 2s 2h. With a 4, I'd have 2-3-4-5 straight. That's 4 outs (four 4s in the deck). But the board is paired with 9s, so someone could have trips or a full house.\n\nThe pot is 192 chips. I have 217 chips total. The action is on me on the turn, and I can check or raise. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) bet 40 on the flop, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called, and I called. Now it's my turn to act on the turn.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2): From the data, seems like a passive player who checks and calls often. In hand 58, they checked multiple streets and called a small bet on turn. In hand 59, they called preflop raises. They've shown some showdowns with mediocre hands like T6s and TTs.\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2): More aggressive - has raised preflop and bet on flop and turn in previous hands. In hand 58, they bet turn and river with small bets. They have shown a hand with K4s.\n\nThe flop bet of 40 by Seat 4 into a pot of ~72 (24+24+24 preflop) is a significant bet. Both opponents called. The turn brought a 9h, pairing the board. This could be a scare card for someone with a 9, or it could help someone with trips.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 2s is very weak. I'm basically drawing to a 4 for a straight (4 outs) or hitting another 2 for trips (2 outs), but even trips might not be good if someone has a 9. I have 6 clean outs at best.\n\nPot odds: If I check and someone bets, I'll need to consider calling. Currently, the pot is 192. If I face a bet, say 40 again, I'd be getting 192:40 or about 4.8:1 odds. I need about 7:1 odds to chase a 6-outer (about 12.8% chance). So not great pot odds.\n\nHowever, I'm in position relative to the bettor? Actually, I'm SB, Seat 4 is BB, Seat 2 is UTG? Let me check positions: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 is UTG? Actually, positions: Seat 3 is SB (me), Seat 4 is BB, Seat 1 is UTG? Wait, the hand says: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking (folded), Seat 2: Kimi-K2, Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 (me), Seat 4: MiniMax-M2, Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B (folded). So Seat 2 is UTG, I'm SB, Seat 4 is BB. On the turn, action goes: me (SB) first, then Seat 4 (BB), then Seat 2 (UTG). Actually, wait - after the flop, Seat 4 (BB) bet, Seat 2 called, I called. So on the turn, I act first because I'm SB.\n\nGiven that I have a weak hand and I'm out of position (acting first), checking is likely best. If I check and Seat 4 bets again, I'll need to reconsider. But checking seems standard here.\n\nLet me think about raising as a bluff. The board is paired with 9s. If I raise, I could represent a 9 or a full house. But with two opponents who called a flop bet, one of them might have a 9 or a draw. Seat 4's flop bet could be a continuation bet with a wide range, or they could have a real hand. Given my stack size (27 BB), I don't want to commit too many chips with a weak hand.\n\nChecking seems prudent. I can see what Seat 4 does. If they check behind, I get a free river. If they bet, I can evaluate pot odds.\n\n"

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the SB with pocket 2s. The board is 5c 9d 3c 9h. The turn just came 9h, pairing the board. I have pocket 2s, so I have a small pocket pair with a board of 5-9-3-9. I have a weak hand - just a pair of 2s, which is likely not good here. However, I do have a gutshot straight draw: I need a 4 to make a straight (2-3-4-5). Actually, looking at the board 5c 9d 3c 9h, I have 2s 2h. With a 4, I'd have 2-3-4-5 straight. That's 4 outs (four 4s in the deck). But the board is paired with 9s, so someone could have trips or a full house.\n\nThe pot is 192 chips. I have 217 chips total. The action is on me on the turn, and I can check or raise. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) bet 40 on the flop, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called, and I called. Now it's my turn to act on the turn.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2): From the data, seems like a passive player who checks and calls often. In hand 58, they checked multiple streets and called a small bet on turn. In hand 59, they called preflop raises. They've shown some showdowns with mediocre hands like T6s and TTs.\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2): More aggressive - has raised preflop and bet on flop and turn in previous hands. In hand 58, they bet turn and river with small bets. They have shown a hand with K4s.\n\nThe flop bet of 40 by Seat 4 into a pot of ~72 (24+24+24 preflop) is a significant bet. Both opponents called. The turn brought a 9h, pairing the board. This could be a scare card for someone with a 9, or it could help someone with trips.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 2s is very weak. I'm basically drawing to a 4 for a straight (4 outs) or hitting another 2 for trips (2 outs), but even trips might not be good if someone has a 9. I have 6 clean outs at best.\n\nPot odds: If I check and someone bets, I'll need to consider calling. Currently, the pot is 192. If I face a bet, say 40 again, I'd be getting 192:40 or about 4.8:1 odds. I need about 7:1 odds to chase a 6-outer (about 12.8% chance). So not great pot odds.\n\nHowever, I'm in position relative to the bettor? Actually, I'm SB, Seat 4 is BB, Seat 2 is UTG? Let me check positions: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 is UTG? Actually, positions: Seat 3 is SB (me), Seat 4 is BB, Seat 1 is UTG? Wait, the hand says: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking (folded), Seat 2: Kimi-K2, Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 (me), Seat 4: MiniMax-M2, Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B (folded). So Seat 2 is UTG, I'm SB, Seat 4 is BB. On the turn, action goes: me (SB) first, then Seat 4 (BB), then Seat 2 (UTG). Actually, wait - after the flop, Seat 4 (BB) bet, Seat 2 called, I called. So on the turn, I act first because I'm SB.\n\nGiven that I have a weak hand and I'm out of position (acting first), checking is likely best. If I check and Seat 4 bets again, I'll need to reconsider. But checking seems standard here.\n\nLet me think about raising as a bluff. The board is paired with 9s. If I raise, I could represent a 9 or a full house. But with two opponents who called a flop bet, one of them might have a 9 or a draw. Seat 4's flop bet could be a continuation bet with a wide range, or they could have a real hand. Given my stack size (27 BB), I don't want to commit too many chips with a weak hand.\n\nChecking seems prudent. I can see what Seat 4 does. If they check behind, I get a free river. If they bet, I can evaluate pot odds.\n\n",

Let me check: He had 96 chips preflop, called 40 on flop (56 left), now bets 120? That's an all-in bet then. Actually, he must have 56 chips left and is betting all-in for 56, not 120. But the prompt says \"bet 120\" and \"amount to call: 120\". Let me re-examine: Pot is 312, he bets 120, but he only has 96 total? Something doesn't add up. Maybe I misread stack sizes or there's a discrepancy.)\n\nWait, let me recalculate stacks from beginning:\n- Preflop: Seat 2 started with 96 chips\n- Preflop action: Seat 2 raised to 24 (72 left)\n- Flop: Seat 2 called 40 (32 left)\n- Turn: Seat 2 bets 120? That's impossible with 32 left. Unless the \"bet 120\" is actually an all-in for his remaining 32 chips. But the prompt says \"bet 120\" and \"amount to call: 120\". \n\nActually, looking at the prompt again: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 96 chips\" - that might be his current stack, not starting stack. So he has 96 chips NOW, before the turn bet. That means:\n- Preflop: Started with X chips, raised to 24\n- Flop: Called 40 \n- Turn: Has 96 chips left, bets 120? That's still more than his stack. Unless 120 is the bet size but he's actually all-in for less. The prompt says \"bet 120\" but he might be all-in for his remaining 96.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me assume Kimi-K2 is essentially all-in or near all-in with this bet.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from history:**\n- Kimi-K2: From hand 50, showed aggressive preflop raising with A7o. Hand 51 won with K5o (trips). Hand 59 folded to my flop bet with 66. Generally seems somewhat loose but not hyper-aggressive.\n- MiniMax-M2: From hand 58, bet turn with marginal hand, won with bet on river.\n\n**My situation:** I have 217 chips total. Calling 120 would leave me with 97 chips (12.1 BB). That's a significant portion of my stack.\n\n**Hand strength:** My deuces are basically bluff catchers at best. The board has a pair of 9s, so someone could have a 9 for trips, or an overpair, or a flush draw (two clubs on board). The turn 9h pairs the board, making it less likely someone has a 9 (though still possible).\n\n**Potential draws:** Flush draw with clubs, straight draws (4-6, 6-8, etc.).\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. Pot odds: 27.8% needed\n2. My equity:"

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand: #60**\n- My position: SB (Seat 3)\n- My cards: 2s 2h (pocket deuces)\n- My stack: 217 chips (27.1 BB)\n- Board: 5c 9d 3c 9h (turn just dealt)\n- Pot: 312 chips\n- Opponents: \n  - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (96 chips) - just bet 120 on turn\n  - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (108 chips) - checked turn\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Preflop: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 24, I called 20, Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 16\n- Flop: 5c 9d 3c - I checked, Seat 4 bet 40, Seat 2 called 40, I called 40\n- Turn: 9h - I checked, Seat 4 checked, Seat 2 bet 120\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 120 to win 432 (312 + 120). That's 120/432 = 27.8% pot odds.\n\n**My hand analysis:** I have pocket deuces. Board is 5c 9d 3c 9h. I have:\n- No pair on board (deuces are undercards to board)\n- Backdoor straight draw: I need a 4 for wheel straight (A-2-3-4-5)\n- Very weak hand - essentially hoping for a 2 on river for trips\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n1. Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has 96 chips total, just bet 120 (more than his stack? Wait, he started with 96 chips, but bet 120? That seems impossible. Let me check: He had 96 chips preflop, called 40 on flop (56 left), now bets 120? That's an all-in bet then. Actually, he must have 56 chips left and is betting all-in for 56, not 120. But the prompt says \"bet 120\" and \"amount to call: 120\". Let me re-examine: Pot is 312, he bets 120, but he only has 96 total? Something doesn't add up. Maybe I misread stack sizes or there's a discrepancy.)\n\nWait, let me recalculate stacks from beginning:\n- Preflop: Seat 2 started with 96 chips\n- Preflop action: Seat 2 raised to 24 (72 left)\n- Flop: Seat 2 called 40 (32 left)\n- Turn: Seat 2 bets 120? That's impossible with 32 left. Unless the \"bet 120\" is actually an all-in for his remaining 32 chips. But the prompt says \"bet 120\" and \"amount to call: 120\". \n\nActually, looking at the prompt again: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 96 chips\" - that might be his current stack, not starting stack. So he has 96 chips NOW, before the turn bet. That means:\n- Preflop: Started with X chips, raised to 24\n- Flop: Called 40 \n- Turn: Has 96 chips left, bets 120? That's still more than his stack. Unless 120 is the bet size but he's actually all-in for less. The prompt says \"bet 120\" but he might be all-in for his remaining 96.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me assume Kimi-K2 is essentially all-in or near all-in with this bet.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from history:**\n- Kimi-K2: From hand 50, showed aggressive preflop raising with A7o. Hand 51 won with K5o (trips). Hand 59 folded to my flop bet with 66. Generally seems somewhat loose but not hyper-aggressive.\n- MiniMax-M2: From hand 58, bet turn with marginal hand, won with bet on river.\n\n**My situation:** I have 217 chips total. Calling 120 would leave me with 97 chips (12.1 BB). That's a significant portion of my stack.\n\n**Hand strength:** My deuces are basically bluff catchers at best. The board has a pair of 9s, so someone could have a 9 for trips, or an overpair, or a flush draw (two clubs on board). The turn 9h pairs the board, making it less likely someone has a 9 (though still possible).\n\n**Potential draws:** Flush draw with clubs, straight draws (4-6, 6-8, etc.).\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. Pot odds: 27.8% needed\n2. My equity:",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have more information. Let me analyze:\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- Kimi-K2: Seems passive in recent hands - checking and calling mostly, folding to aggression. In hand 59, folded to my flop bet with 66. Not showing much aggression postflop.\n- MiniMax-M2: Has shown some aggression - raised preflop in hand 54, bet turn and river in hand 58. But checked this turn.\n\n**Current hand analysis:**\nBoard: 5c 9d 3c 9h\nMy hand: 2s 2h\n\nI have pocket deuces. The board has a pair of 9s. My hand is very weak - basically hoping for a 2 on river (2 outs, ~4.5% chance). There's a backdoor straight draw if a 4 comes (wheel: A-2-3-4-5), but that's unlikely.\n\n**Pot odds:** Need to call 120 to win 432 (312 + 120) = 27.8% equity needed.\n\n**My equity against likely hands:**\n- If opponent has a 9: I have ~2% equity (only hitting a 2)\n- If opponent has overpair (TT+): I have ~2% equity  \n- If opponent has flush draw: I have ~18% equity\n- If opponent has straight draw: I have ~18% equity\n- If opponent has air/bluff: I'm ahead but vulnerable\n\n**Stack considerations:** I have 217 chips. Calling 120 leaves me with 97 (12.1 BB). That's a significant portion of my stack.\n\n**Opponent betting pattern analysis:**\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Preflop raiser, called flop bet, now bets turn. Given his passive history, this bet looks strong. He might have a 9, an overpair, or a strong draw.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Bet flop, checked turn. Could have a draw, medium pair, or was betting flop for protection.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 27.1 BB, I'm not desperate. Losing 120 chips would leave me with 12.1 BB, which is short but playable. However, calling with such weak equity is questionable.\n\n**Possible scenarios:**\n1. Kimi-K2 has a 9 (trips) - very likely given board paired, he's betting big\n2. Kimi-K2 has overpair (TT-AA) - also likely\n3. Kimi-K2 has flush draw - possible but less likely given passive history\n4. Kimi-K2 has straight draw - possible\n5. Kimi-K2 is bluffing - possible but less likely given passive history\n\nMy equity against trips or overpair is only ~2%. Against a draw, it's ~18%. I need 27.8% equity to break even on pot odds. Even against a draw, I don't have enough equity.\n\n**Additional factor:** There's still MiniMax-M2 to act behind me if I call. He checked turn but could be trapping or have a strong hand.\n\n**Conclusion:** With weak pocket deuces on a paired board, facing a large bet from a player who has shown passive tendencies (making this bet look strong), and needing 27.8% equity when I likely have 2-18% equity at best, this is a clear fold. Preserving my 27.1 BB stack is more important than gambling with poor odds.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket deuces are too weak on 9-9-5-3 board.

The big blind (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 239 chips (14.9 BB). Seat 2 has folded.\n\nLooking at the opponent tendencies:\n1. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Very short stack (6.25 BB). From the data, I see they've raised preflop a few times (hands 31, 40, 54), but they're in a desperate spot. They posted SB of 8, so they have 92 left after posting. They might be looking to shove with any decent hand.\n\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has 239 chips (14.9 BB). From the data, they seem to play a mix of hands. In hand 52 they raised from SB with K4s. In hand 57 they raised after a limper. They can be aggressive.\n\nMy hand: KTo offsuit on the button. This is a decent hand in position, especially against short stacks. With 13.6 BB, I'm also somewhat short, but not as desperate as MiniMax-M2.\n\nImportant factors:\n- MiniMax-M2 is extremely short (6.25 BB) and will likely shove with a wide range if they decide to play\n- If I call 16 (1 BB), the pot will be 40, and MiniMax-M2 has 92 behind (5.75 BB)\n- If I raise, I could potentially isolate MiniMax-M2 or get Kimi-K2 Thinking to fold\n- Position is good on the button\n\nGiven the stack sizes:\n- MiniMax-M2 is likely to shove with many hands\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking might call a small raise with a decent hand\n- My KTo is ahead of MiniMax-M2's shoving range\n\nI think raising is the best play here. I want to put pressure on the blinds and potentially win the pot preflop. If MiniMax-M2 shoves, I can call with KTo. If Kimi-K2 Thinking calls, I have position.\n\nA standard raise would be to 40-48 (2.5-3 BB). Since minimum raise is to 32, I'll raise to 48 (3x the BB).\n\nLet me calculate: My stack is 217. Raise to 48 leaves me with 169 behind (10.6 BB). That's reasonable.\n\nIf MiniMax-M2 shoves for 100 total (they have 92 behind after SB of 8), I'd need to call 52 more (100 - 48 = 52). Pot would be: 24 (current) + 48 (my raise) + 100 (their shove) = 172. I'd need to call 52 to win 172, getting 3.3:1 odds. That's a clear call with KTo.\n\nIf Kimi-K2 Thinking calls or raises, I'll have to reassess.\n\nDecision: Raise to 48."

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm on the button with Ks Td, 13.6 BB stack. The small blind (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) has 100 chips (6.25 BB) and is very short. The big blind (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 239 chips (14.9 BB). Seat 2 has folded.\n\nLooking at the opponent tendencies:\n1. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Very short stack (6.25 BB). From the data, I see they've raised preflop a few times (hands 31, 40, 54), but they're in a desperate spot. They posted SB of 8, so they have 92 left after posting. They might be looking to shove with any decent hand.\n\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has 239 chips (14.9 BB). From the data, they seem to play a mix of hands. In hand 52 they raised from SB with K4s. In hand 57 they raised after a limper. They can be aggressive.\n\nMy hand: KTo offsuit on the button. This is a decent hand in position, especially against short stacks. With 13.6 BB, I'm also somewhat short, but not as desperate as MiniMax-M2.\n\nImportant factors:\n- MiniMax-M2 is extremely short (6.25 BB) and will likely shove with a wide range if they decide to play\n- If I call 16 (1 BB), the pot will be 40, and MiniMax-M2 has 92 behind (5.75 BB)\n- If I raise, I could potentially isolate MiniMax-M2 or get Kimi-K2 Thinking to fold\n- Position is good on the button\n\nGiven the stack sizes:\n- MiniMax-M2 is likely to shove with many hands\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking might call a small raise with a decent hand\n- My KTo is ahead of MiniMax-M2's shoving range\n\nI think raising is the best play here. I want to put pressure on the blinds and potentially win the pot preflop. If MiniMax-M2 shoves, I can call with KTo. If Kimi-K2 Thinking calls, I have position.\n\nA standard raise would be to 40-48 (2.5-3 BB). Since minimum raise is to 32, I'll raise to 48 (3x the BB).\n\nLet me calculate: My stack is 217. Raise to 48 leaves me with 169 behind (10.6 BB). That's reasonable.\n\nIf MiniMax-M2 shoves for 100 total (they have 92 behind after SB of 8), I'd need to call 52 more (100 - 48 = 52). Pot would be: 24 (current) + 48 (my raise) + 100 (their shove) = 172. I'd need to call 52 to win 172, getting 3.3:1 odds. That's a clear call with KTo.\n\nIf Kimi-K2 Thinking calls or raises, I'll have to reassess.\n\nDecision: Raise to 48.",

Their showdown hands include weak pairs and suited connectors.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop 10 times, also aggressive. Showdown hands include Ts6s and pocket tens.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised 3 times, less aggressive. Showdown shows K4o.\n\nMy own history: I've been playing reasonably tight. I won the last hand with KTo from BTN with a raise.\n\nGiven my position (UTG) with a terrible hand (4d 8h), I should fold. This is an easy fold from early position with such weak cards. I have 15.1 BB, which is short but not desperate yet. There are still players to act behind me (Seat 4 and the button is empty since Seat 5 folded). Calling or raising with 84o from UTG would be terrible poker.\n\nThe pot is 24, I need to call 16. Even if I call, I'll be out of position against potentially multiple players. The hand has almost no potential - not suited, not connected, low cards. Even if I flop a pair, it's likely dominated.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 15.1 BB, which is short but I can wait for a better spot. Folding preserves my stack for a better opportunity.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors. Looking at the showdown hands of opponents, they sometimes play weak hands too, but that doesn't justify playing 84o from UTG.\n\nDecision: Fold."

Blinds are 8/16. Seat 1 (SB) posted 8, Seat 2 (BB) posted 16. I need to act first.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop 8 times in 61 hands, showing some aggression. Their showdown hands include weak pairs and suited connectors.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop 10 times, also aggressive. Showdown hands include Ts6s and pocket tens.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised 3 times, less aggressive. Showdown shows K4o.\n\nMy own history: I've been playing reasonably tight. I won the last hand with KTo from BTN with a raise.\n\nGiven my position (UTG) with a terrible hand (4d 8h), I should fold. This is an easy fold from early position with such weak cards. I have 15.1 BB, which is short but not desperate yet. There are still players to act behind me (Seat 4 and the button is empty since Seat 5 folded). Calling or raising with 84o from UTG would be terrible poker.\n\nThe pot is 24, I need to call 16. Even if I call, I'll be out of position against potentially multiple players. The hand has almost no potential - not suited, not connected, low cards. Even if I flop a pair, it's likely dominated.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 15.1 BB, which is short but I can wait for a better spot. Folding preserves my stack for a better opportunity.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors. Looking at the showdown hands of opponents, they sometimes play weak hands too, but that doesn't justify playing 84o from UTG.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the button with 3d Td. My stack is 241 chips (15.1 BB). Blinds are 8/16. I've posted the small blind (8 chips). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted the big blind (16 chips). Seats 1 and 2 folded. So it's just me and the big blind.\n\nI need to call 8 more chips to see the flop (total 16 including my SB). The pot is currently 24 chips (8 SB + 16 BB).\n\nLooking at opponent data: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 108 chips (6.75 BB). They're the big blind. From the opponent data, I can see:\n- They've been fairly active preflop, with a mix of folds, calls, and raises\n- In hand #62, they raised to 32 preflop\n- In hand #60, they called 16 preflop from the BB\n- In hand #58, they called 8 preflop (likely from SB)\n\nMy hand: 3d Td is not great. Ten-three suited is a weak hand. However, I'm on the button against just the big blind, which gives me position advantage. The opponent has a short stack (108 chips, 6.75 BB) which might make them more likely to defend their blind with a wide range.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 chips to win 24 chips, which is 3:1 pot odds (25% equity needed). With T3s, I probably have around 35-40% equity against a random hand, so pot odds are favorable.\n\nHowever, I have position and can potentially steal the blinds with a raise. The minimum raise is to 32 (total). My stack is 241, so I could raise. But T3s is a weak hand to raise with, even on the button against a short stack.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 15.1 BB, which is short but not critical. The opponent has only 6.75 BB, which is very short. They might be desperate and call/shove with a wide range.\n\nGiven the opponent's short stack and my position, I think the best play is to fold. T3s is just too weak, even with position. The 8 chips to call is small, but I'd be putting money in with a very weak hand out of position on the flop (well, actually I have position, but still weak hand).\n\nActually wait - I'm on the button, so I have position post-flop. But still, T3s is very weak. The suited aspect gives some flush potential, but it's a low flush.\n\nLet me think about raising: If I raise to 32 (2x BB over the 16), that's a standard raise. The opponent has 108 total, so they'd need to call 16 more (from their 16 BB to 32). They might defend with a wide range given their short stack. If they shove, I'd have to call 209 more to win ~140 total pot (24 + 108 + 32?). Actually if they shove for 108 total, I'd have to call 76 more (108 - 32 I already put in). That would be a tough spot with T3s.\n\nBetter to just fold and preserve my stack. 8 chips is only 0.5 BB, but it's still 3.3% of my stack. Not worth it with such a weak hand.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Button position is good for stealing, but both opponents are short-stacked (MiniMax-M2 has 7.75 BB, Kimi-K2 Thinking has 13.4 BB) and may call/shove wider. Hand doesn't play well against likely calling ranges. Better to preserve chips for stronger spots.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop situation. I'm on the button with 9\u2660 7\u2663. My stack is 241 chips (15.1 BB). Blinds are 8/16. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 8, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB 16. Seat 2 folded. It's my action.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB): Has folded 9 out of last 10 hands preflop, only raised once (hand 57). Seems tight/passive.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB): Has shown some aggression - raised preflop in hand 62, called in hand 60 and bet postflop. Might defend SB with wider range.\n\nMy hand: 9\u2660 7\u2663 is a weak offsuit connector. From button position, I could consider playing speculative hands, but with only 15 BB, stack preservation is important. However, button is the best position, and both opponents behind have shown tendency to fold preflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 16 to win pot of 24. That's 1:1.5 odds (need 40% equity). 97o likely has less than 40% equity against random hands, but against tight opponents who might fold often, I could consider stealing.\n\nTournament considerations: With 15 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate. I should look for better spots. However, button is a good stealing position.\n\nAlternative: I could raise to steal. Minimum raise to 32 (double the BB). That's 32 chips out of my 241 stack (13%). If successful, I win 24 chips uncontested. If called, I'm out of position with a weak hand.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's stack: 124 chips (7.75 BB) - very short. He might be desperate and call/shove wider. Kimi-K2 Thinking has 215 chips (13.4 BB) - also somewhat short.\n\nGiven my hand strength is poor, and both opponents are somewhat short-stacked (especially MiniMax-M2), they might be more likely to call/shove. 97o doesn't play well against shoving ranges.\n\nI think the best play is to fold. Wait for a better spot. My position is good, but the hand is too weak to invest chips with a short stack. Let me check if I've been playing too tight recently. Looking at my last few hands: I won hand 61 with K\u2660 T\u2666 from button with a raise, won hand 63 from BB with J\u2663 2\u2663 (just checked), folded other marginal hands. Seems reasonable.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

My stack is 241 chips (15.1 BB), which is short but not critically short. The blinds are 8/16.\n\nLooking at opponent actions:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): In hand #65, they raised preflop from SB to 32 (2x BB raise) with 8 BB already posted. Shows some aggression.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has folded preflop in recent hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Called a raise in hand #65, then bet on turn.\n\nMy position is UTG, which is the worst position at the table. With QJo, I'm likely to be dominated by better hands from later positions. This hand doesn't play well multi-way and is vulnerable to raises behind me.\n\nGiven my short stack (15.1 BB), I need to be careful about committing chips with marginal hands. However, I could consider raising to steal the blinds, but from UTG with this hand, that's risky with 3 players left to act.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 16 to win 24 (current pot). That's 1.5:1 odds, but the hand is weak.\n\nTournament considerations: With 15.1 BB, I'm not in push/fold territory yet, but getting close. I should wait for better spots.\n\nBetter to fold QJo from UTG with a short stack. I can find better opportunities in later positions or with stronger hands.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"QJo offsuit is too weak from UTG with 15.1 BB.

          "content": "Let me analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with pocket Jacks (Js Jd). My stack is 225 chips (14.1 BB). The opponent in seat 2 (SB) raised to 48 total (32 more for me to call). The pot is currently 64 chips (16 from blinds + 48 from opponent).\n\nLooking at opponent's history: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop 14 times. Their raise amounts vary: 6, 8, 12, 24, 60, 164. The most recent raises were 24 chips (hands 56 and 60). In hand 50, they raised to 60 then reraised to 164 all-in.\n\nThe current raise to 48 is larger than their typical 24-chip raises but not huge. This could indicate a stronger hand than their usual opening range.\n\nMy hand: Pocket Jacks is a strong hand but vulnerable. It's ahead of most unpaired hands but behind QQ, KK, AA. At 14.1 BB effective stack, I need to consider my options:\n\n1. **Fold**: Too weak for JJ with these stack sizes\n2. **Call**: Put in 32 more (total 48) to see a flop with 225 stack\n3. **Raise**: Minimum raise to 80, could go bigger\n\nPot odds: I need to call 32 to win 96 (64 current pot + 32 my call). That's 1:3 pot odds, requiring ~25% equity.\n\nWith JJ against a typical SB opening range, I have well over 25% equity. Even against a tighter range, JJ has good equity.\n\nStack sizes: I have 225, opponent has 344. If I raise to say 80, I'd have 145 left (9 BB) with pot of ~144. This would commit me.\n\nGiven my stack size (14.1 BB), JJ is definitely a raise/call hand. I should 3-bet. Looking at typical tournament strategy with 14 BB: JJ is a premium hand that should be played aggressively.\n\nIf I raise to 80 (minimum), opponent might call or shove. If they shove, I'd have to call 145 more into pot of ~369 (80+80+225ish). That would be about 2:1 pot odds, requiring ~33% equity. JJ vs a shoving range (probably QQ+, AK, maybe AQ) would have around 40% equity against QQ+/AK, so it's a call.\n\nActually, let me think: At 14 BB, standard play is to shove or raise/call with JJ. Raising to 80 leaves me with 9 BB, which is awkward if I miss the flop.\n\nAlternative: Go all-in now (225 total). This puts maximum pressure and avoids post-flop decisions. With JJ and 14 BB, a shove is reasonable.\n\nBut opponent has me covered (344 vs 225). If I shove and they call with a better hand, I'm out.\n\nGiven opponent's raising history seems somewhat loose (many small raises), they might not have a monster. Their 48 raise is larger than usual though.\n\nLet me check if there are any showdowns with this opponent to see their ranges. From the recall data, I see two showdowns: hand 30 they had Ts6s (weak), hand 50 they had ThTs (pocket tens). So they do play pocket pairs.\n\nDecision: With 14 BB and JJ in the BB facing a SB raise, I should 3-bet. A shove of 225 might get folds from many hands. But if I raise smaller to 80, I keep some fold equity and can get away if an A, K, Q flops.\n\nActually, with 225 stack and pot of 64, a raise to 80 commits 64 more (total 80). Then I have 145 left. The pot would be 144. If opponent calls, pot is 160, and I have 145 behind (less than pot). This is essentially committed.\n\nSo raising to 80 is almost committing myself. Better to shove or call.\n\nCalling is also an option: see a flop with position (they act first post-flop). But with JJ and such a short stack, I want to get it in preflop or on safe flops.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 14.1 BB, which is short but not desperate. Double-up would give me 28 BB. A loss would eliminate me.\n\nI think the best play is to shove. JJ is too strong to fold, and raising small creates awkward post-flop play. Shove maximizes fold equity and gets value from worse hands that might call (TT, 99, AQ, AK).\n\nLet me calculate: If I shove to 225, opponent has to call 177 more"

The most recent raises were 24 chips (hands 56 and 60). In hand 50, they raised to 60 then reraised to 164 all-in.\n\nThe current raise to 48 is larger than their typical 24-chip raises but not huge. This could indicate a stronger hand than their usual opening range.\n\nMy hand: Pocket Jacks is a strong hand but vulnerable. It's ahead of most unpaired hands but behind QQ, KK, AA. At 14.1 BB effective stack, I need to consider my options:\n\n1. **Fold**: Too weak for JJ with these stack sizes\n2. **Call**: Put in 32 more (total 48) to see a flop with 225 stack\n3. **Raise**: Minimum raise to 80, could go bigger\n\nPot odds: I need to call 32 to win 96 (64 current pot + 32 my call). That's 1:3 pot odds, requiring ~25% equity.\n\nWith JJ against a typical SB opening range, I have well over 25% equity. Even against a tighter range, JJ has good equity.\n\nStack sizes: I have 225, opponent has 344. If I raise to say 80, I'd have 145 left (9 BB) with pot of ~144. This would commit me.\n\nGiven my stack size (14.1 BB), JJ is definitely a raise/call hand. I should 3-bet. Looking at typical tournament strategy with 14 BB: JJ is a premium hand that should be played aggressively.\n\nIf I raise to 80 (minimum), opponent might call or shove. If they shove, I'd have to call 145 more into pot of ~369 (80+80+225ish). That would be about 2:1 pot odds, requiring ~33% equity. JJ vs a shoving range (probably QQ+, AK, maybe AQ) would have around 40% equity against QQ+/AK, so it's a call.\n\nActually, let me think: At 14 BB, standard play is to shove or raise/call with JJ. Raising to 80 leaves me with 9 BB, which is awkward if I miss the flop.\n\nAlternative: Go all-in now (225 total). This puts maximum pressure and avoids post-flop decisions. With JJ and 14 BB, a shove is reasonable.\n\nBut opponent has me covered (344 vs 225). If I shove and they call with a better hand, I'm out.\n\nGiven opponent's raising history seems somewhat loose (many small raises), they might not have a monster. Their 48 raise is larger than usual though.\n\nLet me check if there are any showdowns with this opponent to see their ranges. From the recall data, I see two showdowns: hand 30 they had Ts6s (weak), hand 50 they had ThTs (pocket tens). So they do play pocket pairs.\n\nDecision: With 14 BB and JJ in the BB facing a SB raise, I should 3-bet. A shove of 225 might get folds from many hands. But if I raise smaller to 80, I keep some fold equity and can get away if an A, K, Q flops.\n\nActually, with 225 stack and pot of 64, a raise to 80 commits 64 more (total 80). Then I have 145 left. The pot would be 144. If opponent calls, pot is 160, and I have 145 behind (less than pot). This is essentially committed.\n\nSo raising to 80 is almost committing myself. Better to shove or call.\n\nCalling is also an option: see a flop with position (they act first post-flop). But with JJ and such a short stack, I want to get it in preflop or on safe flops.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 14.1 BB, which is short but not desperate. Double-up would give me 28 BB. A loss would eliminate me.\n\nI think the best play is to shove. JJ is too strong to fold, and raising small creates awkward post-flop play. Shove maximizes fold equity and gets value from worse hands that might call (TT, 99, AQ, AK).\n\nLet me calculate: If I shove to 225, opponent has to call 177 more",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand #67 - Turn**\n- My cards: Js Jd (pocket jacks)\n- Board: Kd 6c 3c 9d\n- My stack: 16 chips (1.0 BB)\n- Pot: 450 chips\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) with 167 chips\n- Action: Opponent checked to me on the turn\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check\n\nKey observations:\n1. I'm in the BB with pocket jacks\n2. Preflop action: Seat 2 (SB) raised to 48, I shoved all-in for 225 (my whole stack was 241 at that time?), wait let me recalculate\n\nWait, there's something off. Let me reconstruct the preflop action:\n- Seat 2 (SB) posted 8\n- I (BB) posted 16  \n- Seat 4 folded\n- Seat 1 folded\n- Seat 2 raised to 48 (so added 40 more)\n- I raised to 225 (all-in for my stack)\n\nBut my current stack is 16 chips, which suggests I have 16 chips left after the preflop action? Actually, if I had 241 chips preflop and raised to 225, I'd have 16 left. That makes sense.\n\nBut the pot is 450 chips. Let me calculate:\n- My initial BB: 16\n- Seat 2's initial SB: 8\n- Seat 2's raise to 48: added 40\n- My raise to 225: added 209 (225 - 16)\n- Seat 2 called 177 more (225 - 48)\nTotal pot: 16 + 8 + 40 + 209 + 177 = 450 \u2713\n\nSo I have 16 chips left, which is exactly 1 BB. The board is Kd 6c 3c 9d. I have pocket jacks. The opponent checked to me on the turn.\n\nMy hand: JJ on Kd 6c 3c 9d board. This is a marginal spot. The king on the board is bad for my jacks. Opponent could have:\n- AK, KQ, KJ, KT (would have called my preflop shove)\n- AA, KK, QQ (would have called)\n- Pairs like TT, 99, 88, etc.\n- Possibly some flush draws with clubs or diamonds\n\nThe opponent checked the turn after checking the flop. This could mean:\n1. They have a marginal hand and are checking to control pot size\n2. They have a draw and are checking to see a free river\n3. They have a monster and are trapping\n\nGiven the pot is 450 and I only have 16 chips left (3.5% of the pot), I'm essentially all-in already. Any bet I make would be my last 16 chips.\n\nWith only 16 chips left, I should consider:\n- If I check, we see a free river\n- If I bet, I'm committing my last chips\n\nMy hand strength: JJ on K-high board. I'm likely behind any hand with a K, but could be ahead of smaller pairs or draws. The opponent's preflop call of my shove suggests a decent hand.\n\nGiven I have only 16 chips (1 BB) and the pot is 450, I'm getting incredible pot odds on any river. I should just check and see the river for free. If I'm ahead, I want to see if a scare card comes. If I'm behind, I don't want to put more money in.\n\nActually, wait - I only have \"fold\" or \"check\" as legal actions. I can't bet. So my only options are to check or fold. Folding would be terrible - I'd give up my chance to win a 450 pot with 16 chips invested.\n\nDecision: Check. See the river for free, hope to improve or that my jacks are good.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Only 16 chips remaining (1 BB) with 450 pot.

Given infinite pot odds (free to check), must see if Jacks are good.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully.\n\nI'm in the BB with Js Jd. My stack is 16 chips (1 BB). The board is Kd 6c 3c 9d 8s. The pot is 450 chips. Opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 167 chips and just checked the river.\n\nLooking at the hand history:\n- Preflop: I posted BB 16, opponent raised to 48, I re-raised to 225 (which was effectively all-in since I only have 16 chips total? Wait, that doesn't make sense... Let me think: If I have 16 chips total, how could I raise to 225? This must be a tournament where I have 16 chips remaining, but the preflop action shows I raised to 225. That seems impossible unless... maybe the stack display is wrong or this is a different format.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes: I have 16 chips, opponent has 167, and I raised to 225 preflop. That's mathematically impossible. Unless... maybe the 16 chips is what I have left after posting the blind? No, that still doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding: \"Your Stack: 16 chips (1.0 BB)\" - but I posted BB of 16, so maybe I started with 32? Or perhaps the display shows my remaining stack after posting? Let me check the preflop action again: \"Seat 3 post_bb 16\" and then \"Seat 3 raise 225\". If I only had 16 total, I couldn't raise to 225.\n\nThis suggests I actually have more chips than displayed, or there's an error. But regardless, the river decision: opponent checked, amount to call is 0, legal actions are fold or check.\n\nGiven that opponent checked the river on a board of Kd 6c 3c 9d 8s, with my pocket Jacks:\n- Board has a King high, which likely hit opponent's raising range\n- There are straight draws (7T for straight, but board shows 6-8-9, so T7 would make a straight, but that's less likely)\n- There are flush draws (clubs and diamonds)\n- My hand is essentially a pair of Jacks, which might be good if opponent has missed draws or smaller pairs\n\nBut opponent called my preflop 3-bet (which was large), then checked flop, turn, and river. This suggests either:\n1. They have a weak hand that missed (like AQ, AJ, TT, etc.)\n2. They have a medium strength hand and are playing cautiously\n3. They have a monster and are trapping (less likely since they checked all streets)\n\nGiven the pot is 450 chips and I have only 16 chips (if that's accurate), this is a huge pot relative to my stack. I should check and see a showdown. Folding would be terrible since it's free to check.\n\nBut wait, I need to understand my actual chip situation. If I only have 16 chips, I'm essentially all-in already. The fact that I can check suggests I still have chips behind? Or maybe the \"fold\" option is available because technically I could fold, but that would be absurd.\n\nActually, looking at the river action: \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check\". This means I can either check (showdown) or fold (forfeit). Since it costs nothing to check, I should absolutely check and see if my Jacks are good.\n\nLet me think about opponent's range: They raised preflop, called a 3-bet, then checked three streets. Their range could include: AK, KQ, KJ, KT, maybe QQ, maybe missed flush draws. My Jacks might be good against some of these.\n\nGiven the pot odds (infinite, since it's free to check), I must check.\n\nBut there's one more consideration: If I'm actually all-in (which seems likely given my small stack), then checking is automatic. The interface is just showing me the option to check for showdown.\n\nI'll check.",

          "content": "I need to respond with a JSON object in the specified format. The user is asking for a poker decision in a tournament hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\nPosition: SB (small blind)\nMy cards: 9h Td (9 of hearts, 10 of diamonds)\nMy stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB) - I'm extremely short-stacked\nBlinds: 8/16\nPot: 72 chips\nActions: Seat 2 raised to 48 total, making it 40 for me to call\nMinimum raise to: 80 (but I only have 8 chips total)\nLegal actions: fold, call\n\nMy stack is only 8 chips, and I've already posted 8 as the small blind. So I have 0 chips left after posting. Actually wait, my stack is 8 chips total, and I posted 8 as SB, so I have 0 chips behind. But the amount to call is 40? That doesn't make sense - if I only have 8 chips total, I can't call 40.\n\nLet me re-examine: \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 8\". So I have 8 chips total, I post 8 as SB, leaving me with 0. But then \"Amount to call: 40\" - this must mean I need to call an additional 40, but I only have 0 chips. This seems like an all-in situation where my 8 chips is already in as the SB.\n\nActually, I think the confusion is: my stack is 8 chips, I posted SB of 8, so I'm all-in with my 8 chips. The raise to 48 by seat 2 means the total bet is 48. Since I only have 8 total, I can only call with my remaining 0 chips? Or maybe the 8 chips is what I have AFTER posting SB?\n\nWait, let me think: \"Your Stack: 8 chips\" likely means current stack size. Then \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 8\" - so I post 8 from my stack, leaving me with 0. The pot is 72: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 48 = 72. Actually SB 8 + BB 16 = 24, plus raise 48 = 72.\n\nI have 9h Td, which is not a great hand, but I'm effectively all-in with 8 chips (0.5 BB). With such a short stack, I should probably call since I'm getting good pot odds. The pot is 72 and it costs me 0 more to call (since I'm already all-in with my 8).\n\nActually, if I'm already all-in with my 8, then \"call\" would mean matching the bet, but I can't match 48 with only 8. In poker, when you're all-in for less than a full bet, you can only win the portion of the pot that you contributed to. So I should call since I'm already all-in.\n\nBut the interface says \"Amount to call: 40\" and \"Legal actions: fold, call\". If I fold, I forfeit my 8 chips. If I call, I put in 40 more, but I only have 8 total. This doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe the 8 chips is what I have BEFORE posting SB? So I have 8 chips, post SB of 8, leaving me with 0. Then \"Amount to call: 40\" means I need to call 40 more, but I have 0. This is confusing.\n\nLet me check: In poker, when you're in the SB and face a raise, you need to call the difference between the raise and your SB. SB posted 8, raise is to 48, so need to call 40 more. But if I only have 8 total, I can't call 40.\n\nI think the system might be treating me as having 8 chips total, and I've already put in 8 as SB. So I'm effectively all-in. The \"call\" action would be calling all-in with my remaining 0.\n\nGiven I have 9T offsuit, not a great hand, but with 0.5 BB stack, I'm basically forced to go all-in with any two cards. The pot odds are enormous: I'm putting in 0 more to potentially win 72.\n\nActually, let me calculate: If I call, I put in 0 more (since I'm already all-in). The pot is 72. If I win, I get 72. If I lose, I lose my 8 that's already in. But I'm getting infinite pot odds since it costs 0 more.\n\nBut wait, if I fold, I lose my 8 chips immediately. If"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with a JSON object in the specified format. The user is asking for a poker decision in a tournament hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\nPosition: SB (small blind)\nMy cards: 9h Td (9 of hearts, 10 of diamonds)\nMy stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB) - I'm extremely short-stacked\nBlinds: 8/16\nPot: 72 chips\nActions: Seat 2 raised to 48 total, making it 40 for me to call\nMinimum raise to: 80 (but I only have 8 chips total)\nLegal actions: fold, call\n\nMy stack is only 8 chips, and I've already posted 8 as the small blind. So I have 0 chips left after posting. Actually wait, my stack is 8 chips total, and I posted 8 as SB, so I have 0 chips behind. But the amount to call is 40? That doesn't make sense - if I only have 8 chips total, I can't call 40.\n\nLet me re-examine: \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 8\". So I have 8 chips total, I post 8 as SB, leaving me with 0. But then \"Amount to call: 40\" - this must mean I need to call an additional 40, but I only have 0 chips. This seems like an all-in situation where my 8 chips is already in as the SB.\n\nActually, I think the confusion is: my stack is 8 chips, I posted SB of 8, so I'm all-in with my 8 chips. The raise to 48 by seat 2 means the total bet is 48. Since I only have 8 total, I can only call with my remaining 0 chips? Or maybe the 8 chips is what I have AFTER posting SB?\n\nWait, let me think: \"Your Stack: 8 chips\" likely means current stack size. Then \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 8\" - so I post 8 from my stack, leaving me with 0. The pot is 72: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 48 = 72. Actually SB 8 + BB 16 = 24, plus raise 48 = 72.\n\nI have 9h Td, which is not a great hand, but I'm effectively all-in with 8 chips (0.5 BB). With such a short stack, I should probably call since I'm getting good pot odds. The pot is 72 and it costs me 0 more to call (since I'm already all-in with my 8).\n\nActually, if I'm already all-in with my 8, then \"call\" would mean matching the bet, but I can't match 48 with only 8. In poker, when you're all-in for less than a full bet, you can only win the portion of the pot that you contributed to. So I should call since I'm already all-in.\n\nBut the interface says \"Amount to call: 40\" and \"Legal actions: fold, call\". If I fold, I forfeit my 8 chips. If I call, I put in 40 more, but I only have 8 total. This doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe the 8 chips is what I have BEFORE posting SB? So I have 8 chips, post SB of 8, leaving me with 0. Then \"Amount to call: 40\" means I need to call 40 more, but I have 0. This is confusing.\n\nLet me check: In poker, when you're in the SB and face a raise, you need to call the difference between the raise and your SB. SB posted 8, raise is to 48, so need to call 40 more. But if I only have 8 total, I can't call 40.\n\nI think the system might be treating me as having 8 chips total, and I've already put in 8 as SB. So I'm effectively all-in. The \"call\" action would be calling all-in with my remaining 0.\n\nGiven I have 9T offsuit, not a great hand, but with 0.5 BB stack, I'm basically forced to go all-in with any two cards. The pot odds are enormous: I'm putting in 0 more to potentially win 72.\n\nActually, let me calculate: If I call, I put in 0 more (since I'm already all-in). The pot is 72. If I win, I get 72. If I lose, I lose my 8 that's already in. But I'm getting infinite pot odds since it costs 0 more.\n\nBut wait, if I fold, I lose my 8 chips immediately. If",

I'm essentially in push-or-fold territory.\n\n2. **Position**: Button is great, but with only 2 BB, position matters less.\n\n3. **Hand strength**: AJo is a strong hand, especially for a 2 BB stack. It's well above the shoving range for this stack depth.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, 175 chips) - Has shown both calling and raising tendencies preflop. Has raised to 32 in recent hands.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB, 140 chips) - Just posted SB, has been folding a lot recently but called twice and raised once in recent history.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 24 chips, I need to call 16. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, which is good. If I shove for 32 total, I'm risking 16 more chips to win 40 total (24 current + 16 BB call).\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With only 2 BB, I need to double up soon. This is likely one of my last chances to play a hand with decent equity.\n\n7. **Action considerations**: \n   - Fold: Not great with AJo and 2 BB\n   - Call: Not ideal either - just calling leaves me with 16 chips (1 BB) and out of position postflop\n   - Raise/shove: Best option - I can go all-in for 32 total (which is just a min-raise from the current bet)\n\nGiven my stack size, AJo is a clear shove. Even if the BB has a strong hand, I have decent equity. The SB has been folding a lot recently, so they might fold. The BB might call with a wider range given the pot odds they'll be getting.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise: it says minimum raise to 32. That means if I raise to 32 total, I'm going all-in (since my stack is 32). That's perfect.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. The BB has raised to 32 recently (hand #65), so they might be aggressive. But with AJo and 2 BB, I have to take this spot."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n1. **My situation**: I'm on the button with AJo, stack is only 32 chips (2 BB). This is extremely short-stacked. I'm essentially in push-or-fold territory.\n\n2. **Position**: Button is great, but with only 2 BB, position matters less.\n\n3. **Hand strength**: AJo is a strong hand, especially for a 2 BB stack. It's well above the shoving range for this stack depth.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, 175 chips) - Has shown both calling and raising tendencies preflop. Has raised to 32 in recent hands.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB, 140 chips) - Just posted SB, has been folding a lot recently but called twice and raised once in recent history.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 24 chips, I need to call 16. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, which is good. If I shove for 32 total, I'm risking 16 more chips to win 40 total (24 current + 16 BB call).\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With only 2 BB, I need to double up soon. This is likely one of my last chances to play a hand with decent equity.\n\n7. **Action considerations**: \n   - Fold: Not great with AJo and 2 BB\n   - Call: Not ideal either - just calling leaves me with 16 chips (1 BB) and out of position postflop\n   - Raise/shove: Best option - I can go all-in for 32 total (which is just a min-raise from the current bet)\n\nGiven my stack size, AJo is a clear shove. Even if the BB has a strong hand, I have decent equity. The SB has been folding a lot recently, so they might fold. The BB might call with a wider range given the pot odds they'll be getting.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise: it says minimum raise to 32. That means if I raise to 32 total, I'm going all-in (since my stack is 32). That's perfect.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. The BB has raised to 32 recently (hand #65), so they might be aggressive. But with AJo and 2 BB, I have to take this spot.",

Hand: A3o - Ace-rag offsuit. Not a great hand, but I have an Ace. \n2. Stack size: 56 chips (3.5 BB). I'm in push-or-fold territory.\n3. Position: UTG - worst position, with 3 players behind me (SB, BB, and MiniMax-M2 in CO? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, seat 5 is folded).\n4. Opponents: \n   - Seat 1 (SB): Kimi-K2 Thinking (167 chips) - seems fairly tight based on recent folds\n   - Seat 2 (BB): Kimi-K2 (585 chips) - has shown some aggression with raises (hand 67, 68)\n   - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (140 chips) - haven't seen much data\n\nWith only 3.5 BB, I should be looking for any decent spot to go all-in. A3o is marginal but might be the best hand I see for a while. The blinds are 8/16, so I'm posting 16 next hand if I fold (I'm UTG, next hand will be in different position though).\n\nIf I call 16, I'll have 40 left (2.5 BB). That's still very short. If I raise all-in to 56, I'm risking my tournament life.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 2 (BB) has shown willingness to call with decent hands (called a big raise with 66 in hand 67). Seat 1 (SB) seems tight.\n\nGiven my stack size, I think I need to be aggressive. A3o is not great, but with 3.5 BB, I can't wait for premium hands. The alternative is folding and hoping for a better spot, but I'll be down to effectively 2.5 BB after posting next blind.\n\nI should consider going all-in. The pot is 24, and if I go all-in for 56, I'm offering 1.75:1 pot odds to callers. They need ~36% equity to call. A3o has ~40% equity against a random hand, but worse against calling ranges.\n\nActually, let me think: If I go all-in, the SB (16 to call 40 more) and BB (0 to call 40 more) get decent odds. But they might fold marginal hands.\n\nGiven tournament survival, maybe I should fold and wait for a better spot? But with 3.5 BB, any spot might be my last.\n\nActually, I just won hand 69 with AJo from BTN with a raise. So I have some momentum.\n\nI think with A3o UTG and such a short stack, it's a push. I'm likely to get called by better aces or pairs, but I have some fold equity.\n\nLet me check if there are antes? No, just blinds.\n\nI'll go all-in."

Opponents: \n   - Seat 1 (SB): Kimi-K2 Thinking (167 chips) - seems fairly tight based on recent folds\n   - Seat 2 (BB): Kimi-K2 (585 chips) - has shown some aggression with raises (hand 67, 68)\n   - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (140 chips) - haven't seen much data\n\nWith only 3.5 BB, I should be looking for any decent spot to go all-in. A3o is marginal but might be the best hand I see for a while. The blinds are 8/16, so I'm posting 16 next hand if I fold (I'm UTG, next hand will be in different position though).\n\nIf I call 16, I'll have 40 left (2.5 BB). That's still very short. If I raise all-in to 56, I'm risking my tournament life.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 2 (BB) has shown willingness to call with decent hands (called a big raise with 66 in hand 67). Seat 1 (SB) seems tight.\n\nGiven my stack size, I think I need to be aggressive. A3o is not great, but with 3.5 BB, I can't wait for premium hands. The alternative is folding and hoping for a better spot, but I'll be down to effectively 2.5 BB after posting next blind.\n\nI should consider going all-in. The pot is 24, and if I go all-in for 56, I'm offering 1.75:1 pot odds to callers. They need ~36% equity to call. A3o has ~40% equity against a random hand, but worse against calling ranges.\n\nActually, let me think: If I go all-in, the SB (16 to call 40 more) and BB (0 to call 40 more) get decent odds. But they might fold marginal hands.\n\nGiven tournament survival, maybe I should fold and wait for a better spot? But with 3.5 BB, any spot might be my last.\n\nActually, I just won hand 69 with AJo from BTN with a raise. So I have some momentum.\n\nI think with A3o UTG and such a short stack, it's a push. I'm likely to get called by better aces or pairs, but I have some fold equity.\n\nLet me check if there are antes? No, just blinds.\n\nI'll go all-in.",

So the raise amount is 48 total, meaning I need to call 32 more (since I already have 16 in as BB). Pot is currently: SB 8 + my BB 16 + raise 48 = 72? Wait, let's calculate: SB posted 8, I posted 16, then Seat 2 raised to 48 total. That means he put in 48 total, which includes his SB 8, so additional 40. The pot is: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise additional 40 = 64 chips. Actually the display says \"Pot: 64 chips\". Yes.\n\nI have 64 chips total, with 16 already in, so I have 48 left. To call, I need to put in 32 more, leaving me with 16 behind. If I raise, minimum raise to 80 total (I think that means total chips put in). Since I have only 64 total, I can only raise all-in to 64 total, which would be a raise of 16 more? Wait: I have 64 total, with 16 already in, so I have 48 left. If I raise all-in to 64 total, that's an additional 48. But the minimum raise to is 80, which I cannot meet because I only have 64 total. So I can only call or fold, or go all-in for 64 total, which is a raise but less than min-raise? In No-Limit, you can always go all-in even if it's less than a min-raise. So \"raise\" is a legal action, meaning I can go all-in.\n\nSo options: fold, call 32, or raise all-in to 64 total.\n\nNow, hand strength: T7s is a speculative hand. Suited connectors can be good for multi-way pots, but this is heads-up against a raiser from SB. He raised to 3x BB (48 total, BB is 16, so 3x). His range could be wide from SB. I'm getting pot odds: need to call 32 to win 64 pot (current pot 64). That's 2:1 odds, need 33% equity. Against a reasonable SB raising range, T7s might have around 30-40% equity? Let's estimate. Against top 50% of hands, T7s has about 40% equity. Against top 30%, maybe 35%. So pot odds might be borderline.\n\nBut also implied odds: if I call, I'll have 16 left behind, pot will be 96. Any flop I hit, I can get the rest in. However, stack-to-pot ratio will be low: after calling, pot 96, stack 16, SPR ~0.17, so basically committed. So if I call, I'm likely going all-in on any flop. So effectively, calling preflop is committing my stack.\n\nThus, decision is whether to fold or go all-in. Calling leaves me with a tiny stack that will be forced all-in on flop anyway, so might as well shove now to maybe get fold equity.\n\nIf I shove, he needs to call 16 more (since he has 48 total in, he'd need to call 16 to match my 64). Pot would be 64 (current) + my additional 48 = 112? Wait: If I shove for 64 total, I put in 48 more. He has put 48 total, needs to call 16 more. Pot becomes: his 48 + my 64 = 112? Actually total pot would be my 64 + his call of 64 = 128. But let's think: He raised to 48, I shove to 64, he needs to call 16 more. Pot will be his 48 + my 64 = 112, plus his call 16 = 128. So he's getting pot odds of 112:16 = 7:1, so he'll call with any two cards. So no fold equity.\n\nThus, shoving has no fold equity. So it's purely a showdown decision. So I need to compare equity of T7s vs his range.\n\nIf I call, I get to see a flop and can decide to fold if I miss, but with only 16 behind, I'll likely be forced all-in anyway. But maybe I can check-fold on flop if I completely miss? But pot will be 96, and I have 16 behind, so pot odds would be huge to call any bet. He'll likely bet small and I'll have to call. So"

So he's getting pot odds of 112:16 = 7:1, so he'll call with any two cards. So no fold equity.\n\nThus, shoving has no fold equity. So it's purely a showdown decision. So I need to compare equity of T7s vs his range.\n\nIf I call, I get to see a flop and can decide to fold if I miss, but with only 16 behind, I'll likely be forced all-in anyway. But maybe I can check-fold on flop if I completely miss? But pot will be 96, and I have 16 behind, so pot odds would be huge to call any bet. He'll likely bet small and I'll have to call. So",

          "reasoning_content": "Looking at opponent's raising patterns: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop multiple times with varying sizes: 12, 10, 24, 24, 60, 164, 24, 24, 48, 48. The recent hands (67, 68) he raised to 48. In hand 67 he had 66 (pocket sixes), in hand 68 he had AA. So his raising range includes both strong hands and medium pairs. He's aggressive.\n\nMy stack is only 4 BB. With T7s, I'm getting 2:1 pot odds. Against a typical SB stealing range, T7s has about 40% equity. That's better than the 33% needed. However, if his range is tighter due to my short stack, maybe he's raising only stronger hands. But given he's raised with 66 and AA recently, his range might be wide.\n\nGiven my stack size, I'm in push-or-fold territory. With 4 BB, I should be shoving a wide range from BB vs SB raise. T7s is borderline but probably okay to shove. Folding leaves me with 4 BB, which is still playable but desperate. Calling is bad because it commits me without initiative.\n\nIf I shove, he'll call with any two due to pot odds (he needs to call 16 to win 112, getting 7:1). So it's a pure equity race. Let's estimate equity: T7s vs random hand: ~55%. vs top 50%: ~48%. vs top 30%: ~43%. vs top 20%: ~40%. vs pairs 77+ and broadways: maybe 35%. So likely around 40-45% equity.\n\nPot if I shove: I risk 48 more (total 64). If he calls, pot is 128. My equity share: 0.4 * 128 = 51.2 chips. Minus my investment 48 = +3.2 chips expected value. If he folds (unlikely but possible if he's bluffing with total trash and doesn't want to call even with great odds), I win 64 pot immediately. But he'll almost always call.\n\nIf I fold, I have 48 left (3 BB). That's still okay for next hand.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, with 4 BB I need to double up soon. This might be a decent spot. T7s is not great but has some equity. I think shoving is reasonable.\n\nLet's check if there are any other factors: I'm in BB, he's in SB. He might be stealing wide. I have seen him raise to same size 48 in last two hands. He might be adjusting to my short stack.\n\nI think I'll go all-in.",

Ten-high with unsuited, unconnected cards. This is one of the weakest starting hands in poker.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm in the small blind, which is the worst position post-flop. I'll have to act first on every street if I continue.\n\n3. **Stack sizes:** We're all deep (100 BB effective stacks). This means implied odds are decent, but reverse implied odds are also high with such a weak hand.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies:** I have limited data on Kimi-K2. They folded preflop in hand #1. No raise history seen. This is only hand #2, so I don't have much information.\n\n5. **Pot odds:** Pot is currently 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 5 to win 9, giving me 1.8:1 pot odds (35.7% equity needed). My hand has nowhere near this equity against a typical raising range.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** Early in a tournament with deep stacks, preserving chips is important. Getting involved with Th4s from the small blind is generally a losing proposition.\n\n7. **Alternatives:** \n   - Fold: Clear choice with this hand\n   - Call: Would be terrible - out of position with a weak hand\n   - Raise: Would be even worse - bloating the pot with garbage\n\n**Decision:** This is an easy fold. Th4s is not a hand worth playing from the small blind against a raise, especially with no read on the opponent.

Both opponents in the blinds have folded their last two hands preflop. MiniMax-M2 (SB) has 197 chips, GPT-OSS-120B (BB) has 198 chips. \n\nFrom the opponent history, both have been folding preflop in the first two hands. This suggests they might be playing tight. However, 9-6 offsuit is a terrible hand to play, especially from the button. Even though I have position, the hand has very little potential. \n\nI'm facing the big blind of 2 chips. I could call to see a flop, but with such a weak hand, I'm likely to miss the flop completely or hit a weak pair that's vulnerable. Raising would be risky with this hand - I'd be putting more money in with a weak holding.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I have 100 BB, which is a healthy stack. There's no need to gamble with such a weak hand. Better to wait for better opportunities.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. That's decent, but with such a weak hand, my implied odds aren't great because even if I hit something, I might not get paid off.\n\nGiven all this, folding seems correct.

Folded hands #2 and #3 with weak holdings.\n\nFrom opponent observations:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, BB): Has folded all 3 hands preflop so far\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2): Already folded this hand\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, CO): Folded hand #2 to a raise, called SB in hand #3\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, SB): Checked hand #3 from SB\n\nI'm UTG with J3o. This is a clear fold in any competent poker strategy. J3o is in the bottom 5% of starting hands. From UTG, I should only be playing premium hands or very strong speculative hands.\n\nEven though it's only 2 chips to call (1% of my stack), calling with this hand puts me in a terrible spot post-flop. I'll be out of position with a weak hand that rarely makes strong pairs. If I hit a J, I'll have a weak kicker. If I hit a 3, it's bottom pair.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for better spots. The tournament is deep-stacked (100 BB), so no need to gamble with trash hands.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific tournament considerations: We're all around 200 chips, so stacks are fairly even. No ICM pressure or bubble considerations.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands.\n\nGiven all this:\n- Terrible hand\n- Out of position\n- Facing a raise\n- Poor pot odds\n- Deep stacks make speculative hands less attractive (implied odds are decent but hand is too weak)\n\nThis is an easy fold.

They're not overly tight.\n\nGiven that I'm on the button with position, but the hand is very weak (8T offsuit), and the raise is 4x BB which is somewhat strong, folding seems correct.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm in the big blind with 8h Jh. The opponent in seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 6 total (a 4-chip raise from 2 to 6). The pot is 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 4 more chips.\n\nFrom the opponent history, seat 1 has been folding most hands preflop (6 out of 9 hands they folded preflop). In hand 9 they checked in the BB when facing no raise. This is their first raise that I've seen. This could indicate a strong hand, or possibly they're taking advantage of their position (UTG) and the fact that several players have folded.\n\nMy hand is 8h Jh - suited but not great. J8s is a marginal hand, especially out of position. However, I'm getting good pot odds: I need to call 4 chips to win a pot of 9 chips, which is 2.25:1 odds (about 30.8% equity needed).\n\nIn tournament poker from the BB, I should defend with a wider range when getting good odds. J8s has some playability postflop with flush and straight potential, though it's not premium.\n\nMy stack is 198 chips (99 BB) - healthy. Opponent has 188 chips.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight folding history, their raise might indicate a stronger than average hand. But since it's their first raise, they could be raising with a wider range than I'd expect from their previous folding pattern.\n\nConsidering pot odds and position: I'm out of position which is a disadvantage. But the pot odds are good.\n\nI think this is a borderline decision. In tournament play with deep stacks, I could consider calling with J8s getting good odds, but being out of position against what might be a strong hand is concerning.\n\nLet me think about alternatives: Folding is safe but might be too tight given the odds. Raising is possible but with J8s out of position, that's likely not optimal unless I think I can push them off their hand. They raised from UTG, so they likely have some strength.\n\nGiven the tournament context and my stack size, I think the best play is to call and see a flop. If I hit something strong (pair with good kicker, flush draw, straight draw), I can continue. If I miss completely, I can fold to further aggression.\n\nThe pot odds justify a call with a suited connector type hand. Let's call.",

This is their first preflop raise I've seen, which suggests they might have a decent hand.\n\nMy hand analysis:\n- **8h Jh** is not great on this **Ah 9s 7s** flop\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (T would give me a straight: T-8-7-9-A? Wait, actually 8-J would need 10 for a straight, but with 7-9 on board, I need a 10 for an 8-9-T-J straight, but the board has A-9-7, so I need T for 7-8-9-T straight, but I have J-8, so T gives me 7-8-9-T-J straight)\n- Actually: Board is A-9-7, I have J-8. I need a 10 for 7-8-9-T-J straight\n- So I have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs)\n- I also have a backdoor flush draw (hearts, but board has two spades)\n- Very weak pair potential (only 8 or J would give me a pair)\n- The Ace on board likely hit the preflop raiser's range\n\nGiven that:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. My hand has very little equity (gutshot straight draw only)\n3. The opponent likely has a strong hand given their preflop raise from UTG\n4. The Ace on board is scary and likely hit their range\n5. I have position disadvantage\n\nI should check and see what the opponent does. If they bet, I'll likely fold. Checking gives me a free card to potentially hit my straight, but I should be prepared to fold to any bet.\n\nSince amount to call is 0, I should check.",

We have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs to a Ten)\n2. The board has two spades, so flush draw possible for opponent\n3. Our hand has very little showdown value currently\n4. We could try a semi-bluff bet to take down the pot\n5. Checking to see a free river card might be better\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check:** See free river card, preserve chips\n- **Bet:** Semi-bluff to represent strength, possibly win pot now\n\nGiven the opponent checked the flop after raising preflop, they might have missed the board or have a medium-strength hand. A small bet could take it down, but we're out of position.\n\nActually, let me think about the straight draw more carefully. We need a Ten. There are 4 Tens in the deck. With 46 unknown cards, we have ~8.7% chance to hit on river. Pot is 13 chips. If we bet and get called, we'd need good implied odds.\n\nGiven our weak hand and being out of position, checking seems prudent. We get a free river card and can reevaluate. If we hit our Ten, we can value bet. If we miss, we can check-fold.\n\nThe risk of betting is that we get raised and have to fold, or we build a pot we can't win without hitting.\n\nI'll check.",

Opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking in Seat 1 with 188 chips. Preflop: SB posted 1, I posted BB 2, Seat 1 raised to 6, SB folded, I called 4 more. Flop and turn were checked through.\n\nNow river: Th completes board: Ah 9s 7s 6d Th. I have 8h Jh - that's a jack-high hand with no pair. Board has Ah, Th, 9s, 7s, 6d. My Jh is second highest card but no pair. I have a gutshot straight draw that missed: I needed a Q for a straight (8-9-T-J-Q). Actually with 8h Jh on board Ah 9s 7s 6d Th, what hand do I have? Let's see: I have J high, no pair. Board has Ah, Th, 9s, 7s, 6d. I have no flush possibilities. Best possible hand is ace-high with J kicker? Actually I have J high, board has A, T, 9, 7, 6. So my hand is J high, no pair. That's terrible.\n\nBut opponent checked flop and turn. They raised preflop from UTG? Actually Seat 1 is UTG? Let's see positions: Seat 1 is first to act preflop? Actually table has 5 players: Seat 1, 2 (SB), 3 (BB me), 4, 5. So Seat 1 is UTG. They raised to 6 (3x BB). I called from BB with 8h Jh. That's a speculative call with suited one-gapper? Actually 8h Jh is suited? 8h Jh are both hearts? 8h is heart, Jh is heart? Wait 8h is heart, Jh is heart? Jh is heart? Actually Jh is heart? Card notation: 8h = 8 of hearts, Jh = Jack of hearts.

That's a straight! Yes! Board: 7s, 9s, Th, 6d, Ah. I have 8h and Jh. That gives me 6-7-8-9-T-J? Wait 6,7,8,9,T,J is a straight: 6 to J. Actually 6,7,8,9,T,J is a straight: six-high straight. Let's check: 6,7,8,9,T,J all consecutive. Yes! I have a straight! Board: 6d, 7s, 8h (my card), 9s, Th (river), Jh (my card). That's a straight! I have 6-7-8-9-T-J. That's a jack-high straight. That's a strong hand!\n\nWait need to confirm: My cards: 8h, Jh. Board: Ah, 9s, 7s, 6d, Th. So cards: 6,7,8,9,T,J. Yes that's a straight. The ace is irrelevant but doesn't interfere.

Flop and turn were checked through.\n\nNow river: Th completes board: Ah 9s 7s 6d Th. I have 8h Jh - that's a jack-high hand with no pair. Board has Ah, Th, 9s, 7s, 6d. My Jh is second highest card but no pair. I have a gutshot straight draw that missed: I needed a Q for a straight (8-9-T-J-Q). Actually with 8h Jh on board Ah 9s 7s 6d Th, what hand do I have? Let's see: I have J high, no pair. Board has Ah, Th, 9s, 7s, 6d. I have no flush possibilities. Best possible hand is ace-high with J kicker? Actually I have J high, board has A, T, 9, 7, 6.

Actually table has 5 players: Seat 1, 2 (SB), 3 (BB me), 4, 5. So Seat 1 is UTG. They raised to 6 (3x BB). I called from BB with 8h Jh. That's a speculative call with suited one-gapper? Actually 8h Jh is suited? 8h Jh are both hearts? 8h is heart, Jh is heart? Wait 8h is heart, Jh is heart? Jh is heart? Actually Jh is heart? Card notation: 8h = 8 of hearts, Jh = Jack of hearts.

          "reasoning_content": "I see Kimi-K2 Thinking has mostly folded preflop. Only hand 9 they checked and then folded on flop. This is their first raise preflop (hand 11). They raised UTG to 6 (3x). Then checked flop and turn. Their range could be medium pairs, suited connectors, broadway cards. They checked twice, likely missed flop or has medium strength. The board is draw-heavy with straight and flush possibilities. They might have missed or have a medium pair like TT, JJ, QQ, maybe AK/AQ missed.\n\nI have a straight (6-7-8-9-T-J). This is strong but vulnerable to higher straights (QJ). However, with board A-9-7-6-T, QJ makes 7-8-9-T-J-Q (7 to Q). That's possible but less likely. Also possible flush if someone has spades (board has 9s, 7s). But I have the nuts for straight unless QJ is out there.\n\nPot is 13. I can check or bet. If I bet, I might get called by worse hands: maybe A9, AT, maybe TT, JJ, or weaker pairs. Could also get called by missed draws trying to bluff catch. Or they might bluff if I check.\n\nGiven opponent's passive history (mostly folds), they might not call a bet without a strong hand. But they did raise preflop and check twice, so they might have a medium pair that's now scared of straight. A bet of 6-8 chips (half pot) might get called by Ax hands. Checking could induce a bluff if they have missed AK/AQ.\n\nBut I have a strong hand and should value bet. Small bet like 6 chips (less than half pot) could get called by Ax, pairs. If they have QJ, they might raise. But that's unlikely.\n\nI'll bet small for value. Let's raise to 6 (total bet of 6 since amount to call is 0).

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ah Qc - AQo is a strong hand, especially from the SB position. It's a premium hand but not quite AA, KK, QQ, AK.\n\n2. **Current action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 4, then Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) 3-bet to 12. I need to call 11 chips.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm in SB (worst position), which makes playing this hand more difficult postflop since I'll be out of position against both players.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - My stack: 206 chips (103 BB)\n   - Seat 1: 176 chips\n   - Seat 4 (BB yet to act): 198 chips\n   - Seat 5: 193 chips\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 19 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 4 raise + 12 3-bet). I need to call 11 to win 30, giving me pot odds of about 1:2.7 (27% equity needed). AQo against a 3-betting range likely has around 30-40% equity depending on opponent's range.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot preflop, but just raised to 6 in hand 11. This 3-bet to 12 suggests a strong hand.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been folding a lot preflop, showed 2s5s in one showdown. The initial raise to 4 could be a wider range.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (103 BB). Being in the SB with AQo facing a 3-bet is tricky. Folding preserves my stack. Calling puts me in a difficult spot postflop out of position. 4-betting could be an option but risks a lot of chips.\n\n8. **Additional factors**: The BB (Seat 4) still has to act behind me, which adds more complexity. If I call, the BB might squeeze or call as well.\n\nGiven the position disadvantage and the strength of the 3-bet (especially from an opponent who has been folding frequently), I think the prudent play is to fold. AQo doesn't play well multi-way out of position against what appears to be a strong 3-betting range. The pot odds are decent but not great given the positional disadvantage.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot with position.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm UTG (under the gun) with pocket 9s. This is a medium-strength pocket pair. At 103 BB deep, I have a healthy stack. Being UTG means I have to act first after the blinds, which is a disadvantage. Pocket 9s is borderline for opening UTG - it's playable but needs caution.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot of marginal hands, which is reasonable. The opponents seem to be AI players (Kimi-K2 Thinking, Kimi-K2, MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B). I don't have much specific history on their tendencies yet.\n\nPot odds: need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds preflop. But if I just call, I invite others to come in behind me with better hands.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (103 BB), so I can afford to be somewhat selective. Pocket 9s has good set-mining potential (hitting a 9 on the flop about 12% of the time).\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold - conservative but maybe too tight for pocket 9s\n2. Call - allows others in, could get raised behind me\n3. Raise - standard play with medium pocket pairs, builds pot for set mining, defines hand strength\n\nI think raising is best. It reduces the field, builds the pot for when I hit a set, and I can often take it down preflop if everyone folds. A standard raise would be 3-4x BB, so 6-8 chips total. Since minimum raise is to 4 (2 more), I should raise to 6 or 8.\n\nLet me check typical raise sizes. With 103 BB, raising to 8 (4x) is reasonable. That's 8 total chips, putting in 6 more.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 9s is a playable hand UTG at 103 BB.

          "reasoning_content": "Now let me think about this situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with pocket 9s. I raised to 8 (4x BB). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) 3-bet to 30 from SB. That's a significant 3-bet - they made it 30 total, which is a raise of 22 more to me (since I already put in 8).\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: They folded a lot early (hands 2-8), then started getting more active. They raised to 6 in hand 11 and to 12 in hand 12. This 3-bet to 30 is much larger than their previous raises. This suggests they might have a premium hand.\n\nPot is currently 40 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + my 8 + their 30). I need to call 22 to continue.\n\nMy stack: 198 chips, I already have 8 in, so I have 190 left. If I call, I'll have 168 left.\n\nOpponent stack: 176 chips, they have 30 in, so 146 left.\n\nThis is a tournament situation. Pocket 9s is a medium pair. Against a 3-bet from SB, their range could be wide, but given their sizing (30 total, which is 15x BB), this looks strong. They might have TT+, AK, maybe AQ.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 22 to win 40+22 = 62. That's about 35% pot odds.\n\nEquity of 99 vs a tight range (JJ+, AK): about 40%\nEquity of 99 vs wider range (TT+, AJ+, KQ): about 45%\n\nSo mathematically, calling might be okay if I think they're not super tight. But there are considerations:\n\n1. Position: I'm out of position (they're SB, I'm BB)\n2. Stack sizes: If I call, pot will be 62, and I'll have 168 left (about 2.7x pot). SPR ~2.7, which is awkward for set mining.\n3. Tournament: We're both deep (99 BB effective). Losing 22 chips here isn't devastating, but getting stacked with 99 would be.\n\nGiven the opponent's recent aggression (raising last 2 hands they played) and this large 3-bet size, I'm leaning toward folding. The 3-bet is quite large relative to previous raises (6, 12 to now 30). This feels like strength.\n\nHowever, I could consider a 4-bet bluff or call. But 99 doesn't play great out of position postflop, especially if an overcard comes.\n\nI think folding is prudent here. Let's preserve our stack and wait for better spots. We're not desperate - we have 99 BB.\n\nBut wait, I should check my own history to see if I've been aggressive.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with pocket 9s (9s 9c). My stack is 198 chips (99 BB). The pot is 40 chips. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 30 total after I raised to 8. I need to call 22 more.\n\nFrom opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has made preflop raises of 6 and 12 in previous hands (hands 11 and 12). This 30 raise is much larger. They haven't shown any calling tendencies preflop.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 9s is a medium pocket pair. Against a 3-bet from the SB, this is a tough spot. The pot odds: I need to call 22 to win 40 + 30 = 70 total pot (40 already + his 30 raise). That's 22 to win 70, or about 1:3.2, needing ~31% equity.\n\nAgainst a typical 3-betting range from SB (maybe JJ+, AK, AQ), pocket 9s has about 40-45% equity. Against a tighter range (QQ+, AK), it's about 35-40%. Against a super tight range (KK+, AA), it's about 20%.\n\nGiven the opponent's previous raises were smaller (6 and 12), this large 30 raise suggests strength. However, at 99 BB deep, I have good implied odds if I hit a set on the flop (about 7.5:1 odds to flop a set). Calling 22 with 198 stack gives me position (he's SB, I'm BB postflop).\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack. Folding preserves chips. Calling risks 22 chips (11% of stack) with potential to win more if I hit a set.\n\nThe minimum raise to is 52, which would be a 4-bet. With pocket 9s, 4-betting seems ambitious unless I think he's light. His large 3-bet suggests strength.\n\nI should consider calling to see a flop and potentially stack him if I hit a set. The pot odds are reasonable, and implied odds are good with deep stacks.\n\nHowever, I'm out of position postflop (he acts first on flop). That's a disadvantage.\n\nLet me think: If I call, pot will be 70. My stack remaining: 176. If I miss the flop and he bets, I'll likely have to fold. If I hit a set, I can potentially win his entire 176 stack.\n\nThe risk: 22 chips. The reward: potentially 176 chips. That's 8:1 implied odds, which is good for set mining (need about 7.5:1).\n\nI think calling is reasonable. Folding is also fine to preserve chips. But given the stack depths and tournament, I'll call.\n\nWait, I raised to 8 initially (from BB). He 3-bet to 30. My initial raise was small. He might be punishing my small raise with a wider range.\n\nActually, looking at the action: I raised to 8 from BB after SB posted 1 and BB posted 2. That's a 4x raise (2+8=10 total? Wait: blinds are 1/2. SB posted 1, BB posted 2. I raised to 8 total, which is 6 more than BB's 2. So it's a 3x raise over BB.\n\nHe 3-bet to 30, which is a large sizing.\n\nI'll call.",

The Q and T are both higher than my 9s. My hand is now essentially a pocket pair below the board cards.\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nSeat 1 has shown some aggression:\n- Hand 11: Raised preflop to 6, then checked flop/turn, folded river\n- Hand 12: Raised preflop to 12, bet 16 on flop\n- Hand 14: Checked preflop (as SB), bet 5 on flop\n\nThe 3-bet preflop to 30 is quite large relative to blinds (1/2). This suggests a strong range: likely QQ+, AK, maybe AQ, JJ, TT. The flop bet of 45 into 107 pot (~42% pot) is a continuation bet.\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- I have middle pair (9s) but board has Q and T\n- I need a 9 on turn or river to improve (2 outs)\n- Could also hit a straight draw if board runs out J-8 or 8-7 (unlikely)\n- Essentially I'm playing for set value, but I already missed\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 107 + 45 = 152 if I call\nI need to call 45 to win 152\nPot odds: 45/(152+45) = 45/197 \u2248 22.8%\n\n**Implied odds:**\nIf I hit my set on turn (2 outs \u2248 4.3%), I could potentially win opponent's remaining 86 chips (131 - 45 = 86)\nBut opponent might not pay off if board gets scary\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have 176 chips, opponent has 131. If I call and lose, I'll be at 131 chips. If I fold, I'm at 176 chips. This is a significant portion of my stack.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. The board hits a 3-bettor's range hard (QQ, TT, AQ, KQ all love this flop)\n2. My 9s are likely behind unless opponent has AK/JJ\n3. The bet size (45 into 107) is standard continuation, not necessarily super strong\n4. I have position for the rest of the hand\n5. I'm getting about 3.4:1 pot odds (need ~23% equity)\n\n**Equity estimate:**\nAgainst a 3-bet range of QQ+, AK, AQ, JJ, TT:\n- QQ: I'm crushed (2 outs)\n- KK/AA: I'm crushed (2 outs)  \n- AK: I'm ahead (6 outs for them)\n- AQ: I'm behind (pair of Qs, they have 5 outs)\n- JJ: I'm ahead (2 outs for them)\n- TT: I'm crushed (set)\n\nOverall, I likely have around 25-30% equity against this range. The pot odds of 23% are close. However, there's reverse implied odds - if I'm ahead, I might not get paid much, if I'm behind, I could lose more.\n\nGiven the tournament situation and that I have position but a marginal hand, I think folding is prudent. The 3-bet preflop was large, and the flop continuation suggests strength. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n**Alternative consideration:** If I think opponent is aggressive and could be bluffing with AK, maybe I could call. But with my stack size, it's risky.\n\nI'll fold."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand:**\n- My position: BB (Seat 3)\n- My cards: 9\u2660 9\u2663\n- My stack: 176 chips (88 BB)\n- Pot: 107 chips\n- Board: T\u2665 3\u2660 Q\u2663\n- Opponent: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) with 131 chips\n- Action: Opponent bet 45, I need to call 45\n\n**Preflop action recap:**\n- I raised to 8 from BB (standard raise with pocket 9s)\n- Seat 1 (SB) 3-bet to 30 (significant raise)\n- I called the additional 22 (pot was getting sizable)\n\n**Flop analysis:**\nBoard: T\u2665 3\u2660 Q\u2663\nThis is a somewhat wet board with two overcards to my 9s. The Q and T are both higher than my 9s. My hand is now essentially a pocket pair below the board cards.\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nSeat 1 has shown some aggression:\n- Hand 11: Raised preflop to 6, then checked flop/turn, folded river\n- Hand 12: Raised preflop to 12, bet 16 on flop\n- Hand 14: Checked preflop (as SB), bet 5 on flop\n\nThe 3-bet preflop to 30 is quite large relative to blinds (1/2). This suggests a strong range: likely QQ+, AK, maybe AQ, JJ, TT. The flop bet of 45 into 107 pot (~42% pot) is a continuation bet.\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- I have middle pair (9s) but board has Q and T\n- I need a 9 on turn or river to improve (2 outs)\n- Could also hit a straight draw if board runs out J-8 or 8-7 (unlikely)\n- Essentially I'm playing for set value, but I already missed\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 107 + 45 = 152 if I call\nI need to call 45 to win 152\nPot odds: 45/(152+45) = 45/197 \u2248 22.8%\n\n**Implied odds:**\nIf I hit my set on turn (2 outs \u2248 4.3%), I could potentially win opponent's remaining 86 chips (131 - 45 = 86)\nBut opponent might not pay off if board gets scary\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have 176 chips, opponent has 131. If I call and lose, I'll be at 131 chips. If I fold, I'm at 176 chips. This is a significant portion of my stack.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. The board hits a 3-bettor's range hard (QQ, TT, AQ, KQ all love this flop)\n2. My 9s are likely behind unless opponent has AK/JJ\n3. The bet size (45 into 107) is standard continuation, not necessarily super strong\n4. I have position for the rest of the hand\n5. I'm getting about 3.4:1 pot odds (need ~23% equity)\n\n**Equity estimate:**\nAgainst a 3-bet range of QQ+, AK, AQ, JJ, TT:\n- QQ: I'm crushed (2 outs)\n- KK/AA: I'm crushed (2 outs)  \n- AK: I'm ahead (6 outs for them)\n- AQ: I'm behind (pair of Qs, they have 5 outs)\n- JJ: I'm ahead (2 outs for them)\n- TT: I'm crushed (set)\n\nOverall, I likely have around 25-30% equity against this range. The pot odds of 23% are close. However, there's reverse implied odds - if I'm ahead, I might not get paid much, if I'm behind, I could lose more.\n\nGiven the tournament situation and that I have position but a marginal hand, I think folding is prudent. The 3-bet preflop was large, and the flop continuation suggests strength. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n**Alternative consideration:** If I think opponent is aggressive and could be bluffing with AK, maybe I could call. But with my stack size, it's risky.\n\nI'll fold.",

The current raise to 6 (3x BB) is relatively small compared to their 15x BB raise in hand #15.\n\n**My Situation:**\n- J9o is a weak hand, especially from out of position\n- I'm getting 9:4 pot odds (2.25:1) to call\n- If I call, the pot will be 13 chips, and I'll have position disadvantage\n- My stack is healthy (87 BB), so I don't need to take marginal spots\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a decent stack, no need to gamble with weak hands\n- Defending BB with J9o against a single raise is marginal at best\n- Against an aggressive opponent, I could consider 3-betting as a bluff, but J9o is too weak for that\n- Folding preserves my stack for better spots\n\n**Decision:**\nJ9o is not a good hand to defend from the BB against a raise. While the pot odds are reasonable (2.25:1), I need around 30% equity to call. J9o vs a typical UTG raising range has maybe 35-40% equity, but that's close. More importantly, I'll be out of position postflop, which reduces my equity realization significantly. Against an aggressive opponent who might barrel multiple streets, this becomes a difficult spot.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better hand in position.",

The Ace gives us some high card value, but 3 is a weak kicker. Being suited adds some flush potential.\n\n**Position considerations:**\nWe're out of position (SB) against a raiser who likely has position on us (Seat 2 is likely UTG or UTG+1 based on the action). Being out of position with a marginal hand is difficult.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nWe need to call 5 to win 14 (9 current pot + our 5 call). That's 5:14 or about 1:2.8, meaning we need ~26% equity. Against a typical raising range, A3s likely has around 30-35% equity, so pot odds are favorable.\n\n**Stack preservation:**\nWe have 86.5 BB, which is healthy. Calling 5 chips (2.5 BB) is a small investment.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nWe want to preserve chips but also accumulate. A3s can flop well (flush draws, ace-high, straight draws).\n\n**Decision:**\nCalling seems reasonable. Folding is also fine given the positional disadvantage. Raising would be aggressive with a marginal hand out of position.\n\nGiven the pot odds and the fact that we have a suited Ace with some potential, I'll call. This allows us to see a flop and potentially hit something strong without committing too many chips.\n\nHowever, I should consider that the opponent has been raising somewhat frequently (40%), which might indicate a wider range. This makes calling more attractive.\n\nI'll call.",

They seem to raise with decent hands but not extremely tight. They folded to 3-bets in some hands.\n\n**Hand strength evaluation:**\n- My A3s has missed the flop completely\n- I have Ace-high, which might be good if opponent has missed\n- I have backdoor flush draw (clubs) and backdoor straight potential\n- Paired board means opponent could have trips or full house\n\n**Pot odds and decision:**\n- Pot is 14 chips, no bet to call\n- I can check, raise, or fold\n- Checking seems standard with Ace-high on this board\n- Raising could be a bluff if I think opponent will fold\n- Folding seems too weak given I have position and some backdoor equity\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 84 BB, healthy stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks\n- But also need to accumulate chips\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check and see what opponent does. My hand has some showdown value if opponent checks behind, and I have backdoor draws. Raising here with Ace-high on a paired board seems too aggressive and could get me into trouble if opponent has a Jack or better. Checking allows me to realize equity cheaply.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking with Ace-high on paired board. Have backdoor flush and straight draws.

They seem to be playing a typical TAG style - raising with decent hands, folding weak ones. No postflop data available as they've mostly folded preflop or we don't have showdown info.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have ace-high with a weak kicker on a double paired board\n- The board is Jd 8d Jc 8c - very dry except for diamond draws\n- My hand has no flush draw (clubs and diamonds on board, I have Ac and 3c)\n- My only real chance is to bluff or catch an ace on river\n- The double paired board makes it less likely opponent has a strong hand unless they have Jx or 8x\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1. I'm out of position (BB vs UTG+1 raiser)\n2. Pot is small (14 chips)\n3. Opponent checked back flop, suggesting weakness or a draw\n4. On a double paired board, many hands missed\n5. My ace-high might be the best hand given opponent's flop check\n6. I could try a small bet to take it down now\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: See a free river, but gives opponent chance to bluff or improve\n- **Bet**: Try to take down pot now with a small bet (4-6 chips)\n\nGiven the small pot and my positional disadvantage, I think a small bet is reasonable. If opponent has a weak hand like 99-TT or a missed draw, they might fold. If they call or raise, I can easily give up on river.\n\nI'll bet small - 4 chips (minimum raise) to keep pressure while risking minimal chips."

They seem to be playing a typical TAG style - raising with decent hands, folding weak ones. No postflop data available as they've mostly folded preflop or we don't have showdown info.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have ace-high with a weak kicker on a double paired board\n- The board is Jd 8d Jc 8c - very dry except for diamond draws\n- My hand has no flush draw (clubs and diamonds on board, I have Ac and 3c)\n- My only real chance is to bluff or catch an ace on river\n- The double paired board makes it less likely opponent has a strong hand unless they have Jx or 8x\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n1. I'm out of position (BB vs UTG+1 raiser)\n2. Pot is small (14 chips)\n3. Opponent checked back flop, suggesting weakness or a draw\n4. On a double paired board, many hands missed\n5. My ace-high might be the best hand given opponent's flop check\n6. I could try a small bet to take it down now\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: See a free river, but gives opponent chance to bluff or improve\n- **Bet**: Try to take down pot now with a small bet (4-6 chips)\n\nGiven the small pot and my positional disadvantage, I think a small bet is reasonable.

Minimum raise is to 4 total (2 more). However, with suited connectors, I often prefer to see a cheap flop and play postflop.\n\nConsidering tournament: I have 91 BB, not desperate. 87s is marginal but playable from button. The blinds are tight, so they might fold to a raise. But if they call, I'm out of position postflop (except against BB if SB folds).\n\nBetter to call and see a flop.

Seems tight.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has folded 8 of 10 preflop actions, raised once (hand 12), but generally tight.\n\nBoth blinds appear to be playing tight, folding most hands. From the button, 87s has good implied odds if I hit a strong draw or hand. I have 91 BB stack, which is healthy.\n\nThe pot is 3 chips (SB+BB). I need to call 2 chips to see a flop. That's 1 BB. Pot odds: 3:2 or 1.5:1, which is decent for speculative hand.\n\nGiven my position and opponent tendencies, I could consider a small raise to try to take the pot down preflop or build a pot with initiative. Minimum raise is to 4 total (2 more). However, with suited connectors, I often prefer to see a cheap flop and play postflop.\n\nConsidering tournament: I have 91 BB, not desperate. 87s is marginal but playable from button. The blinds are tight, so they might fold to a raise. But if they call, I'm out of position postflop (except against BB if SB folds).\n\nBetter to call and see a flop. If I hit a draw or pair, I can continue. If not, I can fold. The cost is minimal (2 chips = 1 BB).\n\nLet's call.",

On this flop of 5s Kh 6s, I have:\n- Open-ended straight draw (4 or 9 gives me a straight)\n- Backdoor flush draw (two diamonds)\n- No pair\n- Weak hand currently but good drawing potential\n\nThe board is somewhat coordinated with two spades (flush draw possible), and K high. My opponent checked. Looking at opponent history, GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop (folded last 4 hands preflop, and several before that). They raised once in hand 12 preflop but then folded on the flop.\n\nGiven the small pot (5 chips) and my position, I have several options:\n1. Check back: Take a free card with my draw\n2. Bet: Try to take the pot down now with a semi-bluff, or build the pot if I hit\n\nWith my open-ended straight draw (8 outs), backdoor flush draw (~1.5 outs), and position, I have decent equity. A bet could get folds from weak hands, especially since the flop has a King which might have missed many hands.\n\nHowever, the pot is small, and I'm not in a rush to build a big pot with a draw. Checking back gives me a free card and keeps the pot small, which might be good since I'm not strong yet.\n\nBut considering tournament dynamics and stack sizes (I have 180 chips, opponent has 180 chips), a small bet could be good. If I bet 2-3 chips (40-60% pot), I can apply pressure and potentially win the pot now.\n\nLooking at my history, I recently won a hand with a turn bet after checking flop. But here I have position and a draw.\n\nI think a small bet is reasonable as a semi-bluff. Let's bet 3 chips (60% pot). This puts pressure on opponent and builds the pot if I hit. If called, I still have good equity.\n\nActually, wait - I should check the opponent's tendencies more. They folded on the flop in hand 12 when facing action. They might be tight. A bet could take it down.\n\nI'll go with a small raise."

On this flop of 5s Kh 6s, I have:\n- Open-ended straight draw (4 or 9 gives me a straight)\n- Backdoor flush draw (two diamonds)\n- No pair\n- Weak hand currently but good drawing potential\n\nThe board is somewhat coordinated with two spades (flush draw possible), and K high. My opponent checked. Looking at opponent history, GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop (folded last 4 hands preflop, and several before that). They raised once in hand 12 preflop but then folded on the flop.\n\nGiven the small pot (5 chips) and my position, I have several options:\n1. Check back: Take a free card with my draw\n2. Bet: Try to take the pot down now with a semi-bluff, or build the pot if I hit\n\nWith my open-ended straight draw (8 outs), backdoor flush draw (~1.5 outs), and position, I have decent equity. A bet could get folds from weak hands, especially since the flop has a King which might have missed many hands.\n\nHowever, the pot is small, and I'm not in a rush to build a big pot with a draw. Checking back gives me a free card and keeps the pot small, which might be good since I'm not strong yet.\n\nBut considering tournament dynamics and stack sizes (I have 180 chips, opponent has 180 chips), a small bet could be good. If I bet 2-3 chips (40-60% pot), I can apply pressure and potentially win the pot now.\n\nLooking at my history, I recently won a hand with a turn bet after checking flop. But here I have position and a draw.\n\nI think a small bet is reasonable as a semi-bluff. Let's bet 3 chips (60% pot). This puts pressure on opponent and builds the pot if I hit. If called, I still have good equity.\n\nActually, wait - I should check the opponent's tendencies more. They folded on the flop in hand 12 when facing action. They might be tight. A bet could take it down.\n\nI'll go with a small raise.",

Bet: Semi-bluff, could win pot now, build pot if hit\n\nGiven opponent folded on flop previously when facing action, and seems tight, a small bet might win the pot. But the pot is small, so risk/reward: betting 3 chips to win 5 chips. If I get called, I have good equity (around 32% for straight draw plus some backdoor flush).\n\nBut actually, I should consider tournament stack sizes. We both have 180 chips (90 BB). That's deep enough. A bet of 3 chips is trivial relative to stacks.\n\nI think betting is good. It's a semi-bluff with good equity, and I have position. If called, I can reevaluate on turn.\n\nI'll bet 3 chips (raise_to: 3 since amount to call is 0). Wait, \"raise_to\" should be total amount? Actually, I'm not raising since no bet to call.

The pot is offering me 10:0 odds to check (since amount to call is 0).\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown some aggression (raises preflop in hands 15 and 16, bet on flop in hand 14 and 15). However, in this hand they just limped (called) from UTG. This could indicate a weaker hand. They've folded preflop in several recent hands (17, 18, 19).\n\n**Position**: I'm out of position (BB vs UTG). This is a disadvantage postflop.\n\n**Stack sizes**: I have 181 chips, opponent has 237 chips. Both are deep stacked (45+ BB).\n\n**Tournament considerations**: At 45 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands.\n\n**Decision**: With A2o out of position against a limper, the standard play is to check and see a flop. Raising would be aggressive but could isolate a weak limper. However, A2o doesn't play well postflop, especially out of position. Checking is the most reasonable play.\n\nChecking allows me to see a flop cheaply. If I hit an Ace, I can proceed cautiously. If I miss completely, I can fold. The pot odds are excellent (free to check).\n\nI should check and see the flop."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\nHand: As 2d\nBoard: 8h 3c 5c 6c\n\nI have Ace-high with a gutshot straight draw (need a 4 for a straight: 2-3-4-5-6). I also have a backdoor flush draw with the Ac (though only one club in my hand). The board is 8h 3c 5c 6c - three clubs on board, so there's a flush possibility.\n\nI'm in the BB with 181 chips (45.2 BB). The pot is 10 chips. It's the turn, and the action is on me. Amount to call is 0.\n\nLooking at opponent actions: Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) is the only opponent left in the hand. From the recall, they seem to be an active player - they've raised preflop several times, bet on flops, and in hand #20 they bet 4 on the turn. They checked the flop this hand though.\n\nMy hand has some potential: \n- Gutshot straight draw (4 outs)\n- Ace overcard (3 outs if opponent doesn't have an Ace)\n- Backdoor flush potential (though weak with only Ac)\n\nHowever, the board is coordinated with three clubs, so there's flush danger. My opponent checked the flop, which could mean they have a weak hand or are slow-playing something strong.\n\nGiven the small pot (10 chips) and my marginal hand, I think the best play is to check and see a free river. If I hit my straight or an Ace, I can consider betting. If not, I can fold to any bet.\n\nI have position (BB acting first on turn), but the opponent checked flop, so they might check again on turn.\n\nLet me check: Board is 8h 3c 5c 6c. The straight draw is to 7 (for 4-5-6-7-8) or 4 (for 2-3-4-5-6). Actually, I have 2-3-5-6-8 on board with my A2. I need a 4 for a straight: 2-3-4-5-6. That's 4 outs. The 7 would give me 5-6-7-8 with my A2, not a straight. So yes, 4 outs to a straight.\n\nGiven the small pot and marginal draw, checking seems correct. I'll check to see a free river.",

The board is 8h 3c 5c 6c Kc. This is a four-club board with a straight possibility (4-5-6-7-8, though 7 would complete it). My hand has:\n- Ace-high only\n- No pair\n- No flush (I have As 2d, no club)\n- No straight (I need a 4 or 7 for straight)\n- Basically just Ace-high with no draw\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall, Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown:\n- Aggressive tendencies with raises preflop and bets on flop\n- In hand #20, they bet 4 on the turn\n- They limped preflop this hand (just called from UTG)\n- They checked flop and turn\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe river brought Kc, making four clubs on board. This is a scary card that completes many draws:\n- Flush draws got there\n- Straight draws with 7c would have flush too\n- Kc pairs the king\n\n**Pot Analysis:**\nPot is only 10 chips. Very small pot relative to stacks.\n\n**My Position:**\nI'm in BB, checked through flop and turn. Opponent checked behind both streets. This suggests neither of us has a strong hand.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the board texture and my weak hand (just Ace-high), I should check and hope to win at showdown. The Kc on river likely didn't help my opponent either since they checked turn. They might have a weak hand too. If I bet, I risk being raised or called by a better hand. With just 10 chips in the pot, not worth bluffing.\n\nThe opponent has shown aggression in other hands but checked this one twice. They likely have a weak hand as well. Ace-high might be good here.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I have 45 BB, healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks for 10 chips.\n\nI'll check and hope my Ace-high wins."

I'm facing just the blinds - SB (Seat 4) and BB (Seat 5). I need to call 4 chips to see the flop, or I can raise.\n\nMy stack is 189 chips (47.2 BB), which is healthy. The BB (Seat 5) has shown some aggression preflop - I can see from the recall that they've raised in 3 hands. They seem to be somewhat active.\n\nA8o is a marginal hand from the button. It's not great, but it has some value in position against blinds. The ace gives me some high card strength, but the 8 is a weak kicker.\n\nGiven my position (button) and that both players have folded to me, this is a good spot to either raise or call. Raising would be standard to apply pressure on the blinds. However, I should consider:\n\n1. A8o plays better as a raise than a call - I can win the pot preflop or play in position with initiative.\n2. The BB has shown aggression, so they might defend more often.\n3. My stack is healthy, so I can afford to play this hand.\n\nLooking at the recall data: Seat 5 (BB) has raised preflop 3 times, which suggests they might be somewhat aggressive. But they're in the BB now, so they already have money in the pot and might defend.\n\nI think a small raise is appropriate here. I'll raise to 8 chips total (which is a min-raise from 4 to 8). This gives me positional advantage and allows me to potentially win the pot preflop.\n\nLet me calculate: If I raise to 8, that's putting in 4 more chips. The pot would be 14 (6 current + 8 from me). The blinds would need to call 4 (SB) and 0 (BB) more respectively.\n\nActually wait, the BB already has 4 in, so they'd need to call 4 more. The SB has 2 in, so they'd need to call 6 more.\n\nA min-raise should be fine here. Let me check if there are any other considerations... My win rate is 27% from 22 hands, which is reasonable. I've won a couple hands recently.\n\nI think raising is better than calling because:\n1. I have position\n2. A8o benefits from initiative\n3. I can potentially win preflop\n4. If called, I have position postflop\n\nI'll go with a min-raise.",

The board is low and dry, my preflop raise represents strength, and opponent has shown tendency to fold on flop. A small bet of 8-10 chips (less than half pot) should take it down often.\n\nLet me check the minimum raise: it says minimum raise to 4, but that's confusing because amount to call is 0. Actually, I think I can bet any amount from 4 up to my stack. I'll bet 8 chips (raise_to would be 8 total, but since amount to call is 0, I think \"raise\" means bet here). Wait, actually \"raise_to\" is total amount in pot. Since nothing to call, if I bet 8, raise_to should be 8.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Standard continuation bet on dry low board with position.

From UTG (under the gun, first to act), this is an easy fold in most poker strategies. The hand has very little potential to make strong hands postflop. Even if I hit a pair, it's a weak pair with Ten kicker.\n\nLooking at the table dynamics: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) folded, so I'm the first to act preflop. There are still 3 players behind me who haven't acted: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2), Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B), and Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) in the big blind. \n\nFrom the opponent data, I see that in hand #22, Kimi-K2 raised to 8 from what appears to be UTG+1 position, showing some aggression. In hand #23, GPT-OSS-120B called from the small blind and then folded on the flop. I don't have much data on opponents' tendencies yet, but that's okay.\n\nMy stack is 199 chips (49.8 BB), which is healthy. I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots. Playing Th3o from UTG would likely put me in difficult spots postflop, especially with multiple players left to act who could raise behind me.\n\nThe amount to call is 4 chips (the big blind), but calling with this hand would be poor. I'd be out of position for the rest of the hand with a weak holding. Raising would be even worse - I'd be building a pot with a terrible hand.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and stack preservation considerations, the clear decision is to fold. I'll wait for a better hand in a better position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Th3o is extremely weak from UTG position.

I need to call 4 chips to see the flop from UTG.\n\nLet me think about the position: UTG is the worst position to play from, especially with a weak hand. There are 4 players left to act after me (MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB). \n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been playing fairly passively (checking/calling)\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised once in hand 22 but otherwise folded preflop\n\nMy own hand history shows I've been folding weak hands from early positions, which is correct.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6 chips (after my call, pot would be 10). That's 1:1.5 odds, or 40% pot odds.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with Jh7s, facing a raise to 14 from UTG (Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking). The pot is 20 (4 from BB, 2 from SB, 14 from UTG), and I need to call 10 more.\n\nLet me think about this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Jh7s is a weak hand. Offsuit, not connected, not suited. This is a clear folding hand against a raise from UTG.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position (BB vs UTG), which makes playing this hand even worse.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the search results, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising preflop in various positions. In hand #16, they raised to 6 from UTG. In hand #12, they raised to 12. In hand #15, they raised to 30. So they have an aggressive raising range. Their current raise to 14 (3.5x BB) is a standard raise size.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 195 chips (48.8 BB). Calling 10 chips would be 5.1% of my stack. While not huge, I'm playing a weak hand out of position.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 20, need to call 10, so getting 2:1 odds. However, with such a weak hand, I need much better implied odds to continue, and I'm out of position.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (48.8 BB). No need to gamble with marginal hands.\n\n7. **Alternatives**: I could consider a 3-bet bluff, but Jh7s is too weak for that, especially against an UTG raise. Folding is the standard play.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been playing reasonably tight. In hand #16, I folded J9s from BB to a UTG raise of 6. Jh7s is even weaker than J9s.\n\nThe opponent has shown they can raise with various hands, but even against a wide range, Jh7s doesn't play well postflop, especially out of position.\n\n**Decision**: Fold.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My hand: Ah 6d (ace-six offsuit)\n- My position: SB (small blind)\n- My stack: 193 chips (48.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 18 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise)\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 in seat 2 raised to 12 total\n- Amount to call: 10 (since I already posted 2 as SB)\n- Minimum raise to: 20 total\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nA6o is a marginal hand, especially from the SB facing a raise. The ace is good, but the 6 kicker is weak. This hand plays better as a call in position rather than out of position.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the recall data, Kimi-K2 has:\n- Mostly folded preflop (7 out of 10 actions were folds)\n- One raise action in hand #22 (raised to 8)\n- No showdowns recorded\nThis suggests Kimi-K2 is playing tight, so their raising range is likely strong.\n\n**Position consideration:**\nI'm in the SB, which is the worst position postflop. I'll have to act first on every street, making it difficult to realize equity and control the pot.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 18 chips\n- To call: 10 chips\n- Pot odds: 10/(18+10) = 10/28 \u2248 35.7%\nI need ~36% equity to call. Against a tight raising range from a tight player, A6o likely has less than 36% equity.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- My stack: 193 chips (48.2 BB)\n- Opponent stack: 186 chips (46.5 BB)\n- If I call, pot will be 28 chips preflop, which is ~15% of my stack. This commits me somewhat but not completely.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have an average stack (48 BB). There's no need to take marginal spots out of position against a tight player.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n1. Fold - Preserve chips, avoid playing marginal hand OOP\n2. Call - See flop with ace-high, but likely dominated\n3. Raise - Could 3-bet bluff, but A6o is not a good candidate and we have no fold equity read\n\nGiven Kimi-K2's tight tendencies and my poor position, folding is the correct play. A6o doesn't have enough equity against a tight raising range, and playing OOP with a weak ace is a recipe for losing chips.\n\nI should wait for better spots in better position.",

This is a very weak hand from early position. K4o has poor playability postflop - if I hit a king, I'm often dominated by better kickers. The 4 is a terrible kicker. The hand is offsuit, so no flush potential.\n\nMy stack is 199 chips (49.8 BB), which is healthy. Blinds are 2/4. I need to call 4 chips to see the flop. Pot is currently 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4). After my call, pot would be 10 chips.\n\nHowever, I'm UTG with 3 players left to act: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4), GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, SB), and Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, BB). Given that MiniMax-M2 has been folding every hand, they might fold again. But GPT-OSS-120B in SB and Kimi-K2 Thinking in BB could raise, putting me in a difficult spot.\n\nEven if I just call and see the flop, with K4o I'll often be in tricky situations postflop. The hand has very little potential to make strong hands. Best case is hitting two pair or trips, but that's unlikely.\n\nTournament strategy: With 50 BB, I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots. Playing K4o from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\nPot odds: 4 to win 10 (2.5:1) but with such a weak hand and bad position, the implied odds are poor.\n\nGiven all this, folding is clearly the best decision. I'll respond with the JSON format.",

I'm in the big blind (I posted 4). So I need to call 4 more to stay in the pot (total 8). The pot is currently: SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 8 + call 8 = 22 chips. I need to call 4 to win 22, giving me 5.5:1 pot odds.\n\nMy hand J9o is marginal, especially from the BB facing a raise and a call. However, I'm on the button, which gives me positional advantage postflop. With 5.5:1 odds, I can call with many hands. But I should consider opponent tendencies.\n\nFrom the data: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has no recorded raises in my limited data, but that's just small sample. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has called preflop multiple times with weak hands like 2s5s, 6c7d, 8d7s. So seat 5 is a loose caller. Seat 4's raise could be a wide range given seat 5 is loose.\n\nMy stack is 195 chips (48.8 BB). Calling 4 chips is only 2% of my stack. However, I'm out of position for the rest of the hand (actually wait: I'm on the button, but I'm in the BB this hand? Let me check: \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\" but \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 4\". So I'm the button but posting BB because button rotates. So I'm out of position for this hand (BB). That's worse.\n\nGiven I'm out of position with J9o, facing a raise and a call, I should probably fold. The pot odds are good but positional disadvantage is significant. Also J9o doesn't play well multi-way out of position. I could consider raising to isolate, but with a marginal hand and out of position, that's risky.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for better spots.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this hand. I'm on the button with 3c 2d, which is an absolutely terrible hand - one of the worst possible starting hands. The opponent in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 12 chips (3x BB). Looking at the opponent's history, I can see:\n\n1. In the last 4 hands (26-29), GPT-OSS-120B folded preflop every time.\n2. In hand 30, they raised to 12 preflop, then checked on flop, turn, and river.\n3. In hand 31, they called 8 preflop, then folded on the flop.\n\nSo they've shown some aggression in hand 30 with a raise, but then checked down the whole hand. This could indicate they had a speculative hand or were trying to steal. They have 142 chips (35.5 BB), which is a medium stack.\n\nMy stack is 193 chips (48.2 BB), so I have a decent stack. The pot is 18 chips, and I need to call 10 chips to continue. That's about 5.5% of my stack.\n\nHowever, with 32o, this is an easy fold. The hand has almost no playability postflop - it's not suited, not connected, and has very low cards. Even if I hit a pair, it's a weak bottom pair that's vulnerable. The only reasonable flop would be something like 2-3-5 for a straight draw, but even then it's a gutshot.\n\nPositionally, being on the button is good, but with such a terrible hand, I shouldn't be playing it. The raiser is in early position (seat 5 is UTG?), actually looking at the table: Seat 5 is UTG? Let me check the positions: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded, I'm Seat 3 (BTN), Seat 4 is BB, Seat 5 is UTG? Actually with 5 players, positions would be: SB (Seat 3? Wait I'm BTN), BB (Seat 4), UTG (Seat 5), MP (Seat 1), CO (Seat 2). So the raiser is UTG, which makes their range stronger.\n\nUTG raising range should be fairly tight. With 32o, I'm dominated by almost any hand they could have. Even if they're bluffing, I have no way to know and my hand can't stand much pressure postflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 10 to win 28 (18 current pot + 10 my call). That's about 35.7% equity needed. 32o has about 32% equity against a random hand, but against a UTG raising range, it's much worse. Against a tight range like 22+, A2s+, A7o+, K9s+, KTo+, QTs+, QJo, JTs, my equity is only about 24%.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack and should preserve it. No need to gamble with trash hands.\n\nThe BB (Seat 4) still has to act after me, so there's additional risk of a squeeze.\n\nEasy fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 2s4s, which is a very weak hand - 2-4 suited. However, I'm in late position (button) with only the blinds left to act. Looking at opponent tendencies:\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has mostly folded preflop (7 out of 10 times), but raised once in hand 31 and bet the flop. Shows some aggression occasionally.\n\nSeat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised twice preflop (hands 30 and 32), called once (hand 31), and folded several times. Shows more aggression than seat 4.\n\nMy stack is 193 chips (48.2 BB), which is healthy. The blinds are 2/4, so I need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\nWith 2-4 suited, this is a speculative hand that can make flushes and straights, but it's very weak preflop. Being on the button against only the blinds, this could be a good spot to steal or see a cheap flop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6 (pot is 6), so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds, which is decent. However, the hand is so weak that I'm likely dominated by any pair or better cards.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack (48 BB), so I don't need to take big risks. However, being on the button is a great position to apply pressure.\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies - both blinds have shown they can fold preflop (especially seat 4 who folds a lot), I could consider a raise to try to steal the blinds. But with 2-4 suited, that's risky because if called, I'm likely way behind.\n\nBetter to either fold or call for cheap. Folding is the safe play. Calling for 4 chips (2% of my stack) to see a flop in position isn't terrible, but the hand is so weak that even if I hit a pair, it's bottom pair.\n\nI think folding is the correct play here. Save my chips for better spots. Let me check if there are any other factors... I have position, but the hand is just too weak to play.\n\nActually, wait - I should consider that both opponents have shown some aggression, so they might defend their blinds more. Seat 5 raised last hand (hand 32) from the BB when it folded to him. So he might be defending.\n\nI'll fold.",

My stack is 193 chips (48.2 BB), which is healthy but not huge.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has raised preflop multiple times (hand 11: 6, hand 12: 12, hand 15: 30, hand 16: 6, hand 26: 14). Seems active and aggressive.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Only 1 recorded raise preflop (hand 31: 8).\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop frequently (6 times), often with small raises (4 chips) and sometimes larger (12 chips). Shows some aggression.\n\nI'm in UTG position, which is early position. With pocket tens, I should raise to build the pot and narrow the field. Since I have 48 BB, a standard raise would be 3-4x BB, so 12-16 chips. The minimum raise is to 8 chips (just 2x BB), but that's too small.\n\nI should consider raising to around 12-14 chips (3-3.5x BB). This is a reasonable size from UTG with a medium pocket pair. It will likely get folds from weaker hands and potentially get calls from speculative hands, which is fine since I have position on the blinds.\n\nIf I just call, I let too many players in cheaply, and my hand becomes more vulnerable to overcards. Raising is definitely the right play.\n\nLet me check if there are any particular patterns from opponents when facing raises from UTG. Let me search for \"UTG raise\" or similar."

My stack is 193 chips (48.2 BB), which is healthy but not huge.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has raised preflop multiple times (hand 11: 6, hand 12: 12, hand 15: 30, hand 16: 6, hand 26: 14). Seems active and aggressive.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Only 1 recorded raise preflop (hand 31: 8).\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop frequently (6 times), often with small raises (4 chips) and sometimes larger (12 chips). Shows some aggression.\n\nI'm in UTG position, which is early position. With pocket tens, I should raise to build the pot and narrow the field. Since I have 48 BB, a standard raise would be 3-4x BB, so 12-16 chips. The minimum raise is to 8 chips (just 2x BB), but that's too small.\n\nI should consider raising to around 12-14 chips (3-3.5x BB). This is a reasonable size from UTG with a medium pocket pair. It will likely get folds from weaker hands and potentially get calls from speculative hands, which is fine since I have position on the blinds.\n\nIf I just call, I let too many players in cheaply, and my hand becomes more vulnerable to overcards. Raising is definitely the right play.\n\nLet me check if there are any particular patterns from opponents when facing raises from UTG. Let me search for \"UTG raise\" or similar.",

It has virtually no playability, especially from UTG.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position to play marginal hands from, as I have to act first post-flop with 4 players left to act behind me.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 199 chips (49.8 BB) is healthy, but not so deep that I can afford to play speculative hands from bad position.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (7 of last 8 hands folded preflop)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Also folding frequently, but did call once with T6s\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression with raises and bets post-flop\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop multiple times, seems active\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack, I should preserve it for better spots. Playing 84o from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I'd need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. However, with such a weak hand, I'm unlikely to win unless I hit a miracle flop, and even then I could be dominated.\n\nGiven all this analysis, this is an easy fold. I should wait for a better spot with position or a stronger hand.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been playing too tight or loose."

Let me think through this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 4h 8s is one of the worst possible starting hands in poker. It's offsuit, low cards, no connectivity. It has virtually no playability, especially from UTG.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position to play marginal hands from, as I have to act first post-flop with 4 players left to act behind me.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 199 chips (49.8 BB) is healthy, but not so deep that I can afford to play speculative hands from bad position.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (7 of last 8 hands folded preflop)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Also folding frequently, but did call once with T6s\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression with raises and bets post-flop\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop multiple times, seems active\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack, I should preserve it for better spots. Playing 84o from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I'd need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. However, with such a weak hand, I'm unlikely to win unless I hit a miracle flop, and even then I could be dominated.\n\nGiven all this analysis, this is an easy fold. I should wait for a better spot with position or a stronger hand.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been playing too tight or loose.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with 22. The SB folded, and UTG (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) just limped in (called the BB). The pot is 10 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 4 limp). I have 195 chips (48.8 BB). My options are fold, check, or raise.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has folded 9 out of 10 recent actions, with only one raise in hand #26 preflop. They seem fairly tight/passive. They just limped UTG, which suggests a weak to medium hand.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 2s is a small pocket pair. In heads-up situation from BB vs UTG limper, this is a decent spot. Small pocket pairs have good implied odds if we hit a set (about 1 in 8.5 chance). However, we're out of position which is a disadvantage.\n\nStack sizes: I have 195 chips (48.8 BB), opponent has 233 chips (58.3 BB). Pot is 10 chips.\n\nIf I check, I see a flop for free. If I raise, I can try to take the pot down preflop or build a bigger pot for when I hit a set. A standard raise would be to 12-16 chips (3-4x BB).\n\nGiven the opponent's tight tendencies (lots of folds), a raise might get them to fold, winning the 10-chip pot immediately. Even if they call, I have position disadvantage but decent implied odds if I hit a set.\n\nHowever, raising with 22 out of position against a limper can be tricky. If I get called, I'll be playing a small pair out of position on most flops that don't contain a 2.\n\nLet me consider tournament dynamics: I have 48.8 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take big risks. The pot is only 10 chips.\n\nActually, checking seems reasonable here. I get to see a flop for free with a hand that needs to improve. If I hit a set on the flop, I can potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold to any aggression.\n\nRaising might be better if I think the opponent will fold often, but given they limped UTG (showing some interest), they might call with a wide range.\n\nLet me check: I'm getting infinite pot odds to check (0 to call). If I raise to say 12, I'm risking 8 more chips to win 10, needing fold equity > 44% for immediate profit. With opponent's fold-heavy tendencies, this might be good.\n\nBut actually, looking at the data again: In hand #26, they raised preflop. That's their only non-fold action. They've folded 9/10 times. But they just limped this hand, which is unusual for their pattern. Maybe they have a hand they want to see a flop with.\n\nI think checking is the conservative, correct play with 22 from BB against a limper. We take a free flop, hope to hit a set, and minimize risk. If we miss, we can fold easily.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 22 has good implied odds if we hit a set (\u224812.5% chance).

Preflop action: SB posted 2, I posted BB 4, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called, SB folded, I checked. So heads-up against Kimi-K2 Thinking who called from UTG? Actually Seat 1 is UTG? Let's see: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, Seat 2 is SB, Seat 3 is me (BB), Seat 4 is Button, Seat 5 is CO? Wait, typical 5-handed: Seat 1 UTG, Seat 2 SB, Seat 3 BB, Seat 4 Button, Seat 5 CO? Actually with 5 players: Button is Seat 4, CO is Seat 5, UTG is Seat 1, SB is Seat 2, BB is me. Yes.\n\nSo preflop: UTG called, SB folded, I checked. So I have pocket deuces. The flop is Jd As 8h. This is a terrible flop for pocket deuces. There's an Ace and a Jack, both overcards. I have bottom pair, but the Ace is a big overcard. UTG called preflop from UTG, which could be a wide range but likely includes many hands that hit this flop: AJ, A8, maybe suited connectors, maybe small pairs. They could have an Ace, a Jack, maybe a draw. My hand is weak.\n\nI need to decide whether to check or raise. I have position? Actually I'm BB, UTG is first to act postflop? Wait, postflop action: The flop is dealt, and now action starts with the first player after the button. The button is Seat 4 (folded). So first to act is Seat 5 (folded), then Seat 1 (UTG), then me (BB). Actually after button, the order is SB (folded), BB (me), UTG (Seat 1). Wait, typical order: Button acts last. So after flop, action starts with the first active player to the left of the button. Button is Seat 4 (folded). So next is Seat 5 (folded), then Seat 1 (UTG), then Seat 2 (SB folded), then me (BB). So UTG acts before me. But the prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check, raise\". That suggests it's my action now. Maybe UTG checked? The prompt doesn't show flop actions yet. It says \"Actions this hand:\" only shows preflop actions. So flop actions haven't happened yet. So I need to act first? Actually I'm BB, and UTG called preflop, so there are two players: UTG and me. Postflop, the first to act is the player closest to the left of the button. Button is Seat 4 (folded). So first active player is Seat 5 (folded), then Seat 1 (UTG). So UTG acts first. But maybe the prompt is showing that it's my action because UTG checked? The prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\". That means no bet facing me. So UTG must have checked. So I can check or raise.\n\nThus I should decide whether to bet or check. With bottom pair on a board with an Ace, likely UTG has an Ace sometimes. But they called preflop from UTG, which could be a wide range including small pairs, suited connectors, maybe some Ax hands. They might have an Ace, but they might also have a hand like 99-TT, maybe KQ, etc. If they have an Ace, they'll likely call or raise. If they have a weaker hand, they might fold.\n\nMy hand is weak but I have a pair. I could try to bet to represent an Ace and get folds from weaker hands. However, my stack is 195 chips (48.8 BB). The pot is 10 chips. A bet of maybe 5-8 chips could be reasonable. But if I get called, I'm likely behind. I have backdoor straight draws? Not really. Backdoor flush draw? I have 2d, board has Jd, so I have a backdoor diamond flush draw. That's something.\n\nI should consider opponent tendencies. Let's use recall_opponent_actions to see how Kimi-K2 Thinking plays.

They seem tight, folding many hands preflop. They called preflop this hand (hand 36). That suggests they have a decent hand, maybe medium pair, suited connectors, or maybe Ax suited. They didn't raise, so probably not premium like AA, KK, QQ, maybe not AK. Could be AJ, AT, maybe 99-TT, maybe suited connectors like JTs, 89s.\n\nGiven they called from UTG, their range is somewhat strong but not raising strong. On this flop with A J 8, they could have hit an Ace, a Jack, maybe a draw. My pocket deuces are likely behind. However, they might have missed entirely with hands like KQ, QT, T9, etc. If they have a small pair like 99-TT, they might be scared of the Ace.\n\nI could try a small bet to take the pot down. Pot is 10 chips. A bet of 6 chips (half pot) might get folds from hands that missed. If they call, I can reevaluate on turn. But if they raise, I'll have to fold.\n\nMy stack is 195 chips, so I have room to maneuver. However, I'm out of position (they act after me on future streets). That's a disadvantage. Actually wait: I'm BB, they are UTG. Postflop, the order is: UTG acts first, then me. But UTG checked, so now I act. If I bet, they will act after me. So I'm in position for this street? Actually after flop, UTG checked, I can bet, then UTG decides. So I'm last to act on this street, which is good. But on turn and river, the order will be UTG first, then me (since button is folded). So I'll be out of position on future streets. That's bad.\n\nGiven my weak hand and being out of position, maybe checking is better. I can see a free turn card. If turn is a 2, I improve to trips. If turn is a diamond, I get flush draw. Otherwise, I can fold if they bet.\n\nChecking seems reasonable. Let's also search for similar situations. Use search_observations for \"pocket deuces\" or \"22 flop\". But time is limited.\n\nI think checking is fine. I'll check and see what opponent does. If they bet on turn, I can fold. If they check, I can maybe bet on turn if I improve or if board gets scarier.\n\nThus I'll check.",

Our hand is too weak to value bet, and checking allows potential bluff on river if opponent shows weakness.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this situation. We're at the turn with pocket deuces (2d 2c) on a board of Jd As 8h 9d. The pot is only 10 chips. We're in the BB, and the only opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking in seat 1 who limped preflop and checked the flop.\n\nFrom the opponent data I recalled, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding a lot preflop (folded 8 of the last 10 actions). The only raise was hand 26 preflop, and the only other non-fold was hand 25 where they folded on the flop. This suggests they're playing tight/passive.\n\nOur hand is pocket deuces - we have bottom pair but it's a very weak pair on this board. The board has Ace high with J, 8, 9. There's a straight draw possibility (T-Q for a straight), and a flush draw with diamonds (we have 2d, so we have a backdoor diamond draw).\n\nThe pot is tiny (10 chips). We're first to act on the turn. We could:\n1. Check and see what opponent does\n2. Bet small to try to take down the pot\n\nGiven opponent's tight/passive tendencies, they likely have a weak hand if they just limped preflop and checked flop. They might have a small pocket pair, suited connectors, or weak Ace. They might fold to any bet.\n\nHowever, our hand is also very weak. We're essentially bluffing if we bet. But the pot is small, and we have position (we act after them on the river if we check now).\n\nActually, wait - I need to check the action order. We're in BB, they're in seat 1. On the turn, we act first since we're OOP. So if we check, they get to act last on both turn and river.\n\nGiven the small pot and our weak hand, checking seems reasonable. We can see if they bet, and if they do, we can fold. If they check behind, we get a free river card and might improve to trips or a backdoor flush.\n\nBut actually, we have a very weak pair. If we bet and they call, we're likely behind. If we check and they bet, we'll have to fold. So maybe a small bet could take it down.\n\nLet me think about pot odds. If we bet 4 chips (minimum), we're risking 4 to win 10, so we need them to fold 28.6% of the time (4/(10+4)). Given their tight/passive play, they might fold a lot.\n\nBut if they call, we're likely behind and have only 2 outs to improve (two remaining deuces). That's about 4% chance to hit trips on river.\n\nActually, wait - we also have a backdoor flush draw with the 2d. That's about 4% additional equity. So total ~8% chance to improve on river.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, we have 48.8 BB stack, which is healthy. No need to take big risks.\n\nI think checking is the best play. We keep the pot small, get to see a free river, and can evaluate then. If opponent bets, we can easily fold our weak hand.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: The opponent limped preflop and checked flop. They likely have a weak hand. A small bet might take it down immediately. But if they call, we're in a bad spot on the river.\n\nGiven their tight tendencies (lots of preflop folds), they might fold to any bet. But they did limp this hand, so they have something.\n\nI think checking is safer and allows us to potentially bluff on the river if we sense weakness.\n\nI'll check.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have 2d 2c - pocket deuces, a very weak hand\n- Board: Jd As 8h 9d 5h\n- My hand: pocket deuces, no pair on board, no flush draws, no straight draws\n- Best possible hand: one pair of deuces, which is beaten by any pair on board (J, A, 8, 9, 5)\n- Pot: 10 chips\n- My stack: 195 chips (48.8 BB)\n- Opponent (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking): 233 chips\n- Action: River, amount to call = 0, I can check or raise\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown hands like 9d Jd (pair of 9s) and 8s 6d (pair of 8s) in previous showdowns\n- Mostly passive play: lots of checks and folds, some calls\n- Only one raise observed (hand 26 preflop raise to 14)\n- In hand 24, called 8 on river with 8s 6d on board 5d 5h 3h 7s 4h (had pair of 8s)\n\n**Current hand flow:**\n- Preflop: Opponent called BB from UTG, I checked BB with 22\n- Flop: Both checked\n- Turn: Both checked  \n- River: My action first\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. My hand is extremely weak - bottom pair that doesn't beat any board card\n2. Opponent has checked twice already (flop and turn)\n3. Opponent is generally passive\n4. Pot is small (10 chips)\n5. I'm in position (acting first on river)\n\n**Possible lines:**\n- Check: Likely go to showdown, hope opponent also checks and my deuces somehow win\n- Raise/bluff: Try to steal the pot with a bet\n\n**Bluff considerations:**\n- Board has A and J high, could represent an Ace or Jack\n- Opponent has shown willingness to call rivers with marginal hands (hand 24 called 8 with pair of 8s)\n- Opponent checked twice, suggesting weakness\n- If I bet small (4-8 chips), giving 2:1 or 3:1 odds, might get a fold\n- But opponent called river bet in hand 24 with just pair of 8s\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 48.8 BB, healthy stack\n- Risking 4-8 chips to win 10 is reasonable\n- But if called, I lose showdown with bottom pair\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to call rivers with marginal hands (pair of 8s in hand 24), and my hand is literally the worst possible pair (deuces), a bluff might not work. However, the opponent has shown passivity and checked twice. A small bet might take it down.\n\nBut actually, thinking more: The board has A high. If opponent had an Ace, they likely would have bet at some point. They checked flop and turn. They could have a weak Jack, 9, 8, or 5, or a missed draw. My deuces lose to all of those.\n\nI think a small bluff could work. Let's bet 4 chips (minimum raise). If opponent calls with any pair, I lose, but they might fold a weak hand.\n\nActually wait - I'm the BB, I already have 4 chips in the pot from my blind. The pot is 10 chips total. If I bet 4 more, that's risking 4 to win 10, giving opponent 3.5:1 odds. That's a good price for them to call with any pair.\n\nMaybe I should check and hope they check behind. But if they bet, I'd have to fold.\n\nGiven opponent's passivity and my weak hand, I think checking is safer. The pot is small, not worth bluffing.\n\n**Final decision:** Check and go to showdown. If opponent bets, I fold. If opponent checks, I show down my deuces and likely lose, but only lose the 4 chips I already put in.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket deuces is bottom pair on A-high board, loses to any pair.

I'm in the BB, opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking is in seat 1. The action is on me to act first on the river. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand is very weak - bottom pair with deuces on an A-high board. The board has no flush possibilities (two diamonds but not three of same suit), straight possibilities: there's a possible straight with T-Q, but not with the current cards. My deuces are likely only beating a complete bluff.\n\nThe opponent has checked twice (flop and turn), suggesting weakness. They just called preflop from UTG, so their range is wide but likely includes some Aces, maybe weak Jacks, middle pairs, suited connectors.\n\nGiven the small pot (10 chips) and my weak hand, a check seems correct. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands. The opponent might call with any pair, maybe even Ace-high. A bluff raise could work if opponent has complete air, but given they called preflop and checked twice, they might have something like a weak pair or draw that missed.\n\nLooking at opponent's river actions: they've folded once, checked once, called once in previous hands. Not enough data to determine strong tendencies.\n\nMy stack is 195 chips (48.8 BB), healthy. The pot is tiny relative to stacks. No need to risk chips with a weak hand.\n\nI should check and hope to win at showdown if opponent also checks or if they bluff and I call? Actually, if I check and they bet, I'd have to decide whether to call. But checking seems right now.\n\nSo action: check.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with pocket 5s (5h 5c). The board is 8d Td Qs. I have a small pair with a gutshot straight draw (need a 9 for 5-9 straight, but the Q and T are high cards). The board has two diamonds, so there's a flush draw possibility. I have bottom pair.\n\nThe pot is 24 chips. I'm first to act on the flop since the raiser (Seat 2: Kimi-K2) is the only other player. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nFrom the opponent data: Kimi-K2 seems fairly tight - they've folded a lot preflop (hands 31-36). They raised preflop this hand to 10 (2.5x BB). They have 200 chips (50 BB). Their flop tendencies show they usually check (4 checks, 1 fold when facing action).\n\nMy hand: Pocket 5s is vulnerable. The board has Q, T, 8 - all higher than my pair. I have a weak pair with poor kicker. If opponent has any Q, T, 8, or overpair, I'm in bad shape. I also have backdoor straight potential if a 9 comes.\n\nGiven opponent's tight tendencies and that they raised preflop, their range likely includes: pocket pairs 66+, suited connectors, broadway cards. The Q on board likely hits some of their range (AQ, KQ, QJ, QT). The T also hits AT, KT, JT, TT.\n\nI should check and see what opponent does. If they bet, I'll have to consider pot odds. The pot is 24, and I have 175 left (after investing 10 preflop: 2 SB + 8 call). If they bet small (say 12), I'd be getting 3:1 odds. But with bottom pair on a wet board, it's marginal.\n\nActually, checking seems best. I can see if opponent checks behind, then I get a free turn card. If they bet, I can evaluate. Raising seems bad because I don't want to build a big pot with a weak hand against a preflop raiser.\n\nLet me check.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\nWe're at the turn in Hand #37. I'm in the BB with 5h 5c. The board is 8d Td Qs 5d. I have bottom set (three of a kind with 5s). This is a very strong hand - sets are generally strong, though the board is somewhat coordinated with a flush draw (three diamonds) and straight draws possible (J9, 97, etc.).\n\nPot is 24 chips. I checked on the flop, opponent checked back. Now it's my turn to act on the turn with no bet to call (amount to call: 0). I have legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been mostly folding preflop. In hand #30, they showed Ts 6s and checked down. They raised preflop this hand to 10, which is unusual given their folding tendency. They then checked back the flop. This suggests they might have a hand like a big pair (QQ, KK, AA) or maybe AQ, KQ, but they checked back the flop which is interesting.\n\nMy hand is very strong with bottom set. The board has flush and straight draws, so I should build the pot. However, I need to consider:\n1. My stack: 185 chips (46.2 BB) - healthy stack\n2. Opponent stack: 200 chips - similar size\n3. Position: I'm out of position (BB vs preflop raiser)\n4. Tournament considerations: I want to accumulate chips\n\nGiven the flush draw on board, I should bet to charge draws. If I check, opponent might check behind with a weak hand or bet with a strong hand. Since I have a strong made hand, I should bet for value.\n\nThe minimum raise is to 6, but I can bet any amount. I should bet enough to charge flush draws but not so much that I fold out worse hands. A reasonable bet would be around 12-16 chips (half to 2/3 pot).\n\nLet me think about opponent's range: They raised preflop, checked flop. Could have: QQ (top set), TT (middle set), 88 (bottom set), AQ, KQ, QJ, maybe flush draws like AdKd, AdJd, etc. My bottom set beats everything except QQ and TT. QQ is unlikely since I have a 5, board has Q, so they'd need QQ. TT is possible but less likely.\n\nI should bet for value. Let's go with a 2/3 pot bet of 16 chips.",

The blinds are small relative to my stack, but that doesn't mean I should play weak hands from early position.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. However, with such a weak hand, pot odds aren't the main consideration - hand strength and position are more important.\n\nTournament considerations: I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots. Playing 9-8 offsuit from UTG is likely to get me into trouble.\n\nLet me check if there are any opponent tendencies I should consider, but with such a weak hand, I should probably just fold.

My stack is 209 chips (52.2 BB), so I'm deep enough to be selective. The BB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 239 chips. Looking at the opponent history, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding preflop in recent hands, but that doesn't tell me much about their postflop play.\n\nPlaying 98o from UTG is generally a fold in most poker strategies. The hand has poor equity, is easily dominated, and being out of position makes it even worse. Even if I hit a pair, I could be up against higher pairs or better kickers. The only reason to play would be if I think I can outplay opponents postflop, but from UTG that's difficult.\n\nThe pot is only 6 chips, and I need to call 4 chips to see a flop. That's not terrible pot odds (1.5:1), but implied odds are poor because I'm out of position and the hand doesn't have great drawing potential. Even if I flop a straight draw, it's a gutshot with 98o.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and stack size, the correct play is to fold. I should preserve my chips for better spots. Let me also check if there are any other factors. The table has 5 players, so it's not a full table, but still, UTG with 98o is a clear fold.\n\nI'll respond with the JSON object.",

No connectivity, no suitedness, low cards. It's a pure fold from UTG.\n\n2. **Position**: Being UTG means I have to act first preflop and will be out of position for the entire hand. This makes playing weak hands even worse.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 209 chips (52.2 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with junk hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the data:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some reasonable play. Folded often but called with pocket 4s once. \n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Raised preflop once in hand 37 to 10 chips. Mostly folds otherwise.\n   - Still 3 players left to act behind me (seats 4, 5, and then back to 1).\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should preserve chips and wait for better spots. Playing 7-4o from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 6 chips, I need to call 4 to see a flop. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, but with such a terrible hand, implied odds are poor because even if I hit something, it's hard to know if I'm ahead with 7-4.\n\n7. **My recent history**: Looking at my last 10 hands, I've been folding a lot (which is correct with weak hands). I've won a couple with decent hands (pocket 10s, pocket 5s). I should continue this disciplined approach.\n\nThis is an easy fold. Playing this hand would be a significant mistake. Even calling the BB is bad because I'll be out of position with a terrible hand, and I'll likely have to fold to any aggression post-flop.\n\nThe only reasonable action is fold."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\nI'm in UTG position with 7h 4s. This is an extremely weak hand - 7-4 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker, especially from early position. \n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Hand strength**: 7-4 offsuit is terrible. No connectivity, no suitedness, low cards. It's a pure fold from UTG.\n\n2. **Position**: Being UTG means I have to act first preflop and will be out of position for the entire hand. This makes playing weak hands even worse.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 209 chips (52.2 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with junk hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the data:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some reasonable play. Folded often but called with pocket 4s once. \n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Raised preflop once in hand 37 to 10 chips. Mostly folds otherwise.\n   - Still 3 players left to act behind me (seats 4, 5, and then back to 1).\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should preserve chips and wait for better spots. Playing 7-4o from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 6 chips, I need to call 4 to see a flop. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, but with such a terrible hand, implied odds are poor because even if I hit something, it's hard to know if I'm ahead with 7-4.\n\n7. **My recent history**: Looking at my last 10 hands, I've been folding a lot (which is correct with weak hands). I've won a couple with decent hands (pocket 10s, pocket 5s). I should continue this disciplined approach.\n\nThis is an easy fold. Playing this hand would be a significant mistake. Even calling the BB is bad because I'll be out of position with a terrible hand, and I'll likely have to fold to any aggression post-flop.\n\nThe only reasonable action is fold.",

Fold and wait for better spots.\"\n\nThat covers the key points: hand strength, position, stack preservation.

It's offsuit with no straight potential preflop. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm in the SB, which is the worst position postflop. I'll have to act first on every street, making it difficult to play this weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:**\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop 8 times in previous hands. Shows aggressive tendencies. Their raises have been: 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 12, 10 chips. This raise to 24 is larger than previous raises, suggesting stronger hand or adjusting to table dynamics.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has called preflop 6 times, showing loose calling tendencies. Showed down weak hands like 2s5s, 6c7d, 8d7s.\n\n4. **Pot odds:** Pot is 40 chips, need to call 16 chips. That's 2.5:1 pot odds (40:16). However, with Q4o, even with these odds, the hand is too weak to continue, especially out of position.\n\n5. **Stack considerations:** I have 201 chips (25.1 BB). Calling 16 chips would put 8% of my stack in the pot with a very weak hand. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n6. **Tournament implications:** With 25 BB, I'm not in push/fold territory yet, but need to be selective. Q4o from SB facing a raise is an easy fold.\n\n7. **Additional factor:** Seat 5 has already called, so there will be at least 2 opponents if I call. This makes my weak hand even worse.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an easy fold. Q4o from SB facing a raise is not playable. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify playing such a weak hand out of position against likely stronger ranges.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand:** Qc 4d (Queen of clubs, 4 of diamonds) from the SB (small blind)\n**Position:** SB (Seat 3)\n**Stack:** 201 chips (25.1 BB)\n**Blinds:** 4/8\n**Pot:** 40 chips\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Seat 2 (SB position, but posted SB 4) raised to 24 total (16 more to call)\n- Seat 5 called 8 initially\n- Seat 4 folded\n- Seat 1 folded\n\n**Amount to call:** 16 chips\n**Minimum raise to:** 40 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength:** Q4o is a very weak hand, especially from out of position (SB). It's offsuit with no straight potential preflop. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm in the SB, which is the worst position postflop. I'll have to act first on every street, making it difficult to play this weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:**\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop 8 times in previous hands. Shows aggressive tendencies. Their raises have been: 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 12, 10 chips. This raise to 24 is larger than previous raises, suggesting stronger hand or adjusting to table dynamics.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has called preflop 6 times, showing loose calling tendencies. Showed down weak hands like 2s5s, 6c7d, 8d7s.\n\n4. **Pot odds:** Pot is 40 chips, need to call 16 chips. That's 2.5:1 pot odds (40:16). However, with Q4o, even with these odds, the hand is too weak to continue, especially out of position.\n\n5. **Stack considerations:** I have 201 chips (25.1 BB). Calling 16 chips would put 8% of my stack in the pot with a very weak hand. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n6. **Tournament implications:** With 25 BB, I'm not in push/fold territory yet, but need to be selective. Q4o from SB facing a raise is an easy fold.\n\n7. **Additional factor:** Seat 5 has already called, so there will be at least 2 opponents if I call. This makes my weak hand even worse.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an easy fold. Q4o from SB facing a raise is not playable. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify playing such a weak hand out of position against likely stronger ranges.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

Pot odds of 2.5:1 don't justify playing such a weak hand against likely stronger ranges. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\"\n}\n\nWait, I need to check the action again. The amount to call is 16, and I have legal actions: fold, call, raise. Yes, fold is an option. My reasoning should be brief but clear.\n\nActually, let me check: I'm in SB, posted BB? Wait, the hand says: Seat 2 post_sb 4, Seat 3 post_bb 8. So I'm Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) and posted BB 8. So I'm in BB, not SB? The position says \"Your Position: SB (Seat 3)\" but the actions show Seat 2 posted SB 4 and Seat 3 posted BB 8. That seems like a contradiction. Maybe there's a mislabel? Actually, looking at the table: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 is Kimi-K2, Seat 3 is me, Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 called. So Seat 2 posted SB 4, I posted BB 8. So I'm actually in BB position, but the system says \"Your Position: SB (Seat 3)\". This might be a labeling issue in the hand history. Regardless, I'm out of position relative to the raiser (Seat 2) and the caller (Seat 5).\n\nMy analysis stands: Q4o is weak, facing a raise from aggressive player, with another caller already in. Fold.\n\nI'll respond with JSON.",

We're also short-stacked (24.6 BB), so we need to be selective.\n\nIn tournament poker from the SB with a weak hand facing a raise, folding is standard. The BB is yet to act behind us, which adds pressure.\n\nHowever, we could consider a 3-bet bluff since the opponent might be raising light, but with Q6o and being out of position, that's risky. Our stack is short enough that we shouldn't be playing speculative hands.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. We have 24.6 BB left, which is still playable.\n\n**Decision**: Fold."

Their recent raises: 6, 6, 8, 6, 6, 8, 12, 10, and now 24. This 24 is their largest raise so far, which might indicate a stronger hand than usual.\n\nOur hand (Q6o) is weak, especially from the SB position. We're out of position for the entire hand if we call. We'd need to put in 20 chips to win 36, giving us pot odds of 20:36 or 1:1.8. We need about 35% equity to call.\n\nAgainst a typical raising range from early position (UTG+1), Q6o has very poor equity. Even against a wider range, it's not great. We're also short-stacked (24.6 BB), so we need to be selective.\n\nIn tournament poker from the SB with a weak hand facing a raise, folding is standard. The BB is yet to act behind us, which adds pressure.\n\nHowever, we could consider a 3-bet bluff since the opponent might be raising light, but with Q6o and being out of position, that's risky. Our stack is short enough that we shouldn't be playing speculative hands.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. We have 24.6 BB left, which is still playable.\n\n**Decision**: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop decision. I have 5h Qd on the button with 197 chips (24.6 BB). Blinds are 4/8. Both players in front folded, so it's just me vs the SB (MiniMax-M2) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B). Amount to call is 8 (the BB), minimum raise to 16.\n\nMy hand is Q5o, which is a weak hand. Queen-high with a bad kicker, offsuit. However, I'm on the button, which is the best position. Let me consider the opponents:\n\nFrom the search results:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has shown some aggression - raised with 7h4s from UTG (hand 40), called with 2s4s from SB (hand 33). Seems to play a wide range.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has raised with 3c2d from SB (hand 32), called a raise with 7h4s (hand 40). Also seems to play somewhat loose.\n\nMy stack is 197 chips (24.6 BB), which is decent but not huge. The BB has 132 chips (16.5 BB), SB has 188 chips (23.5 BB).\n\nPosition is key here. On the button, I can steal the blinds or see a flop cheaply and potentially outplay opponents postflop. However, Q5o is really weak - it's not a good stealing hand. The queen is decent but the 5 kicker is terrible.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 12 (4 SB + 8 BB). That's 1.5:1 odds, or 40% equity needed. Q5o likely has less than 40% equity against two random hands, especially given the BB will be in the pot.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 24.6 BB, which is a workable stack. I shouldn't risk it with marginal hands.\n\nLooking at my hand history: I've been folding a lot of weak hands (which is good). I raised with TT from CO (hand 34) and won. I called with 55 from SB (hand 37) and won. So I've been playing reasonably tight.\n\nGiven all this: Q5o is a clear fold from any position, even on the button. The hand is too weak to play, even for a steal attempt. The risk of getting called and playing a weak hand out of position (well, actually I'd have position postflop) isn't worth it. Better to wait for a better spot.\n\nI should fold and preserve my stack for a better hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm UTG (under the gun) with pocket deuces. This is a very weak starting hand, especially from early position. I have 197 chips (24.6 BB). The blinds are 4/8.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking, BB): Has been folding a lot preflop (folded last 4 hands preflop). Showed 44 in hand 36 and lost.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Folded last 3 hands preflop. Raised to 12 in hand 40 with something.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B, SB): Has been folding a lot too.\n\nFrom my own history, I just had pocket deuces in hand 36 (when I was BB) and lost with them. Pocket pairs can be good for set mining, but from UTG with 2s, it's very marginal.\n\nStack sizes:\n- Me: 197 (24.6 BB)\n- Seat 4: 188 (23.5 BB) - will act after me\n- Seat 5: 140 (17.5 BB) - already posted SB\n- Seat 1: 239 (29.9 BB) - posted BB\n\nIf I call 8 chips, that's 4% of my stack. For set mining, the general rule is you need implied odds of about 10:1 or more. With pocket deuces, I need to flop a set to have a strong hand. The pot is currently 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8). If I call, pot becomes 20.\n\nIf I flop a set, I could potentially win a big pot, but from UTG, I'll be out of position against 3 players behind me. Also, with my stack at 24.6 BB, I don't have deep enough stacks for good implied odds.\n\nLooking at tournament considerations: I'm not in dire straits with 24.6 BB, but I'm not super deep either. Playing pocket deuces from UTG is generally a fold in tournament poker, especially at this stack depth.\n\nThe alternative is to raise, but raising with 22 from UTG would be a bluff and likely get called by better hands. I could potentially steal the blinds, but with 3 players behind including the BB who has 29.9 BB, it's risky.\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies showing lots of folds recently, there might be some fold equity, but 22 is just too weak to open-raise from UTG.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. The 8 chips to call is not much, but playing 22 out of position with marginal implied odds is not good.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has shown some aggression with raises preflop (hands 37, 41, 42).\n3. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has been somewhat active with some raises and calls.\n4. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) - no data yet but will be in position after me.\n\nMy stack is 197 chips (24.6 BB). Blinds are 4/8. I need to call 8 chips to see the flop, which is 4% of my stack.\n\nWith 83o from UTG, this is an easy fold. Even if I call, I'll be out of position against 4 other players, and the hand has very little potential to make strong hands. 83o has poor connectivity, low cards, and offsuit. It's a classic \"fold pre\" hand.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a medium stack (24.6 BB) - not short enough to be desperate, but not deep enough to be speculating with such weak hands. Preserving my stack for better spots is crucial.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 into a pot of 12, giving me 1.5:1 odds, but implied odds are poor because I'm out of position and the hand is weak.\n\nDecision: Fold.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"83o from UTG is one of the weakest starting hands.

Looking at the opponent data, I see Seat 1 has been folding a lot preflop (14 out of 20 recorded actions are folds). They've only called once (hand 36) and checked twice (hands 39 and 44). This is actually their first raise that I can see in the data.\n\nMy stack is 189 chips (23.6 BB). The pot is 36 chips (8 BB + 4 SB + 24 raise). I need to call 16 chips to continue.\n\nPot odds: 16 to win 36, so I need ~31% equity. 8d 6h offsuit has very poor equity against a UTG raising range. Even against a wide range, it's only around 30-35% equity. Against a tighter UTG range, it's worse.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 23.6 BB, which is not desperate but not deep either. I'm in the BB with a weak hand facing a raise from UTG. This is an easy fold spot.\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: they've been very passive/fold-heavy, so this raise might indicate a stronger hand. They showed 44 in hand 36 (small pocket pair) and 96o in hand 21, 86o in hand 24. But those were likely in different positions.\n\nGiven my weak hand (8d 6h offsuit), poor position (out of position postflop), and the fact that this is a raise from UTG from an opponent who rarely raises, this is an easy fold.\n\nI should preserve my stack for better spots. The pot odds aren't compelling enough to justify playing such a weak hand out of position."

Looking at the opponent data, I see Seat 1 has been folding a lot preflop (14 out of 20 recorded actions are folds). They've only called once (hand 36) and checked twice (hands 39 and 44). This is actually their first raise that I can see in the data.\n\nMy stack is 189 chips (23.6 BB). The pot is 36 chips (8 BB + 4 SB + 24 raise). I need to call 16 chips to continue.\n\nPot odds: 16 to win 36, so I need ~31% equity. 8d 6h offsuit has very poor equity against a UTG raising range. Even against a wide range, it's only around 30-35% equity. Against a tighter UTG range, it's worse.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 23.6 BB, which is not desperate but not deep either. I'm in the BB with a weak hand facing a raise from UTG. This is an easy fold spot.\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: they've been very passive/fold-heavy, so this raise might indicate a stronger hand. They showed 44 in hand 36 (small pocket pair) and 96o in hand 21, 86o in hand 24. But those were likely in different positions.\n\nGiven my weak hand (8d 6h offsuit), poor position (out of position postflop), and the fact that this is a raise from UTG from an opponent who rarely raises, this is an easy fold.\n\nI should preserve my stack for better spots. The pot odds aren't compelling enough to justify playing such a weak hand out of position.",

It has very little postflop potential.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is good, but with such a weak hand, position advantage is minimal.\n3. **Pot Odds**: Calling 4 to win 12 gives me 3:1 odds. However, implied odds are poor because 93o rarely makes strong hands.\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: With 23BB, I'm not in dire need to gamble with trash hands. Better to preserve chips.\n5. **Opponent Behavior**: BB has been folding a lot recently, but if he has any hand at all, he'll likely continue postflop.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is an easy fold. 93o has almost no value, even from the button. The small 4-chip call might seem tempting with pot odds, but this hand will frequently put me in difficult spots postflop with marginal holdings. Better to wait for a better spot.\n\n**Action**: Fold.",

My stack is 185 chips (23.1 BB). Blinds are 4/8. The small blind (Seat 4) posted 4, big blind (Seat 5) posted 8. Two players folded, so it's folded to me on the button.\n\nI have 9T suited connectors (though not suited - one club, one heart). This is a decent speculative hand from the button, especially with fold equity. The blinds have 180 and 132 chips respectively. I need to call 8 to see a flop, or I can raise to 16 minimum.\n\nPosition is excellent - I'm on the button. With two players in the blinds, I have good stealing potential. 9T has decent playability postflop, especially from position.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 23.1 BB, which is getting into push/fold territory but not quite there yet. The blinds have similar stacks.\n\nStandard play here would be to raise to steal the blinds, or possibly call to see a flop cheaply. Given my position and hand strength, I should probably raise. A standard raise would be 2.5-3x, so 20-24 chips. The minimum raise is to 16, but I should raise more to deny odds.\n\nLet me check if I have any history on these opponents. But first, I need to make a decision. I'll raise to 20 chips (2.5x). This puts pressure on the blinds and gives me initiative.\n\nReasoning: On the button with 9T, excellent position, good stealing opportunity against two blinds. Raising to 20 chips (2.5x) applies pressure and denies odds. If called, I have position and a hand that can make strong draws or pairs.",

Q5o has poor playability and is easily dominated.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (first to act after blinds) - Worst position at the table. I have to act first on every street, making it difficult to play speculative hands.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 197 chips (24.6 BB) - This is a medium stack. Not so short that I need to push with any two cards, but not deep enough to play speculative hands from early position.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, Seat 1): Has shown some aggression (raised to 24 from BB in hand #46 with 86o). Could defend wide in BB.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has folded to raises, called once from CO with 22.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Small blind, has folded frequently.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 24.6 BB, I should be looking for better spots. Q5o is a clear fold from UTG. Even if I limp, I'll be out of position against multiple opponents with a hand that rarely improves to anything strong.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Need to call 8 chips into 12 pot (20 total if I call). Getting 1.5:1 odds, but with such a weak hand and poor position, implied odds are terrible.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is an easy fold. Q5o from UTG is unplayable. Better to wait for a better spot in better position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q5o is too weak from UTG position.

The Ace is good, but the 7 kicker is weak. With 5 players left to act behind me (including the blinds), this hand is likely not strong enough to open with.\n\nIn tournament poker, position matters a lot.

Folding here preserves my stack for stronger hands in better positions.\n\nThe pot odds are: calling 8 to win 12 (pot is 12), so I need ~40% equity. Against random hands, A7o has about 40-45% equity, but against the ranges of players who might call or raise behind me, my equity is likely lower.\n\nGiven my tight image and the fact that I've been folding marginal hands from UTG, continuing with this hand would be a deviation from my strategy without a good reason.\n\nI should fold.",

The action: SB (Seat 2) posted 4, I posted 8, then Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called 8, and SB (Kimi-K2) called the additional 4. So there's 24 chips in the pot (4+8+8+4). I have 189 chips (23.6 BB). Amount to call is 0 - I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand: K5 offsuit is not strong. But I'm getting a free look at the flop from the BB with 2 players who have limped in. Both opponents seem somewhat active but not overly aggressive preflop based on history. Kimi-K2 Thinking has been limping/calling sometimes, Kimi-K2 has raised a few times but also folded a lot.\n\nGiven I'm getting to see the flop for free, and K5o is not a hand I want to invest chips with preflop, checking seems correct. Raising would be spewy with this hand. I have position (BB) postflop, but that's not great since I'll act first on flop.\n\nBetter to check, see a cheap flop, and evaluate. If I hit something strong (two pair, trips, etc), I can play. Otherwise fold.\n\nMy stack is 23.6 BB, which is getting short but not critical. No need to get fancy with K5o.\n\nLet me check.",

If I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot. If I bet and get called, I'm playing a big pot out of position with a marginal hand. Checking allows me to control pot size and see what Seat 1 does. Seat 1 has shown some aggression on flops, so if they bet, I can call and re-evaluate on turn.\n\nThe pot is only 24 chips, so not much to protect. I have top pair but vulnerable.

Board has flush draw (hearts) and straight draws (any 2 or 5 makes a straight). My hand is vulnerable.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has shown aggressive tendencies with raises preflop (hands 41, 42, 50). In hand 50, they went all-in preflop with TT. Their check on turn could be weakness or trapping.\n\nSeat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Called preflop, checked flop. Has shown some aggression on flops (hands 44, 49). Could have a wide range.\n\n**Position:** I'm out of position (BB), which is a disadvantage.\n\n**Stack Sizes:** I have 189 chips (23.6 BB), which is short but not desperate. Seat 1 has 271, Seat 2 has 332.\n\n**Pot Odds:** Pot is 24, no bet to call, so I can check for free.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. My hand is marginal top pair with weak kicker\n2. I'm out of position\n3. Board is draw-heavy (flush and straight draws)\n4. Opponents could be slow-playing strong hands\n5. With only 23.6 BB, I need to accumulate chips but also preserve stack\n\n**Options:**\n- Check: See a free river, keep pot small\n- Bet: Try to take down pot now, but risk being raised or called by draws\n\nGiven the draw-heavy board and my weak kicker, checking seems prudent. I can re-evaluate on river. If I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot with a marginal hand.\n\nAlso, I have 23.6 BB which is playable for tournament survival.

The pot is 44 chips and opponent (Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking) bet 20 after two checks on the turn. I need to call 20.\n\nLooking at opponent history: They've shown some aggression on flops (bet 8 on hand 39 flop, bet 12 on hand 44 flop, bet 20 on hand 49 flop). They seem to bet when checked to on flops. But this is a turn bet after everyone checked flop. The board is somewhat draw-heavy: there's a flush draw (hearts), straight draws (any 5 gives wheel, any 2 gives gutshot, any A gives open-ender). \n\nMy hand: Top pair weak kicker. Vulnerable to better Kings (KQ, KJ, KT, maybe even K9), sets (99, 33, 44), two pair (K9, K4, K3), and draws that could complete. The flush draw is concerning.\n\nStack sizes: I have 189 chips (23.6 BB), opponent has 251 chips. Pot odds: I need to call 20 to win 64 (44+20). That's about 31% pot odds. \n\nWhat range could opponent have? They limped preflop from UTG (Seat 1), so likely medium to weak hands. They checked flop, then bet turn when checked to. Could be value (Kx with better kicker, two pair, sets), could be semi-bluff with draws (heart flush draw, straight draws), or could be bluff trying to take it down.\n\nMy top pair is decent but not strong. Given I'm in position (BB acted first preflop, but now it's heads up and I act after opponent on river), I could call and evaluate river. But I'm worried about reverse implied odds - if I call and improve to two pair or trips, I might not get paid much, but if I'm behind now, I could lose more on river.\n\nLooking at opponent showdowns: They had 44 on hand 36 (hit trips on flop), had 86 on hand 24 (missed), had 9J on hand 21 (missed). They seem to play suited connectors and small pairs.\n\nGiven the board texture and my hand strength, I think this is a marginal spot. I have 31% pot odds, need ~31% equity. Let me estimate my equity: Against a range of better Kings (KQ, KJ, KT, K9), sets (99,33,44), two pair (K9, K4, K3), and flush draws (AhXh, QhJh, etc.), I probably have around 25-35% equity. Against a bluff/semi-bluff range (flush draws, straight draws), I have better equity.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 23.6 BB, which is getting short but not critical. Folding leaves me with 189 chips (23.6 BB). Calling and losing leaves me with 169 chips (21 BB). Not a huge difference.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to bet when checked to on flops, and now betting turn after checks, this could be a probe bet with a wide range. I think calling is reasonable to see river and potentially bluff catch if they check river. But raising seems risky with my marginal hand.\n\nI'll call and evaluate river. If river is a blank and opponent checks, I can check behind or bet small for value. If river completes draws and opponent bets, I can fold.\n\nWait, I should also consider that I have position on river (I act last). That's an advantage for calling.\n\nDecision: Call."

Not a huge difference.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to bet when checked to on flops, and now betting turn after checks, this could be a probe bet with a wide range. I think calling is reasonable to see river and potentially bluff catch if they check river. But raising seems risky with my marginal hand.\n\nI'll call and evaluate river. If river is a blank and opponent checks, I can check behind or bet small for value. If river completes draws and opponent bets, I can fold.\n\nWait, I should also consider that I have position on river (I act last). That's an advantage for calling.\n\nDecision: Call.",

No, board is 3,4,9,K,K, so possible straight is 5-6-7-8-9? Not on board. Actually board is 3,4,9,K,K. So possible straight is 5-6-7-8-9? That's a 5-card straight but board doesn't have 5,6,7,8. So no straight possible. Only possible hand that beats me is a full house: someone with 9-9 for quads? No, quads would be KKKK. Someone with 3-3, 4-4, 9-9 for full house? Actually with three kings on board, someone could have pocket 3s, 4s, or 9s for a full house (kings full of whatever). Also someone could have Kx with a better kicker than my 5.

Wait, the river action: I need to see current state. The prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check, raise\". That means opponent checked to me? Actually the turn action ended with me calling 20. Now river: presumably opponent checked? The prompt doesn't show river action yet. It says \"=== Hand #51 - RIVER ===\" and lists board with Kc. Then \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning no bet facing me. So opponent checked. So I have the option to check or raise (bet). I can check back or bet.\n\nI have trips with weak kicker. The river improved me to trips (I already had trips on turn? Wait: flop was 3d 4h Kh. I had K5, so pair of kings. Turn 9h gave me two pair? Actually I had K5, board K,3,4,9. So I had pair of kings with weak kicker. River K gave me three kings. So I improved from one pair to trips.\n\nOpponent bet 20 on turn. What could they have? They called preflop, checked flop, bet turn. Could be a flush draw (hearts), maybe 9x, maybe a pair of kings with better kicker, maybe a straight draw? But no straight draws obvious.

          "reasoning_content": "I see opponent's actions. They seem to fold a lot preflop, but when they call, they often bet on flop (hand 39, 44, 49). In hand 49, they called preflop (8 chips), then bet 20 on flop. That's similar pattern: call preflop, then bet flop. In this hand, they called preflop, checked flop, then bet turn. That's different. Maybe they have a draw? They checked flop, then bet turn when 9h came. Could be a heart draw, maybe 9hXh? Or maybe they have a pair of 9s. They checked river after king came. That suggests they're scared of the king.\n\nI need to see showdowns: hand 36 they had 44 and checked all streets. Hand 21 they had 9d Jd. Hand 24 they had 8s 6d. So they play some mediocre hands.\n\nMy hand is trips with weak kicker. I'm ahead of many hands: bluffs, pairs, draws. But lose to better kings, full houses. However, given opponent's line: call preflop (could be many hands), check flop (maybe weak or drawing), bet turn (could be value with 9x, or draw), check river (scared of king). Likely they have a hand like 9x, maybe 9T, 9J, etc. Or a heart draw that missed. They might call a small bet but fold to big bet.\n\nPot is 64 chips. I have 169 chips total. I could bet to get value from worse hands. What worse hands call? Possibly 9x, maybe pocket pairs lower than kings. Would they call with a worse king? Unlikely they have a worse king because kicker would be lower than 5? Possible they have K2, K3, K4? Those would be full house actually (K3 with board KKK3 would be full house kings full of 3s). Wait: if they have K3, board is KKK3, they have kings full of 3s. That beats my trips. But they'd likely bet river for value. They checked. So unlikely they have K3.\n\nIf they have Kx with worse kicker than 5 (K2, K3, K4), those are full houses. But they'd probably bet. So they likely don't have a king.\n\nThus they likely have a hand like 9x, or a busted draw. I should bet small for value. Maybe 20-30 chips. If they have 9x, they might call. If they have nothing, they fold. I could also check back and win showdown. But betting extracts value.\n\nMy stack is 169, pot 64. Betting 20 (like 1/3 pot) seems reasonable. If they raise, I'd have to consider folding? They might check-raise with a full house. But unlikely given their line.\n\nLet's search for similar situations. Use search for \"river\" \"king\" etc. But time is limited.\n\nI'll decide: bet small for value. Raise to 20 (minimum raise) or maybe 30. Minimum raise to is 20 (that's the minimum bet?). Actually \"Minimum raise to: 20\" means the minimum total bet is 20? Wait, amount to call is 0. Minimum raise to 20 means if I want to raise (bet), I need to put at least 20 chips total. That's a bet of 20 into 64 pot. That's about 31% pot. Reasonable.\n\nI'll bet 20. If they call, I likely win. If they raise, I might fold unless I think they're bluffing.\n\nThus action: raise to 20.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current hand:** I'm in the small blind with Kc4c (King-4 suited clubs). The pot is 44 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + UTG raise to 32). UTG (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 32 total (24 more than BB). I need to call 28 chips (32 - my 4 SB already posted).\n\n**My stack:** 249 chips (31.1 BB)\n**UTG stack:** 199 chips (24.9 BB)\n**BB stack:** 164 chips (20.5 BB)\n\n**Position:** I'm in SB, which is bad position for the rest of the hand. UTG raised, so I'm out of position against the raiser.\n\n**Hand strength:** K4s is a marginal hand. It's suited, which helps, but K4 has poor kicker issues and is dominated by many hands that UTG might raise with. As a suited connector, it's not great - K4 doesn't connect well.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at UTG's recent actions:\n- Hand 46: UTG raised to 24 preflop (3x BB)\n- Hand 47-48: Folded preflop\n- Hand 49: Called BB (limped), then bet flop\n- Hand 50: Folded preflop\n- Hand 51: Limped again, then check-called postflop\n\nUTG seems to be playing a mix of raising premium hands and limping with weaker ones. The current raise to 32 (4x BB) suggests a stronger hand than the 3x raise in hand 46.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 28 chips to win 44 chips (pot before my call). That's 28 to win 44, or about 1.57:1 odds, meaning I need ~39% equity to call. K4s vs a reasonable UTG raising range (maybe top 20%: 77+, A9s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KJo+) has only about 35-40% equity, so it's borderline.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 31.1 BB, which is a healthy stack. UTG has 24.9 BB, BB has 20.5 BB. I'm not in dire need of chips.\n\n**Position disadvantage:** Being in SB out of position against UTG raiser is a major problem. Even if I hit a piece of the flop, I'll have to act first on every street.\n\n**BB still to act:** The BB (MiniMax-M2) has yet to act behind me. If I call, BB might squeeze or call, creating a multiway pot where my hand equity improves but I'm still out of position.\n\n**Better alternative:** Folding seems prudent. K4s is not a hand I want to play for a 4x raise from UTG from the small blind. The suitedness gives some value, but the positional disadvantage and kicker issues make this a fold.\n\nLet me check if there's any history of UTG showing down weak hands after raising... Looking at showdowns: UTG showed 9dJd (hand 21), 8s6d (hand 24), 4s4h (hand 36), 8dTh (hand 51). These are mostly limped/called hands, not raised hands. The raised hand (hand 46) didn't go to showdown.\n\nGiven all this analysis, I should fold. The pot odds are borderline, but the positional disadvantage and tournament stack preservation considerations make folding correct.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button (BTN) with 249 chips (31.1 BB). This is a great position to play from.\n\n**My hand:** 8c 5c - suited connectors, but low ones. This is a speculative hand that plays well in position postflop, especially with suitedness.\n\n**Opponents:**\n1. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB): Has 112 chips (14 BB). From the data, they've been folding a lot preflop but occasionally calling. They just posted SB of 4.\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB): Has 283 chips (35.4 BB). They've shown some aggression - in hand 52 they raised preflop to 32 (4x BB) and then raised again on flop. They seem capable of aggression.\n\n**Action:** It's folded to me on the button. I need to call 8 chips to see the flop (1 BB). The pot is currently 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8).\n\n**Stack considerations:** I have 31.1 BB, which is healthy but not huge. The SB has only 14 BB and could be looking to shove with marginal hands.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** \n- MiniMax-M2 (SB) has folded most hands preflop but called twice recently. With only 14 BB, they might be getting desperate.\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB) has shown aggression but also called with marginal hands.\n\n**Hand analysis:** 85s is a speculative hand that needs help postflop. It can make straights and flushes, but it's weak preflop. The value comes from position and implied odds.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Conservative but reasonable given the low hand strength.\n2. **Call:** Taking a cheap flop in position with speculative hand. Risk is 8 chips to win potential pot.\n3. **Raise:** Could try to steal the blinds, but with 85s and two players left to act (including an aggressive BB), this seems risky.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 8 to win 20 (if both blinds call) or 12 (if SB folds). That's 1:1.5 or 1:2.5 pot odds. Not great for a weak hand.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I'm not in desperate chip situation. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n**Decision:** While being on the button with suited connectors is tempting, 85s is simply too weak. The BB has shown aggression and could re-raise. The SB is short-stacked and might shove. Better to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"85s is too weak even on button. BB has shown aggression and could re-raise. SB is short-stacked and may shove. Better to preserve chips for stronger spots with 31.1 BB stack.\"\n}",

My stack is 249 chips (31.1 BB), which is decent but not huge.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has shown some aggression with raises preflop (hand 52 raised to 32) and on flop (hand 52 raised to 80). Also capable of betting and calling.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has shown some aggression too (hand 50 raised to 60 then 164 preflop). Also has folded several times preflop.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has called preflop bets and shown some postflop aggression.\n\nI'm in early position (UTG) with a weak hand. In tournament poker, playing Q3o from UTG is generally a fold. The pot odds are 12:8 (1.5:1), but the implied odds are poor with such a weak hand.\n\nConsidering my tournament situation: I have 31.1 BB, which is a playable stack. However, Q3o has very little potential to make strong hands. Even if I hit a pair, it's vulnerable to overcards. The reverse implied odds are high - I could hit a weak pair and lose a lot of chips.\n\nGiven that I'm in early position and will have to act first postflop against 3 opponents (SB, BB, and MiniMax-M2 in CO), this is a clear fold.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns I should consider. Looking at the opponents, they seem capable of aggression, so calling could lead to being raised behind me.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q3o is too weak to play from UTG in a tournament.

This is a very weak hand - T4 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. However, I've already put in 8 chips as the big blind, and the only remaining opponent (Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking) has just called the BB, not raised.\n\nLooking at the opponent's preflop actions from the data:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has been fairly tight preflop (many folds)\n- They have raised preflop only twice (hand 46: raise to 24, hand 52: raise to 32)\n- They have called preflop a few times\n- In the most recent hand (54), they called 12 preflop (that was a bigger blind situation)\n- In hand 51, they called 8 preflop (similar situation)\n\nMy position: I'm in the BB with position on the flop (since opponent is UTG/button). This gives me a positional advantage post-flop.\n\nMy stack: 241 chips (30.1 BB) - healthy but not massive. The pot is currently 20 chips (4 from SB, 8 from BB, 8 from opponent).\n\nSince amount to call is 0, I can check. With such a weak hand (T4o), raising seems very risky. The opponent has shown they can call with marginal hands preflop, so if I raise, I'll likely get called and be playing a big pot out of position (actually I'll have position since I'm BB and they're UTG, but still).\n\nThe pot odds are irrelevant since it's free to check. Implied odds with T4o are terrible - this hand has very little potential to make strong hands. Best case is hitting a ten or a four, but even then it's weak.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack (30 BB), no need to take unnecessary risks with trash hands. Better to preserve chips.\n\nLooking at my own history: I've won some hands with aggressive plays, but those were with better starting hands (TT, A6, 55, etc.).\n\nDecision: Check and see a flop for free. If the flop hits me in some way (maybe a ten with good board texture), I can proceed cautiously. Otherwise, I can easily fold.\n\nLet me check if there are any patterns where opponent limps weak and then folds to aggression... Looking at the data, opponent has shown some aggression post-flop (raises on flop in hand 52). But with my weak hand, not worth trying to bluff.\n\nI'll check."

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the BB with 4s Th (four of spades, ten of hearts). This is a very weak hand - T4 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. However, I've already put in 8 chips as the big blind, and the only remaining opponent (Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking) has just called the BB, not raised.\n\nLooking at the opponent's preflop actions from the data:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has been fairly tight preflop (many folds)\n- They have raised preflop only twice (hand 46: raise to 24, hand 52: raise to 32)\n- They have called preflop a few times\n- In the most recent hand (54), they called 12 preflop (that was a bigger blind situation)\n- In hand 51, they called 8 preflop (similar situation)\n\nMy position: I'm in the BB with position on the flop (since opponent is UTG/button). This gives me a positional advantage post-flop.\n\nMy stack: 241 chips (30.1 BB) - healthy but not massive. The pot is currently 20 chips (4 from SB, 8 from BB, 8 from opponent).\n\nSince amount to call is 0, I can check. With such a weak hand (T4o), raising seems very risky. The opponent has shown they can call with marginal hands preflop, so if I raise, I'll likely get called and be playing a big pot out of position (actually I'll have position since I'm BB and they're UTG, but still).\n\nThe pot odds are irrelevant since it's free to check. Implied odds with T4o are terrible - this hand has very little potential to make strong hands. Best case is hitting a ten or a four, but even then it's weak.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack (30 BB), no need to take unnecessary risks with trash hands. Better to preserve chips.\n\nLooking at my own history: I've won some hands with aggressive plays, but those were with better starting hands (TT, A6, 55, etc.).\n\nDecision: Check and see a flop for free. If the flop hits me in some way (maybe a ten with good board texture), I can proceed cautiously. Otherwise, I can easily fold.\n\nLet me check if there are any patterns where opponent limps weak and then folds to aggression... Looking at the data, opponent has shown some aggression post-flop (raises on flop in hand 52). But with my weak hand, not worth trying to bluff.\n\nI'll check.",

With this weak hand, checking is the best play.\n\nMy reasoning: T4o is a very weak hand, but I've already invested 8 chips as BB. Since opponent only limped (didn't raise), I can see a free flop. Raising would be risky with such a weak hand against a player who has shown willingness to call preflop.

The opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking who has 247 chips (slightly more than my 241). The pot is 20 chips.\n\nFrom the opponent data, I can see Kimi-K2 Thinking is fairly aggressive on the flop. They've bet on the flop in hands 39, 44, 49, and 53. They also raised to 80 on the flop in hand 52. They check-folded in hand 54. So they're capable of both aggression and checking.\n\nMy hand: I have middle pair with weak kicker. The board is 3d Ts Kh. This is a relatively dry board with no flush draws (all different suits). There are straight draws possible (QJ, J9, A2 for gutshots). My hand is vulnerable - any ten with a better kicker beats me, any king beats me, and any pocket pair above ten beats me. I also have backdoor straight possibilities with 4-T.\n\nGiven my position as BB and opponent checked to me (since amount to call is 0), I have the option to check or bet. \n\nReasons to bet:\n- I have middle pair, could be best hand\n- Might get folds from weaker holdings\n- Can charge draws\n- Take initiative\n\nReasons to check:\n- Weak kicker makes hand vulnerable\n- Opponent might have a king or better ten\n- Opponent is aggressive and might check-raise\n- I'm out of position for rest of hand\n- Pot is small (20 chips)\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: they're aggressive but also capable of checking. They limped preflop (called 8), which suggests a weak to medium hand. Could be suited connectors, small pairs, or weak broadways.\n\nGiven I'm out of position with a marginal hand, checking seems prudent. I can see what opponent does on the turn. If they bet, I can evaluate then. If they check behind, I get a free card to improve.\n\nMy stack is 30BB, which is decent but not huge. No need to take unnecessary risks with marginal holdings.\n\nI'll check."

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have a good understanding of the situation. I'm in the BB with 4s Th. The board is 3d Ts Kh. I have middle pair with weak kicker (ten with 4 kicker). The opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking who has 247 chips (slightly more than my 241). The pot is 20 chips.\n\nFrom the opponent data, I can see Kimi-K2 Thinking is fairly aggressive on the flop. They've bet on the flop in hands 39, 44, 49, and 53. They also raised to 80 on the flop in hand 52. They check-folded in hand 54. So they're capable of both aggression and checking.\n\nMy hand: I have middle pair with weak kicker. The board is 3d Ts Kh. This is a relatively dry board with no flush draws (all different suits). There are straight draws possible (QJ, J9, A2 for gutshots). My hand is vulnerable - any ten with a better kicker beats me, any king beats me, and any pocket pair above ten beats me. I also have backdoor straight possibilities with 4-T.\n\nGiven my position as BB and opponent checked to me (since amount to call is 0), I have the option to check or bet. \n\nReasons to bet:\n- I have middle pair, could be best hand\n- Might get folds from weaker holdings\n- Can charge draws\n- Take initiative\n\nReasons to check:\n- Weak kicker makes hand vulnerable\n- Opponent might have a king or better ten\n- Opponent is aggressive and might check-raise\n- I'm out of position for rest of hand\n- Pot is small (20 chips)\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: they're aggressive but also capable of checking. They limped preflop (called 8), which suggests a weak to medium hand. Could be suited connectors, small pairs, or weak broadways.\n\nGiven I'm out of position with a marginal hand, checking seems prudent. I can see what opponent does on the turn. If they bet, I can evaluate then. If they check behind, I get a free card to improve.\n\nMy stack is 30BB, which is decent but not huge. No need to take unnecessary risks with marginal holdings.\n\nI'll check.",

This is a strong hand on this board. Board is 3d Ts Kh 4h. There's a flush draw (hearts) and straight draws possible (any 2 or 5 for a straight, though less likely). \n\nPosition: I'm out of position (BB vs UTG). Opponent just called preflop from UTG, which could indicate a medium-strength hand, maybe suited connectors, small pairs, or Broadway cards.\n\nOpponent tendencies: From the recall, Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown some aggression (raised preflop in hand 52, raised flop in hand 52, bet flop in hand 53). But they also called preflop in hand 54 and folded to a bet on flop. They checked the flop this hand, which suggests weakness or a draw.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 20 chips. If I bet, I could bet 8-16 chips (half to 3/4 pot). Checking is also reasonable to control pot size and see a river card.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 30 BB, which is decent. My two pair is vulnerable to flush draws and straight draws. A heart could complete a flush, and any 2 or 5 could make a straight. I should consider protecting my hand.\n\nDecision: I have two pair, which is strong but vulnerable. I'm out of position. Checking could allow a free card that beats me. Betting could extract value from weaker hands and charge draws. Given the opponent checked flop, they might be weak or have a draw. A small bet (8-12 chips) seems reasonable to charge draws while not committing too much.\n\nActually, looking at the board again: 3d Ts Kh 4h. The flush draw is hearts. I don't have any hearts, so I'm vulnerable to that. There's also potential straight draws with QJ, J9, or A2. A bet protects my hand.\n\nI'll bet small to medium. Let's say 12 chips (60% of pot). That's a reasonable sizing.\n\nWait, but I need to consider that the opponent just called preflop from UTG and checked flop. They might have a hand like KQ, KJ, KT, or a medium pair. They could also have a draw. A bet might fold out weaker hands, but I do want value.\n\nActually, checking might not be terrible either since I'm out of position and could face a raise if I bet. But my hand is strong enough to bet for value and protection.\n\nI'll go with a small bet."

It has almost no potential to make strong hands postflop.\n\n**Position: BTN** - This is the best position at the table, which gives me an advantage postflop. However, with such a weak hand, position alone doesn't justify playing.\n\n**Stack: 257 chips (32.1 BB)** - I have a healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n**Opponent actions:**\n- Seat 4 (SB) posted 4\n- Seat 1 (BB) posted 8  \n- Seat 2 called 8\n\n**Opponent tendencies from memory:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has called preflop with marginal hands like T6s and TT\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been folding a lot preflop but occasionally calls or raises\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been fairly active, calling and raising with various hands\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 8 into a pot of 20 (12 in pot + 8 from my call). That's 2.5:1 odds, or 29% equity needed.\n\n**Hand analysis:** 83o has very low equity against random hands. Even against loose calling ranges, it's unlikely to have 29% equity. The hand has almost no straight or flush potential, and making a pair of 8s or 3s is vulnerable.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 32 BB, I'm not in push/fold territory. I should preserve my stack for better spots. Playing 83o from the button might seem tempting due to position, but it's a hand that will often put me in difficult spots postflop with marginal holdings.\n\n**Decision:** This is an easy fold. The hand is too weak to play, even with position. The pot odds aren't compelling enough given the hand's terrible equity. I should wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"83o is one of the worst starting hands in poker.

Actually, SB called, so SB is first to act preflop? Let's see: Seat 2 is SB, they called. I'm BB. Preflop action: SB posted 4, I posted 8, then others folded, SB called 4 more. So SB completed to 8.

However, I can think generally: SB just called, didn't raise. Could be a weak hand or trapping. With 6s, I'm ahead of many random hands SB might have. Raising could get folds from weak hands. If I raise, minimum raise to 16 (double the current bet of 8). That would be 8 more chips for me (since I already have 8 in). My stack is 249, so raising to 16 is fine.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 31 BB, decent stack. Not too short, not deep. I want to accumulate chips but avoid risky spots.\n\nI think raising is good here with pocket pair. I can either take down the pot preflop or see a flop with a hand that can hit a set. If I hit a set, I can win big. If not, I can often check-fold if overcards come.\n\nLet's raise to 16 (minimum) or maybe larger. Minimum raise to 16 is small, only doubling the pot to 24. Might not get much fold equity. Could raise to 20 or 24. But need to consider stack sizes. SB has 296 chips (37 BB). If I raise to 24 (total), that's 16 more for me. Pot would be 40. That's reasonable.\n\nI'll raise to 24. That's 3x the BB. Standard raise.\n\nNow, need to output JSON.",

Opponent checked to me. I should make a continuation bet. The pot is 48 chips. A bet of around 24-32 chips (1/2 to 2/3 pot) is standard.\n\nI'll bet 28 chips. Since \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount I'm putting in, and I've already put in 24 preflop, I need to calculate the additional amount. Actually wait, let me think about the pot structure.\n\nPreflop: I put in 24 total. Now on the flop, opponent checked. If I want to bet 28 chips into the 48 chip pot, that means I'm adding 28 more chips. But \"raise_to\" should be my total investment this street. Actually no, \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount I'm putting in for the hand, not just this street.\n\nLet me re-read: \"If raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\"\n\nSo currently I've put in 24 chips preflop. If I want to bet 28 chips on the flop, my total investment would be 24 + 28 = 52 chips.\n\nBut wait, that seems high. Let me think about typical betting. In poker, when you bet on the flop, you're adding to your existing investment. So if the pot is 48 and I want to bet 28, I'm putting 28 more chips in. My total investment becomes 24 + 28 = 52.\n\nActually, looking at the instructions again: \"If raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\"\n\nSo if I want to bet 28 chips on the flop, I should set raise_to = 52 (24 preflop + 28 flop).\n\nBut is that correct? Let me check the example from the system. The system says: \"If raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\"\n\nYes, so total for the entire hand, not just this street.\n\nActually, wait. Looking at the preflop action: \"Seat 3 raise 24\" - that was my total preflop raise to 24 chips. So my current total investment is 24 chips.\n\nIf I want to bet 28 chips on the flop, my new total would be 52 chips.\n\nBut let me think if that makes sense. The pot is 48 chips. If I bet 28, opponent would need to call 28 to win 48 + 28 = 76. That's reasonable pot odds.\n\nActually, I should check what \"minimum raise to: 16\" means. That probably means the minimum additional amount I can bet is 16 chips. So I could bet anywhere from 16 to all-in.\n\nI think a bet of 24 chips (making it 1/2 pot) is good. That would make my total investment 24 + 24 = 48 chips.\n\nActually, simpler: I'll bet 24 chips (1/2 pot). So my total investment becomes 24 preflop + 24 flop = 48 chips total.\n\nLet me respond with JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand #60 - FLOP**\n- My position: SB (Seat 3)\n- My cards: 2s 2h (pocket deuces)\n- My stack: 257 chips (32.1 BB)\n- Board: 5c 9d 3c\n- Pot: 72 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (checking is available)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Preflop action:** Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 24, I called 20 from SB, Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 16 from BB.\n\n**Board analysis:** 5c 9d 3c. This is a low, disconnected board. My pocket deuces give me bottom pair. There's a flush draw with two clubs. The board is relatively dry otherwise.\n\n**Hand strength:** I have bottom pair with a weak kicker. However, the board is low, so my 2s might be good if opponents missed. There are some straight draws (4-6, 6-8, A-4), but not many. The flush draw is present.\n\n**Position:** I'm in SB, so I'll act first on future streets. This is a disadvantage.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from history:**\n1. **Kimi-K2 (Seat 2):** From hand #59, they called a raise with something (likely middling hand) and folded to a flop bet. In hand #50, they 3-bet preflop. Seems somewhat aggressive but folds to pressure.\n2. **MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):** From hand #54, they raised preflop with Q3o and bet flop. In hand #52, they called a raise with K4s and bet flop. Seems to play somewhat aggressively postflop.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- Me: 257 chips\n- Kimi-K2: 256 chips  \n- MiniMax-M2: 148 chips (shortest stack)\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 72. If I check, I'm getting infinite odds to see the turn. If I bet and get called, I'm building a pot with a weak hand.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have a decent stack (32 BB). MiniMax-M2 is shorter (18.5 BB). Kimi-K2 has similar stack to me.\n\n**Decision points:**\n1. **Check:** Standard with bottom pair out of position. Allows me to see what opponents do.\n2. **Bet:** Could try to take it down now with a small bet, but risky against two opponents.\n3. **Fold:** Not an option since it's free to check.\n\nGiven I'm out of position with bottom pair on a dry board, checking seems best. I can evaluate turn action. If checked through, I get a free card to potentially improve to a set (2 outs). If someone bets, I can decide based on bet size and opponent tendencies.\n\nThe flush draw is concerning, but betting out of position with bottom pair into two opponents seems overly ambitious. Better to check and see the action.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking with bottom pair 2s out of position on dry board 5c 9d 3c.

Wait, actually I have 257 total stack, I already put in 4 SB preflop, then called 20 more preflop = 24 total invested so far.**\n\n**Position: SB (Seat 3) - I act after Seat 4 (BB) bet and Seat 2 called**\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Bet 40 on flop, has 108 chips total stack (68 left after bet?)\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Called the 40 bet, has 216 chips total stack\n\n**Preflop action:** Seat 2 raised to 24, I called from SB with pocket 2s, BB called.\n\n**Flop: 5c 9d 3c** - This is a relatively dry flop with a flush draw (clubs). My pocket 2s give me a pair of 2s, which is bottom pair. I'm behind any pair higher than 2s, but I have a gutshot straight draw to a wheel (A2345) - need a 4. Also backdoor flush potential if I had clubs, but I don't.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 152 + 40 bet = 192 if I call. Need to call 40 to win 192, giving me ~4.8:1 odds (17% equity needed).\n\n**My equity:** With bottom pair and gutshot, against reasonable ranges:\n- Seat 2 (raiser): Could have overpairs, big cards, maybe suited connectors\n- Seat 4 (better): Could have hit top pair, flush draw, straight draw\n\nAgainst top pair (9x), my equity is poor (~15%). Against overcards (AK, AQ) with club draw, I have ~35%. Against flush draws, I'm ahead (~55%). Against sets, I'm dead.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from recall:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression - bet flop in hand 54, bet turn and river in hand 58. Seems capable of betting draws or made hands.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Seems more passive - called turn bet in hand 58, folded river. Called flop bet here.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 257 chips (32 BB), which is healthy. Seat 4 has only 108 chips (13.5 BB) and is likely playing more aggressively due to short stack.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I have bottom pair with gutshot - marginal hand\n2. Pot odds are decent (4.8:1)\n3. Implied odds: If I hit a 2 (2 outs) or 4 (4 outs for straight), I could win more chips\n4. Reverse implied odds: If I'm already behind to a 9 or overpair, I could lose more chips\n5. Position: I'm out of position for rest of hand\n6. Multiway pot: Two opponents, increases chance someone has a real hand\n\nThe fact that Seat 4 bet 40 into 152 pot (~26% pot) is a moderate bet. Could be testing with a draw or protecting a medium pair. Seat 2's call suggests he has something - maybe a draw or pair.\n\nGiven my stack size and the pot odds, I think calling is reasonable. Folding is too tight given the odds. Raising seems risky with bottom pair out of position against two players.\n\nActually, let me check stack sizes more carefully:\n- Seat 4: Started with 108, bet 40 on flop, has 68 left\n- Seat 2: Started with 216, called 40, has 176 left\n- Me: 257 total, invested 24 preflop, have 233 left\n\nIf I call, pot becomes 232, and effective stacks are:\n- Seat 4: 68 (very short)\n- Seat 2: 176\n- Me: 193 after calling\n\nActually wait, I need to recalculate: My stack is 257 total. I put in 4 SB + 20 call preflop = 24. So I have 233 left. If I call 40 more, I'll have 193 left.\n\nWith Seat 4 so short, he might be committing with any decent hand. If I call and he's all-in on turn, I get to see river cheaply.\n\nI think calling is the best play. It keeps the pot small, allows me to see turn, and I have some equity. Folding gives up too easily given pot odds. Raising blo"

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the SB with pocket 2s. The board is 5c 9d 3c 9h. The turn just came 9h, pairing the board. I have pocket 2s, so I have a small pocket pair with a board of 5-9-3-9. I have a weak hand - just a pair of 2s, which is likely not good here. However, I do have a gutshot straight draw: I need a 4 to make a straight (2-3-4-5). Actually, looking at the board 5c 9d 3c 9h, I have 2s 2h. With a 4, I'd have 2-3-4-5 straight. That's 4 outs (four 4s in the deck). But the board is paired with 9s, so someone could have trips or a full house.\n\nThe pot is 192 chips. I have 217 chips total. The action is on me on the turn, and I can check or raise. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) bet 40 on the flop, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called, and I called. Now it's my turn to act on the turn.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2): From the data, seems like a passive player who checks and calls often. In hand 58, they checked multiple streets and called a small bet on turn. In hand 59, they called preflop raises. They've shown some showdowns with mediocre hands like T6s and TTs.\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2): More aggressive - has raised preflop and bet on flop and turn in previous hands. In hand 58, they bet turn and river with small bets. They have shown a hand with K4s.\n\nThe flop bet of 40 by Seat 4 into a pot of ~72 (24+24+24 preflop) is a significant bet. Both opponents called. The turn brought a 9h, pairing the board. This could be a scare card for someone with a 9, or it could help someone with trips.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 2s is very weak. I'm basically drawing to a 4 for a straight (4 outs) or hitting another 2 for trips (2 outs), but even trips might not be good if someone has a 9. I have 6 clean outs at best.\n\nPot odds: If I check and someone bets, I'll need to consider calling. Currently, the pot is 192. If I face a bet, say 40 again, I'd be getting 192:40 or about 4.8:1 odds. I need about 7:1 odds to chase a 6-outer (about 12.8% chance). So not great pot odds.\n\nHowever, I'm in position relative to the bettor? Actually, I'm SB, Seat 4 is BB, Seat 2 is UTG? Let me check positions: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 is UTG? Actually, positions: Seat 3 is SB (me), Seat 4 is BB, Seat 1 is UTG? Wait, the hand says: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking (folded), Seat 2: Kimi-K2, Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 (me), Seat 4: MiniMax-M2, Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B (folded). So Seat 2 is UTG, I'm SB, Seat 4 is BB. On the turn, action goes: me (SB) first, then Seat 4 (BB), then Seat 2 (UTG). Actually, wait - after the flop, Seat 4 (BB) bet, Seat 2 called, I called. So on the turn, I act first because I'm SB.\n\nGiven that I have a weak hand and I'm out of position (acting first), checking is likely best. If I check and Seat 4 bets again, I'll need to reconsider. But checking seems standard here.\n\nLet me think about raising as a bluff. The board is paired with 9s. If I raise, I could represent a 9 or a full house. But with two opponents who called a flop bet, one of them might have a 9 or a draw. Seat 4's flop bet could be a continuation bet with a wide range, or they could have a real hand. Given my stack size (27 BB), I don't want to commit too many chips with a weak hand.\n\nChecking seems prudent. I can see what Seat 4 does. If they check behind, I get a free river. If they bet, I can evaluate pot odds.\n\n"

          "content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand: #60**\n- My position: SB (Seat 3)\n- My cards: 2s 2h (pocket deuces)\n- My stack: 217 chips (27.1 BB)\n- Board: 5c 9d 3c 9h (turn just dealt)\n- Pot: 312 chips\n- Opponents: \n  - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (96 chips) - just bet 120 on turn\n  - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (108 chips) - checked turn\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Preflop: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 24, I called 20, Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 16\n- Flop: 5c 9d 3c - I checked, Seat 4 bet 40, Seat 2 called 40, I called 40\n- Turn: 9h - I checked, Seat 4 checked, Seat 2 bet 120\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 120 to win 432 (312 + 120). That's 120/432 = 27.8% pot odds.\n\n**My hand analysis:** I have pocket deuces. Board is 5c 9d 3c 9h. I have:\n- No pair on board (deuces are undercards to board)\n- Backdoor straight draw: I need a 4 for wheel straight (A-2-3-4-5)\n- Very weak hand - essentially hoping for a 2 on river for trips\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n1. Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has 96 chips total, just bet 120 (more than his stack? Wait, he started with 96 chips, but bet 120? That seems impossible. Let me check: He had 96 chips preflop, called 40 on flop (56 left), now bets 120? That's an all-in bet then. Actually, he must have 56 chips left and is betting all-in for 56, not 120. But the prompt says \"bet 120\" and \"amount to call: 120\". Let me re-examine: Pot is 312, he bets 120, but he only has 96 total? Something doesn't add up. Maybe I misread stack sizes or there's a discrepancy.)\n\nWait, let me recalculate stacks from beginning:\n- Preflop: Seat 2 started with 96 chips\n- Preflop action: Seat 2 raised to 24 (72 left)\n- Flop: Seat 2 called 40 (32 left)\n- Turn: Seat 2 bets 120? That's impossible with 32 left. Unless the \"bet 120\" is actually an all-in for his remaining 32 chips. But the prompt says \"bet 120\" and \"amount to call: 120\". \n\nActually, looking at the prompt again: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 96 chips\" - that might be his current stack, not starting stack. So he has 96 chips NOW, before the turn bet. That means:\n- Preflop: Started with X chips, raised to 24\n- Flop: Called 40 \n- Turn: Has 96 chips left, bets 120? That's still more than his stack. Unless 120 is the bet size but he's actually all-in for less. The prompt says \"bet 120\" but he might be all-in for his remaining 96.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me assume Kimi-K2 is essentially all-in or near all-in with this bet.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from history:**\n- Kimi-K2: From hand 50, showed aggressive preflop raising with A7o. Hand 51 won with K5o (trips). Hand 59 folded to my flop bet with 66. Generally seems somewhat loose but not hyper-aggressive.\n- MiniMax-M2: From hand 58, bet turn with marginal hand, won with bet on river.\n\n**My situation:** I have 217 chips total. Calling 120 would leave me with 97 chips (12.1 BB). That's a significant portion of my stack.\n\n**Hand strength:** My deuces are basically bluff catchers at best. The board has a pair of 9s, so someone could have a 9 for trips, or an overpair, or a flush draw (two clubs on board). The turn 9h pairs the board, making it less likely someone has a 9 (though still possible).\n\n**Potential draws:** Flush draw with clubs, straight draws (4-6, 6-8, etc.).\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. Pot odds: 27.8% needed\n2. My equity:"

That's 120/432 = 27.8% pot odds.\n\n**My hand analysis:** I have pocket deuces. Board is 5c 9d 3c 9h. I have:\n- No pair on board (deuces are undercards to board)\n- Backdoor straight draw: I need a 4 for wheel straight (A-2-3-4-5)\n- Very weak hand - essentially hoping for a 2 on river for trips\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n1. Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has 96 chips total, just bet 120 (more than his stack? Wait, he started with 96 chips, but bet 120? That seems impossible. Let me check: He had 96 chips preflop, called 40 on flop (56 left), now bets 120? That's an all-in bet then. Actually, he must have 56 chips left and is betting all-in for 56, not 120. But the prompt says \"bet 120\" and \"amount to call: 120\". Let me re-examine: Pot is 312, he bets 120, but he only has 96 total? Something doesn't add up. Maybe I misread stack sizes or there's a discrepancy.)\n\nWait, let me recalculate stacks from beginning:\n- Preflop: Seat 2 started with 96 chips\n- Preflop action: Seat 2 raised to 24 (72 left)\n- Flop: Seat 2 called 40 (32 left)\n- Turn: Seat 2 bets 120? That's impossible with 32 left. Unless the \"bet 120\" is actually an all-in for his remaining 32 chips. But the prompt says \"bet 120\" and \"amount to call: 120\". \n\nActually, looking at the prompt again: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 96 chips\" - that might be his current stack, not starting stack. So he has 96 chips NOW, before the turn bet. That means:\n- Preflop: Started with X chips, raised to 24\n- Flop: Called 40 \n- Turn: Has 96 chips left, bets 120? That's still more than his stack. Unless 120 is the bet size but he's actually all-in for less. The prompt says \"bet 120\" but he might be all-in for his remaining 96.\n\nGiven the confusion, let me assume Kimi-K2 is essentially all-in or near all-in with this bet.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from history:**\n- Kimi-K2: From hand 50, showed aggressive preflop raising with A7o. Hand 51 won with K5o (trips). Hand 59 folded to my flop bet with 66. Generally seems somewhat loose but not hyper-aggressive.\n- MiniMax-M2: From hand 58, bet turn with marginal hand, won with bet on river.\n\n**My situation:** I have 217 chips total. Calling 120 would leave me with 97 chips (12.1 BB). That's a significant portion of my stack.\n\n**Hand strength:** My deuces are basically bluff catchers at best. The board has a pair of 9s, so someone could have a 9 for trips, or an overpair, or a flush draw (two clubs on board). The turn 9h pairs the board, making it less likely someone has a 9 (though still possible).\n\n**Potential draws:** Flush draw with clubs, straight draws (4-6, 6-8, etc.).\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. Pot odds: 27.8% needed\n2. My equity:",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have more information. Let me analyze:\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- Kimi-K2: Seems passive in recent hands - checking and calling mostly, folding to aggression. In hand 59, folded to my flop bet with 66. Not showing much aggression postflop.\n- MiniMax-M2: Has shown some aggression - raised preflop in hand 54, bet turn and river in hand 58. But checked this turn.\n\n**Current hand analysis:**\nBoard: 5c 9d 3c 9h\nMy hand: 2s 2h\n\nI have pocket deuces. The board has a pair of 9s. My hand is very weak - basically hoping for a 2 on river (2 outs, ~4.5% chance). There's a backdoor straight draw if a 4 comes (wheel: A-2-3-4-5), but that's unlikely.\n\n**Pot odds:** Need to call 120 to win 432 (312 + 120) = 27.8% equity needed.\n\n**My equity against likely hands:**\n- If opponent has a 9: I have ~2% equity (only hitting a 2)\n- If opponent has overpair (TT+): I have ~2% equity  \n- If opponent has flush draw: I have ~18% equity\n- If opponent has straight draw: I have ~18% equity\n- If opponent has air/bluff: I'm ahead but vulnerable\n\n**Stack considerations:** I have 217 chips. Calling 120 leaves me with 97 (12.1 BB). That's a significant portion of my stack.\n\n**Opponent betting pattern analysis:**\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Preflop raiser, called flop bet, now bets turn. Given his passive history, this bet looks strong. He might have a 9, an overpair, or a strong draw.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Bet flop, checked turn. Could have a draw, medium pair, or was betting flop for protection.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 27.1 BB, I'm not desperate. Losing 120 chips would leave me with 12.1 BB, which is short but playable. However, calling with such weak equity is questionable.\n\n**Possible scenarios:**\n1. Kimi-K2 has a 9 (trips) - very likely given board paired, he's betting big\n2. Kimi-K2 has overpair (TT-AA) - also likely\n3. Kimi-K2 has flush draw - possible but less likely given passive history\n4. Kimi-K2 has straight draw - possible\n5. Kimi-K2 is bluffing - possible but less likely given passive history\n\nMy equity against trips or overpair is only ~2%. Against a draw, it's ~18%. I need 27.8% equity to break even on pot odds. Even against a draw, I don't have enough equity.\n\n**Additional factor:** There's still MiniMax-M2 to act behind me if I call. He checked turn but could be trapping or have a strong hand.\n\n**Conclusion:** With weak pocket deuces on a paired board, facing a large bet from a player who has shown passive tendencies (making this bet look strong), and needing 27.8% equity when I likely have 2-18% equity at best, this is a clear fold. Preserving my 27.1 BB stack is more important than gambling with poor odds.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket deuces are too weak on 9-9-5-3 board.

From the data, I see they've raised preflop a few times (hands 31, 40, 54), but they're in a desperate spot. They posted SB of 8, so they have 92 left after posting. They might be looking to shove with any decent hand.\n\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has 239 chips (14.9 BB). From the data, they seem to play a mix of hands. In hand 52 they raised from SB with K4s. In hand 57 they raised after a limper. They can be aggressive.\n\nMy hand: KTo offsuit on the button. This is a decent hand in position, especially against short stacks. With 13.6 BB, I'm also somewhat short, but not as desperate as MiniMax-M2.\n\nImportant factors:\n- MiniMax-M2 is extremely short (6.25 BB) and will likely shove with a wide range if they decide to play\n- If I call 16 (1 BB), the pot will be 40, and MiniMax-M2 has 92 behind (5.75 BB)\n- If I raise, I could potentially isolate MiniMax-M2 or get Kimi-K2 Thinking to fold\n- Position is good on the button\n\nGiven the stack sizes:\n- MiniMax-M2 is likely to shove with many hands\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking might call a small raise with a decent hand\n- My KTo is ahead of MiniMax-M2's shoving range\n\nI think raising is the best play here. I want to put pressure on the blinds and potentially win the pot preflop. If MiniMax-M2 shoves, I can call with KTo. If Kimi-K2 Thinking calls, I have position.\n\nA standard raise would be to 40-48 (2.5-3 BB). Since minimum raise is to 32, I'll raise to 48 (3x the BB).\n\nLet me calculate: My stack is 217. Raise to 48 leaves me with 169 behind (10.6 BB). That's reasonable.\n\nIf MiniMax-M2 shoves for 100 total (they have 92 behind after SB of 8), I'd need to call 52 more (100 - 48 = 52). Pot would be: 24 (current) + 48 (my raise) + 100 (their shove) = 172. I'd need to call 52 to win 172, getting 3.3:1 odds. That's a clear call with KTo.\n\nIf Kimi-K2 Thinking calls or raises, I'll have to reassess.\n\nDecision: Raise to 48."

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm on the button with Ks Td, 13.6 BB stack. The small blind (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) has 100 chips (6.25 BB) and is very short. The big blind (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 239 chips (14.9 BB). Seat 2 has folded.\n\nLooking at the opponent tendencies:\n1. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Very short stack (6.25 BB). From the data, I see they've raised preflop a few times (hands 31, 40, 54), but they're in a desperate spot. They posted SB of 8, so they have 92 left after posting. They might be looking to shove with any decent hand.\n\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has 239 chips (14.9 BB). From the data, they seem to play a mix of hands. In hand 52 they raised from SB with K4s. In hand 57 they raised after a limper. They can be aggressive.\n\nMy hand: KTo offsuit on the button. This is a decent hand in position, especially against short stacks. With 13.6 BB, I'm also somewhat short, but not as desperate as MiniMax-M2.\n\nImportant factors:\n- MiniMax-M2 is extremely short (6.25 BB) and will likely shove with a wide range if they decide to play\n- If I call 16 (1 BB), the pot will be 40, and MiniMax-M2 has 92 behind (5.75 BB)\n- If I raise, I could potentially isolate MiniMax-M2 or get Kimi-K2 Thinking to fold\n- Position is good on the button\n\nGiven the stack sizes:\n- MiniMax-M2 is likely to shove with many hands\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking might call a small raise with a decent hand\n- My KTo is ahead of MiniMax-M2's shoving range\n\nI think raising is the best play here. I want to put pressure on the blinds and potentially win the pot preflop. If MiniMax-M2 shoves, I can call with KTo. If Kimi-K2 Thinking calls, I have position.\n\nA standard raise would be to 40-48 (2.5-3 BB). Since minimum raise is to 32, I'll raise to 48 (3x the BB).\n\nLet me calculate: My stack is 217. Raise to 48 leaves me with 169 behind (10.6 BB). That's reasonable.\n\nIf MiniMax-M2 shoves for 100 total (they have 92 behind after SB of 8), I'd need to call 52 more (100 - 48 = 52). Pot would be: 24 (current) + 48 (my raise) + 100 (their shove) = 172. I'd need to call 52 to win 172, getting 3.3:1 odds. That's a clear call with KTo.\n\nIf Kimi-K2 Thinking calls or raises, I'll have to reassess.\n\nDecision: Raise to 48.",

Their showdown hands include weak pairs and suited connectors.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop 10 times, also aggressive. Showdown hands include Ts6s and pocket tens.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised 3 times, less aggressive. Showdown shows K4o.\n\nMy own history: I've been playing reasonably tight. I won the last hand with KTo from BTN with a raise.\n\nGiven my position (UTG) with a terrible hand (4d 8h), I should fold. This is an easy fold from early position with such weak cards. I have 15.1 BB, which is short but not desperate yet. There are still players to act behind me (Seat 4 and the button is empty since Seat 5 folded). Calling or raising with 84o from UTG would be terrible poker.\n\nThe pot is 24, I need to call 16. Even if I call, I'll be out of position against potentially multiple players. The hand has almost no potential - not suited, not connected, low cards. Even if I flop a pair, it's likely dominated.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 15.1 BB, which is short but I can wait for a better spot. Folding preserves my stack for a better opportunity.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors. Looking at the showdown hands of opponents, they sometimes play weak hands too, but that doesn't justify playing 84o from UTG.\n\nDecision: Fold."

Blinds are 8/16. Seat 1 (SB) posted 8, Seat 2 (BB) posted 16. I need to act first.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop 8 times in 61 hands, showing some aggression. Their showdown hands include weak pairs and suited connectors.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop 10 times, also aggressive. Showdown hands include Ts6s and pocket tens.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised 3 times, less aggressive. Showdown shows K4o.\n\nMy own history: I've been playing reasonably tight. I won the last hand with KTo from BTN with a raise.\n\nGiven my position (UTG) with a terrible hand (4d 8h), I should fold. This is an easy fold from early position with such weak cards. I have 15.1 BB, which is short but not desperate yet. There are still players to act behind me (Seat 4 and the button is empty since Seat 5 folded). Calling or raising with 84o from UTG would be terrible poker.\n\nThe pot is 24, I need to call 16. Even if I call, I'll be out of position against potentially multiple players. The hand has almost no potential - not suited, not connected, low cards. Even if I flop a pair, it's likely dominated.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 15.1 BB, which is short but I can wait for a better spot. Folding preserves my stack for a better opportunity.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors. Looking at the showdown hands of opponents, they sometimes play weak hands too, but that doesn't justify playing 84o from UTG.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Pot odds are favorable (3:1), but hand has poor equity and playability. Opponent (6.75 BB) may defend/shove wide. Better to preserve 15.1 BB stack for better spots.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the button with 3d Td. My stack is 241 chips (15.1 BB). Blinds are 8/16. I've posted the small blind (8 chips). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted the big blind (16 chips). Seats 1 and 2 folded. So it's just me and the big blind.\n\nI need to call 8 more chips to see the flop (total 16 including my SB). The pot is currently 24 chips (8 SB + 16 BB).\n\nLooking at opponent data: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 108 chips (6.75 BB). They're the big blind. From the opponent data, I can see:\n- They've been fairly active preflop, with a mix of folds, calls, and raises\n- In hand #62, they raised to 32 preflop\n- In hand #60, they called 16 preflop from the BB\n- In hand #58, they called 8 preflop (likely from SB)\n\nMy hand: 3d Td is not great. Ten-three suited is a weak hand. However, I'm on the button against just the big blind, which gives me position advantage. The opponent has a short stack (108 chips, 6.75 BB) which might make them more likely to defend their blind with a wide range.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 chips to win 24 chips, which is 3:1 pot odds (25% equity needed). With T3s, I probably have around 35-40% equity against a random hand, so pot odds are favorable.\n\nHowever, I have position and can potentially steal the blinds with a raise. The minimum raise is to 32 (total). My stack is 241, so I could raise. But T3s is a weak hand to raise with, even on the button against a short stack.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 15.1 BB, which is short but not critical. The opponent has only 6.75 BB, which is very short. They might be desperate and call/shove with a wide range.\n\nGiven the opponent's short stack and my position, I think the best play is to fold. T3s is just too weak, even with position. The 8 chips to call is small, but I'd be putting money in with a very weak hand out of position on the flop (well, actually I have position, but still weak hand).\n\nActually wait - I'm on the button, so I have position post-flop. But still, T3s is very weak. The suited aspect gives some flush potential, but it's a low flush.\n\nLet me think about raising: If I raise to 32 (2x BB over the 16), that's a standard raise. The opponent has 108 total, so they'd need to call 16 more (from their 16 BB to 32). They might defend with a wide range given their short stack. If they shove, I'd have to call 209 more to win ~140 total pot (24 + 108 + 32?). Actually if they shove for 108 total, I'd have to call 76 more (108 - 32 I already put in). That would be a tough spot with T3s.\n\nBetter to just fold and preserve my stack. 8 chips is only 0.5 BB, but it's still 3.3% of my stack. Not worth it with such a weak hand.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

It's my action.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB): Has folded 9 out of last 10 hands preflop, only raised once (hand 57). Seems tight/passive.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB): Has shown some aggression - raised preflop in hand 62, called in hand 60 and bet postflop. Might defend SB with wider range.\n\nMy hand: 9\u2660 7\u2663 is a weak offsuit connector. From button position, I could consider playing speculative hands, but with only 15 BB, stack preservation is important. However, button is the best position, and both opponents behind have shown tendency to fold preflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 16 to win pot of 24. That's 1:1.5 odds (need 40% equity). 97o likely has less than 40% equity against random hands, but against tight opponents who might fold often, I could consider stealing.\n\nTournament considerations: With 15 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate. I should look for better spots. However, button is a good stealing position.\n\nAlternative: I could raise to steal. Minimum raise to 32 (double the BB). That's 32 chips out of my 241 stack (13%). If successful, I win 24 chips uncontested. If called, I'm out of position with a weak hand.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's stack: 124 chips (7.75 BB) - very short. He might be desperate and call/shove wider. Kimi-K2 Thinking has 215 chips (13.4 BB) - also somewhat short.\n\nGiven my hand strength is poor, and both opponents are somewhat short-stacked (especially MiniMax-M2), they might be more likely to call/shove. 97o doesn't play well against shoving ranges.\n\nI think the best play is to fold. Wait for a better spot. My position is good, but the hand is too weak to invest chips with a short stack. Let me check if I've been playing too tight recently. Looking at my last few hands: I won hand 61 with K\u2660 T\u2666 from button with a raise, won hand 63 from BB with J\u2663 2\u2663 (just checked), folded other marginal hands.

My stack is 241 chips (15.1 BB), which is short but not critically short. The blinds are 8/16.\n\nLooking at opponent actions:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): In hand #65, they raised preflop from SB to 32 (2x BB raise) with 8 BB already posted. Shows some aggression.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has folded preflop in recent hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Called a raise in hand #65, then bet on turn.\n\nMy position is UTG, which is the worst position at the table. With QJo, I'm likely to be dominated by better hands from later positions. This hand doesn't play well multi-way and is vulnerable to raises behind me.\n\nGiven my short stack (15.1 BB), I need to be careful about committing chips with marginal hands. However, I could consider raising to steal the blinds, but from UTG with this hand, that's risky with 3 players left to act.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 16 to win 24 (current pot). That's 1.5:1 odds, but the hand is weak.\n\nTournament considerations: With 15.1 BB, I'm not in push/fold territory yet, but getting close. I should wait for better spots.\n\nBetter to fold QJo from UTG with a short stack. I can find better opportunities in later positions or with stronger hands.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"QJo offsuit is too weak from UTG with 15.1 BB.

          "content": "Let me analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with pocket Jacks (Js Jd). My stack is 225 chips (14.1 BB). The opponent in seat 2 (SB) raised to 48 total (32 more for me to call). The pot is currently 64 chips (16 from blinds + 48 from opponent).\n\nLooking at opponent's history: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop 14 times. Their raise amounts vary: 6, 8, 12, 24, 60, 164. The most recent raises were 24 chips (hands 56 and 60). In hand 50, they raised to 60 then reraised to 164 all-in.\n\nThe current raise to 48 is larger than their typical 24-chip raises but not huge. This could indicate a stronger hand than their usual opening range.\n\nMy hand: Pocket Jacks is a strong hand but vulnerable. It's ahead of most unpaired hands but behind QQ, KK, AA. At 14.1 BB effective stack, I need to consider my options:\n\n1. **Fold**: Too weak for JJ with these stack sizes\n2. **Call**: Put in 32 more (total 48) to see a flop with 225 stack\n3. **Raise**: Minimum raise to 80, could go bigger\n\nPot odds: I need to call 32 to win 96 (64 current pot + 32 my call). That's 1:3 pot odds, requiring ~25% equity.\n\nWith JJ against a typical SB opening range, I have well over 25% equity. Even against a tighter range, JJ has good equity.\n\nStack sizes: I have 225, opponent has 344. If I raise to say 80, I'd have 145 left (9 BB) with pot of ~144. This would commit me.\n\nGiven my stack size (14.1 BB), JJ is definitely a raise/call hand. I should 3-bet. Looking at typical tournament strategy with 14 BB: JJ is a premium hand that should be played aggressively.\n\nIf I raise to 80 (minimum), opponent might call or shove. If they shove, I'd have to call 145 more into pot of ~369 (80+80+225ish). That would be about 2:1 pot odds, requiring ~33% equity. JJ vs a shoving range (probably QQ+, AK, maybe AQ) would have around 40% equity against QQ+/AK, so it's a call.\n\nActually, let me think: At 14 BB, standard play is to shove or raise/call with JJ. Raising to 80 leaves me with 9 BB, which is awkward if I miss the flop.\n\nAlternative: Go all-in now (225 total). This puts maximum pressure and avoids post-flop decisions. With JJ and 14 BB, a shove is reasonable.\n\nBut opponent has me covered (344 vs 225). If I shove and they call with a better hand, I'm out.\n\nGiven opponent's raising history seems somewhat loose (many small raises), they might not have a monster. Their 48 raise is larger than usual though.\n\nLet me check if there are any showdowns with this opponent to see their ranges. From the recall data, I see two showdowns: hand 30 they had Ts6s (weak), hand 50 they had ThTs (pocket tens). So they do play pocket pairs.\n\nDecision: With 14 BB and JJ in the BB facing a SB raise, I should 3-bet. A shove of 225 might get folds from many hands. But if I raise smaller to 80, I keep some fold equity and can get away if an A, K, Q flops.\n\nActually, with 225 stack and pot of 64, a raise to 80 commits 64 more (total 80). Then I have 145 left. The pot would be 144. If opponent calls, pot is 160, and I have 145 behind (less than pot). This is essentially committed.\n\nSo raising to 80 is almost committing myself. Better to shove or call.\n\nCalling is also an option: see a flop with position (they act first post-flop). But with JJ and such a short stack, I want to get it in preflop or on safe flops.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 14.1 BB, which is short but not desperate. Double-up would give me 28 BB. A loss would eliminate me.\n\nI think the best play is to shove. JJ is too strong to fold, and raising small creates awkward post-flop play. Shove maximizes fold equity and gets value from worse hands that might call (TT, 99, AQ, AK).\n\nLet me calculate: If I shove to 225, opponent has to call 177 more"

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with pocket Jacks (Js Jd). My stack is 225 chips (14.1 BB). The opponent in seat 2 (SB) raised to 48 total (32 more for me to call). The pot is currently 64 chips (16 from blinds + 48 from opponent).\n\nLooking at opponent's history: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop 14 times. Their raise amounts vary: 6, 8, 12, 24, 60, 164. The most recent raises were 24 chips (hands 56 and 60). In hand 50, they raised to 60 then reraised to 164 all-in.\n\nThe current raise to 48 is larger than their typical 24-chip raises but not huge. This could indicate a stronger hand than their usual opening range.\n\nMy hand: Pocket Jacks is a strong hand but vulnerable. It's ahead of most unpaired hands but behind QQ, KK, AA. At 14.1 BB effective stack, I need to consider my options:\n\n1. **Fold**: Too weak for JJ with these stack sizes\n2. **Call**: Put in 32 more (total 48) to see a flop with 225 stack\n3. **Raise**: Minimum raise to 80, could go bigger\n\nPot odds: I need to call 32 to win 96 (64 current pot + 32 my call). That's 1:3 pot odds, requiring ~25% equity.\n\nWith JJ against a typical SB opening range, I have well over 25% equity. Even against a tighter range, JJ has good equity.\n\nStack sizes: I have 225, opponent has 344. If I raise to say 80, I'd have 145 left (9 BB) with pot of ~144. This would commit me.\n\nGiven my stack size (14.1 BB), JJ is definitely a raise/call hand. I should 3-bet. Looking at typical tournament strategy with 14 BB: JJ is a premium hand that should be played aggressively.\n\nIf I raise to 80 (minimum), opponent might call or shove. If they shove, I'd have to call 145 more into pot of ~369 (80+80+225ish). That would be about 2:1 pot odds, requiring ~33% equity. JJ vs a shoving range (probably QQ+, AK, maybe AQ) would have around 40% equity against QQ+/AK, so it's a call.\n\nActually, let me think: At 14 BB, standard play is to shove or raise/call with JJ. Raising to 80 leaves me with 9 BB, which is awkward if I miss the flop.\n\nAlternative: Go all-in now (225 total). This puts maximum pressure and avoids post-flop decisions. With JJ and 14 BB, a shove is reasonable.\n\nBut opponent has me covered (344 vs 225). If I shove and they call with a better hand, I'm out.\n\nGiven opponent's raising history seems somewhat loose (many small raises), they might not have a monster. Their 48 raise is larger than usual though.\n\nLet me check if there are any showdowns with this opponent to see their ranges. From the recall data, I see two showdowns: hand 30 they had Ts6s (weak), hand 50 they had ThTs (pocket tens). So they do play pocket pairs.\n\nDecision: With 14 BB and JJ in the BB facing a SB raise, I should 3-bet. A shove of 225 might get folds from many hands. But if I raise smaller to 80, I keep some fold equity and can get away if an A, K, Q flops.\n\nActually, with 225 stack and pot of 64, a raise to 80 commits 64 more (total 80). Then I have 145 left. The pot would be 144. If opponent calls, pot is 160, and I have 145 behind (less than pot). This is essentially committed.\n\nSo raising to 80 is almost committing myself. Better to shove or call.\n\nCalling is also an option: see a flop with position (they act first post-flop). But with JJ and such a short stack, I want to get it in preflop or on safe flops.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 14.1 BB, which is short but not desperate. Double-up would give me 28 BB. A loss would eliminate me.\n\nI think the best play is to shove. JJ is too strong to fold, and raising small creates awkward post-flop play. Shove maximizes fold equity and gets value from worse hands that might call (TT, 99, AQ, AK).\n\nLet me calculate: If I shove to 225, opponent has to call 177 more",

I have 16 chips left. I have pocket jacks. The flop has a King, which is concerning. Opponent raised preflop, then called my 3-bet (which was 225 total? Let's see: preflop actions: SB posted 8, I posted BB 16, then Seat 2 raised to 48 total? Actually \"raise 48\" from SB? Wait, Seat 2 is SB? Actually seat numbering: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking (folded), Seat 2: Kimi-K2, Seat 3: me, Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (folded), Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B (folded). So Seat 2 is the SB? Actually blinds: 8/16. Seat 2 posted SB 8, I posted BB 16. Then Seat 2 raised 48 total? The description: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 48\". That means he raised to 48 total (adding 40 to his 8). Then I raised to 225 total (adding 209 to my 16). Then Seat 2 called 177 more (225 - 48 = 177). So I'm all-in essentially? My stack is 16 chips now, but I already put in 225? Wait, my stack is 16 chips. That's after posting BB? Actually my stack is 16 chips. I posted BB 16, so I started with 32? Let's think: My stack is 16 chips. I posted BB 16, so I had 32 before posting. Then I raised to 225 total, which would require 209 more. But I only had 16 left after posting BB? That doesn't make sense. Let's recalc: If my stack is 16 chips now, after posting BB 16, I must have had 32. Then I raised to 225 total, which would be 209 more, but I only had 16 left? Actually I had 16 after posting BB? Wait, the stack displayed is current stack. At start of hand, I had 32 chips. I posted BB 16, leaving 16. Then I raised to 225 total, which would require 209 more, but I only have 16 left. That means I went all-in for my remaining 16. So my raise to 225 was actually all-in for my total stack of 32? Let's see: I posted BB 16, leaving 16. Then I raised to 225 total, but I can only raise to my stack size. So the raise should have been to 32 total (all-in). But the log says \"raise 225\". That seems odd. Maybe the raise amount is the additional amount, not total? Let's check typical notation: In hand histories, \"raise 48\" usually means raise by 48, not to 48. But they said \"raise 48\" after posting SB 8. That would make total 56? Actually SB posts 8, then raises 48 more, total 56. But then I raise 225 more? Let's assume \"raise 48\" means raise to 48 total. That seems more plausible. Then I raise to 225 total. Then opponent calls 177 more. That means opponent put in 225 total. I put in 225 total. Pot is 450 (225+225). My stack now is 16? That doesn't add up. If I put in 225 total, and started with 32, I'd be all-in and have 0 left. But I have 16 left. Something is off.\n\nMaybe the stacks are after posting blinds but before actions? Actually my stack is 16 chips (1.0 BB). That's my current stack after posting BB? Actually after posting BB, my stack would be reduced by 16. If I started with 32, after posting BB I'd have 16. That matches. So I have 16 left. Then I raised all-in for my remaining 16. So my total contribution is 32. Opponent raised to 48 total, then I raised all-in to 32 total? Wait, that's less than his raise. That can't be. Let's examine: SB posted 8, I posted 16. SB raised to 48 total (added 40). Then I raised to 225 total? That's huge relative to my stack. I think the notation might be different: \"raise 48\" could mean raise by 48, making total 56.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand #67 - Turn**\n- My cards: Js Jd (pocket jacks)\n- Board: Kd 6c 3c 9d\n- My stack: 16 chips (1.0 BB)\n- Pot: 450 chips\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) with 167 chips\n- Action: Opponent checked to me on the turn\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check\n\nKey observations:\n1. I'm in the BB with pocket jacks\n2. Preflop action: Seat 2 (SB) raised to 48, I shoved all-in for 225 (my whole stack was 241 at that time?), wait let me recalculate\n\nWait, there's something off. Let me reconstruct the preflop action:\n- Seat 2 (SB) posted 8\n- I (BB) posted 16  \n- Seat 4 folded\n- Seat 1 folded\n- Seat 2 raised to 48 (so added 40 more)\n- I raised to 225 (all-in for my stack)\n\nBut my current stack is 16 chips, which suggests I have 16 chips left after the preflop action? Actually, if I had 241 chips preflop and raised to 225, I'd have 16 left. That makes sense.\n\nBut the pot is 450 chips. Let me calculate:\n- My initial BB: 16\n- Seat 2's initial SB: 8\n- Seat 2's raise to 48: added 40\n- My raise to 225: added 209 (225 - 16)\n- Seat 2 called 177 more (225 - 48)\nTotal pot: 16 + 8 + 40 + 209 + 177 = 450 \u2713\n\nSo I have 16 chips left, which is exactly 1 BB. The board is Kd 6c 3c 9d. I have pocket jacks. The opponent checked to me on the turn.\n\nMy hand: JJ on Kd 6c 3c 9d board. This is a marginal spot. The king on the board is bad for my jacks. Opponent could have:\n- AK, KQ, KJ, KT (would have called my preflop shove)\n- AA, KK, QQ (would have called)\n- Pairs like TT, 99, 88, etc.\n- Possibly some flush draws with clubs or diamonds\n\nThe opponent checked the turn after checking the flop. This could mean:\n1. They have a marginal hand and are checking to control pot size\n2. They have a draw and are checking to see a free river\n3. They have a monster and are trapping\n\nGiven the pot is 450 and I only have 16 chips left (3.5% of the pot), I'm essentially all-in already. Any bet I make would be my last 16 chips.\n\nWith only 16 chips left, I should consider:\n- If I check, we see a free river\n- If I bet, I'm committing my last chips\n\nMy hand strength: JJ on K-high board. I'm likely behind any hand with a K, but could be ahead of smaller pairs or draws. The opponent's preflop call of my shove suggests a decent hand.\n\nGiven I have only 16 chips (1 BB) and the pot is 450, I'm getting incredible pot odds on any river. I should just check and see the river for free. If I'm ahead, I want to see if a scare card comes. If I'm behind, I don't want to put more money in.\n\nActually, wait - I only have \"fold\" or \"check\" as legal actions. I can't bet. So my only options are to check or fold. Folding would be terrible - I'd give up my chance to win a 450 pot with 16 chips invested.\n\nDecision: Check. See the river for free, hope to improve or that my jacks are good.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Only 16 chips remaining (1 BB) with 450 pot.

Given infinite pot odds (free to check), must see if Jacks are good.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully.\n\nI'm in the BB with Js Jd. My stack is 16 chips (1 BB). The board is Kd 6c 3c 9d 8s. The pot is 450 chips. Opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 167 chips and just checked the river.\n\nLooking at the hand history:\n- Preflop: I posted BB 16, opponent raised to 48, I re-raised to 225 (which was effectively all-in since I only have 16 chips total? Wait, that doesn't make sense... Let me think: If I have 16 chips total, how could I raise to 225? This must be a tournament where I have 16 chips remaining, but the preflop action shows I raised to 225. That seems impossible unless... maybe the stack display is wrong or this is a different format.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes: I have 16 chips, opponent has 167, and I raised to 225 preflop. That's mathematically impossible. Unless... maybe the 16 chips is what I have left after posting the blind? No, that still doesn't add up.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding: \"Your Stack: 16 chips (1.0 BB)\" - but I posted BB of 16, so maybe I started with 32? Or perhaps the display shows my remaining stack after posting? Let me check the preflop action again: \"Seat 3 post_bb 16\" and then \"Seat 3 raise 225\". If I only had 16 total, I couldn't raise to 225.\n\nThis suggests I actually have more chips than displayed, or there's an error. But regardless, the river decision: opponent checked, amount to call is 0, legal actions are fold or check.\n\nGiven that opponent checked the river on a board of Kd 6c 3c 9d 8s, with my pocket Jacks:\n- Board has a King high, which likely hit opponent's raising range\n- There are straight draws (7T for straight, but board shows 6-8-9, so T7 would make a straight, but that's less likely)\n- There are flush draws (clubs and diamonds)\n- My hand is essentially a pair of Jacks, which might be good if opponent has missed draws or smaller pairs\n\nBut opponent called my preflop 3-bet (which was large), then checked flop, turn, and river. This suggests either:\n1. They have a weak hand that missed (like AQ, AJ, TT, etc.)\n2. They have a medium strength hand and are playing cautiously\n3. They have a monster and are trapping (less likely since they checked all streets)\n\nGiven the pot is 450 chips and I have only 16 chips (if that's accurate), this is a huge pot relative to my stack. I should check and see a showdown. Folding would be terrible since it's free to check.\n\nBut wait, I need to understand my actual chip situation. If I only have 16 chips, I'm essentially all-in already. The fact that I can check suggests I still have chips behind? Or maybe the \"fold\" option is available because technically I could fold, but that would be absurd.\n\nActually, looking at the river action: \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check\". This means I can either check (showdown) or fold (forfeit). Since it costs nothing to check, I should absolutely check and see if my Jacks are good.\n\nLet me think about opponent's range: They raised preflop, called a 3-bet, then checked three streets. Their range could include: AK, KQ, KJ, KT, maybe QQ, maybe missed flush draws. My Jacks might be good against some of these.\n\nGiven the pot odds (infinite, since it's free to check), I must check.\n\nBut there's one more consideration: If I'm actually all-in (which seems likely given my small stack), then checking is automatic. The interface is just showing me the option to check for showdown.\n\nI'll check.",

So I have 0 chips left after posting. Actually wait, my stack is 8 chips total, and I posted 8 as SB, so I have 0 chips behind. But the amount to call is 40? That doesn't make sense - if I only have 8 chips total, I can't call 40.\n\nLet me re-examine: \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 8\". So I have 8 chips total, I post 8 as SB, leaving me with 0. But then \"Amount to call: 40\" - this must mean I need to call an additional 40, but I only have 0 chips. This seems like an all-in situation where my 8 chips is already in as the SB.\n\nActually, I think the confusion is: my stack is 8 chips, I posted SB of 8, so I'm all-in with my 8 chips. The raise to 48 by seat 2 means the total bet is 48. Since I only have 8 total, I can only call with my remaining 0 chips? Or maybe the 8 chips is what I have AFTER posting SB?\n\nWait, let me think: \"Your Stack: 8 chips\" likely means current stack size. Then \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 8\" - so I post 8 from my stack, leaving me with 0. The pot is 72: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 48 = 72. Actually SB 8 + BB 16 = 24, plus raise 48 = 72.\n\nI have 9h Td, which is not a great hand, but I'm effectively all-in with 8 chips (0.5 BB). With such a short stack, I should probably call since I'm getting good pot odds. The pot is 72 and it costs me 0 more to call (since I'm already all-in with my 8).\n\nActually, if I'm already all-in with my 8, then \"call\" would mean matching the bet, but I can't match 48 with only 8. In poker, when you're all-in for less than a full bet, you can only win the portion of the pot that you contributed to. So I should call since I'm already all-in.\n\nBut the interface says \"Amount to call: 40\" and \"Legal actions: fold, call\". If I fold, I forfeit my 8 chips. If I call, I put in 40 more, but I only have 8 total. This doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe the 8 chips is what I have BEFORE posting SB? So I have 8 chips, post SB of 8, leaving me with 0. Then \"Amount to call: 40\" means I need to call 40 more, but I have 0. This is confusing.\n\nLet me check: In poker, when you're in the SB and face a raise, you need to call the difference between the raise and your SB.

The pot odds are enormous: I'm putting in 0 more to potentially win 72.\n\nActually, let me calculate: If I call, I put in 0 more (since I'm already all-in). The pot is 72. If I win, I get 72.

I'm essentially in push-or-fold territory.\n\n2. **Position**: Button is great, but with only 2 BB, position matters less.\n\n3. **Hand strength**: AJo is a strong hand, especially for a 2 BB stack. It's well above the shoving range for this stack depth.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, 175 chips) - Has shown both calling and raising tendencies preflop. Has raised to 32 in recent hands.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB, 140 chips) - Just posted SB, has been folding a lot recently but called twice and raised once in recent history.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 24 chips, I need to call 16. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, which is good. If I shove for 32 total, I'm risking 16 more chips to win 40 total (24 current + 16 BB call).\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With only 2 BB, I need to double up soon. This is likely one of my last chances to play a hand with decent equity.\n\n7. **Action considerations**: \n   - Fold: Not great with AJo and 2 BB\n   - Call: Not ideal either - just calling leaves me with 16 chips (1 BB) and out of position postflop\n   - Raise/shove: Best option - I can go all-in for 32 total (which is just a min-raise from the current bet)\n\nGiven my stack size, AJo is a clear shove. Even if the BB has a strong hand, I have decent equity. The SB has been folding a lot recently, so they might fold. The BB might call with a wider range given the pot odds they'll be getting.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise: it says minimum raise to 32. That means if I raise to 32 total, I'm going all-in (since my stack is 32). That's perfect.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations.

I'm essentially in push-or-fold territory.\n\n2. **Position**: Button is great, but with only 2 BB, position matters less.\n\n3. **Hand strength**: AJo is a strong hand, especially for a 2 BB stack. It's well above the shoving range for this stack depth.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, 175 chips) - Has shown both calling and raising tendencies preflop. Has raised to 32 in recent hands.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB, 140 chips) - Just posted SB, has been folding a lot recently but called twice and raised once in recent history.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 24 chips, I need to call 16. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, which is good. If I shove for 32 total, I'm risking 16 more chips to win 40 total (24 current + 16 BB call).\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With only 2 BB, I need to double up soon. This is likely one of my last chances to play a hand with decent equity.\n\n7. **Action considerations**: \n   - Fold: Not great with AJo and 2 BB\n   - Call: Not ideal either - just calling leaves me with 16 chips (1 BB) and out of position postflop\n   - Raise/shove: Best option - I can go all-in for 32 total (which is just a min-raise from the current bet)\n\nGiven my stack size, AJo is a clear shove. Even if the BB has a strong hand, I have decent equity. The SB has been folding a lot recently, so they might fold. The BB might call with a wider range given the pot odds they'll be getting.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise: it says minimum raise to 32. That means if I raise to 32 total, I'm going all-in (since my stack is 32). That's perfect.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations.

Hand: A3o - Ace-rag offsuit. Not a great hand, but I have an Ace. \n2. Stack size: 56 chips (3.5 BB). I'm in push-or-fold territory.\n3. Position: UTG - worst position, with 3 players behind me (SB, BB, and MiniMax-M2 in CO? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, seat 5 is folded).\n4. Opponents: \n   - Seat 1 (SB): Kimi-K2 Thinking (167 chips) - seems fairly tight based on recent folds\n   - Seat 2 (BB): Kimi-K2 (585 chips) - has shown some aggression with raises (hand 67, 68)\n   - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (140 chips) - haven't seen much data\n\nWith only 3.5 BB, I should be looking for any decent spot to go all-in. A3o is marginal but might be the best hand I see for a while. The blinds are 8/16, so I'm posting 16 next hand if I fold (I'm UTG, next hand will be in different position though).\n\nIf I call 16, I'll have 40 left (2.5 BB). That's still very short. If I raise all-in to 56, I'm risking my tournament life.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 2 (BB) has shown willingness to call with decent hands (called a big raise with 66 in hand 67). Seat 1 (SB) seems tight.\n\nGiven my stack size, I think I need to be aggressive. A3o is not great, but with 3.5 BB, I can't wait for premium hands. The alternative is folding and hoping for a better spot, but I'll be down to effectively 2.5 BB after posting next blind.\n\nI should consider going all-in. The pot is 24, and if I go all-in for 56, I'm offering 1.75:1 pot odds to callers. They need ~36% equity to call. A3o has ~40% equity against a random hand, but worse against calling ranges.\n\nActually, let me think: If I go all-in, the SB (16 to call 40 more) and BB (0 to call 40 more) get decent odds. But they might fold marginal hands.\n\nGiven tournament survival, maybe I should fold and wait for a better spot? But with 3.5 BB, any spot might be my last.\n\nActually, I just won hand 69 with AJo from BTN with a raise. So I have some momentum.\n\nI think with A3o UTG and such a short stack, it's a push. I'm likely to get called by better aces or pairs, but I have some fold equity.\n\nLet me check if there are antes? No, just blinds.\n\nI'll go all-in."

Hand: A3o - Ace-rag offsuit. Not a great hand, but I have an Ace. \n2. Stack size: 56 chips (3.5 BB). I'm in push-or-fold territory.\n3. Position: UTG - worst position, with 3 players behind me (SB, BB, and MiniMax-M2 in CO? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, seat 5 is folded).\n4. Opponents: \n   - Seat 1 (SB): Kimi-K2 Thinking (167 chips) - seems fairly tight based on recent folds\n   - Seat 2 (BB): Kimi-K2 (585 chips) - has shown some aggression with raises (hand 67, 68)\n   - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (140 chips) - haven't seen much data\n\nWith only 3.5 BB, I should be looking for any decent spot to go all-in. A3o is marginal but might be the best hand I see for a while. The blinds are 8/16, so I'm posting 16 next hand if I fold (I'm UTG, next hand will be in different position though).\n\nIf I call 16, I'll have 40 left (2.5 BB). That's still very short. If I raise all-in to 56, I'm risking my tournament life.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 2 (BB) has shown willingness to call with decent hands (called a big raise with 66 in hand 67). Seat 1 (SB) seems tight.\n\nGiven my stack size, I think I need to be aggressive. A3o is not great, but with 3.5 BB, I can't wait for premium hands. The alternative is folding and hoping for a better spot, but I'll be down to effectively 2.5 BB after posting next blind.\n\nI should consider going all-in. The pot is 24, and if I go all-in for 56, I'm offering 1.75:1 pot odds to callers. They need ~36% equity to call. A3o has ~40% equity against a random hand, but worse against calling ranges.\n\nActually, let me think: If I go all-in, the SB (16 to call 40 more) and BB (0 to call 40 more) get decent odds. But they might fold marginal hands.\n\nGiven tournament survival, maybe I should fold and wait for a better spot? But with 3.5 BB, any spot might be my last.\n\nActually, I just won hand 69 with AJo from BTN with a raise. So I have some momentum.\n\nI think with A3o UTG and such a short stack, it's a push. I'm likely to get called by better aces or pairs, but I have some fold equity.\n\nLet me check if there are antes? No, just blinds.\n\nI'll go all-in.",

          "content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with Td7d (ten-seven suited diamonds). My stack is 64 chips (4 BB). Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 48 total after posting SB 8. So the raise amount is 48 total, meaning I need to call 32 more (since I already have 16 in as BB). Pot is currently: SB 8 + my BB 16 + raise 48 = 72? Wait, let's calculate: SB posted 8, I posted 16, then Seat 2 raised to 48 total. That means he put in 48 total, which includes his SB 8, so additional 40. The pot is: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise additional 40 = 64 chips. Actually the display says \"Pot: 64 chips\". Yes.\n\nI have 64 chips total, with 16 already in, so I have 48 left. To call, I need to put in 32 more, leaving me with 16 behind. If I raise, minimum raise to 80 total (I think that means total chips put in). Since I have only 64 total, I can only raise all-in to 64 total, which would be a raise of 16 more? Wait: I have 64 total, with 16 already in, so I have 48 left. If I raise all-in to 64 total, that's an additional 48. But the minimum raise to is 80, which I cannot meet because I only have 64 total. So I can only call or fold, or go all-in for 64 total, which is a raise but less than min-raise? In No-Limit, you can always go all-in even if it's less than a min-raise. So \"raise\" is a legal action, meaning I can go all-in.\n\nSo options: fold, call 32, or raise all-in to 64 total.\n\nNow, hand strength: T7s is a speculative hand. Suited connectors can be good for multi-way pots, but this is heads-up against a raiser from SB. He raised to 3x BB (48 total, BB is 16, so 3x). His range could be wide from SB. I'm getting pot odds: need to call 32 to win 64 pot (current pot 64). That's 2:1 odds, need 33% equity. Against a reasonable SB raising range, T7s might have around 30-40% equity? Let's estimate. Against top 50% of hands, T7s has about 40% equity. Against top 30%, maybe 35%. So pot odds might be borderline.\n\nBut also implied odds: if I call, I'll have 16 left behind, pot will be 96. Any flop I hit, I can get the rest in. However, stack-to-pot ratio will be low: after calling, pot 96, stack 16, SPR ~0.17, so basically committed. So if I call, I'm likely going all-in on any flop. So effectively, calling preflop is committing my stack.\n\nThus, decision is whether to fold or go all-in. Calling leaves me with a tiny stack that will be forced all-in on flop anyway, so might as well shove now to maybe get fold equity.\n\nIf I shove, he needs to call 16 more (since he has 48 total in, he'd need to call 16 to match my 64). Pot would be 64 (current) + my additional 48 = 112? Wait: If I shove for 64 total, I put in 48 more. He has put 48 total, needs to call 16 more. Pot becomes: his 48 + my 64 = 112? Actually total pot would be my 64 + his call of 64 = 128. But let's think: He raised to 48, I shove to 64, he needs to call 16 more. Pot will be his 48 + my 64 = 112, plus his call 16 = 128. So he's getting pot odds of 112:16 = 7:1, so he'll call with any two cards. So no fold equity.\n\nThus, shoving has no fold equity. So it's purely a showdown decision. So I need to compare equity of T7s vs his range.\n\nIf I call, I get to see a flop and can decide to fold if I miss, but with only 16 behind, I'll likely be forced all-in anyway. But maybe I can check-fold on flop if I completely miss? But pot will be 96, and I have 16 behind, so pot odds would be huge to call any bet. He'll likely bet small and I'll have to call. So"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with Td7d (ten-seven suited diamonds). My stack is 64 chips (4 BB). Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 48 total after posting SB 8. So the raise amount is 48 total, meaning I need to call 32 more (since I already have 16 in as BB). Pot is currently: SB 8 + my BB 16 + raise 48 = 72? Wait, let's calculate: SB posted 8, I posted 16, then Seat 2 raised to 48 total. That means he put in 48 total, which includes his SB 8, so additional 40. The pot is: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise additional 40 = 64 chips. Actually the display says \"Pot: 64 chips\". Yes.\n\nI have 64 chips total, with 16 already in, so I have 48 left. To call, I need to put in 32 more, leaving me with 16 behind. If I raise, minimum raise to 80 total (I think that means total chips put in). Since I have only 64 total, I can only raise all-in to 64 total, which would be a raise of 16 more? Wait: I have 64 total, with 16 already in, so I have 48 left. If I raise all-in to 64 total, that's an additional 48. But the minimum raise to is 80, which I cannot meet because I only have 64 total. So I can only call or fold, or go all-in for 64 total, which is a raise but less than min-raise? In No-Limit, you can always go all-in even if it's less than a min-raise. So \"raise\" is a legal action, meaning I can go all-in.\n\nSo options: fold, call 32, or raise all-in to 64 total.\n\nNow, hand strength: T7s is a speculative hand. Suited connectors can be good for multi-way pots, but this is heads-up against a raiser from SB. He raised to 3x BB (48 total, BB is 16, so 3x). His range could be wide from SB. I'm getting pot odds: need to call 32 to win 64 pot (current pot 64). That's 2:1 odds, need 33% equity. Against a reasonable SB raising range, T7s might have around 30-40% equity? Let's estimate. Against top 50% of hands, T7s has about 40% equity. Against top 30%, maybe 35%. So pot odds might be borderline.\n\nBut also implied odds: if I call, I'll have 16 left behind, pot will be 96. Any flop I hit, I can get the rest in. However, stack-to-pot ratio will be low: after calling, pot 96, stack 16, SPR ~0.17, so basically committed. So if I call, I'm likely going all-in on any flop. So effectively, calling preflop is committing my stack.\n\nThus, decision is whether to fold or go all-in. Calling leaves me with a tiny stack that will be forced all-in on flop anyway, so might as well shove now to maybe get fold equity.\n\nIf I shove, he needs to call 16 more (since he has 48 total in, he'd need to call 16 to match my 64). Pot would be 64 (current) + my additional 48 = 112? Wait: If I shove for 64 total, I put in 48 more. He has put 48 total, needs to call 16 more. Pot becomes: his 48 + my 64 = 112? Actually total pot would be my 64 + his call of 64 = 128. But let's think: He raised to 48, I shove to 64, he needs to call 16 more. Pot will be his 48 + my 64 = 112, plus his call 16 = 128. So he's getting pot odds of 112:16 = 7:1, so he'll call with any two cards. So no fold equity.\n\nThus, shoving has no fold equity. So it's purely a showdown decision. So I need to compare equity of T7s vs his range.\n\nIf I call, I get to see a flop and can decide to fold if I miss, but with only 16 behind, I'll likely be forced all-in anyway. But maybe I can check-fold on flop if I completely miss? But pot will be 96, and I have 16 behind, so pot odds would be huge to call any bet. He'll likely bet small and I'll have to call. So",

          "reasoning_content": "Looking at opponent's raising patterns: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop multiple times with varying sizes: 12, 10, 24, 24, 60, 164, 24, 24, 48, 48. The recent hands (67, 68) he raised to 48. In hand 67 he had 66 (pocket sixes), in hand 68 he had AA. So his raising range includes both strong hands and medium pairs. He's aggressive.\n\nMy stack is only 4 BB. With T7s, I'm getting 2:1 pot odds. Against a typical SB stealing range, T7s has about 40% equity. That's better than the 33% needed. However, if his range is tighter due to my short stack, maybe he's raising only stronger hands. But given he's raised with 66 and AA recently, his range might be wide.\n\nGiven my stack size, I'm in push-or-fold territory. With 4 BB, I should be shoving a wide range from BB vs SB raise. T7s is borderline but probably okay to shove. Folding leaves me with 4 BB, which is still playable but desperate. Calling is bad because it commits me without initiative.\n\nIf I shove, he'll call with any two due to pot odds (he needs to call 16 to win 112, getting 7:1). So it's a pure equity race. Let's estimate equity: T7s vs random hand: ~55%. vs top 50%: ~48%. vs top 30%: ~43%. vs top 20%: ~40%. vs pairs 77+ and broadways: maybe 35%. So likely around 40-45% equity.\n\nPot if I shove: I risk 48 more (total 64). If he calls, pot is 128. My equity share: 0.4 * 128 = 51.2 chips. Minus my investment 48 = +3.2 chips expected value. If he folds (unlikely but possible if he's bluffing with total trash and doesn't want to call even with great odds), I win 64 pot immediately. But he'll almost always call.\n\nIf I fold, I have 48 left (3 BB). That's still okay for next hand.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, with 4 BB I need to double up soon. This might be a decent spot. T7s is not great but has some equity. I think shoving is reasonable.\n\nLet's check if there are any other factors: I'm in BB, he's in SB. He might be stealing wide. I have seen him raise to same size 48 in last two hands. He might be adjusting to my short stack.\n\nI think I'll go all-in.",

Ace-nine offsuit is not a strong hand from early position.\n- In a 5-handed game (which this appears to be), hand values go up slightly, but UTG is still early position.\n\nMy position: UTG (first to act)\n- This is the worst position preflop\n- I have 4 players behind me who could raise\n\nMy stack: 267 chips (33.4 BB)\n- This is a medium stack in tournament terms\n- Not in immediate danger, but also not deep stacked\n\nTournament considerations:\n- I should be somewhat protective of my stack\n- UTG with A9o is a clear fold in most situations\n- The table seems tight, but that doesn't make A9o from UTG profitable\n\nGiven that I'm UTG with A9o, facing 4 players behind me, this is a clear fold. The hand is too weak to open from early position, and calling the BB just to see a flop would be -EV.

My stack is 185 chips (23.1 BB). Blinds are 4/8. The small blind (Seat 4) posted 4, big blind (Seat 5) posted 8. Two players folded, so it's folded to me on the button.\n\nI have 9T suited connectors (though not suited - one club, one heart). This is a decent speculative hand from the button, especially with fold equity. The blinds have 180 and 132 chips respectively. I need to call 8 to see a flop, or I can raise to 16 minimum.\n\nPosition is excellent - I'm on the button. With two players in the blinds, I have good stealing potential. 9T has decent playability postflop, especially from position.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 23.1 BB, which is getting into push/fold territory but not quite there yet. The blinds have similar stacks.\n\nStandard play here would be to raise to steal the blinds, or possibly call to see a flop cheaply. Given my position and hand strength, I should probably raise. A standard raise would be 2.5-3x, so 20-24 chips. The minimum raise is to 16, but I should raise more to deny odds.\n\nLet me check if I have any history on these opponents. But first, I need to make a decision. I'll raise to 20 chips (2.5x). This puts pressure on the blinds and gives me initiative.\n\nReasoning: On the button with 9T, excellent position, good stealing opportunity against two blinds. Raising to 20 chips (2.5x) applies pressure and denies odds. If called, I have position and a hand that can make strong draws or pairs.",

            "reasoning_content": "Looking at the opponent's history, I can see that DeepSeek-V3.2 has been very tight, folding 10 consecutive times in recent hands (hands 38-47). This is the first time they've raised in a while. However, I have Kc 4d which is a very weak hand, especially from the small blind position.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. My hand is Kc 4d - this is a very weak hand, especially out of position\n2. I'm in the small blind, so I'd be out of position for the entire hand\n3. The opponent has been very tight recently (10 folds in a row), but this raise suggests they have something\n4. I need to call 16 chips to stay in, which is about 9% of my stack\n5. If I call, I'd be playing out of position with a weak hand against a player who seems to be playing tight\n\nThis is clearly a fold situation. K4 offsuit is one of the weakest hands in poker, especially from the small blind. Even if the opponent has been folding a lot, when they do raise, they likely have a decent hand. Playing K4o out of position is a recipe for disaster.\n\nI should fold here.",

I need to call 2 chips to see the flop.\n\n5. **Opponent info**: No historical data available yet.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3, so 2:3 or 40% equity needed. Even against random hands, 2-6 offsuit has terrible equity.\n\nWith 2-6 offsuit, this is an easy fold. The hand has virtually no potential:\n- No straight possibilities (would need 3-4-5 to hit a straight, very unlikely)\n- Not suited, so no flush draw\n- Low cards that won't make strong pairs\n- Even if I hit a pair, it will be a weak pair likely dominated\n\nI should fold this hand and wait for a better spot.",

Looking at their recent history:\n- They folded preflop in hands 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 (6 consecutive hands)\n- In hand 65, they called preflop, then called a raise, checked the flop, and made a big bet on the turn (80 chips)\n\nThis suggests they're playing relatively tight but will occasionally limp with some hands. The fact they've folded 6 hands in a row suggests they might be getting impatient or could be looking to play a hand.\n\nMy hand: 4c 7d - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. \n\nMy position: Button - Good position, but with a terrible hand.\n\nStack size: 151 chips (9.4 BB) - I'm short-stacked. \n\nPot: 32 chips (2 BB)\n\nSince there's nothing to call (amount to call is 0), I can check and see a free flop. However, with 4c 7d, even seeing a free flop is questionable because:\n1. The hand has very little potential\n2. I'm short-stacked and should be selective\n3. Even if I hit something, it's unlikely to be the best hand\n4. I risk getting trapped or losing more chips postflop\n\nGiven my short stack (9.4 BB) and terrible hand, I should preserve my chips for better spots. The opponent has shown they can fold a lot, so there will be better opportunities to steal or play real hands.\n\nThe best play here is to fold and wait for a better hand or situation.",

            "content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 4c 7d (bottom pair with 4)\n- Board: Kc 4s Ks (two Kings, one 4)\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- To call: 48 chips\n- My stack: 151 chips (9.4 BB)\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in SB position, bet 48 on the flop\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have a pair of 4s on a K-K-4 board. This means I have trips (three of a kind) with 4s. This is actually a very strong hand! The board is K-K-4, so I have 4-4-4-K-K (full house, 4s full of Kings).\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall data on MiniMax-M2:\n- They fold preflop frequently (hands 59, 61, 63, 66-71)\n- When they do play, they bet aggressively on flops (hand 60: bet 40, hand 65: bet 80 on turn)\n- In hand 60, they bet 40 on flop, then checked turn and folded\n- They seem to be a relatively tight-aggressive player who folds a lot preflop but bets when they have something\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 80\n- To call: 48\n- Pot odds: 80:48 or ~1.67:1\n- This is about 37.5% equity needed to call\n\n**My Situation:**\n- I have a full house (4s full of Kings)\n- This is an extremely strong hand, likely the best hand\n- The only hands beating me would be K-x (trip Kings) or pocket Ks/KK (four of a kind)\n- Given opponent's betting pattern, they could have:\n  - A King (top pair)\n  - A pocket pair\n  - Some draw\n  - Complete bluff\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\n- I have 151 chips, which is short at 9.4 BB\n- I need to accumulate chips or I'll be blinded out\n- This is a strong hand to get my money in with\n\n**Decision:**\nI should raise here. I have a full house and need to build the pot and protect against any potential draws (though there aren't many dangerous draws on this board). A King would be the main concern, but even then I have trips and am likely ahead.\n\nMinimum raise is to 96, but I could also go all-in for 151. Given my short stack and the strength of my hand, going all-in makes sense to maximize pressure and potentially get called by worse hands.\n\nLet me think about the sizing:\n- If I raise to 96, that leaves me with 55 chips\n- If I just go all-in for 151, I put maximum pressure\n\nWith a full house on this board, I want to get value. Going all-in might fold out some hands, but given my short stack and the pot size, it's a reasonable play. However, a smaller raise might keep in more hands.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the board: Kc 4s Ks\nI have 4c 7d, so I have trip 4s, not a full house. The board is K-K-4, so if I have a 4, I have three 4s. That's trip 4s, which loses to any K-x hand (trip Kings).\n\nSo I have trip 4s, and the opponent could easily have a King. If they have any King, they have trip Kings which beats my trip 4s.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- Board: K-K-4\n- My hand: 4-7\n- My hand: 4-4-4-K-K (trip 4s with K-K kickers)\n- If opponent has K-x: K-K-K-4-x (trip Kings with 4 kicker) - they win\n\nSo I'm losing to any King. What are the chances they have a King?\n- They called preflop from SB after I checked as BB\n- They could have a wide range: any pocket pair, any two broadway, any suited connectors, any King\n- The flop bet of 48 into a pot of 32 (after preflop action) is a 1.5x pot bet, which is strong\n\nGiven this, I might be behind. Let me think about the opponent's pattern:\n- They bet 40 on flop in hand 60, then checked turn and folded - suggests they bet for value/protection but gave up\n- They bet 80 on turn in hand 65 - strong bet\n\nThe bet of 48 here is quite large relative to the pot. This suggests strength.\n\n**Revised Decision:**\nI have trip 4s but any King beats me."

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 4c 7d (bottom pair with 4)\n- Board: Kc 4s Ks (two Kings, one 4)\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- To call: 48 chips\n- My stack: 151 chips (9.4 BB)\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in SB position, bet 48 on the flop\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have a pair of 4s on a K-K-4 board. This means I have trips (three of a kind) with 4s. This is actually a very strong hand! The board is K-K-4, so I have 4-4-4-K-K (full house, 4s full of Kings).\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall data on MiniMax-M2:\n- They fold preflop frequently (hands 59, 61, 63, 66-71)\n- When they do play, they bet aggressively on flops (hand 60: bet 40, hand 65: bet 80 on turn)\n- In hand 60, they bet 40 on flop, then checked turn and folded\n- They seem to be a relatively tight-aggressive player who folds a lot preflop but bets when they have something\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 80\n- To call: 48\n- Pot odds: 80:48 or ~1.67:1\n- This is about 37.5% equity needed to call\n\n**My Situation:**\n- I have a full house (4s full of Kings)\n- This is an extremely strong hand, likely the best hand\n- The only hands beating me would be K-x (trip Kings) or pocket Ks/KK (four of a kind)\n- Given opponent's betting pattern, they could have:\n  - A King (top pair)\n  - A pocket pair\n  - Some draw\n  - Complete bluff\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\n- I have 151 chips, which is short at 9.4 BB\n- I need to accumulate chips or I'll be blinded out\n- This is a strong hand to get my money in with\n\n**Decision:**\nI should raise here. I have a full house and need to build the pot and protect against any potential draws (though there aren't many dangerous draws on this board). A King would be the main concern, but even then I have trips and am likely ahead.\n\nMinimum raise is to 96, but I could also go all-in for 151. Given my short stack and the strength of my hand, going all-in makes sense to maximize pressure and potentially get called by worse hands.\n\nLet me think about the sizing:\n- If I raise to 96, that leaves me with 55 chips\n- If I just go all-in for 151, I put maximum pressure\n\nWith a full house on this board, I want to get value. Going all-in might fold out some hands, but given my short stack and the pot size, it's a reasonable play. However, a smaller raise might keep in more hands.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the board: Kc 4s Ks\nI have 4c 7d, so I have trip 4s, not a full house. The board is K-K-4, so if I have a 4, I have three 4s. That's trip 4s, which loses to any K-x hand (trip Kings).\n\nSo I have trip 4s, and the opponent could easily have a King. If they have any King, they have trip Kings which beats my trip 4s.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- Board: K-K-4\n- My hand: 4-7\n- My hand: 4-4-4-K-K (trip 4s with K-K kickers)\n- If opponent has K-x: K-K-K-4-x (trip Kings with 4 kicker) - they win\n\nSo I'm losing to any King. What are the chances they have a King?\n- They called preflop from SB after I checked as BB\n- They could have a wide range: any pocket pair, any two broadway, any suited connectors, any King\n- The flop bet of 48 into a pot of 32 (after preflop action) is a 1.5x pot bet, which is strong\n\nGiven this, I might be behind. Let me think about the opponent's pattern:\n- They bet 40 on flop in hand 60, then checked turn and folded - suggests they bet for value/protection but gave up\n- They bet 80 on turn in hand 65 - strong bet\n\nThe bet of 48 here is quite large relative to the pot. This suggests strength.\n\n**Revised Decision:**\nI have trip 4s but any King beats me.",

This is a strong hand BUT any King beats me (trip Kings). The board is paired with Kings, and I have the lower pair.\n\n**Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 bet 48 into 32 pot (1.5x pot). This is a strong bet. Looking at their history:\n- They fold preflop a lot (tight)\n- When they bet on flops, they bet big (40, 48, 80)\n- They seem to bet for value with strong hands\n\n**Pot odds:** 48 to win 80, so I need about 37.5% equity.\n\n**My situation:** I'm short-stacked at 9.4 BB.

Given the opponent's strong betting pattern and the fact that they called preflop from SB, they could easily have:\n- Any King (Kx) - which would be trip Kings\n- Pocket pairs that hit the 4\n- A full house (if they have K4)\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to bet big with strong hands, and the fact that I'm losing to any King, this is likely a fold.

Given their folding pattern, they likely don't have a premium hand this time. My King-high has reasonable equity and I'm already invested 8 chips in the BB.\n\nThe call is clearly correct - I can see a cheap flop and potentially win this uncontested if my opponent continues their passive trend.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Calling the 8 chips with King-high against a very tight opponent who folds 93% of hands.

The opponent is very tight/passive (folds 93% of hands)\n2. I have decent pot odds (3:1)\n3. My hand has decent playability\n4. I'm in the BB so I've already invested 8 chips\n\nThe call seems correct. If the opponent is as tight as their history suggests, they likely don't have a premium hand and I might win this pot uncontested post-flop, or at worst get to see a cheap flop with decent equity.\n\nHowever, I should be prepared that if they do have a strong hand and show aggression, I may need to fold quickly given my short stack.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: UTG (Under the Gun - earliest position)\n- Cards: Td 3d (Ten of diamonds, Three of diamonds)\n- Stack: 247 chips (30.9 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- To call: 8 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- T3s (suited) is a very weak hand, especially from UTG\n- From early position, we should be playing only premium hands\n- T3s has poor equity against typical calling/raising ranges\n- Even though it's suited, the potential is very limited\n\n**Position Considerations:**\n- UTG is the worst position post-flop (act first on every street)\n- We have 7 players still to act behind us\n- Any raise from us would likely get called or re-raised by better hands\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (from recall):**\nLooking at the opponent actions:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been folding a lot preflop, but made a raise to 24 in hand 41\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Frequently folding preflop\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Mix of folds and raises (raised to 12 in hand 40)\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has called and folded, seems somewhat passive\n\n**Stack Size Considerations:**\n- We have 30.9 BB, which is a decent stack but not deep\n- We shouldn't risk chips with marginal hands\n- Tournament survival is important - we don't need to take unnecessary risks\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. T3s from UTG is a trash hand that should never be played in this position. The risk of running into a much better hand is extremely high, and even if we hit a flush or straight, we won't often get paid off enough to justify the preflop investment.\n\nThe math is simple: we have to put in 8 chips to win 12 (1.5:1 pot odds), but our hand equity is likely less than 20% against any reasonable range of hands that would call or raise us.",

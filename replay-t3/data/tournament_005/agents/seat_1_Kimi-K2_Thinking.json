This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. After I act, 4 more players will act behind me. With a weak hand like J6o, there's a very high chance someone behind me has a much better hand.\n\n**Stack Size:**\nI have 100 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take risks with marginal hands.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nEarly in a tournament with 100 BB, I should be playing tight, especially from early position. I want to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nPot is 3, I need to call 2. That's 3:2 or 1.5:1 pot odds. While these odds aren't terrible, they're not relevant here because my hand is so weak and I'm out of position.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nI should check if I have any information about the opponents, but from UTG with J6o, this is a clear fold regardless of opponent tendencies.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. J6 offsuit is not a profitable hand to play from UTG. I should wait for better hands and better positions.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold based on fundamental poker strategy. J6o from UTG is a fold 100% of the time.",

However, I have a very weak hand.\n\n3. **Stack**: I have 198 chips (99 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - SB posted 1 chip\n   - I posted BB 2 chips\n   - Everyone folded to SB (GPT-OSS-120B) who raised to 4\n   - I need to call 2 more chips to see a flop\n\n5. **Opponent info**: GPT-OSS-120B has been very passive:\n   - Folded first 2 hands preflop\n   - In hand #3, they checked all streets (preflop through river)\n   - This suggests they might be a tight/passive player\n   \n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is currently 6 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 4 raise)\n   - I need to call 2 chips\n   - Pot odds: 6:2 or 3:1\n   - With 3:1 odds, I need ~25% equity to break even\n\n7. **Hand equity**: 3-7 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. Against a typical raising range, I likely have less than 25% equity.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I have a healthy stack at 99 BB\n   - No need to take marginal spots\n   - Better to wait for better hands/positions\n\nEven though I'm getting 3:1 pot odds and I have position, 3-7 offsuit is just too weak.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand**: 3s Qh (Queen high, offsuit, with a low kicker)\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Best position postflop\n**Stack**: 197 chips (98.5 BB) - Very healthy stack\n**Pot**: 3 chips\n**To call**: 1 chip (half a big blind)\n\n**Opponent info**: Kimi-K2 has folded in 3 out of 4 hands preflop, raised once to 6 chips. Sample is small but suggests they might be somewhat tight.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Q3 offsuit is a very weak hand. Even though I have a Queen, the 3 kicker is terrible. This hand is in the bottom 20% of starting hands.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is great, but that matters more postflop. Preflop, position helps but doesn't make up for a terrible hand.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 1 to win 3, so 3:1 pot odds. This is attractive, but with Q3o, even these odds don't justify calling. I need roughly 25% equity to break even, and Q3o against a random hand has about 45% equity, BUT...\n\n4. **Opponent's range**: The BB (Kimi-K2) has shown some tightness. When they defend their BB, they'll likely have better hands than Q3o. Against a reasonable defending range, Q3o has terrible equity.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 98.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. There's no need to get involved with marginal situations. Preserving my stack and waiting for better spots is the correct tournament strategy.\n\n6. **Postflop playability**: Q3o has terrible playability. If I hit a Queen, I'll be dominated by better kickers. If I hit a 3, it's rarely good. The hand is not suited, so no flush potential.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. The tiny investment of 1 chip might seem insignificant, but it's -EV in the long run. Tournament poker is about preserving chips for good spots, not getting involved with trash hands even when getting good pot odds.\n\nI'll fold and wait for a better hand/situation.",

Limited data but seems somewhat tight.\n- Seat 3 (BB): Folded all 4 recorded preflop hands. Very tight player so far.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 9s 6c is a very weak hand, unsuited and not connected enough to have good implied odds. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: While being on the button is excellent, it doesn't make up for the poor hand quality.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: Both opponents appear to be on the tighter side based on limited data, which means if I call and hit something, they might be more likely to have strong hands and pay me off. However, this is speculative with such limited data.\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3, so 1.5:1 pot odds. With 9s 6c, I'd need much better odds to justify playing this hand.\n\n5. **Stack Size**: I have a healthy stack and don't need to take risks with marginal hands. Preserving my stack is important in tournament play.\n\n6. **Implied Odds**: Even if I hit a 9 or 6, I'll often be dominated by better kickers. If I hit a straight (very unlikely), it could be well-disguised, but the probability is too low to justify the call.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, the pot odds aren't good enough, and I don't need to take unnecessary risks with a healthy stack. Playing 9-6 offsuit from any position is generally a losing play long-term.",

Very weak.\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I have 4 players to act behind me\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: The table seems somewhat tight based on recent folds\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 to win 3, which is 1.5:1. This is not relevant with such a weak hand\n5. **Tournament considerations**: Early in tournament, no need to take risks with marginal hands. Stack preservation is key.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is an easy fold. T5o from UTG is a clear fold.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have 8d 3s - this is a terrible hand, one of the worst starting hands in poker. It's unsuited, not connected, and both cards are low.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is decent position postflop, but we're still preflop.\n\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 has been very tight - they folded in 7 out of 10 recent hands, and the only time they called was when they could just limp in for 1 chip (when they were in SB). They haven't shown any aggression.\n\n4. **Action**: MiniMax-M2 just called 2 chips (limped in). This could mean:\n   - They have a marginal hand they want to see a flop with cheaply\n   - They have a strong hand trying to trap\n   - Given their tight history, more likely a marginal hand\n\n5. **Pot odds**: There's 5 chips in the pot (1 SB + 2 BB + 2 call). I can check for free since I'm in BB.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 195 chips (97.5 BB), which is a healthy stack. I don't need to take risks with a terrible hand like 83o.\n\n7. **Postflop potential**: Even if I flop something with 83o, it's unlikely to be the best hand. If I flop an 8, I'm likely dominated by better 8s. If I flop a 3, same issue. If I flop two pair, I'm still vulnerable. The only good scenario is flopping a straight or trips, which is very unlikely (about 1.3% chance).\n\nThe opponent is tight and just limped. I should check and see the flop for free. There's no reason to raise with this garbage hand. I could fold, but checking is free and gives me a chance to see if I hit a miracle flop. However, I need to be prepared to fold to any aggression postflop unless I hit something very strong.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - I have one of the worst hands in poker. Even checking could lead me into trouble postflop. The best play is probably to just check and see the flop since it's free, but be very ready to fold to any bet unless I hit a monster.\n\nI'll check and see the flop.",

No pair, no draw, no backdoor flush/straight potential worth pursuing.\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position, which is bad for bluffing.\n3. **Opponent Tendency**: MiniMax-M2 is very tight. If they called preflop, they likely have something. Bluffing a tight player who likely has a real hand is not profitable.\n4. **Pot Size**: The pot is tiny (5 chips), not worth fighting for.\n5. **Stack Preservation**: I have a healthy stack of 195 chips. No need to risk chips in a bad spot.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear check/fold situation. I should check and fold to any bet. Checking gives me a free chance to see if I improve (though it's very unlikely with 8-high), and folding to any aggression is the correct play.\n\nSince the amount to call is 0, I should check.",

I have 8-high with no flush draw, straight draw, or pair.\n\n2. **The board**: Qd 6h 4c - The flop has a Queen and some lower cards. I have absolutely nothing here.\n\n3. **The action**: \n   - Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called from position (seat 4)\n   - I checked in BB\n   - On the flop, I checked and MiniMax-M2 bet 2 chips into a 7 chip pot\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n   - Very tight player who has folded preflop most hands (hands 1,2,4,5,6,7,8)\n   - Only played hand #3 where they called preflop and then checked down all streets\n   - This is the first time I've seen them bet postflop\n\n5. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is 7 chips\n   - Bet is 2 chips\n   - I need to call 2 to win 9 (pot + opponent's bet)\n   - That's 22% equity needed\n\n6. **My equity**: I have 8-high. I need to hit an 8 to have any chance, but even then I could be beaten by:\n   - Any pair (Q, 6, or 4)\n   - Any higher card\n   - Any future cards that give opponent a better hand\n   \n   I have 3 outs (the remaining 8s), which is roughly 12% equity on the flop. This is well below the 22% I need.\n\n7. **Position**: I'm out of position which makes it harder to control the pot or bluff later.\n\n8. **Stack size**: I have 195 chips which is healthy at 97.5 BB. No need to make desperate calls.\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: This is a trivial call in terms of chips, but it's a -EV play. Calling here would be throwing away 2 chips with a very weak hand against a tight opponent who likely has something when they bet.\n\nThe decision is clear: fold.",

The raises have been to 6 or 8 chips. This suggests they defend their BB somewhat aggressively but not always.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak - 84s is a trash hand\n2. **Position**: Excellent (on the button)\n3. **Pot odds**: Very good - calling 1 to win 3 (3:1)\n4. **Implied odds**: Minimal with this hand\n5. **Opponent tendency**: BB seems to defend with raises sometimes (3/8 times)\n6. **Tournament situation**: Deep stacked, can afford to see flops with marginal hands in position\n\n**Considerations:**\n- If I call 1 chip and BB raises, I'll have to fold and lose that chip\n- If I fold, I lose 1 chip (the SB)\n- The hand is very weak but the price is cheap\n- In position, I can often win pots postflop even with weak hands\n- However, 84s has very poor equity against any reasonable defending range\n\n**Recommendation**: \nDespite the good pot odds and position, 84s is just too weak to play profitably. The opponent has shown they defend their BB with raises about 37.5% of the time, and when they do raise, I'll have to fold my 1 chip investment. Even when they don't raise, I'll be out of position postflop (wait, no - I'm on the button, so I have position), but with a hand that rarely makes strong hands.\n\n\nFolding this hand is the most disciplined play, preserving chips for better opportunities. The minimal potential gain doesn't justify the risk with such a weak hand. I'll cut my losses and wait for a stronger starting hand that offers more strategic potential.",

King is decent but 4 kicker is very weak.\n- Not suited, not connected, poor playability postflop\n\n**Position:** Button (BTN) - Best position at the table\n- I act last postflop, which is advantageous\n- Can see what others do before acting\n\n**Stack:** 194 chips (97 BB) - Healthy stack, deep tournament stack\n\n**Current situation:**\n- SB posted 1 chip\n- BB posted 2 chips\n- Pot is 3 chips\n- I need to call 2 chips to see flop\n- Min raise is 4 chips\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) in SB: Mix of folds and raises. Has raised to 6 chips (3x) and 8 chips (4x) in previous hands. Seems to be an active player who raises with decent hands.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) in BB: Has folded every single preflop action in the last 8 hands! This is extremely tight/nitty play. They fold to any pressure.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Very weak. K4o is not a hand I want to play, especially from early position. But I'm on the button.\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is great, but with such a weak hand, position advantage is limited.\n3. **Opponents:** The BB player folds 100% of the time to any action. The SB player is active but has shown they can fold too.\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 2 chips to win 3 chips (1.5:1). Not great odds for a weak hand.\n5. **Steal opportunity:** Given that BB folds 100% of the time, this is a perfect steal situation. If I raise, BB will likely fold, and SB might fold too.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear steal situation. The BB player is extremely tight and folds everything. Even with a weak hand like K4o, raising from the button against a tight BB is profitable. The SB player is also capable of folding.\n\nI should raise to steal the blinds. A standard raise of 2.5x-3x the BB would be 5-6 chips. Given the SB player's pattern of raising to 6 chips, I'll raise to 6 chips which is 3x the BB.\n\nThis is a low-risk, high-reward play. If both fold, I win 3 chips (1.5% of my stack). If I get called, I have position and a King which has some showdown value.\n\nLet me raise to 6 chips.",

The fact they called preflop suggests they have something. On this Ace-high board, they likely have:\n- An Ace (A-x)\n- A pocket pair (maybe 99, 77, or TT-QQ)\n- A flush draw with spades\n- Possibly a straight draw\n\n**Decision:**\nI have a very weak hand (K-high) on an Ace-high board with some draws. My opponent is tight and checked to me. I should check behind here because:\n1. I have very little equity with just K-high\n2. My opponent is tight and called preflop, suggesting they have something\n3. I'm in position and can see a free card\n4. If I bet, I'm unlikely to get folds from any Ace, pair, or draw\n5.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with Ks 4d\n- Stack: 188 chips (94 BB)\n- Board: Ah 9s 7s 6d\n- Pot: 13 chips\n- It's the turn, and Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has checked to me\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check for free)\n- Minimum raise to: 4\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have Ks 4d\n- Board shows Ah 9s 7s 6d\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 5 to complete 4-5-6-7-8 or 5-6-7-8-9)\n- I have a flush draw with Ks (but the Ace of spades is on board, so my flush would be vulnerable)\n- Actually wait, let me re-evaluate: I have Ks, board has Ah 9s 7s 6d. So I have a flush draw with 3 spades on board (Ah, 9s, 7s) plus my Ks. So I need one more spade for a flush.\n\n**Outs:**\n- Straight draw: I need an 8 for a straight (4-5-6-7-8 or 5-6-7-8-9). Actually with 4-6-7-9 on board, I could make a straight with 5 or 8. Wait, let me count again: I have 4d, board is Ah 9s 7s 6d. So I have 4-6-7-9. I need a 5 or 8 for a straight. That's 8 outs.\n- Flush draw: I have Ks and there are 2 spades on board (9s, 7s). So I need another spade. There are 13 spades total, 3 are visible (my Ks, 9s, 7s). So 10 spades left. But some of these might be straight outs already counted. The 5s and 8s would give me a straight flush possibility. So I need to be careful not to double-count.\n\n\n- My total outs are approximately 15, considering the overlap between straight and flush possibilities\n- This gives me around a 30% chance of hitting my hand by the river\n\n**Position and betting:**\n- I'm in position on the button\n- My opponent checked, indicating potential weakness\n- The pot is relatively small at 13 chips\n- A value bet could be effective, but I must consider my opponent's potential responses\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Checking allows me to see the river card for free\n- Betting could protect my draw and potentially win the pot immediately\n- My opponent's passive play suggests they might have a marginal hand\n\nI'll analyze my opponent's playing style carefully. With a 194-chip stack and 97 BB, they're in a solid position. Checking twice often signals weakness or a marginal holding like a small pair or draw. The preflop call suggests a moderately strong starting hand, possibly a pocket pair or suited connectors.\n\nTheir preflop call indicates they likely have something interesting, but not a premium hand. The postflop checks hint at uncertainty or a desire to control the pot size. I'll need to weigh the potential risks and rewards of different betting strategies carefully.\n\nMy stack size provides flexibility, allowing for strategic aggression without immediate danger. The current board texture offers multiple potential draws and interesting possibilities for both players.\n\nI have 15 outs, giving me approximately a 30% chance of improving my hand. The pot odds suggest checking might be the most prudent move right now. While a semi-bluff could potentially win the pot immediately, my opponent's passive play indicates they might be waiting for a strong hand. Checking allows me to see the next card without additional risk, preserving my tournament position and maintaining strategic flexibility.\n\nThe key consideration is balancing potential improvement against unnecessary chip expenditure. With a decent draw but uncertain board dynamics, a cautious approach seems most appropriate.\n\nChecking provides a free opportunity to develop my hand, which aligns with the current strategic assessment of minimizing risk while maintaining potential for future action.\n\nA semi-bluff bet of 4 chips could be an alternative approach, but without clear opponent reads, the conservative check remains the most prudent play.",

Let me analyze:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My hand: Ks 4d (King of spades, 4 of diamonds)\n- Board: Ah 9s 7s 6d Th\n- I have King high only. The board shows: Ace, 9, 7, 6, 10\n- No pair, no straight (I don't have an 8 for a straight), no flush (I only have one spade)\n- Best hand I can make is Ace-high (using the Ace on board), but I lose to any pair\n\n**Situation:**\n- Opponent: DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB\n- They bet 6 into a pot of 19\n- I need to call 6 to win 25 (pot odds: 6/25 = 24%)\n- They called preflop from BB, then checked flop and turn, now betting river\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 called from BB preflop (could have many hands)\n- Checked twice, now betting river - this is often a value bet\n- The board has multiple straight possibilities (8 would complete straight), and a flush draw that missed\n- Their river bet suggests they have something - could be:\n  - A pair (any Ace, 9, 7, 6, 10)\n  - Two pair\n  - Set\n  - Or could be a bluff trying to represent the Ace or a made hand\n\n**My situation:**\n- I have pure air - just King high\n- I cannot beat ANY pair\n- I lose to any Ace, 9, 7, 6, 10\n- Even if they have a missed flush draw, they still have Ace high which beats my King high\n- The only hands I beat are complete bluffs with worse high cards\n\n**Pot odds:** 24% - I need to be good 24% of the time to break even\n**But:** Against a river bet after checking twice, the bluff frequency is likely low. Most players don't bluff rivers often, especially in small pots.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** \n- I have 188 chips (94 BB) - healthy stack\n- Losing 6 chips won't hurt much\n- But calling with pure air is -EV against most opponents\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. I have no showdown value and am unlikely to be ahead. The opponent's betting pattern suggests they have something, and even if they're bluffing, I only beat some bluffs (they could have Queen high, Jack high, etc. which still beat my King high in some cases).\n\nI should fold here.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has made a raise to 4 chips. Let me analyze their pattern:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n- They raised to 4 in hand #4 as well\n- In hand #3 they went to showdown with 2s 5s (a very weak offsuit hand)\n- Their raise size is consistent at 4 chips (2x the big blind)\n\nThis suggests they might be playing somewhat loose/weak. The raise to 4 could be:\n1. A standard opening with a decent hand\n2. A steal attempt \n3. A weak hand trying to see a flop cheaply\n\nMy hand Qs Jd is a decent hand in CO position:\n- Suited queen is good\n- Can make strong top pairs, straights, flushes\n- I'm 94 BB deep which is comfortable\n- There's only one player behind me (Seat 2)\n\nThe pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 7 (SB+BB+raise), so about 1.75:1 or 36% equity needed. QJs definitely has that against a typical raising range.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and the opponent's tendency to fold a lot preflop, I should either:\n1. Call and see a flop in position\n2. Raise to isolate and potentially take it down preflop\n\nA raise would be good because:\n- I have position post-flop\n- The opponent folds a lot, so I might win immediately\n- If they call, I have a strong hand that plays well post-flop\n- I can control the pot size\n\nLet me make a standard raise to about 12-14 chips (3x their raise). That would be to 14-16 total, but minimum raise is 6. I think 12-14 is good.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With QJs in the CO facing a min-raise from a loose player who folds a lot, I should be aggressive. I'll raise to 12 chips total (3x their raise).",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand details:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- Cards: Qs Jd (offsuit)\n- Stack: 176 chips (88 BB)\n- Board: 2c Kd 9h\n- Pot: 27 chips\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5)\n\n**Preflop action:**\n- Seat 5 raised to 4\n- I 3-bet to 12\n- Seat 5 called 8\n\n**Flop action:**\n- Seat 5 checked\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Minimum raise: 8\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have QJ offsuit\n- Board: 2c Kd 9h\n- I missed the flop completely - no pair, no straight draw, no flush draw\n- Only backdoor straight possibilities (need 10 then K, or 10 then 8, etc.)\n\n**Opponent tendencies (from recall):**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's actions:\n- Very tight preflop: folded 7 hands in a row (hands 5-11)\n- Only played hand #4 preflop with a raise\n- In hand #3, they checked turn and river\n- They called my 3-bet preflop, which suggests some strength\n\n**Opponent's likely range:**\nGiven they called my 3-bet after being tight, they likely have:\n- Pocket pairs: 99-QQ, possibly KK/AA\n- Big Broadway cards: AQ, AJ, KQ\n- Maybe some suited connectors\n\n**Board texture:**\n- Dry board with K-9-2 rainbow\n- King is high card\n- Not many draws possible\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak - just Q-high\n2. **Position**: I'm in position (on the button), which is good\n3. **Opponent's action**: They checked to me - could be weak or trapping\n4. **Pot size**: 27 chips, which is about 15% of my stack\n5. **Continuation bet**: Standard play would be to c-bet here since I was the aggressor preflop\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: Take a free card, see if I improve on turn. I have 6 outs to a pair (3 Qs, 3 Js), plus backdoor draws.\n- **Bet**: Standard c-bet to represent the King and try to take down the pot. Bet sizing would be around 13-18 chips (half pot to 2/3 pot).\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (88 BB)\n- This is a small pot relative to my stack\n- Taking down 27 chips would be a nice win\n\n**Opponent's check:**\nCould mean:\n1. They missed the flop completely and are giving up\n2. They have a medium-strength hand and want to pot control\n3. They're trapping with a monster (KK, 99, 22, AK)\n\nGiven their tight nature, if they had a monster like a set or top two, they might be more likely to bet for value. The check suggests weakness more often than not.\n\n**My decision:**\nI should make a continuation bet here. As the preflop aggressor, betting the flop is standard and represents strength. Even though I missed, the opponent's check suggests weakness, and I can take down this pot a good percentage of the time.\n\nBet sizing: About 14-16 chips (slightly over half pot) seems appropriate. This puts pressure on opponent without risking too much of my stack.\n\nMinimum raise is 8, but that seems too small for a c-bet. I should bet around 14-16.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the raise_to value. The minimum raise to is 8, which means total bet of 8. But that's only 8 chips into a 27 chip pot - too small. \n\nWait, I need to understand the betting structure better. The \"minimum raise to\" means the smallest TOTAL amount I can put in if I raise. So if I raise to 8, I'm betting 8 chips total (not adding 8 to something).\n\nFor a proper c-bet, I should bet around 14-18 chips. Let me bet 16, which is about 60% of pot - a standard c-bet size.\n\nFinal decision: Raise to 16 (bet 16 chips).",

However, I have a set, which is still very strong.\n\n**Position**: I'm in BB and it's checked to me. MiniMax-M2 is the only other player.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- Very tight player - has folded preflop 12 out of 14 hands\n- Only called preflop twice (hands 3 and 9)\n- In hand 9, they called preflop and then bet 2 on the flop\n- No showdowns seen, so we don't know what cards they play\n\n**Pot**: Currently 5 chips\n**My Stack**: 201 chips (very healthy)\n\n**Decision**: I have a strong hand (set of 3s) but the board is dangerous with 3 clubs. However, my opponent is very tight. I should bet for value here. The question is how much.\n\nGiven the board texture (3 clubs) and that my opponent is tight, they likely have something if they're continuing. I should make a solid value bet to protect against the flush draw and get value from weaker hands.\n\nA bet of 4-6 chips seems appropriate - enough to charge flush draws but not so big that I only get called by flushes. Let me bet 5 chips (pot-sized bet).\n\nWait, let me check what the minimum raise is. The minimum raise to is 2, but that's the total amount, which doesn't make sense because the pot is 5. Let me think... actually \"minimum raise to: 2\" probably means I can raise to at least 2 chips total, but that would just be a check since the current bet is 0. \n\nActually, rereading: \"Amount to call: 0\" means it's checked to me.

This is their first raise in the last 15 hands.\n\nI have TT (tens) on the BTN. This is a strong hand, especially against a tight player. I should consider:\n1. 3-betting for value - TT is ahead of a tight player's raising range\n2. The raise size is 8 (4bb), which is standard\n3. I have 102.5bb, plenty deep\n4. I'm on the button, so position is perfect\n\nAgainst a tight player, I should 3-bet to isolate and get value. The minimum raise is to 14, but I should make it larger to:\n- Charge their strong hands\n- Fold out their marginal hands\n- Build a pot with my strong hand\n\nA standard 3-bet size would be 3x their raise, so around 24-30 chips. Given the stack depths, I can go to 30 chips to put pressure on them while still being able to fold if they 4-bet large.\n\nLet me think about what hands a tight player would raise from MP:\n- Premium pairs: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT\n- Strong broadway: AK, AQ, maybe AJs, KQs\n\nMy TT is flipping against AK, AQ and dominated by JJ+, but ahead of everything else. I need to 3-bet for value and see how they react.\n\nIf they 4-bet, I can fold comfortably knowing they likely have JJ+ or AK. If they call, I can play postflop with position.\n\nI'll make a substantial 3-bet to 30 chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket tens (Td Tc) and the flop comes Th 3s Qc, giving me three of a kind (tens). This is a very strong hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have trip tens (three of a kind). The board shows Th 3s Qc. There are no flush or straight draws immediately visible. I have the best possible hand right now unless my opponent has Q-Q (pocket queens) for a higher set.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is excellent position.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Only DeepSeek-V3.2 is still in the hand. Looking at their history:\n   - They've been very tight, folding most preflop hands\n   - They raised preflop to 8 (4 BB), so they likely have a strong hand\n   - They called my 3-bet to 30, indicating real strength\n   - Based on their tight play, they likely have: QQ, AQ, KQ, QJ, or maybe a strong pocket pair like JJ or AA/KK\n\n4. **Pot size**: 62 chips\n   - Preflop: 1 (SB) + 2 (BB) + 8 (raise) + 30 (my 3-bet) + 22 (call) = 63 chips, but shown as 62\n   - My stack: 176 - 30 = 146 chips remaining\n\n5. **Board texture**: Th 3s Qc\n   - I have trip tens\n   - Possible opponent hands:\n     - QQ: They have a set of queens (beating me badly)\n     - AQ: They have top pair top kicker\n     - KQ/QJ: They have top pair\n     - AA/KK: They have an overpair\n     - QT: They have two pair (unlikely given my tens)\n   \n6. **Action**: It's checked to me (amount to call is 0). I should bet for value here.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing:\n- The pot is 62 chips\n- I have 146 chips left\n- I want to get value from top pair hands (AQ, KQ, QJ) and overpairs (AA, KK)\n- I also need to protect against draws (though there aren't many obvious ones)\n- A bet of about 2/3 pot (40-45 chips) seems appropriate\n\nHowever, I should also consider that this opponent is tight. If they have QQ, I'm crushed. But if they have AQ or KQ, I want to get value. Given their tight nature and the fact they called my 3-bet, QQ is definitely in their range, but it's only one hand combination.\n\nThe most likely scenario is they have AQ or KQ and I have the best hand. I should bet for value.\n\nMinimum raise is 22, which would be a very small bet (less than half pot). I should bet more.\n\nLet me bet 45 chips, which is about 72% of pot - a solid value bet that builds the pot while still getting calls from top pair hands.",

Can make straights and flushes. Decent stealing hand on the button.\n\n2. **Position**: Button is excellent position - I get to act last postflop.\n\n3. **Opponents**: SB is very tight (80% fold rate). BB is more defend-y but still folds a fair amount. Both are likely to fold to a raise.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Calling 2 to win 3 = 40% immediate pot odds. Not great for a marginal hand, but position and implied odds help.\n\n5. **Tournament**: With 119 BB, I have a healthy stack. This is a good spot to either:\n   - Steal the blinds with a raise\n   - Call and play a speculative hand in position\n\nGiven that the SB folds 80% of the time and I'm on the button with a suited connector, this is a good spot to raise and try to steal the blinds. A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 6 chips, but since there's already 1 from SB and 2 from BB, raising to 6 total seems appropriate.\n\nIf I raise to 6:\n- SB would need to call 5 more\n- BB would need to call 4 more\n- Both have shown willingness to fold, especially SB\n\nThis is a clear raise situation to try to steal the blinds with a hand that has good potential if called.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent \"Kimi-K2\" is in the big blind (seat 2). Looking at their preflop actions:\n\nThey fold quite often (11 folds out of 19 actions shown), but when they raise, it's consistently to 6 chips (3x the big blind) or 8 chips (4x the big blind). This suggests they have a somewhat tight but aggressive style when they do enter pots.\n\nI have pocket 5s (5c 5s) on the button. This is a decent hand in position. Let me think about the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Pocket 5s is a medium pocket pair. It has good potential to make a set (about 12% chance on the flop) but is vulnerable to overcards.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position postflop.\n3. **Stack size**: I have 238 chips (119 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n4. **Opponent**: The big blind has shown a pattern of folding often but raising to 6-8 when they do play. This suggests they might defend their blind aggressively.\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 1 chip to win a pot of 3 chips, giving me 3:1 odds.\n\nGiven that I'm on the button with a pocket pair and position, and I only need to call 1 chip (0.5 BB) to see the flop, this is an easy call. Raising could also be an option, but with a small pocket pair, I prefer to see a cheap flop and try to hit a set. The opponent seems to fold a lot, but when they raise, they raise big. If I raise to 4 (minimum), they might re-raise to 6 or 8, which would put me in a tough spot with 5s.\n\nI think calling is the best play here. It's cheap, I'm in position, and I have implied odds if I hit my set.\n\nLet me make the call.",

The board shows Q-8-9 rainbow. This is a dangerous board with multiple overcards. I have an underpair to the board.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is favorable position.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Based on the data, Kimi-K2 is very tight and only raises with strong hands. They checked preflop after I called from SB, which suggests they don't have a premium hand, but they could have:\n   - AQ, KQ, QJ (top pair)\n   - JT (straight draw)\n   - 98, 87 (second pair)\n   - Or air that they're willing to check down\n\n4. **Board texture**: Q-8-9 is coordinated. There are straight draws (JT, T7, 76) and the opponent could easily have top pair with a Q.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is only 4 chips. Checking costs me nothing to see the turn.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack of 118.5 BB. I don't need to take unnecessary risks with an underpair on a dangerous board against a tight player.\n\n**Decision**: The opponent checked to me. I have a weak underpair on a board with overcards and potential straight draws. Against a tight player who only raises with strong hands, I should be cautious. The best play here is to check and see a free turn card. If I bet, a tight player will likely only continue with hands that beat me (top pair+, strong draws), and I don't want to build a big pot with such a marginal hand.\n\nBetting would be a bluff, which might work against some opponents, but against a tight player who checked, they might check-call with any Q, any 9, any 8, or a draw. The risk isn't worth the small reward of 4 chips.\n\nI should check and see what develops on the turn.",

The board is Q-8-9-5. There's a possible straight draw (J-T would make a straight), and two clubs on board (Qc and 5h is not a club, wait 5h is hearts). Actually board has Qc, 8d, 9s, 5h - so only Qc is a club.\n\nLet me check opponent actions. The opponent in Seat 2 is \"Kimi-K2\". Looking at their history:\n- They raise preflop quite often (hands 2, 7, 8, 13, 17)\n- They fold a lot preflop too\n- In hand 17, they raised preflop to 6, checked flop, then folded on turn\n\nIn this hand:\n- Preflop: I called from SB (1 chip), opponent checked from BB\n- Flop: I checked, opponent checked\n- Turn: It's on me now\n\nThe opponent checked twice now. This suggests weakness. They could have:\n- Nothing (complete air)\n- A weak pair\n- A draw\n- Maybe a strong hand trying to trap (less likely with two checks)\n\nI have a strong hand - a set. The board is somewhat coordinated with potential straight draws (J-T) and there are two cards to a flush (Qc and... wait, only Qc is a club. 8d, 9s, 5h are not clubs. So only one club).\n\nActually the board is: Qc 8d 9s 5h\n- Only Qc is a club, so no flush draw yet\n- Possible straight draws: J-T would make a straight\n- Possible two-pair combinations\n\nGiven that the opponent checked twice, they're likely weak. I should bet for value with my set. \n\nI need to extract maximum value from my strong hand. A small bet might entice calls from marginal hands while building the pot. The key is finding the right balance between getting paid and not scaring off potential callers. I'll consider a bet around 3-4 chips, which represents a solid value bet that most opponents would find difficult to fold against.\n\nThe board texture suggests potential straight draws, so I'll size my bet to charge those drawing hands. A 4-chip bet seems optimal - it's substantial enough to extract value while still inviting calls from weaker holdings. This approach balances pot-building with hand protection.\n\nMy 237-chip stack provides flexibility, allowing me to make this value bet without risking tournament life. The strategic bet size positions me well for future streets while maximizing potential returns.",

J9s has good potential for straights, flushes, and strong pairs. In position on the button against two relatively tight opponents, this is a profitable call. \n\nRaising could also be an option to try to steal the blinds, but with J9s I prefer to see a flop in position rather than turning this into a bluff preflop. The opponents are tight enough that they may fold to a raise, but calling keeps the pot small and allows me to use my positional advantage postflop.\n\n**Pot odds**: 4 to win 6 = 1.5:1. With a speculative hand like J9s, I don't need immediate pot odds to be huge since I'm playing for implied odds when I hit big.\n\nI'll call and see the flop in position.",

My opponent has checked twice, which could mean:\n- They're weak and want to see a free showdown\n- They have a made flush and are trapping\n- They have a club draw and want to see the river cheaply\n\nGiven that I have almost no equity (just a gutshot), I should not bet here. The only reasonable action is to check and see a free river card. I have position, so I can decide on the river based on what card comes and what my opponent does.\n\nBetting would be a pure bluff, and with this board texture (4 clubs), it's unlikely to succeed often enough to be profitable. My opponent could easily have a club and call, or they might check-raise with a made hand.\n\nI should check behind and see the river for free.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have 9d Jd (jack-high). The board is 8h 3c 5c 6c Kc. There are four clubs on the board, so a flush is possible. I have no clubs in my hand. My best hand is just jack-high with a 9 kicker. This is extremely weak.\n\n2. **Opponent behavior**: DeepSeek-V3.2 has been checking throughout this hand. Based on the recall data, this player has shown:\n   - They've been relatively tight (folding preflop many times)\n   - In hand 15, they raised preflop but folded on the flop\n   - In hand 17, they called preflop, checked flop, then bet on the turn\n   - In hand 18, they called preflop and bet on the flop\n   - In hand 11, they bet on the river\n\n   They seem capable of betting when they have something, but they also check-fold in many spots.\n\n3. **Board texture**: Four clubs on board means any club beats me. Also any pair beats me. This is a terrible board for my hand.\n\n4. **Pot size**: Only 10 chips. Very small pot.\n\n5. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good, but my hand is just too weak.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 237 chips (59.2 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to risk chips here.\n\nThe opponent has checked to me on the river. I have a pure bluff catcher at best (jack-high). Given that there are four clubs on board and my opponent has been passive, they could have:\n- A club (any club beats me)\n- Any pair (beats me)\n- Complete air (I might win)\n\nHowever, the fact that they've checked the river after checking flop and turn suggests they don't have a strong hand. They could be trying to get to showdown cheaply with a weak made hand.\n\nGiven my complete lack of showdown value and the fact that any club or any pair beats me, I should not try to bluff here. The opponent has shown they can call or bet in some spots, and this is a tournament where I don't want to spew chips.\n\nI should check back and hope my jack-high is good, but I'm not going to invest any more chips into this pot. The risk of being called by any pair or any club is too high, and I have no equity if called.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. Since they've checked to me and I've shown weakness throughout (checking flop and turn), I could potentially represent the flush. But this is risky because:\n1. The pot is tiny (10 chips)\n2. I have no blockers to the flush\n3. My opponent could easily have a club\n4. Tournament chips are valuable\n\nI think the correct play is to check back. The risk/reward of bluffing here is not favorable.",

Playing a weak hand from this position is very dangerous.\n\n**Opponent Information:**\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Posted SB, showed one preflop raise in hand #15. In hand #21 they showed down A-2o, suggesting they might play a wide range.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Posted BB, no preflop raises found. Showed down K-4o in hand #3, also suggesting a potentially wide range.\n\nEven though both opponents in the blinds seem to play wide ranges, my hand is simply too weak to play from UTG. The risk of running into a strong hand from any of the 3-4 players behind me is too high.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nPot is 6, need to call 4, so getting 1.5:1 odds.

It's suited which gives some potential, but it's easily dominated by better Qx or 5x hands. From early position, we need a much stronger range.\n\n**Position:**\nUTG is the worst position. If I call or raise, I'll have 4 players acting after me who could have much stronger hands.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall, I see:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been folding a lot preflop\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) made a raise in hand 19\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) made a raise in hand 22\n- Generally tight play from opponents\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWith 59.2 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots, especially from UTG. Preserving chips is important.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. Q5s is too weak to play from UTG, even with the suited aspect. I could be dominated by so many hands (AQ, KQ, QJ, QT, any pocket pair, etc.). The potential upside of hitting a flush or two pair doesn't justify the risk from this position.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** 8s 6d\n**Board:** 5d 5h 3h\n**Position:** BTN (Button)\n**Stack:** 233 chips (58.2 BB)\n**Pot:** 8 chips\n**Opponent:** GPT-OSS-120B in SB position, checked to me\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have 8-high with no pair, no draw\n- The board is paired (5-5-3) with two hearts\n- I have absolutely nothing - just 8-high\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at the recall data for GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5):\n- Very tight player, folds preflop frequently\n- When they do play, they tend to check-fold on the flop\n- In hand 23, they called preflop then check-folded on flop\n- In hand 18, they checked then folded on flop\n- In hand 12, they raised preflop, called a raise, then check-folded flop\n- Only showdown shows they had 2s 5s (made trips on that board)\n\nThis opponent is clearly very tight and passive. The fact they checked on this flop suggests weakness.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the button, which is great position. I have the advantage of acting last.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 8 chips, I can check for free. If I bet, minimum raise is 4 chips.\n\n**Decision:** I have absolutely no hand (8-high). However, I have position and my opponent has shown a pattern of being very tight and giving up on flops. This is a good spot for a continuation bet/bluff since:\n1. I checked preflop as BB, opponent just called as SB\n2. The flop is paired (5-5-3) which is scary and hard to hit\n3. Opponent checked to me showing weakness\n4. I have position\n5. Opponent's history shows they frequently fold to flop bets\n\nHowever, I need to consider that my hand is COMPLETE air. I have no equity, no draw, nothing. While a bluff might work, I'm risking chips with zero chance of winning if called.\n\nGiven that it's a tournament and I have a healthy stack (58 BB), but also considering my opponent's tight nature, I think a small bluff could be profitable. But checking is also fine - I have no hand and can give up.\n\nLet me think about sizing. Minimum raise is 4 chips (to 4 total). A standard c-bet would be about 50-75% of pot, so 4-6 chips. Since the pot is 8, a bet of 4-6 chips makes sense.\n\nActually, wait - the minimum raise to is 4, which means I can raise TO 4 chips total (so bet 4 chips). That's a half-pot bet, which is reasonable.\n\nGiven my opponent's tight pattern and the fact that this board is hard to hit, I think a small bluff is profitable here. But I should keep it small since I have no equity.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have 8-high complete air. While my opponent is tight, bluffing with absolutely nothing is risky. Checking and giving up is also a reasonable play. The fact that they just called preflop from SB and checked flop suggests they might have some piece of this board or are trapping. \n\nBut their pattern is very convincing - they check-fold flops a lot. I think a small stab is worth it. I'll bet the minimum (4 chips) as a bluff.\n\nWait, let me think one more time. I have:\n- 8-high, no draw\n- Position\n- Tight opponent who check-folds a lot\n- Paired board that's scary\n\nThe conservative play is to check and give up. The aggressive play is to bet small as a bluff.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and that I have a healthy stack, I think taking a small +EV bluff is fine. But actually, with absolutely zero equity, I might just want to check and preserve chips.\n\nYou know what, I think checking is the better play here. I have literally nothing, and while the opponent is tight, bluffing with 8-high is just burning chips in many cases. Let me check and see what happens on the turn. If they check again, I might consider bluffing then.\n\nActually, the board is paired which is good for bluffing, and my opponent's stats are very compelling. Let me make a small stab. I'll bet 4 chips.\n\nNo wait - I should be more conservative. With 8-high and no draw, I should just check. I can bluff later if the opponent shows more weakness. Checking is free and preserves my equity.\n\nFinal decision: Check.",

There's no reason to bet as a bluff because:\n- The opponent likely has a weak hand but might call a small bet\n- I don't need to protect my hand (I have a draw, not a made hand)\n- I want to see the river card for free if possible\n- If I hit my straight on the river, I can potentially extract value from this passive opponent\n\nThe best play is to check and see a free river card.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have an open-ended straight draw with 8 outs.

Let me re-evaluate the board: 5d 5h 3h 7s 4h\nBoard cards: 3, 4, 5, 5, 7\n\nMy hand: 8s 6d (6, 8)\n\nSo my best 5-card hand would be: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 = Straight (7-high)\n\n\nI notice a potential vulnerability in my hand. If an opponent holds 8, they could make an 8-high straight with 4-5-6-7-8. This means my current straight might be at risk. The board's paired 5s add another layer of complexity, potentially allowing for full house or quad combinations. I need to carefully consider the betting action and potential hand ranges of my opponents.\n\nThe betting pattern seems suspicious. A small 8-chip bet into a 16-chip pot suggests either a weak hand or a potential trap. I'm getting 3-to-1 pot odds, which makes calling mathematically attractive. However, the potential for being outdrawn keeps me cautious.\n\nMy stack of 233 chips gives me flexibility, but I must stay alert to potential stronger hands. The straight looks solid, but poker always has surprises lurking beneath the surface.\n\nI need to carefully consider the potential hand ranges. With a paired board and possible straight draws, my opponent might be holding something tricky. The small bet could indicate weakness or a subtle trap. I'll need to weigh the pot odds against the risk of being outdrawn.\n\nMy stack size provides some strategic room, but I'll want to minimize potential losses if my opponent has a superior hand. A defensive play seems most prudent right now.\n\nThe pot odds are attractive at 3:1, and my straight looks reasonably strong. However, the paired board and potential higher straight combinations make me cautious. I'll call and see the showdown, keeping my risk relatively low while maintaining the potential to win a decent pot.\n\nMy opponent's betting pattern suggests possible weakness or a marginal hand. The small bet size might indicate they're testing the waters or trying to extract thin value. I'll match their bet and observe their reaction, which could reveal more about their hand strength.\n\nWith pot odds of 3:1 and a made straight, calling seems like the most prudent move. I want to see a cheap showdown without unnecessarily inflating the pot, especially given the potential for a stronger hand on the paired board.",

The preflop raise to 12 was likely a strong hand (maybe 88+, AJ+).\n\n**Position & Stack considerations:**\n- I have 237 chips (59 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot is 28 chips\n- I can check and see a free card with my overcards\n\n**Decision:**\nChecking is the clear best option here because:\n1. I have no made hand, just overcards\n2. The board is relatively dry (no flush/straight draws for me)\n3. My opponent showed strength preflop\n4. I have position (I act after them on future streets)\n5. Getting a free card to hit my K or J is valuable\n6. No need to build a pot with a weak hand\n\nI should definitely not raise here - that would be a pure bluff on a board that likely hit my opponent's raising range.\n\nI'll check and see what happens on the turn.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: Jc Ks (King-Jack offsuit)\n- Position: BB (out of position)\n- Stack: 237 chips (59.2 BB) - healthy stack\n- Board: Ts 7h 3c\n- Pot: 40 chips\n- Opponent bet: 12 chips\n- I need to call 12 chips\n\n**Hand strength:**\nI have King-high with no pair. The board is Ts 7h 3c. I have:\n- No pair\n- No flush draw (one club)\n- No straight draw (need Q and 9, or A and Q - not possible)\n- Two overcards to the board (K and J)\n\n**Opponent info:**\n- GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively passive based on the recall data\n- They've folded preflop several times\n- When they do play, they tend to check-fold on flops\n- In hand 24, they did bet 8 on the river after checking flop and turn\n- They raised preflop to 12 in this hand, which is a strong action from them\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 40 chips, need to call 12\n- Getting 40:12 or about 3.33:1 odds\n- Need ~23% equity to break even on a call\n\n**Equity consideration:**\nWith KJ on T-7-3 rainbow board:\n- Against a pair of Tens: ~24% equity (6 outs - 3 Kings + 3 Jacks)\n- Against a pair of 7s or 3s: ~24% equity\n- Against two pair: ~13% equity\n- Against a set: ~7% equity\n- Against AK/AQ: ~28% equity (if they missed)\n\nThe roughly 24% equity against most made hands is close to the required 23% break-even point. However, this assumes we get to see both turn and river, which we might not if opponent bets again.\n\n**Position and future streets:**\n- I'm out of position, which is bad\n- If I call and miss the turn, I'll face another bet\n- Opponent has 140 chips left (35 BB), so they can apply pressure\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (59 BB)\n- Don't need to take marginal spots\n- Better spots will come\n\n**Opponent's range:**\nThey raised preflop from Seat 5, which is a middle position. They could have:\n- Pocket pairs (TT+ would be strong, but 22-99 also possible)\n- Broadways (AT+, KJ+, QJ+)\n- Some suited connectors\n\nGiven the board Ts 7h 3c and their flop bet of 12 into 40 (30% pot), they likely have:\n- A pair (T with good kicker, 77, 33)\n- Overpair (JJ+)\n- Possibly just continuation betting with air\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a marginal spot. I have 6 clean outs (3 Kings, 3 Jacks). The pot odds are barely sufficient, but:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. I have to dodge turn bets if I miss\n3. Opponent's preflop raise suggests strength\n4. I have a healthy stack and can wait for better spots\n\nI think folding is the best play here. The combination of being out of position, having a marginal hand with limited equity, and opponent showing strength preflop makes this a fold. I can preserve my chips for better spots where I have initiative or better equity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Good, I have some information about the opponents:\n\n**Kimi-K2 (SB, Seat 2):**\n- Very tight player - mostly folding preflop (folded in 8 of last 10 hands)\n- Only raised once (hand #22) and checked once when they could\n- Not very aggressive\n\n**DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB, Seat 3):**\n- Also tight but slightly more active than SB\n- Folded 6 of last 10 hands preflop\n- Raised once (hand #23) and followed up with a flop bet\n- From hand #21, I can see they defended BB with As2d (a weak ace) and checked it down\n- Seems to play straightforward\n\n**My situation:**\n- Position: BTN (best position)\n- Cards: Ah Th (ace-ten suited) - This is a strong hand on the button\n- Stack: 237 chips (59.2 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot: 6 chips (1.5 BB)\n- Need to call 4 chips to see flop\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Ah Th is a very good hand, especially on the button. It's suited, has an ace, and good straight potential.\n2. **Position**: BTN is the best position - I act last on every street.\n3. **Opponents**: Both blinds are tight players who fold a lot. The SB folds ~80% of the time, BB folds ~60% of the time.\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 59 BB, I have a comfortable stack. I should be looking to accumulate chips against tight opponents.\n\nGiven that both opponents are tight and I'm on the button with a strong suited ace, I should raise here. A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 12 chips, but since there's already a SB posted, I should raise to about 3-3.5x total.\n\nMinimum raise is 8, but that's too small. I want to:\n1. Get value from my strong hand\n2. Apply pressure to tight opponents\n3. Build the pot when I have position and a good hand\n\nA raise to 12-16 chips seems appropriate. I'll go with 12 chips (3x BB) as a standard sizing that should be enough to pressure the tight blinds but not too large to risk too many chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With both players being tight, I could raise a bit larger to really put pressure on them. A raise to 14-16 chips would be good. I'll go with 14 chips to keep it reasonable but apply maximum pressure.\n\nWait, looking at the pattern again - both opponents fold a lot to raises. The BB did raise once and then bet the flop, showing they can be aggressive with strong hands. But overall, they're tight.\n\nWith Ah Th on the button, this is definitely a raising hand. I'll raise to 14 chips to:\n1. Build the pot with my strong hand\n2. Apply pressure to tight opponents\n3. Take control of the hand with position\n4. Potentially win the pot preflop (which is fine too)\n\n14 chips is about 3.5x BB, which is a solid standard raise size.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 5s 6h (suited connectors but not suited to each other)\n**Position:** UTG (worst position)\n**Stack:** 243 chips (60.8 BB) - decent stack\n**Blinds:** 2/4\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Very tight player. 7 folds out of 10 actions, only raised once. Seems to play very selectively.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Mixed player. Has shown aggression with raises, but also folds frequently. They posted SB this hand.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Very tight player. Folded 9 out of 10 times preflop. Only called once then folded.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:** 56o from UTG is a very weak hand. I should almost always fold this from early position. \n- No pair, no high cards\n- Not suited\n- Low connectors that rarely make strong hands\n- From UTG, I have 7 players left to act behind me\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** \n- I have a healthy stack (60.8 BB)\n- No need to take risks with marginal hands\n- Early position requires premium hands\n- The players behind me include tight players who will likely fold unless they have strong hands, but I can't rely on that\n\n**Pot odds:** Need to call 4 chips to win 6 chips = 1.5:1. This is not enough to justify playing this weak hand.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an easy fold. 56o from UTG is not a playable hand, especially with a healthy stack. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

This is a clear fold in almost all situations.\n\n2. **Position:** UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act on all postflop streets with 4 players still to act behind me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** The table seems relatively tight based on the folding patterns, but Seat 5 has shown aggression. This makes playing a weak hand even more dangerous.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations:** With 60+ BB, I have a healthy stack. No need to risk chips with such a weak hand from bad position. Preserving my stack for better spots is key.\n\n5. **Pot odds:** 4 chips to win 6 chips = 1.5:1 pot odds, which is not nearly enough to justify playing this hand.\n\n**Decision:** Clear fold.

However, with 7c 3c, position doesn't help much with such a weak hand.\n\n**Stack**: 243 chips (60.8 BB) - Healthy stack, no need to take risks.\n\n**Current Action**:\n- SB posted 2\n- BB posted 4\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called 8\n\n**Pot**: 22 chips\n**To call**: 8 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis**:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has folded preflop in the last 10 hands consecutively! This is a very tight player. The fact that they're raising now suggests they have a strong hand.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): More active. They raised in hand 25 and 30, and showed down 8d 7s in hand 30. They seem to be a looser, more aggressive player.\n\n**Pot Odds**: 8 to win 22 = 2.75:1, which is about 36.4% equity needed to call. Even with position, 7c 3c has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. \n- My hand is extremely weak (7-3 offsuit)\n- There's been a raise from a very tight player (Seat 4 who has folded 10 straight hands)\n- There's also a caller (Seat 5)\n- I'm risking 8 chips (3.3% of my stack) with a hand that will rarely hit and is difficult to play postflop\n- Even on the button, this hand is not worth playing in a raised pot\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

That's 12/(18+12) = 12/30 = 40% equity needed.\n\n**Hand equity**: 9s 3d has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a very wide range, this hand is a clear fold.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 60 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nEven though the opponent might be raising wide, 9s 3d is just too weak to call. I should fold.\n\nLet me think about raising as a bluff: \n- I could raise to 20 (minimum)\n- But I'm out of position relative to the button and blinds\n- My hand has no playability postflop\n- It's not worth the risk with a marginal bluffing hand\n\nDecision: **Fold**",

K4s is not a playable hand from UTG position, even with the suited connector potential. The risk of being dominated, the poor position, and the availability of better spots all point to folding.\n\nI don't need to search for more specific opponent information - the hand is weak enough that it's a clear fold regardless of opponent tendencies.",

The combination of poor card quality, tight opponent, and unfavorable pot odds makes this an easy decision.

They limped once and folded on flop. They seem straightforward and not overly aggressive postflop.\n\n**Hand strength**: K8o is a marginal hand, especially from SB. It's dominated by many hands (any K with better kicker, any pair). \n\n**Position**: SB is terrible postflop - I'll be first to act on every street.\n\n**Pot odds**: I'm getting 5:1 to call (call 2 to win 10), which is attractive, but I need to consider reverse implied odds - when I hit my King, I could lose a lot if opponent has a better kicker.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 59 BB, I have a comfortable stack. I don't need to take marginal spots. The opponent seems straightforward and likely has a hand they're willing to play given they called from CO.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. K8o is too weak from SB, especially with position disadvantage and risk of being dominated.

Has folded preflop many times, only checked in one hand (hand 30) and folded on flop. Showed down Ts6s in hand 30 which is a weak hand. Seems to play very few hands.\n- Seat 3 (BB - DeepSeek-V3.2): Also tight but occasionally raises. Has folded many times preflop but raised to 12 in hand 28 and 14 in hand 34. Showed down As2d in hand 21.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- Pocket 4s is a decent but not strong hand\n- On the button, this is a good position to see a flop\n- I'm getting good odds to call (4 to win 6, or 1.5:1)\n- If I raise, I might fold out the SB who is very tight\n- The BB has shown they can raise, so there's some risk\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- I'm relatively deep stacked at 59 BB\n- The SB is very tight and likely to fold to pressure\n- The BB is also tight but capable of raising\n- Pocket pairs like 4s want to see cheap flops to hit sets\n- Raising might isolate me against stronger hands\n- Calling gives me good implied odds if I hit a set\n\n**Decision:** I should call. Pocket 4s plays well in position on the button. The call is cheap (4 chips), and I have good implied odds if I hit my set. Both opponents seem tight, so I'm unlikely to face aggression unless they have strong hands. Raising would be overplaying this hand and could fold out worse hands while getting called/raised by better ones.\n\nLet me make the call.",

I can check or raise.\n\n**Hand analysis**: I have pocket fours on a board with J-A-8-9. This is a very wet board with straight draws (Q-T, T-7) and potential flush draws (diamonds). My fours are very weak here. I have no pair (the board has overcards), no draw, and only two outs to improve to a set on the river.\n\n**Opponent analysis**: DeepSeek-V3.2 has been quite tight based on their recent actions. Looking at the data:\n- They've folded preflop many times (hands 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35)\n- They've raised preflop a few times (hands 23, 28, 34)\n- In hand 21, they checked down all streets\n- In hand 23, they raised preflop and bet on the flop\n\nThis suggests they're a relatively tight player who doesn't get to showdown often and tends to fold when they don't have strong hands.\n\n**Action**: The opponent has checked to me on the turn. This could mean:\n1. They have a weak hand and want to see a free river\n2. They have a marginal hand and are pot-controlling\n3. They have a strong hand and are trying to trap\n\nGiven the wet board (J-A-8-9 with two diamonds), if they had a strong hand like top pair, two pair, or a straight, they would likely be betting for value and protection.\n\n**My decision**: I have absolutely nothing with my pocket fours. \n\nI see two potential paths forward. Checking allows me to see the river without risking additional chips, which seems prudent given my weak hand. The pot is currently small, and I have no compelling reason to inflate it with such a marginal holding. \n\nA bluff could potentially work against this tight opponent, but the risk seems unnecessary. I'll conserve my chips and check through to the river, hoping for a miracle four to improve my hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The hand has reached the river with a board of Jd As 8h 9d 5h. I have pocket 4s (4s 4h), which is a weak hand on this board. Let me analyze:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have pocket 4s. The board shows Jd As 8h 9d 5h. I have no pair, no draw, and no real hand. My best hand is Ace-high, but that's not strong given the action.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position, but that doesn't matter much when I have no hand.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: The pot is 10 chips and I can check for free. There would need to be a very compelling reason to bet here.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's actions, they've been very passive - lots of folding and checking. They've only raised a few times preflop (hands 23, 28, 34) but then didn't show much aggression postflop. In hand 23, they raised preflop to 8 and bet 8 on the flop, but in hand 34 they raised to 14 preflop. They seem to be playing a tight, passive style.\n\n5. **The action**: Everyone checked on every street. This suggests weakness from all players. DeepSeek-V3.2 checked the river, giving me the option to check or bet.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 233 chips (58.2 BB), I have a healthy stack. Betting here would be a pure bluff. Given that everyone has shown weakness by checking through, a small bluff might work, but it's risky with no equity.\n\n7. **Bluffing opportunity**: Since everyone has checked through, I could represent a strong hand with a small bet. However, DeepSeek-V3.2 has shown they can call or raise preflop with decent hands. The board is somewhat connected (J-8-9-5 with an Ace) which could hit many hands.\n\nGiven that I have absolutely no hand (just 44 on a board with an Ace, Jack, 9, 8, 5), and all the checking suggests weakness, I have two options:\n\n\nI'll take the conservative approach and check. With no hand and multiple opponents showing weakness, checking minimizes risk. While a bluff might seem tempting, the lack of any real hand strength makes it too dangerous. Checking allows me to see the showdown without investing more chips, which is the most prudent move in this tournament situation.",

Q7o is a fold in early position in almost all situations.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table, I have to act first on every street. I need a very strong hand to play from here.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 243 chips (60.8 BB) - I have a healthy stack, no need to take risks.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: Looking at my hand history, I have a 24.3% win rate with 27 folds and only 9 wins out of 37 hands. This suggests I've been playing tight, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: From the search results, I can see:\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 has made preflop raises (hands 23, 28, 34)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has made preflop raises (hands 25, 30, 32)\n   - MiniMax-M2 has made preflop raises (hands 31)\n   - My clone (Kimi-K2) has also made raises (hands 27)\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 6, which is 1.5:1. Even with these odds, Q7o is too weak from UTG.\n\n7. **My recent hands**: I've been folding a lot, especially from early position (hands 28, 33, 37 were all folds from early/mid positions). This is disciplined play.\n\nWith Q7 offsuit from UTG, this is a clear fold. The hand has poor equity, I'm out of position, and I have no reason to risk chips with such a marginal holding. Even if the table is playing tight, I should wait for a better spot.\n\nThe correct play is to fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have K\u2660 Q\u2660 in the BB - a very strong suited broadway hand\n- I'm out of position against one opponent (MiniMax-M2) who just called the BB\n- Pot is 10 chips (4 from me, 4 from MiniMax, 2 from SB)\n- I can check or raise\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nMiniMax-M2 has been very tight recently:\n- Hands 35-38: Folded preflop every time\n- Hand 33: Called 2 chips (minimum), then bet 6 on flop\n- Hand 32: Folded preflop\n- Hand 31: Raised to 8 preflop, then bet 14 on flop\n\nSo when they do enter a pot, they can be aggressive. The call from the CO (seat 4) suggests a medium strength hand - maybe suited connectors, small pairs, or broadway cards. They didn't raise, which is good for me.\n\n**Position and Stack:**\n- I'm out of position (BB) with 239 chips (59.8 BB)\n- MiniMax has 182 chips (45.5 BB)\n- We're relatively deep stacked\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nKQs is a premium hand, especially suited. It plays very well postflop with potential for:\n- Top pair good kicker\n- Flush draws\n- Straight draws\n- Nut flushes\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear check situation. Here's why:\n1. I'm out of position - checking keeps the pot small and allows me to see the flop cheaply\n2. KQs plays very well postflop - I want to see a flop with this hand\n3. MiniMax is tight and called rather than raised - they likely have a decent but not premium hand\n4. No need to bloat the pot preflop out of position\n5. If I raise, I might fold out weaker hands and only get action from hands that dominate me (AA, KK, QQ, AK)\n\nThe EV is higher by checking and seeing a flop with my suited connectors.",

KJo from SB against a tight raiser and a caller is a marginal spot at best. The raiser's tight pattern suggests real strength, and I'll be out of position postflop. With a healthy stack of 61.8 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots like this. \n\nI could consider a squeeze raise, but that would commit too many chips with a hand that plays poorly postflop when called. The risk/reward isn't favorable here.\n\n**Decision**: Fold",

T3s from UTG is a trash hand that should never be played in this position. The risk of running into a much better hand is extremely high, and even if we hit a flush or straight, we won't often get paid off enough to justify the preflop investment.\n\nThe math is simple: we have to put in 8 chips to win 12 (1.5:1 pot odds), but our hand equity is likely less than 20% against any reasonable range of hands that would call or raise us.",

It's offsuit and the cards aren't coordinated well enough to make strong draws or straights. This is a clear fold in early position.\n\n**Position consideration:**\nI'm UTG (Under the Gun), which is the worst position preflop. I have to act first and will be out of position for the entire hand. This means I should only play premium hands from this position.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall, I can see:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising preflop in hands 41 and 42 (24 chips each time)\n- MiniMax-M2 has made some calls and raises\n- GPT-OSS-120B has been calling and folding\n- Generally seems like players are active\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nWith 30.9 BB, I have a workable stack. I don't need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands from bad position. Tournament survival and chip preservation are important.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n8\u2666 7\u2665 from UTG is a clear fold.

K9o is marginal, especially OOP\n2. MiniMax-M2 is tight - calling 1 BB suggests some strength\n3. I'm out of position - will be difficult to play postflop\n4. I have a decent stack and don't need to take marginal spots\n5. No dead money to fight for (only 1 caller)\n\nI should check and see a flop. Raising would be spewy with this hand against a tight opponent. Folding is too tight since I'm getting a free flop.\n\nLet me check.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 9d Kh\n**Board**: 4d 4s 9h\n**Position**: BB (out of position)\n**Stack**: 239 chips (29.9 BB)\n**Pot**: 20 chips\n\nI have a pair of 9s with a King kicker. The board has a pair of 4s, so I have two pair (9s and 4s) with a King kicker. This is a strong hand, though the board is paired which can be concerning.\n\n**Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 is in Seat 4 with 180 chips (22.5 BB). Let me analyze their tendencies:\n- They have been folding a lot preflop (many folds, some calls and occasional raises)\n- When they do play, they tend to bet on the flop (hands 31, 33, 40)\n- They seem to be a fairly tight player who bets when they have something\n\n**Current action**: It's checked to me on the flop. I can check or bet.\n\n**My options**:\n1. Check - Let them potentially bet with a weaker hand, or see a free card\n2. Bet - Protect my hand, get value from draws or weaker pairs\n\nGiven that I have two pair (9s and 4s), this is a strong hand on this board. However, there are some concerns:\n- The board is paired, which means someone could have a 4 (trip 4s) or a full house\n- There are potential straight draws (3-5, 5-6, etc.) and flush draws (two diamonds on board)\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2's tendency to bet on the flop when they play, I should consider:\n- If I check, they might bet with weaker hands like pocket pairs, draws, or even air\n- If I bet, I can protect my hand and get value from weaker hands\n\nWith my stack size (29.9 BB), I have room to play. The pot is 20 chips. A standard bet would be around 50-70% of pot, so 10-14 chips.\n\nI think betting is the better option here. I have a strong hand and should:\n1. Protect against draws\n\n\n2. Extract value from weaker hands that might call\n3. Take control of the hand\n\nA strategic 12-chip bet (60% of pot) could effectively pressure opponents. This bet size communicates strength while keeping my options open. It might induce folds from marginal hands and potentially extract value from those holding weaker pairs or drawing hands. The bet protects my two-pair hand and maintains my aggressive posture in the tournament.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 5d 2h (very weak hand, 5-2 offsuit)\n- Position: BTN (Button) - best position\n- Stack: 255 chips (31.9 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- To call: 4 chips\n- Minimum raise: 16 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (BB): Kimi-K2 with 216 chips\n- From the recall data, this opponent has been:\n  - Raising preflop in hands 37 (10), 41 (24), and 42 (24)\n  - Folding preflop in hands 38, 39, 40, 43, and 44\n  - In hand 37, they raised, checked flop, then folded turn\n  - Showdown: Hand 30 with Ts6s (a speculative hand)\n\nThis opponent appears to be somewhat tight-aggressive, raising with decent hands but also folding frequently. The raises of 24 chips (3 BB) in hands 41 and 42 suggest they're playing solid hands.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n5d 2h is one of the worst starting hands in poker. It has almost no potential to make strong hands. The only real value would be if it hits a straight (very unlikely) or we bluff successfully.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm on the button, which is great, but even position can't overcome such a terrible hand.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nI need to call 4 chips to win 12 chips = 3:1 pot odds. This is technically sufficient for any hand, but with 5-2 offsuit, even these odds aren't attractive.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 31.9 BB\n- This is a tournament, so preserving chips is important\n- I could try a steal raise from the button since everyone folded, but:\n  - The BB has shown they defend with raises\n  - My hand is too weak to continue if called or raised\n  - Risking 16 chips (2 BB) to steal 12 chips isn't a great risk/reward\n  - The BB has 27 BB, so they can easily defend\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best play is to fold. 5-2 offsuit is simply too weak to play, even from the button. The opponent in the BB has shown they defend their blind and can raise. Calling would be throwing away 4 chips with a hand that will almost never win. Raising as a steal is too risky with this hand strength and opponent tendencies.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

I act last postflop.\n\n**Stack sizes**: I have 31.9 BB, which is comfortable. Both opponents have similar or smaller stacks.\n\n**Pot odds**: 8 to win 12 = 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed to call. KTo is definitely worth that.\n\n**Decision**:\nGiven that:\n1. I'm on the button with position\n2. KTo is a decent hand, especially for stealing\n3. The BB (Seat 3) has folded 9 hands in a row preflop - extremely tight\n4. The SB (Seat 2) has been somewhat active but also folds frequently\n5. I have a healthy stack\n\nThis is a clear raise situation. I should try to steal the blinds. A standard raise would be 3x the big blind, so 24 chips. Since the minimum raise is 16, I can raise to 24.\n\nGiven the BB's extreme tightness (folding 9 straight hands), there's a very high chance they fold to a raise. The SB has shown they can fold as well.\n\nI should raise to 24 chips to:\n1. Try to steal the blinds\n2. Build the pot if called with my decent hand\n3. Maintain pressure with position\n\nIf I get called, I have position and a hand that can hit top pair with a good kicker.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"On the button with KTo, facing a very tight BB who has folded 9 straight hands preflop.

I have:\n\n- 46 total hands played\n- 33 folds (71.7% fold rate)\n- 12 wins (26% win rate when I play)\n- Only 1 win from UTG position (Qc 7s folded)\n\nMy current hand is Qc 5c from UTG position. Let me analyze:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Qc 5c is a weak hand. It's suited, which gives some potential for a flush, but the kicker (5) is very low. This is not a strong starting hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in UTG (Under the Gun), which is the worst position preflop. I have 7 players behind me who could all have stronger hands.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 267 chips, which is 33.4 BB. This is a decent stack, but I should be careful not to bleed chips with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With blinds at 4/8, the tournament is getting more expensive. I need to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n5. **My recent play**: Looking at my last 10 hands, I've been folding most hands. I did win hand #46 with Kd Th on the button by raising to 24. But from UTG, I should be much tighter.\n\nFrom UTG position, standard poker strategy suggests playing only premium hands (AA, KK, QQ, AK, AQ, AJ suited, KQ suited, etc.). Q5 suited is definitely not in this range.\n\nEven though it's suited, the low kicker makes this hand very vulnerable. If I hit a Q on the flop, I'll often be dominated by hands like AQ, KQ, QJ. If I hit a flush, it will be a low flush that could be beaten by higher flushes.\n\nThe call is 8 chips, which is about 3% of my stack. While this isn't a huge investment, it's still chips I should preserve for better opportunities.\n\nGiven my tight image and the fact that I'm in early position with a weak hand, I should fold.",

They raised to 16 (2x the BB) which is a small raise. Given their tight nature, they're likely doing this with a wide range since everyone folded to them.\n\n**My hand**: T8s is actually a decent defending hand against a steal. I have position and a suited connector that can flop well.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, so 3:1 pot odds. This is good enough to call with a speculative hand.\n\n**Stack considerations**: Calling 8 chips is only 3% of my stack, so very low risk. If I raise, I'd be raising to at least 24 which is about 9% of my stack.\n\n**Decision**: I should call. I have position, decent pot odds, and a hand that can flop well. I don't want to raise because:\n1. I'm behind their raising range most of the time\n2. I want to see a flop in position with this speculative hand\n\n\n3. A raise would commit more chips unnecessarily\n\nI'll play this cautiously, using my position to gather more information on the flop.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** Td 8d (Ten of diamonds, Eight of diamonds)\n**Position:** BTN (Button)\n**Stack:** 251 chips (31.4 BB)\n**Board:** 2h Jc Tc (Two of hearts, Jack of clubs, Ten of clubs)\n**Pot:** 32 chips\n**Opponent:** GPT-OSS-120B in SB with 116 chips\n\n**Preflop action:**\n- I posted BB (8 chips)\n- GPT-OSS-120B raised to 16 (from SB)\n- I called 8 more (total 16)\n\n**Flop action:**\n- GPT-OSS-120B checked\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (he checked)\n- I can check or raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have middle pair with Td 8d. The board is 2h Jc Tc.\n- I have a pair of tens (second pair)\n- There's a flush draw on board (2 clubs)\n- There's a straight draw possibility (Q-9, K-Q)\n- My kicker is weak (8)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw with the Td\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's actions:\n- They frequently fold preflop (hands 34, 36, 37, 39, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48)\n- When they do play, they often fold on the flop (hands 31, 33, 40)\n- They occasionally bet on flop (hand 35: bet 12 after calling preflop)\n- They raised preflop in hand 32\n- They called preflop in hands 35, 40, 41\n\nPattern: This opponent is relatively tight/passive. They fold a lot, especially postflop. When they check on the flop, they might be weak or giving up.\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check: Take a free card, see if I improve. Risk giving free card to opponent.\n2. Bet: Protect my hand, get value from worse hands, charge draws.\n\n**Considerations:**\n- I have a decent made hand (middle pair)\n- The board is somewhat coordinated (flush draw, straight possibilities)\n- My opponent checked, showing weakness\n- I have position (on the button)\n- Pot is 32 chips\n- Opponent has 100 chips behind (started with 116, put in 16 preflop)\n\nI think a bet here is good. I can:\n1. Protect against draws\n2. Get value from weaker hands\n3. Take down the pot now\n4. Build the pot if I'm ahead\n\nSizing: The pot is 32. A bet of 16-24 (50-75% pot) seems reasonable. Since the minimum raise is 8, and that's too small, I should bet more. Let me bet around 20-24.\n\nGiven the coordinated board and my vulnerable hand, I should bet for protection and value. I'll bet 24 (75% of pot) to charge draws and get value from weaker pairs.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The minimum raise is 8, which means I can bet as little as 8, but that's too small. I want to bet an amount that makes sense. Let me bet 20, which is about 62.5% of pot. This is a good size for protection.\n\nLooking at the legal actions again: \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this means the minimum TOTAL bet is 8, but I should bet more. Let me go with 20.",

I should fold this hand and preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nI don't have specific opponent history, but the default play here is to fold this weak hand from the SB facing a raise.\n\nDecision: Fold",

In hand 50, they raised to 60 then to 164, showing they can make big raises. They showed down Ts6s (weak hand) and ThTs (pocket tens).\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Very tight! Has folded preflop almost every hand. Only raised once in hand 48. They showed down As2d and 2d2c, suggesting they play very tight ranges.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: T8 offsuit is a marginal hand. It's not strong, but it has some playability, especially in position.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position. I'll act last post-flop.\n3. **Opponents**: SB seems moderately active, BB is extremely tight.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 12 (1.5:1), which is 40% equity needed. T8o doesn't have that against typical raising ranges, but...\n5. **Implied odds**: With position and the tight BB, I might get folds post-flop or extract value when I hit.\n6. **Stack sizes**: Both opponents have decent stacks. No immediate pressure.\n\n**Decision**: This is a close spot. T8o is marginal but being on the button against what appears to be a tight BB makes this a borderline call. The SB hasn't raised yet (just posted), so I only need to worry about the BB. \n\nGiven the BB folds very frequently (8/10 times in the sample), calling here to see a flop in position seems reasonable. If I hit a strong hand, I can extract value. If I miss, I can fold easily.\n\nHowever, I could also raise to try to take down the pot preflop. A min-raise to 16 would risk 16 to win 12. Given the BB folds 80% of the time, this could be profitable.\n\nLet me think about the best approach:\n- **Call**: Lower risk, see flop, play post-flop poker with position\n- **Raise**: Higher risk/reward, capitalize on BB's tightness\n\nGiven that T8o is not a strong raising hand, and I have position, I think calling is the better play. I want to keep the pot small with a marginal hand and use my position advantage post-flop. The BB's tightness means I might get a free card or face small bets I can call/fold to appropriately.",

My hand is extremely weak - I have nothing\n2. I'm in position which is good for bluffing, but...\n3. The board has a King which hits many calling ranges\n4. Both opponents checked, showing weakness but they could be trapping or have marginal hands\n5. With my healthy stack, I don't need to make desperate moves\n6. Checking is free and I can see a free card\n7. If I raise as a bluff, I risk chips with very little equity\n\n**Should I bluff?**\n- The board is somewhat coordinated with the Kh and potential straight draws\n- Both players showed weakness by checking\n- However, my hand has zero showdown value and limited potential\n- A bluff might work sometimes, but it's risky\n- With my stack size, I should be more selective\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a clear check situation. I have a very weak hand with no real potential, and there's no value in betting as a bluff here given the board texture and that I can see a free card. I should check and hope to improve on the turn, or fold if there's significant action.",

They have a King and now have trips or full house\n2. They had a flush draw that missed and are bluffing\n3. They had a straight that got counterfeited by the board pairing\n4. They have a weak hand and are trying to get me to fold\n\nGiven my hand is essentially trip Kings with a 10 kicker, I should consider:\n- If they have a King, their kicker could be better than mine\n\n\n- If they have a flush, I'm beaten\n- If they have a full house (Kx or 99), I'm beaten\n- If they're bluffing, I win\n\nI'll carefully weigh the pot odds and my potential hand strength against their possible holdings. The small river bet suggests they might be trying to extract value or block a potential flush. With my trip Kings and decent kicker, calling seems like a reasonable play.\n\nThe low pot-sized bet indicates they could be testing the waters with a marginal hand. I'll need to consider the potential range of hands they might be representing and whether my current holding can withstand a potential raise.\n\nGiven the paired board and my current trips, I suspect I'm likely ahead, but I'll stay cautious about potential full house combinations or a hidden King that could outkick my 10.",

This is a premium hand that I definitely want to play aggressively.\n\n**Position**: I'm UTG (Under the Gun), which is the worst position. However, with aces, position matters less because I want to build a pot with a strong hand.\n\n**Stack Size**: I have 231 chips (28.9 BB), which is a decent stack. Not too deep, not too short.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**:\n- **Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**: Has been folding a lot preflop but made a big raise to 60 and then 164 in hand #50. They showed down pocket tens, so they can make big raises with strong hands. They seem to be a tighter player who makes big moves with strong holdings.\n\n- **Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**: Has been folding a lot but made a raise to 20 in hand #48. They showed down A2, 22, and K5 suited in previous hands. They seem to be a bit looser and more passive.\n\n- **Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)**: Very tight player. Mostly folding preflop, occasionally calling (called 8 chips twice). They seem passive and only play when they have something decent.\n\n**Strategy**: With pocket aces from UTG, I want to:\n1. Build the pot since I have a huge equity advantage\n2. Protect against multiple callers who could crack my aces\n3. Extract value from strong hands\n\nGiven that I'm in early position, I should make a substantial raise. With blinds at 4/8, a standard raise would be 3-4x the big blind, but since I'm UTG with a premium hand, I should raise more to:\n- Thin the field\n- Build the pot\n- Get value from strong hands\n\nI have 231 chips, so I can afford a decent raise. A raise to about 24-32 chips (3-4x BB) would be standard, but given my position and the need to protect against multiple callers, I might want to go a bit larger.\n\nLet me raise to 32 chips (4x BB). This is a solid raise that:\n- Shows strength\n- Builds the pot\n- Should get folds from weak hands\n- Can get called by strong hands that I'll have dominated\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise amount shown is 16, which is 2x BB. But with pocket aces from UTG, I should raise larger. Let me go with 32 chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- I have Ad Ah (pocket aces) on the button\n- Flop: Jd 9d 6s (two diamonds, no straight draw yet)\n- Pot: 92 chips\n- I need to call 24 chips\n- Minimum raise to 48 chips\n- My stack: 199 chips (24.9 BB)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have an overpair (pocket aces) on a somewhat coordinated board with two diamonds\n- This is a strong hand but vulnerable to:\n  - Sets (JJ, 99, 66)\n  - Two pairs (J9, J6, 96)\n  - Flush draws\n  - Straight draws (QT, T8, 87)\n- However, I still have the best hand most of the time\n\n**Opponent Analysis (MiniMax-M2 in seat 4):**\nFrom the opponent history:\n- Very tight preflop player (folds most hands)\n- When they do play, they tend to be straightforward\n- On the flop, they've bet in several hands (hands 9, 31, 33, 40)\n- They seem to bet with made hands or strong draws\n- They folded on flop in hands 39, 44 when facing pressure\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- MiniMax-M2 called my 4x preflop raise (32 chips)\n- Now they're betting 24 into a 92 chip pot on the flop\n- This is a relatively small bet (about 26% pot)\n- They could have:\n  - A Jack (AJ, KJ, QJ, JT)\n  - A flush draw\n  - A straight draw\n  - A set (less likely but possible)\n  - Two pair\n  - Or they could be testing with air\n\n**My Decision:**\nWith pocket aces on this board, I should:\n1. **Raise for value** - I likely have the best hand\n2. **Protect against draws** - There are flush and straight draws possible\n3. **Get information** - A raise will tell me where I stand\n4. **Build the pot** - When I have the best hand, I want to win a big pot\n\nGiven the board texture and my strong hand, I should raise. The minimum raise is 48, but I should raise more to:\n- Charge draws properly\n- Get value from weaker hands\n- Protect my hand\n\nA good raise size would be around 3x their bet (72-80 chips total), or about 75% of the pot. Since the pot is 92 + 24 = 116, and I need to call 24, raising to about 80-90 total seems appropriate.\n\nLet me raise to 80 chips total (56 more than the call). This is a solid raise that charges draws and gets value from weaker hands.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 80,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have an overpair (pocket aces) on a coordinated board with possible flush and straight draws. Opponent is tight but betting small (26% pot). I need to raise for value, protect against draws, and get information.

No pair, no draw, nothing.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position, but doesn't help much with this hand.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is the only opponent left. Looking at their history:\n   - They fold a lot preflop (hands 45, 46, 48, 49, 51)\n   - They called in hand 50 but folded on the flop after seeing a bet\n   - In hand 52, they called 24 preflop, bet 24 on the flop, then folded\n   - They seem to play somewhat tight/passive\n\n4. **Action**: They checked to me on the flop. This is a strong indication they don't have a monster hand. With Ad Kc Qd on the board, if they had an Ace, King, or Queen, or a strong draw, they might have bet.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is 16 chips. If I bet, I could potentially win it.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 283 chips (35.4 BB), which is a healthy stack. I can afford to take some small risks, but I shouldn't be reckless.\n\nThis is a good spot for a continuation bet/bluff. The board is very scary (broadway cards), and my opponent checked, showing weakness. I can represent having an Ace, King, or Queen. \n\nGiven that my opponent has shown a tendency to fold to aggression (folded on flop in hand 50 after calling preflop, and folded in hand 52 after betting), a bet here seems profitable.\n\nMinimum raise to is 8 (which would be a bet of 8 into a pot of 16). That's a reasonable half-pot bet. I could also go a bit larger to 12-16.\n\nLet me make a standard continuation bet. I'll bet 12 chips (3/4 pot) which is a good size to put pressure and represents strength.",

The turn card (Jc) completes both potential straights and brings a 3rd club for a flush draw.\n\n**My hand:** I have absolutely nothing - just 7-high with no draw.\n\n**Opponent's likely range:**\nGiven they called preflop from SB and called my flop bet, they likely have:\n- Some piece of this board (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, or club draw)\n- Possibly a made straight with T-x\n- Two pair or a set\n- Strong draw (flush draw with a pair)\n\n**Decision analysis:**\n1. I have zero equity with 7-high\n2. The board is very scary with multiple draws completing\n3. Opponent called my flop bet, suggesting they have something\n4. They're now checking the turn - this could be:\n   - Weakness (missed draw)\n   - Trap with a monster (made straight, two pair)\n   - Pot control with top pair\n\n5. Pot is 40 chips, betting would commit more chips with no hand\n6. I have position and can see a free river card\n7. My opponent is short-stacked and could be trapping\n\n**Conclusion:** Checking is the clear best option. I have absolutely no hand, no draws, and no reason to bet. I should take the free river card and hope to improve, though even if I hit a 7 or 5 it likely won't be good on this board. Folding is not an option since checking is free. Raising would be pure bluffing with no equity, which is not advisable against a player who has shown strength by calling flop.\n\nThe best play is to check and see a free river.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation step by step:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- My cards: 7c 5s (7 of clubs, 5 of spades)\n- Board: Ad Kc Qd Jc 4s (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 4)\n- Position: BTN (button)\n- My stack: 271 chips (33.9 BB)\n- Pot: 52 chips\n- River bet: 12 chips to call\n- Minimum raise: 24 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nMy hand is 7-5 offsuit. The board shows A-K-Q-J-4. This is a very coordinated board with four cards to a straight (10 would make a straight). I have absolutely nothing - no pair, no straight draw, no flush draw. My best hand is Ace high.\n\n**Opponent Analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nLooking at the opponent's history:\n- They tend to fold a lot preflop\n- When they do play, they sometimes bet aggressively (like in hand 40 and 52)\n- In hand 52, they called 24 preflop, bet 24 on flop, then folded\n- They seem capable of bluffing but also folding to pressure\n\n**Current Hand Action:**\n- Preflop: They called SB (4 chips) and I checked BB\n- Flop: They checked, I bet 12, they called\n- Turn: They checked, I checked\n- River: They bet 12\n\nThe river bet is small (less than 1/4 pot). This could be:\n1. A value bet with a strong hand\n2. A blocking bet with a marginal hand\n3. A bluff\n\nGiven the board texture (very scary with 4 to a straight), and the fact that they called my flop bet, they could have:\n- A pair (maybe Ace-x, King-x, Queen-x)\n- Two pair\n- A straight (if they have T-9 or T-x)\n- A flush draw that missed (but there are only 2 clubs on board)\n- Complete air/bluff\n\n**My situation:**\n- I have absolutely nothing\n- The bet is small relative to pot (12 to win 52 = 23% pot odds)\n- I need to be good ~19% of the time to break even on a call\n- However, I have no showdown value\n\n**Decision:**\nI should fold. I have no hand, no draw, and while the bet is small, I'm not getting the right odds to call with just Ace-high. The opponent could easily have any pair or better. Even if they're bluffing sometimes, it's not worth risking chips with such a weak hand. I need to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nI cannot raise as a bluff because:\n1. I have no equity if called\n2. The opponent has shown they can call bets\n3. My stack is healthy and I don't need to take high-risk bluffs right now",

Fold - conservative, preserves stack\n2. Call - see flop with pocket pair, hoping to hit set\n3. Raise - take initiative, but out of position\n\nGiven I'm out of position with a small pocket pair, and I have a healthy stack, I think the best play is to either fold or call. Calling is reasonable given the pot odds and implied odds if I hit a set. However, playing out of position is difficult.\n\nLet me think about the raise sizing. If I raise to 24, I'm risking 24 to win 28, and I'll still be out of position. This seems like a high-risk play with a marginal hand.\n\nI think calling is the best option here. The pot odds are good (2.33:1), and if I hit a set on the flop, I can potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold to further aggression.",

Given the board texture and their aggression, they likely have:\n- A T (AT, KT, QT, JT, T9, T8)\n- An overpair (JJ+)\n- A strong draw (J9, 9J, two hearts)\n- Possibly 88 or 77 for a set\n\n**Decision:**\nI have a weak underpair on a very dangerous board. I should check and see what they do. If they bet, I'll likely need to fold unless it's a very small bet that gives me good odds. Checking is the standard play here with a marginal hand.\n\nI don't want to bet because:\n1. I'm likely behind to any pair\n2. Many turn cards are bad for me (any T, 8, 7, 9, J, 6, or heart)\n3. I have showdown value but not betting value\n4. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to possibly get to showdown cheaply\n\nLet me check.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I have pocket 5s (5d 5s) in BB\n- Flop: 8h 7s Tc\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- I need to call 24 chips\n- I have 255 chips left (31.9 BB)\n- Only opponent: MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4 with 96 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have a pocket pair of 5s\n- The flop is 8h 7s Tc - very coordinated board with straight draws\n- I have an underpair to the board (all three cards are higher than my 5s)\n- No flush draw, but there are straight possibilities (9-6, J-9)\n- I have a backdoor straight draw if I hit a 6\n\n**Opponent Analysis - MiniMax-M2:**\nFrom the search results, I can see MiniMax-M2's patterns:\n- Hand 44: Called preflop with 9d Kh, folded to flop bet on 4d 4s 9h board\n- Hand 46: Folded preflop\n- Hand 48: Folded to preflop raise\n- Hand 50: Called preflop with 4s Qs, then folded to a 3-bet\n- Hand 52: Called preflop raise with unknown hand, bet flop on Jd 9d 6s, then folded to raise\n- Hand 53: Called preflop from SB, called flop bet, then bet river and won\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 seems to call preflop with marginal hands, sometimes bets flops, but can fold to pressure. They have a relatively short stack (96 chips = 12 BB).\n\n**Current Action:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 raised to 16, I called 12\n- Flop: I checked, they bet 24 (a 1/3 pot bet)\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 64\n- To call: 24\n- Pot odds: 64:24 or ~2.67:1\n- I need ~27% equity to call\n\n**Equity Analysis:**\nWith pocket 5s on this board, I likely have:\n- Beating: Pure bluffs, lower pairs (but none lower than 5s exist)\n- Losing: Any pair 8+, any straight draw, any two pair+\n\nGiven the coordinated board (8-7-T), MiniMax-M2 could have:\n- Any pair (8s, 7s, Ts, Jx, 9x)\n- Straight draws (J9, 96, etc.)\n- Two pair+ hands\n- Pure bluffs\n\nMy equity is likely very low here. Even against a pure bluff with two overcards, I'm only ~50%. Against any pair or draw, I'm crushed.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (31.9 BB)\n- MiniMax-M2 is short (12 BB)\n- This is a tournament - preserving chips is important\n- Calling here would commit me further with a weak hand\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. I have an underpair on a coordinated board with multiple draws possible. The opponent bet into me, showing strength. Even if they're bluffing sometimes, I don't have enough equity to call, and I don't want to invest more chips with such a weak holding. \n\nFolding preserves my stack for better spots. If I call 24 here, the pot becomes 88, and I'll likely face more pressure on the turn with the same weak hand.\n\nThe only argument for continuing might be if MiniMax-M2 is extremely aggressive and bluffing often, but even then, I have very little to fight back with. My hand has almost no improvement potential (only 2 outs to a set, which is still vulnerable to straights).\n\nI should fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - best position\n- Cards: 7c Jd (offsuit, low-medium connectors)\n- Stack: 255 chips (31.9 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- To call: 8 chips\n- Min raise: 16 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - Recent history shows mostly folding preflop (hands 49, 52, 53, 54 all folded). In hand 50, they made a big raise to 60 then 164 (likely had premium hand). In hand 51, they called SB and checked down to fold on turn. Showdown history shows they play premium pairs (TT) and suited connectors (Ts6s).\n  \n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - Very tight player. Has folded preflop in hands 49, 50, 52, 53, 54. In hand 51, they checked down and made a river bet. Showdowns show they play Ax hands (A2o) and small pairs (22). Seems conservative.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- J7o is a marginal hand, especially offsuit\n- I'm on the button - best position\n- Both opponents appear tight based on recent history\n- The BB (DeepSeek) has been very tight, folding most hands\n- Pot odds: 8 to win 12 = 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed\n- J7o vs random hand has about ~45% equity\n- But against tight ranges, equity drops significantly\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Position: Excellent (on button)\n2. Hand strength: Weak (J7o)\n3. Opponents: Both appear tight\n4. Stack depth: Good (31.9 BB)\n5. Tournament: Need to accumulate chips but avoid marginal spots\n\n**Recommendation:**\nGiven the tight nature of both opponents and my position, I could consider a steal raise. However, J7o is very weak and if called, I'll be out of position postflop (though I'm on button, so I'd have position). \n\nActually, wait - I'm ON the button, so I have position on both players postflop. That's a huge advantage.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n- Both opponents fold a lot preflop\n- I'm on button\n\n\n- 8 chips is 2.5% of my stack\n- If I raise to 16 (2x BB), I'm risking 6.3% of my stack to win 1.5% of my stack\n\nI'll take a calculated risk and call. The minimal investment with position against tight opponents makes this a worthwhile speculative play. The pot odds are decent, and I'm getting a discount to see the flop. If I miss completely, I can easily fold. If I hit a strong draw or pair, I can leverage my position to potentially take down the pot.\n\nThe button position provides maximum flexibility. I'll see the flop cheaply and can make a move if the board texture favors my hand or allows a strategic bluff. This low-risk approach lets me gather information while maintaining my stack's integrity.",

J7 offsuit missed completely\n- Board shows K-T-3 rainbow. I have no pair, no draw, no backdoor flush draw\n- My hand has very little equity against any reasonable BB defending range\n\n**Opponent Analysis (DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nFrom the hand history:\n- Very tight player - folded preflop in 6 of last 10 hands\n- Only saw showdown once in hand 51 where they checked, called turn, then bet river\n- Generally passive, checking frequently\n\nGiven that this player is tight and checked the flop, they likely have:\n- A weak hand that missed the board\n- Some marginal showdown value\n- Or they could be trapping with a strong hand (less likely given their tight nature)\n\n**Position & Stack:**\n- I'm on the button with position advantage\n- Healthy stack of 30.9 BB\n- Pot is small (20 chips)\n\n**Decision:**\nWith absolutely no hand equity (J-high), I should not be betting here. The opponent is tight and has shown weakness by checking. I could consider a bluff, but:\n1. My hand has no backup equity if called\n2. The opponent might call with any pair or even A-high\n3. The pot is small, not worth risking chips\n4. Better to preserve my stack for better spots\n\nChecking behind is the clear best option here.

I need a Jack to make a pair (3 outs), or a 7 to make a pair (3 outs), but that's only 6 outs total, giving me about 12% equity.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the recall, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in most hands (hands 39-47, 49-50, 52-54)\n- Only raised once preflop (hand 48)\n- In hand 51, they checked flop, checked turn, called 20 on turn, then bet 20 on river\n\nThis suggests DeepSeek-V3.2 is a tight player who bets with strong hands. Their turn bet of 12 into a pot of 32 suggests strength.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 32\n- Bet: 12\n- Total pot if I call: 44\n- I need to call 12 to win 44\n- Pot odds: 12/44 = 27%\n- My equity is likely much lower than this (maybe 10-15% at best)\n\n\nI'll cut my losses and fold. The opponent's tight betting pattern and my weak hand make continuing too risky. The pot odds don't justify chasing such a slim chance of improving.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the hand:\n- I'm on the BTN with AcTs (ace-ten suited)\n- I have 239 chips (29.9 BB) - a bit below average\n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 20 chips\n- Opponent in Seat 2 (also named Kimi-K2) called 8 chips\n- Everyone else folded\n\nI need to check on the opponent in Seat 2. They just called from what appears to be MP (seat 2). Let me analyze their tendencies:\n\nFrom the recall data:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been very tight - lots of folds\n- When they do raise, they've raised to 24 (3x BB) and sometimes larger\n- In hand 50 they raised to 60 then 164 (big pot)\n- In hand 51 they called 4 then check-folded on turn\n- They just called 8 here, which is unusual - they usually fold or raise\n\nThis limp-call from a typically tight player suggests:\n1. They might have a medium strength hand\n2. They could be trying to trap with a monster\n3. They're getting more aggressive or changing strategy\n\nMy hand: AcTs is a good hand on the button. It's:\n- Playable from BTN vs one opponent\n- Has good equity against most ranges\n- Can hit strong top pair, straight draws, nut flush draw\n\nPosition: I'm on the BTN, which is excellent position. I have the advantage of acting last postflop.\n\nStack size: I have 29.9 BB, which is workable but not deep. I should avoid marginal all-in situations.\n\nDecision: I have the option to check (free flop) or raise. \n\nChecking: I get to see a free flop with a decent hand in position. This is low risk.\n\nRaising: I could raise to isolate, but the pot is already 20 and I'd need to raise to at least 16 more (total 24). This would be a 3x raise over the call.\n \nI'm sensing a shift in the opponent's behavior. Their recent limp-call breaks from their typical tight pattern. This could indicate a more nuanced strategy or a change in their playing style. I'll cautiously check to gather more information on the flop, keeping my options open while minimizing risk.",

This is a trash hand that should be folded in most situations.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Recent actions show they folded in hand 55, raised in 56, called in 57, then checked multiple times in hand 58. They seem somewhat passive/tricky. Showdowns show they had Ts6s (missed draw) and TT (set).\n- Seat 3 (BB): Very tight - folded preflop in hands 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58. Only played hand 51 (made a river bet) and hand 55 (checked then turn bet). Showdowns show they had A2 (ace high), 22 (set), and 5sKs (trips). They seem to only play strong hands.\n\nGiven:\n1. My hand is terrible (4s 9c offsuit)\n2. I'm on the button which is good position, but not enough to compensate for such a weak hand\n3. The BB player is very tight - if I call and they have a real hand, I'll be in trouble\n4. I have to call 8 chips to win 12 (1.5:1 pot odds) which is not enough for this hand\n5. I have a decent stack of 31.9 BB and should preserve it\n\nThis is an easy fold. The hand has no potential, I'm facing a tight opponent in the BB, and calling would just be throwing chips away.",

It's not connected, not suited, and both cards are low.\n\n2. **Position**: BB (big blind) - I'm out of position post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 in Seat 3 has raised to 48 (3x the BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They fold most of the time preflop (hands 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58)\n   - When they do raise preflop (hand 59), they bet aggressively on the flop\n   - They seem to be a relatively tight player who folds often\n   - Their stack is 169 chips (about 10.5 BB), so they're in a similar situation to me\n\n4. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is 72 chips\n   - I need to call 32 chips\n   - Pot odds: 72:32 or 2.25:1\n   - This means I need ~31% equity to call profitably\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: \n   - I have 239 chips (14.9 BB)\n   - This is a relatively short stack in tournament terms\n   - I should be selective with my hands and avoid marginal spots\n\n6. **Hand equity**: 3c 9d has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a wide range, this hand performs very poorly.\n\n7. **Tournament situation**: With 14.9 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. Calling here with a trash hand out of position would be a mistake.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, I'm out of position, and I should preserve my tournament stack for better opportunities. The 32 chips I'm risking might not seem like much, but it's over 13% of my stack on a hand that has very little chance of winning.\n\nEven though the opponent appears to be tight and might be stealing, 3-9 offsuit is just too weak to defend with, especially when I have to invest 32 chips (13.4% of my stack).",

Not a hand I want to play.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions post-flop (I'll be acting first).\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's actions:\n   - They raise to 32 (2x the BB) from Seat 4\n   - Recent history shows they fold a lot preflop (hands 55, 56, 57, 59, 61)\n   - When they do play, they show aggression (hand 54: raise pre, bet flop; hand 58: call pre, bet turn and river; hand 60: call pre, bet flop)\n   - Their raise here suggests real strength\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 231 chips (14.4 BB) - this is a short stack in tournament terms\n   - MiniMax-M2 has 68 chips (4.25 BB) - they are very short\n   - The BB (Seat 2) has 392 chips (24.5 BB)\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 24 chips to win 56 (current pot) = 56:24 or about 2.3:1. This is not great odds for a hand this weak.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 14.4 BB, I need to be selective. This is not a spot to invest chips with a weak hand out of position. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nThe raise from MiniMax-M2, given their tendency to fold often preflop, suggests they have a real hand here. My J4o is dominated by almost any reasonable raising hand.\n\nI should fold.",

Position: I'm on the Button which is great, but not enough to play this hand.\n3. Stack size: 14.4 BB is getting short but not desperate yet. I need to preserve my stack for better spots.\n4.

I don't need to check opponent history for this decision - it's a trivial fold with a trash hand when I still have a workable stack.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. With 14.4 BB, I am getting short. Could this be a spot to shove? No, that's not right. With 2-5 offsuit, even on the button, this is a fold. I need to preserve my chips for better hands or better spots. The only consideration might be if the blinds are extremely tight and I could steal, but with 14.4 BB and two players left to act, and with a hand this bad, it's still a fold.\n\nActually, wait. Let me think about tournament dynamics. At 14.4 BB, I'm not in desperate territory yet. I can wait for a better hand. Stealing with 2-5 offsuit is just burning chips. Even if both opponents fold 70% of the time, it's not profitable with this hand and these stack sizes.\n\nClear fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Situation:**\n- Position: UTG (worst position)\n- Cards: Qh Th (suited connectors, decent but not premium)\n- Stack: 231 chips (14.4 BB) - This is a short stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- To call: 16 chips (1 BB)\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): 384 chips - has been active, raised in hand 60, folded in 61 and 63\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): 241 chips - has been aggressive, raised in hand 61, folded in 62\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 108 chips - short stack, has been active, raised in hand 62\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: QTs suited is a decent hand but it's marginal from UTG position. From early position, you typically want to play much tighter.\n\n2. **Stack Size**: With only 14.4 BB, I'm in the danger zone. Tournament survival is a concern. I need to be selective about when to commit chips.\n\n3. **Position**: UTG is the worst position. I'll have to act first postflop, which is a huge disadvantage.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recent history:\n   - Seat 3 has been aggressive (raised in hand 61)\n   - Seat 4 has been active and raised in hand 62\n   - There's potential for someone to raise behind me\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a short stack, I should be looking for spots to either:\n   - Shove all-in with a strong hand\n   - Fold marginal hands to preserve chips\n   - Open raise to steal blinds\n\n6. **Pot odds**: 16 chips to win 24 (1.5:1) - not really relevant preflop from UTG\n\n**Decision**: This is a fold. QTs from UTG with a short stack is too risky. If I call 16 chips (1 BB), I'm committing ~7% of my stack with a marginal hand out of position. Someone could easily raise behind me, forcing me to fold anyway. I need to preserve my chips for better spots, preferably in later position or with stronger hands.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

My opponent is aggressive but checked, which could indicate weakness or a trap. With a short stack of 12.4 BB, I need to preserve chips. Checking allows me to see a free card with some showdown value while avoiding a potential check-raise from a strong hand or draw.\"\n}\n```",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the button (BTN) with 5h 6h\n- Stack: 199 chips (12.4 BB) - quite short\n- Board: 6c Qc 8c\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in SB (Seat 4) with 100 chips\n- On the flop, opponent checked\n\n**My hand:** I have bottom pair with 6h, plus a backdoor flush draw (hearts) and a gutshot straight draw (7 for a straight).\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at the opponent history for MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):\n- They seem to be an aggressive player who frequently bets and raises\n- They make continuation bets often (hands 54, 58, 60)\n- They've shown they can fold preflop (hands 55, 56, 57, 59, 61, 63)\n- They called preflop and then bet on flop in hand 60\n- They check-called in hand 53, then checked turn and bet river\n- They raised preflop in hands 54 and 62\n\nThe fact that they checked to me on this flop is interesting. This is a very coordinated board with three clubs. They might have:\n1. A weak hand that missed completely\n2. A strong hand like a made flush or top pair that wants to trap\n3. A draw that wants to see a free card\n\n**My situation:** I'm short-stacked with 12.4 BB. I need to accumulate chips or I'll be blinded out. I have bottom pair which might be good, but there are many scary cards that can come (any club, any Q, any 8, any 7, any overcard).\n\n**Pot odds:** The pot is 64 and I can check for free. If I bet, I need to consider what size.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I have a weak made hand (bottom pair)\n2. The board is very wet and dangerous\n3. My opponent is aggressive but checked\n4. I'm short-stacked and need to win pots\n5. I have some equity with my pair and backdoor draws\n\nGiven my short stack and the fact that I'm on the button with some showdown value, I think checking is the best play. Betting here would be a semi-bluff, but:\n- My opponent is aggressive and might check-raise\n- I don't have a strong draw (no flush draw, only gutshot)\n- My hand has some showdown value that I might realize for free\n- If I bet and get called, I'm in tough spot on turn\n\nI should check behind and see a free card, hoping to improve or get to showdown cheaply.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I'm very short-stacked (12.4 BB). The pot is already 64 chips, which is about 32% of my stack. If I bet around 32-40 chips (half pot), I could:\n1. Take down the pot right now\n2. Charge draws to continue\n3. Set up a turn shove\n\nBut if I get check-raised, I'd be in a tough spot. Given the coordinated board and that my opponent checked, they might be trapping with a strong hand.\n\nI think the safest and most correct play is to check. I have some showdown value, and I don't want to build a big pot with just bottom pair on a dangerous board.",

I have a decent draw with some showdown value. The opponent's bet of 80 into 144 is a relatively strong bet (55% of pot). Given the opponent's history of making smaller bets and folding to pressure, this larger bet suggests strength.\n\nHowever, I have:\n1. A made hand (pair of 6s)\n2. An open-ended straight draw (8 outs)\n3. The pot is already large relative to my stack\n\nLet me calculate my equity roughly:\n- 8 outs for the straight (4s and 9s) = ~16% chance on river\n- 2 outs for trips (6s) = ~4% chance\n- 3 outs for two pair (5s) = ~6% chance\n- Total outs: ~13 = ~26% chance\n\nBut wait, some of these outs might be tainted by the flush draw. The 4c and 9c would complete the flush which my opponent might have.\n\nActually, the board has 6c Qc 8c. If I hit a 4c or 9c, that would make 4 clubs on board. I only have 5h 6h, so I don't have a club. Hitting a club could be dangerous.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n- Clean outs: 4d, 4s, 4h, 9d, 9s, 9h = 6 outs for straight\n- 6 outs = ~12% chance\n- Plus 2 outs for trips (6d, 6s) = 4%\n- Plus 3 outs for two pair (5d, 5s, 5c) = 6%\n- Total: ~22% equity\n\nPot odds require 35.7% equity. This is not a profitable call based on pure pot odds.\n\nHowever, there are implied odds considerations. If I hit my straight, I might win my opponent's remaining stack (20 chips). But that's only 20 more chips.\n\nWait, the opponent only has 20 chips left! They bet 80, but they only have 20 chips remaining. If I call 80, the opponent cannot bet on the river - they will be all-in or have very little left.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- Opponent stack: 20 chips\n- If I call 80, pot will be 224 on river\n- Opponent will have 20 left, which is less than 10% of pot\n- They would likely be committed\n\nGiven the opponent's tiny remaining stack and my decent draw with some showdown value, I think this is actually a call.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - great position\n- Cards: Qc 4h - offsuit, low kicker, not a strong hand\n- Stack: 191 chips (11.9 BB) - getting short\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 8 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at Kimi-K2's recent actions:\n- Hand 60: Raised preflop to 24, then called 40 on flop, bet 120 on turn (aggressive)\n- Hands 61-65: Folded 4 times in a row preflop (tight)\n- Hand 59: Called preflop, then folded on flop\n- Hand 58: Checked through, called turn, folded river\n\nKimi-K2 seems to be playing somewhat tight recently, folding a lot preflop. They were aggressive in hand 60 but have been folding since.\n\n**My Recent Play:**\nLooking at my last 10 hands:\n- I've been folding a LOT (8 out of 10 hands)\n- When I did play: Won hand 57 with AT from BB, lost hand 65 when I raised with 56s and folded on turn\n- Generally playing tight, which is appropriate given my short stack\n\n**Decision Making:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Q4o is a weak hand. Q-high with a 4 kicker is not playable in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is the best position, but that doesn't make up for the poor hand quality.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: At 11.9 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate yet. I should be selective and look for spots to shove or steal, but Q4o is too weak even for a steal attempt.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot preflop lately (4 folds in a row), so they might be tight. However, they could also be due to defend. Even if they're tight, Q4o is just too weak to play.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, getting 3:1 odds. This might seem tempting, but with Q4o I'm rarely going to hit a strong enough hand to continue postflop, and I'll be out of position after the flop (since I'm SB/BB relative to the opponent).\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 11.9 BB, I should preserve my stack for better spots. Q4o is not a hand I want to invest chips in.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold. This is an easy fold despite the good position and decent pot odds. The hand is simply too weak to play, especially with a short stack where I need to be selective.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the hand:\n\n**My hand**: K\u26609\u2665 - This is a marginal hand. King-high but with a weak kicker (9). Not suited, not connected.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is excellent position, the best at the table.\n\n**Stack**: 191 chips = 11.9 BB - This is a short stack. In tournament poker, this is in the \"push/fold\" territory, though I have enough chips for one more orbit.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 384 chips - relatively active, has shown aggression with raises and calls\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 225 chips - seems tight, folding a lot preflop\n\n**Pot odds**: Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1), which is 40% equity needed.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: K9o is marginal. It plays poorly against tight ranges and is easily dominated by KQ, KJ, KT, AK, etc.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is great, but with a short stack and a marginal hand, position advantage is limited.\n3. **Stack size**: At 11.9 BB, I should be thinking about push/fold. A standard raise would commit too much of my stack.\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 2 (SB): Has been active, calling and raising. Showed down TT (pocket tens) and Ts6s previously.\n   - Seat 3 (BB): Very tight, folding most preflop hands. Only active when raising (48 chip raise in hand 61).\n5. **Tournament situation**: With a short stack, I need to preserve chips for better spots or look for spots to steal blinds.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. K9o is too weak to risk 16 chips (8% of my stack) against potentially strong ranges. The SB has shown aggression and could easily have me dominated. The BB is tight but could wake up with a strong hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot, preferably in late position with a stronger hand or when I can go all-in as a steal.\n\nHowever, given my short stack and button position, I could also consider an all-in steal. Let me reconsider:\n\n- If I go all-in for 191, I'm risking 191 to win 24 (immediate pot) + potentially both blinds (8+16 = 24) = 48 total.\n- This is about 4:1 pot odds for the opponents, making it unattractive for them to call without strong hands.\n- Given the BB is very tight, they might fold often.\n- The SB has been more active but might still fold to an all-in.\n\nBut K9o is really marginal for an all-in. I should save my tournament life for better spots. Folding is the disciplined play.",

I have to act first postflop.\n\n**Stack**: 191 chips (11.9 BB) - This is a short stack, but not desperate yet.\n\n**Pot**: 24 chips (1.5 BB)\n\n**Situation**: I need to call 16 chips (1 BB) to see the flop.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Q2 offsuit is trash. It's not suited, has no connectivity, and the 2 is worthless. Even if I hit a Q, I'm often dominated by better kickers.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is terrible.

I shouldn't be calling and playing postflop with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, I can see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 is somewhat active (called in hand 65, made a big bet of 80 on turn)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 is very short (8 chips) and seems aggressive (made a big raise of 225 in hand 67)\n   - Kimi-K2 is the big stack and seems capable of making big calls\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a short stack, I need to preserve my chips for better spots. Q2 offsuit from UTG is definitely not a spot to invest chips.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I'm getting 24:16 or 1.5:1 pot odds, which is not enough to justify calling with this garbage hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold.

Opponent in seat 3 appears tight based on history (folds most hands, raises with strong holdings like JJ). At 10.9 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots where I can be the aggressor rather than calling raises out of position with weak kickers.\"\n}\n```",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current hand:**\n- My position: BB (Seat 1)\n- My cards: 3h As (Ace-Three offsuit)\n- My stack: 175 chips (10.9 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 56 chips\n- Amount to call: 16\n- Minimum raise to: 48\n\n**Action so far:**\n- SB posted 8\n- BB posted 16 (me)\n- Seat 2 folded\n- Seat 3 raised to 32\n- Seat 4 folded\n\n**Opponent analysis (Seat 3 - DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nLooking at their preflop actions from the recall:\n- They fold a lot (hands 56, 57, 58, 62, 64, 65, 66)\n- When they raise: hand 59 (24), hand 61 (48), hand 67 (225 - all-in)\n- When they call: hand 60 (20), hand 68 (8)\n- Showdowns: JJ, 99-TT, 22, 5s-Ks, As-2s\n\nThis suggests they play fairly tight and their raises typically represent strong hands. The raise to 32 (2x BB) is relatively small.\n\n**My situation:**\n- I have As-3h - a decent but not great hand\n- I'm getting 3.5:1 pot odds (56:16)\n- I have 10.9 BB left, which is getting short\n- The opponent appears to be tight-aggressive when they do enter pots\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: As-3h is marginal. The ace is good but the kicker is weak.\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB, so I'll act first postflop - disadvantageous\n3. **Stack size**: At 10.9 BB, I'm in the danger zone. I need to be careful about committing chips.\n4. **Opponent tendency**: Opponent appears tight, so their raise likely means strength\n5. **Pot odds**: 3.5:1 is decent but not great given my hand strength and position\n\nGiven that I'm out of position with a marginal hand against a tight opponent who has shown strength, and I'm short-stacked, I should fold here. The risk of losing more chips postflop when I'm out of position isn't worth it. I should preserve my stack for better spots, especially when I can be the aggressor.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The pot is 56 and I need to call 16. That's 3.5:1 pot odds. With an Ace, I might be ahead sometimes. But I'm out of position and short-stacked. \n\nActually, looking at my stack more carefully: 175 chips at 8/16 blinds means I have 10.9 BB. This is a critical stack size where I need to be very selective. \n\nThe opponent raised to 32, which is 2x BB. This could be a steal attempt. However, given their tight history, it's more likely a value raise.\n\nI think folding is the best option. I don't want to risk my tournament life on A3o out of position against a tight opponent's raise.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - great position\n- Cards: T\u2665 6\u2665 (Ten of Hearts, Six of Hearts) - suited connectors\n- Stack: 167 chips (10.4 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - 577 chips, seems to be a solid player with some strong hands shown (AA, 66)\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - 64 chips (4 BB), very short stack, seems aggressive preflop\n\n**Opponent Tendencies from Memory:**\nKimi-K2 (Seat 2):\n- Has been folding a lot preflop (hands 64, 65, 69, 70)\n- Made raises in hands 67 and 68 (showed AA in hand 68)\n- When they raised, they showed strong hands\n- Generally seems tight-aggressive\n\nDeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3):\n- Also folds a lot (hands 64, 65, 66)\n- Made big raises in hands 67 (225), 69 (32), 70 (56)\n- Hand 67 showed JJ, so they can make big raises with strong pairs\n- In hand 68 they just called with T9\n- Seems to be getting more aggressive recently\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: T6 suited is a marginal hand. It's suited and connected, which gives some potential, but it's not a strong starting hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position. This means I'll act last postflop.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes**: \n   - I'm short-stacked at 10.4 BB\n   - BB is very short at 4 BB (64 chips)\n   - SB is deep at 36 BB\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: With 10.4 BB, I'm in the danger zone. I need to be selective about when I commit chips. However, I'm getting good odds to call (16 to win 24, or 1.5:1).\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1). Against random hands, T6s has about 35-40% equity, so the pot odds aren't quite good enough for a pure call based on equity alone.\n\n6. **Implied Odds**: If I hit a strong hand (flush or straight), I could win a big pot, especially against the deep-stacked SB.\n\n**Decision**: \nGiven that I'm on the button with a suited connector, getting decent pot odds, and the BB is very short and might shove, I think calling is reasonable. However, T6s is quite weak. \n\nThe BB has been aggressive and might defend their blind. If they shove (which they could with 64 chips), I'd have to call 48 more chips into a pot of 88, getting less than 2:1 odds.\n\nWith a short stack of 10.4 BB, I should be more selective. T6s is not strong enough to call here, especially when the BB is aggressive and short. Folding is the best option to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. On the button with a suited hand, getting 1.5:1 odds, and position... it's borderline. But given my short stack and the fact that the BB is aggressive and might shove, I think folding is safer. I need to preserve my chips for better hands.\n\nWait, let me think again. With 10.4 BB, I'm in push/fold territory for many hands. T6s is not strong enough to shove, and calling risks getting into a difficult postflop spot. The BB is very short and aggressive, which increases the risk of them shoving.\n\nI think the best play is to **fold**. Preserve my stack for a better spot, preferably with a stronger hand or against weaker opponents.",

          "content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 4c 7d (bottom pair with 4)\n- Board: Kc 4s Ks (two Kings, one 4)\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- To call: 48 chips\n- My stack: 151 chips (9.4 BB)\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in SB position, bet 48 on the flop\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have a pair of 4s on a K-K-4 board. This means I have trips (three of a kind) with 4s. This is actually a very strong hand! The board is K-K-4, so I have 4-4-4-K-K (full house, 4s full of Kings).\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall data on MiniMax-M2:\n- They fold preflop frequently (hands 59, 61, 63, 66-71)\n- When they do play, they bet aggressively on flops (hand 60: bet 40, hand 65: bet 80 on turn)\n- In hand 60, they bet 40 on flop, then checked turn and folded\n- They seem to be a relatively tight-aggressive player who folds a lot preflop but bets when they have something\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 80\n- To call: 48\n- Pot odds: 80:48 or ~1.67:1\n- This is about 37.5% equity needed to call\n\n**My Situation:**\n- I have a full house (4s full of Kings)\n- This is an extremely strong hand, likely the best hand\n- The only hands beating me would be K-x (trip Kings) or pocket Ks/KK (four of a kind)\n- Given opponent's betting pattern, they could have:\n  - A King (top pair)\n  - A pocket pair\n  - Some draw\n  - Complete bluff\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\n- I have 151 chips, which is short at 9.4 BB\n- I need to accumulate chips or I'll be blinded out\n- This is a strong hand to get my money in with\n\n**Decision:**\nI should raise here. I have a full house and need to build the pot and protect against any potential draws (though there aren't many dangerous draws on this board). A King would be the main concern, but even then I have trips and am likely ahead.\n\nMinimum raise is to 96, but I could also go all-in for 151. Given my short stack and the strength of my hand, going all-in makes sense to maximize pressure and potentially get called by worse hands.\n\nLet me think about the sizing:\n- If I raise to 96, that leaves me with 55 chips\n- If I just go all-in for 151, I put maximum pressure\n\nWith a full house on this board, I want to get value. Going all-in might fold out some hands, but given my short stack and the pot size, it's a reasonable play. However, a smaller raise might keep in more hands.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the board: Kc 4s Ks\nI have 4c 7d, so I have trip 4s, not a full house. The board is K-K-4, so if I have a 4, I have three 4s. That's trip 4s, which loses to any K-x hand (trip Kings).\n\nSo I have trip 4s, and the opponent could easily have a King. If they have any King, they have trip Kings which beats my trip 4s.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- Board: K-K-4\n- My hand: 4-7\n- My hand: 4-4-4-K-K (trip 4s with K-K kickers)\n- If opponent has K-x: K-K-K-4-x (trip Kings with 4 kicker) - they win\n\nSo I'm losing to any King. What are the chances they have a King?\n- They called preflop from SB after I checked as BB\n- They could have a wide range: any pocket pair, any two broadway, any suited connectors, any King\n- The flop bet of 48 into a pot of 32 (after preflop action) is a 1.5x pot bet, which is strong\n\nGiven this, I might be behind. Let me think about the opponent's pattern:\n- They bet 40 on flop in hand 60, then checked turn and folded - suggests they bet for value/protection but gave up\n- They bet 80 on turn in hand 65 - strong bet\n\nThe bet of 48 here is quite large relative to the pot. This suggests strength.\n\n**Revised Decision:**\nI have trip 4s but any King beats me."

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - great position\n- Cards: Qh 7c (offsuit, not connected, mediocre hand)\n- Stack: 143 chips (8.9 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 8 chips (half of current bet)\n- Min raise: 32 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent actions from seat 2 (Kimi-K2 in BB):\n- Has been active, making raises (48 chips) and calls\n- Has shown down some strong hands: AA, TT, 66 (set), QcAd\n- Seems to defend BB with decent hands\n- In hand 67, called 177 preflop (big call) with 66 and won with a set\n- In hand 71, raised to 48, then called 32 more (so someone 3-bet)\n\n**My Situation:**\n- 8.9 BB is a short stack in tournament poker\n- Q7o is a very weak hand, even on the button\n- I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (call 8 to win 24)\n- However, with a short stack, I need to be selective\n- If I call, I'll have 135 chips left (8.4 BB)\n- If I raise to 32, I'd have 111 left (6.9 BB)\n- If I raise and get called/raised, I'm likely dominated\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- With <10 BB, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold\n- Q7o is not a shoving hand, even on the button\n- The opponent in BB seems competent and defends with real hands\n- I should preserve my stack for better spots\n\n**Decision:**\nFold. Q7o is too weak to play even with good position when I'm this short stacked. I need to wait for a better hand or situation. The opponent has shown they defend their BB with legitimate hands, so I can't steal profitably here. Preserve the 8.9 BB for a better spot.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I'm on the BUTTON with 8.9 BB. Maybe I should raise to steal? Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nActually, with Q7o and a short stack, even on the button, this is a fold. The hand has poor equity against typical BB defend ranges. If I raise to 32 (min raise), I'm committing ~22% of my stack with a weak hand. If I get called, I'm out of position postflop (actually I'd be in position, but with a weak hand and shallow stacks). \n\nBetter to fold and wait for a hand I can shove with or a better stealing hand. Q7o is just too weak.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: K4o (King of diamonds, 4 of spades) - This is a weak hand, offsuit with a weak kicker\n2. **My position**: Button (BTN) - good position\n3. **My stack**: 127 chips (7.9 BB) - very short stacked\n4. **Blinds**: 8/16\n5. **Current situation**: \n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB) posted 8\n   - I posted BB 16\n   - MiniMax-M2 called 8 more (since they posted 8 and need to call 8 more to match my BB)\n   - It's now my action with 0 to call (I can check or raise)\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n   - Very frequent folder preflop (folded in hands 61, 63, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73, 74)\n   - When they do play, they can be aggressive (bet 40 on flop in hand 60, bet 80 on turn in hand 65, bet 48 on flop in hand 72)\n   - They've called preflop a few times (hands 65, 72)\n   - They raised preflop once (hand 62, raised to 32)\n\nGiven that I'm extremely short-stacked (7.9 BB), I need to be looking for spots to get my chips in. I have position and a decent hand (K4o is not great but has some value). \n\nThe pot is currently 32 chips (my BB 16 + their SB 8 + their call 8). If I check, we'll see a flop and I'll still have 127 chips left.\n\nHowever, with a short stack like this, I should consider raising to try to take the pot down now or set up a favorable situation. A standard raise would be to 32 (minimum) or perhaps 48.\n\nBut wait - let me reconsider. K4o is a very weak hand. Even though I'm short-stacked, I should be selective. The fact that MiniMax-M2 called rather than folded suggests they might have something. They've been folding most hands but when they do play, they can be aggressive.\n\nWith 7.9 BB, I could:\n1. Check and see a flop (preserve chips)\n2. Raise to try to take it down now (risky with weak hand)\n3. Fold (but I have 0 to call, so folding is free but gives up any chance)\n\nGiven my extreme short stack, I should actually be more aggressive preflop with any decent hand. K4o is marginal but on the button with a short stack, I could consider a raise. However, I need to be careful - if I raise and get called, I'm committed.\n\nActually, let me reconsider more carefully. With 7.9 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. The standard play would be to either go all-in or fold. But since I have the option to check for free, I should take it with this weak hand. K4o is not strong enough to commit my stack with.\n\nThe pot is 32 and I have 127. If I check, I'm getting a free look at the flop. If I hit a King, I might have the best hand. If I don't, I can fold easily.\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 has been folding most hands preflop but called this one, they might have some marginal hand. But I don't have enough information to risk my tournament life with K4o.\n\nI think the best play is to check and see the flop. It's free and gives me a chance to hit something.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN (Button) with 9c 5d\n- Stack: 151 chips (9.4 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Amount to call: 8 (completing my small blind)\n- Minimum raise: 32\n- Only opponent: Kimi-K2 in BB with 673 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n9c 5d is a very weak hand, not connected, not suited, low cards. This is a fold in almost all situations.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at Kimi-K2's recent actions:\n- Very tight preflop: folded 8 out of 11 recent preflop opportunities (hands 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 69, 70, 72, 75)\n- When they do raise preflop, they show up with strong hands: AA (hand 68), 66 (hand 67), QQ (hand 71)\n- They 3-bet with strong hands and call raises with medium pairs\n- Showdowns reveal they play premium hands: AA, TT, 66\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 9.4 BB, which is a short stack\n- I'm on the button, which is good position\n- I need to be selective with hands when short-stacked\n- 9c 5d is not a good hand to risk chips with, even from button\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- I need to call 8 to win 24 (3:1 pot odds)\n- But with such a weak hand, even good pot odds don't justify calling\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 9c 5d is trash, especially for a short stack. Even though I'm getting decent pot odds and have position, this hand has very little equity against any reasonable BB defending range. I should preserve my chips for a better spot.\n\nThe opponent is tight and will likely defend their BB with decent hands. Even if I hit a 9 or 5, I'll often be dominated. The only way I'd consider playing this is if the opponent was extremely tight and I could steal, but calling 8 chips with this hand is just throwing chips away.",

The hand is too weak, and even though I'm in position, I don't want to invest 10.6% of my stack on such a weak holding.

It's not a strong starting hand, especially from the BB.\n\n2. **My position**: BB (out of position for the rest of the hand)\n\n3. **My stack**: 135 chips (8.4 BB) - I'm short-stacked but not desperate yet.\n\n4. **The action**:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB) posted 8\n   - I posted BB 16\n   - Kimi-K2 raised to 48\n   - MiniMax-M2 then re-raised to 100\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 84 to win 164 (already in pot), so about 2:1 pot odds.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Kimi-K2: Shows a pattern of raising to 48 in many hands (68, 71, 74, 77, and this hand). This seems like a standard raise size for them. They fold sometimes too.\n   - MiniMax-M2: Usually folds preflop (hands 71, 73, 74, 76, 77), but has called twice (hands 72, 75). The call in hand 72 was followed by a 48-chip bet on the flop.\n\n7. **Current situation**: MiniMax-M2 is making a big re-raise from the SB to 100. They only have 8 chips total, so this is effectively an all-in. This suggests they have a strong hand.\n\n8. **Hand strength**: K3o is a very weak hand. Even with the pot odds, I'm likely dominated by any King they have (better kicker) or any pair.\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: With 8.4 BB, I need to be selective. Calling 84 chips would leave me with only 51 chips if I lose. That's a huge chunk of my stack for a very marginal hand.\n\n10. **Decision**: This is a clear fold. K3o is too weak to call against a re-raise from a player who usually folds preflop. The re-raise to 100 from MiniMax-M2 (who only has 8 chips total) suggests they have a very strong hand. Even though I'm getting 2:1 pot odds, my hand equity is likely much worse than that against their range.\n\nI should fold and preserve my 8.4 BB stack for a better spot.",

Let me check the current situation:\n\n- I'm in SB with 7c 5s\n- My stack is 127 chips (7.9 BB) - very short\n- Blinds are 8/16\n- Pot is 32 chips\n- I need to call 8 to see the flop (already posted 8 as SB)\n- Only 2 players left: me and the BB (Kimi-K2)\n- Seat 4 is listed as calling 8, but they have 0 chips and are out - this seems like an error in the hand state\n\nWait, let me re-read the players:\n- Seat 1: Me - 127 chips\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 813 chips (BB)\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 0 chips (folded)\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (out)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (folded)\n\nThe action says \"Seat 4 call 8\" but Seat 4 has 0 chips and is out. This is confusing. Let me assume it's just me vs the BB.\n\nWith 7c 5s in SB:\n- This is a terrible hand, unsuited and disconnected\n- I'm very short stacked at 7.9 BB\n- I should be looking for spots to shove or fold\n- From SB, I've already invested 8 chips\n- I need to call 8 more to see flop (pot odds: 32:8 or 4:1)\n- The BB has a huge stack (813 chips) and can easily call any raise I make\n\nGiven my extreme short stack and terrible hand, I should fold. I need to preserve my chips for a better spot. With 7.9 BB, I should be looking for hands like any pocket pair, any Ace, any two Broadway cards, or suited connectors to shove with.\n\n7c 5s is not worth investing even 8 more chips.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 2s Td - This is a very weak hand (T2 offsuit). This is a fold in almost all situations.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - This is good position, but my hand is too weak to play.\n\n3. **My stack**: 127 chips (7.9 BB) - I'm in a critical situation with less than 8 big blinds. This is short-stack territory where I need to be selective about which hands I play.\n\n4. **Opponent action**: Seat 2 raised to 48 (3x the BB). Looking at the opponent history:\n   - They seem to raise frequently from SB position\n   - Recent raises: 48 in hands 74, 77, 78 (all preflop)\n   - They showed down some decent hands: TT, 66, AA, AQ, Q6\n   - They seem to be playing fairly aggressively\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 48 to win 64 (pot) + 48 (my call) = 112 chips. So 48/112 = ~43% equity needed. With T2 offsuit, I definitely don't have this equity against a raising range.\n\n6. **Tournament situation**: With only 7.9 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. T2 offsuit is not a hand I want to risk 38% of my stack on (48/127 = 38%).\n\n7. **Position advantage**: Even though I'm on the button, this hand is just too weak. I should wait for a better spot or at least a hand with some showdown value.\n\nThe only consideration is that with less than 10 BB, I could consider shoving as a steal if the opponent folds frequently. However, looking at their history, they raise quite often and have shown down decent hands. They don't seem to be folding much preflop.\n\nGiven:\n- Very weak hand (T2 offsuit)\n- Facing a raise (not just stealing blinds)\n- Short stack that needs preservation\n- Opponent shows aggression and doesn't fold often\n\nThis is a clear fold. I need to wait for a better hand or situation.",

This raise to 96 is much larger than their typical raises (double the usual size), which suggests significant strength.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is currently 144 chips\n   - I need to call 64 chips\n   - Pot odds: 144:64 or about 2.25:1\n   - This means I need ~31% equity to call\n\n7. **Hand equity**: With Q9o against a typical raising range, I likely have much less than 31% equity. Against a strong range (AA-22, AK-AT, KQ, etc.), Q9o has around 25-30% equity at best.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: With only 3 BB left, I need to be very selective. While I'm getting decent pot odds, Q9o is just too weak to risk my tournament life on, especially against what appears to be a very strong raise from Kimi-K2.\n\nThe decision should be to fold. I don't have a strong enough hand to justify calling off 2/3 of my remaining stack, and the opponent's unusually large raise suggests they have a premium hand.",

I'm in a critical tournament situation where I need to preserve my chips for better opportunities or go all-in with a decent hand.\n\n4. **Pot**: 48 chips\n   - SB: 16 (me)\n   - BB: 32 (Kimi-K2)\n   - Folded: MiniMax-M2\n\n5. **Action**: I need to call 16 more chips (I'm in for 16 already as SB).\n\n6. **Pot odds**: If I call 16, the pot will be 64 chips.

But with 7-2 offsuit, even these odds aren't good enough.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With only 2.5 BB left, I need to be extremely selective. 7-2 offsuit is definitely not a hand to risk my tournament life on. I should fold and wait for a better spot, even though I'll be down to 63 chips (less than 2 BB).\n\n8. **Opponent**: The BB is Kimi-K2 with a big stack (821 chips). They could call any raise I make easily.\n\n9. **Legal actions**: fold, call, raise (minimum raise to 64)\n\nThe correct play here is to fold. 7-2 offsuit is a trash hand, and with my short stack, I need to preserve chips for better opportunities. Even though I'll be left with less than 2 BB, it's better to wait for a hand with some equity rather than gamble with 7-2.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold situation based on hand strength and stack size.",

The blinds are listed as 16/32, but the actions show:\n- Seat 2 post_sb 16\n- Seat 4 post_bb 16\n- Seat 2 check\n\nThis is confusing. If blinds are 16/32, the big blind should be 32. But it shows Seat 4 posting BB of 16. Let me think about this...\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes and the context, it seems like the blinds might be 8/16, not 16/32. The \"16/32\" at the top might be a mistake or referring to something else. \n\nGiven:\n- My stack: 79 chips\n- If blinds are 8/16, then 79 chips is about 5 BB (79/16 = 4.94)\n- If blinds are 16/32, then 79 chips is about 2.5 BB (79/32 = 2.47)\n\nThe description says \"2.5 BB\" which suggests blinds are indeed 16/32. But then why is the BB only 16?\n\nLet me re-read the actions:\n- preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 16\n- preflop: Seat 4 post_bb 16\n- preflop: Seat 2 check\n\nSeat 2 is the SB and posted 16. Then Seat 4 (BB) posted 16. Then Seat 2 checked. This suggests Seat 2 is also the button? No, I'm Seat 1 on the BTN.\n \nI'm puzzled by the unusual blind structure. The pot size and posted blinds don't align with the stated 16/32 blinds. Something doesn't add up mathematically. The inconsistencies between the blind amounts, pot size, and stack calculations suggest there might be a misunderstanding about the actual game parameters.\n\nBreaking down the chip dynamics reveals a critical situation. With 79 chips and blinds at 16/32, I'm critically short-stacked at just 2.5 big blinds. This puts me in a desperate position where aggressive play becomes necessary. The pocket 4s offer potential, but with such a short stack, my options are severely limited. I'll need to make a strategic decision quickly, considering the 32-chip pot and my precarious chip count.\n\nThe all-in scenario looks mathematically sound. By going all-in for 79 chips, I'm creating a compelling pot odds situation.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 4s 4h (pocket 4s) - a small pocket pair\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - good position\n3. **My stack**: 79 chips (2.5 BB) - This is extremely short stacked, I'm in desperation mode\n4. **Blinds**: 16/32 (but pot shows 32, so it seems like blinds are actually 16/16 or something's off)\n5. **Pot**: 32 chips\n6. **Amount to call**: 16 chips\n7. **Minimum raise**: 48 chips\n\nWait, let me re-read this. The blinds are listed as 16/32, but the actions show:\n- Seat 2 post_sb 16\n- Seat 4 post_bb 16\n- Seat 2 check\n\nThis is confusing. If blinds are 16/32, the big blind should be 32. But it shows Seat 4 posting BB of 16. Let me think about this...\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes and the context, it seems like the blinds might be 8/16, not 16/32. The \"16/32\" at the top might be a mistake or referring to something else. \n\nGiven:\n- My stack: 79 chips\n- If blinds are 8/16, then 79 chips is about 5 BB (79/16 = 4.94)\n- If blinds are 16/32, then 79 chips is about 2.5 BB (79/32 = 2.47)\n\nThe description says \"2.5 BB\" which suggests blinds are indeed 16/32. But then why is the BB only 16?\n\nLet me re-read the actions:\n- preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 16\n- preflop: Seat 4 post_bb 16\n- preflop: Seat 2 check\n\nSeat 2 is the SB and posted 16. Then Seat 4 (BB) posted 16. Then Seat 2 checked. This suggests Seat 2 is also the button? No, I'm Seat 1 on the BTN.\n \nI'm puzzled by the unusual blind structure. The pot size and posted blinds don't align with the stated 16/32 blinds. Something doesn't add up mathematically. The inconsistencies between the blind amounts, pot size, and stack calculations suggest there might be a misunderstanding about the actual game parameters.\n\nBreaking down the chip dynamics reveals a critical situation. With 79 chips and blinds at 16/32, I'm critically short-stacked at just 2.5 big blinds. This puts me in a desperate position where aggressive play becomes necessary. The pocket 4s offer potential, but with such a short stack, my options are severely limited. I'll need to make a strategic decision quickly, considering the 32-chip pot and my precarious chip count.\n\nThe all-in scenario looks mathematically sound. By going all-in for 79 chips, I'm creating a compelling pot odds situation. The potential 111-chip total pot against the 16-chip call provides attractive 6.9-to-1 odds, making a call mathematically challenging for opponents with marginal hands. This move capitalizes on fold equity and the potential to double my critically low chip stack.\n\nMy position on the button further enhances this aggressive strategy, offering maximum information and positional advantage.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation again:\n\n- I have 4s 4h (pocket 4s)\n- I'm on the button (BTN)\n- My stack is 79 chips (listed as 2.5 BB)\n- Blinds are 16/32\n- Pot is 32 chips\n- Amount to call is 16\n- Minimum raise to 48\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nWait, the amount to call is 16, not 32. This means the action is:\n- SB posted 16\n- BB posted 16 (but should be 32 if blinds are 16/32?)\n- SB checked\n\nIf the BB is 16, then my stack is 79/16 = 4.9 BB, not 2.5 BB. But the description says \"2.5 BB\".\n\nLet me think about the actual situation. If blinds are 16/32:\n- SB should be 16\n- BB should be 32\n- But it says BB posted 16\n\nThis is confusing. Let me work with what's given:\n- I need to call 16 to see the flop\n- I have 79 chips total\n- This is about 5x the amount to call\n\nWith pocket 4s on the button, facing just a check from SB (no raise), I should definitely see the flop here. The call is only 16 chips from my 79 chip stack, giving me a chance to hit a set.\n\nPot odds: 32 in pot, 16 to call = 2:1 pot odds. But with a pocket pair, I'm looking to hit a set (about 7.5:1 against). However, with such a short stack, I don't need direct pot odds - I just need to preserve my stack while getting a cheap look at the flop.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider the stack size. It says \"79 chips (2.5 BB)\". If 2.5 BB = 79, then BB = 31.6, which is roughly 32. So blinds are 16/32, and my stack is about 2.5 BB.\n\n\nMy tournament life is at stake with this short stack. A standard raise would be 2.5x BB at 80 chips, which essentially puts me all-in. \n\nI see two strategic options:\n1. Go all-in preflop with pocket 4s\n2. Call the 16 and hope for a favorable flop\n\nThe all-in move would be around 2.5x BB, which might not generate enough fold equity. I'm in a critical position where every chip matters, and my pocket pair gives me a potential shot at doubling up.\n\nWith only 2.5 BB remaining, my options are extremely limited. The preflop check from the small blind suggests I might have some fold equity, but it's not guaranteed. My best move is to shove all-in and hope for a fold or a favorable showdown.\n\nThe key is maximizing my chances of survival with this marginal hand and critically low stack. An all-in push gives me the highest probability of either stealing the blinds or getting a chance to double up.",

This is a trash hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (Button), which is the best position post-flop, but with this hand it doesn't matter much.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have only 47 chips (1.5 BB), which is extremely short-stacked. I'm in critical tournament survival mode.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 48 chips, and I need to call 16 chips. That's 3:1 pot odds. However, with 8-3 offsuit, my equity is terrible against any reasonable range.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the opponent data:\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been active with various actions: raises, calls, checks, folds\n   - They've shown down some decent hands (AA, AK, 66, etc.)\n   - They seem to be a solid player with a large stack (853 chips)\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With only 1.5 BB left, I'm in desperation mode. However, 8-3 offsuit is one of the worst hands in poker. Even if I shove all-in (47 chips), I'm likely dominated by any hand that calls.\n\n7. **The play**: I posted the SB (16 chips), so I need to put in 16 more to call the BB. If I call, I'll have 31 chips left (less than 1 BB), which makes me even more committed on the flop. \n\nThe correct play here is to **fold**. Even though I'm extremely short-stacked, 8-3 offsuit has such poor equity that it's not worth the investment. I should wait for a better spot - even any face card or pocket pair would be better. The 3:1 pot odds don't compensate for the terrible hand strength.\n\nI cannot raise because it's not in my legal actions, and even if I could, going all-in with 8-3 offsuit would be a poor decision against a player who can easily call with any reasonable hand.\n \nFolding is the wisest move to preserve my minimal tournament life for a more favorable opportunity.",

Let me recalculate:\n- Blinds are 16/32, meaning SB is 16, BB is 32\n- I posted BB of 32, but my stack is only 15 chips? That doesn't make sense.\n- Actually, looking more carefully: \"Your Stack: 15 chips (0.5 BB)\" and \"Blinds: 16/32\"\n- If BB is 32 chips, and I have 15 chips, that's less than 0.5 BB (15/32 = 0.47)\n- The pot is 96 chips: 16 (SB) + 32 (BB) + 64 (raise) = 112, but it says 96... hmm\n\nLet me think about the actual situation:\n- I have 15 chips total\n- I already posted BB of 32, but I only have 15 chips? This means I must have been all-in for the BB\n- Seat 2 raised to 64\n- Amount to call is listed as 32\n\nActually, I think the \"15 chips (0.5 BB)\" means I have 15 big blinds, not 15 chips. Let me reconsider:\n- If I have 15 BB and blinds are 16/32, that would be 15 * 32 = 480 chips\n- But it says \"15 chips\" not \"15 BB\"\n\nI think there's confusion in the notation. Let me look at what's clear:\n- My cards: 2c 5c - This is a very weak hand\n- I'm in BB position\n- One opponent (Seat 2) has raised\n- I can fold or call\n\nWith 2c 5c, this is one of the worst starting hands in poker. I'm out of position against a raiser. Even if I'm short stacked, this is a clear fold. The only reason to consider calling would be if I'm getting incredible pot odds and I'm already all-in or nearly all-in.\n\nGiven that I have to call 32 chips, and the pot is 96, I'm getting 3:1 pot odds. But with 2-5 offsuit (even suited), I have very poor equity against any reasonable raising range. \n\nLet me make a decision: I should fold this hand. It's too weak to continue with.",

T3 is not a playable hand in most situations.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (button) - This is the best position, but it doesn't matter much with this hand.\n\n3. **My stack**: 14 chips (0.4 BB) - This is extremely short! I'm in a desperate situation with less than half a big blind.\n\n4. **Blinds**: 16/32 - The big blind is 32 chips, but I only have 14 chips total.\n\n5. **Pot**: 48 chips (16 from SB + 32 from BB)\n\n6. **Amount to call**: 16 - Since I posted the small blind of 16, I need to put in 16 more chips to call.\n\n7. **Legal actions**: fold or call (can't raise because the minimum raise to 64 is more than my stack)\n\nGiven that I only have 14 chips total and the big blind is 32, I'm already all-in for less than the big blind. I've posted 16 chips as the small blind, leaving me with -2 chips (which doesn't make sense mathematically, but the system shows I have 14 chips remaining after posting SB).\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n- I posted SB of 16 chips\n- I have 14 chips remaining\n- That means I started with 30 chips\n- BB is 32 chips\n- To call, I would need to match the BB of 32, but I only have 14 chips left\n\nSo the \"amount to call: 16\" means I need to put in 16 more chips to complete my call, and I'll be all-in.\n\nWith Th 3h:\n- This is a terrible hand\n- I'm extremely short stacked (0.4 BB)\n- I have pot odds of (48 + 16) / 16 = 4 to 1\n- I need roughly 25% equity to break even on this call\n\nLet me think about tournament equity:\n- With 0.4 BB, I'm in a desperate spot\n\n\n- I need to take almost any opportunity to double up\n- The suited hand offers a slim chance of improvement\n- Calling is essentially a last-ditch effort to survive\n\nIn this critical tournament moment, the marginal pot odds and desperate stack size make calling the most logical, albeit risky, move. The suited cards provide just enough potential to justify the all-in call.\n\nI'll make a stand and call, hoping to catch a favorable flop and potentially double my meager stack.",

It's not strong enough to raise with from early position.\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I have to act first on every street.\n3. **Stack size**: I have 200 chips (100 BB), which is a good starting stack.\n4. **Opponents**: Limited info, but from hand #1, it seems players are folding to raises. MiniMax-M2 folded on the button in hand #1, suggesting they might be tight.\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 chips to win 3 chips (1.5:1 pot odds). Not great with a weak hand.\n6. **Tournament considerations**: Early in tournament, I should be conservative and avoid marginal spots.\n\nQ8o from UTG is a clear fold.

This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. After I act, 4 more players will act behind me. With a weak hand like J6o, there's a very high chance someone behind me has a much better hand.\n\n**Stack Size:**\nI have 100 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take risks with marginal hands.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nEarly in a tournament with 100 BB, I should be playing tight, especially from early position. I want to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nPot is 3, I need to call 2. That's 3:2 or 1.5:1 pot odds. While these odds aren't terrible, they're not relevant here because my hand is so weak and I'm out of position.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nI should check if I have any information about the opponents, but from UTG with J6o, this is a clear fold regardless of opponent tendencies.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. J6 offsuit is not a profitable hand to play from UTG. I should wait for better hands and better positions.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold based on fundamental poker strategy.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3h 7c - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected with a 4-gap. This is typically a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (Button), which is the best position post-flop. However, I have a very weak hand.\n\n3. **Stack**: I have 198 chips (99 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - SB posted 1 chip\n   - I posted BB 2 chips\n   - Everyone folded to SB (GPT-OSS-120B) who raised to 4\n   - I need to call 2 more chips to see a flop\n\n5. **Opponent info**: GPT-OSS-120B has been very passive:\n   - Folded first 2 hands preflop\n   - In hand #3, they checked all streets (preflop through river)\n   - This suggests they might be a tight/passive player\n   \n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is currently 6 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 4 raise)\n   - I need to call 2 chips\n   - Pot odds: 6:2 or 3:1\n   - With 3:1 odds, I need ~25% equity to break even\n\n7. **Hand equity**: 3-7 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. Against a typical raising range, I likely have less than 25% equity.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I have a healthy stack at 99 BB\n   - No need to take marginal spots\n   - Better to wait for better hands/positions\n\nEven though I'm getting 3:1 pot odds and I have position, 3-7 offsuit is just too weak. The opponent's raise suggests they have a real hand (though they could be making a small steal attempt from SB). With my healthy stack, I should preserve chips and wait for better spots.\n\nThe only argument for calling is the small investment (2 chips) and good position, but even then, 3-7o is rarely going to win, and I don't want to get into trouble post-flop with such a weak hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand**: 3s Qh (Queen high, offsuit, with a low kicker)\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Best position postflop\n**Stack**: 197 chips (98.5 BB) - Very healthy stack\n**Pot**: 3 chips\n**To call**: 1 chip (half a big blind)\n\n**Opponent info**: Kimi-K2 has folded in 3 out of 4 hands preflop, raised once to 6 chips. Sample is small but suggests they might be somewhat tight.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Q3 offsuit is a very weak hand. Even though I have a Queen, the 3 kicker is terrible. This hand is in the bottom 20% of starting hands.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is great, but that matters more postflop. Preflop, position helps but doesn't make up for a terrible hand.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 1 to win 3, so 3:1 pot odds. This is attractive, but with Q3o, even these odds don't justify calling. I need roughly 25% equity to break even, and Q3o against a random hand has about 45% equity, BUT...\n\n4. **Opponent's range**: The BB (Kimi-K2) has shown some tightness. When they defend their BB, they'll likely have better hands than Q3o. Against a reasonable defending range, Q3o has terrible equity.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 98.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. There's no need to get involved with marginal situations. Preserving my stack and waiting for better spots is the correct tournament strategy.\n\n6. **Postflop playability**: Q3o has terrible playability. If I hit a Queen, I'll be dominated by better kickers. If I hit a 3, it's rarely good. The hand is not suited, so no flush potential.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. The tiny investment of 1 chip might seem insignificant, but it's -EV in the long run. Tournament poker is about preserving chips for good spots, not getting involved with trash hands even when getting good pot odds.\n\nI'll fold and wait for a better hand/situation.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**Hand Information:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - excellent position\n- Cards: 9s 6c - offsuit, low suited connector (very weak hand)\n- Stack: 197 chips (98.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- To call: 2 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Folded 3 out of 4 times preflop, raised once (to 6). Limited data but seems somewhat tight.\n- Seat 3 (BB): Folded all 4 recorded preflop hands. Very tight player so far.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 9s 6c is a very weak hand, unsuited and not connected enough to have good implied odds. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: While being on the button is excellent, it doesn't make up for the poor hand quality.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: Both opponents appear to be on the tighter side based on limited data, which means if I call and hit something, they might be more likely to have strong hands and pay me off. However, this is speculative with such limited data.\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3, so 1.5:1 pot odds. With 9s 6c, I'd need much better odds to justify playing this hand.\n\n5. **Stack Size**: I have a healthy stack and don't need to take risks with marginal hands. Preserving my stack is important in tournament play.\n\n6. **Implied Odds**: Even if I hit a 9 or 6, I'll often be dominated by better kickers. If I hit a straight (very unlikely), it could be well-disguised, but the probability is too low to justify the call.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, the pot odds aren't good enough, and I don't need to take unnecessary risks with a healthy stack. Playing 9-6 offsuit from any position is generally a losing play long-term.",

It's unsuited, not connected, and both cards are low.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is decent position postflop, but we're still preflop.\n\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 has been very tight - they folded in 7 out of 10 recent hands, and the only time they called was when they could just limp in for 1 chip (when they were in SB). They haven't shown any aggression.\n\n4. **Action**: MiniMax-M2 just called 2 chips (limped in). This could mean:\n   - They have a marginal hand they want to see a flop with cheaply\n   - They have a strong hand trying to trap\n   - Given their tight history, more likely a marginal hand\n\n5. **Pot odds**: There's 5 chips in the pot (1 SB + 2 BB + 2 call). I can check for free since I'm in BB.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 195 chips (97.5 BB), which is a healthy stack. I don't need to take risks with a terrible hand like 83o.\n\n7. **Postflop potential**: Even if I flop something with 83o, it's unlikely to be the best hand. If I flop an 8, I'm likely dominated by better 8s. If I flop a 3, same issue. If I flop two pair, I'm still vulnerable. The only good scenario is flopping a straight or trips, which is very unlikely (about 1.3% chance).\n\nThe opponent is tight and just limped. I should check and see the flop for free. There's no reason to raise with this garbage hand. I could fold, but checking is free and gives me a chance to see if I hit a miracle flop. However, I need to be prepared to fold to any aggression postflop unless I hit something very strong.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - I have one of the worst hands in poker. Even checking could lead me into trouble postflop. The best play is probably to just check and see the flop since it's free, but be very ready to fold to any bet unless I hit a monster.\n\nI'll check and see the flop.",

No pair, no draw, no backdoor flush/straight potential worth pursuing.\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position, which is bad for bluffing.\n3. **Opponent Tendency**: MiniMax-M2 is very tight. If they called preflop, they likely have something. Bluffing a tight player who likely has a real hand is not profitable.\n4. **Pot Size**: The pot is tiny (5 chips), not worth fighting for.\n5. **Stack Preservation**: I have a healthy stack of 195 chips. No need to risk chips in a bad spot.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear check/fold situation. I should check and fold to any bet. Checking gives me a free chance to see if I improve (though it's very unlikely with 8-high), and folding to any aggression is the correct play.\n\nSince the amount to call is 0, I should check.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: 8d 3s - This is a very weak hand with no connection to the board. I have 8-high with no flush draw, straight draw, or pair.\n\n2. **The board**: Qd 6h 4c - The flop has a Queen and some lower cards. I have absolutely nothing here.\n\n3. **The action**: \n   - Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called from position (seat 4)\n   - I checked in BB\n   - On the flop, I checked and MiniMax-M2 bet 2 chips into a 7 chip pot\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n   - Very tight player who has folded preflop most hands (hands 1,2,4,5,6,7,8)\n   - Only played hand #3 where they called preflop and then checked down all streets\n   - This is the first time I've seen them bet postflop\n\n5. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is 7 chips\n   - Bet is 2 chips\n   - I need to call 2 to win 9 (pot + opponent's bet)\n   - That's 22% equity needed\n\n6. **My equity**: I have 8-high. I need to hit an 8 to have any chance, but even then I could be beaten by:\n   - Any pair (Q, 6, or 4)\n   - Any higher card\n   - Any future cards that give opponent a better hand\n   \n   I have 3 outs (the remaining 8s), which is roughly 12% equity on the flop. This is well below the 22% I need.\n\n7. **Position**: I'm out of position which makes it harder to control the pot or bluff later.\n\n8. **Stack size**: I have 195 chips which is healthy at 97.5 BB. No need to make desperate calls.\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: This is a trivial call in terms of chips, but it's a -EV play. Calling here would be throwing away 2 chips with a very weak hand against a tight opponent who likely has something when they bet.\n\nThe decision is clear: fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My position: BTN (Button)\n- My cards: 8s 4c (suited - spades)\n- My stack: 194 chips (97 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- Amount to call: 1 (to complete the SB)\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 8s 4c is a very weak hand, even though it's suited\n- From the button, I have position advantage\n- It's only 1 chip to call (half a BB)\n- I have a deep stack (97 BB)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nThe opponent in BB (Kimi-K2) has shown the following preflop patterns:\n- Hand 1: fold\n- Hand 2: raise to 6\n- Hand 3: fold\n- Hand 4: fold\n- Hand 6: fold\n- Hand 7: raise to 6\n- Hand 8: raise to 8\n- Hand 9: fold\n\nSo out of 8 hands, they've raised 3 times (hands 2, 7, 8) and folded 5 times. The raises have been to 6 or 8 chips. This suggests they defend their BB somewhat aggressively but not always.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak - 84s is a trash hand\n2. **Position**: Excellent (on the button)\n3. **Pot odds**: Very good - calling 1 to win 3 (3:1)\n4. **Implied odds**: Minimal with this hand\n5. **Opponent tendency**: BB seems to defend with raises sometimes (3/8 times)\n6. **Tournament situation**: Deep stacked, can afford to see flops with marginal hands in position\n\n**Considerations:**\n- If I call 1 chip and BB raises, I'll have to fold and lose that chip\n- If I fold, I lose 1 chip (the SB)\n- The hand is very weak but the price is cheap\n- In position, I can often win pots postflop even with weak hands\n- However, 84s has very poor equity against any reasonable defending range\n\n**Recommendation**: \nDespite the good pot odds and position, 84s is just too weak to play profitably. The opponent has shown they defend their BB with raises about 37.5% of the time, and when they do raise, I'll have to fold my 1 chip investment. Even when they don't raise, I'll be out of position postflop (wait, no - I'm on the button, so I have position), but with a hand that rarely makes strong hands.\n\n\nFolding this hand is the most disciplined play, preserving chips for better opportunities. The minimal potential gain doesn't justify the risk with such a weak hand. I'll cut my losses and wait for a stronger starting hand that offers more strategic potential.",

King is decent but 4 kicker is very weak.\n- Not suited, not connected, poor playability postflop\n\n**Position:** Button (BTN) - Best position at the table\n- I act last postflop, which is advantageous\n- Can see what others do before acting\n\n**Stack:** 194 chips (97 BB) - Healthy stack, deep tournament stack\n\n**Current situation:**\n- SB posted 1 chip\n- BB posted 2 chips\n- Pot is 3 chips\n- I need to call 2 chips to see flop\n- Min raise is 4 chips\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) in SB: Mix of folds and raises. Has raised to 6 chips (3x) and 8 chips (4x) in previous hands. Seems to be an active player who raises with decent hands.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) in BB: Has folded every single preflop action in the last 8 hands! This is extremely tight/nitty play. They fold to any pressure.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Very weak. K4o is not a hand I want to play, especially from early position. But I'm on the button.\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is great, but with such a weak hand, position advantage is limited.\n3. **Opponents:** The BB player folds 100% of the time to any action. The SB player is active but has shown they can fold too.\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 2 chips to win 3 chips (1.5:1). Not great odds for a weak hand.\n5. **Steal opportunity:** Given that BB folds 100% of the time, this is a perfect steal situation. If I raise, BB will likely fold, and SB might fold too.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear steal situation. The BB player is extremely tight and folds everything. Even with a weak hand like K4o, raising from the button against a tight BB is profitable. The SB player is also capable of folding.\n\nI should raise to steal the blinds. A standard raise of 2.5x-3x the BB would be 5-6 chips. Given the SB player's pattern of raising to 6 chips, I'll raise to 6 chips which is 3x the BB.\n\nThis is a low-risk, high-reward play. If both fold, I win 3 chips (1.5% of my stack). If I get called, I have position and a King which has some showdown value.\n\nLet me raise to 6 chips.",

This suggests they're playing very tight. They called my preflop raise of 6 chips, which is unusual for them. The board is Ah 9s 7s - they could have:\n- An Ace (likely given they called preflop)\n- A pocket pair\n- Some spade draw\n- Straight draw (8-T)\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n- I have K-high with no pair\n- Backdoor flush draw (need two more spades)\n- No straight draw\n- My King is dominated if they have any Ace\n\n**Position & Action:**\n- I'm in position (BTN)\n- They checked to me on the flop\n- Pot is 13, I can check for free\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Checking costs me nothing\n- Raising would be minimum 4 chips (to 17 total)\n- Pot would be 30 if I bet and they call\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nDeepSeek-V3.2 is very tight - they've folded 8 hands in a row preflop. The fact they called preflop suggests they have something. On this Ace-high board, they likely have:\n- An Ace (A-x)\n- A pocket pair (maybe 99, 77, or TT-QQ)\n- A flush draw with spades\n- Possibly a straight draw\n\n**Decision:**\nI have a very weak hand (K-high) on an Ace-high board with some draws. My opponent is tight and checked to me. I should check behind here because:\n1. I have very little equity with just K-high\n2. My opponent is tight and called preflop, suggesting they have something\n3. I'm in position and can see a free card\n4. If I bet, I'm unlikely to get folds from any Ace, pair, or draw\n5. Checking preserves my stack and allows me to potentially hit a spade flush or see if they show weakness on later streets\n\nThe only consideration for betting would be as a bluff, but against a tight opponent who called preflop on an Ace-high board, this bluff is unlikely to succeed.\n\nI should check.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with Ks 4d\n- Stack: 188 chips (94 BB)\n- Board: Ah 9s 7s 6d\n- Pot: 13 chips\n- It's the turn, and Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has checked to me\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check for free)\n- Minimum raise to: 4\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have Ks 4d\n- Board shows Ah 9s 7s 6d\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 5 to complete 4-5-6-7-8 or 5-6-7-8-9)\n- I have a flush draw with Ks (but the Ace of spades is on board, so my flush would be vulnerable)\n- Actually wait, let me re-evaluate: I have Ks, board has Ah 9s 7s 6d. So I have a flush draw with 3 spades on board (Ah, 9s, 7s) plus my Ks. So I need one more spade for a flush.\n\n**Outs:**\n- Straight draw: I need an 8 for a straight (4-5-6-7-8 or 5-6-7-8-9). Actually with 4-6-7-9 on board, I could make a straight with 5 or 8. Wait, let me count again: I have 4d, board is Ah 9s 7s 6d. So I have 4-6-7-9. I need a 5 or 8 for a straight. That's 8 outs.\n- Flush draw: I have Ks and there are 2 spades on board (9s, 7s). So I need another spade. There are 13 spades total, 3 are visible (my Ks, 9s, 7s). So 10 spades left. But some of these might be straight outs already counted. The 5s and 8s would give me a straight flush possibility. So I need to be careful not to double-count.\n\n\n- My total outs are approximately 15, considering the overlap between straight and flush possibilities\n- This gives me around a 30% chance of hitting my hand by the river\n\n**Position and betting:**\n- I'm in position on the button\n- My opponent checked, indicating potential weakness\n- The pot is relatively small at 13 chips\n- A value bet could be effective, but I must consider my opponent's potential responses\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- Checking allows me to see the river card for free\n- Betting could protect my draw and potentially win the pot immediately\n- My opponent's passive play suggests they might have a marginal hand\n\nI'll analyze my opponent's playing style carefully. With a 194-chip stack and 97 BB, they're in a solid position. Checking twice often signals weakness or a marginal holding like a small pair or draw. The preflop call suggests a moderately strong starting hand, possibly a pocket pair or suited connectors.\n\nTheir preflop call indicates they likely have something interesting, but not a premium hand. The postflop checks hint at uncertainty or a desire to control the pot size. I'll need to weigh the potential risks and rewards of different betting strategies carefully.\n\nMy stack size provides flexibility, allowing for strategic aggression without immediate danger. The current board texture offers multiple potential draws and interesting possibilities for both players.\n\nI have 15 outs, giving me approximately a 30% chance of improving my hand. The pot odds suggest checking might be the most prudent move right now. While a semi-bluff could potentially win the pot immediately, my opponent's passive play indicates they might be waiting for a strong hand. Checking allows me to see the next card without additional risk, preserving my tournament position and maintaining strategic flexibility.\n\nThe key consideration is balancing potential improvement against unnecessary chip expenditure. With a decent draw but uncertain board dynamics, a cautious approach seems most appropriate.\n\nChecking provides a free opportunity to develop my hand, which aligns with the current strategic assessment of minimizing risk while maintaining potential for future action.\n\nA semi-bluff bet of 4 chips could be an alternative approach, but without clear opponent reads, the conservative check remains the most prudent play.",

Let me analyze:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My hand: Ks 4d (King of spades, 4 of diamonds)\n- Board: Ah 9s 7s 6d Th\n- I have King high only. The board shows: Ace, 9, 7, 6, 10\n- No pair, no straight (I don't have an 8 for a straight), no flush (I only have one spade)\n- Best hand I can make is Ace-high (using the Ace on board), but I lose to any pair\n\n**Situation:**\n- Opponent: DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB\n- They bet 6 into a pot of 19\n- I need to call 6 to win 25 (pot odds: 6/25 = 24%)\n- They called preflop from BB, then checked flop and turn, now betting river\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 called from BB preflop (could have many hands)\n- Checked twice, now betting river - this is often a value bet\n- The board has multiple straight possibilities (8 would complete straight), and a flush draw that missed\n- Their river bet suggests they have something - could be:\n  - A pair (any Ace, 9, 7, 6, 10)\n  - Two pair\n  - Set\n  - Or could be a bluff trying to represent the Ace or a made hand\n\n**My situation:**\n- I have pure air - just King high\n- I cannot beat ANY pair\n- I lose to any Ace, 9, 7, 6, 10\n- Even if they have a missed flush draw, they still have Ace high which beats my King high\n- The only hands I beat are complete bluffs with worse high cards\n\n**Pot odds:** 24% - I need to be good 24% of the time to break even\n**But:** Against a river bet after checking twice, the bluff frequency is likely low. Most players don't bluff rivers often, especially in small pots.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** \n- I have 188 chips (94 BB) - healthy stack\n- Losing 6 chips won't hurt much\n- But calling with pure air is -EV against most opponents\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. I have no showdown value and am unlikely to be ahead. The opponent's betting pattern suggests they have something, and even if they're bluffing, I only beat some bluffs (they could have Queen high, Jack high, etc. which still beat my King high in some cases).\n\nI should fold here.",

Let me analyze their pattern:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n- They raised to 4 in hand #4 as well\n- In hand #3 they went to showdown with 2s 5s (a very weak offsuit hand)\n- Their raise size is consistent at 4 chips (2x the big blind)\n\nThis suggests they might be playing somewhat loose/weak. The raise to 4 could be:\n1. A standard opening with a decent hand\n2. A steal attempt \n3. A weak hand trying to see a flop cheaply\n\nMy hand Qs Jd is a decent hand in CO position:\n- Suited queen is good\n- Can make strong top pairs, straights, flushes\n- I'm 94 BB deep which is comfortable\n- There's only one player behind me (Seat 2)\n\nThe pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 7 (SB+BB+raise), so about 1.75:1 or 36% equity needed. QJs definitely has that against a typical raising range.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and the opponent's tendency to fold a lot preflop, I should either:\n1. Call and see a flop in position\n2. Raise to isolate and potentially take it down preflop\n\nA raise would be good because:\n- I have position post-flop\n- The opponent folds a lot, so I might win immediately\n- If they call, I have a strong hand that plays well post-flop\n- I can control the pot size\n\nLet me make a standard raise to about 12-14 chips (3x their raise). That would be to 14-16 total, but minimum raise is 6. I think 12-14 is good.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With QJs in the CO facing a min-raise from a loose player who folds a lot, I should be aggressive. I'll raise to 12 chips total (3x their raise).",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand details:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- Cards: Qs Jd (offsuit)\n- Stack: 176 chips (88 BB)\n- Board: 2c Kd 9h\n- Pot: 27 chips\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5)\n\n**Preflop action:**\n- Seat 5 raised to 4\n- I 3-bet to 12\n- Seat 5 called 8\n\n**Flop action:**\n- Seat 5 checked\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Minimum raise: 8\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have QJ offsuit\n- Board: 2c Kd 9h\n- I missed the flop completely - no pair, no straight draw, no flush draw\n- Only backdoor straight possibilities (need 10 then K, or 10 then 8, etc.)\n\n**Opponent tendencies (from recall):**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's actions:\n- Very tight preflop: folded 7 hands in a row (hands 5-11)\n- Only played hand #4 preflop with a raise\n- In hand #3, they checked turn and river\n- They called my 3-bet preflop, which suggests some strength\n\n**Opponent's likely range:**\nGiven they called my 3-bet after being tight, they likely have:\n- Pocket pairs: 99-QQ, possibly KK/AA\n- Big Broadway cards: AQ, AJ, KQ\n- Maybe some suited connectors\n\n**Board texture:**\n- Dry board with K-9-2 rainbow\n- King is high card\n- Not many draws possible\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak - just Q-high\n2. **Position**: I'm in position (on the button), which is good\n3. **Opponent's action**: They checked to me - could be weak or trapping\n4. **Pot size**: 27 chips, which is about 15% of my stack\n5. **Continuation bet**: Standard play would be to c-bet here since I was the aggressor preflop\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: Take a free card, see if I improve on turn. I have 6 outs to a pair (3 Qs, 3 Js), plus backdoor draws.\n- **Bet**: Standard c-bet to represent the King and try to take down the pot. Bet sizing would be around 13-18 chips (half pot to 2/3 pot).\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (88 BB)\n- This is a small pot relative to my stack\n- Taking down 27 chips would be a nice win\n\n**Opponent's check:**\nCould mean:\n1. They missed the flop completely and are giving up\n2. They have a medium-strength hand and want to pot control\n3. They're trapping with a monster (KK, 99, 22, AK)\n\nGiven their tight nature, if they had a monster like a set or top two, they might be more likely to bet for value. The check suggests weakness more often than not.\n\n**My decision:**\nI should make a continuation bet here. As the preflop aggressor, betting the flop is standard and represents strength. Even though I missed, the opponent's check suggests weakness, and I can take down this pot a good percentage of the time.\n\nBet sizing: About 14-16 chips (slightly over half pot) seems appropriate. This puts pressure on opponent without risking too much of my stack.\n\nMinimum raise is 8, but that seems too small for a c-bet. I should bet around 14-16.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the raise_to value. The minimum raise to is 8, which means total bet of 8. But that's only 8 chips into a 27 chip pot - too small. \n\nWait, I need to understand the betting structure better. The \"minimum raise to\" means the smallest TOTAL amount I can put in if I raise. So if I raise to 8, I'm betting 8 chips total (not adding 8 to something).\n\nFor a proper c-bet, I should bet around 14-18 chips. Let me bet 16, which is about 60% of pot - a standard c-bet size.\n\nFinal decision: Raise to 16 (bet 16 chips).",

T2o is one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act postflop against potentially many opponents\n3. **Stack size**: I have a healthy stack of 101.5 BB, so I should be selective\n4. **Tournament**: Early tournament play favors tight, solid play\n\nFrom UTG with T2o, this is a clear fold.

This is a very strong hand (three of a kind).\n\n**Board**: Jc 5c 3c - There are three clubs on the board, so there's a potential flush draw. However, I have a set, which is still very strong.\n\n**Position**: I'm in BB and it's checked to me. MiniMax-M2 is the only other player.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- Very tight player - has folded preflop 12 out of 14 hands\n- Only called preflop twice (hands 3 and 9)\n- In hand 9, they called preflop and then bet 2 on the flop\n- No showdowns seen, so we don't know what cards they play\n\n**Pot**: Currently 5 chips\n**My Stack**: 201 chips (very healthy)\n\n**Decision**: I have a strong hand (set of 3s) but the board is dangerous with 3 clubs. However, my opponent is very tight. I should bet for value here. The question is how much.\n\nGiven the board texture (3 clubs) and that my opponent is tight, they likely have something if they're continuing. I should make a solid value bet to protect against the flush draw and get value from weaker hands.\n\nA bet of 4-6 chips seems appropriate - enough to charge flush draws but not so big that I only get called by flushes. Let me bet 5 chips (pot-sized bet).\n\nWait, let me check what the minimum raise is. The minimum raise to is 2, but that's the total amount, which doesn't make sense because the pot is 5. Let me think... actually \"minimum raise to: 2\" probably means I can raise to at least 2 chips total, but that would just be a check since the current bet is 0. \n\nActually, rereading: \"Amount to call: 0\" means it's checked to me. So I can check or raise. A raise of 2 would mean I'm betting 2 chips total.\n\nGiven I have a strong hand, I should bet. I'll make it 5 chips (a pot-sized bet) to protect against flush draws and get value.",

This is their first raise in the last 15 hands.\n\nI have TT (tens) on the BTN. This is a strong hand, especially against a tight player. I should consider:\n1. 3-betting for value - TT is ahead of a tight player's raising range\n2. The raise size is 8 (4bb), which is standard\n3. I have 102.5bb, plenty deep\n4.

          "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket tens (Td Tc) and the flop comes Th 3s Qc, giving me three of a kind (tens). This is a very strong hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have trip tens (three of a kind). The board shows Th 3s Qc. There are no flush or straight draws immediately visible. I have the best possible hand right now unless my opponent has Q-Q (pocket queens) for a higher set.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is excellent position.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Only DeepSeek-V3.2 is still in the hand. Looking at their history:\n   - They've been very tight, folding most preflop hands\n   - They raised preflop to 8 (4 BB), so they likely have a strong hand\n   - They called my 3-bet to 30, indicating real strength\n   - Based on their tight play, they likely have: QQ, AQ, KQ, QJ, or maybe a strong pocket pair like JJ or AA/KK\n\n4. **Pot size**: 62 chips\n   - Preflop: 1 (SB) + 2 (BB) + 8 (raise) + 30 (my 3-bet) + 22 (call) = 63 chips, but shown as 62\n   - My stack: 176 - 30 = 146 chips remaining\n\n5. **Board texture**: Th 3s Qc\n   - I have trip tens\n   - Possible opponent hands:\n     - QQ: They have a set of queens (beating me badly)\n     - AQ: They have top pair top kicker\n     - KQ/QJ: They have top pair\n     - AA/KK: They have an overpair\n     - QT: They have two pair (unlikely given my tens)\n   \n6. **Action**: It's checked to me (amount to call is 0). I should bet for value here.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing:\n- The pot is 62 chips\n- I have 146 chips left\n- I want to get value from top pair hands (AQ, KQ, QJ) and overpairs (AA, KK)\n- I also need to protect against draws (though there aren't many obvious ones)\n- A bet of about 2/3 pot (40-45 chips) seems appropriate\n\nHowever, I should also consider that this opponent is tight. If they have QQ, I'm crushed. But if they have AQ or KQ, I want to get value. Given their tight nature and the fact they called my 3-bet, QQ is definitely in their range, but it's only one hand combination.\n\nThe most likely scenario is they have AQ or KQ and I have the best hand. I should bet for value.\n\nMinimum raise is 22, which would be a very small bet (less than half pot). I should bet more.\n\nLet me bet 45 chips, which is about 72% of pot - a solid value bet that builds the pot while still getting calls from top pair hands.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent data:\n\n**Seat 2 (SB - Kimi-K2):**\n- Very tight player - folded 8 out of 10 times preflop\n- Only raised 3 times (hands 7, 8, 13) with amounts 6, 8, and 6\n- Seems to have a narrow raising range\n\n**Seat 3 (BB - DeepSeek-V3.2):**\n- More active than SB\n- Called once (hand 11), folded several times\n- Made a significant raise in hand 15 (8 chips) and then called 22 more\n- Shows willingness to defend BB but also can fold\n\n**My situation:**\n- Position: Button (best position)\n- Hand: 9d Td (suited connector, decent but not premium)\n- Stack: 238 chips (119 BB) - very healthy\n- To call: 2 chips\n- Pot: 3 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 9d Td is a suited connector with good playability, especially in position. Can make straights and flushes. Decent stealing hand on the button.\n\n2. **Position**: Button is excellent position - I get to act last postflop.\n\n3. **Opponents**: SB is very tight (80% fold rate). BB is more defend-y but still folds a fair amount. Both are likely to fold to a raise.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Calling 2 to win 3 = 40% immediate pot odds. Not great for a marginal hand, but position and implied odds help.\n\n5. **Tournament**: With 119 BB, I have a healthy stack. This is a good spot to either:\n   - Steal the blinds with a raise\n   - Call and play a speculative hand in position\n\nGiven that the SB folds 80% of the time and I'm on the button with a suited connector, this is a good spot to raise and try to steal the blinds. A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 6 chips, but since there's already 1 from SB and 2 from BB, raising to 6 total seems appropriate.\n\nIf I raise to 6:\n- SB would need to call 5 more\n- BB would need to call 4 more\n- Both have shown willingness to fold, especially SB\n\nThis is a clear raise situation to try to steal the blinds with a hand that has good potential if called.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent \"Kimi-K2\" is in the big blind (seat 2). Looking at their preflop actions:\n\nThey fold quite often (11 folds out of 19 actions shown), but when they raise, it's consistently to 6 chips (3x the big blind) or 8 chips (4x the big blind). This suggests they have a somewhat tight but aggressive style when they do enter pots.\n\nI have pocket 5s (5c 5s) on the button. This is a decent hand in position. Let me think about the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Pocket 5s is a medium pocket pair. It has good potential to make a set (about 12% chance on the flop) but is vulnerable to overcards.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position postflop.\n3. **Stack size**: I have 238 chips (119 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n4. **Opponent**: The big blind has shown a pattern of folding often but raising to 6-8 when they do play. This suggests they might defend their blind aggressively.\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 1 chip to win a pot of 3 chips, giving me 3:1 odds.\n\nGiven that I'm on the button with a pocket pair and position, and I only need to call 1 chip (0.5 BB) to see the flop, this is an easy call. Raising could also be an option, but with a small pocket pair, I prefer to see a cheap flop and try to hit a set. The opponent seems to fold a lot, but when they raise, they raise big. If I raise to 4 (minimum), they might re-raise to 6 or 8, which would put me in a tough spot with 5s.\n\nI think calling is the best play here. It's cheap, I'm in position, and I have implied odds if I hit my set.\n\nLet me make the call.",

The board shows Q-8-9 rainbow. This is a dangerous board with multiple overcards. I have an underpair to the board.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is favorable position.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Based on the data, Kimi-K2 is very tight and only raises with strong hands. They checked preflop after I called from SB, which suggests they don't have a premium hand, but they could have:\n   - AQ, KQ, QJ (top pair)\n   - JT (straight draw)\n   - 98, 87 (second pair)\n   - Or air that they're willing to check down\n\n4. **Board texture**: Q-8-9 is coordinated. There are straight draws (JT, T7, 76) and the opponent could easily have top pair with a Q.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is only 4 chips. Checking costs me nothing to see the turn.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack of 118.5 BB. I don't need to take unnecessary risks with an underpair on a dangerous board against a tight player.\n\n**Decision**: The opponent checked to me. I have a weak underpair on a board with overcards and potential straight draws. Against a tight player who only raises with strong hands, I should be cautious. The best play here is to check and see a free turn card. If I bet, a tight player will likely only continue with hands that beat me (top pair+, strong draws), and I don't want to build a big pot with such a marginal hand.\n\nBetting would be a bluff, which might work against some opponents, but against a tight player who checked, they might check-call with any Q, any 9, any 8, or a draw. The risk isn't worth the small reward of 4 chips.\n\nI should check and see what develops on the turn.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the situation:\n\n**My hand**: 5c 5s (pocket fives)\n**Board**: Qc 8d 9s 5h\n**Position**: BTN (Seat 1)\n**Stack**: 237 chips\n**Pot**: 4 chips\n\n**Current situation**: I have a set of fives! The board is Q-8-9-5. There's a possible straight draw (J-T would make a straight), and two clubs on board (Qc and 5h is not a club, wait 5h is hearts). Actually board has Qc, 8d, 9s, 5h - so only Qc is a club.\n\nLet me check opponent actions. The opponent in Seat 2 is \"Kimi-K2\". Looking at their history:\n- They raise preflop quite often (hands 2, 7, 8, 13, 17)\n- They fold a lot preflop too\n- In hand 17, they raised preflop to 6, checked flop, then folded on turn\n\nIn this hand:\n- Preflop: I called from SB (1 chip), opponent checked from BB\n- Flop: I checked, opponent checked\n- Turn: It's on me now\n\nThe opponent checked twice now. This suggests weakness. They could have:\n- Nothing (complete air)\n- A weak pair\n- A draw\n- Maybe a strong hand trying to trap (less likely with two checks)\n\nI have a strong hand - a set. The board is somewhat coordinated with potential straight draws (J-T) and there are two cards to a flush (Qc and... wait, only Qc is a club. 8d, 9s, 5h are not clubs. So only one club).\n\nActually the board is: Qc 8d 9s 5h\n- Only Qc is a club, so no flush draw yet\n- Possible straight draws: J-T would make a straight\n- Possible two-pair combinations\n\nGiven that the opponent checked twice, they're likely weak. I should bet for value with my set. \n\nI need to extract maximum value from my strong hand. A small bet might entice calls from marginal hands while building the pot. The key is finding the right balance between getting paid and not scaring off potential callers. I'll consider a bet around 3-4 chips, which represents a solid value bet that most opponents would find difficult to fold against.\n\nThe board texture suggests potential straight draws, so I'll size my bet to charge those drawing hands. A 4-chip bet seems optimal - it's substantial enough to extract value while still inviting calls from weaker holdings. This approach balances pot-building with hand protection.\n\nMy 237-chip stack provides flexibility, allowing me to make this value bet without risking tournament life. The strategic bet size positions me well for future streets while maximizing potential returns.",

J9s has good potential for straights, flushes, and strong pairs. In position on the button against two relatively tight opponents, this is a profitable call. \n\nRaising could also be an option to try to steal the blinds, but with J9s I prefer to see a flop in position rather than turning this into a bluff preflop. The opponents are tight enough that they may fold to a raise, but calling keeps the pot small and allows me to use my positional advantage postflop.\n\n**Pot odds**: 4 to win 6 = 1.5:1. With a speculative hand like J9s, I don't need immediate pot odds to be huge since I'm playing for implied odds when I hit big.\n\nI'll call and see the flop in position.",

My opponent has checked twice, which could mean:\n- They're weak and want to see a free showdown\n- They have a made flush and are trapping\n- They have a club draw and want to see the river cheaply\n\nGiven that I have almost no equity (just a gutshot), I should not bet here. The only reasonable action is to check and see a free river card. I have position, so I can decide on the river based on what card comes and what my opponent does.\n\nBetting would be a pure bluff, and with this board texture (4 clubs), it's unlikely to succeed often enough to be profitable. My opponent could easily have a club and call, or they might check-raise with a made hand.\n\nI should check behind and see the river for free.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have 9d Jd (jack-high). The board is 8h 3c 5c 6c Kc. There are four clubs on the board, so a flush is possible. I have no clubs in my hand. My best hand is just jack-high with a 9 kicker. This is extremely weak.\n\n2. **Opponent behavior**: DeepSeek-V3.2 has been checking throughout this hand. Based on the recall data, this player has shown:\n   - They've been relatively tight (folding preflop many times)\n   - In hand 15, they raised preflop but folded on the flop\n   - In hand 17, they called preflop, checked flop, then bet on the turn\n   - In hand 18, they called preflop and bet on the flop\n   - In hand 11, they bet on the river\n\n   They seem capable of betting when they have something, but they also check-fold in many spots.\n\n3. **Board texture**: Four clubs on board means any club beats me. Also any pair beats me. This is a terrible board for my hand.\n\n4. **Pot size**: Only 10 chips. Very small pot.\n\n5. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good, but my hand is just too weak.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 237 chips (59.2 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to risk chips here.\n\nThe opponent has checked to me on the river. I have a pure bluff catcher at best (jack-high). Given that there are four clubs on board and my opponent has been passive, they could have:\n- A club (any club beats me)\n- Any pair (beats me)\n- Complete air (I might win)\n\nHowever, the fact that they've checked the river after checking flop and turn suggests they don't have a strong hand. They could be trying to get to showdown cheaply with a weak made hand.\n\nGiven my complete lack of showdown value and the fact that any club or any pair beats me, I should not try to bluff here. The opponent has shown they can call or bet in some spots, and this is a tournament where I don't want to spew chips.\n\nI should check back and hope my jack-high is good, but I'm not going to invest any more chips into this pot. The risk of being called by any pair or any club is too high, and I have no equity if called.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. Since they've checked to me and I've shown weakness throughout (checking flop and turn), I could potentially represent the flush. But this is risky because:\n1. The pot is tiny (10 chips)\n2. I have no blockers to the flush\n3. My opponent could easily have a club\n4. Tournament chips are valuable\n\nI think the correct play is to check back. The risk/reward of bluffing here is not favorable.",

It's not suited, not connected, and both cards are low.

Playing a weak hand from this position is very dangerous.\n\n**Opponent Information:**\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Posted SB, showed one preflop raise in hand #15. In hand #21 they showed down A-2o, suggesting they might play a wide range.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Posted BB, no preflop raises found. Showed down K-4o in hand #3, also suggesting a potentially wide range.\n\nEven though both opponents in the blinds seem to play wide ranges, my hand is simply too weak to play from UTG. The risk of running into a strong hand from any of the 3-4 players behind me is too high.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nPot is 6, need to call 4, so getting 1.5:1 odds.

It's suited which gives some potential, but it's easily dominated by better Qx or 5x hands. From early position, we need a much stronger range.\n\n**Position:**\nUTG is the worst position. If I call or raise, I'll have 4 players acting after me who could have much stronger hands.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall, I see:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been folding a lot preflop\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) made a raise in hand 19\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) made a raise in hand 22\n- Generally tight play from opponents\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWith 59.2 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots, especially from UTG. Preserving chips is important.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. Q5s is too weak to play from UTG, even with the suited aspect. I could be dominated by so many hands (AQ, KQ, QJ, QT, any pocket pair, etc.). The potential upside of hitting a flush or two pair doesn't justify the risk from this position.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** 8s 6d\n**Board:** 5d 5h 3h\n**Position:** BTN (Button)\n**Stack:** 233 chips (58.2 BB)\n**Pot:** 8 chips\n**Opponent:** GPT-OSS-120B in SB position, checked to me\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have 8-high with no pair, no draw\n- The board is paired (5-5-3) with two hearts\n- I have absolutely nothing - just 8-high\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at the recall data for GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5):\n- Very tight player, folds preflop frequently\n- When they do play, they tend to check-fold on the flop\n- In hand 23, they called preflop then check-folded on flop\n- In hand 18, they checked then folded on flop\n- In hand 12, they raised preflop, called a raise, then check-folded flop\n- Only showdown shows they had 2s 5s (made trips on that board)\n\nThis opponent is clearly very tight and passive. The fact they checked on this flop suggests weakness.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the button, which is great position. I have the advantage of acting last.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 8 chips, I can check for free. If I bet, minimum raise is 4 chips.\n\n**Decision:** I have absolutely no hand (8-high). However, I have position and my opponent has shown a pattern of being very tight and giving up on flops. This is a good spot for a continuation bet/bluff since:\n1. I checked preflop as BB, opponent just called as SB\n2. The flop is paired (5-5-3) which is scary and hard to hit\n3. Opponent checked to me showing weakness\n4. I have position\n5. Opponent's history shows they frequently fold to flop bets\n\nHowever, I need to consider that my hand is COMPLETE air. I have no equity, no draw, nothing. While a bluff might work, I'm risking chips with zero chance of winning if called.\n\nGiven that it's a tournament and I have a healthy stack (58 BB), but also considering my opponent's tight nature, I think a small bluff could be profitable. But checking is also fine - I have no hand and can give up.\n\nLet me think about sizing. Minimum raise is 4 chips (to 4 total). A standard c-bet would be about 50-75% of pot, so 4-6 chips. Since the pot is 8, a bet of 4-6 chips makes sense.\n\nActually, wait - the minimum raise to is 4, which means I can raise TO 4 chips total (so bet 4 chips). That's a half-pot bet, which is reasonable.\n\nGiven my opponent's tight pattern and the fact that this board is hard to hit, I think a small bluff is profitable here. But I should keep it small since I have no equity.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have 8-high complete air. While my opponent is tight, bluffing with absolutely nothing is risky. Checking and giving up is also a reasonable play. The fact that they just called preflop from SB and checked flop suggests they might have some piece of this board or are trapping. \n\nBut their pattern is very convincing - they check-fold flops a lot. I think a small stab is worth it. I'll bet the minimum (4 chips) as a bluff.\n\nWait, let me think one more time. I have:\n- 8-high, no draw\n- Position\n- Tight opponent who check-folds a lot\n- Paired board that's scary\n\nThe conservative play is to check and give up. The aggressive play is to bet small as a bluff.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and that I have a healthy stack, I think taking a small +EV bluff is fine. But actually, with absolutely zero equity, I might just want to check and preserve chips.\n\nYou know what, I think checking is the better play here. I have literally nothing, and while the opponent is tight, bluffing with 8-high is just burning chips in many cases. Let me check and see what happens on the turn. If they check again, I might consider bluffing then.\n\nActually, the board is paired which is good for bluffing, and my opponent's stats are very compelling. Let me make a small stab. I'll bet 4 chips.\n\nNo wait - I should be more conservative. With 8-high and no draw, I should just check. I can bluff later if the opponent shows more weakness. Checking is free and preserves my equity.\n\nFinal decision: Check.",

There's no reason to bet as a bluff because:\n- The opponent likely has a weak hand but might call a small bet\n- I don't need to protect my hand (I have a draw, not a made hand)\n- I want to see the river card for free if possible\n- If I hit my straight on the river, I can potentially extract value from this passive opponent\n\nThe best play is to check and see a free river card.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have an open-ended straight draw with 8 outs.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand:** 8s 6d (8 of spades, 6 of diamonds)\n**Board:** 5d 5h 3h 7s 4h\n\nLet me check if I have a straight:\n- My cards: 8, 6\n- Board: 5, 5, 3, 7, 4\n- Sorted: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\nWait, I have 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 on the board! That's a straight! The board shows 5d 5h 3h 7s 4h, which means I have 3-4-5-6-7. That's a straight on the board.\n\nActually, let me recount:\n- My cards: 8s, 6d\n- Board: 5d, 5h, 3h, 7s, 4h\n\nSo I have: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\nThe board itself contains: 3, 4, 5, 5, 7\n\nSo the board has 3-4-5-7, and I have 6-8. This gives me:\n- 3-4-5-6-7 = a straight!\n\nThe board is paired (two 5s), but I have a straight from 3 to 7. I beat anyone who doesn't have a better straight or a full house/quads.\n\nWhat could beat me?\n- 6-8-9-T-J (impossible, board doesn't have 9,T,J)\n- Any straight higher than mine (8-high straight) would require 4-5-6-7-8, 5-6-7-8-9, etc.\n- The highest possible straight with this board would be 4-5-6-7-8 (if someone has 8)\n- Or 5-6-7-8-9 (impossible, no 9)\n- Full house or quads (if someone has a 5, they have trips, but board paired means quads or full house possible)\n\nActually, wait. Let me re-evaluate the board: 5d 5h 3h 7s 4h\nBoard cards: 3, 4, 5, 5, 7\n\nMy hand: 8s 6d (6, 8)\n\nSo my best 5-card hand would be: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 = Straight (7-high)\n\n\nI notice a potential vulnerability in my hand. If an opponent holds 8, they could make an 8-high straight with 4-5-6-7-8. This means my current straight might be at risk. The board's paired 5s add another layer of complexity, potentially allowing for full house or quad combinations. I need to carefully consider the betting action and potential hand ranges of my opponents.\n\nThe betting pattern seems suspicious. A small 8-chip bet into a 16-chip pot suggests either a weak hand or a potential trap. I'm getting 3-to-1 pot odds, which makes calling mathematically attractive. However, the potential for being outdrawn keeps me cautious.\n\nMy stack of 233 chips gives me flexibility, but I must stay alert to potential stronger hands. The straight looks solid, but poker always has surprises lurking beneath the surface.\n\nI need to carefully consider the potential hand ranges. With a paired board and possible straight draws, my opponent might be holding something tricky. The small bet could indicate weakness or a subtle trap. I'll need to weigh the pot odds against the risk of being outdrawn.\n\nMy stack size provides some strategic room, but I'll want to minimize potential losses if my opponent has a superior hand. A defensive play seems most prudent right now.\n\nThe pot odds are attractive at 3:1, and my straight looks reasonably strong. However, the paired board and potential higher straight combinations make me cautious. I'll call and see the showdown, keeping my risk relatively low while maintaining the potential to win a decent pot.\n\nMy opponent's betting pattern suggests possible weakness or a marginal hand. The small bet size might indicate they're testing the waters or trying to extract thin value. I'll match their bet and observe their reaction, which could reveal more about their hand strength.\n\nWith pot odds of 3:1 and a made straight, calling seems like the most prudent move. I want to see a cheap showdown without unnecessarily inflating the pot, especially given the potential for a stronger hand on the paired board.",

The preflop raise to 12 was likely a strong hand (maybe 88+, AJ+).\n\n**Position & Stack considerations:**\n- I have 237 chips (59 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot is 28 chips\n- I can check and see a free card with my overcards\n\n**Decision:**\nChecking is the clear best option here because:\n1. I have no made hand, just overcards\n2. The board is relatively dry (no flush/straight draws for me)\n3. My opponent showed strength preflop\n4. I have position (I act after them on future streets)\n5. Getting a free card to hit my K or J is valuable\n6. No need to build a pot with a weak hand\n\nI should definitely not raise here - that would be a pure bluff on a board that likely hit my opponent's raising range.\n\nI'll check and see what happens on the turn.",

The board is Ts 7h 3c. I have:\n- No pair\n- No flush draw (one club)\n- No straight draw (need Q and 9, or A and Q - not possible)\n- Two overcards to the board (K and J)\n\n**Opponent info:**\n- GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively passive based on the recall data\n- They've folded preflop several times\n- When they do play, they tend to check-fold on flops\n- In hand 24, they did bet 8 on the river after checking flop and turn\n- They raised preflop to 12 in this hand, which is a strong action from them\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 40 chips, need to call 12\n- Getting 40:12 or about 3.33:1 odds\n- Need ~23% equity to break even on a call\n\n**Equity consideration:**\nWith KJ on T-7-3 rainbow board:\n- Against a pair of Tens: ~24% equity (6 outs - 3 Kings + 3 Jacks)\n- Against a pair of 7s or 3s: ~24% equity\n- Against two pair: ~13% equity\n- Against a set: ~7% equity\n- Against AK/AQ: ~28% equity (if they missed)\n\nThe roughly 24% equity against most made hands is close to the required 23% break-even point. However, this assumes we get to see both turn and river, which we might not if opponent bets again.\n\n**Position and future streets:**\n- I'm out of position, which is bad\n- If I call and miss the turn, I'll face another bet\n- Opponent has 140 chips left (35 BB), so they can apply pressure\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (59 BB)\n- Don't need to take marginal spots\n- Better spots will come\n\n**Opponent's range:**\nThey raised preflop from Seat 5, which is a middle position. They could have:\n- Pocket pairs (TT+ would be strong, but 22-99 also possible)\n- Broadways (AT+, KJ+, QJ+)\n- Some suited connectors\n\nGiven the board Ts 7h 3c and their flop bet of 12 into 40 (30% pot), they likely have:\n- A pair (T with good kicker, 77, 33)\n- Overpair (JJ+)\n- Possibly just continuation betting with air\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a marginal spot. I have 6 clean outs (3 Kings, 3 Jacks). The pot odds are barely sufficient, but:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. I have to dodge turn bets if I miss\n3. Opponent's preflop raise suggests strength\n4. I have a healthy stack and can wait for better spots\n\nI think folding is the best play here. The combination of being out of position, having a marginal hand with limited equity, and opponent showing strength preflop makes this a fold. I can preserve my chips for better spots where I have initiative or better equity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Good, I have some information about the opponents:\n\n**Kimi-K2 (SB, Seat 2):**\n- Very tight player - mostly folding preflop (folded in 8 of last 10 hands)\n- Only raised once (hand #22) and checked once when they could\n- Not very aggressive\n\n**DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB, Seat 3):**\n- Also tight but slightly more active than SB\n- Folded 6 of last 10 hands preflop\n- Raised once (hand #23) and followed up with a flop bet\n- From hand #21, I can see they defended BB with As2d (a weak ace) and checked it down\n- Seems to play straightforward\n\n**My situation:**\n- Position: BTN (best position)\n- Cards: Ah Th (ace-ten suited) - This is a strong hand on the button\n- Stack: 237 chips (59.2 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot: 6 chips (1.5 BB)\n- Need to call 4 chips to see flop\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Ah Th is a very good hand, especially on the button. It's suited, has an ace, and good straight potential.\n2. **Position**: BTN is the best position - I act last on every street.\n3. **Opponents**: Both blinds are tight players who fold a lot. The SB folds ~80% of the time, BB folds ~60% of the time.\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 59 BB, I have a comfortable stack. I should be looking to accumulate chips against tight opponents.\n\nGiven that both opponents are tight and I'm on the button with a strong suited ace, I should raise here. A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 12 chips, but since there's already a SB posted, I should raise to about 3-3.5x total.\n\nMinimum raise is 8, but that's too small. I want to:\n1. Get value from my strong hand\n2. Apply pressure to tight opponents\n3. Build the pot when I have position and a good hand\n\nA raise to 12-16 chips seems appropriate. I'll go with 12 chips (3x BB) as a standard sizing that should be enough to pressure the tight blinds but not too large to risk too many chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With both players being tight, I could raise a bit larger to really put pressure on them. A raise to 14-16 chips would be good. I'll go with 14 chips to keep it reasonable but apply maximum pressure.\n\nWait, looking at the pattern again - both opponents fold a lot to raises. The BB did raise once and then bet the flop, showing they can be aggressive with strong hands. But overall, they're tight.\n\nWith Ah Th on the button, this is definitely a raising hand. I'll raise to 14 chips to:\n1. Build the pot with my strong hand\n2. Apply pressure to tight opponents\n3. Take control of the hand with position\n4. Potentially win the pot preflop (which is fine too)\n\n14 chips is about 3.5x BB, which is a solid standard raise size.",

Seems to play very selectively.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Mixed player. Has shown aggression with raises, but also folds frequently. They posted SB this hand.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Very tight player. Folded 9 out of 10 times preflop. Only called once then folded.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:** 56o from UTG is a very weak hand. I should almost always fold this from early position. \n- No pair, no high cards\n- Not suited\n- Low connectors that rarely make strong hands\n- From UTG, I have 7 players left to act behind me\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** \n- I have a healthy stack (60.8 BB)\n- No need to take risks with marginal hands\n- Early position requires premium hands\n- The players behind me include tight players who will likely fold unless they have strong hands, but I can't rely on that\n\n**Pot odds:** Need to call 4 chips to win 6 chips = 1.5:1. This is not enough to justify playing this weak hand.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an easy fold. 56o from UTG is not a playable hand, especially with a healthy stack. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

This is a clear fold in almost all situations.\n\n2. **Position:** UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act on all postflop streets with 4 players still to act behind me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** The table seems relatively tight based on the folding patterns, but Seat 5 has shown aggression. This makes playing a weak hand even more dangerous.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations:** With 60+ BB, I have a healthy stack. No need to risk chips with such a weak hand from bad position. Preserving my stack for better spots is key.\n\n5. **Pot odds:** 4 chips to win 6 chips = 1.5:1 pot odds, which is not nearly enough to justify playing this hand.\n\n**Decision:** Clear fold.

However, with 7c 3c, position doesn't help much with such a weak hand.\n\n**Stack**: 243 chips (60.8 BB) - Healthy stack, no need to take risks.\n\n**Current Action**:\n- SB posted 2\n- BB posted 4\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called 8\n\n**Pot**: 22 chips\n**To call**: 8 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis**:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has folded preflop in the last 10 hands consecutively! This is a very tight player. The fact that they're raising now suggests they have a strong hand.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): More active. They raised in hand 25 and 30, and showed down 8d 7s in hand 30. They seem to be a looser, more aggressive player.\n\n**Pot Odds**: 8 to win 22 = 2.75:1, which is about 36.4% equity needed to call. Even with position, 7c 3c has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. \n- My hand is extremely weak (7-3 offsuit)\n- There's been a raise from a very tight player (Seat 4 who has folded 10 straight hands)\n- There's also a caller (Seat 5)\n- I'm risking 8 chips (3.3% of my stack) with a hand that will rarely hit and is difficult to play postflop\n- Even on the button, this hand is not worth playing in a raised pot\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

That's 12/(18+12) = 12/30 = 40% equity needed.\n\n**Hand equity**: 9s 3d has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a very wide range, this hand is a clear fold.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 60 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nEven though the opponent might be raising wide, 9s 3d is just too weak to call. I should fold.\n\nLet me think about raising as a bluff: \n- I could raise to 20 (minimum)\n- But I'm out of position relative to the button and blinds\n- My hand has no playability postflop\n- It's not worth the risk with a marginal bluffing hand\n\nDecision: **Fold**",

K4s is not a playable hand from UTG position, even with the suited connector potential. The risk of being dominated, the poor position, and the availability of better spots all point to folding.\n\nI don't need to search for more specific opponent information - the hand is weak enough that it's a clear fold regardless of opponent tendencies.",

The combination of poor card quality, tight opponent, and unfavorable pot odds makes this an easy decision.

They limped once and folded on flop. They seem straightforward and not overly aggressive postflop.\n\n**Hand strength**: K8o is a marginal hand, especially from SB. It's dominated by many hands (any K with better kicker, any pair). \n\n**Position**: SB is terrible postflop - I'll be first to act on every street.\n\n**Pot odds**: I'm getting 5:1 to call (call 2 to win 10), which is attractive, but I need to consider reverse implied odds - when I hit my King, I could lose a lot if opponent has a better kicker.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 59 BB, I have a comfortable stack. I don't need to take marginal spots. The opponent seems straightforward and likely has a hand they're willing to play given they called from CO.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. K8o is too weak from SB, especially with position disadvantage and risk of being dominated. Even with good pot odds, the reverse implied odds and postflop playability make this a losing play long-term.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with pocket 4s (44)\n- Stack: 237 chips (59.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- To call: 4 chips\n- Legal: fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponent tendencies from recall:**\n- Seat 2 (SB - Kimi-K2): Very tight/passive. Has folded preflop many times, only checked in one hand (hand 30) and folded on flop. Showed down Ts6s in hand 30 which is a weak hand. Seems to play very few hands.\n- Seat 3 (BB - DeepSeek-V3.2): Also tight but occasionally raises. Has folded many times preflop but raised to 12 in hand 28 and 14 in hand 34. Showed down As2d in hand 21.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- Pocket 4s is a decent but not strong hand\n- On the button, this is a good position to see a flop\n- I'm getting good odds to call (4 to win 6, or 1.5:1)\n- If I raise, I might fold out the SB who is very tight\n- The BB has shown they can raise, so there's some risk\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- I'm relatively deep stacked at 59 BB\n- The SB is very tight and likely to fold to pressure\n- The BB is also tight but capable of raising\n- Pocket pairs like 4s want to see cheap flops to hit sets\n- Raising might isolate me against stronger hands\n- Calling gives me good implied odds if I hit a set\n\n**Decision:** I should call. Pocket 4s plays well in position on the button. The call is cheap (4 chips), and I have good implied odds if I hit my set. Both opponents seem tight, so I'm unlikely to face aggression unless they have strong hands. Raising would be overplaying this hand and could fold out worse hands while getting called/raised by better ones.\n\nLet me make the call.",

Check - Take a free card, hope to hit a 4 (2 outs, ~4.5% chance)\n2. Bet - Try to steal the pot, but risk getting called/raised by better hands\n3. Fold - Not an option since I can check for free\n\n**Analysis:**\n- My hand is very weak against this board\n- I have only 2 outs (the remaining two 4s) to improve\n- The Ace on board is scary and likely hits my opponent's range\n- My opponent is tight and checked, which suggests some weakness but could also be a trap\n- Checking is free and lets me see the turn card\n- If I bet, I might steal the pot sometimes, but risk being called by any Ace, Jack, or better pair\n- Given my opponent's tight nature, they likely have some piece of this board or would have folded preflop\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check here. The risk/reward of betting isn't good:\n- I have very little equity (only 2 outs)\n- The board is scary with an Ace\n- My opponent is tight and could easily have an Ace\n- I can check for free and see the turn card\n- If I hit a 4 on the turn, I might have a well-disguised set\n\nChecking preserves my stack and gives me a free chance to hit my 2-outer. Betting would be a bluff with very little fold equity against a tight player on an Ace-high board.",

I can check or raise.\n\n**Hand analysis**: I have pocket fours on a board with J-A-8-9. This is a very wet board with straight draws (Q-T, T-7) and potential flush draws (diamonds). My fours are very weak here. I have no pair (the board has overcards), no draw, and only two outs to improve to a set on the river.\n\n**Opponent analysis**: DeepSeek-V3.2 has been quite tight based on their recent actions. Looking at the data:\n- They've folded preflop many times (hands 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 35)\n- They've raised preflop a few times (hands 23, 28, 34)\n- In hand 21, they checked down all streets\n- In hand 23, they raised preflop and bet on the flop\n\nThis suggests they're a relatively tight player who doesn't get to showdown often and tends to fold when they don't have strong hands.\n\n**Action**: The opponent has checked to me on the turn. This could mean:\n1. They have a weak hand and want to see a free river\n2. They have a marginal hand and are pot-controlling\n3. They have a strong hand and are trying to trap\n\nGiven the wet board (J-A-8-9 with two diamonds), if they had a strong hand like top pair, two pair, or a straight, they would likely be betting for value and protection.\n\n**My decision**: I have absolutely nothing with my pocket fours. \n\nI see two potential paths forward. Checking allows me to see the river without risking additional chips, which seems prudent given my weak hand. The pot is currently small, and I have no compelling reason to inflate it with such a marginal holding. \n\nA bluff could potentially work against this tight opponent, but the risk seems unnecessary. I'll conserve my chips and check through to the river, hoping for a miracle four to improve my hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The hand has reached the river with a board of Jd As 8h 9d 5h. I have pocket 4s (4s 4h), which is a weak hand on this board. Let me analyze:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have pocket 4s. The board shows Jd As 8h 9d 5h. I have no pair, no draw, and no real hand. My best hand is Ace-high, but that's not strong given the action.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position, but that doesn't matter much when I have no hand.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: The pot is 10 chips and I can check for free. There would need to be a very compelling reason to bet here.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's actions, they've been very passive - lots of folding and checking. They've only raised a few times preflop (hands 23, 28, 34) but then didn't show much aggression postflop. In hand 23, they raised preflop to 8 and bet 8 on the flop, but in hand 34 they raised to 14 preflop. They seem to be playing a tight, passive style.\n\n5. **The action**: Everyone checked on every street. This suggests weakness from all players. DeepSeek-V3.2 checked the river, giving me the option to check or bet.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 233 chips (58.2 BB), I have a healthy stack. Betting here would be a pure bluff. Given that everyone has shown weakness by checking through, a small bluff might work, but it's risky with no equity.\n\n7. **Bluffing opportunity**: Since everyone has checked through, I could represent a strong hand with a small bet. However, DeepSeek-V3.2 has shown they can call or raise preflop with decent hands. The board is somewhat connected (J-8-9-5 with an Ace) which could hit many hands.\n\nGiven that I have absolutely no hand (just 44 on a board with an Ace, Jack, 9, 8, 5), and all the checking suggests weakness, I have two options:\n\n\nI'll take the conservative approach and check. With no hand and multiple opponents showing weakness, checking minimizes risk. While a bluff might seem tempting, the lack of any real hand strength makes it too dangerous. Checking allows me to see the showdown without investing more chips, which is the most prudent move in this tournament situation.",

Q7o is a fold in early position in almost all situations.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table, I have to act first on every street. I need a very strong hand to play from here.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 243 chips (60.8 BB) - I have a healthy stack, no need to take risks.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: Looking at my hand history, I have a 24.3% win rate with 27 folds and only 9 wins out of 37 hands. This suggests I've been playing tight, which is appropriate.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: From the search results, I can see:\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 has made preflop raises (hands 23, 28, 34)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has made preflop raises (hands 25, 30, 32)\n   - MiniMax-M2 has made preflop raises (hands 31)\n   - My clone (Kimi-K2) has also made raises (hands 27)\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 6, which is 1.5:1. Even with these odds, Q7o is too weak from UTG.\n\n7. **My recent hands**: I've been folding a lot, especially from early position (hands 28, 33, 37 were all folds from early/mid positions). This is disciplined play.\n\nWith Q7 offsuit from UTG, this is a clear fold. The hand has poor equity, I'm out of position, and I have no reason to risk chips with such a marginal holding. Even if the table is playing tight, I should wait for a better spot.\n\nThe correct play is to fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have K\u2660 Q\u2660 in the BB - a very strong suited broadway hand\n- I'm out of position against one opponent (MiniMax-M2) who just called the BB\n- Pot is 10 chips (4 from me, 4 from MiniMax, 2 from SB)\n- I can check or raise\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nMiniMax-M2 has been very tight recently:\n- Hands 35-38: Folded preflop every time\n- Hand 33: Called 2 chips (minimum), then bet 6 on flop\n- Hand 32: Folded preflop\n- Hand 31: Raised to 8 preflop, then bet 14 on flop\n\nSo when they do enter a pot, they can be aggressive. The call from the CO (seat 4) suggests a medium strength hand - maybe suited connectors, small pairs, or broadway cards. They didn't raise, which is good for me.\n\n**Position and Stack:**\n- I'm out of position (BB) with 239 chips (59.8 BB)\n- MiniMax has 182 chips (45.5 BB)\n- We're relatively deep stacked\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nKQs is a premium hand, especially suited. It plays very well postflop with potential for:\n- Top pair good kicker\n- Flush draws\n- Straight draws\n- Nut flushes\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear check situation. Here's why:\n1. I'm out of position - checking keeps the pot small and allows me to see the flop cheaply\n2. KQs plays very well postflop - I want to see a flop with this hand\n3. MiniMax is tight and called rather than raised - they likely have a decent but not premium hand\n4. No need to bloat the pot preflop out of position\n5. If I raise, I might fold out weaker hands and only get action from hands that dominate me (AA, KK, QQ, AK)\n\nThe EV is higher by checking and seeing a flop with my suited connectors.",

KJo from SB against a tight raiser and a caller is a marginal spot at best. The raiser's tight pattern suggests real strength, and I'll be out of position postflop. With a healthy stack of 61.8 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots like this. \n\nI could consider a squeeze raise, but that would commit too many chips with a hand that plays poorly postflop when called. The risk/reward isn't favorable here.\n\n**Decision**: Fold",

T3s from UTG is a trash hand that should never be played in this position. The risk of running into a much better hand is extremely high, and even if we hit a flush or straight, we won't often get paid off enough to justify the preflop investment.\n\nThe math is simple: we have to put in 8 chips to win 12 (1.5:1 pot odds), but our hand equity is likely less than 20% against any reasonable range of hands that would call or raise us.",

It's offsuit and the cards aren't coordinated well enough to make strong draws or straights.

I don't need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands from bad position. Tournament survival and chip preservation are important.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n8\u2666 7\u2665 from UTG is a clear fold.

K9o is marginal, especially OOP\n2. MiniMax-M2 is tight - calling 1 BB suggests some strength\n3. I'm out of position - will be difficult to play postflop\n4. I have a decent stack and don't need to take marginal spots\n5. No dead money to fight for (only 1 caller)\n\nI should check and see a flop. Raising would be spewy with this hand against a tight opponent. Folding is too tight since I'm getting a free flop.\n\nLet me check.",

The board has a pair of 4s, so I have two pair (9s and 4s) with a King kicker. This is a strong hand, though the board is paired which can be concerning.\n\n**Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 is in Seat 4 with 180 chips (22.5 BB). Let me analyze their tendencies:\n- They have been folding a lot preflop (many folds, some calls and occasional raises)\n- When they do play, they tend to bet on the flop (hands 31, 33, 40)\n- They seem to be a fairly tight player who bets when they have something\n\n**Current action**: It's checked to me on the flop. I can check or bet.\n\n**My options**:\n1. Check - Let them potentially bet with a weaker hand, or see a free card\n2. Bet - Protect my hand, get value from draws or weaker pairs\n\nGiven that I have two pair (9s and 4s), this is a strong hand on this board. However, there are some concerns:\n- The board is paired, which means someone could have a 4 (trip 4s) or a full house\n- There are potential straight draws (3-5, 5-6, etc.) and flush draws (two diamonds on board)\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2's tendency to bet on the flop when they play, I should consider:\n- If I check, they might bet with weaker hands like pocket pairs, draws, or even air\n- If I bet, I can protect my hand and get value from weaker hands\n\nWith my stack size (29.9 BB), I have room to play. The pot is 20 chips. A standard bet would be around 50-70% of pot, so 10-14 chips.\n\nI think betting is the better option here. I have a strong hand and should:\n1. Protect against draws\n\n\n2. Extract value from weaker hands that might call\n3. Take control of the hand\n\nA strategic 12-chip bet (60% of pot) could effectively pressure opponents. This bet size communicates strength while keeping my options open. It might induce folds from marginal hands and potentially extract value from those holding weaker pairs or drawing hands. The bet protects my two-pair hand and maintains my aggressive posture in the tournament.",

The raises of 24 chips (3 BB) in hands 41 and 42 suggest they're playing solid hands.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n5d 2h is one of the worst starting hands in poker. It has almost no potential to make strong hands. The only real value would be if it hits a straight (very unlikely) or we bluff successfully.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm on the button, which is great, but even position can't overcome such a terrible hand.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nI need to call 4 chips to win 12 chips = 3:1 pot odds. This is technically sufficient for any hand, but with 5-2 offsuit, even these odds aren't attractive.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 31.9 BB\n- This is a tournament, so preserving chips is important\n- I could try a steal raise from the button since everyone folded, but:\n  - The BB has shown they defend with raises\n  - My hand is too weak to continue if called or raised\n  - Risking 16 chips (2 BB) to steal 12 chips isn't a great risk/reward\n  - The BB has 27 BB, so they can easily defend\n\n**Decision:**\nThe best play is to fold. 5-2 offsuit is simply too weak to play, even from the button. The opponent in the BB has shown they defend their blind and can raise. Calling would be throwing away 4 chips with a hand that will almost never win. Raising as a steal is too risky with this hand strength and opponent tendencies.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

I act last postflop.\n\n**Stack sizes**: I have 31.9 BB, which is comfortable. Both opponents have similar or smaller stacks.\n\n**Pot odds**: 8 to win 12 = 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed to call. KTo is definitely worth that.\n\n**Decision**:\nGiven that:\n1. I'm on the button with position\n2. KTo is a decent hand, especially for stealing\n3. The BB (Seat 3) has folded 9 hands in a row preflop - extremely tight\n4. The SB (Seat 2) has been somewhat active but also folds frequently\n5. I have a healthy stack\n\nThis is a clear raise situation. I should try to steal the blinds. A standard raise would be 3x the big blind, so 24 chips. Since the minimum raise is 16, I can raise to 24.\n\nGiven the BB's extreme tightness (folding 9 straight hands), there's a very high chance they fold to a raise. The SB has shown they can fold as well.\n\nI should raise to 24 chips to:\n1. Try to steal the blinds\n2. Build the pot if called with my decent hand\n3. Maintain pressure with position\n\nIf I get called, I have position and a hand that can hit top pair with a good kicker.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"On the button with KTo, facing a very tight BB who has folded 9 straight hands preflop.

I have:\n\n- 46 total hands played\n- 33 folds (71.7% fold rate)\n- 12 wins (26% win rate when I play)\n- Only 1 win from UTG position (Qc 7s folded)\n\nMy current hand is Qc 5c from UTG position. Let me analyze:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Qc 5c is a weak hand. It's suited, which gives some potential for a flush, but the kicker (5) is very low. This is not a strong starting hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in UTG (Under the Gun), which is the worst position preflop. I have 7 players behind me who could all have stronger hands.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 267 chips, which is 33.4 BB. This is a decent stack, but I should be careful not to bleed chips with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With blinds at 4/8, the tournament is getting more expensive. I need to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n5. **My recent play**: Looking at my last 10 hands, I've been folding most hands. I did win hand #46 with Kd Th on the button by raising to 24. But from UTG, I should be much tighter.\n\nFrom UTG position, standard poker strategy suggests playing only premium hands (AA, KK, QQ, AK, AQ, AJ suited, KQ suited, etc.). Q5 suited is definitely not in this range.\n\nEven though it's suited, the low kicker makes this hand very vulnerable. If I hit a Q on the flop, I'll often be dominated by hands like AQ, KQ, QJ. If I hit a flush, it will be a low flush that could be beaten by higher flushes.\n\nThe call is 8 chips, which is about 3% of my stack. While this isn't a huge investment, it's still chips I should preserve for better opportunities.\n\nGiven my tight image and the fact that I'm in early position with a weak hand, I should fold.",

They raised to 16 (2x the BB) which is a small raise. Given their tight nature, they're likely doing this with a wide range since everyone folded to them.\n\n**My hand**: T8s is actually a decent defending hand against a steal. I have position and a suited connector that can flop well.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, so 3:1 pot odds. This is good enough to call with a speculative hand.\n\n**Stack considerations**: Calling 8 chips is only 3% of my stack, so very low risk. If I raise, I'd be raising to at least 24 which is about 9% of my stack.\n\n**Decision**: I should call. I have position, decent pot odds, and a hand that can flop well.

The board is 2h Jc Tc.\n- I have a pair of tens (second pair)\n- There's a flush draw on board (2 clubs)\n- There's a straight draw possibility (Q-9, K-Q)\n- My kicker is weak (8)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw with the Td\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's actions:\n- They frequently fold preflop (hands 34, 36, 37, 39, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48)\n- When they do play, they often fold on the flop (hands 31, 33, 40)\n- They occasionally bet on flop (hand 35: bet 12 after calling preflop)\n- They raised preflop in hand 32\n- They called preflop in hands 35, 40, 41\n\nPattern: This opponent is relatively tight/passive. They fold a lot, especially postflop. When they check on the flop, they might be weak or giving up.\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check: Take a free card, see if I improve. Risk giving free card to opponent.\n2. Bet: Protect my hand, get value from worse hands, charge draws.\n\n**Considerations:**\n- I have a decent made hand (middle pair)\n- The board is somewhat coordinated (flush draw, straight possibilities)\n- My opponent checked, showing weakness\n- I have position (on the button)\n- Pot is 32 chips\n- Opponent has 100 chips behind (started with 116, put in 16 preflop)\n\nI think a bet here is good. I can:\n1. Protect against draws\n2. Get value from weaker hands\n3. Take down the pot now\n4. Build the pot if I'm ahead\n\nSizing: The pot is 32. A bet of 16-24 (50-75% pot) seems reasonable. Since the minimum raise is 8, and that's too small, I should bet more. Let me bet around 20-24.\n\nGiven the coordinated board and my vulnerable hand, I should bet for protection and value. I'll bet 24 (75% of pot) to charge draws and get value from weaker pairs.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The minimum raise is 8, which means I can bet as little as 8, but that's too small. I want to bet an amount that makes sense. Let me bet 20, which is about 62.5% of pot. This is a good size for protection.\n\nLooking at the legal actions again: \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this means the minimum TOTAL bet is 8, but I should bet more. Let me go with 20.",

In hand 50, they raised to 60 then to 164, showing they can make big raises. They showed down Ts6s (weak hand) and ThTs (pocket tens).\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Very tight! Has folded preflop almost every hand. Only raised once in hand 48. They showed down As2d and 2d2c, suggesting they play very tight ranges.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: T8 offsuit is a marginal hand. It's not strong, but it has some playability, especially in position.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position. I'll act last post-flop.\n3. **Opponents**: SB seems moderately active, BB is extremely tight.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 12 (1.5:1), which is 40% equity needed. T8o doesn't have that against typical raising ranges, but...\n5. **Implied odds**: With position and the tight BB, I might get folds post-flop or extract value when I hit.\n6. **Stack sizes**: Both opponents have decent stacks. No immediate pressure.\n\n**Decision**: This is a close spot. T8o is marginal but being on the button against what appears to be a tight BB makes this a borderline call. The SB hasn't raised yet (just posted), so I only need to worry about the BB. \n\nGiven the BB folds very frequently (8/10 times in the sample), calling here to see a flop in position seems reasonable. If I hit a strong hand, I can extract value. If I miss, I can fold easily.\n\nHowever, I could also raise to try to take down the pot preflop. A min-raise to 16 would risk 16 to win 12. Given the BB folds 80% of the time, this could be profitable.\n\nLet me think about the best approach:\n- **Call**: Lower risk, see flop, play post-flop poker with position\n- **Raise**: Higher risk/reward, capitalize on BB's tightness\n\nGiven that T8o is not a strong raising hand, and I have position, I think calling is the better play. I want to keep the pot small with a marginal hand and use my position advantage post-flop. The BB's tightness means I might get a free card or face small bets I can call/fold to appropriately.",

My hand is extremely weak - I have nothing\n2. I'm in position which is good for bluffing, but...\n3. The board has a King which hits many calling ranges\n4. Both opponents checked, showing weakness but they could be trapping or have marginal hands\n5. With my healthy stack, I don't need to make desperate moves\n6. Checking is free and I can see a free card\n7. If I raise as a bluff, I risk chips with very little equity\n\n**Should I bluff?**\n- The board is somewhat coordinated with the Kh and potential straight draws\n- Both players showed weakness by checking\n- However, my hand has zero showdown value and limited potential\n- A bluff might work sometimes, but it's risky\n- With my stack size, I should be more selective\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a clear check situation. I have a very weak hand with no real potential, and there's no value in betting as a bluff here given the board texture and that I can see a free card. I should check and hope to improve on the turn, or fold if there's significant action.",

They have a King and now have trips or full house\n2. They had a flush draw that missed and are bluffing\n3. They had a straight that got counterfeited by the board pairing\n4. They have a weak hand and are trying to get me to fold\n\nGiven my hand is essentially trip Kings with a 10 kicker, I should consider:\n- If they have a King, their kicker could be better than mine\n\n\n- If they have a flush, I'm beaten\n- If they have a full house (Kx or 99), I'm beaten\n- If they're bluffing, I win\n\nI'll carefully weigh the pot odds and my potential hand strength against their possible holdings. The small river bet suggests they might be trying to extract value or block a potential flush. With my trip Kings and decent kicker, calling seems like a reasonable play.\n\nThe low pot-sized bet indicates they could be testing the waters with a marginal hand. I'll need to consider the potential range of hands they might be representing and whether my current holding can withstand a potential raise.\n\nGiven the paired board and my current trips, I suspect I'm likely ahead, but I'll stay cautious about potential full house combinations or a hidden King that could outkick my 10.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Perfect! I have pocket aces (Ad Ah) from UTG position. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Strength**: I have the best starting hand in poker - pocket aces. This is a premium hand that I definitely want to play aggressively.\n\n**Position**: I'm UTG (Under the Gun), which is the worst position. However, with aces, position matters less because I want to build a pot with a strong hand.\n\n**Stack Size**: I have 231 chips (28.9 BB), which is a decent stack. Not too deep, not too short.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**:\n- **Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**: Has been folding a lot preflop but made a big raise to 60 and then 164 in hand #50. They showed down pocket tens, so they can make big raises with strong hands. They seem to be a tighter player who makes big moves with strong holdings.\n\n- **Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**: Has been folding a lot but made a raise to 20 in hand #48. They showed down A2, 22, and K5 suited in previous hands. They seem to be a bit looser and more passive.\n\n- **Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)**: Very tight player. Mostly folding preflop, occasionally calling (called 8 chips twice). They seem passive and only play when they have something decent.\n\n**Strategy**: With pocket aces from UTG, I want to:\n1. Build the pot since I have a huge equity advantage\n2. Protect against multiple callers who could crack my aces\n3. Extract value from strong hands\n\nGiven that I'm in early position, I should make a substantial raise. With blinds at 4/8, a standard raise would be 3-4x the big blind, but since I'm UTG with a premium hand, I should raise more to:\n- Thin the field\n- Build the pot\n- Get value from strong hands\n\nI have 231 chips, so I can afford a decent raise. A raise to about 24-32 chips (3-4x BB) would be standard, but given my position and the need to protect against multiple callers, I might want to go a bit larger.\n\nLet me raise to 32 chips (4x BB). This is a solid raise that:\n- Shows strength\n- Builds the pot\n- Should get folds from weak hands\n- Can get called by strong hands that I'll have dominated\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise amount shown is 16, which is 2x BB. But with pocket aces from UTG, I should raise larger. Let me go with 32 chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- I have Ad Ah (pocket aces) on the button\n- Flop: Jd 9d 6s (two diamonds, no straight draw yet)\n- Pot: 92 chips\n- I need to call 24 chips\n- Minimum raise to 48 chips\n- My stack: 199 chips (24.9 BB)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have an overpair (pocket aces) on a somewhat coordinated board with two diamonds\n- This is a strong hand but vulnerable to:\n  - Sets (JJ, 99, 66)\n  - Two pairs (J9, J6, 96)\n  - Flush draws\n  - Straight draws (QT, T8, 87)\n- However, I still have the best hand most of the time\n\n**Opponent Analysis (MiniMax-M2 in seat 4):**\nFrom the opponent history:\n- Very tight preflop player (folds most hands)\n- When they do play, they tend to be straightforward\n- On the flop, they've bet in several hands (hands 9, 31, 33, 40)\n- They seem to bet with made hands or strong draws\n- They folded on flop in hands 39, 44 when facing pressure\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- MiniMax-M2 called my 4x preflop raise (32 chips)\n- Now they're betting 24 into a 92 chip pot on the flop\n- This is a relatively small bet (about 26% pot)\n- They could have:\n  - A Jack (AJ, KJ, QJ, JT)\n  - A flush draw\n  - A straight draw\n  - A set (less likely but possible)\n  - Two pair\n  - Or they could be testing with air\n\n**My Decision:**\nWith pocket aces on this board, I should:\n1. **Raise for value** - I likely have the best hand\n2. **Protect against draws** - There are flush and straight draws possible\n3. **Get information** - A raise will tell me where I stand\n4. **Build the pot** - When I have the best hand, I want to win a big pot\n\nGiven the board texture and my strong hand, I should raise. The minimum raise is 48, but I should raise more to:\n- Charge draws properly\n- Get value from weaker hands\n- Protect my hand\n\nA good raise size would be around 3x their bet (72-80 chips total), or about 75% of the pot. Since the pot is 92 + 24 = 116, and I need to call 24, raising to about 80-90 total seems appropriate.\n\nLet me raise to 80 chips total (56 more than the call). This is a solid raise that charges draws and gets value from weaker hands.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 80,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have an overpair (pocket aces) on a coordinated board with possible flush and straight draws. Opponent is tight but betting small (26% pot). I need to raise for value, protect against draws, and get information.

No pair, no draw, nothing.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position, but doesn't help much with this hand.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is the only opponent left. Looking at their history:\n   - They fold a lot preflop (hands 45, 46, 48, 49, 51)\n   - They called in hand 50 but folded on the flop after seeing a bet\n   - In hand 52, they called 24 preflop, bet 24 on the flop, then folded\n   - They seem to play somewhat tight/passive\n\n4. **Action**: They checked to me on the flop. This is a strong indication they don't have a monster hand. With Ad Kc Qd on the board, if they had an Ace, King, or Queen, or a strong draw, they might have bet.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is 16 chips. If I bet, I could potentially win it.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 283 chips (35.4 BB), which is a healthy stack. I can afford to take some small risks, but I shouldn't be reckless.\n\nThis is a good spot for a continuation bet/bluff. The board is very scary (broadway cards), and my opponent checked, showing weakness. I can represent having an Ace, King, or Queen. \n\nGiven that my opponent has shown a tendency to fold to aggression (folded on flop in hand 50 after calling preflop, and folded in hand 52 after betting), a bet here seems profitable.\n\nMinimum raise to is 8 (which would be a bet of 8 into a pot of 16). That's a reasonable half-pot bet. I could also go a bit larger to 12-16.\n\nLet me make a standard continuation bet. I'll bet 12 chips (3/4 pot) which is a good size to put pressure and represents strength.",

The turn card (Jc) completes both potential straights and brings a 3rd club for a flush draw.\n\n**My hand:** I have absolutely nothing - just 7-high with no draw.\n\n**Opponent's likely range:**\nGiven they called preflop from SB and called my flop bet, they likely have:\n- Some piece of this board (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, or club draw)\n- Possibly a made straight with T-x\n- Two pair or a set\n- Strong draw (flush draw with a pair)\n\n**Decision analysis:**\n1. I have zero equity with 7-high\n2. The board is very scary with multiple draws completing\n3. Opponent called my flop bet, suggesting they have something\n4. They're now checking the turn - this could be:\n   - Weakness (missed draw)\n   - Trap with a monster (made straight, two pair)\n   - Pot control with top pair\n\n5. Pot is 40 chips, betting would commit more chips with no hand\n6. I have position and can see a free river card\n7. My opponent is short-stacked and could be trapping\n\n**Conclusion:** Checking is the clear best option. I have absolutely no hand, no draws, and no reason to bet. I should take the free river card and hope to improve, though even if I hit a 7 or 5 it likely won't be good on this board. Folding is not an option since checking is free. Raising would be pure bluffing with no equity, which is not advisable against a player who has shown strength by calling flop.\n\nThe best play is to check and see a free river.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation step by step:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- My cards: 7c 5s (7 of clubs, 5 of spades)\n- Board: Ad Kc Qd Jc 4s (Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 4)\n- Position: BTN (button)\n- My stack: 271 chips (33.9 BB)\n- Pot: 52 chips\n- River bet: 12 chips to call\n- Minimum raise: 24 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nMy hand is 7-5 offsuit. The board shows A-K-Q-J-4. This is a very coordinated board with four cards to a straight (10 would make a straight). I have absolutely nothing - no pair, no straight draw, no flush draw. My best hand is Ace high.\n\n**Opponent Analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nLooking at the opponent's history:\n- They tend to fold a lot preflop\n- When they do play, they sometimes bet aggressively (like in hand 40 and 52)\n- In hand 52, they called 24 preflop, bet 24 on flop, then folded\n- They seem capable of bluffing but also folding to pressure\n\n**Current Hand Action:**\n- Preflop: They called SB (4 chips) and I checked BB\n- Flop: They checked, I bet 12, they called\n- Turn: They checked, I checked\n- River: They bet 12\n\nThe river bet is small (less than 1/4 pot). This could be:\n1. A value bet with a strong hand\n2. A blocking bet with a marginal hand\n3. A bluff\n\nGiven the board texture (very scary with 4 to a straight), and the fact that they called my flop bet, they could have:\n- A pair (maybe Ace-x, King-x, Queen-x)\n- Two pair\n- A straight (if they have T-9 or T-x)\n- A flush draw that missed (but there are only 2 clubs on board)\n- Complete air/bluff\n\n**My situation:**\n- I have absolutely nothing\n- The bet is small relative to pot (12 to win 52 = 23% pot odds)\n- I need to be good ~19% of the time to break even on a call\n- However, I have no showdown value\n\n**Decision:**\nI should fold. I have no hand, no draw, and while the bet is small, I'm not getting the right odds to call with just Ace-high. The opponent could easily have any pair or better. Even if they're bluffing sometimes, it's not worth risking chips with such a weak hand. I need to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nI cannot raise as a bluff because:\n1. I have no equity if called\n2. The opponent has shown they can call bets\n3. My stack is healthy and I don't need to take high-risk bluffs right now",

Fold - conservative, preserves stack\n2. Call - see flop with pocket pair, hoping to hit set\n3. Raise - take initiative, but out of position\n\nGiven I'm out of position with a small pocket pair, and I have a healthy stack, I think the best play is to either fold or call. Calling is reasonable given the pot odds and implied odds if I hit a set. However, playing out of position is difficult.\n\nLet me think about the raise sizing. If I raise to 24, I'm risking 24 to win 28, and I'll still be out of position. This seems like a high-risk play with a marginal hand.\n\nI think calling is the best option here. The pot odds are good (2.33:1), and if I hit a set on the flop, I can potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold to further aggression.",

Given the board texture and their aggression, they likely have:\n- A T (AT, KT, QT, JT, T9, T8)\n- An overpair (JJ+)\n- A strong draw (J9, 9J, two hearts)\n- Possibly 88 or 77 for a set\n\n**Decision:**\nI have a weak underpair on a very dangerous board. I should check and see what they do. If they bet, I'll likely need to fold unless it's a very small bet that gives me good odds. Checking is the standard play here with a marginal hand.\n\nI don't want to bet because:\n1. I'm likely behind to any pair\n2. Many turn cards are bad for me (any T, 8, 7, 9, J, 6, or heart)\n3. I have showdown value but not betting value\n4. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to possibly get to showdown cheaply\n\nLet me check.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I have pocket 5s (5d 5s) in BB\n- Flop: 8h 7s Tc\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- I need to call 24 chips\n- I have 255 chips left (31.9 BB)\n- Only opponent: MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4 with 96 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have a pocket pair of 5s\n- The flop is 8h 7s Tc - very coordinated board with straight draws\n- I have an underpair to the board (all three cards are higher than my 5s)\n- No flush draw, but there are straight possibilities (9-6, J-9)\n- I have a backdoor straight draw if I hit a 6\n\n**Opponent Analysis - MiniMax-M2:**\nFrom the search results, I can see MiniMax-M2's patterns:\n- Hand 44: Called preflop with 9d Kh, folded to flop bet on 4d 4s 9h board\n- Hand 46: Folded preflop\n- Hand 48: Folded to preflop raise\n- Hand 50: Called preflop with 4s Qs, then folded to a 3-bet\n- Hand 52: Called preflop raise with unknown hand, bet flop on Jd 9d 6s, then folded to raise\n- Hand 53: Called preflop from SB, called flop bet, then bet river and won\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 seems to call preflop with marginal hands, sometimes bets flops, but can fold to pressure. They have a relatively short stack (96 chips = 12 BB).\n\n**Current Action:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 raised to 16, I called 12\n- Flop: I checked, they bet 24 (a 1/3 pot bet)\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 64\n- To call: 24\n- Pot odds: 64:24 or ~2.67:1\n- I need ~27% equity to call\n\n**Equity Analysis:**\nWith pocket 5s on this board, I likely have:\n- Beating: Pure bluffs, lower pairs (but none lower than 5s exist)\n- Losing: Any pair 8+, any straight draw, any two pair+\n\nGiven the coordinated board (8-7-T), MiniMax-M2 could have:\n- Any pair (8s, 7s, Ts, Jx, 9x)\n- Straight draws (J9, 96, etc.)\n- Two pair+ hands\n- Pure bluffs\n\nMy equity is likely very low here. Even against a pure bluff with two overcards, I'm only ~50%. Against any pair or draw, I'm crushed.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (31.9 BB)\n- MiniMax-M2 is short (12 BB)\n- This is a tournament - preserving chips is important\n- Calling here would commit me further with a weak hand\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. I have an underpair on a coordinated board with multiple draws possible. The opponent bet into me, showing strength. Even if they're bluffing sometimes, I don't have enough equity to call, and I don't want to invest more chips with such a weak holding. \n\nFolding preserves my stack for better spots. If I call 24 here, the pot becomes 88, and I'll likely face more pressure on the turn with the same weak hand.\n\nThe only argument for continuing might be if MiniMax-M2 is extremely aggressive and bluffing often, but even then, I have very little to fight back with. My hand has almost no improvement potential (only 2 outs to a set, which is still vulnerable to straights).\n\nI should fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - best position\n- Cards: 7c Jd (offsuit, low-medium connectors)\n- Stack: 255 chips (31.9 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- To call: 8 chips\n- Min raise: 16 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - Recent history shows mostly folding preflop (hands 49, 52, 53, 54 all folded). In hand 50, they made a big raise to 60 then 164 (likely had premium hand). In hand 51, they called SB and checked down to fold on turn. Showdown history shows they play premium pairs (TT) and suited connectors (Ts6s).\n  \n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - Very tight player. Has folded preflop in hands 49, 50, 52, 53, 54. In hand 51, they checked down and made a river bet. Showdowns show they play Ax hands (A2o) and small pairs (22). Seems conservative.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- J7o is a marginal hand, especially offsuit\n- I'm on the button - best position\n- Both opponents appear tight based on recent history\n- The BB (DeepSeek) has been very tight, folding most hands\n- Pot odds: 8 to win 12 = 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed\n- J7o vs random hand has about ~45% equity\n- But against tight ranges, equity drops significantly\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Position: Excellent (on button)\n2. Hand strength: Weak (J7o)\n3. Opponents: Both appear tight\n4. Stack depth: Good (31.9 BB)\n5. Tournament: Need to accumulate chips but avoid marginal spots\n\n**Recommendation:**\nGiven the tight nature of both opponents and my position, I could consider a steal raise. However, J7o is very weak and if called, I'll be out of position postflop (though I'm on button, so I'd have position). \n\nActually, wait - I'm ON the button, so I have position on both players postflop. That's a huge advantage.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n- Both opponents fold a lot preflop\n- I'm on button\n\n\n- 8 chips is 2.5% of my stack\n- If I raise to 16 (2x BB), I'm risking 6.3% of my stack to win 1.5% of my stack\n\nI'll take a calculated risk and call. The minimal investment with position against tight opponents makes this a worthwhile speculative play. The pot odds are decent, and I'm getting a discount to see the flop. If I miss completely, I can easily fold. If I hit a strong draw or pair, I can leverage my position to potentially take down the pot.\n\nThe button position provides maximum flexibility. I'll see the flop cheaply and can make a move if the board texture favors my hand or allows a strategic bluff. This low-risk approach lets me gather information while maintaining my stack's integrity.",

J7 offsuit missed completely\n- Board shows K-T-3 rainbow. I have no pair, no draw, no backdoor flush draw\n- My hand has very little equity against any reasonable BB defending range\n\n**Opponent Analysis (DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nFrom the hand history:\n- Very tight player - folded preflop in 6 of last 10 hands\n- Only saw showdown once in hand 51 where they checked, called turn, then bet river\n- Generally passive, checking frequently\n\nGiven that this player is tight and checked the flop, they likely have:\n- A weak hand that missed the board\n- Some marginal showdown value\n- Or they could be trapping with a strong hand (less likely given their tight nature)\n\n**Position & Stack:**\n- I'm on the button with position advantage\n- Healthy stack of 30.9 BB\n- Pot is small (20 chips)\n\n**Decision:**\nWith absolutely no hand equity (J-high), I should not be betting here. The opponent is tight and has shown weakness by checking. I could consider a bluff, but:\n1. My hand has no backup equity if called\n2. The opponent might call with any pair or even A-high\n3. The pot is small, not worth risking chips\n4. Better to preserve my stack for better spots\n\nChecking behind is the clear best option here.

I need a Jack to make a pair (3 outs), or a 7 to make a pair (3 outs), but that's only 6 outs total, giving me about 12% equity.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the recall, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in most hands (hands 39-47, 49-50, 52-54)\n- Only raised once preflop (hand 48)\n- In hand 51, they checked flop, checked turn, called 20 on turn, then bet 20 on river\n\nThis suggests DeepSeek-V3.2 is a tight player who bets with strong hands. Their turn bet of 12 into a pot of 32 suggests strength.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 32\n- Bet: 12\n- Total pot if I call: 44\n- I need to call 12 to win 44\n- Pot odds: 12/44 = 27%\n- My equity is likely much lower than this (maybe 10-15% at best)\n\n\nI'll cut my losses and fold. The opponent's tight betting pattern and my weak hand make continuing too risky. The pot odds don't justify chasing such a slim chance of improving.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the hand:\n- I'm on the BTN with AcTs (ace-ten suited)\n- I have 239 chips (29.9 BB) - a bit below average\n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 20 chips\n- Opponent in Seat 2 (also named Kimi-K2) called 8 chips\n- Everyone else folded\n\nI need to check on the opponent in Seat 2. They just called from what appears to be MP (seat 2). Let me analyze their tendencies:\n\nFrom the recall data:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been very tight - lots of folds\n- When they do raise, they've raised to 24 (3x BB) and sometimes larger\n- In hand 50 they raised to 60 then 164 (big pot)\n- In hand 51 they called 4 then check-folded on turn\n- They just called 8 here, which is unusual - they usually fold or raise\n\nThis limp-call from a typically tight player suggests:\n1. They might have a medium strength hand\n2. They could be trying to trap with a monster\n3. They're getting more aggressive or changing strategy\n\nMy hand: AcTs is a good hand on the button. It's:\n- Playable from BTN vs one opponent\n- Has good equity against most ranges\n- Can hit strong top pair, straight draws, nut flush draw\n\nPosition: I'm on the BTN, which is excellent position. I have the advantage of acting last postflop.\n\nStack size: I have 29.9 BB, which is workable but not deep. I should avoid marginal all-in situations.\n\nDecision: I have the option to check (free flop) or raise. \n\nChecking: I get to see a free flop with a decent hand in position. This is low risk.\n\nRaising: I could raise to isolate, but the pot is already 20 and I'd need to raise to at least 16 more (total 24). This would be a 3x raise over the call.\n \nI'm sensing a shift in the opponent's behavior. Their recent limp-call breaks from their typical tight pattern. This could indicate a more nuanced strategy or a change in their playing style. I'll cautiously check to gather more information on the flop, keeping my options open while minimizing risk.",

This is a trash hand that should be folded in most situations.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Recent actions show they folded in hand 55, raised in 56, called in 57, then checked multiple times in hand 58. They seem somewhat passive/tricky. Showdowns show they had Ts6s (missed draw) and TT (set).\n- Seat 3 (BB): Very tight - folded preflop in hands 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58. Only played hand 51 (made a river bet) and hand 55 (checked then turn bet). Showdowns show they had A2 (ace high), 22 (set), and 5sKs (trips). They seem to only play strong hands.\n\nGiven:\n1. My hand is terrible (4s 9c offsuit)\n2. I'm on the button which is good position, but not enough to compensate for such a weak hand\n3. The BB player is very tight - if I call and they have a real hand, I'll be in trouble\n4. I have to call 8 chips to win 12 (1.5:1 pot odds) which is not enough for this hand\n5. I have a decent stack of 31.9 BB and should preserve it\n\nThis is an easy fold. The hand has no potential, I'm facing a tight opponent in the BB, and calling would just be throwing chips away.",

It's not connected, not suited, and both cards are low.\n\n2. **Position**: BB (big blind) - I'm out of position post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 in Seat 3 has raised to 48 (3x the BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They fold most of the time preflop (hands 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58)\n   - When they do raise preflop (hand 59), they bet aggressively on the flop\n   - They seem to be a relatively tight player who folds often\n   - Their stack is 169 chips (about 10.5 BB), so they're in a similar situation to me\n\n4. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is 72 chips\n   - I need to call 32 chips\n   - Pot odds: 72:32 or 2.25:1\n   - This means I need ~31% equity to call profitably\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: \n   - I have 239 chips (14.9 BB)\n   - This is a relatively short stack in tournament terms\n   - I should be selective with my hands and avoid marginal spots\n\n6. **Hand equity**: 3c 9d has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a wide range, this hand performs very poorly.\n\n7. **Tournament situation**: With 14.9 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. Calling here with a trash hand out of position would be a mistake.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, I'm out of position, and I should preserve my tournament stack for better opportunities. The 32 chips I'm risking might not seem like much, but it's over 13% of my stack on a hand that has very little chance of winning.\n\nEven though the opponent appears to be tight and might be stealing, 3-9 offsuit is just too weak to defend with, especially when I have to invest 32 chips (13.4% of my stack).",

Not a hand I want to play.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions post-flop (I'll be acting first).\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's actions:\n   - They raise to 32 (2x the BB) from Seat 4\n   - Recent history shows they fold a lot preflop (hands 55, 56, 57, 59, 61)\n   - When they do play, they show aggression (hand 54: raise pre, bet flop; hand 58: call pre, bet turn and river; hand 60: call pre, bet flop)\n   - Their raise here suggests real strength\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 231 chips (14.4 BB) - this is a short stack in tournament terms\n   - MiniMax-M2 has 68 chips (4.25 BB) - they are very short\n   - The BB (Seat 2) has 392 chips (24.5 BB)\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 24 chips to win 56 (current pot) = 56:24 or about 2.3:1. This is not great odds for a hand this weak.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 14.4 BB, I need to be selective. This is not a spot to invest chips with a weak hand out of position. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nThe raise from MiniMax-M2, given their tendency to fold often preflop, suggests they have a real hand here. My J4o is dominated by almost any reasonable raising hand.\n\nI should fold.",

Complete trash.\n\nLet me think about this:\n1. Hand strength: 2-5 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. No connectivity, no suitedness, low cards.\n2. Position: I'm on the Button which is great, but not enough to play this hand.\n3. Stack size: 14.4 BB is getting short but not desperate yet. I need to preserve my stack for better spots.\n4. Pot odds: I need to call 16 to win 24, which is 1.5:1. That's not good enough for this hand.\n5. Opponents: I should check if there's any relevant history, but with 2-5 offsuit, it doesn't really matter.\n\nThis is a clear fold. I don't need to check opponent history for this decision - it's a trivial fold with a trash hand when I still have a workable stack.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. With 14.4 BB, I am getting short. Could this be a spot to shove? No, that's not right. With 2-5 offsuit, even on the button, this is a fold. I need to preserve my chips for better hands or better spots. The only consideration might be if the blinds are extremely tight and I could steal, but with 14.4 BB and two players left to act, and with a hand this bad, it's still a fold.\n\nActually, wait. Let me think about tournament dynamics. At 14.4 BB, I'm not in desperate territory yet. I can wait for a better hand. Stealing with 2-5 offsuit is just burning chips. Even if both opponents fold 70% of the time, it's not profitable with this hand and these stack sizes.\n\nClear fold.",

From early position, you typically want to play much tighter.\n\n2. **Stack Size**: With only 14.4 BB, I'm in the danger zone. Tournament survival is a concern. I need to be selective about when to commit chips.\n\n3. **Position**: UTG is the worst position. I'll have to act first postflop, which is a huge disadvantage.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recent history:\n   - Seat 3 has been aggressive (raised in hand 61)\n   - Seat 4 has been active and raised in hand 62\n   - There's potential for someone to raise behind me\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a short stack, I should be looking for spots to either:\n   - Shove all-in with a strong hand\n   - Fold marginal hands to preserve chips\n   - Open raise to steal blinds\n\n6. **Pot odds**: 16 chips to win 24 (1.5:1) - not really relevant preflop from UTG\n\n**Decision**: This is a fold. QTs from UTG with a short stack is too risky. If I call 16 chips (1 BB), I'm committing ~7% of my stack with a marginal hand out of position. Someone could easily raise behind me, forcing me to fold anyway. I need to preserve my chips for better spots, preferably in later position or with stronger hands.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

My opponent is aggressive but checked, which could indicate weakness or a trap. With a short stack of 12.4 BB, I need to preserve chips. Checking allows me to see a free card with some showdown value while avoiding a potential check-raise from a strong hand or draw.\"\n}\n```",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the button (BTN) with 5h 6h\n- Stack: 199 chips (12.4 BB) - quite short\n- Board: 6c Qc 8c\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in SB (Seat 4) with 100 chips\n- On the flop, opponent checked\n\n**My hand:** I have bottom pair with 6h, plus a backdoor flush draw (hearts) and a gutshot straight draw (7 for a straight).\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at the opponent history for MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):\n- They seem to be an aggressive player who frequently bets and raises\n- They make continuation bets often (hands 54, 58, 60)\n- They've shown they can fold preflop (hands 55, 56, 57, 59, 61, 63)\n- They called preflop and then bet on flop in hand 60\n- They check-called in hand 53, then checked turn and bet river\n- They raised preflop in hands 54 and 62\n\nThe fact that they checked to me on this flop is interesting. This is a very coordinated board with three clubs. They might have:\n1. A weak hand that missed completely\n2. A strong hand like a made flush or top pair that wants to trap\n3. A draw that wants to see a free card\n\n**My situation:** I'm short-stacked with 12.4 BB. I need to accumulate chips or I'll be blinded out. I have bottom pair which might be good, but there are many scary cards that can come (any club, any Q, any 8, any 7, any overcard).\n\n**Pot odds:** The pot is 64 and I can check for free. If I bet, I need to consider what size.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I have a weak made hand (bottom pair)\n2. The board is very wet and dangerous\n3. My opponent is aggressive but checked\n4. I'm short-stacked and need to win pots\n5. I have some equity with my pair and backdoor draws\n\nGiven my short stack and the fact that I'm on the button with some showdown value, I think checking is the best play. Betting here would be a semi-bluff, but:\n- My opponent is aggressive and might check-raise\n- I don't have a strong draw (no flush draw, only gutshot)\n- My hand has some showdown value that I might realize for free\n- If I bet and get called, I'm in tough spot on turn\n\nI should check behind and see a free card, hoping to improve or get to showdown cheaply.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I'm very short-stacked (12.4 BB). The pot is already 64 chips, which is about 32% of my stack. If I bet around 32-40 chips (half pot), I could:\n1. Take down the pot right now\n2. Charge draws to continue\n3. Set up a turn shove\n\nBut if I get check-raised, I'd be in a tough spot. Given the coordinated board and that my opponent checked, they might be trapping with a strong hand.\n\nI think the safest and most correct play is to check. I have some showdown value, and I don't want to build a big pot with just bottom pair on a dangerous board.",

I have a decent draw with some showdown value. The opponent's bet of 80 into 144 is a relatively strong bet (55% of pot). Given the opponent's history of making smaller bets and folding to pressure, this larger bet suggests strength.\n\nHowever, I have:\n1. A made hand (pair of 6s)\n2. An open-ended straight draw (8 outs)\n3. The pot is already large relative to my stack\n\nLet me calculate my equity roughly:\n- 8 outs for the straight (4s and 9s) = ~16% chance on river\n- 2 outs for trips (6s) = ~4% chance\n- 3 outs for two pair (5s) = ~6% chance\n- Total outs: ~13 = ~26% chance\n\nBut wait, some of these outs might be tainted by the flush draw. The 4c and 9c would complete the flush which my opponent might have.\n\nActually, the board has 6c Qc 8c. If I hit a 4c or 9c, that would make 4 clubs on board. I only have 5h 6h, so I don't have a club. Hitting a club could be dangerous.\n\nLet me reconsider:\n- Clean outs: 4d, 4s, 4h, 9d, 9s, 9h = 6 outs for straight\n- 6 outs = ~12% chance\n- Plus 2 outs for trips (6d, 6s) = 4%\n- Plus 3 outs for two pair (5d, 5s, 5c) = 6%\n- Total: ~22% equity\n\nPot odds require 35.7% equity. This is not a profitable call based on pure pot odds.\n\nHowever, there are implied odds considerations. If I hit my straight, I might win my opponent's remaining stack (20 chips). But that's only 20 more chips.\n\nWait, the opponent only has 20 chips left! They bet 80, but they only have 20 chips remaining. If I call 80, the opponent cannot bet on the river - they will be all-in or have very little left.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- Opponent stack: 20 chips\n- If I call 80, pot will be 224 on river\n- Opponent will have 20 left, which is less than 10% of pot\n- They would likely be committed\n\nGiven the opponent's tiny remaining stack and my decent draw with some showdown value, I think this is actually a call.

But mathematically it's not profitable.\n\nActually, let me reconsider more carefully. The opponent bet 80 into 144. That's a strong bet. They have 20 left. They could have:\n- A made flush\n- A set\n- Two pair\n\n\n- A strong draw\n\nI'm facing a critical decision. The opponent's bet suggests strength, but their tiny stack limits my potential loss. With a pair and straight draw, I'm tempted to call despite the unfavorable pot odds. The risk is limited to 80 chips, potentially leaving me with 119 chips if I lose.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - great position\n- Cards: Qc 4h - offsuit, low kicker, not a strong hand\n- Stack: 191 chips (11.9 BB) - getting short\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 8 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at Kimi-K2's recent actions:\n- Hand 60: Raised preflop to 24, then called 40 on flop, bet 120 on turn (aggressive)\n- Hands 61-65: Folded 4 times in a row preflop (tight)\n- Hand 59: Called preflop, then folded on flop\n- Hand 58: Checked through, called turn, folded river\n\nKimi-K2 seems to be playing somewhat tight recently, folding a lot preflop. They were aggressive in hand 60 but have been folding since.\n\n**My Recent Play:**\nLooking at my last 10 hands:\n- I've been folding a LOT (8 out of 10 hands)\n- When I did play: Won hand 57 with AT from BB, lost hand 65 when I raised with 56s and folded on turn\n- Generally playing tight, which is appropriate given my short stack\n\n**Decision Making:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Q4o is a weak hand. Q-high with a 4 kicker is not playable in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is the best position, but that doesn't make up for the poor hand quality.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: At 11.9 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate yet. I should be selective and look for spots to shove or steal, but Q4o is too weak even for a steal attempt.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot preflop lately (4 folds in a row), so they might be tight. However, they could also be due to defend. Even if they're tight, Q4o is just too weak to play.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, getting 3:1 odds. This might seem tempting, but with Q4o I'm rarely going to hit a strong enough hand to continue postflop, and I'll be out of position after the flop (since I'm SB/BB relative to the opponent).\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 11.9 BB, I should preserve my stack for better spots. Q4o is not a hand I want to invest chips in.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold. This is an easy fold despite the good position and decent pot odds. The hand is simply too weak to play, especially with a short stack where I need to be selective.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the hand:\n\n**My hand**: K\u26609\u2665 - This is a marginal hand. King-high but with a weak kicker (9). Not suited, not connected.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is excellent position, the best at the table.\n\n**Stack**: 191 chips = 11.9 BB - This is a short stack. In tournament poker, this is in the \"push/fold\" territory, though I have enough chips for one more orbit.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 384 chips - relatively active, has shown aggression with raises and calls\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 225 chips - seems tight, folding a lot preflop\n\n**Pot odds**: Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1), which is 40% equity needed.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: K9o is marginal. It plays poorly against tight ranges and is easily dominated by KQ, KJ, KT, AK, etc.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is great, but with a short stack and a marginal hand, position advantage is limited.\n3. **Stack size**: At 11.9 BB, I should be thinking about push/fold. A standard raise would commit too much of my stack.\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 2 (SB): Has been active, calling and raising. Showed down TT (pocket tens) and Ts6s previously.\n   - Seat 3 (BB): Very tight, folding most preflop hands. Only active when raising (48 chip raise in hand 61).\n5. **Tournament situation**: With a short stack, I need to preserve chips for better spots or look for spots to steal blinds.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. K9o is too weak to risk 16 chips (8% of my stack) against potentially strong ranges. The SB has shown aggression and could easily have me dominated. The BB is tight but could wake up with a strong hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot, preferably in late position with a stronger hand or when I can go all-in as a steal.\n\nHowever, given my short stack and button position, I could also consider an all-in steal. Let me reconsider:\n\n- If I go all-in for 191, I'm risking 191 to win 24 (immediate pot) + potentially both blinds (8+16 = 24) = 48 total.\n- This is about 4:1 pot odds for the opponents, making it unattractive for them to call without strong hands.\n- Given the BB is very tight, they might fold often.\n- The SB has been more active but might still fold to an all-in.\n\nBut K9o is really marginal for an all-in. I should save my tournament life for better spots. Folding is the disciplined play.",

I have to act first postflop.\n\n**Stack**: 191 chips (11.9 BB) - This is a short stack, but not desperate yet.\n\n**Pot**: 24 chips (1.5 BB)\n\n**Situation**: I need to call 16 chips (1 BB) to see the flop.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Q2 offsuit is trash. It's not suited, has no connectivity, and the 2 is worthless. Even if I hit a Q, I'm often dominated by better kickers.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is terrible. I'll be out of position against everyone else.\n\n3. **Stack size**: At 11.9 BB, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold. I shouldn't be calling and playing postflop with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, I can see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 is somewhat active (called in hand 65, made a big bet of 80 on turn)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 is very short (8 chips) and seems aggressive (made a big raise of 225 in hand 67)\n   - Kimi-K2 is the big stack and seems capable of making big calls\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a short stack, I need to preserve my chips for better spots. Q2 offsuit from UTG is definitely not a spot to invest chips.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I'm getting 24:16 or 1.5:1 pot odds, which is not enough to justify calling with this garbage hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold.

Opponent in seat 3 appears tight based on history (folds most hands, raises with strong holdings like JJ). At 10.9 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots where I can be the aggressor rather than calling raises out of position with weak kickers.\"\n}\n```",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current hand:**\n- My position: BB (Seat 1)\n- My cards: 3h As (Ace-Three offsuit)\n- My stack: 175 chips (10.9 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 56 chips\n- Amount to call: 16\n- Minimum raise to: 48\n\n**Action so far:**\n- SB posted 8\n- BB posted 16 (me)\n- Seat 2 folded\n- Seat 3 raised to 32\n- Seat 4 folded\n\n**Opponent analysis (Seat 3 - DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nLooking at their preflop actions from the recall:\n- They fold a lot (hands 56, 57, 58, 62, 64, 65, 66)\n- When they raise: hand 59 (24), hand 61 (48), hand 67 (225 - all-in)\n- When they call: hand 60 (20), hand 68 (8)\n- Showdowns: JJ, 99-TT, 22, 5s-Ks, As-2s\n\nThis suggests they play fairly tight and their raises typically represent strong hands. The raise to 32 (2x BB) is relatively small.\n\n**My situation:**\n- I have As-3h - a decent but not great hand\n- I'm getting 3.5:1 pot odds (56:16)\n- I have 10.9 BB left, which is getting short\n- The opponent appears to be tight-aggressive when they do enter pots\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: As-3h is marginal. The ace is good but the kicker is weak.\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB, so I'll act first postflop - disadvantageous\n3. **Stack size**: At 10.9 BB, I'm in the danger zone. I need to be careful about committing chips.\n4. **Opponent tendency**: Opponent appears tight, so their raise likely means strength\n5. **Pot odds**: 3.5:1 is decent but not great given my hand strength and position\n\nGiven that I'm out of position with a marginal hand against a tight opponent who has shown strength, and I'm short-stacked, I should fold here. The risk of losing more chips postflop when I'm out of position isn't worth it. I should preserve my stack for better spots, especially when I can be the aggressor.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The pot is 56 and I need to call 16. That's 3.5:1 pot odds. With an Ace, I might be ahead sometimes. But I'm out of position and short-stacked. \n\nActually, looking at my stack more carefully: 175 chips at 8/16 blinds means I have 10.9 BB. This is a critical stack size where I need to be very selective. \n\nThe opponent raised to 32, which is 2x BB. This could be a steal attempt. However, given their tight history, it's more likely a value raise.\n\nI think folding is the best option. I don't want to risk my tournament life on A3o out of position against a tight opponent's raise.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - great position\n- Cards: T\u2665 6\u2665 (Ten of Hearts, Six of Hearts) - suited connectors\n- Stack: 167 chips (10.4 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - 577 chips, seems to be a solid player with some strong hands shown (AA, 66)\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - 64 chips (4 BB), very short stack, seems aggressive preflop\n\n**Opponent Tendencies from Memory:**\nKimi-K2 (Seat 2):\n- Has been folding a lot preflop (hands 64, 65, 69, 70)\n- Made raises in hands 67 and 68 (showed AA in hand 68)\n- When they raised, they showed strong hands\n- Generally seems tight-aggressive\n\nDeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3):\n- Also folds a lot (hands 64, 65, 66)\n- Made big raises in hands 67 (225), 69 (32), 70 (56)\n- Hand 67 showed JJ, so they can make big raises with strong pairs\n- In hand 68 they just called with T9\n- Seems to be getting more aggressive recently\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: T6 suited is a marginal hand. It's suited and connected, which gives some potential, but it's not a strong starting hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position. This means I'll act last postflop.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes**: \n   - I'm short-stacked at 10.4 BB\n   - BB is very short at 4 BB (64 chips)\n   - SB is deep at 36 BB\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: With 10.4 BB, I'm in the danger zone. I need to be selective about when I commit chips. However, I'm getting good odds to call (16 to win 24, or 1.5:1).\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1). Against random hands, T6s has about 35-40% equity, so the pot odds aren't quite good enough for a pure call based on equity alone.\n\n6. **Implied Odds**: If I hit a strong hand (flush or straight), I could win a big pot, especially against the deep-stacked SB.\n\n**Decision**: \nGiven that I'm on the button with a suited connector, getting decent pot odds, and the BB is very short and might shove, I think calling is reasonable. However, T6s is quite weak. \n\nThe BB has been aggressive and might defend their blind. If they shove (which they could with 64 chips), I'd have to call 48 more chips into a pot of 88, getting less than 2:1 odds.\n\nWith a short stack of 10.4 BB, I should be more selective. T6s is not strong enough to call here, especially when the BB is aggressive and short. Folding is the best option to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. On the button with a suited hand, getting 1.5:1 odds, and position... it's borderline. But given my short stack and the fact that the BB is aggressive and might shove, I think folding is safer. I need to preserve my chips for better hands.\n\nWait, let me think again. With 10.4 BB, I'm in push/fold territory for many hands. T6s is not strong enough to shove, and calling risks getting into a difficult postflop spot. The BB is very short and aggressive, which increases the risk of them shoving.\n\nI think the best play is to **fold**. Preserve my stack for a better spot, preferably with a stronger hand or against weaker opponents.",

          "content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 4c 7d (bottom pair with 4)\n- Board: Kc 4s Ks (two Kings, one 4)\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- To call: 48 chips\n- My stack: 151 chips (9.4 BB)\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in SB position, bet 48 on the flop\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have a pair of 4s on a K-K-4 board. This means I have trips (three of a kind) with 4s. This is actually a very strong hand! The board is K-K-4, so I have 4-4-4-K-K (full house, 4s full of Kings).\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall data on MiniMax-M2:\n- They fold preflop frequently (hands 59, 61, 63, 66-71)\n- When they do play, they bet aggressively on flops (hand 60: bet 40, hand 65: bet 80 on turn)\n- In hand 60, they bet 40 on flop, then checked turn and folded\n- They seem to be a relatively tight-aggressive player who folds a lot preflop but bets when they have something\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 80\n- To call: 48\n- Pot odds: 80:48 or ~1.67:1\n- This is about 37.5% equity needed to call\n\n**My Situation:**\n- I have a full house (4s full of Kings)\n- This is an extremely strong hand, likely the best hand\n- The only hands beating me would be K-x (trip Kings) or pocket Ks/KK (four of a kind)\n- Given opponent's betting pattern, they could have:\n  - A King (top pair)\n  - A pocket pair\n  - Some draw\n  - Complete bluff\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\n- I have 151 chips, which is short at 9.4 BB\n- I need to accumulate chips or I'll be blinded out\n- This is a strong hand to get my money in with\n\n**Decision:**\nI should raise here. I have a full house and need to build the pot and protect against any potential draws (though there aren't many dangerous draws on this board). A King would be the main concern, but even then I have trips and am likely ahead.\n\nMinimum raise is to 96, but I could also go all-in for 151. Given my short stack and the strength of my hand, going all-in makes sense to maximize pressure and potentially get called by worse hands.\n\nLet me think about the sizing:\n- If I raise to 96, that leaves me with 55 chips\n- If I just go all-in for 151, I put maximum pressure\n\nWith a full house on this board, I want to get value. Going all-in might fold out some hands, but given my short stack and the pot size, it's a reasonable play. However, a smaller raise might keep in more hands.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the board: Kc 4s Ks\nI have 4c 7d, so I have trip 4s, not a full house. The board is K-K-4, so if I have a 4, I have three 4s. That's trip 4s, which loses to any K-x hand (trip Kings).\n\nSo I have trip 4s, and the opponent could easily have a King. If they have any King, they have trip Kings which beats my trip 4s.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- Board: K-K-4\n- My hand: 4-7\n- My hand: 4-4-4-K-K (trip 4s with K-K kickers)\n- If opponent has K-x: K-K-K-4-x (trip Kings with 4 kicker) - they win\n\nSo I'm losing to any King. What are the chances they have a King?\n- They called preflop from SB after I checked as BB\n- They could have a wide range: any pocket pair, any two broadway, any suited connectors, any King\n- The flop bet of 48 into a pot of 32 (after preflop action) is a 1.5x pot bet, which is strong\n\nGiven this, I might be behind. Let me think about the opponent's pattern:\n- They bet 40 on flop in hand 60, then checked turn and folded - suggests they bet for value/protection but gave up\n- They bet 80 on turn in hand 65 - strong bet\n\nThe bet of 48 here is quite large relative to the pot. This suggests strength.\n\n**Revised Decision:**\nI have trip 4s but any King beats me."

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - great position\n- Cards: Qh 7c (offsuit, not connected, mediocre hand)\n- Stack: 143 chips (8.9 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 8 chips (half of current bet)\n- Min raise: 32 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent actions from seat 2 (Kimi-K2 in BB):\n- Has been active, making raises (48 chips) and calls\n- Has shown down some strong hands: AA, TT, 66 (set), QcAd\n- Seems to defend BB with decent hands\n- In hand 67, called 177 preflop (big call) with 66 and won with a set\n- In hand 71, raised to 48, then called 32 more (so someone 3-bet)\n\n**My Situation:**\n- 8.9 BB is a short stack in tournament poker\n- Q7o is a very weak hand, even on the button\n- I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (call 8 to win 24)\n- However, with a short stack, I need to be selective\n- If I call, I'll have 135 chips left (8.4 BB)\n- If I raise to 32, I'd have 111 left (6.9 BB)\n- If I raise and get called/raised, I'm likely dominated\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- With <10 BB, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold\n- Q7o is not a shoving hand, even on the button\n- The opponent in BB seems competent and defends with real hands\n- I should preserve my stack for better spots\n\n**Decision:**\nFold. Q7o is too weak to play even with good position when I'm this short stacked. I need to wait for a better hand or situation. The opponent has shown they defend their BB with legitimate hands, so I can't steal profitably here. Preserve the 8.9 BB for a better spot.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I'm on the BUTTON with 8.9 BB. Maybe I should raise to steal? Let me think about this more carefully.\n\nActually, with Q7o and a short stack, even on the button, this is a fold. The hand has poor equity against typical BB defend ranges. If I raise to 32 (min raise), I'm committing ~22% of my stack with a weak hand. If I get called, I'm out of position postflop (actually I'd be in position, but with a weak hand and shallow stacks). \n\nBetter to fold and wait for a hand I can shove with or a better stealing hand. Q7o is just too weak.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: K4o (King of diamonds, 4 of spades) - This is a weak hand, offsuit with a weak kicker\n2. **My position**: Button (BTN) - good position\n3. **My stack**: 127 chips (7.9 BB) - very short stacked\n4. **Blinds**: 8/16\n5. **Current situation**: \n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB) posted 8\n   - I posted BB 16\n   - MiniMax-M2 called 8 more (since they posted 8 and need to call 8 more to match my BB)\n   - It's now my action with 0 to call (I can check or raise)\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n   - Very frequent folder preflop (folded in hands 61, 63, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73, 74)\n   - When they do play, they can be aggressive (bet 40 on flop in hand 60, bet 80 on turn in hand 65, bet 48 on flop in hand 72)\n   - They've called preflop a few times (hands 65, 72)\n   - They raised preflop once (hand 62, raised to 32)\n\nGiven that I'm extremely short-stacked (7.9 BB), I need to be looking for spots to get my chips in. I have position and a decent hand (K4o is not great but has some value). \n\nThe pot is currently 32 chips (my BB 16 + their SB 8 + their call 8). If I check, we'll see a flop and I'll still have 127 chips left.\n\nHowever, with a short stack like this, I should consider raising to try to take the pot down now or set up a favorable situation. A standard raise would be to 32 (minimum) or perhaps 48.\n\nBut wait - let me reconsider. K4o is a very weak hand. Even though I'm short-stacked, I should be selective. The fact that MiniMax-M2 called rather than folded suggests they might have something. They've been folding most hands but when they do play, they can be aggressive.\n\nWith 7.9 BB, I could:\n1. Check and see a flop (preserve chips)\n2. Raise to try to take it down now (risky with weak hand)\n3. Fold (but I have 0 to call, so folding is free but gives up any chance)\n\nGiven my extreme short stack, I should actually be more aggressive preflop with any decent hand. K4o is marginal but on the button with a short stack, I could consider a raise. However, I need to be careful - if I raise and get called, I'm committed.\n\nActually, let me reconsider more carefully. With 7.9 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. The standard play would be to either go all-in or fold. But since I have the option to check for free, I should take it with this weak hand. K4o is not strong enough to commit my stack with.\n\nThe pot is 32 and I have 127. If I check, I'm getting a free look at the flop. If I hit a King, I might have the best hand. If I don't, I can fold easily.\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 has been folding most hands preflop but called this one, they might have some marginal hand. But I don't have enough information to risk my tournament life with K4o.\n\nI think the best play is to check and see the flop. It's free and gives me a chance to hit something.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN (Button) with 9c 5d\n- Stack: 151 chips (9.4 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Amount to call: 8 (completing my small blind)\n- Minimum raise: 32\n- Only opponent: Kimi-K2 in BB with 673 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n9c 5d is a very weak hand, not connected, not suited, low cards. This is a fold in almost all situations.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at Kimi-K2's recent actions:\n- Very tight preflop: folded 8 out of 11 recent preflop opportunities (hands 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 69, 70, 72, 75)\n- When they do raise preflop, they show up with strong hands: AA (hand 68), 66 (hand 67), QQ (hand 71)\n- They 3-bet with strong hands and call raises with medium pairs\n- Showdowns reveal they play premium hands: AA, TT, 66\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 9.4 BB, which is a short stack\n- I'm on the button, which is good position\n- I need to be selective with hands when short-stacked\n- 9c 5d is not a good hand to risk chips with, even from button\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- I need to call 8 to win 24 (3:1 pot odds)\n- But with such a weak hand, even good pot odds don't justify calling\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 9c 5d is trash, especially for a short stack. Even though I'm getting decent pot odds and have position, this hand has very little equity against any reasonable BB defending range. I should preserve my chips for a better spot.\n\nThe opponent is tight and will likely defend their BB with decent hands. Even if I hit a 9 or 5, I'll often be dominated. The only way I'd consider playing this is if the opponent was extremely tight and I could steal, but calling 8 chips with this hand is just throwing chips away.",

It's not suited, not connected, and the 5 is very low. Even in position, this hand has very little equity against any reasonable range.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nWith 9.4 BB, I'm in the short stack category but not yet in push/fold mode (typically <10 BB is push/fold, but I have a little wiggle room). However, I need to be selective with my hands.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- SB (big stack) is aggressive, raises frequently\n- BB (short stack) folds a lot preflop, but defends sometimes\n\n**Decision:**\nWith Q5o on the button facing a 16 chip call (1 BB), I should fold. The hand is too weak, and even though I'm in position, I don't want to invest 10.6% of my stack on such a weak holding. I need to preserve my chips for better spots, especially given that the SB is aggressive and I could easily face a raise.\n\nIf I call 16, I'd be investing over 10% of my stack on Q5o which will rarely hit strong enough to continue. \n\nI should fold and wait for a better hand or situation.",

It's not a strong starting hand, especially from the BB.\n\n2. **My position**: BB (out of position for the rest of the hand)\n\n3. **My stack**: 135 chips (8.4 BB) - I'm short-stacked but not desperate yet.\n\n4. **The action**:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB) posted 8\n   - I posted BB 16\n   - Kimi-K2 raised to 48\n   - MiniMax-M2 then re-raised to 100\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 84 to win 164 (already in pot), so about 2:1 pot odds.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Kimi-K2: Shows a pattern of raising to 48 in many hands (68, 71, 74, 77, and this hand). This seems like a standard raise size for them. They fold sometimes too.\n   - MiniMax-M2: Usually folds preflop (hands 71, 73, 74, 76, 77), but has called twice (hands 72, 75). The call in hand 72 was followed by a 48-chip bet on the flop.\n\n7. **Current situation**: MiniMax-M2 is making a big re-raise from the SB to 100. They only have 8 chips total, so this is effectively an all-in. This suggests they have a strong hand.\n\n8. **Hand strength**: K3o is a very weak hand. Even with the pot odds, I'm likely dominated by any King they have (better kicker) or any pair.\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: With 8.4 BB, I need to be selective. Calling 84 chips would leave me with only 51 chips if I lose. That's a huge chunk of my stack for a very marginal hand.\n\n10. **Decision**: This is a clear fold. K3o is too weak to call against a re-raise from a player who usually folds preflop. The re-raise to 100 from MiniMax-M2 (who only has 8 chips total) suggests they have a very strong hand. Even though I'm getting 2:1 pot odds, my hand equity is likely much worse than that against their range.\n\nI should fold and preserve my 8.4 BB stack for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 2s Td - This is a very weak hand (T2 offsuit). This is a fold in almost all situations.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - This is good position, but my hand is too weak to play.\n\n3. **My stack**: 127 chips (7.9 BB) - I'm in a critical situation with less than 8 big blinds. This is short-stack territory where I need to be selective about which hands I play.\n\n4. **Opponent action**: Seat 2 raised to 48 (3x the BB). Looking at the opponent history:\n   - They seem to raise frequently from SB position\n   - Recent raises: 48 in hands 74, 77, 78 (all preflop)\n   - They showed down some decent hands: TT, 66, AA, AQ, Q6\n   - They seem to be playing fairly aggressively\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 48 to win 64 (pot) + 48 (my call) = 112 chips. So 48/112 = ~43% equity needed. With T2 offsuit, I definitely don't have this equity against a raising range.\n\n6. **Tournament situation**: With only 7.9 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. T2 offsuit is not a hand I want to risk 38% of my stack on (48/127 = 38%).\n\n7. **Position advantage**: Even though I'm on the button, this hand is just too weak. I should wait for a better spot or at least a hand with some showdown value.\n\nThe only consideration is that with less than 10 BB, I could consider shoving as a steal if the opponent folds frequently. However, looking at their history, they raise quite often and have shown down decent hands. They don't seem to be folding much preflop.\n\nGiven:\n- Very weak hand (T2 offsuit)\n- Facing a raise (not just stealing blinds)\n- Short stack that needs preservation\n- Opponent shows aggression and doesn't fold often\n\nThis is a clear fold. I need to wait for a better hand or situation.",

This raise to 96 is much larger than their typical raises (double the usual size), which suggests significant strength.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is currently 144 chips\n   - I need to call 64 chips\n   - Pot odds: 144:64 or about 2.25:1\n   - This means I need ~31% equity to call\n\n7. **Hand equity**: With Q9o against a typical raising range, I likely have much less than 31% equity. Against a strong range (AA-22, AK-AT, KQ, etc.), Q9o has around 25-30% equity at best.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: With only 3 BB left, I need to be very selective. While I'm getting decent pot odds, Q9o is just too weak to risk my tournament life on, especially against what appears to be a very strong raise from Kimi-K2.\n\nThe decision should be to fold. I don't have a strong enough hand to justify calling off 2/3 of my remaining stack, and the opponent's unusually large raise suggests they have a premium hand.",

It's offsuit, low cards, no connectivity, and no high card value.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - This is good position, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n3. **My stack**: 79 chips (2.5 BB) - This is a very short stack. I'm in a critical tournament situation where I need to preserve my chips for better opportunities or go all-in with a decent hand.\n\n4. **Pot**: 48 chips\n   - SB: 16 (me)\n   - BB: 32 (Kimi-K2)\n   - Folded: MiniMax-M2\n\n5. **Action**: I need to call 16 more chips (I'm in for 16 already as SB).\n\n6. **Pot odds**: If I call 16, the pot will be 64 chips. So I'm risking 16 to win 64, which is 4:1 pot odds. But with 7-2 offsuit, even these odds aren't good enough.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With only 2.5 BB left, I need to be extremely selective. 7-2 offsuit is definitely not a hand to risk my tournament life on. I should fold and wait for a better spot, even though I'll be down to 63 chips (less than 2 BB).\n\n8. **Opponent**: The BB is Kimi-K2 with a big stack (821 chips). They could call any raise I make easily.\n\n9. **Legal actions**: fold, call, raise (minimum raise to 64)\n\nThe correct play here is to fold. 7-2 offsuit is a trash hand, and with my short stack, I need to preserve chips for better opportunities. Even though I'll be left with less than 2 BB, it's better to wait for a hand with some equity rather than gamble with 7-2.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold situation based on hand strength and stack size.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation again:\n\n- I have 4s 4h (pocket 4s)\n- I'm on the button (BTN)\n- My stack is 79 chips (listed as 2.5 BB)\n- Blinds are 16/32\n- Pot is 32 chips\n- Amount to call is 16\n- Minimum raise to 48\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nWait, the amount to call is 16, not 32. This means the action is:\n- SB posted 16\n- BB posted 16 (but should be 32 if blinds are 16/32?)\n- SB checked\n\nIf the BB is 16, then my stack is 79/16 = 4.9 BB, not 2.5 BB. But the description says \"2.5 BB\".\n\nLet me think about the actual situation. If blinds are 16/32:\n- SB should be 16\n- BB should be 32\n- But it says BB posted 16\n\nThis is confusing. Let me work with what's given:\n- I need to call 16 to see the flop\n- I have 79 chips total\n- This is about 5x the amount to call\n\nWith pocket 4s on the button, facing just a check from SB (no raise), I should definitely see the flop here. The call is only 16 chips from my 79 chip stack, giving me a chance to hit a set.\n\nPot odds: 32 in pot, 16 to call = 2:1 pot odds. But with a pocket pair, I'm looking to hit a set (about 7.5:1 against). However, with such a short stack, I don't need direct pot odds - I just need to preserve my stack while getting a cheap look at the flop.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider the stack size. It says \"79 chips (2.5 BB)\". If 2.5 BB = 79, then BB = 31.6, which is roughly 32. So blinds are 16/32, and my stack is about 2.5 BB.\n\n\nMy tournament life is at stake with this short stack. A standard raise would be 2.5x BB at 80 chips, which essentially puts me all-in. \n\nI see two strategic options:\n1. Go all-in preflop with pocket 4s\n2. Call the 16 and hope for a favorable flop\n\nThe all-in move would be around 2.5x BB, which might not generate enough fold equity. I'm in a critical position where every chip matters, and my pocket pair gives me a potential shot at doubling up.\n\nWith only 2.5 BB remaining, my options are extremely limited. The preflop check from the small blind suggests I might have some fold equity, but it's not guaranteed. My best move is to shove all-in and hope for a fold or a favorable showdown.\n\nThe key is maximizing my chances of survival with this marginal hand and critically low stack. An all-in push gives me the highest probability of either stealing the blinds or getting a chance to double up.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 8c 3s is an extremely weak hand - offsuit, low cards, no connectivity. This is a trash hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (Button), which is the best position post-flop, but with this hand it doesn't matter much.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have only 47 chips (1.5 BB), which is extremely short-stacked. I'm in critical tournament survival mode.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 48 chips, and I need to call 16 chips. That's 3:1 pot odds. However, with 8-3 offsuit, my equity is terrible against any reasonable range.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the opponent data:\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been active with various actions: raises, calls, checks, folds\n   - They've shown down some decent hands (AA, AK, 66, etc.)\n   - They seem to be a solid player with a large stack (853 chips)\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With only 1.5 BB left, I'm in desperation mode. However, 8-3 offsuit is one of the worst hands in poker. Even if I shove all-in (47 chips), I'm likely dominated by any hand that calls.\n\n7. **The play**: I posted the SB (16 chips), so I need to put in 16 more to call the BB. If I call, I'll have 31 chips left (less than 1 BB), which makes me even more committed on the flop. \n\nThe correct play here is to **fold**. Even though I'm extremely short-stacked, 8-3 offsuit has such poor equity that it's not worth the investment. I should wait for a better spot - even any face card or pocket pair would be better. The 3:1 pot odds don't compensate for the terrible hand strength.\n\nI cannot raise because it's not in my legal actions, and even if I could, going all-in with 8-3 offsuit would be a poor decision against a player who can easily call with any reasonable hand.\n \nFolding is the wisest move to preserve my minimal tournament life for a more favorable opportunity.",

Let me recalculate:\n- Blinds are 16/32, meaning SB is 16, BB is 32\n- I posted BB of 32, but my stack is only 15 chips? That doesn't make sense.\n- Actually, looking more carefully: \"Your Stack: 15 chips (0.5 BB)\" and \"Blinds: 16/32\"\n- If BB is 32 chips, and I have 15 chips, that's less than 0.5 BB (15/32 = 0.47)\n- The pot is 96 chips: 16 (SB) + 32 (BB) + 64 (raise) = 112, but it says 96... hmm\n\nLet me think about the actual situation:\n- I have 15 chips total\n- I already posted BB of 32, but I only have 15 chips? This means I must have been all-in for the BB\n- Seat 2 raised to 64\n- Amount to call is listed as 32\n\nActually, I think the \"15 chips (0.5 BB)\" means I have 15 big blinds, not 15 chips. Let me reconsider:\n- If I have 15 BB and blinds are 16/32, that would be 15 * 32 = 480 chips\n- But it says \"15 chips\" not \"15 BB\"\n\nI think there's confusion in the notation. Let me look at what's clear:\n- My cards: 2c 5c - This is a very weak hand\n- I'm in BB position\n- One opponent (Seat 2) has raised\n- I can fold or call\n\nWith 2c 5c, this is one of the worst starting hands in poker. I'm out of position against a raiser. Even if I'm short stacked, this is a clear fold. The only reason to consider calling would be if I'm getting incredible pot odds and I'm already all-in or nearly all-in.\n\nGiven that I have to call 32 chips, and the pot is 96, I'm getting 3:1 pot odds. But with 2-5 offsuit (even suited), I have very poor equity against any reasonable raising range. \n\nLet me make a decision: I should fold this hand. It's too weak to continue with.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Th 3h - This is a very weak hand, even though it's suited. T3 is not a playable hand in most situations.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (button) - This is the best position, but it doesn't matter much with this hand.\n\n3. **My stack**: 14 chips (0.4 BB) - This is extremely short! I'm in a desperate situation with less than half a big blind.\n\n4. **Blinds**: 16/32 - The big blind is 32 chips, but I only have 14 chips total.\n\n5. **Pot**: 48 chips (16 from SB + 32 from BB)\n\n6. **Amount to call**: 16 - Since I posted the small blind of 16, I need to put in 16 more chips to call.\n\n7. **Legal actions**: fold or call (can't raise because the minimum raise to 64 is more than my stack)\n\nGiven that I only have 14 chips total and the big blind is 32, I'm already all-in for less than the big blind. I've posted 16 chips as the small blind, leaving me with -2 chips (which doesn't make sense mathematically, but the system shows I have 14 chips remaining after posting SB).\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n- I posted SB of 16 chips\n- I have 14 chips remaining\n- That means I started with 30 chips\n- BB is 32 chips\n- To call, I would need to match the BB of 32, but I only have 14 chips left\n\nSo the \"amount to call: 16\" means I need to put in 16 more chips to complete my call, and I'll be all-in.\n\nWith Th 3h:\n- This is a terrible hand\n- I'm extremely short stacked (0.4 BB)\n- I have pot odds of (48 + 16) / 16 = 4 to 1\n- I need roughly 25% equity to break even on this call\n\nLet me think about tournament equity:\n- With 0.4 BB, I'm in a desperate spot\n\n\n- I need to take almost any opportunity to double up\n- The suited hand offers a slim chance of improvement\n- Calling is essentially a last-ditch effort to survive\n\nIn this critical tournament moment, the marginal pot odds and desperate stack size make calling the most logical, albeit risky, move. The suited cards provide just enough potential to justify the all-in call.\n\nI'll make a stand and call, hoping to catch a favorable flop and potentially double my meager stack.",

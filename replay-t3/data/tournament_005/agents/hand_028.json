            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n**My Hand:** 7h 5s (offsuit, low cards)\n**Position:** UTG (earliest position, worst position)\n**Stack:** 243 chips (60.8 BB) - healthy stack\n**Blinds:** 2/4\n**Pot:** 6 chips\n**Amount to call:** 4 chips\n\nFrom the opponent actions I just recalled:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been quite active, raising preflop in hand 25 and betting postflop\n- Generally tight play from most opponents, lots of folding\n- In hand 27, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 preflop\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 7-5 offsuit is a very weak hand, especially from UTG position. This is a clear fold in almost all situations.\n\n2. **Position:** UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act on all postflop streets with 4 players still to act behind me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** The table seems relatively tight based on the folding patterns, but Seat 5 has shown aggression. This makes playing a weak hand even more dangerous.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations:** With 60+ BB, I have a healthy stack. No need to risk chips with such a weak hand from bad position. Preserving my stack for better spots is key.\n\n5. **Pot odds:** 4 chips to win 6 chips = 1.5:1 pot odds, which is not nearly enough to justify playing this hand.\n\n**Decision:** Clear fold. This is a textbook fold situation - weak hand, bad position, healthy stack size where preservation matters more than accumulation with marginal spots.",

MiniMax-M2 (SB): Seems fairly tight - folded A6o in SB to a raise in hand 27, folded to my raise in hand 23\n2. GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has shown some aggression - raised to 12 from UTG in hand 25, called my raise in hand 23 but folded to flop bet\n\n**Position advantage:** Being on BTN gives us positional advantage throughout the hand.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Conservative play with marginal hand\n2. **Call:** See flop cheaply with position\n3. **Raise:** Steal blinds with button raise\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 48BB, we have room to be selective but also need to accumulate chips. Button steals are important in tournament poker.\n\n**Decision:** I think a small raise is appropriate here. A6o is playable from the button for a steal attempt. If either blind calls, we have position and can outplay them postflop. A raise to 8-12 chips (2-3x BB) seems reasonable.\n\nGiven the minimum raise is to 8, I'll raise to 12 (3x BB), which is a standard button raise size. This puts pressure on the blinds and gives us initiative."

MiniMax-M2 (SB): Seems fairly tight - folded A6o in SB to a raise in hand 27, folded to my raise in hand 23\n2. GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has shown some aggression - raised to 12 from UTG in hand 25, called my raise in hand 23 but folded to flop bet\n\n**Position advantage:** Being on BTN gives us positional advantage throughout the hand.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Conservative play with marginal hand\n2. **Call:** See flop cheaply with position\n3. **Raise:** Steal blinds with button raise\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 48BB, we have room to be selective but also need to accumulate chips. Button steals are important in tournament poker.\n\n**Decision:** I think a small raise is appropriate here. A6o is playable from the button for a steal attempt. If either blind calls, we have position and can outplay them postflop. A raise to 8-12 chips (2-3x BB) seems reasonable.\n\nGiven the minimum raise is to 8, I'll raise to 12 (3x BB), which is a standard button raise size.

            "reasoning_content": "  The opponent in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has made a raise to 4 chips. Let me analyze their pattern:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)\n- They raised to 4 in hand #4 as well\n- In hand #3 they went to showdown with 2s 5s (a very weak offsuit hand)\n- Their raise size is consistent at 4 chips (2x the big blind)\n\nThis suggests they might be playing somewhat loose/weak. The raise to 4 could be:\n1. A standard opening with a decent hand\n2. A steal attempt \n3. A weak hand trying to see a flop cheaply\n\nMy hand Qs Jd is a decent hand in CO position:\n- Suited queen is good\n- Can make strong top pairs, straights, flushes\n- I'm 94 BB deep which is comfortable\n- There's only one player behind me (Seat 2)\n\nThe pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 7 (SB+BB+raise), so about 1.75:1 or 36% equity needed. QJs definitely has that against a typical raising range.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and the opponent's tendency to fold a lot preflop, I should either:\n1. Call and see a flop in position\n2. Raise to isolate and potentially take it down preflop\n\nA raise would be good because:\n- I have position post-flop\n- The opponent folds a lot, so I might win immediately\n- If they call, I have a strong hand that plays well post-flop\n- I can control the pot size\n\nLet me make a standard raise to about 12-14 chips (3x their raise). That would be to 14-16 total, but minimum raise is 6. I think 12-14 is good.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With QJs in the CO facing a min-raise from a loose player who folds a lot, I should be aggressive. I'll raise to 12 chips total (3x their raise).",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand details:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- Cards: Qs Jd (offsuit)\n- Stack: 176 chips (88 BB)\n- Board: 2c Kd 9h\n- Pot: 27 chips\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5)\n\n**Preflop action:**\n- Seat 5 raised to 4\n- I 3-bet to 12\n- Seat 5 called 8\n\n**Flop action:**\n- Seat 5 checked\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Minimum raise: 8\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have QJ offsuit\n- Board: 2c Kd 9h\n- I missed the flop completely - no pair, no straight draw, no flush draw\n- Only backdoor straight possibilities (need 10 then K, or 10 then 8, etc.)\n\n**Opponent tendencies (from recall):**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's actions:\n- Very tight preflop: folded 7 hands in a row (hands 5-11)\n- Only played hand #4 preflop with a raise\n- In hand #3, they checked turn and river\n- They called my 3-bet preflop, which suggests some strength\n\n**Opponent's likely range:**\nGiven they called my 3-bet after being tight, they likely have:\n- Pocket pairs: 99-QQ, possibly KK/AA\n- Big Broadway cards: AQ, AJ, KQ\n- Maybe some suited connectors\n\n**Board texture:**\n- Dry board with K-9-2 rainbow\n- King is high card\n- Not many draws possible\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak - just Q-high\n2. **Position**: I'm in position (on the button), which is good\n3. **Opponent's action**: They checked to me - could be weak or trapping\n4. **Pot size**: 27 chips, which is about 15% of my stack\n5. **Continuation bet**: Standard play would be to c-bet here since I was the aggressor preflop\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: Take a free card, see if I improve on turn. I have 6 outs to a pair (3 Qs, 3 Js), plus backdoor draws.\n- **Bet**: Standard c-bet to represent the King and try to take down the pot. Bet sizing would be around 13-18 chips (half pot to 2/3 pot).\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (88 BB)\n- This is a small pot relative to my stack\n- Taking down 27 chips would be a nice win\n\n**Opponent's check:**\nCould mean:\n1. They missed the flop completely and are giving up\n2. They have a medium-strength hand and want to pot control\n3. They're trapping with a monster (KK, 99, 22, AK)\n\nGiven their tight nature, if they had a monster like a set or top two, they might be more likely to bet for value. The check suggests weakness more often than not.\n\n**My decision:**\nI should make a continuation bet here. As the preflop aggressor, betting the flop is standard and represents strength. Even though I missed, the opponent's check suggests weakness, and I can take down this pot a good percentage of the time.\n\nBet sizing: About 14-16 chips (slightly over half pot) seems appropriate. This puts pressure on opponent without risking too much of my stack.\n\nMinimum raise is 8, but that seems too small for a c-bet. I should bet around 14-16.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the raise_to value. The minimum raise to is 8, which means total bet of 8. But that's only 8 chips into a 27 chip pot - too small. \n\nWait, I need to understand the betting structure better. The \"minimum raise to\" means the smallest TOTAL amount I can put in if I raise. So if I raise to 8, I'm betting 8 chips total (not adding 8 to something).\n\nFor a proper c-bet, I should bet around 14-18 chips. Let me bet 16, which is about 60% of pot - a standard c-bet size.\n\nFinal decision: Raise to 16 (bet 16 chips).",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ah Qc - AQo is a strong hand, especially from the SB position. It's a premium hand but not quite AA, KK, QQ, AK.\n\n2. **Current action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 4, then Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) 3-bet to 12. I need to call 11 chips.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm in SB (worst position), which makes playing this hand more difficult postflop since I'll be out of position against both players.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - My stack: 206 chips (103 BB)\n   - Seat 1: 176 chips\n   - Seat 4 (BB yet to act): 198 chips\n   - Seat 5: 193 chips\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 19 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 4 raise + 12 3-bet). I need to call 11 to win 30, giving me pot odds of about 1:2.7 (27% equity needed). AQo against a 3-betting range likely has around 30-40% equity depending on opponent's range.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot preflop, but just raised to 6 in hand 11. This 3-bet to 12 suggests a strong hand.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been folding a lot preflop, showed 2s5s in one showdown. The initial raise to 4 could be a wider range.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (103 BB). Being in the SB with AQo facing a 3-bet is tricky. Folding preserves my stack. Calling puts me in a difficult spot postflop out of position. 4-betting could be an option but risks a lot of chips.\n\n8. **Additional factors**: The BB (Seat 4) still has to act behind me, which adds more complexity. If I call, the BB might squeeze or call as well.\n\nGiven the position disadvantage and the strength of the 3-bet (especially from an opponent who has been folding frequently), I think the prudent play is to fold. AQo doesn't play well multi-way out of position against what appears to be a strong 3-betting range. The pot odds are decent but not great given the positional disadvantage.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot with position.",

Seat1 is UTG? The seats: Seat1 is likely UTG (since seat5 is BB). So 3-bet from UTG. We have ATo. How to play? Consider opponent's 3-bet range: likely strong (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK, maybe AQ, maybe AJs, maybe KQs). ATo is a decent but maybe marginal. With deep stack, could consider 4-bet or call. 4-bet size? Minimum raise to 20 (so raise to at least 20). That would be 20 total, meaning additional 12 beyond call. That is a 2.5x raise over 3-bet (12). Could be a strong move. But we need to consider stack sizes: Kimi-K2 has 176 chips (approx 88 BB). We have 193 chips (96 BB). So we could 4-bet all-in? All-in would be 193 (but min raise to 20). All-in is huge. Might be too risky. Could call and see flop, but we are out of position (we are still in BB after 3-bet, but we will be out of position preflop? Actually after 3-bet, we are in the big blind, but we are the only caller if we call, we will be out of position postflop vs Kimi in UTG (first to act). So calling is okay if we think we have equity vs his range. ATo vs typical 3-bet range: equity maybe around 45% vs a tight range. Might be okay to call.\n\nBut also we could 4-bet as a bluff or for value. Our hand is not a top 3-bet hand. So likely call is best.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nCheck legal: call is allowed.

So pot after preflop: blinds 1+2=3, plus our raise 4 (additional 2 beyond BB?), actually we posted 2 then raised to 4 (so extra 2). Then 3-bet 12, we call 8. So total contributions: SB 1, BB 12 (2+4+6? Wait we posted 2, then raise to 4 (extra 2), then call 8 more = total 12). Seat1 contributed 12. So pot = 1+12+12 = 25? But given pot is 27 (maybe includes some other). Anyway.\n\nNow flop: 2c Kd 9h. Board: 2c, Kd, 9h. Our hand: Ace of diamonds, Ten of spades. So we have Ace high, Ten high. No pair, no draw. Opponent (Seat1) presumably has a range: 3-bet from BB after we raised. Could be strong: AK, AQ, AA, KK, maybe suited connectors, etc. But board is Kd, so they could have Kx (top pair). Our hand is weak. Stack sizes: we have 185 chips, opponent 176 chips. Pot 27. Opponent's action? Not given yet; we need to decide our action. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call is 0 (so it's our turn after opponent? Actually we are in BB, after preflop we called, flop is now. Likely opponent (Seat1) acted first (since they are in UTG? Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, probably under the gun? But position: seat1 is left of SB? Table order: seat1 is maybe UTG? But we are BB, so after flop, action starts with first active player left of button? Since button not given; but we are BB, seat1 is maybe UTG or maybe button? Not sure. But amount to call 0 indicates no bet yet. So we can check or raise. Considering our hand is weak, we likely check. Could also consider a bluff raise? But with only 92.5 BB stack, and opponent similar stack, maybe not advisable. Also opponent may have Kx. So best is check.\n\nThus action: check.

Our stack 185, pot after bet will be 43+16=59 (if we call). We need to consider hand strength: we have Ace high with a Ten. No pair, no draw. Potential: Overcards Ace and Ten. Board: K,9,2. Opponent could have Kx, 9x, A? Actually Ace is overcard; Ten could give straight draw? Board: 2-9-K, Ten not connecting. Straight possibilities: 8-7-6-5-4 etc not relevant. So we have only Ace high, maybe a gutshot? No. So likely losing. Opponent's bet size 16 is about 1/3 pot. Could be continuation bet from preflop raise 12 (they raised to 12 after our raise to 4). Preflop action: we raised to 4 (from BB), they 3-bet to 12, we called. So they are the aggressor preflop, likely have a range of strong hands: broadways, AK, AQ, AJ, KQ, maybe suited connectors, pairs. On flop K9-2, they bet 16 (c-bet). Our hand Ace Ten is weak. Should we fold? Yes, likely fold. However consider stack depth: 185 chips, we have 92.5 BB, not short. Fold is safe.\n\nCheck if any opponent tendencies: We have limited data. Use recall_opponent_actions for flop bets. Already attempted but no data. So we assume typical.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

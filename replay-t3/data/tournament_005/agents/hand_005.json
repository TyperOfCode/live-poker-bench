            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand**: 3s Qh (Queen high, offsuit, with a low kicker)\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Best position postflop\n**Stack**: 197 chips (98.5 BB) - Very healthy stack\n**Pot**: 3 chips\n**To call**: 1 chip (half a big blind)\n\n**Opponent info**: Kimi-K2 has folded in 3 out of 4 hands preflop, raised once to 6 chips. Sample is small but suggests they might be somewhat tight.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Q3 offsuit is a very weak hand. Even though I have a Queen, the 3 kicker is terrible. This hand is in the bottom 20% of starting hands.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is great, but that matters more postflop. Preflop, position helps but doesn't make up for a terrible hand.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 1 to win 3, so 3:1 pot odds. This is attractive, but with Q3o, even these odds don't justify calling. I need roughly 25% equity to break even, and Q3o against a random hand has about 45% equity, BUT...\n\n4. **Opponent's range**: The BB (Kimi-K2) has shown some tightness. When they defend their BB, they'll likely have better hands than Q3o. Against a reasonable defending range, Q3o has terrible equity.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 98.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. There's no need to get involved with marginal situations. Preserving my stack and waiting for better spots is the correct tournament strategy.\n\n6. **Postflop playability**: Q3o has terrible playability. If I hit a Queen, I'll be dominated by better kickers. If I hit a 3, it's rarely good. The hand is not suited, so no flush potential.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. The tiny investment of 1 chip might seem insignificant, but it's -EV in the long run. Tournament poker is about preserving chips for good spots, not getting involved with trash hands even when getting good pot odds.\n\nI'll fold and wait for a better hand/situation.",

The blinds are 1/2.\n\nA3o is a marginal hand. The ace is nice but with a weak kicker (3), this hand has reverse implied odds - if I hit an ace, I might be dominated by better aces. Also, being suited would be better, but it's offsuit.\n\nFrom UTG, standard opening ranges are tight. A3o is definitely not in a standard UTG opening range. I should be folding most hands from UTG and only opening with premium hands.\n\nConsidering I have 100BB (200 chips), I don't want to get involved with a weak hand from early position. Folding is the correct play.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've folded my last 3 hands preflop, which shows discipline. That's good.\n\nThe pot is only 3 chips, so not much to fight for. Better to wait for a better spot.\n\nDecision: Fold."

UTG is the toughest position to play from because I have to act first and there are many players left to act behind me.\n\nLooking at the opponent actions I recalled:\n- Hand #2: Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raised to 6 from the BB\n- Hand #4: GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) raised to 4 from some position\n\nWe're in a 5-handed game with 100BB stacks (200 chips). The blinds are 1/2.\n\nA3o is a marginal hand. The ace is nice but with a weak kicker (3), this hand has reverse implied odds - if I hit an ace, I might be dominated by better aces. Also, being suited would be better, but it's offsuit.\n\nFrom UTG, standard opening ranges are tight. A3o is definitely not in a standard UTG opening range. I should be folding most hands from UTG and only opening with premium hands.\n\nConsidering I have 100BB (200 chips), I don't want to get involved with a weak hand from early position. Folding is the correct play.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've folded my last 3 hands preflop, which shows discipline. That's good.\n\nThe pot is only 3 chips, so not much to fight for. Better to wait for a better spot.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to total 4). Need decide.\n\nHand 6d8h is a weak suited? Actually unsuited: 6d 8h, off-suit. Not a premium hand. On button, can consider stealing blind, but 6-8 offsuit is not a good steal candidate, but can be okay in some games. Opponents: Seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is SB with 197 chips; Seat2 (Kimi-K2) is BB with 200 chips. Both likely similar. We have no recall info. Could raise to apply pressure, but risk being called and playing postflop with weak hand.\n\nGiven tournament early stage, 100 BB, we may want to preserve chips. 6-8 off-suit is not a hand to call blind. So folding is standard. Could raise to 4 (2x BB) maybe to steal, but risk. Usually button raise range includes many connectors, but 6-8 off-suit is borderline. Many players raise with any two cards on button. But given we have no info, I'd fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

They limped once and folded on flop. They seem straightforward and not overly aggressive postflop.\n\n**Hand strength**: K8o is a marginal hand, especially from SB. It's dominated by many hands (any K with better kicker, any pair). \n\n**Position**: SB is terrible postflop - I'll be first to act on every street.\n\n**Pot odds**: I'm getting 5:1 to call (call 2 to win 10), which is attractive, but I need to consider reverse implied odds - when I hit my King, I could lose a lot if opponent has a better kicker.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 59 BB, I have a comfortable stack. I don't need to take marginal spots. The opponent seems straightforward and likely has a hand they're willing to play given they called from CO.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. K8o is too weak from SB, especially with position disadvantage and risk of being dominated. Even with good pot odds, the reverse implied odds and postflop playability make this a losing play long-term.",

Let me think through this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 4h 8s is one of the worst possible starting hands in poker. It's offsuit, low cards, no connectivity. It has virtually no playability, especially from UTG.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position to play marginal hands from, as I have to act first post-flop with 4 players left to act behind me.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 199 chips (49.8 BB) is healthy, but not so deep that I can afford to play speculative hands from bad position.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (7 of last 8 hands folded preflop)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Also folding frequently, but did call once with T6s\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression with raises and bets post-flop\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop multiple times, seems active\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack, I should preserve it for better spots. Playing 84o from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I'd need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. However, with such a weak hand, I'm unlikely to win unless I hit a miracle flop, and even then I could be dominated.\n\nGiven all this analysis, this is an easy fold. I should wait for a better spot with position or a stronger hand.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been playing too tight or loose."

Let me think through this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 4h 8s is one of the worst possible starting hands in poker. It's offsuit, low cards, no connectivity. It has virtually no playability, especially from UTG.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position to play marginal hands from, as I have to act first post-flop with 4 players left to act behind me.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 199 chips (49.8 BB) is healthy, but not so deep that I can afford to play speculative hands from bad position.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (7 of last 8 hands folded preflop)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Also folding frequently, but did call once with T6s\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression with raises and bets post-flop\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop multiple times, seems active\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack, I should preserve it for better spots. Playing 84o from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I'd need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. However, with such a weak hand, I'm unlikely to win unless I hit a miracle flop, and even then I could be dominated.\n\nGiven all this analysis, this is an easy fold. I should wait for a better spot with position or a stronger hand.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been playing too tight or loose.",

This suggests I need to be extremely cautious with my weak Kd 9h hand.\n\n6. **Current situation**: \n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has folded\n   - I need to call 4 chips to stay in the hand\n   - Minimum raise would be to 8 chips total\n\n7. **Decision factors**:\n   - Kd 9h is a weak hand from UTG\n   - Multiple aggressive opponents left to act\n   - Poor position with no information\n   - Low win rate from UTG (11.8%)\n   - Most of my UTG hands have been folded\n   \nFolding appears to be the most prudent strategy.

            "reasoning_content": "We need decide action. Hand QTs suited (Queens Ten suited). Position BTN, stacks 154, blinds 2/4, effective stack 154 (38.5 BB). Opponents: seat1 SB 2 chips (tiny stack?), seat2 BB 4 chips (tiny). Actually they have small stacks (2 and 4 chips). So they are short-stacked, likely all-in or push/fold. Minimum raise is 8, which is 2 BB. With such short stacks, we can consider raising to isolate, maybe shove.\n\nWe need consider opponent tendencies: seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking with 237 chips, seat2 Kimi-K2 212 chips. But they have only 2 and 4 chips left, meaning they are short-stacked and likely will go all-in or fold. Our raise to 8 is small relative to their stacks (they have 2 and 4). Actually they have less than 8, so they cannot call a raise to 8; they'd have to go all-in for less than that? In poker, if they have less than the raise amount, they can go all-in for their remaining chips, which is a call of the raise? Typically they'd be forced to either call the bet amount (4) or go all-in for 2 or 4. Since they are SB with 2 chips, they are already all-in? Wait they posted small blind 2, they have 2 chips total, so they are all-in for the blind. Similarly BB posted 4 and has 4 total, all-in. So they are already all-in. So the pot already includes their all-ins: SB 2, BB 4, plus our call 4 if we call, plus raise. Actually the pot is 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4). The SB is all-in for 2, BB all-in for 4. So we are facing a bet of 4 (BB). So if we call, we will match 4 and get to showdown. If we raise, we would raise to at least 8, but they cannot call more than their stack, they'd be all-in for less, but they'd be already all-in. So raising would just increase pot size with no additional opponent contributions, effectively a blind steal? Might be okay to raise to steal the blinds? Actually we are the BTN, we could raise to 8 to try to win the pot immediately; but they'd be all-in already, so they'd have no option to call raise; they'd just be out. So raising is just a bluff to win the pot without showdown. But if we raise, we risk more chips (8 total) vs calling 4. Since they are all-in, they cannot fold; they are already committed. So raising just adds chips to pot with no chance of them folding, but we could raise to isolate and maybe push them out? Actually they are already all-in, so they can't fold. So raising is just a bigger investment for no extra value; we could just call and win the pot if we have best hand at showdown, or lose if they have better hand. Since they are short stacked, they likely have a wide range of hands (any two cards). QTs suited is decent but not premium. Could consider folding if we think they have stronger range? But they are all-in for 2 and 4, they could have any hand. Our equity vs random hand: QTs suited vs random is about 57%? Actually QTs suited vs random is around 57%? Let's approximate: QTs suited vs random two cards: about 55% maybe. So calling is positive expected value.\n\nStack size: we have 154, calling 4 is negligible.\n\nThus best action: call.\n\nWe need to output JSON.",

Since we have 150, we could bet 8-10 to build pot. But need to consider tournament stage: 150 chips is 37.5 BB, medium stack. We want to grow. So raise to maybe 12 (3 BB) to charge draws. Legal raise to any amount >=4. So choose raise_to 12.\n\nCheck: we can also check, but better to bet. So action: raise 12.\n\nWe need to ensure raise_to is total amount we put in, not additional. So we are putting 12 chips total. That is 8 more than current? Actually we have already 4 in pot preflop, pot 10 includes our 4 and BB 4 and SB folded. So raising to 12 means we add 8 more chips. That's okay.\n\nThus output.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3h 7c - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected with a 4-gap. This is typically a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (Button), which is the best position post-flop. However, I have a very weak hand.\n\n3. **Stack**: I have 198 chips (99 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - SB posted 1 chip\n   - I posted BB 2 chips\n   - Everyone folded to SB (GPT-OSS-120B) who raised to 4\n   - I need to call 2 more chips to see a flop\n\n5. **Opponent info**: GPT-OSS-120B has been very passive:\n   - Folded first 2 hands preflop\n   - In hand #3, they checked all streets (preflop through river)\n   - This suggests they might be a tight/passive player\n   \n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is currently 6 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 4 raise)\n   - I need to call 2 chips\n   - Pot odds: 6:2 or 3:1\n   - With 3:1 odds, I need ~25% equity to break even\n\n7. **Hand equity**: 3-7 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. Against a typical raising range, I likely have less than 25% equity.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I have a healthy stack at 99 BB\n   - No need to take marginal spots\n   - Better to wait for better hands/positions\n\nEven though I'm getting 3:1 pot odds and I have position, 3-7 offsuit is just too weak. The opponent's raise suggests they have a real hand (though they could be making a small steal attempt from SB). With my healthy stack, I should preserve chips and wait for better spots.\n\nThe only argument for calling is the small investment (2 chips) and good position, but even then, 3-7o is rarely going to win, and I don't want to get into trouble post-flop with such a weak hand.",

Hand strength: Very weak (2c 5d)\n2. Position: Good (button) but doesn't save a terrible hand\n3. Pot odds: I need to call 2 to win 3 (pot odds aren't great)\n4. Stack preservation: Important in tournament play\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. 2c 5d is too weak to play from any position, especially when I need to invest 2 chips to see the flop. Even though I'm on the button, this hand has very little equity and potential. I should wait for a better spot.\n",

Raising to 4 (standard 2\u00d7 big blind) puts pressure on the BB, gives me initiative, and if called we have position to play a flop with a suited ace. Folding would waste the blind, and just calling leaves us out of position with a marginal hand.",

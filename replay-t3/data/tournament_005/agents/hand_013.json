It's offsuit, low cards with a big gap (3-7).\n- Position: BTN - Good position, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n- Stack: 206 chips (103 BB) - Healthy stack.\n- Action: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 6 (3x BB). This is a standard raise size.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the data, Kimi-K2 has raised preflop in 3 of the 12 hands I've seen:\n- Hand 2: raised 6\n- Hand 7: raised 6  \n- Hand 8: raised 8\n\nThis suggests Kimi-K2 is moderately aggressive preflop. The 6-chip raise (3x BB) is consistent.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 6 to win 9, so pot odds are 6:9 or 1:1.5. I need ~40% equity to call.\n\n**Hand strength:**\n3c 7d has terrible equity against a standard raising range. Even against a wide range, it's probably around 25-30% equity at best. Against a tighter range, it's worse.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (103 BB)\n- This is a weak speculative hand that needs to hit a miracle flop\n- Calling 6 chips (3% of my stack) isn't huge, but it's still -EV\n- Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots\n\n**Position considerations:**\nWhile being on the button is great, the hand is just too weak. Even if I call, I'll be out of position relative to the raiser (who is in seat 2, which appears to be UTG+1 or MP).\n\n**Decision:**\nFold. This hand is not playable for a raise, even from the button. The pot odds aren't good enough given the hand's terrible equity. Better to wait for a better spot with a stronger hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"3c7d is too weak to call a 3x raise even from the button. Hand has poor equity against a standard raising range, and pot odds (6 to win 9) don't justify calling with such a speculative hand. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots.\"\n}",

            "content": "Looking at this situation with 8s 6d in the small blind:\n\n**Hand Analysis**: 8s 6d is a very weak hand with minimal strength and poor connectivity. Even though it has some straight potential, it's not strong enough to play from the small blind against a raise.\n\n**Opponent Information**: Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been consistently raising preflop in recent hands (raising to 6 in hands #2 and #7, and to 8 in hand #8), suggesting they may have a decent hand or are playing aggressively.\n\n**Position**: Being in the small blind puts me at a significant positional disadvantage postflop, making it even more difficult to play weak hands profitably.\n\n**Stack Considerations**: At 98.5 BB, I have a healthy stack and don't need to take risky spots. I should wait for better opportunities.\n\n**Pot Odds**: While I'm getting about 1.8:1 pot odds (9 chips in pot, need to call 5), the hand strength doesn't justify the call against a likely stronger range.\n\nGiven the weak hand strength, poor position, and facing what appears to be a standard raise from an opponent who has been active, folding is the most prudent decision to preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"8s 6d is too weak to play from small blind against a raise. Opponent Kimi-K2 has been raising consistently, suggesting strength. Better to wait for a stronger hand given my healthy 98.5 BB stack.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 8s 6d - This is a very weak hand, essentially a low connector with no real strength.\n\n2. **Position**: Small blind - This is a terrible position to play a weak hand from, especially when facing a raise.\n\n3. **Action facing**: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised to 6 chips. I need to call 5 more to see the flop.\n\n4. **My stack**: 197 chips (98.5 BB) - I'm at about 100 big blinds, which is a healthy stack.\n\n5. **Opponent information**: From the tool results, I can see that Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been raising preflop in previous hands - they raised to 6 in hand #2, raised to 6 in hand #7, and raised to 8 in hand #8. This suggests they might be playing somewhat aggressively or have a decent hand.\n\n6. **My recent SB play**: Looking at my small blind history, I can see I've been folding a lot from the SB position (win rate of 16.7%), which suggests I should be selective.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 9 chips (SB + BB + Kimi-K2's raise), and I need to call 5. So I'm getting about 1.8:1 pot odds.\n\n8. **Hand strength**: 8s 6d is a very weak hand. Even if it has some connector potential, playing it from the small blind against a raise is generally not profitable.\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: At 98.5 BB, I have a healthy stack and don't need to take risky spots. I should be selective and wait for better opportunities.\n\n10. **Position disadvantage**: Being in the small blind means I'll be out of position postflop, which makes playing weak hands even more difficult.\n \nI'll fold the hand. The weak connector, poor table position, and opponent's aggressive raising pattern all point to a clear decision. With minimal pot odds and a healthy stack, there's no compelling reason to continue with this marginal hand.",

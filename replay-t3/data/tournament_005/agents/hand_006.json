            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**Hand Information:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - excellent position\n- Cards: 9s 6c - offsuit, low suited connector (very weak hand)\n- Stack: 197 chips (98.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- To call: 2 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Folded 3 out of 4 times preflop, raised once (to 6). Limited data but seems somewhat tight.\n- Seat 3 (BB): Folded all 4 recorded preflop hands. Very tight player so far.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 9s 6c is a very weak hand, unsuited and not connected enough to have good implied odds. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: While being on the button is excellent, it doesn't make up for the poor hand quality.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: Both opponents appear to be on the tighter side based on limited data, which means if I call and hit something, they might be more likely to have strong hands and pay me off. However, this is speculative with such limited data.\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3, so 1.5:1 pot odds. With 9s 6c, I'd need much better odds to justify playing this hand.\n\n5. **Stack Size**: I have a healthy stack and don't need to take risks with marginal hands. Preserving my stack is important in tournament play.\n\n6. **Implied Odds**: Even if I hit a 9 or 6, I'll often be dominated by better kickers. If I hit a straight (very unlikely), it could be well-disguised, but the probability is too low to justify the call.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, the pot odds aren't good enough, and I don't need to take unnecessary risks with a healthy stack. Playing 9-6 offsuit from any position is generally a losing play long-term.",

Very weak kicker if I pair the King\n2. Out of position with multiple players yet to act\n3. Poor equity against any reasonable opponent range\n4. The cost to call (2 chips) doesn't justify the risk given the hand strength\n\nThis is a clear fold situation. I should wait for a stronger hand from this position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K2 offsuit from UTG position is too weak to play. Poor kicker, terrible position, and multiple players still to act behind me. Better to wait for a stronger hand.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n**My Hand**: Ks 2d (King of spades, 2 of diamonds)\n**Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - Seat 4\n**Stack**: 200 chips (100 BB)\n**Blinds**: 1/2\n**Pot**: 3 chips\n**Amount to call**: 2 (from the big blind)\n**Minimum raise to**: 4\n\n**Key considerations:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have Ks 2d, which is a very weak hand. The King is high but the 2 is the lowest card possible. This creates a very weak kicker situation. If I make a pair with the King, I'll have a terrible kicker.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (Under the Gun), which is the worst position in poker. I'm first to act with many players left to act behind me. This makes playing weak hands even more dangerous.\n\n3. **Opponent Analysis**: Looking at the history:\n   - Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has shown a pattern of mostly folding (3 folds, 1 raise in 4 hands)\n   - My own history shows I've been folding a lot (4 folds in 5 hands, 1 win)\n   - The table seems to be playing fairly tight so far\n\n4. **Stack Considerations**: At 100 BB, I have a healthy stack and don't need to take risks. Preservation is key.\n\n5. **Mathematical considerations**:\n   - To call costs me 2 chips for a pot of 3 chips (after I call it would be 5 chips total)\n   - This gives me pot odds of 3:2 or 1.5:1\n   - However, with K2 offsuit, I have very poor equity against any reasonable range\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: In tournament play, especially early, preserving stack is crucial. \n\nWeak kickers and poor position make this an easy fold. With multiple opponents still to act, the risks far outweigh any potential benefits. The King-2 offsuit offers minimal winning potential, and I'm better served waiting for a more promising hand.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3c 9d - This is a very weak hand in the BB. It's not connected, not suited, and both cards are low.\n\n2. **Position**: BB (big blind) - I'm out of position post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 in Seat 3 has raised to 48 (3x the BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They fold most of the time preflop (hands 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58)\n   - When they do raise preflop (hand 59), they bet aggressively on the flop\n   - They seem to be a relatively tight player who folds often\n   - Their stack is 169 chips (about 10.5 BB), so they're in a similar situation to me\n\n4. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is 72 chips\n   - I need to call 32 chips\n   - Pot odds: 72:32 or 2.25:1\n   - This means I need ~31% equity to call profitably\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: \n   - I have 239 chips (14.9 BB)\n   - This is a relatively short stack in tournament terms\n   - I should be selective with my hands and avoid marginal spots\n\n6. **Hand equity**: 3c 9d has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a wide range, this hand performs very poorly.\n\n7. **Tournament situation**: With 14.9 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. Calling here with a trash hand out of position would be a mistake.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, I'm out of position, and I should preserve my tournament stack for better opportunities. The 32 chips I'm risking might not seem like much, but it's over 13% of my stack on a hand that has very little chance of winning.\n\nEven though the opponent appears to be tight and might be stealing, 3-9 offsuit is just too weak to defend with, especially when I have to invest 32 chips (13.4% of my stack).",

The big blind (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 239 chips (14.9 BB). Seat 2 has folded.\n\nLooking at the opponent tendencies:\n1. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Very short stack (6.25 BB). From the data, I see they've raised preflop a few times (hands 31, 40, 54), but they're in a desperate spot. They posted SB of 8, so they have 92 left after posting. They might be looking to shove with any decent hand.\n\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has 239 chips (14.9 BB). From the data, they seem to play a mix of hands. In hand 52 they raised from SB with K4s. In hand 57 they raised after a limper. They can be aggressive.\n\nMy hand: KTo offsuit on the button. This is a decent hand in position, especially against short stacks. With 13.6 BB, I'm also somewhat short, but not as desperate as MiniMax-M2.\n\nImportant factors:\n- MiniMax-M2 is extremely short (6.25 BB) and will likely shove with a wide range if they decide to play\n- If I call 16 (1 BB), the pot will be 40, and MiniMax-M2 has 92 behind (5.75 BB)\n- If I raise, I could potentially isolate MiniMax-M2 or get Kimi-K2 Thinking to fold\n- Position is good on the button\n\nGiven the stack sizes:\n- MiniMax-M2 is likely to shove with many hands\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking might call a small raise with a decent hand\n- My KTo is ahead of MiniMax-M2's shoving range\n\nI think raising is the best play here. I want to put pressure on the blinds and potentially win the pot preflop. If MiniMax-M2 shoves, I can call with KTo. If Kimi-K2 Thinking calls, I have position.\n\nA standard raise would be to 40-48 (2.5-3 BB). Since minimum raise is to 32, I'll raise to 48 (3x the BB).\n\nLet me calculate: My stack is 217. Raise to 48 leaves me with 169 behind (10.6 BB). That's reasonable.\n\nIf MiniMax-M2 shoves for 100 total (they have 92 behind after SB of 8), I'd need to call 52 more (100 - 48 = 52). Pot would be: 24 (current) + 48 (my raise) + 100 (their shove) = 172. I'd need to call 52 to win 172, getting 3.3:1 odds. That's a clear call with KTo.\n\nIf Kimi-K2 Thinking calls or raises, I'll have to reassess.\n\nDecision: Raise to 48."

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm on the button with Ks Td, 13.6 BB stack. The small blind (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) has 100 chips (6.25 BB) and is very short. The big blind (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 239 chips (14.9 BB). Seat 2 has folded.\n\nLooking at the opponent tendencies:\n1. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Very short stack (6.25 BB). From the data, I see they've raised preflop a few times (hands 31, 40, 54), but they're in a desperate spot. They posted SB of 8, so they have 92 left after posting. They might be looking to shove with any decent hand.\n\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has 239 chips (14.9 BB). From the data, they seem to play a mix of hands. In hand 52 they raised from SB with K4s. In hand 57 they raised after a limper. They can be aggressive.\n\nMy hand: KTo offsuit on the button. This is a decent hand in position, especially against short stacks. With 13.6 BB, I'm also somewhat short, but not as desperate as MiniMax-M2.\n\nImportant factors:\n- MiniMax-M2 is extremely short (6.25 BB) and will likely shove with a wide range if they decide to play\n- If I call 16 (1 BB), the pot will be 40, and MiniMax-M2 has 92 behind (5.75 BB)\n- If I raise, I could potentially isolate MiniMax-M2 or get Kimi-K2 Thinking to fold\n- Position is good on the button\n\nGiven the stack sizes:\n- MiniMax-M2 is likely to shove with many hands\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking might call a small raise with a decent hand\n- My KTo is ahead of MiniMax-M2's shoving range\n\nI think raising is the best play here. I want to put pressure on the blinds and potentially win the pot preflop. If MiniMax-M2 shoves, I can call with KTo. If Kimi-K2 Thinking calls, I have position.\n\nA standard raise would be to 40-48 (2.5-3 BB). Since minimum raise is to 32, I'll raise to 48 (3x the BB).\n\nLet me calculate: My stack is 217. Raise to 48 leaves me with 169 behind (10.6 BB). That's reasonable.\n\nIf MiniMax-M2 shoves for 100 total (they have 92 behind after SB of 8), I'd need to call 52 more (100 - 48 = 52). Pot would be: 24 (current) + 48 (my raise) + 100 (their shove) = 172. I'd need to call 52 to win 172, getting 3.3:1 odds. That's a clear call with KTo.\n\nIf Kimi-K2 Thinking calls or raises, I'll have to reassess.\n\nDecision: Raise to 48.",

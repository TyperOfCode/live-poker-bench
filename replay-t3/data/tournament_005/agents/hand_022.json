It's not suited, not connected, and both cards are low. This is definitely a folding hand in early position.\n\n**Position:**\nUTG is the worst position - I'll be acting first on every street with 4-5 players yet to act behind me. Playing a weak hand from this position is very dangerous.\n\n**Opponent Information:**\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Posted SB, showed one preflop raise in hand #15. In hand #21 they showed down A-2o, suggesting they might play a wide range.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Posted BB, no preflop raises found. Showed down K-4o in hand #3, also suggesting a potentially wide range.\n\nEven though both opponents in the blinds seem to play wide ranges, my hand is simply too weak to play from UTG. The risk of running into a strong hand from any of the 3-4 players behind me is too high.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nPot is 6, need to call 4, so getting 1.5:1 odds. These aren't good enough for such a weak hand.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. I have a healthy stack and no need to take risks with such a weak hand in early position.",

Otherwise mostly folds preflop. Seems tight.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Mostly folds preflop, called twice. Shows K4o in one showdown. Seems passive.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Current pot: 14 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 8)\n- Amount to call: 6 chips\n- Pot odds: 6 to call for 14 pot = ~30% pot odds\n- Need ~30% equity to call\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- 89o vs likely raising range from tight player: We're dominated\n- As SB, we'll be out of position postflop\n- Implied odds: We have stack depth (47 BB) but position is terrible\n- Reverse implied odds: We could hit a pair and lose to better kicker\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- We have a healthy stack (47 BB)\n- No need to take marginal spots from worst position\n- Seat 4 (BB) still to act behind us - could squeeze or call\n\n**Decision:**\n- Fold is correct here\n- 89o from SB facing raise is not profitable\n- Better to preserve chips for better spots\n- Position is terrible for playing speculative hand\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"89o from SB facing raise from tight player with BB still to act.

This suggests they may be aggressive but with small raises. Our hand JhTc is decent but not premium. We could raise to 8 (minimum) or maybe 12 to isolate. Considering they raise small, a raise to 12 could be a re-raise? But we are first to act. Actually they are not yet acted; we are UTG, they are after us. So we can raise to 8 (2BB) as a standard open. Might be fine. But could also just call? No, calling 4 is not typical from UTG; you would either raise or fold. Folding might be safe. However with 46 BB, you could open with a wide range; JhTc is borderline. Many players open from UTG with JTs suited; offsuit is weaker. I'd lean to fold. But we have information: opponents are aggressive, may 3-bet small. If we raise, we may get 3-bet and be in a tough spot. Might be better to fold.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\n",

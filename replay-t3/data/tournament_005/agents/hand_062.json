Not a hand I want to play.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions post-flop (I'll be acting first).\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's actions:\n   - They raise to 32 (2x the BB) from Seat 4\n   - Recent history shows they fold a lot preflop (hands 55, 56, 57, 59, 61)\n   - When they do play, they show aggression (hand 54: raise pre, bet flop; hand 58: call pre, bet turn and river; hand 60: call pre, bet flop)\n   - Their raise here suggests real strength\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 231 chips (14.4 BB) - this is a short stack in tournament terms\n   - MiniMax-M2 has 68 chips (4.25 BB) - they are very short\n   - The BB (Seat 2) has 392 chips (24.5 BB)\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 24 chips to win 56 (current pot) = 56:24 or about 2.3:1. This is not great odds for a hand this weak.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 14.4 BB, I need to be selective. This is not a spot to invest chips with a weak hand out of position. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nThe raise from MiniMax-M2, given their tendency to fold often preflop, suggests they have a real hand here. My J4o is dominated by almost any reasonable raising hand.\n\nI should fold.",

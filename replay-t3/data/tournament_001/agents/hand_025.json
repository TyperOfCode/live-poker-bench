            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- Position: SB (worst position post-flop)\n- Cards: 3s 7c (very weak, offsuit, low cards, no connectivity)\n- Stack: 369 chips (92.2 BB) - deep stacked\n- Pot: 22 chips\n- To call: 6 chips\n\n**Action:**\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) raised to 8 chips\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) called 8 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis from MiniMax-M2:**\n- Very tight player - folded 13 out of 15 recent hands preflop\n- When they do raise, it seems to be with strong hands (based on hand #9 where they were very aggressive)\n- They just raised from early position (Seat 4 is MP)\n- Stack size: 38 chips (very short)\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 3s 7c is one of the worst starting hands in poker. No pair, no suitedness, no connectivity, low cards.\n\n2. **Position**: SB is terrible position - I'll be first to act on every street post-flop\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 6 to win 22 = 3.67:1 odds = ~21.4% equity needed\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: MiniMax-M2 is very tight/weak based on the data. When they raise, they likely have a strong hand. The call from GPT-OSS-120B also suggests some strength.\n\n5. **Implied Odds**: Very low with this hand. Even if I hit a miracle 3-7-7 or 3-3-3 board, it's hard to get paid off significantly.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: I have a healthy stack (92 BB). No need to take risks with garbage hands. Better spots will come.\n\n7. **Post-flop Playability**: This hand will miss the flop ~90% of the time, and when it hits, it's often second-best (e.g., hitting a 7 when someone has a bigger pair).\n \nThis is a clear fold. The hand offers minimal potential and significant risk, especially from a poor position against a tight player. The combination of weak cards, bad position, and opponent strength makes folding the only sensible choice.",

Against short stack raise, we could call and see flop, but risk being dominated. Also tournament stage? Not given.\n\nWe could raise (re-raise) but min raise is 12 (total). That would be a 3-bet to 12, which is small. Might be considered a squeeze? But opponent is short, likely to call or shove all-in. If we raise to 12, they might call or go all-in (they have 30 left). Could be dangerous.\n\nBetter to consider calling with TQ offsuit? It's a decent hand, but against a short stack who may be stealing, we could call and see flop, but risk being out of position post-flop (we'll be out of position after flop? Actually we are BTN, after flop we will be in position relative to them). So calling is okay.\n\nPot odds: need to call 8 to win pot 14+8=22? Actually pot currently 14 (SB+BB) plus raise 8 = 22? Wait pot before action: SB 2 + BB 4 = 6? Actually pot includes blinds: 2+4=6. Then raise to 8 adds 8 from MiniMax, making pot 6+8=14? The description says pot:14 chips before action. So after call 8, pot becomes 22. So we call 8 to win 22, odds 8/22 = 36%. Hand equity vs opponent's likely range (short stack stealing) maybe around 45%?

            "reasoning_content": "We need decide action on flop. Situation: we are BTN with Th Qc. Board Ah 2h 4c. So we have Ace high, plus gutshot? Actually we have open-ended straight draw? No. We have gutshot to straight: we have Qc, board Ah 2h 4c, need J? Actually we have Th, so we have Ten. Straight possibilities: 10-J-Q-K-A? We have T and Q, need J and K? Not possible. So no straight. Flush draw? Two hearts on board, we have none, so no flush. Pair? We have Ace high, no pair. So hand is weak. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) raised preflop to 8 (from SB? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2 with 34 chips, likely short stack). He is short stack 34 chips, 8 raise is 2/4 blinds? Actually blinds 2/4, so raise to 8 is 2x big blind. He has 34 chips, about 8.5 BB. He is short; could be shoving soon. He bet 4 on flop (half pot). Pot now 30, bet 4, we can call 4. Our stack 125, so we can call. Need evaluate opponent tendencies: short stack may be trying to steal, maybe has overpair like AA, KK, or suited connectors. Board has Ace, so if he has Ace, he'd have top pair, maybe bet. Could be bluff? He raised preflop from SB with 34 chips; maybe he had a wide range (any pair, suited connectors, A-x). He called our call preflop (we called his raise). So he is willing to see flop. On flop he checks, we check? Actually seat 2 (BB) checks, then seat 4 (MiniMax) bets 4. So we need to decide call, raise, fold.\n\nGiven hand is weak, likely fold. But consider pot odds: pot 30, bet 4, we need to call 4 to win 34 (pot+bet). Pot odds ~ 4/34 = 11.8% needed. Our equity with Ace high vs unknown short stack range? Likely low. So folding is correct.\n\nBut maybe we could raise as a bluff? Our stack 125, we could raise to 8 min, but opponent short stack might call all-in? He only has 34 chips left, after bet 4 he has 30 left. If we raise to 8, he could call 4 more (to 8 total) maybe all-in? Actually min raise to 8 means total bet 8, so raise additional 4, making total bet 8. He would need to call 4 more (from 30 left) to 8. He could call and still have chips left. Raising could be a bluff, but we have weak hand and short stack may have strong. Probably fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nReturn JSON.",

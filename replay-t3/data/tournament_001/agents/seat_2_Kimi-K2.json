Fold - too weak to play\n2. Call - cheap price to see flop in position\n3. Raise - try to steal the blinds\n\nGiven the cheap price (only 2 chips) and my position advantage, calling seems reasonable.

Short-stacked player who might be looking to shove.\n\n**Stack Sizes**: \n- I have 32.9 BB, giving me good maneuverability\n- BB only has 5.9 BB, making them a threat to shove over my raise\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With my healthy stack, I can afford to see flops, but need to be cautious of the short stack behind me who might shove.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and stack depth, this is a clear raise.

Fold - too weak to play\n2. Call - cheap price to see flop in position\n3. Raise - try to steal the blinds\n\nGiven the cheap price (only 2 chips) and my position advantage, calling seems reasonable.

The river Jd pairs the board, making trips possible\n2. My opponent has shown no betting aggression this entire hand\n3. They're capable of betting when they have something (as seen in hand 13)\n4. Since they checked the river, they likely have a weak hand or are giving up\n5.

Even though the pot odds might seem reasonable, I have no equity with this hand and would be throwing away chips in a situation where I'm likely dominated.

Very unlikely anyone has quads since I'd need someone to have JJ specifically.\n\n5. **Opponent**: Only Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) is in the hand with 130 chips. They called a big preflop raise.\n\n6. **Action**: It's checked to me, and I can check or bet. Given my tiny stack (8 chips) vs the huge pot (308 chips), I should definitely get all my chips in here.\n\nWith such a strong hand and being pot-committed with my tiny stack, I need to maximize value. Since I can only check or fold (no betting option given), and there's nothing to call, I should check to potentially induce action on the turn.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Have full house with pocket Kings on JJJ board - extremely strong hand.

With my short stack and weak hand, I cannot afford to call off more than half my stack with 93s.

It's too strong to fold, and calling would leave an awkward stack size. A standard raise commits too much of my stack. The ace-high suited hand has great equity against the likely calling range from a short stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 535,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Ad Td is a premium hand with 8.4 BB remaining.

Amount to call is 8 (the big blind)\n\nOpponent observations from the last 20 actions:\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, BB this hand): Has been fairly active. They made a big raise of 111 chips in hand 37, called 8 in hand 40, but has folded several times too. They seem to defend their BB sometimes but also fold frequently.\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB this hand): Has folded many times preflop, but did raise to 40 in hand 39. Generally seems tight.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has folded most hands, raised to 12 in hand 40.\n\nMy hand A9o from UTG is a marginal hand. It's not strong enough to raise from early position in a full ring game. With an Ace I'm somewhat dominated by better aces (AK, AQ, AJ, AT). \n\nFrom UTG, I should have a very tight range. A9o is typically a fold from this position. \n\nIf I call, I'd be investing 8 chips (1 BB) with a hand that will often be dominated and is out of position against everyone else.\n\nThe pot odds are 12:8 or 1.5:1, which isn't great for a marginal hand.\n\nGiven:\n- My position (UTG is worst position)\n- Hand strength (A9o is weak, easily dominated)\n- Stack size (healthy, no need to take marginal spots)\n- Tournament considerations (preserve chips for better spots)\n\nI should fold this hand.",

However, in hand #37 they raised to 111 (shove with ~13.9 BB stack). In hand #40 they called from BB.

That's 3:1 pot odds, which is excellent.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy 35.5 BB stack. The BB is very short (12.9 BB) and might be looking to shove any decent hand. If I just call, they might shove and I'll have to fold unless I hit something.\n\n7. **Options**:\n   - **Fold**: Too weak given position and pot odds\n   - **Call**: Reasonable to see a flop in position with good odds\n   - **Raise**: Could put pressure on the short stack, but Jh8s isn't a great raising hand\n\nGiven the excellent pot odds (3:1), being in position, and the short stack BB who might shove wide, I think calling is best. If I raise, I'm bloating the pot with a weak hand against a short stack who might shove. Calling keeps the pot small and allows me to play postflop in position.\n\nThe BB only has 103 chips, so if they shove, I'll need to consider pot odds on the flop.

I posted SB 4, opponent posted BB 8, I called to complete, opponent checked.\n\nThe flop is Kd 6s 7h. I have Jh 8s - not a great hand. I have a gutshot straight draw (9-T gives me a straight) and a backdoor flush draw with the spade. No pair, no real equity.\n\nLooking at opponent's tendencies from the recall:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been folding a lot preflop (6 of last 10 actions were folds)\n- Only one raise preflop (hand #37, raised to 111)\n- In hand #40, they called BB, checked flop, then folded when facing action\n- They seem fairly passive/weak\n\nThe pot is 16 chips. I'm in position. My hand has limited equity but some potential. With opponent having only 103 chips (12.9 BB), they're relatively short-stacked.\n\nGiven that:\n1. My hand has some draw potential (gutshot + backdoor flush)\n2. I'm in position\n3. Opponent has shown weakness (lots of folds)\n4. The board is fairly dry (K high, no flush draws)\n5. Pot is small\n\nI should probably take a stab at it with a bet. A small bet might take it down now. Even if called, I have position and can see a turn card. My stack is healthy at 35 BB.\n\nHowever, Jh 8s is pretty weak. Let me think about sizing. Minimum raise is 8 (half pot). I could bet 8-12 chips.\n\nActually, wait - I should consider that opponent has only 103 chips. If I bet and they call or raise, I could be committing myself with a weak hand. But given their passive tendencies, they might just fold.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's stack: 103 chips. If I bet 12 chips (3/4 pot), they'd have to call 12 into a 28 chip pot (2.3:1 odds). That's a reasonable bet.\n\nBut my hand is truly weak. Maybe a check is better? Let me think...\n\nActually, I'm in position with initiative. A bet could win the pot immediately. If I check, I give opponent a free card and they might bet on turn if they have something.\n\nI think a small bet is reasonable. If they call or raise, I can easily fold on turn.\n\nLet me bet 8 chips (half pot). That's small enough to not commit too much but enough to apply pressure.",

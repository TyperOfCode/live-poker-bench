This is an easy fold in almost any situation.\n\n**My position**: BTN (Button) - Good position, but doesn't matter with this hand.\n\n**My stack**: 385 chips (12.0 BB) - This is a short stack, but not desperate yet.\n\n**Pot**: 48 chips (1.5 BB)\n\n**Situation**: \n- I posted SB of 16\n- Seat 2 posted BB of 32\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Amount to call: 16 (to complete to the BB)\n- Minimum raise: 64\n\nLet me check my recent hands to see my patterns:\n- Hand #88: BB with 4d 5s - folded preflop\n- Hand #87: BTN with 2s 9c - folded preflop  \n- Hand #86: SB with 2s 5d - folded preflop\n- Hand #85: BB with Ah 6h - won (got a walk)\n- Hand #84: BTN with Ad Jh - raised and won\n\nMy win rate is only 22.7% with 67 folds out of 88 hands. I'm playing pretty tight, which is appropriate.\n\nWith 2d 5s on the Button:\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak. Offsuit, low cards, no connectivity.\n2. **Position**: Good, but doesn't justify playing this trash.\n3. **Stack size**: 12 BB is short but not desperate. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 48 (3:1). These odds aren't good enough for this hand.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I need to preserve my 12 BB stack for better opportunities. This hand has almost no potential to win a big pot.\n\nEven though I'm getting 3:1 pot odds, 2d 5s is just too weak. It's not worth risking 16 chips (1.25% of my stack) on a hand that will rarely win. I should wait for a better hand or situation.\n\nI should fold here.",

I'm on the button with Jc 4d, which is a weak hand. My stack is 312 chips (9.8 BB). Blinds are 16/32. Seat 1 posted SB, Seat 2 posted BB. I need to call 32 chips. Minimum raise to 64.\n\nI should consider opponent tendencies. Let me search for information about the Kimi-K2 opponents. However, I need to respond in JSON format. I'll make a decision based on basic poker strategy.\n\nWith J4o from the button, facing no raises, this is a fold in tournament poker with 9.8 BB. J4o is too weak to play, even from the button. Better to wait for a better spot. My stack is short but not desperate yet.\n\nI'll fold. Let me structure the JSON response.",

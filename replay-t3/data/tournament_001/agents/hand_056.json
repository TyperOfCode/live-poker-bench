I have no information about what other players will do.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 337 chips (42.1 BB) - This is a decent stack, not desperate, so I should play solid poker.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) posted SB and has been active. They raised to 20 in hand 53, folded to a re-raise, and have folded in other spots.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) posted BB and has 111 chips (shortish stack). They made a big re-raise in hand 53 (87 chips), showing they can be aggressive.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 42 BB, I should be focused on preserving my stack and waiting for better spots. KTo from UTG is a marginal hand at best.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 12 (1.5:1), which isn't particularly relevant since I'm folding anyway.\n\nFrom UTG, I should only play premium hands. KTo is definitely not strong enough to open from this position. The risk of running into stronger hands is too high, and if I get 3-bet, I'll be in a tough spot. I should fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

It's ahead of most of Kimi-K2's raising range. From the opponent data, I see Kimi-K2 has raised to 24 several times before (hands 49 and 51). This seems to be their standard opening raise size.\n\n**Position Considerations:**\nI'm in the SB, so I'll be out of position postflop against the raiser. This is a disadvantage, but with JJ it's worth playing.\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\n- My stack: 240 chips (30 BB) - healthy but not huge\n- Kimi-K2: 267 chips\n- BB (GPT-OSS-120B): 111 chips - short stack that could call or shove\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Too weak with JJ\n2. **Call (20)**: Play pot in position disadvantage\n3. **Raise**: 3-bet to isolate\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWith 30 BB, I need to accumulate chips. JJ is a hand worth playing aggressively. A 3-bet would be good here to isolate the raiser and potentially get heads-up.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should 3-bet. Standard sizing would be to 60-72 total (7.5-9x BB). Since minimum raise is to 40, I'll raise to 60 total (which is 56 more from my current 4).\n\nThis puts pressure on Kimi-K2 and isolates them. If they 4-bet or shove, I'll have a decision, but with JJ and 30 BB, I'm likely committed.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 60,\n  \"reasoning\": \"JJ is a strong hand worth 3-betting from SB against a standard raise.

This is an extremely strong hand - only straight draws (T8, 86) or flush draws (diamonds) can beat me right now.\n2. **Opponent stack**: Only 59 chips total. They called my 3-bet preflop with a very short stack.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the data, GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop but made two raises recently (hands 48 and 53). They're short-stacked and likely looking for a spot to double up.\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 144, opponent has 59 total. If I bet, they're getting good odds to call with draws.\n5. **Board texture**: Jd 7d 9c - there's a flush draw (diamonds) and straight draws (T8, 86, maybe QT for gutshot). Also possible two-pair combos like J9, J7, 97.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- With top set, I want to build the pot and get value\n- Opponent is short-stacked (59 chips) - they might be committed with any decent hand\n- I should bet to charge draws and get value from weaker hands\n- Since opponent is so short, I could consider betting enough to put them all-in (they have 59 total, pot is 144)\n- Minimum raise is 36, but I could bet more\n\n**Decision:**\nI should bet to build the pot. Given opponent's short stack, I should bet enough to either get them to commit or fold out their equity. A bet of around 40-50 would leave them with only 9-19 chips behind, making them likely to call with any piece.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: opponent has 59 total. If I bet 50, pot becomes 194, and they'd need to call 50 with 59 behind. That's giving them 3.9:1 odds, which might be too good for draws. I should bet more to price out draws.\n\nBetter to bet 59 (their entire stack) or close to it. That would put them all-in. With top set, I want to get all the money in while I'm ahead.\n\nLet me check: Minimum raise is 36. I could raise to 95 (which would be 35 more than minimum). Actually wait, \"raise_to\" is total amount. Currently pot is 144, amount to call is 0. If I want to bet 59 (putting opponent all-in), I'd need to raise to 59? Let me think...\n\nActually, I need to understand the betting structure. \"Amount to call: 0\" means no bet facing me. If I want to bet 59 chips, I would \"raise\" to 59 (total amount). That's a bet of 59 into 144 pot.\n\nYes, I'll raise to put opponent all-in. With top set on a draw-heavy board, I want to get maximum value and protect against draws.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 59,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Top set on draw-heavy board (flush and straight draws).

Shoving all\u2011in would be too risky with a marginal hand, and folding forfeits any chance to improve. Therefore we call the 52\u2011chip raise.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "We have pocket 6s, small stack 111 chips, blinds 8. After SB 4, BB 8, UTG? Actually seat2 raise 24 (3bb). Seat3 (DeepSeek) re-raises to 60 (7.5bb). So we face a 3-bet to 60, we are in BB, stack 111, pot currently 92 (blinds+SB+BB+raise+re-raise? Let's compute: SB 4, BB 8, seat2 raise to 24 (so put 24, call 24? Actually seat2 raised from 8? Wait seat2 is UTG maybe? He raised to 24, that means he put 24 total, adding 24-8? But BB already posted 8, so seat2's raise is 24 total, meaning 24-8 =16 extra. Then seat3 re-raises to 60, meaning adds 60-24=36. So pot = SB 4 + BB 8 + seat2 24 + seat3 60 = 96? But they say pot 92 chips. Might be rounding. Anyway, amount to call is 52 (to match 60). Minimum raise to 96 (i.e., raise to 96 total). Our stack 111, so we could call 52 leaving 59 chips, or raise all-in 111. Pocket 6s is a small pair, not great against likely stronger ranges. 3-bet from DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat3) maybe aggressive. Our stack short, we could consider calling to set mine, but 6s set odds? Against 3-bet, calling with small pair is okay if implied odds good. However tournament, short stack 13.9 BB, we could either call and hope to hit set (12% chance). If we call, we will be out of position post-flop against a 3-bettor, likely will have to fold unless set. If we go all-in, we are raising to 111 (total). That would be a raise to 111, which is above min raise. That would be a shove. Is that profitable? Our hand is small pair, not strong enough to shove vs 3-bet. Better to call and try set. But we have only 59 chips left after call, still short. If we call and miss set, we likely fold. So expected value: 12% chance win pot (maybe 96+?), but we also risk 52 chips. EV = 0.12* (pot after call? pot would be 60+52 call? Actually we call 52, pot becomes 92+52 =144? Wait initial pot 92 includes seat3's 60. So after we call 52, pot = 92+52 =144. If we hit set, we likely win the pot plus maybe opponent's remaining stack? Opponent seat3 has 184 chips total, after 60 in pot, they have 124 left. Our call leaves us 59 left. If we hit set, we could be all-in for 59 vs their 124? Actually we are not all-in, just called. But they could bet later. So maybe not great.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe better to shove all-in to try to steal blinds? But we have a pair, not a steal. However raising all-in may force fold from seat2 and seat3 if they think we have premium. But seat3 just 3-bet, likely strong. So likely they'd call. Not good.\n\nThus best is call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. So choose call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with pocket 6s (6h6d). Board Jd 7d 9c. No flush draw, straight draw? 6 gives open-ended? 6-7-8-9? We have 6, board 7-9, missing 8 for gutshot straight (needs 8). Also need 5 for 5-6-7-8-9? Actually we have 6, board 7,9, need 8 and 5? Not relevant. So we have a low pair, likely losing to overpairs, J, etc. Opponent seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 59 into pot 203 (so about 0.29 pot). Their betting pattern: historically small flop bets (4,8,15) relative to pot. This seems a continuation bet, maybe with a wide range. Our hand is weak. We have 59 to call, min raise 118 but we cannot raise (legal only fold/call). So we can call or fold. Should we call? Evaluate pot odds: pot 203 + opponent bet 59 = 262 total after call. Call 59 to win 262 => odds 4.44:1. Need win >22.5% to be profitable. Our hand likely far less. So fold.\n\nBut consider tournament situation: stack 59 chips (7.4 BB). We're short-stacked, but we have 59 chips left (including 8 BB). Actually we have 59 chips total, we already posted 8 BB, we called 52 preflop, leaving 59? Wait stack after preflop call: Starting stack 59, posted 8 BB, called 52 (makes total 60? Actually call 52 includes 8? In preflop, we posted 8 BB then called 52 additional? Usually call amount includes BB? The action says call 52 meaning you put 52 total (including BB?) Not sure. But they say stack 59 chips now, so after posting BB and calling preflop, we have 59 left. So we are very short, 7.4 BB. On flop, opponent bets 59 (our entire stack). So calling would be all-in. Actually amount to call 59 equals our stack. So calling would be all-in, we risk elimination. Our hand is very weak; likely fold.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

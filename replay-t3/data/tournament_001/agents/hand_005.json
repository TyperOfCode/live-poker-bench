Hardly any playability postflop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions. I'll be first to act postflop.\n\n3. **Opponent action**: \n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 2\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 4\n   - I need to call 3 more chips\n\n4. **Pot odds**: There's currently 9 chips in the pot (1+2+2+4). I need to call 3, so pot odds are 3:1 or 25% equity needed.\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: I have 191 chips (95.5 BB), so calling 3 chips is not a big hit to my stack, but it's still -EV with this hand.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: The search for GPT-OSS-120B raises returned no results, so I don't have historical data on this player yet.\n\nWith T4 offsuit, even getting 3:1 pot odds, this is a clear fold. This hand has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range. I could be dominated easily, and even if I hit a T or 4, I'll often be outkicked. The hand also has poor straight and flush potential.\n\nI should preserve my chips and wait for a better spot. Folding is the correct play here.",

Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have Qc Kc, which is a very strong hand - suited connectors with high cards. This gives me potential for straights, flushes, and high pairs.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (Under The Gun), which means I'm first to act preflop. This is a very weak position as I have to act before seeing what anyone else does.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 237 chips (118.5 BB), which is a healthy stack. I'm not short-stacked, so I can play somewhat aggressively.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 191 chips\n   - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 178 chips  \n   - Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 231 chips (already folded)\n   - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 160 chips\n\n5. **Current Action**: It's preflop, blinds are 1/2, pot is 3 chips. Seat 1 posted small blind (1), Seat 2 posted big blind (2), Seat 3 folded. I need to call 2 chips or raise.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: This is early in the tournament (hand #5), so I should be building my stack but not taking unnecessary risks.\n\nGiven I'm UTG with Qc Kc, this is actually a pretty decent hand. Suited connectors can be very profitable, especially when you hit big. However, being UTG means I need to be careful about raising too aggressively because I could easily be dominated by players behind me.\n\nI should consider:\n- Calling to see the flop cheap and try to hit something big\n- Raising to build the pot when I have a good hand\n- The fact that I have position disadvantage UTG\n\nLet me think about the best approach. Qc Kc is strong enough to raise from UTG, but I need to be aware that I'm out of position for the rest of the hand. \n\nThe small blind and big blind have relatively similar stack sizes to mine, which suggests this could be a multi-way pot. Qc Kc plays well in multi-way pots, especially when suited.\n\nI'll likely call to keep the pot manageable and maintain position flexibility. The suited connectors offer potential for significant gains if I connect with the board.\n",

So amount to call is 2 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to 4 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide action. Hand K3 offsuit (K3). In BTN, decent but not premium. Consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 called the BB from CO? Actually seat 4 is CO (since BTN seat5, seat4 is CO). They just called. They may be playing a wide range from CO. K3 is okay to raise? Might be okay to raise for value and isolation. But we have relatively deep stack (80 BB) and can open raise to 4 (2x BB). Typically open raise 2.5-3 BB. So raising to 4 is fine. However we need to consider that they already called. We are in position, can either raise or call. Raising could isolate and get folds from later players (none left). Only SB and BB are already in pot. SB already posted 1, BB 2, and CO called 2. So raising may get them to call more. SB might fold or call. BB might call or raise. K3 is not a strong hand for a 3-bet; but a raise from BTN is standard open, not a 3-bet. So it's okay to raise to 4. The pot after raise would be 5 + 4 (our raise) = 9? Actually current pot 5 (SB1+BB2+CO2). If we raise to 4 total, we add 2 more chips (since we need to call 2 then raise 2 more). So new pot 7? Wait compute: SB 1, BB 2, CO 2, we put 4 total (so we add 4). So total pot = 1+2+2+4 =9. Yes.\n\nCalling just adds 2, making pot 7. K3 has some equity but not great vs unknown range. Raising may fold SB and BB if they are tight. Could also get a call from them, building pot. Considering tournament early stage? Stack 80 BB, still deep. Might want to preserve chips, but also accumulate. K3 is not a hand to risk too much; but raising to 4 is low risk.\n\nCheck is not allowed because amount to call is 2. So options fold, call, raise.\n\nGiven typical strategy, I would raise to 4 to try to steal blinds and isolate CO. So decision: raise to 4.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: we are BTN with 3d Kh. Board: 9d Qh 5d. So we have a flush draw (diamonds) with King high, plus backdoor straight possibilities? Not really. Also we have gutshot? 3d Kh gives us king high, no pair. We have a flush draw (4 outs to make flush? Actually we have two diamonds (3d) and board has two diamonds (9d,5d) so we have 4 diamonds total, need one more diamond to make flush. There are 13 diamonds total, 4 known, so 9 outs. Also we have an overcard King to board (Q,9,5). Potential for top pair if a K hits? Not on board. So currently we have 0 pair, but we have a backdoor straight? Not relevant.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 is on the button? Actually they are seat 4, which is CO? Seats: 1 SB, 2 BB, 3 (?), 4 is MiniMax-M2, 5 is us. So seat 4 is likely cutoff (CO). Preflop: they called 2 after we raised to 4, so they have a hand that can call a 2BB raise. They could have a wide range: suited connectors, broadways, etc.\n\nFlop: they bet 2 into pot 13. That's a small bet (about 1/3 pot). Could be a continuation bet (c-bet) with a wide range, possibly also a draw, or a weak hand. They might be trying to see cheap. Our hand: flush draw with overcards. Pot odds: call 2 to win 13+2 = 15 pot? Actually pot currently 13, they bet 2, so total pot after call = 13+2+2 = 17? Wait: pot before flop bet = 13. They bet 2, so if we call, we add 2, making pot 15? Let's calculate: preflop pot: blinds 1+2=3, plus our raise 4 and their call 2? Actually preflop: SB 1, BB 2, we raise to 4 (so we put 4, they already posted 2, need 2 more), they call 2, they put total 4? Wait: preflop actions: Seat1 post_sb 1, Seat2 post_bb 2, Seat3 fold, Seat4 call 2 (so they call the raise, they put 2 more to match our 4? Actually raise to 4 means total 4, they had posted 2, need 2 more, they call 2). Seat5 raise 4 (we raise to 4, we put 4). Seat1 fold, Seat2 fold, Seat4 call 2 (they call our raise). So preflop contributions: SB 1, BB 2, us 4, them 4 (2 call + 2 call). Total pot = 1+2+4+4 = 11? But given pot is 13. Maybe includes antes? Not relevant. Anyway pot is 13, they bet 2, so pot after bet = 15, call 2 makes pot 17. So calling 2 gives us 2 to win 15 (pot before call). So pot odds = 2/15 \u2248 13.3%, we need about 13% equity. Our flush draw has about 9 outs, plus maybe some combos for pair? Actually we also have overcard King, could pair on turn or river. So total outs maybe ~12? Approx equity ~ (outs*2)/100 = 18% on turn, plus additional on river ~? So we have >13% equity, so call is profitable.\n\nWe could also consider raising. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., total 4). That would be a raise of 2 extra beyond call? Actually they bet 2, raise to 4 means add 2 more. That would be a small raise, maybe to protect or to build pot. But raising could be risky if they have strong hand and re-raise. Our hand is not strong enough to raise for value. Could raise as semi-bluff to fold out better hands? Their bet is small; raising may just get called and we risk more chips.\n\nGiven we have a decent draw and pot odds are good, best is call.\n\nCheck stack: 156 chips, 78 BB, we can afford call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: BTN with 3d Kh (King high, 3 of diamonds). Board: 9d Qh 5d 8c. So after turn, board: 9d Qh 5d 8c. Turn card is? Not specified; board shows 4 cards: 9d Qh 5d 8c. The turn is 8c (since flop had 9d Qh 5d, turn 8c). So board now: 9d Qh 5d 8c. We have King of hearts and 3 of diamonds. Our hand: currently a gutshot? We have a straight draw? Let's see possible straight: 9-10-J-Q-K? We have Q on board, need J and K? We have K, missing J and 10. Not a straight yet. Also we have a flush draw? Board has two diamonds (9d,5d) and we have 3d, so three diamonds total. Need two more diamonds for flush, not there yet. So currently we have high card K, maybe pair? No. So we have nothing, just K high.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) is in seat 4, has been playing. Preflop they called 2 (small blind?), they are in BB? Actually seat 2 is BB, seat 4 called 2 preflop (so they were in SB? Wait seat 1 posted sb 1, seat 2 posted bb 2. Seat 4 call 2: that suggests they were in UTG? Actually they called big blind? But they are not in blind, they just called 2. So they have a random hand.\n\nFlop: board 9d Qh 5d. Opponent bet 2 (small). We called 2. So they are continuing aggression.\n\nTurn: opponent bet 2 again (small). We need to decide.\n\nOur stack 154, pot 17, opponent bet 2, so pot after call would be 19. We have K high, no draw. Likely fold.\n\nBut consider tournament situation: 77 BB, opponent 229 chips, we have 154. We could consider a bluff raise? Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise total to 4). That's a raise of 2 more chips. Could attempt a steal? But we are out of position? Actually we are BTN, we are in position (acting after them). They bet 2, we could raise to 4 (i.e., raise 2 more). That would be a small raise. But with K high, maybe we can bluff as they may have missed the turn. However they bet again, suggests they have something or are bluffing. Could be a draw or made hand. Our K high is weak.\n\nGiven pot odds: To call 2 to win 17 (plus opponent's 2?), pot is 17, they bet 2 making pot 19, call 2 wins 19. So pot odds 2/19 ~10.5%, good. But we have no equity; we would only call if we think we have some chance to improve on river (maybe a straight draw?). After turn, board: 9d Qh 5d 8c. We have Kh 3d. Potential outs: Straight draw? Let's check: we could have a straight with 7-6? Actually board: 5-8-9-Q. Straight possibilities: 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 6 and 7). Not possible. 7-8-9-10-J (needs 7,10,J). Not. 8-9-10-J-Q (needs 10,J). We have K, not. 9-10-J-Q-K (needs 10,J). So we have K, but need 10 and J. Not many outs. Flush draw: we have 3d, board has 9d,5d. Need two more diamonds on river, impossible (only one card left). So no outs. So we should fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nWe must output JSON.\n\n",

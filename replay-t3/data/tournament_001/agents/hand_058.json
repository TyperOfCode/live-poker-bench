Wait, let me re-read this... \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\" and \"preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 4\". So I posted the small blind, which means I'm actually in the SB position, not BTN. But the description says \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\" which is confusing. Let me think about this...\n\nActually, looking at the actions:\n- Seat 1 (me) posted SB 4\n- Seat 2 posted BB 8\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 5 folded\n\nSo it appears the button is on Seat 1, but I posted the SB. This would mean the button and SB are the same seat, which can happen in heads-up play, but we have multiple players. Let me re-examine...\n\nWait, the problem says \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\" but then \"preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 4\". This suggests that either:\n1. The positions are mislabeled, or\n2. It's a situation where the BTN also posts the SB (which happens in heads-up)\n\nBut we have Seat 2 (BB) with 271 chips, and they're still in the hand. So it's not heads-up yet. Let me think about the table configuration again...\n\nActually, maybe the \"BTN\" label is just telling me I'm on the button, but due to the posting sequence, I ended up posting the SB. This could be a tournament setting where the button is on Seat 1, but the blinds are posted by Seats 1 and 2. Let me assume I'm actually in the SB position, but the \"BTN\" label is just informing me about where the button is.\n\n**My Hand: Jc Js** - Pocket Jacks. This is a very strong hand preflop, especially in this situation where I'm facing only one opponent (the BB).\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\n- Me: 325 chips (40.6 BB)\n- BB (Kimi-K2): 271 chips (33.9 BB)\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 4 chips to win 12 chips (3:1 odds). This is an easy call with pocket Jacks.\n\n**Decision Point:** I have three options:\n1. Fold - Absolutely not with pocket Jacks\n2. Call - See a flop for 4 chips\n3. Raise - Build the pot and likely get heads-up\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength:** Pocket Jacks is a premium hand. Against a random hand, I'm about 77% favorite. Even against a strong range, I'm well ahead.\n\n2. **Opponent:** The BB is Kimi-K2 with 271 chips. I should try to recall their tendencies. Let me search for information about this opponent.\n\n3. **Position:** I'm out of position against the BB (if I'm in SB). But if I'm actually on the BTN, I have position. Let me think about this more carefully...\n\nActually, re-reading the problem: \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\". Then \"preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 4\". This is contradictory. In a standard poker game, the BTN doesn't post the SB. However, in some tournament software, the button might be tracked separately from the seat that posts the blind.\n\nLet me assume the most likely scenario: I'm actually in the SB position, but the button is on Seat 1 (me). This would mean I'm out of position postflop.\n\nBut wait, maybe the \"BTN\" label is just telling me that according to the tournament rotation, I'm on the button, but due to the specific table configuration, I'm posting the SB. This could happen if there are empty seats or if it's a weird configuration.\n\nActually, looking at the players:\n- Seat 1: Me (325 chips)\n-"

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the opponent's behavior:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been relatively passive\n- They fold often preflop (hands 52, 53, 56)\n- When they do play, they can call (hand 55, 57) and occasionally raise (hand 56)\n- In hand 55, they called preflop then bet 16 on the flop\n- In hand 57, they called preflop and then checked down to showdown with pocket 4s\n\nFrom the showdowns:\n- Hand 57: They had 4d 4s (pocket 4s) and called preflop, suggesting they'll call with small pocket pairs\n- Hand 30: They had Tc 7d (T7 offsuit) - this seems like they were in the BB and checked\n\nSo the opponent seems to be a relatively straightforward player who:\n- Folds weak hands preflop\n- Calls with medium strength hands like small pocket pairs\n- Can occasionally raise but also folds to pressure\n- Plays somewhat passively postflop\n\n**My Analysis:**\n\nWith pocket Jacks (Jc Js) in this spot:\n- I'm facing only the BB (everyone else folded)\n- I have a premium hand that dominates most of the opponent's range\n- The opponent has shown they'll call with hands like pocket 4s\n- My stack is healthy at 40.6 BB\n- The opponent's stack is 33.9 BB\n\n**Decision:** I should raise to build the pot and extract value from my premium hand. A standard raise would be 3x the BB (24 chips), but since I'm in the SB and it's 4 more to call, a raise to 24-32 chips would be appropriate.\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to call with medium hands and my position (assuming I'm SB/out of position), I should make a solid raise. Let me raise to 24 chips (3x BB) which is standard.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise: it's 16 chips. A 3x BB raise would be to 24 chips total. This seems appropriate.\n\nLet me reconsider the position confusion. The problem states \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\" but then shows \"preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 4\". This is contradictory. However, the key information is:\n- I posted 4 chips (SB)\n\n\n- Seat 2 posted 8 chips (BB)\n- I need to call 4 more chips\n\nI'll carefully evaluate my position and potential actions. The conflicting position information requires a precise approach to maximize my advantage with pocket Jacks.\n\nCalculating the raise mechanics reveals nuanced possibilities. A 3x big blind raise to 24 chips represents a strategic move that balances aggression with pot control. This sizing pressures opponents while maintaining flexibility for future streets.\n\nThe hand's dynamics suggest a calculated raise that extracts value and potentially isolates weaker holdings. My pocket Jacks warrant a confident, well-sized preflop action.",

Has been folding most hands preflop (folded 6 of last 7 hands, checked one).\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): 271 chips. Has shown some aggression (raised in hand 56), called with small pairs (44 in hand 57).\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 55 chips (short stack). Has shown aggression with raises (hands 48, 53) and folds frequently.\n\n**Observations:**\n1. Seat 1 is very tight, folding most hands.\n2. Seat 2 has shown willingness to play and raise.\n3. Seat 5 is short-stacked and aggressive when playing.\n4. I have a healthy stack and can afford to be selective.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- KTs from UTG is marginal. Usually I'd fold this in early position unless the table is very passive.\n- The table seems fairly active with Seat 2 and Seat 5 showing aggression.\n- With 41 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n- The blinds are small relative to stacks.\n\nFrom poker theory: KTs is a hand that plays better in late position. In UTG, it's often a fold in full ring. Given the opponent tendencies and my position, folding seems correct.\n\nHowever, let me consider alternatives:\n- Call: Could see a flop cheaply, but out of position against 4 players.\n- Raise: Would be raising with a marginal hand from early position, likely getting called by better hands or putting myself in tough spots.\n\nBetter to wait for better spots. I'll fold."

Decent hand but not premium from UTG.\n**Stack:** 328 chips (41 BB) - Healthy stack\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): 325 chips. Has been folding most hands preflop (folded 6 of last 7 hands, checked one).\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): 271 chips. Has shown some aggression (raised in hand 56), called with small pairs (44 in hand 57).\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 55 chips (short stack). Has shown aggression with raises (hands 48, 53) and folds frequently.\n\n**Observations:**\n1. Seat 1 is very tight, folding most hands.\n2. Seat 2 has shown willingness to play and raise.\n3. Seat 5 is short-stacked and aggressive when playing.\n4. I have a healthy stack and can afford to be selective.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- KTs from UTG is marginal. Usually I'd fold this in early position unless the table is very passive.\n- The table seems fairly active with Seat 2 and Seat 5 showing aggression.\n- With 41 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n- The blinds are small relative to stacks.\n\nFrom poker theory: KTs is a hand that plays better in late position. In UTG, it's often a fold in full ring. Given the opponent tendencies and my position, folding seems correct.\n\nHowever, let me consider alternatives:\n- Call: Could see a flop cheaply, but out of position against 4 players.\n- Raise: Would be raising with a marginal hand from early position, likely getting called by better hands or putting myself in tough spots.\n\nBetter to wait for better spots.

Action: SB posted 4, BB posted 8. Amount to call is 8. Minimum raise to 16. Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nI previously reasoned that KTs from UTG is marginal and I should fold. That seems reasonable. But let me double-check if there's any reason to play this hand.\n\nTable has 5 players: Seat 1 (SB, 325 chips), Seat 2 (BB, 271 chips), Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 (55 chips short stack). Seat 1 is tight, Seat 2 has shown some aggression, Seat 5 is short and aggressive.\n\nFrom UTG, KTs is definitely a fold in most situations. The only reason to play would be if the table is very passive or if I have a strong read. But Seat 2 has shown aggression, so I could get raised behind me. Also, being out of position with a drawing hand like KTs is tough.\n\nWith 41 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. Better to wait for better positions or stronger hands.\n\nSo I'll fold. Need to output JSON: {\"action\": \"fold\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"KTs from UTG is marginal, especially with aggressive players behind. Better to wait for stronger spots with position.\"}\n\nWait, the reasoning should be brief. Let me make it concise.\n\nActually, let me check if there are any other considerations. The short stack at Seat 5 might shove over a raise, which could be problematic. Also, I have no specific reads that the table is particularly weak.\n\nYes, fold is correct. Let me output the JSON.",

J7o is a weak hand, especially out of position\n2. MiniMax-M2 has been very tight (folding many hands in a row)\n3. When they do play, they can be aggressive\n4. I'm out of position\n5. I have a healthy stack and don't need to take marginal spots\n\nI should fold. Even though the pot odds are decent, playing J7o out of position against a tight-aggressive opponent is not profitable in the long run. I can wait for better spots with my big stack.",

Seat 5 (SB) posted 2, Seat 1 (BB) posted 4, and Seat 2 folded. So it's my action with 4 to call.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking, BB, 371 chips): Has raised preflop in 4 of 10 hands, including a raise to 12 last hand. Seems aggressive when they play.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2, 40 chips): Has folded 9 of last 10 hands, only raised once in hand 14. Very tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B, SB, 133 chips): Has folded 7 of 10 hands, called once, raised once, bet once on flop. Somewhat tight but capable of aggression.\n\nMy position is UTG - worst position at the table. With 6c4c, this is a clear fold from UTG. Suited connectors play better in later positions with more players to potentially call. From UTG, I'd be opening with this weak hand into 4 players left to act, including an aggressive BB.\n\nMy stack is healthy at 60 BB, no need to gamble with marginal hands from early position. Better to wait for stronger spots.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 4 into pot of 6, so getting 1.5:1 odds, but implied odds with suited connectors could be decent if I hit a flush or straight. However, position is terrible and I'll be out of position post-flop against potentially multiple opponents.\n\nTournament considerations: Preserving stack is important. No need to play marginal hands from early position.\n\nDecision: Fold. This is standard poker - fold weak suited connectors from UTG.",

In the most recent hand (#23), they made a substantial raise to 12 chips. This suggests they're willing to be aggressive preflop.\n\n- **GPT-OSS-120B**: Has been mostly folding preflop, but did call 1 chip in hand #19 and then bet 2 on the flop. Also raised to 8 chips in hand #21 but folded to further action. This suggests they're somewhat passive but will play hands when they see them cheaply.\n\n**Strategic Considerations**:\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket tens are very strong, especially against a likely wide range from the blinds\n2. **Position**: I'm in the best possible position (button)\n3. **Stack Size**: At 10 BB, I'm short-stacked, which means I need to be more aggressive to avoid being blinded out\n4. **Pot Odds**: The minimum raise to 8 chips gives me good odds to isolate with my strong hand\n\nGiven that:\n\n\nMy pocket tens offer a significant strategic advantage. With strong hole cards and optimal table position, I'm positioned to make a decisive move. The short stack and aggressive opponent dynamics create an ideal scenario for a bold preflop strategy. Raising to 8 chips leverages my hand's strength, potentially isolating against weaker ranges while maximizing my positional advantage.\n\nThe key factors - hand quality, stack size, and opponent tendencies - all point toward an aggressive preflop approach that could significantly improve my tournament standing.\n",

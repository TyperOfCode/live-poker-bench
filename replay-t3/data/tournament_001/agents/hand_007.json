I have a very tight image so far.\n\n2. **My current hand**: Kc3s (King of clubs, 3 of spades) - this is a weak hand, unsuited and with a big gap. This is definitely a fold in UTG position.\n\n3. **Opponent observations**:\n   - MiniMax-M2 has been aggressive (raised to 20 in hand 4, made multiple bets)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been somewhat active but also folds to pressure\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 and other Kimi-K2 have been mostly folding\n\n4. **Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. I need a very strong hand to play from here.\n\n5. **Stack size**: I have 191 chips (95.5 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: Since I've folded every hand so far, I have a very tight image. However, K3 offsuit is simply too weak to play from UTG, even with a tight image. The hand has poor equity and will be difficult to play post-flop.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 chips to win 3, which is 1.5:1 pot odds. Even with these odds, K3 offsuit is not worth playing from UTG.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. K3 offsuit is in the bottom 20% of hands and should never be played from UTG in a full ring game. The fact that I'm playing tight doesn't change the fundamental weakness of this hand. I should wait for a better spot.",

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is in the big blind and hasn't shown aggressive tendencies.\n\nMy hand 5s8d is very weak - off-suit, no connectivity, low cards. In the small blind, facing a raise, this is an easy fold. The pot is 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 5 more chips (already have 1 in). That's 5 to win 9, giving me about 1.8:1 pot odds, but with such a weak hand, I'm unlikely to make a strong hand postflop.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 231 chips (115.5 BB) - a healthy stack. Seat 2 has 171 chips, Seat 4 has 244 chips. No need to take risks with marginal hands.\n\nPosition is bad - I'll be out of position postflop against the raiser.\n\nBased on opponent history: Seat 2 raised only once before (hand #1 with 18 chips raise from UTG? need to check). Actually, looking at the data: in hand #1, Seat 2 raised to 18 preflop then folded later. So they might have raised with a strong hand that time.

Current situation: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 6 chips, I need to call 4 more to see the flop\n4. Opponent analysis: From the recall data, Kimi-K2 has been quite active with raises and folds, showing a pattern of being aggressive preflop but folding to pressure\n\nKey considerations:\n- This is a very weak hand (2c 6c) - one of the worst possible starting hands\n- I'm getting pot odds of 9:4 (2.25:1) to call, which isn't great for such a weak hand\n- I'm in the BB, so I have position disadvantage\n- The opponent has been raising and folding, suggesting they might be aggressive but not committed\n- My stack is 244 chips (122 BB), so I have plenty of chips to survive this hand\n\nGiven that this is such a weak hand, and I'm not getting great pot odds to justify calling with 2c 6c, I should fold. Even though I'm in the BB and have already invested 2 chips, throwing good money after bad is not sound poker strategy. The chance of making a strong hand with 2c 6c is very low, and even if I do hit something, I could easily be outdrawn or beaten by a better hand.\n\nI should fold this hand and wait for a better opportunity.",

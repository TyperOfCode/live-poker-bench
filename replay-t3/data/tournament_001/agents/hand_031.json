It's not strong enough to raise for value, but on the button with a tight player in BB, it might be playable.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is a huge advantage - I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - BB (DeepSeek-V3.2) is very tight, folding most hands. If I call, they're likely to have a strong hand when they don't fold.\n   - SB (Kimi-K2) is aggressive and plays many hands.\n4. **Pot odds**: Need to call 4 to win 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. Not great for Ace-8.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. Calling with a marginal hand could get me in trouble, especially against a tight BB who will only continue with strong hands.\n\nThe tight BB player is key here. If I call and the BB has a strong hand (which is likely given their tightness), I'll be out of position against them postflop (though I'll act after the aggressive SB). \n\nAce-8 offsuit plays poorly postflop, especially when the BB is tight. I could raise to try to steal the blinds, but:\n- The SB is aggressive and might defend\n- The BB is tight but when they call/raise, they'll have me dominated\n\n\nI'll fold this marginal hand. The tight big blind's range makes Ace-8 offsuit too risky. Despite my button position, the potential to be dominated and the poor pot odds make folding the smartest move. I want to preserve my stack for better opportunities.",

Additionally, the opponent's raise size (3x) is standard, but we don't have a strong read that they're overly loose.\n\nGiven the positional disadvantage and weak hand strength, I should fold.

In a tournament early-ish with 30 BB, UTG raising is possible but many players would fold. However 8K is not a premium hand; many players would fold to a raise. Could also consider calling the big blind (4) to see flop cheap. But position is early, risk of being out of position.\n\nWe should consider opponent tendencies: we have two players left: Seat2 posted SB (2) and Seat3 posted BB (4). Actually seat2 is SB with 2 chips? Wait SB is 2, they posted 2 chips, seat3 is BB posted 4 chips. So we are facing a raise? No, we are facing amount to call 4 (the BB). So it's preflop, it's our turn, we can call 4 to see flop. The legal actions are fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: we have 119, others have 357,241,268. So we have shortest stack.\n\nRaising with 8K could be a steal attempt, but being UTG is not a steal; the blinds are small relative to stack. If we raise to minimum 8 (i.e., total 8 chips), that's a raise of 4 over BB. That would be a 2x BB raise. Not a big raise. Might get called by both SB and BB.\n\nGiven our hand is not strong, maybe we should fold. But we also have a short stack; we may need to pick spots to pick up chips.\n\nWe could call and see flop cheaply, hoping to hit a straight or pair. 8K is decent but not great.\n\nI think best is to fold preflop.\n\nBut we could also consider calling to see flop and maybe steal later. However being out of position UTG, postflop play is tough.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

            "reasoning_content": "  The search didn't return any results, which suggests this might be early in the tournament or we don't have much history on these opponents yet. Let me think about this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I have 2d 3d (2-3 suited) on the BTN\n- Pot is 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n- I need to call 4 chips to see the flop\n- My stack is 351 chips (87.8 BB)\n- Only SB and BB remain besides me\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n2-3 suited is a very weak hand. Even though it's suited, the cards are too low and too disconnected. \n- In a heads-up or 3-way pot from the button, we might consider playing some speculative hands\n- However, 2-3 suited has very poor equity against typical calling ranges\n- We're only getting 1.5:1 pot odds (need to call 4 to win 6)\n- Even if we hit a flush, we could easily be beaten by higher flushes\n- If we hit a straight (A-2-3-4-5), we have the low end\n\n**Position advantage:**\n- We have position on both remaining players (BTN)\n- This is valuable, but not enough to justify playing such a weak hand\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- We're deep enough (87.8 BB) to make speculative plays, but...\n- This hand has very poor playability post-flop\n- We'd be playing out of position post-flop despite being on the button (since we'd be first to act if we just call and SB checks)\n\n**Opponent considerations:**\n- No history available on these specific players\n- SB has 241 chips (60 BB) - relatively healthy stack\n- BB has 268 chips (67 BB) - also healthy\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is an easy fold. 2-3 suited is simply too weak to play even with position advantage. We should preserve our chips for better spots. The pot odds are not attractive enough, and the hand has very poor equity realization.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Ks Jc - decent offsuit broadway hand, but not premium. KJo is a reasonable hand to defend from BB, but not amazing.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, out of position for the rest of the hand. This is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**: Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, SB) has raised to 12 total (8 more to call). Looking at their raise history: they've raised preflop frequently (8 times in 34 hands). Their raises vary in size: 6, 12, 18, 24. The 12 raise is on the smaller side. They showed Tc 7d in one showdown, suggesting they can raise with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 268 chips (67 BB), opponent has 231 chips (57.75 BB). Both deep stacked.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 16 chips (4 from me as BB, 2 from SB, 10 raise). I need to call 8 to win 16, giving me 2:1 odds (33% equity needed).\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: We're both deep, so not desperate. I have a comfortable stack.\n\n7. **Alternatives**: \n   - Fold: KJo out of position against a raise isn't great\n   - Call: Reasonable given pot odds and hand strength\n   - Raise: Could 3-bet, but KJo isn't a great 3-bet bluff candidate from BB\n\nGiven the pot odds (33% equity needed) and KJo having ~40% equity against a typical SB raising range, calling seems reasonable. I'm getting good immediate odds, and I have position on the flop (they act first postflop since they're SB). However, being out of position overall is a concern.\n\nLooking at my history: I've been folding a lot (24 folds out of 34 hands). Might be good to defend my blind occasionally with a decent hand.\n\nI'll call and see a flop.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Kd 7d - This is a marginal hand. It's suited, which gives some potential for flushes, but the King is dominated by many hands (any Ace, any King with a better kicker). It's not a great hand to play, especially out of position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB (small blind), which is the worst position post-flop. I'll be acting first on every street.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 489 chips (30.6 BB). This is a healthy stack, so I can afford to be selective.\n\n4. **The action**: \n   - Blinds are 8/16\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised to 122 (a large raise of about 7.6x the big blind)\n   - I need to call 114 to see the flop\n   - Pot will be 146 + 114 = 260 if I call\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for DeepSeek-V3.2:\n   - They folded preflop in hands 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73 (6 out of 7 recent hands)\n   - They called in hand 72 with Qc Ah (a premium hand)\n   - They showed down 2s Ts in hand 64 and Qc Ah in hand 72\n   - This suggests they're playing very tight - only entering pots with strong hands\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 114 to win 260, which is about 2.3:1 pot odds. This is not great for a marginal hand like K7s.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 30BB, I should be looking for better spots. K7s from SB against a tight player's large raise is not a profitable situation.\n\n8. **Hand equity**: K7s has about 35-40% equity against a typical raising range from a tight player (which would include big pairs, AK, AQ, etc.). The pot odds don't justify this call, especially out of position.\n\nThe raise size of 122 from a player who usually folds suggests they have a very strong hand. My K7s is easily dominated and I'm out of position. This is a clear fold.",

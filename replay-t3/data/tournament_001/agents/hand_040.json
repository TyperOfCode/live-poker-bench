I have to act first on every street, which puts me at a significant disadvantage.\n\n**Stack**: 333 chips (83.2 BB) - I have a healthy stack, not deep but not short either.\n\n**Pot**: 6 chips (blinds only)\n\n**Opponents**: Looking at the recall data:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 has been raising preflop, including a 40 chip raise in hand #39 and a 10 chip raise in hand #37\n- GPT-OSS-120B made a big 111 chip all-in raise in hand #37\n- Both seem capable of aggressive preflop action\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 83 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots from bad position. The suited connector has some playability, but from UTG it's too risky.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 6, which is 1.5:1 pot odds. This isn't particularly compelling for a marginal hand.\n\nThe 7h 8h suited is a speculative hand that plays better in late position or against multiple opponents. From UTG, I'm likely to face raises behind me, and I'll be out of position post-flop. The risk/reward isn't good enough to justify playing this hand from this position with my stack size.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the small blind with 5d Td. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 total. I need to call 10 more. My stack is 284 (71 BB). Let me think about opponent tendencies. From the recall, Kimi-K2 has raised preflop 9 times, with varying amounts: 18, 6, 6, 6, 24, 12, 12, 12, 12. So they seem to be raising frequently, with recent raises mostly to 12 (3x BB). This is a standard raise size.\n\nMy hand is 5d Td - suited, but not great. Ten-five suited is a weak hand. I'm out of position (SB) and will have to act first postflop. The pot is currently 18 (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise). If I call 10, pot becomes 28, and I have to play out of position with a weak hand.\n\nThe big blind (Seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) has 123 chips and hasn't acted yet. They could call or raise. Their stack is shorter (30.75 BB).\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I have 71 BB, which is a healthy stack. I should avoid marginal situations out of position with weak hands. 5d Td is not a hand I want to defend from the SB against a raise, even suited. The suitedness gives some potential, but the gap between 5 and 10 is large, making straight potential weaker.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 10 to win 28 (current pot after my call would be 28). That's about 2.8:1 odds, or 26% equity needed. Against a typical raising range, 5d Td has maybe 30-35% equity, so mathematically it might be close. But being out of position reduces my effective odds significantly.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for better spots. I'm not desperate for chips with 71 BB. Let me check if there are any other factors.\n\nI should also consider that the BB might squeeze, putting me in a tough spot. Folding seems correct.",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Board: Jc As Jd (pair of Jacks, Ace high). Our hand: Ts 6s (Ten of spades, Six of spades). So we have a gutshot? Actually board: J J A. We have Ten spade, which gives us a straight draw? No, need QK? Not. We have a backdoor flush possibility (spades: board has no spade). So we have nothing: just high card Ten, not a pair. So we are currently with a weak hand.\n\nPot is 26 chips. Our stack 115, we have 115 total, but we already put 4 (bb) + call 8 = 12? Actually preflop we called 8 (big blind 4 + call 8? Wait: raise to 12 by seat 2, we called 8 to match 12 (since we already have 4 in blind). So we have 12 in pot? The pot after preflop: blinds 2+4=6, plus raise 12 (seat2 adds 12?), seat2 raise 12 means they put 12 total (including big blind?). Usually raise to 12 means total bet 12. So pot: 2 (SB) + 4 (BB) + 12 (raise) = 18? Then call 8 adds 8 (since we already have 4). So pot becomes 26, matches given.\n\nNow flop: Jc As Jd. Opponent seat2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop, now we have flop. We need to decide.\n\nWe have no pair, board is paired Jacks with Ace kicker. Opponent likely has strong hand: maybe AK, AQ, AJ, AA, JJ, or a set? Actually board has two Jacks, one Ace. So opponent could have Jx for trips, or AA for top pair top kicker, or AK for top pair Ace? Wait board: Jc As Jd. So top pair is Ace (if they have Ace). Actually they could have As? But As is on board, so they can't have Ace of spades. They could have Ace of hearts/diamonds/clubs. So they could have Ace high pair.\n\nWe have no pair, no draw. Likely we are behind. We have 0 equity.\n\nWe could consider folding, but we have already called preflop and we have 115 chips, but we might want to try a bluff? However board is paired, a scare card for opponent? Actually Jacks are scary for us but not for opponent. Our hand is weak; a bluff might be possible if opponent is weak and can fold, but we have no fold equity perhaps.\n\nWe need to check if we have any chance to improve on turn/river: we could get a straight? Board: J A J. To get straight we need KQ or QK? Actually need Ten-J-Q-K? We have Ten, so if turn is Q and river K we could make straight? Actually we need Ten-J-Q-K? That's 10-J-Q-K, need also? That's 4 cards; we need 5 cards, we have Ten, board J, we need Q and K and maybe something else. Not promising.\n\nWe could get flush if spades appear 3 more times: we have two spades in hand, need 3 spades on board. Unlikely.\n\nThus best is to check (since amount to call is 0). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since no bet, we can check. Checking is safe.\n\nBut maybe we could raise as a bluff? Minimum raise to 8 (total). That would be 8 into 26 pot, pot odds 26:8 = 3.25:1, we would need equity > 23.5% to be profitable. Our equity is near 0. So not good.\n\nThus we should check.\n\nProvide JSON with action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Actually need 9 to make straight 9-T-J-Q-K? Not possible. Ten with J: we have T, board J J A. The only possible straight is 9-10-J-Q-K, but we need 9 and Q and K. Not there. So no straight draw. We have a backdoor flush draw? Suited spades: board has clubs and diamonds, no spades, so we have 2 spades, could get flush on turn/river if two more spades appear. Not strong.\n\nOur hand is currently just a ten high, no pair, no draw. The board is very strong: top pair Aces, Jacks pair. Opponent seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop to 12 (from SB? Actually seat2 is in SB? Let's see: Seats: 1 Kimi-K2 Thinking (folded). Seat 2 Kimi-K2 - 213 chips. So seat2 is probably SB (since seat3 posted sb 2). Wait preflop actions: Seat3 post_sb 2, seat5 post_bb 4. So seat3 is SB, seat5 is BB. So seat2 is UTG? Actually seat2 raised 12 after seat5 called. So seat2 is probably UTG or maybe CO? Not important.\n\nWe called preflop with Ts6s, which is a weak hand. Likely we are out of position (we are BB, after flop we are first to act).

Need to call 20 to win 66 => 30% equity needed. Our hand likely far less than 30% vs opponent's range.

The action: Seat 1 raised to 6 (3x BB), then Seat 2 (small blind) 3-bet to 18 (9x BB). The pot is 26 chips currently (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 + 18 - but actually let me calculate: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, Seat 1 raised to 6 total, Seat 2 raised to 18 total. So pot is 1+2+6+18=27 chips? Wait, the system says pot is 26 chips. Maybe Seat 2's raise is to 18 total, which means additional 17? Actually Seat 2 posted SB 1, then raised to 18 total, so additional 17. Seat 1 raised to 6 total, which is additional 4 from his position. So pot = SB 1 + BB 2 + Seat 1's 6 + Seat 2's 17 = 26. Yes.\n\nI need to call 16 chips to match Seat 2's bet. My stack is 198, so calling 16 is about 8% of my stack. I have pocket kings, which is the second-best starting hand. However, there's a 3-bet from the small blind after an initial raise from UTG (Seat 1). This could indicate strong hands.\n\nI have no history on these opponents from the tools. They appear to be AI players (Kimi-K2 Thinking, Kimi-K2). Given this is a tournament, I need to consider stack preservation vs. accumulation.\n\nWith pocket kings, I should definitely not fold. I could call or raise. If I raise, minimum raise to is 30 total (additional 12 from the 18 I need to call? Wait, I need to calculate: current bet to me is 18 total. Minimum raise would be to 30 total (18 + 12). My legal actions include raise, so I can raise.\n\nGiven the strength of my hand, I should consider a 4-bet. Standard would be to raise to around 40-50 total. However, I need to consider stack sizes: I have 198, Seat 1 has 194, Seat 2 has 182. If I raise to say 45 total, that's a significant portion of stacks (about 22% of my stack). If I get 5-bet all-in, I would likely call with kings.\n\nBut there's also the possibility Seat 2 has aces. However, with kings, I should be willing to get all-in preflop. The pot is already 26, and raising could build a bigger pot.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: I need to call 16 to win 26, which is about 1.6:1 odds, requiring ~38% equity. Kings have much higher equity against most ranges. Against a range of JJ+, AK, kings have ~70% equity. Even against AA, KK, AK, kings have ~55% equity (but actually against AA only, kings have ~18% equity). But the chance of opponent having aces is low (1/221).\n\nGiven tournament considerations, I want to build a pot with my strong hand. I'll 4-bet to around 45-50 total.\n\nLet me decide: I'll raise to 45 total. That means I put in 45 chips total (I already have 2 in as BB, so additional 43). This is a reasonable 4-bet size.\n\nJSON response.",

Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nI have pocket kings, a premium hand. Seat 2 (SB) re-raised after Seat 1's raise. This is a 3-bet situation. I should consider raising (4-bet) with kings. However, I should think about opponent tendencies. I tried to recall opponent actions but got invalid format. Let me think: I'm in a tournament, stack is healthy. With pocket kings, I want to build a pot. The current pot is 26 chips (1+2+6+18? Let's calculate: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, Seat 1 raised to 6, Seat 2 raised to 18. So pot = 1+2+6+18 = 27? Actually Seat 2's raise includes his SB of 1, so total from him is 18 (includes 1 SB). So pot = 2 (BB) + 6 (Seat 1) + 18 (Seat 2) = 26 chips. Yes.\n\nIf I call 16 more, pot becomes 42.

My stack is 198, so I can afford a sizable raise.\n\nBut I need to consider opponent ranges: Seat 1 raised, Seat 2 3-bet. Seat 2 could have strong hands: AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe JJ. I have KK, so only AA beats me. I should try to get value from QQ, AK, etc. Raising also protects against AA if they 5-bet shove.\n\nI should raise. Let's decide raise size. Minimum raise to 30 total (raise additional 28 from my current 2? Wait: I've already put 2 in BB. To raise to 30 total, I need to put 28 more (30 total). But minimum raise is from 18 to 30 (increase of 12). Actually the rule: minimum raise is the size of the previous raise. Previous raise was from 6 to 18 (increase of 12). So minimum raise is to 30 total (18+12). So I can raise to 30 total, putting in 28 more (since I already have 2). That's a small 4-bet. Might be okay but could invite calls. I could raise larger to 40-50 total.\n\nBut I need to consider tournament strategy: with 99 BB, I can afford to play a big pot with kings. I'll raise to 45 total (putting in 43 more).

Shows they can play aggressively with premium hands.\n- They just called the BB this hand instead of raising, which suggests a weaker hand than KK.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Jh 9s is a marginal hand from the small blind\n- We're getting 5:1 pot odds to call 1 chip (excellent immediate odds)\n- However, we'll be out of position for the rest of the hand\n- The BB (Seat 4) still has to act after us\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- We have a healthy stack (111.5 BB)\n- Early in tournament, can afford to be selective\n- Small blind is a difficult position to play from\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Pot odds are excellent (5:1)\n2. Hand is marginal but playable multi-way\n3. We're out of position\n4. BB could still raise behind us\n5. Stack preservation vs. small investment\n\nGiven the excellent pot odds (5:1) and small investment (just 1 chip to call), it makes sense to complete the small blind.

Suited connectors have good implied odds when they hit, but this is a low suited connector (8-high). From the button against only blinds, this could be a profitable steal opportunity.\n\nFactors to consider:\n1. Position advantage: I'm on button, will act last postflop\n2. Stack sizes: I have 228, SB has 197, BB has 198 - all similar stacks\n3. Tournament: Early stage, 114 BB deep\n4. Hand strength: Low suited connector - needs to hit flop hard to continue\n5. Steal potential: Both blinds have shown folding tendencies\n\nDecision options:\n- Fold: Conservative play with weak hand\n- Call: See flop cheaply with position\n- Raise: Attempt to steal blinds or build pot\n\nGiven the situation, I think raising is the best play. On the button with only blinds left, even a small raise has good fold equity. If called, I have position and can play postflop well. The suited connector has some playability if I hit a draw.\n\nI'll make a standard button raise to 6 chips total (4 chips more, 3x BB).

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop decision with A5s from UTG. I have 231 chips (115.5 BB). The blinds are 1/2, so I'm deep stacked. My hand is A\u26605\u2660 - suited ace with a weak kicker.\n\nFrom UTG (under the gun), this is an early position. A5s is generally considered a weak hand from UTG in tournament poker. With 5 players left to act behind me (MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB), I face significant risk of being raised or playing a multi-way pot with a dominated hand.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from the limited data: they've mostly folded or called in previous hands. No aggressive raises observed yet. However, I have no reads on how they react to UTG opens.\n\nStack sizes: I'm the chip leader with 231, others have 180-197 chips. This gives me some leverage but also means I should be careful not to bleed chips with marginal hands.\n\nTournament considerations: We're deep stacked (115BB), so I can afford to be patient. A5s has some playability postflop due to suitedness, but from UTG it's problematic. The best case is to flop a flush draw or two pair, but I'm often dominated by better aces.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 2 chips into pot of 3 (1.5:1 odds). But if I raise, I'd be putting in more chips with a weak hand.\n\nStandard play here would be to fold A5s from UTG, especially with deep stacks. I could consider a raise to 6-8BB to try to take it down preflop, but that's risky with 5 players behind who might call or re-raise.\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, the prudent play is to fold. I should wait for better spots, especially since I'm chip leader and don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern of opponents folding to raises... Looking at hand #3, everyone folded to my BTN raise with 84s. But that was from button, not UTG.\n\nDecision: Fold A5s from UTG. It's too weak for early position, especially with deep stacks.",

A5 suited has some potential with flush possibilities and ace-high, but it's a weak ace. From UTG, I should be playing tight.\n\nThe players behind me: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2), Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B).

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is in the big blind and hasn't shown aggressive tendencies.\n\nMy hand 5s8d is very weak - off-suit, no connectivity, low cards.

No need to take risks with marginal hands.\n\nPosition is bad - I'll be out of position postflop against the raiser.\n\nBased on opponent history: Seat 2 raised only once before (hand #1 with 18 chips raise from UTG? need to check). Actually, looking at the data: in hand #1, Seat 2 raised to 18 preflop then folded later. So they might have raised with a strong hand that time. This current raise is smaller (6 chips), but still indicates strength.\n\nEasy fold. Let's preserve chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**1. Hand strength:** Qh 9s is a marginal hand from UTG (under the gun). It's offsuit and not particularly strong. Q9o is generally a fold from early position in most poker strategies.\n\n**2. Position:** I'm UTG (seat 3), which is the worst position at the table. I'll have to act first on every street after the flop.\n\n**3. Stack size:** I have 231 chips (115.5 BB) - a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2.\n\n**4. Opponent tendencies:**\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, BB): Has shown some aggression - raised to 6 in hand #1 and hand #8, but folded many other hands. Currently has 192 chips.\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4): Has folded most hands preflop, but showed some postflop betting in hand #5.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, SB): Has 151 chips.\n\n**5. Tournament considerations:** I have a good stack and should preserve it. Playing marginal hands from early position is generally not recommended.\n\n**6. Action:** It's my turn to act preflop. The pot is 3 chips (1 SB + 2 BB). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop.\n\n**7. Pot odds:** I'd be calling 2 to win 5 (3 already in pot + 2 from my call), which is 2.5:1 odds. However, implied odds aren't great with Q9o since it's not a strong drawing hand.\n\n**Decision:** Q9o from UTG is a clear fold in most poker strategies. The hand has poor playability postflop, I'm out of position, and there are still 3 players left to act behind me (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, and Kimi-K2 Thinking in the BB). Even if I call, I'll likely face raises from later positions. Better to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q9o from UTG is a marginal hand that should be folded.

They seem to be getting more active.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, BB) has mostly folded, but called once and raised once in hand 7.\n- I have 231 chips (115.5 BB) - healthy stack.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has only 49 chips (24.5 BB) - short stack.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has 151 chips (75.5 BB).\n\nK7o is a terrible hand from UTG.

This hand has poor playability postflop, especially from early position.\n\nWith 5 players left to act behind me (including the blinds), I'm likely to face raises.

Even if I just call, I'll be out of position against most of the field.\n\nPot odds: need to call 2 into pot of 3 (after posting). That's 2 to win 5 (40% pot odds). My hand doesn't have anywhere near 40% equity against a typical range.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, no need to gamble with marginal hands from bad position.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for better spots.

UTG is the worst position preflop because I have to act first and many players can still act behind me.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, SB) has shown recent aggression: raised to 6 in hand 8, raised to 16 then 58 in hand 9. They seem to be getting more active.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, BB) has mostly folded, but called once and raised once in hand 7.\n- I have 231 chips (115.5 BB) - healthy stack.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has only 49 chips (24.5 BB) - short stack.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has 151 chips (75.5 BB).\n\nK7o is a terrible hand from UTG. It's dominated by any king with a better kicker, and even when I hit a king, I'll often be outkicked. The 7 doesn't help much. This hand has poor playability postflop, especially from early position.\n\nWith 5 players left to act behind me (including the blinds), I'm likely to face raises. The aggressive Kimi-K2 Thinking is in the small blind and could easily raise. Even if I just call, I'll be out of position against most of the field.\n\nPot odds: need to call 2 into pot of 3 (after posting). That's 2 to win 5 (40% pot odds). My hand doesn't have anywhere near 40% equity against a typical range.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, no need to gamble with marginal hands from bad position.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for better spots.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand:** 6s 6c (pocket sixes) in the BB\n**Opponent:** Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) raised to 8 from UTG\n**My stack:** 229 chips (114.5 BB)\n**Amount to call:** 6 chips\n**Pot size:** 11 chips currently\n\nFrom opponent history:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown some aggression: raised to 6 in hand #8, raised to 16 then 58 in hand #9 (3-bet), and bet 50 on flop in hand #9\n- This suggests they can have a wide raising range from UTG\n- They folded in several hands too, so not overly loose\n\nMy hand: Pocket sixes is a medium pocket pair. In the BB facing an UTG raise, this is a marginal spot. The key considerations:\n\n1. **Pot odds:** Pot is 11, need to call 6. Getting 11:6 \u2248 1.83:1 odds, need ~35% equity.\n2. **Implied odds:** If I hit a set (roughly 7.5:1 or ~12% chance), I can win a big pot against an aggressive opponent.\n3. **Position:** I'm out of position (BB vs UTG raiser), which is a disadvantage.\n4. **Stack sizes:** I have 229 chips (deep), opponent has 379 chips. Good implied odds if I hit.\n5. **Tournament considerations:** I'm in good chip position (114.5 BB), can afford to take a speculative call.\n\nThe opponent's raise size is 4x BB (8 total), which is a standard opening size. Pocket sixes has decent equity against a typical UTG raising range (maybe 22-35% depending on exact range).\n\nGiven the pot odds (35% needed) and the fact that I have good implied odds if I hit a set, calling seems reasonable. Folding is also fine since we're out of position with a medium pair. Raising seems too aggressive - we don't want to bloat the pot OOP with a medium pair.\n\nLooking at my hand history: I've been playing fairly tight (folded many hands), so a call here with a pocket pair could be a good way to see a flop and potentially win a big pot.\n\nI think calling is the best play. We get to see a flop cheaply, and if we hit a set, we can potentially stack the aggressive opponent. If we miss, we can easily fold to continuation bets.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket sixes have decent implied odds against UTG raiser.

This is an extremely strong hand. The only real danger is a straight draw (4-5, 5-8, 8-9) or a higher set (77 or 22). But 77 is less likely given the preflop action.\n\n2. **Opponent analysis:** From the data, Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has shown aggressive tendencies:\n   - Hand #8: Preflop raise to 6\n   - Hand #9: Multiple raises preflop (16, then 58), then bet 50 on flop with KK (top set)\n   - Shows willingness to play big pots with strong hands\n   - Won Hand #9 with KK\n\n3. **Position:** I'm out of position (BB), but with a set, I want to build the pot.\n\n4. **Stack sizes:** I have 223 chips, opponent has 379. Pot is 17. I have plenty of chips to play this hand.\n\n5. **Betting considerations:** I'm first to act on the flop. With a set, I should be looking to extract value. Options:\n   - Check: Could induce a bet from opponent who raised preflop\n   - Bet: Build the pot immediately\n\n**Decision:** I have a monster hand. I should bet to build the pot. Given the pot is 17, a bet of around 10-15 chips would be reasonable. Let's bet 12 chips (about 2/3 pot) to start building the pot.\n\nI'll raise to 12 (which means putting 12 chips in total).

The pot is 17 chips and I have 223 chips (111.5 BB). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised preflop to 8 and I called. Now on the flop, I'm first to act (since I'm BB and the preflop raiser is in Seat 1). Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 1 has raised multiple times preflop (hands 1, 8, 9). In hand 9, they showed KK and made multiple raises. They seem aggressive. They have 379 chips.\n\nWith bottom set on a 2h6d7c board, this is a monster hand. The board is relatively dry - no flush draws, straight draws are limited (only 45, 58 for gutshots, and 89 for open-ender). There's some straight potential with 45 or 58, but not many combos.\n\nI want to build the pot. Since I'm first to act, I should consider my options:\n1. Check - could induce a bet from the preflop raiser\n2. Bet/raise - build the pot with my strong hand\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive tendencies and the fact they raised preflop, they might continuation bet. However, with bottom set, I want to get value. A check-raise could work well here. But I need to think about stack sizes: I have 223, opponent has 379. The pot is 17. If I check and they bet, I can check-raise.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions: I can check or raise. If I check now, I can check-raise if they bet. That might be optimal to get more chips in. But if they check behind, I lose value. However, given their aggressive preflop raising, they're likely to continuation bet.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (111.5 BB), but this is a monster hand. I should maximize value.\n\nI'll check to induce a bet from the aggressive opponent, then raise. This is standard with sets in position against aggressive players.\n\nWait, I'm out of position actually - I'm BB, they're in Seat 1 (which appears to be UTG? Actually seats: 1, 2, 3(me), 4, 5). So I'm BB, they're UTG. I'm out of position. That makes checking even more reasonable.\n\nDecision: Check to induce a bet, then raise. But I need to make an action now. I'll check.",

I need to call 10.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been aggressive preflop with raises (hand 8: raise 6, hand 9: raise 16 then 58). On the flop in hand 9, they bet 50 then called 50. So they seem capable of continuation betting and calling raises.\n\nWith bottom set on a 2-6-7 board, I'm crushing most of their range. They could have overpairs (88-AA), overcards (AK, AQ), maybe some draws (45, 89), or other hands. The board is relatively dry - no flush draws, only straight draws are 45 and 89.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 10 to win 37 (27 + 10). That's about 3.7:1 odds, requiring only ~27% equity. I have way more than that.\n\nGiven my strong hand, I should raise. The minimum raise is to 20 total (10 more). But I should consider a larger raise to build the pot and charge draws. My stack is 223, opponent has 369. The pot is 27.\n\nIf I raise to say 30-40, that would be a good sizing. But let me think: I want to get value from overpairs and draws. A raise to 30-35 seems reasonable. Actually, looking at stack sizes: I have 223, opponent has 369. If I raise to say 40, that's 30 more for opponent to call, pot would be 77, leaving me with 183 behind.\n\nBut wait, I should check if I have any history with this opponent on similar boards.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3d Th - This is a very weak hand. T3 offsuit is one of the worst possible starting hands. It has almost no playability post-flop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN, which is great position, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n3. **Opponent behavior**: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 8 (4x BB). Looking at their history, they've folded preflop in most recent hands (Hands 6-11 all folded preflop). In Hand #5, they raised preflop to 4 (2x BB). So this is only the second time they've raised preflop. This might indicate a stronger hand than their usual range.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 11 chips (SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 8). I need to call 7 to win 11, which gives me ~1.57:1 pot odds (about 39% equity needed). With T3o, I have nowhere near that equity against a raising range.\n\n5. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 249 chips (124.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has 143 chips (71.5 BB)\n   - MiniMax-M2 has only 47 chips (23.5 BB) in the BB - very short stack\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a good stack and should preserve it. Calling with T3o would be speculative at best and likely burning chips.\n\n7. **Additional factors**: The short stack in the BB (MiniMax-M2) might be forced to go all-in with many hands given their stack size of only 47 chips. If they shove, the pot gets bigger but I'd still have a terrible hand.\n\nGiven that:\n- My hand is extremely weak (T3o)\n- I need ~39% equity but likely have <20% against a raising range\n- Opponent has shown some aggression (raised preflop)\n- I have position but hand is too weak to leverage it\n- Better to preserve my stack for better spots\n\nThe correct play is to fold. Even though I'm on the button, T3o is simply not playable for a raise, especially when I'd be out of position relative to the raiser (they act after me post-flop).\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"T3o is too weak to call a 4x raise. Need ~39% equity but have <20% against raising range. Opponent has shown recent aggression. Better to preserve stack for better spots.\"\n}",

Currently has a short stack of 46 chips.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been folding frequently (8/10 times), but raised in the last hand (hand #12) to 8 chips. Currently has 152 chips.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - My stack: 249 chips (124.5 BB) - healthy\n   - SB (Seat 4): 46 chips (23 BB) - short stack\n   - BB (Seat 5): 152 chips (76 BB)\n\n5. **Situation**: Both players ahead of me have folded. I'm facing the SB (1 chip) and BB (2 chips). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop. The pot is 3 chips currently.\n\nFrom the button with A9o, this is a standard open-raise spot. The SB has a very short stack and might be forced to defend with a wide range. The BB has been folding a lot but just raised last hand, so might be getting more active.\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, I should raise to take initiative. A standard raise would be 2.5-3x the BB, so 5-6 chips total. Let me raise to 6 chips total (4 more chips on top of the 2 to call).\n\nThis puts pressure on the short-stacked SB and tests the BB who has been folding frequently. If either player calls, I have position advantage postflop with an Ace-high hand that could improve to top pair.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 6,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Standard button raise with A9o.

Now on the flop, they checked to me. I have middle pair with ace kicker, which is a decent hand on this dry board. The board is low cards with no obvious draws (no flush draws, straight draws possible with 6-8 but not likely). \n\nLooking at opponent's history: they've been folding a lot preflop (7 of 10 actions), raised once preflop in hand #5 and once in hand #12. They called my preflop raise this hand. Their stack is 148 chips (74 BB), which is smaller than my 243 chips. \n\nI should consider betting for value with top pair. The pot is 13 chips. I could check behind to see a turn card, but betting seems better to get value from worse hands like lower pairs or draws. The minimum raise is 4, but I could bet around 8-10 chips (half to 3/4 pot). \n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to fold often, they might fold to a continuation bet. But they called preflop, so they likely has some hand. I have position advantage being on the button.\n\nI think a moderate bet is good here. Let's say 9 chips (about 2/3 pot). This builds the pot while not committing too much.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 15,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Middle pair with ace kicker on dry board.

From UTG, this is typically a fold in most poker strategies.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (worst position at the table) - We'll have to act first on all postflop streets, which is a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Stack**: 256 chips (128 BB) - We have a deep stack, so no immediate pressure to accumulate chips.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): 367 chips - Seems aggressive based on past hands (raised in hand 8, 9, 11)\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 46 chips - Very short stack (23 BB)\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 147 chips\n\n5. **Action so far**: Only blinds posted, Seat 2 folded. We're first to act.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 128 BB, we can afford to be patient and wait for better spots. J8s from UTG is marginal at best.\n\nLooking at past hands:\n- I've folded from UTG position twice before (hand 5 and 10) with weak hands\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown aggression\n- MiniMax-M2 is very short and might be looking to push\n\nPoker strategy considerations:\n- J8s from UTG is a clear fold in most tournament strategies\n- Even if we call, we'll likely face raises from later positions\n- Suited connectors need good implied odds, but from UTG with deep stacks behind, we could get raised and have to fold\n- The pot odds are 3:2 (calling 2 to win 3), but we need much better implied odds for this hand\n\nDecision: **Fold**. This hand is too weak from UTG position. Better to wait for a stronger hand in better position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Js 8s is too weak from UTG position.

The blinds are 1/2.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, 366 chips): Has been folding a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop). Shows some aggression when they do play (raised to 8 in hand 11, bet 10 on flop).\n2. Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, 178 chips): Has folded a lot too (last 4 hands folded preflop). Showed one raise to 6 in hand 7.\n3. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, 49 chips): Short stack (24.5 BB). Has shown some aggression - raised to 4 in hand 14, and was involved in a big hand (hand 9) with multiple raises.\n4. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, 147 chips): Mostly folds preflop, raised to 8 once in hand 12, called 4 in hand 13.\n\nAs UTG with J5o, this is an easy fold. The hand has very little potential - no connectivity, no suitedness, and Jack-high is weak. From early position, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand against players who haven't acted yet. There are 4 players left to act behind me who could raise.\n\nEven though it's only 2 chips to call (1 BB), calling with J5o from UTG is terrible poker. I'd be putting money in with a hand that will rarely hit a flop well and will be difficult to play postflop out of position.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for a better spot. With 128 BB, I'm not desperate for chips. I should be playing tight from early position.\n\nGiven the tournament context, I want to avoid marginal spots with weak hands. Fold and wait for a better opportunity."

I have 256 chips (128 BB), so I have a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, 366 chips): Has been folding a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop). Shows some aggression when they do play (raised to 8 in hand 11, bet 10 on flop).\n2. Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, 178 chips): Has folded a lot too (last 4 hands folded preflop). Showed one raise to 6 in hand 7.\n3. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, 49 chips): Short stack (24.5 BB). Has shown some aggression - raised to 4 in hand 14, and was involved in a big hand (hand 9) with multiple raises.\n4. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, 147 chips): Mostly folds preflop, raised to 8 once in hand 12, called 4 in hand 13.\n\nAs UTG with J5o, this is an easy fold. The hand has very little potential - no connectivity, no suitedness, and Jack-high is weak. From early position, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand against players who haven't acted yet. There are 4 players left to act behind me who could raise.\n\nEven though it's only 2 chips to call (1 BB), calling with J5o from UTG is terrible poker. I'd be putting money in with a hand that will rarely hit a flop well and will be difficult to play postflop out of position.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for a better spot. With 128 BB, I'm not desperate for chips. I should be playing tight from early position.\n\nGiven the tournament context, I want to avoid marginal spots with weak hands. Fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

J5o is a very weak hand, especially from UTG (early position). In poker, you should play tight from early positions. With 128 BB stack, not desperate. Better to fold and wait for a better spot. Calling or raising would be bad.\n\nThus, action should be \"fold\". raise_to null. Reasoning: \"J5o is too weak from UTG.

J8o is not a good hand to play, especially from the BB.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, which is the worst position postflop. I'll have to act first on every street.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 6 total (a 3x raise from SB). Looking at their history, they've raised twice before (hand #1 and hand #7). In hand #7, they raised to 6 from SB as well. They've folded a lot (13 out of 16 actions), so they seem fairly tight.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - My stack: 254 chips (127 BB)\n   - Opponent: 172 chips (86 BB)\n   - I have a chip lead\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 8 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 5 raise). I need to call 4 to win 8, so I'm getting 2:1 pot odds (33% equity needed).\n\n6. **Hand strength**: J8o has very low equity against a typical SB raising range. Even against a wide range, it's only around 35-40% equity. Against a tighter range, it's worse.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack and don't need to take marginal spots. Playing J8o out of position against a raise is generally a losing proposition.\n\n8. **Implied odds**: The hand has some potential to make straights or two pair, but being out of position makes it hard to realize that equity. Also, J8o doesn't flop well often.\n\nGiven all this:\n- The pot odds (2:1) require about 33% equity\n- J8o likely has around 35% against a wide SB raising range\n- But opponent seems fairly tight based on their fold frequency\n- Being out of position reduces my effective equity\n- This is a marginal spot at best\n\nBetter to fold and preserve chips for better spots. I have a good stack and can wait for better opportunities.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"J8o is weak, especially out of position against a raise.

Let me analyze:\n\n**My hand:** 2s 7s - This is a very weak hand. 72 suited is one of the worst starting hands in poker. It's only playable in specific situations.\n\n**Position:** I'm in the small blind (SB). This is a terrible position to play from, especially with a weak hand.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- My stack: 253 chips (126.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2): 174 chips - raised to 6\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, BB): 47 chips - very short stack\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Kimi-K2 has raised 3 times out of 16 hands. Looking at the data:\n- Hand #1: Raised to 18 (big raise)\n- Hand #7: Raised to 6 (same as now)\n- Hand #16: Raised to 6 (same as now)\n- Mostly folds preflop (7/10 times)\n\nThis suggests Kimi-K2 is relatively tight but has shown some aggression. The 6-chip raise (3x BB) is a standard opening raise.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 5 more chips to win 9, giving me 1.8:1 pot odds (35.7% equity needed).\n\n**Hand analysis:** 72s has about 30-35% equity against a typical raising range. Against a tight range, it's even worse. Even if I hit a flush draw on the flop, I'm out of position which makes it difficult to realize equity.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have a healthy stack. The BB (MiniMax-M2) is very short (47 chips, 23.5 BB). They might feel pressured to defend their blind or go all-in.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. Terrible hand (72s)\n2. Terrible position (SB)\n3. Facing a raise from a relatively tight player\n4. Short stack in BB could squeeze\n5. Pot odds don't justify calling with such a weak hand\n6. Even if I flop a flush draw, playing it out of position will be costly\n\nThe correct play is clearly to fold. Trying to play 72s from the small blind against a raise is a recipe for losing chips. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"72s is one of the worst starting hands, especially from SB position.

Seems fairly tight/foldy.\n2. **MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB, 46 chips):** Very short stack (23 BB), has been folding most hands, raised once (hand #14 to 4 chips). Short stack may play more aggressively.\n\n**My Position Analysis:**\n- Button is the best position - I act last postflop\n- Two players left to act: SB (short stack) and BB (tight player)\n- Both blinds are relatively short-stacked compared to me\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- K9o is a marginal hand, but playable from the button against blinds\n- Good potential to steal blinds if both are weak\n- Suited would be better, but offsuit still has some value in position\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 126.5 BB, healthy stack\n- SB has only 23 BB, may be looking to shove with decent hands\n- BB has 72.5 BB, more room to maneuver\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that:\n1. I'm on the button with position advantage\n2. Both blinds have shown tendency to fold frequently\n3. K9o has decent high card value against random blinds\n4. A raise could potentially win the pot preflop\n5. Even if called, I have position advantage postflop\n\nI should raise to apply pressure and potentially win the blinds. A standard raise to 6 chips (3x BB) seems appropriate.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 6,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Button position with K9o against two blinds who have been folding frequently.

It has very little potential to make strong hands postflop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB (small blind), which is the worst position at the table. I'll be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n3. **Action so far**: \n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8 (2x BB)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) 3-bet to 24 (6x BB)\n\n4. **Stack sizes**:\n   - My stack: 252 chips (63 BB)\n   - Seat 2: 157 chips (39 BB) \n   - Seat 5: 139 chips (35 BB)\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is currently 36 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 8 + 3-bet 24 - my BB 4 already in). I need to call 20 to win 56 (36 + 20). That's about 2.8:1 pot odds, or ~26% equity needed.\n\n6. **Hand analysis**: 6-3o has maybe 20-25% equity against a typical 3-betting range. But we're in terrible position with a hand that plays poorly postflop. Even if we hit a pair, we're often dominated.\n\n7. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has mostly folded preflop, but raised twice in recent hands (hands 16 and 17). This 3-bet is aggressive.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has mostly folded preflop, but called once and bet once postflop.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (63 BB). No need to gamble with trash hands. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n9. **Additional factors**: Seat 5 still has to act after me. If I call, they might 4-bet or call, creating a multiway pot with a terrible hand out of position.\n\nThe math doesn't justify calling. Even with decent pot odds, 6-3o is just too weak. We'll be playing a big pot out of position with a hand that rarely improves to anything strong. Folding is clearly correct.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"6-3o is one of the worst starting hands.

          "content": "Let me analyze the situation. I have pocket 7s in the small blind. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 total (3x BB). Looking at their preflop raising history: they've raised various amounts: 18, 6, 6, 6, and most recently 24. So they have a wide raising range.\n\nI have 250 chips (62.5 BB). The pot is 18 (2 SB, 4 BB, 12 raise). I need to call 10 more. That's 4% of my stack. Pocket 7s is a medium pocket pair - decent hand but vulnerable to overcards.\n\nFactors to consider:\n1.

The pot is 18 (2 SB, 4 BB, 12 raise). I need to call 10 more. That's 4% of my stack. Pocket 7s is a medium pocket pair - decent hand but vulnerable to overcards.\n\nFactors to consider:\n1. Position: I'm out of position (SB) vs the raiser (seat 2). This is a disadvantage.\n2. Stack sizes: My stack is 250, opponent has 181. The BB has only 42 chips and could be forced all-in.\n3.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this hand. We're in the BB with pocket 7s. The board is 9d Jh 2s. We're heads-up against Kimi-K2 who raised preflop to 12 (3x BB). We called from the BB.\n\nNow on the flop, we have first action (since Kimi-K2 was the preflop aggressor and we're in position relative to them on this street? Wait, actually Kimi-K2 is in Seat 2, we're in Seat 3 (BB). So Kimi-K2 is to our right, meaning they act before us. But the prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\" and we have legal actions fold, check, raise. That means it's our turn to act and there's no bet to call, so Kimi-K2 must have checked. So Kimi-K2 checked the flop to us.\n\nWe have middle pair with 7s on a 9d Jh 2s board. This is a decent flop for our hand - we have middle pair, no overcards to our 7s except the 9 and J. The board is relatively dry with no flush draws (two hearts but we have one heart). There's a possible straight draw with T8 or QTs type hands, but not many.\n\nKimi-K2's preflop raise history shows they've been folding a lot (7 out of 10 hands), but raised 3 times: hand 16 (raise 6), hand 17 (raise 6), and hand 21 (raise 24). So they seem to be raising with a wide range when they do play, but mostly folding. The raise to 24 in hand 21 was quite large (6x BB).\n\nOur stack is 240 chips (60 BB), Kimi-K2 has 181 chips. The pot is 28 chips.\n\nSince Kimi-K2 checked to us, we have options. We could check back to see a turn card cheaply, or we could bet for value/protection. With middle pair on a dry board, betting could get value from worse pairs (like 55, 66, maybe 88 if they have it) or Ace-high hands. But we need to consider Kimi-K2's likely range.\n\nGiven Kimi-K2's preflop raise, they could have a wide range: any pair, suited connectors, broadway cards. On this 9d Jh 2s board, many of their hands missed. They might have AJ, KJ, QJ, JT, T9, 99, JJ, 22, or overcards like AQ, AK, KQ.\n\nIf we bet and get raised, we're in a tough spot. But if we bet small (maybe 12-15 chips, about half pot), we can get value from worse hands and potentially fold out some overcards.\n\nAlternatively, checking back is safe and keeps the pot small. We have position for the rest of the hand, which is good.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations. We have 60 BB, which is healthy. Kimi-K2 has about 45 BB. We don't want to get stacked with middle pair, but we also want to accumulate chips.\n\nI think a small bet is reasonable here. If Kimi-K2 calls, we can reevaluate on the turn. If they raise, we can likely fold unless we think they're bluffing.\n\nActually, wait - let me check if Kimi-K2 has shown any postflop aggression. Let me search for their postflop actions.",

The pot is 28 chips and it's checked to me on the flop. I have 240 chips (60 BB). My opponent has 181 chips.\n\nWith pocket 7s on a 9d Jh 2s flop, this is a decent flop for my hand. There's no obvious flush draws (two hearts on board but I don't have hearts), and the board is relatively dry. The 9 is higher than my 7s, but there's no overcards to my pair except the J.\n\nI should consider my opponent's range. They raised preflop from UTG+1 position (Seat 2). Their range likely includes strong hands: JJ+, AJ+, maybe KQ, suited connectors, etc. The flop has a J and 9, which could hit their range.\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: only 1 flop action recorded - a fold. Not much to go on.\n\nPot odds: If I check, I give a free card. If I bet, I can get value from worse pairs (like 88, 66, 55, etc.) or try to get folds from overcards. A bet of around 15-20 chips (half pot) would be reasonable.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 60 BB, which is healthy. My opponent has 45 BB. I don't want to get too involved with a marginal hand, but pocket 7s on this board is decent.\n\nI should probably make a continuation bet here. If I get raised, I can consider folding. If called, I can reevaluate on turn.\n\nLet me check if there are any other relevant observations.",

If I bet/raise, I could take it down now. But raising risks getting raised back, and I'm out of position.\n\nLet me think about opponent tendencies. From the recall, only 1 flop action found: he folded on flop in hand #2. Not much data. But preflop he raised, showing aggression.\n\nPot odds: if I check and he bets, I'll need to decide. But now I can check and see what he does. Or I can bet for protection/value with my middle pair.\n\nGiven I'm out of position and have a marginal hand, checking seems reasonable to control pot size and see what opponent does. If he checks back, I get a free turn card. If he bets, I can evaluate then.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 60 BB, healthy stack.

          "content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\nWe're on the turn with pocket 7s. Board: 9d Jh 2s 8h. We're in the BB with 240 chips (60 BB). Opponent Kimi-K2 has 181 chips. The pot is 28 chips. We checked on the flop, opponent checked back. Now it's our turn to act on the turn with amount to call = 0.\n\nOur hand: Pocket 7s. We have a pair of 7s, which is a medium pair. The board has 9d, Jh, 2s, 8h. Our pair is likely not good if opponent has any piece of this board. However, there's a straight draw possibility: we have an open-ended straight draw with 7-7-9-J-8, needing a T for a straight (we have 7, board has 8,9,J, so T gives us 7-8-9-T-J). Also, we have backdoor flush potential with the 7h giving us a heart.\n\nOpponent Kimi-K2 raised preflop to 12 (3x BB) from UTG+1 position. Based on the opponent history I saw, they've been folding a lot preflop (hands 12-15, 18-20), but raised in hands 16, 17, and 21. So they seem to raise with premium hands. Their check on the flop suggests they might not have connected strongly or are playing cautiously.\n\nGiven the pot is only 28 chips and we have position (we act first on this street), we have several options:\n\n1. Check: See a free river card. This is reasonable since we have a draw to a straight and our pair might be good if opponent missed.\n2. Bet: Try to take down the pot now with a semi-bluff, representing a hand like a 9, J, or straight draw.\n\nOur stack is 240 vs opponent's 181. We have a decent stack. If we bet and get called, we'll have to decide on river.\n\nConsidering opponent's tendencies: They've raised preflop but checked flop. They might have a medium pocket pair (TT, QQ?), AK/AQ that missed, or maybe a hand like AT, KT. Their check suggests weakness.\n\nI think a small bet could be good here. We can represent a hand that connected with the board. If we bet 12-16 chips (about half pot), we can get folds from hands that missed. If called, we still have outs on river.\n\nActually, let me think about pot odds and implied odds. If we bet 14 chips into 28, we're risking 14 to win 28 (2:1). If we get called, pot becomes 56, and we'd have to decide on river.\n\nBut actually, we're first to act on turn. We could check and see what opponent does. If they bet, we'd have to decide whether to call based on pot odds. Checking seems safer.\n\nHowever, with our straight draw and pair, we have some equity. Let's estimate: We have 8 outs to a straight (four Ts), maybe 2 outs to improve our pair (two remaining 7s). That's 10 outs, about 20% equity to improve by river. But our pair might already be best.\n\nGiven opponent checked flop after raising preflop, they likely have a hand like AK, AQ, KQ, or medium pocket pair that didn't improve. They might fold to a bet.\n\nI think a small bet is good here. Let's say bet 12 chips (less than half pot). This puts pressure on opponent while not risking too much.\n\nWait, but we need to consider tournament implications. We have 60 BB, which is healthy. No need to take big risks. But also, we want to accumulate chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The board is somewhat coordinated with straight draws possible (T would complete a straight for any hand with a 7 or Q). Our 7s are vulnerable. If opponent has a hand like AT, KT, QT, they have a pair plus straight draw. If they have a pair like 99, JJ, they have us crushed.\n\nGiven the information, I think checking is reasonable to realize our equity cheaply. If we check and opponent bets, we can evaluate then.\n\nBut actually, we have position (we act first this street, but opponent acts last overall). Hmm, we're in BB, opponent is UTG+1. On turn, we act first. So if we check, opponent can bet.\n\nI think checking is fine. We get to see a river card for free, and if opponent bets, we can decide based on bet size.\n\nLet's check."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\nWe're on the turn with pocket 7s. Board: 9d Jh 2s 8h. We're in the BB with 240 chips (60 BB). Opponent Kimi-K2 has 181 chips. The pot is 28 chips. We checked on the flop, opponent checked back. Now it's our turn to act on the turn with amount to call = 0.\n\nOur hand: Pocket 7s. We have a pair of 7s, which is a medium pair. The board has 9d, Jh, 2s, 8h. Our pair is likely not good if opponent has any piece of this board. However, there's a straight draw possibility: we have an open-ended straight draw with 7-7-9-J-8, needing a T for a straight (we have 7, board has 8,9,J, so T gives us 7-8-9-T-J). Also, we have backdoor flush potential with the 7h giving us a heart.\n\nOpponent Kimi-K2 raised preflop to 12 (3x BB) from UTG+1 position. Based on the opponent history I saw, they've been folding a lot preflop (hands 12-15, 18-20), but raised in hands 16, 17, and 21. So they seem to raise with premium hands. Their check on the flop suggests they might not have connected strongly or are playing cautiously.\n\nGiven the pot is only 28 chips and we have position (we act first on this street), we have several options:\n\n1. Check: See a free river card. This is reasonable since we have a draw to a straight and our pair might be good if opponent missed.\n2. Bet: Try to take down the pot now with a semi-bluff, representing a hand like a 9, J, or straight draw.\n\nOur stack is 240 vs opponent's 181. We have a decent stack. If we bet and get called, we'll have to decide on river.\n\nConsidering opponent's tendencies: They've raised preflop but checked flop. They might have a medium pocket pair (TT, QQ?), AK/AQ that missed, or maybe a hand like AT, KT. Their check suggests weakness.\n\nI think a small bet could be good here. We can represent a hand that connected with the board. If we bet 12-16 chips (about half pot), we can get folds from hands that missed. If called, we still have outs on river.\n\nActually, let me think about pot odds and implied odds. If we bet 14 chips into 28, we're risking 14 to win 28 (2:1). If we get called, pot becomes 56, and we'd have to decide on river.\n\nBut actually, we're first to act on turn. We could check and see what opponent does. If they bet, we'd have to decide whether to call based on pot odds. Checking seems safer.\n\nHowever, with our straight draw and pair, we have some equity. Let's estimate: We have 8 outs to a straight (four Ts), maybe 2 outs to improve our pair (two remaining 7s). That's 10 outs, about 20% equity to improve by river. But our pair might already be best.\n\nGiven opponent checked flop after raising preflop, they likely have a hand like AK, AQ, KQ, or medium pocket pair that didn't improve. They might fold to a bet.\n\nI think a small bet is good here. Let's say bet 12 chips (less than half pot). This puts pressure on opponent while not risking too much.\n\nWait, but we need to consider tournament implications. We have 60 BB, which is healthy. No need to take big risks. But also, we want to accumulate chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The board is somewhat coordinated with straight draws possible (T would complete a straight for any hand with a 7 or Q). Our 7s are vulnerable. If opponent has a hand like AT, KT, QT, they have a pair plus straight draw. If they have a pair like 99, JJ, they have us crushed.\n\nGiven the information, I think checking is reasonable to realize our equity cheaply. If we check and opponent bets, we can evaluate then.\n\nBut actually, we have position (we act first this street, but opponent acts last overall). Hmm, we're in BB, opponent is UTG+1. On turn, we act first. So if we check, opponent can bet.\n\nI think checking is fine. We get to see a river card for free, and if opponent bets, we can decide based on bet size.\n\nLet's check.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with the JSON format. Let me first think about the decision without using tools, since the user wants a JSON response immediately.\n\nWe're on the turn with pocket 7s. Board: 9d Jh 2s 8h. Pot is 28 chips. We're in BB with 240 chips. Opponent Kimi-K2 has 181 chips. They raised preflop to 12 (3x), we called. Flop went check-check.\n\nOur hand: Pair of 7s with open-ended straight draw (need T). We have some equity.\n\nOptions: check or raise (bet). Since amount to call is 0, we can check or raise. Minimum raise to 8.\n\nIf we check: We see a free river card. Opponent might bet if they have a hand. If they bet small, we might call with our draw. If they bet big, we might fold.\n\nIf we bet: We could try to take down the pot now. A small bet like 12-16 chips (less than half pot) might get folds from hands like AK/AQ that missed. If called, we have outs.\n\nGiven opponent raised preflop but checked flop, they likely have a hand that missed or medium strength. They might fold to a bet.\n\nBut we're in a tournament with 60 BB. We don't need to take big risks. Checking seems reasonable to realize our equity.\n\nActually, let me think about bet sizing. Minimum raise is to 8 total (4 more). That's very small relative to pot (28). If we bet minimum, it looks weak. Better to bet more like 12-16 if we're going to bet.\n\nBut given our hand strength (pair of 7s might not be good, but we have draw), and tournament considerations, I think checking is fine.\n\nI'll go with check.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the BB with pocket 7s. The board is 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd. The river just came Jd, making the board: 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd. There are two jacks on board, so my pocket 7s are basically a bluff catcher at this point - I have a pair of 7s, but the board has two jacks, so any jack beats me, as do any pairs higher than 7s.\n\nThe pot is 28 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop to 12, I called from BB. On flop and turn, both checked. Now on river, it's my action first. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nLooking at opponent's tendencies: Seat 2 has shown some aggression - raised 3 times out of 10 observed actions (hands 16, 17, 21). But they've also folded a lot (7 times). They raised preflop this hand to 12 (3x BB). After raising, they checked both flop and turn. This suggests they might have missed the flop or have a medium-strength hand.\n\nThe board is 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd. The river brought a second jack. This is a scary card for many hands. If opponent had a jack, they likely would have bet on the flop or turn with top pair. But they checked both streets. If they have a jack now, it's unlikely they just got there on the river unless they had Jx.\n\nMy hand: pocket 7s. This is essentially a bluff catcher. I beat bluffs and worse pocket pairs (22, 33, 44, 55, 66). I lose to any jack, any pair 88+, any straight (T7 or 7T for straight? Actually board is 9-8-2-J-J, so straight would need T7 or 7T, but that's unlikely). \n\nGiven opponent checked twice, they likely don't have a strong hand. They might have missed with AK/AQ type hands, or have a medium pocket pair like TT, 99, 88 (though 99 and 88 would have likely bet for value). TT might be scared of the jack.\n\nIf I check, I likely see a showdown. If I bet, I could get called by worse hands (smaller pocket pairs) or fold out better hands (if they're scared of the jack). But betting here with a weak hand on a paired board is risky - I could get raised, and I'd have to fold.\n\nPot is small (28 chips). My stack is 240 chips (60 BB). Opponent has 181 chips. Tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack relative to blinds.\n\nGiven the paired board and my weak hand, checking seems best. I can win if opponent has nothing, or lose minimally if they have something. Betting risks 8+ chips into 28, and I might get raised or called by better.\n\nI'll check and see what happens.",

When they do raise, they raise to 6 chips in earlier hands (when blinds were smaller) and 24 chips in hand #21. In this hand #22, they raised to 12 preflop (3x BB).\n\nThey checked both flop and turn, then bet 16 on river. The river brought a second J, making the board 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd.\n\n**Hand History:**\n- Preflop: Opponent raised to 12, I called from BB with 77\n- Flop: 9d Jh 2s - I checked, opponent checked\n- Turn: 8h - I checked, opponent checked  \n- River: Jd - I checked, opponent bet 16\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe board is 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd. This gives me:\n- Pair of 7s (weak pair on this board)\n- Possible straight draws that got there: T7 (for 7-high straight 7-8-9-T-J), but I have 77 so no\n- Opponent could have:\n  * A J (trips or full house)\n  * A 9 or 8 (two pair with J)\n  * A missed straight draw (T7, T6, 76, etc.)\n  * A bluff with air\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot before bet: 44 chips\n- Bet: 16 chips\n- Total pot if I call: 60 chips\n- Pot odds: 16/60 = 26.7%\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nI have a pair of 7s. On this board with J-J-9-8-2:\n- I beat: bluffs, lower pairs (55, 66, etc.)\n- I lose to: any J, any 9, any 8, any pocket pair higher than 7s, any two pair, any straight\n- The paired Js reduce combos of Jx hands somewhat, but still many possible\n\n**Opponent Betting Pattern:**\nOpponent raised preflop, checked flop and turn, then bet river. This could be:\n1. Value bet with a J (slow-playing trips)\n2. Value bet with a 9 or 8 (two pair)\n3. Bluff with missed draw (T7, 76, etc.)\n4. Bluff with air trying to take it down\n\nGiven opponent's tight preflop tendencies (mostly folding), their raising range is likely stronger. They raised to 12 preflop (3x), which is a standard raise size.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 240 chips (60 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent has 165 chips (41 BB)\n- Pot is 44 chips (11 BB)\n- Call costs 16 chips (4 BB)\n\n**Decision:**\nI'm getting 26.7% pot odds. My hand likely needs to be good ~27% of the time to call. With a pair of 7s on this board, I'm probably only beating bluffs and maybe some very small pocket pairs that didn't improve. The opponent's checking on flop and turn then betting river looks like they either improved on river (got a J) or are betting for thin value with a medium hand.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight preflop tendencies and the fact they raised, then checked two streets, then bet river, this feels more like a value bet than a bluff. The river J pairs the board, which could make them think their J is now full house or they can value bet trips.\n\nI think this is a fold. The pot odds aren't great and my hand is weak on this board. Better to preserve my stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pair of 7s is weak on J-J-9-8-2 board. Opponent raised preflop, checked flop and turn, then bet river - pattern suggests value betting a J or two pair. Getting 26.7% pot odds but likely have less than 20% equity against opponent's range. Opponent is tight preflop (14/20 folds), suggesting strong raising range. Better to preserve stack.\"\n"

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My hand: 7h 7s (pair of sevens)\n- Board: 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd (paired board with J's, possible straight draws)\n- Pot: 44 chips\n- Bet to call: 16 chips\n- My stack: 240 chips (60 BB)\n- Opponent stack: 165 chips (seat 2)\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Kimi-K2 in seat 2):**\nFrom the recall data, opponent has been mostly folding preflop (14/20 actions are folds). When they do raise, they raise to 6 chips in earlier hands (when blinds were smaller) and 24 chips in hand #21. In this hand #22, they raised to 12 preflop (3x BB).\n\nThey checked both flop and turn, then bet 16 on river. The river brought a second J, making the board 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd.\n\n**Hand History:**\n- Preflop: Opponent raised to 12, I called from BB with 77\n- Flop: 9d Jh 2s - I checked, opponent checked\n- Turn: 8h - I checked, opponent checked  \n- River: Jd - I checked, opponent bet 16\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe board is 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd. This gives me:\n- Pair of 7s (weak pair on this board)\n- Possible straight draws that got there: T7 (for 7-high straight 7-8-9-T-J), but I have 77 so no\n- Opponent could have:\n  * A J (trips or full house)\n  * A 9 or 8 (two pair with J)\n  * A missed straight draw (T7, T6, 76, etc.)\n  * A bluff with air\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot before bet: 44 chips\n- Bet: 16 chips\n- Total pot if I call: 60 chips\n- Pot odds: 16/60 = 26.7%\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nI have a pair of 7s. On this board with J-J-9-8-2:\n- I beat: bluffs, lower pairs (55, 66, etc.)\n- I lose to: any J, any 9, any 8, any pocket pair higher than 7s, any two pair, any straight\n- The paired Js reduce combos of Jx hands somewhat, but still many possible\n\n**Opponent Betting Pattern:**\nOpponent raised preflop, checked flop and turn, then bet river. This could be:\n1. Value bet with a J (slow-playing trips)\n2. Value bet with a 9 or 8 (two pair)\n3. Bluff with missed draw (T7, 76, etc.)\n4. Bluff with air trying to take it down\n\nGiven opponent's tight preflop tendencies (mostly folding), their raising range is likely stronger. They raised to 12 preflop (3x), which is a standard raise size.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 240 chips (60 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent has 165 chips (41 BB)\n- Pot is 44 chips (11 BB)\n- Call costs 16 chips (4 BB)\n\n**Decision:**\nI'm getting 26.7% pot odds. My hand likely needs to be good ~27% of the time to call. With a pair of 7s on this board, I'm probably only beating bluffs and maybe some very small pocket pairs that didn't improve. The opponent's checking on flop and turn then betting river looks like they either improved on river (got a J) or are betting for thin value with a medium hand.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight preflop tendencies and the fact they raised, then checked two streets, then bet river, this feels more like a value bet than a bluff. The river J pairs the board, which could make them think their J is now full house or they can value bet trips.\n\nI think this is a fold. The pot odds aren't great and my hand is weak on this board. Better to preserve my stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pair of 7s is weak on J-J-9-8-2 board.

Playable in position but not strong.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN) - excellent position, which gives me advantage postflop.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 240 chips (60 BB)\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking: 357 chips (raiser from UTG)\n   - MiniMax-M2: 40 chips (short stack, in SB)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B: 135 chips (in BB)\n\n4. **Action**: Kimi-K2 Thinking raised to 12 from UTG (3x BB). This is a standard raise. Looking at opponent history:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised twice before (hands 15 and 20, both 6 chips). This 12 chip raise is larger.\n   - MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot (9 of last 10 hands)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been mostly folding but raised once in hand 21\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 12). I need to call 12 to win 30 (18+12). That's 2.5:1 pot odds, or 29% equity needed.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy 60 BB stack. Q9s is a speculative hand that plays well in position but is dominated by UTG raising ranges. UTG raises typically represent strong hands (top 15-20% of hands).\n\n7. **Additional factors**: There are two players left to act (SB and BB). SB is very short-stacked (10 BB) and may shove. BB might also call or raise.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Q9s has decent implied odds if I hit a flush or straight, but I'm out of position relative to the raiser.\n- UTG raises are typically strong, so I'm likely behind.\n- With 60 BB, I can afford to fold speculative hands.\n- The pot odds (29% equity needed) are borderline - Q9s vs a typical UTG range has about 30-35% equity, but that's close.\n\nHowever, my position on the button is excellent. If I call, I'll have position on everyone postflop. But the short stack in SB could shove, changing dynamics.\n\nGiven tournament preservation and that this is a marginal spot with a hand that can get me into trouble, I think folding is prudent. Better to wait for stronger spots in position.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm UTG with 6c4c, which is a weak hand - suited connectors but low cards. My stack is 240 chips (60 BB). The blinds are 2/4. Seat 5 (SB) posted 2, Seat 1 (BB) posted 4, and Seat 2 folded. So it's my action with 4 to call.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking, BB, 371 chips): Has raised preflop in 4 of 10 hands, including a raise to 12 last hand. Seems aggressive when they play.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2, 40 chips): Has folded 9 of last 10 hands, only raised once in hand 14. Very tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B, SB, 133 chips): Has folded 7 of 10 hands, called once, raised once, bet once on flop. Somewhat tight but capable of aggression.\n\nMy position is UTG - worst position at the table. With 6c4c, this is a clear fold from UTG. Suited connectors play better in later positions with more players to potentially call. From UTG, I'd be opening with this weak hand into 4 players left to act, including an aggressive BB.\n\nMy stack is healthy at 60 BB, no need to gamble with marginal hands from early position. Better to wait for stronger spots.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 4 into pot of 6, so getting 1.5:1 odds, but implied odds with suited connectors could be decent if I hit a flush or straight. However, position is terrible and I'll be out of position post-flop against potentially multiple opponents.\n\nTournament considerations: Preserving stack is important. No need to play marginal hands from early position.\n\nDecision: Fold. This is standard poker - fold weak suited connectors from UTG.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**My hand:** 7d 2h - This is an extremely weak hand, one of the worst possible starting hands in poker.\n\n**Position:** SB (small blind). I've already posted 2 chips, need to call 2 more to see the flop.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- Me: 240 chips (60 BB)\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): 195 chips - just called\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 60 chips (15 BB) - will be in BB\n\n**Pot:** Currently 10 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 4 call)\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): From recent hands, seems to play some hands. Called 4 in hand 25, raised to 12 in hand 22. Not overly aggressive.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has been folding a lot but raised twice in recent hands (hands 24 and 25). Has a very short stack of 60 chips (15 BB).\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 60 BB, which is a healthy stack. Seat 4 is very short (15 BB) and could be looking to shove or play aggressively.\n\n**Hand analysis:** 7d 2h is trash. Even with the small price of 2 chips (completing the SB), this hand has almost no potential. It's offsuit, low cards, no straight potential. The only reason to play would be if I thought I could outplay opponents postflop, but with such a weak hand, I'll be dominated most of the time.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 12 chips (after my call). That's 6:1 pot odds, which is good mathematically. However, implied odds are poor because:\n1. I'm out of position (SB)\n2. My hand is terrible\n3. I'll likely face aggression from the BB who has a short stack\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. Even though it's only 2 chips, playing 7-2 offsuit from the small blind is a recipe for losing more chips postflop. With a healthy stack of 60 BB, I should preserve it for better spots.\n\n**Alternative considerations:** If I had a stronger hand or better position, calling might be okay. But with this trash hand, fold is correct.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns with Seat 4's short stack play.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the small blind with 7d 2h, which is an extremely weak hand. My stack is 240 chips (60 BB). The big blind is MiniMax-M2 with only 60 chips (15 BB) - they're short stacked. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has called the big blind of 4. I need to call 2 more to complete the small blind.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 (BB) has been active - they raised preflop in hands 24 and 25. They're short stacked and likely to play aggressively. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) just called, which could indicate a medium-strength hand.\n\nWith 7d 2h, this is one of the worst possible hands. Even with just 2 chips to call, the hand is so weak that it's not worth playing, especially with a short-stacked BB who might squeeze. The pot is only 10 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 4 call).\n\nGiven my position (SB), I'll have to act first on every post-flop street, which is a huge disadvantage. The hand has virtually no potential - even if I hit a pair, it's bottom pair with weak kicker.\n\nBetter to fold and preserve my stack. In tournament poker, playing weak hands from the small blind can lead to difficult spots and chip loss. Even though it's only 2 chips, those chips matter in tournament play.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors. The BB is short stacked, so they might go all-in preflop, which would put pressure on me. My hand is not worth defending.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

I also have two overcards (Ten and Nine) which could be good if opponent has middle pair. No flush draws on board.\n\n2. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 with 40 chips total (10 BB). They posted SB (2), called my raise preflop (10 more), and now bet 8 on flop. They have only 20 chips left after this bet (40 - 2 - 10 - 8 = 20). This is a very short stack.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is excellent.\n\n4. **Pot size**: 36 chips before flop bet, now 44 after opponent's 8-chip bet. I need to call 8 to win 44, giving me 5.5:1 pot odds.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, MiniMax-M2 has:\n   - Folded preflop 4 times\n   - Raised preflop twice (hand 24 and 25)\n   - Bet flop once before (hand 25, bet 4 on flop)\n   - Checked flop once (hand 27)\n   - Folded to action once on flop\n\nIn hand 25, they raised preflop (8), then bet 4 on flop. That suggests they might be aggressive with decent hands. However, their stack is now critically short - they have only 20 chips left after this bet.\n\n6. **My hand potential**: With open-ended straight draw, I have 8 outs (four 7s and four Js). That's about 32% chance to hit by river, or ~17% on turn. With 5.5:1 pot odds, I need only ~15% equity to call, so mathematically a call is fine.\n\n7. **Stack sizes**: Opponent has 20 left after this bet. If I call (8), pot becomes 52, and opponent has 20 left. This sets up potential for me to win their remaining chips if I hit my straight. Implied odds are good.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: I have 228 chips (57 BB), which is healthy. Opponent is very short. I should be looking to accumulate chips from short stacks.\n\nGiven opponent's short stack and my strong draw, I should probably raise to put maximum pressure. A raise could get them to fold if they're weak, or commit them if they call. But let me think: if I raise to 16 (minimum), that's 8 more than calling. Pot would be 60, and opponent would have to call 8 more with 20 left. They'd likely call with any decent hand given pot odds.\n\nActually, with their stack so short, they might be desperate and willing to go all-in with many hands. My straight draw is good against most hands they'd have.\n\nI think the best play is to raise. Let me check if I should raise more than minimum. If I raise to say 24 (putting in 24 total, which is 16 more), that would leave opponent with only 12 to call into a pot of 68, giving them huge pot odds. They'd likely call anyway.\n\nActually, given they only have 20 left, any raise essentially commits them. I could just call and see turn, hoping to hit my straight. But raising has benefits: might get them to fold now, or build pot for when I hit.\n\nWait, if they have only 20 left, and I raise to say 20 (putting in 20 total, 12 more), they'd have to call 12 into pot of 64 (36+8+20). That's 5.3:1 odds - they'd call with almost anything.\n\nActually, I should consider going all-in? I have 228, opponent has 20 left. If I go all-in, they'd have to call 12 more (20-8 they already bet). That's an overbet, but might get them to fold if they're weak.\n\nBut actually, with their stack so short, they might call with any pair. My draw is good against pairs.\n\nLet me think about what hands they could have:\n- They called my preflop raise from SB. Could have many hands: small pairs, suited connectors, Ax, Kx, etc.\n- Flop is 5c 6s 8h. They bet 8 into 36. This could be:\n  * A pair (maybe 7x, 9x, Tx, etc.)\n  * A draw (like 7x for open-ended, or flush draw - but no flush possible"

But raising has benefits: might get them to fold now, or build pot for when I hit.\n\nWait, if they have only 20 left, and I raise to say 20 (putting in 20 total, 12 more), they'd have to call 12 into pot of 64 (36+8+20). That's 5.3:1 odds - they'd call with almost anything.\n\nActually, I should consider going all-in? I have 228, opponent has 20 left. If I go all-in, they'd have to call 12 more (20-8 they already bet). That's an overbet, but might get them to fold if they're weak.\n\nBut actually, with their stack so short, they might call with any pair. My draw is good against pairs.\n\nLet me think about what hands they could have:\n- They called my preflop raise from SB. Could have many hands: small pairs, suited connectors, Ax, Kx, etc.\n- Flop is 5c 6s 8h. They bet 8 into 36. This could be:\n  * A pair (maybe 7x, 9x, Tx, etc.)\n  * A draw (like 7x for open-ended, or flush draw - but no flush possible",

Open-ended straight draw (need 7 or J). Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has 40 total chips, bet 8 on flop, leaving 20 behind. I have 228 chips (57 BB). Pot is 44 after their bet, I need to call 8.\n\nPot odds: 8 to win 44 = 5.5:1 = ~15% equity needed. My straight draw has ~32% equity by river, ~17% on turn. So mathematically call is fine.\n\nBut opponent is very short-stacked. If I call, pot becomes 52, opponent has 20 left. If I raise, I could put pressure on them. They might fold if weak, or commit if they call.\n\nGiven their stack size, any reasonable raise commits them. If I raise to 16 (minimum), that's 8 more for me. Pot becomes 60, they need to call 8 more with 20 left. They'd get 8:60 = 7.5:1 odds, so they'd call with almost anything.\n\nActually, I should consider raising more to deny them proper odds to draw if they have something. But they're so short, it doesn't matter much.\n\nWait, what if they have a pair like 77 or 99? My draw is still good. What if they have a set? Less likely.\n\nActually, I have position and a good draw. Calling seems fine - I get to see turn cheaply. If I miss turn, I can reevaluate. But raising might be better to build pot for when I hit.\n\nGiven tournament context and opponent's short stack, I want to maximize chance to win their chips. If I just call and hit turn, pot will be 52, they have 20 left - I might not get all their chips if they check-fold. If I raise now and they call, pot is bigger and they're more committed.\n\nI think raising is better. How much? Minimum raise to 16 seems fine. Or I could raise more to like 20-24. But with only 20 left for them, any raise essentially commits them.\n\nActually, let me check legal actions: I can raise. Minimum raise to 16. I could also go all-in but that's overkill.\n\nI'll raise to 16 (minimum). That builds pot and puts pressure. If they fold, I win 44. If they call, pot is 60, they have 20 left, and I have good equity.\n\nActually wait, if they have only 20 left after calling my raise (they bet 8, I raise to 16, they call 8 more), they'd have 12 left.

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm on the button with Td 9s. The board is 5c 6s 8h 8d. I have a straight draw (7 gives me a straight with 5-6-7-8-9, and T-9 gives me a pair of tens or nines). Actually, I have an open-ended straight draw: I need a 7 to complete a 5-6-7-8-9 straight. Also, any T or 9 gives me a pair. \n\nThe pot is 60 chips. My opponent MiniMax-M2 has only 32 chips total (he's very short stacked). He checked to me on the turn. He bet 8 on the flop and called my raise of 16 (so he put in 8 more). \n\nLooking at opponent history: MiniMax-M2 has been playing fairly tight - folded preflop in hands 21-23, raised in hands 24-25, then folded in 26, checked in 27. In hand 25, he raised preflop then bet 4 on flop. He seems to be playing aggressively when he has hands.\n\nMy hand is decent with the straight draw and potential pair. The board has paired 8s, which reduces the likelihood he has an 8. My raise on the flop represented strength. He called, which suggests he has something - maybe a pair, a draw, or a weak hand he's floating with.\n\nGiven his short stack (32 chips total), he's likely to call any bet with any decent hand. I have position and a draw. I should probably bet for value and to put pressure on him. A small bet might get him to fold weak hands, but he might call with any piece. \n\nPot is 60, he has 32 total. If I bet 16 (half pot), he'd have to call 16 into 76 pot, getting about 4.75:1 odds. That's good odds for him if he has any draw or pair. But he only has 16 chips left after calling (32-16=16). \n\nActually, let me calculate: He started with 32 chips. He put in 2 SB preflop, called 10 more preflop (total 12), bet 8 on flop, called 8 more on flop (total 28). So he has 4 chips left! Wait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate:\n\nStarting stack: 32 chips\nPreflop: SB 2 + call 10 = 12 invested, 20 left\nFlop: bet 8 (12 left) + call 8 (4 left)\nSo he has 4 chips remaining!\n\nThat's important. He has only 4 chips left. So any bet I make, he's basically pot-committed. He'll likely call with almost anything.\n\nGiven this, I should probably bet his remaining 4 chips to get maximum value. If I check, I give him a free river card. But if I bet, he'll likely call with any piece. My hand has decent equity: I have 8 outs to a straight (four 7s), plus 6 outs to a pair (three Ts, three 9s, though one 9 might be counterfeited if he has a better pair). Actually, I should discount the pair outs somewhat. \n\nBetter to bet small to get value from worse hands. But he only has 4 chips, so I should bet 4 to put him all-in. That's the minimum raise amount is 8, but I can bet 4 as a \"bet\" not a raise? Wait, the legal actions are fold, check, raise. The amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise. Minimum raise to: 8. That means if I want to bet, I have to raise to at least 8 total? Actually, \"raise_to\" is the total amount I'm putting in. Currently I have 0 in this street. So raising to 8 means putting in 8 chips. That's more than his remaining 4.\n\nBut actually, I think I can just bet 4. Let me check: \"Legal actions: fold, check, raise\" - no \"bet\" option. But since amount to call is 0, I can check or raise. To bet, I would need to raise to some amount. The minimum raise to is 8, meaning I need to put in at least 8 chips. That's fine - he only has 4 left, so he can only call 4. So if I raise to 8, he can call 4 more and be all-in.\n\nActually, wait: He has 4 chips. If I raise to 8 (putting in 8 chips), he would need to call 8 to match? No,"

Also potential pair with T or 9. Opponent MiniMax-M2 has only 4 chips left (from 32 total). He checked to me on the turn.\n\nHe bet 8 on flop (into ~28 pot? Let me calculate: Preflop pot was: SB 2 + BB 4 + my raise 12 + his call 10 = 28 chips. Then on flop he bet 8, I raised to 16 total (so additional 8), he called 8 more. So pot after flop: 28 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 52? Wait, that doesn't match pot size of 60. Let me recalculate properly:\n\nPreflop:\n- SB (MiniMax-M2): 2\n- BB (GPT-OSS-120B): 4  \n- My raise: 12 (total)\n- MiniMax-M2 call: 10 more (he already put 2, so total 12)\n- BB fold\n\nSo preflop pot: 2 + 4 + 12 = 18? No, that's not right. Actually: SB 2, BB 4, my raise 12 (total), MiniMax calls 10 more. So total in pot: 2 (SB) + 4 (BB) + 12 (me) + 10 (MiniMax) = 28 chips.\n\nFlop:\nMiniMax bets 8 (pot now 36)\nI raise to 16 total (so I put in 8 more? Actually I need to put in 16 total this street, but I haven't put anything yet. So I put in 16, making pot: 28 + 8 + 16 = 52)\nMiniMax calls 8 more (he already bet 8, needs to call 8 more to match my 16, so he puts in 8 more, pot: 52 + 8 = 60)\n\nYes, pot is 60. He has 4 chips left.\n\nNow turn: He checks. I have option to check or raise. Minimum raise to: 8. That means if I want to bet, I need to put in at least 8 chips. He only has 4 chips, so he can only call 4. The pot would then be 60 + 8 + 4 = 72.\n\nMy hand: Td 9s. I have 8 clean outs to a straight (four 7s). I also have 6 outs to a pair (three Ts, three 9s), but some of these might not be clean if he has a better pair. The board has paired 8s, so if he has an 8, I'm drawing dead to a straight. But he likely doesn't have an 8 given his flop bet/call line.\n\nWhat could he have? He called preflop from SB with short stack. Could have small pairs, suited connectors, maybe A5, A6, etc. He bet flop into me - could be betting a pair, a draw, or bluff. He called my raise - suggests he has something: maybe a pair (5x, 6x), a draw (like 7x), or a weak hand he's floating with.\n\nGiven he has only 4 chips left, he's pot-committed. He'll call any bet with any piece. So I should bet for value. My equity is decent: roughly 8 outs to straight (32% by river), plus some pair outs. Against his range, I might have 30-40% equity.\n\nIf I bet 8 (minimum raise), he calls 4 (all-in). Pot becomes 72. I'm investing 8 to win 72, but I only get 4 from him (the rest is already in pot). Actually, my bet of 8 goes into pot, his call of 4 goes in. So total pot: 60 + 8 + 4 = 72. My investment: 8. So I need 8/72 = 11% equity to break even. I have way more than that.\n\nIf I check, I get a free river card. But I give up potential value from worse hands. He might have a worse draw or weak pair that would call. Given he's so short, I should bet to get his last 4 chips.\n\nBut wait: If I bet 8 and he calls 4, effectively I'm risking 8 to win his 4 plus the 60 pot. So 8 to win 64? Actually: If I win, I get 60 + 8 + 4 = 72, but "

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm on the button with Td 9s. The board is 5c 6s 8h 8d. I have a straight draw (7 gives me a straight with 5-6-7-8-9, and T-9 gives me a pair of tens or nines). Actually, I have an open-ended straight draw: I need a 7 to complete a 5-6-7-8-9 straight. Also, any T or 9 gives me a pair. \n\nThe pot is 60 chips. My opponent MiniMax-M2 has only 32 chips total (he's very short stacked). He checked to me on the turn. He bet 8 on the flop and called my raise of 16 (so he put in 8 more). \n\nLooking at opponent history: MiniMax-M2 has been playing fairly tight - folded preflop in hands 21-23, raised in hands 24-25, then folded in 26, checked in 27. In hand 25, he raised preflop then bet 4 on flop. He seems to be playing aggressively when he has hands.\n\nMy hand is decent with the straight draw and potential pair. The board has paired 8s, which reduces the likelihood he has an 8. My raise on the flop represented strength. He called, which suggests he has something - maybe a pair, a draw, or a weak hand he's floating with.\n\nGiven his short stack (32 chips total), he's likely to call any bet with any decent hand. I have position and a draw. I should probably bet for value and to put pressure on him. A small bet might get him to fold weak hands, but he might call with any piece. \n\nPot is 60, he has 32 total. If I bet 16 (half pot), he'd have to call 16 into 76 pot, getting about 4.75:1 odds. That's good odds for him if he has any draw or pair. But he only has 16 chips left after calling (32-16=16). \n\nActually, let me calculate: He started with 32 chips. He put in 2 SB preflop, called 10 more preflop (total 12), bet 8 on flop, called 8 more on flop (total 28). So he has 4 chips left! Wait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate:\n\nStarting stack: 32 chips\nPreflop: SB 2 + call 10 = 12 invested, 20 left\nFlop: bet 8 (12 left) + call 8 (4 left)\nSo he has 4 chips remaining!\n\nThat's important. He has only 4 chips left. So any bet I make, he's basically pot-committed. He'll likely call with almost anything.\n\nGiven this, I should probably bet his remaining 4 chips to get maximum value. If I check, I give him a free river card. But if I bet, he'll likely call with any piece. My hand has decent equity: I have 8 outs to a straight (four 7s), plus 6 outs to a pair (three Ts, three 9s, though one 9 might be counterfeited if he has a better pair). Actually, I should discount the pair outs somewhat. \n\nBetter to bet small to get value from worse hands. But he only has 4 chips, so I should bet 4 to put him all-in. That's the minimum raise amount is 8, but I can bet 4 as a \"bet\" not a raise? Wait, the legal actions are fold, check, raise. The amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise. Minimum raise to: 8. That means if I want to bet, I have to raise to at least 8 total? Actually, \"raise_to\" is the total amount I'm putting in. Currently I have 0 in this street. So raising to 8 means putting in 8 chips. That's more than his remaining 4.\n\nBut actually, I think I can just bet 4. Let me check: \"Legal actions: fold, check, raise\" - no \"bet\" option. But since amount to call is 0, I can check or raise. To bet, I would need to raise to some amount. The minimum raise to is 8, meaning I need to put in at least 8 chips. That's fine - he only has 4 left, so he can only call 4. So if I raise to 8, he can call 4 more and be all-in.\n\nActually, wait: He has 4 chips. If I raise to 8 (putting in 8 chips), he would need to call 8 to match? No,",

Also potential pair with T or 9. Opponent MiniMax-M2 has only 4 chips left (from 32 total). He checked to me on the turn.\n\nHe bet 8 on flop (into ~28 pot? Let me calculate: Preflop pot was: SB 2 + BB 4 + my raise 12 + his call 10 = 28 chips. Then on flop he bet 8, I raised to 16 total (so additional 8), he called 8 more. So pot after flop: 28 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 52? Wait, that doesn't match pot size of 60. Let me recalculate properly:\n\nPreflop:\n- SB (MiniMax-M2): 2\n- BB (GPT-OSS-120B): 4  \n- My raise: 12 (total)\n- MiniMax-M2 call: 10 more (he already put 2, so total 12)\n- BB fold\n\nSo preflop pot: 2 + 4 + 12 = 18? No, that's not right. Actually: SB 2, BB 4, my raise 12 (total), MiniMax calls 10 more. So total in pot: 2 (SB) + 4 (BB) + 12 (me) + 10 (MiniMax) = 28 chips.\n\nFlop:\nMiniMax bets 8 (pot now 36)\nI raise to 16 total (so I put in 8 more? Actually I need to put in 16 total this street, but I haven't put anything yet. So I put in 16, making pot: 28 + 8 + 16 = 52)\nMiniMax calls 8 more (he already bet 8, needs to call 8 more to match my 16, so he puts in 8 more, pot: 52 + 8 = 60)\n\nYes, pot is 60. He has 4 chips left.\n\nNow turn: He checks. I have option to check or raise. Minimum raise to: 8. That means if I want to bet, I need to put in at least 8 chips. He only has 4 chips, so he can only call 4. The pot would then be 60 + 8 + 4 = 72.\n\nMy hand: Td 9s. I have 8 clean outs to a straight (four 7s). I also have 6 outs to a pair (three Ts, three 9s), but some of these might not be clean if he has a better pair. The board has paired 8s, so if he has an 8, I'm drawing dead to a straight. But he likely doesn't have an 8 given his flop bet/call line.\n\nWhat could he have? He called preflop from SB with short stack. Could have small pairs, suited connectors, maybe A5, A6, etc. He bet flop into me - could be betting a pair, a draw, or bluff. He called my raise - suggests he has something: maybe a pair (5x, 6x), a draw (like 7x), or a weak hand he's floating with.\n\nGiven he has only 4 chips left, he's pot-committed. He'll call any bet with any piece. So I should bet for value. My equity is decent: roughly 8 outs to straight (32% by river), plus some pair outs. Against his range, I might have 30-40% equity.\n\nIf I bet 8 (minimum raise), he calls 4 (all-in). Pot becomes 72. I'm investing 8 to win 72, but I only get 4 from him (the rest is already in pot). Actually, my bet of 8 goes into pot, his call of 4 goes in. So total pot: 60 + 8 + 4 = 72. My investment: 8. So I need 8/72 = 11% equity to break even. I have way more than that.\n\nIf I check, I get a free river card. But I give up potential value from worse hands. He might have a worse draw or weak pair that would call. Given he's so short, I should bet to get his last 4 chips.\n\nBut wait: If I bet 8 and he calls 4, effectively I'm risking 8 to win his 4 plus the 60 pot. So 8 to win 64? Actually: If I win, I get 60 + 8 + 4 = 72, but ",

I have an open-ended straight draw (need a 7). Opponent MiniMax-M2 has only 4 chips left out of his original 32. He checked to me on the turn. Pot is 60 chips.\n\nMy options: check or raise (minimum raise to 8). If I raise to 8, he can only call 4 (all-in). So effectively I'm betting 8 to win his last 4 chips plus the existing pot.\n\nMy hand has decent equity: 8 outs to a straight (four 7s) = about 17% chance to hit on river (8/44 \u2248 18%). Actually 8/46 \u2248 17.4%. Plus some chance my pair outs are good (T or 9 giving me a pair). But those might not be clean if he has a better pair.\n\nHe called preflop from SB with short stack, bet flop, called my raise. What could he have? Possibly a pair (5x, 6x), maybe a draw like 7x, or a weak hand. The paired 8s on board reduce likelihood he has an 8.\n\nGiven he has only 4 chips left, he's essentially pot-committed. He'll call any bet with any piece. So betting is for value. Even if I'm behind, I have decent equity and the pot odds are good.\n\nIf I bet 8 and he calls 4: total pot = 60 + 8 + 4 = 72. My investment = 8. So I need 8/72 \u2248 11% equity to break even. I have at least 17% equity to hit my straight, plus some chance my pair is good or he folds (though he won't fold with 4 chips).\n\nIf I check, I get a free river card but give up value from worse hands. He might have a worse draw or weak pair that would have called.\n\nGiven the math and situation, I should bet. The minimum raise is to 8, which is fine. He'll call 4 all-in.\n\nLet me also consider tournament implications: I have 212 chips (53 BB). He has 4 chips. Winning this pot would give me ~72 chips profit (60 pot + his 4 + my 8 back). Actually, if I win, I get 72 total, of which 60 was already in pot, 4 is his, 8 is mine. So net gain of 4 chips from his stack plus the 60 pot that's already there. Actually careful: If I bet 8 and he calls 4, and I win, I get back 72. My net profit = 72 - 8 = 64. If I lose, I lose 8. So risk 8 to win 64. That's 8:64 = 1:8 odds. I need only 11% equity.\n\nI have more than 11% equity. So betting is +EV.\n\nAlso, if I check and hit my straight on river, I might not get any more value since he only has 4 chips. If I check and miss, I might have to fold if he bets his last 4 (though he'd likely check again).\n\nBetting now gets value. I'll raise to 8 (minimum).

This is a weak hand, especially from UTG position.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (early position) - worst position at the table. We have to act first post-flop against multiple players.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 272 chips (68 BB) - healthy stack\n   - Seat 1 (BB): 365 chips - big stack\n   - Seat 4: 32 chips - very short stack\n   - Seat 5 (SB): 119 chips\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression with raises (hands 20, 23), but mostly folds. Showdown with KK in hand 9.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Mostly folds, one raise in hand 21, one call in hand 25.\n   \n5. **Tournament considerations**: We have a decent stack (68 BB). No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands from early position.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Only 4 chips to call into 6 chip pot (1.5:1 odds). But with 7-5 suited, we're looking for implied odds if we hit a strong hand.\n\n7. **Key factors against playing**:\n   - UTG position with weak hand\n   - Still 4 players left to act (SB, BB, and folded seat 2)\n   - 7-5 suited needs perfect flop to continue (flush draw, straight draw, two pair)\n   - Playing OOP (out of position) makes it hard to realize equity\n\n8. **Key factors for playing**:\n   - Suited connectors can make strong hands\n   - Deep stacks allow implied odds\n   - Could steal if everyone folds\n\nHowever, from UTG with 7-5 suited, this is a clear fold in tournament poker. The hand is too weak to open from early position. Even if we call, we'll be playing a weak hand out of position against potentially multiple opponents.\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger hand in better position. With 68 BB, we can afford to be patient.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"7-5 suited is too weak to play from UTG position.

Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has raised preflop in some hands (Hand 20, 23)\n2. Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has raised preflop (Hand 21, 22), also called (Hand 27)\n3. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Very short stack (38 chips)\n4. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): 119 chips\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- K9o is a weak hand from UTG. It's not a premium hand and should generally be folded from early position.\n- With 68 BB stack, I don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n- There are 4 players left to act after me (Seats 4, 5, 1, 2).\n- The short stack (MiniMax-M2) might be looking to go all-in.\n- K9o has some high card value but is easily dominated by better kings (AK, KQ, KJ) and pairs.\n- In tournament poker, preserving chips is important, especially with a healthy stack.\n\n**Position disadvantage:** As UTG, I'll be out of position for the entire hand if I enter.\n\n**Pot odds:** To call 4 chips into a pot of 6, I'm getting 1.5:1 odds, but implied odds are poor with a weak hand.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a clear fold. K9o from UTG is not playable in a tournament setting with a healthy stack. Better to wait for stronger hands in better positions.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K9o is too weak to play from UTG with a healthy 68 BB stack.

Suited connectors need good implied odds to justify playing, and being out of position makes it harder to realize equity. Additionally, the opponent's raise size (3x) is standard, but we don't have a strong read that they're overly loose.\n\nGiven the positional disadvantage and weak hand strength, I should fold. Better to preserve my stack and wait for better spots, especially since I have a healthy stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"94s is too weak to call from out of position against a standard raise.

With implied odds if I hit a good flop, could be profitable.\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack, can afford to play speculative hands in position.\n\n**Options**:\n- **Fold**: Conservative play with marginal hand.\n- **Call**: Take favorable position with decent pot odds.\n- **Raise**: Could try to steal blinds given tight opponents.\n\nGiven the tightness of both opponents (especially Seat 5 who folds almost always preflop), and my excellent position, I think a small raise could be profitable. If I raise, Seat 5 (SB) will likely fold given their tight tendencies, and Seat 1 (BB) might fold too based on recent folding pattern.\n\nHowever, 98o is not a great hand to raise with from button against only blinds. But with such tight opponents, it might work. Alternatively, I could just call and see a flop cheaply.\n\nActually, let me check: Minimum raise to is 8 chips total (4 more). That's not much - just doubling the BB. If I raise to 8 total (4 more), I'm risking 4 more chips for potential to win 6 chips now.\n\nGiven Seat 5's extreme tightness (folded 9 of last 10 preflop), I think a small raise has good chance of success. Even if called, I have position.\n\nI'll go with a small raise."

This is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**: Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, SB) has raised to 12 total (8 more to call). Looking at their raise history: they've raised preflop frequently (8 times in 34 hands). Their raises vary in size: 6, 12, 18, 24. The 12 raise is on the smaller side. They showed Tc 7d in one showdown, suggesting they can raise with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 268 chips (67 BB), opponent has 231 chips (57.75 BB). Both deep stacked.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 16 chips (4 from me as BB, 2 from SB, 10 raise). I need to call 8 to win 16, giving me 2:1 odds (33% equity needed).\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: We're both deep, so not desperate. I have a comfortable stack.\n\n7. **Alternatives**: \n   - Fold: KJo out of position against a raise isn't great\n   - Call: Reasonable given pot odds and hand strength\n   - Raise: Could 3-bet, but KJo isn't a great 3-bet bluff candidate from BB\n\nGiven the pot odds (33% equity needed) and KJo having ~40% equity against a typical SB raising range, calling seems reasonable. I'm getting good immediate odds, and I have position on the flop (they act first postflop since they're SB). However, being out of position overall is a concern.\n\nLooking at my history: I've been folding a lot (24 folds out of 34 hands). Might be good to defend my blind occasionally with a decent hand.\n\nI'll call and see a flop.",

I have Ks Jc which is a pretty good hand - King high with a Jack kicker. The board shows 5c 9s 8d - all low cards, so my King is likely the high card.\n\nGiven the tournament context and my stack size (260 chips, healthy), I should be playing to win chips. My hand is strong enough to warrant a raise. The minimum raise is 8 chips, which is small relative to my stack and the pot (24 chips).\n\nLooking at my recent history, I've been folding too much (24 folds out of 34 hands) with a 29% win rate. I need to be more aggressive. This hand looks favorable - I have a King high, board has low cards.\n\nI should raise to put pressure and potentially win the pot. Since amount to call is 0, I need to either check (free) or raise (minimum 8). With a good hand like Ks Jc, raising seems correct.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Ks Jc is strong hand with King high, board has low cards (5c 9s 8d).

The pot is currently 18 (2 from SB, 4 from BB, 12 from raise). If I call, pot would be 28.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop in 3 out of 10 hands (hand 31, 35, and now 36). They raised to 12 each time. They've shown down Tc 7d in hand 30, so they're not playing premium hands only.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) in the BB has folded most hands, except one raise in hand 34. They have a short stack of 121 chips.\n\nMy hand Ts 3h is terrible - no suitedness, no connectivity, Ten-high with a weak kicker. I'm out of position (small blind) against a raiser. Even if I hit a Ten, I'm likely dominated. The pot odds are: need to call 10 to win 28, which is about 2.8:1 or 26% equity needed.\n\nWith Ts 3h, I probably have around 25-30% equity against a typical raising range, but being out of position makes it worse. Also, there's still the BB to act behind me, though they've been folding a lot.\n\nIn tournament poker, with 70.5 BB stack, I should avoid playing marginal hands out of position. This is an easy fold. No reason to waste chips with such a weak hand.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. I'm the small blind, so I already have 2 chips invested, but that's a sunk cost. Better to save the remaining 10 chips.",

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (folded last 5 preflop decisions). Only one showdown shows KK (big pair). Seems tight.\n2. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Short stack (111 chips, ~28 BB). Has been folding a lot but showed one raise (hand 34) and one call (hand 36). Currently posted SB.\n\n**My Hand Evaluation:**\n7\u2665 8\u2663 is a speculative hand. As offsuit connectors, it has some potential to make straights but is otherwise weak. On the button with only the blinds to act, this is a reasonable stealing spot.\n\n**Position Advantage:** Being on the button gives me maximum postflop advantage. I can see how both opponents react before I act on later streets.\n\n**Stack Considerations:** \n- I have 70.5 BB, which is healthy.\n- Seat 5 is short (28 BB) and might be looking to defend/play hands.\n- Seat 1 has a big stack but seems tight.\n\n**Tournament Context:** \n- I have a decent stack, can afford to take some risks.\n- Button steals are profitable in tournament poker.\n- With only 3 players at the table (2 opponents), stealing becomes more valuable.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Fold: Safest play, but gives up a profitable stealing opportunity.\n2. Call: Not ideal with 78o - I want to either steal or fold. Calling invites the blinds to see a cheap flop.\n3. Raise: Standard button steal attempt. Should be around 2.5-3x BB.\n\n**Raise Sizing:** Minimum raise to 8 (2x BB) or slightly larger to 10-12 (2.5-3x BB). Since it's just the blinds, a small raise might work.\n\nGiven Seat 1's tight folding tendencies and Seat 5's short stack, a raise has good fold equity. Even if called, I have position.\n\nI'll raise to 10 chips (2.5x BB). This is enough to pressure the blinds while not risking too much."

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (folded last 5 preflop decisions). Only one showdown shows KK (big pair). Seems tight.\n2. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Short stack (111 chips, ~28 BB). Has been folding a lot but showed one raise (hand 34) and one call (hand 36). Currently posted SB.\n\n**My Hand Evaluation:**\n7\u2665 8\u2663 is a speculative hand. As offsuit connectors, it has some potential to make straights but is otherwise weak. On the button with only the blinds to act, this is a reasonable stealing spot.\n\n**Position Advantage:** Being on the button gives me maximum postflop advantage. I can see how both opponents react before I act on later streets.\n\n**Stack Considerations:** \n- I have 70.5 BB, which is healthy.\n- Seat 5 is short (28 BB) and might be looking to defend/play hands.\n- Seat 1 has a big stack but seems tight.\n\n**Tournament Context:** \n- I have a decent stack, can afford to take some risks.\n- Button steals are profitable in tournament poker.\n- With only 3 players at the table (2 opponents), stealing becomes more valuable.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Fold: Safest play, but gives up a profitable stealing opportunity.\n2. Call: Not ideal with 78o - I want to either steal or fold. Calling invites the blinds to see a cheap flop.\n3. Raise: Standard button steal attempt. Should be around 2.5-3x BB.\n\n**Raise Sizing:** Minimum raise to 8 (2x BB) or slightly larger to 10-12 (2.5-3x BB). Since it's just the blinds, a small raise might work.\n\nGiven Seat 1's tight folding tendencies and Seat 5's short stack, a raise has good fold equity. Even if called, I have position.\n\nI'll raise to 10 chips (2.5x BB). This is enough to pressure the blinds while not risking too much.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm on the button with 7h8c. I raised to 10, and the small blind (seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) has raised to 111 total (which is effectively all-in since they only have 2 chips left? Wait, they have 2 chips according to the stack display, but they raised to 111? That doesn't make sense. Let me check: seat 5 has 2 chips according to the player list, but they raised to 111. That seems like a mistake. Actually, looking at the action: \"Seat 5 raise 111\" after I raised to 10. The small blind already posted 2, so they're putting in 111 total, which is 101 more to me. But they only have 2 chips? Something is off.\n\nWait, maybe the stack display is wrong, or maybe seat 5 has more chips than shown. Let me re-read: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 2 chips\" but they raised to 111. That would require them to have at least 111 chips. This is confusing.\n\nLet me think about the pot: blinds 2/4, pot is 125 chips. That includes: SB 2, BB 4, my raise 10, SB's raise 111. That's 2+4+10+111 = 127, close to 125. Maybe there's rounding.\n\nRegardless, I have 78o on the button. I raised preflop, which is a bit loose but positionally okay. Now facing a massive re-raise. The opponent in seat 5 has been mostly folding preflop based on history, with one raise and one call recently. They have 2 chips left (if the display is accurate), so this is essentially an all-in situation.\n\nMy stack is 272 chips (68 BB). I need to call 101 to win a pot of 125+101 = 226? Actually, pot is 125 now, I need to call 101, so pot would be 226 if I call. That's pot odds of 101 to win 226, or about 1:2.2, meaning I need about 31% equity.\n\nWith 78o against a likely strong range from a short stack shove, I'm probably not getting 31% equity. Even against a tight range like {TT+, AK, AQ}, 78o has only about 24% equity. Against a wider range like {22+, A2s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KJo+, QJo}, it's about 32%. But given this opponent has been folding a lot and suddenly makes a huge raise, they likely have a strong hand.\n\nAlso, tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (68 BB), no need to gamble with 78o. Folding preserves my stack.\n\nThe BB folded, so it's just me against the SB. The SB has effectively shoved (if they only have 2 chips, this raise puts them all-in). Even if they have more chips, this is a huge raise relative to the pot.\n\nI should fold. The hand is too weak, the price isn't great, and I'm out of position postflop if I call (actually I'm button, SB is out of position, but still).\n\nLet me check if there's any other info. The opponent in seat 5 raised once before in hand 34 (to 10). That's the only raise I see. They called once in hand 36. Not much history.\n\nDecision: fold.",

Seems capable of aggression.\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2, 241 chips): Has raised preflop multiple times (hands 31, 35, 36). Shows aggression.\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, 345 chips): Mostly folds, but has called SB and bet flop once.\n\nI'm UTG, so there are 4 players left to act after me (SB, BB, and two others). With J4o, this is a clear fold from UTG. The hand has very little potential - it's not suited, not connected, and both cards are low. Even if I hit a J, I'll often be dominated by better jacks. The 4 is practically useless.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (68 BB), so I should preserve it and wait for better spots. There's no reason to play this marginal hand from early position.\n\nPot odds: I'd need to call 4 to win 6, getting 1.5:1 odds, but with such a weak hand and poor position, the implied odds are terrible.\n\nDecision: Fold.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the small blind with 5d Td. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 total. I need to call 10 more. My stack is 284 (71 BB). Let me think about opponent tendencies. From the recall, Kimi-K2 has raised preflop 9 times, with varying amounts: 18, 6, 6, 6, 24, 12, 12, 12, 12. So they seem to be raising frequently, with recent raises mostly to 12 (3x BB). This is a standard raise size.\n\nMy hand is 5d Td - suited, but not great. Ten-five suited is a weak hand. I'm out of position (SB) and will have to act first postflop. The pot is currently 18 (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise). If I call 10, pot becomes 28, and I have to play out of position with a weak hand.\n\nThe big blind (Seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) has 123 chips and hasn't acted yet. They could call or raise. Their stack is shorter (30.75 BB).\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I have 71 BB, which is a healthy stack. I should avoid marginal situations out of position with weak hands. 5d Td is not a hand I want to defend from the SB against a raise, even suited. The suitedness gives some potential, but the gap between 5 and 10 is large, making straight potential weaker.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 10 to win 28 (current pot after my call would be 28). That's about 2.8:1 odds, or 26% equity needed. Against a typical raising range, 5d Td has maybe 30-35% equity, so mathematically it might be close. But being out of position reduces my effective odds significantly.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for better spots. I'm not desperate for chips with 71 BB. Let me check if there are any other factors.\n\nI should also consider that the BB might squeeze, putting me in a tough spot. Folding seems correct.",

They seem to be playing a somewhat aggressive style.\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has mostly folded preflop, with one raise in hand #39 where they raised to 12 then folded to a re-raise.\n\nBeing UTG with 9s8s is a weak position for this hand. Suited connectors need good implied odds and position to play effectively. From UTG, I'll have to act first postflop, which is disadvantageous. The blinds are small (4/8), so calling 8 chips represents about 2.8% of my stack.\n\nHowever, there are several players left to act who could raise, especially Kimi-K2 in Seat 2 who has shown aggression. If I call and then face a raise, I'll have to fold and lose 8 chips.\n\nBetter to fold this hand from UTG. 9s8s is not strong enough to open from UTG, especially with aggressive players behind me. I should wait for better spots with position.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations... Tournament stage? Blinds are still small relative to stacks.

I posted SB 4, opponent posted BB 8, I called to complete, opponent checked.\n\nThe flop is Kd 6s 7h. I have Jh 8s - not a great hand. I have a gutshot straight draw (9-T gives me a straight) and a backdoor flush draw with the spade. No pair, no real equity.\n\nLooking at opponent's tendencies from the recall:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been folding a lot preflop (6 of last 10 actions were folds)\n- Only one raise preflop (hand #37, raised to 111)\n- In hand #40, they called BB, checked flop, then folded when facing action\n- They seem fairly passive/weak\n\nThe pot is 16 chips. I'm in position. My hand has limited equity but some potential. With opponent having only 103 chips (12.9 BB), they're relatively short-stacked.\n\nGiven that:\n1. My hand has some draw potential (gutshot + backdoor flush)\n2. I'm in position\n3. Opponent has shown weakness (lots of folds)\n4. The board is fairly dry (K high, no flush draws)\n5. Pot is small\n\nI should probably take a stab at it with a bet. A small bet might take it down now. Even if called, I have position and can see a turn card. My stack is healthy at 35 BB.\n\nHowever, Jh 8s is pretty weak. Let me think about sizing. Minimum raise is 8 (half pot). I could bet 8-12 chips.\n\nActually, wait - I should consider that opponent has only 103 chips. If I bet and they call or raise, I could be committing myself with a weak hand. But given their passive tendencies, they might just fold.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's stack: 103 chips. If I bet 12 chips (3/4 pot), they'd have to call 12 into a 28 chip pot (2.3:1 odds). That's a reasonable bet.\n\nBut my hand is truly weak. Maybe a check is better? Let me think...\n\nActually, I'm in position with initiative. A bet could win the pot immediately. If I check, I give opponent a free card and they might bet on turn if they have something.\n\nI think a small bet is reasonable. If they call or raise, I can easily fold on turn.\n\nLet me bet 8 chips (half pot). That's small enough to not commit too much but enough to apply pressure.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have more information. Looking at the opponent data:\n\n1. **Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, Seat 1)**: Has raised preflop 5 times in 45 hands. Raises have been small (6-12 chips). This suggests they might not be super aggressive but will raise with decent hands.\n\n2. **GPT-OSS-120B (SB, Seat 5)**: Has raised preflop 5 times including one large raise of 111 chips (hand #37). This is interesting - they have a very short stack (99 chips) and have shown willingness to go all-in preflop. This suggests they might be looking to shove with any decent hand given their short stack.\n\n3. **My recent hands**: I've been folding a lot (30 folds out of 44 hands). Won hand #44 from SB with J8o by calling and betting flop.\n\n**Current situation**: K5s on the button. SB has 99 chips (12.4 BB) and has shown willingness to shove. BB has 325 chips and raises sometimes. \n\nIf I call 8 chips:\n- SB might shove (they have 95 chips left after posting SB)\n- BB might raise\n- I have position but might face aggression\n\nWith K5s, this is a marginal hand. The suited aspect helps but it's still weak. Given the short stack in SB who might shove, and the BB who might raise, calling could put me in a tough spot if there's action behind me.\n\nHowever, I'm on the button with position. If both just check/call, I can see a flop cheaply. If SB shoves, I'd likely fold K5s. If BB raises, I'd likely fold.\n\nGiven my stack (37 BB) and tournament considerations, I think folding is reasonable here. K5s is not a great hand, and while button position is good, facing potential aggression from short stack and BB makes it tricky. I'd rather wait for better spots.\n\nI'll fold.",

They had a small raise in hand 39 but folded to action.\n\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop a couple times (hands 36 and 40), seems somewhat aggressive when they do play.\n\nSeat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Very tight player, mostly folding. In hand 45 they raised to 16 preflop (2x BB) and then bet flop, check-folded turn. They have only 79 chips (9.9 BB) so they're short-stacked.\n\nMy stack: 296 chips (37 BB) - healthy but not huge.\n\nWith J8o from UTG, this is a clear fold. The hand has very little playability from early position. It's suited connectors or high cards that can play well multi-way, but J8o is dominated by many hands and will often be in tough spots postflop. \n\nEven if I limp, there are 3 players left to act who could raise, putting me in a bad spot. Seat 5 is short-stacked and might shove with any decent hand. Seat 2 has shown some aggression.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot, especially since I have a decent stack and don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been playing too tight or loose.",

Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has only 79 chips but hasn't acted yet.\n\nI need to consider: J8o is a very weak hand from UTG. Standard play would be to fold this hand. However, I should think about tournament dynamics. I have 37 BB, which is a healthy stack. The short stack at Seat 5 has only 79 chips (less than 10 BB), which could affect play.\n\nLet me consider if there's any reason to play this hand. J8o has very little potential - it's not suited, not connected. From UTG, I should be playing tight. The pot is 12 chips, I need to call 8 to see a flop. That's 2.7% of my stack.\n\nBut wait, I should check opponent tendencies. However, I can't use tools without proper format. Actually, I should just make a decision based on standard poker theory.\n\nJ8o from UTG is an easy fold. Even if I were in later position, it's marginal. From UTG, definitely fold. The only consideration might be if opponents are very passive or if I have a strong read, but without information, standard play is fold.\n\nAlso, Seat 5 is very short-stacked (79 chips, <10 BB). They might be looking to go all-in soon. My J8o doesn't want to play against potential all-ins.\n\nI should fold. This preserves my stack for better spots.",

Pot is 20 chips. Only opponent is Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) who called. Amount to call is 0, so I can check. Legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nI should think about this hand. I have 7s 5c, which is a very weak hand offsuit. I'm in the big blind, already posted 8 chips. The opponent just called from UTG (Seat 1). They didn't raise. That suggests they have a marginal hand, not premium. But 7-5 offsuit is terrible. Even with pot odds (I can check for free), this hand has very little potential. It's a speculative hand that needs to hit a miracle flop to continue.\n\nGiven my stack size (36 BB), I don't want to get involved with such a weak hand. Even though it's free to check, playing 7-5 offsuit out of position against one opponent is generally -EV. I should just check and see the flop, but folding might be better to preserve my stack for better spots. However, folding would mean giving up my 8-chip blind, which is already in the pot. Since I can check for free, I might as well see the flop and then fold if I don't hit anything.\n\nBut wait, I could also raise. Raising with 7-5 offsuit would be a bluff, trying to take down the pot preflop. But opponent called from UTG, so they likely have some hand. Raising might get them to fold weak hands, but if they call, I'm out of position with a terrible hand.\n\nBetter to check and see a flop. If I hit something like two pair or a straight draw, I can continue. Otherwise, fold on the flop.\n\nLet me check opponent tendencies first using recall_opponent_actions. But I need to output JSON. I'll make a decision based on general principles. Since I can check for free, I'll check. That seems standard.\n\nBut the system says \"Invalid response format\" because I tried to use tools. I should just respond with JSON. Let me think: with 7-5 offsuit in BB facing a limp from UTG, standard play is to check. I'll check.\n\nResponse JSON: action: check, raise_to: null, reasoning: \"7-5 offsuit is weak but checking is free. Will see flop and evaluate.\"",

Their raise amounts vary: 6 (min-raise), 12, 18, 24. They raised to 24 in hand #21. They have shown down Tc 7d in hand #30, which suggests they might raise with marginal hands.\n\nSeat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is in the BB and hasn't acted yet. They also raise frequently preflop (9 times). They showed KK in hand #9.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\nK4o is a weak hand. King-high with a weak kicker. It's not suited, so no flush potential. The hand plays poorly postflop unless we hit a king, and even then we have kicker issues. In position on the button, we have some advantage, but the hand is too weak to call a 3x raise.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 35.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. Seat 5 (SB) has only 87 chips (10.9 BB) and is short-stacked. Seat 2 (raiser) has 227 chips (28.4 BB). Seat 1 (BB) has 357 chips (44.6 BB).\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI should preserve my stack with weak hands. K4o is a clear fold against a raise. Even with position, the hand doesn't have enough equity or implied odds to justify calling 24 chips (8.5% of my stack).\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 36, need to call 24. Pot odds: 24/(36+24) = 24/60 = 40%. We need >40% equity to call. K4o vs a typical raising range has maybe 30-35% equity at best.\n\n**Decision:**\nClear fold. The hand is too weak, and we're not getting good enough pot odds. Better to wait for a stronger spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K4o is too weak to call a 3x raise from early position. Hand has poor postflop playability and kicker issues. Pot odds of 40% require more equity than K4o offers against a typical raising range. Better to preserve stack for stronger spots.\"\n}",

There are two Kimi-K2 opponents (one is \"Thinking\" variant) and GPT-OSS-120B with 87 chips (short stack).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2): Recently raised to 24 preflop in hand 49, and bet 40 on flop. Seems somewhat aggressive.\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1): Mostly calls preflop, sometimes bets postflop.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5): Has raised preflop a couple times, including an all-in raise to 71 in hand 48. Short stack (87 chips) might be looking to push.\n\nMy hand A8o is weak, especially from UTG. Ace-rag offsuit is a fold from early position in most tournament strategies. I have 35.5 BB, which is a healthy stack, so I don't need to take marginal spots.\n\nConsidering position: I'm first to act, so if I call or raise, I'll have to play out of position against potentially multiple opponents. With A8o, I'm dominated by any ace with a better kicker, and it's hard to make strong hands postflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 12 (pot is 12). That's 2:3 odds, but implied odds are poor since I'm out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack relative to blinds. No need to gamble with weak hands from early position. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I've been folding a lot (folded last 5 hands). But that doesn't mean I should play weak hands.\n\nConclusion: Fold. A8o from UTG is not playable in a tournament setting with healthy stack.\n\nWait, let me check if there are any antes or other factors. No, just blinds.\n\nI should fold.",

While pot odds are 2:1, the hand has poor equity and position disadvantage. Opponent has shown aggressive tendencies but folding preserves stack for better spots with 34.5 BB remaining.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in the BB with 9c Td (off-suit nine-ten)\n- My stack: 276 chips (34.5 BB)\n- Opponent (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) raised to 24 total (SB to BB raise)\n- Amount to call: 16 chips\n- Pot: 32 chips (blinds 4+8 + raise 24)\n- Opponent stack: 247 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 9T off-suit is a weak hand. It's a speculative hand that needs help to improve. Not a premium hand by any means.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm out of position (BB vs SB raiser). This is a disadvantage as I'll have to act first on future streets.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** From the recall, Kimi-K2 has been raising preflop frequently (hands 35, 36, 40, 49). In hand #49, they raised to 24 from SB, then bet 40 on flop. They seem somewhat aggressive but not overly wild. They've also folded many hands preflop when facing action.\n\n4. **Pot odds:** Pot is 32, I need to call 16. That's 2:1 pot odds (33% equity needed). With 9T off-suit, I likely don't have 33% equity against a SB raising range. Even against a wide SB stealing range, 9T off-suit has around 40% equity heads-up, but I'm out of position which reduces my effective equity.\n\n5. **Stack considerations:** I have 34.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. Calling 16 chips (2 BB) is 5.8% of my stack. Not huge, but committing with a weak hand out of position is problematic.\n\n6. **Implied odds:** If I hit a good flop (pair, straight draw, two pair), I could potentially win more chips. But 9T off-suit doesn't flop well often, and when it does, it's often second-best hands.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations:** I should be looking for better spots. With 34.5 BB, I don't need to take marginal situations out of position.\n\n**Better alternatives:**\n- Fold: Preserve chips for better spots\n- Raise: Could 3-bet bluff, but with 9T off-suit and out of position, risky\n- Call: Marginal at best\n\nGiven the pot odds are decent (2:1), but the hand is weak and I'm out of position, folding seems correct. The opponent has shown willingness to raise from SB, so they might be stealing, but even against a stealing range, 9T off-suit isn't great.\n\nI should wait for better spots in position or with stronger holdings.",

The only players left to act are the SB (already folded) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B with 79 chips). I have posted SB of 4 chips, and need to call 4 more to complete to BB of 8.\n\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's tendencies from the search:\n- They have raised preflop twice: hand #45 (raised to 16 from BTN) and hand #48 (raised to 71 from SB - huge raise)\n- They've folded many times preflop\n- Their stack is only 79 chips (9.9 BB), so they're short-stacked\n\nMy stack: 272 chips (34 BB) - healthy stack\nOpponent stack: 79 chips (9.9 BB) - very short\n\nWith 2-5 offsuit, this is a trash hand. However, I'm on the button with position, and it only costs 4 more chips to see a flop (pot is 12, I've already invested 4). That's 4 chips to win 12, getting 3:1 pot odds.\n\nBut more importantly, opponent is very short-stacked and could shove any hand. If I call and they shove, I'd have to fold postflop unless I hit something miraculous. 2-5 offsuit has very little potential - needs to hit two pair or better to be confident.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (34 BB) vs opponent's short stack (9.9 BB). I don't need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands. Folding preserves my stack.\n\nLooking at opponent's aggression: They've shown they can make big raises (hand #48 raised to 71 from SB). With only 79 chips total, they might shove any decent hand.\n\nThe pot odds are decent (3:1), but implied odds are poor because opponent is short-stacked. Reverse implied odds are high - I could lose more chips if I hit a marginal hand.\n\nGiven all this, folding is correct. 2-5 offsuit is unplayable even from the button against a short-stacked opponent who could shove.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check the details again.\n\nSeat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 4 chips (according to the player list). But they raised to 87? That would be their entire stack if they only have 4 chips. Actually, looking at the action: \"Seat 5 raise 87\". But if they started with only 4 chips, they can only go all-in for 4. This must be a reporting issue or they have more chips than shown.\n\nWait, let me re-read: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 4 chips\". But they posted SB of 4, so they should have 0 chips left? Actually, if they have 4 chips total, posting SB of 4 would leave them with 0. But they raised to 87, which is impossible.\n\nActually, I think the chip count might be wrong or this is a short stack situation. Let me think about the pot size: Pot is 115 chips. Amount to call is 67. Minimum raise to is 154.\n\nMy stack: 252 chips. I already put in 20, so I have 232 left.\n\nOpponent's raise: They raised to 87 total. They put in SB of 4, then raised to 87, so they added 83 more. If they only had 4 chips total, they couldn't raise to 87. So either:\n1. The chip count display is wrong\n2. They have more chips than shown\n3. This is an all-in situation\n\nGiven that Seat 5 has been folding a lot recently (looking at the opponent actions: folds in hands 46, 47, 49, 50, 51), but raised in hand 48 (to 71) and hand 45 (to 16). So they do raise sometimes.\n\nMy hand: Kc Jd offsuit. This is a decent but not great hand. I'm on the button, which is good position.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 67 to win 115 + 67 = 182. That's about 1:2.7 odds, or about 27% equity needed.\n\nAgainst a typical 3-betting range from a short stack, KJo has maybe 35-40% equity. But if they're very short (effectively all-in), they might be pushing with a wide range.\n\nHowever, I have position advantage postflop if we both have chips left.\n\nWait, if Seat 5 really only has 4 chips, this raise would be an all-in for their last 4 chips. But the raise amount is 87, which suggests they have more chips.\n\nLet me check the action sequence again:\n- Seat 5 post_sb 4\n- Seat 1 post_bb 8  \n- Seat 2 fold\n- Seat 3 (me) raise 20\n- Seat 5 raise 87\n- Seat 1 fold\n\nSo Seat 5 raised from 4 to 87 (adding 83). If they started with 4 chips, they'd be all-in for 4. But the raise is to 87, so they must have at least 87 chips.\n\nActually, looking at the player list: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 4 chips\". This might mean they have 4 chips AFTER posting the SB? Or it's a display error.\n\nRegardless, the decision: I raised to 20, got 3-bet to 87. I need to call 67 more.\n\nGiven opponent's history: They've raised twice in recent hands (hand 45: raise 16, hand 48: raise 71). In hand 48, they raised to 71 preflop. That was a substantial raise.\n\nMy hand is marginal against a 3-bet. KJo doesn't play well against a 3-betting range. I'm out of position if I call? Actually I'm on the button, so I have position.\n\nBut if I call, I'll have 232 - 67 = 165 left, pot will be 115 + 67 + 67 = 249. Effective stack-to-pot ratio would be about 0.66, which is committing.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 31.5 BB, which is a medium stack. Seat 5 appears to be short-stacked (if the 4 chips is accurate, they're desperate).\n\nI think folding is reasonable here. KJo is not strong enough to call a 3-bet, especially when the opponent has shown willingness to raise. Better to preserve my stack"

Seems somewhat aggressive but also folds frequently.\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Mostly folds preflop, occasionally calls. More passive.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: No data yet.\n\n**Position Considerations:**\n- Being UTG with 78o is very weak. This is a clear fold from early position.\n- We have 3 players left to act after us (SB, BB, and GPT-OSS-120B).\n- The blinds are 4/8, so calling 8 chips is 3.1% of our stack.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- We have 31.5 BB, which is a workable stack. No need to take marginal spots.\n- 78o has poor playability postflop, especially from out of position.\n- The hand has some speculative value (can make straights) but not worth playing from UTG.\n\n**Decision:**\nClear fold. 78o is too weak to open from UTG. Better to wait for better spots. The pot odds (8 to win 12) aren't compelling enough given the hand strength and position disadvantage.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"78o is too weak to open from UTG (early position).

With 2h6d, I have a terrible hand that will rarely hit the flop well. Even if I do hit a pair, it's a weak pair that's vulnerable.\n\nGiven that I'm in position (I'll act after the SB post-flop) and the pot is small (16 chips), and I have a trash hand, the best play is to check and see a flop. If the flop is terrible, I can easily fold. If I somehow hit something, I can play cautiously.\n\nRaising would be bad with this hand - I'd be bloating the pot with a weak hand. Folding would be too tight heads-up from the BB when I've already put in 8 chips.\n\nSo I should check.",

This is a very connected board with:\n- Straight possibilities: Q8, 8Q, KQ, QK (open-ended straight draws)\n- Flush draw with diamonds\n- Many possible pairs and two-pair hands\n\n**My hand:**\n2\u2665 6\u2666 gives me absolutely nothing.

In hand #49, they raised preflop and then bet on the flop. In hand #51, they raised preflop. They've shown willingness to bet on flops.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 32 chips, I need to call 16 chips.

Folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm out of position (BB), which makes playing this hand even worse.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is an easy fold.

It's ahead of most of Kimi-K2's raising range. From the opponent data, I see Kimi-K2 has raised to 24 several times before (hands 49 and 51). This seems to be their standard opening raise size.\n\n**Position Considerations:**\nI'm in the SB, so I'll be out of position postflop against the raiser. This is a disadvantage, but with JJ it's worth playing.\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\n- My stack: 240 chips (30 BB) - healthy but not huge\n- Kimi-K2: 267 chips\n- BB (GPT-OSS-120B): 111 chips - short stack that could call or shove\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Too weak with JJ\n2. **Call (20)**: Play pot in position disadvantage\n3. **Raise**: 3-bet to isolate\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWith 30 BB, I need to accumulate chips. JJ is a hand worth playing aggressively. A 3-bet would be good here to isolate the raiser and potentially get heads-up.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should 3-bet. Standard sizing would be to 60-72 total (7.5-9x BB). Since minimum raise is to 40, I'll raise to 60 total (which is 56 more from my current 4).\n\nThis puts pressure on Kimi-K2 and isolates them. If they 4-bet or shove, I'll have a decision, but with JJ and 30 BB, I'm likely committed.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 60,\n  \"reasoning\": \"JJ is a strong hand worth 3-betting from SB against a standard raise.

Short-stacked opponent likely committed with any piece after calling 3-bet preflop.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I have Js Jc (middle set on the flop - very strong!)\n- Board: Jd 7d 9c\n- My stack: 184 chips (23 BB)\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B with only 59 chips total (very short stack)\n- Pot: 144 chips\n- I'm on the button, opponent is in the big blind\n- Preflop action: Seat 2 raised to 24, I 3-bet to 60, GPT-OSS-120B called 52, Seat 2 folded\n- Now on the flop, I have position and it's checked to me\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **My hand**: Top set with JJ on Jd 7d 9c board. This is an extremely strong hand - only straight draws (T8, 86) or flush draws (diamonds) can beat me right now.\n2. **Opponent stack**: Only 59 chips total. They called my 3-bet preflop with a very short stack.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the data, GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop but made two raises recently (hands 48 and 53). They're short-stacked and likely looking for a spot to double up.\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 144, opponent has 59 total. If I bet, they're getting good odds to call with draws.\n5. **Board texture**: Jd 7d 9c - there's a flush draw (diamonds) and straight draws (T8, 86, maybe QT for gutshot). Also possible two-pair combos like J9, J7, 97.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- With top set, I want to build the pot and get value\n- Opponent is short-stacked (59 chips) - they might be committed with any decent hand\n- I should bet to charge draws and get value from weaker hands\n- Since opponent is so short, I could consider betting enough to put them all-in (they have 59 total, pot is 144)\n- Minimum raise is 36, but I could bet more\n\n**Decision:**\nI should bet to build the pot. Given opponent's short stack, I should bet enough to either get them to commit or fold out their equity. A bet of around 40-50 would leave them with only 9-19 chips behind, making them likely to call with any piece.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: opponent has 59 total. If I bet 50, pot becomes 194, and they'd need to call 50 with 59 behind. That's giving them 3.9:1 odds, which might be too good for draws. I should bet more to price out draws.\n\nBetter to bet 59 (their entire stack) or close to it. That would put them all-in. With top set, I want to get all the money in while I'm ahead.\n\nLet me check: Minimum raise is 36. I could raise to 95 (which would be 35 more than minimum). Actually wait, \"raise_to\" is total amount. Currently pot is 144, amount to call is 0. If I want to bet 59 (putting opponent all-in), I'd need to raise to 59? Let me think...\n\nActually, I need to understand the betting structure. \"Amount to call: 0\" means no bet facing me. If I want to bet 59 chips, I would \"raise\" to 59 (total amount). That's a bet of 59 into 144 pot.\n\nYes, I'll raise to put opponent all-in. With top set on a draw-heavy board, I want to get maximum value and protect against draws.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 59,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Top set on draw-heavy board (flush and straight draws).

Hand is very weak - 4h8h has poor equity against likely ranges\n2. Position is good but doesn't justify playing such a weak hand\n3. Pot odds are decent (3.5:1) but hand needs better implied odds\n4. Risk of squeeze from Seat 1 (BB) or all-in from Seat 5 (SB)\n5. Better to preserve chips with such a marginal hand\n\nGiven the weakness of 4h8h, even with position and decent pot odds, this is a clear fold.

I need to output a JSON object with 'action', 'raise_to' (if raising), and 'reasoning'. Let me think about the hand again.\n\nI'm UTG with Ks Ts, 328 chips (41 BB). Blinds 4/8. Action: SB posted 4, BB posted 8. Amount to call is 8. Minimum raise to 16. Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nI previously reasoned that KTs from UTG is marginal and I should fold. That seems reasonable. But let me double-check if there's any reason to play this hand.\n\nTable has 5 players: Seat 1 (SB, 325 chips), Seat 2 (BB, 271 chips), Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 (55 chips short stack). Seat 1 is tight, Seat 2 has shown some aggression, Seat 5 is short and aggressive.\n\nFrom UTG, KTs is definitely a fold in most situations. The only reason to play would be if the table is very passive or if I have a strong read. But Seat 2 has shown aggression, so I could get raised behind me. Also, being out of position with a drawing hand like KTs is tough.\n\nWith 41 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. Better to wait for better positions or stronger hands.\n\nSo I'll fold. Need to output JSON: {\"action\": \"fold\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"KTs from UTG is marginal, especially with aggressive players behind. Better to wait for stronger spots with position.\"}\n\nWait, the reasoning should be brief. Let me make it concise.\n\nActually, let me check if there are any other considerations. The short stack at Seat 5 might shove over a raise, which could be problematic. Also, I have no specific reads that the table is particularly weak.\n\nYes, fold is correct. Let me output the JSON.",

Seat 2 (SB) checked, and now it's my action with amount to call = 0.\n\nI have trips, which is a very strong hand on this flop. The only hands that beat me are:\n- QQ for a full house (but that would be three of a kind with a pair on board, making a full house)\n- QT for a full house (ten with queen kicker, but board has two tens, so QT would be two pair with trips on board, not a full house)\n- Actually, let me think: Board is Ts Td Qs. I have 7c Tc. So I have three tens with 7 kicker. Better hands would be:\n  1. QQ (full house: queens full of tens)\n  2. QT (two pair: queens and tens, but with trips on board, this would be a full house: tens full of queens)\n  3. TT (quad tens - impossible since I have one ten)\n  4. Qx where x makes a straight? No straight possible yet.\n\nActually, QT would be a full house (tens full of queens) since board has two tens and one queen. So QT is a full house.\n\nAlso, any hand with a ten and a better kicker than 7 would beat me (JT, T9, T8, AT, KT). But those are just trips with better kicker, not full houses.\n\nThe board is somewhat wet with a flush draw possible (two spades). Qs is on board, so someone could have AsKs for nut flush draw, or other spade combos.\n\nGiven I have trips, I should build the pot. I'm last to act on the flop (after SB checked). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called preflop and hasn't acted yet on flop - actually wait, let me re-read: Actions show Seat 2 checked, and now it's my action. So Seat 1 is still to act after me? Actually the action order: preflop went Seat 5 fold, Seat 1 call, Seat 2 call, Seat 3 check. On flop: Seat 2 check. So I'm next (Seat 3). Then after me would be Seat 1.\n\nSo I'm in middle position on flop with trips. I should bet for value. Looking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has shown various flop actions - bets, calls, folds, checks. Mixed.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has bet on flop several times, also raised once.\n\nThe pot is 24 chips. I should bet around 12-18 chips (half to 3/4 pot). Minimum raise to is 8, but that's too small. I have 320 chips total.\n\nI should bet to get value from hands like Qx, flush draws, straight draws, and other tens with worse kickers. Also to protect against draws.\n\nLet me check if there are any straight draws: Board is T T Q. Possible straight draws would need J9 or J8 or 89? Actually J9 would be open-ended (J9 needs 8 and K? Wait: T T Q board. For J9: needs 8 and K for straight? Actually J9 would have gutshot to K? Let me think: J9 would need K for straight? Board T T Q, so J9 needs 8 and K? No, T T Q, J9 would have 8-K straight? Actually 8 9 T J Q K - that's 6 cards. J9 needs 8 and K for straight, but board has T and Q, so J9 has gutshot to K (needs K for straight: 9 T J Q K). Yes, J9 has gutshot.\n\nActually better: KJ would have open-ended (needs A or 9). AJ would have gutshot to K.\n\nBut main concern is flush draw with two spades.\n\nI should bet around 16 chips (2/3 pot). That's a reasonable size.\n\nMy decision: raise to 24 (bet 16 into 24 pot). Actually wait: \"raise_to\" is total amount. I currently have 8 in (BB). So to bet 16, I would raise_to 24 (8 + 16).\n\nLet me think about checking instead: Could check-raise? But I'm not last to act - Seat 1 still to act after me. If I check, Seat 1 might bet, then I could check-raise. But Seat 1 might check behind. With trips, I want to build pot."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm in the small blind with Kd 5d. My stack is 340 chips (42.5 BB). Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 24 (3x BB). The pot is 36 chips, and I need to call 20 chips. The minimum raise would be to 40 total.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from Seat 2: I see they raised to 24 in hand #56 as well, then folded on a later street. They've shown pocket 44 in a showdown. They seem to be playing a mix of hands - sometimes calling, sometimes raising.\n\nMy hand: Kd 5d is suited, which gives some potential for flush draws. However, K5 suited is not a strong hand, especially from the small blind facing a raise. The king is good, but the 5 is a weak kicker.\n\nPosition considerations: I'm out of position for the rest of the hand, which is a significant disadvantage. I'll have to act first on every street after the flop.\n\nStack sizes: \n- I have 340 chips (42.5 BB)\n- Seat 2 has 239 chips (29.9 BB) - they have a shorter stack\n- Seat 5 (BB) has only 47 chips (5.9 BB) and will likely fold\n\nPot odds: I need to call 20 to win 56 (current pot of 36 + my call of 20). That's about 35.7% pot odds. K5s vs a typical raising range doesn't have 35% equity, especially out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (42.5 BB) and should avoid marginal situations out of position. Seat 2 has a shorter stack (29.9 BB), so they might be more aggressive.\n\nGiven all this:\n1. Hand strength is weak - K5s is not a hand I want to play for a raise, especially out of position\n2. Position is terrible (SB)\n3. Opponent seems to be raising with a reasonable range\n4. Pot odds aren't great for this hand\n5. Better to preserve my stack for better spots\n\nI should fold. This is a marginal hand that will be difficult to play post-flop out of position. The suitedness isn't enough to justify calling here.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K5s is too weak to call a raise from SB out of position.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I have 9s4d on the button. The action: Seat 5 posted SB 8, Seat 1 posted BB 16, Seat 2 folded. So it's on me with 16 to call.\n\nMy stack is 340 chips (21.2 BB). The BB is 16 chips, so I'm fairly deep. My hand is 9s4d - a very weak hand, unsuited, not connected. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\nHowever, let me consider the opponents:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has only 39 chips (2.4 BB) - extremely short stacked and already posted SB\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 313 chips (19.6 BB) in the BB\n\nFrom the history I saw:\n- GPT-OSS-120B is very short and might be desperate\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking seems to play somewhat tight based on the hands I saw\n\nThe pot is 24 chips (SB 8 + BB 16). If I call 16, the pot becomes 40. Then the short stack (GPT-OSS-120B) only has 31 chips left (39 - 8 SB = 31). They might go all-in with any two cards.\n\nBut my hand is terrible. Even against a short stack's random range, 94o is very weak. I'm on the button, which is good position, but with this hand it doesn't matter much.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 21.2 BB, which is a decent stack. I should preserve it for better spots. Calling with 94o is burning chips.\n\nLet me think about potential steals: If I raise, I could try to steal the blinds, but the BB has 19.6 BB and might defend. With 94o, I don't want to play a raised pot.\n\nActually, wait - the short stack only has 39 total, so 31 left after posting SB. They're almost certainly going all-in with any two if they decide to play. So if I call, I might face an all-in from them, and then the BB might call or raise.\n\nBetter to just fold and wait for a better spot. This hand is trash.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I've been playing somewhat tight, folding a lot. That's fine.\n\nSo my decision: fold.\n\nReasoning: 9s4d is a very weak hand, unsuited and not connected. With a short stack likely to shove any two, and the BB having a decent stack that might defend, this is not a good spot to enter the pot. Better to preserve my 21.2 BB stack for better opportunities.",

It's a suited hand but with low cards - J6 suited is not a strong starting hand from early position. \n\nMy stack: 340 chips (21.2 BB) - this is a medium stack in tournament terms. I need to preserve chips but also look for spots to accumulate.\n\nPosition: UTG (early position) - this is the worst position to play marginal hands from.\n\nOpponents: There are two Kimi-K2 players and a short-stacked GPT-OSS-120B with only 63 chips. The short stack might be looking to get all-in soon.\n\nGiven that I'm in early position with a weak hand, the standard play would be to fold. Playing J6 suited from UTG is generally not recommended as it can get me into trouble against players in later positions who can put pressure on me.\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to deviate from standard play. The short stack might be looking to shove, but I'm not in a position to capitalize on that from UTG. Also, with two other players to act behind me (including the short stack), I could easily face a raise.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 16 to win 24, which is 1.5:1 odds, but the hand itself is too weak to justify playing from this position.\n\nTournament considerations: With 21.2 BB, I'm not in desperate need to gamble with weak hands.

With 20BB stack, I need to be careful about getting involved in marginal spots.\n\nGiven the situation:\n- I have position on both opponents (they act before me postflop)\n- Pot is 48 chips, I've already invested 16 as BB\n- Opponents have shown weakness by just calling (no raises)\n- J9o can make straights, pairs, but is easily dominated\n\nChecking seems reasonable here. Raising would be aggressive but could take down the pot preflop. However, with 20BB, I don't want to commit too many chips with J9o. A raise to say 48-64 chips would be ~15-20% of my stack, which is significant.\n\nGiven opponent tendencies and my stack size, checking to see a flop cheaply is prudent. If I hit something on the flop, I can proceed cautiously. If not, I can fold.\n\nI'll check.",

Actually, let me re-read: I'm Seat 3, I posted SB 8. Seat 1 posted BB 16. Seat 2 folded. So I'm in the small blind? Wait, the description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". But actions show \"Seat 3 post_sb 8\" and \"Seat 1 post_bb 16\". That seems contradictory. Let me think: There are 5 seats, but only 3 active players? Seats 4 and 5 have 0 chips and folded. So we have 3 players: Seat 1 (BB), Seat 2 folded, Seat 3 (me, SB). But it says my position is BB. Actually, maybe the positions are: Seat 1 is SB, Seat 2 is BB, Seat 3 is UTG? But Seat 2 folded. Hmm.\n\nLet me re-examine: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". \"Your Stack: 316 chips\". \"Blinds: 8/16\". \"Pot: 24 chips\". Actions: \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 8\" - that's me posting small blind. \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 16\" - Seat 1 posts big blind. \"preflop: Seat 2 fold\". So actually, I'm in SB, not BB. But the interface says BB. Could be a labeling issue. Anyway, the situation: I posted SB 8, Seat 1 posted BB 16, Seat 2 folded. So action is on me? Actually, after posting, action would normally be on UTG (Seat 2), but they folded. So now action is on me?

Ten-deuce suited. In SB vs BB heads-up, this is a marginal hand. I have 316 chips (19.8 BB). Opponent (Seat 1) has 321 chips. This is a tournament, so stack preservation matters.\n\nI should consider opponent tendencies. Let me recall opponent actions.",

So it's heads-up between me (BB) and Seat 1 (BB). Actually wait: Seat 1 posted BB 16, I posted SB 8. Seat 2 folded. So I need to call 8 more to match the BB. So I'm facing a decision to complete the blind.\n\nMy hand: 2s Ts. This is a weak hand, but it's heads-up from the BB against a single opponent who just posted the BB. The opponent (Seat 1) has been playing somewhat tight recently - looking at the history: in hand 58 they raised preflop to 24, in hand 59 they called 8, in hand 60-62 they folded, in hand 63 they called 16. So they seem to be playing a mix.\n\nGiven this is heads-up and I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (I need to call 8 into a pot of 24), I should defend fairly wide. T2 suited is not great but it has some potential. I'm getting good odds. However, my stack is 316 chips (19.8 BB), which is short but not critical. The opponent has 321 chips.\n\nIn tournament play with 20BB stacks, I should be defending my BB fairly wide against a single limper. But wait, Seat 1 didn't limp - they just posted the BB. Actually the action: I posted SB 8, Seat 1 posted BB 16, Seat 2 folded. So Seat 1 hasn't taken any action yet - they just posted the blind. So I have the option to complete, raise, or fold.\n\nIf I complete, the pot will be 32 (8+16+8), and Seat 1 will have the option to check or raise. If I raise, I'd be raising from the BB against a player who just posted the BB.\n\nGiven T2 suited is weak, but I'm getting good pot odds to call. Raising seems too aggressive with this hand. Folding would be too tight given the pot odds.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been in similar spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this river situation. I'm in the BB with 2s Ts, board is 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh. The river is Jh, completing the board. I have a pair of tens with a 2 kicker, so just a pair of tens. Actually wait, I have 2s Ts, board has 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh. My hand is 2s Ts. So I have a pair of tens with a 2 kicker. No flush possible for me (I have spades, board has clubs). There's a possible flush on board with clubs. The river Jh is a club? Wait board: 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh. The Jh is hearts, not clubs. So there are three clubs on board: 9c, 5c, 3c. So there's a possible flush with clubs.\n\nPot is 32 chips. My stack is 308 chips (19.2 BB). Opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 321 chips. I'm in BB, opponent is in SB? Wait positions: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (SB), Seat 2 is Kimi-K2 (folded), Seat 3 is me (BB). Actually preflop: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 8, Seat 1 post_bb 16. So I was SB? Wait I'm Seat 3, my position is BB. But blinds are 8/16. So SB posts 8, BB posts 16. I'm in BB, so I posted 16? Actually preflop actions: Seat 3 post_sb 8, Seat 1 post_bb 16, Seat 2 fold, Seat 3 call 8, Seat 1 check. That means I (Seat 3) posted SB 8, opponent (Seat 1) posted BB 16, then Seat 2 folded, then I called additional 8 to match BB, then opponent checked. So I started as SB, but effectively we're heads-up with me as SB and opponent as BB. But the hand says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Maybe mislabeled? Anyway.\n\nNow on river, action is on me. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise. I have a weak hand: pair of tens. The board is 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh. There's a straight possibility: 7-8 would make a straight, but board has 9-5-6-3-J. So possible straight: 7-8 makes a straight (5-6-7-8-9). Also 7-8 would be a straight. Also 4-7 would make a straight (3-4-5-6-7). So there are some straight possibilities. Also flush possible with clubs.\n\nMy hand is weak. I should probably check and see what opponent does. But I could consider a bluff raise if I think opponent will fold often. However, I need to understand opponent tendencies. Let me recall opponent actions.",

Opponent has shown tight tendencies, so a bluff might not work well.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the BB with 2s Ts on a board of 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh. The river just completed with Jh. The pot is 32 chips. I have 308 chips (19.2 BB). My opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking has 321 chips. We're heads-up after everyone else folded preflop. I posted SB 8, opponent posted BB 16, I called the additional 8 to complete. Both checked flop and turn. Now on river, amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand: 2s Ts. Board: 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh. I have Ten-high with no pair. The board shows 9,5,6,3,J with three clubs. I don't have a club. Best possible hand is Ten-high. This is a very weak hand - basically air.\n\nOpponent checked twice on flop and turn. They could have a weak hand too. The Jh on river might have hit some Jx hands, but they didn't bet flop or turn with any draws.\n\nLooking at opponent history: They've been fairly tight - folding preflop 4 times in recent hands, calling twice, raising once. On hand 63 (previous hand), they called BB preflop and bet 24 on flop. So they're capable of betting when they have something.\n\nGiven the board texture: 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh - there are straight draws (7-8, 4-7, 2-5), flush draws (clubs), and now J high. My opponent could have missed draws, weak pairs, or nothing.\n\nMy position: I'm out of position (BB vs SB). But since both checked all streets, this is likely going to a showdown if I check.\n\nIf I raise: Minimum raise to 16 (total). That would be a bet of 16 into 32 pot (50% pot). But with Ten-high, I'm bluffing. Would opponent call with worse? Possibly if they have nothing. But they might call with any pair.\n\nPot odds: If I bet 16, pot becomes 48, opponent needs to call 16 getting 3:1 odds. They'd call with any reasonable hand.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 19.2 BB, opponent has similar. Not desperate but not deep.\n\nGiven my weak hand and that opponent checked twice, they likely have a weak hand too. A bluff could work, but it's risky. Checking seems safer since I might win at showdown if opponent also has nothing.\n\nBut wait - I should think about what hands I'm representing. I called preflop from SB vs BB, which could be many hands. Checked flop and turn. Now river Jh. If I bet, I could represent a J, a flush, or a straight. But would I play those hands this way? Possibly check-calling or check-raising.\n\nActually, let me think: The board has 3 clubs. I don't have a club. If opponent has a club draw that missed, they'll fold to any bet. If they have a weak pair like 9x, 5x, 6x, 3x, they might call.\n\nGiven opponent's tight tendencies, they might fold weak hands to a bet. But they also might call with any pair.\n\nI think checking is better. I have showdown value of Ten-high, which might be best if opponent has 8-high or 7-high. A bluff risks 16 chips (0.5 BB) with moderate chance of success.\n\nLet me check my hand history: I won hand 59 with trip Tens. That's different.\n\nI'll check and hope my Ten-high is good. If opponent bets after I check, I'll have to decide based on bet size.\n\nActually, I should note: If I check and opponent bets, I'll likely fold since I have Ten-high. But if they check back, I might win.\n\nGiven pot is small (32 chips = 2 BB), not worth risking chips with a bluff.\n\nDecision: Check.",

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted SB 8, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted BB 16. No other players in the hand (Seats 4 and 5 folded).\n\nI need to decide preflop action. Amount to call is 16, minimum raise to 32.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, SB): Has been folding a lot preflop (hands 60, 61, 62 folded). Called once in hand 63 and checked through. Seems somewhat tight.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, BB): Has shown some aggression (raised to 24 in hand 60 preflop), but also calls and folds. Called a 47 chip bet in hand 62 preflop.\n\nMy hand: Pocket Tens is a strong hand, especially in position on the button. With only the blinds left to act, this is a good spot to raise.\n\nStack sizes: I have 19.2 BB, which is short but not critically short. The blinds have similar stacks (21.5 BB and 19.1 BB).\n\nTournament considerations: Need to accumulate chips. Pocket Tens is a premium hand in this situation.\n\nOptions:\n1. Call (16 chips): Not great - gives the blinds a cheap look at the flop with marginal hands.\n2. Raise: Standard play. I should raise to around 2.5-3x BB, which would be 40-48 chips.\n3. All-in: Too aggressive with pocket Tens when I have 19.2 BB.\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, a raise is correct. I'll raise to 48 chips (3x BB).\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns I should consider from the opponents. The BB (Kimi-K2) raised preflop in hand 60, so might be willing to defend. But pocket Tens should do well against their ranges.\n\nDecision: Raise to 48.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop situation with pocket tens (Th Td) from the button position. I have 308 chips (19.2 BB). The blinds are 8/16. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted the small blind of 8, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted the big blind of 16. I'm first to act preflop with only the blinds posted.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot preflop (folded hands 60, 61, 62), called once in hand 63, and checked from SB in hand 64. They seem somewhat tight.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown some aggression with a preflop raise in hand 60 to 24 (1.5x BB raise). They've called a few times and folded others.\n\nPocket tens is a strong hand, especially from the button. With only the blinds to act after me, I have position advantage. Standard play here would be to raise. The minimum raise is to 32 (double the big blind), but I should consider a larger raise.\n\nMy stack is 19.2 BB, which is getting short. In tournament play with this stack size, pocket tens is a premium hand that I want to get value from. I should raise to build the pot and potentially take it down preflop, or play a heads-up pot in position.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I've been folding a lot recently (hands 60-63 folded, hand 64 lost with weak hand). I need to accumulate chips. Pocket tens gives me a great opportunity.\n\nConsidering stack sizes: If I raise to around 48-64 (3-4x BB), that would be reasonable. But with my stack being 19.2 BB, I might consider a larger raise or even shove. However, shoving 19.2 BB with TT might be too aggressive when I can raise smaller and still have fold equity.\n\nThe blinds have 345 and 306 chips respectively (21.6 BB and 19.1 BB), so similar stacks. If I raise and get called, I'll have position postflop.\n\nI think raising to 48 (3x BB) is good. It builds the pot, gives me fold equity, and allows me to play postflop in position if called. If I get re-raised, I'd likely need to consider going all-in given my stack size.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns I should be aware of. Seat 2 raised preflop in hand 60 to 24 (1.5x BB), which is a small raise. So they might defend with a wide range.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: I'm on the button with pocket tens. This is one of the best situations in poker. I should definitely raise. The question is how much.\n\nWith 19.2 BB, a standard raise of 2.5-3x BB would be 40-48 chips. That leaves me with 260-268 chips behind (16.3-16.8 BB), which is still playable.\n\nI'll raise to 48 (3x BB). This is aggressive enough to get respect but not commit me too much.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 48,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket tens is a premium hand from button position.

          "content": "I need to respond with a JSON object. The user is telling me my format is invalid. I should provide my decision in the required JSON format. But first, I should think about the hand.\n\nI'm in the BB with A9o. My stack is 316 chips (19.8 BB). The opponent in Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 48 from what position? Looking at the players: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, Seat 2 is Kimi-K2 (folded), Seat 3 is me (DeepSeek-V3.2), Seat 4 and 5 are folded. So the action: Seat 2 posted SB 8, I posted BB 16, then Seat 1 raised to 48. Seat 2 folded. So it's heads-up between me and Seat 1.\n\nI need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise. I have A9o, which is a marginal hand. I'm out of position (BB vs raiser). The raise is to 48, which is 3x the BB (16). I need to call 32 more chips. My stack is 316, so calling would put me at 284. Pot is currently: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 48 = 72 chips. If I call, pot becomes 104. I'd be calling 32 to win 72, giving me pot odds of 2.25:1 (32/72). That's about 31% equity needed.\n\nA9o against a typical raising range from early position? Actually, Seat 1 is in what position? The table has 5 seats, but only seats 1-3 have chips. Seat 1 is the first to act preflop? Wait, typical order: SB (seat 2), BB (me, seat 3), then UTG (seat 4?), but seat 4 is folded with 0 chips. Actually, the players list shows seat 4 and 5 have 0 chips and folded. So Seat 1 is actually the button? Let's think: 5 seats, seat numbers: 1,2,3,4,5. Blinds: SB seat 2, BB seat 3. Then action goes to seat 4, then seat 5, then seat 1, then seat 2, then seat 3. But seat 4 and 5 folded (0 chips). So Seat 1 is the cutoff or maybe button? Actually with 5 seats, button would be seat 1? Let's calculate: If blinds are at seats 2 and 3, then button is seat 1. Yes, that makes sense. So Seat 1 is on the button. That's important: he's raising from the button, which is a much wider range.\n\nSo button raise vs BB. I'm in the big blind defending against a button steal. A9o is a decent defending hand. I should consider defending my blind. However, my stack is 19.8 BB, which is short but not desperate. The opponent has 297 chips (18.6 BB). We're both fairly short.\n\nI should recall opponent tendencies. But the system says I have invalid format. I need to make a decision without the tool results. But I can try to use tools while also outputting JSON? No, I need to output JSON. I could make a decision based on general principles.\n\nGiven it's a button raise, his range is wide: maybe 40-50% of hands. A9o has about 55% equity against a 50% range. Actually, A9o vs 50% range (random hands) has ~58% equity. So I have equity advantage. However, I'm out of position, which reduces my postflop edge.\n\nOptions: fold, call, raise. Raising could be good if I think he's stealing light. Minimum raise to 80. That would be a 3-bet to 80 total (64 more). That's a significant portion of my stack. If I raise to 80, I'd have 236 left, pot would be 144. He might 4-bet shove or call. If he calls, pot is 160, and I have 236 behind (about 1.5x pot). That's awkward.\n\nCalling seems reasonable: defend my blind with a decent ace, see a flop, and play postflop. But being out of position with A9o is tough.\n\nGiven stack sizes, maybe a call is best. I can check-raise flop if I hit. Or fold if I miss.\n\nI should consider tournament implications: we're both short-ish. Winning this pot would give me a boost.\n\nLet me check if I have any history. I'll try to use the tool quickly but need to output JSON. I'll make a decision.\n\nI think I'll call"

That's pot odds of 32/(72+32) = 32/104 = ~30.8%. \n\nLooking at opponent's actions: They've folded a lot preflop (10 out of 20 actions), but when they do play, they've raised once (hand 58), called twice (hands 59 and 63), checked twice (hands 57 and 64). Their raising range seems tight. In hand 58 they raised to 24 (1.5x BB) from early position. Here they raised to 48 (3x BB) from UTG.\n\nMy hand A9o is marginal against a UTG raise. Ace-rag offsuit doesn't play well against a likely tight range. I'm out of position for the entire hand. My stack is 19.8 BB, which is short but not desperate yet.\n\nThe pot odds are decent (30.8%), but I need to consider implied odds and reverse implied odds. With A9o, I could hit an ace and be dominated by better aces, or hit a 9 and be weak. Being out of position makes this worse.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 19.8 BB, opponent has 18.6 BB.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to make a decision in this poker hand. I'm on the button with Kc 6s, 284 chips (17.8 BB). Blinds are 8/16. Seat 1 posted SB 8, Seat 2 posted BB 16. I need to call 16 to play. Minimum raise to 32.\n\nFirst, let me think about my hand: K6 offsuit is a weak hand. Not great from any position, but being on the button is the best position. However, with only 17.8 BB, I'm getting short-stacked and need to consider pushing soon.\n\nLet me consider the opponents: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 513 chips, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 162 chips (about 10 BB). Seat 2 is in the big blind and is also short-stacked.\n\nWith K6o on the button, I could consider raising to steal the blinds, but K6o is really weak. However, with my stack size (17.8 BB), I should be looking for shove/fold spots. The standard shove range from button with 17.8 BB would be wider than K6o, but maybe not this wide.\n\nActually, let me think: With 17.8 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. On the button with two players left to act (SB and BB), I could consider shoving. The SB has 513 chips (32 BB), BB has 162 chips (10 BB). The BB is short and might call wider.\n\nBut K6o is really weak. The problem is if I shove and get called by either player, I'm likely dominated. The BB only has 10 BB, so he might call with a wide range.\n\nAlternatively, I could just call and see a flop, but K6o plays poorly postflop, especially with a short stack.\n\nLet me check if I have any information about opponents. I tried to use tools but got invalid format errors. I'll proceed without opponent data.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 16 to win 24, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. That's decent, but with such a weak hand, I'm not sure.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm at 17.8 BB, which is getting critical. I need to accumulate chips soon. But I also don't want to risk my stack on K6o.\n\nStandard play would be to fold K6o from any position, even button, with 17.8 BB. I should wait for a better spot.\n\nBut let me think about shoving: If I shove 284 into a pot of 24, that's a huge overbet. The SB would need to call 268 more to win 308, getting about 1.15:1 odds. The BB would need to call 268 more to win 308 (actually BB has only 162 total, so he'd be all-in for 162). So they need a decent hand to call.\n\nHowever, K6o has only about 40% equity against a random hand. If I get called, I'm likely behind.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. I have 17.8 BB, still enough for a few orbits.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nWe're in the BB with Qc Ah (Ace-Queen offsuit). Our stack is 268 chips (16.8 BB). Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has only 8 chips total according to the table info, but they just raised 154? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe table shows:\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips\n- But they raised 154 chips preflop\n\nThis is a contradiction. Either the stack display is wrong or there's something unusual. Actually, looking more carefully: Seat 2 posted SB 8, then raised 154. If they only have 8 chips total, they can't raise 154. So maybe the stack display is showing 8 chips as their remaining stack after posting SB? But they'd need at least 154+8=162 chips to make that raise.\n\nLet me check the pot size: 170 chips. That includes: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 154 - wait, that's 178, not 170. Actually, the pot is 170. Let me calculate: SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then Seat 2 raised to 154 total. So they put in 154 total, which means they added 146 more (since they already had 8 in as SB). So the pot should be: 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 146 (additional from raise) = 170. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo Seat 2 has at least 154 chips total. The \"8 chips\" display might be wrong or maybe it's showing something else.\n\nNow, Seat 2's actions: From the recall, they've mostly been folding. In hand 69 they raised to 48 preflop (from SB position against BB), then bet 80 on flop, then folded. They showed down with some weak hands: Tc 7d, 4d 4s, 5s Kc. So they play somewhat loose.\n\nWe have AQo, which is a strong hand, especially heads-up. We're in BB facing a raise from SB. The amount to call is 138, pot is 170, so pot odds are 138 to win 170+138=308, which is about 1:2.2, or we need ~31% equity.\n\nAQo vs a typical SB raising range has much better than 31% equity. Even against a tight range like 22+, A2s+, K9s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T9s, A9o+, KTo+, QTo+, JTo (top 25%), AQo has ~63% equity. Against a wider range, it's even better.\n\nOur stack is 268, we need to call 138, which is about half our stack. If we call, pot will be 308, and we'll have 130 left (8 BB). This creates a SPR of ~0.42, which means we're basically committed postflop.\n\nGiven our stack size (16.8 BB), we're in push/fold territory. With AQo, this is definitely a call (or all-in if raise was allowed, but only call/fold are legal).\n\nThe opponent has shown some aggression but also folds to pressure. They have a small stack relative to their raise? Actually, if they raised to 154 and we have 268, they might have us covered or be similar.\n\nTournament considerations: We need to accumulate chips. Folding here leaves us with 252 chips (15.75 BB), still playable but giving up a good hand. Calling gives us a chance to double up.\n\nGiven the pot odds and hand strength, I think we should call. We're getting good odds, and AQo is strong enough to continue.\n\nWait, but we only have \"fold\" and \"call\" as legal actions. No raise option. So we can't shove. We have to either call or fold.\n\nIf we call, we'll have 130 left (8 BB) going to flop with 308 in pot. We'll be pot committed on most flops. That's fine with AQo.\n\nI think call is correct. Let me check if there's any reason to fold... The opponent might have a premium hand, but even against KK+ or AK, AQo has ~25% equity, which is close to our pot odds requirement of 31%. Actually, against KK+ we have ~28%, against AK we have ~26%, against AA we have ~13%. But their range is wider than just premiums.\n\nGiven their history of showing down weak hands and occasional aggression, I think calling is +EV.\n\nLet me also consider: If we fold, we preserve 252 chips. If we call and lose, we're down to 130 ("

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nWe're in the BB with Qc Ah (Ace-Queen offsuit). Our stack is 268 chips (16.8 BB). Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has only 8 chips total according to the table info, but they just raised 154? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe table shows:\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips\n- But they raised 154 chips preflop\n\nThis is a contradiction. Either the stack display is wrong or there's something unusual. Actually, looking more carefully: Seat 2 posted SB 8, then raised 154. If they only have 8 chips total, they can't raise 154. So maybe the stack display is showing 8 chips as their remaining stack after posting SB? But they'd need at least 154+8=162 chips to make that raise.\n\nLet me check the pot size: 170 chips. That includes: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 154 - wait, that's 178, not 170. Actually, the pot is 170. Let me calculate: SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then Seat 2 raised to 154 total. So they put in 154 total, which means they added 146 more (since they already had 8 in as SB). So the pot should be: 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 146 (additional from raise) = 170. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo Seat 2 has at least 154 chips total. The \"8 chips\" display might be wrong or maybe it's showing something else.\n\nNow, Seat 2's actions: From the recall, they've mostly been folding. In hand 69 they raised to 48 preflop (from SB position against BB), then bet 80 on flop, then folded. They showed down with some weak hands: Tc 7d, 4d 4s, 5s Kc. So they play somewhat loose.\n\nWe have AQo, which is a strong hand, especially heads-up. We're in BB facing a raise from SB. The amount to call is 138, pot is 170, so pot odds are 138 to win 170+138=308, which is about 1:2.2, or we need ~31% equity.\n\nAQo vs a typical SB raising range has much better than 31% equity. Even against a tight range like 22+, A2s+, K9s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T9s, A9o+, KTo+, QTo+, JTo (top 25%), AQo has ~63% equity. Against a wider range, it's even better.\n\nOur stack is 268, we need to call 138, which is about half our stack. If we call, pot will be 308, and we'll have 130 left (8 BB). This creates a SPR of ~0.42, which means we're basically committed postflop.\n\nGiven our stack size (16.8 BB), we're in push/fold territory. With AQo, this is definitely a call (or all-in if raise was allowed, but only call/fold are legal).\n\nThe opponent has shown some aggression but also folds to pressure. They have a small stack relative to their raise? Actually, if they raised to 154 and we have 268, they might have us covered or be similar.\n\nTournament considerations: We need to accumulate chips. Folding here leaves us with 252 chips (15.75 BB), still playable but giving up a good hand. Calling gives us a chance to double up.\n\nGiven the pot odds and hand strength, I think we should call. We're getting good odds, and AQo is strong enough to continue.\n\nWait, but we only have \"fold\" and \"call\" as legal actions. No raise option. So we can't shove. We have to either call or fold.\n\nIf we call, we'll have 130 left (8 BB) going to flop with 308 in pot. We'll be pot committed on most flops. That's fine with AQo.\n\nI think call is correct. Let me check if there's any reason to fold... The opponent might have a premium hand, but even against KK+ or AK, AQo has ~25% equity, which is close to our pot odds requirement of 31%. Actually, against KK+ we have ~28%, against AK we have ~26%, against AA we have ~13%. But their range is wider than just premiums.\n\nGiven their history of showing down weak hands and occasional aggression, I think calling is +EV.\n\nLet me also consider: If we fold, we preserve 252 chips. If we call and lose, we're down to 130 (",

          "content": "I need to make a decision for this hand. I'm in the BB with Qc Ah, board is Jd Tc Js. My stack is 130 chips (8.1 BB). Pot is 308 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) is the only other player, with just 8 chips total. They posted SB 8, raised to 154 preflop, and I called 138. Now on the flop, they checked. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or fold. Legal actions are fold or check.\n\nWait, Seat 2 only has 8 chips total? Let me check the player list again: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips. That seems odd since they raised to 154 preflop. Maybe they went all-in? Actually, if they only had 8 chips, they couldn't raise to 154. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips\" - that must be their current stack after the preflop action. They started with more, raised all-in to 154, and now have 8 chips left? No, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nActually, looking at the preflop action: \"Seat 2 post_sb 8\" then \"Seat 2 raise 154\". If they only had 8 chips total, they couldn't raise to 154. Maybe the 8 chips is a mistake or there's something I'm missing. Let me think: Pot is 308 chips. Blinds are 8/16. I posted BB 16. Seat 2 posted SB 8, then raised to 154. That's a raise of 146 more (8+146=154). I called 138 more (16+138=154). So total pot: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 154 + call 138 = 316? Actually: SB 8, BB 16, Seat 2 raises to 154 total (adds 146), I call 138 more. So pot = 8 + 16 + 154 + 138 = 316. But it says pot is 308. Close enough, maybe rounding.\n\nBut Seat 2's stack shows 8 chips. That might be their remaining stack after the raise? If they had 162 chips total (154+8), raised to 154, leaving 8. That makes sense. So Seat 2 has only 8 chips left, effectively all-in on any further betting. They checked because they have no more chips to bet? Actually, they can still bet their remaining 8 chips. But minimum raise would be to 138, which they can't do. They could bet 8 though. But they checked.\n\nI have Qc Ah on Jd Tc Js board. That's Ace-high with a gutshot straight draw (need a King for Broadway). Also backdoor flush potential with Qc Ah (clubs). Actually, I have Qc and Ah, so only one club. No flush draw. But I have overcards (Ace) and gutshot to Broadway (K gives A-K-Q-J-T). Also possible straight with Q-9? No, that's not a straight. I need a King for nut straight.\n\nOpponent has 8 chips left. They raised preflop and then checked flop. They could have a wide range: pairs, broadway cards, maybe suited connectors. With two jacks on board, trips are possible but less likely. They might have missed with AK, AQ, etc. Or they could have a jack.\n\nPot is 308, I have 130 chips total. If I bet, I could try to win the pot now. But opponent only has 8 chips left, so they're essentially all-in for any bet. If I bet, they'll likely call with any piece. But if I check, we see turn and river for free (since they have no chips to bet).\n\nMy hand has decent equity against many hands. Against a jack, I have about 25% equity (gutshot). Against an overpair like QQ-AA, I have less. Against AK, AQ, KQ, etc., I have good equity. Against a ten, I'm behind but have outs.\n\nGiven opponent only has 8 chips left, and pot is 308, I'm getting huge pot odds. I should probably check and see a free turn, then decide. If I hit my King on turn, I can bet (though they only have 8 chips). If I miss, I can check again and see river for free.\n\nActually, wait: if I check, and turn comes, they might bet their last 8 chips if they improve. But they only have 8 chips, so risk is minimal. Checking seems best to realize my equity for free.\n\nBut also consider: I could bet small to try to"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to make a decision for this hand. I'm in the BB with Qc Ah, board is Jd Tc Js. My stack is 130 chips (8.1 BB). Pot is 308 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) is the only other player, with just 8 chips total. They posted SB 8, raised to 154 preflop, and I called 138. Now on the flop, they checked. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or fold. Legal actions are fold or check.\n\nWait, Seat 2 only has 8 chips total? Let me check the player list again: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips. That seems odd since they raised to 154 preflop. Maybe they went all-in? Actually, if they only had 8 chips, they couldn't raise to 154. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips\" - that must be their current stack after the preflop action. They started with more, raised all-in to 154, and now have 8 chips left? No, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nActually, looking at the preflop action: \"Seat 2 post_sb 8\" then \"Seat 2 raise 154\". If they only had 8 chips total, they couldn't raise to 154. Maybe the 8 chips is a mistake or there's something I'm missing. Let me think: Pot is 308 chips. Blinds are 8/16. I posted BB 16. Seat 2 posted SB 8, then raised to 154. That's a raise of 146 more (8+146=154). I called 138 more (16+138=154). So total pot: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 154 + call 138 = 316? Actually: SB 8, BB 16, Seat 2 raises to 154 total (adds 146), I call 138 more. So pot = 8 + 16 + 154 + 138 = 316. But it says pot is 308. Close enough, maybe rounding.\n\nBut Seat 2's stack shows 8 chips. That might be their remaining stack after the raise? If they had 162 chips total (154+8), raised to 154, leaving 8. That makes sense. So Seat 2 has only 8 chips left, effectively all-in on any further betting. They checked because they have no more chips to bet? Actually, they can still bet their remaining 8 chips. But minimum raise would be to 138, which they can't do. They could bet 8 though. But they checked.\n\nI have Qc Ah on Jd Tc Js board. That's Ace-high with a gutshot straight draw (need a King for Broadway). Also backdoor flush potential with Qc Ah (clubs). Actually, I have Qc and Ah, so only one club. No flush draw. But I have overcards (Ace) and gutshot to Broadway (K gives A-K-Q-J-T). Also possible straight with Q-9? No, that's not a straight. I need a King for nut straight.\n\nOpponent has 8 chips left. They raised preflop and then checked flop. They could have a wide range: pairs, broadway cards, maybe suited connectors. With two jacks on board, trips are possible but less likely. They might have missed with AK, AQ, etc. Or they could have a jack.\n\nPot is 308, I have 130 chips total. If I bet, I could try to win the pot now. But opponent only has 8 chips left, so they're essentially all-in for any bet. If I bet, they'll likely call with any piece. But if I check, we see turn and river for free (since they have no chips to bet).\n\nMy hand has decent equity against many hands. Against a jack, I have about 25% equity (gutshot). Against an overpair like QQ-AA, I have less. Against AK, AQ, KQ, etc., I have good equity. Against a ten, I'm behind but have outs.\n\nGiven opponent only has 8 chips left, and pot is 308, I'm getting huge pot odds. I should probably check and see a free turn, then decide. If I hit my King on turn, I can bet (though they only have 8 chips). If I miss, I can check again and see river for free.\n\nActually, wait: if I check, and turn comes, they might bet their last 8 chips if they improve. But they only have 8 chips, so risk is minimal. Checking seems best to realize my equity for free.\n\nBut also consider: I could bet small to try to",

Wait, that seems odd - Seat 2 has 8 chips according to the table, but they raised preflop to 154. Let me check: Seat 2 posted SB of 8, then raised to 154 total? Actually, preflop actions: Seat 2 post_sb 8, Seat 3 (me) post_bb 16, Seat 1 fold, Seat 2 raise 154, Seat 3 call 138. So Seat 2 raised to 154 total, putting in 146 more (8 SB + 146 raise). They had 8 chips to start? That doesn't add up. Maybe they had more and lost some? Or the 8 chips is what they have left after the raise? Let me think: If they started with 8 chips, they couldn't raise to 154. So the 8 chips must be their remaining stack after the raise. That makes sense: they raised all-in or near all-in, leaving 8 chips behind. Actually wait, they raised to 154, I called 138 (since I already had 16 in BB). So pot is 308 (154+154). Now on turn, opponent has 8 chips left. They checked. I have 130 chips total, but 16 already in from BB, so I have 114 left? Actually my stack is 130 chips total. I put in 16 preflop as BB, then called 138 more, so that's 154 total invested. 130-154 = -24? That can't be right. Let me recalculate: My stack is 130 chips. Preflop: I post BB 16, leaving 114. Then I call 138 more? That would put me at -24. That's impossible. Maybe the 130 is my stack after the call? Actually, the display says \"Your Stack: 130 chips (8.1 BB)\". That's my current stack, not starting stack. So I started with more, invested 154, and now have 130 left. That means I started with 284 chips. That makes sense. Opponent started with 162 chips (154 raise + 8 left). They're almost all-in.\n\nNow the turn: board is Jd Tc Js 5h. I have Qc Ah. That's AQ offsuit. Board has JJT5 with two hearts? Actually Jd, Tc, Js, 5h - so one heart (5h). I have no hearts. My hand: Ah is a heart, but board has 5h, so I have Ace-high with queen kicker, no pair. I have a gutshot straight draw: I need a king for Broadway straight (A-K-Q-J-T). That's 4 outs. Also backdoor flush draw? No, I have Ah but only one heart on board. Actually Ah is a heart, board has 5h, so two hearts. That's not a flush draw yet (need 3). So basically I have Ace-high with gutshot to Broadway. Pot is 308, opponent has 8 chips left. They checked. I can check or bet. Minimum raise to is 138, but I can't raise because \"raise\" is not in legal actions - only fold or check. So I can only check or fold. Folding would be absurd with a free card. I should check to see a free river, or maybe bet small to try to get the last 8 chips? But betting would require at least a min-raise of 138, which is huge relative to pot and my stack.

With a jack, they might check to trap. With TT, they have a full house now (TT on JJ board). With AJ, they have trips. With AA, KK, QQ, they have overpair but board has trips.

My legal actions are fold or check. Folding is terrible - I get to see a free river card. I should check. But wait, could there be a reason to fold? No, that's insane. I check. So action is \"check\", raise_to null. Reasoning: I have Ace-high with gutshot straight draw, pot is large, opponent has only 8 chips behind and checked, so I check to see a free river card. Might improve to Broadway straight. Folding would be terrible with a free card.\n\nBut let me double-check: Is there any scenario where folding is correct? Maybe if I think opponent has a full house and I have zero equity? But I have 4 outs to Broadway straight (any king). That's about 8.7% equity (4/46). Actually turn to river, 4 outs out of 46 unknown cards = 8.7%. Pot is 308, and if I check, I see river for free. If I bet, I'd have to put in at least 138 which is huge. But I can't bet anyway - only check or fold. So definitely check.\n\nWait, but could I technically \"fold\" to avoid putting more chips in later? No, there's no more betting unless opponent bets their last 8 chips on river. But I can call 8 chips if they bet river. That's trivial relative to pot. So check.\n\nThus JSON: {\"action\": \"check\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"Check to see free river with Ace-high and gutshot straight draw. Opponent has only 8 chips remaining and checked, so taking free card is optimal. Folding would be terrible with potential equity.\"}\n\nBut let me make sure about the stack sizes. Opponent has 8 chips. If they bet 8 on river, pot becomes 316, I have to call 8 to win 316, that's 40:1 odds. I'd call with any piece. So check now.",

Then flop, turn, and river were all checked.\n- Current situation: River, opponent checked, I can check or fold (no raise option since I need to raise to at least 138, which is more than my stack of 130).\n\nKey points:\n1. Opponent has only 8 chips left (0.5 BB) - they're essentially all-in already\n2. The board: Jd Tc Js 5h 6c - paired jacks, no flush possible\n3. My hand: AQ high with Qc Ah - no pair, just Ace-high with queen kicker\n4. Opponent's preflop raise was huge (154 chips when they only had 8 chips to start with? Wait, let me check the action again)\n\nActually, looking at the preflop action: \"Seat 2 raise 154\" but Seat 2 only had 8 chips? That doesn't make sense unless they had more chips earlier. Let me check the stack sizes: Seat 2 has 8 chips now, but they raised 154 preflop? That would mean they were all-in preflop. Actually, looking at the action: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 154\" and then \"preflop: Seat 3 call 138\". So opponent raised to 154 total, I called 138 more (since I already had 16 as BB). So opponent had at least 154 chips preflop? But now they have 8 chips left... Wait, maybe the 8 chips is what's left after the all-in? Actually, if they had 154 chips and went all-in preflop, they'd have 0 left. But they have 8 chips. Something is inconsistent.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's stack: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips\". So they have 8 chips left. That means they didn't go all-in preflop with 154? Or maybe the raise amount is the total they put in, not additional? Let me think: They posted SB of 8, then raised to 154 total. So they put in 146 more (154 total - 8 SB). They had 8 chips left after that? That would mean they started with 154+8=162 chips. Now they have 8 chips left after putting in 154. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, the pot is 308 chips. Let me calculate: My BB 16 + opponent's 154 = 170. That's not 308. Oh, there were other players who folded? Actually, Seat 1 folded, Seats 4 and 5 have 0 chips (folded). So pot should be 16 (my BB) + 154 (opponent) = 170. But pot is 308. That suggests there were antes or something? Or maybe my math is wrong.\n\nActually, looking at the action: \"preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 8\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 16\". So SB posted 8, BB posted 16. Then opponent raised to 154 total. So opponent put in 146 more (154-8). I called 138 more (154-16). So pot = 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 146 (opponent raise) + 138 (my call) = 308. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo opponent has 8 chips left after putting in 154. They started with 162 chips (154+8).\n\nNow the river: Board is Jd Tc Js 5h 6c. Opponent checked. I have AQ high. What could opponent have?\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 actions were folds). In hand #69, they raised preflop (48), then bet flop (80), then folded. So they can be aggressive but also fold to pressure.\n\nGiven they raised preflop big (154), they likely have a strong hand. But then they checked flop, turn, and river. That suggests they missed or have a medium-strength hand. With paired j"

So opponent put in 146 more (154-8). I called 138 more (154-16). So pot = 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 146 (opponent raise) + 138 (my call) = 308. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo opponent has 8 chips left after putting in 154. They started with 162 chips (154+8).\n\nNow the river: Board is Jd Tc Js 5h 6c. Opponent checked. I have AQ high. What could opponent have?\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 actions were folds). In hand #69, they raised preflop (48), then bet flop (80), then folded. So they can be aggressive but also fold to pressure.\n\nGiven they raised preflop big (154), they likely have a strong hand. But then they checked flop, turn, and river. That suggests they missed or have a medium-strength hand. With paired j",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with JSON. Let me think about the situation:\n\n- Board: Jd Tc Js 5h 6c (paired jacks, no flush possible)\n- My hand: Qc Ah (Ace-high with queen kicker)\n- Opponent checked river\n- I can check or fold\n- Pot is 308 chips\n- Opponent has 8 chips left (essentially irrelevant for betting)\n\nMy hand is weak - just Ace-high. But the board is J-T-J-5-6. What hands could opponent have? They raised preflop big, then checked all streets. Could be AK, AQ (like me), maybe TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA. But if they had JJ (full house), would they check all streets? Possibly slow-playing. TT would be trips. But they checked flop with top pair? Unlikely.\n\nActually, with paired board, many hands missed. My AQ high might be best. Opponent might have missed with KQ, Q9, etc. Or they might have a weak pair like 99, 88.\n\nBut they only have 8 chips left - they can't bet anyway. So checking seems best. I shouldn't fold when it's free to see showdown.\n\nWait, I can only check or fold. Folding would be terrible when it costs nothing to see showdown. I should check.\n\nBut let me think about tournament implications: I have 130 chips (8.1 BB). If I lose this pot, I'll be down to... Actually, I already put in 154 chips? Wait, I put in 16 (BB) + 138 (call) = 154. I have 130 chips left. So if I lose, I'll still have 130 chips? No, the pot is separate. I've already invested 154. My stack is 130. So I'm playing for the 308 pot.\n\nActually, I need to be careful. If I check and lose, I still have 130 chips. If I fold... why would I fold when it's free? That makes no sense.\n\nSo I should check. But wait, could there be a reason to fold? Maybe if I'm certain I'm beat and want to avoid showing my cards? But in tournament, information has some value, but not worth folding when it's free.\n\nActually, I just realized: the opponent has 8 chips left. After this hand, they'll be almost out. I have them covered.\n\nLet me check: I have AQ high. On J-T-J-5-6 board, what beats me? Any pair beats me. So if opponent has any pair, I lose. But they checked all streets. Would they check with a pair? Possibly if it's a weak pair like 55, 66, or maybe they have JJ (full house) and are slow-playing. But more likely they have missed overcards like AK, AQ, KQ.\n\nActually, they raised preflop big. Typical range: 77+, AJ+, KQ maybe. On J-T-J flop, AJ would have top pair, would probably bet. JJ would have full house, might check. TT would have trips, might check. 99-77 would have underpair, might check. AK, AQ, KQ missed, would check.\n\nSo it's close. But since it costs nothing to check, I should check.\n\nActually, wait: I just re-read. The opponent is \"Kimi-K2\" in seat 2. But there's also \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\" in seat 1 who folded. Two Kimi-K2s? That's odd. Maybe it's a bot or something. But anyway.\n\nI should check. Let me respond.",

Seat 2 raised to 48 total, so I need to call 40 more chips. Minimum raise would be to 80 total.\n\nFirst, I should consider my position and hand strength. KTs is a decent hand, but not premium. I'm in the small blind, which is a bad position postflop. My stack is short at 7.6 BB, so I'm in push/fold territory.\n\nI need to understand Seat 2's raising tendencies. But the system is not letting me use tools without proper JSON response. Let me just make a decision based on basic poker principles.\n\nWith 7.6 BB, KTs is definitely in my shoving range from the small blind. However, there's already a raise from Seat 2. Seat 2 raised to 48 (3x BB). I have 122 chips total, so if I call 40, I'll have 82 left (5.1 BB) in a pot of 112. That's committing a lot of my stack.\n\nAlternatively, I could shove all-in for 122 total. That would be a raise to 122, which is legal since minimum raise is 80. \n\nPot odds: I need to call 40 to win 112 (72 pot + 40 my call). That's about 36% equity needed. KTs vs a typical raising range probably has around 35-45% equity depending on how tight Seat 2 is.\n\nGiven my short stack and the fact that I'm in push/fold territory, and KTs plays well multi-way but I'm out of position... Actually, with the big blind still to act behind me (Seat 1), that's a concern. If I call, BB might squeeze.\n\nGiven my stack size, I think the best play is to either shove or fold. Calling leaves me with an awkward stack. KTs is strong enough to shove against a single raiser with my stack size.\n\nLet me check if I can recall any information about Seat 2... Oh wait, I need to respond with JSON. Let me just make a decision. I'll go all-in. KTs has good equity against many hands, and with my stack size, it's time to take a stand.

My stack is only 8 chips (0.5 BB), which is confusing because earlier it says my stack is 8 chips but blinds are 8/16. Actually wait, I posted SB of 8 chips preflop, and then raised to 122? That seems impossible with only 8 chips stack. Let me re-read.\n\nHand says: \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" but then preflop actions show: \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 8\" (that's me), \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 16\", \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 48\", \"preflop: Seat 3 raise 122\", \"preflop: Seat 1 fold\", \"preflop: Seat 2 call 74\".\n\nIf I only have 8 chips, how can I raise to 122? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the stack display is wrong or there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the pot size: 260 chips. Let's calculate: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 48 + my raise 122 + call 74? Actually need to calculate properly.\n\nSeat 1 (BB) posted 16, Seat 2 raised to 48 total (so added 32 more), then I raised to 122 total (so added 114 more from my SB of 8? Actually I posted SB 8, then raised to 122 means I put in 114 more). Then Seat 1 folded BB, Seat 2 called 74 more (to match 122). So pot should be: SB 8 + BB 16 + Seat 2's initial 48 + my raise to 122 (but I only had 8? hmm) + Seat 2's call 74 = 268? Actually let's compute: BB 16 + Seat 2's raise 48 = 64. Then my raise to 122 adds 122-8 (since I already posted 8) = 114. So pot now 64+114=178. Then Seat 2 calls 74 more (122-48=74). Total pot 178+74=252. But displayed pot is 260. Close but off by 8.\n\nAnyway, the key point: I have only 8 chips left? But I already put in 122? That can't be right. Maybe the stack display is my current stack after posting SB and raising? Actually if I had 130 chips total, posted SB 8, then raised to 122 total, that would leave me with 130-122=8 chips. That makes sense! So I started with 130 chips, posted SB 8, then raised to 122 total (putting in 114 more), leaving me with 8 chips behind. Yes, that's it.\n\nSo now on the flop, I have 8 chips left, board is 9h 8d 5c, my hand is Kc Ts. I have a gutshot straight draw: need a J for a straight (T-J? Actually K T on board 9 8 5, I need a J for a straight: J would give me J T 9 8 7? Wait, I have K T, board 9 8 5. A J gives me J T 9 8 K - that's not a straight. Actually I need a Q for a straight: Q J T 9 8? That's not consecutive. Let's check: With K T, board 9 8 5, possible straights: I need J Q for a straight? K Q J T 9? That's king-high straight. Actually yes, if a Q and J come, I have K Q J T 9. But that's two cards. Or if a 7 comes, I have T 9 8 7 5? That's not a straight. Actually T 9 8 7 6 would be straight, but I have K T. So I have a gutshot to a straight if a J comes? Wait: J would give me J T 9 8 5 - that's not a straight. I need a J and a Q for a straight. So I have no straight draw. I have two overcards: K and T vs board 9 8 5. So I have two overcards, but the board is low and connected. My hand is not great.\n\nI'm heads-up against Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) who has 242 chips.

Actually if he bets, I'll have to call any bet since I only have 8 chips. So I should check and hope to see turn and river. Folding would be terrible since I have only 8 chips and pot is 260 - I should at least see if I improve.\n\nBut wait, I can fold now? Yes, legal actions include fold. But folding when there's no bet and I have only 8 chips left would be insane. I should check and hope to hit a K or T. Or maybe even bluff if I think opponent will fold? But with 8 chips, I can't really bluff.\n\nActually, I should check. If opponent bets, I'll call with any two cards getting 260:8 odds, which is 32.5:1. I need only about 3% equity to call. My K high probably has at least 20% equity against a random hand. So check-call is correct.\n\nBut wait, I have position? Actually I'm BB, so I act first on flop. I check, then opponent acts.

The hand says \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" but blinds are 8/16. Actually, looking at preflop actions: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 8, Seat 1 post_bb 16, Seat 2 raise 48, Seat 3 raise 122, Seat 1 fold, Seat 2 call 74. That means I raised to 122 total? But my stack is only 8 chips? Something doesn't add up.\n\nLet me re-read: \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" but I posted SB of 8 chips. If I only have 8 chips total, I would be all-in with my SB. But the preflop action shows I raised to 122. That suggests my stack might be larger than 8 chips, or there's a mistake.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: 334 chips. Let's calculate: Preflop: SB 8 + BB 16 + Seat 2 raise 48 + my raise to 122 + Seat 2 call 74. That's 8+16+48+122+74 = 268. But pot is 334, so there's 66 more somewhere. Maybe there were antes or something.\n\nBut more importantly: I have only 8 chips left? That would mean I'm effectively all-in preflop. But the flop action shows I checked and Seat 2 bet 74. If I only have 8 chips, I can't have any more to bet. The amount to call is 74, but I only have 8 chips total.\n\nWait, maybe \"Your Stack: 8 chips\" is incorrect or it means I have 8 chips remaining after the preflop action? Let me think: If I started with more chips, raised to 122, and now have 8 left, that means I started with 130 chips. That makes sense: 130 total, put in 122 preflop, leaving 8 behind. Yes! That must be it. So I have 8 chips left, and the bet is 74 to call. I can only call my remaining 8 chips.\n\nBut the legal actions are \"fold, call\" - no raise option. So I can either fold or call 74, but since I only have 8 chips, I can only call 8 chips (all-in). Actually, in poker, if a player doesn't have enough to call a full bet, they can go all-in for their remaining chips. So calling would put in my last 8 chips.\n\nLet me check the board: 9h 8d 5c. My hand: Kc Ts. I have King-high with a gutshot straight draw? Actually, T-9-8-7... I need a 7 or J for a straight. I have a gutshot to a J (J gives me J-T-9-8-7? Wait, board is 9-8-5, I have K-T. A J gives me J-T-9-8-5, which is a straight? Actually J-T-9-8-5 is not a straight; need 7 for a straight. Let me think: For a straight, I need Q-J or 7-6. Actually, with T and board 9-8-5, I need a 7 to make T-9-8-7-5 straight, or a J to make J-T-9-8-5? That's not a straight. Actually J-T-9-8-5 is J high, not a straight. So I have no straight draw. I have overcards (K high) and a backdoor flush draw? Kc and board has no clubs yet. Actually 5c is a club, so I have Kc and board has 5c, giving me a backdoor club flush draw. But not much.\n\nMy hand is weak. I'm basically drawing to a King or Ten. But I only have 8 chips left, and the pot is 334 chips. If I call 8 chips (all-in), I'm getting huge pot odds: 334:8 = about 41:1. Even with a weak hand, those odds are hard to pass up. I need only about 2.4% equity to break even. Even King-high probably has at least 10-15% equity against a range.\n\nBut I should consider opponent's range. Seat 2 is Kimi-K2 with 168 chips. They raised preflop to 48, called my 3-bet to 122. What range would call a 3-bet? Probably"

So it's folded to me on the button. I have Js4h. My stack is 260 chips (16.2 BB). Blinds 8/16. Pot is 24 chips (SB 8 + BB 16). Amount to call is 16 to match the BB? Wait, actually the actions show: Seat 1 post_sb 8, Seat 2 post_bb 16. Then it says \"Amount to call: 16\". That means I need to call 16 to see the flop? But I'm on the button, so there's no one else to act? Let's think: Positions: Seat 1 is SB, Seat 2 is BB, I'm BTN. Seat 4 and 5 are folded. So it's folded to me on the button. The blinds are already posted. So I can either fold, call 16 (limping), or raise. Minimum raise to 32 total (so raise by 16 more). \n\nMy hand is J4 offsuit, not great. But I'm on the button with only the blinds left to act. This is a steal opportunity. However, my stack is 16.2 BB, which is short but not desperately short. I need to consider opponent tendencies.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 4h Js - This is a weak offsuit hand. J4o is not a good starting hand, especially from the button. It has very little potential for making strong hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is a good position, but with such a weak hand, position alone doesn't justify playing.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 260 chips (16.2 BB) - This is a short stack. At 16BB, I need to be selective about my hands and look for good spots to accumulate chips.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has raised preflop 12 times in 77 hands, showing some aggression. Recently raised to 40 and 48 chips.\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop 19 times, showing even more aggression. Recently made a huge 154-chip raise in hand 72 (with KK), and has been raising to 40-48 chips frequently.\n\n5. **Current situation**: Both opponents are still to act after me. Seat 1 posted SB (8), Seat 2 posted BB (16). I need to call 16 chips to see a flop.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With only 16.2 BB, I need to preserve my stack and pick better spots. J4o is not a hand worth risking chips with, especially when both opponents behind me have shown aggression and could easily raise.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I'd need to call 16 into a pot of 24, getting 1.5:1 odds. But with such a weak hand and potential for raises behind me, these odds aren't good enough.\n\nGiven all this, folding is the clear choice. I should wait for a better hand to play, especially with my short stack. The risk of getting raised behind me or playing a weak hand out of position post-flop makes this an easy fold.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"J4o is too weak to play with 16.2 BB stack.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with Qd 2d, which is a weak hand. The opponent in Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) just limped in. Looking at their recent actions, they've been folding a lot recently (hands 74-77), but they did raise in hand 71 preflop and made a big raise on the flop in hand 69. They have 449 chips vs my 244 (15.2 BB).\n\nThe pot is 40 chips (SB 8 + BB 16 + limp 16). I have position on them since I'm BB and they're UTG/MP? Actually, Seat 1 is first to act after blinds? Wait, let me check: Seat 2 posted SB, I posted BB, Seat 1 called, Seat 2 folded. So I'm last to act preflop with position on the limper.\n\nI have Q2 suited, which is very weak. In the BB with position against a limper, I could consider raising to try to take it down preflop, but Q2s is really weak even for that. My stack is 244 (15.2 BB) which is short but not desperate. The opponent has been folding a lot recently, so they might be playing tight.\n\nHowever, looking at their showdowns: they had KK in hand 9 (premium), T5o in hand 57 (weak), and A4s in hand 64 (speculative). So they're playing some weak hands too.\n\nGiven my position and the fact that I can check for free, I should probably just check and see a flop. Q2s has some flush potential but is otherwise weak. Raising would be risky with such a weak hand, and if called, I'll be out of position postflop (actually no, I have position since I'm BB and they limped? Wait, after the flop, action starts with the first player after the button. The button is Seat 5? Actually need to think about positions...).\n\nBetter to check and see a cheap flop. If I hit something good, I can continue. If not, I can fold. No need to risk chips with Q2s.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. Tournament stage: we're at 8/16 blinds, I have 15.2 BB, which is short but not critically short. The opponent has more chips.\n\nDecision: Check and see a flop.",

The pot is 40 chips, and it's my action with amount to call = 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 1 has been folding a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop). They raised on the flop in hand 69 with 200 chips, and in hand 73 they called preflop and then checked on the flop. They have shown some aggression but also caution.\n\nMy hand: bottom pair with backdoor draws. This is a marginal hand. I'm out of position (BB vs BTN? Actually seat 1 is UTG? Let me check positions: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat 2 was SB, seat 3 is me BB, seat 4 and 5 folded. So seat 1 is UTG? Actually with 5 players, positions would be: seat 1 UTG, seat 2 SB, seat 3 BB, seat 4 BTN? Wait the order is seat 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But seat 4 and 5 folded. So seat 1 acted first preflop and called. That suggests seat 1 might be in early position.\n\nI have 244 chips (15.2 BB). The opponent has 449 chips (28 BB). The pot is 40 chips.\n\nGiven I have bottom pair with a weak kicker, but some draw potential, and I'm out of position, checking seems reasonable. I could consider a small bet to try to take it down now, but with bottom pair and weak draw, I'd rather check and see what the opponent does. If they bet, I might call with my pair and draw odds.\n\nThe board is 6d 9c 2s - fairly dry with no obvious straight draws. My hand has some showdown value but is vulnerable.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with Qd 2d. Board is 6d 9c 2s. I have bottom pair with a weak kicker (queen), but I do have a backdoor flush draw with the diamond. The pot is 72 chips, opponent bet 32. I have 244 chips total (15.2 BB). Opponent has 417 chips.\n\nFrom the opponent history, I see that Kimi-K2 Thinking has been fairly active preflop with raises and calls, but has folded a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop). On the flop in hand 69, they raised 200 (which was likely a big bet). In hand 73, they called preflop, checked flop, then folded to a bet.\n\nMy hand: bottom pair with weak kicker. The board is dry (6d 9c 2s). I hit a pair of 2s, but there are overcards possible. The bet is 32 into 72, which is about 44% pot. This is a standard continuation bet size.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 32 to win 104 (72 + 32). That's about 31% pot odds. My equity: I have 5 outs to improve (three 2s, two queens, though queens might not be clean). Plus backdoor flush draw gives maybe 2 more outs. Roughly 7 outs = ~28% equity on flop. This is close to the pot odds.\n\nHowever, implied odds are poor because my hand is weak and I'm out of position. If I call and turn improves me, I might not get paid. Also, if opponent has a better hand (overpair, 9x, 6x, etc.), I could be drawing nearly dead.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 15 BB, which is getting short but not desperate. Folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\nOpponent tendencies: They've shown aggression on flop before (hand 69 raised 200). They could be betting with a wide range here after limping preflop.\n\nGiven my weak hand, out of position, and marginal pot odds, I think folding is correct. The backdoor flush draw and bottom pair aren't enough to continue here. Let me check if there are any other factors.",

Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe Seat 2 had chips when they raised? Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\" - maybe they're out of the hand? But the action says they raised. Could be a display issue. Regardless, I'm facing a raise to 234 total, and I need to call 226 more (since I already put in 8).

Seat 1 (SB) posted 8, Seat 2 (BB) posted 16. I need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been mostly folding preflop, but called a few times. Showdown hands include KK, T5, A4. Seems to play somewhat tight.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): More aggressive, has raised preflop multiple times. Showdown hands include Tc7d, 44, 5sKc, KK, TdQc. Has shown willingness to play speculative hands.\n\nI'm on the button, which is the best position. With 8T offsuit, this is a marginal hand. At 14.8 BB, I'm getting short-stacked and should be looking for opportunities to accumulate chips. However, 8T offsuit is quite weak.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 16 to win 24 (8+16). That's 1:1.5 pot odds, or 40% equity needed. 8T offsuit doesn't have 40% equity against random hands.\n\nTournament considerations: With 14.8 BB, I'm getting into push/fold territory. I should be looking for better spots. The button position is tempting, but the hand is too weak.\n\nLooking at legal actions: I can fold, call, or raise. Raising would be to at least 32 total.\n\nGiven the hand strength and stack size, folding seems correct. I should wait for a better spot. Seat 2 in the BB might defend wide, but with 8T offsuit, I'm likely dominated.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been playing too tight.",

I should try to get some information about their play.\n\nActually, I realize I need to respond with JSON. But I should think first. With 14.8 BB, I'm getting short-stacked. I need to find spots to accumulate chips. 8c Td is not a great hand, but position helps. The blinds have already posted, so there's 24 in the pot. Calling 16 gives me pot odds of 24:16 or 1.5:1, which means I need about 40% equity.\n\nActually, I should check if raising is better. A small raise might get the blinds to fold. But with such a weak hand, if I get called or raised, I'm in trouble.\n\nGiven my short stack (14.8 BB), I should be looking for better spots. 8c Td offsuit is not a hand I want to play for 7% of my stack.

Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted SB 16, I posted BB 32, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called 32, then Seat 2 raised to 250 total (which means they raised 234 more from their SB position). Seat 2 only has 16 chips total? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check: Seat 2 has 16 chips, but they raised to 250? That would be impossible if they only have 16 chips. Actually, looking at the action: Seat 2 post_sb 16, then Seat 2 raise 250. But they only have 16 chips total? That seems contradictory. Maybe the stack sizes are before posting blinds? Or perhaps Seat 2 is all-in with their 16 chips? But the raise amount is 250, which is more than their stack.

Perhaps the system shows the total bet amount, not the additional? If they have 16 chips and posted SB 16, they can't raise more. Unless they're allowed to raise all-in for less than min raise? But the minimum raise to is 468, which is huge.\n\nWait, let me calculate: Pot is 314 chips. Amount to call is 218. Minimum raise to is 468. My stack is 204, so I can't even call the 218 - I only have 204 total! Actually, I have 204 chips total, and I already posted BB of 32, so I have 172 left. To call 218 more, I'd need to put in 218, but I only have 172 left. So I'm effectively all-in if I call. The amount to call is 218, but my remaining stack is 172. So I can call all-in for 172.\n\nLet me verify: My stack: 204 chips. I posted BB 32, so remaining stack: 172. Amount to call: 218. So I can call all-in for 172. That would put me all-in.\n\nSeat 2 has 16 chips. They posted SB 16, so they're all-in. Seat 1 has 433 chips and called 32 initially. Now facing Seat 2's raise... but Seat 2 only has 16 chips, so their raise can only be for their remaining 0? Something is off.\n\nMaybe the stack sizes are after posting blinds? Let me think: Seat 2 started with 16 chips, posted SB 16, now has 0. Their \"raise 250\" might be a misprint, or maybe it's the total pot? Actually, looking at the action: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 250\". That could mean they raised to 250 total. But they only have 16 chips. Unless the stack size shown is before posting? If Seat 2 had 266 chips, posted SB 16, now has 250, and raised to 250 total (i.e., put in 234 more). That would make sense: they have 250 after posting SB? But the listing says 16 chips. Hmm.\n\nLet me check my memory tools to understand opponent tendencies and past hands. I'll search for similar situations.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this hand. I'm in the BB with Ac Ks, stack is 204 chips (6.4 BB). Blinds 16/32. Pot is 314 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted SB 16, I posted BB 32, Seat 1 called 32, then Seat 2 raised to 250 total. Amount to call is 218, but my entire stack is only 204 chips. So I can only call 204 (all-in). Minimum raise to is 468, but I can't afford that.\n\nWait, let me check: Seat 2's raise: they posted SB 16, then raised to 250 total. That means they put in 234 more (250 total - 16 already). The amount to call for me is 218 (250 - my BB 32). But my stack is 204, so I can only call 204, which puts me all-in.\n\nI have Ac Ks, a premium hand. Seat 2 has only 16 chips? Actually they posted SB 16, then raised to 250. But their stack is listed as 16 chips. That seems contradictory. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\". But they posted SB 16, then raised to 250. That would require 234 more chips, but they only have 16 total? Something's off. Maybe the stack listing is at start of hand? Or maybe Seat 2 has 16 chips after posting SB? Actually if they had 16 chips, posted SB 16, they'd be all-in for the SB. But they raised to 250, which is impossible if they only have 16 chips.\n\nPerhaps the stack listing is current stack after actions? Let me think: Seat 2 started with some amount, posted SB 16, then raised. The raise to 250 might be all-in if they had less than 250. But the listing shows 16 chips. That might be their remaining stack after the raise? If they raised to 250 all-in, and had 266 total? Not sure.\n\nAnyway, I have AK suited (Ac Ks). This is a very strong hand, especially with my short stack of 6.4 BB. I'm facing a raise from Seat 2 who is in the SB. Seat 1 called initially but then Seat 2 raised. Seat 1 might call or fold.\n\nWith AK and only 6.4 BB, I should almost always go all-in. Even if Seat 2 has a premium pair, AK has good equity. And I'm getting pot odds: pot is 314 currently, I need to call 204 all-in. That's pot odds of 314:204, or about 1.54:1. I need about 39% equity to call. AK vs any pair except AA or KK has at least 45% equity. AK vs AA has 7%, vs KK has 30%. But vs random range, AK is strong.\n\nGiven my short stack, I should definitely go all-in. But wait, I can only call, not raise, because \"raise\" is not in legal actions. Legal actions are fold, call. So I can only call all-in (204 chips) or fold.\n\nI should call. Let me check opponent tendencies first though. Use search_observations for Seat 2.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with the JSON format. But first, I should think about the hand. I have Ac Ks in the BB with 204 chips (6.4 BB). Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has only 16 chips and just raised 250? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check: Seat 2 has 16 chips total, posted SB of 16, so they're all-in. They raised 250 but only have 16? Actually, looking at the actions: Seat 2 post_sb 16, then Seat 3 (me) post_bb 32, Seat 1 call 32, then Seat 2 raise 250. But Seat 2 only has 16 chips total. This seems like a misrepresentation. Maybe Seat 2 has more chips? The table says Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips. So they have 16 chips total. They posted SB 16, so they're all-in. The raise to 250 is impossible. Perhaps it's a bug or the raise is actually all-in? The amount to call is 218, which is huge relative to my stack of 204. Actually, I have 204 chips total. I've already posted BB of 32, so I have 172 left. Amount to call is 218, but I only have 172 left? That doesn't add up. Let me calculate: My stack: 204 chips. I posted BB 32, so I have 172 left. Amount to call: 218. That means I need to put in 218 more, but I only have 172. So I would be all-in if I call. The minimum raise to 468 is impossible for me. So my options are fold or call all-in.\n\nBut wait, Seat 2 only has 16 chips. How can the amount to call be 218? Let me reconstruct: Pot is 314 chips. Blinds 16/32. Seat 2 (SB) posts 16. I (BB) post 32. Seat 1 calls 32. Then Seat 2 raises. But Seat 2 only has 16 total, so they can only raise to 16 total? Actually, they already put in 16 as SB, so they have 0 left. They can't raise. Something is off.\n\nMaybe the chip counts are wrong. Let me check the players: Seat 1 has 433, Seat 2 has 16, Seat 3 (me) 204, Seat 4 and 5 have 0 and folded. So Seat 2 indeed has only 16. Their raise of 250 must be a mistake. Perhaps the raise is actually all-in for their remaining stack? But they have no remaining stack after posting SB. Unless the chip count is after posting? They had 16, posted SB 16, now have 0. So they can't raise.\n\nI think there's a data error. But I need to make a decision. I have AKo, a premium hand. I'm facing a raise from a very short stack (16 chips). Actually, if Seat 2 has 16 total, and they raised, the maximum they can put in is 16. So the amount to call should be small. But the UI says amount to call: 218. That suggests Seat 2 actually has more chips. Maybe the chip count displayed is wrong. Let me use tools to recall opponent actions.",

They raised to 250, but they only have 16 chips, so this is essentially an all-in for their remaining stack.\n\nSeat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called 32 preflop. The pot is 314 chips. I need to call 218 chips to match Seat 2's all-in.\n\nMy stack is 204 chips, so if I call, I'd be all-in for my entire stack.\n\nLooking at Seat 2's past raises: they've raised with various hands including KK, K5, Q10, 44, etc. Their most recent raise (hand 79) was 234 chips. They seem to be an active raiser.\n\nI have AcKs, which is a premium hand. Against a short stack all-in of 16 chips, this is an easy call. But wait, I need to call 218 chips, not 16. Actually, Seat 2 only has 16 chips total, so their raise to 250 is essentially an all-in for their remaining 16 chips. The pot is 314, and I need to call 218. But most of that 218 goes into a side pot with Seat 1, since Seat 2 only has 16 chips.\n\nActually, let me think: Seat 2 posted SB 16, I posted BB 32, Seat 1 called 32. Then Seat 2 raised to 250, but they only have 16 chips total. So their effective raise is just their remaining 16 chips. The main pot would be: SB 16 + BB 32 + call 32 + all-in 16 = 96 chips. Then there would be a side pot between me and Seat 1.\n\nBut wait, I have 204 chips total. If I call, I'd be putting in 218 total (my 32 BB plus 186 more). Seat 1 has 433 chips and already called 32.\n\nThis is a difficult spot. I have AK suited, a premium hand. But I'm effectively committing my entire stack of 6.4 BB. Seat 2 is all-in for just 16 chips, so their hand could be anything. Seat 1 called preflop and hasn't acted yet on the raise.\n\nI should consider Seat 1's tendencies too. Let me check.",

I'm in the BB with 8c 9h, facing a BB post of 32 chips, but I already posted SB 16, so I need to call 16 more to complete the BB. I have 188 chips total (5.9 BB). The opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 401 chips. Only one opponent left since others folded. I'm in BB, opponent is in SB? Wait, seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat 3 is me. Seat 1 posted BB 32, I posted SB 16. Actually, I'm seat 3, I posted SB 16. Seat 1 posted BB 32. Seat 2 folded. So I'm in SB, not BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\" but actions show \"Seat 3 post_sb 16\". That seems contradictory. Maybe I'm BB but posted SB? Let me check: blinds are 16/32. SB is 16, BB is 32. I'm seat 3, posted SB 16. So I'm SB, not BB. But it says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Might be a mistake. Anyway, I need to call 16 more to complete the BB? Actually, I already posted SB 16, and now it's my action to call 16 more to match the BB? Wait, the BB is 32 posted by seat 1. I'm SB, I posted 16, so I need to put in 16 more to match BB if I want to play. Amount to call: 16. Yes.\n\nMy hand is 8c 9h, offsuit, not great. I have 188 chips (5.9 BB). Opponent has 401 chips. I'm in SB with a marginal hand. In tournament poker with short stack, I should consider pushing or folding. 8-9 offsuit is not great but can play in some spots. With only 5.9 BB, I might consider shoving if I think opponent will fold often. But opponent is in BB with 401 chips (12.5 BB). They might call with a wide range because they have me covered. However, I need to consider tournament survival. Folding leaves me with 172 chips (5.4 BB). Calling 16 more leaves me with 172 as well? Actually, if I call, I put in 16 more, total 32 in pot, stack becomes 156 (4.9 BB). Then play postflop out of position with a weak hand. Not ideal.\n\nMaybe I should shove? Legal actions: fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to: 64. That's double the BB? Actually, amount to call is 16, minimum raise is to 64 total? That means raise additional 48? Wait, I need to calculate: current bet is 32 (BB). I have put in 16. To raise, I need to raise to at least 64 total. That would be putting 48 more (64 total - 16 already). That's a raise of 32 over the BB? Actually, standard raise is at least double the previous bet. Previous bet is 32 (BB), so minimum raise is to 64. Yes.\n\nIf I shove, that's raise to 188 total. That's a significant overbet. Might get folds from weak hands. But with 8-9 offsuit, I'm not thrilled. However, with 5.9 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Typically, with less than 10 BB, you should either shove or fold preflop. My hand is not strong enough to open-shove from SB? Actually, I'm not opening; I'm facing the BB's bet. Wait, no: the BB posted blind, not a bet. It's my action to complete, raise, or fold. So I can complete (call 16), raise, or fold.\n\nGiven my short stack, completing with 8-9o out of position is bad. I should either shove or fold. Let me think about opponent tendencies. I don't have info yet. But I can assume they're a reasonable player. They might call a shove with a decent range because they have me covered and I'm short. But with 5.9 BB, they might call wider. However, they might fold hands like weak aces, small pairs, etc. 8-9o has some equity against calling range.\n\nPot odds: If I shove 188 total, pot would be 48 (current) + 172 (my additional) = 220? Wait, I already have 16 in. If I shove, I put 172 more (188 total). Opp"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with 8c9h, a mediocre hand. My stack is 188 chips (5.9 BB). The blinds are 16/32. I've already posted the SB of 16, and the BB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted 32. Seat 2 folded, so it's heads-up between me and Kimi-K2 Thinking. I need to call 16 to complete the blind.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding a lot preflop (6 out of 8 hands they could have acted), called twice (once with 16, once with 32). They seem somewhat tight. In hand 78, they called 16 preflop and then bet 32 on the flop. In hand 81, they called 32 preflop and then folded to a raise.\n\nMy hand: 8c9h is not great, but it's suited connectors (well, 8-9 offsuit actually - I misread, it's 8c9h so offsuit). Still, it can make straights and pairs. In a heads-up situation from the BB, I'm getting good pot odds: pot is 48, I need to call 16, so 3:1 pot odds. That's a good price.\n\nMy stack is short (5.9 BB). This could be a spot to push all-in if I think I have fold equity. But looking at opponent tendencies, they've been folding a lot preflop. However, they're in the BB and already have 32 invested. If I raise, minimum raise is to 64 total (32 more). But my stack is only 188, so I could go all-in.\n\nConsiderations: With 5.9 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. 89o is not a premium hand, but it's not terrible for a short stack shove. The opponent has shown some willingness to call (twice), but also folds a lot. If I shove, they need to call 156 more (their 32 already in, my 188 total - they'd need to put in 156 more). That's a significant commitment.\n\nPot if I shove: current pot 48 + my 188 = 236 total. They'd need to call 156 to win 236, getting about 1.5:1 odds. They'd need around 40% equity to call. Most hands have better than 40% equity against 89o, so they might call with a wide range.\n\nBut maybe they'll fold many hands. Given they've folded 6/8 times preflop, they might fold again.\n\nAlternatively, I could just complete and see a flop. With 3:1 pot odds, calling 16 is fine. But then I'll be out of position with a mediocre hand.\n\nGiven my short stack, I think shoving has merit. Let me check my own hand history to see how I've been playing.",

The opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 401 chips. Only one opponent left since others folded. I'm in BB, opponent is in SB? Wait, seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat 3 is me. Seat 1 posted BB 32, I posted SB 16. Actually, I'm seat 3, I posted SB 16. Seat 1 posted BB 32. Seat 2 folded. So I'm in SB, not BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\" but actions show \"Seat 3 post_sb 16\". That seems contradictory. Maybe I'm BB but posted SB? Let me check: blinds are 16/32. SB is 16, BB is 32. I'm seat 3, posted SB 16. So I'm SB, not BB. But it says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Might be a mistake. Anyway, I need to call 16 more to complete the BB? Actually, I already posted SB 16, and now it's my action to call 16 more to match the BB? Wait, the BB is 32 posted by seat 1. I'm SB, I posted 16, so I need to put in 16 more to match BB if I want to play. Amount to call: 16. Yes.\n\nMy hand is 8c 9h, offsuit, not great. I have 188 chips (5.9 BB). Opponent has 401 chips. I'm in SB with a marginal hand. In tournament poker with short stack, I should consider pushing or folding. 8-9 offsuit is not great but can play in some spots. With only 5.9 BB, I might consider shoving if I think opponent will fold often. But opponent is in BB with 401 chips (12.5 BB). They might call with a wide range because they have me covered. However, I need to consider tournament survival. Folding leaves me with 172 chips (5.4 BB). Calling 16 more leaves me with 172 as well? Actually, if I call, I put in 16 more, total 32 in pot, stack becomes 156 (4.9 BB). Then play postflop out of position with a weak hand. Not ideal.\n\nMaybe I should shove? Legal actions: fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to: 64. That's double the BB? Actually, amount to call is 16, minimum raise is to 64 total? That means raise additional 48? Wait, I need to calculate: current bet is 32 (BB). I have put in 16. To raise, I need to raise to at least 64 total. That would be putting 48 more (64 total - 16 already). That's a raise of 32 over the BB? Actually, standard raise is at least double the previous bet. Previous bet is 32 (BB), so minimum raise is to 64. Yes.\n\nIf I shove, that's raise to 188 total. That's a significant overbet. Might get folds from weak hands. But with 8-9 offsuit, I'm not thrilled. However, with 5.9 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Typically, with less than 10 BB, you should either shove or fold preflop. My hand is not strong enough to open-shove from SB? Actually, I'm not opening; I'm facing the BB's bet. Wait, no: the BB posted blind, not a bet. It's my action to complete, raise, or fold. So I can complete (call 16), raise, or fold.\n\nGiven my short stack, completing with 8-9o out of position is bad. I should either shove or fold. Let me think about opponent tendencies. I don't have info yet. But I can assume they're a reasonable player. They might call a shove with a decent range because they have me covered and I'm short. But with 5.9 BB, they might call wider. However, they might fold hands like weak aces, small pairs, etc. 8-9o has some equity against calling range.\n\nPot odds: If I shove 188 total, pot would be 48 (current) + 172 (my additional) = 220? Wait, I already have 16 in. If I shove, I put 172 more (188 total). Opp",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to output a JSON decision. Let me think: I'm in SB with 8c9h, 5.9 BB stack. Facing BB blind. Options: fold, call 16, or raise. With this stack size and marginal hand, best is likely fold. Calling is bad because I'll be out of position with weak hand and short stack. Raising small is pointless; if I raise, I should shove. But is 8-9o good enough to shove? In tournament short stack, shoving range from SB vs BB might include hands like any two cards above certain threshold. 8-9o is not great but has some playability. However, with only 5.9 BB, I might want to wait for a better spot. But blinds are 16/32, so next hand I'll be BB and have to post 32, leaving me with 156 if I fold now (172 - 32 = 140? Wait, I have 188 now. If I fold, I have 172 left (since I already posted 16). Next hand I'm BB, post 32, leaving 140 (4.4 BB). That's even worse. So I'm in a tough spot. Maybe I should shove now with any two cards? Let's consider ICM implications. It's a tournament, but early? Not sure. I think shoving might be better than folding because folding leaves me with 4.4 BB next hand. Shoving now with 8-9o might have decent equity. I need to estimate opponent's calling range. If they call with top 30% of hands, my equity is maybe 35%. Pot odds: if I shove 172 more, total pot if they call: 48 current + 172 my shove + 156 their call? Wait, they have to call 156 more (188 total - 32 they already posted). Actually, they posted BB 32. If I shove to 188, they need to call 156 more. Pot would be 48 + 172 + 156 = 376. I'm investing 172 to win 376, need 31.4% equity. If they call with top 30%, my equity is about 36% against that range (rough estimate). So it's slightly +EV. But if they call wider, my equity goes up. If they call tighter, my equity goes down but they fold more often. Actually, if they fold often, that's good. So shoving might be profitable.\n\nBut I need to be cautious. Let's see if I have any info on opponent. I can't use tools because I need to output JSON. The user said \"Invalid response format\" when I tried to call tools. So I must decide without tool use. I'll assume opponent is typical. With 5.9 BB, standard push/fold charts say from SB vs BB, with 6 BB, you can shove with a wide range including 89o. Yes, I think shove is correct.\n\nI'll shove all-in. Raise_to should be 188 (my total stack). Let's output JSON.",

I need to make a decision based on the information I have.\n\nLet me analyze: I'm on the button with K9o, 7.4 BB stack. Everyone has folded to me. SB and BB are also relatively short (12 BB and 9.3 BB). \n\nWith K9o, this is a marginal situation. In tournament poker with short stacks, we often use push-fold charts. From BTN position with 7.4 BB, K9o is typically in the shoving range against two short-stacked players in SB and BB. \n\nThe pot is 48 chips, I need to call 32. If I shove for 236 total, that's a significant overbet (7.4x the BB), but it might get folds from the blinds who are also short and don't want to risk their tournament life with marginal hands.\n\nHowever, K9o is not a premium hand. It's dominated by many hands that might call (any Ace, any King with better kicker, pairs). \n\nActually, let me think about tournament strategy. With 7.4 BB, I'm in push-or-fold territory. On the button, I should be shoving a wide range to steal the blinds. K9o is probably near the bottom of that range, but might still be profitable.\n\nBut wait, I should consider that the blinds are also short. They might be more likely to call with wider ranges since they're also at risk. \n\nActually, I think folding might be better here. K9o is weak, and with 7.4 BB, I still have some room to wait for a better spot. I'm not in immediate danger of blinding out.\n\nI think I should fold and wait for a better hand.",

That seems contradictory. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\" but then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 378\". Maybe Seat 2 went all-in with 0 chips? Or maybe it's a display issue. Actually, looking at the pot size: pot is 426 chips. Let's calculate: SB 16 + BB 32 = 48. If Seat 2 raised to 378, that's a raise of 346 over the BB? Wait, BB is 32, so raise to 378 means they put in 378 total? Actually \"raise 378\" likely means they raised the amount to 378 total. But they have 0 chips? This is confusing.\n\nLet me check the stack sizes: Seat 1 has 401 chips. Seat 2 has 0 chips (out). I have 140 chips. So Seat 2 is already out? Maybe they folded earlier? But the action says they raised. Possibly a bug in display. However, the amount to call is 362. My stack is 140 chips. I can't call 362 with only 140 chips. Actually, I can only call up to my stack of 140. The amount to call is 362, but I have 140. So I can go all-in for 140. But the legal actions are only \"fold, call\". No raise option. So I can call all-in for my remaining 140.\n\nWait, let's think: I posted SB 16, so I have 124 left? Actually my stack is 140 chips total. I posted SB 16, so I have 124 behind. But the amount to call is 362, which is more than my stack. So I can call all-in for my remaining 124? Actually I already put 16 in, so to call the raise, I need to match the total bet of 378. I have 124 left, so I can call all-in for 124, making my total contribution 140. But the raise was to 378, so if I call all-in for 124, I'm not matching the full bet. However, in poker, if a player goes all-in for less than the full bet, it's a side pot situation.\n\nBut let's recalculate: Pot is 426 chips. How did it get to 426? SB 16 + BB 32 = 48. Then Seat 2 raised to 378. That adds 378 - 32 = 346 more? Actually BB put in 32, so raise to 378 means Seat 2 puts 378 total, which is 346 more than BB. So pot = 16 (SB) + 32 (BB) + 378 (Seat 2) = 426. Yes.\n\nNow I need to call 362 to match the 378 total? Actually I already put 16, so I need to add 362 to make my total 378. But I only have 124 left. So I can call all-in for 124, making my total 140. That creates a main pot of: my 140 + BB 32? Wait, BB already put 32, but they haven't acted yet? Actually Seat 1 (BB) still needs to act. They have 401 chips.\n\nSo the situation: Seat 2 raised to 378. I have 140 total stack. I can call all-in for my remaining 124. Then Seat 1 (BB) can act.\n\nMy hand: As Qc.

Their stack is 16 chips total? That seems odd. Let me check: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips. They posted SB 16, then raised 222. But they only have 16 chips total? That can't be right. Maybe they have 16 BB? No, the blinds are 16/32, so 16 chips is 0.5 BB. Actually, looking at the stack sizes: Seat 2 has 16 chips, that's half a BB. They posted SB 16, which is their entire stack. Then they raised 222? That doesn't make sense - they can't raise more than their stack. Let me re-read: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 222\". But their stack is 16. Maybe it's a misprint? Or maybe they went all-in with their remaining 0? Actually, if they posted SB 16 and have 16 total, they have 0 left. But they raised 222? That's impossible.\n\nWait, maybe the stack sizes are in BB? Let's check: \"Your Stack: 280 chips (8.8 BB)\". So chips are actual chips, not BB. Blinds are 16/32 chips. So Seat 2 has 16 chips total. They posted SB 16, using all their chips. Then they raised 222? That can't be. Unless the raise amount is total put in? Let's think: SB posts 16. Then they raise to 222 total? That would mean they put in 206 more, but they only have 0 left. Hmm.\n\nMaybe the \"raise 222\" is the total amount they have put in? Like they went all-in for their remaining stack? But they only had 16 total, so after posting SB 16, they have 0 left. So any raise would be 0 additional. But it says \"raise 222\". That seems like a mistake.\n\nLet me look at the pot size: Pot: 254 chips. How is that calculated? SB posted 16, BB posted 32, and Seat 2 raised 222? That would be 16+32+222 = 270, not 254. Actually, maybe the raise amount is the additional amount on top of the BB? Let's calculate: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. Then SB raises to 222 total? That would mean SB puts in 222 total, which is 206 more than the 16 they already posted. But they only have 16 total stack, so they can't put 206 more.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me check the amount to call: 190. If SB raised to 222 total, then as BB I have already put in 32, so I need to call 190 more to make my total 222. That matches: 222 - 32 = 190. So SB's total bet is 222. Their stack is 16 chips, but they raised to 222? That means they're all-in for their entire stack of 16? Wait, but 222 is much larger than 16. Unless the stack size listed is wrong.\n\nMaybe Seat 2 actually has 222 chips? Let's look: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\". That's clear. But maybe it's 16 BB? No, it says chips. And my stack is 280 chips (8.8 BB), so 280/8.8 = ~31.8 chips per BB. Actually, blinds are 16/32, so BB is 32 chips. 280/32 = 8.75 BB, which matches 8.8 BB. So chips are actual chips.\n\nSeat 2 has 16 chips, which is 0.5 BB. They posted SB of 16, which is all their chips. Then they raised to 222 total? That's impossible. Unless the raise is from someone else? Let's check actions: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 222\". That's definitely Seat 2.\n\nI think there might be an error in the data. But I need to make a decision anyway. I have Q8 suited in hearts. Facing a raise to 222 total, with 190 to call. My stack is 280. If I call, I'll have 90 left (280 - 190 = 90). Pot would be 254 + 190 = 444? Actually, let's calculate pot: Currently pot is 254. If I call 190, that adds 190, making pot 444. Then we'd go to flop with effective stack of 90 behind (if"

If I call, I'll have 90 left. The opponent has 16 chips total? That seems wrong. But based on the info: SB has 16 chips, posted SB 16, then raised to 222 total. That means they're all-in with their 16 chips? But the raise amount doesn't match. Actually, if they have 16 chips and posted SB 16, they have 0 left. Any raise would be 0 additional. But the system says \"raise 222\". Maybe it's a bug or the stack size is misreported.\n\nLet me think strategically: Q8 suited is not a great hand. I'm getting pot odds: need to call 190 to win 254+190=444? Actually, pot is 254, opponent put in 222 total? I need to call 190 more. So pot would be 254+190=444 if I call. My call is 190, so pot odds are 190:254 \u2248 1:1.34, or about 43% equity needed. Q8 suited vs a random hand has about 40% equity. Against a raising range from SB (even short-stacked), it's worse. But if opponent is literally all-in with 16 chips, then the raise is tiny. But the numbers don't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\". Then \"preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 16\". So they used all 16 chips for SB. Then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 222\". That can't be right. Unless \"raise 222\" means they raised the pot by 222? Or it's a total amount? Actually, in poker notation, \"raise 222\" usually means they raised to 222 total. But with 16 chip stack, impossible.\n\nMaybe the stack is wrong. Let me check other seats: Seat 1 has 385, folded. Seat 3 (me) 280. Seat 4,5 have 0 and folded. So only SB and me. SB has 16 chips. They posted SB 16. So they're all-in with their SB. The raise must be their all-in for remaining 0. But it says \"raise 222\". Could be a display error.\n\nGiven the confusion, I should make a decision based on reasonable assumptions. Q8 suited is marginal. Facing a raise, even from a short stack, I should probably fold. But let's calculate: If SB is all-in for 16 chips total, then after posting SB 16, they have 0. So the \"raise\" is actually just completing their blind? No, they already posted SB. Maybe they're going all-in with 0 additional? That would mean I need to call 0 more? But it says \"Amount to call: 190\". So that doesn't match.\n\nI think there's a data error. But I have to decide. With Q8 suited and 190 to call into 254 pot, getting about 1.34:1 odds, needing ~43% equity. Q8 suited vs a reasonable SB raising range has less than 43% equity. Against a very wide range maybe 40%. Close, but probably fold. Also, I have only 280 chips (8.8 BB). Calling 190 leaves me with 90 (2.8 BB). If I lose, I'm crippled. If I win, I have 280+254=534? Actually, if I call and win, I get the 254 pot plus my 190 back? No, I get the pot. Pot is 254, I add 190, total 444. If I win, I get 444, net gain 254. My stack would be 280+254=534. If I lose, I have 90 left.\n\nBut actually, the opponent only has 16 chips. So the most I can win from them is 16? Wait, they put in 16 as SB. The pot has 32 from blinds (16+32=48). Plus maybe other dead money? Pot is 254, which includes what? SB 16, BB 32, plus 206 from somewhere? There must be other money. Seat 1 folded but maybe they had antes? No.\n\nActually, let me read: \"Pot: 254 chips\". How? Blinds: 16/32. SB posts 16, BB posts 32. That's 48. Where's the other 206 from? Maybe there are antes? Not mentioned. Or maybe previous action? Only Seat 1 folded. No"

Actually, if I call and win, I get the 254 pot plus my 190 back? No, I get the pot. Pot is 254, I add 190, total 444. If I win, I get 444, net gain 254. My stack would be 280+254=534. If I lose, I have 90 left.\n\nBut actually, the opponent only has 16 chips. So the most I can win from them is 16? Wait, they put in 16 as SB. The pot has 32 from blinds (16+32=48). Plus maybe other dead money? Pot is 254, which includes what? SB 16, BB 32, plus 206 from somewhere? There must be other money. Seat 1 folded but maybe they had antes? No.\n\nActually, let me read: \"Pot: 254 chips\". How? Blinds: 16/32. SB posts 16, BB posts 32. That's 48. Where's the other 206 from? Maybe there are antes? Not mentioned. Or maybe previous action? Only Seat 1 folded. No",

Seat 2 folded. I posted SB 16, so I need to call 16 more to match the BB.\n\nThis is essentially a heads-up situation between me (BB) and Seat 1 (BB). Actually wait: Seat 1 is in the BB? Let me check: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 353 chips\" and \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 32\". So Seat 1 is the BB. I'm in SB? No, I'm Seat 3: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". So I'm BB, Seat 1 posted BB? That seems contradictory. Let me re-read:\n\n\"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 16\" - I posted SB 16\n\"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 32\" - Seat 1 posted BB 32\n\nBut it says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Hmm, maybe the positions are mislabeled? Or maybe it's showing I'm BB but I posted SB? Actually in tournaments, sometimes positions rotate. Let me think: If I'm BB, I should post 32. But I posted 16 as SB. So maybe I'm actually SB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\" but action shows I posted SB. Could be a display issue.\n\nRegardless: Pot is 48 chips (16+32).

Blinds are 16/32. Seat 1 posted SB 16, Seat 2 posted BB 32. Amount to call is 32. Minimum raise to 64. Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nThis is a tournament situation with very short stacks. I have 8.2 BB. ATo on the button is a strong hand in this situation. With both blinds having posted, I'm last to act preflop. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 385 chips (12 BB), Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 238 chips (7.4 BB).\n\nGiven my stack size, I should be looking to either go all-in or raise. ATo is definitely strong enough to play. I should consider raising to put pressure on the blinds. Since I have 8.2 BB, a standard raise would be to 2-2.5 BB, which would be 64-80 chips. But with such short stacks, I might consider going all-in or making a larger raise.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I'm very short-stacked at 8.2 BB. I need to accumulate chips soon. The button is the best position. ATo is a decent hand. Both opponents seem to be similar players (both named Kimi-K2 variations).\n\nI should probably raise. But how much? Minimum raise is to 64 (2 BB total). That would leave me with 200 chips behind (6.25 BB). That's still playable. Or I could go all-in for 264.\n\nGiven the stack sizes, a standard raise might invite calls. An all-in might get folds more often. But ATo might be ahead of the blinds' ranges.\n\nI need to check opponent tendencies. Let me try to recall opponent actions. But I need to respond in JSON format. I'll make a decision based on general poker theory.\n\nWith 8.2 BB on the button with ATo, standard tournament strategy is to either go all-in or make a standard raise. Since I have fold equity and a decent hand, I'll raise. I'll raise to 96 chips (3 BB total, which is a raise of 64 more). That's a reasonable sizing.\n\nActually, let me calculate: My stack is 264. If I raise to 96, I'm putting in 96 total (including the call). That's a raise of 64 over the 32 BB. That leaves 168 behind (5.25 BB). That's okay.\n\nAlternatively, I could go all-in. But with ATo, I might want some fold equity. An all-in might get called by better hands and fold out worse hands. A standard raise might get calls from weaker hands.\n\nI think I'll raise to 96.

My stack is only 168, so I can't call. The only option is to fold.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any rule about going all-in when you can't afford the minimum. The instructions say: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in.\" But that's for raises, not calls. Here it's a call, not a raise.

I should go all-in to maximize fold equity and get value. If I just call, I'll have 4.2 BB left and be out of position postflop. Better to shove. Let me check if I can recall opponent tendencies, but the system wants JSON. I'll make a decision based on basic poker principles. With QQ and 5.2 BB, shoving is standard. Let me calculate: if I shove 168, that's a raise to 168 total. That's legal. I should do that.",

The small blind (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) has only 16 chips total and has raised 222, which is effectively an all-in since they only had 16 chips? Wait, let me check: Seat 2 posted SB of 16, so they had 16 chips total. They raised 222, but that's impossible since they only have 16 chips. Actually, looking at the data: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips. They posted SB 16, so they have 0 left? But the action says \"Seat 2 raise 222\". That seems like a mistake or they're all-in for their remaining stack? Let me think: SB is 16, BB is 32. Seat 2 posted SB 16, so they have 0 chips left. Then they \"raise 222\" - maybe it's showing the total amount they put in? Actually, they can't raise more than they have. Perhaps the 222 is the total pot size? Let me recalculate.\n\nPot: 254 chips. That includes: SB 16, BB 32, and Seat 2 raised to 222 total? Wait, \"Seat 2 raise 222\" likely means they raised to 222 total (including their SB). So they put in 206 more (222 - 16 = 206). But they only have 16 chips total, so that can't be right.\n\nMaybe the chip counts are wrong. Let me read carefully: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips. That's their stack size. They posted SB 16, so they're all-in with their 16 chips. The \"raise 222\" might be a display error. Actually, amount to call: 190. Minimum raise to: 412. That suggests the current bet to call is 190 chips. The pot is 254 chips. If SB posted 16 and BB posted 32, that's 48. Then SB raised... to make total pot 254? Let's calculate: 48 + raise amount = 254. So raise amount = 206. That means SB raised by 206, making their total contribution 16 + 206 = 222. But they only have 16 chips, so they can't raise 206 more. Something is off.\n\nMaybe Seat 2 actually has more chips than shown? Or maybe the 16 chips is after posting SB? Actually, they posted SB 16, so their stack might be 0 now. But the display shows 16 chips as their stack. Could be they started with 16, posted SB 16, now have 0, but the display hasn't updated. The raise 222 is likely the total amount they've put in (all-in for their remaining 0?).\n\nLet me use tools to recall opponent actions to understand Kimi-K2's behavior.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with Jc Td, stack is 168 chips (5.2 BB). Blinds are 16/32. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB 32. Seat 2 folded. I posted SB 16, so I need to call 16 more to match the BB. So essentially I'm completing the blind from SB to BB? Wait, I'm Seat 3, which is BB? Actually the description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". But actions show \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 16\" and \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 32\". That seems contradictory. Let me re-read: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\" but then Seat 3 posted SB 16 and Seat 1 posted BB 32. So maybe the positions are: Seat 3 is SB, Seat 1 is BB? But it says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Could be a mislabel. Let me check: I have 168 chips, blinds 16/32. I posted 16 as SB, need to call 16 more to match BB. So I'm actually in SB facing BB's 32? Wait, Seat 1 posted BB 32. So I'm SB (Seat 3) facing BB (Seat 1). Amount to call is 16 to complete to BB. Minimum raise to 64 total (so raise additional 48). My stack is 168, so I can raise.\n\nI have JTo suited? Jc Td is offsuit. Not a great hand, but in the SB with 5.2 BB stack, I'm short stacked. In tournament poker, with 5.2 BB, I need to be looking for spots to shove or fold. JTo is not great, but maybe I can complete and see a flop? But with such a short stack, I should be thinking push/fold. Let's consider: I have 5.2 BB. If I fold, I'll have 152 chips (4.75 BB) after posting SB. If I call 16, I'll have 136 chips (4.25 BB) and see a flop. But then post-flop play will be awkward with such a short stack. Probably better to either shove or fold preflop.\n\nLet's think about opponent. Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 449 chips (14 BB). They posted BB. They haven't acted yet after my action? Wait, actions: Seat 2 folded. So it's on me (SB) to act. BB has already posted. So I'm facing the decision to complete, raise, or fold.\n\nWith JTo, I'm not thrilled. But with 5.2 BB, I should be shoving a wide range. Let's consider push/fold ranges. Typically with 5 BB, you can shove quite wide from SB vs BB. JTo is probably in the shoving range.

The action: I posted SB 16, opponent posted BB 32, then seat 2 folded. Now it's on me to complete from SB to BB. Amount to call is 16 (to make it 32 total). My stack is 168 chips (5.2 BB). Opponent (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 449 chips.\n\nI need to decide: fold, call, or raise. With JTo, it's a marginal hand. I'm getting good pot odds: need to call 16 into pot of 48, so 1:3 pot odds. That's 25% equity needed. JTo likely has around 40% equity against a random hand. But opponent is in BB, so they could have any two cards.\n\nHowever, I should consider my stack size (5.2 BB) - I'm very short. This might be a spot to go all-in or fold. Calling leaves me with 136 behind (4.25 BB) going to flop out of position. That's not great.\n\nI should check opponent tendencies. But I can't use tools without proper format. Let me think: with 5.2 BB, JTo might be a shove candidate. But opponent has me covered. If I shove, I'd be raising to 168 total. Minimum raise is to 64, so shove is allowed.\n\nPotentially I could call and see a flop, but with such a short stack, playing postflop out of position is tough. JTo plays better multiway, but it's heads-up.\n\nGiven my stack size, I think shoving might be reasonable. Let me consider: if I call 16, pot becomes 64, I have 136 behind. If I check-shove any flop, opponent might call with better hands only. If I shove pre, I might get folds from weaker hands.\n\nActually, with 5.2 BB, standard short stack strategy is push/fold. JTo is borderline but probably a shove from SB vs BB. The BB is getting good odds to call though: they need to call 136 to win 168+48=216, so about 1.6:1 odds (38% equity needed). They might call with a wide range.\n\nBut I need to make a decision. Let me check if there's any info on opponent. I'll try to use the tool correctly.",

Let me check the details again.\n\nSeat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\npreflop: Seat 2 post_sb 16\npreflop: Seat 2 raise 270\n\nThat doesn't make sense - if they have only 16 chips, they can't raise 270.

That would mean they put in 270 total, which is 254 more than their SB. But they only have 16 chips total. This seems like they're going all-in for their remaining stack.\n\nActually, looking at the amounts:\n- SB (Seat 2): 16 chips total\n- They post SB 16 (all their chips)\n- Then they \"raise 270\" - this must be an all-in for their remaining 0? Or maybe the display is wrong.\n\nWait, I should check the actual situation. I have 136 chips. Amount to call: 238. That's more than my entire stack! So I can't call even if I wanted to. The minimum raise to is 508, which is also impossible.\n\nLet me re-read: \"Amount to call: 238\" but my stack is 136. So I can only call 136 max (go all-in). But the action says \"Legal actions: fold, call\". So I can call by going all-in for my remaining 136.\n\nActually, if the SB has only 16 chips and raised 270, that's impossible.

Unless the \"raise 270\" means they're raising to 270 total, which would require 254 more, but they only have 0 left after posting SB.\n\nI think this must be a display issue. Perhaps the SB went all-in for their remaining chips (which would be 0 after posting), but the system shows it as a raise. Or maybe they have more chips than shown.\n\nRegardless, I have Kh 3d.

No, I'm confused.\n\nLet me think mathematically:\n- I've already put in 32 as BB\n- SB posted 16, then raised to 270 total\n- To call, I need to match the 270 total, so I need to put in 238 more (270 - 32 = 238)\n- But I only have 104 left (136 - 32 = 104)\n- So I can't fully call. I can only go all-in for my remaining 104.\n\nBut the interface says \"Legal actions: fold, call\". So \"call\" here means call all-in for my remaining chips.\n\nWith Kh 3d, this is a terrible hand to call an all-in with. Even against a short stack of 16 chips, Kh 3d is weak. But wait, if SB only has 16 chips total, and they're all-in, I'm getting pot odds.\n\nLet me calculate the pot:\n- SB: 16 all-in\n- Me: 32 BB already in\n- Total pot if I call all-in: 16 + 32 + my remaining 104?

That means they put in 254 more, but they only have 0 left. This doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, looking at the pot size: \"Pot: 302 chips\". How did we get to 302 chips? SB 16 + BB 32 = 48. Where does 302 come from? Maybe there are antes or other players? The list shows Seat 4 and 5 have 0 chips and folded. Seat 1 folded. So only SB and me.\n\nWait, maybe the \"raise 270\" means they're raising BY 270, not TO 270. But they only have 16 chips. This is confusing.\n\nLet me check the tournament structure: Blinds: 16/32. So SB is 16, BB is 32.\n\nIf SB has 16 chips and posts SB 16, they're all-in. Then they can't raise. But the action says \"raise 270\". Maybe it's a bug in display.\n\nRegardless, I need to make a decision. With Kh 3d, this is a weak hand. Even against a very short stack, Kh 3d has only about 40% equity against a random hand. But let me consider pot odds.\n\nIf SB is all-in for 16 chips:\n- Pot would be: SB 16 + my BB 32 = 48 chips\n- I need to call additional 0? Actually, if they're all-in for 16, I've already put in 32, so I'm ahead. I would win 16 from them.\n\nBut the amount to call is 238, which suggests there's more money in pot. Pot is 302 chips. How?\n\nMaybe there are antes? Or maybe other players put in money? Let me re-read: \"Players at table: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 481 chips (folded)\". Seat 1 folded preflop. So no money from them.\n\nI'm confused. But I need to make a decision. With Kh 3d, facing what appears to be a large raise (or all-in), I should fold. Even if SB has only 16 chips, calling with Kh 3d is marginal at best.\n\nActually, let me think about tournament situation. I have 136 chips (4.2 BB). I'm very short stacked. SB has 16 chips (0.5 BB). If I fold, I'll have 104 chips left (136 - 32 BB already in = 104). Actually no, if I fold, I lose my 32 BB, so I'll have 104 left (3.25 BB).\n\nIf I call and win, I double up through SB's 16 chips.

Let me think through this carefully.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I'm in the SB with 5d 6s\n- My stack: 120 chips (3.8 BB)\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 366 chips\n- Action: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB 32, Seat 2 raised to 318 (effectively all-in since they have 0 chips? Wait, Seat 2 has 0 chips but they raised? That seems odd - maybe they're all-in with 0 chips? Actually looking at the table: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out). So they're already out. But the action says \"Seat 2 raise 318\". This is confusing. Let me re-read.\n\nPlayers at table:\nSeat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 449 chips\nSeat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\nSeat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 120 chips (me)\nSeat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (folded)\nSeat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (folded)\n\nSo Seat 2 is \"out\" but raised? Maybe this is a mistake or they're all-in? Actually if they have 0 chips, they can't raise. Maybe the display is wrong? Or maybe they had chips when they raised and are now out? Let me check the action sequence:\n- preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 16 (me)\n- preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 32\n- preflop: Seat 2 raise 318\n\nBut Seat 2 has 0 chips. This is contradictory. Unless they went all-in with their last 318 chips and are now shown as 0? But they're listed as \"out\". Very confusing.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: Seat 1 is \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\" and Seat 2 is just \"Kimi-K2\". They might be different players. Seat 2 has 0 chips and is \"out\", meaning they're eliminated. But the action says they raised. This doesn't make sense unless it's a display error.\n\nLet me check the pot size: 366 chips. How did that happen? SB 16 + BB 32 = 48. If Seat 2 raised to 318, that would be 318 total from them. But they have 0 chips. Something is off.\n\nWait, maybe the \"raise 318\" is the total amount Seat 2 put in, not an additional raise? But they have 0 chips. This is very confusing.\n\nLet me think about the actual decision: I have 120 chips total. I've already posted SB of 16, so I have 104 left. The amount to call is 302, but I only have 104 left. So I can't call 302. I can only go all-in with my remaining 104.\n\nActually, let me calculate: My stack: 120 chips. I posted SB 16, so I have 104 left. The pot is 366. The action says \"Amount to call: 302\". But if Seat 2 raised to 318, and I already put in 16, I would need to call 302 more to match the 318 total? But I only have 104 left. So I can only go all-in.\n\nBut the legal actions are \"fold, call\" - not \"all-in\" specifically listed. But if I call, it would be an all-in since I don't have enough chips.\n\nActually, I need to understand the betting: Seat 1 (BB) has 449 chips. Seat 2 raised to 318. I have 120 total. So to call, I'd need to put in 302 more, but I only have 104 left. So I would be all-in for my remaining 104.\n\nThe minimum raise to would be 604, but I can't afford that anyway.\n\nMy hand: 5d 6s - suited connectors but not great. I'm in the SB with a very short stack (3.8 BB). This is a tournament situation.\n\nGiven my extremely short stack, I'm essentially in push/fold territory. With 3.8 BB, I should be looking to get all-in with any decent hand. 56s is not great, but it has some playability post-flop if I double up.\n\nBut I need to consider who raised. Seat 2 raised, but they have 0 chips? This is still confusing. Maybe Seat 2 is actually not out? Or maybe it's Seat 1 who raised? Let me re-examine the action: \"Seat 2 raise 318\". But Seat 2"

Looking at the actions: Seat 2 raised 318, but has 0 chips? That might be a reporting issue.\n\nActually, I need to check: Seat 2 is \"Kimi-K2\" with 0 chips (out), but they just raised 318? That doesn't make sense if they're out. Maybe it's a misprint or Seat 2 is actually still in the hand?\n\nLet me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\" - says they're out. But then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 318\". This is confusing. Perhaps Seat 2 went all-in with their remaining chips? But they have 0 chips according to the listing.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: 366 chips. Blinds are 16/32. I posted SB 16, Seat 1 posted BB 32. That's 48 total. If Seat 2 raised to 318, that would put 318 in from them, plus my 16 SB and Seat 1's 32 BB = 366 total. That checks out.\n\nBut Seat 2 has 0 chips listed. Maybe they went all-in with their last chips? Or it's a display error.\n\nRegardless, I have 120 chips total. I've already put in 16 as SB. Amount to call is 302, but I only have 104 left (120 - 16 = 104). So I can't even call the 302 - I don't have enough chips. I can only go all-in with my remaining 104.\n\nWait, let me calculate: My stack is 120. I already put in 16 as SB. So I have 104 left. The amount to call is 302, which is more than my entire stack.

But I can't call 302 with only 104 left. Unless... in tournament poker, if a player doesn't have enough to call, they can go all-in for their remaining chips. That would be a \"call\" of my remaining stack.\n\nSo I need to decide: fold my 5d6s, or go all-in with my remaining 104 chips.\n\nLet me think about the hand: 5d6s is a weak hand, especially against a raise. But I'm very short-stacked at 3.8 BB. This might be a spot where I need to take a stand.\n\nBut first, let me check opponent tendencies. I'll use the recall tool.",

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB of 32. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 318. Wait, that's confusing - Seat 2 has 0 chips according to the player list but raised 318? Let me check again: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\" - that means they're out of the tournament. But the action says \"Seat 2 raise 318\". That seems contradictory. Maybe it's a misprint or Seat 2 is actually not out? Let me re-read: \"Players at table: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\". So they're out. Yet they raised? That doesn't make sense. Perhaps the action happened before they went out? Or maybe it's Seat 1 who raised? The action says \"Seat 2 raise 318\" but Seat 2 is out. This is confusing.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 449 chips\" and \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\". These are two different players. Seat 2 raised 318, but has 0 chips? That can't be right. Unless they went all-in with their last 318 chips and are now at 0? But it says they have 0 chips and are \"out\". Maybe the chip count is after the raise? If they raised 318 and had 318 chips, they'd be at 0 after raising. That makes sense - they're all-in.\n\nSo Seat 2 raised all-in to 318. I need to call 302 chips. My stack is 120 chips total. Wait, I have 120 chips total. I already posted SB of 16, so I have 104 left. To call 302, I'd need to put in 302 total? Let me calculate: The pot is 366. Amount to call is 302. Minimum raise to is 604. My stack is 120 total. I already put in 16 for SB, so I have 104 left. The amount to call is 302, which is more than my entire stack (120). So I can't call 302 - I can only go all-in for my remaining 104. Actually, if I call, I'd be putting in all my chips since 302 > 120. So I can either fold or go all-in (call).\n\nLegal actions are fold, call. So I can call all-in.\n\nI have 5d6s, a very weak hand. I'm getting pot odds: pot is 366 + 318 (raise) = 684? Let me calculate properly. Current pot: 366. That includes my 16 SB, BB 32, and raise 318? Actually: SB 16 + BB 32 + raise 318 = 366. Yes. If I call all-in for my remaining 104, total pot would be 366 + 104 = 470. But wait, Seat 2 raised to 318, which is more than my stack. They have me covered. So if I call, I'm only putting in 104 more (total 120). The pot would be: SB 16 + BB 32 + my call 104 + their raise 318 = 470. Actually, their raise is 318 total, which includes their 32 BB? No, they raised from BB position? Let's see: Seat 1 posted BB 32. Seat 2 raised 318. That means Seat 2 put in 318 total, which is a raise of 286 over the BB (318 - 32 = 286). So pot is: my SB 16 + BB 32 + raise 318 = 366.\n\nIf I call all-in for 104 more (total 120), pot becomes 366 + 104 = 470. I'm putting in 104 to win 470, giving me pot odds of about 4.5:1. That's good odds, but with 5d6s against what's likely a strong hand (all-in raise), my equity is poor.\n\nI should recall opponent actions to see what Seat 2 tends to raise with.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Tc 2s - This is an extremely weak hand. Ten-high with a 2 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (button) - Good position, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n3. **My stack**: 120 chips (1.9 BB) - Critically short-stacked. I'm essentially in push/fold territory.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 1 (SB): 417 chips, appears to be tight - folded 9 of last 10 hands preflop\n   - Seat 2 (BB): 302 chips, more aggressive - raised 5 of last 10 hands preflop\n\n5. **Action**: It's folded to me on the button. I need to call 64 chips to see a flop, which is more than half my stack (64/120 = 53%). \n\n6. **Pot odds**: Pot is 96 chips, I need to call 64. That's 1.5:1 pot odds (96:64). I need ~40% equity to break even.\n\n7. **Hand equity**: Tc2s has terrible equity against any reasonable range. Even against random cards, it's only ~35% equity. Against the BB's likely raising range, it's much worse.\n\n8. **Tournament situation**: With only 1.9 BB, I need to find a better spot. Calling off more than half my stack with Tc2s is terrible. I should wait for a better hand or position.\n\n9. **Alternatives**: I could consider going all-in, but with Tc2s and only 120 chips total (64 to call + 56 remaining), I'd be risking everything on a terrible hand. The BB has been raising frequently, so they might call with a wide range, but my hand is still terrible.\n\nThe correct play is clearly to fold. I need to preserve my stack for a better opportunity. With only 1.9 BB, I'll have to go all-in soon, but I should do it with a better hand than Tc2s. Even if I were to shove, I'd need to put in my remaining 56 chips after calling 64, making it effectively an all-in for 120 total, but that's still with a terrible hand.\n\nWait, let me check the math again: If I call 64, I'll have 56 left. The pot would be 96 + 64 = 160. Then on the flop, I'd have 56 left with pot of 160. I'd be committed anyway. So it's effectively an all-in decision.\n\nBut with Tc2s, this is an easy fold. I should wait for a better spot. Even random cards would be better than this.\n\nLet me check if there are any antes or other factors... No, just blinds.\n\nGiven the BB's aggressive tendencies, they might not have a strong hand, but my hand is so weak that I'm likely dominated.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Actually, looking at the action: Seat 2 (SB) posted 32, I posted 64 as BB, then Seat 2 raised 128. So total pot is 32 + 64 + 128 = 224? But it says pot is 192 chips. Let me calculate: SB 32 + BB 64 + raise 128 = 224. But maybe the raise amount includes the SB? Seat 2 had to call 32 more to match BB, then raise additional 96? Actually standard: SB posts 32, BB posts 64. Then SB can raise. Minimum raise would be to 128 total (64 + 64). Seat 2 raised 128, which is exactly double the BB. So total pot: SB 32 + BB 64 + raise amount 128 = 224. But display says 192. Maybe the 128 is total amount Seat 2 put in? That would be: SB 32 + additional 96 to make 128 total. Then pot = 64 (BB) + 128 (SB total) = 192. Yes that makes sense: Seat 2 put in 128 total (32 SB + 96 raise). So I need to call 64 more to match the 128 total.\n\nBut I only have 56 chips total. Actually wait: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\". That must be after posting the BB? If I started with 120 chips, posted 64 BB, I'd have 56 left. So I have 56 chips behind, and need to call 64 more. I can only call 56 (all-in). So effectively I'm all-in if I call.\n\nNow, opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising frequently based on history: hand 96 raised 222, 99 raised 270, 100 raised 318. Seems aggressive. My hand 3h5h is terrible, but I'm getting pot odds. Let me calculate: If I call all-in for 56 chips, total pot will be: current 192 + my 56 = 248 chips. I need to put in 56 to win 248, so need ~22.6% equity.\n\nAgainst a random hand, 3h5h has about 38% equity. Even against a tight range like top 20%, it has ~32%. So pot odds justify a call with any two cards given I'm so short. But wait, I'm in a tournament. With 0.9 BB, I'm basically dead anyway. Folding leaves me with 56 chips (0.9 BB) which is essentially zero - I'll be all-in next hand in SB anyway. So I should call with any two cards.\n\nBut let me check if there's any ICM considerations. It's a tournament, but with 0.9 BB, I have no fold equity. Calling gives me a chance to double up to ~1.8 BB, still short but better than 0.9 BB.\n\nActually, wait: If I fold, I have 56 chips. Next hand I'll be SB (32) and BB (64). I'll have to post 32 SB, leaving 24, then be all-in for BB. Actually the blinds are 32/64, so I'd have to post 32 as SB next hand, leaving 24, then be all-in for BB if someone raises. But I might get a walk if everyone folds. Still, very dire.\n\nGiven pot odds and tournament situation, I should call. Even with 3h5h, it's better than folding to have a chance.\n\nBut let me think about opponent's range. From showdowns: they showed 44, 5K, KK, TQ, 2K. Mixed range. They're raising frequently. Could be wide.\n\nDecision: Call all-in. Since I can't afford the full 64, I'll be all-in for my remaining 56.\n\nAction: call (which puts me all-in).\n\nResponse JSON: {\"action\": \"call\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"Stack is 0.9 BB, pot odds justify call with any"

Let me check: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 64\". That seems contradictory. If I have 56 chips and posted BB of 64, I'd be all-in. But maybe the stack is after posting? Let me re-read: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\" - that's my current stack. Blinds are 32/64. I posted BB of 64, so I had 120 chips before posting? Actually if I have 56 chips now, and I posted 64, that means I started with 120 chips? That doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, maybe the stack display is before posting? Let me think: I'm in BB, so I posted 64. My stack shows 56 chips. That means I have 56 chips left after posting the BB? But 56 + 64 = 120, which would be 1.875 BB. Hmm.\n\nActually, looking at the action: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 128\". Seat 2 (SB) posted SB 32, then raised to 128 total. So they put in 32 + 96 raise = 128 total. I need to call 64 more (since I already put in 64 as BB). My stack is 56 chips, so I can only call 56 more? Actually I have 56 chips total, not 56 chips to call. I need to understand my exact chip situation.\n\nLet me check: \"Amount to call: 64\". That means I need to put in 64 more chips. But my stack is only 56 chips. So I can only call 56, which would be all-in. But the interface says \"Legal actions: fold, call\". It doesn't say \"all-in\" but calling would put me all-in since I have less than the call amount.\n\nThis is a tournament situation. I have 0.9 BB effectively. With 3h5h suited, it's a very weak hand. But I'm in the BB, already invested 64 chips. The pot is 192 chips (SB 32 + my BB 64 + raise 96 = 192). I need to call 64 more, but I only have 56 chips. So I'd be all-in for 56 chips.\n\nPot odds: If I call 56, the pot will be 192 + 56 = 248 chips. I'm getting about 4.4:1 pot odds (248:56). That's decent.\n\nBut hand strength: 3h5h is weak, but suited connectors can have some equity. Against a typical SB raising range, what's my equity? Let me think: SB raised from the small blind after everyone folded. Their range could be wide since they're stealing. They might have any two cards.\n\nGiven I have only 0.9 BB left, this is basically a mandatory call. I'm getting good pot odds, and I'm so short stacked that I should take any chance to double up. Even with 3h5h, I have some equity against random cards.\n\nBut let me check opponent tendencies. Seat 2 is \"Kimi-K2\". Let me recall their actions.",

Actually: SB posted 32, BB posted 64, opponent raised 128 total which includes his SB? Wait, let's calculate: SB posted 32, I posted 64, opponent raised to 128 total. So opponent put in 128, which is 96 more than his SB. So pot = 32 + 64 + 128 = 224? No, that can't be right. Let me re-read: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 128\" - this is the total amount he put in. He already posted SB 32, so additional 96. So total pot = SB 32 + BB 64 + raise 96 = 192. Yes.\n- I need to call 64 more chips (but I only have 56 total stack, so I'm all-in for my remaining stack)\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 raises frequently preflop (222, 222, 222, 270, 318 raises seen). Shows down with various hands: 44, K5s, KK, QT, K2. So he raises with a wide range.\n\nMy hand: 3h5h suited. With only 0.9 BB stack, I'm effectively all-in. Pot odds: I need to call 56 chips (my whole stack) to win 192 + 56 = 248 chips? Actually, pot is 192, opponent has bet 128 total (96 more than SB). If I call, I put in 56 more, pot becomes 192 + 56 = 248. I get 248:56 odds, about 4.4:1.\n\nWith 3h5h suited, against a wide raising range, I have decent equity. Suited connectors can hit flushes, straights. Even against a premium hand like AK, I have ~30% equity. Against a wider range, better.\n\nTournament situation: I have 0.9 BB, basically desperate. If I fold, I'll have 56 chips (0.9 BB) next hand in SB, forced to post 32, leaving 24 chips (0.375 BB). Very dire.\n\nGiven pot odds and stack situation, calling is correct.

I'm in the BB according to the header, but actions show Seat 3 (me) posted SB 32, and Seat 1 posted BB 64. This is confusing. Let me check the table setup: 5 seats, but seats 4 and 5 have 0 chips and folded. So only 3 players: Seat 1 (353 chips), Seat 2 (278 chips, folded), and me Seat 3 (208 chips). Blinds are 32/64.\n\nThe actions: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 32, Seat 1 post_bb 64, Seat 2 fold. So I posted SB 32, Seat 1 posted BB 64. That means I'm SB, Seat 1 is BB. But the header says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". That's contradictory. However, the \"Amount to call: 32\" makes sense if I'm SB: I've posted 32, need to call 32 more to match BB's 64.\n\nThus, I'm SB with 9c9d, stack 208 chips (3.2 BB). I've already posted 32, so I have 176 left. Pot is 96 (32+64). It's heads-up against BB. I need to decide: fold, call 32, or raise to at least 128 total.\n\nMy hand: pocket 9s is a decent hand, especially heads-up. With only 3.2 BB effective stack (my stack is 208, BB is 64, so 3.25 BB actually). Actually, my stack is 208, BB is 64, so I have 3.25 BB. That's extremely short-stacked. Pocket 9s is a premium hand with such a short stack. I should be looking to get all-in preflop.\n\nBut let's consider: if I raise, minimum raise to 128 total. That would be putting 128 total, meaning I raise 96 more (since I've already put 32). That would leave me with 80 chips (208-128). Then BB could call or raise. If BB calls, pot would be 256 (96+96+64? Let's calculate: my raise to 128 total, BB has already put 64, needs to call additional 64 to match my 128. So pot would be 128+128=256). If BB raises, I'd have to call remaining 80 chips.\n\nGiven my short stack, I should probably go all-in. But legal actions don't include all-in? Actually, I can raise to any amount up to my stack. Minimum raise to 128, but I can raise more, up to 208 (my total stack). With pocket 9s and 3.25 BB, going all-in is standard.\n\nBut let me think about opponent tendencies. I should use tools to recall opponent actions. Let me search for Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) behavior. Use recall_opponent_actions.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to provide a JSON response with action, raise_to, and reasoning. But first I should analyze the hand properly. Let me think through the situation without using tools since the system is complaining about format.\n\nI have 9c9d. Stack is 208 chips (3.2 BB). Blinds 32/64. Pot is 96. I need to call 32. Minimum raise to 128 total. Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nI'm likely in SB position based on actions (posted SB 32). Opponent in BB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 353 chips.\n\nWith pocket 9s, this is a strong hand heads-up. My stack is short (3.2 BB). In tournament poker with short stack, pocket 9s is a premium hand. I should be looking to get all-in preflop. Folding is not an option. Calling is okay but raising is better to build pot and potentially take it down preflop.\n\nIf I raise, minimum raise to 128 total. That would be putting 128 total, meaning I raise 96 more on top of the 32 I already posted? Actually I've posted 32 SB, so to raise to 128 total, I need to put 96 more (32+96=128). That leaves me with 112 chips (208-96). That's a significant portion of my stack. Alternatively, I could go all-in for 208 total. But legal actions only show raise, not all-in specifically. But I can raise to any amount up to my stack. Minimum raise to 128, maximum 208.\n\nGiven my short stack, pushing all-in is standard with 99. The opponent has me covered. If I raise to 128, I'm committing more than half my stack anyway, so might as well go all-in to maximize fold equity and avoid playing postflop with awkward stack.\n\nBut let me consider: if I raise to 128, opponent might call or raise. If they call, pot will be 128 (my raise) + 64 (their BB) + 32 (my SB) = 224? Wait recalc: Pot currently 96 (32 SB + 64 BB). If I raise to 128 total, I put 96 more (since I already put 32). Total pot becomes 96 + 96 = 192. Opponent needs to call 64 more (128 total - 64 they already put). So pot would be 192 + 64 = 256 if they call. I'd have 112 left behind. That's awkward for postflop play.\n\nBetter to go all-in for 208 total. That's a raise of 176 more (208-32). Pot would be 96 + 176 = 272. Opponent needs to call 144 more (208-64). They have 353 chips, so they can call.\n\nWith 99 and 3.2 BB stack, all-in is correct. Let me check if there are any tournament considerations. We're in a tournament, short stack. Need to accumulate chips. 99 is strong enough to go all-in.\n\nI'll go all-in. Let me structure the JSON response.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to think about this situation. I'm on the button with 6s 9d, which is a weak hand. My stack is 304 chips (4.8 BB), which is very short. The blinds are 32/64, so I have about 4.8 BB. Looking at the opponent actions, Kimi-K2 in seat 2 (the BB) has been raising frequently from what I can see - raises in hands 94, 96, 99, 100, and 102. They seem to be aggressive.\n\nHowever, I'm on the button with only the SB and BB left to act. The SB has 321 chips, BB has 214 chips. With 6s 9d, this is a terrible hand to play, especially with such a short stack. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call.\n\nIf I call 64 chips, that's 21% of my stack going in with a weak hand. The pot would be 160 chips (96 + 64). Then I'd have 240 chips left, which is 3.75 BB. I'd be out of position post-flop if the SB calls or raises.\n\nBetter to either shove or fold. Given my hand strength (6-9 offsuit), folding is probably correct. I could consider shoving as a steal attempt since I'm on the button and the blinds might fold, but with 4.8 BB, a shove would be 304 total. The BB only has 214, so they'd be calling for their tournament life if they call. The SB has 321.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: BB has 214 (3.34 BB), SB has 321 (5 BB). If I shove 304, BB would need to call 150 more (214 - 64 already posted) to win 458 (96 + 304). That's about 2.3:1 pot odds, which is good. They might call with a wide range.\n\nWith 6-9 offsuit, I don't want to get called. The fold equity might be decent since I'm shoving from the button, but my hand is so weak that if I get called, I'm likely dominated.\n\nGiven my short stack, I should be looking for better spots. There are only 3 players at the table (SB, BB, and me), so blinds come around quickly. I might get a better hand soon.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. Let me check if there are any other considerations. The SB hasn't acted yet - they could raise. If I call and then SB raises, I'd be in a tough spot.\n\nFolding seems best. Let me also check my own hand history to see if I've been playing aggressively or passively.",

Better to take initiative with my short stack than check and likely fold on flop.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the BB with 9s Tc. My stack is 240 chips (3.8 BB). The blinds are 32/64. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted SB 32 and then called 32 more, so they've put in 64 total. I've already posted BB 64. The pot is 128 chips. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nI should check my opponent's tendencies. From the search results, I see Kimi-K2 has been raising preflop in several hands (96, 99, 100, 102). In hand 102, they raised to 128 from SB when I was BB with 3h5h and I called. That hand I won with a straight. In this hand, they just called from SB instead of raising. That's interesting - they have 492 chips (7.7 BB), which is a decent stack compared to mine (3.8 BB).\n\nMy hand is 9s Tc, which is a weak hand but not terrible for defending the BB. Given my short stack (3.8 BB), I need to consider push/fold ranges. With 3.8 BB, I should be looking to shove with a wider range when facing a limp. But here the SB limped, so I'm getting a free look at the flop if I check.\n\nHowever, I should consider raising. The minimum raise is to 128 (doubling the BB). That would put 64 more chips in (128 total). My stack would then be 176 behind. If I raise and get called, the pot would be 256 and I'd have 176 behind (less than pot).\n\nActually, with 3.8 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. 9T suited is actually a decent hand to shove with against a limp from SB. The SB has shown aggression with raises, but here they limped, which suggests weakness.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations. I'm very short (3.8 BB). I need to accumulate chips soon. Checking to see a flop with 9T suited is okay, but if I miss the flop, I'll have to fold to any bet. If I shove now, I might get folds from weak limping hands.\n\nWait, I need to check the exact stack sizes and pot odds. If I shove for my remaining 176 (240 - 64 already in), the pot would be 128 + 176 = 304. They'd have to call 176 to win 304, giving them 1.73:1 odds (36.5% equity needed). They have 492 chips, so calling 176 would leave them with 316.\n\n9T suited has about 40% equity against a random hand. Against a typical limping range from SB (maybe 22-99, suited connectors, weak aces, etc.), it might have similar or better equity.\n\nActually, I should check. The SB limped, which often means a weak hand trying to see a cheap flop. They might fold to a shove. If they call, I have decent equity.\n\nGiven my desperate stack size (3.8 BB), I think shoving is correct. Checking is too passive and I'll likely have to fold on most flops.\n\nBut wait, I need to see if \"raise\" is a legal action. Yes, it is. The minimum raise to is 128. I could raise to 128 (putting in 64 more), but that leaves me with 176 behind and creates a weird SPR. Actually, with 3.8 BB, just shoving is probably better.\n\nLet me calculate: if I raise to 128 (put 64 more), pot is 192. They'd have to call 64 more. If they call, pot is 256, I have 176 behind. Then postflop, any bet I make will be committing. So I might as well shove now.\n\nYes, with 3.8 BB, jamming is standard with a wide range. 9T suited is definitely in my jamming range against a limp.\n\nI'll shove. Raise_to should be 240 (my total stack).",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: Ks 5c (off-suit King-5)\n- Position: SB (small blind)\n- My stack: 336 chips (5.2 BB)\n- Pot: 224 chips\n- Action: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 128 total (64 more than BB)\n- Amount to call: 96 chips\n- BB (Seat 1) has only 11 chips left\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength:** K5o is a weak hand, especially from the SB. King-5 offsuit has poor playability postflop.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm in the worst position (SB) and will be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes:** \n   - I have 336 chips (5.2 BB)\n   - Seat 2 (raiser) has 364 chips\n   - Seat 1 (BB) has only 11 chips and will likely fold or go all-in\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the recall, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raises frequently preflop. Looking at their raises: 128, 318, 270, 222, 222, 222, 378, 96, 250, 234. They seem to be an aggressive player. Their showdown hands include K2, 88, Q7 - so they're raising with a wide range.\n\n5. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 224, I need to call 96. That's 2.33:1 pot odds (30% equity needed). K5o vs a typical raising range has about 35-40% equity, but being out of position reduces that.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** With only 5.2 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. However, I have position on the BB who has only 11 chips and will likely fold. This creates a heads-up situation against the raiser.\n\n7. **Alternative Options:** \n   - Fold: Preserve my stack for a better spot\n   - Call: See a flop with marginal odds, but out of position\n   - Raise: With K5o, raising seems too aggressive\n\n**Decision:** I should fold. K5o from the SB is too weak to call a raise, especially when I'll be out of position. The pot odds are decent (30% equity needed), but postflop play will be difficult with this hand. With only 5.2 BB, I should wait for a better spot to get my chips in.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any ICM pressure or bubble situation... The BB has only 11 chips, so they're essentially all-in blind next hand. This might create some fold equity if I raise, but with K5o, that's too speculative.\n\nActually, wait - the BB has 11 chips. If I call 96, the pot becomes 320. The BB only has 11 chips, so they can only call 11 more. This creates a side pot situation. But still, K5o is too weak.\n\nI'll fold and preserve my stack for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 7h Kd, with 304 chips (4.8 BB). I've posted the small blind of 32, and the big blind (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) has posted 64. So I need to call 32 more to match the big blind.\n\nFrom the opponent data, I can see Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been quite active preflop, raising frequently. In recent hands, they raised to 128 in hand #106, called in hand #105, and raised in several others. They have 503 chips (7.9 BB), so they have me covered.\n\nMy hand, K7o, is weak - especially offsuit. I'm on the button, which is good position, but with such a short stack (4.8 BB), I need to consider push/fold ranges. With K7o, this is a marginal hand for pushing from the button when facing just the big blind.\n\nLooking at pot odds: I need to call 32 to win a pot of 96 (my 32 SB + their 64 BB). That's 1:3 pot odds, or 25% equity needed. K7o has about 55% equity against a random hand, so mathematically it's a call. However, the BB might not have a random hand - they might defend with a tighter range.\n\nGiven my stack size of 4.8 BB, I should be looking to shove or fold preflop rather than call. Calling leaves me with 4.3 BB postflop, which is awkward. With K7o, this is probably a fold or shove decision.\n\nLet me check if there are any antes - no, just blinds. With 4.8 BB, standard short stack strategy would be to push with a wider range from the button against a single BB. K7o is borderline but probably a shove against an unknown opponent.\n\nHowever, I have data on this opponent. They've been raising frequently preflop, but they've also folded to aggression. In hand #105, they called a raise from me (when I had 9s Tc and raised from BB). \n\nActually, looking at the situation: I've already posted 32 as SB. If I fold, I lose 32. If I call, I put in 32 more (total 64) and see a flop with 240 behind (3.75 BB). If I shove, I put in my remaining 272 (304 total).\n\nThe minimum raise is to 128, which would be 96 more (32 call + 64 raise). That leaves me with 208 behind (3.25 BB).\n\nGiven my stack size, shoving seems reasonable. K7o has decent equity against a BB's calling range. The BB has to call 240 more to win 368 (304 my stack + 64 their BB), getting about 1.5:1 odds. They'd need about 40% equity to call.\n\nLet me think about the opponent's likely calling range. They have 503 chips, so calling my shove doesn't put them at risk. They might call with a wide range given the odds.\n\nActually, wait - I need to consider that I'm not facing a raise. The BB has just posted, so I can complete the small blind or raise. With K7o from the button against a single BB, I think the best play is to shove. Calling is bad because it leaves me with an awkward stack postflop.\n\nLooking at recent hands: In hand #103, I raised with 99 from SB and won. In hand #105, I raised with T9o from BB and won. So I've been aggressive with marginal hands.\n\nI think shoving is the right play here. Let me calculate: If I shove for 304 total, the BB has to call 240 more (304 - 64 they already have in). They're getting 368:240 or about 1.53:1, needing ~39.5% equity.\n\nK7o has about 60% equity against a random hand. Against a top 40% range, it has about 52% equity. Against a top 30% range, about 48%. So it's close.\n\nBut tournament-wise, I'm very short at 4.8 BB. I need to accumulate chips soon. The button is the best position. I think shoving is correct.\n\nActually, I should check if \"raise\" is in my legal actions. Yes, it is. I can raise to any amount up to my stack.\n\nI'll shove all-in.",

K7o is not a great hand, but with only 4.8 BB and being on the button against a single blind, this is a standard shove spot in tournament poker. The BB has to defend very wide when I'm this short.

My stack is only 32 chips (0.5 BB), which is all-in preflop as I posted SB 32 and raised 304? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me parse the situation.\n\nMy stack: 32 chips (0.5 BB). Blinds: 32/64. I posted SB 32, opponent posted BB 64. I raised 304? That can't be right since I only have 32 chips total. Actually, looking at actions: preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32, Seat 2 post_bb 64, Seat 3 raise 304, Seat 2 call 240. But I only have 32 chips total. Something seems off.\n\nWait, maybe the stack sizes are current after posting? Let me think: My stack is 32 chips. I posted SB 32, so I'm all-in preflop with my 32 chips. But the action says I raised 304. That must be a mistake or misunderstanding. Perhaps the 304 is the total pot? Or maybe I'm misreading.\n\nActually, re-reading: \"Your Stack: 32 chips (0.5 BB)\" - that's my current stack. But I already posted SB 32, so I have 0 chips left? No, wait, if I have 32 chips and post SB 32, then I have 0 chips left. But then I can't raise. Something is inconsistent.\n\nLet me check the pot: 608 chips. That's large. Preflop: SB 32 + BB 64 + my \"raise\" 304 + opponent's call 240 = 640 total? Actually 32+64+304+240=640, close to 608 (maybe some rounding).\n\nI think the key point: I have 32 chips total, which is 0.5 BB. I'm essentially all-in preflop with my 32 chips. The flop came Js 4s 9s. Opponent checked. I have Kd 7h, no spade. Board has three spades. I have nothing - no pair, no draw. My hand is terrible.\n\nBut wait, I'm already all-in preflop with my 32 chips. The action says \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check\". Since I'm all-in, I can't bet more. I should just check and see the turn and river.\n\nBut can I fold? If I'm all-in, I can't fold - my money is already in. But the interface says fold is a legal action. Maybe I can fold on the flop even though I'm all-in? That doesn't make sense in poker. Once you're all-in, you're committed.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding: Maybe my stack is 32 chips AFTER posting SB? So I have 32 chips left, not all-in. But then I posted SB 32, which would leave me with 0. Hmm.\n\nLet me use tools to understand better. First, let me recall my recent hands to see similar situations.",

          "reasoning_content": "Looking at the current situation:\n\n- I'm on the BTN with 7h Kd\n- My stack is only 32 chips (0.5 BB) - I'm essentially all-in\n- Board is Js 4s 9s (three spades)\n- Pot is 608 chips\n- Opponent (Seat 2) has checked\n- I have 0 chips left, so I'm effectively all-in already\n- My only legal actions are fold or check\n\nThis is an interesting spot. I have K7 offsuit on a Js 4s 9s board. I have no spade, so I'm not on a flush draw. I have a gutshot straight draw (10 would give me a straight with K-Q-10-9-8? Actually no, I have K7, so I need 10-8-6-5? Let me think: Board is J-9-4, I have K-7. Best possible straight would be K-Q-J-10-9 or maybe 10-9-8-7-6? Actually with K7 on J94 board, I have no realistic straight draw.\n\nMy hand is weak: King high with no pair, no flush draw, no good draws. However, I'm already all-in with my last 32 chips. The pot is 608 chips, and opponent has checked. If I check, we go to the turn and river, and I might get lucky.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They seem to be fairly active with raises preflop. They called my preflop raise of 304 (I put in 304 total, which was essentially my whole stack minus the SB). They called with 240 more.\n\nGiven that I'm already all-in and the pot is huge relative to my stack (608 vs my 32), folding makes no sense. I should check and see the next cards. I have nothing to lose - I'm already all-in.\n\nWait, but I can still fold? Actually no, I'm already all-in. My stack is 0, I have no more chips to put in. The \"fold\" option would mean forfeiting the hand, but I'm already all-in. I should check to see the turn and river.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: \"Your Stack: 32 chips (0.5 BB)\" - but I already put in my SB of 32 and raised to 304? Wait, that doesn't add up. Let me re-read:\n\n- preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32 (that's me)\n- preflop: Seat 2 post_bb 64  \n- preflop: Seat 3 raise 304 (that's me raising to 304 total)\n- preflop: Seat 2 call 240\n\nSo I had 32 chips, posted SB of 32, then raised to 304? That doesn't make sense if I only have 32 total. Unless there's something about tournament chips? Actually, maybe \"Your Stack: 32 chips\" means I have 32 chips remaining after posting SB? Let me think:\n\nStarting stack: unknown\nI post SB 32\nI raise to 304 total\nBut if I only have 32 total, I can't raise to 304.\n\nActually, looking at the action: \"Seat 3 raise 304\" - this might mean I raised by 304 more? But that would be 32 (SB) + 304 = 336 total, which I don't have.\n\nHmm, maybe the stack display is wrong or there's tournament mechanics. Regardless, the key point: I'm facing a check on the flop, and my only legal actions are fold or check. With a pot of 608 and my hand, even though it's weak, I should check and see what happens. Folding when checked to would be terrible.\n\nActually wait - I might be misunderstanding. If I'm already all-in, then checking is automatic? But the system is giving me fold/check as options. I should check.\n\nMy reasoning: I have King-high, which might be the best hand if opponent missed completely. The board is Js 4s 9s - all spades. Opponent checked, which could mean weakness. I have no spade, so no flush draw. But checking costs nothing and I get to see two more cards. Folding would forfeit any chance to win the pot.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 0.5 BB left essentially. This is a do-or-die situation. I should check and hope to improve or have my King-high hold up.\n\nLet me check opponent's showdown history to see what they call with. From the data: They showed down with some weak hands like K2, Q7, etc. They might have called my preflop raise with a wide range.\n\nI'll check.",

Let me check: My stack is 32 chips, I posted SB 32, so I had 0 left. But then I raised 304? That seems impossible. Maybe the display is wrong or I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read: \"Your Stack: 32 chips (0.5 BB)\". Actually, I think I have 32 chips total. I posted SB 32, so I'm all-in preflop. But then it says I raised 304. That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the stack display is at the river? Let me trace: Preflop: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 32. Seat 2 post_bb 64. Then I raise 304. But I only have 32 chips total. Unless I had more chips earlier and lost some? Let me check the pot size: 608 chips. That's consistent with: SB 32 + BB 64 + my raise 304 + opponent call 240? Actually opponent call 240. Let me calculate: SB 32, BB 64, my raise 304, opponent call 240. Total: 32+64+304+240 = 640? Actually 32+64=96, +304=400, +240=640. But pot is 608. Hmm.\n\nMaybe the raise 304 includes my SB? So I put in total 304, which includes my 32 SB plus 272 more? And opponent called 240, which is the difference between 304 and 64? Actually BB is 64, so to call my raise, opponent needs to put in 304-64=240. That matches.\n\nSo I effectively went all-in preflop with 32 chips? Wait, but I raised to 304 total. That means I had more than 32 chips. The stack display of 32 chips must be my current stack at river? But if I raised to 304 preflop, I would have put in 304 chips. That would be more than 32. So maybe the stack display is wrong, or I'm misreading.\n\nLet me think: I'm DeepSeek-V3.2 with 32 chips. That's 0.5 BB. I posted SB 32, so I'm all-in. But then I raised 304? That's impossible. Unless the stack is after posting SB? Actually, if I have 32 chips total, posting SB 32 leaves me with 0. So I can't raise. So the raise must have happened earlier when I had more chips. Maybe the stack display is my remaining stack after the preflop action? But then I would have negative chips.\n\nI think there's a misunderstanding. Let me look at the hand history: I'm seat 3, posted SB 32. Opponent seat 2 posted BB 64. Then I raised 304. That means I put in 304 total, which is 272 more than my SB. So I must have had at least 304 chips preflop. But now my stack is 32 chips. So maybe I lost chips in this hand? Or the stack display is my remaining stack after the raise? If I raised to 304, and started with X chips, then after raising I have X-304 left. But it says my stack is 32 chips. So X = 336 chips. That makes sense: I started with 336 chips, posted SB 32, raised to 304 total (put in 272 more), leaving me with 336-304=32 chips. Yes! That's it. So I have 32 chips left after the preflop raise.\n\nSo preflop: I raised to 304 (all-in for effective stack? Actually I have 32 left). Opponent called 240. So the main pot is: my 304 + opponent's 304 = 608? Wait, opponent called 240, but they had to match my 304 total. They already had 64 BB in, so they added 240 to make it 304. So pot is 304+304=608. That matches.\n\nSo now on river: Board is Js 4s 9s 5s Ks - all spades. I have 7h Kd. So I have a pair of Kings with 7 kicker. But board has 4 spades, and the Ks is on board. So"

Js, 4s, 9s, 5s, Ks - all five cards are spades. That's a flush on board for everyone. So my hand is just Kd with 7h kicker. Actually wait: if all five board cards are spades, then everyone has a flush - the board flush. So the best hand is the highest spade on board, which is Ks (King of spades). Since Ks is on board, everyone shares that. So the winning hand would be determined by the next highest card. Actually in Texas Hold'em, if there's a flush on board, players can only play the board. So everyone has a flush, and the flush is the board cards. Since all five are spades, the best possible hand is the board itself: Ks Js 9s 5s 4s. That's a King-high flush.\n\nMy hand: 7h Kd. I have Kd, but that's not a spade. So I'm playing the board: Ks Js 9s 5s 4s. My Kd doesn't help because it's not a spade. My 7h is not a spade. So I only have the board. So my hand is King-high flush using the board.\n\nOpponent could have a spade in their hand. If they have any spade, they have a flush too, but it would be the same board flush unless they have a spade higher than 7? Actually wait: if opponent has a spade, their flush would be: their spade + the four highest spades on board. Since board has Ks, Js, 9s, 5s, 4s. If opponent has As (Ace of spades), their flush would be As Ks Js 9s 5s - Ace-high flush, which beats my King-high flush (board). If opponent has Qs, their flush would be Ks Qs Js 9s 5s - King-high flush with Q kicker, which beats my King-high flush with J kicker (board). Actually board is Ks Js 9s 5s 4s. If opponent has Qs, their best five would be Ks Qs Js 9s 5s (using their Qs and dropping the 4s). That's King-high with Q kicker vs my King-high with J kicker (board). So Qs beats board.\n\nIf opponent has Ts (10 of spades), their best five would be Ks Js Ts 9s 5s (dropping 4s). That's King-high with J kicker, same as board? Actually board: Ks Js 9s 5s 4s. With Ts: Ks Js Ts 9s 5s. Compare: Ks same, Js same, Ts vs 9s: Ts is higher than 9s, so Ts hand wins. Actually wait, need to compare all five cards: Board: K, J, 9, 5, 4. With Ts: K, J, T, 9, 5. So third card T vs 9: T wins. So Ts beats board.\n\nIf opponent has 8s, 7s, 6s, 3s, 2s - these are all lower than the lowest board spade (4s). Actually 8s is higher than 4s. Let's check: If opponent has 8s, their best five: Ks Js 9s 8s 5s (dropping 4s). That's K, J, 9, 8, 5 vs board's K, J, 9, 5, 4. Compare: K same, J same, 9 same, 8 vs 5: 8 wins? Actually fourth card: 8 vs 5: 8 wins. So 8s beats board.\n\nIf opponent has 7s: Ks Js 9s 7s 5s vs Ks Js 9s 5s 4s. Compare: K same, J same, 9 same, 7 vs 5: 7 wins.

          "content": "Now I need to think about my decision. I'm on the river with board showing all spades: Js 4s 9s 5s Ks. I have 7h Kd. The board has a flush (all spades). My hand is just the board - King-high flush. Opponent checked to me. I can check or fold. Checking will go to showdown.\n\nI have only 32 chips left (0.5 BB). The pot is 608 chips. I'm already all-in preflop essentially (I have 32 chips left after my raise). Actually wait, I raised to 304 preflop, leaving me with 32 chips. So I have 32 chips behind. On river, I can check for free.\n\nGiven the board has all spades, if opponent has any spade in their hand, they beat me (since any spade gives them a better flush than the board). If opponent has no spade, we split the pot (both playing the board).\n\nFrom opponent's preflop calling range: They called my raise of 304 total. They had to call 240 more (since they already had 64 BB in). They have 263 chips total stack. So they called a significant raise. What hands would they call with? Possibly pairs, suited connectors, maybe Ace-x suited. They might have a spade in their hand.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've called preflop raises many times. Showdowns show they had hands like Td Qc, 2h Kd, 8c 8s, Qh 7c, 2d Kc. None of these are particularly strong hands. They called with Q7o, K2o, etc. So they call wide.\n\nThe board has Ks. I have Kd. If opponent has a King with no spade, we split. If opponent has a spade, they win. What's the probability they have a spade? There are 13 spades total. Board has 5 spades. My hand has 0 spades. So 8 spades left in deck. Opponent has 2 cards. Probability they have at least one spade is roughly 1 - (39/47 * 38/46) \u2248 1 - (0.83 * 0.826) \u2248 1 - 0.685 = 0.315 or 31.5%. Actually more precisely: 47 cards unknown (52 total - 5 board - 0 in my hand? Wait, I have 2 cards, so 52-5-2=45 unknown cards. 8 spades left. So probability opponent has at least one spade: 1 - (37/45 * 36/44) = 1 - (0.822 * 0.818) = 1 - 0.672 = 0.328 or 32.8%.\n\nSo about 2/3 of the time we split, 1/3 of the time I lose. If we split, I get half of 608 = 304 chips. I already have 304 in the pot. Actually the pot is 608, which is my 304 + opponent's 304. If we split, we each get back 304. So I break even on my investment. If I lose, I lose my 304.\n\nExpected value: 0.672 * 304 + 0.328 * 0 = 204.3 chips. I invested 304, so expected loss of about 100 chips. But wait, that's if we go to showdown. Actually if I check, we go to showdown. If I fold, I forfeit my claim to the pot. But I've already invested 304 chips. Folding now would give up any chance to win. Since I can check for free, I should check and hope to split. Folding would guarantee I lose my 304.\n\nActually let me think: The pot is 608. If we split, I get 304 back. That's what I already put in. So I break even. If I lose, I get 0. So expected value of checking is 0.672 * 304 + 0.328 * 0 = 204.3. My investment is 304, so expected loss is 99.7 chips.\n\nBut if I fold, I get 0 for sure. So checking has higher EV than folding (204.3 vs 0). So I should check.\n\nBut wait, there's also chance opponent is bluffing? No, they checked. They might have missed everything. But with this board, if they have no spade, they're just playing the board like me.\n\nActually, I should consider that opponent might have been slow-playing a flush. They checked flop, turn, river. If they had a spade, they might bet for value. But they checked"

I have 32 chips remaining. Opponent checked to me. I can check or fold. There's no bet to call, so I can't call. Only fold or check.\n\nMy hand: pair of Kings with 7 kicker, but board has flush (all spades). Actually all five board cards are spades, so the board itself is a flush. In Texas Hold'em, if there's a flush on board, players can only play the board cards for the flush. My Kd and 7h are not spades, so I'm playing the board: Ks Js 9s 5s 4s - a King-high flush.\n\nOpponent could have any spade in their hand to make a better flush. Even a low spade like 2s would give them: their spade + four highest board spades. For example with 2s: Ks Js 9s 5s 4s (same as board) - actually 2s is lower than 4s, so board cards are Ks Js 9s 5s 4s, opponent's best five would be Ks Js 9s 5s 4s (dropping 2s). So same as board. But with any spade higher than 4s, they have a better flush. Actually let's think: board has 4s, 5s, 9s, Js, Ks. Any spade higher than 4s would replace the 4s in their hand. So As, Ks (but Ks is on board), Qs, Ts, 8s, 7s, 6s, 5s (but 5s is on board), etc. Actually if they have 5s, that's on board already. If they have 6s: their best five would be Ks Js 9s 6s 5s (dropping 4s). That's better than board's Ks Js 9s 5s 4s because 6s > 4s.\n\nSo any spade 6s or higher (except 5s and Ks which are on board) gives them a better flush. 5s is on board, so having 5s doesn't help. Ks is on board. So only spades 6s, 7s, 8s, Ts, Qs, As would give them a better flush. Also Js, 9s, 4s are on board.\n\nWhat about 2s, 3s? 2s and 3s are lower than 4s, so they wouldn't replace any board card. Their best five would still be the board. So with 2s or 3s, we chop.\n\nBut opponent called my preflop raise. I raised to 304 chips preflop. What range would call? I should recall opponent actions. Let me use the recall tool.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to think about my decision. I'm on the river with board showing all spades: Js 4s 9s 5s Ks. I have 7h Kd. The board has a flush (all spades). My hand is just the board - King-high flush. Opponent checked to me. I can check or fold. Checking will go to showdown.\n\nI have only 32 chips left (0.5 BB). The pot is 608 chips. I'm already all-in preflop essentially (I have 32 chips left after my raise). Actually wait, I raised to 304 preflop, leaving me with 32 chips. So I have 32 chips behind. On river, I can check for free.\n\nGiven the board has all spades, if opponent has any spade in their hand, they beat me (since any spade gives them a better flush than the board). If opponent has no spade, we split the pot (both playing the board).\n\nFrom opponent's preflop calling range: They called my raise of 304 total. They had to call 240 more (since they already had 64 BB in). They have 263 chips total stack. So they called a significant raise. What hands would they call with? Possibly pairs, suited connectors, maybe Ace-x suited. They might have a spade in their hand.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've called preflop raises many times. Showdowns show they had hands like Td Qc, 2h Kd, 8c 8s, Qh 7c, 2d Kc. None of these are particularly strong hands. They called with Q7o, K2o, etc. So they call wide.\n\nThe board has Ks. I have Kd. If opponent has a King with no spade, we split. If opponent has a spade, they win. What's the probability they have a spade? There are 13 spades total. Board has 5 spades. My hand has 0 spades. So 8 spades left in deck. Opponent has 2 cards. Probability they have at least one spade is roughly 1 - (39/47 * 38/46) \u2248 1 - (0.83 * 0.826) \u2248 1 - 0.685 = 0.315 or 31.5%. Actually more precisely: 47 cards unknown (52 total - 5 board - 0 in my hand? Wait, I have 2 cards, so 52-5-2=45 unknown cards. 8 spades left. So probability opponent has at least one spade: 1 - (37/45 * 36/44) = 1 - (0.822 * 0.818) = 1 - 0.672 = 0.328 or 32.8%.\n\nSo about 2/3 of the time we split, 1/3 of the time I lose. If we split, I get half of 608 = 304 chips. I already have 304 in the pot. Actually the pot is 608, which is my 304 + opponent's 304. If we split, we each get back 304. So I break even on my investment. If I lose, I lose my 304.\n\nExpected value: 0.672 * 304 + 0.328 * 0 = 204.3 chips. I invested 304, so expected loss of about 100 chips. But wait, that's if we go to showdown. Actually if I check, we go to showdown. If I fold, I forfeit my claim to the pot. But I've already invested 304 chips. Folding now would give up any chance to win. Since I can check for free, I should check and hope to split. Folding would guarantee I lose my 304.\n\nActually let me think: The pot is 608. If we split, I get 304 back. That's what I already put in. So I break even. If I lose, I get 0. So expected value of checking is 0.672 * 304 + 0.328 * 0 = 204.3. My investment is 304, so expected loss is 99.7 chips.\n\nBut if I fold, I get 0 for sure. So checking has higher EV than folding (204.3 vs 0). So I should check.\n\nBut wait, there's also chance opponent is bluffing? No, they checked. They might have missed everything. But with this board, if they have no spade, they're just playing the board like me.\n\nActually, I should consider that opponent might have been slow-playing a flush. They checked flop, turn, river. If they had a spade, they might bet for value. But they checked",

          "content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with Qc6d, which is a weak hand. My stack is 272 chips (4.2 BB). The opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 535 total, which is a massive overbet - they started with only 32 chips (the SB) and are essentially going all-in with their remaining 503 chips (since they posted 32 SB, they have 503 more to make it 535 total). Actually, wait: seat 2 had 32 chips total? No, looking at the player list: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 32 chips\". That means they only had 32 chips total, and they posted SB of 32, so they're all-in with 0 left. Actually, they raised 535, but they only have 32 chips? That doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 32 chips\". And \"preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 32\". So they posted 32 as SB, leaving them with 0 chips. Then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 535\". How can they raise 535 if they only had 32 total? This must be a tournament situation where they're all-in. The raise amount of 535 is probably the total bet size including their SB, but they only have 32 chips total. Actually, looking at the pot: \"Pot: 599 chips\". Blinds are 32/64. I posted BB of 64. So pot should be 32+64=96. But pot is 599. That includes the raise. So opponent raised to 535 total, which is 503 more than the SB of 32. But they only have 32 chips? This is confusing.\n\nActually, maybe the chip count display is wrong, or they have more chips than shown. Let me think: If opponent has only 32 chips, they'd be all-in with any raise. The raise to 535 would be impossible unless they have at least 535 chips. So likely the chip count \"32 chips\" is incorrect or means something else.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide: fold or call. I have Q6o, which is terrible. The pot is 599, and I need to call 471. That's pot odds of 599:471, or about 1.27:1, meaning I need about 44% equity to call. Q6o has nowhere near that against any reasonable raising range.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've shown some loose hands: Q7o, K7s, K2o, 88, etc. They raise sometimes preflop. But still, Q6o is terrible.\n\nMy stack is 272 chips (4.2 BB). If I fold, I'll have 272 chips. If I call and lose, I'm out. If I call and win, I'll have about 272 + 599 = 871 chips? Actually, my stack is 272, I need to call 471 but I only have 272 total. So I'm all-in if I call. The amount to call is 471, but I only have 272 total, so I can only call my remaining 208? Wait, I have 272 total. I already posted BB of 64, so I have 208 left. I need to call 471 more, but I only have 208, so I'm all-in for my remaining 208. The pot would be: SB 32 + my BB 64 + my all-in 208 + opponent's raise? Actually, opponent raised to 535 total, which includes their SB 32, so they put in 503 more. But they might have me covered.\n\nActually, let me calculate: I have 272 total. I put in BB of 64, leaving 208. Opponent raised to 535 total from SB. The amount to call is 471 (535 - 64). But I only have 208 left, so I can only call 208. So effectively we're both all-in if I call.\n\nPot if I call: My 272 + opponent's 535? Actually, opponent's 535 includes their SB 32, so total from opponent is 535. From me: 272 total. Pot = 272 + 535 = 807 chips.\n\nMy equity needed: risk 208 to win 599? Actually, pot before my call is 599. I need to call 208. Pot odds: 599:208 = 2.88:1, meaning I need about 26% equity. That's better.\n\nBut still, Q6o vs likely raising range has maybe 30% against a very wide range? Let's estimate: Against top 50% of hands, Q6o has about 35% equity."

Hmm.\n\nLet me calculate: If seat 2 has 32 chips total, they can only put in 32. So their raise would be an all-in for 32 total. Then the amount to call would be 0? No, I need to figure this out.\n\nBetter to check opponent tendencies first. Let me use the recall tool.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with Qc6d, which is a weak hand. My stack is 272 chips (4.2 BB). The opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 535 total, which is a massive overbet - they started with only 32 chips (the SB) and are essentially going all-in with their remaining 503 chips (since they posted 32 SB, they have 503 more to make it 535 total). Actually, wait: seat 2 had 32 chips total? No, looking at the player list: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 32 chips\". That means they only had 32 chips total, and they posted SB of 32, so they're all-in with 0 left. Actually, they raised 535, but they only have 32 chips? That doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 32 chips\". And \"preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 32\". So they posted 32 as SB, leaving them with 0 chips. Then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 535\". How can they raise 535 if they only had 32 total? This must be a tournament situation where they're all-in. The raise amount of 535 is probably the total bet size including their SB, but they only have 32 chips total. Actually, looking at the pot: \"Pot: 599 chips\". Blinds are 32/64. I posted BB of 64. So pot should be 32+64=96. But pot is 599. That includes the raise. So opponent raised to 535 total, which is 503 more than the SB of 32. But they only have 32 chips? This is confusing.\n\nActually, maybe the chip count display is wrong, or they have more chips than shown. Let me think: If opponent has only 32 chips, they'd be all-in with any raise. The raise to 535 would be impossible unless they have at least 535 chips. So likely the chip count \"32 chips\" is incorrect or means something else.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide: fold or call. I have Q6o, which is terrible. The pot is 599, and I need to call 471. That's pot odds of 599:471, or about 1.27:1, meaning I need about 44% equity to call. Q6o has nowhere near that against any reasonable raising range.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've shown some loose hands: Q7o, K7s, K2o, 88, etc. They raise sometimes preflop. But still, Q6o is terrible.\n\nMy stack is 272 chips (4.2 BB). If I fold, I'll have 272 chips. If I call and lose, I'm out. If I call and win, I'll have about 272 + 599 = 871 chips? Actually, my stack is 272, I need to call 471 but I only have 272 total. So I'm all-in if I call. The amount to call is 471, but I only have 272 total, so I can only call my remaining 208? Wait, I have 272 total. I already posted BB of 64, so I have 208 left. I need to call 471 more, but I only have 208, so I'm all-in for my remaining 208. The pot would be: SB 32 + my BB 64 + my all-in 208 + opponent's raise? Actually, opponent raised to 535 total, which includes their SB 32, so they put in 503 more. But they might have me covered.\n\nActually, let me calculate: I have 272 total. I put in BB of 64, leaving 208. Opponent raised to 535 total from SB. The amount to call is 471 (535 - 64). But I only have 208 left, so I can only call 208. So effectively we're both all-in if I call.\n\nPot if I call: My 272 + opponent's 535? Actually, opponent's 535 includes their SB 32, so total from opponent is 535. From me: 272 total. Pot = 272 + 535 = 807 chips.\n\nMy equity needed: risk 208 to win 599? Actually, pot before my call is 599. I need to call 208. Pot odds: 599:208 = 2.88:1, meaning I need about 26% equity. That's better.\n\nBut still, Q6o vs likely raising range has maybe 30% against a very wide range? Let's estimate: Against top 50% of hands, Q6o has about 35% equity.",

The pot is 26 chips currently (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 + 18 - but actually let me calculate: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, Seat 1 raised to 6 total, Seat 2 raised to 18 total. So pot is 1+2+6+18=27 chips? Wait, the system says pot is 26 chips. Maybe Seat 2's raise is to 18 total, which means additional 17? Actually Seat 2 posted SB 1, then raised to 18 total, so additional 17. Seat 1 raised to 6 total, which is additional 4 from his position. So pot = SB 1 + BB 2 + Seat 1's 6 + Seat 2's 17 = 26. Yes.\n\nI need to call 16 chips to match Seat 2's bet. My stack is 198, so calling 16 is about 8% of my stack. I have pocket kings, which is the second-best starting hand. However, there's a 3-bet from the small blind after an initial raise from UTG (Seat 1). This could indicate strong hands.\n\nI have no history on these opponents from the tools. They appear to be AI players (Kimi-K2 Thinking, Kimi-K2). Given this is a tournament, I need to consider stack preservation vs. accumulation.\n\nWith pocket kings, I should definitely not fold. I could call or raise. If I raise, minimum raise to is 30 total (additional 12 from the 18 I need to call? Wait, I need to calculate: current bet to me is 18 total. Minimum raise would be to 30 total (18 + 12). My legal actions include raise, so I can raise.\n\nGiven the strength of my hand, I should consider a 4-bet. Standard would be to raise to around 40-50 total. However, I need to consider stack sizes: I have 198, Seat 1 has 194, Seat 2 has 182. If I raise to say 45 total, that's a significant portion of stacks (about 22% of my stack). If I get 5-bet all-in, I would likely call with kings.\n\nBut there's also the possibility Seat 2 has aces. However, with kings, I should be willing to get all-in preflop. The pot is already 26, and raising could build a bigger pot.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: I need to call 16 to win 26, which is about 1.6:1 odds, requiring ~38% equity. Kings have much higher equity against most ranges. Against a range of JJ+, AK, kings have ~70% equity. Even against AA, KK, AK, kings have ~55% equity (but actually against AA only, kings have ~18% equity). But the chance of opponent having aces is low (1/221).\n\nGiven tournament considerations, I want to build a pot with my strong hand. I'll 4-bet to around 45-50 total.\n\nLet me decide: I'll raise to 45 total. That means I put in 45 chips total (I already have 2 in as BB, so additional 43).

I have KK, so only AA beats me. I should try to get value from QQ, AK, etc. Raising also protects against AA if they 5-bet shove.\n\nI should raise. Let's decide raise size. Minimum raise to 30 total (raise additional 28 from my current 2? Wait: I've already put 2 in BB. To raise to 30 total, I need to put 28 more (30 total). But minimum raise is from 18 to 30 (increase of 12). Actually the rule: minimum raise is the size of the previous raise. Previous raise was from 6 to 18 (increase of 12). So minimum raise is to 30 total (18+12). So I can raise to 30 total, putting in 28 more (since I already have 2). That's a small 4-bet. Might be okay but could invite calls. I could raise larger to 40-50 total.\n\nBut I need to consider tournament strategy: with 99 BB, I can afford to play a big pot with kings. I'll raise to 45 total (putting in 43 more). That's a reasonable 4-bet size.\n\nLet's respond with JSON.",

Shows they can play aggressively with premium hands.\n- They just called the BB this hand instead of raising, which suggests a weaker hand than KK.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Jh 9s is a marginal hand from the small blind\n- We're getting 5:1 pot odds to call 1 chip (excellent immediate odds)\n- However, we'll be out of position for the rest of the hand\n- The BB (Seat 4) still has to act after us\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- We have a healthy stack (111.5 BB)\n- Early in tournament, can afford to be selective\n- Small blind is a difficult position to play from\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Pot odds are excellent (5:1)\n2. Hand is marginal but playable multi-way\n3. We're out of position\n4. BB could still raise behind us\n5. Stack preservation vs. small investment\n\nGiven the excellent pot odds (5:1) and small investment (just 1 chip to call), it makes sense to complete the small blind. Folding would be too tight here given the price. Raising with Jh9s out of position seems ambitious. The best play is to complete and see a flop.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Excellent 5:1 pot odds to call just 1 chip with Jh9s.

Not much to go on.\n\nMy hand: I have middle pair with Jh kicker. This is a decent flop for me but vulnerable. The board is dry with no flush draws and only straight draws (6-7, 7-8, 6-7-8 type hands). \n\nPossible hands for opponents:\n- Seat 2 (UTG+1 caller): Could have a wide range including small pairs, suited connectors, broadway cards\n- Seat 4 (BB check): Could have anything since they checked their option\n\nI should consider betting here for value and protection. A bet of 4-5 chips (2/3 pot) would be reasonable. I need to charge draws and get value from worse 9x hands or overcards.\n\nHowever, I'm out of position against Seat 4 who acts after me. If I check, I might face a bet from either player.\n\nGiven my stack size (222 chips, 111 BB), I have plenty of room to maneuver. The pot is small (6 chips).\n\nI think a small bet for value and protection is good here. Let's bet 4 chips (2/3 pot).",

Suited connectors have good implied odds when they hit, but this is a low suited connector (8-high). From the button against only blinds, this could be a profitable steal opportunity.\n\nFactors to consider:\n1. Position advantage: I'm on button, will act last postflop\n2. Stack sizes: I have 228, SB has 197, BB has 198 - all similar stacks\n3. Tournament: Early stage, 114 BB deep\n4. Hand strength: Low suited connector - needs to hit flop hard to continue\n5. Steal potential: Both blinds have shown folding tendencies\n\nDecision options:\n- Fold: Conservative play with weak hand\n- Call: See flop cheaply with position\n- Raise: Attempt to steal blinds or build pot\n\nGiven the situation, I think raising is the best play. On the button with only blinds left, even a small raise has good fold equity. If called, I have position and can play postflop well. The suited connector has some playability if I hit a draw.\n\nI'll make a standard button raise to 6 chips total (4 chips more, 3x BB).

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop decision with A5s from UTG. I have 231 chips (115.5 BB). The blinds are 1/2, so I'm deep stacked. My hand is A\u26605\u2660 - suited ace with a weak kicker.\n\nFrom UTG (under the gun), this is an early position. A5s is generally considered a weak hand from UTG in tournament poker. With 5 players left to act behind me (MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB), I face significant risk of being raised or playing a multi-way pot with a dominated hand.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from the limited data: they've mostly folded or called in previous hands. No aggressive raises observed yet. However, I have no reads on how they react to UTG opens.\n\nStack sizes: I'm the chip leader with 231, others have 180-197 chips. This gives me some leverage but also means I should be careful not to bleed chips with marginal hands.\n\nTournament considerations: We're deep stacked (115BB), so I can afford to be patient. A5s has some playability postflop due to suitedness, but from UTG it's problematic. The best case is to flop a flush draw or two pair, but I'm often dominated by better aces.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 2 chips into pot of 3 (1.5:1 odds). But if I raise, I'd be putting in more chips with a weak hand.\n\nStandard play here would be to fold A5s from UTG, especially with deep stacks. I could consider a raise to 6-8BB to try to take it down preflop, but that's risky with 5 players behind who might call or re-raise.\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, the prudent play is to fold. I should wait for better spots, especially since I'm chip leader and don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern of opponents folding to raises... Looking at hand #3, everyone folded to my BTN raise with 84s. But that was from button, not UTG.\n\nDecision: Fold A5s from UTG. It's too weak for early position, especially with deep stacks.",

This is a marginal hand from early position. A5 suited is not typically a raising hand from UTG - it's usually a fold or sometimes a limp. The problem is I'm first to act after the blinds, so I'm in the worst position at the table.\n\nLet me consider tournament strategy. With 115 BB, I have a deep stack. A5 suited has some potential with flush possibilities and ace-high, but it's a weak ace. From UTG, I should be playing tight.\n\nThe players behind me: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2), Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). I don't have information about them yet, but being in early position with a weak hand suggests folding.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. That's decent, but I'm out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nGiven that I'm UTG with A5 suited, I think the correct play is to fold. This hand has reverse implied odds - if I hit an ace, I could be dominated by better aces. The suited aspect gives some flush potential, but not enough to justify playing from early position.\n\nI should wait for better spots with my deep stack. Let me fold.",

Looking at opponent data: Seat 2 has been mostly folding preflop (folded 5 out of 6 hands, called once, raised once in hand #1). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is in the big blind and hasn't shown aggressive tendencies.\n\nMy hand 5s8d is very weak - off-suit, no connectivity, low cards. In the small blind, facing a raise, this is an easy fold. The pot is 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 5 more chips (already have 1 in). That's 5 to win 9, giving me about 1.8:1 pot odds, but with such a weak hand, I'm unlikely to make a strong hand postflop.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 231 chips (115.5 BB) - a healthy stack. Seat 2 has 171 chips, Seat 4 has 244 chips. No need to take risks with marginal hands.\n\nPosition is bad - I'll be out of position postflop against the raiser.\n\nBased on opponent history: Seat 2 raised only once before (hand #1 with 18 chips raise from UTG? need to check). Actually, looking at the data: in hand #1, Seat 2 raised to 18 preflop then folded later. So they might have raised with a strong hand that time. This current raise is smaller (6 chips), but still indicates strength.\n\nEasy fold. Let's preserve chips for better spots.",

Not much history.\n\nPot odds: 6 to call into 9 pot = 1.5:1 odds = ~40% equity needed. T9o likely has less than 40% equity against a UTG raising range.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack. No need to take big risks with marginal hands.\n\nThe button position makes this tempting, but T9o is just too weak against what's likely a strong UTG raising range. Even with position, I'd be playing a dominated hand out of position against the preflop aggressor.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot. Fold.\n\nLet me check if there are any other opponents behind me. Actually, I'm on the button, so only blinds left to act after me. But still, T9o is not a good hand to call a UTG raise with.\n\nI should fold.",

I'll have to act first on every street after the flop.\n\n**3. Stack size:** I have 231 chips (115.5 BB) - a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2.\n\n**4. Opponent tendencies:**\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, BB): Has shown some aggression - raised to 6 in hand #1 and hand #8, but folded many other hands. Currently has 192 chips.\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4): Has folded most hands preflop, but showed some postflop betting in hand #5.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, SB): Has 151 chips.\n\n**5. Tournament considerations:** I have a good stack and should preserve it. Playing marginal hands from early position is generally not recommended.\n\n**6. Action:** It's my turn to act preflop. The pot is 3 chips (1 SB + 2 BB). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop.\n\n**7. Pot odds:** I'd be calling 2 to win 5 (3 already in pot + 2 from my call), which is 2.5:1 odds. However, implied odds aren't great with Q9o since it's not a strong drawing hand.\n\n**Decision:** Q9o from UTG is a clear fold in most poker strategies.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand:** 6s 6c (pocket sixes) in the BB\n**Opponent:** Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) raised to 8 from UTG\n**My stack:** 229 chips (114.5 BB)\n**Amount to call:** 6 chips\n**Pot size:** 11 chips currently\n\nFrom opponent history:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown some aggression: raised to 6 in hand #8, raised to 16 then 58 in hand #9 (3-bet), and bet 50 on flop in hand #9\n- This suggests they can have a wide raising range from UTG\n- They folded in several hands too, so not overly loose\n\nMy hand: Pocket sixes is a medium pocket pair. In the BB facing an UTG raise, this is a marginal spot. The key considerations:\n\n1. **Pot odds:** Pot is 11, need to call 6. Getting 11:6 \u2248 1.83:1 odds, need ~35% equity.\n2. **Implied odds:** If I hit a set (roughly 7.5:1 or ~12% chance), I can win a big pot against an aggressive opponent.\n3. **Position:** I'm out of position (BB vs UTG raiser), which is a disadvantage.\n4. **Stack sizes:** I have 229 chips (deep), opponent has 379 chips. Good implied odds if I hit.\n5. **Tournament considerations:** I'm in good chip position (114.5 BB), can afford to take a speculative call.\n\nThe opponent's raise size is 4x BB (8 total), which is a standard opening size. Pocket sixes has decent equity against a typical UTG raising range (maybe 22-35% depending on exact range).\n\nGiven the pot odds (35% needed) and the fact that I have good implied odds if I hit a set, calling seems reasonable. Folding is also fine since we're out of position with a medium pair. Raising seems too aggressive - we don't want to bloat the pot OOP with a medium pair.\n\nLooking at my hand history: I've been playing fairly tight (folded many hands), so a call here with a pocket pair could be a good way to see a flop and potentially win a big pot.\n\nI think calling is the best play. We get to see a flop cheaply, and if we hit a set, we can potentially stack the aggressive opponent. If we miss, we can easily fold to continuation bets.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket sixes have decent implied odds against UTG raiser.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My position: BB (Seat 3)\n- My cards: 6s 6c (bottom set on the flop!)\n- My stack: 223 chips (111.5 BB)\n- Board: 2h 6d 7c\n- Pot: 17 chips\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) with 379 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** I have bottom set (three 6s) on a 2h 6d 7c board. This is an extremely strong hand. The only real danger is a straight draw (4-5, 5-8, 8-9) or a higher set (77 or 22). But 77 is less likely given the preflop action.\n\n2. **Opponent analysis:** From the data, Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has shown aggressive tendencies:\n   - Hand #8: Preflop raise to 6\n   - Hand #9: Multiple raises preflop (16, then 58), then bet 50 on flop with KK (top set)\n   - Shows willingness to play big pots with strong hands\n   - Won Hand #9 with KK\n\n3. **Position:** I'm out of position (BB), but with a set, I want to build the pot.\n\n4. **Stack sizes:** I have 223 chips, opponent has 379. Pot is 17. I have plenty of chips to play this hand.\n\n5. **Betting considerations:** I'm first to act on the flop. With a set, I should be looking to extract value. Options:\n   - Check: Could induce a bet from opponent who raised preflop\n   - Bet: Build the pot immediately\n\n**Decision:** I have a monster hand. I should bet to build the pot. Given the pot is 17, a bet of around 10-15 chips would be reasonable. Let's bet 12 chips (about 2/3 pot) to start building the pot.\n\nI'll raise to 12 (which means putting 12 chips in total). Since amount to call is 0, this is effectively a bet of 12 chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with 6s6c. The board is 2h 6d 7c - I have bottom set! This is an extremely strong hand. The pot is 17 chips and I have 223 chips (111.5 BB). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised preflop to 8 and I called. Now on the flop, I'm first to act (since I'm BB and the preflop raiser is in Seat 1). Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 1 has raised multiple times preflop (hands 1, 8, 9). In hand 9, they showed KK and made multiple raises. They seem aggressive. They have 379 chips.\n\nWith bottom set on a 2h6d7c board, this is a monster hand. The board is relatively dry - no flush draws, straight draws are limited (only 45, 58 for gutshots, and 89 for open-ender). There's some straight potential with 45 or 58, but not many combos.\n\nI want to build the pot. Since I'm first to act, I should consider my options:\n1. Check - could induce a bet from the preflop raiser\n2. Bet/raise - build the pot with my strong hand\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive tendencies and the fact they raised preflop, they might continuation bet. However, with bottom set, I want to get value. A check-raise could work well here. But I need to think about stack sizes: I have 223, opponent has 379. The pot is 17. If I check and they bet, I can check-raise.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions: I can check or raise. If I check now, I can check-raise if they bet. That might be optimal to get more chips in. But if they check behind, I lose value. However, given their aggressive preflop raising, they're likely to continuation bet.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (111.5 BB), but this is a monster hand. I should maximize value.\n\nI'll check to induce a bet from the aggressive opponent, then raise. This is standard with sets in position against aggressive players.\n\nWait, I'm out of position actually - I'm BB, they're in Seat 1 (which appears to be UTG? Actually seats: 1, 2, 3(me), 4, 5). So I'm BB, they're UTG. I'm out of position. That makes checking even more reasonable.\n\nDecision: Check to induce a bet, then raise. But I need to make an action now. I'll check.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3d Th - This is a very weak hand. T3 offsuit is one of the worst possible starting hands. It has almost no playability post-flop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN, which is great position, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n3. **Opponent behavior**: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 8 (4x BB). Looking at their history, they've folded preflop in most recent hands (Hands 6-11 all folded preflop). In Hand #5, they raised preflop to 4 (2x BB). So this is only the second time they've raised preflop. This might indicate a stronger hand than their usual range.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 11 chips (SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 8). I need to call 7 to win 11, which gives me ~1.57:1 pot odds (about 39% equity needed). With T3o, I have nowhere near that equity against a raising range.\n\n5. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 249 chips (124.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has 143 chips (71.5 BB)\n   - MiniMax-M2 has only 47 chips (23.5 BB) in the BB - very short stack\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a good stack and should preserve it. Calling with T3o would be speculative at best and likely burning chips.\n\n7. **Additional factors**: The short stack in the BB (MiniMax-M2) might be forced to go all-in with many hands given their stack size of only 47 chips. If they shove, the pot gets bigger but I'd still have a terrible hand.\n\nGiven that:\n- My hand is extremely weak (T3o)\n- I need ~39% equity but likely have <20% against a raising range\n- Opponent has shown some aggression (raised preflop)\n- I have position but hand is too weak to leverage it\n- Better to preserve my stack for better spots\n\nThe correct play is to fold. Even though I'm on the button, T3o is simply not playable for a raise, especially when I'd be out of position relative to the raiser (they act after me post-flop).\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"T3o is too weak to call a 4x raise.

Currently has a short stack of 46 chips.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been folding frequently (8/10 times), but raised in the last hand (hand #12) to 8 chips. Currently has 152 chips.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - My stack: 249 chips (124.5 BB) - healthy\n   - SB (Seat 4): 46 chips (23 BB) - short stack\n   - BB (Seat 5): 152 chips (76 BB)\n\n5. **Situation**: Both players ahead of me have folded. I'm facing the SB (1 chip) and BB (2 chips). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop. The pot is 3 chips currently.\n\nFrom the button with A9o, this is a standard open-raise spot. The SB has a very short stack and might be forced to defend with a wide range. The BB has been folding a lot but just raised last hand, so might be getting more active.\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, I should raise to take initiative. A standard raise would be 2.5-3x the BB, so 5-6 chips total. Let me raise to 6 chips total (4 more chips on top of the 2 to call).\n\nThis puts pressure on the short-stacked SB and tests the BB who has been folding frequently. If either player calls, I have position advantage postflop with an Ace-high hand that could improve to top pair.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 6,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Standard button raise with A9o.

Now on the flop, they checked to me. I have middle pair with ace kicker, which is a decent hand on this dry board. The board is low cards with no obvious draws (no flush draws, straight draws possible with 6-8 but not likely). \n\nLooking at opponent's history: they've been folding a lot preflop (7 of 10 actions), raised once preflop in hand #5 and once in hand #12. They called my preflop raise this hand. Their stack is 148 chips (74 BB), which is smaller than my 243 chips. \n\nI should consider betting for value with top pair. The pot is 13 chips. I could check behind to see a turn card, but betting seems better to get value from worse hands like lower pairs or draws. The minimum raise is 4, but I could bet around 8-10 chips (half to 3/4 pot). \n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to fold often, they might fold to a continuation bet. But they called preflop, so they likely has some hand. I have position advantage being on the button.\n\nI think a moderate bet is good here. Let's say 9 chips (about 2/3 pot).

From UTG, this is typically a fold in most poker strategies.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (worst position at the table) - We'll have to act first on all postflop streets, which is a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Stack**: 256 chips (128 BB) - We have a deep stack, so no immediate pressure to accumulate chips.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): 367 chips - Seems aggressive based on past hands (raised in hand 8, 9, 11)\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 46 chips - Very short stack (23 BB)\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 147 chips\n\n5. **Action so far**: Only blinds posted, Seat 2 folded. We're first to act.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 128 BB, we can afford to be patient and wait for better spots. J8s from UTG is marginal at best.\n\nLooking at past hands:\n- I've folded from UTG position twice before (hand 5 and 10) with weak hands\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown aggression\n- MiniMax-M2 is very short and might be looking to push\n\nPoker strategy considerations:\n- J8s from UTG is a clear fold in most tournament strategies\n- Even if we call, we'll likely face raises from later positions\n- Suited connectors need good implied odds, but from UTG with deep stacks behind, we could get raised and have to fold\n- The pot odds are 3:2 (calling 2 to win 3), but we need much better implied odds for this hand\n\nDecision: **Fold**. This hand is too weak from UTG position. Better to wait for a stronger hand in better position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Js 8s is too weak from UTG position.

The blinds are 1/2.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, 366 chips): Has been folding a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop). Shows some aggression when they do play (raised to 8 in hand 11, bet 10 on flop).\n2. Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, 178 chips): Has folded a lot too (last 4 hands folded preflop). Showed one raise to 6 in hand 7.\n3. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, 49 chips): Short stack (24.5 BB). Has shown some aggression - raised to 4 in hand 14, and was involved in a big hand (hand 9) with multiple raises.\n4. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, 147 chips): Mostly folds preflop, raised to 8 once in hand 12, called 4 in hand 13.\n\nAs UTG with J5o, this is an easy fold. The hand has very little potential - no connectivity, no suitedness, and Jack-high is weak. From early position, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand against players who haven't acted yet. There are 4 players left to act behind me who could raise.\n\nEven though it's only 2 chips to call (1 BB), calling with J5o from UTG is terrible poker. I'd be putting money in with a hand that will rarely hit a flop well and will be difficult to play postflop out of position.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for a better spot. With 128 BB, I'm not desperate for chips. I should be playing tight from early position.\n\nGiven the tournament context, I want to avoid marginal spots with weak hands. Fold and wait for a better opportunity."

I have 256 chips (128 BB), so I have a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, 366 chips): Has been folding a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop). Shows some aggression when they do play (raised to 8 in hand 11, bet 10 on flop).\n2. Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, 178 chips): Has folded a lot too (last 4 hands folded preflop). Showed one raise to 6 in hand 7.\n3. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, 49 chips): Short stack (24.5 BB). Has shown some aggression - raised to 4 in hand 14, and was involved in a big hand (hand 9) with multiple raises.\n4. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, 147 chips): Mostly folds preflop, raised to 8 once in hand 12, called 4 in hand 13.\n\nAs UTG with J5o, this is an easy fold. The hand has very little potential - no connectivity, no suitedness, and Jack-high is weak. From early position, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand against players who haven't acted yet. There are 4 players left to act behind me who could raise.\n\nEven though it's only 2 chips to call (1 BB), calling with J5o from UTG is terrible poker. I'd be putting money in with a hand that will rarely hit a flop well and will be difficult to play postflop out of position.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for a better spot. With 128 BB, I'm not desperate for chips. I should be playing tight from early position.\n\nGiven the tournament context, I want to avoid marginal spots with weak hands. Fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

J5o is a very weak hand, especially from UTG (early position). In poker, you should play tight from early positions. With 128 BB stack, not desperate. Better to fold and wait for a better spot. Calling or raising would be bad.\n\nThus, action should be \"fold\". raise_to null. Reasoning: \"J5o is too weak from UTG.

J8o is not a good hand to play, especially from the BB.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, which is the worst position postflop. I'll have to act first on every street.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 6 total (a 3x raise from SB). Looking at their history, they've raised twice before (hand #1 and hand #7). In hand #7, they raised to 6 from SB as well. They've folded a lot (13 out of 16 actions), so they seem fairly tight.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - My stack: 254 chips (127 BB)\n   - Opponent: 172 chips (86 BB)\n   - I have a chip lead\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 8 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 5 raise). I need to call 4 to win 8, so I'm getting 2:1 pot odds (33% equity needed).\n\n6. **Hand strength**: J8o has very low equity against a typical SB raising range. Even against a wide range, it's only around 35-40% equity. Against a tighter range, it's worse.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack and don't need to take marginal spots. Playing J8o out of position against a raise is generally a losing proposition.\n\n8. **Implied odds**: The hand has some potential to make straights or two pair, but being out of position makes it hard to realize that equity. Also, J8o doesn't flop well often.\n\nGiven all this:\n- The pot odds (2:1) require about 33% equity\n- J8o likely has around 35% against a wide SB raising range\n- But opponent seems fairly tight based on their fold frequency\n- Being out of position reduces my effective equity\n- This is a marginal spot at best\n\nBetter to fold and preserve chips for better spots.

It's only playable in specific situations.\n\n**Position:** I'm in the small blind (SB). This is a terrible position to play from, especially with a weak hand.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- My stack: 253 chips (126.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2): 174 chips - raised to 6\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, BB): 47 chips - very short stack\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Kimi-K2 has raised 3 times out of 16 hands. Looking at the data:\n- Hand #1: Raised to 18 (big raise)\n- Hand #7: Raised to 6 (same as now)\n- Hand #16: Raised to 6 (same as now)\n- Mostly folds preflop (7/10 times)\n\nThis suggests Kimi-K2 is relatively tight but has shown some aggression. The 6-chip raise (3x BB) is a standard opening raise.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 5 more chips to win 9, giving me 1.8:1 pot odds (35.7% equity needed).\n\n**Hand analysis:** 72s has about 30-35% equity against a typical raising range. Against a tight range, it's even worse. Even if I hit a flush draw on the flop, I'm out of position which makes it difficult to realize equity.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have a healthy stack. The BB (MiniMax-M2) is very short (47 chips, 23.5 BB). They might feel pressured to defend their blind or go all-in.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. Terrible hand (72s)\n2. Terrible position (SB)\n3. Facing a raise from a relatively tight player\n4. Short stack in BB could squeeze\n5. Pot odds don't justify calling with such a weak hand\n6. Even if I flop a flush draw, playing it out of position will be costly\n\nThe correct play is clearly to fold. Trying to play 72s from the small blind against a raise is a recipe for losing chips. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"72s is one of the worst starting hands, especially from SB position.

Seems fairly tight/foldy.\n2. **MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB, 46 chips):** Very short stack (23 BB), has been folding most hands, raised once (hand #14 to 4 chips). Short stack may play more aggressively.\n\n**My Position Analysis:**\n- Button is the best position - I act last postflop\n- Two players left to act: SB (short stack) and BB (tight player)\n- Both blinds are relatively short-stacked compared to me\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- K9o is a marginal hand, but playable from the button against blinds\n- Good potential to steal blinds if both are weak\n- Suited would be better, but offsuit still has some value in position\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 126.5 BB, healthy stack\n- SB has only 23 BB, may be looking to shove with decent hands\n- BB has 72.5 BB, more room to maneuver\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that:\n1. I'm on the button with position advantage\n2. Both blinds have shown tendency to fold frequently\n3. K9o has decent high card value against random blinds\n4. A raise could potentially win the pot preflop\n5. Even if called, I have position advantage postflop\n\nI should raise to apply pressure and potentially win the blinds.

It has very little potential to make strong hands postflop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB (small blind), which is the worst position at the table. I'll be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n3. **Action so far**: \n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8 (2x BB)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) 3-bet to 24 (6x BB)\n\n4. **Stack sizes**:\n   - My stack: 252 chips (63 BB)\n   - Seat 2: 157 chips (39 BB) \n   - Seat 5: 139 chips (35 BB)\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is currently 36 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 8 + 3-bet 24 - my BB 4 already in). I need to call 20 to win 56 (36 + 20). That's about 2.8:1 pot odds, or ~26% equity needed.\n\n6. **Hand analysis**: 6-3o has maybe 20-25% equity against a typical 3-betting range. But we're in terrible position with a hand that plays poorly postflop. Even if we hit a pair, we're often dominated.\n\n7. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has mostly folded preflop, but raised twice in recent hands (hands 16 and 17). This 3-bet is aggressive.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has mostly folded preflop, but called once and bet once postflop.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (63 BB). No need to gamble with trash hands. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n9. **Additional factors**: Seat 5 still has to act after me. If I call, they might 4-bet or call, creating a multiway pot with a terrible hand out of position.\n\nThe math doesn't justify calling. Even with decent pot odds, 6-3o is just too weak. We'll be playing a big pot out of position with a hand that rarely improves to anything strong. Folding is clearly correct.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"6-3o is one of the worst starting hands.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this hand. We're in the BB with pocket 7s. The board is 9d Jh 2s. We're heads-up against Kimi-K2 who raised preflop to 12 (3x BB). We called from the BB.\n\nNow on the flop, we have first action (since Kimi-K2 was the preflop aggressor and we're in position relative to them on this street? Wait, actually Kimi-K2 is in Seat 2, we're in Seat 3 (BB). So Kimi-K2 is to our right, meaning they act before us. But the prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\" and we have legal actions fold, check, raise. That means it's our turn to act and there's no bet to call, so Kimi-K2 must have checked. So Kimi-K2 checked the flop to us.\n\nWe have middle pair with 7s on a 9d Jh 2s board. This is a decent flop for our hand - we have middle pair, no overcards to our 7s except the 9 and J. The board is relatively dry with no flush draws (two hearts but we have one heart). There's a possible straight draw with T8 or QTs type hands, but not many.\n\nKimi-K2's preflop raise history shows they've been folding a lot (7 out of 10 hands), but raised 3 times: hand 16 (raise 6), hand 17 (raise 6), and hand 21 (raise 24). So they seem to be raising with a wide range when they do play, but mostly folding. The raise to 24 in hand 21 was quite large (6x BB).\n\nOur stack is 240 chips (60 BB), Kimi-K2 has 181 chips. The pot is 28 chips.\n\nSince Kimi-K2 checked to us, we have options. We could check back to see a turn card cheaply, or we could bet for value/protection. With middle pair on a dry board, betting could get value from worse pairs (like 55, 66, maybe 88 if they have it) or Ace-high hands. But we need to consider Kimi-K2's likely range.\n\nGiven Kimi-K2's preflop raise, they could have a wide range: any pair, suited connectors, broadway cards. On this 9d Jh 2s board, many of their hands missed. They might have AJ, KJ, QJ, JT, T9, 99, JJ, 22, or overcards like AQ, AK, KQ.\n\nIf we bet and get raised, we're in a tough spot. But if we bet small (maybe 12-15 chips, about half pot), we can get value from worse hands and potentially fold out some overcards.\n\nAlternatively, checking back is safe and keeps the pot small. We have position for the rest of the hand, which is good.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations. We have 60 BB, which is healthy. Kimi-K2 has about 45 BB. We don't want to get stacked with middle pair, but we also want to accumulate chips.\n\nI think a small bet is reasonable here. If Kimi-K2 calls, we can reevaluate on the turn. If they raise, we can likely fold unless we think they're bluffing.\n\nActually, wait - let me check if Kimi-K2 has shown any postflop aggression. Let me search for their postflop actions.",

The pot is 28 chips and it's checked to me on the flop. I have 240 chips (60 BB). My opponent has 181 chips.\n\nWith pocket 7s on a 9d Jh 2s flop, this is a decent flop for my hand. There's no obvious flush draws (two hearts on board but I don't have hearts), and the board is relatively dry. The 9 is higher than my 7s, but there's no overcards to my pair except the J.\n\nI should consider my opponent's range. They raised preflop from UTG+1 position (Seat 2). Their range likely includes strong hands: JJ+, AJ+, maybe KQ, suited connectors, etc. The flop has a J and 9, which could hit their range.\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: only 1 flop action recorded - a fold. Not much to go on.\n\nPot odds: If I check, I give a free card. If I bet, I can get value from worse pairs (like 88, 66, 55, etc.) or try to get folds from overcards. A bet of around 15-20 chips (half pot) would be reasonable.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 60 BB, which is healthy. My opponent has 45 BB. I don't want to get too involved with a marginal hand, but pocket 7s on this board is decent.\n\nI should probably make a continuation bet here. If I get raised, I can consider folding. If called, I can reevaluate on turn.\n\nLet me check if there are any other relevant observations.",

If I bet/raise, I could take it down now. But raising risks getting raised back, and I'm out of position.\n\nLet me think about opponent tendencies. From the recall, only 1 flop action found: he folded on flop in hand #2. Not much data. But preflop he raised, showing aggression.\n\nPot odds: if I check and he bets, I'll need to decide. But now I can check and see what he does. Or I can bet for protection/value with my middle pair.\n\nGiven I'm out of position and have a marginal hand, checking seems reasonable to control pot size and see what opponent does. If he checks back, I get a free turn card. If he bets, I can evaluate then.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 60 BB, healthy stack.

          "content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\nWe're on the turn with pocket 7s. Board: 9d Jh 2s 8h. We're in the BB with 240 chips (60 BB). Opponent Kimi-K2 has 181 chips. The pot is 28 chips. We checked on the flop, opponent checked back. Now it's our turn to act on the turn with amount to call = 0.\n\nOur hand: Pocket 7s. We have a pair of 7s, which is a medium pair. The board has 9d, Jh, 2s, 8h. Our pair is likely not good if opponent has any piece of this board. However, there's a straight draw possibility: we have an open-ended straight draw with 7-7-9-J-8, needing a T for a straight (we have 7, board has 8,9,J, so T gives us 7-8-9-T-J). Also, we have backdoor flush potential with the 7h giving us a heart.\n\nOpponent Kimi-K2 raised preflop to 12 (3x BB) from UTG+1 position. Based on the opponent history I saw, they've been folding a lot preflop (hands 12-15, 18-20), but raised in hands 16, 17, and 21. So they seem to raise with premium hands. Their check on the flop suggests they might not have connected strongly or are playing cautiously.\n\nGiven the pot is only 28 chips and we have position (we act first on this street), we have several options:\n\n1. Check: See a free river card. This is reasonable since we have a draw to a straight and our pair might be good if opponent missed.\n2. Bet: Try to take down the pot now with a semi-bluff, representing a hand like a 9, J, or straight draw.\n\nOur stack is 240 vs opponent's 181. We have a decent stack. If we bet and get called, we'll have to decide on river.\n\nConsidering opponent's tendencies: They've raised preflop but checked flop. They might have a medium pocket pair (TT, QQ?), AK/AQ that missed, or maybe a hand like AT, KT. Their check suggests weakness.\n\nI think a small bet could be good here. We can represent a hand that connected with the board. If we bet 12-16 chips (about half pot), we can get folds from hands that missed. If called, we still have outs on river.\n\nActually, let me think about pot odds and implied odds. If we bet 14 chips into 28, we're risking 14 to win 28 (2:1). If we get called, pot becomes 56, and we'd have to decide on river.\n\nBut actually, we're first to act on turn. We could check and see what opponent does. If they bet, we'd have to decide whether to call based on pot odds. Checking seems safer.\n\nHowever, with our straight draw and pair, we have some equity. Let's estimate: We have 8 outs to a straight (four Ts), maybe 2 outs to improve our pair (two remaining 7s). That's 10 outs, about 20% equity to improve by river. But our pair might already be best.\n\nGiven opponent checked flop after raising preflop, they likely have a hand like AK, AQ, KQ, or medium pocket pair that didn't improve. They might fold to a bet.\n\nI think a small bet is good here. Let's say bet 12 chips (less than half pot). This puts pressure on opponent while not risking too much.\n\nWait, but we need to consider tournament implications. We have 60 BB, which is healthy. No need to take big risks. But also, we want to accumulate chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The board is somewhat coordinated with straight draws possible (T would complete a straight for any hand with a 7 or Q). Our 7s are vulnerable. If opponent has a hand like AT, KT, QT, they have a pair plus straight draw. If they have a pair like 99, JJ, they have us crushed.\n\nGiven the information, I think checking is reasonable to realize our equity cheaply. If we check and opponent bets, we can evaluate then.\n\nBut actually, we have position (we act first this street, but opponent acts last overall). Hmm, we're in BB, opponent is UTG+1. On turn, we act first. So if we check, opponent can bet.\n\nI think checking is fine. We get to see a river card for free, and if opponent bets, we can decide based on bet size.\n\nLet's check."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\nWe're on the turn with pocket 7s. Board: 9d Jh 2s 8h. We're in the BB with 240 chips (60 BB). Opponent Kimi-K2 has 181 chips. The pot is 28 chips. We checked on the flop, opponent checked back. Now it's our turn to act on the turn with amount to call = 0.\n\nOur hand: Pocket 7s. We have a pair of 7s, which is a medium pair. The board has 9d, Jh, 2s, 8h. Our pair is likely not good if opponent has any piece of this board. However, there's a straight draw possibility: we have an open-ended straight draw with 7-7-9-J-8, needing a T for a straight (we have 7, board has 8,9,J, so T gives us 7-8-9-T-J). Also, we have backdoor flush potential with the 7h giving us a heart.\n\nOpponent Kimi-K2 raised preflop to 12 (3x BB) from UTG+1 position. Based on the opponent history I saw, they've been folding a lot preflop (hands 12-15, 18-20), but raised in hands 16, 17, and 21. So they seem to raise with premium hands. Their check on the flop suggests they might not have connected strongly or are playing cautiously.\n\nGiven the pot is only 28 chips and we have position (we act first on this street), we have several options:\n\n1. Check: See a free river card. This is reasonable since we have a draw to a straight and our pair might be good if opponent missed.\n2. Bet: Try to take down the pot now with a semi-bluff, representing a hand like a 9, J, or straight draw.\n\nOur stack is 240 vs opponent's 181. We have a decent stack. If we bet and get called, we'll have to decide on river.\n\nConsidering opponent's tendencies: They've raised preflop but checked flop. They might have a medium pocket pair (TT, QQ?), AK/AQ that missed, or maybe a hand like AT, KT. Their check suggests weakness.\n\nI think a small bet could be good here. We can represent a hand that connected with the board. If we bet 12-16 chips (about half pot), we can get folds from hands that missed. If called, we still have outs on river.\n\nActually, let me think about pot odds and implied odds. If we bet 14 chips into 28, we're risking 14 to win 28 (2:1). If we get called, pot becomes 56, and we'd have to decide on river.\n\nBut actually, we're first to act on turn. We could check and see what opponent does. If they bet, we'd have to decide whether to call based on pot odds. Checking seems safer.\n\nHowever, with our straight draw and pair, we have some equity. Let's estimate: We have 8 outs to a straight (four Ts), maybe 2 outs to improve our pair (two remaining 7s). That's 10 outs, about 20% equity to improve by river. But our pair might already be best.\n\nGiven opponent checked flop after raising preflop, they likely have a hand like AK, AQ, KQ, or medium pocket pair that didn't improve. They might fold to a bet.\n\nI think a small bet is good here. Let's say bet 12 chips (less than half pot). This puts pressure on opponent while not risking too much.\n\nWait, but we need to consider tournament implications. We have 60 BB, which is healthy. No need to take big risks. But also, we want to accumulate chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The board is somewhat coordinated with straight draws possible (T would complete a straight for any hand with a 7 or Q). Our 7s are vulnerable. If opponent has a hand like AT, KT, QT, they have a pair plus straight draw. If they have a pair like 99, JJ, they have us crushed.\n\nGiven the information, I think checking is reasonable to realize our equity cheaply.

We don't need to take big risks. Checking seems reasonable to realize our equity.\n\nActually, let me think about bet sizing. Minimum raise is to 8 total (4 more). That's very small relative to pot (28). If we bet minimum, it looks weak. Better to bet more like 12-16 if we're going to bet.\n\nBut given our hand strength (pair of 7s might not be good, but we have draw), and tournament considerations, I think checking is fine.\n\nI'll go with check.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the BB with pocket 7s. The board is 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd. The river just came Jd, making the board: 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd. There are two jacks on board, so my pocket 7s are basically a bluff catcher at this point - I have a pair of 7s, but the board has two jacks, so any jack beats me, as do any pairs higher than 7s.\n\nThe pot is 28 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop to 12, I called from BB. On flop and turn, both checked. Now on river, it's my action first. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nLooking at opponent's tendencies: Seat 2 has shown some aggression - raised 3 times out of 10 observed actions (hands 16, 17, 21). But they've also folded a lot (7 times). They raised preflop this hand to 12 (3x BB). After raising, they checked both flop and turn. This suggests they might have missed the flop or have a medium-strength hand.\n\nThe board is 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd. The river brought a second jack. This is a scary card for many hands. If opponent had a jack, they likely would have bet on the flop or turn with top pair. But they checked both streets. If they have a jack now, it's unlikely they just got there on the river unless they had Jx.\n\nMy hand: pocket 7s. This is essentially a bluff catcher. I beat bluffs and worse pocket pairs (22, 33, 44, 55, 66). I lose to any jack, any pair 88+, any straight (T7 or 7T for straight? Actually board is 9-8-2-J-J, so straight would need T7 or 7T, but that's unlikely). \n\nGiven opponent checked twice, they likely don't have a strong hand. They might have missed with AK/AQ type hands, or have a medium pocket pair like TT, 99, 88 (though 99 and 88 would have likely bet for value). TT might be scared of the jack.\n\nIf I check, I likely see a showdown. If I bet, I could get called by worse hands (smaller pocket pairs) or fold out better hands (if they're scared of the jack). But betting here with a weak hand on a paired board is risky - I could get raised, and I'd have to fold.\n\nPot is small (28 chips). My stack is 240 chips (60 BB). Opponent has 181 chips. Tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack relative to blinds.\n\nGiven the paired board and my weak hand, checking seems best. I can win if opponent has nothing, or lose minimally if they have something. Betting risks 8+ chips into 28, and I might get raised or called by better.\n\nI'll check and see what happens.",

When they do raise, they raise to 6 chips in earlier hands (when blinds were smaller) and 24 chips in hand #21. In this hand #22, they raised to 12 preflop (3x BB).\n\nThey checked both flop and turn, then bet 16 on river. The river brought a second J, making the board 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd.\n\n**Hand History:**\n- Preflop: Opponent raised to 12, I called from BB with 77\n- Flop: 9d Jh 2s - I checked, opponent checked\n- Turn: 8h - I checked, opponent checked  \n- River: Jd - I checked, opponent bet 16\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe board is 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd. This gives me:\n- Pair of 7s (weak pair on this board)\n- Possible straight draws that got there: T7 (for 7-high straight 7-8-9-T-J), but I have 77 so no\n- Opponent could have:\n  * A J (trips or full house)\n  * A 9 or 8 (two pair with J)\n  * A missed straight draw (T7, T6, 76, etc.)\n  * A bluff with air\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot before bet: 44 chips\n- Bet: 16 chips\n- Total pot if I call: 60 chips\n- Pot odds: 16/60 = 26.7%\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nI have a pair of 7s. On this board with J-J-9-8-2:\n- I beat: bluffs, lower pairs (55, 66, etc.)\n- I lose to: any J, any 9, any 8, any pocket pair higher than 7s, any two pair, any straight\n- The paired Js reduce combos of Jx hands somewhat, but still many possible\n\n**Opponent Betting Pattern:**\nOpponent raised preflop, checked flop and turn, then bet river. This could be:\n1. Value bet with a J (slow-playing trips)\n2. Value bet with a 9 or 8 (two pair)\n3. Bluff with missed draw (T7, 76, etc.)\n4. Bluff with air trying to take it down\n\nGiven opponent's tight preflop tendencies (mostly folding), their raising range is likely stronger. They raised to 12 preflop (3x), which is a standard raise size.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 240 chips (60 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent has 165 chips (41 BB)\n- Pot is 44 chips (11 BB)\n- Call costs 16 chips (4 BB)\n\n**Decision:**\nI'm getting 26.7% pot odds. My hand likely needs to be good ~27% of the time to call. With a pair of 7s on this board, I'm probably only beating bluffs and maybe some very small pocket pairs that didn't improve. The opponent's checking on flop and turn then betting river looks like they either improved on river (got a J) or are betting for thin value with a medium hand.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight preflop tendencies and the fact they raised, then checked two streets, then bet river, this feels more like a value bet than a bluff. The river J pairs the board, which could make them think their J is now full house or they can value bet trips.\n\nI think this is a fold. The pot odds aren't great and my hand is weak on this board. Better to preserve my stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pair of 7s is weak on J-J-9-8-2 board.

When they do raise, they raise to 6 chips in earlier hands (when blinds were smaller) and 24 chips in hand #21. In this hand #22, they raised to 12 preflop (3x BB).\n\nThey checked both flop and turn, then bet 16 on river. The river brought a second J, making the board 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd.\n\n**Hand History:**\n- Preflop: Opponent raised to 12, I called from BB with 77\n- Flop: 9d Jh 2s - I checked, opponent checked\n- Turn: 8h - I checked, opponent checked  \n- River: Jd - I checked, opponent bet 16\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe board is 9d Jh 2s 8h Jd. This gives me:\n- Pair of 7s (weak pair on this board)\n- Possible straight draws that got there: T7 (for 7-high straight 7-8-9-T-J), but I have 77 so no\n- Opponent could have:\n  * A J (trips or full house)\n  * A 9 or 8 (two pair with J)\n  * A missed straight draw (T7, T6, 76, etc.)\n  * A bluff with air\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot before bet: 44 chips\n- Bet: 16 chips\n- Total pot if I call: 60 chips\n- Pot odds: 16/60 = 26.7%\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nI have a pair of 7s. On this board with J-J-9-8-2:\n- I beat: bluffs, lower pairs (55, 66, etc.)\n- I lose to: any J, any 9, any 8, any pocket pair higher than 7s, any two pair, any straight\n- The paired Js reduce combos of Jx hands somewhat, but still many possible\n\n**Opponent Betting Pattern:**\nOpponent raised preflop, checked flop and turn, then bet river. This could be:\n1. Value bet with a J (slow-playing trips)\n2. Value bet with a 9 or 8 (two pair)\n3. Bluff with missed draw (T7, 76, etc.)\n4. Bluff with air trying to take it down\n\nGiven opponent's tight preflop tendencies (mostly folding), their raising range is likely stronger. They raised to 12 preflop (3x), which is a standard raise size.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 240 chips (60 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent has 165 chips (41 BB)\n- Pot is 44 chips (11 BB)\n- Call costs 16 chips (4 BB)\n\n**Decision:**\nI'm getting 26.7% pot odds. My hand likely needs to be good ~27% of the time to call. With a pair of 7s on this board, I'm probably only beating bluffs and maybe some very small pocket pairs that didn't improve.

The river J pairs the board, which could make them think their J is now full house or they can value bet trips.\n\nI think this is a fold. The pot odds aren't great and my hand is weak on this board.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Qc 9c - suited connectors, moderate speculative hand. Playable in position but not strong.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN) - excellent position, which gives me advantage postflop.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 240 chips (60 BB)\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking: 357 chips (raiser from UTG)\n   - MiniMax-M2: 40 chips (short stack, in SB)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B: 135 chips (in BB)\n\n4. **Action**: Kimi-K2 Thinking raised to 12 from UTG (3x BB). This is a standard raise. Looking at opponent history:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised twice before (hands 15 and 20, both 6 chips). This 12 chip raise is larger.\n   - MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot (9 of last 10 hands)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been mostly folding but raised once in hand 21\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 12). I need to call 12 to win 30 (18+12). That's 2.5:1 pot odds, or 29% equity needed.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy 60 BB stack. Q9s is a speculative hand that plays well in position but is dominated by UTG raising ranges. UTG raises typically represent strong hands (top 15-20% of hands).\n\n7. **Additional factors**: There are two players left to act (SB and BB). SB is very short-stacked (10 BB) and may shove. BB might also call or raise.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Q9s has decent implied odds if I hit a flush or straight, but I'm out of position relative to the raiser.\n- UTG raises are typically strong, so I'm likely behind.\n- With 60 BB, I can afford to fold speculative hands.\n- The pot odds (29% equity needed) are borderline - Q9s vs a typical UTG range has about 30-35% equity, but that's close.\n\nHowever, my position on the button is excellent. If I call, I'll have position on everyone postflop. But the short stack in SB could shove, changing dynamics.\n\nGiven tournament preservation and that this is a marginal spot with a hand that can get me into trouble, I think folding is prudent. Better to wait for stronger spots in position.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm UTG with 6c4c, which is a weak hand - suited connectors but low cards. My stack is 240 chips (60 BB). The blinds are 2/4. Seat 5 (SB) posted 2, Seat 1 (BB) posted 4, and Seat 2 folded. So it's my action with 4 to call.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking, BB, 371 chips): Has raised preflop in 4 of 10 hands, including a raise to 12 last hand. Seems aggressive when they play.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2, 40 chips): Has folded 9 of last 10 hands, only raised once in hand 14. Very tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B, SB, 133 chips): Has folded 7 of 10 hands, called once, raised once, bet once on flop. Somewhat tight but capable of aggression.\n\nMy position is UTG - worst position at the table. With 6c4c, this is a clear fold from UTG. Suited connectors play better in later positions with more players to potentially call. From UTG, I'd be opening with this weak hand into 4 players left to act, including an aggressive BB.\n\nMy stack is healthy at 60 BB, no need to gamble with marginal hands from early position. Better to wait for stronger spots.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 4 into pot of 6, so getting 1.5:1 odds, but implied odds with suited connectors could be decent if I hit a flush or straight. However, position is terrible and I'll be out of position post-flop against potentially multiple opponents.\n\nTournament considerations: Preserving stack is important. No need to play marginal hands from early position.\n\nDecision: Fold. This is standard poker - fold weak suited connectors from UTG.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**My hand:** 7d 2h - This is an extremely weak hand, one of the worst possible starting hands in poker.\n\n**Position:** SB (small blind). I've already posted 2 chips, need to call 2 more to see the flop.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- Me: 240 chips (60 BB)\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): 195 chips - just called\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 60 chips (15 BB) - will be in BB\n\n**Pot:** Currently 10 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 4 call)\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): From recent hands, seems to play some hands. Called 4 in hand 25, raised to 12 in hand 22. Not overly aggressive.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has been folding a lot but raised twice in recent hands (hands 24 and 25). Has a very short stack of 60 chips (15 BB).\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 60 BB, which is a healthy stack. Seat 4 is very short (15 BB) and could be looking to shove or play aggressively.\n\n**Hand analysis:** 7d 2h is trash. Even with the small price of 2 chips (completing the SB), this hand has almost no potential. It's offsuit, low cards, no straight potential. The only reason to play would be if I thought I could outplay opponents postflop, but with such a weak hand, I'll be dominated most of the time.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 12 chips (after my call). That's 6:1 pot odds, which is good mathematically. However, implied odds are poor because:\n1. I'm out of position (SB)\n2. My hand is terrible\n3. I'll likely face aggression from the BB who has a short stack\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. Even though it's only 2 chips, playing 7-2 offsuit from the small blind is a recipe for losing more chips postflop. With a healthy stack of 60 BB, I should preserve it for better spots.\n\n**Alternative considerations:** If I had a stronger hand or better position, calling might be okay. But with this trash hand, fold is correct.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns with Seat 4's short stack play.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the small blind with 7d 2h, which is an extremely weak hand. My stack is 240 chips (60 BB). The big blind is MiniMax-M2 with only 60 chips (15 BB) - they're short stacked. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has called the big blind of 4. I need to call 2 more to complete the small blind.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 (BB) has been active - they raised preflop in hands 24 and 25. They're short stacked and likely to play aggressively. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) just called, which could indicate a medium-strength hand.\n\nWith 7d 2h, this is one of the worst possible hands. Even with just 2 chips to call, the hand is so weak that it's not worth playing, especially with a short-stacked BB who might squeeze. The pot is only 10 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 4 call).\n\nGiven my position (SB), I'll have to act first on every post-flop street, which is a huge disadvantage. The hand has virtually no potential - even if I hit a pair, it's bottom pair with weak kicker.\n\nBetter to fold and preserve my stack. In tournament poker, playing weak hands from the small blind can lead to difficult spots and chip loss. Even though it's only 2 chips, those chips matter in tournament play.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors. The BB is short stacked, so they might go all-in preflop, which would put pressure on me. My hand is not worth defending.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Td 9s on a 5c 6s 8h flop. This is a fantastic flop for me - I have an open-ended straight draw (7 or J gives me a straight). I also have two overcards (Ten and Nine) which could be good if opponent has middle pair. No flush draws on board.\n\n2. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 with 40 chips total (10 BB). They posted SB (2), called my raise preflop (10 more), and now bet 8 on flop. They have only 20 chips left after this bet (40 - 2 - 10 - 8 = 20). This is a very short stack.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is excellent.\n\n4. **Pot size**: 36 chips before flop bet, now 44 after opponent's 8-chip bet. I need to call 8 to win 44, giving me 5.5:1 pot odds.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, MiniMax-M2 has:\n   - Folded preflop 4 times\n   - Raised preflop twice (hand 24 and 25)\n   - Bet flop once before (hand 25, bet 4 on flop)\n   - Checked flop once (hand 27)\n   - Folded to action once on flop\n\nIn hand 25, they raised preflop (8), then bet 4 on flop. That suggests they might be aggressive with decent hands. However, their stack is now critically short - they have only 20 chips left after this bet.\n\n6. **My hand potential**: With open-ended straight draw, I have 8 outs (four 7s and four Js). That's about 32% chance to hit by river, or ~17% on turn. With 5.5:1 pot odds, I need only ~15% equity to call, so mathematically a call is fine.\n\n7. **Stack sizes**: Opponent has 20 left after this bet. If I call (8), pot becomes 52, and opponent has 20 left. This sets up potential for me to win their remaining chips if I hit my straight. Implied odds are good.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: I have 228 chips (57 BB), which is healthy. Opponent is very short. I should be looking to accumulate chips from short stacks.\n\nGiven opponent's short stack and my strong draw, I should probably raise to put maximum pressure. A raise could get them to fold if they're weak, or commit them if they call. But let me think: if I raise to 16 (minimum), that's 8 more than calling. Pot would be 60, and opponent would have to call 8 more with 20 left. They'd likely call with any decent hand given pot odds.\n\nActually, with their stack so short, they might be desperate and willing to go all-in with many hands. My straight draw is good against most hands they'd have.\n\nI think the best play is to raise. Let me check if I should raise more than minimum. If I raise to say 24 (putting in 24 total, which is 16 more), that would leave opponent with only 12 to call into a pot of 68, giving them huge pot odds. They'd likely call anyway.\n\nActually, given they only have 20 left, any raise essentially commits them. I could just call and see turn, hoping to hit my straight. But raising has benefits: might get them to fold now, or build pot for when I hit.\n\nWait, if they have only 20 left, and I raise to say 20 (putting in 20 total, 12 more), they'd have to call 12 into pot of 64 (36+8+20). That's 5.3:1 odds - they'd call with almost anything.\n\nActually, I should consider going all-in? I have 228, opponent has 20 left. If I go all-in, they'd have to call 12 more (20-8 they already bet). That's an overbet, but might get them to fold if they're weak.\n\nBut actually, with their stack so short, they might call with any pair. My draw is good against pairs.\n\nLet me think about what hands they could have:\n- They called my preflop raise from SB. Could have many hands: small pairs, suited connectors, Ax, Kx, etc.\n- Flop is 5c 6s 8h. They bet 8 into 36. This could be:\n  * A pair (maybe 7x, 9x, Tx, etc.)\n  * A draw (like 7x for open-ended, or flush draw - but no flush possible"

I need to call 8 to win 44, giving me 5.5:1 pot odds.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, MiniMax-M2 has:\n   - Folded preflop 4 times\n   - Raised preflop twice (hand 24 and 25)\n   - Bet flop once before (hand 25, bet 4 on flop)\n   - Checked flop once (hand 27)\n   - Folded to action once on flop\n\nIn hand 25, they raised preflop (8), then bet 4 on flop. That suggests they might be aggressive with decent hands. However, their stack is now critically short - they have only 20 chips left after this bet.\n\n6. **My hand potential**: With open-ended straight draw, I have 8 outs (four 7s and four Js). That's about 32% chance to hit by river, or ~17% on turn. With 5.5:1 pot odds, I need only ~15% equity to call, so mathematically a call is fine.\n\n7. **Stack sizes**: Opponent has 20 left after this bet. If I call (8), pot becomes 52, and opponent has 20 left. This sets up potential for me to win their remaining chips if I hit my straight. Implied odds are good.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: I have 228 chips (57 BB), which is healthy. Opponent is very short. I should be looking to accumulate chips from short stacks.\n\nGiven opponent's short stack and my strong draw, I should probably raise to put maximum pressure. A raise could get them to fold if they're weak, or commit them if they call. But let me think: if I raise to 16 (minimum), that's 8 more than calling. Pot would be 60, and opponent would have to call 8 more with 20 left. They'd likely call with any decent hand given pot odds.\n\nActually, with their stack so short, they might be desperate and willing to go all-in with many hands. My straight draw is good against most hands they'd have.\n\nI think the best play is to raise. Let me check if I should raise more than minimum. If I raise to say 24 (putting in 24 total, which is 16 more), that would leave opponent with only 12 to call into a pot of 68, giving them huge pot odds. They'd likely call anyway.\n\nActually, given they only have 20 left, any raise essentially commits them. I could just call and see turn, hoping to hit my straight. But raising has benefits: might get them to fold now, or build pot for when I hit.\n\nWait, if they have only 20 left, and I raise to say 20 (putting in 20 total, 12 more), they'd have to call 12 into pot of 64 (36+8+20). That's 5.3:1 odds - they'd call with almost anything.\n\nActually, I should consider going all-in? I have 228, opponent has 20 left. If I go all-in, they'd have to call 12 more (20-8 they already bet). That's an overbet, but might get them to fold if they're weak.\n\nBut actually, with their stack so short, they might call with any pair. My draw is good against pairs.\n\nLet me think about what hands they could have:\n- They called my preflop raise from SB. Could have many hands: small pairs, suited connectors, Ax, Kx, etc.\n- Flop is 5c 6s 8h. They bet 8 into 36. This could be:\n  * A pair (maybe 7x, 9x, Tx, etc.)\n  * A draw (like 7x for open-ended, or flush draw - but no flush possible",

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm on the button with Td 9s. The board is 5c 6s 8h 8d. I have a straight draw (7 gives me a straight with 5-6-7-8-9, and T-9 gives me a pair of tens or nines). Actually, I have an open-ended straight draw: I need a 7 to complete a 5-6-7-8-9 straight. Also, any T or 9 gives me a pair. \n\nThe pot is 60 chips. My opponent MiniMax-M2 has only 32 chips total (he's very short stacked). He checked to me on the turn. He bet 8 on the flop and called my raise of 16 (so he put in 8 more). \n\nLooking at opponent history: MiniMax-M2 has been playing fairly tight - folded preflop in hands 21-23, raised in hands 24-25, then folded in 26, checked in 27. In hand 25, he raised preflop then bet 4 on flop. He seems to be playing aggressively when he has hands.\n\nMy hand is decent with the straight draw and potential pair. The board has paired 8s, which reduces the likelihood he has an 8. My raise on the flop represented strength. He called, which suggests he has something - maybe a pair, a draw, or a weak hand he's floating with.\n\nGiven his short stack (32 chips total), he's likely to call any bet with any decent hand. I have position and a draw. I should probably bet for value and to put pressure on him. A small bet might get him to fold weak hands, but he might call with any piece. \n\nPot is 60, he has 32 total. If I bet 16 (half pot), he'd have to call 16 into 76 pot, getting about 4.75:1 odds. That's good odds for him if he has any draw or pair. But he only has 16 chips left after calling (32-16=16). \n\nActually, let me calculate: He started with 32 chips. He put in 2 SB preflop, called 10 more preflop (total 12), bet 8 on flop, called 8 more on flop (total 28). So he has 4 chips left! Wait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate:\n\nStarting stack: 32 chips\nPreflop: SB 2 + call 10 = 12 invested, 20 left\nFlop: bet 8 (12 left) + call 8 (4 left)\nSo he has 4 chips remaining!\n\nThat's important. He has only 4 chips left. So any bet I make, he's basically pot-committed. He'll likely call with almost anything.\n\nGiven this, I should probably bet his remaining 4 chips to get maximum value. If I check, I give him a free river card. But if I bet, he'll likely call with any piece. My hand has decent equity: I have 8 outs to a straight (four 7s), plus 6 outs to a pair (three Ts, three 9s, though one 9 might be counterfeited if he has a better pair). Actually, I should discount the pair outs somewhat. \n\nBetter to bet small to get value from worse hands. But he only has 4 chips, so I should bet 4 to put him all-in. That's the minimum raise amount is 8, but I can bet 4 as a \"bet\" not a raise? Wait, the legal actions are fold, check, raise. The amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise. Minimum raise to: 8. That means if I want to bet, I have to raise to at least 8 total? Actually, \"raise_to\" is the total amount I'm putting in. Currently I have 0 in this street. So raising to 8 means putting in 8 chips. That's more than his remaining 4.\n\nBut actually, I think I can just bet 4. Let me check: \"Legal actions: fold, check, raise\" - no \"bet\" option. But since amount to call is 0, I can check or raise. To bet, I would need to raise to some amount. The minimum raise to is 8, meaning I need to put in at least 8 chips. That's fine - he only has 4 left, so he can only call 4. So if I raise to 8, he can call 4 more and be all-in.\n\nActually, wait: He has 4 chips. If I raise to 8 (putting in 8 chips), he would need to call 8 to match? No,"

Also potential pair with T or 9. Opponent MiniMax-M2 has only 4 chips left (from 32 total). He checked to me on the turn.\n\nHe bet 8 on flop (into ~28 pot? Let me calculate: Preflop pot was: SB 2 + BB 4 + my raise 12 + his call 10 = 28 chips. Then on flop he bet 8, I raised to 16 total (so additional 8), he called 8 more. So pot after flop: 28 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 52? Wait, that doesn't match pot size of 60. Let me recalculate properly:\n\nPreflop:\n- SB (MiniMax-M2): 2\n- BB (GPT-OSS-120B): 4  \n- My raise: 12 (total)\n- MiniMax-M2 call: 10 more (he already put 2, so total 12)\n- BB fold\n\nSo preflop pot: 2 + 4 + 12 = 18? No, that's not right. Actually: SB 2, BB 4, my raise 12 (total), MiniMax calls 10 more. So total in pot: 2 (SB) + 4 (BB) + 12 (me) + 10 (MiniMax) = 28 chips.\n\nFlop:\nMiniMax bets 8 (pot now 36)\nI raise to 16 total (so I put in 8 more? Actually I need to put in 16 total this street, but I haven't put anything yet. So I put in 16, making pot: 28 + 8 + 16 = 52)\nMiniMax calls 8 more (he already bet 8, needs to call 8 more to match my 16, so he puts in 8 more, pot: 52 + 8 = 60)\n\nYes, pot is 60. He has 4 chips left.\n\nNow turn: He checks. I have option to check or raise. Minimum raise to: 8. That means if I want to bet, I need to put in at least 8 chips. He only has 4 chips, so he can only call 4. The pot would then be 60 + 8 + 4 = 72.\n\nMy hand: Td 9s. I have 8 clean outs to a straight (four 7s). I also have 6 outs to a pair (three Ts, three 9s), but some of these might not be clean if he has a better pair. The board has paired 8s, so if he has an 8, I'm drawing dead to a straight. But he likely doesn't have an 8 given his flop bet/call line.\n\nWhat could he have? He called preflop from SB with short stack. Could have small pairs, suited connectors, maybe A5, A6, etc. He bet flop into me - could be betting a pair, a draw, or bluff. He called my raise - suggests he has something: maybe a pair (5x, 6x), a draw (like 7x), or a weak hand he's floating with.\n\nGiven he has only 4 chips left, he's pot-committed. He'll call any bet with any piece. So I should bet for value. My equity is decent: roughly 8 outs to straight (32% by river), plus some pair outs. Against his range, I might have 30-40% equity.\n\nIf I bet 8 (minimum raise), he calls 4 (all-in). Pot becomes 72. I'm investing 8 to win 72, but I only get 4 from him (the rest is already in pot). Actually, my bet of 8 goes into pot, his call of 4 goes in. So total pot: 60 + 8 + 4 = 72. My investment: 8. So I need 8/72 = 11% equity to break even. I have way more than that.\n\nIf I check, I get a free river card. But I give up potential value from worse hands. He might have a worse draw or weak pair that would call. Given he's so short, I should bet to get his last 4 chips.\n\nBut wait: If I bet 8 and he calls 4, effectively I'm risking 8 to win his 4 plus the 60 pot. So 8 to win 64? Actually: If I win, I get 60 + 8 + 4 = 72, but "

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm on the button with Td 9s. The board is 5c 6s 8h 8d. I have a straight draw (7 gives me a straight with 5-6-7-8-9, and T-9 gives me a pair of tens or nines). Actually, I have an open-ended straight draw: I need a 7 to complete a 5-6-7-8-9 straight. Also, any T or 9 gives me a pair. \n\nThe pot is 60 chips. My opponent MiniMax-M2 has only 32 chips total (he's very short stacked). He checked to me on the turn. He bet 8 on the flop and called my raise of 16 (so he put in 8 more). \n\nLooking at opponent history: MiniMax-M2 has been playing fairly tight - folded preflop in hands 21-23, raised in hands 24-25, then folded in 26, checked in 27. In hand 25, he raised preflop then bet 4 on flop. He seems to be playing aggressively when he has hands.\n\nMy hand is decent with the straight draw and potential pair. The board has paired 8s, which reduces the likelihood he has an 8. My raise on the flop represented strength. He called, which suggests he has something - maybe a pair, a draw, or a weak hand he's floating with.\n\nGiven his short stack (32 chips total), he's likely to call any bet with any decent hand. I have position and a draw. I should probably bet for value and to put pressure on him. A small bet might get him to fold weak hands, but he might call with any piece. \n\nPot is 60, he has 32 total. If I bet 16 (half pot), he'd have to call 16 into 76 pot, getting about 4.75:1 odds. That's good odds for him if he has any draw or pair. But he only has 16 chips left after calling (32-16=16). \n\nActually, let me calculate: He started with 32 chips. He put in 2 SB preflop, called 10 more preflop (total 12), bet 8 on flop, called 8 more on flop (total 28). So he has 4 chips left! Wait, that can't be right. Let me recalculate:\n\nStarting stack: 32 chips\nPreflop: SB 2 + call 10 = 12 invested, 20 left\nFlop: bet 8 (12 left) + call 8 (4 left)\nSo he has 4 chips remaining!\n\nThat's important. He has only 4 chips left. So any bet I make, he's basically pot-committed. He'll likely call with almost anything.\n\nGiven this, I should probably bet his remaining 4 chips to get maximum value. If I check, I give him a free river card. But if I bet, he'll likely call with any piece. My hand has decent equity: I have 8 outs to a straight (four 7s), plus 6 outs to a pair (three Ts, three 9s, though one 9 might be counterfeited if he has a better pair). Actually, I should discount the pair outs somewhat. \n\nBetter to bet small to get value from worse hands. But he only has 4 chips, so I should bet 4 to put him all-in. That's the minimum raise amount is 8, but I can bet 4 as a \"bet\" not a raise? Wait, the legal actions are fold, check, raise. The amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise. Minimum raise to: 8. That means if I want to bet, I have to raise to at least 8 total? Actually, \"raise_to\" is the total amount I'm putting in. Currently I have 0 in this street. So raising to 8 means putting in 8 chips. That's more than his remaining 4.\n\nBut actually, I think I can just bet 4. Let me check: \"Legal actions: fold, check, raise\" - no \"bet\" option. But since amount to call is 0, I can check or raise. To bet, I would need to raise to some amount. The minimum raise to is 8, meaning I need to put in at least 8 chips. That's fine - he only has 4 left, so he can only call 4. So if I raise to 8, he can call 4 more and be all-in.\n\nActually, wait: He has 4 chips. If I raise to 8 (putting in 8 chips), he would need to call 8 to match? No,",

Also potential pair with T or 9. Opponent MiniMax-M2 has only 4 chips left (from 32 total). He checked to me on the turn.\n\nHe bet 8 on flop (into ~28 pot? Let me calculate: Preflop pot was: SB 2 + BB 4 + my raise 12 + his call 10 = 28 chips. Then on flop he bet 8, I raised to 16 total (so additional 8), he called 8 more. So pot after flop: 28 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 52? Wait, that doesn't match pot size of 60. Let me recalculate properly:\n\nPreflop:\n- SB (MiniMax-M2): 2\n- BB (GPT-OSS-120B): 4  \n- My raise: 12 (total)\n- MiniMax-M2 call: 10 more (he already put 2, so total 12)\n- BB fold\n\nSo preflop pot: 2 + 4 + 12 = 18? No, that's not right. Actually: SB 2, BB 4, my raise 12 (total), MiniMax calls 10 more. So total in pot: 2 (SB) + 4 (BB) + 12 (me) + 10 (MiniMax) = 28 chips.\n\nFlop:\nMiniMax bets 8 (pot now 36)\nI raise to 16 total (so I put in 8 more? Actually I need to put in 16 total this street, but I haven't put anything yet. So I put in 16, making pot: 28 + 8 + 16 = 52)\nMiniMax calls 8 more (he already bet 8, needs to call 8 more to match my 16, so he puts in 8 more, pot: 52 + 8 = 60)\n\nYes, pot is 60. He has 4 chips left.\n\nNow turn: He checks. I have option to check or raise. Minimum raise to: 8. That means if I want to bet, I need to put in at least 8 chips. He only has 4 chips, so he can only call 4. The pot would then be 60 + 8 + 4 = 72.\n\nMy hand: Td 9s. I have 8 clean outs to a straight (four 7s). I also have 6 outs to a pair (three Ts, three 9s), but some of these might not be clean if he has a better pair. The board has paired 8s, so if he has an 8, I'm drawing dead to a straight. But he likely doesn't have an 8 given his flop bet/call line.\n\nWhat could he have? He called preflop from SB with short stack. Could have small pairs, suited connectors, maybe A5, A6, etc. He bet flop into me - could be betting a pair, a draw, or bluff. He called my raise - suggests he has something: maybe a pair (5x, 6x), a draw (like 7x), or a weak hand he's floating with.\n\nGiven he has only 4 chips left, he's pot-committed. He'll call any bet with any piece. So I should bet for value. My equity is decent: roughly 8 outs to straight (32% by river), plus some pair outs. Against his range, I might have 30-40% equity.\n\nIf I bet 8 (minimum raise), he calls 4 (all-in). Pot becomes 72. I'm investing 8 to win 72, but I only get 4 from him (the rest is already in pot). Actually, my bet of 8 goes into pot, his call of 4 goes in. So total pot: 60 + 8 + 4 = 72. My investment: 8. So I need 8/72 = 11% equity to break even. I have way more than that.\n\nIf I check, I get a free river card. But I give up potential value from worse hands. He might have a worse draw or weak pair that would call. Given he's so short, I should bet to get his last 4 chips.\n\nBut wait: If I bet 8 and he calls 4, effectively I'm risking 8 to win his 4 plus the 60 pot. So 8 to win 64? Actually: If I win, I get 60 + 8 + 4 = 72, but ",

I have an open-ended straight draw (need a 7). Opponent MiniMax-M2 has only 4 chips left out of his original 32. He checked to me on the turn. Pot is 60 chips.\n\nMy options: check or raise (minimum raise to 8). If I raise to 8, he can only call 4 (all-in). So effectively I'm betting 8 to win his last 4 chips plus the existing pot.\n\nMy hand has decent equity: 8 outs to a straight (four 7s) = about 17% chance to hit on river (8/44 \u2248 18%). Actually 8/46 \u2248 17.4%. Plus some chance my pair outs are good (T or 9 giving me a pair). But those might not be clean if he has a better pair.\n\nHe called preflop from SB with short stack, bet flop, called my raise. What could he have? Possibly a pair (5x, 6x), maybe a draw like 7x, or a weak hand. The paired 8s on board reduce likelihood he has an 8.\n\nGiven he has only 4 chips left, he's essentially pot-committed. He'll call any bet with any piece. So betting is for value. Even if I'm behind, I have decent equity and the pot odds are good.\n\nIf I bet 8 and he calls 4: total pot = 60 + 8 + 4 = 72. My investment = 8. So I need 8/72 \u2248 11% equity to break even. I have at least 17% equity to hit my straight, plus some chance my pair is good or he folds (though he won't fold with 4 chips).\n\nIf I check, I get a free river card but give up value from worse hands. He might have a worse draw or weak pair that would have called.\n\nGiven the math and situation, I should bet. The minimum raise is to 8, which is fine. He'll call 4 all-in.\n\nLet me also consider tournament implications: I have 212 chips (53 BB). He has 4 chips. Winning this pot would give me ~72 chips profit (60 pot + his 4 + my 8 back). Actually, if I win, I get 72 total, of which 60 was already in pot, 4 is his, 8 is mine. So net gain of 4 chips from his stack plus the 60 pot that's already there. Actually careful: If I bet 8 and he calls 4, and I win, I get back 72. My net profit = 72 - 8 = 64. If I lose, I lose 8. So risk 8 to win 64. That's 8:64 = 1:8 odds. I need only 11% equity.\n\nI have more than 11% equity. So betting is +EV.\n\nAlso, if I check and hit my straight on river, I might not get any more value since he only has 4 chips. If I check and miss, I might have to fold if he bets his last 4 (though he'd likely check again).\n\nBetting now gets value. I'll raise to 8 (minimum).

This is a weak hand, especially from UTG position.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (early position) - worst position at the table. We have to act first post-flop against multiple players.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 272 chips (68 BB) - healthy stack\n   - Seat 1 (BB): 365 chips - big stack\n   - Seat 4: 32 chips - very short stack\n   - Seat 5 (SB): 119 chips\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression with raises (hands 20, 23), but mostly folds. Showdown with KK in hand 9.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Mostly folds, one raise in hand 21, one call in hand 25.\n   \n5. **Tournament considerations**: We have a decent stack (68 BB). No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands from early position.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Only 4 chips to call into 6 chip pot (1.5:1 odds). But with 7-5 suited, we're looking for implied odds if we hit a strong hand.\n\n7. **Key factors against playing**:\n   - UTG position with weak hand\n   - Still 4 players left to act (SB, BB, and folded seat 2)\n   - 7-5 suited needs perfect flop to continue (flush draw, straight draw, two pair)\n   - Playing OOP (out of position) makes it hard to realize equity\n\n8. **Key factors for playing**:\n   - Suited connectors can make strong hands\n   - Deep stacks allow implied odds\n   - Could steal if everyone folds\n\nHowever, from UTG with 7-5 suited, this is a clear fold in tournament poker. The hand is too weak to open from early position. Even if we call, we'll be playing a weak hand out of position against potentially multiple opponents.\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger hand in better position. With 68 BB, we can afford to be patient.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"7-5 suited is too weak to play from UTG position.

Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has raised preflop in some hands (Hand 20, 23)\n2. Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has raised preflop (Hand 21, 22), also called (Hand 27)\n3. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Very short stack (38 chips)\n4. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): 119 chips\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- K9o is a weak hand from UTG. It's not a premium hand and should generally be folded from early position.\n- With 68 BB stack, I don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n- There are 4 players left to act after me (Seats 4, 5, 1, 2).\n- The short stack (MiniMax-M2) might be looking to go all-in.\n- K9o has some high card value but is easily dominated by better kings (AK, KQ, KJ) and pairs.\n- In tournament poker, preserving chips is important, especially with a healthy stack.\n\n**Position disadvantage:** As UTG, I'll be out of position for the entire hand if I enter.\n\n**Pot odds:** To call 4 chips into a pot of 6, I'm getting 1.5:1 odds, but implied odds are poor with a weak hand.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a clear fold. K9o from UTG is not playable in a tournament setting with a healthy stack. Better to wait for stronger hands in better positions.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K9o is too weak to play from UTG with a healthy 68 BB stack.

Suited connectors need good implied odds to justify playing, and being out of position makes it harder to realize equity. Additionally, the opponent's raise size (3x) is standard, but we don't have a strong read that they're overly loose.\n\nGiven the positional disadvantage and weak hand strength, I should fold. Better to preserve my stack and wait for better spots, especially since I have a healthy stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"94s is too weak to call from out of position against a standard raise.

With implied odds if I hit a good flop, could be profitable.\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack, can afford to play speculative hands in position.\n\n**Options**:\n- **Fold**: Conservative play with marginal hand.\n- **Call**: Take favorable position with decent pot odds.\n- **Raise**: Could try to steal blinds given tight opponents.\n\nGiven the tightness of both opponents (especially Seat 5 who folds almost always preflop), and my excellent position, I think a small raise could be profitable. If I raise, Seat 5 (SB) will likely fold given their tight tendencies, and Seat 1 (BB) might fold too based on recent folding pattern.\n\nHowever, 98o is not a great hand to raise with from button against only blinds. But with such tight opponents, it might work. Alternatively, I could just call and see a flop cheaply.\n\nActually, let me check: Minimum raise to is 8 chips total (4 more). That's not much - just doubling the BB. If I raise to 8 total (4 more), I'm risking 4 more chips for potential to win 6 chips now.\n\nGiven Seat 5's extreme tightness (folded 9 of last 10 preflop), I think a small raise has good chance of success. Even if called, I have position.\n\nI'll go with a small raise."

This is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**: Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, SB) has raised to 12 total (8 more to call). Looking at their raise history: they've raised preflop frequently (8 times in 34 hands). Their raises vary in size: 6, 12, 18, 24. The 12 raise is on the smaller side. They showed Tc 7d in one showdown, suggesting they can raise with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 268 chips (67 BB), opponent has 231 chips (57.75 BB). Both deep stacked.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 16 chips (4 from me as BB, 2 from SB, 10 raise). I need to call 8 to win 16, giving me 2:1 odds (33% equity needed).\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: We're both deep, so not desperate. I have a comfortable stack.\n\n7. **Alternatives**: \n   - Fold: KJo out of position against a raise isn't great\n   - Call: Reasonable given pot odds and hand strength\n   - Raise: Could 3-bet, but KJo isn't a great 3-bet bluff candidate from BB\n\nGiven the pot odds (33% equity needed) and KJo having ~40% equity against a typical SB raising range, calling seems reasonable. I'm getting good immediate odds, and I have position on the flop (they act first postflop since they're SB). However, being out of position overall is a concern.\n\nLooking at my history: I've been folding a lot (24 folds out of 34 hands). Might be good to defend my blind occasionally with a decent hand.\n\nI'll call and see a flop.",

I have Ks Jc which is a pretty good hand - King high with a Jack kicker. The board shows 5c 9s 8d - all low cards, so my King is likely the high card.\n\nGiven the tournament context and my stack size (260 chips, healthy), I should be playing to win chips. My hand is strong enough to warrant a raise. The minimum raise is 8 chips, which is small relative to my stack and the pot (24 chips).\n\nLooking at my recent history, I've been folding too much (24 folds out of 34 hands) with a 29% win rate. I need to be more aggressive. This hand looks favorable - I have a King high, board has low cards.\n\nI should raise to put pressure and potentially win the pot. Since amount to call is 0, I need to either check (free) or raise (minimum 8). With a good hand like Ks Jc, raising seems correct.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Ks Jc is strong hand with King high, board has low cards (5c 9s 8d).

The pot is currently 18 (2 from SB, 4 from BB, 12 from raise). If I call, pot would be 28.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop in 3 out of 10 hands (hand 31, 35, and now 36). They raised to 12 each time. They've shown down Tc 7d in hand 30, so they're not playing premium hands only.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) in the BB has folded most hands, except one raise in hand 34. They have a short stack of 121 chips.\n\nMy hand Ts 3h is terrible - no suitedness, no connectivity, Ten-high with a weak kicker. I'm out of position (small blind) against a raiser. Even if I hit a Ten, I'm likely dominated. The pot odds are: need to call 10 to win 28, which is about 2.8:1 or 26% equity needed.\n\nWith Ts 3h, I probably have around 25-30% equity against a typical raising range, but being out of position makes it worse. Also, there's still the BB to act behind me, though they've been folding a lot.\n\nIn tournament poker, with 70.5 BB stack, I should avoid playing marginal hands out of position. This is an easy fold. No reason to waste chips with such a weak hand.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. I'm the small blind, so I already have 2 chips invested, but that's a sunk cost. Better to save the remaining 10 chips.",

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (folded last 5 preflop decisions). Only one showdown shows KK (big pair). Seems tight.\n2. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Short stack (111 chips, ~28 BB). Has been folding a lot but showed one raise (hand 34) and one call (hand 36). Currently posted SB.\n\n**My Hand Evaluation:**\n7\u2665 8\u2663 is a speculative hand. As offsuit connectors, it has some potential to make straights but is otherwise weak. On the button with only the blinds to act, this is a reasonable stealing spot.\n\n**Position Advantage:** Being on the button gives me maximum postflop advantage. I can see how both opponents react before I act on later streets.\n\n**Stack Considerations:** \n- I have 70.5 BB, which is healthy.\n- Seat 5 is short (28 BB) and might be looking to defend/play hands.\n- Seat 1 has a big stack but seems tight.\n\n**Tournament Context:** \n- I have a decent stack, can afford to take some risks.\n- Button steals are profitable in tournament poker.\n- With only 3 players at the table (2 opponents), stealing becomes more valuable.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Fold: Safest play, but gives up a profitable stealing opportunity.\n2. Call: Not ideal with 78o - I want to either steal or fold. Calling invites the blinds to see a cheap flop.\n3. Raise: Standard button steal attempt. Should be around 2.5-3x BB.\n\n**Raise Sizing:** Minimum raise to 8 (2x BB) or slightly larger to 10-12 (2.5-3x BB). Since it's just the blinds, a small raise might work.\n\nGiven Seat 1's tight folding tendencies and Seat 5's short stack, a raise has good fold equity. Even if called, I have position.\n\nI'll raise to 10 chips (2.5x BB). This is enough to pressure the blinds while not risking too much."

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (folded last 5 preflop decisions). Only one showdown shows KK (big pair). Seems tight.\n2. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Short stack (111 chips, ~28 BB). Has been folding a lot but showed one raise (hand 34) and one call (hand 36). Currently posted SB.\n\n**My Hand Evaluation:**\n7\u2665 8\u2663 is a speculative hand. As offsuit connectors, it has some potential to make straights but is otherwise weak. On the button with only the blinds to act, this is a reasonable stealing spot.\n\n**Position Advantage:** Being on the button gives me maximum postflop advantage. I can see how both opponents react before I act on later streets.\n\n**Stack Considerations:** \n- I have 70.5 BB, which is healthy.\n- Seat 5 is short (28 BB) and might be looking to defend/play hands.\n- Seat 1 has a big stack but seems tight.\n\n**Tournament Context:** \n- I have a decent stack, can afford to take some risks.\n- Button steals are profitable in tournament poker.\n- With only 3 players at the table (2 opponents), stealing becomes more valuable.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Fold: Safest play, but gives up a profitable stealing opportunity.\n2. Call: Not ideal with 78o - I want to either steal or fold. Calling invites the blinds to see a cheap flop.\n3. Raise: Standard button steal attempt. Should be around 2.5-3x BB.\n\n**Raise Sizing:** Minimum raise to 8 (2x BB) or slightly larger to 10-12 (2.5-3x BB). Since it's just the blinds, a small raise might work.\n\nGiven Seat 1's tight folding tendencies and Seat 5's short stack, a raise has good fold equity. Even if called, I have position.\n\nI'll raise to 10 chips (2.5x BB). This is enough to pressure the blinds while not risking too much.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm on the button with 7h8c. I raised to 10, and the small blind (seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) has raised to 111 total (which is effectively all-in since they only have 2 chips left? Wait, they have 2 chips according to the stack display, but they raised to 111? That doesn't make sense. Let me check: seat 5 has 2 chips according to the player list, but they raised to 111. That seems like a mistake. Actually, looking at the action: \"Seat 5 raise 111\" after I raised to 10. The small blind already posted 2, so they're putting in 111 total, which is 101 more to me. But they only have 2 chips? Something is off.\n\nWait, maybe the stack display is wrong, or maybe seat 5 has more chips than shown. Let me re-read: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 2 chips\" but they raised to 111. That would require them to have at least 111 chips. This is confusing.\n\nLet me think about the pot: blinds 2/4, pot is 125 chips. That includes: SB 2, BB 4, my raise 10, SB's raise 111. That's 2+4+10+111 = 127, close to 125. Maybe there's rounding.\n\nRegardless, I have 78o on the button. I raised preflop, which is a bit loose but positionally okay. Now facing a massive re-raise. The opponent in seat 5 has been mostly folding preflop based on history, with one raise and one call recently. They have 2 chips left (if the display is accurate), so this is essentially an all-in situation.\n\nMy stack is 272 chips (68 BB). I need to call 101 to win a pot of 125+101 = 226? Actually, pot is 125 now, I need to call 101, so pot would be 226 if I call. That's pot odds of 101 to win 226, or about 1:2.2, meaning I need about 31% equity.\n\nWith 78o against a likely strong range from a short stack shove, I'm probably not getting 31% equity. Even against a tight range like {TT+, AK, AQ}, 78o has only about 24% equity. Against a wider range like {22+, A2s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KJo+, QJo}, it's about 32%. But given this opponent has been folding a lot and suddenly makes a huge raise, they likely have a strong hand.\n\nAlso, tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (68 BB), no need to gamble with 78o. Folding preserves my stack.\n\nThe BB folded, so it's just me against the SB. The SB has effectively shoved (if they only have 2 chips, this raise puts them all-in). Even if they have more chips, this is a huge raise relative to the pot.\n\nI should fold. The hand is too weak, the price isn't great, and I'm out of position postflop if I call (actually I'm button, SB is out of position, but still).\n\nLet me check if there's any other info. The opponent in seat 5 raised once before in hand 34 (to 10). That's the only raise I see. They called once in hand 36. Not much history.\n\nDecision: fold.",

Seems capable of aggression.\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2, 241 chips): Has raised preflop multiple times (hands 31, 35, 36). Shows aggression.\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, 345 chips): Mostly folds, but has called SB and bet flop once.\n\nI'm UTG, so there are 4 players left to act after me (SB, BB, and two others). With J4o, this is a clear fold from UTG. The hand has very little potential - it's not suited, not connected, and both cards are low. Even if I hit a J, I'll often be dominated by better jacks. The 4 is practically useless.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (68 BB), so I should preserve it and wait for better spots. There's no reason to play this marginal hand from early position.\n\nPot odds: I'd need to call 4 to win 6, getting 1.5:1 odds, but with such a weak hand and poor position, the implied odds are terrible.\n\nDecision: Fold.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the small blind with 5d Td. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 total. I need to call 10 more. My stack is 284 (71 BB). Let me think about opponent tendencies. From the recall, Kimi-K2 has raised preflop 9 times, with varying amounts: 18, 6, 6, 6, 24, 12, 12, 12, 12. So they seem to be raising frequently, with recent raises mostly to 12 (3x BB). This is a standard raise size.\n\nMy hand is 5d Td - suited, but not great. Ten-five suited is a weak hand. I'm out of position (SB) and will have to act first postflop. The pot is currently 18 (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise). If I call 10, pot becomes 28, and I have to play out of position with a weak hand.\n\nThe big blind (Seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) has 123 chips and hasn't acted yet. They could call or raise. Their stack is shorter (30.75 BB).\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I have 71 BB, which is a healthy stack. I should avoid marginal situations out of position with weak hands. 5d Td is not a hand I want to defend from the SB against a raise, even suited. The suitedness gives some potential, but the gap between 5 and 10 is large, making straight potential weaker.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 10 to win 28 (current pot after my call would be 28). That's about 2.8:1 odds, or 26% equity needed. Against a typical raising range, 5d Td has maybe 30-35% equity, so mathematically it might be close. But being out of position reduces my effective odds significantly.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for better spots. I'm not desperate for chips with 71 BB. Let me check if there are any other factors.\n\nI should also consider that the BB might squeeze, putting me in a tough spot. Folding seems correct.",

They seem to be playing a somewhat aggressive style.\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has mostly folded preflop, with one raise in hand #39 where they raised to 12 then folded to a re-raise.\n\nBeing UTG with 9s8s is a weak position for this hand. Suited connectors need good implied odds and position to play effectively. From UTG, I'll have to act first postflop, which is disadvantageous. The blinds are small (4/8), so calling 8 chips represents about 2.8% of my stack.\n\nHowever, there are several players left to act who could raise, especially Kimi-K2 in Seat 2 who has shown aggression. If I call and then face a raise, I'll have to fold and lose 8 chips.\n\nBetter to fold this hand from UTG. 9s8s is not strong enough to open from UTG, especially with aggressive players behind me. I should wait for better spots with position.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations... Tournament stage? Blinds are still small relative to stacks.

I posted SB 4, opponent posted BB 8, I called to complete, opponent checked.\n\nThe flop is Kd 6s 7h. I have Jh 8s - not a great hand. I have a gutshot straight draw (9-T gives me a straight) and a backdoor flush draw with the spade. No pair, no real equity.\n\nLooking at opponent's tendencies from the recall:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been folding a lot preflop (6 of last 10 actions were folds)\n- Only one raise preflop (hand #37, raised to 111)\n- In hand #40, they called BB, checked flop, then folded when facing action\n- They seem fairly passive/weak\n\nThe pot is 16 chips. I'm in position. My hand has limited equity but some potential. With opponent having only 103 chips (12.9 BB), they're relatively short-stacked.\n\nGiven that:\n1. My hand has some draw potential (gutshot + backdoor flush)\n2. I'm in position\n3. Opponent has shown weakness (lots of folds)\n4. The board is fairly dry (K high, no flush draws)\n5. Pot is small\n\nI should probably take a stab at it with a bet. A small bet might take it down now. Even if called, I have position and can see a turn card. My stack is healthy at 35 BB.\n\nHowever, Jh 8s is pretty weak. Let me think about sizing. Minimum raise is 8 (half pot). I could bet 8-12 chips.\n\nActually, wait - I should consider that opponent has only 103 chips. If I bet and they call or raise, I could be committing myself with a weak hand. But given their passive tendencies, they might just fold.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's stack: 103 chips. If I bet 12 chips (3/4 pot), they'd have to call 12 into a 28 chip pot (2.3:1 odds). That's a reasonable bet.\n\nBut my hand is truly weak. Maybe a check is better? Let me think...\n\nActually, I'm in position with initiative. A bet could win the pot immediately. If I check, I give opponent a free card and they might bet on turn if they have something.\n\nI think a small bet is reasonable. If they call or raise, I can easily fold on turn.\n\nLet me bet 8 chips (half pot). That's small enough to not commit too much but enough to apply pressure.",

They've been folding a lot too, called once preflop (hand #40) and checked once (hand #44).\n\n**Action:** It's folded to me on the button. Only SB (4 chips) and BB (8 chips) have posted. I need to call 8 chips to see a flop.\n\n**Hand Strength:** K5s is not a great hand, but on the button against potentially tight opponents, it has some playability.

The SB is very short-stacked and might be looking to shove with any decent hand soon.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Conservative play with a marginal hand.\n2. **Call:** See a cheap flop in position with a speculative hand.\n3. **Raise:** Take initiative and try to win the pot preflop.\n\nGiven the opponents' tendencies (both seem fairly tight/foldy), and my position, I think calling is reasonable. Raising with K5s might be too aggressive given the hand strength.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have more information. Looking at the opponent data:\n\n1. **Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, Seat 1)**: Has raised preflop 5 times in 45 hands. Raises have been small (6-12 chips). This suggests they might not be super aggressive but will raise with decent hands.\n\n2. **GPT-OSS-120B (SB, Seat 5)**: Has raised preflop 5 times including one large raise of 111 chips (hand #37). This is interesting - they have a very short stack (99 chips) and have shown willingness to go all-in preflop. This suggests they might be looking to shove with any decent hand given their short stack.\n\n3. **My recent hands**: I've been folding a lot (30 folds out of 44 hands). Won hand #44 from SB with J8o by calling and betting flop.\n\n**Current situation**: K5s on the button. SB has 99 chips (12.4 BB) and has shown willingness to shove. BB has 325 chips and raises sometimes. \n\nIf I call 8 chips:\n- SB might shove (they have 95 chips left after posting SB)\n- BB might raise\n- I have position but might face aggression\n\nWith K5s, this is a marginal hand. The suited aspect helps but it's still weak. Given the short stack in SB who might shove, and the BB who might raise, calling could put me in a tough spot if there's action behind me.\n\nHowever, I'm on the button with position. If both just check/call, I can see a flop cheaply. If SB shoves, I'd likely fold K5s. If BB raises, I'd likely fold.\n\nGiven my stack (37 BB) and tournament considerations, I think folding is reasonable here. K5s is not a great hand, and while button position is good, facing potential aggression from short stack and BB makes it tricky. I'd rather wait for better spots.\n\nI'll fold.",

Looking at opponent tendencies:\n\nSeat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Seems to be playing fairly tight preflop, mostly folding. In hand 45, they called from SB and then called flop, bet turn. They had a small raise in hand 39 but folded to action.\n\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop a couple times (hands 36 and 40), seems somewhat aggressive when they do play.\n\nSeat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Very tight player, mostly folding. In hand 45 they raised to 16 preflop (2x BB) and then bet flop, check-folded turn. They have only 79 chips (9.9 BB) so they're short-stacked.\n\nMy stack: 296 chips (37 BB) - healthy but not huge.\n\nWith J8o from UTG, this is a clear fold. The hand has very little playability from early position. It's suited connectors or high cards that can play well multi-way, but J8o is dominated by many hands and will often be in tough spots postflop. \n\nEven if I limp, there are 3 players left to act who could raise, putting me in a bad spot. Seat 5 is short-stacked and might shove with any decent hand. Seat 2 has shown some aggression.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot, especially since I have a decent stack and don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been playing too tight or loose.",

Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has only 79 chips but hasn't acted yet.\n\nI need to consider: J8o is a very weak hand from UTG. Standard play would be to fold this hand. However, I should think about tournament dynamics. I have 37 BB, which is a healthy stack. The short stack at Seat 5 has only 79 chips (less than 10 BB), which could affect play.\n\nLet me consider if there's any reason to play this hand. J8o has very little potential - it's not suited, not connected. From UTG, I should be playing tight. The pot is 12 chips, I need to call 8 to see a flop. That's 2.7% of my stack.\n\nBut wait, I should check opponent tendencies. However, I can't use tools without proper format. Actually, I should just make a decision based on standard poker theory.\n\nJ8o from UTG is an easy fold. Even if I were in later position, it's marginal. From UTG, definitely fold. The only consideration might be if opponents are very passive or if I have a strong read, but without information, standard play is fold.\n\nAlso, Seat 5 is very short-stacked (79 chips, <10 BB). They might be looking to go all-in soon. My J8o doesn't want to play against potential all-ins.\n\nI should fold. This preserves my stack for better spots.",

Pot is 20 chips. Only opponent is Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) who called. Amount to call is 0, so I can check. Legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nI should think about this hand. I have 7s 5c, which is a very weak hand offsuit. I'm in the big blind, already posted 8 chips. The opponent just called from UTG (Seat 1). They didn't raise. That suggests they have a marginal hand, not premium. But 7-5 offsuit is terrible. Even with pot odds (I can check for free), this hand has very little potential. It's a speculative hand that needs to hit a miracle flop to continue.\n\nGiven my stack size (36 BB), I don't want to get involved with such a weak hand. Even though it's free to check, playing 7-5 offsuit out of position against one opponent is generally -EV. I should just check and see the flop, but folding might be better to preserve my stack for better spots. However, folding would mean giving up my 8-chip blind, which is already in the pot. Since I can check for free, I might as well see the flop and then fold if I don't hit anything.\n\nBut wait, I could also raise. Raising with 7-5 offsuit would be a bluff, trying to take down the pot preflop. But opponent called from UTG, so they likely have some hand. Raising might get them to fold weak hands, but if they call, I'm out of position with a terrible hand.\n\nBetter to check and see a flop. If I hit something like two pair or a straight draw, I can continue. Otherwise, fold on the flop.\n\nLet me check opponent tendencies first using recall_opponent_actions. But I need to output JSON. I'll make a decision based on general principles. Since I can check for free, I'll check. That seems standard.\n\nBut the system says \"Invalid response format\" because I tried to use tools. I should just respond with JSON. Let me think: with 7-5 offsuit in BB facing a limp from UTG, standard play is to check. I'll check.\n\nResponse JSON: action: check, raise_to: null, reasoning: \"7-5 offsuit is weak but checking is free. Will see flop and evaluate.\"",

They have shown down Tc 7d in hand #30, which suggests they might raise with marginal hands.\n\nSeat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is in the BB and hasn't acted yet. They also raise frequently preflop (9 times). They showed KK in hand #9.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\nK4o is a weak hand. King-high with a weak kicker. It's not suited, so no flush potential. The hand plays poorly postflop unless we hit a king, and even then we have kicker issues. In position on the button, we have some advantage, but the hand is too weak to call a 3x raise.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 35.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. Seat 5 (SB) has only 87 chips (10.9 BB) and is short-stacked. Seat 2 (raiser) has 227 chips (28.4 BB). Seat 1 (BB) has 357 chips (44.6 BB).\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI should preserve my stack with weak hands. K4o is a clear fold against a raise. Even with position, the hand doesn't have enough equity or implied odds to justify calling 24 chips (8.5% of my stack).\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 36, need to call 24. Pot odds: 24/(36+24) = 24/60 = 40%. We need >40% equity to call. K4o vs a typical raising range has maybe 30-35% equity at best.\n\n**Decision:**\nClear fold. The hand is too weak, and we're not getting good enough pot odds. Better to wait for a stronger spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K4o is too weak to call a 3x raise from early position. Hand has poor postflop playability and kicker issues. Pot odds of 40% require more equity than K4o offers against a typical raising range. Better to preserve stack for stronger spots.\"\n}",

There are two Kimi-K2 opponents (one is \"Thinking\" variant) and GPT-OSS-120B with 87 chips (short stack).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2): Recently raised to 24 preflop in hand 49, and bet 40 on flop. Seems somewhat aggressive.\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1): Mostly calls preflop, sometimes bets postflop.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5): Has raised preflop a couple times, including an all-in raise to 71 in hand 48. Short stack (87 chips) might be looking to push.\n\nMy hand A8o is weak, especially from UTG. Ace-rag offsuit is a fold from early position in most tournament strategies. I have 35.5 BB, which is a healthy stack, so I don't need to take marginal spots.\n\nConsidering position: I'm first to act, so if I call or raise, I'll have to play out of position against potentially multiple opponents. With A8o, I'm dominated by any ace with a better kicker, and it's hard to make strong hands postflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 12 (pot is 12). That's 2:3 odds, but implied odds are poor since I'm out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack relative to blinds. No need to gamble with weak hands from early position. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I've been folding a lot (folded last 5 hands). But that doesn't mean I should play weak hands.\n\nConclusion: Fold. A8o from UTG is not playable in a tournament setting with healthy stack.\n\nWait, let me check if there are any antes or other factors. No, just blinds.\n\nI should fold.",

While pot odds are 2:1, the hand has poor equity and position disadvantage. Opponent has shown aggressive tendencies but folding preserves stack for better spots with 34.5 BB remaining.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in the BB with 9c Td (off-suit nine-ten)\n- My stack: 276 chips (34.5 BB)\n- Opponent (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) raised to 24 total (SB to BB raise)\n- Amount to call: 16 chips\n- Pot: 32 chips (blinds 4+8 + raise 24)\n- Opponent stack: 247 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 9T off-suit is a weak hand. It's a speculative hand that needs help to improve. Not a premium hand by any means.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm out of position (BB vs SB raiser). This is a disadvantage as I'll have to act first on future streets.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** From the recall, Kimi-K2 has been raising preflop frequently (hands 35, 36, 40, 49). In hand #49, they raised to 24 from SB, then bet 40 on flop. They seem somewhat aggressive but not overly wild. They've also folded many hands preflop when facing action.\n\n4. **Pot odds:** Pot is 32, I need to call 16. That's 2:1 pot odds (33% equity needed). With 9T off-suit, I likely don't have 33% equity against a SB raising range. Even against a wide SB stealing range, 9T off-suit has around 40% equity heads-up, but I'm out of position which reduces my effective equity.\n\n5. **Stack considerations:** I have 34.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. Calling 16 chips (2 BB) is 5.8% of my stack. Not huge, but committing with a weak hand out of position is problematic.\n\n6. **Implied odds:** If I hit a good flop (pair, straight draw, two pair), I could potentially win more chips. But 9T off-suit doesn't flop well often, and when it does, it's often second-best hands.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations:** I should be looking for better spots. With 34.5 BB, I don't need to take marginal situations out of position.\n\n**Better alternatives:**\n- Fold: Preserve chips for better spots\n- Raise: Could 3-bet bluff, but with 9T off-suit and out of position, risky\n- Call: Marginal at best\n\nGiven the pot odds are decent (2:1), but the hand is weak and I'm out of position, folding seems correct. The opponent has shown willingness to raise from SB, so they might be stealing, but even against a stealing range, 9T off-suit isn't great.\n\nI should wait for better spots in position or with stronger holdings.",

The only players left to act are the SB (already folded) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B with 79 chips). I have posted SB of 4 chips, and need to call 4 more to complete to BB of 8.\n\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's tendencies from the search:\n- They have raised preflop twice: hand #45 (raised to 16 from BTN) and hand #48 (raised to 71 from SB - huge raise)\n- They've folded many times preflop\n- Their stack is only 79 chips (9.9 BB), so they're short-stacked\n\nMy stack: 272 chips (34 BB) - healthy stack\nOpponent stack: 79 chips (9.9 BB) - very short\n\nWith 2-5 offsuit, this is a trash hand. However, I'm on the button with position, and it only costs 4 more chips to see a flop (pot is 12, I've already invested 4). That's 4 chips to win 12, getting 3:1 pot odds.\n\nBut more importantly, opponent is very short-stacked and could shove any hand. If I call and they shove, I'd have to fold postflop unless I hit something miraculous. 2-5 offsuit has very little potential - needs to hit two pair or better to be confident.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (34 BB) vs opponent's short stack (9.9 BB). I don't need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands. Folding preserves my stack.\n\nLooking at opponent's aggression: They've shown they can make big raises (hand #48 raised to 71 from SB). With only 79 chips total, they might shove any decent hand.\n\nThe pot odds are decent (3:1), but implied odds are poor because opponent is short-stacked. Reverse implied odds are high - I could lose more chips if I hit a marginal hand.\n\nGiven all this, folding is correct. 2-5 offsuit is unplayable even from the button against a short-stacked opponent who could shove.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check the details again.\n\nSeat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 4 chips (according to the player list). But they raised to 87? That would be their entire stack if they only have 4 chips. Actually, looking at the action: \"Seat 5 raise 87\". But if they started with only 4 chips, they can only go all-in for 4. This must be a reporting issue or they have more chips than shown.\n\nWait, let me re-read: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 4 chips\". But they posted SB of 4, so they should have 0 chips left? Actually, if they have 4 chips total, posting SB of 4 would leave them with 0. But they raised to 87, which is impossible.\n\nActually, I think the chip count might be wrong or this is a short stack situation. Let me think about the pot size: Pot is 115 chips. Amount to call is 67. Minimum raise to is 154.\n\nMy stack: 252 chips. I already put in 20, so I have 232 left.\n\nOpponent's raise: They raised to 87 total. They put in SB of 4, then raised to 87, so they added 83 more. If they only had 4 chips total, they couldn't raise to 87. So either:\n1. The chip count display is wrong\n2. They have more chips than shown\n3. This is an all-in situation\n\nGiven that Seat 5 has been folding a lot recently (looking at the opponent actions: folds in hands 46, 47, 49, 50, 51), but raised in hand 48 (to 71) and hand 45 (to 16). So they do raise sometimes.\n\nMy hand: Kc Jd offsuit. This is a decent but not great hand. I'm on the button, which is good position.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 67 to win 115 + 67 = 182. That's about 1:2.7 odds, or about 27% equity needed.\n\nAgainst a typical 3-betting range from a short stack, KJo has maybe 35-40% equity. But if they're very short (effectively all-in), they might be pushing with a wide range.\n\nHowever, I have position advantage postflop if we both have chips left.\n\nWait, if Seat 5 really only has 4 chips, this raise would be an all-in for their last 4 chips. But the raise amount is 87, which suggests they have more chips.\n\nLet me check the action sequence again:\n- Seat 5 post_sb 4\n- Seat 1 post_bb 8  \n- Seat 2 fold\n- Seat 3 (me) raise 20\n- Seat 5 raise 87\n- Seat 1 fold\n\nSo Seat 5 raised from 4 to 87 (adding 83). If they started with 4 chips, they'd be all-in for 4. But the raise is to 87, so they must have at least 87 chips.\n\nActually, looking at the player list: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 4 chips\". This might mean they have 4 chips AFTER posting the SB? Or it's a display error.\n\nRegardless, the decision: I raised to 20, got 3-bet to 87. I need to call 67 more.\n\nGiven opponent's history: They've raised twice in recent hands (hand 45: raise 16, hand 48: raise 71). In hand 48, they raised to 71 preflop. That was a substantial raise.\n\nMy hand is marginal against a 3-bet. KJo doesn't play well against a 3-betting range. I'm out of position if I call? Actually I'm on the button, so I have position.\n\nBut if I call, I'll have 232 - 67 = 165 left, pot will be 115 + 67 + 67 = 249. Effective stack-to-pot ratio would be about 0.66, which is committing.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 31.5 BB, which is a medium stack. Seat 5 appears to be short-stacked (if the 4 chips is accurate, they're desperate).\n\nI think folding is reasonable here. KJo is not strong enough to call a 3-bet, especially when the opponent has shown willingness to raise. Better to preserve my stack"

Seems somewhat aggressive but also folds frequently.\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Mostly folds preflop, occasionally calls. More passive.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: No data yet.\n\n**Position Considerations:**\n- Being UTG with 78o is very weak. This is a clear fold from early position.\n- We have 3 players left to act after us (SB, BB, and GPT-OSS-120B).\n- The blinds are 4/8, so calling 8 chips is 3.1% of our stack.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- We have 31.5 BB, which is a workable stack. No need to take marginal spots.\n- 78o has poor playability postflop, especially from out of position.\n- The hand has some speculative value (can make straights) but not worth playing from UTG.\n\n**Decision:**\nClear fold. 78o is too weak to open from UTG. Better to wait for better spots. The pot odds (8 to win 12) aren't compelling enough given the hand strength and position disadvantage.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"78o is too weak to open from UTG (early position).

If I raise and get called or re-raised, I'm in a terrible spot with a terrible hand.\n\nLet me check if there's any history with this opponent (Seat 2: Kimi-K2).

The SB (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) just limped in by calling the additional 4 chips to complete the SB.

With 2h6d, I have a terrible hand that will rarely hit the flop well. Even if I do hit a pair, it's a weak pair that's vulnerable.\n\nGiven that I'm in position (I'll act after the SB post-flop) and the pot is small (16 chips), and I have a trash hand, the best play is to check and see a flop. If the flop is terrible, I can easily fold. If I somehow hit something, I can play cautiously.\n\nRaising would be bad with this hand - I'd be bloating the pot with a weak hand. Folding would be too tight heads-up from the BB when I've already put in 8 chips.\n\nSo I should check.",

This is a very connected board with:\n- Straight possibilities: Q8, 8Q, KQ, QK (open-ended straight draws)\n- Flush draw with diamonds\n- Many possible pairs and two-pair hands\n\n**My hand:**\n2\u2665 6\u2666 gives me absolutely nothing.

In hand #49, they raised preflop and then bet on the flop. In hand #51, they raised preflop. They've shown willingness to bet on flops.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 32 chips, I need to call 16 chips. That's 2:1 pot odds (I need 33% equity). My hand has essentially 0% equity against any reasonable range.

Folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm out of position (BB), which makes playing this hand even worse.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is an easy fold.

It's ahead of most of Kimi-K2's raising range. From the opponent data, I see Kimi-K2 has raised to 24 several times before (hands 49 and 51). This seems to be their standard opening raise size.\n\n**Position Considerations:**\nI'm in the SB, so I'll be out of position postflop against the raiser. This is a disadvantage, but with JJ it's worth playing.\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\n- My stack: 240 chips (30 BB) - healthy but not huge\n- Kimi-K2: 267 chips\n- BB (GPT-OSS-120B): 111 chips - short stack that could call or shove\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Too weak with JJ\n2. **Call (20)**: Play pot in position disadvantage\n3. **Raise**: 3-bet to isolate\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWith 30 BB, I need to accumulate chips. JJ is a hand worth playing aggressively. A 3-bet would be good here to isolate the raiser and potentially get heads-up.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should 3-bet. Standard sizing would be to 60-72 total (7.5-9x BB). Since minimum raise is to 40, I'll raise to 60 total (which is 56 more from my current 4).\n\nThis puts pressure on Kimi-K2 and isolates them. If they 4-bet or shove, I'll have a decision, but with JJ and 30 BB, I'm likely committed.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 60,\n  \"reasoning\": \"JJ is a strong hand worth 3-betting from SB against a standard raise.

Short-stacked opponent likely committed with any piece after calling 3-bet preflop.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I have Js Jc (middle set on the flop - very strong!)\n- Board: Jd 7d 9c\n- My stack: 184 chips (23 BB)\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B with only 59 chips total (very short stack)\n- Pot: 144 chips\n- I'm on the button, opponent is in the big blind\n- Preflop action: Seat 2 raised to 24, I 3-bet to 60, GPT-OSS-120B called 52, Seat 2 folded\n- Now on the flop, I have position and it's checked to me\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. **My hand**: Top set with JJ on Jd 7d 9c board. This is an extremely strong hand - only straight draws (T8, 86) or flush draws (diamonds) can beat me right now.\n2. **Opponent stack**: Only 59 chips total. They called my 3-bet preflop with a very short stack.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the data, GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop but made two raises recently (hands 48 and 53). They're short-stacked and likely looking for a spot to double up.\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 144, opponent has 59 total. If I bet, they're getting good odds to call with draws.\n5. **Board texture**: Jd 7d 9c - there's a flush draw (diamonds) and straight draws (T8, 86, maybe QT for gutshot). Also possible two-pair combos like J9, J7, 97.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- With top set, I want to build the pot and get value\n- Opponent is short-stacked (59 chips) - they might be committed with any decent hand\n- I should bet to charge draws and get value from weaker hands\n- Since opponent is so short, I could consider betting enough to put them all-in (they have 59 total, pot is 144)\n- Minimum raise is 36, but I could bet more\n\n**Decision:**\nI should bet to build the pot. Given opponent's short stack, I should bet enough to either get them to commit or fold out their equity. A bet of around 40-50 would leave them with only 9-19 chips behind, making them likely to call with any piece.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: opponent has 59 total. If I bet 50, pot becomes 194, and they'd need to call 50 with 59 behind. That's giving them 3.9:1 odds, which might be too good for draws. I should bet more to price out draws.\n\nBetter to bet 59 (their entire stack) or close to it. That would put them all-in. With top set, I want to get all the money in while I'm ahead.\n\nLet me check: Minimum raise is 36. I could raise to 95 (which would be 35 more than minimum). Actually wait, \"raise_to\" is total amount. Currently pot is 144, amount to call is 0. If I want to bet 59 (putting opponent all-in), I'd need to raise to 59? Let me think...\n\nActually, I need to understand the betting structure. \"Amount to call: 0\" means no bet facing me. If I want to bet 59 chips, I would \"raise\" to 59 (total amount). That's a bet of 59 into 144 pot.\n\nYes, I'll raise to put opponent all-in. With top set on a draw-heavy board, I want to get maximum value and protect against draws.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 59,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Top set on draw-heavy board (flush and straight draws).

Hand is very weak - 4h8h has poor equity against likely ranges\n2. Position is good but doesn't justify playing such a weak hand\n3. Pot odds are decent (3.5:1) but hand needs better implied odds\n4. Risk of squeeze from Seat 1 (BB) or all-in from Seat 5 (SB)\n5. Better to preserve chips with such a marginal hand\n\nGiven the weakness of 4h8h, even with position and decent pot odds, this is a clear fold.

Action: SB posted 4, BB posted 8. Amount to call is 8. Minimum raise to 16. Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nI previously reasoned that KTs from UTG is marginal and I should fold. That seems reasonable. But let me double-check if there's any reason to play this hand.\n\nTable has 5 players: Seat 1 (SB, 325 chips), Seat 2 (BB, 271 chips), Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 (55 chips short stack). Seat 1 is tight, Seat 2 has shown some aggression, Seat 5 is short and aggressive.\n\nFrom UTG, KTs is definitely a fold in most situations. The only reason to play would be if the table is very passive or if I have a strong read. But Seat 2 has shown aggression, so I could get raised behind me. Also, being out of position with a drawing hand like KTs is tough.\n\nWith 41 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. Better to wait for better positions or stronger hands.\n\nSo I'll fold. Need to output JSON: {\"action\": \"fold\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"KTs from UTG is marginal, especially with aggressive players behind. Better to wait for stronger spots with position.\"}\n\nWait, the reasoning should be brief. Let me make it concise.\n\nActually, let me check if there are any other considerations. The short stack at Seat 5 might shove over a raise, which could be problematic. Also, I have no specific reads that the table is particularly weak.\n\nYes, fold is correct. Let me output the JSON.",

Seat 2 (SB) checked, and now it's my action with amount to call = 0.\n\nI have trips, which is a very strong hand on this flop. The only hands that beat me are:\n- QQ for a full house (but that would be three of a kind with a pair on board, making a full house)\n- QT for a full house (ten with queen kicker, but board has two tens, so QT would be two pair with trips on board, not a full house)\n- Actually, let me think: Board is Ts Td Qs. I have 7c Tc. So I have three tens with 7 kicker. Better hands would be:\n  1. QQ (full house: queens full of tens)\n  2. QT (two pair: queens and tens, but with trips on board, this would be a full house: tens full of queens)\n  3. TT (quad tens - impossible since I have one ten)\n  4. Qx where x makes a straight? No straight possible yet.\n\nActually, QT would be a full house (tens full of queens) since board has two tens and one queen. So QT is a full house.\n\nAlso, any hand with a ten and a better kicker than 7 would beat me (JT, T9, T8, AT, KT). But those are just trips with better kicker, not full houses.\n\nThe board is somewhat wet with a flush draw possible (two spades). Qs is on board, so someone could have AsKs for nut flush draw, or other spade combos.\n\nGiven I have trips, I should build the pot. I'm last to act on the flop (after SB checked). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called preflop and hasn't acted yet on flop - actually wait, let me re-read: Actions show Seat 2 checked, and now it's my action. So Seat 1 is still to act after me? Actually the action order: preflop went Seat 5 fold, Seat 1 call, Seat 2 call, Seat 3 check. On flop: Seat 2 check. So I'm next (Seat 3). Then after me would be Seat 1.\n\nSo I'm in middle position on flop with trips. I should bet for value. Looking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has shown various flop actions - bets, calls, folds, checks. Mixed.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has bet on flop several times, also raised once.\n\nThe pot is 24 chips. I should bet around 12-18 chips (half to 3/4 pot). Minimum raise to is 8, but that's too small. I have 320 chips total.\n\nI should bet to get value from hands like Qx, flush draws, straight draws, and other tens with worse kickers. Also to protect against draws.\n\nLet me check if there are any straight draws: Board is T T Q. Possible straight draws would need J9 or J8 or 89? Actually J9 would be open-ended (J9 needs 8 and K? Wait: T T Q board. For J9: needs 8 and K for straight? Actually J9 would have gutshot to K? Let me think: J9 would need K for straight? Board T T Q, so J9 needs 8 and K? No, T T Q, J9 would have 8-K straight? Actually 8 9 T J Q K - that's 6 cards. J9 needs 8 and K for straight, but board has T and Q, so J9 has gutshot to K (needs K for straight: 9 T J Q K). Yes, J9 has gutshot.\n\nActually better: KJ would have open-ended (needs A or 9). AJ would have gutshot to K.\n\nBut main concern is flush draw with two spades.\n\nI should bet around 16 chips (2/3 pot). That's a reasonable size.\n\nMy decision: raise to 24 (bet 16 into 24 pot). Actually wait: \"raise_to\" is total amount. I currently have 8 in (BB). So to bet 16, I would raise_to 24 (8 + 16).\n\nLet me think about checking instead: Could check-raise? But I'm not last to act - Seat 1 still to act after me. If I check, Seat 1 might bet, then I could check-raise. But Seat 1 might check behind. With trips, I want to build pot."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm in the small blind with Kd 5d. My stack is 340 chips (42.5 BB). Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 24 (3x BB). The pot is 36 chips, and I need to call 20 chips. The minimum raise would be to 40 total.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from Seat 2: I see they raised to 24 in hand #56 as well, then folded on a later street. They've shown pocket 44 in a showdown. They seem to be playing a mix of hands - sometimes calling, sometimes raising.\n\nMy hand: Kd 5d is suited, which gives some potential for flush draws. However, K5 suited is not a strong hand, especially from the small blind facing a raise. The king is good, but the 5 is a weak kicker.\n\nPosition considerations: I'm out of position for the rest of the hand, which is a significant disadvantage. I'll have to act first on every street after the flop.\n\nStack sizes: \n- I have 340 chips (42.5 BB)\n- Seat 2 has 239 chips (29.9 BB) - they have a shorter stack\n- Seat 5 (BB) has only 47 chips (5.9 BB) and will likely fold\n\nPot odds: I need to call 20 to win 56 (current pot of 36 + my call of 20). That's about 35.7% pot odds. K5s vs a typical raising range doesn't have 35% equity, especially out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (42.5 BB) and should avoid marginal situations out of position. Seat 2 has a shorter stack (29.9 BB), so they might be more aggressive.\n\nGiven all this:\n1. Hand strength is weak - K5s is not a hand I want to play for a raise, especially out of position\n2. Position is terrible (SB)\n3. Opponent seems to be raising with a reasonable range\n4. Pot odds aren't great for this hand\n5. Better to preserve my stack for better spots\n\nI should fold. This is a marginal hand that will be difficult to play post-flop out of position. The suitedness isn't enough to justify calling here.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K5s is too weak to call a raise from SB out of position.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I have 9s4d on the button. The action: Seat 5 posted SB 8, Seat 1 posted BB 16, Seat 2 folded. So it's on me with 16 to call.\n\nMy stack is 340 chips (21.2 BB). The BB is 16 chips, so I'm fairly deep. My hand is 9s4d - a very weak hand, unsuited, not connected. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\nHowever, let me consider the opponents:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has only 39 chips (2.4 BB) - extremely short stacked and already posted SB\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 313 chips (19.6 BB) in the BB\n\nFrom the history I saw:\n- GPT-OSS-120B is very short and might be desperate\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking seems to play somewhat tight based on the hands I saw\n\nThe pot is 24 chips (SB 8 + BB 16). If I call 16, the pot becomes 40. Then the short stack (GPT-OSS-120B) only has 31 chips left (39 - 8 SB = 31). They might go all-in with any two cards.\n\nBut my hand is terrible. Even against a short stack's random range, 94o is very weak. I'm on the button, which is good position, but with this hand it doesn't matter much.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 21.2 BB, which is a decent stack. I should preserve it for better spots. Calling with 94o is burning chips.\n\nLet me think about potential steals: If I raise, I could try to steal the blinds, but the BB has 19.6 BB and might defend. With 94o, I don't want to play a raised pot.\n\nActually, wait - the short stack only has 39 total, so 31 left after posting SB. They're almost certainly going all-in with any two if they decide to play. So if I call, I might face an all-in from them, and then the BB might call or raise.\n\nBetter to just fold and wait for a better spot. This hand is trash.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I've been playing somewhat tight, folding a lot. That's fine.\n\nSo my decision: fold.\n\nReasoning: 9s4d is a very weak hand, unsuited and not connected. With a short stack likely to shove any two, and the BB having a decent stack that might defend, this is not a good spot to enter the pot. Better to preserve my 21.2 BB stack for better opportunities.",

It's a suited hand but with low cards - J6 suited is not a strong starting hand from early position. \n\nMy stack: 340 chips (21.2 BB) - this is a medium stack in tournament terms. I need to preserve chips but also look for spots to accumulate.\n\nPosition: UTG (early position) - this is the worst position to play marginal hands from.\n\nOpponents: There are two Kimi-K2 players and a short-stacked GPT-OSS-120B with only 63 chips. The short stack might be looking to get all-in soon.\n\nGiven that I'm in early position with a weak hand, the standard play would be to fold. Playing J6 suited from UTG is generally not recommended as it can get me into trouble against players in later positions who can put pressure on me.\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to deviate from standard play. The short stack might be looking to shove, but I'm not in a position to capitalize on that from UTG. Also, with two other players to act behind me (including the short stack), I could easily face a raise.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 16 to win 24, which is 1.5:1 odds, but the hand itself is too weak to justify playing from this position.\n\nTournament considerations: With 21.2 BB, I'm not in desperate need to gamble with weak hands.

Called preflop this hand.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has been playing somewhat passively, checking and calling mostly.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in the BB and last to act on the flop. Both opponents checked to me.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWith 20BB, I'm not in dire need to accumulate chips urgently, but also not super deep.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe pot is 48 chips. I have a weak hand with some draw potential. Both opponents checked, suggesting weakness. I could:\n1. Check: Take a free card with my draws\n2. Bet: Try to steal the pot with a continuation bet\n\nGiven the board has an Ace, which often hits calling ranges, and my hand is weak, checking seems prudent. A bet would likely only fold out hands I beat, and get called or raised by better hands. My draws aren't strong enough to bet for protection.\n\nI should check and see the turn card. If I hit a Ten for the straight or a club for the flush draw, I can consider continuing.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Weak hand (J9o) on A-high board with only gutshot straight draw.

Actually, let me re-read: I'm Seat 3, I posted SB 8. Seat 1 posted BB 16. Seat 2 folded. So I'm in the small blind? Wait, the description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". But actions show \"Seat 3 post_sb 8\" and \"Seat 1 post_bb 16\". That seems contradictory. Let me think: There are 5 seats, but only 3 active players? Seats 4 and 5 have 0 chips and folded. So we have 3 players: Seat 1 (BB), Seat 2 folded, Seat 3 (me, SB). But it says my position is BB. Actually, maybe the positions are: Seat 1 is SB, Seat 2 is BB, Seat 3 is UTG? But Seat 2 folded. Hmm.\n\nLet me re-examine: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". \"Your Stack: 316 chips\". \"Blinds: 8/16\". \"Pot: 24 chips\". Actions: \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 8\" - that's me posting small blind. \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 16\" - Seat 1 posts big blind. \"preflop: Seat 2 fold\". So actually, I'm in SB, not BB. But the interface says BB. Could be a labeling issue. Anyway, the situation: I posted SB 8, Seat 1 posted BB 16, Seat 2 folded. So action is on me? Actually, after posting, action would normally be on UTG (Seat 2), but they folded. So now action is on me? I think yes: I'm in SB, I need to call 8 more to match BB of 16 total, or raise.\n\nAmount to call: 8. Minimum raise to: 32. Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nMy hand: 2s Ts. That's not great. Ten-deuce suited. In SB vs BB heads-up, this is a marginal hand. I have 316 chips (19.8 BB). Opponent (Seat 1) has 321 chips. This is a tournament, so stack preservation matters.\n\nI should consider opponent tendencies. Let me recall opponent actions.",

So it's heads-up between me (BB) and Seat 1 (BB). Actually wait: Seat 1 posted BB 16, I posted SB 8. Seat 2 folded. So I need to call 8 more to match the BB. So I'm facing a decision to complete the blind.\n\nMy hand: 2s Ts. This is a weak hand, but it's heads-up from the BB against a single opponent who just posted the BB. The opponent (Seat 1) has been playing somewhat tight recently - looking at the history: in hand 58 they raised preflop to 24, in hand 59 they called 8, in hand 60-62 they folded, in hand 63 they called 16. So they seem to be playing a mix.\n\nGiven this is heads-up and I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (I need to call 8 into a pot of 24), I should defend fairly wide. T2 suited is not great but it has some potential. I'm getting good odds. However, my stack is 316 chips (19.8 BB), which is short but not critical. The opponent has 321 chips.\n\nIn tournament play with 20BB stacks, I should be defending my BB fairly wide against a single limper. But wait, Seat 1 didn't limp - they just posted the BB. Actually the action: I posted SB 8, Seat 1 posted BB 16, Seat 2 folded. So Seat 1 hasn't taken any action yet - they just posted the blind. So I have the option to complete, raise, or fold.\n\nIf I complete, the pot will be 32 (8+16+8), and Seat 1 will have the option to check or raise. If I raise, I'd be raising from the BB against a player who just posted the BB.\n\nGiven T2 suited is weak, but I'm getting good pot odds to call. Raising seems too aggressive with this hand. Folding would be too tight given the pot odds.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been in similar spots.",

Blinds are 8/16. Pot is 24 chips. Only Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is in the hand besides me. Seat 2 folded. Amount to call is 8 (the difference between my SB of 8 and the BB of 16). Minimum raise to is 32 (double the current bet).\n\nMy hand is 2s Ts - not great, but suited connectors have some potential. I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (8 to call into 24 pot). I have position on the opponent (they're in BB, I'll act after them postflop).\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 19.8 BB, which is getting short but not critically short. Folding costs me nothing extra since I already put in 8 as SB. Calling 8 more completes to 16 total.\n\nWith suited connectors, I'm looking for flops that give me draws or strong hands. 2s Ts can make straights, flushes, or two pair. However, 2s is a weak card.\n\nGiven the pot odds (3:1) and the fact that I'm closing the action preflop (Seat 2 already folded), calling seems reasonable. Raising doesn't make sense with such a weak hand.\n\nWait, I should check if there are any opponent tendencies. But I need to respond with JSON now.\n\nDecision: call.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this river situation. I'm in the BB with 2s Ts, board is 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh. The river is Jh, completing the board. I have a pair of tens with a 2 kicker, so just a pair of tens. Actually wait, I have 2s Ts, board has 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh. My hand is 2s Ts. So I have a pair of tens with a 2 kicker. No flush possible for me (I have spades, board has clubs). There's a possible flush on board with clubs. The river Jh is a club? Wait board: 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh. The Jh is hearts, not clubs. So there are three clubs on board: 9c, 5c, 3c. So there's a possible flush with clubs.\n\nPot is 32 chips. My stack is 308 chips (19.2 BB). Opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 321 chips. I'm in BB, opponent is in SB? Wait positions: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (SB), Seat 2 is Kimi-K2 (folded), Seat 3 is me (BB). Actually preflop: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 8, Seat 1 post_bb 16. So I was SB? Wait I'm Seat 3, my position is BB. But blinds are 8/16. So SB posts 8, BB posts 16. I'm in BB, so I posted 16? Actually preflop actions: Seat 3 post_sb 8, Seat 1 post_bb 16, Seat 2 fold, Seat 3 call 8, Seat 1 check. That means I (Seat 3) posted SB 8, opponent (Seat 1) posted BB 16, then Seat 2 folded, then I called additional 8 to match BB, then opponent checked. So I started as SB, but effectively we're heads-up with me as SB and opponent as BB. But the hand says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Maybe mislabeled? Anyway.\n\nNow on river, action is on me. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise. I have a weak hand: pair of tens. The board is 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh. There's a straight possibility: 7-8 would make a straight, but board has 9-5-6-3-J. So possible straight: 7-8 makes a straight (5-6-7-8-9). Also 7-8 would be a straight. Also 4-7 would make a straight (3-4-5-6-7). So there are some straight possibilities. Also flush possible with clubs.\n\nMy hand is weak. I should probably check and see what opponent does. But I could consider a bluff raise if I think opponent will fold often. However, I need to understand opponent tendencies. Let me recall opponent actions.",

Opponent has shown tight tendencies, so a bluff might not work well.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the BB with 2s Ts on a board of 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh. The river just completed with Jh. The pot is 32 chips. I have 308 chips (19.2 BB). My opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking has 321 chips. We're heads-up after everyone else folded preflop. I posted SB 8, opponent posted BB 16, I called the additional 8 to complete. Both checked flop and turn. Now on river, amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand: 2s Ts. Board: 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh. I have Ten-high with no pair. The board shows 9,5,6,3,J with three clubs. I don't have a club. Best possible hand is Ten-high. This is a very weak hand - basically air.\n\nOpponent checked twice on flop and turn. They could have a weak hand too. The Jh on river might have hit some Jx hands, but they didn't bet flop or turn with any draws.\n\nLooking at opponent history: They've been fairly tight - folding preflop 4 times in recent hands, calling twice, raising once. On hand 63 (previous hand), they called BB preflop and bet 24 on flop. So they're capable of betting when they have something.\n\nGiven the board texture: 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh - there are straight draws (7-8, 4-7, 2-5), flush draws (clubs), and now J high. My opponent could have missed draws, weak pairs, or nothing.\n\nMy position: I'm out of position (BB vs SB). But since both checked all streets, this is likely going to a showdown if I check.\n\nIf I raise: Minimum raise to 16 (total). That would be a bet of 16 into 32 pot (50% pot). But with Ten-high, I'm bluffing. Would opponent call with worse? Possibly if they have nothing. But they might call with any pair.\n\nPot odds: If I bet 16, pot becomes 48, opponent needs to call 16 getting 3:1 odds. They'd call with any reasonable hand.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 19.2 BB, opponent has similar. Not desperate but not deep.\n\nGiven my weak hand and that opponent checked twice, they likely have a weak hand too. A bluff could work, but it's risky. Checking seems safer since I might win at showdown if opponent also has nothing.\n\nBut wait - I should think about what hands I'm representing. I called preflop from SB vs BB, which could be many hands. Checked flop and turn. Now river Jh. If I bet, I could represent a J, a flush, or a straight. But would I play those hands this way? Possibly check-calling or check-raising.\n\nActually, let me think: The board has 3 clubs. I don't have a club. If opponent has a club draw that missed, they'll fold to any bet. If they have a weak pair like 9x, 5x, 6x, 3x, they might call.\n\nGiven opponent's tight tendencies, they might fold weak hands to a bet. But they also might call with any pair.\n\nI think checking is better. I have showdown value of Ten-high, which might be best if opponent has 8-high or 7-high. A bluff risks 16 chips (0.5 BB) with moderate chance of success.\n\nLet me check my hand history: I won hand 59 with trip Tens. That's different.\n\nI'll check and hope my Ten-high is good. If opponent bets after I check, I'll have to decide based on bet size.\n\nActually, I should note: If I check and opponent bets, I'll likely fold since I have Ten-high. But if they check back, I might win.\n\nGiven pot is small (32 chips = 2 BB), not worth risking chips with a bluff.\n\nDecision: Check.",

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted SB 8, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted BB 16. No other players in the hand (Seats 4 and 5 folded).\n\nI need to decide preflop action. Amount to call is 16, minimum raise to 32.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, SB): Has been folding a lot preflop (hands 60, 61, 62 folded). Called once in hand 63 and checked through. Seems somewhat tight.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, BB): Has shown some aggression (raised to 24 in hand 60 preflop), but also calls and folds. Called a 47 chip bet in hand 62 preflop.\n\nMy hand: Pocket Tens is a strong hand, especially in position on the button. With only the blinds left to act, this is a good spot to raise.\n\nStack sizes: I have 19.2 BB, which is short but not critically short. The blinds have similar stacks (21.5 BB and 19.1 BB).\n\nTournament considerations: Need to accumulate chips. Pocket Tens is a premium hand in this situation.\n\nOptions:\n1. Call (16 chips): Not great - gives the blinds a cheap look at the flop with marginal hands.\n2. Raise: Standard play. I should raise to around 2.5-3x BB, which would be 40-48 chips.\n3. All-in: Too aggressive with pocket Tens when I have 19.2 BB.\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, a raise is correct. I'll raise to 48 chips (3x BB).\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns I should consider from the opponents. The BB (Kimi-K2) raised preflop in hand 60, so might be willing to defend. But pocket Tens should do well against their ranges.\n\nDecision: Raise to 48.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop situation with pocket tens (Th Td) from the button position. I have 308 chips (19.2 BB). The blinds are 8/16. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted the small blind of 8, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted the big blind of 16. I'm first to act preflop with only the blinds posted.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot preflop (folded hands 60, 61, 62), called once in hand 63, and checked from SB in hand 64. They seem somewhat tight.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown some aggression with a preflop raise in hand 60 to 24 (1.5x BB raise). They've called a few times and folded others.\n\nPocket tens is a strong hand, especially from the button. With only the blinds to act after me, I have position advantage. Standard play here would be to raise. The minimum raise is to 32 (double the big blind), but I should consider a larger raise.\n\nMy stack is 19.2 BB, which is getting short. In tournament play with this stack size, pocket tens is a premium hand that I want to get value from. I should raise to build the pot and potentially take it down preflop, or play a heads-up pot in position.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I've been folding a lot recently (hands 60-63 folded, hand 64 lost with weak hand). I need to accumulate chips. Pocket tens gives me a great opportunity.\n\nConsidering stack sizes: If I raise to around 48-64 (3-4x BB), that would be reasonable. But with my stack being 19.2 BB, I might consider a larger raise or even shove. However, shoving 19.2 BB with TT might be too aggressive when I can raise smaller and still have fold equity.\n\nThe blinds have 345 and 306 chips respectively (21.6 BB and 19.1 BB), so similar stacks. If I raise and get called, I'll have position postflop.\n\nI think raising to 48 (3x BB) is good. It builds the pot, gives me fold equity, and allows me to play postflop in position if called. If I get re-raised, I'd likely need to consider going all-in given my stack size.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns I should be aware of. Seat 2 raised preflop in hand 60 to 24 (1.5x BB), which is a small raise. So they might defend with a wide range.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: I'm on the button with pocket tens. This is one of the best situations in poker. I should definitely raise. The question is how much.\n\nWith 19.2 BB, a standard raise of 2.5-3x BB would be 40-48 chips. That leaves me with 260-268 chips behind (16.3-16.8 BB), which is still playable.\n\nI'll raise to 48 (3x BB). This is aggressive enough to get respect but not commit me too much.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 48,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket tens is a premium hand from button position.

          "content": "I need to respond with a JSON object. The user is telling me my format is invalid. I should provide my decision in the required JSON format. But first, I should think about the hand.\n\nI'm in the BB with A9o. My stack is 316 chips (19.8 BB). The opponent in Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 48 from what position? Looking at the players: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, Seat 2 is Kimi-K2 (folded), Seat 3 is me (DeepSeek-V3.2), Seat 4 and 5 are folded. So the action: Seat 2 posted SB 8, I posted BB 16, then Seat 1 raised to 48. Seat 2 folded. So it's heads-up between me and Seat 1.\n\nI need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise. I have A9o, which is a marginal hand. I'm out of position (BB vs raiser). The raise is to 48, which is 3x the BB (16). I need to call 32 more chips. My stack is 316, so calling would put me at 284. Pot is currently: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 48 = 72 chips. If I call, pot becomes 104. I'd be calling 32 to win 72, giving me pot odds of 2.25:1 (32/72). That's about 31% equity needed.\n\nA9o against a typical raising range from early position? Actually, Seat 1 is in what position? The table has 5 seats, but only seats 1-3 have chips. Seat 1 is the first to act preflop? Wait, typical order: SB (seat 2), BB (me, seat 3), then UTG (seat 4?), but seat 4 is folded with 0 chips. Actually, the players list shows seat 4 and 5 have 0 chips and folded. So Seat 1 is actually the button? Let's think: 5 seats, seat numbers: 1,2,3,4,5. Blinds: SB seat 2, BB seat 3. Then action goes to seat 4, then seat 5, then seat 1, then seat 2, then seat 3. But seat 4 and 5 folded (0 chips). So Seat 1 is the cutoff or maybe button? Actually with 5 seats, button would be seat 1? Let's calculate: If blinds are at seats 2 and 3, then button is seat 1. Yes, that makes sense. So Seat 1 is on the button. That's important: he's raising from the button, which is a much wider range.\n\nSo button raise vs BB. I'm in the big blind defending against a button steal. A9o is a decent defending hand. I should consider defending my blind. However, my stack is 19.8 BB, which is short but not desperate. The opponent has 297 chips (18.6 BB). We're both fairly short.\n\nI should recall opponent tendencies. But the system says I have invalid format. I need to make a decision without the tool results. But I can try to use tools while also outputting JSON? No, I need to output JSON. I could make a decision based on general principles.\n\nGiven it's a button raise, his range is wide: maybe 40-50% of hands. A9o has about 55% equity against a 50% range. Actually, A9o vs 50% range (random hands) has ~58% equity. So I have equity advantage. However, I'm out of position, which reduces my postflop edge.\n\nOptions: fold, call, raise. Raising could be good if I think he's stealing light. Minimum raise to 80. That would be a 3-bet to 80 total (64 more). That's a significant portion of my stack. If I raise to 80, I'd have 236 left, pot would be 144. He might 4-bet shove or call. If he calls, pot is 160, and I have 236 behind (about 1.5x pot). That's awkward.\n\nCalling seems reasonable: defend my blind with a decent ace, see a flop, and play postflop. But being out of position with A9o is tough.\n\nGiven stack sizes, maybe a call is best. I can check-raise flop if I hit. Or fold if I miss.\n\nI should consider tournament implications: we're both short-ish. Winning this pot would give me a boost.\n\nLet me check if I have any history. I'll try to use the tool quickly but need to output JSON. I'll make a decision.\n\nI think I'll call"

That's pot odds of 32/(72+32) = 32/104 = ~30.8%. \n\nLooking at opponent's actions: They've folded a lot preflop (10 out of 20 actions), but when they do play, they've raised once (hand 58), called twice (hands 59 and 63), checked twice (hands 57 and 64). Their raising range seems tight. In hand 58 they raised to 24 (1.5x BB) from early position. Here they raised to 48 (3x BB) from UTG.\n\nMy hand A9o is marginal against a UTG raise. Ace-rag offsuit doesn't play well against a likely tight range. I'm out of position for the entire hand. My stack is 19.8 BB, which is short but not desperate yet.\n\nThe pot odds are decent (30.8%), but I need to consider implied odds and reverse implied odds. With A9o, I could hit an ace and be dominated by better aces, or hit a 9 and be weak. Being out of position makes this worse.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 19.8 BB, opponent has 18.6 BB.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to make a decision in this poker hand. I'm on the button with Kc 6s, 284 chips (17.8 BB). Blinds are 8/16. Seat 1 posted SB 8, Seat 2 posted BB 16. I need to call 16 to play. Minimum raise to 32.\n\nFirst, let me think about my hand: K6 offsuit is a weak hand. Not great from any position, but being on the button is the best position. However, with only 17.8 BB, I'm getting short-stacked and need to consider pushing soon.\n\nLet me consider the opponents: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 513 chips, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 162 chips (about 10 BB). Seat 2 is in the big blind and is also short-stacked.\n\nWith K6o on the button, I could consider raising to steal the blinds, but K6o is really weak. However, with my stack size (17.8 BB), I should be looking for shove/fold spots. The standard shove range from button with 17.8 BB would be wider than K6o, but maybe not this wide.\n\nActually, let me think: With 17.8 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. On the button with two players left to act (SB and BB), I could consider shoving. The SB has 513 chips (32 BB), BB has 162 chips (10 BB). The BB is short and might call wider.\n\nBut K6o is really weak. The problem is if I shove and get called by either player, I'm likely dominated. The BB only has 10 BB, so he might call with a wide range.\n\nAlternatively, I could just call and see a flop, but K6o plays poorly postflop, especially with a short stack.\n\nLet me check if I have any information about opponents. I tried to use tools but got invalid format errors. I'll proceed without opponent data.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 16 to win 24, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. That's decent, but with such a weak hand, I'm not sure.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm at 17.8 BB, which is getting critical. I need to accumulate chips soon. But I also don't want to risk my stack on K6o.\n\nStandard play would be to fold K6o from any position, even button, with 17.8 BB. I should wait for a better spot.\n\nBut let me think about shoving: If I shove 284 into a pot of 24, that's a huge overbet. The SB would need to call 268 more to win 308, getting about 1.15:1 odds. The BB would need to call 268 more to win 308 (actually BB has only 162 total, so he'd be all-in for 162). So they need a decent hand to call.\n\nHowever, K6o has only about 40% equity against a random hand. If I get called, I'm likely behind.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. I have 17.8 BB, still enough for a few orbits.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nWe're in the BB with Qc Ah (Ace-Queen offsuit). Our stack is 268 chips (16.8 BB). Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has only 8 chips total according to the table info, but they just raised 154? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe table shows:\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips\n- But they raised 154 chips preflop\n\nThis is a contradiction. Either the stack display is wrong or there's something unusual. Actually, looking more carefully: Seat 2 posted SB 8, then raised 154. If they only have 8 chips total, they can't raise 154. So maybe the stack display is showing 8 chips as their remaining stack after posting SB? But they'd need at least 154+8=162 chips to make that raise.\n\nLet me check the pot size: 170 chips. That includes: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 154 - wait, that's 178, not 170. Actually, the pot is 170. Let me calculate: SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then Seat 2 raised to 154 total. So they put in 154 total, which means they added 146 more (since they already had 8 in as SB). So the pot should be: 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 146 (additional from raise) = 170. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo Seat 2 has at least 154 chips total. The \"8 chips\" display might be wrong or maybe it's showing something else.\n\nNow, Seat 2's actions: From the recall, they've mostly been folding. In hand 69 they raised to 48 preflop (from SB position against BB), then bet 80 on flop, then folded. They showed down with some weak hands: Tc 7d, 4d 4s, 5s Kc. So they play somewhat loose.\n\nWe have AQo, which is a strong hand, especially heads-up. We're in BB facing a raise from SB. The amount to call is 138, pot is 170, so pot odds are 138 to win 170+138=308, which is about 1:2.2, or we need ~31% equity.\n\nAQo vs a typical SB raising range has much better than 31% equity. Even against a tight range like 22+, A2s+, K9s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T9s, A9o+, KTo+, QTo+, JTo (top 25%), AQo has ~63% equity. Against a wider range, it's even better.\n\nOur stack is 268, we need to call 138, which is about half our stack. If we call, pot will be 308, and we'll have 130 left (8 BB). This creates a SPR of ~0.42, which means we're basically committed postflop.\n\nGiven our stack size (16.8 BB), we're in push/fold territory. With AQo, this is definitely a call (or all-in if raise was allowed, but only call/fold are legal).\n\nThe opponent has shown some aggression but also folds to pressure. They have a small stack relative to their raise? Actually, if they raised to 154 and we have 268, they might have us covered or be similar.\n\nTournament considerations: We need to accumulate chips. Folding here leaves us with 252 chips (15.75 BB), still playable but giving up a good hand. Calling gives us a chance to double up.\n\nGiven the pot odds and hand strength, I think we should call. We're getting good odds, and AQo is strong enough to continue.\n\nWait, but we only have \"fold\" and \"call\" as legal actions. No raise option. So we can't shove. We have to either call or fold.\n\nIf we call, we'll have 130 left (8 BB) going to flop with 308 in pot. We'll be pot committed on most flops. That's fine with AQo.\n\nI think call is correct. Let me check if there's any reason to fold... The opponent might have a premium hand, but even against KK+ or AK, AQo has ~25% equity, which is close to our pot odds requirement of 31%. Actually, against KK+ we have ~28%, against AK we have ~26%, against AA we have ~13%. But their range is wider than just premiums.\n\nGiven their history of showing down weak hands and occasional aggression, I think calling is +EV.\n\nLet me also consider: If we fold, we preserve 252 chips. If we call and lose, we're down to 130 ("

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nWe're in the BB with Qc Ah (Ace-Queen offsuit). Our stack is 268 chips (16.8 BB). Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has only 8 chips total according to the table info, but they just raised 154? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-examine:\n\nThe table shows:\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips\n- But they raised 154 chips preflop\n\nThis is a contradiction. Either the stack display is wrong or there's something unusual. Actually, looking more carefully: Seat 2 posted SB 8, then raised 154. If they only have 8 chips total, they can't raise 154. So maybe the stack display is showing 8 chips as their remaining stack after posting SB? But they'd need at least 154+8=162 chips to make that raise.\n\nLet me check the pot size: 170 chips. That includes: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 154 - wait, that's 178, not 170. Actually, the pot is 170. Let me calculate: SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then Seat 2 raised to 154 total. So they put in 154 total, which means they added 146 more (since they already had 8 in as SB). So the pot should be: 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 146 (additional from raise) = 170. Yes, that matches.\n\nSo Seat 2 has at least 154 chips total. The \"8 chips\" display might be wrong or maybe it's showing something else.\n\nNow, Seat 2's actions: From the recall, they've mostly been folding. In hand 69 they raised to 48 preflop (from SB position against BB), then bet 80 on flop, then folded. They showed down with some weak hands: Tc 7d, 4d 4s, 5s Kc. So they play somewhat loose.\n\nWe have AQo, which is a strong hand, especially heads-up. We're in BB facing a raise from SB. The amount to call is 138, pot is 170, so pot odds are 138 to win 170+138=308, which is about 1:2.2, or we need ~31% equity.\n\nAQo vs a typical SB raising range has much better than 31% equity. Even against a tight range like 22+, A2s+, K9s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T9s, A9o+, KTo+, QTo+, JTo (top 25%), AQo has ~63% equity. Against a wider range, it's even better.\n\nOur stack is 268, we need to call 138, which is about half our stack. If we call, pot will be 308, and we'll have 130 left (8 BB). This creates a SPR of ~0.42, which means we're basically committed postflop.\n\nGiven our stack size (16.8 BB), we're in push/fold territory. With AQo, this is definitely a call (or all-in if raise was allowed, but only call/fold are legal).\n\nThe opponent has shown some aggression but also folds to pressure. They have a small stack relative to their raise? Actually, if they raised to 154 and we have 268, they might have us covered or be similar.\n\nTournament considerations: We need to accumulate chips. Folding here leaves us with 252 chips (15.75 BB), still playable but giving up a good hand. Calling gives us a chance to double up.\n\nGiven the pot odds and hand strength, I think we should call. We're getting good odds, and AQo is strong enough to continue.\n\nWait, but we only have \"fold\" and \"call\" as legal actions. No raise option. So we can't shove. We have to either call or fold.\n\nIf we call, we'll have 130 left (8 BB) going to flop with 308 in pot. We'll be pot committed on most flops. That's fine with AQo.\n\nI think call is correct. Let me check if there's any reason to fold... The opponent might have a premium hand, but even against KK+ or AK, AQo has ~25% equity, which is close to our pot odds requirement of 31%. Actually, against KK+ we have ~28%, against AK we have ~26%, against AA we have ~13%. But their range is wider than just premiums.\n\nGiven their history of showing down weak hands and occasional aggression, I think calling is +EV.\n\nLet me also consider: If we fold, we preserve 252 chips. If we call and lose, we're down to 130 (",

          "content": "I need to make a decision for this hand. I'm in the BB with Qc Ah, board is Jd Tc Js. My stack is 130 chips (8.1 BB). Pot is 308 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) is the only other player, with just 8 chips total. They posted SB 8, raised to 154 preflop, and I called 138. Now on the flop, they checked. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or fold. Legal actions are fold or check.\n\nWait, Seat 2 only has 8 chips total? Let me check the player list again: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips. That seems odd since they raised to 154 preflop. Maybe they went all-in? Actually, if they only had 8 chips, they couldn't raise to 154. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips\" - that must be their current stack after the preflop action. They started with more, raised all-in to 154, and now have 8 chips left? No, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nActually, looking at the preflop action: \"Seat 2 post_sb 8\" then \"Seat 2 raise 154\". If they only had 8 chips total, they couldn't raise to 154. Maybe the 8 chips is a mistake or there's something I'm missing. Let me think: Pot is 308 chips. Blinds are 8/16. I posted BB 16. Seat 2 posted SB 8, then raised to 154. That's a raise of 146 more (8+146=154). I called 138 more (16+138=154). So total pot: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 154 + call 138 = 316? Actually: SB 8, BB 16, Seat 2 raises to 154 total (adds 146), I call 138 more. So pot = 8 + 16 + 154 + 138 = 316. But it says pot is 308. Close enough, maybe rounding.\n\nBut Seat 2's stack shows 8 chips. That might be their remaining stack after the raise? If they had 162 chips total (154+8), raised to 154, leaving 8. That makes sense. So Seat 2 has only 8 chips left, effectively all-in on any further betting. They checked because they have no more chips to bet? Actually, they can still bet their remaining 8 chips. But minimum raise would be to 138, which they can't do. They could bet 8 though. But they checked.\n\nI have Qc Ah on Jd Tc Js board. That's Ace-high with a gutshot straight draw (need a King for Broadway). Also backdoor flush potential with Qc Ah (clubs). Actually, I have Qc and Ah, so only one club. No flush draw. But I have overcards (Ace) and gutshot to Broadway (K gives A-K-Q-J-T). Also possible straight with Q-9? No, that's not a straight. I need a King for nut straight.\n\nOpponent has 8 chips left. They raised preflop and then checked flop. They could have a wide range: pairs, broadway cards, maybe suited connectors. With two jacks on board, trips are possible but less likely. They might have missed with AK, AQ, etc. Or they could have a jack.\n\nPot is 308, I have 130 chips total. If I bet, I could try to win the pot now. But opponent only has 8 chips left, so they're essentially all-in for any bet. If I bet, they'll likely call with any piece. But if I check, we see turn and river for free (since they have no chips to bet).\n\nMy hand has decent equity against many hands. Against a jack, I have about 25% equity (gutshot). Against an overpair like QQ-AA, I have less. Against AK, AQ, KQ, etc., I have good equity. Against a ten, I'm behind but have outs.\n\nGiven opponent only has 8 chips left, and pot is 308, I'm getting huge pot odds. I should probably check and see a free turn, then decide. If I hit my King on turn, I can bet (though they only have 8 chips). If I miss, I can check again and see river for free.\n\nActually, wait: if I check, and turn comes, they might bet their last 8 chips if they improve. But they only have 8 chips, so risk is minimal. Checking seems best to realize my equity for free.\n\nBut also consider: I could bet small to try to"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to make a decision for this hand. I'm in the BB with Qc Ah, board is Jd Tc Js. My stack is 130 chips (8.1 BB). Pot is 308 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) is the only other player, with just 8 chips total. They posted SB 8, raised to 154 preflop, and I called 138. Now on the flop, they checked. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or fold. Legal actions are fold or check.\n\nWait, Seat 2 only has 8 chips total? Let me check the player list again: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips. That seems odd since they raised to 154 preflop. Maybe they went all-in? Actually, if they only had 8 chips, they couldn't raise to 154. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips\" - that must be their current stack after the preflop action. They started with more, raised all-in to 154, and now have 8 chips left? No, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nActually, looking at the preflop action: \"Seat 2 post_sb 8\" then \"Seat 2 raise 154\". If they only had 8 chips total, they couldn't raise to 154. Maybe the 8 chips is a mistake or there's something I'm missing. Let me think: Pot is 308 chips. Blinds are 8/16. I posted BB 16. Seat 2 posted SB 8, then raised to 154. That's a raise of 146 more (8+146=154). I called 138 more (16+138=154). So total pot: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 154 + call 138 = 316? Actually: SB 8, BB 16, Seat 2 raises to 154 total (adds 146), I call 138 more. So pot = 8 + 16 + 154 + 138 = 316. But it says pot is 308. Close enough, maybe rounding.\n\nBut Seat 2's stack shows 8 chips. That might be their remaining stack after the raise? If they had 162 chips total (154+8), raised to 154, leaving 8. That makes sense. So Seat 2 has only 8 chips left, effectively all-in on any further betting. They checked because they have no more chips to bet? Actually, they can still bet their remaining 8 chips. But minimum raise would be to 138, which they can't do. They could bet 8 though. But they checked.\n\nI have Qc Ah on Jd Tc Js board. That's Ace-high with a gutshot straight draw (need a King for Broadway). Also backdoor flush potential with Qc Ah (clubs). Actually, I have Qc and Ah, so only one club. No flush draw. But I have overcards (Ace) and gutshot to Broadway (K gives A-K-Q-J-T). Also possible straight with Q-9? No, that's not a straight. I need a King for nut straight.\n\nOpponent has 8 chips left. They raised preflop and then checked flop. They could have a wide range: pairs, broadway cards, maybe suited connectors. With two jacks on board, trips are possible but less likely. They might have missed with AK, AQ, etc. Or they could have a jack.\n\nPot is 308, I have 130 chips total. If I bet, I could try to win the pot now. But opponent only has 8 chips left, so they're essentially all-in for any bet. If I bet, they'll likely call with any piece. But if I check, we see turn and river for free (since they have no chips to bet).\n\nMy hand has decent equity against many hands. Against a jack, I have about 25% equity (gutshot). Against an overpair like QQ-AA, I have less. Against AK, AQ, KQ, etc., I have good equity. Against a ten, I'm behind but have outs.\n\nGiven opponent only has 8 chips left, and pot is 308, I'm getting huge pot odds. I should probably check and see a free turn, then decide. If I hit my King on turn, I can bet (though they only have 8 chips). If I miss, I can check again and see river for free.\n\nActually, wait: if I check, and turn comes, they might bet their last 8 chips if they improve. But they only have 8 chips, so risk is minimal. Checking seems best to realize my equity for free.\n\nBut also consider: I could bet small to try to",

Wait, that seems odd - Seat 2 has 8 chips according to the table, but they raised preflop to 154. Let me check: Seat 2 posted SB of 8, then raised to 154 total? Actually, preflop actions: Seat 2 post_sb 8, Seat 3 (me) post_bb 16, Seat 1 fold, Seat 2 raise 154, Seat 3 call 138. So Seat 2 raised to 154 total, putting in 146 more (8 SB + 146 raise). They had 8 chips to start? That doesn't add up. Maybe they had more and lost some? Or the 8 chips is what they have left after the raise? Let me think: If they started with 8 chips, they couldn't raise to 154. So the 8 chips must be their remaining stack after the raise. That makes sense: they raised all-in or near all-in, leaving 8 chips behind. Actually wait, they raised to 154, I called 138 (since I already had 16 in BB). So pot is 308 (154+154). Now on turn, opponent has 8 chips left. They checked. I have 130 chips total, but 16 already in from BB, so I have 114 left? Actually my stack is 130 chips total. I put in 16 preflop as BB, then called 138 more, so that's 154 total invested. 130-154 = -24? That can't be right. Let me recalculate: My stack is 130 chips. Preflop: I post BB 16, leaving 114. Then I call 138 more? That would put me at -24. That's impossible. Maybe the 130 is my stack after the call? Actually, the display says \"Your Stack: 130 chips (8.1 BB)\". That's my current stack, not starting stack. So I started with more, invested 154, and now have 130 left. That means I started with 284 chips. That makes sense. Opponent started with 162 chips (154 raise + 8 left). They're almost all-in.\n\nNow the turn: board is Jd Tc Js 5h. I have Qc Ah. That's AQ offsuit. Board has JJT5 with two hearts? Actually Jd, Tc, Js, 5h - so one heart (5h). I have no hearts. My hand: Ah is a heart, but board has 5h, so I have Ace-high with queen kicker, no pair. I have a gutshot straight draw: I need a king for Broadway straight (A-K-Q-J-T). That's 4 outs. Also backdoor flush draw? No, I have Ah but only one heart on board. Actually Ah is a heart, board has 5h, so two hearts. That's not a flush draw yet (need 3). So basically I have Ace-high with gutshot to Broadway. Pot is 308, opponent has 8 chips left. They checked. I can check or bet. Minimum raise to is 138, but I can't raise because \"raise\" is not in legal actions - only fold or check. So I can only check or fold. Folding would be absurd with a free card. I should check to see a free river, or maybe bet small to try to get the last 8 chips? But betting would require at least a min-raise of 138, which is huge relative to pot and my stack.

With a jack, they might check to trap. With TT, they have a full house now (TT on JJ board). With AJ, they have trips. With AA, KK, QQ, they have overpair but board has trips.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with JSON. Let me think: I'm in BB with AQ offsuit on Jd Tc Js 5h board. Pot is 308. Opponent has 8 chips left and checked. My legal actions are fold or check. Folding is terrible - I get to see a free river card. I should check. But wait, could there be a reason to fold? No, that's insane. I check. So action is \"check\", raise_to null. Reasoning: I have Ace-high with gutshot straight draw, pot is large, opponent has only 8 chips behind and checked, so I check to see a free river card. Might improve to Broadway straight. Folding would be terrible with a free card.\n\nBut let me double-check: Is there any scenario where folding is correct? Maybe if I think opponent has a full house and I have zero equity? But I have 4 outs to Broadway straight (any king). That's about 8.7% equity (4/46). Actually turn to river, 4 outs out of 46 unknown cards = 8.7%. Pot is 308, and if I check, I see river for free. If I bet, I'd have to put in at least 138 which is huge. But I can't bet anyway - only check or fold. So definitely check.\n\nWait, but could I technically \"fold\" to avoid putting more chips in later? No, there's no more betting unless opponent bets their last 8 chips on river. But I can call 8 chips if they bet river. That's trivial relative to pot. So check.\n\nThus JSON: {\"action\": \"check\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"Check to see free river with Ace-high and gutshot straight draw. Opponent has only 8 chips remaining and checked, so taking free card is optimal. Folding would be terrible with potential equity.\"}\n\nBut let me make sure about the stack sizes. Opponent has 8 chips. If they bet 8 on river, pot becomes 316, I have to call 8 to win 316, that's 40:1 odds. I'd call with any piece. So check now.",

Then flop, turn, and river were all checked.\n- Current situation: River, opponent checked, I can check or fold (no raise option since I need to raise to at least 138, which is more than my stack of 130).\n\nKey points:\n1. Opponent has only 8 chips left (0.5 BB) - they're essentially all-in already\n2. The board: Jd Tc Js 5h 6c - paired jacks, no flush possible\n3. My hand: AQ high with Qc Ah - no pair, just Ace-high with queen kicker\n4. Opponent's preflop raise was huge (154 chips when they only had 8 chips to start with? Wait, let me check the action again)\n\nActually, looking at the preflop action: \"Seat 2 raise 154\" but Seat 2 only had 8 chips? That doesn't make sense unless they had more chips earlier. Let me check the stack sizes: Seat 2 has 8 chips now, but they raised 154 preflop? That would mean they were all-in preflop. Actually, looking at the action: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 154\" and then \"preflop: Seat 3 call 138\". So opponent raised to 154 total, I called 138 more (since I already had 16 as BB). So opponent had at least 154 chips preflop? But now they have 8 chips left... Wait, maybe the 8 chips is what's left after the all-in? Actually, if they had 154 chips and went all-in preflop, they'd have 0 left. But they have 8 chips. Something is inconsistent.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's stack: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 8 chips\". So they have 8 chips left. That means they didn't go all-in preflop with 154? Or maybe the raise amount is the total they put in, not additional? Let me think: They posted SB of 8, then raised to 154 total. So they put in 146 more (154 total - 8 SB). They had 8 chips left after that? That would mean they started with 154+8=162 chips. Now they have 8 chips left after putting in 154. That makes sense.\n\nBut wait, the pot is 308 chips. Let me calculate: My BB 16 + opponent's 154 = 170. That's not 308. Oh, there were other players who folded? Actually, Seat 1 folded, Seats 4 and 5 have 0 chips (folded). So pot should be 16 (my BB) + 154 (opponent) = 170. But pot is 308. That suggests there were antes or something? Or maybe my math is wrong.\n\nActually, looking at the action: \"preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 8\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 16\". So SB posted 8, BB posted 16. Then opponent raised to 154 total. So opponent put in 146 more (154-8). I called 138 more (154-16). So pot = 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 146 (opponent raise) + 138 (my call) = 308. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo opponent has 8 chips left after putting in 154. They started with 162 chips (154+8).\n\nNow the river: Board is Jd Tc Js 5h 6c. Opponent checked. I have AQ high. What could opponent have?\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 actions were folds). In hand #69, they raised preflop (48), then bet flop (80), then folded. So they can be aggressive but also fold to pressure.\n\nGiven they raised preflop big (154), they likely have a strong hand. But then they checked flop, turn, and river. That suggests they missed or have a medium-strength hand. With paired j"

That means they put in 154 total, which includes their SB 8. So they added 146 more. But their stack is shown as 8 chips now. That suggests they had 154 chips before posting? Actually, maybe the stack display is current stack after actions. After raising 154, they would have 0 left if they started with 162? Wait, they posted SB 8, then raised to 154 total.

Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo opponent has 8 chips left after putting in 154. They started with 162 chips (154+8).\n\nNow the river: Board is Jd Tc Js 5h 6c. Opponent checked. I have AQ high. What could opponent have?\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 actions were folds). In hand #69, they raised preflop (48), then bet flop (80), then folded. So they can be aggressive but also fold to pressure.\n\nGiven they raised preflop big (154), they likely have a strong hand. But then they checked flop, turn, and river. That suggests they missed or have a medium-strength hand. With paired j",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with JSON. Let me think about the situation:\n\n- Board: Jd Tc Js 5h 6c (paired jacks, no flush possible)\n- My hand: Qc Ah (Ace-high with queen kicker)\n- Opponent checked river\n- I can check or fold\n- Pot is 308 chips\n- Opponent has 8 chips left (essentially irrelevant for betting)\n\nMy hand is weak - just Ace-high. But the board is J-T-J-5-6. What hands could opponent have? They raised preflop big, then checked all streets. Could be AK, AQ (like me), maybe TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA. But if they had JJ (full house), would they check all streets? Possibly slow-playing. TT would be trips. But they checked flop with top pair? Unlikely.\n\nActually, with paired board, many hands missed. My AQ high might be best. Opponent might have missed with KQ, Q9, etc. Or they might have a weak pair like 99, 88.\n\nBut they only have 8 chips left - they can't bet anyway. So checking seems best. I shouldn't fold when it's free to see showdown.\n\nWait, I can only check or fold. Folding would be terrible when it costs nothing to see showdown. I should check.\n\nBut let me think about tournament implications: I have 130 chips (8.1 BB). If I lose this pot, I'll be down to... Actually, I already put in 154 chips? Wait, I put in 16 (BB) + 138 (call) = 154. I have 130 chips left. So if I lose, I'll still have 130 chips? No, the pot is separate. I've already invested 154. My stack is 130. So I'm playing for the 308 pot.\n\nActually, I need to be careful. If I check and lose, I still have 130 chips. If I fold... why would I fold when it's free? That makes no sense.\n\nSo I should check. But wait, could there be a reason to fold? Maybe if I'm certain I'm beat and want to avoid showing my cards? But in tournament, information has some value, but not worth folding when it's free.\n\nActually, I just realized: the opponent has 8 chips left. After this hand, they'll be almost out. I have them covered.\n\nLet me check: I have AQ high. On J-T-J-5-6 board, what beats me? Any pair beats me. So if opponent has any pair, I lose. But they checked all streets. Would they check with a pair? Possibly if it's a weak pair like 55, 66, or maybe they have JJ (full house) and are slow-playing. But more likely they have missed overcards like AK, AQ, KQ.\n\nActually, they raised preflop big. Typical range: 77+, AJ+, KQ maybe. On J-T-J flop, AJ would have top pair, would probably bet. JJ would have full house, might check. TT would have trips, might check. 99-77 would have underpair, might check. AK, AQ, KQ missed, would check.\n\nSo it's close. But since it costs nothing to check, I should check.\n\nActually, wait: I just re-read. The opponent is \"Kimi-K2\" in seat 2. But there's also \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\" in seat 1 who folded. Two Kimi-K2s? That's odd. Maybe it's a bot or something. But anyway.\n\nI should check. Let me respond.",

Seat 2 raised to 48 total, so I need to call 40 more chips. Minimum raise would be to 80 total.\n\nFirst, I should consider my position and hand strength. KTs is a decent hand, but not premium. I'm in the small blind, which is a bad position postflop. My stack is short at 7.6 BB, so I'm in push/fold territory.\n\nI need to understand Seat 2's raising tendencies. But the system is not letting me use tools without proper JSON response. Let me just make a decision based on basic poker principles.\n\nWith 7.6 BB, KTs is definitely in my shoving range from the small blind. However, there's already a raise from Seat 2. Seat 2 raised to 48 (3x BB). I have 122 chips total, so if I call 40, I'll have 82 left (5.1 BB) in a pot of 112. That's committing a lot of my stack.\n\nAlternatively, I could shove all-in for 122 total. That would be a raise to 122, which is legal since minimum raise is 80. \n\nPot odds: I need to call 40 to win 112 (72 pot + 40 my call). That's about 36% equity needed. KTs vs a typical raising range probably has around 35-45% equity depending on how tight Seat 2 is.\n\nGiven my short stack and the fact that I'm in push/fold territory, and KTs plays well multi-way but I'm out of position... Actually, with the big blind still to act behind me (Seat 1), that's a concern. If I call, BB might squeeze.\n\nGiven my stack size, I think the best play is to either shove or fold. Calling leaves me with an awkward stack. KTs is strong enough to shove against a single raiser with my stack size.\n\nLet me check if I can recall any information about Seat 2... Oh wait, I need to respond with JSON. Let me just make a decision. I'll go all-in. KTs has good equity against many hands, and with my stack size, it's time to take a stand.

My stack is only 8 chips (0.5 BB), which is confusing because earlier it says my stack is 8 chips but blinds are 8/16. Actually wait, I posted SB of 8 chips preflop, and then raised to 122? That seems impossible with only 8 chips stack. Let me re-read.\n\nHand says: \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" but then preflop actions show: \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 8\" (that's me), \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 16\", \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 48\", \"preflop: Seat 3 raise 122\", \"preflop: Seat 1 fold\", \"preflop: Seat 2 call 74\".\n\nIf I only have 8 chips, how can I raise to 122? That doesn't make sense. Maybe the stack display is wrong or there's a misunderstanding. Let me check the pot size: 260 chips. Let's calculate: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 48 + my raise 122 + call 74? Actually need to calculate properly.\n\nSeat 1 (BB) posted 16, Seat 2 raised to 48 total (so added 32 more), then I raised to 122 total (so added 114 more from my SB of 8? Actually I posted SB 8, then raised to 122 means I put in 114 more). Then Seat 1 folded BB, Seat 2 called 74 more (to match 122). So pot should be: SB 8 + BB 16 + Seat 2's initial 48 + my raise to 122 (but I only had 8? hmm) + Seat 2's call 74 = 268? Actually let's compute: BB 16 + Seat 2's raise 48 = 64. Then my raise to 122 adds 122-8 (since I already posted 8) = 114. So pot now 64+114=178. Then Seat 2 calls 74 more (122-48=74). Total pot 178+74=252. But displayed pot is 260. Close but off by 8.\n\nAnyway, the key point: I have only 8 chips left? But I already put in 122? That can't be right. Maybe the stack display is my current stack after posting SB and raising? Actually if I had 130 chips total, posted SB 8, then raised to 122 total, that would leave me with 130-122=8 chips. That makes sense! So I started with 130 chips, posted SB 8, then raised to 122 total (putting in 114 more), leaving me with 8 chips behind. Yes, that's it.\n\nSo now on the flop, I have 8 chips left, board is 9h 8d 5c, my hand is Kc Ts. I have a gutshot straight draw: need a J for a straight (T-J? Actually K T on board 9 8 5, I need a J for a straight: J would give me J T 9 8 7? Wait, I have K T, board 9 8 5. A J gives me J T 9 8 K - that's not a straight. Actually I need a Q for a straight: Q J T 9 8? That's not consecutive. Let's check: With K T, board 9 8 5, possible straights: I need J Q for a straight? K Q J T 9? That's king-high straight. Actually yes, if a Q and J come, I have K Q J T 9. But that's two cards. Or if a 7 comes, I have T 9 8 7 5? That's not a straight. Actually T 9 8 7 6 would be straight, but I have K T. So I have a gutshot to a straight if a J comes? Wait: J would give me J T 9 8 5 - that's not a straight. I need a J and a Q for a straight. So I have no straight draw. I have two overcards: K and T vs board 9 8 5. So I have two overcards, but the board is low and connected. My hand is not great.\n\nI'm heads-up against Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) who has 242 chips.

Actually if he bets, I'll have to call any bet since I only have 8 chips. So I should check and hope to see turn and river. Folding would be terrible since I have only 8 chips and pot is 260 - I should at least see if I improve.\n\nBut wait, I can fold now? Yes, legal actions include fold. But folding when there's no bet and I have only 8 chips left would be insane. I should check and hope to hit a K or T. Or maybe even bluff if I think opponent will fold? But with 8 chips, I can't really bluff.\n\nActually, I should check. If opponent bets, I'll call with any two cards getting 260:8 odds, which is 32.5:1. I need only about 3% equity to call. My K high probably has at least 20% equity against a random hand. So check-call is correct.\n\nBut wait, I have position? Actually I'm BB, so I act first on flop. I check, then opponent acts.

The hand says \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" but blinds are 8/16. Actually, looking at preflop actions: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 8, Seat 1 post_bb 16, Seat 2 raise 48, Seat 3 raise 122, Seat 1 fold, Seat 2 call 74. That means I raised to 122 total? But my stack is only 8 chips? Something doesn't add up.\n\nLet me re-read: \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" but I posted SB of 8 chips. If I only have 8 chips total, I would be all-in with my SB. But the preflop action shows I raised to 122. That suggests my stack might be larger than 8 chips, or there's a mistake.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: 334 chips. Let's calculate: Preflop: SB 8 + BB 16 + Seat 2 raise 48 + my raise to 122 + Seat 2 call 74. That's 8+16+48+122+74 = 268. But pot is 334, so there's 66 more somewhere. Maybe there were antes or something.\n\nBut more importantly: I have only 8 chips left? That would mean I'm effectively all-in preflop. But the flop action shows I checked and Seat 2 bet 74. If I only have 8 chips, I can't have any more to bet. The amount to call is 74, but I only have 8 chips total.\n\nWait, maybe \"Your Stack: 8 chips\" is incorrect or it means I have 8 chips remaining after the preflop action? Let me think: If I started with more chips, raised to 122, and now have 8 left, that means I started with 130 chips. That makes sense: 130 total, put in 122 preflop, leaving 8 behind. Yes! That must be it. So I have 8 chips left, and the bet is 74 to call. I can only call my remaining 8 chips.\n\nBut the legal actions are \"fold, call\" - no raise option. So I can either fold or call 74, but since I only have 8 chips, I can only call 8 chips (all-in). Actually, in poker, if a player doesn't have enough to call a full bet, they can go all-in for their remaining chips. So calling would put in my last 8 chips.\n\nLet me check the board: 9h 8d 5c. My hand: Kc Ts. I have King-high with a gutshot straight draw? Actually, T-9-8-7... I need a 7 or J for a straight. I have a gutshot to a J (J gives me J-T-9-8-7? Wait, board is 9-8-5, I have K-T. A J gives me J-T-9-8-5, which is a straight? Actually J-T-9-8-5 is not a straight; need 7 for a straight. Let me think: For a straight, I need Q-J or 7-6. Actually, with T and board 9-8-5, I need a 7 to make T-9-8-7-5 straight, or a J to make J-T-9-8-5? That's not a straight. Actually J-T-9-8-5 is J high, not a straight. So I have no straight draw. I have overcards (K high) and a backdoor flush draw? Kc and board has no clubs yet. Actually 5c is a club, so I have Kc and board has 5c, giving me a backdoor club flush draw. But not much.\n\nMy hand is weak. I'm basically drawing to a King or Ten. But I only have 8 chips left, and the pot is 334 chips. If I call 8 chips (all-in), I'm getting huge pot odds: 334:8 = about 41:1. Even with a weak hand, those odds are hard to pass up. I need only about 2.4% equity to break even. Even King-high probably has at least 10-15% equity against a range.\n\nBut I should consider opponent's range. Seat 2 is Kimi-K2 with 168 chips. They raised preflop to 48, called my 3-bet to 122. What range would call a 3-bet? Probably"

Wait, actually the actions show: Seat 1 post_sb 8, Seat 2 post_bb 16. Then it says \"Amount to call: 16\". That means I need to call 16 to see the flop? But I'm on the button, so there's no one else to act? Let's think: Positions: Seat 1 is SB, Seat 2 is BB, I'm BTN. Seat 4 and 5 are folded. So it's folded to me on the button. The blinds are already posted. So I can either fold, call 16 (limping), or raise. Minimum raise to 32 total (so raise by 16 more). \n\nMy hand is J4 offsuit, not great.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 4h Js - This is a weak offsuit hand. J4o is not a good starting hand, especially from the button. It has very little potential for making strong hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is a good position, but with such a weak hand, position alone doesn't justify playing.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 260 chips (16.2 BB) - This is a short stack. At 16BB, I need to be selective about my hands and look for good spots to accumulate chips.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has raised preflop 12 times in 77 hands, showing some aggression. Recently raised to 40 and 48 chips.\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop 19 times, showing even more aggression. Recently made a huge 154-chip raise in hand 72 (with KK), and has been raising to 40-48 chips frequently.\n\n5. **Current situation**: Both opponents are still to act after me. Seat 1 posted SB (8), Seat 2 posted BB (16). I need to call 16 chips to see a flop.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With only 16.2 BB, I need to preserve my stack and pick better spots. J4o is not a hand worth risking chips with, especially when both opponents behind me have shown aggression and could easily raise.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I'd need to call 16 into a pot of 24, getting 1.5:1 odds. But with such a weak hand and potential for raises behind me, these odds aren't good enough.\n\nGiven all this, folding is the clear choice. I should wait for a better hand to play, especially with my short stack. The risk of getting raised behind me or playing a weak hand out of position post-flop makes this an easy fold.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"J4o is too weak to play with 16.2 BB stack.

Looking at their recent actions, they've been folding a lot recently (hands 74-77), but they did raise in hand 71 preflop and made a big raise on the flop in hand 69. They have 449 chips vs my 244 (15.2 BB).\n\nThe pot is 40 chips (SB 8 + BB 16 + limp 16). I have position on them since I'm BB and they're UTG/MP? Actually, Seat 1 is first to act after blinds? Wait, let me check: Seat 2 posted SB, I posted BB, Seat 1 called, Seat 2 folded. So I'm last to act preflop with position on the limper.\n\nI have Q2 suited, which is very weak. In the BB with position against a limper, I could consider raising to try to take it down preflop, but Q2s is really weak even for that. My stack is 244 (15.2 BB) which is short but not desperate. The opponent has been folding a lot recently, so they might be playing tight.\n\nHowever, looking at their showdowns: they had KK in hand 9 (premium), T5o in hand 57 (weak), and A4s in hand 64 (speculative). So they're playing some weak hands too.\n\nGiven my position and the fact that I can check for free, I should probably just check and see a flop. Q2s has some flush potential but is otherwise weak. Raising would be risky with such a weak hand, and if called, I'll be out of position postflop (actually no, I have position since I'm BB and they limped? Wait, after the flop, action starts with the first player after the button. The button is Seat 5? Actually need to think about positions...).\n\nBetter to check and see a cheap flop. If I hit something good, I can continue. If not, I can fold. No need to risk chips with Q2s.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. Tournament stage: we're at 8/16 blinds, I have 15.2 BB, which is short but not critically short. The opponent has more chips.\n\nDecision: Check and see a flop.",

The pot is 40 chips, and it's my action with amount to call = 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 1 has been folding a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop). They raised on the flop in hand 69 with 200 chips, and in hand 73 they called preflop and then checked on the flop. They have shown some aggression but also caution.\n\nMy hand: bottom pair with backdoor draws. This is a marginal hand. I'm out of position (BB vs BTN? Actually seat 1 is UTG? Let me check positions: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat 2 was SB, seat 3 is me BB, seat 4 and 5 folded. So seat 1 is UTG? Actually with 5 players, positions would be: seat 1 UTG, seat 2 SB, seat 3 BB, seat 4 BTN? Wait the order is seat 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But seat 4 and 5 folded. So seat 1 acted first preflop and called. That suggests seat 1 might be in early position.\n\nI have 244 chips (15.2 BB). The opponent has 449 chips (28 BB). The pot is 40 chips.\n\nGiven I have bottom pair with a weak kicker, but some draw potential, and I'm out of position, checking seems reasonable. I could consider a small bet to try to take it down now, but with bottom pair and weak draw, I'd rather check and see what the opponent does. If they bet, I might call with my pair and draw odds.\n\nThe board is 6d 9c 2s - fairly dry with no obvious straight draws. My hand has some showdown value but is vulnerable.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with Qd 2d. Board is 6d 9c 2s. I have bottom pair with a weak kicker (queen), but I do have a backdoor flush draw with the diamond. The pot is 72 chips, opponent bet 32. I have 244 chips total (15.2 BB). Opponent has 417 chips.\n\nFrom the opponent history, I see that Kimi-K2 Thinking has been fairly active preflop with raises and calls, but has folded a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop). On the flop in hand 69, they raised 200 (which was likely a big bet). In hand 73, they called preflop, checked flop, then folded to a bet.\n\nMy hand: bottom pair with weak kicker. The board is dry (6d 9c 2s). I hit a pair of 2s, but there are overcards possible. The bet is 32 into 72, which is about 44% pot. This is a standard continuation bet size.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 32 to win 104 (72 + 32). That's about 31% pot odds. My equity: I have 5 outs to improve (three 2s, two queens, though queens might not be clean). Plus backdoor flush draw gives maybe 2 more outs. Roughly 7 outs = ~28% equity on flop. This is close to the pot odds.\n\nHowever, implied odds are poor because my hand is weak and I'm out of position. If I call and turn improves me, I might not get paid. Also, if opponent has a better hand (overpair, 9x, 6x, etc.), I could be drawing nearly dead.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 15 BB, which is getting short but not desperate. Folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\nOpponent tendencies: They've shown aggression on flop before (hand 69 raised 200). They could be betting with a wide range here after limping preflop.\n\nGiven my weak hand, out of position, and marginal pot odds, I think folding is correct. The backdoor flush draw and bottom pair aren't enough to continue here. Let me check if there are any other factors.",

Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe Seat 2 had chips when they raised? Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\" - maybe they're out of the hand? But the action says they raised. Could be a display issue. Regardless, I'm facing a raise to 234 total, and I need to call 226 more (since I already put in 8). My stack is 236, so calling would be all-in.\n\nI have 9h4d offsuit, one of the worst possible hands. I'm in the small blind. The raiser is Seat 2, who appears to have 0 chips?

Seat 1 (SB) posted 8, Seat 2 (BB) posted 16. I need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been mostly folding preflop, but called a few times. Showdown hands include KK, T5, A4. Seems to play somewhat tight.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): More aggressive, has raised preflop multiple times. Showdown hands include Tc7d, 44, 5sKc, KK, TdQc. Has shown willingness to play speculative hands.\n\nI'm on the button, which is the best position. With 8T offsuit, this is a marginal hand. At 14.8 BB, I'm getting short-stacked and should be looking for opportunities to accumulate chips. However, 8T offsuit is quite weak.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 16 to win 24 (8+16). That's 1:1.5 pot odds, or 40% equity needed. 8T offsuit doesn't have 40% equity against random hands.\n\nTournament considerations: With 14.8 BB, I'm getting into push/fold territory. I should be looking for better spots. The button position is tempting, but the hand is too weak.\n\nLooking at legal actions: I can fold, call, or raise. Raising would be to at least 32 total.\n\nGiven the hand strength and stack size, folding seems correct. I should wait for a better spot. Seat 2 in the BB might defend wide, but with 8T offsuit, I'm likely dominated.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been playing too tight.",

I should try to get some information about their play.\n\nActually, I realize I need to respond with JSON. But I should think first. With 14.8 BB, I'm getting short-stacked. I need to find spots to accumulate chips. 8c Td is not a great hand, but position helps. The blinds have already posted, so there's 24 in the pot. Calling 16 gives me pot odds of 24:16 or 1.5:1, which means I need about 40% equity.\n\nActually, I should check if raising is better. A small raise might get the blinds to fold. But with such a weak hand, if I get called or raised, I'm in trouble.\n\nGiven my short stack (14.8 BB), I should be looking for better spots. 8c Td offsuit is not a hand I want to play for 7% of my stack.

Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted SB 16, I posted BB 32, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called 32, then Seat 2 raised to 250 total (which means they raised 234 more from their SB position). Seat 2 only has 16 chips total? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check: Seat 2 has 16 chips, but they raised to 250? That would be impossible if they only have 16 chips. Actually, looking at the action: Seat 2 post_sb 16, then Seat 2 raise 250. But they only have 16 chips total? That seems contradictory. Maybe the stack sizes are before posting blinds? Or perhaps Seat 2 is all-in with their 16 chips? But the raise amount is 250, which is more than their stack. Let me re-read.\n\nPlayers at table:\nSeat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 433 chips\nSeat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\nSeat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 204 chips\n\nSeat 2 has 16 chips. They posted SB 16, so they're essentially all-in with their SB. Then they \"raise 250\"? That can't be right. Maybe the \"raise 250\" is the total amount they put in? But they only have 16 chips. Perhaps the system shows the total bet amount, not the additional? If they have 16 chips and posted SB 16, they can't raise more. Unless they're allowed to raise all-in for less than min raise? But the minimum raise to is 468, which is huge.\n\nWait, let me calculate: Pot is 314 chips. Amount to call is 218. Minimum raise to is 468. My stack is 204, so I can't even call the 218 - I only have 204 total! Actually, I have 204 chips total, and I already posted BB of 32, so I have 172 left. To call 218 more, I'd need to put in 218, but I only have 172 left. So I'm effectively all-in if I call. The amount to call is 218, but my remaining stack is 172. So I can call all-in for 172.\n\nLet me verify: My stack: 204 chips. I posted BB 32, so remaining stack: 172. Amount to call: 218. So I can call all-in for 172. That would put me all-in.\n\nSeat 2 has 16 chips. They posted SB 16, so they're all-in. Seat 1 has 433 chips and called 32 initially. Now facing Seat 2's raise... but Seat 2 only has 16 chips, so their raise can only be for their remaining 0? Something is off.\n\nMaybe the stack sizes are after posting blinds? Let me think: Seat 2 started with 16 chips, posted SB 16, now has 0. Their \"raise 250\" might be a misprint, or maybe it's the total pot? Actually, looking at the action: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 250\". That could mean they raised to 250 total. But they only have 16 chips. Unless the stack size shown is before posting? If Seat 2 had 266 chips, posted SB 16, now has 250, and raised to 250 total (i.e., put in 234 more). That would make sense: they have 250 after posting SB? But the listing says 16 chips. Hmm.\n\nLet me check my memory tools to understand opponent tendencies and past hands. I'll search for similar situations.",

Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted SB 16, I posted BB 32, Seat 1 called 32, then Seat 2 raised to 250 total. Amount to call is 218, but my entire stack is only 204 chips. So I can only call 204 (all-in). Minimum raise to is 468, but I can't afford that.\n\nWait, let me check: Seat 2's raise: they posted SB 16, then raised to 250 total. That means they put in 234 more (250 total - 16 already). The amount to call for me is 218 (250 - my BB 32). But my stack is 204, so I can only call 204, which puts me all-in.\n\nI have Ac Ks, a premium hand. Seat 2 has only 16 chips? Actually they posted SB 16, then raised to 250. But their stack is listed as 16 chips. That seems contradictory. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\". But they posted SB 16, then raised to 250. That would require 234 more chips, but they only have 16 total? Something's off. Maybe the stack listing is at start of hand? Or maybe Seat 2 has 16 chips after posting SB? Actually if they had 16 chips, posted SB 16, they'd be all-in for the SB. But they raised to 250, which is impossible if they only have 16 chips.\n\nPerhaps the stack listing is current stack after actions? Let me think: Seat 2 started with some amount, posted SB 16, then raised. The raise to 250 might be all-in if they had less than 250. But the listing shows 16 chips. That might be their remaining stack after the raise? If they raised to 250 all-in, and had 266 total? Not sure.\n\nAnyway, I have AK suited (Ac Ks). This is a very strong hand, especially with my short stack of 6.4 BB. I'm facing a raise from Seat 2 who is in the SB. Seat 1 called initially but then Seat 2 raised. Seat 1 might call or fold.\n\nWith AK and only 6.4 BB, I should almost always go all-in. Even if Seat 2 has a premium pair, AK has good equity. And I'm getting pot odds: pot is 314 currently, I need to call 204 all-in. That's pot odds of 314:204, or about 1.54:1. I need about 39% equity to call. AK vs any pair except AA or KK has at least 45% equity. AK vs AA has 7%, vs KK has 30%. But vs random range, AK is strong.\n\nGiven my short stack, I should definitely go all-in. But wait, I can only call, not raise, because \"raise\" is not in legal actions. Legal actions are fold, call. So I can only call all-in (204 chips) or fold.\n\nI should call.

Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has only 16 chips and just raised 250? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check: Seat 2 has 16 chips total, posted SB of 16, so they're all-in. They raised 250 but only have 16? Actually, looking at the actions: Seat 2 post_sb 16, then Seat 3 (me) post_bb 32, Seat 1 call 32, then Seat 2 raise 250. But Seat 2 only has 16 chips total. This seems like a misrepresentation. Maybe Seat 2 has more chips? The table says Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips. So they have 16 chips total. They posted SB 16, so they're all-in. The raise to 250 is impossible. Perhaps it's a bug or the raise is actually all-in? The amount to call is 218, which is huge relative to my stack of 204. Actually, I have 204 chips total. I've already posted BB of 32, so I have 172 left. Amount to call is 218, but I only have 172 left? That doesn't add up. Let me calculate: My stack: 204 chips. I posted BB 32, so I have 172 left. Amount to call: 218. That means I need to put in 218 more, but I only have 172. So I would be all-in if I call. The minimum raise to 468 is impossible for me. So my options are fold or call all-in.\n\nBut wait, Seat 2 only has 16 chips. How can the amount to call be 218? Let me reconstruct: Pot is 314 chips. Blinds 16/32. Seat 2 (SB) posts 16. I (BB) post 32. Seat 1 calls 32. Then Seat 2 raises. But Seat 2 only has 16 total, so they can only raise to 16 total? Actually, they already put in 16 as SB, so they have 0 left. They can't raise. Something is off.\n\nMaybe the chip counts are wrong. Let me check the players: Seat 1 has 433, Seat 2 has 16, Seat 3 (me) 204, Seat 4 and 5 have 0 and folded. So Seat 2 indeed has only 16. Their raise of 250 must be a mistake. Perhaps the raise is actually all-in for their remaining stack? But they have no remaining stack after posting SB. Unless the chip count is after posting? They had 16, posted SB 16, now have 0. So they can't raise.\n\nI think there's a data error. But I need to make a decision. I have AKo, a premium hand. I'm facing a raise from a very short stack (16 chips). Actually, if Seat 2 has 16 total, and they raised, the maximum they can put in is 16. So the amount to call should be small. But the UI says amount to call: 218. That suggests Seat 2 actually has more chips. Maybe the chip count displayed is wrong. Let me use tools to recall opponent actions.",

They raised to 250, but they only have 16 chips, so this is essentially an all-in for their remaining stack.\n\nSeat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called 32 preflop. The pot is 314 chips. I need to call 218 chips to match Seat 2's all-in.\n\nMy stack is 204 chips, so if I call, I'd be all-in for my entire stack.\n\nLooking at Seat 2's past raises: they've raised with various hands including KK, K5, Q10, 44, etc. Their most recent raise (hand 79) was 234 chips. They seem to be an active raiser.\n\nI have AcKs, which is a premium hand. Against a short stack all-in of 16 chips, this is an easy call. But wait, I need to call 218 chips, not 16. Actually, Seat 2 only has 16 chips total, so their raise to 250 is essentially an all-in for their remaining 16 chips. The pot is 314, and I need to call 218.

Then Seat 2 raised to 250, but they only have 16 chips total. So their effective raise is just their remaining 16 chips. The main pot would be: SB 16 + BB 32 + call 32 + all-in 16 = 96 chips. Then there would be a side pot between me and Seat 1.\n\nBut wait, I have 204 chips total. If I call, I'd be putting in 218 total (my 32 BB plus 186 more).

I'm in the BB with 8c 9h, facing a BB post of 32 chips, but I already posted SB 16, so I need to call 16 more to complete the BB. I have 188 chips total (5.9 BB). The opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 401 chips. Only one opponent left since others folded. I'm in BB, opponent is in SB? Wait, seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat 3 is me. Seat 1 posted BB 32, I posted SB 16. Actually, I'm seat 3, I posted SB 16. Seat 1 posted BB 32. Seat 2 folded. So I'm in SB, not BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\" but actions show \"Seat 3 post_sb 16\". That seems contradictory. Maybe I'm BB but posted SB? Let me check: blinds are 16/32. SB is 16, BB is 32. I'm seat 3, posted SB 16. So I'm SB, not BB. But it says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Might be a mistake. Anyway, I need to call 16 more to complete the BB? Actually, I already posted SB 16, and now it's my action to call 16 more to match the BB? Wait, the BB is 32 posted by seat 1. I'm SB, I posted 16, so I need to put in 16 more to match BB if I want to play. Amount to call: 16. Yes.\n\nMy hand is 8c 9h, offsuit, not great. I have 188 chips (5.9 BB). Opponent has 401 chips. I'm in SB with a marginal hand. In tournament poker with short stack, I should consider pushing or folding. 8-9 offsuit is not great but can play in some spots. With only 5.9 BB, I might consider shoving if I think opponent will fold often. But opponent is in BB with 401 chips (12.5 BB). They might call with a wide range because they have me covered. However, I need to consider tournament survival. Folding leaves me with 172 chips (5.4 BB). Calling 16 more leaves me with 172 as well? Actually, if I call, I put in 16 more, total 32 in pot, stack becomes 156 (4.9 BB). Then play postflop out of position with a weak hand. Not ideal.\n\nMaybe I should shove? Legal actions: fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to: 64. That's double the BB? Actually, amount to call is 16, minimum raise is to 64 total? That means raise additional 48? Wait, I need to calculate: current bet is 32 (BB). I have put in 16. To raise, I need to raise to at least 64 total. That would be putting 48 more (64 total - 16 already). That's a raise of 32 over the BB? Actually, standard raise is at least double the previous bet. Previous bet is 32 (BB), so minimum raise is to 64. Yes.\n\nIf I shove, that's raise to 188 total. That's a significant overbet. Might get folds from weak hands. But with 8-9 offsuit, I'm not thrilled. However, with 5.9 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Typically, with less than 10 BB, you should either shove or fold preflop. My hand is not strong enough to open-shove from SB? Actually, I'm not opening; I'm facing the BB's bet. Wait, no: the BB posted blind, not a bet. It's my action to complete, raise, or fold. So I can complete (call 16), raise, or fold.\n\nGiven my short stack, completing with 8-9o out of position is bad. I should either shove or fold. Let me think about opponent tendencies. I don't have info yet. But I can assume they're a reasonable player. They might call a shove with a decent range because they have me covered and I'm short. But with 5.9 BB, they might call wider. However, they might fold hands like weak aces, small pairs, etc. 8-9o has some equity against calling range.\n\nPot odds: If I shove 188 total, pot would be 48 (current) + 172 (my additional) = 220? Wait, I already have 16 in. If I shove, I put 172 more (188 total). Opp"

I've already posted the SB of 16, and the BB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted 32. Seat 2 folded, so it's heads-up between me and Kimi-K2 Thinking. I need to call 16 to complete the blind.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding a lot preflop (6 out of 8 hands they could have acted), called twice (once with 16, once with 32). They seem somewhat tight. In hand 78, they called 16 preflop and then bet 32 on the flop. In hand 81, they called 32 preflop and then folded to a raise.\n\nMy hand: 8c9h is not great, but it's suited connectors (well, 8-9 offsuit actually - I misread, it's 8c9h so offsuit). Still, it can make straights and pairs. In a heads-up situation from the BB, I'm getting good pot odds: pot is 48, I need to call 16, so 3:1 pot odds. That's a good price.\n\nMy stack is short (5.9 BB). This could be a spot to push all-in if I think I have fold equity. But looking at opponent tendencies, they've been folding a lot preflop. However, they're in the BB and already have 32 invested. If I raise, minimum raise is to 64 total (32 more). But my stack is only 188, so I could go all-in.\n\nConsiderations: With 5.9 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. 89o is not a premium hand, but it's not terrible for a short stack shove. The opponent has shown some willingness to call (twice), but also folds a lot. If I shove, they need to call 156 more (their 32 already in, my 188 total - they'd need to put in 156 more). That's a significant commitment.\n\nPot if I shove: current pot 48 + my 188 = 236 total. They'd need to call 156 to win 236, getting about 1.5:1 odds. They'd need around 40% equity to call. Most hands have better than 40% equity against 89o, so they might call with a wide range.\n\nBut maybe they'll fold many hands. Given they've folded 6/8 times preflop, they might fold again.\n\nAlternatively, I could just complete and see a flop. With 3:1 pot odds, calling 16 is fine. But then I'll be out of position with a mediocre hand.\n\nGiven my short stack, I think shoving has merit. Let me check my own hand history to see how I've been playing.",

I'm in the BB with 8c 9h, facing a BB post of 32 chips, but I already posted SB 16, so I need to call 16 more to complete the BB. I have 188 chips total (5.9 BB). The opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 401 chips. Only one opponent left since others folded. I'm in BB, opponent is in SB? Wait, seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat 3 is me. Seat 1 posted BB 32, I posted SB 16. Actually, I'm seat 3, I posted SB 16. Seat 1 posted BB 32. Seat 2 folded. So I'm in SB, not BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\" but actions show \"Seat 3 post_sb 16\". That seems contradictory. Maybe I'm BB but posted SB? Let me check: blinds are 16/32. SB is 16, BB is 32. I'm seat 3, posted SB 16. So I'm SB, not BB. But it says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Might be a mistake. Anyway, I need to call 16 more to complete the BB? Actually, I already posted SB 16, and now it's my action to call 16 more to match the BB? Wait, the BB is 32 posted by seat 1. I'm SB, I posted 16, so I need to put in 16 more to match BB if I want to play. Amount to call: 16. Yes.\n\nMy hand is 8c 9h, offsuit, not great. I have 188 chips (5.9 BB). Opponent has 401 chips. I'm in SB with a marginal hand. In tournament poker with short stack, I should consider pushing or folding. 8-9 offsuit is not great but can play in some spots. With only 5.9 BB, I might consider shoving if I think opponent will fold often. But opponent is in BB with 401 chips (12.5 BB). They might call with a wide range because they have me covered. However, I need to consider tournament survival. Folding leaves me with 172 chips (5.4 BB). Calling 16 more leaves me with 172 as well? Actually, if I call, I put in 16 more, total 32 in pot, stack becomes 156 (4.9 BB). Then play postflop out of position with a weak hand. Not ideal.\n\nMaybe I should shove? Legal actions: fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to: 64. That's double the BB? Actually, amount to call is 16, minimum raise is to 64 total? That means raise additional 48? Wait, I need to calculate: current bet is 32 (BB). I have put in 16. To raise, I need to raise to at least 64 total. That would be putting 48 more (64 total - 16 already). That's a raise of 32 over the BB? Actually, standard raise is at least double the previous bet. Previous bet is 32 (BB), so minimum raise is to 64. Yes.\n\nIf I shove, that's raise to 188 total. That's a significant overbet. Might get folds from weak hands. But with 8-9 offsuit, I'm not thrilled. However, with 5.9 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Typically, with less than 10 BB, you should either shove or fold preflop. My hand is not strong enough to open-shove from SB? Actually, I'm not opening; I'm facing the BB's bet. Wait, no: the BB posted blind, not a bet. It's my action to complete, raise, or fold. So I can complete (call 16), raise, or fold.\n\nGiven my short stack, completing with 8-9o out of position is bad. I should either shove or fold. Let me think about opponent tendencies. I don't have info yet. But I can assume they're a reasonable player. They might call a shove with a decent range because they have me covered and I'm short. But with 5.9 BB, they might call wider. However, they might fold hands like weak aces, small pairs, etc. 8-9o has some equity against calling range.\n\nPot odds: If I shove 188 total, pot would be 48 (current) + 172 (my additional) = 220? Wait, I already have 16 in. If I shove, I put 172 more (188 total). Opp",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to output a JSON decision. Let me think: I'm in SB with 8c9h, 5.9 BB stack. Facing BB blind. Options: fold, call 16, or raise. With this stack size and marginal hand, best is likely fold. Calling is bad because I'll be out of position with weak hand and short stack. Raising small is pointless; if I raise, I should shove. But is 8-9o good enough to shove? In tournament short stack, shoving range from SB vs BB might include hands like any two cards above certain threshold. 8-9o is not great but has some playability. However, with only 5.9 BB, I might want to wait for a better spot. But blinds are 16/32, so next hand I'll be BB and have to post 32, leaving me with 156 if I fold now (172 - 32 = 140? Wait, I have 188 now. If I fold, I have 172 left (since I already posted 16). Next hand I'm BB, post 32, leaving 140 (4.4 BB). That's even worse. So I'm in a tough spot. Maybe I should shove now with any two cards? Let's consider ICM implications. It's a tournament, but early? Not sure. I think shoving might be better than folding because folding leaves me with 4.4 BB next hand. Shoving now with 8-9o might have decent equity. I need to estimate opponent's calling range. If they call with top 30% of hands, my equity is maybe 35%. Pot odds: if I shove 172 more, total pot if they call: 48 current + 172 my shove + 156 their call? Wait, they have to call 156 more (188 total - 32 they already posted). Actually, they posted BB 32. If I shove to 188, they need to call 156 more. Pot would be 48 + 172 + 156 = 376. I'm investing 172 to win 376, need 31.4% equity. If they call with top 30%, my equity is about 36% against that range (rough estimate). So it's slightly +EV. But if they call wider, my equity goes up. If they call tighter, my equity goes down but they fold more often. Actually, if they fold often, that's good. So shoving might be profitable.\n\nBut I need to be cautious. Let's see if I have any info on opponent. I can't use tools because I need to output JSON. The user said \"Invalid response format\" when I tried to call tools. So I must decide without tool use. I'll assume opponent is typical. With 5.9 BB, standard push/fold charts say from SB vs BB, with 6 BB, you can shove with a wide range including 89o. Yes, I think shove is correct.\n\nI'll shove all-in. Raise_to should be 188 (my total stack). Let's output JSON.",

I need to make a decision based on the information I have.\n\nLet me analyze: I'm on the button with K9o, 7.4 BB stack. Everyone has folded to me. SB and BB are also relatively short (12 BB and 9.3 BB). \n\nWith K9o, this is a marginal situation. In tournament poker with short stacks, we often use push-fold charts. From BTN position with 7.4 BB, K9o is typically in the shoving range against two short-stacked players in SB and BB. \n\nThe pot is 48 chips, I need to call 32. If I shove for 236 total, that's a significant overbet (7.4x the BB), but it might get folds from the blinds who are also short and don't want to risk their tournament life with marginal hands.\n\nHowever, K9o is not a premium hand. It's dominated by many hands that might call (any Ace, any King with better kicker, pairs). \n\nActually, let me think about tournament strategy. With 7.4 BB, I'm in push-or-fold territory. On the button, I should be shoving a wide range to steal the blinds. K9o is probably near the bottom of that range, but might still be profitable.\n\nBut wait, I should consider that the blinds are also short. They might be more likely to call with wider ranges since they're also at risk. \n\nActually, I think folding might be better here. K9o is weak, and with 7.4 BB, I still have some room to wait for a better spot. I'm not in immediate danger of blinding out.\n\nI think I should fold and wait for a better hand.",

Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 378. But wait, Seat 2 shows 0 chips and is marked \"(out)\"? Actually the table shows Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out). Yet the action says Seat 2 raise 378. That seems contradictory. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\" but then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 378\". Maybe Seat 2 went all-in with 0 chips? Or maybe it's a display issue. Actually, looking at the pot size: pot is 426 chips. Let's calculate: SB 16 + BB 32 = 48. If Seat 2 raised to 378, that's a raise of 346 over the BB? Wait, BB is 32, so raise to 378 means they put in 378 total? Actually \"raise 378\" likely means they raised the amount to 378 total. But they have 0 chips? This is confusing.\n\nLet me check the stack sizes: Seat 1 has 401 chips. Seat 2 has 0 chips (out). I have 140 chips. So Seat 2 is already out? Maybe they folded earlier? But the action says they raised. Possibly a bug in display. However, the amount to call is 362. My stack is 140 chips. I can't call 362 with only 140 chips. Actually, I can only call up to my stack of 140. The amount to call is 362, but I have 140. So I can go all-in for 140. But the legal actions are only \"fold, call\". No raise option. So I can call all-in for my remaining 140.\n\nWait, let's think: I posted SB 16, so I have 124 left? Actually my stack is 140 chips total. I posted SB 16, so I have 124 behind. But the amount to call is 362, which is more than my stack. So I can call all-in for my remaining 124? Actually I already put 16 in, so to call the raise, I need to match the total bet of 378. I have 124 left, so I can call all-in for 124, making my total contribution 140. But the raise was to 378, so if I call all-in for 124, I'm not matching the full bet. However, in poker, if a player goes all-in for less than the full bet, it's a side pot situation.\n\nBut let's recalculate: Pot is 426 chips. How did it get to 426? SB 16 + BB 32 = 48. Then Seat 2 raised to 378. That adds 378 - 32 = 346 more? Actually BB put in 32, so raise to 378 means Seat 2 puts 378 total, which is 346 more than BB. So pot = 16 (SB) + 32 (BB) + 378 (Seat 2) = 426. Yes.\n\nNow I need to call 362 to match the 378 total? Actually I already put 16, so I need to add 362 to make my total 378. But I only have 124 left. So I can call all-in for 124, making my total 140. That creates a main pot of: my 140 + BB 32? Wait, BB already put 32, but they haven't acted yet? Actually Seat 1 (BB) still needs to act. They have 401 chips.\n\nSo the situation: Seat 2 raised to 378. I have 140 total stack. I can call all-in for my remaining 124. Then Seat 1 (BB) can act.\n\nMy hand: As Qc.

Their stack is 16 chips total? That seems odd. Let me check: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips. They posted SB 16, then raised 222. But they only have 16 chips total? That can't be right. Maybe they have 16 BB? No, the blinds are 16/32, so 16 chips is 0.5 BB. Actually, looking at the stack sizes: Seat 2 has 16 chips, that's half a BB. They posted SB 16, which is their entire stack. Then they raised 222? That doesn't make sense - they can't raise more than their stack. Let me re-read: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 222\". But their stack is 16. Maybe it's a misprint? Or maybe they went all-in with their remaining 0? Actually, if they posted SB 16 and have 16 total, they have 0 left. But they raised 222? That's impossible.\n\nWait, maybe the stack sizes are in BB? Let's check: \"Your Stack: 280 chips (8.8 BB)\". So chips are actual chips, not BB. Blinds are 16/32 chips. So Seat 2 has 16 chips total. They posted SB 16, using all their chips. Then they raised 222? That can't be. Unless the raise amount is total put in? Let's think: SB posts 16. Then they raise to 222 total? That would mean they put in 206 more, but they only have 0 left. Hmm.\n\nMaybe the \"raise 222\" is the total amount they have put in? Like they went all-in for their remaining stack? But they only had 16 total, so after posting SB 16, they have 0 left. So any raise would be 0 additional. But it says \"raise 222\". That seems like a mistake.\n\nLet me look at the pot size: Pot: 254 chips. How is that calculated? SB posted 16, BB posted 32, and Seat 2 raised 222? That would be 16+32+222 = 270, not 254. Actually, maybe the raise amount is the additional amount on top of the BB? Let's calculate: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. Then SB raises to 222 total? That would mean SB puts in 222 total, which is 206 more than the 16 they already posted. But they only have 16 total stack, so they can't put 206 more.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me check the amount to call: 190. If SB raised to 222 total, then as BB I have already put in 32, so I need to call 190 more to make my total 222. That matches: 222 - 32 = 190. So SB's total bet is 222. Their stack is 16 chips, but they raised to 222? That means they're all-in for their entire stack of 16? Wait, but 222 is much larger than 16. Unless the stack size listed is wrong.\n\nMaybe Seat 2 actually has 222 chips? Let's look: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\". That's clear. But maybe it's 16 BB? No, it says chips. And my stack is 280 chips (8.8 BB), so 280/8.8 = ~31.8 chips per BB. Actually, blinds are 16/32, so BB is 32 chips. 280/32 = 8.75 BB, which matches 8.8 BB. So chips are actual chips.\n\nSeat 2 has 16 chips, which is 0.5 BB. They posted SB of 16, which is all their chips. Then they raised to 222 total? That's impossible. Unless the raise is from someone else? Let's check actions: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 222\". That's definitely Seat 2.\n\nI think there might be an error in the data. But I need to make a decision anyway. I have Q8 suited in hearts. Facing a raise to 222 total, with 190 to call. My stack is 280. If I call, I'll have 90 left (280 - 190 = 90). Pot would be 254 + 190 = 444? Actually, let's calculate pot: Currently pot is 254. If I call 190, that adds 190, making pot 444. Then we'd go to flop with effective stack of 90 behind (if"

If I call, I'll have 90 left. The opponent has 16 chips total? That seems wrong. But based on the info: SB has 16 chips, posted SB 16, then raised to 222 total. That means they're all-in with their 16 chips? But the raise amount doesn't match. Actually, if they have 16 chips and posted SB 16, they have 0 left. Any raise would be 0 additional. But the system says \"raise 222\". Maybe it's a bug or the stack size is misreported.\n\nLet me think strategically: Q8 suited is not a great hand. I'm getting pot odds: need to call 190 to win 254+190=444? Actually, pot is 254, opponent put in 222 total? I need to call 190 more. So pot would be 254+190=444 if I call. My call is 190, so pot odds are 190:254 \u2248 1:1.34, or about 43% equity needed. Q8 suited vs a random hand has about 40% equity. Against a raising range from SB (even short-stacked), it's worse. But if opponent is literally all-in with 16 chips, then the raise is tiny. But the numbers don't match.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\". Then \"preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 16\". So they used all 16 chips for SB. Then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 222\". That can't be right. Unless \"raise 222\" means they raised the pot by 222? Or it's a total amount? Actually, in poker notation, \"raise 222\" usually means they raised to 222 total. But with 16 chip stack, impossible.\n\nMaybe the stack is wrong. Let me check other seats: Seat 1 has 385, folded. Seat 3 (me) 280. Seat 4,5 have 0 and folded. So only SB and me. SB has 16 chips. They posted SB 16. So they're all-in with their SB. The raise must be their all-in for remaining 0. But it says \"raise 222\". Could be a display error.\n\nGiven the confusion, I should make a decision based on reasonable assumptions. Q8 suited is marginal. Facing a raise, even from a short stack, I should probably fold. But let's calculate: If SB is all-in for 16 chips total, then after posting SB 16, they have 0. So the \"raise\" is actually just completing their blind? No, they already posted SB. Maybe they're going all-in with 0 additional? That would mean I need to call 0 more? But it says \"Amount to call: 190\". So that doesn't match.\n\nI think there's a data error. But I have to decide. With Q8 suited and 190 to call into 254 pot, getting about 1.34:1 odds, needing ~43% equity. Q8 suited vs a reasonable SB raising range has less than 43% equity. Against a very wide range maybe 40%. Close, but probably fold. Also, I have only 280 chips (8.8 BB). Calling 190 leaves me with 90 (2.8 BB). If I lose, I'm crippled. If I win, I have 280+254=534? Actually, if I call and win, I get the 254 pot plus my 190 back? No, I get the pot. Pot is 254, I add 190, total 444. If I win, I get 444, net gain 254. My stack would be 280+254=534. If I lose, I have 90 left.\n\nBut actually, the opponent only has 16 chips. So the most I can win from them is 16? Wait, they put in 16 as SB. The pot has 32 from blinds (16+32=48). Plus maybe other dead money? Pot is 254, which includes what? SB 16, BB 32, plus 206 from somewhere? There must be other money. Seat 1 folded but maybe they had antes? No.\n\nActually, let me read: \"Pot: 254 chips\". How? Blinds: 16/32. SB posts 16, BB posts 32. That's 48. Where's the other 206 from? Maybe there are antes? Not mentioned. Or maybe previous action?

Against a raising range from SB (even a short stack), it's worse. The SB only has 16 chips according to display, but raised to 222. This doesn't make sense. Possibly the stack size is wrong and SB has more chips. Or maybe the raise amount is wrong.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 8.8 BB. Calling 190 leaves me with 90 (2.8 BB) if I lose. That's very short. Q8 suited is not a hand worth risking my tournament life with marginal odds.\n\nI should fold. Even if SB is bluffing with a wide range, Q8 suited is weak.

Seat 2 folded. I posted SB 16, so I need to call 16 more to match the BB.\n\nThis is essentially a heads-up situation between me (BB) and Seat 1 (BB). Actually wait: Seat 1 is in the BB?

That seems contradictory. Let me re-read:\n\n\"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 16\" - I posted SB 16\n\"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 32\" - Seat 1 posted BB 32\n\nBut it says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Hmm, maybe the positions are mislabeled? Or maybe it's showing I'm BB but I posted SB? Actually in tournaments, sometimes positions rotate. Let me think: If I'm BB, I should post 32.

Blinds are 16/32. Seat 1 posted SB 16, Seat 2 posted BB 32. Amount to call is 32. Minimum raise to 64. Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nThis is a tournament situation with very short stacks. I have 8.2 BB. ATo on the button is a strong hand in this situation. With both blinds having posted, I'm last to act preflop. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 385 chips (12 BB), Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 238 chips (7.4 BB).\n\nGiven my stack size, I should be looking to either go all-in or raise. ATo is definitely strong enough to play. I should consider raising to put pressure on the blinds. Since I have 8.2 BB, a standard raise would be to 2-2.5 BB, which would be 64-80 chips. But with such short stacks, I might consider going all-in or making a larger raise.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I'm very short-stacked at 8.2 BB. I need to accumulate chips soon. The button is the best position. ATo is a decent hand. Both opponents seem to be similar players (both named Kimi-K2 variations).\n\nI should probably raise. But how much? Minimum raise is to 64 (2 BB total). That would leave me with 200 chips behind (6.25 BB). That's still playable. Or I could go all-in for 264.\n\nGiven the stack sizes, a standard raise might invite calls. An all-in might get folds more often. But ATo might be ahead of the blinds' ranges.\n\nI need to check opponent tendencies. Let me try to recall opponent actions. But I need to respond in JSON format. I'll make a decision based on general poker theory.\n\nWith 8.2 BB on the button with ATo, standard tournament strategy is to either go all-in or make a standard raise. Since I have fold equity and a decent hand, I'll raise. I'll raise to 96 chips (3 BB total, which is a raise of 64 more). That's a reasonable sizing.\n\nActually, let me calculate: My stack is 264. If I raise to 96, I'm putting in 96 total (including the call). That's a raise of 64 over the 32 BB. That leaves 168 behind (5.25 BB). That's okay.\n\nAlternatively, I could go all-in. But with ATo, I might want some fold equity. An all-in might get called by better hands and fold out worse hands. A standard raise might get calls from weaker hands.\n\nI think I'll raise to 96.

My stack is only 168, so I can't call. The only option is to fold.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there's any rule about going all-in when you can't afford the minimum.

The small blind (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) has only 16 chips total and has raised 222, which is effectively an all-in since they only had 16 chips? Wait, let me check: Seat 2 posted SB of 16, so they had 16 chips total. They raised 222, but that's impossible since they only have 16 chips. Actually, looking at the data: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips. They posted SB 16, so they have 0 left? But the action says \"Seat 2 raise 222\". That seems like a mistake or they're all-in for their remaining stack? Let me think: SB is 16, BB is 32. Seat 2 posted SB 16, so they have 0 chips left. Then they \"raise 222\" - maybe it's showing the total amount they put in? Actually, they can't raise more than they have. Perhaps the 222 is the total pot size? Let me recalculate.\n\nPot: 254 chips. That includes: SB 16, BB 32, and Seat 2 raised to 222 total? Wait, \"Seat 2 raise 222\" likely means they raised to 222 total (including their SB). So they put in 206 more (222 - 16 = 206). But they only have 16 chips total, so that can't be right.\n\nMaybe the chip counts are wrong. Let me read carefully: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips. That's their stack size. They posted SB 16, so they're all-in with their 16 chips. The \"raise 222\" might be a display error. Actually, amount to call: 190. Minimum raise to: 412. That suggests the current bet to call is 190 chips. The pot is 254 chips. If SB posted 16 and BB posted 32, that's 48. Then SB raised... to make total pot 254? Let's calculate: 48 + raise amount = 254. So raise amount = 206. That means SB raised by 206, making their total contribution 16 + 206 = 222. But they only have 16 chips, so they can't raise 206 more. Something is off.\n\nMaybe Seat 2 actually has more chips than shown? Or maybe the 16 chips is after posting SB? Actually, they posted SB 16, so their stack might be 0 now. But the display shows 16 chips as their stack. Could be they started with 16, posted SB 16, now have 0, but the display hasn't updated. The raise 222 is likely the total amount they've put in (all-in for their remaining 0?).\n\nLet me use tools to recall opponent actions to understand Kimi-K2's behavior.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with Jc Td, stack is 168 chips (5.2 BB). Blinds are 16/32. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB 32. Seat 2 folded. I posted SB 16, so I need to call 16 more to match the BB. So essentially I'm completing the blind from SB to BB? Wait, I'm Seat 3, which is BB? Actually the description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". But actions show \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 16\" and \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 32\". That seems contradictory. Let me re-read: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\" but then Seat 3 posted SB 16 and Seat 1 posted BB 32. So maybe the positions are: Seat 3 is SB, Seat 1 is BB? But it says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Could be a mislabel. Let me check: I have 168 chips, blinds 16/32. I posted 16 as SB, need to call 16 more to match BB. So I'm actually in SB facing BB's 32? Wait, Seat 1 posted BB 32. So I'm SB (Seat 3) facing BB (Seat 1). Amount to call is 16 to complete to BB. Minimum raise to 64 total (so raise additional 48). My stack is 168, so I can raise.\n\nI have JTo suited? Jc Td is offsuit. Not a great hand, but in the SB with 5.2 BB stack, I'm short stacked. In tournament poker, with 5.2 BB, I need to be looking for spots to shove or fold. JTo is not great, but maybe I can complete and see a flop? But with such a short stack, I should be thinking push/fold. Let's consider: I have 5.2 BB. If I fold, I'll have 152 chips (4.75 BB) after posting SB. If I call 16, I'll have 136 chips (4.25 BB) and see a flop. But then post-flop play will be awkward with such a short stack. Probably better to either shove or fold preflop.\n\nLet's think about opponent. Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 449 chips (14 BB). They posted BB. They haven't acted yet after my action? Wait, actions: Seat 2 folded. So it's on me (SB) to act. BB has already posted. So I'm facing the decision to complete, raise, or fold.\n\nWith JTo, I'm not thrilled. But with 5.2 BB, I should be shoving a wide range. Let's consider push/fold ranges. Typically with 5 BB, you can shove quite wide from SB vs BB. JTo is probably in the shoving range. However, we need to consider opponent tendencies. Let's use tools to recall opponent actions.",

The action: I posted SB 16, opponent posted BB 32, then seat 2 folded. Now it's on me to complete from SB to BB. Amount to call is 16 (to make it 32 total). My stack is 168 chips (5.2 BB). Opponent (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 449 chips.\n\nI need to decide: fold, call, or raise. With JTo, it's a marginal hand. I'm getting good pot odds: need to call 16 into pot of 48, so 1:3 pot odds. That's 25% equity needed. JTo likely has around 40% equity against a random hand. But opponent is in BB, so they could have any two cards.\n\nHowever, I should consider my stack size (5.2 BB) - I'm very short. This might be a spot to go all-in or fold. Calling leaves me with 136 behind (4.25 BB) going to flop out of position. That's not great.\n\nI should check opponent tendencies. But I can't use tools without proper format. Let me think: with 5.2 BB, JTo might be a shove candidate. But opponent has me covered. If I shove, I'd be raising to 168 total. Minimum raise is to 64, so shove is allowed.\n\nPotentially I could call and see a flop, but with such a short stack, playing postflop out of position is tough. JTo plays better multiway, but it's heads-up.\n\nGiven my stack size, I think shoving might be reasonable. Let me consider: if I call 16, pot becomes 64, I have 136 behind. If I check-shove any flop, opponent might call with better hands only. If I shove pre, I might get folds from weaker hands.\n\nActually, with 5.2 BB, standard short stack strategy is push/fold. JTo is borderline but probably a shove from SB vs BB. The BB is getting good odds to call though: they need to call 136 to win 168+48=216, so about 1.6:1 odds (38% equity needed). They might call with a wide range.\n\nBut I need to make a decision. Let me check if there's any info on opponent. I'll try to use the tool correctly.",

Let me check the details again.\n\nSeat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\npreflop: Seat 2 post_sb 16\npreflop: Seat 2 raise 270\n\nThat doesn't make sense - if they have only 16 chips, they can't raise 270. Maybe they're all-in? Actually, they posted SB 16, so they have 0 left? No, they have 16 chips total. After posting SB 16, they have 0. But the action says \"raise 270\". This must be an all-in situation where they're putting in their remaining chips. The amount to call is 238, which is the difference between my BB of 32 and their raise of 270? Actually, I've already posted 32 BB. They raised to 270 total? Let me calculate:\n\nPot: 302 chips\nSB posts 16, I post 32 BB. That's 48 in pot. Then SB raises 270 total? That would mean they put in 270 total, which is 254 more than their SB. But they only have 16 chips total. This seems like they're going all-in for their remaining stack.\n\nActually, looking at the amounts:\n- SB (Seat 2): 16 chips total\n- They post SB 16 (all their chips)\n- Then they \"raise 270\" - this must be an all-in for their remaining 0? Or maybe the display is wrong.\n\nWait, I should check the actual situation. I have 136 chips. Amount to call: 238. That's more than my entire stack! So I can't call even if I wanted to. The minimum raise to is 508, which is also impossible.\n\nLet me re-read: \"Amount to call: 238\" but my stack is 136. So I can only call 136 max (go all-in). But the action says \"Legal actions: fold, call\". So I can call by going all-in for my remaining 136.\n\nActually, if the SB has only 16 chips and raised 270, that's impossible. Unless... maybe the SB is actually Kimi-K2 with 16 chips, and the raiser is someone else? Let me check the players list again:\n\nSeat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 481 chips (folded)\nSeat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\nSeat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 136 chips\n\nSo Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 16 chips. They posted SB 16. Then they \"raise 270\". That doesn't add up. Unless the \"raise 270\" means they're raising to 270 total, which would require 254 more, but they only have 0 left after posting SB.\n\nI think this must be a display issue. Perhaps the SB went all-in for their remaining chips (which would be 0 after posting), but the system shows it as a raise. Or maybe they have more chips than shown.\n\nRegardless, I have Kh 3d. This is a terrible hand. I'm facing a raise. My stack is 136, amount to call is 238 (more than my stack). So if I call, I'm going all-in for my remaining 104? Wait, I already have 32 in as BB. I have 104 left. To call 238 total, I'd need to put in 206 more? No, I'm confused.\n\nLet me think mathematically:\n- I've already put in 32 as BB\n- SB posted 16, then raised to 270 total\n- To call, I need to match the 270 total, so I need to put in 238 more (270 - 32 = 238)\n- But I only have 104 left (136 - 32 = 104)\n- So I can't fully call. I can only go all-in for my remaining 104.\n\nBut the interface says \"Legal actions: fold, call\". So \"call\" here means call all-in for my remaining chips.\n\nWith Kh 3d, this is a terrible hand to call an all-in with. Even against a short stack of 16 chips, Kh 3d is weak. But wait, if SB only has 16 chips total, and they're all-in, I'm getting pot odds.\n\nLet me calculate the pot:\n- SB: 16 all-in\n- Me: 32 BB already in\n- Total pot if I call all-in: 16 + 32 + my remaining 104?

The amount to call is 238, which is more than my stack, so I can only call all-in for my remaining 104 chips.\n\nBut wait, if SB only has 16 chips, how can they raise to 270? This must be a display error. Maybe the \"raise 270\" is actually their total bet including the SB? Let me think: SB posts 16, then raises to 270 total. That means they put in 254 more, but they only have 0 left. This doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, looking at the pot size: \"Pot: 302 chips\". How did we get to 302 chips? SB 16 + BB 32 = 48. Where does 302 come from? Maybe there are antes or other players? The list shows Seat 4 and 5 have 0 chips and folded. Seat 1 folded. So only SB and me.\n\nWait, maybe the \"raise 270\" means they're raising BY 270, not TO 270. But they only have 16 chips. This is confusing.\n\nLet me check the tournament structure: Blinds: 16/32. So SB is 16, BB is 32.\n\nIf SB has 16 chips and posts SB 16, they're all-in. Then they can't raise. But the action says \"raise 270\". Maybe it's a bug in display.\n\nRegardless, I need to make a decision. With Kh 3d, this is a weak hand. Even against a very short stack, Kh 3d has only about 40% equity against a random hand. But let me consider pot odds.\n\nIf SB is all-in for 16 chips:\n- Pot would be: SB 16 + my BB 32 = 48 chips\n- I need to call additional 0? Actually, if they're all-in for 16, I've already put in 32, so I'm ahead. I would win 16 from them.\n\nBut the amount to call is 238, which suggests there's more money in pot. Pot is 302 chips. How?\n\nMaybe there are antes? Or maybe other players put in money? Let me re-read: \"Players at table: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 481 chips (folded)\". Seat 1 folded preflop. So no money from them.\n\nI'm confused. But I need to make a decision. With Kh 3d, facing what appears to be a large raise (or all-in), I should fold. Even if SB has only 16 chips, calling with Kh 3d is marginal at best.\n\nActually, let me think about tournament situation. I have 136 chips (4.2 BB). I'm very short stacked. SB has 16 chips (0.5 BB). If I fold, I'll have 104 chips left (136 - 32 BB already in = 104). Actually no, if I fold, I lose my 32 BB, so I'll have 104 left (3.25 BB).\n\nIf I call and win, I double up through SB's 16 chips.

          "content": "I need to respond with the JSON format, but first I need to analyze the situation. Let me think through this carefully.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I'm in the SB with 5d 6s\n- My stack: 120 chips (3.8 BB)\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 366 chips\n- Action: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB 32, Seat 2 raised to 318 (effectively all-in since they have 0 chips? Wait, Seat 2 has 0 chips but they raised? That seems odd - maybe they're all-in with 0 chips? Actually looking at the table: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out). So they're already out. But the action says \"Seat 2 raise 318\". This is confusing. Let me re-read.\n\nPlayers at table:\nSeat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 449 chips\nSeat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\nSeat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 120 chips (me)\nSeat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (folded)\nSeat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (folded)\n\nSo Seat 2 is \"out\" but raised? Maybe this is a mistake or they're all-in? Actually if they have 0 chips, they can't raise. Maybe the display is wrong? Or maybe they had chips when they raised and are now out? Let me check the action sequence:\n- preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 16 (me)\n- preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 32\n- preflop: Seat 2 raise 318\n\nBut Seat 2 has 0 chips. This is contradictory. Unless they went all-in with their last 318 chips and are now shown as 0? But they're listed as \"out\". Very confusing.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: Seat 1 is \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\" and Seat 2 is just \"Kimi-K2\". They might be different players. Seat 2 has 0 chips and is \"out\", meaning they're eliminated. But the action says they raised. This doesn't make sense unless it's a display error.\n\nLet me check the pot size: 366 chips. How did that happen? SB 16 + BB 32 = 48. If Seat 2 raised to 318, that would be 318 total from them. But they have 0 chips. Something is off.\n\nWait, maybe the \"raise 318\" is the total amount Seat 2 put in, not an additional raise? But they have 0 chips. This is very confusing.\n\nLet me think about the actual decision: I have 120 chips total. I've already posted SB of 16, so I have 104 left. The amount to call is 302, but I only have 104 left. So I can't call 302. I can only go all-in with my remaining 104.\n\nActually, let me calculate: My stack: 120 chips. I posted SB 16, so I have 104 left. The pot is 366. The action says \"Amount to call: 302\". But if Seat 2 raised to 318, and I already put in 16, I would need to call 302 more to match the 318 total? But I only have 104 left. So I can only go all-in.\n\nBut the legal actions are \"fold, call\" - not \"all-in\" specifically listed. But if I call, it would be an all-in since I don't have enough chips.\n\nActually, I need to understand the betting: Seat 1 (BB) has 449 chips. Seat 2 raised to 318. I have 120 total. So to call, I'd need to put in 302 more, but I only have 104 left. So I would be all-in for my remaining 104.\n\nThe minimum raise to would be 604, but I can't afford that anyway.\n\nMy hand: 5d 6s - suited connectors but not great. I'm in the SB with a very short stack (3.8 BB). This is a tournament situation.\n\nGiven my extremely short stack, I'm essentially in push/fold territory. With 3.8 BB, I should be looking to get all-in with any decent hand. 56s is not great, but it has some playability post-flop if I double up.\n\nBut I need to consider who raised. Seat 2 raised, but they have 0 chips? This is still confusing. Maybe Seat 2 is actually not out? Or maybe it's Seat 1 who raised? Let me re-examine the action: \"Seat 2 raise 318\". But Seat 2"

Looking at the actions: Seat 2 raised 318, but has 0 chips? That might be a reporting issue.\n\nActually, I need to check: Seat 2 is \"Kimi-K2\" with 0 chips (out), but they just raised 318? That doesn't make sense if they're out. Maybe it's a misprint or Seat 2 is actually still in the hand?\n\nLet me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\" - says they're out. But then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 318\". This is confusing. Perhaps Seat 2 went all-in with their remaining chips? But they have 0 chips according to the listing.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: 366 chips. Blinds are 16/32. I posted SB 16, Seat 1 posted BB 32. That's 48 total. If Seat 2 raised to 318, that would put 318 in from them, plus my 16 SB and Seat 1's 32 BB = 366 total. That checks out.\n\nBut Seat 2 has 0 chips listed. Maybe they went all-in with their last chips? Or it's a display error.\n\nRegardless, I have 120 chips total. I've already put in 16 as SB. Amount to call is 302, but I only have 104 left (120 - 16 = 104). So I can't even call the 302 - I don't have enough chips. I can only go all-in with my remaining 104.\n\nWait, let me calculate: My stack is 120. I already put in 16 as SB. So I have 104 left. The amount to call is 302, which is more than my entire stack.

But I can't call 302 with only 104 left. Unless... in tournament poker, if a player doesn't have enough to call, they can go all-in for their remaining chips. That would be a \"call\" of my remaining stack.\n\nSo I need to decide: fold my 5d6s, or go all-in with my remaining 104 chips.\n\nLet me think about the hand: 5d6s is a weak hand, especially against a raise. But I'm very short-stacked at 3.8 BB. This might be a spot where I need to take a stand.\n\nBut first, let me check opponent tendencies. I'll use the recall tool.",

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB of 32. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 318. Wait, that's confusing - Seat 2 has 0 chips according to the player list but raised 318? Let me check again: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\" - that means they're out of the tournament. But the action says \"Seat 2 raise 318\". That seems contradictory. Maybe it's a misprint or Seat 2 is actually not out? Let me re-read: \"Players at table: Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\". So they're out. Yet they raised? That doesn't make sense. Perhaps the action happened before they went out? Or maybe it's Seat 1 who raised? The action says \"Seat 2 raise 318\" but Seat 2 is out. This is confusing.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 449 chips\" and \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\". These are two different players. Seat 2 raised 318, but has 0 chips? That can't be right. Unless they went all-in with their last 318 chips and are now at 0? But it says they have 0 chips and are \"out\". Maybe the chip count is after the raise? If they raised 318 and had 318 chips, they'd be at 0 after raising. That makes sense - they're all-in.\n\nSo Seat 2 raised all-in to 318. I need to call 302 chips. My stack is 120 chips total. Wait, I have 120 chips total. I already posted SB of 16, so I have 104 left. To call 302, I'd need to put in 302 total? Let me calculate: The pot is 366. Amount to call is 302. Minimum raise to is 604. My stack is 120 total. I already put in 16 for SB, so I have 104 left. The amount to call is 302, which is more than my entire stack (120). So I can't call 302 - I can only go all-in for my remaining 104. Actually, if I call, I'd be putting in all my chips since 302 > 120. So I can either fold or go all-in (call).\n\nLegal actions are fold, call. So I can call all-in.\n\nI have 5d6s, a very weak hand. I'm getting pot odds: pot is 366 + 318 (raise) = 684? Let me calculate properly. Current pot: 366. That includes my 16 SB, BB 32, and raise 318? Actually: SB 16 + BB 32 + raise 318 = 366. Yes. If I call all-in for my remaining 104, total pot would be 366 + 104 = 470. But wait, Seat 2 raised to 318, which is more than my stack. They have me covered. So if I call, I'm only putting in 104 more (total 120). The pot would be: SB 16 + BB 32 + my call 104 + their raise 318 = 470. Actually, their raise is 318 total, which includes their 32 BB? No, they raised from BB position? Let's see: Seat 1 posted BB 32. Seat 2 raised 318. That means Seat 2 put in 318 total, which is a raise of 286 over the BB (318 - 32 = 286). So pot is: my SB 16 + BB 32 + raise 318 = 366.\n\nIf I call all-in for 104 more (total 120), pot becomes 366 + 104 = 470. I'm putting in 104 to win 470, giving me pot odds of about 4.5:1. That's good odds, but with 5d6s against what's likely a strong hand (all-in raise), my equity is poor.\n\nI should recall opponent actions to see what Seat 2 tends to raise with.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Tc 2s - This is an extremely weak hand. Ten-high with a 2 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (button) - Good position, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n3. **My stack**: 120 chips (1.9 BB) - Critically short-stacked. I'm essentially in push/fold territory.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 1 (SB): 417 chips, appears to be tight - folded 9 of last 10 hands preflop\n   - Seat 2 (BB): 302 chips, more aggressive - raised 5 of last 10 hands preflop\n\n5. **Action**: It's folded to me on the button. I need to call 64 chips to see a flop, which is more than half my stack (64/120 = 53%). \n\n6. **Pot odds**: Pot is 96 chips, I need to call 64. That's 1.5:1 pot odds (96:64). I need ~40% equity to break even.\n\n7. **Hand equity**: Tc2s has terrible equity against any reasonable range. Even against random cards, it's only ~35% equity. Against the BB's likely raising range, it's much worse.\n\n8. **Tournament situation**: With only 1.9 BB, I need to find a better spot. Calling off more than half my stack with Tc2s is terrible. I should wait for a better hand or position.\n\n9. **Alternatives**: I could consider going all-in, but with Tc2s and only 120 chips total (64 to call + 56 remaining), I'd be risking everything on a terrible hand. The BB has been raising frequently, so they might call with a wide range, but my hand is still terrible.\n\nThe correct play is clearly to fold. I need to preserve my stack for a better opportunity. With only 1.9 BB, I'll have to go all-in soon, but I should do it with a better hand than Tc2s. Even if I were to shove, I'd need to put in my remaining 56 chips after calling 64, making it effectively an all-in for 120 total, but that's still with a terrible hand.\n\nWait, let me check the math again: If I call 64, I'll have 56 left. The pot would be 96 + 64 = 160. Then on the flop, I'd have 56 left with pot of 160. I'd be committed anyway. So it's effectively an all-in decision.\n\nBut with Tc2s, this is an easy fold. I should wait for a better spot. Even random cards would be better than this.\n\nLet me check if there are any antes or other factors... No, just blinds.\n\nGiven the BB's aggressive tendencies, they might not have a strong hand, but my hand is so weak that I'm likely dominated.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with 3h5h, which is a very weak hand. My stack is only 56 chips (0.9 BB), so I'm essentially all-in with any call. The pot is 192 chips, and I need to call 64 chips. However, I only have 56 chips total, and I've already posted 64 as the BB? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 64\". This seems contradictory - if I have 56 chips, how can I post 64 as BB? Maybe the 56 is after posting? Actually, looking at the action: Seat 2 (SB) posted 32, I posted 64 as BB, then Seat 2 raised 128. So total pot is 32 + 64 + 128 = 224? But it says pot is 192 chips. Let me calculate: SB 32 + BB 64 + raise 128 = 224. But maybe the raise amount includes the SB? Seat 2 had to call 32 more to match BB, then raise additional 96? Actually standard: SB posts 32, BB posts 64. Then SB can raise. Minimum raise would be to 128 total (64 + 64). Seat 2 raised 128, which is exactly double the BB. So total pot: SB 32 + BB 64 + raise amount 128 = 224. But display says 192. Maybe the 128 is total amount Seat 2 put in? That would be: SB 32 + additional 96 to make 128 total. Then pot = 64 (BB) + 128 (SB total) = 192. Yes that makes sense: Seat 2 put in 128 total (32 SB + 96 raise). So I need to call 64 more to match the 128 total.\n\nBut I only have 56 chips total. Actually wait: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\". That must be after posting the BB? If I started with 120 chips, posted 64 BB, I'd have 56 left. So I have 56 chips behind, and need to call 64 more. I can only call 56 (all-in). So effectively I'm all-in if I call.\n\nNow, opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising frequently based on history: hand 96 raised 222, 99 raised 270, 100 raised 318. Seems aggressive. My hand 3h5h is terrible, but I'm getting pot odds. Let me calculate: If I call all-in for 56 chips, total pot will be: current 192 + my 56 = 248 chips. I need to put in 56 to win 248, so need ~22.6% equity.\n\nAgainst a random hand, 3h5h has about 38% equity. Even against a tight range like top 20%, it has ~32%. So pot odds justify a call with any two cards given I'm so short. But wait, I'm in a tournament. With 0.9 BB, I'm basically dead anyway. Folding leaves me with 56 chips (0.9 BB) which is essentially zero - I'll be all-in next hand in SB anyway. So I should call with any two cards.\n\nBut let me check if there's any ICM considerations. It's a tournament, but with 0.9 BB, I have no fold equity. Calling gives me a chance to double up to ~1.8 BB, still short but better than 0.9 BB.\n\nActually, wait: If I fold, I have 56 chips. Next hand I'll be SB (32) and BB (64). I'll have to post 32 SB, leaving 24, then be all-in for BB. Actually the blinds are 32/64, so I'd have to post 32 as SB next hand, leaving 24, then be all-in for BB if someone raises. But I might get a walk if everyone folds. Still, very dire.\n\nGiven pot odds and tournament situation, I should call. Even with 3h5h, it's better than folding to have a chance.\n\nBut let me think about opponent's range. From showdowns: they showed 44, 5K, KK, TQ, 2K. Mixed range. They're raising frequently. Could be wide.\n\nDecision: Call all-in. Since I can't afford the full 64, I'll be all-in for my remaining 56.\n\nAction: call (which puts me all-in).\n\nResponse JSON: {\"action\": \"call\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"Stack is 0.9 BB, pot odds justify call with any"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with 3h5h, a very weak hand. My stack is only 56 chips (0.9 BB). Actually wait, I already posted BB of 64? Let me check: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 64\". That seems contradictory. If I have 56 chips and posted BB of 64, I'd be all-in. But maybe the stack is after posting? Let me re-read: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\" - that's my current stack. Blinds are 32/64. I posted BB of 64, so I had 120 chips before posting? Actually if I have 56 chips now, and I posted 64, that means I started with 120 chips? That doesn't make sense either.\n\nWait, maybe the stack display is before posting? Let me think: I'm in BB, so I posted 64. My stack shows 56 chips. That means I have 56 chips left after posting the BB? But 56 + 64 = 120, which would be 1.875 BB. Hmm.\n\nActually, looking at the action: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 128\". Seat 2 (SB) posted SB 32, then raised to 128 total. So they put in 32 + 96 raise = 128 total. I need to call 64 more (since I already put in 64 as BB). My stack is 56 chips, so I can only call 56 more? Actually I have 56 chips total, not 56 chips to call. I need to understand my exact chip situation.\n\nLet me check: \"Amount to call: 64\". That means I need to put in 64 more chips. But my stack is only 56 chips. So I can only call 56, which would be all-in. But the interface says \"Legal actions: fold, call\". It doesn't say \"all-in\" but calling would put me all-in since I have less than the call amount.\n\nThis is a tournament situation. I have 0.9 BB effectively. With 3h5h suited, it's a very weak hand. But I'm in the BB, already invested 64 chips. The pot is 192 chips (SB 32 + my BB 64 + raise 96 = 192). I need to call 64 more, but I only have 56 chips. So I'd be all-in for 56 chips.\n\nPot odds: If I call 56, the pot will be 192 + 56 = 248 chips. I'm getting about 4.4:1 pot odds (248:56). That's decent.\n\nBut hand strength: 3h5h is weak, but suited connectors can have some equity. Against a typical SB raising range, what's my equity? Let me think: SB raised from the small blind after everyone folded. Their range could be wide since they're stealing. They might have any two cards.\n\nGiven I have only 0.9 BB left, this is basically a mandatory call. I'm getting good pot odds, and I'm so short stacked that I should take any chance to double up. Even with 3h5h, I have some equity against random cards.\n\nBut let me check opponent tendencies. Seat 2 is \"Kimi-K2\". Let me recall their actions.",

Actually: SB posted 32, BB posted 64, opponent raised 128 total which includes his SB? Wait, let's calculate: SB posted 32, I posted 64, opponent raised to 128 total. So opponent put in 128, which is 96 more than his SB. So pot = 32 + 64 + 128 = 224? No, that can't be right. Let me re-read: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 128\" - this is the total amount he put in. He already posted SB 32, so additional 96. So total pot = SB 32 + BB 64 + raise 96 = 192. Yes.\n- I need to call 64 more chips (but I only have 56 total stack, so I'm all-in for my remaining stack)\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 raises frequently preflop (222, 222, 222, 270, 318 raises seen). Shows down with various hands: 44, K5s, KK, QT, K2. So he raises with a wide range.\n\nMy hand: 3h5h suited. With only 0.9 BB stack, I'm effectively all-in. Pot odds: I need to call 56 chips (my whole stack) to win 192 + 56 = 248 chips? Actually, pot is 192, opponent has bet 128 total (96 more than SB). If I call, I put in 56 more, pot becomes 192 + 56 = 248. I get 248:56 odds, about 4.4:1.\n\nWith 3h5h suited, against a wide raising range, I have decent equity. Suited connectors can hit flushes, straights. Even against a premium hand like AK, I have ~30% equity. Against a wider range, better.\n\nTournament situation: I have 0.9 BB, basically desperate. If I fold, I'll have 56 chips (0.9 BB) next hand in SB, forced to post 32, leaving 24 chips (0.375 BB). Very dire.\n\nGiven pot odds and stack situation, calling is correct. I'm getting good odds, and I need to double up to survive.\n\nAction: call (all-in).",

The pot is 192 chips, and I need to call 64 chips. However, I only have 56 chips total, and I've already posted 64 as the BB? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 64\". This seems contradictory - if I have 56 chips, how can I post 64 as BB? Maybe the 56 is after posting? Actually, looking at the action: Seat 2 (SB) posted 32, I posted 64 as BB, then Seat 2 raised 128. So total pot is 32 + 64 + 128 = 224? But it says pot is 192 chips. Let me calculate: SB 32 + BB 64 + raise 128 = 224. But maybe the raise amount includes the SB? Seat 2 had to call 32 more to match BB, then raise additional 96? Actually standard: SB posts 32, BB posts 64. Then SB can raise. Minimum raise would be to 128 total (64 + 64). Seat 2 raised 128, which is exactly double the BB. So total pot: SB 32 + BB 64 + raise amount 128 = 224. But display says 192. Maybe the 128 is total amount Seat 2 put in? That would be: SB 32 + additional 96 to make 128 total. Then pot = 64 (BB) + 128 (SB total) = 192. Yes that makes sense: Seat 2 put in 128 total (32 SB + 96 raise). So I need to call 64 more to match the 128 total.\n\nBut I only have 56 chips total. Actually wait: \"Your Stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB)\". That must be after posting the BB? If I started with 120 chips, posted 64 BB, I'd have 56 left. So I have 56 chips behind, and need to call 64 more. I can only call 56 (all-in). So effectively I'm all-in if I call.\n\nNow, opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising frequently based on history: hand 96 raised 222, 99 raised 270, 100 raised 318. Seems aggressive. My hand 3h5h is terrible, but I'm getting pot odds. Let me calculate: If I call all-in for 56 chips, total pot will be: current 192 + my 56 = 248 chips. I need to put in 56 to win 248, so need ~22.6% equity.\n\nAgainst a random hand, 3h5h has about 38% equity. Even against a tight range like top 20%, it has ~32%. So pot odds justify a call with any two cards given I'm so short. But wait, I'm in a tournament. With 0.9 BB, I'm basically dead anyway. Folding leaves me with 56 chips (0.9 BB) which is essentially zero - I'll be all-in next hand in SB anyway. So I should call with any two cards.\n\nBut let me check if there's any ICM considerations.

I'm in the BB according to the header, but actions show Seat 3 (me) posted SB 32, and Seat 1 posted BB 64. This is confusing. Let me check the table setup: 5 seats, but seats 4 and 5 have 0 chips and folded. So only 3 players: Seat 1 (353 chips), Seat 2 (278 chips, folded), and me Seat 3 (208 chips). Blinds are 32/64.\n\nThe actions: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 32, Seat 1 post_bb 64, Seat 2 fold. So I posted SB 32, Seat 1 posted BB 64. That means I'm SB, Seat 1 is BB. But the header says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". That's contradictory. However, the \"Amount to call: 32\" makes sense if I'm SB: I've posted 32, need to call 32 more to match BB's 64.\n\nThus, I'm SB with 9c9d, stack 208 chips (3.2 BB). I've already posted 32, so I have 176 left. Pot is 96 (32+64). It's heads-up against BB. I need to decide: fold, call 32, or raise to at least 128 total.\n\nMy hand: pocket 9s is a decent hand, especially heads-up. With only 3.2 BB effective stack (my stack is 208, BB is 64, so 3.25 BB actually). Actually, my stack is 208, BB is 64, so I have 3.25 BB. That's extremely short-stacked. Pocket 9s is a premium hand with such a short stack. I should be looking to get all-in preflop.\n\nBut let's consider: if I raise, minimum raise to 128 total. That would be putting 128 total, meaning I raise 96 more (since I've already put 32). That would leave me with 80 chips (208-128). Then BB could call or raise. If BB calls, pot would be 256 (96+96+64? Let's calculate: my raise to 128 total, BB has already put 64, needs to call additional 64 to match my 128. So pot would be 128+128=256). If BB raises, I'd have to call remaining 80 chips.\n\nGiven my short stack, I should probably go all-in. But legal actions don't include all-in? Actually, I can raise to any amount up to my stack. Minimum raise to 128, but I can raise more, up to 208 (my total stack). With pocket 9s and 3.25 BB, going all-in is standard.\n\nBut let me think about opponent tendencies. I should use tools to recall opponent actions. Let me search for Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) behavior. Use recall_opponent_actions.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to provide a JSON response with action, raise_to, and reasoning. But first I should analyze the hand properly. Let me think through the situation without using tools since the system is complaining about format.\n\nI have 9c9d. Stack is 208 chips (3.2 BB). Blinds 32/64. Pot is 96. I need to call 32. Minimum raise to 128 total. Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nI'm likely in SB position based on actions (posted SB 32). Opponent in BB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 353 chips.\n\nWith pocket 9s, this is a strong hand heads-up. My stack is short (3.2 BB). In tournament poker with short stack, pocket 9s is a premium hand. I should be looking to get all-in preflop. Folding is not an option. Calling is okay but raising is better to build pot and potentially take it down preflop.\n\nIf I raise, minimum raise to 128 total. That would be putting 128 total, meaning I raise 96 more on top of the 32 I already posted? Actually I've posted 32 SB, so to raise to 128 total, I need to put 96 more (32+96=128). That leaves me with 112 chips (208-96). That's a significant portion of my stack. Alternatively, I could go all-in for 208 total. But legal actions only show raise, not all-in specifically. But I can raise to any amount up to my stack. Minimum raise to 128, maximum 208.\n\nGiven my short stack, pushing all-in is standard with 99. The opponent has me covered. If I raise to 128, I'm committing more than half my stack anyway, so might as well go all-in to maximize fold equity and avoid playing postflop with awkward stack.\n\nBut let me consider: if I raise to 128, opponent might call or raise. If they call, pot will be 128 (my raise) + 64 (their BB) + 32 (my SB) = 224? Wait recalc: Pot currently 96 (32 SB + 64 BB). If I raise to 128 total, I put 96 more (since I already put 32). Total pot becomes 96 + 96 = 192. Opponent needs to call 64 more (128 total - 64 they already put). So pot would be 192 + 64 = 256 if they call. I'd have 112 left behind. That's awkward for postflop play.\n\nBetter to go all-in for 208 total. That's a raise of 176 more (208-32). Pot would be 96 + 176 = 272. Opponent needs to call 144 more (208-64). They have 353 chips, so they can call.\n\nWith 99 and 3.2 BB stack, all-in is correct. Let me check if there are any tournament considerations. We're in a tournament, short stack. Need to accumulate chips. 99 is strong enough to go all-in.\n\nI'll go all-in. Let me structure the JSON response.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to think about this situation. I'm on the button with 6s 9d, which is a weak hand. My stack is 304 chips (4.8 BB), which is very short. The blinds are 32/64, so I have about 4.8 BB. Looking at the opponent actions, Kimi-K2 in seat 2 (the BB) has been raising frequently from what I can see - raises in hands 94, 96, 99, 100, and 102. They seem to be aggressive.\n\nHowever, I'm on the button with only the SB and BB left to act. The SB has 321 chips, BB has 214 chips. With 6s 9d, this is a terrible hand to play, especially with such a short stack. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call.\n\nIf I call 64 chips, that's 21% of my stack going in with a weak hand. The pot would be 160 chips (96 + 64). Then I'd have 240 chips left, which is 3.75 BB. I'd be out of position post-flop if the SB calls or raises.\n\nBetter to either shove or fold. Given my hand strength (6-9 offsuit), folding is probably correct. I could consider shoving as a steal attempt since I'm on the button and the blinds might fold, but with 4.8 BB, a shove would be 304 total. The BB only has 214, so they'd be calling for their tournament life if they call. The SB has 321.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: BB has 214 (3.34 BB), SB has 321 (5 BB). If I shove 304, BB would need to call 150 more (214 - 64 already posted) to win 458 (96 + 304). That's about 2.3:1 pot odds, which is good. They might call with a wide range.\n\nWith 6-9 offsuit, I don't want to get called. The fold equity might be decent since I'm shoving from the button, but my hand is so weak that if I get called, I'm likely dominated.\n\nGiven my short stack, I should be looking for better spots. There are only 3 players at the table (SB, BB, and me), so blinds come around quickly. I might get a better hand soon.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. Let me check if there are any other considerations. The SB hasn't acted yet - they could raise. If I call and then SB raises, I'd be in a tough spot.\n\nFolding seems best. Let me also check my own hand history to see if I've been playing aggressively or passively.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the BB with 9s Tc. My stack is 240 chips (3.8 BB). The blinds are 32/64. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted SB 32 and then called 32 more, so they've put in 64 total. I've already posted BB 64. The pot is 128 chips. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nI should check my opponent's tendencies. From the search results, I see Kimi-K2 has been raising preflop in several hands (96, 99, 100, 102). In hand 102, they raised to 128 from SB when I was BB with 3h5h and I called. That hand I won with a straight. In this hand, they just called from SB instead of raising. That's interesting - they have 492 chips (7.7 BB), which is a decent stack compared to mine (3.8 BB).\n\nMy hand is 9s Tc, which is a weak hand but not terrible for defending the BB. Given my short stack (3.8 BB), I need to consider push/fold ranges. With 3.8 BB, I should be looking to shove with a wider range when facing a limp. But here the SB limped, so I'm getting a free look at the flop if I check.\n\nHowever, I should consider raising. The minimum raise is to 128 (doubling the BB). That would put 64 more chips in (128 total). My stack would then be 176 behind. If I raise and get called, the pot would be 256 and I'd have 176 behind (less than pot).\n\nActually, with 3.8 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. 9T suited is actually a decent hand to shove with against a limp from SB. The SB has shown aggression with raises, but here they limped, which suggests weakness.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations. I'm very short (3.8 BB). I need to accumulate chips soon. Checking to see a flop with 9T suited is okay, but if I miss the flop, I'll have to fold to any bet. If I shove now, I might get folds from weak limping hands.\n\nWait, I need to check the exact stack sizes and pot odds. If I shove for my remaining 176 (240 - 64 already in), the pot would be 128 + 176 = 304. They'd have to call 176 to win 304, giving them 1.73:1 odds (36.5% equity needed). They have 492 chips, so calling 176 would leave them with 316.\n\n9T suited has about 40% equity against a random hand. Against a typical limping range from SB (maybe 22-99, suited connectors, weak aces, etc.), it might have similar or better equity.\n\nActually, I should check. The SB limped, which often means a weak hand trying to see a cheap flop. They might fold to a shove. If they call, I have decent equity.\n\nGiven my desperate stack size (3.8 BB), I think shoving is correct. Checking is too passive and I'll likely have to fold on most flops.\n\nBut wait, I need to see if \"raise\" is a legal action. Yes, it is. The minimum raise to is 128. I could raise to 128 (putting in 64 more), but that leaves me with 176 behind and creates a weird SPR. Actually, with 3.8 BB, just shoving is probably better.\n\nLet me calculate: if I raise to 128 (put 64 more), pot is 192. They'd have to call 64 more. If they call, pot is 256, I have 176 behind. Then postflop, any bet I make will be committing. So I might as well shove now.\n\nYes, with 3.8 BB, jamming is standard with a wide range. 9T suited is definitely in my jamming range against a limp.\n\nI'll shove. Raise_to should be 240 (my total stack).",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: Ks 5c (off-suit King-5)\n- Position: SB (small blind)\n- My stack: 336 chips (5.2 BB)\n- Pot: 224 chips\n- Action: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 128 total (64 more than BB)\n- Amount to call: 96 chips\n- BB (Seat 1) has only 11 chips left\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength:** K5o is a weak hand, especially from the SB. King-5 offsuit has poor playability postflop.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm in the worst position (SB) and will be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes:** \n   - I have 336 chips (5.2 BB)\n   - Seat 2 (raiser) has 364 chips\n   - Seat 1 (BB) has only 11 chips and will likely fold or go all-in\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the recall, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raises frequently preflop. Looking at their raises: 128, 318, 270, 222, 222, 222, 378, 96, 250, 234. They seem to be an aggressive player. Their showdown hands include K2, 88, Q7 - so they're raising with a wide range.\n\n5. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 224, I need to call 96. That's 2.33:1 pot odds (30% equity needed). K5o vs a typical raising range has about 35-40% equity, but being out of position reduces that.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** With only 5.2 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. However, I have position on the BB who has only 11 chips and will likely fold. This creates a heads-up situation against the raiser.\n\n7. **Alternative Options:** \n   - Fold: Preserve my stack for a better spot\n   - Call: See a flop with marginal odds, but out of position\n   - Raise: With K5o, raising seems too aggressive\n\n**Decision:** I should fold. K5o from the SB is too weak to call a raise, especially when I'll be out of position. The pot odds are decent (30% equity needed), but postflop play will be difficult with this hand. With only 5.2 BB, I should wait for a better spot to get my chips in.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any ICM pressure or bubble situation... The BB has only 11 chips, so they're essentially all-in blind next hand. This might create some fold equity if I raise, but with K5o, that's too speculative.\n\nActually, wait - the BB has 11 chips. If I call 96, the pot becomes 320. The BB only has 11 chips, so they can only call 11 more. This creates a side pot situation. But still, K5o is too weak.\n\nI'll fold and preserve my stack for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 7h Kd, with 304 chips (4.8 BB). I've posted the small blind of 32, and the big blind (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) has posted 64. So I need to call 32 more to match the big blind.\n\nFrom the opponent data, I can see Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been quite active preflop, raising frequently. In recent hands, they raised to 128 in hand #106, called in hand #105, and raised in several others. They have 503 chips (7.9 BB), so they have me covered.\n\nMy hand, K7o, is weak - especially offsuit. I'm on the button, which is good position, but with such a short stack (4.8 BB), I need to consider push/fold ranges. With K7o, this is a marginal hand for pushing from the button when facing just the big blind.\n\nLooking at pot odds: I need to call 32 to win a pot of 96 (my 32 SB + their 64 BB). That's 1:3 pot odds, or 25% equity needed. K7o has about 55% equity against a random hand, so mathematically it's a call. However, the BB might not have a random hand - they might defend with a tighter range.\n\nGiven my stack size of 4.8 BB, I should be looking to shove or fold preflop rather than call. Calling leaves me with 4.3 BB postflop, which is awkward. With K7o, this is probably a fold or shove decision.\n\nLet me check if there are any antes - no, just blinds. With 4.8 BB, standard short stack strategy would be to push with a wider range from the button against a single BB. K7o is borderline but probably a shove against an unknown opponent.\n\nHowever, I have data on this opponent. They've been raising frequently preflop, but they've also folded to aggression. In hand #105, they called a raise from me (when I had 9s Tc and raised from BB). \n\nActually, looking at the situation: I've already posted 32 as SB. If I fold, I lose 32. If I call, I put in 32 more (total 64) and see a flop with 240 behind (3.75 BB). If I shove, I put in my remaining 272 (304 total).\n\nThe minimum raise is to 128, which would be 96 more (32 call + 64 raise). That leaves me with 208 behind (3.25 BB).\n\nGiven my stack size, shoving seems reasonable. K7o has decent equity against a BB's calling range. The BB has to call 240 more to win 368 (304 my stack + 64 their BB), getting about 1.5:1 odds. They'd need about 40% equity to call.\n\nLet me think about the opponent's likely calling range. They have 503 chips, so calling my shove doesn't put them at risk. They might call with a wide range given the odds.\n\nActually, wait - I need to consider that I'm not facing a raise. The BB has just posted, so I can complete the small blind or raise. With K7o from the button against a single BB, I think the best play is to shove. Calling is bad because it leaves me with an awkward stack postflop.\n\nLooking at recent hands: In hand #103, I raised with 99 from SB and won. In hand #105, I raised with T9o from BB and won. So I've been aggressive with marginal hands.\n\nI think shoving is the right play here. Let me calculate: If I shove for 304 total, the BB has to call 240 more (304 - 64 they already have in). They're getting 368:240 or about 1.53:1, needing ~39.5% equity.\n\nK7o has about 60% equity against a random hand. Against a top 40% range, it has about 52% equity. Against a top 30% range, about 48%. So it's close.\n\nBut tournament-wise, I'm very short at 4.8 BB. I need to accumulate chips soon. The button is the best position. I think shoving is correct.\n\nActually, I should check if \"raise\" is in my legal actions. Yes, it is. I can raise to any amount up to my stack.\n\nI'll shove all-in.",

K7o is not a great hand, but with only 4.8 BB and being on the button against a single blind, this is a standard shove spot in tournament poker. The BB has to defend very wide when I'm this short.

          "reasoning_content": "I'm in a tournament hand. I'm on the button with 7h Kd, board is Js 4s 9s. My stack is only 32 chips (0.5 BB), which is all-in preflop as I posted SB 32 and raised 304? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me parse the situation.\n\nMy stack: 32 chips (0.5 BB). Blinds: 32/64. I posted SB 32, opponent posted BB 64. I raised 304? That can't be right since I only have 32 chips total. Actually, looking at actions: preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32, Seat 2 post_bb 64, Seat 3 raise 304, Seat 2 call 240. But I only have 32 chips total. Something seems off.\n\nWait, maybe the stack sizes are current after posting? Let me think: My stack is 32 chips. I posted SB 32, so I'm all-in preflop with my 32 chips. But the action says I raised 304. That must be a mistake or misunderstanding. Perhaps the 304 is the total pot? Or maybe I'm misreading.\n\nActually, re-reading: \"Your Stack: 32 chips (0.5 BB)\" - that's my current stack. But I already posted SB 32, so I have 0 chips left? No, wait, if I have 32 chips and post SB 32, then I have 0 chips left. But then I can't raise. Something is inconsistent.\n\nLet me check the pot: 608 chips. That's large. Preflop: SB 32 + BB 64 + my \"raise\" 304 + opponent's call 240 = 640 total? Actually 32+64+304+240=640, close to 608 (maybe some rounding).\n\nI think the key point: I have 32 chips total, which is 0.5 BB. I'm essentially all-in preflop with my 32 chips. The flop came Js 4s 9s. Opponent checked. I have Kd 7h, no spade. Board has three spades. I have nothing - no pair, no draw. My hand is terrible.\n\nBut wait, I'm already all-in preflop with my 32 chips. The action says \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check\". Since I'm all-in, I can't bet more. I should just check and see the turn and river.\n\nBut can I fold? If I'm all-in, I can't fold - my money is already in. But the interface says fold is a legal action. Maybe I can fold on the flop even though I'm all-in? That doesn't make sense in poker. Once you're all-in, you're committed.\n\nPerhaps there's a misunderstanding: Maybe my stack is 32 chips AFTER posting SB? So I have 32 chips left, not all-in. But then I posted SB 32, which would leave me with 0. Hmm.\n\nLet me use tools to understand better. First, let me recall my recent hands to see similar situations.",

          "reasoning_content": "Looking at the current situation:\n\n- I'm on the BTN with 7h Kd\n- My stack is only 32 chips (0.5 BB) - I'm essentially all-in\n- Board is Js 4s 9s (three spades)\n- Pot is 608 chips\n- Opponent (Seat 2) has checked\n- I have 0 chips left, so I'm effectively all-in already\n- My only legal actions are fold or check\n\nThis is an interesting spot. I have K7 offsuit on a Js 4s 9s board. I have no spade, so I'm not on a flush draw. I have a gutshot straight draw (10 would give me a straight with K-Q-10-9-8? Actually no, I have K7, so I need 10-8-6-5? Let me think: Board is J-9-4, I have K-7. Best possible straight would be K-Q-J-10-9 or maybe 10-9-8-7-6? Actually with K7 on J94 board, I have no realistic straight draw.\n\nMy hand is weak: King high with no pair, no flush draw, no good draws. However, I'm already all-in with my last 32 chips. The pot is 608 chips, and opponent has checked. If I check, we go to the turn and river, and I might get lucky.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They seem to be fairly active with raises preflop. They called my preflop raise of 304 (I put in 304 total, which was essentially my whole stack minus the SB). They called with 240 more.\n\nGiven that I'm already all-in and the pot is huge relative to my stack (608 vs my 32), folding makes no sense. I should check and see the next cards. I have nothing to lose - I'm already all-in.\n\nWait, but I can still fold? Actually no, I'm already all-in. My stack is 0, I have no more chips to put in. The \"fold\" option would mean forfeiting the hand, but I'm already all-in. I should check to see the turn and river.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: \"Your Stack: 32 chips (0.5 BB)\" - but I already put in my SB of 32 and raised to 304? Wait, that doesn't add up. Let me re-read:\n\n- preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32 (that's me)\n- preflop: Seat 2 post_bb 64  \n- preflop: Seat 3 raise 304 (that's me raising to 304 total)\n- preflop: Seat 2 call 240\n\nSo I had 32 chips, posted SB of 32, then raised to 304? That doesn't make sense if I only have 32 total. Unless there's something about tournament chips? Actually, maybe \"Your Stack: 32 chips\" means I have 32 chips remaining after posting SB? Let me think:\n\nStarting stack: unknown\nI post SB 32\nI raise to 304 total\nBut if I only have 32 total, I can't raise to 304.\n\nActually, looking at the action: \"Seat 3 raise 304\" - this might mean I raised by 304 more? But that would be 32 (SB) + 304 = 336 total, which I don't have.\n\nHmm, maybe the stack display is wrong or there's tournament mechanics. Regardless, the key point: I'm facing a check on the flop, and my only legal actions are fold or check. With a pot of 608 and my hand, even though it's weak, I should check and see what happens. Folding when checked to would be terrible.\n\nActually wait - I might be misunderstanding. If I'm already all-in, then checking is automatic? But the system is giving me fold/check as options. I should check.\n\nMy reasoning: I have King-high, which might be the best hand if opponent missed completely. The board is Js 4s 9s - all spades. Opponent checked, which could mean weakness. I have no spade, so no flush draw. But checking costs nothing and I get to see two more cards. Folding would forfeit any chance to win the pot.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 0.5 BB left essentially. This is a do-or-die situation. I should check and hope to improve or have my King-high hold up.\n\nLet me check opponent's showdown history to see what they call with. From the data: They showed down with some weak hands like K2, Q7, etc. They might have called my preflop raise with a wide range.\n\nI'll check.",

Let's think: preflop actions: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 32, Seat 2 post_bb 64, then Seat 3 raise 304, Seat 2 call 240.\n\nIf I have 32 chips total, posting SB 32 leaves me with 0. But I raised 304?

That's still impossible because I only have 32 left. Wait, maybe the raise amount is the total amount to put in, not additional. So raise 304 total means I need to put in 304 total.

But 304 is way bigger.\n\nPerhaps the stack shown is before posting blinds? Let's think: I have 32 chips total. Blinds are 32/64. I'm SB, so I post 32, which is my entire stack.

Pot is 608 chips.\n\nI posted SB 32, opponent posted BB 64. I raised 304 preflop (all-in? Wait, my stack is 32 chips, but I raised 304? That doesn't make sense. Let me check: My stack is 32 chips, I posted SB 32, so I had 0 left. But then I raised 304? That seems impossible. Maybe the display is wrong or I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read: \"Your Stack: 32 chips (0.5 BB)\". Actually, I think I have 32 chips total. I posted SB 32, so I'm all-in preflop. But then it says I raised 304. That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the stack display is at the river? Let me trace: Preflop: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 32. Seat 2 post_bb 64. Then I raise 304. But I only have 32 chips total. Unless I had more chips earlier and lost some? Let me check the pot size: 608 chips. That's consistent with: SB 32 + BB 64 + my raise 304 + opponent call 240? Actually opponent call 240. Let me calculate: SB 32, BB 64, my raise 304, opponent call 240. Total: 32+64+304+240 = 640? Actually 32+64=96, +304=400, +240=640. But pot is 608. Hmm.\n\nMaybe the raise 304 includes my SB? So I put in total 304, which includes my 32 SB plus 272 more? And opponent called 240, which is the difference between 304 and 64? Actually BB is 64, so to call my raise, opponent needs to put in 304-64=240. That matches.\n\nSo I effectively went all-in preflop with 32 chips? Wait, but I raised to 304 total. That means I had more than 32 chips. The stack display of 32 chips must be my current stack at river? But if I raised to 304 preflop, I would have put in 304 chips. That would be more than 32. So maybe the stack display is wrong, or I'm misreading.\n\nLet me think: I'm DeepSeek-V3.2 with 32 chips. That's 0.5 BB. I posted SB 32, so I'm all-in. But then I raised 304? That's impossible. Unless the stack is after posting SB? Actually, if I have 32 chips total, posting SB 32 leaves me with 0. So I can't raise. So the raise must have happened earlier when I had more chips. Maybe the stack display is my remaining stack after the preflop action? But then I would have negative chips.\n\nI think there's a misunderstanding. Let me look at the hand history: I'm seat 3, posted SB 32. Opponent seat 2 posted BB 64. Then I raised 304. That means I put in 304 total, which is 272 more than my SB. So I must have had at least 304 chips preflop. But now my stack is 32 chips. So maybe I lost chips in this hand? Or the stack display is my remaining stack after the raise? If I raised to 304, and started with X chips, then after raising I have X-304 left. But it says my stack is 32 chips. So X = 336 chips. That makes sense: I started with 336 chips, posted SB 32, raised to 304 total (put in 272 more), leaving me with 336-304=32 chips. Yes! That's it. So I have 32 chips left after the preflop raise.\n\nSo preflop: I raised to 304 (all-in for effective stack? Actually I have 32 left). Opponent called 240. So the main pot is: my 304 + opponent's 304 = 608? Wait, opponent called 240, but they had to match my 304 total. They already had 64 BB in, so they added 240 to make it 304. So pot is 304+304=608. That matches.\n\nSo now on river: Board is Js 4s 9s 5s Ks - all spades. I have 7h Kd. So I have a pair of Kings with 7 kicker. But board has 4 spades, and the Ks is on board. So"

So I don't have a flush. The board shows Ks, so my Kd gives me a pair of Kings. But there's a possible flush on board (4 spades). Actually 5 spades on board! Js, 4s, 9s, 5s, Ks - all five cards are spades. That's a flush on board for everyone. So my hand is just Kd with 7h kicker. Actually wait: if all five board cards are spades, then everyone has a flush - the board flush. So the best hand is the highest spade on board, which is Ks (King of spades). Since Ks is on board, everyone shares that. So the winning hand would be determined by the next highest card. Actually in Texas Hold'em, if there's a flush on board, players can only play the board. So everyone has a flush, and the flush is the board cards. Since all five are spades, the best possible hand is the board itself: Ks Js 9s 5s 4s. That's a King-high flush.\n\nMy hand: 7h Kd. I have Kd, but that's not a spade. So I'm playing the board: Ks Js 9s 5s 4s. My Kd doesn't help because it's not a spade. My 7h is not a spade. So I only have the board. So my hand is King-high flush using the board.\n\nOpponent could have a spade in their hand. If they have any spade, they have a flush too, but it would be the same board flush unless they have a spade higher than 7? Actually wait: if opponent has a spade, their flush would be: their spade + the four highest spades on board. Since board has Ks, Js, 9s, 5s, 4s. If opponent has As (Ace of spades), their flush would be As Ks Js 9s 5s - Ace-high flush, which beats my King-high flush (board). If opponent has Qs, their flush would be Ks Qs Js 9s 5s - King-high flush with Q kicker, which beats my King-high flush with J kicker (board). Actually board is Ks Js 9s 5s 4s. If opponent has Qs, their best five would be Ks Qs Js 9s 5s (using their Qs and dropping the 4s). That's King-high with Q kicker vs my King-high with J kicker (board). So Qs beats board.\n\nIf opponent has Ts (10 of spades), their best five would be Ks Js Ts 9s 5s (dropping 4s). That's King-high with J kicker, same as board? Actually board: Ks Js 9s 5s 4s. With Ts: Ks Js Ts 9s 5s. Compare: Ks same, Js same, Ts vs 9s: Ts is higher than 9s, so Ts hand wins. Actually wait, need to compare all five cards: Board: K, J, 9, 5, 4. With Ts: K, J, T, 9, 5. So third card T vs 9: T wins. So Ts beats board.\n\nIf opponent has 8s, 7s, 6s, 3s, 2s - these are all lower than the lowest board spade (4s). Actually 8s is higher than 4s. Let's check: If opponent has 8s, their best five: Ks Js 9s 8s 5s (dropping 4s). That's K, J, 9, 8, 5 vs board's K, J, 9, 5, 4. Compare: K same, J same, 9 same, 8 vs 5: 8 wins? Actually fourth card: 8 vs 5: 8 wins. So 8s beats board.\n\nIf opponent has 7s: Ks Js 9s 7s 5s vs Ks Js 9s 5s 4s. Compare: K same, J same, 9 same, 7 vs 5: 7 wins. So 7s beats board.\n\nIf opponent has 6"

          "content": "Now I need to think about my decision. I'm on the river with board showing all spades: Js 4s 9s 5s Ks. I have 7h Kd. The board has a flush (all spades). My hand is just the board - King-high flush. Opponent checked to me. I can check or fold. Checking will go to showdown.\n\nI have only 32 chips left (0.5 BB). The pot is 608 chips. I'm already all-in preflop essentially (I have 32 chips left after my raise). Actually wait, I raised to 304 preflop, leaving me with 32 chips. So I have 32 chips behind. On river, I can check for free.\n\nGiven the board has all spades, if opponent has any spade in their hand, they beat me (since any spade gives them a better flush than the board). If opponent has no spade, we split the pot (both playing the board).\n\nFrom opponent's preflop calling range: They called my raise of 304 total. They had to call 240 more (since they already had 64 BB in). They have 263 chips total stack. So they called a significant raise. What hands would they call with? Possibly pairs, suited connectors, maybe Ace-x suited. They might have a spade in their hand.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've called preflop raises many times. Showdowns show they had hands like Td Qc, 2h Kd, 8c 8s, Qh 7c, 2d Kc. None of these are particularly strong hands. They called with Q7o, K2o, etc. So they call wide.\n\nThe board has Ks. I have Kd. If opponent has a King with no spade, we split. If opponent has a spade, they win. What's the probability they have a spade? There are 13 spades total. Board has 5 spades. My hand has 0 spades. So 8 spades left in deck. Opponent has 2 cards. Probability they have at least one spade is roughly 1 - (39/47 * 38/46) \u2248 1 - (0.83 * 0.826) \u2248 1 - 0.685 = 0.315 or 31.5%. Actually more precisely: 47 cards unknown (52 total - 5 board - 0 in my hand? Wait, I have 2 cards, so 52-5-2=45 unknown cards. 8 spades left. So probability opponent has at least one spade: 1 - (37/45 * 36/44) = 1 - (0.822 * 0.818) = 1 - 0.672 = 0.328 or 32.8%.\n\nSo about 2/3 of the time we split, 1/3 of the time I lose. If we split, I get half of 608 = 304 chips. I already have 304 in the pot. Actually the pot is 608, which is my 304 + opponent's 304. If we split, we each get back 304. So I break even on my investment. If I lose, I lose my 304.\n\nExpected value: 0.672 * 304 + 0.328 * 0 = 204.3 chips. I invested 304, so expected loss of about 100 chips. But wait, that's if we go to showdown. Actually if I check, we go to showdown. If I fold, I forfeit my claim to the pot. But I've already invested 304 chips. Folding now would give up any chance to win. Since I can check for free, I should check and hope to split. Folding would guarantee I lose my 304.\n\nActually let me think: The pot is 608. If we split, I get 304 back. That's what I already put in. So I break even. If I lose, I get 0. So expected value of checking is 0.672 * 304 + 0.328 * 0 = 204.3. My investment is 304, so expected loss is 99.7 chips.\n\nBut if I fold, I get 0 for sure. So checking has higher EV than folding (204.3 vs 0). So I should check.\n\nBut wait, there's also chance opponent is bluffing? No, they checked. They might have missed everything. But with this board, if they have no spade, they're just playing the board like me.\n\nActually, I should consider that opponent might have been slow-playing a flush. They checked flop, turn, river. If they had a spade, they might bet for value. But they checked"

Pot is 608 chips.\n\nI posted SB 32, opponent posted BB 64. I raised 304 preflop (all-in? Wait, my stack is 32 chips, but I raised 304? That doesn't make sense. Let me check: My stack is 32 chips, I posted SB 32, so I had 0 left. But then I raised 304? That seems impossible. Maybe the display is wrong or I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-read: \"Your Stack: 32 chips (0.5 BB)\". Actually, I think I have 32 chips total. I posted SB 32, so I'm all-in preflop. But then it says I raised 304. That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the stack display is at the river? Let me trace: Preflop: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 32. Seat 2 post_bb 64. Then I raise 304. But I only have 32 chips total. Unless I had more chips earlier and lost some? Let me check the pot size: 608 chips. That's consistent with: SB 32 + BB 64 + my raise 304 + opponent call 240? Actually opponent call 240. Let me calculate: SB 32, BB 64, my raise 304, opponent call 240. Total: 32+64+304+240 = 640? Actually 32+64=96, +304=400, +240=640. But pot is 608. Hmm.\n\nMaybe the raise 304 includes my SB? So I put in total 304, which includes my 32 SB plus 272 more? And opponent called 240, which is the difference between 304 and 64? Actually BB is 64, so to call my raise, opponent needs to put in 304-64=240. That matches.\n\nSo I effectively went all-in preflop with 32 chips? Wait, but I raised to 304 total. That means I had more than 32 chips. The stack display of 32 chips must be my current stack at river? But if I raised to 304 preflop, I would have put in 304 chips. That would be more than 32. So maybe the stack display is wrong, or I'm misreading.\n\nLet me think: I'm DeepSeek-V3.2 with 32 chips. That's 0.5 BB. I posted SB 32, so I'm all-in. But then I raised 304? That's impossible. Unless the stack is after posting SB? Actually, if I have 32 chips total, posting SB 32 leaves me with 0. So I can't raise. So the raise must have happened earlier when I had more chips. Maybe the stack display is my remaining stack after the preflop action? But then I would have negative chips.\n\nI think there's a misunderstanding. Let me look at the hand history: I'm seat 3, posted SB 32. Opponent seat 2 posted BB 64. Then I raised 304. That means I put in 304 total, which is 272 more than my SB. So I must have had at least 304 chips preflop. But now my stack is 32 chips. So maybe I lost chips in this hand? Or the stack display is my remaining stack after the raise? If I raised to 304, and started with X chips, then after raising I have X-304 left. But it says my stack is 32 chips. So X = 336 chips. That makes sense: I started with 336 chips, posted SB 32, raised to 304 total (put in 272 more), leaving me with 336-304=32 chips. Yes! That's it. So I have 32 chips left after the preflop raise.\n\nSo preflop: I raised to 304 (all-in for effective stack? Actually I have 32 left). Opponent called 240. So the main pot is: my 304 + opponent's 304 = 608? Wait, opponent called 240, but they had to match my 304 total. They already had 64 BB in, so they added 240 to make it 304. So pot is 304+304=608. That matches.\n\nSo now on river: Board is Js 4s 9s 5s Ks - all spades. I have 7h Kd. So I have a pair of Kings with 7 kicker. But board has 4 spades, and the Ks is on board. So",

I have 32 chips remaining. Opponent checked to me. I can check or fold. There's no bet to call, so I can't call. Only fold or check.\n\nMy hand: pair of Kings with 7 kicker, but board has flush (all spades). Actually all five board cards are spades, so the board itself is a flush. In Texas Hold'em, if there's a flush on board, players can only play the board cards for the flush. My Kd and 7h are not spades, so I'm playing the board: Ks Js 9s 5s 4s - a King-high flush.\n\nOpponent could have any spade in their hand to make a better flush. Even a low spade like 2s would give them: their spade + four highest board spades. For example with 2s: Ks Js 9s 5s 4s (same as board) - actually 2s is lower than 4s, so board cards are Ks Js 9s 5s 4s, opponent's best five would be Ks Js 9s 5s 4s (dropping 2s). So same as board. But with any spade higher than 4s, they have a better flush. Actually let's think: board has 4s, 5s, 9s, Js, Ks. Any spade higher than 4s would replace the 4s in their hand. So As, Ks (but Ks is on board), Qs, Ts, 8s, 7s, 6s, 5s (but 5s is on board), etc. Actually if they have 5s, that's on board already. If they have 6s: their best five would be Ks Js 9s 6s 5s (dropping 4s). That's better than board's Ks Js 9s 5s 4s because 6s > 4s.\n\nSo any spade 6s or higher (except 5s and Ks which are on board) gives them a better flush. 5s is on board, so having 5s doesn't help. Ks is on board. So only spades 6s, 7s, 8s, Ts, Qs, As would give them a better flush. Also Js, 9s, 4s are on board.\n\nWhat about 2s, 3s? 2s and 3s are lower than 4s, so they wouldn't replace any board card. Their best five would still be the board. So with 2s or 3s, we chop.\n\nBut opponent called my preflop raise. I raised to 304 chips preflop. What range would call? I should recall opponent actions. Let me use the recall tool.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to think about my decision. I'm on the river with board showing all spades: Js 4s 9s 5s Ks. I have 7h Kd. The board has a flush (all spades). My hand is just the board - King-high flush. Opponent checked to me. I can check or fold. Checking will go to showdown.\n\nI have only 32 chips left (0.5 BB). The pot is 608 chips. I'm already all-in preflop essentially (I have 32 chips left after my raise). Actually wait, I raised to 304 preflop, leaving me with 32 chips. So I have 32 chips behind. On river, I can check for free.\n\nGiven the board has all spades, if opponent has any spade in their hand, they beat me (since any spade gives them a better flush than the board). If opponent has no spade, we split the pot (both playing the board).\n\nFrom opponent's preflop calling range: They called my raise of 304 total. They had to call 240 more (since they already had 64 BB in). They have 263 chips total stack. So they called a significant raise. What hands would they call with? Possibly pairs, suited connectors, maybe Ace-x suited. They might have a spade in their hand.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've called preflop raises many times. Showdowns show they had hands like Td Qc, 2h Kd, 8c 8s, Qh 7c, 2d Kc. None of these are particularly strong hands. They called with Q7o, K2o, etc. So they call wide.\n\nThe board has Ks. I have Kd. If opponent has a King with no spade, we split. If opponent has a spade, they win. What's the probability they have a spade? There are 13 spades total. Board has 5 spades. My hand has 0 spades. So 8 spades left in deck. Opponent has 2 cards. Probability they have at least one spade is roughly 1 - (39/47 * 38/46) \u2248 1 - (0.83 * 0.826) \u2248 1 - 0.685 = 0.315 or 31.5%. Actually more precisely: 47 cards unknown (52 total - 5 board - 0 in my hand? Wait, I have 2 cards, so 52-5-2=45 unknown cards. 8 spades left. So probability opponent has at least one spade: 1 - (37/45 * 36/44) = 1 - (0.822 * 0.818) = 1 - 0.672 = 0.328 or 32.8%.\n\nSo about 2/3 of the time we split, 1/3 of the time I lose. If we split, I get half of 608 = 304 chips. I already have 304 in the pot. Actually the pot is 608, which is my 304 + opponent's 304. If we split, we each get back 304. So I break even on my investment. If I lose, I lose my 304.\n\nExpected value: 0.672 * 304 + 0.328 * 0 = 204.3 chips. I invested 304, so expected loss of about 100 chips. But wait, that's if we go to showdown. Actually if I check, we go to showdown. If I fold, I forfeit my claim to the pot. But I've already invested 304 chips. Folding now would give up any chance to win. Since I can check for free, I should check and hope to split. Folding would guarantee I lose my 304.\n\nActually let me think: The pot is 608. If we split, I get 304 back. That's what I already put in. So I break even. If I lose, I get 0. So expected value of checking is 0.672 * 304 + 0.328 * 0 = 204.3. My investment is 304, so expected loss is 99.7 chips.\n\nBut if I fold, I get 0 for sure. So checking has higher EV than folding (204.3 vs 0). So I should check.\n\nBut wait, there's also chance opponent is bluffing? No, they checked. They might have missed everything. But with this board, if they have no spade, they're just playing the board like me.\n\nActually, I should consider that opponent might have been slow-playing a flush. They checked flop, turn, river. If they had a spade, they might bet for value. But they checked",

          "content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with Qc6d, which is a weak hand. My stack is 272 chips (4.2 BB). The opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 535 total, which is a massive overbet - they started with only 32 chips (the SB) and are essentially going all-in with their remaining 503 chips (since they posted 32 SB, they have 503 more to make it 535 total). Actually, wait: seat 2 had 32 chips total? No, looking at the player list: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 32 chips\". That means they only had 32 chips total, and they posted SB of 32, so they're all-in with 0 left. Actually, they raised 535, but they only have 32 chips? That doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 32 chips\". And \"preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 32\". So they posted 32 as SB, leaving them with 0 chips. Then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 535\". How can they raise 535 if they only had 32 total? This must be a tournament situation where they're all-in. The raise amount of 535 is probably the total bet size including their SB, but they only have 32 chips total. Actually, looking at the pot: \"Pot: 599 chips\". Blinds are 32/64. I posted BB of 64. So pot should be 32+64=96. But pot is 599. That includes the raise. So opponent raised to 535 total, which is 503 more than the SB of 32. But they only have 32 chips? This is confusing.\n\nActually, maybe the chip count display is wrong, or they have more chips than shown. Let me think: If opponent has only 32 chips, they'd be all-in with any raise. The raise to 535 would be impossible unless they have at least 535 chips. So likely the chip count \"32 chips\" is incorrect or means something else.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide: fold or call. I have Q6o, which is terrible. The pot is 599, and I need to call 471. That's pot odds of 599:471, or about 1.27:1, meaning I need about 44% equity to call. Q6o has nowhere near that against any reasonable raising range.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've shown some loose hands: Q7o, K7s, K2o, 88, etc. They raise sometimes preflop. But still, Q6o is terrible.\n\nMy stack is 272 chips (4.2 BB). If I fold, I'll have 272 chips. If I call and lose, I'm out. If I call and win, I'll have about 272 + 599 = 871 chips? Actually, my stack is 272, I need to call 471 but I only have 272 total. So I'm all-in if I call. The amount to call is 471, but I only have 272 total, so I can only call my remaining 208? Wait, I have 272 total. I already posted BB of 64, so I have 208 left. I need to call 471 more, but I only have 208, so I'm all-in for my remaining 208. The pot would be: SB 32 + my BB 64 + my all-in 208 + opponent's raise? Actually, opponent raised to 535 total, which includes their SB 32, so they put in 503 more. But they might have me covered.\n\nActually, let me calculate: I have 272 total. I put in BB of 64, leaving 208. Opponent raised to 535 total from SB. The amount to call is 471 (535 - 64). But I only have 208 left, so I can only call 208. So effectively we're both all-in if I call.\n\nPot if I call: My 272 + opponent's 535? Actually, opponent's 535 includes their SB 32, so total from opponent is 535. From me: 272 total. Pot = 272 + 535 = 807 chips.\n\nMy equity needed: risk 208 to win 599? Actually, pot before my call is 599. I need to call 208. Pot odds: 599:208 = 2.88:1, meaning I need about 26% equity. That's better.\n\nBut still, Q6o vs likely raising range has maybe 30% against a very wide range? Let's estimate: Against top 50% of hands, Q6o has about 35% equity."

But still, Q6o is terrible.\n\nMy stack is 272 chips (4.2 BB). If I fold, I'll have 272 chips. If I call and lose, I'm out. If I call and win, I'll have about 272 + 599 = 871 chips? Actually, my stack is 272, I need to call 471 but I only have 272 total. So I'm all-in if I call. The amount to call is 471, but I only have 272 total, so I can only call my remaining 208? Wait, I have 272 total. I already posted BB of 64, so I have 208 left. I need to call 471 more, but I only have 208, so I'm all-in for my remaining 208. The pot would be: SB 32 + my BB 64 + my all-in 208 + opponent's raise? Actually, opponent raised to 535 total, which includes their SB 32, so they put in 503 more. But they might have me covered.\n\nActually, let me calculate: I have 272 total. I put in BB of 64, leaving 208. Opponent raised to 535 total from SB. The amount to call is 471 (535 - 64). But I only have 208 left, so I can only call 208. So effectively we're both all-in if I call.\n\nPot if I call: My 272 + opponent's 535? Actually, opponent's 535 includes their SB 32, so total from opponent is 535. From me: 272 total. Pot = 272 + 535 = 807 chips.\n\nMy equity needed: risk 208 to win 599? Actually, pot before my call is 599. I need to call 208. Pot odds: 599:208 = 2.88:1, meaning I need about 26% equity. That's better.\n\nBut still, Q6o vs likely raising range has maybe 30% against a very wide range? Let's estimate: Against top 50% of hands, Q6o has about 35% equity.",

Q6o against a random hand has about 50% equity. Against a reasonable SB raising range (maybe top 50%), it has about 35-40%. That's enough to call. But tournament considerations: I have 4.2 BB, which is very short. If I fold, I'll have 272 chips (4.2 BB) and be in BB next hand? Actually, next hand I'll be in SB? No, positions rotate. But I'm very short. This might be a good spot to gamble. SB is likely raising wide because they have position and I'm short. Q6o isn't great but has some equity. I should call. Let me check opponent tendencies first using tool, but I need to output JSON. Actually, I tried to use tool but got error about format. I'll just make decision based on math.",

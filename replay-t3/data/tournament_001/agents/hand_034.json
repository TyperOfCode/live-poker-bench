Not worth playing.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB (small blind), which is one of the worst positions. I'll be out of position post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: GPT-OSS-120B has been very tight - folding 8 out of 9 hands shown, with only 1 call. This means when they raise, they likely have a strong hand.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips into a pot that will be 26 chips (16 + 8 + 2 from SB). That's about 30% pot odds, which would require me to win about 30% of the time. With 9s 6c, I definitely don't have that equity.\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: I have 351 chips (87.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots, especially with such a weak hand.\n\n6. **Action**: There's a raise to 10 from GPT-OSS-120B. Given their tight image, this is likely a strong hand. My 9s 6c is crushed by their raising range.\n\nConclusion: This is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, I'm out of position, facing a raise from a tight player, and I have plenty of chips to wait for better spots.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have Qh5h, suited queen and 5. In BTN, facing SB 2, BB 4. Action: SB posted 2, BB posted 4. No raises yet. It's our turn, amount to call 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total). Stack 119, 29.8 BB. Hand is weak: Q5 suited is not great, but in BTN you could open raise to steal blinds. However opponents: seat1 Kimi-K2 (SB) and seat2 Kimi-K2 (BB) are same name? Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 is Kimi-K2. Both have some raise tendencies. From recall: Kimi-K2 preflop raises amounts: 6, 12, 18, 24. So they raise sometimes small amounts (3BB) or larger. They may be aggressive. As BB they posted 4; they could be defending. As SB they posted 2; they may be passive? Not sure.\n\nOur hand is not strong enough to call and see flop for cheap, but could raise to steal. However Q5 suited can make flush, but low equity vs 2 opponents. In BTN with 30 BB, you can open raise to about 2.5-3 BB (10-12 chips). Minimum raise is 8 (2BB). We could raise to 12 to apply pressure. But risk: if they both call or raise, we might be in trouble. But we have position, can fold if re-raised.\n\nGiven hand marginal, typical strategy: raise to about 2.5 BB (10 chips) to steal. If they call, we can see flop with decent position. If they raise, we can fold.\n\nThus action: raise to 10? Minimum raise is 8; raise to 10 is allowed? Yes raise to any amount >= min raise. So choose raise_to 10.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

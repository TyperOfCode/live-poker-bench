I have to act first preflop and will be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n**Stack Size**: I have 329 chips (41.1 BB). This is a medium stack. I need to be careful not to jeopardize my tournament life with marginal hands.\n\n**Opponents**: \n- Seat 2: 263 chips (short-medium stack)\n- Seat 3: 340 chips (posted SB, medium stack)\n- Seat 5: 47 chips (very short stack, posted BB)\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 12, so 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not relevant with such a weak hand.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With Q4o from UTG, this is an easy fold. I don't need to take risks with such a weak hand, especially when I have a healthy stack. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold decision based on basic poker fundamentals. Q4o is not a playable hand from UTG position.\n\nDecision: Fold",

The pot is 36 chips, and I need to call 20 chips. The minimum raise would be to 40 total.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from Seat 2: I see they raised to 24 in hand #56 as well, then folded on a later street. They've shown pocket 44 in a showdown. They seem to be playing a mix of hands - sometimes calling, sometimes raising.\n\nMy hand: Kd 5d is suited, which gives some potential for flush draws. However, K5 suited is not a strong hand, especially from the small blind facing a raise. The king is good, but the 5 is a weak kicker.\n\nPosition considerations: I'm out of position for the rest of the hand, which is a significant disadvantage. I'll have to act first on every street after the flop.\n\nStack sizes: \n- I have 340 chips (42.5 BB)\n- Seat 2 has 239 chips (29.9 BB) - they have a shorter stack\n- Seat 5 (BB) has only 47 chips (5.9 BB) and will likely fold\n\nPot odds: I need to call 20 to win 56 (current pot of 36 + my call of 20). That's about 35.7% pot odds. K5s vs a typical raising range doesn't have 35% equity, especially out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (42.5 BB) and should avoid marginal situations out of position. Seat 2 has a shorter stack (29.9 BB), so they might be more aggressive.\n\nGiven all this:\n1. Hand strength is weak - K5s is not a hand I want to play for a raise, especially out of position\n2. Position is terrible (SB)\n3. Opponent seems to be raising with a reasonable range\n4. Pot odds aren't great for this hand\n5. Better to preserve my stack for better spots\n\nI should fold. This is a marginal hand that will be difficult to play post-flop out of position. The suitedness isn't enough to justify calling here.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K5s is too weak to call a raise from SB out of position.

            "reasoning_content": "We have Qs7c in BB, 5.9 BB stack, facing a raise to 24 (8 big blind raise? Actually raise amount 24 total, meaning player raised 24 total, so amount to call 16). Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise total 40). Opponent seat 2 is Kimi-K2. Their raise history: they have raised 12 (small) and 24 in recent hands. So they may be opening wide? 24 is 3x BB (since BB is 8). That's a standard open size (3BB). In a 5.9 BB stack, we are short-stacked. Q7 offsuit is a weak hand. In BB, we could consider a shove if we think we are short enough. But we have 47 chips, which is about 5.9 BB. Minimum raise to 40, which would be a raise of 32 total (8 already posted). Actually we have posted 8 BB, call amount 16 to match 24 raise, making total 24. Minimum raise to 40 means raise total to 40, i.e., add 32 more (total 40). That would be a raise of 32, which is 4 BB more (since 8 BB is 8). Our stack 47, we could raise to 40, leaving 7 chips behind (i.e., we could go all-in for 47). But raising to 40 is allowed. Should we call 16? That would leave us 31 chips after call. But we would be out of position post-flop, with a weak hand. Likely best to fold. However with short stack maybe we could shove all-in (raise to 47) to try to steal blinds? But opponent just raised, not a blind steal. We are in BB, they raised from UTG? Actually seat 2 is early position (maybe UTG). Raising 24 suggests they have a decent hand. Q7 offsuit doesn't play well. So folding is standard.\n\nBut we could consider a 3-bet all-in to apply pressure, but with Q7 it's weak. Likely fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 8\u2660 8\u2665 - Pocket eights, a medium pocket pair. Strong in early position.\n\n**Position**: UTG (Under The Gun) - This is the worst position at the table since I'll act first on every street. I need to be more cautious.\n\n**Stack Size**: 369 chips (92.2 BB) - I have a very healthy stack, giving me flexibility.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (209 chips) - Short stack\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 (240 chips) - Medium stack\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (40 chips) - Very short stack (10 BB)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B (135 chips) - Short stack\n\n**Action**: I'm first to act after the blinds. I need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\n**Pot**: 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n\nLet me analyze the opponent tendencies from the recall:\n\n1. **DeepSeek-V3.2** (Seat 3): \n   - Hand 20: folded preflop\n   - Hand 21: folded to a raise\n   - Hand 22: called a raise from Kimi-K2, then check-folded to a river bet\n   - Seems tight and passive\n\n2. **MiniMax-M2** (Seat 4):\n   - Hand 20: folded preflop\n   - Hand 21: folded preflop\n   - Hand 22: folded preflop\n   - Very tight, plays few hands\n\n3. **GPT-OSS-120B** (Seat 5):\n   - Hand 20: folded BB\n   - Hand 21: raised to 8, then folded to a re-raise\n   - Hand 22: folded SB\n   - Seems to defend blinds sometimes but folds to pressure\n\n4. **Kimi-K2** (Seat 2):\n   - Hand 20: folded preflop\n   - Hand 21: re-raised to 24 after GPT-OSS raised to 8\n   - Hand 22: raised to 12, then checked flop/turn, bet river\n   - More aggressive, willing to raise and apply pressure\n\n**Analysis**:\n- I have pocket 8s from UTG. This is a decent hand but vulnerable in early position.\n- There are several short stacks at the table (Seats 4 and 5), which might make them more likely to shove with weaker hands.\n- The player in Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown aggression and could re-raise me.\n- From UTG, standard play would be to raise with pocket 8s to:\n  1. Build the pot with a strong hand\n  2. Isolate against fewer opponents\n  3. Take initiative\n\nHowever, I need to consider:\n- If I raise and get re-raised by the aggressive Seat 2, I'll be in a tough spot\n- The short stacks might shove, forcing me to fold or call off my chips\n- From UTG, I should play tighter\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight with pocket 8s and a big stack\n2. **Call (limp)**: Could be okay to see a cheap flop, but gives no information and lets many players in\n3. **Raise**: Standard play, but I need to size it appropriately\n\nGiven I have a big stack and pocket 8s are strong, I should raise. But I need to be prepared to fold to a re-raise from the aggressive Seat 2 or a shove from the short stacks.\n\nStandard raise size from UTG would be 3-4x BB = 12-16 chips.\n\nLet me go with a standard raise of 12 chips (3x BB). This:\n- Builds the pot with my strong hand\n- Gives me initiative\n- Doesn't commit too many chips if I face resistance\n- Is a standard sizing that doesn't give away information\n\nIf I face a re-raise, I can comfortably fold. If called, I'll have position disadvantage but can evaluate on the flop.",

This is a standard raise. Looking at opponent history:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised twice before (hands 15 and 20, both 6 chips). This 12 chip raise is larger.\n   - MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot (9 of last 10 hands)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been mostly folding but raised once in hand 21\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 12). I need to call 12 to win 30 (18+12). That's 2.5:1 pot odds, or 29% equity needed.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy 60 BB stack. Q9s is a speculative hand that plays well in position but is dominated by UTG raising ranges. UTG raises typically represent strong hands (top 15-20% of hands).\n\n7. **Additional factors**: There are two players left to act (SB and BB). SB is very short-stacked (10 BB) and may shove. BB might also call or raise.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- Q9s has decent implied odds if I hit a flush or straight, but I'm out of position relative to the raiser.\n- UTG raises are typically strong, so I'm likely behind.\n- With 60 BB, I can afford to fold speculative hands.\n- The pot odds (29% equity needed) are borderline - Q9s vs a typical UTG range has about 30-35% equity, but that's close.\n\nHowever, my position on the button is excellent. If I call, I'll have position on everyone postflop. But the short stack in SB could shove, changing dynamics.\n\nGiven tournament preservation and that this is a marginal spot with a hand that can get me into trouble, I think folding is prudent. Better to wait for stronger spots in position.",

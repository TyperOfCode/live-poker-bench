The larger than usual raise (24 vs 12) suggests genuine strength\n2. However, I'm on the button with a decent hand\n3. The opponent folds to pressure often post-flop\n4. I have position advantage\n5. The call is cheap relative to my stack\n\nWith KJs on the button, I have good implied odds. The opponent's tendency to fold post-flop combined with my position makes this a profitable call. I could also consider a 3-bet to take control, but given their larger raise size, calling seems safer and more profitable given their post-flop tendencies.",

The board is extremely coordinated with 3 diamonds. Even though I have two pair, I'm very vulnerable to:\n1. Any diamond (flush)\n2. Qt (straight)\n3. AQ or QJ (straight)\n4. AA, KK, JJ (sets)\n\nWith the board being so wet and connected, and facing no bet on the flop (I can check), I should be cautious. This is a classic spot where checking is the right play because:\n1. I don't want to build a big pot with a vulnerable two pair\n2. If my opponent has a flush or straight, I want to keep the pot small\n3. If they have a weaker hand, they might bluff or value bet thinner\n4. I need to see the turn card to get more information\n\nChecking here is the standard play.

The opponent bet less than half pot (40 into 92), which could be:\n1. A value bet with a made flush or trips\n2. A semi-bluff with a strong draw\n3. A continuation bet with a weaker hand\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive tendencies and the fact that they raised preflop, they could have:\n- An Ace (trips)\n- Two diamonds (made flush)\n- A strong draw\n- A pair like QQ or TT\n\nSince I don't have any diamond in my hand and the flush is already there, I'm very vulnerable. However, I do have top two pair which is strong. \n\nThe pot odds are decent (3.3:1), but I'm not sure I'm ahead here. If I call, I'll have to face another bet on the turn or river.\n\nGiven my stack size (42.6 BB), I have room to play, but this is a tournament and preservation matters.\n\nI think the best play here is to **fold**. The board is too coordinated, I have no redraws to a flush, and many hands beat me. The opponent's aggression suggests they likely have something strong here.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I have top two pair on a board where I could be drawing dead to a flush. But the opponent only bet 40 into 92, which is less than half pot. This could be a value bet sizing with trips or a made flush, or it could be a smaller bet with a draw.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's pattern, they bet 18 into an unknown pot on hand 36, and 20 on hand 40. This 40 chip bet into 92 is proportionally larger than their previous bets.\n\nGiven that I have no diamond and the flush is already there, and there are straight possibilities, I think this is a fold.

Their raise amounts vary: 6 (min-raise), 12, 18, 24. They raised to 24 in hand #21. They have shown down Tc 7d in hand #30, which suggests they might raise with marginal hands.\n\nSeat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is in the BB and hasn't acted yet. They also raise frequently preflop (9 times). They showed KK in hand #9.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\nK4o is a weak hand. King-high with a weak kicker. It's not suited, so no flush potential. The hand plays poorly postflop unless we hit a king, and even then we have kicker issues. In position on the button, we have some advantage, but the hand is too weak to call a 3x raise.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 35.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. Seat 5 (SB) has only 87 chips (10.9 BB) and is short-stacked. Seat 2 (raiser) has 227 chips (28.4 BB). Seat 1 (BB) has 357 chips (44.6 BB).\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI should preserve my stack with weak hands. K4o is a clear fold against a raise. Even with position, the hand doesn't have enough equity or implied odds to justify calling 24 chips (8.5% of my stack).\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 36, need to call 24. Pot odds: 24/(36+24) = 24/60 = 40%. We need >40% equity to call. K4o vs a typical raising range has maybe 30-35% equity at best.\n\n**Decision:**\nClear fold. The hand is too weak, and we're not getting good enough pot odds. Better to wait for a stronger spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K4o is too weak to call a 3x raise from early position.

Player in seat2 (UTG? Not sure) raised to 24 (so 24 total, meaning raise of 16 over big blind). So amount to call is 20 (since we already posted 8). Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise total to 40). Need to consider hand strength: 7c Tc off-suit, not great. In BB, short stack ~11 BB. Raise from early position (seat2) suggests strength. 7T is marginal. With 11 BB, could consider a shove if hand decent. But 7T is not a shoving hand from early position, especially against a raise of 24 (3 BB). However, we are short, but not that short. Call would leave us with 67 chips, still 8.4 BB. Could we fold? Likely fold, as 7T offsuit is not good enough to call a raise from early position with short stack. Could we raise? Not advisable; raising would be a 3-bet to 40 (i.e., additional 20). That is a big commitment. Not good.\n\nThus fold. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

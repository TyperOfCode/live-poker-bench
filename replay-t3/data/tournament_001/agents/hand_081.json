            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 7s 5s (suited connectors)\n**Position:** Button (great position)\n**Stack:** 465 chips (14.5 BB) - I'm the big stack at the table\n**Blinds:** 16/32\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): 250 chips (7.8 BB) - Kimi-K2\n- Seat 3 (BB): 204 chips (6.4 BB) - DeepSeek-V3.2\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recalled data:\n\n**Kimi-K2 (Seat 2):**\n- Has shown aggression preflop with raises of 40, 48, and even a huge 234 chips in hand 79\n- Has also folded preflop in hands 74 and 78\n- Showed down KK in hand 72 (very strong hand)\n- Generally appears to be active and aggressive\n\n**DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3):**\n- Much more conservative\n- Has folded preflop in hands 75, 77, 79, and 80\n- Only raised preflop once (122 chips in hand 76)\n- Generally folds to pressure\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** 7s5s is a speculative hand. It's suited and connected, giving it potential for flushes and straights.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the Button - the best position postflop. I'll act last on all streets.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes:** I'm the big stack with 14.5 BB. Both opponents have <8 BB, making them short-stacked. This is important - they may be looking to get their money in.\n\n4. **Tournament Consideration:** With 14.5 BB, I'm not desperate, but I'm not deep either. I should be looking to accumulate chips, but also preserve my stack.\n\n5. **Opponent Stacks:** Both opponents are in the danger zone with <10 BB. They may be willing to shove with a wide range.\n\n6. **Action:** I have the option to call 32 or raise to at least 64.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that:\n- Both opponents are short-stacked and may shove\n- My hand is speculative and doesn't play well against all-in ranges\n- I have position\n- I want to see a flop cheaply with my suited connector\n\nI think the best play is to **call**. Raising might induce shoves from short stacks, and 7s5s doesn't want to get all-in preflop. I want to see a flop in position with a hand that can make strong disguised hands (straights, flushes).\n\nIf I hit the flop hard, I can extract value from the short stacks. If I miss, I can easily fold.\n\nPot odds: I'm calling 32 to win 48, which is 1.5:1. This is fine for a speculative hand in position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Calling with 7s5s in position.

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with Ac Ks, which is a very strong starting hand. My stack is 204 chips (6.4 BB). The pot is 314 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted SB 16, I posted BB 32, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called 32, then Seat 2 raised to 250 total (which means they raised 234 more from their SB position). Seat 2 only has 16 chips total? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check: Seat 2 has 16 chips, but they raised to 250? That would be impossible if they only have 16 chips. Actually, looking at the action: Seat 2 post_sb 16, then Seat 2 raise 250. But they only have 16 chips total? That seems contradictory. Maybe the stack sizes are before posting blinds? Or perhaps Seat 2 is all-in with their 16 chips? But the raise amount is 250, which is more than their stack. Let me re-read.\n\nPlayers at table:\nSeat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 433 chips\nSeat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\nSeat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 204 chips\n\nSeat 2 has 16 chips. They posted SB 16, so they're essentially all-in with their SB. Then they \"raise 250\"? That can't be right. Maybe the \"raise 250\" is the total amount they put in? But they only have 16 chips. Perhaps the system shows the total bet amount, not the additional? If they have 16 chips and posted SB 16, they can't raise more. Unless they're allowed to raise all-in for less than min raise? But the minimum raise to is 468, which is huge.\n\nWait, let me calculate: Pot is 314 chips. Amount to call is 218. Minimum raise to is 468. My stack is 204, so I can't even call the 218 - I only have 204 total! Actually, I have 204 chips total, and I already posted BB of 32, so I have 172 left. To call 218 more, I'd need to put in 218, but I only have 172 left. So I'm effectively all-in if I call. The amount to call is 218, but my remaining stack is 172. So I can call all-in for 172.\n\nLet me verify: My stack: 204 chips. I posted BB 32, so remaining stack: 172. Amount to call: 218. So I can call all-in for 172. That would put me all-in.\n\nSeat 2 has 16 chips. They posted SB 16, so they're all-in. Seat 1 has 433 chips and called 32 initially. Now facing Seat 2's raise... but Seat 2 only has 16 chips, so their raise can only be for their remaining 0? Something is off.\n\nMaybe the stack sizes are after posting blinds? Let me think: Seat 2 started with 16 chips, posted SB 16, now has 0. Their \"raise 250\" might be a misprint, or maybe it's the total pot? Actually, looking at the action: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 250\". That could mean they raised to 250 total. But they only have 16 chips. Unless the stack size shown is before posting? If Seat 2 had 266 chips, posted SB 16, now has 250, and raised to 250 total (i.e., put in 234 more). That would make sense: they have 250 after posting SB? But the listing says 16 chips. Hmm.\n\nLet me check my memory tools to understand opponent tendencies and past hands. I'll search for similar situations.",

Minimum raise to is 468, but I can't afford that.\n\nWait, let me check: Seat 2's raise: they posted SB 16, then raised to 250 total. That means they put in 234 more (250 total - 16 already). The amount to call for me is 218 (250 - my BB 32). But my stack is 204, so I can only call 204, which puts me all-in.\n\nI have Ac Ks, a premium hand. Seat 2 has only 16 chips? Actually they posted SB 16, then raised to 250. But their stack is listed as 16 chips. That seems contradictory. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\". But they posted SB 16, then raised to 250. That would require 234 more chips, but they only have 16 total? Something's off. Maybe the stack listing is at start of hand? Or maybe Seat 2 has 16 chips after posting SB? Actually if they had 16 chips, posted SB 16, they'd be all-in for the SB. But they raised to 250, which is impossible if they only have 16 chips.\n\nPerhaps the stack listing is current stack after actions? Let me think: Seat 2 started with some amount, posted SB 16, then raised. The raise to 250 might be all-in if they had less than 250. But the listing shows 16 chips. That might be their remaining stack after the raise? If they raised to 250 all-in, and had 266 total? Not sure.\n\nAnyway, I have AK suited (Ac Ks). This is a very strong hand, especially with my short stack of 6.4 BB. I'm facing a raise from Seat 2 who is in the SB. Seat 1 called initially but then Seat 2 raised. Seat 1 might call or fold.\n\nWith AK and only 6.4 BB, I should almost always go all-in. Even if Seat 2 has a premium pair, AK has good equity. And I'm getting pot odds: pot is 314 currently, I need to call 204 all-in. That's pot odds of 314:204, or about 1.54:1. I need about 39% equity to call. AK vs any pair except AA or KK has at least 45% equity. AK vs AA has 7%, vs KK has 30%. But vs random range, AK is strong.\n\nGiven my short stack, I should definitely go all-in. But wait, I can only call, not raise, because \"raise\" is not in legal actions. Legal actions are fold, call. So I can only call all-in (204 chips) or fold.\n\nI should call.

Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has only 16 chips and just raised 250? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check: Seat 2 has 16 chips total, posted SB of 16, so they're all-in. They raised 250 but only have 16? Actually, looking at the actions: Seat 2 post_sb 16, then Seat 3 (me) post_bb 32, Seat 1 call 32, then Seat 2 raise 250. But Seat 2 only has 16 chips total. This seems like a misrepresentation. Maybe Seat 2 has more chips? The table says Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips. So they have 16 chips total. They posted SB 16, so they're all-in. The raise to 250 is impossible. Perhaps it's a bug or the raise is actually all-in? The amount to call is 218, which is huge relative to my stack of 204. Actually, I have 204 chips total. I've already posted BB of 32, so I have 172 left. Amount to call is 218, but I only have 172 left? That doesn't add up. Let me calculate: My stack: 204 chips. I posted BB 32, so I have 172 left. Amount to call: 218. That means I need to put in 218 more, but I only have 172. So I would be all-in if I call. The minimum raise to 468 is impossible for me. So my options are fold or call all-in.\n\nBut wait, Seat 2 only has 16 chips. How can the amount to call be 218? Let me reconstruct: Pot is 314 chips. Blinds 16/32. Seat 2 (SB) posts 16. I (BB) post 32. Seat 1 calls 32. Then Seat 2 raises. But Seat 2 only has 16 total, so they can only raise to 16 total? Actually, they already put in 16 as SB, so they have 0 left. They can't raise. Something is off.\n\nMaybe the chip counts are wrong. Let me check the players: Seat 1 has 433, Seat 2 has 16, Seat 3 (me) 204, Seat 4 and 5 have 0 and folded. So Seat 2 indeed has only 16. Their raise of 250 must be a mistake. Perhaps the raise is actually all-in for their remaining stack? But they have no remaining stack after posting SB. Unless the chip count is after posting? They had 16, posted SB 16, now have 0. So they can't raise.\n\nI think there's a data error. But I need to make a decision. I have AKo, a premium hand. I'm facing a raise from a very short stack (16 chips). Actually, if Seat 2 has 16 total, and they raised, the maximum they can put in is 16. So the amount to call should be small. But the UI says amount to call: 218. That suggests Seat 2 actually has more chips. Maybe the chip count displayed is wrong. Let me use tools to recall opponent actions.",

They seem to be an active raiser.\n\nI have AcKs, which is a premium hand. Against a short stack all-in of 16 chips, this is an easy call. But wait, I need to call 218 chips, not 16. Actually, Seat 2 only has 16 chips total, so their raise to 250 is essentially an all-in for their remaining 16 chips. The pot is 314, and I need to call 218.

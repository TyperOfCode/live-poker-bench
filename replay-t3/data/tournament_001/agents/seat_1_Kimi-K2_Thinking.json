Fold - too tight, we have position and an ace\n2. Call - reasonable, see a flop in position\n3. Raise - also reasonable, we can steal blinds or build pot with our hand\n\nWith no opponent history and being on the button, I think raising is the best play. A standard raise would be 3x the BB, which is 6 chips total. Since minimum raise is 4, we can raise to 6.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The minimum raise to is 4, which means total amount to put in. Since the BB is 2, a minimum raise would be to 4 total (2 more). A standard 3x raise would be to 6 total.\n\nGiven we have no reads on opponents and are on the button with A6o, I think a standard raise to 6 (3x BB) is appropriate.

Let me think about this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A6s is a marginal hand, especially facing 3-bets. It's dominated by many hands (AK, AQ, AJ, AT, A9, A8, A7). The suitedness helps but it's still weak.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is good position, but I'm facing aggression from both blinds.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: No history available, so I have to assume standard play.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is currently 69 chips, I need to call 39, so I'm getting about 1.77:1 odds. This isn't great for a marginal hand.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 97 BB, I'm in decent shape.

Even against two random hands, Q2o only has about 35% equity, but against actual raising ranges it's much worse (likely 20-25% at best).\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** I have no data on these specific opponents yet since the search returned no results.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** \n- It's early in the tournament (Hand #4)\n- I have a healthy stack\n- There's already significant aggression (3-bet to 12)\n- I'm out of position\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. Q2o is a trash hand, I'm out of position, facing a 3-bet, and the implied odds are terrible. Even if I hit a Q, I'll often be dominated, and if I hit a 2, I'll rarely get paid off.

It's suited but not connected (gap of 3 cards)\n- It's a \"trouble hand\" - often dominated by better tens or dominated by overcards\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is excellent position, last to act post-flop\n**Stack**: 191 chips (95.5 BB) - Healthy stack\n**Blinds**: 1/2\n**Pot**: 3 chips\n**Amount to call**: 2 chips\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - Based on history, they've been folding a lot (folded in hands 3, 4, 5), called once, and raised once then folded. Seems somewhat tight.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - More aggressive, has raised multiple times (hands 1, 3), but also folded recently (hands 4, 5). Mixed strategy.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Weak. 7-T offsuit is not a strong starting hand. It's easily dominated by T-J, T-Q, T-K, T-A, and any pair.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is great, but with a weak hand like this, position advantage is limited unless we hit a very specific flop.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: We're getting 1.5:1 pot odds (calling 2 to win 3). This is not great for a hand this weak.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - SB seems to be playing somewhat tight recently (folded 3 out of last 4 hands)\n   - BB is more aggressive but has also folded recently\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 95.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots like this. I should preserve my chips for better situations.\n\n6. **Implied odds**: Very low. If I hit a T, I could be dominated. If I hit a 7, it's rarely good. The only good scenario is hitting two pair or a straight, which is very unlikely.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This hand is too weak to play from any position, even on the button. The pot odds aren't good enough, and we risk being dominated even when we hit. Let's wait for a better spot.",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- **Cards:** 8s 8d - Pocket 8s, a medium pocket pair\n- **Position:** UTG (Under the Gun) - Worst position, will act first post-flop\n- **Stack:** 191 chips (95.5 BB) - Healthy stack\n- **Action:** Facing a 2 chip call from the big blind\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** Pocket 8s is a medium-strength hand. It's strong preflop but vulnerable to overcards.\n2. **Position:** UTG is the worst position. I'll be out of position against everyone.\n3. **Stack Size:** With 95.5 BB, I have room to play, but tournament considerations matter.\n4. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the recall, I see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has been calling and betting small amounts\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) made a raise in hand #5\n   - Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) made a raise in hand #7\n\n**Strategic Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Too conservative. Pocket 8s is too strong to fold UTG with this stack.\n2. **Call:** Passive play, lets me see flop cheaply but with no initiative.\n3. **Raise:** Standard play. I should raise to:\n   - Build the pot when I likely have the best hand\n   - Get value from worse hands\n   - Define opponent ranges\n   - Take control of the hand\n\n**Raise Sizing:** Standard UTG raise is 3-4x the big blind. With 2 BB blind, I should raise to 6-8 chips. Given it's a tournament and I want to keep the pot manageable from early position, I'll go with 3x = 6 chips.\n\n**Conclusion:** Raise to 6 chips. This is a standard, solid play with pocket 8s from early position.",

This is a premium hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is an early position but I'm closing the preflop action.\n\n3. **Opponent action**: MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4 raised to 4. Looking at their history:\n   - They've been relatively tight, folding many hands preflop\n   - They made a similar small raise in Hand #4 (raise to 4, then re-raised to 20)\n   - In Hand #4 they showed aggression postflop with bets on flop and turn\n   - They called in Hand #5 but with small bets postflop\n   - Overall, they seem to play relatively conservatively but can be aggressive\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 7 chips (1 from SB, 2 from BB, 4 from raiser). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop, which gives me great pot odds.\n\n5. **Stack sizes**: I have 192 chips (96 BB), which is a healthy stack. MiniMax-M2 has 239 chips, so they're also deep-stacked.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With pocket Kings, I want to build the pot and extract value. I don't want to just call and let them see a cheap flop with speculative hands.\n\nGiven I have pocket Kings against a player who has shown they can raise but also folds frequently, I should:\n- Definitely not fold\n- Calling is too weak with KK - I want to build the pot\n- Raising is the correct play to:\n  - Extract value from weaker hands\n  - Define their hand range\n  - Take control of the hand\n\nThe minimum raise is to 6 chips (total), which is only a min-raise. With KK, I should make a more substantial raise. A standard raise would be 3x their raise (12 chips) or more. Given I'm out of position, I might want to raise even larger, perhaps 15-20 chips total.\n\nLet me make a solid raise to build the pot and protect my hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- Hand 1: Folded preflop on BTN\n- Hand 2: Checked in BB, then folded to flop bet\n- Hand 3: Folded UTG\n- Hand 4: Raised from BB, then made multiple bets postflop and won\n- Hand 5: Called from SB, then bet twice postflop and won\n- Hand 6: Folded on BTN\n- Hand 7: Folded in CO\n- Hand 8: Folded UTG\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems like a tight-aggressive player. They don't play many hands (folded most preflop), but when they do play, they tend to be aggressive with bets and raises. They 3-bet me here from 16 to 28 (a min-raise), which could indicate strength but could also be a re-steal attempt.\n\nWith pocket Kings in the BB, I have a premium hand. The action:\n- MiniMax-M2 raised to 4 (2x BB, a small raise)\n- I 3-bet to 16 (4x their raise)\n- They 4-bet to 28 (min-raise)\n\nI need to decide whether to call, raise, or fold. Folding is out of the question with KK. Calling would be 12 more chips. Raising would be at least 40 total (minimum raise).\n\nLet me think about stack sizes:\n- Me: 178 chips\n- MiniMax-M2: 215 chips\n\nPot is currently 45 chips. If I call, pot becomes 57. If I raise to 40, that's putting in 24 more than calling.\n\nWith KK, I should generally be happy to get all the chips in preflop, especially against a player who can be aggressive. However, I should consider:\n1. This is a tournament, so stack preservation matters\n2. MiniMax-M2 is tight, so their 4-bet range is likely very strong (AA, KK, maybe QQ or AK)\n3. If they have AA, I'm in bad shape\n4. If they have QQ or AK, I'm in great shape\n\nGiven that I have position (I'm BB, they're BTN/CO), and I have a premium hand, I think I should re-raise to put pressure on them. A 5-bet would show tremendous strength.\n\nLet me calculate: minimum raise to 40 means I put in 40 total. The pot would be 45 + 24 (my additional raise) = 69 if they call.\n\nActually, wait. Let me re-read the action:\n- Preflop: Seat 4 (MiniMax) raised to 4\n\n\n- I raised to 16\n- They raised to 28\n\nI'm facing a 12 chip call to see a flop. The 40 chip raise represents a significant escalation in the hand's intensity. This move would clearly communicate my hand's strength and potentially force a difficult decision for MiniMax-M2. The 40 chip raise is a strategic play that puts maximum pressure on my opponent while protecting my premium hand.\n\nThe total pot calculation reveals the potential impact: a 40 chip raise would create a 69 chip pot, with me investing 40 chips. This represents a substantial commitment that could define the tournament's progression.\n\nI'm carefully weighing the implications of a 5-bet, considering the strategic nuances of tournament poker and the potential range of my opponent's hand.\n\nWith a strong pocket pair, I'm leaning towards an aggressive re-raise. My stack size allows for a substantial 5-bet that could pressure my opponent, especially given their positional disadvantage. The key is balancing strength with strategic flexibility, potentially extracting value while maintaining tournament viability.\n\nThe potential scenarios range from dominating weaker pairs to facing a challenging matchup against premium hands. My tactical approach needs to maximize potential winnings while minimizing risk.\n\nA calculated 5-bet around 55-60 chips seems optimal - substantial enough to signal serious intent, yet preserving enough stack depth for post-flop maneuvering. This sizing puts significant pressure on my opponent while keeping my tournament life intact.\n\nThe key is extracting maximum value from my premium hand without overcommitting. By raising to 58, I force a critical decision: they'll need to commit 30 chips to continue, with a pot that will swell to 87 chips pre-flop. This strategic sizing creates a compelling scenario where they must either fold or risk a substantial portion of their stack.\n\nMy position and stack depth provide flexibility. I'm setting up a scenario where I can potentially dominate the hand's trajectory, regardless of whether they call or fold. The calculated raise balances aggression with prudent risk management.",

They raised to 4 (a min-raise), then folded to my 3-bet of 16, but now they're 4-betting to 28. This is interesting - they seem to be playing back at my 3-bet.\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n- Hand 4: They raised preflop 20, then bet on flop and turn (showing aggression)\n- Hands 5: Called and bet small amounts\n- Hands 6, 7, 8: Folded preflop\n\nSo MiniMax-M2 is selective but capable of aggression. Their 4-bet to 28 from 16 suggests strength, but could also be a move to test my 3-bet.\n\nWith pocket Kings (KK), this is a premium hand. The only hand that beats me preflop is AA. Given:\n1. My hand strength: KK is the 2nd best starting hand\n2. Position: I'm in BB, which is disadvantageous post-flop but fine pre-flop\n3. Stack size: 178 chips (89 BB) - healthy stack\n4. Opponent's raise: 4-bet to 28 suggests strength but could be AK, QQ, JJ testing me\n5. Pot size: Already 45 chips, calling 12 to win 45 = 3.75:1 pot odds\n\nI should re-raise (5-bet) to apply pressure. Since minimum raise is 40, I need to go to at least 40 total. I should make it around 58-60 total to give them a tough decision.\n\nA 5-bet to 58 would be:\n- 30 more for them to call (28 to 58)\n- Pot would be 103 if they call\n- This puts pressure on them while still leaving me with 120 chips if I have to fold later\n\nKK is too strong to just call here.

I have Kc Ks, which means I flopped a set of Kings! The board shows one King (Kh), so I have trips, not a full set. Wait, let me re-read: Kc Ks means I have two Kings in my hand. The board shows Js Kh 4d, which includes one King (Kh). So I have three Kings total: Kc Ks in my hand plus Kh on the board. That's a set (three of a kind).\n\n**My hand:** Set of Kings (trip Kings)\n**Board:** Js Kh 4d\n\nThis is an extremely strong hand. I have trips with the best possible trips. The board is relatively dry - no obvious straight draws or flush draws. The only potential draws are:\n- Someone could have a gutshot straight draw if they have Qx (Qx would make a straight possible if a Ten comes, but it's not very likely)\n- Someone could have a backdoor flush draw if they have suited connectors in clubs or spades, but the board shows only one club (Js) and one spade (4d actually - wait, 4d is diamonds, not spades). Let me check the suits: Js is spades, Kh is hearts, 4d is diamonds. So there are two spades on board (Js and... wait, Js is spades, but I only have one spade on board. Actually, Js is spades, Kh is hearts, 4d is diamonds. So only one spade on board. So backdoor flush draws are minimal.\n\nThe preflop action suggests MiniMax-M2 has a very strong hand. They 4-bet to 28 after I 3-bet to 16, then called my 5-bet to 58. This indicates they likely have:\n- Pocket Aces (AA)\n- Pocket Queens (QQ)\n- Pocket Jacks (JJ)\n- Ace-King (AK)\n- Possibly a bluff with suited connectors, but less likely given the 4-bet sizing\n\nGiven the board texture and the preflop action, my opponent likely has:\n- If they have JJ: They flopped a set of Jacks (lower set than mine)\n- If they have QQ: They have an overpair\n- If they have AA: They have an overpair (but I beat them now)\n- If they have AK: They have top pair top kicker\n- If they have something like AJ: They have top pair\n\nThe pot is 117 chips. I have 136 chips left. If I check, I risk giving a free card. If I bet, I can extract value from all the strong hands my opponent likely has.\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall_opponent_actions:**\nI have data on MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) from previous hands. Let me review their patterns:\n\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 1: Preflop fold\n- Hand 2: Preflop check, flop fold\n- Hand 3: Preflop fold\n- Hand 4: Preflop raise 4, raise 20, flop bet 18, turn bet 18\n- Hand "

          "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket Kings and flopped a set on a board of Js Kh 4d. I have 136 chips left and the pot is 117. The opponent is MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4, who showed significant preflop aggression (4-betting to 28 and calling my 5-bet to 58), indicating a very strong hand like AA, QQ, JJ, or AK.\n\nWith a set of Kings on a relatively dry board, I want to extract maximum value. Since it's my turn to act and I can check, I need to decide between checking (to potentially induce a bet or trap) or betting for value.\n\nGiven the opponent's preflop aggression and my strong hand, I should bet for value. The minimum raise is 30, but I need to consider what sizing would be appropriate. Since the pot is 117, a standard value bet would be around 40-60 chips (1/3 to 1/2 pot). \n\nHowever, I notice the minimum raise is 30, which is quite small relative to the pot (117). I could raise to 30, but that might be too small to extract maximum value. Let me consider a larger raise.\n\nLooking at my stack of 136 and pot of 117, I could make a substantial bet. A pot-sized bet would be 117, but that might scare away worse hands. \n\nGiven the opponent's strong preflop action, they likely have an overpair or top pair. I want to extract value while also protecting against potential straight or flush draws (though the board is quite dry).\n\nI'll make a value bet that's substantial but not pot-sized. Given the pot is 117 and I have 136 left, a raise to around 50-60 seems appropriate - it's less than half pot, which might encourage calls from hands like QQ, JJ, or AK.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the minimum raise of 30, this seems to be the system minimum. I can raise to any amount 30 or higher. I'll make a solid value bet of 50, which is about 43% of pot - a good size for extracting value from strong hands while not being so large that I only get called by better hands (though there are very few better hands than my set of Kings).\n\nWait, I should reconsider. With a set of Kings on this board, I'm ahead of almost everything except exactly JJ (which would be a set of Jacks). Since my opponent 4-bet preflop, JJ is definitely in their range. But they could also have AA, QQ, AK, etc.\n\nGiven that I have 136 chips left and pot is 117, I could also consider going all-in to maximize pressure and value. But that might be too aggressive and could fold out hands like QQ or AK that might call a smaller bet.\n\nLet me make a standard value bet. I'll raise to 50, which is a reasonable size that gives good odds for opponent to call with many hands I'm ahead of.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me recalculate the stack sizes and action more carefully:\n\nStarting stacks:\n- Me (Seat 1): 86 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): 85 chips\n\nPreflop action:\n- I post BB 2 chips \u2192 84 chips left\n- Seat 4 raises to 4\n- I raise to 16 \u2192 put in 14 more (16 total), 70 chips left\n- Seat 4 raises to 28\n- I raise to 58 \u2192 put in 42 more (58 total), 28 chips left\n- Seat 4 calls 30 \u2192 puts in 30 more (58 total), 55 chips left\n\nFlop action:\n- Pot is 267 chips (this seems high, let me verify)\n- I bet 50 \u2192 but I only have 28 chips left!\n\nWait, the numbers don't add up. Let me re-read the hand history...\n\nActually, looking at the hand history again, it says:\n- \"Your Stack: 86 chips (43.0 BB)\"\n- Blinds are 1/2, so 86 chips = 43 BB is correct\n\nPreflop:\n- I post BB 2 chips\n- Seat 4 raises to 4 (so +2 chips)\n- I raise to 16 (so +14 chips)\n- Seat 4 raises to 28 (so +24 chips)  \n- I raise to 58 (so +42 chips)\n- Seat 4 calls 30 (so +30 chips)\n\nIf I raised to 58 total, that means I put in 58 chips. Starting with 86, I'd have 28 left.\n\nBut then on the flop it says \"Seat 1 bet 50\" which I can't do with only 28 chips.\n\nI think the notation might be different. When it says \"raise 16\", it might mean \"raise by 16\" not \"raise to 16\". Let me reconsider:\n\nIf \"raise 16\" means raise by 16:\n- I post BB 2 \u2192 84 left\n- Seat 4 raises by 4 (to 6 total) \u2192 but that doesn't make sense with the earlier notation\n\n\n- I raise by 16 (to 22 total) \u2192 put in 20 more, 64 left\n- Seat 4 raises by 28 (to 50 total) \u2192 put in 28 more, 27 left\n- I raise by 58 (to 108 total) \u2192 put in 58 more, -31... no that doesn't work\n\nI'm seeing multiple inconsistencies in the chip calculations. The raise amounts don't align with my starting stack, and the pot size seems inflated. Something's not adding up in the hand history notation.\n\nIf \"raise 58\" means raise to 58:\n- I have 28 chips left after preflop\n- Flop: I bet 50 \u2192 This would be an illegal bet\n\nI can't make sense of these numbers. The hand history seems to have inconsistent chip tracking that's preventing me from accurately reconstructing the betting sequence.\n\nThe key issue appears to be ambiguous notation around raise amounts. The pot size of 267 suggests a specific betting progression, but the individual raise descriptions don't clearly indicate whether they're total bets or incremental raises. This ambiguity makes precise chip calculation impossible without additional context.\n\nMy current focus is determining the most logical action given the unclear betting structure. The hand's progression suggests significant pre-flop action, with multiple raises indicating strong hand ranges from both players.\n\nI'm leaning towards interpreting the raises as total amounts, which would mean I have 28 chips remaining. This interpretation makes the subsequent 50-chip flop bet problematic, potentially indicating an all-in scenario or a notation error in the hand history.\n\nThe critical decision point involves calling 50 chips in a 267-chip pot with a strong hand, which mathematically seems like a clear call due to favorable pot odds. The hand's complexity stems from the unclear betting notation and potential tracking inconsistencies.\n\nMy set of Kings provides a powerful hand, and the pot size relative to the call amount suggests an easy decision to continue, despite the confusing chip count details.",

The pot is 317 chips and my stack is 36 chips.

Pot = 116\n\nFlop:\n- I bet 50\n- Seat 4 raises to 100\n- I call 50\n\nSo on flop: I put in 50 more (total 108), Seat 4 put in 50 more (total 108). Pot = 116 + 100 = 216\n\nWait, but it says pot is 317 now. Let me recalculate:\n- Preflop: 58 (me) + 58 (Seat 4) + 1 (SB) + 2 (BB) = 119\n- Flop: I bet 50, Seat 4 raised to 100, I called 50\n  - This means I added 50, Seat 4 added 100\n  - Pot = 119 + 150 = 269\n\nHmm, the pot shows 317. Let me think again. Maybe the numbers are cumulative totals, not additional amounts.\n\nLooking at the actions:\n- preflop: Seat 4 raise 4 (so 4 total)\n\n\n- preflop: Seat 1 raise 16 (so 16 total)\n- preflop: Seat 4 raise 28 (so 28 total)\n- preflop: Seat 1 raise 58 (so 58 total)\n- preflop: Seat 4 call 30 (this is ambiguous - call 30 more to match 58?)\n\nI'm tracking the escalating raises and trying to understand the exact chip movements. The preflop action shows multiple raises, with each player increasing their total contribution. The call from Seat 4 suggests they're matching a previous raise, but the exact amount is unclear. The pot size of 317 doesn't align with my current calculations, indicating I might be misinterpreting the betting sequence.\n\nThe key details are my set of Kings on the flop, the 2s on the turn, and my short stack of 36 chips. With no bet to call, checking seems like the most prudent move, preserving my remaining chips while holding a strong hand.\n\nI'll carefully review the hand history to confirm my chip count and understand the precise betting sequence that led to this point.\n\nThe preflop betting went through multiple raises: I initially raised to 16, then re-raised to 58 when my opponent raised to 28. My opponent called, bringing my total preflop investment to 58 chips.\n\nOn the flop, I bet 50 chips, and when my opponent raised to 100, I called by adding another 50 chips. This means I've now invested 108 chips total (58 preflop + 50 flop call).\n\nStarting with 94 chips and now having 36 left confirms my calculations: 94 - 58 - 50 = 36 chips remaining.\n\nWith a pot of 317 chips and 36 chips left, I'm in a crucial tournament situation. My stack represents just 10.7% of the pot, which strongly suggests I should commit my remaining chips, especially holding a powerful set of Kings.\n\nI'll analyze potential opponent hands that could beat me: a straight seems unlikely, but a flush draw is possible with two spades on the board. I need to carefully consider my next move, weighing the strength of my hand against potential draws and tournament implications.\n\nChecking now allows me to control the pot size and potentially induce a bluff.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I have Kc Ks (pocket Kings)\n- Board: Js Kh 4d 2s\n- Pot: 367 chips\n- I have 36 chips left\n- MiniMax-M2 bet 50 on the turn\n- I need to call 50 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have a set of Kings (three of a kind) on a board of Js Kh 4d 2s. This is a very strong hand. The only hands that beat me are:\n- JJ (full house Jacks full of Kings)\n- 44 (set of 4s)\n- 22 (set of 2s)\n\n**Opponent tendencies (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the recall, MiniMax-M2 has been aggressive in early hands (hands 4-5) but has folded a lot recently (hands 6-8). They:\n- Raised preflop in hand 4 and 8 (this hand)\n- Made multiple raises in hand 4\n- Bet flop and turn in hands 4-5\n- Folded preflop in hands 6-8\n\n**Current action:**\n- Preflop: We had a raising war - they raised to 4, I raised to 16, they raised to 28, I raised to 58, they called 30\n- Flop: I bet 50, they raised to 100, I called 50\n- Turn: I checked, they bet 50\n\n**Key observations:**\n1. I have a monster hand (set of Kings)\n2. The board is relatively dry - no obvious straight or flush draws\n3. My opponent has shown aggression throughout this hand\n4. I only have 36 chips left, so I can't call 50 - I can only fold or go all-in\n\nWait, let me check the amounts again:\n- Preflop: I raised to 58 total, they called 30 (so they put in 58 total)\n- Flop: I bet 50, they raised to 100 (so they bet 100 total on flop)\n- Turn: they bet 50\n\nBut I only have 36 chips left. So I cannot call 50. My only options are fold or go all-in (which would be for 36 chips).\n\nActually, looking at the action more carefully:\n- Preflop: I raised to 58 total, meaning I put in 58 chips\n- Flop: I bet 50, then called 50 (so I put in 100 total on flop)\n- So I've put in 58 + 100 = 158 chips so far this hand\n- Starting stack was 194 chips\n- So I should have 194 - 158 = 36 chips left\n\nBut the amount to call is 50, which is more than my stack of 36. So I cannot call - I can only fold or go all-in for my remaining 36 chips.\n\nThis is a clear all-in situation. I have a set of Kings on a relatively safe board. The opponent could have:\n- A weaker hand they're bluffing with\n- Two pair (Jacks and something)\n- A lower set (4s or 2s)\n- A draw (but unlikely given the board)\n\nEven if they have JJ for a full house, I still have equity. But given the action, it's more likely they have a strong but second-best hand.\n\nSince I can't call 50 with only 36 chips, and I have a monster hand, I should go all-in.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My Hand**: 9c 5s - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and poorly connected.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position in poker.\n\n**Stack**: 387 chips (193.5 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Pot**: 3 chips (SB+BB)\n\n**Opponent**: Only the BB (Seat 2) is active. Let me review their tendencies:\n\nFrom the opponent actions I just recalled:\n- Seat 2 has folded preflop 7 out of 10 times (hands 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9)\n- Called once (hand 2) then folded on the flop\n- Raised once (hand 7) to 6 chips\n\nThis opponent appears to be tight, folding most hands preflop. They only played 3 out of 10 hands.\n\n**Current situation**:\n- Amount to call: 1 chip\n- I could call 1 chip to see if the BB folds or plays passively\n- I could raise to try to steal the blinds\n- I could fold this weak hand\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 9c 5s is trash. Very low equity against any reasonable range.\n2. **Position**: Being on the Button is great, but hand strength still matters.\n3. **Opponent**: Tight player in BB who folds a lot. Good target for a steal.\n4. **Pot odds**: Need to call 1 to win 3 (3:1 odds), but with this hand it's not worth it.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a big stack. Stealing blinds is fine, but I don't need to risk chips with garbage.\n\n**Decision**: While I could try to steal from the Button against a tight BB, 9c 5s is just too weak. Even if the BB folds 70% of the time, when they call or raise I'm in terrible shape. The risk/reward isn't there. \n\nI should fold this hand and wait for a better spot. With my stack size, I don't need to get involved with marginal situations.\n\nLet me double-check if there's any reason to play this... No, folding is clearly the best option here.",

Can make straights, flushes, and strong top pair hands.\n2. **Position**: On the button - huge advantage postflop\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: SB is very tight/passive, BB is capable of big bets but folds frequently\n4. **Stack sizes**: Very deep stacked, can afford to see flops with speculative hands\n5. **Tournament**: Early/mid stage, no pressure yet\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight for button with deep stack\n- **Call**: Reasonable, see a flop in position with a speculative hand\n- **Raise**: Could steal blinds from tight SB and BB who folds a lot. Standard raise to 6-8 chips would be good\n\nGiven the tightness of both opponents (SB folds 70%, BB has folded 7 of last 10 hands), a raise seems profitable here. I can likely take down the pot preflop, and if called, I have position and a playable hand.\n\nI'll raise to 8 chips (4x BB) to put pressure on the tight opponents.",

This represents about 60% of the pot, which is a standard sizing that applies pressure while keeping my risk low. The bet suggests I have a strong hand and forces my opponent to make a decision with their likely missed flop. If they call, I still have overcards and position to work with on later streets.",

Even with two overcards, I'm likely dominated or way behind. The gutshot to an 8 gives me 4 outs (about 16% equity on turn), but that's not enough given pot odds.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (184.5 BB)\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Preserve chips for better opportunities\n- Opponent is tight and showing strength - respect it\n\n**Decision: FOLD**\n\nI should fold here. I'm facing significant strength from a tight player, I missed the flop completely, and I don't have the right pot odds to chase my gutshot. This is a clear fold situation.",

I'd be calling 8 chips with poor equity (~30-35% vs typical raising ranges) and would be out of position post-flop. With 184.5 BB, I can wait for better spots.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Qc 5c (Queen of clubs, 5 of clubs) - This is a suited but weak hand. Q5s is not a strong starting hand, especially in early position. I'm in CO (Cutoff), which is late position, but this is still a marginal hand.\n\n**Stack**: 369 chips (184.5 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Position**: CO (Cutoff) - Good position, but there are players behind me (BTN and possibly blinds).\n\n**Action**: \n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 11 chips\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Let me check what I learned about GPT-OSS-120B from the recall. Looking at their actions:\n- They fold a lot preflop (hands 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 all folded)\n- They raised to 4 in hand 5 preflop\n- They called and folded on later streets in hand 5\n- They folded on turn in hand 4\n\nSo GPT-OSS-120B appears to be relatively tight, folding most hands preflop. The fact that they're raising now to 8 (which is 4x the BB) suggests they likely have a strong hand.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 to win 11 (already in pot) + 8 (their raise) = 19 chips. So 8/19 = ~42% pot odds needed.\n\n**Hand Equity**: Q5s against a typical raising range (like 88+, ATs+, KJs+, AJo+, KQo) has roughly 30-35% equity. This is worse than the pot odds I'm getting.\n\n**Position**: Even though I'm in CO, I still have players behind me who could 3-bet. And if I call, I'll be out of position against the raiser post-flop.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With a healthy stack of 184.5 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. \n\nThe hand's potential is severely limited. Suited connectors offer minimal upside with Q5s, and I'm likely dominated by stronger queen or higher card combinations. Facing a raise from a tight player in a multi-player scenario, the risk significantly outweighs any potential reward. Folding is the most prudent decision to protect my chip stack and wait for a more favorable opportunity.",

The small raise to 4 chips (2x the big blind) from a stack of 42 chips suggests this might be a standard opening, but could also be a weak hand trying to steal.\n\nMy hand: 5d 7c - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. Even in position this would be a fold, and I'm out of position in the BB.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 to win 7, so 3.5:1 pot odds. Even with these odds, 57o is just too weak.\n\nMy stack is healthy at 367 chips (183.5 BB), so no pressure to gamble.\n\nThe opponent has shown they can be aggressive post-flop (Hand #9), so even if I hit something like a pair of 5s or 7s, I could be easily dominated.\n\nDecision: Fold. This is an easy fold with a trash hand out of position.",

QTo offsuit is a marginal hand, especially from early position. But I'm on the BTN (Button), which is the best position.\n\n2. **Position**: BTN (Button) - This is excellent position. I'll act last on all postflop streets.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 366 chips (183 BB) - This is a healthy stack, deep.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - SB: Kimi-K2 with 178 chips (89 BB) - relatively short\n   - BB: Kimi-K2 with 178 chips? Wait, there's some confusion. Looking at the players:\n     - Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 366 chips (this is me)\n     - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n     - Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 256 chips (folded)\n     - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 49 chips (folded)\n     - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 147 chips (folded)\n   \n   Wait, I need to re-read. The table shows:\n   - Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 366 chips (this is me)\n   - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n   \n   Hmm, there are two players named \"Kimi-K2\". One is me with \"Thinking\" appended, and one is just \"Kimi-K2\". Let me assume:\n   - Seat 1 (me): BTN, 366 chips\n   - Seat 2: SB, 178 chips\n   - Seat 3: BB, but it says DeepSeek-V3.2 folded... wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me re-read the setup more carefully:\n\n\"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\" - so I'm in seat 1, BTN\n\n\"Players at table:\n  Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 366 chips\n  Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n  Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 256 chips (folded)\n  Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 49 chips (folded)\n  Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 147 chips (folded)\"\n\nSo:\n- Seat 1: Me (BTN) - 366 chips\n- Seat 2: SB - Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n- Seat 3: BB - DeepSeek-V3.2 - 256 chips (but it says folded, which is confusing because the actions show Seat 3 folded preflop)\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 49 chips (folded)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 147 chips (folded)\n\nWait, the actions show:\n- preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 1\n- preflop: Seat 2 post_bb 2\n- preflop: Seat 3 fold\n- preflop: Seat 4 fold\n- preflop: Seat 5 fold\n\nThis is confusing. If I'm Seat 1 on the BTN, why did I post SB? In a 5-handed game, the positions would be:\n- Seat 1: UTG\n- Seat 2: MP\n- Seat 3: CO\n- Seat 4: BTN\n- Seat 5: SB\n- Seat 1: BB\n\nBut it says \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\". Let me re-read...\n\nOh wait, I see the issue. The game is showing the actions that have already happened:\n- Seat 1 (me) posted SB 1\n- Seat 2 posted BB 2\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 4 folded\n- Seat 5 folded\n\nSo now the action is back to me (Seat 1) to complete the blind or raise. In this case, since everyone folded to me on the BTN, I only need to call 1 more chip (to make it 2 total, matching the BB).\n\nSo the situation is:\n- I'm on the BTN (Seat 1)\n- SB: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) - 178 chips\n- BB: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - 256 chips (but folded)\n- Actually wait, the actions say Seat 3 folded, which would be the BB folding... but that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me think differently.

          "reasoning_content": "  This is a preflop situation. Let me analyze:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ts Qd - This is QTo, which is a decent but not premium hand. It's suited (off-suit actually, wait - Ts Qd, so offsuit). Wait, let me check: Ts Qd means Ten of spades and Queen of diamonds - so it's offsuit. QTo offsuit is a marginal hand, especially from early position. But I'm on the BTN (Button), which is the best position.\n\n2. **Position**: BTN (Button) - This is excellent position. I'll act last on all postflop streets.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 366 chips (183 BB) - This is a healthy stack, deep.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - SB: Kimi-K2 with 178 chips (89 BB) - relatively short\n   - BB: Kimi-K2 with 178 chips? Wait, there's some confusion. Looking at the players:\n     - Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 366 chips (this is me)\n     - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n     - Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 256 chips (folded)\n     - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 49 chips (folded)\n     - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 147 chips (folded)\n   \n   Wait, I need to re-read. The table shows:\n   - Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 366 chips (this is me)\n   - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n   \n   Hmm, there are two players named \"Kimi-K2\". One is me with \"Thinking\" appended, and one is just \"Kimi-K2\". Let me assume:\n   - Seat 1 (me): BTN, 366 chips\n   - Seat 2: SB, 178 chips\n   - Seat 3: BB, but it says DeepSeek-V3.2 folded... wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me re-read the setup more carefully:\n\n\"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\" - so I'm in seat 1, BTN\n\n\"Players at table:\n  Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 366 chips\n  Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n  Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 256 chips (folded)\n  Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 49 chips (folded)\n  Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 147 chips (folded)\"\n\nSo:\n- Seat 1: Me (BTN) - 366 chips\n- Seat 2: SB - Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n- Seat 3: BB - DeepSeek-V3.2 - 256 chips (but it says folded, which is confusing because the actions show Seat 3 folded preflop)\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 49 chips (folded)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 147 chips (folded)\n\nWait, the actions show:\n- preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 1\n- preflop: Seat 2 post_bb 2\n- preflop: Seat 3 fold\n- preflop: Seat 4 fold\n- preflop: Seat 5 fold\n\nThis is confusing. If I'm Seat 1 on the BTN, why did I post SB? In a 5-handed game, the positions would be:\n- Seat 1: UTG\n- Seat 2: MP\n- Seat 3: CO\n- Seat 4: BTN\n- Seat 5: SB\n- Seat 1: BB\n\nBut it says \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\". Let me re-read...\n\nOh wait, I see the issue. The game is showing the actions that have already happened:\n- Seat 1 (me) posted SB 1\n- Seat 2 posted BB 2\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 4 folded\n- Seat 5 folded\n\nSo now the action is back to me (Seat 1) to complete the blind or raise. In this case, since everyone folded to me on the BTN, I only need to call 1 more chip (to make it 2 total, matching the BB).\n\nSo the situation is:\n- I'm on the BTN (Seat 1)\n- SB: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) - 178 chips\n- BB: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - 256 chips (but folded)\n- Actually wait, the actions say Seat 3 folded, which would be the BB folding... but that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me think differently.

Only raised once in hand #7. This suggests a very tight player who likely has a strong hand when they enter the pot.\n\n2. **Seat 3 (BB - DeepSeek-V3.2)**: This opponent has been more active. They've folded several times but also:\n   - Called a raise in hand #11\n   - Checked then raised on the flop in hand #11 (showing aggression)\n   - Raised preflop in hand #13 and bet the flop\n\n3. **My own play**: I've been very tight, playing only 2 out of 14 hands (14% win rate, but that's misleading since it's win rate not VPIP). Actually looking at my hands, I've folded most of the time and only played hands #11 and #10 where I raised with J9s on the button.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with QTo (offsuit)\n- Everyone folded to me\n- I need to call 1 chip to see the flop (pot is 3, I posted 1 as SB)\n- The SB (tight player) and BB (more aggressive player) are the only ones left\n\n**Analysis:**\n- QTo offsuit is a marginal hand, but I'm in the best position (BTN)\n- The SB is very tight (folds 90% of the time preflop), so if I raise, they might fold often\n- The BB is more aggressive and might defend their blind\n- Pot odds: I need to call 1 to win 3 (3:1 odds), which is good\n- With my deep stack (366 chips), I can afford to see a flop\n\n**Decision:** I should raise. Here's why:\n1. I'm in position on the BTN\n2. QTo is strong enough to raise against two players, especially when the SB is very tight\n3. I can likely take down the pot preflop or have position postflop\n4. A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 6 chips total (raising to 6)\n \nI'll make a strategic raise to 6 chips, leveraging my position and the tight nature of the small blind.

It's easily dominated by:\n- AQ, KQ, QJ, QT (all have me dominated)\n- Any pocket pair is ahead\n- Even hands like AJ, KJ are flipping/favored\n\nThe only reasonable action here is to fold. Calling would be a mistake because:\n1. The hand plays poorly postflop\n2. I'm out of position\n3. I could easily get squeezed by players behind\n4. If the short stack in BB shoves, I'd be in a tough spot\n\n\nI'll maintain a disciplined approach and preserve my tournament stack by folding this marginal hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: UTG (earliest position)\n- Cards: 3d 4d (suited connectors, but very low)\n- Stack: 369 chips (184.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- To call: 2 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 3d 4d is a very weak hand, especially from UTG\n- It's suited, which gives some flush potential, but it's low suited connectors\n- From early position, we should play very tight\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (from my searches):**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2: Seems to fold often preflop, occasionally raises (like hand 13 raised to 6)\n- MiniMax-M2: Can be aggressive (hand 14 raised to 4 from SB, hand 9 had a big confrontation)\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Occasionally raises (hand 12 raised to 8 from BB), but generally folds\n\n**Position and Tournament Considerations:**\n- UTG is the worst position - we have 4 players to act behind us\n- With a healthy stack of 184.5 BB, we don't need to take risks\n- The hand 3d 4d is simply too weak to play from UTG\n- We risk being raised and having to fold, losing 2 chips unnecessarily\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 3, we need to call 2\n- Getting 1.5:1 odds, but with this hand it's not relevant since it's so weak\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 3d 4d from UTG is not a playable hand in any standard strategy. We should preserve our chips for better opportunities, especially with our healthy stack size.\n\nThe suited nature and connector aspect don't compensate for:\n1. Very low card values\n2. UTG position\n3. Risk of being dominated by higher cards\n4. Tournament setting where chip preservation matters\n\nI should fold this hand.",

I act last on all post-flop streets.\n\n**Stack**: 367 chips (183.5 BB) - Healthy stack, plenty of room to play.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Small blind posted 1 chip\n- I posted big blind of 2 chips\n- Everyone folded to the small blind (GPT-OSS-120B)\n- SB just called for 1 chip to complete\n- Pot is 4 chips\n- It's back to me\n\n**Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B in SB\nFrom the recall data:\n- Very tight player - folded 7 out of 10 preflop actions\n- Only raised once (hand #12 for 8 chips)\n- Only called once (hand #13 for 4 chips)\n- When they called preflop in hand #13, they checked and folded on the flop\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is a very conservative player who likely has a strong hand when they enter pots. The fact they just called from SB (rather than raising) suggests they have a decent but not premium hand.\n\n**My decision**:\n- I have position\n- Pot odds: I can check and see a free flop with my marginal hand\n- Raising would be a steal attempt, but against a tight player who already showed interest, it's risky\n- 7\u2660 9\u2666 is not strong enough to raise for value\n- Checking is free and lets me see the flop with position\n\nI should check and see the flop for free.

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been very tight - folding preflop in most hands. They only played hands 12 and 13. In hand 12 they raised to 8, and in hand 13 they called 4 preflop, then checked and folded on the flop.\n\nNow on this flop of 5c 3h Th, I have 7s 9d. Let me analyze:\n\n**My hand:** 7s 9d - I have no pair, no draw. Just two overcards to the 5 and 3, but the 9 is below the T on board.\n\n**Board:** 5c 3h Th - Very dry board. Only possible draws are gutshots (like 4-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-J, J-Q) or backdoor flush draws. The T is the highest card.\n\n**Opponent:** Very tight player who just bet 2 into a pot of 6 on the flop. This is a small bet (1/3 pot). Given their tight nature, this could be:\n- A strong hand like a T (top pair)\n- A medium pair like 55 or 33 (sets)\n- Possibly just a continuation bet with air since I checked preflop\n\n**My situation:** \n- I have 367 chips, very healthy stack\n- Pot is 8 (6+2)\n- Need to call 2 to see turn\n- Getting 4:1 pot odds (8:2)\n- I have 6 outs (three 7s and three 9s) = ~12% chance to hit on turn\n\n**Pot odds analysis:** Need ~20% equity to call profitably, but I only have ~12% to hit one of my cards. However, implied odds could exist if I hit and can get paid.\n\nBut given:\n1. Opponent is very tight - if they have a T or a set, they may not pay me off big when I hit\n2. Board is very dry - hard to get paid on such a dry board\n3. I have no draw - just two overcards that might not even be good if I hit\n4. I'm in position which is good, but still...\n\nI should fold. The tight opponent betting into me suggests they have something, and even if I'm ahead of their range, it's marginal at best. With my healthy stack, I don't need to take marginal spots like this.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The opponent is very tight but made a small bet. They could be making a small c-bet with air. And I do have position. With pot odds of 4:1 and two overcards, maybe calling isn't terrible.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. A tight player betting on this dry board is likely to have:\n- Top pair (Tx)\n- A set (55, 33)\n- Maybe middle pair\n- Occasionally air making a c-bet\n\nAgainst that range, my 7 and 9 outs might not even be clean. If they have AT, KT, QT, JT, then my 9 outs are no good. Only the 7s would help me.\n\nGiven the opponent's tightness and the fact that many of my outs might be tainted, I think folding is the correct play here. Preserve chips for better spots.\n\nActually, wait. The opponent is in SB and just called preflop. Their range could be wider than I think. They could have suited connectors, small pairs, etc. The small flop bet could be a probe bet.\n\nLet me think about pot odds again. I need to call 2 to win 8. That's 4:1. I have 6 outs (7s and 9s). That's about 12% equity on the turn. I need 20% to break even on immediate odds. But with implied odds...\n\nIf I hit a 7 or 9 and they have a T, I might win a decent pot. But this is a dry board, so it's hard to get paid big.\n\nI think the disciplined play is to fold. I have a big stack, no need to chase marginal hands against a tight opponent who is betting.\n\nNo, actually I'm going to call. Here's why:\n1. The bet is very small (1/3 pot)\n2. I have position\n3. Opponent is tight but could be making a small c-bet with air\n4. I have two overcards\n5. Pot odds aren't great but with implied odds and position, calling is okay\n\nActually, I'm going back to fold. The opponent is too tight, the board is too dry, and my hand is too weak. Let me preserve my chips.",

The pot is currently 3 chips (1 from my small blind + 2 from the big blind).\n\nLooking at the opponent's actions from the recall:\n- They've been very tight, folding most hands (hands 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 18, 19)\n- When they do play, they tend to raise (hands 1, 7, 16, 17)\n- In hand 1 they raised to 18 chips preflop, then folded (presumably to a re-raise)\n- In hands 7, 16, 17 they raised to 6 chips\n\nSo the BB is a tight player who raises with strong hands. This is relevant because:\n1. If I just call, they might raise and I'd have to respond\n2. If I raise, they might fold or 3-bet\n\nWith pocket tens on the button, this is a premium hand.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 9c 5c - This is a weak, non-connected, low suited hand. Very marginal even in position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (Button) - Best position at the table.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 369 chips (92.2 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - Small blind posted 2\n   - Big blind posted 4\n   - Player in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8\n   - I need to call 8 to see the flop\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n   - Very tight player - folds most hands preflop\n   - Has only raised preflop once before (hand #12) to 8 chips\n   - Called 4 chips in hand #13 but folded on the flop\n   - Called 1 chip in hand #19 and bet 2 on flop\n   - Overall pattern: selective, plays few hands, seems to bet small amounts\n\n   So this raise to 8 from a normally tight player suggests they have a real hand.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is 14 before their raise\n   - They raise to 8 (which is a min-raise)\n   - Pot becomes 22\n   - I need to call 8\n   - Pot odds: 22:8 or 2.75:1\n   - Required equity: ~27%\n\n7. **Hand evaluation**: 9c 5c has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a wide range, this hand performs poorly. It's not connected, low cards, only the suited aspect gives it any playability.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. Calling with such a weak hand out of position (though I'm on the button) against a tight player's raise is -EV. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\n**Decision**: This is an easy fold. My hand is too weak, the opponent is tight and showing strength, and I don't have the right pot odds to chase with this speculative hand. Even with position, the hand has very limited potential.",

Strong in early position.\n\n**Position**: UTG (Under The Gun) - This is the worst position at the table since I'll act first on every street. I need to be more cautious.\n\n**Stack Size**: 369 chips (92.2 BB) - I have a very healthy stack, giving me flexibility.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (209 chips) - Short stack\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 (240 chips) - Medium stack\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (40 chips) - Very short stack (10 BB)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B (135 chips) - Short stack\n\n**Action**: I'm first to act after the blinds. I need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\n**Pot**: 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n\nLet me analyze the opponent tendencies from the recall:\n\n1. **DeepSeek-V3.2** (Seat 3): \n   - Hand 20: folded preflop\n   - Hand 21: folded to a raise\n   - Hand 22: called a raise from Kimi-K2, then check-folded to a river bet\n   - Seems tight and passive\n\n2. **MiniMax-M2** (Seat 4):\n   - Hand 20: folded preflop\n   - Hand 21: folded preflop\n   - Hand 22: folded preflop\n   - Very tight, plays few hands\n\n3. **GPT-OSS-120B** (Seat 5):\n   - Hand 20: folded BB\n   - Hand 21: raised to 8, then folded to a re-raise\n   - Hand 22: folded SB\n   - Seems to defend blinds sometimes but folds to pressure\n\n4. **Kimi-K2** (Seat 2):\n   - Hand 20: folded preflop\n   - Hand 21: re-raised to 24 after GPT-OSS raised to 8\n   - Hand 22: raised to 12, then checked flop/turn, bet river\n   - More aggressive, willing to raise and apply pressure\n\n**Analysis**:\n- I have pocket 8s from UTG. This is a decent hand but vulnerable in early position.\n- There are several short stacks at the table (Seats 4 and 5), which might make them more likely to shove with weaker hands.\n- The player in Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown aggression and could re-raise me.\n- From UTG, standard play would be to raise with pocket 8s to:\n  1. Build the pot with a strong hand\n  2. Isolate against fewer opponents\n  3. Take initiative\n\nHowever, I need to consider:\n- If I raise and get re-raised by the aggressive Seat 2, I'll be in a tough spot\n- The short stacks might shove, forcing me to fold or call off my chips\n- From UTG, I should play tighter\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight with pocket 8s and a big stack\n2. **Call (limp)**: Could be okay to see a cheap flop, but gives no information and lets many players in\n3. **Raise**: Standard play, but I need to size it appropriately\n\nGiven I have a big stack and pocket 8s are strong, I should raise. But I need to be prepared to fold to a re-raise from the aggressive Seat 2 or a shove from the short stacks.\n\nStandard raise size from UTG would be 3-4x BB = 12-16 chips.\n\nLet me go with a standard raise of 12 chips (3x BB). This:\n- Builds the pot with my strong hand\n- Gives me initiative\n- Doesn't commit too many chips if I face resistance\n- Is a standard sizing that doesn't give away information\n\nIf I face a re-raise, I can comfortably fold. If called, I'll have position disadvantage but can evaluate on the flop.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- Position: SB (worst position post-flop)\n- Cards: 3s 7c (very weak, offsuit, low cards, no connectivity)\n- Stack: 369 chips (92.2 BB) - deep stacked\n- Pot: 22 chips\n- To call: 6 chips\n\n**Action:**\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) raised to 8 chips\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) called 8 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis from MiniMax-M2:**\n- Very tight player - folded 13 out of 15 recent hands preflop\n- When they do raise, it seems to be with strong hands (based on hand #9 where they were very aggressive)\n- They just raised from early position (Seat 4 is MP)\n- Stack size: 38 chips (very short)\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 3s 7c is one of the worst starting hands in poker. No pair, no suitedness, no connectivity, low cards.\n\n2. **Position**: SB is terrible position - I'll be first to act on every street post-flop\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 6 to win 22 = 3.67:1 odds = ~21.4% equity needed\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: MiniMax-M2 is very tight/weak based on the data. When they raise, they likely have a strong hand. The call from GPT-OSS-120B also suggests some strength.\n\n5. **Implied Odds**: Very low with this hand. Even if I hit a miracle 3-7-7 or 3-3-3 board, it's hard to get paid off significantly.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: I have a healthy stack (92 BB). No need to take risks with garbage hands. Better spots will come.\n\n7. **Post-flop Playability**: This hand will miss the flop ~90% of the time, and when it hits, it's often second-best (e.g., hitting a 7 when someone has a bigger pair).\n \nThis is a clear fold. The hand offers minimal potential and significant risk, especially from a poor position against a tight player. The combination of weak cards, bad position, and opponent strength makes folding the only sensible choice.",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand #26 - PREFLOP**\n- My Position: BTN (Seat 1)\n- My Cards: 8s 5d (offsuit, low cards)\n- My Stack: 369 chips (92.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- Players: \n  - Seat 1: Me (Kimi-K2 Thinking)\n  - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 199 chips\n  - Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 236 chips\n  - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 64 chips (folded)\n  - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 125 chips (folded)\n- Actions: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, seats 4 and 5 folded\n- Amount to call: 4\n- Minimum raise to: 8\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nI've recalled opponent actions for seats 2 and 3.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) - SB:**\n- Hand 21: Preflop raise 24 (big raise)\n- Hand 22: Preflop raise 12, then flop check, turn check, river bet 16\n- Hand 23: Preflop fold\n- Hand 24: Preflop fold\n- Hand 25: Preflop call 4, flop check, flop fold\n\nThis player is somewhat aggressive but also folds frequently. They make big raises sometimes (24, 12) but also fold often. In Hand 25 they just called SB vs BB.\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - BB:**\n- Hand 20: Preflop fold\n- Hand 21: Preflop fold\n- Hand 22: Preflop call 10, then check flop, turn, river, then river fold\n- Hand 23: Preflop fold\n- Hand 24: Preflop fold\n- Hand 25: Preflop fold\n\nThis player is VERY tight. They fold almost always, only calling once when facing a raise. They seem to only play strong hands.\n\n**My Hand: 8s 5d**\nThis is a very weak hand. Offsuit, low cards, no straight potential really, no flush potential. This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN (button), which is the best position. This gives me advantage post-flop.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 4 to win 6 (pot) + 4 (my call) = 10. So 4:10 or 40% equity needed. Even against random hands, 85o has only about 35% equity against two random cards. And that's against random hands - these opponents are tight.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- SB (Seat 2) is somewhat aggressive but folds often. They might raise big.\n- BB (Seat 3) is extremely tight, folds almost always.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I have a healthy stack (92 BB). No need to take risks with weak hands.\n\n**Decision:** \nWith 8s 5d on the button facing a BB who folds almost always and an SB who is aggressive but folds often, I could consider raising to steal the blinds. However, my hand is extremely weak. If I raise and get called, I'll be in tough spots post-flop.\n\nThe pot is only 6 chips. The risk/reward isn't great.

They make big raises sometimes (24, 12) but also fold often. In Hand 25 they just called SB vs BB.\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - BB:**\n- Hand 20: Preflop fold\n- Hand 21: Preflop fold\n- Hand 22: Preflop call 10, then check flop, turn, river, then river fold\n- Hand 23: Preflop fold\n- Hand 24: Preflop fold\n- Hand 25: Preflop fold\n\nThis player is VERY tight. They fold almost always, only calling once when facing a raise. They seem to only play strong hands.\n\n**My Hand: 8s 5d**\nThis is a very weak hand. Offsuit, low cards, no straight potential really, no flush potential. This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN (button), which is the best position. This gives me advantage post-flop.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 4 to win 6 (pot) + 4 (my call) = 10. So 4:10 or 40% equity needed. Even against random hands, 85o has only about 35% equity against two random cards. And that's against random hands - these opponents are tight.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- SB (Seat 2) is somewhat aggressive but folds often. They might raise big.\n- BB (Seat 3) is extremely tight, folds almost always.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I have a healthy stack (92 BB). No need to take risks with weak hands.\n\n**Decision:** \nWith 8s 5d on the button facing a BB who folds almost always and an SB who is aggressive but folds often, I could consider raising to steal the blinds. However, my hand is extremely weak. If I raise and get called, I'll be in tough spots post-flop.\n\nThe pot is only 6 chips. The risk/reward isn't great.

Has shown some postflop aggression when involved.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Very tight preflop - mostly folding, only called once in recent memory.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Very tight but has shown some aggression when playing - raised to 8 in hands 24 and 25. Has a very short stack (60 chips = 15 BB).\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 75 suited is a speculative hand. It's not strong enough to raise UTG, especially with multiple players behind. It has some potential if you hit a straight or flush.\n\n2. **Position**: Being UTG is the worst position - you have to act first on all streets and you don't know what the 4 players behind you will do.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 2 seems reasonably tight\n   - Seat 3 is very tight\n   - Seat 4 is very tight but short-stacked and has shown aggression\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (92 BB). From UTG with a marginal hand like 75s, I should be very selective. The risk of running into a strong hand from one of the 4 players behind me is high.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1), which isn't great for a speculative hand.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold from UTG with 75s. It's too weak to open-raise from early position, and calling would put me in difficult postflop situations out of position with a marginal hand. The opponents behind include some tight players and one short-stacked player who might shove. Best to wait for a better spot.",

I have 5 players left to act behind me, and I'll be out of position postflop against anyone who calls.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 369 chips (92.2 BB) - healthy stack\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB): 58 chips (14.5 BB) - short stack\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (BB): 121 chips (30.25 BB) - medium stack\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2: 240 chips (60 BB) - decent stack\n   - Kimi-K2: 205 chips (51.25 BB) - decent stack\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recent actions I can see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB) has been folding a lot preflop (folded hand 26, just checked hand 27)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (BB) has also been folding preflop\n   - The table seems relatively tight based on limited data\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I'm in a tournament setting where chip preservation is important\n   - Playing speculative hands from early position is generally -EV\n   - The blinds are small relative to stacks, so no pressure to steal\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. This is not enough to justify playing 98o from UTG.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. 98s might be a borderline hand in some situations, but 98o (offsuit) from UTG with 5 players behind is definitely a fold. The hand has poor equity against the ranges that will call/raise behind me, and I'll be out of position postflop. \n\nI should preserve my chips and wait for a better spot, especially from better position.",

When they limped in for 4 chips, they're likely trying to see a cheap flop with a decent hand, or they're desperate.\n\n**Current situation**:\n- Pot is 10 chips (2 from SB, 4 from my BB, 4 from MiniMax's call)\n- It's checked to me (amount to call is 0)\n- I can check or raise to 8 minimum\n\nWith 5s 9d, this is a terrible hand. Even though I'm getting a free flop, I should consider:\n1. The opponent is short-stacked and may be desperate\n2. I'm out of position\n3. My hand has very little equity against any reasonable range\n4. Even if I hit a 5 or 9, I'll often be dominated\n\nThe only argument for checking is that it's free and I have a healthy stack. But playing this hand out of position against a short stack with a weak hand is -EV.\n\nI should fold. There's no point in investing even 0 chips (opportunity cost) when I'm so unlikely to win and I'm out of position. I preserve my stack for better spots.",

I need an 8 to complete the straight (5-6-7-8-9).\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nMiniMax-M2 has only 28 chips left (7 BB), which is very short-stacked. Looking at their recent actions:\n- Hand 28: Called preflop 10, bet 8 on flop, called 8, then checked and folded on turn\n- Hand 25: Bet 4 on flop\n- Hand 27: Checked flop, then folded\n\nThis opponent seems to be playing somewhat aggressively post-flop when they have chips. They called a 10 chip preflop bet in hand 28, which is significant given their stack size.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- It's checked to me on the turn\n- I have an open-ended straight draw (8 outs)\n- MiniMax-M2 is very short-stacked with only 28 chips\n- Pot is 10 chips\n\n**Pot odds calculation:**\nIf I bet, I need to consider what happens if they shove (which they might with any decent hand given their stack size). If I check, I get a free card to see the river.\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have a decent draw (8 outs = ~16% chance to hit on river)\n2. My opponent is extremely short-stacked and may shove over any bet\n3. The pot is small (10 chips)\n4. I'm out of position\n\n\n5. Checking provides a risk-free opportunity to improve my hand\n\nI'll take the conservative approach and check, preserving my chip stack while maintaining the chance to complete my straight draw on the river.",

Our stack: 365 chips (91.2 BB). Blinds: 2/4. Pot: 14 chips. Board: Qc 7d Td 6s 2s. So board is Qc 7d Td 6s 2s. That's a straight possible? Let's see: Qc 7d Td 6s 2s. There are four hearts? Actually suits: Qc (clubs), 7d (diamonds), Td (diamonds), 6s (spades), 2s (spades). So there are two diamonds (7d, Td). No flush possible. Straight possibilities: 7-8-9-T-J? No 8 or 9 on board. Straight with 5? 5-6-7-8-9? No 8. 5-6-7-8-9? No 8. 5-6-7-8-9? No 8. 5-6-7-8-9? No 8. So no straight. Two pair? Board has Q, 7, T, 6, 2. No pairs. So the board is rainbow with no straight possible. Our hand: 5s 9d. We have a 5 and a 9. The board includes a 5? No. 9? No. So we have no pair. Our best hand is high card (Queen). So we have a weak hand.\n\nThe action: Preflop: SB posted 2, BB posted 4. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 4. Others folded. We checked. Flop: We checked, seat 4 checked. Turn: We checked, seat 4 checked. River: We checked, seat 4 bet 4. So they bet 4 into a pot of 14? Actually pot after preflop: Let's compute. Preflop: SB 2, BB 4, Seat 4 call 4. So total preflop: 2+4+4 = 10. Flop: no bets. Turn: no bets. River: we check, they bet 4. So pot is 10 + 0 = 10? Actually after preflop, pot is 10. Then no action on flop and turn. So pot is 10. Then they bet 4, making pot 14 if we call. So amount to call is 4. So we have to call 4 to win 14 (pot includes their bet). So pot odds: 14:4 = 3.5:1. So we need to win at least 22.2% of the time to break even. But our hand is very weak. We have no pair. The opponent could be bluffing or have a weak pair. Let's consider opponent's range.\n\nOpponent: MiniMax-M2, seat 4, stack 24 chips (very short). They have 24 chips left. They bet 4 on the river. They have been passive (checking all previous streets). They could have a weak pair like 2x, 6x, 7x, Tx, Qx. They could have a straight draw? No draws. They could have a pair of 2's, 6's, 7's, T's, Q's. They could have a busted draw? No draws. They could be bluffing with nothing. But they have a short stack and might be trying to get value from a weak hand.\n\nWe have a high card Q. If they have a pair of any card (2,6,7,T,Q), we lose. If they have a pair of Q's, they have top pair. They could have Qx (like Q2, Q6, Q7, QT). They could have a pair of T's, 7's, 6's, 2's. They could have a pair of 2's (like 2x). They could have a pair of 6's (like 6x). They could have a pair of 7's (like 7x). They could have a pair of T's (like Tx). They could have a pair of Q's (like Qx). They could have a straight? No. They could have a flush? No.\n\nWe have no pair. So we beat only a bluff or a hand with no pair (like a lower high card). But they have been passive and then bet on river. Could be a value bet with a pair. Could be a bluff with a missed draw? No draws. Could be a bluff with nothing"

The board is Qc 7d Td 6s 2s. We have no pair, no draw, just high card Q. This is a very weak hand.\n2. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has a short stack of 24 chips. They've been passive (checking all streets) and now bet 4 on the river. This is likely a value bet with some pair or weak hand.\n3. **Pot odds**: We need to call 4 to win 14, giving us 3.5:1 odds. We need ~22% equity to break even.\n4. **Opponent's range**: Given the passive play, they likely have some pair (2x, 6x, 7x, Tx, Qx) or are bluffing. But with no draws on board, bluffing is less likely.\n5. **Our equity**: With just high card Q, we likely have well under 22% equity against any pair. We only beat pure bluffs.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. We have a very weak hand, the opponent's betting pattern suggests they have something, and we don't have the pot odds to call with just high card Q.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"High card Q with no pair against opponent's river bet.

The Ace is strong but the 6 is weak.\n- In position (I'm on the button) this is playable, especially with good pot odds.\n- However, it's still a marginal hand that can get me in trouble if I hit the Ace and face aggression.\n\n**Opponent analysis - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):**\nLet me recall their actions. The tool shows:\n- They tend to fold a lot preflop (folded in hands 20, 21, 22, 23, 26)\n- They've raised to 8 in hands 24, 25\n- They called in hand 28 (called 10), then bet 8 on flop, called 8, then folded on turn\n- They called in hand 29, then checked flop, turn, and bet 4 on river\n\nIn this hand, they just called 4 preflop. This suggests they don't have a premium hand (would likely raise stronger hands). They could have:\n- A pocket pair (low/medium)\n- Suited connectors\n- Broadway cards\n- Some random suited hand\n- Maybe a weak Ace\n\n**Position considerations:**\n- I'm on the button, which is the best position postflop.\n- If I call, I'll see the flop with position on both opponents (MiniMax-M2 and the BB).\n- This is a huge advantage.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- I have 363 chips (healthy stack)\n- MiniMax-M2 has 34 chips (short stack)\n- BB (Kimi-K2) has 201 chips\n\nThe short stack of MiniMax-M2 is important. If I call and they have a strong hand, they could be pot-committed. But with only 34 chips, they're not a huge threat to my stack.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- This appears to be a tournament setting (chip stacks, blinds increasing)\n- With 90+ BB, I have a comfortable stack\n- I can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position\n- However, I should be careful not to bleed chips with marginal holdings\n\n**Decision analysis:**\n\n1. **Fold**: Too tight. I'm getting 5:1 pot odds on a hand that's not great but has some potential, and I have position.\n\n2. **Call**: Reasonable. I close the action, get good pot odds, and have position postflop. If I hit an Ace, I need to be cautious about kicker problems. If I hit a 6, I could have two pair or trips. The main risk is getting dominated by a better Ace.\n\n3. **Raise**: Could be an option. A raise to 8 or 10 would:\n   - Isolate against the short stack\n   - Take initiative in the hand\n   - Possibly win the pot preflop if they fold\n   - But it risks more chips with a marginal hand\n   \nGiven the short stack of MiniMax-M2 (34 chips), if I raise to say 12-16, I could be putting them in a tough spot. But I don't have a strong read that they're weak here - they just called, which could mean anything.\n\n**My recommendation: CALL**\n\nReasoning:\n- Good pot odds (5:1)\n- Excellent position on the button\n- MiniMax-M2's call doesn't indicate great strength\n- I can control the pot size postflop\n- Low risk with potential reward\n-"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: 6h As (pair of sixes with ace kicker)\n- Board: 6s 7s Td (I have a pair of sixes)\n- Position: BTN (button)\n- Stack: 361 chips (90.2 BB)\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- Current action: It's checked to me\n\n**Opponents remaining:**\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (BB) - 201 chips, checked preflop and on flop\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 34 chips, called preflop\n\nLet me analyze the data on MiniMax-M2 from the search results:\n\n1. **Hand 20**: Folded preflop\n2. **Hand 21**: Folded preflop\n3. **Hand 22**: Folded preflop\n4. **Hand 23**: Folded preflop  \n5. **Hand 24**: Raised preflop from UTG to 8, everyone folded\n6. **Hand 25**: Raised preflop to 8, bet 4 on flop and took down pot\n7. **Hand 26**: Folded preflop\n8. **Hand 27**: Checked preflop, checked flop, folded to flop bet\n9. **Hand 28**: Called preflop raise, bet 8 on flop, called raise to 16, then folded on turn\n10. **Hand 29**: Called preflop, checked flop and turn, bet 4 on river and took down pot\n\n**MiniMax-M2 tendencies:**\n- Generally tight, folds most hands preflop\n- When they do play, they can be aggressive (see hands 24, 25, 28)\n- They bet on the river in hand 29 after checking twice\n- Stack is very short (34 chips = 8.5 BB)\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have middle pair (6s) with ace kicker\n- Board is 6s 7s Td - there are potential flush and straight draws\n- The 7 and T could connect with many hands\n\n\n- I need to carefully evaluate my position and potential threats\n\nI recognize the board texture is moderately dangerous with multiple potential draws. My pair of sixes might be vulnerable, but my position on the button gives me strategic advantage. The short stack of MiniMax-M2 and the checked action suggest an opportunity for a value bet, but I must be cautious of potential stronger hands or draws.\n\nThe pot is modest at 12 chips, and I have a significant chip lead with 361 chips. This allows me some flexibility in my betting strategy. I need to balance protecting my hand with not overcommitting to a potentially weaker position.\n\nThe potential straight draw from 8-9 and the spade flush possibility make this board tricky. While I have a pair, it's not a particularly strong one. A small value bet could help me gauge my opponents' hand strength without risking too many chips.\n\nI should consider betting small to extract information and potentially take down the pot if my opponents are weak. The checked action suggests they might not have strong hands, but the board's connectivity means I can't be too aggressive.\n\nMy stack size gives me room to maneuver, so I can afford a modest bet to test the waters. A bet of 4-6 chips would be proportional to the pot and allow me to control the hand's progression without overcommitting.\n\nI'm sensing an opportunity to apply pressure, especially against the short-stacked player. The board texture suggests potential draws, but my position allows me to dictate the action. With both opponents showing passivity, a strategic bet could capitalize on their uncertainty.\n\nThe key is balancing risk and reward - extracting value while protecting against potential draws. A calculated bet might force difficult decisions for my opponents, particularly the player with the shortest stack.\n\nI need to carefully consider the minimum raise threshold and how it impacts my potential betting strategy, ensuring I make a move that maximizes my positional advantage without unnecessarily inflating the pot.\n\nMy pair of sixes with an ace kicker gives me a decent but not dominant hand. I'll make a small, strategic bet to gather information and potentially control the pot's progression. A 4-chip bet represents a precise, calculated approach that allows me to test my opponents' reactions while maintaining flexibility in the hand.\n\nThis conservative betting approach lets me probe the strength of my opponents' hands without committing significant chips, keeping my options open for later streets.",

Let me check...\n\nWait, the data says Seat 4 has 0 chips (out) but they just raised to 34. That doesn't make sense. Let me re-read...\n\nActually, looking at the players list:\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (out)\n\nBut then the action shows:\n- flop: Seat 4 raise 34\n\nThis is contradictory. If they're out, they shouldn't be able to act. Let me assume there's an error in the status and Seat 4 actually has chips.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have middle pair (6s) with Ace kicker on a board of 6s 7s Td\n- Possible straight draws: 89, 89s\n- Possible flush draw: spades\n- I'm facing a raise and a re-raise on the flop\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):**\n- Preflop: Mix of raises and folds, seems to raise with decent hands\n- Flop history: Mostly folds and checks, one bet of 8 in hand 27\n- In this hand: Called preflop, checked, then raised to 16 on flop\n- This is an unusual action for them - they don't typically raise flops\n\n**Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2):**\n- Preflop: Mix of folds, raises (usually 8), and calls\n\n\n- Flop history: Active with various bets, raises, and calls\n- Known for aggressive play with multiple betting patterns\n- In this hand: Called preflop, then raised to 34 on flop\n- Shows significant strength with a substantial raise\n\n**Pot Odds and Decision:**\n- 30 chips to call into a 66-chip pot\n- Getting 2.2:1 pot odds\n- Requires 31% equity to justify calling\n- Likely facing strong hands like top pair, sets, or potential draws\n\n**My Hand Evaluation:**\n- Middle pair with Ace kicker provides some potential\n- Vulnerable to multiple stronger hands\n- Uncertain about opponents' true chip stacks and intentions\n- High risk of being dominated by stronger pairs or draws\n\n**Recommended Action:**\nFold due to unfavorable pot odds, likely opponent strength, and limited hand potential.\n\nMiniMax-M2's substantial 34-chip raise signals serious hand strength, suggesting they have me beat. With two opponents showing aggression, continuing would be throwing good money after bad. The potential flush draw and Ace kicker aren't enough to justify the risk. Folding now protects my 357-chip stack, avoiding a costly mistake against likely superior hands.",

It's not strong enough to raise for value, but on the button with a tight player in BB, it might be playable.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is a huge advantage - I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - BB (DeepSeek-V3.2) is very tight, folding most hands. If I call, they're likely to have a strong hand when they don't fold.\n   - SB (Kimi-K2) is aggressive and plays many hands.\n4. **Pot odds**: Need to call 4 to win 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. Not great for Ace-8.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. Calling with a marginal hand could get me in trouble, especially against a tight BB who will only continue with strong hands.\n\nThe tight BB player is key here. If I call and the BB has a strong hand (which is likely given their tightness), I'll be out of position against them postflop (though I'll act after the aggressive SB). \n\nAce-8 offsuit plays poorly postflop, especially when the BB is tight. I could raise to try to steal the blinds, but:\n- The SB is aggressive and might defend\n- The BB is tight but when they call/raise, they'll have me dominated\n\n\nI'll fold this marginal hand. The tight big blind's range makes Ace-8 offsuit too risky. Despite my button position, the potential to be dominated and the poor pot odds make folding the smartest move. I want to preserve my stack for better opportunities.",

Queen is decent but the 2 is terrible, and they're not suited (wait, they ARE suited - both clubs). So I have Q2 suited. Still a marginal hand at best.\n\n**Position:** BB - I'm out of position postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 353 chips (88.2 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Situation:** \n- Blinds are 2/4\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 8 from Seat 3 (MP position)\n- Everyone else folded\n- I need to call 4 to see the flop\n\n**Opponent info (DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nLooking at the recall data, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in hands 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32 (7 out of 10 hands)\n- Raised in hand 28 and was aggressive postflop (raised flop, bet turn)\n- No showdown data\n\nThis suggests DeepSeek-V3.2 is a tight player who only raises with strong hands. Their raise to 8 (2x BB) is a min-raise.\n\n**Pot odds:** \nPot is 14 chips, I need to call 4. So 14:4 or 3.5:1 odds.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nQ2 suited is a weak hand, but suited. However, even with suitedness, this is a fold in most situations because:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. Against a tight raiser who likely has a strong range\n3. Q2 has very poor equity against typical raising ranges\n4. Even if I hit a flush, I could be dominated by higher clubs\n\nThe pot odds are decent (3.5:1), but my hand equity is likely much worse than that against a tight raiser's range. \n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack and don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving chips is important.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. This is an easy fold despite the suitedness and decent pot odds. The hand is just too weak and I'm out of position against a tight player.",

This means when they raise, they likely have a strong hand.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips into a pot that will be 26 chips (16 + 8 + 2 from SB). That's about 30% pot odds, which would require me to win about 30% of the time. With 9s 6c, I definitely don't have that equity.\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: I have 351 chips (87.8 BB), which is a healthy stack.

          "reasoning_content": "  The search didn't return any results, which suggests this might be early in the tournament or we don't have much history on these opponents yet. Let me think about this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I have 2d 3d (2-3 suited) on the BTN\n- Pot is 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n- I need to call 4 chips to see the flop\n- My stack is 351 chips (87.8 BB)\n- Only SB and BB remain besides me\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n2-3 suited is a very weak hand. Even though it's suited, the cards are too low and too disconnected. \n- In a heads-up or 3-way pot from the button, we might consider playing some speculative hands\n- However, 2-3 suited has very poor equity against typical calling ranges\n- We're only getting 1.5:1 pot odds (need to call 4 to win 6)\n- Even if we hit a flush, we could easily be beaten by higher flushes\n- If we hit a straight (A-2-3-4-5), we have the low end\n\n**Position advantage:**\n- We have position on both remaining players (BTN)\n- This is valuable, but not enough to justify playing such a weak hand\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- We're deep enough (87.8 BB) to make speculative plays, but...\n- This hand has very poor playability post-flop\n- We'd be playing out of position post-flop despite being on the button (since we'd be first to act if we just call and SB checks)\n\n**Opponent considerations:**\n- No history available on these specific players\n- SB has 241 chips (60 BB) - relatively healthy stack\n- BB has 268 chips (67 BB) - also healthy\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is an easy fold. 2-3 suited is simply too weak to play even with position advantage. We should preserve our chips for better spots. The pot odds are not attractive enough, and the hand has very poor equity realization.",

Seat 5 is GPT-OSS-120B. Looking at their preflop raises:\n- Hand 4: raised 12\n- Hand 5: raised 4  \n- Hand 12: raised 8\n- Hand 21: raised 8\n- Hand 34: raised 10\n\nThis is a massive raise to 111 chips! This is highly unusual based on their pattern. They typically raise small amounts (4-12 chips). This huge raise suggests either:\n1. A very strong hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK maybe)\n2. A complete bluff with a weak hand\n3. They're trying to bully with a medium hand\n\n**My hand analysis:**\nQc Kh is a strong hand, especially in BB:\n- It's offsuit but has two high cards\n- Dominated by AA, KK, QQ, AKs, AKo\n- Ahead of most other hands\n- Good tournament hand\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- I have 347 chips (86.8 BB)\n- Calling 107 would leave me with 240 chips\n- If I raise to 212 minimum, I'd have 135 left\n- If I fold, I preserve my stack\n\n**Opponent's massive raise:**\nThe raise to 111 is 27.75 BB! This is enormous. Given their pattern of small raises, this is either:\n1. AA/KK trying to get value\n2. A complete bluff trying to steal\n3. QQ/AK trying to avoid tough decisions\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in BB, so I'll be out of position postflop if I call.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- This is hand #37, we're still relatively early\n- Preserving stack is important but so is accumulating chips\n- Folding QK to a huge raise might be too tight\n- Calling leaves me pot-committed\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Pot odds:** Getting about 1.17:1, which is not great\n2. **Implied odds:** If I hit a Q or K, I could win a big pot\n3. **Reverse implied odds:** If I hit and they have AA/KK, I could lose big\n4. **Opponent's pattern:** They've never raised this big before\n5. **Stack preservation:** Folding keeps me at 86.8 BB\n\n**Analysis of opponent's possible hands:**\n- **Premium hands (AA, KK, QQ, AK):** Would make sense for this raise size\n- **Bluffs:** Possible but risky for them\n- **Medium pairs (JJ, TT, 99):** Might raise big to avoid tough decisions\n- **AQ, AJ:** Might raise big but less likely\n\n**My options:**\n1. **Fold:** Safe, preserves stack, but might be too tight against an unknown\n2. **Call:** 107 chips to see flop, leaves me with 240, pot would be 232\n3. **Raise:** Minimum 212, which would commit me\n\n**Recommendation:**\nGiven the opponent's unusual massive raise from their pattern, and the fact that I'm out of position with QK offsuit, I think this is a fold. The raise size is too suspicious and commits too many chips preflop with a hand that could be dominated.\n\nHowever, QK is a strong hand and folding might be too tight. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, thinking more carefully:\n- The pot is already 125 chips\n- I need to call 107\n- If I call, pot will be 232 and I'll have 240 left\n- I'll be essentially pot-committed\n\nIf I call and hit a Q or K on the flop, I could win a big pot. If I miss, I can check-fold.\n\nBut the opponent's massive raise is very concerning. They've never done this before in 36+ hands.\n\n**Final decision:** I think this is a marginal spot but given the opponent's unprecedented raise size and my position, I"

Showdown hand was Tc 7d, which is a very weak hand.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- Q3 offsuit is a weak hand, even from the button\n- Only 2 cards to call to see the flop\n- I have position post-flop\n- My stack is healthy at 86 BB\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak, Q-high with weak kicker\n2. **Position**: Good (on the button)\n3. **Pot odds**: Getting 3:1 (call 2 to win 6), which is decent\n4. **Opponent tendency**: BB has been active but also folds to pressure\n5. **Stack preservation**: 86 BB is healthy, losing 2 chips won't hurt\n6. **Implied odds**: Low - even if I hit a Q, I'll likely be outkicked\n\nFrom the button with a weak hand, I have two reasonable options:\n- Fold: Safe, preserve chips, wait for better spot\n- Call: Cheap, in position, can steal post-flop if BB shows weakness\n\nGiven that:\n- It's only 2 chips (0.5 BB) to call\n- I'm in position\n- The BB has shown willingness to fold post-flop\n- My stack is healthy\n\nI think calling is reasonable to see a flop in position. However, Q3o is really weak. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, with Q3 offsuit, even hitting a Q is dangerous (I'll be outkicked by any other Q). The only good flops would be:\n- Two pair (very unlikely)\n- Trip 3s (unlikely)\n- Straight draws (very unlikely)\n\nMost of the time I'll miss completely or hit a weak pair. Given this, folding is probably better despite the good position and cheap price. I should wait for a better hand.\n\nLet me fold this one.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**1. Hand strength and potential:**\n- I have 8s 9d - this is a suited connector (though not suited with each other) in a rainbow format\n- It's a mediocre hand that can make straights and two pairs, but no flush potential\n- In late position (BTN), this hand plays better\n\n**2. Position and stack size:**\n- I'm on the BTN (best position) with 345 chips (86.2 BB) - healthy stack\n- Seat 2 (SB) has 245 chips and has been fairly active\n- Seat 3 (BB) has 268 chips and seems more selective\n\n**3. Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- **Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**: Has raised preflop 3 times in the last 10 hands (hands 31, 35, 36). Shows aggression but also folds frequently. In hand 35, they raised preflop but folded on the flop. They seem to be playing a fairly wide range.\n- **Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**: More selective - only raised preflop twice (hands 33, 37) and folded to a re-raise in hand 37. They seem tighter and more positionally aware.\n\n**4. Current situation:**\n- It's folded to me on the BTN\n- I need to call 4 chips to see the flop\n- The blinds are 2/4, so I'm getting 6:4 pot odds (1.5:1)\n- With 86 BB, I have room to play speculative hands in position\n\n**5. Decision:**\nWith 8s9d on the button, facing only the blinds, this is a clear raise situation. I want to:\n- Steal the blinds (both opponents seem capable of folding)\n- Build the pot when I have position\n- Take initiative in the hand\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies, both can fold to pressure. Seat 2 has shown willingness to fold postflop, and Seat 3 is more selective preflop. A standard raise of 3x the BB (12 chips) seems appropriate here to put pressure on the blinds and potentially take down the pot preflop.",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand #39 - PREFLOP**\n\n- My Position: BTN (Seat 1)\n- My Cards: 8s 9d (suited connector, but not suited - offsuit)\n- My Stack: 333 chips (83.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 54 chips\n\n**Players:**\n- Seat 1: Me (Kimi-K2 Thinking) - 333 chips\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 245 chips (folded)\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 232 chips\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (folded)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 127 chips (folded)\n\n**Actions this hand:**\n1. preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 2\n2. preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 4\n3. preflop: Seat 5 fold\n4. preflop: Seat 1 raise 12 (MY RAISE)\n5. preflop: Seat 2 fold\n6. preflop: Seat 3 raise 40 (RE-RAISE)\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Amount to call: 28 (I need to put in 28 more chips)\n- Minimum raise to: 68\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponent analysis (DeepSeek-V3.2 in Seat 3):**\nFrom the recall data, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been:\n- Folding a LOT preflop (hands 23, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 36, 38)\n- Occasionally raising (hand 28 raised to 12, then continued aggression on flop and turn)\n- Hand 33: raised to 8\n- Hand 35: called 8, then bet 8 on flop\n- Hand 37: raised to 10, then folded\n\nThis is a tight player who folds most of the time but occasionally raises. When they do raise, they sometimes follow up with aggression.\n\n**My hand: 8s 9d**\n- Offsuit suited connector\n- Decent speculative hand, especially on the button\n- Can flop straights, two pairs, etc.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 54 chips\n- I need to call 28 chips\n- Pot odds: 54:28 or about 1.93:1\n- This is roughly 34% equity needed\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- I have 333 chips (83 BB)\n- Opponent has 232 chips (58 BB)\n- We're both deep enough to play postflop\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is great. I'll act last postflop.\n2. **Hand strength**: 89o is a decent speculative hand, especially in position.\n3. **Opponent tendency**: This player is tight. Their re-raise from the BB after I raised from the BTN suggests strength.\n4. **Pot odds**: 28 to win 54 is decent but not amazing.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: We're deep enough that losing 28 chips won't hurt much, but winning this pot could be significant.\n\n**What does opponent's raise mean?**\n- From a tight player, a 3-bet from the BB against a BTN raise usually means:\n  - Strong premium hands: AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe JJ, TT, AQ\n  - Sometimes a bluff, but this player folds too much to bluff often\n- The raise size is 40, which is 10x the BB. That's substantial.\n\n**If I call:**\n- I'll see flop with 89o\n- Pot will be 82 chips (54 + 28)\n- I'll have position\n- But I'm likely behind opponent's range\n\n**If I fold:**\n- I lose 12 chips already invested\n- That's fine - it's a small loss\n\n**If I raise:**\n- Minimum raise is 68, which would be a 4-bet\n- This would be committing with 89o, which is too weak\n- I'd only do this as a pure bluff, and against a tight player, that's not advisable\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAgainst a tight player who 3-bets from the BB, my 89o is likely dominated. The pot odds aren't compelling enough to call with this speculative hand against a strong range. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nThe fact that this opponent folds so much preflop but is now 3-betting suggests they have a real hand. I don't want to invest 28 more chips with 89o.\n\nLet me make the fold decision."

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand situation:\n- I'm on the Button with 8d 3h (very weak hand)\n- I have 333 chips (41.6 BB)\n- Blinds are 4/8, so I posted 4 as SB\n- Pot is 12 chips\n- Amount to call: 4 (completing my SB)\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nThis is a very weak hand (8-3 offsuit). From the Button position, I could theoretically call the small additional amount, but this hand has virtually no playability postflop. \n\nLet me analyze the opponent tendencies from the recall data:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 in BB) seems to be the most active player\n  - Hand 36: bet 18 on flop\n  - Hand 37: folded preflop\n  - Hand 39: folded preflop  \n  - Hand 40: raised to 12 preflop, then bet 20 on flop\n  - Hand 41: folded preflop\n  - Seems like a reasonably aggressive player\n  \n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): \n  - Hand 37: raised to 10 preflop then folded\n  - Hand 39: raised to 40 preflop\n  - Hand 40: folded to a raise\n  - Seems to make occasional preflop raises\n  \n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B):\n  - Hand 37: made a big all-in raise (111 chips)\n  - Hand 40: called 8 preflop, then folded to flop bet\n  - Seems capable of making big moves\n\nGiven my very weak hand (8-3 offsuit), even though I'm getting decent odds to call 4 chips into a 12 chip pot (3:1 odds), this hand will be very difficult to play postflop. \n\nThe key considerations:\n1. Hand strength: 8-3 offsuit is in the bottom 10% of starting hands\n\n\n2. Position advantage is minimal with such a weak hand\n3. No realistic chance of improving meaningfully\n4. Better to preserve stack for stronger opportunities\n\nI'll fold this hand. The potential 3:1 pot odds don't compensate for the extremely low probability of winning. Saving 4 chips now allows me to wait for a more favorable situation where I can make a more strategic play. The risk of getting trapped in a difficult postflop scenario far outweighs the small potential gain from calling with such a marginal hand.",

Amount to call is 8 (the big blind)\n\nOpponent observations from the last 20 actions:\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, BB this hand): Has been fairly active. They made a big raise of 111 chips in hand 37, called 8 in hand 40, but has folded several times too. They seem to defend their BB sometimes but also fold frequently.\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB this hand): Has folded many times preflop, but did raise to 40 in hand 39. Generally seems tight.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has folded most hands, raised to 12 in hand 40.\n\nMy hand A9o from UTG is a marginal hand. It's not strong enough to raise from early position in a full ring game. With an Ace I'm somewhat dominated by better aces (AK, AQ, AJ, AT). \n\nFrom UTG, I should have a very tight range. A9o is typically a fold from this position. \n\nIf I call, I'd be investing 8 chips (1 BB) with a hand that will often be dominated and is out of position against everyone else.\n\nThe pot odds are 12:8 or 1.5:1, which isn't great for a marginal hand.\n\nGiven:\n- My position (UTG is worst position)\n- Hand strength (A9o is weak, easily dominated)\n- Stack size (healthy, no need to take marginal spots)\n- Tournament considerations (preserve chips for better spots)\n\nI should fold this hand.",

Raising could also be considered as a semi-bluff, but given the opponent's tight nature and the King on board (they could easily have a King), calling is safer. I want to see the turn and potentially get more value if I hit.\n\nLet me call 8 chips.",

This suggests weakness.\n\n**Pot odds**: \n- Pot is 48\n- If I bet, I need to consider what size\n- With a flush draw and gutshot, I have about 12 outs out of 46 unknown cards = ~26% chance to hit on river\n- Need better than 3:1 pot odds to call, but since I'm betting, I need to think about fold equity\n\n**Opponent's stack**: They have 79 chips left, and the pot is 48. They bet 8 on flop, leaving them with 79 chips.\n\n**Decision**: I should bet here. My opponent showed weakness by checking the turn. I have a strong draw (flush + gutshot). I can either:\n1. Check and take a free card\n2. Bet to apply pressure and potentially take down the pot now\n\nGiven that my opponent is tight and tends to fold when facing aggression, and they've shown weakness by checking, I think betting is better than checking. A good size would be around 1/2 to 2/3 pot.\n\nLet me bet about 24-32 chips (1/2 to 2/3 pot). This applies pressure and gives me fold equity.\n\nI'll go with 30 chips as a solid semi-bluff.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: 7c 5h - This is a pretty weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. Not a good starting hand.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Best position, but with a weak hand like this, position isn't enough to justify playing.\n\n**Stack**: 353 chips (44.1 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Pot**: 12 chips (SB + BB)\n\n**Action**: I posted SB (4 chips), Seat 2 posted BB (8 chips), everyone else folded. Now it's my turn to act.\n\n**Amount to call**: 4 more chips (to match the BB of 8 total)\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: Looking at Seat 2's history:\n- They tend to fold preflop often (folded in hands 37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45)\n- When they do raise preflop (hands 36, 40), they follow up with bets on the flop\n- They seem relatively tight/passive based on this small sample\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. My hand is very weak (7-5 offsuit)\n2. I only need to call 4 more chips into a pot of 12 (getting 3:1 odds)\n3. However, even with these odds, 7-5 offsuit is rarely going to be ahead\n4. I'm in position (on the button), which is good, but this hand doesn't have good playability\n5. I could consider raising as a steal attempt since opponent folds a lot, but:\n   - Minimum raise is to 16 (12 more chips)\n   - This is 1.5 BB, which is significant\n   - While opponent folds a lot, I don't have enough data to be confident about a steal\n   - If called, I'll be out of position postflop with a terrible hand\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold with 7-5 offsuit. The hand has poor equity, and while the call is cheap, it's not worth investing even 4 chips with this hand. Save chips for better spots.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the pot odds. I need to call 4 to win 12, which is 3:1. But even with these odds, 7-5 offsuit is just too weak. \n\nActually, let me think about the button position more carefully. On the button with only the BB left to act, I could theoretically raise as a steal. But:\n- The raise would need to be to 16 (12 more chips)\n- That's 1.5 BB risk\n- Opponent does fold a lot (6 out of 8 preflop actions were folds)\n- But 2 out of 8 were raises, showing they can be aggressive with good hands\n\nGiven my hand is so weak (7-5 offsuit), even as a steal attempt this is marginal. If I'm going to steal on the button, I should do it with hands that at least have some equity when called (like suited connectors, Ax, broadways, etc.).\n\n7-5 offsuit has terrible equity when called. If I raise to 16 and get called, I'm putting in 12 chips with a hand that will miss the flop most of the time and I'll have to give up.\n\nThe fold is the clear, correct play here. It's not worth risking chips with such a weak hand, even with good position and some fold equity.",

It's not a premium hand, but being suited gives it some potential. From the button position, this is a decent hand to play, especially against the blinds.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the opponent actions I recalled:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has folded preflop multiple times (hands 41, 43, 44, 45, 46). Seems tight.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Has folded preflop frequently but did call once in hand 44. Also folded hands 41, 42, 43, 45, 46. Seems tight as well.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has folded a lot but did raise to 16 in hand 45 and bet on flop. Seems capable of aggression but mostly folds.\n\n**Position & Stack:**\n- I'm on the button, which is the best position post-flop\n- I have a healthy stack of 44.1 BB\n- Both blinds seem tight based on their folding patterns\n\n**Decision:**\nWith J7s on the button against two tight opponents in the blinds, this is a clear call. The hand has decent playability post-flop, and I have position. I could consider a raise, but with 44 BB, I don't need to be too aggressive with marginal hands. \n\nThe pot is 12, I need to call 8, so I'm getting 1.5:1 immediate pot odds. With implied odds and position, this is profitable.\n\nI should NOT raise here because:\n1. J7s is not strong enough to raise for value\n2. If I raise and get re-raised, I'd have to fold\n3. I want to see a cheap flop in position with a speculative hand\n\n\n4. The blinds' tight tendencies suggest I can capitalize on their cautious play without risking unnecessary chips\n\nA strategic call allows me to exploit their tightness while minimizing potential losses with a marginal hand. The combination of position, moderate stack, and opponent tendencies makes calling the optimal choice.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent in seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has been playing quite tight - lots of folds and only occasional aggression. They raised to 40 chips in hand 39, and in hand 44 they called preflop then bet 8 on the flop.\n\nNow they're checking the flop to me. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**My hand:** Jh 7h - I have a gutshot straight draw (need 9 to make J-T-9-8-7) and a backdoor flush draw. This is a weak draw.\n\n**Board:** Qd Th 8c - There's a possible straight with J-9, but I don't have that. The board is somewhat coordinated with straight possibilities.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the button, which is good position.\n\n**Stack sizes:** \n- Me: 345 chips (43.1 BB)\n- Opponent: 288 chips\n\n**Pot:** 20 chips\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** DeepSeek-V3.2 appears to be playing tight. They check-folded preflop many times, and when they did play (hand 44), they bet the flop. Now they're checking to me, which could mean:\n1. They missed the flop\n2. They have a marginal hand and want to see a free card\n3. They're trapping with a strong hand\n\nGiven their tight nature, checking likely indicates weakness more often than strength.\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check - see a free card with my weak draw\n2. Bet - try to take down the pot now with a semi-bluff\n\nWith my gutshot and backdoor flush draw, I have some equity but not a lot. However, given that my opponent is tight and has shown weakness by checking, a small bet could take down the pot immediately. If called, I still have some outs.\n\nThe pot is 20 chips. A bet of around 1/2 pot (10-12 chips) would be reasonable for a semi-bluff. The minimum raise is 8 chips, which is less than 1/2 pot but still a credible bet.\n\nI think a small semi-bluff is appropriate here given:\n- My opponent's tight/checking tendency suggests weakness\n- I have some equity with my gutshot\n- I'm in position\n- The pot is small enough that I can apply pressure without risking too much\n\nI'll bet 12 chips (slightly more than half pot) to put pressure on my opponent.",

The larger than usual raise (24 vs 12) suggests genuine strength\n2. However, I'm on the button with a decent hand\n3. The opponent folds to pressure often post-flop\n4. I have position advantage\n5. The call is cheap relative to my stack\n\nWith KJs on the button, I have good implied odds. The opponent's tendency to fold post-flop combined with my position makes this a profitable call. I could also consider a 3-bet to take control, but given their larger raise size, calling seems safer and more profitable given their post-flop tendencies.",

Also, someone could have a straight with Qx (Queen with any card), or even a straight flush with Qd.\n\n**Pot:** 52 chips\n**My Stack:** 341 chips\n**Opponent (Seat 2):** 227 chips\n\nThe action preflop:\n- Seat 2 raised to 24 (3x BB)\n- I called from the big blind\n\nLooking at the opponent's history:\n- Kimi-K2 has been relatively active with preflop raises (hands 31, 35, 36, 40)\n- They tend to bet on the flop when they raise preflop (hands 36, 40)\n- They sometimes fold on the flop after checking (hand 35)\n- In hand 48, they just called preflop and then folded\n\nGiven the preflop raise to 24, this suggests they have a decent hand. The board is extremely coordinated with 3 diamonds. Even though I have two pair, I'm very vulnerable to:\n1. Any diamond (flush)\n2. Qt (straight)\n3. AQ or QJ (straight)\n4. AA, KK, JJ (sets)\n\nWith the board being so wet and connected, and facing no bet on the flop (I can check), I should be cautious. This is a classic spot where checking is the right play because:\n1. I don't want to build a big pot with a vulnerable two pair\n2. If my opponent has a flush or straight, I want to keep the pot small\n3. If they have a weaker hand, they might bluff or value bet thinner\n4. I need to see the turn card to get more information\n\nChecking here is the standard play. I don't want to bet and get raised, as I'd be in a very tough spot. Let my opponent define their hand strength first.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My Hand:** Js Kh (Jack of spades, King of hearts)\n**Board:** Jd Kd Ad (Jack, King, Ace of diamonds)\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - good position\n**My Stack:** 341 chips (42.6 BB)\n**Opponent:** Kimi-K2 in Seat 2 with 187 chips\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Pot is 92 chips\n- I checked on the flop\n- Opponent bet 40 chips\n- I need to call 40 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have top two pair (Jacks and Kings), but the board is very scary:\n- There are 3 diamonds on board (Jd Kd Ad) - flush draw is complete\n- There are straight possibilities with Q-T making a straight\n- I have the King of hearts, so I don't have a diamond in my hand\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nLooking at the opponent actions, Kimi-K2 has been:\n- Raising preflop frequently (hands 31, 35, 36, 40)\n- Making continuation bets on the flop (hands 36, 40)\n- Folding to pressure sometimes (hand 35 folded after checking flop)\n\nThis opponent seems aggressive preflop and on flop, but can fold when facing resistance.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 92 chips\n- Bet: 40 chips\n- To call: 40 chips\n- Pot odds: 132:40 or 3.3:1\n- Equity needed: ~23%\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- I have top two pair, which is strong but vulnerable\n- Any diamond makes a flush\n- Q-T makes a straight\n- Any Ace gives someone trips\n- If opponent has AQ or any Ace, they have me beat (they have trips)\n\n**Decision:**\nWith top two pair on a very wet board (flush already there, straight possibilities), I'm in a tough spot. The opponent bet less than half pot (40 into 92), which could be:\n1. A value bet with a made flush or trips\n2. A semi-bluff with a strong draw\n3. A continuation bet with a weaker hand\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive tendencies and the fact that they raised preflop, they could have:\n- An Ace (trips)\n- Two diamonds (made flush)\n- A strong draw\n- A pair like QQ or TT\n\nSince I don't have any diamond in my hand and the flush is already there, I'm very vulnerable. However, I do have top two pair which is strong. \n\nThe pot odds are decent (3.3:1), but I'm not sure I'm ahead here. If I call, I'll have to face another bet on the turn or river.\n\nGiven my stack size (42.6 BB), I have room to play, but this is a tournament and preservation matters.\n\nI think the best play here is to **fold**. The board is too coordinated, I have no redraws to a flush, and many hands beat me. The opponent's aggression suggests they likely have something strong here.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I have top two pair on a board where I could be drawing dead to a flush. But the opponent only bet 40 into 92, which is less than half pot. This could be a value bet sizing with trips or a made flush, or it could be a smaller bet with a draw.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's pattern, they bet 18 into an unknown pot on hand 36, and 20 on hand 40. This 40 chip bet into 92 is proportionally larger than their previous bets.\n\nGiven that I have no diamond and the flush is already there, and there are straight possibilities, I think this is a fold. The risk is too high given tournament considerations.",

Let me look at their tendencies:\n   - They fold a lot preflop (hands 41, 43, 44, 45, 47)\n   - They called once (hand 48) but then folded on the flop\n   - They raised once (hand 49) and then bet on the flop\n   - They seem to be playing tight overall\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 12 chips, getting 3:1 odds.\n\n6. **Position advantage**: Being on the button means I can see how the flop plays out and act last.\n\nWith 8h Ts on the button facing a tight opponent who folds a lot, I have a few options:\n\n- **Fold**: This is safe but too tight. I have position and decent odds.\n- **Call**: This is reasonable. I'm getting 3:1 odds, have position, and the opponent is tight. If I hit a T or 8, I could have the best hand.\n- **Raise**: This would be a steal attempt. Given the opponent folds a lot preflop (5 out of 7 times shown), a raise could work. However, with my weak hand, I'd prefer to see a cheap flop.\n\nGiven my position, the opponent's tendency to fold, and the pot odds, I think calling is the best option. I want to see a cheap flop in position with a hand that has some potential (any T or 8 gives me top/middle pair).\n\nIf I hit something decent on the flop, I can take advantage of my position. If I miss, I can easily fold to any aggression.\n\nThe minimum raise to 16 is too much to risk with this marginal hand. Folding is too tight given the position and opponent tendencies.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n**My hand**: 8h Ts (8 of hearts, 10 of spades)\n**Board**: Jd Qh 4h (Jack of diamonds, Queen of hearts, 4 of hearts)\n**Position**: BTN (button)\n**Stack**: 333 chips (41.6 BB)\n**Pot**: 16 chips\n\n**Current situation**: \n- I called the small blind (4 chips) preflop\n- BB checked\n- Now on the flop, it's checked to me and I can check or raise\n\n**Hand analysis**:\n- I have an open-ended straight draw (need a 9 to make a straight 8-9-T-J-Q)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (two hearts would give me a flush)\n- I have no pair, no made hand currently\n\n**Opponent analysis**:\nLooking at the opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 41, 43, 44, 45, 47)\n- In hand 48 they called preflop then folded\n- In hand 49 they raised preflop and bet 40 on the flop\n- In hand 40 they bet 20 on the flop\n\nThis suggests they're capable of betting but also fold frequently. Their range when checking to me could be weak or they could be trapping.\n\n**Pot odds**: Pot is 16, if I bet minimum (8), I'm getting 2:1 immediate odds if they fold. But I need to think about implied odds.\n\n**Position**: I have position which is good. I can check behind and see a free card, or I can bet as a semi-bluff.\n\n**Stack sizes**: I have 333 chips, opponent has 271 chips. Both are deep enough to play post-flop.\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. I have a decent draw (open-ended straight draw = 8 outs = ~32% chance to hit by river, ~16% by turn)\n2. I have position\n3. Pot is small (16 chips)\n4. Opponent tends to fold a lot but can bet when they have something\n5. Checking gives me a free card to potentially hit my straight\n6. Betting could win the pot now or build it for when I hit\n\n\n7. The board texture is relatively dry with potential straight and flush possibilities\n\nI'll carefully evaluate the semi-bluff opportunity. The board's characteristics suggest a strategic bet could be effective. With an open-ended straight draw and backdoor flush potential, a calculated semi-bluff might pressure my opponent while maintaining flexibility for future streets.\n\nThe semi-bluff offers multiple strategic advantages. By betting around 12-16 chips, I can potentially win the pot immediately, control the hand's trajectory, and set up favorable scenarios for my draw. The opponent's check provides an opening to apply pressure and potentially take down the pot without a showdown.",

They seem somewhat tight but can be aggressive.\n   - Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - Very tight! They folded in hands 45,46,48,49,50. Only played hand 44 (called preflop and bet flop) and hand 47 (checked and folded).\n\n6. **Action**: I need to call 8 to see flop.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: 12:8 or 1.5:1. Need 40% equity to break even.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: With 43.6 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I can afford to wait for better hands.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Q3s is a marginal hand at best\n- While I'm on the Button with good position, this hand doesn't play well post-flop\n- The BB (DeepSeek) is very tight, so stealing might work, but the SB (Kimi) is more active\n- With Q3s, I'm likely dominated if I hit a Queen, and flush draws will be weak (3-high flush)\n- The pot odds aren't great for this hand quality\n- I should preserve my stack for better opportunities\n\nDecision: FOLD. This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, even with position, and I have a healthy stack that doesn't require taking marginal spots.",

With 42 BB, I should preserve my chips for better opportunities rather than risk getting into difficult post-flop situations with a low, unconnected hand.\"\n}\n```",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** 4h 5d - This is a suited connector (4-5 offsuit). It's a speculative hand that can make straights and flushes.\n\n**Position:** Button - This is the best position post-flop as I'll act last.\n\n**Stack:** 337 chips (42.1 BB) - Healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n**Pot:** 12 chips (1.5 BB)\n\n**To call:** 8 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - 279 chips. From the recall, they fold quite a bit preflop (hands 47, 52, 53, 54), but they also raise sometimes (hands 49, 51). They seem to be a mixed player - not super tight, not super loose.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - 244 chips. This player is VERY tight preflop - they folded 7 out of 9 hands shown, with only one raise in hand 53. They seem to only play premium hands.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 4-5 offsuit is a speculative hand. It has potential to make straights (2-3-4-5-6, 3-4-5-6-7, 4-5-6-7-8) but no flush potential since it's offsuit. It's not a strong starting hand.\n\n2. **Position:** Being on the Button is excellent. I'll have position post-flop which gives me control.\n\n3. **Opponents:** The BB is very tight, so if I hit something strong, I might get paid. The SB is more active.\n\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 8 to win 12, so 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not great for a speculative hand like 4-5 offsuit.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With 42 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands. I should be selective.\n\n6. **Stack preservation:** Calling with a marginal hand out of position (well, I'm in position, but with a weak hand) could lead to difficult spots post-flop.\n\n**Decision:** With 4-5 offsuit, I'm getting 1.5:1 pot odds which isn't enough to justify playing this speculative hand. \n\nI'm on the button, but I need to consider the opponent tendencies. Seat 2 has shown some aggressive behavior with raises in hands 49 and 51, and they have a decent stack of 279 chips (34.9 BB). Seat 3 is extremely tight, folding 7 out of 9 hands.\n\nThe pot is currently 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8). I need to call 8 chips, which is 2.4% of my stack. While this seems small, playing 4-5 offsuit can lead to tricky post-flop situations.\n\nThe key issue is that 4-5 offsuit has limited potential. It can't make a flush, and straight possibilities are limited. Even if I hit a pair, it's likely to be a low pair with significant kicker problems.\n\nWith my position on the button, I might be tempted to call and see a flop, but the hand's limitations and the risk of getting into a difficult post-flop spot make folding the more prudent choice. I'll preserve my chips for a better opportunity.\n\nI'm folding this marginal hand to wait for a stronger position or more favorable cards.",

However, they called this time rather than raising, which might indicate a medium-strength hand.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- There's 20 chips in the pot\n- I can check for free (amount to call is 0)\n- Minimum raise would be to 16\n\n**Decision:**\nWith T5 offsuit on the button, this is a clear fold. Even though I have position and could see a free flop by checking, this hand has very little equity and will be difficult to play postflop. The opponent has shown they can be aggressive postflop, and I don't want to get involved with such a weak holding.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

The board shows 9d Jh As, so I don't have any pair, straight draw, or flush draw. I only have a gutshot straight draw (would need a Queen to make a straight, but with Th on board, that's not even a strong straight).\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is good position, but my hand is very weak.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the opponent data for Seat 2:\n   - They tend to fold preflop a lot (many folds in hands 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 52, 53)\n   - When they do enter pots, they often raise (hands 40, 49, 51, 56)\n   - They've shown aggression postflop with bets (hands 40, 49, 55)\n   - They called preflop in this hand, which suggests some strength\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 41.1 BB, I have a decent stack. I should preserve chips when I have weak hands.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is small (20 chips), and I have no hand and no real draw. Even if I check and see a free card, I'd need a Queen to make a straight, but that would be a weak straight on a board with an Ace. Even if I hit a Ten, I'd have second pair which is not strong on this board.\n\n**Decision**: I have a very weak hand with no draw on a board that likely hits my opponent's calling range hard (Ace, Jack, and 9 are all cards that connect with many hands). Checking here to see a free card is fine, but I have almost no equity. I should not put any money into this pot.\n\nThe best action is to **check** and see what happens. If my opponent bets, I'll likely need to fold unless it's a very small bet (but even then, my hand is very weak).",

Let me look at their history:\n\nFrom the opponent actions I can see:\n- Hand 40: Preflop raise 12, flop bet 20\n- Hand 48: Preflop call 8, then fold\n- Hand 49: Preflop raise 24, flop bet 40\n- Hand 50: Preflop check, flop fold\n- Hand 51: Preflop raise 24\n- Hand 55: Preflop call 4, flop bet 16\n- Hand 56: Prefloat raise 24, then fold\n\nThis opponent seems to be fairly active preflop with raises, and bets flops when they raise preflop. They folded hand 56 after raising preflop, suggesting they can give up.\n\nIn this hand:\n- Preflop: They called 8 (just limped in)\n- Flop: They checked\n- Now on turn: It's my action\n\nThe fact they just called preflop and checked flop suggests weakness. They could have:\n- A weak ace that they're scared of the K on turn\n- A draw that missed\n- Middle pair\n- Complete air\n\nMy hand is very weak - just a gutshot. However, I have position and the opponent has shown weakness by checking twice. This is a good spot for a bluff.\n\nBut let me think about stack sizes:\n- I have 329 chips\n- Pot is 20\n- Opponent has 259 chips\n\nIf I bet, what size? Minimum raise is 8 (which would be 8 more, making it 28 total? No, wait - \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount. Minimum raise to 8 means I can bet 8 chips total.\n\nActually, looking at the prompt: \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this means the minimum total bet is 8 chips. Since the current bet is 0 (I can check), raising to 8 means betting 8 chips.\n\nA half-pot bet would be ~10 chips. A pot-sized bet would be 20 chips.\n\nGiven I have a gutshot and the opponent has shown weakness, I could:\n1. Check and take a free card\n2. Bet as a bluff\n\nChecking is safe but gives up on winning the pot now. With a gutshot, I have some equity.\n\nBetting could win me the pot now if opponent folds. Given they've checked twice, they likely have a weak hand.\n\nHowever, my hand is very weak. Only 4 outs. The opponent could have:\n- Any ace (they called preflop)\n- Any king (now they have top pair)\n- Two pair\n- A set\n\nThe K on turn is a scare card that could help my bluff, as it completes potential straights and could scare someone with an Ace.\n\nGiven the opponent's pattern of being aggressive when they have something (they bet flops when they raise preflop), and here they just called preflop and checked flop, they're likely weak.\n\nThis is a good spot for a small bluff bet. I'll bet about half pot - around 10-12 chips.\n\nWait, but the minimum raise is 8. I can bet anywhere from 8 up to my stack.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations:\n- I have 41 BB, which is a healthy stack\n- I don't need to take big risks\n- But picking up small pots is good\n- A small bluff here is low risk\n\nI think a small bet of around 10-12 chips is appropriate.

I don't need to risk chips in this spot\n5. If I hit my straight on river, I can value bet then\n\nHowever, I could also consider a small bluff bet since opponent is weak. But given my hand is so weak, checking is safer.\n\nLet me reconsider: The opponent checked twice, which is very weak. A small bet could win this pot.

That's a small bet.\n\nBut my hand is SO weak. I have no pair, no flush draw, just a gutshot.\n\nI think the conservative and correct play is to **CHECK**.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the opponent's patterns.

Let me analyze the situation carefully.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Hand #57, TURN\n- My position: BTN (Seat 1)\n- My cards: Th 5c\n- My stack: 329 chips (41.1 BB)\n- Board: 9d Jh As Kc\n- Pot: 20 chips\n- Actions this hand:\n  - Preflop: Seat 5 posted SB 4, I posted BB 8, Seat 2 called 8, others folded, I checked\n  - Flop: I checked, Seat 2 checked\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Minimum raise to: 8\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have Th 5c\n- Board is 9d Jh As Kc\n- I have NO pair\n- I have NO flush draw (only one heart in my hand)\n- I have a gutshot straight draw: If a Q comes, I'd have T-J-Q-K-A straight\n- Outs: 4 Queens (Q\u2660, Q\u2665, Q\u2666, Q\u2663)\n- Probability of hitting straight on river: ~8% (4 outs / 46 unknown cards)\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n- Opponent is Seat 2\n- They called preflop (didn't raise)\n- They checked flop\n- They checked turn (action is on me)\n- This shows significant weakness\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Current pot: 20 chips\n- If I check: I see river for free\n- If I bet: I need to decide on amount\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak, only gutshot draw\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (best position)\n3. **Opponent's actions**: They've shown weakness by checking twice\n4. **Board texture**: Kc on turn is a scare card that could scare someone with an Ace\n5. **Tournament context**: I have a healthy stack (41.1 BB), don't need to take big risks\n\n**Decision options:**\n\n**Option 1: Check**\n- Pros: See river for free, no risk\n- Cons: Give up chance to win pot now, opponent might hit something on river\n\n**Option 2: Bet (bluff)**\n- Pros: Can win pot immediately, exploit opponent's weakness\n- Cons: Risk chips with weak hand\n\n**Given the situation:**\n- Opponent has shown significant weakness (call preflop, check flop, check turn)\n- I have position\n- The Kc on turn is a good scare card\n- Checking is free and I might hit my gutshot\n\n**Recommended action: CHECK**\n\nReasoning:\n1. I have a very weak hand with only 4 outs (8% chance)\n2. I can see the river for free\n3. My opponent might be trapping, but their actions suggest weakness\n4. I don't need to risk chips in this spot\n5. If I hit my straight on river, I can value bet then\n\nHowever, I could also consider a small bluff bet since opponent is weak. But given my hand is so weak, checking is safer.\n\nLet me reconsider: The opponent checked twice, which is very weak. A small bet could win this pot. But is it worth the risk?\n\nGiven I have a gutshot, I have SOME equity. A small bet of around 8-12 chips could work. But if I get called, I'm in trouble.\n\nI think the best play is to **CHECK** and take the free card. The risk of betting outweighs the reward given my hand strength.\n\nWait, let me think about this differently. In poker, when you have a weak hand but your opponent shows more weakness, you can often win with a small bet. This is called a \"position bet\" or \"information bet\".\n\nGiven:\n- Opponent called preflop (could have Ax, Kx, Qx, Jx, small pairs)\n- Checked flop (missed or weak)\n- Checked turn (still weak)\n\nA small bet of 8-12 chips could win this pot often enough to be profitable. But I need to consider that if I get called, I have to give up on river (unless I hit my straight).\n\nGiven the minimum raise is 8, I could bet 8 chips total (which is 8 into a pot of 20, so 40% pot). That's a small bet.\n\nBut my hand is SO weak. I have no pair, no flush draw, just a gutshot.\n\nI think the conservative and correct play is to **CHECK**.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the opponent's patterns. From the recall, I can see:\n\n**Seat 2's patterns:**\n- Hand 40: Preflop raise 12, flop bet 20 (aggressive when strong)\n",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**My hand**: Th 5c (Ten of hearts, Five of clubs)\n**Board**: 9d Jh As Kc 6c (9\u2666 J\u2665 A\u2660 K\u2663 6\u2663)\n\n**Final hand evaluation**: My best 5-card hand is just Ten-high. The board shows no pair, no flush, no straight that I can make. I have absolutely nothing.\n\n**Opponent**: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been the only other active player. Let me analyze their tendencies from the data:\n\nFrom the recall data:\n- They've been very active preflop with a mix of raises and folds\n- They bet on flops when they show aggression (hands 40, 49, 55)\n- In hand 40: raised preflop 12, bet flop 20\n- In hand 49: raised preflop 24, bet flop 40  \n- In hand 55: called preflop 4, bet flop 16\n- They sometimes check-fold (hand 50: check preflop, fold flop)\n\n**Current situation**:\n- The betting has been completely passive: check-check on every street (flop, turn, and now river)\n- Pot is only 20 chips (just the blinds)\n- I have nothing (Ten-high)\n- Opponent could also have nothing, or they could be trapping with a strong hand\n\n**Key observations**:\n1. The board is very coordinated: 9-J-A-K-6 with 4 different suits (no flush possible). This is a scary board with multiple high cards.\n2. Both players have shown zero aggression, suggesting both likely have weak hands\n3. My hand is absolutely worthless - I can't even beat a pair of 2s\n4. Opponent has shown they CAN be aggressive when they have something (based on past hands where they bet flops after raising preflop)\n5. The pot is tiny (20 chips), and I have 329 chips\n\n**Decision**: I should check here. There's no value in betting because:\n- Any hand that calls me beats me (even a pair of 2s)\n- I have no bluffing equity - what better hand would fold? The opponent has shown no weakness in their actions that would suggest they'd fold to a bluff\n- The pot is too small to risk chips on a pure bluff\n- Checking costs me nothing and might win if opponent also has nothing\n\nI cannot win by betting - only lose more chips. Checking gives me a chance to win the small pot if opponent has nothing, or lose nothing more if they have something.",

Let me think about this...\n\nActually, looking at the actions:\n- Seat 1 (me) posted SB 4\n- Seat 2 posted BB 8\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 5 folded\n\nSo it appears the button is on Seat 1, but I posted the SB.

Let me re-examine...\n\nWait, the problem says \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\" but then \"preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 4\". This suggests that either:\n1. The positions are mislabeled, or\n2. It's a situation where the BTN also posts the SB (which happens in heads-up)\n\nBut we have Seat 2 (BB) with 271 chips, and they're still in the hand. So it's not heads-up yet. Let me think about the table configuration again...\n\nActually, maybe the \"BTN\" label is just telling me I'm on the button, but due to the posting sequence, I ended up posting the SB. This could be a tournament setting where the button is on Seat 1, but the blinds are posted by Seats 1 and 2. Let me assume I'm actually in the SB position, but the \"BTN\" label is just informing me about where the button is.\n\n**My Hand: Jc Js** - Pocket Jacks.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the opponent's behavior:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been relatively passive\n- They fold often preflop (hands 52, 53, 56)\n- When they do play, they can call (hand 55, 57) and occasionally raise (hand 56)\n- In hand 55, they called preflop then bet 16 on the flop\n- In hand 57, they called preflop and then checked down to showdown with pocket 4s\n\nFrom the showdowns:\n- Hand 57: They had 4d 4s (pocket 4s) and called preflop, suggesting they'll call with small pocket pairs\n- Hand 30: They had Tc 7d (T7 offsuit) - this seems like they were in the BB and checked\n\nSo the opponent seems to be a relatively straightforward player who:\n- Folds weak hands preflop\n- Calls with medium strength hands like small pocket pairs\n- Can occasionally raise but also folds to pressure\n- Plays somewhat passively postflop\n\n**My Analysis:**\n\nWith pocket Jacks (Jc Js) in this spot:\n- I'm facing only the BB (everyone else folded)\n- I have a premium hand that dominates most of the opponent's range\n- The opponent has shown they'll call with hands like pocket 4s\n- My stack is healthy at 40.6 BB\n- The opponent's stack is 33.9 BB\n\n**Decision:** I should raise to build the pot and extract value from my premium hand. A standard raise would be 3x the BB (24 chips), but since I'm in the SB and it's 4 more to call, a raise to 24-32 chips would be appropriate.\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to call with medium hands and my position (assuming I'm SB/out of position), I should make a solid raise. Let me raise to 24 chips (3x BB) which is standard.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise: it's 16 chips. A 3x BB raise would be to 24 chips total. This seems appropriate.\n\nLet me reconsider the position confusion. The problem states \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\" but then shows \"preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 4\". This is contradictory. However, the key information is:\n- I posted 4 chips (SB)\n\n\n- Seat 2 posted 8 chips (BB)\n- I need to call 4 more chips\n\nI'll carefully evaluate my position and potential actions. The conflicting position information requires a precise approach to maximize my advantage with pocket Jacks.\n\nCalculating the raise mechanics reveals nuanced possibilities. A 3x big blind raise to 24 chips represents a strategic move that balances aggression with pot control. This sizing pressures opponents while maintaining flexibility for future streets.\n\nThe hand's dynamics suggest a calculated raise that extracts value and potentially isolates weaker holdings. My pocket Jacks warrant a confident, well-sized preflop action.",

Ace is good, but kicker is terrible. Suited helps slightly.\n2. **Position**: Excellent. Acting last postflop is a huge advantage.\n3. **Opponents**: Both can be aggressive but also fold to pressure. DeepSeek has made big raises recently.\n4. **Stack sizes**: All stacks are deep enough (40+ BB) that we can play postflop poker.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: We're in decent chip position. Don't need to take unnecessary risks, but button is a good spot to accumulate.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight for button with A3s. We're giving up too much equity.\n- **Call**: \n  - Pros: See flop in position, good pot odds, can control pot size\n  - Cons: Could face aggression from either player, dominated by better aces\n- **Raise**:\n  - Pros: Take initiative, possibly win pot preflop, define hand strength, play in position\n  - Cons: Could get 3-bet by either player, especially DeepSeek who has been aggressive\n\nGiven I'm on the button with A3s, I think a raise is appropriate to try to take control. However, I need to be careful about sizing. If I raise and get 3-bet, I'll likely have to fold given the weak kicker.\n\nA standard button raise would be about 2.5-3x the BB, so around 20-24 chips. This would be 2.5-3x the BB.\n\nLet me consider the minimum raise is 16, which is only 2x BB. That's a bit small and might invite calls/raises. A raise to 24 (3x BB) seems more appropriate.\n\nActually, looking at the stacks, a raise to 20-24 seems good. Let me go with 24 to make it a proper 3x BB raise, which is standard from the button.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. With A3s, I don't want to bloat the pot too much preflop because my hand is easily dominated. The advantage of position means I can call and see a flop, then make decisions based on board texture.\n\nGiven the weak kicker, maybe calling is better. I have good pot odds (8 to win 12), I'm in position, and I can control the pot size postflop. If I hit an ace, I need to be cautious about kicker issues. If I hit a flush draw, I have good implied odds.\n\nI think calling is the most prudent play here. It keeps the pot small, allows me to use my positional advantage postflop, and doesn't risk getting 3-bet off my hand.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. The button is a stealing spot. With A3s, I have some equity if called. A raise to 24 (3x BB) gives both opponents a decision. If they fold, I win 12 chips uncontested. If they call, I'm in position. If they 3-bet, I can fold knowing I'm likely dominated.\n\nGiven that both opponents have shown they can fold, and I'm on the button, I think"

          "reasoning_content": "  This is a tricky situation. Let me analyze:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 3s Ah (ace with a weak kicker)\n- Board: Ts Td Qs \n- Position: Button\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- To call: 24 chips\n- My stack: 329 chips (41.1 BB)\n\n**Board texture:**\n- Paired board with Ts Td Qs\n- Two spades (potential flush draw)\n- I have the 3s which blocks some flush draws but not strongly\n\n**My hand:**\n- I have Ah - so I have an overcard to the board\n- Backdoor nut flush draw (need two more spades)\n- However, my kicker is terrible (3s)\n- On a paired board like this, my ace-high is not very strong\n\n**Opponent tendencies (Seat 3 - DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nI should check what I know about this opponent. Let me look at their actions.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 48, need to call 24\n- Getting 2:1 on my call\n- Need ~33% equity to call\n\n**Situation:**\n- Preflop: I called from button, SB called, BB checked\n- Flop: SB checks, BB bets 24 into 48 pot (half pot)\n- This could be: value bet with T or Q, semi-bluff with flush draw, or pure bluff\n\nGiven that I have position and an ace-high with backdoor flush draw, calling might be okay, but I'm not thrilled about it. Let me think about what hands beat me:\n- Any T (trip tens)\n- Any Q (top pair)\n- Any pocket pair 22-JJ (though some might not bet)\n- Flush draws\n\nWhat do I beat?\n- Pure bluffs\n- Some weaker hands like KJ, K9, etc.\n\nThe bet sizing of half pot suggests either a value bet or a standard c-bet. Given the paired board, I think folding is probably best here. My ace-high is just not strong enough on this board texture, and I don't have great implied odds.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. In position with an ace-high and backdoor flush draw, calling 24 to win 72 (48+24) might be okay. But I'm still not happy about it. The fact that the board is paired makes it more likely they have trips or a full house possibility.\n\nI think folding is the correct play here. My hand is too weak to continue, and I can find better spots with my 41 BB stack.\n\nWait, let me think about tournament considerations. With 41 BB, I have a decent stack and don't need to take marginal spots. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities. The call would put me in difficult turn/river spots without a clear plan.\n\nFinal decision: FOLD.",

I have to act first preflop and will be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n**Stack Size**: I have 329 chips (41.1 BB). This is a medium stack. I need to be careful not to jeopardize my tournament life with marginal hands.\n\n**Opponents**: \n- Seat 2: 263 chips (short-medium stack)\n- Seat 3: 340 chips (posted SB, medium stack)\n- Seat 5: 47 chips (very short stack, posted BB)\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 12, so 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not relevant with such a weak hand.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With Q4o from UTG, this is an easy fold. I don't need to take risks with such a weak hand, especially when I have a healthy stack. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold decision based on basic poker fundamentals.

While I have a suited hand, it's not strong enough to call a raise from the SB out of position. The opponent has shown aggression, and Js 9s doesn't play well against a typical raising range. The 55 chip call represents a significant portion of my stack (18%), and I'll be out of position postflop. This is a clear fold to preserve my tournament life.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand:** Ah 2h (Ace of hearts, 2 of hearts) - This is a suited A2 hand. It has some potential but is not a strong hand. It can make the nut flush, but if an Ace comes on the board, my kicker is terrible (2). \n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. This is a big advantage.\n\n**Stack size:** I have 305 chips (19.1 BB). This is a decent stack size, though not deep.\n\n**Blinds:** 8/16, so the pot is 24 (SB + BB)\n\n**Action:** \n- Seat 2 (SB) posted 8\n- Seat 3 (BB) posted 16\n- I need to call 16 to see the flop\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 in SB):**\n- Has shown some aggression preflop (raised to 24 in hand 60)\n- Has called preflop (hands 59, 62)\n- Has folded preflop (hands 58, 61)\n- Showdowns show they play some weaker hands (T7o, 44, K5o)\n- Seems to be a somewhat loose player\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB):**\n- Has been quite aggressive preflop (raised to 60 in hand 56)\n- Has folded preflop many times (hands 57, 58, 60, 61, 62)\n- Has check-called in hand 59\n- Seems to be a tighter player who occasionally makes big raises\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** A2s is a marginal hand. It has flush potential but terrible kicker problems if an Ace hits. It's a hand that plays well in position against weak opponents, but can get you in trouble.\n\n2. **Position:** Being on the Button is excellent. I get to act last on every street post-flop.\n\n3. **Stack size:** With 19.1 BB, I have enough chips to see a flop, but I shouldn't be committing too many chips with a marginal hand.\n\n4. **Opponents:** \n   - The BB (DeepSeek-V3.2) seems tighter and has shown aggression. They might defend their blind.\n   - The SB seems looser and could have a wide range.\n\n5. **Pot odds:** I need to call 16 to win 24, which is 1.5:1 odds. This is not great for a marginal hand like A2s.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** With 19.1 BB, I should be somewhat selective. A2s is at the bottom of my playable range, but position helps.\n\n**Decision:** I think calling is reasonable here given my position and the fact that both opponents seem beatable. The BB has shown they can fold to pressure, and being on the Button gives me maximum information post-flop. However, I need to be careful post-flop and ready to fold if I don't hit a strong hand.\n\nRaising could also be an option to try to steal the blinds, but with A2s I prefer to see a cheap flop rather than build a big pot with a marginal hand.\n\nI'll call and see the flop in position.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 19.1 BB and A2s, this is a borderline hand. The BB has shown aggression (raised to 60 in hand 56), so they might defend. Given my position and the fact that I only need to call 16 (5.2% of my stack), I think calling is fine to see a flop and try to hit a flush or get a good situation to steal.\n\nBut wait - let me think about this more carefully. With A2s, I'm really hoping to hit a flush. If I hit an Ace, I have kicker problems. If I hit a 2, it's usually not good enough. So I'm basically set-mining for a flush. \n\nWith the BB showing aggression and the SB being loose, I might be better off folding this marginal hand and waiting for a better spot. However, the power of position on the Button is significant.\n\nI think I'll go with a call. The price is reasonable (16 chips to see a flop from the best position), and I can easily fold if I miss or if the action gets too heavy post-flop.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **Current situation**: It's the flop, action is on me (BTN). Both opponents checked to me. Pot is 48 chips. I have Ah 2h.\n\n2. **Board**: Ad 8c 7c\n   - I have top pair with a weak kicker (Ace with 2 kicker)\n   - There are two clubs on board, so a flush draw is possible\n   - The board is somewhat coordinated with 8-7, so straight draws are possible\n\n3. **Hand strength**: I have top pair, but with a terrible kicker. This is a marginal hand at best.\n\n4. **Opponent actions**: Both opponents checked. This could mean:\n   - They have nothing and are giving up\n   - They have marginal hands and want to see a free card\n   - They're trapping with a strong hand\n\n5. **My position**: I'm on the Button, which is good position. I acted last preflop and am acting last now.\n\n6. **Stack sizes**: I have 289 chips (18.1 BB), which is a decent stack. Not desperate yet.\n\n7. **Pot size**: 48 chips, which is 3 BB. It's a small pot.\n\n8. **My options**: I can check or raise (minimum raise to 16).\n\nLet me think about what to do:\n- If I check, I give a free card. With two clubs and connected cards, there are many turn cards that could hurt me (any club, any 9, any 6, any other Ace with a better kicker, etc.).\n- If I bet, I need to decide on a size. The minimum raise is 16 (which would be a bet of 16 since I'm facing 0 to call). That would be a small bet into a 48 pot (1/3 pot).\n\nWith top pair, even with a weak kicker, I should probably bet for value and protection. I want to:\n1. Get value from worse hands (like 8x, 7x, straight draws, flush draws)\n2. Charge draws to continue\n3. Find out where I stand\n\nA bet of 16 (1/3 pot) seems reasonable. It's not too big, but it charges draws and might get calls from worse hands.\n\nHowever, let me think about checking. If I check, I'm giving free cards. But with my weak kicker, maybe I want to control the pot size. But I think betting is better because:\n- I have top pair\n- The board is draw-heavy\n- I can get value from many worse hands\n- Both players showed weakness by checking\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. I have Ah 2h. The board is Ad 8c 7c.\n- I have top pair, weak kicker\n- There are many hands that could be ahead: A8, A7, 88, 77, AK, AQ, AJ, AT\n- There are many draws: any two clubs, 9-6, 9-T, T-6\n\nBut the key is: both opponents checked. They could have:\n- Nothing (missed the flop)\n- Draws (checking to see a free card)\n- Marginal hands (like my hand)\n\nWith position, I can check behind and see a free card. If the turn is safe, I can bet then. If the turn is dangerous, I can check behind or fold to action.\n\nBut I think betting is better. Let me bet about half pot. The pot is 48, so half pot would be 24. But the minimum raise is 16. Let me bet 24.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions, it says \"Minimum raise to: 16\". This means the minimum total amount I can put in is 16. So I can bet anywhere from 16 up to my stack.\n\nI think a bet of 24 (half pot) is good. It charges draws and gets value from worse hands.\n\nWait, but I should also consider my kicker. With A2, I'm vulnerable to any other Ace. If someone has Ax, I'm losing. But would they check Ax? Maybe with a weak kicker, but probably not. They'd likely bet for value/protection.\n\nGiven both checked, I think betting is correct. Let me bet 24.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. The board is Ad 8c 7c. This is a somewhat coordinated board. I have top pair, weak kicker. Both opponents checked.\n\nIn position with top pair, I should bet for value and protection. My hand is vulnerable but likely best right now. I want to charge draws and get value from worse pairs.\n\nI'll bet 24 (half pot).",

Only saw them bet once on flop after checking preflop. They complete SB here rather than raising.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 4d Ac is a weak Ace with terrible kicker\n- Offsuit, no connectivity\n- From BTN, I could raise to steal, but...\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n1. **Opponent is tight/passive** - They complete SB rather than raise, showing weakness\n2. **My hand is weak** - A4o is marginal, bad kicker\n3. **Position** - I have BTN advantage postflop\n4. **Stack sizes** - Both ~20 BB, healthy\n5. **Tournament** - Need to accumulate chips but avoid marginal spots\n\n**Decision Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight from BTN vs weak opponent\n- **Check**: See flop for free, but with weak hand\n- **Raise**: Steal attempt vs weak opponent\n\n**Optimal Play:** Check. Here's why:\n- My hand is too weak to raise for value\n- Opponent is tight but might defend SB\n- Raising to 32 would risk 2 BB with weak hand\n- I can see flop and evaluate based on opponent's postflop tendencies (they bet flop once, folded another time)\n- Checking keeps pot small with marginal hand\n\n**Postflop Plan:** If I hit Ace, proceed cautiously. If I hit 4, likely still behind. If opponent bets aggressively postflop, fold.\n\n**Final Decision:** Check",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: 4d Ac (Ace-high with a backdoor flush draw)\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Stack: 321 chips (20.1 BB)\n- Board: 9c 5c 6d\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- Opponent: DeepSeek-V3.2 in SB position\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at DeepSeek-V3.2's recent actions:\n- Very tight preflop: folds most hands, occasionally checks or raises\n- When they do play, they tend to be aggressive postflop (see hands 56 and 59 where they bet on flop)\n- They check-folded on flop in hand 63\n- They seem to play straightforwardly - aggressive when they have something, check/fold when they don't\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Preflop: SB called 8, I checked BB\n- Flop: SB checked to me\n- I have Ace-high with no pair, but I have a backdoor nut flush draw (need two more clubs)\n- The board is 9c 5c 6d - somewhat coordinated with straight and flush draws possible\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Weak - just Ace-high, but Ace of clubs gives me backdoor nut flush potential\n2. **Position**: Good - I'm on the button, acting last\n3. **Opponent tendency**: They checked, which likely means weakness. When they have strong hands, they tend to bet (see hands 56 and 59)\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 32, I can check for free\n5. **Tournament situation**: I have a healthy stack (20 BB), no need to take unnecessary risks\n\nGiven that opponent checked and shows a pattern of betting when strong, checking here seems appropriate. I could consider a small bluff bet since I have position and the Ace of clubs gives me some equity, but with Ace-high on a somewhat coordinated board, it's risky. The opponent might call with any pair or draw.\n\nSince checking is free and I have some backdoor equity, I should check and see the turn card.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Current hand:**\n- My cards: 4d Ac (Ace-high, no pair)\n- Board: 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- Position: BTN\n- Stack: 321 chips (20.1 BB)\n- Action: River, DeepSeek-V3.2 checked to me\n\n**Board analysis:**\nThe board shows: 9c 5c 6d 3c Jh\n- There are 3 clubs on board (9c, 5c, 3c) - possible flush\n- Straight possibilities: 3-4-5-6-7, 4-5-6-7-8, 5-6-7-8-9\n- I have 4d (diamond) and Ac (club), so I have the nut flush blocker (Ac) but don't have a flush myself\n- I have Ace-high with no pair\n\n**Opponent analysis (DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nFrom the recall data, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been:\n- Folding preflop frequently (hands 57, 58, 60, 61, 62)\n- Checking then betting on flop in hand 59\n- Checking then folding on flop in hand 63\n- Very passive overall - hasn't shown aggression postflop\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- I have Ace-high, no pair\n- The board is somewhat coordinated with flush and straight possibilities\n- I have the Ac which blocks the nut flush\n- However, I have no showdown value against most hands\n\n**Position and situation:**\n- I'm on the Button (position advantage)\n- It's checked to me on the river\n- Pot is 32 chips (2 BB)\n- I have a healthy stack of 20.1 BB\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak - Ace-high with no pair on a coordinated board\n2. **Opponent tendency**: Very passive, has shown check-fold patterns\n3. **Position**: Good position on the button\n4. **Pot size**: Small pot (2 BB)\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 20.1 BB, I don't need to risk chips in marginal spots\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: Showdown with Ace-high, likely lose but risk nothing more\n- **Bet**: Bluff, trying to get opponent to fold better hands\n\n**Bluffing considerations:**\n- I have the Ac, which blocks the nut flush\n- The board is scary with possible flushes and straights\n- Opponent has been passive and check-folded before\n- However, opponent called preflop from SB and checked through, suggesting some hand strength or draw\n\n**Pot odds**: Not relevant since checking is free\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a classic spot for a thin value bet or bluff, but with Ace-high and no pair, I don't have enough equity to bet for value. While I could consider a bluff given my blocker and opponent's passivity, the risk isn't worth it in a tournament setting with a healthy stack. Checking and taking the free showdown is the safest play.\n\nLet me reconsider - actually, this might be a good bluffing spot. The opponent has shown passivity, I have position, and I have the Ac blocker. A small bet might fold out some weak pairs or missed draws. However, given that we've checked through the entire hand, opponent might have some showdown value they're willing to call with. \n\nGiven my tournament stack is healthy at 20+ BB, I should be more conservative. Checking is the better play here to avoid unnecessary risk.",

Looking at their history:\n- They fold preflop quite often (hands 53,54,57,58,60,61,62)\n- They sometimes check preflop (55,59,63,64)\n- When they do raise preflop (hand 56), they made it 60 and then bet aggressively on flop\n- Overall seems like a somewhat tight/passive player\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 6c 5h is terrible. Not suited, not connected, low cards. This is a fold in almost any situation.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, the worst position. I'll be first to act postflop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 21.6 BB, which is a decent stack. I don't need to take risks with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 40 to win 72, which is about 1.8:1. That's not great odds for a hand this weak.\n\n5. **Opponent tendency**: DeepSeek seems to raise with decent hands. Their preflop raise to 48 suggests strength.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. There's no need to gamble with 65o from the worst position. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, my position is bad, and I have no need to take this risk.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent data:\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**:\n- Recent pattern: Has been folding a lot (hands 61, 64, 65 preflop)\n- Hand 60: Made a small raise (24 chips)\n- Hand 62: Called 47 chips\n- Showdowns: Played T7, 44, and K5 - seems to play speculative hands\n- Overall: Seems somewhat tight/passive recently\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**:\n- Recent pattern: Mostly folding (hands 61, 62 preflop)\n- Hand 63: Checked BB, folded on flop\n- Hand 64: Called 8 chips (defended BB), showed down 2sTs at showdown\n- Hand 65: Made a raise of 48 chips\n- Overall: Also seems tight but capable of raising\n\n**My Situation**:\n- Position: BTN (best position)\n- Hand: Jc Qh (offsuit broadway cards)\n- Stack: 345 chips (21.6 BB) - healthy stack\n- To call: 16 chips\n- Pot: 24 chips\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: QJo is a decent hand on the button, especially against potentially weak opponents. It has good straight potential and is playable in position.\n\n2. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents have been folding a lot recently. Seat 3 just raised in hand 65, but otherwise has been tight. Seat 2 has been folding frequently.\n\n3. **Position advantage**: Being on the button is huge - I'll act last postflop.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1), which is reasonable for QJo on the button.\n\n5. **Stack preservation**: With 21.6 BB, I can afford to see a flop here. \n\nI'm in a prime position to make a strategic move. A standard raise of 3x the big blind offers excellent risk-reward potential. At 48 chips, the raise represents a minimal 14% of my stack while potentially scooping up the blinds. My button position provides maximum flexibility, and the opponents' recent tight play suggests they're likely to fold. The 3x sizing feels just right - not too aggressive, but enough to apply meaningful pressure and potentially take down the pot preflop.",

          "content": "  I need to analyze this situation carefully. Let me break down the key information:\n\n**My Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - Seat 1\n- Cards: 6s 8s (suited connectors, 6 and 8 of spades)\n- Stack: 369 chips (23.1 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (SB) - 298 chips\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB) - 292 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) - SB:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 60: Preflop raise to 24 (1.5x BB)\n- Hand 61: Preflop fold\n- Hand 62: Preflop call 47 (facing a raise)\n- Hand 63: Preflop call 8 (just completed SB), then flop check and fold\n- Hands 64-67: Preflop folds (4 consecutive folds)\n- Hand 68: No data shown but likely fold\n\nShowdowns:\n- Hand 30: Showdown with Tc 7d (weak hand)\n- Hand 57: Showdown with 4d 4s (pocket pair)\n- Hand 62: Showdown with 5s Kc (King high)\n\n**Pattern:** Seems to be playing relatively tight. Raises occasionally but folds frequently. Has shown down with weak hands like T7o and K5o. Not particularly aggressive.\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - BB:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 63: Flop check and fold (after defending BB)\n- Hand 64: Preflop call 8, then check-check-check through river (very passive)\n- Hand 65: Preflop raise to 48 (3x BB - significant aggression)\n- Hands 66-68: Preflop folds (3 consecutive folds)\n\nShowdown:\n- Hand 64: Showdown with 2s Ts (weak hand)\n\n**Pattern:** Generally passive, but occasionally makes large preflop raises (like Hand 65: 48 chips). Defends BB sometimes but plays passively postflop. Has folded to pressure.\n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n1. **My Hand:** 6s 8s is a suited connector. This hand plays well in position, can make straights and flushes, and benefits from seeing flops cheaply. On the button, this is a good spot to see a flop.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the button - the best position. I will act last on every street postflop.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes:** \n   - I have 23.1 BB (369 chips)\n   - SB has 18.6 BB (298 chips)\n   - BB has 18.25 BB (292 chips)\n   - We're all in similar stack territory - not super deep but not desperate yet.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** \n   - Pot is 24, I need to call 16\n   - Getting 1.5:1 immediate pot odds\n   - But implied odds are more important with a suited connector\n\n5. **Opponent Tendencies:**\n   - Both opponents have been folding frequently (4+ consecutive folds for SB, 3+ for BB)\n   - BB occasionally makes large preflop raises (up to 48 chips)\n   - Both play passively postflop\n   - Neither seems particularly strong or aggressive overall\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:**\n   - Blinds are 8/16, so they're meaningful but not critical\n   - My stack is healthy at 23 BB\n   - Losing 16 chips wouldn't hurt much\n   - Winning chips would help build stack\n\n**Decision Options:**\n\n1. **Fold:** Too tight. 6s 8s on the button is a perfectly playable hand, especially against opponents who have been folding a lot.\n\n2. **Call:** The standard play. I get to see a flop in position with a hand that can make strong disguised hands (straights, flushes). The cost is reasonable (16 chips).\n\n3. **Raise:** \n   - Minimum raise to 32 (2x BB)\n   - Could potentially take down the pot immediately\n   - But risks more chips with a marginal hand\n   - SB and BB have shown they can fold to raises\n\n**My Recommendation:**\n\nI think **calling** is the best play here. Here's why:\n\n- **Hand Strength:** 6s 8s is not strong enough to raise for value, but it's too good to fold on the button\n- **Position:** Being on the button is crucial - I'll see how both opponents act before I make any postflop decisions\n- **Pot Control:** Calling keeps the pot"

I should call and see a flop in position.\n\nI could also consider raising, but with 6s8s I'd rather just call and see a flop. A re-raise would be too aggressive with this hand.\n\nDecision: Call 32",

          "content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 6s 8s (6-8 suited spades)\n**Board**: 6c 6d Qs\n**Position**: BTN (Button)\n**Stack**: 321 chips (20.1 BB)\n**Pot**: 192 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis**:\nI have trip sixes (6-6-6) with a Queen on board. This is a very strong hand - I have trips with an 8 kicker. The only hands that beat me are:\n- Pocket Queens (full house)\n- 6-X (where X > 8, giving me a lower kicker)\n- A higher pocket pair that makes a full house\n\n**Action Analysis**:\n- Preflop: Opponent raised from SB to 48, I called with 6s 8s\n- Flop: Opponent bets 80 into a pot of 112 (preflop: 16+48+48 = 112)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2)**:\nLooking at the recall data:\n- This opponent is relatively passive post-flop (lots of checking and folding)\n- They've shown down with weak hands like 4-4, 5-K, T-7\n- They raised preflop in hand 56, 60 (small raises)\n- They've folded to pressure multiple times\n- In hand 62, they called preflop and ended up with K-5 on a Q-4-2-6-Q board (two pair on river)\n\nThe current bet of 80 seems strong - it's about 72% of the pot. Given the board texture (paired board with a Queen), this could be:\n- A Queen (top pair)\n- A pocket pair (trying to protect against draws)\n- A 6 (trip sixes with better kicker)\n- Air (bluff)\n\n**Pot Odds**:\nI need to call 80 to win 192, which gives me 2.4:1 pot odds. I need about 29.4% equity to call.\n\n**Stack Considerations**:\n- I have 321 chips left (20.1 BB)\n- If I call, pot becomes 272 and I have 241 left\n- If I raise to 160 (minimum), I'm committing about half my stack\n\n**My Position**:\nI'm on the button, which is favorable. I have position post-flop.\n\n**Decision**:\nI have trips, which is a very strong hand. Given that my opponent has shown tendencies to be passive and fold to pressure, and given that I have a strong hand with position, I should raise here to:\n1. Get value from weaker hands (Queens, pocket pairs)\n2. Protect against draws (though there aren't many on this board)\n3. Put pressure on the opponent\n\nHowever, I need to consider that if they have a Queen, they might call. If they have a 6 with a better kicker, I'm in trouble. But given their passive nature, they might be betting a Queen or weaker hand.\n\nLooking at their showdown history, they play relatively weak hands. The 80 bet could be a protection bet with a Queen or medium pocket pair.\n\nI think raising is the best play. I can raise to 160 (minimum) or go all-in. Given my stack size and the pot size, a raise to 160 seems reasonable - it applies pressure but doesn't commit my entire stack yet.\n\nLet me reconsider - the pot is 192, they're betting 80. If I raise to 160, I'm giving them 2:1 odds to call. They might call with a Queen. If I go all-in for 321, I'm giving them about 1.6:1 odds.\n\nActually, with trips on a relatively dry board, I should be looking to get value. The opponent's bet of 80 suggests they have something. I should raise for value. Given my stack size and the pot size, I can raise to 200-240 to really put pressure on.\n\nBut wait - the minimum raise is 160. Let me think about the sizing:\n- Call 80: Pot becomes 272, I have 241 left\n- Raise to 160: Total investment 160, pot becomes 352 if they call, I have 161 left\n\nActually, if I raise to 160, that's only adding 80 more to their 80 bet, which is essentially a min-raise. That might not achieve much.\n\nGiven I have trips and position, and given the opponent's passive tendencies, I should raise bigger to:\n1. Get maximum value from hands like Qx\n2. Charge them heavily if they're drawing\n3. Potentially take down the pot now if they're weak\n\nWith 321 stack and 192 pot, I could go all-in here. That would be a strong play with trips, and it maximizes pressure on a passive opponent.\n\nLet"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 6s 8s (6-8 suited spades)\n**Board**: 6c 6d Qs\n**Position**: BTN (Button)\n**Stack**: 321 chips (20.1 BB)\n**Pot**: 192 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis**:\nI have trip sixes (6-6-6) with a Queen on board. This is a very strong hand - I have trips with an 8 kicker. The only hands that beat me are:\n- Pocket Queens (full house)\n- 6-X (where X > 8, giving me a lower kicker)\n- A higher pocket pair that makes a full house\n\n**Action Analysis**:\n- Preflop: Opponent raised from SB to 48, I called with 6s 8s\n- Flop: Opponent bets 80 into a pot of 112 (preflop: 16+48+48 = 112)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2)**:\nLooking at the recall data:\n- This opponent is relatively passive post-flop (lots of checking and folding)\n- They've shown down with weak hands like 4-4, 5-K, T-7\n- They raised preflop in hand 56, 60 (small raises)\n- They've folded to pressure multiple times\n- In hand 62, they called preflop and ended up with K-5 on a Q-4-2-6-Q board (two pair on river)\n\nThe current bet of 80 seems strong - it's about 72% of the pot. Given the board texture (paired board with a Queen), this could be:\n- A Queen (top pair)\n- A pocket pair (trying to protect against draws)\n- A 6 (trip sixes with better kicker)\n- Air (bluff)\n\n**Pot Odds**:\nI need to call 80 to win 192, which gives me 2.4:1 pot odds. I need about 29.4% equity to call.\n\n**Stack Considerations**:\n- I have 321 chips left (20.1 BB)\n- If I call, pot becomes 272 and I have 241 left\n- If I raise to 160 (minimum), I'm committing about half my stack\n\n**My Position**:\nI'm on the button, which is favorable. I have position post-flop.\n\n**Decision**:\nI have trips, which is a very strong hand. Given that my opponent has shown tendencies to be passive and fold to pressure, and given that I have a strong hand with position, I should raise here to:\n1. Get value from weaker hands (Queens, pocket pairs)\n2. Protect against draws (though there aren't many on this board)\n3. Put pressure on the opponent\n\nHowever, I need to consider that if they have a Queen, they might call. If they have a 6 with a better kicker, I'm in trouble. But given their passive nature, they might be betting a Queen or weaker hand.\n\nLooking at their showdown history, they play relatively weak hands. The 80 bet could be a protection bet with a Queen or medium pocket pair.\n\nI think raising is the best play. I can raise to 160 (minimum) or go all-in. Given my stack size and the pot size, a raise to 160 seems reasonable - it applies pressure but doesn't commit my entire stack yet.\n\nLet me reconsider - the pot is 192, they're betting 80. If I raise to 160, I'm giving them 2:1 odds to call. They might call with a Queen. If I go all-in for 321, I'm giving them about 1.6:1 odds.\n\nActually, with trips on a relatively dry board, I should be looking to get value. The opponent's bet of 80 suggests they have something. I should raise for value. Given my stack size and the pot size, I can raise to 200-240 to really put pressure on.\n\nBut wait - the minimum raise is 160. Let me think about the sizing:\n- Call 80: Pot becomes 272, I have 241 left\n- Raise to 160: Total investment 160, pot becomes 352 if they call, I have 161 left\n\nActually, if I raise to 160, that's only adding 80 more to their 80 bet, which is essentially a min-raise. That might not achieve much.\n\nGiven I have trips and position, and given the opponent's passive tendencies, I should raise bigger to:\n1. Get maximum value from hands like Qx\n2. Charge them heavily if they're drawing\n3. Potentially take down the pot now if they're weak\n\nWith 321 stack and 192 pot, I could go all-in here. That would be a strong play with trips, and it maximizes pressure on a passive opponent.\n\nLet",

          "reasoning_content": "  The user wants me to respond with a JSON object containing my action decision. Let me analyze the situation carefully:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: 6s 8s (trip sixes with 8 kicker)\n- Board: 6c 6d Qs\n- Position: BTN (button)\n- Stack: 321 chips (20.1 BB)\n- Pot: 192 chips\n- Opponent bet on flop: 80\n- Amount to call: 80\n- Minimum raise: 160\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have trip sixes (6-6-6-8-Q). This is a very strong hand, only beaten by:\n   - Pocket Queens (full house Q-Q-6-6-6)\n   - 6-X where X > 8 (better kicker)\n   - Higher pocket pairs that make a full house\n\n2. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the recall data, Kimi-K2 is relatively passive:\n   - Check-folds frequently on flop\n   - Makes small raises preflop (24 chips)\n   - Folds to pressure\n   - Has shown down weak hands\n\n3. **Current Action**: They raised preflop to 48 (from SB) and now bet 80 on flop (72% pot size)\n   - This could be a protection bet with a Queen\n   - Could be a pocket pair\n   - Could be a bluff\n   - Could be trip sixes with better kicker\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: Calling 80 to win 192 = 2.4:1, need ~29.4% equity\n\n5. **Stack Considerations**: I have 321 left. If I call, pot = 272, I have 241 left. If I raise to 160, pot = 352 if called, I have 161 left.\n\n6. **Position**: I'm on button, which is excellent\n\n**Decision**: I have a very strong hand (trips) against a passive opponent who is betting. I should raise for value and protection. Given my stack size and the pot size, and considering the opponent's passive nature, I should make a substantial raise.\n\nThe minimum raise is 160. Given that the opponent bet 80, raising to 160 is just a min-raise, which might not achieve much. I could raise more. \n\nLooking at my stack of 321, I could:\n- Raise to 200-240 to put real pressure\n- Go all-in for 321\n\nGiven the opponent's passive tendencies and the strength of my hand, I think raising to 200-240 is appropriate. However, the minimum raise is 160, and I need to specify the total amount I'm putting in.\n\nLet me think about the sizing more carefully. If I raise to 200:\n- I'm adding 120 to their 80 bet\n- Pot becomes 192 + 200 = 392\n- I have 121 left\n\nThis seems like a good sizing - it's substantial enough to get value and apply pressure, but doesn't commit my entire stack.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With trips on a board that's not too draw-heavy, I want to get value from hands like Qx, pocket pairs, etc. The opponent's 80 bet suggests they have something. I should raise for value.\n\nGiven the pot is 192 and they bet 80, and I have 321 behind:\n- A raise to 200-240 seems appropriate\n- Going all-in for 321 is also an option, maximizing pressure\n\nI think I'll raise to 200. This is a solid raise that:\n1. Gets value from weaker hands\n2. Applies pressure to a passive opponent\n3. Doesn't overcommit my stack if they have me beat\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Looking at the opponent's preflop raise from SB to 48, then betting 80 on this flop - this shows strength. They could have:\n- A Queen (top pair)\n- Pocket pair (trying to protect)\n- A 6 with better kicker\n- Air (bluff)\n\nGiven I have trip sixes with an 8 kicker, I'm losing to:\n- Pocket Queens (full house)\n- A6, K6, Q6, J6, T6, 96 (all have better kickers)\n- 66 (quad sixes)\n\nBut given the opponent's passive history, would they really bet 80 with just a 6? They might, but it's less likely. More likely they have a Queen or pocket pair.\n\nI have a strong hand and position. I should raise. Let me go with a raise to 200.",

It's suited in hearts but the 8 is low. \n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. I get to act last on every street.\n\n3. **Stack**: 513 chips (32.1 BB) - This is a healthy stack, above 30 BB.\n\n4. **Opponent**: Only one opponent left (Seat 2: Kimi-K2) with 162 chips (10.1 BB). This is a short stack.\n\n5. **Action**: \n   - Blinds are 8/16\n   - Pot is 24 chips\n   - I need to call 8 to see the flop (getting 3:1 odds)\n   - I can raise to minimum 32\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the opponent's history:\n   - They fold a lot preflop (hands 58, 61, 64, 65, 66, 67, 70)\n   - When they do play, they sometimes raise (hands 60, 69)\n   - In hand 69, they raised preflop to 48, then bet 80 on flop and folded\n   - They have shown down weak hands like Tc 7d, 4d 4s, 5s Kc\n   - They seem to play somewhat tight but can be aggressive\n\n7. **My recent BTN play**: I've been active on the button, sometimes raising, sometimes calling. I've won some decent pots.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - This is a heads-up situation (only me and one opponent with chips)\n   - The opponent has a short stack (10 BB)\n   - I have a healthy stack\n   - I should try to pressure the short stack\n\n**Decision**: With Ace-high on the button against a short stack, I should raise. This puts pressure on the short stack and gives me initiative. A standard raise would be to about 2.5-3x the BB, so around 40-48 chips. The minimum raise is 32, which is also reasonable.\n\nLet me raise to 40 or 48. Given the opponent's tendency to fold a lot, a raise to 40 (2.5x BB) should be enough to pressure them.",

Only raised once (hand 69) and bet on flop\n- Showdown hands: Tc7d, 4d4s, 5sKc - mixed holdings but generally tight\n- Conclusion: Ultra-tight player, only plays strong hands\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - BB:**\n- Recent actions: check, check, check, raise, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold\n- Pattern: Tight but more active than SB. Raised once (hand 65)\n- Showdown: 2sTs - weak hand but checked down\n- Conclusion: Tight player, but will defend BB sometimes\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 6h 3c is one of the worst starting hands in poker\n- Offsuit, no connectivity, low cards\n- Even in position, this hand has very poor equity\n- We're 33.6 BB deep - need to preserve chips\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** Extremely weak, bottom 5% of hands\n2. **Position:** BTN is good, but can't overcome hand weakness\n3. **Opponents:** Both tight players, SB especially nitty\n4. **Pot Odds:** Need to call 16 to win 24 = 40% immediate pot odds\n5. **Tournament:** We're in decent chip position, no need to gamble\n6. **Raise Option:** Could steal blinds, but both players are tight and may defend\n\n**Stealing Consideration:**\n- Could raise to 32-48 as a steal attempt\n- SB folds 90% of time based on history\n- BB folds 70% of time based on history\n- However, if called, we're in terrible shape postflop\n- Risk/reward isn't worth it with this hand\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, opponents are tight enough that stealing isn't profitable enough, and we don't need to take unnecessary risks with a healthy stack.\n\n**Action:** Fold",

It's offsuit and can be dominated by AQ, KQ, AJ.\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB, so I'll be out of position postflop.\n3. **Opponent**: The opponent has been raising preflop with a mix of hands including premiums (KK) and weaker hands. The raise size of 40 (2.5x BB) is moderate.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 24 to win 64, giving me about 2.67:1 odds. This is reasonable.\n5. **Stack sizes**: I have a healthy 32.6 BB stack, so I can afford to see flops.\n6. **Tournament**: With a medium stack, I should be looking to accumulate chips but not take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Decision**: \nQJo from BB facing a moderate raise from a player who seems to raise with a wide range. The pot odds are decent. However, being out of position with a hand that can be dominated is concerning.\n \nI see the raise is small enough to warrant a call. The 2.5x BB sizing suggests my opponent might have a weaker range, giving me a chance to see the flop without committing too many chips. The 24-chip call represents minimal risk to my 521-chip stack, allowing me to potentially outplay them postflop despite my positional disadvantage. I'll defend my blind and see what develops on the flop.",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand (#73) - FLOP:**\n- My position: BB (Seat 1)\n- My cards: Qh Js (Queen of hearts, Jack of hearts)\n- My stack: 497 chips (31.1 BB)\n- Board: 5h 7s 3c\n- Pot: 88 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n\n**Preflop action:**\n- Seat 3 posted SB (8 chips)\n- I posted BB (16 chips)\n- Seat 2 raised to 40 chips (24 more)\n- Seat 3 folded\n- I called 24 chips\n\nSo the flop action: It's checked to me (Seat 2 hasn't acted yet on the flop? Wait, let me re-read).\n\nActually, looking at the hand history again:\n- Preflop: Seat 2 raised to 40, Seat 3 folded, I called\n- Now we're on the flop\n- The \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests it's checked to me\n\nWait, the format says \"Actions this hand\" but only shows preflop actions. So on the flop, no one has acted yet. Since I'm BB and the action goes clockwise, Seat 2 (the preflop raiser) would act first on the flop. But the \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests it's checked to me, which means Seat 2 must have checked.\n\nSo the action is: Seat 2 checked, and now it's my turn.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- Qh Js on a 5h 7s 3c board\n- I have two overcards (Q and J)\n- No pair, no draw really (except backdoor flush draw with Qh)\n- The board is relatively dry and disconnected\n- My cards are suited (hearts) but the board has 5h only\n\n**Opponent analysis (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see Seat 2's recent actions:\n- Hand 72: Raised preflop to 154 (big raise), then checked down flop, turn, river (had KK)\n- Hand 69: Raised preflop to 48, bet 80 on flop, then folded\n- Hand 60: Raised preflop to 24\n- Hand 62: Called preflop 47\n- Hand 63: Called preflop 8, checked flop, folded to action\n- Many preflop folds\n\n**Key observations about Seat 2:**\n1. They raise preflop frequently (hands 60, 69, 72)\n2. When they have strong hands (like KK in hand 72), they check down postflop\n3. They sometimes c-bet (hand 69) but also give up\n4. Their stack is 276 chips (17.25 BB) - shorter than mine\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- I'm the preflop caller with a decent but not strong hand\n- The flop is very dry (5-7-3 rainbow essentially)\n- Seat 2 is the preflop aggressor but checked to me\n- This could mean:\n  a) They have a strong hand and are trapping\n  b) They missed the board and are giving up\n  c) They have a medium hand and want pot control\n\n- With QJs, I have two overcards which are good against many hands\n- If I bet, I might get folds from hands like AK, AQ, AJ that missed\n- If I check, I give a free card and might miss my overcard equity\n\n**Tournament context:**\n- I have a healthy stack (31.1 BB)\n- Opponent has 17.25 BB and is in \"medium stack\" territory\n- I should be looking to accumulate chips but also preserve my stack\n\n**Decision:**\nI think checking is the best option here. Here's why:\n1. I don't have a strong hand (just overcards)\n2. Seat 2 is the preflop aggressor - their check could be a trap with a strong hand\n3. If I bet, I risk getting check-raised which would put me in a tough spot\n4. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to realize my equity for free\n5. If the turn is a Q or J, I can get value then\n6. If the turn is a heart, I pick up a flush draw\n\nI could consider a small bet as a bluff, but against an unknown opponent who could be trapping, it's not worth the risk. The board is too dry for them to have hit much, but it's also too dry for me to represent much.\n\n**Final decision: Check**\n\nLet me format the JSON response:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n "

          "reasoning_content": "  The user is playing a poker hand and needs my decision. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand (#73) - FLOP:**\n- My position: BB (Seat 1)\n- My cards: Qh Js (Queen of hearts, Jack of hearts)\n- My stack: 497 chips (31.1 BB)\n- Board: 5h 7s 3c\n- Pot: 88 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n\n**Preflop action:**\n- Seat 3 posted SB (8 chips)\n- I posted BB (16 chips)\n- Seat 2 raised to 40 chips (24 more)\n- Seat 3 folded\n- I called 24 chips\n\nSo the flop action: It's checked to me (Seat 2 hasn't acted yet on the flop? Wait, let me re-read).\n\nActually, looking at the hand history again:\n- Preflop: Seat 2 raised to 40, Seat 3 folded, I called\n- Now we're on the flop\n- The \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests it's checked to me\n\nWait, the format says \"Actions this hand\" but only shows preflop actions. So on the flop, no one has acted yet. Since I'm BB and the action goes clockwise, Seat 2 (the preflop raiser) would act first on the flop. But the \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests it's checked to me, which means Seat 2 must have checked.\n\nSo the action is: Seat 2 checked, and now it's my turn.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- Qh Js on a 5h 7s 3c board\n- I have two overcards (Q and J)\n- No pair, no draw really (except backdoor flush draw with Qh)\n- The board is relatively dry and disconnected\n- My cards are suited (hearts) but the board has 5h only\n\n**Opponent analysis (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see Seat 2's recent actions:\n- Hand 72: Raised preflop to 154 (big raise), then checked down flop, turn, river (had KK)\n- Hand 69: Raised preflop to 48, bet 80 on flop, then folded\n- Hand 60: Raised preflop to 24\n- Hand 62: Called preflop 47\n- Hand 63: Called preflop 8, checked flop, folded to action\n- Many preflop folds\n\n**Key observations about Seat 2:**\n1. They raise preflop frequently (hands 60, 69, 72)\n2. When they have strong hands (like KK in hand 72), they check down postflop\n3. They sometimes c-bet (hand 69) but also give up\n4. Their stack is 276 chips (17.25 BB) - shorter than mine\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- I'm the preflop caller with a decent but not strong hand\n- The flop is very dry (5-7-3 rainbow essentially)\n- Seat 2 is the preflop aggressor but checked to me\n- This could mean:\n  a) They have a strong hand and are trapping\n  b) They missed the board and are giving up\n  c) They have a medium hand and want pot control\n\n- With QJs, I have two overcards which are good against many hands\n- If I bet, I might get folds from hands like AK, AQ, AJ that missed\n- If I check, I give a free card and might miss my overcard equity\n\n**Tournament context:**\n- I have a healthy stack (31.1 BB)\n- Opponent has 17.25 BB and is in \"medium stack\" territory\n- I should be looking to accumulate chips but also preserve my stack\n\n**Decision:**\nI think checking is the best option here. Here's why:\n1. I don't have a strong hand (just overcards)\n2. Seat 2 is the preflop aggressor - their check could be a trap with a strong hand\n3. If I bet, I risk getting check-raised which would put me in a tough spot\n4. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to realize my equity for free\n5. If the turn is a Q or J, I can get value then\n6. If the turn is a heart, I pick up a flush draw\n\nI could consider a small bet as a bluff, but against an unknown opponent who could be trapping, it's not worth the risk. The board is too dry for them to have hit much, but it's also too dry for me to represent much.\n\n**Final decision: Check**\n\nLet me format the JSON response:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n ",

Better to preserve 30BB stack for better opportunities.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Kd 7d - This is a marginal hand. It's suited, which gives some potential for flushes, but the King is dominated by many hands (any Ace, any King with a better kicker). It's not a great hand to play, especially out of position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB (small blind), which is the worst position post-flop. I'll be acting first on every street.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 489 chips (30.6 BB). This is a healthy stack, so I can afford to be selective.\n\n4. **The action**: \n   - Blinds are 8/16\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised to 122 (a large raise of about 7.6x the big blind)\n   - I need to call 114 to see the flop\n   - Pot will be 146 + 114 = 260 if I call\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for DeepSeek-V3.2:\n   - They folded preflop in hands 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73 (6 out of 7 recent hands)\n   - They called in hand 72 with Qc Ah (a premium hand)\n   - They showed down 2s Ts in hand 64 and Qc Ah in hand 72\n   - This suggests they're playing very tight - only entering pots with strong hands\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 114 to win 260, which is about 2.3:1 pot odds. This is not great for a marginal hand like K7s.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 30BB, I should be looking for better spots. K7s from SB against a tight player's large raise is not a profitable situation.\n\n8. **Hand equity**: K7s has about 35-40% equity against a typical raising range from a tight player (which would include big pairs, AK, AQ, etc.). The pot odds don't justify this call, especially out of position.\n\nThe raise size of 122 from a player who usually folds suggests they have a very strong hand. My K7s is easily dominated and I'm out of position. This is a clear fold.",

Also made a smaller raise in hand 73 (40 chips). So capable of raises with strong hands.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB): Very tight - has folded preflop in hands 68, 69, 70, 71, 73. Only played hand 72 (called 138 chips with AQ) and made a raise in hand 74 (122 chips). So when they play, they seem to have strong hands.\n\n**Stack Sizes**: \n- I have 489 chips (30.6 BB) - healthy stack\n- Seat 2 has 340 chips (21.25 BB)\n- Seat 3 has 130 chips (8.1 BB) - short stack\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With a 30 BB stack, I should be selective. 46o is a trash hand that doesn't warrant a call even with good position, especially against opponents who play tight/strong ranges.\n\n**Pot Odds**: Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1). Not relevant with such a weak hand.\n\nThis is a clear fold. The opponents play tight ranges when they enter pots, and 46o has virtually no equity against any reasonable calling/raising range. Even on the button, this is not a profitable call.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Th 6c (Ten of hearts, six of clubs) - This is a very weak hand, unsuited, not connected, and my ten is not strong enough to call raises with.\n\n**Position**: BB (Big Blind) - Not great, but I'm already invested with 16 chips.\n\n**Stack**: 473 chips (29.6 BB) - Healthy stack, tournament situation.\n\n**Current action**:\n- SB posted 8\n- BB (me) posted 16\n- Seat 2 raised to 48\n- Seat 3 re-raised to 122\n\n**Pot**: 186 chips\n**Amount to call**: 106 chips\n**Minimum raise to**: 196 chips\n\n**Opponent analysis from recent actions**:\n\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n- Has been raising preflop frequently (hands 72, 73, 75, 76)\n- In hand 72, raised 154 with KK (showdown)\n- In hand 73, raised 40 and bet flop\n- Seems like an aggressive player who raises with strong hands\n- Has 316 chips (19.75 BB)\n\nSeat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2):\n- Usually folds preflop (hands 69, 70, 71, 73, 75)\n- In hand 72, called 138 preflop with AQ (showdown)\n- In hand 74, raised 122 preflop (this is the same raise size as current hand!)\n- Has only 8 chips left (0.5 BB) - this is a short stack\n\n**Key insight**: Seat 3 is extremely short stacked with only 8 chips (0.5 BB). They're making a raise to 122 which is putting them all-in or almost all-in. This suggests they have a strong hand and are trying to get value before they get blinded out.\n\n**Hand evaluation**: Th 6c is a trash hand. I should be folding this 100% of the time in a normal situation.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 106 to win 186 \u2192 106/(186+106) = 106/292 = 36.3% equity needed.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have a healthy stack (29.6 BB)\n- Seat 3 is desperate with 0.5 BB\n- Seat 2 is aggressive and likely has a strong hand\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. I have a terrible hand, I'm facing aggression from two players, one of whom is desperate and likely has a strong hand. Even if I had pot odds, T6o is never going to have enough equity against two players' ranges. \n\nThis is especially true given that Seat 3 is short-stacked and making a big raise (relative to their stack), which typically indicates strength. I should preserve my tournament chips and wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"T6o is a very weak hand with no connectivity or suitedness.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Jh 5s - This is a weak hand, offsuit, not connected, not a premium hand.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Good position, but with a weak hand this doesn't help much.\n\n**Stack**: 465 chips (29.1 BB) - This is a decent stack, not desperate.\n\n**Blinds**: 8/16 - It's early in the hand.\n\n**Pot**: 24 chips\n\n**To Call**: 8 chips (half a big blind)\n\n**Opponent**: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) with 218 chips (13.6 BB)\n\nLooking at the opponent's history:\n- They've been quite active with raises (hands 73, 75, 76)\n- They raised to 40, 48, 48 in recent preflop actions\n- They showed down pocket Kings (KK) in hand 72\n- They showed down Td Qc in hand 76\n- They folded in hand 74 preflop\n\nThis opponent seems to be playing relatively aggressively, raising frequently preflop. They have a short stack (13.6 BB) and might be looking to get their money in.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, which is 3:1 odds. This is good pot odds.\n\n**Hand analysis**: Jh 5s is a terrible hand. Even with good pot odds, this hand has very little equity against any reasonable raising range. It's offsuit, not connected, and the Jack is weak without a kicker.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 29.1 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities. Calling here would be burning chips.\n\n**If I call**: \n- I'm out of position postflop (opponent is in BB)\n- I have a weak hand that will rarely hit strongly\n- I'll likely face aggression from this opponent\n- Even if I hit a Jack, I'll be dominated by better Jacks\n- If I hit a 5, it's unlikely to be good\n\n**If I raise**: \n- Minimum raise is to 32, which is 2 BB\n\n\n- Raising would commit too many chips with a weak hand\n- Opponent's aggressive nature means they might re-raise\n- I'd be risking valuable chips unnecessarily\n\nThe most prudent move is to fold. Despite tempting pot odds, the hand's fundamental weakness and opponent's aggressive tendencies make this an easy decision. I'll wait for a stronger hand to invest my chips.",

It can make straights and flushes, but is weak against typical raising ranges.\n2. **Position**: Being on BTN is great - I get to act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent stacks**: Both are short-stacked. If I hit a strong hand, I can potentially win their entire stacks.\n4. **Preflop action**: Just blinds posted, no raises yet.\n5. **Tournament situation**: I'm in good chip position. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position.\n\n**Key insight**: Since both opponents are short-stacked and I have position, calling 16 chips (1 BB) to see a flop with a suited connector is reasonable. The implied odds are good because:\n- If I hit a strong hand (flush, straight, two pair), I can potentially win 234-244 chips\n- I'm only investing 16 chips (1 BB)\n- I'm in position, which gives me control postflop\n\nHowever, I should also consider that these opponents have shown they can be aggressive, and 85s is easily dominated. But given the price (just 1 BB), position, and potential to win short stacks, I think calling is slightly better than folding.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking at the opponent data more carefully:\n- Seat 2 raises frequently and can be aggressive postflop\n- Seat 3 makes big raises (122 chips) when they enter\n- Both have shown they can play strong hands\n\n85s is a very marginal hand. While the price is cheap and position is good, I'm not getting great immediate pot odds (40% equity needed), and 85s typically has much less equity against typical raising ranges.\n\nGiven that both opponents are short-stacked and likely to shove or play aggressively, and that 85s is a weak hand that will often be dominated or drawing thin, I think the correct play is to **fold**. \n\nThe tournament consideration is key here - while I have a healthy stack, preserving chips and waiting for better spots is important. 85s is just too weak to play against two opponents where I'll often be dominated.\n\nWait, but no one has raised yet - it's just the blinds. So I can see the flop for 16 chips. Let me think about the EV:\n\n- If I call 16 chips, I can potentially win 234-244 chips (14-15x my investment)\n- I need to hit a strong hand - I'll flop a flush draw ~11%, a straight draw ~10%, two pair ~2%\n- Combined, I have decent equity to continue on the flop\n\nGiven I'm in position, the cheap price, and the potential to win short stacks, I think **calling** is actually the better play. I can easily fold if I miss the flop,"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: 8d 5d (offsuit, not suited - wait, they ARE suited! 8\u26665\u2666)\n**Position**: BTN (best position)\n**Stack**: 465 chips (29.1 BB)\n**Blinds**: 8/16\n**Pot**: 24 chips\n**To call**: 16 chips\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 234 chips (14.6 BB) - relatively short stacked\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 244 chips (15.25 BB) - also short stacked\n\n**Analysis of opponent tendencies**:\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**:\n- Very active preflop: has raised multiple times (hands 69, 72, 73, 75, 76)\n- Shows aggression with bets on flop (hands 69, 73, 76)\n- Has folded to pressure sometimes (hand 69 flop fold)\n- Showdown hands: Tc7d, 4d4s, 5sKc, KhKs, TdQc - wide range, including premium pairs\n- Seems to play a wide range aggressively\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**:\n- More selective: mixes raises and folds preflop\n- When they raise, they go bigger (122 chips in hands 74, 76)\n- More passive postflop: lots of checking\n- Showdown hands: 2sTs, QcAh, KcTs - seems to play some speculative hands and strong hands\n- Called a big raise in hand 72 (138 chips) with AQ\n\n**Current situation**:\n- I'm on the BTN with 8\u26665\u2666 (suited connector)\n- Both opponents have short stacks (~15 BB)\n- I have a healthy stack of 29 BB\n- Pot odds: 16 to win 24 = 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed to call\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 85s is a speculative hand. It can make straights and flushes, but is weak against typical raising ranges.\n2. **Position**: Being on BTN is great - I get to act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent stacks**: Both are short-stacked. If I hit a strong hand, I can potentially win their entire stacks.\n4. **Preflop action**: Just blinds posted, no raises yet.\n5. **Tournament situation**: I'm in good chip position. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position.\n\n**Key insight**: Since both opponents are short-stacked and I have position, calling 16 chips (1 BB) to see a flop with a suited connector is reasonable. The implied odds are good because:\n- If I hit a strong hand (flush, straight, two pair), I can potentially win 234-244 chips\n- I'm only investing 16 chips (1 BB)\n- I'm in position, which gives me control postflop\n\nHowever, I should also consider that these opponents have shown they can be aggressive, and 85s is easily dominated. But given the price (just 1 BB), position, and potential to win short stacks, I think calling is slightly better than folding.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking at the opponent data more carefully:\n- Seat 2 raises frequently and can be aggressive postflop\n- Seat 3 makes big raises (122 chips) when they enter\n- Both have shown they can play strong hands\n\n85s is a very marginal hand. While the price is cheap and position is good, I'm not getting great immediate pot odds (40% equity needed), and 85s typically has much less equity against typical raising ranges.\n\nGiven that both opponents are short-stacked and likely to shove or play aggressively, and that 85s is a weak hand that will often be dominated or drawing thin, I think the correct play is to **fold**. \n\nThe tournament consideration is key here - while I have a healthy stack, preserving chips and waiting for better spots is important. 85s is just too weak to play against two opponents where I'll often be dominated.\n\nWait, but no one has raised yet - it's just the blinds. So I can see the flop for 16 chips. Let me think about the EV:\n\n- If I call 16 chips, I can potentially win 234-244 chips (14-15x my investment)\n- I need to hit a strong hand - I'll flop a flush draw ~11%, a straight draw ~10%, two pair ~2%\n- Combined, I have decent equity to continue on the flop\n\nGiven I'm in position, the cheap price, and the potential to win short stacks, I think **calling** is actually the better play. I can easily fold if I miss the flop,",

Despite opponent's history of frequent raises, risking nearly half my stack with this hand is not a profitable tournament play. Preserve stack for better spots.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- My hand: Jd 2d (Jack of diamonds, 2 of diamonds) - a very weak hand, offsuit but both diamonds\n- My position: BB (Big Blind)\n- My stack: 473 chips (29.6 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 258 chips\n- Amount to call: 218 chips\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 in Seat 2\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent actions from Seat 2 (Kimi-K2), I can see:\n- They have a history of frequent raises preflop (hands 69, 72, 73, 75, 76)\n- They raised to 234 chips this hand, which is essentially all-in (they have 234 chips total based on the raise amount)\n- In previous hands, they've shown down: Tc7d, 4d4s, 5sKc, KhKs, TdQc\n- Their raise sizes vary: 40, 48, 154, 234\n- They seem to raise with a wide range including weak hands like Tc7d and medium pairs like 44\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nJd 2d is a very weak hand. Even though they're both diamonds (suited), the ranks are very low. This hand has very poor equity against almost any raising range.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot before call: 258 chips\n- Amount to call: 218 chips\n- Pot odds: 258:218 or about 1.18:1\n- Required equity: 218/(258+218) = 218/476 = 45.8%\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: J2s is extremely weak. Even against a wide raising range, this hand is a significant underdog.\n2. **Stack Size**: I have 473 chips, which is healthy at 29.6 BB. Calling 218 chips would cost me 46% of my stack.\n3. **Opponent Tendency**: Opponent appears to raise frequently and with a wide range. However, this specific raise to 234 chips (essentially all-in) suggests significant strength or a desperate move.\n4. **Tournament Consideration**: I'm not short-stacked. Risking 46% of my stack with J2s is not a good tournament play.\n\n**Equity Calculation:**\nEven if opponent is raising with a very wide range (like top 50% of hands), J2s has roughly 30-35% equity. I need 45.8% equity to make this call profitable based on pot odds.\n\nThe only consideration is that the opponent might be making a desperate move with a very wide range. But even then, J2s is just too weak to call off nearly half my stack.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, the cost is too high relative to my stack, and I don't have the required equity even against a wide raising range.",

I have Q3 offsuit (clubs). It's a weak hand. I'm on the button, which is good position.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**:\nI recalled actions for \"Kimi-K2\" (the opponent in Seat 2). Let me review their tendencies:\n\nFrom the data:\n- Hand 66: preflop fold\n- Hand 67: preflop fold\n- Hand 69: preflop raise 48, flop bet 80, then fold (they raised, bet big, then folded)\n- Hand 70: preflop fold\n- Hand 71: preflop fold\n- Hand 72: preflop raise 154 (big raise), check flop, check turn, check river (went to showdown)\n- Hand 73: preflop raise 40, flop bet 48\n- Hand 74: preflop fold\n- Hand 75: preflop raise 48\n- Hand 76: preflop raise 48, then call 74 (someone raised them), flop bet 74\n- Hand 78: preflop fold\n- Hand 79: preflop raise 234 (very big raise)\n\nShowdowns: None (empty array)\n\nSo this opponent has been raising a lot preflop:\n- Raises in hands: 69, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79\n- Folds in hands: 66, 67, 70, 71, 74, 78\n\nThey seem to be playing quite aggressively preflop, raising frequently. The raise sizes vary: 48, 154, 40, 48, 48, 234. They seem to like raising to about 3x BB (48 is 3x 16 BB), but sometimes make big raises (154, 234).\n\nThey also seem to continuation bet on the flop when they raise preflop (hands 69, 73, 76).\n\nHowever, I don't have showdown data, so I don't know what hands they had when they raised.\n\n**My Hand**: Q3 offsuit (clubs). This is a very weak hand. Q-high is not good. The 3 is a low kicker. Even though they're suited (clubs), the suit doesn't matter much unless I hit a flush, which is unlikely.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position postflop. However, since the opponent is in the big blind and has already posted 16, and I only need to call 8 more, the pot odds are attractive.\n\n**Pot Odds**: Pot is 24 (my SB 8 + opponent's BB 16). I need to call 8. So I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (24:8). That's 25% equity needed to break even.\n\n**My Stack**: 465 chips (29.1 BB). This is a healthy stack. I can afford to fold and preserve my stack.\n\n**Opponent's Stack**: 242 chips (15.1 BB). They're shorter stacked than me.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: This is a tournament. Stack preservation is important, but so is accumulating chips. With a medium stack (29 BB), I should be somewhat selective.\n\n**Decision Factors**:\n1. **Hand Strength**: Very weak. Q3 offsuit is a fold in most situations.\n2. **Position**: Good (button), but hand is too weak.\n3. **Opponent's Tendency**: They raise frequently preflop. If I call, they might raise (but they already posted BB and haven't raised yet this"

I have Q3 offsuit (clubs). It's a weak hand. I'm on the button, which is good position.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**:\nI recalled actions for \"Kimi-K2\" (the opponent in Seat 2). Let me review their tendencies:\n\nFrom the data:\n- Hand 66: preflop fold\n- Hand 67: preflop fold\n- Hand 69: preflop raise 48, flop bet 80, then fold (they raised, bet big, then folded)\n- Hand 70: preflop fold\n- Hand 71: preflop fold\n- Hand 72: preflop raise 154 (big raise), check flop, check turn, check river (went to showdown)\n- Hand 73: preflop raise 40, flop bet 48\n- Hand 74: preflop fold\n- Hand 75: preflop raise 48\n- Hand 76: preflop raise 48, then call 74 (someone raised them), flop bet 74\n- Hand 78: preflop fold\n- Hand 79: preflop raise 234 (very big raise)\n\nShowdowns: None (empty array)\n\nSo this opponent has been raising a lot preflop:\n- Raises in hands: 69, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79\n- Folds in hands: 66, 67, 70, 71, 74, 78\n\nThey seem to be playing quite aggressively preflop, raising frequently. The raise sizes vary: 48, 154, 40, 48, 48, 234. They seem to like raising to about 3x BB (48 is 3x 16 BB), but sometimes make big raises (154, 234).\n\nThey also seem to continuation bet on the flop when they raise preflop (hands 69, 73, 76).\n\nHowever, I don't have showdown data, so I don't know what hands they had when they raised.\n\n**My Hand**: Q3 offsuit (clubs). This is a very weak hand. Q-high is not good. The 3 is a low kicker. Even though they're suited (clubs), the suit doesn't matter much unless I hit a flush, which is unlikely.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position postflop. However, since the opponent is in the big blind and has already posted 16, and I only need to call 8 more, the pot odds are attractive.\n\n**Pot Odds**: Pot is 24 (my SB 8 + opponent's BB 16). I need to call 8. So I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (24:8). That's 25% equity needed to break even.\n\n**My Stack**: 465 chips (29.1 BB). This is a healthy stack. I can afford to fold and preserve my stack.\n\n**Opponent's Stack**: 242 chips (15.1 BB). They're shorter stacked than me.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: This is a tournament. Stack preservation is important, but so is accumulating chips. With a medium stack (29 BB), I should be somewhat selective.\n\n**Decision Factors**:\n1. **Hand Strength**: Very weak. Q3 offsuit is a fold in most situations.\n2. **Position**: Good (button), but hand is too weak.\n3. **Opponent's Tendency**: They raise frequently preflop. If I call, they might raise (but they already posted BB and haven't raised yet this",

          "role": "assistant",
          "content": "  Looking at the opponent's raising history:\n- They have a pattern of raising preflop frequently\n- Recent raises: 48, 154, 40, 48, 48, 234 (this hand)\n- The huge raise of 154 in hand #72 was with KK (pocket Kings)\n- The raise of 234 in hand #79 (previous hand) was also large\n- They seem to make large raises with strong hands\n\nLooking at their showdowns:\n- Hand #72: KK (very strong)\n- Hand #76: Td Qc (decent but not premium)\n- Other hands show they play various hand strengths\n\nThe current raise to 250 (from the SB) is a massive overbet relative to their stack of 16 chips. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read the table information.\n\nActually, looking at the table:\nSeat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\n\nIf they only have 16 chips, they can't raise to 250. There must be an error in my reading. Let me look again:\n\n\"Your Stack: 433 chips (13.5 BB)\"\n\"Blinds: 16/32\"\n\nWait, blinds are 16/32, so:\n- Small blind = 16\n- Big blind = 32\n\nSo the \"16 chips\" next to Seat 2 might be their action (posting SB), not their stack size. Let me re-read the table format:\n\n\"Players at table:\n  Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 433 chips\n  Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\n  Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 204 chips (folded)\n  Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (folded)\n  Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (folded)\"\n\nThe format seems to be: Seat #: Name - Stack size (status)\n\nSo Seat 2 has 16 chips total. But then they raise to 250? That doesn't make sense unless they went all-in for 16, but the raise is stated as 250.\n\nLet me reconsider. Maybe the \"16 chips\" is how much they posted for the small blind, not their stack. But that would be unusual formatting.\n\nActually, wait - if blinds are 16/32, and I have 433 chips which is 13.5 BB, then:\n433 / 32 = 13.5 BB approximately. Yes.\n\nSo the numbers after the names are stack sizes. But then how can Seat 2 raise to 250 if they only have 16 chips?\n\nLet me look at the action again:\n\"preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 16\"\n\"preflop: Seat 1 call 32\"\n\"preflop: Seat 2 raise 250\"\n\nMaybe the \"raise 250\" means a raise OF 250, not TO 250. But that would be even more impossible with 16 chips.\n\nOR... maybe the \"16 chips\" shown is their stack AFTER posting the SB? Let me check:\nIf they posted 16 as SB, and they have 16 chips left, that would mean they started with 32 chips. But that seems very short.\n\nActually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me just work with what's given:\n- Pot is 314\n- I need to call 218\n- The raise is to 250 total for the SB\n\nThe key facts are:\n1. I have 7s 5s - a low suited connector\n2. I need to call 218 to win a pot of 314 (immediate odds)\n3. If I call, final pot will be 532\n4. I'm getting about 1.44:1 odds, needing ~41% equity\n5. My hand is weak against any standard raising range\n6. Opponent has shown they make large raises with strong hands (KK in hand #72)\n7. This is a tournament, and I have 13.5 BB - I'm in the danger zone but not desperate yet\n\nWith 7-5 suited, even against a wide range, I likely have:\n- ~35-40% equity against a wide 30% range\n- ~25-30% equity against a tighter 15% range\n- ~20-25% equity against a strong 5% range\n\nGiven the large raise size and the opponent's history of big raises with strong hands, I think I'm up against a strong range. Even if they're raising wide, I'm not getting the right odds.\n\nAlso, tournament ICM considerations: at 13.5 BB, I should be relatively tight. This is not a good spot to gamble with a weak hand.\n\nDecision: FOLD\n\nLet me double-check the math:\n- Pot: 314\n- Call: 218\n- Odds: 314/218 = 1.44:1\n-"

Against a typical raising range, I'm in bad shape.\n\nLet me think about the opponent:\nSeat 2 has only 16 chips initially, but they raised to 250. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If they only have 16 chips, they can't raise to 250.\n\nLet me re-read",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent's raising history:\n- They have a pattern of raising preflop frequently\n- Recent raises: 48, 154, 40, 48, 48, 234 (this hand)\n- The huge raise of 154 in hand #72 was with KK (pocket Kings)\n- The raise of 234 in hand #79 (previous hand) was also large\n- They seem to make large raises with strong hands\n\nLooking at their showdowns:\n- Hand #72: KK (very strong)\n- Hand #76: Td Qc (decent but not premium)\n- Other hands show they play various hand strengths\n\nThe current raise to 250 (from the SB) is a massive overbet relative to their stack of 16 chips. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me re-read the table information.\n\nActually, looking at the table:\nSeat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\n\nIf they only have 16 chips, they can't raise to 250. There must be an error in my reading. Let me look again:\n\n\"Your Stack: 433 chips (13.5 BB)\"\n\"Blinds: 16/32\"\n\nWait, blinds are 16/32, so:\n- Small blind = 16\n- Big blind = 32\n\nSo the \"16 chips\" next to Seat 2 might be their action (posting SB), not their stack size. Let me re-read the table format:\n\n\"Players at table:\n  Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 433 chips\n  Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 16 chips\n  Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 204 chips (folded)\n  Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (folded)\n  Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (folded)\"\n\nThe format seems to be: Seat #: Name - Stack size (status)\n\nSo Seat 2 has 16 chips total. But then they raise to 250? That doesn't make sense unless they went all-in for 16, but the raise is stated as 250.\n\nLet me reconsider. Maybe the \"16 chips\" is how much they posted for the small blind, not their stack. But that would be unusual formatting.\n\nActually, wait - if blinds are 16/32, and I have 433 chips which is 13.5 BB, then:\n433 / 32 = 13.5 BB approximately. Yes.\n\nSo the numbers after the names are stack sizes. But then how can Seat 2 raise to 250 if they only have 16 chips?\n\nLet me look at the action again:\n\"preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 16\"\n\"preflop: Seat 1 call 32\"\n\"preflop: Seat 2 raise 250\"\n\nMaybe the \"raise 250\" means a raise OF 250, not TO 250. But that would be even more impossible with 16 chips.\n\nOR... maybe the \"16 chips\" shown is their stack AFTER posting the SB? Let me check:\nIf they posted 16 as SB, and they have 16 chips left, that would mean they started with 32 chips. But that seems very short.\n\nActually, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me just work with what's given:\n- Pot is 314\n- I need to call 218\n- The raise is to 250 total for the SB\n\nThe key facts are:\n1. I have 7s 5s - a low suited connector\n2. I need to call 218 to win a pot of 314 (immediate odds)\n3. If I call, final pot will be 532\n4. I'm getting about 1.44:1 odds, needing ~41% equity\n5. My hand is weak against any standard raising range\n6. Opponent has shown they make large raises with strong hands (KK in hand #72)\n7. This is a tournament, and I have 13.5 BB - I'm in the danger zone but not desperate yet\n\nWith 7-5 suited, even against a wide range, I likely have:\n- ~35-40% equity against a wide 30% range\n- ~25-30% equity against a tighter 15% range\n- ~20-25% equity against a strong 5% range\n\nGiven the large raise size and the opponent's history of big raises with strong hands, I think I'm up against a strong range. Even if they're raising wide, I'm not getting the right odds.\n\nAlso, tournament ICM considerations: at 13.5 BB, I should be relatively tight. This is not a good spot to gamble with a weak hand.\n\nDecision: FOLD\n\nLet me double-check the math:\n- Pot: 314\n- Call: 218\n- Odds: 314/218 = 1.44:1\n-",

          "reasoning_content": "  The current situation:\n- I'm on the Button (BTN)\n- My cards: Qd 9s - this is a marginal hand, not very strong\n- My stack: 401 chips (12.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 220 chips\n- Amount to call: 156 chips\n- Minimum raise to: 344 chips\n\nLet me analyze:\n1. Hand strength: Q9 offsuit is a weak hand, especially in this situation\n2. Position: I'm on the button which is good position, but that doesn't help much with this weak hand\n3. Opponent: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has only 16 chips left and raised to 188. This is a massive overbet relative to their stack - they're essentially all-in or committing themselves. They posted the small blind and now raised big.\n4. Pot odds: I need to call 156 to win 220, which is about 1.4:1 pot odds. This is not great.\n5. Tournament considerations: I have 12.5 BB, which is a short stack but not desperate yet. Calling here would cost me 156/401 = 39% of my stack. If I lose, I'll be down to 245 chips (7.6 BB). If I win, I'll be at 557 chips (17.4 BB).\n\nGiven that DeepSeek-V3.2 only has 16 chips, their raise to 188 is strange. They posted 16 as SB, so they have 0 chips left after posting? Wait, let me check again:\n- Seat 3 posted SB 16\n- They have 16 chips total\n- They raised to 188\n\nThis doesn't make sense mathematically. If they have 16 chips and posted 16, they should have 0 left. Let me re-read...\n\nOh wait, the format might be showing their starting stack. Let me think about this differently. The player list shows:\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 16 chips\n\nSo they started the hand with 16 chips. They posted SB of 16, which would put them all-in automatically. But then it says \"preflop: Seat 3 raise 188\". This is contradictory.\n\nActually, looking more carefully, I think the \"16 chips\" might be their remaining stack AFTER posting the SB. So:\n- They had 32 chips to start\n- Posted SB 16, leaving 16\n- Then they raised to 188... which is impossible\n\nHmm, maybe the formatting means something else. Let me consider that they have 16 chips remaining and the raise to 188 is going all-in for their 16 chips plus the 16 they already posted = 32 total? No, that doesn't match either.\n \nI'm puzzled by the raise amount. The numbers don't add up - a player with only 16 chips can't raise to 188. There might be a misunderstanding about the chip counts or raise mechanics. The discrepancy suggests I need more information about the exact chip distribution and raise rules.\n\nThe raise puts me in a tough spot. With Q9 offsuit, I'm looking at marginal pot odds of 1.4:1. My stack would take a significant hit if I call and lose. The hand's strength doesn't justify the risk, especially against what looks like a strong hand from the opponent. I'm likely facing a premium hand like a high pocket pair or strong broadway cards.\n\nFolding seems the most prudent move to preserve my tournament life and wait for a better opportunity.",

Let me analyze:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- Cards: 2c Jc (Jack-2 suited) - weak hand, but suited\n- Stack: 385 chips (12 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the data for \"Kimi-K2\" (the BB), I can see:\n- They've been fairly active with raises preflop (hands 69, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79, 81)\n- They fold sometimes too (hands 70, 71, 74, 78, 82)\n- They make substantial raises (48, 154, 234, 250 chips)\n- In hand 76, they raised to 48, then called a re-raise to 74, then bet 74 on flop\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm on the button with 12 BB - this is a critical stack size\n- The other active player (Kimi-K2 in BB) has 298 chips (9.3 BB) - also short\n- I need to be looking for spots to accumulate chips\n- J2s is marginal but from the button with a short stack, it could be playable\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 48, I need to call 16\n- Getting 3:1 immediate odds\n- With 12 BB stack, calling 16 is 0.5 BB - not a huge portion\n\n**Decision:**\nWith J2s on the button and a short stack (12 BB), this is a fold. Here's why:\n1. J2s is a very weak hand, even suited\n2. While I have position, I'm out of position postflop against the BB\n3. The BB has shown aggression with raises\n4. With 12 BB, I should be more selective and look for better spots\n5. The suitedness gives some potential, but not enough to justify calling with this stack size\n\nI should fold and preserve my chips for a better opportunity. I need to be pushing all-in or folding with this stack size, not calling marginal hands.",

I have:\n1. **Hand strength**: AJ suited is a premium hand, especially in position\n2. **Position**: Button gives me advantage post-flop\n3. **Stack size**: 12 BB is short but I can still make a standard raise\n4. **Opponents**: SB is aggressive but can be bullied, BB is tight/passive\n\nGiven my short stack of 12 BB, I should be looking to either:\n- Fold and preserve chips (too weak for AJ)\n- Call and see a flop (not ideal with short stack)\n- Raise to apply pressure and potentially win preflop\n\nWith AJ suited on the button, I should raise. A standard raise would be 2.5-3x the BB, so about 80-96 chips. Since minimum raise is 64, I could raise to around 96 (3x BB).\n\nHowever, I need to consider that if I raise to 96 and get re-raised, I might have to fold or commit. With 12 BB, I could also consider a shove (all-in for 385) which would apply maximum pressure.\n\nLet me think about this:\n- If I raise to 96 (3x BB), I'm putting in about 25% of my stack\n- If I get re-raised, I'll likely have to fold, losing 25% of my stack\n- If I shove, I win the 48 chips in the pot if both fold (12.5% of my stack)\n- If called, I have a strong hand with good equity\n\nGiven the aggressive nature of SB and that I have a strong hand on the button, I think a standard raise is better than shoving. Shoving might only get called by better hands, while a raise might get folds from weaker hands or allow me to fold if re-raised.\n\nLet me raise to 96 (3x BB).",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**My hand**: 2s 5d - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and not connected.\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - Good position, but that doesn't help much with this terrible hand.\n\n**Stack**: 433 chips (13.5 BB) - This is a short stack in tournament play, getting close to the danger zone.\n\n**Blinds**: 16/32 - The big blind is 32 chips.\n\n**Pot**: 48 chips\n\n**Action**: I'm in the small blind position (posting 16), and I need to call 16 more to see the flop. Seat 2 is the big blind.\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Looking at the opponent actions for Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n- They fold quite often preflop (hands 70, 71, 74, 78, 82, 84, 85)\n- When they do raise, they raise to significant amounts (154, 234, 250 chips in recent hands)\n- They've shown some aggression with pocket pairs and good hands (showdown with Kh Ks in hand 72)\n- They seem to play relatively tight-aggressive\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 13.5 BB, I'm in the short stack territory. I need to be selective with my hands and look for spots to either steal blinds or get all-in with decent equity. \n\n**Hand equity**: 2-5 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. It has very little equity against any random hand, and even less against typical raising ranges.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 48, which is 3:1 pot odds. But even with these odds, 2-5 offsuit is just too weak. \n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Even though I'm getting 3:1 pot odds, 2-5 offsuit has such poor equity that it's not worth investing even 16 chips. With a short stack of 13.5 BB, I need to preserve my chips for much better spots. The opponent in the big blind has shown they can raise big, and even if they just check, I'm out of position post-flop with a terrible hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

Not a strong hand at all.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Good position, last to act post-flop.\n\n**Stack**: 385 chips (12.0 BB) - This is a short stack but not desperate yet.\n\n**Opponents**: \n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 222 chips (6.9 BB) - very short stacked\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 280 chips (8.75 BB) - also short stacked\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**:\n- Very active preflop with multiple raises (hands 79, 81, 87, 88)\n- Showdown hands include: 44, K5, KK, TQ, 2K\n- Seems to play a wide range, including weak hands like K2o, TQo, 44\n- Recently raised to 378 in hand 88 (which was almost all-in with ~12 BB)\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**:\n- Much more conservative, mostly folding preflop\n- Only raised once (hand 82 for 188) and called once (hand 88 for 140)\n- Showdown hands: 2T, QA, KT, AQ - stronger hands than Seat 2\n- Seems to play tighter, premium hands\n\n**Analysis**:\n- I have 8s5s which is a weak hand, but I'm on the button\n- Both opponents are short-stacked and may be looking to get their money in\n- Seat 2 is very aggressive and could raise/shove with a wide range\n- Seat 3 is tighter and would likely only call/raise with strong hands\n- Pot is 48, I need to call 32 to see flop (1.5:1 pot odds)\n- My hand has some potential if I hit a straight or flush, but it's very marginal\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have 12 BB which is short but workable\n- I should be selective with my hands\n- 8s5s is generally a fold from any position with a short stack\n\nThe only argument for calling is that I'm on the button and both opponents are short-stacked, so I might be able to steal the pot post-flop if they show weakness. However, with such a weak hand and short stack, it's better to preserve chips.\n\nI think this is a clear fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My Hand**: 5d 5c - Pocket 5s, a small pocket pair\n2. **Position**: SB (Small Blind) - out of position post-flop\n3. **Stack**: 385 chips (12 BB) - getting short but not desperate yet\n4. **Current situation**: \n   - Blinds: 16/32\n   - Pot: 144 chips\n   - Amount to call: 80 chips\n   - Facing a raise from DeepSeek-V3.2 in Seat 3\n\n5. **Opponent analysis (DeepSeek-V3.2)**:\n   - Looking at their preflop actions, they fold a LOT (hands 77, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 91)\n   - They've only raised preflop a few times: hands 76 (122), 82 (188), and now hand 92 (96)\n   - They called once in hand 88 (140)\n   - Showdowns show they've played Kc Ts, As Qc, Qc Ah - so they can have decent hands\n\n6. **My recent SB play**: I've been folding a lot from SB, only raising once in hand 71 with Ah 8s\n\n7. **Pot odds**: Need to call 80 to win 144, so about 1:1.8 or ~36% equity needed\n8. **Tournament situation**: 12 BB is getting short. Pocket pairs have good all-in equity against most ranges\n\nGiven that DeepSeek folds most of the time but has raised 3 times now, their range is likely strong but not necessarily premium. With 12 BB from SB, pocket 5s is a decent hand to defend or even reshove with.\n\nI could:\n- Fold: Conservative, preserves 369 chips (11.5 BB)\n- Call: Potentially set-mine but out of position with only 12 BB, which is not ideal\n- Raise/Shove: 3-bet all-in for 385 total\n\nWith 12 BB, calling 80 (2.5 BB) to set mine is not great since I won't have enough chips behind to get paid off if I hit. The better play is likely to either fold or shove.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature (lots of folds), a shove might get them to fold some decent hands. And if they call, pocket 5s has decent equity against their range.\n\nLet me calculate: If I shove 385, they're calling 289 more into a pot of 144+80+289 = 513, so they'd be getting ~1.8:1 on a call.\n\nI think the best play here is to shove. It puts maximum pressure and with 12 BB and a pocket pair, it's a standard tournament play.",

Very low unsuited cards with no connectivity.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is good, but with this hand it doesn't matter much.\n\n3. **Opponent stacks**: Both opponents are very short stacked (under 7 BB).

Even though I'm getting decent pot odds (32 to win 48, or 1.5:1), and I'm in position, 2-9 offsuit is just too weak to play, especially against short stacks who are likely to shove.\n\nThe only consideration is that both opponents are very short and might fold, allowing me to steal the blinds. However, with 16.5 BB, I still have some play left and shouldn't risk chips with such a weak hand. The BB is very tight and might fold, but the SB has shown aggression and could easily shove.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have Kc 8c - suited but not connected, King-high. This is a marginal hand, especially out of position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB (worst position post-flop)\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 481 chips (15 BB) - short stack but not desperate yet\n\n4. **Action**: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised to 168, which is 5.25x BB. This is a large raise.\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at the recall data for DeepSeek-V3.2:\n   - Very tight player - folds most hands\n   - Only raised once before (hand #92) and then folded\n   - Called once (hand #88) with A Q and showed down\n   - When they show down, they have strong hands (AQ, KTs)\n   - This is an unusually large raise from a tight player\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is 216\n   - I need to call 152\n   - Pot odds: 216:152 or ~1.42:1\n   - This means I need ~41% equity to call profitably\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I'm one of the bigger stacks left (Seat 2 has 238, I'm at 481)\n   - Losing 152 chips would leave me with 329 (10.3 BB) - still playable\n   - But committing 1/3 of my stack with K8s out of position against a tight player's big raise is questionable\n\n8. **Implied odds**: Not great with K8s. If I hit a King, I could be dominated by better kickers. If I hit a flush, it could be second-best.\n\nGiven that DeepSeek-V3.2 is very tight and just made a large 5.25x raise, they're likely holding a premium hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK, AQ, JJ). My K8s is in bad shape against that range.\n\nThe pot odds aren't good enough to justify calling with this hand out of position, especially given the opponent's tight profile. I should fold and preserve my chips.\n\nHowever, let me consider if a re-raise (shove) could be an option. If I shove 481, the pot would be 697, giving Seat 3 about 1.45:1 odds to call. Against a tight player's range, I'm likely behind. And if they fold, I only win 216 chips. The risk/reward isn't great.\n\nBest play: **FOLD**",

Not connected, not suited, and the Q is dominated by many hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is good position, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 15 BB, which is in the \"short stack\" territory. At this stack depth, I should be playing very tight and looking for spots to shove or fold. Calling with marginal hands is generally bad with a short stack.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - SB has 222 chips (6.9 BB) - very short\n   - BB has 184 chips (5.75 BB) - very short\n   - Two players are already out\n\n5. **Tournament Consideration**: With 15 BB, I need to be selective. The SB and BB are both very short and might bust soon. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 32 to win 48, which is 1.5:1 odds. This would require 40% equity to be profitable. Q4o doesn't have that against any reasonable range.\n\n**Decision**: This is an easy fold. Q4o is just too weak to play, especially with a short stack. I should wait for a better hand or a better spot (like when the blinds are even shorter and I can pressure them).\n\nI don't need to recall any opponent actions here - this is a straightforward fold based on hand strength and stack size.",

My hand: Jc 6h - This is a weak hand, unsuited and not connected. Very poor starting hand.\n\n2. Position: I'm on the BTN (Button), which is good position, but with a terrible hand this doesn't help much.\n\n3. Opponent tendencies: The opponent in BB (seat 2) has been raising preflop frequently - many raises of 48, 96, 222, 234, 250, 378 chips. They've shown aggression with a wide range. They also have some folds mixed in. Their stack is 238 chips (7.4 BB), so they're in shove/fold territory.\n\n4. Pot odds: I need to call 16 chips to win 48 chips, getting 3:1 odds. But with J6o, even these odds aren't good enough against an aggressive opponent who is likely to raise.\n\n5. Tournament considerations: I have 481 chips (15 BB). I'm not desperate yet, but I need to be careful. The opponent in BB has a shorter stack and might shove over my call.\n\nGiven that:\n- My hand is extremely weak (J6o)\n- The BB opponent is aggressive and likely to raise\n- I have a medium stack that I should preserve\n- The opponent has shown many preflop raises and could easily shove over my call\n\nI should fold this hand. The 16 chip call might seem small, but against an aggressive opponent with a shorter stack, I'm likely to face a raise that I'll have to fold to, or I'll be playing a weak hand out of position postflop (if they just check).\n\nEven with 3:1 pot odds, J6o is just too weak to play profitably here, especially against an aggressive opponent who will likely apply pressure.",

Very low cards, not suited, no straight potential unless you hit a 2-4-6 board which is extremely unlikely.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button which is good position, but that doesn't justify playing such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data, I can see that Kimi-K2 in Seat 2 (SB) has been raising frequently preflop with amounts like 48, 96, 222, 234, 250, 378. This suggests they're aggressive and willing to put chips in. They've also folded many times. The pattern shows they raise with a wide range.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 481 chips (15 BB)\n   - SB (Seat 2): 270 chips (8.4 BB) - short stack\n   - BB (Seat 3): 136 chips (4.25 BB) - very short stack\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 15 BB, I'm in the \"push/fold\" territory or close to it. I should be selective with my hands. 3-5 offsuit is definitely a fold.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 to win 48 (pot) = 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not enough to justify playing 3-5 offsuit.\n\n7. **Risk vs reward**: If I call, I'm putting in 2 BB with a terrible hand. The SB is aggressive and could easily raise me out of the pot, or the BB could shove their short stack. There's no upside here.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, my stack is too shallow to play marginal hands, and the pot odds don't justify it. I should save my chips for better spots.",

It's in the bottom 20% of starting hands.\n\n2. **Position**: BB (Big Blind) - I'm out of position against the raiser.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 449 chips (14 BB) - This is a short stack in tournament play.\n\n4. **The action**: \n   - SB posted 16\n   - I posted BB 32\n   - Seat 2 raised to 318 (this is a huge raise, about 10x the BB)\n   - SB folded\n   - I need to call 286 to win a pot of 366\n\n5. **Pot odds**: 366:286 = approximately 1.28:1, which means I need about 44% equity to break even on a call.\n\n6. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at Seat 2's history:\n   - They raise frequently preflop (many raise actions)\n   - Their raise sizes vary widely (48, 96, 222, 234, 250, 270, 378)\n   - They showed down some strong hands: KK, Kd2h, TdQc, 5sKc, 4d4s, KhKs\n   - This appears to be an aggressive player who raises with a wide range but has shown down some legitimate hands\n\n7. **Tournament situation**: With 14 BB, I'm in a critical spot. This is a large portion of my stack (286/449 = 64% of my stack).\n\n8. **Hand equity**: 5s7h has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a very wide range, this hand is likely <30% equity.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. My hand is terrible, I'm out of position, the raise is huge relative to the blinds and my stack, and I don't have the pot odds to call. Folding preserves my 14 BB stack for a better spot.",

Let me analyze this hand carefully.\n\nFirst, let me understand the situation:\n- This is Hand #101 - PREFLOP\n- My position: BTN (Button, Seat 1)\n- My cards: 3c Jd (Jack of diamonds, 3 of clubs)\n- My stack: 417 chips (6.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 96 chips\n- Players at table:\n  - Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 417 chips (me)\n  - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 302 chips (BB)\n  - Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 120 chips (folded)\n  - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (folded)\n  - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (folded)\n\nActions this hand:\n- preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 32 (me posting small blind)\n- preflop: Seat 2 post_bb 64 (big blind)\n- preflop: Seat 3 fold\n\nAmount to call: 32 (I need to put in 32 more to complete the big blind)\nMinimum raise to: 128\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nWait, let me re-read the \"Amount to call: 32\". I posted 32 as small blind, big blind is 64, so I need to call 32 more to match the big blind.\n\nMy hand: J3 offsuit. This is a very weak hand, especially with a short stack of 6.5 BB.\n\nLet me think about the key factors:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: J3o is terrible. It's not connected, not suited, and the Jack is weak. This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Stack size**: I have 417 chips, which is 6.5 BB. This is a short stack but not desperate yet. In tournament poker, with 6.5 BB, I need to be very selective about which hands I play. I should be looking for spots to shove all-in or fold, not call raises.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position postflop. However, with such a short stack and a weak hand, position advantage is minimal.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 96 chips (32 + 64), and I need to call 32 more. That's 3:1 pot odds (96:32). But this is irrelevant with such a weak hand and short stack.\n\n5. **Opponent**: The big blind has 302 chips (4.7 BB), also a short stack. If I raise, they might shove. If I call, I'm out of position postflop (wait, I'm on the button, so I would be in position postflop). Actually, if I just call the 32, I would see the flop in position with 385 chips left (6 BB).\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 6.5 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. J3o is not a hand I want to invest chips in. The risk of losing more chips far outweighs the potential reward.\n\n7. **ICM considerations**: Not relevant here as it's early in the tournament and no immediate bubble considerations.\n\n8. **Opponent tendencies**: I should recall information about this opponent. The opponent is \"Kimi-K2\" in the big blind. Let me search for recall information about this opponent.\n\nActually, let me think about whether I should even use the recall tool. The hand is very straightforward - I have a terrible hand and a short stack. The correct play is clearly to fold. I don't need opponent history to know that J3o is not worth playing with 6.5 BB.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any argument for calling or raising:\n- **Calling 32**: I'd be investing 32 chips to see a flop with J3o. Even if I hit a Jack, I'm often dominated by better Jacks. If I hit a 3, it's unlikely to be good. The pot would be 128 chips, and I'd have 385 left. Not worth it.\n- **Raising**: Minimum raise is to 128. If I raise to 128, I'm investing 96 more chips. With a weak hand, this is spewing chips. I could also consider shoving all-in for 417, but that's a terrible idea with J3o.\n\nThe clear, obvious, correct decision is to **fold**.\n\nWait, let me double-check the situation. I posted the small blind of 32. The big blind posted 64. The action came to me after Seat 3 folded. I need to put in 32 more to call. \n\nWith"

This suggests an aggressive player who likes to steal blinds.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I'm on the Button, the best position\n- I have Qs 6c - a very weak hand, offsuit and not connected\n- My stack is 417 chips (6.5 BB) - very short\n- Pot is 96 chips\n- I need to call 64 chips\n- The small blind (Seat 2) and big blind (Seat 3) are the only players left\n\nWith a 6.5 BB stack, I should be looking for spots to shove all-in with decent hands. However, Q6o is a terrible hand even for a shove. \n\nThe pot odds are 96:64 or 1.5:1, which means I need ~40% equity to call. Q6o typically has much less equity against any reasonable range.\n\nGiven my short stack, I should preserve my chips for a better spot. Q6o is simply not strong enough to call or raise here, even with position.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better hand or situation.",

I'm extremely short stacked (5.5 BB)\n2. I have a pocket pair on the button\n3. The opponent is tight but just raised big from SB\n4. This is likely a shove or fold decision\n\nWith pocket 5s and 5.5 BB, against a tight player who just raised from SB, this is a marginal spot. The opponent's raise sizing suggests strength. However, with such a short stack and a pocket pair, I should probably shove here. The opponent might be raising with a wide range given the short stack dynamics.\n\nWait, let me reconsider - the opponent only has 32 chips total and raised to 208. That's not possible. Let me re-read...\n\nActually, looking at the players:\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 32 chips\n- They posted SB of 32 (all their chips)\n- Then they raised to 208... but they only have 32 chips?\n\nThis seems like the raise is to 208 total, but they only have 32 chips, so the raise would actually be all-in for 32. Let me think about this differently.\n\nIf they have 32 chips and posted 32 as SB, they have 0 chips left. But the action says they raised to 208. This is confusing.\n\nActually, re-reading: \"Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 32 chips\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32\". So they posted their entire stack as the small blind, then raised to 208? That doesn't make sense.\n \nI'm facing a critical decision with pocket 5s and an extremely short stack. The opponent's raise is puzzling, but my tournament life is on the line. With only 5.5 BB, I need to make a bold move. The pot odds are tempting, and my position on the button gives me some advantage. I'll calculate my potential equity and consider the tight opponent's range. A shove might be my best chance to double up and stay alive in the tournament.\n\nThe key factors are my low chip count, decent hand, and the potential to force a difficult decision on the small blind. I'll need to weigh the risks carefully before committing my entire stack.\n\nIf the small blind has already committed their 32 chips, they're effectively all-in. This means my call of 144 chips could significantly impact my remaining stack of 209 chips. The pot size of 272 chips makes this a critical decision point in the tournament.\n\nI need to carefully consider the potential outcomes. Calling would leave me with 209 chips, but I'd want to understand the exact implications of the small blind's previous action and how it affects the current betting round.\n\nThe tight player's range and my current short stack create a complex strategic scenario. My pocket pair of 5s offers some potential, but the risk-reward calculation is tight. With limited information, I'm leaning towards a cautious fold to preserve my remaining chips.\n\nThe opponent's raise represents significant strength, and my pot odds aren't compelling enough to justify calling with a marginal hand. Even on the button, 5.5 BB doesn't give me much flexibility. Folding seems the most prudent move to maintain my tournament life.\n\nI'm tracking the opponent's pattern: they've shown strength with previous"

I'm extremely short stacked (5.5 BB)\n2. I have a pocket pair on the button\n3. The opponent is tight but just raised big from SB\n4. This is likely a shove or fold decision\n\nWith pocket 5s and 5.5 BB, against a tight player who just raised from SB, this is a marginal spot. The opponent's raise sizing suggests strength. However, with such a short stack and a pocket pair, I should probably shove here. The opponent might be raising with a wide range given the short stack dynamics.\n\nWait, let me reconsider - the opponent only has 32 chips total and raised to 208. That's not possible.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**My hand:** 5c 5h (pocket fives)\n**Position:** Button\n**Stack:** 353 chips (5.5 BB)\n**Blinds:** 32/64\n**Pot:** 272 chips\n**Action:** Seat 3 (SB) posted 32, then raised to 208\n**Amount to call:** 144 chips\n**Legal actions:** fold, call, raise\n\nWait, I need to reconsider the chip counts. It says Seat 3 has 32 chips and posted SB of 32. If they posted 32 as SB, they'd have 0 left. But then they raised to 208. This seems inconsistent.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Perhaps the \"32 chips\" is their stack AFTER posting the SB? No, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: \"Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 32 chips\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32\". This suggests they have 32 chips total and posted 32 as SB. Then the raise to 208 must be an error in the data, OR it means they're raising to 208 total which would be all their chips (32) plus something else? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me reconsider: perhaps the \"32 chips\" shown is their stack size at the start of the hand, they posted SB of 32 (leaving them with 0), and the raise to 208 is actually what they're raising TO, but they can only put in 32 total. So effectively they're all-in for 32.\n\nBut the amount to call is shown as 144. If the SB posted 32 and then raised to 208, that means they're raising 176 more (208-32 = 176). But they only have 32 chips. This is confusing.\n\nLet me try another interpretation: The \"32 chips\" shown for Seat 3 might be incorrect or outdated. If they raised to 208, they must have at least 208 chips. The amount to call is 144, which is 208 - 64 (my BB). \n\nActually, I should just focus on the key facts:\n\n\nI'm facing a critical decision with a short stack and pocket fives. The pot is substantial at 272 chips, but calling 144 chips represents a significant portion of my remaining 353-chip stack. With a tight opponent raising from the small blind, this becomes a high-risk, marginal spot. The hand history suggests my opponent plays conservatively, making their raise more meaningful. Given my limited stack and the unfavorable pot odds, folding appears to be the most prudent decision to preserve my tournament life.\n\nThe tight player's range likely includes higher pairs and strong aces, which puts my pocket fives at a distinct disadvantage. With only 5.5 big blinds remaining, I need to be extremely selective about my confrontations. The potential risk outweighs the potential reward in this scenario.\n\nMy stack size suggests a shove or fold strategy, and calling with a marginal hand like pocket fives doesn't align with optimal short-stack play. The pot odds are not compelling enough to justify risking a significant portion of my remaining chips.\n\nI need to preserve my limited stack for a more favorable opportunity, making a fold the most prudent decision in this situation.",

This is a decent hand, especially on the button.\n2. **Position**: BTN (Button) - Best position post-flop.\n3. **Stack**: 321 chips = 5.0 BB - This is a very short stack, in tournament push/fold territory.\n4. **Blinds**: 32/64 - High blinds relative to my stack.\n5. **Pot**: 96 chips.\n6. **To call**: 32 (half of big blind, since I posted small blind).\n7. **Legal actions**: fold, call, raise.\n\nWith only 5 big blinds, I'm in a critical tournament situation. I should be looking for spots to either go all-in or fold. Ace-Jack suited is definitely strong enough to play with this stack size.\n\nOptions:\n- **Fold**: Too weak for AJs with 5BB on the button\n- **Call**: I could just call 32, but that would leave me with 289 chips (4.5 BB) and I'd be out of position post-flop against the BB\n- **Raise**: With 5BB, the standard play is to shove all-in. This gives me fold equity and maximizes my chances to double up.\n\nLet me think about the opponent in BB (Seat 2) with 214 chips (3.3 BB). They're also short-stacked. They might call with a wide range including any pair, any Ace, any King, any Queen, and some suited connectors.\n\nWith AJs, I have about 60% equity against a random hand, and even against a calling range like 22+, A2s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KJo+, I still have decent equity.\n\nSince the minimum raise is 128 and I have 321, and this is a tournament with 5BB, the correct play is to shove all-in for 321 chips. This maximizes fold equity and gives me the best chance to accumulate chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - the minimum raise is 128, but with 321 chips (5BB), I should either fold or go all-in. A standard raise to 128 would leave me with 193 chips (3BB) and committed to the pot anyway. Better to shove.\n\nThe action should be: raise to 321 (all-in).",

Let me re-read:\n\n\"Blinds: 32/64\" - So small blind is 32, big blind is 64.\n\n\"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - 11 chips is way less than 1 big blind (64 chips). This means we're extremely short-stacked.\n\nBut then it says \"Pot: 224 chips\" - how can the pot be 224 chips if the blinds are 32/64 and we're the BB with only 11 chips?\n\nLet me trace the actions:\n- Seat 3 (SB) posts 32\n- Seat 1 (BB, us) posts 64 - but we only have 11 chips. This is impossible.\n\nWait, the user says \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - 11 chips is 0.2 of a 64-chip big blind, so 0.2 * 64 = 12.8, close to 11. So yes, we have 11 chips total.\n\nBut then \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 64\" - we cannot post 64 chips if we only have 11 chips. This is contradictory.\n\nLet me re-read more carefully: \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - maybe the BB is 64, but we have 11 chips left AFTER posting? Or maybe the tournament uses different blind structure?\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. Maybe the \"11 chips\" is a typo or the blinds are in a different unit. Let me look at the pot size: \"Pot: 224 chips\"\n\nIf blinds are 32/64:\n- SB posts 32\n- BB posts 64\nTotal from blinds = 96 chips\n\nBut the pot is 224 chips, which is much larger. Then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 128\" - so someone raised to 128.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- SB posts 32\n- BB posts 64\n- Seat 2 raises to 128 (this is a raise of 64 over the BB of 64)\n\nIf everyone calls, the pot would be:\n- SB: 32\n- BB: 64\n- Seat 2: 128\nTotal: 224 chips\n\nAh! So \"Pot: 224 chips\" is the current pot size AFTER the raise to 128 and before any action from us.\n\nNow, \"Amount to call: 64\" - we posted 64 as BB, and someone raised to 128, so we need to put in 64 more to call.\n\nBut wait: \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - we only have 11 chips total. We cannot call 64 chips.\n\nThis is extremely contradictory. Let me think about what could be happening:\n\n1. Maybe the \"11 chips\" is a mistake and we actually have more\n2. Maybe the \"0.2 BB\" is a mistake and we have more chips\n3. Maybe the blind structure is different than I think\n4. Maybe this is a tournament where the BB is 5 chips or something, making 11 chips = 0.2 BB\n\nLet me look at the numbers again:\n- If BB is 64, then 0.2 BB = 0.2 * 64 = 12.8 chips\n- If we have 11 chips, that's roughly 0.17 BB\n\nBut the user explicitly says \"Blinds: 32/64\" and \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\".\n\nWait, maybe the \"(0.2 BB)\" is a calculation error by the system, and we actually have more chips"

This means I cannot possibly call - I can only fold or go all-in for my remaining 11 chips if that's an option.\n\nBut the user says \"Legal actions: fold, call\" - no raise/all-in option is listed. However, in poker, if you don't have enough to call, you can go all-in for whatever you have left.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The \"Amount to call: 64\" might be a display error, or it might mean I need to put in 64 more chips total (but I only have 11). In reality, if I only have 11 chips, I can go all-in for 11.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: 224 chips. This suggests:\n- SB posted 32\n- BB posted 64\n- Seat 2 raised to 128\n- Total: 32 + 64 + 128 = 224\n\nSo the action is on me in the BB. I posted 64, and Seat 2 raised to 128. I need to call 64 more chips to see the flop.\n\nBut I only have 11 chips left after posting the BB? Wait, that doesn't make sense either. If I had to post BB of 64, I must have had at least 64 chips to start the hand.\n\nLet me re-read: \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - maybe this means I have 11 big blinds, not 11 chips? No, it says \"11 chips\" and then \"(0.2 BB)\" as a conversion.\n\nI think there might be an error in the hand description. However, I must make a decision based on what's given. Let me assume the key facts are:\n1. I have a very short stack (0.2 BB = very short)\n2. I have Qd Jd in the BB\n3. Someone raised to 128\n4. I need to call 64 more\n5. I only have legal actions: fold, call\n\nGiven that I have Qd Jd, this is a decent hand, especially when short-stacked. From the BB, this is definitely a hand I should play, especially if I can see a flop cheaply relative to my stack.\n\nBut wait - if I truly only have 11 chips and need to call 64, that's impossible. The system must be allowing me to call for my remaining 11 chips (all-in).\n\nLet me think about the tournament situation:\n- I'm extremely short-stacked (0.2 BB)\n- Qd Jd is a strong hand in this spot\n- The pot is already 224 chips\n- If I win, I quadruple up or more\n- Tournament survival is important, but with 0.2 BB, I need to make a move soon\n\nWith Qd Jd, I should definitely go all-in here. It's a premium hand for a short stack, and I have good equity against most ranges.\n\nHowever, the user says \"Legal actions: fold, call\" - no raise option. But if I only have 11 chips and need to call 64, my only realistic option is to go all-in for 11, which should be treated as a call of 11.\n\nLet me make a decision: I should go all-in with Qd Jd here. It's a strong hand, I'm extremely short-stacked, and I need to accumulate chips or go home.\n\nThe reasoning should be: I have a suited connector QJ with good playability, I'm extremely short-stacked at 0.2 BB, and this is a good spot to shove and try to double/triple up.\n\nBut the format requires me to choose from fold, call, or raise. Since raise isn't listed as a legal action, but I need to put in all my chips, I think \"call\" is the appropriate action here (calling for my remaining stack).\n\nActually, let me reconsider: if the amount to call is 64 and I only have 11, I cannot call 64. In poker rules, I would be all-in for 11. The system should allow this as a \"call\" action that puts me all-in.\n\nSo my decision is: call (all-in for my remaining 11 chips).\n\nReasoning: With Qd Jd and only 0.2 BB left, this is"

Fold - too tight, we have position and an ace\n2. Call - reasonable, see a flop in position\n3. Raise - also reasonable, we can steal blinds or build pot with our hand\n\nWith no opponent history and being on the button, I think raising is the best play. A standard raise would be 3x the BB, which is 6 chips total. Since minimum raise is 4, we can raise to 6.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The minimum raise to is 4, which means total amount to put in. Since the BB is 2, a minimum raise would be to 4 total (2 more). A standard 3x raise would be to 6 total.\n\nGiven we have no reads on opponents and are on the button with A6o, I think a standard raise to 6 (3x BB) is appropriate.

Let me think about this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A6s is a marginal hand, especially facing 3-bets. It's dominated by many hands (AK, AQ, AJ, AT, A9, A8, A7). The suitedness helps but it's still weak.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is good position, but I'm facing aggression from both blinds.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: No history available, so I have to assume standard play.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is currently 69 chips, I need to call 39, so I'm getting about 1.77:1 odds. This isn't great for a marginal hand.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 97 BB, I'm in decent shape. Calling here would commit about 20% of my stack with a marginal hand facing two opponents showing strength. This seems like a -EV play.\n\nThe action suggests both opponents have strong hands. Seat 2 (SB) made a significant 3-bet, and Seat 3 (BB) 4-bet even larger. A6s is just too weak to continue here, especially out of position post-flop if I call.\n\nI should fold.",

Even against two random hands, Q2o only has about 35% equity, but against actual raising ranges it's much worse (likely 20-25% at best).\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** I have no data on these specific opponents yet since the search returned no results.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** \n- It's early in the tournament (Hand #4)\n- I have a healthy stack\n- There's already significant aggression (3-bet to 12)\n- I'm out of position\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. Q2o is a trash hand, I'm out of position, facing a 3-bet, and the implied odds are terrible. Even if I hit a Q, I'll often be dominated, and if I hit a 2, I'll rarely get paid off. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify calling with such a weak hand, and I don't want to get involved in a bloated pot out of position with a marginal hand.\n\nI should fold and preserve my chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand**: 7h Ts (7 of hearts, 10 of spades)\n- This is a marginal hand. It's suited but not connected (gap of 3 cards)\n- It's a \"trouble hand\" - often dominated by better tens or dominated by overcards\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is excellent position, last to act post-flop\n**Stack**: 191 chips (95.5 BB) - Healthy stack\n**Blinds**: 1/2\n**Pot**: 3 chips\n**Amount to call**: 2 chips\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - Based on history, they've been folding a lot (folded in hands 3, 4, 5), called once, and raised once then folded. Seems somewhat tight.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - More aggressive, has raised multiple times (hands 1, 3), but also folded recently (hands 4, 5). Mixed strategy.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Weak. 7-T offsuit is not a strong starting hand. It's easily dominated by T-J, T-Q, T-K, T-A, and any pair.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is great, but with a weak hand like this, position advantage is limited unless we hit a very specific flop.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: We're getting 1.5:1 pot odds (calling 2 to win 3). This is not great for a hand this weak.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - SB seems to be playing somewhat tight recently (folded 3 out of last 4 hands)\n   - BB is more aggressive but has also folded recently\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 95.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots like this. I should preserve my chips for better situations.\n\n6. **Implied odds**: Very low. If I hit a T, I could be dominated. If I hit a 7, it's rarely good. The only good scenario is hitting two pair or a straight, which is very unlikely.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This hand is too weak to play from any position, even on the button. The pot odds aren't good enough, and we risk being dominated even when we hit. Let's wait for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I need to make a decision with pocket 8s from UTG position. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- **Cards:** 8s 8d - Pocket 8s, a medium pocket pair\n- **Position:** UTG (Under the Gun) - Worst position, will act first post-flop\n- **Stack:** 191 chips (95.5 BB) - Healthy stack\n- **Action:** Facing a 2 chip call from the big blind\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** Pocket 8s is a medium-strength hand. It's strong preflop but vulnerable to overcards.\n2. **Position:** UTG is the worst position. I'll be out of position against everyone.\n3. **Stack Size:** With 95.5 BB, I have room to play, but tournament considerations matter.\n4. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the recall, I see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has been calling and betting small amounts\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) made a raise in hand #5\n   - Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) made a raise in hand #7\n\n**Strategic Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Too conservative. Pocket 8s is too strong to fold UTG with this stack.\n2. **Call:** Passive play, lets me see flop cheaply but with no initiative.\n3. **Raise:** Standard play. I should raise to:\n   - Build the pot when I likely have the best hand\n   - Get value from worse hands\n   - Define opponent ranges\n   - Take control of the hand\n\n**Raise Sizing:** Standard UTG raise is 3-4x the big blind. With 2 BB blind, I should raise to 6-8 chips. Given it's a tournament and I want to keep the pot manageable from early position, I'll go with 3x = 6 chips.\n\n**Conclusion:** Raise to 6 chips. This is a standard, solid play with pocket 8s from early position.",

This is a premium hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is an early position but I'm closing the preflop action.\n\n3. **Opponent action**: MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4 raised to 4. Looking at their history:\n   - They've been relatively tight, folding many hands preflop\n   - They made a similar small raise in Hand #4 (raise to 4, then re-raised to 20)\n   - In Hand #4 they showed aggression postflop with bets on flop and turn\n   - They called in Hand #5 but with small bets postflop\n   - Overall, they seem to play relatively conservatively but can be aggressive\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 7 chips (1 from SB, 2 from BB, 4 from raiser). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop, which gives me great pot odds.\n\n5. **Stack sizes**: I have 192 chips (96 BB), which is a healthy stack. MiniMax-M2 has 239 chips, so they're also deep-stacked.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With pocket Kings, I want to build the pot and extract value. I don't want to just call and let them see a cheap flop with speculative hands.\n\nGiven I have pocket Kings against a player who has shown they can raise but also folds frequently, I should:\n- Definitely not fold\n- Calling is too weak with KK - I want to build the pot\n- Raising is the correct play to:\n  - Extract value from weaker hands\n  - Define their hand range\n  - Take control of the hand\n\nThe minimum raise is to 6 chips (total), which is only a min-raise. With KK, I should make a more substantial raise. A standard raise would be 3x their raise (12 chips) or more. Given I'm out of position, I might want to raise even larger, perhaps 15-20 chips total.\n\nLet me make a solid raise to build the pot and protect my hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- Hand 1: Folded preflop on BTN\n- Hand 2: Checked in BB, then folded to flop bet\n- Hand 3: Folded UTG\n- Hand 4: Raised from BB, then made multiple bets postflop and won\n- Hand 5: Called from SB, then bet twice postflop and won\n- Hand 6: Folded on BTN\n- Hand 7: Folded in CO\n- Hand 8: Folded UTG\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems like a tight-aggressive player. They don't play many hands (folded most preflop), but when they do play, they tend to be aggressive with bets and raises. They 3-bet me here from 16 to 28 (a min-raise), which could indicate strength but could also be a re-steal attempt.\n\nWith pocket Kings in the BB, I have a premium hand. The action:\n- MiniMax-M2 raised to 4 (2x BB, a small raise)\n- I 3-bet to 16 (4x their raise)\n- They 4-bet to 28 (min-raise)\n\nI need to decide whether to call, raise, or fold. Folding is out of the question with KK. Calling would be 12 more chips. Raising would be at least 40 total (minimum raise).\n\nLet me think about stack sizes:\n- Me: 178 chips\n- MiniMax-M2: 215 chips\n\nPot is currently 45 chips. If I call, pot becomes 57. If I raise to 40, that's putting in 24 more than calling.\n\nWith KK, I should generally be happy to get all the chips in preflop, especially against a player who can be aggressive. However, I should consider:\n1. This is a tournament, so stack preservation matters\n2. MiniMax-M2 is tight, so their 4-bet range is likely very strong (AA, KK, maybe QQ or AK)\n3. If they have AA, I'm in bad shape\n4. If they have QQ or AK, I'm in great shape\n\nGiven that I have position (I'm BB, they're BTN/CO), and I have a premium hand, I think I should re-raise to put pressure on them. A 5-bet would show tremendous strength.\n\nLet me calculate: minimum raise to 40 means I put in 40 total. The pot would be 45 + 24 (my additional raise) = 69 if they call.\n\nActually, wait. Let me re-read the action:\n- Preflop: Seat 4 (MiniMax) raised to 4\n\n\n- I raised to 16\n- They raised to 28\n\nI'm facing a 12 chip call to see a flop. The 40 chip raise represents a significant escalation in the hand's intensity. This move would clearly communicate my hand's strength and potentially force a difficult decision for MiniMax-M2. The 40 chip raise is a strategic play that puts maximum pressure on my opponent while protecting my premium hand.\n\nThe total pot calculation reveals the potential impact: a 40 chip raise would create a 69 chip pot, with me investing 40 chips. This represents a substantial commitment that could define the tournament's progression.\n\nI'm carefully weighing the implications of a 5-bet, considering the strategic nuances of tournament poker and the potential range of my opponent's hand.\n\nWith a strong pocket pair, I'm leaning towards an aggressive re-raise. My stack size allows for a substantial 5-bet that could pressure my opponent, especially given their positional disadvantage. The key is balancing strength with strategic flexibility, potentially extracting value while maintaining tournament viability.\n\nThe potential scenarios range from dominating weaker pairs to facing a challenging matchup against premium hands. My tactical approach needs to maximize potential winnings while minimizing risk.\n\nA calculated 5-bet around 55-60 chips seems optimal - substantial enough to signal serious intent, yet preserving enough stack depth for post-flop maneuvering. This sizing puts significant pressure on my opponent while keeping my tournament life intact.\n\nThe key is extracting maximum value from my premium hand without overcommitting. By raising to 58, I force a critical decision: they'll need to commit 30 chips to continue, with a pot that will swell to 87 chips pre-flop. This strategic sizing creates a compelling scenario where they must either fold or risk a substantial portion of their stack.\n\nMy position and stack depth provide flexibility. I'm setting up a scenario where I can potentially dominate the hand's trajectory, regardless of whether they call or fold. The calculated raise balances aggression with prudent risk management.",

          "reasoning_content": "  MiniMax-M2's recent actions show some aggression but also frequent folding. They raised to 4 (a min-raise), then folded to my 3-bet of 16, but now they're 4-betting to 28. This is interesting - they seem to be playing back at my 3-bet.\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n- Hand 4: They raised preflop 20, then bet on flop and turn (showing aggression)\n- Hands 5: Called and bet small amounts\n- Hands 6, 7, 8: Folded preflop\n\nSo MiniMax-M2 is selective but capable of aggression. Their 4-bet to 28 from 16 suggests strength, but could also be a move to test my 3-bet.\n\nWith pocket Kings (KK), this is a premium hand. The only hand that beats me preflop is AA. Given:\n1. My hand strength: KK is the 2nd best starting hand\n2. Position: I'm in BB, which is disadvantageous post-flop but fine pre-flop\n3. Stack size: 178 chips (89 BB) - healthy stack\n4. Opponent's raise: 4-bet to 28 suggests strength but could be AK, QQ, JJ testing me\n5. Pot size: Already 45 chips, calling 12 to win 45 = 3.75:1 pot odds\n\nI should re-raise (5-bet) to apply pressure. Since minimum raise is 40, I need to go to at least 40 total. I should make it around 58-60 total to give them a tough decision.\n\nA 5-bet to 58 would be:\n- 30 more for them to call (28 to 58)\n- Pot would be 103 if they call\n- This puts pressure on them while still leaving me with 120 chips if I have to fold later\n\nKK is too strong to just call here.

I have Kc Ks, which means I flopped a set of Kings! The board shows one King (Kh), so I have trips, not a full set. Wait, let me re-read: Kc Ks means I have two Kings in my hand. The board shows Js Kh 4d, which includes one King (Kh). So I have three Kings total: Kc Ks in my hand plus Kh on the board. That's a set (three of a kind).\n\n**My hand:** Set of Kings (trip Kings)\n**Board:** Js Kh 4d\n\nThis is an extremely strong hand. I have trips with the best possible trips. The board is relatively dry - no obvious straight draws or flush draws. The only potential draws are:\n- Someone could have a gutshot straight draw if they have Qx (Qx would make a straight possible if a Ten comes, but it's not very likely)\n- Someone could have a backdoor flush draw if they have suited connectors in clubs or spades, but the board shows only one club (Js) and one spade (4d actually - wait, 4d is diamonds, not spades). Let me check the suits: Js is spades, Kh is hearts, 4d is diamonds. So there are two spades on board (Js and... wait, Js is spades, but I only have one spade on board. Actually, Js is spades, Kh is hearts, 4d is diamonds. So only one spade on board. So backdoor flush draws are minimal.\n\nThe preflop action suggests MiniMax-M2 has a very strong hand. They 4-bet to 28 after I 3-bet to 16, then called my 5-bet to 58. This indicates they likely have:\n- Pocket Aces (AA)\n- Pocket Queens (QQ)\n- Pocket Jacks (JJ)\n- Ace-King (AK)\n- Possibly a bluff with suited connectors, but less likely given the 4-bet sizing\n\nGiven the board texture and the preflop action, my opponent likely has:\n- If they have JJ: They flopped a set of Jacks (lower set than mine)\n- If they have QQ: They have an overpair\n- If they have AA: They have an overpair (but I beat them now)\n- If they have AK: They have top pair top kicker\n- If they have something like AJ: They have top pair\n\nThe pot is 117 chips. I have 136 chips left. If I check, I risk giving a free card. If I bet, I can extract value from all the strong hands my opponent likely has.\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall_opponent_actions:**\nI have data on MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) from previous hands. Let me review their patterns:\n\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 1: Preflop fold\n- Hand 2: Preflop check, flop fold\n- Hand 3: Preflop fold\n- Hand 4: Preflop raise 4, raise 20, flop bet 18, turn bet 18\n- Hand "

          "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket Kings and flopped a set on a board of Js Kh 4d. I have 136 chips left and the pot is 117. The opponent is MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4, who showed significant preflop aggression (4-betting to 28 and calling my 5-bet to 58), indicating a very strong hand like AA, QQ, JJ, or AK.\n\nWith a set of Kings on a relatively dry board, I want to extract maximum value. Since it's my turn to act and I can check, I need to decide between checking (to potentially induce a bet or trap) or betting for value.\n\nGiven the opponent's preflop aggression and my strong hand, I should bet for value. The minimum raise is 30, but I need to consider what sizing would be appropriate. Since the pot is 117, a standard value bet would be around 40-60 chips (1/3 to 1/2 pot). \n\nHowever, I notice the minimum raise is 30, which is quite small relative to the pot (117). I could raise to 30, but that might be too small to extract maximum value. Let me consider a larger raise.\n\nLooking at my stack of 136 and pot of 117, I could make a substantial bet. A pot-sized bet would be 117, but that might scare away worse hands. \n\nGiven the opponent's strong preflop action, they likely have an overpair or top pair. I want to extract value while also protecting against potential straight or flush draws (though the board is quite dry).\n\nI'll make a value bet that's substantial but not pot-sized. Given the pot is 117 and I have 136 left, a raise to around 50-60 seems appropriate - it's less than half pot, which might encourage calls from hands like QQ, JJ, or AK.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the minimum raise of 30, this seems to be the system minimum. I can raise to any amount 30 or higher. I'll make a solid value bet of 50, which is about 43% of pot - a good size for extracting value from strong hands while not being so large that I only get called by better hands (though there are very few better hands than my set of Kings).\n\nWait, I should reconsider. With a set of Kings on this board, I'm ahead of almost everything except exactly JJ (which would be a set of Jacks). Since my opponent 4-bet preflop, JJ is definitely in their range. But they could also have AA, QQ, AK, etc.\n\nGiven that I have 136 chips left and pot is 117, I could also consider going all-in to maximize pressure and value. But that might be too aggressive and could fold out hands like QQ or AK that might call a smaller bet.\n\nLet me make a standard value bet. I'll raise to 50, which is a reasonable size that gives good odds for opponent to call with many hands I'm ahead of.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me recalculate the stack sizes and action more carefully:\n\nStarting stacks:\n- Me (Seat 1): 86 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): 85 chips\n\nPreflop action:\n- I post BB 2 chips \u2192 84 chips left\n- Seat 4 raises to 4\n- I raise to 16 \u2192 put in 14 more (16 total), 70 chips left\n- Seat 4 raises to 28\n- I raise to 58 \u2192 put in 42 more (58 total), 28 chips left\n- Seat 4 calls 30 \u2192 puts in 30 more (58 total), 55 chips left\n\nFlop action:\n- Pot is 267 chips (this seems high, let me verify)\n- I bet 50 \u2192 but I only have 28 chips left!\n\nWait, the numbers don't add up. Let me re-read the hand history...\n\nActually, looking at the hand history again, it says:\n- \"Your Stack: 86 chips (43.0 BB)\"\n- Blinds are 1/2, so 86 chips = 43 BB is correct\n\nPreflop:\n- I post BB 2 chips\n- Seat 4 raises to 4 (so +2 chips)\n- I raise to 16 (so +14 chips)\n- Seat 4 raises to 28 (so +24 chips)  \n- I raise to 58 (so +42 chips)\n- Seat 4 calls 30 (so +30 chips)\n\nIf I raised to 58 total, that means I put in 58 chips. Starting with 86, I'd have 28 left.\n\nBut then on the flop it says \"Seat 1 bet 50\" which I can't do with only 28 chips.\n\nI think the notation might be different. When it says \"raise 16\", it might mean \"raise by 16\" not \"raise to 16\". Let me reconsider:\n\nIf \"raise 16\" means raise by 16:\n- I post BB 2 \u2192 84 left\n- Seat 4 raises by 4 (to 6 total) \u2192 but that doesn't make sense with the earlier notation\n\n\n- I raise by 16 (to 22 total) \u2192 put in 20 more, 64 left\n- Seat 4 raises by 28 (to 50 total) \u2192 put in 28 more, 27 left\n- I raise by 58 (to 108 total) \u2192 put in 58 more, -31... no that doesn't work\n\nI'm seeing multiple inconsistencies in the chip calculations. The raise amounts don't align with my starting stack, and the pot size seems inflated. Something's not adding up in the hand history notation.\n\nIf \"raise 58\" means raise to 58:\n- I have 28 chips left after preflop\n- Flop: I bet 50 \u2192 This would be an illegal bet\n\nI can't make sense of these numbers. The hand history seems to have inconsistent chip tracking that's preventing me from accurately reconstructing the betting sequence.\n\nThe key issue appears to be ambiguous notation around raise amounts. The pot size of 267 suggests a specific betting progression, but the individual raise descriptions don't clearly indicate whether they're total bets or incremental raises. This ambiguity makes precise chip calculation impossible without additional context.\n\nMy current focus is determining the most logical action given the unclear betting structure. The hand's progression suggests significant pre-flop action, with multiple raises indicating strong hand ranges from both players.\n\nI'm leaning towards interpreting the raises as total amounts, which would mean I have 28 chips remaining. This interpretation makes the subsequent 50-chip flop bet problematic, potentially indicating an all-in scenario or a notation error in the hand history.\n\nThe critical decision point involves calling 50 chips in a 267-chip pot with a strong hand, which mathematically seems like a clear call due to favorable pot odds. The hand's complexity stems from the unclear betting notation and potential tracking inconsistencies.\n\nMy set of Kings provides a powerful hand, and the pot size relative to the call amount suggests an easy decision to continue, despite the confusing chip count details.",

Pot = 116\n\nFlop:\n- I bet 50\n- Seat 4 raises to 100\n- I call 50\n\nSo on flop: I put in 50 more (total 108), Seat 4 put in 50 more (total 108). Pot = 116 + 100 = 216\n\nWait, but it says pot is 317 now. Let me recalculate:\n- Preflop: 58 (me) + 58 (Seat 4) + 1 (SB) + 2 (BB) = 119\n- Flop: I bet 50, Seat 4 raised to 100, I called 50\n  - This means I added 50, Seat 4 added 100\n  - Pot = 119 + 150 = 269\n\nHmm, the pot shows 317. Let me think again. Maybe the numbers are cumulative totals, not additional amounts.\n\nLooking at the actions:\n- preflop: Seat 4 raise 4 (so 4 total)\n\n\n- preflop: Seat 1 raise 16 (so 16 total)\n- preflop: Seat 4 raise 28 (so 28 total)\n- preflop: Seat 1 raise 58 (so 58 total)\n- preflop: Seat 4 call 30 (this is ambiguous - call 30 more to match 58?)\n\nI'm tracking the escalating raises and trying to understand the exact chip movements. The preflop action shows multiple raises, with each player increasing their total contribution. The call from Seat 4 suggests they're matching a previous raise, but the exact amount is unclear. The pot size of 317 doesn't align with my current calculations, indicating I might be misinterpreting the betting sequence.\n\nThe key details are my set of Kings on the flop, the 2s on the turn, and my short stack of 36 chips. With no bet to call, checking seems like the most prudent move, preserving my remaining chips while holding a strong hand.\n\nI'll carefully review the hand history to confirm my chip count and understand the precise betting sequence that led to this point.\n\nThe preflop betting went through multiple raises: I initially raised to 16, then re-raised to 58 when my opponent raised to 28. My opponent called, bringing my total preflop investment to 58 chips.\n\nOn the flop, I bet 50 chips, and when my opponent raised to 100, I called by adding another 50 chips. This means I've now invested 108 chips total (58 preflop + 50 flop call).\n\nStarting with 94 chips and now having 36 left confirms my calculations: 94 - 58 - 50 = 36 chips remaining.\n\nWith a pot of 317 chips and 36 chips left, I'm in a crucial tournament situation. My stack represents just 10.7% of the pot, which strongly suggests I should commit my remaining chips, especially holding a powerful set of Kings.\n\nI'll analyze potential opponent hands that could beat me: a straight seems unlikely, but a flush draw is possible with two spades on the board. I need to carefully consider my next move, weighing the strength of my hand against potential draws and tournament implications.\n\nChecking now allows me to control the pot size and potentially induce a bluff.

This is a very strong hand. The only hands that beat me are:\n- JJ (full house Jacks full of Kings)\n- 44 (set of 4s)\n- 22 (set of 2s)\n\n**Opponent tendencies (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the recall, MiniMax-M2 has been aggressive in early hands (hands 4-5) but has folded a lot recently (hands 6-8). They:\n- Raised preflop in hand 4 and 8 (this hand)\n- Made multiple raises in hand 4\n- Bet flop and turn in hands 4-5\n- Folded preflop in hands 6-8\n\n**Current action:**\n- Preflop: We had a raising war - they raised to 4, I raised to 16, they raised to 28, I raised to 58, they called 30\n- Flop: I bet 50, they raised to 100, I called 50\n- Turn: I checked, they bet 50\n\n**Key observations:**\n1. I have a monster hand (set of Kings)\n2. The board is relatively dry - no obvious straight or flush draws\n3. My opponent has shown aggression throughout this hand\n4. I only have 36 chips left, so I can't call 50 - I can only fold or go all-in\n\nWait, let me check the amounts again:\n- Preflop: I raised to 58 total, they called 30 (so they put in 58 total)\n- Flop: I bet 50, they raised to 100 (so they bet 100 total on flop)\n- Turn: they bet 50\n\nBut I only have 36 chips left. So I cannot call 50. My only options are fold or go all-in (which would be for 36 chips).\n\nActually, looking at the action more carefully:\n- Preflop: I raised to 58 total, meaning I put in 58 chips\n- Flop: I bet 50, then called 50 (so I put in 100 total on flop)\n- So I've put in 58 + 100 = 158 chips so far this hand\n- Starting stack was 194 chips\n- So I should have 194 - 158 = 36 chips left\n\nBut the amount to call is 50, which is more than my stack of 36. So I cannot call - I can only fold or go all-in for my remaining 36 chips.\n\nThis is a clear all-in situation. I have a set of Kings on a relatively safe board. The opponent could have:\n- A weaker hand they're bluffing with\n- Two pair (Jacks and something)\n- A lower set (4s or 2s)\n- A draw (but unlikely given the board)\n\nEven if they have JJ for a full house, I still have equity. But given the action, it's more likely they have a strong but second-best hand.\n\nSince I can't call 50 with only 36 chips, and I have a monster hand, I should go all-in.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My Hand**: 9c 5s - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and poorly connected.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position in poker.\n\n**Stack**: 387 chips (193.5 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Pot**: 3 chips (SB+BB)\n\n**Opponent**: Only the BB (Seat 2) is active. Let me review their tendencies:\n\nFrom the opponent actions I just recalled:\n- Seat 2 has folded preflop 7 out of 10 times (hands 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9)\n- Called once (hand 2) then folded on the flop\n- Raised once (hand 7) to 6 chips\n\nThis opponent appears to be tight, folding most hands preflop. They only played 3 out of 10 hands.\n\n**Current situation**:\n- Amount to call: 1 chip\n- I could call 1 chip to see if the BB folds or plays passively\n- I could raise to try to steal the blinds\n- I could fold this weak hand\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 9c 5s is trash. Very low equity against any reasonable range.\n2. **Position**: Being on the Button is great, but hand strength still matters.\n3. **Opponent**: Tight player in BB who folds a lot.

Can make straights, flushes, and strong top pair hands.\n2. **Position**: On the button - huge advantage postflop\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: SB is very tight/passive, BB is capable of big bets but folds frequently\n4. **Stack sizes**: Very deep stacked, can afford to see flops with speculative hands\n5. **Tournament**: Early/mid stage, no pressure yet\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight for button with deep stack\n- **Call**: Reasonable, see a flop in position with a speculative hand\n- **Raise**: Could steal blinds from tight SB and BB who folds a lot. Standard raise to 6-8 chips would be good\n\nGiven the tightness of both opponents (SB folds 70%, BB has folded 7 of last 10 hands), a raise seems profitable here. I can likely take down the pot preflop, and if called, I have position and a playable hand.\n\nI'll raise to 8 chips (4x BB) to put pressure on the tight opponents.",

This represents about 60% of the pot, which is a standard sizing that applies pressure while keeping my risk low. The bet suggests I have a strong hand and forces my opponent to make a decision with their likely missed flop. If they call, I still have overcards and position to work with on later streets.",

Even with two overcards, I'm likely dominated or way behind. The gutshot to an 8 gives me 4 outs (about 16% equity on turn), but that's not enough given pot odds.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (184.5 BB)\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Preserve chips for better opportunities\n- Opponent is tight and showing strength - respect it\n\n**Decision: FOLD**\n\nI should fold here. I'm facing significant strength from a tight player, I missed the flop completely, and I don't have the right pot odds to chase my gutshot. This is a clear fold situation.",

I'd be calling 8 chips with poor equity (~30-35% vs typical raising ranges) and would be out of position post-flop. With 184.5 BB, I can wait for better spots.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Qc 5c (Queen of clubs, 5 of clubs) - This is a suited but weak hand. Q5s is not a strong starting hand, especially in early position. I'm in CO (Cutoff), which is late position, but this is still a marginal hand.\n\n**Stack**: 369 chips (184.5 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Position**: CO (Cutoff) - Good position, but there are players behind me (BTN and possibly blinds).\n\n**Action**: \n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 11 chips\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Let me check what I learned about GPT-OSS-120B from the recall. Looking at their actions:\n- They fold a lot preflop (hands 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 all folded)\n- They raised to 4 in hand 5 preflop\n- They called and folded on later streets in hand 5\n- They folded on turn in hand 4\n\nSo GPT-OSS-120B appears to be relatively tight, folding most hands preflop. The fact that they're raising now to 8 (which is 4x the BB) suggests they likely have a strong hand.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 to win 11 (already in pot) + 8 (their raise) = 19 chips. So 8/19 = ~42% pot odds needed.\n\n**Hand Equity**: Q5s against a typical raising range (like 88+, ATs+, KJs+, AJo+, KQo) has roughly 30-35% equity. This is worse than the pot odds I'm getting.\n\n**Position**: Even though I'm in CO, I still have players behind me who could 3-bet. And if I call, I'll be out of position against the raiser post-flop.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With a healthy stack of 184.5 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. \n\nThe hand's potential is severely limited. Suited connectors offer minimal upside with Q5s, and I'm likely dominated by stronger queen or higher card combinations. Facing a raise from a tight player in a multi-player scenario, the risk significantly outweighs any potential reward. Folding is the most prudent decision to protect my chip stack and wait for a more favorable opportunity.",

The small raise to 4 chips (2x the big blind) from a stack of 42 chips suggests this might be a standard opening, but could also be a weak hand trying to steal.\n\nMy hand: 5d 7c - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. Even in position this would be a fold, and I'm out of position in the BB.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 to win 7, so 3.5:1 pot odds. Even with these odds, 57o is just too weak.\n\nMy stack is healthy at 367 chips (183.5 BB), so no pressure to gamble.\n\nThe opponent has shown they can be aggressive post-flop (Hand #9), so even if I hit something like a pair of 5s or 7s, I could be easily dominated.\n\nDecision: Fold.

QTo offsuit is a marginal hand, especially from early position. But I'm on the BTN (Button), which is the best position.\n\n2. **Position**: BTN (Button) - This is excellent position. I'll act last on all postflop streets.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 366 chips (183 BB) - This is a healthy stack, deep.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - SB: Kimi-K2 with 178 chips (89 BB) - relatively short\n   - BB: Kimi-K2 with 178 chips?

The table shows:\n   - Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 366 chips (this is me)\n   - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n   \n   Hmm, there are two players named \"Kimi-K2\". One is me with \"Thinking\" appended, and one is just \"Kimi-K2\". Let me assume:\n   - Seat 1 (me): BTN, 366 chips\n   - Seat 2: SB, 178 chips\n   - Seat 3: BB, but it says DeepSeek-V3.2 folded... wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me re-read the setup more carefully:\n\n\"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\" - so I'm in seat 1, BTN\n\n\"Players at table:\n  Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 366 chips\n  Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n  Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 256 chips (folded)\n  Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 49 chips (folded)\n  Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 147 chips (folded)\"\n\nSo:\n- Seat 1: Me (BTN) - 366 chips\n- Seat 2: SB - Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n- Seat 3: BB - DeepSeek-V3.2 - 256 chips (but it says folded, which is confusing because the actions show Seat 3 folded preflop)\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 49 chips (folded)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 147 chips (folded)\n\nWait, the actions show:\n- preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 1\n- preflop: Seat 2 post_bb 2\n- preflop: Seat 3 fold\n- preflop: Seat 4 fold\n- preflop: Seat 5 fold\n\nThis is confusing. If I'm Seat 1 on the BTN, why did I post SB? In a 5-handed game, the positions would be:\n- Seat 1: UTG\n- Seat 2: MP\n- Seat 3: CO\n- Seat 4: BTN\n- Seat 5: SB\n- Seat 1: BB\n\nBut it says \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\". Let me re-read...\n\nOh wait, I see the issue. The game is showing the actions that have already happened:\n- Seat 1 (me) posted SB 1\n- Seat 2 posted BB 2\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 4 folded\n- Seat 5 folded\n\nSo now the action is back to me (Seat 1) to complete the blind or raise. In this case, since everyone folded to me on the BTN, I only need to call 1 more chip (to make it 2 total, matching the BB).\n\nSo the situation is:\n- I'm on the BTN (Seat 1)\n- SB: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) - 178 chips\n- BB: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - 256 chips (but folded)\n- Actually wait, the actions say Seat 3 folded, which would be the BB folding... but that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me think differently.

Looking at the players:\n     - Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 366 chips (this is me)\n     - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n     - Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 256 chips (folded)\n     - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 49 chips (folded)\n     - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 147 chips (folded)\n   \n   Wait, I need to re-read. The table shows:\n   - Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 366 chips (this is me)\n   - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n   \n   Hmm, there are two players named \"Kimi-K2\". One is me with \"Thinking\" appended, and one is just \"Kimi-K2\". Let me assume:\n   - Seat 1 (me): BTN, 366 chips\n   - Seat 2: SB, 178 chips\n   - Seat 3: BB, but it says DeepSeek-V3.2 folded... wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me re-read the setup more carefully:\n\n\"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\" - so I'm in seat 1, BTN\n\n\"Players at table:\n  Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 366 chips\n  Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n  Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 256 chips (folded)\n  Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 49 chips (folded)\n  Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 147 chips (folded)\"\n\nSo:\n- Seat 1: Me (BTN) - 366 chips\n- Seat 2: SB - Kimi-K2 - 178 chips\n- Seat 3: BB - DeepSeek-V3.2 - 256 chips (but it says folded, which is confusing because the actions show Seat 3 folded preflop)\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 49 chips (folded)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 147 chips (folded)\n\nWait, the actions show:\n- preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 1\n- preflop: Seat 2 post_bb 2\n- preflop: Seat 3 fold\n- preflop: Seat 4 fold\n- preflop: Seat 5 fold\n\nThis is confusing. If I'm Seat 1 on the BTN, why did I post SB? In a 5-handed game, the positions would be:\n- Seat 1: UTG\n- Seat 2: MP\n- Seat 3: CO\n- Seat 4: BTN\n- Seat 5: SB\n- Seat 1: BB\n\nBut it says \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\". Let me re-read...\n\nOh wait, I see the issue. The game is showing the actions that have already happened:\n- Seat 1 (me) posted SB 1\n- Seat 2 posted BB 2\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 4 folded\n- Seat 5 folded\n\nSo now the action is back to me (Seat 1) to complete the blind or raise. In this case, since everyone folded to me on the BTN, I only need to call 1 more chip (to make it 2 total, matching the BB).\n\nSo the situation is:\n- I'm on the BTN (Seat 1)\n- SB: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) - 178 chips\n- BB: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - 256 chips (but folded)\n- Actually wait, the actions say Seat 3 folded, which would be the BB folding... but that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me think differently.

Only raised once in hand #7. This suggests a very tight player who likely has a strong hand when they enter the pot.\n\n2. **Seat 3 (BB - DeepSeek-V3.2)**: This opponent has been more active. They've folded several times but also:\n   - Called a raise in hand #11\n   - Checked then raised on the flop in hand #11 (showing aggression)\n   - Raised preflop in hand #13 and bet the flop\n\n3. **My own play**: I've been very tight, playing only 2 out of 14 hands (14% win rate, but that's misleading since it's win rate not VPIP). Actually looking at my hands, I've folded most of the time and only played hands #11 and #10 where I raised with J9s on the button.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with QTo (offsuit)\n- Everyone folded to me\n- I need to call 1 chip to see the flop (pot is 3, I posted 1 as SB)\n- The SB (tight player) and BB (more aggressive player) are the only ones left\n\n**Analysis:**\n- QTo offsuit is a marginal hand, but I'm in the best position (BTN)\n- The SB is very tight (folds 90% of the time preflop), so if I raise, they might fold often\n- The BB is more aggressive and might defend their blind\n- Pot odds: I need to call 1 to win 3 (3:1 odds), which is good\n- With my deep stack (366 chips), I can afford to see a flop\n\n**Decision:** I should raise. Here's why:\n1. I'm in position on the BTN\n2. QTo is strong enough to raise against two players, especially when the SB is very tight\n3. I can likely take down the pot preflop or have position postflop\n4. A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 6 chips total (raising to 6)\n \nI'll make a strategic raise to 6 chips, leveraging my position and the tight nature of the small blind.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Position: UTG (Under The Gun - first to act)\n- Cards: Qs 9h (Queen of spades, 9 of hearts)\n- Stack: 369 chips (184.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- To call: 2 chips\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- Q9 offsuit is a marginal hand, especially from UTG\n- This is not a standard raising hand from early position\n- From UTG, I should have a very tight range (roughly top 10-15% of hands)\n\n**Position:**\n- UTG is the worst position postflop\n- I'll be out of position against everyone else\n- Need to play very tight from this position\n\n**Opponent Information:**\n- MiniMax-M2 in BB has only 47 chips (23.5 BB) - short stack\n- Short stacks in BB can be tricky as they may defend/jam wider\n- I need to be careful not to get into a dominated spot\n\n**My UTG History:**\nFrom the recalled hands, I've been playing very tight from UTG:\n- Hand 3: Folded J7o from UTG\n- Hand 8: Raised 88 from UTG and won\n- Hand 13: Folded J2s from UTG\n\nThis shows I have a tight UTG range, which is correct.\n\n**Decision:**\nQ9o is not strong enough to open from UTG. It's easily dominated by:\n- AQ, KQ, QJ, QT (all have me dominated)\n- Any pocket pair is ahead\n- Even hands like AJ, KJ are flipping/favored\n\nThe only reasonable action here is to fold. Calling would be a mistake because:\n1. The hand plays poorly postflop\n2. I'm out of position\n3. I could easily get squeezed by players behind\n4. If the short stack in BB shoves, I'd be in a tough spot\n\n\nI'll maintain a disciplined approach and preserve my tournament stack by folding this marginal hand.",

We should preserve our chips for better opportunities, especially with our healthy stack size.\n\nThe suited nature and connector aspect don't compensate for:\n1. Very low card values\n2. UTG position\n3. Risk of being dominated by higher cards\n4. Tournament setting where chip preservation matters\n\nI should fold this hand.",

It's not strong enough to raise for value but has some potential.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is excellent position. I act last on all post-flop streets.\n\n**Stack**: 367 chips (183.5 BB) - Healthy stack, plenty of room to play.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Small blind posted 1 chip\n- I posted big blind of 2 chips\n- Everyone folded to the small blind (GPT-OSS-120B)\n- SB just called for 1 chip to complete\n- Pot is 4 chips\n- It's back to me\n\n**Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B in SB\nFrom the recall data:\n- Very tight player - folded 7 out of 10 preflop actions\n- Only raised once (hand #12 for 8 chips)\n- Only called once (hand #13 for 4 chips)\n- When they called preflop in hand #13, they checked and folded on the flop\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is a very conservative player who likely has a strong hand when they enter pots. The fact they just called from SB (rather than raising) suggests they have a decent but not premium hand.\n\n**My decision**:\n- I have position\n- Pot odds: I can check and see a free flop with my marginal hand\n- Raising would be a steal attempt, but against a tight player who already showed interest, it's risky\n- 7\u2660 9\u2666 is not strong enough to raise for value\n- Checking is free and lets me see the flop with position\n\nI should check and see the flop for free. This is a clear check situation given my marginal hand strength, position advantage, and the fact that I can see the flop without investing more chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been very tight - folding preflop in most hands. They only played hands 12 and 13. In hand 12 they raised to 8, and in hand 13 they called 4 preflop, then checked and folded on the flop.\n\nNow on this flop of 5c 3h Th, I have 7s 9d. Let me analyze:\n\n**My hand:** 7s 9d - I have no pair, no draw. Just two overcards to the 5 and 3, but the 9 is below the T on board.\n\n**Board:** 5c 3h Th - Very dry board. Only possible draws are gutshots (like 4-6, 6-7, 7-8, 8-J, J-Q) or backdoor flush draws. The T is the highest card.\n\n**Opponent:** Very tight player who just bet 2 into a pot of 6 on the flop. This is a small bet (1/3 pot). Given their tight nature, this could be:\n- A strong hand like a T (top pair)\n- A medium pair like 55 or 33 (sets)\n- Possibly just a continuation bet with air since I checked preflop\n\n**My situation:** \n- I have 367 chips, very healthy stack\n- Pot is 8 (6+2)\n- Need to call 2 to see turn\n- Getting 4:1 pot odds (8:2)\n- I have 6 outs (three 7s and three 9s) = ~12% chance to hit on turn\n\n**Pot odds analysis:** Need ~20% equity to call profitably, but I only have ~12% to hit one of my cards. However, implied odds could exist if I hit and can get paid.\n\nBut given:\n1. Opponent is very tight - if they have a T or a set, they may not pay me off big when I hit\n2. Board is very dry - hard to get paid on such a dry board\n3. I have no draw - just two overcards that might not even be good if I hit\n4. I'm in position which is good, but still...\n\nI should fold. The tight opponent betting into me suggests they have something, and even if I'm ahead of their range, it's marginal at best. With my healthy stack, I don't need to take marginal spots like this.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The opponent is very tight but made a small bet. They could be making a small c-bet with air. And I do have position. With pot odds of 4:1 and two overcards, maybe calling isn't terrible.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. A tight player betting on this dry board is likely to have:\n- Top pair (Tx)\n- A set (55, 33)\n- Maybe middle pair\n- Occasionally air making a c-bet\n\nAgainst that range, my 7 and 9 outs might not even be clean. If they have AT, KT, QT, JT, then my 9 outs are no good. Only the 7s would help me.\n\nGiven the opponent's tightness and the fact that many of my outs might be tainted, I think folding is the correct play here. Preserve chips for better spots.\n\nActually, wait. The opponent is in SB and just called preflop. Their range could be wider than I think. They could have suited connectors, small pairs, etc. The small flop bet could be a probe bet.\n\nLet me think about pot odds again. I need to call 2 to win 8. That's 4:1. I have 6 outs (7s and 9s). That's about 12% equity on the turn. I need 20% to break even on immediate odds. But with implied odds...\n\nIf I hit a 7 or 9 and they have a T, I might win a decent pot. But this is a dry board, so it's hard to get paid big.\n\nI think the disciplined play is to fold. I have a big stack, no need to chase marginal hands against a tight opponent who is betting.\n\nNo, actually I'm going to call. Here's why:\n1. The bet is very small (1/3 pot)\n2. I have position\n3. Opponent is tight but could be making a small c-bet with air\n4. I have two overcards\n5. Pot odds aren't great but with implied odds and position, calling is okay\n\nActually, I'm going back to fold. The opponent is too tight, the board is too dry, and my hand is too weak. Let me preserve my chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 9c 5c - This is a weak, non-connected, low suited hand. Very marginal even in position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (Button) - Best position at the table.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 369 chips (92.2 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - Small blind posted 2\n   - Big blind posted 4\n   - Player in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8\n   - I need to call 8 to see the flop\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n   - Very tight player - folds most hands preflop\n   - Has only raised preflop once before (hand #12) to 8 chips\n   - Called 4 chips in hand #13 but folded on the flop\n   - Called 1 chip in hand #19 and bet 2 on flop\n   - Overall pattern: selective, plays few hands, seems to bet small amounts\n\n   So this raise to 8 from a normally tight player suggests they have a real hand.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is 14 before their raise\n   - They raise to 8 (which is a min-raise)\n   - Pot becomes 22\n   - I need to call 8\n   - Pot odds: 22:8 or 2.75:1\n   - Required equity: ~27%\n\n7. **Hand evaluation**: 9c 5c has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a wide range, this hand performs poorly. It's not connected, low cards, only the suited aspect gives it any playability.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. Calling with such a weak hand out of position (though I'm on the button) against a tight player's raise is -EV. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\n**Decision**: This is an easy fold. My hand is too weak, the opponent is tight and showing strength, and I don't have the right pot odds to chase with this speculative hand. Even with position, the hand has very limited potential.",

Strong in early position.\n\n**Position**: UTG (Under The Gun) - This is the worst position at the table since I'll act first on every street. I need to be more cautious.\n\n**Stack Size**: 369 chips (92.2 BB) - I have a very healthy stack, giving me flexibility.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (209 chips) - Short stack\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 (240 chips) - Medium stack\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (40 chips) - Very short stack (10 BB)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B (135 chips) - Short stack\n\n**Action**: I'm first to act after the blinds. I need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\n**Pot**: 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n\nLet me analyze the opponent tendencies from the recall:\n\n1. **DeepSeek-V3.2** (Seat 3): \n   - Hand 20: folded preflop\n   - Hand 21: folded to a raise\n   - Hand 22: called a raise from Kimi-K2, then check-folded to a river bet\n   - Seems tight and passive\n\n2. **MiniMax-M2** (Seat 4):\n   - Hand 20: folded preflop\n   - Hand 21: folded preflop\n   - Hand 22: folded preflop\n   - Very tight, plays few hands\n\n3. **GPT-OSS-120B** (Seat 5):\n   - Hand 20: folded BB\n   - Hand 21: raised to 8, then folded to a re-raise\n   - Hand 22: folded SB\n   - Seems to defend blinds sometimes but folds to pressure\n\n4. **Kimi-K2** (Seat 2):\n   - Hand 20: folded preflop\n   - Hand 21: re-raised to 24 after GPT-OSS raised to 8\n   - Hand 22: raised to 12, then checked flop/turn, bet river\n   - More aggressive, willing to raise and apply pressure\n\n**Analysis**:\n- I have pocket 8s from UTG. This is a decent hand but vulnerable in early position.\n- There are several short stacks at the table (Seats 4 and 5), which might make them more likely to shove with weaker hands.\n- The player in Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown aggression and could re-raise me.\n- From UTG, standard play would be to raise with pocket 8s to:\n  1. Build the pot with a strong hand\n  2. Isolate against fewer opponents\n  3. Take initiative\n\nHowever, I need to consider:\n- If I raise and get re-raised by the aggressive Seat 2, I'll be in a tough spot\n- The short stacks might shove, forcing me to fold or call off my chips\n- From UTG, I should play tighter\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight with pocket 8s and a big stack\n2. **Call (limp)**: Could be okay to see a cheap flop, but gives no information and lets many players in\n3. **Raise**: Standard play, but I need to size it appropriately\n\nGiven I have a big stack and pocket 8s are strong, I should raise. But I need to be prepared to fold to a re-raise from the aggressive Seat 2 or a shove from the short stacks.\n\nStandard raise size from UTG would be 3-4x BB = 12-16 chips.\n\nLet me go with a standard raise of 12 chips (3x BB). This:\n- Builds the pot with my strong hand\n- Gives me initiative\n- Doesn't commit too many chips if I face resistance\n- Is a standard sizing that doesn't give away information\n\nIf I face a re-raise, I can comfortably fold. If called, I'll have position disadvantage but can evaluate on the flop.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- Position: SB (worst position post-flop)\n- Cards: 3s 7c (very weak, offsuit, low cards, no connectivity)\n- Stack: 369 chips (92.2 BB) - deep stacked\n- Pot: 22 chips\n- To call: 6 chips\n\n**Action:**\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) raised to 8 chips\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) called 8 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis from MiniMax-M2:**\n- Very tight player - folded 13 out of 15 recent hands preflop\n- When they do raise, it seems to be with strong hands (based on hand #9 where they were very aggressive)\n- They just raised from early position (Seat 4 is MP)\n- Stack size: 38 chips (very short)\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 3s 7c is one of the worst starting hands in poker. No pair, no suitedness, no connectivity, low cards.\n\n2. **Position**: SB is terrible position - I'll be first to act on every street post-flop\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 6 to win 22 = 3.67:1 odds = ~21.4% equity needed\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: MiniMax-M2 is very tight/weak based on the data. When they raise, they likely have a strong hand. The call from GPT-OSS-120B also suggests some strength.\n\n5. **Implied Odds**: Very low with this hand. Even if I hit a miracle 3-7-7 or 3-3-3 board, it's hard to get paid off significantly.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: I have a healthy stack (92 BB). No need to take risks with garbage hands. Better spots will come.\n\n7. **Post-flop Playability**: This hand will miss the flop ~90% of the time, and when it hits, it's often second-best (e.g., hitting a 7 when someone has a bigger pair).\n \nThis is a clear fold. The hand offers minimal potential and significant risk, especially from a poor position against a tight player. The combination of weak cards, bad position, and opponent strength makes folding the only sensible choice.",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand #26 - PREFLOP**\n- My Position: BTN (Seat 1)\n- My Cards: 8s 5d (offsuit, low cards)\n- My Stack: 369 chips (92.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- Players: \n  - Seat 1: Me (Kimi-K2 Thinking)\n  - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 199 chips\n  - Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 236 chips\n  - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 64 chips (folded)\n  - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 125 chips (folded)\n- Actions: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, seats 4 and 5 folded\n- Amount to call: 4\n- Minimum raise to: 8\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nI've recalled opponent actions for seats 2 and 3.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) - SB:**\n- Hand 21: Preflop raise 24 (big raise)\n- Hand 22: Preflop raise 12, then flop check, turn check, river bet 16\n- Hand 23: Preflop fold\n- Hand 24: Preflop fold\n- Hand 25: Preflop call 4, flop check, flop fold\n\nThis player is somewhat aggressive but also folds frequently. They make big raises sometimes (24, 12) but also fold often. In Hand 25 they just called SB vs BB.\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - BB:**\n- Hand 20: Preflop fold\n- Hand 21: Preflop fold\n- Hand 22: Preflop call 10, then check flop, turn, river, then river fold\n- Hand 23: Preflop fold\n- Hand 24: Preflop fold\n- Hand 25: Preflop fold\n\nThis player is VERY tight. They fold almost always, only calling once when facing a raise. They seem to only play strong hands.\n\n**My Hand: 8s 5d**\nThis is a very weak hand. Offsuit, low cards, no straight potential really, no flush potential. This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN (button), which is the best position. This gives me advantage post-flop.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 4 to win 6 (pot) + 4 (my call) = 10. So 4:10 or 40% equity needed. Even against random hands, 85o has only about 35% equity against two random cards. And that's against random hands - these opponents are tight.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- SB (Seat 2) is somewhat aggressive but folds often. They might raise big.\n- BB (Seat 3) is extremely tight, folds almost always.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I have a healthy stack (92 BB). No need to take risks with weak hands.\n\n**Decision:** \nWith 8s 5d on the button facing a BB who folds almost always and an SB who is aggressive but folds often, I could consider raising to steal the blinds. However, my hand is extremely weak. If I raise and get called, I'll be in tough spots post-flop.\n\nThe pot is only 6 chips. The risk/reward isn't great. I have a good stack and don't need to gamble.\n\nI think the best play is to **fold**. This hand is just too weak to play even on the button. Yes, I have position, but the hand has no real potential. Even if both opponents are tight, I could raise as a steal, but with such a weak hand, if either calls, I'm in trouble.\n\nLet me check: If I raise to 8 (minimum), SB would need to call 6 more, BB would need to call 4 more. Given their tendencies, they might fold. But it's a risk with a hand that has no equity.\n\nBetter to preserve chips and wait for a better spot.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. I'm on the button with 8s 5d. Both opponents have shown tendencies to fold. The BB folds almost always. The SB is aggressive but also folds often. The pot is small (6 chips). \n\nCould I raise as a steal? If I raise to 8, I'm risking 8 to win 6. That's not great odds. But if they fold often, it could be profitable. However, my hand is SO weak that if I get called even once, I'm in trouble.\n\nGiven my healthy stack and the weak hand, I should fold and wait for a better opportunity. The"

In Hand 25 they just called SB vs BB.\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - BB:**\n- Hand 20: Preflop fold\n- Hand 21: Preflop fold\n- Hand 22: Preflop call 10, then check flop, turn, river, then river fold\n- Hand 23: Preflop fold\n- Hand 24: Preflop fold\n- Hand 25: Preflop fold\n\nThis player is VERY tight. They fold almost always, only calling once when facing a raise. They seem to only play strong hands.\n\n**My Hand: 8s 5d**\nThis is a very weak hand. Offsuit, low cards, no straight potential really, no flush potential. This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN (button), which is the best position. This gives me advantage post-flop.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 4 to win 6 (pot) + 4 (my call) = 10. So 4:10 or 40% equity needed. Even against random hands, 85o has only about 35% equity against two random cards. And that's against random hands - these opponents are tight.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- SB (Seat 2) is somewhat aggressive but folds often. They might raise big.\n- BB (Seat 3) is extremely tight, folds almost always.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I have a healthy stack (92 BB). No need to take risks with weak hands.\n\n**Decision:** \nWith 8s 5d on the button facing a BB who folds almost always and an SB who is aggressive but folds often, I could consider raising to steal the blinds. However, my hand is extremely weak. If I raise and get called, I'll be in tough spots post-flop.\n\nThe pot is only 6 chips. The risk/reward isn't great. I have a good stack and don't need to gamble.\n\nI think the best play is to **fold**. This hand is just too weak to play even on the button. Yes, I have position, but the hand has no real potential. Even if both opponents are tight, I could raise as a steal, but with such a weak hand, if either calls, I'm in trouble.\n\nLet me check: If I raise to 8 (minimum), SB would need to call 6 more, BB would need to call 4 more. Given their tendencies, they might fold. But it's a risk with a hand that has no equity.\n\nBetter to preserve chips and wait for a better spot.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. I'm on the button with 8s 5d. Both opponents have shown tendencies to fold. The BB folds almost always. The SB is aggressive but also folds often. The pot is small (6 chips). \n\nCould I raise as a steal? If I raise to 8, I'm risking 8 to win 6. That's not great odds. But if they fold often, it could be profitable. However, my hand is SO weak that if I get called even once, I'm in trouble.\n\nGiven my healthy stack and the weak hand, I should fold and wait for a better opportunity. The"

Has shown some postflop aggression when involved.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Very tight preflop - mostly folding, only called once in recent memory.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Very tight but has shown some aggression when playing - raised to 8 in hands 24 and 25. Has a very short stack (60 chips = 15 BB).\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 75 suited is a speculative hand. It's not strong enough to raise UTG, especially with multiple players behind. It has some potential if you hit a straight or flush.\n\n2. **Position**: Being UTG is the worst position - you have to act first on all streets and you don't know what the 4 players behind you will do.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 2 seems reasonably tight\n   - Seat 3 is very tight\n   - Seat 4 is very tight but short-stacked and has shown aggression\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (92 BB). From UTG with a marginal hand like 75s, I should be very selective. The risk of running into a strong hand from one of the 4 players behind me is high.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1), which isn't great for a speculative hand.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold from UTG with 75s. It's too weak to open-raise from early position, and calling would put me in difficult postflop situations out of position with a marginal hand. The opponents behind include some tight players and one short-stacked player who might shove. Best to wait for a better spot.",

I have 5 players left to act behind me, and I'll be out of position postflop against anyone who calls.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 369 chips (92.2 BB) - healthy stack\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB): 58 chips (14.5 BB) - short stack\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (BB): 121 chips (30.25 BB) - medium stack\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2: 240 chips (60 BB) - decent stack\n   - Kimi-K2: 205 chips (51.25 BB) - decent stack\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recent actions I can see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB) has been folding a lot preflop (folded hand 26, just checked hand 27)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (BB) has also been folding preflop\n   - The table seems relatively tight based on limited data\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I'm in a tournament setting where chip preservation is important\n   - Playing speculative hands from early position is generally -EV\n   - The blinds are small relative to stacks, so no pressure to steal\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. This is not enough to justify playing 98o from UTG.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. 98s might be a borderline hand in some situations, but 98o (offsuit) from UTG with 5 players behind is definitely a fold. The hand has poor equity against the ranges that will call/raise behind me, and I'll be out of position postflop. \n\nI should preserve my chips and wait for a better spot, especially from better position.",

When they limped in for 4 chips, they're likely trying to see a cheap flop with a decent hand, or they're desperate.\n\n**Current situation**:\n- Pot is 10 chips (2 from SB, 4 from my BB, 4 from MiniMax's call)\n- It's checked to me (amount to call is 0)\n- I can check or raise to 8 minimum\n\nWith 5s 9d, this is a terrible hand. Even though I'm getting a free flop, I should consider:\n1. The opponent is short-stacked and may be desperate\n2. I'm out of position\n3. My hand has very little equity against any reasonable range\n4. Even if I hit a 5 or 9, I'll often be dominated\n\nThe only argument for checking is that it's free and I have a healthy stack. But playing this hand out of position against a short stack with a weak hand is -EV.\n\nI should fold. There's no point in investing even 0 chips (opportunity cost) when I'm so unlikely to win and I'm out of position. I preserve my stack for better spots.",

I need an 8 to complete the straight (5-6-7-8-9).\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nMiniMax-M2 has only 28 chips left (7 BB), which is very short-stacked. Looking at their recent actions:\n- Hand 28: Called preflop 10, bet 8 on flop, called 8, then checked and folded on turn\n- Hand 25: Bet 4 on flop\n- Hand 27: Checked flop, then folded\n\nThis opponent seems to be playing somewhat aggressively post-flop when they have chips. They called a 10 chip preflop bet in hand 28, which is significant given their stack size.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- It's checked to me on the turn\n- I have an open-ended straight draw (8 outs)\n- MiniMax-M2 is very short-stacked with only 28 chips\n- Pot is 10 chips\n\n**Pot odds calculation:**\nIf I bet, I need to consider what happens if they shove (which they might with any decent hand given their stack size). If I check, I get a free card to see the river.\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have a decent draw (8 outs = ~16% chance to hit on river)\n2. My opponent is extremely short-stacked and may shove over any bet\n3. The pot is small (10 chips)\n4. I'm out of position\n\n\n5. Checking provides a risk-free opportunity to improve my hand\n\nI'll take the conservative approach and check, preserving my chip stack while maintaining the chance to complete my straight draw on the river.",

However, my hand is complete trash (9-high). \n\nSince there's nothing to call (amount to call is 0), I can check and see a free showdown. Given that:\n1. My hand has zero showdown value\n2. I have no information that MiniMax-M2 is bluffing\n3. My stack is healthy and I don't need to take risks\n4. MiniMax-M2 has shown aggression when they have hands\n5. I have no chance of winning unless MiniMax-M2 has absolutely nothing\n\nThe best play is to check. There's no value in bluffing here - if they have any pair or even just a high card, they'll call. And with their short stack of 28 chips, they might feel pot-committed to call a bet.\n\nChecking gives me a free chance to win if they somehow have even worse than 9-high, but betting would just be throwing chips away.",

Our stack: 365 chips (91.2 BB). Blinds: 2/4. Pot: 14 chips. Board: Qc 7d Td 6s 2s. So board is Qc 7d Td 6s 2s. That's a straight possible? Let's see: Qc 7d Td 6s 2s. There are four hearts? Actually suits: Qc (clubs), 7d (diamonds), Td (diamonds), 6s (spades), 2s (spades). So there are two diamonds (7d, Td). No flush possible. Straight possibilities: 7-8-9-T-J? No 8 or 9 on board. Straight with 5? 5-6-7-8-9? No 8. 5-6-7-8-9? No 8. 5-6-7-8-9? No 8. 5-6-7-8-9? No 8. So no straight. Two pair? Board has Q, 7, T, 6, 2. No pairs. So the board is rainbow with no straight possible. Our hand: 5s 9d. We have a 5 and a 9. The board includes a 5? No. 9? No. So we have no pair. Our best hand is high card (Queen). So we have a weak hand.\n\nThe action: Preflop: SB posted 2, BB posted 4. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 4. Others folded. We checked. Flop: We checked, seat 4 checked. Turn: We checked, seat 4 checked. River: We checked, seat 4 bet 4. So they bet 4 into a pot of 14? Actually pot after preflop: Let's compute. Preflop: SB 2, BB 4, Seat 4 call 4. So total preflop: 2+4+4 = 10. Flop: no bets. Turn: no bets. River: we check, they bet 4. So pot is 10 + 0 = 10? Actually after preflop, pot is 10. Then no action on flop and turn. So pot is 10. Then they bet 4, making pot 14 if we call. So amount to call is 4. So we have to call 4 to win 14 (pot includes their bet). So pot odds: 14:4 = 3.5:1. So we need to win at least 22.2% of the time to break even. But our hand is very weak. We have no pair. The opponent could be bluffing or have a weak pair. Let's consider opponent's range.\n\nOpponent: MiniMax-M2, seat 4, stack 24 chips (very short). They have 24 chips left. They bet 4 on the river. They have been passive (checking all previous streets). They could have a weak pair like 2x, 6x, 7x, Tx, Qx. They could have a straight draw? No draws. They could have a pair of 2's, 6's, 7's, T's, Q's. They could have a busted draw? No draws. They could be bluffing with nothing. But they have a short stack and might be trying to get value from a weak hand.\n\nWe have a high card Q. If they have a pair of any card (2,6,7,T,Q), we lose. If they have a pair of Q's, they have top pair. They could have Qx (like Q2, Q6, Q7, QT). They could have a pair of T's, 7's, 6's, 2's. They could have a pair of 2's (like 2x). They could have a pair of 6's (like 6x). They could have a pair of 7's (like 7x). They could have a pair of T's (like Tx). They could have a pair of Q's (like Qx). They could have a straight? No. They could have a flush? No.\n\nWe have no pair. So we beat only a bluff or a hand with no pair (like a lower high card). But they have been passive and then bet on river. Could be a value bet with a pair. Could be a bluff with a missed draw? No draws. Could be a bluff with nothing"

          "content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step.\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My position: BTN (Button)\n- My cards: 6h As (Ace of spades, 6 of hearts)\n- My stack: 363 chips (90.8 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 10 chips\n- Amount to call: 2 chips\n- Minimum raise to: 8 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Table situation:**\n- Seat 1 (me): Kimi-K2 Thinking - 363 chips\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (BB) - 201 chips\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 272 chips (folded)\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 34 chips (called 4)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 119 chips (folded)\n\nSo the action is:\n- I posted SB (2)\n- Seat 2 posted BB (4)\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 4\n- Seat 5 folded\n- Now it's back to me\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is currently 10 chips (2 from me, 4 from BB, 4 from MiniMax-M2)\n- I need to put in 2 more chips to call\n- So pot odds are 10:2 or 5:1\n\n**My hand: 6h As**\n- This is Ace-rag offsuit. The Ace is strong but the 6 is weak.\n- In position (I'm on the button) this is playable, especially with good pot odds.\n- However, it's still a marginal hand that can get me in trouble if I hit the Ace and face aggression.\n\n**Opponent analysis - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):**\nLet me recall their actions. The tool shows:\n- They tend to fold a lot preflop (folded in hands 20, 21, 22, 23, 26)\n- They've raised to 8 in hands 24, 25\n- They called in hand 28 (called 10), then bet 8 on flop, called 8, then folded on turn\n- They called in hand 29, then checked flop, turn, and bet 4 on river\n\nIn this hand, they just called 4 preflop. This suggests they don't have a premium hand (would likely raise stronger hands). They could have:\n- A pocket pair (low/medium)\n- Suited connectors\n- Broadway cards\n- Some random suited hand\n- Maybe a weak Ace\n\n**Position considerations:**\n- I'm on the button, which is the best position postflop.\n- If I call, I'll see the flop with position on both opponents (MiniMax-M2 and the BB).\n- This is a huge advantage.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- I have 363 chips (healthy stack)\n- MiniMax-M2 has 34 chips (short stack)\n- BB (Kimi-K2) has 201 chips\n\nThe short stack of MiniMax-M2 is important. If I call and they have a strong hand, they could be pot-committed. But with only 34 chips, they're not a huge threat to my stack.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- This appears to be a tournament setting (chip stacks, blinds increasing)\n- With 90+ BB, I have a comfortable stack\n- I can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position\n- However, I should be careful not to bleed chips with marginal holdings\n\n**Decision analysis:**\n\n1. **Fold**: Too tight. I'm getting 5:1 pot odds on a hand that's not great but has some potential, and I have position.\n\n2. **Call**: Reasonable. I close the action, get good pot odds, and have position postflop. If I hit an Ace, I need to be cautious about kicker problems. If I hit a 6, I could have two pair or trips. The main risk is getting dominated by a better Ace.\n\n3. **Raise**: Could be an option. A raise to 8 or 10 would:\n   - Isolate against the short stack\n   - Take initiative in the hand\n   - Possibly win the pot preflop if they fold\n   - But it risks more chips with a marginal hand\n   \nGiven the short stack of MiniMax-M2 (34 chips), if I raise to say 12-16, I could be putting them in a tough spot. But I don't have a strong read that they're weak here - they just called, which could mean anything.\n\n**My recommendation: CALL**\n\nReasoning:\n- Good pot odds (5:1)\n- Excellent position on the button\n- MiniMax-M2's call doesn't indicate great strength\n- I can control the pot size postflop\n- Low risk with potential reward\n-"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: 6h As (pair of sixes with ace kicker)\n- Board: 6s 7s Td (I have a pair of sixes)\n- Position: BTN (button)\n- Stack: 361 chips (90.2 BB)\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- Current action: It's checked to me\n\n**Opponents remaining:**\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (BB) - 201 chips, checked preflop and on flop\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 34 chips, called preflop\n\nLet me analyze the data on MiniMax-M2 from the search results:\n\n1. **Hand 20**: Folded preflop\n2. **Hand 21**: Folded preflop\n3. **Hand 22**: Folded preflop\n4. **Hand 23**: Folded preflop  \n5. **Hand 24**: Raised preflop from UTG to 8, everyone folded\n6. **Hand 25**: Raised preflop to 8, bet 4 on flop and took down pot\n7. **Hand 26**: Folded preflop\n8. **Hand 27**: Checked preflop, checked flop, folded to flop bet\n9. **Hand 28**: Called preflop raise, bet 8 on flop, called raise to 16, then folded on turn\n10. **Hand 29**: Called preflop, checked flop and turn, bet 4 on river and took down pot\n\n**MiniMax-M2 tendencies:**\n- Generally tight, folds most hands preflop\n- When they do play, they can be aggressive (see hands 24, 25, 28)\n- They bet on the river in hand 29 after checking twice\n- Stack is very short (34 chips = 8.5 BB)\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have middle pair (6s) with ace kicker\n- Board is 6s 7s Td - there are potential flush and straight draws\n- The 7 and T could connect with many hands\n\n\n- I need to carefully evaluate my position and potential threats\n\nI recognize the board texture is moderately dangerous with multiple potential draws. My pair of sixes might be vulnerable, but my position on the button gives me strategic advantage. The short stack of MiniMax-M2 and the checked action suggest an opportunity for a value bet, but I must be cautious of potential stronger hands or draws.\n\nThe pot is modest at 12 chips, and I have a significant chip lead with 361 chips. This allows me some flexibility in my betting strategy. I need to balance protecting my hand with not overcommitting to a potentially weaker position.\n\nThe potential straight draw from 8-9 and the spade flush possibility make this board tricky. While I have a pair, it's not a particularly strong one. A small value bet could help me gauge my opponents' hand strength without risking too many chips.\n\nI should consider betting small to extract information and potentially take down the pot if my opponents are weak. The checked action suggests they might not have strong hands, but the board's connectivity means I can't be too aggressive.\n\nMy stack size gives me room to maneuver, so I can afford a modest bet to test the waters. A bet of 4-6 chips would be proportional to the pot and allow me to control the hand's progression without overcommitting.\n\nI'm sensing an opportunity to apply pressure, especially against the short-stacked player. The board texture suggests potential draws, but my position allows me to dictate the action. With both opponents showing passivity, a strategic bet could capitalize on their uncertainty.\n\nThe key is balancing risk and reward - extracting value while protecting against potential draws. A calculated bet might force difficult decisions for my opponents, particularly the player with the shortest stack.\n\nI need to carefully consider the minimum raise threshold and how it impacts my potential betting strategy, ensuring I make a move that maximizes my positional advantage without unnecessarily inflating the pot.\n\nMy pair of sixes with an ace kicker gives me a decent but not dominant hand. I'll make a small, strategic bet to gather information and potentially control the pot's progression. A 4-chip bet represents a precise, calculated approach that allows me to test my opponents' reactions while maintaining flexibility in the hand.\n\nThis conservative betting approach lets me probe the strength of my opponents' hands without committing significant chips, keeping my options open for later streets.",

Let me check...\n\nWait, the data says Seat 4 has 0 chips (out) but they just raised to 34. That doesn't make sense. Let me re-read...\n\nActually, looking at the players list:\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (out)\n\nBut then the action shows:\n- flop: Seat 4 raise 34\n\nThis is contradictory. If they're out, they shouldn't be able to act. Let me assume there's an error in the status and Seat 4 actually has chips.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have middle pair (6s) with Ace kicker on a board of 6s 7s Td\n- Possible straight draws: 89, 89s\n- Possible flush draw: spades\n- I'm facing a raise and a re-raise on the flop\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):**\n- Preflop: Mix of raises and folds, seems to raise with decent hands\n- Flop history: Mostly folds and checks, one bet of 8 in hand 27\n- In this hand: Called preflop, checked, then raised to 16 on flop\n- This is an unusual action for them - they don't typically raise flops\n\n**Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2):**\n- Preflop: Mix of folds, raises (usually 8), and calls\n\n\n- Flop history: Active with various bets, raises, and calls\n- Known for aggressive play with multiple betting patterns\n- In this hand: Called preflop, then raised to 34 on flop\n- Shows significant strength with a substantial raise\n\n**Pot Odds and Decision:**\n- 30 chips to call into a 66-chip pot\n- Getting 2.2:1 pot odds\n- Requires 31% equity to justify calling\n- Likely facing strong hands like top pair, sets, or potential draws\n\n**My Hand Evaluation:**\n- Middle pair with Ace kicker provides some potential\n- Vulnerable to multiple stronger hands\n- Uncertain about opponents' true chip stacks and intentions\n- High risk of being dominated by stronger pairs or draws\n\n**Recommended Action:**\nFold due to unfavorable pot odds, likely opponent strength, and limited hand potential.\n\nMiniMax-M2's substantial 34-chip raise signals serious hand strength, suggesting they have me beat. With two opponents showing aggression, continuing would be throwing good money after bad. The potential flush draw and Ace kicker aren't enough to justify the risk. Folding now protects my 357-chip stack, avoiding a costly mistake against likely superior hands.",

It's not strong enough to raise for value, but on the button with a tight player in BB, it might be playable.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is a huge advantage - I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - BB (DeepSeek-V3.2) is very tight, folding most hands. If I call, they're likely to have a strong hand when they don't fold.\n   - SB (Kimi-K2) is aggressive and plays many hands.\n4. **Pot odds**: Need to call 4 to win 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. Not great for Ace-8.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. Calling with a marginal hand could get me in trouble, especially against a tight BB who will only continue with strong hands.\n\nThe tight BB player is key here. If I call and the BB has a strong hand (which is likely given their tightness), I'll be out of position against them postflop (though I'll act after the aggressive SB). \n\nAce-8 offsuit plays poorly postflop, especially when the BB is tight. I could raise to try to steal the blinds, but:\n- The SB is aggressive and might defend\n- The BB is tight but when they call/raise, they'll have me dominated\n\n\nI'll fold this marginal hand. The tight big blind's range makes Ace-8 offsuit too risky. Despite my button position, the potential to be dominated and the poor pot odds make folding the smartest move. I want to preserve my stack for better opportunities.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** Qc 2c - This is a very weak hand. Queen is decent but the 2 is terrible, and they're not suited (wait, they ARE suited - both clubs). So I have Q2 suited. Still a marginal hand at best.\n\n**Position:** BB - I'm out of position postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 353 chips (88.2 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Situation:** \n- Blinds are 2/4\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 8 from Seat 3 (MP position)\n- Everyone else folded\n- I need to call 4 to see the flop\n\n**Opponent info (DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nLooking at the recall data, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in hands 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32 (7 out of 10 hands)\n- Raised in hand 28 and was aggressive postflop (raised flop, bet turn)\n- No showdown data\n\nThis suggests DeepSeek-V3.2 is a tight player who only raises with strong hands. Their raise to 8 (2x BB) is a min-raise.\n\n**Pot odds:** \nPot is 14 chips, I need to call 4. So 14:4 or 3.5:1 odds.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nQ2 suited is a weak hand, but suited. However, even with suitedness, this is a fold in most situations because:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. Against a tight raiser who likely has a strong range\n3. Q2 has very poor equity against typical raising ranges\n4. Even if I hit a flush, I could be dominated by higher clubs\n\nThe pot odds are decent (3.5:1), but my hand equity is likely much worse than that against a tight raiser's range. \n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack and don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving chips is important.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. This is an easy fold despite the suitedness and decent pot odds. The hand is just too weak and I'm out of position against a tight player.",

This means when they raise, they likely have a strong hand.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips into a pot that will be 26 chips (16 + 8 + 2 from SB). That's about 30% pot odds, which would require me to win about 30% of the time. With 9s 6c, I definitely don't have that equity.\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: I have 351 chips (87.8 BB), which is a healthy stack.

          "reasoning_content": "  The search didn't return any results, which suggests this might be early in the tournament or we don't have much history on these opponents yet. Let me think about this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I have 2d 3d (2-3 suited) on the BTN\n- Pot is 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n- I need to call 4 chips to see the flop\n- My stack is 351 chips (87.8 BB)\n- Only SB and BB remain besides me\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n2-3 suited is a very weak hand. Even though it's suited, the cards are too low and too disconnected. \n- In a heads-up or 3-way pot from the button, we might consider playing some speculative hands\n- However, 2-3 suited has very poor equity against typical calling ranges\n- We're only getting 1.5:1 pot odds (need to call 4 to win 6)\n- Even if we hit a flush, we could easily be beaten by higher flushes\n- If we hit a straight (A-2-3-4-5), we have the low end\n\n**Position advantage:**\n- We have position on both remaining players (BTN)\n- This is valuable, but not enough to justify playing such a weak hand\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- We're deep enough (87.8 BB) to make speculative plays, but...\n- This hand has very poor playability post-flop\n- We'd be playing out of position post-flop despite being on the button (since we'd be first to act if we just call and SB checks)\n\n**Opponent considerations:**\n- No history available on these specific players\n- SB has 241 chips (60 BB) - relatively healthy stack\n- BB has 268 chips (67 BB) - also healthy\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is an easy fold. 2-3 suited is simply too weak to play even with position advantage. We should preserve our chips for better spots. The pot odds are not attractive enough, and the hand has very poor equity realization.",

This is enormous. Given their pattern of small raises, this is either:\n1. AA/KK trying to get value\n2. A complete bluff trying to steal\n3. QQ/AK trying to avoid tough decisions\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in BB, so I'll be out of position postflop if I call.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- This is hand #37, we're still relatively early\n- Preserving stack is important but so is accumulating chips\n- Folding QK to a huge raise might be too tight\n- Calling leaves me pot-committed\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Pot odds:** Getting about 1.17:1, which is not great\n2. **Implied odds:** If I hit a Q or K, I could win a big pot\n3. **Reverse implied odds:** If I hit and they have AA/KK, I could lose big\n4. **Opponent's pattern:** They've never raised this big before\n5. **Stack preservation:** Folding keeps me at 86.8 BB\n\n**Analysis of opponent's possible hands:**\n- **Premium hands (AA, KK, QQ, AK):** Would make sense for this raise size\n- **Bluffs:** Possible but risky for them\n- **Medium pairs (JJ, TT, 99):** Might raise big to avoid tough decisions\n- **AQ, AJ:** Might raise big but less likely\n\n**My options:**\n1. **Fold:** Safe, preserves stack, but might be too tight against an unknown\n2. **Call:** 107 chips to see flop, leaves me with 240, pot would be 232\n3. **Raise:** Minimum 212, which would commit me\n\n**Recommendation:**\nGiven the opponent's unusual massive raise from their pattern, and the fact that I'm out of position with QK offsuit, I think this is a fold. The raise size is too suspicious and commits too many chips preflop with a hand that could be dominated.\n\nHowever, QK is a strong hand and folding might be too tight. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, thinking more carefully:\n- The pot is already 125 chips\n- I need to call 107\n- If I call, pot will be 232 and I'll have 240 left\n- I'll be essentially pot-committed\n\nIf I call and hit a Q or K on the flop, I could win a big pot. If I miss, I can check-fold.\n\nBut the opponent's massive raise is very concerning. They've never done this before in 36+ hands.\n\n**Final decision:** I think this is a marginal spot but given the opponent's unprecedented raise size and my position, I"

Showdown hand was Tc 7d, which is a very weak hand.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- Q3 offsuit is a weak hand, even from the button\n- Only 2 cards to call to see the flop\n- I have position post-flop\n- My stack is healthy at 86 BB\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak, Q-high with weak kicker\n2. **Position**: Good (on the button)\n3. **Pot odds**: Getting 3:1 (call 2 to win 6), which is decent\n4. **Opponent tendency**: BB has been active but also folds to pressure\n5. **Stack preservation**: 86 BB is healthy, losing 2 chips won't hurt\n6. **Implied odds**: Low - even if I hit a Q, I'll likely be outkicked\n\nFrom the button with a weak hand, I have two reasonable options:\n- Fold: Safe, preserve chips, wait for better spot\n- Call: Cheap, in position, can steal post-flop if BB shows weakness\n\nGiven that:\n- It's only 2 chips (0.5 BB) to call\n- I'm in position\n- The BB has shown willingness to fold post-flop\n- My stack is healthy\n\nI think calling is reasonable to see a flop in position. However, Q3o is really weak. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, with Q3 offsuit, even hitting a Q is dangerous (I'll be outkicked by any other Q). The only good flops would be:\n- Two pair (very unlikely)\n- Trip 3s (unlikely)\n- Straight draws (very unlikely)\n\nMost of the time I'll miss completely or hit a weak pair. Given this, folding is probably better despite the good position and cheap price. I should wait for a better hand.\n\nLet me fold this one.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**1. Hand strength and potential:**\n- I have 8s 9d - this is a suited connector (though not suited with each other) in a rainbow format\n- It's a mediocre hand that can make straights and two pairs, but no flush potential\n- In late position (BTN), this hand plays better\n\n**2. Position and stack size:**\n- I'm on the BTN (best position) with 345 chips (86.2 BB) - healthy stack\n- Seat 2 (SB) has 245 chips and has been fairly active\n- Seat 3 (BB) has 268 chips and seems more selective\n\n**3. Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- **Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**: Has raised preflop 3 times in the last 10 hands (hands 31, 35, 36). Shows aggression but also folds frequently. In hand 35, they raised preflop but folded on the flop. They seem to be playing a fairly wide range.\n- **Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**: More selective - only raised preflop twice (hands 33, 37) and folded to a re-raise in hand 37. They seem tighter and more positionally aware.\n\n**4. Current situation:**\n- It's folded to me on the BTN\n- I need to call 4 chips to see the flop\n- The blinds are 2/4, so I'm getting 6:4 pot odds (1.5:1)\n- With 86 BB, I have room to play speculative hands in position\n\n**5. Decision:**\nWith 8s9d on the button, facing only the blinds, this is a clear raise situation. I want to:\n- Steal the blinds (both opponents seem capable of folding)\n- Build the pot when I have position\n- Take initiative in the hand\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies, both can fold to pressure. Seat 2 has shown willingness to fold postflop, and Seat 3 is more selective preflop. A standard raise of 3x the BB (12 chips) seems appropriate here to put pressure on the blinds and potentially take down the pot preflop.",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand #39 - PREFLOP**\n\n- My Position: BTN (Seat 1)\n- My Cards: 8s 9d (suited connector, but not suited - offsuit)\n- My Stack: 333 chips (83.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 54 chips\n\n**Players:**\n- Seat 1: Me (Kimi-K2 Thinking) - 333 chips\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 245 chips (folded)\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 232 chips\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (folded)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 127 chips (folded)\n\n**Actions this hand:**\n1. preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 2\n2. preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 4\n3. preflop: Seat 5 fold\n4. preflop: Seat 1 raise 12 (MY RAISE)\n5. preflop: Seat 2 fold\n6. preflop: Seat 3 raise 40 (RE-RAISE)\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Amount to call: 28 (I need to put in 28 more chips)\n- Minimum raise to: 68\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponent analysis (DeepSeek-V3.2 in Seat 3):**\nFrom the recall data, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been:\n- Folding a LOT preflop (hands 23, 24, 25, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 36, 38)\n- Occasionally raising (hand 28 raised to 12, then continued aggression on flop and turn)\n- Hand 33: raised to 8\n- Hand 35: called 8, then bet 8 on flop\n- Hand 37: raised to 10, then folded\n\nThis is a tight player who folds most of the time but occasionally raises. When they do raise, they sometimes follow up with aggression.\n\n**My hand: 8s 9d**\n- Offsuit suited connector\n- Decent speculative hand, especially on the button\n- Can flop straights, two pairs, etc.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 54 chips\n- I need to call 28 chips\n- Pot odds: 54:28 or about 1.93:1\n- This is roughly 34% equity needed\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- I have 333 chips (83 BB)\n- Opponent has 232 chips (58 BB)\n- We're both deep enough to play postflop\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is great. I'll act last postflop.\n2. **Hand strength**: 89o is a decent speculative hand, especially in position.\n3. **Opponent tendency**: This player is tight. Their re-raise from the BB after I raised from the BTN suggests strength.\n4. **Pot odds**: 28 to win 54 is decent but not amazing.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: We're deep enough that losing 28 chips won't hurt much, but winning this pot could be significant.\n\n**What does opponent's raise mean?**\n- From a tight player, a 3-bet from the BB against a BTN raise usually means:\n  - Strong premium hands: AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe JJ, TT, AQ\n  - Sometimes a bluff, but this player folds too much to bluff often\n- The raise size is 40, which is 10x the BB. That's substantial.\n\n**If I call:**\n- I'll see flop with 89o\n- Pot will be 82 chips (54 + 28)\n- I'll have position\n- But I'm likely behind opponent's range\n\n**If I fold:**\n- I lose 12 chips already invested\n- That's fine - it's a small loss\n\n**If I raise:**\n- Minimum raise is 68, which would be a 4-bet\n- This would be committing with 89o, which is too weak\n- I'd only do this as a pure bluff, and against a tight player, that's not advisable\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAgainst a tight player who 3-bets from the BB, my 89o is likely dominated. The pot odds aren't compelling enough to call with this speculative hand against a strong range. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nThe fact that this opponent folds so much preflop but is now 3-betting suggests they have a real hand. I don't want to invest 28 more chips with 89o.\n\nLet me make the fold decision."

I have to act first on every street, which puts me at a significant disadvantage.\n\n**Stack**: 333 chips (83.2 BB) - I have a healthy stack, not deep but not short either.\n\n**Pot**: 6 chips (blinds only)\n\n**Opponents**: Looking at the recall data:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 has been raising preflop, including a 40 chip raise in hand #39 and a 10 chip raise in hand #37\n- GPT-OSS-120B made a big 111 chip all-in raise in hand #37\n- Both seem capable of aggressive preflop action\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 83 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots from bad position. The suited connector has some playability, but from UTG it's too risky.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 6, which is 1.5:1 pot odds. This isn't particularly compelling for a marginal hand.\n\nThe 7h 8h suited is a speculative hand that plays better in late position or against multiple opponents. From UTG, I'm likely to face raises behind me, and I'll be out of position post-flop. The risk/reward isn't good enough to justify playing this hand from this position with my stack size.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand situation:\n- I'm on the Button with 8d 3h (very weak hand)\n- I have 333 chips (41.6 BB)\n- Blinds are 4/8, so I posted 4 as SB\n- Pot is 12 chips\n- Amount to call: 4 (completing my SB)\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nThis is a very weak hand (8-3 offsuit). From the Button position, I could theoretically call the small additional amount, but this hand has virtually no playability postflop. \n\nLet me analyze the opponent tendencies from the recall data:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 in BB) seems to be the most active player\n  - Hand 36: bet 18 on flop\n  - Hand 37: folded preflop\n  - Hand 39: folded preflop  \n  - Hand 40: raised to 12 preflop, then bet 20 on flop\n  - Hand 41: folded preflop\n  - Seems like a reasonably aggressive player\n  \n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): \n  - Hand 37: raised to 10 preflop then folded\n  - Hand 39: raised to 40 preflop\n  - Hand 40: folded to a raise\n  - Seems to make occasional preflop raises\n  \n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B):\n  - Hand 37: made a big all-in raise (111 chips)\n  - Hand 40: called 8 preflop, then folded to flop bet\n  - Seems capable of making big moves\n\nGiven my very weak hand (8-3 offsuit), even though I'm getting decent odds to call 4 chips into a 12 chip pot (3:1 odds), this hand will be very difficult to play postflop. \n\nThe key considerations:\n1. Hand strength: 8-3 offsuit is in the bottom 10% of starting hands\n\n\n2. Position advantage is minimal with such a weak hand\n3. No realistic chance of improving meaningfully\n4. Better to preserve stack for stronger opportunities\n\nI'll fold this hand. The potential 3:1 pot odds don't compensate for the extremely low probability of winning. Saving 4 chips now allows me to wait for a more favorable situation where I can make a more strategic play. The risk of getting trapped in a difficult postflop scenario far outweighs the small potential gain from calling with such a marginal hand.",

Amount to call is 8 (the big blind)\n\nOpponent observations from the last 20 actions:\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, BB this hand): Has been fairly active. They made a big raise of 111 chips in hand 37, called 8 in hand 40, but has folded several times too. They seem to defend their BB sometimes but also fold frequently.\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB this hand): Has folded many times preflop, but did raise to 40 in hand 39. Generally seems tight.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has folded most hands, raised to 12 in hand 40.\n\nMy hand A9o from UTG is a marginal hand. It's not strong enough to raise from early position in a full ring game. With an Ace I'm somewhat dominated by better aces (AK, AQ, AJ, AT). \n\nFrom UTG, I should have a very tight range. A9o is typically a fold from this position. \n\nIf I call, I'd be investing 8 chips (1 BB) with a hand that will often be dominated and is out of position against everyone else.\n\nThe pot odds are 12:8 or 1.5:1, which isn't great for a marginal hand.\n\nGiven:\n- My position (UTG is worst position)\n- Hand strength (A9o is weak, easily dominated)\n- Stack size (healthy, no need to take marginal spots)\n- Tournament considerations (preserve chips for better spots)\n\nI should fold this hand.",

Raising could also be considered as a semi-bluff, but given the opponent's tight nature and the King on board (they could easily have a King), calling is safer. I want to see the turn and potentially get more value if I hit.\n\nLet me call 8 chips.",

This suggests weakness.\n\n**Pot odds**: \n- Pot is 48\n- If I bet, I need to consider what size\n- With a flush draw and gutshot, I have about 12 outs out of 46 unknown cards = ~26% chance to hit on river\n- Need better than 3:1 pot odds to call, but since I'm betting, I need to think about fold equity\n\n**Opponent's stack**: They have 79 chips left, and the pot is 48. They bet 8 on flop, leaving them with 79 chips.\n\n**Decision**: I should bet here. My opponent showed weakness by checking the turn. I have a strong draw (flush + gutshot). I can either:\n1. Check and take a free card\n2. Bet to apply pressure and potentially take down the pot now\n\nGiven that my opponent is tight and tends to fold when facing aggression, and they've shown weakness by checking, I think betting is better than checking. A good size would be around 1/2 to 2/3 pot.\n\nLet me bet about 24-32 chips (1/2 to 2/3 pot). This applies pressure and gives me fold equity.\n\nI'll go with 30 chips as a solid semi-bluff.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: 7c 5h - This is a pretty weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. Not a good starting hand.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Best position, but with a weak hand like this, position isn't enough to justify playing.\n\n**Stack**: 353 chips (44.1 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Pot**: 12 chips (SB + BB)\n\n**Action**: I posted SB (4 chips), Seat 2 posted BB (8 chips), everyone else folded. Now it's my turn to act.\n\n**Amount to call**: 4 more chips (to match the BB of 8 total)\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: Looking at Seat 2's history:\n- They tend to fold preflop often (folded in hands 37, 39, 41, 43, 44, 45)\n- When they do raise preflop (hands 36, 40), they follow up with bets on the flop\n- They seem relatively tight/passive based on this small sample\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. My hand is very weak (7-5 offsuit)\n2. I only need to call 4 more chips into a pot of 12 (getting 3:1 odds)\n3. However, even with these odds, 7-5 offsuit is rarely going to be ahead\n4. I'm in position (on the button), which is good, but this hand doesn't have good playability\n5. I could consider raising as a steal attempt since opponent folds a lot, but:\n   - Minimum raise is to 16 (12 more chips)\n   - This is 1.5 BB, which is significant\n   - While opponent folds a lot, I don't have enough data to be confident about a steal\n   - If called, I'll be out of position postflop with a terrible hand\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold with 7-5 offsuit. The hand has poor equity, and while the call is cheap, it's not worth investing even 4 chips with this hand. Save chips for better spots.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the pot odds. I need to call 4 to win 12, which is 3:1. But even with these odds, 7-5 offsuit is just too weak. \n\nActually, let me think about the button position more carefully. On the button with only the BB left to act, I could theoretically raise as a steal. But:\n- The raise would need to be to 16 (12 more chips)\n- That's 1.5 BB risk\n- Opponent does fold a lot (6 out of 8 preflop actions were folds)\n- But 2 out of 8 were raises, showing they can be aggressive with good hands\n\nGiven my hand is so weak (7-5 offsuit), even as a steal attempt this is marginal. If I'm going to steal on the button, I should do it with hands that at least have some equity when called (like suited connectors, Ax, broadways, etc.).\n\n7-5 offsuit has terrible equity when called. If I raise to 16 and get called, I'm putting in 12 chips with a hand that will miss the flop most of the time and I'll have to give up.\n\nThe fold is the clear, correct play here. It's not worth risking chips with such a weak hand, even with good position and some fold equity.",

It's not a premium hand, but being suited gives it some potential. From the button position, this is a decent hand to play, especially against the blinds.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the opponent actions I recalled:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has folded preflop multiple times (hands 41, 43, 44, 45, 46). Seems tight.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Has folded preflop frequently but did call once in hand 44. Also folded hands 41, 42, 43, 45, 46. Seems tight as well.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has folded a lot but did raise to 16 in hand 45 and bet on flop. Seems capable of aggression but mostly folds.\n\n**Position & Stack:**\n- I'm on the button, which is the best position post-flop\n- I have a healthy stack of 44.1 BB\n- Both blinds seem tight based on their folding patterns\n\n**Decision:**\nWith J7s on the button against two tight opponents in the blinds, this is a clear call. The hand has decent playability post-flop, and I have position. I could consider a raise, but with 44 BB, I don't need to be too aggressive with marginal hands. \n\nThe pot is 12, I need to call 8, so I'm getting 1.5:1 immediate pot odds. With implied odds and position, this is profitable.\n\nI should NOT raise here because:\n1. J7s is not strong enough to raise for value\n2. If I raise and get re-raised, I'd have to fold\n3. I want to see a cheap flop in position with a speculative hand\n\n\n4. The blinds' tight tendencies suggest I can capitalize on their cautious play without risking unnecessary chips\n\nA strategic call allows me to exploit their tightness while minimizing potential losses with a marginal hand. The combination of position, moderate stack, and opponent tendencies makes calling the optimal choice.",

They raised to 40 chips in hand 39, and in hand 44 they called preflop then bet 8 on the flop.\n\nNow they're checking the flop to me. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**My hand:** Jh 7h - I have a gutshot straight draw (need 9 to make J-T-9-8-7) and a backdoor flush draw. This is a weak draw.\n\n**Board:** Qd Th 8c - There's a possible straight with J-9, but I don't have that. The board is somewhat coordinated with straight possibilities.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the button, which is good position.\n\n**Stack sizes:** \n- Me: 345 chips (43.1 BB)\n- Opponent: 288 chips\n\n**Pot:** 20 chips\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** DeepSeek-V3.2 appears to be playing tight. They check-folded preflop many times, and when they did play (hand 44), they bet the flop. Now they're checking to me, which could mean:\n1. They missed the flop\n2. They have a marginal hand and want to see a free card\n3. They're trapping with a strong hand\n\nGiven their tight nature, checking likely indicates weakness more often than strength.\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check - see a free card with my weak draw\n2. Bet - try to take down the pot now with a semi-bluff\n\nWith my gutshot and backdoor flush draw, I have some equity but not a lot. However, given that my opponent is tight and has shown weakness by checking, a small bet could take down the pot immediately. If called, I still have some outs.\n\nThe pot is 20 chips. A bet of around 1/2 pot (10-12 chips) would be reasonable for a semi-bluff. The minimum raise is 8 chips, which is less than 1/2 pot but still a credible bet.\n\nI think a small semi-bluff is appropriate here given:\n- My opponent's tight/checking tendency suggests weakness\n- I have some equity with my gutshot\n- I'm in position\n- The pot is small enough that I can apply pressure without risking too much\n\nI'll bet 12 chips (slightly more than half pot) to put pressure on my opponent.",

The larger than usual raise (24 vs 12) suggests genuine strength\n2. However, I'm on the button with a decent hand\n3. The opponent folds to pressure often post-flop\n4. I have position advantage\n5. The call is cheap relative to my stack\n\nWith KJs on the button, I have good implied odds. The opponent's tendency to fold post-flop combined with my position makes this a profitable call. I could also consider a 3-bet to take control, but given their larger raise size, calling seems safer and more profitable given their post-flop tendencies.",

Anyone with any diamond has a flush. Also, someone could have a straight with Qx (Queen with any card), or even a straight flush with Qd.\n\n**Pot:** 52 chips\n**My Stack:** 341 chips\n**Opponent (Seat 2):** 227 chips\n\nThe action preflop:\n- Seat 2 raised to 24 (3x BB)\n- I called from the big blind\n\nLooking at the opponent's history:\n- Kimi-K2 has been relatively active with preflop raises (hands 31, 35, 36, 40)\n- They tend to bet on the flop when they raise preflop (hands 36, 40)\n- They sometimes fold on the flop after checking (hand 35)\n- In hand 48, they just called preflop and then folded\n\nGiven the preflop raise to 24, this suggests they have a decent hand. The board is extremely coordinated with 3 diamonds. Even though I have two pair, I'm very vulnerable to:\n1. Any diamond (flush)\n2. Qt (straight)\n3. AQ or QJ (straight)\n4. AA, KK, JJ (sets)\n\nWith the board being so wet and connected, and facing no bet on the flop (I can check), I should be cautious. This is a classic spot where checking is the right play because:\n1. I don't want to build a big pot with a vulnerable two pair\n2. If my opponent has a flush or straight, I want to keep the pot small\n3. If they have a weaker hand, they might bluff or value bet thinner\n4. I need to see the turn card to get more information\n\nChecking here is the standard play. I don't want to bet and get raised, as I'd be in a very tough spot. Let my opponent define their hand strength first.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My Hand:** Js Kh (Jack of spades, King of hearts)\n**Board:** Jd Kd Ad (Jack, King, Ace of diamonds)\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - good position\n**My Stack:** 341 chips (42.6 BB)\n**Opponent:** Kimi-K2 in Seat 2 with 187 chips\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Pot is 92 chips\n- I checked on the flop\n- Opponent bet 40 chips\n- I need to call 40 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have top two pair (Jacks and Kings), but the board is very scary:\n- There are 3 diamonds on board (Jd Kd Ad) - flush draw is complete\n- There are straight possibilities with Q-T making a straight\n- I have the King of hearts, so I don't have a diamond in my hand\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nLooking at the opponent actions, Kimi-K2 has been:\n- Raising preflop frequently (hands 31, 35, 36, 40)\n- Making continuation bets on the flop (hands 36, 40)\n- Folding to pressure sometimes (hand 35 folded after checking flop)\n\nThis opponent seems aggressive preflop and on flop, but can fold when facing resistance.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 92 chips\n- Bet: 40 chips\n- To call: 40 chips\n- Pot odds: 132:40 or 3.3:1\n- Equity needed: ~23%\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- I have top two pair, which is strong but vulnerable\n- Any diamond makes a flush\n- Q-T makes a straight\n- Any Ace gives someone trips\n- If opponent has AQ or any Ace, they have me beat (they have trips)\n\n**Decision:**\nWith top two pair on a very wet board (flush already there, straight possibilities), I'm in a tough spot. The opponent bet less than half pot (40 into 92), which could be:\n1. A value bet with a made flush or trips\n2. A semi-bluff with a strong draw\n3. A continuation bet with a weaker hand\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive tendencies and the fact that they raised preflop, they could have:\n- An Ace (trips)\n- Two diamonds (made flush)\n- A strong draw\n- A pair like QQ or TT\n\nSince I don't have any diamond in my hand and the flush is already there, I'm very vulnerable. However, I do have top two pair which is strong. \n\nThe pot odds are decent (3.3:1), but I'm not sure I'm ahead here. If I call, I'll have to face another bet on the turn or river.\n\nGiven my stack size (42.6 BB), I have room to play, but this is a tournament and preservation matters.\n\nI think the best play here is to **fold**. The board is too coordinated, I have no redraws to a flush, and many hands beat me. The opponent's aggression suggests they likely have something strong here.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I have top two pair on a board where I could be drawing dead to a flush. But the opponent only bet 40 into 92, which is less than half pot. This could be a value bet sizing with trips or a made flush, or it could be a smaller bet with a draw.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's pattern, they bet 18 into an unknown pot on hand 36, and 20 on hand 40. This 40 chip bet into 92 is proportionally larger than their previous bets.\n\nGiven that I have no diamond and the flush is already there, and there are straight possibilities, I think this is a fold. The risk is too high given tournament considerations.",

Let me look at their tendencies:\n   - They fold a lot preflop (hands 41, 43, 44, 45, 47)\n   - They called once (hand 48) but then folded on the flop\n   - They raised once (hand 49) and then bet on the flop\n   - They seem to be playing tight overall\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 12 chips, getting 3:1 odds.\n\n6. **Position advantage**: Being on the button means I can see how the flop plays out and act last.\n\nWith 8h Ts on the button facing a tight opponent who folds a lot, I have a few options:\n\n- **Fold**: This is safe but too tight. I have position and decent odds.\n- **Call**: This is reasonable. I'm getting 3:1 odds, have position, and the opponent is tight. If I hit a T or 8, I could have the best hand.\n- **Raise**: This would be a steal attempt. Given the opponent folds a lot preflop (5 out of 7 times shown), a raise could work. However, with my weak hand, I'd prefer to see a cheap flop.\n\nGiven my position, the opponent's tendency to fold, and the pot odds, I think calling is the best option. I want to see a cheap flop in position with a hand that has some potential (any T or 8 gives me top/middle pair).\n\nIf I hit something decent on the flop, I can take advantage of my position. If I miss, I can easily fold to any aggression.\n\nThe minimum raise to 16 is too much to risk with this marginal hand. Folding is too tight given the position and opponent tendencies.

Their range when checking to me could be weak or they could be trapping.\n\n**Pot odds**: Pot is 16, if I bet minimum (8), I'm getting 2:1 immediate odds if they fold. But I need to think about implied odds.\n\n**Position**: I have position which is good. I can check behind and see a free card, or I can bet as a semi-bluff.\n\n**Stack sizes**: I have 333 chips, opponent has 271 chips. Both are deep enough to play post-flop.\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. I have a decent draw (open-ended straight draw = 8 outs = ~32% chance to hit by river, ~16% by turn)\n2. I have position\n3. Pot is small (16 chips)\n4. Opponent tends to fold a lot but can bet when they have something\n5. Checking gives me a free card to potentially hit my straight\n6. Betting could win the pot now or build it for when I hit\n\n\n7. The board texture is relatively dry with potential straight and flush possibilities\n\nI'll carefully evaluate the semi-bluff opportunity. The board's characteristics suggest a strategic bet could be effective. With an open-ended straight draw and backdoor flush potential, a calculated semi-bluff might pressure my opponent while maintaining flexibility for future streets.\n\nThe semi-bluff offers multiple strategic advantages. By betting around 12-16 chips, I can potentially win the pot immediately, control the hand's trajectory, and set up favorable scenarios for my draw. The opponent's check provides an opening to apply pressure and potentially take down the pot without a showdown.",

Queen-high with a 3 kicker is not strong, but being suited gives some potential for flush draws. However, the 3 is very low.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is excellent position. I'll act last post-flop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 349 chips (43.6 BB) - Healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n4. **Pot**: 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8)\n\n5. **Opponents**:\n   - Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - Looking at their history, they fold a lot preflop (hands 43,44,45,47), but they did call once in hand 48 and then fold on flop, and raised in hand 49. They seem somewhat tight but can be aggressive.\n   - Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - Very tight! They folded in hands 45,46,48,49,50. Only played hand 44 (called preflop and bet flop) and hand 47 (checked and folded).\n\n6. **Action**: I need to call 8 to see flop.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: 12:8 or 1.5:1. Need 40% equity to break even.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: With 43.6 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I can afford to wait for better hands.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Q3s is a marginal hand at best\n- While I'm on the Button with good position, this hand doesn't play well post-flop\n- The BB (DeepSeek) is very tight, so stealing might work, but the SB (Kimi) is more active\n- With Q3s, I'm likely dominated if I hit a Queen, and flush draws will be weak (3-high flush)\n- The pot odds aren't great for this hand quality\n- I should preserve my stack for better opportunities\n\nDecision: FOLD. This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, even with position, and I have a healthy stack that doesn't require taking marginal spots.",

With 42 BB, I should preserve my chips for better opportunities rather than risk getting into difficult post-flop situations with a low, unconnected hand.\"\n}\n```",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** 4h 5d - This is a suited connector (4-5 offsuit). It's a speculative hand that can make straights and flushes.\n\n**Position:** Button - This is the best position post-flop as I'll act last.\n\n**Stack:** 337 chips (42.1 BB) - Healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n**Pot:** 12 chips (1.5 BB)\n\n**To call:** 8 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - 279 chips. From the recall, they fold quite a bit preflop (hands 47, 52, 53, 54), but they also raise sometimes (hands 49, 51). They seem to be a mixed player - not super tight, not super loose.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - 244 chips. This player is VERY tight preflop - they folded 7 out of 9 hands shown, with only one raise in hand 53. They seem to only play premium hands.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 4-5 offsuit is a speculative hand. It has potential to make straights (2-3-4-5-6, 3-4-5-6-7, 4-5-6-7-8) but no flush potential since it's offsuit. It's not a strong starting hand.\n\n2. **Position:** Being on the Button is excellent. I'll have position post-flop which gives me control.\n\n3. **Opponents:** The BB is very tight, so if I hit something strong, I might get paid. The SB is more active.\n\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 8 to win 12, so 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not great for a speculative hand like 4-5 offsuit.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With 42 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands. I should be selective.\n\n6. **Stack preservation:** Calling with a marginal hand out of position (well, I'm in position, but with a weak hand) could lead to difficult spots post-flop.\n\n**Decision:** With 4-5 offsuit, I'm getting 1.5:1 pot odds which isn't enough to justify playing this speculative hand. \n\nI'm on the button, but I need to consider the opponent tendencies. Seat 2 has shown some aggressive behavior with raises in hands 49 and 51, and they have a decent stack of 279 chips (34.9 BB). Seat 3 is extremely tight, folding 7 out of 9 hands.\n\nThe pot is currently 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8). I need to call 8 chips, which is 2.4% of my stack. While this seems small, playing 4-5 offsuit can lead to tricky post-flop situations.\n\nThe key issue is that 4-5 offsuit has limited potential. It can't make a flush, and straight possibilities are limited. Even if I hit a pair, it's likely to be a low pair with significant kicker problems.\n\nWith my position on the button, I might be tempted to call and see a flop, but the hand's limitations and the risk of getting into a difficult post-flop spot make folding the more prudent choice. I'll preserve my chips for a better opportunity.\n\nI'm folding this marginal hand to wait for a stronger position or more favorable cards.",

They raised to 20 in hand 53, folded to a re-raise, and have folded in other spots.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) posted BB and has 111 chips (shortish stack). They made a big re-raise in hand 53 (87 chips), showing they can be aggressive.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 42 BB, I should be focused on preserving my stack and waiting for better spots. KTo from UTG is a marginal hand at best.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 12 (1.5:1), which isn't particularly relevant since I'm folding anyway.\n\nFrom UTG, I should only play premium hands. KTo is definitely not strong enough to open from this position. The risk of running into stronger hands is too high, and if I get 3-bet, I'll be in a tough spot.

However, they called this time rather than raising, which might indicate a medium-strength hand.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- There's 20 chips in the pot\n- I can check for free (amount to call is 0)\n- Minimum raise would be to 16\n\n**Decision:**\nWith T5 offsuit on the button, this is a clear fold. Even though I have position and could see a free flop by checking, this hand has very little equity and will be difficult to play postflop. The opponent has shown they can be aggressive postflop, and I don't want to get involved with such a weak holding.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

The board shows 9d Jh As, so I don't have any pair, straight draw, or flush draw. I only have a gutshot straight draw (would need a Queen to make a straight, but with Th on board, that's not even a strong straight).\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is good position, but my hand is very weak.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the opponent data for Seat 2:\n   - They tend to fold preflop a lot (many folds in hands 41, 43, 44, 45, 47, 52, 53)\n   - When they do enter pots, they often raise (hands 40, 49, 51, 56)\n   - They've shown aggression postflop with bets (hands 40, 49, 55)\n   - They called preflop in this hand, which suggests some strength\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 41.1 BB, I have a decent stack. I should preserve chips when I have weak hands.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is small (20 chips), and I have no hand and no real draw. Even if I check and see a free card, I'd need a Queen to make a straight, but that would be a weak straight on a board with an Ace. Even if I hit a Ten, I'd have second pair which is not strong on this board.\n\n**Decision**: I have a very weak hand with no draw on a board that likely hits my opponent's calling range hard (Ace, Jack, and 9 are all cards that connect with many hands). Checking here to see a free card is fine, but I have almost no equity. I should not put any money into this pot.\n\nThe best action is to **check** and see what happens. If my opponent bets, I'll likely need to fold unless it's a very small bet (but even then, my hand is very weak).",

Let me look at their history:\n\nFrom the opponent actions I can see:\n- Hand 40: Preflop raise 12, flop bet 20\n- Hand 48: Preflop call 8, then fold\n- Hand 49: Preflop raise 24, flop bet 40\n- Hand 50: Preflop check, flop fold\n- Hand 51: Preflop raise 24\n- Hand 55: Preflop call 4, flop bet 16\n- Hand 56: Prefloat raise 24, then fold\n\nThis opponent seems to be fairly active preflop with raises, and bets flops when they raise preflop. They folded hand 56 after raising preflop, suggesting they can give up.\n\nIn this hand:\n- Preflop: They called 8 (just limped in)\n- Flop: They checked\n- Now on turn: It's my action\n\nThe fact they just called preflop and checked flop suggests weakness. They could have:\n- A weak ace that they're scared of the K on turn\n- A draw that missed\n- Middle pair\n- Complete air\n\nMy hand is very weak - just a gutshot. However, I have position and the opponent has shown weakness by checking twice. This is a good spot for a bluff.\n\nBut let me think about stack sizes:\n- I have 329 chips\n- Pot is 20\n- Opponent has 259 chips\n\nIf I bet, what size? Minimum raise is 8 (which would be 8 more, making it 28 total? No, wait - \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount. Minimum raise to 8 means I can bet 8 chips total.\n\nActually, looking at the prompt: \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this means the minimum total bet is 8 chips. Since the current bet is 0 (I can check), raising to 8 means betting 8 chips.\n\nA half-pot bet would be ~10 chips. A pot-sized bet would be 20 chips.\n\nGiven I have a gutshot and the opponent has shown weakness, I could:\n1. Check and take a free card\n2. Bet as a bluff\n\nChecking is safe but gives up on winning the pot now. With a gutshot, I have some equity.\n\nBetting could win me the pot now if opponent folds. Given they've checked twice, they likely have a weak hand.\n\nHowever, my hand is very weak. Only 4 outs. The opponent could have:\n- Any ace (they called preflop)\n- Any king (now they have top pair)\n- Two pair\n- A set\n\nThe K on turn is a scare card that could help my bluff, as it completes potential straights and could scare someone with an Ace.\n\nGiven the opponent's pattern of being aggressive when they have something (they bet flops when they raise preflop), and here they just called preflop and checked flop, they're likely weak.\n\nThis is a good spot for a small bluff bet. I'll bet about half pot - around 10-12 chips.\n\nWait, but the minimum raise is 8. I can bet anywhere from 8 up to my stack.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations:\n- I have 41 BB, which is a healthy stack\n- I don't need to take big risks\n- But picking up small pots is good\n- A small bluff here is low risk\n\nI think a small bet of around 10-12 chips is appropriate.

Let me look at their history:\n\nFrom the opponent actions I can see:\n- Hand 40: Preflop raise 12, flop bet 20\n- Hand 48: Preflop call 8, then fold\n- Hand 49: Preflop raise 24, flop bet 40\n- Hand 50: Preflop check, flop fold\n- Hand 51: Preflop raise 24\n- Hand 55: Preflop call 4, flop bet 16\n- Hand 56: Prefloat raise 24, then fold\n\nThis opponent seems to be fairly active preflop with raises, and bets flops when they raise preflop. They folded hand 56 after raising preflop, suggesting they can give up.\n\nIn this hand:\n- Preflop: They called 8 (just limped in)\n- Flop: They checked\n- Now on turn: It's my action\n\nThe fact they just called preflop and checked flop suggests weakness. They could have:\n- A weak ace that they're scared of the K on turn\n- A draw that missed\n- Middle pair\n- Complete air\n\nMy hand is very weak - just a gutshot. However, I have position and the opponent has shown weakness by checking twice. This is a good spot for a bluff.\n\nBut let me think about stack sizes:\n- I have 329 chips\n- Pot is 20\n- Opponent has 259 chips\n\nIf I bet, what size? Minimum raise is 8 (which would be 8 more, making it 28 total? No, wait - \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount. Minimum raise to 8 means I can bet 8 chips total.\n\nActually, looking at the prompt: \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this means the minimum total bet is 8 chips. Since the current bet is 0 (I can check), raising to 8 means betting 8 chips.\n\nA half-pot bet would be ~10 chips. A pot-sized bet would be 20 chips.\n\nGiven I have a gutshot and the opponent has shown weakness, I could:\n1. Check and take a free card\n2. Bet as a bluff\n\nChecking is safe but gives up on winning the pot now. With a gutshot, I have some equity.\n\nBetting could win me the pot now if opponent folds. Given they've checked twice, they likely have a weak hand.\n\nHowever, my hand is very weak. Only 4 outs. The opponent could have:\n- Any ace (they called preflop)\n- Any king (now they have top pair)\n- Two pair\n- A set\n\nThe K on turn is a scare card that could help my bluff, as it completes potential straights and could scare someone with an Ace.\n\nGiven the opponent's pattern of being aggressive when they have something (they bet flops when they raise preflop), and here they just called preflop and checked flop, they're likely weak.\n\nThis is a good spot for a small bluff bet. I'll bet about half pot - around 10-12 chips.\n\nWait, but the minimum raise is 8.

But I need to consider that if I get called, I have to give up on river (unless I hit my straight).\n\nGiven the minimum raise is 8, I could bet 8 chips total (which is 8 into a pot of 20, so 40% pot). That's a small bet.\n\nBut my hand is SO weak. I have no pair, no flush draw, just a gutshot.\n\nI think the conservative and correct play is to **CHECK**.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the opponent's patterns. From the recall, I can see:\n\n**Seat 2's patterns:**\n- Hand 40: Preflop raise 12, flop bet 20",

The board shows no pair, no flush, no straight that I can make. I have absolutely nothing.\n\n**Opponent**: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been the only other active player. Let me analyze their tendencies from the data:\n\nFrom the recall data:\n- They've been very active preflop with a mix of raises and folds\n- They bet on flops when they show aggression (hands 40, 49, 55)\n- In hand 40: raised preflop 12, bet flop 20\n- In hand 49: raised preflop 24, bet flop 40  \n- In hand 55: called preflop 4, bet flop 16\n- They sometimes check-fold (hand 50: check preflop, fold flop)\n\n**Current situation**:\n- The betting has been completely passive: check-check on every street (flop, turn, and now river)\n- Pot is only 20 chips (just the blinds)\n- I have nothing (Ten-high)\n- Opponent could also have nothing, or they could be trapping with a strong hand\n\n**Key observations**:\n1. The board is very coordinated: 9-J-A-K-6 with 4 different suits (no flush possible). This is a scary board with multiple high cards.\n2. Both players have shown zero aggression, suggesting both likely have weak hands\n3. My hand is absolutely worthless - I can't even beat a pair of 2s\n4. Opponent has shown they CAN be aggressive when they have something (based on past hands where they bet flops after raising preflop)\n5. The pot is tiny (20 chips), and I have 329 chips\n\n**Decision**: I should check here. There's no value in betting because:\n- Any hand that calls me beats me (even a pair of 2s)\n- I have no bluffing equity - what better hand would fold? The opponent has shown no weakness in their actions that would suggest they'd fold to a bluff\n- The pot is too small to risk chips on a pure bluff\n- Checking costs me nothing and might win if opponent also has nothing\n\nI cannot win by betting - only lose more chips.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the opponent's behavior:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been relatively passive\n- They fold often preflop (hands 52, 53, 56)\n- When they do play, they can call (hand 55, 57) and occasionally raise (hand 56)\n- In hand 55, they called preflop then bet 16 on the flop\n- In hand 57, they called preflop and then checked down to showdown with pocket 4s\n\nFrom the showdowns:\n- Hand 57: They had 4d 4s (pocket 4s) and called preflop, suggesting they'll call with small pocket pairs\n- Hand 30: They had Tc 7d (T7 offsuit) - this seems like they were in the BB and checked\n\nSo the opponent seems to be a relatively straightforward player who:\n- Folds weak hands preflop\n- Calls with medium strength hands like small pocket pairs\n- Can occasionally raise but also folds to pressure\n- Plays somewhat passively postflop\n\n**My Analysis:**\n\nWith pocket Jacks (Jc Js) in this spot:\n- I'm facing only the BB (everyone else folded)\n- I have a premium hand that dominates most of the opponent's range\n- The opponent has shown they'll call with hands like pocket 4s\n- My stack is healthy at 40.6 BB\n- The opponent's stack is 33.9 BB\n\n**Decision:** I should raise to build the pot and extract value from my premium hand. A standard raise would be 3x the BB (24 chips), but since I'm in the SB and it's 4 more to call, a raise to 24-32 chips would be appropriate.\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to call with medium hands and my position (assuming I'm SB/out of position), I should make a solid raise. Let me raise to 24 chips (3x BB) which is standard.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise: it's 16 chips. A 3x BB raise would be to 24 chips total. This seems appropriate.\n\nLet me reconsider the position confusion. The problem states \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 1)\" but then shows \"preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 4\". This is contradictory. However, the key information is:\n- I posted 4 chips (SB)\n\n\n- Seat 2 posted 8 chips (BB)\n- I need to call 4 more chips\n\nI'll carefully evaluate my position and potential actions. The conflicting position information requires a precise approach to maximize my advantage with pocket Jacks.\n\nCalculating the raise mechanics reveals nuanced possibilities. A 3x big blind raise to 24 chips represents a strategic move that balances aggression with pot control. This sizing pressures opponents while maintaining flexibility for future streets.\n\nThe hand's dynamics suggest a calculated raise that extracts value and potentially isolates weaker holdings. My pocket Jacks warrant a confident, well-sized preflop action.",

Ace is good, but kicker is terrible. Suited helps slightly.\n2. **Position**: Excellent. Acting last postflop is a huge advantage.\n3. **Opponents**: Both can be aggressive but also fold to pressure. DeepSeek has made big raises recently.\n4. **Stack sizes**: All stacks are deep enough (40+ BB) that we can play postflop poker.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: We're in decent chip position. Don't need to take unnecessary risks, but button is a good spot to accumulate.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight for button with A3s. We're giving up too much equity.\n- **Call**: \n  - Pros: See flop in position, good pot odds, can control pot size\n  - Cons: Could face aggression from either player, dominated by better aces\n- **Raise**:\n  - Pros: Take initiative, possibly win pot preflop, define hand strength, play in position\n  - Cons: Could get 3-bet by either player, especially DeepSeek who has been aggressive\n\nGiven I'm on the button with A3s, I think a raise is appropriate to try to take control. However, I need to be careful about sizing. If I raise and get 3-bet, I'll likely have to fold given the weak kicker.\n\nA standard button raise would be about 2.5-3x the BB, so around 20-24 chips. This would be 2.5-3x the BB.\n\nLet me consider the minimum raise is 16, which is only 2x BB. That's a bit small and might invite calls/raises. A raise to 24 (3x BB) seems more appropriate.\n\nActually, looking at the stacks, a raise to 20-24 seems good. Let me go with 24 to make it a proper 3x BB raise, which is standard from the button.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. With A3s, I don't want to bloat the pot too much preflop because my hand is easily dominated. The advantage of position means I can call and see a flop, then make decisions based on board texture.\n\nGiven the weak kicker, maybe calling is better. I have good pot odds (8 to win 12), I'm in position, and I can control the pot size postflop. If I hit an ace, I need to be cautious about kicker issues. If I hit a flush draw, I have good implied odds.\n\nI think calling is the most prudent play here. It keeps the pot small, allows me to use my positional advantage postflop, and doesn't risk getting 3-bet off my hand.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. The button is a stealing spot. With A3s, I have some equity if called. A raise to 24 (3x BB) gives both opponents a decision. If they fold, I win 12 chips uncontested. If they call, I'm in position. If they 3-bet, I can fold knowing I'm likely dominated.\n\nGiven that both opponents have shown they can fold, and I'm on the button, I think"

          "reasoning_content": "  This is a tricky situation. Let me analyze:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 3s Ah (ace with a weak kicker)\n- Board: Ts Td Qs \n- Position: Button\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- To call: 24 chips\n- My stack: 329 chips (41.1 BB)\n\n**Board texture:**\n- Paired board with Ts Td Qs\n- Two spades (potential flush draw)\n- I have the 3s which blocks some flush draws but not strongly\n\n**My hand:**\n- I have Ah - so I have an overcard to the board\n- Backdoor nut flush draw (need two more spades)\n- However, my kicker is terrible (3s)\n- On a paired board like this, my ace-high is not very strong\n\n**Opponent tendencies (Seat 3 - DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nI should check what I know about this opponent. Let me look at their actions.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 48, need to call 24\n- Getting 2:1 on my call\n- Need ~33% equity to call\n\n**Situation:**\n- Preflop: I called from button, SB called, BB checked\n- Flop: SB checks, BB bets 24 into 48 pot (half pot)\n- This could be: value bet with T or Q, semi-bluff with flush draw, or pure bluff\n\nGiven that I have position and an ace-high with backdoor flush draw, calling might be okay, but I'm not thrilled about it. Let me think about what hands beat me:\n- Any T (trip tens)\n- Any Q (top pair)\n- Any pocket pair 22-JJ (though some might not bet)\n- Flush draws\n\nWhat do I beat?\n- Pure bluffs\n- Some weaker hands like KJ, K9, etc.\n\nThe bet sizing of half pot suggests either a value bet or a standard c-bet. Given the paired board, I think folding is probably best here. My ace-high is just not strong enough on this board texture, and I don't have great implied odds.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. In position with an ace-high and backdoor flush draw, calling 24 to win 72 (48+24) might be okay. But I'm still not happy about it. The fact that the board is paired makes it more likely they have trips or a full house possibility.\n\nI think folding is the correct play here. My hand is too weak to continue, and I can find better spots with my 41 BB stack.\n\nWait, let me think about tournament considerations. With 41 BB, I have a decent stack and don't need to take marginal spots. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities. The call would put me in difficult turn/river spots without a clear plan.\n\nFinal decision: FOLD.",

This is not relevant with such a weak hand.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With Q4o from UTG, this is an easy fold. I don't need to take risks with such a weak hand, especially when I have a healthy stack.

GPT-OSS-120B is extremely short-stacked and making a large raise relative to blinds. They're likely shoving with a strong hand (any pocket pair, strong Ax, or broadway hands). J8s doesn't have enough equity against that range, and even with the good pot odds, it's not worth risking chips with a marginal hand when I'm also relatively short-stacked at 19.6 BB.",

While I have a suited hand, it's not strong enough to call a raise from the SB out of position. The opponent has shown aggression, and Js 9s doesn't play well against a typical raising range. The 55 chip call represents a significant portion of my stack (18%), and I'll be out of position postflop. This is a clear fold to preserve my tournament life.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand:** Ah 2h (Ace of hearts, 2 of hearts) - This is a suited A2 hand. It has some potential but is not a strong hand. It can make the nut flush, but if an Ace comes on the board, my kicker is terrible (2). \n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. This is a big advantage.\n\n**Stack size:** I have 305 chips (19.1 BB). This is a decent stack size, though not deep.\n\n**Blinds:** 8/16, so the pot is 24 (SB + BB)\n\n**Action:** \n- Seat 2 (SB) posted 8\n- Seat 3 (BB) posted 16\n- I need to call 16 to see the flop\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 in SB):**\n- Has shown some aggression preflop (raised to 24 in hand 60)\n- Has called preflop (hands 59, 62)\n- Has folded preflop (hands 58, 61)\n- Showdowns show they play some weaker hands (T7o, 44, K5o)\n- Seems to be a somewhat loose player\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB):**\n- Has been quite aggressive preflop (raised to 60 in hand 56)\n- Has folded preflop many times (hands 57, 58, 60, 61, 62)\n- Has check-called in hand 59\n- Seems to be a tighter player who occasionally makes big raises\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** A2s is a marginal hand. It has flush potential but terrible kicker problems if an Ace hits. It's a hand that plays well in position against weak opponents, but can get you in trouble.\n\n2. **Position:** Being on the Button is excellent. I get to act last on every street post-flop.\n\n3. **Stack size:** With 19.1 BB, I have enough chips to see a flop, but I shouldn't be committing too many chips with a marginal hand.\n\n4. **Opponents:** \n   - The BB (DeepSeek-V3.2) seems tighter and has shown aggression. They might defend their blind.\n   - The SB seems looser and could have a wide range.\n\n5. **Pot odds:** I need to call 16 to win 24, which is 1.5:1 odds. This is not great for a marginal hand like A2s.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** With 19.1 BB, I should be somewhat selective. A2s is at the bottom of my playable range, but position helps.\n\n**Decision:** I think calling is reasonable here given my position and the fact that both opponents seem beatable. The BB has shown they can fold to pressure, and being on the Button gives me maximum information post-flop. However, I need to be careful post-flop and ready to fold if I don't hit a strong hand.\n\nRaising could also be an option to try to steal the blinds, but with A2s I prefer to see a cheap flop rather than build a big pot with a marginal hand.\n\nI'll call and see the flop in position.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 19.1 BB and A2s, this is a borderline hand. The BB has shown aggression (raised to 60 in hand 56), so they might defend. Given my position and the fact that I only need to call 16 (5.2% of my stack), I think calling is fine to see a flop and try to hit a flush or get a good situation to steal.\n\nBut wait - let me think about this more carefully. With A2s, I'm really hoping to hit a flush. If I hit an Ace, I have kicker problems. If I hit a 2, it's usually not good enough. So I'm basically set-mining for a flush. \n\nWith the BB showing aggression and the SB being loose, I might be better off folding this marginal hand and waiting for a better spot. However, the power of position on the Button is significant.\n\nI think I'll go with a call. The price is reasonable (16 chips to see a flop from the best position), and I can easily fold if I miss or if the action gets too heavy post-flop.",

I have Ah 2h.\n\n2. **Board**: Ad 8c 7c\n   - I have top pair with a weak kicker (Ace with 2 kicker)\n   - There are two clubs on board, so a flush draw is possible\n   - The board is somewhat coordinated with 8-7, so straight draws are possible\n\n3. **Hand strength**: I have top pair, but with a terrible kicker. This is a marginal hand at best.\n\n4. **Opponent actions**: Both opponents checked. This could mean:\n   - They have nothing and are giving up\n   - They have marginal hands and want to see a free card\n   - They're trapping with a strong hand\n\n5. **My position**: I'm on the Button, which is good position. I acted last preflop and am acting last now.\n\n6. **Stack sizes**: I have 289 chips (18.1 BB), which is a decent stack. Not desperate yet.\n\n7. **Pot size**: 48 chips, which is 3 BB. It's a small pot.\n\n8. **My options**: I can check or raise (minimum raise to 16).\n\nLet me think about what to do:\n- If I check, I give a free card. With two clubs and connected cards, there are many turn cards that could hurt me (any club, any 9, any 6, any other Ace with a better kicker, etc.).\n- If I bet, I need to decide on a size. The minimum raise is 16 (which would be a bet of 16 since I'm facing 0 to call). That would be a small bet into a 48 pot (1/3 pot).\n\nWith top pair, even with a weak kicker, I should probably bet for value and protection. I want to:\n1. Get value from worse hands (like 8x, 7x, straight draws, flush draws)\n2. Charge draws to continue\n3. Find out where I stand\n\nA bet of 16 (1/3 pot) seems reasonable. It's not too big, but it charges draws and might get calls from worse hands.\n\nHowever, let me think about checking. If I check, I'm giving free cards. But with my weak kicker, maybe I want to control the pot size. But I think betting is better because:\n- I have top pair\n- The board is draw-heavy\n- I can get value from many worse hands\n- Both players showed weakness by checking\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. I have Ah 2h. The board is Ad 8c 7c.\n- I have top pair, weak kicker\n- There are many hands that could be ahead: A8, A7, 88, 77, AK, AQ, AJ, AT\n- There are many draws: any two clubs, 9-6, 9-T, T-6\n\nBut the key is: both opponents checked. They could have:\n- Nothing (missed the flop)\n- Draws (checking to see a free card)\n- Marginal hands (like my hand)\n\nWith position, I can check behind and see a free card. If the turn is safe, I can bet then. If the turn is dangerous, I can check behind or fold to action.\n\nBut I think betting is better. Let me bet about half pot. The pot is 48, so half pot would be 24. But the minimum raise is 16. Let me bet 24.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions, it says \"Minimum raise to: 16\". This means the minimum total amount I can put in is 16. So I can bet anywhere from 16 up to my stack.\n\nI think a bet of 24 (half pot) is good. It charges draws and gets value from worse hands.\n\nWait, but I should also consider my kicker. With A2, I'm vulnerable to any other Ace. If someone has Ax, I'm losing. But would they check Ax? Maybe with a weak kicker, but probably not. They'd likely bet for value/protection.\n\nGiven both checked, I think betting is correct. Let me bet 24.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. The board is Ad 8c 7c. This is a somewhat coordinated board. I have top pair, weak kicker. Both opponents checked.\n\nIn position with top pair, I should bet for value and protection. My hand is vulnerable but likely best right now. I want to charge draws and get value from worse pairs.\n\nI'll bet 24 (half pot).",

Only saw them bet once on flop after checking preflop. They complete SB here rather than raising.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 4d Ac is a weak Ace with terrible kicker\n- Offsuit, no connectivity\n- From BTN, I could raise to steal, but...\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n1. **Opponent is tight/passive** - They complete SB rather than raise, showing weakness\n2. **My hand is weak** - A4o is marginal, bad kicker\n3. **Position** - I have BTN advantage postflop\n4. **Stack sizes** - Both ~20 BB, healthy\n5. **Tournament** - Need to accumulate chips but avoid marginal spots\n\n**Decision Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight from BTN vs weak opponent\n- **Check**: See flop for free, but with weak hand\n- **Raise**: Steal attempt vs weak opponent\n\n**Optimal Play:** Check. Here's why:\n- My hand is too weak to raise for value\n- Opponent is tight but might defend SB\n- Raising to 32 would risk 2 BB with weak hand\n- I can see flop and evaluate based on opponent's postflop tendencies (they bet flop once, folded another time)\n- Checking keeps pot small with marginal hand\n\n**Postflop Plan:** If I hit Ace, proceed cautiously. If I hit 4, likely still behind. If opponent bets aggressively postflop, fold.\n\n**Final Decision:** Check",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: 4d Ac (Ace-high with a backdoor flush draw)\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Stack: 321 chips (20.1 BB)\n- Board: 9c 5c 6d\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- Opponent: DeepSeek-V3.2 in SB position\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at DeepSeek-V3.2's recent actions:\n- Very tight preflop: folds most hands, occasionally checks or raises\n- When they do play, they tend to be aggressive postflop (see hands 56 and 59 where they bet on flop)\n- They check-folded on flop in hand 63\n- They seem to play straightforwardly - aggressive when they have something, check/fold when they don't\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Preflop: SB called 8, I checked BB\n- Flop: SB checked to me\n- I have Ace-high with no pair, but I have a backdoor nut flush draw (need two more clubs)\n- The board is 9c 5c 6d - somewhat coordinated with straight and flush draws possible\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Weak - just Ace-high, but Ace of clubs gives me backdoor nut flush potential\n2. **Position**: Good - I'm on the button, acting last\n3. **Opponent tendency**: They checked, which likely means weakness. When they have strong hands, they tend to bet (see hands 56 and 59)\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 32, I can check for free\n5. **Tournament situation**: I have a healthy stack (20 BB), no need to take unnecessary risks\n\nGiven that opponent checked and shows a pattern of betting when strong, checking here seems appropriate. I could consider a small bluff bet since I have position and the Ace of clubs gives me some equity, but with Ace-high on a somewhat coordinated board, it's risky. The opponent might call with any pair or draw.\n\nSince checking is free and I have some backdoor equity, I should check and see the turn card.",

Check behind - betting here is risky as I don't have much equity if called\n2. I have position and can see the river for free\n3.

While I could consider a bluff given my blocker and opponent's passivity, the risk isn't worth it in a tournament setting with a healthy stack. Checking and taking the free showdown is the safest play.\n\nLet me reconsider - actually, this might be a good bluffing spot. The opponent has shown passivity, I have position, and I have the Ac blocker. A small bet might fold out some weak pairs or missed draws. However, given that we've checked through the entire hand, opponent might have some showdown value they're willing to call with. \n\nGiven my tournament stack is healthy at 20+ BB, I should be more conservative. Checking is the better play here to avoid unnecessary risk.",

Looking at their history:\n- They fold preflop quite often (hands 53,54,57,58,60,61,62)\n- They sometimes check preflop (55,59,63,64)\n- When they do raise preflop (hand 56), they made it 60 and then bet aggressively on flop\n- Overall seems like a somewhat tight/passive player\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 6c 5h is terrible. Not suited, not connected, low cards. This is a fold in almost any situation.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, the worst position. I'll be first to act postflop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 21.6 BB, which is a decent stack. I don't need to take risks with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 40 to win 72, which is about 1.8:1. That's not great odds for a hand this weak.\n\n5. **Opponent tendency**: DeepSeek seems to raise with decent hands. Their preflop raise to 48 suggests strength.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. There's no need to gamble with 65o from the worst position. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, my position is bad, and I have no need to take this risk.",

It has good straight potential and is playable in position.\n\n2. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents have been folding a lot recently. Seat 3 just raised in hand 65, but otherwise has been tight. Seat 2 has been folding frequently.\n\n3. **Position advantage**: Being on the button is huge - I'll act last postflop.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1), which is reasonable for QJo on the button.\n\n5. **Stack preservation**: With 21.6 BB, I can afford to see a flop here. \n\nI'm in a prime position to make a strategic move. A standard raise of 3x the big blind offers excellent risk-reward potential. At 48 chips, the raise represents a minimal 14% of my stack while potentially scooping up the blinds. My button position provides maximum flexibility, and the opponents' recent tight play suggests they're likely to fold. The 3x sizing feels just right - not too aggressive, but enough to apply meaningful pressure and potentially take down the pot preflop.",

Let me break down the key information:\n\n**My Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - Seat 1\n- Cards: 6s 8s (suited connectors, 6 and 8 of spades)\n- Stack: 369 chips (23.1 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (SB) - 298 chips\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB) - 292 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) - SB:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 60: Preflop raise to 24 (1.5x BB)\n- Hand 61: Preflop fold\n- Hand 62: Preflop call 47 (facing a raise)\n- Hand 63: Preflop call 8 (just completed SB), then flop check and fold\n- Hands 64-67: Preflop folds (4 consecutive folds)\n- Hand 68: No data shown but likely fold\n\nShowdowns:\n- Hand 30: Showdown with Tc 7d (weak hand)\n- Hand 57: Showdown with 4d 4s (pocket pair)\n- Hand 62: Showdown with 5s Kc (King high)\n\n**Pattern:** Seems to be playing relatively tight. Raises occasionally but folds frequently. Has shown down with weak hands like T7o and K5o. Not particularly aggressive.\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - BB:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 63: Flop check and fold (after defending BB)\n- Hand 64: Preflop call 8, then check-check-check through river (very passive)\n- Hand 65: Preflop raise to 48 (3x BB - significant aggression)\n- Hands 66-68: Preflop folds (3 consecutive folds)\n\nShowdown:\n- Hand 64: Showdown with 2s Ts (weak hand)\n\n**Pattern:** Generally passive, but occasionally makes large preflop raises (like Hand 65: 48 chips). Defends BB sometimes but plays passively postflop. Has folded to pressure.\n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n1. **My Hand:** 6s 8s is a suited connector. This hand plays well in position, can make straights and flushes, and benefits from seeing flops cheaply. On the button, this is a good spot to see a flop.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the button - the best position. I will act last on every street postflop.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes:** \n   - I have 23.1 BB (369 chips)\n   - SB has 18.6 BB (298 chips)\n   - BB has 18.25 BB (292 chips)\n   - We're all in similar stack territory - not super deep but not desperate yet.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** \n   - Pot is 24, I need to call 16\n   - Getting 1.5:1 immediate pot odds\n   - But implied odds are more important with a suited connector\n\n5. **Opponent Tendencies:**\n   - Both opponents have been folding frequently (4+ consecutive folds for SB, 3+ for BB)\n   - BB occasionally makes large preflop raises (up to 48 chips)\n   - Both play passively postflop\n   - Neither seems particularly strong or aggressive overall\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:**\n   - Blinds are 8/16, so they're meaningful but not critical\n   - My stack is healthy at 23 BB\n   - Losing 16 chips wouldn't hurt much\n   - Winning chips would help build stack\n\n**Decision Options:**\n\n1. **Fold:** Too tight. 6s 8s on the button is a perfectly playable hand, especially against opponents who have been folding a lot.\n\n2. **Call:** The standard play. I get to see a flop in position with a hand that can make strong disguised hands (straights, flushes). The cost is reasonable (16 chips).\n\n3. **Raise:** \n   - Minimum raise to 32 (2x BB)\n   - Could potentially take down the pot immediately\n   - But risks more chips with a marginal hand\n   - SB and BB have shown they can fold to raises\n\n**My Recommendation:**\n\nI think **calling** is the best play here. Here's why:\n\n- **Hand Strength:** 6s 8s is not strong enough to raise for value, but it's too good to fold on the button\n- **Position:** Being on the button is crucial - I'll see how both opponents act before I make any postflop decisions\n- **Pot Control:** Calling keeps the pot"

          "reasoning_content": "  I need to analyze this situation carefully. Let me break down the key information:\n\n**My Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - Seat 1\n- Cards: 6s 8s (suited connectors, 6 and 8 of spades)\n- Stack: 369 chips (23.1 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (SB) - 298 chips\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB) - 292 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) - SB:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 60: Preflop raise to 24 (1.5x BB)\n- Hand 61: Preflop fold\n- Hand 62: Preflop call 47 (facing a raise)\n- Hand 63: Preflop call 8 (just completed SB), then flop check and fold\n- Hands 64-67: Preflop folds (4 consecutive folds)\n- Hand 68: No data shown but likely fold\n\nShowdowns:\n- Hand 30: Showdown with Tc 7d (weak hand)\n- Hand 57: Showdown with 4d 4s (pocket pair)\n- Hand 62: Showdown with 5s Kc (King high)\n\n**Pattern:** Seems to be playing relatively tight. Raises occasionally but folds frequently. Has shown down with weak hands like T7o and K5o. Not particularly aggressive.\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - BB:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 63: Flop check and fold (after defending BB)\n- Hand 64: Preflop call 8, then check-check-check through river (very passive)\n- Hand 65: Preflop raise to 48 (3x BB - significant aggression)\n- Hands 66-68: Preflop folds (3 consecutive folds)\n\nShowdown:\n- Hand 64: Showdown with 2s Ts (weak hand)\n\n**Pattern:** Generally passive, but occasionally makes large preflop raises (like Hand 65: 48 chips). Defends BB sometimes but plays passively postflop. Has folded to pressure.\n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n1. **My Hand:** 6s 8s is a suited connector.

In early position this is a fold, but I'm on the button which is better.\n\n2. **My position**: Button (best position post-flop)\n\n3. **My stack**: 353 chips (22.1 BB) - relatively healthy but not deep\n\n4. **The action**: \n   - I called the BB of 16\n   - SB (Seat 2) raised to 48 (3x my call)\n   - BB folded\n   - I need to call 32 more (total pot would be 80 + 32 = 112 if I call)\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 to win 80, so 32/112 = 28.6% equity needed\n\n6. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at Seat 2's history:\n   - They've been fairly active with mixed strategies\n   - Recent hands show they raised preflop in hand 60, called in 62,63\n   - They've shown down with weak hands like 44, T7o, K5s\n   - They seem to be a loose-aggressive player who raises with a wide range\n\n7. **Hand equity**: 6s8s against a wide range probably has around 35-40% equity, which is enough given pot odds\n\n8. **Position advantage**: Being on the button gives me huge advantage post-flop\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I have 22 BB, so I can afford to see a flop here\n   - This is a good spot to try to accumulate chips against a loose opponent\n   - If I hit a strong draw or hand, I can put pressure on them\n\nThe raise size is small enough (32 more to call) that I have good implied odds with suited connectors. I should call and see a flop in position.\n\nI could also consider raising, but with 6s8s I'd rather just call and see a flop. A re-raise would be too aggressive with this hand.\n\nDecision: Call 32",

This is a very strong hand - I have trips with an 8 kicker. The only hands that beat me are:\n- Pocket Queens (full house)\n- 6-X (where X > 8, giving me a lower kicker)\n- A higher pocket pair that makes a full house\n\n**Action Analysis**:\n- Preflop: Opponent raised from SB to 48, I called with 6s 8s\n- Flop: Opponent bets 80 into a pot of 112 (preflop: 16+48+48 = 112)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2)**:\nLooking at the recall data:\n- This opponent is relatively passive post-flop (lots of checking and folding)\n- They've shown down with weak hands like 4-4, 5-K, T-7\n- They raised preflop in hand 56, 60 (small raises)\n- They've folded to pressure multiple times\n- In hand 62, they called preflop and ended up with K-5 on a Q-4-2-6-Q board (two pair on river)\n\nThe current bet of 80 seems strong - it's about 72% of the pot. Given the board texture (paired board with a Queen), this could be:\n- A Queen (top pair)\n- A pocket pair (trying to protect against draws)\n- A 6 (trip sixes with better kicker)\n- Air (bluff)\n\n**Pot Odds**:\nI need to call 80 to win 192, which gives me 2.4:1 pot odds. I need about 29.4% equity to call.\n\n**Stack Considerations**:\n- I have 321 chips left (20.1 BB)\n- If I call, pot becomes 272 and I have 241 left\n- If I raise to 160 (minimum), I'm committing about half my stack\n\n**My Position**:\nI'm on the button, which is favorable. I have position post-flop.\n\n**Decision**:\nI have trips, which is a very strong hand. Given that my opponent has shown tendencies to be passive and fold to pressure, and given that I have a strong hand with position, I should raise here to:\n1. Get value from weaker hands (Queens, pocket pairs)\n2. Protect against draws (though there aren't many on this board)\n3. Put pressure on the opponent\n\nHowever, I need to consider that if they have a Queen, they might call. If they have a 6 with a better kicker, I'm in trouble. But given their passive nature, they might be betting a Queen or weaker hand.\n\nLooking at their showdown history, they play relatively weak hands. The 80 bet could be a protection bet with a Queen or medium pocket pair.\n\nI think raising is the best play. I can raise to 160 (minimum) or go all-in. Given my stack size and the pot size, a raise to 160 seems reasonable - it applies pressure but doesn't commit my entire stack yet.\n\nLet me reconsider - the pot is 192, they're betting 80. If I raise to 160, I'm giving them 2:1 odds to call. They might call with a Queen. If I go all-in for 321, I'm giving them about 1.6:1 odds.\n\nActually, with trips on a relatively dry board, I should be looking to get value. The opponent's bet of 80 suggests they have something. I should raise for value. Given my stack size and the pot size, I can raise to 200-240 to really put pressure on.\n\nBut wait - the minimum raise is 160. Let me think about the sizing:\n- Call 80: Pot becomes 272, I have 241 left\n- Raise to 160: Total investment 160, pot becomes 352 if they call, I have 161 left\n\nActually, if I raise to 160, that's only adding 80 more to their 80 bet, which is essentially a min-raise. That might not achieve much.\n\nGiven I have trips and position, and given the opponent's passive tendencies, I should raise bigger to:\n1. Get maximum value from hands like Qx\n2. Charge them heavily if they're drawing\n3. Potentially take down the pot now if they're weak\n\nWith 321 stack and 192 pot, I could go all-in here. That would be a strong play with trips, and it maximizes pressure on a passive opponent.\n\nLet"

But given their passive nature, they might be betting a Queen or weaker hand.\n\nLooking at their showdown history, they play relatively weak hands. The 80 bet could be a protection bet with a Queen or medium pocket pair.\n\nI think raising is the best play. I can raise to 160 (minimum) or go all-in. Given my stack size and the pot size, a raise to 160 seems reasonable - it applies pressure but doesn't commit my entire stack yet.\n\nLet me reconsider - the pot is 192, they're betting 80. If I raise to 160, I'm giving them 2:1 odds to call. They might call with a Queen. If I go all-in for 321, I'm giving them about 1.6:1 odds.\n\nActually, with trips on a relatively dry board, I should be looking to get value. The opponent's bet of 80 suggests they have something. I should raise for value. Given my stack size and the pot size, I can raise to 200-240 to really put pressure on.\n\nBut wait - the minimum raise is 160. Let me think about the sizing:\n- Call 80: Pot becomes 272, I have 241 left\n- Raise to 160: Total investment 160, pot becomes 352 if they call, I have 161 left\n\nActually, if I raise to 160, that's only adding 80 more to their 80 bet, which is essentially a min-raise. That might not achieve much.\n\nGiven I have trips and position, and given the opponent's passive tendencies, I should raise bigger to:\n1. Get maximum value from hands like Qx\n2. Charge them heavily if they're drawing\n3. Potentially take down the pot now if they're weak\n\nWith 321 stack and 192 pot, I could go all-in here. That would be a strong play with trips, and it maximizes pressure on a passive opponent.\n\nLet",

          "reasoning_content": "  The user wants me to respond with a JSON object containing my action decision. Let me analyze the situation carefully:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: 6s 8s (trip sixes with 8 kicker)\n- Board: 6c 6d Qs\n- Position: BTN (button)\n- Stack: 321 chips (20.1 BB)\n- Pot: 192 chips\n- Opponent bet on flop: 80\n- Amount to call: 80\n- Minimum raise: 160\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have trip sixes (6-6-6-8-Q). This is a very strong hand, only beaten by:\n   - Pocket Queens (full house Q-Q-6-6-6)\n   - 6-X where X > 8 (better kicker)\n   - Higher pocket pairs that make a full house\n\n2. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the recall data, Kimi-K2 is relatively passive:\n   - Check-folds frequently on flop\n   - Makes small raises preflop (24 chips)\n   - Folds to pressure\n   - Has shown down weak hands\n\n3. **Current Action**: They raised preflop to 48 (from SB) and now bet 80 on flop (72% pot size)\n   - This could be a protection bet with a Queen\n   - Could be a pocket pair\n   - Could be a bluff\n   - Could be trip sixes with better kicker\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: Calling 80 to win 192 = 2.4:1, need ~29.4% equity\n\n5. **Stack Considerations**: I have 321 left. If I call, pot = 272, I have 241 left. If I raise to 160, pot = 352 if called, I have 161 left.\n\n6. **Position**: I'm on button, which is excellent\n\n**Decision**: I have a very strong hand (trips) against a passive opponent who is betting. I should raise for value and protection. Given my stack size and the pot size, and considering the opponent's passive nature, I should make a substantial raise.\n\nThe minimum raise is 160. Given that the opponent bet 80, raising to 160 is just a min-raise, which might not achieve much. I could raise more. \n\nLooking at my stack of 321, I could:\n- Raise to 200-240 to put real pressure\n- Go all-in for 321\n\nGiven the opponent's passive tendencies and the strength of my hand, I think raising to 200-240 is appropriate. However, the minimum raise is 160, and I need to specify the total amount I'm putting in.\n\nLet me think about the sizing more carefully. If I raise to 200:\n- I'm adding 120 to their 80 bet\n- Pot becomes 192 + 200 = 392\n- I have 121 left\n\nThis seems like a good sizing - it's substantial enough to get value and apply pressure, but doesn't commit my entire stack.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With trips on a board that's not too draw-heavy, I want to get value from hands like Qx, pocket pairs, etc. The opponent's 80 bet suggests they have something. I should raise for value.\n\nGiven the pot is 192 and they bet 80, and I have 321 behind:\n- A raise to 200-240 seems appropriate\n- Going all-in for 321 is also an option, maximizing pressure\n\nI think I'll raise to 200. This is a solid raise that:\n1. Gets value from weaker hands\n2. Applies pressure to a passive opponent\n3. Doesn't overcommit my stack if they have me beat\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Looking at the opponent's preflop raise from SB to 48, then betting 80 on this flop - this shows strength. They could have:\n- A Queen (top pair)\n- Pocket pair (trying to protect)\n- A 6 with better kicker\n- Air (bluff)\n\nGiven I have trip sixes with an 8 kicker, I'm losing to:\n- Pocket Queens (full house)\n- A6, K6, Q6, J6, T6, 96 (all have better kickers)\n- 66 (quad sixes)\n\nBut given the opponent's passive history, would they really bet 80 with just a 6? They might, but it's less likely. More likely they have a Queen or pocket pair.\n\nI have a strong hand and position. I should raise. Let me go with a raise to 200.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My Hand**: Ah 8s - Ace-high with an 8 kicker. This is a decent but not premium hand. It's suited in hearts but the 8 is low. \n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. I get to act last on every street.\n\n3. **Stack**: 513 chips (32.1 BB) - This is a healthy stack, above 30 BB.\n\n4. **Opponent**: Only one opponent left (Seat 2: Kimi-K2) with 162 chips (10.1 BB). This is a short stack.\n\n5. **Action**: \n   - Blinds are 8/16\n   - Pot is 24 chips\n   - I need to call 8 to see the flop (getting 3:1 odds)\n   - I can raise to minimum 32\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the opponent's history:\n   - They fold a lot preflop (hands 58, 61, 64, 65, 66, 67, 70)\n   - When they do play, they sometimes raise (hands 60, 69)\n   - In hand 69, they raised preflop to 48, then bet 80 on flop and folded\n   - They have shown down weak hands like Tc 7d, 4d 4s, 5s Kc\n   - They seem to play somewhat tight but can be aggressive\n\n7. **My recent BTN play**: I've been active on the button, sometimes raising, sometimes calling. I've won some decent pots.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - This is a heads-up situation (only me and one opponent with chips)\n   - The opponent has a short stack (10 BB)\n   - I have a healthy stack\n   - I should try to pressure the short stack\n\n**Decision**: With Ace-high on the button against a short stack, I should raise. This puts pressure on the short stack and gives me initiative. A standard raise would be to about 2.5-3x the BB, so around 40-48 chips. The minimum raise is 32, which is also reasonable.\n\nLet me raise to 40 or 48. Given the opponent's tendency to fold a lot, a raise to 40 (2.5x BB) should be enough to pressure them.",

Only raised once (hand 69) and bet on flop\n- Showdown hands: Tc7d, 4d4s, 5sKc - mixed holdings but generally tight\n- Conclusion: Ultra-tight player, only plays strong hands\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - BB:**\n- Recent actions: check, check, check, raise, fold, fold, fold, fold, fold\n- Pattern: Tight but more active than SB. Raised once (hand 65)\n- Showdown: 2sTs - weak hand but checked down\n- Conclusion: Tight player, but will defend BB sometimes\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 6h 3c is one of the worst starting hands in poker\n- Offsuit, no connectivity, low cards\n- Even in position, this hand has very poor equity\n- We're 33.6 BB deep - need to preserve chips\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** Extremely weak, bottom 5% of hands\n2. **Position:** BTN is good, but can't overcome hand weakness\n3. **Opponents:** Both tight players, SB especially nitty\n4. **Pot Odds:** Need to call 16 to win 24 = 40% immediate pot odds\n5. **Tournament:** We're in decent chip position, no need to gamble\n6. **Raise Option:** Could steal blinds, but both players are tight and may defend\n\n**Stealing Consideration:**\n- Could raise to 32-48 as a steal attempt\n- SB folds 90% of time based on history\n- BB folds 70% of time based on history\n- However, if called, we're in terrible shape postflop\n- Risk/reward isn't worth it with this hand\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, opponents are tight enough that stealing isn't profitable enough, and we don't need to take unnecessary risks with a healthy stack.\n\n**Action:** Fold",

It's offsuit and can be dominated by AQ, KQ, AJ.\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB, so I'll be out of position postflop.\n3. **Opponent**: The opponent has been raising preflop with a mix of hands including premiums (KK) and weaker hands. The raise size of 40 (2.5x BB) is moderate.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 24 to win 64, giving me about 2.67:1 odds. This is reasonable.\n5. **Stack sizes**: I have a healthy 32.6 BB stack, so I can afford to see flops.\n6. **Tournament**: With a medium stack, I should be looking to accumulate chips but not take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Decision**: \nQJo from BB facing a moderate raise from a player who seems to raise with a wide range. The pot odds are decent. However, being out of position with a hand that can be dominated is concerning.\n \nI see the raise is small enough to warrant a call. The 2.5x BB sizing suggests my opponent might have a weaker range, giving me a chance to see the flop without committing too many chips. The 24-chip call represents minimal risk to my 521-chip stack, allowing me to potentially outplay them postflop despite my positional disadvantage. I'll defend my blind and see what develops on the flop.",

Wait, let me re-read).\n\nActually, looking at the hand history again:\n- Preflop: Seat 2 raised to 40, Seat 3 folded, I called\n- Now we're on the flop\n- The \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests it's checked to me\n\nWait, the format says \"Actions this hand\" but only shows preflop actions. So on the flop, no one has acted yet. Since I'm BB and the action goes clockwise, Seat 2 (the preflop raiser) would act first on the flop. But the \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests it's checked to me, which means Seat 2 must have checked.\n\nSo the action is: Seat 2 checked, and now it's my turn.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- Qh Js on a 5h 7s 3c board\n- I have two overcards (Q and J)\n- No pair, no draw really (except backdoor flush draw with Qh)\n- The board is relatively dry and disconnected\n- My cards are suited (hearts) but the board has 5h only\n\n**Opponent analysis (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see Seat 2's recent actions:\n- Hand 72: Raised preflop to 154 (big raise), then checked down flop, turn, river (had KK)\n- Hand 69: Raised preflop to 48, bet 80 on flop, then folded\n- Hand 60: Raised preflop to 24\n- Hand 62: Called preflop 47\n- Hand 63: Called preflop 8, checked flop, folded to action\n- Many preflop folds\n\n**Key observations about Seat 2:**\n1. They raise preflop frequently (hands 60, 69, 72)\n2. When they have strong hands (like KK in hand 72), they check down postflop\n3. They sometimes c-bet (hand 69) but also give up\n4. Their stack is 276 chips (17.25 BB) - shorter than mine\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- I'm the preflop caller with a decent but not strong hand\n- The flop is very dry (5-7-3 rainbow essentially)\n- Seat 2 is the preflop aggressor but checked to me\n- This could mean:\n  a) They have a strong hand and are trapping\n  b) They missed the board and are giving up\n  c) They have a medium hand and want pot control\n\n- With QJs, I have two overcards which are good against many hands\n- If I bet, I might get folds from hands like AK, AQ, AJ that missed\n- If I check, I give a free card and might miss my overcard equity\n\n**Tournament context:**\n- I have a healthy stack (31.1 BB)\n- Opponent has 17.25 BB and is in \"medium stack\" territory\n- I should be looking to accumulate chips but also preserve my stack\n\n**Decision:**\nI think checking is the best option here. Here's why:\n1. I don't have a strong hand (just overcards)\n2. Seat 2 is the preflop aggressor - their check could be a trap with a strong hand\n3. If I bet, I risk getting check-raised which would put me in a tough spot\n4. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to realize my equity for free\n5. If the turn is a Q or J, I can get value then\n6. If the turn is a heart, I pick up a flush draw\n\nI could consider a small bet as a bluff, but against an unknown opponent who could be trapping, it's not worth the risk. The board is too dry for them to have hit much, but it's also too dry for me to represent much.\n\n**Final decision: Check**\n\nLet me format the JSON response:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n "

Their stack is 276 chips (17.25 BB) - shorter than mine\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- I'm the preflop caller with a decent but not strong hand\n- The flop is very dry (5-7-3 rainbow essentially)\n- Seat 2 is the preflop aggressor but checked to me\n- This could mean:\n  a) They have a strong hand and are trapping\n  b) They missed the board and are giving up\n  c) They have a medium hand and want pot control\n\n- With QJs, I have two overcards which are good against many hands\n- If I bet, I might get folds from hands like AK, AQ, AJ that missed\n- If I check, I give a free card and might miss my overcard equity\n\n**Tournament context:**\n- I have a healthy stack (31.1 BB)\n- Opponent has 17.25 BB and is in \"medium stack\" territory\n- I should be looking to accumulate chips but also preserve my stack\n\n**Decision:**\nI think checking is the best option here. Here's why:\n1. I don't have a strong hand (just overcards)\n2. Seat 2 is the preflop aggressor - their check could be a trap with a strong hand\n3. If I bet, I risk getting check-raised which would put me in a tough spot\n4. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to realize my equity for free\n5. If the turn is a Q or J, I can get value then\n6. If the turn is a heart, I pick up a flush draw\n\nI could consider a small bet as a bluff, but against an unknown opponent who could be trapping, it's not worth the risk. The board is too dry for them to have hit much, but it's also too dry for me to represent much.\n\n**Final decision: Check**\n\nLet me format the JSON response:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n ",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Kd 7d - This is a marginal hand. It's suited, which gives some potential for flushes, but the King is dominated by many hands (any Ace, any King with a better kicker). It's not a great hand to play, especially out of position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB (small blind), which is the worst position post-flop. I'll be acting first on every street.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 489 chips (30.6 BB). This is a healthy stack, so I can afford to be selective.\n\n4. **The action**: \n   - Blinds are 8/16\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised to 122 (a large raise of about 7.6x the big blind)\n   - I need to call 114 to see the flop\n   - Pot will be 146 + 114 = 260 if I call\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for DeepSeek-V3.2:\n   - They folded preflop in hands 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 73 (6 out of 7 recent hands)\n   - They called in hand 72 with Qc Ah (a premium hand)\n   - They showed down 2s Ts in hand 64 and Qc Ah in hand 72\n   - This suggests they're playing very tight - only entering pots with strong hands\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 114 to win 260, which is about 2.3:1 pot odds. This is not great for a marginal hand like K7s.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 30BB, I should be looking for better spots. K7s from SB against a tight player's large raise is not a profitable situation.\n\n8. **Hand equity**: K7s has about 35-40% equity against a typical raising range from a tight player (which would include big pairs, AK, AQ, etc.). The pot odds don't justify this call, especially out of position.\n\nThe raise size of 122 from a player who usually folds suggests they have a very strong hand. My K7s is easily dominated and I'm out of position. This is a clear fold.",

This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN) which is great position, but with a terrible hand like 46o, position doesn't help much.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 in SB): Has been folding a lot preflop (hands 70, 71, 74), but made a big raise in hand 72 (154 chips) with KK and showed down. Also made a smaller raise in hand 73 (40 chips). So capable of raises with strong hands.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB): Very tight - has folded preflop in hands 68, 69, 70, 71, 73. Only played hand 72 (called 138 chips with AQ) and made a raise in hand 74 (122 chips). So when they play, they seem to have strong hands.\n\n**Stack Sizes**: \n- I have 489 chips (30.6 BB) - healthy stack\n- Seat 2 has 340 chips (21.25 BB)\n- Seat 3 has 130 chips (8.1 BB) - short stack\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With a 30 BB stack, I should be selective. 46o is a trash hand that doesn't warrant a call even with good position, especially against opponents who play tight/strong ranges.\n\n**Pot Odds**: Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1). Not relevant with such a weak hand.\n\nThis is a clear fold. The opponents play tight ranges when they enter pots, and 46o has virtually no equity against any reasonable calling/raising range. Even on the button, this is not a profitable call.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Th 6c (Ten of hearts, six of clubs) - This is a very weak hand, unsuited, not connected, and my ten is not strong enough to call raises with.\n\n**Position**: BB (Big Blind) - Not great, but I'm already invested with 16 chips.\n\n**Stack**: 473 chips (29.6 BB) - Healthy stack, tournament situation.\n\n**Current action**:\n- SB posted 8\n- BB (me) posted 16\n- Seat 2 raised to 48\n- Seat 3 re-raised to 122\n\n**Pot**: 186 chips\n**Amount to call**: 106 chips\n**Minimum raise to**: 196 chips\n\n**Opponent analysis from recent actions**:\n\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n- Has been raising preflop frequently (hands 72, 73, 75, 76)\n- In hand 72, raised 154 with KK (showdown)\n- In hand 73, raised 40 and bet flop\n- Seems like an aggressive player who raises with strong hands\n- Has 316 chips (19.75 BB)\n\nSeat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2):\n- Usually folds preflop (hands 69, 70, 71, 73, 75)\n- In hand 72, called 138 preflop with AQ (showdown)\n- In hand 74, raised 122 preflop (this is the same raise size as current hand!)\n- Has only 8 chips left (0.5 BB) - this is a short stack\n\n**Key insight**: Seat 3 is extremely short stacked with only 8 chips (0.5 BB). They're making a raise to 122 which is putting them all-in or almost all-in. This suggests they have a strong hand and are trying to get value before they get blinded out.\n\n**Hand evaluation**: Th 6c is a trash hand. I should be folding this 100% of the time in a normal situation.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 106 to win 186 \u2192 106/(186+106) = 106/292 = 36.3% equity needed.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have a healthy stack (29.6 BB)\n- Seat 3 is desperate with 0.5 BB\n- Seat 2 is aggressive and likely has a strong hand\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. I have a terrible hand, I'm facing aggression from two players, one of whom is desperate and likely has a strong hand. Even if I had pot odds, T6o is never going to have enough equity against two players' ranges. \n\nThis is especially true given that Seat 3 is short-stacked and making a big raise (relative to their stack), which typically indicates strength. I should preserve my tournament chips and wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"T6o is a very weak hand with no connectivity or suitedness.

They have a short stack (13.6 BB) and might be looking to get their money in.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, which is 3:1 odds. This is good pot odds.\n\n**Hand analysis**: Jh 5s is a terrible hand. Even with good pot odds, this hand has very little equity against any reasonable raising range. It's offsuit, not connected, and the Jack is weak without a kicker.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 29.1 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities. Calling here would be burning chips.\n\n**If I call**: \n- I'm out of position postflop (opponent is in BB)\n- I have a weak hand that will rarely hit strongly\n- I'll likely face aggression from this opponent\n- Even if I hit a Jack, I'll be dominated by better Jacks\n- If I hit a 5, it's unlikely to be good\n\n**If I raise**: \n- Minimum raise is to 32, which is 2 BB\n\n\n- Raising would commit too many chips with a weak hand\n- Opponent's aggressive nature means they might re-raise\n- I'd be risking valuable chips unnecessarily\n\nThe most prudent move is to fold. Despite tempting pot odds, the hand's fundamental weakness and opponent's aggressive tendencies make this an easy decision. I'll wait for a stronger hand to invest my chips.",

It can make straights and flushes, but is weak against typical raising ranges.\n2. **Position**: Being on BTN is great - I get to act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent stacks**: Both are short-stacked.

I can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position.\n\n**Key insight**: Since both opponents are short-stacked and I have position, calling 16 chips (1 BB) to see a flop with a suited connector is reasonable. The implied odds are good because:\n- If I hit a strong hand (flush, straight, two pair), I can potentially win 234-244 chips\n- I'm only investing 16 chips (1 BB)\n- I'm in position, which gives me control postflop\n\nHowever, I should also consider that these opponents have shown they can be aggressive, and 85s is easily dominated.

Looking at the opponent data more carefully:\n- Seat 2 raises frequently and can be aggressive postflop\n- Seat 3 makes big raises (122 chips) when they enter\n- Both have shown they can play strong hands\n\n85s is a very marginal hand. While the price is cheap and position is good, I'm not getting great immediate pot odds (40% equity needed), and 85s typically has much less equity against typical raising ranges.\n\nGiven that both opponents are short-stacked and likely to shove or play aggressively, and that 85s is a weak hand that will often be dominated or drawing thin, I think the correct play is to **fold**. \n\nThe tournament consideration is key here - while I have a healthy stack, preserving chips and waiting for better spots is important. 85s is just too weak to play against two opponents where I'll often be dominated.\n\nWait, but no one has raised yet - it's just the blinds. So I can see the flop for 16 chips. Let me think about the EV:\n\n- If I call 16 chips, I can potentially win 234-244 chips (14-15x my investment)\n- I need to hit a strong hand - I'll flop a flush draw ~11%, a straight draw ~10%, two pair ~2%\n- Combined, I have decent equity to continue on the flop\n\nGiven I'm in position, the cheap price, and the potential to win short stacks, I think **calling** is actually the better play.

I have position\n2. The opponent showed weakness by checking\n3. My opponent is tight and likely to fold marginal hands\n4. The board isn't too coordinated to represent a strong hand\n\nHowever, I need to be careful with my stack size. A standard c-bet would be 20-30 chips (half pot to 75% pot). That would be about 5-7% of my stack, which is reasonable.\n\nLet me make a small c-bet to try to take it down now.",

Despite opponent's history of frequent raises, risking nearly half my stack with this hand is not a profitable tournament play. Preserve stack for better spots.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- My hand: Jd 2d (Jack of diamonds, 2 of diamonds) - a very weak hand, offsuit but both diamonds\n- My position: BB (Big Blind)\n- My stack: 473 chips (29.6 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 258 chips\n- Amount to call: 218 chips\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 in Seat 2\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent actions from Seat 2 (Kimi-K2), I can see:\n- They have a history of frequent raises preflop (hands 69, 72, 73, 75, 76)\n- They raised to 234 chips this hand, which is essentially all-in (they have 234 chips total based on the raise amount)\n- In previous hands, they've shown down: Tc7d, 4d4s, 5sKc, KhKs, TdQc\n- Their raise sizes vary: 40, 48, 154, 234\n- They seem to raise with a wide range including weak hands like Tc7d and medium pairs like 44\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nJd 2d is a very weak hand. Even though they're both diamonds (suited), the ranks are very low. This hand has very poor equity against almost any raising range.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot before call: 258 chips\n- Amount to call: 218 chips\n- Pot odds: 258:218 or about 1.18:1\n- Required equity: 218/(258+218) = 218/476 = 45.8%\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: J2s is extremely weak. Even against a wide raising range, this hand is a significant underdog.\n2. **Stack Size**: I have 473 chips, which is healthy at 29.6 BB. Calling 218 chips would cost me 46% of my stack.\n3. **Opponent Tendency**: Opponent appears to raise frequently and with a wide range. However, this specific raise to 234 chips (essentially all-in) suggests significant strength or a desperate move.\n4. **Tournament Consideration**: I'm not short-stacked. Risking 46% of my stack with J2s is not a good tournament play.\n\n**Equity Calculation:**\nEven if opponent is raising with a very wide range (like top 50% of hands), J2s has roughly 30-35% equity. I need 45.8% equity to make this call profitable based on pot odds.\n\nThe only consideration is that the opponent might be making a desperate move with a very wide range. But even then, J2s is just too weak to call off nearly half my stack.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, the cost is too high relative to my stack, and I don't have the required equity even against a wide raising range.",

I have Q3 offsuit (clubs). It's a weak hand. I'm on the button, which is good position.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**:\nI recalled actions for \"Kimi-K2\" (the opponent in Seat 2). Let me review their tendencies:\n\nFrom the data:\n- Hand 66: preflop fold\n- Hand 67: preflop fold\n- Hand 69: preflop raise 48, flop bet 80, then fold (they raised, bet big, then folded)\n- Hand 70: preflop fold\n- Hand 71: preflop fold\n- Hand 72: preflop raise 154 (big raise), check flop, check turn, check river (went to showdown)\n- Hand 73: preflop raise 40, flop bet 48\n- Hand 74: preflop fold\n- Hand 75: preflop raise 48\n- Hand 76: preflop raise 48, then call 74 (someone raised them), flop bet 74\n- Hand 78: preflop fold\n- Hand 79: preflop raise 234 (very big raise)\n\nShowdowns: None (empty array)\n\nSo this opponent has been raising a lot preflop:\n- Raises in hands: 69, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79\n- Folds in hands: 66, 67, 70, 71, 74, 78\n\nThey seem to be playing quite aggressively preflop, raising frequently. The raise sizes vary: 48, 154, 40, 48, 48, 234. They seem to like raising to about 3x BB (48 is 3x 16 BB), but sometimes make big raises (154, 234).\n\nThey also seem to continuation bet on the flop when they raise preflop (hands 69, 73, 76).\n\nHowever, I don't have showdown data, so I don't know what hands they had when they raised.\n\n**My Hand**: Q3 offsuit (clubs). This is a very weak hand. Q-high is not good. The 3 is a low kicker. Even though they're suited (clubs), the suit doesn't matter much unless I hit a flush, which is unlikely.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position postflop. However, since the opponent is in the big blind and has already posted 16, and I only need to call 8 more, the pot odds are attractive.\n\n**Pot Odds**: Pot is 24 (my SB 8 + opponent's BB 16). I need to call 8. So I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (24:8). That's 25% equity needed to break even.\n\n**My Stack**: 465 chips (29.1 BB). This is a healthy stack. I can afford to fold and preserve my stack.\n\n**Opponent's Stack**: 242 chips (15.1 BB). They're shorter stacked than me.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: This is a tournament. Stack preservation is important, but so is accumulating chips. With a medium stack (29 BB), I should be somewhat selective.\n\n**Decision Factors**:\n1. **Hand Strength**: Very weak. Q3 offsuit is a fold in most situations.\n2. **Position**: Good (button), but hand is too weak.\n3. **Opponent's Tendency**: They raise frequently preflop. If I call, they might raise (but they already posted BB and haven't raised yet this"

I need to call 8. So I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (24:8). That's 25% equity needed to break even.\n\n**My Stack**: 465 chips (29.1 BB). This is a healthy stack. I can afford to fold and preserve my stack.\n\n**Opponent's Stack**: 242 chips (15.1 BB). They're shorter stacked than me.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: This is a tournament. Stack preservation is important, but so is accumulating chips. With a medium stack (29 BB), I should be somewhat selective.\n\n**Decision Factors**:\n1. **Hand Strength**: Very weak. Q3 offsuit is a fold in most situations.\n2. **Position**: Good (button), but hand is too weak.\n3. **Opponent's Tendency**: They raise frequently preflop. If I call, they might raise (but they already posted BB and haven't raised yet this",

They seem aggressive but we don't have showdown data to know their hand range.\n\n**My Hand**: Q3 offsuit is very weak. Even though it's suited, the chances of hitting a flush are low. Q-high with a 3 kicker is not a strong hand.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I'm getting 3:1 (calling 8 to win 24), which means I need 25% equity.

Let me analyze the hand completely:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 7s 5s (suited connector, but low)\n- Position: BTN\n- My stack: 433 chips (13.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 314 chips\n- To call: 218 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- If I call 218, the final pot will be 314 + 218 = 532\n- I'm risking 218 to win 532\n- Pot odds: 532:218 or 2.44:1\n- Equity needed: 218 / (314 + 218) = 218 / 532 = 41%\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n7s 5s is a weak hand. Even suited, it's low and easily dominated.\nAgainst a typical raising range (AA-22, AK-AT, KQ-KT, QJ, suited connectors down to 76s), I have approximately 30-35% equity.\nI need 41% equity to break even, so I'm not getting the right odds.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the hand history I can see:\n- Opponent makes large preflop raises (48, 154, 234, 250)\n- They showed down KK in hand #72 with a big raise\n- They seem to make big raises with strong hands\n- The current raise to 250 is a significant portion of my stack\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 13.5 BB, which is short but not desperate\n- Calling 218 would leave me with 215 chips (6.7 BB) if I lose\n- This is a high-risk, low-reward situation with a weak hand\n- Better spots will come\n\n**Decision:** FOLD\n\nI need to format this as JSON:\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"...\"\n}\n\nLet me write the reasoning concisely.",

Better to preserve my 12.5 BB stack for a better spot.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  The current situation:\n- I'm on the Button (BTN)\n- My cards: Qd 9s - this is a marginal hand, not very strong\n- My stack: 401 chips (12.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 220 chips\n- Amount to call: 156 chips\n- Minimum raise to: 344 chips\n\nLet me analyze:\n1. Hand strength: Q9 offsuit is a weak hand, especially in this situation\n2. Position: I'm on the button which is good position, but that doesn't help much with this weak hand\n3. Opponent: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has only 16 chips left and raised to 188. This is a massive overbet relative to their stack - they're essentially all-in or committing themselves. They posted the small blind and now raised big.\n4. Pot odds: I need to call 156 to win 220, which is about 1.4:1 pot odds. This is not great.\n5. Tournament considerations: I have 12.5 BB, which is a short stack but not desperate yet. Calling here would cost me 156/401 = 39% of my stack. If I lose, I'll be down to 245 chips (7.6 BB). If I win, I'll be at 557 chips (17.4 BB).\n\nGiven that DeepSeek-V3.2 only has 16 chips, their raise to 188 is strange. They posted 16 as SB, so they have 0 chips left after posting? Wait, let me check again:\n- Seat 3 posted SB 16\n- They have 16 chips total\n- They raised to 188\n\nThis doesn't make sense mathematically. If they have 16 chips and posted 16, they should have 0 left. Let me re-read...\n\nOh wait, the format might be showing their starting stack. Let me think about this differently. The player list shows:\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 16 chips\n\nSo they started the hand with 16 chips. They posted SB of 16, which would put them all-in automatically. But then it says \"preflop: Seat 3 raise 188\". This is contradictory.\n\nActually, looking more carefully, I think the \"16 chips\" might be their remaining stack AFTER posting the SB. So:\n- They had 32 chips to start\n- Posted SB 16, leaving 16\n- Then they raised to 188... which is impossible\n\nHmm, maybe the formatting means something else. Let me consider that they have 16 chips remaining and the raise to 188 is going all-in for their 16 chips plus the 16 they already posted = 32 total? No, that doesn't match either.\n \nI'm puzzled by the raise amount. The numbers don't add up - a player with only 16 chips can't raise to 188. There might be a misunderstanding about the chip counts or raise mechanics. The discrepancy suggests I need more information about the exact chip distribution and raise rules.\n\nThe raise puts me in a tough spot. With Q9 offsuit, I'm looking at marginal pot odds of 1.4:1. My stack would take a significant hit if I call and lose. The hand's strength doesn't justify the risk, especially against what looks like a strong hand from the opponent. I'm likely facing a premium hand like a high pocket pair or strong broadway cards.\n\nFolding seems the most prudent move to preserve my tournament life and wait for a better opportunity.",

Let me analyze:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- Cards: 2c Jc (Jack-2 suited) - weak hand, but suited\n- Stack: 385 chips (12 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the data for \"Kimi-K2\" (the BB), I can see:\n- They've been fairly active with raises preflop (hands 69, 72, 73, 75, 76, 79, 81)\n- They fold sometimes too (hands 70, 71, 74, 78, 82)\n- They make substantial raises (48, 154, 234, 250 chips)\n- In hand 76, they raised to 48, then called a re-raise to 74, then bet 74 on flop\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm on the button with 12 BB - this is a critical stack size\n- The other active player (Kimi-K2 in BB) has 298 chips (9.3 BB) - also short\n- I need to be looking for spots to accumulate chips\n- J2s is marginal but from the button with a short stack, it could be playable\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 48, I need to call 16\n- Getting 3:1 immediate odds\n- With 12 BB stack, calling 16 is 0.5 BB - not a huge portion\n\n**Decision:**\nWith J2s on the button and a short stack (12 BB), this is a fold. Here's why:\n1. J2s is a very weak hand, even suited\n2. While I have position, I'm out of position postflop against the BB\n3. The BB has shown aggression with raises\n4. With 12 BB, I should be more selective and look for better spots\n5. The suitedness gives some potential, but not enough to justify calling with this stack size\n\nI should fold and preserve my chips for a better opportunity. I need to be pushing all-in or folding with this stack size, not calling marginal hands.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent tendencies:\n\n**Seat 2 (SB) - Kimi-K2:**\n- Shows aggressive preflop behavior with multiple raises (hands 75, 76, 79, 81)\n- Has been caught bluffing or playing weaker hands (showed T7, 44, 5K in showdowns)\n- Recently went all-in with 250 chips preflop (hand 81)\n- Seems to play a wide range from SB\n\n**Seat 3 (BB) - DeepSeek-V3.2:**\n- Much more passive, folding a lot (hands 77, 79, 80, 81, 83)\n- Only showed aggression once with a raise of 188 in hand 82\n- Generally tight and cautious\n\n**My situation:**\n- Hand: Ad Jh (Ace-Jack suited) - This is a strong hand, especially on the button\n- Position: BTN (best position)\n- Stack: 385 chips (12 BB) - Short stack but not desperate yet\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- To call: 32 chips\n\nWith Ad Jh on the button, this is a strong hand. I have:\n1. **Hand strength**: AJ suited is a premium hand, especially in position\n2. **Position**: Button gives me advantage post-flop\n3. **Stack size**: 12 BB is short but I can still make a standard raise\n4. **Opponents**: SB is aggressive but can be bullied, BB is tight/passive\n\nGiven my short stack of 12 BB, I should be looking to either:\n- Fold and preserve chips (too weak for AJ)\n- Call and see a flop (not ideal with short stack)\n- Raise to apply pressure and potentially win preflop\n\nWith AJ suited on the button, I should raise. A standard raise would be 2.5-3x the BB, so about 80-96 chips. Since minimum raise is 64, I could raise to around 96 (3x BB).\n\nHowever, I need to consider that if I raise to 96 and get re-raised, I might have to fold or commit. With 12 BB, I could also consider a shove (all-in for 385) which would apply maximum pressure.\n\nLet me think about this:\n- If I raise to 96 (3x BB), I'm putting in about 25% of my stack\n- If I get re-raised, I'll likely have to fold, losing 25% of my stack\n- If I shove, I win the 48 chips in the pot if both fold (12.5% of my stack)\n- If called, I have a strong hand with good equity\n\nGiven the aggressive nature of SB and that I have a strong hand on the button, I think a standard raise is better than shoving. Shoving might only get called by better hands, while a raise might get folds from weaker hands or allow me to fold if re-raised.\n\nLet me raise to 96 (3x BB).",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**My hand**: 2s 5d - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and not connected.\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - Good position, but that doesn't help much with this terrible hand.\n\n**Stack**: 433 chips (13.5 BB) - This is a short stack in tournament play, getting close to the danger zone.\n\n**Blinds**: 16/32 - The big blind is 32 chips.\n\n**Pot**: 48 chips\n\n**Action**: I'm in the small blind position (posting 16), and I need to call 16 more to see the flop. Seat 2 is the big blind.\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Looking at the opponent actions for Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n- They fold quite often preflop (hands 70, 71, 74, 78, 82, 84, 85)\n- When they do raise, they raise to significant amounts (154, 234, 250 chips in recent hands)\n- They've shown some aggression with pocket pairs and good hands (showdown with Kh Ks in hand 72)\n- They seem to play relatively tight-aggressive\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 13.5 BB, I'm in the short stack territory. I need to be selective with my hands and look for spots to either steal blinds or get all-in with decent equity. \n\n**Hand equity**: 2-5 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. It has very little equity against any random hand, and even less against typical raising ranges.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 48, which is 3:1 pot odds. But even with these odds, 2-5 offsuit is just too weak. \n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Even though I'm getting 3:1 pot odds, 2-5 offsuit has such poor equity that it's not worth investing even 16 chips. With a short stack of 13.5 BB, I need to preserve my chips for much better spots. The opponent in the big blind has shown they can raise big, and even if they just check, I'm out of position post-flop with a terrible hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

Not a strong hand at all.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Good position, last to act post-flop.\n\n**Stack**: 385 chips (12.0 BB) - This is a short stack but not desperate yet.\n\n**Opponents**: \n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 222 chips (6.9 BB) - very short stacked\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 280 chips (8.75 BB) - also short stacked\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**:\n- Very active preflop with multiple raises (hands 79, 81, 87, 88)\n- Showdown hands include: 44, K5, KK, TQ, 2K\n- Seems to play a wide range, including weak hands like K2o, TQo, 44\n- Recently raised to 378 in hand 88 (which was almost all-in with ~12 BB)\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**:\n- Much more conservative, mostly folding preflop\n- Only raised once (hand 82 for 188) and called once (hand 88 for 140)\n- Showdown hands: 2T, QA, KT, AQ - stronger hands than Seat 2\n- Seems to play tighter, premium hands\n\n**Analysis**:\n- I have 8s5s which is a weak hand, but I'm on the button\n- Both opponents are short-stacked and may be looking to get their money in\n- Seat 2 is very aggressive and could raise/shove with a wide range\n- Seat 3 is tighter and would likely only call/raise with strong hands\n- Pot is 48, I need to call 32 to see flop (1.5:1 pot odds)\n- My hand has some potential if I hit a straight or flush, but it's very marginal\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have 12 BB which is short but workable\n- I should be selective with my hands\n- 8s5s is generally a fold from any position with a short stack\n\nThe only argument for calling is that I'm on the button and both opponents are short-stacked, so I might be able to steal the pot post-flop if they show weakness. However, with such a weak hand and short stack, it's better to preserve chips.\n\nI think this is a clear fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My Hand**: 5d 5c - Pocket 5s, a small pocket pair\n2. **Position**: SB (Small Blind) - out of position post-flop\n3. **Stack**: 385 chips (12 BB) - getting short but not desperate yet\n4. **Current situation**: \n   - Blinds: 16/32\n   - Pot: 144 chips\n   - Amount to call: 80 chips\n   - Facing a raise from DeepSeek-V3.2 in Seat 3\n\n5. **Opponent analysis (DeepSeek-V3.2)**:\n   - Looking at their preflop actions, they fold a LOT (hands 77, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 89, 90, 91)\n   - They've only raised preflop a few times: hands 76 (122), 82 (188), and now hand 92 (96)\n   - They called once in hand 88 (140)\n   - Showdowns show they've played Kc Ts, As Qc, Qc Ah - so they can have decent hands\n\n6. **My recent SB play**: I've been folding a lot from SB, only raising once in hand 71 with Ah 8s\n\n7. **Pot odds**: Need to call 80 to win 144, so about 1:1.8 or ~36% equity needed\n8. **Tournament situation**: 12 BB is getting short. Pocket pairs have good all-in equity against most ranges\n\nGiven that DeepSeek folds most of the time but has raised 3 times now, their range is likely strong but not necessarily premium. With 12 BB from SB, pocket 5s is a decent hand to defend or even reshove with.\n\nI could:\n- Fold: Conservative, preserves 369 chips (11.5 BB)\n- Call: Potentially set-mine but out of position with only 12 BB, which is not ideal\n- Raise/Shove: 3-bet all-in for 385 total\n\nWith 12 BB, calling 80 (2.5 BB) to set mine is not great since I won't have enough chips behind to get paid off if I hit. The better play is likely to either fold or shove.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature (lots of folds), a shove might get them to fold some decent hands. And if they call, pocket 5s has decent equity against their range.\n\nLet me calculate: If I shove 385, they're calling 289 more into a pot of 144+80+289 = 513, so they'd be getting ~1.8:1 on a call.\n\nI think the best play here is to shove. It puts maximum pressure and with 12 BB and a pocket pair, it's a standard tournament play.",

Very low unsuited cards with no connectivity.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is good, but with this hand it doesn't matter much.\n\n3. **Opponent stacks**: Both opponents are very short stacked (under 7 BB). They're in desperation mode.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - SB has been aggressive but recently folding a lot, possibly getting selective\n   - BB is very tight, folding most hands\n   \nWith my hand strength (very weak), I should fold. Even though I'm getting decent pot odds (32 to win 48, or 1.5:1), and I'm in position, 2-9 offsuit is just too weak to play, especially against short stacks who are likely to shove.\n\nThe only consideration is that both opponents are very short and might fold, allowing me to steal the blinds. However, with 16.5 BB, I still have some play left and shouldn't risk chips with such a weak hand. The BB is very tight and might fold, but the SB has shown aggression and could easily shove.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot. With 16.5 BB, I can afford to be patient and find a better hand to play, especially given my position.\n\nDecision: **FOLD**",

This is a marginal hand, especially out of position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB (worst position post-flop)\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 481 chips (15 BB) - short stack but not desperate yet\n\n4. **Action**: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised to 168, which is 5.25x BB. This is a large raise.\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at the recall data for DeepSeek-V3.2:\n   - Very tight player - folds most hands\n   - Only raised once before (hand #92) and then folded\n   - Called once (hand #88) with A Q and showed down\n   - When they show down, they have strong hands (AQ, KTs)\n   - This is an unusually large raise from a tight player\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is 216\n   - I need to call 152\n   - Pot odds: 216:152 or ~1.42:1\n   - This means I need ~41% equity to call profitably\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I'm one of the bigger stacks left (Seat 2 has 238, I'm at 481)\n   - Losing 152 chips would leave me with 329 (10.3 BB) - still playable\n   - But committing 1/3 of my stack with K8s out of position against a tight player's big raise is questionable\n\n8. **Implied odds**: Not great with K8s. If I hit a King, I could be dominated by better kickers. If I hit a flush, it could be second-best.\n\nGiven that DeepSeek-V3.2 is very tight and just made a large 5.25x raise, they're likely holding a premium hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK, AQ, JJ). My K8s is in bad shape against that range.\n\nThe pot odds aren't good enough to justify calling with this hand out of position, especially given the opponent's tight profile. I should fold and preserve my chips.\n\nHowever, let me consider if a re-raise (shove) could be an option. If I shove 481, the pot would be 697, giving Seat 3 about 1.45:1 odds to call. Against a tight player's range, I'm likely behind. And if they fold, I only win 216 chips. The risk/reward isn't great.\n\nBest play: **FOLD**",

Not connected, not suited, and the Q is dominated by many hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is good position, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 15 BB, which is in the \"short stack\" territory. At this stack depth, I should be playing very tight and looking for spots to shove or fold. Calling with marginal hands is generally bad with a short stack.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - SB has 222 chips (6.9 BB) - very short\n   - BB has 184 chips (5.75 BB) - very short\n   - Two players are already out\n\n5. **Tournament Consideration**: With 15 BB, I need to be selective. The SB and BB are both very short and might bust soon. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 32 to win 48, which is 1.5:1 odds. This would require 40% equity to be profitable. Q4o doesn't have that against any reasonable range.\n\n**Decision**: This is an easy fold. Q4o is just too weak to play, especially with a short stack. I should wait for a better hand or a better spot (like when the blinds are even shorter and I can pressure them).\n\nI don't need to recall any opponent actions here - this is a straightforward fold based on hand strength and stack size.",

Position: I'm on the BTN (Button), which is good position, but with a terrible hand this doesn't help much.\n\n3. Opponent tendencies: The opponent in BB (seat 2) has been raising preflop frequently - many raises of 48, 96, 222, 234, 250, 378 chips. They've shown aggression with a wide range. They also have some folds mixed in. Their stack is 238 chips (7.4 BB), so they're in shove/fold territory.\n\n4. Pot odds: I need to call 16 chips to win 48 chips, getting 3:1 odds. But with J6o, even these odds aren't good enough against an aggressive opponent who is likely to raise.\n\n5. Tournament considerations: I have 481 chips (15 BB). I'm not desperate yet, but I need to be careful. The opponent in BB has a shorter stack and might shove over my call.\n\nGiven that:\n- My hand is extremely weak (J6o)\n- The BB opponent is aggressive and likely to raise\n- I have a medium stack that I should preserve\n- The opponent has shown many preflop raises and could easily shove over my call\n\nI should fold this hand. The 16 chip call might seem small, but against an aggressive opponent with a shorter stack, I'm likely to face a raise that I'll have to fold to, or I'll be playing a weak hand out of position postflop (if they just check).\n\nEven with 3:1 pot odds, J6o is just too weak to play profitably here, especially against an aggressive opponent who will likely apply pressure.",

Very low cards, not suited, no straight potential unless you hit a 2-4-6 board which is extremely unlikely.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button which is good position, but that doesn't justify playing such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data, I can see that Kimi-K2 in Seat 2 (SB) has been raising frequently preflop with amounts like 48, 96, 222, 234, 250, 378. This suggests they're aggressive and willing to put chips in. They've also folded many times. The pattern shows they raise with a wide range.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 481 chips (15 BB)\n   - SB (Seat 2): 270 chips (8.4 BB) - short stack\n   - BB (Seat 3): 136 chips (4.25 BB) - very short stack\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 15 BB, I'm in the \"push/fold\" territory or close to it. I should be selective with my hands. 3-5 offsuit is definitely a fold.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 to win 48 (pot) = 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not enough to justify playing 3-5 offsuit.\n\n7. **Risk vs reward**: If I call, I'm putting in 2 BB with a terrible hand. The SB is aggressive and could easily raise me out of the pot, or the BB could shove their short stack. There's no upside here.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, my stack is too shallow to play marginal hands, and the pot odds don't justify it. I should save my chips for better spots.",

This is a large portion of my stack (286/449 = 64% of my stack).\n\n8. **Hand equity**: 5s7h has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a very wide range, this hand is likely <30% equity.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold.

Let me analyze this hand carefully.\n\nFirst, let me understand the situation:\n- This is Hand #101 - PREFLOP\n- My position: BTN (Button, Seat 1)\n- My cards: 3c Jd (Jack of diamonds, 3 of clubs)\n- My stack: 417 chips (6.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 96 chips\n- Players at table:\n  - Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 417 chips (me)\n  - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 302 chips (BB)\n  - Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 120 chips (folded)\n  - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (folded)\n  - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (folded)\n\nActions this hand:\n- preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 32 (me posting small blind)\n- preflop: Seat 2 post_bb 64 (big blind)\n- preflop: Seat 3 fold\n\nAmount to call: 32 (I need to put in 32 more to complete the big blind)\nMinimum raise to: 128\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nWait, let me re-read the \"Amount to call: 32\". I posted 32 as small blind, big blind is 64, so I need to call 32 more to match the big blind.\n\nMy hand: J3 offsuit. This is a very weak hand, especially with a short stack of 6.5 BB.\n\nLet me think about the key factors:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: J3o is terrible. It's not connected, not suited, and the Jack is weak. This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Stack size**: I have 417 chips, which is 6.5 BB. This is a short stack but not desperate yet. In tournament poker, with 6.5 BB, I need to be very selective about which hands I play. I should be looking for spots to shove all-in or fold, not call raises.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position postflop. However, with such a short stack and a weak hand, position advantage is minimal.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 96 chips (32 + 64), and I need to call 32 more. That's 3:1 pot odds (96:32). But this is irrelevant with such a weak hand and short stack.\n\n5. **Opponent**: The big blind has 302 chips (4.7 BB), also a short stack. If I raise, they might shove. If I call, I'm out of position postflop (wait, I'm on the button, so I would be in position postflop). Actually, if I just call the 32, I would see the flop in position with 385 chips left (6 BB).\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 6.5 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. J3o is not a hand I want to invest chips in. The risk of losing more chips far outweighs the potential reward.\n\n7. **ICM considerations**: Not relevant here as it's early in the tournament and no immediate bubble considerations.\n\n8. **Opponent tendencies**: I should recall information about this opponent. The opponent is \"Kimi-K2\" in the big blind. Let me search for recall information about this opponent.\n\nActually, let me think about whether I should even use the recall tool. The hand is very straightforward - I have a terrible hand and a short stack. The correct play is clearly to fold. I don't need opponent history to know that J3o is not worth playing with 6.5 BB.\n\nBut let me consider if there's any argument for calling or raising:\n- **Calling 32**: I'd be investing 32 chips to see a flop with J3o. Even if I hit a Jack, I'm often dominated by better Jacks. If I hit a 3, it's unlikely to be good. The pot would be 128 chips, and I'd have 385 left. Not worth it.\n- **Raising**: Minimum raise is to 128. If I raise to 128, I'm investing 96 more chips. With a weak hand, this is spewing chips. I could also consider shoving all-in for 417, but that's a terrible idea with J3o.\n\nThe clear, obvious, correct decision is to **fold**.\n\nWait, let me double-check the situation. I posted the small blind of 32. The big blind posted 64. The action came to me after Seat 3 folded. I need to put in 32 more to call. \n\nWith"

I need to be very selective with my hands at this stack depth.\n\nLooking at my recent hand history, I've been folding a lot in the last few hands (hands 98-101), which is consistent with my overall very tight play (77 folds out of 101 hands, only 23% win rate).\n\nLooking at Seat 2's actions, I can see they've been raising frequently preflop (hands 90, 94, 96, 99, 100) with amounts ranging from 222 to 318. This suggests an aggressive player who likes to steal blinds.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I'm on the Button, the best position\n- I have Qs 6c - a very weak hand, offsuit and not connected\n- My stack is 417 chips (6.5 BB) - very short\n- Pot is 96 chips\n- I need to call 64 chips\n- The small blind (Seat 2) and big blind (Seat 3) are the only players left\n\nWith a 6.5 BB stack, I should be looking for spots to shove all-in with decent hands. However, Q6o is a terrible hand even for a shove. \n\nThe pot odds are 96:64 or 1.5:1, which means I need ~40% equity to call. Q6o typically has much less equity against any reasonable range.\n\nGiven my short stack, I should preserve my chips for a better spot. Q6o is simply not strong enough to call or raise here, even with position.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better hand or situation.",

I'm extremely short stacked (5.5 BB)\n2. I have a pocket pair on the button\n3. The opponent is tight but just raised big from SB\n4. This is likely a shove or fold decision\n\nWith pocket 5s and 5.5 BB, against a tight player who just raised from SB, this is a marginal spot. The opponent's raise sizing suggests strength. However, with such a short stack and a pocket pair, I should probably shove here. The opponent might be raising with a wide range given the short stack dynamics.\n\nWait, let me reconsider - the opponent only has 32 chips total and raised to 208. That's not possible. Let me re-read...\n\nActually, looking at the players:\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 32 chips\n- They posted SB of 32 (all their chips)\n- Then they raised to 208... but they only have 32 chips?\n\nThis seems like the raise is to 208 total, but they only have 32 chips, so the raise would actually be all-in for 32. Let me think about this differently.\n\nIf they have 32 chips and posted 32 as SB, they have 0 chips left. But the action says they raised to 208. This is confusing.\n\nActually, re-reading: \"Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 32 chips\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32\". So they posted their entire stack as the small blind, then raised to 208? That doesn't make sense.\n \nI'm facing a critical decision with pocket 5s and an extremely short stack. The opponent's raise is puzzling, but my tournament life is on the line. With only 5.5 BB, I need to make a bold move. The pot odds are tempting, and my position on the button gives me some advantage. I'll calculate my potential equity and consider the tight opponent's range. A shove might be my best chance to double up and stay alive in the tournament.\n\nThe key factors are my low chip count, decent hand, and the potential to force a difficult decision on the small blind. I'll need to weigh the risks carefully before committing my entire stack.\n\nIf the small blind has already committed their 32 chips, they're effectively all-in. This means my call of 144 chips could significantly impact my remaining stack of 209 chips. The pot size of 272 chips makes this a critical decision point in the tournament.\n\nI need to carefully consider the potential outcomes. Calling would leave me with 209 chips, but I'd want to understand the exact implications of the small blind's previous action and how it affects the current betting round.\n\nThe tight player's range and my current short stack create a complex strategic scenario. My pocket pair of 5s offers some potential, but the risk-reward calculation is tight. With limited information, I'm leaning towards a cautious fold to preserve my remaining chips.\n\nThe opponent's raise represents significant strength, and my pot odds aren't compelling enough to justify calling with a marginal hand. Even on the button, 5.5 BB doesn't give me much flexibility. Folding seems the most prudent move to maintain my tournament life.\n\nI'm tracking the opponent's pattern: they've shown strength with previous"

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**My hand:** 5c 5h (pocket fives)\n**Position:** Button\n**Stack:** 353 chips (5.5 BB)\n**Blinds:** 32/64\n**Pot:** 272 chips\n**Action:** Seat 3 (SB) posted 32, then raised to 208\n**Amount to call:** 144 chips\n**Legal actions:** fold, call, raise\n\nWait, I need to reconsider the chip counts. It says Seat 3 has 32 chips and posted SB of 32. If they posted 32 as SB, they'd have 0 left. But then they raised to 208. This seems inconsistent.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Perhaps the \"32 chips\" is their stack AFTER posting the SB? No, that doesn't make sense either.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: \"Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 32 chips\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 32\". This suggests they have 32 chips total and posted 32 as SB. Then the raise to 208 must be an error in the data, OR it means they're raising to 208 total which would be all their chips (32) plus something else? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me reconsider: perhaps the \"32 chips\" shown is their stack size at the start of the hand, they posted SB of 32 (leaving them with 0), and the raise to 208 is actually what they're raising TO, but they can only put in 32 total. So effectively they're all-in for 32.\n\nBut the amount to call is shown as 144. If the SB posted 32 and then raised to 208, that means they're raising 176 more (208-32 = 176). But they only have 32 chips. This is confusing.\n\nLet me try another interpretation: The \"32 chips\" shown for Seat 3 might be incorrect or outdated. If they raised to 208, they must have at least 208 chips. The amount to call is 144, which is 208 - 64 (my BB). \n\nActually, I should just focus on the key facts:\n\n\nI'm facing a critical decision with a short stack and pocket fives. The pot is substantial at 272 chips, but calling 144 chips represents a significant portion of my remaining 353-chip stack. With a tight opponent raising from the small blind, this becomes a high-risk, marginal spot. The hand history suggests my opponent plays conservatively, making their raise more meaningful. Given my limited stack and the unfavorable pot odds, folding appears to be the most prudent decision to preserve my tournament life.\n\nThe tight player's range likely includes higher pairs and strong aces, which puts my pocket fives at a distinct disadvantage. With only 5.5 big blinds remaining, I need to be extremely selective about my confrontations. The potential risk outweighs the potential reward in this scenario.\n\nMy stack size suggests a shove or fold strategy, and calling with a marginal hand like pocket fives doesn't align with optimal short-stack play. The pot odds are not compelling enough to justify risking a significant portion of my remaining chips.\n\nI need to preserve my limited stack for a more favorable opportunity, making a fold the most prudent decision in this situation.",

I should be looking for spots to either go all-in or fold. Ace-Jack suited is definitely strong enough to play with this stack size.\n\nOptions:\n- **Fold**: Too weak for AJs with 5BB on the button\n- **Call**: I could just call 32, but that would leave me with 289 chips (4.5 BB) and I'd be out of position post-flop against the BB\n- **Raise**: With 5BB, the standard play is to shove all-in. This gives me fold equity and maximizes my chances to double up.\n\nLet me think about the opponent in BB (Seat 2) with 214 chips (3.3 BB). They're also short-stacked. They might call with a wide range including any pair, any Ace, any King, any Queen, and some suited connectors.\n\nWith AJs, I have about 60% equity against a random hand, and even against a calling range like 22+, A2s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KJo+, I still have decent equity.\n\nSince the minimum raise is 128 and I have 321, and this is a tournament with 5BB, the correct play is to shove all-in for 321 chips. This maximizes fold equity and gives me the best chance to accumulate chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - the minimum raise is 128, but with 321 chips (5BB), I should either fold or go all-in. A standard raise to 128 would leave me with 193 chips (3BB) and committed to the pot anyway. Better to shove.\n\nThe action should be: raise to 321 (all-in).",

Let me re-read:\n\n\"Blinds: 32/64\" - So small blind is 32, big blind is 64.\n\n\"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - 11 chips is way less than 1 big blind (64 chips). This means we're extremely short-stacked.\n\nBut then it says \"Pot: 224 chips\" - how can the pot be 224 chips if the blinds are 32/64 and we're the BB with only 11 chips?\n\nLet me trace the actions:\n- Seat 3 (SB) posts 32\n- Seat 1 (BB, us) posts 64 - but we only have 11 chips. This is impossible.\n\nWait, the user says \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - 11 chips is 0.2 of a 64-chip big blind, so 0.2 * 64 = 12.8, close to 11. So yes, we have 11 chips total.\n\nBut then \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 64\" - we cannot post 64 chips if we only have 11 chips. This is contradictory.\n\nLet me re-read more carefully: \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - maybe the BB is 64, but we have 11 chips left AFTER posting? Or maybe the tournament uses different blind structure?\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. Maybe the \"11 chips\" is a typo or the blinds are in a different unit. Let me look at the pot size: \"Pot: 224 chips\"\n\nIf blinds are 32/64:\n- SB posts 32\n- BB posts 64\nTotal from blinds = 96 chips\n\nBut the pot is 224 chips, which is much larger. Then \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 128\" - so someone raised to 128.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n- SB posts 32\n- BB posts 64\n- Seat 2 raises to 128 (this is a raise of 64 over the BB of 64)\n\nIf everyone calls, the pot would be:\n- SB: 32\n- BB: 64\n- Seat 2: 128\nTotal: 224 chips\n\nAh! So \"Pot: 224 chips\" is the current pot size AFTER the raise to 128 and before any action from us.\n\nNow, \"Amount to call: 64\" - we posted 64 as BB, and someone raised to 128, so we need to put in 64 more to call.\n\nBut wait: \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - we only have 11 chips total. We cannot call 64 chips.\n\nThis is extremely contradictory. Let me think about what could be happening:\n\n1. Maybe the \"11 chips\" is a mistake and we actually have more\n2. Maybe the \"0.2 BB\" is a mistake and we have more chips\n3. Maybe the blind structure is different than I think\n4. Maybe this is a tournament where the BB is 5 chips or something, making 11 chips = 0.2 BB\n\nLet me look at the numbers again:\n- If BB is 64, then 0.2 BB = 0.2 * 64 = 12.8 chips\n- If we have 11 chips, that's roughly 0.17 BB\n\nBut the user explicitly says \"Blinds: 32/64\" and \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\".\n\nWait, maybe the \"(0.2 BB)\" is a calculation error by the system, and we actually have more chips"

Let me re-examine the situation carefully:\n\n- My position: BB (Seat 1)\n- My cards: Qd Jd (suited, decent hand)\n- My stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB) - this is extremely short\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 224 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call (no raise option listed)\n- Amount to call: 64 chips\n\nWait, there's a critical issue here: I only have 11 chips total, but I need to call 64 chips. This means I cannot possibly call - I can only fold or go all-in for my remaining 11 chips if that's an option.\n\nBut the user says \"Legal actions: fold, call\" - no raise/all-in option is listed. However, in poker, if you don't have enough to call, you can go all-in for whatever you have left.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The \"Amount to call: 64\" might be a display error, or it might mean I need to put in 64 more chips total (but I only have 11). In reality, if I only have 11 chips, I can go all-in for 11.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: 224 chips. This suggests:\n- SB posted 32\n- BB posted 64\n- Seat 2 raised to 128\n- Total: 32 + 64 + 128 = 224\n\nSo the action is on me in the BB. I posted 64, and Seat 2 raised to 128. I need to call 64 more chips to see the flop.\n\nBut I only have 11 chips left after posting the BB? Wait, that doesn't make sense either. If I had to post BB of 64, I must have had at least 64 chips to start the hand.\n\nLet me re-read: \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - maybe this means I have 11 big blinds, not 11 chips? No, it says \"11 chips\" and then \"(0.2 BB)\" as a conversion.\n\nI think there might be an error in the hand description. However, I must make a decision based on what's given. Let me assume the key facts are:\n1. I have a very short stack (0.2 BB = very short)\n2. I have Qd Jd in the BB\n3. Someone raised to 128\n4. I need to call 64 more\n5. I only have legal actions: fold, call\n\nGiven that I have Qd Jd, this is a decent hand, especially when short-stacked. From the BB, this is definitely a hand I should play, especially if I can see a flop cheaply relative to my stack.\n\nBut wait - if I truly only have 11 chips and need to call 64, that's impossible. The system must be allowing me to call for my remaining 11 chips (all-in).\n\nLet me think about the tournament situation:\n- I'm extremely short-stacked (0.2 BB)\n- Qd Jd is a strong hand in this spot\n- The pot is already 224 chips\n- If I win, I quadruple up or more\n- Tournament survival is important, but with 0.2 BB, I need to make a move soon\n\nWith Qd Jd, I should definitely go all-in here. It's a premium hand for a short stack, and I have good equity against most ranges.\n\nHowever, the user says \"Legal actions: fold, call\" - no raise option. But if I only have 11 chips and need to call 64, my only realistic option is to go all-in for 11, which should be treated as a call of 11.\n\nLet me make a decision: I should go all-in with Qd Jd here. It's a strong hand, I'm extremely short-stacked, and I need to accumulate chips or go home.\n\nThe reasoning should be: I have a suited connector QJ with good playability, I'm extremely short-stacked at 0.2 BB, and this is a good spot to shove and try to double/triple up.\n\nBut the format requires me to choose from fold, call, or raise. Since raise isn't listed as a legal action, but I need to put in all my chips, I think \"call\" is the appropriate action here (calling for my remaining stack).\n\nActually, let me reconsider: if the amount to call is 64 and I only have 11, I cannot call 64. In poker rules, I would be all-in for 11. The system should allow this as a \"call\" action that puts me all-in.\n\nSo my decision is: call (all-in for my remaining 11 chips).\n\nReasoning: With Qd Jd and only 0.2 BB left, this is"

So \"Pot: 224 chips\" is the current pot size AFTER the raise to 128 and before any action from us.\n\nNow, \"Amount to call: 64\" - we posted 64 as BB, and someone raised to 128, so we need to put in 64 more to call.\n\nBut wait: \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - we only have 11 chips total. We cannot call 64 chips.\n\nThis is extremely contradictory. Let me think about what could be happening:\n\n1. Maybe the \"11 chips\" is a mistake and we actually have more\n2. Maybe the \"0.2 BB\" is a mistake and we have more chips\n3. Maybe the blind structure is different than I think\n4. Maybe this is a tournament where the BB is 5 chips or something, making 11 chips = 0.2 BB\n\nLet me look at the numbers again:\n- If BB is 64, then 0.2 BB = 0.2 * 64 = 12.8 chips\n- If we have 11 chips, that's roughly 0.17 BB\n\nBut the user explicitly says \"Blinds: 32/64\" and \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\".\n\nWait, maybe the \"(0.2 BB)\" is a calculation error by the system, and we actually have more chips",

Let me re-examine the situation carefully:\n\n- My position: BB (Seat 1)\n- My cards: Qd Jd (suited, decent hand)\n- My stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB) - this is extremely short\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 224 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call (no raise option listed)\n- Amount to call: 64 chips\n\nWait, there's a critical issue here: I only have 11 chips total, but I need to call 64 chips. This means I cannot possibly call - I can only fold or go all-in for my remaining 11 chips if that's an option.\n\nBut the user says \"Legal actions: fold, call\" - no raise/all-in option is listed. However, in poker, if you don't have enough to call, you can go all-in for whatever you have left.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The \"Amount to call: 64\" might be a display error, or it might mean I need to put in 64 more chips total (but I only have 11). In reality, if I only have 11 chips, I can go all-in for 11.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: 224 chips. This suggests:\n- SB posted 32\n- BB posted 64\n- Seat 2 raised to 128\n- Total: 32 + 64 + 128 = 224\n\nSo the action is on me in the BB. I posted 64, and Seat 2 raised to 128. I need to call 64 more chips to see the flop.\n\nBut I only have 11 chips left after posting the BB? Wait, that doesn't make sense either. If I had to post BB of 64, I must have had at least 64 chips to start the hand.\n\nLet me re-read: \"Your Stack: 11 chips (0.2 BB)\" - maybe this means I have 11 big blinds, not 11 chips? No, it says \"11 chips\" and then \"(0.2 BB)\" as a conversion.\n\nI think there might be an error in the hand description. However, I must make a decision based on what's given. Let me assume the key facts are:\n1. I have a very short stack (0.2 BB = very short)\n2. I have Qd Jd in the BB\n3. Someone raised to 128\n4. I need to call 64 more\n5. I only have legal actions: fold, call\n\nGiven that I have Qd Jd, this is a decent hand, especially when short-stacked. From the BB, this is definitely a hand I should play, especially if I can see a flop cheaply relative to my stack.\n\nBut wait - if I truly only have 11 chips and need to call 64, that's impossible. The system must be allowing me to call for my remaining 11 chips (all-in).\n\nLet me think about the tournament situation:\n- I'm extremely short-stacked (0.2 BB)\n- Qd Jd is a strong hand in this spot\n- The pot is already 224 chips\n- If I win, I quadruple up or more\n- Tournament survival is important, but with 0.2 BB, I need to make a move soon\n\nWith Qd Jd, I should definitely go all-in here. It's a premium hand for a short stack, and I have good equity against most ranges.\n\nHowever, the user says \"Legal actions: fold, call\" - no raise option. But if I only have 11 chips and need to call 64, my only realistic option is to go all-in for 11, which should be treated as a call of 11.\n\nLet me make a decision: I should go all-in with Qd Jd here. It's a strong hand, I'm extremely short-stacked, and I need to accumulate chips or go home.\n\nThe reasoning should be: I have a suited connector QJ with good playability, I'm extremely short-stacked at 0.2 BB, and this is a good spot to shove and try to double/triple up.\n\nBut the format requires me to choose from fold, call, or raise. Since raise isn't listed as a legal action, but I need to put in all my chips, I think \"call\" is the appropriate action here (calling for my remaining stack).\n\nActually, let me reconsider: if the amount to call is 64 and I only have 11, I cannot call 64. In poker rules, I would be all-in for 11. The system should allow this as a \"call\" action that puts me all-in.\n\nSo my decision is: call (all-in for my remaining 11 chips).\n\nReasoning: With Qd Jd and only 0.2 BB left, this is",

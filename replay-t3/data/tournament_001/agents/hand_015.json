Only raised once in hand #7. This suggests a very tight player who likely has a strong hand when they enter the pot.\n\n2. **Seat 3 (BB - DeepSeek-V3.2)**: This opponent has been more active. They've folded several times but also:\n   - Called a raise in hand #11\n   - Checked then raised on the flop in hand #11 (showing aggression)\n   - Raised preflop in hand #13 and bet the flop\n\n3. **My own play**: I've been very tight, playing only 2 out of 14 hands (14% win rate, but that's misleading since it's win rate not VPIP). Actually looking at my hands, I've folded most of the time and only played hands #11 and #10 where I raised with J9s on the button.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with QTo (offsuit)\n- Everyone folded to me\n- I need to call 1 chip to see the flop (pot is 3, I posted 1 as SB)\n- The SB (tight player) and BB (more aggressive player) are the only ones left\n\n**Analysis:**\n- QTo offsuit is a marginal hand, but I'm in the best position (BTN)\n- The SB is very tight (folds 90% of the time preflop), so if I raise, they might fold often\n- The BB is more aggressive and might defend their blind\n- Pot odds: I need to call 1 to win 3 (3:1 odds), which is good\n- With my deep stack (366 chips), I can afford to see a flop\n\n**Decision:** I should raise. Here's why:\n1. I'm in position on the BTN\n2. QTo is strong enough to raise against two players, especially when the SB is very tight\n3. I can likely take down the pot preflop or have position postflop\n4. A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 6 chips total (raising to 6)\n \nI'll make a strategic raise to 6 chips, leveraging my position and the tight nature of the small blind. This move puts pressure on opponents and allows me to control the action postflop.",

I have 256 chips (128 BB), so I have a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, 366 chips): Has been folding a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop). Shows some aggression when they do play (raised to 8 in hand 11, bet 10 on flop).\n2. Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, 178 chips): Has folded a lot too (last 4 hands folded preflop). Showed one raise to 6 in hand 7.\n3. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, 49 chips): Short stack (24.5 BB). Has shown some aggression - raised to 4 in hand 14, and was involved in a big hand (hand 9) with multiple raises.\n4. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, 147 chips): Mostly folds preflop, raised to 8 once in hand 12, called 4 in hand 13.\n\nAs UTG with J5o, this is an easy fold. The hand has very little potential - no connectivity, no suitedness, and Jack-high is weak. From early position, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand against players who haven't acted yet. There are 4 players left to act behind me who could raise.\n\nEven though it's only 2 chips to call (1 BB), calling with J5o from UTG is terrible poker. I'd be putting money in with a hand that will rarely hit a flop well and will be difficult to play postflop out of position.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for a better spot. With 128 BB, I'm not desperate for chips. I should be playing tight from early position.\n\nGiven the tournament context, I want to avoid marginal spots with weak hands. Fold and wait for a better opportunity."

I have 256 chips (128 BB), so I have a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, 366 chips): Has been folding a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop). Shows some aggression when they do play (raised to 8 in hand 11, bet 10 on flop).\n2. Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, 178 chips): Has folded a lot too (last 4 hands folded preflop). Showed one raise to 6 in hand 7.\n3. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, 49 chips): Short stack (24.5 BB). Has shown some aggression - raised to 4 in hand 14, and was involved in a big hand (hand 9) with multiple raises.\n4. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, 147 chips): Mostly folds preflop, raised to 8 once in hand 12, called 4 in hand 13.\n\nAs UTG with J5o, this is an easy fold. The hand has very little potential - no connectivity, no suitedness, and Jack-high is weak. From early position, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand against players who haven't acted yet. There are 4 players left to act behind me who could raise.\n\nEven though it's only 2 chips to call (1 BB), calling with J5o from UTG is terrible poker. I'd be putting money in with a hand that will rarely hit a flop well and will be difficult to play postflop out of position.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for a better spot. With 128 BB, I'm not desperate for chips. I should be playing tight from early position.\n\nGiven the tournament context, I want to avoid marginal spots with weak hands. Fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

J5o is a very weak hand, especially from UTG (early position). In poker, you should play tight from early positions. With 128 BB stack, not desperate. Better to fold and wait for a better spot. Calling or raising would be bad.\n\nThus, action should be \"fold\". raise_to null. Reasoning: \"J5o is too weak from UTG.

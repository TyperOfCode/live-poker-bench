            "content": "  I need to analyze this situation carefully. Let me break down the key information:\n\n**My Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - Seat 1\n- Cards: 6s 8s (suited connectors, 6 and 8 of spades)\n- Stack: 369 chips (23.1 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (SB) - 298 chips\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB) - 292 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) - SB:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 60: Preflop raise to 24 (1.5x BB)\n- Hand 61: Preflop fold\n- Hand 62: Preflop call 47 (facing a raise)\n- Hand 63: Preflop call 8 (just completed SB), then flop check and fold\n- Hands 64-67: Preflop folds (4 consecutive folds)\n- Hand 68: No data shown but likely fold\n\nShowdowns:\n- Hand 30: Showdown with Tc 7d (weak hand)\n- Hand 57: Showdown with 4d 4s (pocket pair)\n- Hand 62: Showdown with 5s Kc (King high)\n\n**Pattern:** Seems to be playing relatively tight. Raises occasionally but folds frequently. Has shown down with weak hands like T7o and K5o. Not particularly aggressive.\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) - BB:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 63: Flop check and fold (after defending BB)\n- Hand 64: Preflop call 8, then check-check-check through river (very passive)\n- Hand 65: Preflop raise to 48 (3x BB - significant aggression)\n- Hands 66-68: Preflop folds (3 consecutive folds)\n\nShowdown:\n- Hand 64: Showdown with 2s Ts (weak hand)\n\n**Pattern:** Generally passive, but occasionally makes large preflop raises (like Hand 65: 48 chips). Defends BB sometimes but plays passively postflop. Has folded to pressure.\n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\n\n1. **My Hand:** 6s 8s is a suited connector. This hand plays well in position, can make straights and flushes, and benefits from seeing flops cheaply. On the button, this is a good spot to see a flop.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the button - the best position. I will act last on every street postflop.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes:** \n   - I have 23.1 BB (369 chips)\n   - SB has 18.6 BB (298 chips)\n   - BB has 18.25 BB (292 chips)\n   - We're all in similar stack territory - not super deep but not desperate yet.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** \n   - Pot is 24, I need to call 16\n   - Getting 1.5:1 immediate pot odds\n   - But implied odds are more important with a suited connector\n\n5. **Opponent Tendencies:**\n   - Both opponents have been folding frequently (4+ consecutive folds for SB, 3+ for BB)\n   - BB occasionally makes large preflop raises (up to 48 chips)\n   - Both play passively postflop\n   - Neither seems particularly strong or aggressive overall\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:**\n   - Blinds are 8/16, so they're meaningful but not critical\n   - My stack is healthy at 23 BB\n   - Losing 16 chips wouldn't hurt much\n   - Winning chips would help build stack\n\n**Decision Options:**\n\n1. **Fold:** Too tight. 6s 8s on the button is a perfectly playable hand, especially against opponents who have been folding a lot.\n\n2. **Call:** The standard play. I get to see a flop in position with a hand that can make strong disguised hands (straights, flushes). The cost is reasonable (16 chips).\n\n3. **Raise:** \n   - Minimum raise to 32 (2x BB)\n   - Could potentially take down the pot immediately\n   - But risks more chips with a marginal hand\n   - SB and BB have shown they can fold to raises\n\n**My Recommendation:**\n\nI think **calling** is the best play here. Here's why:\n\n- **Hand Strength:** 6s 8s is not strong enough to raise for value, but it's too good to fold on the button\n- **Position:** Being on the button is crucial - I'll see how both opponents act before I make any postflop decisions\n- **Pot Control:** Calling keeps the pot"

I should call and see a flop in position.\n\nI could also consider raising, but with 6s8s I'd rather just call and see a flop. A re-raise would be too aggressive with this hand.\n\nDecision: Call 32",

            "content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 6s 8s (6-8 suited spades)\n**Board**: 6c 6d Qs\n**Position**: BTN (Button)\n**Stack**: 321 chips (20.1 BB)\n**Pot**: 192 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis**:\nI have trip sixes (6-6-6) with a Queen on board. This is a very strong hand - I have trips with an 8 kicker. The only hands that beat me are:\n- Pocket Queens (full house)\n- 6-X (where X > 8, giving me a lower kicker)\n- A higher pocket pair that makes a full house\n\n**Action Analysis**:\n- Preflop: Opponent raised from SB to 48, I called with 6s 8s\n- Flop: Opponent bets 80 into a pot of 112 (preflop: 16+48+48 = 112)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2)**:\nLooking at the recall data:\n- This opponent is relatively passive post-flop (lots of checking and folding)\n- They've shown down with weak hands like 4-4, 5-K, T-7\n- They raised preflop in hand 56, 60 (small raises)\n- They've folded to pressure multiple times\n- In hand 62, they called preflop and ended up with K-5 on a Q-4-2-6-Q board (two pair on river)\n\nThe current bet of 80 seems strong - it's about 72% of the pot. Given the board texture (paired board with a Queen), this could be:\n- A Queen (top pair)\n- A pocket pair (trying to protect against draws)\n- A 6 (trip sixes with better kicker)\n- Air (bluff)\n\n**Pot Odds**:\nI need to call 80 to win 192, which gives me 2.4:1 pot odds. I need about 29.4% equity to call.\n\n**Stack Considerations**:\n- I have 321 chips left (20.1 BB)\n- If I call, pot becomes 272 and I have 241 left\n- If I raise to 160 (minimum), I'm committing about half my stack\n\n**My Position**:\nI'm on the button, which is favorable. I have position post-flop.\n\n**Decision**:\nI have trips, which is a very strong hand. Given that my opponent has shown tendencies to be passive and fold to pressure, and given that I have a strong hand with position, I should raise here to:\n1. Get value from weaker hands (Queens, pocket pairs)\n2. Protect against draws (though there aren't many on this board)\n3. Put pressure on the opponent\n\nHowever, I need to consider that if they have a Queen, they might call. If they have a 6 with a better kicker, I'm in trouble. But given their passive nature, they might be betting a Queen or weaker hand.\n\nLooking at their showdown history, they play relatively weak hands. The 80 bet could be a protection bet with a Queen or medium pocket pair.\n\nI think raising is the best play. I can raise to 160 (minimum) or go all-in. Given my stack size and the pot size, a raise to 160 seems reasonable - it applies pressure but doesn't commit my entire stack yet.\n\nLet me reconsider - the pot is 192, they're betting 80. If I raise to 160, I'm giving them 2:1 odds to call. They might call with a Queen. If I go all-in for 321, I'm giving them about 1.6:1 odds.\n\nActually, with trips on a relatively dry board, I should be looking to get value. The opponent's bet of 80 suggests they have something. I should raise for value. Given my stack size and the pot size, I can raise to 200-240 to really put pressure on.\n\nBut wait - the minimum raise is 160. Let me think about the sizing:\n- Call 80: Pot becomes 272, I have 241 left\n- Raise to 160: Total investment 160, pot becomes 352 if they call, I have 161 left\n\nActually, if I raise to 160, that's only adding 80 more to their 80 bet, which is essentially a min-raise. That might not achieve much.\n\nGiven I have trips and position, and given the opponent's passive tendencies, I should raise bigger to:\n1. Get maximum value from hands like Qx\n2. Charge them heavily if they're drawing\n3. Potentially take down the pot now if they're weak\n\nWith 321 stack and 192 pot, I could go all-in here. That would be a strong play with trips, and it maximizes pressure on a passive opponent.\n\nLet"

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 6s 8s (6-8 suited spades)\n**Board**: 6c 6d Qs\n**Position**: BTN (Button)\n**Stack**: 321 chips (20.1 BB)\n**Pot**: 192 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis**:\nI have trip sixes (6-6-6) with a Queen on board. This is a very strong hand - I have trips with an 8 kicker. The only hands that beat me are:\n- Pocket Queens (full house)\n- 6-X (where X > 8, giving me a lower kicker)\n- A higher pocket pair that makes a full house\n\n**Action Analysis**:\n- Preflop: Opponent raised from SB to 48, I called with 6s 8s\n- Flop: Opponent bets 80 into a pot of 112 (preflop: 16+48+48 = 112)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2)**:\nLooking at the recall data:\n- This opponent is relatively passive post-flop (lots of checking and folding)\n- They've shown down with weak hands like 4-4, 5-K, T-7\n- They raised preflop in hand 56, 60 (small raises)\n- They've folded to pressure multiple times\n- In hand 62, they called preflop and ended up with K-5 on a Q-4-2-6-Q board (two pair on river)\n\nThe current bet of 80 seems strong - it's about 72% of the pot. Given the board texture (paired board with a Queen), this could be:\n- A Queen (top pair)\n- A pocket pair (trying to protect against draws)\n- A 6 (trip sixes with better kicker)\n- Air (bluff)\n\n**Pot Odds**:\nI need to call 80 to win 192, which gives me 2.4:1 pot odds. I need about 29.4% equity to call.\n\n**Stack Considerations**:\n- I have 321 chips left (20.1 BB)\n- If I call, pot becomes 272 and I have 241 left\n- If I raise to 160 (minimum), I'm committing about half my stack\n\n**My Position**:\nI'm on the button, which is favorable. I have position post-flop.\n\n**Decision**:\nI have trips, which is a very strong hand. Given that my opponent has shown tendencies to be passive and fold to pressure, and given that I have a strong hand with position, I should raise here to:\n1. Get value from weaker hands (Queens, pocket pairs)\n2. Protect against draws (though there aren't many on this board)\n3. Put pressure on the opponent\n\nHowever, I need to consider that if they have a Queen, they might call. If they have a 6 with a better kicker, I'm in trouble. But given their passive nature, they might be betting a Queen or weaker hand.\n\nLooking at their showdown history, they play relatively weak hands. The 80 bet could be a protection bet with a Queen or medium pocket pair.\n\nI think raising is the best play. I can raise to 160 (minimum) or go all-in. Given my stack size and the pot size, a raise to 160 seems reasonable - it applies pressure but doesn't commit my entire stack yet.\n\nLet me reconsider - the pot is 192, they're betting 80. If I raise to 160, I'm giving them 2:1 odds to call. They might call with a Queen. If I go all-in for 321, I'm giving them about 1.6:1 odds.\n\nActually, with trips on a relatively dry board, I should be looking to get value. The opponent's bet of 80 suggests they have something. I should raise for value. Given my stack size and the pot size, I can raise to 200-240 to really put pressure on.\n\nBut wait - the minimum raise is 160. Let me think about the sizing:\n- Call 80: Pot becomes 272, I have 241 left\n- Raise to 160: Total investment 160, pot becomes 352 if they call, I have 161 left\n\nActually, if I raise to 160, that's only adding 80 more to their 80 bet, which is essentially a min-raise. That might not achieve much.\n\nGiven I have trips and position, and given the opponent's passive tendencies, I should raise bigger to:\n1. Get maximum value from hands like Qx\n2. Charge them heavily if they're drawing\n3. Potentially take down the pot now if they're weak\n\nWith 321 stack and 192 pot, I could go all-in here.

            "reasoning_content": "  The user wants me to respond with a JSON object containing my action decision. Let me analyze the situation carefully:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: 6s 8s (trip sixes with 8 kicker)\n- Board: 6c 6d Qs\n- Position: BTN (button)\n- Stack: 321 chips (20.1 BB)\n- Pot: 192 chips\n- Opponent bet on flop: 80\n- Amount to call: 80\n- Minimum raise: 160\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have trip sixes (6-6-6-8-Q). This is a very strong hand, only beaten by:\n   - Pocket Queens (full house Q-Q-6-6-6)\n   - 6-X where X > 8 (better kicker)\n   - Higher pocket pairs that make a full house\n\n2. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the recall data, Kimi-K2 is relatively passive:\n   - Check-folds frequently on flop\n   - Makes small raises preflop (24 chips)\n   - Folds to pressure\n   - Has shown down weak hands\n\n3. **Current Action**: They raised preflop to 48 (from SB) and now bet 80 on flop (72% pot size)\n   - This could be a protection bet with a Queen\n   - Could be a pocket pair\n   - Could be a bluff\n   - Could be trip sixes with better kicker\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: Calling 80 to win 192 = 2.4:1, need ~29.4% equity\n\n5. **Stack Considerations**: I have 321 left. If I call, pot = 272, I have 241 left. If I raise to 160, pot = 352 if called, I have 161 left.\n\n6. **Position**: I'm on button, which is excellent\n\n**Decision**: I have a very strong hand (trips) against a passive opponent who is betting. I should raise for value and protection. Given my stack size and the pot size, and considering the opponent's passive nature, I should make a substantial raise.\n\nThe minimum raise is 160. Given that the opponent bet 80, raising to 160 is just a min-raise, which might not achieve much. I could raise more. \n\nLooking at my stack of 321, I could:\n- Raise to 200-240 to put real pressure\n- Go all-in for 321\n\nGiven the opponent's passive tendencies and the strength of my hand, I think raising to 200-240 is appropriate. However, the minimum raise is 160, and I need to specify the total amount I'm putting in.\n\nLet me think about the sizing more carefully. If I raise to 200:\n- I'm adding 120 to their 80 bet\n- Pot becomes 192 + 200 = 392\n- I have 121 left\n\nThis seems like a good sizing - it's substantial enough to get value and apply pressure, but doesn't commit my entire stack.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With trips on a board that's not too draw-heavy, I want to get value from hands like Qx, pocket pairs, etc. The opponent's 80 bet suggests they have something. I should raise for value.\n\nGiven the pot is 192 and they bet 80, and I have 321 behind:\n- A raise to 200-240 seems appropriate\n- Going all-in for 321 is also an option, maximizing pressure\n\nI think I'll raise to 200. This is a solid raise that:\n1. Gets value from weaker hands\n2. Applies pressure to a passive opponent\n3. Doesn't overcommit my stack if they have me beat\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Looking at the opponent's preflop raise from SB to 48, then betting 80 on this flop - this shows strength. They could have:\n- A Queen (top pair)\n- Pocket pair (trying to protect)\n- A 6 with better kicker\n- Air (bluff)\n\nGiven I have trip sixes with an 8 kicker, I'm losing to:\n- Pocket Queens (full house)\n- A6, K6, Q6, J6, T6, 96 (all have better kickers)\n- 66 (quad sixes)\n\nBut given the opponent's passive history, would they really bet 80 with just a 6? They might, but it's less likely. More likely they have a Queen or pocket pair.\n\nI have a strong hand and position. I should raise. Let me go with a raise to 200.",

KTo is a marginal hand, especially out of position against a raiser. The small blind's raise after a limper could indicate strength.\n\nWithout opponent history, I should consider default strategy. KTo is borderline but can be played in some situations. However, I'm out of position against the raiser, which makes the hand harder to play postflop. The pot odds: I need to call 32 to win 80+32=112, so about 28.6% equity needed.\n\nKTo vs a typical SB raising range might have around 35-40% equity, so pot odds are favorable. But implied odds are poor because I'm out of position and my stack isn't deep (only 18BB effective).\n\nGiven the tournament situation and my marginal hand out of position, folding seems reasonable. However, let me check if there's any information about the opponent. Actually, I can't use tools because the system is complaining about format. I need to just make a decision.\n\nI think folding is the most prudent play. KTo is not strong enough to call a raise out of position with 18BB stack. I'll fold.",

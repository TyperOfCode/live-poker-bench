Seat 5 is GPT-OSS-120B. Looking at their preflop raises:\n- Hand 4: raised 12\n- Hand 5: raised 4  \n- Hand 12: raised 8\n- Hand 21: raised 8\n- Hand 34: raised 10\n\nThis is a massive raise to 111 chips! This is highly unusual based on their pattern. They typically raise small amounts (4-12 chips). This huge raise suggests either:\n1. A very strong hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK maybe)\n2. A complete bluff with a weak hand\n3. They're trying to bully with a medium hand\n\n**My hand analysis:**\nQc Kh is a strong hand, especially in BB:\n- It's offsuit but has two high cards\n- Dominated by AA, KK, QQ, AKs, AKo\n- Ahead of most other hands\n- Good tournament hand\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- I have 347 chips (86.8 BB)\n- Calling 107 would leave me with 240 chips\n- If I raise to 212 minimum, I'd have 135 left\n- If I fold, I preserve my stack\n\n**Opponent's massive raise:**\nThe raise to 111 is 27.75 BB! This is enormous. Given their pattern of small raises, this is either:\n1. AA/KK trying to get value\n2. A complete bluff trying to steal\n3. QQ/AK trying to avoid tough decisions\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in BB, so I'll be out of position postflop if I call.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- This is hand #37, we're still relatively early\n- Preserving stack is important but so is accumulating chips\n- Folding QK to a huge raise might be too tight\n- Calling leaves me pot-committed\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Pot odds:** Getting about 1.17:1, which is not great\n2. **Implied odds:** If I hit a Q or K, I could win a big pot\n3. **Reverse implied odds:** If I hit and they have AA/KK, I could lose big\n4. **Opponent's pattern:** They've never raised this big before\n5. **Stack preservation:** Folding keeps me at 86.8 BB\n\n**Analysis of opponent's possible hands:**\n- **Premium hands (AA, KK, QQ, AK):** Would make sense for this raise size\n- **Bluffs:** Possible but risky for them\n- **Medium pairs (JJ, TT, 99):** Might raise big to avoid tough decisions\n- **AQ, AJ:** Might raise big but less likely\n\n**My options:**\n1. **Fold:** Safe, preserves stack, but might be too tight against an unknown\n2. **Call:** 107 chips to see flop, leaves me with 240, pot would be 232\n3. **Raise:** Minimum 212, which would commit me\n\n**Recommendation:**\nGiven the opponent's unusual massive raise from their pattern, and the fact that I'm out of position with QK offsuit, I think this is a fold. The raise size is too suspicious and commits too many chips preflop with a hand that could be dominated.\n\nHowever, QK is a strong hand and folding might be too tight. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, thinking more carefully:\n- The pot is already 125 chips\n- I need to call 107\n- If I call, pot will be 232 and I'll have 240 left\n- I'll be essentially pot-committed\n\nIf I call and hit a Q or K on the flop, I could win a big pot. If I miss, I can check-fold.\n\nBut the opponent's massive raise is very concerning. They've never done this before in 36+ hands.\n\n**Final decision:** I think this is a marginal spot but given the opponent's unprecedented raise size and my position, I"

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (folded last 5 preflop decisions). Only one showdown shows KK (big pair). Seems tight.\n2. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Short stack (111 chips, ~28 BB). Has been folding a lot but showed one raise (hand 34) and one call (hand 36). Currently posted SB.\n\n**My Hand Evaluation:**\n7\u2665 8\u2663 is a speculative hand. As offsuit connectors, it has some potential to make straights but is otherwise weak. On the button with only the blinds to act, this is a reasonable stealing spot.\n\n**Position Advantage:** Being on the button gives me maximum postflop advantage. I can see how both opponents react before I act on later streets.\n\n**Stack Considerations:** \n- I have 70.5 BB, which is healthy.\n- Seat 5 is short (28 BB) and might be looking to defend/play hands.\n- Seat 1 has a big stack but seems tight.\n\n**Tournament Context:** \n- I have a decent stack, can afford to take some risks.\n- Button steals are profitable in tournament poker.\n- With only 3 players at the table (2 opponents), stealing becomes more valuable.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Fold: Safest play, but gives up a profitable stealing opportunity.\n2. Call: Not ideal with 78o - I want to either steal or fold. Calling invites the blinds to see a cheap flop.\n3. Raise: Standard button steal attempt. Should be around 2.5-3x BB.\n\n**Raise Sizing:** Minimum raise to 8 (2x BB) or slightly larger to 10-12 (2.5-3x BB). Since it's just the blinds, a small raise might work.\n\nGiven Seat 1's tight folding tendencies and Seat 5's short stack, a raise has good fold equity. Even if called, I have position.\n\nI'll raise to 10 chips (2.5x BB). This is enough to pressure the blinds while not risking too much."

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (folded last 5 preflop decisions). Only one showdown shows KK (big pair). Seems tight.\n2. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Short stack (111 chips, ~28 BB). Has been folding a lot but showed one raise (hand 34) and one call (hand 36). Currently posted SB.\n\n**My Hand Evaluation:**\n7\u2665 8\u2663 is a speculative hand. As offsuit connectors, it has some potential to make straights but is otherwise weak. On the button with only the blinds to act, this is a reasonable stealing spot.\n\n**Position Advantage:** Being on the button gives me maximum postflop advantage. I can see how both opponents react before I act on later streets.\n\n**Stack Considerations:** \n- I have 70.5 BB, which is healthy.\n- Seat 5 is short (28 BB) and might be looking to defend/play hands.\n- Seat 1 has a big stack but seems tight.\n\n**Tournament Context:** \n- I have a decent stack, can afford to take some risks.\n- Button steals are profitable in tournament poker.\n- With only 3 players at the table (2 opponents), stealing becomes more valuable.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Fold: Safest play, but gives up a profitable stealing opportunity.\n2. Call: Not ideal with 78o - I want to either steal or fold. Calling invites the blinds to see a cheap flop.\n3. Raise: Standard button steal attempt. Should be around 2.5-3x BB.\n\n**Raise Sizing:** Minimum raise to 8 (2x BB) or slightly larger to 10-12 (2.5-3x BB). Since it's just the blinds, a small raise might work.\n\nGiven Seat 1's tight folding tendencies and Seat 5's short stack, a raise has good fold equity. Even if called, I have position.\n\nI'll raise to 10 chips (2.5x BB). This is enough to pressure the blinds while not risking too much.",

My reasoning: button position, opponents seem tight/folding a lot, good fold equity, decent stack size. I want to raise to 10 chips (2.5x BB).\n\nSo my JSON response should be:\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 10,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Button steal attempt with position advantage.

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm on the button with 7h8c. I raised to 10, and the small blind (seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) has raised to 111 total (which is effectively all-in since they only have 2 chips left? Wait, they have 2 chips according to the stack display, but they raised to 111? That doesn't make sense. Let me check: seat 5 has 2 chips according to the player list, but they raised to 111. That seems like a mistake. Actually, looking at the action: \"Seat 5 raise 111\" after I raised to 10. The small blind already posted 2, so they're putting in 111 total, which is 101 more to me. But they only have 2 chips? Something is off.\n\nWait, maybe the stack display is wrong, or maybe seat 5 has more chips than shown. Let me re-read: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 2 chips\" but they raised to 111. That would require them to have at least 111 chips. This is confusing.\n\nLet me think about the pot: blinds 2/4, pot is 125 chips. That includes: SB 2, BB 4, my raise 10, SB's raise 111. That's 2+4+10+111 = 127, close to 125. Maybe there's rounding.\n\nRegardless, I have 78o on the button. I raised preflop, which is a bit loose but positionally okay. Now facing a massive re-raise. The opponent in seat 5 has been mostly folding preflop based on history, with one raise and one call recently. They have 2 chips left (if the display is accurate), so this is essentially an all-in situation.\n\nMy stack is 272 chips (68 BB). I need to call 101 to win a pot of 125+101 = 226? Actually, pot is 125 now, I need to call 101, so pot would be 226 if I call. That's pot odds of 101 to win 226, or about 1:2.2, meaning I need about 31% equity.\n\nWith 78o against a likely strong range from a short stack shove, I'm probably not getting 31% equity. Even against a tight range like {TT+, AK, AQ}, 78o has only about 24% equity. Against a wider range like {22+, A2s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KJo+, QJo}, it's about 32%. But given this opponent has been folding a lot and suddenly makes a huge raise, they likely have a strong hand.\n\nAlso, tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (68 BB), no need to gamble with 78o. Folding preserves my stack.\n\nThe BB folded, so it's just me against the SB. The SB has effectively shoved (if they only have 2 chips, this raise puts them all-in). Even if they have more chips, this is a huge raise relative to the pot.\n\nI should fold. The hand is too weak, the price isn't great, and I'm out of position postflop if I call (actually I'm button, SB is out of position, but still).\n\nLet me check if there's any other info. The opponent in seat 5 raised once before in hand 34 (to 10). That's the only raise I see. They called once in hand 36. Not much history.\n\nDecision: fold.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have SB with Js As (Ace-Jack suited). Stack 111 chips, blinds 2/4, effective stacks smallish. Opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 10 (so 2.5x big blind). We need to decide fold/call/raise. AJ suited is a strong hand, especially in short stack. Effective stack: opponent's stack unknown? Opponent seat 3 has 272 chips. Our stack 111, so we are short stack relative to them. We are in SB, so after posting 2, we face 8 to call, min raise to 16 (i.e., raise additional 6). Considering tournament, we have 27.8 BB, we can either call and see flop, or raise all-in? Our stack 111 chips, raise to 111 would be all-in. Minimum raise to 16 is small relative to our stack, but a raise might isolate. With AJ suited, we could raise to maybe 30-40 to apply pressure. However we are short stack; calling 8 leaves us 103 left, still decent. But if we call and lose, we lose 8, still have 103. Might be okay. However we have AJ suited, a premium hand. Raising could get more value if they have a weaker hand, but they already raised to 10, maybe they have a wide range. In SB, we can also consider re-raising all-in to leverage fold equity. Opponent's raise size 10 is small; they may be opening a wide range from UTG? Actually seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2, position unknown but likely UTG? Table seats: seat 1 is Kimi-K2 (BB), seat 2 folded, seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2, seat 5 is us (SB). So DeepSeek is UTG (or early). Their raise size is 10 (2.5 BB). That suggests a standard raise. With AJ suited, we can either call or 3-bet. Our stack 111, we could 3-bet to maybe 30-40 to isolate. But risk of being 4-bet all-in? Opponent could 4-bet all-in, but they have 272 chips, can cover us. However they might not 4-bet with weaker hands.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, we have 27.8 BB, not extremely short but can afford a push. AJ suited is a good hand to go all-in in short stack. Many players would push with AJ suited at 28 BB. So I think push all-in (raise to 111). Legal actions include raise; we can raise to our stack (all-in). Reasoning: maximize fold equity, avoid playing postflop with short stack, strong hand.\n\nThus action: raise to 111.",

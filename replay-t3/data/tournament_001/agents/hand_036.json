The pot is currently 18 (2 from SB, 4 from BB, 12 from raise). If I call, pot would be 28.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop in 3 out of 10 hands (hand 31, 35, and now 36). They raised to 12 each time. They've shown down Tc 7d in hand 30, so they're not playing premium hands only.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) in the BB has folded most hands, except one raise in hand 34. They have a short stack of 121 chips.\n\nMy hand Ts 3h is terrible - no suitedness, no connectivity, Ten-high with a weak kicker. I'm out of position (small blind) against a raiser. Even if I hit a Ten, I'm likely dominated. The pot odds are: need to call 10 to win 28, which is about 2.8:1 or 26% equity needed.\n\nWith Ts 3h, I probably have around 25-30% equity against a typical raising range, but being out of position makes it worse. Also, there's still the BB to act behind me, though they've been folding a lot.\n\nIn tournament poker, with 70.5 BB stack, I should avoid playing marginal hands out of position. This is an easy fold. No reason to waste chips with such a weak hand.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. I'm the small blind, so I already have 2 chips invested, but that's a sunk cost. Better to save the remaining 10 chips.",

Actually need 3-5-6-7-8? Not. So our hand is a pair of sixes, currently behind Q high. Opponent seat 2 raised preflop to 12 (3bb). We called. So they likely have a range: maybe broadway, suited connectors, etc. On flop they haven't acted yet (we are BB, they are in seat 2 UTG? Actually seat 2 is after seat1 folded, seat2 raised preflop. Now flop, it's seat2's turn first (since they were preflop raiser). The pot is 26 chips (2+4+12+8?). Let's compute: preflop: SB 2 (seat3), BB 4, raise to 12 (seat2) means they put 12 total? Actually raise to 12 means they added 8 more after BB 4. So total contributions: seat3 2, seat5 4, seat2 12, seat5 called 8? Wait seat5 called 8 (the raise amount is 12, they need to call 8 more). So seat5 contributed 4+8 =12. So total pot after preflop: seat3 2, seat5 12, seat2 12 = 26. Yes pot 26.\n\nNow flop Qc5d4d, no action yet. We have 113 chips left. Opponent stack 219.

If they bet, we can consider calling if pot odds favorable? Pot 26, bet maybe 12-20. Our pair of sixes is likely behind many hands: Qx, 5x, 4x, straight draws, flush draws (diamonds). So not good. So best to check and likely fold if they bet.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 8 (meaning raise to 8? Actually raise to total 8? But we already have 0 to call. Minimum raise to 8 means we can raise to 8 total? That would be a raise of 8 chips. That's small. Could consider a small raise as a bluff? But we have only 6's, not a good bluff on this board with Q high. Opponent may have Q, 5, 4, diamonds, etc. Raising may get called and we lose. Better to check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

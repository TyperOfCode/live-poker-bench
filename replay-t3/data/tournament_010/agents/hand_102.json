I could hit a straight (3-4-5-6-7 or 4-5-6-7-8) but those are very rare. Most of the time I'll miss completely.\n\nWith my short-ish stack of 11.5 BB, I should be selective about which hands I play. Even though it's only 32 chips to call (0.5 BB), I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nThe opponent in BB is very short with only 110 chips (less than 2 BB). If they have any decent hand, they'll likely shove. I don't want to call 32 and then face an all-in decision.\n\nI should fold this hand. It's not worth risking even 0.5 BB with such a weak holding.\n\nLet me check if I should recall any opponent information. Actually, I don't need to - the decision is clear based on hand strength alone. 2-9 offsuit is a fold in virtually all situations, especially with a short-ish stack.\n\nDecision: FOLD",

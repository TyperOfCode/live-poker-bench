It has almost no postflop playability, and if the short-stacked BB decides to shove, I'll have to fold anyway. \n\nThe only argument for calling might be to see a flop cheaply in position, but this hand will rarely hit anything usable. The risk of getting trapped or losing chips isn't worth it.\n\nI should fold this hand. There's no point in raising with 32o either, as it has zero value and any raise would be pure bluff that the short-stacked BB might call/shove over.\n\nLet me make the fold decision.",

On button, could steal but short stack? 12.9 BB, can raise to 32 min raise (i.e., raise to 32 total). That's 2x BB. Might be okay to raise and try to steal, but K7 is not great for a raise with many opponents (there are 2 opponents left: SB with 404 chips, BB with 102 chips). SB is big stack, likely to defend. BB is short stack 102 (5.1 BB). Could raise to 32, BB might call with many hands. Might be better to fold, preserving stack for better spots. Also could consider all-in? 206 is > min raise, but all-in is 206, maybe too much.\n\nGiven K7 offsuit is not premium, and short stack, I'd fold.\n\nCheck legal actions: fold, call, raise.

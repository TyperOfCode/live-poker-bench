MiniMax-M2 (SB, Seat 4):\n   - Recent actions show they call often from SB (hands 66, 67, 70)\n   - They bet postflop when they call preflop (hands 67, 70)\n   - They've folded some hands too (68, 69)\n   - Seems like a loose-passive player who calls wide but is aggressive postflop\n\n2. GPT-OSS-120B (BB, Seat 5):\n   - More aggressive - has made raises (hands 65, 68)\n   - But has been folding a lot recently (hands 67, 69, 70, 71)\n   - Shows they can make big raises (hand 65: raised to 174)\n   - Seems to be playing tighter recently\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- T2o is a very weak hand, ranked very low in poker hand rankings\n- It's offsuit and not connected\n- From the BTN, I could theoretically try to steal, but:\n  - MiniMax-M2 calls a lot from SB\n  - GPT-OSS-120B has shown they can make big raises\n  - I don't want to risk 16 chips with such a weak hand\n  - Even if I hit a T, I'll often be dominated by better kickers\n  - If I hit a 2, it's rarely good\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 25.8 BB\n- I should preserve my chips for better spots\n- The BTN gives me good position, but T2o is just too weak\n- The pot odds are 24:16 or 1.5:1, which isn't enough for this hand\n- No need to get involved with trash when I can wait for better hands\n\n**Decision:** Fold. This is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, and while I'm in good position, I don't want to invest chips with T2o. I'll wait for a better spot.",

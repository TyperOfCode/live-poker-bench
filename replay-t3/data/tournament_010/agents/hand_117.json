Should we consider a shove? Minimum raise to 128 is about 2 BB (plus call). Actually to raise to 128 total, you need to put 128 - 64 (already posted) = 64 more? Wait we have posted SB 32, BB 64.

Probably they are BTN but also posted SB because others folded and they are now in SB? Actually if all other seats are folded, the BTN becomes SB? Not sure. But given actions: seat5 posted SB, seat1 posted BB, so we are in SB. So amount to call is 32 (to call BB). So we can call 32 to see flop, but with 9c4s it's terrible. With 5 BB stack, we could consider going all-in (shove) if we think we can steal blinds? But 9c4s is not a good hand to shove. Usually with such weak hand you fold.

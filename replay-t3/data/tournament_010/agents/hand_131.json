Anyway we are in small blind with 9d4h, not a good hand. Amount to call is 32 (to match BB? Actually we already posted 32, amount to call 32 meaning we need to call BB's 64? Actually posted SB 32, BB 64, pot 96. To call we need to put 32 more to match BB's 64. So we can fold, call 32, or raise min to 128 total (so additional 96).

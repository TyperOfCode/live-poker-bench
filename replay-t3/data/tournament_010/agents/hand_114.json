            "reasoning_content": "  I can see that GPT-OSS-120B has been folding frequently (hands 101, 103, 105, 107, 113), with one call in hand 109 and one raise in hand 111. The raise was substantial (142 chips from BB position). This suggests they play relatively tight but can make aggressive moves occasionally.\n\nLooking at my situation:\n- I have K8s on the button with 10.5 BB\n- It's 32 to call (half a BB)\n- The opponent in the big blind has 174 chips (2.7 BB)\n- The minimum raise is 128 (2 BB)\n- I'm on the button with position\n\nWith K8s, I have a decent but not strong hand. Given that:\n1. I'm on the button with position\n2. The BB is relatively tight (folds a lot)\n3. I have 10.5 BB and could use some chips\n4. The BB only has 2.7 BB, so they're relatively short\n\nI should consider raising. A min-raise to 128 (2 BB) gives me fold equity against a tight player. If they call, I have position and a hand that can hit decent top pair hands.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful with my stack size. At 10.5 BB, I don't want to get into trouble. Let me think about the options:\n\n1. Fold - Too tight, I'm on the button with a decent hand\n2. Call - I could just call and see a flop, but that gives up fold equity\n3. Raise - Min-raise to 128 seems appropriate\n\nGiven the BB's tight nature and my position, I think a raise is the best play. This puts pressure on them and gives me a chance to win the pot preflop.",

Opponent is very tight and is 3-betting with a tiny stack\n2. My hand K8s is dominated by many hands they could have (AK, KQ, KJ, KT, etc.)\n3. I have a workable stack of 9 BB and don't need to take marginal spots\n4. The opponent likely has a strong hand given their tight nature and the fact they're risking their tournament life\n\nThis looks like a clear fold.

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide preflop action with 5h Th in BB, stack 174 (2.7 BB). Blinds 32/64, pot 192 (SB+BB+raise). Seat1 (Kimi) raised to 128 (i.e., raised 64 over BB). Amount to call 64 (to match 128). Minimum raise to 192 (i.e., raise additional 64). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nOur hand 5h Th is a suited Ten with a low kicker. In short stack situation (2.7 BB) we need to consider ICM and survival. 5hTh is not premium; it's a marginal hand. Against a raise from SB (seat1) who appears to raise varying amounts; from recall, they sometimes raise large (e.g., 276, 200) but also small (6, 12). Not clear. Our stack is 174, we have 64 to call, leaving 110 after call. That's about 1.7 BB left. If we call, we will be short-stacked. Could consider going all-in (raise to 174) but raise must be at least 192 (minimum raise), which exceeds our stack; we can go all-in for 174 (which is less than minimum raise, but all-in is allowed if can't meet min raise). So raise all-in is possible.\n\nBut is 5hTh strong enough to shove? At 2.7 BB, typical shoving range includes broadway combos, suited connectors, and maybe T9 suited, but 5hTh is a ten-high suited, not great but could be okay as a semi-bluff if opponent is tight. However, we are out of position (BB vs SB). SB raised, we are in BB (post-flop disadvantage). Usually with such short stack, you either fold or shove if you have enough equity. 5hTh vs unknown range: SB could be raising wide from SB (maybe 2-5% of hands). 5hTh equity vs wide range maybe ~30%? Might be okay to shove.\n\nBut also we have only 174 chips; the pot after call would be 256 (192+64). If we call, we have 110 left, still short. If we call and lose, we are out. If we shove and get called, we could double up.\n\nGiven the short stack, I'd likely shove (raise all-in). However need to check if legal: raise_to must be total amount we put in. All-in is 174 total (including BB 64 already posted). So raise_to = 174? Actually we have already posted 64 BB, plus we need to add 110 to go all-in, total 174. So raise_to = 174.\n\nBut is raise to 174 considered a raise? It's an all-in less than min raise, allowed. So action: raise, raise_to: 174.\n\nReasoning: short stack, marginal hand but decent suited ten, need to pick up chips, opponent's raise size moderate, we can shove to apply pressure.\n\nThus output JSON.",

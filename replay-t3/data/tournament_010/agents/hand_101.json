That seems contradictory: Usually button is not small blind. But maybe table has 2 players left: seat5 is BTN and also SB (since only 2 players left). In heads-up, BTN is SB and BB. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are small blind with 3d2d, stack 174, amount to call is 32 (to complete SB? Actually we already posted SB 32, amount to call is 32 to call BB's 64? Wait we posted 32, BB posted 64, so to call we need to put 32 more to match 64. Yes amount to call 32. Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., total bet 128). Our stack 174, so raise to 128 is possible. Hand 3d2d is very weak. In heads-up with 2.7 BB, we should likely fold or maybe shove? With 2.7 BB, many push/fold strategies: 3d2d is worst hand, you should fold.

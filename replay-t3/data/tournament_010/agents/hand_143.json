            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: Tc 8h - This is a weak offsuit hand with no real potential. It's a fold in almost any situation.\n\n2. **My position**: BB (Big Blind) - I'm out of position post-flop if I call.\n\n3. **My stack**: 480 chips (7.5 BB) - This is a short stack. I need to be very careful with chip preservation.\n\n4. **The action**: \n   - Small blind posted 32\n   - I posted big blind of 64\n   - GPT-OSS-120B raised to 366 (this is a huge raise, nearly 6x the big blind)\n\n5. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is 430 chips\n   - I need to call 302 chips to see the flop\n   - Pot odds: 430:302 or about 1.42:1\n   - This means I need about 41% equity to break even on a call\n\n6. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at the recall data for GPT-OSS-120B:\n   - They mostly fold preflop (hands 131, 133, 135, 137, 141, 142)\n   - They checked in hand 134 (when they had position?)\n   - They made a big bet on the turn in hand 134 (270 chips)\n   - They made the exact same raise size (366) in hand 139\n\n   The pattern suggests this opponent is either very tight or only raises with strong hands. The consistent 366 raise size in hands 139 and 143 suggests this might be their standard \"strong hand\" raise size.\n\n7. **My equity**: With T8o against a likely strong range, I probably have around 30-35% equity at best. This is not enough to justify calling 302 chips (63% of my stack) with a weak hand.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: With only 7.5 BB left, I need to preserve my chips for better spots. Calling here with T8o would leave me with only 178 chips, essentially committing me to the pot. This is a terrible spot to get committed.\n\n9. **Fold equity**: If I were to shove (go all-in for 480), I'd be risking 480 to win 430, which is not great. And against a strong range, T8o has poor equity.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. My hand is too weak, the opponent's raise size suggests strength, I'm out of position, and calling would commit too much of my short stack.",

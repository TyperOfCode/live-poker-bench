Wait actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 32, seat1 post_bb 64. So seat5 is small blind, seat1 is big blind. So we are SB, not BTN. Position: SB. Hand 5s7h is weak, not a good raise. With 5.7 BB, options: fold, call (32) to see flop, or raise to 128 (minimum). Raising is not advisable with such weak hand and short stack. Call is also risky but could be okay if we want to see flop cheap. However we are out of position post-flop vs BB. Short stack, maybe go all-in? Minimum raise to 128 is less than all-in (366). Could go all-in but that is not legal unless we raise to 366 (all-in). But legal actions include raise, we can raise to any amount >= min raise. Might be better to fold, as 5-7 unsuited low is terrible for short stack. Call would be 32 into pot 96, effective stack 366, but we would be out of position and likely dominated. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON.",

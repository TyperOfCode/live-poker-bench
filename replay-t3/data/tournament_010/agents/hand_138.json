Shove all-in with decent equity\n2. Fold marginal hands\n\n3-5 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. Even though I'm getting decent pot odds (calling 32 to win 96, or 3:1), this hand has very poor playability post-flop. \n\nGiven that:\n- I'm extremely short stacked\n- My hand is very weak\n- I only have one opponent left\n- I should preserve my chips for a better spot\n\nThe correct play is to fold. I don't want to invest 32 chips (6% of my stack) with such a weak hand. I need to wait for a better opportunity when I have a hand with some actual equity or better position with a stronger holding.\n\nEven though I have position (BTN), with only 8.5 BB, I can't afford to make speculative calls. I need to be shoving or folding in most spots. With 3-5 offsuit, this is a clear fold.",

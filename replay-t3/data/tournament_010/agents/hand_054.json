The other players folded. I need to call 4 chips to complete the blind, or I can raise to at least 16 chips total.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 seems fairly passive preflop. From the data, they've mostly folded or called, never raised preflop. They've called raises several times (hand 47, 48, 52) but tend to fold postflop if they don't hit. They have 182 chips (22.75 BB).\n\nWith pocket kings, this is an extremely strong hand preflop. I'm on the button with position advantage. The pot is currently 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8).\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Pocket kings is the second-best starting hand (only behind aces)\n2. I have position on the BB\n3. Opponent appears passive preflop\n4. I want to build the pot with this strong hand\n5. My stack is 326 vs opponent's 182\n\nI should definitely raise. The minimum raise is to 16 total (8 more). But with such a strong hand, I should make a larger raise to build the pot and potentially get all-in preflop against a weaker hand. Given the stacks, I could raise to around 24-32 chips (3-4x BB). This would be a standard raise size and put pressure on the BB.\n\nIf I raise to 24 total (20 more), that's 2.5x the BB. That seems reasonable.

Their raise to 24 chips seems consistent with their pattern, suggesting a reasonable hand rather than a bluff.\n\n**Tournament Position**: With 182 chips (22.8 BB), I'm in a medium stack position where chip preservation is important. This hand has terrible implied odds - even when it improves, it rarely wins significant pots.\n\n**Pot Odds Consideration**: While getting 2:1 pot odds might tempt a call with weak hands, 2c 5d is simply too weak to continue profitably. The hand has minimal playability and will often be dominated even when it makes marginal improvements.\n\nThis is a clear fold situation.

It's a 7-2 offsuit equivalent (2-5 offsuit is also very weak).\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the Big Blind (BB), so I'm getting a good price to see the flop (already invested 8 chips, need to call 16 more to see the flop).\n\n3. **Opponent Analysis**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's preflop raising patterns:\n   - They've been quite active with raises (10 instances in recent hands)\n   - Their raise sizes have been varied: 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 64, 72, 100\n   - The current raise to 24 chips seems consistent with their pattern\n   - No showdown information available, so I can't see how their hands performed\n\n4. **My Tournament Situation**:\n   - Stack: 182 chips (22.8 BB) - This is a medium stack\n   - Need to preserve chips for tournament survival\n   - Win rate so far: 35.8% (19 wins out of 53 hands)\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: \n   - Current pot: 32 chips\n   - Need to call: 16 chips\n   - Pot odds: 32/16 = 2:1\n   - This means I need about 33% equity to make a profitable call\n\n6. **Hand Strength Analysis**:\n   - 2c 5d has very poor equity against a typical raising range\n   - Even against a wide range, this hand would have maybe 15-20% equity\n   - The hand has very little playability - it's unlikely to improve significantly\n   - Even if it does improve (like making a straight or two pair), it will often be counterfeited or dominated\n\n7. **Tournament Considerations**:\n   - With 22.8 BB, I'm not short-stacked yet, but can't afford to waste chips\n   - This hand has terrible implied odds - even when it hits, it won't win big pots\n   - Better to wait for a better spot with better cards\n\n8. **Decision**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak to continue, even with the pot odds. \n\nThe mathematical expectation is decisively negative.

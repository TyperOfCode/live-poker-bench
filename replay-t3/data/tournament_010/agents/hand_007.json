            "reasoning_content": "  I have 8s Js from UTG position with 374 chips (187 BB deep). This is a decent suited connector hand that can make strong hands when it hits, but it's not a premium hand.\n\nFrom my position (UTG - first to act), I need to be careful. Playing speculative hands like suited connectors from early position is generally not recommended because:\n\n1. I'll be out of position post-flop against most players\n2. The hand doesn't have immediate strong value\n3. I could face raises behind me\n\nHowever, I have a deep stack (187 BB), which gives me good implied odds if I hit a strong hand. Let me consider the opponents:\n\nFrom the recent actions I can see:\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) and GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) both folded preflop in the last hand\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) called a raise in the last hand\n- In the previous hand (Hand #6), there was a big raise on the flop (80 chips) from Kimi-K2\n\nWith 8s Js, I have:\n- Potential to make flushes, straights, two pairs\n- Good implied odds with my deep stack\n- But I'm out of position\n\nThe pot is currently 3 chips and I need to call 2 to see a flop. That's giving me good pot odds.\n\nIn a tournament, from early position, I should generally play tight. However, with such deep stacks (187 BB), suited connectors can be profitable if played carefully.\n\nLet me think about the best play:\n- Folding is the safest option, especially from UTG\n- Calling gives me a chance to see a flop with good odds, but I'm out of position\n- Raising would be too aggressive with this hand from UTG\n\nGiven that I'm UTG with a speculative hand, and I want to preserve my tournament life while still having opportunities to accumulate chips, I think folding is the correct play here. The position disadvantage and the speculative nature of the hand make it a fold from early position in a tournament setting.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider - with 187 BB deep, I have great implied odds. The call is only 2 chips into a 3 chip pot. If I hit a strong hand, I could win a big pot. But the risk is that I could face a raise behind me and have to fold, losing the 2 chips.\n\nActually, I think the correct play is to **fold**. From UTG position in a tournament, I should be playing very tight. 8s Js is not strong enough to open from this position, even with deep stacks. The risk of facing a raise behind me and being out of position post-flop outweighs the potential upside.",

Blinds are 1/2.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression (raised to 4 from SB in hand #5, then called a raise to 10). Also made a big turn bet of 74 in that hand. Generally seems somewhat active.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded preflop (folded 5 of 6 hands). Only called once from BB in hand #4, then folded to a raise. Seems tight/passive.\n\nMy hand: K\u2665 T\u2665 is a decent hand on the button. It's a suited broadway connector with good playability postflop. From the button, I have position advantage.\n\nStack sizes: I have 229 (biggest at table), SB has 194, BB has 194. So we're all fairly deep (around 100 BB).\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: Too conservative with a decent hand on button against likely weak blinds.\n2. Call: Could be okay, but gives SB and BB good odds to call with any two cards.\n3. Raise: Standard play with KTs on button. Should raise to 4-6 BB (8-12 chips).\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies:\n- SB might defend with a wide range if I just call\n- BB is tight and likely to fold to a raise\n- SB might defend with some hands but could fold to a raise\n\nI should raise to around 6 BB (12 chips) to put pressure on the blinds. This is a standard button steal attempt with a decent hand.\n\nLet me check if there are any relevant observations about button raises."

Blinds are 1/2.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression (raised to 4 from SB in hand #5, then called a raise to 10). Also made a big turn bet of 74 in that hand. Generally seems somewhat active.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded preflop (folded 5 of 6 hands). Only called once from BB in hand #4, then folded to a raise. Seems tight/passive.\n\nMy hand: K\u2665 T\u2665 is a decent hand on the button. It's a suited broadway connector with good playability postflop. From the button, I have position advantage.\n\nStack sizes: I have 229 (biggest at table), SB has 194, BB has 194. So we're all fairly deep (around 100 BB).\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: Too conservative with a decent hand on button against likely weak blinds.\n2. Call: Could be okay, but gives SB and BB good odds to call with any two cards.\n3. Raise: Standard play with KTs on button. Should raise to 4-6 BB (8-12 chips).\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies:\n- SB might defend with a wide range if I just call\n- BB is tight and likely to fold to a raise\n- SB might defend with some hands but could fold to a raise\n\nI should raise to around 6 BB (12 chips) to put pressure on the blinds. This is a standard button steal attempt with a decent hand.\n\nLet me check if there are any relevant observations about button raises.",

I should raise to apply pressure on the blinds. The SB has shown some aggression, but the BB is tight/passive. A raise of 3-4x the big blind is standard.\n\nConsidering stack sizes (all around 100 BB), I should raise to about 10 chips total (5x BB). That's 8 chips to call for the SB and 8 chips to call for the BB.\n\nActually, wait - the minimum raise to is 4 chips total. That's only 2 chips more than the BB. That seems too small. I should raise more like 10-12 chips total.\n\nLet me calculate: If I raise to 10 chips total, that's 8 chips to call for the SB (they already have 1 in) and 6 chips to call for the BB (they already have 2 in).

While it's a suited connector with good potential, I'm out of position against all opponents. With aggressive players behind me (MiniMax-M2 has shown aggression, raising large in previous hands), I risk getting 3-bet frequently. With a healthy 70+ BB stack, I can afford to wait for better spots in better position rather than playing a speculative hand from the worst position at the table.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  This is hand #23, I'm UTG with T\u2665 J\u2665 (suited connectors). My stack is 282 chips (70.5 BB), which is healthy. The blinds are 2/4, so 4 chips to call.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: T\u2665 J\u2665 is a decent suited connector hand. It plays well in multiway pots and can make straights and flushes. However, from UTG, this is a marginal hand since I'll be out of position against everyone.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll act first on every street. This makes it harder to play drawing hands profitably.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) seems aggressive - they raised to 8 preflop in hand 21, then to 48 (big sizing), and have been betting postflop\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) seems more passive/cautious - they folded to a turn bet in hand 20, called then folded to a big raise in hand 21\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) seems moderately aggressive - raised to 12 in hand 22\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 282 (70.5 BB)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2: 213 (53 BB)\n   - MiniMax-M2: 289 (72 BB)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B: 204 (51 BB)\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 70+ BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots from early position. Stack preservation is important, but I can afford to see flops with speculative hands if the price is right.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 6 chips (1.5:1). This is not great immediate odds, but the implied odds could be good if I hit a strong hand.\n\nFrom UTG with a suited connector, the standard play is usually to fold. However, with deeper stacks (70+ BB) and the potential to win a big pot, some players might open-raise. But given:\n- I'm out of position\n- This is a marginal hand UTG\n- There are aggressive players behind me who might 3-bet\n- I don't have enough info to know if they'll call and give me implied odds\n\nI think the best play is to **fold**. If I were on the button or cutoff, I'd definitely raise. But UTG is too early for this hand.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. TJs is actually a borderline hand. Some tighter players fold it UTG, some looser players raise it. Given that:\n- Stacks are deep (70+ BB)\n- I have a suited connector that plays well postflop\n- The table seems to have some aggressive players who might call/raise\n\nIf I raise, I'd want to make it a standard 3x BB = 12 chips. This could:\n- Fold out weaker hands\n- Get called by worse hands\n- Build a pot when I have position and a strong hand\n\nBut I'm UTG - the worst position. And if I get 3-bet, I'll have to fold and lose 12 chips.\n\nI think the most prudent play from UTG with TJs is to **fold**. It's a marginal hand that gets much better in later position. From UTG, I should be playing a tighter range.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. Looking at the stack sizes, we're all relatively deep (50-70 BB). In modern poker, TJs is sometimes opened from UTG, especially in deeper stacked situations. The potential reward is high if I hit a strong hand.\n\nBut I don't have enough information about my opponents' 3-betting tendencies. If they're aggressive 3-bettors, I'll get blown off my hand frequently. The safer play is to fold and wait for a better spot or better position.\n\nI'll go with **fold** as the most fundamentally sound play from UTG with this hand.",

Actually it's Kh 4s, so not suited. This is a very marginal hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position. However, with only 2 players left to act (SB and BB), and the SB (MiniMax-M2) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B) are yet to act.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 213 chips (53.2 BB), which is healthy. MiniMax-M2 has 289 chips (72.25 BB), GPT-OSS-120B has 204 chips (51 BB).\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB): From the data, seems to be active. In hand #21, they made a preflop raise to 8, then re-raised to 48. In hand #22, they called a raise preflop. Seems capable of aggressive play.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has folded several hands preflop (hands 17-19, 22). Only raised once (hand #20 from BB position with just 4 chips which was actually just completing?). Actually looking at hand #20: they raised to 4 from BB when facing no raise? That might have been just checking? Actually \"raise\" to 4 from BB when BB is already 4 suggests they just checked. They seem relatively tight.\n\n5. **Current situation**: Everyone has folded to me on the Button. I can open-raise, call the BB, or fold.\n\n6. **Hand analysis**: Kh4o is a weak hand. Generally not recommended to open with this from any position, but being on the Button against just SB and BB, it's borderline. The problem is that if I raise, I'm likely to get called or re-raised by SB who seems aggressive. If I just call (limp), that's generally bad poker strategy as it invites the blinds to see a cheap flop with any two cards.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: I have 53 BB, which is a decent stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands.\n\n8. **Alternative considerations**: Some aggressive players might open-raise with any two cards on the Button, but Kh4o is particularly weak because it has poor playability postflop. The king is good but the 4 kicker is terrible.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best play is to **fold**. The hand is too weak to open-raise, and limping is bad strategy. I should wait for a better spot, especially since I have a healthy stack.\n\nLet me check if there are any other relevant observations about button opens."

Actually it's Kh 4s, so not suited. This is a very marginal hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position. However, with only 2 players left to act (SB and BB), and the SB (MiniMax-M2) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B) are yet to act.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 213 chips (53.2 BB), which is healthy. MiniMax-M2 has 289 chips (72.25 BB), GPT-OSS-120B has 204 chips (51 BB).\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB): From the data, seems to be active. In hand #21, they made a preflop raise to 8, then re-raised to 48. In hand #22, they called a raise preflop. Seems capable of aggressive play.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has folded several hands preflop (hands 17-19, 22). Only raised once (hand #20 from BB position with just 4 chips which was actually just completing?). Actually looking at hand #20: they raised to 4 from BB when facing no raise? That might have been just checking? Actually \"raise\" to 4 from BB when BB is already 4 suggests they just checked. They seem relatively tight.\n\n5. **Current situation**: Everyone has folded to me on the Button. I can open-raise, call the BB, or fold.\n\n6. **Hand analysis**: Kh4o is a weak hand. Generally not recommended to open with this from any position, but being on the Button against just SB and BB, it's borderline. The problem is that if I raise, I'm likely to get called or re-raised by SB who seems aggressive. If I just call (limp), that's generally bad poker strategy as it invites the blinds to see a cheap flop with any two cards.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: I have 53 BB, which is a decent stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands.\n\n8. **Alternative considerations**: Some aggressive players might open-raise with any two cards on the Button, but Kh4o is particularly weak because it has poor playability postflop. The king is good but the 4 kicker is terrible.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best play is to **fold**. The hand is too weak to open-raise, and limping is bad strategy. I should wait for a better spot, especially since I have a healthy stack.\n\nLet me check if there are any other relevant observations about button opens.",

I previously reasoned that folding is best because Kh4o is a weak hand, especially offsuit. I have position but the hand is poor. The SB seems aggressive and might re-raise. My stack is healthy at 53 BB, so I can wait for better spots.\n\nThus, I should fold.

Actually the raise to 8 means total bet is 8, so amount to call is 4 (difference between 8 and BB's 4). Minimum raise to 12 means raise must be at least to 12 total (i.e., raise of 4 more).

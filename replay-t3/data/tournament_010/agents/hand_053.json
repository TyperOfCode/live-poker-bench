            "reasoning_content": "  I need to think about my decision here. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ks 5d - This is a weak hand, offsuit with a weak kicker. K5o is generally a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: SB - I'm out of position against everyone, which is a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 236 chips (29.5 BB) - This is a healthy stack, not desperate yet.\n\n4. **Action**: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 20 (2.5x BB) from what appears to be MP/CO position. I need to call 16 chips.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: There's 32 in the pot, and I need to call 16, so I'm getting 2:1 pot odds. This means I need ~33% equity to call.\n\n6. **Opponent**: I don't have much history on GPT-OSS-120B from the search, so I need to assume a standard raising range.\n\nAgainst a typical MP/CO raise, K5o has very poor equity - probably around 30-35% at best against a standard 15-20% opening range. Even if I'm getting 2:1 pot odds, this is marginal at best, and I'm out of position which significantly reduces my ability to realize my equity.\n\nThe raise size of 2.5x suggests a legitimate hand, not a steal attempt. From a 178 chip stack (22 BB), this is a standard raise.\n\nKey factors against calling:\n- Weak hand (K5o)\n- Out of position\n- Tournament preservation - I don't need to gamble here\n- Reverse implied odds - if I hit my King, I could lose a big pot to a better kicker\n- Better spots will come\n\nI should fold this hand. There's no need to get involved with such a weak holding out of position, especially when I have a healthy stack.",

Offsuit with low cards, not connected, no straight potential. One of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n2. **Position:** We're out of position (BB vs single raiser). This makes playing postflop difficult.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has been raising preflop in some hands (hands 46, 47, 49) but also folding many hands recently (hands 48, 50, 51, 52). The recent pattern shows 4 consecutive folds preflop. The raise to 20 (2.5x) is a standard opening size.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** We need to call 12 to win 32, giving us 2.67:1 pot odds (27% equity needed). With J2o, we have ~32% equity against a typical opening range. However, this assumes we see all 5 cards, but we'll be out of position postflop.\n\n5. **Stack Sizes:** We have 330 chips (41 BB), opponent has 178 (22 BB). If we call and miss the flop, we'll face a continuation bet and likely have to fold. If we hit top pair with J, it's vulnerable.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** We have a healthy stack (41 BB). No need to gamble with weak hands. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n7. **Alternatives:** Raising is possible but would be a bluff with a terrible hand. Folding is the standard play.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. J2o is too weak to defend from the big blind against a single raise, especially out of position. The pot odds are decent but the hand has poor playability postflop. Better to wait for a better spot with our healthy stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"J2o is too weak to defend from BB against a single raise.

I have to act first with no information about what others will do.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 190 chips (23.8 BB) - I'm in the middle range, not short-stacked but not comfortable either.\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis**:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Recent history shows mostly folding preflop, with one check-check-fold sequence. This player seems tight/passive.\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): This player has been quite active with several raises preflop recently (hands 48, 49, 50, 51), suggesting they can be aggressive.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 chips to see the flop, with a pot of 12 chips. This is decent pot odds, but...\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 23.8 BB, I'm not desperately short-stacked, but I need to be careful about preserving chips.\n\n7. **My UTG Performance**: Looking at my recent UTG hands, I see I had pocket tens (hand 45) where I called and won big, but also had several folds with weak hands like 6h5h and 6cQs.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. With 4h3s in UTG position, I have:\n- Very little equity against any reasonable hand\n- Poor position \n- No information advantage\n- Better to wait for a stronger hand\n\nEven though the pot odds are decent (8 to call for a 12 chip pot = 2:1), the hand is simply too weak to play from UTG. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n",

Minimum raise to 16. So we can call 8 (to match BB), raise to at least 16 (total). Our hand Q9 suited is a decent BTN opening range, especially against SB and BB. Consider opponent tendencies: SB is Kimi-K2 Thinking. We retrieved recent raise actions: they sometimes raise 6, 12, 24, 28. That's from earlier hands. Not huge info. BB is DeepSeek-V3.2, unknown. In BTN, standard opening range includes Q9s. With 24.8 BB, we can raise to maybe 2.5x BB (20) or 3x (24). Since minimum raise is 16, raising to 20-24 is fine. Considering stack depth, we want to build chip and possibly steal blinds. So raise. Choose raise_to 20 (total). Reason: hand decent, position, steal, stack.\n\nWe must ensure raise amount is at least minimum (16). 20 is okay.\n\nThus output JSON.",

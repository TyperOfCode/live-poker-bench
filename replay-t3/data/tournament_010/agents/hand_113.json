With 3.7 BB, typical push/fold strategy: push all-in if hand is decent enough to be profitable vs blinds. 6hJc is weak. Usually you push with any two broadway or suited connectors? 6hJc is offsuit, low. Probably fold.\n\nBut we could consider stealing blind: 6hJc is not great but button can attempt steal with 3.7 BB. However many players will call with any pair, A-x, etc. The blind is a 64 stack, but they have 608 chips, so they can call. With 6hJc, chance to win maybe ~25% vs blind's range. Not worth risking.\n\nThus fold.\n\nWe must output JSON with action \"fold\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

This is a clear fold.\n\nI should fold here.",

I have to call 10 more to a pot of 18.\n\n**Hand strength:** 64s is a speculative hand. Suited connectors can play well multiway but I'm heads-up against a raiser. This is a weak hand preflop.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), opponent has 238 chips. We're both deep stacked.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** From the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop in 3 hands: \n- Hand 13: raised to 30 (7.5x BB)\n- Hand 20: raised to 4 (just the BB - likely a misclick or special situation)\n- Hand 25: raised to 24 (6x BB)\n\nLooks like they raise aggressively preflop, often with large sizing (6-7.5x BB). The current raise is 12 (3x BB), which is smaller than their typical raises.\n\n**Position:** Being on the BTN is advantageous, but I'm out of position against the raiser who is in MP/CO? Actually, Seat 5 is likely UTG+1 or MP? Let me check: Seat 1 folded (UTG), I'm BTN (Seat 3), Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB? Wait no - looking at actions: Seat 3 (me) posted SB 2, Seat 4 posted BB 4, Seat 5 raised 12. So Seat 5 is UTG? Actually if I'm BTN, then Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB. But the action says Seat 5 raised after posting BB? That doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 2\" (me), \"preflop: Seat 4 post_bb 4\", \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 12\". So Seat 5 is UTG (first to act after blinds). So they're raising from UTG position.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 18 (2+4+12), I need to call 10. That's 1.8:1 pot odds, or needing ~35.7% equity. 64s vs a UTG raising range has maybe 30-35% equity at best. Not great.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 51.8 BB, which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots with weak hands.\n\n**My history:** From my hands, I've been aggressive on BTN with good hands (KK, AA, KTs). I folded weak hands like 27o, K4o. 64s is borderline but probably too weak against a UTG raise.\n\n**Decision:** I should fold. While suited connectors can be playable, facing a UTG raise from a player who seems to raise aggressively, and being out of position postflop (they act after me on flop/turn/river since they're UTG and I'm BTN? Actually no - if they're UTG and I'm BTN, I have position on them. Wait, position order: UTG (Seat 5) acts first, then folds, then me (BTN), then SB, then BB. Actually if Seat 5 is UTG, they act first preflop, but postflop the action goes: SB, BB, UTG, BTN? Let me think: Blinds are Seat 3 (SB) and Seat 4 (BB). Seat 5 is UTG. Postflop, action starts with SB (Seat 3 - me), then BB (Seat 4), then UTG (Seat 5). So I would be out of position against the raiser! They act after me. That's bad.\n\nActually no, I'm confused. Let me reconstruct: Seat numbers: 1, 2, 3(me), 4, 5. I'm Seat 3 (BTN). Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB. But the action says Seat 5 raised after posting BB? That can't be right. Unless the hand is mislabeled? Actually \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 12\" - if Seat 5 is BB, they would have already posted 4. Raising to 12 means putting 8 more. That makes sense. So Seat 5 is BB raising after posting blind. So they're in BB position, not UTG.\n\nSo position: BB raised, I'm BTN. I have position on the raiser! That's good. But still, facing a"

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation:\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN with 4h6h. The action: UTG (Seat 1) folded, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 12 total (3x BB). I have to call 10 more to a pot of 18.\n\n**Hand strength:** 64s is a speculative hand. Suited connectors can play well multiway but I'm heads-up against a raiser. This is a weak hand preflop.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), opponent has 238 chips. We're both deep stacked.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** From the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop in 3 hands: \n- Hand 13: raised to 30 (7.5x BB)\n- Hand 20: raised to 4 (just the BB - likely a misclick or special situation)\n- Hand 25: raised to 24 (6x BB)\n\nLooks like they raise aggressively preflop, often with large sizing (6-7.5x BB). The current raise is 12 (3x BB), which is smaller than their typical raises.\n\n**Position:** Being on the BTN is advantageous, but I'm out of position against the raiser who is in MP/CO? Actually, Seat 5 is likely UTG+1 or MP? Let me check: Seat 1 folded (UTG), I'm BTN (Seat 3), Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB? Wait no - looking at actions: Seat 3 (me) posted SB 2, Seat 4 posted BB 4, Seat 5 raised 12. So Seat 5 is UTG? Actually if I'm BTN, then Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB. But the action says Seat 5 raised after posting BB? That doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 2\" (me), \"preflop: Seat 4 post_bb 4\", \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 12\". So Seat 5 is UTG (first to act after blinds). So they're raising from UTG position.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 18 (2+4+12), I need to call 10. That's 1.8:1 pot odds, or needing ~35.7% equity. 64s vs a UTG raising range has maybe 30-35% equity at best. Not great.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 51.8 BB, which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots with weak hands.\n\n**My history:** From my hands, I've been aggressive on BTN with good hands (KK, AA, KTs). I folded weak hands like 27o, K4o. 64s is borderline but probably too weak against a UTG raise.\n\n**Decision:** I should fold. While suited connectors can be playable, facing a UTG raise from a player who seems to raise aggressively, and being out of position postflop (they act after me on flop/turn/river since they're UTG and I'm BTN? Actually no - if they're UTG and I'm BTN, I have position on them. Wait, position order: UTG (Seat 5) acts first, then folds, then me (BTN), then SB, then BB. Actually if Seat 5 is UTG, they act first preflop, but postflop the action goes: SB, BB, UTG, BTN? Let me think: Blinds are Seat 3 (SB) and Seat 4 (BB). Seat 5 is UTG. Postflop, action starts with SB (Seat 3 - me), then BB (Seat 4), then UTG (Seat 5). So I would be out of position against the raiser! They act after me. That's bad.\n\nActually no, I'm confused. Let me reconstruct: Seat numbers: 1, 2, 3(me), 4, 5. I'm Seat 3 (BTN). Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB. But the action says Seat 5 raised after posting BB? That can't be right. Unless the hand is mislabeled? Actually \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 12\" - if Seat 5 is BB, they would have already posted 4. Raising to 12 means putting 8 more. That makes sense. So Seat 5 is BB raising after posting blind. So they're in BB position, not UTG.\n\nSo position: BB raised, I'm BTN. I have position on the raiser! That's good. But still, facing a",

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation properly. I'm on the BTN with 4h6h. The BB (Seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 12 total (3x BB). I need to call 10 more.\n\nFrom the opponent actions, GPT-OSS-120B has raised twice:\n- Hand 20: raised to 4 (just the BB amount, which seems like a misclick or special situation)\n- Hand 25: raised to 24 (6x BB)\n\nSo they've shown some aggression but not excessive. The current raise of 12 (3x BB) is more standard.\n\nMy hand: 64s is a speculative hand. As suited connectors, they play well in position with deep stacks. I have position on the raiser (I'm BTN, they're BB, so I act after them postflop). That's a big advantage.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 18, I need to call 10. That's 1.8:1, needing ~35.7% equity. Against a typical BB raising range (which might be wider since they're defending their blind), 64s likely has around 35-40% equity. So pot odds are borderline.\n\nStack sizes: I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), opponent has 238. We're both deep, which makes speculative hands more playable.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, no need to take big risks. But playing suited connectors in position with deep stacks can be profitable.\n\nMy own history: I've been folding weak hands, playing aggressively with premiums. I should be selective but not too tight.\n\nThe BB raised, which could be a steal attempt. They might have a wider range. Being in position with a suited connector is reasonable.\n\nHowever, 64s is one of the weakest suited connectors. The gap between 4 and 6 is small, but it's still low cards. I could consider calling to see a flop and potentially win a big pot if I hit a strong draw or two pair. But I need to be prepared to fold if I miss.\n\nLet me check if there are any other players left to act: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is SB and hasn't acted yet. They still need to act after me. So there's risk of a squeeze.\n\nActually, wait: The action order: I'm BTN, SB and BB already posted. BB raised. UTG (Seat 1) folded. Now it's on me (BTN). Then SB (Seat 4) acts, then back to BB if there's a raise. So SB could still raise.\n\nGiven all this, I think folding is prudent. 64s is too weak even in position against a raise. The pot odds aren't compelling enough, and there's still SB left to act who could squeeze. I should wait for better spots.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"64s is too weak against a BB raise, even with position.

It can make straights, flushes, and two pairs. It's not premium but has potential.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the button position, which is excellent. I have position on all opponents for the rest of the hand.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 223 chips (55.8 BB)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has 238 chips (59.5 BB)\n   - We're both at healthy stack sizes where we can play postflop effectively\n\n4. **The action**: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 12 chips from what appears to be the cutoff or late position. The blinds are 2/4, so this is a 3x raise from the blinds.\n\n5. **Amount to call**: 8 chips (they raised to 12, I need to call 8 more since I posted the big blind)\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 18 chips and I need to call 8 to continue. That's about 2.25:1 pot odds.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: We're in the middle stages with decent stacks. I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips, but not take unnecessary risks.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have a decent hand with good playability (suited connector)\n\n\n- The button position provides strategic flexibility\n- Pot odds are reasonable for a speculative hand\n- Opponent's recent tight play suggests a potential opportunity\n\nI'll proceed with a call, leveraging my positional advantage and the hand's potential to develop post-flop.",

This is a strong drawing hand with decent equity.\n\n**Position & Stack**: I'm in BTN position with 215 chips (53.8 BB), which gives me excellent position and a healthy stack to work with.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 12 preflop. From recent history, they appear to be a tight player who folds frequently preflop (4 folds in last 5 hands) but showed aggression in hand #25 with a 24-chip preflop raise.\n\n**Strategic Considerations**: \n- With position and a drawing hand, I should consider taking initiative\n- A continuation bet makes sense - my opponent raised preflop but I'm first to act on this coordinated board\n- The minimum raise to 8 chips is reasonable to build the pot while maintaining pot control\n- If my opponent is tight as their history suggests, they might fold weaker hands to aggression\n\n**Action**: I'll raise to 8 chips to take control of the pot and apply pressure. This continuation bet can win the pot immediately if they have a weak hand, and if they call or raise, I have good equity with my straight draw.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Continuation bet with open-ended straight draw in position.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n1. **Hand Analysis**: I have Ts Jd on a board of 8d 9h 6c\n   - This gives me an open-ended straight draw (JT can make a straight with Q, 7, or 10)\n   - I also have a backdoor flush draw with the Jd\n   - This is a decent drawing hand with some equity\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in BTN position, which is excellent for continuation betting and taking control\n\n3. **Stack**: 215 chips (53.8 BB) - I have a healthy stack to work with\n\n4. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 with 238 chips\n   - From the action history, I can see they raised preflop to 12 chips\n   - Looking at their recent actions, they tend to fold a lot preflop (4 folds in the last 5 hands)\n   - They showed some aggression in hand #25 with a 24 chip preflop raise\n   - They seem to be a tight player who only plays premium hands\n\n5. **Pot Analysis**: \n   - Pot is 26 chips\n   - I'm first to act on the flop\n   - No bet to call, so I can check or raise\n   - The minimum raise would be to 8 chips\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**:\n   - I'm at 53.8 BB which is a healthy stack\n   - I need to accumulate chips to stay competitive\n   - With a drawing hand, I should be looking for good spots to build the pot\n\n7. **Strategy Considerations**:\n   - With a straight draw and position, I should consider betting for value\n   - If my opponent is tight (as the history suggests), they might fold weaker hands\n   - A continuation bet could work well here\n   - However, I need to consider that they raised preflop, suggesting they have a decent hand\n   \nI'm weighing my options carefully. The 8-chip minimum raise seems like a strategic move to extract value. My straight draw provides multiple paths to improve my hand, and my position gives me a significant advantage. The opponent's tight playing style suggests they might fold to aggression, making a continuation bet a compelling approach.\n\nThe key is balancing pot control with potential equity. A small continuation bet around 12 chips looks optimal - it applies pressure without overcommitting. This allows me to represent strength while keeping the pot manageable, especially given the board's potential for drawing hands.\n\nThe minimum raise of 8 chips seems strategically sound, creating an opportunity to build the pot while maintaining flexibility for future streets. I'm positioning myself to potentially win through either direct betting or by setting up future strategic moves.\n",

The opponent has been betting throughout the hand, which suggests they might have a decent hand too, but they can't beat my straight.\n\nSince the amount to call is 0, I can check to let them bet, or I can raise to extract more value. Given that I have the nuts and position, I should raise to build the pot and get more value from what is likely a decent hand from my opponent.\n",

Legal raise to any amount >=8. We should consider potential 3-bet from opponents; they have shown willingness to raise big, so maybe they could 3-bet us.

No need 7 or T? Let's think: Straight combos: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 7), 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 7 and T? Actually you need 7 and T? Wait you have 8,9,6. For 6-7-8-9-10 you need both 7 and T. That's not possible with one card. So only open-ended draw is 7 to make 6-7-8-9-? Actually need also 5? Straight 5-6-7-8-9 needs 7 and 5? You have 6,8,9, need 7 and 5. Not possible. So actually you have only a gutshot? Let's enumerate possible straights containing 6,8,9: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 5 and 7), 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 7 and 10). So you need two cards. So you have no straight draw. You have two overcards (K,Q) vs board. Board is relatively low, no flush draws (two diamonds, one heart, one club). So hand is just K high, Q high. Not strong.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 bet 8 into pot 34, so pot now 42 after bet? Actually pot was 34, bet 8 adds to pot 42, we need call 8 to see turn.\n\nWe need to decide: call, raise, or fold. Our hand likely weak. Opponent's bet size is 8 (half pot). Could be continuation bet, could be trying to steal. Our stack 238, opponent stack 207. Opponent's tendencies: from recall we have three prior flop bets: amounts 6, 40, 12. Mixed sizes. No info on aggression.\n\nGiven we have KQ, could be decent showdown value if opponent has lower pair or draws. But board 8-9-6, opponent could have 8,9,6, or straight draw. Our KQ is decent overcards. But we are out of position (BB vs opponent in seat 4, which is UTG? Actually seat 4 is maybe MP). We are out of position post-flop.\n\nGiven tournament, stack 59.5 BB, not short. Probably fold to avoid losing 8 chips with weak hand. However maybe call to see turn if opponent is bluffing. The bet is small relative to pot, could be a probe.\n\nWhat is pot odds? Pot 34 + 8 bet = 42, call 8 to win 42, odds = 8/42 = 0.19, need 19% equity. Our hand vs unknown could be >19%? With KQ vs random? Might be around 30%? But opponent may have made a bet with range including many hands, our equity maybe lower. But we have two overcards, could be decent.\n\nGiven we have no draw, just showdown value, maybe call.\n\nBut consider opponent's previous flop bets: one was 6 (small), one 12 (small), one 40 (large). So they vary. Not enough.\n\nI think call.\n\nThus JSON: action call, raise_to null.\n\n",

Currently pot 42, turn check from opponent (MiniMax-M2). We are in BB, stack 230, opponent stack 207. Opponent checked, we can check or raise. What is opponent's likely range? Preflop they called raise 12 (so they have 8-9? Actually they called 12 after raise to 12? Preflop: we raised to 12, they called 8 (since they posted 4 bb, call 8). So they have a calling range: could be broadway, suited connectors, etc. On flop, board 8d 9h 6c, they bet 8 (small). We called. So they may have middle pair, draws, etc. Turn is 7h, giving board 8-9-6-7, making a straight draw for us (open-ended). Also board now has 8-9-7-6, no pair yet. Opponent checked. Likely they missed the straight, maybe have 8x, 9x, 67, etc. Could be a pair of 8s or 9s? They might have 8? If they had 8, they'd have top pair with a gutshot? Actually board has 8,9,6,7. If they have 8, they'd have pair. Might check to see if we bet. We have strong draw, equity high. Should we bet to represent a made hand and maybe get value if they have 8/9? Also we could check to induce bluffs later. Considering tournament, stack moderate, we can raise to build pot if we hit. Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8? Actually raise amount total must be at least 8 more than call? Minimum raise to 8 means total bet of 8? Since amount to call is 0, raising to 8 is a bet of 8. That is small. Could raise bigger, but only legal actions: raise (any amount up to stack). We can raise to maybe 30 or 40 to price in. Opponent stack 207, pot 42, we could bet ~20-30 to apply pressure.\n\nGiven open-ended straight draw, pot odds: need 5 or T. Two outs? Actually 4 outs each? Straight: need 5 or T, 4 cards each (four 5s, four Ts) = 8 outs. Plus maybe backdoor flush diamond: two more outs (if 5d or Td). So about 10 outs. On turn, we have 1 card left (river). Probability to hit: 10/46 \u2248 21.7%. So equity ~22% plus current hand maybe some showdown value if opponent has pair? Our hand currently is just high cards, no pair. If opponent has 8 or 9, they'd be ahead. So we need to consider pot odds: pot 42, if we bet 20, we risk 20 to win 62 (pot+bet). That's 20/62 = 32% needed. Our equity 22% < 32, not good. If we bet smaller 8, risk 8 to win 50, need 16% equity, which we have 22% > 16, so good. So small bet is +EV.\n\nThus we should raise (bet) to minimum 8 to apply pressure. Reason: we have decent equity and can fold if they raise. Also could check, but betting may win pot now.\n\nThus action: raise to 8. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action facing river bet 66 into pot 124, we have Kd Qc. Board: 8d 9h 6c 7h 2h. So board is 8-9-6-7-2 with two hearts (9h,7h). Our hand Kd Qc gives us straight? Let's see: board has 6,7,8,9. That's a 6-7-8-9 straight draw. We have K and Q, which gives us a gutshot? Actually Q completes a straight 6-7-8-9-10? No, Q is not 10. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 5), 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 10). We have K and Q, so no straight. Could we have a flush? Two hearts on board, we have no hearts. So no flush. So we have just high cards K and Q, which is not a made hand; best we have is King high. The board is fairly coordinated, could be many draws. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 66 on river. Pot before river bet: after turn, pot? Let's compute: Preflop: we raised to 12, opponent called 8 (so put 8). So pot after preflop: 12+8+ blinds? Blinds are 2 (SB) and 4 (BB). SB posted 2 (seat3) but folded, BB posted 4 (seat4) but then we raised? Actually seat4 posted BB 4, then we raised to 12 (so extra 8). So preflop contributions: SB 2 (folded), BB 4 (call?), but then we raise 12, so seat4 (BB) call 8? Actually seat4 is BB, they posted 4, then they called the raise? The action shows seat4 call 8 (so they put additional 8). So preflop contributions: seat5 (us) 12, seat4 8+4=12? Actually seat4 posted 4 blind then called 8, total 12. So pot = 2+12+12 = 26? Wait SB 2, BB 4, then raise to 12 (so we put 12), BB calls 8 (total 12). So total chips: SB 2, BB 12, us 12 = 26. Yes pot 26 preflop.\n\nFlop: seat4 bet 8, seat5 call 8. So add 16 to pot => pot 42.\n\nTurn: seat4 check, seat5 bet 8, seat4 call 8. Add 16 => pot 58.\n\nRiver: seat4 bet 66, we face 66 to call. So pot before river bet = 58. After bet, pot would be 58+66 =124 (matches given pot). So we need to call 66 to win 124. Pot odds = 66/ (66+124?) Actually call amount 66 to win 124+66? Wait after call, total pot = 124+66 =190. So odds = 66/190 = 34.7% needed. Our hand is King high, basically a bluff-catcher? Opponent may be betting as bluff or value. Board is 8-9-6-7-2. Could opponent have a straight? They could have 5 or 10. Could have a pair, two pair, trips, etc. Our KQ is not a made hand; we likely lose most of time. So folding is correct.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: recall shows they raised river 24 once, checked twice, folded once. Not much data. Probably they bet for value with decent hand. So we fold.\n\nWe have stack 222, calling would leave 156. Not huge.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 5d 5s (pocket fives) - a mediocre pair, but could be strong if I hit a set\n\n**Position**: BB (out of position postflop)\n\n**Stack**: 276 chips (8.6 BB) - This is a short stack, I'm in danger territory\n\n**Pot**: 112 chips before my action\n\n**Action**: MiniMax-M2 raised to 64 (2x the big blind)\n\n**To call**: 32 more chips\n\n**Pot odds**: 112:32 = 3.5:1\n\n**Key considerations**:\n1. With 8.6 BB, I'm short-stacked. I need to be thinking about survival and chip preservation, but also looking for spots to double up.\n2. Pocket fives have about 50-60% equity against typical raising ranges in heads-up, but I'm out of position.\n3. If I call, pot will be 144 and I'll have 244 left (7.6 BB effective)\n4. If I raise, minimum is to 96 (which is 64 more). That would leave me with 212 chips.\n5. The opponent MiniMax-M2 has been raising frequently preflop based on the history I retrieved.\n\nLooking at the opponent's pattern:\n- MiniMax-M2 raises frequently (10 raises in 82 hands)\n- Most raises are small (8, 28, 32, 48, 64 chips)\n- This suggests they raise with a wide range\n\nWith pocket fives and a short stack:\n- Calling is risky because I'm out of position and will miss the flop ~88% of the time\n- Raising to 96 commits me to the pot but gives me fold equity\n- Folding preserves my 276 chips but gives up on a decent hand\n\nWith 8.6 BB, pocket fives is actually a reasonably strong hand. I should either:\n1. Fold and preserve my stack for a better spot\n2. Push all-in and use my fold equity + hand equity\n\nGiven I'm out of position and short-stacked, I think the best play is to go all-in. This:\n- Maximizes fold equity against a wide raiser\n- Gets maximum value when I'm ahead\n\n\n- Simplifies the decision and avoids tough postflop spots\n- Gives me a chance to double up to ~580 chips\n\nAn all-in move leverages my current position perfectly. It's a strategic play that capitalizes on my short stack and the opponent's aggressive raising tendencies. By pushing all my chips in, I'm creating maximum pressure and giving myself the best mathematical chance to increase my chip stack significantly.",

            "reasoning_content": "  This is a critical tournament spot. Let me analyze:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm in BB with 32 chips (exactly 1 big blind)\n- I have pocket 5s (5d 5s)\n- Board: 2s 9c 6s\n- Pot: 568 chips\n- Only opponent is MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4 with 90 chips\n- I have 0 to call (it's checked to me)\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have a low pocket pair (5s)\n- The flop is 2s 9c 6s - this is a very coordinated board with a flush draw\n- I currently have an underpair to the board (board has 9,6,2)\n- There are 2 spades on board and I have the 5s, so I have a flush draw\n- I have 4 outs to a set (the remaining 5s)\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- I have 32 chips left (1 BB)\n- Opponent has 90 chips (about 3 BBs)\n- The pot is 568 chips - this is massive relative to our stacks\n\n**Opponent info from recall:**\n- MiniMax-M2 has been relatively aggressive preflop with raises\n- They've shown down some decent hands (AA, TT, 44)\n- They called my all-in preflop with 212 chips, which suggests they have a decent hand\n- They bet on flops in several hands\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Pot odds:** The pot is 568 and I have 32. If I check, I see a free card. If I bet, I'm essentially all-in.\n2. **Hand strength:** I have an underpair with a flush draw. This is a marginal hand but given the pot size and my stack, I should be looking to get my money in.\n3. **Tournament situation:** With only 1 BB left, I need to take any reasonable spot to double/triple up. This is actually a decent spot given the pot size.\n4. **Opponent's range:** They called my preflop all-in, so they likely have a decent hand - probably a pair, two high cards, or maybe a suited connector.\n\n**The play:** With 0 to call and having a flush draw + potential set outs, I should check and see a free card. However, given my tiny stack (1 BB) and the massive pot (568), I should consider shoving to apply pressure and potentially win the pot right now. But wait - it's checked to me, so checking is free.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions: \"fold, check\" - I cannot raise because the minimum raise is 212 which is more than my stack of 32. So my only options are fold or check.\n\nI should definitely check here. I get to see a free turn card with my flush draw and underpair. If I hit my flush or trips, I can potentially win a huge pot. Folding would be terrible with these odds.\n\nWait, let me reconsider - if I have 32 chips and the minimum raise is 212, I cannot raise. But typically in this situation, I should be able to go all-in for my remaining 32. The legal actions might be incorrectly listed, or it might be that since I can't meet the minimum raise, I can only check or fold.\n\nGiven the pot is 568 and I have 32, checking is clearly the right play to see a free card.",

If I had 308, that would leave me with 64 chips, not 32.\n4. Actually, looking more carefully: The raise to 276 might mean \"raise TO 276 total\", not \"raise BY 276\". So if I posted 32 as BB, then raised to 276 total, that would be an additional 244 chips.

With 32 chips left and a pot of 568, I'm getting 568:32 or 17.75:1 pot odds\n2. My set of 5s is very vulnerable on this board\n3. Any spade gives opponent a flush\n4.

Opponent checked the flop, which could mean:\n   - They have a weak hand\n   - They have a strong hand and are trapping\n   - They have a draw and want a free card\n\n6. Given that I have such a small stack left relative to the pot (32 into 568), I should be willing to go all-in with any reasonable hand\n7.

The board is:\n2s 9c 6s 8s\n\nMy hand: 5d 5s\n\nI have a set of 5s. But there are 4 spades on board, so any spade beats me. Also, a 7 makes a straight.\n\nGiven that opponent called my all-in preflop, they likely have:\n- High pocket pair (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT)\n- AK, AQ\n- Maybe a suited connector\n\nIf they have two spades, they already have a flush. If they have one spade, they have a flush draw.\n\nGiven that opponent checked the flop (2s 9c 6s), they might have:\n- No spade and are scared of"

Given that I have such a small stack left relative to the pot (32 into 568), I should be willing to go all-in with any reasonable hand\n7. However, I need to consider if checking is the right play or if I should just fold\n\n**What would I search for?**\nI could search for opponent tendencies, but given the critical nature of this decision and the fact that I have a set (albeit vulnerable) and I'm getting 17.75:1 on my remaining chips, I think I should check and see what opponent does.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The board is:\n2s 9c 6s 8s\n\nMy hand: 5d 5s\n\nI have a set of 5s. But there are 4 spades on board, so any spade beats me. Also, a 7 makes a straight.\n\nGiven that opponent called my all-in preflop, they likely have:\n- High pocket pair (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT)\n- AK, AQ\n- Maybe a suited connector\n\nIf they have two spades, they already have a flush. If they have one spade, they have a flush draw.\n\nGiven that opponent checked the flop (2s 9c 6s), they might have:\n- No spade and are scared of",

The pot is massive compared to my remaining chips, making any bet a potential all-in scenario. I need to carefully weigh the risk of losing my last chips against the potential gain of winning a substantial pot.\n\nThe opponent's previous betting patterns reveal an aggressive postflop strategy, particularly on the turn. Their recent check suggests potential weakness, which might be an opportunity for a strategic move. However, my limited stack and marginal hand strength require extreme caution.\n\nGiven the circumstances, checking seems the most prudent action. This preserves my last remaining chips while avoiding unnecessary risk with a vulnerable hand. The potential for a flush or straight on the board further complicates any aggressive play.",

This suggests they might fold to aggression with weaker holdings.\n\n**My decision:** I'll raise to 64 chips (2x the big blind). This serves multiple purposes:\n1. ATs is strong enough to build a pot in position\n2. I can apply pressure on the big blind who may be weak\n3. A 2x raise is a standard sizing that doesn't commit too much of my stack\n4.

It's good for making straights, flushes, and top pairs.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position. I get to act last preflop and on all subsequent streets.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 366 chips (11.4 BB), which is a medium stack. Not short stacked, but not deep either.\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis**:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has 276 chips and is in the big blind\n   - From my recall, I can see that Kimi-K2 Thinking has been quite active with raises - they've raised in 10 recent hands with varying amounts (6, 6, 28, 12, 12, 24, 200, 48, 32, 48)\n   - Their showdown hands show they play a range of hands: 99, As8h, 98s, JdJc\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has 268 chips and is in the small blind\n\n5. **Current Situation**: \n   - Small blind posted 16, big blind posted 32\n   - I need to call 32 to stay in the hand\n   - Minimum raise would be to 64 (2x the big blind)\n   - The pot is currently 48 chips\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: \n   - I'm at 11.4 BB, so I need to be somewhat aggressive to accumulate chips\n   - ATs is a premium hand that plays well in position\n   - With 3 players left (others folded), this is a good spot to build a pot\n\n7. **Decision Factors**:\n   - ATs is strong enough to raise for value\n   - I'm in position, which gives me a significant advantage\n   - I can apply pressure on the big blind who may be weak\n   - A raise to 64 (2x BB) would be a reasonable sizing\n   \nI'll leverage my positional advantage and the strength of my Ace-Ten suited to make a strategic move. The button position allows me to extract maximum value while maintaining control of the pot size. By raising to 64, I can pressure opponents and potentially win the hand without a showdown.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I have Ts Ac (Ace-Ten suited)\n- I'm in BTN position with 302 chips (9.4 BB)\n- Opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 32 chips (1 BB)\n- They just raised all-in to 276 chips total\n- I need to call 212 chips to stay in the hand\n- Current pot is 356 chips\n\n**Key Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Ace-Ten suited is a decent hand, especially in position. It's ahead of most random hands and has good playability.\n\n2. **Stack Considerations**: \n   - I'm at 9.4 BB, so this is a medium-deep stack\n   - Opponent is at 1 BB, effectively all-in\n   - The call would put me to 90 chips (2.8 BB) if I call and lose\n   - This is a significant portion of my stack (70% of my chips)\n\n3. **Opponent Analysis**: From the data I recalled, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been active with preflop raises, including some larger ones. However, I don't see specific patterns of them being overly aggressive with weak hands.\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: \n   - Pot is 356 chips\n   - I need to call 212 chips\n   - Pot odds are about 1.68:1\n   - This means I need about 37% equity to break even\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: \n   - I'm at 9.4 BB, so I'm not desperately short stacked\n   - Calling here would leave me very short if I lose\n   - However, if I win, I'd have 514 chips and be back to 16 BB\n\n6. **Equity Considerations**: \n   - Against a random hand, Ace-Ten suited has about 60-65% equity\n   - Against a likely range from a short stack (which might include weaker hands), this should still be ahead\n   \nThe short stack's all-in move suggests a potential desperation play, likely holding marginal cards. Their limited chip count indicates they might be pushing with hands that wouldn't typically warrant such aggressive action. This context makes Ace-Ten suited even more attractive, as I'm likely ahead of their probable range of weaker holdings.",

In hand 79, I had Ks 3s and won by betting on the turn after checking the flop. This shows I can be successful with aggressive play when the situation is right.\n\nHowever, the key difference here is that I'm very short-stacked (90 chips) compared to that hand where I had more chips to work with. The pot is also much larger (568 chips vs 208 chips in hand 79).\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have Ace high with flush draw potential\n2. I'm getting a free card \n3. I'm very short-stacked\n4. The pot is large and getting a free card is valuable\n\nThe check seems like the best option to see the turn and potentially improve. If I hit a flush, pair the Ace, or make a straight, I can then bet aggressively. If not, I can reassess.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With only 90 chips and a 568 chip pot, if I have any equity at all, I might want to consider betting now rather than checking. The opponent checked, which suggests weakness. If I bet and they fold, I win 568 chips instantly. If they call or raise, I still have a chance to improve.\n\nBut given my stack size and the fact that the minimum raise would be 212 (more than double my stack), if I'm going to bet, I'd essentially be going all-in. That seems too aggressive with just Ace high.\n\nI think the conservative approach of checking is best here.\n",

This suggests they're either weak or playing passively.\n\n**Stack & Tournament Situation:**\n- I'm short stacked at 90 chips (2.8 BB)\n- Opponent has even fewer chips (32)\n- The pot is massive (568 chips) relative to our stacks\n- This appears to be a crucial tournament spot\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that:\n1. I have Ace high which needs improvement to win\n2. There's a flush draw that could give me the nuts\n3. Opponent has been consistently passive on turns\n4. I'm short stacked and this pot is enormous\n5. The minimum raise to 212 would be a significant portion of my stack\n\nThis seems like a good spot to make a move.

I'm short stacked and this could be a crucial hand\n5. \n\nThe flush draw creates a compelling opportunity. With the Ace of spades, I'm positioned for a potential nut flush if the river completes the suit. Given my short stack and the opponent's consistent checking, a strategic bet could capitalize on their passive tendencies.

            "reasoning_content": "We have SB with As 4c. Stack 268, blinds 16/32, pot 112 (SB posted 16, BB 32, raise to 64 from seat 4). So effective stack: we have 268, opponent (seat 4) has 302. Minimum raise to 96 (i.e., raise amount total = 96). Amount to call is 48 (they raised 64, we posted 16, so need 48 more). Hand As4c is weak suited Ace low kicker. In SB, short stack 8.4 BB, need to consider fold or call? 48 call is 1.5 BB (since SB is 16 BB, but effective BB is 32). Actually 48 is 1.5 BB (relative to big blind). With 8.4 BB stack, calling 48 leaves us with 268-48=220 chips, still decent. But As4c is not great for calling a raise from MP (seat 4 maybe MP). Opponent's raise size is 64 (2 BB raise). In SB, typical open raise from MP is 2-2.5 BB. So they are raising standard. With A4s, it's a marginal hand. Could consider calling to see flop with suited Ace, maybe try to see cheap flop, but we are out of position for rest of hand. However stack is shallow, but not super short. In tournament, with 8.4 BB, we should be careful not to waste chips. A4s is not a good call; maybe fold.\n\nWe can also consider raising (3-bet) to 96 total (i.e., raise 96). That would be 96 total, which is 3 BB raise (since big blind 32). That would be 96-16 posted = 80 additional. But we have 268, can raise. But 3-bet with A4s is too weak, likely not good.\n\nThus best action: fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been raising sometimes (hand 81 raise 64 preflop). Also raised 64 in hand 81. So they are capable of raising with a range. Not a tight player. So folding is safe.\n\nThus output JSON.",

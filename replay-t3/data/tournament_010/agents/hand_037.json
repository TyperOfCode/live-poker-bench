            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My Hand**: 7h Th (7 of hearts, 10 of hearts)\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Great position\n**Stack**: 308 chips (77 BB) - Healthy stack\n**Blinds**: 2/4\n**Pot**: 6 chips\n**To call**: 2 chips\n**Min raise**: 8 chips\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Everyone folded to me on the button\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 is in the BB with 389 chips\n- I have a suited connector (7h Th) - this is a speculative hand that can hit strong draws and disguised hands\n\n**Analysis of DeepSeek-V3.2 from the recall**:\nLooking at their recent actions:\n- Hand 27: Raised to 16 preflop, then to 100 (very aggressive)\n- Hand 28: Folded\n- Hand 29: Called 8 preflop, called 18 on flop, checked turn and river (passive)\n- Hand 30-32: Folded preflop\n- Hand 33: Checked through, then bet 6 on river (tricky)\n- Hand 34: Folded\n- Hand 35: Raised to 12 preflop, bet 20 on flop, raised to 80 on turn, called 60 on river (very aggressive)\n- Hand 36: Folded\n\nDeepSeek-V3.2 seems to be playing a somewhat aggressive style with selective hands. They mix it up - sometimes folding, sometimes raising.\n\n**My decision**:\nI'm on the button with a suited connector. This is a perfect stealing spot since everyone folded to me. However, 7h Th is not a great hand to raise for value, but it's good for a steal attempt.\n\nOptions:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight. I have position and a playable hand.\n2. **Call**: Not great either. I'm just completing the blind with a marginal hand.\n3. **Raise**: This is the best option. I can steal the blinds, and if called, I have position and a hand that can hit disguised strong hands.\n\nI should raise to steal. The minimum raise is 8 (to 8 total, which is 4 more). A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 12 total. Given that DeepSeek-V3.2 has shown they can fold to aggression (they folded several times), a raise to 12 seems appropriate.\n\nLet me raise to 12 chips (3x BB). This is a standard steal size and gives me good fold equity.\n\n\nI'll go with a strategic raise to 12 chips, leveraging my position and the opponent's tendency to fold under pressure. The raise puts pressure on the big blind while maintaining a reasonable risk-reward ratio. A 3x big blind raise provides solid fold equity without overcommitting chips on a speculative hand.",

They called my preflop raise, so they likely have some hand.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Pot odds**: Pot is 24, checking is free. Good to see free card.\n2. **Equity**: I have a flush draw (9 outs) and straight draw (6 outs but some overlap), so roughly 12-15 outs = ~25-30% equity\n3. **Implied odds**: If I hit my flush or straight, I might win a big pot\n4. **Position**: I have position advantage - I act last\n5. **Stack preservation**: I have a healthy stack, no need to risk chips with a marginal draw\n6. **Board texture**: Very coordinated board - many hands beat me currently\n\n**Recommendation**: Check. I have a free card opportunity with decent equity. I don't want to build a big pot with just a draw on this coordinated board. I can re-evaluate on the turn. I have position so I can control the pot size.\n\nThe legal actions are: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, I should check.",

The board shows Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s. I have no pair, no flush (only one heart on board), no straight (I have 7-10, board has 8-9 but no 6 or J to complete a straight). I essentially have nothing - just 7-high.\n\n2. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 is in the BB position. Looking at their history:\n   - They've been fairly active, making raises and bets\n   - In hand 35, they were very aggressive (raise to 80 on turn, call 60 on river)\n   - They've shown willingness to call and raise with various holdings\n   - They called my preflop raise, then checked flop, turn, and now haven't acted on river yet\n\n3. **Action so far**:\n   - Preflop: I raised to 12, they called\n   - Flop: I checked, they checked\n   - Turn: I checked, they checked\n   - River: It's on me to act\n\n4. **Current situation**:\n   - Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n   - Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n   - The pot is 24 chips\n\nGiven that I have absolutely nothing (7-high) and my opponent has shown they can be aggressive, checking here is the clear best option. There's no value in betting - I can't get called by worse hands. If I bet, I'm bluffing with no equity and no fold equity against an opponent who has shown they can call bets.\n\nI should check and hope to get to showdown for free, or fold if they bet (though they haven't acted yet on the river - it's my action).\n \nThe action sequence reveals a critical detail - the prompt indicates \"Amount to call: 0\", which means DeepSeek-V3.2 has already checked. This gives me a free opportunity to see the showdown without risking additional chips. Checking is now the most strategically sound move, allowing me to conserve my stack while potentially winning the pot with my current hand.\n\nMy 7-high is extremely weak, but the checked action suggests my opponent might also be holding a marginal hand. I'll take the free showdown and see what happens, minimizing my risk while preserving the chance of winning the pot.",

This is a missed hand. I have:\n- No pair (my highest card is 10)\n- No flush draw (only one heart)\n- No straight draw (I have 7-10, board has 8-9, so I missed the straight by one card)\n\nSo I have absolutely nothing. I'm playing the board at best.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nDeepSeek-V3.2 just bet 12 into a 36 chip pot on the river. Let me look at their patterns:\n- They seem to be a fairly active player with mixed strategies\n- They've made river bets before (hand 33 bet 6, hand 35 called 60)\n- In hand 29, they checked the river after checking turn\n- In hand 35, they called a large river bet (60)\n\nThis river bet of 12 into 36 is a 1/3 pot bet, which could be:\n- Value bet with a strong hand\n- Bluff/semi-bluff\n- Thin value bet\n\n**Pot odds:**\nI need to call 12 to win 48 (36 + 12), which is 4:1 pot odds or 25% equity needed.\n\n**My decision:**\nWith absolutely no hand (just 10-high), I should fold. Even though the bet is small relative to pot, I have no showdown value. The opponent could be bluffing, but with 10-high I cannot call.\n\nLet me think about any possible reason to call:\n- Could I have the best hand? Unlikely - any pair, any Ace, any King beats me\n- Could they be bluffing enough? Maybe, but 10-high is just too weak to call\n- The price is cheap, but I have 0% chance of winning unless they have exactly missed draws\n\nThe board shows Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s - potential missed draws:\n- Flush draws: There are spades on board, someone could have had spade draw\n- Straight draws: QJ, QT, JT, 76 could have been straight draws\n- But many of these would have hit or still be strong\n\nGiven I have complete air, I should fold. The 12 chip call would be burning chips. \n\nEven if my opponent's patterns suggest potential bluffing opportunities, the absolute weakness of my hand makes calling an unwise strategic move. I'll preserve my chips for a better spot.",

The 3x raise from SB is standard.\n\nMy hand JTo is decent but not great, especially offsuit. It's a hand that can make straights and sometimes top pair, but has reverse implied odds (dominated by AJ, KJ, QJ, etc.).\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 16, which is 2:1 odds (33% equity needed). JTo vs a typical SB raising range (maybe 30-40% of hands) has about 35-40% equity, so pot odds are favorable.\n\nHowever, position is bad - I'll be out of position postflop. JTo plays poorly out of position.\n\nStack sizes: I have a healthy stack (97 BB), opponent has 74 BB. Not deep enough for implied odds to play speculative hands.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm in good chip position, no need to take marginal spots.\n\nGiven this is heads-up SB vs BB, ranges widen considerably. SB should be raising wide, and BB should be defending wide. But JTo is near the bottom of a defending range.\n\nI could consider a 3-bet bluff since SB might be raising light, but with JTo and out of position, that's risky.\n\nBetter to just call and see a flop with decent pot odds, then play carefully postflop. If I hit a good flop (pair + straight draw, etc.), I can continue. Otherwise, fold.\n\nLet me call and see a flop.",

Wait, board is K-A-9, my J-T gives me an open-ended straight draw? Let me check: Board: Kd, Ad, 9h. My Js Td. Possible straights: QJ-T-9-8? Actually, with K-A-9 on board and J-T in hand, I need a Q for a straight (K-Q-J-T-9). That's a gutshot, not open-ended. Also have backdoor flush potential with the Td and board having Kd, but only one diamond so far. Very weak made hand - only high card is J, but board has K and A higher. Basically I have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs to a Q) and very little else.\n\n**Position:** I'm in BB, opponent is SB who raised preflop. They checked to me on the flop.\n\n**Opponent Analysis from memory:**\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has shown aggressive preflop raising tendencies (5 raises in 36 hands)\n- They've shown hands like 9s8s, 9s9d, As8h at showdown\n- On the flop, they often check (multiple instances) but also bet sometimes\n- In hand #29 with 99, they bet 18 on flop after raising preflop\n- In hand #6 with 98s, they bet 28 on flop\n\n**Pot Odds:** Pot is 24, I can check for free or bet. If I bet and get called, I need to consider future streets.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I have a healthy stack (381 vs opponent's 298). This is a marginal spot where I could try to take the pot with a bet, but need to be careful.\n\n**Possible Actions:**\n1. **Check:** Take a free card with my gutshot draw. Safe play given weak hand.\n2. **Bet:** Try to take the pot down now. Opponent checked, which could indicate weakness. A bet of around 12-16 (half pot) might work.\n\n**Opponent Range:** They raised preflop from SB. Could have: pairs (especially medium pairs like TT-QQ, maybe 99), Broadway cards (AQ, AJ, KQ, etc.), suited connectors. The flop K-A-9 hits a lot of their raising range (AK, AQ, AJ, KQ, maybe AA, KK, 99). But they checked, which suggests they might not have hit strongly or have a medium-strength hand.\n\n**My Image:** From my hand history, I recently won a big pot with QsKh (hand #35) and have been playing fairly tight.\n\n**Decision:** I think a small bet could work here. Opponent checked, which often shows weakness after raising preflop. They might fold hands like medium pairs (TT-QQ) that are afraid of the A and K on board. My bet would represent strength - maybe I have an A or K. Even if called, I still have my gutshot draw.\n\nBut I need to consider: If I bet and get raised, I'll have to fold. That would be bad. However, looking at opponent's history, they don't seem to check-raise much on flop (search showed no matches).\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The board is Kd Ad 9h. This is a very wet board that hits a lot of raising ranges. My J-high is basically air with a gutshot. A bet here is a pure bluff. Is it a good bluff?\n\nFactors favoring a bluff:\n1. Opponent checked (showing weakness)\n2. I'm out of position, so taking initiative could help\n3. Board has A and K, which are scare cards for many hands\n\nFactors against bluffing:\n1. I have some equity (gutshot) so checking to see a free card isn't terrible\n2. Opponent might call with any pair or draw\n3. If called, I'll be out of position on later streets\n\nGiven my tournament chip stack is healthy, I think checking is reasonable. I can see a free turn card and potentially hit my straight. If I miss, I can give up unless the turn improves my hand in some way.\n\nActually, wait - I'm in the BB"

Opponent (SB who raised preflop) checked to me. I'm in BB. Pot is 24. I can check or raise (bet). \n\nMy hand: Jack-high with gutshot straight draw (need Q). Very weak made hand. \n\nOpponent checked. Could be checking with a strong hand to trap, or weak hand. From memory, opponent is somewhat aggressive but not excessively so. They've shown hands like 98s, 99, A8s. \n\nIf I bet, I'm representing strength on an A-high board. Could get folds from medium pairs, maybe some weak aces. But if opponent has an ace or king, they'll likely call or raise. \n\nPot odds: Checking is free. Betting risks chips with a weak hand. \n\nGiven I have some equity (gutshot ~8% to hit on turn, ~16% by river), taking a free card seems reasonable. Also, I'm out of position, which makes bluffing harder on later streets. \n\nI think check is the better play here. Take the free card, evaluate turn. If I hit my straight, great. If not, I can reassess. \n\nSo action: check. raise_to: null. Reasoning: I have a gutshot straight draw with J-high on a K-A-9 board. Opponent checked showing potential weakness, but betting out of position with a weak hand risks chips unnecessarily. Taking a free card to see if I hit my straight is the prudent play given my tournament chip stack is healthy.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand: #37**\n- My position: BB (Seat 3)\n- My cards: Js Td\n- My stack: 381 chips (95.2 BB)\n- Board: Kd Ad 9h 8s (turn)\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Opponent: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) with 298 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (opponent checked)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have Js Td on a board of Kd Ad 9h 8s. I have a straight draw - any Queen gives me a straight (Q gives me J-T-9-8-Q straight, but wait... actually I need a Queen for a straight? Let me think: Board is K-A-9-8. I have J-T. So my hand is J-T. For a straight, I need a Queen for J-T-Q-K-A (broadway) or a 7 for 7-8-9-T-J. So I have an open-ended straight draw with 8 outs (four 7s and four Qs). However, the board has two diamonds (Kd, Ad) but my Js Td includes the Td, so I have a backdoor flush draw with one diamond.\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nSeat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has shown:\n- Preflop: Raises (12 in hand 29), folds, calls, etc.\n- Postflop: In hand 29, they bet flop (18), checked turn and river with 99 on a 4-5-6-7-J board\n- In hand 33, they checked through all streets with weak hand\n- In hand 34, they checked through all streets with A8o on a 3-2-7-2-8 board\n\nThey seem to be a cautious player who checks when weak or when board is scary. Their check on the turn here could indicate weakness or a trap.\n\n**Pot odds and situation:**\nPot is 24 chips. I can check to see a free river, or bet for value/protection. With an open-ended straight draw (8 outs), I have about 17% chance to hit on the river (8/46 \u2248 17.4%). If I bet and get called, I need to consider implied odds.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack of 381 chips (95 BB). Opponent has 298 chips. I have position (acted last on turn). Checking gives me a free river card, which is good for my draw. Betting could get folds from weaker hands, but might also get raised by stronger hands.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that:\n1. I have a decent draw (open-ended straight, backdoor flush)\n2. Opponent checked twice (preflop raiser checked flop and turn, suggesting weakness)\n3. Pot is relatively small (24 chips)\n4. I have position\n\nI think checking is reasonable to see a free river. Betting could be good for protection if I think opponent has a weak hand that might outdraw me, but with my draw, I want to see the river cheaply. However, a small bet might also be good to build the pot if I hit.\n\nActually, let me think about opponent's range. They raised preflop from SB to 12 (3x BB). What could they have? Could be strong hands like AK, AQ, AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, or medium pairs, or suited connectors. The board has K-A-9-8 with two diamonds. They checked flop and turn. If they had top pair (AK) or two pair, they might bet. Their check suggests either a weak hand or a trap.\n\nGiven that I have position and a draw, checking seems fine. But a small bet could also work to apply pressure.\n\nActually, I should consider that if I check, opponent might bet river if they improve or if I miss. But I have position, so I can decide on river.\n\nI think I'll check to see the river for free. If I hit my straight, I can bet for value. If I miss, I can check or bluff depending on the river card.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking to see a free river with open-ended straight draw (8 outs).

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n- My hand: Js Td\n- Board: Kd Ad 9h 8s\n- I have an open-ended straight draw: I need a Q (for QJT98 straight) or a 7 (for JT987 straight). That's 8 outs.\n- Opponent (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised preflop from SB, then checked both flop and turn.\n- The pot is only 24 chips.\n- I have position on opponent.\n- My stack is 381 chips (95 BB), opponent has 298 chips.\n\nFrom the opponent history, they seem to be playing passively - mostly checking and calling. They raised preflop this hand (12 total), but then checked twice. This could indicate they have a hand like AK, AQ, or maybe a pocket pair that missed the flop.\n\nSince the pot is small and I have a strong draw, I could consider betting to try to win the pot now. However, betting might fold out weaker hands that I want to keep in the pot. Checking gives me a free river card with 8 outs (~16% chance to hit on river, ~32% chance from turn).\n\nGiven opponent's passive tendencies and the small pot size, checking seems reasonable to see a free river. If I hit my straight on the river, I can then bet for value.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that my hand has some showdown value if I don't hit - J high is weak, but opponent's checking suggests they might not have much either.\n\nActually, wait - I should think about this more carefully. The board is Kd Ad 9h 8s. There are flush draws possible (diamonds). My Js Td gives me a diamond draw too (Td). So I have additional equity with backdoor flush potential.\n\nBut the main consideration: checking is free, betting risks getting raised or called when I'm drawing. Since opponent raised preflop, they likely have at least some strength. Their turn check after checking flop could be a trap with a strong hand like two pair or a set.\n\nGiven the small pot and my position advantage, checking seems best. I'll take the free card and evaluate on the river.",

            "content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation:\n\nHand #37, I'm in BB with Js Td. Board: Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s. Pot: 24 chips. Opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has checked on the river. I have 381 chips (95.2 BB). Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand: Js Td gives me a straight draw that missed. Board has Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s. I have jack-high, no pair, no flush draw (I have Js but board has 4s, not enough for flush). Best possible hand is a straight with QJ, but I have JT, so I need a Q for a straight, but board already has K and A, so QJ would give me a straight to the Ace, but I don't have Q. Actually, wait: Board is Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s. With JT, I need a Q for a straight (QJ T 9 8). But no Q on board. So I have jack-high, no pair.\n\nOpponent's actions: preflop raise from SB to 12 (3x BB), I called from BB. Flop: Kd Ad 9h - opponent checked, I checked. Turn: 8s - opponent checked, I checked. River: 4s - opponent checked.\n\nOpponent likely has a weak hand that missed or a medium pair. They raised preflop from SB, which could be a wide range. Then checked flop, turn, and river. This suggests weakness. They might have missed completely or have a small pair.\n\nPot is 24 chips. If I bet, I could potentially take it down with a bluff. However, I have jack-high, which is very weak. But opponent has shown weakness throughout.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been fairly passive - checking and folding often. In hand #33, they checked river and then folded. In hand #34, they called preflop then checked all streets. In hand #35, they folded preflop. In hand #36, they checked and then folded on flop.\n\nThis opponent seems cautious and likely to fold to aggression.\n\nMy stack is healthy at 381 chips (95 BB). A small bet could win the 24 chip pot. If I get called, I lose, but risk is low.\n\nConsidering pot odds: If I bet 12 chips (half pot), I need opponent to fold more than 33% of the time to be profitable. Given opponent's passive tendencies, they might fold a lot.\n\nBut I should also consider that my hand has absolutely no showdown value. Jack-high will almost certainly lose if we go to showdown. So checking gives me 0% chance to win. Betting gives me some chance.\n\nHowever, I need to think about what hands opponent might have that they'd check three times. They raised preflop, so could have: medium pairs (TT, JJ, QQ?), suited connectors, broadway cards. Flop has K and A, which hit many of their raising range. Their check on flop could be cautious with a hand like QQ, JJ, TT, or maybe a weak ace. But then checking turn and river suggests they don't have a strong hand.\n\nThey might have a small pair like 77 or 66, or maybe a hand like QJ, QT, JT similar to mine. Or maybe a busted draw.\n\nGiven the board has two spades, but I have Js, so they can't have a flush with J-high. Flush would require 3 spades on board, but there are only 2 (8s and 4s).\n\nI think a small value bet/bluff is reasonable. But I need to decide amount. Minimum raise is 8 chips, but I can bet any amount from 4 to my stack.\n\nI could bet 12 chips (half pot) or 8 chips (minimum). Smaller bet more likely to get called by weak hands, larger bet more likely to get folds but costs more if called.\n\nGiven opponent's passivity, I think a small bet of 8-12 chips could work.\n\nLet me also consider tournament implications: I have a healthy stack, no need to take big risks. But this is a small pot relative to my stack.\n\nActually, wait: I'm in BB, opponent in SB. They raised preflop, which is standard for SB vs BB. Their range is wide. My call with JTo is marginal but okay from BB getting good odds.\n\nI think I'll bet small to try to take it down."

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation:\n\nHand #37, I'm in BB with Js Td. Board: Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s. Pot: 24 chips. Opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has checked on the river. I have 381 chips (95.2 BB). Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand: Js Td gives me a straight draw that missed. Board has Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s. I have jack-high, no pair, no flush draw (I have Js but board has 4s, not enough for flush). Best possible hand is a straight with QJ, but I have JT, so I need a Q for a straight, but board already has K and A, so QJ would give me a straight to the Ace, but I don't have Q. Actually, wait: Board is Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s. With JT, I need a Q for a straight (QJ T 9 8). But no Q on board. So I have jack-high, no pair.\n\nOpponent's actions: preflop raise from SB to 12 (3x BB), I called from BB. Flop: Kd Ad 9h - opponent checked, I checked. Turn: 8s - opponent checked, I checked. River: 4s - opponent checked.\n\nOpponent likely has a weak hand that missed or a medium pair. They raised preflop from SB, which could be a wide range. Then checked flop, turn, and river. This suggests weakness. They might have missed completely or have a small pair.\n\nPot is 24 chips. If I bet, I could potentially take it down with a bluff. However, I have jack-high, which is very weak. But opponent has shown weakness throughout.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been fairly passive - checking and folding often. In hand #33, they checked river and then folded. In hand #34, they called preflop then checked all streets. In hand #35, they folded preflop. In hand #36, they checked and then folded on flop.\n\nThis opponent seems cautious and likely to fold to aggression.\n\nMy stack is healthy at 381 chips (95 BB). A small bet could win the 24 chip pot. If I get called, I lose, but risk is low.\n\nConsidering pot odds: If I bet 12 chips (half pot), I need opponent to fold more than 33% of the time to be profitable. Given opponent's passive tendencies, they might fold a lot.\n\nBut I should also consider that my hand has absolutely no showdown value. Jack-high will almost certainly lose if we go to showdown. So checking gives me 0% chance to win. Betting gives me some chance.\n\nHowever, I need to think about what hands opponent might have that they'd check three times. They raised preflop, so could have: medium pairs (TT, JJ, QQ?), suited connectors, broadway cards. Flop has K and A, which hit many of their raising range. Their check on flop could be cautious with a hand like QQ, JJ, TT, or maybe a weak ace. But then checking turn and river suggests they don't have a strong hand.\n\nThey might have a small pair like 77 or 66, or maybe a hand like QJ, QT, JT similar to mine. Or maybe a busted draw.\n\nGiven the board has two spades, but I have Js, so they can't have a flush with J-high. Flush would require 3 spades on board, but there are only 2 (8s and 4s).\n\nI think a small value bet/bluff is reasonable. But I need to decide amount. Minimum raise is 8 chips, but I can bet any amount from 4 to my stack.\n\nI could bet 12 chips (half pot) or 8 chips (minimum). Smaller bet more likely to get called by weak hands, larger bet more likely to get folds but costs more if called.\n\nGiven opponent's passivity, I think a small bet of 8-12 chips could work.\n\nLet me also consider tournament implications: I have a healthy stack, no need to take big risks. But this is a small pot relative to my stack.\n\nActually, wait: I'm in BB, opponent in SB. They raised preflop, which is standard for SB vs BB. Their range is wide. My call with JTo is marginal but okay from BB getting good odds.\n\nI think I'll bet small to try to take it down.",

Opponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) is BB with 389 chips. He posted 4. So we are facing a call of 4 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise total to 8). Need to decide.\n\nWe have 2T offsuit, a weak hand. BTN is best position, but hand is low value. Should we fold? Consider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2's preflop raises amounts vary: 5,10,12,10,8,12,16,100,12. That suggests they raise sometimes bigger, maybe they are aggressive. But they are BB; they haven't raised yet, they just posted blind. So we are facing a call of 4. Our hand is weak, not a good candidate to steal. Could consider a raise to steal blinds, but 2T offsuit is not great for 3-bet; also stack is decent. Could attempt a squeeze if there were other raisers, but only SB posted 2 (no raise). So typical action: fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nReturn JSON.",

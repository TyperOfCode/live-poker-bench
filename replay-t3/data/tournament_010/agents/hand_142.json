In hand 134 they checked preflop from BB, suggesting they might defend their blind passively sometimes.\n\n**My Recent History:**\n- Hand 137: Won from BB with A8o (got walk)\n- Hand 138: Folded BTN with 35o\n- Hand 139: Folded BB to raise with 5J (faced 366 raise)\n- Hand 140: Folded BTN with J2o\n- Hand 141: Won from BB with K7o (got walk)\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm down to 7 BB - this is short stack territory\n- I need to start looking for spots to accumulate chips\n- BTN is the best position to steal blinds\n- J9o is a decent hand for a steal attempt\n- The BB has 398 chips (6.2 BB), so they're also short\n\n**Decision:**\nWith 7 BB and J9o on the button facing only a BB, this is a good spot to steal. J9o is ahead of random hands and I have position. The BB is also short stacked which might make them less likely to defend without a real hand.\n\nI could:\n1. Fold - too tight, I need chips\n2. Call - not great, I'm out of position postflop if they defend\n3. Raise - good for stealing, puts pressure on short-stacked BB\n\nGiven I'm on the button with a short stack and a reasonable hand, I should raise to steal. Minimum raise is 128 chips, which would leave me with 320 chips (5 BB) if called and I lose. That's a good risk/reward ratio.\n\nI'll raise to 128 chips.",

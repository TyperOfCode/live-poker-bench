Wait actions: Seat5 post_sb 32, seat1 post_bb 64. So we are small blind, not button? But position says BTN (Seat5). However they posted SB, maybe they are SB and also button? In heads-up? Actually many players have 0 chips, so only two players left: seat5 (us) and seat1 (Kimi-K2) with 512 chips. So we are SB and also button (since only two players). So we are first to act preflop after posting SB, facing BB 64. Amount to call 32 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., total bet 128). So we have 8h5d, very weak. Short stack 5 BB, we could consider shove (all-in) or call? All-in would be 334 chips, which is 5.2 BB. That's a big overbet relative to pot; but we are short. However 8-5 offsuit is terrible. Better to fold and preserve chips. Call 32 would be just to see flop, but with such weak hand, not worth. Raising is not advisable.\n\nThus fold. Reason: weak hand, short stack, cannot profitably shove, better to preserve chips.\n\nReturn JSON.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: Th Ks (King of spades, Ten of hearts) - This is KTo, a decent but not premium hand. It's offsuit, which reduces its value.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position postflop.\n\n3. **My stack**: 576 chips (9.0 BB) - This is a short stack, but not desperate yet. I have 9 big blinds.\n\n4. **Opponent**: Only one active opponent left (Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B) with 270 chips (about 4.2 BB). This is a very short stack.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 to win 96 (3:1 odds), which is very good.\n\n6. **Situation**: \n   - Everyone else has folded\n   - It's heads-up against the BB\n   - The BB has a very short stack (270 chips)\n   - I have position\n\nGiven that my opponent has only 270 chips (4.2 BB), they're very short-stacked. With KTo on the button, this is a strong enough hand to play against such a short stack. \n\nI should consider:\n- Raising to put pressure on the short stack\n- The opponent might be desperate and could shove with a wide range\n- With 9 BB, I could also just call and see a flop, but a raise might be better to take control\n\nLet me think about the raise size. Minimum raise is 128. If I raise to 128:\n- The pot becomes 224\n- Opponent has 270-64 = 206 left\n- They would be getting about 2.5:1 on a shove\n\nActually, given the opponent's very short stack, I should either:\n1. Raise to a size that puts them all-in or close to it\n2. Just call and see a flop\n\nWith KTo on the button against a 4 BB stack, this is a clear raise situation. I want to apply pressure and potentially take down the pot preflop or get called by worse hands.\n \nA strategic raise to 128 chips sets up a compelling scenario. If my opponent calls, the pot grows to 256, leaving them with 206 chips. This creates an interesting dynamic where they'll have just over 80% of the pot remaining, which could force a difficult decision on their part. The raise puts significant pressure on their short stack while maintaining my positional advantage.\n\nI'm carefully weighing the risks and potential outcomes. While pushing all-in is an option, a standard raise seems more nuanced against an opponent who has already invested in the big blind. My 9 BB stack allows for strategic flexibility, making a calculated raise the most prudent move.\n\nThe key is balancing aggression with preservation, using my positional advantage to potentially extract value or force a fold without unnecessarily risking my entire tournament life.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have pocket deuces (2s 2d) in BB with 4.2 BB stack (270 chips). The pot is 192 already (SB 32, BB 64, raise 128 = total 224? Wait compute: SB posts 32, BB posts 64 = 96. Then SB raises to 128, meaning adds 96 more (since already 32 posted). So total pot = 96 + 128 = 224? Actually after raise, total contributions: SB 128, BB 64 = 192. Yes pot is 192 as given. Amount to call is 64 (to match 128). Minimum raise to 192 (i.e., raise by at least 128 more). Stack 270, can raise to 192 (i.e., add 128). That would be a total bet of 192 from BB, leaving 78 chips left (270-192). That's a raise to 192 total (so raise amount is 128). Pocket pair low, deep? Actually shallow stack, 4.2 BB, so it's a shove or call? Raising to 192 would be about 3 BB (since 192/64=3). That's a big raise, leaving 78 chips, about 1.2 BB left. Could also go all-in for 270. With pocket deuces, we have a set chance if call, but against a raise from SB (likely a strong hand). With 4.2 BB, we could consider shoving all-in (270) to maximize fold equity? But opponent likely raising with a wide range from SB (maybe 3-betting?). Actually SB is the only opponent left; they raised from SB. In BB we have a small pocket pair; we can consider calling (i.e., just match 64) to see flop cheap. But we are deep short; calling 64 leaves 206 chips left, about 3.2 BB. Could be okay. But we need to consider pot odds: call 64 to win 192+64=256? Actually pot before call is 192, we call 64, pot becomes 256. So pot odds = 64/256 = 0.25. Need >25% equity. Pocket deuces vs unknown range? Likely opponent's raise range includes many higher cards; pocket deuces maybe ~5% equity preflop vs typical raise range (maybe 30% of hands). So not enough. So folding is likely best.\n\nBut we could also consider a shove to get fold equity, but with such short stack, raising to 192 (not all-in) may be less effective; opponent could call or re-raise. Better to go all-in? All-in 270 vs opponent's 128 raise; they'd need to call 270? Actually they'd need to call 270-128 = 142 more. That's a big call; they might fold many hands. But with only 4.2 BB, a shove might be okay. However we have low pair; we want to maximize equity by seeing flop cheap, but we have low stack. I think best is to fold.\n\nCheck legal actions: fold, call, raise. We'll choose fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

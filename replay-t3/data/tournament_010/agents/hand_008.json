They seem capable of raising with a range of hands.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- TJo is a decent but not great hand\n- It's offsuit, which reduces its value\n- From BB, I'm getting 2:1 pot odds (calling 2 to win 7)\n- However, I'll be out of position postflop\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (186 BB)\n- Calling 2 chips is cheap relative to my stack\n- However, playing out of position with a marginal hand can be tricky\n\n**Decision:** The pot odds are good (2 to win 7 = 28% equity needed), and TJo likely has enough equity against MiniMax-M2's raising range. However, being out of position makes this a marginal spot. \n\nLet me consider raising. A 3-bet would be to at least 6 chips (minimum raise). But with TJo offsuit and out of position, this seems too aggressive. \n\nFolding seems too tight given the good pot odds and deep stack.\n\nI think the best play is to call and see a flop in position. Wait, I'm actually OUT of position as the BB. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, looking at it again - I'm the BB (Seat 1), so I act first on all postflop streets. This is a disadvantageous position.\n\nWith TJo offsuit and out of position, even though the pot odds are good, I should be cautious. However, the raise is only to 4 total (2 more to call), which is a min-raise. Against this small sizing, and given my deep stack, I think calling is acceptable.\n\nLet me make the call.",

The flop is checked to me (amount to call is 0).\n\n**Hand analysis**:\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (I need a K to make a straight: T-J-Q-K)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (one club)\n- The board is paired (9s), which reduces the value of my straight draw\n- My hand is currently very weak with no pair\n\n**Opponent analysis** (MiniMax-M2 from Seat 4):\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 3: Checked down all streets (showed weakness)\n- Hand 5: Raised preflop to 4, called a 3-bet to 10, called flop bet of 15, then made a big turn bet of 74 (showing aggression with value or strong draw)\n\nThe preflop raise to 4 is consistent with their pattern. They could have a wide range here including pocket pairs, Qx hands, suited connectors, etc.\n\n**Pot odds**: Not applicable since it's checked to me - I can see a free card.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n1. I have a weak draw on a paired board\n2. I'm out of position\n3. I can check and see a free card\n4. If I bet, I might fold out some weaker hands but I'm building a pot with a marginal hand\n5. The board has a flush draw (clubs) that I could represent if I bet\n\nGiven that I have a gutshot on a paired board (which is very weak), I'm out of position, and I can see a free card, the best play is to check. There's no value in betting here - I don't have a strong hand, and if my opponent has a Q or 9, I'm drawing very thin. If they have nothing, they might fold, but I'm better off checking and seeing if I can improve on the turn.\n\nThe only argument for betting would be to represent the flush draw or to try to take down the pot now, but with such a small pot relative to stacks, it's not worth the risk.\n\nI should check and see the free card.",

The bet on the flop could be:\n1. A continuation bet with air\n2. A made hand (Q, 9, or pocket pair)\n3. A flush draw\n4. A straight draw\n\nGiven the small bet size (6 into 15), this looks like either:\n- A standard continuation bet\n- A probe bet with a marginal hand\n- A small bet with a strong hand trying to keep me in\n\n**My decision:**\nI have a decent draw but:\n1. The board is paired, reducing my straight value\n\n\n2. There's a flush draw that could beat me\n3. I'm out of position\n4. I don't have enough equity to call based on pot odds alone\n5. The opponent has shown they can make big bets when they have it\n\nI'll fold this hand to avoid potential trap scenarios.

This hand is definitely not strong enough to open-raise from UTG.\n\nStandard poker strategy: From UTG, you should play tight, maybe top 10-15% of hands. T2s is way outside that range.

No need to gamble with marginal hands.\n\nPot odds: Calling 2 chips to win 3 (1.5:1 pot odds). But postflop I'll be out of position against the entire table, which is terrible with a weak hand.\n\nI should fold. But let me check if there's any history that might change my decision.

Need decision.\n\nWe should consider opponent's tendencies: from recall, MiniMax-M2's raises: hand 5 preflop raise 4 (small raise). Hand 5 later called 10 (postflop). Hand 2 river raise 24 (aggressive). Hand 5 turn bet 74 (big). So seems they can be aggressive, but also sometimes just call.\n\nOur hand 4J offsuit is weak. In SB facing a raise from UTG? Actually seat 4 is MP? Table seats: seat 1 Kimi-K2 (BB), seat 3 DeepSeek folded, seat 4 MiniMax-M2 (raised). Position: SB is after BB, before UTG? Actually SB is seat5, BB seat1, so seat4 is MP? Not sure. But we are out of position postflop.\n\nGiven weak hand, fold is typical. Could consider call if implied odds, but 4J is low suited, not good. Opponent's raise size is 4 (2 big blinds). Pot after raise: 7+1+2+4? Actually pot currently 7 (blinds). SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then raise to 4 (so total contributions: SB 1, BB 2, raise 4 => total 7? Actually raise means they added 2 more? But amount to call 3 suggests raise to 4 total, meaning they put 4 total, so added 2 more beyond BB. So pot now 1+2+4 =7, plus the call amount 3 would make pot 10. Not great.\n\nThus fold.\n\nWe should maybe recall opponent's range: raise to 4 is small, maybe wide. But still 4J not strong.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

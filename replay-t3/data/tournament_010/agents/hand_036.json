            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 3c 9d - This is a very weak hand. It's offsuit, low cards, not connected, and has no straight or flush potential.\n\n**Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is good position postflop.\n\n**Stack**: 310 chips (77.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Pot is 10 chips (2 from SB, 4 from BB, 4 from MiniMax-M2's call)\n- MiniMax-M2 called 4 chips from seat 4\n- I have the option to check (free) or raise\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Hand 35: Called preflop 10, then called 20 on flop, bet 20 on turn, called 60, bet 60 on river - seems like a calling station or someone with a strong hand\n- Hand 32: Raised to 8 preflop, called 16 more, called 30 on flop - aggressive with raises\n- Hand 31: Called 2 preflop, bet 4 on turn - mixed play\n- Hand 30: Bet 8 on flop, checked turn then called 8, bet 66 on river - aggressive on river\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems to be an active player who bets and calls frequently. They have a short stack of only 27 chips (6.75 BB), which is very short.\n\n**Decision**: With 3c 9d this is a trash hand. I should:\n1. Check and see a free flop - this costs me nothing and I have position\n2. Even though MiniMax-M2 has a short stack, raising with 3c 9d is not profitable long-term\n3. The pot is only 10 chips, not worth fighting for with this hand\n4. If I raise, I could get re-raised and have to fold, or get called and be in a tough spot postflop\n\nThe best play is to check and see the flop for free. There's no value in raising with this hand, and checking gives me a chance to hit something (though unlikely) or bluff later if the situation is right.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current hand situation:**\n- I'm in BB (big blind) with 3c 9d\n- Board: Ah 9s 8d\n- Pot: 14 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) bet 4 on the flop\n- I need to call 4 to continue\n- I have a pair of 9s (bottom pair)\n\n**Key considerations:**\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have bottom pair with a weak kicker (9d). The board is Ah 9s 8d. This is a dangerous board with:\n   - An Ace (could be top pair for opponent)\n   - Straight draw possibilities (JT, T7, 76)\n   - Backdoor flush draw for diamonds\n\n2. **Opponent analysis**: MiniMax-M2 has been quite active and aggressive. Looking at the recent actions:\n   - Hand 35: Called preflop, checked flop, called 20, bet 20 on turn, called 60, bet 60 on river (showing aggression)\n   - Hand 32: Raised preflop, called large bet on flop (30), then checked turn and river\n   - Hand 30: Bet 8 on flop, checked turn, called 8, bet 66 on river\n   \n   This player seems to bet frequently and doesn't give up easily. They also make large river bets.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm out of position which is a disadvantage\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 14, I need to call 4. That's 3.5:1 odds, which is good.\n\n5. **Stack sizes**: I have 310 chips (77.5 BB), opponent has only 23 chips (very short stack). They've bet 4, leaving them with 19 chips.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: We're in a tournament, and there's a very short stack at the table (MiniMax-M2 with 23 chips). They could be desperate.\n\n**Decision analysis:**\n\n**If I call:**\n- I'm risking 4 chips to win 18 (current pot + opponent's bet)\n- I have bottom pair which is vulnerable\n- The opponent is aggressive and could have:\n  - An Ace (top pair)\n  - A better 9 (kicker)\n  - A straight draw\n  - A flush draw\n  - Or could be bluffing with nothing\n  \n- If I call and hit my 9 (making trips), I could win a lot\n- If I call and don't improve, I'm likely behind if opponent has an Ace or better hand\n\n**If I fold:**\n- I lose nothing more\n- I preserve my chips\n- The board is very coordinated and dangerous\n\n**If I raise:**\n- Minimum raise is to 8\n- Opponent only has 23 chips total, so a raise could force them all-in\n- But with bottom pair and weak kicker, this is too risky\n\n**Conclusion:** While the pot odds are good, my hand is very weak. I have bottom pair with a terrible kicker on an Ace-high board with straight and flush draws possible. The opponent is aggressive and could easily have an Ace or be drawing. \n\nThe risk of continuing with such a weak hand outweighs the pot odds. I should fold and wait for a better spot, especially since I'm out of position and the opponent is short-stacked and aggressive.",

Stack: 31 chips (7.8 BB) - short stacked\n4. Current action: I need to call 4 chips to see the flop\n5. Minimum raise would be to 8 chips total\n\nLooking at my recent history from the BTN:\n- I've been playing relatively tight from BTN (37% win rate)\n- Recent hands show I've been folding weaker hands and calling with decent hands\n- In hand #32, I had QdTh and raised preflop but lost at showdown\n- I have a tendency to be aggressive when I have good cards\n\nLooking at opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1):\n- Has 310 chips (big stack)\n- Recent preflop actions show mostly folding, with some calls and one raise\n- From the showdown info, I can see they've played hands like 99s, As8h, 98s\n- They seem to be playing reasonably tight but will call with decent hands\n\nAnalysis:\n- Q\u26659\u2665 is a decent hand, especially suited\n- I'm in position on the button\n- I'm short stacked at 7.8 BB\n- The pot is already 6 chips (1.5 BB), so getting involved makes sense\n- Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot lately, so they might fold to a raise\n- With my stack size, I need to be careful about getting too committed\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have a decent suited connector\n2. I'm in position \n3. I'm short stacked and need to accumulate chips\n4. The opponent has been folding frequently\n5. I can see the flop cheaply for 4 chips (1 BB)\n\nI think calling is the best option here. I can see the flop cheaply and potentially make draws or pairs. If I raise to 8 chips, I'd be committing about 25% of my stack preflop, which might be too much with Q9o.\n\n\nThe pot odds are appealing, allowing me to explore the flop with minimal risk.

The raise serves two purposes:\n\n\nI'll capitalize on the opponent's predictable behavior by forcing a fold with a well-timed bluff. The low-cost raise leverages my positional advantage and flush draw potential, targeting Kimi-K2's tendency to avoid confrontation. By pushing 4 chips, I create an opportunity to win the pot immediately or improve my hand with minimal risk.\n",

Actually order: Seat5 SB, then seat1 BB, then seat2 (empty), seat3 folded, seat4 is after seat3, so seat4 is UTG? Anyway seat4 called 4 (so they are in the pot). So we have SB posted 2, facing a call from seat4 of 4, and BB posted 4. So pot now 2+4+4+4 (SB posted 2, BB 4, seat4 call 4) = 14? Wait initial pot 10 chips (blinds). Then SB posted 2 (makes pot 12), BB posted 4 (makes pot 14), seat4 call 4 (makes pot 18). Actually the actions list: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 2, Seat1 post_bb 4, Seat3 fold, Seat4 call 4. So seat4 called the big blind (4) meaning they put 4 chips. So total chips in pot: 2+4+4 =10? Wait the blinds themselves are 2 and 4, which are part of pot 10 initially. Then seat5 posted sb 2 (that's already included?), Actually blinds are posted before hand, pot is 6 (2+4). But they say pot: 10 chips. Might include some antes? Not needed. Anyway amount to call: 2 (we need to call the BB's 4? Actually we are SB, we posted 2, the BB posted 4, seat4 called 4, so we need to call 2 more to match the 4? Yes amount to call is 2. Minimum raise to 8.\n\nGiven hand 8h3s is very weak, likely fold. Consider tournament stage? Stack 63.5 BB, still decent. Opponent tendencies unknown. But we can check opponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) stack 27 chips, short stack. Might be trying to steal? But we are SB, out of position, hand is terrible. So fold.\n\nThus JSON: action fold, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

It's not suited, doesn't have connectedness (gap between 5 and 6), and low cards that don't make strong pairs.\n\n**Opponent analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see that GPT-OSS-120B:\n- Folds most preflop (hands 67, 69, 70, 71, 73, 74)\n- Made a similar 48 chip raise in hand 68\n- Called in hand 76 (which was likely from BB with a small amount)\n- Bet on the turn in hand 76\n\nThis suggests they play relatively tight but are capable of making raises. The 48 chip raise seems to be their standard raise size.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 40 to win 72, giving me 1.8:1 odds. This is not enough to call with 5-6 offsuit.\n\n**Position:** I'm in SB, which is the worst position postflop. I'll be acting first on every street.\n\n**Stack size:** I have 22.2 BB, which is in the mid-stack range. I should be selective with my hands and not risk chips unnecessarily.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With a medium stack, I should preserve chips for better spots. 5-6 offsuit from SB is not a hand worth defending with.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, I'm out of position, and the pot odds don't justify a call. I should save my chips for better opportunities.",

Their raising pattern seems to be around 48 chips when they do raise\n\nNow let me analyze my situation:\n- I'm in the big blind with Kh 5d\n- I have 262 chips (16.4 BB)\n- There's 72 chips in the pot\n- I need to call 32 to see the flop\n- Minimum raise would be to 80 total\n\nMy hand Kh 5d is quite weak. King-high with a 5 kicker is not a strong hand, especially when it's offsuit. I'm facing a raise from an opponent who has been raising somewhat frequently but also folding a lot.\n\nLet me think about the math:\n- I'm getting pot odds of 72:32 = 2.25:1\n- This means I need about 30.7% equity to call profitably\n- King-high offsuit is typically around 25-30% equity against a random hand\n- But against a raising range, it's probably less\n\nGiven that:\n1. My hand is weak\n2. I'm out of position \n3. The opponent has been raising somewhat frequently\n4. I have a decent stack (16.4 BB) that I want to preserve in a tournament\n5. I'm getting decent pot odds but my hand strength doesn't justify calling\n\nI think this is a clear fold. The Kh 5d is too weak to continue against a raise, especially when I'm out of position.\n",

Qs and 9h: not suited). So Q9 offsuit is marginal. Position button, can steal blinds. Opponents: Seat1 Kimi-K2 is SB with 356 chips, Seat4 MiniMax-M2 is BB with 262 chips. Both have some raise tendencies: Kimi-K2 raised 14 (maybe 1.75x) and 6 (maybe 0.75x) preflop in past. MiniMax-M2 raises varied: small raises 4 (maybe 0.5x), 8, 28, 32. So both can raise small.\n\nWe are on button with 19.8 BB, need to consider tournament: relatively short stack but not crisis. Steal attempt could be good. Q9 offsuit is not premium but can be used for steal. Risk: if called, we may be dominated by better hands. However, both opponents have stacks: SB 356 (22.25 BB), BB 262 (16.4 BB). If we raise to 48 (3x BB), they'd need to call. Could be fold.\n\nBut we have only 19.8 BB, raising to 48 would be 3BB, leaving 268 chips. That's okay. Minimum raise is 32 (2 BB). Raise to 48 is a 3x raise.\n\nConsider equity vs typical calling range. If they call with any pair, broadway, suited connectors, they have equity >50. Q9 offsuit vs that is low. But maybe they fold often.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe better to just call and see flop? But calling 16 will commit half stack. That seems risky.\n\nBetter to raise to 48 (3x) as steal. If called, we can evaluate flop; but we will be out of position preflop? Actually we will be first to act after flop (SB first). But we are button, after raise, action goes to SB then BB. If they call, we will be out of position.\n\nGiven Q9 offsuit, maybe we should just fold? But we have 19.8 BB, folding loses 16 chips (blinds) and we keep stack. Could be okay.\n\nBut typical button steal range includes Q9o? Many players raise with Q9o. So raise.\n\nThus decision: raise to 48 (or maybe 48 is max? Minimum raise is 32, we can raise to 48). Let's raise to 48.\n\nReasoning: attempt to steal blinds, hand decent, short stack, opponents have shown tendency to raise small but also fold to raises.\n\nReturn JSON.",

This is a short stack, but not yet in the \"push/fold\" zone where I absolutely must shove. However, I need to be very selective with my hands.\n\n4. **Pot**: 96 chips (1.5 BB)\n   - I need to call 32 to see the flop (getting 3:1 odds)\n\n5. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B has 270 chips, has been folding a lot preflop (7 folds out of 10 recent hands), but has raised twice to 238 chips. This suggests they play tight but make big raises with strong hands.\n\n**Decision Analysis**:\n- With 85o, this is a clear fold in almost any situation\n- Even on the button, this hand has terrible equity against any reasonable range\n- My stack is short at 9 BB, so I need to preserve chips for better spots\n- The opponent in BB seems to play tight (lots of folds), but when they raise it's significant\n- The pot odds (3:1) are not enough to justify calling with this garbage hand\n- I should wait for a better hand or situation to commit my chips\n\nThis is a trivial fold. I don't need to risk 5.5% of my stack on 85o.",

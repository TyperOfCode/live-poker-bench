We have no clubs, so flush possible for opponent. We have gutshot? Actually we have a straight draw? Board: 2,4,9,10. We have 8,2. Could make straight 6-7-8-9-10? Need 6 and 7, not there. So not. So we have a pair of twos (top pair? No, 2c on board, we have 2h, so we have second pair, but board also has 2c, so we have a pair but opponent could have 2x for trips. Also board is heavily clubbed; any club gives flush. Also there is a possible straight? Not really. So our hand is weak.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) checked on turn. So they didn't bet. Preflop they called small blind? Actually preflop: seat4 (MiniMax) posted sb 1, then called 1 after BB posted 2? Wait preflop: seat4 post_sb 1, seat5 post_bb 2, seat4 call 1 (so they called sb, making 2 total). So they are in the pot with 2 chips each. Flop: both checked. Turn: MiniMax checked. So they are checking again. Could be weak, could be drawing, could be trapped.\n\nOur stack is 198 chips, pot is currently? Let's calculate: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, then SB called 1, so total 4? Actually SB posted 1, BB posted 2, SB called 1 (so adds 1 more). So total after preflop = 1+2+1 =4. Flop: both checked, pot remains 4. Turn: MiniMax checked, we have amount to call 0, pot remains 4. Minimum raise to 2 (so raise to 2). So we can check or raise to 2.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, and opponent checked, likely they have nothing or a draw. Raising could be a bluff, but we have short stack? Actually we have 198 chips (99 BB). So deep. Raising 2 is tiny, not much. Could check and see river. River card unknown yet. River could be club (flush possible for opponent), could be 8 to give us two pair? Actually board will be 5 cards: currently 4 clubs, plus river. If river is club, opponent could have flush. If river is 8, we get trips? Actually we have 8h, board no 8, so we would have pair of 8s plus pair of 2s? Actually we have 8h, board 8? No board doesn't have 8. So we would have one pair of 2s (our 2h with board 2c). Not strong. If river is 2, we get trips? Actually board already has 2c, we have 2h, so if river is 2, we have trips (three 2s). That would be strong.\n\nGiven the board is heavily clubbed, opponent might have a club. Checking could indicate they have a draw but not strong enough to bet. Could be they have a flush already? If they have flush they'd likely bet. So maybe they have a weak hand. We could try to steal pot with a small raise. But raising only 2 chips into pot 4 is not much, could be considered a value bet? Might not be effective.\n\nWe could check and see river, then decide. Since we have weak hand, better to check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. There's no bet to call, so folding is nonsense. So check.\n\nThus decision: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on river. Situation: BB with 8h 2h. Board: Tc 2c 9c 4c Td. So board has: Tc, 2c, 9c, 4c, Td. That's two pair? Actually board: Tc, 2c, 9c, 4c, Td => there are two tens (Tc, Td) and two clubs? Actually clubs: Tc, 2c, 9c, 4c are clubs, plus Td (diamond? Wait Td is ten of diamonds). So board: Ten of clubs, Two of clubs, Nine of clubs, Four of clubs, Ten of diamonds. So board is a flush draw but not completed: there are four clubs on board, but we have 8h 2h (both hearts). No club in hand. So opponent (MiniMax-M2) could have a club for a flush. Also board has pair of tens. Our hand: 8h 2h gives us a pair of twos (we have a 2 in hand matching board 2c). Actually board has a 2c, we have 2h, so we have a pair of twos (two pair? Actually board also has two tens, so board is two pair (tens and clubs? Wait clubs not a pair). Board: Tc, 2c, 9c, 4c, Td. That's pair of tens (Tc and Td). So board is already a pair of tens. Our 2h gives us a pair of twos, making us have two pair: tens and twos (but the tens are on board, we have no extra ten). Actually we have a pair of twos, but the board already has a ten pair, so our hand is two pair? Let's evaluate: Best five-card hand we can make from board + our hand: we can use the board's two tens, the board's 2c, and our 2h, plus the highest other card (9c). So we have two pair: tens and twos, kicker 9. Opponent could have a better hand: they could have a ten (making trips), could have a flush (any club), could have a straight? Board: T, 2, 9, 4, T. Straight possibilities: A 5? Not. No straight possible with board. Could have a full house? If opponent has a ten, they'd have three tens plus a pair (maybe 2s if they have a 2). If they have a club, they'd have flush (since four clubs on board, any club gives flush). If they have 2c? Already on board. So opponent's check on river indicates they likely have nothing strong, maybe missed draw. Our hand is currently second best to flush or trips. Since pot is only 4 chips, we have 198 stack, but we are in BB with 8h2h which is weak. Opponent checked. We can check back, no need to raise. Raising could be a bluff to try to win extra chips, but risk opponent calling with a flush? However opponent just checked, likely they have no club or ten. Could be a weak hand like Ace high, they may fold to a raise. But we have very weak hand, but also we have a decent showdown value: two pair vs many possible combos. The pot is tiny (4 chips). Raising could win extra chips if opponent folds, but also risk losing if they call with better hand. Since we have big stack relative to pot, we could attempt a small raise to steal? Minimum raise is 2. So raise to 2 (i.e., total 2). That would be a raise of 2 chips (since amount to call is 0). That would be a 2 chip bet. Opponent could call 2 chips. If they have a flush they'd call, we lose 2 chips. Not huge. Might be okay to raise as a semi-bluff? But we have no backdoor outs. However it's the river, no further betting. So raising is just to win extra chips. Since pot is 4, raising to 2 gives us pot odds? Actually we are betting 2 to win 4, 2:4 = 0.5 ratio. If opponent calls with any better hand, we lose 2. Might be acceptable. But also we could just check, get the 4 chips. I think best is check. Reason: we have a marginal hand; opponent checked, likely weak; raising could be unnecessary risk; also we want to preserve chips. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We'll check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Hand 2 river raise 24 (aggressive). Hand 5 turn bet 74 (big). So seems they can be aggressive, but also sometimes just call.\n\nOur hand 4J offsuit is weak. In SB facing a raise from UTG? Actually seat 4 is MP? Table seats: seat 1 Kimi-K2 (BB), seat 3 DeepSeek folded, seat 4 MiniMax-M2 (raised). Position: SB is after BB, before UTG? Actually SB is seat5, BB seat1, so seat4 is MP? Not sure. But we are out of position postflop.\n\nGiven weak hand, fold is typical. Could consider call if implied odds, but 4J is low suited, not good. Opponent's raise size is 4 (2 big blinds). Pot after raise: 7+1+2+4? Actually pot currently 7 (blinds). SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then raise to 4 (so total contributions: SB 1, BB 2, raise 4 => total 7? Actually raise means they added 2 more? But amount to call 3 suggests raise to 4 total, meaning they put 4 total, so added 2 more beyond BB. So pot now 1+2+4 =7, plus the call amount 3 would make pot 10. Not great.\n\nThus fold.\n\nWe should maybe recall opponent's range: raise to 4 is small, maybe wide. But still 4J not strong.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need decide action preflop in BB with Kh4h. Stack 190, blinds 1/2, pot 3. Opponent seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 367 chips, presumably in SB? Actually seat1 posted SB 1, seat5 posted BB 2. So seat1 is SB, seat5 BB. So we are in BB facing a raise? Actually amount to call is 1 (SB posted 1, BB posted 2). So after SB posted 1, BB posted 2 (forced). So now action is after SB? Actually order preflop: SB posts 1, BB posts 2, then action goes to UTG (seat2) but seat2 is folded, seat3 folded, seat4 folded, so it's back to SB (seat1) who can raise or check. The amount to call is 1 (meaning SB's raise? Actually SB posted 1, to call we need to match SB's bet? But SB already posted 1. The amount to call 1 likely means SB raised to 3? Wait minimum raise to is 4. That suggests current bet is 2? Let's interpret: BB posted 2, SB posted 1, then action goes to SB, they can raise. The amount to call is 1 (meaning to call the BB's 2? Actually from BB perspective, amount to call is 1 meaning SB has raised to 3? No, typical: After forced blinds, action starts with UTG, but since everyone folded, SB is first to act. If SB checks, then BB can check. But amount to call 1 suggests SB has raised to 3? Let's compute: BB posted 2, SB posted 1. If SB raises to 4 (minimum raise to 4), then amount to call for BB would be 4-2 =2? Not 1. If SB raises to 3 (just a raise of 1 over BB?), but minimum raise to is 4, so can't raise to 3. Actually minimum raise to is 4 meaning the total bet must be at least 4. So SB could raise to 4, which is a raise of 2 over BB's 2. Then BB would need to call 2. But amount to call shown is 1, so perhaps the action is after SB checked, and now BB can check (call 0) or raise. But amount to call 1? Hmm.\n\nMaybe the system defines amount to call as the amount needed to call the current bet (which is SB's 1). Since BB already posted 2, they are \"overcalled\"? Actually BB posted 2, which is bigger than SB's 1, so BB is already ahead. In that case, amount to call is 0 (BB can check). But they show amount to call 1, maybe they treat BB as needing to call SB's 1 to match? But BB posted 2, which is bigger, so they are already ahead. However maybe they treat the BB's forced blind as not counting toward call? Usually you can check in BB if SB checks. So amount to call should be 0. But given amount to call 1, maybe SB raised to 3 (so BB must call 1 more). Minimum raise to 4 indicates SB raised to 3 (bet 3) is allowed? Minimum raise to 4 suggests the current bet is 3, so raising must go to at least 4. So amount to call = 3 - 2 =1. Yes that fits: SB raised to 3 (total bet). That's a raise of 1 over BB's 2, but minimum raise is 2 (to 4). But maybe the system allows raise of 1? Hmm contradictory.\n\nNevertheless, we have to decide action: we have Kh4h, a weak hand, suited but low kicker. In BB facing a raise from SB (likely small raise), we should probably fold or call? With 95 BB stack, calling 1 chip is cheap. But hand is weak, not good for post-flop. However could see cheap flop. In tournament early stage, preserving chips is not critical but still. Typically you would fold K4 offsuit (unsuited) but it's suited hearts, but still weak. Many players fold K4 suited in BB vs raise. Since raise is minimal (maybe 3 total), calling 1 extra is cheap. Could also consider raising to isolate, but not strong enough.\n\nThus fold is safe. But maybe we can call to see flop cheap. Let's consider opponent: Kimi-K2 Thinking unknown tendencies. Could be tight? Not known. With 190 chips, we have 95 BB, deep enough. I think fold is reasonable.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. I'll choose fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

So we have top pair (Jack) with a gutshot straight draw (10) and a backdoor flush draw (diamonds). Also we have a pair of Jacks, but opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) is the only remaining player (Seat 3). He checked to us on flop. Pot 71. He is in BB (seat3). Preflop action: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, Seat4 called 2, we called 2, then SB folded, BB raise 10, Seat4 call 8, we raise to 30, BB call 20. So preflop we raised and got called by BB, pot 71 includes blinds etc.\n\nNow flop: BB checked. We have top pair with decent kicker (9). Opponent's range likely includes Aces, Jacks, maybe 7x, maybe 8-9 combos, maybe straight draws, etc. He checked, maybe weak or trap. We can consider betting for value and protection. Our stack 160, we have 71 in pot, we have 130 remaining after our call? Actually we have 160 total, we have invested preflop: 2 (call) + 30 raise = 32? Actually we called 2, raised to 30 (so additional 28), total 30? Wait raise to 30 includes the 2 call? Preflop: we called 2, then raise to 30 (so we put total 30). So we have 160-30 =130 left. Pot 71 includes our 30, opponent's 20 call, plus others? Let's compute: SB 1, BB 2, Seat4 call 2, we call 2, then BB raise 10 (total 12?), Wait timeline: SB post 1, BB post 2, Seat4 call 2 (so puts 2), Seat5 call 2 (we call 2). SB fold. BB raise 10 (so adds 10 more, making his total 12). Seat4 call 8 (makes his total 10?). Actually seat4 had 2, call 8 = total 10. Then we raise to 30 (so we add 20 more beyond our 2). BB call 20 (makes his total 32). So pot after preflop: SB 1 (folded), BB 32, Seat4 10, us 30 = 73? plus maybe some? The pot listed as 71, close enough.\n\nNow flop: opponent checked, amount to call 0. Minimum raise 20. Legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nWe should consider betting. With top pair, decent kicker, we want value from weaker Jacks (like Jx) and maybe Ace. Also protect against draws. So raise is appropriate.\n\nSize: Pot 71, typical raise 2.5-3x pot for value. But we have 130 left, could raise to say 100 (total). Minimum raise is 20 (to 90? Wait raise_to is total amount we put in? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in, not additional. So if we raise to 90, we would be adding 90-30? Actually our current contribution to pot is 30 preflop, but on flop we haven't contributed yet. The raise_to amount is total amount we are putting in this street? Usually raise_to is total bet amount. So we need to set raise_to maybe 70 (i.e., bet 70). But the raise must be at least 20 (minimum raise to 20). The pot is 71, so a raise to 71+20=91? Actually minimum raise is current bet (0) + min raise amount (20) = 20. So we can bet any amount >=20. Usually we bet like 50-70.\n\nGiven stack 130, we could bet 80 (to 80). That would be about 1.1x pot. Could also bet 100 (1.4x pot). Considering opponent's range includes Aces, they may call with Ace high? Might fold. Might also have Jacks, they will call.\n\nWe also need tournament considerations: 80 BB stack, not huge but decent. We can afford a decent bet.\n\nThus I think raise to 80 (total bet 80). Reason: value and protection.\n\nCheck alternative: Could check and see turn. But opponent may give free card, dangerous for draws. So raise.\n\nThus answer: raise to 80.\n\n",

Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. The current bet is 0, so raise to at least 20 (i.e., 20 total). Could raise larger. Consider opponent's tendencies unknown. We have top pair, decent hand, can bet for value. Might raise to about half pot: pot 71, raise to 100? That's 100 total? Actually raise_to is total we put in, not additional. So if we raise to 100, we are adding 100 chips (since no bet). That's about 1.4x pot. Might be okay. Opponent's stack 214, could call. Might want to extract value but also protect against draws (A could be a higher pair? Actually opponent could have A? Board As, they could have A?? Actually As is on board, so opponent could have A with kicker. They could have A? But As is board, so they'd need another Ace for trips. Could have pocket Aces? That's unlikely. Could have set of 7? board 7c, could have 7x for set. So opponent could have set. But they checked. Checking with set is unlikely; they'd bet. So likely they have weak hand. So we can bet.

No ten on board. So currently we have overpair? No board has pair of eights, we have 10 high, not a pair. So we have just high card Ten, which is weak. Opponent bet 6, likely representing a hand. Our stack is 229, pot 10, bet 6 is 60% of pot. Call would be 6 into pot 16 (including bet). Odds: need to win > 6/22 = 27% to be profitable.

Actually SB posted 1, BB 2, seat4 called 2, so SB to act after seat4? The order: SB first posted 1, then BB posted 2, seat3 folded, seat4 called 2, now it's SB's turn, amount to call is 1 (to match BB's 2). So we can call 1, raise min to 4 total (i.e., raise 3 more). Hand Ah7s is a decent suited ace but low kicker. In SB, with 112.5 BB stack, we can consider raising to isolate. Opponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called BB, unknown tendencies. Seat1 is BB with 370 chips (big stack). He hasn't acted yet? Actually BB already posted 2, but hasn't acted preflop after seat4. In SB, after SB posts, BB posts, then UTG etc. But here seats: seat5 SB, seat1 BB, seat4 called, now SB acts. Actually order: SB first, then BB, then seat3 (UTG?) folded, seat4 (CO?) called, now it's SB again? Wait typical order: preflop action starts with UTG (seat after BB). But here we have only 3 players left: SB (seat5), BB (seat1), seat4 (seat4). The order after blinds: first player after BB is seat2 (folded), seat3 (folded), seat4 (call), seat5 (SB) already posted and is first to act? Actually SB posts before action, then first to act is UTG (seat2), then seat3, seat4, seat5 (SB) is last to act preflop. So SB acts last preflop. So we face a call of 1 to match BB's 2 (and seat4's 2). So we can raise.\n\nGiven Ah7s suited, it's a decent hand for a raise in SB to steal blinds and maybe isolate. But opponent seat4 just called, likely a wide range. BB seat1 hasn't acted yet; they have big stack and may 3-bet.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call, raise. With Ace-high suited, raising is typical to apply pressure and get value. Minimum raise to 4 total means raise 3 more (so total contribution becomes 4). That would be a raise of 2x the big blind (since BB is 2). That's a standard raise.\n\nConsider stack sizes: we have deep stack, can raise bigger but min is 4. Could also go all-in? No need.\n\nThus raise to 4 seems good.\n\nReasoning: Hand strength moderate, suited ace, position disadvantage but we can raise to steal, isolate. Also opponent seat4 called, likely wide, could fold to raise. BB may 3-bet, but we can fold if 3-bet.\n\nThus action: raise to 4.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with Ah7s. Board: 5s 6s 9d. So we have a flush draw (two spades on board, we have spade 7, plus Ace spade, so we have Ace-high flush draw, plus open-ended straight draw? Board 5-6-9, we have 7, so we have 5-6-7, need 8 for straight, also have Ace for gutshot? Actually 5-6-7, need 8 to make 5-6-7-8-9 straight, we have 9 on board, so we need 8 for straight. So we have both a flush draw and a gutshot? Actually we have 7s, board 5s6s9d. With 7s, we have 5-6-7, need 8 for straight. Also we have Ace spade for flush draw (need any spade). So we have strong draw.\n\nStack 222 chips. Pot 10 chips. Opponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) called preflop and is now in the hand. It's flop, amount to call 0 (since no bet). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 2. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies from recall: Past flop actions: He sometimes checks, sometimes calls, sometimes bets (hand 8). In 9 flops, he checked 4 times, called 4 times, bet once (6 chips). So mixed. He may be passive.\n\nWe are in BB, out of position vs him (he is MP? Actually seat 4 is left of us? Seat order: seat 5 is BB, seat 4 is before us (to our right). So he's in early position (UTG?). Actually seat numbers: 1 is SB, 2 is BB? Wait blinds: seat1 posted sb 1, seat5 posted bb 2? Actually preflop: seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So seat4 is MP maybe. Anyway we are SB? Actually seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB (small blind). So we are out of position after flop (SB is first to act). So we act first.\n\nWe have strong draw, want to build pot and maybe protect. Raising could make him fold weaker hands, or give us money if he calls. Since pot is small, raising to 2 (minimum) is good. Could also raise more to protect against draws. Our stack is deep relative to pot (222 vs 10). But tournament stage? Not given, but we have 111 BB, deep stack. So we can be aggressive.\n\nConsider opponent's range: He called preflop raise from SB (our raise to 4). He likely has a broad range: maybe suited connectors, pairs, etc. The board 5s6s9d hits many hands: 6x, 5x, spade draws, straight draws. He may have a made hand like 9x, 6x, 5x, maybe two pair, etc. Raising could isolate and get value if he has a made hand, but also could be called by draws.\n\nGiven we have strong draws, we could semi-bluff raise. Minimum raise to 2 is small, but we could raise to maybe 6? But legal raise minimum is 2 (total). We can raise to any amount up to our stack, but typical is 2-4. Since pot is 10, raising to 6 (i.e., bet 6) would be 0.6 pot, decent.\n\nBut we need to consider opponent's likely reaction: He has called preflop, so he may call our flop raise often. If we raise to 6, he'll call with many draws, but we still have equity.\n\nGiven tournament, preserving stack is okay. I'd raise to maybe 6 chips (total). Provide reasoning.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 6.\n\n",

Actually we need two more spades to make flush, so currently we have a flush draw with 2 outs? No, need 2 spades to complete flush, we have 2 spades in hand+board? We have 7s, board has 5s,6s. That's three spades. Need two more spades among remaining cards to make flush (5 spades needed). So we need two spades on turn and river? That's not a draw. So we have no flush draw.

Actually we have 5-6-7, need 8 or 4. 4 would give 4-5-6-7-? need 8? Not. So only 8 gives straight. So one-card straight draw (8). So we have a gutshot (one out). Also we have a pair of Aces? No, board has no Ace. So we have Ace high.\n\nPot size: 22 chips. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in seat 4. Stack: 193 chips. He called flop bet of 6. So now on turn, action: we are in BB, we acted last on flop (bet 6, opponent called). Now it's our turn on turn? Actually after flop betting round, we bet then opponent called, so turn action starts with us (BB) first? Usually action proceeds clockwise from the button. But since we are BB and we were first to act preflop, flop betting started with us (BB) bet, then opponent called. On turn, action starts with the player after the button? Actually button is seat1? Not sure. But given \"Amount to call: 0\" indicates it's our turn and we have no bet to call, we can check or bet/raise. Minimum raise to 6. So we can check or raise.\n\nOur hand is weak. Opponent's range: He called preflop raise (we raised to 4 from SB? Actually preflop: seat5 (us) raise 4, seat4 call 2 (actually call 2? Wait preflop: seat4 call 2 (call big blind), then seat5 raise 4 (SB?), need parse: Preflop: seat5 post_sb 1 (small blind 1). seat1 post_bb 2 (big blind 2). seat3 fold. seat4 call 2 (calls big blind). seat5 raise 4 (raise from small blind to 4). seat1 fold. seat4 call 2 (call raise). So we raised to 4 (total bet). Opponent called 2 more to match 4. So preflop we have a raise with A7 offsuit. Opponent likely has a wide range but perhaps medium.\n\nFlop: board 5s 6s 9d. We bet 6 into pot 22? Actually pot before flop bet: preflop pot: small blind 1 + big blind 2 + call 2 + raise 4 + call 2 = 11? Wait compute: SB 1, BB 2, seat4 call 2, seat5 raise 4 (so adds 3 more beyond SB?), Actually raise from 1 to 4 means extra 3, then seat4 call extra 2 to match 4 (so adds 2). So total chips: SB 1, BB 2, seat4 2+2=4, seat5 4 = 4? Not sure. Anyway pot 22 after flop betting: we bet 6, opponent called 6. So pot now 22 + 6+6 = 34? Actually they said Pot: 22 chips before flop? It says Pot: 22 chips (maybe after preflop). Then flop bet 6, call 6 makes pot 34. Now turn: pot 34? But they list amount to call 0, min raise 6.\n\nWe have weak hand, likely fold to raise.

Not sure. But given \"Amount to call: 0\" indicates it's our turn and we have no bet to call, we can check or bet/raise. Minimum raise to 6. So we can check or raise.\n\nOur hand is weak. Opponent's range: He called preflop raise (we raised to 4 from SB? Actually preflop: seat5 (us) raise 4, seat4 call 2 (actually call 2? Wait preflop: seat4 call 2 (call big blind), then seat5 raise 4 (SB?), need parse: Preflop: seat5 post_sb 1 (small blind 1). seat1 post_bb 2 (big blind 2). seat3 fold. seat4 call 2 (calls big blind). seat5 raise 4 (raise from small blind to 4). seat1 fold. seat4 call 2 (call raise). So we raised to 4 (total bet). Opponent called 2 more to match 4. So preflop we have a raise with A7 offsuit. Opponent likely has a wide range but perhaps medium.\n\nFlop: board 5s 6s 9d. We bet 6 into pot 22? Actually pot before flop bet: preflop pot: small blind 1 + big blind 2 + call 2 + raise 4 + call 2 = 11? Wait compute: SB 1, BB 2, seat4 call 2, seat5 raise 4 (so adds 3 more beyond SB?), Actually raise from 1 to 4 means extra 3, then seat4 call extra 2 to match 4 (so adds 2). So total chips: SB 1, BB 2, seat4 2+2=4, seat5 4 = 4? Not sure. Anyway pot 22 after flop betting: we bet 6, opponent called 6. So pot now 22 + 6+6 = 34? Actually they said Pot: 22 chips before flop? It says Pot: 22 chips (maybe after preflop). Then flop bet 6, call 6 makes pot 34. Now turn: pot 34? But they list amount to call 0, min raise 6.\n\nWe have weak hand, likely fold to raise. Checking is safe. Opponent",

Suits: we have Ah (hearts) and 7s (spades). Board has two spades (5s,6s). So we have a nut flush draw? Actually we have one spade, need two more spades for flush. There are two spades on board, we have one spade, so need two more spades on river to make flush, which is impossible (only one card left). So no flush draw. Straight draw? Board: 5-6-9-5. We have A7. Could we have a gutshot? 7 with 5-6 gives 5-6-7, need 8 for straight. Not present. 5-6-7-8-9 would be straight but need 8 and 9, we have 9 on board, need 8 on river to complete straight (5-6-7-8-9). That's an open-ended? Actually we have 5-6 on board, we have 7, need 8 to complete. That's a gutshot? No, we have 5-6-7, need 8-9 to complete? Wait a straight of 5-6-7-8-9 uses 5,6,7,8,9. We have 5,6,9 on board, 7 in hand, missing 8. So we need exactly 8 on river to make straight. That's a single-card draw (one-out). Also we have Ace high, maybe pair? No pair. So hand currently: A high, with gutshot draw to straight (8). Also possible backdoor flush? We have hearts Ace, board has no hearts, so no.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 is on the button? Actually seat 4. They called preflop raise, flop they called bet 6. Turn they bet 8. So they are showing aggression.\n\nPot size before turn bet: after flop, pot 30? Actually pot after flop: Preflop pot: 1+2+2+4+2? Let's compute: Preflop: seat5 posted sb 1, seat1 posted bb 2, seat4 call 2, seat5 raise 4 (so adds 4, total seat5 contributed 1+4=5?), seat1 fold, seat4 call 2 (so seat4 contributed 2+2=4). So preflop pot = 1+2+2+4+2 =11? Actually raise 4 means they put total 4? Usually raise to 4 means total bet 4 (including sb). So seat5 contributed 4 total, seat4 contributed 4 total (2 call + 2 call). So pot = 1+2+4+4 =11? Not sure but given pot on flop is 30 chips as per description. So after flop betting 6 each, pot becomes 30. Turn: seat5 check, seat4 bet 8. So pot before turn bet = 30. After seat4 bet 8, pot will be 38 if called, 30+8 =38. Amount to call 8. So pot odds: call 8 to win pot 38+8? Actually if call, you add 8, pot becomes 46 (30+8+8). So pot odds = 8/(46) = 17.4%. Need about 17% equity. Our chance: we have one-out (8). There are 46 unseen cards? Actually we have seen: our 2 cards, board 4 cards =6 known. Opponent unknown 2? Actually opponent has 2 unknown cards, but we consider outs ignoring opponent's cards. So remaining deck: 52-6 =46. Out of 46, one card (8) gives us straight. Also maybe other outs? If opponent has a pair, we could still have Ace high? Not enough. So only 1 out. Probability to hit on river = 1/46 \u2248 2.2%. That's far below pot odds 17%. So calling is not profitable. Could we raise? Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total bet 16). Raising would be even worse. So we should fold.\n\nBut consider tournament context: we have 216 chips, opponent 185 chips. Our stack is larger. Our hand is weak. Fold is correct.\n\nThus output JSON with action fold, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Wait compute: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, MiniMax call 2, BB raise 4 (so BB put 4 total? Actually BB posted 2 blind, then raise to 4 means additional 2? Usually raise to 4 total, so BB contributed 4. MiniMax call 2 additional (since already 2 in pot). So preflop pot: SB 1, BB 4, MiniMax 4? Actually MiniMax posted 2 blind? No, MiniMax is seat4, posted 2 (call) after BB raise.

Could we consider a bluff raise? We have 108 BB, deep stack, but opponent's behavior: they bet on turn often (multiple times). In recall, they bet 74 on turn in hand5 (big), bet 6 on turn in hand15 (small), bet 8 on turn hand16 (like this), bet 24 on turn hand19. So they are aggressive on turn, possibly semi-bluffing with draws. Board has a possible flush draw (two spades on board, we have one spade, they could have spade draw). Also paired board, could have full house. Our A7 is not strong. Likely fold. So action fold.\n\nReturn JSON.",

We need to decide fold/call/raise.\n\nWe have Tc Qd suited? No, Qd and Tc are different suits (clubs and diamonds). So offsuit.\n\nHand strength: QcTc is decent, but not premium. In BTN vs raise from MP (seat4). Stack sizes: opponent 207 chips, about 51.75 BB. Our stack 54 BB. Raise size 8 (2x BB). So it's a standard open raise from MP? Actually it's a raise from seat4 (likely MP). He raised 8 (2x BB). That's a small raise. We could call and see flop. QcTc offsuit is a decent hand in BTN, can be played profitably.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall shows MiniMax-M2 raised 4 previously (preflop) in two earlier hands. That suggests maybe they raise small amounts, perhaps wide range.\n\nOur position: BTN, best position post-flop. Stack deep enough.\n\nPot odds: To call 8 to win pot of 14+8 = 22? Actually pot currently 14 (SB+BB+raise). To call 8 adds to pot, making total 22 after call. So we are getting 22/8 = 2.75:1 pot odds, need ~36.4% equity. QcTc vs unknown range likely >36%? Might be borderline. But we have position.\n\nGiven we have a decent hand and position, could call and try to see flop. Raising could be possible to isolate and build pot. Minimum raise is 12 (total). That would be raise to 12, adding 4 more beyond call. That would be a small raise. Might be okay.\n\nBut we must consider risk: If opponent is aggressive and can 3-bet, raising might invite a 3-bet. But with 54 BB, we can handle.\n\nI think best action: call. Reason: decent hand, good position, pot odds okay, opponent likely raising wide.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #25. We're BTN with A\u2660 T\u2660? Actually Ad Ts (Ace diamonds, Ten spades). Position BTN, stack 202 chips (~50 BB). Blinds 2/4. SB posted 2, BB posted 4. MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) raised to 8 (so min raise to 12). So action to call 8 (i.e., total 8 to call? Actually amount to call is 8, meaning they raised to 8, so we need to put 8 total? Wait: In pot, SB 2, BB 4, raise to 8 means they added 4 more (since BB 4). So amount to call is 8 - we have to put 8 total, but we already have 0, so call 8. Minimum raise to 12 (so raise to 12 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: A T suited is a decent hand, especially from BTN vs raise from MP (seat 4 likely is MP? Actually seat numbers: Seat 1 SB, seat 3 BB, seat 4 is under the gun? The positions: Seat numbers 1-8. Seat 5 is BTN. So seat 4 is CO (cutoff) maybe. So MiniMax-M2 is in CO raising to 8 (2x BB). That's a standard raise. A T suited is a good hand to 3-bet or call depending on opponent tendencies. Need to recall opponent's raise patterns. We have recall data: MiniMax-M2 raises amounts: 4, 8, 48, 8, 8. So they sometimes raise larger (48) maybe when they have strong hand. But typical raise is 8 (2x BB). In hand 21 they raised to 48 (big raise). So they can be aggressive.\n\nWe need to decide whether to 3-bet. Stack 202, we can 3-bet to maybe 24 (6x BB) or larger. Considering tournament, 50 BB stack, we can apply pressure.\n\nWe might want to 3-bet to isolate and take pot. A T suited has good equity vs many hands. Also we are in position. The opponent's raise is small, so 3-bet is good.\n\nBut we also need to consider that there are still players left? SB and BB haven't acted yet after us; they could call or fold. If we raise, they might fold, we get heads-up. If we call, we risk being out of position after flop? Actually we are in position, but after raise from CO, SB and BB act after us (since we are BTN). So if we call, we will be out of position? The action order: after raise, SB acts, then BB, then us (BTN). So if we call, we will be after them? Actually order: SB (seat1) posted 2, BB (seat3) posted 4, raise from seat4, then SB, BB, BTN. So if we call, we are last to act preflop, but after us is flop with us in position (BTN). So still good.\n\nGiven raise is 8, calling puts 8 in pot, leaving us with 194 chips left. 3-bet to maybe 24 would be a decent size (6BB). That would be a raise of 16 more (total 24). Minimum raise is 12, but we can raise larger.\n\nWe should consider opponent's tendencies: MiniMax-M2 sometimes raises big (48). That could indicate they sometimes do 3-bets themselves? Actually 48 is huge (12x BB). That could be a 3-bet from them after a raise? But we only have preflop raises. Not sure.\n\nGiven we have strong hand, I think 3-bet. Let's raise to maybe 24. Reason: isolate, build pot, leverage position.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 24.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "content": "We need to decide action on turn. Board: 2s 2h Qd 3d. Our hand: Ad Ts (Ace of diamonds, Ten of spades). So we have Ace-high, plus a backdoor flush draw (diamond) with Ace of diamonds gives us nut flush draw? Actually board has two diamonds (Qd, 3d). We have Ad, so we have Ace of diamonds, giving us a nut flush draw (any diamond would give us flush, Ace is highest). Also we have a gutshot? Straight draw? Board: 2,2,Q,3. Ten gives us open-ended? No. Ten with Q could make straight? Ten-J-Q-K? Not. So only flush draw.\n\nAlso we have pair of 2s on board, opponent may have 2x for set. Our hand currently is Ace-high, not a made hand. Turn check from opponent (MiniMax-M2). Pot is 54. We are on button, stack 178. Minimum raise 16. Options: check or raise.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, MiniMax-M2 on flop often checks, sometimes bets small, occasionally big bets. On turn, they have checked this time. Likely a weak hand or drawing. Could be a set of 2s, or a queen, or a flush draw, or a straight draw? Board: 2-2-Q-3. They could have Qx, 2x, maybe a straight draw like A-K? Not. So they might have a made hand (set) or a draw (flush draw). Our raise could apply pressure, maybe steal the pot if they are weak. However we have a flush draw; raising could also build pot for when we hit flush.\n\nBut we have only 44.5 BB, still decent stack. Opponent has 277 chips (about 69 BB). So we could raise to maybe 30-40 chips to apply pressure. But need to consider risk: if they have set, they will call or raise. If we raise and they call, pot becomes larger and we risk more chips if we miss flush.\n\nCheck: we could check, see if they bet later (turn already checked). Actually we are on turn after opponent checked, it's our action. If we check, we go to river for free. River card unknown. Could be a diamond completing flush. If we check, we keep pot small and can decide on river.\n\nGiven we have only Ace-high, raising may be a bluff. Opponent may call with any pair, queen, etc. Might be risky.\n\nWhat is pot odds? If we raise to 16 (minimum) we risk 16 to win 54 + 16 = 70 pot, giving us 70/16 ~ 4.4:1. That's about 18% equity needed. Our hand equity? Ace-high vs unknown range: likely less than 20%? Might be borderline. But we also have flush draw: about 9 outs (diamonds: we have Ace, board has Qd, 3d, so remaining diamonds: 13-2=11? Actually diamonds: A, Q, 3 are on board or in hand. Remaining diamonds: K, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2? Wait 2 of diamonds not on board (board has 2s and 2h, not diamond). So there are 13 diamonds total, we have Ad, board has Qd, 3d. So remaining: Kd, Jd, Td, 9d, 8d, 7d, 6d, 5d, 4d, 2d. That's 10 outs. Actually also maybe 2d is a diamond but board has 2s 2h, so 2d is an extra 2, but would give us a full house? Actually if a 2 appears, we would have trips of 2s? But we have Ace-high, not relevant. So 10 outs. On river, chance ~10/46 = 21.7%. So equity with flush draw about 22% plus current hand value maybe 5%? So overall maybe 27% equity. That's above 18% needed to call a raise of 16. So raise to 16 is profitable EV if opponent calls with any hand less than our equity? Actually we are raising as bluff, but we also have some equity. If opponent folds, we win 54 pot. If they call, we have 27% chance to win ~ (pot after call) 70. So expected value = fold prob * 54 + call prob * (0.27*70 - 0.73*16). We need estimate opponent call frequency. If they call only with strong hands maybe 30%? Hard.\n\nGiven opponent's pattern:"

          "reasoning_content": "We need decide action on river. Situation: we have Ad Ts. Board: 2s 2h Qd 3d 6c. So board pairs 2s2h, queen, 3, 6. No flush possible (two diamonds on board, we have none). Straight possibilities? Board: 2,2,3,6,Q. We have A T. No straight. Our hand: Ace high with Ten kicker. Opponent MiniMax-M2 checked river. Pot 102 chips. Our stack 154, we have 38.5 BB. Opponent's stack 253. He checked, we can check or bet (raise). Need to consider opponent's range. Preflop: He raised 8 from UTG? Actually seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised 8 (2 BB) from early position? He called our 24 raise preflop, so we 3-bet to 24. He called. So preflop he is willing to call a 3-bet with a range that includes strong hands, maybe broadway, suited connectors, pairs, etc. Flop: board 2s 2h Qd. He checked, we checked. Turn: board 3d, he checked, we bet 24, he called. So his call to our turn bet indicates some hand with maybe a pair, a draw, or a weak queen? He might have a queen, a 2, a 3, a 6, a straight draw? He called 24 into pot 78 (pre-turn pot?). Let's compute pot sizes: Preflop: we raised to 24, he called 16 (since he had posted 4 blind). So pot after preflop: 2+4+8+24+16 = 54? Actually blinds 2+4 =6. Our raise to 24 adds 20 more (we already posted 4). He called 16 extra (since he posted 4). So total: 6 + (24-4) + (16) = 6+20+16=42. Wait compute: contributions: Seat1 post_sb 2 (SB), Seat3 post_bb 4 (BB). Seat4 raise 8 (so adds 8-4=4 extra). Seat5 raise 24 (adds 24-4=20 extra). Seat4 call 16 (adds 16-4=12). So total contributions: SB 2, BB 4, seat4 8+12 =20, seat5 24. Sum = 2+4+20+24 =50. So pot after preflop = 50.\n\nFlop: board 2s 2h Qd. Seat4 check, seat5 check. No bets, pot remains 50.\n\nTurn: board 3d. Seat4 check, seat5 bet 24, seat4 call 24. So pot after turn: 50 + 24 (our bet) + 24 (call) = 98.\n\nRiver: seat4 check, amount to call 0, pot 102 (they added 4 more maybe from blinds? Actually after turn pot 98, then seat4 check, seat5 could bet but they check, so pot remains 98? But given pot 102, maybe there is 4 from something else? Might be rounding. Anyway pot ~102.\n\nWe have Ace high. Opponent likely has something better than Ace high: could have queen, pair of 2s, 3, 6, maybe a straight draw missed. He called turn bet, so likely has a hand with showdown value: maybe a queen (Qx), a 2 (pair), a 3 (pair of 3?), a 6 (pair), a straight draw (like 4-5) but missed. Could also have a bluff, but less likely.\n\nOur hand is weak, likely losing. Should we check? Probably check to avoid losing more chips. If we bet, we risk being called and losing 24 (or more) with Ace high. Could we attempt a bluff? River board has paired 2s, queen high, and we have Ace high. Opponent may have queen, which beats us. So bluff unlikely to succeed. Also our stack is 154, pot 102, we could bet 24 (minimum raise) making pot ~126, we risk 24 more. If opponent folds, we win 102. But opponent likely has queen or pair and would call. So better to check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nLegal actions include raise, but we choose check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

No need 7 or T? Let's think: Straight combos: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 7), 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 7 and T? Actually you need 7 and T? Wait you have 8,9,6. For 6-7-8-9-10 you need both 7 and T. That's not possible with one card. So only open-ended draw is 7 to make 6-7-8-9-? Actually need also 5? Straight 5-6-7-8-9 needs 7 and 5? You have 6,8,9, need 7 and 5. Not possible. So actually you have only a gutshot? Let's enumerate possible straights containing 6,8,9: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 5 and 7), 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 7 and 10). So you need two cards. So you have no straight draw. You have two overcards (K,Q) vs board. Board is relatively low, no flush draws (two diamonds, one heart, one club). So hand is just K high, Q high. Not strong.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 bet 8 into pot 34, so pot now 42 after bet? Actually pot was 34, bet 8 adds to pot 42, we need call 8 to see turn.\n\nWe need to decide: call, raise, or fold. Our hand likely weak. Opponent's bet size is 8 (half pot). Could be continuation bet, could be trying to steal. Our stack 238, opponent stack 207. Opponent's tendencies: from recall we have three prior flop bets: amounts 6, 40, 12. Mixed sizes. No info on aggression.\n\nGiven we have KQ, could be decent showdown value if opponent has lower pair or draws. But board 8-9-6, opponent could have 8,9,6, or straight draw. Our KQ is decent overcards. But we are out of position (BB vs opponent in seat 4, which is UTG? Actually seat 4 is maybe MP). We are out of position post-flop.\n\nGiven tournament, stack 59.5 BB, not short. Probably fold to avoid losing 8 chips with weak hand. However maybe call to see turn if opponent is bluffing. The bet is small relative to pot, could be a probe.\n\nWhat is pot odds? Pot 34 + 8 bet = 42, call 8 to win 42, odds = 8/42 = 0.19, need 19% equity. Our hand vs unknown could be >19%? With KQ vs random? Might be around 30%? But opponent may have made a bet with range including many hands, our equity maybe lower. But we have two overcards, could be decent.\n\nGiven we have no draw, just showdown value, maybe call.\n\nBut consider opponent's previous flop bets: one was 6 (small), one 12 (small), one 40 (large). So they vary. Not enough.\n\nI think call.\n\nThus JSON: action call, raise_to null.\n\n",

Currently pot 42, turn check from opponent (MiniMax-M2). We are in BB, stack 230, opponent stack 207. Opponent checked, we can check or raise. What is opponent's likely range? Preflop they called raise 12 (so they have 8-9? Actually they called 12 after raise to 12? Preflop: we raised to 12, they called 8 (since they posted 4 bb, call 8). So they have a calling range: could be broadway, suited connectors, etc. On flop, board 8d 9h 6c, they bet 8 (small). We called. So they may have middle pair, draws, etc. Turn is 7h, giving board 8-9-6-7, making a straight draw for us (open-ended). Also board now has 8-9-7-6, no pair yet. Opponent checked. Likely they missed the straight, maybe have 8x, 9x, 67, etc. Could be a pair of 8s or 9s? They might have 8? If they had 8, they'd have top pair with a gutshot? Actually board has 8,9,6,7. If they have 8, they'd have pair. Might check to see if we bet. We have strong draw, equity high. Should we bet to represent a made hand and maybe get value if they have 8/9? Also we could check to induce bluffs later. Considering tournament, stack moderate, we can raise to build pot if we hit. Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8? Actually raise amount total must be at least 8 more than call? Minimum raise to 8 means total bet of 8? Since amount to call is 0, raising to 8 is a bet of 8. That is small. Could raise bigger, but only legal actions: raise (any amount up to stack). We can raise to maybe 30 or 40 to price in. Opponent stack 207, pot 42, we could bet ~20-30 to apply pressure.\n\nGiven open-ended straight draw, pot odds: need 5 or T. Two outs? Actually 4 outs each? Straight: need 5 or T, 4 cards each (four 5s, four Ts) = 8 outs. Plus maybe backdoor flush diamond: two more outs (if 5d or Td). So about 10 outs. On turn, we have 1 card left (river). Probability to hit: 10/46 \u2248 21.7%. So equity ~22% plus current hand maybe some showdown value if opponent has pair? Our hand currently is just high cards, no pair. If opponent has 8 or 9, they'd be ahead. So we need to consider pot odds: pot 42, if we bet 20, we risk 20 to win 62 (pot+bet). That's 20/62 = 32% needed. Our equity 22% < 32, not good. If we bet smaller 8, risk 8 to win 50, need 16% equity, which we have 22% > 16, so good. So small bet is +EV.\n\nThus we should raise (bet) to minimum 8 to apply pressure. Reason: we have decent equity and can fold if they raise. Also could check, but betting may win pot now.\n\nThus action: raise to 8. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

My hand has virtually no showdown value, and the pot odds (\u224835%) do not justify a call. Folding preserves my stack.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action facing river bet 66 into pot 124, we have Kd Qc. Board: 8d 9h 6c 7h 2h. So board is 8-9-6-7-2 with two hearts (9h,7h). Our hand Kd Qc gives us straight? Let's see: board has 6,7,8,9. That's a 6-7-8-9 straight draw. We have K and Q, which gives us a gutshot? Actually Q completes a straight 6-7-8-9-10? No, Q is not 10. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 5), 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 10). We have K and Q, so no straight. Could we have a flush? Two hearts on board, we have no hearts. So no flush. So we have just high cards K and Q, which is not a made hand; best we have is King high. The board is fairly coordinated, could be many draws. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 66 on river. Pot before river bet: after turn, pot? Let's compute: Preflop: we raised to 12, opponent called 8 (so put 8). So pot after preflop: 12+8+ blinds? Blinds are 2 (SB) and 4 (BB). SB posted 2 (seat3) but folded, BB posted 4 (seat4) but then we raised? Actually seat4 posted BB 4, then we raised to 12 (so extra 8). So preflop contributions: SB 2 (folded), BB 4 (call?), but then we raise 12, so seat4 (BB) call 8? Actually seat4 is BB, they posted 4, then they called the raise? The action shows seat4 call 8 (so they put additional 8). So preflop contributions: seat5 (us) 12, seat4 8+4=12? Actually seat4 posted 4 blind then called 8, total 12. So pot = 2+12+12 = 26? Wait SB 2, BB 4, then raise to 12 (so we put 12), BB calls 8 (total 12). So total chips: SB 2, BB 12, us 12 = 26. Yes pot 26 preflop.\n\nFlop: seat4 bet 8, seat5 call 8. So add 16 to pot => pot 42.\n\nTurn: seat4 check, seat5 bet 8, seat4 call 8. Add 16 => pot 58.\n\nRiver: seat4 bet 66, we face 66 to call. So pot before river bet = 58. After bet, pot would be 58+66 =124 (matches given pot). So we need to call 66 to win 124. Pot odds = 66/ (66+124?) Actually call amount 66 to win 124+66? Wait after call, total pot = 124+66 =190. So odds = 66/190 = 34.7% needed. Our hand is King high, basically a bluff-catcher? Opponent may be betting as bluff or value. Board is 8-9-6-7-2. Could opponent have a straight? They could have 5 or 10. Could have a pair, two pair, trips, etc. Our KQ is not a made hand; we likely lose most of time. So folding is correct.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: recall shows they raised river 24 once, checked twice, folded once. Not much data. Probably they bet for value with decent hand. So we fold.\n\nWe have stack 222, calling would leave 156. Not huge.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

Opponent's flop tendencies: from recall, they have checked in hand #25, but also bet in others. Mixed. But given board, they might bet if they have a set or queen. Since they checked this time, they likely have nothing strong or are pot controlling. We could consider checking back to see turn cheaply. Raising could be a bluff but we have no equity, and raise size min 4 (to total 4?). Actually raise to 4 means raise to total 4? Minimum raise to 4, pot 8, raise to 4 would be less than pot? Actually raise to total 4 chips from 0? That seems odd; but rule: raise_to is total amount we put in. So raise to 4 means we bet 4 chips. That is a small bet, maybe a bluff. But we have weak hand and opponent may have queen or set, they'd likely call or raise. Might lose more. Better to check and preserve stack. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise.

Stack is deep 54 BB, can 3-bet to maybe 2.5-3x raise size. Minimum raise is 12 (i.e., to 12 total). That is a small 3-bet but we could raise more. We can also call. But 3-betting is typical to isolate and build pot. Opponent's raise pattern: they sometimes raise 4 (small), 8, 48, 28. They have raised 8 multiple times, also 48 (big). So they may be variable. With AK, a 3-bet is advisable.\n\nWe need to decide raise amount. Legal actions: we can raise to any amount >=12. Typically we could raise to about 3x the original raise: original raise was 8 total, so 3x is 24. Considering stack 54 BB, we could raise to 20-25. Let's choose 24 total (i.e., raise to 24). That would be additional 22 chips (since we have already 2 posted, need to add 22 to make total 24). That's a decent 3-bet.\n\nReasoning: strong hand, position, deep stack, want to isolate, opponent's raise size moderate, we can apply pressure.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

MiniMax-M2 checked, likely with a weaker hand or a draw. Betting extracts value from hands like QJ, AQ, or draws and protects against potential spade draws. A moderate raise to 30 (~0.75 pot) balances value and risk.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have flop: Ks 4s Qc. Our hand: Kc Ad => top pair top kicker (pair of Kings with Ace kicker). Also a nut flush draw? Actually we have Kc and Ad, board has Ks, 4s, Qc. We have one spade (Kc is club, Ad is diamond). Board has two spades (Ks and 4s). So we have a flush draw with two spades on board, we have zero spades, so we need two spades for flush, not a draw. Straight draw? Board: K Q 4, we have A, K. Potential straight? A K Q J 10? Not possible. So we have top pair, decent hand. Opponent MiniMax-M2 is in the pot. He raised preflop to 8 (small raise) then we 3-bet to 24, he called. So he's a caller of 3-bet. On flop, it's his turn to act first? Actually order: preflop: seat 4 raise, seat5 raise, seat4 call. So seat5 is BB, seat4 is UTG? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2. After flop, action order: seat4 acts first (since he is earlier seat). The flop is checked to us (amount to call 0). So MiniMax-M2 checked. We have top pair. We could bet for value and protect against draws. What is pot size? 52 chips. Our stack 194. Minimum raise to 16 (so raise must be at least 16 total). So a bet of 16 (to 16) is a raise (since amount to call is 0). That would be 16 total, which is about 1/3 pot. Could also check. Opponent's tendencies: from recall, he sometimes checks flop with weak hands, sometimes bets. In hand 30, he bet flop 8 into pot (size unknown). In hand 31, he checked flop, then bet turn 4. So he's capable of both. Given we have top pair, we likely want value. Also we want to protect against possible straight draws? Not many. There's potential backdoor flush draw for him? He could have spades. If he has spade flush draw (e.g., As 9s) board has two spades, he'd have two spades in hand to make flush. He could have open-ended straight draw? With K Q 4, possible draws: J10 (needs J and 10), not many combos. So not many draws.\n\nThus betting for value is good. How much? Minimum raise 16. Could raise bigger maybe 30-40 to get value from KQ, AQ, etc. But we have only 48.5 BB, still medium stack. Opponent has 237 chips, larger stack. Might want to size to get value but not risk too much. A bet of 30 would be about 0.75 pot, still okay. Minimum raise is 16, but we can raise higher. The legal actions are fold, check, raise. So we can raise to any amount >=16 up to our stack. Should we consider check? Checking gives free card but could allow opponent to see a turn cheap. Might give him chance to improve. Betting also protects.\n\nThus I will raise to 30 chips (total). Reasoning: top pair, value, protect, opponent likely calls with worse hands. So action: raise 30.\n\n",

Actually we have Kc, board has Ks, so we have a pair of Kings, with Ace kicker. Also we have a nut flush draw? Board has two spades (Ks, 4s). Our hand has Kc Ad, no spade. So no flush draw. Straight possibilities: board Qc 6d plus we have Kc Ad, we have Ace high, possible straight draw? Need J and T for straight, not present. So we have top pair, decent. Opponent is MiniMax-M2, seat 4. Preflop: they raised to 8, we 3-bet to 24, they called. Flop: board K 4 Q. We bet 30 into pot 112? Actually pot before flop bet: preflop pot: blinds 2+4 + raise 8 + call 24? Let's compute: preflop: SB 2, BB 4, raise to 8 (so additional 6 from BB?), Actually seat4 raise to 8 (so they put 8 total). Seat5 (us) raise to 24 (so we put 24 total). Seat4 call 16 (they put additional 16 to match 24). So preflop pot: SB 2 + BB 4 + seat4 8+16 = 24? Wait seat4 initially 8 then added 16 = 24 total. Seat5 24 total. So total = 2+4+24+24 = 54. Then flop bet 30 by us, call 30 by seat4. So pot after flop: 54 + 30+30 = 114. But they say pot 112, close enough.\n\nNow turn: board adds 6d. Pot 112. It's our turn? Actually seat5 is BB, seat4 is opponent. After flop bet/call, it's seat5's turn to act on turn? Typically action proceeds from left of dealer, which is seat5? Actually positions: seat5 is BB, seat4 is MP? Not sure. But given actions, we have amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. So it's our turn (seat5) to act on turn, with no bet outstanding. So we can check or bet/raise.\n\nWe have top pair K with Ace kicker. Opponent's range: preflop raise 8, call 3-bet. Likely strong hands: AK, AQ, AJ, KQ, maybe TT, etc. Flop K Q, they called our bet. They could have KQ (made two pair), AK (top pair K with Ace kicker), AQ (pair Q), QJ (pair Q), maybe a set of 4s? No 4 on board, set of 6? No. They could have a straight draw like JT, but not many combos.\n\nWe bet 30 on flop, they called. That suggests they have something but not strong enough to raise. Could be Kx, Qx, or a draw.\n\nNow turn 6d. Does this change anything? No spade, no straight. If they have AK, they have Ace kicker too, but we have Ace too, but we have Kc, they could have As? Actually we have Ad, so opponent cannot have Ace of diamonds. They could have Ace of hearts/clubs/spades. If they have AK, they'd have Ace + King, they'd have two pair K and A? Actually board K Q 4, they'd have K and A, they'd have top pair K with Ace kicker, same as us but we have Ace of diamonds, they have Ace of something else, they'd also have pair of Kings (board) and Ace kicker. So they'd tie if they have AK. If they have KQ, they'd have two pair K and Q, we have just K pair, so they'd be ahead.\n\nIf they have AQ, they'd have pair of Q, we have pair of K, we are ahead. If they have JJ, they'd have gutshot? Not.\n\nThus we have decent hand, maybe ahead of many.\n\nConsider stack sizes: we have 164 chips, opponent 207. Pot 112. If we bet, we can size to maybe 60-80 to protect. Opponent could raise all-in if they have two pair or set. But there is no set possibility (board no pair). Two pair possible: KQ, K4, Q4. KQ is strong, they might have it. If they have KQ, they'd be ahead of us; we would lose if we call a raise. So we might want to check to see if they bet. If they bet large, we"

          "reasoning_content": "We have river decision. Our hand: Kc Ad. Board: Ks 4s Qc 6d 3h. So we have top pair (K) with Ace kicker, plus we have a pair of Kings (pair K) and Ace high. The board has possible straight draws: Q-J-10-9-8? Not present. Board: K Q 6 4 3. Straight possibilities: A K Q J 10 (we have A K Q but missing J10). Also possible straight with 5-4-3-2-A? We have 4-3 on board, but no 5 or 2. So no immediate straight. Flush possibility: Two spades on board (Kc is club, board has Ks (king of spades) and 4s (spade). Actually board: Ks (spade), 4s (spade). That's two spades. Our hand: Kc (club) and Ad (diamond). So we have no spade. So no flush.\n\nPotential for opponent having two pair or trips: Board has K Q 6 4 3. Opponent could have Qx for two pair Q-K? Actually board already has K and Q, so if opponent has Qx they'd have two pair Q-K. Could also have 6x for two pair 6-K etc. Or could have a set: If they have Kx they'd have set of Kings (but we have Kc, board has Ks, so they could have another King? Only one King left: Kd? Actually there are four kings: Kc (our), Ks (board), Kh, Kd. So opponent could have Kh or Kd, giving them a set (three of a kind) with board king. That's strong. Could also have a set of Qs if they have Qx, but board has Qc only one queen, so they'd need Qd, Qh, Qs for set. So possible.\n\nAlso could have a straight draw that missed, but likely they have something like a made hand.\n\nWe are on the river, pot is 112, opponent (MiniMax-M2) last action? The actions listed: turn: both checked. So on river, it's our turn (BB). Amount to call 0, min raise 30. So we can check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot check if we want to bet? Actually we can check (do nothing). Raising would be a bet.\n\nWe need to decide whether to bet for value or check. Our hand is top pair with Ace kicker, but there are possible better hands: set of Kings (Kx), set of Queens, two pair QK, maybe straight? Not likely. So we have decent but not best.\n\nWe need to consider opponent's tendencies. Recall opponent actions: In recent hand 30, on river they bet 66 into pot? Let's see: hand 30: river bet 66. That suggests they sometimes bet on river. In hand 30 they had board? Unknown. In hand 31 they bet 4 on turn. So they are somewhat aggressive.\n\nBut we need to decide best action: likely check to avoid getting raised and losing more chips, unless we think opponent will call a bet with worse hand (like a queen high). But they could also have a set and raise.\n\nGiven we have 164 chips (41 BB). Pot 112, so bet of 30 would be about 27% of pot, maybe value bet. If we bet 30, opponent may call with weaker hands like Qx, 6x, etc. But also may raise if they have set.\n\nWhat about stack sizes? Opponent stack unknown, but they have 207 chips (they are seat 4). So they have more chips.\n\nWe need to decide best EV. Usually with top pair top kicker on river, it's a marginal hand. Often checking is safe to avoid being raised. However, if opponent is capable of checking down with worse hands, we could extract value by betting. But risk of being raised and losing more.\n\nWe can try to recall opponent's river behavior: In hand 30, they bet 66 on river. What was the board? Unknown. But they were aggressive. In hand 31 they bet 4 on turn, not river.\n\nGiven limited info, I'd lean to check to avoid risk.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Raising could isolate. We could also consider 3-bet? But we are first to act (UTG), blinds posted, no raise yet. So we can either raise to 8 (standard) or call (just limp). LIMP is weak; better raise. So action: raise to 8. Reason: strong hand, early position, need to build pot, isolate, and opponent may 3-bet; we have good equity.\n\nThus JSON.",

Opponent (Seat1) called 8. So pot after preflop: 8+8+4 (big blind)?? Actually BB posted 4, then raised to 8, opponent called 8, so pot = 4 (our original BB) + 8 (our raise) + 8 (call) = 20? But pot listed as 22 after flop. Flop check both, so pot remains 22 (maybe includes antes). Anyway.\n\nNow turn: board adds 2d, making board: 2c 2d 3c 7h. So we have no pair, we have overcards K Q. Opponent may have a hand like a set (2s?), but board has two 2s, so only set is 2x? Actually there are three 2s on board (2c,2d, plus any 2 in hand). So opponent could have a 2 for trips. Also could have a set of 3? No only one 3. Could have a straight draw? Not likely. Could have a flush draw? No clubs on turn, only two clubs on board, need two more clubs.\n\nOur hand is weak. We have 67 BB, opponent has 292 chips. We are short stacked relative? Not extremely short; we have 67 BB, opponent 73 BB approx. Actually 292/4 =73 BB. So similar.\n\nWe should likely fold. Check legal actions: fold, check, raise. We can check (no bet). But we could also consider raising as bluff? But board is not favorable; we have no equity. Opponent may have a hand like 22 (set), or a hand like AK etc. Our raise would be 4 min raise to 4? Actually minimum raise is 4 (to total 4?). But we have already contributed 8 preflop and 0 on flop, pot 22. If we raise to 4, that would be weird because raise must be at least amount to call + min raise. Since amount to call is 0, min raise is 4, so raise to 4 total? That would be less than current pot, but allowed. But that would be a very small raise, maybe a probe. However we have no hand, and opponent may call with anything better. So best is to check and hope opponent checks behind? But we could also fold if we think opponent will bet. But we have no bet to call now. The action is on turn, amount to call 0, we can check. If we check, opponent may bet later on river. If we think opponent's range is strong, we might want to fold now? But we can't fold when there's no bet; folding means surrendering our hand and conceding the pot, which is fine. So we can just check and see later. But we need to decide best action: likely check (or fold? but folding now gives up pot). In poker, you cannot fold when there's no bet? Actually you can \"fold\" meaning you discard your hand and forfeit the pot. That is allowed. So we could fold now and give up the 22 pot. But checking is better because we still have chance to see river and maybe win if opponent checks and we get to showdown with K high? But we likely lose.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, but we have some chance if opponent checks and we go to showdown, we lose anyway because opponent likely has something. But maybe opponent could be bluff-catching? Unlikely.\n\nThus I'd choose check, to see opponent's action. Reason: weak hand, no equity, but we can check to avoid building pot.\n\nThus output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #35 preflop. Position: BB (seat5). Cards: 9s 7s (suited connectors). Stack 264 chips, 66 BB. Blinds 2/4. Pot currently 28 chips (includes blinds: SB 2, BB 4, plus raise from seat3 12, call from seat4 10? Actually seat3 raise 12 (so total bet 12), seat4 call 10 (since they already posted SB 2, they need 10 more to call 12). So pot = SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 12 + call 10 = 28. Yes.\n\nWe need to act: amount to call 8 (to match 12). Minimum raise to 20 (i.e., raise total to 20). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Hand 9s7s is a speculative hand. In BB vs raise from DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat3). Need to consider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2's raise sizes: past raises varied from 8 to 100, often 12, 16, etc. Could be wide? Let's check more: we have raise amounts: 10,8,12,16,100. That's a range. Could be aggressive, maybe open-raising wide. Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) just called the raise (post SB). So they are likely a caller.\n\nOur stack is deep (66 BB). 9s7s suited can be played in multi-way pots, but we are out of position in BB against a raise and a caller. The implied odds are limited, but we could consider a call to see flop cheap (8). Pot odds: pot 28, call 8 => pot will be 36 after call, we invest 8 to win 36 => 8/36 = 22% needed. Hand equity vs typical range? If DeepSeek raises wide maybe 2-3bb? Actually raise 12 is 3x BB. In 2-4 game, raise to 12 is 3BB. That's standard. Range could be about 15-20% of hands. Adding MiniMax call adds more players, making equity lower. 9s7s equity vs typical 15% range maybe around 15%? Might be borderline. But we have deep stack, could call for set mining? 9s7s can make straight draws and flush draws. Could be okay to call.\n\nAlternatively could raise to isolate, but raising 20 total (i.e., 20) would be 5BB total. That would be a 5BB raise. Might isolate MiniMax but also risk being 3-bet. Our hand is not strong enough to 3-bet for value, but could be a semi-bluff. But given we are deep and have position disadvantage, likely better to call and see flop.\n\nThus choose call.\n\nReasoning: decent suited connectors, good implied odds, pot odds favorable, opponent likely raising wide, caller present, deep stacks, call cheap.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

Actually we have 9-7 suited spades, board has Qd6c6s, we have no pair, no flush draw (two spades on board? board has 6s, we have 9s7s, so we have two spades in hand, board has one spade (6s). So we have a flush draw? Need 5 spades total, we have 2 spades, board has 1 spade, need 2 more spades on turn/river, that's a backdoor flush draw (2 outs? Actually need two spades among remaining cards). Also we have open-ended straight draw? 9-7 with board 6, need 8 to make 7-8-9, but need also 5 or 10? Actually straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9 (need 5 and 8) or 6-7-8-9-10 (need 8 and 10). So not immediate.\n\nWe have 9-7, not strong. Opponent (Seat 3, DeepSeek-V3.2) raised preflop to 12 from UTG? Actually seat 3 is maybe UTG? Not given. He raised 12, we called, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called as well. So three players in flop: Seat3 (DeepSeek) bet 20 into pot 76. So pot after bet: 76 + 20 = 96? Actually before bet pot 76 includes blinds and preflop calls. Then DeepSeek bets 20, seat4 calls 20, now we need to act. So pot currently 76+20+20 = 116? Wait seat4 hasn't acted yet? Actually flop actions: seat4 check, seat5 check, seat3 bet 20, seat4 call 20. So after seat4 call, pot = 76 + 20 (bet) + 20 (call) = 116. Now we face 20 bet.\n\nOur hand is weak. Opponent likely continuation bet with Qx, maybe a 6 pair, maybe a set? Actually board has pair of 6s; possible that DeepSeek has a 6, making trips, or a queen, top pair. Could also be a bluff.\n\nWe have 64 BB stack, 256 chips, so deep. Should we fold? Likely fold. Let's consider any reason to call: we have backdoor flush draw and straight draws, but odds: we need 2 spades out of remaining 45 cards (assuming unknown). That's about 2/45 ~4.4% per turn, then need another on river if missed turn. Combined probability maybe ~8-10% to make flush. Straight draws need two specific cards (5 and 8, or 8 and 10). That's 4 outs (5,8,10 maybe duplicates). Actually outs: 5,8,10. For 5-6-7-8-9 need 5 and 8 (2 cards). For 6-7-8-9-10 need 8 and 10 (2 cards). Overlap 8 appears in both combos, so outs: 5,8,10 = 3 distinct ranks, each 4 suits = 12 outs, but some may be blocked by known cards: board has Qd,6c,6s; our hand 9s,7s. So spades: we have 9s,7s, board 6s. So remaining spades: A,K,J,10,8,5,4,3,2 of spades = 9 spades. For straight outs: 5s,5c,5h,5d (4); 8s,8c,8h,8d (4); 10s,10c,10h,10d (4) but some may be already accounted: we have 9s,7s, board 6s. So 5s,8s,10s are spades; those are also flush outs. So total outs maybe 12 distinct cards (some overlap). So about 12 outs. Probability to hit on turn or river ~ 12/45 + (33/45)*(12/44) \u2248 0.267 + 0.75*0.273 = 0.267+0.205=0.472. Actually that's 47% to improve to a decent hand (pair or better). But we need to consider that if we hit a pair (like 9 or 7) that would be low pair, not strong. Actually we need to hit 9 or 7 to make a pair, that also counts as"

Actually seat4 is after SB? Let's map: Seats: 1 is BB, 2 is empty, 3 folded, 4 is maybe UTG? Actually order: Seat5 SB, then seat1 BB, then seat2 (empty), seat3 folded, seat4 is after seat3, so seat4 is UTG? Anyway seat4 called 4 (so they are in the pot). So we have SB posted 2, facing a call from seat4 of 4, and BB posted 4. So pot now 2+4+4+4 (SB posted 2, BB 4, seat4 call 4) = 14? Wait initial pot 10 chips (blinds). Then SB posted 2 (makes pot 12), BB posted 4 (makes pot 14), seat4 call 4 (makes pot 18). Actually the actions list: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 2, Seat1 post_bb 4, Seat3 fold, Seat4 call 4. So seat4 called the big blind (4) meaning they put 4 chips. So total chips in pot: 2+4+4 =10? Wait the blinds themselves are 2 and 4, which are part of pot 10 initially. Then seat5 posted sb 2 (that's already included?), Actually blinds are posted before hand, pot is 6 (2+4). But they say pot: 10 chips. Might include some antes? Not needed. Anyway amount to call: 2 (we need to call the BB's 4? Actually we are SB, we posted 2, the BB posted 4, seat4 called 4, so we need to call 2 more to match the 4? Yes amount to call is 2. Minimum raise to 8.\n\nGiven hand 8h3s is very weak, likely fold. Consider tournament stage? Stack 63.5 BB, still decent. Opponent tendencies unknown. But we can check opponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) stack 27 chips, short stack. Might be trying to steal? But we are SB, out of position, hand is terrible.

Consider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2's preflop raises amounts vary: 5,10,12,10,8,12,16,100,12. That suggests they raise sometimes bigger, maybe they are aggressive. But they are BB; they haven't raised yet, they just posted blind. So we are facing a call of 4. Our hand is weak, not a good candidate to steal.

However SB is very short; he may fold to raise. Raising to 8 (minimum) would be a 4 total raise (to 8 total). Actually minimum raise to is 8 (so total bet 8). That would be 4 more chips from us (since we already have 4 in pot). That would be 2 BB raise. That's small. Could we go all-in? Not needed. Likely we should just check and see flop cheap, because we have low stack but also low equity. However we could also try to isolate and maybe get a chance to win small pot.

Actually seat1 posted SB 2, seat5 posted BB 4. So SB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 294 chips. So they are the only other active player. Preflop action: SB posted 2 (small blind), BB posted 4 (big blind). No raise, so we are facing a call of 2 to complete the blind. So amount to call = 2 (to call SB's 2). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total, meaning raise by 4). We have 9d7s, a marginal hand. In BB vs SB, typical strategy: with 9-7 offsuit, it's a weak hand. Since we are out of position postflop (SB will act first), we should likely fold unless we have some reason to call (like defend blind). But 9d7s is not a good hand to defend. However stack depth is 62 BB, but still not worth risking blind with such weak hand.\n\nWe could consider calling to see flop cheap, but we are out of position and hand is weak. The pot odds: pot currently 6 (SB 2 + BB 4). To call 2 more, we get 6+2=8 pot? Actually after call, pot would be 8 (2+4+2). So we invest 2 to win 8, pot odds 4:1. Hand equity needed ~20% to break even. 9d7s vs random? Roughly 12% preflop vs random. So not profitable. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

In BB, with such weak hand, likely fold to raise. Check is fine. However consider opponent's stack: MiniMax-M2 has 78 chips (9.75 BB). They are short stacked. They just called SB, likely will be aggressive or maybe shove later. We could check and maybe see flop, but we risk being out of position vs short stack who may shove later.

MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) called the BB for 8, so there are three players in the pot: SB 4 (maybe hasn't acted? Actually SB posted 4, but hasn't acted yet? In preflop order: SB posts, BB posts, then action starts with UTG (seat1?) Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, but seat1 posted SB. So seat1 is SB. Then seat3 is BB. Then seat4 is MiniMax-M2, who called 8. Now it's button (us) to act, amount to call 8. So we have a pot of 20 (SB 4 + BB 8 + call 8 = 20). We can fold, call, raise to at least 16 (minimum raise total). Our stack 264, so raise possible.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 seems to call small amounts often, sometimes folds, sometimes bets small. Not much aggression. DeepSeek-V3.2 unknown. SB Kimi-K2 Thinking unknown.\n\nPocket eights is a medium pair, about 10% equity vs random. In multi-way, likely not great. But we are in position (button) and can see flop. Could call to see flop. Raise could isolate but we risk being 3-betted? Actually there is no raise yet, just call. If we raise to 16 (total) that's a 8 raise over call? Actually min raise is 16 total, which is 8 more than call (call 8). So raise to 16 would be a raise of 8 more, making pot 28 (plus 8 from us). That would isolate against MiniMax maybe, but SB and BB could also call.\n\nGiven our hand, maybe best to call and see flop. Pot odds: call 8 to win 20+8=28? Actually if we call, pot becomes 28 (20+8). Equity needed ~28% to be break even. Pocket eights vs 2 random opponents ~ maybe 30%? Might be borderline. But we have position, can fold later.\n\nRaising could get folds from SB and BB (they have already posted blinds, they could fold). MiniMax may fold as well. Might isolate to heads-up vs BB (DeepSeek). BB unknown but could be tight. If we raise, we risk being re-raised? No further raises possible preflop? Actually after us, action goes to SB then BB. So they could call or raise. If they raise, we could fold.\n\nGiven we have decent stack and want to accumulate chips, maybe raise to isolate BB? But BB posted blind, might defend wide.\n\nI think best is to call, see flop.\n\nThus action: call.\n\n",

The raise is small (2.5 BB) and a short stack (MiniMax) has already called, indicating potential all\u2011in pressure later. Calling gives us good pot odds (12 to call for a ~64 chip pot, ~19% equity needed) and lets us see a flop to hit a set, which could win a large pot against both opponents. Raising would not isolate effectively with only a minimal increase and could commit more chips without clear advantage.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have pocket eights on BTN, 32 BB stack, facing a raise from DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) after small blind and big blind posted and MiniMax called, then we called, then SB folded, then DeepSeek raised to 20 (so from 8 to 20, a raise of 12). Now MiniMax (seat 4) called 12 to 20. So we are facing a 12 call to 20 raise, amount to call is 12 (to match 20). Minimum raise to 32 (so raise at least to 32 total). Our stack is 256, we can raise.\n\nWe need to decide: pocket eights is a decent hand, but in early position (DeepSeek) raised, and a short stack (MiniMax) called. MiniMax is 58 chips (7.25 BB). So MiniMax likely will be all-in or call with any pair. They already called 12 (so they are now at 20 total, have 38 left). They could be all-in later. DeepSeek's raise size is small (2.5 BB). This is a typical open-raise from UTG? Not sure position. But they raised to 20 (2.5 BB) which is small, maybe a wide range.\n\nWe have 8-8, a medium pocket pair. With 32 BB, we could consider 3-betting to isolate and build pot. However, deep stack is 344 chips (42.9 BB). MiniMax is short 58 chips. If we 3-bet, we may isolate MiniMax (who already called) and DeepSeek. But we could also just call and see flop.\n\nGiven pocket pair, we could 3-bet to maybe 80-100 to isolate. But we have 32 BB, raising to 32 (minimum) would be a 12 raise (to total 32). That's 12 more chips (so we put total 32). That would be a 2.5x raise (from 20 to 32). That's not much; could be considered a re-raise (3-bet) but small.\n\nWe could also go all-in (256) but that's too large.\n\nWhat about opponent tendencies: DeepSeek raises vary from 5 to 100. They have raised 72 in hand 42, also 100 in hand 27. So they sometimes raise big, but also small. Not enough data.\n\nMiniMax is short stack; they called. Likely they have decent hand (maybe pair). With 8-8, we have good equity vs overpairs (like AA, KK) not great, but vs lower pairs we are ahead.\n\nGiven tournament, preserving stack is important. 8-8 is a good hand to call and see flop. But raising could isolate and possibly win bigger pot if we hit set.\n\nConsider pot odds: pot is 52, plus 12 call to call = 64 total after call. If we call, we invest 12 to potentially win 64 (pot after call). That's 12/64 = 18.75% required equity, we have > 20% (approx 20% vs random). So call is fine.\n\nBut also there is a short stack, which could go all-in later. If we call and get set, we can get big chips.\n\nThus I think best is to call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Choose call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So we have middle pair, not overpair (overpair would be higher than board, but board highest is 6). Pair of 8 is top pair? Yes highest pair on board is 8 vs 6,4,3. So we have top pair, decent. Opponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) is in BB, they raised preflop to 20 (from 8) then we called. So they are likely 3-bett? Actually they raised after our call? Let's parse: Preflop actions: SB posted 4 (seat1). BB posted 8 (seat3). Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) call 8 (small blind? Actually seat4 is MP? He is in early position? Not important). Seat5 (us) call 8. Then seat1 fold. Then seat3 raise 20 (so BB raises to 20 after the initial call? Actually seat3 posted 8 blind, then after call they raise to 20). So they raise. Seat4 call 12 (so they call the raise, adding 12 more). Seat5 call 12 (we call). So preflop we called a raise from BB, so we are in a pot with two opponents: seat3 (BB) and seat4 (MiniMax-M2). On flop, seat3 checks, seat4 bets 30 into pot of 94 (so pot after bet is 124). Seat4 is short stack 28 chips total, but they bet 30? Wait seat4 stack is 28 chips before action? Actually seat4 stack is 28 chips, but they bet 30? That seems impossible; maybe they are all-in for 28? But they bet 30, maybe they have more chips? The description says seat4: 28 chips. So they cannot bet 30, maybe they are all-in for 28, but bet shown as 30? Could be rounding. Might be they are short stacked and go all-in for 28, which is less than the minimum raise of 60, but they are allowed to go all-in. So seat4 is effectively all-in for 28 (or 30). The pot before bet: 94. If they are all-in for 28, the total pot becomes 94+28=122. The amount to call is 30 (they bet 30). We have to decide call, fold, or raise.\n\nOur hand: 8-8, top pair, decent kicker (8's). Board is 3-6-4, possible straight draws? Board has 3-4-6, possible draws 5-7? Actually a straight would be 2-5-7? Let's see combos: Straight possibilities: 2-5-7? Not contiguous. For a straight, need 5-7-8? Board 3-4-6, you need 2-5-7-8? Not immediate. The board is low, no flush possibilities (two spades). We have no spade. Opponent could have 5-7 for open-ended straight draw? Actually 5-7 would give straight 3-4-5-6-7 (needs 5 and 7). So they could have 5-7 combos. Also 2-5 would give 2-3-4-5-6 straight. So there are straight draws. Opponent could have A2 for wheel? Not relevant.\n\nSeat4 is short stack, likely shoving all-in. They bet 30 (all-in). We need to decide if we call. Our stack 244 chips, so we can call 30. Pot odds: we need to call 30 to win pot of about 122 (if we call). So equity needed = 30/(30+122) = 30/152 \u2248 19.7%. So we need about 20% equity. Our hand vs opponent's range: Opponent is short stack, likely shoving with any pair, maybe any Ace, maybe draws. Our pair of eights is decent. Against a random hand, we have >50% equity. Against a range of possible hands: Could be any pair, any Ace, any straight draw, maybe some two overcards. Likely we are ahead of many.\n\nWe also have seat3 still in hand, they checked. So we have two opponents: seat3 could call seat4's all-in? Actually seat4's bet is all-in; seat3 can call or fold.

Opponents: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) is the BB who raised preflop to 20 (from 8). So they raised 20 (maybe 2.5x BB). Then seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 12 (so they are in big blind? Actually seat 4 is out). Wait seat 4 had 0 chips (out). But they are listed as having 0 chips (out). However they are still in actions? In preflop they posted sb 4 (seat1) and bb 8 (seat3). Seat4 call 8? But seat4 has 0 chips (out) weird. Possibly seat4 is a placeholder for a player that folded preflop? Actually they call 8 preflop, then after raise, they call 12. So they are still in. So seat4 is a player with 0 chips? Might be a mistake. Anyway seat4 is the one who bet 30 on flop, then called 28 after raise. So seat4 is the original small blind? Actually seat1 is SB, seat3 is BB, seat4 is maybe UTG? Not sure. But seat4 bet 30 on flop, then call 28 after raise. So seat4 is the initial bettor, likely a short stack (0 chips?) but they bet 30, meaning they have chips. Anyway we have to decide.\n\nCurrent pot: 242 pre-flop? Actually pot after flop actions: preflop pot: blinds 4+8=12, plus seat4 call 8, seat5 call 8, seat3 raise 20, seat4 call 12, seat5 call 12 => total? Let's compute: initial blinds 4+8=12. Then seat4 call 8 adds 8 => 20. Seat5 call 8 adds 8 => 28. Seat3 raise 20 adds 20 (makes his total 20? Actually raise to 20 means he adds 12 more? Not important). Then seat4 call 12 adds 12 => 40. Seat5 call 12 adds 12 => 52. So preflop pot maybe 12+8+8+20+12+12 = 72? But the given pot is 242, maybe includes some previous? Anyway.\n\nFlop actions: seat3 check, seat4 bet 30 (so pot becomes 272). Seat5 call 30 (adds 30). Seat3 raise 90 (so adds 60 more beyond call? Actually to raise to 90 total, need to put 90-30=60). Seat4 call 28 (so they call the additional 60? Actually they call 28, meaning they put 28 more to match 90? Wait they had already contributed 30, so to call 90 they need 60 more, but they call 28? Something off. But given amount to call is 60, meaning we need to call 60 to match seat3's raise. Minimum raise to 150. So we have to decide.\n\nSeat3 (DeepSeek) raised to 90 on flop after seat4's bet. So seat3 is likely representing a strong hand or a draw. Seat4 is a short stack? They bet 30, then called 28 after raise, meaning they are now all-in? Not sure.\n\nOur hand overpair is strong but vulnerable to sets (3,6,4). No set on board currently. Potential draws: seat3 could have a straight draw like 5-7 (open-ended) or 2-5 (gutshot) or a flush draw (spades). They have no spades, but board has two spades; they could have two spades for flush draw. They could also have a pair like 6 or 4 or 3, but they'd likely just call. They raised, indicating strength or draw.\n\nWe have 214 chips, stack 26.8 BB. The pot now is 242 + 30 + 30 + 90? Actually after seat3 raise, pot maybe around 242+30+30+90 = 392? The amount to call is 60, so if we call we invest 60, making pot ~452. Pot odds: 60 to win ~452 => 13% required. Our hand likely best vs many draws, but we risk"

Also Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 0 chips? Actually seat 4 is out? It says 0 chips (out). But actions show seat 4 called flop and then called raise. But they have 0 chips? Probably they are still in with some chips? But stack not listed. Probably seat 4 is still in but with unknown stack. However after flop, seat 4 called raise 28 (call of 90 raise?). Wait flop actions: Seat 3 check, Seat 4 bet 30, Seat5 call, Seat3 raise 90 (so to 120 total? Actually raise 90 likely means raise to 90? But min raise 60). Then seat4 call 28 (so they call additional 28 to match raise). Seat5 call 60 (so they call additional 60). So after flop, pot: initial pot 302 + flop bet 30+call30+raise? Let's compute: Preflop pot: 4+8+8+8+... Actually preflop: blinds 4+8, seat4 call 8, seat5 call 8, seat3 raise to 20 (so add 12 more), seat4 call 12 (so add 4?), seat5 call 12 (add 4). So pot after preflop: 4+8+8+8 + (20-8)?? Let's not needed.\n\nNow on turn, seat3 (DeepSeek) checks. Amount to call 0. Minimum raise 60. We have 154 chips. So we could check or raise. Need to consider opponent tendencies. We have no data on DeepSeek's raise patterns on flop (they raised after a bet). Actually they raised on flop after seat4 bet 30. So they are aggressive.

Opponent might have 5x for trips, or a straight draw (2 or 7). They could have a hand like 7-8 for straight? Actually board 3-4-5-6, a 7 would give straight 3-4-5-6-7. So 7 is straight. Also a 2 gives 2-3-4-5-6 straight. So opponent could have 7x or 2x. Also could have 5x for trips. Also could have a set? No set possible because no pair on board earlier. Could have 6x for trips? Board has 6s, so if they have 6? Only one 6 on board, they could have 6? That would be two pair (6s and maybe something else). Actually board now 3,4,5,6,5. So they could have 5 for trips.

That's decent but board also has potential for straight draws that might have completed: if opponent had 2-7, they could have straight on river? Let's see: board after turn: 3h 6s 4s 5d (turn unknown? Actually board: 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d, so turn was 4d? Wait board shows 5 cards: 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So turn card is 5d? No order: flop: 3h 6s 4s. Turn: 5d. River: 4d. So river paired the board with another 4. So final board: 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So there are three 4s? Actually there are two 4s: 4s on flop, 4d on river. So pair of 4s. No three of a kind. So we have two pair: 8s and 4s.\n\nPotential opponent hands: Could have a straight: 2-7? Board after turn: 3-4-5-6. If opponent had 2-7, they'd have a straight on the turn (2-3-4-5-6) or (3-4-5-6-7) depending. After river, the 4d gives board a pair, but straight still exists if they have 2-7? Actually if they have 2-7, they have 2-3-4-5-6 (a 6-high straight) using 2 and board 3-4-5-6. That's still a straight; river 4d doesn't affect. Or 7-8? 7-8 would give 4-5-6-7-8 straight using 7 and 8? But we have 8s but opponent could have 7-? Actually board has 3,4,5,6,4. For a straight, need 2-6 or 3-7. 7-8 would need 4-5-6-7-8, but board only has 4-5-6, missing 7. So need 7 in hand and 8? Wait 8 is not on board. So 7-8 would give 4-5-6-7-8 using 7 and 8, but board has 4-5-6, yes that makes straight 4-5-6-7-8. So opponent could have 7-8 (any suits). That would be a straight, beating our two pair. Also opponent could have 2-? 2-? Actually 2-? with 2 and something else? For straight 2-3-4-5-6 need 2 and something else (like 2 and any other). So 2-? any card not making higher straight. So opponent could have 2-? (like 2-9) and have straight 2-3-4-5-6.\n\nAlso they could have a full house? Board has pair of 4s. If opponent holds a 4, they'd have trips (three 4s) or full house if they also have a pair in hand? Not possible. They could have 4x making three of a kind (4s). That's better than two pair.\n\nCould have a set of 3s? No board only one 3. So set not possible.\n\nCould have a flush? No three of same suit.\n\nSo opponent's range: They raised preflop from BB (Seat 3) to 20, called by others, then on flop they checked, then bet 30 (Seat 4? Actually flop: Seat 3 check, Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 call 30, Seat 3 raise 90, Seat 4 call 28, Seat 5 call 60). Wait seat 4 is out? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2 with 0 chips (out). But"

They posted SB 4, then called 4 (so they just called). So preflop we are in BB, opponent just called SB. No raise yet. We can check or raise. Hand 7T unsuited. In BB vs a caller from SB, typical strategy: 7T is a decent hand for a raise in early position? But we are in BB, can raise to 16 min (i.e., 8 more). Our stack 222, deep enough. Consider opponent tendencies: from recall, MiniMax has raised small amounts (4,8) and also a big raise (48) and 28. They seem to raise sometimes but also call. Not enough data. In this hand they just called. So they may be passive. 7T suited? No, unsuited. Hand is moderate, can raise to isolate and take pot. In tournament early stage, stack 27.8 BB, we can be aggressive. Raise to 24 maybe? Minimum raise is 16 (total). Could raise to 24 (i.e., 8 more). Might be fine.\n\nCheck is also possible to see flop cheap. But 7T has some equity vs random. Raising may get folds and win blinds. I'd raise to 24 (total) to apply pressure. Reason: isolate, build pot with decent hand.\n\nThus action: raise 24.\n\n",

Actually seat5 is SB. Seat1 is BB? Wait seat numbers: seat5 is SB (us). seat1 posted SB 4, seat1 also posted BB 8? Actually line: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4, Seat1 post_bb 8. So seat1 is BB. Seat3 raise 28 (so from seat3, which is UTG? Table seats: seat2 folded, seat3 is next after BB, so that's UTG?

So we are facing a raise? Actually amount to call is 8 (big blind). That means no raise yet; we can call 8 (i.e., just match big blind) or raise min to 16 (total). So it's a standard open-raise scenario: we are on button, we have QJ offsuit (Jd Qs). Hand strength moderate. Should we raise? Consider opponent tendencies: we have recall of Kimi-K2 Thinking raise amounts: they have raised 6 (which is 1.5 BB?), 28, 12, 12, 24. Those are preflop raises from SB? The amounts likely total amount they raised to? Not sure. In this hand, the SB posted 4, so a raise of 12 would be total 12? Actually min raise is 16 total (i.e., 8 to call + 8 raise). So typical raise size maybe 2.5 BB (20) or 3 BB (24). The opponent seems to raise various amounts, sometimes 12 (which is 1.5 BB? Actually 12 total includes blind? Not sure). But they have raised 12 twice, 24 once, 28 once, 6 once. So they sometimes do small raises, sometimes larger.\n\nWe have decent hand for button, could open raise to steal blinds. Stack depth 29 BB, we can afford raise. Considering tournament, we want to accumulate chips; QJ offsuit is decent but not premium; but on button, can raise to apply pressure. Opponent SB may call or 3-bet? Their stack 248 chips (approx 31 BB). They may be tight? Not enough info.\n\nGiven we are on button with 29 BB, we can raise to 24 (3 BB) to apply pressure. That seems standard.\n\nThus action: raise to 24. Reasoning: position, hand decent, steal blinds, opponent likely folds to raise.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Action: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, SB folded, we (BTN) raise to 24 (so raise 24 total? Actually raise amount: we posted 24 total, which is 3x big blind). Then BB (DeepSeek-V3.2) raises to 64 (so re-raise). Amount to call is 40 (to match 64). Minimum raise to 104 (i.e., raise at least to 104 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide.\n\nOur hand Jd Qs off-suit, in BTN. Against BB who just 3-bet to 64 (which is 8 BB). Our stack is 210, we have 210-24=186 left after our raise. To call we need 40 chips, leaving ~146 after call. To 3-bet further would be raising to at least 104 total (i.e., additional 40). So a 4-bet would be 104 total, which is 40 more than current 64, meaning we would need to add 40 chips (total put in 104). That's about 5.2 BB. So 4-bet size relative to 3-bet is 104/64 = 1.625 times, which is about 1.6x the 3-bet, typical 4-bet size maybe 2.5-3x the 3-bet for deep stacks. But we have a short stack (26 BB). JQ offsuit is not a strong 4-bet candidate; it's a marginal hand, maybe a call or fold depending on opponent's tendencies.\n\nWe need to recall opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 has raised various amounts preflop: small raises (5-12) and some larger (100, 72, 28). So they sometimes 3-bet large (100) maybe when they have strong hands. In this situation, they 3-bet to 64 after our 24 raise. That's a 2.66x raise (64/24). That's a standard 3-bet size for a short stack (maybe 3x). Could be strong or semi-bluff.\n\nOur hand JQ offsuit is a decent hand for a call in position against a short stack, but also could be a fold if we think they only 3-bet strong. Considering we have 26 BB, we could call and see flop, but we risk being dominated by AK, AQ, KQ, etc. JQ suited would be better, but off-suit is weaker.\n\nPot odds: To call 40 into pot 92+40 (current pot after raise?) Actually pot before call includes our 24 raise and BB's 64 raise? Let's compute: initial pot 4+8=12. We raise to 24 (so we add 24, but we already posted SB 4? Actually we are BTN, not SB, we raise 24 total, meaning we put 24 chips. So pot after our raise: 12 + 24 = 36? Wait we need to be careful: The pot before any action: SB 4, BB 8 = 12. Then we raise to 24, meaning we put 24 chips (we didn't have any blind). So pot becomes 12+24=36. Then BB re-raises to 64, adding extra 56 (since they already had 8). So pot becomes 36+56=92. That's the pot shown: 92 chips. Yes.\n\nNow amount to call is 40 (to match 64). If we call, the total pot after call will be 92+40=132. So pot odds: need to call 40 to win 132, i.e., 30% equity needed. JQ offsuit vs unknown range: if opponent's 3-bet range is maybe 10% of hands (including strong combos). JQ off-suit is likely bottom of that range, maybe 1% equity? Actually JQ off-suit vs typical 3-bet range (like TT+, AK, AQ, maybe some suited connectors) is around 20%? Let's approximate: vs TT+, AK, AQ, maybe also AJs, KQs, maybe some suited connectors. JQ offsuit likely around 15% equity. That's below required 30%, so not a good call.\n\nThus folding is advisable.\n\nBut also consider stack preservation: we have 26 BB, need to preserve chips. Folding loses 24 chips (our raise) but we already invested that; we can fold now and preserve stack. If we call, we risk being in a big pot out of position.\n\nThus"

Folding loses 24 chips (our raise) but we already invested that; we can fold now and preserve stack. If we call, we risk being in a big pot out of position.\n\nThus",

In BTN, standard opening range includes Q9s. With 24.8 BB, we can raise to maybe 2.5x BB (20) or 3x (24). Since minimum raise is 16, raising to 20-24 is fine.

The opponent MiniMax just called preflop, likely a decent hand but unknown. 7Ts is a marginal hand; in SB we are out of position postflop. With 24 BB stack, we could consider raising to isolate, but raise to 16 min raise (total). That would be a raise to 16 total (i.e., additional 12). Is that advisable? 7Ts is not a strong hand to raise from SB, especially against a player who just called (maybe a wide range). Raising could isolate but also commit more chips. Could also just call and see flop out of position. The pot odds: we need to call 4 to see flop, pot is 20, effective pot after call 24, pot odds ~ 4/24 = 16.7% required. Hand equity vs unknown range? 7Ts vs a calling range (maybe 8-? Actually MiniMax called from MP maybe with broad range). 7Ts suited? It's offsuit hearts. So equity maybe around 30% vs random.

Not sure.\n\nWe are short stack? 24 BB, not extremely short. In tournament early stage, preserve chips. Hand is weak, not a good candidate to raise unless we think they will fold. Since they checked preflop, maybe they have a weak hand. But board is Ace high, they could have Ace, Q, etc. Raising could be risky but small raise maybe fine. But if they have Ace they may call.

Our stack 190, call 102 would leave 88 chips left. That's about 5.5 BB. That is a very short stack; maybe we want to go all-in? But cannot raise. Call would be effectively going all-in? Actually call 102 leaves 88, not all-in. So we would be short stacked after call. Is that okay? Could consider folding to preserve stack, but maybe we can call to see flop with suited connector and hope to double up. However 6c7d is not premium; against unknown opponent raise (maybe deep). Our stack is short, we could also consider folding to preserve chips for better spots. In tournament with 190 chips, 11.9 BB, we are short. If we fold, we have 190 still. If we call, we will be at 88 chips. If we lose, we are out. The raise size is large (118) relative to blinds (8/16). That's 7.4 BB raise. That suggests opponent is strong.

In BB, we already posted 16. Opponent seat1 posted SB 8. So we are out of position vs SB. Opponent SB has 412 chips, larger stack.\n\nWe face a raise? Actually actions: seat5 post_sb 8 (that's SB posting 8?), Wait seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Actually blinds: 8/16, seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB. So seat5 posted SB 8? That seems reversed. But given \"preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 8\" indicates seat5 posted small blind, but seat5 is BB seat? Might be seat ordering weird. But they say \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So seat5 is BB, but they posted SB 8? Might be a mistake. Then seat1 posted BB 16. So seat5 is SB? Actually seat5 is BB but posted SB? Anyway, amount to call is 8, meaning we need to call 8 to match BB? Likely SB posted 8, BB posted 16, and now we need to call 8 more? Actually if we are BB, we have already posted 16, so amount to call would be 0. But they say amount to call: 8. So maybe seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB? But they say Position: BB. Something off. However legal actions: fold, call, raise. So we have to decide.\n\nGiven hand 6h5s, with 11 BB effective, we could consider a raise (steal) but it's weak. SB raise to 32 min raise, but we are the BB? Actually min raise to 32. So we could raise to 32 (total). That would be a 16 raise (since we already have 16). But we have only 182 chips, still fine.\n\nBut typical strategy: With 6-5 suited, you could limp or call the blind? In 11 BB stack, you might want to see a cheap flop. The SB is short stack? Actually SB has 412 chips, larger. So calling 8 to see flop is cheap. However being out of position post-flop is disadvantage. But hand has potential.\n\nGiven tournament, preserve chips, but also need to accumulate. 6-5 suited is marginal. I think best to call (just see flop) rather than raise and risk. So action: call 8.\n\nCheck legal: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So we face BB's 16, can call 16 to see flop, or raise min to 32. Pocket pairs low, but can call to see flop cheaply. Stack 174, can afford raise. Consider opponent: BB is DeepSeek-V3.2 with 126 chips, somewhat short stack. Might be willing to shove. But we are BTN, can raise to isolate. Pocket fours have low equity vs many hands, but can be good against overpairs? Not great. With 10.9 BB, typical push/fold range includes all pairs? In tournament early stage, with 10 BB, push/fold is common. But we have 174 chips, could push all-in (raise to 174). Minimum raise is 32, but we could go all-in. Should we? Pocket fours are not premium; risk of being dominated. However, opponent short stack may shove anyway; calling might be okay. Since we have 10 BB, many players push all-in. Our best is to raise all-in to put pressure; if they call, we are a slight underdog but okay. If they fold, we pick up blinds.\n\nThus action: raise to 174 (all-in). Provide reasoning.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise allowed. So output.",

Since amount to call is 0, raising to 16 means bet 16). Pot 32, betting 16 is 0.5 pot. Could be okay as a probe.\n\nBut we need to consider tournament stage: we have 300 chips, 18.8 BB, relatively short. Preserving chips important. If we bet and get raised, could be trouble. Opponent's tendencies unknown; recall shows no raise actions on flop. So they may not be aggressive. Could just check again.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, best to check and see turn. No bet needed. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. So choose check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #66 turn. Our hand: 8h Qs. Board: Kd 3d Ad Ts. So board shows K, A, T, 3, all diamonds except Kd, 3d, Ad are diamonds, Ts is spade. Actually board: Kd (diamond), 3d (diamond), Ad (diamond), Ts (spade). So three diamonds on board: Kd, 3d, Ad. Our hand: 8h Qs. No diamond, so we have no flush draw (we have 0 diamonds). Straight possibilities: board has A K T 3. Potential straight draws? With Q we have A K Q T = Broadway straight (A K Q J T) missing J. We have Q, but need J. No J. Also we have 8, not relevant. So we have a gutshot straight draw: need J for straight. Also we have pair of Q? No board Q, so we have overpair to board? Actually board has K, A, T. Our Q is lower than K and A, but higher than T? Q is between K and J? Actually rank order: A K Q J T. So Q is third highest. We have top pair? No board doesn't have Q, so we have a pair of Qs (we have Qs). That's a pair, but board has higher cards A and K, so we have a \"pair, but likely behind\". So hand strength moderate: pair of Qs, plus gutshot straight draw to A K Q J T. Also potential backdoor flush? No diamonds in hand, board has 3 diamonds, we have no diamond, so no flush draw.\n\nOpponent: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has checked on turn. So pot 32. No bet. We can check or raise. What are opponent tendencies? From recall, we see that MiniMax-M2 sometimes checks on turn, sometimes bets small (4), sometimes bets larger (20). They have called raises etc. Hard to infer.\n\nOur stack 300, pot 32. Minimum raise 16. So raise to 16 (i.e., raise 16 total). That would be a raise of 16 (since call is 0). Actually raise_to = total amount we put in, so raise to 16 means we bet 16.\n\nWe need to decide: check or raise? Consider: we have a decent hand (pair of Q) but behind A and K. Opponent could have A, K, T, etc. If we check, we give free card (river) which is a 9? Actually river unknown. Could be J giving us straight, but also could be something else.\n\nRaising could protect against draws? Opponent's range likely includes A, K, T, maybe draws. Since board has three diamonds, opponent could have flush draw (if they have two diamonds). But they have no diamond in hand (we don't know). They could have a diamond draw, they'd bet. They checked, maybe they have weak hand or draw.\n\nRaising small could extract value from worse hands like lower pairs, draws, or even force folds. But raising could also scare off draws.\n\nGiven we are short stack 18.8 BB, not huge but not extremely short. Raising 16 will commit ~5% of stack, okay.\n\nI think raise to 48? Minimum raise is 16. Could raise bigger to apply pressure. But we have limited info. Probably just check to see river.\n\nBut we have a gutshot and a pair; maybe we want to see river cheap. Check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Th7c is not premium but can be used as a steal. However opponents may call with wide ranges. Might be okay to raise to 48 (3x BB) to apply pressure. But short stack, want to preserve chips. Could just call and see flop? But calling 16 for 40 pot gives us 2.5:1 odds, but hand is weak. Better to raise as a steal. Minimum raise to 32 yields 32 total bet, pot becomes 24+32=56, effective stack for opponents? SB 412 chips can call 32, BB 230 can call 32. Might be okay.

          "content": "We have hand #71 preflop, BTN with 5d9d, stack 292 (18.2 BB). Blinds 8/16, SB posted 8, BB posted 16. So pot 24. To act, amount to call 16 (BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise of 16 more). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength, position, stack, opponent tendencies. Opponent seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is BB with 230 chips. Look at recall: many folds, some calls, some raises. In hand 59 they raised to 32 preflop (so a raise of 16). That suggests they sometimes raise from BB (maybe 3-bet? Actually they are BB, so they could raise as open-raise). In hand 67 they called 16 then bet 16 on flop. In hand 70 they called 16 then bet 16 flop. So they sometimes call and then bet. Not many raises. They seem to be a calling player, sometimes betting on flop after calling.\n\nOur hand 5d9d is weak, suited connectors but low. In BTN, we could consider stealing blind. But stack is relatively shallow (18 BB). The BB is 230 chips, about 12 BB. Actually 230 chips is about 12.9 BB. So we are short stacked relative to blinds? Our stack 292 (~18 BB). The BB's stack is smaller relative to us? Actually BB has 230 chips (~12.9 BB). So they are short too. The SB has 412 chips (~23 BB). So we are in a short stack scenario; raising may be good to steal blinds, but we have a weak hand.\n\nWe need to consider tournament considerations: preserving chips vs. accumulating. With 5d9d, it's not a good hand to raise; risk of being 3-bet? But BB may 3-bet rarely. In recall, they raised only once (hand 59) preflop to 32. That could be a 3-bet or open-raise from BB? Since we are BTN, they are BB; the only raise possible is 3-bet after SB's post? Actually SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then BTN acts. If we raise, it's a raise of 16 to 32 total? Actually minimum raise to 32 means we put total 32 chips, which is 2x BB. That's a standard raise.\n\nIf we call 16, we see flop with 5d9d, which is not strong but could have flush/straight draws.\n\nGiven our stack 18 BB, we could consider a raise to try to steal. But 5d9d is not a premium hand; but in short stack situations, you can raise with a wide range. However, the BB is also short; they may call with any two cards. If they call, we will be in a multi-way? Only SB and BB left; SB already posted 8, but hasn't acted yet (they are out of position). Actually SB posted 8, but after us, action goes to SB (seat1) then to BB (seat4) if we raise. If we just call, SB will act after us (they are first to act preflop after BTN). Wait order: SB (seat1) posted 8, then BB (seat4) posted 16, then BTN (us) acts, then action goes to SB (seat1) then BB (if still not acted). So we are between SB and BB. If we raise, SB can fold or call, then BB can call or 3-bet. So raising might get called by both short stacks.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, perhaps we should fold. But with 18 BB, folding many hands may be okay. Yet we are in BTN, we could attempt a steal with a wider range. 5d9d is not suited to the SB's range? Might be okay to raise as a steal. The SB's stack is 412 (~23 BB), they may defend with wide range. The BB's stack is 230 (~12.9 BB) and they may call with any. So raising could be risky.\n\nWe need to decide. Considering hand strength low, and both opponents are short stacks (likely to call or go all-in), I think folding is safest. Also we could call and see flop, but 5d9d doesn't have high equity preflop; calling 16 with 18 BB is okay but we risk being out of position post-flop. But we are in BTN, after flop we will be first to act (since SB is before BB). Actually after flop, action starts with SB then BB then BTN. So we will be last, which is good. However we have no strong hand.\n\nGiven we have 292"

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #71 preflop, BTN with 5d9d, stack 292 (18.2 BB). Blinds 8/16, SB posted 8, BB posted 16. So pot 24. To act, amount to call 16 (BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise of 16 more). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength, position, stack, opponent tendencies. Opponent seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is BB with 230 chips. Look at recall: many folds, some calls, some raises. In hand 59 they raised to 32 preflop (so a raise of 16). That suggests they sometimes raise from BB (maybe 3-bet? Actually they are BB, so they could raise as open-raise). In hand 67 they called 16 then bet 16 on flop. In hand 70 they called 16 then bet 16 flop. So they sometimes call and then bet. Not many raises. They seem to be a calling player, sometimes betting on flop after calling.\n\nOur hand 5d9d is weak, suited connectors but low. In BTN, we could consider stealing blind. But stack is relatively shallow (18 BB). The BB is 230 chips, about 12 BB. Actually 230 chips is about 12.9 BB. So we are short stacked relative to blinds? Our stack 292 (~18 BB). The BB's stack is smaller relative to us? Actually BB has 230 chips (~12.9 BB). So they are short too. The SB has 412 chips (~23 BB). So we are in a short stack scenario; raising may be good to steal blinds, but we have a weak hand.\n\nWe need to consider tournament considerations: preserving chips vs. accumulating. With 5d9d, it's not a good hand to raise; risk of being 3-bet? But BB may 3-bet rarely. In recall, they raised only once (hand 59) preflop to 32. That could be a 3-bet or open-raise from BB? Since we are BTN, they are BB; the only raise possible is 3-bet after SB's post? Actually SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then BTN acts. If we raise, it's a raise of 16 to 32 total? Actually minimum raise to 32 means we put total 32 chips, which is 2x BB. That's a standard raise.\n\nIf we call 16, we see flop with 5d9d, which is not strong but could have flush/straight draws.\n\nGiven our stack 18 BB, we could consider a raise to try to steal. But 5d9d is not a premium hand; but in short stack situations, you can raise with a wide range. However, the BB is also short; they may call with any two cards. If they call, we will be in a multi-way? Only SB and BB left; SB already posted 8, but hasn't acted yet (they are out of position). Actually SB posted 8, but after us, action goes to SB (seat1) then to BB (seat4) if we raise. If we just call, SB will act after us (they are first to act preflop after BTN). Wait order: SB (seat1) posted 8, then BB (seat4) posted 16, then BTN (us) acts, then action goes to SB (seat1) then BB (if still not acted). So we are between SB and BB. If we raise, SB can fold or call, then BB can call or 3-bet. So raising might get called by both short stacks.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, perhaps we should fold. But with 18 BB, folding many hands may be okay. Yet we are in BTN, we could attempt a steal with a wider range. 5d9d is not suited to the SB's range? Might be okay to raise as a steal.

Wait blinds: SB seat5 posted 8 (but seat5 is us? Actually actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 8. So we posted small blind. Seat1 post_bb 16. So seat1 is big blind. So we are SB, not BB. Actually position says BB (Seat5) but actions show seat5 posted sb. So maybe seat5 is BB but posted sb? Might be reversed. But amount to call is 8, meaning we need to call 8 to match BB 16? Wait amount to call 8 suggests we are facing a raise? Actually we posted sb 8, BB is 16, amount to call is 8 (to call BB). So we are SB. So we can fold, call (8 more to 16 total) or raise min to 32 total (i.e., raise 16 more). Hand Tc8h unsuited, not great. In SB vs BB with short stacks? Our stack 292 vs 364, both deep enough. Should we limp? Usually in SB vs BB, you can call (complete) with a wide range, but with 8BB stack, calling is fine. Tc8h is a marginal hand; may be okay to call, but also could raise to isolate. However opponent's tendencies: recall shows they often call preflop (hand 74) and sometimes check/fold. They have folded many times. Not much aggression. Probably they are passive. Raising could steal BB? But they are BB, they already have 16 in pot. Raising may get them to fold many times, but they might call with wide range. Our hand is not strong enough to continue postflop against a likely call. So best is to call (complete) and see flop cheap.

We have 8 and T. Could have straight draws: we have T, board 8,6, Q. Potential straight: 9-10-J? Actually we have T, need 9-J for open-ended? Board: 8-6, we have T, so we have gutshot? 8-6, need 7 for 6-7-8? Actually we have 8, T, board 8,6,Q. We have pair eights, plus a gutshot straight draw to 9? Let's see combos: If a 9 appears, we would have 6-8-9-10? Actually we need 9 to make 6-8-9-10? Not a straight. Straight would be 8-9-10-J-Q, we have 8 and T, need 9 and J. So double gutshot? Not strong.\n\nWe have top pair? Actually opponent may have Q? They could have Q? The board has Qs, could be queen. Opponent's action: we are in BB, they checked preflop, we called, now flop check. Amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 16 (pot 32, so raise to 48?). Actually raise to total 48? Minimum raise to 48? But they say minimum raise to 16? Wait: \"Minimum raise to: 16\" maybe means raise to 16 more? But typical format: raise_to total amount. Since pot is 32, min raise would be pot+big blind? Actually preflop big blind 16, pot 32, min raise is 16? Possibly they define raise_to as total amount you put in, not additional. So raise_to = 48? Not sure. But we can raise to 48 (i.e., 16 more). Anyway.\n\nWe need to decide action. Opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 364, we have 284. They checked flop. We have pair 8, not strong but could be best. Opponent could have queen, could have 8, could have straight draws. Our hand is medium. With 17.8 BB, we can consider raising to protect and get value if they have weaker hand (like 6, 8? Actually they could have 8? they'd have set? No set would be 8? board 8s, we have 8h, so we have pair, not set. Opponent could have 8? they'd have two eights, they'd have pair of eights as well, but we have kicker T vs their kicker maybe something else.\n\nWe can also check and see next street. With 17 BB, maybe we want to preserve chips. Opponent's tendencies unknown. Could be aggressive? We have no recall data.\n\nGiven we have top pair (maybe not top if opponent has Q), but we have decent hand. Might consider a small raise to protect and get value from worse hands like 6, 7, or draws. But risk of being raised by stronger queen. However we are BB, we have position? Actually after flop, it's opponent's turn (Seat1) then us (Seat5). So we are out of position? Actually we are in BB, they are in SB? Wait seat1 posted BB, seat5 posted SB? Actually preflop: seat5 post_sb 8, seat1 post_bb 16. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB, out of position postflop (SB acts first). So we are first to act. So we can check.\n\nGiven we have medium strength, checking is safe. Raising could be good to protect against draws, but we risk being raised and losing chips. With 17 BB, I'd likely check and see.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

Board: no flush draws (two spades, Q\u2660,8\u2660). Straight draws? Board: 8,6,Q,6. Straight possibilities: 7-9? Not many. So not many draws.

Qs and 9h: not suited). So Q9 offsuit is marginal. Position button, can steal blinds. Opponents: Seat1 Kimi-K2 is SB with 356 chips, Seat4 MiniMax-M2 is BB with 262 chips. Both have some raise tendencies: Kimi-K2 raised 14 (maybe 1.75x) and 6 (maybe 0.75x) preflop in past. MiniMax-M2 raises varied: small raises 4 (maybe 0.5x), 8, 28, 32. So both can raise small.\n\nWe are on button with 19.8 BB, need to consider tournament: relatively short stack but not crisis. Steal attempt could be good. Q9 offsuit is not premium but can be used for steal. Risk: if called, we may be dominated by better hands. However, both opponents have stacks: SB 356 (22.25 BB), BB 262 (16.4 BB). If we raise to 48 (3x BB), they'd need to call. Could be fold.\n\nBut we have only 19.8 BB, raising to 48 would be 3BB, leaving 268 chips. That's okay. Minimum raise is 32 (2 BB). Raise to 48 is a 3x raise.\n\nConsider equity vs typical calling range. If they call with any pair, broadway, suited connectors, they have equity >50. Q9 offsuit vs that is low. But maybe they fold often.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe better to just call and see flop? But calling 16 will commit half stack. That seems risky.\n\nBetter to raise to 48 (3x) as steal. If called, we can evaluate flop; but we will be out of position preflop? Actually we will be first to act after flop (SB first). But we are button, after raise, action goes to SB then BB. If they call, we will be out of position.\n\nGiven Q9 offsuit, maybe we should just fold? But we have 19.8 BB, folding loses 16 chips (blinds) and we keep stack. Could be okay.\n\nBut typical button steal range includes Q9o? Many players raise with Q9o. So raise.\n\nThus decision: raise to 48 (or maybe 48 is max? Minimum raise is 32, we can raise to 48). Let's raise to 48.\n\nReasoning: attempt to steal blinds, hand decent, short stack, opponents have shown tendency to raise small but also fold to raises.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Actually raise to 32 total? The action line: \"Seat 4 raise 32\". Since SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then seat 4 raise 32 meaning they put total 32? Usually raise amount is total bet amount. So amount to call is 24 (32-8). Minimum raise to 48 (i.e., raise by at least 16 more). So options: fold, call 24 (total 32 in pot), raise to at least 48 (i.e., total 48).

Actually Q-J-T-9-8 is a straight). So if opponent holds J9, they'd have straight. Also KJ would give K Q J T 8? That's not straight. So the only straight combos are J9, 9J, maybe 7 9? 9 7 would be 9-8-7-? No, need 7 9? 9-8-7-? Not a straight. So only J9 combos make straight. Also any pair of Q, T, 8 would give trips or two pair. Our hand is currently a gutshot? Actually we have no draws; we are just a low pair. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) raised preflop to 32 (2.5 BB) from UTG? Actually seat 4. SB called, BB called. So we are out of position postflop (SB vs UTG who raised). The pot is 96. We have 316 chips stack.\n\nWe need to decide: check or raise. Opponent likely has a range: they raised preflop from UTG (maybe early position). Their range could be strong: broadways (AQ, KQ, QJ, JT), pairs (TT+, 99 maybe), suited connectors (JTs, T9s), maybe suited A's. Our hand 66 is low, likely behind. Board is Q T 8, which hits many of those combos. So we are probably behind.\n\nWe could consider checking to see if they bet, then decide to call/fold. But we have no action to call now (amount to call 0). So we can check.\n\nRaising could be a bluff but unlikely to succeed given opponent likely has strong range. Also we have limited stack, but raising might be too risky.\n\nThus best is check.\n\nWe need to output JSON with action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

They bet 112, but they only have 110? Wait stack 110, but they bet 112? Maybe they are all-in? Actually they have 110 chips, but bet 112? Might be they are short-stacked and went all-in for 110? But amount to call is 112, maybe they are overbet? Might be a typo. Anyway they likely are all-in.\n\nOur hand is weak, likely losing. Opponent could have many combos: any queen, king, ten, jack, nine for straight draws, also pair of tens, etc. Our pair of sixes is low, likely losing. So folding is best.\n\nWe need to consider tournament: we have 19.8 BB, short stack relative to blinds, need chips. But calling with a losing hand is not good. Could consider shove? We have 316, can shove all-in for 316, but opponent already all-in for 110? Actually we could call 112 and still have chips left, but likely lose.\n\nThus fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #80 preflop. Position BTN, cards 5h Ts (T5 offsuit). Stack 316 chips, blinds 8/16, pot 24 (SB+BB). Opponents: Seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted SB 8, Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) posted BB 16. We are BTN, facing a raise? Actually amount to call 16, min raise to 32. So the BB is 16, SB 8, we are to act after BB? Wait order: SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then BTN action: amount to call 16 (i.e., call BB). So no raise yet; we can call 16, raise to at least 32 (total). So legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength. T5 offsuit is a weak hand, especially in early tournament with 19.8 BB. In BTN, can consider stealing blinds, but T5o is not great for steal; typical raise range from BTN is broader maybe 20-30% but T5o is lower edge. However we have 19.8 BB, not huge but decent. Opponent tendencies: Seat1 (SB) appears to call 16 in hand 79 (preflop call). Also sometimes checks, folds. Not much raising data. Seat4 (BB) hasn't acted yet; we have no data. Could be a tight player? Not enough info.\n\nGiven weak hand, likely fold. But consider possibility of raising to steal both blinds. SB may call with wide range? In hand 79, SB called 16 (the BB) with unknown hand. Could be wide. But raising with T5o is risky because if called by BB (MiniMax-M2) who might have a stronger hand, we risk losing ~32 chips. Our stack is 316, losing 32 is ~10% of stack, not huge but could be.\n\nGiven tournament early stage, preserving stack is important. I'd fold.\n\nThus output JSON with action fold, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

That is a raise of 96 total (i.e., 64 more). That would be 3x BB (96) and 3x opponent's raise? Actually min raise is 96 total, which is 64 more than call (32). So raise to 96 = total bet 96, meaning we put 96 chips (including the 32 call). That would be 3 BB (96) vs opponent's 64 raise. Our stack 284, could also go all-in (284). But with K4 suited, not a strong hand. Should we fold? In short stack, maybe consider shove if we think opponent is stealing with wide range. But K4c is not a great hand to shove; but could be okay vs a raise from MP/CO maybe? However we have only 8.9 BB, typical push/fold threshold is about 10 BB, you can shove with a decent range, but K4c is marginal. Also opponent's raise size 64 (2 BB) over BB; that's a standard raise. Their range likely includes many broadways, suited connectors, etc. K4c is at bottom of push range. Better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

Minimum raise to 96 (i.e., raise amount total = 96). Amount to call is 48 (they raised 64, we posted 16, so need 48 more). Hand As4c is weak suited Ace low kicker. In SB, short stack 8.4 BB, need to consider fold or call? 48 call is 1.5 BB (since SB is 16 BB, but effective BB is 32). Actually 48 is 1.5 BB (relative to big blind). With 8.4 BB stack, calling 48 leaves us with 268-48=220 chips, still decent. But As4c is not great for calling a raise from MP (seat 4 maybe MP). Opponent's raise size is 64 (2 BB raise). In SB, typical open raise from MP is 2-2.5 BB. So they are raising standard. With A4s, it's a marginal hand. Could consider calling to see flop with suited Ace, maybe try to see cheap flop, but we are out of position for rest of hand. However stack is shallow, but not super short. In tournament, with 8.4 BB, we should be careful not to waste chips. A4s is not a good call; maybe fold.\n\nWe can also consider raising (3-bet) to 96 total (i.e., raise 96). That would be 96 total, which is 3 BB raise (since big blind 32). That would be 96-16 posted = 80 additional. But we have 268, can raise. But 3-bet with A4s is too weak, likely not good.\n\nThus best action: fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been raising sometimes (hand 81 raise 64 preflop). Also raised 64 in hand 81. So they are capable of raising with a range. Not a tight player. So folding is safe.\n\nThus output JSON.",

It's our turn, we face 32 to call (i.e., just the BB). Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., raise 32 more). With 8.4 BB, AQ is a strong hand, but short stack; we could go all-in (268) but raise to 64 is small. Typically with 8 BB, you either shove or call? In tournaments, with 8 BB, you could shove to maximize fold equity, but also could call to see flop if you think you have good equity. However, AQ is strong but not premium like AK or AA. Many players would shove. Also consider opponents: seat1 (Kimi) has 584 chips, seat4 (MiniMax) has 58 chips (short stack). So there is a short stack at BB with 58 chips; they are already all-in? No they posted BB 32, they still have 26 left. They could be forced to act later. If we raise, they may call or fold. With 8 BB, a raise to 64 is about 2 BB, still leaves them with enough to call. But maybe better to go all-in to maximize pressure on both. Since we have 268, all-in is 268, which is 8.4 BB, but they'd need to call 236 more. That's huge. Likely they fold. So optimal: raise all-in (i.e., raise_to 268). But check legal actions: raise is allowed, we can raise to any amount up to our stack. So choose raise to 268 (all-in).

Wait positions: Seat 5 is SB, seat 1 is BB, seat 4 is maybe UTG? Actually seat numbers not matter. The action: SB posted 16, BB posted 32, seat 4 call 32 (so they are likely under the gun? Actually they are before SB? Not needed). So pot currently: 16+32+32 = 80 (as given). Amount to call is 16 (to match BB's 32? Actually SB posted 16, BB 32, seat 4 called 32, so SB needs to call 16 to match 32). Minimum raise to 64 (so raise total to 64). With short stack 316 chips, 9.9 BB. A5 suited is a decent hand for steal? In SB vs BB and a caller. There are 3 players in pot. Stack is short but not ultra short. A5 suited has some potential but not premium. Considering we are short stack, we may want to go all-in if we raise. Minimum raise is 64, which is 2 BB. That's about 2% of stack. Could just call to see flop? But with 5\u2660 A\u2660, we have ace high, maybe decent for showdown if we hit Ace. But against 3 players, likely not.\n\nWe could consider raising to steal blinds, but there is a caller already (seat 4). That player called BB, indicating they likely have a decent hand (maybe a wide range). Raising may get called or re-raised, but we are short stack. Might be better to go all-in to maximize fold equity? Minimum raise to 64 is small; we could raise to maybe 128 or go all-in (316). But raise to 64 is not enough to pressure them; they could call cheap. Better to go all-in to put pressure and maybe win pot. With A5 suited, it's a decent hand to go all-in short stack. So action: raise to 316 (all-in). Need to ensure legal: raise is allowed, minimum raise to 64, we can raise to any amount up to stack. So raise to 316.\n\nReasoning: short stack, need to accumulate chips, A5 suited decent, steal with all-in.\n\nThus output JSON.",

He just checked from small blind. Likely will call or fold. Raising to a decent amount could isolate. At 12 BB, typical push/fold threshold is around 0.5-0.6 BB? Actually push all-in is typical at <10 BB. At 12 BB, you can still raise and maybe get called. I think best is to raise to maybe 120 (3 big blinds) to put pressure. But we have to consider we are short and want to accumulate chips. AJ is top 10% hand. I think raising to min raise 48 is too small, could be called cheaply. Better to go all-in? All-in would be 396 chips, which is about 12 BB, which is a huge bet relative to pot (26). That could force fold from many but also risk being called by bigger stack. But AJ is strong enough to risk. However typical tournament strategy: push all-in when stack <= 15 BB and have a decent hand. So I will go all-in (raise to 396). Need to set raise_to total amount.

With Td5c unsuited, not a good hand in early position (SB vs BB). Likely fold. Consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown a huge raise in hand 82 preflop (raise 276).

So we face a raise of 48 from SB, from a player \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\". Our stack 386, we can call 48 (to 48). Hand 2-9 suited is very weak. In tournament with short stack 12 BB, but still not a candidate for shove? Could consider shove (all-in) 386 vs 48 raise. But 2-9 suited is not a good shoving hand, especially against a raise from SB who may be tighter? We need opponent tendencies: recall shows raise amounts: 48, 32, 48, 200, 276. Mixed sizes. Not clear if they are aggressive. Likely they raise a range of hands, maybe wide. But 2-9 suited still low equity even vs wide range. With 12 BB, we could consider a shove if we think fold equity enough. However 2-9 suited is among worst suited connectors. In 12 BB, standard push/fold ranges on button: you can push with any suited ace, broadway, maybe any pair, and some suited connectors like 76s, 87s, maybe 65s. 2-9s is too low.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #91 preflop. Position BTN, 9d8h, stack 386 (12.1 BB). Blinds 16/32, we posted small blind 16, big blind 32 from seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking). So we are out of position post-flop (SB vs BB). Actually BTN is after BB, but we are SB? Wait seat numbers: seat5 is BTN, seat1 is BB. The blinds: small blind 16 posted by seat5 (us) and big blind 32 by seat1. So we are SB, not BTN? The description says Position: BTN (Seat5). But they also posted sb. In tournament, BTN is also SB when only 2 players left? Actually with 8 seats, BTN is seat5, small blind seat5, big blind seat1. So we are SB and also BTN (since we are the button). So we are in the small blind, out of position to BB.\n\nOur hand 9d8h is suited? No, 9d 8h unsuited. Not great.\n\nStack is shallow 12 BB. We are facing a BB of 32, we have already posted 16. To continue we need to call 16 more (to match BB). Minimum raise to 64 total (i.e., raise by 48). So we can fold, call 16, or raise to 64 (or more). With 9-8 offsuit, typical play is to fold in SB against a BB who hasn't shown aggression, especially short stack. But maybe we could raise as a steal? But we are SB, not in position. Raising may be okay to steal BB's 32, but we have only 12 BB; a raise of 64 would be 2 BB (including our 16). That's a decent raise size. However 9-8 offsuit is not a strong hand to raise; risk of being called and playing out of position. BB's tendencies: from recall, recent actions: hand 89 preflop raise 48 (i.e., raise to 48? Actually min raise is 64, but they raised 48 maybe they were in a different blind structure). Hard to interpret. In hand 89 they raised preflop. In other hands they folded or checked. So maybe they are somewhat aggressive but also fold often.\n\nGiven short stack, we might consider a shove? Minimum raise to 64 is not all-in; all-in would be 386 total (or 370 remaining after SB). But raising to 64 is a modest raise. With 9-8 off, I think fold is best.\n\nPot odds: to call 16 to win 48 (pot currently 48 + 16 call = 64). So need ~25% equity. 9-8 offsuit vs random BB range maybe ~15% equity, not enough. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

Opponent (Seat1) bet 48 into pot 112, so pot now 112+48=160 (including bet). Actually pot before bet is 112, opponent bets 48, we need to call 48 to see turn. Our stack 354, so we can call.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall shows that Kimi-K2 has bet on flop in two prior hands: amounts 4 and 15 (small relative to pot). Those were small bets. Here bet is 48, which is 0.75 BB? Wait blinds 16/32, so 48 is 1.5 BB (since BB=32). That's moderate. Might be continuation bet (c-bet). Our hand is weak, drawing. Should we call? Pot odds: call 48 to win pot of 160+48? Actually after call, pot will be 112+48+48 = 208. So call 48 for pot 208, odds = 48/208 = 23% required. Our outs: we need a 9 for straight (4 outs). Also any club for flush? We have two clubs (Qc4c), board has no clubs. There are 13 clubs total, we have 2, so 9 clubs left. Some clubs also give straight? The 9c also club gives straight and flush. So total outs: 4 nines + 9 clubs = 13, but double count 9c counted twice, so unique outs = 4+9-1 = 12. Also Ace maybe? Not relevant.\n\n12 outs, turn and river: probability to hit by river = 1 - (C(39,2)/C(47,2)) approx. Approx chance: 12/47 + (35/47)*(12/46) = 0.255+0.194=0.449 ~45%. So about 45% chance to improve to at least a straight or flush. However many of those outs give us a decent hand but may still be second best if opponent has Kx etc. Opponent's range: They called preflop from SB, so they have a wide range, likely includes broadway combos, maybe Kx, Ax, etc. Board: Kc, Td, 6h. They have bet. Could have Kx (top pair), T, 6, straight draws, etc. Our queen is a gutshot; if we hit 9 we have straight 9-T-J-Q-K? Actually board Kc Td 6h, we would have 9c making 9-10-J-Q-K? Wait we need J? Straight would be 9-10-J-Q-K but we don't have J. So 9 does not give straight. Actually need 9-10-J-Q-K? No we have Qc, need J and 9? Let's compute: board: 6, T, K. Our hand Q,4. Straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K (needs 9 and J). We only get 9, not J. So 9 does not give straight. Wait what straight does 9 give? 6-7-8-9-10? Need 7,8,9. Not. So 9 is not a straight. Actually our gutshot is 9 for straight? Let's check: we have Q, we need J? The board has T and K, missing J and Q? We have Q, so need J? Actually we could have J for straight J-10-Q-K? That's not straight. Straight requires 5 consecutive. With board T, K, we need 9-J-Q? That's not consecutive. Let's think: Our hand Qc4c. The board: 6, T, K. To make a straight, we need 9-J? Not possible. The only straight possible with K and T is 9-10-J-Q-K (needs 9 and J). So we need both 9 and J, not just 9. So we have a gutshot? Actually we need a 9 and a J; we have Q, so we need both 9 and J. That's a double gutshot? Not exactly. So we have no immediate draw. The only outs are clubs for flush (9 outs). Also maybe a straight draw with 9 and J? That's two cards, not immediate.\n\nThus outs: 9 clubs. Also maybe a pair of Q (queen) to make top pair? We have Qc, board no Q. So if Q appears, we have top pair. That's 3 queens left. Also if 4 pairs? 4c already used"

          "reasoning_content": "We have 6c9s on button, 10.6 BB short stack. Blinds: SB 16, BB 32, we are BTN with 338 chips. Pot 48. To call is 16 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., raise 48 more). With 10 BB stack, we could go all-in (338). Hand is weak, suited but low. In short stack situation, need to pick spots to steal blinds. 6-9 offsuit? Actually 6c9s suited. On button, can attempt steal. But opponent in BB has 556 chips, decent stack. Our hand is not strong enough to risk all-in vs BB who may call. However, with 10 BB, we might consider a shove if we think BB folds often to button raises. But typical raise size is 2.5-3 BB (80-96). Minimum raise is 64, which is 2 BB? Actually 64 total includes call 32? Wait we have to raise to total amount 64, meaning raise by 32 (since call 32). That's 2 BB raise. That's a small raise. Might be okay.\n\nGiven short stack, we want to preserve chips unless good chance. 6-9 suited is marginal. Could fold. But button can attempt steal. I think we should raise to 64 (minimum raise) to try steal, not all-in. Reason: hand is weak, but position and short stack may justify a steal attempt. If BB calls, we are likely behind. But we can fold later. So raise.\n\nThus JSON: action raise, raise_to 64, reasoning.\n\n",

Actually SB 16, BB 32, we raised 64 (so total 64?), then opponent called 32. So pot after preflop = 64+32+16+32? Wait SB posted 16, BB posted 32, then raise to 64 (meaning we put 64 total). So total preflop contributions: SB 16, BB 32, our raise 64, opponent call 32. So pot = 16+32+64+32 = 144? But they say pot 128 on flop. Might be they count only after flop? Anyway.\n\nFlop: Qd 7h 7s. Opponent (seat1) checked. We have 6c9s, which is a gutshot straight draw? Actually board: Q-7-7. Our hand: 6 and 9. We have open-ended? The board pairs 7s, we have 6 and 9: possible straight draws: 8 would give 7-8-9-10-J? Not. Let's see combos: With 6 and 9, we have a gutshot to a straight: need 8 for 6-7-8-9-10? Actually board has Q,7,7. To make straight with our cards we need 8 and 10? Wait need 5-card sequence. Our cards: 6 and 9. Combine with board: 7,7,Q. The best possible straight using our hole cards would be 6-7-8-9-10, but we lack 8 and 10, and board doesn't have 8 or 10. So we need both 8 and 10 on turn and river, not a good draw.\n\nWe have pair? No. We have no pair, no overcards (Q is higher than 9,6). So we have basically a weak hand, just backdoor possibilities (maybe a flush? Suits: 6c,9s, board: Qd 7h 7s. We have a spade 9 and board has a spade 7, so we have a backdoor flush draw (needs two more spades). Not strong.\n\nOpponent checked. Likely they have a weak hand or a medium hand (maybe a queen, a 7, or a set? They could have a set of 7s (but they would likely bet). Could have Qx, they'd probably bet. Could have overpair? Not possible (board Q). Could have a draw like KJ for gutshot? Not likely.\n\nGiven our weak hand, we should check (or possibly bet as a bluff). Our stack is short (9 BB). Opponent has 524 chips (big stack). We could try a bluff raise? Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise to 32 total?). Actually raise to 32 means total bet of 32? Since amount to call is 0, minimum raise is 32 (i.e., bet 32). That would be a small bet ~1/4 pot (pot 128). Could be a continuation bet (c-bet) as we raised preflop. Many players c-bet on flop with overpairs, but here board is paired and Q high; we have no equity. A small bet may be called by many, losing chips. Better to check and see turn.\n\nThus action: check. Reasoning: weak hand, no equity, opponent checked, likely they have something, we want to preserve stack.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Wait actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 16, Seat1 post_bb 32. So we are SB? Actually seat5 is BTN but they posted SB? Might be mislabel: In this hand, seat5 posted SB 16, seat1 posted BB 32. So we are SB with 6h Ts. So we are out of position relative to BB? Actually SB is first to act preflop after blinds, then BB acts. So we act first, facing only blind amounts.\n\nWe have amount to call 16 (to match BB? Actually BB is 32, we posted 16, so to call we need to put additional 16 to match BB). Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., raise total to 64, which is 48 more). Legal actions fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Hand 6T unsuited, medium strength. In short stack 14.6 BB, SB position, facing a BB who may be tight? Need opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking is BB. Look at recall: many raises with varied sizes, sometimes big (200, 276) indicating possibly aggressive. Could be willing to raise big. But also many small raises (6,7,12). So unpredictable. In SB with 6T, typical strategy: if you have 14 BB, you could consider stealing blind by raising, but 6T is not premium. Might be okay to call and see flop? But out of position, risk of playing deep post-flop with weak hand. Could also fold and preserve stack.\n\nStack 466, blinds 48 total. If we call 16, we will have 450 left, still 14 BB. If we raise to 64, we risk 48 more. Is 6T good for steal? Not ideal. Might be better to fold and wait for better.\n\nGiven opponent may raise big, but currently they haven't acted yet; they are BB, will act after us. If we raise, they can call or re-raise. With 6T, not great.\n\nThus likely fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

          "content": "We have hand #100, flop: board 6s Ad Td. We have Ac 2c, giving top pair Aces with a weak kicker (2). Also a nut flush draw? Actually we have clubs: Ace of clubs, 2 of clubs. Board clubs: none. So no flush draw. Straight draws? Board: A,T,6. Our hand: A,2. We have pair of Aces, but also potential for a full house? Not yet. Opponent (Seat1) raised flop to 180 after we bet 48. So pot before opponent raise: preflop pot 388? Wait pot after preflop: blinds 16+32 + raise 80 + call 48 = 176? Actually compute: SB 16, BB 32, raise 80 (to 96 total?), Let's compute: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. Then SB raises to 80 (meaning adds 64 more). So total SB = 80, BB = 32, then BB calls 48 (to match 80). So pot after preflop: 80+80? Wait SB 80, BB 80 (since BB called 48 extra). So pot = 160. But given pot is 388 at flop, maybe there are antes or something. But we accept given pot 388.\n\nWe bet 48 on flop (likely half pot). Opponent raised to 180, so raise total 180, amount to call 132 (since we already put 48). Minimum raise to 312 (i.e., raise at least to 312). Our stack 338, we can raise to 312 (which is 312 total, meaning additional 264? Actually we have already 48 in pot; to raise to 312 we need to put total 312, meaning additional 264). That's possible (stack 338). So legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have top pair Aces, but opponent's raise could indicate stronger hand: maybe a set (6s?), but board has 6s, we have no 6. Opponent could have pocket tens (TT) for trips, or pocket As (AA) for set (but we have Ace of clubs, they could have Ace of hearts/diamonds/spades). Could be a straight (9-8). But board A T 6, a straight would be 8-9? Actually need 8-9 to make 6-7-8-9-T? No board lacks 7,8,9. Straight combos: 9-8 would give 8-9-10-J-Q? Not. So only possible straight combos: 9-8? Not. So likely opponent has a set (TT or 66) or two pair (AT). Could also have a flush draw? No clubs. Could have Ace with good kicker (AJ, AQ). But raise size is large: 180 to 48 call, so they are raising ~3.75x the bet. This is a sizable raise, maybe they have a strong hand or a bluff.\n\nOur stack is shallow (10.6 BB). Pot after opponent raise: pot = 388 + 48 (our bet) + 180 (their raise) = 616? Actually pot before flop bet was 388. We bet 48, making pot 436. Opponent raises to 180, adding 132 extra (since they already matched 48). So new pot = 436 + 132 = 568? Wait need to compute: Starting pot 388. We bet 48, pot becomes 436. Opponent raises to 180, meaning they put total 180, which is 132 more than our 48, so pot becomes 436 + 132 = 568. Yes pot 568.\n\nWe have 338 stack, we have already 48 in pot, so remaining stack 338-48 = 290. To call 132 we need to put 132, leaving 158. To raise to 312 (total), we need to put 312-48 = 264, leaving 26 chips left (so near all-in). Actually raising to 312 would be a big raise, near all-in. Could also go all-in 338, but min raise is 312, we could raise to 338 (all-in). But raise to 312 is allowed.\n\nDecision: With top pair Aces, but opponent could have a set. Our kicker is weak. With short stack, we might consider calling if we think we are ahead, but risk of being dominated. However, we have Ace of clubs, which is the nut flush draw? No clubs on board, so not. Our equity vs set is low.\n\nWe could also consider raising all-in to put pressure, but opponent likely ahead, raising could get called and we lose more. Better to call and see turn? Turn unknown.

Opponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 216 chips, SB originally 16, now after preflop they raised to 80, we called 48 (so we have 32+48=80 contributed). Flop: board 6s Ad Td. We bet 48 (half pot?), pot before flop: 80+16? Let's calculate: Preflop: SB 16, BB 32, raise to 80 (SB raise 64 more), we call 48 (so we put 48 more). So total preflop contributions: SB 80, BB 80 (32+48). Pot 160. Flop: we bet 48, opponent raised to 180, we called 132. So after flop, pot: preflop 160 + our 48 + opponent 180 + our 132 = 520. That matches given pot 520 at turn. Turn card unknown? Actually board includes turn? Turn is after this stage: board currently shows 6s Ad Td 4c. So turn is 4c (clubs). That gave us a flush draw? We have Ac 2c, board has 4c, so we have two clubs in hand, one club on board, need two more clubs for flush. Not there yet.\n\nOur hand: top pair Aces with a weak kicker, plus a backdoor flush draw (clubs). Also possible straight draws? Board: A T 6 4. No straight possibilities.\n\nOpponent's actions: On flop we bet 48, they raised to 180 (big raise). That suggests they have strong hand or a draw. Could be two pair, set, strong Ace with good kicker, or maybe a draw like flush draw (they have clubs). They could also be bluff. We called.\n\nNow turn: 4c adds a club, giving us a flush draw (two clubs in hand + one on board). Opponent could have clubs as well. Our top pair Aces but weak kicker; opponent could have A with better kicker (like AK, AQ, AJ, AT), could have set of 6s or Ts? No, board has 6s and Td; set of 6 would be 6x, but we would have seen flop raise maybe. Could be a set of 6s (6c? Actually 6s on board, there are two other 6s in deck; they could have 6c 6h etc). Set of 6s would be strong, they'd likely continue. Could be two pair (AdTd) with a good kicker. Could be a straight draw? Not possible.\n\nOur stack: 206 chips total, we have 206 left, we have already contributed 80+48+132 = 260? Wait that exceeds stack. Actually our stack is 206 chips total at start of hand? It says stack 206 chips (6.4 BB). That's after posting BB? Yes our stack after posting BB is 206. Then we called 48 preflop, leaving 158. Then we bet 48 on flop, leaving 110. Then we called 132 on flop raise (but we only have 110 left!). Something off: Actually our stack is 206 chips at start of hand (including BB). We posted 32, leaving 174. Then we called raise 48 (meaning we put extra 48 after the raise? Actually preflop: SB raise 80 (to 80 total). BB call 48 (so we put 48 more, total 80). So after call, our remaining stack: 206-32-48 = 126? Wait we posted 32, then added 48 = total 80, leaving 126. Flop: we bet 48, leaving 78. Opponent raised to 180, we call 132, but we only have 78 left. So actually we must be all-in. But the given data says amount to call 0, min raise 132, legal actions: fold, check, raise. So maybe the stack numbers are after contributions? Possibly the stack shown is remaining after contributions? It says your stack: 206 chips (6.4 BB). That is current stack before turn action. So after flop call, we have 206 left. That implies the pot contributions were from opponent's stack? Hmm.\n\nLet's accept given: we have 206 chips remaining, pot 520, min raise 132, we can raise up to maybe all-in.\n\nWe need to decide action. Evaluate equity: Our hand A\u26632\u2663 vs opponent unknown. Opponent likely has strong hand, maybe A with good kicker, or set, or two pair,"

          "reasoning_content": "We need decide action on turn. Situation: BB with A\u26632\u2663. Board: 6s A\u2666 T\u2666 4c. So we have top pair (Aces) with weak kicker (2). Opponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 216 chips, SB originally 16, now after preflop they raised to 80, we called 48 (so we have 32+48=80 contributed). Flop: board 6s Ad Td. We bet 48 (half pot?), pot before flop: 80+16? Let's calculate: Preflop: SB 16, BB 32, raise to 80 (SB raise 64 more), we call 48 (so we put 48 more). So total preflop contributions: SB 80, BB 80 (32+48). Pot 160. Flop: we bet 48, opponent raised to 180, we called 132. So after flop, pot: preflop 160 + our 48 + opponent 180 + our 132 = 520. That matches given pot 520 at turn. Turn card unknown? Actually board includes turn? Turn is after this stage: board currently shows 6s Ad Td 4c. So turn is 4c (clubs). That gave us a flush draw? We have Ac 2c, board has 4c, so we have two clubs in hand, one club on board, need two more clubs for flush. Not there yet.\n\nOur hand: top pair Aces with a weak kicker, plus a backdoor flush draw (clubs). Also possible straight draws? Board: A T 6 4. No straight possibilities.\n\nOpponent's actions: On flop we bet 48, they raised to 180 (big raise). That suggests they have strong hand or a draw. Could be two pair, set, strong Ace with good kicker, or maybe a draw like flush draw (they have clubs). They could also be bluff. We called.\n\nNow turn: 4c adds a club, giving us a flush draw (two clubs in hand + one on board). Opponent could have clubs as well. Our top pair Aces but weak kicker; opponent could have A with better kicker (like AK, AQ, AJ, AT), could have set of 6s or Ts? No, board has 6s and Td; set of 6 would be 6x, but we would have seen flop raise maybe. Could be a set of 6s (6c? Actually 6s on board, there are two other 6s in deck; they could have 6c 6h etc). Set of 6s would be strong, they'd likely continue. Could be two pair (AdTd) with a good kicker. Could be a straight draw? Not possible.\n\nOur stack: 206 chips total, we have 206 left, we have already contributed 80+48+132 = 260? Wait that exceeds stack. Actually our stack is 206 chips total at start of hand? It says stack 206 chips (6.4 BB). That's after posting BB? Yes our stack after posting BB is 206. Then we called 48 preflop, leaving 158. Then we bet 48 on flop, leaving 110. Then we called 132 on flop raise (but we only have 110 left!). Something off: Actually our stack is 206 chips at start of hand (including BB). We posted 32, leaving 174. Then we called raise 48 (meaning we put extra 48 after the raise? Actually preflop: SB raise 80 (to 80 total). BB call 48 (so we put 48 more, total 80). So after call, our remaining stack: 206-32-48 = 126? Wait we posted 32, then added 48 = total 80, leaving 126. Flop: we bet 48, leaving 78. Opponent raised to 180, we call 132, but we only have 78 left. So actually we must be all-in. But the given data says amount to call 0, min raise 132, legal actions: fold, check, raise. So maybe the stack numbers are after contributions? Possibly the stack shown is remaining after contributions? It says your stack: 206 chips (6.4 BB). That is current stack before turn action. So after flop call, we have 206 left. That implies the pot contributions were from opponent's stack? Hmm.\n\nLet's accept given: we have 206 chips remaining, pot 520, min raise 132, we can raise up to maybe all-in.\n\nWe need to decide action. Evaluate equity: Our hand A\u26632\u2663 vs opponent unknown. Opponent likely has strong hand, maybe A with good kicker, or set, or two pair,",

Also have a flush draw? Suits: board has diamonds: Ad Td, we have Ac (clubs) 2c, so not flush. Straight draw? Board: 6, A, T, 4. No. So only pair of Aces, weak kicker. Opponent (seat 1) bet 216 into pot 736. Pot before bet? Let's compute: preflop pot: blinds 48 + call 48 = 96? Actually preflop: SB 16, BB 32, raise 80 (total 96?), then call 48 (so raise to 80? Wait details: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. SB raise 80 (so total 96?), BB call 48 (makes total 144?). Let's compute: SB posted 16, then raise to 80 means adds 64 more? Actually raise 80 likely means total bet 80. So SB bet 80, BB call 48 (to match 80). So pot after preflop: SB 80 + BB 80 = 160? plus blinds? Already accounted. So pot 160.\n\nFlop: board 6s Ad Td. BB bet 48, then seat1 raise 180, then BB call 132. So flop betting: BB bet 48, seat1 raise to 180 (so additional 132), BB call 132. So pot after flop: starting 160 + 48+180+132 = 520? Let's compute: after preflop pot 160. Flop: BB bet 48 -> pot 208. Seat1 raise to 180 (adds 180) -> pot 388. BB call 132 -> pot 520. Good.\n\nTurn: board 4c. BB check, seat1 bets 216. So pot before turn bet: 520. Seat1 bet 216, making pot 736 (as given). So we face 216 to call.\n\nOur hand: top pair Aces, but weak kicker. Opponent's range: they raised preflop from SB (seat1). Preflop raise size 80 (3x BB). That indicates a fairly wide range, maybe any Ace, broadway, pairs, suited connectors. On flop, they raised after our bet, showing strength. They could have a strong Ace, a set, two pair, maybe a straight draw? Board is A T 6. They could have A? They could have a hand like AK, AQ, AJ, AT (two pair), or a set of 6s (but board has 6s, not 6c). Set of 6s would be 6x, they'd have 6s? Actually board 6s, so set would be 6s? Need two 6s in hand, improbable. Could be a set of T? board has Td, so set of Ts would be TT, they'd have TT. Could be a set of A? board has Ad, so set of As would be AA, they'd have Ace. So they could have AA (but we have Ac, so they can't have AA). They could have a straight draw like 9-8? Not on board.\n\nTurn 4c adds a club, giving us a flush draw? No, we have clubs A\u26632\u2663, board clubs only 4c, so we have two clubs, need two more clubs on board for flush, not there.\n\nOur hand is likely second best vs many combos. Opponent betting 216 on turn could be continuation bet with a wide range, maybe trying to fold us. But we have top pair; we could call. However our stack is 206 chips total, we have 206 left? Actually stack before action is 206, but we already have some in pot? Our effective stack after call would be 206 - 216? Wait we have 206 chips total, we have already contributed some to pot: preflop call 48, flop call 132, turn check 0. So remaining stack = 206 - (48+132) = 26 chips. Actually we started with 206 chips total. We posted BB 32 (but that is part of stack). Let's compute: Starting stack 206. Posted BB 32 (so 174 left). Call preflop 48 (to match raise) means we put additional 48? Actually we called 48 after raise to 80, so we put 48 more, leaving 126. Flop bet 48 (we bet) leaving 78. Call 132 (we called opponent's raise) leaving -? Wait we called 132 after opponent raised to"

Wait details: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. SB raise 80 (so total 96?), BB call 48 (makes total 144?). Let's compute: SB posted 16, then raise to 80 means adds 64 more? Actually raise 80 likely means total bet 80. So SB bet 80, BB call 48 (to match 80). So pot after preflop: SB 80 + BB 80 = 160? plus blinds? Already accounted. So pot 160.\n\nFlop: board 6s Ad Td. BB bet 48, then seat1 raise 180, then BB call 132. So flop betting: BB bet 48, seat1 raise to 180 (so additional 132), BB call 132. So pot after flop: starting 160 + 48+180+132 = 520? Let's compute: after preflop pot 160. Flop: BB bet 48 -> pot 208. Seat1 raise to 180 (adds 180) -> pot 388. BB call 132 -> pot 520. Good.\n\nTurn: board 4c. BB check, seat1 bets 216. So pot before turn bet: 520. Seat1 bet 216, making pot 736 (as given). So we face 216 to call.\n\nOur hand: top pair Aces, but weak kicker. Opponent's range: they raised preflop from SB (seat1). Preflop raise size 80 (3x BB). That indicates a fairly wide range, maybe any Ace, broadway, pairs, suited connectors. On flop, they raised after our bet, showing strength. They could have a strong Ace, a set, two pair, maybe a straight draw? Board is A T 6. They could have A? They could have a hand like AK, AQ, AJ, AT (two pair), or a set of 6s (but board has 6s, not 6c). Set of 6s would be 6x, they'd have 6s? Actually board 6s, so set would be 6s? Need two 6s in hand, improbable. Could be a set of T? board has Td, so set of Ts would be TT, they'd have TT. Could be a set of A? board has Ad, so set of As would be AA, they'd have Ace. So they could have AA (but we have Ac, so they can't have AA). They could have a straight draw like 9-8? Not on board.\n\nTurn 4c adds a club, giving us a flush draw? No, we have clubs A\u26632\u2663, board clubs only 4c, so we have two clubs, need two more clubs on board for flush, not there.\n\nOur hand is likely second best vs many combos. Opponent betting 216 on turn could be continuation bet with a wide range, maybe trying to fold us. But we have top pair; we could call. However our stack is 206 chips total, we have 206 left? Actually stack before action is 206, but we already have some in pot? Our effective stack after call would be 206 - 216? Wait we have 206 chips total, we have already contributed some to pot: preflop call 48, flop call 132, turn check 0. So remaining stack = 206 - (48+132) = 26 chips. Actually we started with 206 chips total. We posted BB 32 (but that is part of stack). Let's compute: Starting stack 206. Posted BB 32 (so 174 left). Call preflop 48 (to match raise) means we put additional 48? Actually we called 48 after raise to 80, so we put 48 more, leaving 126. Flop bet 48 (we bet) leaving 78. Call 132 (we called opponent's raise) leaving -? Wait we called 132 after opponent raised to",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to compute stack correctly. Let's recalc:\n\nInitial stack: 206.\n\nBlinds: SB 16, BB 32. So we posted 32, remaining 174.\n\nPreflop: SB raises to 80 (total). We call 48 (to match 80). So we put 48, remaining 126.\n\nFlop: we bet 48, remaining 78. Opponent raises to 180, we call 132 (additional). So we put 132, remaining -? 78-132 = -54, impossible. Means our stack before flop call is larger. Actually after posting BB and preflop call, we have 126. Flop bet 48: we bet 48, leaving 78. Opponent raises to 180, we need to call additional 132 (since we already have 48 in). But we only have 78 left, cannot call 132. So maybe the numbers are relative to pot, not our stack? The pot numbers given may be in chips, but our stack 206 seems low relative to betting amounts (216). Actually we have 206 chips total, but bet 48 on flop, raise 132 call? That exceeds our stack. Something off: maybe the stack is after posting blinds? Let's consider: Starting stack 206 includes blinds? Usually stack includes all chips you have before posting blinds. So after posting BB 32, you have 174. Then you call 48, you have 126. Then you bet 48, you have 78. Then you call 132, you would go all-in with 78, but they say call 132, meaning you had enough. So maybe the stack is larger than 206; perhaps the stack shown is after posting blinds? Actually they list \"Your Stack: 206 chips (6.4 BB)\". Blinds are 16/32, so 32 BB = 1 BB? 206 chips is 6.4 BB, so BB is 32, 6.4*32 = 204.8 approx. So stack is 206 chips total. Yet betting amounts exceed that. Something inconsistent. However we must act based on given legal actions: we can only fold or call. So we cannot raise. So we must decide fold or call.\n\nGiven our stack is low, calling 216 would be all-in (since we only have 206?). Actually amount to call 216 > stack, so calling means we go all-in for remaining chips. In many poker implementations, you can call all-in for less than amount. So we can call with our remaining 206? But they say amount to call 216, maybe we have 206 left, cannot call full, but can go all-in for 206, which is a call of less than required, considered call all-in.\n\nGiven we have top pair but weak kicker, short stack, tournament pressure, we might call to try to double up. Opponent may have stronger Ace (like AK) or two pair. Our chances are low. But we are short stack, need chips. Fold would preserve 206? Actually we have 206 left, folding would keep 206 (since we haven't contributed turn). Wait we already have 206 total, but have contributed earlier bets. Our current stack is maybe less than 206, but they display 206 as remaining stack before turn. So if we fold, we keep 206. If we call, we go all-in and risk losing all. With weak hand, likely fold.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

But we have amount to call 32 (to match BB?), Actually amount to call is 32 (the SB posted 32, BB posted 64, so we need to call 32 more to match BB? Wait we are SB, we already posted 32, need to call 32 more to match BB's 64). So we can call 32 to see flop. With 3-2 offsuit, not worth call. So fold.\n\nWe should output JSON.",

Actually SB posted 32, BB 64, plus maybe antes? pot 96). We are to act after SB posted 32 (small blind) and BB posted 64. Actually actions: Seat5 post_sb 32, Seat1 post_bb 64. So we are in BTN (but also SB?) Wait seat5 is BTN but also posted SB? Actually BTN is seat5 and also is small blind? Usually BTN is not SB. But here they posted SB 32, so seat5 is SB (maybe they are in SB position). The description says Position: BTN (Seat5). But they posted SB. Possibly they are both BTN and SB due to 2-player? Actually there are many folds, only seat1 BB and seat5 SB (BTN). So they are in the small blind, button is also SB because only two players left? In heads-up, SB is also button. So position is SB (also button). So we are first to act preflop after posting SB. The BB has posted 64, we face 32 to call (to match BB). Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., raise by 96? Actually raise total to 128). Our stack 174, so we can raise to 128 (leaving 46 behind). Or go all-in 174.\n\nHand 7d Qh is not great. With 2.7 BB short stack, need to shove or fold. In heads-up, 7Q offsuit is marginal. But given we are short, we could push all-in to try to steal BB. However we have 2.7 BB, which is borderline for a shove? Typically with <3 BB you push or fold, but with 7Q offsuit maybe push is okay? But we are out of position (SB vs BB). In heads-up, SB is first to act preflop, but after posting, we act first? Actually after posting SB, action goes to BB first preflop (in heads-up). In heads-up, the SB acts first preflop? Wait in heads-up, the dealer is also the small blind, and the big blind acts first preflop? Actually in heads-up, the dealer posts small blind and acts first preflop, then big blind acts second. But here they posted SB then BB, and now it's our turn? The actions list only posts, no further actions. So it's our turn to act? In heads-up, after blinds posted, the SB (dealer) acts first preflop. So we are to act now, facing BB's 64 already in pot, and we have to call 32 to see flop or raise.\n\nGiven 7Q offsuit, short stack, we could shove all-in (174) which is 2.7 BB. That's typical push/fold strategy. Is 7Q a push? According to typical push/fold charts for 2.7 BB in heads-up, you push with any Ace, any pair, broadways, maybe QJ, KQ, etc. 7Q is maybe marginal. Many charts include Q9+, J9+, T9+, 98s etc. 7Q is Q7 offsuit, not strong. Might be a fold. But also we could call 32 (just match BB) and hope to see flop. But with 2.7 BB, calling is not great because we would be out of position post-flop (BB will act first). And we have weak hand.\n\nThus likely fold. But we could consider raising to 128 (min raise) to try to steal. That's a raise, not all-in. But we have only 174 chips, raising to 128 leaves 46 behind, then BB could call or raise. Might be too much.\n\nGiven typical tournament, short stack push/fold: 7Q offsuit is probably a fold. So answer fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually position BTN seat5, but actions show seat5 post_sb 32 (small blind) and seat1 post_bb 64 (big blind). So we are small blind, not button? Wait seat5 is BTN but also posted small blind? In tournament, button posts small blind? Usually button posts small blind if only 2 players? But here seats: seat1 is Kimi-K2 (maybe dealer?), seat5 is us BTN posting small blind. So we are small blind with 7c Qh, stack 174, effective stack after posting 32 is 142 left. To call big blind 64, need to call 32 more (since already posted 32). Pot is 96 (32+64). Minimum raise to 128 means raise total to 128 (i.e., additional 96). With only 174 stack, we could raise to 128 (i.e., put in 96 more). That would be about 1.5 BB raise.\n\nWe need to decide: 7c Qh is a weak hand. In SB with short stack, but still 2.7 BB, we could consider shove all-in? All-in would be 174 total, which is 78 more than raise to 128. But typical strategy with 2.7 BB: push or fold unless you have a hand that can call a raise. Since we are first to act after BB, we can either call 32 more (making 64 total) and see flop, or raise (or shove). With Q7 offsuit, it's not a good call vs potential raise from BB. The BB could have a wide range. Better to just call the blind and hope to see flop cheap? But calling 32 adds 64 total into pot (our 64 vs BB 64). That would be 2 BB invested. Might be okay.\n\nBut with 2.7 BB, many players go all-in or fold. However, Q7 off is not great for a shove; could be dominated. Better to just call and see flop? However, if BB raises, we would be in trouble. But we can then fold.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should just call the BB (i.e., \"call\") and see flop cheap. That's typical.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

We have queen high, no pair, no straight draw (possible 9-10? Actually board: J J 8, we have Q and 7, we have gutshot? We need 10 to make straight J-10-9-8-7? Wait board J J 8, we have Q and 7. Straight possibilities: 10-9-? No, need 9-10 to make J-10-9-8-7? But we have 7, need 9 and 10 to make 7-8-9-10-J, but only one card left. So not. Flush draw? board has two diamonds, we have none. So we have basically queen high, not strong. Opponent is Kimi-K2, stack 672 chips, big stack. He checked flop. We have no reason to bet, but could consider a bluff? However we are short stack: 142 chips left after posting SB and calling? Actually after preflop we have 142 - 32 (SB) - 32 (call) = 78 chips left? Wait stack is 142 chips total at start of hand. After posting SB 32, we have 110 left. Then call 32, leaves 78. So we have 78 chips left. Pot is 128. So we are at 78 chips left, 1.0 BB? Actually 64 is BB, we have 78 chips ~1.2 BB. So we are short stack. We could consider going all-in to try to steal? But board is J J 8, opponent may have a jack, or a set, or a straight draw, or a queen? But checking suggests maybe they missed flop or have weak hand. If we shove, we risk being called by a better hand. But we are short, maybe we need to find a spot to double up. The board is paired Jacks, so many hands will have J, maybe they have a jack, a set, two pair, etc. If they have Jx, they'd likely call. If they have a queen, they'd have top pair, they'd call. If they have a 8, they'd have pair. So likely many will call. But we could try a bluff if they are tight and check. But we have very little equity, and we are out of position? Actually we are on button, we are first to act after flop check. We could check and hope to see turn cheap. Since we have only 78 chips left, we could also consider an all-in raise to 78 (or to total 78? Actually we have 78 chips left, so all-in would be 78. Minimum raise is 64, we can raise to 78 (all-in). Legal actions: raise. Should we raise all-in? Let's think: Pot 128, we have 78, so if we go all-in, pot would be 206 (if called). Opponent has 672 chips, so they can call. Pot odds for opponent: they need to call 78 to win 206, about 38% equity needed. Many hands have >38%? Actually they have Jacks, sets, two pair, etc. Even a single jack has ~33%? But they'd have some equity. So likely they'll call with many hands. Our equity with queen high vs random hand maybe 10-15%. Not good. So better to check and preserve chips for better spot. Since we have 78 chips, we could also consider folding? But we have no bet to call, we can check. So best action is check. So output JSON with action check, raise_to null.\n\n",

No straight possibilities. Flush? Two diamonds on board (Jd, Ad) plus 8d. That's three diamonds, we have no diamond. So no flush. So we have only queen high, which is weak. Opponent (Seat 1) checked turn after checking flop. Both players checked preflop after posting blinds? Actually preflop: we posted small blind 32, opponent posted big blind 64. We called 32, opponent checked (so they are in BB). Flop: both checked. Turn: opponent checked. So pot 128. We're on button with 142 chips left, about 2.2 BB, very short stack. Turn is last street before river. Our hand is weak. We could fold, but amount to call is 0, we can check. However we might consider shoving all-in? But we have 142 chips, which is more than min raise 64. Raising all-in could be a bluff. But opponent just checked, maybe they have weak hand or drawing. However board is paired Jacks and Ace high. Opponent might have J? Or A? Or 8? They could have a hand like AJ, KJ, etc. But they checked, maybe they have weak. Our stack is short, we could try to steal by raising to maybe 128? But we only have 142 total, so raise to all-in 142. Does that make sense? With queen high, unlikely to get called unless opponent is also short and wants to see river. But they could call with any Ace, any Jack, any pair, any straight draw. Likely they have something. Better to check and hope to see river for free, maybe improve? River unknown. But with such short stack, we might consider going all-in to try to double up if opponent folds. But opponent just checked multiple streets, maybe they are passive or have weak. However they are the big blind, maybe they are short-stacked too? Their stack is 672 chips, much larger. So they can call. They may have a hand like Ace high, could call. But they might fold to a shove. Hard to know.\n\nGiven we have only queen high, I think checking is safest. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. We preserve chips for later.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have BTN with A5 offsuit (Ad5h). Stack 142 chips, blinds 32/64, we are small blind? Wait position BTN seat5, but actions: seat5 post_sb 32, seat1 post_bb 64. So we are SB, not BTN? Actually seat5 is BTN but also SB? In a 5-player? Actually seat numbers: seat5 is our seat, and they posted small blind 32. So we are SB. So we are in small blind with 2.2 BB. The big blind posted 64. Pot 96 (SB+BB). We have to act after BB? Actually preflop order: after blinds, action starts with UTG etc but all others folded, so it's just us (SB) then BB. So we are first to act facing BB's 64, we have already posted 32, need to call 32 more to match BB. Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., raise additional 96). Our stack 142, so we could raise to 128 (i.e., total 128). That's a raise of 96 (so we would be putting 128 total). That leaves us with 14 chips left (since we already posted 32, raising to 128 means we need to add 96 more, total 128, leaving 14). That's a very small stack, could be all-in soon.\n\nHand A5 offsuit is weak. With 2.2 BB, we need to decide: fold, call, raise. Usually with such short stack, you might push all-in (raise to 142) or call to see flop. But A5 offsuit is not great, but Ace is strong. However, we are short-stacked; we could try to steal BB by raising all-in, but with only 2.2 BB, it's essentially a push. However, the BB is 64, they have 704 chips, deep stack, they could call. With A5 offsuit, you have about 30% equity vs random hand? Might be okay to push. But also we could just call 32 to see flop and maybe get good flop. However, calling 32 leaves us with 110 chips left after call (since we already posted 32). Actually after call we will have 110 chips left. Then we will be out of position on flop against BB. With A5 offsuit, not great.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, we have low stack, need to survive. A5 offsuit is not premium but Ace can win. I think push (raise all-in) is reasonable. Minimum raise to 128 leaves 14 chips left; could also raise to 142 (all-in). The legal raise is to 128 minimum; can we raise to 142? Yes if allowed, it's an all-in raise. Should we raise to 142? That's full stack. That would be a push.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 142.\n\nReasoning: short stack, need to pick up chips, Ace high gives decent equity, stealing BB possible.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide preflop action with 5h Th in BB, stack 174 (2.7 BB). Blinds 32/64, pot 192 (SB+BB+raise). Seat1 (Kimi) raised to 128 (i.e., raised 64 over BB). Amount to call 64 (to match 128). Minimum raise to 192 (i.e., raise additional 64). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nOur hand 5h Th is a suited Ten with a low kicker. In short stack situation (2.7 BB) we need to consider ICM and survival. 5hTh is not premium; it's a marginal hand. Against a raise from SB (seat1) who appears to raise varying amounts; from recall, they sometimes raise large (e.g., 276, 200) but also small (6, 12). Not clear. Our stack is 174, we have 64 to call, leaving 110 after call. That's about 1.7 BB left. If we call, we will be short-stacked. Could consider going all-in (raise to 174) but raise must be at least 192 (minimum raise), which exceeds our stack; we can go all-in for 174 (which is less than minimum raise, but all-in is allowed if can't meet min raise). So raise all-in is possible.\n\nBut is 5hTh strong enough to shove? At 2.7 BB, typical shoving range includes broadway combos, suited connectors, and maybe T9 suited, but 5hTh is a ten-high suited, not great but could be okay as a semi-bluff if opponent is tight. However, we are out of position (BB vs SB). SB raised, we are in BB (post-flop disadvantage). Usually with such short stack, you either fold or shove if you have enough equity. 5hTh vs unknown range: SB could be raising wide from SB (maybe 2-5% of hands). 5hTh equity vs wide range maybe ~30%? Might be okay to shove.\n\nBut also we have only 174 chips; the pot after call would be 256 (192+64). If we call, we have 110 left, still short. If we call and lose, we are out. If we shove and get called, we could double up.\n\nGiven the short stack, I'd likely shove (raise all-in). However need to check if legal: raise_to must be total amount we put in. All-in is 174 total (including BB 64 already posted). So raise_to = 174? Actually we have already posted 64 BB, plus we need to add 110 to go all-in, total 174. So raise_to = 174.\n\nBut is raise to 174 considered a raise? It's an all-in less than min raise, allowed. So action: raise, raise_to: 174.\n\nReasoning: short stack, marginal hand but decent suited ten, need to pick up chips, opponent's raise size moderate, we can shove to apply pressure.\n\nThus output JSON.",

But position says BTN seat5, but action shows seat5 post_sb 32, seat1 post_bb 64. So we are SB? But position says BTN. Might be mislabel. Anyway we are first to act after blinds? Actually SB posts, then BB posts, then it's our turn (BTN) preflop? But we already posted SB? This is confusing. Probably we are BTN and have posted SB? Actually BTN is seat5, but they posted SB 32. So maybe small blind is seat5, big blind seat1. So we are SB not BTN. Regardless, we are first to act after blinds? In heads-up, SB acts first preflop. So we have to decide action facing a BB of 64, amount to call is 32 (to match BB). Minimum raise is 128 (total). Our stack 238, can raise up to all-in 238.\n\nHand AhTd is decent Ace-high, but short stack 3.7 BB. In tournament short stack, we should look for shove or fold. With 3.7 BB, typical push/fold range includes any Ace, broadway, etc. AhTd is a decent Ace, but is it strong enough to push? With 3.7 BB, you can either call the BB (32) and hope to see flop, but likely you want to either shove or fold. Since we have 238 chips, min raise 128, all-in would be 238. If we call 32, we still have 206 left, but will be in a big blind with only 2 BB left after call? Actually after call, we will have 206 chips, still short. Might be better to push all-in to maximize fold equity. Many short stack strategies: with 3.7 BB, push with any Ace, especially suited? This is unsuited. Still okay.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: only opponent is seat1 with 608 chips. Could be a big stack. Might defend BB with a range. Our push could be called by strong hands. But we want to accumulate chips.\n\nGiven short stack, push all-in (raise to 238). Reasoning: need to either double up or fold; AhTd is decent for push.\n\nLegal actions include raise, so we can raise to 238.\n\nThus output.",

In BB we have a small pocket pair; we can consider calling (i.e., just match 64) to see flop cheap. But we are deep short; calling 64 leaves 206 chips left, about 3.2 BB. Could be okay. But we need to consider pot odds: call 64 to win 192+64=256? Actually pot before call is 192, we call 64, pot becomes 256. So pot odds = 64/256 = 0.25. Need >25% equity. Pocket deuces vs unknown range? Likely opponent's raise range includes many higher cards; pocket deuces maybe ~5% equity preflop vs typical raise range (maybe 30% of hands). So not enough. So folding is likely best.\n\nBut we could also consider a shove to get fold equity, but with such short stack, raising to 192 (not all-in) may be less effective; opponent could call or re-raise. Better to go all-in? All-in 270 vs opponent's 128 raise; they'd need to call 270? Actually they'd need to call 270-128 = 142 more. That's a big call; they might fold many hands. But with only 4.2 BB, a shove might be okay. However we have low pair; we want to maximize equity by seeing flop cheap, but we have low stack. I think best is to fold.\n\nCheck legal actions: fold, call, raise. We'll choose fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Actually call is 32 more, leaving us 206 after call). Raise would be aggressive but not advisable.\n\nConsider tournament: short stack 3.7 BB, need to find a spot to double up. But T2 is terrible. Could consider shove all-in (raise to 238) but that's not a legal raise? Minimum raise is 128; we could raise to all-in 238. But is that wise? Probably not.\n\nWe should fold. However we already posted SB; folding means we lose 32. That's okay.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 has raised preflop small amounts (6,14) in previous hands, maybe they are aggressive? But they are BB, likely just raise? Actually they posted BB, not raise. In this hand they haven't acted yet. The only action is BB posted. So we face a bet of 64 (BB).

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop in BB with 6s Ks, stack 270, blinds 32/64, pot 128 (SB 32, BB 64, SB called 32). We are in BB, amount to call is 0 (since SB called the BB). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We have 4.2 BB effective stack (270 chips). Hand is K6 offsuit (6s Ks). Not a great hand, but can be playable in short stack scenario. We have 4.2 BB, need to consider ICM? Tournament but early? We have 270 chips vs leader 544, others are out. So we are short-stacked, need to find spots to double up. K6 offsuit is weak; maybe we can attempt a steal? But we are in BB; SB just called, indicating they may be defending the SB with a wide range. Our hand is not strong enough to raise; maybe we can check and see flop, but we have 4.2 BB, could also consider a raise (to 128 min) to try to steal, but risk being called by stronger hand. K6 suited? It's spades, so suited, adds some flush potential. With 4.2 BB, a raise to 128 is a 2x raise (to 128 total) which is about 2 BB (since BB is 64). That's a standard raise. Could we shove? Minimum raise is 128, but we could go all-in for 270 (which is > min raise). However, we have 270, min raise is 128, but raising to 270 is allowed if we have enough chips; it's an all-in. Is that advisable? K6 suited is not a good all-in hand with 4.2 BB. Better to fold or check. Checking gives us a chance to see flop for cheap, but we are out of position post-flop (SB is in front). With 4.2 BB, we may want to pick up chips. However, K6 suited is not a top hand; we could consider folding. But maybe we can try a steal: The SB just called the BB, they might have a weak hand. If we raise, we could isolate and maybe win a small pot. But risk of being called by a stronger hand like AQ, AJ, etc. In short stack, we need to be aggressive but also not waste chips.\n\nGiven we have 270 chips, pot is 128. If we raise to 128 (total), we invest 64 more (since we already have 64 in pot). Actually we have posted BB 64, pot 128 includes SB's 32 and our 64. If we raise to 128, we add 64 more chips, making total pot 192 if called. If called, we will have 64 more in pot, pot ~192, we would be out 128 total. If we lose, we lose 64 more (down to 206). Not huge.\n\nBut we could also go all-in for 270, but that would be a huge overbet. Might be too much.\n\nI think best is to check (fold is not needed because amount to call is 0). Check and see flop. If we get a good flop, we can act.\n\nThus action: check. Reason: weak hand, short stack, not worth raising, better to see flop cheaply.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Opponent (Seat1) has 544 chips, bigger stack.\n\nWe have no pair, no draw: board shows pair of 9s, J, 7. Our hand: King high, 6 kicker. No straight draw? Board: 9-9-J-7. Possible straight draws: 8-10 would give straight, we have 6 and K, not relevant. No flush draws (board suits: d,c,d,h: two diamonds, one club, one heart). We have 6s, Ks (spade). No spade on board, so no flush.\n\nThus we have basically nothing, just king high. Opponent likely has something. They checked on flop and now on turn? Actually we are on turn after flop check. The turn card is 7h, board now 9d 9c Jd 7h. The opponent hasn't acted yet on turn (they will act after us? Actually action order: preflop: seat1 SB, seat5 BB. Flop: seat5 first (BB) then seat1 (SB). Both checked. Turn: seat5 first, then seat1. So we act first on turn. Amount to call is 0, we can check or raise. Minimum raise 64 (to 64 total). Our stack 270, can raise.\n\nGiven we are short stacked and have no showdown value, we should fold or check? If we check, opponent may bet, and we would have to call with nothing, likely lose. Better to maybe try a steal? But we are out of position (BB) but first to act on turn. Our hand is weak; raising could be a bluff, but we have only 4.2 BB, and opponent has 544 chips, likely will call or raise. If we raise to 64 (which is a half-pot?), pot 128, raise to 64 adds 64 to pot (makes pot 192). That's a small raise, might be called. But we could go all-in 270 to try to double up. However our hand is weak, but maybe opponent could fold if they have missed the board. However board is paired 9s, J, 7. Many hands have at least a pair (9) or better. Opponent could have missed. But they have a larger stack, might call with any pair or even overcards. So an all-in is risky.\n\nGiven tournament context, we have 4.2 BB, short stack, need to find spots to double up. This is a good spot to push all-in as a steal, hoping opponent folds. But opponent is the SB, has been checking both flop and turn so far, maybe they are weak. However they could have 9x, Jx, etc. But they might be willing to fold to aggression. Since we are short, we can go all-in. Legal actions include raise, check, fold. We can raise to all-in (270). That's allowed. So best action: raise all-in.\n\nThus output JSON with raise_to 270. Reasoning: short stack, no showdown value, try to double up via bluff.\n\n",

The actions: seat5 post_sb 32, seat1 post_bb 64. So seat5 is SB (small blind) not button? But they said Position: BTN (Seat5). Might be mislabel.

In short stack, typical play is to shove all-in (or raise max). Minimum raise is 128, which is about 2 BB raise (to 128 total). With 5.7 BB, a raise to 128 is less than half stack, leaving about 238 chips left. Might be better to go all-in to maximize fold equity. However the legal action only includes raise to any amount? It says raise to total amount. Minimum raise to 128, but can raise higher up to stack? Likely yes. So we could raise to 366 (all-in). That is typical.\n\nBut consider opponent: seat1 Kimi-K2 with 480 chips, likely big stack. In SB, we could shove to put pressure. Qc Kc is good equity vs any random hand.

Wait blinds: 32/64, SB is seat5? But seat5 is BTN, but they posted sb? Possibly seat5 is small blind (maybe seat5 is SB). However actions: seat5 post_sb 32, seat1 post_bb 64. So seat5 is SB, not BTN. But problem says Position: BTN (Seat5). Inconsistent. Probably they are BTN and they posted SB as a dead blind? Actually in tournaments, BTN posts SB when they are also BTN? No. Might be mislabel. Anyway we are first to act after blinds, we are in small blind? Actually SB already posted, BB posted, now action is on seat5? No, seat5 posted sb, seat1 posted bb, now it's seat5's turn to act preflop? Actually after posting blinds, action goes first to UTG (seat2 etc) but they are all folded. So next is seat5 (the BTN) who posted SB? Actually SB acts first preflop. So seat5 is SB, not BTN. So we are in SB with 9s2d, 7.2 BB. Should we fold? Very weak, but short stack, could consider shove (all-in) to try steal? Minimum raise is 128 (to 128 total). Our stack is 462, can raise to 128, but that's a small raise. Might be better to go all-in to apply pressure? Opponent seat1 is BB with 384 chips, could call. With 9-2 offsuit, not good. Should fold.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Call would be 64 more (to match BB) making pot 192. Not good. Raise to 128 (total) is small raise, but could be a bluff. However 9-2 is terrible; short stack, maybe go all-in? But raise to 128 is not all-in. All-in would be 462. That's allowed? Minimum raise to 128, you can raise higher up to your stack. So you could raise all-in. But is that wise? With 7 BB, you could attempt steal but 9-2 is terrible, likely to be called and lose. Better fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

The amount to call is 32, okay.\n\nWe have T J offsuit (different suits). With 5.7 BB, we are short stacked but not ultra short. In tournament, with 5.7 BB we should consider going all-in or raise. T J is a decent hand, but not premium. In BTN, we have position. Opponent in BB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 480 chips, larger stack. They have been raising preflop often to 128, 192 etc. So they may be aggressive. With 5.7 BB, we could push all-in to try to steal blinds. The raise to min is 128 (total). Our stack is 366, we could raise to 128 (which is 64 more than call). Or go all-in for 366. Usually with 5.7 BB, you either push all-in or fold unless you have a strong hand. T J is marginal; but with position and short stack, pushing all-in can be okay if opponent folds enough. However opponent is aggressive and may call or re-raise. But they have 480 chips, can afford to call 366. Our hand has decent equity vs a wide range. Might be okay.\n\nWe need to consider pot odds: pot 96, call 32 to see flop, but we have only 5 BB left after call? Actually after calling 32, we would have 334 left. Not great. Better to go all-in. So decision: raise all-in (366 total). Legal actions include raise, but raise_to must be total amount. Minimum raise is 128, but we can raise to 366 (all-in). So choose raise to 366.\n\nReasoning: short stack, decent hand, position, opponent aggressive, want to apply pressure.\n\nThus output JSON.",

No, we have a pair of 4s, board shows 5-6-8, no 4. So we have a set (three of a kind) of fours. That's a strong hand. Opponent (Kimi-K2) is in BB, bet 80 into pot 208 (so pot after bet: 208 + 80 = 288). Our stack 430, we have 350 left after call? Actually we have 430 total, we posted 32 preflop, so remaining 398? Wait stack includes posted blinds? Usually stack shown includes chips after posting? Usually stack shown is current chips before posting? Here they posted 32 SB, but we are BTN, posted SB? Actually we are BTN, but they said \"preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 32\". So they posted small blind. So they are SB, not BTN? But position says BTN seat 5. Might be confusion: they are BTN but posted SB? In some games, BTN posts SB? Actually in 6-max, BTN posts SB? Usually SB is seat left of dealer, but they said position BTN seat5, but they posted SB 32. That suggests they are actually SB (maybe they are seat5, but the dealer is seat4). Anyway, they have posted 32, so their stack after posting is 398. But stack shown 430 maybe pre-blind. Anyway we have about 430 chips total. After call 80, we will have about 350 left. Minimum raise to 160 (i.e., raise total 160). So raise amount would be +80 more than call.\n\nWe have a set, strong hand. Opponent bet 80, likely continuation bet. We can raise for value. But stack is short: 6.7 BB. Opponent likely also short. We should consider opponent's tendencies: recall shows they bet on flop with small amounts (4 and 15) previously. Those were likely small bets maybe with weak hands. Could be they are aggressive? Not many data. But we have a set, we want to extract value but also protect against draws (there is a flush draw: two spades on board, we have no spade, so opponent could have a flush draw). Also straight draws: board 5-6-8, we have 4, so a 7 would give straight. Opponent could have 7x. So we want to raise to charge draws. Minimum raise to 160 is decent. We could also go all-in (430) but that may be too much given opponent's stack unknown but likely similar. Opponent's stack: 304 chips. So we could raise to 304 (all-in). That would be a good move to extract max. But minimum raise is 160, we can raise to any amount up to opponent's stack? Usually raise can be any amount >= min raise. So we could raise all-in 304. That would be good to protect and get value. However, is there risk of being called by a bigger hand? Our set is likely best. So go all-in.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. So we can raise to 304 (all-in). Provide reasoning.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: we are BTN with pocket 44 on board 5c6s8sT. Board is rainbow? Actually 5c,6s,8s,Ts: two spades (6s,8s) and clubs, clubs. Our hand 44 is a pocket pair, currently middle pair (fourth pair). No straight draw? Board: 5-6-8-10. Straight possibilities: 7 gives 6-7-8-9-10? Actually need 9 as well. No. 4 gives 4-5-6-? need 7? Not. So our 44 is just a pair, likely weak. Pot 736. Stack 126 (2 BB). We are very short-stacked. Opponent (Seat1) checked to us on turn. We have 0 to call. Options: check (which would be a check-raise maybe later) or fold (but can't fold when no bet). Actually legal actions: fold, check. But folding would forfeit hand. Since we have 0 to call, checking is the only viable. But we could also consider going all-in? No, raise not legal (minimum raise 224 > our stack). So only check.\n\nWe need reasoning: Very short stack, weak hand, no equity, can't raise, checking may get us to river maybe get showdown if opponent checks again. But opponent may bet river; we have poor showdown value. So maybe we should check and hope to see river cheap? But we have no chips left to call any bet >0; we are at 126 chips total, but we already posted 32+32? Actually we posted 32 sb, called 32 preflop, plus raised 304 on flop (but that was from our stack). Wait stack after flop: Starting 126, posted sb 32, call 32 (so 62 left?), Actually posting sb is 32, then call 32 = 64 total, leaving 62. Then we raised 304 on flop, but we only have 62 left, so we must have gone all-in? But the raise amount is 304, which exceeds stack. Something inconsistent: maybe our stack was 126 after posting sb? Actually typical tournament: you post sb 32, you have 126 chips total (including sb). So after posting sb, remaining 94. Then call 32 (so total 64) leaving 62. Then raise 304? Can't. So maybe the raise is not from us? Wait actions: flop: Seat1 bet 80, Seat5 raise 304, Seat1 call 224. So we raised to 304 total (i.e., we added 304-80=224). That would be a raise of 224 from us, but we only have 62 left. Something off. Possibly the stack numbers are after posting sb? Actually the \"Your Stack: 126 chips (2.0 BB)\" maybe is after posting sb? But then you posted sb 32, leaving 94. Then you call 32, leaving 62. Then raise 304? impossible. So maybe the numbers are not consistent; maybe the raise is a bet of 304 total, but we are all-in? But then we would be all-in for 62, not 304. So maybe the stack is larger earlier but after flop we have more chips due to some other? Or perhaps the raise is from opponent? But actions say seat5 raise 304. Could be that the stack shown is after the raise? Actually after raise we would be at 0 chips (all-in). But stack shown still 126. Something contradictory.\n\nGiven the tool, we must follow legal actions: only fold or check. So we must check. Reasoning: short stack, weak hand, cannot raise, check to see river.\n\nThus output JSON.",

Wait position BTN seat 5, we are BTN but also posted SB? The actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 32, Seat1 post_bb 64. So we are SB, not BTN? Actually position says BTN (Seat5) but we posted SB because BTN is also SB? In 2-player? Actually only two players left: seat1 (BB) and seat5 (SB). So we are SB with 126 chips, posted 32, left 94. Big blind 64 posted, left 62. Pot currently 96 (32+64). Amount to call is 32 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 128 total (i.e., raise 96 more). But we have only 94 chips left after posting SB, so we cannot raise to 128 (needs 96). So we can either go all-in (call 32 then all-in 94 total) or just call (call 32) or fold. Hand is 6s8s, suited connectors, low. With effective stack 2 BB, it's a marginal hand. Consider tournament: short stack 2 BB, need to double up. Raising all-in could be good if we think opponent may fold? But they are BB, they already have 64 invested. If we go all-in, total pot would be 96 + our remaining 94 = 190? Actually we have 94 left after posting SB, call 32 uses 32, leaving 62, then can go all-in additional 62 for total 94? Wait we have total 126, posted 32, remaining 94. To call 32 we put 32 more, leaving 62. To go all-in we would put remaining 62, making total contribution 94. So final pot would be 96 + 94 = 190. Raise to 128 is not possible, so all-in is a raise.\n\nConsider opponent: BB with 720 chips, deep stack relative. Likely they will defend with a wide range vs SB. Our hand 6-8 suited is not strong enough for a shove? With 2 BB effective, typical push/fold range from SB includes many hands like any pair, suited connectors, etc. 6-8 suited is decent. Might be okay to shove.\n\nBut we must consider that we are short stack and need to double up. Our hand has some equity vs typical BB defending range (maybe 30%). Could be okay.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Raise would be all-in (since cannot meet min raise). So we can raise.\n\nThus decision: raise (all-in). Provide reasoning.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 9c5c. Flop 2s5hJd. We have a pair of fives, bottom pair, plus a backdoor flush draw (clubs). Stack is 158, pot 128. Opponent (Seat1) is SB, just called preflop, so they have 32 in pot. They are the only opponent left. They have position (SB) acting first post-flop (since BB is last). Actually after flop, action starts with SB (seat1). We have amount to call 0? Wait, \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning it's our turn? Actually actions listed: preflop: seat1 post sb 32, seat5 post bb 64, seat1 call 32, seat5 check. So after flop, SB acted? Not listed. Probably SB hasn't acted yet. But amount to call is 0, meaning it's our turn and we can check. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe have a weak hand, bottom pair, but we have some showdown value. Opponent likely will continuation bet? Not yet. Since we have 158 stack, pot 128, we are short-stacked (2.5 BB). Actually 158 is about 2.5 BB (BB is 64). So we are low on chips, need to survive.\n\nGiven we are short, we might consider shove all-in (raise to 158) to try to steal or get value if opponent has worse. But we have a pair, but opponent may have J, or overcards. If they have J, they'd have top pair, they'd call. If they have 2, they'd have pair of twos. If they have something else, they'd maybe fold.\n\nGiven we have 2.5 BB, typical strategy is to go all-in with any pair? But risk of being called by J or better. However we are short and need to accumulate.\n\nCheck? If we check, opponent may bet and we will be forced to call with weak hand, risking elimination. Better to shove now to either win pot or get all-in.\n\nThus raise to 158 (all-in). Legal? Minimum raise is 64, we have 158. So raise_to 158.\n\nReasoning: short stack, need to pick up chips, have some showdown value, but also want to pressure opponent.\n\nThus output.",

We have no clubs, so flush possible for opponent. We have gutshot? Actually we have a straight draw? Board: 2,4,9,10. We have 8,2. Could make straight 6-7-8-9-10? Need 6 and 7, not there. So not. So we have a pair of twos (top pair? No, 2c on board, we have 2h, so we have second pair, but board also has 2c, so we have a pair but opponent could have 2x for trips. Also board is heavily clubbed; any club gives flush. Also there is a possible straight? Not really. So our hand is weak.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) checked on turn. So they didn't bet. Preflop they called small blind? Actually preflop: seat4 (MiniMax) posted sb 1, then called 1 after BB posted 2? Wait preflop: seat4 post_sb 1, seat5 post_bb 2, seat4 call 1 (so they called sb, making 2 total). So they are in the pot with 2 chips each. Flop: both checked. Turn: MiniMax checked. So they are checking again. Could be weak, could be drawing, could be trapped.\n\nOur stack is 198 chips, pot is currently? Let's calculate: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, then SB called 1, so total 4? Actually SB posted 1, BB posted 2, SB called 1 (so adds 1 more). So total after preflop = 1+2+1 =4. Flop: both checked, pot remains 4. Turn: MiniMax checked, we have amount to call 0, pot remains 4. Minimum raise to 2 (so raise to 2). So we can check or raise to 2.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, and opponent checked, likely they have nothing or a draw. Raising could be a bluff, but we have short stack? Actually we have 198 chips (99 BB). So deep. Raising 2 is tiny, not much. Could check and see river. River card unknown yet. River could be club (flush possible for opponent), could be 8 to give us two pair? Actually board will be 5 cards: currently 4 clubs, plus river. If river is club, opponent could have flush. If river is 8, we get trips? Actually we have 8h, board no 8, so we would have pair of 8s plus pair of 2s? Actually we have 8h, board 8? No board doesn't have 8. So we would have one pair of 2s (our 2h with board 2c). Not strong. If river is 2, we get trips? Actually board already has 2c, we have 2h, so if river is 2, we have trips (three 2s). That would be strong.\n\nGiven the board is heavily clubbed, opponent might have a club. Checking could indicate they have a draw but not strong enough to bet. Could be they have a flush already? If they have flush they'd likely bet. So maybe they have a weak hand. We could try to steal pot with a small raise. But raising only 2 chips into pot 4 is not much, could be considered a value bet? Might not be effective.\n\nWe could check and see river, then decide. Since we have weak hand, better to check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. There's no bet to call, so folding is nonsense. So check.\n\nThus decision: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on river. Situation: BB with 8h 2h. Board: Tc 2c 9c 4c Td. So board has: Tc, 2c, 9c, 4c, Td. That's two pair? Actually board: Tc, 2c, 9c, 4c, Td => there are two tens (Tc, Td) and two clubs? Actually clubs: Tc, 2c, 9c, 4c are clubs, plus Td (diamond? Wait Td is ten of diamonds). So board: Ten of clubs, Two of clubs, Nine of clubs, Four of clubs, Ten of diamonds. So board is a flush draw but not completed: there are four clubs on board, but we have 8h 2h (both hearts). No club in hand. So opponent (MiniMax-M2) could have a club for a flush. Also board has pair of tens. Our hand: 8h 2h gives us a pair of twos (we have a 2 in hand matching board 2c). Actually board has a 2c, we have 2h, so we have a pair of twos (two pair? Actually board also has two tens, so board is two pair (tens and clubs? Wait clubs not a pair). Board: Tc, 2c, 9c, 4c, Td. That's pair of tens (Tc and Td). So board is already a pair of tens. Our 2h gives us a pair of twos, making us have two pair: tens and twos (but the tens are on board, we have no extra ten). Actually we have a pair of twos, but the board already has a ten pair, so our hand is two pair? Let's evaluate: Best five-card hand we can make from board + our hand: we can use the board's two tens, the board's 2c, and our 2h, plus the highest other card (9c). So we have two pair: tens and twos, kicker 9. Opponent could have a better hand: they could have a ten (making trips), could have a flush (any club), could have a straight? Board: T, 2, 9, 4, T. Straight possibilities: A 5? Not. No straight possible with board. Could have a full house? If opponent has a ten, they'd have three tens plus a pair (maybe 2s if they have a 2). If they have a club, they'd have flush (since four clubs on board, any club gives flush). If they have 2c? Already on board. So opponent's check on river indicates they likely have nothing strong, maybe missed draw. Our hand is currently second best to flush or trips. Since pot is only 4 chips, we have 198 stack, but we are in BB with 8h2h which is weak. Opponent checked. We can check back, no need to raise. Raising could be a bluff to try to win extra chips, but risk opponent calling with a flush? However opponent just checked, likely they have no club or ten. Could be a weak hand like Ace high, they may fold to a raise. But we have very weak hand, but also we have a decent showdown value: two pair vs many possible combos. The pot is tiny (4 chips). Raising could win extra chips if opponent folds, but also risk losing if they call with better hand. Since we have big stack relative to pot, we could attempt a small raise to steal? Minimum raise is 2. So raise to 2 (i.e., total 2). That would be a raise of 2 chips (since amount to call is 0). That would be a 2 chip bet. Opponent could call 2 chips. If they have a flush they'd call, we lose 2 chips. Not huge. Might be okay to raise as a semi-bluff? But we have no backdoor outs. However it's the river, no further betting. So raising is just to win extra chips. Since pot is 4, raising to 2 gives us pot odds? Actually we are betting 2 to win 4, 2:4 = 0.5 ratio. If opponent calls with any better hand, we lose 2. Might be acceptable. But also we could just check, get the 4 chips. I think best is check. Reason: we have a marginal hand; opponent checked, likely weak; raising could be unnecessary risk; also we want to preserve chips. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We'll check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Hand 2 river raise 24 (aggressive). Hand 5 turn bet 74 (big). So seems they can be aggressive, but also sometimes just call.\n\nOur hand 4J offsuit is weak. In SB facing a raise from UTG? Actually seat 4 is MP? Table seats: seat 1 Kimi-K2 (BB), seat 3 DeepSeek folded, seat 4 MiniMax-M2 (raised). Position: SB is after BB, before UTG? Actually SB is seat5, BB seat1, so seat4 is MP? Not sure. But we are out of position postflop.\n\nGiven weak hand, fold is typical. Could consider call if implied odds, but 4J is low suited, not good. Opponent's raise size is 4 (2 big blinds). Pot after raise: 7+1+2+4? Actually pot currently 7 (blinds). SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then raise to 4 (so total contributions: SB 1, BB 2, raise 4 => total 7? Actually raise means they added 2 more? But amount to call 3 suggests raise to 4 total, meaning they put 4 total, so added 2 more beyond BB. So pot now 1+2+4 =7, plus the call amount 3 would make pot 10. Not great.\n\nThus fold.\n\nWe should maybe recall opponent's range: raise to 4 is small, maybe wide. But still 4J not strong.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need decide action preflop in BB with Kh4h. Stack 190, blinds 1/2, pot 3. Opponent seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 367 chips, presumably in SB? Actually seat1 posted SB 1, seat5 posted BB 2. So seat1 is SB, seat5 BB. So we are in BB facing a raise? Actually amount to call is 1 (SB posted 1, BB posted 2). So after SB posted 1, BB posted 2 (forced). So now action is after SB? Actually order preflop: SB posts 1, BB posts 2, then action goes to UTG (seat2) but seat2 is folded, seat3 folded, seat4 folded, so it's back to SB (seat1) who can raise or check. The amount to call is 1 (meaning SB's raise? Actually SB posted 1, to call we need to match SB's bet? But SB already posted 1. The amount to call 1 likely means SB raised to 3? Wait minimum raise to is 4. That suggests current bet is 2? Let's interpret: BB posted 2, SB posted 1, then action goes to SB, they can raise. The amount to call is 1 (meaning to call the BB's 2? Actually from BB perspective, amount to call is 1 meaning SB has raised to 3? No, typical: After forced blinds, action starts with UTG, but since everyone folded, SB is first to act. If SB checks, then BB can check. But amount to call 1 suggests SB has raised to 3? Let's compute: BB posted 2, SB posted 1. If SB raises to 4 (minimum raise to 4), then amount to call for BB would be 4-2 =2? Not 1. If SB raises to 3 (just a raise of 1 over BB?), but minimum raise to is 4, so can't raise to 3. Actually minimum raise to is 4 meaning the total bet must be at least 4. So SB could raise to 4, which is a raise of 2 over BB's 2. Then BB would need to call 2. But amount to call shown is 1, so perhaps the action is after SB checked, and now BB can check (call 0) or raise. But amount to call 1? Hmm.\n\nMaybe the system defines amount to call as the amount needed to call the current bet (which is SB's 1). Since BB already posted 2, they are \"overcalled\"? Actually BB posted 2, which is bigger than SB's 1, so BB is already ahead. In that case, amount to call is 0 (BB can check). But they show amount to call 1, maybe they treat BB as needing to call SB's 1 to match? But BB posted 2, which is bigger, so they are already ahead. However maybe they treat the BB's forced blind as not counting toward call? Usually you can check in BB if SB checks. So amount to call should be 0. But given amount to call 1, maybe SB raised to 3 (so BB must call 1 more). Minimum raise to 4 indicates SB raised to 3 (bet 3) is allowed? Minimum raise to 4 suggests the current bet is 3, so raising must go to at least 4. So amount to call = 3 - 2 =1. Yes that fits: SB raised to 3 (total bet). That's a raise of 1 over BB's 2, but minimum raise is 2 (to 4). But maybe the system allows raise of 1? Hmm contradictory.\n\nNevertheless, we have to decide action: we have Kh4h, a weak hand, suited but low kicker. In BB facing a raise from SB (likely small raise), we should probably fold or call? With 95 BB stack, calling 1 chip is cheap. But hand is weak, not good for post-flop. However could see cheap flop. In tournament early stage, preserving chips is not critical but still. Typically you would fold K4 offsuit (unsuited) but it's suited hearts, but still weak. Many players fold K4 suited in BB vs raise. Since raise is minimal (maybe 3 total), calling 1 extra is cheap. Could also consider raising to isolate, but not strong enough.\n\nThus fold is safe. But maybe we can call to see flop cheap. Let's consider opponent: Kimi-K2 Thinking unknown tendencies. Could be tight? Not known. With 190 chips, we have 95 BB, deep enough. I think fold is reasonable.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. I'll choose fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

He checked to us on flop. Pot 71. He is in BB (seat3). Preflop action: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, Seat4 called 2, we called 2, then SB folded, BB raise 10, Seat4 call 8, we raise to 30, BB call 20. So preflop we raised and got called by BB, pot 71 includes blinds etc.\n\nNow flop: BB checked. We have top pair with decent kicker (9). Opponent's range likely includes Aces, Jacks, maybe 7x, maybe 8-9 combos, maybe straight draws, etc. He checked, maybe weak or trap. We can consider betting for value and protection. Our stack 160, we have 71 in pot, we have 130 remaining after our call? Actually we have 160 total, we have invested preflop: 2 (call) + 30 raise = 32? Actually we called 2, raised to 30 (so additional 28), total 30? Wait raise to 30 includes the 2 call? Preflop: we called 2, then raise to 30 (so we put total 30). So we have 160-30 =130 left. Pot 71 includes our 30, opponent's 20 call, plus others? Let's compute: SB 1, BB 2, Seat4 call 2, we call 2, then BB raise 10 (total 12?), Wait timeline: SB post 1, BB post 2, Seat4 call 2 (so puts 2), Seat5 call 2 (we call 2). SB fold. BB raise 10 (so adds 10 more, making his total 12). Seat4 call 8 (makes his total 10?). Actually seat4 had 2, call 8 = total 10. Then we raise to 30 (so we add 20 more beyond our 2). BB call 20 (makes his total 32). So pot after preflop: SB 1 (folded), BB 32, Seat4 10, us 30 = 73? plus maybe some? The pot listed as 71, close enough.\n\nNow flop: opponent checked, amount to call 0. Minimum raise 20. Legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nWe should consider betting. With top pair, decent kicker, we want value from weaker Jacks (like Jx) and maybe Ace. Also protect against draws. So raise is appropriate.\n\nSize: Pot 71, typical raise 2.5-3x pot for value. But we have 130 left, could raise to say 100 (total). Minimum raise is 20 (to 90? Wait raise_to is total amount we put in? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in, not additional. So if we raise to 90, we would be adding 90-30? Actually our current contribution to pot is 30 preflop, but on flop we haven't contributed yet. The raise_to amount is total amount we are putting in this street? Usually raise_to is total bet amount. So we need to set raise_to maybe 70 (i.e., bet 70). But the raise must be at least 20 (minimum raise to 20). The pot is 71, so a raise to 71+20=91? Actually minimum raise is current bet (0) + min raise amount (20) = 20. So we can bet any amount >=20. Usually we bet like 50-70.\n\nGiven stack 130, we could bet 80 (to 80). That would be about 1.1x pot. Could also bet 100 (1.4x pot). Considering opponent's range includes Aces, they may call with Ace high? Might fold. Might also have Jacks, they will call.\n\nWe also need tournament considerations: 80 BB stack, not huge but decent. We can afford a decent bet.\n\nThus I think raise to 80 (total bet 80). Reason: value and protection.\n\nCheck alternative: Could check and see turn. But opponent may give free card, dangerous for draws. So raise.\n\nThus answer: raise to 80.\n\n",

We have top pair, decent hand, can bet for value. Might raise to about half pot: pot 71, raise to 100? That's 100 total? Actually raise_to is total we put in, not additional. So if we raise to 100, we are adding 100 chips (since no bet). That's about 1.4x pot. Might be okay. Opponent's stack 214, could call. Might want to extract value but also protect against draws (A could be a higher pair? Actually opponent could have A? Board As, they could have A?? Actually As is on board, so opponent could have A with kicker. They could have A? But As is board, so they'd need another Ace for trips. Could have pocket Aces? That's unlikely. Could have set of 7? board 7c, could have 7x for set. So opponent could have set. But they checked. Checking with set is unlikely; they'd bet. So likely they have weak hand. So we can bet.

No ten on board. So currently we have overpair? No board has pair of eights, we have 10 high, not a pair. So we have just high card Ten, which is weak. Opponent bet 6, likely representing a hand. Our stack is 229, pot 10, bet 6 is 60% of pot. Call would be 6 into pot 16 (including bet). Odds: need to win > 6/22 = 27% to be profitable.

Actually SB posted 1, BB 2, seat4 called 2, so SB to act after seat4? The order: SB first posted 1, then BB posted 2, seat3 folded, seat4 called 2, now it's SB's turn, amount to call is 1 (to match BB's 2). So we can call 1, raise min to 4 total (i.e., raise 3 more). Hand Ah7s is a decent suited ace but low kicker. In SB, with 112.5 BB stack, we can consider raising to isolate. Opponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called BB, unknown tendencies. Seat1 is BB with 370 chips (big stack). He hasn't acted yet? Actually BB already posted 2, but hasn't acted preflop after seat4. In SB, after SB posts, BB posts, then UTG etc. But here seats: seat5 SB, seat1 BB, seat4 called, now SB acts. Actually order: SB first, then BB, then seat3 (UTG?) folded, seat4 (CO?) called, now it's SB again? Wait typical order: preflop action starts with UTG (seat after BB). But here we have only 3 players left: SB (seat5), BB (seat1), seat4 (seat4). The order after blinds: first player after BB is seat2 (folded), seat3 (folded), seat4 (call), seat5 (SB) already posted and is first to act? Actually SB posts before action, then first to act is UTG (seat2), then seat3, seat4, seat5 (SB) is last to act preflop. So SB acts last preflop. So we face a call of 1 to match BB's 2 (and seat4's 2). So we can raise.\n\nGiven Ah7s suited, it's a decent hand for a raise in SB to steal blinds and maybe isolate. But opponent seat4 just called, likely a wide range. BB seat1 hasn't acted yet; they have big stack and may 3-bet.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call, raise. With Ace-high suited, raising is typical to apply pressure and get value. Minimum raise to 4 total means raise 3 more (so total contribution becomes 4). That would be a raise of 2x the big blind (since BB is 2). That's a standard raise.\n\nConsider stack sizes: we have deep stack, can raise bigger but min is 4. Could also go all-in? No need.\n\nThus raise to 4 seems good.\n\nReasoning: Hand strength moderate, suited ace, position disadvantage but we can raise to steal, isolate. Also opponent seat4 called, likely wide, could fold to raise. BB may 3-bet, but we can fold if 3-bet.\n\nThus action: raise to 4.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with Ah7s. Board: 5s 6s 9d. So we have a flush draw (two spades on board, we have spade 7, plus Ace spade, so we have Ace-high flush draw, plus open-ended straight draw? Board 5-6-9, we have 7, so we have 5-6-7, need 8 for straight, also have Ace for gutshot? Actually 5-6-7, need 8 to make 5-6-7-8-9 straight, we have 9 on board, so we need 8 for straight. So we have both a flush draw and a gutshot? Actually we have 7s, board 5s6s9d. With 7s, we have 5-6-7, need 8 for straight. Also we have Ace spade for flush draw (need any spade). So we have strong draw.\n\nStack 222 chips. Pot 10 chips. Opponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) called preflop and is now in the hand. It's flop, amount to call 0 (since no bet). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 2. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies from recall: Past flop actions: He sometimes checks, sometimes calls, sometimes bets (hand 8). In 9 flops, he checked 4 times, called 4 times, bet once (6 chips). So mixed. He may be passive.\n\nWe are in BB, out of position vs him (he is MP? Actually seat 4 is left of us? Seat order: seat 5 is BB, seat 4 is before us (to our right). So he's in early position (UTG?). Actually seat numbers: 1 is SB, 2 is BB? Wait blinds: seat1 posted sb 1, seat5 posted bb 2? Actually preflop: seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So seat4 is MP maybe. Anyway we are SB? Actually seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB (small blind). So we are out of position after flop (SB is first to act). So we act first.\n\nWe have strong draw, want to build pot and maybe protect. Raising could make him fold weaker hands, or give us money if he calls. Since pot is small, raising to 2 (minimum) is good. Could also raise more to protect against draws. Our stack is deep relative to pot (222 vs 10). But tournament stage? Not given, but we have 111 BB, deep stack. So we can be aggressive.\n\nConsider opponent's range: He called preflop raise from SB (our raise to 4). He likely has a broad range: maybe suited connectors, pairs, etc. The board 5s6s9d hits many hands: 6x, 5x, spade draws, straight draws. He may have a made hand like 9x, 6x, 5x, maybe two pair, etc. Raising could isolate and get value if he has a made hand, but also could be called by draws.\n\nGiven we have strong draws, we could semi-bluff raise. Minimum raise to 2 is small, but we could raise to maybe 6? But legal raise minimum is 2 (total). We can raise to any amount up to our stack, but typical is 2-4. Since pot is 10, raising to 6 (i.e., bet 6) would be 0.6 pot, decent.\n\nBut we need to consider opponent's likely reaction: He has called preflop, so he may call our flop raise often. If we raise to 6, he'll call with many draws, but we still have equity.\n\nGiven tournament, preserving stack is okay. I'd raise to maybe 6 chips (total). Provide reasoning.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 6.\n\n",

Actually we need two more spades to make flush, so currently we have a flush draw with 2 outs? No, need 2 spades to complete flush, we have 2 spades in hand+board? We have 7s, board has 5s,6s.

Actually we have 5-6-7, need 8 or 4. 4 would give 4-5-6-7-? need 8? Not. So only 8 gives straight. So one-card straight draw (8). So we have a gutshot (one out). Also we have a pair of Aces? No, board has no Ace. So we have Ace high.\n\nPot size: 22 chips. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in seat 4. Stack: 193 chips. He called flop bet of 6. So now on turn, action: we are in BB, we acted last on flop (bet 6, opponent called). Now it's our turn on turn? Actually after flop betting round, we bet then opponent called, so turn action starts with us (BB) first? Usually action proceeds clockwise from the button. But since we are BB and we were first to act preflop, flop betting started with us (BB) bet, then opponent called. On turn, action starts with the player after the button? Actually button is seat1? Not sure. But given \"Amount to call: 0\" indicates it's our turn and we have no bet to call, we can check or bet/raise. Minimum raise to 6. So we can check or raise.\n\nOur hand is weak. Opponent's range: He called preflop raise (we raised to 4 from SB? Actually preflop: seat5 (us) raise 4, seat4 call 2 (actually call 2? Wait preflop: seat4 call 2 (call big blind), then seat5 raise 4 (SB?), need parse: Preflop: seat5 post_sb 1 (small blind 1). seat1 post_bb 2 (big blind 2). seat3 fold. seat4 call 2 (calls big blind). seat5 raise 4 (raise from small blind to 4). seat1 fold. seat4 call 2 (call raise). So we raised to 4 (total bet). Opponent called 2 more to match 4. So preflop we have a raise with A7 offsuit. Opponent likely has a wide range but perhaps medium.\n\nFlop: board 5s 6s 9d. We bet 6 into pot 22? Actually pot before flop bet: preflop pot: small blind 1 + big blind 2 + call 2 + raise 4 + call 2 = 11? Wait compute: SB 1, BB 2, seat4 call 2, seat5 raise 4 (so adds 3 more beyond SB?), Actually raise from 1 to 4 means extra 3, then seat4 call extra 2 to match 4 (so adds 2). So total chips: SB 1, BB 2, seat4 2+2=4, seat5 4 = 4? Not sure. Anyway pot 22 after flop betting: we bet 6, opponent called 6. So pot now 22 + 6+6 = 34? Actually they said Pot: 22 chips before flop? It says Pot: 22 chips (maybe after preflop). Then flop bet 6, call 6 makes pot 34. Now turn: pot 34? But they list amount to call 0, min raise 6.\n\nWe have weak hand, likely fold to raise.

Actually after flop betting round, we bet then opponent called, so turn action starts with us (BB) first? Usually action proceeds clockwise from the button. But since we are BB and we were first to act preflop, flop betting started with us (BB) bet, then opponent called. On turn, action starts with the player after the button? Actually button is seat1? Not sure. But given \"Amount to call: 0\" indicates it's our turn and we have no bet to call, we can check or bet/raise. Minimum raise to 6. So we can check or raise.\n\nOur hand is weak. Opponent's range: He called preflop raise (we raised to 4 from SB? Actually preflop: seat5 (us) raise 4, seat4 call 2 (actually call 2? Wait preflop: seat4 call 2 (call big blind), then seat5 raise 4 (SB?), need parse: Preflop: seat5 post_sb 1 (small blind 1). seat1 post_bb 2 (big blind 2). seat3 fold. seat4 call 2 (calls big blind). seat5 raise 4 (raise from small blind to 4). seat1 fold. seat4 call 2 (call raise). So we raised to 4 (total bet). Opponent called 2 more to match 4. So preflop we have a raise with A7 offsuit. Opponent likely has a wide range but perhaps medium.\n\nFlop: board 5s 6s 9d. We bet 6 into pot 22? Actually pot before flop bet: preflop pot: small blind 1 + big blind 2 + call 2 + raise 4 + call 2 = 11? Wait compute: SB 1, BB 2, seat4 call 2, seat5 raise 4 (so adds 3 more beyond SB?), Actually raise from 1 to 4 means extra 3, then seat4 call extra 2 to match 4 (so adds 2). So total chips: SB 1, BB 2, seat4 2+2=4, seat5 4 = 4? Not sure. Anyway pot 22 after flop betting: we bet 6, opponent called 6. So pot now 22 + 6+6 = 34? Actually they said Pot: 22 chips before flop? It says Pot: 22 chips (maybe after preflop). Then flop bet 6, call 6 makes pot 34. Now turn: pot 34? But they list amount to call 0, min raise 6.\n\nWe have weak hand, likely fold to raise. Checking is safe. Opponent",

Suits: we have Ah (hearts) and 7s (spades). Board has two spades (5s,6s). So we have a nut flush draw? Actually we have one spade, need two more spades for flush. There are two spades on board, we have one spade, so need two more spades on river to make flush, which is impossible (only one card left). So no flush draw. Straight draw? Board: 5-6-9-5. We have A7. Could we have a gutshot? 7 with 5-6 gives 5-6-7, need 8 for straight. Not present. 5-6-7-8-9 would be straight but need 8 and 9, we have 9 on board, need 8 on river to complete straight (5-6-7-8-9). That's an open-ended? Actually we have 5-6 on board, we have 7, need 8 to complete. That's a gutshot? No, we have 5-6-7, need 8-9 to complete? Wait a straight of 5-6-7-8-9 uses 5,6,7,8,9. We have 5,6,9 on board, 7 in hand, missing 8. So we need exactly 8 on river to make straight. That's a single-card draw (one-out). Also we have Ace high, maybe pair? No pair. So hand currently: A high, with gutshot draw to straight (8). Also possible backdoor flush? We have hearts Ace, board has no hearts, so no.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 is on the button? Actually seat 4. They called preflop raise, flop they called bet 6. Turn they bet 8. So they are showing aggression.\n\nPot size before turn bet: after flop, pot 30? Actually pot after flop: Preflop pot: 1+2+2+4+2? Let's compute: Preflop: seat5 posted sb 1, seat1 posted bb 2, seat4 call 2, seat5 raise 4 (so adds 4, total seat5 contributed 1+4=5?), seat1 fold, seat4 call 2 (so seat4 contributed 2+2=4). So preflop pot = 1+2+2+4+2 =11? Actually raise 4 means they put total 4? Usually raise to 4 means total bet 4 (including sb). So seat5 contributed 4 total, seat4 contributed 4 total (2 call + 2 call). So pot = 1+2+4+4 =11? Not sure but given pot on flop is 30 chips as per description. So after flop betting 6 each, pot becomes 30. Turn: seat5 check, seat4 bet 8. So pot before turn bet = 30. After seat4 bet 8, pot will be 38 if called, 30+8 =38. Amount to call 8. So pot odds: call 8 to win pot 38+8? Actually if call, you add 8, pot becomes 46 (30+8+8). So pot odds = 8/(46) = 17.4%. Need about 17% equity. Our chance: we have one-out (8). There are 46 unseen cards? Actually we have seen: our 2 cards, board 4 cards =6 known. Opponent unknown 2? Actually opponent has 2 unknown cards, but we consider outs ignoring opponent's cards. So remaining deck: 52-6 =46. Out of 46, one card (8) gives us straight. Also maybe other outs? If opponent has a pair, we could still have Ace high? Not enough. So only 1 out. Probability to hit on river = 1/46 \u2248 2.2%. That's far below pot odds 17%. So calling is not profitable. Could we raise? Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total bet 16). Raising would be even worse. So we should fold.\n\nBut consider tournament context: we have 216 chips, opponent 185 chips. Our stack is larger. Our hand is weak. Fold is correct.\n\nThus output JSON with action fold, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Wait compute: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, MiniMax call 2, BB raise 4 (so BB put 4 total? Actually BB posted 2 blind, then raise to 4 means additional 2? Usually raise to 4 total, so BB contributed 4. MiniMax call 2 additional (since already 2 in pot). So preflop pot: SB 1, BB 4, MiniMax 4? Actually MiniMax posted 2 blind? No, MiniMax is seat4, posted 2 (call) after BB raise.

Could we consider a bluff raise? We have 108 BB, deep stack, but opponent's behavior: they bet on turn often (multiple times). In recall, they bet 74 on turn in hand5 (big), bet 6 on turn in hand15 (small), bet 8 on turn hand16 (like this), bet 24 on turn hand19. So they are aggressive on turn, possibly semi-bluffing with draws. Board has a possible flush draw (two spades on board, we have one spade, they could have spade draw). Also paired board, could have full house. Our A7 is not strong. Likely fold. So action fold.\n\nReturn JSON.",

We need to decide fold/call/raise.\n\nWe have Tc Qd suited? No, Qd and Tc are different suits (clubs and diamonds). So offsuit.\n\nHand strength: QcTc is decent, but not premium. In BTN vs raise from MP (seat4). Stack sizes: opponent 207 chips, about 51.75 BB. Our stack 54 BB. Raise size 8 (2x BB). So it's a standard open raise from MP? Actually it's a raise from seat4 (likely MP). He raised 8 (2x BB). That's a small raise. We could call and see flop. QcTc offsuit is a decent hand in BTN, can be played profitably.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall shows MiniMax-M2 raised 4 previously (preflop) in two earlier hands. That suggests maybe they raise small amounts, perhaps wide range.\n\nOur position: BTN, best position post-flop. Stack deep enough.\n\nPot odds: To call 8 to win pot of 14+8 = 22? Actually pot currently 14 (SB+BB+raise). To call 8 adds to pot, making total 22 after call. So we are getting 22/8 = 2.75:1 pot odds, need ~36.4% equity. QcTc vs unknown range likely >36%? Might be borderline. But we have position.\n\nGiven we have a decent hand and position, could call and try to see flop. Raising could be possible to isolate and build pot. Minimum raise is 12 (total). That would be raise to 12, adding 4 more beyond call. That would be a small raise. Might be okay.\n\nBut we must consider risk: If opponent is aggressive and can 3-bet, raising might invite a 3-bet. But with 54 BB, we can handle.\n\nI think best action: call. Reason: decent hand, good position, pot odds okay, opponent likely raising wide.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #25. We're BTN with A\u2660 T\u2660? Actually Ad Ts (Ace diamonds, Ten spades). Position BTN, stack 202 chips (~50 BB). Blinds 2/4. SB posted 2, BB posted 4. MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) raised to 8 (so min raise to 12). So action to call 8 (i.e., total 8 to call? Actually amount to call is 8, meaning they raised to 8, so we need to put 8 total? Wait: In pot, SB 2, BB 4, raise to 8 means they added 4 more (since BB 4). So amount to call is 8 - we have to put 8 total, but we already have 0, so call 8. Minimum raise to 12 (so raise to 12 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: A T suited is a decent hand, especially from BTN vs raise from MP (seat 4 likely is MP? Actually seat numbers: Seat 1 SB, seat 3 BB, seat 4 is under the gun? The positions: Seat numbers 1-8. Seat 5 is BTN. So seat 4 is CO (cutoff) maybe. So MiniMax-M2 is in CO raising to 8 (2x BB). That's a standard raise. A T suited is a good hand to 3-bet or call depending on opponent tendencies. Need to recall opponent's raise patterns. We have recall data: MiniMax-M2 raises amounts: 4, 8, 48, 8, 8. So they sometimes raise larger (48) maybe when they have strong hand. But typical raise is 8 (2x BB). In hand 21 they raised to 48 (big raise). So they can be aggressive.\n\nWe need to decide whether to 3-bet. Stack 202, we can 3-bet to maybe 24 (6x BB) or larger. Considering tournament, 50 BB stack, we can apply pressure.\n\nWe might want to 3-bet to isolate and take pot. A T suited has good equity vs many hands. Also we are in position. The opponent's raise is small, so 3-bet is good.\n\nBut we also need to consider that there are still players left? SB and BB haven't acted yet after us; they could call or fold. If we raise, they might fold, we get heads-up. If we call, we risk being out of position after flop? Actually we are in position, but after raise from CO, SB and BB act after us (since we are BTN). So if we call, we will be out of position? The action order: after raise, SB acts, then BB, then us (BTN). So if we call, we will be after them? Actually order: SB (seat1) posted 2, BB (seat3) posted 4, raise from seat4, then SB, BB, BTN. So if we call, we are last to act preflop, but after us is flop with us in position (BTN). So still good.\n\nGiven raise is 8, calling puts 8 in pot, leaving us with 194 chips left. 3-bet to maybe 24 would be a decent size (6BB). That would be a raise of 16 more (total 24). Minimum raise is 12, but we can raise larger.\n\nWe should consider opponent's tendencies: MiniMax-M2 sometimes raises big (48). That could indicate they sometimes do 3-bets themselves? Actually 48 is huge (12x BB). That could be a 3-bet from them after a raise? But we only have preflop raises. Not sure.\n\nGiven we have strong hand, I think 3-bet. Let's raise to maybe 24. Reason: isolate, build pot, leverage position.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 24.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "content": "We need to decide action on turn. Board: 2s 2h Qd 3d. Our hand: Ad Ts (Ace of diamonds, Ten of spades). So we have Ace-high, plus a backdoor flush draw (diamond) with Ace of diamonds gives us nut flush draw? Actually board has two diamonds (Qd, 3d). We have Ad, so we have Ace of diamonds, giving us a nut flush draw (any diamond would give us flush, Ace is highest). Also we have a gutshot? Straight draw? Board: 2,2,Q,3. Ten gives us open-ended? No. Ten with Q could make straight? Ten-J-Q-K? Not. So only flush draw.\n\nAlso we have pair of 2s on board, opponent may have 2x for set. Our hand currently is Ace-high, not a made hand. Turn check from opponent (MiniMax-M2). Pot is 54. We are on button, stack 178. Minimum raise 16. Options: check or raise.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, MiniMax-M2 on flop often checks, sometimes bets small, occasionally big bets. On turn, they have checked this time. Likely a weak hand or drawing. Could be a set of 2s, or a queen, or a flush draw, or a straight draw? Board: 2-2-Q-3. They could have Qx, 2x, maybe a straight draw like A-K? Not. So they might have a made hand (set) or a draw (flush draw). Our raise could apply pressure, maybe steal the pot if they are weak. However we have a flush draw; raising could also build pot for when we hit flush.\n\nBut we have only 44.5 BB, still decent stack. Opponent has 277 chips (about 69 BB). So we could raise to maybe 30-40 chips to apply pressure. But need to consider risk: if they have set, they will call or raise. If we raise and they call, pot becomes larger and we risk more chips if we miss flush.\n\nCheck: we could check, see if they bet later (turn already checked). Actually we are on turn after opponent checked, it's our action. If we check, we go to river for free. River card unknown. Could be a diamond completing flush. If we check, we keep pot small and can decide on river.\n\nGiven we have only Ace-high, raising may be a bluff. Opponent may call with any pair, queen, etc. Might be risky.\n\nWhat is pot odds? If we raise to 16 (minimum) we risk 16 to win 54 + 16 = 70 pot, giving us 70/16 ~ 4.4:1. That's about 18% equity needed. Our hand equity? Ace-high vs unknown range: likely less than 20%? Might be borderline. But we also have flush draw: about 9 outs (diamonds: we have Ace, board has Qd, 3d, so remaining diamonds: 13-2=11? Actually diamonds: A, Q, 3 are on board or in hand. Remaining diamonds: K, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 2? Wait 2 of diamonds not on board (board has 2s and 2h, not diamond). So there are 13 diamonds total, we have Ad, board has Qd, 3d. So remaining: Kd, Jd, Td, 9d, 8d, 7d, 6d, 5d, 4d, 2d. That's 10 outs. Actually also maybe 2d is a diamond but board has 2s 2h, so 2d is an extra 2, but would give us a full house? Actually if a 2 appears, we would have trips of 2s? But we have Ace-high, not relevant. So 10 outs. On river, chance ~10/46 = 21.7%. So equity with flush draw about 22% plus current hand value maybe 5%? So overall maybe 27% equity. That's above 18% needed to call a raise of 16. So raise to 16 is profitable EV if opponent calls with any hand less than our equity? Actually we are raising as bluff, but we also have some equity. If opponent folds, we win 54 pot. If they call, we have 27% chance to win ~ (pot after call) 70. So expected value = fold prob * 54 + call prob * (0.27*70 - 0.73*16). We need estimate opponent call frequency. If they call only with strong hands maybe 30%? Hard.\n\nGiven opponent's pattern:"

          "reasoning_content": "We need decide action on river. Situation: we have Ad Ts. Board: 2s 2h Qd 3d 6c. So board pairs 2s2h, queen, 3, 6. No flush possible (two diamonds on board, we have none). Straight possibilities? Board: 2,2,3,6,Q. We have A T. No straight. Our hand: Ace high with Ten kicker. Opponent MiniMax-M2 checked river. Pot 102 chips. Our stack 154, we have 38.5 BB. Opponent's stack 253. He checked, we can check or bet (raise). Need to consider opponent's range. Preflop: He raised 8 from UTG? Actually seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised 8 (2 BB) from early position? He called our 24 raise preflop, so we 3-bet to 24. He called. So preflop he is willing to call a 3-bet with a range that includes strong hands, maybe broadway, suited connectors, pairs, etc. Flop: board 2s 2h Qd. He checked, we checked. Turn: board 3d, he checked, we bet 24, he called. So his call to our turn bet indicates some hand with maybe a pair, a draw, or a weak queen? He might have a queen, a 2, a 3, a 6, a straight draw? He called 24 into pot 78 (pre-turn pot?). Let's compute pot sizes: Preflop: we raised to 24, he called 16 (since he had posted 4 blind). So pot after preflop: 2+4+8+24+16 = 54? Actually blinds 2+4 =6. Our raise to 24 adds 20 more (we already posted 4). He called 16 extra (since he posted 4). So total: 6 + (24-4) + (16) = 6+20+16=42. Wait compute: contributions: Seat1 post_sb 2 (SB), Seat3 post_bb 4 (BB). Seat4 raise 8 (so adds 8-4=4 extra). Seat5 raise 24 (adds 24-4=20 extra). Seat4 call 16 (adds 16-4=12). So total contributions: SB 2, BB 4, seat4 8+12 =20, seat5 24. Sum = 2+4+20+24 =50. So pot after preflop = 50.\n\nFlop: board 2s 2h Qd. Seat4 check, seat5 check. No bets, pot remains 50.\n\nTurn: board 3d. Seat4 check, seat5 bet 24, seat4 call 24. So pot after turn: 50 + 24 (our bet) + 24 (call) = 98.\n\nRiver: seat4 check, amount to call 0, pot 102 (they added 4 more maybe from blinds? Actually after turn pot 98, then seat4 check, seat5 could bet but they check, so pot remains 98? But given pot 102, maybe there is 4 from something else? Might be rounding. Anyway pot ~102.\n\nWe have Ace high. Opponent likely has something better than Ace high: could have queen, pair of 2s, 3, 6, maybe a straight draw missed. He called turn bet, so likely has a hand with showdown value: maybe a queen (Qx), a 2 (pair), a 3 (pair of 3?), a 6 (pair), a straight draw (like 4-5) but missed. Could also have a bluff, but less likely.\n\nOur hand is weak, likely losing. Should we check? Probably check to avoid losing more chips. If we bet, we risk being called and losing 24 (or more) with Ace high. Could we attempt a bluff? River board has paired 2s, queen high, and we have Ace high. Opponent may have queen, which beats us. So bluff unlikely to succeed. Also our stack is 154, pot 102, we could bet 24 (minimum raise) making pot ~126, we risk 24 more. If opponent folds, we win 102. But opponent likely has queen or pair and would call. So better to check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nLegal actions include raise, but we choose check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

No need 7 or T? Let's think: Straight combos: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 7), 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 7 and T? Actually you need 7 and T? Wait you have 8,9,6. For 6-7-8-9-10 you need both 7 and T. That's not possible with one card. So only open-ended draw is 7 to make 6-7-8-9-? Actually need also 5? Straight 5-6-7-8-9 needs 7 and 5? You have 6,8,9, need 7 and 5. Not possible. So actually you have only a gutshot? Let's enumerate possible straights containing 6,8,9: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 5 and 7), 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 7 and 10). So you need two cards. So you have no straight draw. You have two overcards (K,Q) vs board. Board is relatively low, no flush draws (two diamonds, one heart, one club). So hand is just K high, Q high. Not strong.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 bet 8 into pot 34, so pot now 42 after bet? Actually pot was 34, bet 8 adds to pot 42, we need call 8 to see turn.\n\nWe need to decide: call, raise, or fold. Our hand likely weak. Opponent's bet size is 8 (half pot). Could be continuation bet, could be trying to steal. Our stack 238, opponent stack 207. Opponent's tendencies: from recall we have three prior flop bets: amounts 6, 40, 12. Mixed sizes. No info on aggression.\n\nGiven we have KQ, could be decent showdown value if opponent has lower pair or draws. But board 8-9-6, opponent could have 8,9,6, or straight draw. Our KQ is decent overcards. But we are out of position (BB vs opponent in seat 4, which is UTG? Actually seat 4 is maybe MP). We are out of position post-flop.\n\nGiven tournament, stack 59.5 BB, not short. Probably fold to avoid losing 8 chips with weak hand. However maybe call to see turn if opponent is bluffing. The bet is small relative to pot, could be a probe.\n\nWhat is pot odds? Pot 34 + 8 bet = 42, call 8 to win 42, odds = 8/42 = 0.19, need 19% equity. Our hand vs unknown could be >19%? With KQ vs random? Might be around 30%? But opponent may have made a bet with range including many hands, our equity maybe lower. But we have two overcards, could be decent.\n\nGiven we have no draw, just showdown value, maybe call.\n\nBut consider opponent's previous flop bets: one was 6 (small), one 12 (small), one 40 (large). So they vary. Not enough.\n\nI think call.\n\nThus JSON: action call, raise_to null.\n\n",

Currently pot 42, turn check from opponent (MiniMax-M2). We are in BB, stack 230, opponent stack 207. Opponent checked, we can check or raise. What is opponent's likely range? Preflop they called raise 12 (so they have 8-9? Actually they called 12 after raise to 12? Preflop: we raised to 12, they called 8 (since they posted 4 bb, call 8). So they have a calling range: could be broadway, suited connectors, etc. On flop, board 8d 9h 6c, they bet 8 (small). We called. So they may have middle pair, draws, etc. Turn is 7h, giving board 8-9-6-7, making a straight draw for us (open-ended). Also board now has 8-9-7-6, no pair yet. Opponent checked. Likely they missed the straight, maybe have 8x, 9x, 67, etc. Could be a pair of 8s or 9s? They might have 8? If they had 8, they'd have top pair with a gutshot? Actually board has 8,9,6,7. If they have 8, they'd have pair. Might check to see if we bet. We have strong draw, equity high. Should we bet to represent a made hand and maybe get value if they have 8/9? Also we could check to induce bluffs later. Considering tournament, stack moderate, we can raise to build pot if we hit. Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8? Actually raise amount total must be at least 8 more than call? Minimum raise to 8 means total bet of 8? Since amount to call is 0, raising to 8 is a bet of 8. That is small. Could raise bigger, but only legal actions: raise (any amount up to stack). We can raise to maybe 30 or 40 to price in. Opponent stack 207, pot 42, we could bet ~20-30 to apply pressure.\n\nGiven open-ended straight draw, pot odds: need 5 or T. Two outs? Actually 4 outs each? Straight: need 5 or T, 4 cards each (four 5s, four Ts) = 8 outs. Plus maybe backdoor flush diamond: two more outs (if 5d or Td). So about 10 outs. On turn, we have 1 card left (river). Probability to hit: 10/46 \u2248 21.7%. So equity ~22% plus current hand maybe some showdown value if opponent has pair? Our hand currently is just high cards, no pair. If opponent has 8 or 9, they'd be ahead. So we need to consider pot odds: pot 42, if we bet 20, we risk 20 to win 62 (pot+bet). That's 20/62 = 32% needed. Our equity 22% < 32, not good. If we bet smaller 8, risk 8 to win 50, need 16% equity, which we have 22% > 16, so good. So small bet is +EV.\n\nThus we should raise (bet) to minimum 8 to apply pressure. Reason: we have decent equity and can fold if they raise. Also could check, but betting may win pot now.\n\nThus action: raise to 8. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

My hand has virtually no showdown value, and the pot odds (\u224835%) do not justify a call. Folding preserves my stack.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action facing river bet 66 into pot 124, we have Kd Qc. Board: 8d 9h 6c 7h 2h. So board is 8-9-6-7-2 with two hearts (9h,7h). Our hand Kd Qc gives us straight? Let's see: board has 6,7,8,9. That's a 6-7-8-9 straight draw. We have K and Q, which gives us a gutshot? Actually Q completes a straight 6-7-8-9-10? No, Q is not 10. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 5), 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 10). We have K and Q, so no straight. Could we have a flush? Two hearts on board, we have no hearts. So no flush. So we have just high cards K and Q, which is not a made hand; best we have is King high. The board is fairly coordinated, could be many draws. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 66 on river. Pot before river bet: after turn, pot? Let's compute: Preflop: we raised to 12, opponent called 8 (so put 8). So pot after preflop: 12+8+ blinds? Blinds are 2 (SB) and 4 (BB). SB posted 2 (seat3) but folded, BB posted 4 (seat4) but then we raised? Actually seat4 posted BB 4, then we raised to 12 (so extra 8). So preflop contributions: SB 2 (folded), BB 4 (call?), but then we raise 12, so seat4 (BB) call 8? Actually seat4 is BB, they posted 4, then they called the raise? The action shows seat4 call 8 (so they put additional 8). So preflop contributions: seat5 (us) 12, seat4 8+4=12? Actually seat4 posted 4 blind then called 8, total 12. So pot = 2+12+12 = 26? Wait SB 2, BB 4, then raise to 12 (so we put 12), BB calls 8 (total 12). So total chips: SB 2, BB 12, us 12 = 26. Yes pot 26 preflop.\n\nFlop: seat4 bet 8, seat5 call 8. So add 16 to pot => pot 42.\n\nTurn: seat4 check, seat5 bet 8, seat4 call 8. Add 16 => pot 58.\n\nRiver: seat4 bet 66, we face 66 to call. So pot before river bet = 58. After bet, pot would be 58+66 =124 (matches given pot). So we need to call 66 to win 124. Pot odds = 66/ (66+124?) Actually call amount 66 to win 124+66? Wait after call, total pot = 124+66 =190. So odds = 66/190 = 34.7% needed. Our hand is King high, basically a bluff-catcher? Opponent may be betting as bluff or value. Board is 8-9-6-7-2. Could opponent have a straight? They could have 5 or 10. Could have a pair, two pair, trips, etc. Our KQ is not a made hand; we likely lose most of time. So folding is correct.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: recall shows they raised river 24 once, checked twice, folded once. Not much data. Probably they bet for value with decent hand. So we fold.\n\nWe have stack 222, calling would leave 156. Not huge.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

Opponent's flop tendencies: from recall, they have checked in hand #25, but also bet in others. Mixed. But given board, they might bet if they have a set or queen. Since they checked this time, they likely have nothing strong or are pot controlling. We could consider checking back to see turn cheaply. Raising could be a bluff but we have no equity, and raise size min 4 (to total 4?). Actually raise to 4 means raise to total 4? Minimum raise to 4, pot 8, raise to 4 would be less than pot? Actually raise to total 4 chips from 0? That seems odd; but rule: raise_to is total amount we put in. So raise to 4 means we bet 4 chips. That is a small bet, maybe a bluff. But we have weak hand and opponent may have queen or set, they'd likely call or raise. Might lose more. Better to check and preserve stack. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise.

Table: seat 1 is BB, seat 4 is MP? Not sure but seat 4 is likely UTG? Anyway they raised to 8 (3x BB). That's a standard raise. AK is a premium hand, should 3-bet. Stack is deep 54 BB, can 3-bet to maybe 2.5-3x raise size. Minimum raise is 12 (i.e., to 12 total). That is a small 3-bet but we could raise more. We can also call. But 3-betting is typical to isolate and build pot. Opponent's raise pattern: they sometimes raise 4 (small), 8, 48, 28. They have raised 8 multiple times, also 48 (big). So they may be variable. With AK, a 3-bet is advisable.\n\nWe need to decide raise amount. Legal actions: we can raise to any amount >=12. Typically we could raise to about 3x the original raise: original raise was 8 total, so 3x is 24. Considering stack 54 BB, we could raise to 20-25. Let's choose 24 total (i.e., raise to 24). That would be additional 22 chips (since we have already 2 posted, need to add 22 to make total 24). That's a decent 3-bet.\n\nReasoning: strong hand, position, deep stack, want to isolate, opponent's raise size moderate, we can apply pressure.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

MiniMax-M2 checked, likely with a weaker hand or a draw. Betting extracts value from hands like QJ, AQ, or draws and protects against potential spade draws. A moderate raise to 30 (~0.75 pot) balances value and risk.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have flop: Ks 4s Qc. Our hand: Kc Ad => top pair top kicker (pair of Kings with Ace kicker). Also a nut flush draw? Actually we have Kc and Ad, board has Ks, 4s, Qc. We have one spade (Kc is club, Ad is diamond). Board has two spades (Ks and 4s). So we have a flush draw with two spades on board, we have zero spades, so we need two spades for flush, not a draw. Straight draw? Board: K Q 4, we have A, K. Potential straight? A K Q J 10? Not possible. So we have top pair, decent hand. Opponent MiniMax-M2 is in the pot. He raised preflop to 8 (small raise) then we 3-bet to 24, he called. So he's a caller of 3-bet. On flop, it's his turn to act first? Actually order: preflop: seat 4 raise, seat5 raise, seat4 call. So seat5 is BB, seat4 is UTG? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2. After flop, action order: seat4 acts first (since he is earlier seat). The flop is checked to us (amount to call 0). So MiniMax-M2 checked. We have top pair. We could bet for value and protect against draws. What is pot size? 52 chips. Our stack 194. Minimum raise to 16 (so raise must be at least 16 total). So a bet of 16 (to 16) is a raise (since amount to call is 0). That would be 16 total, which is about 1/3 pot. Could also check. Opponent's tendencies: from recall, he sometimes checks flop with weak hands, sometimes bets. In hand 30, he bet flop 8 into pot (size unknown). In hand 31, he checked flop, then bet turn 4. So he's capable of both. Given we have top pair, we likely want value. Also we want to protect against possible straight draws? Not many. There's potential backdoor flush draw for him? He could have spades. If he has spade flush draw (e.g., As 9s) board has two spades, he'd have two spades in hand to make flush. He could have open-ended straight draw? With K Q 4, possible draws: J10 (needs J and 10), not many combos. So not many draws.\n\nThus betting for value is good. How much? Minimum raise 16. Could raise bigger maybe 30-40 to get value from KQ, AQ, etc. But we have only 48.5 BB, still medium stack. Opponent has 237 chips, larger stack. Might want to size to get value but not risk too much. A bet of 30 would be about 0.75 pot, still okay. Minimum raise is 16, but we can raise higher. The legal actions are fold, check, raise. So we can raise to any amount >=16 up to our stack. Should we consider check? Checking gives free card but could allow opponent to see a turn cheap. Might give him chance to improve. Betting also protects.\n\nThus I will raise to 30 chips (total). Reasoning: top pair, value, protect, opponent likely calls with worse hands. So action: raise 30.\n\n",

Actually we have Kc, board has Ks, so we have a pair of Kings, with Ace kicker. Also we have a nut flush draw? Board has two spades (Ks, 4s). Our hand has Kc Ad, no spade. So no flush draw. Straight possibilities: board Qc 6d plus we have Kc Ad, we have Ace high, possible straight draw? Need J and T for straight, not present. So we have top pair, decent. Opponent is MiniMax-M2, seat 4. Preflop: they raised to 8, we 3-bet to 24, they called. Flop: board K 4 Q. We bet 30 into pot 112? Actually pot before flop bet: preflop pot: blinds 2+4 + raise 8 + call 24? Let's compute: preflop: SB 2, BB 4, raise to 8 (so additional 6 from BB?), Actually seat4 raise to 8 (so they put 8 total). Seat5 (us) raise to 24 (so we put 24 total). Seat4 call 16 (they put additional 16 to match 24). So preflop pot: SB 2 + BB 4 + seat4 8+16 = 24? Wait seat4 initially 8 then added 16 = 24 total. Seat5 24 total. So total = 2+4+24+24 = 54. Then flop bet 30 by us, call 30 by seat4. So pot after flop: 54 + 30+30 = 114. But they say pot 112, close enough.\n\nNow turn: board adds 6d. Pot 112. It's our turn? Actually seat5 is BB, seat4 is opponent. After flop bet/call, it's seat5's turn to act on turn? Typically action proceeds from left of dealer, which is seat5? Actually positions: seat5 is BB, seat4 is MP? Not sure. But given actions, we have amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. So it's our turn (seat5) to act on turn, with no bet outstanding. So we can check or bet/raise.\n\nWe have top pair K with Ace kicker. Opponent's range: preflop raise 8, call 3-bet. Likely strong hands: AK, AQ, AJ, KQ, maybe TT, etc. Flop K Q, they called our bet. They could have KQ (made two pair), AK (top pair K with Ace kicker), AQ (pair Q), QJ (pair Q), maybe a set of 4s? No 4 on board, set of 6? No. They could have a straight draw like JT, but not many combos.\n\nWe bet 30 on flop, they called. That suggests they have something but not strong enough to raise. Could be Kx, Qx, or a draw.\n\nNow turn 6d. Does this change anything? No spade, no straight. If they have AK, they have Ace kicker too, but we have Ace too, but we have Kc, they could have As? Actually we have Ad, so opponent cannot have Ace of diamonds. They could have Ace of hearts/clubs/spades. If they have AK, they'd have Ace + King, they'd have two pair K and A? Actually board K Q 4, they'd have K and A, they'd have top pair K with Ace kicker, same as us but we have Ace of diamonds, they have Ace of something else, they'd also have pair of Kings (board) and Ace kicker. So they'd tie if they have AK. If they have KQ, they'd have two pair K and Q, we have just K pair, so they'd be ahead.\n\nIf they have AQ, they'd have pair of Q, we have pair of K, we are ahead. If they have JJ, they'd have gutshot? Not.\n\nThus we have decent hand, maybe ahead of many.\n\nConsider stack sizes: we have 164 chips, opponent 207. Pot 112. If we bet, we can size to maybe 60-80 to protect. Opponent could raise all-in if they have two pair or set. But there is no set possibility (board no pair). Two pair possible: KQ, K4, Q4. KQ is strong, they might have it. If they have KQ, they'd be ahead of us; we would lose if we call a raise. So we might want to check to see if they bet. If they bet large, we"

          "reasoning_content": "We have river decision. Our hand: Kc Ad. Board: Ks 4s Qc 6d 3h. So we have top pair (K) with Ace kicker, plus we have a pair of Kings (pair K) and Ace high. The board has possible straight draws: Q-J-10-9-8? Not present. Board: K Q 6 4 3. Straight possibilities: A K Q J 10 (we have A K Q but missing J10). Also possible straight with 5-4-3-2-A? We have 4-3 on board, but no 5 or 2. So no immediate straight. Flush possibility: Two spades on board (Kc is club, board has Ks (king of spades) and 4s (spade). Actually board: Ks (spade), 4s (spade). That's two spades. Our hand: Kc (club) and Ad (diamond). So we have no spade. So no flush.\n\nPotential for opponent having two pair or trips: Board has K Q 6 4 3. Opponent could have Qx for two pair Q-K? Actually board already has K and Q, so if opponent has Qx they'd have two pair Q-K. Could also have 6x for two pair 6-K etc. Or could have a set: If they have Kx they'd have set of Kings (but we have Kc, board has Ks, so they could have another King? Only one King left: Kd? Actually there are four kings: Kc (our), Ks (board), Kh, Kd. So opponent could have Kh or Kd, giving them a set (three of a kind) with board king. That's strong. Could also have a set of Qs if they have Qx, but board has Qc only one queen, so they'd need Qd, Qh, Qs for set. So possible.\n\nAlso could have a straight draw that missed, but likely they have something like a made hand.\n\nWe are on the river, pot is 112, opponent (MiniMax-M2) last action? The actions listed: turn: both checked. So on river, it's our turn (BB). Amount to call 0, min raise 30. So we can check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot check if we want to bet? Actually we can check (do nothing). Raising would be a bet.\n\nWe need to decide whether to bet for value or check. Our hand is top pair with Ace kicker, but there are possible better hands: set of Kings (Kx), set of Queens, two pair QK, maybe straight? Not likely. So we have decent but not best.\n\nWe need to consider opponent's tendencies. Recall opponent actions: In recent hand 30, on river they bet 66 into pot? Let's see: hand 30: river bet 66. That suggests they sometimes bet on river. In hand 30 they had board? Unknown. In hand 31 they bet 4 on turn. So they are somewhat aggressive.\n\nBut we need to decide best action: likely check to avoid getting raised and losing more chips, unless we think opponent will call a bet with worse hand (like a queen high). But they could also have a set and raise.\n\nGiven we have 164 chips (41 BB). Pot 112, so bet of 30 would be about 27% of pot, maybe value bet. If we bet 30, opponent may call with weaker hands like Qx, 6x, etc. But also may raise if they have set.\n\nWhat about stack sizes? Opponent stack unknown, but they have 207 chips (they are seat 4). So they have more chips.\n\nWe need to decide best EV. Usually with top pair top kicker on river, it's a marginal hand. Often checking is safe to avoid being raised. However, if opponent is capable of checking down with worse hands, we could extract value by betting. But risk of being raised and losing more.\n\nWe can try to recall opponent's river behavior: In hand 30, they bet 66 on river. What was the board? Unknown. But they were aggressive. In hand 31 they bet 4 on turn, not river.\n\nGiven limited info, I'd lean to check to avoid risk.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

So UTG with KQs is a strong hand but in early position with 69 BB, typical open raise to 8 (2x big blind) is standard. Considering opponent tendencies: DeepSeek raises frequently, sometimes large. Raising could isolate. We could also consider 3-bet? But we are first to act (UTG), blinds posted, no raise yet. So we can either raise to 8 (standard) or call (just limp). LIMP is weak; better raise. So action: raise to 8. Reason: strong hand, early position, need to build pot, isolate, and opponent may 3-bet; we have good equity.\n\nThus JSON.",

Opponent may have a hand like a set (2s?), but board has two 2s, so only set is 2x? Actually there are three 2s on board (2c,2d, plus any 2 in hand). So opponent could have a 2 for trips. Also could have a set of 3? No only one 3. Could have a straight draw? Not likely. Could have a flush draw? No clubs on turn, only two clubs on board, need two more clubs.\n\nOur hand is weak. We have 67 BB, opponent has 292 chips. We are short stacked relative? Not extremely short; we have 67 BB, opponent 73 BB approx. Actually 292/4 =73 BB. So similar.\n\nWe should likely fold. Check legal actions: fold, check, raise. We can check (no bet). But we could also consider raising as bluff? But board is not favorable; we have no equity. Opponent may have a hand like 22 (set), or a hand like AK etc. Our raise would be 4 min raise to 4? Actually minimum raise is 4 (to total 4?). But we have already contributed 8 preflop and 0 on flop, pot 22. If we raise to 4, that would be weird because raise must be at least amount to call + min raise. Since amount to call is 0, min raise is 4, so raise to 4 total? That would be less than current pot, but allowed. But that would be a very small raise, maybe a probe. However we have no hand, and opponent may call with anything better. So best is to check and hope opponent checks behind? But we could also fold if we think opponent will bet. But we have no bet to call now. The action is on turn, amount to call 0, we can check. If we check, opponent may bet later on river. If we think opponent's range is strong, we might want to fold now? But we can't fold when there's no bet; folding means surrendering our hand and conceding the pot, which is fine. So we can just check and see later. But we need to decide best action: likely check (or fold? but folding now gives up pot). In poker, you cannot fold when there's no bet? Actually you can \"fold\" meaning you discard your hand and forfeit the pot. That is allowed. So we could fold now and give up the 22 pot. But checking is better because we still have chance to see river and maybe win if opponent checks and we get to showdown with K high? But we likely lose.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, but we have some chance if opponent checks and we go to showdown, we lose anyway because opponent likely has something. But maybe opponent could be bluff-catching? Unlikely.\n\nThus I'd choose check, to see opponent's action. Reason: weak hand, no equity, but we can check to avoid building pot.\n\nThus output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #35 preflop. Position: BB (seat5). Cards: 9s 7s (suited connectors). Stack 264 chips, 66 BB. Blinds 2/4. Pot currently 28 chips (includes blinds: SB 2, BB 4, plus raise from seat3 12, call from seat4 10? Actually seat3 raise 12 (so total bet 12), seat4 call 10 (since they already posted SB 2, they need 10 more to call 12). So pot = SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 12 + call 10 = 28. Yes.\n\nWe need to act: amount to call 8 (to match 12). Minimum raise to 20 (i.e., raise total to 20). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Hand 9s7s is a speculative hand. In BB vs raise from DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat3). Need to consider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2's raise sizes: past raises varied from 8 to 100, often 12, 16, etc. Could be wide? Let's check more: we have raise amounts: 10,8,12,16,100. That's a range. Could be aggressive, maybe open-raising wide. Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) just called the raise (post SB). So they are likely a caller.\n\nOur stack is deep (66 BB). 9s7s suited can be played in multi-way pots, but we are out of position in BB against a raise and a caller. The implied odds are limited, but we could consider a call to see flop cheap (8). Pot odds: pot 28, call 8 => pot will be 36 after call, we invest 8 to win 36 => 8/36 = 22% needed. Hand equity vs typical range? If DeepSeek raises wide maybe 2-3bb? Actually raise 12 is 3x BB. In 2-4 game, raise to 12 is 3BB. That's standard. Range could be about 15-20% of hands. Adding MiniMax call adds more players, making equity lower. 9s7s equity vs typical 15% range maybe around 15%? Might be borderline. But we have deep stack, could call for set mining? 9s7s can make straight draws and flush draws. Could be okay to call.\n\nAlternatively could raise to isolate, but raising 20 total (i.e., 20) would be 5BB total. That would be a 5BB raise. Might isolate MiniMax but also risk being 3-bet. Our hand is not strong enough to 3-bet for value, but could be a semi-bluff. But given we are deep and have position disadvantage, likely better to call and see flop.\n\nThus choose call.\n\nReasoning: decent suited connectors, good implied odds, pot odds favorable, opponent likely raising wide, caller present, deep stacks, call cheap.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

So we have a flush draw? Need 5 spades total, we have 2 spades, board has 1 spade, need 2 more spades on turn/river, that's a backdoor flush draw (2 outs? Actually need two spades among remaining cards). Also we have open-ended straight draw? 9-7 with board 6, need 8 to make 7-8-9, but need also 5 or 10? Actually straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9 (need 5 and 8) or 6-7-8-9-10 (need 8 and 10). So not immediate.\n\nWe have 9-7, not strong. Opponent (Seat 3, DeepSeek-V3.2) raised preflop to 12 from UTG? Actually seat 3 is maybe UTG? Not given. He raised 12, we called, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called as well. So three players in flop: Seat3 (DeepSeek) bet 20 into pot 76. So pot after bet: 76 + 20 = 96? Actually before bet pot 76 includes blinds and preflop calls. Then DeepSeek bets 20, seat4 calls 20, now we need to act. So pot currently 76+20+20 = 116? Wait seat4 hasn't acted yet? Actually flop actions: seat4 check, seat5 check, seat3 bet 20, seat4 call 20. So after seat4 call, pot = 76 + 20 (bet) + 20 (call) = 116. Now we face 20 bet.\n\nOur hand is weak. Opponent likely continuation bet with Qx, maybe a 6 pair, maybe a set? Actually board has pair of 6s; possible that DeepSeek has a 6, making trips, or a queen, top pair. Could also be a bluff.\n\nWe have 64 BB stack, 256 chips, so deep. Should we fold? Likely fold. Let's consider any reason to call: we have backdoor flush draw and straight draws, but odds: we need 2 spades out of remaining 45 cards (assuming unknown). That's about 2/45 ~4.4% per turn, then need another on river if missed turn. Combined probability maybe ~8-10% to make flush. Straight draws need two specific cards (5 and 8, or 8 and 10). That's 4 outs (5,8,10 maybe duplicates). Actually outs: 5,8,10. For 5-6-7-8-9 need 5 and 8 (2 cards). For 6-7-8-9-10 need 8 and 10 (2 cards). Overlap 8 appears in both combos, so outs: 5,8,10 = 3 distinct ranks, each 4 suits = 12 outs, but some may be blocked by known cards: board has Qd,6c,6s; our hand 9s,7s. So spades: we have 9s,7s, board 6s. So remaining spades: A,K,J,10,8,5,4,3,2 of spades = 9 spades. For straight outs: 5s,5c,5h,5d (4); 8s,8c,8h,8d (4); 10s,10c,10h,10d (4) but some may be already accounted: we have 9s,7s, board 6s. So 5s,8s,10s are spades; those are also flush outs. So total outs maybe 12 distinct cards (some overlap). So about 12 outs. Probability to hit on turn or river ~ 12/45 + (33/45)*(12/44) \u2248 0.267 + 0.75*0.273 = 0.267+0.205=0.472. Actually that's 47% to improve to a decent hand (pair or better). But we need to consider that if we hit a pair (like 9 or 7) that would be low pair, not strong.

Then SB posted 2 (makes pot 12), BB posted 4 (makes pot 14), seat4 call 4 (makes pot 18). Actually the actions list: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 2, Seat1 post_bb 4, Seat3 fold, Seat4 call 4. So seat4 called the big blind (4) meaning they put 4 chips. So total chips in pot: 2+4+4 =10? Wait the blinds themselves are 2 and 4, which are part of pot 10 initially. Then seat5 posted sb 2 (that's already included?), Actually blinds are posted before hand, pot is 6 (2+4). But they say pot: 10 chips. Might include some antes? Not needed. Anyway amount to call: 2 (we need to call the BB's 4? Actually we are SB, we posted 2, the BB posted 4, seat4 called 4, so we need to call 2 more to match the 4? Yes amount to call is 2. Minimum raise to 8.\n\nGiven hand 8h3s is very weak, likely fold. Consider tournament stage? Stack 63.5 BB, still decent. Opponent tendencies unknown. But we can check opponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) stack 27 chips, short stack. Might be trying to steal? But we are SB, out of position, hand is terrible. So fold.\n\nThus JSON: action fold, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Consider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2's preflop raises amounts vary: 5,10,12,10,8,12,16,100,12. That suggests they raise sometimes bigger, maybe they are aggressive. But they are BB; they haven't raised yet, they just posted blind. So we are facing a call of 4. Our hand is weak, not a good candidate to steal.

Hand is weak, but we have a short stack opponent with 35 chips, about 8.75 BB. We could consider a raise to try to steal, but 4-5 suited is not great for a steal. However SB is very short; he may fold to raise. Raising to 8 (minimum) would be a 4 total raise (to 8 total). Actually minimum raise to is 8 (so total bet 8). That would be 4 more chips from us (since we already have 4 in pot). That would be 2 BB raise. That's small. Could we go all-in? Not needed. Likely we should just check and see flop cheap, because we have low stack but also low equity. However we could also try to isolate and maybe get a chance to win small pot. But 4-5 suited can make straights and flushes. With SB's stack 35, he could be willing to call a raise for cheap. But we have 250, not short.\n\nGiven we are BB with 62 BB, we can afford to check and see flop. So best action: check.\n\nThus output JSON.",

Actually seat1 posted SB 2, seat5 posted BB 4. So SB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 294 chips. So they are the only other active player. Preflop action: SB posted 2 (small blind), BB posted 4 (big blind). No raise, so we are facing a call of 2 to complete the blind. So amount to call = 2 (to call SB's 2). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total, meaning raise by 4). We have 9d7s, a marginal hand. In BB vs SB, typical strategy: with 9-7 offsuit, it's a weak hand. Since we are out of position postflop (SB will act first), we should likely fold unless we have some reason to call (like defend blind). But 9d7s is not a good hand to defend. However stack depth is 62 BB, but still not worth risking blind with such weak hand.\n\nWe could consider calling to see flop cheap, but we are out of position and hand is weak. The pot odds: pot currently 6 (SB 2 + BB 4). To call 2 more, we get 6+2=8 pot? Actually after call, pot would be 8 (2+4+2). So we invest 2 to win 8, pot odds 4:1. Hand equity needed ~20% to break even. 9d7s vs random? Roughly 12% preflop vs random. So not profitable. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

It's preflop, amount to call 0 (since we are BB and already posted). Options: check or raise. Hand 9d5h is weak, unsuited, low. Should we just check and hope to see flop cheap? In BB, with such weak hand, likely fold to raise. Check is fine. However consider opponent's stack: MiniMax-M2 has 78 chips (9.75 BB). They are short stacked. They just called SB, likely will be aggressive or maybe shove later. We could check and maybe see flop, but we risk being out of position vs short stack who may shove later.

MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) called the BB for 8, so there are three players in the pot: SB 4 (maybe hasn't acted? Actually SB posted 4, but hasn't acted yet? In preflop order: SB posts, BB posts, then action starts with UTG (seat1?) Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, but seat1 posted SB. So seat1 is SB. Then seat3 is BB. Then seat4 is MiniMax-M2, who called 8. Now it's button (us) to act, amount to call 8. So we have a pot of 20 (SB 4 + BB 8 + call 8 = 20). We can fold, call, raise to at least 16 (minimum raise total). Our stack 264, so raise possible.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 seems to call small amounts often, sometimes folds, sometimes bets small. Not much aggression. DeepSeek-V3.2 unknown. SB Kimi-K2 Thinking unknown.\n\nPocket eights is a medium pair, about 10% equity vs random. In multi-way, likely not great. But we are in position (button) and can see flop. Could call to see flop. Raise could isolate but we risk being 3-betted? Actually there is no raise yet, just call. If we raise to 16 (total) that's a 8 raise over call? Actually min raise is 16 total, which is 8 more than call (call 8). So raise to 16 would be a raise of 8 more, making pot 28 (plus 8 from us). That would isolate against MiniMax maybe, but SB and BB could also call.\n\nGiven our hand, maybe best to call and see flop. Pot odds: call 8 to win 20+8=28? Actually if we call, pot becomes 28 (20+8). Equity needed ~28% to be break even. Pocket eights vs 2 random opponents ~ maybe 30%? Might be borderline. But we have position, can fold later.\n\nRaising could get folds from SB and BB (they have already posted blinds, they could fold). MiniMax may fold as well. Might isolate to heads-up vs BB (DeepSeek). BB unknown but could be tight. If we raise, we risk being re-raised? No further raises possible preflop? Actually after us, action goes to SB then BB. So they could call or raise. If they raise, we could fold.\n\nGiven we have decent stack and want to accumulate chips, maybe raise to isolate BB? But BB posted blind, might defend wide.\n\nI think best is to call, see flop.\n\nThus action: call.\n\n",

Calling gives us good pot odds (12 to call for a ~64 chip pot, ~19% equity needed) and lets us see a flop to hit a set, which could win a large pot against both opponents. Raising would not isolate effectively with only a minimal increase and could commit more chips without clear advantage.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have pocket eights on BTN, 32 BB stack, facing a raise from DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) after small blind and big blind posted and MiniMax called, then we called, then SB folded, then DeepSeek raised to 20 (so from 8 to 20, a raise of 12). Now MiniMax (seat 4) called 12 to 20. So we are facing a 12 call to 20 raise, amount to call is 12 (to match 20). Minimum raise to 32 (so raise at least to 32 total). Our stack is 256, we can raise.\n\nWe need to decide: pocket eights is a decent hand, but in early position (DeepSeek) raised, and a short stack (MiniMax) called. MiniMax is 58 chips (7.25 BB). So MiniMax likely will be all-in or call with any pair. They already called 12 (so they are now at 20 total, have 38 left). They could be all-in later. DeepSeek's raise size is small (2.5 BB). This is a typical open-raise from UTG? Not sure position. But they raised to 20 (2.5 BB) which is small, maybe a wide range.\n\nWe have 8-8, a medium pocket pair. With 32 BB, we could consider 3-betting to isolate and build pot. However, deep stack is 344 chips (42.9 BB). MiniMax is short 58 chips. If we 3-bet, we may isolate MiniMax (who already called) and DeepSeek. But we could also just call and see flop.\n\nGiven pocket pair, we could 3-bet to maybe 80-100 to isolate. But we have 32 BB, raising to 32 (minimum) would be a 12 raise (to total 32). That's 12 more chips (so we put total 32). That would be a 2.5x raise (from 20 to 32). That's not much; could be considered a re-raise (3-bet) but small.\n\nWe could also go all-in (256) but that's too large.\n\nWhat about opponent tendencies: DeepSeek raises vary from 5 to 100. They have raised 72 in hand 42, also 100 in hand 27. So they sometimes raise big, but also small. Not enough data.\n\nMiniMax is short stack; they called. Likely they have decent hand (maybe pair). With 8-8, we have good equity vs overpairs (like AA, KK) not great, but vs lower pairs we are ahead.\n\nGiven tournament, preserving stack is important. 8-8 is a good hand to call and see flop. But raising could isolate and possibly win bigger pot if we hit set.\n\nConsider pot odds: pot is 52, plus 12 call to call = 64 total after call. If we call, we invest 12 to potentially win 64 (pot after call). That's 12/64 = 18.75% required equity, we have > 20% (approx 20% vs random). So call is fine.\n\nBut also there is a short stack, which could go all-in later. If we call and get set, we can get big chips.\n\nThus I think best is to call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Choose call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So we have middle pair, not overpair (overpair would be higher than board, but board highest is 6). Pair of 8 is top pair? Yes highest pair on board is 8 vs 6,4,3. So we have top pair, decent. Opponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) is in BB, they raised preflop to 20 (from 8) then we called. So they are likely 3-bett? Actually they raised after our call? Let's parse: Preflop actions: SB posted 4 (seat1). BB posted 8 (seat3). Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) call 8 (small blind? Actually seat4 is MP? He is in early position? Not important). Seat5 (us) call 8. Then seat1 fold. Then seat3 raise 20 (so BB raises to 20 after the initial call? Actually seat3 posted 8 blind, then after call they raise to 20). So they raise. Seat4 call 12 (so they call the raise, adding 12 more). Seat5 call 12 (we call). So preflop we called a raise from BB, so we are in a pot with two opponents: seat3 (BB) and seat4 (MiniMax-M2). On flop, seat3 checks, seat4 bets 30 into pot of 94 (so pot after bet is 124). Seat4 is short stack 28 chips total, but they bet 30? Wait seat4 stack is 28 chips before action? Actually seat4 stack is 28 chips, but they bet 30? That seems impossible; maybe they are all-in for 28? But they bet 30, maybe they have more chips? The description says seat4: 28 chips. So they cannot bet 30, maybe they are all-in for 28, but bet shown as 30? Could be rounding. Might be they are short stacked and go all-in for 28, which is less than the minimum raise of 60, but they are allowed to go all-in. So seat4 is effectively all-in for 28 (or 30). The pot before bet: 94. If they are all-in for 28, the total pot becomes 94+28=122. The amount to call is 30 (they bet 30). We have to decide call, fold, or raise.\n\nOur hand: 8-8, top pair, decent kicker (8's). Board is 3-6-4, possible straight draws? Board has 3-4-6, possible draws 5-7? Actually a straight would be 2-5-7? Let's see combos: Straight possibilities: 2-5-7? Not contiguous. For a straight, need 5-7-8? Board 3-4-6, you need 2-5-7-8? Not immediate. The board is low, no flush possibilities (two spades). We have no spade. Opponent could have 5-7 for open-ended straight draw? Actually 5-7 would give straight 3-4-5-6-7 (needs 5 and 7). So they could have 5-7 combos. Also 2-5 would give 2-3-4-5-6 straight. So there are straight draws. Opponent could have A2 for wheel? Not relevant.\n\nSeat4 is short stack, likely shoving all-in. They bet 30 (all-in). We need to decide if we call. Our stack 244 chips, so we can call 30. Pot odds: we need to call 30 to win pot of about 122 (if we call). So equity needed = 30/(30+122) = 30/152 \u2248 19.7%. So we need about 20% equity. Our hand vs opponent's range: Opponent is short stack, likely shoving with any pair, maybe any Ace, maybe draws. Our pair of eights is decent. Against a random hand, we have >50% equity. Against a range of possible hands: Could be any pair, any Ace, any straight draw, maybe some two overcards. Likely we are ahead of many.\n\nWe also have seat3 still in hand, they checked. So we have two opponents: seat3 could call seat4's all-in? Actually seat4's bet is all-in; seat3 can call or fold. But we need to act now. If we call, we will be in a multi-way pot (maybe). If seat3 folds, we will be"

No flush draw currently (two spades on board, we have none). Straight draw? Board 3-4-6, we have 8,8. No open-ended. So we have a decent hand, top pair (actually overpair). Opponents: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) is the BB who raised preflop to 20 (from 8). So they raised 20 (maybe 2.5x BB). Then seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 12 (so they are in big blind? Actually seat 4 is out). Wait seat 4 had 0 chips (out). But they are listed as having 0 chips (out). However they are still in actions? In preflop they posted sb 4 (seat1) and bb 8 (seat3). Seat4 call 8? But seat4 has 0 chips (out) weird. Possibly seat4 is a placeholder for a player that folded preflop? Actually they call 8 preflop, then after raise, they call 12. So they are still in. So seat4 is a player with 0 chips? Might be a mistake. Anyway seat4 is the one who bet 30 on flop, then called 28 after raise. So seat4 is the original small blind? Actually seat1 is SB, seat3 is BB, seat4 is maybe UTG? Not sure. But seat4 bet 30 on flop, then call 28 after raise. So seat4 is the initial bettor, likely a short stack (0 chips?) but they bet 30, meaning they have chips. Anyway we have to decide.\n\nCurrent pot: 242 pre-flop? Actually pot after flop actions: preflop pot: blinds 4+8=12, plus seat4 call 8, seat5 call 8, seat3 raise 20, seat4 call 12, seat5 call 12 => total? Let's compute: initial blinds 4+8=12. Then seat4 call 8 adds 8 => 20. Seat5 call 8 adds 8 => 28. Seat3 raise 20 adds 20 (makes his total 20? Actually raise to 20 means he adds 12 more? Not important). Then seat4 call 12 adds 12 => 40. Seat5 call 12 adds 12 => 52. So preflop pot maybe 12+8+8+20+12+12 = 72? But the given pot is 242, maybe includes some previous? Anyway.\n\nFlop actions: seat3 check, seat4 bet 30 (so pot becomes 272). Seat5 call 30 (adds 30). Seat3 raise 90 (so adds 60 more beyond call? Actually to raise to 90 total, need to put 90-30=60). Seat4 call 28 (so they call the additional 60? Actually they call 28, meaning they put 28 more to match 90? Wait they had already contributed 30, so to call 90 they need 60 more, but they call 28? Something off. But given amount to call is 60, meaning we need to call 60 to match seat3's raise. Minimum raise to 150. So we have to decide.\n\nSeat3 (DeepSeek) raised to 90 on flop after seat4's bet. So seat3 is likely representing a strong hand or a draw. Seat4 is a short stack? They bet 30, then called 28 after raise, meaning they are now all-in? Not sure.\n\nOur hand overpair is strong but vulnerable to sets (3,6,4). No set on board currently. Potential draws: seat3 could have a straight draw like 5-7 (open-ended) or 2-5 (gutshot) or a flush draw (spades). They have no spades, but board has two spades; they could have two spades for flush draw. They could also have a pair like 6 or 4 or 3, but they'd likely just call. They raised, indicating strength or draw.\n\nWe have 214 chips, stack 26.8 BB. The pot now is 242 + 30 + 30 + 90? Actually after seat3 raise, pot maybe around 242+30+30+90 = 392? The amount to call is 60, so if we call we invest 60, making pot ~452. Pot odds: 60 to win ~452 => 13% required. Our hand likely best vs many draws, but we risk"

Straight draws: board 3-4-5-6 gives straight draw: 2-7 would complete straight. Our 8s does not help. We have middle pair, not great. Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) is the only opponent left (Seat 3). Also Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 0 chips? Actually seat 4 is out? It says 0 chips (out). But actions show seat 4 called flop and then called raise. But they have 0 chips? Probably they are still in with some chips? But stack not listed. Probably seat 4 is still in but with unknown stack. However after flop, seat 4 called raise 28 (call of 90 raise?). Wait flop actions: Seat 3 check, Seat 4 bet 30, Seat5 call, Seat3 raise 90 (so to 120 total? Actually raise 90 likely means raise to 90? But min raise 60). Then seat4 call 28 (so they call additional 28 to match raise). Seat5 call 60 (so they call additional 60). So after flop, pot: initial pot 302 + flop bet 30+call30+raise? Let's compute: Preflop pot: 4+8+8+8+... Actually preflop: blinds 4+8, seat4 call 8, seat5 call 8, seat3 raise to 20 (so add 12 more), seat4 call 12 (so add 4?), seat5 call 12 (add 4). So pot after preflop: 4+8+8+8 + (20-8)?? Let's not needed.\n\nNow on turn, seat3 (DeepSeek) checks. Amount to call 0. Minimum raise 60. We have 154 chips. So we could check or raise. Need to consider opponent tendencies. We have no data on DeepSeek's raise patterns on flop (they raised after a bet). Actually they raised on flop after seat4 bet 30. So they are aggressive. On turn board is 5d added (makes board 3-4-5-6-5?). Actually board now 3h 6s 4s 5d (no pair). Turn card is 5d, so now board has a pair of 5s. We have 8s, still middle pair. Opponent might have 5x for trips, or a straight draw (2 or 7). They could have a hand like 7-8 for straight? Actually board 3-4-5-6, a 7 would give straight 3-4-5-6-7. So 7 is straight. Also a 2 gives 2-3-4-5-6 straight. So opponent could have 7x or 2x. Also could have 5x for trips. Also could have a set? No set possible because no pair on board earlier. Could have 6x for trips? Board has 6s, so if they have 6? Only one 6 on board, they could have 6? That would be two pair (6s and maybe something else). Actually board now 3,4,5,6,5. So they could have 5 for trips. Or 6 for two pair (6 with something else). Or 8 for two pair (8 with board? No 8 not on board). So likely they have a draw or a made hand.\n\nOur pocket 8s is not great.

          "content": "We need to decide action on river. Let's analyze.\n\nWe have pocket eights (8h 8c). Board: 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So board shows a pair of 4s (two 4s: 4s and 4d). Also straight possibilities: board is 3-4-5-6, missing 2 or 7 for straight. Our hand 8s? No 8 doesn't help. No flush (two spades, two diamonds, one heart). So our eights are just a pair, second pair to the board's pair? Actually board has pair of 4s, we have a pair of 8s, so we have two pair (8s and 4s). That's decent but board also has potential for straight draws that might have completed: if opponent had 2-7, they could have straight on river? Let's see: board after turn: 3h 6s 4s 5d (turn unknown? Actually board: 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d, so turn was 4d? Wait board shows 5 cards: 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So turn card is 5d? No order: flop: 3h 6s 4s. Turn: 5d. River: 4d. So river paired the board with another 4. So final board: 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So there are three 4s? Actually there are two 4s: 4s on flop, 4d on river. So pair of 4s. No three of a kind. So we have two pair: 8s and 4s.\n\nPotential opponent hands: Could have a straight: 2-7? Board after turn: 3-4-5-6. If opponent had 2-7, they'd have a straight on the turn (2-3-4-5-6) or (3-4-5-6-7) depending. After river, the 4d gives board a pair, but straight still exists if they have 2-7? Actually if they have 2-7, they have 2-3-4-5-6 (a 6-high straight) using 2 and board 3-4-5-6. That's still a straight; river 4d doesn't affect. Or 7-8? 7-8 would give 4-5-6-7-8 straight using 7 and 8? But we have 8s but opponent could have 7-? Actually board has 3,4,5,6,4. For a straight, need 2-6 or 3-7. 7-8 would need 4-5-6-7-8, but board only has 4-5-6, missing 7. So need 7 in hand and 8? Wait 8 is not on board. So 7-8 would give 4-5-6-7-8 using 7 and 8, but board has 4-5-6, yes that makes straight 4-5-6-7-8. So opponent could have 7-8 (any suits). That would be a straight, beating our two pair. Also opponent could have 2-? 2-? Actually 2-? with 2 and something else? For straight 2-3-4-5-6 need 2 and something else (like 2 and any other). So 2-? any card not making higher straight. So opponent could have 2-? (like 2-9) and have straight 2-3-4-5-6.\n\nAlso they could have a full house? Board has pair of 4s.

That's better than two pair.\n\nCould have a set of 3s? No board only one 3. So set not possible.\n\nCould have a flush? No three of same suit.\n\nSo opponent's range: They raised preflop from BB (Seat 3) to 20, called by others, then on flop they checked, then bet 30 (Seat 4? Actually flop: Seat 3 check, Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 call 30, Seat 3 raise 90, Seat 4 call 28, Seat 5 call 60). Wait seat 4 is out? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2 with 0 chips (out). But"

Also straight possibilities: board is 3-4-5-6, missing 2 or 7 for straight. Our hand 8s? No 8 doesn't help. No flush (two spades, two diamonds, one heart). So our eights are just a pair, second pair to the board's pair? Actually board has pair of 4s, we have a pair of 8s, so we have two pair (8s and 4s). That's decent but board also has potential for straight draws that might have completed: if opponent had 2-7, they could have straight on river? Let's see: board after turn: 3h 6s 4s 5d (turn unknown? Actually board: 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d, so turn was 4d? Wait board shows 5 cards: 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So turn card is 5d? No order: flop: 3h 6s 4s. Turn: 5d. River: 4d. So river paired the board with another 4. So final board: 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So there are three 4s? Actually there are two 4s: 4s on flop, 4d on river. So pair of 4s. No three of a kind. So we have two pair: 8s and 4s.\n\nPotential opponent hands: Could have a straight: 2-7? Board after turn: 3-4-5-6. If opponent had 2-7, they'd have a straight on the turn (2-3-4-5-6) or (3-4-5-6-7) depending. After river, the 4d gives board a pair, but straight still exists if they have 2-7? Actually if they have 2-7, they have 2-3-4-5-6 (a 6-high straight) using 2 and board 3-4-5-6. That's still a straight; river 4d doesn't affect. Or 7-8? 7-8 would give 4-5-6-7-8 straight using 7 and 8? But we have 8s but opponent could have 7-? Actually board has 3,4,5,6,4. For a straight, need 2-6 or 3-7. 7-8 would need 4-5-6-7-8, but board only has 4-5-6, missing 7. So need 7 in hand and 8? Wait 8 is not on board. So 7-8 would give 4-5-6-7-8 using 7 and 8, but board has 4-5-6, yes that makes straight 4-5-6-7-8. So opponent could have 7-8 (any suits). That would be a straight, beating our two pair. Also opponent could have 2-? 2-? Actually 2-? with 2 and something else? For straight 2-3-4-5-6 need 2 and something else (like 2 and any other). So 2-? any card not making higher straight. So opponent could have 2-? (like 2-9) and have straight 2-3-4-5-6.\n\nAlso they could have a full house? Board has pair of 4s. If opponent holds a 4, they'd have trips (three 4s) or full house if they also have a pair in hand? Not possible. They could have 4x making three of a kind (4s). That's better than two pair.\n\nCould have a set of 3s? No board only one 3. So set not possible.\n\nCould have a flush? No three of same suit.\n\nSo opponent's range: They raised preflop from BB (Seat 3) to 20, called by others, then on flop they checked, then bet 30 (Seat 4? Actually flop: Seat 3 check, Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 call 30, Seat 3 raise 90, Seat 4 call 28, Seat 5 call 60). Wait seat 4 is out? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2 with 0 chips (out). But",

They posted SB 4, then called 4 (so they just called). So preflop we are in BB, opponent just called SB. No raise yet. We can check or raise. Hand 7T unsuited. In BB vs a caller from SB, typical strategy: 7T is a decent hand for a raise in early position? But we are in BB, can raise to 16 min (i.e., 8 more). Our stack 222, deep enough. Consider opponent tendencies: from recall, MiniMax has raised small amounts (4,8) and also a big raise (48) and 28. They seem to raise sometimes but also call. Not enough data. In this hand they just called. So they may be passive. 7T suited? No, unsuited. Hand is moderate, can raise to isolate and take pot. In tournament early stage, stack 27.8 BB, we can be aggressive. Raise to 24 maybe? Minimum raise is 16 (total). Could raise to 24 (i.e., 8 more). Might be fine.\n\nCheck is also possible to see flop cheap. But 7T has some equity vs random. Raising may get folds and win blinds. I'd raise to 24 (total) to apply pressure. Reason: isolate, build pot with decent hand.\n\nThus action: raise 24.\n\n",

Actually seat5 is SB. Seat1 is BB? Wait seat numbers: seat5 is SB (us). seat1 posted SB 4, seat1 also posted BB 8? Actually line: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4, Seat1 post_bb 8. So seat1 is BB.

So we are facing a raise? Actually amount to call is 8 (big blind). That means no raise yet; we can call 8 (i.e., just match big blind) or raise min to 16 (total). So it's a standard open-raise scenario: we are on button, we have QJ offsuit (Jd Qs). Hand strength moderate. Should we raise? Consider opponent tendencies: we have recall of Kimi-K2 Thinking raise amounts: they have raised 6 (which is 1.5 BB?), 28, 12, 12, 24. Those are preflop raises from SB? The amounts likely total amount they raised to? Not sure. In this hand, the SB posted 4, so a raise of 12 would be total 12? Actually min raise is 16 total (i.e., 8 to call + 8 raise). So typical raise size maybe 2.5 BB (20) or 3 BB (24). The opponent seems to raise various amounts, sometimes 12 (which is 1.5 BB? Actually 12 total includes blind? Not sure). But they have raised 12 twice, 24 once, 28 once, 6 once. So they sometimes do small raises, sometimes larger.\n\nWe have decent hand for button, could open raise to steal blinds. Stack depth 29 BB, we can afford raise. Considering tournament, we want to accumulate chips; QJ offsuit is decent but not premium; but on button, can raise to apply pressure. Opponent SB may call or 3-bet? Their stack 248 chips (approx 31 BB). They may be tight? Not enough info.\n\nGiven we are on button with 29 BB, we can raise to 24 (3 BB) to apply pressure. That seems standard.\n\nThus action: raise to 24. Reasoning: position, hand decent, steal blinds, opponent likely folds to raise.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Action: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, SB folded, we (BTN) raise to 24 (so raise 24 total? Actually raise amount: we posted 24 total, which is 3x big blind). Then BB (DeepSeek-V3.2) raises to 64 (so re-raise). Amount to call is 40 (to match 64). Minimum raise to 104 (i.e., raise at least to 104 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide.\n\nOur hand Jd Qs off-suit, in BTN. Against BB who just 3-bet to 64 (which is 8 BB). Our stack is 210, we have 210-24=186 left after our raise. To call we need 40 chips, leaving ~146 after call. To 3-bet further would be raising to at least 104 total (i.e., additional 40). So a 4-bet would be 104 total, which is 40 more than current 64, meaning we would need to add 40 chips (total put in 104). That's about 5.2 BB. So 4-bet size relative to 3-bet is 104/64 = 1.625 times, which is about 1.6x the 3-bet, typical 4-bet size maybe 2.5-3x the 3-bet for deep stacks. But we have a short stack (26 BB). JQ offsuit is not a strong 4-bet candidate; it's a marginal hand, maybe a call or fold depending on opponent's tendencies.\n\nWe need to recall opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 has raised various amounts preflop: small raises (5-12) and some larger (100, 72, 28). So they sometimes 3-bet large (100) maybe when they have strong hands. In this situation, they 3-bet to 64 after our 24 raise. That's a 2.66x raise (64/24). That's a standard 3-bet size for a short stack (maybe 3x). Could be strong or semi-bluff.\n\nOur hand JQ offsuit is a decent hand for a call in position against a short stack, but also could be a fold if we think they only 3-bet strong. Considering we have 26 BB, we could call and see flop, but we risk being dominated by AK, AQ, KQ, etc. JQ suited would be better, but off-suit is weaker.\n\nPot odds: To call 40 into pot 92+40 (current pot after raise?) Actually pot before call includes our 24 raise and BB's 64 raise? Let's compute: initial pot 4+8=12. We raise to 24 (so we add 24, but we already posted SB 4? Actually we are BTN, not SB, we raise 24 total, meaning we put 24 chips. So pot after our raise: 12 + 24 = 36? Wait we need to be careful: The pot before any action: SB 4, BB 8 = 12. Then we raise to 24, meaning we put 24 chips (we didn't have any blind). So pot becomes 12+24=36. Then BB re-raises to 64, adding extra 56 (since they already had 8). So pot becomes 36+56=92. That's the pot shown: 92 chips. Yes.\n\nNow amount to call is 40 (to match 64). If we call, the total pot after call will be 92+40=132. So pot odds: need to call 40 to win 132, i.e., 30% equity needed. JQ offsuit vs unknown range: if opponent's 3-bet range is maybe 10% of hands (including strong combos). JQ off-suit is likely bottom of that range, maybe 1% equity? Actually JQ off-suit vs typical 3-bet range (like TT+, AK, AQ, maybe some suited connectors) is around 20%? Let's approximate: vs TT+, AK, AQ, maybe also AJs, KQs, maybe some suited connectors. JQ offsuit likely around 15% equity. That's below required 30%, so not a good call.\n\nThus folding is advisable.\n\nBut also consider stack preservation: we have 26 BB, need to preserve chips. Folding loses 24 chips (our raise) but we already invested that; we can fold now and preserve stack. If we call, we risk being in a big pot out of position.\n\nThus"

In BTN, standard opening range includes Q9s. With 24.8 BB, we can raise to maybe 2.5x BB (20) or 3x (24). Since minimum raise is 16, raising to 20-24 is fine.

So we are in SB with 7hTs, amount to call 4 (to match the BB's 8? Actually SB posted 4 already, BB posted 8, MiniMax called 8, so the pot is 4+8+8=20, we have to call 4 to match 8).

The opponent MiniMax just called preflop, likely a decent hand but unknown. 7Ts is a marginal hand; in SB we are out of position postflop. With 24 BB stack, we could consider raising to isolate, but raise to 16 min raise (total). That would be a raise to 16 total (i.e., additional 12). Is that advisable? 7Ts is not a strong hand to raise from SB, especially against a player who just called (maybe a wide range). Raising could isolate but also commit more chips. Could also just call and see flop out of position. The pot odds: we need to call 4 to see flop, pot is 20, effective pot after call 24, pot odds ~ 4/24 = 16.7% required. Hand equity vs unknown range? 7Ts vs a calling range (maybe 8-? Actually MiniMax called from MP maybe with broad range). 7Ts suited? It's offsuit hearts. So equity maybe around 30% vs random.

That's a small raise. Could be used as a semi-bluff. Opponent tendencies unknown; recall shows no raises on flop for Kimi-K2 Thinking. No data. Likely they are tight? Not sure.\n\nWe are short stack? 24 BB, not extremely short. In tournament early stage, preserve chips. Hand is weak, not a good candidate to raise unless we think they will fold. Since they checked preflop, maybe they have a weak hand. But board is Ace high, they could have Ace, Q, etc. Raising could be risky but small raise maybe fine. But if they have Ace they may call. If they have Q they may call. If they have nothing, they may fold.\n\nGiven limited info, safest is check. So action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Our stack 190, call 102 would leave 88 chips left. That's about 5.5 BB. That is a very short stack; maybe we want to go all-in? But cannot raise. Call would be effectively going all-in? Actually call 102 leaves 88, not all-in. So we would be short stacked after call. Is that okay? Could consider folding to preserve stack, but maybe we can call to see flop with suited connector and hope to double up. However 6c7d is not premium; against unknown opponent raise (maybe deep). Our stack is short, we could also consider folding to preserve chips for better spots. In tournament with 190 chips, 11.9 BB, we are short. If we fold, we have 190 still. If we call, we will be at 88 chips. If we lose, we are out. The raise size is large (118) relative to blinds (8/16). That's 7.4 BB raise. That suggests opponent is strong.

          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 6h5s, small stack 182 chips (11.4 BB). Effective stacks are low, 11 BB. Hand is weak but can be suited connector, could flop straight/flush. In BB, we already posted 16. Opponent seat1 posted SB 8. So we are out of position vs SB. Opponent SB has 412 chips, larger stack.\n\nWe face a raise? Actually actions: seat5 post_sb 8 (that's SB posting 8?), Wait seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Actually blinds: 8/16, seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB. So seat5 posted SB 8? That seems reversed. But given \"preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 8\" indicates seat5 posted small blind, but seat5 is BB seat? Might be seat ordering weird. But they say \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So seat5 is BB, but they posted SB 8? Might be a mistake. Then seat1 posted BB 16. So seat5 is SB? Actually seat5 is BB but posted SB? Anyway, amount to call is 8, meaning we need to call 8 to match BB? Likely SB posted 8, BB posted 16, and now we need to call 8 more? Actually if we are BB, we have already posted 16, so amount to call would be 0. But they say amount to call: 8. So maybe seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB? But they say Position: BB. Something off. However legal actions: fold, call, raise. So we have to decide.\n\nGiven hand 6h5s, with 11 BB effective, we could consider a raise (steal) but it's weak. SB raise to 32 min raise, but we are the BB? Actually min raise to 32. So we could raise to 32 (total). That would be a 16 raise (since we already have 16). But we have only 182 chips, still fine.\n\nBut typical strategy: With 6-5 suited, you could limp or call the blind? In 11 BB stack, you might want to see a cheap flop. The SB is short stack? Actually SB has 412 chips, larger. So calling 8 to see flop is cheap. However being out of position post-flop is disadvantage. But hand has potential.\n\nGiven tournament, preserve chips, but also need to accumulate. 6-5 suited is marginal. I think best to call (just see flop) rather than raise and risk. So action: call 8.\n\nCheck legal: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Consider opponent: BB is DeepSeek-V3.2 with 126 chips, somewhat short stack. Might be willing to shove. But we are BTN, can raise to isolate. Pocket fours have low equity vs many hands, but can be good against overpairs? Not great. With 10.9 BB, typical push/fold range includes all pairs? In tournament early stage, with 10 BB, push/fold is common. But we have 174 chips, could push all-in (raise to 174). Minimum raise is 32, but we could go all-in. Should we? Pocket fours are not premium; risk of being dominated. However, opponent short stack may shove anyway; calling might be okay. Since we have 10 BB, many players push all-in.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #66 turn. Our hand: 8h Qs. Board: Kd 3d Ad Ts. So board shows K, A, T, 3, all diamonds except Kd, 3d, Ad are diamonds, Ts is spade. Actually board: Kd (diamond), 3d (diamond), Ad (diamond), Ts (spade). So three diamonds on board: Kd, 3d, Ad. Our hand: 8h Qs. No diamond, so we have no flush draw (we have 0 diamonds). Straight possibilities: board has A K T 3. Potential straight draws? With Q we have A K Q T = Broadway straight (A K Q J T) missing J. We have Q, but need J. No J. Also we have 8, not relevant. So we have a gutshot straight draw: need J for straight. Also we have pair of Q? No board Q, so we have overpair to board? Actually board has K, A, T. Our Q is lower than K and A, but higher than T? Q is between K and J? Actually rank order: A K Q J T. So Q is third highest. We have top pair? No board doesn't have Q, so we have a pair of Qs (we have Qs). That's a pair, but board has higher cards A and K, so we have a \"pair, but likely behind\". So hand strength moderate: pair of Qs, plus gutshot straight draw to A K Q J T. Also potential backdoor flush? No diamonds in hand, board has 3 diamonds, we have no diamond, so no flush draw.\n\nOpponent: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has checked on turn. So pot 32. No bet. We can check or raise. What are opponent tendencies? From recall, we see that MiniMax-M2 sometimes checks on turn, sometimes bets small (4), sometimes bets larger (20). They have called raises etc. Hard to infer.\n\nOur stack 300, pot 32. Minimum raise 16. So raise to 16 (i.e., raise 16 total). That would be a raise of 16 (since call is 0). Actually raise_to = total amount we put in, so raise to 16 means we bet 16.\n\nWe need to decide: check or raise? Consider: we have a decent hand (pair of Q) but behind A and K. Opponent could have A, K, T, etc. If we check, we give free card (river) which is a 9? Actually river unknown. Could be J giving us straight, but also could be something else.\n\nRaising could protect against draws? Opponent's range likely includes A, K, T, maybe draws. Since board has three diamonds, opponent could have flush draw (if they have two diamonds). But they have no diamond in hand (we don't know). They could have a diamond draw, they'd bet. They checked, maybe they have weak hand or draw.\n\nRaising small could extract value from worse hands like lower pairs, draws, or even force folds. But raising could also scare off draws.\n\nGiven we are short stack 18.8 BB, not huge but not extremely short. Raising 16 will commit ~5% of stack, okay.\n\nI think raise to 48? Minimum raise is 16. Could raise bigger to apply pressure. But we have limited info. Probably just check to see river.\n\nBut we have a gutshot and a pair; maybe we want to see river cheap. Check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

But we have queen high, likely losing to any pair (K, A, T) or any decent hand. Opponent could have missed draws and just check. Could be they have a weak hand like 9-7 offsuit, etc. We could try a small raise to steal some chips, but risk being called and losing more? Actually if we raise, we risk losing more chips if they call with a better hand. But we have no showdown value. Better to check and fold to any bet later (but we are at river, no later). So checking is safe; we might win pot of 32 chips anyway (they already checked). So action: check.\n\nLegal actions include raise, but we choose check.\n\nReasoning: queen high, no showdown value, opponent checked, likely has something better or a missed draw; we don't want to risk chips.\n\nThus output JSON.",

So raise to 32 (adds 16 more). We could also raise bigger. Hand Th7c is a weak suited connector, not great. In early position? Actually button, we have advantage. Stack is short (18 BB).

Th7c is not premium but can be used as a steal. However opponents may call with wide ranges. Might be okay to raise to 48 (3x BB) to apply pressure. But short stack, want to preserve chips. Could just call and see flop? But calling 16 for 40 pot gives us 2.5:1 odds, but hand is weak. Better to raise as a steal. Minimum raise to 32 yields 32 total bet, pot becomes 24+32=56, effective stack for opponents? SB 412 chips can call 32, BB 230 can call 32. Might be okay. Given we are short, we might want to go all-in? But all-in would be 292, huge overkill.\n\nThus raise to 48 (3BB) maybe. But legal raise min is 32, we can raise higher up to our stack.

          "content": "We have hand #71 preflop, BTN with 5d9d, stack 292 (18.2 BB). Blinds 8/16, SB posted 8, BB posted 16. So pot 24. To act, amount to call 16 (BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise of 16 more). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength, position, stack, opponent tendencies. Opponent seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is BB with 230 chips. Look at recall: many folds, some calls, some raises. In hand 59 they raised to 32 preflop (so a raise of 16). That suggests they sometimes raise from BB (maybe 3-bet? Actually they are BB, so they could raise as open-raise). In hand 67 they called 16 then bet 16 on flop. In hand 70 they called 16 then bet 16 flop. So they sometimes call and then bet. Not many raises. They seem to be a calling player, sometimes betting on flop after calling.\n\nOur hand 5d9d is weak, suited connectors but low. In BTN, we could consider stealing blind. But stack is relatively shallow (18 BB). The BB is 230 chips, about 12 BB. Actually 230 chips is about 12.9 BB. So we are short stacked relative to blinds? Our stack 292 (~18 BB). The BB's stack is smaller relative to us? Actually BB has 230 chips (~12.9 BB). So they are short too. The SB has 412 chips (~23 BB). So we are in a short stack scenario; raising may be good to steal blinds, but we have a weak hand.\n\nWe need to consider tournament considerations: preserving chips vs. accumulating. With 5d9d, it's not a good hand to raise; risk of being 3-bet? But BB may 3-bet rarely. In recall, they raised only once (hand 59) preflop to 32. That could be a 3-bet or open-raise from BB? Since we are BTN, they are BB; the only raise possible is 3-bet after SB's post? Actually SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then BTN acts. If we raise, it's a raise of 16 to 32 total? Actually minimum raise to 32 means we put total 32 chips, which is 2x BB. That's a standard raise.\n\nIf we call 16, we see flop with 5d9d, which is not strong but could have flush/straight draws.\n\nGiven our stack 18 BB, we could consider a raise to try to steal. But 5d9d is not a premium hand; but in short stack situations, you can raise with a wide range. However, the BB is also short; they may call with any two cards. If they call, we will be in a multi-way? Only SB and BB left; SB already posted 8, but hasn't acted yet (they are out of position). Actually SB posted 8, but after us, action goes to SB (seat1) then to BB (seat4) if we raise. If we just call, SB will act after us (they are first to act preflop after BTN). Wait order: SB (seat1) posted 8, then BB (seat4) posted 16, then BTN (us) acts, then action goes to SB (seat1) then BB (if still not acted). So we are between SB and BB. If we raise, SB can fold or call, then BB can call or 3-bet. So raising might get called by both short stacks.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, perhaps we should fold. But with 18 BB, folding many hands may be okay. Yet we are in BTN, we could attempt a steal with a wider range. 5d9d is not suited to the SB's range? Might be okay to raise as a steal. The SB's stack is 412 (~23 BB), they may defend with wide range. The BB's stack is 230 (~12.9 BB) and they may call with any. So raising could be risky.\n\nWe need to decide. Considering hand strength low, and both opponents are short stacks (likely to call or go all-in), I think folding is safest. Also we could call and see flop, but 5d9d doesn't have high equity preflop; calling 16 with 18 BB is okay but we risk being out of position post-flop. But we are in BTN, after flop we will be first to act (since SB is before BB). Actually after flop, action starts with SB then BB then BTN. So we will be last, which is good. However we have no strong hand.\n\nGiven we have 292"

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #71 preflop, BTN with 5d9d, stack 292 (18.2 BB). Blinds 8/16, SB posted 8, BB posted 16. So pot 24. To act, amount to call 16 (BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise of 16 more). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength, position, stack, opponent tendencies. Opponent seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is BB with 230 chips. Look at recall: many folds, some calls, some raises. In hand 59 they raised to 32 preflop (so a raise of 16). That suggests they sometimes raise from BB (maybe 3-bet? Actually they are BB, so they could raise as open-raise). In hand 67 they called 16 then bet 16 on flop. In hand 70 they called 16 then bet 16 flop. So they sometimes call and then bet. Not many raises. They seem to be a calling player, sometimes betting on flop after calling.\n\nOur hand 5d9d is weak, suited connectors but low. In BTN, we could consider stealing blind. But stack is relatively shallow (18 BB). The BB is 230 chips, about 12 BB. Actually 230 chips is about 12.9 BB. So we are short stacked relative to blinds? Our stack 292 (~18 BB). The BB's stack is smaller relative to us? Actually BB has 230 chips (~12.9 BB). So they are short too. The SB has 412 chips (~23 BB). So we are in a short stack scenario; raising may be good to steal blinds, but we have a weak hand.\n\nWe need to consider tournament considerations: preserving chips vs. accumulating. With 5d9d, it's not a good hand to raise; risk of being 3-bet? But BB may 3-bet rarely. In recall, they raised only once (hand 59) preflop to 32. That could be a 3-bet or open-raise from BB? Since we are BTN, they are BB; the only raise possible is 3-bet after SB's post? Actually SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then BTN acts. If we raise, it's a raise of 16 to 32 total? Actually minimum raise to 32 means we put total 32 chips, which is 2x BB. That's a standard raise.\n\nIf we call 16, we see flop with 5d9d, which is not strong but could have flush/straight draws.\n\nGiven our stack 18 BB, we could consider a raise to try to steal. But 5d9d is not a premium hand; but in short stack situations, you can raise with a wide range. However, the BB is also short; they may call with any two cards. If they call, we will be in a multi-way? Only SB and BB left; SB already posted 8, but hasn't acted yet (they are out of position). Actually SB posted 8, but after us, action goes to SB (seat1) then to BB (seat4) if we raise. If we just call, SB will act after us (they are first to act preflop after BTN). Wait order: SB (seat1) posted 8, then BB (seat4) posted 16, then BTN (us) acts, then action goes to SB (seat1) then BB (if still not acted). So we are between SB and BB. If we raise, SB can fold or call, then BB can call or 3-bet. So raising might get called by both short stacks.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, perhaps we should fold. But with 18 BB, folding many hands may be okay. Yet we are in BTN, we could attempt a steal with a wider range. 5d9d is not suited to the SB's range? Might be okay to raise as a steal. The SB's stack is 412 (~23 BB), they may defend with wide range. The BB's stack is 230 (~12.9 BB) and they may call with any. So raising could be risky.\n\nWe need to decide. Considering hand strength low, and both opponents are short stacks (likely to call or go all-in), I think folding is safest. Also we could call and see flop, but 5d9d doesn't have high equity preflop; calling 16 with 18 BB is okay but we risk being out of position post-flop. But we are in BTN, after flop we will be first to act (since SB is before BB). Actually after flop, action starts with SB then BB then BTN. So we will be last, which is good. However we have no strong hand.\n\nGiven we have 292",

Wait blinds: SB seat5 posted 8 (but seat5 is us? Actually actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 8. So we posted small blind. Seat1 post_bb 16. So seat1 is big blind. So we are SB, not BB. Actually position says BB (Seat5) but actions show seat5 posted sb. So maybe seat5 is BB but posted sb? Might be reversed. But amount to call is 8, meaning we need to call 8 to match BB 16? Wait amount to call 8 suggests we are facing a raise? Actually we posted sb 8, BB is 16, amount to call is 8 (to call BB). So we are SB. So we can fold, call (8 more to 16 total) or raise min to 32 total (i.e., raise 16 more). Hand Tc8h unsuited, not great. In SB vs BB with short stacks? Our stack 292 vs 364, both deep enough. Should we limp? Usually in SB vs BB, you can call (complete) with a wide range, but with 8BB stack, calling is fine. Tc8h is a marginal hand; may be okay to call, but also could raise to isolate. However opponent's tendencies: recall shows they often call preflop (hand 74) and sometimes check/fold. They have folded many times. Not much aggression. Probably they are passive. Raising could steal BB? But they are BB, they already have 16 in pot. Raising may get them to fold many times, but they might call with wide range. Our hand is not strong enough to continue postflop against a likely call. So best is to call (complete) and see flop cheap.

Actually preflop big blind 16, pot 32, min raise is 16? Possibly they define raise_to as total amount you put in, not additional. So raise_to = 48? Not sure. But we can raise to 48 (i.e., 16 more). Anyway.\n\nWe need to decide action. Opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 364, we have 284. They checked flop. We have pair 8, not strong but could be best. Opponent could have queen, could have 8, could have straight draws. Our hand is medium. With 17.8 BB, we can consider raising to protect and get value if they have weaker hand (like 6, 8? Actually they could have 8? they'd have set? No set would be 8? board 8s, we have 8h, so we have pair, not set. Opponent could have 8? they'd have two eights, they'd have pair of eights as well, but we have kicker T vs their kicker maybe something else.\n\nWe can also check and see next street. With 17 BB, maybe we want to preserve chips. Opponent's tendencies unknown. Could be aggressive? We have no recall data.\n\nGiven we have top pair (maybe not top if opponent has Q), but we have decent hand. Might consider a small raise to protect and get value from worse hands like 6, 7, or draws. But risk of being raised by stronger queen. However we are BB, we have position? Actually after flop, it's opponent's turn (Seat1) then us (Seat5). So we are out of position? Actually we are in BB, they are in SB? Wait seat1 posted BB, seat5 posted SB? Actually preflop: seat5 post_sb 8, seat1 post_bb 16. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB, out of position postflop (SB acts first). So we are first to act. So we can check.\n\nGiven we have medium strength, checking is safe. Raising could be good to protect against draws, but we risk being raised and losing chips. With 17 BB, I'd likely check and see.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

That's a pair of sixes on board. Our 8h gives us a pair of eights plus board pair gives two pair: eights and sixes. No queen. So we have two pair, not a set. Opponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 with 364 chips, still in hand. We are BB. Turn action: amount to call 0, can check or raise. Need to consider opponent's tendencies: we saw no raise history. We can maybe check to see river? But opponent may have queen, or a set (6s?), but board already has pair of sixes, could have 6x for trips. Opponent could also have Qx for top pair. Our two pair is decent but vulnerable. Pot is 32, stacks: opponent 364, us 284. If we check, opponent could bet river. If we raise now, we can protect against draws? Board: no flush draws (two spades, Q\u2660,8\u2660). Straight draws? Board: 8,6,Q,6. Straight possibilities: 7-9? Not many. So not many draws. We could consider betting to extract value from weaker hands like a queen, a 6, or a single 8? Actually opponent could have a 6 for trips (makes three of a kind). That's stronger. Could have Q for top pair, which we beat. Could have a straight draw? Not likely. So maybe we should bet for value. Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total bet 16). Pot 32, raise to 16 gives us 48 total pot if called. That is small but okay.\n\nCheck: If we check, opponent could check back or bet. If they bet, we can call or raise.

Qs and 9h: not suited). So Q9 offsuit is marginal. Position button, can steal blinds. Opponents: Seat1 Kimi-K2 is SB with 356 chips, Seat4 MiniMax-M2 is BB with 262 chips. Both have some raise tendencies: Kimi-K2 raised 14 (maybe 1.75x) and 6 (maybe 0.75x) preflop in past. MiniMax-M2 raises varied: small raises 4 (maybe 0.5x), 8, 28, 32. So both can raise small.\n\nWe are on button with 19.8 BB, need to consider tournament: relatively short stack but not crisis. Steal attempt could be good. Q9 offsuit is not premium but can be used for steal. Risk: if called, we may be dominated by better hands. However, both opponents have stacks: SB 356 (22.25 BB), BB 262 (16.4 BB). If we raise to 48 (3x BB), they'd need to call. Could be fold.\n\nBut we have only 19.8 BB, raising to 48 would be 3BB, leaving 268 chips. That's okay. Minimum raise is 32 (2 BB). Raise to 48 is a 3x raise.\n\nConsider equity vs typical calling range. If they call with any pair, broadway, suited connectors, they have equity >50. Q9 offsuit vs that is low. But maybe they fold often.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe better to just call and see flop? But calling 16 will commit half stack. That seems risky.\n\nBetter to raise to 48 (3x) as steal. If called, we can evaluate flop; but we will be out of position preflop? Actually we will be first to act after flop (SB first). But we are button, after raise, action goes to SB then BB. If they call, we will be out of position.\n\nGiven Q9 offsuit, maybe we should just fold? But we have 19.8 BB, folding loses 16 chips (blinds) and we keep stack. Could be okay.\n\nBut typical button steal range includes Q9o? Many players raise with Q9o. So raise.\n\nThus decision: raise to 48 (or maybe 48 is max? Minimum raise is 32, we can raise to 48). Let's raise to 48.\n\nReasoning: attempt to steal blinds, hand decent, short stack, opponents have shown tendency to raise small but also fold to raises.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Actually raise to 32 total? The action line: \"Seat 4 raise 32\". Since SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then seat 4 raise 32 meaning they put total 32? Usually raise amount is total bet amount.

Actually Q-J-T-9-8 is a straight). So if opponent holds J9, they'd have straight. Also KJ would give K Q J T 8? That's not straight. So the only straight combos are J9, 9J, maybe 7 9? 9 7 would be 9-8-7-? No, need 7 9? 9-8-7-? Not a straight. So only J9 combos make straight. Also any pair of Q, T, 8 would give trips or two pair.

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called preflop and also checked flop. All three checked flop. So turn now. We have a pair of 6s, board is Q K T 8, all high cards, possible straight draws? Board: Ten, Eight, Queen, King. That is a possible straight draw: 9-10-J-Q-K would be a straight, we have no 9 or J. Opponent could have a straight draw like J9, or a made hand like KQ, QJ, etc. Our hand is likely worst.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: we have 316, opponent 222, other 324. Pot is 96. Turn is next street, but we haven't seen the turn card yet? Actually board shows only four cards: Th 8h Qd Kc. That's flop? Wait board listed is Th 8h Qd Kc. That's four cards, so this is turn. So turn card is Kc? Actually board includes turn. So we are on turn, after flop (Th 8h Qd) and turn (Kc). So board now: Ten hearts, Eight hearts, Queen diamonds, King clubs. No flush possible yet (two hearts). Straight draws: J9 would give straight. Also 9-10-J-Q-K is a straight. Also possible A-K-Q-J-10? We have KQ10, but need J and A? Actually A-K-Q-J-10 is straight, but need J. So any hand with J9, J10, etc.\n\nOur pair of sixes is basically a dead hand. Likely fold. Check is possible but we could also check and see river. No bet to call. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Raising would be weird with pair of 6s. So we should check.\n\nThus action: check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Opponents: Seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted SB 8, Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) posted BB 16. We are BTN, facing a raise? Actually amount to call 16, min raise to 32. So the BB is 16, SB 8, we are to act after BB? Wait order: SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then BTN action: amount to call 16 (i.e., call BB). So no raise yet; we can call 16, raise to at least 32 (total). So legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength. T5 offsuit is a weak hand, especially in early tournament with 19.8 BB. In BTN, can consider stealing blinds, but T5o is not great for steal; typical raise range from BTN is broader maybe 20-30% but T5o is lower edge. However we have 19.8 BB, not huge but decent. Opponent tendencies: Seat1 (SB) appears to call 16 in hand 79 (preflop call). Also sometimes checks, folds. Not much raising data. Seat4 (BB) hasn't acted yet; we have no data. Could be a tight player? Not enough info.\n\nGiven weak hand, likely fold. But consider possibility of raising to steal both blinds. SB may call with wide range? In hand 79, SB called 16 (the BB) with unknown hand. Could be wide. But raising with T5o is risky because if called by BB (MiniMax-M2) who might have a stronger hand, we risk losing ~32 chips. Our stack is 316, losing 32 is ~10% of stack, not huge but could be.\n\nGiven tournament early stage, preserving stack is important. I'd fold.\n\nThus output JSON with action fold, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

That is a raise of 96 total (i.e., 64 more). That would be 3x BB (96) and 3x opponent's raise? Actually min raise is 96 total, which is 64 more than call (32). So raise to 96 = total bet 96, meaning we put 96 chips (including the 32 call). That would be 3 BB (96) vs opponent's 64 raise. Our stack 284, could also go all-in (284). But with K4 suited, not a strong hand. Should we fold? In short stack, maybe consider shove if we think opponent is stealing with wide range. But K4c is not a great hand to shove; but could be okay vs a raise from MP/CO maybe? However we have only 8.9 BB, typical push/fold threshold is about 10 BB, you can shove with a decent range, but K4c is marginal. Also opponent's raise size 64 (2 BB) over BB; that's a standard raise. Their range likely includes many broadways, suited connectors, etc. K4c is at bottom of push range. Better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

Minimum raise to 96 (i.e., raise amount total = 96). Amount to call is 48 (they raised 64, we posted 16, so need 48 more). Hand As4c is weak suited Ace low kicker. In SB, short stack 8.4 BB, need to consider fold or call? 48 call is 1.5 BB (since SB is 16 BB, but effective BB is 32). Actually 48 is 1.5 BB (relative to big blind). With 8.4 BB stack, calling 48 leaves us with 268-48=220 chips, still decent. But As4c is not great for calling a raise from MP (seat 4 maybe MP). Opponent's raise size is 64 (2 BB raise). In SB, typical open raise from MP is 2-2.5 BB. So they are raising standard. With A4s, it's a marginal hand. Could consider calling to see flop with suited Ace, maybe try to see cheap flop, but we are out of position for rest of hand. However stack is shallow, but not super short. In tournament, with 8.4 BB, we should be careful not to waste chips. A4s is not a good call; maybe fold.\n\nWe can also consider raising (3-bet) to 96 total (i.e., raise 96). That would be 96 total, which is 3 BB raise (since big blind 32). That would be 96-16 posted = 80 additional. But we have 268, can raise. But 3-bet with A4s is too weak, likely not good.\n\nThus best action: fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been raising sometimes (hand 81 raise 64 preflop). Also raised 64 in hand 81. So they are capable of raising with a range. Not a tight player. So folding is safe.\n\nThus output JSON.",

It's our turn, we face 32 to call (i.e., just the BB). Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., raise 32 more). With 8.4 BB, AQ is a strong hand, but short stack; we could go all-in (268) but raise to 64 is small. Typically with 8 BB, you either shove or call? In tournaments, with 8 BB, you could shove to maximize fold equity, but also could call to see flop if you think you have good equity. However, AQ is strong but not premium like AK or AA. Many players would shove. Also consider opponents: seat1 (Kimi) has 584 chips, seat4 (MiniMax) has 58 chips (short stack). So there is a short stack at BB with 58 chips; they are already all-in? No they posted BB 32, they still have 26 left. They could be forced to act later. If we raise, they may call or fold. With 8 BB, a raise to 64 is about 2 BB, still leaves them with enough to call. But maybe better to go all-in to maximize pressure on both. Since we have 268, all-in is 268, which is 8.4 BB, but they'd need to call 236 more. That's huge. Likely they fold. So optimal: raise all-in (i.e., raise_to 268). But check legal actions: raise is allowed, we can raise to any amount up to our stack. So choose raise to 268 (all-in).

Wait positions: Seat 5 is SB, seat 1 is BB, seat 4 is maybe UTG? Actually seat numbers not matter. The action: SB posted 16, BB posted 32, seat 4 call 32 (so they are likely under the gun? Actually they are before SB? Not needed). So pot currently: 16+32+32 = 80 (as given). Amount to call is 16 (to match BB's 32? Actually SB posted 16, BB 32, seat 4 called 32, so SB needs to call 16 to match 32). Minimum raise to 64 (so raise total to 64). With short stack 316 chips, 9.9 BB. A5 suited is a decent hand for steal? In SB vs BB and a caller. There are 3 players in pot. Stack is short but not ultra short. A5 suited has some potential but not premium. Considering we are short stack, we may want to go all-in if we raise. Minimum raise is 64, which is 2 BB. That's about 2% of stack. Could just call to see flop? But with 5\u2660 A\u2660, we have ace high, maybe decent for showdown if we hit Ace. But against 3 players, likely not.\n\nWe could consider raising to steal blinds, but there is a caller already (seat 4). That player called BB, indicating they likely have a decent hand (maybe a wide range). Raising may get called or re-raised, but we are short stack. Might be better to go all-in to maximize fold equity? Minimum raise to 64 is small; we could raise to maybe 128 or go all-in (316). But raise to 64 is not enough to pressure them; they could call cheap. Better to go all-in to put pressure and maybe win pot. With A5 suited, it's a decent hand to go all-in short stack. So action: raise to 316 (all-in). Need to ensure legal: raise is allowed, minimum raise to 64, we can raise to any amount up to stack. So raise to 316.\n\nReasoning: short stack, need to accumulate chips, A5 suited decent, steal with all-in.\n\nThus output JSON.",

But with short stack, we might want to go all-in to maximize fold equity. However min raise is 48, we could raise to maybe 200? Need to consider opponent seat1 has 536 chips, about 16.7 BB. He just checked from small blind. Likely will call or fold. Raising to a decent amount could isolate. At 12 BB, typical push/fold threshold is around 0.5-0.6 BB? Actually push all-in is typical at <10 BB. At 12 BB, you can still raise and maybe get called. I think best is to raise to maybe 120 (3 big blinds) to put pressure. But we have to consider we are short and want to accumulate chips. AJ is top 10% hand. I think raising to min raise 48 is too small, could be called cheaply. Better to go all-in? All-in would be 396 chips, which is about 12 BB, which is a huge bet relative to pot (26). That could force fold from many but also risk being called by bigger stack. But AJ is strong enough to risk. However typical tournament strategy: push all-in when stack <= 15 BB and have a decent hand. So I will go all-in (raise to 396). Need to set raise_to total amount.

So we face a raise of 48 from SB, from a player \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\". Our stack 386, we can call 48 (to 48). Hand 2-9 suited is very weak. In tournament with short stack 12 BB, but still not a candidate for shove? Could consider shove (all-in) 386 vs 48 raise. But 2-9 suited is not a good shoving hand, especially against a raise from SB who may be tighter? We need opponent tendencies: recall shows raise amounts: 48, 32, 48, 200, 276. Mixed sizes. Not clear if they are aggressive. Likely they raise a range of hands, maybe wide. But 2-9 suited still low equity even vs wide range. With 12 BB, we could consider a shove if we think fold equity enough. However 2-9 suited is among worst suited connectors. In 12 BB, standard push/fold ranges on button: you can push with any suited ace, broadway, maybe any pair, and some suited connectors like 76s, 87s, maybe 65s. 2-9s is too low.

So we are in the small blind, out of position to BB.\n\nOur hand 9d8h is suited? No, 9d 8h unsuited. Not great.\n\nStack is shallow 12 BB. We are facing a BB of 32, we have already posted 16. To continue we need to call 16 more (to match BB). Minimum raise to 64 total (i.e., raise by 48). So we can fold, call 16, or raise to 64 (or more). With 9-8 offsuit, typical play is to fold in SB against a BB who hasn't shown aggression, especially short stack. But maybe we could raise as a steal? But we are SB, not in position. Raising may be okay to steal BB's 32, but we have only 12 BB; a raise of 64 would be 2 BB (including our 16). That's a decent raise size. However 9-8 offsuit is not a strong hand to raise; risk of being called and playing out of position. BB's tendencies: from recall, recent actions: hand 89 preflop raise 48 (i.e., raise to 48? Actually min raise is 64, but they raised 48 maybe they were in a different blind structure). Hard to interpret. In hand 89 they raised preflop. In other hands they folded or checked. So maybe they are somewhat aggressive but also fold often.\n\nGiven short stack, we might consider a shove? Minimum raise to 64 is not all-in; all-in would be 386 total (or 370 remaining after SB). But raising to 64 is a modest raise. With 9-8 off, I think fold is best.\n\nPot odds: to call 16 to win 48 (pot currently 48 + 16 call = 64). So need ~25% equity. 9-8 offsuit vs random BB range maybe ~15% equity, not enough. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

Actually we have 10, K, Q, need J for straight. So we have two draws: flush draw (9 outs? clubs left: there are 13 clubs total, we have 2, board has 1, so 10 clubs left, but two of them would give us a straight flush?

With draws, betting can be good to build pot if we hit, but also can fold out better hands? Opponent may have a made hand like Kx, Tx, etc. If we bet, we risk being called and losing chips.

Our stack 354, so we can call.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall shows that Kimi-K2 has bet on flop in two prior hands: amounts 4 and 15 (small relative to pot). Those were small bets. Here bet is 48, which is 0.75 BB? Wait blinds 16/32, so 48 is 1.5 BB (since BB=32). That's moderate. Might be continuation bet (c-bet). Our hand is weak, drawing. Should we call? Pot odds: call 48 to win pot of 160+48? Actually after call, pot will be 112+48+48 = 208. So call 48 for pot 208, odds = 48/208 = 23% required. Our outs: we need a 9 for straight (4 outs). Also any club for flush? We have two clubs (Qc4c), board has no clubs. There are 13 clubs total, we have 2, so 9 clubs left. Some clubs also give straight? The 9c also club gives straight and flush. So total outs: 4 nines + 9 clubs = 13, but double count 9c counted twice, so unique outs = 4+9-1 = 12. Also Ace maybe? Not relevant.\n\n12 outs, turn and river: probability to hit by river = 1 - (C(39,2)/C(47,2)) approx. Approx chance: 12/47 + (35/47)*(12/46) = 0.255+0.194=0.449 ~45%. So about 45% chance to improve to at least a straight or flush. However many of those outs give us a decent hand but may still be second best if opponent has Kx etc. Opponent's range: They called preflop from SB, so they have a wide range, likely includes broadway combos, maybe Kx, Ax, etc. Board: Kc, Td, 6h. They have bet. Could have Kx (top pair), T, 6, straight draws, etc. Our queen is a gutshot; if we hit 9 we have straight 9-T-J-Q-K? Actually board Kc Td 6h, we would have 9c making 9-10-J-Q-K? Wait we need J? Straight would be 9-10-J-Q-K but we don't have J. So 9 does not give straight. Actually need 9-10-J-Q-K? No we have Qc, need J and 9? Let's compute: board: 6, T, K. Our hand Q,4. Straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K (needs 9 and J). We only get 9, not J. So 9 does not give straight. Wait what straight does 9 give? 6-7-8-9-10? Need 7,8,9. Not. So 9 is not a straight. Actually our gutshot is 9 for straight? Let's check: we have Q, we need J? The board has T and K, missing J and Q? We have Q, so need J? Actually we could have J for straight J-10-Q-K? That's not straight. Straight requires 5 consecutive. With board T, K, we need 9-J-Q? That's not consecutive. Let's think: Our hand Qc4c. The board: 6, T, K. To make a straight, we need 9-J? Not possible. The only straight possible with K and T is 9-10-J-Q-K (needs 9 and J). So we need both 9 and J, not just 9. So we have a gutshot? Actually we need a 9 and a J; we have Q, so we need both 9 and J. That's a double gutshot? Not exactly. So we have no immediate draw. The only outs are clubs for flush (9 outs). Also maybe a straight draw with 9 and J? That's two cards, not immediate.\n\nThus outs: 9 clubs. Also maybe a pair of Q (queen) to make top pair? We have Qc, board no Q.

          "reasoning_content": "We need decide action on flop. Situation: we are BTN (seat5) with 6c 9s. Board Qd 7h 7s. Pot 128. Stack 290 (9.1 BB). Preflop we raised to 64 (i.e., 2x big blind?) Actually SB 16, BB 32, we raised 64 (so total 64?), then opponent called 32. So pot after preflop = 64+32+16+32? Wait SB posted 16, BB posted 32, then raise to 64 (meaning we put 64 total). So total preflop contributions: SB 16, BB 32, our raise 64, opponent call 32. So pot = 16+32+64+32 = 144? But they say pot 128 on flop. Might be they count only after flop? Anyway.\n\nFlop: Qd 7h 7s. Opponent (seat1) checked. We have 6c9s, which is a gutshot straight draw? Actually board: Q-7-7. Our hand: 6 and 9. We have open-ended? The board pairs 7s, we have 6 and 9: possible straight draws: 8 would give 7-8-9-10-J? Not. Let's see combos: With 6 and 9, we have a gutshot to a straight: need 8 for 6-7-8-9-10? Actually board has Q,7,7. To make straight with our cards we need 8 and 10? Wait need 5-card sequence. Our cards: 6 and 9. Combine with board: 7,7,Q. The best possible straight using our hole cards would be 6-7-8-9-10, but we lack 8 and 10, and board doesn't have 8 or 10. So we need both 8 and 10 on turn and river, not a good draw.\n\nWe have pair? No. We have no pair, no overcards (Q is higher than 9,6). So we have basically a weak hand, just backdoor possibilities (maybe a flush? Suits: 6c,9s, board: Qd 7h 7s. We have a spade 9 and board has a spade 7, so we have a backdoor flush draw (needs two more spades). Not strong.\n\nOpponent checked. Likely they have a weak hand or a medium hand (maybe a queen, a 7, or a set? They could have a set of 7s (but they would likely bet). Could have Qx, they'd probably bet. Could have overpair? Not possible (board Q). Could have a draw like KJ for gutshot? Not likely.\n\nGiven our weak hand, we should check (or possibly bet as a bluff). Our stack is short (9 BB). Opponent has 524 chips (big stack). We could try a bluff raise? Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise to 32 total?). Actually raise to 32 means total bet of 32? Since amount to call is 0, minimum raise is 32 (i.e., bet 32). That would be a small bet ~1/4 pot (pot 128). Could be a continuation bet (c-bet) as we raised preflop. Many players c-bet on flop with overpairs, but here board is paired and Q high; we have no equity. A small bet may be called by many, losing chips. Better to check and see turn.\n\nThus action: check. Reasoning: weak hand, no equity, opponent checked, likely they have something, we want to preserve stack.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Could have a higher pair like Qx, or a set of 7s (if they have a 7), or a full house (7-7-7-9-9). Opponent checking suggests they may be weak or have a medium hand. We have very short stack (9.1 BB). Could consider a small raise to try to steal? But we have a weak hand, and raising may get called by a better hand and we lose chips. Better to check and hope we are best?

Wait actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 16, Seat1 post_bb 32. So we are SB? Actually seat5 is BTN but they posted SB? Might be mislabel: In this hand, seat5 posted SB 16, seat1 posted BB 32. So we are SB with 6h Ts. So we are out of position relative to BB? Actually SB is first to act preflop after blinds, then BB acts. So we act first, facing only blind amounts.\n\nWe have amount to call 16 (to match BB? Actually BB is 32, we posted 16, so to call we need to put additional 16 to match BB). Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., raise total to 64, which is 48 more). Legal actions fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Hand 6T unsuited, medium strength. In short stack 14.6 BB, SB position, facing a BB who may be tight? Need opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking is BB. Look at recall: many raises with varied sizes, sometimes big (200, 276) indicating possibly aggressive. Could be willing to raise big. But also many small raises (6,7,12). So unpredictable. In SB with 6T, typical strategy: if you have 14 BB, you could consider stealing blind by raising, but 6T is not premium. Might be okay to call and see flop? But out of position, risk of playing deep post-flop with weak hand. Could also fold and preserve stack.\n\nStack 466, blinds 48 total. If we call 16, we will have 450 left, still 14 BB. If we raise to 64, we risk 48 more. Is 6T good for steal? Not ideal. Might be better to fold and wait for better.\n\nGiven opponent may raise big, but currently they haven't acted yet; they are BB, will act after us. If we raise, they can call or re-raise. With 6T, not great.\n\nThus likely fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Board clubs: none. So no flush draw. Straight draws? Board: A,T,6. Our hand: A,2. We have pair of Aces, but also potential for a full house? Not yet. Opponent (Seat1) raised flop to 180 after we bet 48. So pot before opponent raise: preflop pot 388? Wait pot after preflop: blinds 16+32 + raise 80 + call 48 = 176? Actually compute: SB 16, BB 32, raise 80 (to 96 total?), Let's compute: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. Then SB raises to 80 (meaning adds 64 more). So total SB = 80, BB = 32, then BB calls 48 (to match 80). So pot after preflop: 80+80? Wait SB 80, BB 80 (since BB called 48 extra). So pot = 160. But given pot is 388 at flop, maybe there are antes or something. But we accept given pot 388.\n\nWe bet 48 on flop (likely half pot). Opponent raised to 180, so raise total 180, amount to call 132 (since we already put 48). Minimum raise to 312 (i.e., raise at least to 312). Our stack 338, we can raise to 312 (which is 312 total, meaning additional 264? Actually we have already 48 in pot; to raise to 312 we need to put total 312, meaning additional 264). That's possible (stack 338). So legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have top pair Aces, but opponent's raise could indicate stronger hand: maybe a set (6s?), but board has 6s, we have no 6. Opponent could have pocket tens (TT) for trips, or pocket As (AA) for set (but we have Ace of clubs, they could have Ace of hearts/diamonds/spades). Could be a straight (9-8). But board A T 6, a straight would be 8-9? Actually need 8-9 to make 6-7-8-9-T? No board lacks 7,8,9. Straight combos: 9-8 would give 8-9-10-J-Q? Not. So only possible straight combos: 9-8? Not. So likely opponent has a set (TT or 66) or two pair (AT). Could also have a flush draw? No clubs. Could have Ace with good kicker (AJ, AQ). But raise size is large: 180 to 48 call, so they are raising ~3.75x the bet. This is a sizable raise, maybe they have a strong hand or a bluff.\n\nOur stack is shallow (10.6 BB). Pot after opponent raise: pot = 388 + 48 (our bet) + 180 (their raise) = 616? Actually pot before flop bet was 388. We bet 48, making pot 436. Opponent raises to 180, adding 132 extra (since they already matched 48). So new pot = 436 + 132 = 568? Wait need to compute: Starting pot 388. We bet 48, pot becomes 436. Opponent raises to 180, meaning they put total 180, which is 132 more than our 48, so pot becomes 436 + 132 = 568. Yes pot 568.\n\nWe have 338 stack, we have already 48 in pot, so remaining stack 338-48 = 290. To call 132 we need to put 132, leaving 158. To raise to 312 (total), we need to put 312-48 = 264, leaving 26 chips left (so near all-in). Actually raising to 312 would be a big raise, near all-in. Could also go all-in 338, but min raise is 312, we could raise to 338 (all-in). But raise to 312 is allowed.\n\nDecision: With top pair Aces, but opponent could have a set. Our kicker is weak. With short stack, we might consider calling if we think we are ahead, but risk of being dominated. However, we have Ace of clubs, which is the nut flush draw? No clubs on board, so not. Our equity vs set is low.\n\nWe could also consider raising all-in to put pressure, but opponent likely ahead, raising could get called and we lose more. Better to call and see turn? Turn unknown.

Actually we have clubs: Ace of clubs, 2 of clubs. Board clubs: none. So no flush draw. Straight draws? Board: A,T,6. Our hand: A,2. We have pair of Aces, but also potential for a full house? Not yet. Opponent (Seat1) raised flop to 180 after we bet 48. So pot before opponent raise: preflop pot 388? Wait pot after preflop: blinds 16+32 + raise 80 + call 48 = 176? Actually compute: SB 16, BB 32, raise 80 (to 96 total?), Let's compute: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. Then SB raises to 80 (meaning adds 64 more). So total SB = 80, BB = 32, then BB calls 48 (to match 80). So pot after preflop: 80+80? Wait SB 80, BB 80 (since BB called 48 extra). So pot = 160. But given pot is 388 at flop, maybe there are antes or something. But we accept given pot 388.\n\nWe bet 48 on flop (likely half pot). Opponent raised to 180, so raise total 180, amount to call 132 (since we already put 48). Minimum raise to 312 (i.e., raise at least to 312). Our stack 338, we can raise to 312 (which is 312 total, meaning additional 264? Actually we have already 48 in pot; to raise to 312 we need to put total 312, meaning additional 264). That's possible (stack 338). So legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have top pair Aces, but opponent's raise could indicate stronger hand: maybe a set (6s?), but board has 6s, we have no 6. Opponent could have pocket tens (TT) for trips, or pocket As (AA) for set (but we have Ace of clubs, they could have Ace of hearts/diamonds/spades). Could be a straight (9-8).

Opponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 216 chips, SB originally 16, now after preflop they raised to 80, we called 48 (so we have 32+48=80 contributed). Flop: board 6s Ad Td. We bet 48 (half pot?), pot before flop: 80+16? Let's calculate: Preflop: SB 16, BB 32, raise to 80 (SB raise 64 more), we call 48 (so we put 48 more). So total preflop contributions: SB 80, BB 80 (32+48). Pot 160. Flop: we bet 48, opponent raised to 180, we called 132. So after flop, pot: preflop 160 + our 48 + opponent 180 + our 132 = 520. That matches given pot 520 at turn. Turn card unknown? Actually board includes turn? Turn is after this stage: board currently shows 6s Ad Td 4c. So turn is 4c (clubs). That gave us a flush draw? We have Ac 2c, board has 4c, so we have two clubs in hand, one club on board, need two more clubs for flush. Not there yet.\n\nOur hand: top pair Aces with a weak kicker, plus a backdoor flush draw (clubs). Also possible straight draws? Board: A T 6 4. No straight possibilities.\n\nOpponent's actions: On flop we bet 48, they raised to 180 (big raise). That suggests they have strong hand or a draw. Could be two pair, set, strong Ace with good kicker, or maybe a draw like flush draw (they have clubs). They could also be bluff. We called.\n\nNow turn: 4c adds a club, giving us a flush draw (two clubs in hand + one on board). Opponent could have clubs as well. Our top pair Aces but weak kicker; opponent could have A with better kicker (like AK, AQ, AJ, AT), could have set of 6s or Ts? No, board has 6s and Td; set of 6 would be 6x, but we would have seen flop raise maybe. Could be a set of 6s (6c? Actually 6s on board, there are two other 6s in deck; they could have 6c 6h etc). Set of 6s would be strong, they'd likely continue. Could be two pair (AdTd) with a good kicker. Could be a straight draw? Not possible.\n\nOur stack: 206 chips total, we have 206 left, we have already contributed 80+48+132 = 260? Wait that exceeds stack. Actually our stack is 206 chips total at start of hand? It says stack 206 chips (6.4 BB). That's after posting BB? Yes our stack after posting BB is 206. Then we called 48 preflop, leaving 158. Then we bet 48 on flop, leaving 110. Then we called 132 on flop raise (but we only have 110 left!). Something off: Actually our stack is 206 chips at start of hand (including BB). We posted 32, leaving 174. Then we called raise 48 (meaning we put extra 48 after the raise? Actually preflop: SB raise 80 (to 80 total). BB call 48 (so we put 48 more, total 80). So after call, our remaining stack: 206-32-48 = 126? Wait we posted 32, then added 48 = total 80, leaving 126. Flop: we bet 48, leaving 78. Opponent raised to 180, we call 132, but we only have 78 left. So actually we must be all-in. But the given data says amount to call 0, min raise 132, legal actions: fold, check, raise. So maybe the stack numbers are after contributions? Possibly the stack shown is remaining after contributions? It says your stack: 206 chips (6.4 BB). That is current stack before turn action. So after flop call, we have 206 left. That implies the pot contributions were from opponent's stack? Hmm.\n\nLet's accept given: we have 206 chips remaining, pot 520, min raise 132, we can raise up to maybe all-in.\n\nWe need to decide action. Evaluate equity: Our hand A\u26632\u2663 vs opponent unknown. Opponent likely has strong hand, maybe A with good kicker, or set, or two pair,"

Set of 6s would be strong, they'd likely continue. Could be two pair (AdTd) with a good kicker. Could be a straight draw? Not possible.\n\nOur stack: 206 chips total, we have 206 left, we have already contributed 80+48+132 = 260? Wait that exceeds stack. Actually our stack is 206 chips total at start of hand? It says stack 206 chips (6.4 BB). That's after posting BB? Yes our stack after posting BB is 206. Then we called 48 preflop, leaving 158. Then we bet 48 on flop, leaving 110. Then we called 132 on flop raise (but we only have 110 left!). Something off: Actually our stack is 206 chips at start of hand (including BB). We posted 32, leaving 174. Then we called raise 48 (meaning we put extra 48 after the raise? Actually preflop: SB raise 80 (to 80 total). BB call 48 (so we put 48 more, total 80). So after call, our remaining stack: 206-32-48 = 126? Wait we posted 32, then added 48 = total 80, leaving 126. Flop: we bet 48, leaving 78. Opponent raised to 180, we call 132, but we only have 78 left. So actually we must be all-in. But the given data says amount to call 0, min raise 132, legal actions: fold, check, raise. So maybe the stack numbers are after contributions? Possibly the stack shown is remaining after contributions? It says your stack: 206 chips (6.4 BB). That is current stack before turn action. So after flop call, we have 206 left. That implies the pot contributions were from opponent's stack? Hmm.\n\nLet's accept given: we have 206 chips remaining, pot 520, min raise 132, we can raise up to maybe all-in.\n\nWe need to decide action. Evaluate equity: Our hand A\u26632\u2663 vs opponent unknown. Opponent likely has strong hand, maybe A with good kicker, or set, or two pair,",

Also have a flush draw? Suits: board has diamonds: Ad Td, we have Ac (clubs) 2c, so not flush. Straight draw? Board: 6, A, T, 4. No. So only pair of Aces, weak kicker. Opponent (seat 1) bet 216 into pot 736. Pot before bet? Let's compute: preflop pot: blinds 48 + call 48 = 96? Actually preflop: SB 16, BB 32, raise 80 (total 96?), then call 48 (so raise to 80? Wait details: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. SB raise 80 (so total 96?), BB call 48 (makes total 144?). Let's compute: SB posted 16, then raise to 80 means adds 64 more? Actually raise 80 likely means total bet 80. So SB bet 80, BB call 48 (to match 80). So pot after preflop: SB 80 + BB 80 = 160? plus blinds? Already accounted. So pot 160.\n\nFlop: board 6s Ad Td. BB bet 48, then seat1 raise 180, then BB call 132. So flop betting: BB bet 48, seat1 raise to 180 (so additional 132), BB call 132. So pot after flop: starting 160 + 48+180+132 = 520? Let's compute: after preflop pot 160. Flop: BB bet 48 -> pot 208. Seat1 raise to 180 (adds 180) -> pot 388. BB call 132 -> pot 520. Good.\n\nTurn: board 4c. BB check, seat1 bets 216. So pot before turn bet: 520. Seat1 bet 216, making pot 736 (as given). So we face 216 to call.\n\nOur hand: top pair Aces, but weak kicker. Opponent's range: they raised preflop from SB (seat1). Preflop raise size 80 (3x BB). That indicates a fairly wide range, maybe any Ace, broadway, pairs, suited connectors. On flop, they raised after our bet, showing strength. They could have a strong Ace, a set, two pair, maybe a straight draw? Board is A T 6. They could have A? They could have a hand like AK, AQ, AJ, AT (two pair), or a set of 6s (but board has 6s, not 6c). Set of 6s would be 6x, they'd have 6s? Actually board 6s, so set would be 6s? Need two 6s in hand, improbable. Could be a set of T? board has Td, so set of Ts would be TT, they'd have TT. Could be a set of A? board has Ad, so set of As would be AA, they'd have Ace. So they could have AA (but we have Ac, so they can't have AA). They could have a straight draw like 9-8? Not on board.\n\nTurn 4c adds a club, giving us a flush draw? No, we have clubs A\u26632\u2663, board clubs only 4c, so we have two clubs, need two more clubs on board for flush, not there.\n\nOur hand is likely second best vs many combos.

Actually stack before action is 206, but we already have some in pot? Our effective stack after call would be 206 - 216? Wait we have 206 chips total, we have already contributed some to pot: preflop call 48, flop call 132, turn check 0. So remaining stack = 206 - (48+132) = 26 chips. Actually we started with 206 chips total. We posted BB 32 (but that is part of stack). Let's compute: Starting stack 206. Posted BB 32 (so 174 left). Call preflop 48 (to match raise) means we put additional 48? Actually we called 48 after raise to 80, so we put 48 more, leaving 126. Flop bet 48 (we bet) leaving 78.

No, we have clubs A\u26632\u2663, board clubs only 4c, so we have two clubs, need two more clubs on board for flush, not there.\n\nOur hand is likely second best vs many combos. Opponent betting 216 on turn could be continuation bet with a wide range, maybe trying to fold us. But we have top pair; we could call. However our stack is 206 chips total, we have 206 left? Actually stack before action is 206, but we already have some in pot? Our effective stack after call would be 206 - 216? Wait we have 206 chips total, we have already contributed some to pot: preflop call 48, flop call 132, turn check 0. So remaining stack = 206 - (48+132) = 26 chips. Actually we started with 206 chips total. We posted BB 32 (but that is part of stack). Let's compute: Starting stack 206. Posted BB 32 (so 174 left). Call preflop 48 (to match raise) means we put additional 48? Actually we called 48 after raise to 80, so we put 48 more, leaving 126. Flop bet 48 (we bet) leaving 78. Call 132 (we called opponent's raise) leaving -? Wait we called 132 after opponent raised to",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to compute stack correctly. Let's recalc:\n\nInitial stack: 206.\n\nBlinds: SB 16, BB 32. So we posted 32, remaining 174.\n\nPreflop: SB raises to 80 (total). We call 48 (to match 80). So we put 48, remaining 126.\n\nFlop: we bet 48, remaining 78. Opponent raises to 180, we call 132 (additional). So we put 132, remaining -? 78-132 = -54, impossible. Means our stack before flop call is larger. Actually after posting BB and preflop call, we have 126. Flop bet 48: we bet 48, leaving 78. Opponent raises to 180, we need to call additional 132 (since we already have 48 in). But we only have 78 left, cannot call 132. So maybe the numbers are relative to pot, not our stack? The pot numbers given may be in chips, but our stack 206 seems low relative to betting amounts (216). Actually we have 206 chips total, but bet 48 on flop, raise 132 call? That exceeds our stack. Something off: maybe the stack is after posting blinds? Let's consider: Starting stack 206 includes blinds? Usually stack includes all chips you have before posting blinds. So after posting BB 32, you have 174. Then you call 48, you have 126. Then you bet 48, you have 78. Then you call 132, you would go all-in with 78, but they say call 132, meaning you had enough. So maybe the stack is larger than 206; perhaps the stack shown is after posting blinds? Actually they list \"Your Stack: 206 chips (6.4 BB)\". Blinds are 16/32, so 32 BB = 1 BB? 206 chips is 6.4 BB, so BB is 32, 6.4*32 = 204.8 approx. So stack is 206 chips total. Yet betting amounts exceed that. Something inconsistent. However we must act based on given legal actions: we can only fold or call. So we cannot raise. So we must decide fold or call.\n\nGiven our stack is low, calling 216 would be all-in (since we only have 206?). Actually amount to call 216 > stack, so calling means we go all-in for remaining chips. In many poker implementations, you can call all-in for less than amount. So we can call with our remaining 206? But they say amount to call 216, maybe we have 206 left, cannot call full, but can go all-in for 206, which is a call of less than required, considered call all-in.\n\nGiven we have top pair but weak kicker, short stack, tournament pressure, we might call to try to double up. Opponent may have stronger Ace (like AK) or two pair. Our chances are low. But we are short stack, need chips. Fold would preserve 206? Actually we have 206 left, folding would keep 206 (since we haven't contributed turn). Wait we already have 206 total, but have contributed earlier bets. Our current stack is maybe less than 206, but they display 206 as remaining stack before turn. So if we fold, we keep 206. If we call, we go all-in and risk losing all. With weak hand, likely fold.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually SB posted 32, BB 64, plus maybe antes? pot 96). We are to act after SB posted 32 (small blind) and BB posted 64. Actually actions: Seat5 post_sb 32, Seat1 post_bb 64. So we are in BTN (but also SB?) Wait seat5 is BTN but also posted SB? Actually BTN is seat5 and also is small blind? Usually BTN is not SB. But here they posted SB 32, so seat5 is SB (maybe they are in SB position). The description says Position: BTN (Seat5). But they posted SB. Possibly they are both BTN and SB due to 2-player? Actually there are many folds, only seat1 BB and seat5 SB (BTN). So they are in the small blind, button is also SB because only two players left? In heads-up, SB is also button. So position is SB (also button). So we are first to act preflop after posting SB. The BB has posted 64, we face 32 to call (to match BB). Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., raise by 96? Actually raise total to 128). Our stack 174, so we can raise to 128 (leaving 46 behind). Or go all-in 174.\n\nHand 7d Qh is not great. With 2.7 BB short stack, need to shove or fold. In heads-up, 7Q offsuit is marginal. But given we are short, we could push all-in to try to steal BB. However we have 2.7 BB, which is borderline for a shove? Typically with <3 BB you push or fold, but with 7Q offsuit maybe push is okay? But we are out of position (SB vs BB). In heads-up, SB is first to act preflop, but after posting, we act first? Actually after posting SB, action goes to BB first preflop (in heads-up). In heads-up, the SB acts first preflop? Wait in heads-up, the dealer is also the small blind, and the big blind acts first preflop? Actually in heads-up, the dealer posts small blind and acts first preflop, then big blind acts second. But here they posted SB then BB, and now it's our turn? The actions list only posts, no further actions. So it's our turn to act? In heads-up, after blinds posted, the SB (dealer) acts first preflop. So we are to act now, facing BB's 64 already in pot, and we have to call 32 to see flop or raise.\n\nGiven 7Q offsuit, short stack, we could shove all-in (174) which is 2.7 BB. That's typical push/fold strategy. Is 7Q a push? According to typical push/fold charts for 2.7 BB in heads-up, you push with any Ace, any pair, broadways, maybe QJ, KQ, etc. 7Q is maybe marginal. Many charts include Q9+, J9+, T9+, 98s etc. 7Q is Q7 offsuit, not strong. Might be a fold. But also we could call 32 (just match BB) and hope to see flop. But with 2.7 BB, calling is not great because we would be out of position post-flop (BB will act first). And we have weak hand.\n\nThus likely fold. But we could consider raising to 128 (min raise) to try to steal. That's a raise, not all-in. But we have only 174 chips, raising to 128 leaves 46 behind, then BB could call or raise. Might be too much.\n\nGiven typical tournament, short stack push/fold: 7Q offsuit is probably a fold. So answer fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have 7c Qh on button with 2.7 BB (174 chips). Blinds 32/64, small blind posted by us? Actually position BTN seat5, but actions show seat5 post_sb 32 (small blind) and seat1 post_bb 64 (big blind). So we are small blind, not button? Wait seat5 is BTN but also posted small blind? In tournament, button posts small blind? Usually button posts small blind if only 2 players? But here seats: seat1 is Kimi-K2 (maybe dealer?), seat5 is us BTN posting small blind. So we are small blind with 7c Qh, stack 174, effective stack after posting 32 is 142 left. To call big blind 64, need to call 32 more (since already posted 32). Pot is 96 (32+64). Minimum raise to 128 means raise total to 128 (i.e., additional 96). With only 174 stack, we could raise to 128 (i.e., put in 96 more). That would be about 1.5 BB raise.\n\nWe need to decide: 7c Qh is a weak hand. In SB with short stack, but still 2.7 BB, we could consider shove all-in? All-in would be 174 total, which is 78 more than raise to 128. But typical strategy with 2.7 BB: push or fold unless you have a hand that can call a raise. Since we are first to act after BB, we can either call 32 more (making 64 total) and see flop, or raise (or shove). With Q7 offsuit, it's not a good call vs potential raise from BB. The BB could have a wide range. Better to just call the blind and hope to see flop cheap? But calling 32 adds 64 total into pot (our 64 vs BB 64). That would be 2 BB invested. Might be okay.\n\nBut with 2.7 BB, many players go all-in or fold. However, Q7 off is not great for a shove; could be dominated. Better to just call and see flop? However, if BB raises, we would be in trouble. But we can then fold.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should just call the BB (i.e., \"call\") and see flop cheap. That's typical.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually pot after preflop: SB 32, BB 64, our call 32 = 128). BB checked, flop: board 8d Jd Jc. So board has paired Jacks, plus 8d. Our hand Qh 7c. We have queen high, no pair, no straight draw (possible 9-10? Actually board: J J 8, we have Q and 7, we have gutshot? We need 10 to make straight J-10-9-8-7? Wait board J J 8, we have Q and 7. Straight possibilities: 10-9-? No, need 9-10 to make J-10-9-8-7? But we have 7, need 9 and 10 to make 7-8-9-10-J, but only one card left. So not. Flush draw? board has two diamonds, we have none. So we have basically queen high, not strong. Opponent is Kimi-K2, stack 672 chips, big stack. He checked flop. We have no reason to bet, but could consider a bluff? However we are short stack: 142 chips left after posting SB and calling? Actually after preflop we have 142 - 32 (SB) - 32 (call) = 78 chips left? Wait stack is 142 chips total at start of hand. After posting SB 32, we have 110 left. Then call 32, leaves 78. So we have 78 chips left. Pot is 128. So we are at 78 chips left, 1.0 BB? Actually 64 is BB, we have 78 chips ~1.2 BB. So we are short stack. We could consider going all-in to try to steal? But board is J J 8, opponent may have a jack, or a set, or a straight draw, or a queen? But checking suggests maybe they missed flop or have weak hand. If we shove, we risk being called by a better hand. But we are short, maybe we need to find a spot to double up. The board is paired Jacks, so many hands will have J, maybe they have a jack, a set, two pair, etc. If they have Jx, they'd likely call. If they have a queen, they'd have top pair, they'd call. If they have a 8, they'd have pair. So likely many will call. But we could try a bluff if they are tight and check. But we have very little equity, and we are out of position? Actually we are on button, we are first to act after flop check. We could check and hope to see turn cheap. Since we have only 78 chips left, we could also consider an all-in raise to 78 (or to total 78? Actually we have 78 chips left, so all-in would be 78. Minimum raise is 64, we can raise to 78 (all-in). Legal actions: raise. Should we raise all-in? Let's think: Pot 128, we have 78, so if we go all-in, pot would be 206 (if called). Opponent has 672 chips, so they can call. Pot odds for opponent: they need to call 78 to win 206, about 38% equity needed. Many hands have >38%? Actually they have Jacks, sets, two pair, etc. Even a single jack has ~33%? But they'd have some equity. So likely they'll call with many hands. Our equity with queen high vs random hand maybe 10-15%. Not good. So better to check and preserve chips for better spot. Since we have 78 chips, we could also consider folding? But we have no bet to call, we can check. So best action is check. So output JSON with action check, raise_to null.\n\n",

Opponent might have J? Or A? Or 8? They could have a hand like AJ, KJ, etc. But they checked, maybe they have weak. Our stack is short, we could try to steal by raising to maybe 128? But we only have 142 total, so raise to all-in 142. Does that make sense? With queen high, unlikely to get called unless opponent is also short and wants to see river. But they could call with any Ace, any Jack, any pair, any straight draw. Likely they have something. Better to check and hope to see river for free, maybe improve? River unknown. But with such short stack, we might consider going all-in to try to double up if opponent folds. But opponent just checked multiple streets, maybe they are passive or have weak. However they are the big blind, maybe they are short-stacked too? Their stack is 672 chips, much larger. So they can call. They may have a hand like Ace high, could call. But they might fold to a shove. Hard to know.\n\nGiven we have only queen high, I think checking is safest. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. We preserve chips for later.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

So we are SB, not BTN? Actually seat5 is BTN but also SB? In a 5-player? Actually seat numbers: seat5 is our seat, and they posted small blind 32. So we are SB. So we are in small blind with 2.2 BB. The big blind posted 64. Pot 96 (SB+BB). We have to act after BB? Actually preflop order: after blinds, action starts with UTG etc but all others folded, so it's just us (SB) then BB. So we are first to act facing BB's 64, we have already posted 32, need to call 32 more to match BB. Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., raise additional 96). Our stack 142, so we could raise to 128 (i.e., total 128). That's a raise of 96 (so we would be putting 128 total). That leaves us with 14 chips left (since we already posted 32, raising to 128 means we need to add 96 more, total 128, leaving 14). That's a very small stack, could be all-in soon.\n\nHand A5 offsuit is weak. With 2.2 BB, we need to decide: fold, call, raise. Usually with such short stack, you might push all-in (raise to 142) or call to see flop. But A5 offsuit is not great, but Ace is strong. However, we are short-stacked; we could try to steal BB by raising all-in, but with only 2.2 BB, it's essentially a push. However, the BB is 64, they have 704 chips, deep stack, they could call. With A5 offsuit, you have about 30% equity vs random hand? Might be okay to push. But also we could just call 32 to see flop and maybe get good flop. However, calling 32 leaves us with 110 chips left after call (since we already posted 32). Actually after call we will have 110 chips left. Then we will be out of position on flop against BB. With A5 offsuit, not great.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, we have low stack, need to survive. A5 offsuit is not premium but Ace can win. I think push (raise all-in) is reasonable. Minimum raise to 128 leaves 14 chips left; could also raise to 142 (all-in). The legal raise is to 128 minimum; can we raise to 142? Yes if allowed, it's an all-in raise. Should we raise to 142? That's full stack. That would be a push.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 142.\n\nReasoning: short stack, need to pick up chips, Ace high gives decent equity, stealing BB possible.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

The raise is all\u2011in (174 total), which is allowed even though it is below the minimum raise amount.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide preflop action with 5h Th in BB, stack 174 (2.7 BB). Blinds 32/64, pot 192 (SB+BB+raise). Seat1 (Kimi) raised to 128 (i.e., raised 64 over BB). Amount to call 64 (to match 128). Minimum raise to 192 (i.e., raise additional 64). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nOur hand 5h Th is a suited Ten with a low kicker. In short stack situation (2.7 BB) we need to consider ICM and survival. 5hTh is not premium; it's a marginal hand. Against a raise from SB (seat1) who appears to raise varying amounts; from recall, they sometimes raise large (e.g., 276, 200) but also small (6, 12). Not clear. Our stack is 174, we have 64 to call, leaving 110 after call. That's about 1.7 BB left. If we call, we will be short-stacked. Could consider going all-in (raise to 174) but raise must be at least 192 (minimum raise), which exceeds our stack; we can go all-in for 174 (which is less than minimum raise, but all-in is allowed if can't meet min raise). So raise all-in is possible.\n\nBut is 5hTh strong enough to shove? At 2.7 BB, typical shoving range includes broadway combos, suited connectors, and maybe T9 suited, but 5hTh is a ten-high suited, not great but could be okay as a semi-bluff if opponent is tight. However, we are out of position (BB vs SB). SB raised, we are in BB (post-flop disadvantage). Usually with such short stack, you either fold or shove if you have enough equity. 5hTh vs unknown range: SB could be raising wide from SB (maybe 2-5% of hands). 5hTh equity vs wide range maybe ~30%? Might be okay to shove.\n\nBut also we have only 174 chips; the pot after call would be 256 (192+64). If we call, we have 110 left, still short. If we call and lose, we are out. If we shove and get called, we could double up.\n\nGiven the short stack, I'd likely shove (raise all-in). However need to check if legal: raise_to must be total amount we put in. All-in is 174 total (including BB 64 already posted). So raise_to = 174? Actually we have already posted 64 BB, plus we need to add 110 to go all-in, total 174. So raise_to = 174.\n\nBut is raise to 174 considered a raise? It's an all-in less than min raise, allowed. So action: raise, raise_to: 174.\n\nReasoning: short stack, marginal hand but decent suited ten, need to pick up chips, opponent's raise size moderate, we can shove to apply pressure.\n\nThus output JSON.",

So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

But position says BTN seat5, but action shows seat5 post_sb 32, seat1 post_bb 64. So we are SB? But position says BTN. Might be mislabel. Anyway we are first to act after blinds? Actually SB posts, then BB posts, then it's our turn (BTN) preflop? But we already posted SB? This is confusing. Probably we are BTN and have posted SB? Actually BTN is seat5, but they posted SB 32. So maybe small blind is seat5, big blind seat1. So we are SB not BTN. Regardless, we are first to act after blinds? In heads-up, SB acts first preflop. So we have to decide action facing a BB of 64, amount to call is 32 (to match BB). Minimum raise is 128 (total). Our stack 238, can raise up to all-in 238.\n\nHand AhTd is decent Ace-high, but short stack 3.7 BB. In tournament short stack, we should look for shove or fold. With 3.7 BB, typical push/fold range includes any Ace, broadway, etc. AhTd is a decent Ace, but is it strong enough to push? With 3.7 BB, you can either call the BB (32) and hope to see flop, but likely you want to either shove or fold. Since we have 238 chips, min raise 128, all-in would be 238. If we call 32, we still have 206 left, but will be in a big blind with only 2 BB left after call? Actually after call, we will have 206 chips, still short. Might be better to push all-in to maximize fold equity. Many short stack strategies: with 3.7 BB, push with any Ace, especially suited? This is unsuited. Still okay.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: only opponent is seat1 with 608 chips. Could be a big stack. Might defend BB with a range. Our push could be called by strong hands. But we want to accumulate chips.\n\nGiven short stack, push all-in (raise to 238). Reasoning: need to either double up or fold; AhTd is decent for push.\n\nLegal actions include raise, so we can raise to 238.\n\nThus output.",

Wait compute: SB posts 32, BB posts 64 = 96. Then SB raises to 128, meaning adds 96 more (since already 32 posted). So total pot = 96 + 128 = 224? Actually after raise, total contributions: SB 128, BB 64 = 192. Yes pot is 192 as given. Amount to call is 64 (to match 128). Minimum raise to 192 (i.e., raise by at least 128 more). Stack 270, can raise to 192 (i.e., add 128). That would be a total bet of 192 from BB, leaving 78 chips left (270-192). That's a raise to 192 total (so raise amount is 128). Pocket pair low, deep? Actually shallow stack, 4.2 BB, so it's a shove or call? Raising to 192 would be about 3 BB (since 192/64=3). That's a big raise, leaving 78 chips, about 1.2 BB left. Could also go all-in for 270. With pocket deuces, we have a set chance if call, but against a raise from SB (likely a strong hand). With 4.2 BB, we could consider shoving all-in (270) to maximize fold equity? But opponent likely raising with a wide range from SB (maybe 3-betting?). Actually SB is the only opponent left; they raised from SB. In BB we have a small pocket pair; we can consider calling (i.e., just match 64) to see flop cheap. But we are deep short; calling 64 leaves 206 chips left, about 3.2 BB. Could be okay. But we need to consider pot odds: call 64 to win 192+64=256? Actually pot before call is 192, we call 64, pot becomes 256. So pot odds = 64/256 = 0.25. Need >25% equity. Pocket deuces vs unknown range? Likely opponent's raise range includes many higher cards; pocket deuces maybe ~5% equity preflop vs typical raise range (maybe 30% of hands). So not enough. So folding is likely best.\n\nBut we could also consider a shove to get fold equity, but with such short stack, raising to 192 (not all-in) may be less effective; opponent could call or re-raise. Better to go all-in? All-in 270 vs opponent's 128 raise; they'd need to call 270? Actually they'd need to call 270-128 = 142 more. That's a big call; they might fold many hands. But with only 4.2 BB, a shove might be okay. However we have low pair; we want to maximize equity by seeing flop cheap, but we have low stack.

Actually seat5 is BTN, but actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 32, Seat1 post_bb 64. So we are small blind, not BTN? Wait seat5 is BTN but they posted small blind? In tournament maybe button is also small blind? But anyway we are forced to post 32, and BB is 64. So we are in the small blind with 3.7 BB stack, have a weak hand (T2 offsuit). We have already posted 32, pot is 96 (SB+BB+?). Actually pot includes our blind and BB: 32+64=96. Amount to call is 32 (to call BB's 64? Actually we need to call 64? The amount to call is 32 because we already posted 32, need to match BB's 64, so call 32 more). Minimum raise to 128 (so raise total to 128). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nGiven our stack is 238, we could raise to 128 (i.e., add 96 more). But with T2, not a good hand. Also short stack. Options: fold, call (go all-in? Actually call is 32 more, leaving us 206 after call). Raise would be aggressive but not advisable.\n\nConsider tournament: short stack 3.7 BB, need to find a spot to double up. But T2 is terrible. Could consider shove all-in (raise to 238) but that's not a legal raise? Minimum raise is 128; we could raise to all-in 238. But is that wise? Probably not.\n\nWe should fold. However we already posted SB; folding means we lose 32. That's okay.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 has raised preflop small amounts (6,14) in previous hands, maybe they are aggressive? But they are BB, likely just raise? Actually they posted BB, not raise. In this hand they haven't acted yet. The only action is BB posted. So we face a bet of 64 (BB). We can call 32 more.\n\nGiven hand is weak, fold.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop in BB with 6s Ks, stack 270, blinds 32/64, pot 128 (SB 32, BB 64, SB called 32). We are in BB, amount to call is 0 (since SB called the BB). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We have 4.2 BB effective stack (270 chips). Hand is K6 offsuit (6s Ks). Not a great hand, but can be playable in short stack scenario. We have 4.2 BB, need to consider ICM? Tournament but early? We have 270 chips vs leader 544, others are out. So we are short-stacked, need to find spots to double up. K6 offsuit is weak; maybe we can attempt a steal? But we are in BB; SB just called, indicating they may be defending the SB with a wide range. Our hand is not strong enough to raise; maybe we can check and see flop, but we have 4.2 BB, could also consider a raise (to 128 min) to try to steal, but risk being called by stronger hand. K6 suited? It's spades, so suited, adds some flush potential. With 4.2 BB, a raise to 128 is a 2x raise (to 128 total) which is about 2 BB (since BB is 64). That's a standard raise. Could we shove? Minimum raise is 128, but we could go all-in for 270 (which is > min raise). However, we have 270, min raise is 128, but raising to 270 is allowed if we have enough chips; it's an all-in. Is that advisable? K6 suited is not a good all-in hand with 4.2 BB. Better to fold or check. Checking gives us a chance to see flop for cheap, but we are out of position post-flop (SB is in front). With 4.2 BB, we may want to pick up chips. However, K6 suited is not a top hand; we could consider folding. But maybe we can try a steal: The SB just called the BB, they might have a weak hand. If we raise, we could isolate and maybe win a small pot. But risk of being called by a stronger hand like AQ, AJ, etc. In short stack, we need to be aggressive but also not waste chips.\n\nGiven we have 270 chips, pot is 128. If we raise to 128 (total), we invest 64 more (since we already have 64 in pot). Actually we have posted BB 64, pot 128 includes SB's 32 and our 64. If we raise to 128, we add 64 more chips, making total pot 192 if called. If called, we will have 64 more in pot, pot ~192, we would be out 128 total. If we lose, we lose 64 more (down to 206). Not huge.\n\nBut we could also go all-in for 270, but that would be a huge overbet. Might be too much.\n\nI think best is to check (fold is not needed because amount to call is 0). Check and see flop. If we get a good flop, we can act.\n\nThus action: check. Reason: weak hand, short stack, not worth raising, better to see flop cheaply.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Opponent (Seat1) has 544 chips, bigger stack.\n\nWe have no pair, no draw: board shows pair of 9s, J, 7. Our hand: King high, 6 kicker. No straight draw? Board: 9-9-J-7. Possible straight draws: 8-10 would give straight, we have 6 and K, not relevant. No flush draws (board suits: d,c,d,h: two diamonds, one club, one heart). We have 6s, Ks (spade). No spade on board, so no flush.\n\nThus we have basically nothing, just king high. Opponent likely has something. They checked on flop and now on turn? Actually we are on turn after flop check. The turn card is 7h, board now 9d 9c Jd 7h. The opponent hasn't acted yet on turn (they will act after us? Actually action order: preflop: seat1 SB, seat5 BB. Flop: seat5 first (BB) then seat1 (SB). Both checked. Turn: seat5 first, then seat1. So we act first on turn. Amount to call is 0, we can check or raise. Minimum raise 64 (to 64 total). Our stack 270, can raise.\n\nGiven we are short stacked and have no showdown value, we should fold or check? If we check, opponent may bet, and we would have to call with nothing, likely lose. Better to maybe try a steal? But we are out of position (BB) but first to act on turn. Our hand is weak; raising could be a bluff, but we have only 4.2 BB, and opponent has 544 chips, likely will call or raise. If we raise to 64 (which is a half-pot?), pot 128, raise to 64 adds 64 to pot (makes pot 192). That's a small raise, might be called. But we could go all-in 270 to try to double up. However our hand is weak, but maybe opponent could fold if they have missed the board. However board is paired 9s, J, 7. Many hands have at least a pair (9) or better. Opponent could have missed. But they have a larger stack, might call with any pair or even overcards. So an all-in is risky.\n\nGiven tournament context, we have 4.2 BB, short stack, need to find spots to double up. This is a good spot to push all-in as a steal, hoping opponent folds. But opponent is the SB, has been checking both flop and turn so far, maybe they are weak. However they could have 9x, Jx, etc. But they might be willing to fold to aggression. Since we are short, we can go all-in. Legal actions include raise, check, fold. We can raise to all-in (270). That's allowed. So best action: raise all-in.\n\nThus output JSON with raise_to 270. Reasoning: short stack, no showdown value, try to double up via bluff.\n\n",

Call is also risky but could be okay if we want to see flop cheap. However we are out of position post-flop vs BB. Short stack, maybe go all-in? Minimum raise to 128 is less than all-in (366). Could go all-in but that is not legal unless we raise to 366 (all-in). But legal actions include raise, we can raise to any amount >= min raise. Might be better to fold, as 5-7 unsuited low is terrible for short stack. Call would be 32 into pot 96, effective stack 366, but we would be out of position and likely dominated. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON.",

The actions: seat5 post_sb 32, seat1 post_bb 64. So seat5 is SB (small blind) not button? But they said Position: BTN (Seat5). Might be mislabel.

So they can call 32 to see flop, or raise to 128, or fold.\n\nGiven stack short 5.7 BB, Qc Kc is a strong hand, especially suited connectors high. In short stack, typical play is to shove all-in (or raise max). Minimum raise is 128, which is about 2 BB raise (to 128 total). With 5.7 BB, a raise to 128 is less than half stack, leaving about 238 chips left. Might be better to go all-in to maximize fold equity. However the legal action only includes raise to any amount? It says raise to total amount. Minimum raise to 128, but can raise higher up to stack? Likely yes. So we could raise to 366 (all-in). That is typical.\n\nBut consider opponent: seat1 Kimi-K2 with 480 chips, likely big stack. In SB, we could shove to put pressure. Qc Kc is good equity vs any random hand.

Wait blinds: 32/64, SB is seat5? But seat5 is BTN, but they posted sb? Possibly seat5 is small blind (maybe seat5 is SB). However actions: seat5 post_sb 32, seat1 post_bb 64. So seat5 is SB, not BTN. But problem says Position: BTN (Seat5). Inconsistent. Probably they are BTN and they posted SB as a dead blind? Actually in tournaments, BTN posts SB when they are also BTN? No. Might be mislabel. Anyway we are first to act after blinds, we are in small blind? Actually SB already posted, BB posted, now action is on seat5? No, seat5 posted sb, seat1 posted bb, now it's seat5's turn to act preflop? Actually after posting blinds, action goes first to UTG (seat2 etc) but they are all folded. So next is seat5 (the BTN) who posted SB? Actually SB acts first preflop. So seat5 is SB, not BTN. So we are in SB with 9s2d, 7.2 BB. Should we fold? Very weak, but short stack, could consider shove (all-in) to try steal? Minimum raise is 128 (to 128 total). Our stack is 462, can raise to 128, but that's a small raise. Might be better to go all-in to apply pressure? Opponent seat1 is BB with 384 chips, could call. With 9-2 offsuit, not good. Should fold.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Call would be 64 more (to match BB) making pot 192. Not good. Raise to 128 (total) is small raise, but could be a bluff. However 9-2 is terrible; short stack, maybe go all-in? But raise to 128 is not all-in. All-in would be 462. That's allowed? Minimum raise to 128, you can raise higher up to your stack. So you could raise all-in. But is that wise? With 7 BB, you could attempt steal but 9-2 is terrible, likely to be called and lose. Better fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

T J is marginal; but with position and short stack, pushing all-in can be okay if opponent folds enough. However opponent is aggressive and may call or re-raise.

No, we have a pair of 4s, board shows 5-6-8, no 4. So we have a set (three of a kind) of fours. That's a strong hand. Opponent (Kimi-K2) is in BB, bet 80 into pot 208 (so pot after bet: 208 + 80 = 288). Our stack 430, we have 350 left after call? Actually we have 430 total, we posted 32 preflop, so remaining 398? Wait stack includes posted blinds? Usually stack shown includes chips after posting? Usually stack shown is current chips before posting? Here they posted 32 SB, but we are BTN, posted SB? Actually we are BTN, but they said \"preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 32\". So they posted small blind. So they are SB, not BTN? But position says BTN seat 5. Might be confusion: they are BTN but posted SB? In some games, BTN posts SB? Actually in 6-max, BTN posts SB? Usually SB is seat left of dealer, but they said position BTN seat5, but they posted SB 32. That suggests they are actually SB (maybe they are seat5, but the dealer is seat4). Anyway, they have posted 32, so their stack after posting is 398. But stack shown 430 maybe pre-blind. Anyway we have about 430 chips total. After call 80, we will have about 350 left. Minimum raise to 160 (i.e., raise total 160). So raise amount would be +80 more than call.\n\nWe have a set, strong hand. Opponent bet 80, likely continuation bet. We can raise for value. But stack is short: 6.7 BB. Opponent likely also short. We should consider opponent's tendencies: recall shows they bet on flop with small amounts (4 and 15) previously. Those were likely small bets maybe with weak hands. Could be they are aggressive? Not many data. But we have a set, we want to extract value but also protect against draws (there is a flush draw: two spades on board, we have no spade, so opponent could have a flush draw). Also straight draws: board 5-6-8, we have 4, so a 7 would give straight. Opponent could have 7x. So we want to raise to charge draws. Minimum raise to 160 is decent. We could also go all-in (430) but that may be too much given opponent's stack unknown but likely similar. Opponent's stack: 304 chips. So we could raise to 304 (all-in). That would be a good move to extract max. But minimum raise is 160, we can raise to any amount up to opponent's stack? Usually raise can be any amount >= min raise. So we could raise all-in 304. That would be good to protect and get value. However, is there risk of being called by a bigger hand? Our set is likely best. So go all-in.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. So we can raise to 304 (all-in). Provide reasoning.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: we are BTN with pocket 44 on board 5c6s8sT. Board is rainbow? Actually 5c,6s,8s,Ts: two spades (6s,8s) and clubs, clubs. Our hand 44 is a pocket pair, currently middle pair (fourth pair). No straight draw? Board: 5-6-8-10. Straight possibilities: 7 gives 6-7-8-9-10? Actually need 9 as well. No. 4 gives 4-5-6-? need 7? Not. So our 44 is just a pair, likely weak. Pot 736. Stack 126 (2 BB). We are very short-stacked. Opponent (Seat1) checked to us on turn. We have 0 to call. Options: check (which would be a check-raise maybe later) or fold (but can't fold when no bet). Actually legal actions: fold, check. But folding would forfeit hand. Since we have 0 to call, checking is the only viable. But we could also consider going all-in? No, raise not legal (minimum raise 224 > our stack). So only check.\n\nWe need reasoning: Very short stack, weak hand, no equity, can't raise, checking may get us to river maybe get showdown if opponent checks again. But opponent may bet river; we have poor showdown value. So maybe we should check and hope to see river cheap? But we have no chips left to call any bet >0; we are at 126 chips total, but we already posted 32+32? Actually we posted 32 sb, called 32 preflop, plus raised 304 on flop (but that was from our stack). Wait stack after flop: Starting 126, posted sb 32, call 32 (so 62 left?), Actually posting sb is 32, then call 32 = 64 total, leaving 62. Then we raised 304 on flop, but we only have 62 left, so we must have gone all-in? But the raise amount is 304, which exceeds stack. Something inconsistent: maybe our stack was 126 after posting sb? Actually typical tournament: you post sb 32, you have 126 chips total (including sb). So after posting sb, remaining 94. Then call 32 (so total 64) leaving 62. Then raise 304? Can't. So maybe the raise is not from us? Wait actions: flop: Seat1 bet 80, Seat5 raise 304, Seat1 call 224. So we raised to 304 total (i.e., we added 304-80=224). That would be a raise of 224 from us, but we only have 62 left. Something off. Possibly the stack numbers are after posting sb? Actually the \"Your Stack: 126 chips (2.0 BB)\" maybe is after posting sb? But then you posted sb 32, leaving 94. Then you call 32, leaving 62. Then raise 304? impossible. So maybe the numbers are not consistent; maybe the raise is a bet of 304 total, but we are all-in? But then we would be all-in for 62, not 304. So maybe the stack is larger earlier but after flop we have more chips due to some other? Or perhaps the raise is from opponent? But actions say seat5 raise 304. Could be that the stack shown is after the raise? Actually after raise we would be at 0 chips (all-in). But stack shown still 126. Something contradictory.\n\nGiven the tool, we must follow legal actions: only fold or check. So we must check. Reasoning: short stack, weak hand, cannot raise, check to see river.\n\nThus output JSON.",

Wait position BTN seat 5, we are BTN but also posted SB? The actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 32, Seat1 post_bb 64. So we are SB, not BTN? Actually position says BTN (Seat5) but we posted SB because BTN is also SB? In 2-player? Actually only two players left: seat1 (BB) and seat5 (SB). So we are SB with 126 chips, posted 32, left 94. Big blind 64 posted, left 62. Pot currently 96 (32+64). Amount to call is 32 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 128 total (i.e., raise 96 more). But we have only 94 chips left after posting SB, so we cannot raise to 128 (needs 96). So we can either go all-in (call 32 then all-in 94 total) or just call (call 32) or fold. Hand is 6s8s, suited connectors, low. With effective stack 2 BB, it's a marginal hand. Consider tournament: short stack 2 BB, need to double up. Raising all-in could be good if we think opponent may fold? But they are BB, they already have 64 invested. If we go all-in, total pot would be 96 + our remaining 94 = 190? Actually we have 94 left after posting SB, call 32 uses 32, leaving 62, then can go all-in additional 62 for total 94? Wait we have total 126, posted 32, remaining 94. To call 32 we put 32 more, leaving 62. To go all-in we would put remaining 62, making total contribution 94. So final pot would be 96 + 94 = 190. Raise to 128 is not possible, so all-in is a raise.\n\nConsider opponent: BB with 720 chips, deep stack relative. Likely they will defend with a wide range vs SB. Our hand 6-8 suited is not strong enough for a shove? With 2 BB effective, typical push/fold range from SB includes many hands like any pair, suited connectors, etc. 6-8 suited is decent. Might be okay to shove.\n\nBut we must consider that we are short stack and need to double up. Our hand has some equity vs typical BB defending range (maybe 30%). Could be okay.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Raise would be all-in (since cannot meet min raise). So we can raise.\n\nThus decision: raise (all-in). Provide reasoning.",

Actually actions listed: preflop: seat1 post sb 32, seat5 post bb 64, seat1 call 32, seat5 check. So after flop, SB acted? Not listed. Probably SB hasn't acted yet.

So we are low on chips, need to survive.\n\nGiven we are short, we might consider shove all-in (raise to 158) to try to steal or get value if opponent has worse. But we have a pair, but opponent may have J, or overcards. If they have J, they'd have top pair, they'd call. If they have 2, they'd have pair of twos. If they have something else, they'd maybe fold.\n\nGiven we have 2.5 BB, typical strategy is to go all-in with any pair? But risk of being called by J or better. However we are short and need to accumulate.\n\nCheck? If we check, opponent may bet and we will be forced to call with weak hand, risking elimination. Better to shove now to either win pot or get all-in.\n\nThus raise to 158 (all-in). Legal? Minimum raise is 64, we have 158.

Now I only beat bluffs and some weaker pairs. The Kc also completes potential flush draws and gives many hands that beat me.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nNo specific history with MiniMax-M2, but their line (call flop, bet big turn) suggests strength. They likely have:\n- A King (making top pair)\n- A flush draw that got there\n- Two pair or a set\n- A straight draw that improved\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n74 to call into 133 pot = ~35% equity needed. With just Jacks here facing this action, I likely don't have enough equity.\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\nI have 175 chips left. Calling 74 would leave me with 101 chips, committing a significant portion of my stack with a marginal holding.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The King on turn is a terrible card for pocket Jacks.

The Qd gives me additional outs to a straight.\n\n2. **Opponent Profile**: Seat 1 has been relatively tight, folding most hands preflop and only playing a few. They called my flop raise, which suggests they have something decent.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes**: I have 89 chips left and the pot is 178 chips. I'm pot-committed if I continue.\n\n4. **Board Texture**: The board is very coordinated with potential straights and flushes. My opponent could have:\n   - A straight (they have a Jack for the nuts)\n   - Two pair or a set\n   - A strong draw that they called with\n\n5. **Previous Pattern**: In hand #5, I had JJ and check-folded the turn after betting the flop. This opponent might see me as capable of firing multiple barrels.\n\n**Decision**: This is a great spot to check. The turn card (Qd) is scary for my hand as it completes more straights, and my opponent called a significant flop raise. Checking allows me to:\n- Control the pot size\n- See a free river card\n- Avoid getting raised and being forced to fold my equity\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking to control pot size and see free river.

Now I only beat bluffs and some weaker pairs. The Kc also completes potential flush draws and gives many hands that beat me.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nNo specific history with MiniMax-M2, but their line (call flop, bet big turn) suggests strength. They likely have:\n- A King (making top pair)\n- A flush draw that got there\n- Two pair or a set\n- A straight draw that improved\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n74 to call into 133 pot = ~35% equity needed. With just Jacks here facing this action, I likely don't have enough equity.\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\nI have 175 chips left. Calling 74 would leave me with 101 chips, committing a significant portion of my stack with a marginal holding.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"The King on turn is a terrible card for pocket Jacks.

My opponent could have:\n   - A straight (they have a Jack for the nuts)\n   - Two pair or a set\n   - A strong draw that they called with\n\n5. **Previous Pattern**: In hand #5, I had JJ and check-folded the turn after betting the flop. This opponent might see me as capable of firing multiple barrels.\n\n**Decision**: This is a great spot to check. The turn card (Qd) is scary for my hand as it completes more straights, and my opponent called a significant flop raise.

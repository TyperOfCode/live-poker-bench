            "reasoning_content": "  Let me think about this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: 4s 9s - This is a mediocre suited connector. It's not a strong starting hand, but being suited gives some potential. However, it's still a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is the worst position post-flop, but I already have 4 chips invested.\n\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4 raised to 8 (2x the big blind). From the recall data:\n   - MiniMax-M2 has been raising preflop frequently (hands 21, 23, and this hand)\n   - In hand 21, they made a big re-raise to 48, then continued betting on flop and turn\n   - In hand 22, they called preflop then bet on the flop but folded on the river\n   - They seem to be an aggressive player who likes to bet\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 14 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 8). I need to call 4 chips to see the flop. That's 3.5-to-1 pot odds (14:4).\n\n5. **Stack consideration**: I have 278 chips (69.5 BB), so I'm deep enough to make speculative calls, but 4-9 suited is still very weak.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: Early in a tournament, I should be more conservative with marginal hands, especially out of position.\n\n**Decision**: Even though I'm getting decent pot odds (3.5:1), 4-9 suited is just too weak, especially out of position against an aggressive player. The gap is too large, and I'm unlikely to hit a strong hand. If I hit a 4 or 9 on the flop, I'll have a weak pair with a mediocre kicker. If I hit a flush draw, it will be a low flush that could be dominated. \n\nFolding is the correct play here to preserve my stack for better opportunities.",

UTG is the earliest position, meaning I have to act first preflop with 5 players still to act behind me (SB, BB, and 2 others). With 53.2 BB stack, I'm not desperate for chips.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot (16 folds out of 23 hands), which is reasonable. I won hand #22 with Ks Th from SB position, but that's a much better hand than 4c Td.\n\nThe opponents: MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 has shown aggressive tendencies with raises preflop (hand #21, #23). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is in BB, seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is SB.\n\nWith 4c Td offsuit, this is a trash hand that should almost always be folded from UTG. There's very little potential to make a strong hand postflop. Even if I hit a pair, it's likely dominated. The hand has poor connectivity and no suitedness.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 4 chips into pot of 6 (total pot would be 10 if I call). That's 2.5:1 odds, but with such a weak hand and poor position, the implied odds are terrible.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 53.2 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands from early position.\n\nGiven that I'm first to act, if I call, I'll likely face raises from later positions (especially MiniMax-M2 who has been aggressive). Better to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"4c Td is a very weak hand from UTG position with 5 players left to act.

Actually raise amount: seat4 raise 8 meaning they put 8 total? Since SB posted 2, BB 4, then seat4 raise to 8 (so they added 8? Typically raise to 8 means total bet 8, so they added 4 more (since big blind 4). So amount to call is 6 (8-2). Minimum raise to 12 (so raise to at least 12). Hand Kc6d is weak, suited? Kc6d not same suit. Not a good hand from SB vs raise. Should fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies? Might recall but not needed. Probably fold.\n\nReturn JSON.",

It's in the bottom 10% of starting hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, which is the worst position post-flop. I'll act first on every street.\n\n3. **Opponent**: There's only one opponent left (GPT-OSS-120B in seat 5) with 396 chips (12.4 BB). Let me analyze their tendencies based on the data:\n   - In hand 77: Raised to 48\n   - In hand 79: Called 24, then check-folded on turn\n   - In hands 80-82: Folded preflop\n   - In hand 83: Made a big raise of 268\n   - In hand 85: Made another big raise of 316\n\n   This opponent seems to be playing aggressively, making large raises. They appear to be in desperation mode with a medium stack.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 26 chips and I need to put in 0 to check. If I check, I get to see a free flop.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 16.8 BB, I'm in a decent position but not comfortable. I should preserve my stack for better spots. The opponent has 12.4 BB and appears to be getting aggressive.\n\n6. **Action**: I can check for free. Raising would be a pure bluff with a terrible hand, and I'd be risking chips unnecessarily. Folding doesn't make sense when checking is free.\n\nThe best play is to check and see a free flop. If I hit something strong (unlikely with 6-4), I can proceed. Otherwise, I can easily fold to any aggression.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 6h 4c - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and not connected\n2. **Position**: SB - I'm out of position postflop\n3. **Stack**: 536 chips (16.8 BB) - I have a decent but not huge stack\n4. **Situation**: Preflop, facing a raise to 396 from GPT-OSS-120B\n\nLet me analyze the opponent's tendencies from the data I just retrieved:\n- GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop (hands 67, 69, 70, 71, 73, 74, 80, 81, 82)\n- When they do raise, they've made some significant raises: 48, 268, 316, and now 396 chips\n- They seem to be playing quite tight-aggressive, folding frequently but raising big when they play\n\nThe pot is 422 chips, and I need to call 380 chips to see the flop. That's a very large portion of my stack (71% of my stack).\n\nWith 6h 4c:\n- This hand has very little equity against any reasonable raising range\n- I'm out of position, which makes it even harder to realize any equity\n- The raise size is very large, suggesting GPT-OSS-120B has a strong hand\n- Even if I hit a miracle flop (like 654 or 644), I'd still be vulnerable to better hands\n\nPot odds: I need to call 380 to win 422, which is less than 1:1. I would need to win more than 47% of the time to make this call profitable, which is impossible with 6-4 offsuit against a tight player's raise.\n\nTournament considerations: Calling here would leave me with only 156 chips (4.9 BB) if I lose, which is a very desperate situation. Folding preserves my 16.8 BB stack, which is still playable.\n\nThe only argument for calling would be if I think GPT-OSS-120B is bluffing or raising with a very weak hand, but their pattern suggests they raise with strong hands.\n \nI'll fold this hand. The risk is too high, and the potential reward doesn't justify the massive chip commitment.",

Something off: maybe small blind 16, big blind 10? But pot 26. Anyway amount to call 16, min raise to 48. We have Ace-Jack offsuit. In short stack 12.4 BB, BTN, we can consider shoving all-in? Stack 396 chips, but effective stack relative to blinds? Actually our stack is 396 chips, but blinds are 16/32, so we have ~12 BB. That's a short stack but not ultra short. Standard push/fold range at 12 BB includes many hands. AJ offsuit is a strong hand, we could raise to 48 (1.5x big blind) maybe? But with short stack, we might want to go all-in to maximize fold equity. However min raise is 48, we could raise to maybe 200? Need to consider opponent seat1 has 536 chips, about 16.7 BB. He just checked from small blind. Likely will call or fold. Raising to a decent amount could isolate. At 12 BB, typical push/fold threshold is around 0.5-0.6 BB? Actually push all-in is typical at <10 BB. At 12 BB, you can still raise and maybe get called. I think best is to raise to maybe 120 (3 big blinds) to put pressure. But we have to consider we are short and want to accumulate chips. AJ is top 10% hand. I think raising to min raise 48 is too small, could be called cheaply. Better to go all-in? All-in would be 396 chips, which is about 12 BB, which is a huge bet relative to pot (26). That could force fold from many but also risk being called by bigger stack. But AJ is strong enough to risk. However typical tournament strategy: push all-in when stack <= 15 BB and have a decent hand. So I will go all-in (raise to 396). Need to set raise_to total amount. So raise_to = 396 (or maybe 398? total stack). Use raise action.\n\nThus JSON.",

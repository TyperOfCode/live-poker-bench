Despite their recent tight play, this could be a steal attempt or a trap with a premium hand. The pot odds look superficially attractive, but the hand's poor quality and positional disadvantage make calling a losing proposition. I'll fold and wait for a better spot to invest my chips.",

With K4o, this is a clear fold from UTG. The hand has very little potential - it's offsuit, not connected, and the king is weak with a 4 kicker. Even if I hit a king, I could be dominated by better kickers.\n\nGiven my stack size (96.5 BB), I should be playing tight from early position and preserving chips. The blinds are small relative to my stack, so there's no pressure to play marginal hands.\n\nAlso, looking at my recent history, I've been folding a lot (13 folds out of 19 hands), which is fine - I should be playing tight in a tournament.\n\nI should fold this hand and wait for a better spot from better position or with stronger cards."

I have 193 chips (96.5 BB), so I'm deep stacked relative to blinds.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB) has shown some aggression with raises to 6 in previous hands (hands 14 and 18).\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has been calling and betting post-flop.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB) has been folding a lot recently but showed aggression in hand 13 with a raise to 30.\n\nMy position is UTG, which is the worst position at the table. With K4o, this is a clear fold from UTG. The hand has very little potential - it's offsuit, not connected, and the king is weak with a 4 kicker. Even if I hit a king, I could be dominated by better kickers.\n\nGiven my stack size (96.5 BB), I should be playing tight from early position and preserving chips. The blinds are small relative to my stack, so there's no pressure to play marginal hands.\n\nAlso, looking at my recent history, I've been folding a lot (13 folds out of 19 hands), which is fine - I should be playing tight in a tournament.\n\nI should fold this hand and wait for a better spot from better position or with stronger cards.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand carefully. I have Ace of clubs and 6 of hearts (Ac 6h) in the button position. I'm looking at the action so far:\n\n- Seat 5 posted the small blind (1 chip)\n- Seat 1 posted the big blind (2 chips) \n- Seat 3 folded\n- I called the big blind (2 chips)\n- Seat 5 raised to 4 chips\n- Seat 1 folded\n\nNow I need to decide what to do. The amount to call is 2 chips (to match the raise), and the minimum raise would be to 6 chips total.\n\nLooking at the opponent history for GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5), I can see:\n- They've been mostly folding preflop (folds in hands 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19)\n- In hand 13, they called 2 and then raised to 30 (quite large), then bet 80 on the flop\n- In hand 15, they checked preflop and on flop, then folded on turn\n\nSo this opponent seems to be playing fairly tight, but when they do raise, they can be quite aggressive (hand 13 showed a big 3-bet and continuation bet).\n\nWith Ac 6h, I have Ace high, which is actually a decent hand. While the 6 is low, having the Ace gives me good potential. I'm in position (button), which is advantageous.\n\nLet me think about the math:\n- Pot is currently 8 chips\n- I need to call 2 more to see the flop\n- If I raise to 6, that would be a 3x raise over the big blind\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have Ace high with good kicker potential\n2. I'm in position \n3. This opponent seems to play tight but can be aggressive when they have hands\n\n\n4. I have a decent stack (201 chips = 100.5 BB)\n5. The raise size is relatively small (only 2 chips to call)\n\nI'll likely call to see the flop. The small raise size and my positional advantage make calling an attractive option. My Ace provides strength, and I'm getting a good price to continue in the hand. The opponent's tight-aggressive style means they might have a premium hand, but I'm not scared off by that.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. My hand: Ac 6h on board 5s 6s 9d\n   - I have middle pair (6s) with Ace kicker\n   - I have one pair, which is decent but not strong\n   - The board has two spades, so there could be flush draws\n\n2. Opponent analysis:\n   - GPT-OSS-120B bet 6 chips into a 16-chip pot\n   - From my recall, I only see one previous flop bet from this opponent (80 chips in hand #13)\n   - Limited data on this specific opponent's betting patterns\n\n3. My position and stack:\n   - I'm on the button (BTN) with 199 chips (99.5 BB)\n   - This is a decent stack size, not short stacked yet\n   - Position is good as I act last\n\n4. Pot odds:\n   - Pot is 16 chips, bet is 6 chips to call\n   - Pot odds are about 2.7:1, which is decent\n\n5. Tournament considerations:\n   - This is hand #20, so we're in the middle stages\n   - My stack is still healthy at ~100BB\n   - I need to balance preservation with chip accumulation\n\n6. Hand strength assessment:\n   - I have one pair (6s) with Ace kicker\n   - This is middle pair on a relatively dry board\n   - Not strong enough to raise for value, but good enough to call\n   - If the opponent has a better pair or a set, I'm behind\n   - If they have worse hands or draws, I'm ahead\n\nGiven the pot odds and my hand strength, I think calling is the best option here. I have middle pair which has decent showdown value, and I'm getting good odds to call. The board isn't too scary (no obvious straights or flushes), so I can reasonably expect to win if I pair my Ace or if my 6 is good.\n \nA fold feels premature when my hand has reasonable potential. The pot odds suggest staying in the hand is strategically sound, especially with my middle pair and Ace kicker providing some flexibility.",

This is a decent hand but not super strong.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: \n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is the only remaining opponent\n- They bet 6 on the flop, I called\n- Now they check on the turn\n- This could indicate weakness or they might be trapping\n\n**Tournament Considerations**:\n- Stack is 193 chips, so we're at about 96.5 BB\n- This is a comfortable stack size where I can make moves\n\n**Options**:\n1. Check - maintain pot control, see river\n2. Bet - value bet with top pair, could get called by worse hands\n3. Fold - too weak to continue\n\nGiven that:\n- I have top pair with a good kicker (A6)\n- Opponent checked on turn (showing weakness)\n- I'm in position\n- Pot is only 22 chips, so betting is not too expensive\n\nI think checking is the best play here. I can see the river and potentially get to showdown cheaply, or if the opponent bets, I can make a decision then. Betting could also be reasonable to get value from worse hands, but checking seems more prudent given the board texture with potential flush draws.",

Actually SB posted 1, BB 2, seat4 called 2, so SB to act after seat4? The order: SB first posted 1, then BB posted 2, seat3 folded, seat4 called 2, now it's SB's turn, amount to call is 1 (to match BB's 2). So we can call 1, raise min to 4 total (i.e., raise 3 more). Hand Ah7s is a decent suited ace but low kicker. In SB, with 112.5 BB stack, we can consider raising to isolate. Opponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called BB, unknown tendencies. Seat1 is BB with 370 chips (big stack). He hasn't acted yet? Actually BB already posted 2, but hasn't acted preflop after seat4. In SB, after SB posts, BB posts, then UTG etc. But here seats: seat5 SB, seat1 BB, seat4 called, now SB acts. Actually order: SB first, then BB, then seat3 (UTG?) folded, seat4 (CO?) called, now it's SB again? Wait typical order: preflop action starts with UTG (seat after BB). But here we have only 3 players left: SB (seat5), BB (seat1), seat4 (seat4). The order after blinds: first player after BB is seat2 (folded), seat3 (folded), seat4 (call), seat5 (SB) already posted and is first to act? Actually SB posts before action, then first to act is UTG (seat2), then seat3, seat4, seat5 (SB) is last to act preflop. So SB acts last preflop. So we face a call of 1 to match BB's 2 (and seat4's 2). So we can raise.\n\nGiven Ah7s suited, it's a decent hand for a raise in SB to steal blinds and maybe isolate. But opponent seat4 just called, likely a wide range. BB seat1 hasn't acted yet; they have big stack and may 3-bet.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call, raise. With Ace-high suited, raising is typical to apply pressure and get value. Minimum raise to 4 total means raise 3 more (so total contribution becomes 4). That would be a raise of 2x the big blind (since BB is 2). That's a standard raise.\n\nConsider stack sizes: we have deep stack, can raise bigger but min is 4. Could also go all-in? No need.\n\nThus raise to 4 seems good.\n\nReasoning: Hand strength moderate, suited ace, position disadvantage but we can raise to steal, isolate. Also opponent seat4 called, likely wide, could fold to raise. BB may 3-bet, but we can fold if 3-bet.\n\nThus action: raise to 4.\n\nReturn JSON.",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with Ah7s. Board: 5s 6s 9d. So we have a flush draw (two spades on board, we have spade 7, plus Ace spade, so we have Ace-high flush draw, plus open-ended straight draw? Board 5-6-9, we have 7, so we have 5-6-7, need 8 for straight, also have Ace for gutshot? Actually 5-6-7, need 8 to make 5-6-7-8-9 straight, we have 9 on board, so we need 8 for straight. So we have both a flush draw and a gutshot? Actually we have 7s, board 5s6s9d. With 7s, we have 5-6-7, need 8 for straight. Also we have Ace spade for flush draw (need any spade). So we have strong draw.\n\nStack 222 chips. Pot 10 chips. Opponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) called preflop and is now in the hand. It's flop, amount to call 0 (since no bet). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 2. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies from recall: Past flop actions: He sometimes checks, sometimes calls, sometimes bets (hand 8). In 9 flops, he checked 4 times, called 4 times, bet once (6 chips). So mixed. He may be passive.\n\nWe are in BB, out of position vs him (he is MP? Actually seat 4 is left of us? Seat order: seat 5 is BB, seat 4 is before us (to our right). So he's in early position (UTG?). Actually seat numbers: 1 is SB, 2 is BB? Wait blinds: seat1 posted sb 1, seat5 posted bb 2? Actually preflop: seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So seat4 is MP maybe. Anyway we are SB? Actually seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB (small blind). So we are out of position after flop (SB is first to act). So we act first.\n\nWe have strong draw, want to build pot and maybe protect. Raising could make him fold weaker hands, or give us money if he calls. Since pot is small, raising to 2 (minimum) is good. Could also raise more to protect against draws. Our stack is deep relative to pot (222 vs 10). But tournament stage? Not given, but we have 111 BB, deep stack. So we can be aggressive.\n\nConsider opponent's range: He called preflop raise from SB (our raise to 4). He likely has a broad range: maybe suited connectors, pairs, etc. The board 5s6s9d hits many hands: 6x, 5x, spade draws, straight draws. He may have a made hand like 9x, 6x, 5x, maybe two pair, etc. Raising could isolate and get value if he has a made hand, but also could be called by draws.\n\nGiven we have strong draws, we could semi-bluff raise. Minimum raise to 2 is small, but we could raise to maybe 6? But legal raise minimum is 2 (total). We can raise to any amount up to our stack, but typical is 2-4. Since pot is 10, raising to 6 (i.e., bet 6) would be 0.6 pot, decent.\n\nBut we need to consider opponent's likely reaction: He has called preflop, so he may call our flop raise often. If we raise to 6, he'll call with many draws, but we still have equity.\n\nGiven tournament, preserving stack is okay. I'd raise to maybe 6 chips (total). Provide reasoning.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 6.\n\n",

Suits: we have Ah (hearts) and 7s (spades). Board has two spades (5s,6s). So we have a nut flush draw? Actually we have one spade, need two more spades for flush. There are two spades on board, we have one spade, so need two more spades on river to make flush, which is impossible (only one card left). So no flush draw. Straight draw? Board: 5-6-9-5. We have A7. Could we have a gutshot? 7 with 5-6 gives 5-6-7, need 8 for straight. Not present. 5-6-7-8-9 would be straight but need 8 and 9, we have 9 on board, need 8 on river to complete straight (5-6-7-8-9). That's an open-ended? Actually we have 5-6 on board, we have 7, need 8 to complete. That's a gutshot? No, we have 5-6-7, need 8-9 to complete? Wait a straight of 5-6-7-8-9 uses 5,6,7,8,9. We have 5,6,9 on board, 7 in hand, missing 8. So we need exactly 8 on river to make straight. That's a single-card draw (one-out). Also we have Ace high, maybe pair? No pair. So hand currently: A high, with gutshot draw to straight (8). Also possible backdoor flush? We have hearts Ace, board has no hearts, so no.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 is on the button? Actually seat 4. They called preflop raise, flop they called bet 6. Turn they bet 8. So they are showing aggression.\n\nPot size before turn bet: after flop, pot 30? Actually pot after flop: Preflop pot: 1+2+2+4+2? Let's compute: Preflop: seat5 posted sb 1, seat1 posted bb 2, seat4 call 2, seat5 raise 4 (so adds 4, total seat5 contributed 1+4=5?), seat1 fold, seat4 call 2 (so seat4 contributed 2+2=4). So preflop pot = 1+2+2+4+2 =11? Actually raise 4 means they put total 4? Usually raise to 4 means total bet 4 (including sb). So seat5 contributed 4 total, seat4 contributed 4 total (2 call + 2 call). So pot = 1+2+4+4 =11? Not sure but given pot on flop is 30 chips as per description. So after flop betting 6 each, pot becomes 30. Turn: seat5 check, seat4 bet 8. So pot before turn bet = 30. After seat4 bet 8, pot will be 38 if called, 30+8 =38. Amount to call 8. So pot odds: call 8 to win pot 38+8? Actually if call, you add 8, pot becomes 46 (30+8+8). So pot odds = 8/(46) = 17.4%. Need about 17% equity. Our chance: we have one-out (8). There are 46 unseen cards? Actually we have seen: our 2 cards, board 4 cards =6 known. Opponent unknown 2? Actually opponent has 2 unknown cards, but we consider outs ignoring opponent's cards. So remaining deck: 52-6 =46. Out of 46, one card (8) gives us straight. Also maybe other outs? If opponent has a pair, we could still have Ace high? Not enough. So only 1 out. Probability to hit on river = 1/46 \u2248 2.2%. That's far below pot odds 17%. So calling is not profitable. Could we raise? Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total bet 16). Raising would be even worse. So we should fold.\n\nBut consider tournament context: we have 216 chips, opponent 185 chips. Our stack is larger. Our hand is weak. Fold is correct.\n\nThus output JSON with action fold, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Turn bet from MiniMax-M2 (Seat4) of 8 into pot 30 (now 38 after turn bet? Actually pot before turn: after flop, pot was 30 (preflop 4+2+2=8, flop bet 6+6=12, total 20? Wait compute: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, MiniMax call 2, BB raise 4 (so BB put 4 total? Actually BB posted 2 blind, then raise to 4 means additional 2? Usually raise to 4 total, so BB contributed 4. MiniMax call 2 additional (since already 2 in pot). So preflop pot: SB 1, BB 4, MiniMax 4? Actually MiniMax posted 2 blind? No, MiniMax is seat4, posted 2 (call) after BB raise. So total preflop: 1+4+2=7? But action says seat4 call 2 (so they put 2). So pot 1+4+2 =7. Then flop: BB bet 6, MiniMax call 6, adds 12, pot now 19. Turn: BB check, MiniMax bet 8, pot now 27? Actually before turn bet, pot 19, then MiniMax bet 8, now pot 27 (including his 8). So we face 8 bet into 19 pot, pot odds 8/(19+8)=8/27\u224829.6% needed. Our hand A7 is weak. No showdown value. Could we consider a bluff raise? We have 108 BB, deep stack, but opponent's behavior: they bet on turn often (multiple times). In recall, they bet 74 on turn in hand5 (big), bet 6 on turn in hand15 (small), bet 8 on turn hand16 (like this), bet 24 on turn hand19. So they are aggressive on turn, possibly semi-bluffing with draws. Board has a possible flush draw (two spades on board, we have one spade, they could have spade draw). Also paired board, could have full house. Our A7 is not strong. Likely fold. So action fold.\n\nReturn JSON.",

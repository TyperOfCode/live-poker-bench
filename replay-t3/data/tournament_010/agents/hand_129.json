This suggests they have a strong hand.\n\nMy hand Q7o is very weak. Even against a short stack, calling 174 chips (28.6% of my stack) with Q7o is not profitable. \n\nPot odds: I need to call 174 to win 302, so I'm getting about 1.7:1 pot odds. I would need about 37% equity to call. Q7o typically has much less equity against any reasonable raising range.\n\nWith 9.5 BB, I need to be very selective with my hands. Q7o is a clear fold in this situation, especially against an opponent who has shown they raise with strong hands (given their fold-heavy pattern).\n\nDecision: Fold",

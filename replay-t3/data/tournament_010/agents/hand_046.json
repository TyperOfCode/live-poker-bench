Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 218, which is an all-in since they have 0 chips? Wait, Seat 5 has 0 chips and is marked as \"out\". That seems odd. Maybe they're already out of the tournament? Actually, looking at the players: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). So they're out of the tournament, but somehow they raised? That doesn't make sense. Perhaps it's a mistake in the display. Let me read carefully: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out)\". Yet the action says \"Seat 5 raise 218\". That seems contradictory. Maybe they had 218 chips and went all-in? But it says 0 chips. Hmm.\n\nAnyway, the pot is 230 chips. Seat 1 folded. I'm Seat 3 (button). I posted SB 4, Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted BB 8. Then Seat 5 raised to 218. I need to call 214 to win a pot of 230 + 218 = 448? Wait, let's calculate: Pot before Seat 5's raise: SB 4 + BB 8 = 12. Seat 5 raised to 218 total, which means they added 210 more (since BB is 8, they need to raise at least to 16, but they raised huge). The pot after their raise: 4 (SB) + 8 (BB) + 218 = 230. That matches the pot listed: 230 chips. So I need to call 214 (since I already put in 4 as SB). If I call, I put in 214 more, making total pot 230 + 214 = 444. But actually, Seat 4 (BB) still hasn't acted. They will act after me. They have 226 chips. They could call or fold.\n\nMy hand: 4d8d suited. Very weak hand. Facing a huge raise that looks like an all-in (though Seat 5 has 0 chips? Maybe they're all-in with 218 and have 0 left). The raise is 27.25 BB (218/8). That's a massive raise, typically indicating a very strong hand. With 4d8d, I should almost certainly fold. However, I need to consider pot odds. I need to call 214 to win 230. That's about 1.07:1 odds, meaning I need about 48% equity. 4d8s vs a strong range has maybe 30% equity at best. So fold.\n\nBut wait, there's also Seat 4 behind me who could call or raise. If I call, they might also call or raise. That could change pot odds. However, with such a weak hand, I should fold.\n\nI should also consider tournament situation: I have 250 chips (31.2 BB). That's healthy. No need to gamble with 4d8d.\n\nLet me check if there's any history on Seat 5's behavior. Use recall_opponent_actions for Seat 5.",

But the action says Seat 5 raise 218. That seems contradictory. Let me check the player list again: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). Yet the action says \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 218\". That would be impossible if they have 0 chips. Maybe it's a misprint or they had chips earlier? The pot is 230 chips, which suggests SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 218 = 230. So indeed Seat 5 raised 218 total.\n\nBut Seat 5 is shown as having 0 chips and \"out\". Perhaps they went all-in on a previous hand and lost, but this is a new hand? Or maybe the \"out\" means they're sitting out? Let me re-read: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out)\". Could mean they're out of the tournament, but then they wouldn't be able to raise. Possibly a display error.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide: fold or call with 4d8d. I have to call 214 chips to win a pot of 230 + my call 214 = 444 total. So I'm getting about 2.07:1 pot odds (444/214). My stack is 250, calling 214 leaves me with 36 chips if I lose. That's desperate.\n\nHand strength: 4d8d suited is a weak hand. Against a huge raise like this, likely a strong hand. Could be a pair, high cards, maybe AK, AQ, JJ+, etc. My equity against a reasonable range is poor.\n\nTournament situation: I have 31.2 BB, which is okay but not deep. Losing this would cripple me to 4.5 BB. However, doubling up would give me 500 chips (62.5 BB). Risk vs reward.\n\nBut wait, Seat 5 has 0 chips? That's confusing. If they actually have 0 chips, their raise is invalid. Maybe they have 218 chips but display shows 0? Let me search for observations about Seat 5.\n\nI should use the search tool to see if there are any hands involving Seat 5.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this hand situation. I'm on the button with 4d8d, which is a weak hand. There's been a raise from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) who raised to 218 chips, which is effectively all-in since they have 0 chips? Wait, the table shows GPT-OSS-120B has 0 chips and is marked as \"out\". That seems confusing. Let me re-read: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). But the actions say \"Seat 5 raise 218\". That doesn't make sense if they have 0 chips. Maybe it's a misprint or they're actually all-in? \n\nActually, looking at the pot: it's 230 chips. Blinds are 4/8. I posted SB 4, Seat 4 posted BB 8. That's 12 chips. Then Seat 5 raised 218, making total pot 230. So Seat 5 must have had at least 218 chips. But the table says 0 chips. This is inconsistent.\n\nRegardless, I need to make a decision. I have 250 chips total, 31.2 BB. Amount to call is 214 chips, which would leave me with only 36 chips if I call. That's a huge portion of my stack - about 85% of it.\n\nMy hand is 4d8d suited, which is very weak. Even suited connectors need better odds to call. The pot odds: I need to call 214 to win 230 + 214 = 444? Actually, pot is 230, I call 214, total pot would be 444. So I'm getting about 1:1 odds (214 to win 230, actually 214 to win 230? Wait, pot is 230 now, I call 214, pot becomes 444, my share is 214/444 = 48%. I need about 48% equity to break even.\n\nWith 4d8d against a likely strong raising range, I have nowhere near 48% equity. Even against a wide range, 4d8s is around 30-35% equity at best. Against a tight range, it's worse.\n\nPosition: I'm on the button, which is good, but I'm facing a huge raise that commits most of my stack. If I call, I'll be playing for my tournament life with a weak hand.\n\nTournament considerations: With 31.2 BB, I have a decent stack. Folding leaves me with 250 chips (31.2 BB). Calling and losing would leave me with 36 chips (4.5 BB) and basically crippled.\n\nI should check opponent tendencies, but the tool calls are failing due to format issues. However, even without that information, this is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, the price is too high, and I'd be risking most of my stack with poor equity.\n\nLet me think about the raise size: 218 into a 12 chip pot is a massive overbet. This suggests either a very strong hand or a bluff. But with my weak holding, I can't afford to find out.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

I'm below 10 big blinds.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has been playing somewhat tight, folding preflop often but occasionally raising. Stack is 318 chips (9.9 BB)\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Also seems tight, folding frequently preflop with occasional raises. Stack is 284 chips (8.9 BB)\n\n**Pot odds**: Need to call 32 to win 48 (1.5:1). With 3-9 offsuit, this is not worth it.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With only 9.6 BB, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold. 3-9 offsuit is not a hand I want to risk my tournament life on. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nEven though I'm on the button and have position, this hand is just too weak. The opponents seem to be playing relatively tight, but that doesn't make 3-9 offsuit playable with a short stack.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better hand or a better spot.",

That is a raise of 96 total (i.e., 64 more). That would be 3x BB (96) and 3x opponent's raise? Actually min raise is 96 total, which is 64 more than call (32). So raise to 96 = total bet 96, meaning we put 96 chips (including the 32 call). That would be 3 BB (96) vs opponent's 64 raise. Our stack 284, could also go all-in (284). But with K4 suited, not a strong hand. Should we fold? In short stack, maybe consider shove if we think opponent is stealing with wide range. But K4c is not a great hand to shove; but could be okay vs a raise from MP/CO maybe? However we have only 8.9 BB, typical push/fold threshold is about 10 BB, you can shove with a decent range, but K4c is marginal. Also opponent's raise size 64 (2 BB) over BB; that's a standard raise. Their range likely includes many broadways, suited connectors, etc. K4c is at bottom of push range. Better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

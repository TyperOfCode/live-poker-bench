            "reasoning_content": "  The user is telling me I need to provide a JSON response with my action. Let me think about this hand first.\n\nPosition: BTN (Button)\nCards: 7h Kc (King-Seven offsuit)\nStack: 672 chips (10.5 BB)\nBlinds: 32/64\nPot: 96\nAmount to call: 32\nMinimum raise: 128\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nThis is a tournament situation. With 10.5 BBs, I'm in a medium-short stack position. K7o is a marginal hand, especially from the button.\n\nLet me think:\n1. Hand strength: K7o is weak. King-high but weak kicker, not connected, not suited\n2. Position: Button is good position post-flop\n3. Stack: 10.5 BB is getting short but not desperate yet\n4. Opponent: Only BB left to act (GPT-OSS-120B with 174 chips, about 2.7 BB)\n5. Pot odds: Need to call 32 to win 96, getting 3:1 odds\n\nThe BB is very short-stacked at 174 chips (2.7 BB). If I raise, I might isolate against them. But K7o is still weak.\n\nOptions:\n- Fold: Preserve stack, wait for better spot\n- Call: See flop cheaply in position, but calling with weak hand when short-stacked is generally bad\n- Raise: Could steal blinds, but risk committing chips with weak hand\n\nWith 10.5 BB, I should be thinking about push/fold strategy. K7o from button with one short-stacked opponent is actually a reasonable push/fold spot - many push/fold charts would say to shove here.\n\nBut I need to consider the raise sizing. Minimum raise is 128, which is about 20% of my stack. If I raise to 128 and get called or re-raised, I'm committed.\n\nGiven that BB is very short (2.7 BB), they might call with a wide range. K7o doesn't play well against a wide calling range.\n\nI think the best play is to fold here and preserve my stack for a better spot. I can find better hands to play with 10.5 BB.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. From the button with 10.5 BB, K7o is actually a decent hand to shove with according to push/fold charts, especially against a short-stacked BB. The BB only has 174 chips, so if I raise to 128 and they shove, I'd be calling 46 more chips into a pot of 174+128+32 = 334, getting about 7:1 odds.\n\nActually, I should just fold. K7o is too weak to risk my tournament life on. I can wait for a better hand or better spot.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** Qh Ad - This is a very strong starting hand, especially in position. Ace-Queen offsuit is a premium hand.\n\n**Position:** SB (small blind) - This is out of position postflop, which is a disadvantage.\n\n**Stack:** 368 chips (92 BB) - Healthy stack, deep enough to play comfortably.\n\n**Situation:** \n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) raised to 8\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) called 8\n- I need to call 6 more (I've already posted 2 in SB)\n- Pot is 22 chips\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- MiniMax-M2: Has been active, calling and betting. They raised preflop here which shows strength. In hand 19 they called preflop, called flop, then bet turn. In hand 20 they called multiple streets. They seem like a solid, active player.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Has been mostly folding preflop, only played hand 20 where they raised preflop and bet flop. They seem tight/passive overall but capable of raising with strong hands.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** AQ is a premium hand, especially suited. I should definitely play this hand.\n2. **Position:** Being in SB means I'll be out of position postflop, which is a disadvantage. However, with AQ I can flop strong pairs and draws.\n3. **Action:** There's a raise and a call in front of me. This suggests both players have decent hands.\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 6 to win 22, giving me 3.67:1 odds. This is excellent for AQ.\n5. **Options:**\n   - Fold: Too weak with AQ, this is a clear mistake\n   - Call: Reasonable, see a flop and evaluate. But I'll be out of position.\n   - Raise: 3-betting would show strength and potentially isolate one player. With AQ in SB facing a raise and call, a 3-bet is standard.\n\n**Decision:** I should raise. With AQ in the SB facing a raise and call, I want to:\n1. Build the pot with my premium hand\n2. Potentially isolate to one opponent\n3. Take initiative in the hand\n4. Charge drawing hands\n\nA standard 3-bet size would be 3x the original raise (24) plus maybe a bit more since there's a caller. The minimum raise is 12, but I should raise more. A good size would be around 28-32 chips.\n\nLet me raise to 28 chips total (which is 20 more than the 8 I would call). This is about 3.5x the original raise.\n\nActually, wait - the minimum raise to is 12, which means I need to put in 12 total. But that's too small. Let me think about proper sizing. The raise was to 8, so to 3-bet, I should go to around 24-32. Let me raise to 28 total.",

I get to act last post-flop.\n\n**Current situation**:\n- Pot is 88 chips\n- I need to call 20 chips to see the flop\n- The action: \n  - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8\n  - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called 8\n  - I re-raised to 28\n  - Small blind folded\n  - Seat 4 re-raised to 48 (4-bet)\n  - Seat 5 folded\n\nSo now it's heads-up between me and Seat 4. I need to call 20 more chips (48-28=20).\n\n**Pot odds**: I'm getting 88:20 or 4.4:1 pot odds. That's very good.\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They've been fairly active, with some preflop raises (usually small 4-chip raises)\n- In hand 19, they called preflop, checked flop, called a bet, then bet on the turn\n- In hand 20, they called preflop, called on flop, then bet on turn\n- They seem like a straightforward player who bets when they have something\n\n**Stack sizes**:\n- Me: 342 chips (85.5 BB)\n- MiniMax-M2: 167 chips\n- This is a deep stack situation for me\n\n**Decision**: \nI have a strong hand (AQ) in position against an opponent who has shown they can make moves. The pot odds are excellent (4.4:1). \n\nThe 4-bet from MiniMax-M2 could mean:\n1. A very strong hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK)\n2. A strong hand they're testing with\n3. A bluff or semi-bluff\n\nGiven that they've made small raises before (4 chips) and now made it 48, this seems like a genuine strong hand. However, with AQ on the button and good pot odds, I should call.\n\nI should NOT raise here because:\n1. I'm out of position if I raise (I'd be first to act post-flop)\n2. The 4-bet suggests real strength\n3. I want to see the flop with my strong hand and good position\n\nLet me call 20 chips.",

            "reasoning_content": "  The user has provided a poker hand scenario and I need to make a decision. Let me analyze this step by step.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Hand #21, FLOP stage\n- My position: BTN (Button)\n- My cards: Qh Ad (Ace-Queen suited, hearts)\n- My stack: 322 chips (80.5 BB)\n- Board: Jc 6d Ts\n- Pot: 108 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have Ace-Queen of hearts. The board shows Jc 6d Ts. This gives me:\n- No pair\n- Ace-high\n- A gutshot straight draw (I need a King to make a straight: Q-J-T-9-K)\n- Backdoor flush draw (if hearts come on turn and river)\n\n**Preflop Action Analysis:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called 8\n- I (Seat 1) re-raised to 28\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 4 re-raised to 48 (4-bet)\n- Seat 5 folded\n- I called 20 more (the 4-bet)\n\nSo the preflop action went: raise, call, 3-bet, fold, 4-bet, fold, call.\n\nThis is significant aggression from MiniMax-M2. They 4-bet after my 3-bet, which shows real strength.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall data, MiniMax-M2 has been:\n- Generally passive preflop (lots of calls, some folds)\n- Aggressive postflop (bets on turn in multiple hands)\n- They called a 3-bet and then 4-bet in this hand\n\nThe 4-bet preflop is a strong move. Typical 4-bet ranges include: AA, KK, QQ, AK (sometimes JJ, TT, AQ).\n\n**Current Board:**\nJc 6d Ts\n\nThis board is somewhat coordinated. There are potential straight draws (any K or 9 gives a straight, any 7-8 gives a straight). \n\nIf MiniMax-M2 has:\n- AA/KK: I'm way behind\n- QQ: I'm drawing to 3 outs (the remaining Queens)\n- JJ: They have top set, I'm crushed\n- TT: They have middle set, I'm crushed\n- AK: They have top pair top kicker, I'm behind but have some outs (any Q gives me top pair, any A gives me top pair, any K gives me a straight)\n- AQ: We're chopping if an A or Q comes, but they might have me outkicked\n\n\n- 99/88: They have a gutshot, I'm ahead with Ace-high\n\nI realize I'm in a precarious position with a marginal hand. The preflop 4-bet suggests MiniMax-M2 has a strong range, and my current hand doesn't match up well. Checking seems like the most prudent move to control the pot size and see how the hand develops.\n\nThe pot's already substantial at 108 chips, representing about a third of my stack. With limited information and a weak drawing hand, I need to be cautious. My opponent's aggression indicates they likely have a premium hand, making any aggressive move risky.\n\nI'll carefully consider my options: check to see the next card, or potentially fold if the situation becomes unfavorable. The goal is to minimize potential losses while keeping some flexibility in my play.\n\nMy best strategic move is to check, allowing me to:\n- Potentially improve my hand\n- Avoid committing more chips\n- Assess my opponent's next action\n- Preserve my tournament life\n\nThis conservative approach seems most prudent given the current circumstances.",

The board shows Jc 6d Ts.\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (need a King to make Broadway)\n- I have backdoor nut flush draw (need two more hearts)\n- I have two overcards (Ace and Queen)\n\n**Opponent behavior analysis:**\nFrom the recall data, MiniMax-M2 shows:\n- Frequently calls preflop (passive)\n- Often checks flop then bets turn (delayed c-bet pattern)\n- Makes small to medium-sized bets\n- Has shown aggression on turn in multiple hands\n- No showdown data available\n\nThe preflop action suggests opponent has a strong hand. The 4-bet to 48 chips is significant. On this flop (Jc 6d Ts), they're betting 40 into 148 pot (27% pot bet).\n\n**Pot odds:** \nI need to call 40 to win 148, getting 3.7:1 odds. I need ~21% equity to call.\n\n**My equity:** With Ace-Queen on this board:\n- Against an overpair (AA, KK, QQ): ~25% equity\n- Against top pair (AJ, KJ, QJ): ~30% equity  \n- Against a set: ~15% equity\n- Against two pair: ~20% equity\n- Against a made straight (KQ): ~18% equity\n\nI have about 8-10 outs (3 Kings for straight, maybe 6 overcard outs if Ace is good, plus backdoor flush potential).\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I have position\n2. I have some equity with gutshot and overcards\n3. Opponent's stack is 127, pot is 148 - they're committed\n4. I can apply pressure with a raise\n5. My stack is healthy enough to take some risk\n\nGiven the opponent's pattern of checking flops and betting turns, they might be making a standard c-bet here. A raise could represent a strong hand like a set, two pair, or a made straight. However, I need to consider that the preflop 4-bet suggests real strength.\n\nI think calling is reasonable given the pot odds and my equity, but raising could be better because:\n- I have fold equity\n- I can take control of the hand\n- If they have a marginal hand, they might fold\n- I can represent a strong hand myself\n\nBut looking at my stack and the opponent's remaining stack (127), if I raise, I should consider a raise that puts pressure but doesn't commit my entire stack unnecessarily.\n\nLet me call this time. The pot odds are good, I have decent equity, and I can evaluate on the turn. Raising might be overplaying my hand given that opponent 4-bet preflop.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with Qh Ad\n- My stack: 282 chips (70.5 BB)\n- Board: Jc 6d Ts Kc\n- Pot: 188 chips\n- I have 0 to call (action is on me to check or raise)\n\n**My hand analysis:**\nI have Qh Ad with the board showing Jc 6d Ts Kc. Let me evaluate my hand:\n- I have Ace-high with a Queen kicker\n- The board shows: J-T-6-K (four cards)\n- I have a gutshot straight draw: Any Ace gives me a straight (A-K-Q-J-T)\n- I also have backdoor flush draw with hearts\n- Currently, I only have Ace-high\n\n**Opponent information:**\nMiniMax-M2 is in Seat 4 with 127 chips. Looking at their history:\n- They seem to be aggressive post-flop, frequently betting on the turn\n- In hand 19, they called a flop bet then bet 24 on turn\n- In hand 20, they called flop then bet 8 on turn\n- They have a pattern of betting on the turn after seeing the flop\n\n**Current action:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax raised to 8, I re-raised to 28, they re-raised to 48, I called\n- Flop: I checked, they bet 40, I called\n- Turn: Board is Jc 6d Ts Kc, I can check or raise\n\n**Pot odds and stack considerations:**\n- Pot is 188 chips\n- MiniMax has 127 chips left\n- I have 282 chips\n- If I check, they might bet and I can evaluate\n- If I raise, I could put pressure on them\n\n**Hand strength:**\nI have Ace-high with a gutshot straight draw (any Ace gives me the nut straight). The board is somewhat coordinated with straight and flush possibilities. \n\nAgainst an opponent who has been aggressive and re-raised preflop, then bet the flop, they likely have:\n- A strong hand like top pair (Kx, Jx, Tx)\n- Two pair\n- Maybe a set\n- Possibly a strong draw\n\nWith Ace-high and a gutshot, I have some equity but I'm likely behind. However, I have position and can check to see what they do, or I could apply pressure with a raise.\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have some equity with the gutshot\n2. My opponent has been aggressive but has a relatively short stack (127 chips)\n3. The pot is already large (188 chips)\n4. I can check and see their action, potentially inducing a bluff or controlling the pot size\n\nI think checking is the best option here. I want to see what they do, and I can always evaluate on the river. If they have a marginal hand, they might check back and give me a free card to hit my straight. If they bet, I can decide based on the size and my pot odds.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have Ace-high with a gutshot to the nuts. The board is Jc 6d Ts Kc. Looking at the betting:\n- Preflop: MiniMax raised to 8, I re-raised to 28, they re-raised to 48, I called\n- Flop: I checked, they bet 40, I called\n\nThe preflop action suggests they have a strong hand. The flop bet of 40 into what was likely a ~100 chip pot is a substantial bet. They have 127 chips left.\n\nIf I check, they might:\n1. Check back with a marginal hand\n2. Bet with a strong hand or bluff\n\nIf I raise now on the turn, I could:\n1. Take down the pot immediately\n2. Get called by worse hands\n3. Force them to make a tough decision with their remaining stack\n\nGiven that I have Ace-high and a gutshot, and my opponent has shown aggression but has a short stack, I think checking is better to control the pot size and see their action. I don't want to bloat the pot further with just Ace-high, even with the gutshot draw.\n\nLet me check.",

So I need Ace for straight (A-K-Q-J-T)\n- Overcard outs: Ace (3 outs), Queen (but I hold Qh, so no)\n- Backdoor flush draw: I have Qh, so no\n\nActually let me recount: Board is Jc 6d Ts Kc\nI have Qh Ad\nFor a straight: I need Ace (A-K-Q-J-T) or 9 (K-Q-J-T-9). I don't have 9, but Ace gives me the nut straight.\nSo I have 3 outs for the nut straight (three Aces left).\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nPot is 228, need to call 40.\nPot odds = 228:40 = 5.7:1\nI need ~15% equity to call.\n\nWith 3 outs, I have about 6.5% chance to hit on river.\nThis is not enough based on pure pot odds.\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Seat 4 - MiniMax-M2):**\nLooking at the history:\n- They 3-bet preflop from 8 to 48 (big raise)\n- They bet 40 on flop (2/3 pot)\n- They bet 40 on turn (smaller relative to pot)\n\n\n- Pattern suggests strong, consistent betting with potentially strong hands\n- Likely holdings include premium pairs, two pairs, or strong drawing hands\n- Their betting indicates significant strength, probably top pair or better\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Tournament context requires careful chip management\n- Fold equity appears minimal given opponent's betting pattern\n- Drawing to only 3 outs is mathematically unsound\n- Risk of opponent having superior hand is high\n\n**Recommended Action:**\nFold due to insufficient pot odds and opponent's demonstrated strength.\n\nThe opponent's consistent betting suggests a strong made hand, likely top pair or better. With only 3 outs and poor pot odds, calling or raising would be mathematically and strategically unsound. Folding preserves tournament chips for better opportunities.",

            "reasoning_content": "Now let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with Ks9c, which is a weak hand - K9o is not a premium hand. The pot is 48 chips after the action: SB (Seat 1) posted 2, I posted 4, Seat 4 raised to 8, Seat 5 called 8, and then Seat 1 (SB) 3-bet to 28 total (raising by 20 more).\n\nI need to call 24 chips (28 total minus my 4 BB). My stack is 189 chips (47.2 BB). The pot odds: I need to call 24 to win 48+8+8+28 = 92 chips (pot of 48 + 24 call + 20 from SB's raise). Actually let me calculate: Current pot is 48 (2+4+8+8+26? Wait, Seat 1 raised to 28 total, which includes their 2 SB, so they added 26 more). Actually the pot before Seat 1's action: SB 2, BB 4, Seat 4 raise to 8, Seat 5 call 8 = 22. Then Seat 1 raises to 28 total, adding 26 more. So pot is now 22+26=48. I need to call 24 to win 48+24=72 if no one else calls. But Seat 4 and 5 still have to act after me.\n\nFrom the opponent history:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has raised preflop a couple times (hand 14 and 18 raised to 6). In hand 6 showdown had 9s8s. Seems somewhat aggressive.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has called preflop bets, showed down with weak hands like 9dTs and 4d8c.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded preflop, raised once in hand 20, showed down with 8h2h.\n\nMy hand K9o is marginal, especially facing a 3-bet. I'm out of position (BB) and will have to act first on every street. The 3-bet from the SB suggests strength - could be a wide range since it's a squeeze play against the initial raiser and caller.\n\nPot odds: 24 to call into 48 pot = 2:1 odds (33% equity needed). K9o has maybe 30-35% equity against a typical 3-bet range? But I'm also worried about the original raiser and caller behind me - they could re-raise or call, making the pot multi-way which could be good or bad for K9o.\n\nMy stack is 189 chips (47 BB). Calling 24 chips would put 12.7% of my stack in preflop. That's significant but not devastating.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm not the shortest stack (Seat 2 has 0, folded), but I'm below average. Seat 1 has 342, Seat 4 has 207, Seat 5 has 208.\n\nGiven the weak hand, out of position, facing a 3-bet, and with two players left to act behind me, folding seems prudent. K9o doesn't play well multi-way or against aggression. The pot odds are decent but implied odds are poor since I'm out of position and the board will likely miss my hand.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns from Seat 1's 3-bets. Let me search for more info.",

There was a raise to 8 from seat 4, a call from seat 5, and then a 3-bet to 28 from seat 1 (the small blind). I need to call 24 chips.\n\nLet me analyze:\n1. My hand: K9o is not a strong hand, especially out of position. It's dominated by many hands that would 3-bet.\n2. Position: I'm in the BB, so I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand against multiple players.\n3. Stack sizes: I have 189 chips (47 BB), which is a decent stack. Seat 1 has 342, seat 4 has 207, seat 5 has 208.\n4. The pot: Currently 48 chips (2+4+8+8+28? Wait, let me calculate: SB posted 2, I posted BB 4, seat 4 raised to 8, seat 5 called 8, seat 1 raised to 28). So pot is 2+4+8+8+28 = 50? Actually, seat 1's raise includes his SB, so total in pot: SB 2, BB 4, seat 4's 8, seat 5's 8, seat 1's additional 26 (28 total - 2 SB) = 48 chips. Yes, pot is 48.\n5. I need to call 24 to win 48, so pot odds are 2:1.\n6. Opponent tendencies: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has shown some aggression - raised to 6 in hand 18 preflop, but otherwise folded. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been calling and betting in some hands. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) just called the initial raise.\n\nWith K9o, facing a 3-bet from the small blind, I'm likely dominated. Even if I hit a pair, I could be up against better kings or better pairs. Being out of position makes it worse. The pot odds are decent (2:1), but implied odds are poor because I'm out of position and could face more betting.\n\nIn tournament poker, preserving my stack is important. K9o is a fold in this spot, especially facing a 3-bet. I should wait for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. The minimum raise to is 48, which would be a significant portion of my stack. Not worth it with this hand.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n1. My hand: Js Jh (pocket Jacks) - this is a very strong premium hand, especially in a tournament setting\n2. My position: BB (Big Blind) - good position\n3. Current situation: \n   - I'm facing a 28 chip raise from Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking)\n   - I need to call 20 more chips to see the flop\n   - The minimum raise would be to 48 total (but I'm not the current bettor, so this doesn't apply to me)\n   - Stack sizes are relatively deep (200+ chips each)\n\n4. Current pot: 48 chips\n5. My stack: 207 chips (51.8 BB)\n6. Opponents: Seat 1 has 342 chips, Seat 5 has 208 chips\n\nThe action sequence:\n- Seat 1 posted SB (2 chips)\n- Seat 3 posted BB (4 chips) \n- I raised to 8 chips\n- Seat 5 called 8 chips\n- Seat 1 re-raised to 28 chips\n- Seat 3 folded\n\nSo it's currently heads-up between me and Seat 1, with Seat 5 also in the hand.\n\nWith pocket Jacks, I have a very strong hand. This is definitely a hand I want to continue with, especially since:\n1. I'm getting decent pot odds to call (need to call 20 to win 48 = about 2.4:1 odds)\n2. Pocket Jacks is a premium hand that should be played aggressively\n3. I'm in position postflop\n4. The opponent is showing aggression, which might indicate a strong hand, but I have a hand that can win\n\nI should consider raising here. With pocket Jacks, I want to build the pot and protect my hand. However, I need to be careful because:\n1. The opponent has shown significant strength by 3-betting\n\n\n2. They might have a stronger hand like QQ, KK, AA, or AK\n3. I should consider the stack sizes and tournament implications\n\nI'll evaluate the potential risks carefully. The 20-chip call offers good value, and my strong pocket Jacks warrant further investigation. Raising could maximize my potential winnings, but I must remain cautious about the opponent's possible stronger holdings. The key is balancing aggression with strategic assessment of the board's potential.\n\nAnalyzing the betting dynamics reveals a complex preflop scenario. The raise and re-raise suggest significant strength from Seat 1, with a substantial 7x raise indicating premium cards. This aggressive betting pattern raises red flags about potential overpairs or high-value hands.\n\nMy pocket Jacks demand careful consideration. While strong, the betting history suggests I might be outmaneuvered by a potentially superior hand. The 20-chip call to win 48 chips provides reasonable pot odds, but the risk of being dominated looms large.\n\nThe strategic choice narrows to either a cautious call or a bold re-raise, each carrying significant tournament implications. My decision will hinge on reading the opponent's range and managing my stack effectively.\n\nPocket Jacks demand respect, especially when facing a 3-bet. The strength of my hand justifies aggressive play, and the pot odds make calling an attractive option. I'm positioned to extract value while protecting against potential threats.\n\nThe minimum raise to 48 chips presents an interesting tactical opportunity. By strategically raising, I can gauge the opponent's hand strength and potentially build a more substantial pot. This approach allows me to control the betting dynamics and potentially force out weaker holdings.\n\nMy stack depth provides flexibility, and the strong nature of pocket Jacks supports a proactive betting strategy. The goal is to maximize value while maintaining a balanced approach to risk management.",

The current situation is:\n- Seat 1 bet 28 (this is a 3-bet after my initial raise to 8)\n- I need to call 20 more to make it 28 total\n- Or I can raise to 48 total (which would be raising by 20 more chips)\n\nGiven that I have pocket Jacks, this is a hand I want to play aggressively.

The opponent checked, which often indicates they don't have a strong hand, but they could still have hands that will call (like lower Jacks, Tens, or overpairs).\n \nThe minimum raise of 20 chips provides a strategic approach to extract value while maintaining control. A standard bet of around 40-50 chips seems optimal to balance value extraction and potential opponent response. The goal is to build the pot with my strong hand while avoiding scaring off opponents who might call with moderate holdings.\n\nMy recent performance shows a 35% win rate, with 7 wins in 20 hands. This context suggests I'm in a position to capitalize on a strong hand like trips Jacks. The opponent's checking pattern indicates potential weakness, making a value bet even more compelling.\n\nThe key considerations are maximizing chip accumulation, protecting my strong hand, and extracting value from potential calling ranges. A well-sized bet around 40 chips represents the most effective strategy to achieve these objectives.",

In BTN vs raise from MP (seat4). Stack sizes: opponent 207 chips, about 51.75 BB. Our stack 54 BB. Raise size 8 (2x BB). So it's a standard open raise from MP? Actually it's a raise from seat4 (likely MP). He raised 8 (2x BB). That's a small raise. We could call and see flop. QcTc offsuit is a decent hand in BTN, can be played profitably.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall shows MiniMax-M2 raised 4 previously (preflop) in two earlier hands. That suggests maybe they raise small amounts, perhaps wide range.\n\nOur position: BTN, best position post-flop. Stack deep enough.\n\nPot odds: To call 8 to win pot of 14+8 = 22? Actually pot currently 14 (SB+BB+raise). To call 8 adds to pot, making total 22 after call. So we are getting 22/8 = 2.75:1 pot odds, need ~36.4% equity. QcTc vs unknown range likely >36%? Might be borderline. But we have position.\n\nGiven we have a decent hand and position, could call and try to see flop. Raising could be possible to isolate and build pot. Minimum raise is 12 (total). That would be raise to 12, adding 4 more beyond call. That would be a small raise. Might be okay.\n\nBut we must consider risk: If opponent is aggressive and can 3-bet, raising might invite a 3-bet. But with 54 BB, we can handle.\n\nI think best action: call. Reason: decent hand, good position, pot odds okay, opponent likely raising wide.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

Seat5 (us) called 8 (so we put 4 more). Seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 28 (so 20 more). Seat3 folded. Seat4 re-raised to 48 (so 40 more). Now amount to call is 40 (to match 48). Minimum raise to 68 (i.e., raise at least to 68 total). Our stack 208, we can raise. Need to decide.\n\nWe have Tc Qd suited? Actually Qd, Tc (different suits). So offsuit. On button, but facing 3-bet (mini max) after 2-bet and a raise from seat1 (likely a 3-bet). Actually sequence: initial raise by seat4 to 8 (open). Then seat5 (us) call. Seat1 raises to 28 (3-bet). Seat4 re-raises to 48 (4-bet). So now we are facing a 4-bet. Our hand TQ offsuit is weak vs 4-bet. Opponents: seat4 (MiniMax-M2) likely tight? Not sure. Seat1 also raised.\n\nWe have 208 stack, pot currently: preflop pot: initial blinds 2+4 =6, plus seat4 8, seat5 8, seat1 28, seat4 48. So total contributions: seat4: 8+40=48, seat5:8, seat1:28, blinds:6. So pot = 48+8+28+6 = 90? Actually 48+8=56, +28=84, +6=90. Yes pot 90. To call 40 to see flop. Is TQ offsuit a good call? Likely not. 4-bet likely strong (AA, KK, QQ, AK). TQ offsuit has low equity vs that. Should fold.\n\nWe could consider 4-bet bluff? Our stack 208, min raise to 68 total, would be 68 total (i.e., raise to 68). That's a small raise relative to pot (pot 90). Not a good bluff. Better fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

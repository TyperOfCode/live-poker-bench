It has almost no playability post-flop. Even if I hit a pair, it's likely to be dominated. The only real hope is hitting a straight (which is very unlikely) or two pair/trips.\n\n2. **Stack size**: With only 8.5 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I should only be playing premium hands or going all-in. Calling with a weak hand like this is terrible for my stack.\n\n3. **Position**: While being on the button is good, it's less relevant with such a short stack and such a weak hand.\n \nI need to preserve my tournament life. With such a short stack, every chip is critical. Folding this hand maintains my flexibility for future opportunities. The pot odds of 3:1 don't justify playing such a weak starting hand, especially when my tournament survival is at stake. I'll save my limited chips for a stronger hand that gives me a real chance to double up or steal blinds.\n\nThe strategic move is clear: fold and wait for a more favorable situation.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: 4s Td (offsuit, very weak)\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - good position\n\n**Stack**: 540 chips (16.9 BB) - getting short\n\n**Blinds**: 16/32\n\n**Pot**: 48 chips\n\n**Action**: I posted SB (16), BB posted 32. It's back to me. I need to call 16 more to see the flop.\n\n**Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B in BB with 354 chips (11 BB)\n\nLooking at opponent history:\n- Very tight player - has folded preflop in 6 of last 10 actions\n- When they do raise, they raise big (268, 316, 396 chips)\n- They check-folded on turn in hand 79\n- Overall pattern: tight, but when they play they commit chips\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 4s Td is terrible. Not suited, not connected well, low cards.\n2. **Position**: Good position on button, but only heads-up vs BB\n3. **Stack size**: I'm getting short at 16.9 BB. I need to be selective and preserve chips.\n4. **Opponent**: BB is tight and has shown willingness to raise big. If I call, I risk facing a large raise.\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 48, so 3:1 odds. But with this hand, even those odds aren't good enough.\n6. **Tournament situation**: I should preserve my chips for better spots. With 16.9 BB, I can still do damage with a good hand.\n\nEven though I'm getting decent pot odds (3:1) and have position, T4o is just too weak to play, especially against a tight opponent who might raise me off the hand anyway. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nThe fact that I'm on the button is nice, but with only one opponent (the BB), position advantage is minimized. And my hand has very poor equity against any reasonable BB calling/range.\n\nI should fold.",

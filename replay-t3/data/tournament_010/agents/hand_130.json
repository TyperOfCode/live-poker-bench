My hand is extremely weak (3-4 offsuit)\n2. I'm short-stacked at 9 BB\n3. The opponent has mostly been folding but can raise\n4. I need to pay 32 chips to see a flop (about 5.5% of my stack)\n5. Even if I hit something, it's unlikely to be strong enough to commit my stack\n\nWith a short stack, I should be very selective about which hands I play. 3-4 offsuit is not a hand worth playing, especially when I'm already invested as the small blind. The opponent has shown they can raise, and if they do, I'll be forced to fold and lose 32 chips anyway.\n\nBetter to fold now and preserve my 9 BB stack for a better opportunity. I should wait for a stronger hand or a better spot to shove.\n\nDecision: FOLD",

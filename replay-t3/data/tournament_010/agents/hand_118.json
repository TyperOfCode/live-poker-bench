            "reasoning_content": "  The user is asking me to make a decision in a poker hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Hand #118, PREFLOP\n- My Position: BTN (Button/Seat 1)\n- My Cards: 3d 2h (3 of diamonds, 2 of hearts) - This is a very weak hand, 3-2 offsuit\n- My Stack: 576 chips (9.0 BB)\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 96 chips\n- Amount to call: 32 (I posted SB of 32, need to call 32 more to match BB)\n- Minimum raise to: 128\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n- Players: Only me (BTN/SB) and GPT-OSS-120B (BB) are active\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nI just recalled GPT-OSS-120B's actions. Let me review:\n- Hands 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 113, 115, 117: FOLDED preflop\n- Hand 100: Called 48, bet 48 on flop, called 132 on flop, checked turn, folded turn\n- Hand 109: Called 32 preflop, then checked down to river\n- Hand 111: Raised to 142 preflop\n- Hand 114: Raised to 192 preflop\n\nSo GPT-OSS-120B is somewhat active, raising occasionally (hands 111, 114) but also folding a lot. They seem to be playing a somewhat tight-aggressive style.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n3d 2h is one of the worst starting hands in Texas Hold'em. It's offsuit, low, and doesn't connect well. Even if I hit a straight, it would be the low end.\n\n**Stack Size Considerations:**\nI have 576 chips (9 BB), which is short-stacked. At this stage, I need to be selective with my hands. With 9 BB, I should generally be looking for spots to shove or fold, not calling raises with marginal hands.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm on the Button (acting as SB in this heads-up situation), so I have position post-flop, but that doesn't matter much with such a weak hand.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nPot is 96, I need to call 32. That's 3:1 pot odds. But with 3-2 offsuit, even those odds aren't good enough. The hand has very little equity against any random hand.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWith 9 BB, I'm in danger zone. I need to preserve my stack for better spots. This is a clear fold situation. I should wait for a better hand (any pocket pair, any Ace, any two cards 10+, or suited connectors maybe).\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a trivial fold. 3-2 offsuit is a fold in almost any situation, especially with a short stack. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nLet me make the decision:",

It's suited but very low. In a 3-bet pot, this is typically a fold.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB, worst position postflop.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 20 to win 36, so about 1.8:1. This is not great odds for a marginal hand.\n\n4. **Implied odds**: Not great with a low suited connector when facing a 3-bet from a tight player.\n\n5. **Stack preservation**: I have a healthy stack (76 BB). Calling here would commit me to a marginal spot out of position.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: GPT-OSS-120B's 3-bet to 24 suggests real strength. MiniMax-M2's initial raise could be wide, but facing the 3-bet, I should respect GPT-OSS-120B's action.\n\nThis is a clear fold. I'm out of position with a marginal hand facing a 3-bet from a player who appears to have a strong, narrow range. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify calling, and raising would be spewing chips with such a weak hand.",

The 16 chip call represents only about 6% of my stack (253 chips), making it a manageable decision even if I miss the flop.\n\nI could consider raising to 40 chips to apply pressure, but given that my hand is more of a drawing hand that benefits from seeing a flop, calling to realize my positional advantage seems optimal.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Qd Th is a solid suited connector with good equity and potential.

In hand #30, they raised to 12 preflop, called 8 on the flop, bet 8 on the turn, and then folded on the river\n3. In hand #31, they checked down through the turn and folded\n4. I can see they have shown down hands with:\n   - 8h 2h (lost with a pair of 2s)\n   - Ad Ts (lost with a pair of 2s)\n\nNow let me analyze my current situation:\n- My cards: Qd Th (queen-ten suited)\n- Position: BTN (button) - good position\n- Stack: 253 chips (63.2 BB)\n- Facing: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 24 chips preflop\n- Amount to call: 16 chips (since I already put in 8)\n- Minimum raise to: 40 chips total\n\nMy Qd Th is a decent hand, especially in position. It's suited, has straight potential, and can make top pair. Against a player who seems moderately active but not overly aggressive, this could be a profitable call.\n\nThe pot odds are quite good - I need to call 16 to potentially win 36 (current pot) + 16 = 52 chips, giving me pot odds of about 30.8%. \n\nQ-T suited has decent equity against a typical raising range. Against a range of hands like 77+, A9s+, KQs, QJs, JTs, T9s, 98s, 87s, ATo+, KQo, my Qd Th should have around 45-50% equity, which is well above the 30.8% I need.\n\nHowever, I should also consider tournament factors. With 63.2 BB, I'm in a comfortable stack size. Calling 16 chips represents about 6.3% of my stack, which is manageable.\n \nI'm leaning towards a call, recognizing the positional advantage and hand strength. The suited queen-ten offers multiple drawing possibilities and good potential to improve. With solid pot odds and a favorable position, the call seems like a strategic move to stay in the hand and potentially capitalize on my position.\n",

This suggests a relatively passive river play style.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Opponent checked on the river (amount to call = 0)\n- I can check to see showdown or bet 30+ chips\n- Pot is 112 chips, so any bet would be significant\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that:\n1. My hand is medium-strength (pair of Queens with Ten kicker)\n2. Opponent appears passive on rivers\n3. I'm risking 30 chips to potentially win 142 chips (pot + bet)\n4. I'm vulnerable to any King, Ace, or better Queen\n\nThe conservative approach is to check and see the showdown.

Tournament strategy requires careful chip management\n5. Aggressive play might pressure the passive opponent\n\nThe opponent's consistent river checking suggests caution. With a medium-strength hand like Queens, the risk of being called by a superior hand is high. Checking seems the most prudent move to minimize potential losses and avoid unnecessary chip expenditure.\n\nThe passive nature of the opponent's play implies they might fold to a bet, but the potential downside of being called by a stronger hand outweighs the potential gain. Preservation of chip stack takes precedence over marginal betting opportunities.\n\nA strategic fold or check maintains position and prevents unnecessary risk, especially given the board's complexity and the opponent's tight playing style.\n",

Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise total to at least 12). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on AK offsuit in SB vs raise from MP? Actually seat 4 is MP? Table: seat 1 is BB, seat 4 is MP? Not sure but seat 4 is likely UTG? Anyway they raised to 8 (3x BB). That's a standard raise. AK is a premium hand, should 3-bet. Stack is deep 54 BB, can 3-bet to maybe 2.5-3x raise size. Minimum raise is 12 (i.e., to 12 total). That is a small 3-bet but we could raise more. We can also call. But 3-betting is typical to isolate and build pot. Opponent's raise pattern: they sometimes raise 4 (small), 8, 48, 28. They have raised 8 multiple times, also 48 (big). So they may be variable. With AK, a 3-bet is advisable.\n\nWe need to decide raise amount. Legal actions: we can raise to any amount >=12. Typically we could raise to about 3x the original raise: original raise was 8 total, so 3x is 24. Considering stack 54 BB, we could raise to 20-25. Let's choose 24 total (i.e., raise to 24). That would be additional 22 chips (since we have already 2 posted, need to add 22 to make total 24). That's a decent 3-bet.\n\nReasoning: strong hand, position, deep stack, want to isolate, opponent's raise size moderate, we can apply pressure.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

MiniMax-M2 checked, likely with a weaker hand or a draw. Betting extracts value from hands like QJ, AQ, or draws and protects against potential spade draws. A moderate raise to 30 (~0.75 pot) balances value and risk.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "We have flop: Ks 4s Qc. Our hand: Kc Ad => top pair top kicker (pair of Kings with Ace kicker). Also a nut flush draw? Actually we have Kc and Ad, board has Ks, 4s, Qc. We have one spade (Kc is club, Ad is diamond). Board has two spades (Ks and 4s). So we have a flush draw with two spades on board, we have zero spades, so we need two spades for flush, not a draw. Straight draw? Board: K Q 4, we have A, K. Potential straight? A K Q J 10? Not possible. So we have top pair, decent hand. Opponent MiniMax-M2 is in the pot. He raised preflop to 8 (small raise) then we 3-bet to 24, he called. So he's a caller of 3-bet. On flop, it's his turn to act first? Actually order: preflop: seat 4 raise, seat5 raise, seat4 call. So seat5 is BB, seat4 is UTG? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2. After flop, action order: seat4 acts first (since he is earlier seat). The flop is checked to us (amount to call 0). So MiniMax-M2 checked. We have top pair. We could bet for value and protect against draws. What is pot size? 52 chips. Our stack 194. Minimum raise to 16 (so raise must be at least 16 total). So a bet of 16 (to 16) is a raise (since amount to call is 0). That would be 16 total, which is about 1/3 pot. Could also check. Opponent's tendencies: from recall, he sometimes checks flop with weak hands, sometimes bets. In hand 30, he bet flop 8 into pot (size unknown). In hand 31, he checked flop, then bet turn 4. So he's capable of both. Given we have top pair, we likely want value. Also we want to protect against possible straight draws? Not many. There's potential backdoor flush draw for him? He could have spades. If he has spade flush draw (e.g., As 9s) board has two spades, he'd have two spades in hand to make flush. He could have open-ended straight draw? With K Q 4, possible draws: J10 (needs J and 10), not many combos. So not many draws.\n\nThus betting for value is good. How much? Minimum raise 16. Could raise bigger maybe 30-40 to get value from KQ, AQ, etc. But we have only 48.5 BB, still medium stack. Opponent has 237 chips, larger stack. Might want to size to get value but not risk too much. A bet of 30 would be about 0.75 pot, still okay. Minimum raise is 16, but we can raise higher. The legal actions are fold, check, raise. So we can raise to any amount >=16 up to our stack. Should we consider check? Checking gives free card but could allow opponent to see a turn cheap. Might give him chance to improve. Betting also protects.\n\nThus I will raise to 30 chips (total). Reasoning: top pair, value, protect, opponent likely calls with worse hands. So action: raise 30.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We have river decision. Our hand: Kc Ad. Board: Ks 4s Qc 6d 3h. So we have top pair (K) with Ace kicker, plus we have a pair of Kings (pair K) and Ace high. The board has possible straight draws: Q-J-10-9-8? Not present. Board: K Q 6 4 3. Straight possibilities: A K Q J 10 (we have A K Q but missing J10). Also possible straight with 5-4-3-2-A? We have 4-3 on board, but no 5 or 2. So no immediate straight. Flush possibility: Two spades on board (Kc is club, board has Ks (king of spades) and 4s (spade). Actually board: Ks (spade), 4s (spade). That's two spades. Our hand: Kc (club) and Ad (diamond). So we have no spade. So no flush.\n\nPotential for opponent having two pair or trips: Board has K Q 6 4 3. Opponent could have Qx for two pair Q-K? Actually board already has K and Q, so if opponent has Qx they'd have two pair Q-K. Could also have 6x for two pair 6-K etc. Or could have a set: If they have Kx they'd have set of Kings (but we have Kc, board has Ks, so they could have another King? Only one King left: Kd? Actually there are four kings: Kc (our), Ks (board), Kh, Kd. So opponent could have Kh or Kd, giving them a set (three of a kind) with board king. That's strong. Could also have a set of Qs if they have Qx, but board has Qc only one queen, so they'd need Qd, Qh, Qs for set. So possible.\n\nAlso could have a straight draw that missed, but likely they have something like a made hand.\n\nWe are on the river, pot is 112, opponent (MiniMax-M2) last action? The actions listed: turn: both checked. So on river, it's our turn (BB). Amount to call 0, min raise 30. So we can check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot check if we want to bet? Actually we can check (do nothing). Raising would be a bet.\n\nWe need to decide whether to bet for value or check. Our hand is top pair with Ace kicker, but there are possible better hands: set of Kings (Kx), set of Queens, two pair QK, maybe straight? Not likely. So we have decent but not best.\n\nWe need to consider opponent's tendencies. Recall opponent actions: In recent hand 30, on river they bet 66 into pot? Let's see: hand 30: river bet 66. That suggests they sometimes bet on river. In hand 30 they had board? Unknown. In hand 31 they bet 4 on turn. So they are somewhat aggressive.\n\nBut we need to decide best action: likely check to avoid getting raised and losing more chips, unless we think opponent will call a bet with worse hand (like a queen high). But they could also have a set and raise.\n\nGiven we have 164 chips (41 BB). Pot 112, so bet of 30 would be about 27% of pot, maybe value bet. If we bet 30, opponent may call with weaker hands like Qx, 6x, etc. But also may raise if they have set.\n\nWhat about stack sizes? Opponent stack unknown, but they have 207 chips (they are seat 4). So they have more chips.\n\nWe need to decide best EV. Usually with top pair top kicker on river, it's a marginal hand. Often checking is safe to avoid being raised. However, if opponent is capable of checking down with worse hands, we could extract value by betting. But risk of being raised and losing more.\n\nWe can try to recall opponent's river behavior: In hand 30, they bet 66 on river. What was the board? Unknown. But they were aggressive. In hand 31 they bet 4 on turn, not river.\n\nGiven limited info, I'd lean to check to avoid risk.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

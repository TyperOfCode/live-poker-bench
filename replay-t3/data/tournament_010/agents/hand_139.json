This is essentially an all-in since they only have 32 chips total. Wait, let me recalculate: they posted 32 as SB, then raised 366. 32 + 366 = 398, but they only have 32 chips total. This seems like the raise was to 366 total, meaning they bet 334 more on top of their 32 SB, but they only have 32 chips. This is confusing.\n\nLet me re-read: \"Seat 5 post_sb 32\" and \"Seat 5 raise 366\". The raise is likely TO 366 total, not BY 366. So they raised from 64 to 366, which is a raise of 302. Since they only have 32 chips, this must mean the raise is 32 (all-in) and the system is showing 366 as the total bet size including what's already in the pot.\n\nActually, looking at it more carefully: The pot is 430 chips. The SB posted 32, I posted BB 64. If opponent raises to 366 total, that would be 302 more than the BB. But they only have 32 chips, so they can only raise by 32 total (all-in). \n\nI think the system is showing the total amount the opponent would need to match if I were to call, not the actual raise amount. Let me think about this differently: The opponent has 32 chips and is all-in. The amount to call is 302, which suggests there's already 398 in the pot (430 pot - 32 opponent chips = 398 from previous action + my BB).\n\nWait, let me recalculate from scratch:\n- SB: 32 chips (from opponent)\n- BB: 64 chips (from me)\n- Total in pot so far: 96 chips\n- Opponent raises all-in with 32 chips (they only have 32 total)\n- So they raise by 32, making it 64 to match their 32 + 32 raise = 64 total from them\n- I posted 64 already, so I would need to call... actually, if they go all-in for 32 total, and I already posted 64, then I don't need to call anything more.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at the numbers again:\n- Pot: 430 chips\n- Amount to call: 302\n- Minimum raise to: 668\n- My stack: 480\n\nIf the pot is 430 and I need to call 302, then there's currently 128 in the pot (430 - 302 = 128). This makes sense: SB 32 + BB 64 + something else = 128. The \"something else\" could be the opponent's raise amount.\n\nLet me try another interpretation: The opponent posted SB (32), then raised by 366. But they only have 32 chips, so the maximum they can raise is 32. The system might be misreporting, OR the 366 is the total bet, not the raise amount.\n\nActually, I think the most logical interpretation is:\n- Opponent posted SB: 32\n- I posted BB: 64\n- Opponent then raised all-in for their remaining 32 chips (since that's all they have)\n- So the total from opponent is 32 (SB) + 32 (raise) = 64\n- I have posted 64, so the action is back to me and I need to... actually, if I already matched their 64 with my BB, then the betting round should be complete.\n\nI'm going to assume the system is working correctly and the numbers are:\n- Pot: 430\n- To call: 302\n- This means there's 128 already in the pot that I contributed (my BB plus maybe some other amount)\n\nGiven"

            "reasoning_content": "We have Qc Kc on button, stack 366 (5.7 BB). Small blind posted 32, big blind 64. Pot 96. Amount to call 32 (to call big blind? Actually button is SB? Wait position: BTN seat5, but they posted SB 32? That seems off: they are BTN but posted SB? Maybe they are SB because they are seat5? Actually blinds: SB 32, BB 64. The actions: seat5 post_sb 32, seat1 post_bb 64. So seat5 is SB (small blind) not button? But they said Position: BTN (Seat5). Might be mislabel. Anyway they are in SB with Qc Kc, 5.7 BB, facing BB of 64. Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., raise total to 128). So they can call 32 to see flop, or raise to 128, or fold.\n\nGiven stack short 5.7 BB, Qc Kc is a strong hand, especially suited connectors high. In short stack, typical play is to shove all-in (or raise max). Minimum raise is 128, which is about 2 BB raise (to 128 total). With 5.7 BB, a raise to 128 is less than half stack, leaving about 238 chips left. Might be better to go all-in to maximize fold equity. However the legal action only includes raise to any amount? It says raise to total amount. Minimum raise to 128, but can raise higher up to stack? Likely yes. So we could raise to 366 (all-in). That is typical.\n\nBut consider opponent: seat1 Kimi-K2 with 480 chips, likely big stack. In SB, we could shove to put pressure. Qc Kc is good equity vs any random hand. So all-in.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 366 (or maybe 366? Actually all-in is 366 chips total, but we already posted 32 as SB, so remaining 334. Raise total to 366? Usually raise total includes your existing contribution? In this format, \"raise_to\" is total amount you're putting in (including call). So all-in total is 366. So raise_to 366.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

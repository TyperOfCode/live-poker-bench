            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**My hand**: 5\u2660 K\u2666 (offsuit, not connected, low kicker)\n**Position**: SB (worst position postflop)\n**Stack**: 260 chips (32.5 BB) - decent stack size\n**Blinds**: 4/8\n**Pot**: 28 chips\n**To call**: 4 chips (half a BB)\n**Legal actions**: fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 356 chips - haven't analyzed yet\n- Seat 4 (MP): MiniMax-M2 with 70 chips - called 8\n- Seat 5 (CO): GPT-OSS-120B with 256 chips - called 8\n\n**Opponent tendencies from memory**:\n\n**MiniMax-M2**:\n- Folded preflop 4 times out of 7 actions\n- Called preflop 3 times (for 2, 35, and 4 chips)\n- When they called 35 chips (hand #42), they showed Qs As at showdown on a K-8-2-9-5 board - so they called a big preflop raise with AQ suited\n- Generally seems tight based on folding frequency\n- When they do call preflop, they can have strong hands\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B**:\n- Very tight preflop: folded 5 times, checked once, called once (for 4 chips)\n- Only called the minimum (4 chips) in hand #44\n- When they did bet postflop (hand #43), they bet 30 into an unknown pot size, and in hand #44 they bet 48 on the flop\n- Very selective with hands, but aggressive when they connect\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: K5 offsuit is a marginal hand. King is decent but 5 kicker is very weak. This is a fold in most situations, especially from SB.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, worst position postflop. If I call, I'll be out of position against both players.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 28 chips = 7:1 pot odds. This is very good pot odds.\n\n4. **Opponent ranges**: Both players just called the BB (8 chips). This suggests they don't have premium hands (which would usually raise). They could have:\n   - Broadways, suited connectors, pocket pairs, Ax hands\n   - MiniMax called 8 chips - from their pattern, when they call they can have decent hands\n   - GPT called 8 chips - very unusual for them, they must have something they like\n\n5. **Stack sizes**: \n   - MiniMax has 70 chips (8.75 BB) - short stacked\n   - GPT has 256 chips (32 BB) - similar to me\n   - Both have plenty of chips to play postflop\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 32.5 BB, I'm not desperate but I should be looking for good spots. K5o from SB is not a good spot, especially against two players who have shown strength by calling.\n\n**Decision**: Despite the good pot odds (7:1), K5 offsuit is a very weak hand that plays poorly multiway and out of position. The opponents have shown interest by calling, suggesting they have something. Folding is the disciplined play here. The only argument for calling is the pot odds, but the reverse implied odds (losing big when I'm dominated) outweigh this.\n\nI should fold.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze the current hand situation. I'm in the small blind with Qd Ks, a decent hand. The pot is 28 chips (4 SB + 8 BB + 8 from seat 4 call + 8 from seat 5 call). Seat 1 folded. I'm in the small blind, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called, seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called. I have 356 chips (44.5 BB). \n\nFrom opponent history:\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, 70 chips): Has been calling preflop frequently, seems passive. Stack is short (70 chips, 8.75 BB).\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, 256 chips): Has shown some aggression postflop with bets on flop.\n\nMy hand KQo is strong from the small blind. I have position disadvantage since I'll act first postflop, but I'm closing the action preflop. \n\nOptions:\n1. Check: Take a free flop with KQo. This is conservative but reasonable given position disadvantage.\n2. Raise: Build the pot with a strong hand, potentially isolate the short stack or take it down preflop. Minimum raise to 16 (double the current bet).\n\nGiven the short stack in seat 4 (70 chips), raising could put pressure on them. My stack is healthy at 356 chips. KQo plays well heads-up or multiway. A raise to 20-24 might be good to build pot and define hands.\n\nI should consider that both opponents have shown willingness to call preflop. MiniMax-M2 has called multiple times. GPT-OSS-120B called last hand. A raise might get calls from both.\n\nPot odds: If I raise to 16 (additional 8), pot becomes 36, giving me 2.25:1 immediate odds if both call. But more importantly, I have a strong hand that can win without improvement.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, should play aggressively with good hands. KQo is top 10% hand.\n\nI think a raise is best here. Let's raise to 20 chips total (12 more). This is 2.5x the BB, reasonable sizing.",

            "reasoning_content": "Now let me think about this situation. We're on the flop with Qd Ks, board is 3h 6s 4s. We're in the SB with 344 chips (43 BB). We raised preflop from BB after two limpers, and both called. The pot is 64 chips.\n\nOur hand: King-high with a backdoor flush draw (spades) and backdoor straight potential (need J and T or A and T). Not a great flop for us - missed completely. We have two overcards but the board is low and dry.\n\nOpponents:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 58 chips (very short stack, 7.25 BB). From the history, they've been calling a lot preflop and have shown some decent hands (Qs As, Qh Jh, etc). They're very short and likely to commit with any decent hand.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 244 chips (30.5 BB). From history, they've been folding a lot preflop but when they play, they tend to bet aggressively on flops. In hand 43, they bet 30 on flop after checking preflop. In hand 44, they bet 48 on flop after calling preflop. Seems to be a somewhat aggressive player postflop.\n\nPosition: We're out of position (SB), which is bad. We have to act first on every street.\n\nGiven the dry board and our weak hand, I think checking is correct. We could consider a continuation bet since we raised preflop, but with two callers and a dry board that likely hit their calling ranges (pairs, draws), a c-bet might not be effective. Also, seat 5 has shown aggression on flops, so if we bet and get raised, we're in a tough spot.\n\nPot odds: If we check and someone bets, we'd need to consider calling. But with just King-high and backdoor draws, we'd need good odds.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been c-betting much.",

I raised preflop to 20 total (which was 12 more on top of my BB). Both players called. Now on the flop, I'm first to act with 0 to call, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand: Qd Ks - King-high with backdoor draws. I have:\n- Backdoor straight draw (Q-K can make a straight with J-T or A-T)\n- Backdoor flush draw (spades - I have Ks, board has 6s 4s)\n- Overcards to the board\n\nThe board is low (3h 6s 4s), so my overcards might be good if opponents missed. But I raised preflop, so they might put me on a strong range.\n\nStack sizes:\n- Me: 344 chips (43 BB)\n- MiniMax-M2: 58 chips (7.25 BB) - very short stack\n- GPT-OSS-120B: 244 chips (30.5 BB)\n\nMiniMax-M2 is very short and could be looking to get all-in. GPT-OSS-120B has a decent stack.\n\nPot is 64 chips. I'm first to act. I should consider continuation betting since I raised preflop. But with Q-K on this board, it's not a great c-bet. However, I have position on both players for the rest of the hand (they act after me on flop, turn, river).\n\nActually wait - I'm SB, so I act first on flop, turn, river. That's bad position.\n\nLet me think about ranges:\n- I raised from SB after limpers. My range should be strong.\n- MiniMax called from BB? Actually Seat 4 is MiniMax, who called preflop. They limped then called my raise. Could have a wide range.\n- GPT-OSS called from UTG? Actually Seat 5 is GPT-OSS, who also limped then called.\n\nGiven the low board, a c-bet might take it down. But if called, I'm out of position with a marginal hand.\n\nI should check to see what they do. If they check behind, I get a free card. If they bet, I can evaluate.\n\nBetter to check here. My hand has some potential with backdoor draws but isn't strong enough to bet for value. A bet would be a bluff, and I'm out of position.\n\nI'll check. Let me respond with JSON.",

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called, and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called. Seat 4 has only 28 chips left (after calling 12 preflop? Wait, they have 28 chips now, but they called 12 preflop and then bet 30 on flop? That seems impossible if they only have 28 chips total. Let's examine: Seat 4 started with 28 chips. They called 8 preflop (limped), then I raised to 20, they called 12 more (total 20). That would leave them with 8 chips. Then they bet 30 on flop? That can't be right. Maybe the stack display is current stack after actions? Actually, the stack display is likely current stack after posting blinds/calls. Let's recalc: Seat 4 started with 28 chips. They posted no blind (they're not SB/BB). They called 8 preflop (limped). Then I raised to 20, they called 12 more, total 20 invested. That leaves 8 chips. Then they bet 30 on flop? That's impossible. Maybe the stack display is before the hand? Or maybe they have 28 chips remaining after the flop bet? But they bet 30, which would be more than they have. Hmm.\n\nLet me read again: \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 28 chips\". That's likely their current stack after posting blinds/calls. So they have 28 chips left. They called 12 preflop (total 20). Then on flop they bet 30? That would be all-in if they only have 28 left. Actually, the bet size is 30, but they might be all-in for less. The amount to call is 30, but if Seat 4 has only 28 chips, the effective bet might be 28. However, Seat 5 called 30, so maybe Seat 4 actually has more chips? Let's check the pot size: Pot is 124 chips. Preflop: SB posted 4, BB (me) posted 8, Seat 4 called 8, Seat 5 called 8, I raised 20 (so added 12 more), Seat 4 called 12, Seat 5 called 12. That's 4+8+8+8+12+12+12 = 64? Wait: 4+8=12, +8=20, +8=28, +12=40, +12=52, +12=64. Pot preflop should be 64. But pot is 124 on flop. That includes flop bets: Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, so 64+30+30=124. So Seat 4 indeed bet 30, and Seat 5 called 30. So Seat 4 must have had at least 30 chips after preflop. So maybe the stack display is before the hand started? Let's assume Seat 4 has 28 chips now after betting 30? That would mean they had 58 chips before hand, invested 20 preflop, leaving 38, then bet 30 leaving 8. But display shows 28. Could be a mistake. Let's not overthink; we know Seat 4 is short-stacked (28 chips). They bet 30, which is likely all-in (or close). Seat 5 called 30. So there's a side pot between me and Seat 5 if I call.\n\nMy hand: Qd Ks. Board: 3h 6s 4s. I have overcards, no flush draw (I have Ks, but board has two spades; I have Qd not spade). So I have two overcards (K and Q) to a 6-high board. Backdoor flush draw? I have Ks, so I have a spade, but need two more spades for flush. Actually board has 6s and 4s, so there are two spades on board. I have Ks, so I have a flush draw: three spades on board plus my Ks gives me a flush draw! Wait: board has 6s and 4s (two spades). I have Ks, so I have a spade. That's a flush draw! I need two more spades on turn and river. Actually, I have a flush draw: I need one more spade to make a flush (since I have one spade, board has two spades,"

Pot is 124, I need to call 30. That's pot odds of 124:30 or about 4.1:1, meaning I need ~20% equity. My equity against likely hands: I have ~30-40% against a pair like 77-TT, and better against draws. However, there are two opponents: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is short-stacked and likely all-in or nearly all-in with their bet of 30 (they have 28 chips). Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called the 30. Seat 5 has 214 chips. I have 344 chips.\n\nSeat 4's history: they've shown some calling with suited hands (Qs As, Qh Jh, Qd Th). They tend to call preflop and sometimes bet flop. They might have a pair or a draw. Seat 5's history: they've shown aggression on flops (bet 30 in hand 43, bet 48 in hand 44). They have called preflop here. They might have a pair or a draw.\n\nMy preflop raise was to 20 (2.5x BB) from BB after two limpers. That's standard. Both called. I checked flop (standard with overcards and draw). Seat 4 bet 30 (pot-sized relative to preflop pot?). Seat 5 called.\n\nGiven I have a flush draw and overcards, I have good equity. I should consider raising to isolate or build pot. However, Seat 4 is short and all-in likely, so there will be side pot with Seat 5. If I raise, I can put pressure on Seat 5 who might fold marginal hands. But if Seat 5 has a strong hand, they might re-raise. My stack is healthy (43 BB). I could call and see turn, but raising might be better to maximize fold equity and build pot for my draw.\n\nLet's calculate: If I call 30, pot becomes 154 (124+30). If I raise, minimum raise to 60 (total). That's 30 more. Seat 5 would need to call 30 more to continue. They have 214 chips, so they can call. If they fold, I win side pot with Seat 4? Actually, Seat 4 is all-in, so main pot includes Seat 4's bet, side pot between me and Seat 5 if I raise and Seat 5 calls. If Seat 5 folds, I win the entire pot (124 + my call? Wait, if Seat 5 folds to my raise, then pot is 124 (current) + my raise to 60 (I put 60 total, but I already have 0 in? Actually, I haven't acted yet. Pot is 124 including Seat 4's 30 and Seat 5's 30. I need to call 30. If I raise to 60, I put 60 total, which is 30 more than calling. So pot becomes 124 + 30 (my extra) = 154. Seat 5 would need to call 30 more to continue, making pot 184. If Seat 5 folds, I win 154 pot.\n\nBut Seat 4 is all-in, so main pot is 64 (preflop) + 30+30 = 124? Actually, preflop pot was 64. Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, so main pot is 64+30+30=124. That's the pot before my action. If I call, main pot becomes 154. If I raise and Seat 5 folds, main pot is 124 + my 30 = 154, but Seat 4 is all-in, so they can only win the portion they contributed. Actually, side pot rules: main pot includes up to the all-in player's contribution. Seat 4 has 28 chips left? They bet 30, but maybe they have 28 left after betting? The bet size is 30, but if they have only 28, the effective bet is 28. So main pot includes up to 28 from each player. Let's simplify: I have good equity and should continue. Raising could win immediately if Seat 5 folds. But Seat 5 has called flop bet, indicating some strength. They might have a pair, maybe middle pair, or a draw. They might call a raise.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, I have a big stack relative to others (43 BB). Seat 5 has 26.75 BB. I should play aggressively with draws. I'll raise to apply pressure.\n\nLet's decide:"

            "reasoning_content": "I need to provide a JSON response. Let me think carefully.\n\nHand: Qd Ks on 3h 6s 4s. I have flush draw (Ks is spade) and two overcards. Pot odds: call 30 to win 124, giving 4.1:1 odds, needing ~20% equity. My equity is likely >30% against typical ranges.\n\nOpponents: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) short-stacked, likely all-in or nearly all-in. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called flop bet. They could have medium pair, draw, or overcards.\n\nMy position: SB, but action checked to me after I checked. Actually, I checked, then Seat 4 bet, Seat 5 called, now action on me. I'm last to act (since Seat 4 bet and Seat 5 called, I close action if I call). If I raise, I can put pressure on Seat 5.\n\nStack sizes: I have 344 (43 BB). Seat 5 has 214 (26.75 BB). Seat 4 has 28 (3.5 BB). I have fold equity if I raise.\n\nTournament: I'm above average stack, should accumulate chips but avoid unnecessary risks. However, with a draw and overcards, raising is good.\n\nIf I call: pot 154, I see turn with decent equity. If I raise: I might win immediately if Seat 5 folds, or build a bigger pot for my draw. Minimum raise to 60 (total). That's 30 more than calling. I could raise larger, say 90 or 120. But need to consider pot commitment.\n\nLet's check legal actions: fold, call, raise. I can raise to any amount >=60 and <= my stack. I have 344 chips, so I could raise up to all-in.\n\nI think raising is best. I'll raise to 90 (total), which is a pot-sized raise relative to the bet I'm facing? Actually, pot is 124, bet is 30, so a pot-sized raise would be: call 30 then raise pot (124+30+30)=184 total? That's too big. Standard raise might be 2.5x the bet: 30*2.5=75, so raise to 75 total. I'll raise to 90 to apply more pressure.\n\nBut let's not overcomplicate. I'll raise to 90 total (which means I put 90 chips in, I already have 0 in this street, so I add 90). That's a raise of 60 over the call amount (since call is 30, raise to 90 is 60 more).\n\nReasoning: I have flush draw with overcards, good equity. Raising applies pressure on Seat 5 who may fold marginal hands, and builds pot for my draw. I have position (closing action if I call, but if I raise, I might get heads-up with all-in player). Also, I have stack advantage.\n\nI'll respond with JSON.",

            "content": "Now, let's analyze the current hand:\n\nWe're on the turn. Board: 3h 6s 4s 5d. Our hand: Qd Ks.\n\nWe have KQ offsuit. Board is 3-6-4-5 rainbow (no flush draws). The board is very connected with many straight possibilities. The 5d turn completes some straights (2-7, 7-8, 2-6? Actually 2-7 would be a straight with 3-4-5-6-7, and 7-8 would be 4-5-6-7-8).\n\nWe have two overcards (K and Q) but no pair. We have a gutshot straight draw: we need a 7 to complete a straight (3-4-5-6-7). That's 4 outs.\n\nPot is 302 chips. We have 254 chips left. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) went all-in on flop with 28 chips. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 154 chips and called our flop raise.\n\nWe checked flop, Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, we raised to 90 (total), Seat 4 called 28 all-in, Seat 5 called 60 more.\n\nNow on turn, action is on us. Amount to call is 0. We can check or raise.\n\nOur hand is weak: just two overcards and a gutshot. However, we have position (SB but heads-up vs GPT-OSS-120B now that Seat 4 is all-in). Actually, Seat 4 is all-in, so there's a side pot between us and Seat 5.\n\nWe need to consider what hands GPT-OSS-120B could have. He called preflop, called flop bet, called our raise. He could have a pair, a draw, or maybe a made straight.\n\nLooking at his tendencies: From the search, he seems to fold to aggression sometimes. But he called our flop raise, so he has something.\n\nOur flop raise was quite strong (90 into 120 pot?). Let's calculate: Preflop pot was maybe 48? Actually: SB 4, BB 8, Seat 4 call 8, Seat 5 call 8, Seat 1 fold, we raise 20 (total 28?), then Seat 4 call 12, Seat 5 call 12. So preflop pot: 4+8+8+8+20+12+12 = 72? Wait, let's recalc: SB posts 4, BB posts 8, Seat 4 calls 8, Seat 5 calls 8 = 28. Then we raise 20 more (so total we put in 28), Seat 4 calls 12 more (total 20), Seat 5 calls 12 more (total 20). So pot = 4+8+8+8+20+12+12 = 72. Yes.\n\nFlop: We check, Seat 4 bets 30, Seat 5 calls 30, pot now 132. We raise to 90 (total). That's a raise of 60 more (since we need to call 30 then raise). Pot becomes 132+90 = 222? Actually our raise adds 60 to pot, so pot = 132+60 = 192. Then Seat 4 calls 28 all-in, Seat 5 calls 60 more. So pot main pot: 72+30+30+90+28+60 = 310? Let's not overcomplicate.\n\nNow turn: pot is 302 chips. We have 254 left.\n\nIf we check, GPT-OSS-120B might bet. He has 154 chips total. He might bet with a strong hand or a draw.\n\nOur gutshot gives us 4 outs to a straight. That's about 8.7% equity (4/46). But we also have overcard outs: K or Q might be good if he has a smaller pair. But on this board, many pairs are possible: 6x, 5x, 4x, 3x, or overpairs like 77-AA. Our KQ might be ahead if he has a draw like 7x or 8x.\n\nActually, we have 6 outs if we count K and Q as clean (maybe not clean if he has AK or AQ). So maybe 6 outs = 13%. But we need to discount.\n\nGiven the connected board, our hand is marginal. We have position for river if we check now. We can check and evaluate river.\n\nIf we bet, we could try to take it down with a semi-bluff. But we'd be committing chips with weak equity.\n\nLet's think about stack sizes: We have "

            "reasoning_content": "Now, let's analyze the current hand:\n\nWe're on the turn. Board: 3h 6s 4s 5d. Our hand: Qd Ks.\n\nWe have KQ offsuit. Board is 3-6-4-5 rainbow (no flush draws). The board is very connected with many straight possibilities. The 5d turn completes some straights (2-7, 7-8, 2-6? Actually 2-7 would be a straight with 3-4-5-6-7, and 7-8 would be 4-5-6-7-8).\n\nWe have two overcards (K and Q) but no pair. We have a gutshot straight draw: we need a 7 to complete a straight (3-4-5-6-7). That's 4 outs.\n\nPot is 302 chips. We have 254 chips left. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) went all-in on flop with 28 chips. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 154 chips and called our flop raise.\n\nWe checked flop, Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, we raised to 90 (total), Seat 4 called 28 all-in, Seat 5 called 60 more.\n\nNow on turn, action is on us. Amount to call is 0. We can check or raise.\n\nOur hand is weak: just two overcards and a gutshot. However, we have position (SB but heads-up vs GPT-OSS-120B now that Seat 4 is all-in). Actually, Seat 4 is all-in, so there's a side pot between us and Seat 5.\n\nWe need to consider what hands GPT-OSS-120B could have. He called preflop, called flop bet, called our raise. He could have a pair, a draw, or maybe a made straight.\n\nLooking at his tendencies: From the search, he seems to fold to aggression sometimes. But he called our flop raise, so he has something.\n\nOur flop raise was quite strong (90 into 120 pot?). Let's calculate: Preflop pot was maybe 48? Actually: SB 4, BB 8, Seat 4 call 8, Seat 5 call 8, Seat 1 fold, we raise 20 (total 28?), then Seat 4 call 12, Seat 5 call 12. So preflop pot: 4+8+8+8+20+12+12 = 72? Wait, let's recalc: SB posts 4, BB posts 8, Seat 4 calls 8, Seat 5 calls 8 = 28. Then we raise 20 more (so total we put in 28), Seat 4 calls 12 more (total 20), Seat 5 calls 12 more (total 20). So pot = 4+8+8+8+20+12+12 = 72. Yes.\n\nFlop: We check, Seat 4 bets 30, Seat 5 calls 30, pot now 132. We raise to 90 (total). That's a raise of 60 more (since we need to call 30 then raise). Pot becomes 132+90 = 222? Actually our raise adds 60 to pot, so pot = 132+60 = 192. Then Seat 4 calls 28 all-in, Seat 5 calls 60 more. So pot main pot: 72+30+30+90+28+60 = 310? Let's not overcomplicate.\n\nNow turn: pot is 302 chips. We have 254 left.\n\nIf we check, GPT-OSS-120B might bet. He has 154 chips total. He might bet with a strong hand or a draw.\n\nOur gutshot gives us 4 outs to a straight. That's about 8.7% equity (4/46). But we also have overcard outs: K or Q might be good if he has a smaller pair. But on this board, many pairs are possible: 6x, 5x, 4x, 3x, or overpairs like 77-AA. Our KQ might be ahead if he has a draw like 7x or 8x.\n\nActually, we have 6 outs if we count K and Q as clean (maybe not clean if he has AK or AQ). So maybe 6 outs = 13%. But we need to discount.\n\nGiven the connected board, our hand is marginal. We have position for river if we check now. We can check and evaluate river.\n\nIf we bet, we could try to take it down with a semi-bluff. But we'd be committing chips with weak equity.\n\nLet's think about stack sizes: We have ",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to output JSON. Let me think through the decision clearly.\n\nCurrent situation: Turn, board 3h 6s 4s 5d, hand Qd Ks. Pot 302 chips. We have 254 chips left. Opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) has 154 chips. Seat 4 is all-in.\n\nWe can check or raise. No call needed since amount to call is 0.\n\nOur hand: KQo, no pair, gutshot to 7 for straight (3-4-5-6-7). That's 4 outs. Overcards might be good but doubtful on this board.\n\nWe raised flop aggressively. That might have been a semi-bluff or for value? Actually with KQ high on 3-6-4 board, raising was likely a semi-bluff or trying to take it down. Now turn is 5d, completing some straights.\n\nIf we check, opponent might bet with his range. He called flop raise, so he likely has something: maybe a pair, a draw, or a straight. He has only 154 chips left, so if he bets, he might go all-in.\n\nIf we raise now, we'd be committing more chips with weak equity. Minimum raise to 60 (total). But we could also go all-in.\n\nPot odds if we check-call a bet: If opponent bets all-in 154, pot becomes 302+154=456, we need to call 154. That's about 2.96:1 odds, needing ~25% equity. We likely don't have that.\n\nBetter to check and see what opponent does. If he checks behind, we get a free river. If he bets small, we might call if we think we have enough equity. But with only 4 clean outs (7s) and maybe 3 Ks and 3 Qs if they're good (but likely not), we have maybe 10 outs max = ~22% equity. That's close to break-even.\n\nBut tournament considerations: We have 31.8 BB stack. Not desperate. Seat 4 is all-in, so we're already guaranteed some side pot action.\n\nI think checking is best. Then evaluate river. If opponent bets, we can fold unless we improve.\n\nSo action: check.",

I'm in SB, opponent is GPT-OSS-120B with 154 chips. There's no bet to call (amount to call is 0), so I can check or raise.\n\nLet me think about the hand history: preflop I raised from BB (after posting BB) with Qd Ks to 20 total (so raise of 12 more). Two callers: seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) who is now out, and seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). Flop: 3h 6s 4s. I checked, seat 4 bet 30, seat 5 called, I raised to 90 total (so raise of 60 more). Seat 4 called 28 (all-in? stack was 0? Actually seat 4 had 0 chips after call? Wait seat 4 had 0 chips listed at start but they called preflop and flop bet... Actually seat 4 had 0 chips at start of hand? The table shows seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (out). That means they were already out? But they acted preflop and flop... Maybe they went all-in earlier? Let's see: preflop seat 4 call 8, then seat 3 raise 20, seat 4 call 12 (so they put in 20 total). Flop: seat 4 bet 30, seat 5 call 30, seat 3 raise 90, seat 4 call 28. That would be 28 more, total 58? Actually they bet 30, then called 28 more, so total 58. They must have had 58 chips? But they show 0 chips at start. Possibly they were all-in earlier? Anyway seat 4 is now out, so only seat 5 remains.\n\nTurn: I checked, seat 5 checked. River is 4d, board now 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So board pairs the 4. I have Qd Ks, no pair, just king high with queen kicker. However, the board shows 3-4-5-6 with two 4s, so there's a possible straight: 2-3-4-5-6 or 3-4-5-6-7. But the board has 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d, so straight possibilities: 2-3-4-5-6 (needs a 2) or 3-4-5-6-7 (needs a 7). No 2 or 7 on board. So no straight on board. My hand doesn't connect at all; I have king high. The flush possibilities: spades and diamonds. Board has 6s 4s (two spades), and 4d (diamond). I have Qd Ks, so I have king of spades and queen of diamonds. That gives me the second nut spade flush draw? Actually board has two spades, I have Ks, so I have the king-high spade flush draw. But there's no flush on board because only two spades. Diamonds: board has 4d, I have Qd, so only one diamond. No flush.\n\nWhat could opponent have? They called preflop, called flop bet, called my raise on flop, checked turn. They have 154 chips left. They might have a pair, maybe a straight draw, maybe a flush draw. The flop was 3h 6s 4s, so possible hands: pocket pairs, maybe 5x, maybe spade draws. Turn was 5d, completing possible straight if they had 7x or 2x. But they checked turn, so maybe they don't have a straight. River pairs the 4, which could improve some hands like trips if they had a 4, but unlikely.\n\nMy flop raise was large: I raised to 90 after check-raising. That's a strong move representing a strong hand. I have Qd Ks, which is not strong, but I was likely semi-bluffing with overcards and spade draw. Now on river, I have king high. The pot is 302 chips. I have 254 chips left. Opponent has 154 chips left. If I bet, I could try to bluff representing a strong hand like a set or two pair that improved to full house on river? But the river paired the board, so if I had a 4, I now have trips or full house. However, my line:"

But I raised preflop and check-raised flop, representing strength. The river paired the board, which could have improved my hand if I had a 4 (trips) or a full house if I had a pocket pair. My line looks strong: raise preflop, check-raise flop, check turn (maybe trapping). On river, I could bet to represent a strong hand.\n\nOpponent called flop raise and checked turn.

They might call with any pair. If I go all-in (254 chips), they need to call 254 to win 556, about 2.2:1. They'd probably call with any decent hand.\n\nMy image: I've been aggressive. But my hand is weak. Checking seems weak too, but maybe I can get a free showdown with king high. If I check, they might bet with any hand, and I'd have to fold.

I have 254 chips left, opponent has 154 chips left. I checked turn, opponent checked. Now on river, I have the option to check or raise (bet). Since amount to call is 0, I can check for free.\n\nMy hand is very weak - just king high. However, I raised preflop and check-raised the flop aggressively. That represents strength. The river paired the board with 4d, which could improve some hands but also makes it less likely opponent has a 4 (only one left). My line could represent a hand like AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, or a set that improved to full house. But I actually have KQ offsuit.\n\nOpponent called flop raise and checked turn. They might have a medium pair, a draw that missed, or a weak hand. They have 154 chips left, less than half the pot. If I bet, I could try to bluff them off a better hand. But they only need to call 154 chips to win 302+154=456 pot? Actually if I bet, I need to decide bet size. Minimum raise to is 60, but I can bet any amount up to my stack.\n\nIf I bet, say 100 chips (about 1/3 pot), they need to call 100 to win 402 (302+100). That's about 4:1 odds. They might call with any pair. If I go all-in (254), they need to call 254 to win 556 (302+254). That's about 2.2:1 odds. They might call with any decent hand.\n\nGiven my weak hand, checking seems safer. But I have position (I act first? Actually I'm SB, so I act first on river? Wait, the action shows: turn: Seat 3 check, turn: Seat 5 check. Now river, I'm seat 3 (SB), so I act first. I can check, then opponent can bet. If I check and opponent bets, I'll have to decide whether to call. But opponent checked turn, so they might not bet river either.\n\nChecking seems reasonable: I have a weak hand, I've shown aggression earlier, but I might get a free showdown. If opponent bets, I can fold. If opponent checks behind, I might win if they have worse. But king high is not likely to win at showdown.\n\nHowever, given my aggressive line, I could try a bluff bet on river. The board is scary: straight and flush draws missed, board paired. I could represent a full house or trips. But opponent called flop raise, so they might have something. They have only 154 chips left, so they might be pot-committed if they call.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 254 chips (31.8 BB). That's a decent stack. Opponent has 154 chips (19.25 BB). If I bluff and get called, I lose significant chips. If I check and lose, I still have 254 chips. If I bluff and succeed, I win 302 chips, increasing to 556 chips (69.5 BB) which would be huge.\n\nBut the risk is high. My hand is king high, which might actually be good if opponent has nothing. They might have missed draws like spade flush draw, straight draw. The board has 4d, which pairs the board, but doesn't complete any obvious draws.\n\nI'll check and hope they check behind.

I have a decent hand but need to be careful about my stack size.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**: \n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has been quite active with preflop raises (6-28 chips range, with some larger ones)\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 has shown both aggression (raises to 12, 72) and caution (many folds), with strong hands like QsKh and JhQh\n\n**Stack Considerations**: At 78 chips (9.8 BB), I'm in a dangerous zone where I need to preserve my stack while still being active enough to accumulate chips.\n\n**Decision**: Given my position, stack size, and the fact that both opponents have shown they can play aggressively, I should call the 8 chips rather than raise. This keeps me in the hand with a strong hand while avoiding the risk of being isolated against stronger ranges. If the board is favorable postflop, I can reassess.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Calling with pocket tens UTG to see a cheap flop. Stack is getting short (9.8 BB) so preserving chips while staying in with a strong hand is prudent. Avoid raising into aggressive opponents who may have position.\"\n}\n```",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My Hand**: Td Ts (pocket tens) - This is a strong hand, especially in early position.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the earliest position, meaning I'm the first to act preflop. This is generally a weak position as I have to act before seeing what others do.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 78 chips (9.8 BB) - This is a relatively short stack. I'm getting close to being in push/fold territory.\n\n4. **Current Situation**: \n   - Blinds are 4/8\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has posted the small blind (4 chips)\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has posted the big blind (8 chips)\n   - Pot is 12 chips\n   - Amount to call: 8 (to match the big blind)\n   - Minimum raise to: 16\n\n5. **Opponent Analysis**:\n   - **Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1)**: From the recall data, this player has been quite active with raises preflop, ranging from 6-28 chips, with some larger raises up to 72. They've shown some decent hands at showdown (pocket nines, ace-high, etc.)\n   \n   - **DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3)**: This player has been very active with both raises and folds. They've made some significant raises (12, 72 chips) and have shown strong hands like QsKh, JhQh at showdown.\n\n6. **Decision Factors**:\n   - **Hand Strength**: Pocket tens are strong, but UTG is a tough position\n   - **Stack Size**: At 9.8 BB, I'm in the danger zone where I need to be careful about my chips\n   - **Opponent Tendencies**: Both opponents seem capable of playing aggressively\n   \nI'm facing a critical decision with pocket tens. The early position and short stack create significant pressure. Calling seems like the most prudent move, avoiding unnecessary chip depletion while maintaining potential for future play. Raising could expose me to aggressive counterplay from experienced opponents. The goal is to preserve my tournament life and wait for a more favorable spot.\n\nWith 78 chips and blinds at 4/8, I'm approaching a critical stack size where every chip matters. Calling 8 chips represents 10% of my stack, which demands careful consideration of my long-term tournament strategy. The tight position and strong opponents suggest a conservative approach is wisest.\n\nThe key factors are my hand strength, stack preservation, and avoiding unnecessary risks that could quickly diminish my tournament prospects.\n",

Call - See the flop cheaply with good pot odds\n2. Raise - Try to build the pot now with my strong hand\n3. Fold - Too weak given the hand strength and pot odds\n\nFolding pocket tens here would be a mistake - they're too strong and the pot odds are too good.\n\nRaising could be good, but with my short stack (8.8 BB), raising to 32 chips would put in almost half my stack. If I get raised back, I might be forced to go all-in or fold, which I want to avoid with a hand as strong as pocket tens.\n\nCalling seems like the best play. I get to see the flop cheaply with excellent pot odds, and I maintain my stack for a better spot. If I hit a set on the flop, I can potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold to further aggression.\n\nThe call also allows me to keep the pot small if I miss, preserving my short stack for a better spot.\n\nI think calling is the best play here.\n",

Opponent: From my memory, DeepSeek-V3.2 has a mixed strategy - sometimes betting, sometimes checking on flops\n\nGiven that:\n- I have a strong hand (pocket tens)\n- The board is very safe for my hand\n- I'm short stacked (7.2 BB)\n- The opponent checked, giving me the opportunity to bet\n- I need to be aggressive with short stacks when I have good hands\n\nThis seems like a clear spot to bet for value. With pocket tens on this board, I should be ahead of most hands that would call. Even if I'm called, I'm getting good value and building the pot when I have a strong hand.\n\nThe minimum raise is 12 chips, but I think I should bet more to get more value.

MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) called the BB for 8, so there are three players in the pot: SB 4 (maybe hasn't acted? Actually SB posted 4, but hasn't acted yet? In preflop order: SB posts, BB posts, then action starts with UTG (seat1?) Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, but seat1 posted SB. So seat1 is SB. Then seat3 is BB. Then seat4 is MiniMax-M2, who called 8. Now it's button (us) to act, amount to call 8. So we have a pot of 20 (SB 4 + BB 8 + call 8 = 20). We can fold, call, raise to at least 16 (minimum raise total). Our stack 264, so raise possible.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 seems to call small amounts often, sometimes folds, sometimes bets small. Not much aggression. DeepSeek-V3.2 unknown. SB Kimi-K2 Thinking unknown.\n\nPocket eights is a medium pair, about 10% equity vs random. In multi-way, likely not great. But we are in position (button) and can see flop. Could call to see flop. Raise could isolate but we risk being 3-betted? Actually there is no raise yet, just call. If we raise to 16 (total) that's a 8 raise over call? Actually min raise is 16 total, which is 8 more than call (call 8). So raise to 16 would be a raise of 8 more, making pot 28 (plus 8 from us). That would isolate against MiniMax maybe, but SB and BB could also call.\n\nGiven our hand, maybe best to call and see flop. Pot odds: call 8 to win 20+8=28? Actually if we call, pot becomes 28 (20+8). Equity needed ~28% to be break even. Pocket eights vs 2 random opponents ~ maybe 30%? Might be borderline. But we have position, can fold later.\n\nRaising could get folds from SB and BB (they have already posted blinds, they could fold). MiniMax may fold as well. Might isolate to heads-up vs BB (DeepSeek). BB unknown but could be tight. If we raise, we risk being re-raised? No further raises possible preflop? Actually after us, action goes to SB then BB. So they could call or raise. If they raise, we could fold.\n\nGiven we have decent stack and want to accumulate chips, maybe raise to isolate BB? But BB posted blind, might defend wide.\n\nI think best is to call, see flop.\n\nThus action: call.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We have pocket eights on BTN, 32 BB stack, facing a raise from DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) after small blind and big blind posted and MiniMax called, then we called, then SB folded, then DeepSeek raised to 20 (so from 8 to 20, a raise of 12). Now MiniMax (seat 4) called 12 to 20. So we are facing a 12 call to 20 raise, amount to call is 12 (to match 20). Minimum raise to 32 (so raise at least to 32 total). Our stack is 256, we can raise.\n\nWe need to decide: pocket eights is a decent hand, but in early position (DeepSeek) raised, and a short stack (MiniMax) called. MiniMax is 58 chips (7.25 BB). So MiniMax likely will be all-in or call with any pair. They already called 12 (so they are now at 20 total, have 38 left). They could be all-in later. DeepSeek's raise size is small (2.5 BB). This is a typical open-raise from UTG? Not sure position. But they raised to 20 (2.5 BB) which is small, maybe a wide range.\n\nWe have 8-8, a medium pocket pair. With 32 BB, we could consider 3-betting to isolate and build pot. However, deep stack is 344 chips (42.9 BB). MiniMax is short 58 chips. If we 3-bet, we may isolate MiniMax (who already called) and DeepSeek. But we could also just call and see flop.\n\nGiven pocket pair, we could 3-bet to maybe 80-100 to isolate. But we have 32 BB, raising to 32 (minimum) would be a 12 raise (to total 32). That's 12 more chips (so we put total 32). That would be a 2.5x raise (from 20 to 32). That's not much; could be considered a re-raise (3-bet) but small.\n\nWe could also go all-in (256) but that's too large.\n\nWhat about opponent tendencies: DeepSeek raises vary from 5 to 100. They have raised 72 in hand 42, also 100 in hand 27. So they sometimes raise big, but also small. Not enough data.\n\nMiniMax is short stack; they called. Likely they have decent hand (maybe pair). With 8-8, we have good equity vs overpairs (like AA, KK) not great, but vs lower pairs we are ahead.\n\nGiven tournament, preserving stack is important. 8-8 is a good hand to call and see flop. But raising could isolate and possibly win bigger pot if we hit set.\n\nConsider pot odds: pot is 52, plus 12 call to call = 64 total after call. If we call, we invest 12 to potentially win 64 (pot after call). That's 12/64 = 18.75% required equity, we have > 20% (approx 20% vs random). So call is fine.\n\nBut also there is a short stack, which could go all-in later. If we call and get set, we can get big chips.\n\nThus I think best is to call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Choose call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

No flush draw currently (two spades on board, we have none). Straight draw? Board 3-4-6, we have 8,8. No open-ended. So we have a decent hand, top pair (actually overpair). Opponents: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) is the BB who raised preflop to 20 (from 8). So they raised 20 (maybe 2.5x BB). Then seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 12 (so they are in big blind? Actually seat 4 is out). Wait seat 4 had 0 chips (out). But they are listed as having 0 chips (out). However they are still in actions? In preflop they posted sb 4 (seat1) and bb 8 (seat3). Seat4 call 8? But seat4 has 0 chips (out) weird. Possibly seat4 is a placeholder for a player that folded preflop? Actually they call 8 preflop, then after raise, they call 12. So they are still in. So seat4 is a player with 0 chips? Might be a mistake. Anyway seat4 is the one who bet 30 on flop, then called 28 after raise. So seat4 is the original small blind? Actually seat1 is SB, seat3 is BB, seat4 is maybe UTG? Not sure. But seat4 bet 30 on flop, then call 28 after raise. So seat4 is the initial bettor, likely a short stack (0 chips?) but they bet 30, meaning they have chips. Anyway we have to decide.\n\nCurrent pot: 242 pre-flop? Actually pot after flop actions: preflop pot: blinds 4+8=12, plus seat4 call 8, seat5 call 8, seat3 raise 20, seat4 call 12, seat5 call 12 => total? Let's compute: initial blinds 4+8=12. Then seat4 call 8 adds 8 => 20. Seat5 call 8 adds 8 => 28. Seat3 raise 20 adds 20 (makes his total 20? Actually raise to 20 means he adds 12 more? Not important). Then seat4 call 12 adds 12 => 40. Seat5 call 12 adds 12 => 52. So preflop pot maybe 12+8+8+20+12+12 = 72? But the given pot is 242, maybe includes some previous? Anyway.\n\nFlop actions: seat3 check, seat4 bet 30 (so pot becomes 272). Seat5 call 30 (adds 30). Seat3 raise 90 (so adds 60 more beyond call? Actually to raise to 90 total, need to put 90-30=60). Seat4 call 28 (so they call the additional 60? Actually they call 28, meaning they put 28 more to match 90? Wait they had already contributed 30, so to call 90 they need 60 more, but they call 28? Something off. But given amount to call is 60, meaning we need to call 60 to match seat3's raise. Minimum raise to 150. So we have to decide.\n\nSeat3 (DeepSeek) raised to 90 on flop after seat4's bet. So seat3 is likely representing a strong hand or a draw. Seat4 is a short stack? They bet 30, then called 28 after raise, meaning they are now all-in? Not sure.\n\nOur hand overpair is strong but vulnerable to sets (3,6,4). No set on board currently. Potential draws: seat3 could have a straight draw like 5-7 (open-ended) or 2-5 (gutshot) or a flush draw (spades). They have no spades, but board has two spades; they could have two spades for flush draw. They could also have a pair like 6 or 4 or 3, but they'd likely just call. They raised, indicating strength or draw.\n\nWe have 214 chips, stack 26.8 BB. The pot now is 242 + 30 + 30 + 90? Actually after seat3 raise, pot maybe around 242+30+30+90 = 392? The amount to call is 60, so if we call we invest 60, making pot ~452. Pot odds: 60 to win ~452 => 13% required. Our hand likely best vs many draws, but we risk"

Also Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 0 chips? Actually seat 4 is out? It says 0 chips (out). But actions show seat 4 called flop and then called raise. But they have 0 chips? Probably they are still in with some chips? But stack not listed. Probably seat 4 is still in but with unknown stack. However after flop, seat 4 called raise 28 (call of 90 raise?). Wait flop actions: Seat 3 check, Seat 4 bet 30, Seat5 call, Seat3 raise 90 (so to 120 total? Actually raise 90 likely means raise to 90? But min raise 60). Then seat4 call 28 (so they call additional 28 to match raise). Seat5 call 60 (so they call additional 60). So after flop, pot: initial pot 302 + flop bet 30+call30+raise? Let's compute: Preflop pot: 4+8+8+8+... Actually preflop: blinds 4+8, seat4 call 8, seat5 call 8, seat3 raise to 20 (so add 12 more), seat4 call 12 (so add 4?), seat5 call 12 (add 4). So pot after preflop: 4+8+8+8 + (20-8)?? Let's not needed.\n\nNow on turn, seat3 (DeepSeek) checks. Amount to call 0. Minimum raise 60. We have 154 chips. So we could check or raise. Need to consider opponent tendencies. We have no data on DeepSeek's raise patterns on flop (they raised after a bet). Actually they raised on flop after seat4 bet 30. So they are aggressive. On turn board is 5d added (makes board 3-4-5-6-5?). Actually board now 3h 6s 4s 5d (no pair). Turn card is 5d, so now board has a pair of 5s. We have 8s, still middle pair. Opponent might have 5x for trips, or a straight draw (2 or 7). They could have a hand like 7-8 for straight? Actually board 3-4-5-6, a 7 would give straight 3-4-5-6-7. So 7 is straight. Also a 2 gives 2-3-4-5-6 straight. So opponent could have 7x or 2x. Also could have 5x for trips. Also could have a set? No set possible because no pair on board earlier. Could have 6x for trips? Board has 6s, so if they have 6? Only one 6 on board, they could have 6? That would be two pair (6s and maybe something else). Actually board now 3,4,5,6,5. So they could have 5 for trips. Or 6 for two pair (6 with something else). Or 8 for two pair (8 with board? No 8 not on board). So likely they have a draw or a made hand.\n\nOur pocket 8s is not great.

Also straight possibilities: board is 3-4-5-6, missing 2 or 7 for straight. Our hand 8s? No 8 doesn't help. No flush (two spades, two diamonds, one heart). So our eights are just a pair, second pair to the board's pair? Actually board has pair of 4s, we have a pair of 8s, so we have two pair (8s and 4s). That's decent but board also has potential for straight draws that might have completed: if opponent had 2-7, they could have straight on river? Let's see: board after turn: 3h 6s 4s 5d (turn unknown? Actually board: 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d, so turn was 4d? Wait board shows 5 cards: 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So turn card is 5d? No order: flop: 3h 6s 4s. Turn: 5d. River: 4d. So river paired the board with another 4. So final board: 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So there are three 4s? Actually there are two 4s: 4s on flop, 4d on river. So pair of 4s. No three of a kind. So we have two pair: 8s and 4s.\n\nPotential opponent hands: Could have a straight: 2-7? Board after turn: 3-4-5-6. If opponent had 2-7, they'd have a straight on the turn (2-3-4-5-6) or (3-4-5-6-7) depending. After river, the 4d gives board a pair, but straight still exists if they have 2-7? Actually if they have 2-7, they have 2-3-4-5-6 (a 6-high straight) using 2 and board 3-4-5-6. That's still a straight; river 4d doesn't affect. Or 7-8? 7-8 would give 4-5-6-7-8 straight using 7 and 8? But we have 8s but opponent could have 7-? Actually board has 3,4,5,6,4. For a straight, need 2-6 or 3-7. 7-8 would need 4-5-6-7-8, but board only has 4-5-6, missing 7. So need 7 in hand and 8? Wait 8 is not on board. So 7-8 would give 4-5-6-7-8 using 7 and 8, but board has 4-5-6, yes that makes straight 4-5-6-7-8. So opponent could have 7-8 (any suits). That would be a straight, beating our two pair. Also opponent could have 2-? 2-? Actually 2-? with 2 and something else? For straight 2-3-4-5-6 need 2 and something else (like 2 and any other). So 2-? any card not making higher straight. So opponent could have 2-? (like 2-9) and have straight 2-3-4-5-6.\n\nAlso they could have a full house? Board has pair of 4s. If opponent holds a 4, they'd have trips (three 4s) or full house if they also have a pair in hand? Not possible. They could have 4x making three of a kind (4s). That's better than two pair.\n\nCould have a set of 3s? No board only one 3. So set not possible.\n\nCould have a flush? No three of same suit.\n\nSo opponent's range: They raised preflop from BB (Seat 3) to 20, called by others, then on flop they checked, then bet 30 (Seat 4?

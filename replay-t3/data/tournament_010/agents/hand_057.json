They've been folding most hands and only occasionally raising.\n\n**Decision:**\nWith 6\u26668\u2663 in SB facing a raise from a tight player, this is an easy fold. The hand has very little potential, I'm out of position, and the opponent's range is likely strong. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

However, I'm getting decent pot odds: need to call 12 to win 32, which is 2.67:1 odds (27% equity needed).\n\nBut there are tournament considerations:\n- I have a healthy stack (42.8 BB)\n- Opponent has 174 chips (21.75 BB)\n- I'm out of position (BB vs CO)\n- 87o doesn't play well out of position\n\nLooking at my recent hands, I've been playing fairly tight, folding marginal hands preflop. This is a borderline spot. The opponent's raise sizing (2.5x) is standard, and given their fold-heavy tendency, they might have a decent but not premium hand.\n\nGiven that I'm out of position with a weak hand, and the opponent has shown some aggression (one previous raise), I think folding is correct here. The pot odds are tempting, but playing 87o out of position against a likely decent range is not optimal.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.",

While TKs is playable in many situations, being first to act from UTG with this hand puts me at a significant disadvantage. I should wait for a stronger hand or better position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Folding Td Ks from UTG position against a tight opponent.

I need to analyze this situation carefully.\n\nMy hand is Td Ks - that's a decent hand but not premium. From UTG position, this is a relatively strong hand but I need to consider the position and the action.\n\nLooking at the opponent information I just retrieved for Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking):\n- They've been quite passive, folding a lot preflop (folds in hands 53, 54, 55)\n- When they do play, they tend to check a lot preflop\n- In hand 56, they checked preflop, then bet 16 chips on the flop, then checked the rest of the way\n- From their showdown history, they seem to play relatively tight ranges\n\nThe current situation:\n- I'm UTG with Td Ks\n- There's 12 chips in the pot (small blind 4 + big blind 8)\n- I need to call 8 chips to see the flop\n- Minimum raise would be to 16 chips total\n\nConsiderations:\n1. Position: UTG is the worst position in poker. I have to act first postflop.\n2. Hand strength: TKs is decent but not premium. It's a connector with straight potential but no flush potential (Td and Ks are different suits).\n3. Stack size: 26.2 BB is a medium stack. I'm not short stacked but also not deep.\n4. Opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 seems tight and passive.\n\nFrom UTG with TKs, I should generally be cautious. While it's a playable hand, the position disadvantage is significant. I could:\n1. Fold - This might be the safest play given the position\n2. Call - See a cheap flop and evaluate\n3. Raise - This would be quite aggressive from UTG with this hand\n\nGiven that I'm UTG with a marginal hand and facing a tight opponent, folding seems like the most prudent decision. \n\nThe marginal nature of TKs, combined with the challenging UTG position, suggests a conservative approach. With Kimi-K2's tight playing style, continuing with this hand could lead to difficult postflop decisions. The risk of being out of position with a hand that doesn't have strong drawing potential makes folding the most logical choice.\n",

Actually raise to 6 means they raised to 6 total? Hard to interpret. But they raise varied, sometimes larger. BB (seat3) raises amounts: 64,20,24,24,20. So BB is also raising, sometimes big (64). Both seem aggressive.\n\nWe are on BTN, 9dJd suited. With 24 BB stack, we can open raise to at least 16 (minimum raise). Usually standard open raise is 2.5-3x BB = 20-24. Given our stack and hand, 9dJd suited is a decent opening hand from BTN. Considering aggressive opponents, we could raise to 20-24 to isolate. Minimum raise is 16, but raising to 20 is reasonable. Should we consider calling? No, we are not facing a bet; we must act. Options: fold, call (call 8 i.e., just limping), raise. Limping with 9dJd is not ideal; better to raise. So we raise.\n\nPick raise_to: maybe 20 (total). That's 2.5 BB (8*2.5=20). That's above min. So action raise to 20.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

            "reasoning_content": "  This is a tournament setting where I have 184.5 BB (big blinds). I'm on the Button with K\u26653\u2666. Let me analyze:\n\n**Hand Strength**: K\u26653\u2666 is a very weak hand. It's offsuit with a weak kicker. The only redeeming quality is the King, but the 3 kicker makes it very vulnerable.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button, which is the best position post-flop. However, I only have one opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2 in the BB).\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**: Looking at the data from recall_opponent_actions:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 has been quite active preflop with raises (hands 11, 13)\n- But has also folded several times recently (hands 12, 14, 15, 16)\n- In hand 13, they raised preflop to 10, then called a re-raise to 20, but folded on the flop\n- They seem to be a thinking player who can fold\n\n**Pot Odds**: The pot is 3 chips, I need to call 1 chip to see the flop. That's 3:1 pot odds. This is good, but my hand is very weak.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: I have a healthy stack of 184.5 BB. I don't need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands. The BB is 2 chips, so calling 1 chip is only 0.5 BB.\n\n**Decision**: While the pot odds are decent (3:1) and I'm in position, K3o is just too weak. Even if I hit a King on the flop, I'll be dominated by any better King. If I hit the 3, I'll have a weak pair. The only good scenario is hitting two pair or trips, which is unlikely (about 2.6% chance).\n\nGiven that this is a tournament and I have a healthy stack, I should preserve my chips and wait for better spots. The opponent in BB seems capable and could easily have me dominated or have a strong hand.\n\nI should **fold**.\n\nLet me double-check: I'm on the Button, it's only 1 chip to call (0.5 BB), pot is 3 chips (1.5 BB), giving me 3:1 pot odds. But with K3o, even in position, this is a clear fold in a tournament setting with a healthy stack.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent tendencies:\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (SB):**\n- Very tight preflop, folding most hands (hands 63, 64, 65, 68)\n- When they do play, they just call rather than raise (hands 66, 67)\n- In hand 66, they called preflop, then checked all streets (very passive)\n- In hand 67, they called preflop and made a small flop bet\n- Overall: Very tight-passive player\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B (BB):**\n- Mixed patterns: folds, calls, and raises\n- Made a big raise to 174 chips in hand 65 (likely a strong hand)\n- Made a smaller raise to 48 chips in hand 68\n- In hand 66, checked through to showdown\n- Overall: More aggressive than MiniMax, capable of making raises\n\n**My situation:**\n- Cards: 8\u2660 9\u2660 - suited connectors, decent speculative hand\n- Position: Button (best position)\n- Stack: 412 chips (25.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 8/16, need to call 16 to see flop\n- Pot odds: 24:16 or 1.5:1 (need ~40% equity to call)\n\nWith 8\u2660 9\u2660 on the button facing a tight-passive SB and a moderately aggressive BB, this is a good spot to try to steal the blinds or see a cheap flop with a speculative hand. \n\nGiven my position and the fact that both opponents have shown they can fold, a raise makes sense here. A standard raise would be to about 3x the BB = 48 chips. This puts pressure on both opponents and gives me initiative.\n\nIf I just call, I'm giving the BB a free chance to see the flop and I'm out of position postflop (though I'm on the button, so I have position). Actually wait - I'm ON the button, so I have position on everyone postflop. So calling is also reasonable to see a cheap flop with a speculative hand.\n\nLet me think about stack sizes:\n- MiniMax-M2 has 222 chips (13.9 BB) - getting short\n\n\n- GPT-OSS-120B has 300 chips (18.8 BB) - medium stack\n- I have 412 chips (25.8 BB) - big stack\n\nThe table dynamics suggest an opportunity for strategic aggression. MiniMax-M2's tight-passive nature means they'll likely fold to pressure, while GPT-OSS-120B's moderate aggression could be neutralized with a well-timed raise. My suited connectors and chip advantage create an ideal scenario for a steal attempt. A 3x BB raise to 48 chips could effectively pressure both opponents and potentially win the blinds without a fight.\n\nThe button position further enhances my strategic options, allowing me to control the pot's tempo and potentially extract value if I connect with the board. With both opponents showing tendencies to fold under pressure, this looks like a prime spot for a calculated aggressive move.",

However, Js 5c simply doesn't have enough equity to justify calling, especially when I'm out of position.\n\nWith 222 chips (13.9 BB), I should be selective and wait for a better spot rather than chasing with this weak hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Js 5c is too weak to call a 40-chip raise.

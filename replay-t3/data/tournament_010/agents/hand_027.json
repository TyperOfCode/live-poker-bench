Opponents have similar stacks (253 and 252 chips).\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown aggressive preflop tendencies, raising to 8 chips in hands 23, 24, and 25. In hand 25, they called a re-raise to 16. They seem somewhat loose-aggressive.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded preflop (hands 21-24, 26), but made a big raise to 24 in hand 25. They showed Ad Ts in hand 25, so they can play speculative hands.\n\n5. **Current situation**: I'm on the button with 4 chips to call. There's 6 chips in the pot (SB + BB). Seat 1 folded, so it's just me to act against SB (Seat 4) and BB (Seat 5).\n\nWith pocket aces, I definitely want to build the pot. The standard play would be to raise. Since I'm on the button and both blinds are still in, I should make a substantial raise to isolate and build the pot.\n\nLooking at the minimum raise to: 8, which is just a min-raise. That's probably too small. I should raise to something like 12-16 chips to build a pot and discourage speculative calls.\n\nGiven that Seat 4 has been raising to 8 preflop, and Seat 5 raised to 24 in one hand, I think a raise to 16-20 would be appropriate. This builds the pot while still allowing me to potentially get action.\n\nI'll raise to 16 chips (4x the BB). This is a strong but not overly aggressive raise that should get respect and potentially get calls from the blinds.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 16,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket aces on the button - premium hand that should be raised aggressively.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI have Ad Ah (pocket aces) on the BTN with 191 chips (47.8 BB). I raised to 16 (4x BB). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) in the SB 3-bet to 28 total (7x BB). BB folded.\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: I see from hand #21 they raised to 8, then re-raised to 48 (a massive 4-bet). From hands #23-25, they raised to 8 (standard 2x BB raise) multiple times. In hand #25, they called a 3-bet with Jh Kh.\n\nNow I need to decide: fold, call 12 more, or raise. With pocket aces, I should definitely not fold. Calling is an option, but raising is better to build the pot and get value. The pot is currently 48 (my 16 + their 28 + blinds 4). I need to call 12 more to make it 40 total.\n\nIf I raise, minimum raise to 40 total. That would be raising 24 more (from my current 16 to 40). Or I could raise more.\n\nMy stack is 191, opponent has 227. This is a tournament situation. With pocket aces, I want to get as many chips in preflop as possible. The opponent has shown aggression with re-raises (hand #21 they 4-bet to 48). They might have a strong hand but not necessarily as strong as AA.\n\nI should 4-bet. Let me calculate: if I raise to say 60-80, that would be a significant portion of my stack. Actually, let me think: minimum raise to 40 is small - only 24 more from my 16. That seems too small. I could raise to 80-100, which would be committing a good portion of my stack.\n\nGiven tournament dynamics and my premium hand, I should make a substantial 4-bet. Let's say raise to 80 total (putting in 64 more). That's a 4-bet to 20x BB. If they 5-bet shove, I'm calling with AA.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: I have 191, opponent has 227. If I raise to 80, I'd have 111 left behind. The pot would be 80 + 28 + 4 = 112. So I'd have roughly pot-sized bet left. That sets up a potential shove on flop.\n\nBetter to raise larger to commit more chips preflop. Maybe raise to 100? That would leave me 91 behind. Actually, with AA, I could even consider shoving all-in preflop given stack sizes (191 total, 47.8 BB). But that might scare them off.\n\nLet me check if they've shown willingness to call big bets preflop. In hand #21, they 4-bet to 48 (12x BB). In hand #25, they called a 3-bet with Jh Kh.\n\nI think a raise to 80-100 is good. Let's go with 100 total (raising 84 more from my current 16). That's a strong 4-bet.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 100,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket aces premium hand. Opponent has shown aggression with re-raises (hand #21 4-bet to 48).

They have good value preflop and can win big pots.\n\n**Position**: While in the Small Blind isn't ideal, pocket pairs are strong enough to play from any position.\n\n**Stack Considerations**: With 253 chips (63.2 BB), I have a healthy stack that allows me to play aggressively and build my chip count.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: DeepSeek-V3.2 has raised to 16 chips. Looking at their recent history, they tend to fold frequently (7 folds in last 10 hands) but do raise occasionally. This suggests they might be playing tight overall.\n\n**Pot Odds**: The pot is 22 chips and I need to call 14 more, giving me pot odds of about 1.57:1.\n\n**Optimal Action**: I should 3-bet here to:\n1. Build the pot with a strong hand\n2. Get value from worse hands that might call\n3. Maintain an aggressive image\n4. Put pressure on a tight opponent\n\nThe minimum raise to is 28 chips, which is reasonable given my stack size and the strength of my hand. This is the clear value play with pocket nines.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 28,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket nines are a strong hand that should be 3-bet for value.

Pocket pairs are valuable because they can make sets, full houses, and quads, and they're disguised hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the Small Blind (SB) position, which is not ideal for playing marginal hands, but pocket nines are strong enough to play from any position.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 253 chips (63.2 BB), which is a healthy stack. I should be playing aggressively with strong hands to build my stack.\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis**: \n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 has raised to 16 chips preflop\n   - Looking at their recent history, they seem to fold a lot (7 folds in last 10 hands) but do raise occasionally (2 raises in last 10 hands)\n   - This suggests they might be playing tight/passive overall\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: The current pot is 22 chips, and I need to call 14 more to see the flop. This gives me pot odds of about 1.57:1, which is reasonable for a strong hand like pocket nines.\n\n6. **Action Options**:\n   - **Fold**: Too weak with pocket nines\n   - **Call**: Could be okay, but I'm missing value by not raising\n   - **Raise**: This is the best option. I should 3-bet with pocket nines to:\n     - Build the pot with a strong hand\n     - Get value from worse hands\n     - Maintain my image as an aggressive player\n     - Put pressure on opponents\n\n7. **Raise Size**: The minimum raise to is 28 chips total. Given my stack size and the strength of my hand, this seems reasonable.\n\n8. **Tournament Considerations**: I'm at 63.2 BB, so I have room to play aggressively. Building my stack with strong hands is important for tournament survival.\n \nI'm confident a strategic 3-bet will maximize my chip potential and exploit the opponent's tight tendencies. The 28-chip raise puts significant pressure on DeepSeek-V3.2 while allowing me to control the hand's direction.",

This 3-bet to 100 chips (nearly his entire stack of 107) suggests a very strong hand or a shove attempt.\n\n**Mathematical Considerations:**\n- To call 72 chips into a pot that would be 204, I need ~26% equity\n- Against a typical 3-betting range (JJ+, AK), pocket nines have approximately 20-25% equity\n- The minimum raise to 172 would put me all-in for 227 chips total\n\n**Stack Dynamics:**\n- I have 56.8 BB vs opponent's 26.8 BB\n- This size 3-bet (to 100) often indicates either AA/KK/AK or a shove attempt\n- Calling leaves me with ~155 chips behind, creating awkward postflop decisions\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. The opponent's 3-bet sizing and stack size suggest they either have a premium hand or are making a move with a short stack. Pocket nines, while playable, don't have sufficient equity against a likely strong 3-betting range in this spot.\n\nThe mathematical expectation is negative, and folding preserves my healthy stack for better opportunities.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Facing a large 3-bet to 100 from a short-stacked opponent, pocket nines lack sufficient equity against a likely strong 3-betting range.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in the BB with pocket nines (9s 9d) \n- Stack: 227 chips (56.8 BB)\n- Opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) has 107 chips\n- Current pot: 132 chips\n- Action: DeepSeek 3-bet to 100, I need to call 72 more (minimum raise to 172)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Opponent Tendencies**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's recent preflop actions, I see:\n   - He's been quite active with raises (hand #13: raise 10, hand #19: raise 8, hand #22: raise 12)\n   - But he's also been folding a lot (lots of folds in the recent hands)\n   - This 3-bet to 100 is quite large relative to his stack (107 chips total)\n\n2. **My Hand Strength**: \n   - Pocket nines are a decent hand but vulnerable to overpairs\n   - Against a 3-betting range, nines are likely behind most of the time\n   - However, I have position and could potentially get value from worse hands\n\n3. **Stack Considerations**:\n   - I have 227 chips vs opponent's 107 chips\n   - This is a significant stack difference\n   - If I call, I'd have about 155 chips left (227 - 72 = 155)\n   - If I raise all-in to 172, I'd be committing most of my stack\n\n4. **Pot Odds**:\n   - To call 72 into a pot that would become 204 (132 + 72), I need about 26% equity\n   - Against a typical 3-betting range (JJ+, AK, maybe some suited connectors), pocket nines might have around 20-25% equity\n   \n5. **Tournament Considerations**:\n   - I'm at 56.8 BB, so I have a healthy stack\n   - I should be selective about getting involved in marginal spots\n   - The opponent's stack size (107 chips) suggests they might be looking for spots to double up\n   \nI'm leaning towards a conservative approach. The opponent's 3-bet range seems strong, and my pocket nines face significant challenges. With limited equity and potential for being dominated, the most prudent action appears to be folding. The math and game theory suggest avoiding this marginal situation, especially given the stack dynamics and the opponent's likely strong range.\n\nThe key considerations point to a clear decision: the 3-bet size and the opponent's stack size indicate a potentially dangerous scenario. My pocket nines, while not terrible, don't provide enough equity to justify calling or raising. Folding seems the most rational choice to protect my chip stack and avoid unnecessary risk.",

So we face 24 to call (since 28 total, we already posted 4). Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise total to at least 40). Need to decide.\n\nOur hand 8c Jc suited, not premium.

Past actions: raise 8 preflop several times (hands 23-25). So MiniMax-M2 tends to raise small preflop (8). In this hand they raised to 28 (3-bet). Could be 3-betting with a range of strong hands, maybe also some bluffs. Seat3 (DeepSeek) raised to 16, likely a standard opening. Could be wide.\n\nOur hand Jc8c: suited connectors, decent equity against a wide range but not great vs 3-bet. In BB with 63BB, we could consider 4-betting as a bluff (suit connectors) if we think seat4 can fold. But 8c Jc is not a strong 4-bet bluff; typical 4-bet bluff range includes AK, AQ, maybe A5s, KQs, etc. J8 suited is marginal. Also we are out of position. Likely best to fold.\n\nCheck if any reason to call: pot odds: pot 48 + 24 call = 72. Need to call 24 to win 72 (33% equity). Jc8c vs 3-bet range maybe 20% equity, not enough. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold."

            "reasoning_content": "We have hand: BB with 8c Jc. Opponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised to 16 (from UTG? seat3). Then seat4 (MiniMax-M2) re-raised to 28 (so 12 more). So we face 24 to call (since 28 total, we already posted 4). Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise total to at least 40). Need to decide.\n\nOur hand 8c Jc suited, not premium. Against a raise from seat3 and a 3-bet from seat4. Position: BB, out of position post-flop. Stack 252, still decent depth. Opponents: seat4 appears to be relatively aggressive? Past actions: raise 8 preflop several times (hands 23-25). So MiniMax-M2 tends to raise small preflop (8). In this hand they raised to 28 (3-bet). Could be 3-betting with a range of strong hands, maybe also some bluffs. Seat3 (DeepSeek) raised to 16, likely a standard opening. Could be wide.\n\nOur hand Jc8c: suited connectors, decent equity against a wide range but not great vs 3-bet. In BB with 63BB, we could consider 4-betting as a bluff (suit connectors) if we think seat4 can fold. But 8c Jc is not a strong 4-bet bluff; typical 4-bet bluff range includes AK, AQ, maybe A5s, KQs, etc. J8 suited is marginal. Also we are out of position. Likely best to fold.\n\nCheck if any reason to call: pot odds: pot 48 + 24 call = 72. Need to call 24 to win 72 (33% equity). Jc8c vs 3-bet range maybe 20% equity, not enough. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

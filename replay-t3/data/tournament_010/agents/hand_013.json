            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Position: SB (worst position postflop)\n- Cards: 8h 5d (very weak, offsuit, no straight potential, no flush potential)\n- Stack: 369 chips (184.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot: 7 chips\n- Action: BB posted, two players called (MiniMax-M2 and GPT-OSS-120B)\n- I need to call 1 chip to see the flop\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- MiniMax-M2: Has been fairly tight - folded many hands, raised once in hand 8, called flop bet in hand 10 then folded turn. Seems selective.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Very tight! Folded 9 out of 10 hands shown, only called once in hand 4 then folded preflop. This player is extremely tight.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 85o is one of the worst hands in poker. No suitedness, no connectivity, low cards.\n2. **Position**: SB is terrible position - I'll be first to act on every street.\n3. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 1 chip to win 7 chips (7:1 odds). This is attractive odds.\n4. **Implied Odds**: Very low with this hand. Even if I hit an 8 or 5, I'm likely dominated.\n5. **Opponents**: Two players called, including GPT-OSS-120B who is extremely tight. This suggests they have real hands.\n6. **Tournament**: I have a healthy stack. No need to gamble with marginal hands.\n\n**Conclusion**: Despite the good pot odds (7:1), this hand is simply too weak to play from the worst position against two players, especially when one opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) is extremely tight and likely has a strong hand. The risk of losing more chips postflop when I'm out of position with a weak hand outweighs the 1 chip investment. I should fold and wait for a better spot.",

I have pocket tens, a strong hand. I should consider raising for value. My stack is 242 chips (121 BB). Opponents have 188 chips each (94 BB). I'm in the BB, so I have position disadvantage postflop.

Let me use the recall tools quickly. But I need to respond in JSON. I'll make a decision based on general strategy: with pocket tens in the BB after two limpers, I should raise for value. Standard raise size would be 3-4x the big blind plus one per limper. So 3-4 BB + 2 = 5-6 BB total. Minimum raise to is 4 (2 BB). I could raise to 8-10 (4-5 BB). My stack is deep (121 BB), so I can raise a standard size. I'll raise to 10 chips (5 BB). That's a raise of 8 more (since I already have 2 in). Let me check if that's allowed: legal actions include raise. Yes. I'll go with that. But first, let me quickly check opponent tendencies. I'll use recall_opponent_actions for both opponents.",

This is their first aggressive action (raise to 30). This suggests they have a strong hand given their tight folding pattern.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has raised preflop twice before (both small raises to 4), and called my raise.\n\nMy hand: Pocket Tens is a strong hand, but vulnerable to overcards. With a 3-bet from a previously tight player (GPT-OSS-120B), I need to be cautious. The pot is 51 chips, and I need to call 20 more. That's pot odds of 20 to win 71 (51+20), or about 3.55:1, which is good.\n\nHowever, I'm out of position (SB), and there's still Seat 4 to act after me. If I call, Seat 4 might come along or re-raise.\n\nStack sizes: I have 234 total. I've already put in 12 chips (2 BB + 10 raise). Calling 20 more would put 32 total, leaving 202 behind. Raising to 50 would put 50 total, leaving 184 behind.\n\nGiven GPT-OSS-120B's tight folding history, their 3-bet likely represents a strong range: JJ+, AK, maybe AQs. My Tens are behind QQ+, tied with JJ, ahead of TT (same), and ahead of AK/AQ.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (117 BB). Folding preserves my stack. Calling keeps the pot manageable but puts me out of position. Raising commits more chips and could lead to a 4-bet or all-in from the tight player.\n\nGiven the tight player's first aggressive move, I should be cautious. However, pocket Tens is a strong hand, and the pot odds are good. I think calling is reasonable to see a flop and reassess. If I hit a set (22% chance), I can stack them. If the flop comes with overcards, I can proceed cautiously.\n\nActually, let me check if there's any more history on these opponents. Let me search for showdowns."

This is their first aggressive action (raise to 30). This suggests they have a strong hand given their tight folding pattern.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has raised preflop twice before (both small raises to 4), and called my raise.\n\nMy hand: Pocket Tens is a strong hand, but vulnerable to overcards. With a 3-bet from a previously tight player (GPT-OSS-120B), I need to be cautious. The pot is 51 chips, and I need to call 20 more. That's pot odds of 20 to win 71 (51+20), or about 3.55:1, which is good.\n\nHowever, I'm out of position (SB), and there's still Seat 4 to act after me. If I call, Seat 4 might come along or re-raise.\n\nStack sizes: I have 234 total. I've already put in 12 chips (2 BB + 10 raise). Calling 20 more would put 32 total, leaving 202 behind. Raising to 50 would put 50 total, leaving 184 behind.\n\nGiven GPT-OSS-120B's tight folding history, their 3-bet likely represents a strong range: JJ+, AK, maybe AQs. My Tens are behind QQ+, tied with JJ, ahead of TT (same), and ahead of AK/AQ.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (117 BB). Folding preserves my stack. Calling keeps the pot manageable but puts me out of position. Raising commits more chips and could lead to a 4-bet or all-in from the tight player.\n\nGiven the tight player's first aggressive move, I should be cautious. However, pocket Tens is a strong hand, and the pot odds are good. I think calling is reasonable to see a flop and reassess. If I hit a set (22% chance), I can stack them. If the flop comes with overcards, I can proceed cautiously.\n\nActually, let me check if there's any more history on these opponents. Let me search for showdowns.",

Preflop action: SB posted 1, I posted BB 2, then two callers, SB folded, I raised to 10, one caller, then Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 30, I called 20, other caller folded. So heads-up with Seat 5 going to flop.\n\nFlop: As Jh 7c. I have middle pair with tens, but there's an Ace on board. Seat 5 raised preflop, so their range likely includes strong hands: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe AJ, maybe some suited connectors. They could have Ace-x, maybe AJ, AQ, AK, maybe AA, JJ. I have to consider their raise size: they made it 30 total after my raise to 10. That's a 3x raise from my raise. That's a pretty strong raise.\n\nNow flop: Ace high board. This is bad for my tens. If they have an Ace, I'm crushed. If they have JJ, I'm crushed. If they have KK or QQ, they might continue. But they raised preflop, so they could have AK, AQ, AJ, maybe ATs. I'm behind most of their range.\n\nPot is 71 chips. My stack is 214. Amount to call is 0, so I can check. I can also raise. But raising seems dangerous. If I check, they might bet. If they bet, I have to decide whether to call. I have backdoor straight draw (if a Q and K come maybe? Actually T on board, need 9 and 8 for straight? Not really). I have a pair of tens, but likely behind.\n\nI should recall opponent tendencies. Let me use tools to see past actions by Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). Also maybe search for their behavior.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have Tc Td (pocket tens) on a board of As Jh 7c. This is a tough flop with an Ace on board. My tens are now essentially a bluff catcher at best. The only hands I'm beating are smaller pairs (99, 88, etc.) and maybe some draws.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, out of position against seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) who is the only other player in the hand.\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at the recall data, seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been very tight - folding preflop in 11 out of 12 hands, and only seeing a flop once in hand 3 where they had 8h2h and checked all streets. In hand 4, they called 1 chip (likely the SB) then folded to a raise. This suggests they're playing very conservatively.\n\n4. **Action this hand**: Preflop, seat 4 called, seat 5 called, I raised to 10 from BB, seat 4 called, then seat 5 raised to 30, I called 20 more, seat 4 folded. So seat 5's 3-bet to 30 is significant - they put in 30 total when facing my 10 raise. With their tight tendencies, this 3-bet likely represents a strong hand.\n\n5. **Board texture**: As Jh 7c - Ace high, rainbow likely (no flush draws). This hits a lot of strong hands that seat 5 could have 3-bet with: AA, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe AJ.\n\n6. **Stack sizes**: I have 214 chips, seat 5 has 160 chips. Pot is 71 chips.\n\n7. **Current action**: It's the flop, amount to call is 0, I can check or raise. Given the Ace on board and seat 5's tight 3-betting range, checking seems prudent.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: I have 214 chips (107 BB), which is a decent stack. No need to get involved in a marginal spot against what appears to be a strong hand.\n\nGiven seat 5's tight tendencies and their preflop 3-bet, they likely have a strong hand that connects well with this A-high board. My pocket tens are in bad shape against their range (AA, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe AJ). Even if they have QQ or KK, I'm still behind. Best case is they have a smaller pair like 99 or 88, but that seems unlikely given their 3-bet.\n\nI should check and see what they do. If they bet small, I might consider calling to see a turn, but if they bet big, I should likely fold. For now, check and evaluate.",

Opponent GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop (9 of 10 hands). This is their first significant action.\n2. Preflop action: I raised from BB to 10, then opponent 3-bet to 30. I called. This suggests opponent has a strong hand.\n3. The flop is As Jh 7c - Ace high board. This is a terrible flop for my pocket tens. The Ace is a major concern.\n4. Opponent now bets 80 chips (their entire remaining stack). This is a pot-sized bet.\n5. I have 214 chips total. If I call 80, I'll have 134 left. The pot will be 311 chips.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- My pocket tens are likely behind. An Ace on the flop means any Ace-x hand beats me.\n- Opponent's preflop 3-bet range likely includes: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe AJs, TT, 99.\n- Given the Ace on board, they could have: AK, AQ, AJ, AT, maybe AA (though less likely with one Ace on board).\n- They could also have an overpair like KK, QQ that's now scared of the Ace.\n- They could have JJ for a set.\n- They could have a big draw like KQs with backdoor flush potential.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Need to call 80 to win 311 (151 current pot + 80 opponent bet + my 80 call)\n- Pot odds: 80/(311) = 25.7%\n- I need ~26% equity to call.\n\n**Equity considerations:**\nAgainst a tight range of:\n- AK, AQ, AJ, AT, AA, KK, QQ, JJ\nMy equity is likely low. Against just AK, I have ~10% equity. Against a wider range including some bluffs, maybe 20-30%.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 107 BBs, which is a healthy stack.\n- Opponent has only 40 BBs (80 chips).\n- Folding leaves me with 214 chips (107 BBs).\n- Calling and losing leaves me with 134 chips (67 BBs) - still playable.\n- If I win, I'll have 294 chips (147 BBs).\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- They've been folding a lot, so when they do play, they likely have a strong hand.\n- The all-in bet on the flop after 3-betting preflop suggests real strength.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a tough spot. The Ace on board is terrible for my tens. While the pot odds are tempting (25.7%), I don't think I have enough equity against their likely range. The opponent has shown strength preflop and now is committing their entire stack. This looks like they have at least an Ace, possibly AK, AQ, or AJ. They could also have an overpair like KK or QQ, but even those have me crushed.\n\nGiven that:\n1. Board has an Ace\n2. Opponent 3-bet preflop\n3. Opponent is shoving all-in on flop\n4. I have middle pair with poor kicker\n5. I have a healthy stack to preserve\n\nI should fold. The risk/reward isn't favorable.\n\nHowever, let me consider if there's any chance they're bluffing. Given their tight folding history, this seems unlikely. They've waited for a hand and are now playing it aggressively.\n\nI'll fold."

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand: Tc Td (pocket tens)**\n**Board: As Jh 7c**\n**Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) with 80 chips total**\n**Pot: 151 chips**\n**Amount to call: 80 chips**\n**My stack: 214 chips**\n\nKey observations:\n1. Opponent GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop (9 of 10 hands). This is their first significant action.\n2. Preflop action: I raised from BB to 10, then opponent 3-bet to 30. I called. This suggests opponent has a strong hand.\n3. The flop is As Jh 7c - Ace high board. This is a terrible flop for my pocket tens. The Ace is a major concern.\n4. Opponent now bets 80 chips (their entire remaining stack). This is a pot-sized bet.\n5. I have 214 chips total. If I call 80, I'll have 134 left. The pot will be 311 chips.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- My pocket tens are likely behind. An Ace on the flop means any Ace-x hand beats me.\n- Opponent's preflop 3-bet range likely includes: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe AJs, TT, 99.\n- Given the Ace on board, they could have: AK, AQ, AJ, AT, maybe AA (though less likely with one Ace on board).\n- They could also have an overpair like KK, QQ that's now scared of the Ace.\n- They could have JJ for a set.\n- They could have a big draw like KQs with backdoor flush potential.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Need to call 80 to win 311 (151 current pot + 80 opponent bet + my 80 call)\n- Pot odds: 80/(311) = 25.7%\n- I need ~26% equity to call.\n\n**Equity considerations:**\nAgainst a tight range of:\n- AK, AQ, AJ, AT, AA, KK, QQ, JJ\nMy equity is likely low. Against just AK, I have ~10% equity. Against a wider range including some bluffs, maybe 20-30%.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 107 BBs, which is a healthy stack.\n- Opponent has only 40 BBs (80 chips).\n- Folding leaves me with 214 chips (107 BBs).\n- Calling and losing leaves me with 134 chips (67 BBs) - still playable.\n- If I win, I'll have 294 chips (147 BBs).\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- They've been folding a lot, so when they do play, they likely have a strong hand.\n- The all-in bet on the flop after 3-betting preflop suggests real strength.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a tough spot. The Ace on board is terrible for my tens. While the pot odds are tempting (25.7%), I don't think I have enough equity against their likely range. The opponent has shown strength preflop and now is committing their entire stack. This looks like they have at least an Ace, possibly AK, AQ, or AJ. They could also have an overpair like KK or QQ, but even those have me crushed.\n\nGiven that:\n1. Board has an Ace\n2. Opponent 3-bet preflop\n3. Opponent is shoving all-in on flop\n4. I have middle pair with poor kicker\n5. I have a healthy stack to preserve\n\nI should fold. The risk/reward isn't favorable.\n\nHowever, let me consider if there's any chance they're bluffing. Given their tight folding history, this seems unlikely. They've waited for a hand and are now playing it aggressively.\n\nI'll fold.",

Being out of position to potentially aggressive players\n2. Facing what appears to be strong action from tight opponents\n3. The risk of being committed with a marginal hand\n4.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Qc 9c - This is a suited connector, not a premium hand but has potential for straights, flushes, and pairs.\n\n2. **Current situation**: \n   - I'm in the BB with 180 chips (90 BB)\n   - Pot is 71 chips\n   - I need to call 20 more chips to continue\n   - The action has been: Seat 3 raised to 10, I called 8, Seat 5 raised to 30, Seat 3 called 20\n   - Now it's back to me with a call of 20\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**:\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Has been active with raises and calls, showed As 9h in one hand. Seems to be a thinking player who plays somewhat aggressively.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been folding a lot (9 out of 10 recent hands), showed 8h 2h in one hand. Seems very tight/passive.\n\n4. **Stack considerations**: \n   - My 180 chips puts me at 90 BB - healthy stack\n   - Seat 3 has 214 chips (107 BB)\n   - Seat 5 has 160 chips (80 BB)\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 20 into a pot that will be around 111 chips (71 current + 20 from me + 20 from the final caller). That's about 18% pot odds.\n\n6. **Hand strength**: Qc 9c is decent in multi-way pots, especially with two players who seem to have different styles. It has straight and flush potential.\n\nGiven that:\n- This is a relatively early hand (#13) in a tournament\n- I have a decent stack (90 BB)\n- The hand has decent potential \n- One opponent seems tight (Seat 5) and one seems more aggressive (Seat 3)\n- The pot odds are reasonable for a speculative hand\n \nI'll carefully consider the betting dynamics. The preflop action reveals interesting player tendencies. Seat 5's aggressive 3-bet to 30 suggests a strong hand, while Seat 3's call indicates they might have a moderate holding. My Qc 9c has potential, but the 20-chip call requires careful evaluation. The multi-way pot offers implied odds, yet I need to be cautious about overcommitting with a speculative hand.\n\nThe key factors are stack sizes, opponent ranges, and my position. With 90 big blinds, I have room to maneuver, but the 20-chip investment demands a strategic approach. I'll assess whether the potential reward justifies the current risk.\n\nThe tight player (Seat 5) and thinking player (Seat 3) suggest a nuanced betting landscape. My suited connector has potential, but requires careful evaluation of implied odds and stack depth.\n\nFolding seems prudent given the uncertain dynamics and my moderate hand strength. The risk outweighs the potential reward at this stage.",

J9 suited is a speculative hand. In a tournament with 95 BB stack, still deep enough. But there are 3 players already; raising may isolate, but also could get re-raised. Opponent tendencies unknown. Could check if we have option? No, must call or raise or fold. Usually with J9 suited on BTN, one may raise to steal blinds, but there is already a caller (MP). So raising could be okay to try to isolate and get heads-up with SB and BB maybe fold. But risk of 3-bet from BB? BB has 242 chips, might 3-bet with strong range. However J9 suited has some equity.

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: We are BTN with Jd9d. Board: As Jh 7c. So we have top pair (Jack) with a gutshot straight draw (10) and a backdoor flush draw (diamonds). Also we have a pair of Jacks, but opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) is the only remaining player (Seat 3). He checked to us on flop. Pot 71. He is in BB (seat3). Preflop action: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, Seat4 called 2, we called 2, then SB folded, BB raise 10, Seat4 call 8, we raise to 30, BB call 20. So preflop we raised and got called by BB, pot 71 includes blinds etc.\n\nNow flop: BB checked. We have top pair with decent kicker (9). Opponent's range likely includes Aces, Jacks, maybe 7x, maybe 8-9 combos, maybe straight draws, etc. He checked, maybe weak or trap. We can consider betting for value and protection. Our stack 160, we have 71 in pot, we have 130 remaining after our call? Actually we have 160 total, we have invested preflop: 2 (call) + 30 raise = 32? Actually we called 2, raised to 30 (so additional 28), total 30? Wait raise to 30 includes the 2 call? Preflop: we called 2, then raise to 30 (so we put total 30). So we have 160-30 =130 left. Pot 71 includes our 30, opponent's 20 call, plus others? Let's compute: SB 1, BB 2, Seat4 call 2, we call 2, then BB raise 10 (total 12?), Wait timeline: SB post 1, BB post 2, Seat4 call 2 (so puts 2), Seat5 call 2 (we call 2). SB fold. BB raise 10 (so adds 10 more, making his total 12). Seat4 call 8 (makes his total 10?). Actually seat4 had 2, call 8 = total 10. Then we raise to 30 (so we add 20 more beyond our 2). BB call 20 (makes his total 32). So pot after preflop: SB 1 (folded), BB 32, Seat4 10, us 30 = 73? plus maybe some? The pot listed as 71, close enough.\n\nNow flop: opponent checked, amount to call 0. Minimum raise 20. Legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nWe should consider betting. With top pair, decent kicker, we want value from weaker Jacks (like Jx) and maybe Ace. Also protect against draws. So raise is appropriate.\n\nSize: Pot 71, typical raise 2.5-3x pot for value. But we have 130 left, could raise to say 100 (total). Minimum raise is 20 (to 90? Wait raise_to is total amount we put in? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in, not additional. So if we raise to 90, we would be adding 90-30? Actually our current contribution to pot is 30 preflop, but on flop we haven't contributed yet. The raise_to amount is total amount we are putting in this street? Usually raise_to is total bet amount. So we need to set raise_to maybe 70 (i.e., bet 70). But the raise must be at least 20 (minimum raise to 20). The pot is 71, so a raise to 71+20=91? Actually minimum raise is current bet (0) + min raise amount (20) = 20. So we can bet any amount >=20. Usually we bet like 50-70.\n\nGiven stack 130, we could bet 80 (to 80). That would be about 1.1x pot. Could also bet 100 (1.4x pot). Considering opponent's range includes Aces, they may call with Ace high? Might fold. Might also have Jacks, they will call.\n\nWe also need tournament considerations: 80 BB stack, not huge but decent. We can afford a decent bet.\n\nThus I think raise to 80 (total bet 80). Reason: value and protection.\n\nCheck alternative: Could check and see turn. But opponent may give free card, dangerous for draws. So raise.\n\nThus answer: raise to 80.\n\n",

Actually we have Jd, board Jh, also have a diamond flush draw (two diamonds in hand, board has none). So we have pair of Jacks, plus an open-ended straight draw? Board: A J 7, we have 9, so possible straight draw 9-10-J-Q-K? Not open-ended. Only gutshot 10? Actually need 10 to make straight J-10-9-8-7? No we have 9, board 7, need 8 and 10 to make straight, not possible. So just pair and backdoor flush. Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) checked. Pot 71. We have 160 stack, 80 BB. Minimum raise is 20, to 20? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. The current bet is 0, so raise to at least 20 (i.e., 20 total). Could raise larger. Consider opponent's tendencies unknown. We have top pair, decent hand, can bet for value. Might raise to about half pot: pot 71, raise to 100? That's 100 total? Actually raise_to is total we put in, not additional. So if we raise to 100, we are adding 100 chips (since no bet). That's about 1.4x pot. Might be okay. Opponent's stack 214, could call. Might want to extract value but also protect against draws (A could be a higher pair? Actually opponent could have A? Board As, they could have A?? Actually As is on board, so opponent could have A with kicker. They could have A? But As is board, so they'd need another Ace for trips. Could have pocket Aces? That's unlikely. Could have set of 7? board 7c, could have 7x for set. So opponent could have set. But they checked. Checking with set is unlikely; they'd bet. So likely they have weak hand. So we can bet. Raise to 80 (like 80 total) is about pot+9. Reasonable. Let's output raise to 80. Ensure JSON format.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have BTN with 7d Qh, short stack 174 chips, blinds 32/64, effective stack 174, BB 64, SB 32. Pot 96 (SB+BB+? Actually SB posted 32, BB 64, plus maybe antes? pot 96). We are to act after SB posted 32 (small blind) and BB posted 64. Actually actions: Seat5 post_sb 32, Seat1 post_bb 64. So we are in BTN (but also SB?) Wait seat5 is BTN but also posted SB? Actually BTN is seat5 and also is small blind? Usually BTN is not SB. But here they posted SB 32, so seat5 is SB (maybe they are in SB position). The description says Position: BTN (Seat5). But they posted SB. Possibly they are both BTN and SB due to 2-player? Actually there are many folds, only seat1 BB and seat5 SB (BTN). So they are in the small blind, button is also SB because only two players left? In heads-up, SB is also button. So position is SB (also button). So we are first to act preflop after posting SB. The BB has posted 64, we face 32 to call (to match BB). Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., raise by 96? Actually raise total to 128). Our stack 174, so we can raise to 128 (leaving 46 behind). Or go all-in 174.\n\nHand 7d Qh is not great. With 2.7 BB short stack, need to shove or fold. In heads-up, 7Q offsuit is marginal. But given we are short, we could push all-in to try to steal BB. However we have 2.7 BB, which is borderline for a shove? Typically with <3 BB you push or fold, but with 7Q offsuit maybe push is okay? But we are out of position (SB vs BB). In heads-up, SB is first to act preflop, but after posting, we act first? Actually after posting SB, action goes to BB first preflop (in heads-up). In heads-up, the SB acts first preflop? Wait in heads-up, the dealer is also the small blind, and the big blind acts first preflop? Actually in heads-up, the dealer posts small blind and acts first preflop, then big blind acts second. But here they posted SB then BB, and now it's our turn? The actions list only posts, no further actions. So it's our turn to act? In heads-up, after blinds posted, the SB (dealer) acts first preflop. So we are to act now, facing BB's 64 already in pot, and we have to call 32 to see flop or raise.\n\nGiven 7Q offsuit, short stack, we could shove all-in (174) which is 2.7 BB. That's typical push/fold strategy. Is 7Q a push? According to typical push/fold charts for 2.7 BB in heads-up, you push with any Ace, any pair, broadways, maybe QJ, KQ, etc. 7Q is maybe marginal. Many charts include Q9+, J9+, T9+, 98s etc. 7Q is Q7 offsuit, not strong. Might be a fold. But also we could call 32 (just match BB) and hope to see flop. But with 2.7 BB, calling is not great because we would be out of position post-flop (BB will act first). And we have weak hand.\n\nThus likely fold. But we could consider raising to 128 (min raise) to try to steal. That's a raise, not all-in. But we have only 174 chips, raising to 128 leaves 46 behind, then BB could call or raise. Might be too much.\n\nGiven typical tournament, short stack push/fold: 7Q offsuit is probably a fold. So answer fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Everyone has folded to me, so it's just me vs the BB (Seat 4: MiniMax-M2). I posted the small blind of 1, and the BB posted 2. I need to call 1 more chip to see the flop, or I can raise or fold.\n\nMy hand: A9 offsuit. This is a decent hand to open from the button, especially with everyone folded to me. I have position advantage on the BB. The BB only has 198 chips, similar to my stack. \n\nI don't have much history on MiniMax-M2 - only one hand where they folded preflop from some position. Since I'm on the button with a decent hand, I should probably raise to put pressure on the BB. A standard button open raise would be 2.5-3x the BB, so 5-6 chips total. Since the minimum raise is to 4 chips (total), I could raise to 5 or 6.\n\nHowever, I also have to consider tournament strategy. With 98.5 BB, I'm deep stacked. A9o is not a premium hand, but it's playable from the button. Calling (completing) the small blind is also an option, but raising is generally better with position.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: I need to call 1 chip to win 3 chips in the pot (my 1 SB + BB's 2 BB). That's 3:1 pot odds, which is excellent. But raising is still better for initiative.\n\nI should raise to build the pot with position. Let me decide on a raise size. Minimum raise is to 4 total (2 more chips). But I'd prefer a standard 2.5x raise, which would be 5 total (3 more chips). Or 3x = 6 total. Since we're deep, I'll go with 5 total.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 5,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A9o is a decent button opening hand with everyone folded.

The board is 3c Ac Th - I have an Ace with a 9 kicker. This is a decent hand on the flop, but vulnerable to better Aces (AT, AJ, AQ, AK) or two pairs/sets. The 9 is not great kicker-wise.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is excellent. I acted last preflop and will act last postflop, giving me positional advantage.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the limited data, MiniMax-M2 folded Q5s in the BB in Hand #1 when facing action. In this hand, they called my preflop raise from the BB. Their calling range from BB could include many hands: suited connectors, small pairs, some Ax hands, broadways. They might be defending wide from BB.\n\n4. **Pot odds and implied odds**: Pot is 10 chips. If I bet, I can get value from weaker Aces, draws (gutshots, backdoor flush draws), and maybe some pocket pairs that will call. I should bet for value and protection.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 96.5 BB, a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks, but should build pots when I have an edge.\n\n**Decision**: I should bet/raise here. Checking gives a free card to potential draws (KQ, QJ, gutshots). My hand is vulnerable and I want to charge draws and get value from worse hands. A bet of 5-8 chips (half to 80% pot) seems reasonable. Since minimum raise is to 3 (which would be a bet of 1 chip more than checking), I should raise to a more meaningful amount.\n\nI'll raise to 8 chips total (betting 7 chips into 10 chip pot, about 70% pot). This gets value from draws and weaker hands while protecting my hand."

The board is 3c Ac Th - I have an Ace with a 9 kicker. This is a decent hand on the flop, but vulnerable to better Aces (AT, AJ, AQ, AK) or two pairs/sets. The 9 is not great kicker-wise.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is excellent. I acted last preflop and will act last postflop, giving me positional advantage.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the limited data, MiniMax-M2 folded Q5s in the BB in Hand #1 when facing action. In this hand, they called my preflop raise from the BB. Their calling range from BB could include many hands: suited connectors, small pairs, some Ax hands, broadways. They might be defending wide from BB.\n\n4. **Pot odds and implied odds**: Pot is 10 chips. If I bet, I can get value from weaker Aces, draws (gutshots, backdoor flush draws), and maybe some pocket pairs that will call. I should bet for value and protection.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 96.5 BB, a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks, but should build pots when I have an edge.\n\n**Decision**: I should bet/raise here. Checking gives a free card to potential draws (KQ, QJ, gutshots). My hand is vulnerable and I want to charge draws and get value from worse hands. A bet of 5-8 chips (half to 80% pot) seems reasonable. Since minimum raise is to 3 (which would be a bet of 1 chip more than checking), I should raise to a more meaningful amount.\n\nI'll raise to 8 chips total (betting 7 chips into 10 chip pot, about 70% pot). This gets value from draws and weaker hands while protecting my hand.",

Let me think about the situation again:\n\nI'm on the button with As9h, board is 3c Ac Th. I have top pair with 9 kicker. The pot is 10 chips. I have position. The BB called my preflop raise. Now on the flop, I can check or raise (bet). I should bet for value and protection. The minimum raise is to 3, which means I can bet 1 chip (since checking is 0, raising to 3 means putting in 3 total, which is a bet of 3). Actually wait: amount to call is 0, minimum raise to is 3. That means if I want to bet, I need to raise to at least 3 chips total. So a bet of 3 chips into 10 chip pot is about 30% pot. That's a bit small. I could bet more. Since I'm first to act (well, BB checked to me? Actually no, the action shows: amount to call is 0, so the BB must have checked. The action sequence shows preflop actions only. So on the flop, BB checked, and now it's my action with amount to call 0). So I can check or raise (bet). I should bet for value. A reasonable bet size is 5-8 chips. The minimum raise to is 3, so I can raise to any amount up to my stack. I'll raise to 8 chips total (betting 8 chips). That's a bet of 8 into 10 pot, about 80% pot.

I have three aces with 9 kicker. The board shows A-A-A-3-T-Q\n2. There's a possible straight: T-Q-K would make a straight, but board has A-A-A-3-T-Q, so straight would need K-J\n3. Opponent called my flop bet, then checked back turn\n4. I have no information about this opponent's tendencies (only 1 hand observed where they folded preflop)\n\n**Analysis:**\n- My hand is very strong - three aces with 9 kicker\n- However, the board is scary with three aces - opponent could have:\n  - A better kicker (AK, AQ, AJ, AT) - would beat my A9\n  - A full house (if they have pocket 3s or pocket Ts or pocket Qs)\n  - Quads (if they have pocket As, but that's unlikely)\n  - Straight (KJ would make a straight)\n- The pot is 26 chips, I can check or bet\n- If I bet, I could get value from worse hands like:\n  - Lower aces (A2-A8)\n  - Bluffs or weaker pairs that might call\n- But opponent's calling range on flop and checking turn suggests they might have:\n  - A weak ace\n  - A draw\n  - A medium pair\n\n**Decision:**\nI think a small value bet is reasonable here. The pot is 26 chips, I could bet around 12-15 chips (about half pot). This might get called by weaker aces or even some bluffs. If I get raised, I can fold since my kicker is weak.\n\nGiven the minimum raise is 8, I could bet 12-15 as a raise. Let's go with 14 chips (about half pot). This is a value bet targeting worse aces. If opponent has a better hand, they'll raise and I can fold.\n\nI'll check if I can bet 14. The minimum raise is 8, so I can raise to any amount from 8 up to my stack. I'll raise to 14."

Wait, let me calculate carefully.\n\n**Pot calculation:**\n- Preflop: I raised to 5, opponent called 3 more (pot was 5+3+blinds 3 = 11?)\n- Flop: I bet 8, opponent called 8 (pot 11+16=27)\n- Turn: Both checked (pot 27)\n- River: I bet 12, opponent raised 24 (making it 24 total)\n- Current pot before my call: 27 + 12 + 24 = 63? Actually opponent's raise to 24 means they put in 24 total, which is 12 more than my bet. So pot is 27 + 12 + 24 = 63. I need to call 12 more to win 63+12=75 total? Let me recalc:\n\nBetter: After my river bet of 12, pot was 27+12=39. Opponent raised to 24 total, putting in 12 more. So pot is now 39+12=51. I need to call 12 to win 51+12=63.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have trip aces with nine kicker. The board is 3c Ac Th Qd Ad. What could opponent have?\n- They could have a full house: A3, AT, AQ, AA (though AA unlikely as I have one ace)\n- They could have a worse ace: AK, AJ, A8, etc.\n- They could have a straight: KJ (would be Broadway straight A-K-Q-J-T)\n- They could have a flush draw that missed? No flush possible.\n- They could have been slowplaying a strong hand.\n\n**Opponent's line:**\n- Called preflop from BB (defending wide range)\n- Called flop bet on A-high board\n- Checked turn\n- Raised river after I bet\n\nThe river raise is interesting. They checked turn, so likely not a monster hand like full house or straight. But the river ace completes trips for anyone with an ace, and also makes full houses possible for hands like A3, AT, AQ.\n\n**My hand strength:**\nTrip aces with nine kicker is strong but vulnerable to better kickers or full houses. The fact that I have As means opponent can't have AA. But they could have AK, AJ, AT, AQ, A3.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nI need to call 12 to win 63 total (pot of 51 plus my call of 12). That's about 1:5.25 pot odds, or I need ~16% equity.\n\n**Range analysis:**\nWhat hands would opponent play this way?\n- Calling range from BB vs BTN raise: wide range including many aces, suited connectors, pairs\n- Calling flop on A-high board: could have ace, ten, queen, flush draws (none possible), straight draws\n- Checking turn: suggests medium strength or draw\n- Raising river after ace: could be value raising with better ace (AK, AJ, AT, AQ), full house (A3, AT, AQ), or bluff\n\nGiven the board, possible value hands:\n- AK (would raise preflop likely)\n- AJ (might call)\n- AT (makes full house)\n- AQ (makes full house)  \n- A3 (makes full house)\n- KJ (straight)\n- Maybe 33 for full house (would have raised flop or turn likely)\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have 173 chips (86.5 BB), opponent has 163. Not deep stacked. Folding leaves me with 161 chips (80.5 BB). Calling and losing leaves me with 149 chips (74.5 BB). Not a huge difference.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the limited data, opponent folded preflop in hand #1. No other history. This is a minimum raise on river, which often indicates medium strength - trying to get value from worse hands but not wanting to risk too much.\n\n**Decision:**\nI think I should call. Reasons:\n1. Pot odds are good (16% equity needed)\n2. My hand is trip aces, which beats many ace-x hands with worse kicker\n3. Opponent could be raising with AJ, A8, A7, etc.\n4.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this more carefully. I have trip aces with nine kicker. The board shows Ac, Ad, 3c, Th, Qd. The river brought the Ad, giving me trip aces. Opponent raised my river bet. \n\nWhat hands would opponent raise river with? They called flop, checked turn, then raised river when the third ace hit. This could be:\n1. A full house (A3, AT, AQ, 33, TT, QQ)\n2. A better ace (AK, AJ, maybe AT if they slowplayed)\n3. A bluff/semi-bluff\n\nThe fact they checked turn suggests they don't have a monster hand like a full house already on the turn. But the river ace makes full houses for many hands: A3, AT, AQ. Also 33 makes a full house but would likely have raised earlier.\n\nMy hand is essentially trip aces with nine kicker. If opponent has an ace with a better kicker (AK, AJ, AT, AQ), I lose. If opponent has a full house, I lose. If opponent has a worse ace (A8, A7, A6, A5, A4, A2), I win. If opponent is bluffing, I win.\n\nGiven the pot odds (call 12 to win 63), I need about 16% equity. Even if opponent only raises with better aces and full houses, I might still have some equity against bluffs or worse aces they think are value.\n\nBut wait, opponent made a minimum raise. This is often a value bet sizing - they want a call from worse hands. They're not trying to blow me off the hand.\n\nI should consider my own line: I raised preflop from BTN, bet flop, checked turn, bet river small. My line looks weak - like I have a medium ace or maybe missed. Opponent might be exploiting this.\n\nActually, let me calculate the pot size more carefully:\n- Preflop: I raised to 5, opponent called 3 more. Blinds were 1/2. So pot after preflop: 5 (my raise) + 3 (opponent's call) + 1 (SB) + 2 (BB) = 11\n- Flop: I bet 8, opponent called 8. Pot: 11 + 8 + 8 = 27\n- Turn: Both checked. Pot: 27\n- River: I bet 12, opponent raised to 24 total (so they put in 24, which is 12 more than my bet). Pot before my action: 27 + 12 + 24 = 63\n- I need to call 12 to win 63 + 12 = 75? Actually no, I'm calling 12 to win the pot of 63. So pot odds are 12:63 = 1:5.25, meaning I need ~16% equity.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and stack sizes, calling 12 chips (6 BB) to potentially win 63 chips (31.5 BB) seems reasonable even if I'm behind sometimes.\n\nBut what's the risk? If I call and lose, I'm at 161 chips. If I fold, I'm at 161 chips (since I already put in 12). Wait no - I already bet 12 on river. So if I fold now, I lose that 12. My stack would be 173 - 12 = 161. If I call and lose, I lose another 12, so 173 - 24 = 149. Actually, I've already put in: preflop 5, flop 8, river 12 = 25 total. My stack is 173, so I have 148 left? Let me track better.\n\nStarting stack: 173\nPreflop: raised to 5 \u2192 168 left\nFlop: bet 8 \u2192 160 left  \nRiver: bet 12 \u2192 148 left\nNow facing raise of 12 more \u2192 if I call, I'd have 136 left. If I fold, I have 148 left.\n\nSo the decision is: risk 12 more chips (going from 148 to 136) to win pot of 63. That's risking 12 to win 63, or ~5.25:1 odds.\n\nGiven these odds, I think I should call. Even if I'm behind to better aces or full houses sometimes, I might still win against worse aces or bluffs often enough to make it profitable.\n\nFinal decision: call.",

MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, SB) has shown some aggression - called a raise preflop in hand 2, called a flop bet, then raised on the river. GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, BB) has folded both hands preflop so far.\n\nMy hand is 9d Kh from the button. This is a marginal hand - K9o is not great, but being on the button with position is advantageous. The pot is 3 chips, I need to call 2 chips to see the flop. I have 235 chips (117.5 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\nConsidering my position and the fact that both blinds are relatively short-stacked (MiniMax-M2 has 162 chips, GPT-OSS-120B has 198 chips), I could consider raising to steal the blinds. However, K9o is not a great hand for raising, especially since MiniMax-M2 has shown some willingness to call and play postflop.\n\nThe minimum raise would be to 4 chips total. If I raise, I risk getting called by one or both blinds and playing a marginal hand out of position postflop (though I do have position on them).\n\nGiven the tournament context and my stack size, I should probably just fold this marginal hand. K9o doesn't play well multi-way, and I don't want to get involved with a weak hand. Better to wait for a better spot.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any value in calling to see a flop. For 2 chips (less than 1% of my stack), I could see a flop with position. If I hit a king or a good draw, I could continue. But K9o flops poorly - often top pair weak kicker which is hard to play.\n\nActually, given that I'm on the button and the blinds are relatively short, a small raise might be okay. But with K9o, I think folding is the disciplined play.\n\nWait, let me think about stack sizes again. I have 235 chips, SB has 162, BB has 198. A raise to 6 chips (3x) would be reasonable. If both fold, I win 3 chips. If called, I have position.\n\nBut actually, looking at opponent tendencies: GPT-OSS-120B has folded both hands preflop, so likely tight. MiniMax-M2 called a raise in hand 2, but that was from earlier position. As SB facing a button raise, he might defend wider.\n\nI think the conservative play is to fold. K9o is just too weak.

No need to take unnecessary risks with such a weak hand.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the data:\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is in the small blind, posted 1 chip\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is in the big blind, posted 2 chips\n   - Seat 2 folded\n   - No history of aggressive preflop raising from these opponents yet\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Only 2 chips to call into a 3 chip pot (1.5:1 odds), but with such a weak hand and bad position, these odds aren't good enough.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: Preserving my stack is important. Playing 53o from UTG is a recipe for disaster.\n\n7. **Future action**: If I call, I'll have to act first post-flop against 2-3 opponents. This hand has very low equity and little potential to improve to a strong hand.\n\nThis is an easy fold.

The action: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) limped, then Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 6 total (so a raise of 4 more after posting SB 1). I need to call 4 chips to continue.\n\nMy hand: 6c7c suited is a speculative hand. It's not strong preflop but has good potential to make straights and flushes. I'm getting decent pot odds: pot is 10 (2 BB + 2 from limper + 6 from raiser), I need to call 4, so pot odds are 10:4 or 2.5:1, which means I need ~28.6% equity.\n\nAgainst a typical raising range, 67s has about 30-35% equity against a tight range, and better against a wider range. However, I'm out of position (BB) against two opponents (raiser and limper who might call).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has shown some aggression with a raise in hand #4. Limped this hand, could be trapping or playing speculative.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Showed aggression in hand #5 with a raise to 14 preflop and continuation betting. This raise to 6 is smaller, could be a wider range.\n\nMy stack is 233 chips (116.5 BB) - deep stacked. The raiser has 169 chips (84.5 BB). If I call, I'll be playing a multiway pot out of position with a speculative hand.\n\nGiven the pot odds and implied odds (deep stacks), calling could be reasonable. However, 67s plays much better in position. Being in the BB against a raiser and potential caller is tough.\n\nAlternative: I could consider a 3-bet to take initiative, but 67s is not a great 3-betting hand, especially out of position.\n\nGiven the decent pot odds and deep stacks, I think calling is reasonable. Folding is also fine since the hand is marginal out of position.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns I should consider.",

Good for multi-way pots and suited connectors can make strong hands. But I'm facing a raise from the SB after a limp from UTG. This could be a squeeze play or a legitimate raise. I need to consider pot odds: pot is 10 chips, I need to call 4, so pot odds are 10:4 or 2.5:1, which means I need about 28.6% equity.\n\n67s has decent implied odds if I hit a strong draw or made hand. But I'm out of position against the raiser. My position is BB, so I'll be acting first postflop.\n\nLet me think about opponent tendencies. Seat 2 is Kimi-K2 (not the thinking version). Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking. Both seem to be AI players. Without specific reads, I should consider standard play.\n\nGiven I have 116.5 BB, calling 4 chips is a small investment. But I'm out of position. However, 67s plays well multi-way and has good implied odds. The raise size is small (3x BB from SB). This could be a wide range.\n\nI should probably call and see a flop. Folding seems too tight for these odds with a suited connector. Raising might be too aggressive with a speculative hand out of position.\n\nLet me respond.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with 6c7c on a flop of 8c Ts Ks. Pot is 18 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) checked after raising preflop. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is still in the hand. I have 229 chips (114.5 BB). \n\nMy hand: 6c7c is a suited connector, but only middle suited connector. Flop is 8c Ts Ks. I have a gutshot straight draw (9 needed for straight: 9-J-Q would give me a straight, but I need 9 specifically for a straight? Actually 6-7-8-9-T would be a straight, so I have an open-ended straight draw? Wait: 6-7-8-9-T is a straight, yes. I need a 9. Also 5-6-7-8-9 would be a straight, so I need a 9 or a 5. Actually 5 would give me 5-6-7-8, that's only a four-card straight. I need a 9 for the open-ended straight draw: 6-7-8-9-T. So I have an open-ended straight draw (8 outs). I also have a backdoor flush draw with two clubs (I have 6c7c, board has 8c Ts Ks - only one club on board, so backdoor flush draw). \n\nI have middle pair? No, I have 6 and 7, board is 8-T-K. No pair. So I have a draw.\n\nPosition: I'm in BB, last to act after Seat 2 checked. Seat 1 hasn't acted yet? Wait, the action order: preflop: Seat 2 (SB) raised, I called, Seat 1 called. Flop: Seat 2 checked. Now it's on Seat 1? Actually the description says \"flop: Seat 2 check\". Then \"Amount to call: 0\". That suggests it's my turn to act? But there are three players: Seat 1, Seat 2, and me (Seat 3). Seat 2 checked, so action goes to Seat 1? But maybe Seat 1 already acted? Let's see: The actions listed: preflop actions include Seat 1 call 2, Seat 2 raise 6, Seat 3 call 4, Seat 1 call 4. So Seat 1 is still in. On flop, only Seat 2 check is listed. That might mean Seat 1 checked? Or maybe Seat 1 hasn't acted yet? In typical order, after SB (Seat 2) checks, it goes to BB (me) if UTG (Seat 1) already acted? Actually preflop order: UTG (Seat 1) called, SB raised, BB called, UTG called. On flop, SB checks, then UTG acts, then BB. But the \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests there's no bet to call, so either UTG checked or hasn't acted yet. The interface might be showing me my action now because it's my turn after UTG checked. Probably Seat 1 checked as well, but not listed. Let me assume Seat 1 checked, so it's on me.\n\nThus I can check, raise, or fold. Folding is silly with a draw. I could check to see a free turn, or raise to semi-bluff. I need to consider opponent tendencies.\n\nLet me use tools to recall opponent actions. First, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop from SB. Let's see their tendencies. Use recall_opponent_actions for Seat 2.",

Seat 1 still to act after me.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop to 6 (3x BB). In hand #5, they raised to 14 preflop (7x BB) and then bet flop. Now they raised smaller and checked flop. This could indicate a weaker hand or they're checking to the preflop raiser (me? Actually I'm BB, seat 2 was SB who raised). Wait, seat 2 was SB who raised preflop, so they're the aggressor. Their check could be a check to the caller (me) or they might be checking a medium-strength hand.\n\nI have a draw: gutshot to a straight (need a 9) and backdoor flush. Not much equity right now. With two opponents, I should be cautious.\n\nGiven the board is K-T-8 with two spades, there are many better hands that could be out there: pairs of K, T, 8, flush draws, straight draws.\n\nSince amount to call is 0, I can check for free and see what seat 1 does. If I raise, I'd be bluffing with little equity, and seat 1 might call or raise with a better hand.\n\nBetter to check and see the turn. If I hit my draw on the turn, I can consider betting. Checking preserves my stack and allows me to realize my equity cheaply.\n\nDecision: Check.",

          "content": "I need to analyze this hand. I'm in the BB with 6c7c. Preflop: SB raised to 6 total (so min-raise from SB), I called from BB with 6c7s suited, UTG (Seat 1) called. Flop: 8c Ts Ks. SB checks, I check, UTG bets 28, SB raises to 80 (so raise of 52). Now action to me. Pot is 126 preflop? Let's calculate: Preflop: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, UTG called 2, SB raised to 6 total (so added 4), I called 4 more, UTG called 4 more. So pot preflop: 1+2+2+6+4+4 = 19? Wait that's not right. Let's compute: SB: 1 (post) + 5 (raise) = 6 total. BB: 2 (post) + 4 (call) = 6 total. UTG: 2 (call) + 4 (call) = 6 total. So pot preflop is 18. Then flop: UTG bets 28, SB raises to 80 (so adds 52 more). Current pot before my action: 18 + 28 + 80 = 126. Yes matches pot size given. Now I need to call 80. My stack is 229, so I have 229 - 6 = 223 left? Actually I already put in 6 preflop (2 BB post + 4 call). So I have 223 chips left. Calling 80 would leave me with 143. Pot after my call would be 126 + 80 = 206. If I call, there's still UTG to act behind me (Seat 1). He bet 28 and now faces a raise to 80. He could call, raise, or fold.\n\nMy hand: 6c7c on board 8c Ts Ks. I have a gutshot straight draw (9 gives me a straight: 9c? Actually 9 gives me 6-7-8-9-T straight, but board is 8-T-K, so I need a 9. That's 4 outs. Also I have a backdoor flush draw with two clubs (I have 6c7c, board has 8c Ts Ks - one club on board). So backdoor club flush draw. Also possibly a pair if I hit 6 or 7, but that's weak. So essentially a gutshot with backdoor flush. Not great.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 80 to win 206 (pot after my call). That's about 2.575:1 odds, or about 28% equity needed. My equity against likely ranges? Let's estimate. SB raised preflop from SB, UTG called pre then bet flop, SB check-raised. SB's range: could be strong: sets (88, TT, KK maybe? KK unlikely preflop raise small? But possible), two pair (K8, KT, K8s?), strong draws like AsQs, maybe pair+draw. UTG's range: could be top pair, draws, maybe middle pair. My equity against these ranges is likely low. Gutshot has 4 outs, but some outs may be dirty if someone has a flush draw. Clubs are somewhat clean but backdoor only. So I need about 28% equity. I doubt I have that.\n\nImplied odds: If I hit my straight on turn, I could win more chips. But stack sizes: SB has 89 total, he already put in 80? Wait SB's stack is 89. He raised to 80, so he has 9 left. Actually preflop he put in 6, now raised to 80 total? Let's compute: SB's stack is 89. Preflop he put in 6. So he has 83 left. He raised to 80 total? The action: \"Seat 2 raise 80\". That's the total amount he's putting in? In the description, \"raise 80\" likely means he raises to 80 total (i.e., adds 80 to his previous bet). But he checked, so his previous bet is 0. Actually he checked, then UTG bet 28, then SB raises to 80. That means SB puts in 80 total (i.e., adds 80 to the pot). So his remaining stack is 89 - 80 = 9. So he's basically all-in (he has 9 left). So SB is nearly all-in. UTG has 165 stack, bet 28, now faces raise to 80, so needs to call 52 more. He has plenty behind.\n\nThus"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this hand. I'm in the BB with 6c7c. Preflop: SB raised to 6 total (so min-raise from SB), I called from BB with 6c7s suited, UTG (Seat 1) called. Flop: 8c Ts Ks. SB checks, I check, UTG bets 28, SB raises to 80 (so raise of 52). Now action to me. Pot is 126 preflop? Let's calculate: Preflop: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, UTG called 2, SB raised to 6 total (so added 4), I called 4 more, UTG called 4 more. So pot preflop: 1+2+2+6+4+4 = 19? Wait that's not right. Let's compute: SB: 1 (post) + 5 (raise) = 6 total. BB: 2 (post) + 4 (call) = 6 total. UTG: 2 (call) + 4 (call) = 6 total. So pot preflop is 18. Then flop: UTG bets 28, SB raises to 80 (so adds 52 more). Current pot before my action: 18 + 28 + 80 = 126. Yes matches pot size given. Now I need to call 80. My stack is 229, so I have 229 - 6 = 223 left? Actually I already put in 6 preflop (2 BB post + 4 call). So I have 223 chips left. Calling 80 would leave me with 143. Pot after my call would be 126 + 80 = 206. If I call, there's still UTG to act behind me (Seat 1). He bet 28 and now faces a raise to 80. He could call, raise, or fold.\n\nMy hand: 6c7c on board 8c Ts Ks. I have a gutshot straight draw (9 gives me a straight: 9c? Actually 9 gives me 6-7-8-9-T straight, but board is 8-T-K, so I need a 9. That's 4 outs. Also I have a backdoor flush draw with two clubs (I have 6c7c, board has 8c Ts Ks - one club on board). So backdoor club flush draw. Also possibly a pair if I hit 6 or 7, but that's weak. So essentially a gutshot with backdoor flush. Not great.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 80 to win 206 (pot after my call). That's about 2.575:1 odds, or about 28% equity needed. My equity against likely ranges? Let's estimate. SB raised preflop from SB, UTG called pre then bet flop, SB check-raised. SB's range: could be strong: sets (88, TT, KK maybe? KK unlikely preflop raise small? But possible), two pair (K8, KT, K8s?), strong draws like AsQs, maybe pair+draw. UTG's range: could be top pair, draws, maybe middle pair. My equity against these ranges is likely low. Gutshot has 4 outs, but some outs may be dirty if someone has a flush draw. Clubs are somewhat clean but backdoor only. So I need about 28% equity. I doubt I have that.\n\nImplied odds: If I hit my straight on turn, I could win more chips. But stack sizes: SB has 89 total, he already put in 80? Wait SB's stack is 89. He raised to 80, so he has 9 left. Actually preflop he put in 6, now raised to 80 total? Let's compute: SB's stack is 89. Preflop he put in 6. So he has 83 left. He raised to 80 total? The action: \"Seat 2 raise 80\". That's the total amount he's putting in? In the description, \"raise 80\" likely means he raises to 80 total (i.e., adds 80 to his previous bet). But he checked, so his previous bet is 0. Actually he checked, then UTG bet 28, then SB raises to 80. That means SB puts in 80 total (i.e., adds 80 to the pot). So his remaining stack is 89 - 80 = 9. So he's basically all-in (he has 9 left). So SB is nearly all-in. UTG has 165 stack, bet 28, now faces raise to 80, so needs to call 52 more. He has plenty behind.\n\nThus",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to decide. Let's analyze:\n\nMy hand: 6c7c on 8c Ts Ks. I have a gutshot to a 9 (4 outs). Backdoor flush draw (need two clubs). Weak pair outs (6 or 7) likely not good.\n\nOpponent ranges:\n- Seat 2 (SB): He raised preflop from SB. His previous actions: Hand #5 he raised preflop to 14 (larger raise). Now he raised to 6 preflop (smaller). He check-raised flop aggressively, putting almost all his stack in (80 total, leaving 9). This looks very strong: likely top pair (KT, K8?), two pair, set, or strong draw like flush draw with AsQs maybe. He's committing his stack.\n\n- Seat 1 (UTG): He called preflop, bet flop 28 into 18 pot (big bet). He's facing a raise now. He could have top pair, middle pair, draw. He might fold or call.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 80 to win 206 (pot after my call). That's 80/206 = 38.8% equity needed. Actually pot odds: 80 to win 126 currently? Wait: pot before my call is 126. I need to call 80. If I call, pot becomes 206. My contribution is 80, so I need to win 80 out of 206, which is 38.8%. But if UTG also calls behind me, pot becomes larger, improving odds. But he might re-raise.\n\nEquity estimate: Gutshot straight draw (4 outs) ~ 8% per card, so 16% to hit by river. Backdoor flush draw adds maybe 4%. Pair outs maybe 6% but likely not clean. So total maybe 20-25% equity. Not enough for 38% required.\n\nImplied odds: If I hit my straight on turn, SB is almost all-in, so I can only win his remaining 9 chips. UTG has more chips but might not pay off if board gets scary. So implied odds are poor.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 229 chips (114.5 BB). This is a deep stack tournament. Folding leaves me with 223 chips (111.5 BB). Calling and losing leaves me with 143 chips (71.5 BB). That's still okay but significant loss.\n\nPosition: I'm out of position for rest of hand.\n\nOpponent tendencies: Seat 2 (SB) has shown aggression (raised preflop in hand #5, bet flop). Seat 1 (UTG) has been tight (folded many hands, only raised once preflop in hand #4).\n\nGiven all this, folding is correct. My hand is weak, pot odds not favorable, implied odds poor, and I'm facing strong action.\n\nThus, I should fold.",

Blinds are 1/2.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression (raised to 4 from SB in hand #5, then called a raise to 10). Also made a big turn bet of 74 in that hand. Generally seems somewhat active.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded preflop (folded 5 of 6 hands). Only called once from BB in hand #4, then folded to a raise. Seems tight/passive.\n\nMy hand: K\u2665 T\u2665 is a decent hand on the button. It's a suited broadway connector with good playability postflop. From the button, I have position advantage.\n\nStack sizes: I have 229 (biggest at table), SB has 194, BB has 194. So we're all fairly deep (around 100 BB).\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: Too conservative with a decent hand on button against likely weak blinds.\n2. Call: Could be okay, but gives SB and BB good odds to call with any two cards.\n3. Raise: Standard play with KTs on button. Should raise to 4-6 BB (8-12 chips).\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies:\n- SB might defend with a wide range if I just call\n- BB is tight and likely to fold to a raise\n- SB might defend with some hands but could fold to a raise\n\nI should raise to around 6 BB (12 chips) to put pressure on the blinds. This is a standard button steal attempt with a decent hand.\n\nLet me check if there are any relevant observations about button raises."

Blinds are 1/2.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression (raised to 4 from SB in hand #5, then called a raise to 10). Also made a big turn bet of 74 in that hand. Generally seems somewhat active.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded preflop (folded 5 of 6 hands). Only called once from BB in hand #4, then folded to a raise. Seems tight/passive.\n\nMy hand: K\u2665 T\u2665 is a decent hand on the button. It's a suited broadway connector with good playability postflop. From the button, I have position advantage.\n\nStack sizes: I have 229 (biggest at table), SB has 194, BB has 194. So we're all fairly deep (around 100 BB).\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: Too conservative with a decent hand on button against likely weak blinds.\n2. Call: Could be okay, but gives SB and BB good odds to call with any two cards.\n3. Raise: Standard play with KTs on button. Should raise to 4-6 BB (8-12 chips).\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies:\n- SB might defend with a wide range if I just call\n- BB is tight and likely to fold to a raise\n- SB might defend with some hands but could fold to a raise\n\nI should raise to around 6 BB (12 chips) to put pressure on the blinds.

Only the small blind and big blind are in the hand - I posted the small blind of 1, and MiniMax-M2 posted the big blind of 2. Everyone else folded. I need to call 1 more chip to see the flop.\n\nLooking at the opponent data: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has shown some aggression - they raised to 4 in hand #5 and hand #8 from the BB position when facing a limp or small bet. They also called a raise in hand #5 and continued postflop. So they're not overly tight.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 5s is a small pocket pair. From the button with only the BB left to act, this is a decent spot. The key is set mining - trying to hit a set on the flop (about 12% chance). With implied odds, if I hit my set, I could win a big pot.\n\nStack sizes: I have 232 chips, opponent has 197 chips. If I just call the 1 chip, the pot will be 3 chips preflop. If I raise, I could take it down preflop or build a pot.\n\nConsidering my position advantage (button), I could raise to try to steal the blinds. However, pocket 5s doesn't play well postflop if I miss, and I'm out of position against the BB if I just call.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n1. Fold: Too tight. Pocket 5s is playable from button vs BB.\n2. Call: Set mining for 1 chip more. Good implied odds if I hit.\n3. Raise: Could be good for stealing, but risks getting called or re-raised.\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to sometimes raise from BB, if I just call, they might raise. But actually, I'm the one acting - they've already posted BB and checked their option. So if I call, they'll check and we'll see a flop.\n\nI think calling is reasonable for set mining. The price is only 1 chip to potentially win 197 chips (opponent's stack). That's 1:197 implied odds, which is excellent for set mining (need about 1:10 to 1:15).\n\nHowever, raising to 4-6 chips could also be good. It might take it down preflop, and if called, I have position.\n\nLooking at my history: In hand #7 from BTN with KTs, I raised to 10 and won the blinds. So I've shown aggression from button before.\n\nI think a small raise is best here. Pocket 5s has some value, and I want to take initiative with position.

The BB has already checked their option (they posted BB and it's on me to act). I need to call 1 chip to see the flop. My options: fold, call, or raise.\n\nGiven my analysis: pocket 5s is a small pair good for set mining. Calling 1 chip gives me great implied odds (1:197). However, raising could be better to take initiative with position. The opponent has shown some aggression but not excessive.\n\nActually, wait - I'm in the small blind, not the button. The user said \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\" but then says \"Seat 3 post_sb 1\". That means I'm actually in the small blind, not the button. Let me re-read: \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\" but actions show \"Seat 3 post_sb 1\". This is confusing. If I posted SB, then I'm in the small blind, not button. But it says BTN. Maybe there's a mislabeling. In typical poker, SB posts 1, BB posts 2, button doesn't post. So if I posted SB, I'm SB, not BTN.\n\nActually looking at the players: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded, I'm Seat 3, Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, Seat 5 folded. So I'm in the small blind (seat 3), MiniMax is in BB (seat 4). That means I'm out of position postflop if I just call. That changes things.\n\nIf I'm out of position, set mining is less attractive because I can't control the pot as well. Raising might be better to take initiative. Or folding might be reasonable since pocket 5s out of position isn't great.\n\nBut the price is only 1 chip. With 232 chips, calling 1 chip to set mine is fine even out of position. If I miss, I can check-fold. If I hit, I can check-raise or lead out.\n\nActually, in the small blind facing just the BB, I should complete the blind (call the additional 1). That's standard with any reasonable hand. Pocket 5s is definitely worth completing.\n\nSo I'll call. No need to raise out of position with a small pair.\n\nBut wait, I could also raise to try to take it down preflop. Since I'm out of position, raising might be better to take control. But pocket 5s doesn't play well postflop if I raise and get called.\n\nI think completing (calling) is standard. Let me call.\n\nResponse should be JSON. Action: call (since amount to call is 1).

The board is relatively dry with no straight possibilities (except maybe 46 for a gutshot, but that's unlikely). There's a flush draw with two clubs.\n\nI'm heads-up against MiniMax-M2 in the BB. The pot is 4 chips, and I have 231 chips (115.5 BB). MiniMax-M2 has 197 chips. I'm in position, which is great.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's tendencies from the data:\n- They've shown some aggression with raises preflop (hands 5, 8)\n- They've made continuation bets on flops (hand 8)\n- They've shown willingness to call bets with draws or pairs (hand 5)\n- They've also folded to aggression (hand 5 on turn)\n\nGiven that I have a set, I want to build the pot. Since the pot is only 4 chips and I'm in position, I have several options:\n\n1. Check: This might induce a bluff from MiniMax-M2, but with such a small pot, it might not build much value.\n2. Bet small: A small bet (2-4 chips) could look like a probe bet and might get called by many hands.\n3. Bet larger: A bigger bet (6-8 chips) could build the pot faster.\n\nConsidering the board texture (dry with a flush draw), and my strong hand, I should bet to build the pot. MiniMax-M2 might call with any piece of the board (any 8, any 5, any 3, flush draws, straight draws).\n\nGiven my position and stack sizes, I think a small to medium bet is appropriate. Let's say 4 chips (pot-sized bet). This would make the pot 8 chips total, and if called, we'd have a 12 chip pot going to the turn.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions: I can check or raise (since amount to call is 0). I should bet to build the pot. Let me check the minimum raise is 2, but I can raise to any amount up to my stack.\n\nI think I'll make a small bet to start building the pot. Let's go with 4 chips (pot-sized bet). This is reasonable and not too scary."

That seems reasonable. I'll raise to 6 total (which is a bet of 4, since I already have 1 in from SB and need to add 5 more? Wait, let me think.\n\nI posted SB 1, then called 1 more preflop, so I have 2 chips in the pot already. The pot is 4 chips total. If I want to bet 4 chips, that means I need to raise to 6 total (2 already in + 4 more).

Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise. The minimum raise is to 6 total (which would be a bet of 6 since there's no bet to call).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has shown some aggression. In hand #5, they bet 74 on the turn. In hand #8, they bet 6 on the flop. They've shown willingness to bet when they have something.\n\nOn the flop, I bet 6 and they called. They could have:\n1. A flush draw (clubs)\n2. A straight draw (maybe 46, 67)\n3. A pair (8, 3, or maybe overcards)\n4. A slow-played monster (88, 33)\n\nGiven the board has paired 3s, many draws are still possible. The flush draw (clubs) is still there. Straight draws need a 6 or 7.\n\nWith my full house, I want to extract value. I should bet to charge draws and get value from pairs. Since I'm first to act, I could check to induce a bluff from MiniMax-M2, but given their tendency to bet on the turn in hand #5, they might take a stab if I check.\n\nHowever, with such a strong hand, I should probably bet for value. The pot is 16, so a bet of around 8-12 seems reasonable. I have position (BTN) and will act last on the river.\n\nConsidering stack sizes: I have 225, opponent has 191. A bet of 10-12 would be reasonable.

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted the small blind (1 chip), Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted the big blind (2 chips), and Seat 1 folded. So I'm first to act preflop after the blinds.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised preflop in 2 out of 10 hands (Hands 5 and 8), both times to 4 chips. This suggests they might be aggressive from the small blind.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) hasn't raised preflop yet, but we only have limited data.\n\nI have pocket Kings, which is the second-best starting hand in Texas Hold'em (only behind Aces). This is a premium hand that I want to build a pot with. I'm on the button, which is the best position postflop.\n\nGiven my strong hand and position, I should raise. The minimum raise is to 4 chips, but with Kings I want to make a larger raise to build the pot and potentially isolate one opponent. Standard raise sizes in tournaments are often 2.5-3x the big blind, but with Kings I might go larger.\n\nMy stack is 241 chips (120.5 BB), so I have plenty of chips. The blinds are small relative to my stack. I should consider raising to 6-8 chips (3-4x BB). Since Seat 4 (SB) has shown aggression with raises to 4 chips, they might call or re-raise. Seat 5 (BB) might defend their blind.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (120.5 BB), so I can afford to play this hand aggressively. Pocket Kings is a hand worth accumulating chips with.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips (3x BB). This is a standard raise size that builds the pot while not committing too much. If I get re-raised, I can consider going all-in depending on the action.\n\nWait, actually looking at the action: Seat 4 posted SB (1), Seat 5 posted BB (2), Seat 1 folded. So I'm first to act. The amount to call is 2 (the BB). Minimum raise is to 4 (double the BB). I can raise to any amount up to my stack.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips total (adding 4 more to the 2 to call). This is a 3x BB raise.",

I need to call 2 to match the BB, or raise to at least 4.\n\nThis is an extremely strong hand preflop - second best starting hand only to aces. I'm on the button, which is the best position. Looking at the opponents: MiniMax-M2 (SB, seat 4) and GPT-OSS-120B (BB, seat 5). From the search results, I can see both opponents have been playing reasonably - MiniMax-M2 raised with Td 2d from UTG in hand 8, which is a bit loose. GPT-OSS-120B folded in most situations.\n\nWith pocket kings, I definitely want to raise to build the pot and get value. A standard raise would be 3-4x the BB, so 6-8 chips. Since minimum raise is to 4, I should raise more to get value and potentially isolate one opponent.\n\nMy stack is 241 chips, opponents have 190 and 191. I have a slight chip lead. I want to build a pot but not scare everyone away. Let me think about sizing: if I raise to 8 (4x BB), that's a reasonable size.

The blinds are 1/2, so I have plenty of room to maneuver.\n\nA7s is not a great UTG hand. It has some potential with flush possibilities, but it's dominated by many better aces (AJ+, AT+, A9s). From UTG, I should be playing tighter.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 raised from UTG with T2d (suited) in hand #8, showing they might play somewhat loose from early position\n- GPT-OSS-120B has folded to all raises so far\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking called a min-raise from BB in hand #8\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, the standard play is to fold A7s from UTG. However, I could consider a raise to 10-12 chips (5-6 BB) to try to steal the blinds, but with two players behind who might call or 3-bet, that's risky.\n\nLet me check my own history to see if I've been playing aggressively.",

This is their first aggressive action (raise to 30). This suggests they have a strong hand given their tight folding pattern.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has raised preflop twice before (both small raises to 4), and called my raise.\n\nMy hand: Pocket Tens is a strong hand, but vulnerable to overcards. With a 3-bet from a previously tight player (GPT-OSS-120B), I need to be cautious. The pot is 51 chips, and I need to call 20 more. That's pot odds of 20 to win 71 (51+20), or about 3.55:1, which is good.\n\nHowever, I'm out of position (SB), and there's still Seat 4 to act after me. If I call, Seat 4 might come along or re-raise.\n\nStack sizes: I have 234 total. I've already put in 12 chips (2 BB + 10 raise). Calling 20 more would put 32 total, leaving 202 behind. Raising to 50 would put 50 total, leaving 184 behind.\n\nGiven GPT-OSS-120B's tight folding history, their 3-bet likely represents a strong range: JJ+, AK, maybe AQs. My Tens are behind QQ+, tied with JJ, ahead of TT (same), and ahead of AK/AQ.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (117 BB). Folding preserves my stack. Calling keeps the pot manageable but puts me out of position. Raising commits more chips and could lead to a 4-bet or all-in from the tight player.\n\nGiven the tight player's first aggressive move, I should be cautious. However, pocket Tens is a strong hand, and the pot odds are good. I think calling is reasonable to see a flop and reassess. If I hit a set (22% chance), I can stack them.

Preflop action: SB posted 1, I posted BB 2, then two callers, SB folded, I raised to 10, one caller, then Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 30, I called 20, other caller folded. So heads-up with Seat 5 going to flop.\n\nFlop: As Jh 7c. I have middle pair with tens, but there's an Ace on board. Seat 5 raised preflop, so their range likely includes strong hands: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe AJ, maybe some suited connectors. They could have Ace-x, maybe AJ, AQ, AK, maybe AA, JJ. I have to consider their raise size: they made it 30 total after my raise to 10. That's a 3x raise from my raise. That's a pretty strong raise.\n\nNow flop: Ace high board. This is bad for my tens. If they have an Ace, I'm crushed. If they have JJ, I'm crushed. If they have KK or QQ, they might continue. But they raised preflop, so they could have AK, AQ, AJ, maybe ATs. I'm behind most of their range.\n\nPot is 71 chips. My stack is 214. Amount to call is 0, so I can check. I can also raise. But raising seems dangerous. If I check, they might bet. If they bet, I have to decide whether to call. I have backdoor straight draw (if a Q and K come maybe? Actually T on board, need 9 and 8 for straight? Not really). I have a pair of tens, but likely behind.\n\nI should recall opponent tendencies. Let me use tools to see past actions by Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). Also maybe search for their behavior. Let me first recall opponent actions.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have Tc Td (pocket tens) on a board of As Jh 7c. This is a tough flop with an Ace on board. My tens are now essentially a bluff catcher at best. The only hands I'm beating are smaller pairs (99, 88, etc.) and maybe some draws.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, out of position against seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) who is the only other player in the hand.\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at the recall data, seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been very tight - folding preflop in 11 out of 12 hands, and only seeing a flop once in hand 3 where they had 8h2h and checked all streets. In hand 4, they called 1 chip (likely the SB) then folded to a raise. This suggests they're playing very conservatively.\n\n4. **Action this hand**: Preflop, seat 4 called, seat 5 called, I raised to 10 from BB, seat 4 called, then seat 5 raised to 30, I called 20 more, seat 4 folded. So seat 5's 3-bet to 30 is significant - they put in 30 total when facing my 10 raise. With their tight tendencies, this 3-bet likely represents a strong hand.\n\n5. **Board texture**: As Jh 7c - Ace high, rainbow likely (no flush draws). This hits a lot of strong hands that seat 5 could have 3-bet with: AA, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe AJ.\n\n6. **Stack sizes**: I have 214 chips, seat 5 has 160 chips. Pot is 71 chips.\n\n7. **Current action**: It's the flop, amount to call is 0, I can check or raise. Given the Ace on board and seat 5's tight 3-betting range, checking seems prudent.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: I have 214 chips (107 BB), which is a decent stack. No need to get involved in a marginal spot against what appears to be a strong hand.\n\nGiven seat 5's tight tendencies and their preflop 3-bet, they likely have a strong hand that connects well with this A-high board. My pocket tens are in bad shape against their range (AA, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe AJ). Even if they have QQ or KK, I'm still behind. Best case is they have a smaller pair like 99 or 88, but that seems unlikely given their 3-bet.\n\nI should check and see what they do. If they bet small, I might consider calling to see a turn, but if they bet big, I should likely fold. For now, check and evaluate.",

Opponent GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop (9 of 10 hands). This is their first significant action.\n2. Preflop action: I raised from BB to 10, then opponent 3-bet to 30. I called. This suggests opponent has a strong hand.\n3. The flop is As Jh 7c - Ace high board. This is a terrible flop for my pocket tens. The Ace is a major concern.\n4. Opponent now bets 80 chips (their entire remaining stack). This is a pot-sized bet.\n5. I have 214 chips total. If I call 80, I'll have 134 left. The pot will be 311 chips.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- My pocket tens are likely behind. An Ace on the flop means any Ace-x hand beats me.\n- Opponent's preflop 3-bet range likely includes: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe AJs, TT, 99.\n- Given the Ace on board, they could have: AK, AQ, AJ, AT, maybe AA (though less likely with one Ace on board).\n- They could also have an overpair like KK, QQ that's now scared of the Ace.\n- They could have JJ for a set.\n- They could have a big draw like KQs with backdoor flush potential.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Need to call 80 to win 311 (151 current pot + 80 opponent bet + my 80 call)\n- Pot odds: 80/(311) = 25.7%\n- I need ~26% equity to call.\n\n**Equity considerations:**\nAgainst a tight range of:\n- AK, AQ, AJ, AT, AA, KK, QQ, JJ\nMy equity is likely low. Against just AK, I have ~10% equity. Against a wider range including some bluffs, maybe 20-30%.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 107 BBs, which is a healthy stack.\n- Opponent has only 40 BBs (80 chips).\n- Folding leaves me with 214 chips (107 BBs).\n- Calling and losing leaves me with 134 chips (67 BBs) - still playable.\n- If I win, I'll have 294 chips (147 BBs).\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- They've been folding a lot, so when they do play, they likely have a strong hand.\n- The all-in bet on the flop after 3-betting preflop suggests real strength.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a tough spot. The Ace on board is terrible for my tens. While the pot odds are tempting (25.7%), I don't think I have enough equity against their likely range. The opponent has shown strength preflop and now is committing their entire stack. This looks like they have at least an Ace, possibly AK, AQ, or AJ. They could also have an overpair like KK or QQ, but even those have me crushed.\n\nGiven that:\n1. Board has an Ace\n2. Opponent 3-bet preflop\n3. Opponent is shoving all-in on flop\n4. I have middle pair with poor kicker\n5. I have a healthy stack to preserve\n\nI should fold. The risk/reward isn't favorable.\n\nHowever, let me consider if there's any chance they're bluffing. Given their tight folding history, this seems unlikely. They've waited for a hand and are now playing it aggressively.\n\nI'll fold."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand: Tc Td (pocket tens)**\n**Board: As Jh 7c**\n**Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) with 80 chips total**\n**Pot: 151 chips**\n**Amount to call: 80 chips**\n**My stack: 214 chips**\n\nKey observations:\n1. Opponent GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop (9 of 10 hands). This is their first significant action.\n2. Preflop action: I raised from BB to 10, then opponent 3-bet to 30. I called. This suggests opponent has a strong hand.\n3. The flop is As Jh 7c - Ace high board. This is a terrible flop for my pocket tens. The Ace is a major concern.\n4. Opponent now bets 80 chips (their entire remaining stack). This is a pot-sized bet.\n5. I have 214 chips total. If I call 80, I'll have 134 left. The pot will be 311 chips.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- My pocket tens are likely behind. An Ace on the flop means any Ace-x hand beats me.\n- Opponent's preflop 3-bet range likely includes: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe AJs, TT, 99.\n- Given the Ace on board, they could have: AK, AQ, AJ, AT, maybe AA (though less likely with one Ace on board).\n- They could also have an overpair like KK, QQ that's now scared of the Ace.\n- They could have JJ for a set.\n- They could have a big draw like KQs with backdoor flush potential.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Need to call 80 to win 311 (151 current pot + 80 opponent bet + my 80 call)\n- Pot odds: 80/(311) = 25.7%\n- I need ~26% equity to call.\n\n**Equity considerations:**\nAgainst a tight range of:\n- AK, AQ, AJ, AT, AA, KK, QQ, JJ\nMy equity is likely low. Against just AK, I have ~10% equity. Against a wider range including some bluffs, maybe 20-30%.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 107 BBs, which is a healthy stack.\n- Opponent has only 40 BBs (80 chips).\n- Folding leaves me with 214 chips (107 BBs).\n- Calling and losing leaves me with 134 chips (67 BBs) - still playable.\n- If I win, I'll have 294 chips (147 BBs).\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- They've been folding a lot, so when they do play, they likely have a strong hand.\n- The all-in bet on the flop after 3-betting preflop suggests real strength.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a tough spot. The Ace on board is terrible for my tens. While the pot odds are tempting (25.7%), I don't think I have enough equity against their likely range. The opponent has shown strength preflop and now is committing their entire stack. This looks like they have at least an Ace, possibly AK, AQ, or AJ. They could also have an overpair like KK or QQ, but even those have me crushed.\n\nGiven that:\n1. Board has an Ace\n2. Opponent 3-bet preflop\n3. Opponent is shoving all-in on flop\n4. I have middle pair with poor kicker\n5. I have a healthy stack to preserve\n\nI should fold. The risk/reward isn't favorable.\n\nHowever, let me consider if there's any chance they're bluffing. Given their tight folding history, this seems unlikely. They've waited for a hand and are now playing it aggressively.\n\nI'll fold.",

Calling or raising with such weak cards would likely just lose chips. I'm in SB position which normally has some advantage, but with 2h 8c, I have minimal chance to win.

From the opponent action data:\n\n- MiniMax-M2 has mostly folded preflop, called twice (once in hand 13 where there was a lot of action)\n- GPT-OSS-120B has mostly folded preflop, but showed aggression in hand 13 with a raise to 30 and a big bet on the flop\n\nI'm on the button, which is a great position, but with 72o, this hand has almost no value. The only reason to play it would be to steal the blinds, but:\n\n1. The blinds are relatively small compared to stacks (106.5 BB deep)\n2. Both opponents have shown they're willing to call/defend their blinds (MiniMax-M2 called in hand 13, GPT-OSS-120B has shown aggression)\n3. If I raise and get called, I'll be playing a terrible hand out of position postflop\n4. Even if I successfully steal, I only gain 3 chips\n\nThe risk/reward is terrible. If I raise to say 6 chips (standard 3x), I'm risking 6 to win 3. If either blind calls or 3-bets, I'm in a terrible spot with 72o.\n\nBetter to just fold this trash hand and wait for a better spot. I have a healthy stack (213 chips, 106.5 BB), so there's no need to get involved with such a bad hand.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern of the blinds folding to button raises... Actually, from the data, both blinds have shown willingness to defend. MiniMax-M2 folded a lot but also called. GPT-OSS-120B showed aggression in hand 13.\n\nGiven all this, folding is clearly the best play."

I'm on the button with 2c 7d, which is an absolutely terrible hand - 72o is one of the worst possible starting hands in poker. The blinds are 1/2, I have 213 chips (106.5 BB), so I'm deep stacked.\n\nLooking at the opponents: MiniMax-M2 is in the small blind (177 chips) and GPT-OSS-120B is in the big blind (229 chips). From the opponent action data:\n\n- MiniMax-M2 has mostly folded preflop, called twice (once in hand 13 where there was a lot of action)\n- GPT-OSS-120B has mostly folded preflop, but showed aggression in hand 13 with a raise to 30 and a big bet on the flop\n\nI'm on the button, which is a great position, but with 72o, this hand has almost no value. The only reason to play it would be to steal the blinds, but:\n\n1. The blinds are relatively small compared to stacks (106.5 BB deep)\n2. Both opponents have shown they're willing to call/defend their blinds (MiniMax-M2 called in hand 13, GPT-OSS-120B has shown aggression)\n3. If I raise and get called, I'll be playing a terrible hand out of position postflop\n4. Even if I successfully steal, I only gain 3 chips\n\nThe risk/reward is terrible. If I raise to say 6 chips (standard 3x), I'm risking 6 to win 3. If either blind calls or 3-bets, I'm in a terrible spot with 72o.\n\nBetter to just fold this trash hand and wait for a better spot. I have a healthy stack (213 chips, 106.5 BB), so there's no need to get involved with such a bad hand.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern of the blinds folding to button raises... Actually, from the data, both blinds have shown willingness to defend. MiniMax-M2 folded a lot but also called. GPT-OSS-120B showed aggression in hand 13.\n\nGiven all this, folding is clearly the best play.",

It has very little potential to make strong hands postflop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the small blind. This is a terrible position to play marginal hands from because I'll be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 213 chips (106.5 BB) - Healthy stack, no need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Opponent action**: Kimi-K2 Thinking raised to 6 from UTG+1 (seat 1). Looking at their history, they've raised once before in hand #14 (same 6 chip raise). They've mostly been folding preflop (6 out of 7 hands). This suggests they might have a decent hand when they do raise.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 5 chips to win 9, which is 1.8:1 odds (need ~35.7% equity). My hand has nowhere near that against a likely raising range.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should avoid playing weak hands out of position against early position raises. The blinds are small relative to our stack (106.5 BB), so there's no pressure to accumulate chips urgently.\n\n7. **The BB still to act**: MiniMax-M2 in the BB still has to act after me. They could potentially re-raise, making my situation even worse.\n\n8. **Hand 14 similarity**: In hand #14, I was in the SB with 2h 8c and folded to the same opponent's 6 chip raise. That was the correct play, and 32o is even worse than 28o.\n\nConclusion: This is an easy fold. Playing 32o out of position against an early position raise is a recipe for losing chips. The pot odds don't justify calling with such a weak hand that has terrible implied odds (even if we hit something like a pair, we could easily be dominated).\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"32o is one of the worst starting hands.

The only concern is if my opponent has a higher pocket pair or a 2 for trips, but that's less likely given the action.\n\nI should consider betting for value.

The flop is 2h 2c 4h, so it's a paired board with low cards. MiniMax-M2 checked to me.\n\nLooking at the history: MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression with pocket 5s (hand 10) where they called a flop bet and folded turn. They also called a preflop raise with TT (hand 13) but folded to a 3-bet. They've shown some bluffing tendencies with weak hands like Q8 (hand 16) where they bet turn on a Qd Kc 7c 7s board and won.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 6s on a 2-2-4 board. This is a decent spot. The board is paired with deuces, which reduces the chance opponent has a 2 (only 2 left in deck). My 6s are likely best here unless opponent has an overpair, a 4, or a pocket pair higher than 6s.\n\nPosition: I'm in position on the button, which is advantageous.\n\nPot: 18 chips. My stack: 205, opponent: 173.\n\nI should consider betting for value. Many hands that called preflop from SB could be suited connectors, small pairs, or broadway cards. A 2-2-4 flop misses most of those ranges. My 6s are ahead of most of their range.\n\nI could check back to see a turn card, but betting seems better to get value from draws (hearts), overcards, or smaller pairs. The board has a heart draw, so I should bet to charge draws.\n\nBet sizing: Pot is 18. A bet of 9-12 seems reasonable. Minimum raise is 6, but I can bet any amount above that.\n\nLet me check opponent's tendencies more. They folded TT to a 3-bet preflop. They called with 55 and folded turn. They bluffed with Q8. They seem somewhat cautious but capable of bluffing.\n\nI think a bet of 10-12 chips is good. I'll go with 12.",

I need to call 24. My stack is 193 chips.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see MiniMax-M2's tendencies:\n- In hand #15 (BTN vs BB), they bet 6 on turn with board 8s 8h 2d 4d, holding 2c 7d (they had bottom pair with weak kicker)\n- In hand #16 (UTG vs BB), they bet 8 on turn with board Qd Kc 7c 7s, holding Qc 8d (top pair weak kicker)\n- In hand #5 (need to see more context)\n\nLooking at this hand's history:\n- Preflop: I raised to 8 from BTN, MiniMax-M2 called from SB\n- Flop: 2h 2c 4h - they checked, I bet 12, they called\n- Turn: 8c - they now bet 24\n\nBoard analysis: The board is 2h 2c 4h 8c. My hand: 6c 6s. This gives me:\n- Pocket sixes\n- Board has two deuces (paired board)\n- No straight draws for me (need 3-5 or 5-7)\n- Backdoor flush draw with 6c (club)\n- Essentially I have an underpair to the board's pair\n\nWhat could MiniMax-M2 have?\n- They called preflop from SB, so range includes small pairs, suited connectors, broadway cards\n- They called flop bet on 2h 2c 4h board\n- Now betting turn when 8c comes\n\nPossible hands for them:\n1. A deuce (trips) - would likely check-raise flop or bet flop\n2. A four (pair of fours) - possible but weak\n3. An eight (pair of eights) - just hit on turn\n4. Flush draw with hearts (board has 2h 4h)\n5. Straight draw (3-5, 5-7)\n6. Overpair like 99+ (less likely they'd just call preflop)\n\nPot odds: I need to call 24 to win pot of 66 + 24 = 90. That's 24/90 = 26.7% equity needed.\n\nMy equity against various ranges:\n- Against trips (a deuce): I have ~4% equity (need two sixes)\n- Against pair of eights: I have ~18% equity (need to hit a six)\n- Against flush draw: I have ~70% equity (ahead)\n- Against straight draw: I have ~70% equity (ahead)\n\nMy stack: 193 chips (96.5 BB). MiniMax-M2 has 137 chips. If I call, pot will be 114, and effective stack behind will be 193-24 = 169.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack. Being cautious with marginal hands is reasonable.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's betting patterns from search:\n- They tend to bet when they hit something (hand #15 bet with bottom pair, hand #16 bet with top pair weak kicker)\n- Their bet sizes are moderate (6, 8, 24 here)\n\nThe 24 bet into 66 pot is about 36% pot - a standard value bet size.\n\nGiven the paired board and my underpair, I'm likely behind. The turn bet suggests they have at least a pair, possibly trips or an eight. My sixes are vulnerable - any overcard (9+) beats me if they have overcards.\n\nHowever, I have position and could call to see river. But implied odds are poor - if I hit a six (2 outs), I might not get paid much. Reverse implied odds are bad - if I call and they bet river, I'll have to fold.\n\nGiven pot odds of 26.7% and my likely equity being less than that against most value hands, folding seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's bluff potential. They could be betting a flush draw or straight draw. Board is 2h 2c 4h 8c - heart flush draw is possible. They might have AhXh or similar.\n\nActually, looking at hand #10: I had 5s5c and bet flop and turn, they folded on turn with 5s5c. So they can fold to aggression.\n\nBut here, they're the one betting. Given their history of betting for value with marginal hands, this looks like a value bet.\n\nI"

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nCurrent hand: I'm on the button with 6c 6s. Board is 2h 2c 4h 8c. Pot is 66 chips. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB) has bet 24 on the turn. I need to call 24. My stack is 193 chips.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see MiniMax-M2's tendencies:\n- In hand #15 (BTN vs BB), they bet 6 on turn with board 8s 8h 2d 4d, holding 2c 7d (they had bottom pair with weak kicker)\n- In hand #16 (UTG vs BB), they bet 8 on turn with board Qd Kc 7c 7s, holding Qc 8d (top pair weak kicker)\n- In hand #5 (need to see more context)\n\nLooking at this hand's history:\n- Preflop: I raised to 8 from BTN, MiniMax-M2 called from SB\n- Flop: 2h 2c 4h - they checked, I bet 12, they called\n- Turn: 8c - they now bet 24\n\nBoard analysis: The board is 2h 2c 4h 8c. My hand: 6c 6s. This gives me:\n- Pocket sixes\n- Board has two deuces (paired board)\n- No straight draws for me (need 3-5 or 5-7)\n- Backdoor flush draw with 6c (club)\n- Essentially I have an underpair to the board's pair\n\nWhat could MiniMax-M2 have?\n- They called preflop from SB, so range includes small pairs, suited connectors, broadway cards\n- They called flop bet on 2h 2c 4h board\n- Now betting turn when 8c comes\n\nPossible hands for them:\n1. A deuce (trips) - would likely check-raise flop or bet flop\n2. A four (pair of fours) - possible but weak\n3. An eight (pair of eights) - just hit on turn\n4. Flush draw with hearts (board has 2h 4h)\n5. Straight draw (3-5, 5-7)\n6. Overpair like 99+ (less likely they'd just call preflop)\n\nPot odds: I need to call 24 to win pot of 66 + 24 = 90. That's 24/90 = 26.7% equity needed.\n\nMy equity against various ranges:\n- Against trips (a deuce): I have ~4% equity (need two sixes)\n- Against pair of eights: I have ~18% equity (need to hit a six)\n- Against flush draw: I have ~70% equity (ahead)\n- Against straight draw: I have ~70% equity (ahead)\n\nMy stack: 193 chips (96.5 BB). MiniMax-M2 has 137 chips. If I call, pot will be 114, and effective stack behind will be 193-24 = 169.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack. Being cautious with marginal hands is reasonable.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's betting patterns from search:\n- They tend to bet when they hit something (hand #15 bet with bottom pair, hand #16 bet with top pair weak kicker)\n- Their bet sizes are moderate (6, 8, 24 here)\n\nThe 24 bet into 66 pot is about 36% pot - a standard value bet size.\n\nGiven the paired board and my underpair, I'm likely behind. The turn bet suggests they have at least a pair, possibly trips or an eight. My sixes are vulnerable - any overcard (9+) beats me if they have overcards.\n\nHowever, I have position and could call to see river. But implied odds are poor - if I hit a six (2 outs), I might not get paid much. Reverse implied odds are bad - if I call and they bet river, I'll have to fold.\n\nGiven pot odds of 26.7% and my likely equity being less than that against most value hands, folding seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's bluff potential. They could be betting a flush draw or straight draw. Board is 2h 2c 4h 8c - heart flush draw is possible. They might have AhXh or similar.\n\nActually, looking at hand #10: I had 5s5c and bet flop and turn, they folded on turn with 5s5c. So they can fold to aggression.\n\nBut here, they're the one betting. Given their history of betting for value with marginal hands, this looks like a value bet.\n\nI",

With K4o, this is a clear fold from UTG. The hand has very little potential - it's offsuit, not connected, and the king is weak with a 4 kicker. Even if I hit a king, I could be dominated by better kickers.\n\nGiven my stack size (96.5 BB), I should be playing tight from early position and preserving chips. The blinds are small relative to my stack, so there's no pressure to play marginal hands.\n\nAlso, looking at my recent history, I've been folding a lot (13 folds out of 19 hands), which is fine - I should be playing tight in a tournament.\n\nI should fold this hand and wait for a better spot from better position or with stronger cards.",

The pot is 48 chips after the action: SB (Seat 1) posted 2, I posted 4, Seat 4 raised to 8, Seat 5 called 8, and then Seat 1 (SB) 3-bet to 28 total (raising by 20 more).\n\nI need to call 24 chips (28 total minus my 4 BB). My stack is 189 chips (47.2 BB). The pot odds: I need to call 24 to win 48+8+8+28 = 92 chips (pot of 48 + 24 call + 20 from SB's raise). Actually let me calculate: Current pot is 48 (2+4+8+8+26? Wait, Seat 1 raised to 28 total, which includes their 2 SB, so they added 26 more). Actually the pot before Seat 1's action: SB 2, BB 4, Seat 4 raise to 8, Seat 5 call 8 = 22. Then Seat 1 raises to 28 total, adding 26 more. So pot is now 22+26=48. I need to call 24 to win 48+24=72 if no one else calls. But Seat 4 and 5 still have to act after me.\n\nFrom the opponent history:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has raised preflop a couple times (hand 14 and 18 raised to 6). In hand 6 showdown had 9s8s. Seems somewhat aggressive.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has called preflop bets, showed down with weak hands like 9dTs and 4d8c.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded preflop, raised once in hand 20, showed down with 8h2h.\n\nMy hand K9o is marginal, especially facing a 3-bet. I'm out of position (BB) and will have to act first on every street. The 3-bet from the SB suggests strength - could be a wide range since it's a squeeze play against the initial raiser and caller.\n\nPot odds: 24 to call into 48 pot = 2:1 odds (33% equity needed). K9o has maybe 30-35% equity against a typical 3-bet range? But I'm also worried about the original raiser and caller behind me - they could re-raise or call, making the pot multi-way which could be good or bad for K9o.\n\nMy stack is 189 chips (47 BB). Calling 24 chips would put 12.7% of my stack in preflop. That's significant but not devastating.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm not the shortest stack (Seat 2 has 0, folded), but I'm below average. Seat 1 has 342, Seat 4 has 207, Seat 5 has 208.\n\nGiven the weak hand, out of position, facing a 3-bet, and with two players left to act behind me, folding seems prudent. K9o doesn't play well multi-way or against aggression. The pot odds are decent but implied odds are poor since I'm out of position and the board will likely miss my hand.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns from Seat 1's 3-bets. Let me search for more info.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to think about this situation. I'm in the BB with K9 offsuit. There was a raise to 8 from seat 4, a call from seat 5, and then a 3-bet to 28 from seat 1 (the small blind). I need to call 24 chips.\n\nLet me analyze:\n1. My hand: K9o is not a strong hand, especially out of position. It's dominated by many hands that would 3-bet.\n2. Position: I'm in the BB, so I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand against multiple players.\n3. Stack sizes: I have 189 chips (47 BB), which is a decent stack. Seat 1 has 342, seat 4 has 207, seat 5 has 208.\n4. The pot: Currently 48 chips (2+4+8+8+28? Wait, let me calculate: SB posted 2, I posted BB 4, seat 4 raised to 8, seat 5 called 8, seat 1 raised to 28). So pot is 2+4+8+8+28 = 50? Actually, seat 1's raise includes his SB, so total in pot: SB 2, BB 4, seat 4's 8, seat 5's 8, seat 1's additional 26 (28 total - 2 SB) = 48 chips. Yes, pot is 48.\n5. I need to call 24 to win 48, so pot odds are 2:1.\n6. Opponent tendencies: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has shown some aggression - raised to 6 in hand 18 preflop, but otherwise folded. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been calling and betting in some hands. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) just called the initial raise.\n\nWith K9o, facing a 3-bet from the small blind, I'm likely dominated. Even if I hit a pair, I could be up against better kings or better pairs. Being out of position makes it worse. The pot odds are decent (2:1), but implied odds are poor because I'm out of position and could face more betting.\n\nIn tournament poker, preserving my stack is important. K9o is a fold in this spot, especially facing a 3-bet. I should wait for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. The minimum raise to is 48, which would be a significant portion of my stack. Not worth it with this hand.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

The player in the big blind (MiniMax-M2) has 311 chips.\n\nLooking at the opponent data: MiniMax-M2 seems to be playing fairly straightforwardly. From the recent hands:\n- In hand #21, they raised preflop (8 chips, then 48 chips - looks like a 3-bet situation)\n- They frequently call from the BB (hands 15, 16, 19, 20)\n- They tend to bet on the turn when they have initiative\n\nMy hand: KTo suited is a decent button hand. It's not premium, but it's playable from the button. With only the BB left to act, I have position advantage.\n\nPosition considerations: I'm on the button, which is the best position. I can see how the BB reacts postflop.\n\nStack sizes: I have 46.8 BB, which is healthy but not huge. The BB has more chips (311 vs my 187).\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win a pot of 8 chips (6 already in pot + 2 from me). That's 4:1 pot odds, which is excellent.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: Not great given the excellent pot odds and position.\n2. Call: Complete the small blind. This is reasonable - see a flop cheaply with position.\n3. Raise: Standard button raise could be 3-4x BB (12-16 chips). This takes initiative and may win the pot preflop.\n\nGiven the opponent tends to call from BB frequently, a raise might get called. But with KTo, I'd rather see a flop cheaply or take it down preflop. A raise to 12-16 chips (3-4x) is standard.\n\nTournament considerations: I want to accumulate chips but also preserve my stack. With 46.8 BB, I have room to maneuver.\n\nDecision: I'll raise to take initiative and potentially win the pot preflop. A standard 3x raise to 12 total (8 more) seems good."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm on the button with Ks Th. The small blind is 2, big blind is 4. I've already posted the small blind of 2, so I need to call 2 more to match the big blind. My stack is 187 chips (46.8 BB). The player in the big blind (MiniMax-M2) has 311 chips.\n\nLooking at the opponent data: MiniMax-M2 seems to be playing fairly straightforwardly. From the recent hands:\n- In hand #21, they raised preflop (8 chips, then 48 chips - looks like a 3-bet situation)\n- They frequently call from the BB (hands 15, 16, 19, 20)\n- They tend to bet on the turn when they have initiative\n\nMy hand: KTo suited is a decent button hand. It's not premium, but it's playable from the button. With only the BB left to act, I have position advantage.\n\nPosition considerations: I'm on the button, which is the best position. I can see how the BB reacts postflop.\n\nStack sizes: I have 46.8 BB, which is healthy but not huge. The BB has more chips (311 vs my 187).\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win a pot of 8 chips (6 already in pot + 2 from me). That's 4:1 pot odds, which is excellent.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: Not great given the excellent pot odds and position.\n2. Call: Complete the small blind. This is reasonable - see a flop cheaply with position.\n3. Raise: Standard button raise could be 3-4x BB (12-16 chips). This takes initiative and may win the pot preflop.\n\nGiven the opponent tends to call from BB frequently, a raise might get called. But with KTo, I'd rather see a flop cheaply or take it down preflop. A raise to 12-16 chips (3-4x) is standard.\n\nTournament considerations: I want to accumulate chips but also preserve my stack. With 46.8 BB, I have room to maneuver.\n\nDecision: I'll raise to take initiative and potentially win the pot preflop. A standard 3x raise to 12 total (8 more) seems good.",

I've already posted SB 2, need to call 2 more. Pot is 6, I have 187 chips (46.8 BB). BB has 311. Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nI analyzed: KTo suited is decent on button. Excellent pot odds (4:1). Position advantage. Opponent in BB tends to call frequently. Options: fold (bad odds), call (see flop cheap), raise (take initiative).\n\nI think raising is best. Standard 3x raise to 12 total (8 more). Minimum raise to is 8, so 12 is valid (3x BB). That's a raise of 10 more from current 2? Wait: I've already put in 2 as SB. Amount to call is 2. Minimum raise to is 8 total. So if I raise to 12 total, that means I put in 12 total, which is 10 more than my current 2. That's valid.\n\nSo action: raise, raise_to: 12.

In hand #19, they called flop bet of 12, then bet 24 on turn\n2. In hand #20, they called multiple streets, then bet on turn\n3. In hand #21, they raised preflop (8 then 48), then bet 40 on flop, 40 on turn\n4. Showdown hands show they played 9d Ts and 4d 8c\n\n**Current Situation:**\nI raised preflop from BTN to 12, opponent called from BB. Flop came Ad 9h 2d. I checked, opponent bet 12 into 36 pot (1/3 pot bet).\n\n**My Hand Strength:**\n- I have middle pair with Ten (pair of 9s on board)\n- Backdoor straight draw (QJ would give me straight)\n- Backdoor flush draw (if diamonds come)\n- King kicker might be good if opponent has weaker pair\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 36, bet is 12, so total pot would be 48 if I call\n- I need 12 to win 48, giving me 25% pot odds\n- I have roughly 5 outs (two tens, three kings) = ~20% equity\n- Plus backdoor straight and flush draws add maybe 4-5% more\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 177 chips (44.2 BB), opponent has 291 chips\n- This is a small bet (1/3 pot), could be a probe bet with weak hand\n- Opponent in BB could have called with wide range\n\n**Decision:**\nThe pot odds (25%) are close to my estimated equity (~24-25% with draws). However, I have position and can see turn card. The small bet size suggests weakness - could be testing or betting with weaker pair. Given my position and the small bet size, I should call to see turn.\n\nIf I hit a King or Ten on turn, I could take the pot. If I miss, I can reevaluate. Folding seems too tight given the small bet and my position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Calling small 1/3 pot bet with middle pair and backdoor draws.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current hand. I'm on the turn with Ks Th, board is Ad 9h 2d Ts. I have middle pair with Ten kicker. I raised preflop from BTN, MiniMax-M2 called from BB. I checked flop, they bet 12 into 24, I called. Now on turn, amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's tendencies from the search results:\n- They tend to bet on turns when they have initiative (hands 15, 16, 19, 20, 21)\n- In hand 19, they bet turn after calling flop bet with 66 on 22h2c4h board\n- In hand 20, they bet turn after calling flop bet with K4 on 5s6s9d board\n- They seem to be aggressive post-flop, especially on turns\n\nMy hand: I have middle pair (Tens) with King kicker. Board has Ad 9h 2d Ts. I have second pair. There's a flush draw (diamonds) and straight draws possible (KQ, QJ, J8). My kicker is decent (King).\n\nPot is 48 chips. My stack is 165. MiniMax-M2 has 291. If I check, they might bet again. If they bet small, I might have to call given pot odds. But my hand is vulnerable - any King, Queen, Jack, or diamond could beat me or improve draws.\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2's aggressive tendencies on turns, checking might invite a bet that puts me in a tough spot. However, raising could be risky since they called my preflop raise and bet flop - they likely have at least something like a weak Ace, a pair, or a draw.\n\nI should check to see what they do. If they check back, I get a free river. If they bet small, I can call with my pair. If they bet big, I might need to fold.\n\nActually, looking at hand 19: I had 66, raised preflop, bet flop, they called, then they bet turn and I folded. Similar situation - I had an underpair to the board. Now I have middle pair. But they showed aggression on turn in that hand too.\n\nI think checking is best here. My hand is marginal - not strong enough to value bet, not weak enough to fold. Checking allows me to control the pot size and see what they do.\n\nWait, I have position (BTN) and it's checked to me. Actually no, I'm first to act on the turn because I called flop bet. So I'm first to act. I should check.\n\nLet me check the action sequence: I'm Seat 3 (BTN). On flop, I checked, they bet, I called. Now on turn, I act first. So I should check.\n\nIf I check and they bet, I'll have to decide. But for now, check.",

The board shows Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h - so there's an ace, nine, two, ten, two. The turn was a ten, giving me a pair of tens. The river brought a 2h, making the board Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h. So now there's a pair of twos on board.\n\nPot is 48 chips. My stack is 165 chips. Opponent (Seat 4: MiniMax-M2) has 291 chips. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nI need to think about hand strength: I have Ks Th, board is Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h. My hand: pair of tens with king kicker. The board has Ad (ace), so opponent could have an ace. Also possible flush draws missed (diamonds didn't come), but there's no flush possible since only two diamonds. Straight draws: nothing really connects except maybe QJ for straight, but board has Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h, so straight would need KQJ or something, but that's unlikely.\n\nThe river paired the twos, making board Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h. So now there are two pair on board: twos and tens? Actually board has two twos and one ten. So my hand is tens with king kicker, but board has pair of twos which could give someone a full house if they have a two. But a two is unlikely since I raised preflop and opponent called.\n\nLet me think about preflop action: I raised from SB to 12 (3x BB), opponent in BB called. So my range as SB raiser could be wide. Opponent's calling range from BB could also be wide.\n\nFlop: Ad 9h 2d. I checked, opponent bet 12 into pot of 24? Let's calculate: preflop pot was my 12 + opponent's 12 = 24, plus blinds 2+4 = 6? Wait, SB posted 2, BB posted 4, I raised to 12 total (so additional 10), opponent called additional 8. So pot preflop: SB 2 + BB 4 + my raise 12 + opponent call 8 = 26? Actually let's recalc: I'm seat 3 (SB). I posted SB 2, then raised to 12 total. That means I put in additional 10. Opponent (BB) posted BB 4, then called my raise of 12, meaning he put in additional 8. So total pot preflop: 2 (my SB) + 4 (BB) + 10 (my additional) + 8 (opponent additional) = 24. Yes.\n\nFlop: I check, opponent bets 12 into 24, half pot. I call with my pair of tens (ten on turn? Wait, turn was the Ts. Actually flop was Ad 9h 2d. I called with gutshot? I have Ks Th, so on flop Ad 9h 2d, I have backdoor straight draw, backdoor flush draw (hearts?), but my Th is hearts? Actually my Th is ten of hearts. So I have one heart. Board has 9h (heart), 2h (heart on river). So backdoor flush draw possible. But mostly I called with overcard and backdoors.\n\nTurn: Ts. Board now Ad 9h 2d Ts. I check, opponent checks. So opponent didn't continue betting on turn after I called flop. That suggests weakness. Maybe opponent had a draw or weak ace.\n\nRiver: 2h. Board now Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h. I have Ks Th, so pair of tens with king kicker. Board has pair of twos. So my hand is essentially two pair: tens and twos, but the twos are on board, so anyone with a ten has same two pair. Anyone with an ace has two pair aces and twos. Anyone with a two has full house.\n\nGiven opponent checked turn, they likely don't have a strong hand. Could be a weak ace like A8, A7, maybe a draw that missed. Could also have a nine or pocket pair like 88, 77.\n\nI need to decide whether to bet for value or check. I have second pair, but might be best hand. Pot is 48 chips. I could bet small for value, maybe 1/3 pot (16 chips) or half pot (24). Or check"

          "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this situation. I'm on the river with Ks Th, board is Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h. I have a pair of tens with king kicker. The board shows Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h, so there's an ace, nine, two of diamonds, ten of spades, and two of hearts. The river paired the twos.\n\nLooking at the action: preflop I raised from SB to 12, opponent called. Flop Ad 9h 2d: I checked, opponent bet 12 (half pot), I called. Turn Ts: I checked, opponent checked. River 2h: now action to me.\n\nOpponent's flop bet could be a continuation bet with any two cards, or value with an ace. But then they checked turn when the ten came. The ten is a scare card because it completes some straight draws (QJ would have straight), but more importantly, it gives me a pair if I was floating. So opponent's check on turn suggests weakness - likely doesn't have a strong ace, maybe a weak ace or a draw.\n\nNow river brings a 2h, pairing the board. This is a brick for most draws. Diamonds didn't come for flush, straight draws missed. So opponent likely has a weak hand.\n\nMy hand is medium strength - pair of tens with king kicker. I beat all bluffs, weak aces with worse kicker (like A8, A7, A6, A5, A4, A3), any pair lower than tens, and any missed draws. I lose to any ace with better kicker (AJ, AQ, AK), any two pair (A9, A2, 92), any set (99, 22, AA), and any full house (22, TT, 99, AA).\n\nGiven opponent's turn check, they're unlikely to have a strong hand. They might call a small value bet with a weak ace or middle pair. I should bet for value. Pot is 48 chips. A bet of 16-24 chips (1/3 to 1/2 pot) seems reasonable. If I bet and get raised, I can fold.\n\nMy stack is 165 chips (41 BB), opponent has 291. Tournament considerations: I'm below average stack (average would be around 200-250? 5 players, total chips ~946, average ~189). So I'm slightly below average. Building chips is important.\n\nI should bet for thin value. Let's say 1/3 pot = 16 chips. Or 1/2 pot = 24 chips. I'll go with 20 chips (a bit less than half pot).\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. I want to raise (bet) since amount to call is 0. Minimum raise to is 12, but I can bet any amount above that. I'll bet 20.\n\nReasoning: Opponent showed weakness by checking turn, likely has weak ace or middle pair that will call small bet. My pair of tens with king kicker has good showdown value but can extract value from weaker hands. Betting also protects against opponent bluffing river if I check.\n\nJSON response.",

Actually it's Kh 4s, so not suited. This is a very marginal hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position. However, with only 2 players left to act (SB and BB), and the SB (MiniMax-M2) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B) are yet to act.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 213 chips (53.2 BB), which is healthy. MiniMax-M2 has 289 chips (72.25 BB), GPT-OSS-120B has 204 chips (51 BB).\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB): From the data, seems to be active. In hand #21, they made a preflop raise to 8, then re-raised to 48. In hand #22, they called a raise preflop. Seems capable of aggressive play.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has folded several hands preflop (hands 17-19, 22). Only raised once (hand #20 from BB position with just 4 chips which was actually just completing?). Actually looking at hand #20: they raised to 4 from BB when facing no raise? That might have been just checking? Actually \"raise\" to 4 from BB when BB is already 4 suggests they just checked. They seem relatively tight.\n\n5. **Current situation**: Everyone has folded to me on the Button. I can open-raise, call the BB, or fold.\n\n6. **Hand analysis**: Kh4o is a weak hand. Generally not recommended to open with this from any position, but being on the Button against just SB and BB, it's borderline. The problem is that if I raise, I'm likely to get called or re-raised by SB who seems aggressive. If I just call (limp), that's generally bad poker strategy as it invites the blinds to see a cheap flop with any two cards.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: I have 53 BB, which is a decent stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands.\n\n8. **Alternative considerations**: Some aggressive players might open-raise with any two cards on the Button, but Kh4o is particularly weak because it has poor playability postflop. The king is good but the 4 kicker is terrible.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best play is to **fold**. The hand is too weak to open-raise, and limping is bad strategy. I should wait for a better spot, especially since I have a healthy stack.\n\nLet me check if there are any other relevant observations about button opens."

UTG is the earliest position, meaning I have to act first preflop with 5 players still to act behind me (SB, BB, and 2 others). With 53.2 BB stack, I'm not desperate for chips.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot (16 folds out of 23 hands), which is reasonable. I won hand #22 with Ks Th from SB position, but that's a much better hand than 4c Td.\n\nThe opponents: MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 has shown aggressive tendencies with raises preflop (hand #21, #23). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is in BB, seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is SB.\n\nWith 4c Td offsuit, this is a trash hand that should almost always be folded from UTG. There's very little potential to make a strong hand postflop. Even if I hit a pair, it's likely dominated. The hand has poor connectivity and no suitedness.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 4 chips into pot of 6 (total pot would be 10 if I call). That's 2.5:1 odds, but with such a weak hand and poor position, the implied odds are terrible.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 53.2 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands from early position.\n\nGiven that I'm first to act, if I call, I'll likely face raises from later positions (especially MiniMax-M2 who has been aggressive). Better to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"4c Td is a very weak hand from UTG position with 5 players left to act. Poor hand strength, terrible position, and aggressive opponents behind make this an easy fold. With 53.2 BB stack, better to preserve chips for stronger spots.\"\n}",

We have 209 chips (52.2 BB), so we're reasonably deep.\n\nThe action: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8 (2BB), then Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) 3-bet to 24 (6BB). We need to call 20 chips to continue.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been folding a lot recently (folds in last 4 hands). This 3-bet after a raise suggests a strong hand, possibly premium.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been raising frequently (raises in hands 21, 23, 24) and showed aggression. In hand 21, they made a big 4-bet preflop (from 8 to 48), showing they're willing to play aggressively.\n\nThe pot is currently 38 chips (our 4 BB + 2 SB + 8 raise + 24 3-bet). We need to call 20 to win 58 (38 + our 20 call). That's about 2.9:1 pot odds.\n\nHowever, K4o is a terrible hand to call a 3-bet with, especially out of position. We'll be in the small blind, which means we'll act first on every street postflop. This is a huge disadvantage.\n\nAdditionally, Seat 4 still has to act after us. They could 4-bet, which would put us in an even worse spot. Even if they just call, we'll be facing a 3-way pot with a weak hand out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: We have 52 BB, which is healthy. No need to gamble with K4o against what looks like strong ranges.\n\nMy analysis:\n1. Hand strength: Very weak - K4o has poor playability, low equity against 3-bet ranges\n2. Position: Terrible (SB, out of position)\n3. Opponent tendencies: Both showing strength\n4. Pot odds: Decent (2.9:1) but not enough given hand weakness and positional disadvantage\n5. Tournament: Preserving stack is important\n\nThis is an easy fold. We should wait for better spots."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nWe're in the small blind with Ks 4c, which is a weak hand - King-rag offsuit. We have 209 chips (52.2 BB), so we're reasonably deep.\n\nThe action: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8 (2BB), then Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) 3-bet to 24 (6BB). We need to call 20 chips to continue.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been folding a lot recently (folds in last 4 hands). This 3-bet after a raise suggests a strong hand, possibly premium.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been raising frequently (raises in hands 21, 23, 24) and showed aggression. In hand 21, they made a big 4-bet preflop (from 8 to 48), showing they're willing to play aggressively.\n\nThe pot is currently 38 chips (our 4 BB + 2 SB + 8 raise + 24 3-bet). We need to call 20 to win 58 (38 + our 20 call). That's about 2.9:1 pot odds.\n\nHowever, K4o is a terrible hand to call a 3-bet with, especially out of position. We'll be in the small blind, which means we'll act first on every street postflop. This is a huge disadvantage.\n\nAdditionally, Seat 4 still has to act after us. They could 4-bet, which would put us in an even worse spot. Even if they just call, we'll be facing a 3-way pot with a weak hand out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: We have 52 BB, which is healthy. No need to gamble with K4o against what looks like strong ranges.\n\nMy analysis:\n1. Hand strength: Very weak - K4o has poor playability, low equity against 3-bet ranges\n2. Position: Terrible (SB, out of position)\n3. Opponent tendencies: Both showing strength\n4. Pot odds: Decent (2.9:1) but not enough given hand weakness and positional disadvantage\n5. Tournament: Preserving stack is important\n\nThis is an easy fold. We should wait for better spots.",

I have to call 2 chips to complete the small blind, with the big blind already posted. The pot is 6 chips (2 from my SB, 4 from BB).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been raising preflop frequently - they raised in hands 23, 24, and 25. In hand 25, they raised to 8 then called a re-raise to 16. They seem aggressive preflop.\n\nHowever, I have position on them (I'm BTN, they're in SB next hand). But my hand is just so weak. 36o has almost no playability postflop. Even with position, this hand will rarely hit a flop well, and when it does, it's usually weak pairs or weak draws.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 to win 6, so I'm getting 3:1 odds. That's decent, but implied odds are poor because when I do hit something like a pair of 3s or 6s, it's vulnerable and won't win big pots. Reverse implied odds are bad - I could hit a pair and lose to better pairs.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take marginal spots with trash hands. Folding costs me only 2 chips (my SB), which is negligible.\n\nMy position is good (button), but the hand is just too weak to play. Even if I complete and see a flop, I'll often have to fold to any aggression.\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 has been raising frequently, if I call, they might raise behind me, putting me in a tough spot.\n\nBetter to just fold this trash hand and wait for a better spot.

I have pocket aces.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is a great position to play from, especially with a strong hand.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. Opponents have similar stacks (253 and 252 chips).\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown aggressive preflop tendencies, raising to 8 chips in hands 23, 24, and 25. In hand 25, they called a re-raise to 16. They seem somewhat loose-aggressive.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded preflop (hands 21-24, 26), but made a big raise to 24 in hand 25. They showed Ad Ts in hand 25, so they can play speculative hands.\n\n5. **Current situation**: I'm on the button with 4 chips to call. There's 6 chips in the pot (SB + BB). Seat 1 folded, so it's just me to act against SB (Seat 4) and BB (Seat 5).\n\nWith pocket aces, I definitely want to build the pot. The standard play would be to raise. Since I'm on the button and both blinds are still in, I should make a substantial raise to isolate and build the pot.\n\nLooking at the minimum raise to: 8, which is just a min-raise. That's probably too small. I should raise to something like 12-16 chips to build a pot and discourage speculative calls.\n\nGiven that Seat 4 has been raising to 8 preflop, and Seat 5 raised to 24 in one hand, I think a raise to 16-20 would be appropriate. This builds the pot while still allowing me to potentially get action.\n\nI'll raise to 16 chips (4x the BB). This is a strong but not overly aggressive raise that should get respect and potentially get calls from the blinds.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 16,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket aces on the button - premium hand that should be raised aggressively.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI have Ad Ah (pocket aces) on the BTN with 191 chips (47.8 BB). I raised to 16 (4x BB). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) in the SB 3-bet to 28 total (7x BB). BB folded.\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: I see from hand #21 they raised to 8, then re-raised to 48 (a massive 4-bet). From hands #23-25, they raised to 8 (standard 2x BB raise) multiple times. In hand #25, they called a 3-bet with Jh Kh.\n\nNow I need to decide: fold, call 12 more, or raise. With pocket aces, I should definitely not fold. Calling is an option, but raising is better to build the pot and get value. The pot is currently 48 (my 16 + their 28 + blinds 4). I need to call 12 more to make it 40 total.\n\nIf I raise, minimum raise to 40 total. That would be raising 24 more (from my current 16 to 40). Or I could raise more.\n\nMy stack is 191, opponent has 227. This is a tournament situation. With pocket aces, I want to get as many chips in preflop as possible. The opponent has shown aggression with re-raises (hand #21 they 4-bet to 48). They might have a strong hand but not necessarily as strong as AA.\n\nI should 4-bet. Let me calculate: if I raise to say 60-80, that would be a significant portion of my stack. Actually, let me think: minimum raise to 40 is small - only 24 more from my 16. That seems too small. I could raise to 80-100, which would be committing a good portion of my stack.\n\nGiven tournament dynamics and my premium hand, I should make a substantial 4-bet. Let's say raise to 80 total (putting in 64 more). That's a 4-bet to 20x BB. If they 5-bet shove, I'm calling with AA.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: I have 191, opponent has 227. If I raise to 80, I'd have 111 left behind. The pot would be 80 + 28 + 4 = 112. So I'd have roughly pot-sized bet left. That sets up a potential shove on flop.\n\nBetter to raise larger to commit more chips preflop. Maybe raise to 100? That would leave me 91 behind. Actually, with AA, I could even consider shoving all-in preflop given stack sizes (191 total, 47.8 BB). But that might scare them off.\n\nLet me check if they've shown willingness to call big bets preflop. In hand #21, they 4-bet to 48 (12x BB). In hand #25, they called a 3-bet with Jh Kh.\n\nI think a raise to 80-100 is good. Let's go with 100 total (raising 84 more from my current 16). That's a strong 4-bet.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 100,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket aces premium hand. Opponent has shown aggression with re-raises (hand #21 4-bet to 48). Making a strong 4-bet to 100 (25x BB) to build pot and commit chips with best hand. Sets up potential shove on flop with remaining 91 chips. Tournament chip accumulation opportunity with AA.\"\n}",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My hand: Ts 5s (suited Ten-Five) - this is a very weak hand, especially from UTG (early position)\n- Position: UTG (worst position, have to act first postflop)\n- Stack: 239 chips (59.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the search results, I can see:\n1. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has been quite aggressive preflop, raising frequently (Hands 21, 23, 24, 25, 27)\n2. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) is in SB, will act after me\n3. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) is in BB, will act last preflop\n\n**Positional Considerations:**\n- I'm UTG, so I have 4 players left to act after me (SB, BB, and two others)\n- With such a weak hand, opening from UTG is very risky\n- If I limp (call), I invite others to raise behind me\n- If I raise, I'm bloating the pot with a weak hand out of position\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 59.8 BB, which is a good stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands\n- Ts5s has some speculative value (suited, can make flushes), but not enough to play from UTG\n\n**Previous UTG Plays:**\nLooking at my UTG history, I've folded every time from UTG so far (hands 8, 12, 16, 20, 24). This is generally correct strategy - play tight from early position.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Ts5s is well below UTG opening range\n- Even suited, it's still a weak hand\n- Position is terrible\n- Likely to face raises from aggressive players behind me (especially MiniMax-M2)\n- Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots\n\n**Conclusion:** Fold is the correct play. I should wait for a better hand in better position.",

Could be a steal attempt from SB.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 8 to win 16, so I'm getting 2:1 odds (33% equity needed).\n\n**Hand Strength:** K7s is a marginal hand. Suited King with a 7 kicker is not great, but suited gives some flush potential. Against a likely stealing range from SB, K7s has some value.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I have 58.8 BB, which is a healthy stack. Don't need to take big risks.\n\n**Decision:** With position and decent pot odds, calling seems reasonable. Folding is too tight against a likely steal. Raising seems aggressive with a marginal hand.

          "content": "Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with Kd7d. Preflop: SB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 12, I called 8 more (total 4 was already posted as BB). Pot was 42 (2+4+12+8+?). Actually let me calculate: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, SB raised 12 total (so additional 10), I called 8 more. That's 2+4+12+8 = 26. Wait, pot is 42 chips now. Maybe there's something else.\n\nFlop: 4c5d6s. This is a great flop for my hand! I have a flush draw (diamonds) and a straight draw. Actually, with Kd7d on 4c5d6s:\n- I have a gutshot straight draw to an 8 (would give me 4-5-6-7-8 straight)\n- I have a flush draw (backdoor flush draw? Wait, I have Kd7d, flop has 5d, so I have a flush draw with 2 diamonds in hand and 1 on board)\n- I have overcard potential with King high\n- I have backdoor straight potential\n\nThe board is 4-5-6 rainbow? Actually 4c5d6s - two different suits, diamond is one of them.\n\nOpponent bet 18 into 42 pot (about 43% pot bet). I need to call 18 to win pot of 42+18=60. That's pot odds of 18:60 or 30%. I need at least 30% equity to call.\n\nLet me estimate my equity against a typical SB raising range. SB raised preflop from small blind. My opponent \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\" has been folding a lot preflop (from the data: folded 6 of last 7 hands preflop). But this hand they raised preflop. So they likely have a stronger than average hand.\n\nMy hand has good equity against many hands: \n- Against overpairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT): I have flush draw + straight draw ~35-40% equity\n- Against top pair hands (like A4, A5, A6): similar equity\n- Against sets (44, 55, 66): I have ~25-30% equity\n- Against two pair (45, 46, 56): I have ~30-35% equity\n- Against straight draws (like 78): I'm behind but have flush redraw\n\nOverall I likely have 30-40% equity, which makes calling profitable given 30% pot odds.\n\nBut I should also consider raising. Raising could:\n1. Fold out some weaker hands\n2. Build pot for when I hit\n3. Take initiative\n\nHowever, raising with a draw might be risky since I'm out of position. Also, my stack is 227, pot is 42, bet is 18. If I raise to say 54 (minimum raise to 36 total? Wait, minimum raise to is 36, meaning I need to raise to at least 36 total. Actually opponent bet 18, so minimum raise is to 36 total (additional 18). But I could raise more.\n\nBut I'm deep stacked (56.8 BB) and opponent is also deep. Raising might commit me if opponent re-raises.\n\nGiven I'm out of position, calling might be better to see a turn card. Also, if I hit my draw on turn, I can potentially win a big pot.\n\nLet me check if opponent tends to continuation bet often. From the data, I only see one flop action from opponent (hand 21: check on flop). Not much data.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have average stack (227 vs blinds 2/4). No need to take huge risks.\n\nI think calling is reasonable. I have good equity, good pot odds, and position disadvantage. If turn bricks, I can re-evaluate.\n\nWait, I should also consider that I have position? Actually I'm BB, opponent is SB. After flop, action goes to me first? No, SB acted first on flop (bet 18). So I'm last to act on flop. That's good - I have position for the rest of the hand.\n\nActually let me check: SB is seat 1, I'm BB seat 3. After flop, SB bet first, now it's on me. So I have position for turn and river.\n\nThat makes calling even better - I have position advantage.\n\nI'll call."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with Kd7d. Preflop: SB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 12, I called 8 more (total 4 was already posted as BB). Pot was 42 (2+4+12+8+?). Actually let me calculate: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, SB raised 12 total (so additional 10), I called 8 more. That's 2+4+12+8 = 26. Wait, pot is 42 chips now. Maybe there's something else.\n\nFlop: 4c5d6s. This is a great flop for my hand! I have a flush draw (diamonds) and a straight draw. Actually, with Kd7d on 4c5d6s:\n- I have a gutshot straight draw to an 8 (would give me 4-5-6-7-8 straight)\n- I have a flush draw (backdoor flush draw? Wait, I have Kd7d, flop has 5d, so I have a flush draw with 2 diamonds in hand and 1 on board)\n- I have overcard potential with King high\n- I have backdoor straight potential\n\nThe board is 4-5-6 rainbow? Actually 4c5d6s - two different suits, diamond is one of them.\n\nOpponent bet 18 into 42 pot (about 43% pot bet). I need to call 18 to win pot of 42+18=60. That's pot odds of 18:60 or 30%. I need at least 30% equity to call.\n\nLet me estimate my equity against a typical SB raising range. SB raised preflop from small blind. My opponent \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\" has been folding a lot preflop (from the data: folded 6 of last 7 hands preflop). But this hand they raised preflop. So they likely have a stronger than average hand.\n\nMy hand has good equity against many hands: \n- Against overpairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT): I have flush draw + straight draw ~35-40% equity\n- Against top pair hands (like A4, A5, A6): similar equity\n- Against sets (44, 55, 66): I have ~25-30% equity\n- Against two pair (45, 46, 56): I have ~30-35% equity\n- Against straight draws (like 78): I'm behind but have flush redraw\n\nOverall I likely have 30-40% equity, which makes calling profitable given 30% pot odds.\n\nBut I should also consider raising. Raising could:\n1. Fold out some weaker hands\n2. Build pot for when I hit\n3. Take initiative\n\nHowever, raising with a draw might be risky since I'm out of position. Also, my stack is 227, pot is 42, bet is 18. If I raise to say 54 (minimum raise to 36 total? Wait, minimum raise to is 36, meaning I need to raise to at least 36 total. Actually opponent bet 18, so minimum raise is to 36 total (additional 18). But I could raise more.\n\nBut I'm deep stacked (56.8 BB) and opponent is also deep. Raising might commit me if opponent re-raises.\n\nGiven I'm out of position, calling might be better to see a turn card. Also, if I hit my draw on turn, I can potentially win a big pot.\n\nLet me check if opponent tends to continuation bet often. From the data, I only see one flop action from opponent (hand 21: check on flop). Not much data.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have average stack (227 vs blinds 2/4). No need to take huge risks.\n\nI think calling is reasonable. I have good equity, good pot odds, and position disadvantage. If turn bricks, I can re-evaluate.\n\nWait, I should also consider that I have position? Actually I'm BB, opponent is SB. After flop, action goes to me first? No, SB acted first on flop (bet 18). So I'm last to act on flop. That's good - I have position for the rest of the hand.\n\nActually let me check: SB is seat 1, I'm BB seat 3. After flop, SB bet first, now it's on me. So I have position for turn and river.\n\nThat makes calling even better - I have position advantage.\n\nI'll call.",

This could mean:\n1. They missed the flop and are giving up\n2. They have a weak hand and are checking to control pot\n3. They're setting up a check-raise (but I haven't seen this pattern from them)\n4. They have a draw and want a free card\n\nMy hand has improved to a pair of 7s. The board is draw-heavy with straight and flush possibilities. My King kicker is decent but not great.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card, see river, keep pot small\n2. **Bet**: Try to take down the pot now, charge draws\n\n**Considerations:**\n- I'm out of position, which makes playing the river tricky\n- The pot is 60 chips, I have 209 behind\n- If I bet and get called or raised, I'll be in a tough spot on river\n- My hand is vulnerable to many rivers (any 8, 3, spade, higher card)\n\nGiven the opponent's check and my positional disadvantage, I think checking is reasonable. I can re-evaluate on the river. If the opponent bets river, I'll need to decide if my pair of 7s is good.\n\nI'll check and see what happens on the river."

This could mean:\n1. They missed the flop and are giving up\n2. They have a weak hand and are checking to control pot\n3. They're setting up a check-raise (but I haven't seen this pattern from them)\n4. They have a draw and want a free card\n\nMy hand has improved to a pair of 7s. The board is draw-heavy with straight and flush possibilities. My King kicker is decent but not great.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card, see river, keep pot small\n2. **Bet**: Try to take down the pot now, charge draws\n\n**Considerations:**\n- I'm out of position, which makes playing the river tricky\n- The pot is 60 chips, I have 209 behind\n- If I bet and get called or raised, I'll be in a tough spot on river\n- My hand is vulnerable to many rivers (any 8, 3, spade, higher card)\n\nGiven the opponent's check and my positional disadvantage, I think checking is reasonable. I can re-evaluate on the river. If the opponent bets river, I'll need to decide if my pair of 7s is good.\n\nI'll check and see what happens on the river.",

My hand is marginal (middle pair on wet board)\n2. Opponent showed weakness by checking river\n3. Pot is relatively small (60 chips)\n4. I could be beaten by many hands (any J, 8, 9, T, flush, straight)\n5. Checking allows me to see showdown without risking more chips\n\nI think checking is the prudent play. If I bet and get raised, I'd likely have to fold. A bet might get called by better hands and fold out worse hands. Checking allows me to potentially win if opponent has missed draws.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Middle pair on wet board with many better hands possible.

          "content": "I need to analyze this situation:\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN with 4h6h. The action: UTG (Seat 1) folded, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 12 total (3x BB). I have to call 10 more to a pot of 18.\n\n**Hand strength:** 64s is a speculative hand. Suited connectors can play well multiway but I'm heads-up against a raiser. This is a weak hand preflop.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), opponent has 238 chips. We're both deep stacked.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** From the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop in 3 hands: \n- Hand 13: raised to 30 (7.5x BB)\n- Hand 20: raised to 4 (just the BB - likely a misclick or special situation)\n- Hand 25: raised to 24 (6x BB)\n\nLooks like they raise aggressively preflop, often with large sizing (6-7.5x BB). The current raise is 12 (3x BB), which is smaller than their typical raises.\n\n**Position:** Being on the BTN is advantageous, but I'm out of position against the raiser who is in MP/CO? Actually, Seat 5 is likely UTG+1 or MP? Let me check: Seat 1 folded (UTG), I'm BTN (Seat 3), Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB? Wait no - looking at actions: Seat 3 (me) posted SB 2, Seat 4 posted BB 4, Seat 5 raised 12. So Seat 5 is UTG? Actually if I'm BTN, then Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB. But the action says Seat 5 raised after posting BB? That doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 2\" (me), \"preflop: Seat 4 post_bb 4\", \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 12\". So Seat 5 is UTG (first to act after blinds). So they're raising from UTG position.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 18 (2+4+12), I need to call 10. That's 1.8:1 pot odds, or needing ~35.7% equity. 64s vs a UTG raising range has maybe 30-35% equity at best. Not great.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 51.8 BB, which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots with weak hands.\n\n**My history:** From my hands, I've been aggressive on BTN with good hands (KK, AA, KTs). I folded weak hands like 27o, K4o. 64s is borderline but probably too weak against a UTG raise.\n\n**Decision:** I should fold. While suited connectors can be playable, facing a UTG raise from a player who seems to raise aggressively, and being out of position postflop (they act after me on flop/turn/river since they're UTG and I'm BTN? Actually no - if they're UTG and I'm BTN, I have position on them. Wait, position order: UTG (Seat 5) acts first, then folds, then me (BTN), then SB, then BB. Actually if Seat 5 is UTG, they act first preflop, but postflop the action goes: SB, BB, UTG, BTN? Let me think: Blinds are Seat 3 (SB) and Seat 4 (BB). Seat 5 is UTG. Postflop, action starts with SB (Seat 3 - me), then BB (Seat 4), then UTG (Seat 5). So I would be out of position against the raiser! They act after me. That's bad.\n\nActually no, I'm confused. Let me reconstruct: Seat numbers: 1, 2, 3(me), 4, 5. I'm Seat 3 (BTN). Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB. But the action says Seat 5 raised after posting BB? That can't be right. Unless the hand is mislabeled? Actually \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 12\" - if Seat 5 is BB, they would have already posted 4. Raising to 12 means putting 8 more. That makes sense. So Seat 5 is BB raising after posting blind. So they're in BB position, not UTG.\n\nSo position: BB raised, I'm BTN. I have position on the raiser! That's good. But still, facing a"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation:\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN with 4h6h. The action: UTG (Seat 1) folded, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 12 total (3x BB). I have to call 10 more to a pot of 18.\n\n**Hand strength:** 64s is a speculative hand. Suited connectors can play well multiway but I'm heads-up against a raiser. This is a weak hand preflop.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), opponent has 238 chips. We're both deep stacked.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** From the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop in 3 hands: \n- Hand 13: raised to 30 (7.5x BB)\n- Hand 20: raised to 4 (just the BB - likely a misclick or special situation)\n- Hand 25: raised to 24 (6x BB)\n\nLooks like they raise aggressively preflop, often with large sizing (6-7.5x BB). The current raise is 12 (3x BB), which is smaller than their typical raises.\n\n**Position:** Being on the BTN is advantageous, but I'm out of position against the raiser who is in MP/CO? Actually, Seat 5 is likely UTG+1 or MP? Let me check: Seat 1 folded (UTG), I'm BTN (Seat 3), Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB? Wait no - looking at actions: Seat 3 (me) posted SB 2, Seat 4 posted BB 4, Seat 5 raised 12. So Seat 5 is UTG? Actually if I'm BTN, then Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB. But the action says Seat 5 raised after posting BB? That doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 2\" (me), \"preflop: Seat 4 post_bb 4\", \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 12\". So Seat 5 is UTG (first to act after blinds). So they're raising from UTG position.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 18 (2+4+12), I need to call 10. That's 1.8:1 pot odds, or needing ~35.7% equity. 64s vs a UTG raising range has maybe 30-35% equity at best. Not great.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 51.8 BB, which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots with weak hands.\n\n**My history:** From my hands, I've been aggressive on BTN with good hands (KK, AA, KTs). I folded weak hands like 27o, K4o. 64s is borderline but probably too weak against a UTG raise.\n\n**Decision:** I should fold. While suited connectors can be playable, facing a UTG raise from a player who seems to raise aggressively, and being out of position postflop (they act after me on flop/turn/river since they're UTG and I'm BTN? Actually no - if they're UTG and I'm BTN, I have position on them. Wait, position order: UTG (Seat 5) acts first, then folds, then me (BTN), then SB, then BB. Actually if Seat 5 is UTG, they act first preflop, but postflop the action goes: SB, BB, UTG, BTN? Let me think: Blinds are Seat 3 (SB) and Seat 4 (BB). Seat 5 is UTG. Postflop, action starts with SB (Seat 3 - me), then BB (Seat 4), then UTG (Seat 5). So I would be out of position against the raiser! They act after me. That's bad.\n\nActually no, I'm confused. Let me reconstruct: Seat numbers: 1, 2, 3(me), 4, 5. I'm Seat 3 (BTN). Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB. But the action says Seat 5 raised after posting BB? That can't be right. Unless the hand is mislabeled? Actually \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 12\" - if Seat 5 is BB, they would have already posted 4. Raising to 12 means putting 8 more. That makes sense. So Seat 5 is BB raising after posting blind. So they're in BB position, not UTG.\n\nSo position: BB raised, I'm BTN. I have position on the raiser! That's good. But still, facing a",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation properly. I'm on the BTN with 4h6h. The BB (Seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 12 total (3x BB). I need to call 10 more.\n\nFrom the opponent actions, GPT-OSS-120B has raised twice:\n- Hand 20: raised to 4 (just the BB amount, which seems like a misclick or special situation)\n- Hand 25: raised to 24 (6x BB)\n\nSo they've shown some aggression but not excessive. The current raise of 12 (3x BB) is more standard.\n\nMy hand: 64s is a speculative hand. As suited connectors, they play well in position with deep stacks. I have position on the raiser (I'm BTN, they're BB, so I act after them postflop). That's a big advantage.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 18, I need to call 10. That's 1.8:1, needing ~35.7% equity. Against a typical BB raising range (which might be wider since they're defending their blind), 64s likely has around 35-40% equity. So pot odds are borderline.\n\nStack sizes: I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), opponent has 238. We're both deep, which makes speculative hands more playable.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, no need to take big risks. But playing suited connectors in position with deep stacks can be profitable.\n\nMy own history: I've been folding weak hands, playing aggressively with premiums. I should be selective but not too tight.\n\nThe BB raised, which could be a steal attempt. They might have a wider range. Being in position with a suited connector is reasonable.\n\nHowever, 64s is one of the weakest suited connectors. The gap between 4 and 6 is small, but it's still low cards. I could consider calling to see a flop and potentially win a big pot if I hit a strong draw or two pair. But I need to be prepared to fold if I miss.\n\nLet me check if there are any other players left to act: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is SB and hasn't acted yet. They still need to act after me. So there's risk of a squeeze.\n\nActually, wait: The action order: I'm BTN, SB and BB already posted. BB raised. UTG (Seat 1) folded. Now it's on me (BTN). Then SB (Seat 4) acts, then back to BB if there's a raise. So SB could still raise.\n\nGiven all this, I think folding is prudent. 64s is too weak even in position against a raise. The pot odds aren't compelling enough, and there's still SB left to act who could squeeze. I should wait for better spots.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"64s is too weak against a BB raise, even with position.

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 2, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted BB 4, and Seat 1 folded. So it's folded to me on the button with just the blinds remaining.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from the search:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB) seems somewhat aggressive but also capable of folding. In hand 27, they folded to a big 3-bet when they had raised preflop.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB) has shown some aggression, raising from SB in hand 30 with 4h6h, and 3-betting preflop in hand 25.\n\nMy position is excellent - button. With both players having posted blinds, I could consider a steal attempt. However, 43s is extremely weak. Even for a button steal, this is near the bottom of my range.\n\nMy stack is 51.8 BB - healthy but not huge. If I raise and get called or 3-bet, I'll be playing a very weak hand out of position postflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6 (pot is 6). That's 1.5:1 odds, but the hand is so weak that these odds don't justify playing.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack and should preserve it. Getting involved with 43s could lead to difficult postflop situations.\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger hand. The blinds are small relative to my stack, so I can afford to be patient.\n\nDecision: Fold. This hand is too weak even for a button steal against opponents who have shown some aggression.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this situation. I'm in the BB with 5h 8s, a very weak hand. The SB just completed to 4 chips (called the BB). The pot is 8 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 2 call). I have 203 chips (50.8 BB). Opponent has 300 chips.\n\nLooking at opponent actions: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot recently (last 3 hands folded preflop). They raised to 12 in hand 29 and 28 in hand 21. They completed the SB here instead of raising, which suggests a weak hand.\n\nMy hand 5h 8s is terrible - unsuited, low cards, no straight potential. However, I'm getting to see a free flop from the BB since amount to call is 0. I could check and see a flop, or I could raise to try to take the pot down preflop.\n\nFactors:\n1. Hand strength: Very weak\n2. Position: BB - out of position postflop\n3. Stack sizes: I have 50.8 BB, opponent has 75 BB\n4. Opponent tendency: Recently folding a lot, completed SB rather than raising\n5. Pot odds: Free to check\n\nIf I raise, I'd need to make it at least 8 chips total (minimum raise). That's 4 more chips to raise from 4 to 8. The pot would be 12 chips (8 + my 4 extra). If opponent folds, I win 8 chips. If they call, I'm playing a weak hand out of position.\n\nGiven my terrible hand and being out of position, checking seems best. I get to see a flop for free. 5-8 offsuit has some very limited potential (could make a straight, but unlikely). The risk of raising with such a weak hand outweighs the potential reward.\n\nAlso, in tournament poker, preserving stack is important. No need to get involved with 5-8o out of position.\n\nI should check and see a flop. If the flop hits me somehow (two pair, straight draw), I can proceed cautiously. Otherwise, I can fold.\n\nLet me check.",

They have nothing and want to give up\n  2. They have a weak hand and want to see a free card\n  3. They're trapping with a strong hand (set, two pair, etc.)\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 50.8 BB - healthy stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands\n- Pot is small (8 chips)\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that:\n1. My hand is very weak (bottom pair, weak kicker)\n2. I'm out of position\n3. Board has high cards that likely hit opponent's range\n4. Pot is small\n5. I have a healthy stack\n\nThe best play is to check and see the turn for free. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called or raised by better hands. If opponent has nothing, they'll fold to a bet, but the pot is too small to justify bluffing with such a weak hand.\n\nI should check and hope to improve on the turn, but be prepared to fold if opponent bets.",

They limped preflop (just called the SB to BB), which suggests a weak to medium hand. From the opponent action history, I see they've been folding a lot preflop (hands 25-27, 30-32), but in hand 29 they raised preflop to 12, bet 18 on flop, then checked turn and river with 99 on a 4c 5d 6s 7s Jh board. That shows some aggression when they have a decent hand.\n\nCurrent situation: I have bottom pair with 8 kicker. The board has A and K high, which are both higher than my pair. The opponent could be checking with a weak Ace, King, or a draw. They might also have a medium pocket pair (like 66-TT) that's afraid of the A and K on board.\n\nGiven the small pot (8 chips) and my weak hand, I should probably check back and see a free river. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands (any Ace, King, better pair, or draws that have equity against me). My hand has very little value and minimal bluffing potential since I'm out of position.\n\nThe tournament context: I have 50.8 BB, which is healthy but not huge. No need to take unnecessary risks with a marginal hand in a small pot.\n\nHowever, I could consider a small bet for protection against draws (there's a flush draw with two spades on board: As and Ks are spades, plus 3d and 5c, so backdoor flush draw possible). But realistically, my hand is too weak to value bet.\n\nBetter to check and see what happens on the river. If opponent bets river, I can easily fold. If they check again, I might consider a small bet if I improve or check back.\n\nLet me check.",

They've shown some aggression (raised hand #21 and #29), but mostly folding. In hand #29, they raised preflop, bet flop, then checked turn and river. This suggests they might be capable of aggression but also capable of giving up.\n\n**Hand Progression:**\n- Preflop: SB limped, I checked in BB\n- Flop: Both checked\n- Turn: Both checked  \n- River: Opponent checked\n\nThis is a very passive line from both players. The board is A-K-5-3-8. With two pair, I'm likely ahead here. What could opponent have?\n\n**Possible Opponent Hands:**\n- Weak Ace (A-x, maybe A-2, A-4, A-6, A-7, A-9, etc.)\n- Weak King (K-x)\n- Middle pocket pair (QQ, JJ, TT, 99, etc.)\n- Missed draws (QJ, JT, maybe some spade draws that missed)\n- Possibly a slow-played monster (set, two pair)\n\n**Decision:**\nI have two pair on a dry board. The pot is tiny (8 chips). Opponent checked to me. I should value bet here to extract value from weaker hands like weak Aces or Kings. A small bet could get called by worse hands.\n\nHowever, there's also merit to checking back since:\n1. Pot is very small\n2. Opponent might fold most weak holdings anyway\n3. If opponent has a better hand (like A8 or 85, which gives them better two pair, or a set), they might check-raise\n\nBut given the passive line from opponent (limp preflop, check all streets), they're unlikely to have a monster. A set or better two pair would probably bet at some point.\n\n**Bet Sizing:**\nMinimum raise is 4 chips (total bet of 4). I could bet 4-8 chips (half to full pot). Since pot is only 8, a 4-chip bet seems reasonable.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nMy stack is healthy at 50BB. No need to take big risks, but this is a small pot with a likely winning hand.\n\nI think a small value bet is correct. Let me bet 6 chips (total)."

I need to respond with a JSON object containing 'action', 'raise_to' (if raising), and 'reasoning'. Let me reconsider the hand and provide the proper response.\n\nI'm on the river with 5h 8s on a board of 5c As Ks 3d 8c. I have two pair: fives and eights with an Ace kicker. The pot is 8 chips, opponent checked to me, and I have 0 to call. Legal actions are fold, check, raise.\n\nAnalysis: I have a strong hand - two pair. The board is dry: no flush possible (I have no spade, river is club), no straight possible. Opponent limped preflop and checked all streets. This suggests weakness. They could have a weak Ace, weak King, middle pocket pair, or missed draw. With two pair, I'm likely ahead.\n\nPot is tiny (8 chips). I should value bet. Minimum raise is 4 chips (total bet of 4). I could bet 4-8 chips. Since opponent seems passive, a small bet might get called by worse hands like weak Aces or Kings.\n\nBet sizing: I'll bet 6 chips total (raise_to 6). That's a 6-chip bet into 8-chip pot - reasonable.\n\nAction: raise. raise_to: 6. Reasoning: I have two pair on a dry board. Opponent has shown passive line (limp pre, check all streets). Small value bet to extract chips from weaker holdings like weak Aces or Kings. Pot is small, so no need to overbet.\n\nLet me format this as JSON.",

I need to call 6 chips to continue.\n\nLooking at the opponent actions: GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop in hand #32 to 24 chips (6x BB) and then bet aggressively on the flop. In this hand, they raised to 8 (2x BB), which is a smaller raise. Kimi-K2 Thinking has mostly been folding preflop but called a small amount in hand #33 and now called this raise.\n\nMy hand 3\u26605\u2663 is terrible - it's suited but only 3-5 offsuit, one of the weakest starting hands. I'm out of position (small blind) which makes playing this hand even worse. The pot odds: I need to call 6 chips into a pot of 22+6=28 if I call, so about 21.4% pot odds. But with such a weak hand, even if I hit a pair, it's likely dominated.\n\nIn tournament poker, preserving stack is important. With 52.2 BB, I have a decent stack. Calling 6 chips (1.5 BB) with this trash hand is burning chips. Even if I hit a miracle flop, I'm out of position and will struggle to realize equity.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot.

Shows aggressive tendencies, but has shown down some marginal hands like QTo, JKh. Likely to defend his SB with a wide range.\n2. **Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B - BB):** Also raises preflop frequently (6 times). Has shown down strong hands like KcAd, KsQs, AdTs.

From the button with no raises yet, this is a clear raising hand.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 52 BB, which is a healthy stack. I want to accumulate chips but also preserve my stack. Being on the button gives me positional advantage postflop.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Too weak - KQo on button is definitely playable\n2. **Call:** Would be okay but not maximizing value\n3. **Raise:** Best option - standard play with KQo on button\n\n**Raise sizing:** Minimum raise is to 8 (double the BB). But I should consider a larger raise to 12-16 to get value and potentially take down the blinds preflop. Looking at past patterns, opponents have raised to 8-12 in similar spots.\n\nGiven that both blinds have shown aggressive tendencies, I should raise to 12-16 to give myself a better chance to take it down preflop or play a larger pot with position.\n\nI'll raise to 12 (3x BB).

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation:\n\nHand #35, I'm on the BTN with Qs Kh. I raised preflop to 12 (3x BB). Both SB (MiniMax-M2) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B) called.\n\nFlop: Qd 6c 6s (paired board with my top pair, queen). Both opponents checked to me.\n\nMy hand: Top pair, decent kicker (king). Board is Qd 6c 6s - paired sixes. This is a good flop for my hand. I have top pair, and the paired board reduces the chance opponents have strong draws (no flush draws, only possible straight draws like 87, 54, but those are unlikely given preflop action).\n\nPot is 36 chips. My stack: 197 chips (49.2 BB). SB has 191 chips, BB has 256 chips.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see opponent tendencies:\n\nMiniMax-M2 (SB):\n- Has shown some aggression preflop (raising with various hands)\n- In hand 25, called a 3-bet preflop with Jh Kh on a 2s 2h Qd board, then check-called turn\n- In hand 30, bet small on flop with 4h 6h on 8d 9h 6c board, then check-called turn, then big river bet\n- Seems capable of bluffing and value betting\n\nGPT-OSS-120B (BB):\n- In hand 25, 3-bet preflop with Ad Ts, then checked flop on 2s 2h Qd, bet turn\n- In hand 30, raised preflop with 4h 6h, called small flop bet, bet small turn, folded to big river bet\n- In hand 32, 3-bet preflop with Kc Ad, bet flop on Ks 4s Qc, checked turn and river\n\nBoth seem like reasonable players. The check from both on this flop suggests they don't have strong hands (probably no Qx, no 6x). They could have pocket pairs below Q, suited connectors, or maybe slow-playing a monster (though unlikely with two checks).\n\nGiven I have position and top pair, I should bet for value. A bet of around half pot (18 chips) to 2/3 pot (24 chips) seems reasonable. I want to get value from weaker Qx hands (QJ, QT, Q9), pocket pairs (77-JJ), and some draws.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that the board is paired with sixes. This means if someone has a 6, they have trips and are likely slow-playing. But given preflop action, 6x hands are less likely (except maybe A6s, but even those might have folded to a raise). Both called my preflop raise, so their ranges should be decent.\n\nI could also check to see a turn card, but betting is better for value and protection. If I check back, I give free cards to hands like JT, T9, 87 that could make straights on turn.\n\nLet me think about sizing: Minimum raise is 8 (total bet of 8). I could bet 12-24. I'll go with 20 chips (a bit over half pot).\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 20,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Top pair with good kicker on paired board. Both opponents checked, indicating weakness.

The turn brought a K, giving me kings up with queens. \n\nThe pot is 96 chips. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) just bet 20 into me. I have to call 20. My stack is 177 chips, so calling 20 is reasonable. But I have a very strong hand - I should consider raising. The minimum raise is to 40 total (20 more). I could raise to build the pot.\n\nLet me think about opponent tendencies. Seat 4 called my preflop raise and called my flop bet. Now they lead out on the turn with a 20 chip bet into a 96 chip pot. This could be a value bet with a hand like a 6, a weaker queen, a king, or a draw. The board is paired with 6s, so there's a possibility they have trips. But I have top two pair, which is very strong.\n\nWith the flush draw on board (Kc on turn, board has Qd 6c 6s Kc - two clubs), they could be betting a flush draw. Or they could have a 6 for trips. But I should be ahead of most of their range.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 20 to win 116 (96 + 20). That's about 1:5.8 odds, so I only need about 15% equity. I have much more than that.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 177 chips (44 BB), which is a healthy stack. Building pots with strong hands is good.\n\nI should probably raise for value. A raise to maybe 60-80 would be good. Let me check legal actions - I can raise. The minimum raise is to 40, but I should raise more.\n\nGiven my strong hand and position, I'll raise to build the pot and charge draws. I'll raise to 80 total (adding 60 to the 20 call).

I have Qs and Kh, giving me two pair: Queens and Kings. But board already has two Queens (Qd and Qc), so I have trips Queens with a King kicker? Wait: board has Qd and Qc, I have Qs, so that's three Queens. Plus I have Kh, giving me a full house? Actually board is Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. That's Q-Q-6-6-K. I have Qs Kh. So my hand is Qs Qd Qc (three Queens) plus Kh and 6c? Wait best five-card hand: I have three Queens (Qs, Qd, Qc), plus a King (Kh), plus a 6 (6c). That's trips Queens with King kicker. But there's also two 6s on board. So board has two 6s. That means possible full houses: someone could have a 6 for quad 6s? No, quad 6s would require pocket 6s. Or someone could have Q6 for full house (Queens full of 6s). Or K6 for Kings full of 6s. Or pocket Kings for Kings full of Queens. Or pocket Queens for quad Queens. Or pocket Kings for Kings full of Queens. Actually pocket Kings would give K-K-Q-Q-6, which is Kings full of Queens.\n\nMy hand: Qs Kh. Board: Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. My best five: Qs Qd Qc Kh 6c = trips Queens, King kicker. Wait, but there's a King on board too (Kc). So I have two pair: Queens and Kings? Actually I have Qs and Kh, board has Qd, Qc, Kc, 6c, 6s. So I have two Queens (my Qs plus board Qd and Qc - I can use two of them? Actually I can use any five cards. I have Qs, Kh, and board Qd, Qc, Kc, 6c, 6s. Best combination: use Qs, Qd, Qc for three Queens, plus Kc and Kh for two Kings? Wait, I have Kh and board has Kc, so that's two Kings. So I have a full house: Queens full of Kings? Let's see: three Queens (Qs, Qd, Qc) and two Kings (Kh, Kc). That's Queens full of Kings. Yes! That's a full house. Board shows Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. I have Qs Kh. So my hand is Qs Qd Qc Kh Kc. That's three Queens and two Kings = Queens full of Kings. That's a very strong hand.\n\nBut there are possible better hands: quad Queens (if someone has Qx), quad 6s (pocket 6s), or better full houses: Kings full of Queens (if someone has KK), or Queens full of 6s (if someone has Q6), or Kings full of 6s (if someone has K6), or 6s full of Queens (if someone has 66). Actually 66 would be quad 6s, not full house. Let's list possible holdings that beat me:\n\n1. Pocket Kings (KK): would give Kings full of Queens (K\u2660 K\u2665 with board Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc = K\u2660 K\u2665 Kc Qd Qc = Kings full of Queens). That beats my Queens full of Kings.\n\n2. Pocket Queens (QQ): would give quad Queens.\n\n3. Q6: would give Queens full of 6s (Q\u2660 6\u2665 with board Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc = Q\u2660 Qd Qc 6\u2665 6c = Queens full of 6s). That beats my Queens full of Kings? Actually Queens full of 6s vs Queens full of Kings: both have three Queens, but the pair is 6s vs Kings. Kings are higher than 6s, so my Queens full of Kings beats Queens full of 6s. Wait, in full house ranking, the triplet rank is compared first. Both have three Queens, so we compare the pair: Kings vs 6s. Kings are higher, so my hand beats Q6. So Q6 is worse than my hand.\n\n4. K6: would give Kings full of 6s (K\u2660 6\u2665 with board Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc ="

That's a very strong full house.\n\nOpponent: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 31 chips total. They bet 60 on river, but they only have 31 chips? Wait, they have 31 chips total. They bet 60? That seems impossible. Let me check: \"river: Seat 4 bet 60\". But they only have 31 chips. Maybe they're all-in? Actually they have 31 chips, so betting 60 would be all-in for their remaining stack. The pot is 296 chips, amount to call is 60, but opponent only has 31 chips. Something seems off. Let me reconstruct the hand.\n\nPreflop: I raised to 12, Seat 4 called 10, Seat 5 called 8.\nFlop: I bet 20, Seat 4 called 20, Seat 5 folded.\nTurn: Seat 4 bet 20, I raised to 80, Seat 4 called 60.\nRiver: Seat 4 bet 60.\n\nBut Seat 4 started with 31 chips. Preflop they called 10, leaving 21. Flop they called 20, leaving 1. Turn they bet 20? That would put them all-in if they only had 1 left. Actually they bet 20 on turn, then I raised to 80, they called 60. But if they only had 1 chip after flop, they couldn't bet 20. Let me check stack sizes again: \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 31 chips\". That's current stack at start of river? Or at start of hand? Probably at start of hand. So they started with 31 chips.\n\nPreflop: They called 10 (SB was 2, so they called additional 10 to match my 12 raise). So they put in 12 total? Actually SB is 2, they called 10 more to make 12. So after preflop, they have 31-12=19 chips.\n\nFlop: They called 20. But they only have 19 chips, so they're all-in. Actually they can't call 20 with 19 chips - they'd be all-in for 19. So maybe the 20 bet was less? Or maybe stack sizes are current at this moment. Let me think: At river, they bet 60, but they have 31 chips total. So the bet of 60 must be all-in for their remaining stack. That means amount to call is 60, but I only need to call 60 to win the pot. My stack is 97 chips, so I can afford it.\n\nGiven the board and action, what could opponent have? They called preflop from SB, called flop, donk bet turn, called my raise, then bet river. This looks like they have a strong hand. Possible holdings: Q6, K6, maybe a flush draw that missed? Board has Qc and Kc and 6c and Qc? Actually board has Qc and Kc and 6c? Wait board: Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. So there are three clubs: 6c, Kc, Qc. That's a possible flush. But I don't have any clubs. Opponent could have been on a flush draw. But they bet turn before the third club came? Actually turn card was Qc? Wait board: Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. So flop was Qd 6c 6s. Turn was Kc. River was Qc. So turn brought the King of clubs, river brought the Queen of clubs. So on turn, there were two clubs (6c and Kc). River made three clubs. So if opponent had a flush draw on turn, they hit on river.\n\nBut their betting pattern: check-call flop, donk bet turn, call raise, then bet river. That's consistent with a flush draw that turned into a flush. Or they could have a full house. Given they're short-stacked (31 chips), they might be pushing with any decent hand.\n\nMy hand is very strong - Queens full of Kings. Only beaten by quad Queens, quad 6s, or Kings full of Queens (pocket Kings). Pocket Kings is unlikely given preflop action - I raised, they called from SB. Would they call with KK? Possibly. But also possible they have Q6 or K6 for lower full house, or a flush.\n\nPot is 296 chips, I need to call 60. That's about 5:1 pot odds. I have to"

I have Qs and Kh, giving me two pair: Queens and Kings. But board already has two Queens (Qd and Qc), so I have trips Queens with a King kicker? Wait: board has Qd and Qc, I have Qs, so that's three Queens. Plus I have Kh, giving me a full house? Actually board is Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. That's Q-Q-6-6-K. I have Qs Kh. So my hand is Qs Qd Qc (three Queens) plus Kh and 6c? Wait best five-card hand: I have three Queens (Qs, Qd, Qc), plus a King (Kh), plus a 6 (6c). That's trips Queens with King kicker. But there's also two 6s on board. So board has two 6s. That means possible full houses: someone could have a 6 for quad 6s? No, quad 6s would require pocket 6s. Or someone could have Q6 for full house (Queens full of 6s). Or K6 for Kings full of 6s. Or pocket Kings for Kings full of Queens. Or pocket Queens for quad Queens. Or pocket Kings for Kings full of Queens. Actually pocket Kings would give K-K-Q-Q-6, which is Kings full of Queens.\n\nMy hand: Qs Kh. Board: Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. My best five: Qs Qd Qc Kh 6c = trips Queens, King kicker. Wait, but there's a King on board too (Kc). So I have two pair: Queens and Kings? Actually I have Qs and Kh, board has Qd, Qc, Kc, 6c, 6s. So I have two Queens (my Qs plus board Qd and Qc - I can use two of them? Actually I can use any five cards. I have Qs, Kh, and board Qd, Qc, Kc, 6c, 6s. Best combination: use Qs, Qd, Qc for three Queens, plus Kc and Kh for two Kings? Wait, I have Kh and board has Kc, so that's two Kings. So I have a full house: Queens full of Kings? Let's see: three Queens (Qs, Qd, Qc) and two Kings (Kh, Kc). That's Queens full of Kings. Yes! That's a full house. Board shows Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. I have Qs Kh. So my hand is Qs Qd Qc Kh Kc. That's three Queens and two Kings = Queens full of Kings. That's a very strong hand.\n\nBut there are possible better hands: quad Queens (if someone has Qx), quad 6s (pocket 6s), or better full houses: Kings full of Queens (if someone has KK), or Queens full of 6s (if someone has Q6), or Kings full of 6s (if someone has K6), or 6s full of Queens (if someone has 66). Actually 66 would be quad 6s, not full house. Let's list possible holdings that beat me:\n\n1. Pocket Kings (KK): would give Kings full of Queens (K\u2660 K\u2665 with board Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc = K\u2660 K\u2665 Kc Qd Qc = Kings full of Queens). That beats my Queens full of Kings.\n\n2. Pocket Queens (QQ): would give quad Queens.\n\n3. Q6: would give Queens full of 6s (Q\u2660 6\u2665 with board Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc = Q\u2660 Qd Qc 6\u2665 6c = Queens full of 6s). That beats my Queens full of Kings? Actually Queens full of 6s vs Queens full of Kings: both have three Queens, but the pair is 6s vs Kings. Kings are higher than 6s, so my Queens full of Kings beats Queens full of 6s. Wait, in full house ranking, the triplet rank is compared first. Both have three Queens, so we compare the pair: Kings vs 6s. Kings are higher, so my hand beats Q6. So Q6 is worse than my hand.\n\n4. K6: would give Kings full of 6s (K\u2660 6\u2665 with board Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc =",

Wait, they have 31 chips total. They bet 60? That seems impossible. Let me check: \"river: Seat 4 bet 60\". But they only have 31 chips. Maybe they're all-in? Actually they have 31 chips, so betting 60 would be all-in for their remaining stack. The pot is 296 chips, amount to call is 60, but opponent only has 31 chips. Something seems off.

That's current stack at start of river? Or at start of hand? Probably at start of hand. So they started with 31 chips.\n\nPreflop: They called 10 (SB was 2, so they called additional 10 to match my 12 raise). So they put in 12 total? Actually SB is 2, they called 10 more to make 12. So after preflop, they have 31-12=19 chips.\n\nFlop: They called 20. But they only have 19 chips, so they're all-in. Actually they can't call 20 with 19 chips - they'd be all-in for 19.

The 3x raise from SB is standard.\n\nMy hand JTo is decent but not great, especially offsuit. It's a hand that can make straights and sometimes top pair, but has reverse implied odds (dominated by AJ, KJ, QJ, etc.).\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 16, which is 2:1 odds (33% equity needed). JTo vs a typical SB raising range (maybe 30-40% of hands) has about 35-40% equity, so pot odds are favorable.\n\nHowever, position is bad - I'll be out of position postflop. JTo plays poorly out of position.\n\nStack sizes: I have a healthy stack (97 BB), opponent has 74 BB. Not deep enough for implied odds to play speculative hands.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm in good chip position, no need to take marginal spots.\n\nGiven this is heads-up SB vs BB, ranges widen considerably. SB should be raising wide, and BB should be defending wide. But JTo is near the bottom of a defending range.\n\nI could consider a 3-bet bluff since SB might be raising light, but with JTo and out of position, that's risky.\n\nBetter to just call and see a flop with decent pot odds, then play carefully postflop. If I hit a good flop (pair + straight draw, etc.), I can continue. Otherwise, fold.\n\nLet me call and see a flop.",

Wait, board is K-A-9, my J-T gives me an open-ended straight draw? Let me check: Board: Kd, Ad, 9h. My Js Td. Possible straights: QJ-T-9-8? Actually, with K-A-9 on board and J-T in hand, I need a Q for a straight (K-Q-J-T-9). That's a gutshot, not open-ended. Also have backdoor flush potential with the Td and board having Kd, but only one diamond so far. Very weak made hand - only high card is J, but board has K and A higher. Basically I have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs to a Q) and very little else.\n\n**Position:** I'm in BB, opponent is SB who raised preflop. They checked to me on the flop.\n\n**Opponent Analysis from memory:**\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has shown aggressive preflop raising tendencies (5 raises in 36 hands)\n- They've shown hands like 9s8s, 9s9d, As8h at showdown\n- On the flop, they often check (multiple instances) but also bet sometimes\n- In hand #29 with 99, they bet 18 on flop after raising preflop\n- In hand #6 with 98s, they bet 28 on flop\n\n**Pot Odds:** Pot is 24, I can check for free or bet. If I bet and get called, I need to consider future streets.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I have a healthy stack (381 vs opponent's 298). This is a marginal spot where I could try to take the pot with a bet, but need to be careful.\n\n**Possible Actions:**\n1. **Check:** Take a free card with my gutshot draw. Safe play given weak hand.\n2. **Bet:** Try to take the pot down now. Opponent checked, which could indicate weakness. A bet of around 12-16 (half pot) might work.\n\n**Opponent Range:** They raised preflop from SB. Could have: pairs (especially medium pairs like TT-QQ, maybe 99), Broadway cards (AQ, AJ, KQ, etc.), suited connectors. The flop K-A-9 hits a lot of their raising range (AK, AQ, AJ, KQ, maybe AA, KK, 99). But they checked, which suggests they might not have hit strongly or have a medium-strength hand.\n\n**My Image:** From my hand history, I recently won a big pot with QsKh (hand #35) and have been playing fairly tight.\n\n**Decision:** I think a small bet could work here. Opponent checked, which often shows weakness after raising preflop. They might fold hands like medium pairs (TT-QQ) that are afraid of the A and K on board. My bet would represent strength - maybe I have an A or K. Even if called, I still have my gutshot draw.\n\nBut I need to consider: If I bet and get raised, I'll have to fold. That would be bad. However, looking at opponent's history, they don't seem to check-raise much on flop (search showed no matches).\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The board is Kd Ad 9h. This is a very wet board that hits a lot of raising ranges. My J-high is basically air with a gutshot. A bet here is a pure bluff. Is it a good bluff?\n\nFactors favoring a bluff:\n1. Opponent checked (showing weakness)\n2. I'm out of position, so taking initiative could help\n3. Board has A and K, which are scare cards for many hands\n\nFactors against bluffing:\n1. I have some equity (gutshot) so checking to see a free card isn't terrible\n2. Opponent might call with any pair or draw\n3. If called, I'll be out of position on later streets\n\nGiven my tournament chip stack is healthy, I think checking is reasonable. I can see a free turn card and potentially hit my straight. If I miss, I can give up unless the turn improves my hand in some way.\n\nActually, wait - I'm in the BB"

Very weak made hand. \n\nOpponent checked. Could be checking with a strong hand to trap, or weak hand. From memory, opponent is somewhat aggressive but not excessively so. They've shown hands like 98s, 99, A8s. \n\nIf I bet, I'm representing strength on an A-high board. Could get folds from medium pairs, maybe some weak aces.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand: #37**\n- My position: BB (Seat 3)\n- My cards: Js Td\n- My stack: 381 chips (95.2 BB)\n- Board: Kd Ad 9h 8s (turn)\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Opponent: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) with 298 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (opponent checked)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have Js Td on a board of Kd Ad 9h 8s. I have a straight draw - any Queen gives me a straight (Q gives me J-T-9-8-Q straight, but wait... actually I need a Queen for a straight? Let me think: Board is K-A-9-8. I have J-T. So my hand is J-T. For a straight, I need a Queen for J-T-Q-K-A (broadway) or a 7 for 7-8-9-T-J. So I have an open-ended straight draw with 8 outs (four 7s and four Qs). However, the board has two diamonds (Kd, Ad) but my Js Td includes the Td, so I have a backdoor flush draw with one diamond.\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nSeat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has shown:\n- Preflop: Raises (12 in hand 29), folds, calls, etc.\n- Postflop: In hand 29, they bet flop (18), checked turn and river with 99 on a 4-5-6-7-J board\n- In hand 33, they checked through all streets with weak hand\n- In hand 34, they checked through all streets with A8o on a 3-2-7-2-8 board\n\nThey seem to be a cautious player who checks when weak or when board is scary. Their check on the turn here could indicate weakness or a trap.\n\n**Pot odds and situation:**\nPot is 24 chips. I can check to see a free river, or bet for value/protection. With an open-ended straight draw (8 outs), I have about 17% chance to hit on the river (8/46 \u2248 17.4%). If I bet and get called, I need to consider implied odds.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack of 381 chips (95 BB). Opponent has 298 chips. I have position (acted last on turn). Checking gives me a free river card, which is good for my draw. Betting could get folds from weaker hands, but might also get raised by stronger hands.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that:\n1. I have a decent draw (open-ended straight, backdoor flush)\n2. Opponent checked twice (preflop raiser checked flop and turn, suggesting weakness)\n3. Pot is relatively small (24 chips)\n4. I have position\n\nI think checking is reasonable to see a free river. Betting could be good for protection if I think opponent has a weak hand that might outdraw me, but with my draw, I want to see the river cheaply. However, a small bet might also be good to build the pot if I hit.\n\nActually, let me think about opponent's range. They raised preflop from SB to 12 (3x BB). What could they have? Could be strong hands like AK, AQ, AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, or medium pairs, or suited connectors. The board has K-A-9-8 with two diamonds. They checked flop and turn. If they had top pair (AK) or two pair, they might bet. Their check suggests either a weak hand or a trap.\n\nGiven that I have position and a draw, checking seems fine. But a small bet could also work to apply pressure.\n\nActually, I should consider that if I check, opponent might bet river if they improve or if I miss. But I have position, so I can decide on river.\n\nI think I'll check to see the river for free. If I hit my straight, I can bet for value. If I miss, I can check or bluff depending on the river card.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking to see a free river with open-ended straight draw (8 outs).

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n- My hand: Js Td\n- Board: Kd Ad 9h 8s\n- I have an open-ended straight draw: I need a Q (for QJT98 straight) or a 7 (for JT987 straight). That's 8 outs.\n- Opponent (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised preflop from SB, then checked both flop and turn.\n- The pot is only 24 chips.\n- I have position on opponent.\n- My stack is 381 chips (95 BB), opponent has 298 chips.\n\nFrom the opponent history, they seem to be playing passively - mostly checking and calling. They raised preflop this hand (12 total), but then checked twice. This could indicate they have a hand like AK, AQ, or maybe a pocket pair that missed the flop.\n\nSince the pot is small and I have a strong draw, I could consider betting to try to win the pot now. However, betting might fold out weaker hands that I want to keep in the pot. Checking gives me a free river card with 8 outs (~16% chance to hit on river, ~32% chance from turn).\n\nGiven opponent's passive tendencies and the small pot size, checking seems reasonable to see a free river. If I hit my straight on the river, I can then bet for value.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that my hand has some showdown value if I don't hit - J high is weak, but opponent's checking suggests they might not have much either.\n\nActually, wait - I should think about this more carefully. The board is Kd Ad 9h 8s. There are flush draws possible (diamonds). My Js Td gives me a diamond draw too (Td). So I have additional equity with backdoor flush potential.\n\nBut the main consideration: checking is free, betting risks getting raised or called when I'm drawing. Since opponent raised preflop, they likely have at least some strength. Their turn check after checking flop could be a trap with a strong hand like two pair or a set.\n\nGiven the small pot and my position advantage, checking seems best. I'll take the free card and evaluate on the river.",

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation:\n\nHand #37, I'm in BB with Js Td. Board: Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s. Pot: 24 chips. Opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has checked on the river. I have 381 chips (95.2 BB). Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand: Js Td gives me a straight draw that missed. Board has Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s. I have jack-high, no pair, no flush draw (I have Js but board has 4s, not enough for flush). Best possible hand is a straight with QJ, but I have JT, so I need a Q for a straight, but board already has K and A, so QJ would give me a straight to the Ace, but I don't have Q. Actually, wait: Board is Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s. With JT, I need a Q for a straight (QJ T 9 8). But no Q on board. So I have jack-high, no pair.\n\nOpponent's actions: preflop raise from SB to 12 (3x BB), I called from BB. Flop: Kd Ad 9h - opponent checked, I checked. Turn: 8s - opponent checked, I checked. River: 4s - opponent checked.\n\nOpponent likely has a weak hand that missed or a medium pair. They raised preflop from SB, which could be a wide range. Then checked flop, turn, and river. This suggests weakness. They might have missed completely or have a small pair.\n\nPot is 24 chips. If I bet, I could potentially take it down with a bluff. However, I have jack-high, which is very weak. But opponent has shown weakness throughout.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been fairly passive - checking and folding often. In hand #33, they checked river and then folded. In hand #34, they called preflop then checked all streets. In hand #35, they folded preflop. In hand #36, they checked and then folded on flop.\n\nThis opponent seems cautious and likely to fold to aggression.\n\nMy stack is healthy at 381 chips (95 BB). A small bet could win the 24 chip pot. If I get called, I lose, but risk is low.\n\nConsidering pot odds: If I bet 12 chips (half pot), I need opponent to fold more than 33% of the time to be profitable. Given opponent's passive tendencies, they might fold a lot.\n\nBut I should also consider that my hand has absolutely no showdown value. Jack-high will almost certainly lose if we go to showdown. So checking gives me 0% chance to win. Betting gives me some chance.\n\nHowever, I need to think about what hands opponent might have that they'd check three times. They raised preflop, so could have: medium pairs (TT, JJ, QQ?), suited connectors, broadway cards. Flop has K and A, which hit many of their raising range. Their check on flop could be cautious with a hand like QQ, JJ, TT, or maybe a weak ace. But then checking turn and river suggests they don't have a strong hand.\n\nThey might have a small pair like 77 or 66, or maybe a hand like QJ, QT, JT similar to mine. Or maybe a busted draw.\n\nGiven the board has two spades, but I have Js, so they can't have a flush with J-high. Flush would require 3 spades on board, but there are only 2 (8s and 4s).\n\nI think a small value bet/bluff is reasonable. But I need to decide amount. Minimum raise is 8 chips, but I can bet any amount from 4 to my stack.\n\nI could bet 12 chips (half pot) or 8 chips (minimum). Smaller bet more likely to get called by weak hands, larger bet more likely to get folds but costs more if called.\n\nGiven opponent's passivity, I think a small bet of 8-12 chips could work.\n\nLet me also consider tournament implications: I have a healthy stack, no need to take big risks. But this is a small pot relative to my stack.\n\nActually, wait: I'm in BB, opponent in SB. They raised preflop, which is standard for SB vs BB. Their range is wide. My call with JTo is marginal but okay from BB getting good odds.\n\nI think I'll bet small to try to take it down."

With 100.8 BB stack, preserving chips is better than playing this marginal spot with a terrible hand. Fold and wait for better opportunities.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3c 9d - This is a very weak hand. 93o is one of the worst possible hands in poker. It has very little potential to make strong hands postflop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (button), which is the best position. However, with such a weak hand, position alone doesn't justify playing.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 403 chips (100.8 BB) - a healthy stack\n   - MiniMax-M2 has only 33 chips (8.25 BB) - very short stacked\n   - The other players have folded\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**: MiniMax-M2 is the big blind with a tiny stack. From the recalled actions, they seem to be playing somewhat loose/calling stations but also capable of betting. With only 33 chips, they're likely to play any two cards aggressively since they're desperate.\n\n5. **Situation**: It's folded to me on the button. I posted the small blind of 2, and need to call 2 more to complete to the big blind of 4. The pot is 6 chips (2 SB + 4 BB). \n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 to win 6, which is 3:1 odds (25% equity needed). Even with 93o, I have about 35-40% equity against a random hand preflop. However, the opponent is short-stacked and could easily shove any two cards.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I have a big stack and should avoid marginal spots\n   - The short stack is desperate and could shove with any two\n   - Playing 93o from the button against a short stack might be tempting to steal, but it's very high variance\n\n8. **Better approach**: With such a weak hand, folding is correct. Even though I have position and the opponent is short, 93o is simply too weak. The risk of the short stack shoving and me having to fold or call with a terrible hand isn't worth the 2 chips.\n\n9. **Alternative consideration**: If I had a stronger hand or if the opponent had a more normal stack, I might consider raising to steal. But with a short stack who could easily shove, and with such a terrible hand, folding is best.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

However, I have position advantage on both remaining players (SB and BB). The SB (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) has only 37 chips (9.25 BB) - very short stacked. The BB (Seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) has 250 chips (62.5 BB).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB, 37 chips): Has shown some aggression (betting on turn and river in hand 35) but is now very short-stacked. Likely to play tight or go all-in with decent hands.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB, 250 chips): Has been folding recently (folded last 3 hands preflop). Showed a raise with Ks Qs in hand 34, but generally seems cautious.\n\nMy stack is 403 chips (100.8 BB) - healthy stack.\n\nGiven the situation:\n1. The SB is extremely short and could easily go all-in\n2. The BB has been folding frequently\n3. I have position on both\n4. My hand is weak but has some potential with an Ace\n\nI could consider raising to try to steal the blinds, but with A3o, it's marginal. However, the SB's short stack makes this interesting - if I raise and SB goes all-in, I'd have to call given pot odds. But SB only has 37 chips total.\n\nActually, let me think about pot odds: If I raise to say 12 (3x BB), and SB goes all-in for 37, the pot would be: SB's 37 + BB's 4 + my 12 = 53. I'd need to call 25 more (37-12) to win 53, getting about 2.1:1 odds. With A3o against a short-stack's range, I'd likely be behind but might have decent equity.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and my healthy stack, I think the best play is to fold this weak hand. A3o doesn't play well postflop, and while I have position, the hand is just too weak to invest chips with.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to think about my hand: 3s Qc. This is a weak hand from UTG (under the gun). Q3 offsuit is a very marginal hand that should typically be folded from early position. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Q3 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands. It has very little potential to make strong hands postflop. No suitedness, no connectivity, low card values.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in UTG (Seat 3), which is the worst position at the table. I'll be acting first on every postflop street, which makes playing weak hands even more difficult.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 403 chips (100.8 BB) - healthy stack\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB): 294 chips\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB? Actually seat 4): 43 chips (very short stack)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (SB): 248 chips\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: From the data:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking raises preflop frequently (6 times in limited sample)\n   - MiniMax-M2 raises preflop very frequently (9 times in sample, often small raises like 4 or 8 chips)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B also raises preflop (6 times)\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 100+ BB, I should be playing tight and preserving my stack. There's no need to play marginal hands from early position.\n\n6. **Action to take**: I need to call 4 chips to see the flop. The pot is currently 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4). If I call, pot becomes 10 chips.\n\nHowever, with Q3o from UTG, this is an easy fold. The hand has terrible reverse implied odds - if I hit a Q, I could easily be dominated by AQ, KQ, QJ, etc. If I hit a 3, it's a weak pair that's vulnerable to overcards.\n\nEven though it's only 4 chips (1% of my stack), calling with such a weak hand from early position is a mistake. Better to wait for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors: The short stack MiniMax-M2 has only 43 chips (10.75 BB) and is in the small blind position (though the display says Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 43 chips, and Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 248 chips posted SB 2). Actually looking at the actions: \"preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 2\" and \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 4\". So Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is SB, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is BB. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) hasn't acted yet and will be after me.\n\nSo the action order: I'm UTG (first to act), then MiniMax-M2, then GPT-OSS-120B (SB), then Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB).\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 raises frequently preflop (especially small raises like 4 chips), there's a good chance he'll raise after I call. Then I'd have to call more chips or fold after putting in 4.\n\nThis makes folding even more correct.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Looking at my current hand: 3s Qc. This is a very weak hand - Queen-high with a 3 offsuit. Queen-3 offsuit is not a playable hand from UTG in tournament poker. It has very little potential to make strong hands postflop, and being out of position makes it even worse.\n\nConsidering the situation:\n- I'm UTG (first to act preflop)\n- Hand: Q3o (very weak)\n- Stack: 403 chips (100.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Players behind: MiniMax-M2 (43 chips - short stack), GPT-OSS-120B (248 chips), and Kimi-K2 Thinking (294 chips)\n\nWith Q3o from UTG, the correct play is to fold. This hand has reverse implied odds - if I hit a Queen, I could be dominated by better Queens. If I hit a 3, it's a weak pair. The hand doesn't have good connectivity or suitedness.\n\nLooking at my past UTG plays, I've been folding similarly weak hands like 7-5s, T-2s, 7-As, Q-8o, K-4o, etc. This hand is worse than most of those.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy 100BB stack, so no need to gamble with marginal hands from early position. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots.\n\nThe pot odds don't matter here because the hand is too weak to play regardless of price.\n\nTherefore, I should fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand:** Jh Qh (suited connectors)\n**Position:** SB (small blind)\n**Stack:** 403 chips (50.4 BB)\n**Opponent:** Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) with 272 chips\n**Action:** Kimi-K2 Thinking raised to 24 total (3x BB)\n**Amount to call:** 20 (from my SB of 4 already posted)\n**Pot:** Currently 36 (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24)\n\nFrom the opponent action recall, I see Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised preflop 6 times in 41 hands:\n- Hand 4: raise 7 (likely from UTG)\n- Hand 14: raise 6\n- Hand 18: raise 6  \n- Hand 21: raise 28 (big raise)\n- Hand 29: raise 12\n- Hand 37: raise 12\n\nThis shows a mix of raise sizes, but generally on the smaller side (6-12 chips) except for one big 28 chip raise. The current raise to 24 is on the larger side.\n\n**My hand analysis:** QJs is a strong hand from SB, especially suited. It has good postflop potential with straight and flush possibilities. Against a single raiser, this is definitely a playable hand.\n\n**Position consideration:** I'm out of position (SB), which is a disadvantage postflop. However, the opponent is UTG+1 (Seat 1) and the BB has only 35 chips (short stack). The BB might fold or call with a wide range since they're short.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 403 chips (50.4 BB), opponent has 272 chips (34 BB). I have a significant stack advantage.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 36, I need to call 20. That's 1.8:1 pot odds (36:20). I need ~36% equity to break even. QJs likely has >40% equity against a typical UTG raising range.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have a healthy stack and can afford to play this hand. Folding would be too tight with QJs.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Too tight with QJs getting good pot odds\n2. **Call:** Reasonable, but out of position\n3. **Raise:** Could 3-bet to isolate the short-stacked BB and take initiative\n\nGiven the opponent's mixed raise sizes and my hand strength, I think a 3-bet is best. The BB is very short (35 chips) and might call with almost any two cards. By raising, I can:\n1. Isolate against the original raiser\n2. Take initiative postflop\n3. Potentially win the pot preflop\n4. Build a pot with a strong drawing hand\n\nI should raise to around 60-80 chips. Let's go with 72 chips (3x the raise of 24). This is a standard 3-bet size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 72,\n  \"reasoning\": \"QJs is strong enough to 3-bet from SB against UTG raiser.

It's not suited, has low connectivity, and J-high is not strong. This is a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is great, but with such a weak hand, position alone doesn't justify playing.\n\n3. **Opponent stacks**: MiniMax-M2 only has 82 chips (10.25 BB) and is in the SB. They're short-stacked and might be forced to defend with a wide range. GPT-OSS-120B has 240 chips (30 BB) in the BB.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: From the search results:\n   - MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression with raises preflop\n   - In hand #42, MiniMax-M2 called a 3-bet with JhQh from SB position\n   - They seem willing to play hands\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 45.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with junk hands.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Calling 8 to win 12 gives me 1.5:1 odds, but with such a weak hand, I'm not getting the implied odds to justify playing.\n\n7. **Alternative actions**: \n   - Raise: Could try to steal blinds, but J6o is too weak for this. If called, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position post-flop.\n   - Call: See a cheap flop, but J6o flops poorly and I'll likely have to fold to any aggression.\n\nGiven the weakness of J6o, the fact that I have two opponents behind me (one short-stacked who might be forced to defend), and my healthy stack size, the correct play is to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nI should preserve my chips and look for better opportunities with stronger hands. The button position is valuable, but not valuable enough to play J6o.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations from my hand history... Looking at my recent hands, I've been folding a lot (28 folds out of 42 hands). That's okay - tight play is often correct in tournaments.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop decision with Kd4d from UTG. Let me think through this:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: K4s is a marginal hand from UTG. It's suited, which gives it some flush potential, but K4 is a weak kicker. In early position, this is generally a fold.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll have to act first on all future streets, making it hard to play postflop.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes**: \n   - I have 364 chips (45.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has only 78 chips (9.75 BB) - very short stack\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 252 chips (31.5 BB)\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 264 chips (33 BB)\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression (raised to 24 in hand 42), but mostly folds preflop. Has shown down mediocre hands like 9s8s, 9s9d, As8h.\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has called raises with QsAs (hand 42), shows willingness to play. Has only 78 chips - likely to shove with any decent hand.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Mostly folds preflop, but has shown down KcAd, KsQs, AdTs - plays premium hands.\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should avoid marginal spots from early position. The short stack (Seat 4) could shove any time, and I don't want to be caught with K4s.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 8 to win 12 (pot is 12). That's 1.5:1 odds, but position and hand strength make this unfavorable.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- K4s from UTG is a clear fold in most situations\n- I'm out of position against 3 players yet to act\n- The short stack could shove, putting me in a tough spot\n- Better to wait for stronger hands in better positions\n\nI should fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze the current hand situation. I'm in the small blind with Qd Ks, a decent hand. The pot is 28 chips (4 SB + 8 BB + 8 from seat 4 call + 8 from seat 5 call). Seat 1 folded. I'm in the small blind, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called, seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called. I have 356 chips (44.5 BB). \n\nFrom opponent history:\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, 70 chips): Has been calling preflop frequently, seems passive. Stack is short (70 chips, 8.75 BB).\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, 256 chips): Has shown some aggression postflop with bets on flop.\n\nMy hand KQo is strong from the small blind. I have position disadvantage since I'll act first postflop, but I'm closing the action preflop. \n\nOptions:\n1. Check: Take a free flop with KQo. This is conservative but reasonable given position disadvantage.\n2. Raise: Build the pot with a strong hand, potentially isolate the short stack or take it down preflop. Minimum raise to 16 (double the current bet).\n\nGiven the short stack in seat 4 (70 chips), raising could put pressure on them. My stack is healthy at 356 chips. KQo plays well heads-up or multiway. A raise to 20-24 might be good to build pot and define hands.\n\nI should consider that both opponents have shown willingness to call preflop. MiniMax-M2 has called multiple times. GPT-OSS-120B called last hand. A raise might get calls from both.\n\nPot odds: If I raise to 16 (additional 8), pot becomes 36, giving me 2.25:1 immediate odds if both call. But more importantly, I have a strong hand that can win without improvement.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, should play aggressively with good hands. KQo is top 10% hand.\n\nI think a raise is best here. Let's raise to 20 chips total (12 more). This is 2.5x the BB, reasonable sizing.",

We raised preflop from BB after two limpers, and both called. The pot is 64 chips.\n\nOur hand: King-high with a backdoor flush draw (spades) and backdoor straight potential (need J and T or A and T). Not a great flop for us - missed completely. We have two overcards but the board is low and dry.\n\nOpponents:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 58 chips (very short stack, 7.25 BB). From the history, they've been calling a lot preflop and have shown some decent hands (Qs As, Qh Jh, etc). They're very short and likely to commit with any decent hand.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 244 chips (30.5 BB). From history, they've been folding a lot preflop but when they play, they tend to bet aggressively on flops. In hand 43, they bet 30 on flop after checking preflop. In hand 44, they bet 48 on flop after calling preflop. Seems to be a somewhat aggressive player postflop.\n\nPosition: We're out of position (SB), which is bad. We have to act first on every street.\n\nGiven the dry board and our weak hand, I think checking is correct. We could consider a continuation bet since we raised preflop, but with two callers and a dry board that likely hit their calling ranges (pairs, draws), a c-bet might not be effective. Also, seat 5 has shown aggression on flops, so if we bet and get raised, we're in a tough spot.\n\nPot odds: If we check and someone bets, we'd need to consider calling. But with just King-high and backdoor draws, we'd need good odds.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been c-betting much.",

However, I have position on both players for the rest of the hand (they act after me on flop, turn, river).\n\nActually wait - I'm SB, so I act first on flop, turn, river. That's bad position.\n\nLet me think about ranges:\n- I raised from SB after limpers. My range should be strong.\n- MiniMax called from BB? Actually Seat 4 is MiniMax, who called preflop. They limped then called my raise. Could have a wide range.\n- GPT-OSS called from UTG? Actually Seat 5 is GPT-OSS, who also limped then called.\n\nGiven the low board, a c-bet might take it down. But if called, I'm out of position with a marginal hand.\n\nI should check to see what they do. If they check behind, I get a free card. If they bet, I can evaluate.\n\nBetter to check here.

          "content": "I'm in a tournament, SB position with Qd Ks. Board is 3h 6s 4s. I have 344 chips (43 BB). I posted BB 8, then raised to 20 preflop (so 12 more). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called, and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called. Seat 4 has only 28 chips left (after calling 12 preflop? Wait, they have 28 chips now, but they called 12 preflop and then bet 30 on flop? That seems impossible if they only have 28 chips total. Let's examine: Seat 4 started with 28 chips. They called 8 preflop (limped), then I raised to 20, they called 12 more (total 20). That would leave them with 8 chips. Then they bet 30 on flop? That can't be right. Maybe the stack display is current stack after actions? Actually, the stack display is likely current stack after posting blinds/calls. Let's recalc: Seat 4 started with 28 chips. They posted no blind (they're not SB/BB). They called 8 preflop (limped). Then I raised to 20, they called 12 more, total 20 invested. That leaves 8 chips. Then they bet 30 on flop? That's impossible. Maybe the stack display is before the hand? Or maybe they have 28 chips remaining after the flop bet? But they bet 30, which would be more than they have. Hmm.\n\nLet me read again: \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 28 chips\". That's likely their current stack after posting blinds/calls. So they have 28 chips left. They called 12 preflop (total 20). Then on flop they bet 30? That would be all-in if they only have 28 left. Actually, the bet size is 30, but they might be all-in for less. The amount to call is 30, but if Seat 4 has only 28 chips, the effective bet might be 28. However, Seat 5 called 30, so maybe Seat 4 actually has more chips? Let's check the pot size: Pot is 124 chips. Preflop: SB posted 4, BB (me) posted 8, Seat 4 called 8, Seat 5 called 8, I raised 20 (so added 12 more), Seat 4 called 12, Seat 5 called 12. That's 4+8+8+8+12+12+12 = 64? Wait: 4+8=12, +8=20, +8=28, +12=40, +12=52, +12=64. Pot preflop should be 64. But pot is 124 on flop. That includes flop bets: Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, so 64+30+30=124. So Seat 4 indeed bet 30, and Seat 5 called 30. So Seat 4 must have had at least 30 chips after preflop. So maybe the stack display is before the hand started? Let's assume Seat 4 has 28 chips now after betting 30? That would mean they had 58 chips before hand, invested 20 preflop, leaving 38, then bet 30 leaving 8. But display shows 28. Could be a mistake. Let's not overthink; we know Seat 4 is short-stacked (28 chips). They bet 30, which is likely all-in (or close). Seat 5 called 30. So there's a side pot between me and Seat 5 if I call.\n\nMy hand: Qd Ks. Board: 3h 6s 4s. I have overcards, no flush draw (I have Ks, but board has two spades; I have Qd not spade). So I have two overcards (K and Q) to a 6-high board. Backdoor flush draw? I have Ks, so I have a spade, but need two more spades for flush. Actually board has 6s and 4s, so there are two spades on board. I have Ks, so I have a flush draw: three spades on board plus my Ks gives me a flush draw! Wait: board has 6s and 4s (two spades). I have Ks, so I have a spade. That's a flush draw! I need two more spades on turn and river. Actually, I have a flush draw: I need one more spade to make a flush (since I have one spade, board has two spades,"

Seat 5 has 214 chips. I have 344 chips.\n\nSeat 4's history: they've shown some calling with suited hands (Qs As, Qh Jh, Qd Th). They tend to call preflop and sometimes bet flop. They might have a pair or a draw. Seat 5's history: they've shown aggression on flops (bet 30 in hand 43, bet 48 in hand 44). They have called preflop here. They might have a pair or a draw.\n\nMy preflop raise was to 20 (2.5x BB) from BB after two limpers. That's standard. Both called. I checked flop (standard with overcards and draw). Seat 4 bet 30 (pot-sized relative to preflop pot?). Seat 5 called.\n\nGiven I have a flush draw and overcards, I have good equity. I should consider raising to isolate or build pot. However, Seat 4 is short and all-in likely, so there will be side pot with Seat 5. If I raise, I can put pressure on Seat 5 who might fold marginal hands. But if Seat 5 has a strong hand, they might re-raise. My stack is healthy (43 BB). I could call and see turn, but raising might be better to maximize fold equity and build pot for my draw.\n\nLet's calculate: If I call 30, pot becomes 154 (124+30). If I raise, minimum raise to 60 (total). That's 30 more. Seat 5 would need to call 30 more to continue. They have 214 chips, so they can call. If they fold, I win side pot with Seat 4? Actually, Seat 4 is all-in, so main pot includes Seat 4's bet, side pot between me and Seat 5 if I raise and Seat 5 calls. If Seat 5 folds, I win the entire pot (124 + my call? Wait, if Seat 5 folds to my raise, then pot is 124 (current) + my raise to 60 (I put 60 total, but I already have 0 in? Actually, I haven't acted yet. Pot is 124 including Seat 4's 30 and Seat 5's 30. I need to call 30. If I raise to 60, I put 60 total, which is 30 more than calling. So pot becomes 124 + 30 (my extra) = 154. Seat 5 would need to call 30 more to continue, making pot 184. If Seat 5 folds, I win 154 pot.\n\nBut Seat 4 is all-in, so main pot is 64 (preflop) + 30+30 = 124? Actually, preflop pot was 64. Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, so main pot is 64+30+30=124. That's the pot before my action. If I call, main pot becomes 154. If I raise and Seat 5 folds, main pot is 124 + my 30 = 154, but Seat 4 is all-in, so they can only win the portion they contributed. Actually, side pot rules: main pot includes up to the all-in player's contribution. Seat 4 has 28 chips left? They bet 30, but maybe they have 28 left after betting? The bet size is 30, but if they have only 28, the effective bet is 28. So main pot includes up to 28 from each player. Let's simplify: I have good equity and should continue. Raising could win immediately if Seat 5 folds. But Seat 5 has called flop bet, indicating some strength. They might have a pair, maybe middle pair, or a draw. They might call a raise.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, I have a big stack relative to others (43 BB). Seat 5 has 26.75 BB. I should play aggressively with draws. I'll raise to apply pressure.\n\nLet's decide:"

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called, and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called. Seat 4 has only 28 chips left (after calling 12 preflop? Wait, they have 28 chips now, but they called 12 preflop and then bet 30 on flop? That seems impossible if they only have 28 chips total. Let's examine: Seat 4 started with 28 chips. They called 8 preflop (limped), then I raised to 20, they called 12 more (total 20). That would leave them with 8 chips. Then they bet 30 on flop? That can't be right. Maybe the stack display is current stack after actions? Actually, the stack display is likely current stack after posting blinds/calls. Let's recalc: Seat 4 started with 28 chips. They posted no blind (they're not SB/BB). They called 8 preflop (limped). Then I raised to 20, they called 12 more, total 20 invested. That leaves 8 chips. Then they bet 30 on flop? That's impossible. Maybe the stack display is before the hand? Or maybe they have 28 chips remaining after the flop bet? But they bet 30, which would be more than they have. Hmm.\n\nLet me read again: \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 28 chips\". That's likely their current stack after posting blinds/calls. So they have 28 chips left. They called 12 preflop (total 20). Then on flop they bet 30? That would be all-in if they only have 28 left. Actually, the bet size is 30, but they might be all-in for less. The amount to call is 30, but if Seat 4 has only 28 chips, the effective bet might be 28. However, Seat 5 called 30, so maybe Seat 4 actually has more chips? Let's check the pot size: Pot is 124 chips. Preflop: SB posted 4, BB (me) posted 8, Seat 4 called 8, Seat 5 called 8, I raised 20 (so added 12 more), Seat 4 called 12, Seat 5 called 12. That's 4+8+8+8+12+12+12 = 64? Wait: 4+8=12, +8=20, +8=28, +12=40, +12=52, +12=64. Pot preflop should be 64. But pot is 124 on flop. That includes flop bets: Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, so 64+30+30=124. So Seat 4 indeed bet 30, and Seat 5 called 30. So Seat 4 must have had at least 30 chips after preflop. So maybe the stack display is before the hand started? Let's assume Seat 4 has 28 chips now after betting 30? That would mean they had 58 chips before hand, invested 20 preflop, leaving 38, then bet 30 leaving 8. But display shows 28. Could be a mistake. Let's not overthink; we know Seat 4 is short-stacked (28 chips). They bet 30, which is likely all-in (or close). Seat 5 called 30. So there's a side pot between me and Seat 5 if I call.\n\nMy hand: Qd Ks. Board: 3h 6s 4s. I have overcards, no flush draw (I have Ks, but board has two spades; I have Qd not spade). So I have two overcards (K and Q) to a 6-high board. Backdoor flush draw? I have Ks, so I have a spade, but need two more spades for flush. Actually board has 6s and 4s, so there are two spades on board. I have Ks, so I have a flush draw: three spades on board plus my Ks gives me a flush draw! Wait: board has 6s and 4s (two spades). I have Ks, so I have a spade. That's a flush draw! I need two more spades on turn and river. Actually, I have a flush draw: I need one more spade to make a flush (since I have one spade, board has two spades,",

My equity against likely hands: I have ~30-40% against a pair like 77-TT, and better against draws. However, there are two opponents: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is short-stacked and likely all-in or nearly all-in with their bet of 30 (they have 28 chips). Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called the 30.

          "content": "Now, let's analyze the current hand:\n\nWe're on the turn. Board: 3h 6s 4s 5d. Our hand: Qd Ks.\n\nWe have KQ offsuit. Board is 3-6-4-5 rainbow (no flush draws). The board is very connected with many straight possibilities. The 5d turn completes some straights (2-7, 7-8, 2-6? Actually 2-7 would be a straight with 3-4-5-6-7, and 7-8 would be 4-5-6-7-8).\n\nWe have two overcards (K and Q) but no pair. We have a gutshot straight draw: we need a 7 to complete a straight (3-4-5-6-7). That's 4 outs.\n\nPot is 302 chips. We have 254 chips left. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) went all-in on flop with 28 chips. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 154 chips and called our flop raise.\n\nWe checked flop, Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, we raised to 90 (total), Seat 4 called 28 all-in, Seat 5 called 60 more.\n\nNow on turn, action is on us. Amount to call is 0. We can check or raise.\n\nOur hand is weak: just two overcards and a gutshot. However, we have position (SB but heads-up vs GPT-OSS-120B now that Seat 4 is all-in). Actually, Seat 4 is all-in, so there's a side pot between us and Seat 5.\n\nWe need to consider what hands GPT-OSS-120B could have. He called preflop, called flop bet, called our raise. He could have a pair, a draw, or maybe a made straight.\n\nLooking at his tendencies: From the search, he seems to fold to aggression sometimes. But he called our flop raise, so he has something.\n\nOur flop raise was quite strong (90 into 120 pot?). Let's calculate: Preflop pot was maybe 48? Actually: SB 4, BB 8, Seat 4 call 8, Seat 5 call 8, Seat 1 fold, we raise 20 (total 28?), then Seat 4 call 12, Seat 5 call 12. So preflop pot: 4+8+8+8+20+12+12 = 72? Wait, let's recalc: SB posts 4, BB posts 8, Seat 4 calls 8, Seat 5 calls 8 = 28. Then we raise 20 more (so total we put in 28), Seat 4 calls 12 more (total 20), Seat 5 calls 12 more (total 20). So pot = 4+8+8+8+20+12+12 = 72. Yes.\n\nFlop: We check, Seat 4 bets 30, Seat 5 calls 30, pot now 132. We raise to 90 (total). That's a raise of 60 more (since we need to call 30 then raise). Pot becomes 132+90 = 222? Actually our raise adds 60 to pot, so pot = 132+60 = 192. Then Seat 4 calls 28 all-in, Seat 5 calls 60 more. So pot main pot: 72+30+30+90+28+60 = 310? Let's not overcomplicate.\n\nNow turn: pot is 302 chips. We have 254 left.\n\nIf we check, GPT-OSS-120B might bet. He has 154 chips total. He might bet with a strong hand or a draw.\n\nOur gutshot gives us 4 outs to a straight. That's about 8.7% equity (4/46). But we also have overcard outs: K or Q might be good if he has a smaller pair. But on this board, many pairs are possible: 6x, 5x, 4x, 3x, or overpairs like 77-AA. Our KQ might be ahead if he has a draw like 7x or 8x.\n\nActually, we have 6 outs if we count K and Q as clean (maybe not clean if he has AK or AQ). So maybe 6 outs = 13%. But we need to discount.\n\nGiven the connected board, our hand is marginal. We have position for river if we check now. We can check and evaluate river.\n\nIf we bet, we could try to take it down with a semi-bluff. But we'd be committing chips with weak equity.\n\nLet's think about stack sizes: We have "

          "reasoning_content": "Now, let's analyze the current hand:\n\nWe're on the turn. Board: 3h 6s 4s 5d. Our hand: Qd Ks.\n\nWe have KQ offsuit. Board is 3-6-4-5 rainbow (no flush draws). The board is very connected with many straight possibilities. The 5d turn completes some straights (2-7, 7-8, 2-6? Actually 2-7 would be a straight with 3-4-5-6-7, and 7-8 would be 4-5-6-7-8).\n\nWe have two overcards (K and Q) but no pair. We have a gutshot straight draw: we need a 7 to complete a straight (3-4-5-6-7). That's 4 outs.\n\nPot is 302 chips. We have 254 chips left. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) went all-in on flop with 28 chips. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 154 chips and called our flop raise.\n\nWe checked flop, Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, we raised to 90 (total), Seat 4 called 28 all-in, Seat 5 called 60 more.\n\nNow on turn, action is on us. Amount to call is 0. We can check or raise.\n\nOur hand is weak: just two overcards and a gutshot. However, we have position (SB but heads-up vs GPT-OSS-120B now that Seat 4 is all-in). Actually, Seat 4 is all-in, so there's a side pot between us and Seat 5.\n\nWe need to consider what hands GPT-OSS-120B could have. He called preflop, called flop bet, called our raise. He could have a pair, a draw, or maybe a made straight.\n\nLooking at his tendencies: From the search, he seems to fold to aggression sometimes. But he called our flop raise, so he has something.\n\nOur flop raise was quite strong (90 into 120 pot?). Let's calculate: Preflop pot was maybe 48? Actually: SB 4, BB 8, Seat 4 call 8, Seat 5 call 8, Seat 1 fold, we raise 20 (total 28?), then Seat 4 call 12, Seat 5 call 12. So preflop pot: 4+8+8+8+20+12+12 = 72? Wait, let's recalc: SB posts 4, BB posts 8, Seat 4 calls 8, Seat 5 calls 8 = 28. Then we raise 20 more (so total we put in 28), Seat 4 calls 12 more (total 20), Seat 5 calls 12 more (total 20). So pot = 4+8+8+8+20+12+12 = 72. Yes.\n\nFlop: We check, Seat 4 bets 30, Seat 5 calls 30, pot now 132. We raise to 90 (total). That's a raise of 60 more (since we need to call 30 then raise). Pot becomes 132+90 = 222? Actually our raise adds 60 to pot, so pot = 132+60 = 192. Then Seat 4 calls 28 all-in, Seat 5 calls 60 more. So pot main pot: 72+30+30+90+28+60 = 310? Let's not overcomplicate.\n\nNow turn: pot is 302 chips. We have 254 left.\n\nIf we check, GPT-OSS-120B might bet. He has 154 chips total. He might bet with a strong hand or a draw.\n\nOur gutshot gives us 4 outs to a straight. That's about 8.7% equity (4/46). But we also have overcard outs: K or Q might be good if he has a smaller pair. But on this board, many pairs are possible: 6x, 5x, 4x, 3x, or overpairs like 77-AA. Our KQ might be ahead if he has a draw like 7x or 8x.\n\nActually, we have 6 outs if we count K and Q as clean (maybe not clean if he has AK or AQ). So maybe 6 outs = 13%. But we need to discount.\n\nGiven the connected board, our hand is marginal. We have position for river if we check now. We can check and evaluate river.\n\nIf we bet, we could try to take it down with a semi-bluff. But we'd be committing chips with weak equity.\n\nLet's think about stack sizes: We have ",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to output JSON. Let me think through the decision clearly.\n\nCurrent situation: Turn, board 3h 6s 4s 5d, hand Qd Ks. Pot 302 chips. We have 254 chips left. Opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) has 154 chips. Seat 4 is all-in.\n\nWe can check or raise. No call needed since amount to call is 0.\n\nOur hand: KQo, no pair, gutshot to 7 for straight (3-4-5-6-7). That's 4 outs. Overcards might be good but doubtful on this board.\n\nWe raised flop aggressively. That might have been a semi-bluff or for value? Actually with KQ high on 3-6-4 board, raising was likely a semi-bluff or trying to take it down. Now turn is 5d, completing some straights.\n\nIf we check, opponent might bet with his range. He called flop raise, so he likely has something: maybe a pair, a draw, or a straight. He has only 154 chips left, so if he bets, he might go all-in.\n\nIf we raise now, we'd be committing more chips with weak equity. Minimum raise to 60 (total). But we could also go all-in.\n\nPot odds if we check-call a bet: If opponent bets all-in 154, pot becomes 302+154=456, we need to call 154. That's about 2.96:1 odds, needing ~25% equity. We likely don't have that.\n\nBetter to check and see what opponent does. If he checks behind, we get a free river. If he bets small, we might call if we think we have enough equity. But with only 4 clean outs (7s) and maybe 3 Ks and 3 Qs if they're good (but likely not), we have maybe 10 outs max = ~22% equity. That's close to break-even.\n\nBut tournament considerations: We have 31.8 BB stack. Not desperate. Seat 4 is all-in, so we're already guaranteed some side pot action.\n\nI think checking is best. Then evaluate river. If opponent bets, we can fold unless we improve.\n\nSo action: check.",

I'm in SB, opponent is GPT-OSS-120B with 154 chips. There's no bet to call (amount to call is 0), so I can check or raise.\n\nLet me think about the hand history: preflop I raised from BB (after posting BB) with Qd Ks to 20 total (so raise of 12 more). Two callers: seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) who is now out, and seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). Flop: 3h 6s 4s. I checked, seat 4 bet 30, seat 5 called, I raised to 90 total (so raise of 60 more). Seat 4 called 28 (all-in? stack was 0? Actually seat 4 had 0 chips after call? Wait seat 4 had 0 chips listed at start but they called preflop and flop bet... Actually seat 4 had 0 chips at start of hand? The table shows seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (out). That means they were already out? But they acted preflop and flop... Maybe they went all-in earlier? Let's see: preflop seat 4 call 8, then seat 3 raise 20, seat 4 call 12 (so they put in 20 total). Flop: seat 4 bet 30, seat 5 call 30, seat 3 raise 90, seat 4 call 28. That would be 28 more, total 58? Actually they bet 30, then called 28 more, so total 58. They must have had 58 chips? But they show 0 chips at start. Possibly they were all-in earlier? Anyway seat 4 is now out, so only seat 5 remains.\n\nTurn: I checked, seat 5 checked. River is 4d, board now 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So board pairs the 4. I have Qd Ks, no pair, just king high with queen kicker. However, the board shows 3-4-5-6 with two 4s, so there's a possible straight: 2-3-4-5-6 or 3-4-5-6-7. But the board has 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d, so straight possibilities: 2-3-4-5-6 (needs a 2) or 3-4-5-6-7 (needs a 7). No 2 or 7 on board. So no straight on board. My hand doesn't connect at all; I have king high. The flush possibilities: spades and diamonds. Board has 6s 4s (two spades), and 4d (diamond). I have Qd Ks, so I have king of spades and queen of diamonds. That gives me the second nut spade flush draw? Actually board has two spades, I have Ks, so I have the king-high spade flush draw. But there's no flush on board because only two spades. Diamonds: board has 4d, I have Qd, so only one diamond. No flush.\n\nWhat could opponent have? They called preflop, called flop bet, called my raise on flop, checked turn. They have 154 chips left. They might have a pair, maybe a straight draw, maybe a flush draw. The flop was 3h 6s 4s, so possible hands: pocket pairs, maybe 5x, maybe spade draws. Turn was 5d, completing possible straight if they had 7x or 2x. But they checked turn, so maybe they don't have a straight. River pairs the 4, which could improve some hands like trips if they had a 4, but unlikely.\n\nMy flop raise was large: I raised to 90 after check-raising. That's a strong move representing a strong hand. I have Qd Ks, which is not strong, but I was likely semi-bluffing with overcards and spade draw. Now on river, I have king high. The pot is 302 chips. I have 254 chips left. Opponent has 154 chips left. If I bet, I could try to bluff representing a strong hand like a set or two pair that improved to full house on river? But the river paired the board, so if I had a 4, I now have trips or full house. However, my line:"

I'm in SB, opponent is GPT-OSS-120B with 154 chips. There's no bet to call (amount to call is 0), so I can check or raise.\n\nLet me think about the hand history: preflop I raised from BB (after posting BB) with Qd Ks to 20 total (so raise of 12 more). Two callers: seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) who is now out, and seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). Flop: 3h 6s 4s. I checked, seat 4 bet 30, seat 5 called, I raised to 90 total (so raise of 60 more). Seat 4 called 28 (all-in? stack was 0? Actually seat 4 had 0 chips after call? Wait seat 4 had 0 chips listed at start but they called preflop and flop bet... Actually seat 4 had 0 chips at start of hand? The table shows seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (out). That means they were already out? But they acted preflop and flop... Maybe they went all-in earlier? Let's see: preflop seat 4 call 8, then seat 3 raise 20, seat 4 call 12 (so they put in 20 total). Flop: seat 4 bet 30, seat 5 call 30, seat 3 raise 90, seat 4 call 28. That would be 28 more, total 58? Actually they bet 30, then called 28 more, so total 58. They must have had 58 chips? But they show 0 chips at start. Possibly they were all-in earlier? Anyway seat 4 is now out, so only seat 5 remains.\n\nTurn: I checked, seat 5 checked. River is 4d, board now 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So board pairs the 4. I have Qd Ks, no pair, just king high with queen kicker. However, the board shows 3-4-5-6 with two 4s, so there's a possible straight: 2-3-4-5-6 or 3-4-5-6-7. But the board has 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d, so straight possibilities: 2-3-4-5-6 (needs a 2) or 3-4-5-6-7 (needs a 7). No 2 or 7 on board. So no straight on board. My hand doesn't connect at all; I have king high. The flush possibilities: spades and diamonds. Board has 6s 4s (two spades), and 4d (diamond). I have Qd Ks, so I have king of spades and queen of diamonds. That gives me the second nut spade flush draw? Actually board has two spades, I have Ks, so I have the king-high spade flush draw. But there's no flush on board because only two spades. Diamonds: board has 4d, I have Qd, so only one diamond. No flush.\n\nWhat could opponent have?

Pot is 302 chips. I have 254 chips. Opponent has 154 chips. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand is weak - just king high. But I raised preflop and check-raised flop, representing strength. The river paired the board, which could have improved my hand if I had a 4 (trips) or a full house if I had a pocket pair. My line looks strong: raise preflop, check-raise flop, check turn (maybe trapping). On river, I could bet to represent a strong hand.\n\nOpponent called flop raise and checked turn. They might have a marginal hand like a pair or a draw that missed. They have 154 chips left, pot is 302. If I bet, I could try to get them to fold.\n\nHowever, if I bet and they call, I lose chips. My hand is literally king high, no pair. The board is low cards with a pair of 4s. They could have a pair of 5s, 6s, or a 4. They called flop raise, so they have something.\n\nLet me consider pot odds: If I bet, say 100 chips (about 1/3 pot), they need to call 100 to win 402 (pot 302 + my bet 100). That's about 4:1 odds. They might call with any pair. If I go all-in (254 chips), they need to call 254 to win 556, about 2.2:1. They'd probably call with any decent hand.\n\nMy image: I've been aggressive. But my hand is weak. Checking seems weak too, but maybe I can get a free showdown with king high. If I check, they might bet with any hand, and I'd have to fold. But they checked turn, so maybe they're weak too.\n\nI should check and hope they check behind. If they bet, I can fold. That seems reasonable. I don't want to bluff into a possible calling station.\n\nBut let me recall opponent tendencies. Use tool.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to make a decision. I'm on the river with king high, board is 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. I have Qd Ks. The pot is 302 chips. I have 254 chips left, opponent has 154 chips left. I checked turn, opponent checked. Now on river, I have the option to check or raise (bet). Since amount to call is 0, I can check for free.\n\nMy hand is very weak - just king high. However, I raised preflop and check-raised the flop aggressively. That represents strength. The river paired the board with 4d, which could improve some hands but also makes it less likely opponent has a 4 (only one left). My line could represent a hand like AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, or a set that improved to full house. But I actually have KQ offsuit.\n\nOpponent called flop raise and checked turn. They might have a medium pair, a draw that missed, or a weak hand. They have 154 chips left, less than half the pot. If I bet, I could try to bluff them off a better hand. But they only need to call 154 chips to win 302+154=456 pot? Actually if I bet, I need to decide bet size. Minimum raise to is 60, but I can bet any amount up to my stack.\n\nIf I bet, say 100 chips (about 1/3 pot), they need to call 100 to win 402 (302+100). That's about 4:1 odds. They might call with any pair. If I go all-in (254), they need to call 254 to win 556 (302+254). That's about 2.2:1 odds. They might call with any decent hand.\n\nGiven my weak hand, checking seems safer. But I have position (I act first? Actually I'm SB, so I act first on river? Wait, the action shows: turn: Seat 3 check, turn: Seat 5 check. Now river, I'm seat 3 (SB), so I act first. I can check, then opponent can bet. If I check and opponent bets, I'll have to decide whether to call. But opponent checked turn, so they might not bet river either.\n\nChecking seems reasonable: I have a weak hand, I've shown aggression earlier, but I might get a free showdown. If opponent bets, I can fold. If opponent checks behind, I might win if they have worse. But king high is not likely to win at showdown.\n\nHowever, given my aggressive line, I could try a bluff bet on river. The board is scary: straight and flush draws missed, board paired. I could represent a full house or trips. But opponent called flop raise, so they might have something. They have only 154 chips left, so they might be pot-committed if they call.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 254 chips (31.8 BB). That's a decent stack. Opponent has 154 chips (19.25 BB). If I bluff and get called, I lose significant chips. If I check and lose, I still have 254 chips. If I bluff and succeed, I win 302 chips, increasing to 556 chips (69.5 BB) which would be huge.\n\nBut the risk is high. My hand is king high, which might actually be good if opponent has nothing. They might have missed draws like spade flush draw, straight draw. The board has 4d, which pairs the board, but doesn't complete any obvious draws.\n\nI'll check and hope they check behind.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this hand. I'm on the button with 4d8d. My stack is 250 chips (31.2 BB). Blinds are 4/8. Pot is 230 chips. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 218, which is an all-in since they have 0 chips? Wait, Seat 5 has 0 chips and is marked as \"out\". That seems odd. Maybe they're already out of the tournament? Actually, looking at the players: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). So they're out of the tournament, but somehow they raised? That doesn't make sense. Perhaps it's a mistake in the display. Let me read carefully: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out)\". Yet the action says \"Seat 5 raise 218\". That seems contradictory. Maybe they had 218 chips and went all-in? But it says 0 chips. Hmm.\n\nAnyway, the pot is 230 chips. Seat 1 folded. I'm Seat 3 (button). I posted SB 4, Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted BB 8. Then Seat 5 raised to 218. I need to call 214 to win a pot of 230 + 218 = 448? Wait, let's calculate: Pot before Seat 5's raise: SB 4 + BB 8 = 12. Seat 5 raised to 218 total, which means they added 210 more (since BB is 8, they need to raise at least to 16, but they raised huge). The pot after their raise: 4 (SB) + 8 (BB) + 218 = 230. That matches the pot listed: 230 chips. So I need to call 214 (since I already put in 4 as SB). If I call, I put in 214 more, making total pot 230 + 214 = 444. But actually, Seat 4 (BB) still hasn't acted. They will act after me. They have 226 chips. They could call or fold.\n\nMy hand: 4d8d suited. Very weak hand. Facing a huge raise that looks like an all-in (though Seat 5 has 0 chips? Maybe they're all-in with 218 and have 0 left). The raise is 27.25 BB (218/8). That's a massive raise, typically indicating a very strong hand. With 4d8d, I should almost certainly fold. However, I need to consider pot odds. I need to call 214 to win 230. That's about 1.07:1 odds, meaning I need about 48% equity. 4d8s vs a strong range has maybe 30% equity at best. So fold.\n\nBut wait, there's also Seat 4 behind me who could call or raise. If I call, they might also call or raise. That could change pot odds. However, with such a weak hand, I should fold.\n\nI should also consider tournament situation: I have 250 chips (31.2 BB). That's healthy. No need to gamble with 4d8d.\n\nLet me check if there's any history on Seat 5's behavior. Use recall_opponent_actions for Seat 5.",

Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 218, which is effectively an all-in since they have 0 chips? Wait, Seat 5 shows 0 chips and is marked as \"out\" in the player list. But the action says Seat 5 raise 218. That seems contradictory. Let me check the player list again: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). Yet the action says \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 218\". That would be impossible if they have 0 chips. Maybe it's a misprint or they had chips earlier? The pot is 230 chips, which suggests SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 218 = 230. So indeed Seat 5 raised 218 total.\n\nBut Seat 5 is shown as having 0 chips and \"out\". Perhaps they went all-in on a previous hand and lost, but this is a new hand? Or maybe the \"out\" means they're sitting out? Let me re-read: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out)\". Could mean they're out of the tournament, but then they wouldn't be able to raise. Possibly a display error.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide: fold or call with 4d8d. I have to call 214 chips to win a pot of 230 + my call 214 = 444 total. So I'm getting about 2.07:1 pot odds (444/214). My stack is 250, calling 214 leaves me with 36 chips if I lose. That's desperate.\n\nHand strength: 4d8d suited is a weak hand. Against a huge raise like this, likely a strong hand. Could be a pair, high cards, maybe AK, AQ, JJ+, etc. My equity against a reasonable range is poor.\n\nTournament situation: I have 31.2 BB, which is okay but not deep. Losing this would cripple me to 4.5 BB. However, doubling up would give me 500 chips (62.5 BB). Risk vs reward.\n\nBut wait, Seat 5 has 0 chips? That's confusing. If they actually have 0 chips, their raise is invalid. Maybe they have 218 chips but display shows 0? Let me search for observations about Seat 5.\n\nI should use the search tool to see if there are any hands involving Seat 5.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this hand situation. I'm on the button with 4d8d, which is a weak hand. There's been a raise from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) who raised to 218 chips, which is effectively all-in since they have 0 chips? Wait, the table shows GPT-OSS-120B has 0 chips and is marked as \"out\". That seems confusing. Let me re-read: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). But the actions say \"Seat 5 raise 218\". That doesn't make sense if they have 0 chips. Maybe it's a misprint or they're actually all-in? \n\nActually, looking at the pot: it's 230 chips. Blinds are 4/8. I posted SB 4, Seat 4 posted BB 8. That's 12 chips. Then Seat 5 raised 218, making total pot 230. So Seat 5 must have had at least 218 chips. But the table says 0 chips. This is inconsistent.\n\nRegardless, I need to make a decision. I have 250 chips total, 31.2 BB. Amount to call is 214 chips, which would leave me with only 36 chips if I call. That's a huge portion of my stack - about 85% of it.\n\nMy hand is 4d8d suited, which is very weak. Even suited connectors need better odds to call. The pot odds: I need to call 214 to win 230 + 214 = 444? Actually, pot is 230, I call 214, total pot would be 444. So I'm getting about 1:1 odds (214 to win 230, actually 214 to win 230? Wait, pot is 230 now, I call 214, pot becomes 444, my share is 214/444 = 48%. I need about 48% equity to break even.\n\nWith 4d8d against a likely strong raising range, I have nowhere near 48% equity. Even against a wide range, 4d8s is around 30-35% equity at best. Against a tight range, it's worse.\n\nPosition: I'm on the button, which is good, but I'm facing a huge raise that commits most of my stack. If I call, I'll be playing for my tournament life with a weak hand.\n\nTournament considerations: With 31.2 BB, I have a decent stack. Folding leaves me with 250 chips (31.2 BB). Calling and losing would leave me with 36 chips (4.5 BB) and basically crippled.\n\nI should check opponent tendencies, but the tool calls are failing due to format issues. However, even without that information, this is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, the price is too high, and I'd be risking most of my stack with poor equity.\n\nLet me think about the raise size: 218 into a 12 chip pot is a massive overbet. This suggests either a very strong hand or a bluff. But with my weak holding, I can't afford to find out.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop situation. I'm on the button with 5h8h, which is a suited connector but weak. Stack is 250 chips (31.2 BB). Blinds are 4/8. Only SB (MiniMax-M2, 222 chips) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B, 222 chips) are left to act after me. UTG folded.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has been mostly calling preflop (calls 4-8 chips), folded twice when facing larger bets. In hand 45, called 8 then 12 preflop, then bet 30 on flop.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): More aggressive. In hand 46, raised to 218 preflop (all-in). Also bets postflop.\n\nMy hand 5h8h is weak but suited and connected. On button, I have position advantage. However, with only 31.2 BB, I should be careful. Suited connectors can play well postflop but need good pot odds.\n\nPot is 12 chips (4+8). I need to call 8 to see flop. That's getting 1.5:1 pot odds. If I call, SB may complete (call additional 4) or raise. BB may check or raise.\n\nGiven my position and stack size, folding is reasonable with such a weak hand. However, suited connectors can make strong draws. But with shallow stacks, implied odds aren't great.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I've been playing somewhat aggressively (raised with QhJh, Kd4d, QdKs). Lost some chips. Need to preserve stack.\n\nBetter to fold this weak hand and wait for better spots. 5h8h is bottom of my range even on button with shallow stacks.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

The pot is 12 chips (SB+BB). Minimum raise is to 16 chips (double the BB).\n\nWith AA, I want to get value but also not scare everyone away. A standard raise would be 3-4x BB, so 24-32 chips. However, given the aggressive tendencies I've seen (especially from GPT-OSS-120B who made a huge 218-chip raise recently), I might consider a larger raise to isolate or build a big pot.\n\nBut I'm in UTG, so there are many players left to act. A standard raise of 24-28 chips seems appropriate. If I raise too small, I might get too many callers. If I raise too big, I might only get the blinds or get 3-bet by someone with a strong hand.\n\nLet me think about stack sizes:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB): 252 chips\n- MiniMax-M2: 218 chips  \n- GPT-OSS-120B (SB): 234 chips\n\nAll stacks are similar to mine. A raise to 24-28 chips (3-3.5x) would be about 10% of my stack, leaving room for post-flop play.\n\nGiven that I have the best possible starting hand, I should raise to build the pot.

I should bet for value with my pocket Aces. The board has draws (flush draw, straight draws) and possible trips (Jx). A bet protects my hand and gets value from weaker holdings.\n\nStandard bet sizing would be 40-50 chips (60-75% of pot). I'll go with 48 chips, which is about 70% of pot. This is a reasonable continuation bet after my preflop raise.\n\nMy action is \"raise\" since I'm making the first bet on the flop. The \"raise_to\" should be the total amount I'm putting in. I already have 8 chips in from the BB, plus I raised preflop to 28 total. Wait, I need to think about the current pot and my contribution.\n\nActually, looking at the hand history: I'm in BB (Seat 3). Preflop: Seat 5 posted SB 4, Seat 1 posted BB 8, I raised to 28 from BB, Seat 4 called 28, others folded.\n\nSo I have 28 chips in the pot already (my preflop raise). The pot is 68 chips total. Now on the flop, I'm first to act. If I bet, I need to specify the total amount I want to put in. Since I have 28 chips in already, if I want to bet 48 chips total, that means I need to add 20 more chips (48 - 28 = 20). But actually, when betting on a new street, we usually think of the bet amount as additional chips beyond what's already in.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"If raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount).\" So if I want to bet 48 chips total, I should set raise_to: 48.\n\nWait, but I already have 28 chips in. So to get to 48 total, I'd be adding 20 more. That seems like a small bet relative to the pot (20 into 68 = ~30% pot). That might be too small.\n\nLet me recalculate: Pot is 68 chips. If I bet 48 chips as a total amount, that means I'm adding 20 chips to my existing 28. That's a 20 chip bet into 68 pot = 29% pot. That's on the small side.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of bet size relative to pot. A standard continuation bet is 50-75% of pot. 50% of 68 = 34 chips. 75% = 51 chips. So I should be adding 34-51 chips beyond my existing 28.\n\nIf I want to bet 50% pot, I'd put in 28 + 34 = 62 total. If I want 75% pot, I'd put in 28 + 51 = 79 total.\n\nI have 222 chips total. Betting 62 total (adding 34) leaves me with 188. Betting 79 total (adding 51) leaves me with 171. Both are reasonable.\n\nI'll go with a 75% pot bet, which is 79 chips total. That's aggressive but appropriate with Aces on this board.\n\nActually wait, I need to check the minimum raise. The prompt says \"Minimum raise to: 20\". That means the smallest bet I can make is 20 chips total? Or 20 chips more than whatever is currently in?\n\nThe instructions: \"Minimum raise to: 20\" likely means the total amount I need to raise to is at least 20. Since I already have 28 in, I can't bet less than 20 total, which would mean I'd have to remove chips. That doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, in poker, when you're first to act on a new street, the minimum bet is usually the big blind (8 chips here). But there might be specific tournament rules. Given \"Minimum raise to: 20\", I think that means if I want to raise (bet), the total amount must be at least 20 chips. Since I have 28 already in, I need to bet at least 20 total, which I already exceed. So I can bet any amount from 20 up.\n\nI'll bet 79 chips total (adding 51 more). That's a strong continuation bet.\n\nReasoning: With pocket Aces on Kd Jh Jd board, need to bet for value and protection. Many hands that called preflop (KQ, QJ, JT, flush draws) will call this bet. Also charges draws appropriately. Sizing at 75% pot is standard for continuation bets.\n\nLet me provide the JSON.",

I have pocket Aces on a Kd Jh Jd board. I want to bet for value. Since there's no bet to call, I should use \"raise\" to make a bet. The \"raise_to\" should be the total amount I'm putting in. Currently I have 222 chips. If I want to bet 48 chips, that means my total bet would be 48 chips (since there's nothing in there yet from me on this street). Actually wait, I'm the big blind and I already put in 28 chips preflop. On the flop, I haven't put anything yet. So if I bet 48 chips, that means I'm adding 48 chips to the pot, making my total contribution to the pot 28 + 48 = 76 chips. But the \"raise_to\" field should be the total amount I'm putting in for this street. Since I haven't put anything on the flop yet, \"raise_to\" should be 48.\n\nBut let me think about the rules: \"If raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\". For a bet on the flop when facing no bet, the total amount I'm putting in would be the bet size. So yes, raise_to: 48.\n\nActually, I should consider pot size and stack sizes more carefully. Pot is 68 chips. My stack is 222 chips. A bet of 48 chips is about 70% of pot. That seems reasonable. Could also go smaller like 40 chips or larger like 55 chips. 48 is fine.\n\nReasoning should be brief explanation.\n\nSo final JSON: {\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 48,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Betting for value with pocket Aces on Kd Jh Jd board. Need to charge draws (flush and straight) and get value from Kx hands. 48 chips (~70% pot) is a good sizing to achieve both objectives.\"\n}\n\nWait, should I check instead? No, with Aces I should bet. Could check-raise? But I'm out of position (BB) and opponent is in position relative to me. Actually, I'm BB and opponent is... let me check positions. Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2. I'm Seat 3 (BB). So I acted first preflop, and now I'm first to act on flop. I'm out of position. That makes betting even more important to control the pot and not give free cards.\n\nYes, betting is correct.",

          "content": "I need to analyze this situation carefully. I'm in the BB with Kd Jh facing a raise from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) to 24 total (16 more to call). The pot is currently 36 chips (8 BB + 4 SB + 24 raise).\n\nLooking at opponent data: Seat 5 has shown some aggression recently. In hand #47, they raised to 24 from an earlier position. In hand #46, they went all-in for 218. They also called with pocket 8s in hand #45 and showed down. They seem to be playing a mix of hands.\n\nMy hand: KJo is decent but not great, especially out of position. However, I'm getting good pot odds: 16 to call into a pot of 52 (36 current + 16 my call), which is about 3.25:1. That's reasonable.\n\nMy stack is 282 chips (35.2 BB), which is healthy. Seat 5 has 210 chips (26.25 BB). I have position disadvantage being OOP, but I could consider a 3-bet to take initiative.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold - KJo OOP isn't great, but pot odds are good\n2. Call - See a flop with decent odds, but play OOP\n3. Raise - 3-bet to apply pressure, potentially take it down preflop\n\nIf I raise, minimum is 40 total (32 more). That would be a raise to 2.5x their raise, which is reasonable.\n\nConsidering opponent tendencies: They've shown they can fold (many folds in early hands), but also can be aggressive. They might fold to a 3-bet with marginal hands.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack and don't want to risk too much unnecessarily, but accumulating chips is important.\n\nI think a 3-bet could be good here. KJo has decent equity against their raising range, and a 3-bet might get them to fold many hands that have me dominated (like KQ, AJ, etc.). If they call, I have position on flop (actually wait, I'm BB, they're button? Let me check: Seat 5 is button? Actually positions: Seat 1 was SB, Seat 3 is me BB, Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 raised. So Seat 5 is cutoff or button? Need to check seating: Seat 1, 2, 3 (me), 4, 5. With 5 players, positions would be: SB (seat 1), BB (me seat 3), UTG (seat 4), MP (seat 5). Actually wait, that doesn't make sense with only 5 players. Let me think: Seat 1 folded (was SB), Seat 2 folded, Seat 3 is me (BB), Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 raised. So Seat 5 is on the button! Yes, with 5 players: SB (1), BB (3), UTG (4), MP (5), BTN (5 actually no...). Actually with 5 players: SB, BB, UTG, MP, BTN. Seat 4 was UTG, Seat 5 is MP. So I'm OOP against MP.\n\nGiven I'm OOP, that makes calling less attractive. A 3-bet could take control.\n\nI'll 3-bet to about 60-70 total. Let's do 64 total (raise to 56 more, making it 64 total). That's 2.67x their raise. Reasonable sizing.\n\nIf they 4-bet, I can fold. If they call, I can c-bet on favorable flops.\n\nActually, let me check my stack: 282 chips. Raising to 64 leaves me 218 behind. That's reasonable.\n\nDecision: 3-bet to 64."

Even if called, position allows us to play postflop well with initiative.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the button (BTN) with 8h7d. This is a suited connector (8\u26657\u2666 - actually offsuit, not suited). I have 314 chips (39.2 BB). The blinds are 4/8. I posted the small blind of 4, and MiniMax-M2 posted the big blind of 8. Everyone else folded.\n\nI need to call 4 chips to complete the bet (since I already posted 4 as SB, and the BB is 8, so I need to add 4 more).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB) has 182 chips. From the data, I see they tend to call preflop often but haven't shown any raises preflop. They've folded to raises several times. They seem somewhat passive.\n\nMy hand: 8h7d is a weak hand, but being on the button with only the BB to act behind me gives me positional advantage. This is a classic steal opportunity.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 12 chips (my 4 SB + BB's 8). That's 3:1 pot odds (25% equity needed). Even with 87o, I have decent equity against a random BB hand.\n\nHowever, I could also raise to try to steal the blinds. The minimum raise is to 16 total (8 more than the current bet of 8). My stack is healthy at 39.2 BB.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack, but not huge. Stealing blinds is important in tournament poker.\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 seems passive and hasn't raised preflop, a raise might take it down immediately. Even if called, I have position.\n\nBut 87o is quite weak. Let me think about standard button opening ranges. 87o is borderline - it's not great, but with position and against a likely weak BB range, it might be profitable.\n\nActually, looking at my own history: In hand #47, I folded 85h on the button in a similar situation. That was a slightly weaker hand (85s vs 87o). But position is valuable.\n\nI think the best play is to raise. If I just call, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position postflop (well actually I'm on button, so I have position). Wait, no - if I call, I'll be in position against the BB. That's good.\n\nBut raising has benefits: 1) Might win immediately, 2) Builds pot when I hit, 3) Takes initiative.\n\nI'll make a standard button raise. Let's say raise to 20-24 chips (2.5-3x BB). That's 16-20 more chips.\n\nActually, the minimum raise is to 16 total (double the BB). I could min-raise to 16, but that might not get enough folds. Better to raise to 20 or 24.\n\nI'll raise to 20 total (12 more chips). That's 2.5x BB.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 20,\n  \"reasoning\": \"On button with 87o against passive BB who hasn't shown preflop raises.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm on the button with A3 suited (clubs). This is a decent hand from the button - ace-rag suited has some potential for flushes and ace-high can win if no one has a better ace. I have 40.8 BB, which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 4/8. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted the small blind (4) and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted the big blind (8). Seat 1 folded. \n\nSo there are two players left to act: MiniMax-M2 (SB, 178 chips) and GPT-OSS-120B (BB, 202 chips). I'm on the button, which is the best position. \n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's actions: they seem to call sometimes preflop but also fold often. They called 28 chips with my AA hand (hand 48), then folded on the flop. They've folded the last few hands.\n\nThe pot is 12 chips (4+8). I need to call 8 to see the flop. With A3s, I could consider raising to take initiative and potentially win the blinds, or just call to see a flop cheaply. \n\nFrom the button, raising is standard with many hands, but A3s is marginal. However, with only the blinds left to act and my position advantage, a raise could be good. If I raise to say 24 (3x BB), that would be 24 total (16 more). That's reasonable with my stack.\n\nBut let me consider tournament implications: I have 40.8 BB, which is comfortable. The blinds have 22.25 BB and 25.25 BB respectively. They might be more cautious with their shorter stacks.\n\nActually, looking at my recent history: I've been raising from button with various hands (hand 50: 87o, hand 49: KJ, hand 48: AA). So I have an aggressive image.\n\nGiven that I have position and A3s has some potential, I think a small raise is reasonable. I'll raise to 24 (3x). This puts pressure on the blinds and allows me to potentially win the pot preflop or play postflop in position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A3s from button with position advantage.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm UTG (under the gun) with 7c 4d - a very weak hand. This is an offsuit, disconnected low cards - one of the worst starting hands in poker. I have 338 chips (42.2 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, seat 1): Has folded 10 consecutive times preflop. Seems very tight/passive.\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4): Has folded frequently but also called some raises. Showed aggression once with a bet on flop.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (SB, seat 5): Has been aggressive with raises preflop (hands 46, 47, 49), but folded recently in last 3 hands.\n\nPosition considerations: I'm UTG, which is the worst position. I have to act first after the flop, which makes playing weak hands difficult.\n\nMy hand: 7c 4d is terrible. It has no straight potential, no flush potential (offsuit), low cards that rarely make top pair. Even if I hit a pair, it's likely to be dominated.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 8 into a pot of 12 (20 after my call). That's 2.5:1 pot odds, but with such a weak hand and bad position, implied odds are poor.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (42.2 BB). No need to gamble with trash hands from early position.\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies, if I limp (call), I expect:\n- SB (GPT-OSS-120B) might raise, as they've shown aggression\n- BB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding constantly, but might check with any hand since they get to see a free flop\n\nBut even if it checks through, I'm playing 7-4 offsuit out of position against 3 opponents. This is a losing proposition.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for better spots. I'm chip leader at the table (338 vs others: 240, 178, 198). I can afford to be selective.\n\nDecision: Fold. This hand is unplayable from UTG.",

Offsuit with low cards, not connected, no straight potential. One of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n2. **Position:** We're out of position (BB vs single raiser). This makes playing postflop difficult.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has been raising preflop in some hands (hands 46, 47, 49) but also folding many hands recently (hands 48, 50, 51, 52). The recent pattern shows 4 consecutive folds preflop. The raise to 20 (2.5x) is a standard opening size.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** We need to call 12 to win 32, giving us 2.67:1 pot odds (27% equity needed). With J2o, we have ~32% equity against a typical opening range. However, this assumes we see all 5 cards, but we'll be out of position postflop.\n\n5. **Stack Sizes:** We have 330 chips (41 BB), opponent has 178 (22 BB). If we call and miss the flop, we'll face a continuation bet and likely have to fold. If we hit top pair with J, it's vulnerable.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** We have a healthy stack (41 BB). No need to gamble with weak hands. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n7. **Alternatives:** Raising is possible but would be a bluff with a terrible hand. Folding is the standard play.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. J2o is too weak to defend from the big blind against a single raise, especially out of position. The pot odds are decent but the hand has poor playability postflop. Better to wait for a better spot with our healthy stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"J2o is too weak to defend from BB against a single raise.

The other players folded. I need to call 4 chips to complete the blind, or I can raise to at least 16 chips total.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 seems fairly passive preflop. From the data, they've mostly folded or called, never raised preflop. They've called raises several times (hand 47, 48, 52) but tend to fold postflop if they don't hit. They have 182 chips (22.75 BB).\n\nWith pocket kings, this is an extremely strong hand preflop. I'm on the button with position advantage. The pot is currently 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8).\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Pocket kings is the second-best starting hand (only behind aces)\n2. I have position on the BB\n3. Opponent appears passive preflop\n4. I want to build the pot with this strong hand\n5. My stack is 326 vs opponent's 182\n\nI should definitely raise. The minimum raise is to 16 total (8 more). But with such a strong hand, I should make a larger raise to build the pot and potentially get all-in preflop against a weaker hand. Given the stacks, I could raise to around 24-32 chips (3-4x BB). This would be a standard raise size and put pressure on the BB.\n\nIf I raise to 24 total (20 more), that's 2.5x the BB. That seems reasonable. If opponent calls, the pot will be 44 chips going to the flop, and I'll have position.\n\nLet's raise to 24.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this preflop situation. I'm on the button with 9s Th (9 of spades, 10 of hearts). This is a suited connector, but not a great one - it's 9-10 offsuit actually (since 9s and Th are different suits). So it's 9-10 offsuit, which is a marginal hand.\n\nMy stack is 338 chips (42.2 BB), which is healthy. The blinds are 4/8, so I have to call 8 chips to see the flop.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is the small blind. They've been folding a lot preflop (6/10 times), calling twice, and once they called 8 and then bet 8 on flop. They seem somewhat tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is the big blind. They've been raising preflop frequently (4/10 times raised, including one all-in for 218), and folding other times. They seem aggressive.\n\nThe action: Seat 1 (UTG) folded, so it's folded to me on the button. I'm in late position with only the blinds left to act. This is a good stealing opportunity.\n\nWith 9-10 offsuit, it's not a premium hand, but from the button with folds in front, I have good position. The pot is 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8). Calling 8 gives me 1.5:1 pot odds, but more importantly, I have position advantage.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I have a healthy stack, and stealing blinds can be profitable. However, 9-10 offsuit is weak and doesn't play well postflop. A raise might be better to try to take it down preflop.\n\nLooking at the BB's tendencies: they've raised preflop 4 times out of 10, so they're aggressive. If I just call, they might raise behind me. If I raise, they might call or re-raise.\n\nActually, let me check my own recent history: I've been raising from late positions and winning pots preflop (hand #50, 51, 54). This suggests my table image might be aggressive.\n\nGiven my position and the fact that it's folded to me, a raise is standard here. The minimum raise is to 16 total (8 more). I could raise to 20-24 (2.5-3x BB).\n\nHowever, 9-10 offsuit is quite weak. Maybe a fold is better? But folding from the button with only blinds left seems too tight. At least calling to see a flop in position might be okay.\n\nActually, let me think about hand strength: 9-10 offsuit has some straight potential but is otherwise weak. It's easily dominated by better tens or nines. In tournament poker, preserving chips is important.\n\nBut I have position and a chance to steal. A small raise to 20-24 might work. If called, I can play cautiously postflop.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors: The SB has 178 chips (22.25 BB), BB has 202 chips (25.25 BB). They're both shorter than me, which might make them more willing to defend.\n\nDecision: I'll raise to try to steal the blinds. A standard 2.5x raise to 20 total (12 more). If called, I'll have position and can evaluate the flop.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 20,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Button position with folds ahead. 9-10 offsuit is marginal but raising to 20 (2.5x) attempts to steal blinds.

However, I'm getting decent pot odds: need to call 12 to win 32, which is 2.67:1 odds (27% equity needed).\n\nBut there are tournament considerations:\n- I have a healthy stack (42.8 BB)\n- Opponent has 174 chips (21.75 BB)\n- I'm out of position (BB vs CO)\n- 87o doesn't play well out of position\n\nLooking at my recent hands, I've been playing fairly tight, folding marginal hands preflop. This is a borderline spot. The opponent's raise sizing (2.5x) is standard, and given their fold-heavy tendency, they might have a decent but not premium hand.\n\nGiven that I'm out of position with a weak hand, and the opponent has shown some aggression (one previous raise), I think folding is correct here. The pot odds are tempting, but playing 87o out of position against a likely decent range is not optimal.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.",

The action:\n- I posted SB 4\n- MiniMax-M2 posted BB 8\n- GPT-OSS-120B raised to 24 from early position (Seat 5)\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking folded\n- Now it's on me\n\nPot is 36 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24). I need to call 20 chips.\n\nFrom opponent history:\n- GPT-OSS-120B has raised twice in recent hands (Hand 53 and 57), both to 20. This time raised to 24. Seems to be raising with a wider range.\n- MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot preflop (4 of last 5 hands).\n- I'm in position with 42BB stack, which is healthy.\n\nMy hand: K2 offsuit is weak. King-high with poor kicker. However, being on the button gives me positional advantage. If I call, MiniMax-M2 in BB might fold given their recent folding tendency.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 20 to win 36, so pot odds are 20:36 or 1:1.8, meaning I need ~35.7% equity. K2o vs a typical raising range has maybe 30% equity at best. But with position and potential to steal postflop if checked to me, it could be playable.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 42BB, which is a decent stack. GPT-OSS-120B has 182 chips (22.75BB). If I call and MiniMax-M2 folds, pot will be 56 chips and I'll have position on the raiser.\n\nHowever, K2o is really weak. Even with position, it's hard to play postflop without hitting something. And if MiniMax-M2 wakes up with a hand, I could be in trouble.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I've been raising with decent hands (KK, T9s) and folding weak ones. This fits the weak category.\n\nGiven the pot odds and position, some might consider a speculative call, but K2o is just too weak. The raiser could have a real hand, and I'll be out of position if MiniMax-M2 calls.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. My stack is healthy at 42BB, no need to gamble with such a weak hand.\n\nI should fold.",

The pot is 36 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24). I need to call 20 more chips.\n\nLooking at opponent's recent actions: In hand 57 (previous hand), they raised to 20 preflop. In hand 53, they raised to 20 preflop. They seem to be raising from late position occasionally. They've shown down some decent hands: KcAd (AK), KsQs (KQs), AdTs (ATs), 8h8c (pocket 8s). They're not overly loose but have shown some aggression.\n\nMy hand K2o is weak. King high with a weak kicker. On the button, I have position advantage, but K2o is a fold in most situations against a raise. The pot odds: I need to call 20 to win 56 (36 current + my 20). That's about 36% pot odds. K2o against a typical raising range has much less than 36% equity.\n\nMy stack is 338 chips (42 BB), which is healthy. Seat 5 has 182 chips (22.75 BB). They're shorter stacked. Folding preserves my stack. Calling with K2o out of position would be speculative at best. Even with position, K2o doesn't play well postflop unless I hit a strong hand.\n\nGiven the opponent's shown decent hands when they've shown down, and my weak holding, folding is correct.

Shows some showdown hands with decent cards (QQ, TT, AQs). Seems relatively tight.\n2. **Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)**: Also folds a lot preflop (10 of last 10 hands). Showdown hands include some marginal ones (8h2h, AdTs).\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- Q7o is a weak hand, especially from early position, but I'm on the button which is the best position\n- With both blinds already in, they have already invested chips\n- The pot is 12 chips, and it costs me 8 to call (pot odds: 12:8 = 1.5:1, or 40% equity needed)\n- With position, I can play postflop well\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (42 BB)\n- The blinds are small relative to my stack\n- Both opponents seem tight based on recent history\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven my position (button) and the fact that both blinds seem tight (folding a lot), this is a good spot to raise and try to steal the blinds. Q7o is not great, but with position and tight opponents, a raise could work.\n\nHowever, a raise commits more chips. Let me think about the alternatives:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight given my position and opponent tendencies\n2. **Call**: Gets me in cheap with position, but Q7o plays poorly multi-way\n3. **Raise**: Best option to take initiative and potentially win the pot preflop\n\nI should raise to 20-24 chips (2.5-3x BB). This is a standard raise size that pressures the blinds.\n\nLet me check if there's any history of these players defending blinds aggressively. From the data, both fold a lot, so they likely won't defend often."

Shows some showdown hands with decent cards (QQ, TT, AQs). Seems relatively tight.\n2. **Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)**: Also folds a lot preflop (10 of last 10 hands). Showdown hands include some marginal ones (8h2h, AdTs).\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- Q7o is a weak hand, especially from early position, but I'm on the button which is the best position\n- With both blinds already in, they have already invested chips\n- The pot is 12 chips, and it costs me 8 to call (pot odds: 12:8 = 1.5:1, or 40% equity needed)\n- With position, I can play postflop well\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (42 BB)\n- The blinds are small relative to my stack\n- Both opponents seem tight based on recent history\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven my position (button) and the fact that both blinds seem tight (folding a lot), this is a good spot to raise and try to steal the blinds. Q7o is not great, but with position and tight opponents, a raise could work.\n\nHowever, a raise commits more chips. Let me think about the alternatives:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight given my position and opponent tendencies\n2. **Call**: Gets me in cheap with position, but Q7o plays poorly multi-way\n3. **Raise**: Best option to take initiative and potentially win the pot preflop\n\nI should raise to 20-24 chips (2.5-3x BB). This is a standard raise size that pressures the blinds.\n\nLet me check if there's any history of these players defending blinds aggressively. From the data, both fold a lot, so they likely won't defend often.",

Wait, let me recalculate:\n  - SB posted 4\n  - BB posted 8\n  - I raised to 20\n  - MiniMax raised to 32 (so he put in 28 more on top of his SB 4)\n  - BB folded (so his 8 is in the pot)\n  - Total pot: 4(SB) + 8(BB) + 20(my raise) + 28(MiniMax's additional) = 60 chips (matches display)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Q7o is a weak hand, especially offsuit\n- I'm facing a 3-bet from the small blind\n- My initial raise was a standard button steal attempt\n- The 3-bet suggests MiniMax has a stronger hand\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall, MiniMax-M2 has raised preflop 9 times in past hands. Looking at the amounts:\n- Mostly small raises (4, 8 chips)\n- One larger raise of 48 chips (hand #21)\n- One raise of 28 chips (hand #27) similar to this situation\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- I need to call 12 chips\n- Pot will be 60 + 12 = 72 chips if I call\n- Pot odds: 12 / 72 = 16.7%\n- I need ~17% equity to call\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\n- My stack: 318 chips\n- MiniMax stack: 170 chips (he's shorter)\n- Effective stack if I call: 170 chips (MiniMax's stack)\n\n**Position:**\n- I have position on MiniMax (he's SB, I'm BTN)\n- This is advantageous postflop\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (39.8 BB)\n- MiniMax is shorter (21.25 BB)\n- Folding preserves my stack\n- Calling could lead to difficult postflop decisions with a weak hand\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Q7o has very poor equity against a 3-betting range\n2. Even with position, this hand plays poorly postflop\n3. The pot odds (17%) might be close if MiniMax is 3-betting light, but Q7o likely has less than 17% equity against a reasonable 3-bet range\n4. My initial raise was a steal attempt that got 3-bet - time to let it go\n5. Better to preserve chips for better spots\n\n**Conclusion:** Fold. The hand is too weak to continue against a 3-bet, even with position and favorable pot odds. The risk of getting stacked with a weak hand outweighs the potential reward.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q7o is too weak to continue against a 3-bet from SB.

My stack is 318 chips (39.8 BB), which is healthy but not huge. The blinds are 4/8.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, seat 1, 200 chips): Has been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 recent actions were folds). Only once checked BB and then bet on flop. Seems tight.\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, 230 chips): Mostly folding, but raised last hand to 32. Could be getting more aggressive.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (SB, seat 5, 206 chips): Has raised preflop 3 times in recent hands (20, 20, 24). Shows some aggression from late position.\n\nI'm first to act UTG. With AKo, I should definitely raise. The standard play is to raise 3-4x BB. Given I'm UTG and there are 3 players behind me who could have position on me, I should raise a bit larger than usual - maybe 4x BB.\n\nMinimum raise is to 16 (double the BB). I should raise to around 24-32 chips (3-4x BB). Given my stack size and position, I'll raise to 28 chips (3.5x BB).\n\nThis is a strong hand that plays well even if called, and I want to build the pot with it. I also want to thin the field since I'm out of position. A raise here will likely get folds from the tight players, and I might take it down preflop or go heads-up.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific observations about how opponents react to UTG raises."

The amount to call is 172 more (since I already put in 8 as BB? Wait, I'm Seat 3, I posted BB? Actually Seat 1 posted BB 8. I'm Seat 3, I raised from BB? No, I'm Seat 3, which is BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". So I'm the BB. Seat 1 is UTG? Actually Seat 1 posted BB 8? Wait, that's confusing: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\" and \"Seat 1 post_bb 8\". But I'm BB. Maybe Seat 1 is SB? Let's think: typical order: SB, BB, then positions. Seat 5 posted SB 4, Seat 1 posted BB 8. That means Seat 5 is SB, Seat 1 is BB. But then I'm Seat 3, which would be UTG? Actually if there are 5 players: Seat 5 (SB), Seat 1 (BB), Seat 2 (UTG), Seat 3 (MP), Seat 4 (CO). But I'm Seat 3, so I'm MP. But description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". So maybe Seat 1 is not BB? Wait, the actions: Seat 5 post_sb 4, Seat 1 post_bb 8. So Seat 1 is BB. But my position says BB. Possibly there's a discrepancy. Let me re-read: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Maybe the table is 6-max? Actually there are 5 players listed: Seat 1, Seat 2, Seat 3 (me), Seat 4, Seat 5. Seat 2 is folded already (0 chips). So maybe Seat 2 was UTG and folded pre? Not shown. Anyway, I have Ac Kh, a strong hand. I raised to 28 (3.5x BB). Then the BB (Seat 1) reraised to 200 total. That's a huge raise, almost all-in (they have only 8 chips? Wait, Seat 1 has 8 chips according to the list: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\". But they raised to 200? That can't be right - they only have 8 chips. Maybe the stack listing is wrong? Let's examine: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\". But they raised to 200 total. That would be more than their stack. Unless the stack is 8 BB? Actually blinds are 4/8, so 8 chips is 1 BB. But they raised to 200 chips (25 BB). That's impossible if they only have 8 chips. Maybe the stack listing is in BB? \"8 chips\" might be 8 BB? But my stack is listed as \"290 chips (36.2 BB)\". So chips are actual chips. So Seat 1 has 8 chips, but raised to 200? That doesn't add up. Let's check the action: \"preflop: Seat 1 raise 200\". That's a raise to 200 total. But they only have 8 chips. Something is off. Perhaps the stack listing is their stack before posting blinds? Seat 1 posted BB 8, so they had 8 chips left after posting? Actually if they had 8 chips and posted BB 8, they'd be all-in. But they raised to 200, which is impossible. Let me think: maybe the stack listing is after they posted? They had 8 chips, posted BB 8, now have 0? But they raised to 200? That can't be. Maybe I misread: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\" could be 8 BB? But my stack is shown as chips and BB. Theirs doesn't show BB. Possibly they have 8 BB, which is 64 chips (since BB is 8). But the listing says \"8 chips\". Hmm.\n\nLet me use tools to recall opponent actions to understand their tendencies. Also search for similar situations. First, let's recall opponent actions for Seat 1."

          "content": "Now, I need to understand the situation better. Looking at opponent actions: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 actions are folds). They showed down hands like 9s8s, 9s9d, As8h, 9h8s. So they play some speculative hands and pocket pairs. Now they raised to 200 after my raise. This is a massive reraise. Given their stack size is listed as 8 chips, but they raised to 200, there must be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the stack listing is in BB? Let's calculate: Blinds are 4/8. My stack is 290 chips (36.2 BB). So 36.2 BB = 290 chips, so BB = 8 chips (290/36.2 \u2248 8). So BB is 8 chips. So 8 chips = 1 BB. So Seat 1 has 8 chips = 1 BB. That makes sense: they have 1 BB. But they raised to 200 chips? That would be 25 BB. That's impossible with 1 BB stack. Unless the raise amount is total including their blind? Let's parse: \"preflop: Seat 1 raise 200\". That could be the total amount they put in, including their BB of 8. So they raised by 192 more (200 total). But they only have 8 chips. So they'd be all-in for their remaining stack. Actually if they have 8 chips total, and they already posted BB 8, they have 0 left. But they raised to 200? That doesn't compute. Maybe the stack listing is before posting? They had 8 chips, posted BB 8, now have 0, but they can't raise. Something is wrong.\n\nLet's think differently: maybe the stack listing is \"8 chips\" meaning 8 big blinds? Not chips. But my stack is listed as \"290 chips (36.2 BB)\". So chips are separate from BB. So Seat 1 has 8 chips, not 8 BB. That's 1 BB. But they raised to 200 chips (25 BB). That's impossible. Unless the raise is 200 chips total, and they have more than 8 chips. Possibly the stack listing is outdated or there's a mistake. Let's look at the pot size: Pot is 232 chips. How did that happen? Let's calculate: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, I raised to 28, then Seat 1 raised to 200. So pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + my 28 + Seat 1's 200 = 240? Wait, Seat 1's raise includes their BB? They already posted BB 8, so they put additional 192 to make total 200. So pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + my 28 + Seat 1 additional 192 = 232. Yes, that's correct. So Seat 1 put in 192 more on top of their BB. So they have at least 192 chips more than their BB. So their stack must be larger than 8 chips. The listing must be wrong. Maybe \"8 chips\" is their remaining after posting? No, they posted BB 8, so if they had 8 chips, they'd be all-in. But they raised 192 more, so they must have had at least 200 chips total before posting? Actually, they posted BB 8, then raised to 200 total, so they put in 192 more. So they need at least 192 chips after posting BB. So their stack before posting was at least 200 chips. The listing \"8 chips\" is likely a display error or maybe it's 8 BB (64 chips). But 8 BB = 64 chips, still not enough for 200 total. So maybe it's 200 chips total, and they have enough. I need to make a decision based on the situation.\n\nI have Ac Kh, a premium hand. Facing a reraise to 200 total. I have 290 chips total. I already put in 28? Wait, I raised to 28 from BB. So I have 290 chips total, I put in 28, so I have 262 left. Amount to call is 172 more (since I already put 28, and total to call is 200? Actually amount to call: 172. That means I need to put 172 more to match the 200 total. So if I call, I'll have 262 - 172 = 90 chips left. Pot after my call would be 232 + 172 = 404 chips. I'm getting pot odds of 172 to win 404, which is about 1:2.35, or 30% equity needed. Against a range of premium pairs ("

That doesn't add up. Let's check the action: \"preflop: Seat 1 raise 200\". That's a raise to 200 total. But they only have 8 chips. Something is off. Perhaps the stack listing is their stack before posting blinds? Seat 1 posted BB 8, so they had 8 chips left after posting? Actually if they had 8 chips and posted BB 8, they'd be all-in. But they raised to 200, which is impossible. Let me think: maybe the stack listing is after they posted? They had 8 chips, posted BB 8, now have 0? But they raised to 200? That can't be. Maybe I misread: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\" could be 8 BB? But my stack is shown as chips and BB. Theirs doesn't show BB. Possibly they have 8 BB, which is 64 chips (since BB is 8). But the listing says \"8 chips\". Hmm.\n\nLet me use tools to recall opponent actions to understand their tendencies. Also search for similar situations. First, let's recall opponent actions for Seat 1.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now, I need to understand the situation better. Looking at opponent actions: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 actions are folds). They showed down hands like 9s8s, 9s9d, As8h, 9h8s. So they play some speculative hands and pocket pairs. Now they raised to 200 after my raise. This is a massive reraise. Given their stack size is listed as 8 chips, but they raised to 200, there must be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the stack listing is in BB? Let's calculate: Blinds are 4/8. My stack is 290 chips (36.2 BB). So 36.2 BB = 290 chips, so BB = 8 chips (290/36.2 \u2248 8). So BB is 8 chips. So 8 chips = 1 BB. So Seat 1 has 8 chips = 1 BB. That makes sense: they have 1 BB. But they raised to 200 chips? That would be 25 BB. That's impossible with 1 BB stack. Unless the raise amount is total including their blind? Let's parse: \"preflop: Seat 1 raise 200\". That could be the total amount they put in, including their BB of 8. So they raised by 192 more (200 total). But they only have 8 chips. So they'd be all-in for their remaining stack. Actually if they have 8 chips total, and they already posted BB 8, they have 0 left. But they raised to 200? That doesn't compute. Maybe the stack listing is before posting? They had 8 chips, posted BB 8, now have 0, but they can't raise. Something is wrong.\n\nLet's think differently: maybe the stack listing is \"8 chips\" meaning 8 big blinds? Not chips. But my stack is listed as \"290 chips (36.2 BB)\". So chips are separate from BB. So Seat 1 has 8 chips, not 8 BB. That's 1 BB. But they raised to 200 chips (25 BB). That's impossible. Unless the raise is 200 chips total, and they have more than 8 chips. Possibly the stack listing is outdated or there's a mistake. Let's look at the pot size: Pot is 232 chips. How did that happen? Let's calculate: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, I raised to 28, then Seat 1 raised to 200. So pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + my 28 + Seat 1's 200 = 240? Wait, Seat 1's raise includes their BB? They already posted BB 8, so they put additional 192 to make total 200. So pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + my 28 + Seat 1 additional 192 = 232. Yes, that's correct. So Seat 1 put in 192 more on top of their BB. So they have at least 192 chips more than their BB. So their stack must be larger than 8 chips. The listing must be wrong. Maybe \"8 chips\" is their remaining after posting? No, they posted BB 8, so if they had 8 chips, they'd be all-in. But they raised 192 more, so they must have had at least 200 chips total before posting? Actually, they posted BB 8, then raised to 200 total, so they put in 192 more. So they need at least 192 chips after posting BB. So their stack before posting was at least 200 chips. The listing \"8 chips\" is likely a display error or maybe it's 8 BB (64 chips). But 8 BB = 64 chips, still not enough for 200 total. So maybe it's 200 chips total, and they have enough. I need to make a decision based on the situation.\n\nI have Ac Kh, a premium hand. Facing a reraise to 200 total. I have 290 chips total. I already put in 28? Wait, I raised to 28 from BB. So I have 290 chips total, I put in 28, so I have 262 left. Amount to call is 172 more (since I already put 28, and total to call is 200? Actually amount to call: 172. That means I need to put 172 more to match the 200 total. So if I call, I'll have 262 - 172 = 90 chips left. Pot after my call would be 232 + 172 = 404 chips. I'm getting pot odds of 172 to win 404, which is about 1:2.35, or 30% equity needed. Against a range of premium pairs (",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to provide a JSON response. Let me think about the decision.\n\nI have Ac Kh, facing a reraise to 200 total. My stack is 290 chips. I already put in 28. Amount to call is 172 more. If I call, I'll have 90 chips left. Pot will be 404 chips. I'm getting pot odds of 172 to win 404, which is about 30% equity needed.\n\nAgainst a typical 3-bet range from the BB (Seat 1), what could they have? They might have premium pairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, maybe AK). Possibly they're squeezing with a wider range given the dynamics? But they only have 8 chips listed, but that must be wrong. Actually, let me check the opponent's actions more. I should use the recall tool to see their previous raises. But I need to output JSON now.\n\nGiven the situation: I have AK suited? Actually Ac Kh is offsuit. Still a strong hand. Facing a massive reraise. This could be a shove given stack sizes? The minimum raise to is 372, which is more than my stack (I have 290 total). So I can only call or fold. I cannot raise because \"raise\" is not in legal actions (only fold, call). So I must either fold or call.\n\nIf I call, I'm committing 172 more with 90 behind. The pot will be 404, and effective stack for the flop will be 90 (since I have 90 left). That's about 11 BB (blinds 4/8, so 90 chips = 11.25 BB). So I'll be pot committed on most flops.\n\nGiven the strength of AK and the pot odds, calling seems reasonable. However, this opponent raised to 200 total, which is a huge overbet relative to pot. That suggests extreme strength. They might have AA or KK. But AK is a hand that does well against many premium pairs except AA and KK. Against AA, I have about 12% equity. Against KK, about 30% equity. Against QQ, about 46% equity. Against AK, 50% equity. Against JJ, 48% equity. So my average equity against a tight range (QQ+, AK) is around 40%. That's better than the 30% needed. So mathematically, call is profitable.\n\nBut tournament considerations: I have 36 BB stack. If I call and lose, I'll be down to 90 chips (11 BB). If I win, I'll have 290 + 232 = 522 chips? Wait, if I call and win, I'll have my remaining 90 plus the pot of 404 = 494 chips? Actually, I'd have 90 left after calling, plus win pot of 404, total 494 chips (61.75 BB). That's a big increase. If I fold, I'll have 262 chips (32.75 BB). So risk vs reward: risk 172 to win 232 (the pot before my call). Actually pot before my call is 232. I need to call 172 to win 232, so pot odds are 1:1.35, which is worse. Wait, I need to calculate correctly.\n\nPot before my decision: 232 chips. I need to call 172. So pot odds are 172 to win 232, which is 1:1.35, meaning I need 42.5% equity (172/(172+232)=0.425). That's higher. Against QQ+, AK, my equity is about 40%. Slightly below. But if I include some bluffs or wider hands, equity improves. However, given the huge raise size, this looks like a very strong hand. Could be AA or KK. That would reduce my equity.\n\nBut also, the opponent's stack is unclear. They might be short-stacked and shoving? Actually, they raised to 200, not all-in. Minimum raise to is 372, so they have more behind. They might have a bigger stack than listed.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the fact that I'm out of position (I'm BB, they are... actually they are BB? Wait, I'm BB according to position. But Seat 1 posted BB. So maybe I'm not BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Maybe there's a discrepancy. Regardless, I'm out of position relative to the raiser.\n\nI think I should call. AK is too strong to fold for 42.5% pot odds. Even against a tight range, it's close. But tournament life: losing would leave me with 11 BB, still playable. Winning would give me 61 BB, a great stack.\n\nI'll call. Let's output JSON.",

Opponent only has 8 chips total - they're essentially all-in preflop\n2. The pot is 404 chips, which is huge relative to stacks\n3. The flop is 6h 3c 9h - this is a relatively dry board that likely didn't hit my opponent's range hard\n4. My hand is AK offsuit - I have two overcards (Ace and King) to the board\n5. Opponent checked on the flop (they're essentially all-in, so checking is automatic)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding a lot preflop (7 of 10 recorded actions were folds). They only showed aggression in hand #56 where they bet 16 on the flop. This suggests they might be tight/passive.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Opponent has only 8 chips left, so they're essentially all-in\n- The pot is already 404 chips, and I have 118 chips total\n- I called their all-in preflop with AK, which is standard\n- On this flop, my AK has about 50% equity against most reasonable ranges\n- Since opponent is all-in, I should check and see the turn and river\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check. The opponent is all-in (only 8 chips), so there's no more betting. Checking allows the hand to continue to showdown. My AK has good equity against most hands, and checking is the only logical play since the opponent has no chips left to bet.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Opponent is essentially all-in with only 8 chips remaining. Pot is 404 chips, I have AK on a 6h 3c 9h board with two overcards. Checking allows hand to proceed to showdown where my AK has good equity against most ranges.

          "content": "I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the BB with Ac Kh. My stack is 118 chips (14.8 BB). The board is 6h 3c 9h Qs. Pot is 404 chips. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has only 8 chips left. They raised to 200 preflop, which was essentially all-in (they had 8 chips to start, posted BB of 8, then raised 200, so they must have gone all-in). I called 172 more preflop (my initial raise was 28, so total I put in 28+172=200). So we both have 200 in the pot? Wait, let's track: Seat 1 started with 8 chips, posted BB 8, then raised 200 total? Actually, they posted BB 8, then raised to 200 total. That's a raise of 192 more? Let's compute: They had 8 chips total. They posted BB 8, leaving 0. Then they raised to 200 total, which would require 192 more, but they only had 0 left. So they actually went all-in for their remaining stack of 8? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's re-examine: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips. They posted BB 8, so they have 0 left. Then they \"raise 200\". That must be a misprint? Actually, maybe they had 8 chips after posting BB? No, they posted BB 8, so they'd have 0. But the action says \"Seat 1 raise 200\". That seems impossible. Perhaps they had 208 chips originally? But the table shows 8 chips now. Maybe they started with more and lost some? Let's look at stack sizes: Seat 1: 8 chips, Seat 2: 0 chips folded, Seat 3 (me): 118, Seat 4: 230 folded, Seat 5: 206 folded.\n\nSo Seat 1 has only 8 chips. The preflop action: Seat 5 posts SB 4, Seat 1 posts BB 8, Seat 3 (me) raises to 28, Seat 4 folds, Seat 5 folds, Seat 1 raises to 200, Seat 3 calls 172. That means Seat 1 raised to 200 total, which is 192 more than the BB of 8. But they only have 8 chips total, so they can't raise to 200. Unless they had more chips earlier? Actually, maybe they had 200 chips before posting BB? But the current stack is 8. That suggests they lost chips in this hand? Wait, maybe the stack sizes shown are current, after the action? Let's think: If Seat 1 raised to 200, they'd need 192 more on top of their BB 8. That would be 200 total. They'd need at least 192 chips. But they show 8 chips now. That means they must have put all their chips in and are now all-in with 8? Actually, maybe they had 200 chips, posted BB 8 (192 left), then raised to 200 total (putting in 192 more), leaving 0. So they'd be all-in. That would make sense: they started with 200, posted BB 8, raised all-in for remaining 192, total 200. But the display shows 8 chips now. That might be a bug or misrepresentation. Possibly the stack shown is what they have left after the action? If they went all-in for 192, they'd have 0 left. But it shows 8. Hmm.\n\nAnyway, the key point: Seat 1 has only 8 chips left. They checked on the flop and turn. The pot is 404 chips. I have Ac Kh, board 6h 3c 9h Qs. I have ace-high with backdoor flush draw (hearts) and gutshot straight draw? Actually, A-K on board 6-3-9-Q gives me ace-high, no pair. I have two overcards (A and K), but the queen is on board, so only ace is an overcard. I have backdoor nut flush draw (hearts). I also have a gutshot straight draw: need a ten for a straight (10-J? Actually, board 6-3-9-Q, I have A-K, so I need a ten to make a straight? That would be K-Q-10-9-8? No. Let's compute: Board 6-3-9-Q. My hand A-K. Possible straights: if a ten comes, I'd have A-K-Q-10-9? That's not a straight. If a jack comes, I'd have A-K-Q"

          "content": "I need to understand the situation better. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot preflop. In hand 56, they had 9h8s and bet on flop with Ace-high board, then checked turn and river. They seem to be a tight player. But in this hand, they raised to 200 preflop with only 8 chips stack? That seems like a desperate all-in move. They likely have a strong hand like a big pair or AK/AQ. Given they have only 8 chips left, they're essentially all-in. The pot is 404 chips. I have Ac Kh, board 6h 3c 9h Qs. I have ace-high with backdoor flush draw. The opponent checked both flop and turn. Since they're all-in (or nearly all-in), they can't bet anymore. They're just waiting for the river. I have to decide whether to check or bet. Actually, my legal actions are fold or check. I cannot bet because the amount to call is 0 and I can only check. Wait, the prompt says \"Legal actions: fold, check\". That means I can only check or fold. But why would I fold when there's nothing to call? That doesn't make sense. Unless there's a side pot? Let's think: If Seat 1 is all-in for less than my bet, there might be a main pot and side pot. But they have 8 chips now. They raised to 200 preflop, I called 172. The total pot should be: My 200 + their 200? Actually, they raised to 200, but they only had 8 chips total? Let's recalc: They started with 8 chips. They posted BB 8, so they have 0 left. Then they \"raise 200\". That must mean they went all-in for their remaining 0? That's impossible. Maybe the stack display is wrong. Perhaps they had 208 chips originally? But the table shows 8 now. Could be they lost chips in this hand? Actually, maybe the stack sizes shown are at the start of the hand? Let's look: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\". That's likely their stack at the start of the hand. They posted BB 8, leaving 0. Then they \"raise 200\" - that's likely a misprint; maybe they raised all-in for their remaining stack? But they have 0 left after posting BB. So they can't raise. Unless they had more than 8. Hmm.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume Seat 1 is all-in or nearly all-in. The pot is 404 chips. I have 118 chips total. I've already put in 200? Wait, I raised to 28 preflop, then called 172 more, so I've put in 200 total. That's more than my stack of 118. That's impossible. Something is off. Let's compute: My stack is 118 chips. I raised to 28 preflop (that's 20 more than BB 8). Then Seat 1 raised to 200, and I called 172 more. That would be 28 + 172 = 200 total. But I only have 118 chips, so I can't call 172 more. Unless my stack was larger at start? The display says \"Your Stack: 118 chips (14.8 BB)\". That's current stack after the action? Possibly after calling 172, I'd have 118 left? Let's calculate: If I started with 118 + 200 = 318? No.\n\nI think the stack sizes shown are current after the action. So I have 118 chips left after putting in 200. That means I started with 318 chips. That makes sense: I had 318, put in 200, leaving 118. Seat 1 started with 208 chips, posted BB 8 (200 left), raised to 200 total (put in 192 more), leaving 8. So they have 8 chips left. Yes, that fits: Seat 1 has 8 chips left after putting in 200. So they are essentially all-in; their remaining 8 chips are not in the main pot? Actually, the main pot includes their 200. The side pot would be between me and any other players, but others folded. So there's only main pot of 404 chips (my 200 + their 200 + blinds 4 from SB). Actually, SB folded preflop after posting 4, so that 4 is in pot. So total pot = 200 (me) + 200 (Seat 1) + 4 (SB) = 404. Yes.\n\nNow, Seat 1 is all-in for 200, and has 8 chips left. They cannot bet further"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the BB with Ac Kh. My stack is 118 chips (14.8 BB). The board is 6h 3c 9h Qs. Pot is 404 chips. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has only 8 chips left. They raised to 200 preflop, which was essentially all-in (they had 8 chips to start, posted BB of 8, then raised 200, so they must have gone all-in). I called 172 more preflop (my initial raise was 28, so total I put in 28+172=200). So we both have 200 in the pot? Wait, let's track: Seat 1 started with 8 chips, posted BB 8, then raised 200 total? Actually, they posted BB 8, then raised to 200 total. That's a raise of 192 more? Let's compute: They had 8 chips total. They posted BB 8, leaving 0. Then they raised to 200 total, which would require 192 more, but they only had 0 left. So they actually went all-in for their remaining stack of 8? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's re-examine: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips. They posted BB 8, so they have 0 left. Then they \"raise 200\". That must be a misprint? Actually, maybe they had 8 chips after posting BB? No, they posted BB 8, so they'd have 0. But the action says \"Seat 1 raise 200\". That seems impossible. Perhaps they had 208 chips originally? But the table shows 8 chips now. Maybe they started with more and lost some? Let's look at stack sizes: Seat 1: 8 chips, Seat 2: 0 chips folded, Seat 3 (me): 118, Seat 4: 230 folded, Seat 5: 206 folded.\n\nSo Seat 1 has only 8 chips. The preflop action: Seat 5 posts SB 4, Seat 1 posts BB 8, Seat 3 (me) raises to 28, Seat 4 folds, Seat 5 folds, Seat 1 raises to 200, Seat 3 calls 172. That means Seat 1 raised to 200 total, which is 192 more than the BB of 8. But they only have 8 chips total, so they can't raise to 200. Unless they had more chips earlier? Actually, maybe they had 200 chips before posting BB? But the current stack is 8. That suggests they lost chips in this hand? Wait, maybe the stack sizes shown are current, after the action? Let's think: If Seat 1 raised to 200, they'd need 192 more on top of their BB 8. That would be 200 total. They'd need at least 192 chips. But they show 8 chips now. That means they must have put all their chips in and are now all-in with 8? Actually, maybe they had 200 chips, posted BB 8 (192 left), then raised to 200 total (putting in 192 more), leaving 0. So they'd be all-in. That would make sense: they started with 200, posted BB 8, raised all-in for remaining 192, total 200. But the display shows 8 chips now. That might be a bug or misrepresentation. Possibly the stack shown is what they have left after the action? If they went all-in for 192, they'd have 0 left. But it shows 8. Hmm.\n\nAnyway, the key point: Seat 1 has only 8 chips left. They checked on the flop and turn. The pot is 404 chips. I have Ac Kh, board 6h 3c 9h Qs. I have ace-high with backdoor flush draw (hearts) and gutshot straight draw? Actually, A-K on board 6-3-9-Q gives me ace-high, no pair. I have two overcards (A and K), but the queen is on board, so only ace is an overcard. I have backdoor nut flush draw (hearts). I also have a gutshot straight draw: need a ten for a straight (10-J? Actually, board 6-3-9-Q, I have A-K, so I need a ten to make a straight? That would be K-Q-10-9-8? No. Let's compute: Board 6-3-9-Q. My hand A-K. Possible straights: if a ten comes, I'd have A-K-Q-10-9? That's not a straight. If a jack comes, I'd have A-K-Q",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to understand the situation better. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot preflop. In hand 56, they had 9h8s and bet on flop with Ace-high board, then checked turn and river. They seem to be a tight player. But in this hand, they raised to 200 preflop with only 8 chips stack? That seems like a desperate all-in move. They likely have a strong hand like a big pair or AK/AQ. Given they have only 8 chips left, they're essentially all-in. The pot is 404 chips. I have Ac Kh, board 6h 3c 9h Qs. I have ace-high with backdoor flush draw. The opponent checked both flop and turn. Since they're all-in (or nearly all-in), they can't bet anymore. They're just waiting for the river. I have to decide whether to check or bet. Actually, my legal actions are fold or check. I cannot bet because the amount to call is 0 and I can only check. Wait, the prompt says \"Legal actions: fold, check\". That means I can only check or fold. But why would I fold when there's nothing to call? That doesn't make sense. Unless there's a side pot? Let's think: If Seat 1 is all-in for less than my bet, there might be a main pot and side pot. But they have 8 chips now. They raised to 200 preflop, I called 172. The total pot should be: My 200 + their 200? Actually, they raised to 200, but they only had 8 chips total? Let's recalc: They started with 8 chips. They posted BB 8, so they have 0 left. Then they \"raise 200\". That must mean they went all-in for their remaining 0? That's impossible. Maybe the stack display is wrong. Perhaps they had 208 chips originally? But the table shows 8 now. Could be they lost chips in this hand? Actually, maybe the stack sizes shown are at the start of the hand? Let's look: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\". That's likely their stack at the start of the hand. They posted BB 8, leaving 0. Then they \"raise 200\" - that's likely a misprint; maybe they raised all-in for their remaining stack? But they have 0 left after posting BB. So they can't raise. Unless they had more than 8. Hmm.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume Seat 1 is all-in or nearly all-in. The pot is 404 chips. I have 118 chips total. I've already put in 200? Wait, I raised to 28 preflop, then called 172 more, so I've put in 200 total. That's more than my stack of 118. That's impossible. Something is off. Let's compute: My stack is 118 chips. I raised to 28 preflop (that's 20 more than BB 8). Then Seat 1 raised to 200, and I called 172 more. That would be 28 + 172 = 200 total. But I only have 118 chips, so I can't call 172 more. Unless my stack was larger at start? The display says \"Your Stack: 118 chips (14.8 BB)\". That's current stack after the action? Possibly after calling 172, I'd have 118 left? Let's calculate: If I started with 118 + 200 = 318? No.\n\nI think the stack sizes shown are current after the action. So I have 118 chips left after putting in 200. That means I started with 318 chips. That makes sense: I had 318, put in 200, leaving 118. Seat 1 started with 208 chips, posted BB 8 (200 left), raised to 200 total (put in 192 more), leaving 8. So they have 8 chips left. Yes, that fits: Seat 1 has 8 chips left after putting in 200. So they are essentially all-in; their remaining 8 chips are not in the main pot? Actually, the main pot includes their 200. The side pot would be between me and any other players, but others folded. So there's only main pot of 404 chips (my 200 + their 200 + blinds 4 from SB). Actually, SB folded preflop after posting 4, so that 4 is in pot. So total pot = 200 (me) + 200 (Seat 1) + 4 (SB) = 404. Yes.\n\nNow, Seat 1 is all-in for 200, and has 8 chips left. They cannot bet further",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have more context. The opponent (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 8 hands they folded preflop). In hand 56, they had 9h8s and bet on flop with Ace-high board, then checked turn and river. They seem to be a tight player who folds most hands preflop. Their preflop raise to 200 (all-in) with only 8 chips stack indicates desperation or a strong hand. Given their tight tendencies, they likely have a premium hand: AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe JJ. The board has Qs, which hits QQ. I have Ac Kh, so I'm behind most of their range. I have ace-high with backdoor flush draw. The pot is 404 chips. I have 118 chips left. The opponent is all-in (or has 8 chips left). They checked flop and turn because they're all-in and cannot bet further. I have to decide whether to check or fold. Folding seems ridiculous when there's no bet to call. But wait, why is fold a legal action? Possibly because there's a side pot? Actually, the opponent has 8 chips left. They could potentially bet those 8 chips on the river? But they checked turn. On the river, they might bet their last 8 chips. But currently, amount to call is 0. I should check and see the river. There's no reason to fold when I don't have to put more chips in. I can check and see the river card for free. If the opponent bets 8 chips on river, I'll have to decide whether to call 8 chips into a 404 pot (huge pot odds). That's an easy call with any chance. So I should check now. Let me think about my hand: Ac Kh on board 6h 3c 9h Qs. I have ace-high, backdoor nut flush draw (hearts). I need a heart on river for flush (would be nut flush). I also have gutshot straight draw? Actually, need a ten for a straight? Board: 6-3-9-Q. My hand A-K. If a ten comes, I'd have A-K-Q-10-9? That's not a straight. If a jack comes, I'd have A-K-Q-J-9? Not a straight. So no straight draw. Only flush draw. So I have 9 outs for flush (13 hearts - 2 on board - 2 in my hand? I have Ac Kh, so I have Kh (heart). Board has 6h and 9h? Wait board: 6h 3c 9h Qs. So there are two hearts on board: 6h and 9h. I have Kh. So there are 13 hearts total, minus 3 known hearts = 10 remaining. But I need a heart on river for flush. So 10 outs. However, some of those hearts might give opponent a flush if they have hearts? Unlikely. So about 20% chance to hit flush on river. Pot is 404, and I might have to call 8 chips on river if opponent bets. That's trivial pot odds. So I should check.\n\nBut wait, could I bet? Legal actions are only fold or check. So I cannot bet. So I must check. There's no decision to make really. However, maybe there's a side pot? Actually, the opponent has 8 chips left. If I bet, I could bet into a side pot? But I can't bet because legal actions don't include bet or raise. So I'll check.\n\nThus my action is check. Let me output JSON.",

Preflop: I raised to 28 from BB (standard with AK)\n2. Opponent 3-bet to 200 from BB (seat 1) - very large sizing\n3. I called 172 more (putting in 200 total)\n4. Flop: 6h 3c 9h - opponent checked, I checked back\n5. Turn: Qs - opponent checked, I checked back  \n6. River: 2s - opponent checked\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. Opponent only has 8 chips left (1 BB) - they're essentially all-in already\n2. The pot is massive at 404 chips\n3. My hand: Ace-high with AK (no pair)\n4. Board is low cards with Q high, no obvious draws completed (flush draws missed)\n5. Opponent showed extreme aggression preflop with a huge 3-bet to 200 (25 BB)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies from Memory:**\n- I see they've made several preflop raises, including some large ones (28, 24, 12)\n- They've checked rivers multiple times and sometimes folded to bets\n- No showdown data available\n\n**Hand Strength Analysis:**\n- I have Ace-high only on this board\n- Possible opponent holdings: \n  - Strong pairs (QQ+, maybe 99, 66, 33) - would likely bet river for value\n  - Missed draws (hearts, straight draws) - checking makes sense\n  - Bluffs (A5s, other Ax hands) - checking makes sense\n  - Medium pairs (JJ, TT, maybe 88) - might check\n\n**Decision Points:**\n- Since opponent only has 8 chips left, any bet would effectively put them all-in\n- They checked to me, giving me the option to check or bet\n- With Ace-high, I'm likely behind most value hands\n- However, the opponent's river check after aggressive preflop suggests weakness\n\n**Pot Odds Consideration:**\n- Pot is 404 chips\n- To bet, I'd need to risk my remaining 118 chips (but opponent only has 8 to call)\n- If I bet 8 (or any amount up to 118), opponent would need to call their last 8\n- If they fold, I win 404 chips\n- If they call with better, I lose my bet (max 8 chips since they only have 8)\n\nActually wait - I need to think about this more carefully. The opponent has only 8 chips left. If I bet ANY amount, they can only call up to 8 chips. So I could bet 8 chips (or less) and they'd have to decide whether to call with their last 8.\n\nBut actually, looking at the legal actions: I only have \"fold\" or \"check\" available. That means I cannot bet/raise here. The minimum raise to would be 172, but I only have 118 chips total. However, I should be able to bet since opponent checked to me... unless there's something about the opponent having only 8 chips?\n\nLet me re-read: \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check\". So I cannot bet here. That must be because the opponent only has 8 chips and is effectively all-in? Or maybe because I'm last to act and they checked?\n\nActually, in poker when someone is all-in for less than a full bet, and they check, the other player can only check or fold - they cannot bet because the all-in player has no chips to call a bet. That makes sense here.\n\nSo my options are:\n1. Check - go to showdown\n2. Fold - surrender the pot\n\nWith 404 chips in the pot and only Ace-high, but opponent showing weakness by checking all streets after aggressive preflop, I should check and see what they have. Folding would be terrible since I've already invested 200 chips and the pot is huge.\n\n**Final Decision:** Check and see showdown. I have Ace-high which might be good if opponent was bluffing or has a weaker hand. Given opponent's extreme preflop aggression and subsequent checking on all streets, they likely have a missed draw or medium pair that's afraid of the Q on board.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\":"

Looking at opponent tendencies: GPT-OSS-120B (in BB) has been raising preflop frequently (5 raises in recent hands). They've been raising to amounts like 20, 24 chips, which are small raises.\n\nMy stack is short (7.4 BB). With A9o from the button, I should be looking to play aggressively. The pot is 24 chips, and I need to call 16 to see a flop. If I raise, minimum raise is to 32 total (16 more).\n\nGiven my short stack, I should consider going all-in or making a substantial raise. A9o is strong enough to play for my stack against likely blinds. The BB has been aggressive, so they might call with a wide range.\n\nIf I just call 16, I'll have 102 left and pot will be 40. That's not ideal with a short stack. Better to raise and put pressure on.\n\nI could go all-in (118 total). That would be a 102 raise over the BB. That's a strong move that might take it down preflop, and if called, A9o has decent equity against most hands.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I'm very short (7.4 BB). Need to accumulate chips soon. A9o from button is a good spot to double up or steal blinds.\n\nI'll go all-in.",

The blinds are 8/16, so I'm in the small blind structure.\n\nLooking at my position and hand: UTG with 7-5 offsuit is an automatic fold in almost all situations. This hand has very little potential to make strong hands, and even when it does hit a pair, it's a weak pair vulnerable to overcards.\n\nStack size considerations: With 8.9 BB, I'm getting into push/fold territory, but not with this hand from UTG. I should be looking for better spots to get my chips in, preferably when I have fold equity or a stronger hand.\n\nOpponent tendencies: Looking at the data, MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot recently (folded last 4 hands). GPT-OSS-120B has also been folding frequently. However, I'm first to act, so I don't know what they'll do after me.\n\nPot odds: I'd need to call 16 chips into a pot of 24, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds (40% equity needed). My hand doesn't have anywhere near that equity against random hands.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm short-stacked and need to preserve my stack for better opportunities. Calling or raising with this hand would be spewing chips.\n\nThe only reasonable play is to fold. Even if I were on the button or in late position with this stack size, 7-5 offsuit is still a fold. From UTG, it's an especially easy fold.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors I should consider... No, this is clear cut."

My stack is only 142 chips (8.9 BB), which is very short. The blinds are 8/16, so I'm in the small blind structure.\n\nLooking at my position and hand: UTG with 7-5 offsuit is an automatic fold in almost all situations. This hand has very little potential to make strong hands, and even when it does hit a pair, it's a weak pair vulnerable to overcards.\n\nStack size considerations: With 8.9 BB, I'm getting into push/fold territory, but not with this hand from UTG. I should be looking for better spots to get my chips in, preferably when I have fold equity or a stronger hand.\n\nOpponent tendencies: Looking at the data, MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot recently (folded last 4 hands). GPT-OSS-120B has also been folding frequently. However, I'm first to act, so I don't know what they'll do after me.\n\nPot odds: I'd need to call 16 chips into a pot of 24, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds (40% equity needed). My hand doesn't have anywhere near that equity against random hands.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm short-stacked and need to preserve my stack for better opportunities. Calling or raising with this hand would be spewing chips.\n\nThe only reasonable play is to fold. Even if I were on the button or in late position with this stack size, 7-5 offsuit is still a fold. From UTG, it's an especially easy fold.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors I should consider... No, this is clear cut.",

          "content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with K2 offsuit. My stack is 126 chips (7.9 BB). The pot is 198 chips. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 174 total, but wait, Seat 5 has 0 chips and is marked \"out\"? That seems contradictory. Let me re-read: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). But it says \"Seat 5 raise 174\". That can't be right if they have 0 chips. Maybe it's a misprint or they went all-in with their last chips? The pot is 198, which includes blinds (8+16=24) plus the raise. If Seat 5 raised to 174 total, that would be 174-16=158 more than my BB. Amount to call is 158, which matches. My stack is 126, so I can't even call the full amount - I only have 126 total, and I've already put in 16 as BB. So I have 110 chips left. To call 158, I'd need to put in 110 more (all-in). Actually, let me calculate: I have 126 total. I've already put 16 in as BB. So I have 110 left. The amount to call is 158, which is more than my remaining stack. So I can go all-in for my remaining 110. That would be a call of my entire stack.\n\nBut wait, the legal actions are only fold or call. No raise option. So I can either fold or call all-in. Let's think about the hand: K2 offsuit is a terrible hand, especially against a raise. The raiser is Seat 5 who has 0 chips and is marked \"out\" - maybe they're actually all-in? That would make sense: they went all-in with their last chips. If they have 0 chips, they must be all-in. But the raise amount is 174, which seems high. Maybe they had some chips and went all-in.\n\nI need to consider tournament situation: I have 126 chips (7.9 BB). That's very short-stacked. The blinds are 8/16, so I'm in danger of blinding out soon. I'm in the BB, so I've already put in 16. If I fold, I'll have 110 chips left (6.9 BB). If I call all-in and win, I'd double up to about 252 chips (15.8 BB). If I lose, I'm out.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 198. To call, I need to put in 110 more (my remaining stack). So pot is offering 198:110, or about 1.8:1. I need about 35% equity to break even. Does K2o have 35% equity against a typical all-in range?\n\nLet me think about opponent's range. Seat 5 is short-stacked (0 chips? actually they raised, so they must have had chips). They raised from UTG? Actually seat positions: Seat 1 is SB, Seat 2 folded, Seat 3 is me (BB), Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 raised. So Seat 5 is UTG? Actually with 5 players, positions: SB (Seat 1), BB (me, Seat 3), UTG (Seat 4), MP (Seat 5), CO (none). So Seat 5 raised from MP position. They might be stealing or have a decent hand.\n\nBut K2o is really bad. Against a reasonable all-in range like 22+, A2s+, K2s+, Q2s+, J2s+, T2s+, 92s+, 82s+, 72s+, 62s+, 52s+, 42s+, 32s, A2o+, K2o+, Q2o+, J2o+, T2o+, 92o+, 82o+, 72o+, 62o+, 52o+, 42o+, 32o (any pair, any ace, any king, any two broadway, any suited), K2o has about 35% equity. Actually let me estimate: K2o vs top 50% range has about 40% equity. But if opponent is really tight (top 20%), K2o has maybe 30% equity. With my short stack, I might need to gamble.\n\nI should also consider that if I fold, I'll have 110 chips (6.9 BB) and be in SB next hand (posting 8). So I'll have 102 after posting SB, then need to play from SB. That's still very short.\n\nI need to recall opponent tendencies. Let me use the tools to see Seat 5's actions."

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with K2 offsuit. My stack is 126 chips (7.9 BB). The pot is 198 chips. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 174 total, but wait, Seat 5 has 0 chips and is marked \"out\"? That seems contradictory. Let me re-read: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). But it says \"Seat 5 raise 174\". That can't be right if they have 0 chips. Maybe it's a misprint or they went all-in with their last chips? The pot is 198, which includes blinds (8+16=24) plus the raise. If Seat 5 raised to 174 total, that would be 174-16=158 more than my BB. Amount to call is 158, which matches. My stack is 126, so I can't even call the full amount - I only have 126 total, and I've already put in 16 as BB. So I have 110 chips left. To call 158, I'd need to put in 110 more (all-in). Actually, let me calculate: I have 126 total. I've already put 16 in as BB. So I have 110 left. The amount to call is 158, which is more than my remaining stack. So I can go all-in for my remaining 110. That would be a call of my entire stack.\n\nBut wait, the legal actions are only fold or call. No raise option. So I can either fold or call all-in. Let's think about the hand: K2 offsuit is a terrible hand, especially against a raise. The raiser is Seat 5 who has 0 chips and is marked \"out\" - maybe they're actually all-in? That would make sense: they went all-in with their last chips. If they have 0 chips, they must be all-in. But the raise amount is 174, which seems high. Maybe they had some chips and went all-in.\n\nI need to consider tournament situation: I have 126 chips (7.9 BB). That's very short-stacked. The blinds are 8/16, so I'm in danger of blinding out soon. I'm in the BB, so I've already put in 16. If I fold, I'll have 110 chips left (6.9 BB). If I call all-in and win, I'd double up to about 252 chips (15.8 BB). If I lose, I'm out.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 198. To call, I need to put in 110 more (my remaining stack). So pot is offering 198:110, or about 1.8:1. I need about 35% equity to break even. Does K2o have 35% equity against a typical all-in range?\n\nLet me think about opponent's range. Seat 5 is short-stacked (0 chips? actually they raised, so they must have had chips). They raised from UTG? Actually seat positions: Seat 1 is SB, Seat 2 folded, Seat 3 is me (BB), Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 raised. So Seat 5 is UTG? Actually with 5 players, positions: SB (Seat 1), BB (me, Seat 3), UTG (Seat 4), MP (Seat 5), CO (none). So Seat 5 raised from MP position. They might be stealing or have a decent hand.\n\nBut K2o is really bad. Against a reasonable all-in range like 22+, A2s+, K2s+, Q2s+, J2s+, T2s+, 92s+, 82s+, 72s+, 62s+, 52s+, 42s+, 32s, A2o+, K2o+, Q2o+, J2o+, T2o+, 92o+, 82o+, 72o+, 62o+, 52o+, 42o+, 32o (any pair, any ace, any king, any two broadway, any suited), K2o has about 35% equity. Actually let me estimate: K2o vs top 50% range has about 40% equity. But if opponent is really tight (top 20%), K2o has maybe 30% equity. With my short stack, I might need to gamble.\n\nI should also consider that if I fold, I'll have 110 chips (6.9 BB) and be in SB next hand (posting 8). So I'll have 102 after posting SB, then need to play from SB. That's still very short.\n\nI need to recall opponent tendencies. Let me use the tools to see Seat 5's actions.",

Folding leaves me with 6.9 BB and blinds due soon, giving me little chance to survive. Given tournament desperation and pot odds, calling all-in is the better gamble to double up.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I have more information. Looking at Seat 5's actions: they raised in hands 57 and 58 (amounts 20 and 24), which are small raises. In hand 64 they called 8 (BB) then folded. They've folded a lot recently. Their showdown hands show some decent cards: 8h2h (suited), AdTs, KcAd, KsQs, 8h8c. So they play some reasonable hands.\n\nBut in this hand, they raised to 174 total. That's a huge raise compared to their previous raises of 20-24. With my stack of 126 total, if I've already put in 16 as BB, I have 110 left. The raise to 174 means they're putting in 174 total. If they have more than 174 chips, they're not all-in. But the display says they have 0 chips and are \"out\". That's confusing. Maybe it's a display error and they actually have chips. Or maybe they went all-in with their last chips and the system shows 0 because they're all-in.\n\nGiven the pot is 198 (8+16+174), and I need to call 158 but only have 110 left, I would be calling all-in for my remaining 110. So effectively, I'm getting pot odds of 198:110 = 1.8:1. I need ~35% equity.\n\nK2o is terrible. Against a reasonable all-in range from MP, K2o has maybe 30-35% equity. It's borderline. With my short stack (7.9 BB), I'm in push-or-fold territory. Typically with less than 10 BB, you should be looking to shove with any decent hand, but calling off your stack with K2o is questionable.\n\nHowever, if I fold, I'll have 110 left (6.9 BB). Next hand I'm SB, posting 8, leaving 102 (6.4 BB). Then BB posting 16, leaving 86 (5.4 BB). So I'll be very short and blinded down quickly. I might get a better spot, but time is running out.\n\nGiven the pot odds and my desperate situation, I think I should call. K2o has some chance, and I need to double up soon. The opponent might be stealing with a wider range given my short stack.\n\nBut wait, let me check: the raiser is Seat 5. If they have 0 chips and are \"out\", maybe they're actually eliminated? That doesn't make sense if they just raised. Perhaps the \"0 chips\" is a display error, or they went all-in with their last chips. In either case, I'm getting roughly 2:1 on my money.\n\nI think I should call all-in. It's a gamble, but with my stack size, I need to take some risks. K2o isn't great, but it has some equity against many hands.\n\nFinal decision: call all-in.",

Everyone has folded to me, so it's just me vs the BB (Seat 4: MiniMax-M2). I posted the small blind of 1, and the BB posted 2. I need to call 1 more chip to see the flop, or I can raise or fold.\n\nMy hand: A9 offsuit. This is a decent hand to open from the button, especially with everyone folded to me. I have position advantage on the BB. The BB only has 198 chips, similar to my stack. \n\nI don't have much history on MiniMax-M2 - only one hand where they folded preflop from some position. Since I'm on the button with a decent hand, I should probably raise to put pressure on the BB. A standard button open raise would be 2.5-3x the BB, so 5-6 chips total. Since the minimum raise is to 4 chips (total), I could raise to 5 or 6.\n\nHowever, I also have to consider tournament strategy. With 98.5 BB, I'm deep stacked. A9o is not a premium hand, but it's playable from the button. Calling (completing) the small blind is also an option, but raising is generally better with position.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: I need to call 1 chip to win 3 chips in the pot (my 1 SB + BB's 2 BB). That's 3:1 pot odds, which is excellent. But raising is still better for initiative.\n\nI should raise to build the pot with position. Let me decide on a raise size. Minimum raise is to 4 total (2 more chips). But I'd prefer a standard 2.5x raise, which would be 5 total (3 more chips). Or 3x = 6 total.

My hand is vulnerable and I want to charge draws and get value from worse hands. A bet of 5-8 chips (half to 80% pot) seems reasonable. Since minimum raise is to 3 (which would be a bet of 1 chip more than checking), I should raise to a more meaningful amount.\n\nI'll raise to 8 chips total (betting 7 chips into 10 chip pot, about 70% pot).

Now on the flop, I can check or raise (bet). I should bet for value and protection. The minimum raise is to 3, which means I can bet 1 chip (since checking is 0, raising to 3 means putting in 3 total, which is a bet of 3). Actually wait: amount to call is 0, minimum raise to is 3. That means if I want to bet, I need to raise to at least 3 chips total. So a bet of 3 chips into 10 chip pot is about 30% pot. That's a bit small. I could bet more. Since I'm first to act (well, BB checked to me? Actually no, the action shows: amount to call is 0, so the BB must have checked. The action sequence shows preflop actions only. So on the flop, BB checked, and now it's my action with amount to call 0). So I can check or raise (bet). I should bet for value. A reasonable bet size is 5-8 chips. The minimum raise to is 3, so I can raise to any amount up to my stack. I'll raise to 8 chips total (betting 8 chips). That's a bet of 8 into 10 pot, about 80% pot.

This is a decent hand but vulnerable. The turn brought a Queen, which completes some straight draws (KJ, J9) and gives two pair possibilities (AQ, Q9, Q3). My kicker is weak (9), so I'm losing to any Ace with better kicker.\n\n2. **Board texture:** A-T-Q-3 with two clubs (3c, Ac). The Queen is a scare card that hits many calling ranges. Straight draws: KJ got there, J9 got there. Flush draws: club draw still possible.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** From limited data, MiniMax-M2 folded preflop in Hand #1 with Q5s from BB. In this hand, they called my SB raise preflop and called my flop bet. Their range could include: \n   - Ace-x hands (weaker Aces like A8, A7, A6, A5, A4, A2)\n   - Pocket pairs (TT-22, though TT would likely raise flop)\n   - Straight draws (KJ, J9, maybe K9)\n   - Club draws\n   - Qx hands (QJ, QT, Q9, Q8)\n\n4. **Pot odds:** Pot is 26 chips. If I bet, I need to decide sizing. A continuation bet of 13-18 chips (half to 2/3 pot) seems reasonable.\n\n5. **Position:** I'm in position (BTN), which is advantageous. I can check to control pot size or bet for value/protection.\n\n6. **Stack sizes:** I have 185 chips, opponent has 187. Effective stacks are 185. Pot is 26.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- Checking allows me to see a free river and potentially induce a bluff if opponent missed draws.\n- Betting can get value from weaker Aces, draws, and protect against free cards.\n- With top pair weak kicker, I'm in a marginal spot. The Queen is concerning as it improves many hands that would call flop.\n\nGiven the board texture and my position, I think checking is reasonable. I have showdown value but am vulnerable to many better hands. Checking controls pot size and allows me to evaluate river action. If opponent bets river, I can decide based on bet size and river card.\n\nHowever, I could also make a small bet for value/protection - maybe 12-15 chips. But given the scare card (Q) and my weak kicker, checking seems prudent.\n\nLet's check."

I have three aces with 9 kicker. The board shows A-A-A-3-T-Q\n2. There's a possible straight: T-Q-K would make a straight, but board has A-A-A-3-T-Q, so straight would need K-J\n3.

On the river, the third ace hits, making my hand even stronger but also making it less likely opponent has an ace.\n\nPot is 26 chips. I can check or bet. If I bet, I need to decide size. A small value bet might get called by worse hands like lower aces or even some bluffs. But opponent's range after calling flop and checking turn could include medium pairs, draws that missed, or weak aces.\n\nI should bet small for value. Let's say 12 chips (less than half pot). This might get called by worse aces or bluffs. If raised, I can fold since my kicker is weak.\n\nActually, wait. The board has three aces. What hands would opponent call with? They could have pocket pairs (TT, QQ, 33 for full houses), but those are unlikely. They could have AT, AQ for better kickers. They could have KJs for a straight. But most likely they have a medium pair or a weak ace.\n\nI should bet for value. I'll raise to 12 (total bet of 12). That's a raise of 12 from 0.

Wait, let me calculate carefully.\n\n**Pot calculation:**\n- Preflop: I raised to 5, opponent called 3 more (pot was 5+3+blinds 3 = 11?)\n- Flop: I bet 8, opponent called 8 (pot 11+16=27)\n- Turn: Both checked (pot 27)\n- River: I bet 12, opponent raised 24 (making it 24 total)\n- Current pot before my call: 27 + 12 + 24 = 63? Actually opponent's raise to 24 means they put in 24 total, which is 12 more than my bet. So pot is 27 + 12 + 24 = 63. I need to call 12 more to win 63+12=75 total? Let me recalc:\n\nBetter: After my river bet of 12, pot was 27+12=39. Opponent raised to 24 total, putting in 12 more. So pot is now 39+12=51. I need to call 12 to win 51+12=63.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have trip aces with nine kicker. The board is 3c Ac Th Qd Ad. What could opponent have?\n- They could have a full house: A3, AT, AQ, AA (though AA unlikely as I have one ace)\n- They could have a worse ace: AK, AJ, A8, etc.\n- They could have a straight: KJ (would be Broadway straight A-K-Q-J-T)\n- They could have a flush draw that missed? No flush possible.\n- They could have been slowplaying a strong hand.\n\n**Opponent's line:**\n- Called preflop from BB (defending wide range)\n- Called flop bet on A-high board\n- Checked turn\n- Raised river after I bet\n\nThe river raise is interesting. They checked turn, so likely not a monster hand like full house or straight. But the river ace completes trips for anyone with an ace, and also makes full houses possible for hands like A3, AT, AQ.\n\n**My hand strength:**\nTrip aces with nine kicker is strong but vulnerable to better kickers or full houses. The fact that I have As means opponent can't have AA. But they could have AK, AJ, AT, AQ, A3.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nI need to call 12 to win 63 total (pot of 51 plus my call of 12). That's about 1:5.25 pot odds, or I need ~16% equity.\n\n**Range analysis:**\nWhat hands would opponent play this way?\n- Calling range from BB vs BTN raise: wide range including many aces, suited connectors, pairs\n- Calling flop on A-high board: could have ace, ten, queen, flush draws (none possible), straight draws\n- Checking turn: suggests medium strength or draw\n- Raising river after ace: could be value raising with better ace (AK, AJ, AT, AQ), full house (A3, AT, AQ), or bluff\n\nGiven the board, possible value hands:\n- AK (would raise preflop likely)\n- AJ (might call)\n- AT (makes full house)\n- AQ (makes full house)  \n- A3 (makes full house)\n- KJ (straight)\n- Maybe 33 for full house (would have raised flop or turn likely)\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have 173 chips (86.5 BB), opponent has 163.

Not a huge difference.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the limited data, opponent folded preflop in hand #1. No other history. This is a minimum raise on river, which often indicates medium strength - trying to get value from worse hands but not wanting to risk too much.\n\n**Decision:**\nI think I should call. Reasons:\n1. Pot odds are good (16% equity needed)\n2. My hand is trip aces, which beats many ace-x hands with worse kicker\n3. Opponent could be raising with AJ, A8, A7, etc.\n4.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this more carefully. I have trip aces with nine kicker. The board shows Ac, Ad, 3c, Th, Qd. The river brought the Ad, giving me trip aces. Opponent raised my river bet. \n\nWhat hands would opponent raise river with? They called flop, checked turn, then raised river when the third ace hit. This could be:\n1. A full house (A3, AT, AQ, 33, TT, QQ)\n2. A better ace (AK, AJ, maybe AT if they slowplayed)\n3. A bluff/semi-bluff\n\nThe fact they checked turn suggests they don't have a monster hand like a full house already on the turn. But the river ace makes full houses for many hands: A3, AT, AQ. Also 33 makes a full house but would likely have raised earlier.\n\nMy hand is essentially trip aces with nine kicker. If opponent has an ace with a better kicker (AK, AJ, AT, AQ), I lose. If opponent has a full house, I lose. If opponent has a worse ace (A8, A7, A6, A5, A4, A2), I win. If opponent is bluffing, I win.\n\nGiven the pot odds (call 12 to win 63), I need about 16% equity. Even if opponent only raises with better aces and full houses, I might still have some equity against bluffs or worse aces they think are value.\n\nBut wait, opponent made a minimum raise. This is often a value bet sizing - they want a call from worse hands. They're not trying to blow me off the hand.\n\nI should consider my own line: I raised preflop from BTN, bet flop, checked turn, bet river small. My line looks weak - like I have a medium ace or maybe missed. Opponent might be exploiting this.\n\nActually, let me calculate the pot size more carefully:\n- Preflop: I raised to 5, opponent called 3 more. Blinds were 1/2. So pot after preflop: 5 (my raise) + 3 (opponent's call) + 1 (SB) + 2 (BB) = 11\n- Flop: I bet 8, opponent called 8. Pot: 11 + 8 + 8 = 27\n- Turn: Both checked. Pot: 27\n- River: I bet 12, opponent raised to 24 total (so they put in 24, which is 12 more than my bet). Pot before my action: 27 + 12 + 24 = 63\n- I need to call 12 to win 63 + 12 = 75? Actually no, I'm calling 12 to win the pot of 63. So pot odds are 12:63 = 1:5.25, meaning I need ~16% equity.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and stack sizes, calling 12 chips (6 BB) to potentially win 63 chips (31.5 BB) seems reasonable even if I'm behind sometimes.\n\nBut what's the risk? If I call and lose, I'm at 161 chips. If I fold, I'm at 161 chips (since I already put in 12). Wait no - I already bet 12 on river. So if I fold now, I lose that 12. My stack would be 173 - 12 = 161. If I call and lose, I lose another 12, so 173 - 24 = 149. Actually, I've already put in: preflop 5, flop 8, river 12 = 25 total. My stack is 173, so I have 148 left? Let me track better.\n\nStarting stack: 173\nPreflop: raised to 5 \u2192 168 left\nFlop: bet 8 \u2192 160 left  \nRiver: bet 12 \u2192 148 left\nNow facing raise of 12 more \u2192 if I call, I'd have 136 left. If I fold, I have 148 left.\n\nSo the decision is: risk 12 more chips (going from 148 to 136) to win pot of 63. That's risking 12 to win 63, or ~5.25:1 odds.\n\nGiven these odds, I think I should call. Even if I'm behind to better aces or full houses sometimes, I might still win against worse aces or bluffs often enough to make it profitable.\n\nFinal decision: call.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have some information about opponents. MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, SB) has shown some aggression - called a raise preflop in hand 2, called a flop bet, then raised on the river. GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, BB) has folded both hands preflop so far.\n\nMy hand is 9d Kh from the button. This is a marginal hand - K9o is not great, but being on the button with position is advantageous. The pot is 3 chips, I need to call 2 chips to see the flop. I have 235 chips (117.5 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\nConsidering my position and the fact that both blinds are relatively short-stacked (MiniMax-M2 has 162 chips, GPT-OSS-120B has 198 chips), I could consider raising to steal the blinds. However, K9o is not a great hand for raising, especially since MiniMax-M2 has shown some willingness to call and play postflop.\n\nThe minimum raise would be to 4 chips total. If I raise, I risk getting called by one or both blinds and playing a marginal hand out of position postflop (though I do have position on them).\n\nGiven the tournament context and my stack size, I should probably just fold this marginal hand. K9o doesn't play well multi-way, and I don't want to get involved with a weak hand. Better to wait for a better spot.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any value in calling to see a flop. For 2 chips (less than 1% of my stack), I could see a flop with position. If I hit a king or a good draw, I could continue. But K9o flops poorly - often top pair weak kicker which is hard to play.\n\nActually, given that I'm on the button and the blinds are relatively short, a small raise might be okay. But with K9o, I think folding is the disciplined play.\n\nWait, let me think about stack sizes again. I have 235 chips, SB has 162, BB has 198. A raise to 6 chips (3x) would be reasonable. If both fold, I win 3 chips. If called, I have position.\n\nBut actually, looking at opponent tendencies: GPT-OSS-120B has folded both hands preflop, so likely tight. MiniMax-M2 called a raise in hand 2, but that was from earlier position. As SB facing a button raise, he might defend wider.\n\nI think the conservative play is to fold. K9o is just too weak. I'll preserve my chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with 6c7c suited. The action: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) limped, then Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 6 total (so a raise of 4 more after posting SB 1). I need to call 4 chips to continue.\n\nMy hand: 6c7c suited is a speculative hand. It's not strong preflop but has good potential to make straights and flushes. I'm getting decent pot odds: pot is 10 (2 BB + 2 from limper + 6 from raiser), I need to call 4, so pot odds are 10:4 or 2.5:1, which means I need ~28.6% equity.\n\nAgainst a typical raising range, 67s has about 30-35% equity against a tight range, and better against a wider range. However, I'm out of position (BB) against two opponents (raiser and limper who might call).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has shown some aggression with a raise in hand #4. Limped this hand, could be trapping or playing speculative.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Showed aggression in hand #5 with a raise to 14 preflop and continuation betting. This raise to 6 is smaller, could be a wider range.\n\nMy stack is 233 chips (116.5 BB) - deep stacked. The raiser has 169 chips (84.5 BB). If I call, I'll be playing a multiway pot out of position with a speculative hand.\n\nGiven the pot odds and implied odds (deep stacks), calling could be reasonable. However, 67s plays much better in position. Being in the BB against a raiser and potential caller is tough.\n\nAlternative: I could consider a 3-bet to take initiative, but 67s is not a great 3-betting hand, especially out of position.\n\nGiven the decent pot odds and deep stacks, I think calling is reasonable. Folding is also fine since the hand is marginal out of position.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns I should consider.",

Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking. Both seem to be AI players. Without specific reads, I should consider standard play.\n\nGiven I have 116.5 BB, calling 4 chips is a small investment.

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is still in the hand. I have 229 chips (114.5 BB). \n\nMy hand: 6c7c is a suited connector, but only middle suited connector. Flop is 8c Ts Ks. I have a gutshot straight draw (9 needed for straight: 9-J-Q would give me a straight, but I need 9 specifically for a straight? Actually 6-7-8-9-T would be a straight, so I have an open-ended straight draw? Wait: 6-7-8-9-T is a straight, yes. I need a 9. Also 5-6-7-8-9 would be a straight, so I need a 9 or a 5. Actually 5 would give me 5-6-7-8, that's only a four-card straight. I need a 9 for the open-ended straight draw: 6-7-8-9-T. So I have an open-ended straight draw (8 outs). I also have a backdoor flush draw with two clubs (I have 6c7c, board has 8c Ts Ks - only one club on board, so backdoor flush draw). \n\nI have middle pair? No, I have 6 and 7, board is 8-T-K. No pair. So I have a draw.\n\nPosition: I'm in BB, last to act after Seat 2 checked. Seat 1 hasn't acted yet? Wait, the action order: preflop: Seat 2 (SB) raised, I called, Seat 1 called. Flop: Seat 2 checked. Now it's on Seat 1? Actually the description says \"flop: Seat 2 check\". Then \"Amount to call: 0\". That suggests it's my turn to act? But there are three players: Seat 1, Seat 2, and me (Seat 3). Seat 2 checked, so action goes to Seat 1? But maybe Seat 1 already acted? Let's see: The actions listed: preflop actions include Seat 1 call 2, Seat 2 raise 6, Seat 3 call 4, Seat 1 call 4. So Seat 1 is still in. On flop, only Seat 2 check is listed. That might mean Seat 1 checked? Or maybe Seat 1 hasn't acted yet? In typical order, after SB (Seat 2) checks, it goes to BB (me) if UTG (Seat 1) already acted? Actually preflop order: UTG (Seat 1) called, SB raised, BB called, UTG called. On flop, SB checks, then UTG acts, then BB. But the \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests there's no bet to call, so either UTG checked or hasn't acted yet. The interface might be showing me my action now because it's my turn after UTG checked. Probably Seat 1 checked as well, but not listed. Let me assume Seat 1 checked, so it's on me.\n\nThus I can check, raise, or fold. Folding is silly with a draw. I could check to see a free turn, or raise to semi-bluff. I need to consider opponent tendencies.\n\nLet me use tools to recall opponent actions. First, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop from SB. Let's see their tendencies. Use recall_opponent_actions for Seat 2.",

Seat 1 still to act after me.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop to 6 (3x BB). In hand #5, they raised to 14 preflop (7x BB) and then bet flop. Now they raised smaller and checked flop. This could indicate a weaker hand or they're checking to the preflop raiser (me? Actually I'm BB, seat 2 was SB who raised). Wait, seat 2 was SB who raised preflop, so they're the aggressor. Their check could be a check to the caller (me) or they might be checking a medium-strength hand.\n\nI have a draw: gutshot to a straight (need a 9) and backdoor flush. Not much equity right now. With two opponents, I should be cautious.\n\nGiven the board is K-T-8 with two spades, there are many better hands that could be out there: pairs of K, T, 8, flush draws, straight draws.\n\nSince amount to call is 0, I can check for free and see what seat 1 does. If I raise, I'd be bluffing with little equity, and seat 1 might call or raise with a better hand.\n\nBetter to check and see the turn. If I hit my draw on the turn, I can consider betting. Checking preserves my stack and allows me to realize my equity cheaply.\n\nDecision: Check.",

          "content": "I need to analyze this hand. I'm in the BB with 6c7c. Preflop: SB raised to 6 total (so min-raise from SB), I called from BB with 6c7s suited, UTG (Seat 1) called. Flop: 8c Ts Ks. SB checks, I check, UTG bets 28, SB raises to 80 (so raise of 52). Now action to me. Pot is 126 preflop? Let's calculate: Preflop: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, UTG called 2, SB raised to 6 total (so added 4), I called 4 more, UTG called 4 more. So pot preflop: 1+2+2+6+4+4 = 19? Wait that's not right. Let's compute: SB: 1 (post) + 5 (raise) = 6 total. BB: 2 (post) + 4 (call) = 6 total. UTG: 2 (call) + 4 (call) = 6 total. So pot preflop is 18. Then flop: UTG bets 28, SB raises to 80 (so adds 52 more). Current pot before my action: 18 + 28 + 80 = 126. Yes matches pot size given. Now I need to call 80. My stack is 229, so I have 229 - 6 = 223 left? Actually I already put in 6 preflop (2 BB post + 4 call). So I have 223 chips left. Calling 80 would leave me with 143. Pot after my call would be 126 + 80 = 206. If I call, there's still UTG to act behind me (Seat 1). He bet 28 and now faces a raise to 80. He could call, raise, or fold.\n\nMy hand: 6c7c on board 8c Ts Ks. I have a gutshot straight draw (9 gives me a straight: 9c? Actually 9 gives me 6-7-8-9-T straight, but board is 8-T-K, so I need a 9. That's 4 outs. Also I have a backdoor flush draw with two clubs (I have 6c7c, board has 8c Ts Ks - one club on board). So backdoor club flush draw. Also possibly a pair if I hit 6 or 7, but that's weak. So essentially a gutshot with backdoor flush. Not great.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 80 to win 206 (pot after my call). That's about 2.575:1 odds, or about 28% equity needed. My equity against likely ranges? Let's estimate. SB raised preflop from SB, UTG called pre then bet flop, SB check-raised. SB's range: could be strong: sets (88, TT, KK maybe? KK unlikely preflop raise small? But possible), two pair (K8, KT, K8s?), strong draws like AsQs, maybe pair+draw. UTG's range: could be top pair, draws, maybe middle pair. My equity against these ranges is likely low. Gutshot has 4 outs, but some outs may be dirty if someone has a flush draw. Clubs are somewhat clean but backdoor only. So I need about 28% equity. I doubt I have that.\n\nImplied odds: If I hit my straight on turn, I could win more chips. But stack sizes: SB has 89 total, he already put in 80? Wait SB's stack is 89. He raised to 80, so he has 9 left. Actually preflop he put in 6, now raised to 80 total? Let's compute: SB's stack is 89. Preflop he put in 6. So he has 83 left. He raised to 80 total? The action: \"Seat 2 raise 80\". That's the total amount he's putting in? In the description, \"raise 80\" likely means he raises to 80 total (i.e., adds 80 to his previous bet). But he checked, so his previous bet is 0. Actually he checked, then UTG bet 28, then SB raises to 80. That means SB puts in 80 total (i.e., adds 80 to the pot). So his remaining stack is 89 - 80 = 9. So he's basically all-in (he has 9 left). So SB is nearly all-in. UTG has 165 stack, bet 28, now faces raise to 80, so needs to call 52 more. He has plenty behind.\n\nThus"

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to decide. Let's analyze:\n\nMy hand: 6c7c on 8c Ts Ks. I have a gutshot to a 9 (4 outs). Backdoor flush draw (need two clubs). Weak pair outs (6 or 7) likely not good.\n\nOpponent ranges:\n- Seat 2 (SB): He raised preflop from SB. His previous actions: Hand #5 he raised preflop to 14 (larger raise). Now he raised to 6 preflop (smaller). He check-raised flop aggressively, putting almost all his stack in (80 total, leaving 9). This looks very strong: likely top pair (KT, K8?), two pair, set, or strong draw like flush draw with AsQs maybe. He's committing his stack.\n\n- Seat 1 (UTG): He called preflop, bet flop 28 into 18 pot (big bet). He's facing a raise now. He could have top pair, middle pair, draw. He might fold or call.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 80 to win 206 (pot after my call). That's 80/206 = 38.8% equity needed. Actually pot odds: 80 to win 126 currently? Wait: pot before my call is 126. I need to call 80. If I call, pot becomes 206. My contribution is 80, so I need to win 80 out of 206, which is 38.8%. But if UTG also calls behind me, pot becomes larger, improving odds. But he might re-raise.\n\nEquity estimate: Gutshot straight draw (4 outs) ~ 8% per card, so 16% to hit by river. Backdoor flush draw adds maybe 4%. Pair outs maybe 6% but likely not clean. So total maybe 20-25% equity. Not enough for 38% required.\n\nImplied odds: If I hit my straight on turn, SB is almost all-in, so I can only win his remaining 9 chips. UTG has more chips but might not pay off if board gets scary. So implied odds are poor.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 229 chips (114.5 BB). This is a deep stack tournament. Folding leaves me with 223 chips (111.5 BB). Calling and losing leaves me with 143 chips (71.5 BB). That's still okay but significant loss.\n\nPosition: I'm out of position for rest of hand.\n\nOpponent tendencies: Seat 2 (SB) has shown aggression (raised preflop in hand #5, bet flop). Seat 1 (UTG) has been tight (folded many hands, only raised once preflop in hand #4).\n\nGiven all this, folding is correct. My hand is weak, pot odds not favorable, implied odds poor, and I'm facing strong action.\n\nThus, I should fold.",

Only the small blind and big blind are in the hand - I posted the small blind of 1, and MiniMax-M2 posted the big blind of 2. Everyone else folded. I need to call 1 more chip to see the flop.\n\nLooking at the opponent data: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has shown some aggression - they raised to 4 in hand #5 and hand #8 from the BB position when facing a limp or small bet. They also called a raise in hand #5 and continued postflop. So they're not overly tight.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 5s is a small pocket pair. From the button with only the BB left to act, this is a decent spot. The key is set mining - trying to hit a set on the flop (about 12% chance). With implied odds, if I hit my set, I could win a big pot.\n\nStack sizes: I have 232 chips, opponent has 197 chips. If I just call the 1 chip, the pot will be 3 chips preflop. If I raise, I could take it down preflop or build a pot.\n\nConsidering my position advantage (button), I could raise to try to steal the blinds. However, pocket 5s doesn't play well postflop if I miss, and I'm out of position against the BB if I just call.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n1. Fold: Too tight. Pocket 5s is playable from button vs BB.\n2. Call: Set mining for 1 chip more. Good implied odds if I hit.\n3. Raise: Could be good for stealing, but risks getting called or re-raised.\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to sometimes raise from BB, if I just call, they might raise. But actually, I'm the one acting - they've already posted BB and checked their option. So if I call, they'll check and we'll see a flop.\n\nI think calling is reasonable for set mining. The price is only 1 chip to potentially win 197 chips (opponent's stack). That's 1:197 implied odds, which is excellent for set mining (need about 1:10 to 1:15).\n\nHowever, raising to 4-6 chips could also be good. It might take it down preflop, and if called, I have position.\n\nLooking at my history: In hand #7 from BTN with KTs, I raised to 10 and won the blinds. So I've shown aggression from button before.\n\nI think a small raise is best here. Pocket 5s has some value, and I want to take initiative with position. If I get called, I can c-bet on favorable flops or check back on bad ones.\n\nLet's raise to 6 total (adding 5 more). This is a reasonable sizing - 3x the BB."

          "reasoning_content": "I'm in the button position with pocket 5s. I have 232 chips (116 BB), which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2. Only the small blind and big blind are in the hand - I posted the small blind of 1, and MiniMax-M2 posted the big blind of 2. Everyone else folded. I need to call 1 more chip to see the flop.\n\nLooking at the opponent data: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has shown some aggression - they raised to 4 in hand #5 and hand #8 from the BB position when facing a limp or small bet. They also called a raise in hand #5 and continued postflop. So they're not overly tight.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 5s is a small pocket pair. From the button with only the BB left to act, this is a decent spot. The key is set mining - trying to hit a set on the flop (about 12% chance). With implied odds, if I hit my set, I could win a big pot.\n\nStack sizes: I have 232 chips, opponent has 197 chips. If I just call the 1 chip, the pot will be 3 chips preflop. If I raise, I could take it down preflop or build a pot.\n\nConsidering my position advantage (button), I could raise to try to steal the blinds. However, pocket 5s doesn't play well postflop if I miss, and I'm out of position against the BB if I just call.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n1. Fold: Too tight. Pocket 5s is playable from button vs BB.\n2. Call: Set mining for 1 chip more. Good implied odds if I hit.\n3. Raise: Could be good for stealing, but risks getting called or re-raised.\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to sometimes raise from BB, if I just call, they might raise. But actually, I'm the one acting - they've already posted BB and checked their option. So if I call, they'll check and we'll see a flop.\n\nI think calling is reasonable for set mining. The price is only 1 chip to potentially win 197 chips (opponent's stack). That's 1:197 implied odds, which is excellent for set mining (need about 1:10 to 1:15).\n\nHowever, raising to 4-6 chips could also be good. It might take it down preflop, and if called, I have position.\n\nLooking at my history: In hand #7 from BTN with KTs, I raised to 10 and won the blinds. So I've shown aggression from button before.\n\nI think a small raise is best here. Pocket 5s has some value, and I want to take initiative with position. If I get called, I can c-bet on favorable flops or check back on bad ones.\n\nLet's raise to 6 total (adding 5 more). This is a reasonable sizing - 3x the BB.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to provide a JSON response. Let me structure it properly. I'm playing pocket 5s from the button. The BB has already checked their option (they posted BB and it's on me to act). I need to call 1 chip to see the flop. My options: fold, call, or raise.\n\nGiven my analysis: pocket 5s is a small pair good for set mining. Calling 1 chip gives me great implied odds (1:197). However, raising could be better to take initiative with position. The opponent has shown some aggression but not excessive.\n\nActually, wait - I'm in the small blind, not the button. The user said \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\" but then says \"Seat 3 post_sb 1\". That means I'm actually in the small blind, not the button. Let me re-read: \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\" but actions show \"Seat 3 post_sb 1\". This is confusing. If I posted SB, then I'm in the small blind, not button. But it says BTN. Maybe there's a mislabeling. In typical poker, SB posts 1, BB posts 2, button doesn't post. So if I posted SB, I'm SB, not BTN.\n\nActually looking at the players: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded, I'm Seat 3, Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, Seat 5 folded. So I'm in the small blind (seat 3), MiniMax is in BB (seat 4). That means I'm out of position postflop if I just call. That changes things.\n\nIf I'm out of position, set mining is less attractive because I can't control the pot as well. Raising might be better to take initiative. Or folding might be reasonable since pocket 5s out of position isn't great.\n\nBut the price is only 1 chip. With 232 chips, calling 1 chip to set mine is fine even out of position. If I miss, I can check-fold. If I hit, I can check-raise or lead out.\n\nActually, in the small blind facing just the BB, I should complete the blind (call the additional 1). That's standard with any reasonable hand. Pocket 5s is definitely worth completing.\n\nSo I'll call. No need to raise out of position with a small pair.\n\nBut wait, I could also raise to try to take it down preflop. Since I'm out of position, raising might be better to take control. But pocket 5s doesn't play well postflop if I raise and get called.\n\nI think completing (calling) is standard. Let me call.\n\nResponse should be JSON. Action: call (since amount to call is 1). Raise_to: null. Reasoning: brief explanation.\n\nLet me craft the JSON.",

The board is relatively dry with no straight possibilities (except maybe 46 for a gutshot, but that's unlikely). There's a flush draw with two clubs.\n\nI'm heads-up against MiniMax-M2 in the BB. The pot is 4 chips, and I have 231 chips (115.5 BB). MiniMax-M2 has 197 chips. I'm in position, which is great.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's tendencies from the data:\n- They've shown some aggression with raises preflop (hands 5, 8)\n- They've made continuation bets on flops (hand 8)\n- They've shown willingness to call bets with draws or pairs (hand 5)\n- They've also folded to aggression (hand 5 on turn)\n\nGiven that I have a set, I want to build the pot. Since the pot is only 4 chips and I'm in position, I have several options:\n\n1. Check: This might induce a bluff from MiniMax-M2, but with such a small pot, it might not build much value.\n2. Bet small: A small bet (2-4 chips) could look like a probe bet and might get called by many hands.\n3. Bet larger: A bigger bet (6-8 chips) could build the pot faster.\n\nConsidering the board texture (dry with a flush draw), and my strong hand, I should bet to build the pot. MiniMax-M2 might call with any piece of the board (any 8, any 5, any 3, flush draws, straight draws).\n\nGiven my position and stack sizes, I think a small to medium bet is appropriate. Let's say 4 chips (pot-sized bet). This would make the pot 8 chips total, and if called, we'd have a 12 chip pot going to the turn.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions: I can check or raise (since amount to call is 0). I should bet to build the pot. Let me check the minimum raise is 2, but I can raise to any amount up to my stack.\n\nI think I'll make a small bet to start building the pot. Let's go with 4 chips (pot-sized bet). This is reasonable and not too scary."

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I have 55 on the BTN, and the flop is 3c 8c 5d. I flopped bottom set! This is a very strong hand. The board is relatively dry with no straight possibilities (except maybe 46 for a gutshot, but that's unlikely). There's a flush draw with two clubs.\n\nI'm heads-up against MiniMax-M2 in the BB. The pot is 4 chips, and I have 231 chips (115.5 BB). MiniMax-M2 has 197 chips. I'm in position, which is great.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's tendencies from the data:\n- They've shown some aggression with raises preflop (hands 5, 8)\n- They've made continuation bets on flops (hand 8)\n- They've shown willingness to call bets with draws or pairs (hand 5)\n- They've also folded to aggression (hand 5 on turn)\n\nGiven that I have a set, I want to build the pot. Since the pot is only 4 chips and I'm in position, I have several options:\n\n1. Check: This might induce a bluff from MiniMax-M2, but with such a small pot, it might not build much value.\n2. Bet small: A small bet (2-4 chips) could look like a probe bet and might get called by many hands.\n3. Bet larger: A bigger bet (6-8 chips) could build the pot faster.\n\nConsidering the board texture (dry with a flush draw), and my strong hand, I should bet to build the pot. MiniMax-M2 might call with any piece of the board (any 8, any 5, any 3, flush draws, straight draws).\n\nGiven my position and stack sizes, I think a small to medium bet is appropriate. Let's say 4 chips (pot-sized bet). This would make the pot 8 chips total, and if called, we'd have a 12 chip pot going to the turn.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions: I can check or raise (since amount to call is 0). I should bet to build the pot. Let me check the minimum raise is 2, but I can raise to any amount up to my stack.\n\nI think I'll make a small bet to start building the pot. Let's go with 4 chips (pot-sized bet). This is reasonable and not too scary.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to output a JSON object. Let me structure my response properly. I have bottom set on a dry board, I'm in position, and I want to build the pot. The action is to raise (bet) since there's no bet to call. I should decide on a raise amount.\n\nThe pot is 4 chips. A standard bet might be 2-4 chips. A pot-sized bet would be 4 chips. That seems reasonable. I'll raise to 6 total (which is a bet of 4, since I already have 1 in from SB and need to add 5 more? Wait, let me think.\n\nI posted SB 1, then called 1 more preflop, so I have 2 chips in the pot already. The pot is 4 chips total. If I want to bet 4 chips, that means I need to raise to 6 total (2 already in + 4 more). But actually, since amount to call is 0, if I raise to 6, that's putting 6 total chips in, which means adding 4 more to my current 2.\n\nActually, simpler: I can just think of the bet size. I want to bet 4 chips. So raise_to should be my current investment (2) plus the bet (4) = 6.\n\nLet me check: I have 2 chips in already (SB 1 + call 1). Pot is 4. If I bet 4, total pot becomes 8, and I'd have 6 chips total in. So raise_to: 6.\n\nYes, that's correct. Now for the reasoning: I have bottom set on a dry board, in position against one opponent. I want to build the pot and charge any draws. A pot-sized bet is appropriate to start building the pot while not scaring away marginal hands.\n\nI'll output the JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation carefully. I'm on the BTN with pocket 5s. The board is 3c 8c 5d 3s. I have a full house! 5s full of 3s. That's an extremely strong hand - only quads or a higher full house (8s full or pocket 8s or 3s) beat me.\n\nThe pot is 16 chips. I'm first to act on the turn. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise. The minimum raise is to 6 total (which would be a bet of 6 since there's no bet to call).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has shown some aggression. In hand #5, they bet 74 on the turn. In hand #8, they bet 6 on the flop. They've shown willingness to bet when they have something.\n\nOn the flop, I bet 6 and they called. They could have:\n1. A flush draw (clubs)\n2. A straight draw (maybe 46, 67)\n3. A pair (8, 3, or maybe overcards)\n4. A slow-played monster (88, 33)\n\nGiven the board has paired 3s, many draws are still possible. The flush draw (clubs) is still there. Straight draws need a 6 or 7.\n\nWith my full house, I want to extract value. I should bet to charge draws and get value from pairs. Since I'm first to act, I could check to induce a bluff from MiniMax-M2, but given their tendency to bet on the turn in hand #5, they might take a stab if I check.\n\nHowever, with such a strong hand, I should probably bet for value. The pot is 16, so a bet of around 8-12 seems reasonable. I have position (BTN) and will act last on the river.\n\nConsidering stack sizes: I have 225, opponent has 191. A bet of 10-12 would be reasonable. I'll go with 12 to charge draws and build the pot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 12,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Have 5s full of 3s - extremely strong hand. Want to charge flush draws and get value from pairs. Pot is 16, bet of 12 builds pot for river value.

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted the small blind (1 chip), Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted the big blind (2 chips), and Seat 1 folded. So I'm first to act preflop after the blinds.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised preflop in 2 out of 10 hands (Hands 5 and 8), both times to 4 chips. This suggests they might be aggressive from the small blind.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) hasn't raised preflop yet, but we only have limited data.\n\nI have pocket Kings, which is the second-best starting hand in Texas Hold'em (only behind Aces). This is a premium hand that I want to build a pot with. I'm on the button, which is the best position postflop.\n\nGiven my strong hand and position, I should raise. The minimum raise is to 4 chips, but with Kings I want to make a larger raise to build the pot and potentially isolate one opponent. Standard raise sizes in tournaments are often 2.5-3x the big blind, but with Kings I might go larger.\n\nMy stack is 241 chips (120.5 BB), so I have plenty of chips. The blinds are small relative to my stack. I should consider raising to 6-8 chips (3-4x BB). Since Seat 4 (SB) has shown aggression with raises to 4 chips, they might call or re-raise. Seat 5 (BB) might defend their blind.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (120.5 BB), so I can afford to play this hand aggressively. Pocket Kings is a hand worth accumulating chips with.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips (3x BB). This is a standard raise size that builds the pot while not committing too much. If I get re-raised, I can consider going all-in depending on the action.\n\nWait, actually looking at the action: Seat 4 posted SB (1), Seat 5 posted BB (2), Seat 1 folded. So I'm first to act. The amount to call is 2 (the BB). Minimum raise is to 4 (double the BB). I can raise to any amount up to my stack.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips total (adding 4 more to the 2 to call). This is a 3x BB raise.",

I need to call 2 to match the BB, or raise to at least 4.\n\nThis is an extremely strong hand preflop - second best starting hand only to aces. I'm on the button, which is the best position. Looking at the opponents: MiniMax-M2 (SB, seat 4) and GPT-OSS-120B (BB, seat 5). From the search results, I can see both opponents have been playing reasonably - MiniMax-M2 raised with Td 2d from UTG in hand 8, which is a bit loose. GPT-OSS-120B folded in most situations.\n\nWith pocket kings, I definitely want to raise to build the pot and get value. A standard raise would be 3-4x the BB, so 6-8 chips. Since minimum raise is to 4, I should raise more to get value and potentially isolate one opponent.\n\nMy stack is 241 chips, opponents have 190 and 191. I have a slight chip lead. I want to build a pot but not scare everyone away. Let me think about sizing: if I raise to 8 (4x BB), that's a reasonable size. Or I could go to 10 like I did in hand 7 with Kh Th.\n\nActually, looking at hand 7, I raised to 10 from button with Kh Th and won the blinds. That was successful. With KK, I should raise even more for value.\n\nI'll raise to 10-12 chips.

The blinds are 1/2, so I have plenty of room to maneuver.\n\nA7s is not a great UTG hand. It has some potential with flush possibilities, but it's dominated by many better aces (AJ+, AT+, A9s). From UTG, I should be playing tighter.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 raised from UTG with T2d (suited) in hand #8, showing they might play somewhat loose from early position\n- GPT-OSS-120B has folded to all raises so far\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking called a min-raise from BB in hand #8\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, the standard play is to fold A7s from UTG. However, I could consider a raise to 10-12 chips (5-6 BB) to try to steal the blinds, but with two players behind who might call or 3-bet, that's risky.\n\nLet me check my own history to see if I've been playing aggressively.",

This is their first aggressive action (raise to 30). This suggests they have a strong hand given their tight folding pattern.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has raised preflop twice before (both small raises to 4), and called my raise.\n\nMy hand: Pocket Tens is a strong hand, but vulnerable to overcards. With a 3-bet from a previously tight player (GPT-OSS-120B), I need to be cautious. The pot is 51 chips, and I need to call 20 more. That's pot odds of 20 to win 71 (51+20), or about 3.55:1, which is good.\n\nHowever, I'm out of position (SB), and there's still Seat 4 to act after me. If I call, Seat 4 might come along or re-raise.\n\nStack sizes: I have 234 total. I've already put in 12 chips (2 BB + 10 raise). Calling 20 more would put 32 total, leaving 202 behind. Raising to 50 would put 50 total, leaving 184 behind.\n\nGiven GPT-OSS-120B's tight folding history, their 3-bet likely represents a strong range: JJ+, AK, maybe AQs. My Tens are behind QQ+, tied with JJ, ahead of TT (same), and ahead of AK/AQ.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (117 BB). Folding preserves my stack. Calling keeps the pot manageable but puts me out of position. Raising commits more chips and could lead to a 4-bet or all-in from the tight player.\n\nGiven the tight player's first aggressive move, I should be cautious. However, pocket Tens is a strong hand, and the pot odds are good. I think calling is reasonable to see a flop and reassess. If I hit a set (22% chance), I can stack them. If the flop comes with overcards, I can proceed cautiously.\n\nActually, let me check if there's any more history on these opponents. Let me search for showdowns."

This is their first aggressive action (raise to 30). This suggests they have a strong hand given their tight folding pattern.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has raised preflop twice before (both small raises to 4), and called my raise.\n\nMy hand: Pocket Tens is a strong hand, but vulnerable to overcards. With a 3-bet from a previously tight player (GPT-OSS-120B), I need to be cautious. The pot is 51 chips, and I need to call 20 more. That's pot odds of 20 to win 71 (51+20), or about 3.55:1, which is good.\n\nHowever, I'm out of position (SB), and there's still Seat 4 to act after me. If I call, Seat 4 might come along or re-raise.\n\nStack sizes: I have 234 total. I've already put in 12 chips (2 BB + 10 raise). Calling 20 more would put 32 total, leaving 202 behind. Raising to 50 would put 50 total, leaving 184 behind.\n\nGiven GPT-OSS-120B's tight folding history, their 3-bet likely represents a strong range: JJ+, AK, maybe AQs. My Tens are behind QQ+, tied with JJ, ahead of TT (same), and ahead of AK/AQ.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (117 BB). Folding preserves my stack. Calling keeps the pot manageable but puts me out of position. Raising commits more chips and could lead to a 4-bet or all-in from the tight player.\n\nGiven the tight player's first aggressive move, I should be cautious. However, pocket Tens is a strong hand, and the pot odds are good. I think calling is reasonable to see a flop and reassess. If I hit a set (22% chance), I can stack them. If the flop comes with overcards, I can proceed cautiously.\n\nActually, let me check if there's any more history on these opponents. Let me search for showdowns.",

The only hands I'm beating are smaller pairs (99, 88, etc.) and maybe some draws.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, out of position against seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) who is the only other player in the hand.\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at the recall data, seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been very tight - folding preflop in 11 out of 12 hands, and only seeing a flop once in hand 3 where they had 8h2h and checked all streets. In hand 4, they called 1 chip (likely the SB) then folded to a raise. This suggests they're playing very conservatively.\n\n4. **Action this hand**: Preflop, seat 4 called, seat 5 called, I raised to 10 from BB, seat 4 called, then seat 5 raised to 30, I called 20 more, seat 4 folded. So seat 5's 3-bet to 30 is significant - they put in 30 total when facing my 10 raise. With their tight tendencies, this 3-bet likely represents a strong hand.\n\n5. **Board texture**: As Jh 7c - Ace high, rainbow likely (no flush draws). This hits a lot of strong hands that seat 5 could have 3-bet with: AA, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe AJ.\n\n6. **Stack sizes**: I have 214 chips, seat 5 has 160 chips. Pot is 71 chips.\n\n7. **Current action**: It's the flop, amount to call is 0, I can check or raise. Given the Ace on board and seat 5's tight 3-betting range, checking seems prudent.\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: I have 214 chips (107 BB), which is a decent stack. No need to get involved in a marginal spot against what appears to be a strong hand.\n\nGiven seat 5's tight tendencies and their preflop 3-bet, they likely have a strong hand that connects well with this A-high board. My pocket tens are in bad shape against their range (AA, JJ, AK, AQ, maybe AJ). Even if they have QQ or KK, I'm still behind. Best case is they have a smaller pair like 99 or 88, but that seems unlikely given their 3-bet.\n\nI should check and see what they do. If they bet small, I might consider calling to see a turn, but if they bet big, I should likely fold. For now, check and evaluate.",

I have middle pair with poor kicker\n5. I have a healthy stack to preserve\n\nI should fold. The risk/reward isn't favorable.\n\nHowever, let me consider if there's any chance they're bluffing. Given their tight folding history, this seems unlikely. They've waited for a hand and are now playing it aggressively.\n\nI'll fold.",

From the opponent action data:\n\n- MiniMax-M2 has mostly folded preflop, called twice (once in hand 13 where there was a lot of action)\n- GPT-OSS-120B has mostly folded preflop, but showed aggression in hand 13 with a raise to 30 and a big bet on the flop\n\nI'm on the button, which is a great position, but with 72o, this hand has almost no value.

I have a healthy stack (213 chips, 106.5 BB), so there's no need to get involved with such a bad hand.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern of the blinds folding to button raises... Actually, from the data, both blinds have shown willingness to defend. MiniMax-M2 folded a lot but also called.

If I raise to say 6 chips (standard 3x), I'm risking 6 to win 3. If either blind calls or 3-bets, I'm in a terrible spot with 72o.\n\nBetter to just fold this trash hand and wait for a better spot. I have a healthy stack (213 chips, 106.5 BB), so there's no need to get involved with such a bad hand.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern of the blinds folding to button raises... Actually, from the data, both blinds have shown willingness to defend. MiniMax-M2 folded a lot but also called. GPT-OSS-120B showed aggression in hand 13.\n\nGiven all this, folding is clearly the best play.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3s 2d - This is an extremely weak hand. 32o is one of the worst possible starting hands in poker. It has very little potential to make strong hands postflop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the small blind. This is a terrible position to play marginal hands from because I'll be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 213 chips (106.5 BB) - Healthy stack, no need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Opponent action**: Kimi-K2 Thinking raised to 6 from UTG+1 (seat 1). Looking at their history, they've raised once before in hand #14 (same 6 chip raise). They've mostly been folding preflop (6 out of 7 hands). This suggests they might have a decent hand when they do raise.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 5 chips to win 9, which is 1.8:1 odds (need ~35.7% equity). My hand has nowhere near that against a likely raising range.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should avoid playing weak hands out of position against early position raises. The blinds are small relative to our stack (106.5 BB), so there's no pressure to accumulate chips urgently.\n\n7. **The BB still to act**: MiniMax-M2 in the BB still has to act after me. They could potentially re-raise, making my situation even worse.\n\n8. **Hand 14 similarity**: In hand #14, I was in the SB with 2h 8c and folded to the same opponent's 6 chip raise. That was the correct play, and 32o is even worse than 28o.\n\nConclusion: This is an easy fold. Playing 32o out of position against an early position raise is a recipe for losing chips. The pot odds don't justify calling with such a weak hand that has terrible implied odds (even if we hit something like a pair, we could easily be dominated).\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"32o is one of the worst starting hands.

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has already folded.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see:\n1. MiniMax-M2 tends to call preflop quite often (7 calls in preflop across hands)\n2. GPT-OSS-120B has folded in the last few hands when facing raises\n3. I have 213 chips (106.5 BB), which is healthy\n4. Pocket 6s is a medium pocket pair - good for set mining but vulnerable to overcards\n\nPosition is excellent - I'm on the button. This gives me great post-flop advantage.\n\nOptions:\n- Fold: Too tight. Pocket 6s on button with no raises yet is playable.\n- Call: Standard play. See a flop cheaply and hope to hit a set or good board.\n- Raise: Could be good to take initiative. Standard raise would be 4-6 BB (8-12 chips).\n\nConsidering opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB) calls a lot preflop, so he'll likely call a raise\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB) might fold to a raise based on recent history\n\nPot odds: Calling 2 chips into pot of 3 gives me 1.5:1 odds. If I raise to say 8 chips (4x BB), I'm risking 8 to win 3, but could take it down preflop or get heads-up.\n\nTournament considerations: My stack is healthy. I can afford to play this hand. Pocket pairs lose value multi-way, so raising to isolate might be good.\n\nI think a small raise is best. It defines my hand, gives me initiative, and might get folds from the blinds. If called, I have position.\n\nI'll raise to 8 chips (4x BB)."

There are 3 players left to act: MiniMax-M2 (SB, 180 chips) and GPT-OSS-120B (BB, 226 chips). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has already folded.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see:\n1. MiniMax-M2 tends to call preflop quite often (7 calls in preflop across hands)\n2. GPT-OSS-120B has folded in the last few hands when facing raises\n3. I have 213 chips (106.5 BB), which is healthy\n4. Pocket 6s is a medium pocket pair - good for set mining but vulnerable to overcards\n\nPosition is excellent - I'm on the button. This gives me great post-flop advantage.\n\nOptions:\n- Fold: Too tight. Pocket 6s on button with no raises yet is playable.\n- Call: Standard play. See a flop cheaply and hope to hit a set or good board.\n- Raise: Could be good to take initiative. Standard raise would be 4-6 BB (8-12 chips).\n\nConsidering opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB) calls a lot preflop, so he'll likely call a raise\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB) might fold to a raise based on recent history\n\nPot odds: Calling 2 chips into pot of 3 gives me 1.5:1 odds. If I raise to say 8 chips (4x BB), I'm risking 8 to win 3, but could take it down preflop or get heads-up.\n\nTournament considerations: My stack is healthy. I can afford to play this hand. Pocket pairs lose value multi-way, so raising to isolate might be good.\n\nI think a small raise is best. It defines my hand, gives me initiative, and might get folds from the blinds. If called, I have position.\n\nI'll raise to 8 chips (4x BB).",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current hand. I'm on the button with 6c 6s. I raised preflop to 8 (4x BB). MiniMax-M2 in the small blind called. The flop is 2h 2c 4h, so it's a paired board with low cards. MiniMax-M2 checked to me.\n\nLooking at the history: MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression with pocket 5s (hand 10) where they called a flop bet and folded turn. They also called a preflop raise with TT (hand 13) but folded to a 3-bet. They've shown some bluffing tendencies with weak hands like Q8 (hand 16) where they bet turn on a Qd Kc 7c 7s board and won.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 6s on a 2-2-4 board. This is a decent spot. The board is paired with deuces, which reduces the chance opponent has a 2 (only 2 left in deck). My 6s are likely best here unless opponent has an overpair, a 4, or a pocket pair higher than 6s.\n\nPosition: I'm in position on the button, which is advantageous.\n\nPot: 18 chips. My stack: 205, opponent: 173.\n\nI should consider betting for value. Many hands that called preflop from SB could be suited connectors, small pairs, or broadway cards. A 2-2-4 flop misses most of those ranges. My 6s are ahead of most of their range.\n\nI could check back to see a turn card, but betting seems better to get value from draws (hearts), overcards, or smaller pairs. The board has a heart draw, so I should bet to charge draws.\n\nBet sizing: Pot is 18. A bet of 9-12 seems reasonable. Minimum raise is 6, but I can bet any amount above that.\n\nLet me check opponent's tendencies more. They folded TT to a 3-bet preflop. They called with 55 and folded turn. They bluffed with Q8. They seem somewhat cautious but capable of bluffing.\n\nI think a bet of 10-12 chips is good. I'll go with 12.",

          "content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nCurrent hand: I'm on the button with 6c 6s. Board is 2h 2c 4h 8c. Pot is 66 chips. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB) has bet 24 on the turn. I need to call 24. My stack is 193 chips.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see MiniMax-M2's tendencies:\n- In hand #15 (BTN vs BB), they bet 6 on turn with board 8s 8h 2d 4d, holding 2c 7d (they had bottom pair with weak kicker)\n- In hand #16 (UTG vs BB), they bet 8 on turn with board Qd Kc 7c 7s, holding Qc 8d (top pair weak kicker)\n- In hand #5 (need to see more context)\n\nLooking at this hand's history:\n- Preflop: I raised to 8 from BTN, MiniMax-M2 called from SB\n- Flop: 2h 2c 4h - they checked, I bet 12, they called\n- Turn: 8c - they now bet 24\n\nBoard analysis: The board is 2h 2c 4h 8c. My hand: 6c 6s. This gives me:\n- Pocket sixes\n- Board has two deuces (paired board)\n- No straight draws for me (need 3-5 or 5-7)\n- Backdoor flush draw with 6c (club)\n- Essentially I have an underpair to the board's pair\n\nWhat could MiniMax-M2 have?\n- They called preflop from SB, so range includes small pairs, suited connectors, broadway cards\n- They called flop bet on 2h 2c 4h board\n- Now betting turn when 8c comes\n\nPossible hands for them:\n1. A deuce (trips) - would likely check-raise flop or bet flop\n2. A four (pair of fours) - possible but weak\n3. An eight (pair of eights) - just hit on turn\n4. Flush draw with hearts (board has 2h 4h)\n5. Straight draw (3-5, 5-7)\n6. Overpair like 99+ (less likely they'd just call preflop)\n\nPot odds: I need to call 24 to win pot of 66 + 24 = 90. That's 24/90 = 26.7% equity needed.\n\nMy equity against various ranges:\n- Against trips (a deuce): I have ~4% equity (need two sixes)\n- Against pair of eights: I have ~18% equity (need to hit a six)\n- Against flush draw: I have ~70% equity (ahead)\n- Against straight draw: I have ~70% equity (ahead)\n\nMy stack: 193 chips (96.5 BB). MiniMax-M2 has 137 chips. If I call, pot will be 114, and effective stack behind will be 193-24 = 169.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack. Being cautious with marginal hands is reasonable.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's betting patterns from search:\n- They tend to bet when they hit something (hand #15 bet with bottom pair, hand #16 bet with top pair weak kicker)\n- Their bet sizes are moderate (6, 8, 24 here)\n\nThe 24 bet into 66 pot is about 36% pot - a standard value bet size.\n\nGiven the paired board and my underpair, I'm likely behind. The turn bet suggests they have at least a pair, possibly trips or an eight. My sixes are vulnerable - any overcard (9+) beats me if they have overcards.\n\nHowever, I have position and could call to see river. But implied odds are poor - if I hit a six (2 outs), I might not get paid much. Reverse implied odds are bad - if I call and they bet river, I'll have to fold.\n\nGiven pot odds of 26.7% and my likely equity being less than that against most value hands, folding seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's bluff potential. They could be betting a flush draw or straight draw. Board is 2h 2c 4h 8c - heart flush draw is possible. They might have AhXh or similar.\n\nActually, looking at hand #10: I had 5s5c and bet flop and turn, they folded on turn with 5s5c. So they can fold to aggression.\n\nBut here, they're the one betting. Given their history of betting for value with marginal hands, this looks like a value bet.\n\nI"

I need to call 24. My stack is 193 chips.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see MiniMax-M2's tendencies:\n- In hand #15 (BTN vs BB), they bet 6 on turn with board 8s 8h 2d 4d, holding 2c 7d (they had bottom pair with weak kicker)\n- In hand #16 (UTG vs BB), they bet 8 on turn with board Qd Kc 7c 7s, holding Qc 8d (top pair weak kicker)\n- In hand #5 (need to see more context)\n\nLooking at this hand's history:\n- Preflop: I raised to 8 from BTN, MiniMax-M2 called from SB\n- Flop: 2h 2c 4h - they checked, I bet 12, they called\n- Turn: 8c - they now bet 24\n\nBoard analysis: The board is 2h 2c 4h 8c. My hand: 6c 6s. This gives me:\n- Pocket sixes\n- Board has two deuces (paired board)\n- No straight draws for me (need 3-5 or 5-7)\n- Backdoor flush draw with 6c (club)\n- Essentially I have an underpair to the board's pair\n\nWhat could MiniMax-M2 have?\n- They called preflop from SB, so range includes small pairs, suited connectors, broadway cards\n- They called flop bet on 2h 2c 4h board\n- Now betting turn when 8c comes\n\nPossible hands for them:\n1. A deuce (trips) - would likely check-raise flop or bet flop\n2. A four (pair of fours) - possible but weak\n3. An eight (pair of eights) - just hit on turn\n4. Flush draw with hearts (board has 2h 4h)\n5. Straight draw (3-5, 5-7)\n6. Overpair like 99+ (less likely they'd just call preflop)\n\nPot odds: I need to call 24 to win pot of 66 + 24 = 90. That's 24/90 = 26.7% equity needed.\n\nMy equity against various ranges:\n- Against trips (a deuce): I have ~4% equity (need two sixes)\n- Against pair of eights: I have ~18% equity (need to hit a six)\n- Against flush draw: I have ~70% equity (ahead)\n- Against straight draw: I have ~70% equity (ahead)\n\nMy stack: 193 chips (96.5 BB). MiniMax-M2 has 137 chips. If I call, pot will be 114, and effective stack behind will be 193-24 = 169.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack. Being cautious with marginal hands is reasonable.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's betting patterns from search:\n- They tend to bet when they hit something (hand #15 bet with bottom pair, hand #16 bet with top pair weak kicker)\n- Their bet sizes are moderate (6, 8, 24 here)\n\nThe 24 bet into 66 pot is about 36% pot - a standard value bet size.\n\nGiven the paired board and my underpair, I'm likely behind. The turn bet suggests they have at least a pair, possibly trips or an eight. My sixes are vulnerable - any overcard (9+) beats me if they have overcards.\n\nHowever, I have position and could call to see river. But implied odds are poor - if I hit a six (2 outs), I might not get paid much. Reverse implied odds are bad - if I call and they bet river, I'll have to fold.\n\nGiven pot odds of 26.7% and my likely equity being less than that against most value hands, folding seems correct.\n\nBut let me check if there's bluff potential. They could be betting a flush draw or straight draw. Board is 2h 2c 4h 8c - heart flush draw is possible. They might have AhXh or similar.\n\nActually, looking at hand #10: I had 5s5c and bet flop and turn, they folded on turn with 5s5c. So they can fold to aggression.\n\nBut here, they're the one betting. Given their history of betting for value with marginal hands, this looks like a value bet.\n\nI",

          "reasoning_content": "Now let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with Ks9c, which is a weak hand - K9o is not a premium hand. The pot is 48 chips after the action: SB (Seat 1) posted 2, I posted 4, Seat 4 raised to 8, Seat 5 called 8, and then Seat 1 (SB) 3-bet to 28 total (raising by 20 more).\n\nI need to call 24 chips (28 total minus my 4 BB). My stack is 189 chips (47.2 BB). The pot odds: I need to call 24 to win 48+8+8+28 = 92 chips (pot of 48 + 24 call + 20 from SB's raise). Actually let me calculate: Current pot is 48 (2+4+8+8+26? Wait, Seat 1 raised to 28 total, which includes their 2 SB, so they added 26 more). Actually the pot before Seat 1's action: SB 2, BB 4, Seat 4 raise to 8, Seat 5 call 8 = 22. Then Seat 1 raises to 28 total, adding 26 more. So pot is now 22+26=48. I need to call 24 to win 48+24=72 if no one else calls. But Seat 4 and 5 still have to act after me.\n\nFrom the opponent history:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has raised preflop a couple times (hand 14 and 18 raised to 6). In hand 6 showdown had 9s8s. Seems somewhat aggressive.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has called preflop bets, showed down with weak hands like 9dTs and 4d8c.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded preflop, raised once in hand 20, showed down with 8h2h.\n\nMy hand K9o is marginal, especially facing a 3-bet. I'm out of position (BB) and will have to act first on every street. The 3-bet from the SB suggests strength - could be a wide range since it's a squeeze play against the initial raiser and caller.\n\nPot odds: 24 to call into 48 pot = 2:1 odds (33% equity needed). K9o has maybe 30-35% equity against a typical 3-bet range? But I'm also worried about the original raiser and caller behind me - they could re-raise or call, making the pot multi-way which could be good or bad for K9o.\n\nMy stack is 189 chips (47 BB). Calling 24 chips would put 12.7% of my stack in preflop. That's significant but not devastating.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm not the shortest stack (Seat 2 has 0, folded), but I'm below average. Seat 1 has 342, Seat 4 has 207, Seat 5 has 208.\n\nGiven the weak hand, out of position, facing a 3-bet, and with two players left to act behind me, folding seems prudent. K9o doesn't play well multi-way or against aggression. The pot odds are decent but implied odds are poor since I'm out of position and the board will likely miss my hand.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns from Seat 1's 3-bets. Let me search for more info.",

Position: I'm in the BB, so I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand against multiple players.\n3. Stack sizes: I have 189 chips (47 BB), which is a decent stack. Seat 1 has 342, seat 4 has 207, seat 5 has 208.\n4. The pot: Currently 48 chips (2+4+8+8+28? Wait, let me calculate: SB posted 2, I posted BB 4, seat 4 raised to 8, seat 5 called 8, seat 1 raised to 28). So pot is 2+4+8+8+28 = 50? Actually, seat 1's raise includes his SB, so total in pot: SB 2, BB 4, seat 4's 8, seat 5's 8, seat 1's additional 26 (28 total - 2 SB) = 48 chips. Yes, pot is 48.\n5. I need to call 24 to win 48, so pot odds are 2:1.\n6. Opponent tendencies: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has shown some aggression - raised to 6 in hand 18 preflop, but otherwise folded. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been calling and betting in some hands. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) just called the initial raise.\n\nWith K9o, facing a 3-bet from the small blind, I'm likely dominated. Even if I hit a pair, I could be up against better kings or better pairs. Being out of position makes it worse. The pot odds are decent (2:1), but implied odds are poor because I'm out of position and could face more betting.\n\nIn tournament poker, preserving my stack is important. K9o is a fold in this spot, especially facing a 3-bet. I should wait for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. The minimum raise to is 48, which would be a significant portion of my stack. Not worth it with this hand.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Standard 3x raise to 12 total (8 more). Minimum raise to is 8, so 12 is valid (3x BB). That's a raise of 10 more from current 2? Wait: I've already put in 2 as SB. Amount to call is 2. Minimum raise to is 8 total. So if I raise to 12 total, that means I put in 12 total, which is 10 more than my current 2. That's valid.\n\nSo action: raise, raise_to: 12. Reasoning: \"KTo suited is playable from button with position advantage. Raising to 12 chips (3x) takes initiative and may win pot preflop. Excellent pot odds and position justify aggression.\"\n\nLet me output JSON.",

I have:\n- No pair\n- Backdoor straight draw (need QJ)\n- Overcards (K, T) but Ace on board dominates King\n- Very little equity against a range that includes any Ace\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 24, I can check for free or raise. If I bet and get called/raised, I'm likely behind.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 44.2 BB, which is a decent stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear check. I have very little equity and am likely behind. Checking allows me to see a free turn card and reassess. If opponent bets, I can easily fold. If I hit a miracle King or Ten on turn, I might have some value.\n\nGiven I'm first to act with amount to call 0, \"check\" is the correct action.",

In hand #19, they called flop bet of 12, then bet 24 on turn\n2. In hand #20, they called multiple streets, then bet on turn\n3. In hand #21, they raised preflop (8 then 48), then bet 40 on flop, 40 on turn\n4. Showdown hands show they played 9d Ts and 4d 8c\n\n**Current Situation:**\nI raised preflop from BTN to 12, opponent called from BB. Flop came Ad 9h 2d. I checked, opponent bet 12 into 36 pot (1/3 pot bet).\n\n**My Hand Strength:**\n- I have middle pair with Ten (pair of 9s on board)\n- Backdoor straight draw (QJ would give me straight)\n- Backdoor flush draw (if diamonds come)\n- King kicker might be good if opponent has weaker pair\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 36, bet is 12, so total pot would be 48 if I call\n- I need 12 to win 48, giving me 25% pot odds\n- I have roughly 5 outs (two tens, three kings) = ~20% equity\n- Plus backdoor straight and flush draws add maybe 4-5% more\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 177 chips (44.2 BB), opponent has 291 chips\n- This is a small bet (1/3 pot), could be a probe bet with weak hand\n- Opponent in BB could have called with wide range\n\n**Decision:**\nThe pot odds (25%) are close to my estimated equity (~24-25% with draws). However, I have position and can see turn card. The small bet size suggests weakness - could be testing or betting with weaker pair. Given my position and the small bet size, I should call to see turn.\n\nIf I hit a King or Ten on turn, I could take the pot. If I miss, I can reevaluate. Folding seems too tight given the small bet and my position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Calling small 1/3 pot bet with middle pair and backdoor draws.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current hand. I'm on the turn with Ks Th, board is Ad 9h 2d Ts. I have middle pair with Ten kicker. I raised preflop from BTN, MiniMax-M2 called from BB. I checked flop, they bet 12 into 24, I called. Now on turn, amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's tendencies from the search results:\n- They tend to bet on turns when they have initiative (hands 15, 16, 19, 20, 21)\n- In hand 19, they bet turn after calling flop bet with 66 on 22h2c4h board\n- In hand 20, they bet turn after calling flop bet with K4 on 5s6s9d board\n- They seem to be aggressive post-flop, especially on turns\n\nMy hand: I have middle pair (Tens) with King kicker. Board has Ad 9h 2d Ts. I have second pair. There's a flush draw (diamonds) and straight draws possible (KQ, QJ, J8). My kicker is decent (King).\n\nPot is 48 chips. My stack is 165. MiniMax-M2 has 291. If I check, they might bet again. If they bet small, I might have to call given pot odds. But my hand is vulnerable - any King, Queen, Jack, or diamond could beat me or improve draws.\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2's aggressive tendencies on turns, checking might invite a bet that puts me in a tough spot. However, raising could be risky since they called my preflop raise and bet flop - they likely have at least something like a weak Ace, a pair, or a draw.\n\nI should check to see what they do. If they check back, I get a free river. If they bet small, I can call with my pair. If they bet big, I might need to fold.\n\nActually, looking at hand 19: I had 66, raised preflop, bet flop, they called, then they bet turn and I folded. Similar situation - I had an underpair to the board. Now I have middle pair. But they showed aggression on turn in that hand too.\n\nI think checking is best here. My hand is marginal - not strong enough to value bet, not weak enough to fold. Checking allows me to control the pot size and see what they do.\n\nWait, I have position (BTN) and it's checked to me. Actually no, I'm first to act on the turn because I called flop bet. So I'm first to act. I should check.\n\nLet me check the action sequence: I'm Seat 3 (BTN). On flop, I checked, they bet, I called. Now on turn, I act first. So I should check.\n\nIf I check and they bet, I'll have to decide. But for now, check.",

The board shows Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h - so there's an ace, nine, two, ten, two. The turn was a ten, giving me a pair of tens. The river brought a 2h, making the board Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h. So now there's a pair of twos on board.\n\nPot is 48 chips. My stack is 165 chips. Opponent (Seat 4: MiniMax-M2) has 291 chips. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nI need to think about hand strength: I have Ks Th, board is Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h. My hand: pair of tens with king kicker. The board has Ad (ace), so opponent could have an ace. Also possible flush draws missed (diamonds didn't come), but there's no flush possible since only two diamonds. Straight draws: nothing really connects except maybe QJ for straight, but board has Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h, so straight would need KQJ or something, but that's unlikely.\n\nThe river paired the twos, making board Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h. So now there are two pair on board: twos and tens? Actually board has two twos and one ten. So my hand is tens with king kicker, but board has pair of twos which could give someone a full house if they have a two. But a two is unlikely since I raised preflop and opponent called.\n\nLet me think about preflop action: I raised from SB to 12 (3x BB), opponent in BB called. So my range as SB raiser could be wide. Opponent's calling range from BB could also be wide.\n\nFlop: Ad 9h 2d. I checked, opponent bet 12 into pot of 24? Let's calculate: preflop pot was my 12 + opponent's 12 = 24, plus blinds 2+4 = 6? Wait, SB posted 2, BB posted 4, I raised to 12 total (so additional 10), opponent called additional 8. So pot preflop: SB 2 + BB 4 + my raise 12 + opponent call 8 = 26? Actually let's recalc: I'm seat 3 (SB). I posted SB 2, then raised to 12 total. That means I put in additional 10. Opponent (BB) posted BB 4, then called my raise of 12, meaning he put in additional 8. So total pot preflop: 2 (my SB) + 4 (BB) + 10 (my additional) + 8 (opponent additional) = 24. Yes.\n\nFlop: I check, opponent bets 12 into 24, half pot. I call with my pair of tens (ten on turn? Wait, turn was the Ts. Actually flop was Ad 9h 2d. I called with gutshot? I have Ks Th, so on flop Ad 9h 2d, I have backdoor straight draw, backdoor flush draw (hearts?), but my Th is hearts? Actually my Th is ten of hearts. So I have one heart. Board has 9h (heart), 2h (heart on river). So backdoor flush draw possible. But mostly I called with overcard and backdoors.\n\nTurn: Ts. Board now Ad 9h 2d Ts. I check, opponent checks. So opponent didn't continue betting on turn after I called flop. That suggests weakness. Maybe opponent had a draw or weak ace.\n\nRiver: 2h. Board now Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h. I have Ks Th, so pair of tens with king kicker. Board has pair of twos. So my hand is essentially two pair: tens and twos, but the twos are on board, so anyone with a ten has same two pair. Anyone with an ace has two pair aces and twos. Anyone with a two has full house.\n\nGiven opponent checked turn, they likely don't have a strong hand. Could be a weak ace like A8, A7, maybe a draw that missed. Could also have a nine or pocket pair like 88, 77.\n\nI need to decide whether to bet for value or check. I have second pair, but might be best hand. Pot is 48 chips. I could bet small for value, maybe 1/3 pot (16 chips) or half pot (24). Or check"

          "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this situation. I'm on the river with Ks Th, board is Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h. I have a pair of tens with king kicker. The board shows Ad 9h 2d Ts 2h, so there's an ace, nine, two of diamonds, ten of spades, and two of hearts. The river paired the twos.\n\nLooking at the action: preflop I raised from SB to 12, opponent called. Flop Ad 9h 2d: I checked, opponent bet 12 (half pot), I called. Turn Ts: I checked, opponent checked. River 2h: now action to me.\n\nOpponent's flop bet could be a continuation bet with any two cards, or value with an ace. But then they checked turn when the ten came. The ten is a scare card because it completes some straight draws (QJ would have straight), but more importantly, it gives me a pair if I was floating. So opponent's check on turn suggests weakness - likely doesn't have a strong ace, maybe a weak ace or a draw.\n\nNow river brings a 2h, pairing the board. This is a brick for most draws. Diamonds didn't come for flush, straight draws missed. So opponent likely has a weak hand.\n\nMy hand is medium strength - pair of tens with king kicker. I beat all bluffs, weak aces with worse kicker (like A8, A7, A6, A5, A4, A3), any pair lower than tens, and any missed draws. I lose to any ace with better kicker (AJ, AQ, AK), any two pair (A9, A2, 92), any set (99, 22, AA), and any full house (22, TT, 99, AA).\n\nGiven opponent's turn check, they're unlikely to have a strong hand. They might call a small value bet with a weak ace or middle pair. I should bet for value. Pot is 48 chips. A bet of 16-24 chips (1/3 to 1/2 pot) seems reasonable. If I bet and get raised, I can fold.\n\nMy stack is 165 chips (41 BB), opponent has 291. Tournament considerations: I'm below average stack (average would be around 200-250? 5 players, total chips ~946, average ~189). So I'm slightly below average. Building chips is important.\n\nI should bet for thin value. Let's say 1/3 pot = 16 chips. Or 1/2 pot = 24 chips. I'll go with 20 chips (a bit less than half pot).\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. I want to raise (bet) since amount to call is 0. Minimum raise to is 12, but I can bet any amount above that. I'll bet 20.\n\nReasoning: Opponent showed weakness by checking turn, likely has weak ace or middle pair that will call small bet. My pair of tens with king kicker has good showdown value but can extract value from weaker hands. Betting also protects against opponent bluffing river if I check.\n\nJSON response.",

Actually it's Kh 4s, so not suited. This is a very marginal hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position. However, with only 2 players left to act (SB and BB), and the SB (MiniMax-M2) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B) are yet to act.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 213 chips (53.2 BB), which is healthy. MiniMax-M2 has 289 chips (72.25 BB), GPT-OSS-120B has 204 chips (51 BB).\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB): From the data, seems to be active. In hand #21, they made a preflop raise to 8, then re-raised to 48. In hand #22, they called a raise preflop. Seems capable of aggressive play.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has folded several hands preflop (hands 17-19, 22). Only raised once (hand #20 from BB position with just 4 chips which was actually just completing?). Actually looking at hand #20: they raised to 4 from BB when facing no raise? That might have been just checking? Actually \"raise\" to 4 from BB when BB is already 4 suggests they just checked. They seem relatively tight.\n\n5. **Current situation**: Everyone has folded to me on the Button. I can open-raise, call the BB, or fold.\n\n6. **Hand analysis**: Kh4o is a weak hand. Generally not recommended to open with this from any position, but being on the Button against just SB and BB, it's borderline. The problem is that if I raise, I'm likely to get called or re-raised by SB who seems aggressive. If I just call (limp), that's generally bad poker strategy as it invites the blinds to see a cheap flop with any two cards.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: I have 53 BB, which is a decent stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands.\n\n8. **Alternative considerations**: Some aggressive players might open-raise with any two cards on the Button, but Kh4o is particularly weak because it has poor playability postflop. The king is good but the 4 kicker is terrible.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best play is to **fold**. The hand is too weak to open-raise, and limping is bad strategy. I should wait for a better spot, especially since I have a healthy stack.\n\nLet me check if there are any other relevant observations about button opens."

UTG is the earliest position, meaning I have to act first preflop with 5 players still to act behind me (SB, BB, and 2 others). With 53.2 BB stack, I'm not desperate for chips.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot (16 folds out of 23 hands), which is reasonable. I won hand #22 with Ks Th from SB position, but that's a much better hand than 4c Td.\n\nThe opponents: MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 has shown aggressive tendencies with raises preflop (hand #21, #23). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is in BB, seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is SB.\n\nWith 4c Td offsuit, this is a trash hand that should almost always be folded from UTG. There's very little potential to make a strong hand postflop. Even if I hit a pair, it's likely dominated. The hand has poor connectivity and no suitedness.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 4 chips into pot of 6 (total pot would be 10 if I call). That's 2.5:1 odds, but with such a weak hand and poor position, the implied odds are terrible.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 53.2 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands from early position.\n\nGiven that I'm first to act, if I call, I'll likely face raises from later positions (especially MiniMax-M2 who has been aggressive). Better to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"4c Td is a very weak hand from UTG position with 5 players left to act. Poor hand strength, terrible position, and aggressive opponents behind make this an easy fold. With 53.2 BB stack, better to preserve chips for stronger spots.\"\n}",

We have 209 chips (52.2 BB), so we're reasonably deep.\n\nThe action: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8 (2BB), then Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) 3-bet to 24 (6BB). We need to call 20 chips to continue.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been folding a lot recently (folds in last 4 hands). This 3-bet after a raise suggests a strong hand, possibly premium.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been raising frequently (raises in hands 21, 23, 24) and showed aggression. In hand 21, they made a big 4-bet preflop (from 8 to 48), showing they're willing to play aggressively.\n\nThe pot is currently 38 chips (our 4 BB + 2 SB + 8 raise + 24 3-bet). We need to call 20 to win 58 (38 + our 20 call). That's about 2.9:1 pot odds.\n\nHowever, K4o is a terrible hand to call a 3-bet with, especially out of position. We'll be in the small blind, which means we'll act first on every street postflop. This is a huge disadvantage.\n\nAdditionally, Seat 4 still has to act after us. They could 4-bet, which would put us in an even worse spot. Even if they just call, we'll be facing a 3-way pot with a weak hand out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: We have 52 BB, which is healthy. No need to gamble with K4o against what looks like strong ranges.\n\nMy analysis:\n1. Hand strength: Very weak - K4o has poor playability, low equity against 3-bet ranges\n2. Position: Terrible (SB, out of position)\n3. Opponent tendencies: Both showing strength\n4. Pot odds: Decent (2.9:1) but not enough given hand weakness and positional disadvantage\n5. Tournament: Preserving stack is important\n\nThis is an easy fold. We should wait for better spots."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nWe're in the small blind with Ks 4c, which is a weak hand - King-rag offsuit. We have 209 chips (52.2 BB), so we're reasonably deep.\n\nThe action: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8 (2BB), then Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) 3-bet to 24 (6BB). We need to call 20 chips to continue.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been folding a lot recently (folds in last 4 hands). This 3-bet after a raise suggests a strong hand, possibly premium.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been raising frequently (raises in hands 21, 23, 24) and showed aggression. In hand 21, they made a big 4-bet preflop (from 8 to 48), showing they're willing to play aggressively.\n\nThe pot is currently 38 chips (our 4 BB + 2 SB + 8 raise + 24 3-bet). We need to call 20 to win 58 (38 + our 20 call). That's about 2.9:1 pot odds.\n\nHowever, K4o is a terrible hand to call a 3-bet with, especially out of position. We'll be in the small blind, which means we'll act first on every street postflop. This is a huge disadvantage.\n\nAdditionally, Seat 4 still has to act after us. They could 4-bet, which would put us in an even worse spot. Even if they just call, we'll be facing a 3-way pot with a weak hand out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: We have 52 BB, which is healthy. No need to gamble with K4o against what looks like strong ranges.\n\nMy analysis:\n1. Hand strength: Very weak - K4o has poor playability, low equity against 3-bet ranges\n2. Position: Terrible (SB, out of position)\n3. Opponent tendencies: Both showing strength\n4. Pot odds: Decent (2.9:1) but not enough given hand weakness and positional disadvantage\n5. Tournament: Preserving stack is important\n\nThis is an easy fold. We should wait for better spots.",

I have to call 2 chips to complete the small blind, with the big blind already posted. The pot is 6 chips (2 from my SB, 4 from BB).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been raising preflop frequently - they raised in hands 23, 24, and 25. In hand 25, they raised to 8 then called a re-raise to 16. They seem aggressive preflop.\n\nHowever, I have position on them (I'm BTN, they're in SB next hand). But my hand is just so weak. 36o has almost no playability postflop. Even with position, this hand will rarely hit a flop well, and when it does, it's usually weak pairs or weak draws.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 to win 6, so I'm getting 3:1 odds. That's decent, but implied odds are poor because when I do hit something like a pair of 3s or 6s, it's vulnerable and won't win big pots. Reverse implied odds are bad - I could hit a pair and lose to better pairs.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take marginal spots with trash hands. Folding costs me only 2 chips (my SB), which is negligible.\n\nMy position is good (button), but the hand is just too weak to play. Even if I complete and see a flop, I'll often have to fold to any aggression.\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 has been raising frequently, if I call, they might raise behind me, putting me in a tough spot.\n\nBetter to just fold this trash hand and wait for a better spot.

I have pocket aces.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is a great position to play from, especially with a strong hand.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. Opponents have similar stacks (253 and 252 chips).\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown aggressive preflop tendencies, raising to 8 chips in hands 23, 24, and 25. In hand 25, they called a re-raise to 16. They seem somewhat loose-aggressive.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded preflop (hands 21-24, 26), but made a big raise to 24 in hand 25. They showed Ad Ts in hand 25, so they can play speculative hands.\n\n5. **Current situation**: I'm on the button with 4 chips to call. There's 6 chips in the pot (SB + BB). Seat 1 folded, so it's just me to act against SB (Seat 4) and BB (Seat 5).\n\nWith pocket aces, I definitely want to build the pot. The standard play would be to raise. Since I'm on the button and both blinds are still in, I should make a substantial raise to isolate and build the pot.\n\nLooking at the minimum raise to: 8, which is just a min-raise. That's probably too small. I should raise to something like 12-16 chips to build a pot and discourage speculative calls.\n\nGiven that Seat 4 has been raising to 8 preflop, and Seat 5 raised to 24 in one hand, I think a raise to 16-20 would be appropriate. This builds the pot while still allowing me to potentially get action.\n\nI'll raise to 16 chips (4x the BB). This is a strong but not overly aggressive raise that should get respect and potentially get calls from the blinds.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 16,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket aces on the button - premium hand that should be raised aggressively.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI have Ad Ah (pocket aces) on the BTN with 191 chips (47.8 BB). I raised to 16 (4x BB). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) in the SB 3-bet to 28 total (7x BB). BB folded.\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: I see from hand #21 they raised to 8, then re-raised to 48 (a massive 4-bet). From hands #23-25, they raised to 8 (standard 2x BB raise) multiple times. In hand #25, they called a 3-bet with Jh Kh.\n\nNow I need to decide: fold, call 12 more, or raise. With pocket aces, I should definitely not fold. Calling is an option, but raising is better to build the pot and get value. The pot is currently 48 (my 16 + their 28 + blinds 4). I need to call 12 more to make it 40 total.\n\nIf I raise, minimum raise to 40 total. That would be raising 24 more (from my current 16 to 40). Or I could raise more.\n\nMy stack is 191, opponent has 227. This is a tournament situation. With pocket aces, I want to get as many chips in preflop as possible. The opponent has shown aggression with re-raises (hand #21 they 4-bet to 48). They might have a strong hand but not necessarily as strong as AA.\n\nI should 4-bet. Let me calculate: if I raise to say 60-80, that would be a significant portion of my stack. Actually, let me think: minimum raise to 40 is small - only 24 more from my 16. That seems too small. I could raise to 80-100, which would be committing a good portion of my stack.\n\nGiven tournament dynamics and my premium hand, I should make a substantial 4-bet. Let's say raise to 80 total (putting in 64 more). That's a 4-bet to 20x BB. If they 5-bet shove, I'm calling with AA.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: I have 191, opponent has 227. If I raise to 80, I'd have 111 left behind. The pot would be 80 + 28 + 4 = 112. So I'd have roughly pot-sized bet left. That sets up a potential shove on flop.\n\nBetter to raise larger to commit more chips preflop. Maybe raise to 100? That would leave me 91 behind. Actually, with AA, I could even consider shoving all-in preflop given stack sizes (191 total, 47.8 BB). But that might scare them off.\n\nLet me check if they've shown willingness to call big bets preflop. In hand #21, they 4-bet to 48 (12x BB). In hand #25, they called a 3-bet with Jh Kh.\n\nI think a raise to 80-100 is good. Let's go with 100 total (raising 84 more from my current 16). That's a strong 4-bet.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 100,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket aces premium hand. Opponent has shown aggression with re-raises (hand #21 4-bet to 48). Making a strong 4-bet to 100 (25x BB) to build pot and commit chips with best hand. Sets up potential shove on flop with remaining 91 chips. Tournament chip accumulation opportunity with AA.\"\n}",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My hand: Ts 5s (suited Ten-Five) - this is a very weak hand, especially from UTG (early position)\n- Position: UTG (worst position, have to act first postflop)\n- Stack: 239 chips (59.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the search results, I can see:\n1. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has been quite aggressive preflop, raising frequently (Hands 21, 23, 24, 25, 27)\n2. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) is in SB, will act after me\n3. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) is in BB, will act last preflop\n\n**Positional Considerations:**\n- I'm UTG, so I have 4 players left to act after me (SB, BB, and two others)\n- With such a weak hand, opening from UTG is very risky\n- If I limp (call), I invite others to raise behind me\n- If I raise, I'm bloating the pot with a weak hand out of position\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 59.8 BB, which is a good stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands\n- Ts5s has some speculative value (suited, can make flushes), but not enough to play from UTG\n\n**Previous UTG Plays:**\nLooking at my UTG history, I've folded every time from UTG so far (hands 8, 12, 16, 20, 24). This is generally correct strategy - play tight from early position.\n\n**Decision:**\n- Ts5s is well below UTG opening range\n- Even suited, it's still a weak hand\n- Position is terrible\n- Likely to face raises from aggressive players behind me (especially MiniMax-M2)\n- Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots\n\n**Conclusion:** Fold is the correct play. I should wait for a better hand in better position.",

Could be a steal attempt from SB.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 8 to win 16, so I'm getting 2:1 odds (33% equity needed).\n\n**Hand Strength:** K7s is a marginal hand. Suited King with a 7 kicker is not great, but suited gives some flush potential. Against a likely stealing range from SB, K7s has some value.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I have 58.8 BB, which is a healthy stack. Don't need to take big risks.\n\n**Decision:** With position and decent pot odds, calling seems reasonable. Folding is too tight against a likely steal. Raising seems aggressive with a marginal hand.

          "content": "Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with Kd7d. Preflop: SB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 12, I called 8 more (total 4 was already posted as BB). Pot was 42 (2+4+12+8+?). Actually let me calculate: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, SB raised 12 total (so additional 10), I called 8 more. That's 2+4+12+8 = 26. Wait, pot is 42 chips now. Maybe there's something else.\n\nFlop: 4c5d6s. This is a great flop for my hand! I have a flush draw (diamonds) and a straight draw. Actually, with Kd7d on 4c5d6s:\n- I have a gutshot straight draw to an 8 (would give me 4-5-6-7-8 straight)\n- I have a flush draw (backdoor flush draw? Wait, I have Kd7d, flop has 5d, so I have a flush draw with 2 diamonds in hand and 1 on board)\n- I have overcard potential with King high\n- I have backdoor straight potential\n\nThe board is 4-5-6 rainbow? Actually 4c5d6s - two different suits, diamond is one of them.\n\nOpponent bet 18 into 42 pot (about 43% pot bet). I need to call 18 to win pot of 42+18=60. That's pot odds of 18:60 or 30%. I need at least 30% equity to call.\n\nLet me estimate my equity against a typical SB raising range. SB raised preflop from small blind. My opponent \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\" has been folding a lot preflop (from the data: folded 6 of last 7 hands preflop). But this hand they raised preflop. So they likely have a stronger than average hand.\n\nMy hand has good equity against many hands: \n- Against overpairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT): I have flush draw + straight draw ~35-40% equity\n- Against top pair hands (like A4, A5, A6): similar equity\n- Against sets (44, 55, 66): I have ~25-30% equity\n- Against two pair (45, 46, 56): I have ~30-35% equity\n- Against straight draws (like 78): I'm behind but have flush redraw\n\nOverall I likely have 30-40% equity, which makes calling profitable given 30% pot odds.\n\nBut I should also consider raising. Raising could:\n1. Fold out some weaker hands\n2. Build pot for when I hit\n3. Take initiative\n\nHowever, raising with a draw might be risky since I'm out of position. Also, my stack is 227, pot is 42, bet is 18. If I raise to say 54 (minimum raise to 36 total? Wait, minimum raise to is 36, meaning I need to raise to at least 36 total. Actually opponent bet 18, so minimum raise is to 36 total (additional 18). But I could raise more.\n\nBut I'm deep stacked (56.8 BB) and opponent is also deep. Raising might commit me if opponent re-raises.\n\nGiven I'm out of position, calling might be better to see a turn card. Also, if I hit my draw on turn, I can potentially win a big pot.\n\nLet me check if opponent tends to continuation bet often. From the data, I only see one flop action from opponent (hand 21: check on flop). Not much data.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have average stack (227 vs blinds 2/4). No need to take huge risks.\n\nI think calling is reasonable. I have good equity, good pot odds, and position disadvantage. If turn bricks, I can re-evaluate.\n\nWait, I should also consider that I have position? Actually I'm BB, opponent is SB. After flop, action goes to me first? No, SB acted first on flop (bet 18). So I'm last to act on flop. That's good - I have position for the rest of the hand.\n\nActually let me check: SB is seat 1, I'm BB seat 3. After flop, SB bet first, now it's on me. So I have position for turn and river.\n\nThat makes calling even better - I have position advantage.\n\nI'll call."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with Kd7d. Preflop: SB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 12, I called 8 more (total 4 was already posted as BB). Pot was 42 (2+4+12+8+?). Actually let me calculate: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, SB raised 12 total (so additional 10), I called 8 more. That's 2+4+12+8 = 26. Wait, pot is 42 chips now. Maybe there's something else.\n\nFlop: 4c5d6s. This is a great flop for my hand! I have a flush draw (diamonds) and a straight draw. Actually, with Kd7d on 4c5d6s:\n- I have a gutshot straight draw to an 8 (would give me 4-5-6-7-8 straight)\n- I have a flush draw (backdoor flush draw? Wait, I have Kd7d, flop has 5d, so I have a flush draw with 2 diamonds in hand and 1 on board)\n- I have overcard potential with King high\n- I have backdoor straight potential\n\nThe board is 4-5-6 rainbow? Actually 4c5d6s - two different suits, diamond is one of them.\n\nOpponent bet 18 into 42 pot (about 43% pot bet). I need to call 18 to win pot of 42+18=60. That's pot odds of 18:60 or 30%. I need at least 30% equity to call.\n\nLet me estimate my equity against a typical SB raising range. SB raised preflop from small blind. My opponent \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\" has been folding a lot preflop (from the data: folded 6 of last 7 hands preflop). But this hand they raised preflop. So they likely have a stronger than average hand.\n\nMy hand has good equity against many hands: \n- Against overpairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT): I have flush draw + straight draw ~35-40% equity\n- Against top pair hands (like A4, A5, A6): similar equity\n- Against sets (44, 55, 66): I have ~25-30% equity\n- Against two pair (45, 46, 56): I have ~30-35% equity\n- Against straight draws (like 78): I'm behind but have flush redraw\n\nOverall I likely have 30-40% equity, which makes calling profitable given 30% pot odds.\n\nBut I should also consider raising. Raising could:\n1. Fold out some weaker hands\n2. Build pot for when I hit\n3. Take initiative\n\nHowever, raising with a draw might be risky since I'm out of position. Also, my stack is 227, pot is 42, bet is 18. If I raise to say 54 (minimum raise to 36 total? Wait, minimum raise to is 36, meaning I need to raise to at least 36 total. Actually opponent bet 18, so minimum raise is to 36 total (additional 18). But I could raise more.\n\nBut I'm deep stacked (56.8 BB) and opponent is also deep. Raising might commit me if opponent re-raises.\n\nGiven I'm out of position, calling might be better to see a turn card. Also, if I hit my draw on turn, I can potentially win a big pot.\n\nLet me check if opponent tends to continuation bet often. From the data, I only see one flop action from opponent (hand 21: check on flop). Not much data.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have average stack (227 vs blinds 2/4). No need to take huge risks.\n\nI think calling is reasonable. I have good equity, good pot odds, and position disadvantage. If turn bricks, I can re-evaluate.\n\nWait, I should also consider that I have position? Actually I'm BB, opponent is SB. After flop, action goes to me first? No, SB acted first on flop (bet 18). So I'm last to act on flop. That's good - I have position for the rest of the hand.\n\nActually let me check: SB is seat 1, I'm BB seat 3. After flop, SB bet first, now it's on me. So I have position for turn and river.\n\nThat makes calling even better - I have position advantage.\n\nI'll call.",

This could mean:\n1. They missed the flop and are giving up\n2. They have a weak hand and are checking to control pot\n3. They're setting up a check-raise (but I haven't seen this pattern from them)\n4. They have a draw and want a free card\n\nMy hand has improved to a pair of 7s. The board is draw-heavy with straight and flush possibilities. My King kicker is decent but not great.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card, see river, keep pot small\n2. **Bet**: Try to take down the pot now, charge draws\n\n**Considerations:**\n- I'm out of position, which makes playing the river tricky\n- The pot is 60 chips, I have 209 behind\n- If I bet and get called or raised, I'll be in a tough spot on river\n- My hand is vulnerable to many rivers (any 8, 3, spade, higher card)\n\nGiven the opponent's check and my positional disadvantage, I think checking is reasonable. I can re-evaluate on the river. If the opponent bets river, I'll need to decide if my pair of 7s is good.\n\nI'll check and see what happens on the river."

This could mean:\n1. They missed the flop and are giving up\n2. They have a weak hand and are checking to control pot\n3. They're setting up a check-raise (but I haven't seen this pattern from them)\n4. They have a draw and want a free card\n\nMy hand has improved to a pair of 7s. The board is draw-heavy with straight and flush possibilities. My King kicker is decent but not great.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card, see river, keep pot small\n2. **Bet**: Try to take down the pot now, charge draws\n\n**Considerations:**\n- I'm out of position, which makes playing the river tricky\n- The pot is 60 chips, I have 209 behind\n- If I bet and get called or raised, I'll be in a tough spot on river\n- My hand is vulnerable to many rivers (any 8, 3, spade, higher card)\n\nGiven the opponent's check and my positional disadvantage, I think checking is reasonable. I can re-evaluate on the river. If the opponent bets river, I'll need to decide if my pair of 7s is good.\n\nI'll check and see what happens on the river.",

My hand is marginal (middle pair on wet board)\n2. Opponent showed weakness by checking river\n3. Pot is relatively small (60 chips)\n4. I could be beaten by many hands (any J, 8, 9, T, flush, straight)\n5. Checking allows me to see showdown without risking more chips\n\nI think checking is the prudent play. If I bet and get raised, I'd likely have to fold. A bet might get called by better hands and fold out worse hands. Checking allows me to potentially win if opponent has missed draws.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Middle pair on wet board with many better hands possible.

I have to call 10 more to a pot of 18.\n\n**Hand strength:** 64s is a speculative hand. Suited connectors can play well multiway but I'm heads-up against a raiser. This is a weak hand preflop.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), opponent has 238 chips. We're both deep stacked.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** From the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop in 3 hands: \n- Hand 13: raised to 30 (7.5x BB)\n- Hand 20: raised to 4 (just the BB - likely a misclick or special situation)\n- Hand 25: raised to 24 (6x BB)\n\nLooks like they raise aggressively preflop, often with large sizing (6-7.5x BB). The current raise is 12 (3x BB), which is smaller than their typical raises.\n\n**Position:** Being on the BTN is advantageous, but I'm out of position against the raiser who is in MP/CO? Actually, Seat 5 is likely UTG+1 or MP? Let me check: Seat 1 folded (UTG), I'm BTN (Seat 3), Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB? Wait no - looking at actions: Seat 3 (me) posted SB 2, Seat 4 posted BB 4, Seat 5 raised 12. So Seat 5 is UTG? Actually if I'm BTN, then Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB. But the action says Seat 5 raised after posting BB? That doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 2\" (me), \"preflop: Seat 4 post_bb 4\", \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 12\". So Seat 5 is UTG (first to act after blinds). So they're raising from UTG position.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 18 (2+4+12), I need to call 10. That's 1.8:1 pot odds, or needing ~35.7% equity. 64s vs a UTG raising range has maybe 30-35% equity at best. Not great.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 51.8 BB, which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots with weak hands.\n\n**My history:** From my hands, I've been aggressive on BTN with good hands (KK, AA, KTs). I folded weak hands like 27o, K4o. 64s is borderline but probably too weak against a UTG raise.\n\n**Decision:** I should fold. While suited connectors can be playable, facing a UTG raise from a player who seems to raise aggressively, and being out of position postflop (they act after me on flop/turn/river since they're UTG and I'm BTN? Actually no - if they're UTG and I'm BTN, I have position on them. Wait, position order: UTG (Seat 5) acts first, then folds, then me (BTN), then SB, then BB. Actually if Seat 5 is UTG, they act first preflop, but postflop the action goes: SB, BB, UTG, BTN? Let me think: Blinds are Seat 3 (SB) and Seat 4 (BB). Seat 5 is UTG. Postflop, action starts with SB (Seat 3 - me), then BB (Seat 4), then UTG (Seat 5). So I would be out of position against the raiser! They act after me. That's bad.\n\nActually no, I'm confused. Let me reconstruct: Seat numbers: 1, 2, 3(me), 4, 5. I'm Seat 3 (BTN). Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB. But the action says Seat 5 raised after posting BB? That can't be right. Unless the hand is mislabeled? Actually \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 12\" - if Seat 5 is BB, they would have already posted 4. Raising to 12 means putting 8 more. That makes sense. So Seat 5 is BB raising after posting blind. So they're in BB position, not UTG.\n\nSo position: BB raised, I'm BTN. I have position on the raiser! That's good. But still, facing a"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation:\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN with 4h6h. The action: UTG (Seat 1) folded, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 12 total (3x BB). I have to call 10 more to a pot of 18.\n\n**Hand strength:** 64s is a speculative hand. Suited connectors can play well multiway but I'm heads-up against a raiser. This is a weak hand preflop.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), opponent has 238 chips. We're both deep stacked.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** From the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop in 3 hands: \n- Hand 13: raised to 30 (7.5x BB)\n- Hand 20: raised to 4 (just the BB - likely a misclick or special situation)\n- Hand 25: raised to 24 (6x BB)\n\nLooks like they raise aggressively preflop, often with large sizing (6-7.5x BB). The current raise is 12 (3x BB), which is smaller than their typical raises.\n\n**Position:** Being on the BTN is advantageous, but I'm out of position against the raiser who is in MP/CO? Actually, Seat 5 is likely UTG+1 or MP? Let me check: Seat 1 folded (UTG), I'm BTN (Seat 3), Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB? Wait no - looking at actions: Seat 3 (me) posted SB 2, Seat 4 posted BB 4, Seat 5 raised 12. So Seat 5 is UTG? Actually if I'm BTN, then Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB. But the action says Seat 5 raised after posting BB? That doesn't make sense. Let me re-read: \"preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 2\" (me), \"preflop: Seat 4 post_bb 4\", \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 12\". So Seat 5 is UTG (first to act after blinds). So they're raising from UTG position.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 18 (2+4+12), I need to call 10. That's 1.8:1 pot odds, or needing ~35.7% equity. 64s vs a UTG raising range has maybe 30-35% equity at best. Not great.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 51.8 BB, which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots with weak hands.\n\n**My history:** From my hands, I've been aggressive on BTN with good hands (KK, AA, KTs). I folded weak hands like 27o, K4o. 64s is borderline but probably too weak against a UTG raise.\n\n**Decision:** I should fold. While suited connectors can be playable, facing a UTG raise from a player who seems to raise aggressively, and being out of position postflop (they act after me on flop/turn/river since they're UTG and I'm BTN? Actually no - if they're UTG and I'm BTN, I have position on them. Wait, position order: UTG (Seat 5) acts first, then folds, then me (BTN), then SB, then BB. Actually if Seat 5 is UTG, they act first preflop, but postflop the action goes: SB, BB, UTG, BTN? Let me think: Blinds are Seat 3 (SB) and Seat 4 (BB). Seat 5 is UTG. Postflop, action starts with SB (Seat 3 - me), then BB (Seat 4), then UTG (Seat 5). So I would be out of position against the raiser! They act after me. That's bad.\n\nActually no, I'm confused. Let me reconstruct: Seat numbers: 1, 2, 3(me), 4, 5. I'm Seat 3 (BTN). Seat 4 is SB, Seat 5 is BB. But the action says Seat 5 raised after posting BB? That can't be right. Unless the hand is mislabeled? Actually \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 12\" - if Seat 5 is BB, they would have already posted 4. Raising to 12 means putting 8 more. That makes sense. So Seat 5 is BB raising after posting blind. So they're in BB position, not UTG.\n\nSo position: BB raised, I'm BTN. I have position on the raiser! That's good. But still, facing a",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation properly. I'm on the BTN with 4h6h. The BB (Seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 12 total (3x BB). I need to call 10 more.\n\nFrom the opponent actions, GPT-OSS-120B has raised twice:\n- Hand 20: raised to 4 (just the BB amount, which seems like a misclick or special situation)\n- Hand 25: raised to 24 (6x BB)\n\nSo they've shown some aggression but not excessive. The current raise of 12 (3x BB) is more standard.\n\nMy hand: 64s is a speculative hand. As suited connectors, they play well in position with deep stacks. I have position on the raiser (I'm BTN, they're BB, so I act after them postflop). That's a big advantage.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 18, I need to call 10. That's 1.8:1, needing ~35.7% equity. Against a typical BB raising range (which might be wider since they're defending their blind), 64s likely has around 35-40% equity. So pot odds are borderline.\n\nStack sizes: I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), opponent has 238. We're both deep, which makes speculative hands more playable.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, no need to take big risks. But playing suited connectors in position with deep stacks can be profitable.\n\nMy own history: I've been folding weak hands, playing aggressively with premiums. I should be selective but not too tight.\n\nThe BB raised, which could be a steal attempt. They might have a wider range. Being in position with a suited connector is reasonable.\n\nHowever, 64s is one of the weakest suited connectors. The gap between 4 and 6 is small, but it's still low cards. I could consider calling to see a flop and potentially win a big pot if I hit a strong draw or two pair. But I need to be prepared to fold if I miss.\n\nLet me check if there are any other players left to act: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is SB and hasn't acted yet. They still need to act after me. So there's risk of a squeeze.\n\nActually, wait: The action order: I'm BTN, SB and BB already posted. BB raised. UTG (Seat 1) folded. Now it's on me (BTN). Then SB (Seat 4) acts, then back to BB if there's a raise. So SB could still raise.\n\nGiven all this, I think folding is prudent. 64s is too weak even in position against a raise. The pot odds aren't compelling enough, and there's still SB left to act who could squeeze. I should wait for better spots.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"64s is too weak against a BB raise, even with position.

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 2, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted BB 4, and Seat 1 folded. So it's folded to me on the button with just the blinds remaining.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from the search:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB) seems somewhat aggressive but also capable of folding. In hand 27, they folded to a big 3-bet when they had raised preflop.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB) has shown some aggression, raising from SB in hand 30 with 4h6h, and 3-betting preflop in hand 25.\n\nMy position is excellent - button. With both players having posted blinds, I could consider a steal attempt. However, 43s is extremely weak. Even for a button steal, this is near the bottom of my range.\n\nMy stack is 51.8 BB - healthy but not huge. If I raise and get called or 3-bet, I'll be playing a very weak hand out of position postflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6 (pot is 6). That's 1.5:1 odds, but the hand is so weak that these odds don't justify playing.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack and should preserve it. Getting involved with 43s could lead to difficult postflop situations.\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger hand. The blinds are small relative to my stack, so I can afford to be patient.\n\nDecision: Fold. This hand is too weak even for a button steal against opponents who have shown some aggression.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this situation. I'm in the BB with 5h 8s, a very weak hand. The SB just completed to 4 chips (called the BB). The pot is 8 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 2 call). I have 203 chips (50.8 BB). Opponent has 300 chips.\n\nLooking at opponent actions: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot recently (last 3 hands folded preflop). They raised to 12 in hand 29 and 28 in hand 21. They completed the SB here instead of raising, which suggests a weak hand.\n\nMy hand 5h 8s is terrible - unsuited, low cards, no straight potential. However, I'm getting to see a free flop from the BB since amount to call is 0. I could check and see a flop, or I could raise to try to take the pot down preflop.\n\nFactors:\n1. Hand strength: Very weak\n2. Position: BB - out of position postflop\n3. Stack sizes: I have 50.8 BB, opponent has 75 BB\n4. Opponent tendency: Recently folding a lot, completed SB rather than raising\n5. Pot odds: Free to check\n\nIf I raise, I'd need to make it at least 8 chips total (minimum raise). That's 4 more chips to raise from 4 to 8. The pot would be 12 chips (8 + my 4 extra). If opponent folds, I win 8 chips. If they call, I'm playing a weak hand out of position.\n\nGiven my terrible hand and being out of position, checking seems best. I get to see a flop for free. 5-8 offsuit has some very limited potential (could make a straight, but unlikely). The risk of raising with such a weak hand outweighs the potential reward.\n\nAlso, in tournament poker, preserving stack is important. No need to get involved with 5-8o out of position.\n\nI should check and see a flop. If the flop hits me somehow (two pair, straight draw), I can proceed cautiously. Otherwise, I can fold.\n\nLet me check.",

They have nothing and want to give up\n  2. They have a weak hand and want to see a free card\n  3. They're trapping with a strong hand (set, two pair, etc.)\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 50.8 BB - healthy stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands\n- Pot is small (8 chips)\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that:\n1. My hand is very weak (bottom pair, weak kicker)\n2. I'm out of position\n3. Board has high cards that likely hit opponent's range\n4. Pot is small\n5. I have a healthy stack\n\nThe best play is to check and see the turn for free. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called or raised by better hands. If opponent has nothing, they'll fold to a bet, but the pot is too small to justify bluffing with such a weak hand.\n\nI should check and hope to improve on the turn, but be prepared to fold if opponent bets.",

They limped preflop (just called the SB to BB), which suggests a weak to medium hand. From the opponent action history, I see they've been folding a lot preflop (hands 25-27, 30-32), but in hand 29 they raised preflop to 12, bet 18 on flop, then checked turn and river with 99 on a 4c 5d 6s 7s Jh board. That shows some aggression when they have a decent hand.\n\nCurrent situation: I have bottom pair with 8 kicker. The board has A and K high, which are both higher than my pair. The opponent could be checking with a weak Ace, King, or a draw. They might also have a medium pocket pair (like 66-TT) that's afraid of the A and K on board.\n\nGiven the small pot (8 chips) and my weak hand, I should probably check back and see a free river. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands (any Ace, King, better pair, or draws that have equity against me). My hand has very little value and minimal bluffing potential since I'm out of position.\n\nThe tournament context: I have 50.8 BB, which is healthy but not huge. No need to take unnecessary risks with a marginal hand in a small pot.\n\nHowever, I could consider a small bet for protection against draws (there's a flush draw with two spades on board: As and Ks are spades, plus 3d and 5c, so backdoor flush draw possible). But realistically, my hand is too weak to value bet.\n\nBetter to check and see what happens on the river. If opponent bets river, I can easily fold. If they check again, I might consider a small bet if I improve or check back.\n\nLet me check.",

They've shown some aggression (raised hand #21 and #29), but mostly folding. In hand #29, they raised preflop, bet flop, then checked turn and river. This suggests they might be capable of aggression but also capable of giving up.\n\n**Hand Progression:**\n- Preflop: SB limped, I checked in BB\n- Flop: Both checked\n- Turn: Both checked  \n- River: Opponent checked\n\nThis is a very passive line from both players. The board is A-K-5-3-8. With two pair, I'm likely ahead here. What could opponent have?\n\n**Possible Opponent Hands:**\n- Weak Ace (A-x, maybe A-2, A-4, A-6, A-7, A-9, etc.)\n- Weak King (K-x)\n- Middle pocket pair (QQ, JJ, TT, 99, etc.)\n- Missed draws (QJ, JT, maybe some spade draws that missed)\n- Possibly a slow-played monster (set, two pair)\n\n**Decision:**\nI have two pair on a dry board. The pot is tiny (8 chips). Opponent checked to me. I should value bet here to extract value from weaker hands like weak Aces or Kings. A small bet could get called by worse hands.\n\nHowever, there's also merit to checking back since:\n1. Pot is very small\n2. Opponent might fold most weak holdings anyway\n3. If opponent has a better hand (like A8 or 85, which gives them better two pair, or a set), they might check-raise\n\nBut given the passive line from opponent (limp preflop, check all streets), they're unlikely to have a monster. A set or better two pair would probably bet at some point.\n\n**Bet Sizing:**\nMinimum raise is 4 chips (total bet of 4). I could bet 4-8 chips (half to full pot). Since pot is only 8, a 4-chip bet seems reasonable.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nMy stack is healthy at 50BB. No need to take big risks, but this is a small pot with a likely winning hand.\n\nI think a small value bet is correct. Let me bet 6 chips (total)."

I need to respond with a JSON object containing 'action', 'raise_to' (if raising), and 'reasoning'. Let me reconsider the hand and provide the proper response.\n\nI'm on the river with 5h 8s on a board of 5c As Ks 3d 8c. I have two pair: fives and eights with an Ace kicker. The pot is 8 chips, opponent checked to me, and I have 0 to call. Legal actions are fold, check, raise.\n\nAnalysis: I have a strong hand - two pair. The board is dry: no flush possible (I have no spade, river is club), no straight possible. Opponent limped preflop and checked all streets. This suggests weakness. They could have a weak Ace, weak King, middle pocket pair, or missed draw. With two pair, I'm likely ahead.\n\nPot is tiny (8 chips). I should value bet. Minimum raise is 4 chips (total bet of 4). I could bet 4-8 chips. Since opponent seems passive, a small bet might get called by worse hands like weak Aces or Kings.\n\nBet sizing: I'll bet 6 chips total (raise_to 6). That's a 6-chip bet into 8-chip pot - reasonable.\n\nAction: raise. raise_to: 6. Reasoning: I have two pair on a dry board. Opponent has shown passive line (limp pre, check all streets). Small value bet to extract chips from weaker holdings like weak Aces or Kings. Pot is small, so no need to overbet.\n\nLet me format this as JSON.",

GPT-OSS-120B raised to 8 from what appears to be the cutoff or button position (Seat 5), and Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) called from early position. I need to call 6 chips to continue.\n\nLooking at the opponent actions: GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop in hand #32 to 24 chips (6x BB) and then bet aggressively on the flop. In this hand, they raised to 8 (2x BB), which is a smaller raise. Kimi-K2 Thinking has mostly been folding preflop but called a small amount in hand #33 and now called this raise.\n\nMy hand 3\u26605\u2663 is terrible - it's suited but only 3-5 offsuit, one of the weakest starting hands. I'm out of position (small blind) which makes playing this hand even worse. The pot odds: I need to call 6 chips into a pot of 22+6=28 if I call, so about 21.4% pot odds. But with such a weak hand, even if I hit a pair, it's likely dominated.\n\nIn tournament poker, preserving stack is important. With 52.2 BB, I have a decent stack. Calling 6 chips (1.5 BB) with this trash hand is burning chips. Even if I hit a miracle flop, I'm out of position and will struggle to realize equity.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot.

Shows aggressive tendencies, but has shown down some marginal hands like QTo, JKh. Likely to defend his SB with a wide range.\n2. **Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B - BB):** Also raises preflop frequently (6 times). Has shown down strong hands like KcAd, KsQs, AdTs.

From the button with no raises yet, this is a clear raising hand.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 52 BB, which is a healthy stack. I want to accumulate chips but also preserve my stack. Being on the button gives me positional advantage postflop.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Too weak - KQo on button is definitely playable\n2. **Call:** Would be okay but not maximizing value\n3. **Raise:** Best option - standard play with KQo on button\n\n**Raise sizing:** Minimum raise is to 8 (double the BB). But I should consider a larger raise to 12-16 to get value and potentially take down the blinds preflop. Looking at past patterns, opponents have raised to 8-12 in similar spots.\n\nGiven that both blinds have shown aggressive tendencies, I should raise to 12-16 to give myself a better chance to take it down preflop or play a larger pot with position.\n\nI'll raise to 12 (3x BB).

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation:\n\nHand #35, I'm on the BTN with Qs Kh. I raised preflop to 12 (3x BB). Both SB (MiniMax-M2) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B) called.\n\nFlop: Qd 6c 6s (paired board with my top pair, queen). Both opponents checked to me.\n\nMy hand: Top pair, decent kicker (king). Board is Qd 6c 6s - paired sixes. This is a good flop for my hand. I have top pair, and the paired board reduces the chance opponents have strong draws (no flush draws, only possible straight draws like 87, 54, but those are unlikely given preflop action).\n\nPot is 36 chips. My stack: 197 chips (49.2 BB). SB has 191 chips, BB has 256 chips.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see opponent tendencies:\n\nMiniMax-M2 (SB):\n- Has shown some aggression preflop (raising with various hands)\n- In hand 25, called a 3-bet preflop with Jh Kh on a 2s 2h Qd board, then check-called turn\n- In hand 30, bet small on flop with 4h 6h on 8d 9h 6c board, then check-called turn, then big river bet\n- Seems capable of bluffing and value betting\n\nGPT-OSS-120B (BB):\n- In hand 25, 3-bet preflop with Ad Ts, then checked flop on 2s 2h Qd, bet turn\n- In hand 30, raised preflop with 4h 6h, called small flop bet, bet small turn, folded to big river bet\n- In hand 32, 3-bet preflop with Kc Ad, bet flop on Ks 4s Qc, checked turn and river\n\nBoth seem like reasonable players. The check from both on this flop suggests they don't have strong hands (probably no Qx, no 6x). They could have pocket pairs below Q, suited connectors, or maybe slow-playing a monster (though unlikely with two checks).\n\nGiven I have position and top pair, I should bet for value. A bet of around half pot (18 chips) to 2/3 pot (24 chips) seems reasonable. I want to get value from weaker Qx hands (QJ, QT, Q9), pocket pairs (77-JJ), and some draws.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that the board is paired with sixes. This means if someone has a 6, they have trips and are likely slow-playing. But given preflop action, 6x hands are less likely (except maybe A6s, but even those might have folded to a raise). Both called my preflop raise, so their ranges should be decent.\n\nI could also check to see a turn card, but betting is better for value and protection. If I check back, I give free cards to hands like JT, T9, 87 that could make straights on turn.\n\nLet me think about sizing: Minimum raise is 8 (total bet of 8). I could bet 12-24. I'll go with 20 chips (a bit over half pot).\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 20,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Top pair with good kicker on paired board. Both opponents checked, indicating weakness. Betting for value against weaker Qx hands, pocket pairs, and to protect against draws. 20 chips is a reasonable half-pot+ bet that builds pot while not overcommitting.\"\n}",

The turn brought a K, giving me kings up with queens. \n\nThe pot is 96 chips. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) just bet 20 into me. I have to call 20. My stack is 177 chips, so calling 20 is reasonable. But I have a very strong hand - I should consider raising. The minimum raise is to 40 total (20 more). I could raise to build the pot.\n\nLet me think about opponent tendencies. Seat 4 called my preflop raise and called my flop bet. Now they lead out on the turn with a 20 chip bet into a 96 chip pot. This could be a value bet with a hand like a 6, a weaker queen, a king, or a draw. The board is paired with 6s, so there's a possibility they have trips. But I have top two pair, which is very strong.\n\nWith the flush draw on board (Kc on turn, board has Qd 6c 6s Kc - two clubs), they could be betting a flush draw. Or they could have a 6 for trips. But I should be ahead of most of their range.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 20 to win 116 (96 + 20). That's about 1:5.8 odds, so I only need about 15% equity. I have much more than that.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 177 chips (44 BB), which is a healthy stack. Building pots with strong hands is good.\n\nI should probably raise for value. A raise to maybe 60-80 would be good. Let me check legal actions - I can raise. The minimum raise is to 40, but I should raise more.\n\nGiven my strong hand and position, I'll raise to build the pot and charge draws. I'll raise to 80 total (adding 60 to the 20 call).

I have Qs and Kh, giving me two pair: Queens and Kings. But board already has two Queens (Qd and Qc), so I have trips Queens with a King kicker? Wait: board has Qd and Qc, I have Qs, so that's three Queens. Plus I have Kh, giving me a full house? Actually board is Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. That's Q-Q-6-6-K. I have Qs Kh. So my hand is Qs Qd Qc (three Queens) plus Kh and 6c? Wait best five-card hand: I have three Queens (Qs, Qd, Qc), plus a King (Kh), plus a 6 (6c). That's trips Queens with King kicker. But there's also two 6s on board. So board has two 6s. That means possible full houses: someone could have a 6 for quad 6s? No, quad 6s would require pocket 6s. Or someone could have Q6 for full house (Queens full of 6s). Or K6 for Kings full of 6s. Or pocket Kings for Kings full of Queens. Or pocket Queens for quad Queens. Or pocket Kings for Kings full of Queens. Actually pocket Kings would give K-K-Q-Q-6, which is Kings full of Queens.\n\nMy hand: Qs Kh. Board: Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. My best five: Qs Qd Qc Kh 6c = trips Queens, King kicker. Wait, but there's a King on board too (Kc). So I have two pair: Queens and Kings? Actually I have Qs and Kh, board has Qd, Qc, Kc, 6c, 6s. So I have two Queens (my Qs plus board Qd and Qc - I can use two of them? Actually I can use any five cards. I have Qs, Kh, and board Qd, Qc, Kc, 6c, 6s. Best combination: use Qs, Qd, Qc for three Queens, plus Kc and Kh for two Kings? Wait, I have Kh and board has Kc, so that's two Kings. So I have a full house: Queens full of Kings? Let's see: three Queens (Qs, Qd, Qc) and two Kings (Kh, Kc). That's Queens full of Kings. Yes! That's a full house. Board shows Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. I have Qs Kh. So my hand is Qs Qd Qc Kh Kc. That's three Queens and two Kings = Queens full of Kings. That's a very strong hand.\n\nBut there are possible better hands: quad Queens (if someone has Qx), quad 6s (pocket 6s), or better full houses: Kings full of Queens (if someone has KK), or Queens full of 6s (if someone has Q6), or Kings full of 6s (if someone has K6), or 6s full of Queens (if someone has 66). Actually 66 would be quad 6s, not full house. Let's list possible holdings that beat me:\n\n1. Pocket Kings (KK): would give Kings full of Queens (K\u2660 K\u2665 with board Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc = K\u2660 K\u2665 Kc Qd Qc = Kings full of Queens). That beats my Queens full of Kings.\n\n2. Pocket Queens (QQ): would give quad Queens.\n\n3. Q6: would give Queens full of 6s (Q\u2660 6\u2665 with board Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc = Q\u2660 Qd Qc 6\u2665 6c = Queens full of 6s). That beats my Queens full of Kings? Actually Queens full of 6s vs Queens full of Kings: both have three Queens, but the pair is 6s vs Kings. Kings are higher than 6s, so my Queens full of Kings beats Queens full of 6s. Wait, in full house ranking, the triplet rank is compared first. Both have three Queens, so we compare the pair: Kings vs 6s. Kings are higher, so my hand beats Q6. So Q6 is worse than my hand.\n\n4. K6: would give Kings full of 6s (K\u2660 6\u2665 with board Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc ="

That's a very strong full house.\n\nOpponent: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 31 chips total. They bet 60 on river, but they only have 31 chips? Wait, they have 31 chips total. They bet 60? That seems impossible. Let me check: \"river: Seat 4 bet 60\". But they only have 31 chips. Maybe they're all-in? Actually they have 31 chips, so betting 60 would be all-in for their remaining stack. The pot is 296 chips, amount to call is 60, but opponent only has 31 chips. Something seems off. Let me reconstruct the hand.\n\nPreflop: I raised to 12, Seat 4 called 10, Seat 5 called 8.\nFlop: I bet 20, Seat 4 called 20, Seat 5 folded.\nTurn: Seat 4 bet 20, I raised to 80, Seat 4 called 60.\nRiver: Seat 4 bet 60.\n\nBut Seat 4 started with 31 chips. Preflop they called 10, leaving 21. Flop they called 20, leaving 1. Turn they bet 20? That would put them all-in if they only had 1 left. Actually they bet 20 on turn, then I raised to 80, they called 60. But if they only had 1 chip after flop, they couldn't bet 20. Let me check stack sizes again: \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 31 chips\". That's current stack at start of river? Or at start of hand? Probably at start of hand. So they started with 31 chips.\n\nPreflop: They called 10 (SB was 2, so they called additional 10 to match my 12 raise). So they put in 12 total? Actually SB is 2, they called 10 more to make 12. So after preflop, they have 31-12=19 chips.\n\nFlop: They called 20. But they only have 19 chips, so they're all-in. Actually they can't call 20 with 19 chips - they'd be all-in for 19. So maybe the 20 bet was less? Or maybe stack sizes are current at this moment. Let me think: At river, they bet 60, but they have 31 chips total. So the bet of 60 must be all-in for their remaining stack. That means amount to call is 60, but I only need to call 60 to win the pot. My stack is 97 chips, so I can afford it.\n\nGiven the board and action, what could opponent have? They called preflop from SB, called flop, donk bet turn, called my raise, then bet river. This looks like they have a strong hand. Possible holdings: Q6, K6, maybe a flush draw that missed? Board has Qc and Kc and 6c and Qc? Actually board has Qc and Kc and 6c? Wait board: Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. So there are three clubs: 6c, Kc, Qc. That's a possible flush. But I don't have any clubs. Opponent could have been on a flush draw. But they bet turn before the third club came? Actually turn card was Qc? Wait board: Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. So flop was Qd 6c 6s. Turn was Kc. River was Qc. So turn brought the King of clubs, river brought the Queen of clubs. So on turn, there were two clubs (6c and Kc). River made three clubs. So if opponent had a flush draw on turn, they hit on river.\n\nBut their betting pattern: check-call flop, donk bet turn, call raise, then bet river. That's consistent with a flush draw that turned into a flush. Or they could have a full house. Given they're short-stacked (31 chips), they might be pushing with any decent hand.\n\nMy hand is very strong - Queens full of Kings. Only beaten by quad Queens, quad 6s, or Kings full of Queens (pocket Kings). Pocket Kings is unlikely given preflop action - I raised, they called from SB. Would they call with KK? Possibly. But also possible they have Q6 or K6 for lower full house, or a flush.\n\nPot is 296 chips, I need to call 60. That's about 5:1 pot odds. I have to"

I have Qs and Kh, giving me two pair: Queens and Kings. But board already has two Queens (Qd and Qc), so I have trips Queens with a King kicker? Wait: board has Qd and Qc, I have Qs, so that's three Queens. Plus I have Kh, giving me a full house? Actually board is Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. That's Q-Q-6-6-K. I have Qs Kh. So my hand is Qs Qd Qc (three Queens) plus Kh and 6c? Wait best five-card hand: I have three Queens (Qs, Qd, Qc), plus a King (Kh), plus a 6 (6c). That's trips Queens with King kicker. But there's also two 6s on board. So board has two 6s. That means possible full houses: someone could have a 6 for quad 6s? No, quad 6s would require pocket 6s. Or someone could have Q6 for full house (Queens full of 6s). Or K6 for Kings full of 6s. Or pocket Kings for Kings full of Queens. Or pocket Queens for quad Queens. Or pocket Kings for Kings full of Queens. Actually pocket Kings would give K-K-Q-Q-6, which is Kings full of Queens.\n\nMy hand: Qs Kh. Board: Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. My best five: Qs Qd Qc Kh 6c = trips Queens, King kicker. Wait, but there's a King on board too (Kc). So I have two pair: Queens and Kings? Actually I have Qs and Kh, board has Qd, Qc, Kc, 6c, 6s. So I have two Queens (my Qs plus board Qd and Qc - I can use two of them? Actually I can use any five cards. I have Qs, Kh, and board Qd, Qc, Kc, 6c, 6s. Best combination: use Qs, Qd, Qc for three Queens, plus Kc and Kh for two Kings? Wait, I have Kh and board has Kc, so that's two Kings. So I have a full house: Queens full of Kings? Let's see: three Queens (Qs, Qd, Qc) and two Kings (Kh, Kc). That's Queens full of Kings. Yes! That's a full house. Board shows Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc. I have Qs Kh. So my hand is Qs Qd Qc Kh Kc. That's three Queens and two Kings = Queens full of Kings. That's a very strong hand.\n\nBut there are possible better hands: quad Queens (if someone has Qx), quad 6s (pocket 6s), or better full houses: Kings full of Queens (if someone has KK), or Queens full of 6s (if someone has Q6), or Kings full of 6s (if someone has K6), or 6s full of Queens (if someone has 66). Actually 66 would be quad 6s, not full house. Let's list possible holdings that beat me:\n\n1. Pocket Kings (KK): would give Kings full of Queens (K\u2660 K\u2665 with board Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc = K\u2660 K\u2665 Kc Qd Qc = Kings full of Queens). That beats my Queens full of Kings.\n\n2. Pocket Queens (QQ): would give quad Queens.\n\n3. Q6: would give Queens full of 6s (Q\u2660 6\u2665 with board Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc = Q\u2660 Qd Qc 6\u2665 6c = Queens full of 6s). That beats my Queens full of Kings? Actually Queens full of 6s vs Queens full of Kings: both have three Queens, but the pair is 6s vs Kings. Kings are higher than 6s, so my Queens full of Kings beats Queens full of 6s. Wait, in full house ranking, the triplet rank is compared first. Both have three Queens, so we compare the pair: Kings vs 6s. Kings are higher, so my hand beats Q6. So Q6 is worse than my hand.\n\n4. K6: would give Kings full of 6s (K\u2660 6\u2665 with board Qd 6c 6s Kc Qc =",

My hand is Queens full of Kings (three Queens, two Kings). That's a very strong full house.\n\nOpponent: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 31 chips total. They bet 60 on river, but they only have 31 chips? Wait, they have 31 chips total. They bet 60? That seems impossible. Let me check: \"river: Seat 4 bet 60\". But they only have 31 chips. Maybe they're all-in? Actually they have 31 chips, so betting 60 would be all-in for their remaining stack. The pot is 296 chips, amount to call is 60, but opponent only has 31 chips. Something seems off. Let me reconstruct the hand.\n\nPreflop: I raised to 12, Seat 4 called 10, Seat 5 called 8.\nFlop: I bet 20, Seat 4 called 20, Seat 5 folded.\nTurn: Seat 4 bet 20, I raised to 80, Seat 4 called 60.\nRiver: Seat 4 bet 60.\n\nBut Seat 4 started with 31 chips. Preflop they called 10, leaving 21. Flop they called 20, leaving 1. Turn they bet 20? That would put them all-in if they only had 1 left. Actually they bet 20 on turn, then I raised to 80, they called 60. But if they only had 1 chip after flop, they couldn't bet 20. Let me check stack sizes again: \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 31 chips\". That's current stack at start of river? Or at start of hand? Probably at start of hand. So they started with 31 chips.\n\nPreflop: They called 10 (SB was 2, so they called additional 10 to match my 12 raise). So they put in 12 total? Actually SB is 2, they called 10 more to make 12. So after preflop, they have 31-12=19 chips.\n\nFlop: They called 20. But they only have 19 chips, so they're all-in. Actually they can't call 20 with 19 chips - they'd be all-in for 19. So maybe the 20 bet was less? Or maybe stack sizes are current at this moment. Let me think: At river, they bet 60, but they have 31 chips total. So the bet of 60 must be all-in for their remaining stack. That means amount to call is 60, but I only need to call 60 to win the pot.

The 3x raise from SB is standard.\n\nMy hand JTo is decent but not great, especially offsuit. It's a hand that can make straights and sometimes top pair, but has reverse implied odds (dominated by AJ, KJ, QJ, etc.).\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 16, which is 2:1 odds (33% equity needed). JTo vs a typical SB raising range (maybe 30-40% of hands) has about 35-40% equity, so pot odds are favorable.\n\nHowever, position is bad - I'll be out of position postflop. JTo plays poorly out of position.\n\nStack sizes: I have a healthy stack (97 BB), opponent has 74 BB. Not deep enough for implied odds to play speculative hands.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm in good chip position, no need to take marginal spots.\n\nGiven this is heads-up SB vs BB, ranges widen considerably. SB should be raising wide, and BB should be defending wide. But JTo is near the bottom of a defending range.\n\nI could consider a 3-bet bluff since SB might be raising light, but with JTo and out of position, that's risky.\n\nBetter to just call and see a flop with decent pot odds, then play carefully postflop. If I hit a good flop (pair + straight draw, etc.), I can continue. Otherwise, fold.\n\nLet me call and see a flop.",

Wait, board is K-A-9, my J-T gives me an open-ended straight draw? Let me check: Board: Kd, Ad, 9h. My Js Td. Possible straights: QJ-T-9-8? Actually, with K-A-9 on board and J-T in hand, I need a Q for a straight (K-Q-J-T-9). That's a gutshot, not open-ended. Also have backdoor flush potential with the Td and board having Kd, but only one diamond so far. Very weak made hand - only high card is J, but board has K and A higher. Basically I have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs to a Q) and very little else.\n\n**Position:** I'm in BB, opponent is SB who raised preflop. They checked to me on the flop.\n\n**Opponent Analysis from memory:**\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has shown aggressive preflop raising tendencies (5 raises in 36 hands)\n- They've shown hands like 9s8s, 9s9d, As8h at showdown\n- On the flop, they often check (multiple instances) but also bet sometimes\n- In hand #29 with 99, they bet 18 on flop after raising preflop\n- In hand #6 with 98s, they bet 28 on flop\n\n**Pot Odds:** Pot is 24, I can check for free or bet. If I bet and get called, I need to consider future streets.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I have a healthy stack (381 vs opponent's 298). This is a marginal spot where I could try to take the pot with a bet, but need to be careful.\n\n**Possible Actions:**\n1. **Check:** Take a free card with my gutshot draw. Safe play given weak hand.\n2. **Bet:** Try to take the pot down now. Opponent checked, which could indicate weakness. A bet of around 12-16 (half pot) might work.\n\n**Opponent Range:** They raised preflop from SB. Could have: pairs (especially medium pairs like TT-QQ, maybe 99), Broadway cards (AQ, AJ, KQ, etc.), suited connectors. The flop K-A-9 hits a lot of their raising range (AK, AQ, AJ, KQ, maybe AA, KK, 99). But they checked, which suggests they might not have hit strongly or have a medium-strength hand.\n\n**My Image:** From my hand history, I recently won a big pot with QsKh (hand #35) and have been playing fairly tight.\n\n**Decision:** I think a small bet could work here. Opponent checked, which often shows weakness after raising preflop. They might fold hands like medium pairs (TT-QQ) that are afraid of the A and K on board. My bet would represent strength - maybe I have an A or K. Even if called, I still have my gutshot draw.\n\nBut I need to consider: If I bet and get raised, I'll have to fold. That would be bad. However, looking at opponent's history, they don't seem to check-raise much on flop (search showed no matches).\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The board is Kd Ad 9h. This is a very wet board that hits a lot of raising ranges. My J-high is basically air with a gutshot. A bet here is a pure bluff. Is it a good bluff?\n\nFactors favoring a bluff:\n1. Opponent checked (showing weakness)\n2. I'm out of position, so taking initiative could help\n3. Board has A and K, which are scare cards for many hands\n\nFactors against bluffing:\n1. I have some equity (gutshot) so checking to see a free card isn't terrible\n2. Opponent might call with any pair or draw\n3. If called, I'll be out of position on later streets\n\nGiven my tournament chip stack is healthy, I think checking is reasonable. I can see a free turn card and potentially hit my straight. If I miss, I can give up unless the turn improves my hand in some way.\n\nActually, wait - I'm in the BB"

Actually, with K-A-9 on board and J-T in hand, I need a Q for a straight (K-Q-J-T-9). That's a gutshot, not open-ended. Also have backdoor flush potential with the Td and board having Kd, but only one diamond so far. Very weak made hand - only high card is J, but board has K and A higher.

Very weak made hand. \n\nOpponent checked. Could be checking with a strong hand to trap, or weak hand. From memory, opponent is somewhat aggressive but not excessively so. They've shown hands like 98s, 99, A8s. \n\nIf I bet, I'm representing strength on an A-high board. Could get folds from medium pairs, maybe some weak aces. But if opponent has an ace or king, they'll likely call or raise. \n\nPot odds: Checking is free. Betting risks chips with a weak hand. \n\nGiven I have some equity (gutshot ~8% to hit on turn, ~16% by river), taking a free card seems reasonable. Also, I'm out of position, which makes bluffing harder on later streets. \n\nI think check is the better play here. Take the free card, evaluate turn. If I hit my straight, great.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand: #37**\n- My position: BB (Seat 3)\n- My cards: Js Td\n- My stack: 381 chips (95.2 BB)\n- Board: Kd Ad 9h 8s (turn)\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Opponent: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) with 298 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (opponent checked)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have Js Td on a board of Kd Ad 9h 8s. I have a straight draw - any Queen gives me a straight (Q gives me J-T-9-8-Q straight, but wait... actually I need a Queen for a straight? Let me think: Board is K-A-9-8. I have J-T. So my hand is J-T. For a straight, I need a Queen for J-T-Q-K-A (broadway) or a 7 for 7-8-9-T-J. So I have an open-ended straight draw with 8 outs (four 7s and four Qs). However, the board has two diamonds (Kd, Ad) but my Js Td includes the Td, so I have a backdoor flush draw with one diamond.\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nSeat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has shown:\n- Preflop: Raises (12 in hand 29), folds, calls, etc.\n- Postflop: In hand 29, they bet flop (18), checked turn and river with 99 on a 4-5-6-7-J board\n- In hand 33, they checked through all streets with weak hand\n- In hand 34, they checked through all streets with A8o on a 3-2-7-2-8 board\n\nThey seem to be a cautious player who checks when weak or when board is scary. Their check on the turn here could indicate weakness or a trap.\n\n**Pot odds and situation:**\nPot is 24 chips. I can check to see a free river, or bet for value/protection. With an open-ended straight draw (8 outs), I have about 17% chance to hit on the river (8/46 \u2248 17.4%). If I bet and get called, I need to consider implied odds.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack of 381 chips (95 BB). Opponent has 298 chips. I have position (acted last on turn). Checking gives me a free river card, which is good for my draw. Betting could get folds from weaker hands, but might also get raised by stronger hands.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that:\n1. I have a decent draw (open-ended straight, backdoor flush)\n2. Opponent checked twice (preflop raiser checked flop and turn, suggesting weakness)\n3. Pot is relatively small (24 chips)\n4. I have position\n\nI think checking is reasonable to see a free river. Betting could be good for protection if I think opponent has a weak hand that might outdraw me, but with my draw, I want to see the river cheaply. However, a small bet might also be good to build the pot if I hit.\n\nActually, let me think about opponent's range. They raised preflop from SB to 12 (3x BB). What could they have? Could be strong hands like AK, AQ, AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, or medium pairs, or suited connectors. The board has K-A-9-8 with two diamonds. They checked flop and turn. If they had top pair (AK) or two pair, they might bet. Their check suggests either a weak hand or a trap.\n\nGiven that I have position and a draw, checking seems fine. But a small bet could also work to apply pressure.\n\nActually, I should consider that if I check, opponent might bet river if they improve or if I miss. But I have position, so I can decide on river.\n\nI think I'll check to see the river for free. If I hit my straight, I can bet for value. If I miss, I can check or bluff depending on the river card.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking to see a free river with open-ended straight draw (8 outs).

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n- My hand: Js Td\n- Board: Kd Ad 9h 8s\n- I have an open-ended straight draw: I need a Q (for QJT98 straight) or a 7 (for JT987 straight). That's 8 outs.\n- Opponent (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised preflop from SB, then checked both flop and turn.\n- The pot is only 24 chips.\n- I have position on opponent.\n- My stack is 381 chips (95 BB), opponent has 298 chips.\n\nFrom the opponent history, they seem to be playing passively - mostly checking and calling. They raised preflop this hand (12 total), but then checked twice. This could indicate they have a hand like AK, AQ, or maybe a pocket pair that missed the flop.\n\nSince the pot is small and I have a strong draw, I could consider betting to try to win the pot now. However, betting might fold out weaker hands that I want to keep in the pot. Checking gives me a free river card with 8 outs (~16% chance to hit on river, ~32% chance from turn).\n\nGiven opponent's passive tendencies and the small pot size, checking seems reasonable to see a free river. If I hit my straight on the river, I can then bet for value.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that my hand has some showdown value if I don't hit - J high is weak, but opponent's checking suggests they might not have much either.\n\nActually, wait - I should think about this more carefully. The board is Kd Ad 9h 8s. There are flush draws possible (diamonds). My Js Td gives me a diamond draw too (Td). So I have additional equity with backdoor flush potential.\n\nBut the main consideration: checking is free, betting risks getting raised or called when I'm drawing. Since opponent raised preflop, they likely have at least some strength. Their turn check after checking flop could be a trap with a strong hand like two pair or a set.\n\nGiven the small pot and my position advantage, checking seems best. I'll take the free card and evaluate on the river.",

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation:\n\nHand #37, I'm in BB with Js Td. Board: Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s. Pot: 24 chips. Opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has checked on the river. I have 381 chips (95.2 BB). Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand: Js Td gives me a straight draw that missed. Board has Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s. I have jack-high, no pair, no flush draw (I have Js but board has 4s, not enough for flush). Best possible hand is a straight with QJ, but I have JT, so I need a Q for a straight, but board already has K and A, so QJ would give me a straight to the Ace, but I don't have Q. Actually, wait: Board is Kd Ad 9h 8s 4s. With JT, I need a Q for a straight (QJ T 9 8). But no Q on board. So I have jack-high, no pair.\n\nOpponent's actions: preflop raise from SB to 12 (3x BB), I called from BB. Flop: Kd Ad 9h - opponent checked, I checked. Turn: 8s - opponent checked, I checked. River: 4s - opponent checked.\n\nOpponent likely has a weak hand that missed or a medium pair. They raised preflop from SB, which could be a wide range. Then checked flop, turn, and river. This suggests weakness. They might have missed completely or have a small pair.\n\nPot is 24 chips. If I bet, I could potentially take it down with a bluff. However, I have jack-high, which is very weak. But opponent has shown weakness throughout.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been fairly passive - checking and folding often. In hand #33, they checked river and then folded. In hand #34, they called preflop then checked all streets. In hand #35, they folded preflop. In hand #36, they checked and then folded on flop.\n\nThis opponent seems cautious and likely to fold to aggression.\n\nMy stack is healthy at 381 chips (95 BB). A small bet could win the 24 chip pot. If I get called, I lose, but risk is low.\n\nConsidering pot odds: If I bet 12 chips (half pot), I need opponent to fold more than 33% of the time to be profitable. Given opponent's passive tendencies, they might fold a lot.\n\nBut I should also consider that my hand has absolutely no showdown value. Jack-high will almost certainly lose if we go to showdown. So checking gives me 0% chance to win. Betting gives me some chance.\n\nHowever, I need to think about what hands opponent might have that they'd check three times. They raised preflop, so could have: medium pairs (TT, JJ, QQ?), suited connectors, broadway cards. Flop has K and A, which hit many of their raising range. Their check on flop could be cautious with a hand like QQ, JJ, TT, or maybe a weak ace. But then checking turn and river suggests they don't have a strong hand.\n\nThey might have a small pair like 77 or 66, or maybe a hand like QJ, QT, JT similar to mine. Or maybe a busted draw.\n\nGiven the board has two spades, but I have Js, so they can't have a flush with J-high. Flush would require 3 spades on board, but there are only 2 (8s and 4s).\n\nI think a small value bet/bluff is reasonable. But I need to decide amount. Minimum raise is 8 chips, but I can bet any amount from 4 to my stack.\n\nI could bet 12 chips (half pot) or 8 chips (minimum). Smaller bet more likely to get called by weak hands, larger bet more likely to get folds but costs more if called.\n\nGiven opponent's passivity, I think a small bet of 8-12 chips could work.\n\nLet me also consider tournament implications: I have a healthy stack, no need to take big risks. But this is a small pot relative to my stack.\n\nActually, wait: I'm in BB, opponent in SB. They raised preflop, which is standard for SB vs BB. Their range is wide. My call with JTo is marginal but okay from BB getting good odds.\n\nI think I'll bet small to try to take it down."

While I'm on the button and the BB is short-stacked (33 chips), this hand has almost no postflop playability. The short stack could easily shove any two cards, putting me in a difficult spot. With 100.8 BB stack, preserving chips is better than playing this marginal spot with a terrible hand. Fold and wait for better opportunities.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3c 9d - This is a very weak hand. 93o is one of the worst possible hands in poker. It has very little potential to make strong hands postflop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (button), which is the best position. However, with such a weak hand, position alone doesn't justify playing.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 403 chips (100.8 BB) - a healthy stack\n   - MiniMax-M2 has only 33 chips (8.25 BB) - very short stacked\n   - The other players have folded\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**: MiniMax-M2 is the big blind with a tiny stack. From the recalled actions, they seem to be playing somewhat loose/calling stations but also capable of betting. With only 33 chips, they're likely to play any two cards aggressively since they're desperate.\n\n5. **Situation**: It's folded to me on the button. I posted the small blind of 2, and need to call 2 more to complete to the big blind of 4. The pot is 6 chips (2 SB + 4 BB). \n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 to win 6, which is 3:1 odds (25% equity needed). Even with 93o, I have about 35-40% equity against a random hand preflop. However, the opponent is short-stacked and could easily shove any two cards.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I have a big stack and should avoid marginal spots\n   - The short stack is desperate and could shove with any two\n   - Playing 93o from the button against a short stack might be tempting to steal, but it's very high variance\n\n8. **Better approach**: With such a weak hand, folding is correct. Even though I have position and the opponent is short, 93o is simply too weak. The risk of the short stack shoving and me having to fold or call with a terrible hand isn't worth the 2 chips.\n\n9. **Alternative consideration**: If I had a stronger hand or if the opponent had a more normal stack, I might consider raising to steal. But with a short stack who could easily shove, and with such a terrible hand, folding is best.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

However, I have position advantage on both remaining players (SB and BB). The SB (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) has only 37 chips (9.25 BB) - very short stacked. The BB (Seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) has 250 chips (62.5 BB).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB, 37 chips): Has shown some aggression (betting on turn and river in hand 35) but is now very short-stacked. Likely to play tight or go all-in with decent hands.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB, 250 chips): Has been folding recently (folded last 3 hands preflop). Showed a raise with Ks Qs in hand 34, but generally seems cautious.\n\nMy stack is 403 chips (100.8 BB) - healthy stack.\n\nGiven the situation:\n1. The SB is extremely short and could easily go all-in\n2. The BB has been folding frequently\n3. I have position on both\n4. My hand is weak but has some potential with an Ace\n\nI could consider raising to try to steal the blinds, but with A3o, it's marginal. However, the SB's short stack makes this interesting - if I raise and SB goes all-in, I'd have to call given pot odds. But SB only has 37 chips total.\n\nActually, let me think about pot odds: If I raise to say 12 (3x BB), and SB goes all-in for 37, the pot would be: SB's 37 + BB's 4 + my 12 = 53. I'd need to call 25 more (37-12) to win 53, getting about 2.1:1 odds. With A3o against a short-stack's range, I'd likely be behind but might have decent equity.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and my healthy stack, I think the best play is to fold this weak hand.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to think about my hand: 3s Qc. This is a weak hand from UTG (under the gun). Q3 offsuit is a very marginal hand that should typically be folded from early position. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Q3 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands. It has very little potential to make strong hands postflop. No suitedness, no connectivity, low card values.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in UTG (Seat 3), which is the worst position at the table. I'll be acting first on every postflop street, which makes playing weak hands even more difficult.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 403 chips (100.8 BB) - healthy stack\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB): 294 chips\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB? Actually seat 4): 43 chips (very short stack)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (SB): 248 chips\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: From the data:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking raises preflop frequently (6 times in limited sample)\n   - MiniMax-M2 raises preflop very frequently (9 times in sample, often small raises like 4 or 8 chips)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B also raises preflop (6 times)\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 100+ BB, I should be playing tight and preserving my stack. There's no need to play marginal hands from early position.\n\n6. **Action to take**: I need to call 4 chips to see the flop. The pot is currently 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4). If I call, pot becomes 10 chips.\n\nHowever, with Q3o from UTG, this is an easy fold. The hand has terrible reverse implied odds - if I hit a Q, I could easily be dominated by AQ, KQ, QJ, etc. If I hit a 3, it's a weak pair that's vulnerable to overcards.\n\nEven though it's only 4 chips (1% of my stack), calling with such a weak hand from early position is a mistake. Better to wait for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors: The short stack MiniMax-M2 has only 43 chips (10.75 BB) and is in the small blind position (though the display says Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 43 chips, and Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 248 chips posted SB 2). Actually looking at the actions: \"preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 2\" and \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 4\". So Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is SB, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is BB. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) hasn't acted yet and will be after me.\n\nSo the action order: I'm UTG (first to act), then MiniMax-M2, then GPT-OSS-120B (SB), then Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB).\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 raises frequently preflop (especially small raises like 4 chips), there's a good chance he'll raise after I call. Then I'd have to call more chips or fold after putting in 4.\n\nThis makes folding even more correct.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "I can see from my hand history that I've been folding most hands from UTG position, which is generally correct for tight early position play. Looking at my current hand: 3s Qc. This is a very weak hand - Queen-high with a 3 offsuit. Queen-3 offsuit is not a playable hand from UTG in tournament poker. It has very little potential to make strong hands postflop, and being out of position makes it even worse.\n\nConsidering the situation:\n- I'm UTG (first to act preflop)\n- Hand: Q3o (very weak)\n- Stack: 403 chips (100.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Players behind: MiniMax-M2 (43 chips - short stack), GPT-OSS-120B (248 chips), and Kimi-K2 Thinking (294 chips)\n\nWith Q3o from UTG, the correct play is to fold. This hand has reverse implied odds - if I hit a Queen, I could be dominated by better Queens. If I hit a 3, it's a weak pair. The hand doesn't have good connectivity or suitedness.\n\nLooking at my past UTG plays, I've been folding similarly weak hands like 7-5s, T-2s, 7-As, Q-8o, K-4o, etc. This hand is worse than most of those.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy 100BB stack, so no need to gamble with marginal hands from early position. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots.\n\nThe pot odds don't matter here because the hand is too weak to play regardless of price.\n\nTherefore, I should fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand:** Jh Qh (suited connectors)\n**Position:** SB (small blind)\n**Stack:** 403 chips (50.4 BB)\n**Opponent:** Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) with 272 chips\n**Action:** Kimi-K2 Thinking raised to 24 total (3x BB)\n**Amount to call:** 20 (from my SB of 4 already posted)\n**Pot:** Currently 36 (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24)\n\nFrom the opponent action recall, I see Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised preflop 6 times in 41 hands:\n- Hand 4: raise 7 (likely from UTG)\n- Hand 14: raise 6\n- Hand 18: raise 6  \n- Hand 21: raise 28 (big raise)\n- Hand 29: raise 12\n- Hand 37: raise 12\n\nThis shows a mix of raise sizes, but generally on the smaller side (6-12 chips) except for one big 28 chip raise. The current raise to 24 is on the larger side.\n\n**My hand analysis:** QJs is a strong hand from SB, especially suited. It has good postflop potential with straight and flush possibilities. Against a single raiser, this is definitely a playable hand.\n\n**Position consideration:** I'm out of position (SB), which is a disadvantage postflop. However, the opponent is UTG+1 (Seat 1) and the BB has only 35 chips (short stack). The BB might fold or call with a wide range since they're short.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 403 chips (50.4 BB), opponent has 272 chips (34 BB). I have a significant stack advantage.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 36, I need to call 20. That's 1.8:1 pot odds (36:20). I need ~36% equity to break even. QJs likely has >40% equity against a typical UTG raising range.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have a healthy stack and can afford to play this hand. Folding would be too tight with QJs.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Too tight with QJs getting good pot odds\n2. **Call:** Reasonable, but out of position\n3. **Raise:** Could 3-bet to isolate the short-stacked BB and take initiative\n\nGiven the opponent's mixed raise sizes and my hand strength, I think a 3-bet is best. The BB is very short (35 chips) and might call with almost any two cards. By raising, I can:\n1. Isolate against the original raiser\n2. Take initiative postflop\n3. Potentially win the pot preflop\n4. Build a pot with a strong drawing hand\n\nI should raise to around 60-80 chips. Let's go with 72 chips (3x the raise of 24). This is a standard 3-bet size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 72,\n  \"reasoning\": \"QJs is strong enough to 3-bet from SB against UTG raiser.

It's not suited, has low connectivity, and J-high is not strong. This is a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is great, but with such a weak hand, position alone doesn't justify playing.\n\n3. **Opponent stacks**: MiniMax-M2 only has 82 chips (10.25 BB) and is in the SB. They're short-stacked and might be forced to defend with a wide range. GPT-OSS-120B has 240 chips (30 BB) in the BB.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: From the search results:\n   - MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression with raises preflop\n   - In hand #42, MiniMax-M2 called a 3-bet with JhQh from SB position\n   - They seem willing to play hands\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 45.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with junk hands.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Calling 8 to win 12 gives me 1.5:1 odds, but with such a weak hand, I'm not getting the implied odds to justify playing.\n\n7. **Alternative actions**: \n   - Raise: Could try to steal blinds, but J6o is too weak for this. If called, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position post-flop.\n   - Call: See a cheap flop, but J6o flops poorly and I'll likely have to fold to any aggression.\n\nGiven the weakness of J6o, the fact that I have two opponents behind me (one short-stacked who might be forced to defend), and my healthy stack size, the correct play is to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nI should preserve my chips and look for better opportunities with stronger hands. The button position is valuable, but not valuable enough to play J6o.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations from my hand history... Looking at my recent hands, I've been folding a lot (28 folds out of 42 hands). That's okay - tight play is often correct in tournaments.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop decision with Kd4d from UTG. Let me think through this:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: K4s is a marginal hand from UTG. It's suited, which gives it some flush potential, but K4 is a weak kicker. In early position, this is generally a fold.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll have to act first on all future streets, making it hard to play postflop.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes**: \n   - I have 364 chips (45.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has only 78 chips (9.75 BB) - very short stack\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 252 chips (31.5 BB)\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 264 chips (33 BB)\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression (raised to 24 in hand 42), but mostly folds preflop. Has shown down mediocre hands like 9s8s, 9s9d, As8h.\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has called raises with QsAs (hand 42), shows willingness to play. Has only 78 chips - likely to shove with any decent hand.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Mostly folds preflop, but has shown down KcAd, KsQs, AdTs - plays premium hands.\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should avoid marginal spots from early position. The short stack (Seat 4) could shove any time, and I don't want to be caught with K4s.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 8 to win 12 (pot is 12). That's 1.5:1 odds, but position and hand strength make this unfavorable.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- K4s from UTG is a clear fold in most situations\n- I'm out of position against 3 players yet to act\n- The short stack could shove, putting me in a tough spot\n- Better to wait for stronger hands in better positions\n\nI should fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze the current hand situation. I'm in the small blind with Qd Ks, a decent hand. The pot is 28 chips (4 SB + 8 BB + 8 from seat 4 call + 8 from seat 5 call). Seat 1 folded. I'm in the small blind, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called, seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called. I have 356 chips (44.5 BB). \n\nFrom opponent history:\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, 70 chips): Has been calling preflop frequently, seems passive. Stack is short (70 chips, 8.75 BB).\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, 256 chips): Has shown some aggression postflop with bets on flop.\n\nMy hand KQo is strong from the small blind. I have position disadvantage since I'll act first postflop, but I'm closing the action preflop. \n\nOptions:\n1. Check: Take a free flop with KQo. This is conservative but reasonable given position disadvantage.\n2. Raise: Build the pot with a strong hand, potentially isolate the short stack or take it down preflop. Minimum raise to 16 (double the current bet).\n\nGiven the short stack in seat 4 (70 chips), raising could put pressure on them. My stack is healthy at 356 chips. KQo plays well heads-up or multiway. A raise to 20-24 might be good to build pot and define hands.\n\nI should consider that both opponents have shown willingness to call preflop. MiniMax-M2 has called multiple times. GPT-OSS-120B called last hand. A raise might get calls from both.\n\nPot odds: If I raise to 16 (additional 8), pot becomes 36, giving me 2.25:1 immediate odds if both call. But more importantly, I have a strong hand that can win without improvement.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, should play aggressively with good hands. KQo is top 10% hand.\n\nI think a raise is best here. Let's raise to 20 chips total (12 more). This is 2.5x the BB, reasonable sizing.",

We raised preflop from BB after two limpers, and both called. The pot is 64 chips.\n\nOur hand: King-high with a backdoor flush draw (spades) and backdoor straight potential (need J and T or A and T). Not a great flop for us - missed completely. We have two overcards but the board is low and dry.\n\nOpponents:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 58 chips (very short stack, 7.25 BB). From the history, they've been calling a lot preflop and have shown some decent hands (Qs As, Qh Jh, etc). They're very short and likely to commit with any decent hand.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 244 chips (30.5 BB). From history, they've been folding a lot preflop but when they play, they tend to bet aggressively on flops. In hand 43, they bet 30 on flop after checking preflop. In hand 44, they bet 48 on flop after calling preflop. Seems to be a somewhat aggressive player postflop.\n\nPosition: We're out of position (SB), which is bad. We have to act first on every street.\n\nGiven the dry board and our weak hand, I think checking is correct. We could consider a continuation bet since we raised preflop, but with two callers and a dry board that likely hit their calling ranges (pairs, draws), a c-bet might not be effective. Also, seat 5 has shown aggression on flops, so if we bet and get raised, we're in a tough spot.\n\nPot odds: If we check and someone bets, we'd need to consider calling. But with just King-high and backdoor draws, we'd need good odds.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been c-betting much.",

However, I have position on both players for the rest of the hand (they act after me on flop, turn, river).\n\nActually wait - I'm SB, so I act first on flop, turn, river. That's bad position.\n\nLet me think about ranges:\n- I raised from SB after limpers. My range should be strong.\n- MiniMax called from BB? Actually Seat 4 is MiniMax, who called preflop. They limped then called my raise. Could have a wide range.\n- GPT-OSS called from UTG? Actually Seat 5 is GPT-OSS, who also limped then called.\n\nGiven the low board, a c-bet might take it down. But if called, I'm out of position with a marginal hand.\n\nI should check to see what they do. If they check behind, I get a free card. If they bet, I can evaluate.\n\nBetter to check here.

          "content": "I'm in a tournament, SB position with Qd Ks. Board is 3h 6s 4s. I have 344 chips (43 BB). I posted BB 8, then raised to 20 preflop (so 12 more). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called, and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called. Seat 4 has only 28 chips left (after calling 12 preflop? Wait, they have 28 chips now, but they called 12 preflop and then bet 30 on flop? That seems impossible if they only have 28 chips total. Let's examine: Seat 4 started with 28 chips. They called 8 preflop (limped), then I raised to 20, they called 12 more (total 20). That would leave them with 8 chips. Then they bet 30 on flop? That can't be right. Maybe the stack display is current stack after actions? Actually, the stack display is likely current stack after posting blinds/calls. Let's recalc: Seat 4 started with 28 chips. They posted no blind (they're not SB/BB). They called 8 preflop (limped). Then I raised to 20, they called 12 more, total 20 invested. That leaves 8 chips. Then they bet 30 on flop? That's impossible. Maybe the stack display is before the hand? Or maybe they have 28 chips remaining after the flop bet? But they bet 30, which would be more than they have. Hmm.\n\nLet me read again: \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 28 chips\". That's likely their current stack after posting blinds/calls. So they have 28 chips left. They called 12 preflop (total 20). Then on flop they bet 30? That would be all-in if they only have 28 left. Actually, the bet size is 30, but they might be all-in for less. The amount to call is 30, but if Seat 4 has only 28 chips, the effective bet might be 28. However, Seat 5 called 30, so maybe Seat 4 actually has more chips? Let's check the pot size: Pot is 124 chips. Preflop: SB posted 4, BB (me) posted 8, Seat 4 called 8, Seat 5 called 8, I raised 20 (so added 12 more), Seat 4 called 12, Seat 5 called 12. That's 4+8+8+8+12+12+12 = 64? Wait: 4+8=12, +8=20, +8=28, +12=40, +12=52, +12=64. Pot preflop should be 64. But pot is 124 on flop. That includes flop bets: Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, so 64+30+30=124. So Seat 4 indeed bet 30, and Seat 5 called 30. So Seat 4 must have had at least 30 chips after preflop. So maybe the stack display is before the hand started? Let's assume Seat 4 has 28 chips now after betting 30? That would mean they had 58 chips before hand, invested 20 preflop, leaving 38, then bet 30 leaving 8. But display shows 28. Could be a mistake. Let's not overthink; we know Seat 4 is short-stacked (28 chips). They bet 30, which is likely all-in (or close). Seat 5 called 30. So there's a side pot between me and Seat 5 if I call.\n\nMy hand: Qd Ks. Board: 3h 6s 4s. I have overcards, no flush draw (I have Ks, but board has two spades; I have Qd not spade). So I have two overcards (K and Q) to a 6-high board. Backdoor flush draw? I have Ks, so I have a spade, but need two more spades for flush. Actually board has 6s and 4s, so there are two spades on board. I have Ks, so I have a flush draw: three spades on board plus my Ks gives me a flush draw! Wait: board has 6s and 4s (two spades). I have Ks, so I have a spade. That's a flush draw! I need two more spades on turn and river. Actually, I have a flush draw: I need one more spade to make a flush (since I have one spade, board has two spades,"

Seat 5 has 214 chips. I have 344 chips.\n\nSeat 4's history: they've shown some calling with suited hands (Qs As, Qh Jh, Qd Th). They tend to call preflop and sometimes bet flop. They might have a pair or a draw. Seat 5's history: they've shown aggression on flops (bet 30 in hand 43, bet 48 in hand 44). They have called preflop here. They might have a pair or a draw.\n\nMy preflop raise was to 20 (2.5x BB) from BB after two limpers. That's standard. Both called. I checked flop (standard with overcards and draw). Seat 4 bet 30 (pot-sized relative to preflop pot?). Seat 5 called.\n\nGiven I have a flush draw and overcards, I have good equity. I should consider raising to isolate or build pot. However, Seat 4 is short and all-in likely, so there will be side pot with Seat 5. If I raise, I can put pressure on Seat 5 who might fold marginal hands. But if Seat 5 has a strong hand, they might re-raise. My stack is healthy (43 BB). I could call and see turn, but raising might be better to maximize fold equity and build pot for my draw.\n\nLet's calculate: If I call 30, pot becomes 154 (124+30). If I raise, minimum raise to 60 (total). That's 30 more. Seat 5 would need to call 30 more to continue. They have 214 chips, so they can call. If they fold, I win side pot with Seat 4? Actually, Seat 4 is all-in, so main pot includes Seat 4's bet, side pot between me and Seat 5 if I raise and Seat 5 calls. If Seat 5 folds, I win the entire pot (124 + my call? Wait, if Seat 5 folds to my raise, then pot is 124 (current) + my raise to 60 (I put 60 total, but I already have 0 in? Actually, I haven't acted yet. Pot is 124 including Seat 4's 30 and Seat 5's 30. I need to call 30. If I raise to 60, I put 60 total, which is 30 more than calling. So pot becomes 124 + 30 (my extra) = 154. Seat 5 would need to call 30 more to continue, making pot 184. If Seat 5 folds, I win 154 pot.\n\nBut Seat 4 is all-in, so main pot is 64 (preflop) + 30+30 = 124? Actually, preflop pot was 64. Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, so main pot is 64+30+30=124. That's the pot before my action. If I call, main pot becomes 154. If I raise and Seat 5 folds, main pot is 124 + my 30 = 154, but Seat 4 is all-in, so they can only win the portion they contributed. Actually, side pot rules: main pot includes up to the all-in player's contribution. Seat 4 has 28 chips left? They bet 30, but maybe they have 28 left after betting? The bet size is 30, but if they have only 28, the effective bet is 28. So main pot includes up to 28 from each player. Let's simplify: I have good equity and should continue. Raising could win immediately if Seat 5 folds. But Seat 5 has called flop bet, indicating some strength. They might have a pair, maybe middle pair, or a draw. They might call a raise.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, I have a big stack relative to others (43 BB). Seat 5 has 26.75 BB. I should play aggressively with draws. I'll raise to apply pressure.\n\nLet's decide:"

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called, and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called. Seat 4 has only 28 chips left (after calling 12 preflop? Wait, they have 28 chips now, but they called 12 preflop and then bet 30 on flop? That seems impossible if they only have 28 chips total. Let's examine: Seat 4 started with 28 chips. They called 8 preflop (limped), then I raised to 20, they called 12 more (total 20). That would leave them with 8 chips. Then they bet 30 on flop? That can't be right. Maybe the stack display is current stack after actions? Actually, the stack display is likely current stack after posting blinds/calls. Let's recalc: Seat 4 started with 28 chips. They posted no blind (they're not SB/BB). They called 8 preflop (limped). Then I raised to 20, they called 12 more, total 20 invested. That leaves 8 chips. Then they bet 30 on flop? That's impossible. Maybe the stack display is before the hand? Or maybe they have 28 chips remaining after the flop bet? But they bet 30, which would be more than they have. Hmm.\n\nLet me read again: \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 28 chips\". That's likely their current stack after posting blinds/calls. So they have 28 chips left. They called 12 preflop (total 20). Then on flop they bet 30? That would be all-in if they only have 28 left. Actually, the bet size is 30, but they might be all-in for less. The amount to call is 30, but if Seat 4 has only 28 chips, the effective bet might be 28. However, Seat 5 called 30, so maybe Seat 4 actually has more chips? Let's check the pot size: Pot is 124 chips. Preflop: SB posted 4, BB (me) posted 8, Seat 4 called 8, Seat 5 called 8, I raised 20 (so added 12 more), Seat 4 called 12, Seat 5 called 12. That's 4+8+8+8+12+12+12 = 64? Wait: 4+8=12, +8=20, +8=28, +12=40, +12=52, +12=64. Pot preflop should be 64. But pot is 124 on flop. That includes flop bets: Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, so 64+30+30=124. So Seat 4 indeed bet 30, and Seat 5 called 30. So Seat 4 must have had at least 30 chips after preflop. So maybe the stack display is before the hand started? Let's assume Seat 4 has 28 chips now after betting 30? That would mean they had 58 chips before hand, invested 20 preflop, leaving 38, then bet 30 leaving 8. But display shows 28. Could be a mistake. Let's not overthink; we know Seat 4 is short-stacked (28 chips). They bet 30, which is likely all-in (or close). Seat 5 called 30. So there's a side pot between me and Seat 5 if I call.\n\nMy hand: Qd Ks. Board: 3h 6s 4s. I have overcards, no flush draw (I have Ks, but board has two spades; I have Qd not spade). So I have two overcards (K and Q) to a 6-high board. Backdoor flush draw? I have Ks, so I have a spade, but need two more spades for flush. Actually board has 6s and 4s, so there are two spades on board. I have Ks, so I have a flush draw: three spades on board plus my Ks gives me a flush draw! Wait: board has 6s and 4s (two spades). I have Ks, so I have a spade. That's a flush draw! I need two more spades on turn and river. Actually, I have a flush draw: I need one more spade to make a flush (since I have one spade, board has two spades,",

My equity against likely hands: I have ~30-40% against a pair like 77-TT, and better against draws. However, there are two opponents: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is short-stacked and likely all-in or nearly all-in with their bet of 30 (they have 28 chips). Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called the 30.

          "content": "Now, let's analyze the current hand:\n\nWe're on the turn. Board: 3h 6s 4s 5d. Our hand: Qd Ks.\n\nWe have KQ offsuit. Board is 3-6-4-5 rainbow (no flush draws). The board is very connected with many straight possibilities. The 5d turn completes some straights (2-7, 7-8, 2-6? Actually 2-7 would be a straight with 3-4-5-6-7, and 7-8 would be 4-5-6-7-8).\n\nWe have two overcards (K and Q) but no pair. We have a gutshot straight draw: we need a 7 to complete a straight (3-4-5-6-7). That's 4 outs.\n\nPot is 302 chips. We have 254 chips left. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) went all-in on flop with 28 chips. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 154 chips and called our flop raise.\n\nWe checked flop, Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, we raised to 90 (total), Seat 4 called 28 all-in, Seat 5 called 60 more.\n\nNow on turn, action is on us. Amount to call is 0. We can check or raise.\n\nOur hand is weak: just two overcards and a gutshot. However, we have position (SB but heads-up vs GPT-OSS-120B now that Seat 4 is all-in). Actually, Seat 4 is all-in, so there's a side pot between us and Seat 5.\n\nWe need to consider what hands GPT-OSS-120B could have. He called preflop, called flop bet, called our raise. He could have a pair, a draw, or maybe a made straight.\n\nLooking at his tendencies: From the search, he seems to fold to aggression sometimes. But he called our flop raise, so he has something.\n\nOur flop raise was quite strong (90 into 120 pot?). Let's calculate: Preflop pot was maybe 48? Actually: SB 4, BB 8, Seat 4 call 8, Seat 5 call 8, Seat 1 fold, we raise 20 (total 28?), then Seat 4 call 12, Seat 5 call 12. So preflop pot: 4+8+8+8+20+12+12 = 72? Wait, let's recalc: SB posts 4, BB posts 8, Seat 4 calls 8, Seat 5 calls 8 = 28. Then we raise 20 more (so total we put in 28), Seat 4 calls 12 more (total 20), Seat 5 calls 12 more (total 20). So pot = 4+8+8+8+20+12+12 = 72. Yes.\n\nFlop: We check, Seat 4 bets 30, Seat 5 calls 30, pot now 132. We raise to 90 (total). That's a raise of 60 more (since we need to call 30 then raise). Pot becomes 132+90 = 222? Actually our raise adds 60 to pot, so pot = 132+60 = 192. Then Seat 4 calls 28 all-in, Seat 5 calls 60 more. So pot main pot: 72+30+30+90+28+60 = 310? Let's not overcomplicate.\n\nNow turn: pot is 302 chips. We have 254 left.\n\nIf we check, GPT-OSS-120B might bet. He has 154 chips total. He might bet with a strong hand or a draw.\n\nOur gutshot gives us 4 outs to a straight. That's about 8.7% equity (4/46). But we also have overcard outs: K or Q might be good if he has a smaller pair. But on this board, many pairs are possible: 6x, 5x, 4x, 3x, or overpairs like 77-AA. Our KQ might be ahead if he has a draw like 7x or 8x.\n\nActually, we have 6 outs if we count K and Q as clean (maybe not clean if he has AK or AQ). So maybe 6 outs = 13%. But we need to discount.\n\nGiven the connected board, our hand is marginal. We have position for river if we check now. We can check and evaluate river.\n\nIf we bet, we could try to take it down with a semi-bluff. But we'd be committing chips with weak equity.\n\nLet's think about stack sizes: We have "

          "reasoning_content": "Now, let's analyze the current hand:\n\nWe're on the turn. Board: 3h 6s 4s 5d. Our hand: Qd Ks.\n\nWe have KQ offsuit. Board is 3-6-4-5 rainbow (no flush draws). The board is very connected with many straight possibilities. The 5d turn completes some straights (2-7, 7-8, 2-6? Actually 2-7 would be a straight with 3-4-5-6-7, and 7-8 would be 4-5-6-7-8).\n\nWe have two overcards (K and Q) but no pair. We have a gutshot straight draw: we need a 7 to complete a straight (3-4-5-6-7). That's 4 outs.\n\nPot is 302 chips. We have 254 chips left. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) went all-in on flop with 28 chips. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 154 chips and called our flop raise.\n\nWe checked flop, Seat 4 bet 30, Seat 5 called 30, we raised to 90 (total), Seat 4 called 28 all-in, Seat 5 called 60 more.\n\nNow on turn, action is on us. Amount to call is 0. We can check or raise.\n\nOur hand is weak: just two overcards and a gutshot. However, we have position (SB but heads-up vs GPT-OSS-120B now that Seat 4 is all-in). Actually, Seat 4 is all-in, so there's a side pot between us and Seat 5.\n\nWe need to consider what hands GPT-OSS-120B could have. He called preflop, called flop bet, called our raise. He could have a pair, a draw, or maybe a made straight.\n\nLooking at his tendencies: From the search, he seems to fold to aggression sometimes. But he called our flop raise, so he has something.\n\nOur flop raise was quite strong (90 into 120 pot?). Let's calculate: Preflop pot was maybe 48? Actually: SB 4, BB 8, Seat 4 call 8, Seat 5 call 8, Seat 1 fold, we raise 20 (total 28?), then Seat 4 call 12, Seat 5 call 12. So preflop pot: 4+8+8+8+20+12+12 = 72? Wait, let's recalc: SB posts 4, BB posts 8, Seat 4 calls 8, Seat 5 calls 8 = 28. Then we raise 20 more (so total we put in 28), Seat 4 calls 12 more (total 20), Seat 5 calls 12 more (total 20). So pot = 4+8+8+8+20+12+12 = 72. Yes.\n\nFlop: We check, Seat 4 bets 30, Seat 5 calls 30, pot now 132. We raise to 90 (total). That's a raise of 60 more (since we need to call 30 then raise). Pot becomes 132+90 = 222? Actually our raise adds 60 to pot, so pot = 132+60 = 192. Then Seat 4 calls 28 all-in, Seat 5 calls 60 more. So pot main pot: 72+30+30+90+28+60 = 310? Let's not overcomplicate.\n\nNow turn: pot is 302 chips. We have 254 left.\n\nIf we check, GPT-OSS-120B might bet. He has 154 chips total. He might bet with a strong hand or a draw.\n\nOur gutshot gives us 4 outs to a straight. That's about 8.7% equity (4/46). But we also have overcard outs: K or Q might be good if he has a smaller pair. But on this board, many pairs are possible: 6x, 5x, 4x, 3x, or overpairs like 77-AA. Our KQ might be ahead if he has a draw like 7x or 8x.\n\nActually, we have 6 outs if we count K and Q as clean (maybe not clean if he has AK or AQ). So maybe 6 outs = 13%. But we need to discount.\n\nGiven the connected board, our hand is marginal. We have position for river if we check now. We can check and evaluate river.\n\nIf we bet, we could try to take it down with a semi-bluff. But we'd be committing chips with weak equity.\n\nLet's think about stack sizes: We have ",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to output JSON. Let me think through the decision clearly.\n\nCurrent situation: Turn, board 3h 6s 4s 5d, hand Qd Ks. Pot 302 chips. We have 254 chips left. Opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) has 154 chips. Seat 4 is all-in.\n\nWe can check or raise. No call needed since amount to call is 0.\n\nOur hand: KQo, no pair, gutshot to 7 for straight (3-4-5-6-7). That's 4 outs. Overcards might be good but doubtful on this board.\n\nWe raised flop aggressively. That might have been a semi-bluff or for value? Actually with KQ high on 3-6-4 board, raising was likely a semi-bluff or trying to take it down. Now turn is 5d, completing some straights.\n\nIf we check, opponent might bet with his range. He called flop raise, so he likely has something: maybe a pair, a draw, or a straight. He has only 154 chips left, so if he bets, he might go all-in.\n\nIf we raise now, we'd be committing more chips with weak equity. Minimum raise to 60 (total). But we could also go all-in.\n\nPot odds if we check-call a bet: If opponent bets all-in 154, pot becomes 302+154=456, we need to call 154. That's about 2.96:1 odds, needing ~25% equity. We likely don't have that.\n\nBetter to check and see what opponent does. If he checks behind, we get a free river. If he bets small, we might call if we think we have enough equity. But with only 4 clean outs (7s) and maybe 3 Ks and 3 Qs if they're good (but likely not), we have maybe 10 outs max = ~22% equity. That's close to break-even.\n\nBut tournament considerations: We have 31.8 BB stack. Not desperate. Seat 4 is all-in, so we're already guaranteed some side pot action.\n\nI think checking is best. Then evaluate river. If opponent bets, we can fold unless we improve.\n\nSo action: check.",

I'm in SB, opponent is GPT-OSS-120B with 154 chips. There's no bet to call (amount to call is 0), so I can check or raise.\n\nLet me think about the hand history: preflop I raised from BB (after posting BB) with Qd Ks to 20 total (so raise of 12 more). Two callers: seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) who is now out, and seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). Flop: 3h 6s 4s. I checked, seat 4 bet 30, seat 5 called, I raised to 90 total (so raise of 60 more). Seat 4 called 28 (all-in? stack was 0? Actually seat 4 had 0 chips after call? Wait seat 4 had 0 chips listed at start but they called preflop and flop bet... Actually seat 4 had 0 chips at start of hand? The table shows seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (out). That means they were already out? But they acted preflop and flop... Maybe they went all-in earlier? Let's see: preflop seat 4 call 8, then seat 3 raise 20, seat 4 call 12 (so they put in 20 total). Flop: seat 4 bet 30, seat 5 call 30, seat 3 raise 90, seat 4 call 28. That would be 28 more, total 58? Actually they bet 30, then called 28 more, so total 58. They must have had 58 chips? But they show 0 chips at start. Possibly they were all-in earlier? Anyway seat 4 is now out, so only seat 5 remains.\n\nTurn: I checked, seat 5 checked. River is 4d, board now 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So board pairs the 4. I have Qd Ks, no pair, just king high with queen kicker. However, the board shows 3-4-5-6 with two 4s, so there's a possible straight: 2-3-4-5-6 or 3-4-5-6-7. But the board has 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d, so straight possibilities: 2-3-4-5-6 (needs a 2) or 3-4-5-6-7 (needs a 7). No 2 or 7 on board. So no straight on board. My hand doesn't connect at all; I have king high. The flush possibilities: spades and diamonds. Board has 6s 4s (two spades), and 4d (diamond). I have Qd Ks, so I have king of spades and queen of diamonds. That gives me the second nut spade flush draw? Actually board has two spades, I have Ks, so I have the king-high spade flush draw. But there's no flush on board because only two spades. Diamonds: board has 4d, I have Qd, so only one diamond. No flush.\n\nWhat could opponent have? They called preflop, called flop bet, called my raise on flop, checked turn. They have 154 chips left. They might have a pair, maybe a straight draw, maybe a flush draw. The flop was 3h 6s 4s, so possible hands: pocket pairs, maybe 5x, maybe spade draws. Turn was 5d, completing possible straight if they had 7x or 2x. But they checked turn, so maybe they don't have a straight. River pairs the 4, which could improve some hands like trips if they had a 4, but unlikely.\n\nMy flop raise was large: I raised to 90 after check-raising. That's a strong move representing a strong hand. I have Qd Ks, which is not strong, but I was likely semi-bluffing with overcards and spade draw. Now on river, I have king high. The pot is 302 chips. I have 254 chips left. Opponent has 154 chips left. If I bet, I could try to bluff representing a strong hand like a set or two pair that improved to full house on river? But the river paired the board, so if I had a 4, I now have trips or full house. However, my line:"

I'm in SB, opponent is GPT-OSS-120B with 154 chips. There's no bet to call (amount to call is 0), so I can check or raise.\n\nLet me think about the hand history: preflop I raised from BB (after posting BB) with Qd Ks to 20 total (so raise of 12 more). Two callers: seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) who is now out, and seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). Flop: 3h 6s 4s. I checked, seat 4 bet 30, seat 5 called, I raised to 90 total (so raise of 60 more). Seat 4 called 28 (all-in? stack was 0? Actually seat 4 had 0 chips after call? Wait seat 4 had 0 chips listed at start but they called preflop and flop bet... Actually seat 4 had 0 chips at start of hand? The table shows seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (out). That means they were already out? But they acted preflop and flop... Maybe they went all-in earlier? Let's see: preflop seat 4 call 8, then seat 3 raise 20, seat 4 call 12 (so they put in 20 total). Flop: seat 4 bet 30, seat 5 call 30, seat 3 raise 90, seat 4 call 28. That would be 28 more, total 58? Actually they bet 30, then called 28 more, so total 58. They must have had 58 chips? But they show 0 chips at start. Possibly they were all-in earlier? Anyway seat 4 is now out, so only seat 5 remains.\n\nTurn: I checked, seat 5 checked. River is 4d, board now 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. So board pairs the 4. I have Qd Ks, no pair, just king high with queen kicker. However, the board shows 3-4-5-6 with two 4s, so there's a possible straight: 2-3-4-5-6 or 3-4-5-6-7. But the board has 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d, so straight possibilities: 2-3-4-5-6 (needs a 2) or 3-4-5-6-7 (needs a 7). No 2 or 7 on board. So no straight on board. My hand doesn't connect at all; I have king high. The flush possibilities: spades and diamonds. Board has 6s 4s (two spades), and 4d (diamond). I have Qd Ks, so I have king of spades and queen of diamonds. That gives me the second nut spade flush draw? Actually board has two spades, I have Ks, so I have the king-high spade flush draw. But there's no flush on board because only two spades. Diamonds: board has 4d, I have Qd, so only one diamond. No flush.\n\nWhat could opponent have?

Pot is 302 chips. I have 254 chips. Opponent has 154 chips. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand is weak - just king high. But I raised preflop and check-raised flop, representing strength. The river paired the board, which could have improved my hand if I had a 4 (trips) or a full house if I had a pocket pair. My line looks strong: raise preflop, check-raise flop, check turn (maybe trapping). On river, I could bet to represent a strong hand.\n\nOpponent called flop raise and checked turn. They might have a marginal hand like a pair or a draw that missed. They have 154 chips left, pot is 302. If I bet, I could try to get them to fold.\n\nHowever, if I bet and they call, I lose chips. My hand is literally king high, no pair. The board is low cards with a pair of 4s. They could have a pair of 5s, 6s, or a 4. They called flop raise, so they have something.\n\nLet me consider pot odds: If I bet, say 100 chips (about 1/3 pot), they need to call 100 to win 402 (pot 302 + my bet 100). That's about 4:1 odds. They might call with any pair. If I go all-in (254 chips), they need to call 254 to win 556, about 2.2:1. They'd probably call with any decent hand.\n\nMy image: I've been aggressive. But my hand is weak. Checking seems weak too, but maybe I can get a free showdown with king high. If I check, they might bet with any hand, and I'd have to fold. But they checked turn, so maybe they're weak too.\n\nI should check and hope they check behind. If they bet, I can fold. That seems reasonable. I don't want to bluff into a possible calling station.\n\nBut let me recall opponent tendencies. Use tool.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to make a decision. I'm on the river with king high, board is 3h 6s 4s 5d 4d. I have Qd Ks. The pot is 302 chips. I have 254 chips left, opponent has 154 chips left. I checked turn, opponent checked. Now on river, I have the option to check or raise (bet). Since amount to call is 0, I can check for free.\n\nMy hand is very weak - just king high. However, I raised preflop and check-raised the flop aggressively. That represents strength. The river paired the board with 4d, which could improve some hands but also makes it less likely opponent has a 4 (only one left). My line could represent a hand like AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, or a set that improved to full house. But I actually have KQ offsuit.\n\nOpponent called flop raise and checked turn. They might have a medium pair, a draw that missed, or a weak hand. They have 154 chips left, less than half the pot. If I bet, I could try to bluff them off a better hand. But they only need to call 154 chips to win 302+154=456 pot? Actually if I bet, I need to decide bet size. Minimum raise to is 60, but I can bet any amount up to my stack.\n\nIf I bet, say 100 chips (about 1/3 pot), they need to call 100 to win 402 (302+100). That's about 4:1 odds. They might call with any pair. If I go all-in (254), they need to call 254 to win 556 (302+254). That's about 2.2:1 odds. They might call with any decent hand.\n\nGiven my weak hand, checking seems safer. But I have position (I act first? Actually I'm SB, so I act first on river? Wait, the action shows: turn: Seat 3 check, turn: Seat 5 check. Now river, I'm seat 3 (SB), so I act first. I can check, then opponent can bet. If I check and opponent bets, I'll have to decide whether to call. But opponent checked turn, so they might not bet river either.\n\nChecking seems reasonable: I have a weak hand, I've shown aggression earlier, but I might get a free showdown. If opponent bets, I can fold. If opponent checks behind, I might win if they have worse. But king high is not likely to win at showdown.\n\nHowever, given my aggressive line, I could try a bluff bet on river. The board is scary: straight and flush draws missed, board paired. I could represent a full house or trips. But opponent called flop raise, so they might have something. They have only 154 chips left, so they might be pot-committed if they call.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 254 chips (31.8 BB). That's a decent stack. Opponent has 154 chips (19.25 BB). If I bluff and get called, I lose significant chips. If I check and lose, I still have 254 chips. If I bluff and succeed, I win 302 chips, increasing to 556 chips (69.5 BB) which would be huge.\n\nBut the risk is high. My hand is king high, which might actually be good if opponent has nothing. They might have missed draws like spade flush draw, straight draw. The board has 4d, which pairs the board, but doesn't complete any obvious draws.\n\nI'll check and hope they check behind.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this hand. I'm on the button with 4d8d. My stack is 250 chips (31.2 BB). Blinds are 4/8. Pot is 230 chips. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 218, which is an all-in since they have 0 chips? Wait, Seat 5 has 0 chips and is marked as \"out\". That seems odd. Maybe they're already out of the tournament? Actually, looking at the players: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). So they're out of the tournament, but somehow they raised? That doesn't make sense. Perhaps it's a mistake in the display. Let me read carefully: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out)\". Yet the action says \"Seat 5 raise 218\". That seems contradictory. Maybe they had 218 chips and went all-in? But it says 0 chips. Hmm.\n\nAnyway, the pot is 230 chips. Seat 1 folded. I'm Seat 3 (button). I posted SB 4, Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted BB 8. Then Seat 5 raised to 218. I need to call 214 to win a pot of 230 + 218 = 448? Wait, let's calculate: Pot before Seat 5's raise: SB 4 + BB 8 = 12. Seat 5 raised to 218 total, which means they added 210 more (since BB is 8, they need to raise at least to 16, but they raised huge). The pot after their raise: 4 (SB) + 8 (BB) + 218 = 230. That matches the pot listed: 230 chips. So I need to call 214 (since I already put in 4 as SB). If I call, I put in 214 more, making total pot 230 + 214 = 444. But actually, Seat 4 (BB) still hasn't acted. They will act after me. They have 226 chips. They could call or fold.\n\nMy hand: 4d8d suited. Very weak hand. Facing a huge raise that looks like an all-in (though Seat 5 has 0 chips? Maybe they're all-in with 218 and have 0 left). The raise is 27.25 BB (218/8). That's a massive raise, typically indicating a very strong hand. With 4d8d, I should almost certainly fold. However, I need to consider pot odds. I need to call 214 to win 230. That's about 1.07:1 odds, meaning I need about 48% equity. 4d8s vs a strong range has maybe 30% equity at best. So fold.\n\nBut wait, there's also Seat 4 behind me who could call or raise. If I call, they might also call or raise. That could change pot odds. However, with such a weak hand, I should fold.\n\nI should also consider tournament situation: I have 250 chips (31.2 BB). That's healthy. No need to gamble with 4d8d.\n\nLet me check if there's any history on Seat 5's behavior. Use recall_opponent_actions for Seat 5.",

Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 218, which is effectively an all-in since they have 0 chips? Wait, Seat 5 shows 0 chips and is marked as \"out\" in the player list. But the action says Seat 5 raise 218. That seems contradictory. Let me check the player list again: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). Yet the action says \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 218\". That would be impossible if they have 0 chips. Maybe it's a misprint or they had chips earlier? The pot is 230 chips, which suggests SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 218 = 230. So indeed Seat 5 raised 218 total.\n\nBut Seat 5 is shown as having 0 chips and \"out\". Perhaps they went all-in on a previous hand and lost, but this is a new hand? Or maybe the \"out\" means they're sitting out? Let me re-read: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out)\". Could mean they're out of the tournament, but then they wouldn't be able to raise. Possibly a display error.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide: fold or call with 4d8d. I have to call 214 chips to win a pot of 230 + my call 214 = 444 total. So I'm getting about 2.07:1 pot odds (444/214). My stack is 250, calling 214 leaves me with 36 chips if I lose. That's desperate.\n\nHand strength: 4d8d suited is a weak hand. Against a huge raise like this, likely a strong hand. Could be a pair, high cards, maybe AK, AQ, JJ+, etc. My equity against a reasonable range is poor.\n\nTournament situation: I have 31.2 BB, which is okay but not deep. Losing this would cripple me to 4.5 BB. However, doubling up would give me 500 chips (62.5 BB). Risk vs reward.\n\nBut wait, Seat 5 has 0 chips? That's confusing. If they actually have 0 chips, their raise is invalid. Maybe they have 218 chips but display shows 0? Let me search for observations about Seat 5.\n\nI should use the search tool to see if there are any hands involving Seat 5.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this hand situation. I'm on the button with 4d8d, which is a weak hand. There's been a raise from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) who raised to 218 chips, which is effectively all-in since they have 0 chips? Wait, the table shows GPT-OSS-120B has 0 chips and is marked as \"out\". That seems confusing. Let me re-read: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). But the actions say \"Seat 5 raise 218\". That doesn't make sense if they have 0 chips. Maybe it's a misprint or they're actually all-in? \n\nActually, looking at the pot: it's 230 chips. Blinds are 4/8. I posted SB 4, Seat 4 posted BB 8. That's 12 chips. Then Seat 5 raised 218, making total pot 230. So Seat 5 must have had at least 218 chips. But the table says 0 chips. This is inconsistent.\n\nRegardless, I need to make a decision. I have 250 chips total, 31.2 BB. Amount to call is 214 chips, which would leave me with only 36 chips if I call. That's a huge portion of my stack - about 85% of it.\n\nMy hand is 4d8d suited, which is very weak. Even suited connectors need better odds to call. The pot odds: I need to call 214 to win 230 + 214 = 444? Actually, pot is 230, I call 214, total pot would be 444. So I'm getting about 1:1 odds (214 to win 230, actually 214 to win 230? Wait, pot is 230 now, I call 214, pot becomes 444, my share is 214/444 = 48%. I need about 48% equity to break even.\n\nWith 4d8d against a likely strong raising range, I have nowhere near 48% equity. Even against a wide range, 4d8s is around 30-35% equity at best. Against a tight range, it's worse.\n\nPosition: I'm on the button, which is good, but I'm facing a huge raise that commits most of my stack. If I call, I'll be playing for my tournament life with a weak hand.\n\nTournament considerations: With 31.2 BB, I have a decent stack. Folding leaves me with 250 chips (31.2 BB). Calling and losing would leave me with 36 chips (4.5 BB) and basically crippled.\n\nI should check opponent tendencies, but the tool calls are failing due to format issues. However, even without that information, this is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, the price is too high, and I'd be risking most of my stack with poor equity.\n\nLet me think about the raise size: 218 into a 12 chip pot is a massive overbet. This suggests either a very strong hand or a bluff. But with my weak holding, I can't afford to find out.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop situation. I'm on the button with 5h8h, which is a suited connector but weak. Stack is 250 chips (31.2 BB). Blinds are 4/8. Only SB (MiniMax-M2, 222 chips) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B, 222 chips) are left to act after me. UTG folded.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has been mostly calling preflop (calls 4-8 chips), folded twice when facing larger bets. In hand 45, called 8 then 12 preflop, then bet 30 on flop.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): More aggressive. In hand 46, raised to 218 preflop (all-in). Also bets postflop.\n\nMy hand 5h8h is weak but suited and connected. On button, I have position advantage. However, with only 31.2 BB, I should be careful. Suited connectors can play well postflop but need good pot odds.\n\nPot is 12 chips (4+8). I need to call 8 to see flop. That's getting 1.5:1 pot odds. If I call, SB may complete (call additional 4) or raise. BB may check or raise.\n\nGiven my position and stack size, folding is reasonable with such a weak hand. However, suited connectors can make strong draws. But with shallow stacks, implied odds aren't great.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I've been playing somewhat aggressively (raised with QhJh, Kd4d, QdKs). Lost some chips. Need to preserve stack.\n\nBetter to fold this weak hand and wait for better spots. 5h8h is bottom of my range even on button with shallow stacks.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

The pot is 12 chips (SB+BB). Minimum raise is to 16 chips (double the BB).\n\nWith AA, I want to get value but also not scare everyone away. A standard raise would be 3-4x BB, so 24-32 chips. However, given the aggressive tendencies I've seen (especially from GPT-OSS-120B who made a huge 218-chip raise recently), I might consider a larger raise to isolate or build a big pot.\n\nBut I'm in UTG, so there are many players left to act. A standard raise of 24-28 chips seems appropriate. If I raise too small, I might get too many callers. If I raise too big, I might only get the blinds or get 3-bet by someone with a strong hand.\n\nLet me think about stack sizes:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB): 252 chips\n- MiniMax-M2: 218 chips  \n- GPT-OSS-120B (SB): 234 chips\n\nAll stacks are similar to mine. A raise to 24-28 chips (3-3.5x) would be about 10% of my stack, leaving room for post-flop play.\n\nGiven that I have the best possible starting hand, I should raise to build the pot.

I should bet for value with my pocket Aces. The board has draws (flush draw, straight draws) and possible trips (Jx). A bet protects my hand and gets value from weaker holdings.\n\nStandard bet sizing would be 40-50 chips (60-75% of pot). I'll go with 48 chips, which is about 70% of pot. This is a reasonable continuation bet after my preflop raise.\n\nMy action is \"raise\" since I'm making the first bet on the flop. The \"raise_to\" should be the total amount I'm putting in. I already have 8 chips in from the BB, plus I raised preflop to 28 total. Wait, I need to think about the current pot and my contribution.\n\nActually, looking at the hand history: I'm in BB (Seat 3). Preflop: Seat 5 posted SB 4, Seat 1 posted BB 8, I raised to 28 from BB, Seat 4 called 28, others folded.\n\nSo I have 28 chips in the pot already (my preflop raise). The pot is 68 chips total. Now on the flop, I'm first to act. If I bet, I need to specify the total amount I want to put in. Since I have 28 chips in already, if I want to bet 48 chips total, that means I need to add 20 more chips (48 - 28 = 20). But actually, when betting on a new street, we usually think of the bet amount as additional chips beyond what's already in.\n\nBut the instructions say: \"If raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount).\" So if I want to bet 48 chips total, I should set raise_to: 48.\n\nWait, but I already have 28 chips in. So to get to 48 total, I'd be adding 20 more. That seems like a small bet relative to the pot (20 into 68 = ~30% pot). That might be too small.\n\nLet me recalculate: Pot is 68 chips. If I bet 48 chips as a total amount, that means I'm adding 20 chips to my existing 28. That's a 20 chip bet into 68 pot = 29% pot. That's on the small side.\n\nMaybe I should think in terms of bet size relative to pot. A standard continuation bet is 50-75% of pot. 50% of 68 = 34 chips. 75% = 51 chips. So I should be adding 34-51 chips beyond my existing 28.\n\nIf I want to bet 50% pot, I'd put in 28 + 34 = 62 total. If I want 75% pot, I'd put in 28 + 51 = 79 total.\n\nI have 222 chips total. Betting 62 total (adding 34) leaves me with 188. Betting 79 total (adding 51) leaves me with 171. Both are reasonable.\n\nI'll go with a 75% pot bet, which is 79 chips total. That's aggressive but appropriate with Aces on this board.\n\nActually wait, I need to check the minimum raise. The prompt says \"Minimum raise to: 20\". That means the smallest bet I can make is 20 chips total? Or 20 chips more than whatever is currently in?\n\nThe instructions: \"Minimum raise to: 20\" likely means the total amount I need to raise to is at least 20. Since I already have 28 in, I can't bet less than 20 total, which would mean I'd have to remove chips. That doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, in poker, when you're first to act on a new street, the minimum bet is usually the big blind (8 chips here). But there might be specific tournament rules. Given \"Minimum raise to: 20\", I think that means if I want to raise (bet), the total amount must be at least 20 chips. Since I have 28 already in, I need to bet at least 20 total, which I already exceed. So I can bet any amount from 20 up.\n\nI'll bet 79 chips total (adding 51 more). That's a strong continuation bet.\n\nReasoning: With pocket Aces on Kd Jh Jd board, need to bet for value and protection. Many hands that called preflop (KQ, QJ, JT, flush draws) will call this bet. Also charges draws appropriately. Sizing at 75% pot is standard for continuation bets.\n\nLet me provide the JSON.",

I have pocket Aces on a Kd Jh Jd board. I want to bet for value. Since there's no bet to call, I should use \"raise\" to make a bet. The \"raise_to\" should be the total amount I'm putting in. Currently I have 222 chips. If I want to bet 48 chips, that means my total bet would be 48 chips (since there's nothing in there yet from me on this street). Actually wait, I'm the big blind and I already put in 28 chips preflop. On the flop, I haven't put anything yet. So if I bet 48 chips, that means I'm adding 48 chips to the pot, making my total contribution to the pot 28 + 48 = 76 chips. But the \"raise_to\" field should be the total amount I'm putting in for this street. Since I haven't put anything on the flop yet, \"raise_to\" should be 48.\n\nBut let me think about the rules: \"If raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\". For a bet on the flop when facing no bet, the total amount I'm putting in would be the bet size. So yes, raise_to: 48.\n\nActually, I should consider pot size and stack sizes more carefully. Pot is 68 chips. My stack is 222 chips. A bet of 48 chips is about 70% of pot. That seems reasonable. Could also go smaller like 40 chips or larger like 55 chips. 48 is fine.\n\nReasoning should be brief explanation.\n\nSo final JSON: {\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 48,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Betting for value with pocket Aces on Kd Jh Jd board. Need to charge draws (flush and straight) and get value from Kx hands. 48 chips (~70% pot) is a good sizing to achieve both objectives.\"\n}\n\nWait, should I check instead? No, with Aces I should bet. Could check-raise? But I'm out of position (BB) and opponent is in position relative to me. Actually, I'm BB and opponent is... let me check positions. Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2. I'm Seat 3 (BB). So I acted first preflop, and now I'm first to act on flop. I'm out of position. That makes betting even more important to control the pot and not give free cards.\n\nYes, betting is correct.",

          "content": "I need to analyze this situation carefully. I'm in the BB with Kd Jh facing a raise from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) to 24 total (16 more to call). The pot is currently 36 chips (8 BB + 4 SB + 24 raise).\n\nLooking at opponent data: Seat 5 has shown some aggression recently. In hand #47, they raised to 24 from an earlier position. In hand #46, they went all-in for 218. They also called with pocket 8s in hand #45 and showed down. They seem to be playing a mix of hands.\n\nMy hand: KJo is decent but not great, especially out of position. However, I'm getting good pot odds: 16 to call into a pot of 52 (36 current + 16 my call), which is about 3.25:1. That's reasonable.\n\nMy stack is 282 chips (35.2 BB), which is healthy. Seat 5 has 210 chips (26.25 BB). I have position disadvantage being OOP, but I could consider a 3-bet to take initiative.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold - KJo OOP isn't great, but pot odds are good\n2. Call - See a flop with decent odds, but play OOP\n3. Raise - 3-bet to apply pressure, potentially take it down preflop\n\nIf I raise, minimum is 40 total (32 more). That would be a raise to 2.5x their raise, which is reasonable.\n\nConsidering opponent tendencies: They've shown they can fold (many folds in early hands), but also can be aggressive. They might fold to a 3-bet with marginal hands.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack and don't want to risk too much unnecessarily, but accumulating chips is important.\n\nI think a 3-bet could be good here. KJo has decent equity against their raising range, and a 3-bet might get them to fold many hands that have me dominated (like KQ, AJ, etc.). If they call, I have position on flop (actually wait, I'm BB, they're button? Let me check: Seat 5 is button? Actually positions: Seat 1 was SB, Seat 3 is me BB, Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 raised. So Seat 5 is cutoff or button? Need to check seating: Seat 1, 2, 3 (me), 4, 5. With 5 players, positions would be: SB (seat 1), BB (me seat 3), UTG (seat 4), MP (seat 5). Actually wait, that doesn't make sense with only 5 players. Let me think: Seat 1 folded (was SB), Seat 2 folded, Seat 3 is me (BB), Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 raised. So Seat 5 is on the button! Yes, with 5 players: SB (1), BB (3), UTG (4), MP (5), BTN (5 actually no...). Actually with 5 players: SB, BB, UTG, MP, BTN. Seat 4 was UTG, Seat 5 is MP. So I'm OOP against MP.\n\nGiven I'm OOP, that makes calling less attractive. A 3-bet could take control.\n\nI'll 3-bet to about 60-70 total. Let's do 64 total (raise to 56 more, making it 64 total). That's 2.67x their raise. Reasonable sizing.\n\nIf they 4-bet, I can fold. If they call, I can c-bet on favorable flops.\n\nActually, let me check my stack: 282 chips. Raising to 64 leaves me 218 behind. That's reasonable.\n\nDecision: 3-bet to 64."

Even if called, position allows us to play postflop well with initiative.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the button (BTN) with 8h7d. This is a suited connector (8\u26657\u2666 - actually offsuit, not suited). I have 314 chips (39.2 BB). The blinds are 4/8. I posted the small blind of 4, and MiniMax-M2 posted the big blind of 8. Everyone else folded.\n\nI need to call 4 chips to complete the bet (since I already posted 4 as SB, and the BB is 8, so I need to add 4 more).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB) has 182 chips. From the data, I see they tend to call preflop often but haven't shown any raises preflop. They've folded to raises several times. They seem somewhat passive.\n\nMy hand: 8h7d is a weak hand, but being on the button with only the BB to act behind me gives me positional advantage. This is a classic steal opportunity.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 12 chips (my 4 SB + BB's 8). That's 3:1 pot odds (25% equity needed). Even with 87o, I have decent equity against a random BB hand.\n\nHowever, I could also raise to try to steal the blinds. The minimum raise is to 16 total (8 more than the current bet of 8). My stack is healthy at 39.2 BB.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack, but not huge. Stealing blinds is important in tournament poker.\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 seems passive and hasn't raised preflop, a raise might take it down immediately. Even if called, I have position.\n\nBut 87o is quite weak. Let me think about standard button opening ranges. 87o is borderline - it's not great, but with position and against a likely weak BB range, it might be profitable.\n\nActually, looking at my own history: In hand #47, I folded 85h on the button in a similar situation. That was a slightly weaker hand (85s vs 87o). But position is valuable.\n\nI think the best play is to raise. If I just call, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position postflop (well actually I'm on button, so I have position). Wait, no - if I call, I'll be in position against the BB. That's good.\n\nBut raising has benefits: 1) Might win immediately, 2) Builds pot when I hit, 3) Takes initiative.\n\nI'll make a standard button raise. Let's say raise to 20-24 chips (2.5-3x BB). That's 16-20 more chips.\n\nActually, the minimum raise is to 16 total (double the BB). I could min-raise to 16, but that might not get enough folds. Better to raise to 20 or 24.\n\nI'll raise to 20 total (12 more chips). That's 2.5x BB.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 20,\n  \"reasoning\": \"On button with 87o against passive BB who hasn't shown preflop raises.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm on the button with A3 suited (clubs). This is a decent hand from the button - ace-rag suited has some potential for flushes and ace-high can win if no one has a better ace. I have 40.8 BB, which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 4/8. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted the small blind (4) and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted the big blind (8). Seat 1 folded. \n\nSo there are two players left to act: MiniMax-M2 (SB, 178 chips) and GPT-OSS-120B (BB, 202 chips). I'm on the button, which is the best position. \n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's actions: they seem to call sometimes preflop but also fold often. They called 28 chips with my AA hand (hand 48), then folded on the flop. They've folded the last few hands.\n\nThe pot is 12 chips (4+8). I need to call 8 to see the flop. With A3s, I could consider raising to take initiative and potentially win the blinds, or just call to see a flop cheaply. \n\nFrom the button, raising is standard with many hands, but A3s is marginal. However, with only the blinds left to act and my position advantage, a raise could be good. If I raise to say 24 (3x BB), that would be 24 total (16 more). That's reasonable with my stack.\n\nBut let me consider tournament implications: I have 40.8 BB, which is comfortable. The blinds have 22.25 BB and 25.25 BB respectively. They might be more cautious with their shorter stacks.\n\nActually, looking at my recent history: I've been raising from button with various hands (hand 50: 87o, hand 49: KJ, hand 48: AA). So I have an aggressive image.\n\nGiven that I have position and A3s has some potential, I think a small raise is reasonable. I'll raise to 24 (3x). This puts pressure on the blinds and allows me to potentially win the pot preflop or play postflop in position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A3s from button with position advantage.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm UTG (under the gun) with 7c 4d - a very weak hand. This is an offsuit, disconnected low cards - one of the worst starting hands in poker. I have 338 chips (42.2 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, seat 1): Has folded 10 consecutive times preflop. Seems very tight/passive.\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4): Has folded frequently but also called some raises. Showed aggression once with a bet on flop.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (SB, seat 5): Has been aggressive with raises preflop (hands 46, 47, 49), but folded recently in last 3 hands.\n\nPosition considerations: I'm UTG, which is the worst position. I have to act first after the flop, which makes playing weak hands difficult.\n\nMy hand: 7c 4d is terrible. It has no straight potential, no flush potential (offsuit), low cards that rarely make top pair. Even if I hit a pair, it's likely to be dominated.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 8 into a pot of 12 (20 after my call). That's 2.5:1 pot odds, but with such a weak hand and bad position, implied odds are poor.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (42.2 BB). No need to gamble with trash hands from early position.\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies, if I limp (call), I expect:\n- SB (GPT-OSS-120B) might raise, as they've shown aggression\n- BB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding constantly, but might check with any hand since they get to see a free flop\n\nBut even if it checks through, I'm playing 7-4 offsuit out of position against 3 opponents. This is a losing proposition.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for better spots. I'm chip leader at the table (338 vs others: 240, 178, 198). I can afford to be selective.\n\nDecision: Fold. This hand is unplayable from UTG.",

Offsuit with low cards, not connected, no straight potential. One of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n2. **Position:** We're out of position (BB vs single raiser). This makes playing postflop difficult.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has been raising preflop in some hands (hands 46, 47, 49) but also folding many hands recently (hands 48, 50, 51, 52). The recent pattern shows 4 consecutive folds preflop. The raise to 20 (2.5x) is a standard opening size.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** We need to call 12 to win 32, giving us 2.67:1 pot odds (27% equity needed). With J2o, we have ~32% equity against a typical opening range. However, this assumes we see all 5 cards, but we'll be out of position postflop.\n\n5. **Stack Sizes:** We have 330 chips (41 BB), opponent has 178 (22 BB). If we call and miss the flop, we'll face a continuation bet and likely have to fold. If we hit top pair with J, it's vulnerable.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** We have a healthy stack (41 BB). No need to gamble with weak hands. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n7. **Alternatives:** Raising is possible but would be a bluff with a terrible hand. Folding is the standard play.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. J2o is too weak to defend from the big blind against a single raise, especially out of position. The pot odds are decent but the hand has poor playability postflop. Better to wait for a better spot with our healthy stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"J2o is too weak to defend from BB against a single raise.

The other players folded. I need to call 4 chips to complete the blind, or I can raise to at least 16 chips total.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 seems fairly passive preflop. From the data, they've mostly folded or called, never raised preflop. They've called raises several times (hand 47, 48, 52) but tend to fold postflop if they don't hit. They have 182 chips (22.75 BB).\n\nWith pocket kings, this is an extremely strong hand preflop. I'm on the button with position advantage. The pot is currently 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8).\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Pocket kings is the second-best starting hand (only behind aces)\n2. I have position on the BB\n3. Opponent appears passive preflop\n4. I want to build the pot with this strong hand\n5. My stack is 326 vs opponent's 182\n\nI should definitely raise. The minimum raise is to 16 total (8 more). But with such a strong hand, I should make a larger raise to build the pot and potentially get all-in preflop against a weaker hand. Given the stacks, I could raise to around 24-32 chips (3-4x BB). This would be a standard raise size and put pressure on the BB.\n\nIf I raise to 24 total (20 more), that's 2.5x the BB. That seems reasonable. If opponent calls, the pot will be 44 chips going to the flop, and I'll have position.\n\nLet's raise to 24.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this preflop situation. I'm on the button with 9s Th (9 of spades, 10 of hearts). This is a suited connector, but not a great one - it's 9-10 offsuit actually (since 9s and Th are different suits). So it's 9-10 offsuit, which is a marginal hand.\n\nMy stack is 338 chips (42.2 BB), which is healthy. The blinds are 4/8, so I have to call 8 chips to see the flop.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is the small blind. They've been folding a lot preflop (6/10 times), calling twice, and once they called 8 and then bet 8 on flop. They seem somewhat tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is the big blind. They've been raising preflop frequently (4/10 times raised, including one all-in for 218), and folding other times. They seem aggressive.\n\nThe action: Seat 1 (UTG) folded, so it's folded to me on the button. I'm in late position with only the blinds left to act. This is a good stealing opportunity.\n\nWith 9-10 offsuit, it's not a premium hand, but from the button with folds in front, I have good position. The pot is 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8). Calling 8 gives me 1.5:1 pot odds, but more importantly, I have position advantage.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I have a healthy stack, and stealing blinds can be profitable. However, 9-10 offsuit is weak and doesn't play well postflop. A raise might be better to try to take it down preflop.\n\nLooking at the BB's tendencies: they've raised preflop 4 times out of 10, so they're aggressive. If I just call, they might raise behind me. If I raise, they might call or re-raise.\n\nActually, let me check my own recent history: I've been raising from late positions and winning pots preflop (hand #50, 51, 54). This suggests my table image might be aggressive.\n\nGiven my position and the fact that it's folded to me, a raise is standard here. The minimum raise is to 16 total (8 more). I could raise to 20-24 (2.5-3x BB).\n\nHowever, 9-10 offsuit is quite weak. Maybe a fold is better? But folding from the button with only blinds left seems too tight. At least calling to see a flop in position might be okay.\n\nActually, let me think about hand strength: 9-10 offsuit has some straight potential but is otherwise weak. It's easily dominated by better tens or nines. In tournament poker, preserving chips is important.\n\nBut I have position and a chance to steal. A small raise to 20-24 might work. If called, I can play cautiously postflop.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors: The SB has 178 chips (22.25 BB), BB has 202 chips (25.25 BB). They're both shorter than me, which might make them more willing to defend.\n\nDecision: I'll raise to try to steal the blinds. A standard 2.5x raise to 20 total (12 more). If called, I'll have position and can evaluate the flop.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 20,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Button position with folds ahead. 9-10 offsuit is marginal but raising to 20 (2.5x) attempts to steal blinds.

However, I'm getting decent pot odds: need to call 12 to win 32, which is 2.67:1 odds (27% equity needed).\n\nBut there are tournament considerations:\n- I have a healthy stack (42.8 BB)\n- Opponent has 174 chips (21.75 BB)\n- I'm out of position (BB vs CO)\n- 87o doesn't play well out of position\n\nLooking at my recent hands, I've been playing fairly tight, folding marginal hands preflop. This is a borderline spot. The opponent's raise sizing (2.5x) is standard, and given their fold-heavy tendency, they might have a decent but not premium hand.\n\nGiven that I'm out of position with a weak hand, and the opponent has shown some aggression (one previous raise), I think folding is correct here. The pot odds are tempting, but playing 87o out of position against a likely decent range is not optimal.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.",

The action:\n- I posted SB 4\n- MiniMax-M2 posted BB 8\n- GPT-OSS-120B raised to 24 from early position (Seat 5)\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking folded\n- Now it's on me\n\nPot is 36 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24). I need to call 20 chips.\n\nFrom opponent history:\n- GPT-OSS-120B has raised twice in recent hands (Hand 53 and 57), both to 20. This time raised to 24. Seems to be raising with a wider range.\n- MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot preflop (4 of last 5 hands).\n- I'm in position with 42BB stack, which is healthy.\n\nMy hand: K2 offsuit is weak. King-high with poor kicker. However, being on the button gives me positional advantage. If I call, MiniMax-M2 in BB might fold given their recent folding tendency.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 20 to win 36, so pot odds are 20:36 or 1:1.8, meaning I need ~35.7% equity. K2o vs a typical raising range has maybe 30% equity at best. But with position and potential to steal postflop if checked to me, it could be playable.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 42BB, which is a decent stack. GPT-OSS-120B has 182 chips (22.75BB). If I call and MiniMax-M2 folds, pot will be 56 chips and I'll have position on the raiser.\n\nHowever, K2o is really weak. Even with position, it's hard to play postflop without hitting something. And if MiniMax-M2 wakes up with a hand, I could be in trouble.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I've been raising with decent hands (KK, T9s) and folding weak ones. This fits the weak category.\n\nGiven the pot odds and position, some might consider a speculative call, but K2o is just too weak. The raiser could have a real hand, and I'll be out of position if MiniMax-M2 calls.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. My stack is healthy at 42BB, no need to gamble with such a weak hand.\n\nI should fold.",

The pot is 36 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24). I need to call 20 more chips.\n\nLooking at opponent's recent actions: In hand 57 (previous hand), they raised to 20 preflop. In hand 53, they raised to 20 preflop. They seem to be raising from late position occasionally. They've shown down some decent hands: KcAd (AK), KsQs (KQs), AdTs (ATs), 8h8c (pocket 8s). They're not overly loose but have shown some aggression.\n\nMy hand K2o is weak. King high with a weak kicker. On the button, I have position advantage, but K2o is a fold in most situations against a raise. The pot odds: I need to call 20 to win 56 (36 current + my 20). That's about 36% pot odds. K2o against a typical raising range has much less than 36% equity.\n\nMy stack is 338 chips (42 BB), which is healthy. Seat 5 has 182 chips (22.75 BB). They're shorter stacked. Folding preserves my stack. Calling with K2o out of position would be speculative at best. Even with position, K2o doesn't play well postflop unless I hit a strong hand.\n\nGiven the opponent's shown decent hands when they've shown down, and my weak holding, folding is correct.

Shows some showdown hands with decent cards (QQ, TT, AQs). Seems relatively tight.\n2. **Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)**: Also folds a lot preflop (10 of last 10 hands). Showdown hands include some marginal ones (8h2h, AdTs).\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- Q7o is a weak hand, especially from early position, but I'm on the button which is the best position\n- With both blinds already in, they have already invested chips\n- The pot is 12 chips, and it costs me 8 to call (pot odds: 12:8 = 1.5:1, or 40% equity needed)\n- With position, I can play postflop well\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (42 BB)\n- The blinds are small relative to my stack\n- Both opponents seem tight based on recent history\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven my position (button) and the fact that both blinds seem tight (folding a lot), this is a good spot to raise and try to steal the blinds. Q7o is not great, but with position and tight opponents, a raise could work.\n\nHowever, a raise commits more chips. Let me think about the alternatives:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight given my position and opponent tendencies\n2. **Call**: Gets me in cheap with position, but Q7o plays poorly multi-way\n3. **Raise**: Best option to take initiative and potentially win the pot preflop\n\nI should raise to 20-24 chips (2.5-3x BB). This is a standard raise size that pressures the blinds.\n\nLet me check if there's any history of these players defending blinds aggressively. From the data, both fold a lot, so they likely won't defend often."

Shows some showdown hands with decent cards (QQ, TT, AQs). Seems relatively tight.\n2. **Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)**: Also folds a lot preflop (10 of last 10 hands). Showdown hands include some marginal ones (8h2h, AdTs).\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- Q7o is a weak hand, especially from early position, but I'm on the button which is the best position\n- With both blinds already in, they have already invested chips\n- The pot is 12 chips, and it costs me 8 to call (pot odds: 12:8 = 1.5:1, or 40% equity needed)\n- With position, I can play postflop well\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (42 BB)\n- The blinds are small relative to my stack\n- Both opponents seem tight based on recent history\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven my position (button) and the fact that both blinds seem tight (folding a lot), this is a good spot to raise and try to steal the blinds. Q7o is not great, but with position and tight opponents, a raise could work.\n\nHowever, a raise commits more chips. Let me think about the alternatives:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight given my position and opponent tendencies\n2. **Call**: Gets me in cheap with position, but Q7o plays poorly multi-way\n3. **Raise**: Best option to take initiative and potentially win the pot preflop\n\nI should raise to 20-24 chips (2.5-3x BB). This is a standard raise size that pressures the blinds.\n\nLet me check if there's any history of these players defending blinds aggressively. From the data, both fold a lot, so they likely won't defend often.",

Wait, let me recalculate:\n  - SB posted 4\n  - BB posted 8\n  - I raised to 20\n  - MiniMax raised to 32 (so he put in 28 more on top of his SB 4)\n  - BB folded (so his 8 is in the pot)\n  - Total pot: 4(SB) + 8(BB) + 20(my raise) + 28(MiniMax's additional) = 60 chips (matches display)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Q7o is a weak hand, especially offsuit\n- I'm facing a 3-bet from the small blind\n- My initial raise was a standard button steal attempt\n- The 3-bet suggests MiniMax has a stronger hand\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall, MiniMax-M2 has raised preflop 9 times in past hands. Looking at the amounts:\n- Mostly small raises (4, 8 chips)\n- One larger raise of 48 chips (hand #21)\n- One raise of 28 chips (hand #27) similar to this situation\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- I need to call 12 chips\n- Pot will be 60 + 12 = 72 chips if I call\n- Pot odds: 12 / 72 = 16.7%\n- I need ~17% equity to call\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\n- My stack: 318 chips\n- MiniMax stack: 170 chips (he's shorter)\n- Effective stack if I call: 170 chips (MiniMax's stack)\n\n**Position:**\n- I have position on MiniMax (he's SB, I'm BTN)\n- This is advantageous postflop\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (39.8 BB)\n- MiniMax is shorter (21.25 BB)\n- Folding preserves my stack\n- Calling could lead to difficult postflop decisions with a weak hand\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Q7o has very poor equity against a 3-betting range\n2. Even with position, this hand plays poorly postflop\n3. The pot odds (17%) might be close if MiniMax is 3-betting light, but Q7o likely has less than 17% equity against a reasonable 3-bet range\n4. My initial raise was a steal attempt that got 3-bet - time to let it go\n5. Better to preserve chips for better spots\n\n**Conclusion:** Fold. The hand is too weak to continue against a 3-bet, even with position and favorable pot odds. The risk of getting stacked with a weak hand outweighs the potential reward.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q7o is too weak to continue against a 3-bet from SB.

My stack is 318 chips (39.8 BB), which is healthy but not huge. The blinds are 4/8.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, seat 1, 200 chips): Has been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 recent actions were folds). Only once checked BB and then bet on flop. Seems tight.\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, 230 chips): Mostly folding, but raised last hand to 32. Could be getting more aggressive.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (SB, seat 5, 206 chips): Has raised preflop 3 times in recent hands (20, 20, 24). Shows some aggression from late position.\n\nI'm first to act UTG. With AKo, I should definitely raise. The standard play is to raise 3-4x BB. Given I'm UTG and there are 3 players behind me who could have position on me, I should raise a bit larger than usual - maybe 4x BB.\n\nMinimum raise is to 16 (double the BB). I should raise to around 24-32 chips (3-4x BB). Given my stack size and position, I'll raise to 28 chips (3.5x BB).\n\nThis is a strong hand that plays well even if called, and I want to build the pot with it. I also want to thin the field since I'm out of position. A raise here will likely get folds from the tight players, and I might take it down preflop or go heads-up.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific observations about how opponents react to UTG raises."

The amount to call is 172 more (since I already put in 8 as BB? Wait, I'm Seat 3, I posted BB? Actually Seat 1 posted BB 8. I'm Seat 3, I raised from BB? No, I'm Seat 3, which is BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". So I'm the BB. Seat 1 is UTG? Actually Seat 1 posted BB 8? Wait, that's confusing: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\" and \"Seat 1 post_bb 8\". But I'm BB. Maybe Seat 1 is SB? Let's think: typical order: SB, BB, then positions. Seat 5 posted SB 4, Seat 1 posted BB 8. That means Seat 5 is SB, Seat 1 is BB. But then I'm Seat 3, which would be UTG? Actually if there are 5 players: Seat 5 (SB), Seat 1 (BB), Seat 2 (UTG), Seat 3 (MP), Seat 4 (CO). But I'm Seat 3, so I'm MP. But description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". So maybe Seat 1 is not BB? Wait, the actions: Seat 5 post_sb 4, Seat 1 post_bb 8. So Seat 1 is BB. But my position says BB. Possibly there's a discrepancy. Let me re-read: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Maybe the table is 6-max? Actually there are 5 players listed: Seat 1, Seat 2, Seat 3 (me), Seat 4, Seat 5. Seat 2 is folded already (0 chips). So maybe Seat 2 was UTG and folded pre? Not shown. Anyway, I have Ac Kh, a strong hand. I raised to 28 (3.5x BB). Then the BB (Seat 1) reraised to 200 total. That's a huge raise, almost all-in (they have only 8 chips? Wait, Seat 1 has 8 chips according to the list: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\". But they raised to 200? That can't be right - they only have 8 chips. Maybe the stack listing is wrong? Let's examine: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\". But they raised to 200 total. That would be more than their stack. Unless the stack is 8 BB? Actually blinds are 4/8, so 8 chips is 1 BB. But they raised to 200 chips (25 BB). That's impossible if they only have 8 chips. Maybe the stack listing is in BB? \"8 chips\" might be 8 BB? But my stack is listed as \"290 chips (36.2 BB)\". So chips are actual chips. So Seat 1 has 8 chips, but raised to 200? That doesn't add up. Let's check the action: \"preflop: Seat 1 raise 200\". That's a raise to 200 total. But they only have 8 chips. Something is off. Perhaps the stack listing is their stack before posting blinds? Seat 1 posted BB 8, so they had 8 chips left after posting? Actually if they had 8 chips and posted BB 8, they'd be all-in. But they raised to 200, which is impossible. Let me think: maybe the stack listing is after they posted? They had 8 chips, posted BB 8, now have 0? But they raised to 200? That can't be. Maybe I misread: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\" could be 8 BB? But my stack is shown as chips and BB. Theirs doesn't show BB. Possibly they have 8 BB, which is 64 chips (since BB is 8). But the listing says \"8 chips\". Hmm.\n\nLet me use tools to recall opponent actions to understand their tendencies. Also search for similar situations. First, let's recall opponent actions for Seat 1."

          "content": "Now, I need to understand the situation better. Looking at opponent actions: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 actions are folds). They showed down hands like 9s8s, 9s9d, As8h, 9h8s. So they play some speculative hands and pocket pairs. Now they raised to 200 after my raise. This is a massive reraise. Given their stack size is listed as 8 chips, but they raised to 200, there must be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the stack listing is in BB? Let's calculate: Blinds are 4/8. My stack is 290 chips (36.2 BB). So 36.2 BB = 290 chips, so BB = 8 chips (290/36.2 \u2248 8). So BB is 8 chips. So 8 chips = 1 BB. So Seat 1 has 8 chips = 1 BB. That makes sense: they have 1 BB. But they raised to 200 chips? That would be 25 BB. That's impossible with 1 BB stack. Unless the raise amount is total including their blind? Let's parse: \"preflop: Seat 1 raise 200\". That could be the total amount they put in, including their BB of 8. So they raised by 192 more (200 total). But they only have 8 chips. So they'd be all-in for their remaining stack. Actually if they have 8 chips total, and they already posted BB 8, they have 0 left. But they raised to 200? That doesn't compute. Maybe the stack listing is before posting? They had 8 chips, posted BB 8, now have 0, but they can't raise. Something is wrong.\n\nLet's think differently: maybe the stack listing is \"8 chips\" meaning 8 big blinds? Not chips. But my stack is listed as \"290 chips (36.2 BB)\". So chips are separate from BB. So Seat 1 has 8 chips, not 8 BB. That's 1 BB. But they raised to 200 chips (25 BB). That's impossible. Unless the raise is 200 chips total, and they have more than 8 chips. Possibly the stack listing is outdated or there's a mistake. Let's look at the pot size: Pot is 232 chips. How did that happen? Let's calculate: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, I raised to 28, then Seat 1 raised to 200. So pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + my 28 + Seat 1's 200 = 240? Wait, Seat 1's raise includes their BB? They already posted BB 8, so they put additional 192 to make total 200. So pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + my 28 + Seat 1 additional 192 = 232. Yes, that's correct. So Seat 1 put in 192 more on top of their BB. So they have at least 192 chips more than their BB. So their stack must be larger than 8 chips. The listing must be wrong. Maybe \"8 chips\" is their remaining after posting? No, they posted BB 8, so if they had 8 chips, they'd be all-in. But they raised 192 more, so they must have had at least 200 chips total before posting? Actually, they posted BB 8, then raised to 200 total, so they put in 192 more. So they need at least 192 chips after posting BB. So their stack before posting was at least 200 chips. The listing \"8 chips\" is likely a display error or maybe it's 8 BB (64 chips). But 8 BB = 64 chips, still not enough for 200 total. So maybe it's 200 chips total, and they have enough. I need to make a decision based on the situation.\n\nI have Ac Kh, a premium hand. Facing a reraise to 200 total. I have 290 chips total. I already put in 28? Wait, I raised to 28 from BB. So I have 290 chips total, I put in 28, so I have 262 left. Amount to call is 172 more (since I already put 28, and total to call is 200? Actually amount to call: 172. That means I need to put 172 more to match the 200 total. So if I call, I'll have 262 - 172 = 90 chips left. Pot after my call would be 232 + 172 = 404 chips. I'm getting pot odds of 172 to win 404, which is about 1:2.35, or 30% equity needed. Against a range of premium pairs ("

That doesn't add up. Let's check the action: \"preflop: Seat 1 raise 200\". That's a raise to 200 total. But they only have 8 chips. Something is off. Perhaps the stack listing is their stack before posting blinds? Seat 1 posted BB 8, so they had 8 chips left after posting? Actually if they had 8 chips and posted BB 8, they'd be all-in. But they raised to 200, which is impossible. Let me think: maybe the stack listing is after they posted? They had 8 chips, posted BB 8, now have 0? But they raised to 200? That can't be. Maybe I misread: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\" could be 8 BB? But my stack is shown as chips and BB. Theirs doesn't show BB. Possibly they have 8 BB, which is 64 chips (since BB is 8). But the listing says \"8 chips\". Hmm.\n\nLet me use tools to recall opponent actions to understand their tendencies. Also search for similar situations. First, let's recall opponent actions for Seat 1.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now, I need to understand the situation better. Looking at opponent actions: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 actions are folds). They showed down hands like 9s8s, 9s9d, As8h, 9h8s. So they play some speculative hands and pocket pairs. Now they raised to 200 after my raise. This is a massive reraise. Given their stack size is listed as 8 chips, but they raised to 200, there must be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the stack listing is in BB? Let's calculate: Blinds are 4/8. My stack is 290 chips (36.2 BB). So 36.2 BB = 290 chips, so BB = 8 chips (290/36.2 \u2248 8). So BB is 8 chips. So 8 chips = 1 BB. So Seat 1 has 8 chips = 1 BB. That makes sense: they have 1 BB. But they raised to 200 chips? That would be 25 BB. That's impossible with 1 BB stack. Unless the raise amount is total including their blind? Let's parse: \"preflop: Seat 1 raise 200\". That could be the total amount they put in, including their BB of 8. So they raised by 192 more (200 total). But they only have 8 chips. So they'd be all-in for their remaining stack. Actually if they have 8 chips total, and they already posted BB 8, they have 0 left. But they raised to 200? That doesn't compute. Maybe the stack listing is before posting? They had 8 chips, posted BB 8, now have 0, but they can't raise. Something is wrong.\n\nLet's think differently: maybe the stack listing is \"8 chips\" meaning 8 big blinds? Not chips. But my stack is listed as \"290 chips (36.2 BB)\". So chips are separate from BB. So Seat 1 has 8 chips, not 8 BB. That's 1 BB. But they raised to 200 chips (25 BB). That's impossible. Unless the raise is 200 chips total, and they have more than 8 chips. Possibly the stack listing is outdated or there's a mistake. Let's look at the pot size: Pot is 232 chips. How did that happen? Let's calculate: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, I raised to 28, then Seat 1 raised to 200. So pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + my 28 + Seat 1's 200 = 240? Wait, Seat 1's raise includes their BB? They already posted BB 8, so they put additional 192 to make total 200. So pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + my 28 + Seat 1 additional 192 = 232. Yes, that's correct. So Seat 1 put in 192 more on top of their BB. So they have at least 192 chips more than their BB. So their stack must be larger than 8 chips. The listing must be wrong. Maybe \"8 chips\" is their remaining after posting? No, they posted BB 8, so if they had 8 chips, they'd be all-in. But they raised 192 more, so they must have had at least 200 chips total before posting? Actually, they posted BB 8, then raised to 200 total, so they put in 192 more. So they need at least 192 chips after posting BB. So their stack before posting was at least 200 chips. The listing \"8 chips\" is likely a display error or maybe it's 8 BB (64 chips). But 8 BB = 64 chips, still not enough for 200 total. So maybe it's 200 chips total, and they have enough. I need to make a decision based on the situation.\n\nI have Ac Kh, a premium hand. Facing a reraise to 200 total. I have 290 chips total. I already put in 28? Wait, I raised to 28 from BB. So I have 290 chips total, I put in 28, so I have 262 left. Amount to call is 172 more (since I already put 28, and total to call is 200? Actually amount to call: 172. That means I need to put 172 more to match the 200 total. So if I call, I'll have 262 - 172 = 90 chips left. Pot after my call would be 232 + 172 = 404 chips. I'm getting pot odds of 172 to win 404, which is about 1:2.35, or 30% equity needed. Against a range of premium pairs (",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to provide a JSON response. Let me think about the decision.\n\nI have Ac Kh, facing a reraise to 200 total. My stack is 290 chips. I already put in 28. Amount to call is 172 more. If I call, I'll have 90 chips left. Pot will be 404 chips. I'm getting pot odds of 172 to win 404, which is about 30% equity needed.\n\nAgainst a typical 3-bet range from the BB (Seat 1), what could they have? They might have premium pairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, maybe AK). Possibly they're squeezing with a wider range given the dynamics? But they only have 8 chips listed, but that must be wrong. Actually, let me check the opponent's actions more. I should use the recall tool to see their previous raises. But I need to output JSON now.\n\nGiven the situation: I have AK suited? Actually Ac Kh is offsuit. Still a strong hand. Facing a massive reraise. This could be a shove given stack sizes? The minimum raise to is 372, which is more than my stack (I have 290 total). So I can only call or fold. I cannot raise because \"raise\" is not in legal actions (only fold, call). So I must either fold or call.\n\nIf I call, I'm committing 172 more with 90 behind. The pot will be 404, and effective stack for the flop will be 90 (since I have 90 left). That's about 11 BB (blinds 4/8, so 90 chips = 11.25 BB). So I'll be pot committed on most flops.\n\nGiven the strength of AK and the pot odds, calling seems reasonable. However, this opponent raised to 200 total, which is a huge overbet relative to pot. That suggests extreme strength. They might have AA or KK. But AK is a hand that does well against many premium pairs except AA and KK. Against AA, I have about 12% equity. Against KK, about 30% equity. Against QQ, about 46% equity. Against AK, 50% equity. Against JJ, 48% equity. So my average equity against a tight range (QQ+, AK) is around 40%. That's better than the 30% needed. So mathematically, call is profitable.\n\nBut tournament considerations: I have 36 BB stack. If I call and lose, I'll be down to 90 chips (11 BB). If I win, I'll have 290 + 232 = 522 chips? Wait, if I call and win, I'll have my remaining 90 plus the pot of 404 = 494 chips? Actually, I'd have 90 left after calling, plus win pot of 404, total 494 chips (61.75 BB). That's a big increase. If I fold, I'll have 262 chips (32.75 BB). So risk vs reward: risk 172 to win 232 (the pot before my call). Actually pot before my call is 232. I need to call 172 to win 232, so pot odds are 1:1.35, which is worse. Wait, I need to calculate correctly.\n\nPot before my decision: 232 chips. I need to call 172. So pot odds are 172 to win 232, which is 1:1.35, meaning I need 42.5% equity (172/(172+232)=0.425). That's higher. Against QQ+, AK, my equity is about 40%. Slightly below. But if I include some bluffs or wider hands, equity improves. However, given the huge raise size, this looks like a very strong hand. Could be AA or KK. That would reduce my equity.\n\nBut also, the opponent's stack is unclear. They might be short-stacked and shoving? Actually, they raised to 200, not all-in. Minimum raise to is 372, so they have more behind. They might have a bigger stack than listed.\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the fact that I'm out of position (I'm BB, they are... actually they are BB? Wait, I'm BB according to position. But Seat 1 posted BB. So maybe I'm not BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 3)\". Maybe there's a discrepancy. Regardless, I'm out of position relative to the raiser.\n\nI think I should call. AK is too strong to fold for 42.5% pot odds. Even against a tight range, it's close. But tournament life: losing would leave me with 11 BB, still playable. Winning would give me 61 BB, a great stack.\n\nI'll call. Let's output JSON.",

Opponent only has 8 chips total - they're essentially all-in preflop\n2. The pot is 404 chips, which is huge relative to stacks\n3. The flop is 6h 3c 9h - this is a relatively dry board that likely didn't hit my opponent's range hard\n4. My hand is AK offsuit - I have two overcards (Ace and King) to the board\n5. Opponent checked on the flop (they're essentially all-in, so checking is automatic)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding a lot preflop (7 of 10 recorded actions were folds). They only showed aggression in hand #56 where they bet 16 on the flop. This suggests they might be tight/passive.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- Opponent has only 8 chips left, so they're essentially all-in\n- The pot is already 404 chips, and I have 118 chips total\n- I called their all-in preflop with AK, which is standard\n- On this flop, my AK has about 50% equity against most reasonable ranges\n- Since opponent is all-in, I should check and see the turn and river\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check. The opponent is all-in (only 8 chips), so there's no more betting. Checking allows the hand to continue to showdown. My AK has good equity against most hands, and checking is the only logical play since the opponent has no chips left to bet.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Opponent is essentially all-in with only 8 chips remaining.

          "content": "I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the BB with Ac Kh. My stack is 118 chips (14.8 BB). The board is 6h 3c 9h Qs. Pot is 404 chips. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has only 8 chips left. They raised to 200 preflop, which was essentially all-in (they had 8 chips to start, posted BB of 8, then raised 200, so they must have gone all-in). I called 172 more preflop (my initial raise was 28, so total I put in 28+172=200). So we both have 200 in the pot? Wait, let's track: Seat 1 started with 8 chips, posted BB 8, then raised 200 total? Actually, they posted BB 8, then raised to 200 total. That's a raise of 192 more? Let's compute: They had 8 chips total. They posted BB 8, leaving 0. Then they raised to 200 total, which would require 192 more, but they only had 0 left. So they actually went all-in for their remaining stack of 8? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's re-examine: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips. They posted BB 8, so they have 0 left. Then they \"raise 200\". That must be a misprint? Actually, maybe they had 8 chips after posting BB? No, they posted BB 8, so they'd have 0. But the action says \"Seat 1 raise 200\". That seems impossible. Perhaps they had 208 chips originally? But the table shows 8 chips now. Maybe they started with more and lost some? Let's look at stack sizes: Seat 1: 8 chips, Seat 2: 0 chips folded, Seat 3 (me): 118, Seat 4: 230 folded, Seat 5: 206 folded.\n\nSo Seat 1 has only 8 chips. The preflop action: Seat 5 posts SB 4, Seat 1 posts BB 8, Seat 3 (me) raises to 28, Seat 4 folds, Seat 5 folds, Seat 1 raises to 200, Seat 3 calls 172. That means Seat 1 raised to 200 total, which is 192 more than the BB of 8. But they only have 8 chips total, so they can't raise to 200. Unless they had more chips earlier? Actually, maybe they had 200 chips before posting BB? But the current stack is 8. That suggests they lost chips in this hand? Wait, maybe the stack sizes shown are current, after the action? Let's think: If Seat 1 raised to 200, they'd need 192 more on top of their BB 8. That would be 200 total. They'd need at least 192 chips. But they show 8 chips now. That means they must have put all their chips in and are now all-in with 8? Actually, maybe they had 200 chips, posted BB 8 (192 left), then raised to 200 total (putting in 192 more), leaving 0. So they'd be all-in. That would make sense: they started with 200, posted BB 8, raised all-in for remaining 192, total 200. But the display shows 8 chips now. That might be a bug or misrepresentation. Possibly the stack shown is what they have left after the action? If they went all-in for 192, they'd have 0 left. But it shows 8. Hmm.\n\nAnyway, the key point: Seat 1 has only 8 chips left. They checked on the flop and turn. The pot is 404 chips. I have Ac Kh, board 6h 3c 9h Qs. I have ace-high with backdoor flush draw (hearts) and gutshot straight draw? Actually, A-K on board 6-3-9-Q gives me ace-high, no pair. I have two overcards (A and K), but the queen is on board, so only ace is an overcard. I have backdoor nut flush draw (hearts). I also have a gutshot straight draw: need a ten for a straight (10-J? Actually, board 6-3-9-Q, I have A-K, so I need a ten to make a straight? That would be K-Q-10-9-8? No. Let's compute: Board 6-3-9-Q. My hand A-K. Possible straights: if a ten comes, I'd have A-K-Q-10-9? That's not a straight. If a jack comes, I'd have A-K-Q"

          "content": "I need to understand the situation better. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot preflop. In hand 56, they had 9h8s and bet on flop with Ace-high board, then checked turn and river. They seem to be a tight player. But in this hand, they raised to 200 preflop with only 8 chips stack? That seems like a desperate all-in move. They likely have a strong hand like a big pair or AK/AQ. Given they have only 8 chips left, they're essentially all-in. The pot is 404 chips. I have Ac Kh, board 6h 3c 9h Qs. I have ace-high with backdoor flush draw. The opponent checked both flop and turn. Since they're all-in (or nearly all-in), they can't bet anymore. They're just waiting for the river. I have to decide whether to check or bet. Actually, my legal actions are fold or check. I cannot bet because the amount to call is 0 and I can only check. Wait, the prompt says \"Legal actions: fold, check\". That means I can only check or fold. But why would I fold when there's nothing to call? That doesn't make sense. Unless there's a side pot? Let's think: If Seat 1 is all-in for less than my bet, there might be a main pot and side pot. But they have 8 chips now. They raised to 200 preflop, I called 172. The total pot should be: My 200 + their 200? Actually, they raised to 200, but they only had 8 chips total? Let's recalc: They started with 8 chips. They posted BB 8, so they have 0 left. Then they \"raise 200\". That must mean they went all-in for their remaining 0? That's impossible. Maybe the stack display is wrong. Perhaps they had 208 chips originally? But the table shows 8 now. Could be they lost chips in this hand? Actually, maybe the stack sizes shown are at the start of the hand? Let's look: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\". That's likely their stack at the start of the hand. They posted BB 8, leaving 0. Then they \"raise 200\" - that's likely a misprint; maybe they raised all-in for their remaining stack? But they have 0 left after posting BB. So they can't raise. Unless they had more than 8. Hmm.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume Seat 1 is all-in or nearly all-in. The pot is 404 chips. I have 118 chips total. I've already put in 200? Wait, I raised to 28 preflop, then called 172 more, so I've put in 200 total. That's more than my stack of 118. That's impossible. Something is off. Let's compute: My stack is 118 chips. I raised to 28 preflop (that's 20 more than BB 8). Then Seat 1 raised to 200, and I called 172 more. That would be 28 + 172 = 200 total. But I only have 118 chips, so I can't call 172 more. Unless my stack was larger at start? The display says \"Your Stack: 118 chips (14.8 BB)\". That's current stack after the action? Possibly after calling 172, I'd have 118 left? Let's calculate: If I started with 118 + 200 = 318? No.\n\nI think the stack sizes shown are current after the action. So I have 118 chips left after putting in 200. That means I started with 318 chips. That makes sense: I had 318, put in 200, leaving 118. Seat 1 started with 208 chips, posted BB 8 (200 left), raised to 200 total (put in 192 more), leaving 8. So they have 8 chips left. Yes, that fits: Seat 1 has 8 chips left after putting in 200. So they are essentially all-in; their remaining 8 chips are not in the main pot? Actually, the main pot includes their 200. The side pot would be between me and any other players, but others folded. So there's only main pot of 404 chips (my 200 + their 200 + blinds 4 from SB). Actually, SB folded preflop after posting 4, so that 4 is in pot. So total pot = 200 (me) + 200 (Seat 1) + 4 (SB) = 404. Yes.\n\nNow, Seat 1 is all-in for 200, and has 8 chips left. They cannot bet further"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze the current situation. I'm in the BB with Ac Kh. My stack is 118 chips (14.8 BB). The board is 6h 3c 9h Qs. Pot is 404 chips. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has only 8 chips left. They raised to 200 preflop, which was essentially all-in (they had 8 chips to start, posted BB of 8, then raised 200, so they must have gone all-in). I called 172 more preflop (my initial raise was 28, so total I put in 28+172=200). So we both have 200 in the pot? Wait, let's track: Seat 1 started with 8 chips, posted BB 8, then raised 200 total? Actually, they posted BB 8, then raised to 200 total. That's a raise of 192 more? Let's compute: They had 8 chips total. They posted BB 8, leaving 0. Then they raised to 200 total, which would require 192 more, but they only had 0 left. So they actually went all-in for their remaining stack of 8? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let's re-examine: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips. They posted BB 8, so they have 0 left. Then they \"raise 200\". That must be a misprint? Actually, maybe they had 8 chips after posting BB? No, they posted BB 8, so they'd have 0. But the action says \"Seat 1 raise 200\". That seems impossible. Perhaps they had 208 chips originally? But the table shows 8 chips now. Maybe they started with more and lost some? Let's look at stack sizes: Seat 1: 8 chips, Seat 2: 0 chips folded, Seat 3 (me): 118, Seat 4: 230 folded, Seat 5: 206 folded.\n\nSo Seat 1 has only 8 chips. The preflop action: Seat 5 posts SB 4, Seat 1 posts BB 8, Seat 3 (me) raises to 28, Seat 4 folds, Seat 5 folds, Seat 1 raises to 200, Seat 3 calls 172. That means Seat 1 raised to 200 total, which is 192 more than the BB of 8. But they only have 8 chips total, so they can't raise to 200. Unless they had more chips earlier? Actually, maybe they had 200 chips before posting BB? But the current stack is 8. That suggests they lost chips in this hand? Wait, maybe the stack sizes shown are current, after the action? Let's think: If Seat 1 raised to 200, they'd need 192 more on top of their BB 8. That would be 200 total. They'd need at least 192 chips. But they show 8 chips now. That means they must have put all their chips in and are now all-in with 8? Actually, maybe they had 200 chips, posted BB 8 (192 left), then raised to 200 total (putting in 192 more), leaving 0. So they'd be all-in. That would make sense: they started with 200, posted BB 8, raised all-in for remaining 192, total 200. But the display shows 8 chips now. That might be a bug or misrepresentation. Possibly the stack shown is what they have left after the action? If they went all-in for 192, they'd have 0 left. But it shows 8. Hmm.\n\nAnyway, the key point: Seat 1 has only 8 chips left. They checked on the flop and turn. The pot is 404 chips. I have Ac Kh, board 6h 3c 9h Qs. I have ace-high with backdoor flush draw (hearts) and gutshot straight draw? Actually, A-K on board 6-3-9-Q gives me ace-high, no pair. I have two overcards (A and K), but the queen is on board, so only ace is an overcard. I have backdoor nut flush draw (hearts). I also have a gutshot straight draw: need a ten for a straight (10-J? Actually, board 6-3-9-Q, I have A-K, so I need a ten to make a straight? That would be K-Q-10-9-8? No. Let's compute: Board 6-3-9-Q. My hand A-K. Possible straights: if a ten comes, I'd have A-K-Q-10-9? That's not a straight. If a jack comes, I'd have A-K-Q",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to understand the situation better. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot preflop. In hand 56, they had 9h8s and bet on flop with Ace-high board, then checked turn and river. They seem to be a tight player. But in this hand, they raised to 200 preflop with only 8 chips stack? That seems like a desperate all-in move. They likely have a strong hand like a big pair or AK/AQ. Given they have only 8 chips left, they're essentially all-in. The pot is 404 chips. I have Ac Kh, board 6h 3c 9h Qs. I have ace-high with backdoor flush draw. The opponent checked both flop and turn. Since they're all-in (or nearly all-in), they can't bet anymore. They're just waiting for the river. I have to decide whether to check or bet. Actually, my legal actions are fold or check. I cannot bet because the amount to call is 0 and I can only check. Wait, the prompt says \"Legal actions: fold, check\". That means I can only check or fold. But why would I fold when there's nothing to call? That doesn't make sense. Unless there's a side pot? Let's think: If Seat 1 is all-in for less than my bet, there might be a main pot and side pot. But they have 8 chips now. They raised to 200 preflop, I called 172. The total pot should be: My 200 + their 200? Actually, they raised to 200, but they only had 8 chips total? Let's recalc: They started with 8 chips. They posted BB 8, so they have 0 left. Then they \"raise 200\". That must mean they went all-in for their remaining 0? That's impossible. Maybe the stack display is wrong. Perhaps they had 208 chips originally? But the table shows 8 now. Could be they lost chips in this hand? Actually, maybe the stack sizes shown are at the start of the hand? Let's look: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 8 chips\". That's likely their stack at the start of the hand. They posted BB 8, leaving 0. Then they \"raise 200\" - that's likely a misprint; maybe they raised all-in for their remaining stack? But they have 0 left after posting BB. So they can't raise. Unless they had more than 8. Hmm.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume Seat 1 is all-in or nearly all-in. The pot is 404 chips. I have 118 chips total. I've already put in 200? Wait, I raised to 28 preflop, then called 172 more, so I've put in 200 total. That's more than my stack of 118. That's impossible. Something is off. Let's compute: My stack is 118 chips. I raised to 28 preflop (that's 20 more than BB 8). Then Seat 1 raised to 200, and I called 172 more. That would be 28 + 172 = 200 total. But I only have 118 chips, so I can't call 172 more. Unless my stack was larger at start? The display says \"Your Stack: 118 chips (14.8 BB)\". That's current stack after the action? Possibly after calling 172, I'd have 118 left? Let's calculate: If I started with 118 + 200 = 318? No.\n\nI think the stack sizes shown are current after the action. So I have 118 chips left after putting in 200. That means I started with 318 chips. That makes sense: I had 318, put in 200, leaving 118. Seat 1 started with 208 chips, posted BB 8 (200 left), raised to 200 total (put in 192 more), leaving 8. So they have 8 chips left. Yes, that fits: Seat 1 has 8 chips left after putting in 200. So they are essentially all-in; their remaining 8 chips are not in the main pot? Actually, the main pot includes their 200. The side pot would be between me and any other players, but others folded. So there's only main pot of 404 chips (my 200 + their 200 + blinds 4 from SB). Actually, SB folded preflop after posting 4, so that 4 is in pot. So total pot = 200 (me) + 200 (Seat 1) + 4 (SB) = 404. Yes.\n\nNow, Seat 1 is all-in for 200, and has 8 chips left. They cannot bet further",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have more context. The opponent (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 8 hands they folded preflop). In hand 56, they had 9h8s and bet on flop with Ace-high board, then checked turn and river. They seem to be a tight player who folds most hands preflop. Their preflop raise to 200 (all-in) with only 8 chips stack indicates desperation or a strong hand. Given their tight tendencies, they likely have a premium hand: AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe JJ. The board has Qs, which hits QQ. I have Ac Kh, so I'm behind most of their range. I have ace-high with backdoor flush draw. The pot is 404 chips. I have 118 chips left. The opponent is all-in (or has 8 chips left). They checked flop and turn because they're all-in and cannot bet further. I have to decide whether to check or fold. Folding seems ridiculous when there's no bet to call. But wait, why is fold a legal action? Possibly because there's a side pot? Actually, the opponent has 8 chips left. They could potentially bet those 8 chips on the river? But they checked turn. On the river, they might bet their last 8 chips. But currently, amount to call is 0. I should check and see the river. There's no reason to fold when I don't have to put more chips in. I can check and see the river card for free. If the opponent bets 8 chips on river, I'll have to decide whether to call 8 chips into a 404 pot (huge pot odds). That's an easy call with any chance. So I should check now. Let me think about my hand: Ac Kh on board 6h 3c 9h Qs. I have ace-high, backdoor nut flush draw (hearts). I need a heart on river for flush (would be nut flush). I also have gutshot straight draw? Actually, need a ten for a straight? Board: 6-3-9-Q. My hand A-K. If a ten comes, I'd have A-K-Q-10-9? That's not a straight. If a jack comes, I'd have A-K-Q-J-9? Not a straight. So no straight draw. Only flush draw. So I have 9 outs for flush (13 hearts - 2 on board - 2 in my hand? I have Ac Kh, so I have Kh (heart). Board has 6h and 9h? Wait board: 6h 3c 9h Qs. So there are two hearts on board: 6h and 9h. I have Kh. So there are 13 hearts total, minus 3 known hearts = 10 remaining. But I need a heart on river for flush. So 10 outs. However, some of those hearts might give opponent a flush if they have hearts? Unlikely. So about 20% chance to hit flush on river. Pot is 404, and I might have to call 8 chips on river if opponent bets. That's trivial pot odds. So I should check.\n\nBut wait, could I bet? Legal actions are only fold or check. So I cannot bet. So I must check. There's no decision to make really. However, maybe there's a side pot? Actually, the opponent has 8 chips left. If I bet, I could bet into a side pot? But I can't bet because legal actions don't include bet or raise. So I'll check.\n\nThus my action is check. Let me output JSON.",

Preflop: I raised to 28 from BB (standard with AK)\n2. Opponent 3-bet to 200 from BB (seat 1) - very large sizing\n3. I called 172 more (putting in 200 total)\n4. Flop: 6h 3c 9h - opponent checked, I checked back\n5. Turn: Qs - opponent checked, I checked back  \n6. River: 2s - opponent checked\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. Opponent only has 8 chips left (1 BB) - they're essentially all-in already\n2. The pot is massive at 404 chips\n3. My hand: Ace-high with AK (no pair)\n4. Board is low cards with Q high, no obvious draws completed (flush draws missed)\n5. Opponent showed extreme aggression preflop with a huge 3-bet to 200 (25 BB)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies from Memory:**\n- I see they've made several preflop raises, including some large ones (28, 24, 12)\n- They've checked rivers multiple times and sometimes folded to bets\n- No showdown data available\n\n**Hand Strength Analysis:**\n- I have Ace-high only on this board\n- Possible opponent holdings: \n  - Strong pairs (QQ+, maybe 99, 66, 33) - would likely bet river for value\n  - Missed draws (hearts, straight draws) - checking makes sense\n  - Bluffs (A5s, other Ax hands) - checking makes sense\n  - Medium pairs (JJ, TT, maybe 88) - might check\n\n**Decision Points:**\n- Since opponent only has 8 chips left, any bet would effectively put them all-in\n- They checked to me, giving me the option to check or bet\n- With Ace-high, I'm likely behind most value hands\n- However, the opponent's river check after aggressive preflop suggests weakness\n\n**Pot Odds Consideration:**\n- Pot is 404 chips\n- To bet, I'd need to risk my remaining 118 chips (but opponent only has 8 to call)\n- If I bet 8 (or any amount up to 118), opponent would need to call their last 8\n- If they fold, I win 404 chips\n- If they call with better, I lose my bet (max 8 chips since they only have 8)\n\nActually wait - I need to think about this more carefully. The opponent has only 8 chips left. If I bet ANY amount, they can only call up to 8 chips. So I could bet 8 chips (or less) and they'd have to decide whether to call with their last 8.\n\nBut actually, looking at the legal actions: I only have \"fold\" or \"check\" available. That means I cannot bet/raise here. The minimum raise to would be 172, but I only have 118 chips total. However, I should be able to bet since opponent checked to me... unless there's something about the opponent having only 8 chips?\n\nLet me re-read: \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check\". So I cannot bet here. That must be because the opponent only has 8 chips and is effectively all-in? Or maybe because I'm last to act and they checked?\n\nActually, in poker when someone is all-in for less than a full bet, and they check, the other player can only check or fold - they cannot bet because the all-in player has no chips to call a bet. That makes sense here.\n\nSo my options are:\n1. Check - go to showdown\n2. Fold - surrender the pot\n\nWith 404 chips in the pot and only Ace-high, but opponent showing weakness by checking all streets after aggressive preflop, I should check and see what they have. Folding would be terrible since I've already invested 200 chips and the pot is huge.\n\n**Final Decision:** Check and see showdown. I have Ace-high which might be good if opponent was bluffing or has a weaker hand. Given opponent's extreme preflop aggression and subsequent checking on all streets, they likely have a missed draw or medium pair that's afraid of the Q on board.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\":"

Looking at opponent tendencies: GPT-OSS-120B (in BB) has been raising preflop frequently (5 raises in recent hands). They've been raising to amounts like 20, 24 chips, which are small raises.\n\nMy stack is short (7.4 BB). With A9o from the button, I should be looking to play aggressively. The pot is 24 chips, and I need to call 16 to see a flop. If I raise, minimum raise is to 32 total (16 more).\n\nGiven my short stack, I should consider going all-in or making a substantial raise. A9o is strong enough to play for my stack against likely blinds. The BB has been aggressive, so they might call with a wide range.\n\nIf I just call 16, I'll have 102 left and pot will be 40. That's not ideal with a short stack. Better to raise and put pressure on.\n\nI could go all-in (118 total). That would be a 102 raise over the BB. That's a strong move that might take it down preflop, and if called, A9o has decent equity against most hands.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I'm very short (7.4 BB). Need to accumulate chips soon. A9o from button is a good spot to double up or steal blinds.\n\nI'll go all-in.",

This hand has very little potential to make strong hands, and even when it does hit a pair, it's a weak pair vulnerable to overcards.\n\nStack size considerations: With 8.9 BB, I'm getting into push/fold territory, but not with this hand from UTG. I should be looking for better spots to get my chips in, preferably when I have fold equity or a stronger hand.\n\nOpponent tendencies: Looking at the data, MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot recently (folded last 4 hands). GPT-OSS-120B has also been folding frequently. However, I'm first to act, so I don't know what they'll do after me.\n\nPot odds: I'd need to call 16 chips into a pot of 24, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds (40% equity needed). My hand doesn't have anywhere near that equity against random hands.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm short-stacked and need to preserve my stack for better opportunities. Calling or raising with this hand would be spewing chips.\n\nThe only reasonable play is to fold. Even if I were on the button or in late position with this stack size, 7-5 offsuit is still a fold. From UTG, it's an especially easy fold.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors I should consider... No, this is clear cut."

My stack is only 142 chips (8.9 BB), which is very short. The blinds are 8/16, so I'm in the small blind structure.\n\nLooking at my position and hand: UTG with 7-5 offsuit is an automatic fold in almost all situations. This hand has very little potential to make strong hands, and even when it does hit a pair, it's a weak pair vulnerable to overcards.\n\nStack size considerations: With 8.9 BB, I'm getting into push/fold territory, but not with this hand from UTG. I should be looking for better spots to get my chips in, preferably when I have fold equity or a stronger hand.\n\nOpponent tendencies: Looking at the data, MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot recently (folded last 4 hands). GPT-OSS-120B has also been folding frequently. However, I'm first to act, so I don't know what they'll do after me.\n\nPot odds: I'd need to call 16 chips into a pot of 24, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds (40% equity needed). My hand doesn't have anywhere near that equity against random hands.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm short-stacked and need to preserve my stack for better opportunities. Calling or raising with this hand would be spewing chips.\n\nThe only reasonable play is to fold. Even if I were on the button or in late position with this stack size, 7-5 offsuit is still a fold. From UTG, it's an especially easy fold.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors I should consider... No, this is clear cut.",

          "content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with K2 offsuit. My stack is 126 chips (7.9 BB). The pot is 198 chips. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 174 total, but wait, Seat 5 has 0 chips and is marked \"out\"? That seems contradictory. Let me re-read: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). But it says \"Seat 5 raise 174\". That can't be right if they have 0 chips. Maybe it's a misprint or they went all-in with their last chips? The pot is 198, which includes blinds (8+16=24) plus the raise. If Seat 5 raised to 174 total, that would be 174-16=158 more than my BB. Amount to call is 158, which matches. My stack is 126, so I can't even call the full amount - I only have 126 total, and I've already put in 16 as BB. So I have 110 chips left. To call 158, I'd need to put in 110 more (all-in). Actually, let me calculate: I have 126 total. I've already put 16 in as BB. So I have 110 left. The amount to call is 158, which is more than my remaining stack. So I can go all-in for my remaining 110. That would be a call of my entire stack.\n\nBut wait, the legal actions are only fold or call. No raise option. So I can either fold or call all-in. Let's think about the hand: K2 offsuit is a terrible hand, especially against a raise. The raiser is Seat 5 who has 0 chips and is marked \"out\" - maybe they're actually all-in? That would make sense: they went all-in with their last chips. If they have 0 chips, they must be all-in. But the raise amount is 174, which seems high. Maybe they had some chips and went all-in.\n\nI need to consider tournament situation: I have 126 chips (7.9 BB). That's very short-stacked. The blinds are 8/16, so I'm in danger of blinding out soon. I'm in the BB, so I've already put in 16. If I fold, I'll have 110 chips left (6.9 BB). If I call all-in and win, I'd double up to about 252 chips (15.8 BB). If I lose, I'm out.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 198. To call, I need to put in 110 more (my remaining stack). So pot is offering 198:110, or about 1.8:1. I need about 35% equity to break even. Does K2o have 35% equity against a typical all-in range?\n\nLet me think about opponent's range. Seat 5 is short-stacked (0 chips? actually they raised, so they must have had chips). They raised from UTG? Actually seat positions: Seat 1 is SB, Seat 2 folded, Seat 3 is me (BB), Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 raised. So Seat 5 is UTG? Actually with 5 players, positions: SB (Seat 1), BB (me, Seat 3), UTG (Seat 4), MP (Seat 5), CO (none). So Seat 5 raised from MP position. They might be stealing or have a decent hand.\n\nBut K2o is really bad. Against a reasonable all-in range like 22+, A2s+, K2s+, Q2s+, J2s+, T2s+, 92s+, 82s+, 72s+, 62s+, 52s+, 42s+, 32s, A2o+, K2o+, Q2o+, J2o+, T2o+, 92o+, 82o+, 72o+, 62o+, 52o+, 42o+, 32o (any pair, any ace, any king, any two broadway, any suited), K2o has about 35% equity. Actually let me estimate: K2o vs top 50% range has about 40% equity. But if opponent is really tight (top 20%), K2o has maybe 30% equity. With my short stack, I might need to gamble.\n\nI should also consider that if I fold, I'll have 110 chips (6.9 BB) and be in SB next hand (posting 8). So I'll have 102 after posting SB, then need to play from SB. That's still very short.\n\nI need to recall opponent tendencies. Let me use the tools to see Seat 5's actions."

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with K2 offsuit. My stack is 126 chips (7.9 BB). The pot is 198 chips. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 174 total, but wait, Seat 5 has 0 chips and is marked \"out\"? That seems contradictory. Let me re-read: Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out). But it says \"Seat 5 raise 174\". That can't be right if they have 0 chips. Maybe it's a misprint or they went all-in with their last chips? The pot is 198, which includes blinds (8+16=24) plus the raise. If Seat 5 raised to 174 total, that would be 174-16=158 more than my BB. Amount to call is 158, which matches. My stack is 126, so I can't even call the full amount - I only have 126 total, and I've already put in 16 as BB. So I have 110 chips left. To call 158, I'd need to put in 110 more (all-in). Actually, let me calculate: I have 126 total. I've already put 16 in as BB. So I have 110 left. The amount to call is 158, which is more than my remaining stack. So I can go all-in for my remaining 110. That would be a call of my entire stack.\n\nBut wait, the legal actions are only fold or call. No raise option. So I can either fold or call all-in. Let's think about the hand: K2 offsuit is a terrible hand, especially against a raise. The raiser is Seat 5 who has 0 chips and is marked \"out\" - maybe they're actually all-in? That would make sense: they went all-in with their last chips. If they have 0 chips, they must be all-in. But the raise amount is 174, which seems high. Maybe they had some chips and went all-in.\n\nI need to consider tournament situation: I have 126 chips (7.9 BB). That's very short-stacked. The blinds are 8/16, so I'm in danger of blinding out soon. I'm in the BB, so I've already put in 16. If I fold, I'll have 110 chips left (6.9 BB). If I call all-in and win, I'd double up to about 252 chips (15.8 BB). If I lose, I'm out.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 198. To call, I need to put in 110 more (my remaining stack). So pot is offering 198:110, or about 1.8:1. I need about 35% equity to break even. Does K2o have 35% equity against a typical all-in range?\n\nLet me think about opponent's range. Seat 5 is short-stacked (0 chips? actually they raised, so they must have had chips). They raised from UTG? Actually seat positions: Seat 1 is SB, Seat 2 folded, Seat 3 is me (BB), Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 raised. So Seat 5 is UTG? Actually with 5 players, positions: SB (Seat 1), BB (me, Seat 3), UTG (Seat 4), MP (Seat 5), CO (none). So Seat 5 raised from MP position. They might be stealing or have a decent hand.\n\nBut K2o is really bad. Against a reasonable all-in range like 22+, A2s+, K2s+, Q2s+, J2s+, T2s+, 92s+, 82s+, 72s+, 62s+, 52s+, 42s+, 32s, A2o+, K2o+, Q2o+, J2o+, T2o+, 92o+, 82o+, 72o+, 62o+, 52o+, 42o+, 32o (any pair, any ace, any king, any two broadway, any suited), K2o has about 35% equity. Actually let me estimate: K2o vs top 50% range has about 40% equity. But if opponent is really tight (top 20%), K2o has maybe 30% equity. With my short stack, I might need to gamble.\n\nI should also consider that if I fold, I'll have 110 chips (6.9 BB) and be in SB next hand (posting 8). So I'll have 102 after posting SB, then need to play from SB. That's still very short.\n\nI need to recall opponent tendencies. Let me use the tools to see Seat 5's actions.",

Pot offers 198:110 odds (~1.8:1), requiring ~35% equity. K2o has borderline equity against a likely stealing range.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have more information. Looking at Seat 5's actions: they raised in hands 57 and 58 (amounts 20 and 24), which are small raises. In hand 64 they called 8 (BB) then folded. They've folded a lot recently. Their showdown hands show some decent cards: 8h2h (suited), AdTs, KcAd, KsQs, 8h8c. So they play some reasonable hands.\n\nBut in this hand, they raised to 174 total. That's a huge raise compared to their previous raises of 20-24. With my stack of 126 total, if I've already put in 16 as BB, I have 110 left. The raise to 174 means they're putting in 174 total. If they have more than 174 chips, they're not all-in. But the display says they have 0 chips and are \"out\". That's confusing. Maybe it's a display error and they actually have chips. Or maybe they went all-in with their last chips and the system shows 0 because they're all-in.\n\nGiven the pot is 198 (8+16+174), and I need to call 158 but only have 110 left, I would be calling all-in for my remaining 110. So effectively, I'm getting pot odds of 198:110 = 1.8:1. I need ~35% equity.\n\nK2o is terrible. Against a reasonable all-in range from MP, K2o has maybe 30-35% equity. It's borderline. With my short stack (7.9 BB), I'm in push-or-fold territory. Typically with less than 10 BB, you should be looking to shove with any decent hand, but calling off your stack with K2o is questionable.\n\nHowever, if I fold, I'll have 110 left (6.9 BB). Next hand I'm SB, posting 8, leaving 102 (6.4 BB). Then BB posting 16, leaving 86 (5.4 BB). So I'll be very short and blinded down quickly. I might get a better spot, but time is running out.\n\nGiven the pot odds and my desperate situation, I think I should call. K2o has some chance, and I need to double up soon. The opponent might be stealing with a wider range given my short stack.\n\nBut wait, let me check: the raiser is Seat 5. If they have 0 chips and are \"out\", maybe they're actually eliminated? That doesn't make sense if they just raised. Perhaps the \"0 chips\" is a display error, or they went all-in with their last chips. In either case, I'm getting roughly 2:1 on my money.\n\nI think I should call all-in. It's a gamble, but with my stack size, I need to take some risks. K2o isn't great, but it has some equity against many hands.\n\nFinal decision: call all-in.",

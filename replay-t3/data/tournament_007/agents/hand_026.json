            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have Ac Tc - Ace-Ten suited in clubs. This is a decent hand, especially on the button. It's strong enough to play but not a premium hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position. I get to act last post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 raised to 8. Let me look at their history:\n   - They've been relatively tight, folding 7 times out of 20 actions shown\n   - When they do raise preflop (hand 19), it was a min-raise to 4\n   - They've shown willingness to bet post-flop but also fold when facing pressure\n   - In hand 22, they called preflop, bet on flop, then folded to a raise\n   - In hand 23, they called preflop, bet on flop, called a raise, then checked down\n\n4. **Stack Sizes**: \n   - I have 250 chips (62.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - MiniMax-M2 has 250 chips - same as me\n   - The raise is to 8, which is 2x the BB\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: Pot is 14, I need to call 8. That's about 1.75:1 pot odds, which is good for a suited Ace with position.\n\n6. **Tournament Consideration**: With a healthy stack of 62.5 BB, I can afford to see flops with speculative hands like ATs, especially in position.\n\nThe raise from MiniMax-M2 is relatively small (only 2x BB). Given their history of folding to pressure and their relatively tight play, I have a few options:\n\n- **Fold**: Too tight, ATs on button is definitely playable\n- **Call**: Reasonable, I get to see flop in position with a decent hand\n- **Raise**: Could be good to apply pressure, especially given opponent's tendency to fold to pressure\n\nGiven that I have position, a decent hand, and an opponent who seems to play straightforwardly and can fold to pressure, I think a call is the best option. I want to keep the pot small with ATs unless I hit the flop well. \n\nI could consider a 3-bet to apply pressure, but ATs plays better as a call in position where I can control the pot size and make decisions based on flop texture. The opponent's raise size is small enough that calling doesn't commit me too much.\n\nLet me make the call.",

I have 6 outs to top pair plus backdoor flush draw. MiniMax-M2 has shown tendency to bet flops but fold to raises (see hand 22). Good position on button allows me to take control of the hand.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: Tc Ac - I have Ace-Ten of clubs. This is a decent hand with a strong ace.\n2. **Position**: BTN (Button) - Good position, I act last post-flop.\n3. **Stack**: 242 chips (60.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n4. **Board**: 3s 6h Qc - The board is relatively dry with no flush draw (except my backdoor clubs) and no straight draws. There's a Q which is higher than my T.\n5. **Action**: Preflop - Seat 4 raised to 8, I called. Seat 4 then bet 12 on the flop.\n\nLet me analyze MiniMax-M2's tendencies from the data:\n- They raise preflop fairly often (hands 19, 22, 23, 26)\n- They frequently continuation bet on the flop (hands 16, 19, 22, 23, 26)\n- In hand 22, they bet 16 on flop then folded to a raise\n- In hand 23, they bet 8 on flop, called a raise, then checked turn and river\n\nSo MiniMax-M2 is aggressive preflop and on the flop, but can fold to pressure. Their flop bets vary in size.\n\n**Current situation**:\n- Pot: 34 chips\n- Bet to call: 12 chips\n- Pot odds: 34:12 or about 2.8:1\n- I have 2 overcards (A and T) to the board. If MiniMax has a Q, I'm behind. If they have a pocket pair like 99, JJ, etc., I'm also behind.\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (need two more clubs)\n- I have 6 outs to top pair (3 Aces, 3 Tens) = about 24% equity on the turn\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. My hand is marginal - just Ace-high with backdoor draws\n2. I'm in position which is good\n3. MiniMax is aggressive but can fold to pressure\n4. Pot odds are decent (need ~26% equity to call)\n5. I have tournament stack considerations - losing 12 chips won't hurt much\n\n\n6. I could raise as a semi-bluff, but that risks more chips\n\nI see a strategic opportunity here. With my position and the opponent's tendency to fold under pressure, a call makes the most sense. I'll keep the pot small while maintaining the chance to improve my hand. The backdoor flush draw adds a subtle potential for a stronger hand on later streets. Calling allows me to gather more information without committing too many chips prematurely.\n\nThe semi-bluff raise becomes an attractive option given my opponent's past behavior of folding to aggression. By raising, I can potentially win the pot immediately or set up a favorable situation on the turn. The key is applying pressure while keeping my risk manageable.\n\nMy stack size provides flexibility, and the 12-chip investment represents a calculated risk. The potential to take down the pot now or improve my hand makes this a strategic move worth considering.",

It's suited, but ten-high with a weak kicker. Suited connectors need higher cards to be playable. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n1. MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) raised to 8 (2x BB). From history: has been calling and betting but also folding. Seems somewhat active.\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1) called the raise. From history: has been folding a lot recently (folded last 4 hands), but called here. Might have a decent hand.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 22 chips, I need to call 4 chips. That's about 5.5:1 pot odds. However, position is terrible and hand is weak.\n\n**Stack considerations:** I have 239 chips (59.8 BB), which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots from bad position.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have a decent stack. No reason to get involved with Th 2h from SB when facing a raise and a call. Even if I flop a flush draw, I'll be out of position and could face more betting.\n\n**Better spots:** I should wait for better hands in better positions.\n\nThis is an easy fold. I already put in 2 chips as SB, but calling 4 more with Th 2h from SB is -EV.\n\nLet me check if there's any history of opponents bluffing or being loose that might change my decision. Looking at the opponent actions: both have been relatively tight recently. Kimi-K2 Thinking folded last 4 hands preflop. MiniMax-M2 folded last 2 hands preflop. So they're not overly loose.\n\n**Decision:** Fold.",

They seem to play reasonably aggressively. I can see they actually had AKs in hand #20 but lost that showdown.\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): They've been mostly folding preflop, with one call and one raise (12 chips). They seem more passive.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: This is hand #26, so we're still in the early to mid stages. Building stack is important, but I need to be careful not to get too reckless.\n\n7. **Hand strength**: AK suited is very strong, but it's not the absolute nuts (like AA or KK). From UTG, I should raise to build the pot and get value.\n\n8. **Pot odds**: The minimum raise is to 8 chips. With AK suited, I want to raise for value and to thin the field.\n\nGiven that this is a premium hand from UTG position, and my opponents seem to be playing reasonably (not too loose), I should make a standard raise. The minimum raise to 8 chips seems appropriate here - it's enough to build the pot and get value while not being too aggressive for the early stages of the tournament.\n\n\nI'll calculate the precise raise amount, considering the current pot and blind structure.

This 3x raise to 36 chips suggests either a very strong hand or a potential bluff.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 24 chips to win a pot that will be 94 chips (70 + 12 + 12), giving me about 4:1 odds.\n\n**Stack Considerations**: With 238 chips vs their 206, I have enough stack depth to make this call and continue playing based on the turn card.\n\n**Decision**: The combination of my strong hand, good pot odds, and the dry board texture makes calling the most appropriate action. If they have a stronger hand like AQ or a set, I'm still getting good odds to improve. If they're bluffing, I can potentially extract more value on later streets.\n\nThe raise is significant enough that raising back might push them off weaker hands that could pay me off, so calling allows me to keep their range wider while still protecting my hand.\n\n<invoke name=\"call\">\n<parameter name=\"reasoning\">Calling with AKs top pair top kicker.

This is a very strong hand that beats most possible holdings.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been mostly passive on flops (checking/calling), and I don't see any flop raises in their history. This 3x raise to 36 chips suggests either a very strong hand or a potential bluff.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 24 chips to win a pot that will be 94 chips (70 + 12 + 12), giving me about 4:1 odds.\n\n**Stack Considerations**: With 238 chips vs their 206, I have enough stack depth to make this call and continue playing based on the turn card.\n\n**Decision**: The combination of my strong hand, good pot odds, and the dry board texture makes calling the most appropriate action. If they have a stronger hand like AQ or a set, I'm still getting good odds to improve. If they're bluffing, I can potentially extract more value on later streets.\n\nThe raise is significant enough that raising back might push them off weaker hands that could pay me off, so calling allows me to keep their range wider while still protecting my hand.\n\n<invoke name=\"call\">\n<parameter name=\"reasoning\">Calling with AKs top pair top kicker.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ks As (top pair with top kicker, very strong)\n2. **Board**: 3s 6h Qc - relatively dry board, no obvious draws\n3. **Opponent**: Kimi-K2 Thinking just raised from 12 to 36 chips (3x my bet)\n4. **Pot**: 70 chips, I need to call 24 more to see the turn\n5. **My stack**: 238 chips (59.5 BB)\n6. **Opponent's stack**: 206 chips\n\nFrom the opponent history, I can see that Kimi-K2 Thinking has been quite passive on the flop - mostly checking and calling, with some small bets. I don't see any flop raises in their history, which suggests this could be a strong hand or a bluff.\n\nKey considerations:\n- AKs is a very strong hand, especially on this board\n- The raise to 36 is quite significant (3x my bet)\n- If they have a hand like AQ, KQ, or a set, I'm behind\n- If they're bluffing with air or weaker hands, I should continue\n- The board is dry, so there aren't many draws to worry about\n- I'm getting good pot odds to call: 24 to win 94 (70+12+12) = about 4:1\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have a very strong hand (top pair, top kicker)\n2. The board is dry and doesn't connect well with many hands\n3. The opponent hasn't shown this tendency to raise flops before\n4. I'm getting good pot odds\n5. My stack is healthy enough to absorb the call\n\nI think calling is the best option here. If they have a strong hand like AQ or a set, I'm still getting decent odds to see the turn and potentially improve. If they're bluffing, I can potentially extract more value later.\n\nRaising might be tempting but could push them off weaker hands that might pay me off if I just call and bet later streets.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have hand #26 preflop. Position CO (cutoff), stack 47 chips (11.8 BB). Blinds 2/4, so big blind is 4, small blind 2. Pot currently 14 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 8? Actually seat 2 posted sb 2, seat3 posted bb 4, seat4 raise 8, so raise from 4 to 8? Wait raise amount is 8 total, meaning raise to 8? Usually raise to 8 means total bet 8. So amount to call is 8, min raise to 12. So we need to decide fold/call/raise.\n\nOur hand: 6s Td (6 of spades, Ten of diamonds). Not a premium hand. In cutoff, with short stack (11.8 BB). Options: call 8 (which is 2 BB) to see flop, but stack is 47, after call we have 39 left. That's okay. However 6T is a marginal hand, not suited, not connected. Could be a steal attempt? But we are not the initial raiser; seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8. That is a small raise, about 2 BB. Might be a wide open raise from cutoff (since seat4 is button? Actually seat4 is position after us? Wait seats: seat1, seat2, seat3, seat4, seat5 (us). So seat4 is the player to our left? Actually positions: seat5 is CO, seat6 would be BTN (but only 5 seats?), maybe 5 players? Actually we have seats 1-5, so seat5 is CO, seat1 is UTG? Not sure. But seat4 is presumably the button (since seat5 is CO, seat4 is BTN). So button raised to 8. That is a standard open raise of 2 BB. So we face a raise from button. Our hand 6T is not a good call. With short stack we could consider going all-in (47) as a shove? That's too much compared to raise size. But we could also raise (shove) as a 3-bet all-in to steal blinds? However 6T is not a strong hand to 3-bet. But we have short stack; could be considered a push/fold strategy. At 12 BB effective stack, the push/fold chart suggests with 6T we might push from CO? Typically with 11.8 BB, push/fold ranges are fairly wide, but 6T off-suit is maybe marginal. Usually you push with any Ace, any pair, broadway combos, suited connectors, and maybe some suited one-gappers. Off-suit Ten-Six is usually not a push. So likely fold.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 raises small (4 BB) sometimes, but we have data: they raised 4 in previous hands (small). Could be a wide range. But still 6T off-suit is weak.\n\nThus best action: fold.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. So we choose fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

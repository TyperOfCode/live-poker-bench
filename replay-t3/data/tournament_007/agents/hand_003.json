Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) is playing aggressively with raises\n2. Seats 3, 4, and 5 have shown willingness to fold\n\nNow, analyzing my current situation:\n- Position: UTG (worst position, acting first)\n- Hand: 8d Kc (K8 offsuit)\n- Stack: 198 chips (99 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- To call: 2 chips\n\nK8 offsuit is a weak hand, especially from UTG. From early position, I should only be playing premium hands. K8o is easily dominated by better kings (AK, KQ, KJ, KT) and is vulnerable to many other hands.\n\nGiven:\n1. My hand strength: K8o is weak from UTG\n2. My position: UTG is the worst position - I'll be acting first on all streets\n3. Opponent tendencies: Seat 2 has been aggressive with raises, so there's a good chance I'll face a raise if I just call\n4. Tournament considerations: Early in tournament, I should be conservative and avoid marginal spots\n5. Pot odds: 2 to win 3 (1.5:1) - not great for a weak hand\n\nThe correct play is to fold this hand from UTG. I don't want to invest chips with a marginal hand out of position, especially against potentially aggressive opponents.",

This suggests they're not overly tight and might defend their blind.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has folded preflop in both previous hands when facing action. This suggests they might be tight or cautious.\n\nMy hand 6s 3h is terrible - unsuited, low cards, no straight potential, no high card strength. Even on the button, this is a clear fold in most situations. The only reason to play would be if I thought I could steal the blinds, but with two opponents left and such a weak hand, it's not worth it.\n\nPosition is good (button), but the hand is just too weak. Even if I raise, I'll likely get called by at least one blind, and then I'll be playing a very weak hand out of position postflop against a likely better hand.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win 3 chips (1.5:1), but that's only if both blinds fold, which is unlikely. If I raise, I'd be putting in more chips with a very weak hand.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (98.5 BB), so no need to take unnecessary risks with trash hands. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies and my hand strength, this is an easy fold. I should wait for a better hand to play from the button.\n\nResponse: {\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"6s 3h is too weak even on the button.

This gives me:\n- One ten (but there's a Tc on board, so I don't have top pair)\n- Straight potential (I could make a straight with 4, 6, 7, or 9)\n- Flush potential with spades\n- The board shows paired fives, making full houses and quads possible\n\n**Situation assessment:**\n- I'm on the button with positional advantage\n- The opponent checked to me on the turn (amount to call = 0)\n- This could indicate weakness, medium strength, or a trap\n- Pot is 8 chips, giving me good pot odds to bet\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nWith 203 chips (101.5 BB), I have a healthy stack and can afford to be somewhat aggressive to build it up further. The minimum raise to 2 chips is very reasonable given the pot size.\n\n**Decision reasoning:**\nGiven my positional advantage, the checked opportunity, and the fact that I have some equity with straight/flush draws and a ten kicker, I should bet to:\n1. Win the pot immediately if opponent has a weak hand\n2. Build the pot if I have the best hand\n3. Get information about opponent's hand strength\n4. Maintain aggression in position\n\nThe minimum raise of 2 chips gives me good value and keeps the risk low while still being effective.\n",

The minimum raise would be to 2 chips.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have Ts 8s - this is a suited connector with some potential\n- The board is 5c 5h 3s Tc\n- There's a pair of fives on the board\n- I have a ten in my hand, but there's also a ten on the board (Tc), so I only have one ten\n- I have the 8s, which gives me some straight and flush potential\n- With the board having 5-5-3-Tc, I could potentially have:\n  - A full house if the opponent has a 5\n  - Quads if I had another 5 (which I don't)\n  - A straight if I had 4, 6, 7, or 9 (I have 8)\n  - A flush if two more spades come\n  - Trips if another T comes (but I only have one T)\n\n**Position and opponent analysis:**\nSince I don't have much history on GPT-OSS-120B, I need to make a general assessment. In this position as the button, I have positional advantage. The opponent checked to me on the turn, which could indicate:\n1. They have a weak hand and are checking for pot control\n2. They have a medium-strength hand and want to see what I do\n3. They have a strong hand and are trying to trap\n\n**Pot odds and tournament considerations:**\n- The pot is 8 chips\n- If I bet 2 chips (minimum raise), I'm risking 2 to win 8\n\n\n- I'm considering my stack depth carefully\n- With 203 chips, I have significant room to maneuver\n- The blinds are low, giving me strategic flexibility\n- I can explore betting options without significant risk\n\n**Betting strategy:**\n- A small 2-chip bet seems reasonable\n- It provides information about the opponent's hand\n- Low cost to potentially win the pot\n- Keeps me in control of the hand's progression\n",

So odds ~ 2/8 = 25% needed to break even. Our equity with K7 off-suit vs unknown range? Probably less than 25% unless we have some draws. We have no draw, just showdown value: maybe we have K high, could win if opponent has low cards like 2-6 combos? But board is paired 5s, opponent could have 5 for set, but they'd bet bigger.

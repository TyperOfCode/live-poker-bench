            "reasoning_content": "  Good, I have some information about GPT-OSS-120B's playing style:\n\n1. **Frequently folds preflop** - In 13 recorded actions, 6 were preflop folds\n2. **Generally passive** - Only 1 preflop raise in hand #7 (8 chips)\n3. **Can call small bets** - Called 1 chip in hand #4, called 2 on flop in hand #3\n4. **Often gives up on later streets** - Folded on turn in hands #3 and #4\n\nNow let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**My hand: 9s 8c** - This is a suited connector (though not suited in this case, 9s 8c are different suits). It's a decent speculative hand that can make straights and two pairs, but it's not particularly strong preflop.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. I get to act last on every street.\n\n**Stack**: 223 chips (111.5 BB) - Healthy stack\n\n**Current action**: \n- Blinds are 1/2\n- Pot is 4 chips\n- Everyone folded to SB (Seat 5) who just called 1 (completing the small blind)\n- I posted BB of 2\n- Amount to call is 0 (I can check)\n\n**Pot odds**: If I check, I see a flop for free with 4 chips in the pot.\n\n**Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B is in the SB and just called. Based on their history, this could mean:\n- They have a marginal hand they want to see cheaply\n- They have a decent hand but are playing passively\n- They're trying to trap (less likely given their passive nature)\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 9s 8c is marginal but playable, especially in position\n2. **Position**: Excellent (on the button)\n3. **Pot odds**: Great - I can see the flop for free\n4. **Stack preservation**: Checking risks nothing\n5. **Opponent tendency**: They're passive, so checking is unlikely to induce aggression\n\n**Options**:\n- **Check**: See the flop for free, evaluate from there. Zero risk.\n- **Raise**: Try to win the pot preflop. Minimum raise is to 4 (2 more chips). Given opponent's passivity, they might fold. But if they call, I'm out of position with a marginal hand.\n- **Fold**: Not an option since I can check for free.\n\nSince I can see the flop for free and I'm in position with a speculative hand, checking is the clear best option. There's no need to risk chips preflop with 9s 8c when I can evaluate the flop texture and act with full information.\n\nI should check and see the flop.",

They've checked both flop and turn, showing weakness.\n\n**Position and Pot:**\n- I'm on the button (best position)\n- Pot is very small (4 chips)\n- I can check for free\n\n**Decision:**\nI have complete air (9-high). While I could try to bluff this passive opponent, the risk/reward isn't great:\n- The pot is tiny (4 chips)\n- Bluffing would risk chips with 9-high\n- The opponent has shown passivity but could be trapping with a monster\n- With no equity, no draw, and a passive opponent, checking is the correct play\n- I should preserve my chips for better spots\n\nWhile the opponent has been passive, bluffing with 9-high into a dry board with two 4s isn't a good play. The opponent could easily have a King or Jack and be slow-playing, or they could have a 4. Checking costs nothing and I can see the river card for free.",

The board has a pair of 4s. So I have two pair: 8s and 4s.\n\n**Pot:** 4 chips\n**Opponent:** GPT-OSS-120B who has been passive\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent actions, GPT-OSS-120B has been:\n- Mostly folding preflop (hands 5, 6, 8)\n- When they do play, they tend to check and fold later (hands 3, 4)\n- They did make one preflop raise in hand 7\n- Overall, they seem to be a relatively tight/passive player\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nThe board is Kh Js 4c 4h 8s\n- There are two pair on board: 4s and 4s (pair of 4s)\n- I have 9s 8c, so I have a pair of 8s\n- This gives me two pair: 8s and 4s\n- Possible hands that beat me:\n  - Any hand with a K (top pair), J, or 9 would give them a higher two pair\n  - Any hand with a 4 would give them trips (444)\n  - KJ would give them two pair (Kings and Jacks)\n  - Any pocket pair higher than 8s would give them a higher two pair\n\n**River Action:**\nOpponent checked to me. The pot is small (4 chips). I have a decent but not strong hand (two pair with 8s and 4s).\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: I have two pair (8s and 4s), which is decent but vulnerable\n2. **Opponent**: Seems tight/passive based on history - they likely have something when they check\n3. **Pot size**: Very small (4 chips)\n4. **Position**: I'm on the button, last to act\n5. **Board texture**: Paired board with high cards (K, J) - many hands could beat me\n\n**Options:**\n- Check: Showdown for free, see if my two pair is good\n- Bet: Try to get value from weaker hands, but risk getting called/raised by better hands\n\nGiven that the opponent has been passive and checked on the river, they likely have a marginal hand or are giving up. However, the board is somewhat scary with two pair and high cards.\n\nWith a small pot and a decent but not strong hand, checking seems appropriate. I don't want to build a bigger pot with a vulnerable hand against a passive opponent who might be trapping with a better hand.\n\nLet me check if there's any additional information I should consider...",

Even if I hit the flop, I often have a weak hand that's difficult to play well. Given that I've been folding weak hands from the button (as shown in my recent history), I should continue that pattern.\n\nThe risk of building a pot with this weak hand outweighs the potential reward of hitting a miracle flop.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2d 8d is too weak to play profitably even with position and decent pot odds.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. My hand: 2d 8d - This is a very weak suited connector, essentially a garbage hand\n2. Position: Button (BTN) - This is the best position, but my hand is too weak to take advantage\n3. Stack: 188 chips (94 BB) - Healthy stack\n4. Current situation: I need to call 2 chips to see the flop\n5. Opponents: Looking at recent history, I see:\n   - Kimi-K2 and Kimi-K2 Thinking have been folding frequently preflop\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 6 chips in hand #8\n   - GPT-OSS-120B raised to 8 chips in hand #7\n\nThe key factors:\n- My hand (2d 8d) is extremely weak - bottom of the range\n- I'm getting good pot odds (2:1 to call)\n- I'm in position, which gives me information post-flop\n- The blinds are only 1/2, so I'm not risking much\n- My recent button play shows I've been folding weak hands\n\nHowever, 2d 8d is so weak that even with position and good odds, it's not profitable to play. This hand has very little equity against any reasonable range, and even if I hit something, it's likely to be dominated or give me a weak hand that's hard to play.\n\nGiven my weak hand and the fact that I can see the flop for just 2 chips, this might be worth a small call to try to hit a monster, but realistically, 2d 8d is foldable even in position.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The pot is offering me 3:1 odds (I need to call 2 to win 6 total - the 3 already in pot plus the 2 I call). But 2d 8d has terrible equity against any reasonable range. Even if someone has a random hand, 2d 8d only wins about 35% of the time.\n \nI'll strategically fold. Despite the attractive pot odds, the hand's poor equity and minimal winning potential make it an unprofitable play. The risk outweighs the potential reward, especially given the weak starting hand and limited post-flop advantages.",

The actions: seat5 post_sb 1 (so seat5 is SB?), seat1 post_bb 2 (so seat1 is BB). Wait our position is BB (Seat5). But actions show seat5 posted SB 1, seat1 posted BB 2. That seems contradictory: maybe seat5 is SB (small blind) and seat1 is BB (big blind). However the description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So seat5 is BB, but they posted SB 1. Might be a mistake. Anyway we are in BB with As5h, after blinds posted, we face amount to call = 1 (so the SB posted 1, we posted 2 as BB, now we need to call 1 to match BB? Actually amount to call is 1 meaning the SB posted 1 and we posted 2, but the BB is already 2, so the amount to call is the SB's 1? Usually after blinds, the action is on UTG, but here only players left are seat1 (BB) and seat5 (SB). Wait seat2-4 folded. So only SB and BB remain. SB posted 1, BB posted 2. The action is on the SB (seat5) first preflop, they can check (i.e., just call 1 to match BB) or raise. The amount to call is 1 (i.e., they need to put 1 more to match the BB). So we are the SB (actually). But position says BB; but we treat as SB.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise total to 4 chips). So raise amount would be 4 total (so additional 3). Our hand As5h is weak unsuited Ace low kicker. In SB vs BB heads-up, typical play: you can raise or call. With A5 offsuit, it's marginal. Considering stack 97 BB deep, can we steal? The BB might fold many times? The BB is Kimi-K2 Thinking. We have recall: they raised preflop in hand #5 (previous hand) to amount 6 (maybe from SB to BB?). That indicates they may be aggressive. But we only have one data point.\n\nWe should consider tournament stage: early, stacks deep. We have Ace high, but not strong. Probably best to call (just see flop) rather than raise and risk. Since amount to call is just 1, calling is cheap. So action: call.\n\nThus output JSON: action call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Action so far: preflop small blind 1, big blind 2, both checked. No betting on flop, turn, river. So we are at river with 0 to call, can check or raise. What is hand strength? Our hand As 5h. Board: K hearts? Actually board: Kh (heart), Js (spade), 4c, 4h, 8s. So we have Ace high, plus a 5. No pair, no straight draws. Opponent could have many hands: any pair like Kx, Jx, 4x, 8x, maybe two pair, sets, etc. Our hand is weak. We could try a bluff? But pot is tiny 4 chips. Raising minimal 2 chips (to total 2?) Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Minimum raise to 2 (meaning we need to put 2 chips total? Since amount to call is 0, raise to 2 means bet 2 chips). That's a small bet, about half pot. Could be a thin value bet if we think opponent has worse Ace high? But opponent could have any Ace low, but board has no Ace, so opponent could also have Ace high. Our Ace is high, but opponent could have Ace with kicker better than 5. So value bet unlikely.\n\nBetter to check and fold if opponent bets later? But we have no more actions after river; if we check, hand ends, we lose if opponent shows better. Since we have weak hand, checking is safe. Could we try a bluff raise to 2 chips to steal? Opponent might call with any hand, but given pot 4, they might call with any Ace or any decent hand. But they also could fold many hands. However, they have 223 chips, tournament early? Not sure. Probably better to check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

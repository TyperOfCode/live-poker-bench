            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 8d Kh - King-high, offsuit, decent but not premium. K8o is a marginal hand.\n\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - Excellent position, last to act postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 200 chips (50 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Pot:** 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 206 chips - Has been relatively tight, folding many hands preflop. Did raise in hand #22 and #30.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 231 chips - Very tight, folding most preflop. Only called once in hand #27 then folded.\n\n**Observations:**\n- Both opponents have been playing tight, especially the BB\n- SB has shown some aggression with raises in hands #22 and #30\n- I have position advantage on both players\n- Pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1) which is not great for a marginal hand\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength:** K8o is marginal, dominated by better Kx hands\n2. **Position:** Excellent on the button\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** Both seem tight, making stealing profitable\n4. **Stack sizes:** Healthy, can afford to see a flop\n5. **Tournament:** Still early(ish) with 50BB stacks\n\nI should consider raising to steal the blinds from these tight players, especially with position. A standard raise would be 3x BB = 12 chips. However, calling is also reasonable given the position and the fact that I'm getting 1.5:1 on my money against potentially weak ranges.\n\nLet me think about the best play:\n- **Fold:** Too tight from the button with K8o against tight blinds\n- **Call:** Reasonable, see a flop in position, but K8o can be problematic\n- **Raise:** Good for stealing, puts pressure on tight players\n\nGiven that both opponents fold a lot preflop (especially the BB who has folded 8/10 recent hands), a raise seems profitable. I'll raise to 12 chips (3x BB) as a standard steal attempt.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking more carefully:\n- The SB has been more active with raises in hands #22 and #30\n- The BB is extremely tight, folding 9/10 recent hands\n- My hand K8o is weak but playable in position\n- If I raise and get called, I'll be out of position postflop (wait no, I'm on the button so I'll have position)\n\nActually, I have position on both players since I'm on the button. Let me recalculate:\n- Seat 1: Me (BTN) - position is last to act postflop\n- Seat 2: SB - acts first postflop\n- Seat 3: BB - acts second postflop\n\nSo I have position advantage on both players.\n\nGiven the tightness of both opponents, a raise seems like the best play. I'll make it 12 chips (3x BB) as a standard steal size.\n\nWait, let me think about the minimum raise amount. The minimum raise to is 8, which means I can raise to 8 total (adding 4 more chips). But a standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 12 chips total. Let me raise to 12.\n\nActually, looking at the data again, the SB has shown aggression. If I raise and the SB comes back with a re-raise, I should be prepared to fold K8o. But the likelihood of both players folding to a button raise given their tight stats is high enough to make this profitable.\n\nFinal decision: Raise to 12 chips as a steal attempt against two tight players.",

I already posted 4 chips as BB, so I need to call 8 more chips. Pot is currently 18 (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 12). \n\nFrom the opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 actions were folds). They raised once in hand #30 (to 8, which is 2x BB) and then folded when facing action. They called once in hand #26 and then raised on the flop. This suggests they might be somewhat tight but occasionally aggressive.\n\nMy hand Qd 3s is very weak - Q3o is a trash hand. I'm out of position (BB vs UTG raiser). I have 57.8 BB stack, which is healthy. The pot odds: I need to call 8 to win 18, which is about 2.25:1 or 31% equity needed.\n\nQ3o has very little equity against a UTG raising range. Even against a wide range, it's probably around 25-30% equity at best. Against a tight range, it's much worse.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack (231 chips, 57.8 BB). No need to take marginal spots. Being out of position with a weak hand makes this an easy fold.\n\nThe opponent's raise size is 12 (3x BB), which is a standard raise. Their history shows they're fairly tight, so their range is likely stronger.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot. Folding preserves my stack.\n\nLet me check if there are any other relevant factors... The other players folded, so it's heads-up between me and Kimi-K2 Thinking. I'm in the BB, so I've already invested 4 chips, but that's a sunk cost.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

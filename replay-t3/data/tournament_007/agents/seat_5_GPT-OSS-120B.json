So odds ~ 2/8 = 25% needed to break even. Our equity with K7 off-suit vs unknown range? Probably less than 25% unless we have some draws. We have no draw, just showdown value: maybe we have K high, could win if opponent has low cards like 2-6 combos? But board is paired 5s, opponent could have 5 for set, but they'd bet bigger. Small bet suggests maybe they are probing with air or medium hand.\n\nGiven tournament, stack 99 BB, not huge pressure. Might consider calling to see turn cheap, but risk losing chips.

With K7, we have gutshot? 5-5-3-10, need 9 for 9-10-J-Q-K? Not. Need 8 for 8-9-10-J-Q? Not. So no draw. Opponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) bet 2 into pot 10, so pot now 12 after bet? Actually before turn bet: pot was 10 (preflop and flop). Flop: seat4 bet 2, seat5 called 2 => pot 14. Turn: seat4 bets 2, amount to call 2, pot currently 14+2? Actually after flop pot 14. Turn bet 2 adds to pot 2, making pot 16 (including bet). To call 2 adds 2, making pot 18. So pot odds: call 2 to win 16? Actually if call, you get to win pot of 16 (current pot before call) + opponent's bet 2? Let's compute: pot before turn action = 14. Opponent bets 2, so pot becomes 16 (including his bet). You need to call 2 to win 16. So pot odds = 2/(16+2?) Wait you call 2 to win 16 (the opponent's bet is already in pot). So you invest 2 to win 16, odds 1:8. Need ~11% equity. But you have essentially zero equity (no pair). So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: maybe they are aggressive? Could be bluff?

Actually seat5 is us (BB). But actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 1 (so we are SB? But position says BB seat5. Possibly they treat seat5 as SB posting 1, then seat1 post_bb 2. So we are SB? Confusing. But amount to call is 1, meaning we need to call the big blind? Actually after SB posted 1, BB posted 2. Now it's our turn? Actually if we are BB, after posting BB we act first preflop? No, SB acts first, then BB, then UTG, etc. But all others folded. So after SB posted 1, BB posted 2, now it's our turn to act? Actually BB is seat5, we already posted 2, but we can raise or check (since we are already in blind). The amount to call is 1 (to call the SB's 1? But we already have 2, which is more than 1, so we could check (i.e., just continue) or raise. Legal actions include fold, call, raise. \"call\" would mean call the additional 1 to match the SB? That seems odd. Usually you can check (i.e., just continue) if no raise. But they give call as legal. So likely they treat that we need to call the SB's 1 to stay in the hand (i.e., we have posted BB 2, but we need to call the SB's 1? Actually we are already over the amount, but maybe they treat the BB as already posted and we can check. But they gave call as option. In any case, with 3h5d, we should fold or just call? Typically you'd just check (i.e., do nothing) because it's a dead blind. But they don't have check as legal action, only fold, call, raise. So \"call\" likely means just check (i.e., match the current bet). Since we are already over, call is just check. So we should call (i.e., check) rather than fold because it's a cheap hand and we can see flop cheap. But 3h5d is very weak, but still you can call the 1 to see flop for cheap. In tournament, with 97.5 BB, you could fold and preserve stack. But folding a BB blind loses 2 anyway. So you might as well call the 1 and see flop. However, 3h5d is low, but you could also raise to try to steal? Not advisable. So best: call.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Our hand: we have a pair of fives (pair on board? board has 5c, we have 5d, so we have a pair of fives, plus a backdoor flush draw? Actually we have 3h and 5d, board hearts Jd Ah 7h 5c, we have 3h gives us two hearts (3h + board hearts Jd Ah 7h). That's three hearts total: J\u2665, A\u2665, 7\u2665, plus our 3\u2665 = four hearts? Wait board hearts: Jd is diamonds, Ah is hearts, 7h is hearts, 5c is clubs. So hearts on board: Ah, 7h. Our 3h gives us three hearts total (Ah,7h,3h). That's a flush draw? Need 5 hearts for flush. So we have 3 hearts, need two more hearts on river, not possible. Actually flush draw needs 4 of same suit on board? Wait we have 3 hearts total (two on board, one in hand). That's 3 hearts. Need 5 hearts total for flush, so need two more hearts on river, impossible. So no flush draw.\n\nWe have pair of fives, but board also has J and A. Opponent (Seat1) bet 2 into pot 6. Pot before bet: 6 chips (includes blinds and calls). He bets 2, making pot 8 now (plus his bet). Effective stack: both have ~194 chips, deep. He bets small.\n\nWe need to consider opponent's range. Seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (maybe a thoughtful player). Preflop he posted BB 2, we called 1 (small blind). So we are in BB, he is UTG? Actually seat1 is SB? Wait seats: Seat5 is BB, Seat1 is SB? Actually blinds: 1/2, seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB (since seat5 posted SB 1 earlier? Actually preflop actions: Seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. Wait seat5 is BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\" but actions show seat5 posted SB 1, seat1 posted BB 2. So maybe seat5 is SB but they call it BB? Might be a mistake. But we are in small blind with 3h5d. Opponent is big blind.\n\nThus preflop: we called 1, opponent checked. Flop: both check. Turn: we check, opponent bets 2 (small bet). So maybe he is probing with weak hand or drawing.\n\nOur hand: 5 pair is weak, but could be best if opponent has missed. Board: J A 7 5. Potential opponent ranges: could have Ace, Jack, pair, straight draws (like 9T for open-ended? board: J A 7 5, straight draws: 9T gives 9-10, not there. Actually possible straight: 9T gives 9-10-J-Q? No. Board has J, A,7,5. Straight combos: 8-9-10? Not there. So limited straight. Could have a set of J or A? No, board has only one J and one A. He could have J? Pair of J? He could have AJ for two pair, but board already has A and J, so AJ gives two pair. He could have KQ for gutshot? Not.\n\nHe could have a hand like KQ for gutshot to 9? Not.\n\nHe could be betting with overpairs? No overpair to board: board top is A, so overpair would be AA, KK. But AA is impossible because board has Ace, but could have pocket Aces? Actually board has Ace of hearts, so opponent could have Ace of spades, Ace of clubs (AA). That would be set of Aces? Actually board Ace plus two pocket Aces gives trips (three of a kind). That's strong. He could have AJ for two pair, also strong. Could have KJ for pair of J with kicker, etc.\n\nBut his bet is small (2 into pot 6). That suggests a weak hand or a probe. Our hand is weak; we likely should fold unless we think he is bluffing.\n\nConsider pot odds: call 2 to win pot of 8 (current pot after bet includes his bet? Actually pot before bet was 6, he bets 2, so total pot now is 8 (including his bet). To call 2 to win 8, pot odds 2.5:1, about 28.6% equity"

AsJs is a strong hand but not top; raising to 4 (3BB) might get many callers. Raising to 8 may be okay. Let's raise to 8.\n\nReturn JSON.",

The actions: seat5 post_sb 1 (so seat5 is SB?), seat1 post_bb 2 (so seat1 is BB). Wait our position is BB (Seat5). But actions show seat5 posted SB 1, seat1 posted BB 2. That seems contradictory: maybe seat5 is SB (small blind) and seat1 is BB (big blind). However the description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So seat5 is BB, but they posted SB 1. Might be a mistake. Anyway we are in BB with As5h, after blinds posted, we face amount to call = 1 (so the SB posted 1, we posted 2 as BB, now we need to call 1 to match BB? Actually amount to call is 1 meaning the SB posted 1 and we posted 2, but the BB is already 2, so the amount to call is the SB's 1? Usually after blinds, the action is on UTG, but here only players left are seat1 (BB) and seat5 (SB). Wait seat2-4 folded. So only SB and BB remain. SB posted 1, BB posted 2. The action is on the SB (seat5) first preflop, they can check (i.e., just call 1 to match BB) or raise. The amount to call is 1 (i.e., they need to put 1 more to match the BB). So we are the SB (actually). But position says BB; but we treat as SB.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise total to 4 chips). So raise amount would be 4 total (so additional 3). Our hand As5h is weak unsuited Ace low kicker. In SB vs BB heads-up, typical play: you can raise or call. With A5 offsuit, it's marginal. Considering stack 97 BB deep, can we steal? The BB might fold many times? The BB is Kimi-K2 Thinking. We have recall: they raised preflop in hand #5 (previous hand) to amount 6 (maybe from SB to BB?). That indicates they may be aggressive. But we only have one data point.\n\nWe should consider tournament stage: early, stacks deep. We have Ace high, but not strong. Probably best to call (just see flop) rather than raise and risk. Since amount to call is just 1, calling is cheap. So action: call.\n\nThus output JSON: action call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Action so far: preflop small blind 1, big blind 2, both checked. No betting on flop, turn, river. So we are at river with 0 to call, can check or raise. What is hand strength? Our hand As 5h. Board: K hearts? Actually board: Kh (heart), Js (spade), 4c, 4h, 8s. So we have Ace high, plus a 5. No pair, no straight draws. Opponent could have many hands: any pair like Kx, Jx, 4x, 8x, maybe two pair, sets, etc. Our hand is weak. We could try a bluff? But pot is tiny 4 chips. Raising minimal 2 chips (to total 2?) Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Minimum raise to 2 (meaning we need to put 2 chips total? Since amount to call is 0, raise to 2 means bet 2 chips). That's a small bet, about half pot. Could be a thin value bet if we think opponent has worse Ace high? But opponent could have any Ace low, but board has no Ace, so opponent could also have Ace high. Our Ace is high, but opponent could have Ace with kicker better than 5. So value bet unlikely.\n\nBetter to check and fold if opponent bets later? But we have no more actions after river; if we check, hand ends, we lose if opponent shows better. Since we have weak hand, checking is safe. Could we try a bluff raise to 2 chips to steal? Opponent might call with any hand, but given pot 4, they might call with any Ace or any decent hand. But they also could fold many hands. However, they have 223 chips, tournament early? Not sure.

Usually order: SB seat4, BB seat5, then seat1 UTG, seat2, seat3, etc. But given seat1 and seat2 folded, seat3 raised. So we face a raise of 6, need to call 4.\n\nOur hand: 7h Th. It's a decent suited connector, decent potential for straight and flush, but not premium. Stack 194 chips ~97 BB, deep. Facing a raise of 3BB from presumably early position (maybe middle). We need to decide.\n\nWe should consider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 raised 6 previously (hand #8). Might be a standard raise range. We could call to see flop, but also could raise (3-bet) as a semi-bluff? 7hTh is not a strong 3-bet hand; could 3-bet for value vs weaker range? Probably not advisable. Better to call and see flop, especially with deep stack.\n\nBut also consider position: we are in BB, out of position post-flop. However, 7hTh is a decent hand to call in BB vs a raise from early position? Might be borderline. In tournaments early stage (blinds 1/2, stack 97 BB), we can be more liberal. The raise is 3BB, not huge. So calling is fine.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nWe must ensure raise_to is null.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

So we have a pair of tens, plus a straight draw? 7-8-9-10? No board has 2,2,T. So we have a pair of tens, kicker 7. Not great but top pair. Opponent (Seat3) raised preflop to 6 (from UTG maybe). He is DeepSeek-V3.2. We called. Now flop with pair on board: 2-2-T. He hasn't acted yet? The actions list only includes preflop. So now it's our turn (BB) after flop? Actually order: In flop, action starts with UTG (Seat3) then Seat4 (fold) then Seat5 (BB) etc. Since Seat3 raised preflop and we called, now flop action is first to act UTG (Seat3). The action list doesn't show any flop actions yet; it's our turn? Usually after flop, action starts with UTG (first active player left of button). That is Seat3. Since no flop actions listed, it's currently Seat3's turn? But the prompt says \"Your Position: BB (Seat5)\". And \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests it's our turn to act and nothing to call (i.e., previous player checked). So the opponent must have checked the flop. So we have the option to check or raise. We have top pair, decent hand. Opponent's tendencies unknown. Let's recall opponent actions on flop. Use recall_opponent_actions again for preflop maybe? But we can infer that he raised preflop and now checked flop. Could be a continuation bet? He didn't bet. So maybe he missed the flop, so checking suggests a weak hand. Could be a trap? But likely he's weak. So we could consider raising to protect our hand and extract value. Our stack is 190 chips, pot 13. Minimum raise is 4, meaning we can raise to 4 total? Actually raise to 4 means total bet of 4? Minimum raise to: 4 meaning we must put at least 4 chips total (i.e., raise 4). Since amount to call 0, raising to 4 would be a bet of 4 chips. That's small. Could we raise larger? Yes, we can raise any amount above min raise. We could bet maybe 8-10 chips to protect and get value. Opponent's stack 188, pot 13. A bet of say 8 would be about 1.5 BB. Might be fine.\n\nConsider tournament stage: early, stacks 95 BB, we can be aggressive. Opponent raised preflop, maybe strong. But flop is dry with 2-2-T. Our T is top pair, but opponent could have T with stronger kicker (like AJ, QJ, etc.) or a set of twos (unlikely). Also could have overcards like AK. But he checked, maybe he missed. So raising is good.\n\nThus action: raise to maybe 8 chips. Provide reasoning.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise allowed. So output JSON.\n\n",

Then we call 4 more (to match 6). So total contributions: SB 1, BB 2+4=6, opponent 6. So pot = 13. Flop bet 8 from us, opponent called 8. So pot now 13+8+8=29 (as given).

          "content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: BB with 7h Th. Board: 2d 2c Tc 4s. So we have top pair (Tens) with a gutshot? Actually board has pair of deuces, we have Ten, so we have pair of tens, plus a flush draw? Suits: board: 2d,2c,Tc,4s. Our hand: 7h Th. So we have pair of tens, kicker 7. Potential: we have set? No. Overpair? Not overpair, it's pair. Straight possibilities: board has 2-2- T-4. We have 7, could get straight draw with 8-9? Not currently. So only pair.\n\nOpponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised preflop to 6 (from UTG maybe). We called with 7h Th from BB. Flop 2d 2c Tc: we bet 8, opponent called 8. So flop we led out, maybe representing strong. Opponent called.\n\nTurn 4s: we check, opponent bets 18 into pot 47? Actually pot after flop: preflop pot: 1+2+6+4 =13? Wait: preflop: SB 1, BB 2, raise 6, call 4 => total 1+2+6+4 =13? Actually raise to 6 includes the 2 from BB? No, raise 6 means total 6? Usually raise to 6 after SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6 from seat3, call 4 from seat5 (BB). So pot after preflop: 1+2+6+4 =13.\n\nFlop: we bet 8, opponent call 8 => pot now 13+8+8 =29. Turn: we check, opponent bets 18 => pot becomes 29+18 =47 (as given). So we need to decide.\n\nOur hand: top pair (tens) with weak kicker. Opponent's range: preflop raise from UTG (likely strong). They called flop bet, maybe they have T? Could be 2 pair (2s with T), set of 2s, or maybe a straight draw (like 9J, 8J, etc). Turn card 4s gives them maybe a flush draw? No spades: only 4s, we have no spades. So they could have a flush draw with spades? Actually board spade only 4s. They could have two spades in hand, giving flush draw. Not many combos.\n\nOur check might be considered weak; opponent bets. Should we call? Evaluate pot odds: pot 47, bet 18, so total pot after call 65. Need to call 18 to win 65 => odds 18/65 = 27.7%. Need equity >27.7%. Our hand vs opponent's range.\n\nWhat could opponent have? Since they raised preflop UTG, likely strong: high pairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT), AK, AQ, maybe A2s? They called flop bet, indicating they have decent hand or draw. Board: 2d 2c Tc. Our bet on flop could have been with T, we have T. Opponent may have 2x for set, or T? Could have overpair (AA, KK) that still call? Overpairs would call a small bet. Could also have straight draw like 9J (gives open-ended) or 8J? Actually board T,2,2. 9J gives gutshot? 9J would need 8 or Q for straight. Not immediate.\n\nTurn 4s: board now 2-2-T-4. This gives potential for a straight 3-4-5-6? Not relevant.\n\nOpponent bet 18, maybe representing a made hand like set of 2s, two pair (T2), or maybe a bluff.\n\nOur hand is weak top pair. Likely behind many of opponent's strong hands.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: BB with 7h Th. Board: 2d 2c Tc 4s. So we have top pair (Tens) with a gutshot? Actually board has pair of deuces, we have Ten, so we have pair of tens, plus a flush draw? Suits: board: 2d,2c,Tc,4s. Our hand: 7h Th. So we have pair of tens, kicker 7. Potential: we have set? No. Overpair? Not overpair, it's pair. Straight possibilities: board has 2-2- T-4. We have 7, could get straight draw with 8-9? Not currently. So only pair.\n\nOpponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised preflop to 6 (from UTG maybe). We called with 7h Th from BB. Flop 2d 2c Tc: we bet 8, opponent called 8. So flop we led out, maybe representing strong. Opponent called.\n\nTurn 4s: we check, opponent bets 18 into pot 47? Actually pot after flop: preflop pot: 1+2+6+4 =13? Wait: preflop: SB 1, BB 2, raise 6, call 4 => total 1+2+6+4 =13? Actually raise to 6 includes the 2 from BB? No, raise 6 means total 6? Usually raise to 6 after SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6 from seat3, call 4 from seat5 (BB). So pot after preflop: 1+2+6+4 =13.\n\nFlop: we bet 8, opponent call 8 => pot now 13+8+8 =29. Turn: we check, opponent bets 18 => pot becomes 29+18 =47 (as given). So we need to decide.\n\nOur hand: top pair (tens) with weak kicker. Opponent's range: preflop raise from UTG (likely strong). They called flop bet, maybe they have T? Could be 2 pair (2s with T), set of 2s, or maybe a straight draw (like 9J, 8J, etc). Turn card 4s gives them maybe a flush draw? No spades: only 4s, we have no spades. So they could have a flush draw with spades? Actually board spade only 4s. They could have two spades in hand, giving flush draw. Not many combos.\n\nOur check might be considered weak; opponent bets. Should we call? Evaluate pot odds: pot 47, bet 18, so total pot after call 65. Need to call 18 to win 65 => odds 18/65 = 27.7%. Need equity >27.7%. Our hand vs opponent's range.\n\nWhat could opponent have? Since they raised preflop UTG, likely strong: high pairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT), AK, AQ, maybe A2s? They called flop bet, indicating they have decent hand or draw. Board: 2d 2c Tc. Our bet on flop could have been with T, we have T. Opponent may have 2x for set, or T? Could have overpair (AA, KK) that still call? Overpairs would call a small bet. Could also have straight draw like 9J (gives open-ended) or 8J? Actually board T,2,2. 9J gives gutshot? 9J would need 8 or Q for straight. Not immediate.\n\nTurn 4s: board now 2-2-T-4. This gives potential for a straight 3-4-5-6? Not relevant.\n\nOpponent bet 18, maybe representing a made hand like set of 2s, two pair (T2), or maybe a bluff.\n\nOur hand is weak top pair. Likely behind many of opponent's strong hands. But also many draws (flush draw spades, straight draws). Should we call? With 7h Th, we have backdoor flush? No hearts on board. Not.\n\nWe could raise? Minimum raise to 36, raising to 36 would be +18 extra. Does that make sense? Probably not.\n\nWe could fold to preserve stack. Our stack 182, still decent.\n\nGiven we have only top pair with weak kicker, and opponent's range is likely ahead, folding seems appropriate.\n\nBut we need to consider possibility opponent is semi-bluffing with spade flush draw.

We have only 6, need 8 and 9. With J we can make straight 7-8-9-10-J need 8 and 9. So we have open-ended straight draw? Actually we have two outs combos: 8 and 9 both needed. That's a \"double gutshot\"? Let's evaluate: we have 6 and J, board 7, T, Q. The possible straight combos: 8-9 give straight 7-8-9-10-J (needs both 8 and 9). That's a double gutshot (needs two specific ranks). Also 8 gives 6-7-8-9-10? Wait need 8 and 9 for that too. So we need both 8 and 9. That's not a typical open-ended; it's a \"two-card combo\" draw (needs both of two ranks). So it's weaker. Also we have a flush draw? We have 6h and board has 7h, so we have two hearts, need two more hearts for flush (needs turn and river hearts). So we have backdoor flush draw.\n\nOur stack 179 chips, pot 6. Opponents (seat1 K1) and seat2 K2 (small blind and big blind) both checked. So we are first to act on BTN after checks. We have a weak draw. Should we check or bet? Consider pot odds: we can check and see if they bet. If they bet, we can call maybe. But we have limited stack; but still many chips.\n\nOpponent tendencies: K2 sometimes folds on flop, sometimes calls. Not much info. K1 also check. Likely they have weak hands.\n\nGiven we have a draw, maybe a small bet to take pot? But we have only 6 pot, minimum raise is 2 (so bet 2). That would be 2 into 6 = 33% pot, decent. Could try to steal? But they are in blinds, they might have decent hand like QJ, AQ, etc. Our hand is not strong. Betting could get us folds from weak, but we could also be called and we are behind.\n\nCheck is safe, we can see turn. Since we have a weak draw, we may want to see free card. So checking seems appropriate.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

Actually we have a gutshot straight draw: need 8 or 9 to complete straight? Let's evaluate: Our hole cards 6 and J. The board: 7, T, Q, 7. So we have 6-7-8-9-10? Not possible. We have 6-7-8-9-10? Need 8 and 9, we have only 6 and J. So no. We have a backdoor flush draw? We have 6h, board has 7h, 7s, Qs, Th. There's one heart on board (7h).

So we have no draw. So we have basically nothing. The board currently: pair of 7s, plus Q and T.

Check.\n\nBut we might consider a bluff? Opponents are Kimi-K2 seat1 and seat2. Both have stacks: seat1 304, seat2 126. Preflop they both checked. Flop they both checked. Turn they both checked. So they are passive. Could be they have weak hands or are slow playing strong. Could be they have a set of 7s (they would have raised earlier). But they may be slow playing a set.

          "reasoning_content": "We have AK hearts? Actually Th Ah (Ten hearts Ace hearts). So Ace Ten offsuit? Actually both hearts: Ten hearts and Ace hearts: A\u2665 T\u2665, suited Ace Ten (ATs). Good hand, strong. Position CO (cutoff). Preflop: seat2 posted small blind 1, seat3 posted big blind 2, seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 4. So raise from 2BB to 4 (2x BB). We have 179 chips stack.\n\nWe need to decide: call 4 (total pot after call would be 4+4+1+2? Actually pot currently 7 chips includes blinds 1+2+? plus raise 4? Let's compute: before action: SB 1, BB 2, then seat4 raise to 4 (meaning total bet 4). So pot = 1+2+4 =7 (as given). To call we need to put 4 total (so add 2 more? Actually we haven't posted any chips yet; to call we must put 4 chips, matching raise. So call cost = 4. Minimum raise to 6 (meaning raise total to 6). So raise amount would be 6 total (i.e., add 2 more than call). So we can raise to 6, or more.\n\nGiven hand ATs, position CO, raise is strong. Opponent MiniMax-M2's tendencies: from recall: they have raised preflop 4 in hand 6 and 11 (two raises). In hand 6 they raised 4 (same amount) and later bet big on flop/turn. So they are capable of raising with some strength, perhaps a wide range? Hand 14 they called preflop 2 (so they called a raise? Actually hand 14 they called 2? That suggests they called a raise of 2? Not sure. But overall they sometimes raise, sometimes fold.\n\nGiven we have a premium hand, we could 3-bet. Stack is deep (89.5 BB). Raising to 6 is minimal; we could raise larger to isolate and build pot. Considering tournament stage? Not given. But we have decent stack.\n\nWhat about other players behind us? No one else yet (we are CO, then button? Actually seat5 is us, seat6 maybe? Not listed. So after us, seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is next (UTG?), but they are in early position? Actually seat1 is after seat5? Table seats: 1,2,3,4,5. So after seat5, seat1 is next (the dealer maybe?). So we act before seat1, seat2, seat3, seat4 already acted. So only seat1 left to act after us. So we could raise to isolate MiniMax-M2 or we could just call and let others act.\n\nGiven ATs is a strong hand but not top of range for 3-bet vs unknown raise. However in tournament, you may want to 3-bet for value and to build pot. Opponent's raise size is small (2BB). So 3-betting to 6 is 3x raise (or 3x BB). Could also raise to like 12-15 to apply pressure. But we must consider stack depth and possible re-raise. MiniMax-M2 may 4-bet all-in? Unlikely with 89 BB.\n\nI think best is to raise to 6 (minimum) to take initiative and thin the field, and if seat1 calls we have a multi-way pot but still okay. Could also raise to 12 to isolate. Considering our hand is suited Ace Ten, we like to see flop. But also we could just call and see flop cheap. However raising gives us chance to win bigger pot and also maybe steal blinds later. I think raise.\n\nThus action: raise to 6. Reasoning: strong hand, position, opponent's raise small, want to build pot, isolate.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Then Seat4 re-raised to 8 (so a 4-bet to 8). So now we face a 4-bet to 8, we have already put 6 in, need to call 2 more to match 8. Minimum raise to 10 (so raise to 10 total). Our stack 173, we can call.\n\nWe need decide: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand AA is premium. Facing 4-bet from MiniMax-M2. Likely they have strong range. Could be AA, KK, maybe QQ, AK. We have AA, so we are ahead of most. Should we just call (flat) or 4-bet raise? The raise to 10 would be a 5-bet (but min raise is 10 total). So raise to 10 is just 2 more chips beyond call (i.e., 4 more total). That's minimal raise. Could also go all-in but not needed.\n\nGiven stack depth 86.5 BB, tournament stage unknown but early. We want to get value. The opponent 4-bet size is small (8). Raising to 10 would be a tiny raise, might be seen as a \"donk\" but could extract more. But we could also just call and see flop, but AA is strong.\n\nWe need consider that we are out of position (still BB vs UTG? Actually seat4 is maybe MP? But we are BB, after flop we will be out of position vs them). So we may want to build pot.\n\nGiven they 4-bet small, could be a bluff or a light 4-bet. Raising to 10 (i.e., 5-bet) is small; perhaps better to call and then see flop. But we have AA, we could also re-raise to maybe 12-14 to get more value. However min raise is 10, but we can raise higher? The legal actions: raise (no limit specified). Minimum raise to: 10. So we can raise to any amount >=10 up to our stack. So we could raise to, say, 30 to extract value. But we must consider opponent's likely range; they may have strong hands, but still we can get value.\n\nGiven tournament, we have a deep stack, we can raise to maybe 30-40 to protect against draws.\n\nBut also we risk them folding better hands? Actually they are already 4-bet, likely strong, they may call a reasonable raise.\n\nI think best is to raise to around 30 (i.e., 5-bet) to get value and protect.\n\nCheck legal: we can raise to any amount up to stack.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand: Th Ah (Ace Ten hearts). Board: 7h Qs 3c. We are BB with 149 chips. Pot 104 before flop? Actually after preflop action, pot now 104? The flop bet is 35 from MiniMax-M2 (Seat4). So we face 35 bet, pot currently 104 (including bet? Actually pot before bet was 104, then seat4 bets 35 making pot 139? But amount to call is 35, and we need to decide.\n\nOur hand: top pair? We have Ace high, not paired yet. Board: Q, 7, 3. No flush draw (we have hearts: Th, Ah, board has 7h, so we have a nut flush draw? Actually we have two hearts, board has one heart. So we have a flush draw: we have Ah and Th, board 7h. That's three hearts, need two more hearts for flush. So we have a nut flush draw (Ace high). Also we have overcards (A, T) to board. Potential straight draws? Not really.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 35 into pot 104. That's about 1/3 pot. Could be continuation bet. We have decent draw and overcards. Should we call? Pot odds: need 35 to win pot ~ (104+35*2?) Actually after call, pot will be 104 + 35 (bet) + 35 (call) = 174. So we need to invest 35 to win 174, odds = 35/174 = 20.1% needed. Our equity: With Ace Ten hearts vs unknown hand. Let's estimate: We have about 12 outs? Flush outs: need two more hearts: there are 13 hearts total, we have Ah, Th, board 7h, so remaining hearts = 10. Actually we have two hearts in hand, one on board, so 10 hearts left. Also straight draws? Not many. Overcards may pair. So approx 10 outs. 10 outs gives ~ 20% chance on turn (if one card left) and ~ 35% by river. Since two cards to come, equity maybe around 30%? So calling is profitable.\n\nAlso we have deep stack 149, can raise? Minimum raise to 70, raise would be 70 total, meaning raise additional 35. Might be good to raise as semi-bluff to put pressure. But we have only 35 to call; raising to 70 would be 35 more. Could we raise? Yes legal. Should we raise? Opponent might fold weaker hands, but also we could get called and we have equity.\n\nGiven we are out of position (BB vs opponent in seat4, who is likely in early position? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, preflop they raised, we 3-bet, they 4-bet? Wait preflop: seat4 raise 4, seat5 raise 6 (our 3-bet), seat1 call 6, seat4 raise 8 (4-bet to 8?), seat5 raise 30 (5-bet), seat4 call 22. So they called our 5-bet. So they are likely a strong hand preflop. They have likely a premium hand like AK, AQ, JJ, TT, maybe pocket pairs. Board Qs 7h 3c, they have Qx maybe. So they could have Qx, which is top pair. Our hand is Ace high, but we have nut flush draw and overcards. So a raise might be okay to protect against them calling with Qx.\n\nGiven they are likely strong, raising may fold out some weaker Q hands? Actually they already have Q? Might call. Raising might be too aggressive? But we have strong draw, can raise to 70 to make them pay more.\n\nConsider stack sizes: they have 111 chips (from table). So they have about 111. If we raise to 70, they would need to call 35 more (since they already bet 35). They could call 35 to see turn, leaving them with 76 chips left. They might fold if they think we have strong. Might be good.\n\nGiven pot odds and equity, a call is safe. Raising could be okay but risk they fold and we lose value? But we already have equity to call.\n\nThus I will call.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Actually we have a pair of Aces, also we have a straight draw? Board: 7h Qs 3c Jd. Our hand: Th Ah. We have A T, making a pair of Aces, plus we have a gutshot? The board: 7, Q, 3, J. Adding our T gives we have a straight draw: 7-8-9-10-J? Actually we have 7, J, Q, we have T, we need 9 to complete straight 7-8-9-10-J? Wait need sequence: 7-8-9-10-J? That's 7,8,9,10,J. We have J on board, T in hand, need 9 and 8? Not correct. Let's examine: Straight possibilities with T: T-J-Q-K-A is a straight if we have K and A. We have A, board has Q,J, need K. So we have a gutshot for A-K-Q-J-10? Actually we have A and T, board Q,J. Need K to make Broadway? The straight would be T-J-Q-K-A; we have T and A, board has J, Q, need K. That's one card, not a gutshot, it's an open-ended? Actually we need K, only one rank. That's a gutshot? The missing card is K. So we have a \"inside\" straight draw needing exactly K. So probability about 4 outs (maybe 3 if K of same suit as something? No flush possibilities). Also we have a pair of Aces, which is top pair (since board has no Ace). Opponent seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) checked. Let's recall preflop: seat 4 raised to 4, we raised to 6, seat1 called 6, seat4 re-raised to 8, we reraise to 30, seat4 called 22. So preflop action: we 3-bet to 30, they called. So they likely have a strong hand. Flop: board 7h Qs 3c Jd. Seat4 bet 35, we called 35. So they bet on flop. That indicates they have something like a pair, maybe a straight draw, maybe a set, maybe a two pair, etc. Our hand AA is strong but not top? Actually they could have QJ, QJ, or maybe a set of 7s or 3s. But board: 7h Qs 3c Jd. They bet 35 into pot 139? Actually pot before flop? Preflop pot: contributions: seat4 4, seat5 6, seat1 6, seat4 8 (re-raise), seat5 30, seat4 call 22. Let's compute: seat4 initial raise 4, seat5 raise to 6 (call? Actually seat5 raise 6). seat1 call 6. Then seat4 re-raise to 8 (meaning raise to 8? Actually they raise to 8, we raise to 30, seat1 folds, seat4 calls 22). So total preflop: seat4 put 8+22=30? Actually seat4 initially 4, then 8, then call 22 => total 34? Let's not compute exactly. Anyway flop pot 139, they bet 35, we called. So now pot after flop call: 139+35+35 = 209. Turn is now.

We have J on board, T in hand, need 9 and 8? Not correct. Let's examine: Straight possibilities with T: T-J-Q-K-A is a straight if we have K and A. We have A, board has Q,J, need K. So we have a gutshot for A-K-Q-J-10? Actually we have A and T, board Q,J. Need K to make Broadway? The straight would be T-J-Q-K-A; we have T and A, board has J, Q, need K. That's one card, not a gutshot, it's an open-ended? Actually we need K, only one rank. That's a gutshot? The missing card is K. So we have a \"inside\" straight draw needing exactly K. So probability about 4 outs (maybe 3 if K of same suit as something? No flush possibilities). Also we have a pair of Aces, which is top pair (since board has no Ace). Opponent seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) checked. Let's recall preflop: seat 4 raised to 4, we raised to 6, seat1 called 6, seat4 re-raised to 8, we reraise to 30, seat4 called 22. So preflop action: we 3-bet to 30, they called. So they likely have a strong hand. Flop: board 7h Qs 3c Jd. Seat4 bet 35, we called 35. So they bet on flop. That indicates they have something like a pair, maybe a straight draw, maybe a set, maybe a two pair, etc. Our hand AA is strong but not top? Actually they could have QJ, QJ, or maybe a set of 7s or 3s. But board: 7h Qs 3c Jd. They bet 35 into pot 139? Actually pot before flop? Preflop pot: contributions: seat4 4, seat5 6, seat1 6, seat4 8 (re-raise), seat5 30, seat4 call 22. Let's compute: seat4 initial raise 4, seat5 raise to 6 (call? Actually seat5 raise 6). seat1 call 6. Then seat4 re-raise to 8 (meaning raise to 8? Actually they raise to 8, we raise to 30, seat1 folds, seat4 calls 22). So total preflop: seat4 put 8+22=30? Actually seat4 initially 4, then 8, then call 22 => total 34? Let's not compute exactly. Anyway flop pot 139, they bet 35, we called. So now pot after flop call: 139+35+35 = 209. Turn is now.

Actually seat5 raised to 30, seat4 call 22 to match? Wait seat5 raise to 30, meaning total bet 30? Preflop pot: small blind 1 from seat2, big blind 2 from seat3.

Not yet, they have 41 chips left after posting 2? Actually seat4 had 41 chips total; they posted 2 as big blind? Wait seat4 is CO? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, position? Not given but seat4 is maybe CO or something. They raised to 4 (so they posted 2 as blind? Actually blinds are seat2 SB, seat3 BB. So seat4 is not blind; they raised to 4 (cost 4). seat5 (us) raise to 6 (cost 6). seat1 call 6. seat4 raise to 8 (cost 8). seat5 raise to 30 (cost 30). seat4 call 22 (cost 22). So seat4's total contribution: 4 + 8 + 22 = 34? Actually they initially put 4, then 8 (additional 4?), then call 22 (additional 22?). Not sure. But they have 41 chips, after putting 34 they'd have 7 left? Actually they may be all-in soon. After preflop, pot size: small blind 1, big blind 2, seat4 4, seat5 6, seat1 6, seat4 additional 8, seat5 raise to 30, seat4 call 22 => seat5 contributed 30, seat4 contributed 22, seat1 folded. So seat4 total contributions: 4+8+22=34. seat5 total: 6+30=36? plus blind? seat5 is BB? Actually seat5 is BB, posted 2. So seat5's total: 2 (big blind) + 4 (raise to 6?) Wait they raised to 6 after seat4 raise to 4, so they put 4 more? Actually they already posted 2 as BB, then raise to 6 means they add 4. Then later raise to 30 (additional 24). So total: 2+4+24=30. But the raise to 30 is total bet of 30, not additional. So they put 30 total preflop, which includes the 2 BB. So contributions: seat5 30, seat4 34? So seat4 may be short stack, but they still have chips left after call? They had 41, contributed 34, left 7. So after flop, seat4 bets 35, seat5 calls 35. That likely puts seat4 all-in (since they only have 7 left, they cannot bet 35). Wait seat4 bet 35, but they only have 7 left, so they'd be all-in for 7? Something off. Maybe stack numbers are after posting blinds? Let's not overthink. At river, seat4 checks, we have option to check or bet? Legal actions: fold, check (no raise). So we cannot raise because min raise is 70 but not allowed? Actually legal actions: fold, check. So we cannot raise; maybe because seat4 is all-in? Actually seat4 may"

Actually actions: preflop: seat4 raise 4 (open). seat5 raise 6 (3-bet). seat1 call 6. seat2 fold, seat3 fold. seat4 raise 8 (4-bet). seat5 raise 30 (5-bet). seat1 fold. seat4 call 22 (call 30? Actually seat5 raised to 30, seat4 call 22 to match? Wait seat5 raise to 30, meaning total bet 30? Preflop pot: small blind 1 from seat2, big blind 2 from seat3. Then seat4 raise to 4 (so 2 more). seat5 raise to 6 (so 2 more). seat1 call 6. seat4 raise to 8 (so 2 more). seat5 raise to 30 (so 22 more). seat4 call 22 (so matches 30). So preflop they are all-in? Not yet, they have 41 chips left after posting 2? Actually seat4 had 41 chips total; they posted 2 as big blind? Wait seat4 is CO? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, position? Not given but seat4 is maybe CO or something. They raised to 4 (so they posted 2 as blind? Actually blinds are seat2 SB, seat3 BB. So seat4 is not blind; they raised to 4 (cost 4). seat5 (us) raise to 6 (cost 6). seat1 call 6. seat4 raise to 8 (cost 8). seat5 raise to 30 (cost 30). seat4 call 22 (cost 22). So seat4's total contribution: 4 + 8 + 22 = 34? Actually they initially put 4, then 8 (additional 4?), then call 22 (additional 22?). Not sure. But they have 41 chips, after putting 34 they'd have 7 left? Actually they may be all-in soon. After preflop, pot size: small blind 1, big blind 2, seat4 4, seat5 6, seat1 6, seat4 additional 8, seat5 raise to 30, seat4 call 22 => seat5 contributed 30, seat4 contributed 22, seat1 folded. So seat4 total contributions: 4+8+22=34. seat5 total: 6+30=36? plus blind? seat5 is BB? Actually seat5 is BB, posted 2. So seat5's total: 2 (big blind) + 4 (raise to 6?) Wait they raised to 6 after seat4 raise to 4, so they put 4 more? Actually they already posted 2 as BB, then raise to 6 means they add 4. Then later raise to 30 (additional 24). So total: 2+4+24=30. But the raise to 30 is total bet of 30, not additional. So they put 30 total preflop, which includes the 2 BB. So contributions: seat5 30, seat4 34? So seat4 may be short stack, but they still have chips left after call? They had 41, contributed 34, left 7. So after flop, seat4 bets 35, seat5 calls 35. That likely puts seat4 all-in (since they only have 7 left, they cannot bet 35). Wait seat4 bet 35, but they only have 7 left, so they'd be all-in for 7? Something off. Maybe stack numbers are after posting blinds? Let's not overthink. At river, seat4 checks, we have option to check or bet? Legal actions: fold, check (no raise). So we cannot raise because min raise is 70 but not allowed? Actually legal actions: fold, check. So we cannot raise; maybe because seat4 is all-in? Actually seat4 may",

Our hand: 9s 3h, so we have no pair, just 9-high. The board is paired Kings, so there is a full house possible for opponents if they have a King or a Jack. Also there is a possible straight draw? Board: K J K 2, no. So we have a very weak hand.\n\nWe are in BB, stack 42 chips, pot 5 chips. It's turn. No bet yet on turn (since actions show amount to call 0). So we can check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. There's no bet to call. So we could check. Raising would be a bluff. But given we have 9-3, very weak. Opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) called preflop, then checked flop. Likely they have something like a King, maybe a Jack, maybe a draw. On turn, board shows two Kings, making a full house possible if they have a King or a Jack. They might have a hand like Kx, Jx, maybe a set? Actually set of Kings not possible because only two Kings on board. If they have a King, they'd have trips (three Kings) and board also has a King pair, making full house? Wait board has two Kings, they have one King, that makes three Kings. The board also has a Jack, so they have three Kings and a Jack on board: that's a full house Kings over Jacks? Actually full house is three of a kind plus a pair. They have three Kings (two on board + one in hand) and the board also has a pair of Kings? Wait board has two Kings, not a pair of Jacks. The board is Kd Jc Kh 2d. That's two Kings, one Jack, one 2. If they hold a King, they'd have three Kings, plus the board's Jack is a singleton, and the 2 is a singleton. So they'd have three Kings, not a full house yet. They need a pair on board to make a full house: they have three Kings, board has a pair of Kings? Actually board has two Kings, that's a pair. So they'd have a full house: Kings full of Jacks? Let's think: hand: K?; board: K K J 2. They have K (one). So total Kings: three (two board + one hand). For a full house you need three of a kind plus a pair. The pair could be the two Kings on board, but those are already used in the three-of-a-kind? In Texas Hold'em, you choose any five cards from the seven. So they could choose three Kings (two board + one hand) and the pair of Jacks? But only one Jack on board. They need a pair of something else, maybe the 2? There's only one 2. So they cannot make a full house with just one King. Actually full house requires a pair of some rank. They have three Kings, need a pair of another rank. The board has a Jack and a 2, each singletons. So they don't have a pair. So they have just three of a kind (trip Kings). That's a strong hand but not full house. If they have a Jack, they'd have two Jacks (one board, one hand) plus pair of Kings on board, making full house Jacks full of Kings? Actually they'd have two Jacks (one board, one hand) and two Kings on board => that's two pair, not full house. Need three of a kind of one rank. So if they have a Jack, they'd have pair of Jacks plus pair of Kings (two pair). So best possible is trips Kings if they have a King, or two pair if they have a Jack, or maybe a straight draw? No.\n\nThus our hand is very weak. Likely we should check and hope opponent checks back, then we might fold later. Since we have no chance, we should check. There's no bet to call. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions include raise, but raising is a bluff, but we have short stack 42 chips, still enough. But raising may get us all-in if opponent folds? Opponent might call with any decent hand. Bluff may be okay but risk losing chips. Considering tournament, we have 21 BB, not huge but not short. We can preserve chips.\n\nThus we choose check.\n\nReturn JSON."

For a full house you need three of a kind plus a pair. The pair could be the two Kings on board, but those are already used in the three-of-a-kind? In Texas Hold'em, you choose any five cards from the seven. So they could choose three Kings (two board + one hand) and the pair of Jacks? But only one Jack on board. They need a pair of something else, maybe the 2? There's only one 2. So they cannot make a full house with just one King. Actually full house requires a pair of some rank. They have three Kings, need a pair of another rank. The board has a Jack and a 2, each singletons. So they don't have a pair. So they have just three of a kind (trip Kings). That's a strong hand but not full house. If they have a Jack, they'd have two Jacks (one board, one hand) plus pair of Kings on board, making full house Jacks full of Kings? Actually they'd have two Jacks (one board, one hand) and two Kings on board => that's two pair, not full house. Need three of a kind of one rank. So if they have a Jack, they'd have pair of Jacks plus pair of Kings (two pair). So best possible is trips Kings if they have a King, or two pair if they have a Jack, or maybe a straight draw? No.\n\nThus our hand is very weak. Likely we should check and hope opponent checks back, then we might fold later. Since we have no chance, we should check. There's no bet to call. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions include raise, but raising is a bluff, but we have short stack 42 chips, still enough. But raising may get us all-in if opponent folds? Opponent might call with any decent hand. Bluff may be okay but risk losing chips. Considering tournament, we have 21 BB, not huge but not short. We can preserve chips.\n\nThus we choose check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K? No Q missing. 8-9-10-J-Q? Q missing. So no straight. There's a pair of Kings. So board is pair of Kings. Our hand 9s 3h gives us just high card 9. Not a pair.

Opponent may have missed the board and we could try steal. But we have no information about opponent tendencies. Let's recall opponent's actions earlier in hand: They called preflop 2, then checked flop and turn. So they are passive. Could be they have a weak hand like a missed draw. River: board shows K K J T 2. Opponent may have a King (makes trips) or a Jack, Ten (makes two pair), or a 2 (makes full house? Actually 2 with board gives two pair 2s and Ks? Actually board has 2 only one, so 2 + pair of Kings = two pair K's and 2's). Could have a straight draw? Not possible. Could have a flush? No two clubs: Jc, maybe other clubs? Not enough. So opponent's range likely includes Kx (makes trips), Jx (makes two pair), Tx (makes two pair), 2x (makes two pair), maybe a 9? 9 with board gives 9 high, not good. So they likely have a decent hand.

He posted BB 4, we are SB? Actually we are BB seat5, posted BB 4. Seat2 posted SB 2 then folded. So we are in BB, facing a raise? No one raised; only blinds posted. So amount to call is 2 (the SB). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total). So we can call 2 to see flop, raise to 8, or fold (unlikely). Hand KJ offsuit (Jc Kd) is decent but not premium. In BB with short stack 35 chips (8.8 BB). Need to consider tournament stage; short stack, need to accumulate chips. 8 BB is moderate; we could consider a steal raise? But we are BB, the SB already posted 2. The SB is a short stack? Seat2 folded. So only opponent left is the big stack (Seat1) who is in BB? Wait seat1 is BB? Actually seat1 posted BB 4; seat5 is our seat, we are BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". But seat1 posted BB 4, seat5 posted SB 2? Actually actions: \"preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 2\" then \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 4\". So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But the problem says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". That's contradictory. Probably they consider seat5 as BB because they are in the big blind seat (maybe they reversed). But actions show seat5 posted SB. Might be a mistake. However, amount to call is 2 (SB). So we are in BB and need to call 2 to match SB? Actually in BB you would call the SB's raise? Wait scenario: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, then action goes to player left of BB (UTG) but all folded. So after blinds, action is on the player after BB (i.e., UTG) but all folded, so next is SB? Actually in heads-up, SB acts first preflop, then BB. But here many folded, so after SB, next is BB (us). Since SB posted 2, we have already posted BB 4, but we can either check (i.e., just continue) or raise. The amount to call is 2 (the SB). Since we already have 4 in pot, we need to call 2 to match SB's bet? Actually SB's bet is 2, BB posted 4, but that is a blind, not a bet. The effective bet is 2 from SB; BB can either check (i.e., not raise) or raise. To check, we need to put in 0 additional chips, but the amount to call is 2? Wait typical rules: After blinds, the action is on the player left of BB. If all others fold, the SB acts first; they can either check (i.e., just call the BB) or raise. But SB already posted 2, BB posted 4, so SB is effectively 2 under BB. So SB can check (i.e., just call the BB) meaning they add 2 to match BB? Actually in heads-up, the SB is the small blind and acts first; they have the option to raise or check (i.e., just call the big blind). If they check, they need to put in 2 more to match the BB's 4, making the total 4 each. So the amount to call for BB is 2 (the additional amount needed to match the SB's check). So BB can either check (i.e., call 0) or raise. In many implementations, BB can check (i.e., just continue) and no further chips are required. The amount to call being 2 suggests that the SB has checked, adding 2 to bring to 4, and BB now needs to call 2 to match? Actually the BB already has 4 in, SB had 2, but to check they must add 2 to make 4, but the system says amount to call is 2, meaning BB must put 2 more to call SB's check? That seems odd. However typical scenario: If SB checks, they add 2, making pot 6 (2+4). Then action is on BB, who can check (i.e., do nothing) because they already have 4, which matches SB's 4. So amount to call is 0. But the system says amount to call 2. So perhaps the SB raised to 2 (i.e.,"

          "reasoning_content": "We need decide action preflop BB with Jc Kd, stack 35 chips, 8.8 BB, blinds 2/4, pot 6. Opponents: Seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 252 chips (big stack). He posted BB 4, we are SB? Actually we are BB seat5, posted BB 4. Seat2 posted SB 2 then folded. So we are in BB, facing a raise? No one raised; only blinds posted. So amount to call is 2 (the SB). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total). So we can call 2 to see flop, raise to 8, or fold (unlikely). Hand KJ offsuit (Jc Kd) is decent but not premium. In BB with short stack 35 chips (8.8 BB). Need to consider tournament stage; short stack, need to accumulate chips. 8 BB is moderate; we could consider a steal raise? But we are BB, the SB already posted 2. The SB is a short stack? Seat2 folded. So only opponent left is the big stack (Seat1) who is in BB? Wait seat1 is BB? Actually seat1 posted BB 4; seat5 is our seat, we are BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". But seat1 posted BB 4, seat5 posted SB 2? Actually actions: \"preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 2\" then \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 4\". So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But the problem says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". That's contradictory. Probably they consider seat5 as BB because they are in the big blind seat (maybe they reversed). But actions show seat5 posted SB. Might be a mistake. However, amount to call is 2 (SB). So we are in BB and need to call 2 to match SB? Actually in BB you would call the SB's raise? Wait scenario: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, then action goes to player left of BB (UTG) but all folded. So after blinds, action is on the player after BB (i.e., UTG) but all folded, so next is SB? Actually in heads-up, SB acts first preflop, then BB. But here many folded, so after SB, next is BB (us). Since SB posted 2, we have already posted BB 4, but we can either check (i.e., just continue) or raise. The amount to call is 2 (the SB). Since we already have 4 in pot, we need to call 2 to match SB's bet? Actually SB's bet is 2, BB posted 4, but that is a blind, not a bet. The effective bet is 2 from SB; BB can either check (i.e., not raise) or raise. To check, we need to put in 0 additional chips, but the amount to call is 2? Wait typical rules: After blinds, the action is on the player left of BB. If all others fold, the SB acts first; they can either check (i.e., just call the BB) or raise. But SB already posted 2, BB posted 4, so SB is effectively 2 under BB. So SB can check (i.e., just call the BB) meaning they add 2 to match BB? Actually in heads-up, the SB is the small blind and acts first; they have the option to raise or check (i.e., just call the big blind). If they check, they need to put in 2 more to match the BB's 4, making the total 4 each. So the amount to call for BB is 2 (the additional amount needed to match the SB's check). So BB can either check (i.e., call 0) or raise. In many implementations, BB can check (i.e., just continue) and no further chips are required. The amount to call being 2 suggests that the SB has checked, adding 2 to bring to 4, and BB now needs to call 2 to match? Actually the BB already has 4 in, SB had 2, but to check they must add 2 to make 4, but the system says amount to call is 2, meaning BB must put 2 more to call SB's check? That seems odd. However typical scenario: If SB checks, they add 2, making pot 6 (2+4). Then action is on BB, who can check (i.e., do nothing) because they already have 4, which matches SB's 4. So amount to call is 0. But the system says amount to call 2. So perhaps the SB raised to 2 (i.e.,",

In BB, can either call 2 (i.e., just match SB) or raise to 8 min. Considering stack size, raising could be good to steal blinds, but opponent (Seat1) is big stack, could call. KJ is decent, but against a big stack, maybe we can raise to apply pressure. Since we are short, we might want to be aggressive. Minimum raise to 8 total (i.e., add 4 more chips beyond our 4?). Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Our current blind is 4, so raise_to 8 means we add 4 more. That would be a raise of 4 (to 8 total). That is a small raise, but could be a steal. Might be okay.\n\nAlternatively, we could just call and see flop, but KJ off-suit is vulnerable. With 8 BB, we want to avoid being stuck. I'd lean to raise to 8 to try to win blinds, especially since SB is out (folded) and only opponent is big stack in BB? Wait we are BB, the only other active player is seat1 (the big blind) who already posted 4 and is also our opponent? Actually seat1 is the big blind (BB). So we are SB? This is confusing. Let's assume we are BB, SB folded, so only we and seat1 (big blind) remain? But seat1 is BB, we are BB? Something off. Possibly we are SB and seat1 is BB. In that case, we are SB with KJ, SB posted 2, BB posted 4, we act first preflop. Amount to call is 2 (i.e., we need to call 2 more to match BB). So we can call 2 (making total 4 each) or raise to 8 total (i.e., raise by 4). That seems plausible. So we are SB, acting first. In that case, raising is standard to steal BB. With KJ off-suit, raise is okay. So raise to 8.\n\nThus JSON: action \"raise\", raise_to 8, reasoning.",

So amount to call is 8, min raise to 12. So we need to decide fold/call/raise.\n\nOur hand: 6s Td (6 of spades, Ten of diamonds). Not a premium hand. In cutoff, with short stack (11.8 BB). Options: call 8 (which is 2 BB) to see flop, but stack is 47, after call we have 39 left. That's okay. However 6T is a marginal hand, not suited, not connected. Could be a steal attempt? But we are not the initial raiser; seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8. That is a small raise, about 2 BB. Might be a wide open raise from cutoff (since seat4 is button? Actually seat4 is position after us? Wait seats: seat1, seat2, seat3, seat4, seat5 (us). So seat4 is the player to our left? Actually positions: seat5 is CO, seat6 would be BTN (but only 5 seats?), maybe 5 players? Actually we have seats 1-5, so seat5 is CO, seat1 is UTG? Not sure. But seat4 is presumably the button (since seat5 is CO, seat4 is BTN). So button raised to 8. That is a standard open raise of 2 BB. So we face a raise from button. Our hand 6T is not a good call. With short stack we could consider going all-in (47) as a shove? That's too much compared to raise size. But we could also raise (shove) as a 3-bet all-in to steal blinds? However 6T is not a strong hand to 3-bet. But we have short stack; could be considered a push/fold strategy. At 12 BB effective stack, the push/fold chart suggests with 6T we might push from CO? Typically with 11.8 BB, push/fold ranges are fairly wide, but 6T off-suit is maybe marginal. Usually you push with any Ace, any pair, broadway combos, suited connectors, and maybe some suited one-gappers. Off-suit Ten-Six is usually not a push. So likely fold.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 raises small (4 BB) sometimes, but we have data: they raised 4 in previous hands (small). Could be a wide range. But still 6T off-suit is weak.\n\nThus best action: fold.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. So we choose fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

With only 10.8 BB we want to build a pot when ahead and avoid playing out of position with a marginal call. Raising to the minimum (12 total) isolates the SB, puts pressure on their range, and leaves us enough chips to continue if we get called.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have As Js (Ace high, suited). In BB with 10.8 BB stack (43 chips). SB posted 2, BB 4. Player in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8 (i.e., 8 total? Actually raise to 8 means they put 8 total, which is 4 over BB? Wait: preflop: Seat 4 post_sb 2 (they are SB). Seat 5 post_bb 4 (us). Then seat 4 raise 8. So they raised to 8 total, meaning they added 6 more (since they already had 2). So amount to call is 4 (difference between 8 and 4). Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise to 12 total). So we can call 4 to see flop, or raise to at least 12.\n\nOur hand AsJs is strong suited ace, good for 3-bet. Stack is shortish 10.8 BB, but still enough to 3-bet. Consider opponent: MiniMax-M2's preflop raise pattern: from recall, they have raised 8 (hand #26) and 12 (hand #27). Not many data, but they might be raising wide? Also they called 10 in hand 23 (maybe they called a raise). No fold data? They folded some times. We need to decide.\n\nIn early tournament, 10.8 BB is low stack; we might want to preserve chips but also try to double up. AsJs is a good hand for 3-bet, especially against a raise from SB (they are in position, but we are out of position in BB). However 3-bet size: Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise to 12 total). That would be 8 more chips (since we already have 4 in pot). That would be 12 total put in, meaning we add 8 more (so our total contribution becomes 12). That would be a 3-bet of 8 extra (so raise amount = 8). That's small relative to stack but typical for short stack? With 43 chips, a raise to 12 leaves us 31 chips left (approx 7.75 BB). If we get called, pot will be 12 (original) + 8 (our raise) + 4 (call) = 24? Wait compute: Initially pot 12 (SB 2 + BB 4). SB raises to 8 (adds 6). So pot now 12 (2+4+6). To call we need 4 more. If we raise to 12, we add 8 (12-4). Then pot becomes 12 + 8 (our raise) = 20, plus SB's call 4 later maybe. Actually if they call, they add 4, making pot 24.\n\nIs 3-bet advisable? AsJs vs SB's raise. Could also consider folding? Not good. Call? With 10.8 BB, calling 4 gives us 8 effective stack after flop? Actually we would have 39 chips left (43-4). In pot 12+4=16. So pot odds: 4 to call for 16 pot, 25% chance needed. AsJs is decent but not premium; but we have position? No, we are out of position (BB vs SB). After flop we will be first to act. Might be okay.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we want to be aggressive. 3-bet could isolate and get heads-up with good hand. AsJs is good for 3-bet. So raise to 12 seems good.\n\nConsider opponent's tendencies: They have raised to 12 before, maybe they are capable of 3-betting themselves? Not known. But we have Ace high, could dominate many hands.\n\nThus decision: raise to 12.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Seat4 raise 8 (so from 2 to 8? Actually raise to 8 total). Then seat5 (us) raise to 12 (so we re-raised to 12). Then seat4 raise to 16 (so they 3-bet to 16). Now amount to call is 4 (they raised from 12 to 16, so we need to call 4 more). Minimum raise to 20 (so we could raise to at least 20 total). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have A\u2660 J\u2660. Position: BB, short stack 35, effective stacks: opponent seat4 likely has larger stack 296 chips. We are deepish? 35 chips is 8.8 BB, short stack. The opponent 3-bet to 16 (4x SB). Our stack after posting 4 is 35; after our 12 raise we have 35-12 = 23 left? Wait we posted 4 initially, then raised to 12 total (i.e., added 8 more). So we have 35-12 = 23 chips left. Opponent raised to 16 total, we need call 4 more, leaving us 19 chips after call. Minimum raise to 20 would be total bet of 20, meaning we would need to add 8 more (since already at 12). That would be a 4-bet to 20 total, leaving us 15 chips left (since 35-20 = 15). That's a big commitment: 20 chips is >50% of stack.\n\nHand AsJs is strong but not premium for short stack vs 3-bet. Against a 3-bet from unknown opponent (MiniMax-M2) we need to consider their range: could be strong (AA, KK, QQ, AK) or also suited connectors, etc. With 8.8 BB, we might consider either calling and seeing flop (if implied odds) or shoving all-in. The raise to 20 is not all-in; all-in would be 35 (or 31 after call?). Actually all-in would be 35 total, but we can't raise to 35 because min raise is 20; we could raise to 35 (all-in) as a raise. So we could go all-in.\n\nGiven stack short, typical tournament strategy: either fold or go all-in (or maybe call). With AJs, calling 4 more (to 16) leaves us 19 chips left, still short. After call, we will be out of position preflop (we're in BB). Postflop we have 19 chips left; effective stack 19 vs opponent's 280+? Actually opponent's stack after raising 16, they have 296-16 = 280 left. So we are extremely short; we will be forced to go all-in on any flop bet. So calling is effectively a flop all-in scenario. That is okay if AJs has decent equity vs opponent's 3-bet range. But with such a short stack, we should consider shoving all-in now to maximize fold equity? But we are already short; raising to 20 is only 5 more chips, not much. All-in would be 35 total, which is 15 more chips than calling. Might be too much; but if we think opponent can fold to a 4-bet, we could steal. However with AJs, against a 3-bet we may be ahead of some but behind AA, KK, QQ, AK. 3-bet from SB could be wide, but they are likely strong. The pot currently: after their 16 raise, pot is 28 (initial) + 8 (their raise?) Let's compute: initial pot 28 includes blinds? Actually pot 28 chips after posting blinds? Not sure. Anyway.\n\nGiven we are short and have decent hand, calling seems reasonable to see flop. But we need to consider tournament stage: stack 35 chips, blinds 2/4, we have about 9 BB, not in danger of blind steal. Might want to preserve chips. If we call and lose, we go down to 19 chips (~4.75 BB). That's still playable. If we fold, we lose 12 chips (our raise) and are left with 23 chips (5.75 BB). Actually we already raised to 12, but if we fold now we lose 12 chips? Wait we have already put 12 into pot; folding now means we lose that 12, leaving 23 chips. That's okay.

Amount to call 16, min raise 32, legal actions fold, call. So cannot raise (maybe because min raise exceeds stack? Actually min raise to 32 would be total 32, which is less than our stack 31? Wait stack 31, cannot raise to 32, so raise not legal; only fold or call). So decision: call or fold.\n\nWe need to consider hand strength: As Js gives us Ace high, gutshot? Actually board Qc 6d 8c, we have open-ended straight draw? Let's see: we have A and J. Straight possibilities: 9-10? With J, we need 10 and 9 for straight? Actually board: Q,6,8. We have J, A. Straight draws: we have J, need 10 and 9 to make straight (J-10-9-8-7? Not). Actually we have J, board 8,6, Q. No straight draw. Flush? Board has clubs: Qc, 8c. We have As (spade) and Js (spade). No clubs. So only Ace high, maybe pair of J? No J on board. So we have Ace high, maybe top pair? No. So we are likely behind. Opponent's bet 16 into 48 pot (33% pot). Could be a continuation bet with many hands, including Qx, 8x, 6x, draws, etc. Our stack is short (31). We are short-stacked (7.8 BB). Pot odds: need to call 16 to win 48+16=64? Actually pot is 48 before bet, opponent bet 16, so total pot after call = 48+16+16 = 80? Wait typical: pot 48, opponent bets 16, we call 16, pot becomes 48+16+16 = 80. So we need to call 16 to potentially win 80, odds 5:1 (20% needed). Our hand has about maybe 5% equity vs typical range. Not enough.\n\nBut we are short stacked; we could consider shoving all-in (31) if raise allowed, but not allowed. So we must either call or fold. Folding preserves stack for better spot. Call would be a bluff call, but with only Ace high, not good.\n\nThus fold.\n\nWe should also consider opponent tendencies: Past actions: In hand 22, opponent bet 16 on flop with unknown hand (we don't know). In hand 23, they bet 8 then called 16, then checked turn and river. In hand 26, they bet 12 then called 24 (call after bet?), then bet 24 on turn. They seem to be aggressive and call down. Could be wide range. Still our hand is weak.\n\nThus fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Raise to 8 is small; could raise to 8 (i.e., 4 more) but that leaves 21 chips left, still short. Could also go all-in by raising to 29 (if allowed). The rules: If can't afford minimum raise, you can go all-in. But we can afford raise to 8. However, best play short stack is to push all-in to maximize fold equity. Opponents may call with wide range? In tournament early stage, they have deep stacks relative (206,229,324). They may call with any two cards? Probably not. So push may be good.\n\nBut we are UTG, QcKs is not premium for push; but with 7 BB, push is standard. So we should raise all-in.\n\nWe need to output JSON: action \"raise\", raise_to: 29 (total chips). Reasoning.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed; raise_to can be total amount.

So odds ~ 2/8 = 25% needed to break even. Our equity with K7 off-suit vs unknown range? Probably less than 25% unless we have some draws. We have no draw, just showdown value: maybe we have K high, could win if opponent has low cards like 2-6 combos? But board is paired 5s, opponent could have 5 for set, but they'd bet bigger. Small bet suggests maybe they are probing with air or medium hand.\n\nGiven tournament, stack 99 BB, not huge pressure. Might consider calling to see turn cheap, but risk losing chips.

With K7, we have gutshot? 5-5-3-10, need 9 for 9-10-J-Q-K? Not. Need 8 for 8-9-10-J-Q? Not. So no draw. Opponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) bet 2 into pot 10, so pot now 12 after bet? Actually before turn bet: pot was 10 (preflop and flop). Flop: seat4 bet 2, seat5 called 2 => pot 14. Turn: seat4 bets 2, amount to call 2, pot currently 14+2? Actually after flop pot 14. Turn bet 2 adds to pot 2, making pot 16 (including bet). To call 2 adds 2, making pot 18. So pot odds: call 2 to win 16? Actually if call, you get to win pot of 16 (current pot before call) + opponent's bet 2? Let's compute: pot before turn action = 14. Opponent bets 2, so pot becomes 16 (including his bet). You need to call 2 to win 16. So pot odds = 2/(16+2?) Wait you call 2 to win 16 (the opponent's bet is already in pot). So you invest 2 to win 16, odds 1:8. Need ~11% equity. But you have essentially zero equity (no pair). So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: maybe they are aggressive? Could be bluff?

Actually seat5 is us (BB). But actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 1 (so we are SB? But position says BB seat5. Possibly they treat seat5 as SB posting 1, then seat1 post_bb 2. So we are SB? Confusing. But amount to call is 1, meaning we need to call the big blind? Actually after SB posted 1, BB posted 2. Now it's our turn? Actually if we are BB, after posting BB we act first preflop? No, SB acts first, then BB, then UTG, etc. But all others folded. So after SB posted 1, BB posted 2, now it's our turn to act? Actually BB is seat5, we already posted 2, but we can raise or check (since we are already in blind). The amount to call is 1 (to call the SB's 1? But we already have 2, which is more than 1, so we could check (i.e., just continue) or raise. Legal actions include fold, call, raise. \"call\" would mean call the additional 1 to match the SB? That seems odd. Usually you can check (i.e., just continue) if no raise. But they give call as legal. So likely they treat that we need to call the SB's 1 to stay in the hand (i.e., we have posted BB 2, but we need to call the SB's 1? Actually we are already over the amount, but maybe they treat the BB as already posted and we can check. But they gave call as option. In any case, with 3h5d, we should fold or just call? Typically you'd just check (i.e., do nothing) because it's a dead blind. But they don't have check as legal action, only fold, call, raise. So \"call\" likely means just check (i.e., match the current bet). Since we are already over, call is just check. So we should call (i.e., check) rather than fold because it's a cheap hand and we can see flop cheap. But 3h5d is very weak, but still you can call the 1 to see flop for cheap. In tournament, with 97.5 BB, you could fold and preserve stack. But folding a BB blind loses 2 anyway. So you might as well call the 1 and see flop. However, 3h5d is low, but you could also raise to try to steal? Not advisable. So best: call.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Actually seat2 is BB, but seat2 raise 8 maybe from BB? Not sure). hand 2 preflop raise amount 6. So Kimi-K2 has raised preflop previously. No info about calling or folding.\n\nOur hand Qd6s is weak. On BTN, typical strategy: open raise with a wide range, but Q6 offsuit is marginal. With 97 BB stack, can consider a steal raise. But need to consider opponents: SB and BB have been raising preflop before, indicating they may be aggressive. However they have not yet acted in this hand. The SB already posted 1, BB posted 2, now it's our turn. We can raise to steal, but Q6 offsuit is not great for a raise that could be called and we could be dominated.\n\nGiven they are likely to defend the BB with a wide range, but SB might call with many hands. However we have a short stack? Actually 97 BB is decent.\n\nGiven the hand, I'd likely just call (i.e., just limp) or fold. But limping from BTN is not typical. Better to fold or raise? In tournament with 97 BB, you can afford to be selective. Q6 offsuit is a weak hand, not worth a raise. Could just call and see flop cheap, but that invites a raise from BB? Actually if we call, the pot becomes 5 chips (SB 1, BB 2, us 2). Then BB could raise, and we would be out of position.\n\nThus better to fold and preserve stack.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\n"

Need to decide preflop.\n\nWe have position (BTN) after SB and BB posted. We face a call of 2 (big blind). Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to 4 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: we have recall of Kimi-K2 raises: hand 1 preflop raise amount 8 (presumably from SB? Actually seat2 is BB, but seat2 raise 8 maybe from BB? Not sure). hand 2 preflop raise amount 6. So Kimi-K2 has raised preflop previously. No info about calling or folding.\n\nOur hand Qd6s is weak. On BTN, typical strategy: open raise with a wide range, but Q6 offsuit is marginal. With 97 BB stack, can consider a steal raise. But need to consider opponents: SB and BB have been raising preflop before, indicating they may be aggressive. However they have not yet acted in this hand. The SB already posted 1, BB posted 2, now it's our turn. We can raise to steal, but Q6 offsuit is not great for a raise that could be called and we could be dominated.\n\nGiven they are likely to defend the BB with a wide range, but SB might call with many hands. However we have a short stack? Actually 97 BB is decent.\n\nGiven the hand, I'd likely just call (i.e., just limp) or fold. But limping from BTN is not typical. Better to fold or raise? In tournament with 97 BB, you can afford to be selective. Q6 offsuit is a weak hand, not worth a raise. Could just call and see flop cheap, but that invites a raise from BB? Actually if we call, the pot becomes 5 chips (SB 1, BB 2, us 2). Then BB could raise, and we would be out of position.\n\nThus better to fold and preserve stack.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\n",

The actions: seat5 post_sb 1 (so seat5 is SB?), seat1 post_bb 2 (so seat1 is BB). Wait our position is BB (Seat5). But actions show seat5 posted SB 1, seat1 posted BB 2. That seems contradictory: maybe seat5 is SB (small blind) and seat1 is BB (big blind). However the description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So seat5 is BB, but they posted SB 1. Might be a mistake. Anyway we are in BB with As5h, after blinds posted, we face amount to call = 1 (so the SB posted 1, we posted 2 as BB, now we need to call 1 to match BB? Actually amount to call is 1 meaning the SB posted 1 and we posted 2, but the BB is already 2, so the amount to call is the SB's 1? Usually after blinds, the action is on UTG, but here only players left are seat1 (BB) and seat5 (SB). Wait seat2-4 folded. So only SB and BB remain. SB posted 1, BB posted 2. The action is on the SB (seat5) first preflop, they can check (i.e., just call 1 to match BB) or raise. The amount to call is 1 (i.e., they need to put 1 more to match the BB). So we are the SB (actually). But position says BB; but we treat as SB.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise total to 4 chips). So raise amount would be 4 total (so additional 3). Our hand As5h is weak unsuited Ace low kicker. In SB vs BB heads-up, typical play: you can raise or call. With A5 offsuit, it's marginal. Considering stack 97 BB deep, can we steal? The BB might fold many times? The BB is Kimi-K2 Thinking. We have recall: they raised preflop in hand #5 (previous hand) to amount 6 (maybe from SB to BB?). That indicates they may be aggressive. But we only have one data point.\n\nWe should consider tournament stage: early, stacks deep. We have Ace high, but not strong. Probably best to call (just see flop) rather than raise and risk. Since amount to call is just 1, calling is cheap. So action: call.\n\nThus output JSON: action call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Actually board shows turn is 4h (since board includes Kh Js 4c 4h). Wait board includes turn? Yes board shows 4 cards: Kh Js 4c 4h. So turn is 4h (a paired board: two 4s). Our hand still just Ace high. Opponent may have a hand like Kx, Jx, 44, etc. Could be a set (if they have 4x). Or two pair (KJ). Or a straight draw? Not really. Could be a flush draw? hearts: 4h gives two hearts (4h and our 5h). Not enough.\n\nGiven opponent checked, we could check back to see river cheap. Raising could be a bluff, but we have short stack? Actually we have 96.5 BB, not short. But raising here may be risky because opponent could have a strong hand. However we could consider a small raise to steal pot? Pot is 4, min raise is 2 (so raise to 4 total? Actually raise_to is total amount. Minimum raise to 2? Wait current bet is 0, min raise to 2 means we need to bet 2 chips. So we could bet 2. That's 50% pot. Could be a semi-bluff if we think opponent missed the board. But opponent may have a hand like KJ (two pair) which is strong. If we bet, they likely call or raise.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: early? Not given. But we have decent stack.\n\nWe can also check and see river.

So we can call 2, raise to at least 4 (i.e., raise 2 more). Our hand QJ offsuit (different suits). Position button. Stack 193, deep. Need to decide.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (seat2 BB) has raised preflop in past two hands: amounts 8 and 6 (over 2). That suggests they are raising 3-4x BB maybe as standard open raise? Could be a 3-bet? Actually they are BB, they cannot raise preflop unless someone raised before them. Wait seat1 SB posted 1, seat2 BB posted 2. No raise yet. So seat2 cannot raise preflop unless they are the first aggressor (open raise). So they are opening from BB (tight? maybe). They raised to 8 and 6 previously, which are 4x BB and 3x BB. So they are likely a standard raiser, perhaps tightish.\n\nOur hand QJ offsuit is decent but not premium. In BTN vs BB open, we can 3-bet or call. With deep stacks, we could raise to isolate. But need to consider tournament stage: we have 96.5 BB, deep, can be aggressive.\n\nGiven opponent's raises are 6-8 (3-4x), they may be opening a wide range? Not sure. QJ offsuit can be played profitably by 3-betting to apply pressure, especially on button. But also could call and see flop.\n\nWhat is pot size? 3 chips currently (SB+BB). If we raise to 4 (minimum), that is just a small raise (2 more). That would be a 2x raise (to 4). That might be too small, not standard. Could raise to maybe 12 (6x) to isolate. Minimum raise to 4, but we can raise higher. Need to consider legal raise amounts? Not specified, but we can raise to any amount up to our stack. Usually raise must be at least double the previous bet (so raise to at least 4). So we could raise to, say, 12.\n\nGiven opponent's typical open is 6-8, raising to 12 would be a 6x raise (3x BB). Might be a good 3-bet.\n\nBut also consider that we could just call and see flop, but QJ offsuit is vulnerable.\n\nI think we should raise to 12 to isolate and take initiative. Reason: position, decent hand, deep stacks, opponent likely raises wide.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 12.\n\nNow produce JSON."

So we can call 2, raise to at least 4 (i.e., raise 2 more). Our hand QJ offsuit (different suits). Position button. Stack 193, deep. Need to decide.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (seat2 BB) has raised preflop in past two hands: amounts 8 and 6 (over 2). That suggests they are raising 3-4x BB maybe as standard open raise? Could be a 3-bet? Actually they are BB, they cannot raise preflop unless someone raised before them. Wait seat1 SB posted 1, seat2 BB posted 2. No raise yet. So seat2 cannot raise preflop unless they are the first aggressor (open raise). So they are opening from BB (tight? maybe). They raised to 8 and 6 previously, which are 4x BB and 3x BB. So they are likely a standard raiser, perhaps tightish.\n\nOur hand QJ offsuit is decent but not premium. In BTN vs BB open, we can 3-bet or call. With deep stacks, we could raise to isolate. But need to consider tournament stage: we have 96.5 BB, deep, can be aggressive.\n\nGiven opponent's raises are 6-8 (3-4x), they may be opening a wide range? Not sure. QJ offsuit can be played profitably by 3-betting to apply pressure, especially on button. But also could call and see flop.\n\nWhat is pot size? 3 chips currently (SB+BB). If we raise to 4 (minimum), that is just a small raise (2 more). That would be a 2x raise (to 4). That might be too small, not standard. Could raise to maybe 12 (6x) to isolate. Minimum raise to 4, but we can raise higher. Need to consider legal raise amounts? Not specified, but we can raise to any amount up to our stack. Usually raise must be at least double the previous bet (so raise to at least 4). So we could raise to, say, 12.\n\nGiven opponent's typical open is 6-8, raising to 12 would be a 6x raise (3x BB). Might be a good 3-bet.\n\nBut also consider that we could just call and see flop, but QJ offsuit is vulnerable.\n\nI think we should raise to 12 to isolate and take initiative. Reason: position, decent hand, deep stacks, opponent likely raises wide.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 12.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

Usually order: SB seat4, BB seat5, then seat1 UTG, seat2, seat3, etc. But given seat1 and seat2 folded, seat3 raised. So we face a raise of 6, need to call 4.\n\nOur hand: 7h Th. It's a decent suited connector, decent potential for straight and flush, but not premium. Stack 194 chips ~97 BB, deep. Facing a raise of 3BB from presumably early position (maybe middle). We need to decide.\n\nWe should consider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 raised 6 previously (hand #8). Might be a standard raise range. We could call to see flop, but also could raise (3-bet) as a semi-bluff? 7hTh is not a strong 3-bet hand; could 3-bet for value vs weaker range? Probably not advisable. Better to call and see flop, especially with deep stack.\n\nBut also consider position: we are in BB, out of position post-flop. However, 7hTh is a decent hand to call in BB vs a raise from early position? Might be borderline. In tournaments early stage (blinds 1/2, stack 97 BB), we can be more liberal. The raise is 3BB, not huge. So calling is fine.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nWe must ensure raise_to is null.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

So we have a pair of tens, plus a straight draw? 7-8-9-10? No board has 2,2,T. So we have a pair of tens, kicker 7. Not great but top pair. Opponent (Seat3) raised preflop to 6 (from UTG maybe). He is DeepSeek-V3.2. We called. Now flop with pair on board: 2-2-T. He hasn't acted yet? The actions list only includes preflop. So now it's our turn (BB) after flop? Actually order: In flop, action starts with UTG (Seat3) then Seat4 (fold) then Seat5 (BB) etc. Since Seat3 raised preflop and we called, now flop action is first to act UTG (Seat3). The action list doesn't show any flop actions yet; it's our turn? Usually after flop, action starts with UTG (first active player left of button). That is Seat3. Since no flop actions listed, it's currently Seat3's turn? But the prompt says \"Your Position: BB (Seat5)\". And \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests it's our turn to act and nothing to call (i.e., previous player checked). So the opponent must have checked the flop. So we have the option to check or raise. We have top pair, decent hand. Opponent's tendencies unknown. Let's recall opponent actions on flop. Use recall_opponent_actions again for preflop maybe? But we can infer that he raised preflop and now checked flop. Could be a continuation bet? He didn't bet. So maybe he missed the flop, so checking suggests a weak hand. Could be a trap? But likely he's weak. So we could consider raising to protect our hand and extract value. Our stack is 190 chips, pot 13. Minimum raise is 4, meaning we can raise to 4 total? Actually raise to 4 means total bet of 4? Minimum raise to: 4 meaning we must put at least 4 chips total (i.e., raise 4). Since amount to call 0, raising to 4 would be a bet of 4 chips. That's small. Could we raise larger? Yes, we can raise any amount above min raise. We could bet maybe 8-10 chips to protect and get value. Opponent's stack 188, pot 13. A bet of say 8 would be about 1.5 BB. Might be fine.\n\nConsider tournament stage: early, stacks 95 BB, we can be aggressive. Opponent raised preflop, maybe strong. But flop is dry with 2-2-T. Our T is top pair, but opponent could have T with stronger kicker (like AJ, QJ, etc.) or a set of twos (unlikely). Also could have overcards like AK. But he checked, maybe he missed. So raising is good.\n\nThus action: raise to maybe 8 chips. Provide reasoning.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise allowed. So output JSON.\n\n",

Usually raise to 8 means total bet = 8. But current pot is 29, and no bet yet. So a bet of 8 would be a small raise.

Actually board has pair of deuces, we have Ten, so we have pair of tens, plus a flush draw? Suits: board: 2d,2c,Tc,4s. Our hand: 7h Th. So we have pair of tens, kicker 7. Potential: we have set? No. Overpair? Not overpair, it's pair. Straight possibilities: board has 2-2- T-4. We have 7, could get straight draw with 8-9? Not currently. So only pair.\n\nOpponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised preflop to 6 (from UTG maybe). We called with 7h Th from BB. Flop 2d 2c Tc: we bet 8, opponent called 8. So flop we led out, maybe representing strong. Opponent called.\n\nTurn 4s: we check, opponent bets 18 into pot 47? Actually pot after flop: preflop pot: 1+2+6+4 =13? Wait: preflop: SB 1, BB 2, raise 6, call 4 => total 1+2+6+4 =13? Actually raise to 6 includes the 2 from BB? No, raise 6 means total 6? Usually raise to 6 after SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6 from seat3, call 4 from seat5 (BB). So pot after preflop: 1+2+6+4 =13.\n\nFlop: we bet 8, opponent call 8 => pot now 13+8+8 =29. Turn: we check, opponent bets 18 => pot becomes 29+18 =47 (as given). So we need to decide.\n\nOur hand: top pair (tens) with weak kicker. Opponent's range: preflop raise from UTG (likely strong). They called flop bet, maybe they have T? Could be 2 pair (2s with T), set of 2s, or maybe a straight draw (like 9J, 8J, etc). Turn card 4s gives them maybe a flush draw? No spades: only 4s, we have no spades. So they could have a flush draw with spades? Actually board spade only 4s. They could have two spades in hand, giving flush draw. Not many combos.\n\nOur check might be considered weak; opponent bets. Should we call? Evaluate pot odds: pot 47, bet 18, so total pot after call 65. Need to call 18 to win 65 => odds 18/65 = 27.7%. Need equity >27.7%. Our hand vs opponent's range.\n\nWhat could opponent have? Since they raised preflop UTG, likely strong: high pairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT), AK, AQ, maybe A2s? They called flop bet, indicating they have decent hand or draw. Board: 2d 2c Tc. Our bet on flop could have been with T, we have T. Opponent may have 2x for set, or T? Could have overpair (AA, KK) that still call? Overpairs would call a small bet. Could also have straight draw like 9J (gives open-ended) or 8J? Actually board T,2,2. 9J gives gutshot? 9J would need 8 or Q for straight. Not immediate.\n\nTurn 4s: board now 2-2-T-4. This gives potential for a straight 3-4-5-6? Not relevant.\n\nOpponent bet 18, maybe representing a made hand like set of 2s, two pair (T2), or maybe a bluff.\n\nOur hand is weak top pair. Likely behind many of opponent's strong hands. But also many draws (flush draw spades, straight draws). Should we call? With 7h Th, we have backdoor flush? No hearts on board. Not.\n\nWe could raise? Minimum raise to 36, raising to 36 would be +18 extra. Does that make sense? Probably not.\n\nWe could fold to preserve stack. Our stack 182, still decent.\n\nGiven we have only top pair with weak kicker, and opponent's range is likely ahead, folding seems appropriate.\n\nBut we need to consider possibility opponent is semi-bluffing with spade flush draw. If they have spade flush draw, they have maybe A5s, K5s, etc. Our call would be okay if equity >27.7% vs that."

We have only 6, need 8 and 9. With J we can make straight 7-8-9-10-J need 8 and 9. So we have open-ended straight draw? Actually we have two outs combos: 8 and 9 both needed. That's a \"double gutshot\"? Let's evaluate: we have 6 and J, board 7, T, Q. The possible straight combos: 8-9 give straight 7-8-9-10-J (needs both 8 and 9). That's a double gutshot (needs two specific ranks). Also 8 gives 6-7-8-9-10? Wait need 8 and 9 for that too. So we need both 8 and 9. That's not a typical open-ended; it's a \"two-card combo\" draw (needs both of two ranks). So it's weaker. Also we have a flush draw? We have 6h and board has 7h, so we have two hearts, need two more hearts for flush (needs turn and river hearts). So we have backdoor flush draw.\n\nOur stack 179 chips, pot 6. Opponents (seat1 K1) and seat2 K2 (small blind and big blind) both checked. So we are first to act on BTN after checks. We have a weak draw. Should we check or bet? Consider pot odds: we can check and see if they bet. If they bet, we can call maybe. But we have limited stack; but still many chips.\n\nOpponent tendencies: K2 sometimes folds on flop, sometimes calls. Not much info. K1 also check. Likely they have weak hands.\n\nGiven we have a draw, maybe a small bet to take pot? But we have only 6 pot, minimum raise is 2 (so bet 2). That would be 2 into 6 = 33% pot, decent. Could try to steal? But they are in blinds, they might have decent hand like QJ, AQ, etc. Our hand is not strong. Betting could get us folds from weak, but we could also be called and we are behind.\n\nCheck is safe, we can see turn. Since we have a weak draw, we may want to see free card. So checking seems appropriate.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have AK hearts? Actually Th Ah (Ten hearts Ace hearts). So Ace Ten offsuit? Actually both hearts: Ten hearts and Ace hearts: A\u2665 T\u2665, suited Ace Ten (ATs). Good hand, strong. Position CO (cutoff). Preflop: seat2 posted small blind 1, seat3 posted big blind 2, seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 4. So raise from 2BB to 4 (2x BB). We have 179 chips stack.\n\nWe need to decide: call 4 (total pot after call would be 4+4+1+2? Actually pot currently 7 chips includes blinds 1+2+? plus raise 4? Let's compute: before action: SB 1, BB 2, then seat4 raise to 4 (meaning total bet 4). So pot = 1+2+4 =7 (as given). To call we need to put 4 total (so add 2 more? Actually we haven't posted any chips yet; to call we must put 4 chips, matching raise. So call cost = 4. Minimum raise to 6 (meaning raise total to 6). So raise amount would be 6 total (i.e., add 2 more than call). So we can raise to 6, or more.\n\nGiven hand ATs, position CO, raise is strong. Opponent MiniMax-M2's tendencies: from recall: they have raised preflop 4 in hand 6 and 11 (two raises). In hand 6 they raised 4 (same amount) and later bet big on flop/turn. So they are capable of raising with some strength, perhaps a wide range? Hand 14 they called preflop 2 (so they called a raise? Actually hand 14 they called 2? That suggests they called a raise of 2? Not sure. But overall they sometimes raise, sometimes fold.\n\nGiven we have a premium hand, we could 3-bet. Stack is deep (89.5 BB). Raising to 6 is minimal; we could raise larger to isolate and build pot. Considering tournament stage? Not given. But we have decent stack.\n\nWhat about other players behind us? No one else yet (we are CO, then button? Actually seat5 is us, seat6 maybe? Not listed. So after us, seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is next (UTG?), but they are in early position? Actually seat1 is after seat5? Table seats: 1,2,3,4,5. So after seat5, seat1 is next (the dealer maybe?). So we act before seat1, seat2, seat3, seat4 already acted. So only seat1 left to act after us. So we could raise to isolate MiniMax-M2 or we could just call and let others act.\n\nGiven ATs is a strong hand but not top of range for 3-bet vs unknown raise. However in tournament, you may want to 3-bet for value and to build pot. Opponent's raise size is small (2BB). So 3-betting to 6 is 3x raise (or 3x BB). Could also raise to like 12-15 to apply pressure. But we must consider stack depth and possible re-raise. MiniMax-M2 may 4-bet all-in? Unlikely with 89 BB.\n\nI think best is to raise to 6 (minimum) to take initiative and thin the field, and if seat1 calls we have a multi-way pot but still okay. Could also raise to 12 to isolate. Considering our hand is suited Ace Ten, we like to see flop. But also we could just call and see flop cheap. However raising gives us chance to win bigger pot and also maybe steal blinds later. I think raise.\n\nThus action: raise to 6. Reasoning: strong hand, position, opponent's raise small, want to build pot, isolate.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Preflop actions: SB posted 1, BB posted 2 (we are BB). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 4 (so open raise to 4). Then we (Seat5) raised to 6 (so 3-bet to 6). Seat1 called 6. Seats 2,3 folded. Then Seat4 re-raised to 8 (so a 4-bet to 8). So now we face a 4-bet to 8, we have already put 6 in, need to call 2 more to match 8. Minimum raise to 10 (so raise to 10 total). Our stack 173, we can call.\n\nWe need decide: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand AA is premium. Facing 4-bet from MiniMax-M2. Likely they have strong range. Could be AA, KK, maybe QQ, AK. We have AA, so we are ahead of most. Should we just call (flat) or 4-bet raise? The raise to 10 would be a 5-bet (but min raise is 10 total). So raise to 10 is just 2 more chips beyond call (i.e., 4 more total). That's minimal raise. Could also go all-in but not needed.\n\nGiven stack depth 86.5 BB, tournament stage unknown but early. We want to get value. The opponent 4-bet size is small (8). Raising to 10 would be a tiny raise, might be seen as a \"donk\" but could extract more. But we could also just call and see flop, but AA is strong.\n\nWe need consider that we are out of position (still BB vs UTG? Actually seat4 is maybe MP? But we are BB, after flop we will be out of position vs them). So we may want to build pot.\n\nGiven they 4-bet small, could be a bluff or a light 4-bet. Raising to 10 (i.e., 5-bet) is small; perhaps better to call and then see flop. But we have AA, we could also re-raise to maybe 12-14 to get more value. However min raise is 10, but we can raise higher? The legal actions: raise (no limit specified). Minimum raise to: 10. So we can raise to any amount >=10 up to our stack. So we could raise to, say, 30 to extract value. But we must consider opponent's likely range; they may have strong hands, but still we can get value.\n\nGiven tournament, we have a deep stack, we can raise to maybe 30-40 to protect against draws.\n\nBut also we risk them folding better hands? Actually they are already 4-bet, likely strong, they may call a reasonable raise.\n\nI think best is to raise to around 30 (i.e., 5-bet) to get value and protect.\n\nCheck legal: we can raise to any amount up to stack.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand: Th Ah (Ace Ten hearts). Board: 7h Qs 3c. We are BB with 149 chips. Pot 104 before flop? Actually after preflop action, pot now 104? The flop bet is 35 from MiniMax-M2 (Seat4). So we face 35 bet, pot currently 104 (including bet? Actually pot before bet was 104, then seat4 bets 35 making pot 139? But amount to call is 35, and we need to decide.\n\nOur hand: top pair? We have Ace high, not paired yet. Board: Q, 7, 3. No flush draw (we have hearts: Th, Ah, board has 7h, so we have a nut flush draw? Actually we have two hearts, board has one heart. So we have a flush draw: we have Ah and Th, board 7h. That's three hearts, need two more hearts for flush. So we have a nut flush draw (Ace high). Also we have overcards (A, T) to board. Potential straight draws? Not really.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 35 into pot 104. That's about 1/3 pot. Could be continuation bet. We have decent draw and overcards. Should we call? Pot odds: need 35 to win pot ~ (104+35*2?) Actually after call, pot will be 104 + 35 (bet) + 35 (call) = 174. So we need to invest 35 to win 174, odds = 35/174 = 20.1% needed. Our equity: With Ace Ten hearts vs unknown hand. Let's estimate: We have about 12 outs? Flush outs: need two more hearts: there are 13 hearts total, we have Ah, Th, board 7h, so remaining hearts = 10. Actually we have two hearts in hand, one on board, so 10 hearts left. Also straight draws? Not many. Overcards may pair. So approx 10 outs. 10 outs gives ~ 20% chance on turn (if one card left) and ~ 35% by river. Since two cards to come, equity maybe around 30%? So calling is profitable.\n\nAlso we have deep stack 149, can raise? Minimum raise to 70, raise would be 70 total, meaning raise additional 35. Might be good to raise as semi-bluff to put pressure. But we have only 35 to call; raising to 70 would be 35 more. Could we raise? Yes legal. Should we raise? Opponent might fold weaker hands, but also we could get called and we have equity.\n\nGiven we are out of position (BB vs opponent in seat4, who is likely in early position? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, preflop they raised, we 3-bet, they 4-bet? Wait preflop: seat4 raise 4, seat5 raise 6 (our 3-bet), seat1 call 6, seat4 raise 8 (4-bet to 8?), seat5 raise 30 (5-bet), seat4 call 22. So they called our 5-bet. So they are likely a strong hand preflop. They have likely a premium hand like AK, AQ, JJ, TT, maybe pocket pairs. Board Qs 7h 3c, they have Qx maybe. So they could have Qx, which is top pair. Our hand is Ace high, but we have nut flush draw and overcards. So a raise might be okay to protect against them calling with Qx.\n\nGiven they are likely strong, raising may fold out some weaker Q hands? Actually they already have Q? Might call. Raising might be too aggressive? But we have strong draw, can raise to 70 to make them pay more.\n\nConsider stack sizes: they have 111 chips (from table). So they have about 111. If we raise to 70, they would need to call 35 more (since they already bet 35). They could call 35 to see turn, leaving them with 76 chips left. They might fold if they think we have strong. Might be good.\n\nGiven pot odds and equity, a call is safe. Raising could be okay but risk they fold and we lose value? But we already have equity to call.\n\nThus I will call.\n\nReturn JSON.",

We have J on board, T in hand, need 9 and 8? Not correct. Let's examine: Straight possibilities with T: T-J-Q-K-A is a straight if we have K and A. We have A, board has Q,J, need K. So we have a gutshot for A-K-Q-J-10? Actually we have A and T, board Q,J. Need K to make Broadway? The straight would be T-J-Q-K-A; we have T and A, board has J, Q, need K. That's one card, not a gutshot, it's an open-ended? Actually we need K, only one rank. That's a gutshot? The missing card is K. So we have a \"inside\" straight draw needing exactly K. So probability about 4 outs (maybe 3 if K of same suit as something? No flush possibilities). Also we have a pair of Aces, which is top pair (since board has no Ace). Opponent seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) checked. Let's recall preflop: seat 4 raised to 4, we raised to 6, seat1 called 6, seat4 re-raised to 8, we reraise to 30, seat4 called 22. So preflop action: we 3-bet to 30, they called. So they likely have a strong hand. Flop: board 7h Qs 3c Jd. Seat4 bet 35, we called 35. So they bet on flop. That indicates they have something like a pair, maybe a straight draw, maybe a set, maybe a two pair, etc. Our hand AA is strong but not top? Actually they could have QJ, QJ, or maybe a set of 7s or 3s. But board: 7h Qs 3c Jd. They bet 35 into pot 139? Actually pot before flop? Preflop pot: contributions: seat4 4, seat5 6, seat1 6, seat4 8 (re-raise), seat5 30, seat4 call 22. Let's compute: seat4 initial raise 4, seat5 raise to 6 (call? Actually seat5 raise 6). seat1 call 6. Then seat4 re-raise to 8 (meaning raise to 8? Actually they raise to 8, we raise to 30, seat1 folds, seat4 calls 22). So total preflop: seat4 put 8+22=30? Actually seat4 initially 4, then 8, then call 22 => total 34? Let's not compute exactly. Anyway flop pot 139, they bet 35, we called. So now pot after flop call: 139+35+35 = 209. Turn is now. They checked. So they might be pot controlling.\n\nOur stack 114, we have 57 BB, pot 139? Actually pot before turn actions? The pot listed is 139 chips (maybe after flop betting? Actually the header says Pot: 139 chips. That likely is the pot before flop betting? Wait after flop actions, pot should increase. But they list pot 139 before turn actions. Possibly they show pot after flop betting? Let's assume pot is 139 before turn, then flop bet 35 each adds 70 => pot 209. But they still show pot 139 maybe they didn't update. Anyway.\n\nWe have a strong hand (top pair top kicker). Opponent checked. We can check back, or we can raise to protect against draws. Considering they have a straight draw (needs K), also possible flush draw? Board hearts: 7h, Qs, 3c, Jd. No flush draw. So only straight draw. Also they could have a pair like QJ (two pair), or a set of 7s (unlikely). But they bet flop, maybe they have QJ? Actually QJ would be two pair, they'd bet. On"

That's two pair, beats us? Actually two pair QJ vs our pair of Aces: Aces higher pair, we win. Two pair QJ is lower than pair of Aces?

So we are likely ahead but not guaranteed.\n\nGiven they checked, maybe they are pot controlling with medium hand. We could check to see river.

Actually raise_to total 35? That's just a small raise). Could raise to 70 to charge draws.\n\nWe need to decide. Considering tournament, stack 57 BB, still decent.

Only one heart on board, we have heart Ten, so two hearts. Not flush. So we have Ace-high, not a strong hand. Opponent MiniMax-M2 (seat4) has 41 chips left (short stack). Preflop they raised to 4, we 3-bet to 6, they called, then they 4-bet to 8? Actually actions: preflop: seat4 raise 4 (open). seat5 raise 6 (3-bet). seat1 call 6. seat2 fold, seat3 fold. seat4 raise 8 (4-bet). seat5 raise 30 (5-bet). seat1 fold. seat4 call 22 (call 30? Actually seat5 raised to 30, seat4 call 22 to match? Wait seat5 raise to 30, meaning total bet 30? Preflop pot: small blind 1 from seat2, big blind 2 from seat3. Then seat4 raise to 4 (so 2 more). seat5 raise to 6 (so 2 more). seat1 call 6. seat4 raise to 8 (so 2 more). seat5 raise to 30 (so 22 more). seat4 call 22 (so matches 30). So preflop they are all-in? Not yet, they have 41 chips left after posting 2? Actually seat4 had 41 chips total; they posted 2 as big blind? Wait seat4 is CO? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, position? Not given but seat4 is maybe CO or something. They raised to 4 (so they posted 2 as blind? Actually blinds are seat2 SB, seat3 BB. So seat4 is not blind; they raised to 4 (cost 4). seat5 (us) raise to 6 (cost 6). seat1 call 6. seat4 raise to 8 (cost 8). seat5 raise to 30 (cost 30). seat4 call 22 (cost 22). So seat4's total contribution: 4 + 8 + 22 = 34? Actually they initially put 4, then 8 (additional 4?), then call 22 (additional 22?). Not sure. But they have 41 chips, after putting 34 they'd have 7 left? Actually they may be all-in soon. After preflop, pot size: small blind 1, big blind 2, seat4 4, seat5 6, seat1 6, seat4 additional 8, seat5 raise to 30, seat4 call 22 => seat5 contributed 30, seat4 contributed 22, seat1 folded. So seat4 total contributions: 4+8+22=34. seat5 total: 6+30=36? plus blind? seat5 is BB? Actually seat5 is BB, posted 2. So seat5's total: 2 (big blind) + 4 (raise to 6?) Wait they raised to 6 after seat4 raise to 4, so they put 4 more? Actually they already posted 2 as BB, then raise to 6 means they add 4. Then later raise to 30 (additional 24). So total: 2+4+24=30. But the raise to 30 is total bet of 30, not additional. So they put 30 total preflop, which includes the 2 BB. So contributions: seat5 30, seat4 34? So seat4 may be short stack, but they still have chips left after call? They had 41, contributed 34, left 7. So after flop, seat4 bets 35, seat5 calls 35. That likely puts seat4 all-in (since they only have 7 left, they cannot bet 35). Wait seat4 bet 35, but they only have 7 left, so they'd be all-in for 7? Something off. Maybe stack numbers are after posting blinds? Let's not overthink. At river, seat4 checks, we have option to check or bet? Legal actions: fold, check (no raise). So we cannot raise because min raise is 70 but not allowed? Actually legal actions: fold, check. So we cannot raise; maybe because seat4 is all-in? Actually seat4 may"

We have amount to call 0, can check or raise. With 9-3 offsuit, extremely weak. Should we check and hope to see flop cheap? In BB with weak hand and a caller, checking is typical.

          "content": "We are on turn. Board: Kd Jc Kh 2d. So we have a full house? Actually board: Kd Jc Kh 2d => Pair of Kings on board, plus a Jack. Our hand: 9s 3h, so we have no pair, just 9-high. The board is paired Kings, so there is a full house possible for opponents if they have a King or a Jack. Also there is a possible straight draw? Board: K J K 2, no. So we have a very weak hand.\n\nWe are in BB, stack 42 chips, pot 5 chips. It's turn. No bet yet on turn (since actions show amount to call 0). So we can check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. There's no bet to call. So we could check. Raising would be a bluff. But given we have 9-3, very weak. Opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) called preflop, then checked flop. Likely they have something like a King, maybe a Jack, maybe a draw. On turn, board shows two Kings, making a full house possible if they have a King or a Jack. They might have a hand like Kx, Jx, maybe a set? Actually set of Kings not possible because only two Kings on board. If they have a King, they'd have trips (three Kings) and board also has a King pair, making full house? Wait board has two Kings, they have one King, that makes three Kings. The board also has a Jack, so they have three Kings and a Jack on board: that's a full house Kings over Jacks? Actually full house is three of a kind plus a pair. They have three Kings (two on board + one in hand) and the board also has a pair of Kings? Wait board has two Kings, not a pair of Jacks. The board is Kd Jc Kh 2d. That's two Kings, one Jack, one 2. If they hold a King, they'd have three Kings, plus the board's Jack is a singleton, and the 2 is a singleton. So they'd have three Kings, not a full house yet. They need a pair on board to make a full house: they have three Kings, board has a pair of Kings? Actually board has two Kings, that's a pair. So they'd have a full house: Kings full of Jacks? Let's think: hand: K?; board: K K J 2. They have K (one). So total Kings: three (two board + one hand). For a full house you need three of a kind plus a pair. The pair could be the two Kings on board, but those are already used in the three-of-a-kind? In Texas Hold'em, you choose any five cards from the seven. So they could choose three Kings (two board + one hand) and the pair of Jacks? But only one Jack on board. They need a pair of something else, maybe the 2? There's only one 2. So they cannot make a full house with just one King. Actually full house requires a pair of some rank. They have three Kings, need a pair of another rank. The board has a Jack and a 2, each singletons. So they don't have a pair. So they have just three of a kind (trip Kings). That's a strong hand but not full house. If they have a Jack, they'd have two Jacks (one board, one hand) plus pair of Kings on board, making full house Jacks full of Kings? Actually they'd have two Jacks (one board, one hand) and two Kings on board => that's two pair, not full house. Need three of a kind of one rank. So if they have a Jack, they'd have pair of Jacks plus pair of Kings (two pair). So best possible is trips Kings if they have a King, or two pair if they have a Jack, or maybe a straight draw? No.\n\nThus our hand is very weak. Likely we should check and hope opponent checks back, then we might fold later. Since we have no chance, we should check. There's no bet to call. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions include raise, but raising is a bluff, but we have short stack 42 chips, still enough. But raising may get us all-in if opponent folds? Opponent might call with any decent hand. Bluff may be okay but risk losing chips. Considering tournament, we have 21 BB, not huge but not short. We can preserve chips.\n\nThus we choose check.\n\nReturn JSON."

          "reasoning_content": "We are on turn. Board: Kd Jc Kh 2d. So we have a full house? Actually board: Kd Jc Kh 2d => Pair of Kings on board, plus a Jack. Our hand: 9s 3h, so we have no pair, just 9-high. The board is paired Kings, so there is a full house possible for opponents if they have a King or a Jack. Also there is a possible straight draw? Board: K J K 2, no. So we have a very weak hand.\n\nWe are in BB, stack 42 chips, pot 5 chips. It's turn. No bet yet on turn (since actions show amount to call 0). So we can check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. There's no bet to call. So we could check. Raising would be a bluff. But given we have 9-3, very weak. Opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) called preflop, then checked flop. Likely they have something like a King, maybe a Jack, maybe a draw. On turn, board shows two Kings, making a full house possible if they have a King or a Jack. They might have a hand like Kx, Jx, maybe a set? Actually set of Kings not possible because only two Kings on board. If they have a King, they'd have trips (three Kings) and board also has a King pair, making full house? Wait board has two Kings, they have one King, that makes three Kings. The board also has a Jack, so they have three Kings and a Jack on board: that's a full house Kings over Jacks? Actually full house is three of a kind plus a pair. They have three Kings (two on board + one in hand) and the board also has a pair of Kings? Wait board has two Kings, not a pair of Jacks. The board is Kd Jc Kh 2d. That's two Kings, one Jack, one 2. If they hold a King, they'd have three Kings, plus the board's Jack is a singleton, and the 2 is a singleton. So they'd have three Kings, not a full house yet. They need a pair on board to make a full house: they have three Kings, board has a pair of Kings? Actually board has two Kings, that's a pair. So they'd have a full house: Kings full of Jacks? Let's think: hand: K?; board: K K J 2. They have K (one). So total Kings: three (two board + one hand). For a full house you need three of a kind plus a pair. The pair could be the two Kings on board, but those are already used in the three-of-a-kind? In Texas Hold'em, you choose any five cards from the seven. So they could choose three Kings (two board + one hand) and the pair of Jacks? But only one Jack on board. They need a pair of something else, maybe the 2? There's only one 2. So they cannot make a full house with just one King. Actually full house requires a pair of some rank. They have three Kings, need a pair of another rank. The board has a Jack and a 2, each singletons. So they don't have a pair. So they have just three of a kind (trip Kings). That's a strong hand but not full house. If they have a Jack, they'd have two Jacks (one board, one hand) plus pair of Kings on board, making full house Jacks full of Kings? Actually they'd have two Jacks (one board, one hand) and two Kings on board => that's two pair, not full house. Need three of a kind of one rank. So if they have a Jack, they'd have pair of Jacks plus pair of Kings (two pair). So best possible is trips Kings if they have a King, or two pair if they have a Jack, or maybe a straight draw? No.\n\nThus our hand is very weak. Likely we should check and hope opponent checks back, then we might fold later. Since we have no chance, we should check. There's no bet to call. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions include raise, but raising is a bluff, but we have short stack 42 chips, still enough. But raising may get us all-in if opponent folds? Opponent might call with any decent hand. Bluff may be okay but risk losing chips. Considering tournament, we have 21 BB, not huge but not short. We can preserve chips.\n\nThus we choose check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K? No Q missing. 8-9-10-J-Q? Q missing. So no straight. There's a pair of Kings. So board is pair of Kings. Our hand 9s 3h gives us just high card 9. Not a pair.

Amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call 0, we can check. Should we raise? Typically with weak hand we check. But maybe we can bluff? Opponent may have missed the board and we could try steal. But we have no information about opponent tendencies. Let's recall opponent's actions earlier in hand: They called preflop 2, then checked flop and turn. So they are passive. Could be they have a weak hand like a missed draw. River: board shows K K J T 2. Opponent may have a King (makes trips) or a Jack, Ten (makes two pair), or a 2 (makes full house? Actually 2 with board gives two pair 2s and Ks? Actually board has 2 only one, so 2 + pair of Kings = two pair K's and 2's). Could have a straight draw? Not possible. Could have a flush? No two clubs: Jc, maybe other clubs? Not enough. So opponent's range likely includes Kx (makes trips), Jx (makes two pair), Tx (makes two pair), 2x (makes two pair), maybe a 9? 9 with board gives 9 high, not good. So they likely have a decent hand.

He posted BB 4, we are SB? Actually we are BB seat5, posted BB 4. Seat2 posted SB 2 then folded. So we are in BB, facing a raise? No one raised; only blinds posted. So amount to call is 2 (the SB). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total). So we can call 2 to see flop, raise to 8, or fold (unlikely). Hand KJ offsuit (Jc Kd) is decent but not premium. In BB with short stack 35 chips (8.8 BB). Need to consider tournament stage; short stack, need to accumulate chips. 8 BB is moderate; we could consider a steal raise? But we are BB, the SB already posted 2. The SB is a short stack? Seat2 folded. So only opponent left is the big stack (Seat1) who is in BB? Wait seat1 is BB? Actually seat1 posted BB 4; seat5 is our seat, we are BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". But seat1 posted BB 4, seat5 posted SB 2? Actually actions: \"preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 2\" then \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 4\". So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But the problem says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". That's contradictory. Probably they consider seat5 as BB because they are in the big blind seat (maybe they reversed). But actions show seat5 posted SB. Might be a mistake. However, amount to call is 2 (SB). So we are in BB and need to call 2 to match SB? Actually in BB you would call the SB's raise? Wait scenario: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, then action goes to player left of BB (UTG) but all folded. So after blinds, action is on the player after BB (i.e., UTG) but all folded, so next is SB? Actually in heads-up, SB acts first preflop, then BB. But here many folded, so after SB, next is BB (us). Since SB posted 2, we have already posted BB 4, but we can either check (i.e., just continue) or raise. The amount to call is 2 (the SB). Since we already have 4 in pot, we need to call 2 to match SB's bet? Actually SB's bet is 2, BB posted 4, but that is a blind, not a bet. The effective bet is 2 from SB; BB can either check (i.e., not raise) or raise. To check, we need to put in 0 additional chips, but the amount to call is 2? Wait typical rules: After blinds, the action is on the player left of BB. If all others fold, the SB acts first; they can either check (i.e., just call the BB) or raise. But SB already posted 2, BB posted 4, so SB is effectively 2 under BB. So SB can check (i.e., just call the BB) meaning they add 2 to match BB? Actually in heads-up, the SB is the small blind and acts first; they have the option to raise or check (i.e., just call the big blind). If they check, they need to put in 2 more to match the BB's 4, making the total 4 each. So the amount to call for BB is 2 (the additional amount needed to match the SB's check). So BB can either check (i.e., call 0) or raise. In many implementations, BB can check (i.e., just continue) and no further chips are required.

Actually the BB already has 4 in, SB had 2, but to check they must add 2 to make 4, but the system says amount to call is 2, meaning BB must put 2 more to call SB's check? That seems odd.

He posted BB 4, we are SB? Actually we are BB seat5, posted BB 4. Seat2 posted SB 2 then folded. So we are in BB, facing a raise? No one raised; only blinds posted. So amount to call is 2 (the SB). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total). So we can call 2 to see flop, raise to 8, or fold (unlikely). Hand KJ offsuit (Jc Kd) is decent but not premium. In BB with short stack 35 chips (8.8 BB). Need to consider tournament stage; short stack, need to accumulate chips. 8 BB is moderate; we could consider a steal raise? But we are BB, the SB already posted 2. The SB is a short stack? Seat2 folded. So only opponent left is the big stack (Seat1) who is in BB? Wait seat1 is BB? Actually seat1 posted BB 4; seat5 is our seat, we are BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". But seat1 posted BB 4, seat5 posted SB 2? Actually actions: \"preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 2\" then \"preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 4\". So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But the problem says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". That's contradictory. Probably they consider seat5 as BB because they are in the big blind seat (maybe they reversed). But actions show seat5 posted SB. Might be a mistake. However, amount to call is 2 (SB). So we are in BB and need to call 2 to match SB? Actually in BB you would call the SB's raise? Wait scenario: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, then action goes to player left of BB (UTG) but all folded. So after blinds, action is on the player after BB (i.e., UTG) but all folded, so next is SB? Actually in heads-up, SB acts first preflop, then BB. But here many folded, so after SB, next is BB (us). Since SB posted 2, we have already posted BB 4, but we can either check (i.e., just continue) or raise. The amount to call is 2 (the SB). Since we already have 4 in pot, we need to call 2 to match SB's bet? Actually SB's bet is 2, BB posted 4, but that is a blind, not a bet. The effective bet is 2 from SB; BB can either check (i.e., not raise) or raise. To check, we need to put in 0 additional chips, but the amount to call is 2? Wait typical rules: After blinds, the action is on the player left of BB. If all others fold, the SB acts first; they can either check (i.e., just call the BB) or raise. But SB already posted 2, BB posted 4, so SB is effectively 2 under BB. So SB can check (i.e., just call the BB) meaning they add 2 to match BB? Actually in heads-up, the SB is the small blind and acts first; they have the option to raise or check (i.e., just call the big blind). If they check, they need to put in 2 more to match the BB's 4, making the total 4 each. So the amount to call for BB is 2 (the additional amount needed to match the SB's check). So BB can either check (i.e., call 0) or raise. In many implementations, BB can check (i.e., just continue) and no further chips are required. The amount to call being 2 suggests that the SB has checked, adding 2 to bring to 4, and BB now needs to call 2 to match?

In BB, can either call 2 (i.e., just match SB) or raise to 8 min. Considering stack size, raising could be good to steal blinds, but opponent (Seat1) is big stack, could call. KJ is decent, but against a big stack, maybe we can raise to apply pressure. Since we are short, we might want to be aggressive. Minimum raise to 8 total (i.e., add 4 more chips beyond our 4?). Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Our current blind is 4, so raise_to 8 means we add 4 more. That would be a raise of 4 (to 8 total). That is a small raise, but could be a steal. Might be okay.\n\nAlternatively, we could just call and see flop, but KJ off-suit is vulnerable. With 8 BB, we want to avoid being stuck. I'd lean to raise to 8 to try to win blinds, especially since SB is out (folded) and only opponent is big stack in BB? Wait we are BB, the only other active player is seat1 (the big blind) who already posted 4 and is also our opponent? Actually seat1 is the big blind (BB). So we are SB? This is confusing. Let's assume we are BB, SB folded, so only we and seat1 (big blind) remain? But seat1 is BB, we are BB? Something off. Possibly we are SB and seat1 is BB. In that case, we are SB with KJ, SB posted 2, BB posted 4, we act first preflop. Amount to call is 2 (i.e., we need to call 2 more to match BB). So we can call 2 (making total 4 each) or raise to 8 total (i.e., raise by 4). That seems plausible. So we are SB, acting first. In that case, raising is standard to steal BB.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #26 preflop. Position CO (cutoff), stack 47 chips (11.8 BB). Blinds 2/4, so big blind is 4, small blind 2. Pot currently 14 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 8? Actually seat 2 posted sb 2, seat3 posted bb 4, seat4 raise 8, so raise from 4 to 8? Wait raise amount is 8 total, meaning raise to 8? Usually raise to 8 means total bet 8. So amount to call is 8, min raise to 12. So we need to decide fold/call/raise.\n\nOur hand: 6s Td (6 of spades, Ten of diamonds). Not a premium hand. In cutoff, with short stack (11.8 BB). Options: call 8 (which is 2 BB) to see flop, but stack is 47, after call we have 39 left. That's okay. However 6T is a marginal hand, not suited, not connected. Could be a steal attempt? But we are not the initial raiser; seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8. That is a small raise, about 2 BB. Might be a wide open raise from cutoff (since seat4 is button? Actually seat4 is position after us? Wait seats: seat1, seat2, seat3, seat4, seat5 (us). So seat4 is the player to our left? Actually positions: seat5 is CO, seat6 would be BTN (but only 5 seats?), maybe 5 players? Actually we have seats 1-5, so seat5 is CO, seat1 is UTG? Not sure. But seat4 is presumably the button (since seat5 is CO, seat4 is BTN). So button raised to 8. That is a standard open raise of 2 BB. So we face a raise from button. Our hand 6T is not a good call. With short stack we could consider going all-in (47) as a shove? That's too much compared to raise size. But we could also raise (shove) as a 3-bet all-in to steal blinds? However 6T is not a strong hand to 3-bet. But we have short stack; could be considered a push/fold strategy. At 12 BB effective stack, the push/fold chart suggests with 6T we might push from CO? Typically with 11.8 BB, push/fold ranges are fairly wide, but 6T off-suit is maybe marginal. Usually you push with any Ace, any pair, broadway combos, suited connectors, and maybe some suited one-gappers. Off-suit Ten-Six is usually not a push. So likely fold.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 raises small (4 BB) sometimes, but we have data: they raised 4 in previous hands (small). Could be a wide range. But still 6T off-suit is weak.\n\nThus best action: fold.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. So we choose fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

With only 10.8 BB we want to build a pot when ahead and avoid playing out of position with a marginal call. Raising to the minimum (12 total) isolates the SB, puts pressure on their range, and leaves us enough chips to continue if we get called.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have As Js (Ace high, suited). In BB with 10.8 BB stack (43 chips). SB posted 2, BB 4. Player in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8 (i.e., 8 total? Actually raise to 8 means they put 8 total, which is 4 over BB? Wait: preflop: Seat 4 post_sb 2 (they are SB). Seat 5 post_bb 4 (us). Then seat 4 raise 8. So they raised to 8 total, meaning they added 6 more (since they already had 2). So amount to call is 4 (difference between 8 and 4). Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise to 12 total). So we can call 4 to see flop, or raise to at least 12.\n\nOur hand AsJs is strong suited ace, good for 3-bet. Stack is shortish 10.8 BB, but still enough to 3-bet. Consider opponent: MiniMax-M2's preflop raise pattern: from recall, they have raised 8 (hand #26) and 12 (hand #27). Not many data, but they might be raising wide? Also they called 10 in hand 23 (maybe they called a raise). No fold data? They folded some times. We need to decide.\n\nIn early tournament, 10.8 BB is low stack; we might want to preserve chips but also try to double up. AsJs is a good hand for 3-bet, especially against a raise from SB (they are in position, but we are out of position in BB). However 3-bet size: Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise to 12 total). That would be 8 more chips (since we already have 4 in pot). That would be 12 total put in, meaning we add 8 more (so our total contribution becomes 12). That would be a 3-bet of 8 extra (so raise amount = 8). That's small relative to stack but typical for short stack? With 43 chips, a raise to 12 leaves us 31 chips left (approx 7.75 BB). If we get called, pot will be 12 (original) + 8 (our raise) + 4 (call) = 24? Wait compute: Initially pot 12 (SB 2 + BB 4). SB raises to 8 (adds 6). So pot now 12 (2+4+6). To call we need 4 more. If we raise to 12, we add 8 (12-4). Then pot becomes 12 + 8 (our raise) = 20, plus SB's call 4 later maybe. Actually if they call, they add 4, making pot 24.\n\nIs 3-bet advisable? AsJs vs SB's raise. Could also consider folding? Not good. Call? With 10.8 BB, calling 4 gives us 8 effective stack after flop? Actually we would have 39 chips left (43-4). In pot 12+4=16. So pot odds: 4 to call for 16 pot, 25% chance needed. AsJs is decent but not premium; but we have position? No, we are out of position (BB vs SB). After flop we will be first to act. Might be okay.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we want to be aggressive. 3-bet could isolate and get heads-up with good hand. AsJs is good for 3-bet. So raise to 12 seems good.\n\nConsider opponent's tendencies: They have raised to 12 before, maybe they are capable of 3-betting themselves? Not known. But we have Ace high, could dominate many hands.\n\nThus decision: raise to 12.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Seat4 raise 8 (so from 2 to 8? Actually raise to 8 total). Then seat5 (us) raise to 12 (so we re-raised to 12). Then seat4 raise to 16 (so they 3-bet to 16). Now amount to call is 4 (they raised from 12 to 16, so we need to call 4 more). Minimum raise to 20 (so we could raise to at least 20 total). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have A\u2660 J\u2660. Position: BB, short stack 35, effective stacks: opponent seat4 likely has larger stack 296 chips. We are deepish? 35 chips is 8.8 BB, short stack. The opponent 3-bet to 16 (4x SB). Our stack after posting 4 is 35; after our 12 raise we have 35-12 = 23 left? Wait we posted 4 initially, then raised to 12 total (i.e., added 8 more). So we have 35-12 = 23 chips left. Opponent raised to 16 total, we need call 4 more, leaving us 19 chips after call. Minimum raise to 20 would be total bet of 20, meaning we would need to add 8 more (since already at 12). That would be a 4-bet to 20 total, leaving us 15 chips left (since 35-20 = 15). That's a big commitment: 20 chips is >50% of stack.\n\nHand AsJs is strong but not premium for short stack vs 3-bet. Against a 3-bet from unknown opponent (MiniMax-M2) we need to consider their range: could be strong (AA, KK, QQ, AK) or also suited connectors, etc. With 8.8 BB, we might consider either calling and seeing flop (if implied odds) or shoving all-in. The raise to 20 is not all-in; all-in would be 35 (or 31 after call?). Actually all-in would be 35 total, but we can't raise to 35 because min raise is 20; we could raise to 35 (all-in) as a raise. So we could go all-in.\n\nGiven stack short, typical tournament strategy: either fold or go all-in (or maybe call). With AJs, calling 4 more (to 16) leaves us 19 chips left, still short. After call, we will be out of position preflop (we're in BB). Postflop we have 19 chips left; effective stack 19 vs opponent's 280+? Actually opponent's stack after raising 16, they have 296-16 = 280 left. So we are extremely short; we will be forced to go all-in on any flop bet. So calling is effectively a flop all-in scenario. That is okay if AJs has decent equity vs opponent's 3-bet range. But with such a short stack, we should consider shoving all-in now to maximize fold equity? But we are already short; raising to 20 is only 5 more chips, not much. All-in would be 35 total, which is 15 more chips than calling. Might be too much; but if we think opponent can fold to a 4-bet, we could steal. However with AJs, against a 3-bet we may be ahead of some but behind AA, KK, QQ, AK. 3-bet from SB could be wide, but they are likely strong. The pot currently: after their 16 raise, pot is 28 (initial) + 8 (their raise?) Let's compute: initial pot 28 includes blinds? Actually pot 28 chips after posting blinds? Not sure. Anyway.\n\nGiven we are short and have decent hand, calling seems reasonable to see flop. But we need to consider tournament stage: stack 35 chips, blinds 2/4, we have about 9 BB, not in danger of blind steal. Might want to preserve chips. If we call and lose, we go down to 19 chips (~4.75 BB). That's still playable. If we fold, we lose 12 chips (our raise) and are left with 23 chips (5.75 BB). Actually we already raised to 12, but if we fold now we lose 12 chips? Wait we have already put 12 into pot; folding now means we lose that 12, leaving 23 chips. That's okay.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #28, flop. Our hand As Js. Board Qc 6d 8c. We are in BB (seat 5). Stack 31 chips (7.8 BB). Pot 48. Opponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) bet 16. Amount to call 16, min raise 32, legal actions fold, call. So cannot raise (maybe because min raise exceeds stack? Actually min raise to 32 would be total 32, which is less than our stack 31? Wait stack 31, cannot raise to 32, so raise not legal; only fold or call). So decision: call or fold.\n\nWe need to consider hand strength: As Js gives us Ace high, gutshot? Actually board Qc 6d 8c, we have open-ended straight draw? Let's see: we have A and J. Straight possibilities: 9-10? With J, we need 10 and 9 for straight? Actually board: Q,6,8. We have J, A. Straight draws: we have J, need 10 and 9 to make straight (J-10-9-8-7? Not). Actually we have J, board 8,6, Q. No straight draw. Flush? Board has clubs: Qc, 8c. We have As (spade) and Js (spade). No clubs. So only Ace high, maybe pair of J? No J on board. So we have Ace high, maybe top pair? No. So we are likely behind. Opponent's bet 16 into 48 pot (33% pot). Could be a continuation bet with many hands, including Qx, 8x, 6x, draws, etc. Our stack is short (31). We are short-stacked (7.8 BB). Pot odds: need to call 16 to win 48+16=64? Actually pot is 48 before bet, opponent bet 16, so total pot after call = 48+16+16 = 80? Wait typical: pot 48, opponent bets 16, we call 16, pot becomes 48+16+16 = 80. So we need to call 16 to potentially win 80, odds 5:1 (20% needed). Our hand has about maybe 5% equity vs typical range. Not enough.\n\nBut we are short stacked; we could consider shoving all-in (31) if raise allowed, but not allowed. So we must either call or fold. Folding preserves stack for better spot. Call would be a bluff call, but with only Ace high, not good.\n\nThus fold.\n\nWe should also consider opponent tendencies: Past actions: In hand 22, opponent bet 16 on flop with unknown hand (we don't know). In hand 23, they bet 8 then called 16, then checked turn and river. In hand 26, they bet 12 then called 24 (call after bet?), then bet 24 on turn. They seem to be aggressive and call down. Could be wide range. Still our hand is weak.\n\nThus fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Need to decide.\n\nShort stack UTG, QcKs is decent but not premium. With 7.2 BB, typical push/fold. Should consider shove (all-in) maybe. But legal actions only fold, call, raise. Raise to 8 is small; could raise to 8 (i.e., 4 more) but that leaves 21 chips left, still short. Could also go all-in by raising to 29 (if allowed). The rules: If can't afford minimum raise, you can go all-in. But we can afford raise to 8. However, best play short stack is to push all-in to maximize fold equity. Opponents may call with wide range? In tournament early stage, they have deep stacks relative (206,229,324). They may call with any two cards? Probably not. So push may be good.\n\nBut we are UTG, QcKs is not premium for push; but with 7 BB, push is standard. So we should raise all-in.\n\nWe need to output JSON: action \"raise\", raise_to: 29 (total chips). Reasoning.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed; raise_to can be total amount. So we raise all-in.\n\n",

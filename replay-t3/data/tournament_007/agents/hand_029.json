Looking at my hand history, I've been playing tight (only 4 wins out of 28 hands, lots of folds). \n\nThe table dynamics: Seat 2 (another Kimi-K2) has already folded. I'm first to act after the blinds. The players behind me include MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) who has been quite aggressive - raising preflop in multiple hands (26, 27, 28). GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) has a very short stack of only 29 chips (7.25 BB).\n\nFrom my opponent recall:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, seat 1) has mostly folded preflop, but did call once and then raised on the flop in hand 26.\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) is aggressive, raising preflop frequently.\n\nWith Q7o from UTG, this is an easy fold. I have position disadvantage, weak hand, and aggressive players behind me who could easily 3-bet. Even if I limp, I'll be out of position with a weak hand against potentially multiple opponents.\n\nMy stack is 235 chips (58.8 BB), which is healthy but not massive. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots. The short stack at seat 5 (29 chips) might be looking to shove soon, so I don't want to get involved with marginal hands.\n\nGiven all this, folding is the clear decision.",

Minimum raise to 8 means raise total to 8 (so add 4 more). We have 7s6s suited connectors, decent for a short stack? At 7.2 BB, we could consider shoving all-in (29) or maybe call and see flop? But with 7s6s, it's a speculative hand. In tournament early stage? Stack is short relative to blinds (2/4). 7 BB is short but not ultra short. If we call 2, we will be at 27 left, and we will see flop out of position (still in BB, after SB calls). The SB may have a wide range, but we will be out of position. With 7s6s, we could try to steal blind? Not possible. Better to fold or maybe call as a speculative hand? At 7 BB, calling 2 is cheap, but playing out of position with a marginal hand may be okay if we hope to hit a straight/flush. However, risk of being dominated.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, preserving chips is important. 7s6s is not a premium hand. I think folding is reasonable. But we could also consider raising to steal? Actually we are in BB, can't raise to steal because SB already posted 2, we could raise to 8 (minimum). That would be a raise of 4 more (total 8). That could be a steal attempt. With 7s6s, not a good raise. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n"

This is a fold in almost all situations.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the button which is good, but with such a weak hand it doesn't matter much.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:**\n   - SB is super short stacked (6 chips). They'll likely be all-in on the flop regardless. \n   - BB is extremely tight, folding most hands preflop.\n   \n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1 pot odds). This is not relevant with such a weak hand.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** \n   - I have a healthy stack (85.5 BB)\n   - The SB has only 1.5 BB left and will be forced all-in soon anyway\n   - There's no need to risk chips with such a weak hand\n   - Even if I call and the tight BB folds, I'm just gambling against the short stack\n   - If I call and BB raises, I'd have to fold anyway\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. 3-4 offsuit has very little equity even against random hands. With my healthy stack, I should wait for a better spot. The short stack in SB will likely bust soon anyway, and there's no need to donate chips with garbage.\n\nIf I were to call, I'd be putting in 4 chips (1% of my stack) to potentially win 10 chips, but with a hand that will hit a strong hand only rarely. It's not worth it.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Qh 5d is a weak hand, especially offsuit with a 5 kicker. This is not a premium hand by any means.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (big blind) facing a raise from the SB (seat 2). I'll be out of position postflop.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at seat 2's actions:\n   - Hand 30: raised to 24 preflop\n   - Hand 31: folded preflop  \n   - Hand 32: called 29 preflop, then bet 45 on flop and folded\n   - Hand 33: raised to 12, then 3-bet to 120 preflop, checked flop, folded turn\n   - Hand 34: folded preflop\n   \n   This opponent seems somewhat aggressive but not wildly so. They've shown some willingness to raise and 3-bet preflop.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - My stack: 225 chips (56.2 BB)\n   - Opponent (seat 2): Stack size isn't shown but they posted SB 2 and raised 8 total, so they have at least 8 chips\n   - Pot: 12 chips currently (2 SB + 4 BB + 8 raise - but wait, seat 2 already posted SB 2, so they raised 8 more to total 10? Actually: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, SB raises to 8 total, so additional 6? Let me recalculate: SB already had 2 in, raises to 8 total, so additional 6. Pot = 2 (SB) + 4 (BB) + 6 (additional raise) = 12 chips. Amount to call is 4 more (since I already have 4 in as BB).\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 to win 12, so pot odds are 3:1 or 25%. With Q5o, I need to consider if I have at least 25% equity against opponent's range.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 56.2 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands.\n\n7. **My recent history**: I've been folding a lot (win rate 11.8%, folded 30 of 34 hands). Might be playing too tight.\n\nHowever, Q5o is just too weak to defend from the BB against a raise, even with good pot odds. The problem is:\n- Poor hand strength\n- Out of position\n- Weak kicker\n- No connectivity or suitedness\n\nEven with 3:1 pot odds, I'm likely dominated by many hands in opponent's raising range. If they have any Q, they likely have a better kicker. If they have any pair, I'm behind. Only real value is if I hit two pair or trips.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. This is a standard fold with Q5o from BB facing a raise.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q5o is too weak to defend from BB against a raise.

This is essentially garbage that should be folded almost always from early position.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**: \n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been active with raises and calls, showing they can be aggressive\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has been very tight, folding in 9 out of 10 recent hands\n\n**Stack Position**: With 345 chips (86.2 BB), I'm in a healthy position and should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n**Tournament Strategy**: Playing weak hands from UTG position is a fundamental mistake that can quickly deplete my chip stack. I should wait for much stronger hands to open with from this position.\n\nThe pot odds (1.5:1) aren't sufficient to justify playing such a weak hand, especially when I'm likely to face aggression from at least one opponent who has shown willingness to raise.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9h 4c is too weak to play from UTG position. I'm in a healthy chip position and should wait for a much better hand to open with from early position.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have 9h 4c, which is a very weak hand, especially from UTG position. This is essentially a garbage hand that should be folded almost always.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) is the earliest position after the blinds, meaning I'm first to act preflop. This makes it even more important to have a strong hand.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 345 chips (86.2 BB), which is a healthy stack. I'm not short-stacked or desperate.\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis**:\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Looking at their recent actions, they've been quite active with raises and calls, but also folding frequently. They seem to be a thinking player who can be aggressive but also folds when necessary.\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): They've been very passive, folding in almost every hand I've seen (9 out of 10 recent hands were folds). This suggests they're either very tight or waiting for premium hands.\n\n5. **My Recent Performance**: Looking at my last 5 hands, I have a 26.5% win rate and have been folding frequently (23 out of 34 hands). My last hand was 2h Jh from BTN position which I folded.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 4 chips to see the flop. The pot is 6 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 pot odds. However, with 9h 4c, I'm likely behind even if someone calls.\n\n7. **Tournament Considerations**: I'm in a healthy chip position and should be preserving my stack for better opportunities.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. 9h 4c from UTG is way too weak to play, even against what appears to be a tight player (Seat 3) and a somewhat active player (Seat 2). I should wait for a much better hand to open with from this position.\n",

With 113 BB, I can wait for better spots rather than playing a dominated hand out of position postflop against a strong range.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: K9 offsuit (9h Kc)\n**Position**: Button (best position)\n**Stack**: 226 chips (113 BB) - healthy stack\n**Action**: MiniMax-M2 raised to 4 chips from MP (Seat 4)\n**Amount to call**: 4 chips\n**Pot odds**: 7 (current pot) + 4 (from raiser) = 11 chips, need to call 4 = 2.75:1\n\nLet me recall MiniMax-M2's tendencies:\nFrom the data, MiniMax-M2 has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in hands 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 (6 out of 7 hands)\n- Raised to 4 in hand 6 (which seems to be their standard raise size)\n- In hand 6, they showed aggression postflop with bets on flop and turn\n\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 is a tight-aggressive player who raises with strong hands. Their raise from MP likely indicates a strong range (AJ+, KQ+, 88+).\n\n**Hand analysis**:\n- K9o is a marginal hand, especially when facing a raise\n- It's dominated by many hands in a tight player's raising range (AK, KQ, KJ)\n- We have position, which helps\n- 113 BB deep, so we have room to play postflop\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: K9o is weak against a tight raiser's range\n2. **Position**: Button is good, we can act last postflop\n3. **Opponent**: Tight player raising from MP = strong range\n4. **Stack depth**: Deep enough to play speculative hands, but K9o doesn't have great implied odds\n5. **Tournament**: Early stage, no pressure yet\n\nI think calling is marginal at best. K9o is likely dominated too often. Folding is reasonable. \n\nHowever, since we're on the button with a deep stack, and facing a min-raise (2x BB), we could consider calling to see a flop in position. But given how tight MiniMax-M2 is, I'm more inclined to fold this dominated hand.\n\nLet me reconsider - the raise is only to 4 (2x BB), so it's a min-raise. We're getting 2.75:1 pot odds. With position and depth, calling might be okay, but it's still marginal.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes, this is still early tournament. I think the best play is to **fold**. K9o is just too weak against a tight player's raising range, and we don't want to get dominated.\n\nWait, let me think again. We're on the BUTTON. Position is huge. The raise is small (2x). We have a deep stack. K9o can hit some good flops (Kxx, 9x, straight draws). Maybe calling is okay?\n\nBut fundamentally, K9o is a trash hand against a tight raiser. When we hit a K, we're often dominated. When we hit a 9, it's not great. The straight potential is limited.\n\nI think the correct play is to **fold**. We can find better spots against this tight player.",

Better to preserve stack and wait for better spots with positional advantage.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Now I have a good picture of the situation:\n\n1. My hand: Tc 4h - This is a very weak hand, especially offsuit with no connectivity. Ten-high with a weak kicker.\n\n2. Position: I'm on the BTN (button), which is a great position, but the hand is terrible.\n\n3. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) raised to 4 chips. Looking at their history, they've raised once before (hand #6) with Qs Ks, which is a premium hand. They've mostly been folding preflop (7 folds out of 10 hands), calling twice, and raising once. They seem relatively tight.\n\n4. My stack: 195 chips (97.5 BB) - healthy stack.\n5. Pot: Currently 7 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 4 raise)\n6. Amount to call: 2 chips (since I already posted BB of 2)\n7. Pot odds: I need to call 2 to win 7, so pot odds are 2:7 or 28.6%. My hand needs ~29% equity to justify a call.\n\n8. Tournament considerations: I have a decent stack, no need to take unnecessary risks with such a weak hand.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Tc 4h has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a wide range, it's likely below 30% equity.\n- Being on the button gives me positional advantage postflop, but with such a weak hand, I'll often miss the flop and have to fold.\n- MiniMax-M2 has shown to be tight (7 folds, 2 calls, 1 raise in 10 hands). Their raise likely indicates a decent hand.\n- The raise size is small (min-raise to 4, which is 2BB total), which could indicate either weakness or trapping with a strong hand.\n\nGiven that I need ~29% equity and Tc 4h likely has less than that against a tight opponent's raising range, this is an easy fold. Even if I call, I'll be out of position postflop (actually wait, I'm on the button, so I'll have position on the raiser who is in the SB? Let me check: Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, who is in the SB position? Actually looking at the players: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded, I'm Seat 3 (BTN), Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, Seat 5 folded. So MiniMax-M2 is in the CO position? Wait, the positions: Seat 1 is UTG, Seat 2 is SB, I'm Seat 3 (BTN), Seat 4 is BB, Seat 5 is UTG? Actually with 5 players: Seat 1 would be UTG, Seat 2 SB, Seat 3 BB, Seat 4 BTN, Seat 5 CO? But the hand says: \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\" and \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2\" raised. So MiniMax-M2 is in the CO position (cutoff) and raised, and I'm on the BTN. So I would have position on them postflop.\n\nEven with position, the hand is too weak. Better to fold and wait for a better spot. My tournament stack is healthy, no need to defend with such trash.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

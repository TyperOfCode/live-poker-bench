Looking at their history, they seem tight-aggressive. They've folded preflop several times, raised to 6 a couple times, and defended their blind once (hand 20). They called a flop bet and river bet in hand 20, showing they can defend.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - 205 chips. Very tight! They've folded preflop 4 out of 5 recent hands, only calling once. When they called, they checked down to showdown with A3.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN, which is great position postflop.\n\n**Hand Strength:** Qd Td is a good suited connector hand, especially on the button. It has good postflop playability and can make strong hands.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Position advantage:** BTN is the best position\n2. **Hand playability:** QTs suited is a solid raising hand from BTN\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** SB is moderately aggressive, BB is very tight\n4. **Stack sizes:** I have a healthy stack, can afford to play this hand\n5. **Pot odds:** Need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1), which is marginal but position makes up for it\n\nGiven I'm on the BTN with a playable suited hand, and the BB is very tight (folding 80% of the time), I should raise to:\n- Steal the blinds\n- Build the pot when I have position\n- Put pressure on the tight BB\n\nA standard raise would be 3x the BB = 12 chips. This is a good steal size and gives me control postflop.\n\nLet me raise to 12.",

Could be:\n- An Ace (top pair)\n- A Jack (second pair)\n- A flush draw\n- Or a complete bluff\n\n**My situation**:\n- I have a gutshot + backdoor flush draw\n- I have position (acting last)\n- I have a healthy stack (256 chips)\n- If I call 24, I'll have 232 left (58 BB)\n\n\n- Opponent has 100 chips remaining, which is quite short\n\nI realize my pot odds are terrible. The 2.17:1 pot odds mean I need 31.6% equity, but my actual equity is much lower at 8-12%. While I have some potential with my gutshot and backdoor flush, the risk of losing another bet on the turn makes this a clear fold. Despite having position, the opponent's likely strong hand and my limited outs make continuing unwise. I should preserve my chips for better opportunities.",

            "content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with Jh8h. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 12 (3x BB) from UTG, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called from SB. I need to call 8 chips into a pot of 28 chips (my 4 BB already in plus 12 from UTG plus 12 from SB). That's pot odds of 8 to 28, or 1:3.5, meaning I need about 22% equity to call.\n\nMy hand: Jh8h suited. This is a speculative hand that needs help postflop. Against an UTG raise and a SB call, my equity is likely marginal. From the opponent data:\n\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has shown some aggression (bet on flop and river in hand 20), but I don't see preflop raises in the limited data. Called twice from SB in previous hands.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has raised preflop twice (hands 17 and 20) from what appears to be SB/BB positions. Called a raise here.\n\nMy position is worst (BB) and I'll be out of position postflop against both players. My stack is 205 chips (51 BB), which is healthy but not huge.\n\nThe pot is 28, I need to call 8. If I call, pot becomes 36. Implied odds: if I hit a flush draw or straight draw, I could potentially win more. But being out of position makes it harder to realize equity.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack but not dominant. Folding preserves my stack. Calling with a marginal hand out of position could lead to difficult decisions postflop.\n\nGiven the UTG raise (usually indicates strength) and a caller, plus my poor position, I should probably fold. Jh8h suited isn't strong enough to defend against an UTG raise multi-way.\n\nHowever, let me check if there are any patterns: Seat 1 hasn't shown preflop raises in my limited data, but that could mean this is a stronger range. Seat 2 called, which could mean medium strength.\n\nActually, wait: I should consider that I'm getting 3.5:1 odds. With suited connectors, I need about 20-25% equity. Against a reasonable UTG range and a caller, Jh8s probably has around 25-30% equity. But being out of position reduces my ability to realize that equity.\n\nI think folding is correct here. Better to wait for a better spot with position.\n\nBut let me think about raising: I could raise to isolate or take down the pot now. Minimum raise to 20. That would be 16 more chips (20 total). Pot would be 44 (28 + 16). But I'd be risking 20 chips with a marginal hand against two players who have shown some interest. If I get called or re-raised, I'm in trouble.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: Seat 2 has only 148 chips (37 BB) after posting SB and calling. Seat 1 has 256 chips (64 BB). My 205 is in between.\n\nGiven all factors, I think folding is the most prudent. I'll preserve my stack for better opportunities."

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with Jh8h. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 12 (3x BB) from UTG, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called from SB. I need to call 8 chips into a pot of 28 chips (my 4 BB already in plus 12 from UTG plus 12 from SB). That's pot odds of 8 to 28, or 1:3.5, meaning I need about 22% equity to call.\n\nMy hand: Jh8h suited. This is a speculative hand that needs help postflop. Against an UTG raise and a SB call, my equity is likely marginal. From the opponent data:\n\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has shown some aggression (bet on flop and river in hand 20), but I don't see preflop raises in the limited data. Called twice from SB in previous hands.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has raised preflop twice (hands 17 and 20) from what appears to be SB/BB positions. Called a raise here.\n\nMy position is worst (BB) and I'll be out of position postflop against both players. My stack is 205 chips (51 BB), which is healthy but not huge.\n\nThe pot is 28, I need to call 8. If I call, pot becomes 36. Implied odds: if I hit a flush draw or straight draw, I could potentially win more. But being out of position makes it harder to realize equity.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack but not dominant. Folding preserves my stack. Calling with a marginal hand out of position could lead to difficult decisions postflop.\n\nGiven the UTG raise (usually indicates strength) and a caller, plus my poor position, I should probably fold. Jh8h suited isn't strong enough to defend against an UTG raise multi-way.\n\nHowever, let me check if there are any patterns: Seat 1 hasn't shown preflop raises in my limited data, but that could mean this is a stronger range. Seat 2 called, which could mean medium strength.\n\nActually, wait: I should consider that I'm getting 3.5:1 odds. With suited connectors, I need about 20-25% equity. Against a reasonable UTG range and a caller, Jh8s probably has around 25-30% equity. But being out of position reduces my ability to realize that equity.\n\nI think folding is correct here. Better to wait for a better spot with position.\n\nBut let me think about raising: I could raise to isolate or take down the pot now. Minimum raise to 20. That would be 16 more chips (20 total). Pot would be 44 (28 + 16). But I'd be risking 20 chips with a marginal hand against two players who have shown some interest. If I get called or re-raised, I'm in trouble.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: Seat 2 has only 148 chips (37 BB) after posting SB and calling. Seat 1 has 256 chips (64 BB). My 205 is in between.\n\nGiven all factors, I think folding is the most prudent. I'll preserve my stack for better opportunities.",

Better to preserve stack for better spots with position. Fold and wait for stronger hand.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Now I have more information. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop before - to 6 in hand 5 and 8 in hand 12. Their showdown hands were 98s and 98o - medium suited connectors. So their raising range might include speculative hands. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop multiple times, including with AKs in hand 20. They called here from SB.\n\nGiven Seat 1's raising range might include hands like 98s, my Jh8h is actually similar but slightly better (higher cards, suited). I'm getting 3.5:1 odds. Against two players, Jh8s has decent equity if we hit a flush or straight. But being out of position is a big disadvantage.\n\nHowever, the pot odds are good. If I call 8 into 28, that's 22% equity needed. Against two opponents with reasonable ranges, Jh8s probably has 25-30% equity. The problem is realizing that equity out of position.\n\nI could consider raising to 20 to try to take it down now. But Seat 1 has 256 chips and might call or re-raise. Seat 2 has 148 and might fold or call.\n\nActually, looking at Seat 1's previous raises: 6 and 8. Here they raised to 12 (3x). That's larger than before. Could indicate strength. Seat 2 called, which might indicate medium strength.\n\nI think folding is still reasonable. But let me check if there are any other factors. My stack is 205, blinds are 2/4. I have plenty of chips. No need to gamble with marginal hand out of position.\n\nI'll fold.",

The risk of being raised by players behind me makes this an easy fold.\n\n**Decision: Fold**\n\nI'm waiting for a much stronger hand to open with from this early position, especially given my decent stack size and the tournament setting where I can afford to be patient.",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation based on the information I have:\n\n**Current Hand Analysis:**\n- UTG position with 9h 6c - extremely weak hand\n- Need to call 4 chips to see the flop\n- 4 players still to act behind me\n- Stack is healthy at 322 chips (80.5 BB)\n\n**From my hand history:**\n- I've played 20 hands total, won 5, folded 14 times (70% fold rate)\n- In UTG position specifically, I've seen some weak hands like 52o and folded them\n- When I do play UTG, I tend to raise with strong hands (KK, AA)\n- I won a big pot recently with KK by being aggressive\n\n**From opponent actions:**\n- Recent actions show some limping and raising activity\n- Kimi-K2 players seem active (one called, one raised)\n- GPT-OSS-120B appears to be short-stacked (41 chips)\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 96o is terrible UTG - should fold 90%+ of the time\n2. **Position pressure**: UTG with 4 players behind means high chance of being raised\n3. **Stack preservation**: At 80+ BB, I can wait for better spots\n4. **Pot odds**: While 4 chips to call isn't much, the implied odds aren't worth it with this hand\n5. **Tournament strategy**: Early in tournament, need to avoid marginal spots\n\nThis is clearly a fold. 96o from UTG is one of the worst positions to play this hand from. Even though the call is only 4 chips, the risk-reward doesn't justify it when there are so many better hands I could play from this position.\n\nThe minimum raise to 8 chips would be even worse - that would be playing a terrible hand aggressively from the worst position.\n",

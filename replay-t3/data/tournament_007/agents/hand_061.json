A standard raise would be 3x BB = 48 chips, but since I'm on the button with a premium hand against a short stack, I could go slightly bigger to 64 chips (4x BB) to really put pressure on them and potentially take down the pot preflop or set up a post-flop scenario where they have a tough decision with their short stack.\n\nLet me raise to 64 chips which is 4x the big blind - a solid standard raise that puts pressure on the short stack while still giving me flexibility post-flop.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n1. My hand: 9d 4h - This is a very weak hand, essentially garbage. Even though I have suited cards, 9-4 suited is still a very poor hand that rarely makes strong combinations.\n\n2. My position: I'm in the Big Blind (BB), which means I get to see the flop for \"free\" if no one raises, but here there's a raise.\n\n3. Stack situation: I have 98 chips (6.1 BB), which is quite short-stacked. This makes me need to be very selective about which hands I play.\n\n4. Opponent: Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised to 64 chips preflop. Looking at my memory, this opponent seems to be quite aggressive preflop - they've raised 5 out of the last 10 hands I can see, which is a high frequency.\n\n5. Amount to call: 48 chips (since I already posted 16 as BB, I need to call 48 more to stay in the hand).\n\n6. Minimum raise would be to 112 chips total.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have a very weak hand (9-4 suited)\n- I'm short-stacked at 6.1 BB\n- The opponent is quite aggressive\n- I would need to call 48 chips to see a flop\n\nThis is a clear fold. With 9-4 suited, I have virtually no chance of winning unless I hit a very specific straight or flush, and even then it would be weak. The pot odds don't justify calling 48 chips with this hand when I'm short-stacked and facing an aggressive opponent.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

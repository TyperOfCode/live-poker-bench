This is definitely a raising hand.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in BB, which is out of position postflop, which is a slight disadvantage but manageable.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nThere's 10 chips in the pot (2 from SB + 4 from BB + 4 from limper). Since it's checked to me, I can check and see a free flop, or I can raise to take control.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. KQ is too strong to just check here\n2. The opponent is very tight/passive - likely has a weak/marginal hand\n3. I have position disadvantage, so I want to take control now\n4. Raising will likely fold out their weak hands and build the pot when I likely have the best hand\n5. Minimum raise is to 8 chips (4 more chips)\n\nI should raise here. A standard raise would be 3-4x the limp, so 12-16 chips total. Since minimum is 8, I should raise to at least 12 to get value and apply pressure.\n\nLet me raise to 12 chips (3x the limp).",

I have K-Q on a J-T-2 board, so any Ace or 9 gives me a straight.\n- 8 outs to the straight (4 Aces + 4 Nines)\n- This is about 16% equity on the turn (8/47), or about 31% by the river\n- I also have a backdoor flush draw with Qh (need running hearts)\n\n**Opponent tendencies from the data:**\nSeat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has been very passive:\n- They fold preflop a lot (hands 32-37)\n- When they do play, they check-call a lot (hand 38, 39)\n- They called a turn bet in hand 39\n- In hand 38 they had K-7 and checked down on A-J-5-6-8 board (missed straight draw?)\n- In hand 39 they had 6-4 and hit two pair on 9-3-4-2-6 board\n\nThis opponent seems passive, calling station tendencies. They call preflop, then check-call down.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 26, I can check for free. If I bet, minimum raise is 8.\n\n**Decision:**\nI have a strong draw with 8 outs to the nuts (straight). I should bet for value and to build the pot when I hit. I can also get folds from weaker hands.\n\nGiven the opponent's passive tendencies, they're likely to call with any pair or draw. I should bet to:\n1. Build the pot for when I hit my straight\n2. Charge them for draws\n3. Potentially get value from weaker hands like Jx or Tx\n\nA bet of around 1/2 to 2/3 pot (13-18 chips) seems appropriate. Given the minimum raise is 8, I could bet 16-20.\n\nLet me bet 16 (about 2/3 pot) to charge draws and build the pot.",

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 2, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB 4. It's folded to me on the button.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression (raised to 40 in hand 33, raised to 8 in hand 34). Shows 9-8 suited/offsuit holdings in showdowns. Has folded the last few hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Seems to play fairly passively - calls and checks often. Showed 66, A5s, JQo, 43s, K6o in showdowns.\n\nMy position on the button is excellent. With pocket 7s, this is a medium pocket pair that plays well in position. I have 59 BB stack, which is healthy but not huge.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Pocket 7s is a hand that wants to see a flop cheaply and try to hit a set (about 12% chance). If I don't hit a set, it's often easy to fold.\n2. Being on the button gives me positional advantage postflop.\n3. The SB (seat 4) seems passive and may just complete if I call.\n4. The BB (seat 1) has shown aggression but has folded several recent hands.\n\nOptions:\n- Fold: Too conservative with a medium pocket pair on the button\n- Call: Standard play - see a flop cheaply, try to hit a set\n- Raise: Could be good to take initiative, but pocket 7s doesn't play great as a raise if called\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies and my position, calling seems optimal. I get to see a flop for cheap with good implied odds if I hit a set. Raising might fold out the blinds, but if called, I'm OOP against at least one player (SB would act before me postflop since he's in the blinds). Actually wait, I'm on the button, so I'd have position on everyone postflop. But still, pocket 7s doesn't want to build a big pot preflop without hitting a set.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips, I need to call 4. That's good pot odds (2:1). With implied odds if I hit a set, calling is good.\n\nI should call."

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm on the button with pocket 7s. My stack is 237 chips (59.2 BB). The blinds are 2/4. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 2, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB 4. It's folded to me on the button.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression (raised to 40 in hand 33, raised to 8 in hand 34). Shows 9-8 suited/offsuit holdings in showdowns. Has folded the last few hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Seems to play fairly passively - calls and checks often. Showed 66, A5s, JQo, 43s, K6o in showdowns.\n\nMy position on the button is excellent. With pocket 7s, this is a medium pocket pair that plays well in position. I have 59 BB stack, which is healthy but not huge.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Pocket 7s is a hand that wants to see a flop cheaply and try to hit a set (about 12% chance). If I don't hit a set, it's often easy to fold.\n2. Being on the button gives me positional advantage postflop.\n3. The SB (seat 4) seems passive and may just complete if I call.\n4. The BB (seat 1) has shown aggression but has folded several recent hands.\n\nOptions:\n- Fold: Too conservative with a medium pocket pair on the button\n- Call: Standard play - see a flop cheaply, try to hit a set\n- Raise: Could be good to take initiative, but pocket 7s doesn't play great as a raise if called\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies and my position, calling seems optimal. I get to see a flop for cheap with good implied odds if I hit a set. Raising might fold out the blinds, but if called, I'm OOP against at least one player (SB would act before me postflop since he's in the blinds). Actually wait, I'm on the button, so I'd have position on everyone postflop. But still, pocket 7s doesn't want to build a big pot preflop without hitting a set.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips, I need to call 4. That's good pot odds (2:1). With implied odds if I hit a set, calling is good.\n\nI should call.",

The pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + my call 4 + BB raise 8). I need to call 8 more.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising preflop quite often (7 times in the data I see). Their raises range from 6 to 40 chips. They've shown down hands like 9-8 suited, 9-8 offsuit - so they're playing somewhat loose. They raised to 12 in hand 21 and hand 31.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 7s is a medium pocket pair. It plays well in position (I'm on the button). Against a single opponent, this is a decent hand to continue with, especially in position.\n\nStack sizes: I have 233 chips (58 BB), opponent has 330 chips (82.5 BB). The raise is small relative to stacks.\n\nPosition: I have position advantage - I'm on the button, will act last postflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 18 (current pot) + 8 (my call) = 26. That's about 1:2.25 odds (31% equity needed). Pocket 7s vs a reasonable raising range has around 40-45% equity, so pot odds are favorable.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm not desperate for chips, but not huge either. Winning this pot would be nice.\n\nGiven the small raise size, my position advantage, and favorable pot odds, calling seems reasonable. Raising could also be considered to take initiative, but pocket 7s doesn't love facing a 3-bet, and the opponent might call with many hands that have good equity against us.\n\nLooking at my recent history: I've been folding a lot (33 folds out of 39 hands). I've won 2 small pots recently. Might be good to play a bit more aggressively.\n\nHowever, let me consider: If I call, the pot will be 26 chips. My stack is 225 after calling (233-8). That's still deep relative to the pot.\n\nI think calling is the standard play here. Folding would be too tight given the odds and position. Raising could be okay but might get us into trouble if opponent has a strong hand.\n\nLet's call."

I initially called the BB of 4, then the BB (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 12 total (8 more to call). The pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + my call 4 + BB raise 8). I need to call 8 more.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising preflop quite often (7 times in the data I see). Their raises range from 6 to 40 chips. They've shown down hands like 9-8 suited, 9-8 offsuit - so they're playing somewhat loose. They raised to 12 in hand 21 and hand 31.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 7s is a medium pocket pair. It plays well in position (I'm on the button). Against a single opponent, this is a decent hand to continue with, especially in position.\n\nStack sizes: I have 233 chips (58 BB), opponent has 330 chips (82.5 BB). The raise is small relative to stacks.\n\nPosition: I have position advantage - I'm on the button, will act last postflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 18 (current pot) + 8 (my call) = 26. That's about 1:2.25 odds (31% equity needed). Pocket 7s vs a reasonable raising range has around 40-45% equity, so pot odds are favorable.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm not desperate for chips, but not huge either. Winning this pot would be nice.\n\nGiven the small raise size, my position advantage, and favorable pot odds, calling seems reasonable. Raising could also be considered to take initiative, but pocket 7s doesn't love facing a 3-bet, and the opponent might call with many hands that have good equity against us.\n\nLooking at my recent history: I've been folding a lot (33 folds out of 39 hands). I've won 2 small pots recently. Might be good to play a bit more aggressively.\n\nHowever, let me consider: If I call, the pot will be 26 chips. My stack is 225 after calling (233-8). That's still deep relative to the pot.\n\nI think calling is the standard play here. Folding would be too tight given the odds and position. Raising could be okay but might get us into trouble if opponent has a strong hand.\n\nLet's call.",

The BB raised to 12 total, making it 8 more for me to call. Pot is 18 chips. I have position. The opponent seems to raise frequently. Pot odds: I need to call 8 to win 26 total (18+8), so I need about 31% equity. Pocket 7s has that against most ranges.\n\nGiven my position advantage and the small raise size, calling seems best. I could consider raising, but pocket 7s doesn't play well against a 3-bet, and I'd prefer to see a flop cheaply and potentially hit a set or play postflop with position.\n\nSo I'll call. My response should be:\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 7s has good equity against opponent's likely raising range.

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I have 7s7h on a Jc Ts 2c board. I'm on the button. The opponent (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised preflop from the BB to 12 total, I called. Now on the flop, opponent bets 16 into a pot of 42. I need to call 16 to win 58 (42+16). That's about 3.6:1 pot odds.\n\nMy hand: Middle pair with 7s. The board has Jc Ts 2c - two clubs, straight draws possible. My 7s are basically a bluff catcher here. The opponent could have a wide range: could be continuation betting with overcards, could have a jack, could have a draw, could have a ten, could have a bigger pair.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've been fairly active preflop with raises. On the flop, they've bet a few times (hand 12, 20) and raised once (hand 26). They seem to be aggressive.\n\nMy stack: 225 chips (56 BB) - decent but not huge. Opponent has 314 chips.\n\nGiven the board texture and my hand strength, I'm likely behind if opponent has any piece of this board. My 7s are vulnerable to overcards on turn/river. The flush draw and straight draws make this a dangerous board to continue with a marginal hand.\n\nHowever, I have position, which is valuable. The pot odds are decent (3.6:1). I need about 21% equity to call. Against a range of top pair, overpairs, draws, and some bluffs, I might have around 30-40% equity. But my hand has little improvement potential - only hitting a 7 (2 outs) or backdoor straight/flush possibilities.\n\nConsidering tournament implications: I have 56 BB, which is healthy. Folding here preserves my stack. Calling could lead to difficult decisions on future streets.\n\nLooking at opponent's flop betting: In hand 12 they bet 16 on flop (similar bet size). In hand 20 they bet 8 on flop (smaller). In hand 26 they raised on flop (aggressive).\n\nGiven the board texture (Jc Ts 2c) is quite coordinated with flush and straight draws, opponent might be betting with a wide range including draws. But my hand is weak and I'm out of position for the rest of the hand (actually I'm on button, so I have position - that's good).\n\nWait, I'm on the button, so I have position! That's actually a significant advantage. I can call and see a turn, then decide.\n\nBut my hand is really weak. Middle pair with bad kicker on a wet board. If I call, I'm likely calling again on turn if checked to, or facing another bet.\n\nI think the prudent play is to fold. The pot is small relative to my stack, and I'm likely behind or in a vulnerable spot. Better to wait for a better spot.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors: The opponent raised preflop from BB after I limped. Their range could be strong. They're now betting flop. This could be a standard continuation bet with a wide range, but my hand isn't strong enough to continue.\n\nI'll fold.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - great position\n- Cards: 6s 6h - pocket sixes, a medium pair\n- Stack: 304 chips (152 BB) - very healthy stack\n- Pot: 13 chips\n- Blinds: 1/2\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): posted 1\n- Seat 3 (BB): posted 2  \n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): raised to 4\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): raised to 6\n\nSo I need to call 6 to see the flop. The minimum raise would be to 8.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n\n**Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2):**\n- Recent preflop actions: fold, fold, raise(4), fold, fold, call(2), bet(2), call(8), fold, fold\n- Seems tight, raises occasionally to small amounts\n- Their raise to 4 here is a min-raise from UTG+1 position\n- They showed down Qs Ks previously (strong hand)\n\n**Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B):**\n- Recent preflop actions: fold, call(4), bet(8), check, fold, fold, call(2), check, check, fold\n- Also relatively tight, but more active than Seat 4\n- Their raise to 6 here is a small re-raise (3x the BB)\n- They showed down As 5h previously (ace-rag suited)\n\n**My Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket sixes is a medium pair. It's vulnerable to overcards but has good potential against 1-2 opponents. On the button, I have position advantage.\n\n2. **Action**: There's been a raise and a re-raise. This suggests at least one of them has a real hand. The raises are small (4 and 6), which could indicate:\n   - Strong hands trying to build a pot\n   - Medium strength hands probing\n   - Light 3-bets\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 6 to win 13. That's about 2.17:1 pot odds. This is marginal for pocket sixes in a multi-way pot with action.\n\n4. **Implied Odds**: If I hit a set (about 1 in 8.5 chance), I could win a big pot. With 304 chips, I have deep stacks relative to the bet.\n\n5. **Opponent Tendencies**: Both opponents seem relatively tight based on their histories. The small raise sizes might indicate they're not super strong, but I can't be certain.\n\n6. **Position**: Being on the button is excellent. I'll act last on all postflop streets.\n\n7. **Tournament Consideration**: My stack is healthy at 152 BB. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position.\n\n**Decision**: With pocket sixes on the button, facing two small raises, I think calling is the best play. Raising would be too aggressive with a medium pair facing action, and folding is too tight given my position, hand potential, and stack depth. I want to see the flop in position and evaluate.\n\nThe call is 6 chips which is only 2% of my stack - very manageable. If I hit a set, I can potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold to further aggression.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**Hand: 6s 6h** - Pocket sixes. A medium pair, good for set mining.\n\n**Position:** Button (BTN) - Excellent position, last to act postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 298 chips (149 BB) - Deep stack relative to blinds.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Pot is 47 chips\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 4, then re-raised to 8 after Seat 5's raise to 6\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6, then raised to 30\n- I called the initial raise to 6\n- Now I need to call 24 more (30 - 6 = 24) to see the flop\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):**\n- Shows a pattern of folding preflop frequently (folded in hands 9, 10, 12, 13, 15)\n- Only raised preflop in hand 11 (amount 4)\n- Called in hand 14, then bet flop, called turn, folded river\n- Showed down KQs in hand 6\n- Seems relatively tight/passive\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5):**\n- More active than Seat 4\n- Called in hands 13 and 15\n- Made a flop bet in hand 13 then folded on turn\n- Showed down A5s in hand 9\n- Seems capable of making moves\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 66 is a set-mining hand. I need to hit a set (about 12% chance on flop) to feel confident.\n2. **Pot odds:** Need to call 24 to win 47 = ~51% pot odds. This is not good for a set-mining hand that hits only 12% of the time.\n3. **Implied odds:** If I hit my set, I could win a big pot. Both opponents have shown they can put chips in.\n4. **Position:** Being on the button is great - I can control the action postflop.\n5. **Action:** There's been a 3-bet and 4-bet sequence. Seat 5's raise to 30 is significant (15 BB).\n6. **Stack preservation:** I have a healthy stack. Calling 24 chips would leave me with 274 chips, which is still good.\n\n**Decision:** This is a fold. The pot odds are terrible for set mining (need about 8:1 implied odds minimum, getting less than 2:1 immediate). While I have position, the 4-bet to 30 suggests real strength from Seat 5. With 66, I'm likely dominated by higher pairs or flipping against overcards. The risk isn't worth it.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I already invested 6 chips. The pot is 47, I need to call 24 more. That's about 2:1 pot odds. For set mining, I need much better implied odds. The 4-bet suggests strong hands. Even though I'm on the button, 66 doesn't play well against the range that 4-bets to 30. I should fold and preserve my chips for better spots.",

Jack-high with a weak kicker, offsuit. This is a trash hand in multi-way raised pot.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has raised preflop once before (hand #11). Mostly folds. Seems somewhat tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded or called. Only one showdown with A5o. Seems passive.\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has called in multiple spots. Shows down medium-strength hands like 98s, 98o.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 4 chips to win current pot of 19 chips. That's about 4.75:1 pot odds (21% equity needed). However, this is preflop with a very weak hand, and there are still players to act behind me (the SB already folded).\n\n**Position:** I'm in SB, worst position postflop. With Jh 3s, I'll be out of position against 3 opponents.\n\n**Stack Sizes:** I have 207 chips, which is healthy (103.5 BB). Seat 4 has 172, Seat 5 has 173, Seat 1 has 298.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I should preserve my stack. Getting involved with Jh 3s from SB in a multi-way raised pot is terrible.\n\n**Alternative Considerations:** Could I raise? Minimum raise to 8 total. But with Jh 3s, raising would be spewy. Could get re-raised by Seat 1 who already called.\n\n**Decision:** This is an easy fold. Jh 3s is not playable from SB facing a raise and re-raise with a caller. Even with good pot odds, the hand is too weak and position is terrible. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nI'll fold."

Jack-high with a weak kicker, offsuit. This is a trash hand in multi-way raised pot.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has raised preflop once before (hand #11). Mostly folds. Seems somewhat tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded or called. Only one showdown with A5o. Seems passive.\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has called in multiple spots. Shows down medium-strength hands like 98s, 98o.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 4 chips to win current pot of 19 chips. That's about 4.75:1 pot odds (21% equity needed). However, this is preflop with a very weak hand, and there are still players to act behind me (the SB already folded).\n\n**Position:** I'm in SB, worst position postflop. With Jh 3s, I'll be out of position against 3 opponents.\n\n**Stack Sizes:** I have 207 chips, which is healthy (103.5 BB). Seat 4 has 172, Seat 5 has 173, Seat 1 has 298.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I should preserve my stack. Getting involved with Jh 3s from SB in a multi-way raised pot is terrible.\n\n**Alternative Considerations:** Could I raise? Minimum raise to 8 total. But with Jh 3s, raising would be spewy. Could get re-raised by Seat 1 who already called.\n\n**Decision:** This is an easy fold. Jh 3s is not playable from SB facing a raise and re-raise with a caller. Even with good pot odds, the hand is too weak and position is terrible. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nI'll fold.",

I need to act from SB. My options: fold, call, raise. Amount to call is 4 chips (from my BB of 2 to total of 6). Minimum raise to is 8 total.\n\nMy hand is terrible: Jh 3s offsuit. I'm out of position against multiple opponents. There's already a raise and a re-raise with a caller. This is a clear fold. Even with pot odds of 4 to win 19 (4.75:1), I need about 21% equity. Jh 3s has maybe 15-20% equity against ranges that include raises and re-raises. But position is horrible.\n\nI should fold.

However, with pocket Kings, I have a strong hand that can win against many holdings. The pot odds of 4.5:1 make this a mathematically sound call, even against a potential overpair.\n\nI'll call the 22 chips to see the flop and evaluate based on what comes.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me think through this decision carefully. I have pocket kings (Kh Kc) on a board of 7h Qs 3c Jd. This is a very strong hand - I have top pair with the best possible kicker. The board doesn't have any obvious threats like a flush draw or straight that would worry me.\n\nLooking at the pot situation:\n- Pot is 209 chips\n- I need to call 70 chips\n- This gives me pot odds of about 3:1 (209/70 = 2.99)\n- If I call, I'll have 41 chips left (111 - 70)\n\nMy opponent GPT-OSS-120B is short-stacked with only 44 chips and has bet 70 into the pot. This is a substantial bet relative to his stack size - he's essentially committed over half his stack.\n\nFrom the memory recall, I can see that GPT-OSS-120B has been generally passive throughout the tournament:\n- He folds most hands preflop\n- When he does play, he tends to bet on the flop but then check/fold on later streets\n- This suggests he doesn't have a lot of confidence in marginal hands\n\nHis betting pattern this hand:\n- He called preflop raises\n- Called my flop bet of 35\n- Now betting 70 on the turn\n\nThis turn bet could represent:\n1. A strong hand (maybe Qx, Jx, or even a set)\n2. A bluff trying to take down the pot\n3. A semi-bluff with a drawing hand\n\nGiven my hand strength (pocket kings, top pair), I should be ahead of most of his range. Even if he has a queen or jack, I have the best possible kicker.\n\nThe pot odds of 3:1 make this a clear call. I need to win about 25% of the time to break even, and with pocket kings on this board, I should be winning much more than that.\n\nIf I raise to 140, that would be essentially going all-in (I only have 111 chips total, so I'd be all-in). This might be too aggressive without more information about his hand.\n\nThe call is the optimal play here - it gives me a chance to win a substantial pot with a very strong hand while preserving some chips if I'm wrong. \n\nI'll proceed with calling the bet, staying alert to any new developments on the river.",

Since I have pocket kings which are likely the best hand, I should bet. But the legal actions only show 'fold' and 'check', not 'bet' or 'raise'.\n\nThis is confusing. If the legal actions are only fold and check, that means I cannot bet. Maybe there's some rule about minimum bet sizes or stack considerations that prevents me from betting?\n\nLet me think about this differently.

This might be why betting is not an option - I would need to go all-in but the system is presenting this as a check/fold spot.\n \nI'll stick with my original assessment. With pocket kings likely being the strongest hand, and facing a passive opponent, I should bet to extract value.

Actually both hearts: Ten hearts and Ace hearts: A\u2665 T\u2665, suited Ace Ten (ATs). Good hand, strong. Position CO (cutoff). Preflop: seat2 posted small blind 1, seat3 posted big blind 2, seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 4. So raise from 2BB to 4 (2x BB). We have 179 chips stack.\n\nWe need to decide: call 4 (total pot after call would be 4+4+1+2? Actually pot currently 7 chips includes blinds 1+2+? plus raise 4? Let's compute: before action: SB 1, BB 2, then seat4 raise to 4 (meaning total bet 4). So pot = 1+2+4 =7 (as given). To call we need to put 4 total (so add 2 more? Actually we haven't posted any chips yet; to call we must put 4 chips, matching raise. So call cost = 4. Minimum raise to 6 (meaning raise total to 6). So raise amount would be 6 total (i.e., add 2 more than call). So we can raise to 6, or more.\n\nGiven hand ATs, position CO, raise is strong. Opponent MiniMax-M2's tendencies: from recall: they have raised preflop 4 in hand 6 and 11 (two raises). In hand 6 they raised 4 (same amount) and later bet big on flop/turn. So they are capable of raising with some strength, perhaps a wide range? Hand 14 they called preflop 2 (so they called a raise? Actually hand 14 they called 2? That suggests they called a raise of 2? Not sure. But overall they sometimes raise, sometimes fold.\n\nGiven we have a premium hand, we could 3-bet. Stack is deep (89.5 BB). Raising to 6 is minimal; we could raise larger to isolate and build pot. Considering tournament stage? Not given. But we have decent stack.\n\nWhat about other players behind us? No one else yet (we are CO, then button? Actually seat5 is us, seat6 maybe? Not listed. So after us, seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is next (UTG?), but they are in early position? Actually seat1 is after seat5? Table seats: 1,2,3,4,5. So after seat5, seat1 is next (the dealer maybe?). So we act before seat1, seat2, seat3, seat4 already acted. So only seat1 left to act after us. So we could raise to isolate MiniMax-M2 or we could just call and let others act.\n\nGiven ATs is a strong hand but not top of range for 3-bet vs unknown raise. However in tournament, you may want to 3-bet for value and to build pot. Opponent's raise size is small (2BB). So 3-betting to 6 is 3x raise (or 3x BB). Could also raise to like 12-15 to apply pressure. But we must consider stack depth and possible re-raise. MiniMax-M2 may 4-bet all-in? Unlikely with 89 BB.\n\nI think best is to raise to 6 (minimum) to take initiative and thin the field, and if seat1 calls we have a multi-way pot but still okay. Could also raise to 12 to isolate. Considering our hand is suited Ace Ten, we like to see flop. But also we could just call and see flop cheap. However raising gives us chance to win bigger pot and also maybe steal blinds later. I think raise.\n\nThus action: raise to 6. Reasoning: strong hand, position, opponent's raise small, want to build pot, isolate.\n\nReturn JSON.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have AA with T kicker? Actually hand is Th Ah (Ace of hearts and Ten of hearts). That's strong.\n\nPosition: BB. Preflop actions: SB posted 1, BB posted 2 (we are BB). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 4 (so open raise to 4). Then we (Seat5) raised to 6 (so 3-bet to 6). Seat1 called 6. Seats 2,3 folded. Then Seat4 re-raised to 8 (so a 4-bet to 8). So now we face a 4-bet to 8, we have already put 6 in, need to call 2 more to match 8. Minimum raise to 10 (so raise to 10 total). Our stack 173, we can call.\n\nWe need decide: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand AA is premium. Facing 4-bet from MiniMax-M2. Likely they have strong range. Could be AA, KK, maybe QQ, AK. We have AA, so we are ahead of most. Should we just call (flat) or 4-bet raise? The raise to 10 would be a 5-bet (but min raise is 10 total). So raise to 10 is just 2 more chips beyond call (i.e., 4 more total). That's minimal raise. Could also go all-in but not needed.\n\nGiven stack depth 86.5 BB, tournament stage unknown but early. We want to get value. The opponent 4-bet size is small (8). Raising to 10 would be a tiny raise, might be seen as a \"donk\" but could extract more. But we could also just call and see flop, but AA is strong.\n\nWe need consider that we are out of position (still BB vs UTG? Actually seat4 is maybe MP? But we are BB, after flop we will be out of position vs them). So we may want to build pot.\n\nGiven they 4-bet small, could be a bluff or a light 4-bet. Raising to 10 (i.e., 5-bet) is small; perhaps better to call and then see flop. But we have AA, we could also re-raise to maybe 12-14 to get more value. However min raise is 10, but we can raise higher? The legal actions: raise (no limit specified). Minimum raise to: 10. So we can raise to any amount >=10 up to our stack. So we could raise to, say, 30 to extract value. But we must consider opponent's likely range; they may have strong hands, but still we can get value.\n\nGiven tournament, we have a deep stack, we can raise to maybe 30-40 to protect against draws.\n\nBut also we risk them folding better hands? Actually they are already 4-bet, likely strong, they may call a reasonable raise.\n\nI think best is to raise to around 30 (i.e., 5-bet) to get value and protect.\n\nCheck legal: we can raise to any amount up to stack. So raise to 30.\n\nLet's decide: raise to 30.\n\nReasoning: Premium AA, opponent 4-bet, want to build pot, extract value, protect against draws, maintain stack.\n\nThus output JSON.",

Pot odds: need 35 to win pot ~ (104+35*2?) Actually after call, pot will be 104 + 35 (bet) + 35 (call) = 174. So we need to invest 35 to win 174, odds = 35/174 = 20.1% needed. Our equity: With Ace Ten hearts vs unknown hand. Let's estimate: We have about 12 outs? Flush outs: need two more hearts: there are 13 hearts total, we have Ah, Th, board 7h, so remaining hearts = 10. Actually we have two hearts in hand, one on board, so 10 hearts left. Also straight draws? Not many. Overcards may pair. So approx 10 outs. 10 outs gives ~ 20% chance on turn (if one card left) and ~ 35% by river. Since two cards to come, equity maybe around 30%? So calling is profitable.\n\nAlso we have deep stack 149, can raise? Minimum raise to 70, raise would be 70 total, meaning raise additional 35. Might be good to raise as semi-bluff to put pressure. But we have only 35 to call; raising to 70 would be 35 more. Could we raise? Yes legal. Should we raise? Opponent might fold weaker hands, but also we could get called and we have equity.\n\nGiven we are out of position (BB vs opponent in seat4, who is likely in early position? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, preflop they raised, we 3-bet, they 4-bet? Wait preflop: seat4 raise 4, seat5 raise 6 (our 3-bet), seat1 call 6, seat4 raise 8 (4-bet to 8?), seat5 raise 30 (5-bet), seat4 call 22. So they called our 5-bet. So they are likely a strong hand preflop. They have likely a premium hand like AK, AQ, JJ, TT, maybe pocket pairs. Board Qs 7h 3c, they have Qx maybe. So they could have Qx, which is top pair. Our hand is Ace high, but we have nut flush draw and overcards. So a raise might be okay to protect against them calling with Qx.\n\nGiven they are likely strong, raising may fold out some weaker Q hands? Actually they already have Q? Might call. Raising might be too aggressive? But we have strong draw, can raise to 70 to make them pay more.\n\nConsider stack sizes: they have 111 chips (from table). So they have about 111. If we raise to 70, they would need to call 35 more (since they already bet 35). They could call 35 to see turn, leaving them with 76 chips left. They might fold if they think we have strong. Might be good.\n\nGiven pot odds and equity, a call is safe. Raising could be okay but risk they fold and we lose value? But we already have equity to call.\n\nThus I will call.\n\nReturn JSON.",

That's two pair, beats us? Actually two pair QJ vs our pair of Aces: Aces higher pair, we win. Two pair QJ is lower than pair of Aces? Actually ranking: Pair vs Two Pair: Two Pair beats a single Pair. So QJ is two pair, beats our one pair Aces. So we could be behind. Could they have a set of 7s? That would be three of a kind, beats us. Could they have a set of 3s? also beats us. Could they have a straight? Need K for straight, not yet. So we are likely ahead but not guaranteed.\n\nGiven they checked, maybe they are pot controlling with medium hand. We could check to see river. Or raise to protect and get value from worse hands like Qx, Jx, etc.\n\nWhat is pot odds? Pot currently maybe around 209, we have 114 stack left. If we raise to say 70 (minimum raise 35 to 35? Actually raise_to total 35? That's just a small raise). Could raise to 70 to charge draws.\n\nWe need to decide. Considering tournament, stack 57 BB, still decent. I think raising to 70 to protect and extract value is good. But also risk of being behind if opponent has set. However they would likely bet on turn if they have set. They checked, so likely not set. So raise.\n\nThus action: raise to 70 (total). Provide reasoning.\n\n",

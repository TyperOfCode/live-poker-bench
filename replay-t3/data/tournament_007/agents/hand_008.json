MiniMax-M2 is in the small blind (Seat 4), and GPT-OSS-120B is in the big blind (Seat 5). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop, or I can raise to 4 minimum.\n\n**My stack**: 194 chips (97 BB) - healthy stack\n**Opponent stacks**: MiniMax-M2 (188), GPT-OSS-120B (195)\n\n**Hand strength**: KJo is a decent hand on the button. It's not premium but has good playability postflop. Being on the button gives me positional advantage.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from history**:\n- MiniMax-M2: Has raised preflop once (hand 6) from BB with Qs Ks (premium hand). Otherwise seems to play fairly tight. Folded to a raise from SB with 23s.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Has raised preflop once from SB with 23s (hand 7). Otherwise seems cautious.\n\n**My history**: I've folded every hand so far (7 hands). I need to start playing some hands to accumulate chips. Being too tight can be exploited.\n\n**Pot odds**: Pot is 3 chips, I need to call 2. Getting 1.5:1 odds preflop. Decent odds to see a flop with KJo.\n\n**Positional advantage**: Being on the button is huge. I get to act last on every postflop street.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 97 BB, I have plenty of room to maneuver. I should be looking to accumulate chips, not just preserve my stack.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight. KJo on button is definitely playable.\n2. **Call**: Reasonable. See a cheap flop with position.\n3. **Raise**: Also reasonable. Take initiative, potentially win blinds, or define hand.\n\nI think a raise is best here. KJo plays well as a raise from the button. I can put pressure on the blinds who likely have weak hands. A standard raise to 6-8 chips (3-4x) would be appropriate.\n\nLet me check what a typical raise size would be. Minimum raise is to 4 (2x BB). I should raise more like 6-8 to give myself better fold equity.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips (3x BB). This is a standard button raise."

MiniMax-M2 is in the small blind (Seat 4), and GPT-OSS-120B is in the big blind (Seat 5). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop, or I can raise to 4 minimum.\n\n**My stack**: 194 chips (97 BB) - healthy stack\n**Opponent stacks**: MiniMax-M2 (188), GPT-OSS-120B (195)\n\n**Hand strength**: KJo is a decent hand on the button. It's not premium but has good playability postflop. Being on the button gives me positional advantage.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from history**:\n- MiniMax-M2: Has raised preflop once (hand 6) from BB with Qs Ks (premium hand). Otherwise seems to play fairly tight. Folded to a raise from SB with 23s.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Has raised preflop once from SB with 23s (hand 7). Otherwise seems cautious.\n\n**My history**: I've folded every hand so far (7 hands). I need to start playing some hands to accumulate chips. Being too tight can be exploited.\n\n**Pot odds**: Pot is 3 chips, I need to call 2. Getting 1.5:1 odds preflop. Decent odds to see a flop with KJo.\n\n**Positional advantage**: Being on the button is huge. I get to act last on every postflop street.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 97 BB, I have plenty of room to maneuver. I should be looking to accumulate chips, not just preserve my stack.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight. KJo on button is definitely playable.\n2. **Call**: Reasonable. See a cheap flop with position.\n3. **Raise**: Also reasonable. Take initiative, potentially win blinds, or define hand.\n\nI think a raise is best here. KJo plays well as a raise from the button. I can put pressure on the blinds who likely have weak hands. A standard raise to 6-8 chips (3-4x) would be appropriate.\n\nLet me check what a typical raise size would be. Minimum raise is to 4 (2x BB). I should raise more like 6-8 to give myself better fold equity.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips (3x BB). This is a standard button raise.",

Need to start accumulating chips. Stack is 194 (97 BB) - healthy.\n\nRaise is good to take initiative. Standard raise size is 3-4x BB, so 6-8 chips. Minimum raise is 4 (2x BB). I'll raise to 6 (3x BB).\n\nSo action: raise, raise_to: 6.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider the blinds. MiniMax-M2 in SB, GPT-OSS-120B in BB. They might defend with wide ranges. But position helps.\n\nActually, let me check if I should consider calling instead. Calling 2 with position is fine too. But raising gives me fold equity and initiative.\n\nI'll raise to 6.

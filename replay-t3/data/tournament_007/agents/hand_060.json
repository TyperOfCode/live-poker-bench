            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the data for MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):\n- They just called the small blind (completed) preflop\n- From hand history, they seem to play a wide range - they call raises, make small bets, and sometimes fold\n- In hand 57, they were very active with multiple streets of betting\n- They have 114 chips, which is about 14 BB - they're short-stacked\n\nI have Ks Ac in the BB - this is a premium hand (AK suited). \n\nCurrent situation:\n- MiniMax-M2 posted SB (4 chips) and then just called 4 more to complete\n- Pot is 16 chips\n- I can check (since they just completed) or raise\n- My stack is healthy at 788 chips (98.5 BB)\n\nWith AKs, I definitely want to raise here. MiniMax-M2 has shown they'll call raises and play postflop. I should make a standard raise. The minimum raise is to 16 total (which would be 8 more for them to call).\n\nGiven they're short-stacked at 14 BB, I could also consider a larger raise to put pressure on them. A standard raise size would be 3x the big blind = 24 chips total, or about 2.5x = 20 chips.\n\nLet me think about sizing:\n- Minimum raise to 16 (2x BB) - might invite calls from weaker hands\n- Raise to 20 (2.5x BB) - standard\n- Raise to 24 (3x BB) - also standard\n- Larger raise to put pressure on their short stack\n\nSince they're short-stacked and have shown they'll call raises, I should make a solid raise. I'll go with 24 (3x BB) which is a standard preflop raise size. This builds the pot with my premium hand and puts pressure on their short stack.",

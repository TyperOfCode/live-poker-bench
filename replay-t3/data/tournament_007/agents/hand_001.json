It's not strong but has some potential with a Q high.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Stack depth**: Deep stack (100 BB) gives me room to play.\n4. **Opponents**: Two opponents left - SB and BB. No reads yet since this is hand #1.\n5. **Pot odds**: 2 to win 3 (1.5:1), which is decent.\n\n**Standard play**: Q7o is typically a fold from most positions, but on the button with no reads and deep stacks, it's borderline. The button position gives me significant advantage postflop.\n\n**Decision**: I think calling is reasonable here. The hand has some potential, I'm in position, and I can see a flop cheaply.

This gives me some advantage.\n\n3. **Action**: \n   - I called the BB (2 chips)\n   - SB (Seat 2) raised to 8 chips\n   - BB folded\n   - It's back to me with 6 chips to call\n\n4. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is currently 12 (my 2 + SB 1 + BB 2 + SB raise 8 - but wait, let me recalculate)\n   - Actually: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, I called 2, then SB raised to 8 (which means they added 7 more)\n   - Current pot: 1 (SB) + 2 (BB) + 2 (my call) + 8 (SB raise) = 13 chips\n   - I need to call 6 chips to win a pot of 13\n   - Pot odds: 13:6 or about 2.17:1, which means I need ~46% equity\n\n5. **Stack sizes**: I have 198 chips (99 BB), so calling 6 chips is trivial for my stack.\n\n6. **Opponent**: No history on this opponent since it's the first hand.\n\n7. **Hand strength**: Q7o is not a strong hand. Against a typical raising range, I'm likely behind. However, I'm in position.\n\nLet me think about typical SB raising ranges. From the small blind, a raise could mean:\n- Strong hands (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK, AQ, AJ, KQ)\n- Some bluffs or positional raises\n\nAgainst a typical tight raising range (like 15% of hands), Q7o has about 30-35% equity.\n\nGiven:\n- I need ~46% equity based on pot odds\n- I likely have 30-35% equity against their range\n- I'm in position which adds some value\n- No history on opponent\n\nThe pot odds aren't good enough to call with Q7o. Even with position, this is a fold. I could consider raising as a bluff since I'm on the button, but that would be risky without any information on the opponent.

I'm in the BB with 198 chips (99 BB). I have to call 6 more to stay in the pot (total of 8 in pot including my BB).\n\nCurrent pot: 12 chips (SB 1 + BB 2 + seat 1 call 2 + seat 2 raise 8? Wait, seat 2 raised to 8 total, so they put in 7 more after their SB of 1, making total 8 from them. So pot is: SB 1 + BB 2 + seat 1 call 2 + seat 2 raise 8 = 13? Actually seat 2's raise includes their SB, so total from seat 2 is 8. So pot = 1 (SB) + 2 (BB) + 2 (seat 1 call) + 8 (seat 2 raise) = 13 chips. But I need to call 6 more (I already have 2 in as BB, need to add 6 to match seat 2's 8).\n\nPot odds: I need to call 6 to win 13 + my 6 = 19 total. So pot odds: 6/19 \u2248 31.6%. My hand T8o is weak, especially against a raise from SB. SB could be raising with a wide range since they're in SB and there was only one limper. But still, T8o doesn't play well multi-way.\n\nHowever, I have position (I'm BB, will act last postflop). Seat 1 just called the raise, so they didn't 3-bet, which suggests they don't have a premium hand.\n\nStack sizes: We're all deep (99 BB effective). This is early in a tournament.\n\nMy hand has some speculative value - can make straights, but not great. I'm getting about 3:1 pot odds (13:6). That's decent, but I need to consider implied odds if I hit a strong hand.\n\nBut T8o is really weak. Against a SB raise range, my equity is probably around 30-35% at best. The pot odds are borderline.\n\nGiven this is the first hand and I have no reads on opponents, and T8o is a weak hand, I should fold. Calling here with a weak hand out of position (actually I'm BB, will act first postflop? Wait, order: SB (seat 2) acted last preflop? Let's see: SB raised, I'm BB, seat 1 is UTG? Actually positions: seat 1 is UTG? Not sure. But I'm BB, so I'll act first on flop if SB checks? Actually postflop order: SB acts first, then BB, then others. So I'll act second on flop.\n\nStill, T8o is not worth playing for 6 chips (3 BB) when I have 99 BB stack. Better to preserve chips.\n\nFold seems correct. Let me check if there are any other considerations. Tournament early stage, no need to take marginal spots."

But I need to call 6 more (I already have 2 in as BB, need to add 6 to match seat 2's 8).\n\nPot odds: I need to call 6 to win 13 + my 6 = 19 total. So pot odds: 6/19 \u2248 31.6%. My hand T8o is weak, especially against a raise from SB. SB could be raising with a wide range since they're in SB and there was only one limper. But still, T8o doesn't play well multi-way.\n\nHowever, I have position (I'm BB, will act last postflop). Seat 1 just called the raise, so they didn't 3-bet, which suggests they don't have a premium hand.\n\nStack sizes: We're all deep (99 BB effective). This is early in a tournament.\n\nMy hand has some speculative value - can make straights, but not great. I'm getting about 3:1 pot odds (13:6). That's decent, but I need to consider implied odds if I hit a strong hand.\n\nBut T8o is really weak. Against a SB raise range, my equity is probably around 30-35% at best. The pot odds are borderline.\n\nGiven this is the first hand and I have no reads on opponents, and T8o is a weak hand, I should fold. Calling here with a weak hand out of position (actually I'm BB, will act first postflop? Wait, order: SB (seat 2) acted last preflop? Let's see: SB raised, I'm BB, seat 1 is UTG? Actually positions: seat 1 is UTG? Not sure. But I'm BB, so I'll act first on flop if SB checks? Actually postflop order: SB acts first, then BB, then others. So I'll act second on flop.\n\nStill, T8o is not worth playing for 6 chips (3 BB) when I have 99 BB stack. Better to preserve chips.\n\nFold seems correct. Let me check if there are any other considerations. Tournament early stage, no need to take marginal spots.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my hand, I have Qd 3d - a very weak hand from UTG position. This is definitely a fold in most situations.\n\nKey factors:\n1. Hand strength: Q3s is extremely weak, even suited. It's dominated by many hands and has very poor playability postflop.\n2. Position: UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act on every street and have no information about opponents' intentions.\n3. Stack size: I have 298 chips (149 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take risks.\n4. Opponent tendencies: From the recall, I can see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 has been aggressive (raised preflop in hand 16, made big bets)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been very aggressive (re-raised multiple times in hand 16)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 folded to a raise in hand 16\n   - Kimi-K2 folded to a raise in hand 16\n\nThis suggests there are aggressive players behind me who could easily raise if I limp in. Even calling the 2-chip big blind is dangerous because I could face a raise and have to fold, losing chips unnecessarily.\n\nThe only consideration is that I have a suited hand (diamonds), which gives me some slim potential for a flush. But the chances of hitting a flush are very low (about 6.5% on the flop), and even if I do hit, I could be dominated by higher diamonds.\n\nFrom UTG with a weak hand like Q3s against aggressive opponents, this is an easy fold. I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots.",

No need to gamble with marginal hands.\n\nTournament stage: Still early with deep stacks. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nThe opponent's raise size is small (3x BB), which could indicate a wider range, but K9o still doesn't play well postflop out of position.\n\nGiven all factors: fold is the best play.

It's not strong but has some potential with a Q high.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Stack depth**: Deep stack (100 BB) gives me room to play.\n4. **Opponents**: Two opponents left - SB and BB. No reads yet since this is hand #1.\n5. **Pot odds**: 2 to win 3 (1.5:1), which is decent.\n\n**Standard play**: Q7o is typically a fold from most positions, but on the button with no reads and deep stacks, it's borderline. The button position gives me significant advantage postflop.\n\n**Decision**: I think calling is reasonable here. The hand has some potential, I'm in position, and I can see a flop cheaply. Raising with Q7o would be too loose, and folding is also fine but a bit tight for the button.\n\nLet me call and see the flop.",

Against a typical raising range, I'm likely behind. However, I'm in position.\n\nLet me think about typical SB raising ranges. From the small blind, a raise could mean:\n- Strong hands (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK, AQ, AJ, KQ)\n- Some bluffs or positional raises\n\nAgainst a typical tight raising range (like 15% of hands), Q7o has about 30-35% equity.\n\nGiven:\n- I need ~46% equity based on pot odds\n- I likely have 30-35% equity against their range\n- I'm in position which adds some value\n- No history on opponent\n\nThe pot odds aren't good enough to call with Q7o. Even with position, this is a fold. I could consider raising as a bluff since I'm on the button, but that would be risky without any information on the opponent.

It's offsuit and disconnected. The gap between 6 and J is large, and they're offsuit. This is a fold in almost all situations from early position.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - you act first preflop and will be out of position postflop against everyone. You need a very strong range from this position.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 198 chips (99 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: Early in a tournament, I should be playing tight and preserving my stack. 6-J offsuit from UTG is definitely a fold.\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools for this decision - it's a clear fold based on fundamental poker strategy. This is a textbook fold situation.\n\nThe amount to call is 2 chips, which would be 1% of my stack. The pot odds are good, but the hand is so weak and my position is so bad that it doesn't matter. Even if I hit a J, I'll often be dominated by AJ, KJ, QJ. If I hit a 6, it's rarely good.\n\nDecision: FOLD",

There's no value in betting here - I have absolutely no equity in this hand. If I bet, I'm pure bluffing against a player who has shown they call flops and fold turns. But with no draw and no equity, it's better to just check and give up if they bet later, or maybe catch something on the turn (though very unlikely to help my 2-9).\n\nActually, let me reconsider - with 2-9 offsuit on an A-J-7 board, there are only 6 cards that could help me (the other three 2s and three 9s), and even if I hit one, I could still be crushed.

The opponent has shown weakness by checking flop and turn. They're a conservative player based on history. The Ace on board is scary, and I can represent having an Ace or better.\n\nGiven:\n1. My hand is worthless\n2. Opponent shows weakness (two checks)\n3. Opponent tends to fold on turns (folded turn in hand #3)\n4. Board has high cards that I can represent\n5. Pot is small so risk is low relative to my stack\n6. I have position\n\nA small bluff here seems profitable. The minimum raise is 2 chips (to 2 total), making the pot 6 chips. This gives me good odds - risking 2 to win 4 (2:1 odds), and if opponent folds 40%+ of the time, it's profitable.\n\nLet me make a small bluff bet.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - excellent position\n- Cards: 7s 7d - pocket sevens, a medium pocket pair\n- Stack: 199 chips (99.5 BB) - very healthy stack\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- To call: 1 chip (additional to my SB)\n- Can raise to minimum 4 chips\n\n**Opponent Information:**\nLooking at the recall data for Kimi-K2 in Seat 2 (the BB):\n- Hand 1: Preflop raise 8 (I was in SB that hand and folded)\n- Hand 2: Preflop raise 6, then folded on flop\n- Hand 3: Preflop fold\n- Hand 4: Preflop fold\n\nSo the BB has been somewhat active but has folded the last 2 hands. They seem to raise fairly often when they play (8 and 6 chips).\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket sevens is a strong hand preflop, especially in position. It flops a set about 12% of the time and is ahead of most non-paired hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button - the best position postflop. This allows me to control the pot size and get maximum value.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 99.5 BB, which is excellent. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendency**: BB has been raising preflop when they play, but they've also folded the last 2 hands. They might be getting tighter or just had weak hands.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 1 more chip to win a pot of 3 chips (2.5:1 odds). This is an easy call with pocket sevens.\n\n**Decision**: \n- Just calling is an option, but with pocket pairs, we want to either:\n  a) Raise to isolate and take control, or\n  b) Call to see a cheap flop and try to hit a set\n\nGiven I'm on the button with 99.5 BB, I should raise here. Pocket sevens plays well as a raising hand in position because:\n- I can fold to a 3-bet if necessary\n- I can take control of the hand postflop\n- I can build a pot when I'm likely ahead\n- I can represent strong hands on various board textures\n\nA standard raise would be 3-4x the BB, so 6-8 chips given the 2 chip BB. Since minimum is 4, I should raise to at least 6. Let me raise to 6 to keep it standard and see how the BB responds.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's pattern, they raised to 6 and 8 in previous hands. A raise to 6 keeps me consistent with their sizing and is a standard 3x raise (2 BB x 3 = 6).",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand Analysis:**\n- My hand: 9d 8d (suited connector)\n- Position: BTN (Button) - excellent position\n- Stack: 202 chips (101 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot: 7 chips\n- Action: Seat 4 raised from 2 to 4 (a min-raise)\n- I need to call 4 to see the flop\n\n**Hand Evaluation:**\n- 98s is a decent speculative hand, especially from the button\n- Suited connectors play well in position\n- I have good implied odds if I hit a strong draw or two pair+\n- From the button, I can play this hand profitably\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) made a min-raise to 4\n- This is a small raise (2x the BB)\n- Without history on this opponent, I should assume a standard raising range\n- The min-raise size suggests they want action, possibly with a strong but not premium hand, or could be trying to steal\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- I need to call 4 to win a pot of 11 (7 + 4)\n- Getting 11:4 or ~2.75:1 pot odds\n- This is sufficient for a speculative hand like 98s from the button\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm deep stacked (101 BB), so I can afford to see flops with speculative hands\n- Position is power in poker, and I have the button\n- Calling keeps the pot small and allows me to play post-flop with position\n\n**Decision:**\nI should call here. Folding is too tight with a suited connector on the button against a min-raise. Raising could be an option, but calling keeps the pot small and allows me to use my positional advantage post-flop. The hand has good playability and I have the chips to see the flop.\n\nThe call is 4 chips, which is only 2% of my stack - a very small investment for a hand with good potential.",

They seem to be a fairly aggressive player who continuation bets frequently. They also called preflop raises in hands 2 and 3.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- They raised preflop to 4 (small raise)\n- I called with my suited connector\n- They bet 8 on the flop (about 42% of pot)\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 19\n- To call: 8\n- Pot odds: 27:8 or about 3.4:1\n- This means I need about 23% equity to call\n\n**My equity estimation:**\n- I have middle pair + gutshot + backdoor flush\n- Against a typical range (Ax, pairs, etc.), I probably have around 25-30% equity\n- The pot odds justify a call\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm on the button, which is great position\n- I can see what they do on the turn before acting\n\n\nI'll carefully consider raising as a strategic option. Raising could pressure my opponent and potentially take control of the hand. With my draw and position, a raise might force them to make a difficult decision. However, I need to balance the risk of building a larger pot with a marginal hand against the potential of winning immediately or gaining more information about their hand strength.\n\nThe stack depth allows for strategic maneuvering, giving me flexibility in my approach. My draw provides some interesting possibilities, though the board texture presents challenges with potential stronger hands like top pair or better draws.\n\nCarefully weighing my options, calling seems most prudent. The pot odds are favorable, and I maintain position while limiting immediate risk. A raise could unnecessarily escalate the pot size without clear advantage. By calling, I preserve my strategic flexibility and can reassess based on the turn card and opponent's subsequent action.",

I have middle pair with a decent kicker, but the board has an Ace which is scary, and there are potential straight draws (though not completed yet).\n\n**Pot odds:** \n- Pot is 35 chips\n- I need to call 8 chips\n- Pot odds = 35:8 or about 4.4:1\n- This means I need ~18.5% equity to break even\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- Hand 1: Preflop fold\n- Hand 2: Called 4 preflop, bet 4 on flop\n- Hand 3: Called 1 preflop, bet 2 on flop, bet 2 on turn\n- Hand 4: Preflop fold\n- Hand 5: Preflop fold\n\nThis opponent seems to be a relatively straightforward player who:\n- Folds weak hands preflop\n- Makes small continuation bets when they have something\n- Their bet sizing has been on the smaller side (8 on flop, now 8 on turn)\n\n**Current action:**\n- They raised preflop to 4 (small raise)\n- Bet 8 on flop (half pot)\n- Bet 8 on turn (smaller relative to current pot of 27)\n\nThe small turn bet could mean:\n1. They're trying to control the pot with a marginal hand\n2. They have a strong hand and want me to call\n3. They're making a blocking bet with a draw\n\nGiven the board texture (Ace-high), and my marginal hand (pair of 8s), I should consider:\n- The Ace is very scary - many hands have an Ace\n- I have middle pair with decent kicker\n- The opponent's betting pattern suggests they might have something but not a monster\n\n\n- Pot odds are favorable but not overwhelming\n- My hand is vulnerable to many turn cards\n\nI realize the pot odds are actually quite good. With 35 chips to win and only 8 to call, I'm getting excellent value. The opponent's consistent small betting suggests they might be trying to protect a marginal hand. While an Ace is concerning, my pair of 8s could still be ahead of their range. The small bet size indicates potential weakness, making a call more attractive. However, I need to carefully consider the potential hands that could beat me and the risk of losing more chips on the river.\n\nThe key is to weigh the immediate pot odds against the potential future betting and my hand's strength. With multiple opponents already folding and the button position, I'll need to make a strategic decision that balances potential value against risk.",

They were betting for value on flop and turn, but now they're checking on the river. This could mean:\n1. They have a mediocre hand and are scared of the flush/straight possibilities\n2. They have a strong hand and are trying to induce a bluff\n3. They have air and gave up\n\nGiven that they raised preflop and bet both flop and turn, they likely have:\n- An Ace (could be A with good kicker)\n- A pocket pair\n- Maybe a flush draw that missed\n\nThe flush draw came in on the river (3 clubs on board: Ac, 4c, Jc). If they had a flush draw, they might have been betting it, and now they either made it or missed.\n\nMy pair of 8s is relatively weak given the board texture:\n- Anyone with any club has a flush\n- Anyone with AJ, A4 has two pair\n\n\n- Any pocket pair 9s or higher beats me\n\nI'm facing a decision with a marginal hand. The opponent's check suggests uncertainty, but my 8s are vulnerable. Checking seems the safest option to control the pot size and avoid potential traps. The board's texture and my weak pair make aggression risky. I'll exercise caution and see what MiniMax-M2 does next, potentially extracting more information about their hand strength.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The user is playing No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker in a tournament. I need to analyze the current situation and provide a decision.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Position: CO (Cutoff) - Seat 1\n- Hand: 9c Qc (Queen-Nine suited, clubs)\n- Stack: 225 chips (112.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 11 chips\n- Action: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8\n- Amount to call: 8\n- Minimum raise to: 14\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nLet me analyze this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Q9s is a marginal hand. It's suited which gives some flush potential, but it's not a premium hand. It plays better in position, and I'm in CO (good position).\n\n2. **Position**: CO is good position - I act after most players but still have the BTN to act after me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: I just searched for GPT-OSS-120B's actions. Let me review:\n   - Hand 2: preflop fold\n   - Hand 3: preflop check (must have been BB), flop call 2, turn fold\n   - Hand 4: preflop call 1 (likely BB), flop check, turn check, turn fold\n   - Hand 5: preflop fold\n   - Hand 6: preflop fold\n   \n   So GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively tight/passive. They haven't shown any aggressive preflop raises until now. This is their first preflop raise in the hands I can see. This suggests they likely have a strong hand.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 11. That's 8/19 = 42% pot odds. Q9s typically has around 45-50% equity against a random hand, but against a tight player's raising range, it's much worse - probably around 30-35% equity.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (112.5 BB). I don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving my stack and looking for better opportunities is wise.\n\n6. **Action analysis**: The raise comes from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) who is in the Hijack position (one seat before me). Given their tight profile, this raise likely indicates a strong hand (premium pairs, strong broadway hands, maybe some suited connectors).\n\nWith Q9s, I'm dominated by many hands in their range (AQ, KQ, QJ, etc.). The suitedness helps but not enough to justify a call against a tight player's first preflop raise.\n\nI should fold. The hand is too weak, the opponent is showing strength with their first preflop raise, and I can preserve my chips for a better spot.\n\nDecision: fold",

          "reasoning_content": "  Good, I have some information about GPT-OSS-120B's playing style:\n\n1. **Frequently folds preflop** - In 13 recorded actions, 6 were preflop folds\n2. **Generally passive** - Only 1 preflop raise in hand #7 (8 chips)\n3. **Can call small bets** - Called 1 chip in hand #4, called 2 on flop in hand #3\n4. **Often gives up on later streets** - Folded on turn in hands #3 and #4\n\nNow let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**My hand: 9s 8c** - This is a suited connector (though not suited in this case, 9s 8c are different suits). It's a decent speculative hand that can make straights and two pairs, but it's not particularly strong preflop.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. I get to act last on every street.\n\n**Stack**: 223 chips (111.5 BB) - Healthy stack\n\n**Current action**: \n- Blinds are 1/2\n- Pot is 4 chips\n- Everyone folded to SB (Seat 5) who just called 1 (completing the small blind)\n- I posted BB of 2\n- Amount to call is 0 (I can check)\n\n**Pot odds**: If I check, I see a flop for free with 4 chips in the pot.\n\n**Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B is in the SB and just called. Based on their history, this could mean:\n- They have a marginal hand they want to see cheaply\n- They have a decent hand but are playing passively\n- They're trying to trap (less likely given their passive nature)\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 9s 8c is marginal but playable, especially in position\n2. **Position**: Excellent (on the button)\n3. **Pot odds**: Great - I can see the flop for free\n4. **Stack preservation**: Checking risks nothing\n5. **Opponent tendency**: They're passive, so checking is unlikely to induce aggression\n\n**Options**:\n- **Check**: See the flop for free, evaluate from there. Zero risk.\n- **Raise**: Try to win the pot preflop. Minimum raise is to 4 (2 more chips). Given opponent's passivity, they might fold. But if they call, I'm out of position with a marginal hand.\n- **Fold**: Not an option since I can check for free.\n\nSince I can see the flop for free and I'm in position with a speculative hand, checking is the clear best option. There's no need to risk chips preflop with 9s 8c when I can evaluate the flop texture and act with full information.\n\nI should check and see the flop.",

The board shows two 4s, and I don't have a 4. I don't have any straight draws or flush draws. My hand is complete air.\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the opponent actions I retrieved:\n- Generally tight/passive player\n- Frequently folds preflop (hands 1, 2, 5, 6, 8)\n- When they do play, they tend to be passive (check/call in hand 3, check/fold in hand 4)\n- Made one preflop raise in hand 7 (8 chips)\n- In this hand: posted SB, called 1 preflop, checked flop, checked turn\n\nThis opponent appears to be playing very passively. They've checked both flop and turn, showing weakness.\n\n**Position and Pot:**\n- I'm on the button (best position)\n- Pot is very small (4 chips)\n- I can check for free\n\n**Decision:**\nI have complete air (9-high). While I could try to bluff this passive opponent, the risk/reward isn't great:\n- The pot is tiny (4 chips)\n- Bluffing would risk chips with 9-high\n- The opponent has shown passivity but could be trapping with a monster\n- With no equity, no draw, and a passive opponent, checking is the correct play\n- I should preserve my chips for better spots\n\nWhile the opponent has been passive, bluffing with 9-high into a dry board with two 4s isn't a good play. The opponent could easily have a King or Jack and be slow-playing, or they could have a 4. Checking costs nothing and I can see the river card for free.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 9s 8c (I have a pair of 8s on the river)\n- Board: Kh Js 4c 4h 8s\n- Final board shows: Kh Js 4c 4h 8s\n- This means I have two pair: 8s and 4s (with a K, J, 8 on board)\n- Actually, I have 8s in my hand and 8s on board, so I have a pair of 8s. The board has a pair of 4s. So I have two pair: 8s and 4s.\n\n**Pot:** 4 chips\n**Opponent:** GPT-OSS-120B who has been passive\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent actions, GPT-OSS-120B has been:\n- Mostly folding preflop (hands 5, 6, 8)\n- When they do play, they tend to check and fold later (hands 3, 4)\n- They did make one preflop raise in hand 7\n- Overall, they seem to be a relatively tight/passive player\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nThe board is Kh Js 4c 4h 8s\n- There are two pair on board: 4s and 4s (pair of 4s)\n- I have 9s 8c, so I have a pair of 8s\n- This gives me two pair: 8s and 4s\n- Possible hands that beat me:\n  - Any hand with a K (top pair), J, or 9 would give them a higher two pair\n  - Any hand with a 4 would give them trips (444)\n  - KJ would give them two pair (Kings and Jacks)\n  - Any pocket pair higher than 8s would give them a higher two pair\n\n**River Action:**\nOpponent checked to me. The pot is small (4 chips). I have a decent but not strong hand (two pair with 8s and 4s).\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: I have two pair (8s and 4s), which is decent but vulnerable\n2. **Opponent**: Seems tight/passive based on history - they likely have something when they check\n3. **Pot size**: Very small (4 chips)\n4. **Position**: I'm on the button, last to act\n5. **Board texture**: Paired board with high cards (K, J) - many hands could beat me\n\n**Options:**\n- Check: Showdown for free, see if my two pair is good\n- Bet: Try to get value from weaker hands, but risk getting called/raised by better hands\n\nGiven that the opponent has been passive and checked on the river, they likely have a marginal hand or are giving up. However, the board is somewhat scary with two pair and high cards.\n\nWith a small pot and a decent but not strong hand, checking seems appropriate. I don't want to build a bigger pot with a vulnerable hand against a passive opponent who might be trapping with a better hand.\n\nLet me check if there's any additional information I should consider...",

The current raise to 12 is a significant bet (6x BB), which suggests real strength.\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm in SB, which is terrible position\n- I have a healthy stack of 113 BB\n- Calling would commit 11 chips (about 5% of my stack) with a very weak hand\n- Even if I hit something, I'll be out of position postflop\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot before raise: 15 chips (1+2+12)\n- To call: 11 chips\n- Pot odds: 15:11 or about 1.36:1\n- This is nowhere near enough to justify calling with 57o\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- Early tournament stage (Hand #10)\n- I have a healthy stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands\n- Preserve chips for better spots\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a trivial fold. 57o from SB facing a 6x BB raise is a clear fold.

With 113 BB, I can wait for better spots rather than playing a dominated hand out of position postflop against a strong range.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: K9 offsuit (9h Kc)\n**Position**: Button (best position)\n**Stack**: 226 chips (113 BB) - healthy stack\n**Action**: MiniMax-M2 raised to 4 chips from MP (Seat 4)\n**Amount to call**: 4 chips\n**Pot odds**: 7 (current pot) + 4 (from raiser) = 11 chips, need to call 4 = 2.75:1\n\nLet me recall MiniMax-M2's tendencies:\nFrom the data, MiniMax-M2 has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in hands 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 (6 out of 7 hands)\n- Raised to 4 in hand 6 (which seems to be their standard raise size)\n- In hand 6, they showed aggression postflop with bets on flop and turn\n\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 is a tight-aggressive player who raises with strong hands. Their raise from MP likely indicates a strong range (AJ+, KQ+, 88+).\n\n**Hand analysis**:\n- K9o is a marginal hand, especially when facing a raise\n- It's dominated by many hands in a tight player's raising range (AK, KQ, KJ)\n- We have position, which helps\n- 113 BB deep, so we have room to play postflop\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: K9o is weak against a tight raiser's range\n2. **Position**: Button is good, we can act last postflop\n3. **Opponent**: Tight player raising from MP = strong range\n4. **Stack depth**: Deep enough to play speculative hands, but K9o doesn't have great implied odds\n5. **Tournament**: Early stage, no pressure yet\n\nI think calling is marginal at best. K9o is likely dominated too often. Folding is reasonable. \n\nHowever, since we're on the button with a deep stack, and facing a min-raise (2x BB), we could consider calling to see a flop in position. But given how tight MiniMax-M2 is, I'm more inclined to fold this dominated hand.\n\nLet me reconsider - the raise is only to 4 (2x BB), so it's a min-raise. We're getting 2.75:1 pot odds. With position and depth, calling might be okay, but it's still marginal.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes, this is still early tournament. I think the best play is to **fold**. K9o is just too weak against a tight player's raising range, and we don't want to get dominated.\n\nWait, let me think again. We're on the BUTTON. Position is huge. The raise is small (2x). We have a deep stack. K9o can hit some good flops (Kxx, 9x, straight draws). Maybe calling is okay?\n\nBut fundamentally, K9o is a trash hand against a tight raiser. When we hit a K, we're often dominated. When we hit a 9, it's not great. The straight potential is limited.\n\nI think the correct play is to **fold**. We can find better spots against this tight player.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket Kings (Ks Kc) in UTG position. This is the second-best starting hand in Texas Hold'em. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket Kings is an extremely strong hand, only behind pocket Aces. I should almost always play this hand aggressively.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in UTG (Under the Gun), which is the earliest position. This means I'll be out of position post-flop against most opponents. However, with such a strong hand, this is less concerning.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 226 chips (113 BB), which is a healthy stack. I can afford to play aggressively and build a pot.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the limited data I have:\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB) has folded in recent hands\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB) has raised to 4 chips in a previous hand\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) raised to 12 chips in one hand and folded to a raise in another\n   - The other Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has folded recently\n\n5. **Current Action**: It's 2 chips to call. I should definitely not fold. The question is whether to call or raise.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With a strong hand like KK, I want to build the pot and extract value. I also want to thin the field since being out of position with multiple callers is not ideal.\n\nGiven that I'm in early position with a premium hand, I should raise to:\n- Build the pot for value\n- Get information about opponents' hands\n- Thin the field\n- Take control of the hand\n\nA standard raise would be 3-4x the big blind. Since the BB is 2 chips, a raise to 6-8 chips would be appropriate. Given I'm in early position and want to charge opponents to see the flop, I'll go with a slightly larger raise.\n\nLet me raise to 8 chips (4x the BB). This is a solid, standard raise that builds the pot while still being able to fold if I face significant resistance (like a re-raise from a very tight player who might have Aces).\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I'm in UTG with Kings - this is a spot where I want to maximize value. A raise to 6-8 chips seems appropriate. I'll go with 8 chips to charge premiums and build the pot.",

This is an extremely strong hand.\n\nLet me think about the action:\n- Preflop: I raised to 8, Seat 2 called\n- Seat 2 is the only opponent left\n\nLooking at Seat 2's history from the tool:\n- Very tight player - has folded preflop most hands (hands 3-11)\n- Only raised preflop in hands 1 and 2 (both times)\n- In hand 2, they raised preflop but folded on the flop\n\nThis suggests Seat 2 is a tight-aggressive player who likely has a strong hand to call my preflop raise. Given the board texture (Ad Jd Kd), they could have:\n- An Ace (top pair)\n- A Jack (second pair)\n- A flush draw with diamonds\n- Straight draw with Q-T\n- Possibly two pair or a set\n\nMy set of Kings is currently the nuts (best possible hand) unless they have pocket Aces (which would give them a set of Aces). The board is somewhat coordinated with two diamonds and straight possibilities.\n\nGiven that I have a monster hand and want to extract value:\n1. I should definitely bet/raise here\n2. I want to build the pot while I'm likely ahead\n3. I need to charge any flush draws or straight draws\n4. The opponent is tight, so they likely have something decent\n\nSince the amount to call is 0, I can check or raise. Checking might induce a bet from them if they have something, but betting myself is better because:\n- I have a strong hand and want to build the pot\n- The board is somewhat draw-heavy (flush draw, straight draw)\n- I can get value from top pair, two pair, or draws\n\nMinimum raise is 6 chips. Given the pot is 19, a bet of around 12-16 chips would be appropriate (2/3 to 3/4 pot).\n\nLet me make a solid value bet here.",

The fact that they called my preflop raise and called on the flop suggests they have something decent.\n\nLet me think about the board and my hand:\n- I have Ks Kc (pocket Kings)\n- Board: Ad Jc Kd 5c\n- I have a set of Kings (three of a kind)\n\nThis is a very strong hand! The only hand that beats me right now is:\n- Pocket Aces (but there's an Ace on the board, so they would have had Aces preflop)\n- Or they could have made a straight with Q-10 (but that seems unlikely given their tight play)\n\nGiven the board texture:\n- There's a flush draw possibility (clubs: Jc, 5c, and I have Ks so no club)\n- There's also a potential straight draw with Q-10\n- But my set of Kings is very strong\n\nThe pot is 51 chips, and I have 202 chips. I should definitely bet for value here. My opponent has shown they call with decent hands, and they've been tight, so if they call my flop bet, they likely have something.\n\nSince there's no bet to me (amount to call is 0), I should bet. The minimum raise is 16, but that's just the minimum - I should bet more for value.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing:\n- Pot is 51\n- I could bet 30-40 chips (60-80% pot) to get value from hands like:\n  - AJ (top pair)\n  - AQ (top pair)\n  - KQ (two pair)\n  - Any flush draws\n  - Any straight draws\n\nGiven how tight my opponent has been, they're likely to have a strong hand that can call a decent sized bet.\n\nI'll go with a bet of around 35-40 chips for value.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I have a very strong hand - I have a set of Kings (Ks Kc) on a board of Ad Jc Kd 5c 3c. This gives me three Kings. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have SET of Kings (K-K-K). This is extremely strong. The board shows Ad Jc Kd 5c 3c. The only hands that beat me are:\n   - A-A (set of Aces) - very unlikely given the action\n   - J-J (set of Jacks) - possible but unlikely\n   - K-K (we have both Kings, so impossible)\n   - A-K (two pair) - we beat this\n   - Any straight? No, the board is not connected enough for a straight\n   - Any flush? The board has 3 clubs (Jc, 5c, 3c), so a flush is possible if opponent has two clubs\n\n2. **Action History**:\n   - Preflop: I raised to 8, opponent called\n   - Flop: I bet 16, opponent called\n   - Turn: I bet 40, opponent called\n   - River: I'm first to act (BB)\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: Looking at the opponent's history, Seat 2 has been very tight - folding preflop in hands 3-11. They only played hands 1 and 2. In hand 2, they raised preflop but folded on the flop. This suggests they're a tight player who only plays strong hands.\n\n4. **Pot Size**: The pot is 131 chips. My stack is 162 chips.\n\n5. **Board Texture**: There are 3 clubs on board, so a flush is possible. Also, there's an Ace and Jack, so two pair combinations like A-J, A-K, J-K are possible.\n\nGiven that my opponent has called two streets of betting (flop and turn), they likely have something. The fact that they've been very tight suggests they have a real hand. Possible hands they could have:\n- A-x (top pair)\n- J-x (second pair)\n- Two pair (A-J, A-K, J-K)\n- A flush draw that hit on the river\n- A set of Aces or Jacks\n- K-x (but we have both Kings)\n\nSince I'm out of position and my opponent has shown strength by calling twice, I should check here. If I bet and they have a flush or a better hand, I could lose a lot. If I check, I can see what they do - if they bet, I can evaluate based on the size.\n\nActually, wait. I have a very strong hand. The pot is 131 and I have 162 left. Let me reconsider:\n\n- If I check and they have a missed draw, they might check back and I lose value\n- If I bet, I can get value from worse hands\n\nGiven the opponent is tight and has called twice, they likely have at least top pair or a draw that hit. But my hand is VERY strong - only losing to sets of Aces or Jacks, or a flush.\n\nI think checking is too passive. I should bet for value. \n\nI'll carefully consider the betting strategy. With a pot-sized bet around 131 chips, I need to balance extracting value and protecting my stack. A strategic bet of 60-80 chips could maximize my potential winnings while managing risk. This approach allows me to get value from strong but inferior hands, while keeping some flexibility if the opponent shows unexpected strength.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent MiniMax-M2 has a pattern:\n- They frequently fold preflop (11 out of 19 actions were folds)\n- When they do enter pots, they tend to be aggressive post-flop (they bet on flop in hands 2, 3, and 6)\n- They raised preflop in hand 6 and then continued betting on flop and turn\n- In hand 11 they raised preflop but we don't have postflop data\n\nIn this current hand, they just called preflop (limp), which is unusual for them. This suggests they might have a medium-strength hand or a speculative hand.\n\nMy hand: Kd 6d\nBoard: Kc Jc 9h\n\nI have top pair with a weak kicker (K6). The board is very coordinated with two clubs and a straight draw possibility (Q-T would make a straight). There are many hands that could beat me or have strong draws:\n- Any K with a better kicker (KJ, K9, KQ, KT, etc.)\n- Sets (JJ, 99)\n- Two pairs (KJ, K9, J9)\n- Flush draws (any two clubs)\n- Straight draws (QT, T8, Q8)\n\nSince MiniMax-M2 limped preflop and I checked, they're now facing a decision. The pot is 5 chips. I have the option to check or bet.\n\nGiven the coordinated board and my weak kicker, I should be cautious. Checking allows me to:\n1. Control the pot size with a marginal hand\n2. See what MiniMax-M2 does - if they bet, I can evaluate based on their sizing\n3. Potentially improve on the turn (though I only have 3 outs to improve my kicker - the remaining 6s)\n\nA bet would be a protection bet, but against this opponent who tends to be aggressive when they enter pots, a check might be better to induce a bluff or keep the pot small.\n\nI think checking is the best play here.",

The small bet size of 2 into a pot of 7 (less than 30%) suggests either a weak bet or a probe bet.\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- I have top pair (Kings) with a weak kicker (6)\n- There are many draws on this board:\n  - Club flush draw (Kc, Jc on board)\n  - Straight draws (Q-T, T-8, Q-8)\n- My hand is vulnerable to many turn cards\n\n**Position and stack:**\n- I'm in BB with 291 chips (145.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- I have position on the opponent (they act first)\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Pot odds**: Getting 3.5:1, I only need ~22% equity to call\n2. **Hand strength**: Top pair but vulnerable\n3. **Opponent**: Tight player making a small bet - could be weak or could be probing\n4. **Board texture**: Very wet - many turn cards are bad for me\n5. **Tournament**: Early stage, no ICM pressure\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too weak, I have top pair and good pot odds\n- **Call**: Reasonable, see a turn card and re-evaluate\n- **Raise**: Could be good to charge draws and find out where I stand, but risks building a big pot with a marginal hand\n\nI think calling is the best option.

My kicker is 6d.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They frequently fold preflop (hands 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13)\n- When they do play, they tend to:\n  - Call preflop (hands 2, 3, 6)\n  - Bet on flop/turn (hands 2, 3, 6)\n  - In hand 6, they raised preflop, bet flop 8, bet turn 8, then checked river\n\nSo MiniMax-M2 is somewhat aggressive when they do play, but they fold a lot preflop. The board has a flush draw (3 clubs). I have trips with a weak kicker.\n\nGiven the board texture:\n- There are 3 Kings on board, so I have trips\n- Possible straight draws (Q-T would make a straight)\n- Possible flush draw (3 clubs)\n- My kicker is weak (6d)\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2 bet 2 on the flop and I called. The turn is Kh which gives me trips. There's no bet to call on the turn (amount to call is 0).\n\nI should consider:\n1. If MiniMax-M2 has a King, they likely have a better kicker than me\n2. They could have a flush draw\n3. They could have a straight draw\n4. They could be bluffing with air\n\nWith trips on a board with potential draws, I should bet for value and protection.

The board is paired with Kc-Kh, and there are potential flush and straight draws that may have missed or completed.\n\nLet me review the hand action:\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called 2 (limped in)\n- Flop: I checked, MiniMax-M2 bet 2, I called\n- Turn: I bet 8, MiniMax-M2 called\n- River: I can check or bet\n\nThe opponent's action pattern (from the recall):\n- MiniMax-M2 has been relatively tight, folding preflop many times\n- When they do play, they tend to bet aggressively postflop (bet 2 on flop in hand 3, bet 2 on turn in hand 3)\n- In hand 6, they raised preflop, bet 8 on flop, bet 8 on turn, then checked river\n- They seem to be a straightforward player who bets with strength and checks when weak\n\n**Current situation analysis:**\n1. **My hand strength:** I have trip Kings, which is very strong. Only hands beating me are:\n   - KJ (full house)\n   - KK (quads - unlikely since I have Kd)\n   - Any pocket pair that made a full house (99, JJ)\n   - A hand like K9 or KJ would have me beat\n\n2. **Opponent's range:** \n   - They limped preflop, so unlikely to have premium pairs\n   - They bet the flop for 2 into a pot of 5 (40% pot)\n   - They called my turn bet of 8\n   - This suggests they have something - could be a King with weaker kicker, a flush draw, straight draw, or maybe a Jack\n\n3. **Board texture:**\n   - Two clubs on flop (Kc Jc), one club on river (4c) - flush possible\n   - Straight draws possible with Q-T, but no 8 or T on board to complete\n   - The 4c on river could complete a flush for someone holding two clubs\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies:**\n   - From the recall, MiniMax-M2 tends to bet when they have something\n   - They called my turn bet, suggesting they have some strength\n   - They haven't shown any bluffing tendencies\n\n5. **Decision:** I should bet for value here. I have trip Kings which is likely the best hand. I need to extract value from:\n   - Weaker Kings (Kx)\n   - Jacks (trip Jacks)\n   - Maybe 9s (trip 9s)\n   - Missed flush draws that might call a small bet\n\nThe pot is 25 chips. A value bet of around 50-60% pot (12-15 chips) seems appropriate. This allows weaker hands to call while protecting against the flush.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing. Since I can raise to minimum 8, but that's too small. I should bet around 15-20 chips for value. The minimum raise is 8, but I can raise to any amount above that. I'll bet 15 chips which is 60% of pot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: SB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: Js 6s (Jacks of spades, 6 of spades)\n- Stack: 305 chips (152.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 5 chips\n- Amount to call: 1 chip\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Table dynamics:**\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has called 2 chips (only player besides me still in)\n- Everyone else folded\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- Js 6s is a speculative hand - suited one-gapper\n- In SB, I'm out of position for the rest of the hand\n- This is a marginal hand at best\n\n**Opponent analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the search results, I can see GPT-OSS-120B's patterns:\n- Hand 5: Folded to my raise\n- Hand 6: Folded to MiniMax-M2's raise\n- Hand 7: Raised to 8 (won without showdown)\n- Hand 8: Folded to DeepSeek-V3.2's raise\n- Hand 9: Called 1 in BB, then checked down (lost to my 9s8c)\n- Hand 10: Raised to 12 (everyone folded)\n- Hand 11: Folded to MiniMax-M2's raise\n- Hand 12: Folded to my raise with KK\n- Hand 13: Called 4, bet 8 on flop, folded on turn\n- Hand 14: Folded\n\nPattern: GPT-OSS-120B seems to play somewhat tight. They raise with strong hands (like in hands 7, 10) but also call sometimes (hand 9, 13). In this hand, they just called 2, which could mean:\n- Medium strength hand\n- Trying to see a flop cheaply\n- Not super strong (would likely raise)\n\n**My decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Js6s is weak, especially OOP\n2. **Position**: I'll be OOP postflop, which is bad for a marginal hand\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 1 to win 5 (5:1 odds) - decent odds\n4. **Implied odds**: With suited cards, there's some potential if I hit a flush\n5. **Stack size**: I have a big stack (152.5 BB), so calling 1 chip is trivial\n6. **Tournament**: Early stage, no pressure\n\n**Conclusion**: While Js6s is weak, the pot odds are good (5:1), I'm getting a discount in the SB, and the investment is tiny relative to my stack. I have suited cards with some potential. However, I'll be OOP which is a significant disadvantage.\n\nGiven that GPT-OSS-120B just called (rather than raised), they likely don't have a premium hand. This makes it slightly more attractive to see a flop.\n\nI think calling is slightly better than folding here. The price is right, and while I'll be OOP, the stack preservation cost is minimal. I could also consider raising to try to take it down now, but that's risky with a weak hand OOP.\n\nLet me just call and see the flop.",

Board is 7h Qs Th. With Js, I have Q-J-T on board. I need K for K-Q-J-T-9 straight, or 9 for Q-J-T-9-8. So I have a gutshot to a straight (need K or 9).\n- Actually, let me be more precise: I have Js. Board is 7h Qs Th. So I have Q-J-T. For a straight, I need K-9 or 9-8. So I need a K or a 9 to make a straight. That's a gutshot straight draw (4 outs).\n- For the flush: I have Js 6s, and there's Qs on board. So I need two more spades. There are 13 spades in the deck total. I have 2, board has 1, so 10 spades left. So I have a flush draw.\n\nActually, wait. Let me recalculate. I have Js and 6s. The board has Qs. That's 3 spades total. I need 2 more spades to make a flush. So I have a flush draw that needs two cards to complete. That's not a standard flush draw - it's more like a backdoor flush draw. Actually, it's a two-card flush draw, which is very weak.\n\nLet me recount the spades:\n- My hand: Js, 6s\n- Board: Qs\n- Total spades I can see: 3\n- Spades left in deck: 10\n- I need 2 spades on turn and river to make a flush\n\nSo I have a backdoor flush draw (need two spades).\n\nFor the straight:\n- I have J-6\n- Board: 7-Q-T\n- I have Q-J-T on board\n- I need K-9 or 9-8 to make a straight\n- So I need a K or 9 for a gutshot straight draw\n- That's 4 outs (4 Kings, 4 Nines = 8 outs)\n\nWait, let me think about the straight again.

They called preflop with position on us.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 6 chips, I can check for free. If I bet, minimum raise is 2 chips.\n\n**Hand strength:**\nI have a flush draw (9 outs out of 46 unknown cards = ~19.6% chance to hit on river). This is a decent draw but not the nut flush (someone could have As or Ks). Also, the board is paired (two 7s), which means someone could have a full house already.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in SB, which is out of position. There are two players behind me (BB with 126 chips, and Seat 5 with 179 chips).\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that:\n1. I have a decent flush draw (9 outs)\n2. It's checked to me and I can see a free card\n3. I'm out of position against two players\n4. The board is paired, reducing the value of my flush\n5. I have no fold equity by betting since opponents have shown passive tendencies\n\n\n6. Checking is free, so I can realize my equity without risk\n\nI'll take the cautious approach and check. This allows me to see the river card without investing additional chips, preserving my tournament stack while maintaining the potential to complete my flush draw. The free card gives me a chance to improve my hand without unnecessary risk.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river decision step by step:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I have Js 6s on the button\n- Board: 7h Qs Th 7s Ac\n- Pot: 10 chips\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) bet 4 on the river\n- I need to call 4 to see showdown\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**My hand evaluation:**\n- Js 6s - I have a flush draw that missed\n- Final board: 7h Qs Th 7s Ac\n- I have: Jack high\n- No pair, no straight, no flush\n- This is a very weak hand\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the opponent actions I can see:\n- Seat 2 has been very tight preflop (lots of folds)\n- They only played hands #1, #2, and #12\n- In hand #12 they called all the way to the river then folded\n- They just bet on the river in this hand after checking all previous streets\n\n**The action in this hand:**\n- Preflop: Seat 5 called, I called, Seat 2 checked (big blind)\n- Flop: All three players checked (7h Qs Th)\n- Turn: All three players checked (7s)\n- River: I checked, Seat 2 bet 4, Seat 5 folded\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe board is 7h Qs Th 7s Ac - there are two pairs on board (7s and Qs/Ts), and a possible flush. \n\nSeat 2's pattern suggests they're tight. They've checked all streets then suddenly bet the river. This is often a value bet with a made hand. The fact that Seat 5 folded suggests they didn't have much either.\n\nI only have Jack high. Even if my opponent is bluffing, my Jack high might not be good. They could have:\n- Any Ace (they have me beat)\n- Any Queen or Ten (they have me beat)\n- Any 7 (they have trips)\n- Any pocket pair\n- A missed flush draw that still beats me\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 to win 14 (10 pot + 4 bet), so 3.5:1 odds. I need to win ~22% of the time to break even.\n \nI can't justify calling with just Jack high against a tight player's river bet. The lack of bluffing opportunities and my weak hand make folding the most sensible choice. The opponent's consistent checking and sudden river bet strongly suggest they have a real hand, making my chances of winning extremely slim.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - great position\n- Cards: 6s 6h - pocket sixes, a medium pair\n- Stack: 304 chips (152 BB) - very healthy stack\n- Pot: 13 chips\n- Blinds: 1/2\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): posted 1\n- Seat 3 (BB): posted 2  \n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): raised to 4\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): raised to 6\n\nSo I need to call 6 to see the flop. The minimum raise would be to 8.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n\n**Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2):**\n- Recent preflop actions: fold, fold, raise(4), fold, fold, call(2), bet(2), call(8), fold, fold\n- Seems tight, raises occasionally to small amounts\n- Their raise to 4 here is a min-raise from UTG+1 position\n- They showed down Qs Ks previously (strong hand)\n\n**Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B):**\n- Recent preflop actions: fold, call(4), bet(8), check, fold, fold, call(2), check, check, fold\n- Also relatively tight, but more active than Seat 4\n- Their raise to 6 here is a small re-raise (3x the BB)\n- They showed down As 5h previously (ace-rag suited)\n\n**My Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket sixes is a medium pair. It's vulnerable to overcards but has good potential against 1-2 opponents. On the button, I have position advantage.\n\n2. **Action**: There's been a raise and a re-raise. This suggests at least one of them has a real hand. The raises are small (4 and 6), which could indicate:\n   - Strong hands trying to build a pot\n   - Medium strength hands probing\n   - Light 3-bets\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 6 to win 13. That's about 2.17:1 pot odds. This is marginal for pocket sixes in a multi-way pot with action.\n\n4. **Implied Odds**: If I hit a set (about 1 in 8.5 chance), I could win a big pot. With 304 chips, I have deep stacks relative to the bet.\n\n5. **Opponent Tendencies**: Both opponents seem relatively tight based on their histories. The small raise sizes might indicate they're not super strong, but I can't be certain.\n\n6. **Position**: Being on the button is excellent. I'll act last on all postflop streets.\n\n7. **Tournament Consideration**: My stack is healthy at 152 BB. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position.\n\n**Decision**: With pocket sixes on the button, facing two small raises, I think calling is the best play. Raising would be too aggressive with a medium pair facing action, and folding is too tight given my position, hand potential, and stack depth. I want to see the flop in position and evaluate.\n\nThe call is 6 chips which is only 2% of my stack - very manageable. If I hit a set, I can potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold to further aggression.",

A medium pair, good for set mining.\n\n**Position:** Button (BTN) - Excellent position, last to act postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 298 chips (149 BB) - Deep stack relative to blinds.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Pot is 47 chips\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 4, then re-raised to 8 after Seat 5's raise to 6\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6, then raised to 30\n- I called the initial raise to 6\n- Now I need to call 24 more (30 - 6 = 24) to see the flop\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):**\n- Shows a pattern of folding preflop frequently (folded in hands 9, 10, 12, 13, 15)\n- Only raised preflop in hand 11 (amount 4)\n- Called in hand 14, then bet flop, called turn, folded river\n- Showed down KQs in hand 6\n- Seems relatively tight/passive\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5):**\n- More active than Seat 4\n- Called in hands 13 and 15\n- Made a flop bet in hand 13 then folded on turn\n- Showed down A5s in hand 9\n- Seems capable of making moves\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 66 is a set-mining hand. I need to hit a set (about 12% chance on flop) to feel confident.\n2. **Pot odds:** Need to call 24 to win 47 = ~51% pot odds. This is not good for a set-mining hand that hits only 12% of the time.\n3. **Implied odds:** If I hit my set, I could win a big pot. Both opponents have shown they can put chips in.\n4. **Position:** Being on the button is great - I can control the action postflop.\n5. **Action:** There's been a 3-bet and 4-bet sequence. Seat 5's raise to 30 is significant (15 BB).\n6. **Stack preservation:** I have a healthy stack. Calling 24 chips would leave me with 274 chips, which is still good.\n\n**Decision:** This is a fold. The pot odds are terrible for set mining (need about 8:1 implied odds minimum, getting less than 2:1 immediate). While I have position, the 4-bet to 30 suggests real strength from Seat 5. With 66, I'm likely dominated by higher pairs or flipping against overcards. The risk isn't worth it.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I already invested 6 chips. The pot is 47, I need to call 24 more. That's about 2:1 pot odds. For set mining, I need much better implied odds. The 4-bet suggests strong hands. Even though I'm on the button, 66 doesn't play well against the range that 4-bets to 30. I should fold and preserve my chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my hand, I have Qd 3d - a very weak hand from UTG position. This is definitely a fold in most situations.\n\nKey factors:\n1. Hand strength: Q3s is extremely weak, even suited. It's dominated by many hands and has very poor playability postflop.\n2. Position: UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act on every street and have no information about opponents' intentions.\n3. Stack size: I have 298 chips (149 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take risks.\n4. Opponent tendencies: From the recall, I can see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 has been aggressive (raised preflop in hand 16, made big bets)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been very aggressive (re-raised multiple times in hand 16)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 folded to a raise in hand 16\n   - Kimi-K2 folded to a raise in hand 16\n\nThis suggests there are aggressive players behind me who could easily raise if I limp in. Even calling the 2-chip big blind is dangerous because I could face a raise and have to fold, losing chips unnecessarily.\n\nThe only consideration is that I have a suited hand (diamonds), which gives me some slim potential for a flush. But the chances of hitting a flush are very low (about 6.5% on the flop), and even if I do hit, I could be dominated by higher diamonds.\n\nFrom UTG with a weak hand like Q3s against aggressive opponents, this is an easy fold. I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots.",

KTo is a hand that can be:\n1. Folded - safest play, avoids tough postflop spots OOP\n2. Called - cheap price, deep stack, can hit strong hands\n3. 3-bet - could work as a bluff/semi-bluff but risky OOP\n\nGiven:\n- MiniMax seems to raise frequently, so their range is likely wide\n- The price is very cheap (2 chips to call)\n- I have position disadvantage but deep stack to realize equity\n- KTo has decent equity against wide ranges\n\nI think calling is reasonable here. I'm getting good pot odds, have a deep stack, and KTo can flop well (top pair, straight draws). The opponent seems active enough that they could be raising with many worse hands.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious postflop and ready to fold if I don't hit something strong.\n\nLet me make the call.",

The board is coordinated and my opponent is aggressive. I should not be betting here with King high. Checking is the only reasonable option. I need to see if they bet and decide based on their sizing, but with no pair and no draw, I'm ready to fold to any significant bet.\n\nI should check and see what my opponent does. If they bet small, I might consider calling with my King high and backdoor draws, but I'm likely just giving up on this hand.",

A weak hand trying to see where they stand\n  2. A strong hand trying to extract value\n  3. A continuation bet with air\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 11, I need to call 2\n- Getting 5.5:1 odds\n- With King-high, I'm likely behind but the odds are good\n\n**Decision:**\nI have nothing but King-high. The board is coordinated (9-5-6 could connect with many hands). However, the bet is very small (2 into 11), giving me great pot odds. I should probably fold because:\n1. I have no pair, no draw\n2. The board is somewhat coordinated\n3. Even though odds are good, I'm likely drawing dead or need to hit a K\n\n\n4. I don't want to build a pot with such a weak hand\n\nI'll fold this hand, preserving my stack for better opportunities. The minimal pot odds don't justify continuing with such a weak holding against an opponent showing strength.",

This is a standard raise size. Given their tight folding pattern, when they do raise, they likely have a strong hand.\n\nMy hand: 9s 8s\n- Suited connector, decent potential but not strong\n- On the button, so I have position\n- My stack is 292 chips (146 BB), very healthy\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 to win 14 (8+6), so about 3.5:1 or ~28.6% equity needed.\n\nAgainst a tight opponent's raising range (likely strong hands like pocket pairs, big aces, big broadway hands), 98s has roughly 30-35% equity, which makes it borderline profitable to call given position and implied odds.\n\nHowever, I should consider:\n1. This is a tournament, I want to preserve my stack but also accumulate\n2. I have position which is valuable\n3. Suited connectors play well in position\n4. The opponent is tight but not extremely aggressive\n5.

That's approximately 16% chance to hit on the turn (8/47). With backdoor flush draw, I have some additional equity.\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm in position (button)\n- Opponent seems tight and has shown willingness to fold\n- I have a strong draw\n- Pot is small (12 chips)\n- Checking gives a free card but I lose initiative\n\nI think a small semi-bluff raise is appropriate here to:\n1. Take control of the hand\n2. Apply pressure to a tight opponent\n3. Potentially win the pot immediately\n\n\n4. Build the pot for when I hit my draw\n\nI'll carefully consider the optimal bet sizing to maximize pressure while minimizing risk. A strategic raise of around 8 chips could effectively represent strength and potentially force my opponent to fold their marginal hands. This approach balances aggression with pot control, giving me multiple ways to win the hand.\n\nThe key is to apply just enough pressure to make my opponent uncomfortable without overcommitting my stack. By raising to 8, I'm signaling strength while keeping my options open for future streets.",

          "reasoning_content": "  This is a tournament situation. Let me analyze the current hand:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- My hand: 9s 8s (9 of spades, 8 of spades)\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- My stack: 280 chips (140 BB)\n- Board: Ts Jc 4h 3c\n- Pot: 28 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the button (position is good)\n- I have 9-8 suited (originally spades, but board has Ts so my flush draw is gone)\n- The board shows: Ts Jc 4h 3c\n- So I have: 9s 8s\n- Board: Ts Jc 4h 3c\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have an open-ended straight draw: I need a Q or a 7 to complete a straight (7-8-9-T-J or 8-9-T-J-Q)\n- I have 8 outs (4 Queens, 4 Sevens)\n- However, if a Q comes, someone might have K-Q for a higher straight\n- The Ts on board means my spade flush draw is dead (I can't make a flush)\n- I have no pair, just a straight draw\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 28 chips\n- If I bet, minimum raise is 8 chips\n- I have 8 outs out of 46 unknown cards = ~17.4% chance to hit on river\n- Pot odds if I bet 8: 28:8 or 3.5:1, which means I need ~22% equity to break even\n- My actual equity is ~17.4%, so mathematically I don't have enough equity for a value bet\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n- Opponent is Kimi-K2 in seat 2 (BB)\n- They have 120 chips (60 BB)\n- Looking at their history: They fold a LOT preflop, but when they do play, they seem to call down\n- In hand 12, they called flop and turn, then folded river\n- In hand 15, they checked down and bet small on river\n- In hand 17, they raised preflop to 6 (which is what they did this hand)\n\n**Current action:**\n- Preflop: I called their raise (they raised to 6, I called)\n- Flop: I bet 8, they called\n- Turn: It's checked to me, I can check or raise\n\n**My thought process:**\n1. I have a straight draw with 8 outs\n2. The pot is 28 chips\n3. I have position (on the button)\n4. My opponent has been passive/calling station tendencies\n5. I don't have enough equity to value bet the turn\n\n\n6. Checking is the most strategic move here. I'll preserve my chips, maintain control, and potentially see a free river card that could complete my straight. This approach minimizes risk while keeping my options open for a potential river play.",

          "content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN (Seat 1) with 9s 8s\n- Stack: 280 chips (140 BB)\n- Board: Ts Jc 4h 3c Ad\n- Pot: 28 chips\n- It's on the river, and action is on me\n- I can check or raise (no one has bet yet on the river)\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have 9s 8s - no pair, just a missed straight draw\n- The board shows: Ts Jc 4h 3c Ad\n- This gives me absolutely nothing - I don't even have a pair\n- The board has an Ace, Jack, Ten, Four, Three - all different suits\n- Best hand I could make is Ace-high with my 9 kicker\n\n**Action history:**\n- Preflop: I called from SB, opponent raised to 6, I called\n- Flop: I bet 8, opponent called\n- Turn: I checked, opponent checked\n- River: Action is on me\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 120 chips left\n- They called my flop bet but checked the turn\n- This suggests they might have something but not a strong hand\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check - Showdown with my Ace-high\n2. Bet/Raise - Try to bluff them off a hand\n\n**Key considerations:**\n- I have absolutely no showdown value (Ace-high with 9 kicker)\n- The Ace on the river is scary for many hands\n- If they had a strong hand (like a pair of Jacks or Tens), they might have bet the turn\n- Their turn check suggests weakness\n- I have position and can represent the Ace\n- Pot is 28 chips, I could make a small value bet or bluff\n\nLet me think about what hands they could have:\n- They could have a Jack (AJ, KJ, QJ, Jx) - but would they check turn?\n- They could have a Ten (AT, KT, QT) - but again, might bet turn\n- They could have a pocket pair (66-QQ) - checking turn makes sense\n- They could have a missed draw - checking turn makes sense\n\nGiven that they called the flop but checked the turn, they likely have a marginal hand or a draw that missed. The Ace on the river is a great bluff card.\n\nSince I have no showdown value, I should either:\n1. Check and give up (conservative)\n2. Make a small bluff bet to try to win the pot\n\nGiven it's a tournament and I have a healthy stack, I could try a small bluff here. A bet of around 15-20 chips could be enough to make them fold marginal hands.\n\nBut wait, let me reconsider - I have Ace-high. If they have a worse Ace (like A2-A8), I might actually be ahead. But it's more likely they have some pair or better.\n\nActually, looking at the board again: Ts Jc 4h 3c Ad\n- If they have any pair (44, JJ, TT), they beat me\n- If they have any Ace, they beat me (unless it's A2-A8, but then we're splitting or they win)\n- If they have King-high, I win\n- If they have Queen-high, I win\n\nThe problem is most hands that called the flop and checked turn are either:\n1. Marginal pairs (44, 66-99, maybe JJ/TT)\n2. Draws that missed\n3. Ace-high that they're trying to showdown\n\nIf I bet, I might fold out:\n- Missed draws\n- Some weaker pairs\n- Ace-high hands\n\nBut I might get called by:\n- Any pair\n- Any Ace\n\nGiven the pot is 28, I could make a small bluff of maybe 16-20 chips. But is it worth it?\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. I have position and the opponent showed weakness on the turn. The Ace is a great scare card. If they had an Ace, they might have bet the turn. If they have a pair, the Ace is scary.\n\nBut I have literally nothing. Ace-high with 9 kicker is not winning at showdown often enough to justify checking. \n\nI think the best play is to check. Here's why:\n1. I have some showdown value with Ace-high\n2. A bluff might not work often enough to be profitable\n3. The opponent called the flop, so they have something\n4. It's a small pot, not worth risking chips\n5. If I check and they have nothing, I might win anyway\n\nWait, but I have 9-high, not Ace-high! The board has an Ace, but I don't have an Ace in my hand. I have 9s"

Check and lose at showdown (since I have 9-high)\n2. Make a bluff bet to try to win the pot\n\nGiven the Ace on the river is a scare card, and my opponent checked both turn and river, showing weakness, a bluff could work. However, they called the flop bet, so they likely have something.\n\nSince I have zero showdown value, I need to either bluff or give up. The pot is 28 chips. \n\nActually, wait - I need to reconsider. If I bet and get called, I lose the bet. If I check, I lose the pot. Since I have 9-high, I cannot win at showdown. So checking is just giving up.\n\nA small bluff might be worth it. The opponent showed weakness by checking turn and river. The Ace is scary. I could bet around 16-20 chips.\n\nBut let me think about the opponent's stack. They have 120 chips left. A bet of 16-20 chips is meaningful but not huge.\n\nHowever, without any specific reads on this opponent, and given that they called the flop, I think the conservative play is to check and give up. Bluffing without any equity or reads is generally not profitable.\n\nActually, I just realized - I have position and my opponent has shown weakness by checking twice (turn and river). This is a good spot to bluff. Since I have no showdown value, I should either bluff or fold (check-fold).\n\nGiven the Ace is a scare card and the opponent checked twice, I think a small bluff is appropriate. I'll bet around 16 chips (just over half pot) to try to take it down.\n\nWait, but the minimum raise is 8 chips. So I could bet as little as 8 chips or more. A small bet of 8-12 chips might look like a value bet and could get folds from hands that are beating me.\n\nLet me reconsider again. I have 9-high. I literally cannot win unless I bluff. The opponent:\n- Raised preflop (showing strength)\n- Called my flop bet (has something)\n- Checked turn (weakness)\n- Checked river (weakness)\n\nThe turn and river checks suggest they don't have a strong hand. The Ace on the river is scary. This is actually a decent bluff spot.\n\nI'll make a small bet that looks like a value bet. Something like 12-16 chips.\n\nActually, you know what, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me check what hands I lose to:\n- Any pair (44, 66-QQ)\n- Any Ace\n- Any two cards that make a pair with the board\n\nAnd I only beat:\n- Complete air (which might just check back anyway)\n- King-high, Queen-high (unlikely to call flop)\n\nSince the opponent called the flop, they likely have at least some pair or draw. The turn check suggests the draw missed or they have a weak pair. The river Ace is scary to weak pairs.\n\nBut I think the most prudent play here, without reads, is to just check and give up. It's not worth risking chips in this spot.\n\nWait, I need to make a decision. Let me think about this differently. If I check, I lose 100% of the time. If I bet, I might win some percentage of the time. What size should I bet?\n\nGiven the pot is 28, a bet of 14 (half pot) or less could work. But I need to think about what the opponent has. They raised preflop, so they could have:\n- Big pairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT) - but would check turn and river?\n- AK, AQ, AJ, AT - but would check turn and river?\n- Medium pairs (99-77) - possible\n- Suited connectors - possible\n\nActually, if they had a big hand, they'd likely bet turn or river. The checks suggest weakness. \n\nI think I should make a small bluff here. Let me bet 12 chips. This is less than half pot and might get folds from marginal hands.\n\nBut wait - the minimum raise is 8 chips, and I can raise to any amount 8 or higher. So betting 12 is fine.\n\nActually, I'm going to be conservative here. Without specific reads that this opponent can fold marginal hands, I'll check and give up. It's not worth the risk.\n\nNo wait"

Check - Showdown with my Ace-high\n2. Bet/Raise - Try to bluff them off a hand\n\n**Key considerations:**\n- I have absolutely no showdown value (Ace-high with 9 kicker)\n- The Ace on the river is scary for many hands\n- If they had a strong hand (like a pair of Jacks or Tens), they might have bet the turn\n- Their turn check suggests weakness\n- I have position and can represent the Ace\n- Pot is 28 chips, I could make a small value bet or bluff\n\nLet me think about what hands they could have:\n- They could have a Jack (AJ, KJ, QJ, Jx) - but would they check turn?\n- They could have a Ten (AT, KT, QT) - but again, might bet turn\n- They could have a pocket pair (66-QQ) - checking turn makes sense\n- They could have a missed draw - checking turn makes sense\n\nGiven that they called the flop but checked the turn, they likely have a marginal hand or a draw that missed. The Ace on the river is a great bluff card.\n\nSince I have no showdown value, I should either:\n1. Check and give up (conservative)\n2. Make a small bluff bet to try to win the pot\n\nGiven it's a tournament and I have a healthy stack, I could try a small bluff here. A bet of around 15-20 chips could be enough to make them fold marginal hands.\n\nBut wait, let me reconsider - I have Ace-high. If they have a worse Ace (like A2-A8), I might actually be ahead. But it's more likely they have some pair or better.\n\nActually, looking at the board again: Ts Jc 4h 3c Ad\n- If they have any pair (44, JJ, TT), they beat me\n- If they have any Ace, they beat me (unless it's A2-A8, but then we're splitting or they win)\n- If they have King-high, I win\n- If they have Queen-high, I win\n\nThe problem is most hands that called the flop and checked turn are either:\n1. Marginal pairs (44, 66-99, maybe JJ/TT)\n2. Draws that missed\n3. Ace-high that they're trying to showdown\n\nIf I bet, I might fold out:\n- Missed draws\n- Some weaker pairs\n- Ace-high hands\n\nBut I might get called by:\n- Any pair\n- Any Ace\n\nGiven the pot is 28, I could make a small bluff of maybe 16-20 chips. But is it worth it?\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. I have position and the opponent showed weakness on the turn. The Ace is a great scare card. If they had an Ace, they might have bet the turn. If they have a pair, the Ace is scary.\n\nBut I have literally nothing. Ace-high with 9 kicker is not winning at showdown often enough to justify checking. \n\nI think the best play is to check. Here's why:\n1. I have some showdown value with Ace-high\n2. A bluff might not work often enough to be profitable\n3. The opponent called the flop, so they have something\n4. It's a small pot, not worth risking chips\n5. If I check and they have nothing, I might win anyway\n\nWait, but I have 9-high, not Ace-high! The board has an Ace, but I don't have an Ace in my hand. I have 9s",

Check and lose at showdown (since I have 9-high)\n2. Make a bluff bet to try to win the pot\n\nGiven the Ace on the river is a scare card, and my opponent checked both turn and river, showing weakness, a bluff could work. However, they called the flop bet, so they likely have something.\n\nSince I have zero showdown value, I need to either bluff or give up. The pot is 28 chips. \n\nActually, wait - I need to reconsider. If I bet and get called, I lose the bet. If I check, I lose the pot. Since I have 9-high, I cannot win at showdown.

A bet of 16-20 chips is meaningful but not huge.\n\nHowever, without any specific reads on this opponent, and given that they called the flop, I think the conservative play is to check and give up. Bluffing without any equity or reads is generally not profitable.\n\nActually, I just realized - I have position and my opponent has shown weakness by checking twice (turn and river). This is a good spot to bluff. Since I have no showdown value, I should either bluff or fold (check-fold).\n\nGiven the Ace is a scare card and the opponent checked twice, I think a small bluff is appropriate. I'll bet around 16 chips (just over half pot) to try to take it down.\n\nWait, but the minimum raise is 8 chips. So I could bet as little as 8 chips or more.

The opponent:\n- Raised preflop (showing strength)\n- Called my flop bet (has something)\n- Checked turn (weakness)\n- Checked river (weakness)\n\nThe turn and river checks suggest they don't have a strong hand.

I lose to:\n   - Any pair (44, JJ, TT, or any pocket pair)\n   - Any Ace (Ax)\n   - Any two cards that make a pair with the board\n   - Literally any hand that isn't 8-high or worse\n\n2. **Showdown value**: Zero.

Without any reads on this specific opponent, and given that they called the flop (showing they have something), a bluff is quite risky. \n\nThe most prudent play is to check and give up. It's a small pot, and risking chips without a strong read isn't optimal. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nActually, I'm going back to the bluff.

Looking at their history, they seem tight-aggressive. They've folded preflop several times, raised to 6 a couple times, and defended their blind once (hand 20). They called a flop bet and river bet in hand 20, showing they can defend.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - 205 chips. Very tight! They've folded preflop 4 out of 5 recent hands, only calling once. When they called, they checked down to showdown with A3.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN, which is great position postflop.\n\n**Hand Strength:** Qd Td is a good suited connector hand, especially on the button. It has good postflop playability and can make strong hands.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Position advantage:** BTN is the best position\n2. **Hand playability:** QTs suited is a solid raising hand from BTN\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** SB is moderately aggressive, BB is very tight\n4. **Stack sizes:** I have a healthy stack, can afford to play this hand\n5. **Pot odds:** Need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1), which is marginal but position makes up for it\n\nGiven I'm on the BTN with a playable suited hand, and the BB is very tight (folding 80% of the time), I should raise to:\n- Steal the blinds\n- Build the pot when I have position\n- Put pressure on the tight BB\n\nA standard raise would be 3x the BB = 12 chips. This is a good steal size and gives me control postflop.\n\nLet me raise to 12.",

Could be:\n- An Ace (top pair)\n- A Jack (second pair)\n- A flush draw\n- Or a complete bluff\n\n**My situation**:\n- I have a gutshot + backdoor flush draw\n- I have position (acting last)\n- I have a healthy stack (256 chips)\n- If I call 24, I'll have 232 left (58 BB)\n\n\n- Opponent has 100 chips remaining, which is quite short\n\nI realize my pot odds are terrible. The 2.17:1 pot odds mean I need 31.6% equity, but my actual equity is much lower at 8-12%. While I have some potential with my gutshot and backdoor flush, the risk of losing another bet on the turn makes this a clear fold. Despite having position, the opponent's likely strong hand and my limited outs make continuing unwise. I should preserve my chips for better opportunities.",

Even if I hit a Jack, I'll often be outkicked, and the hand has poor playability postflop.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand, I'm in UTG (first position) with Js 5d. This is a very weak hand - Jack-5 offsuit is not a playable hand from early position in most situations.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Hand strength**: Js 5d is a weak, offsuit hand with no connectivity. The Jack is decent but the 5 kicker is terrible. This hand has poor postflop playability.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (under the gun), the worst position preflop. I have 7 players left to act behind me. When playing from early position, I need to be very tight and only play premium hands.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 256 chips (64 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Opponent observations**: Looking at the opponent actions I recalled:\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) has been folding a lot preflop\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has shown some aggression (raised in hand 19)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) is very short stacked and has been folding a lot\n   - Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been somewhat active with raises and calls\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a 64 BB stack, I'm in no danger. I should be selective and wait for better spots. Playing marginal hands from early position can lead to difficult postflop situations and unnecessary chip loss.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I would need to call 4 chips to see a flop. While the pot odds are decent (6:4 or 1.5:1), this doesn't matter much with such a weak hand from bad position. The implied odds are poor because even if I hit a Jack, I'll often be outkicked, and hitting a 5 rarely makes me a strong hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Jack-5 offsuit from UTG is not a profitable play, even at a potentially loose table. I should preserve my chips for better spots and better hands.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand. I'm in UTG (under the gun) position, which is the earliest position. I have 9s 6s - a suited connector but a weak hand, especially from early position.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Hand strength**: 96s is a speculative hand. It can make straights and flushes, but it's very weak in terms of high card value. From UTG, this is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: Being UTG means I have 4 players left to act behind me. This is the worst position to play a marginal hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 256 chips (64 BB). This is a decent stack size, but not deep enough to play speculative hands from early position without good implied odds.\n\n4. **Opponents**: Let me check what I know about the other players:\n   - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - has been aggressive with raises\n   - Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - seems tight\n   - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - has shown aggression\n   - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - short stack with only 37 chips\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I should be looking to preserve my stack and wait for better spots, especially from early position.\n\nLet me look at my recent hands to see if there's any pattern:\n\nFrom the search results:\n- Hand 18: I folded Q9c from UTG (reasonable)\n- Hand 17: I folded Q3d from CO (reasonable)\n- Hand 16: I called with 66 from BTN and folded to pressure (reasonable)\n- Hand 15: I folded Js6s from SB after calling preflop (lost to river bet)\n- Hand 14: I won with Kd6d from BB (hit trips)\n\nThe pattern shows I've been playing fairly tight, which is appropriate. \n\n96s from UTG is a clear fold. Even though it's suited, the gap makes it less valuable than connected suited cards like 87s or T9s. From early position with multiple players to act, this is a standard fold.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips (2+4 blinds), and I need to call 4 chips. While the pot odds are 1.5:1 (25% equity needed), this hand doesn't have enough equity against the ranges of players behind me, and the implied odds aren't sufficient from this position.\n\nDecision: FOLD",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: 6s 5c (suited connector, but low)\n- Stack: 252 chips (63 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- Amount to call: 4 (the small blind raised from 2 to 8, so I need to put in 4 more to call)\n\n**Situation:**\n- Everyone folded except Seat 5 (small blind) who raised to 8\n- I'm on the button with 6-5 offsuit (6s 5c)\n- I need to call 4 chips to see a flop\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 6-5 offsuit is a weak hand. It's not suited, and the cards are low. This hand has very little showdown value.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position post-flop. This is an advantage.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 5 has a very small stack (29 chips, ~7 BB). This is a short stack. Their raise from SB could be:\n   - A strong hand trying to get value\n   - A desperation move with a weak hand (given their short stack)\n   - A standard steal attempt\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 to win 12 chips, so I'm getting 3:1 pot odds. This means I need ~25% equity to call.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (63 BB) vs opponent's short stack (7 BB). \n\nLet me think about what hands Seat 5 might have from the SB with such a short stack. With 29 chips left, they might be:\n- Shoving all-in with any decent hand\n- Raising to 8 to induce action\n- Making a desperation play\n\nGiven that they only raised to 8 (not all-in), they might have:\n- A medium strength hand that wants action\n- A strong hand that wants to trap\n- A steal attempt\n\nWith 6-5 offsuit, I have very poor equity against most ranges. Even if they're stealing wide, I'm not in great shape.\n \nI see the button position offers some strategic flexibility. With a speculative hand like 6-5 offsuit, I could potentially call and see if I can outplay my opponent post-flop. However, the hand's inherent weakness makes this a risky proposition. The 3:1 pot odds are tempting, but my actual hand equity is likely much lower than the required 25%. \n\nThe short stack of my opponent adds another layer of complexity. Their raise might indicate strength or desperation, and I'm not convinced calling with such a marginal hand is the right move. I'll need to carefully weigh the potential risks against the limited upside of continuing with this hand.\n\nMy stack size gives me some breathing room, but that doesn't mean I should throw chips away on a weak holding. Folding seems like the most prudent decision here, preserving my chips for a better opportunity.",

This is a shove.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength**: A4o is a marginal hand, especially from SB\n2. **Pot odds**: I need to call 39 to win 47 (pot) + 39 (my call) = 86 chips. That's about 45% equity needed\n3. **Opponent's range**: Since this player has been very passive and now shoves, their range is likely strong. They could have: pairs (22+), strong Ax hands (A10+), broadway cards\n4. **Tournament situation**: I have a healthy stack of 62.5 BB. Risking 39 chips (15.6% of my stack) with A4o against a likely strong range is not ideal\n5. **Position**: I'll be out of position postflop if I call, but since opponent is all-in, there's no postflop play\n\nLet me calculate the equity of A4o against a typical shoving range:\n- Against a tight range (66+, AJs+, AQo+): ~30% equity\n- Against a wider range (22+, A2s+, KTs+, QJs, ATo+): ~38% equity\n\nGiven the pot odds require ~45% equity, and I'm likely behind their range, this is a fold.\n\nThe fact that this opponent has been very passive and suddenly shoves suggests real strength. They wouldn't do this lightly.\n\n**Decision**: Fold",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have Ac Tc - Ace-Ten suited in clubs. This is a decent hand, especially on the button. It's strong enough to play but not a premium hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position. I get to act last post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 raised to 8. Let me look at their history:\n   - They've been relatively tight, folding 7 times out of 20 actions shown\n   - When they do raise preflop (hand 19), it was a min-raise to 4\n   - They've shown willingness to bet post-flop but also fold when facing pressure\n   - In hand 22, they called preflop, bet on flop, then folded to a raise\n   - In hand 23, they called preflop, bet on flop, called a raise, then checked down\n\n4. **Stack Sizes**: \n   - I have 250 chips (62.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - MiniMax-M2 has 250 chips - same as me\n   - The raise is to 8, which is 2x the BB\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: Pot is 14, I need to call 8. That's about 1.75:1 pot odds, which is good for a suited Ace with position.\n\n6. **Tournament Consideration**: With a healthy stack of 62.5 BB, I can afford to see flops with speculative hands like ATs, especially in position.\n\nThe raise from MiniMax-M2 is relatively small (only 2x BB). Given their history of folding to pressure and their relatively tight play, I have a few options:\n\n- **Fold**: Too tight, ATs on button is definitely playable\n- **Call**: Reasonable, I get to see flop in position with a decent hand\n- **Raise**: Could be good to apply pressure, especially given opponent's tendency to fold to pressure\n\nGiven that I have position, a decent hand, and an opponent who seems to play straightforwardly and can fold to pressure, I think a call is the best option. I want to keep the pot small with ATs unless I hit the flop well. \n\nI could consider a 3-bet to apply pressure, but ATs plays better as a call in position where I can control the pot size and make decisions based on flop texture. The opponent's raise size is small enough that calling doesn't commit me too much.\n\nLet me make the call.",

I have 6 outs to top pair plus backdoor flush draw. MiniMax-M2 has shown tendency to bet flops but fold to raises (see hand 22). Good position on button allows me to take control of the hand.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: Tc Ac - I have Ace-Ten of clubs. This is a decent hand with a strong ace.\n2. **Position**: BTN (Button) - Good position, I act last post-flop.\n3. **Stack**: 242 chips (60.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n4. **Board**: 3s 6h Qc - The board is relatively dry with no flush draw (except my backdoor clubs) and no straight draws. There's a Q which is higher than my T.\n5. **Action**: Preflop - Seat 4 raised to 8, I called. Seat 4 then bet 12 on the flop.\n\nLet me analyze MiniMax-M2's tendencies from the data:\n- They raise preflop fairly often (hands 19, 22, 23, 26)\n- They frequently continuation bet on the flop (hands 16, 19, 22, 23, 26)\n- In hand 22, they bet 16 on flop then folded to a raise\n- In hand 23, they bet 8 on flop, called a raise, then checked turn and river\n\nSo MiniMax-M2 is aggressive preflop and on the flop, but can fold to pressure. Their flop bets vary in size.\n\n**Current situation**:\n- Pot: 34 chips\n- Bet to call: 12 chips\n- Pot odds: 34:12 or about 2.8:1\n- I have 2 overcards (A and T) to the board. If MiniMax has a Q, I'm behind. If they have a pocket pair like 99, JJ, etc., I'm also behind.\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (need two more clubs)\n- I have 6 outs to top pair (3 Aces, 3 Tens) = about 24% equity on the turn\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. My hand is marginal - just Ace-high with backdoor draws\n2. I'm in position which is good\n3. MiniMax is aggressive but can fold to pressure\n4. Pot odds are decent (need ~26% equity to call)\n5. I have tournament stack considerations - losing 12 chips won't hurt much\n\n\n6. I could raise as a semi-bluff, but that risks more chips\n\nI see a strategic opportunity here. With my position and the opponent's tendency to fold under pressure, a call makes the most sense. I'll keep the pot small while maintaining the chance to improve my hand. The backdoor flush draw adds a subtle potential for a stronger hand on later streets. Calling allows me to gather more information without committing too many chips prematurely.\n\nThe semi-bluff raise becomes an attractive option given my opponent's past behavior of folding to aggression. By raising, I can potentially win the pot immediately or set up a favorable situation on the turn. The key is applying pressure while keeping my risk manageable.\n\nMy stack size provides flexibility, and the 12-chip investment represents a calculated risk. The potential to take down the pot now or improve my hand makes this a strategic move worth considering.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: Tc Ac (Ace-Ten of clubs)\n- Position: BTN\n- My stack: 206 chips (51.5 BB)\n- Board: 3s 6h Qc 9s\n- Pot: 118 chips\n- Action: MiniMax-M2 bet 24 on turn\n- I need to call 24\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have Ace-high with a gutshot straight draw (need a Jack for straight)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (need another club)\n- On the flop, I raised MiniMax-M2's bet, showing strength\n- MiniMax-M2 called my flop raise and is now betting the turn\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (MiniMax-M2):**\nLooking at the opponent actions:\n- They frequently fold preflop (hands 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25)\n- When they do play, they tend to bet on flops (hands 16, 19, 22, 23)\n- They sometimes fold to pressure (hand 22 folded on flop)\n- They can call raises (hands 16, 23)\n- They check turns and rivers when called (hands 16, 23)\n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have Ace-high with some draws. Not a strong made hand.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position.\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 bet on flop, called my raise, and now bets turn. This suggests they have something - possibly top pair, two pair, or a strong draw.\n4. **Pot Odds**: Pot is 118, I need to call 24. That's about 4.9:1 pot odds. With my gutshot and backdoor flush, I have about 10% equity (4 outs for gutshot = ~8%, plus some backdoor equity). The pot odds are decent but not great.\n5. **Stack Preservation**: I have a healthy stack of 51.5 BB. I don't want to jeopardize it with a marginal hand.\n\n**Key Insight**: The fact that MiniMax-M2 called my flop raise and is now betting the turn suggests they have a decent hand. My Ace-high is likely behind. While I have some outs, I'm probably drawing to 4 outs (any Jack) for the straight. The backdoor flush is unlikely.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold. My hand is too weak, I'm likely behind, and I don't have enough equity to justify the call. Even though the pot odds are decent, I'm risking chips with a marginal hand against an opponent who has shown strength throughout the hand.\n\nLet me make the fold decision.",

It's not connected, not suited, and low cards. This is a clear fold in almost all situations, especially from early position.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - you have to act first postflop with 4-5 players still to act behind you. You have no information about their hands.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have a healthy stack of 51.5 BB, so no pressure to play marginal hands.\n\n4. **Opponents**: I should check if any opponents have shown particular patterns, but 85o is so weak it doesn't matter.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: Early in tournament, I should play tight from early position. Folding here preserves my stack for better spots.\n\nI don't even need to look up opponent actions - this is a trivial fold. 85o is in the bottom 15% of starting hands and should never be played from UTG in a standard tournament scenario.\n\nLet me make the fold decision.",

This suggests they are playing relatively tight.\n\nI'm on the Button with J9o (offsuit). This is a marginal hand but being on the Button gives me position advantage. \n\nCurrent situation:\n- I have 206 chips (51.5 BB)\n- Blinds are 2/4\n- Pot is 6 chips\n- I need to call 2 more chips to see the flop\n- The BB has been folding frequently\n\nWith J9o on the Button, I have:\n- Decent stealing opportunity given the tight BB\n- Position advantage post-flop\n- Good pot odds (calling 2 to win 6 = 3:1)\n- Hand has some playability (can hit straights, pairs)\n\nThe BB has folded 7 of last 9 preflop hands, so they're likely to fold again. If I just call, I let them see the flop cheaply. If I raise, I might take it down preflop or have initiative post-flop.\n\nMinimum raise is to 8 chips. This would be a 6 chip raise (putting in 8 total). Given the BB's tightness, a raise seems good here. I could also just call and see a cheap flop with position.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight pattern and my position, I think stealing the blinds here is a good play. A raise to 8 seems appropriate - it's not too big but puts pressure on the tight BB.\n\nLet me consider the alternatives:\n- Fold: Too weak with this hand on the Button against a tight BB\n- Call: Could work, but I lose initiative and let the BB see flop cheaply\n- Raise: Good for stealing, maintains initiative, leverages position\n\nI think raising to 8 is the best play.",

They only played hands 20-22, showing a strong hand at showdown (Ks As). Now they've 3-bet my min-raise to 24.\n\nI have J9o on the button. This is a marginal hand, especially against a tight player who is 3-betting. Let me analyze:\n\n1. Hand strength: J9o is a weak hand that plays poorly against a tight 3-betting range\n2. Position: I'm on the button which is good, but I'm out of position postflop if I call\n3. Opponent: Very tight player who folds a lot preflop. Their 3-bet likely represents a strong range (QQ+, AK, maybe JJ)\n4. Stack size: I have 200 chips, calling 16 more would leave me with 184. If I raise, minimum is 40 which would be a 4-bet\n5. Pot odds: I need to call 16 to win 32, getting 2:1 odds. Against a tight range, this is not enough\n\nJ9o is dominated by most of their 3-betting range. Even if I hit a J, I'm often dominated by AJ/KJ/QJ. If I hit a 9, same issue. The only good scenario is hitting two pair or a straight, which is unlikely.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature and my weak hand, this is a clear fold. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nThe minimum raise to 40 would be a 4-bet bluff, which is too aggressive against a tight player who is likely to have a real hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 8d Kh - King-high, offsuit, decent but not premium. K8o is a marginal hand.\n\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - Excellent position, last to act postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 200 chips (50 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Pot:** 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 206 chips - Has been relatively tight, folding many hands preflop. Did raise in hand #22 and #30.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 231 chips - Very tight, folding most preflop. Only called once in hand #27 then folded.\n\n**Observations:**\n- Both opponents have been playing tight, especially the BB\n- SB has shown some aggression with raises in hands #22 and #30\n- I have position advantage on both players\n- Pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1) which is not great for a marginal hand\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength:** K8o is marginal, dominated by better Kx hands\n2. **Position:** Excellent on the button\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** Both seem tight, making stealing profitable\n4. **Stack sizes:** Healthy, can afford to see a flop\n5. **Tournament:** Still early(ish) with 50BB stacks\n\nI should consider raising to steal the blinds from these tight players, especially with position. A standard raise would be 3x BB = 12 chips. However, calling is also reasonable given the position and the fact that I'm getting 1.5:1 on my money against potentially weak ranges.\n\nLet me think about the best play:\n- **Fold:** Too tight from the button with K8o against tight blinds\n- **Call:** Reasonable, see a flop in position, but K8o can be problematic\n- **Raise:** Good for stealing, puts pressure on tight players\n\nGiven that both opponents fold a lot preflop (especially the BB who has folded 8/10 recent hands), a raise seems profitable. I'll raise to 12 chips (3x BB) as a standard steal attempt.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking more carefully:\n- The SB has been more active with raises in hands #22 and #30\n- The BB is extremely tight, folding 9/10 recent hands\n- My hand K8o is weak but playable in position\n- If I raise and get called, I'll be out of position postflop (wait no, I'm on the button so I'll have position)\n\nActually, I have position on both players since I'm on the button. Let me recalculate:\n- Seat 1: Me (BTN) - position is last to act postflop\n- Seat 2: SB - acts first postflop\n- Seat 3: BB - acts second postflop\n\nSo I have position advantage on both players.\n\nGiven the tightness of both opponents, a raise seems like the best play. I'll make it 12 chips (3x BB) as a standard steal size.\n\nWait, let me think about the minimum raise amount. The minimum raise to is 8, which means I can raise to 8 total (adding 4 more chips). But a standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 12 chips total. Let me raise to 12.\n\nActually, looking at the data again, the SB has shown aggression. If I raise and the SB comes back with a re-raise, I should be prepared to fold K8o. But the likelihood of both players folding to a button raise given their tight stats is high enough to make this profitable.\n\nFinal decision: Raise to 12 chips as a steal attempt against two tight players.",

JTo (offsuit) is marginal, especially from CO position.\n\n2. **Stack size**: 206 chips (51.5 BB) - Healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n3. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 29 from UTG (since they posted no blinds, they're acting first). This is a significant raise of 7.25x the big blind from early position.\n\n4. **Position**: I'm in CO (Cutoff), which is good position, but there's still Button, SB, and BB to act after me.\n\n5. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B is out of chips (0), so they must be all-in or this is a mistake. Wait, let me re-read...\n\nActually, the player states show GPT-OSS-120B has 0 chips (out), but the action says they raised to 29. This doesn't make sense. Let me assume this means they had 0 chips at the start of this hand and went all-in for their remaining stack, which must have been at least 29.\n\nGiven the confusion about GPT-OSS-120B's stack, I should treat this as a standard raise to 29.\n\n**Analysis of the raise**: \n- 7.25x BB raise from early position suggests strength\n- From UTG, this typically means premium hands: AA, KK, QQ, AK, possibly JJ, TT, AQ\n\n**My hand vs. that range**: \n- JTo is way behind that range\n- Even if they're weaker, I'm dominated by AJ, KJ, QJ, JT\n- Only about 30-35% equity against a typical UTG raising range\n\n**Pot odds**: \n- Pot is 35, I need to call 29\n- Getting about 1.2:1, need ~45% equity to call\n- I don't have that with JTo\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have a healthy stack, no need to gamble\n- Better spots will come\n- Preserving chips is important\n\nI should fold this hand. It's not strong enough to call a large raise from early position, especially with players left to act behind me.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n**My Hand:** Jc Js (pocket jacks) - a strong starting hand\n**Position:** BTN (button) - best position\n**Stack:** 202 chips (50.5 BB) - healthy stack\n**Blinds:** 2/4\n**Pot:** 28 chips\n\n**Current action:**\n- Seat 4 (SB) posted 2\n- I (BB) posted 4\n- Seat 2 raised to 12\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 4 (SB) called 10 (to match the raise)\n\n**To call:** 8 chips (12 - 4 I already posted)\n**Minimum raise to:** 20 chips\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):**\n- Very tight preflop player - folded 5 hands in a row before hand #30\n- Hand #30: raised to 24\n- Hand #31: folded\n- Hand #32: called 29, then bet 45 on flop, then folded to a raise\n- Only showdown shown: Ks As (very strong hand)\n- This player seems tight-aggressive, only playing strong hands\n\n**Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2):**\n- More active preflop - multiple raises (12, 8, 16)\n- Called a raise in hand #32\n- Showdowns show strong hands: Qs Ks, Kh Kc, 6d 6c, Ad 5d\n- This player seems loose-aggressive, playing a wider range\n\n**Decision analysis:**\n\nI have pocket jacks on the button, which is a premium hand. I should definitely play this hand. The question is whether to call or raise.\n\n**Pot odds:** Calling 8 to win 28 = 3.5:1, which is very good.\n\n**Reasons to raise:**\n1. I have a premium hand (JJ)\n2. I'm in position (button)\n3. Seat 2's raise suggests strength, but Seat 4's call could be with a wide range\n4. I want to isolate or build a pot with my strong hand\n5. I don't want to give good odds to hands like AK, AQ to chase\n\n**Reasons to just call:**\n1. Seat 2 is tight and likely has a strong range (QQ+, AK maybe)\n2. Keep the pot smaller if an overcard comes\n3. Disguise hand strength\n\nHowever, with pocket jacks, I should be aggressive. The standard play is to 3-bet here. Given the action:\n- Seat 2 raised to 12 (3x BB)\n- Seat 4 called\n\nA good 3-bet size would be around 3x the original raise, so about 36-40 chips. Since minimum raise is 20, I can raise to 40 or even go higher.\n\nLet me consider stack sizes:\n- Seat 2 has 120 chips (30 BB) - relatively short\n- Seat 4 has 345 chips (86 BB) - deep stack\n- I have 202 chips (50 BB) - medium stack\n\nGiven Seat 2 is short-stacked and tight, if I raise and they shove, I'm likely flipping against AK/AQ or dominated against QQ+. But with JJ, I'm often ahead of their range.\n\nGiven Seat 4's loose nature, I want to charge them to see a flop.\n\nI think a raise to 40 chips (10x BB) is appropriate here. It's a standard 3-bet size and builds the pot with my premium hand while in position.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The pot is 28, and I need to call 8. If I raise to 40, that's a raise of 32. Given the action and stack sizes, I could also consider raising to 36 or 40.\n\nI'll raise to 40 chips. This is about 3x the original raise and puts pressure on both opponents.",

          "content": "  Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- I have Jc Js (pocket Jacks) on the BTN\n- My stack: 166 chips (41.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 172 chips\n- Amount to call: 80\n- Minimum raise to: 200\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Seat 4 posted SB 2\n- I posted BB 4\n- Seat 2 raised 12 (to 12 total)\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 4 called 10 (to 12 total)\n- I raised 40 (to 52 total)\n- Seat 2 raised 120 (to 172 total)\n- Seat 4 folded\n\nSo the action is back to me. I need to call 80 chips to see a pot of 172 + 80 = 252 chips.\n\n**Opponent analysis - Seat 2:**\nFrom the recall data, Seat 2 appears to be an aggressive player. Looking at their actions:\n- Hand 20: raised preflop to 6, called flop bet 8, called river bet 12 (won with Ks As)\n- Hand 21: called preflop 10, bet 24 on flop\n- Hand 22: raised preflop 12, raised flop 45\n- Hand 30: raised preflop 24\n- Hand 32: called preflop 29, bet 45 on flop, then folded\n\nThey seem to play aggressively with strong hands. The fact that they're willing to 4-bet to 172 chips suggests they have a very strong hand.\n\n**My hand strength:**\nPocket Jacks are strong but vulnerable to overcards. Against a 4-bet from an aggressive player, I'm likely facing:\n- Premium pairs (AA, KK, QQ)\n- AK (suited or offsuit)\n- Possibly AQ or TT\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Need to call 80 to win 252\n- Pot odds: 80/252 = 31.7%\n- I need ~32% equity to call\n\n**My stack:**\nI have 166 chips total. If I call 80, I'll have 86 chips left (21.5 BB). If I raise, minimum is 200 which puts me all-in.\n\nLet me think about the equity of JJ against a 4-betting range:\n- vs AA/KK: ~20% equity\n- vs QQ: ~45% equity\n- vs AK: ~55% equity\n- vs TT: ~80% equity\n\nIf Seat 2's 4-bet range is {AA, KK, QQ, AK}, my equity is roughly:\n- 3 combos each of AA/KK = 6 combos (20% equity)\n- 6 combos of QQ = 6 combos (45% equity)\n- 16 combos of AK = 16 combos (55% equity)\n\nWeighted equity: (6\u00d70.2 + 6\u00d70.45 + 16\u00d70.55) / 28 = (1.2 + 2.7 + 8.8) / 28 = 12.7/28 = 45.4%\n\nSo against that range, I have about 45% equity, which is better than the 32% I need.\n\nHowever, this is a tournament and stack preservation matters. If I call and lose, I'll be down to 86 chips. If I fold, I keep 166 chips.\n\nThe pot is already 172 and I need to call 80. This is a big pot relative to stacks. \n\nLooking at the action:\n- Seat 2 initial raise to 12 (3x BB)\n- I 3-bet to 40 (10x BB)\n- Seat 2 4-bets to 172 (43x BB)\n\nThis is a massive 4-bet, suggesting extreme strength. The fact that Seat 2 has only 12 chips left after this bet means they're essentially all-in.\n\nWait, let me check Seat 2's stack again. It says \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 12 chips\". So they raised 120, which would leave them with 12 chips. This means they're committed.\n\nGiven that this is essentially an all-in from Seat 2, and the pot is already so large, I need to decide if I want to commit with JJ.\n\nIn a tournament situation, with 41.5 BB, I should be careful about getting all-in preflop with JJ unless I'm confident my opponent is very wide. But the pot odds are compelling.\n\nLet me reconsider: I have to call 80 to win 252. That's 3.15:1 pot odds. I need 24% equity to break even. Even against {AA, KK, QQ}, I have about 33% equity ((6\u00d70"

I need to call 80 chips to see a pot of 172 + 80 = 252 chips.\n\n**Opponent analysis - Seat 2:**\nFrom the recall data, Seat 2 appears to be an aggressive player. Looking at their actions:\n- Hand 20: raised preflop to 6, called flop bet 8, called river bet 12 (won with Ks As)\n- Hand 21: called preflop 10, bet 24 on flop\n- Hand 22: raised preflop 12, raised flop 45\n- Hand 30: raised preflop 24\n- Hand 32: called preflop 29, bet 45 on flop, then folded\n\nThey seem to play aggressively with strong hands. The fact that they're willing to 4-bet to 172 chips suggests they have a very strong hand.\n\n**My hand strength:**\nPocket Jacks are strong but vulnerable to overcards. Against a 4-bet from an aggressive player, I'm likely facing:\n- Premium pairs (AA, KK, QQ)\n- AK (suited or offsuit)\n- Possibly AQ or TT\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Need to call 80 to win 252\n- Pot odds: 80/252 = 31.7%\n- I need ~32% equity to call\n\n**My stack:**\nI have 166 chips total. If I call 80, I'll have 86 chips left (21.5 BB). If I raise, minimum is 200 which puts me all-in.\n\nLet me think about the equity of JJ against a 4-betting range:\n- vs AA/KK: ~20% equity\n- vs QQ: ~45% equity\n- vs AK: ~55% equity\n- vs TT: ~80% equity\n\nIf Seat 2's 4-bet range is {AA, KK, QQ, AK}, my equity is roughly:\n- 3 combos each of AA/KK = 6 combos (20% equity)\n- 6 combos of QQ = 6 combos (45% equity)\n- 16 combos of AK = 16 combos (55% equity)\n\nWeighted equity: (6\u00d70.2 + 6\u00d70.45 + 16\u00d70.55) / 28 = (1.2 + 2.7 + 8.8) / 28 = 12.7/28 = 45.4%\n\nSo against that range, I have about 45% equity, which is better than the 32% I need.\n\nHowever, this is a tournament and stack preservation matters.

The fact that Seat 2 has only 12 chips left after this bet means they're essentially all-in.\n\nWait, let me check Seat 2's stack again. It says \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 12 chips\". So they raised 120, which would leave them with 12 chips. This means they're committed.\n\nGiven that this is essentially an all-in from Seat 2, and the pot is already so large, I need to decide if I want to commit with JJ.\n\nIn a tournament situation, with 41.5 BB, I should be careful about getting all-in preflop with JJ unless I'm confident my opponent is very wide. But the pot odds are compelling.\n\nLet me reconsider: I have to call 80 to win 252. That's 3.15:1 pot odds. I need 24% equity to break even.

I have a premium hand (JJ)\n4. Tournament life considerations - if I lose, I'm down to 86 chips\n\nI think calling is the right play. I can't raise because minimum raise is 200 and I only have 166 chips, so calling is my only option besides folding. I should not fold JJ getting these odds.\n\nLet me format the response correctly:",

I 3-bet to 40, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) 4-bet to 120, I called 80 more.\n- This suggests Seat 2 has a very strong hand (likely AA, KK, QQ, AK)\n- The flop is Ad 8d 7h - this is terrible for my pocket jacks! The Ace is on board.\n- Seat 2 only has 12 chips left (3 BB), I have them covered easily.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- My pocket jacks are now essentially a bluff catcher. Any Ace beats me, and there are straight draws (9-6, T-6, T-9) and flush draws.\n- Given the preflop action, Seat 2 very likely has an Ace (AA, AK, AQ, AJ) or a big pair (KK, QQ).\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nLooking at the recall data for Kimi-K2:\n- They were very active in hands 20-22 with multiple raises\n- Then went through a folding streak (hands 23-29) - very tight\n- Hand 30: raised 24\n- Hand 31: folded\n- Hand 32: called 29, then bet 45 on flop, then folded to a raise\n- They seem to be aggressive when they enter pots but have been folding a lot lately\n\n**Current Decision:**\n- I have the option to check or bet\n- Seat 2 only has 12 chips left (3 BB)\n- The pot is 252 chips\n- If I bet, I risk 12 chips to win 252 (21:1 odds)\n- My jacks are unlikely to be good here given the Ace on board and the preflop action\n\n**Recommendation:**\nI should check here. There's no value in betting - Seat 2 will only call with hands that beat me (any Ace, sets, two pairs). If they have a bluff or draw, they might shove their remaining 12 chips as a bluff, which I can call getting great odds. Checking gives them a chance to bluff with their short stack. Also, if they check behind, I get a free card to see if I improve.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. They only have 12 chips left. If I check, they can check behind and see a free card. If I bet, I force them to commit their last chips. \n\nGiven the preflop action (they 4-bet to 120), they almost certainly have:\n- AA: crushing me\n- KK: I'm behind but they might be worried about the Ace\n- QQ: I'm ahead but again, they might be worried about the Ace\n- AK: I'm crushed\n- AQ/AJ: I'm crushed\n\nSo I'm either way ahead (vs QQ/KK) or way behind (vs AA/AK/AQ/AJ). The problem is I don't know which.\n\nWith them having only 12 chips left, I think checking is better because:\n1. If they have QQ/KK, they might check behind fearing the Ace\n2. If they have nothing/air, they might bluff shove 12 chips which I can call\n3. If they have AA/AK/AQ, they might shove anyway and I can fold\n\nActually, wait - checking seems too passive. Let me think about the bet:\n- If I bet minimum (80), that's way too much relative to their stack\n- I could put them all-in for 12 more chips\n- If I bet 12 (all-in), I'm risking 12 to win 252 (21:1 odds)\n\nIf I bet 12:\n- They fold hands that don't have an Ace (KK, QQ, air) - I win 252\n- They call/shove with Ace hands - I lose 12\n\nGiven they 4-bet preflop, the chance they have an Ace is high. But 21:1 odds means I only need to be good ~4.8% of the time for a bet to be profitable.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the entire situation. I have Jc Js on an Ad 8d 7h board against an opponent who 4-bet preflop and now has 12 chips left.\n\nThe SPR (stack-to-pot ratio) is extremely low (12/252 = 0.05). This is a trivial all-in decision.\n\nI think betting is actually better because:\n1. I can fold out some hands that have equity against me (like KK, QQ that might hit"

Seat 2 raised, I re-raised, Seat 2 shoved (120 total), I called 80 more.\n- Flop: I checked, Seat 2 checked\n- Turn: It's on me to act\n\nSo this is heads-up between me (Seat 1) and Seat 2. Seat 2 has 12 chips left after the preflop action. Let me calculate:\n\nPreflop action details:\n- Seat 4 posted SB: 2\n- I posted BB: 4\n- Seat 2 raised to 12\n- Seat 4 called 10\n- I raised to 40\n- Seat 2 raised to 120 (all-in)\n- Seat 4 folded\n- I called 80 (putting in 120 total)\n\nSo going to flop:\n- Seat 2 put in 120 chips, so they started with 120+? Actually, they have 12 left now, so they started with 132 chips.\n- I put in 120 chips, so I have 86 left now, meaning I started with 206 chips.\n\nCurrent pot is 252 chips. Let me verify:\n- Preflop: SB (2) + BB (4) + Seat 2 (120) + Me (120) = 246\n- Actually, Seat 4 folded after calling 10, so their 10 is also in the pot.\n- So: 2 + 4 + 10 + 120 + 120 = 256... close enough, maybe some rounding.\n\nSeat 2 has 12 chips left and is all-in or will be all-in on the turn.\n\nThe board: Ad 8d 7h 4c\nMy hand: Jc Js\n\nSo I have pocket Jacks on a board with:\n- Ace of diamonds\n- 8 of diamonds\n- 7 of hearts\n- 4 of clubs\n\nThis is a scary board for pocket Jacks. The Ace is a major concern. There are also diamond draw possibilities and straight draw possibilities.\n\nLet me think about what Seat 2 could have:\nGiven the preflop action (raise, 4-bet, 5-bet all-in), they likely have:\n- Premium pairs: AA, KK, QQ, JJ (but I have JJ)\n- AK, AQ, maybe AQs\n- Maybe some bluffs\n\nThe flop was Ad 8d 7h and I checked, they checked. This is interesting. If they had an Ace, would they check? Maybe if they have AK, AQ, they might check to control pot size or induce a bet. If they have a pocket pair like KK or QQ, they might check on this Ace-high board.\n\nNow the turn is 4c, which doesn't change much. It might complete some straight draws (53 got there, but that's unlikely given preflop action).\n\nI have 86 chips left, Seat 2 has 12 chips left. If I bet, I can force them all-in. The pot is 252, and they only have 12 left.\n\nMy options:\n1. Check - let them see a free river card\n2. Bet - put them all-in\n\nGiven that they checked the flop, they might be weak. But there's also an Ace on board, which is scary for my Jacks.\n\nLet me think about pot odds. If I bet 12 to win 252, that's 21:1 pot odds for them. They'll call with almost anything.\n\nShould I bet or check?\n- If I'm ahead (they have something like KK, QQ, or a bluff), I should bet to get value and protect my hand\n- If I'm behind (they have Ax), I should check and see if I can get to showdown cheaply\n\nGiven the preflop aggression, Seat 2 could easily have:\n- AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, 99\n- AK, AQ\n- Some bluffs\n\nThe Ace on board hits a lot of their preflop range. But they checked the flop, which suggests they don't have a strong Ace, or they have a medium hand they're trying to showdown cheaply.\n\nWith only 12 chips left for them, I think I should bet and put them all-in. The pot is too big relative to their stack to give them a free card. Even if I'm behind, I might have outs (two Jacks left for a set), and sometimes they'll fold a small pocket pair or a bluff.\n\nActually,"

          "reasoning_content": "  The user is pointing out an error in my response. The minimum raise is 80, but I tried to raise to 12 (which is below the minimum). Let me recalculate:\n\nLooking at the hand setup again:\n- Amount to call: 0\n- Minimum raise to: 80\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\nSo if I want to raise, I need to raise to at least 80. But Seat 2 only has 12 chips left. So if I raise to 80, that's effectively going all-in myself.\n\nWait, let me think about this more carefully. If the minimum raise is 80 and Seat 2 only has 12 chips left, then:\n- If I raise to 80, I'm putting in 80 chips, but Seat 2 can only call 12\n- The raise would put me all-in (or close to it)\n\nActually, let me reconsider the entire hand situation:\n\nPot: 252 chips\nMy stack: 86 chips\nOpponent stack: 12 chips\nBoard: Ad 8d 7h 4c\nMy hand: Jc Js\n\nThe opponent checked the flop on an Ace-high board. They have 12 chips left.\n\nIf I check:\n- They get a free river card\n- We go to showdown with current board\n\nIf I bet/raise:\n- Minimum raise is 80, but I only have 86\n- I could go all-in for 86\n- They can only call 12, so they'd be all-in\n\nGiven the opponent has 12 chips left and the pot is 252 (21:1 pot odds for them), they will call with any hand they have. Checking gives them a free shot at beating me.\n\nWith pocket Jacks on an Ace-high board, I should protect my hand. Even though I might be behind to Ax, the opponent's check on the flop suggests weakness. They could have:\n- KK, QQ, JJ that checked scared of the Ace\n- A draw that checked\n- A weak Ace that checked\n\nI think the right play is to bet/raise and put them all-in rather than give a free card. Since minimum raise is 80 and I have 86, I should go all-in.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. Since the amount to call is 0, I can check. If I want to bet, I need to raise to at least 80. But since opponent only has 12, raising to 80 is effectively the same as going all-in for 86.\n\nLet me reconsider: With pocket Jacks on this board, facing an opponent who has shown weakness by checking the flop, and with them having only 12 chips left, I think betting to put them all-in is correct. The Ace is scary, but their check suggests they don't have a strong Ace.\n\nI'll go all-in for my remaining 86 chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the Button with 8d 8c (pocket eights)\n- My stack: 336 chips (84 BB)\n- Only opponent: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) in BB with 8 chips\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- I need to call 2 more chips to see the flop\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at Seat 2's recent actions:\n- Hand 29: Preflop fold\n- Hand 30: Preflop raise to 24 chips (very large raise)\n- Hand 31: Preflop fold  \n- Hand 32: Called 29, then bet 45 on flop, then folded\n- Hand 33: Raised to 12 preflop, then raised to 120 (all-in), checked flop, folded turn\n\nThis player seems aggressive and willing to play big pots. They went all-in in hand 33. They're currently very short-stacked with only 8 chips (2 BB).\n\n**Hand strength:**\n8-8 is a decent hand, especially heads-up. Against a random hand, 8-8 has about 70% equity. Against a short-stacked opponent, this is a very strong hand.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm on the Button, which is great position post-flop (though position matters less when opponent is all-in).\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- I have 336 chips (84 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent has only 8 chips (2 BB) - extremely short\n- This is a tournament, so eliminating opponents is valuable\n\n**Decision:**\nWith pocket 8s on the Button against a player who is down to just 8 chips (2 BB), this is a clear raise situation. The opponent is likely to call with a very wide range given their desperation stack size. I want to get value and potentially eliminate them.\n\nThe minimum raise is to 8 chips, but given the opponent only has 8 chips total, I should just raise to put them all-in. This would be a raise to 10 (2 to call + 8 more = total of 10), but since they only have 8 chips, I can just raise to 8 and they'll be all-in for their remaining 6 chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: The pot is 6 (2+4), I posted the SB of 2. To call I need to put in 2 more. If I raise to 8 total, that means I'm putting in 6 more than the call amount. The opponent has 8 chips total and has put in 4 as BB, so they have 4 left. So if I raise to 8, they would need to call 4 more to match (they already put in 4 as BB, so 8 total means 4 more).\n\nSince they only have 8 chips total and 4 are already in the pot, they have 4 left. So raising to 8 puts them all-in.\n\nWith pocket 8s, I'm happy to get it in against a random hand from a desperate short stack. This is a +EV play that also has tournament equity benefits by potentially eliminating an opponent.\n\nI'll raise to put pressure and get value. Since the minimum raise is 8 and that puts them all-in, that's the right amount.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n**My hand:** 3h 4d (very weak offsuit connector)\n**Position:** BTN (good position)\n**Stack:** 342 chips (85.5 BB) - healthy stack\n**Blinds:** 2/4 (very small relative to stack)\n\n**Pot:** 6 chips (1.5 BB)\n**To call:** 4 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - only has 6 chips left (very short stack)\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - has 225 chips\n\nLooking at the opponent data:\n\n**Seat 2 (SB) - Kimi-K2:**\n- Very short stack (6 chips, which is 1.5 BB)\n- Recent action shows they folded many hands preflop (hands 23-29, 31, 34)\n- They did raise in hand 30 (amount 24), hand 33 (amount 12 then 120)\n- In hand 32 they called 29 preflop\n- Their stack is so short they'll be forced all-in soon\n\n**Seat 3 (BB) - DeepSeek-V3.2:**\n- Very tight player - folded preflop in 15 of the last 20 hands shown\n- Only played hand 23 (raised preflop, raised flop, then checked turn/river)\n- Only other actions were calling 2 chips in hand 27 then folding\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 3h 4d is extremely weak. This is a fold in almost all situations.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the button which is good, but with such a weak hand it doesn't matter much.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:**\n   - SB is super short stacked (6 chips). They'll likely be all-in on the flop regardless. \n   - BB is extremely tight, folding most hands preflop.\n   \n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1 pot odds). This is not relevant with such a weak hand.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** \n   - I have a healthy stack (85.5 BB)\n   - The SB has only 1.5 BB left and will be forced all-in soon anyway\n   - There's no need to risk chips with such a weak hand\n   - Even if I call and the tight BB folds, I'm just gambling against the short stack\n   - If I call and BB raises, I'd have to fold anyway\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. 3-4 offsuit has very little equity even against random hands. With my healthy stack, I should wait for a better spot. The short stack in SB will likely bust soon anyway, and there's no need to donate chips with garbage.\n\nIf I were to call, I'd be putting in 4 chips (1% of my stack) to potentially win 10 chips, but with a hand that will hit a strong hand only rarely. It's not worth it.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: 6d 7h (suited connector, but offsuit - so 67o)\n**Position**: SB (small blind)\n**Stack**: 342 chips (85.5 BB)\n**Current situation**: \n- Blinds are 2/4\n- Pot: 10 chips (2 from SB, 4 from BB, 4 from MiniMax-M2 call)\n- I need to call 2 more to see the flop\n- MiniMax-M2 has called from late position (seat 4)\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Hand 31: preflop fold\n- Hand 32: preflop call 25, flop check, flop raise 90\n- Hand 33: preflop call 10, then fold\n- Hand 34: preflop fold\n- Hand 35: preflop fold\n- Hand 36: preflop call 8\n- Hand 37: preflop fold\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems to be playing relatively tight but does call sometimes. They called in hand 32 with a significant amount (25), then made a big raise on the flop (90). This suggests they can have strong hands but also might be aggressive post-flop.\n\n**Hand strength**: 67o is a weak hand. It's not suited, doesn't have high card value, and is easily dominated. In SB, I'm out of position against both BB and MiniMax-M2.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 2 to win a pot of 10, so 5:1 pot odds. This is attractive, but with such a weak hand and being out of position, this is not a good spot.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 85.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots like this. The risk/reward isn't worth it, especially out of position with a weak hand.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. 67o is too weak to play from SB out of position, even with good pot odds. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

They seem very conservative.\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is in BB with 347 chips - This player defends their blind sometimes (called in hands 33, 36, 38) but also folds. They seem to defend with decent hands.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 4 to win 6, getting 1.5:1 odds.

This is definitely a raising hand.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in BB, which is out of position postflop, which is a slight disadvantage but manageable.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nThere's 10 chips in the pot (2 from SB + 4 from BB + 4 from limper). Since it's checked to me, I can check and see a free flop, or I can raise to take control.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. KQ is too strong to just check here\n2. The opponent is very tight/passive - likely has a weak/marginal hand\n3. I have position disadvantage, so I want to take control now\n4. Raising will likely fold out their weak hands and build the pot when I likely have the best hand\n5. Minimum raise is to 8 chips (4 more chips)\n\nI should raise here. A standard raise would be 3-4x the limp, so 12-16 chips total. Since minimum is 8, I should raise to at least 12 to get value and apply pressure.\n\nLet me raise to 12 chips (3x the limp).",

I have K-Q on a J-T-2 board, so any Ace or 9 gives me a straight.\n- 8 outs to the straight (4 Aces + 4 Nines)\n- This is about 16% equity on the turn (8/47), or about 31% by the river\n- I also have a backdoor flush draw with Qh (need running hearts)\n\n**Opponent tendencies from the data:**\nSeat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has been very passive:\n- They fold preflop a lot (hands 32-37)\n- When they do play, they check-call a lot (hand 38, 39)\n- They called a turn bet in hand 39\n- In hand 38 they had K-7 and checked down on A-J-5-6-8 board (missed straight draw?)\n- In hand 39 they had 6-4 and hit two pair on 9-3-4-2-6 board\n\nThis opponent seems passive, calling station tendencies. They call preflop, then check-call down.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 26, I can check for free. If I bet, minimum raise is 8.\n\n**Decision:**\nI have a strong draw with 8 outs to the nuts (straight). I should bet for value and to build the pot when I hit. I can also get folds from weaker hands.\n\nGiven the opponent's passive tendencies, they're likely to call with any pair or draw.

Ace-high has good showdown value.\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is a huge advantage.\n3. **Pot odds:** I need to call 4 to win 12 (3:1 pot odds). This is very favorable.\n4. **Opponent tendency:** DeepSeek is passive, which means I can likely steal pots postflop with aggression.\n5. **Stack preservation:** With 44 BB, I can afford to see flops and play poker.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold:** Too tight. I have a decent hand in great position with good pot odds.\n- **Call:** Reasonable. Cheap price to see flop with position.\n- **Raise:** Also reasonable. I could raise to 16 to try to take it down now or build pot when I have position.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have position\n- My hand has decent equity\n- Pot odds are great (3:1)\n- Opponent is passive\n- I can play well postflop from the button\n\nI think calling is the best play. Raising is also fine but might fold out worse hands that I want to keep in. I want to see a cheap flop in position with a hand that can make strong pairs and has decent showdown value.\n\nThe call costs me only 4 more chips (0.5 BB) which is a very small investment relative to my stack and the pot size.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My cards**: As 9c (Ace of spades, 9 of clubs) - This is a decent but marginal hand. Ace-high with a weak kicker.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Best position post-flop, but we're still preflop.\n\n**Stack**: 348 chips (43.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- I posted SB (4) and then called the BB (4 more = 8 total)\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 24 (3x)\n\n**To call**: 16 more chips (24 - 8 = 16)\n\n**Pot odds**: 32 + 16 = 48 in pot, need to call 16 = 3:1 pot odds\n\n**Opponent info**: DeepSeek-V3.2 has 201 chips (25 BB) - they're the short stack at the table.\n\nLooking at their history:\n- Hand 38: Checked turn and river (passive)\n- Hand 39: Called preflop, checked flop and turn, called turn bet, checked river (passive/trappy)\n- Hand 40: Called preflop twice (called a raise), then folded on flop (somewhat loose preflop but can fold)\n\nThis player seems somewhat passive and willing to call preflop, but can fold post-flop.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: A9o is marginal, especially with a 9 kicker. It's dominated by better aces (AT+, AJ+, AQ+, AK) and pairs.\n2. **Position**: Good position, but we need to see a flop to realize our equity.\n3. **Pot odds**: Getting 3:1 which is decent, but...\n4. **Stack sizes**: If I call 16, pot will be 48. If I hit an Ace on flop, I could be dominated. If I hit my 9, I might have best hand but it's vulnerable.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. Calling here with a marginal hand OOP (well, I'm on button but I'd be calling a raise) against a short stack who might be looking to get it in.\n\nThe raise size is 3x (24 from 8) which is standard. Given that DeepSeek-V3.2 is the short stack and has shown they can call preflop and fold postflop, I could call and try to outplay them post-flop in position.\n\nHowever, A9o is really at the bottom of my calling range here. The 16 chips represents about 4.6% of my stack. If I call and miss the flop (which will happen most of the time), I'll likely have to fold to any continuation bet.\n\nLet me think about the math: I need roughly 25% equity to call getting 3:1. Against a typical raising range (22+, AT+, KJ+, QJ+, suited connectors), A9o has about 30-35% equity. So mathematically it's a call.\n\nBut tournament poker is about more than just raw equity. It's about chip preservation and avoiding marginal spots. With a healthy stack, I don't need to take this marginal spot. I can find better spots.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. While the pot odds are decent and I have position, A9o is too marginal against a short stack's raise. I preserve my chips for better spots and avoid being dominated when I hit an Ace.",

I get to act last postflop.\n\n3. **Stack**: 348 chips (43.5 BB) - This is a healthy stack, but not deep stacked. I have room to play but need to be careful.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (SB): 229 chips, has been calling and checking a lot, but made a preflop raise in hand 41\n   - MiniMax-M2 (BB): 333 chips, has been folding a lot preflop lately (folded hand 40 and 41), but bets when they see favorable situations\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to win 12 chips (1.5:1). This is not great pot odds for a speculative hand.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 43.5 BB, I'm in decent shape. I don't need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands.\n\nLet me think about the opponent tendencies:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 seems passive, calling and checking a lot, but capable of raising\n- MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot preflop recently but bets postflop when involved\n\nWith 65s on the button, this is a marginal spot. The hand has potential but:\n- It's a low suited connector\n- I'm getting poor pot odds (1.5:1)\n- While I'm in position, if I call, I'll likely be heads-up against the BB\n- My stack is healthy enough that I don't need to gamble\n\nThe raise option: I could raise to try to steal the blinds, but:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot, so a steal might work\n- However, if I get called, I'm out of position postflop with a marginal hand\n- A standard raise would be to 16-24 chips, which is 2-3 BB\n\n\n- This represents a significant portion of my stack for a speculative hand\n\nI see multiple compelling reasons to fold. The pot odds are unfavorable, and the hand's potential doesn't justify the risk. With a decent stack and better opportunities ahead, folding seems the most prudent choice. The speculative nature of the hand, combined with the risk of committing chips, makes folding the clear strategic decision.",

They called in hands #39 and #40. They seem somewhat active but not overly aggressive. Their showdown hands have been weak (6h4h, 9cJc, 7sKh, 3dAs).\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): They've been more passive, with lots of checking and folding preflop. They called here which suggests they have something, but their range is likely wide given they've shown down hands like 3h4h, Kd6s, Ad5d, JsQc, 6d6c.\n\n6. **Stack sizes**: I have 340 chips (42.5 BB), so I'm healthy. No need to take marginal spots.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: While I could defend my blind with a suited hand, J4s is just too weak. I'm out of position against two players, and the raise sizing is significant (3x).\n\nThe key factors against calling:\n- Very weak hand (J4s)\n- Facing a raise AND a call (two players showing strength)\n- Would be out of position post-flop\n- No need to take marginal spots with a healthy stack\n\n\n- Poor pot odds compound the unfavorable situation, making a fold the clear strategic choice.\n\nThe decision is straightforward: fold this weak hand and wait for a better opportunity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my memory search results for DeepSeek-V3.2, I can see:\n\n**DeepSeek-V3.2's tendencies:**\n- Very tight/aggressive preflop: Has raised to 24 chips (3x BB) in hands #41 and #43\n- When they raise preflop, they often fold to flop aggression (hand #40, #43)\n- Generally passive postflop: Lots of checking and calling, minimal aggression\n- They do call sometimes (hand #39 called turn bet of 4)\n- Stack size: 197 chips (24.6 BB) - medium stack\n\n**My situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with Ah Ts (ace-ten suited)\n- I have 336 chips (42 BB) - healthy stack\n- It's 4 chips to call (half a BB)\n- I can raise to 16 chips minimum\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Ah Ts is a strong hand on the button, especially suited. Good for stealing, can flop strong top pairs, flush draws, straight draws.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button - best position postflop.\n\n3. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 is in the BB. They've shown a pattern of raising preflop with strong hands, and folding to aggression postflop. They're not overly aggressive postflop.\n\n4. **Action**: MiniMax-M2 folded. It's just me vs DeepSeek-V3.2 in the BB.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: 4 chips to win 12 chips = 3:1 odds. Easy call mathematically.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (42 BB). I can afford to see flops and play poker. Stealing blinds is valuable as blinds increase.\n\n**Decision**: \n- Just calling is too passive with this hand and position\n- Raising to 16 (2x BB) is a standard steal attempt\n- Given DeepSeek-V3.2's tendency to raise preflop with strong hands but fold to postflop pressure, a raise here is good\n- If they call, I have position and can control the pot\n- If they fold, I win the 12 chip pot immediately\n\nI should raise to 16 chips as a standard button steal with a decent hand. This is a good spot to accumulate chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The flop is Qc Kd 5c. I have Ah Ts.\n\nLet me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Strength**: I have Ace-high with a gutshot straight draw (need a J to make a straight). The board shows Qc Kd 5c, so there's a potential flush draw. I have no pair, no flush draw (only one club), but I do have a gutshot to the nuts (if a J comes, I'd have Broadway straight A-K-Q-J-T).\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button, which is good position. I raised preflop and got called by the BB.\n\n**Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 called my preflop raise. Looking at their history:\n- They fold often preflop (hands 34-37 all folded)\n- They sometimes call and then check-fold on flop (hand 40)\n- They sometimes raise preflop (hands 41, 43) and then fold on flop\n- They seem somewhat passive postflop\n\n**Pot**: 32 chips\n**My stack**: 324 chips (40.5 BB)\n**Amount to call**: 0 (I can check)\n**Legal actions**: fold, check, raise\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. I have a weak hand currently (Ace-high)\n2. I have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs: any Jack) - about 16% chance to hit on turn\n3. There's a flush draw on board which could be scary\n4. I'm in position\n5. My opponent seems passive and has shown tendency to fold to aggression\n\n**Decision**: I should check here. \n- My hand is too weak to bet for value\n- I could consider a continuation bet as a bluff, but with two high cards on board (Q,K), my opponent likely has some piece of it\n- Checking allows me to see a free card and potentially realize my equity if a J comes\n- If I bet and get called, I'm in trouble with Ace-high\n- The pot is small, so there's no urgency to win it right now\n\nI should check and see the turn card. If I hit my Jack, I'll have the nuts and can extract value. If not, I can evaluate based on opponent's action.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My hand: Ah Ts (Ace of hearts, Ten of spades)\n- Position: Button (BTN)\n- Stack: 324 chips (40.5 BB)\n- Board: Qc Kd 5c 9s\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- I have Ah Ts\n- Turn card is 9s\n- Action is on me\n\n**Hand strength:**\n- I have Ace-high with a gutshot straight draw (J would give me a straight)\n- Board shows Qc Kd 5c 9s\n- I need a Jack to make a straight (KQJT9)\n- I also have a backdoor flush draw with hearts, but it's weak since I only have one heart\n- Currently I just have Ace-high\n\n**Position and action:**\n- I'm on the Button, which is good position\n- Preflop: I raised to 16, DeepSeek-V3.2 called 8 from BB\n- Flop: Qc Kd 5c - I checked, opponent checked\n- Turn: 9s - action is on me\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at DeepSeek-V3.2's history:\n- They fold a lot preflop (hands 34-37, 42)\n- When they do play, they sometimes check-call (hand 39)\n- They sometimes raise preflop (hands 41, 43)\n- They folded to a flop bet in hand 43 after raising preflop\n- They seem somewhat passive postflop, checking often\n\n**Pot odds and situation:**\n- Pot is 32 chips\n- I can check for free\n- Minimum raise is to 8 (total, not additional)\n- My stack is healthy at 40.5 BB\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- We're in a tournament, so chip preservation matters\n- I have a decent stack, not desperate\n- DeepSeek has 189 chips (23.6 BB)\n\n**Decision analysis:**\nThe board is Qc Kd 5c 9s. I have Ah Ts.\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (need a Jack)\n- I have Ace-high\n- The board has potential flush and straight draws\n- Opponent checked twice (flop and turn hasn't acted yet)\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have position\n2. Opponent has been passive (checking a lot)\n3. I have some equity with the gutshot\n4. I can represent a strong hand (K, Q, or straight draw)\n5. Checking gives a free card to complete my straight\n\nI think a small bet here is good to:\n- Take down the pot now\n- Build the pot if I hit my straight on river\n- Charge opponent if they're drawing\n- Represent strength\n\nA bet of 16-24 chips seems appropriate (half to 3/4 pot). The minimum raise is to 8, but that's too small. I should bet more like 16-20.\n\nLet me check what I can raise to: minimum raise to 8, but I can raise more. A standard bet would be 16-24 (half pot to 3/4 pot).\n\nI think betting 16 is a good size - it's half pot, shows strength, and doesn't risk too many chips.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. I have Ace-high with a gutshot. The opponent has checked twice. They could have:\n- A weak pair\n- A draw\n- Nothing\n\nIf I bet and they call, I'm in trouble on the river unless I hit my Jack. If I check, I get a free card to hit my 4-outer (approximately 8.5% chance).\n\nBut checking also gives them a free card if they're drawing. However, they've shown passivity.\n\nGiven my opponent's passivity, a small bet might take it down. But checking is also fine to see a free card.\n\nI think checking is the safer play here. I don't have a strong made hand, and while I have some equity, I don't want to build a big pot with just Ace-high. I can check and see the river for free, and if I hit my Jack, I'll have a strong hand. If not, I can decide based on opponent's action.\n\nLet me check: the action is on me, amount to call is 0, so I can check.\n\nI'll check.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**My hand**: Ah Ts (Ace of hearts, Ten of spades)\n**Board**: Qc Kd 5c 9s Jc (Queen, King, Five, Nine, Jack - all clubs except King and Nine)\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: I have Ace-high. The board shows a straight draw possibility (10-Q-K-J-9 = I have 10) and a flush draw (4 clubs on board). Let me check what I actually have:\n   - Straight: I have 10, board has Q-K-J-9 = I have 10,9,J,Q,K = STRAIGHT! Wait, let me recount: 9s, Jc, Qc, Kd - that's 9-10-J-Q-K = STRAIGHT!\n   - Flush: 4 clubs on board (Qc, 5c, Jc, and I need to check if there's another... wait: Qc, 5c, Jc... that's only 3 clubs. Let me recount the board: Qc, Kd, 5c, 9s, Jc. That's 3 clubs (Qc, 5c, Jc). So no flush on board.\n   \n   So I have a straight: 9-10-J-Q-K! That's a very strong hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is good position.\n\n3. **Action**: Preflop I raised, opponent called. Flop: check-check. Turn: check-check. So opponent has shown no aggression.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's history, they tend to:\n   - Fold preflop often (hands 34-37 all folded)\n   - When they do play, they check frequently (hand 38 checked all streets)\n   - They called a turn bet in hand 39\n   - They folded to a flop bet in hand 40\n   - They raised preflop in hands 41 and 43 but folded on flop in hand 43\n   \n   This suggests they're cautious post-flop, often giving up when faced with aggression.\n\n5. **Pot size**: 32 chips. My stack is 324 chips (40.5 BB). This is a relatively small pot.\n\n6. **River situation**: No one has bet the river yet. I have a strong hand (straight). The opponent has checked to me twice (flop and turn), showing weakness.\n\n**Decision**: With a straight, I should definitely bet for value. The question is how much. Given the opponent's tendency to be cautious and fold to aggression, and the fact that they've shown no strength, I should make a value bet that they might call with weaker hands.\n\nGiven the pot is 32, a bet of around 1/2 to 3/4 pot (16-24 chips) seems appropriate. The minimum raise is 8, but I want to bet, not raise. Since the amount to call is 0, I can \"check\" or \"raise\". To bet, I need to use \"raise\" action.\n\nLet me bet 24 chips (3/4 pot) to extract value from hands like two pair, sets, or possibly weaker straights if they have something.",

Showed down weak hands like 6h4h, 7sKh. Seems somewhat loose/passive.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): More conservative - frequently folds preflop, occasionally calls. Showed down decent hands like 6d6c, Ad5d, JsQc. Seems tighter.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: K9s is a decent but marginal hand. It's suited and has a King, but the kicker is weak.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is huge advantage - I get to act last postflop.\n3. **Stack Size**: 44.5 BB is comfortable but not deep enough to play too loosely.\n4. **Opponents**: Facing SB and BB only. Both seem beatable.\n5. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 8 to win 12 (1.5:1) - not great immediate odds, but position and implied odds help.\n\n**Decision Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight from the button with a suited hand. We're not that short-stacked.\n- **Call**: Reasonable. We have position, suited hand, and both opponents seem beatable. Good implied odds if we hit.\n- **Raise**: Could steal the blinds, but with 44.5 BB, we don't need to be desperate. K9s plays better as a call than a raise.\n\nI think calling is the best play. We want to see a flop in position with a hand that can make strong hands (flush, top pair, straight draws). We're not deep enough to be super speculative, but with position and the right opponents, calling is +EV.\n\nLet me make the call.",

The board has a Queen, so anyone with a Queen beats me. There's also a heart flush draw, which could be dangerous if my opponent has two hearts.\n\n2. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n   - They check a lot (hands 38, 39)\n   - They sometimes bet small amounts (hand 39: bet 4 on turn, hand 43: bet 16 on flop)\n   - They made a big raise once (hand 32: raise 90 on flop)\n   - Generally seems to play somewhat passively\n\n3. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is great.

The board has:\n- A higher card (Queen) that could beat me\n- A flush draw (hearts)\n- The opponent checked\n\nI think checking is the best option here. I could consider a small value bet, but:\n1. I don't know if I'm ahead - they could have a Queen, a higher pocket pair, or be slow-playing something\n2. If I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot\n3. If they have a flush draw, I want to keep the pot small\n4. I can control the pot size and see the turn for free\n\nChecking allows me to:\n- See the turn card for free\n- Potentially induce a bluff on the turn\n- Avoid building a big pot with a marginal hand\n- Preserve my stack\n\nI don't think this is a good spot to bet for value.

There's also a heart flush draw, which could be dangerous if my opponent has two hearts.\n\n2. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n   - They check a lot (hands 38, 39)\n   - They sometimes bet small amounts (hand 39: bet 4 on turn, hand 43: bet 16 on flop)\n   - They made a big raise once (hand 32: raise 90 on flop)\n   - Generally seems to play somewhat passively\n\n3. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is great. I get to act last and see what they do.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 20, I can check for free.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. I should be looking to accumulate chips but also avoid big risks.\n\n**Decision**: \n\nI have middle pair which is vulnerable. The board has:\n- A higher card (Queen) that could beat me\n- A flush draw (hearts)\n- The opponent checked\n\nI think checking is the best option here. I could consider a small value bet, but:\n1. I don't know if I'm ahead - they could have a Queen, a higher pocket pair, or be slow-playing something\n2. If I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot\n3. If they have a flush draw, I want to keep the pot small\n4. I can control the pot size and see the turn for free\n\nChecking allows me to:\n- See the turn card for free\n- Potentially induce a bluff on the turn\n- Avoid building a big pot with a marginal hand\n- Preserve my stack\n\nI don't think this is a good spot to bet for value. My hand is too vulnerable and there are too many bad turn cards (any Queen, any heart, any card higher than 9).\n\n**Action**: Check <|tool_calls_section_begin|> <|tool_call_begin|> functions.recall_my_hands:1 <|tool_call_argument_begin|> {\"limit\": 5} <|tool_call_end|> <|tool_calls_section_end|>",

This is a paired board (Queens). I have second pair (9s) with a King kicker.\n\n**Hand strength analysis**:\n- I have second pair on a paired board\n- There's a possible flush draw (hearts) out there\n- There's also a possible straight draw (if someone has KJ or JT, but unlikely given the board)\n- My hand is marginal at best\n\n**Position and stack considerations**:\n- I have position (good)\n- I have 348 chips (43.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot is only 20 chips - not huge\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. I have a marginal hand with some showdown value\n2. The opponent has been passive and checked twice (flop and turn)\n3. There's a possible flush draw that could be out there\n4. I'm in position and can control the pot size\n5. If I bet, I might fold out worse hands and get called by better hands\n6. If I check, I get a free river card and can evaluate again\n\nGiven that the opponent has shown passivity and checked twice, and I have a marginal hand with some showdown value, checking seems like the best option. I don't want to build a big pot with second pair on a paired board, and I can get to showdown cheaply or possibly extract value on the river if checked to again.\n\nHowever, I could also consider a small value bet to extract value from worse hands like pocket pairs below 9s, or Ace-high hands. But the risk is that I'm turning my hand into a bluff and might get called by better hands.\n\nI think checking is the safer, more optimal play here given the board texture and opponent's passivity.",

However, they could be:\n- Slowplaying a monster (full house, trips)\n- Have a weak Qx and checking for showdown\n- Have a missed draw and giving up\n- Have a medium strength hand like 9x, 4x, or pocket pair below Q\n\nGiven the board texture and passive action, I should consider:\n\n\nI'll need to carefully evaluate the betting strategy. The pot is relatively small at 20 chips, which suggests a cautious approach might be wise. With my two pair, I'm in a decent position, but the potential for stronger hands exists. The key is to extract value without risking too many chips.\n\nChecking seems like the most prudent move. This allows me to control the pot size and potentially induce a bluff or weaker hand to show down. The passive action throughout the hand indicates my opponent might have a marginal holding, making a check the safest play.\n\nI'll focus on protecting my stack and avoiding unnecessary risks in this tournament scenario. A check keeps the pot manageable and prevents potential chip loss against a stronger range.",

In hand 43 they called preflop and bet on the flop. They're not super aggressive.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. Hand strength: 7-3 offsuit is in the bottom 10% of starting hands. Very weak.\n2. Position: Out of position makes everything worse\n3. Pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 20, so 5:1 pot odds. This might seem tempting but...\n4. Reverse implied odds: With such a weak hand, if I hit something like a 7, I could lose a lot more chips when dominated by better 7s\n5. Tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, no need to gamble with trash. Better spots will come.\n\nEven though the pot odds are decent (5:1), this hand is simply too weak to play from the SB, especially out of position. The risk of getting into trouble postflop far outweighs the potential reward. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. I need to call 4 chips to see the flop. The pot is 20 chips. That's 5:1 pot odds. With any two cards, sometimes you might consider it. But 7-3 offsuit is just so bad, and I'll be out of position. Even if I hit a 7, I could be dominated. If I hit two pair, someone could have a straight. It's just not worth it.\n\nThe correct play is to fold. Save the 4 chips and wait for a better hand and/or better position.",

Q6o is generally not a profitable hand to play.\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop\n- Only 2 active opponents: SB (Seat 3) and BB (Seat 4)\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- My stack: 368 chips (46 BB) - healthy stack\n- SB (DeepSeek-V3.2): 193 chips (24 BB) - short stack\n- BB (MiniMax-M2): 349 chips (43.6 BB) - similar to mine\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n\n**DeepSeek-V3.2 (SB):**\n- Has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 42, 45, 46)\n- Made raises in hands 43 (24 chips) and 47 (28 chips)\n- When they call, they tend to play passively post-flop (check-fold in hand 44)\n- Seems to have a tight-aggressive style but folds frequently\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (BB):**\n- More calling station tendencies (called 20 in hand 43, called 8 in hand 47)\n- Defends BB by calling\n- Can be passive post-flop (lots of checking in hand 45)\n- Showdown hands suggest they play a wide range (Ad5d, JsQc, 3h4h, Kd6s)\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 12 chips\n- Need to call 8 chips\n- Getting 1.5:1 odds\n- This is not good enough for Q6o\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 46 BB\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Q6o is a fold in most situations\n- Even with position advantage, this hand doesn't have enough equity\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite being on the Button, Q6o is simply too weak to play profitably here. The opponents don't have extreme tendencies that would make me want to steal with such a weak hand. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nThe only argument for playing would be if both opponents were extremely tight and I could steal the blinds frequently, but the data shows MiniMax-M2 defends their BB, and DeepSeek-V3.2 does occasionally raise.",

In hand 43 they raised to 24 then folded on flop. Seems somewhat aggressive but can fold.\n- **MiniMax-M2**: More passive - lots of checking, some folding. Called in hand 43 then bet on flop. In hand 47 called 8 then folded. Now they're re-raising which is unusual for them.\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm out of position as BB\n- Both opponents have position on me post-flop\n- I have a healthy stack at 45 BB\n- Tournament considerations: I should preserve my stack and not get involved in marginal spots\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. K4o is trash, I'm out of position, facing a 3-bet from a normally passive player (MiniMax-M2), and I'd be investing 24 chips (6% of my stack) into a pot where I'm likely dominated. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify calling with such a weak hand.\n\nEven though MiniMax-M2 is normally passive, their re-raise here suggests real strength.

Not a great hand, but I have position (button) and it's a steal situation.\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - Best position postflop, can act last on all streets.\n\n**Stack**: 356 chips (44.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Blinds are 4/8, pot is 12\n- I need to call 4 more chips to see the flop\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 is in BB with 81 chips (10 BB) - short stack\n- Only DeepSeek-V3.2 is active besides me\n\n**Opponent Analysis**:\nFrom the recall data on DeepSeek-V3.2:\n- Hand 44: Folded on river\n- Hands 45, 46: Folded preflop\n- Hand 47: Raised preflop to 28 (3.5x BB)\n- Hand 48: Folded preflop  \n- Hand 49: Raised to 20, then called 12 more (so faced a reraise), then called flop 36, turn 36, folded river\n\nThis suggests DeepSeek-V3.2 is somewhat active but also folds frequently. In hand 49 they raised but then called down and folded river, suggesting they can have marginal hands.\n\n**Decision Factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: A3o is weak, but it's a steal attempt from button\n2. **Position**: Excellent position on button\n3. **Opponent**: DeepSeek is short-stacked (81 chips = 10 BB) and has shown they can fold\n4. **Pot odds**: Calling 4 to win 12 = 3:1 odds, which is decent\n5. **Tournament**: I'm healthy stacked, can afford to play speculative hands in position\n\n**Options**:\n- **Fold**: Too tight, I have position and decent odds\n- **Call**: Could see a flop in position, but A3o doesn't play great multi-way and I'm heads-up vs BB\n- **Raise**: Steal attempt. Minimum raise to 16 (2x BB). Given opponent is short-stacked and has folded preflop a lot, this seems like a good spot to steal.\n\nI think raising to steal is the best play here. The opponent is short-stacked and has shown a tendency to fold preflop. Even if they call, I have position and can evaluate on the flop.\n\nLet me raise to 16 (minimum raise). This is a standard steal size and puts pressure on the short stack.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: As 3h - Ace with a weak kicker. This is a marginal hand, especially when facing aggression.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position post-flop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 344 chips (43 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n4. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 in the BB with only 8 chips left (1 BB). This is a very short stack.\n\n5. **Action**: \n   - I raised to 16 (2x)\n   - BB re-raised to 81 (about 10x)\n   - I need to call 65 more to a pot of 97\n\n6. **Opponent analysis from recall**: \n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 has been fairly active preflop with raises in hands #47 and #49\n   - They folded several times preflop as well\n   - In hand #49, they raised, then called a re-raise, and continued calling on flop and turn before folding river\n   - They seem capable of making moves and playing aggressively\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I need to call 65 to win 97, which is about 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed.\n\n8. **Situation analysis**: \n   - Opponent only has 8 chips left after their raise (they raised to 81 but only had 8 chips)\n   - Wait, let me re-read: DeepSeek-V3.2 has 8 chips total. They raised to 81, which means they must be all-in for 8 chips, not 81. The raise amount shown is likely the total amount they're putting in, but they can only put in 8.\n   - Actually, looking at the stack: \"DeepSeek-V3.2 - 8 chips\" - this is their current stack.\n   - So the raise to 81 is impossible unless they had more chips. Let me reconsider...\n   - The raise to 81 might be what they're trying to make it, but they can only put in their remaining 8 chips.\n   - Wait, the action says \"Seat 3 raise 81\" - this suggests they have at least 81 chips to raise with.\n   - But the player list shows \"DeepSeek-V3.2 - 8 chips\"\n   - This is contradictory. Let me assume the stack size is current after posting the BB of 8, so they started the hand with 16 chips, posted 8, and now have 8 left. But that doesn't make sense either because they couldn't raise to 81.\n   \n   Actually, I think the player list shows current stacks, and the action shows what happened. If they raised to 81, they must have had at least 81 chips. The \"8 chips\" might be outdated or incorrect. Or perhaps it's showing they have 8 big blinds? No, it says \"8 chips\".\n\nLet me reconsider: The blinds are 4/8, so 8 chips is 1 BB. It's possible the player list is showing stacks in big blinds, not chips. But it says \"344 chips (43.0 BB)\" for me, so it's showing both.\n\nI think the most logical interpretation is that DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 81, which means they have at least that many chips. The \"8 chips\" in the player list might be an error, or it might represent something else.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll focus on the action: I need to call 65 to win 97, getting about 1.5:1 pot odds.\n\n9. **Hand equity**: With A3o, against a typical 3-betting range, I likely have around 30-35% equity at best. Against a very tight range, it could be worse.\n\n10. **Opponent's range**: Given they've been active and made a large 3-bet (from 16 to 81), they likely have a strong hand. The size suggests they want to either:\n    - Get value with a strong hand (QQ+, AK)\n    - Force me to fold with a weaker hand\n    - But with only 1 BB shown, they might be desperate\n\n11. **My decision**: The pot odds are not great for A3o. I need about 40% equity, and I likely don't have it against a 3-betting range. Even if the opponent is desperate with a short stack, A3o is still dominated by many hands.\n\n12. **Tournament considerations**: With 43 BB, I'm not desperate. I can wait for better spots. Calling here would be marginal at best.\n\nI should fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: As 3h (ace suited) - This is a weak ace, offsuit, with a weak kicker\n2. **Position**: BTN (good position)\n3. **Stack**: 344 chips (43 BB)\n4. **Action**: \n   - I raised to 16 (2x BB)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 3-bet to 81 (over 5x my raise)\n   - I need to call 65 more\n\n5. **Opponent information**: DeepSeek-V3.2 is very aggressive preflop based on recent history:\n   - Hand 47: raised to 28\n   - Hand 49: raised to 20, then called a reraise\n   - They seem to be playing very aggressively with a short stack (only 8 chips left after posting BB)\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot before my raise: 12 (SB+BB)\n   - My raise to 16: pot becomes 28\n   - Their raise to 81: pot becomes 109\n   - I need to call 65 to win 109\n   - Pot odds: 109:65 or about 1.68:1\n   - This means I need ~37% equity to break even\n\n7. **Equity consideration**: A3o typically has about 30-35% equity against a reasonable 3-betting range. Against a very aggressive player, it might be closer to 40-45%, but this is still marginal.\n\n8. **Opponent's stack**: They only have 8 chips left after posting BB, so they're effectively all-in with this 3-bet. This looks like a desperate move from a short stack.\n\n9. **My situation**: I have a healthy stack of 43 BB. This is a marginal spot with a weak ace. While the opponent is aggressive and might be bluffing, A3o is just too weak to call a 3-bet with, especially when I'm out of position post-flop (even though I'm on the button, I'll be first to act if we both check).\n\nThe aggressive 3-bet from a short stack could be a desperation move, but A3o is just not strong enough to call. I should fold and preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nLet me reconsider - actually, the opponent only has 8 chips total, but they raised to 81. That doesn't make sense mathematically. Let me recalculate - they posted BB of 8, so they had at least 8 chips. If they raised to 81, they must have had at least 81 chips. The \"8 chips\" shown might be after posting the BB, but that would mean they started with 89 chips total, which is still very short.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: \"Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 8 chips\" - this is their current stack after posting the BB. So they started the hand with at least 89 chips (81 + 8). This is still a short stack of ~11 BB.\n\nGiven their aggressive history and short stack, this could be a wide range. However, A3o is still too weak to call a 3-bet, even from an aggressive short stack. The kicker is terrible, and I'm dominated by any better ace.\n\nI should fold.",

DeepSeek-V3.2 is quite aggressive from the SB, frequently raising. They've made raises of 24, 28, 20, and a big 3-bet of 81.\n2. MiniMax-M2 is also aggressive, especially when they enter pots. They 3-bet in hand 49 and bet all three streets.\n3. DeepSeek has shown they'll fold to pressure (folded to flop bet in 43, folded to river bet in 44, folded to river bet in 49).\n4. Both opponents have shown aggressive tendencies but also capability to fold.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\nAcTc is a strong hand on the button. It's:\n- A decent Ace that plays well post-flop\n- Suited, giving flush potential\n- Good stealing hand\n- Can dominate weaker Aces and Tens\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN, the best position. I have 43 BB which is a healthy stack.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- I have a strong hand in great position\n- Both opponents have shown aggression, which means they can have wide ranges\n- DeepSeek in SB has been very active and aggressive\n- MiniMax in BB has also shown aggression when they play\n- I want to take control of the hand with my strong hand\n- Raising can isolate one opponent or take down the blinds\n- With 43 BB, I have room to play post-flop\n\n**Recommendation:** Raise to about 3x the big blind (24 chips) to:\n1. Build the pot with a strong hand\n2. Isolate one opponent\n3. Take control of the hand\n4. Put pressure on the aggressive opponents\n\nIf I get 3-bet, I can evaluate based on sizing and opponent tendencies. Given DeepSeek's big 3-bet in hand 50 (81 chips), I should be prepared to fold if they make a large 3-bet, but call smaller ones.\n\nLet me raise to 24.",

Risky if they have a draw.\n- **Bet**: Protect my hand against draws, get value from weaker hands. But what size?\n\n\nThe board texture demands a strategic value bet. Two diamonds create potential flush draws, while connected cards suggest straight possibilities. A carefully sized bet can protect my hand while extracting value. I'll need to balance between charging draws and not overcommitting with a potentially vulnerable top pair. The opponent's check indicates possible weakness, making a probing bet attractive. My button position gives me control, but I must be mindful of the stack depths and potential drawing hands that could challenge my current holding.\n\nA moderate bet around 26-32 chips seems optimal - substantial enough to discourage draws while maintaining flexibility for future streets. This sizing pressures opponents with marginal hands and sets up potential later-street decisions without risking my entire stack prematurely.\n\nI'll bet 28 chips to protect my hand and gather information about my opponent's potential holdings.",

In hand 49 they were very aggressive with multiple streets of betting.\n\n**My Analysis:**\nI have a strong hand with multiple ways to improve:\n1. Top pair with Ace kicker - likely best hand right now\n2. Nut flush draw - any club gives me the nut flush\n3. If they have a straight draw with 7-8, I'm currently ahead\n4. I have 12 outs: 9 clubs for flush + 3 remaining tens (but I already have top pair)\n\nThe pot is 108 and I have 292 behind. This is a good spot to build the pot with my strong hand + draw.\n\nI should bet for value and to protect my hand. I don't want to give free cards to potential straight draws or weaker flush draws.\n\n**Decision:** I should make a value bet. The minimum raise is 28, but with the pot at 108, I should bet larger - perhaps around 60-80 chips to build the pot and charge draws.\n\nLet me bet around 70-80 chips, which is a solid value bet with my top pair + nut flush draw.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: As 6s - Ace of spades and 6 of spades. This is a decent suited Ace hand, but the kicker is weak. I have potential for nut flushes, but straight possibilities are limited.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position at the table. I act last postflop.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 388 chips (48.5 BB)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB): 105 chips (13.1 BB) - This is a short stack\n\n4. **Opponent behavior**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's recent actions:\n   - They frequently raise preflop (hands 41, 43, 47, 49, 50, 52)\n   - They fold to pressure sometimes (hands 42, 45, 46, 48, 51)\n   - In hand 50, they raised 81 which was a big portion of their stack\n   - In hand 52 (most recent), they raised 101 which is almost their entire stack\n\n5. **Current situation**: \n   - Blinds are 4/8, so I'm posting SB (4 chips)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 is BB with 105 chips\n   - It's folded to me\n   - I need to call 4 more chips to see a flop\n   - Minimum raise is to 16\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I'm in decent shape with 48.5 BB\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 is short-stacked at 13.1 BB\n   - The other players are either folded or out\n\n7. **Decision factors**:\n   - With A6s on the button vs a short-stacked BB who has been aggressive, this is a good spot to raise\n   - I can steal the blinds or get called by worse hands\n   - If I get 3-bet, I can easily fold\n   - The suited Ace has good playability postflop\n   - I have position advantage\n\n8. **Sizing**: Minimum raise is 16. Given that the BB is short-stacked and has been aggressive, I could:\n   - Raise to 16 (2x BB) - standard steal size\n   - Raise to 20-24 - to put more pressure on the short stack\n   \nI think raising to 20 is a good size - it's enough to put pressure but not committing too many chips. This gives me fold equity against the short stack while maintaining a good risk/reward ratio.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The minimum raise is 16, which is 2x BB. Given that:\n- I'm on the button\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 is short-stacked and has shown aggression\n- I have a playable hand (A6s)\n- I want to apply pressure but not risk too much\n\nA standard raise to 16 (2x BB) is appropriate here. It's a good steal size from the button. If they 3-bet, I can fold. If they call, I have position and a decent hand to play postflop.\n\nLet me raise to 16.",

My opponent called my preflop raise, which suggests they have some hand strength. They could have:\n- Any King or Jack (top pair)\n- A club draw\n- Pocket pairs\n- Straight draws (QT, Q9, T9)\n\nWith Ace-high and a backdoor flush draw, I have some equity but I'm likely behind. However, this is a good spot for a continuation bet because:\n1. I raised preflop and should represent strength\n2. The board is scary with two high cards\n3. My opponent is short-stacked and may fold to pressure\n4. I have position and can control the action\n\nI should make a small continuation bet to see where I stand and potentially take down the pot now. A bet of around 16-20 chips (half pot) would be appropriate.\n\nLet me make a continuation bet of 16 chips (half pot) to put pressure on the short stack.",

They've made several large raises (20, 81, 101) and seem to play a wide range. They folded on the river in hand 49 after calling multiple streets, suggesting they can be pushed off hands.\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (BB):**\n- Hand 49: Bet 36 on turn and river (showing aggression)\n- Hand 50: Folded preflop\n- Hand 51: Called 16 preflop, checked flop, called 28, checked turn, folded turn\n- Hand 52: Folded preflop\n- Hand 53: Folded preflop\n\nMiniMax seems more selective preflop, folding most hands (3 out of 5), but showing postflop aggression when they do play. They folded on the turn in hand 51 after calling flop.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A5o is a marginal hand. It's dominated by better aces (AJ, AQ, AK) and has poor kicker. However, it has some playability due to the ace.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last postflop.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: DeepSeek is short with 93 chips (about 12 BB). This is critical - they're in push/fold territory. MiniMax has a healthy stack similar to mine.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: DeepSeek has been aggressive and might shove preflop. MiniMax is more selective but plays aggressively postflop.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 12 (1.5:1), which is good immediate odds.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. I should avoid marginal spots that could jeopardize my tournament life. DeepSeek is desperate and might shove.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- If I call 8 and DeepSeek shoves for 93, I'd have to call 85 more to win 109 (about 1.28:1). With A5o, that's not great against a short-stack's shoving range which likely includes many better aces, pairs, and broadway cards.\n- If I raise, I might isolate DeepSeek but risk getting re-raised all-in by them or called by MiniMax with a better hand.\n- The button gives me position advantage postflop if both call.\n\n**Best play**: I think the optimal play here is to **fold**. Here's why:\n- A5o is too weak to call against a short-stacked opponent who might shove\n- Even if I call and DeepSeek doesn't shove, I'm likely out of position postflop against MiniMax (though I'm on button, DeepSeek is SB so they act first)\n- The kicker is terrible - I'm dominated by so many hands\n- I preserve my healthy stack for better spots\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. I'm on the BUTTON, so I have position on BOTH players postflop. And the call is only 8 chips (1 BB) into a pot of 12. That's good pot odds. \n\nBut the main issue is DeepSeek's short stack. If they shove (which is likely given their aggression and stack size), I'll be forced to call 85 more chips with A5o. That's a -EV spot.\n\nLet me think about raising. If I raise to something like 24-32:\n- DeepSeek might fold their marginal hands or shove with their strong hands\n- MiniMax might fold their marginal hands or call with strong hands\n\nGiven DeepSeek's aggression and short stack, they could easily shove over my raise. With A5o, I don't want to call a shove.\n\nI think the safest and most profitable"

MiniMax is more selective but plays aggressively postflop.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 12 (1.5:1), which is good immediate odds.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. I should avoid marginal spots that could jeopardize my tournament life. DeepSeek is desperate and might shove.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- If I call 8 and DeepSeek shoves for 93, I'd have to call 85 more to win 109 (about 1.28:1). With A5o, that's not great against a short-stack's shoving range which likely includes many better aces, pairs, and broadway cards.\n- If I raise, I might isolate DeepSeek but risk getting re-raised all-in by them or called by MiniMax with a better hand.\n- The button gives me position advantage postflop if both call.\n\n**Best play**: I think the optimal play here is to **fold**. Here's why:\n- A5o is too weak to call against a short-stacked opponent who might shove\n- Even if I call and DeepSeek doesn't shove, I'm likely out of position postflop against MiniMax (though I'm on button, DeepSeek is SB so they act first)\n- The kicker is terrible - I'm dominated by so many hands\n- I preserve my healthy stack for better spots\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. I'm on the BUTTON, so I have position on BOTH players postflop. And the call is only 8 chips (1 BB) into a pot of 12. That's good pot odds. \n\nBut the main issue is DeepSeek's short stack. If they shove (which is likely given their aggression and stack size), I'll be forced to call 85 more chips with A5o. That's a -EV spot.\n\nLet me think about raising. If I raise to something like 24-32:\n- DeepSeek might fold their marginal hands or shove with their strong hands\n- MiniMax might fold their marginal hands or call with strong hands\n\nGiven DeepSeek's aggression and short stack, they could easily shove over my raise. With A5o, I don't want to call a shove.\n\nI think the safest and most profitable",

This suggests they might be trying to see a cheap flop or they have a weaker hand than usual.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I can check and see the flop for free, or I can raise to take control.\n\n6. **Stack sizes**: I have 400 chips (50 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With a 50 BB stack, I can afford to play speculative hands like suited aces, especially when I can see the flop cheaply.\n\nGiven that I can see the flop for free (check) and I have a suited ace that plays well postflop, I should check. Raising would be an option if I wanted to isolate, but since I'm out of position and the opponent has shown aggression in the past, checking to see a free flop with my suited ace is the best play here.\n\nThe opponent's limp is suspicious given their previous aggressive pattern, but I shouldn't overplay A4s out of position. Checking is the standard and optimal play here.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 9h 2d - This is a very weak hand, one of the worst in poker (offsuit, low cards, no straight potential).\n\n**Position**: BB (Big Blind) - I'm out of position post-flop.\n\n**Stack**: 404 chips (50.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 4, then raised to 16\n- I need to call 8 more chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's history from the recall:\n- They fold preflop frequently (hands 46, 50, 52, 53, 55)\n- They raise occasionally (hand 49 raised to 32 preflop, then bet aggressively on all streets)\n- They call sometimes (hands 47, 51, 54)\n- In hand 49, they showed down Td 7d and were very aggressive\n- In hand 54, they called 85 preflop (big bet) and then bet 85 on flop\n\nThis opponent seems to play a mix of styles - sometimes tight, sometimes aggressive. The raise to 16 from SB could be a steal attempt or could be a strong hand.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, so 3:1 odds. This is good pot odds, but...\n\n**Hand Equity**: 9-2 offsuit has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a random hand, 9-2o only wins about 38% of the time. Against a typical raising range, it's much worse (probably 20-25% at best).\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: \n- I have a healthy stack of 50.5 BB\n- There's no need to get involved with such a weak hand\n- Even though pot odds are decent, the hand has very poor playability post-flop\n- Being out of position makes it even worse\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is an easy fold. 9-2 offsuit is a trash hand that should almost never be played, especially out of position against a raise. The pot odds don't compensate for the terrible hand strength and poor post-flop playability.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ks As - This is the best starting hand in poker (pocket rockets, but suited). It's a premium hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. I get to act last on every street.\n\n3. **Stack**: 400 chips (50 BB) - This is a healthy stack, not too short, not too deep.\n\n4. **Opponent**: Only MiniMax-M2 is active with 506 chips in the Big Blind. Everyone else has folded.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 12 chips (3:1 odds). With AA, this is trivial.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: Let me review what I found:\n   - MiniMax-M2 has been fairly active preflop\n   - They've raised preflop in hands #49 (32 chips) and #56 (16 chips)\n   - They've called preflop raises multiple times\n   - They seem to be a straightforward player who bets when they have something\n   \n7. **Strategic considerations**:\n   - With AA on the button, I want to build the pot\n   - I have position advantage\n   - My opponent has a healthy stack to play with\n   - I should raise for value and to isolate\n   - Standard raise size would be 3x the big blind = 24 chips, or perhaps a bit larger since I'm out of position to the BB\n\n8. **Raise sizing**: The minimum raise is 16, but with AA I should raise more. A standard raise would be 3x BB = 24 chips, or maybe 2.5x-3x given my position advantage. Since I need to put in 4 more to call, and minimum raise is 16 total, a good raise would be to 24-32 chips.\n\nGiven I have position and a premium hand against one opponent, I should raise to build the pot. I'll go with a standard 3x raise to 24 chips.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the raise sizing. The big blind is 8, so:\n- Call would be 4 more (to match the 8)\n- Minimum raise is 16 total (which would be a raise of 8 over the BB)\n- A standard 3x BB raise would be 24 total\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's history, they made a raise to 16 in hand #56, which is exactly 2x the BB. In hand #49, they raised to 32 which is 4x the BB.\n\nGiven I have the absolute nuts preflop and position, I should raise to either:\n1. 24 (3x BB) - standard sizing\n\n\n2. 32 (4x BB) - to match their previous large raise\n\nI'll go with 24 as it's a standard sizing that builds the pot without being overly suspicious. This approach balances value extraction with maintaining a strategic edge, encouraging my opponent to potentially call or re-raise with a weaker hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** Ks As - Top pair with top kicker on a K-7-2 rainbow board. This is a very strong hand.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button, which is good position.\n\n**Stack:** 380 chips (47.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Board:** 7h Kd 2c - Rainbow board with no flush draws. Only straight draw would be something like 3-4-5 or 4-5-6, which is unlikely given the action.\n\n**Pot:** 64 chips\n**Amount to call:** 16 chips\n**Pot odds:** 80:16 or 5:1 - Very good odds.\n\n**Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 in the BB. Let me review their recent actions:\n- Hand 56: Preflop raise 16\n- Hand 55: Preflop fold\n- Hand 54: Preflop call 85, then flop bet 85\n- Hand 53: Preflop fold\n- Hand 52: Preflop fold\n- Hand 51: Preflop call 16, flop check, call 28, turn check-fold\n- Hand 50: Preflop fold\n- Hand 49: Preflop raise 32, then aggressive betting on flop (36), turn (36), river (36)\n\nMiniMax seems to play aggressively when they have strong hands (hand 49, 54, 56) but also folds frequently. Their flop bet of 16 into a 64 chip pot is a small bet (25% pot).\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** I have top pair, top kicker (AK). This is a very strong hand on this dry board.\n2. **Opponent's range:** They called preflop from BB. Could have Kx, pocket pairs, suited connectors, etc. Their small flop bet could be:\n   - A weak king trying to \"see where they're at\"\n   - A pair like 77 or 22 (but 22 would have flopped a set)\n   - A bluff with air\n   - A strong hand trying to induce action (less likely given bet sizing)\n3. **Equity:** I'm likely ahead of most of their range. Only behind 77, 22, K7, K2, and 72. \n\nI have a commanding chip lead and a premium hand. The small flop bet suggests vulnerability, giving me an excellent opportunity to apply pressure with a substantial raise. My position and chip stack allow me to control the hand's tempo and potentially force a difficult decision from my opponent. A raise here can extract maximum value and potentially take down the pot immediately.",

They don't always fold to pressure.\n\n**Hand history this hand**:\n- Preflop: I raised to 24, opponent called (showing some strength)\n- Flop: Opponent bet 16 (small bet), I raised to 64, opponent called (showing they have something)\n- Turn: Opponent bets 48 into a pot of ~176\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **My hand strength**: Top pair, top kicker. Very strong hand on this board. Only losing to sets (77, 22, KK - unlikely), two pairs (KJ, K7, J7), or possibly a slowplayed AA.\n\n2. **Opponent's range**: Based on their actions:\n   - They called my preflop raise\n   - They bet flop (small), called my raise\n   - They bet turn\n   \n   This suggests they have a strong hand. Possible holdings:\n   - KQ, KJ, KT (top pair weaker kicker)\n   - Sets (77, 22)\n   - Two pairs (KJ, K7)\n   - Maybe a bluff or draw (but board is relatively dry)\n   \n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 48 to win 224 (pot) = 4.67:1 pot odds. I only need ~17.6% equity to call. I definitely have more than that.\n\n4. **Position**: I have position, which is good. I can control the pot size on the river.\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: I have 316 chips left, pot is 224. This is a significant pot.\n\n**Decision**: \nI have a very strong hand (top pair, top kicker). The opponent is showing strength but could have many worse hands (KQ, KJ, KT). The board is relatively dry with no flush draws. \n\nI should raise here to:\n1. Get value from worse hands\n2. Charge any draws (though there aren't many)\n3. Build the pot with my strong hand\n\nGiven the pot size (224) and the bet (48), a raise to about 150-180 seems appropriate. This would be a raise of about 100-130 more.\n\nMinimum raise is 96, but that's too small. I want to make a substantial raise that:\n- Gets value from worse hands\n- Doesn't commit my entire stack yet\n- Allows me to fold if the opponent shoves and I'm beat\n\nLet me raise to 180 total (132 more). This puts pressure on the opponent while keeping some chips behind if things go wrong.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The pot is 224, opponent bet 48. If I raise to 180:\n- Opponent would need to call 132 more\n- Pot would be 404 if they call\n- I'd have 136 left\n\nThat's a bit too committal. Let me raise to 150 instead:\n- Opponent calls 102 more\n- Pot would be 374 if they call\n- I'd have 166 left\n\nThis gives me better stack flexibility on the river.\n\nWait, let me check the minimum raise again. It's 96, which is just a min-raise. I should raise more than that.\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive tendencies shown in hand 49 (betting all streets), they might call a larger raise with worse hands.\n\nI'll go with a raise to 160 total (112 more). This is a solid raise that:\n- Gets value from worse hands\n- Charges them appropriately\n- Keeps me from being pot-committed\n- Gives me room to maneuver on the river\n\nActually, looking at my stack of 316, if I raise to 160, I'll have 156 left.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: Ks As (Ace-King suited spades)\n**Position**: BTN\n**Stack**: 316 chips (39.5 BB)\n**Board**: 7h Kd 2c Jh\n**Pot**: 224 chips\n**To call**: 48 chips\n\n**Current situation**: \n- I have top pair (Kings) with top kicker (Ace)\n- Board: 7h Kd 2c Jh - Rainbow board with no flush draw\n- Possible straight draws: Q-10 would make a straight if a 10 comes\n- I have position on the opponent (BTN vs BB)\n\n**Opponent (MiniMax-M2) tendencies**:\nFrom the recall, I can see:\n- Hand 49: Made a preflop raise, then bet flop, turn, and river (very aggressive line)\n- Hand 51: Called preflop, checked flop, called a bet, then check-folded turn\n- Hand 54: Called a large preflop bet (85), then bet 85 on flop\n- Hand 56: Made a small preflop raise (16)\n\nThe opponent seems to be capable of both aggressive betting and calling large bets. They don't always fold to pressure.\n\n**Hand history this hand**:\n- Preflop: I raised to 24, opponent called (showing some strength)\n- Flop: Opponent bet 16 (small bet), I raised to 64, opponent called (showing they have something)\n- Turn: Opponent bets 48 into a pot of ~176\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **My hand strength**: Top pair, top kicker. Very strong hand on this board. Only losing to sets (77, 22, KK - unlikely), two pairs (KJ, K7, J7), or possibly a slowplayed AA.\n\n2. **Opponent's range**: Based on their actions:\n   - They called my preflop raise\n   - They bet flop (small), called my raise\n   - They bet turn\n   \n   This suggests they have a strong hand. Possible holdings:\n   - KQ, KJ, KT (top pair weaker kicker)\n   - Sets (77, 22)\n   - Two pairs (KJ, K7)\n   - Maybe a bluff or draw (but board is relatively dry)\n   \n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 48 to win 224 (pot) = 4.67:1 pot odds. I only need ~17.6% equity to call. I definitely have more than that.\n\n4. **Position**: I have position, which is good. I can control the pot size on the river.\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: I have 316 chips left, pot is 224. This is a significant pot.\n\n**Decision**: \nI have a very strong hand (top pair, top kicker). The opponent is showing strength but could have many worse hands (KQ, KJ, KT). The board is relatively dry with no flush draws. \n\nI should raise here to:\n1. Get value from worse hands\n2. Charge any draws (though there aren't many)\n3. Build the pot with my strong hand\n\nGiven the pot size (224) and the bet (48), a raise to about 150-180 seems appropriate. This would be a raise of about 100-130 more.\n\nMinimum raise is 96, but that's too small. I want to make a substantial raise that:\n- Gets value from worse hands\n- Doesn't commit my entire stack yet\n- Allows me to fold if the opponent shoves and I'm beat\n\nLet me raise to 180 total (132 more). This puts pressure on the opponent while keeping some chips behind if things go wrong.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The pot is 224, opponent bet 48. If I raise to 180:\n- Opponent would need to call 132 more\n- Pot would be 404 if they call\n- I'd have 136 left\n\nThat's a bit too committal. Let me raise to 150 instead:\n- Opponent calls 102 more\n- Pot would be 374 if they call\n- I'd have 166 left\n\nThis gives me better stack flexibility on the river.\n\nWait, let me check the minimum raise again. It's 96, which is just a min-raise. I should raise more than that.\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive tendencies shown in hand 49 (betting all streets), they might call a larger raise with worse hands.\n\nI'll go with a raise to 160 total (112 more). This is a solid raise that:\n- Gets value from worse hands\n- Charges them appropriately\n- Keeps me from being pot-committed\n- Gives me room to maneuver on the river\n\nActually, looking at my stack of 316, if I raise to 160, I'll have 156 left.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n**My hand**: Ks As (Ace-King suited spades)\n**Board**: 7h Kd 2c Jh 3s\n**Position**: BTN\n**Stack**: 156 chips (19.5 BB)\n**Pot**: 496 chips\n\nI have top pair with top kicker (King with Ace kicker). The board is 7h Kd 2c Jh 3s, which is relatively dry - no flush possible (4 different suits), and no straight possible. \n\nThe action has been very aggressive throughout:\n- Preflop: I raised to 24, opponent called\n- Flop: I raised their bet from 16 to 64, they called\n- Turn: I raised their bet from 48 to 160, they called\n- River: They checked to me\n\nThe pot is now 496 chips and I only have 156 chips left. This means the pot is about 3.2x my stack.\n\nLooking at opponent's history (Seat 4 - MiniMax-M2):\n- They've been fairly active and aggressive\n- They called my turn raise which was substantial\n- They just checked on the river\n\nGiven the board texture and the action, I have a strong hand. However, I need to consider what hands my opponent could have that would call all the way to the river and then check:\n- They could have a King with a weaker kicker\n- They could have two pair (KJ, K7, K3, J7, J3, 73)\n- They could have a set (77, 22, JJ but these are less likely given preflop action)\n- They could be bluffing or have a missed draw\n\nSince they checked to me on the river, they're likely either:\n1. Weak and giving up\n2. Inducing a bet with a monster\n3. Have a marginal hand that can't call a big bet\n\nGiven my stack size (156) relative to the pot (496), I should go all-in. If they fold, I win a big pot. If they call, I'm getting great pot odds and I have a strong hand that likely wins against their range.\n\nLet me check the minimum raise amount: 112 chips. Since I only have 156, I can raise to 156 (all-in).",

This is a marginal hand at best. The King is very scary, and my kicker is terrible (3). If MiniMax has any King, I'm way behind. If they have a flush draw, they're drawing to beat me. If they have a better 7 (like A7, 87, etc.), I'm also behind.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven:\n1. Very weak hand (bottom pair, bad kicker)\n2. Scary board (King present)\n3. Out of position\n4. Opponent seems aggressive (could be betting with many hands)\n5. Pot is tiny (16 chips) - not worth fighting for\n6. My stack is healthy - no need to take marginal spots\n\nI should check. There's no reason to bet here with such a weak hand. I want to see a free card or control the pot size. If MiniMax bets after I check, I'll likely fold unless it's a very small bet.\n\nLet me check to see what happens.",

I have bottom pair. \n\nGiven that:\n1. My opponent checked the flop after I checked, suggesting weakness\n2. The turn brought a 6s, adding another spade and completing some straight draws\n3. I have a weak pair that might be ahead but is vulnerable\n4. I have a healthy stack and don't need to take risks\n5. My opponent has shown aggression but also checked the flop\n\nI should check here. Betting would be risky with just bottom pair on a coordinated board, and I want to see a free showdown if possible. If they bet the turn, I can decide whether to call based on the size, but checking keeps the pot small with my marginal hand.\n\nI don't need to use any more tools - I have enough information about my opponent's tendencies.",

I have bottom pair with a 3 kicker. The board is coordinated with both flush and straight draws. My opponent is aggressive and has been betting. Even though the pot odds are decent (25% needed), my hand is likely beat by:\n- Any King\n- Any better 7 (K7, A7, etc.)\n- Any two pair\n- Any straight draw that hit\n- Any flush draw that might be semibluffing\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive nature and the coordinated board, I should fold. My hand has little showdown value and is easily dominated. I don't want to invest more chips with such a weak holding.\n\nI should fold.",

Hand #58: MiniMax-M2 checked preflop, then bet turn\n\nPatterns I see:\n- MiniMax-M2 is aggressive and likes to bet, especially when they have position or initiative\n- They call preflop raises fairly often (hands #51, #54, #57)\n- They 3-bet preflop with marginal hands (K4o in #49)\n- They frequently continuation bet and barrel multiple streets\n- They've shown willingness to call down with marginal holdings\n\nWith Q4o on the button:\n- This is a trash hand (unsuited, 4-gap)\n- I'm out of position against an aggressive player\n- I have a healthy stack (99.5 BB)\n\n\n- I could potentially steal, but MiniMax-M2's aggressive nature makes this risky\n- The 3:1 pot odds aren't compelling enough to call with such a weak hand\n\nI'll fold this trash hand. The combination of poor card quality, positional disadvantage, and opponent's aggressive playing style makes this an easy decision. No point risking chips on a hand with such low potential.\n\nThe key factors are clear: weak starting hand, likely dominated, and facing an opponent who frequently 3-bets and barrels. It's simply not worth the risk to continue with Q4o.",

MiniMax-M2 has shown they'll call raises and play postflop. I should make a standard raise. The minimum raise is to 16 total (which would be 8 more for them to call).\n\nGiven they're short-stacked at 14 BB, I could also consider a larger raise to put pressure on them. A standard raise size would be 3x the big blind = 24 chips total, or about 2.5x = 20 chips.\n\nLet me think about sizing:\n- Minimum raise to 16 (2x BB) - might invite calls from weaker hands\n- Raise to 20 (2.5x BB) - standard\n- Raise to 24 (3x BB) - also standard\n- Larger raise to put pressure on their short stack\n\nSince they're short-stacked and have shown they'll call raises, I should make a solid raise. I'll go with 24 (3x BB) which is a standard preflop raise size. This builds the pot with my premium hand and puts pressure on their short stack.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I have AK offsuit (Ac Kh) - a premium hand\n- I'm on the Button (best position)\n- My stack: 796 chips (49.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Amount to call: 8 chips (half the big blind)\n- Minimum raise: 32 chips\n- Only one opponent (MiniMax-M2) with 98 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Hand 57: Called flop, bet turn, called turn, checked river, called river (showing some aggression and willingness to call)\n- Hand 58: Called preflop, checked flop, bet turn (small bet of 8 into what was likely a small pot)\n- Hand 60: Called preflop then folded preflop (showing some selectivity)\n\nThe opponent has a short stack (98 chips, ~6 BB) and seems to be playing somewhat passively but has shown some aggression with small bets.\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\nWith AK on the button against a single opponent in the big blind:\n1. **Hand strength**: AK is a premium hand, especially against one opponent\n2. **Position**: Button gives me position advantage post-flop\n3. **Opponent stack**: Short stack (98 chips) means if I raise and they shove, I can easily call\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24 (3:1 odds) - great odds even if I just call\n\nI should definitely raise here for several reasons:\n- Build the pot with a strong hand\n- Isolate the single opponent\n- Extract value from weaker hands\n- Put pressure on the short stack\n\nGiven the opponent's short stack (98 chips), if I raise to about 48-64 chips (3-4x BB), it gives them a tough decision. A standard raise would be 3x BB = 48 chips, but since I'm on the button with a premium hand against a short stack, I could go slightly bigger to 64 chips (4x BB) to really put pressure on them and potentially take down the pot preflop or set up a post-flop scenario where they have a tough decision with their short stack.\n\nLet me raise to 64 chips which is 4x the big blind - a solid standard raise that puts pressure on the short stack while still giving me flexibility post-flop.",

This is one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - This is the best position, but my hand is too weak to play even in position.\n\n**Stack**: 820 chips (51.2 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Pot**: 24 chips\n**Amount to call**: 8 (to complete the big blind)\n**Minimum raise to**: 32\n\n**Players**: \n- Seat 1 (me): 820 chips\n- Seat 2: 0 chips (folded)\n- Seat 3: 0 chips (folded)\n- Seat 4: 74 chips (BB)\n- Seat 5: 0 chips (folded)\n\nOnly Seat 4 is active with 74 chips in the big blind.\n\nLet me think about this:\n1. **Hand strength**: 2-8 offsuit is extremely weak. It's not connected, not suited, and the cards are low. This hand has very little postflop potential.\n\n2. **Position**: While being on the button is good, it's not enough to justify playing such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 4 has 74 chips (4.6 BB), which is a short stack. They might be desperate and could shove with a wide range. If I call 8 and they shove, I'd have to call 74 more into a pot of 98 (24+74+?).\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, which is 3:1 odds. Even with these odds, 2-8 offsuit is just too weak.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack of 51.2 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands. The goal is to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.\n \nThe optimal play is clearly to fold this terrible hand. Despite the small potential pot, the risk of losing chips with such a weak starting hand far outweighs any potential gain.

That's 3:1 pot odds. With T4 offsuit, even these odds don't justify calling. \n\n**Tournament considerations**: With a 51 BB stack, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my stack and wait for better opportunities.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. T4 offsuit is just too weak, even with good pot odds and position.

          "content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BB (big blind)\n- Cards: 8c 8d (pocket 8s)\n- Stack: 804 chips (50.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 98 chips\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 82 from SB\n- I need to call 66 more\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Seat 4 - MiniMax-M2):**\nLooking at the recall data, I can see MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Hand 53: preflop fold\n- Hand 54: preflop call 85, then flop bet 85\n- Hand 55: preflop fold\n- Hand 56: preflop raise 16 (min-raise)\n- Hand 57: preflop call 16, flop bet 16, call 48, turn bet 48, call 112, river check, call 156\n- Hands 58, 60, 61, 62, 64: various folds\n\nShowdown hands for MiniMax-M2:\n- Hand 57: J8 (Jd 8d) - shows they play suited connectors/gappers\n- Other showdowns show random hands like QJ, 34s, K6, T7s\n\n**My Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket 8s is a strong hand, especially against a single opponent. It's a made hand that doesn't need improvement.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, which is disadvantageous postflop, but I only have one opponent (the SB).\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: MiniMax-M2 seems to be an aggressive player who makes large raises and bets. The raise to 82 from SB is a 5x+ raise (from 16 to 82), which is quite large. This could indicate:\n   - A very strong hand trying to extract value\n   - A bluff/semi-bluff with a weaker hand\n   - A standard aggressive play\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: \n   - Pot is 98, I need to call 66\n   - Pot odds: 98:66 or ~1.48:1\n   - This means I need ~40% equity to call\n\n5. **Stack Considerations**: I have 50 BB, which is a healthy stack. Calling or raising here won't jeopardize my tournament life.\n\n**Decision Time:**\nWith pocket 8s, I have a few options:\n\n**Fold**: Too tight. 88 is a strong hand, especially against one opponent.\n\n**Call**: Reasonable. I can see a flop and evaluate. The pot odds are decent (need ~40% equity). Against a random hand, 88 has about 70% equity. Even against a strong range (TT+, AQ+), 88 has around 40-45% equity.\n\n**Raise**: Also reasonable. I could:\n- Make a small 3-bet to 180-200 to take control\n- Go all-in for 804 to maximize fold equity\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 made a large raise (82), they might have a strong hand, but they could also be bluffing. With pocket 8s, I want to:\n1. Get value from weaker hands\n2. Protect against overcards\n3. Avoid difficult decisions on overcard flops\n\nA 3-bet to around 200-220 would be a good middle ground. It builds the pot with my strong hand, gives me initiative, and allows me to fold if they 4-bet shove (which would likely mean they have QQ+ or AK).\n\nLet me calculate a good raise size:\n- Minimum raise is 148\n- A standard 3-bet would be 3x their raise: 82 x 3 = 246\n- Or about 2.5x: 82 x 2.5 = 205\n\nI'll go with a raise to 210, which is a solid 3-bet size that puts pressure on them while not committing my entire stack.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking at the raise size more carefully:\n- They raised from 8 (SB) to 82, which is a 74 chip raise\n- The pot is 98 (16+82)\n- A 3-bet to 210 would be risking 210 to win 98\n\nWith 88, I should be happy to get it in against most opponents, but I need to be careful. Let me think about the stack sizes:\n- If I raise to 210 and they shove, I'd have to call 594 more into a pot of 98+210+594 = 902, getting about 1.5:1 odds\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive tendencies and my strong hand, I think a 3-bet is the right play."

It's not strong but has some potential with a Q high.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Stack depth**: Deep stack (100 BB) gives me room to play.\n4. **Opponents**: Two opponents left - SB and BB. No reads yet since this is hand #1.\n5. **Pot odds**: 2 to win 3 (1.5:1), which is decent.\n\n**Standard play**: Q7o is typically a fold from most positions, but on the button with no reads and deep stacks, it's borderline. The button position gives me significant advantage postflop.\n\n**Decision**: I think calling is reasonable here. The hand has some potential, I'm in position, and I can see a flop cheaply. Raising with Q7o would be too loose, and folding is also fine but a bit tight for the button.\n\nLet me call and see the flop.",

Against a typical raising range, I'm likely behind. However, I'm in position.\n\nLet me think about typical SB raising ranges. From the small blind, a raise could mean:\n- Strong hands (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK, AQ, AJ, KQ)\n- Some bluffs or positional raises\n\nAgainst a typical tight raising range (like 15% of hands), Q7o has about 30-35% equity.\n\nGiven:\n- I need ~46% equity based on pot odds\n- I likely have 30-35% equity against their range\n- I'm in position which adds some value\n- No history on opponent\n\nThe pot odds aren't good enough to call with Q7o.

It's offsuit and disconnected. The gap between 6 and J is large, and they're offsuit. This is a fold in almost all situations from early position.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - you act first preflop and will be out of position postflop against everyone. You need a very strong range from this position.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 198 chips (99 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: Early in a tournament, I should be playing tight and preserving my stack. 6-J offsuit from UTG is definitely a fold.\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools for this decision - it's a clear fold based on fundamental poker strategy. This is a textbook fold situation.\n\nThe amount to call is 2 chips, which would be 1% of my stack. The pot odds are good, but the hand is so weak and my position is so bad that it doesn't matter. Even if I hit a J, I'll often be dominated by AJ, KJ, QJ. If I hit a 6, it's rarely good.\n\nDecision: FOLD",

There's no value in betting here - I have absolutely no equity in this hand. If I bet, I'm pure bluffing against a player who has shown they call flops and fold turns. But with no draw and no equity, it's better to just check and give up if they bet later, or maybe catch something on the turn (though very unlikely to help my 2-9).\n\nActually, let me reconsider - with 2-9 offsuit on an A-J-7 board, there are only 6 cards that could help me (the other three 2s and three 9s), and even if I hit one, I could still be crushed. This is a clear check and fold to any bet situation.\n\nThe best play is to check and see a free card, then fold to any aggression on future streets unless I somehow hit two pair or trips (extremely unlikely).",

The opponent has shown weakness by checking flop and turn. They're a conservative player based on history. The Ace on board is scary, and I can represent having an Ace or better.\n\nGiven:\n1. My hand is worthless\n2. Opponent shows weakness (two checks)\n3. Opponent tends to fold on turns (folded turn in hand #3)\n4. Board has high cards that I can represent\n5. Pot is small so risk is low relative to my stack\n6. I have position\n\nA small bluff here seems profitable. The minimum raise is 2 chips (to 2 total), making the pot 6 chips. This gives me good odds - risking 2 to win 4 (2:1 odds), and if opponent folds 40%+ of the time, it's profitable.\n\nLet me make a small bluff bet.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - excellent position\n- Cards: 7s 7d - pocket sevens, a medium pocket pair\n- Stack: 199 chips (99.5 BB) - very healthy stack\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- To call: 1 chip (additional to my SB)\n- Can raise to minimum 4 chips\n\n**Opponent Information:**\nLooking at the recall data for Kimi-K2 in Seat 2 (the BB):\n- Hand 1: Preflop raise 8 (I was in SB that hand and folded)\n- Hand 2: Preflop raise 6, then folded on flop\n- Hand 3: Preflop fold\n- Hand 4: Preflop fold\n\nSo the BB has been somewhat active but has folded the last 2 hands. They seem to raise fairly often when they play (8 and 6 chips).\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket sevens is a strong hand preflop, especially in position. It flops a set about 12% of the time and is ahead of most non-paired hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button - the best position postflop. This allows me to control the pot size and get maximum value.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 99.5 BB, which is excellent. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendency**: BB has been raising preflop when they play, but they've also folded the last 2 hands. They might be getting tighter or just had weak hands.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 1 more chip to win a pot of 3 chips (2.5:1 odds). This is an easy call with pocket sevens.\n\n**Decision**: \n- Just calling is an option, but with pocket pairs, we want to either:\n  a) Raise to isolate and take control, or\n  b) Call to see a cheap flop and try to hit a set\n\nGiven I'm on the button with 99.5 BB, I should raise here. Pocket sevens plays well as a raising hand in position because:\n- I can fold to a 3-bet if necessary\n- I can take control of the hand postflop\n- I can build a pot when I'm likely ahead\n- I can represent strong hands on various board textures\n\nA standard raise would be 3-4x the BB, so 6-8 chips given the 2 chip BB. Since minimum is 4, I should raise to at least 6. Let me raise to 6 to keep it standard and see how the BB responds.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's pattern, they raised to 6 and 8 in previous hands. A raise to 6 keeps me consistent with their sizing and is a standard 3x raise (2 BB x 3 = 6).",

Folding is too tight with a suited connector on the button against a min-raise. Raising could be an option, but calling keeps the pot small and allows me to use my positional advantage post-flop. The hand has good playability and I have the chips to see the flop.\n\nThe call is 4 chips, which is only 2% of my stack - a very small investment for a hand with good potential.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with 9d 8d\n- Flop: 7d 8h Ac\n- Pot: 19 chips\n- Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 8 chips\n- I need to call 8 chips\n- Minimum raise to: 16 chips\n- My stack: 198 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have middle pair (8s) with a gutshot straight draw (need a 6 to make a straight)\n- I also have a backdoor flush draw (I need two more diamonds)\n- The board has an Ace which is scary - opponent could have Ax\n- My 9d 8d gives me some potential\n\n**Opponent tendencies (MiniMax-M2 from recall):**\n- Hand 1: Preflop fold\n- Hand 2: Preflop call 4, flop bet 4\n- Hand 3: Preflop call 1, flop bet 2, turn bet 2\n- Hand 4: Preflop fold\n- Hand 5: Preflop fold\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 tends to bet on the flop and turn when they enter pots (hands 2 and 3). They seem to be a fairly aggressive player who continuation bets frequently. They also called preflop raises in hands 2 and 3.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- They raised preflop to 4 (small raise)\n- I called with my suited connector\n- They bet 8 on the flop (about 42% of pot)\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 19\n- To call: 8\n- Pot odds: 27:8 or about 3.4:1\n- This means I need about 23% equity to call\n\n**My equity estimation:**\n- I have middle pair + gutshot + backdoor flush\n- Against a typical range (Ax, pairs, etc.), I probably have around 25-30% equity\n- The pot odds justify a call\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm on the button, which is great position\n- I can see what they do on the turn before acting\n\n\nI'll carefully consider raising as a strategic option. Raising could pressure my opponent and potentially take control of the hand. With my draw and position, a raise might force them to make a difficult decision. However, I need to balance the risk of building a larger pot with a marginal hand against the potential of winning immediately or gaining more information about their hand strength.\n\nThe stack depth allows for strategic maneuvering, giving me flexibility in my approach. My draw provides some interesting possibilities, though the board texture presents challenges with potential stronger hands like top pair or better draws.\n\nCarefully weighing my options, calling seems most prudent. The pot odds are favorable, and I maintain position while limiting immediate risk. A raise could unnecessarily escalate the pot size without clear advantage. By calling, I preserve my strategic flexibility and can reassess based on the turn card and opponent's subsequent action.",

I have middle pair with a decent kicker, but the board has an Ace which is scary, and there are potential straight draws (though not completed yet).\n\n**Pot odds:** \n- Pot is 35 chips\n- I need to call 8 chips\n- Pot odds = 35:8 or about 4.4:1\n- This means I need ~18.5% equity to break even\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- Hand 1: Preflop fold\n- Hand 2: Called 4 preflop, bet 4 on flop\n- Hand 3: Called 1 preflop, bet 2 on flop, bet 2 on turn\n- Hand 4: Preflop fold\n- Hand 5: Preflop fold\n\nThis opponent seems to be a relatively straightforward player who:\n- Folds weak hands preflop\n- Makes small continuation bets when they have something\n- Their bet sizing has been on the smaller side (8 on flop, now 8 on turn)\n\n**Current action:**\n- They raised preflop to 4 (small raise)\n- Bet 8 on flop (half pot)\n- Bet 8 on turn (smaller relative to current pot of 27)\n\nThe small turn bet could mean:\n1. They're trying to control the pot with a marginal hand\n2. They have a strong hand and want me to call\n3. They're making a blocking bet with a draw\n\nGiven the board texture (Ace-high), and my marginal hand (pair of 8s), I should consider:\n- The Ace is very scary - many hands have an Ace\n- I have middle pair with decent kicker\n- The opponent's betting pattern suggests they might have something but not a monster\n\n\n- Pot odds are favorable but not overwhelming\n- My hand is vulnerable to many turn cards\n\nI realize the pot odds are actually quite good. With 35 chips to win and only 8 to call, I'm getting excellent value. The opponent's consistent small betting suggests they might be trying to protect a marginal hand. While an Ace is concerning, my pair of 8s could still be ahead of their range. The small bet size indicates potential weakness, making a call more attractive. However, I need to carefully consider the potential hands that could beat me and the risk of losing more chips on the river.\n\nThe key is to weigh the immediate pot odds against the potential future betting and my hand's strength. With multiple opponents already folding and the button position, I'll need to make a strategic decision that balances potential value against risk.",

They were betting for value on flop and turn, but now they're checking on the river. This could mean:\n1. They have a mediocre hand and are scared of the flush/straight possibilities\n2. They have a strong hand and are trying to induce a bluff\n3. They have air and gave up\n\nGiven that they raised preflop and bet both flop and turn, they likely have:\n- An Ace (could be A with good kicker)\n- A pocket pair\n- Maybe a flush draw that missed\n\nThe flush draw came in on the river (3 clubs on board: Ac, 4c, Jc). If they had a flush draw, they might have been betting it, and now they either made it or missed.\n\nMy pair of 8s is relatively weak given the board texture:\n- Anyone with any club has a flush\n- Anyone with AJ, A4 has two pair\n\n\n- Any pocket pair 9s or higher beats me\n\nI'm facing a decision with a marginal hand. The opponent's check suggests uncertainty, but my 8s are vulnerable. Checking seems the safest option to control the pot size and avoid potential traps. The board's texture and my weak pair make aggression risky. I'll exercise caution and see what MiniMax-M2 does next, potentially extracting more information about their hand strength.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The user is playing No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker in a tournament. I need to analyze the current situation and provide a decision.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Position: CO (Cutoff) - Seat 1\n- Hand: 9c Qc (Queen-Nine suited, clubs)\n- Stack: 225 chips (112.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 11 chips\n- Action: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8\n- Amount to call: 8\n- Minimum raise to: 14\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nLet me analyze this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Q9s is a marginal hand. It's suited which gives some flush potential, but it's not a premium hand. It plays better in position, and I'm in CO (good position).\n\n2. **Position**: CO is good position - I act after most players but still have the BTN to act after me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: I just searched for GPT-OSS-120B's actions. Let me review:\n   - Hand 2: preflop fold\n   - Hand 3: preflop check (must have been BB), flop call 2, turn fold\n   - Hand 4: preflop call 1 (likely BB), flop check, turn check, turn fold\n   - Hand 5: preflop fold\n   - Hand 6: preflop fold\n   \n   So GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively tight/passive. They haven't shown any aggressive preflop raises until now. This is their first preflop raise in the hands I can see. This suggests they likely have a strong hand.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 11. That's 8/19 = 42% pot odds. Q9s typically has around 45-50% equity against a random hand, but against a tight player's raising range, it's much worse - probably around 30-35% equity.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (112.5 BB). I don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving my stack and looking for better opportunities is wise.\n\n6. **Action analysis**: The raise comes from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) who is in the Hijack position (one seat before me). Given their tight profile, this raise likely indicates a strong hand (premium pairs, strong broadway hands, maybe some suited connectors).\n\nWith Q9s, I'm dominated by many hands in their range (AQ, KQ, QJ, etc.). The suitedness helps but not enough to justify a call against a tight player's first preflop raise.\n\nI should fold. The hand is too weak, the opponent is showing strength with their first preflop raise, and I can preserve my chips for a better spot.\n\nDecision: fold",

          "reasoning_content": "  Good, I have some information about GPT-OSS-120B's playing style:\n\n1. **Frequently folds preflop** - In 13 recorded actions, 6 were preflop folds\n2. **Generally passive** - Only 1 preflop raise in hand #7 (8 chips)\n3. **Can call small bets** - Called 1 chip in hand #4, called 2 on flop in hand #3\n4. **Often gives up on later streets** - Folded on turn in hands #3 and #4\n\nNow let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**My hand: 9s 8c** - This is a suited connector (though not suited in this case, 9s 8c are different suits). It's a decent speculative hand that can make straights and two pairs, but it's not particularly strong preflop.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. I get to act last on every street.\n\n**Stack**: 223 chips (111.5 BB) - Healthy stack\n\n**Current action**: \n- Blinds are 1/2\n- Pot is 4 chips\n- Everyone folded to SB (Seat 5) who just called 1 (completing the small blind)\n- I posted BB of 2\n- Amount to call is 0 (I can check)\n\n**Pot odds**: If I check, I see a flop for free with 4 chips in the pot.\n\n**Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B is in the SB and just called. Based on their history, this could mean:\n- They have a marginal hand they want to see cheaply\n- They have a decent hand but are playing passively\n- They're trying to trap (less likely given their passive nature)\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 9s 8c is marginal but playable, especially in position\n2. **Position**: Excellent (on the button)\n3. **Pot odds**: Great - I can see the flop for free\n4. **Stack preservation**: Checking risks nothing\n5. **Opponent tendency**: They're passive, so checking is unlikely to induce aggression\n\n**Options**:\n- **Check**: See the flop for free, evaluate from there. Zero risk.\n- **Raise**: Try to win the pot preflop. Minimum raise is to 4 (2 more chips). Given opponent's passivity, they might fold. But if they call, I'm out of position with a marginal hand.\n- **Fold**: Not an option since I can check for free.\n\nSince I can see the flop for free and I'm in position with a speculative hand, checking is the clear best option. There's no need to risk chips preflop with 9s 8c when I can evaluate the flop texture and act with full information.\n\nI should check and see the flop.",

The board shows two 4s, and I don't have a 4. I don't have any straight draws or flush draws. My hand is complete air.\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the opponent actions I retrieved:\n- Generally tight/passive player\n- Frequently folds preflop (hands 1, 2, 5, 6, 8)\n- When they do play, they tend to be passive (check/call in hand 3, check/fold in hand 4)\n- Made one preflop raise in hand 7 (8 chips)\n- In this hand: posted SB, called 1 preflop, checked flop, checked turn\n\nThis opponent appears to be playing very passively. They've checked both flop and turn, showing weakness.\n\n**Position and Pot:**\n- I'm on the button (best position)\n- Pot is very small (4 chips)\n- I can check for free\n\n**Decision:**\nI have complete air (9-high). While I could try to bluff this passive opponent, the risk/reward isn't great:\n- The pot is tiny (4 chips)\n- Bluffing would risk chips with 9-high\n- The opponent has shown passivity but could be trapping with a monster\n- With no equity, no draw, and a passive opponent, checking is the correct play\n- I should preserve my chips for better spots\n\nWhile the opponent has been passive, bluffing with 9-high into a dry board with two 4s isn't a good play. The opponent could easily have a King or Jack and be slow-playing, or they could have a 4. Checking costs nothing and I can see the river card for free.",

So I have two pair: 8s and 4s.\n\n**Pot:** 4 chips\n**Opponent:** GPT-OSS-120B who has been passive\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent actions, GPT-OSS-120B has been:\n- Mostly folding preflop (hands 5, 6, 8)\n- When they do play, they tend to check and fold later (hands 3, 4)\n- They did make one preflop raise in hand 7\n- Overall, they seem to be a relatively tight/passive player\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nThe board is Kh Js 4c 4h 8s\n- There are two pair on board: 4s and 4s (pair of 4s)\n- I have 9s 8c, so I have a pair of 8s\n- This gives me two pair: 8s and 4s\n- Possible hands that beat me:\n  - Any hand with a K (top pair), J, or 9 would give them a higher two pair\n  - Any hand with a 4 would give them trips (444)\n  - KJ would give them two pair (Kings and Jacks)\n  - Any pocket pair higher than 8s would give them a higher two pair\n\n**River Action:**\nOpponent checked to me. The pot is small (4 chips). I have a decent but not strong hand (two pair with 8s and 4s).\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: I have two pair (8s and 4s), which is decent but vulnerable\n2. **Opponent**: Seems tight/passive based on history - they likely have something when they check\n3. **Pot size**: Very small (4 chips)\n4. **Position**: I'm on the button, last to act\n5. **Board texture**: Paired board with high cards (K, J) - many hands could beat me\n\n**Options:**\n- Check: Showdown for free, see if my two pair is good\n- Bet: Try to get value from weaker hands, but risk getting called/raised by better hands\n\nGiven that the opponent has been passive and checked on the river, they likely have a marginal hand or are giving up. However, the board is somewhat scary with two pair and high cards.\n\nWith a small pot and a decent but not strong hand, checking seems appropriate. I don't want to build a bigger pot with a vulnerable hand against a passive opponent who might be trapping with a better hand.\n\nLet me check if there's any additional information I should consider...",

The current raise to 12 is a significant bet (6x BB), which suggests real strength.\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm in SB, which is terrible position\n- I have a healthy stack of 113 BB\n- Calling would commit 11 chips (about 5% of my stack) with a very weak hand\n- Even if I hit something, I'll be out of position postflop\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot before raise: 15 chips (1+2+12)\n- To call: 11 chips\n- Pot odds: 15:11 or about 1.36:1\n- This is nowhere near enough to justify calling with 57o\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- Early tournament stage (Hand #10)\n- I have a healthy stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands\n- Preserve chips for better spots\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a trivial fold. 57o from SB facing a 6x BB raise is a clear fold.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: K9 offsuit (9h Kc)\n**Position**: Button (best position)\n**Stack**: 226 chips (113 BB) - healthy stack\n**Action**: MiniMax-M2 raised to 4 chips from MP (Seat 4)\n**Amount to call**: 4 chips\n**Pot odds**: 7 (current pot) + 4 (from raiser) = 11 chips, need to call 4 = 2.75:1\n\nLet me recall MiniMax-M2's tendencies:\nFrom the data, MiniMax-M2 has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in hands 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10 (6 out of 7 hands)\n- Raised to 4 in hand 6 (which seems to be their standard raise size)\n- In hand 6, they showed aggression postflop with bets on flop and turn\n\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 is a tight-aggressive player who raises with strong hands. Their raise from MP likely indicates a strong range (AJ+, KQ+, 88+).\n\n**Hand analysis**:\n- K9o is a marginal hand, especially when facing a raise\n- It's dominated by many hands in a tight player's raising range (AK, KQ, KJ)\n- We have position, which helps\n- 113 BB deep, so we have room to play postflop\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: K9o is weak against a tight raiser's range\n2. **Position**: Button is good, we can act last postflop\n3. **Opponent**: Tight player raising from MP = strong range\n4. **Stack depth**: Deep enough to play speculative hands, but K9o doesn't have great implied odds\n5. **Tournament**: Early stage, no pressure yet\n\nI think calling is marginal at best. K9o is likely dominated too often. Folding is reasonable. \n\nHowever, since we're on the button with a deep stack, and facing a min-raise (2x BB), we could consider calling to see a flop in position. But given how tight MiniMax-M2 is, I'm more inclined to fold this dominated hand.\n\nLet me reconsider - the raise is only to 4 (2x BB), so it's a min-raise. We're getting 2.75:1 pot odds. With position and depth, calling might be okay, but it's still marginal.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes, this is still early tournament. I think the best play is to **fold**. K9o is just too weak against a tight player's raising range, and we don't want to get dominated.\n\nWait, let me think again. We're on the BUTTON. Position is huge. The raise is small (2x). We have a deep stack. K9o can hit some good flops (Kxx, 9x, straight draws). Maybe calling is okay?\n\nBut fundamentally, K9o is a trash hand against a tight raiser. When we hit a K, we're often dominated. When we hit a 9, it's not great. The straight potential is limited.\n\nI think the correct play is to **fold**. We can find better spots against this tight player.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket Kings (Ks Kc) in UTG position. This is the second-best starting hand in Texas Hold'em. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket Kings is an extremely strong hand, only behind pocket Aces. I should almost always play this hand aggressively.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in UTG (Under the Gun), which is the earliest position. This means I'll be out of position post-flop against most opponents. However, with such a strong hand, this is less concerning.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 226 chips (113 BB), which is a healthy stack. I can afford to play aggressively and build a pot.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the limited data I have:\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB) has folded in recent hands\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB) has raised to 4 chips in a previous hand\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) raised to 12 chips in one hand and folded to a raise in another\n   - The other Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has folded recently\n\n5. **Current Action**: It's 2 chips to call. I should definitely not fold. The question is whether to call or raise.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With a strong hand like KK, I want to build the pot and extract value. I also want to thin the field since being out of position with multiple callers is not ideal.\n\nGiven that I'm in early position with a premium hand, I should raise to:\n- Build the pot for value\n- Get information about opponents' hands\n- Thin the field\n- Take control of the hand\n\nA standard raise would be 3-4x the big blind. Since the BB is 2 chips, a raise to 6-8 chips would be appropriate. Given I'm in early position and want to charge opponents to see the flop, I'll go with a slightly larger raise.\n\nLet me raise to 8 chips (4x the BB). This is a solid, standard raise that builds the pot while still being able to fold if I face significant resistance (like a re-raise from a very tight player who might have Aces).\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I'm in UTG with Kings - this is a spot where I want to maximize value. A raise to 6-8 chips seems appropriate. I'll go with 8 chips to charge premiums and build the pot.",

This is an extremely strong hand.\n\nLet me think about the action:\n- Preflop: I raised to 8, Seat 2 called\n- Seat 2 is the only opponent left\n\nLooking at Seat 2's history from the tool:\n- Very tight player - has folded preflop most hands (hands 3-11)\n- Only raised preflop in hands 1 and 2 (both times)\n- In hand 2, they raised preflop but folded on the flop\n\nThis suggests Seat 2 is a tight-aggressive player who likely has a strong hand to call my preflop raise. Given the board texture (Ad Jd Kd), they could have:\n- An Ace (top pair)\n- A Jack (second pair)\n- A flush draw with diamonds\n- Straight draw with Q-T\n- Possibly two pair or a set\n\nMy set of Kings is currently the nuts (best possible hand) unless they have pocket Aces (which would give them a set of Aces). The board is somewhat coordinated with two diamonds and straight possibilities.\n\nGiven that I have a monster hand and want to extract value:\n1. I should definitely bet/raise here\n2. I want to build the pot while I'm likely ahead\n3. I need to charge any flush draws or straight draws\n4. The opponent is tight, so they likely have something decent\n\nSince the amount to call is 0, I can check or raise. Checking might induce a bet from them if they have something, but betting myself is better because:\n- I have a strong hand and want to build the pot\n- The board is somewhat draw-heavy (flush draw, straight draw)\n- I can get value from top pair, two pair, or draws\n\nMinimum raise is 6 chips. Given the pot is 19, a bet of around 12-16 chips would be appropriate (2/3 to 3/4 pot).\n\nLet me make a solid value bet here.",

The fact that they called my preflop raise and called on the flop suggests they have something decent.\n\nLet me think about the board and my hand:\n- I have Ks Kc (pocket Kings)\n- Board: Ad Jc Kd 5c\n- I have a set of Kings (three of a kind)\n\nThis is a very strong hand! The only hand that beats me right now is:\n- Pocket Aces (but there's an Ace on the board, so they would have had Aces preflop)\n- Or they could have made a straight with Q-10 (but that seems unlikely given their tight play)\n\nGiven the board texture:\n- There's a flush draw possibility (clubs: Jc, 5c, and I have Ks so no club)\n- There's also a potential straight draw with Q-10\n- But my set of Kings is very strong\n\nThe pot is 51 chips, and I have 202 chips. I should definitely bet for value here. My opponent has shown they call with decent hands, and they've been tight, so if they call my flop bet, they likely have something.\n\nSince there's no bet to me (amount to call is 0), I should bet. The minimum raise is 16, but that's just the minimum - I should bet more for value.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing:\n- Pot is 51\n- I could bet 30-40 chips (60-80% pot) to get value from hands like:\n  - AJ (top pair)\n  - AQ (top pair)\n  - KQ (two pair)\n  - Any flush draws\n  - Any straight draws\n\nGiven how tight my opponent has been, they're likely to have a strong hand that can call a decent sized bet.\n\nI'll go with a bet of around 35-40 chips for value.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I have a very strong hand - I have a set of Kings (Ks Kc) on a board of Ad Jc Kd 5c 3c. This gives me three Kings. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have SET of Kings (K-K-K). This is extremely strong. The board shows Ad Jc Kd 5c 3c. The only hands that beat me are:\n   - A-A (set of Aces) - very unlikely given the action\n   - J-J (set of Jacks) - possible but unlikely\n   - K-K (we have both Kings, so impossible)\n   - A-K (two pair) - we beat this\n   - Any straight? No, the board is not connected enough for a straight\n   - Any flush? The board has 3 clubs (Jc, 5c, 3c), so a flush is possible if opponent has two clubs\n\n2. **Action History**:\n   - Preflop: I raised to 8, opponent called\n   - Flop: I bet 16, opponent called\n   - Turn: I bet 40, opponent called\n   - River: I'm first to act (BB)\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: Looking at the opponent's history, Seat 2 has been very tight - folding preflop in hands 3-11. They only played hands 1 and 2. In hand 2, they raised preflop but folded on the flop. This suggests they're a tight player who only plays strong hands.\n\n4. **Pot Size**: The pot is 131 chips. My stack is 162 chips.\n\n5. **Board Texture**: There are 3 clubs on board, so a flush is possible. Also, there's an Ace and Jack, so two pair combinations like A-J, A-K, J-K are possible.\n\nGiven that my opponent has called two streets of betting (flop and turn), they likely have something. The fact that they've been very tight suggests they have a real hand. Possible hands they could have:\n- A-x (top pair)\n- J-x (second pair)\n- Two pair (A-J, A-K, J-K)\n- A flush draw that hit on the river\n- A set of Aces or Jacks\n- K-x (but we have both Kings)\n\nSince I'm out of position and my opponent has shown strength by calling twice, I should check here. If I bet and they have a flush or a better hand, I could lose a lot. If I check, I can see what they do - if they bet, I can evaluate based on the size.\n\nActually, wait. I have a very strong hand. The pot is 131 and I have 162 left. Let me reconsider:\n\n- If I check and they have a missed draw, they might check back and I lose value\n- If I bet, I can get value from worse hands\n\nGiven the opponent is tight and has called twice, they likely have at least top pair or a draw that hit. But my hand is VERY strong - only losing to sets of Aces or Jacks, or a flush.\n\nI think checking is too passive. I should bet for value. \n\nI'll carefully consider the betting strategy. With a pot-sized bet around 131 chips, I need to balance extracting value and protecting my stack. A strategic bet of 60-80 chips could maximize my potential winnings while managing risk. This approach allows me to get value from strong but inferior hands, while keeping some flexibility if the opponent shows unexpected strength.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent MiniMax-M2 has a pattern:\n- They frequently fold preflop (11 out of 19 actions were folds)\n- When they do enter pots, they tend to be aggressive post-flop (they bet on flop in hands 2, 3, and 6)\n- They raised preflop in hand 6 and then continued betting on flop and turn\n- In hand 11 they raised preflop but we don't have postflop data\n\nIn this current hand, they just called preflop (limp), which is unusual for them. This suggests they might have a medium-strength hand or a speculative hand.\n\nMy hand: Kd 6d\nBoard: Kc Jc 9h\n\nI have top pair with a weak kicker (K6). The board is very coordinated with two clubs and a straight draw possibility (Q-T would make a straight). There are many hands that could beat me or have strong draws:\n- Any K with a better kicker (KJ, K9, KQ, KT, etc.)\n- Sets (JJ, 99)\n- Two pairs (KJ, K9, J9)\n- Flush draws (any two clubs)\n- Straight draws (QT, T8, Q8)\n\nSince MiniMax-M2 limped preflop and I checked, they're now facing a decision. The pot is 5 chips. I have the option to check or bet.\n\nGiven the coordinated board and my weak kicker, I should be cautious. Checking allows me to:\n1. Control the pot size with a marginal hand\n2. See what MiniMax-M2 does - if they bet, I can evaluate based on their sizing\n3. Potentially improve on the turn (though I only have 3 outs to improve my kicker - the remaining 6s)\n\nA bet would be a protection bet, but against this opponent who tends to be aggressive when they enter pots, a check might be better to induce a bluff or keep the pot small.\n\nI think checking is the best play here.",

The small bet size of 2 into a pot of 7 (less than 30%) suggests either a weak bet or a probe bet.\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- I have top pair (Kings) with a weak kicker (6)\n- There are many draws on this board:\n  - Club flush draw (Kc, Jc on board)\n  - Straight draws (Q-T, T-8, Q-8)\n- My hand is vulnerable to many turn cards\n\n**Position and stack:**\n- I'm in BB with 291 chips (145.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- I have position on the opponent (they act first)\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Pot odds**: Getting 3.5:1, I only need ~22% equity to call\n2. **Hand strength**: Top pair but vulnerable\n3. **Opponent**: Tight player making a small bet - could be weak or could be probing\n4. **Board texture**: Very wet - many turn cards are bad for me\n5. **Tournament**: Early stage, no ICM pressure\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too weak, I have top pair and good pot odds\n- **Call**: Reasonable, see a turn card and re-evaluate\n- **Raise**: Could be good to charge draws and find out where I stand, but risks building a big pot with a marginal hand\n\nI think calling is the best option. I have top pair and good pot odds. The opponent's small bet suggests weakness or a draw. I want to keep the pot small with my marginal hand but I can't fold getting these odds. I'll call and see what the turn brings.\n\nLet me make the call.",

My kicker is 6d.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They frequently fold preflop (hands 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13)\n- When they do play, they tend to:\n  - Call preflop (hands 2, 3, 6)\n  - Bet on flop/turn (hands 2, 3, 6)\n  - In hand 6, they raised preflop, bet flop 8, bet turn 8, then checked river\n\nSo MiniMax-M2 is somewhat aggressive when they do play, but they fold a lot preflop. The board has a flush draw (3 clubs). I have trips with a weak kicker.\n\nGiven the board texture:\n- There are 3 Kings on board, so I have trips\n- Possible straight draws (Q-T would make a straight)\n- Possible flush draw (3 clubs)\n- My kicker is weak (6d)\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2 bet 2 on the flop and I called.

The board is paired with Kc-Kh, and there are potential flush and straight draws that may have missed or completed.\n\nLet me review the hand action:\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called 2 (limped in)\n- Flop: I checked, MiniMax-M2 bet 2, I called\n- Turn: I bet 8, MiniMax-M2 called\n- River: I can check or bet\n\nThe opponent's action pattern (from the recall):\n- MiniMax-M2 has been relatively tight, folding preflop many times\n- When they do play, they tend to bet aggressively postflop (bet 2 on flop in hand 3, bet 2 on turn in hand 3)\n- In hand 6, they raised preflop, bet 8 on flop, bet 8 on turn, then checked river\n- They seem to be a straightforward player who bets with strength and checks when weak\n\n**Current situation analysis:**\n1. **My hand strength:** I have trip Kings, which is very strong. Only hands beating me are:\n   - KJ (full house)\n   - KK (quads - unlikely since I have Kd)\n   - Any pocket pair that made a full house (99, JJ)\n   - A hand like K9 or KJ would have me beat\n\n2. **Opponent's range:** \n   - They limped preflop, so unlikely to have premium pairs\n   - They bet the flop for 2 into a pot of 5 (40% pot)\n   - They called my turn bet of 8\n   - This suggests they have something - could be a King with weaker kicker, a flush draw, straight draw, or maybe a Jack\n\n3. **Board texture:**\n   - Two clubs on flop (Kc Jc), one club on river (4c) - flush possible\n   - Straight draws possible with Q-T, but no 8 or T on board to complete\n   - The 4c on river could complete a flush for someone holding two clubs\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies:**\n   - From the recall, MiniMax-M2 tends to bet when they have something\n   - They called my turn bet, suggesting they have some strength\n   - They haven't shown any bluffing tendencies\n\n5. **Decision:** I should bet for value here. I have trip Kings which is likely the best hand. I need to extract value from:\n   - Weaker Kings (Kx)\n   - Jacks (trip Jacks)\n   - Maybe 9s (trip 9s)\n   - Missed flush draws that might call a small bet\n\nThe pot is 25 chips. A value bet of around 50-60% pot (12-15 chips) seems appropriate. This allows weaker hands to call while protecting against the flush.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing. Since I can raise to minimum 8, but that's too small. I should bet around 15-20 chips for value. The minimum raise is 8, but I can raise to any amount above that. I'll bet 15 chips which is 60% of pot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: SB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: Js 6s (Jacks of spades, 6 of spades)\n- Stack: 305 chips (152.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 5 chips\n- Amount to call: 1 chip\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Table dynamics:**\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has called 2 chips (only player besides me still in)\n- Everyone else folded\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- Js 6s is a speculative hand - suited one-gapper\n- In SB, I'm out of position for the rest of the hand\n- This is a marginal hand at best\n\n**Opponent analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the search results, I can see GPT-OSS-120B's patterns:\n- Hand 5: Folded to my raise\n- Hand 6: Folded to MiniMax-M2's raise\n- Hand 7: Raised to 8 (won without showdown)\n- Hand 8: Folded to DeepSeek-V3.2's raise\n- Hand 9: Called 1 in BB, then checked down (lost to my 9s8c)\n- Hand 10: Raised to 12 (everyone folded)\n- Hand 11: Folded to MiniMax-M2's raise\n- Hand 12: Folded to my raise with KK\n- Hand 13: Called 4, bet 8 on flop, folded on turn\n- Hand 14: Folded\n\nPattern: GPT-OSS-120B seems to play somewhat tight. They raise with strong hands (like in hands 7, 10) but also call sometimes (hand 9, 13). In this hand, they just called 2, which could mean:\n- Medium strength hand\n- Trying to see a flop cheaply\n- Not super strong (would likely raise)\n\n**My decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Js6s is weak, especially OOP\n2. **Position**: I'll be OOP postflop, which is bad for a marginal hand\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 1 to win 5 (5:1 odds) - decent odds\n4. **Implied odds**: With suited cards, there's some potential if I hit a flush\n5. **Stack size**: I have a big stack (152.5 BB), so calling 1 chip is trivial\n6. **Tournament**: Early stage, no pressure\n\n**Conclusion**: While Js6s is weak, the pot odds are good (5:1), I'm getting a discount in the SB, and the investment is tiny relative to my stack. I have suited cards with some potential. However, I'll be OOP which is a significant disadvantage.\n\nGiven that GPT-OSS-120B just called (rather than raised), they likely don't have a premium hand. This makes it slightly more attractive to see a flop.\n\nI think calling is slightly better than folding here. The price is right, and while I'll be OOP, the stack preservation cost is minimal. I could also consider raising to try to take it down now, but that's risky with a weak hand OOP.\n\nLet me just call and see the flop.",

So I need a K or a 9 to make a straight. That's a gutshot straight draw (4 outs).\n- For the flush: I have Js 6s, and there's Qs on board. So I need two more spades. There are 13 spades in the deck total. I have 2, board has 1, so 10 spades left. So I have a flush draw.\n\nActually, wait. Let me recalculate. I have Js and 6s. The board has Qs.

They called preflop with position on us.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 6 chips, I can check for free. If I bet, minimum raise is 2 chips.\n\n**Hand strength:**\nI have a flush draw (9 outs out of 46 unknown cards = ~19.6% chance to hit on river). This is a decent draw but not the nut flush (someone could have As or Ks). Also, the board is paired (two 7s), which means someone could have a full house already.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in SB, which is out of position. There are two players behind me (BB with 126 chips, and Seat 5 with 179 chips).\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that:\n1. I have a decent flush draw (9 outs)\n2. It's checked to me and I can see a free card\n3. I'm out of position against two players\n4. The board is paired, reducing the value of my flush\n5. I have no fold equity by betting since opponents have shown passive tendencies\n\n\n6. Checking is free, so I can realize my equity without risk\n\nI'll take the cautious approach and check. This allows me to see the river card without investing additional chips, preserving my tournament stack while maintaining the potential to complete my flush draw. The free card gives me a chance to improve my hand without unnecessary risk.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river decision step by step:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I have Js 6s on the button\n- Board: 7h Qs Th 7s Ac\n- Pot: 10 chips\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) bet 4 on the river\n- I need to call 4 to see showdown\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**My hand evaluation:**\n- Js 6s - I have a flush draw that missed\n- Final board: 7h Qs Th 7s Ac\n- I have: Jack high\n- No pair, no straight, no flush\n- This is a very weak hand\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the opponent actions I can see:\n- Seat 2 has been very tight preflop (lots of folds)\n- They only played hands #1, #2, and #12\n- In hand #12 they called all the way to the river then folded\n- They just bet on the river in this hand after checking all previous streets\n\n**The action in this hand:**\n- Preflop: Seat 5 called, I called, Seat 2 checked (big blind)\n- Flop: All three players checked (7h Qs Th)\n- Turn: All three players checked (7s)\n- River: I checked, Seat 2 bet 4, Seat 5 folded\n\n**Analysis:**\nThe board is 7h Qs Th 7s Ac - there are two pairs on board (7s and Qs/Ts), and a possible flush. \n\nSeat 2's pattern suggests they're tight. They've checked all streets then suddenly bet the river. This is often a value bet with a made hand. The fact that Seat 5 folded suggests they didn't have much either.\n\nI only have Jack high. Even if my opponent is bluffing, my Jack high might not be good. They could have:\n- Any Ace (they have me beat)\n- Any Queen or Ten (they have me beat)\n- Any 7 (they have trips)\n- Any pocket pair\n- A missed flush draw that still beats me\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 to win 14 (10 pot + 4 bet), so 3.5:1 odds. I need to win ~22% of the time to break even.\n \nI can't justify calling with just Jack high against a tight player's river bet. The lack of bluffing opportunities and my weak hand make folding the most sensible choice. The opponent's consistent checking and sudden river bet strongly suggest they have a real hand, making my chances of winning extremely slim.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - great position\n- Cards: 6s 6h - pocket sixes, a medium pair\n- Stack: 304 chips (152 BB) - very healthy stack\n- Pot: 13 chips\n- Blinds: 1/2\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): posted 1\n- Seat 3 (BB): posted 2  \n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): raised to 4\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): raised to 6\n\nSo I need to call 6 to see the flop. The minimum raise would be to 8.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n\n**Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2):**\n- Recent preflop actions: fold, fold, raise(4), fold, fold, call(2), bet(2), call(8), fold, fold\n- Seems tight, raises occasionally to small amounts\n- Their raise to 4 here is a min-raise from UTG+1 position\n- They showed down Qs Ks previously (strong hand)\n\n**Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B):**\n- Recent preflop actions: fold, call(4), bet(8), check, fold, fold, call(2), check, check, fold\n- Also relatively tight, but more active than Seat 4\n- Their raise to 6 here is a small re-raise (3x the BB)\n- They showed down As 5h previously (ace-rag suited)\n\n**My Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket sixes is a medium pair. It's vulnerable to overcards but has good potential against 1-2 opponents. On the button, I have position advantage.\n\n2. **Action**: There's been a raise and a re-raise. This suggests at least one of them has a real hand. The raises are small (4 and 6), which could indicate:\n   - Strong hands trying to build a pot\n   - Medium strength hands probing\n   - Light 3-bets\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 6 to win 13. That's about 2.17:1 pot odds. This is marginal for pocket sixes in a multi-way pot with action.\n\n4. **Implied Odds**: If I hit a set (about 1 in 8.5 chance), I could win a big pot. With 304 chips, I have deep stacks relative to the bet.\n\n5. **Opponent Tendencies**: Both opponents seem relatively tight based on their histories. The small raise sizes might indicate they're not super strong, but I can't be certain.\n\n6. **Position**: Being on the button is excellent. I'll act last on all postflop streets.\n\n7. **Tournament Consideration**: My stack is healthy at 152 BB. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position.\n\n**Decision**: With pocket sixes on the button, facing two small raises, I think calling is the best play. Raising would be too aggressive with a medium pair facing action, and folding is too tight given my position, hand potential, and stack depth. I want to see the flop in position and evaluate.\n\nThe call is 6 chips which is only 2% of my stack - very manageable. If I hit a set, I can potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold to further aggression.",

A medium pair, good for set mining.\n\n**Position:** Button (BTN) - Excellent position, last to act postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 298 chips (149 BB) - Deep stack relative to blinds.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Pot is 47 chips\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 4, then re-raised to 8 after Seat 5's raise to 6\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6, then raised to 30\n- I called the initial raise to 6\n- Now I need to call 24 more (30 - 6 = 24) to see the flop\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):**\n- Shows a pattern of folding preflop frequently (folded in hands 9, 10, 12, 13, 15)\n- Only raised preflop in hand 11 (amount 4)\n- Called in hand 14, then bet flop, called turn, folded river\n- Showed down KQs in hand 6\n- Seems relatively tight/passive\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5):**\n- More active than Seat 4\n- Called in hands 13 and 15\n- Made a flop bet in hand 13 then folded on turn\n- Showed down A5s in hand 9\n- Seems capable of making moves\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 66 is a set-mining hand. I need to hit a set (about 12% chance on flop) to feel confident.\n2. **Pot odds:** Need to call 24 to win 47 = ~51% pot odds. This is not good for a set-mining hand that hits only 12% of the time.\n3. **Implied odds:** If I hit my set, I could win a big pot. Both opponents have shown they can put chips in.\n4. **Position:** Being on the button is great - I can control the action postflop.\n5. **Action:** There's been a 3-bet and 4-bet sequence. Seat 5's raise to 30 is significant (15 BB).\n6. **Stack preservation:** I have a healthy stack. Calling 24 chips would leave me with 274 chips, which is still good.\n\n**Decision:** This is a fold. The pot odds are terrible for set mining (need about 8:1 implied odds minimum, getting less than 2:1 immediate). While I have position, the 4-bet to 30 suggests real strength from Seat 5. With 66, I'm likely dominated by higher pairs or flipping against overcards. The risk isn't worth it.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I already invested 6 chips. The pot is 47, I need to call 24 more. That's about 2:1 pot odds. For set mining, I need much better implied odds. The 4-bet suggests strong hands. Even though I'm on the button, 66 doesn't play well against the range that 4-bets to 30. I should fold and preserve my chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my hand, I have Qd 3d - a very weak hand from UTG position. This is definitely a fold in most situations.\n\nKey factors:\n1. Hand strength: Q3s is extremely weak, even suited. It's dominated by many hands and has very poor playability postflop.\n2. Position: UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act on every street and have no information about opponents' intentions.\n3. Stack size: I have 298 chips (149 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take risks.\n4. Opponent tendencies: From the recall, I can see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 has been aggressive (raised preflop in hand 16, made big bets)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been very aggressive (re-raised multiple times in hand 16)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 folded to a raise in hand 16\n   - Kimi-K2 folded to a raise in hand 16\n\nThis suggests there are aggressive players behind me who could easily raise if I limp in. Even calling the 2-chip big blind is dangerous because I could face a raise and have to fold, losing chips unnecessarily.\n\nThe only consideration is that I have a suited hand (diamonds), which gives me some slim potential for a flush. But the chances of hitting a flush are very low (about 6.5% on the flop), and even if I do hit, I could be dominated by higher diamonds.\n\nFrom UTG with a weak hand like Q3s against aggressive opponents, this is an easy fold. I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots.",

KTo is a hand that can be:\n1. Folded - safest play, avoids tough postflop spots OOP\n2. Called - cheap price, deep stack, can hit strong hands\n3. 3-bet - could work as a bluff/semi-bluff but risky OOP\n\nGiven:\n- MiniMax seems to raise frequently, so their range is likely wide\n- The price is very cheap (2 chips to call)\n- I have position disadvantage but deep stack to realize equity\n- KTo has decent equity against wide ranges\n\nI think calling is reasonable here. I'm getting good pot odds, have a deep stack, and KTo can flop well (top pair, straight draws). The opponent seems active enough that they could be raising with many worse hands.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious postflop and ready to fold if I don't hit something strong.\n\nLet me make the call.",

The board is coordinated and my opponent is aggressive. I should not be betting here with King high. Checking is the only reasonable option. I need to see if they bet and decide based on their sizing, but with no pair and no draw, I'm ready to fold to any significant bet.\n\nI should check and see what my opponent does. If they bet small, I might consider calling with my King high and backdoor draws, but I'm likely just giving up on this hand.",

A weak hand trying to see where they stand\n  2. A strong hand trying to extract value\n  3. A continuation bet with air\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 11, I need to call 2\n- Getting 5.5:1 odds\n- With King-high, I'm likely behind but the odds are good\n\n**Decision:**\nI have nothing but King-high. The board is coordinated (9-5-6 could connect with many hands). However, the bet is very small (2 into 11), giving me great pot odds. I should probably fold because:\n1. I have no pair, no draw\n2. The board is somewhat coordinated\n3. Even though odds are good, I'm likely drawing dead or need to hit a K\n\n\n4. I don't want to build a pot with such a weak hand\n\nI'll fold this hand, preserving my stack for better opportunities. The minimal pot odds don't justify continuing with such a weak holding against an opponent showing strength.",

This is a standard raise size. Given their tight folding pattern, when they do raise, they likely have a strong hand.\n\nMy hand: 9s 8s\n- Suited connector, decent potential but not strong\n- On the button, so I have position\n- My stack is 292 chips (146 BB), very healthy\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 to win 14 (8+6), so about 3.5:1 or ~28.6% equity needed.\n\nAgainst a tight opponent's raising range (likely strong hands like pocket pairs, big aces, big broadway hands), 98s has roughly 30-35% equity, which makes it borderline profitable to call given position and implied odds.\n\nHowever, I should consider:\n1. This is a tournament, I want to preserve my stack but also accumulate\n2. I have position which is valuable\n3. Suited connectors play well in position\n4. The opponent is tight but not extremely aggressive\n5. I can easily fold if I miss the flop\n\nGiven my position, stack depth, and the opponent's tight but not maniacal raising pattern, calling seems reasonable.

That's approximately 16% chance to hit on the turn (8/47). With backdoor flush draw, I have some additional equity.\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm in position (button)\n- Opponent seems tight and has shown willingness to fold\n- I have a strong draw\n- Pot is small (12 chips)\n- Checking gives a free card but I lose initiative\n\nI think a small semi-bluff raise is appropriate here to:\n1. Take control of the hand\n2. Apply pressure to a tight opponent\n3. Potentially win the pot immediately\n\n\n4. Build the pot for when I hit my draw\n\nI'll carefully consider the optimal bet sizing to maximize pressure while minimizing risk. A strategic raise of around 8 chips could effectively represent strength and potentially force my opponent to fold their marginal hands. This approach balances aggression with pot control, giving me multiple ways to win the hand.\n\nThe key is to apply just enough pressure to make my opponent uncomfortable without overcommitting my stack. By raising to 8, I'm signaling strength while keeping my options open for future streets.",

          "reasoning_content": "  This is a tournament situation. Let me analyze the current hand:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- My hand: 9s 8s (9 of spades, 8 of spades)\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- My stack: 280 chips (140 BB)\n- Board: Ts Jc 4h 3c\n- Pot: 28 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the button (position is good)\n- I have 9-8 suited (originally spades, but board has Ts so my flush draw is gone)\n- The board shows: Ts Jc 4h 3c\n- So I have: 9s 8s\n- Board: Ts Jc 4h 3c\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have an open-ended straight draw: I need a Q or a 7 to complete a straight (7-8-9-T-J or 8-9-T-J-Q)\n- I have 8 outs (4 Queens, 4 Sevens)\n- However, if a Q comes, someone might have K-Q for a higher straight\n- The Ts on board means my spade flush draw is dead (I can't make a flush)\n- I have no pair, just a straight draw\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 28 chips\n- If I bet, minimum raise is 8 chips\n- I have 8 outs out of 46 unknown cards = ~17.4% chance to hit on river\n- Pot odds if I bet 8: 28:8 or 3.5:1, which means I need ~22% equity to break even\n- My actual equity is ~17.4%, so mathematically I don't have enough equity for a value bet\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n- Opponent is Kimi-K2 in seat 2 (BB)\n- They have 120 chips (60 BB)\n- Looking at their history: They fold a LOT preflop, but when they do play, they seem to call down\n- In hand 12, they called flop and turn, then folded river\n- In hand 15, they checked down and bet small on river\n- In hand 17, they raised preflop to 6 (which is what they did this hand)\n\n**Current action:**\n- Preflop: I called their raise (they raised to 6, I called)\n- Flop: I bet 8, they called\n- Turn: It's checked to me, I can check or raise\n\n**My thought process:**\n1. I have a straight draw with 8 outs\n2. The pot is 28 chips\n3. I have position (on the button)\n4. My opponent has been passive/calling station tendencies\n5. I don't have enough equity to value bet the turn\n\n\n6. Checking is the most strategic move here. I'll preserve my chips, maintain control, and potentially see a free river card that could complete my straight. This approach minimizes risk while keeping my options open for a potential river play.",

          "content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN (Seat 1) with 9s 8s\n- Stack: 280 chips (140 BB)\n- Board: Ts Jc 4h 3c Ad\n- Pot: 28 chips\n- It's on the river, and action is on me\n- I can check or raise (no one has bet yet on the river)\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have 9s 8s - no pair, just a missed straight draw\n- The board shows: Ts Jc 4h 3c Ad\n- This gives me absolutely nothing - I don't even have a pair\n- The board has an Ace, Jack, Ten, Four, Three - all different suits\n- Best hand I could make is Ace-high with my 9 kicker\n\n**Action history:**\n- Preflop: I called from SB, opponent raised to 6, I called\n- Flop: I bet 8, opponent called\n- Turn: I checked, opponent checked\n- River: Action is on me\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 120 chips left\n- They called my flop bet but checked the turn\n- This suggests they might have something but not a strong hand\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check - Showdown with my Ace-high\n2. Bet/Raise - Try to bluff them off a hand\n\n**Key considerations:**\n- I have absolutely no showdown value (Ace-high with 9 kicker)\n- The Ace on the river is scary for many hands\n- If they had a strong hand (like a pair of Jacks or Tens), they might have bet the turn\n- Their turn check suggests weakness\n- I have position and can represent the Ace\n- Pot is 28 chips, I could make a small value bet or bluff\n\nLet me think about what hands they could have:\n- They could have a Jack (AJ, KJ, QJ, Jx) - but would they check turn?\n- They could have a Ten (AT, KT, QT) - but again, might bet turn\n- They could have a pocket pair (66-QQ) - checking turn makes sense\n- They could have a missed draw - checking turn makes sense\n\nGiven that they called the flop but checked the turn, they likely have a marginal hand or a draw that missed. The Ace on the river is a great bluff card.\n\nSince I have no showdown value, I should either:\n1. Check and give up (conservative)\n2. Make a small bluff bet to try to win the pot\n\nGiven it's a tournament and I have a healthy stack, I could try a small bluff here. A bet of around 15-20 chips could be enough to make them fold marginal hands.\n\nBut wait, let me reconsider - I have Ace-high. If they have a worse Ace (like A2-A8), I might actually be ahead. But it's more likely they have some pair or better.\n\nActually, looking at the board again: Ts Jc 4h 3c Ad\n- If they have any pair (44, JJ, TT), they beat me\n- If they have any Ace, they beat me (unless it's A2-A8, but then we're splitting or they win)\n- If they have King-high, I win\n- If they have Queen-high, I win\n\nThe problem is most hands that called the flop and checked turn are either:\n1. Marginal pairs (44, 66-99, maybe JJ/TT)\n2. Draws that missed\n3. Ace-high that they're trying to showdown\n\nIf I bet, I might fold out:\n- Missed draws\n- Some weaker pairs\n- Ace-high hands\n\nBut I might get called by:\n- Any pair\n- Any Ace\n\nGiven the pot is 28, I could make a small bluff of maybe 16-20 chips. But is it worth it?\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. I have position and the opponent showed weakness on the turn. The Ace is a great scare card. If they had an Ace, they might have bet the turn. If they have a pair, the Ace is scary.\n\nBut I have literally nothing. Ace-high with 9 kicker is not winning at showdown often enough to justify checking. \n\nI think the best play is to check. Here's why:\n1. I have some showdown value with Ace-high\n2. A bluff might not work often enough to be profitable\n3. The opponent called the flop, so they have something\n4. It's a small pot, not worth risking chips\n5. If I check and they have nothing, I might win anyway\n\nWait, but I have 9-high, not Ace-high! The board has an Ace, but I don't have an Ace in my hand. I have 9s"

Check and lose at showdown (since I have 9-high)\n2. Make a bluff bet to try to win the pot\n\nGiven the Ace on the river is a scare card, and my opponent checked both turn and river, showing weakness, a bluff could work. However, they called the flop bet, so they likely have something.\n\nSince I have zero showdown value, I need to either bluff or give up. The pot is 28 chips. \n\nActually, wait - I need to reconsider. If I bet and get called, I lose the bet. If I check, I lose the pot. Since I have 9-high, I cannot win at showdown. So checking is just giving up.\n\nA small bluff might be worth it. The opponent showed weakness by checking turn and river. The Ace is scary. I could bet around 16-20 chips.\n\nBut let me think about the opponent's stack. They have 120 chips left. A bet of 16-20 chips is meaningful but not huge.\n\nHowever, without any specific reads on this opponent, and given that they called the flop, I think the conservative play is to check and give up. Bluffing without any equity or reads is generally not profitable.\n\nActually, I just realized - I have position and my opponent has shown weakness by checking twice (turn and river). This is a good spot to bluff. Since I have no showdown value, I should either bluff or fold (check-fold).\n\nGiven the Ace is a scare card and the opponent checked twice, I think a small bluff is appropriate. I'll bet around 16 chips (just over half pot) to try to take it down.\n\nWait, but the minimum raise is 8 chips. So I could bet as little as 8 chips or more. A small bet of 8-12 chips might look like a value bet and could get folds from hands that are beating me.\n\nLet me reconsider again. I have 9-high. I literally cannot win unless I bluff. The opponent:\n- Raised preflop (showing strength)\n- Called my flop bet (has something)\n- Checked turn (weakness)\n- Checked river (weakness)\n\nThe turn and river checks suggest they don't have a strong hand. The Ace on the river is scary. This is actually a decent bluff spot.\n\nI'll make a small bet that looks like a value bet. Something like 12-16 chips.\n\nActually, you know what, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me check what hands I lose to:\n- Any pair (44, 66-QQ)\n- Any Ace\n- Any two cards that make a pair with the board\n\nAnd I only beat:\n- Complete air (which might just check back anyway)\n- King-high, Queen-high (unlikely to call flop)\n\nSince the opponent called the flop, they likely have at least some pair or draw. The turn check suggests the draw missed or they have a weak pair. The river Ace is scary to weak pairs.\n\nBut I think the most prudent play here, without reads, is to just check and give up. It's not worth risking chips in this spot.\n\nWait, I need to make a decision. Let me think about this differently. If I check, I lose 100% of the time. If I bet, I might win some percentage of the time. What size should I bet?\n\nGiven the pot is 28, a bet of 14 (half pot) or less could work. But I need to think about what the opponent has. They raised preflop, so they could have:\n- Big pairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT) - but would check turn and river?\n- AK, AQ, AJ, AT - but would check turn and river?\n- Medium pairs (99-77) - possible\n- Suited connectors - possible\n\nActually, if they had a big hand, they'd likely bet turn or river. The checks suggest weakness. \n\nI think I should make a small bluff here. Let me bet 12 chips. This is less than half pot and might get folds from marginal hands.\n\nBut wait - the minimum raise is 8 chips, and I can raise to any amount 8 or higher. So betting 12 is fine.\n\nActually, I'm going to be conservative here. Without specific reads that this opponent can fold marginal hands, I'll check and give up. It's not worth the risk.\n\nNo wait"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN (Seat 1) with 9s 8s\n- Stack: 280 chips (140 BB)\n- Board: Ts Jc 4h 3c Ad\n- Pot: 28 chips\n- It's on the river, and action is on me\n- I can check or raise (no one has bet yet on the river)\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have 9s 8s - no pair, just a missed straight draw\n- The board shows: Ts Jc 4h 3c Ad\n- This gives me absolutely nothing - I don't even have a pair\n- The board has an Ace, Jack, Ten, Four, Three - all different suits\n- Best hand I could make is Ace-high with my 9 kicker\n\n**Action history:**\n- Preflop: I called from SB, opponent raised to 6, I called\n- Flop: I bet 8, opponent called\n- Turn: I checked, opponent checked\n- River: Action is on me\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 120 chips left\n- They called my flop bet but checked the turn\n- This suggests they might have something but not a strong hand\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check - Showdown with my Ace-high\n2. Bet/Raise - Try to bluff them off a hand\n\n**Key considerations:**\n- I have absolutely no showdown value (Ace-high with 9 kicker)\n- The Ace on the river is scary for many hands\n- If they had a strong hand (like a pair of Jacks or Tens), they might have bet the turn\n- Their turn check suggests weakness\n- I have position and can represent the Ace\n- Pot is 28 chips, I could make a small value bet or bluff\n\nLet me think about what hands they could have:\n- They could have a Jack (AJ, KJ, QJ, Jx) - but would they check turn?\n- They could have a Ten (AT, KT, QT) - but again, might bet turn\n- They could have a pocket pair (66-QQ) - checking turn makes sense\n- They could have a missed draw - checking turn makes sense\n\nGiven that they called the flop but checked the turn, they likely have a marginal hand or a draw that missed. The Ace on the river is a great bluff card.\n\nSince I have no showdown value, I should either:\n1. Check and give up (conservative)\n2. Make a small bluff bet to try to win the pot\n\nGiven it's a tournament and I have a healthy stack, I could try a small bluff here. A bet of around 15-20 chips could be enough to make them fold marginal hands.\n\nBut wait, let me reconsider - I have Ace-high. If they have a worse Ace (like A2-A8), I might actually be ahead. But it's more likely they have some pair or better.\n\nActually, looking at the board again: Ts Jc 4h 3c Ad\n- If they have any pair (44, JJ, TT), they beat me\n- If they have any Ace, they beat me (unless it's A2-A8, but then we're splitting or they win)\n- If they have King-high, I win\n- If they have Queen-high, I win\n\nThe problem is most hands that called the flop and checked turn are either:\n1. Marginal pairs (44, 66-99, maybe JJ/TT)\n2. Draws that missed\n3. Ace-high that they're trying to showdown\n\nIf I bet, I might fold out:\n- Missed draws\n- Some weaker pairs\n- Ace-high hands\n\nBut I might get called by:\n- Any pair\n- Any Ace\n\nGiven the pot is 28, I could make a small bluff of maybe 16-20 chips. But is it worth it?\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. I have position and the opponent showed weakness on the turn. The Ace is a great scare card. If they had an Ace, they might have bet the turn. If they have a pair, the Ace is scary.\n\nBut I have literally nothing. Ace-high with 9 kicker is not winning at showdown often enough to justify checking. \n\nI think the best play is to check. Here's why:\n1. I have some showdown value with Ace-high\n2. A bluff might not work often enough to be profitable\n3. The opponent called the flop, so they have something\n4. It's a small pot, not worth risking chips\n5. If I check and they have nothing, I might win anyway\n\nWait, but I have 9-high, not Ace-high! The board has an Ace, but I don't have an Ace in my hand. I have 9s",

Check and lose at showdown (since I have 9-high)\n2. Make a bluff bet to try to win the pot\n\nGiven the Ace on the river is a scare card, and my opponent checked both turn and river, showing weakness, a bluff could work. However, they called the flop bet, so they likely have something.\n\nSince I have zero showdown value, I need to either bluff or give up. The pot is 28 chips. \n\nActually, wait - I need to reconsider. If I bet and get called, I lose the bet. If I check, I lose the pot. Since I have 9-high, I cannot win at showdown. So checking is just giving up.\n\nA small bluff might be worth it. The opponent showed weakness by checking turn and river. The Ace is scary. I could bet around 16-20 chips.\n\nBut let me think about the opponent's stack. They have 120 chips left. A bet of 16-20 chips is meaningful but not huge.\n\nHowever, without any specific reads on this opponent, and given that they called the flop, I think the conservative play is to check and give up. Bluffing without any equity or reads is generally not profitable.\n\nActually, I just realized - I have position and my opponent has shown weakness by checking twice (turn and river). This is a good spot to bluff. Since I have no showdown value, I should either bluff or fold (check-fold).\n\nGiven the Ace is a scare card and the opponent checked twice, I think a small bluff is appropriate. I'll bet around 16 chips (just over half pot) to try to take it down.\n\nWait, but the minimum raise is 8 chips. So I could bet as little as 8 chips or more. A small bet of 8-12 chips might look like a value bet and could get folds from hands that are beating me.\n\nLet me reconsider again. I have 9-high. I literally cannot win unless I bluff. The opponent:\n- Raised preflop (showing strength)\n- Called my flop bet (has something)\n- Checked turn (weakness)\n- Checked river (weakness)\n\nThe turn and river checks suggest they don't have a strong hand. The Ace on the river is scary. This is actually a decent bluff spot.\n\nI'll make a small bet that looks like a value bet. Something like 12-16 chips.\n\nActually, you know what, I think I'm overthinking this. Let me check what hands I lose to:\n- Any pair (44, 66-QQ)\n- Any Ace\n- Any two cards that make a pair with the board\n\nAnd I only beat:\n- Complete air (which might just check back anyway)\n- King-high, Queen-high (unlikely to call flop)\n\nSince the opponent called the flop, they likely have at least some pair or draw. The turn check suggests the draw missed or they have a weak pair. The river Ace is scary to weak pairs.\n\nBut I think the most prudent play here, without reads, is to just check and give up. It's not worth risking chips in this spot.\n\nWait, I need to make a decision. Let me think about this differently. If I check, I lose 100% of the time. If I bet, I might win some percentage of the time. What size should I bet?\n\nGiven the pot is 28, a bet of 14 (half pot) or less could work. But I need to think about what the opponent has. They raised preflop, so they could have:\n- Big pairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT) - but would check turn and river?\n- AK, AQ, AJ, AT - but would check turn and river?\n- Medium pairs (99-77) - possible\n- Suited connectors - possible\n\nActually, if they had a big hand, they'd likely bet turn or river. The checks suggest weakness. \n\nI think I should make a small bluff here. Let me bet 12 chips. This is less than half pot and might get folds from marginal hands.\n\nBut wait - the minimum raise is 8 chips, and I can raise to any amount 8 or higher. So betting 12 is fine.\n\nActually, I'm going to be conservative here. Without specific reads that this opponent can fold marginal hands, I'll check and give up. It's not worth the risk.\n\nNo wait",

I lose to:\n   - Any pair (44, JJ, TT, or any pocket pair)\n   - Any Ace (Ax)\n   - Any two cards that make a pair with the board\n   - Literally any hand that isn't 8-high or worse\n\n2. **Showdown value**: Zero. I cannot win at showdown.\n\n3. **Opponent's actions**:\n   - Raised preflop to 6 (showing some strength)\n   - Called my flop bet of 8 (has something)\n   - Checked turn (weakness or pot control)\n   - Checked river (weakness)\n\n4. **Board texture**: The Ace on the river is a scare card that could complete some draws and is scary to marginal hands.\n\n5. **My options**:\n   - **Check**: I lose the pot 100% of the time since I have 9-high\n   - **Bet (bluff)**: I might win the pot if opponent folds\n\n6. **Bluff considerations**:\n   - The opponent showed weakness by checking turn and river\n   - The Ace is scary to many hands\n   - I have position\n   - However, they called the flop, so they have something\n   - Without specific reads, bluffing is risky\n\n7. **Pot size**: 28 chips.

The opponent is shorter (60 BB).\n\n**Decision**: Since I have zero showdown value, I must either bluff or give up. The opponent's turn and river checks suggest weakness. The Ace is a good scare card. I'll make a small bluff that looks like a value bet.\n\nI'll bet 12 chips (less than half pot). If they fold, I win 28 chips. If they call, I lose 12 chips.

Without any reads on this specific opponent, and given that they called the flop (showing they have something), a bluff is quite risky. \n\nThe most prudent play is to check and give up. It's a small pot, and risking chips without a strong read isn't optimal. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nActually, I'm going back to the bluff. Since I literally cannot win by checking, and the opponent has shown weakness, a small bluff is the only way to win this pot. The Ace on the river is the perfect scare card.\n\nLet me bet 12 chips.",

Looking at their history, they seem tight-aggressive. They've folded preflop several times, raised to 6 a couple times, and defended their blind once (hand 20). They called a flop bet and river bet in hand 20, showing they can defend.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - 205 chips. Very tight! They've folded preflop 4 out of 5 recent hands, only calling once. When they called, they checked down to showdown with A3.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN, which is great position postflop.\n\n**Hand Strength:** Qd Td is a good suited connector hand, especially on the button. It has good postflop playability and can make strong hands.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Position advantage:** BTN is the best position\n2. **Hand playability:** QTs suited is a solid raising hand from BTN\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** SB is moderately aggressive, BB is very tight\n4. **Stack sizes:** I have a healthy stack, can afford to play this hand\n5. **Pot odds:** Need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1), which is marginal but position makes up for it\n\nGiven I'm on the BTN with a playable suited hand, and the BB is very tight (folding 80% of the time), I should raise to:\n- Steal the blinds\n- Build the pot when I have position\n- Put pressure on the tight BB\n\nA standard raise would be 3x the BB = 12 chips. This is a good steal size and gives me control postflop.\n\nLet me raise to 12.",

Could be:\n- An Ace (top pair)\n- A Jack (second pair)\n- A flush draw\n- Or a complete bluff\n\n**My situation**:\n- I have a gutshot + backdoor flush draw\n- I have position (acting last)\n- I have a healthy stack (256 chips)\n- If I call 24, I'll have 232 left (58 BB)\n\n\n- Opponent has 100 chips remaining, which is quite short\n\nI realize my pot odds are terrible. The 2.17:1 pot odds mean I need 31.6% equity, but my actual equity is much lower at 8-12%. While I have some potential with my gutshot and backdoor flush, the risk of losing another bet on the turn makes this a clear fold. Despite having position, the opponent's likely strong hand and my limited outs make continuing unwise. I should preserve my chips for better opportunities.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand, I'm in UTG (first position) with Js 5d. This is a very weak hand - Jack-5 offsuit is not a playable hand from early position in most situations.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Hand strength**: Js 5d is a weak, offsuit hand with no connectivity. The Jack is decent but the 5 kicker is terrible. This hand has poor postflop playability.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (under the gun), the worst position preflop. I have 7 players left to act behind me. When playing from early position, I need to be very tight and only play premium hands.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 256 chips (64 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Opponent observations**: Looking at the opponent actions I recalled:\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) has been folding a lot preflop\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has shown some aggression (raised in hand 19)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) is very short stacked and has been folding a lot\n   - Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been somewhat active with raises and calls\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a 64 BB stack, I'm in no danger. I should be selective and wait for better spots. Playing marginal hands from early position can lead to difficult postflop situations and unnecessary chip loss.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I would need to call 4 chips to see a flop. While the pot odds are decent (6:4 or 1.5:1), this doesn't matter much with such a weak hand from bad position. The implied odds are poor because even if I hit a Jack, I'll often be outkicked, and hitting a 5 rarely makes me a strong hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Jack-5 offsuit from UTG is not a profitable play, even at a potentially loose table. I should preserve my chips for better spots and better hands.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand. I'm in UTG (under the gun) position, which is the earliest position. I have 9s 6s - a suited connector but a weak hand, especially from early position.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Hand strength**: 96s is a speculative hand. It can make straights and flushes, but it's very weak in terms of high card value. From UTG, this is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: Being UTG means I have 4 players left to act behind me. This is the worst position to play a marginal hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 256 chips (64 BB). This is a decent stack size, but not deep enough to play speculative hands from early position without good implied odds.\n\n4. **Opponents**: Let me check what I know about the other players:\n   - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - has been aggressive with raises\n   - Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - seems tight\n   - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - has shown aggression\n   - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - short stack with only 37 chips\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I should be looking to preserve my stack and wait for better spots, especially from early position.\n\nLet me look at my recent hands to see if there's any pattern:\n\nFrom the search results:\n- Hand 18: I folded Q9c from UTG (reasonable)\n- Hand 17: I folded Q3d from CO (reasonable)\n- Hand 16: I called with 66 from BTN and folded to pressure (reasonable)\n- Hand 15: I folded Js6s from SB after calling preflop (lost to river bet)\n- Hand 14: I won with Kd6d from BB (hit trips)\n\nThe pattern shows I've been playing fairly tight, which is appropriate. \n\n96s from UTG is a clear fold. Even though it's suited, the gap makes it less valuable than connected suited cards like 87s or T9s. From early position with multiple players to act, this is a standard fold.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips (2+4 blinds), and I need to call 4 chips. While the pot odds are 1.5:1 (25% equity needed), this hand doesn't have enough equity against the ranges of players behind me, and the implied odds aren't sufficient from this position.\n\nDecision: FOLD",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: 6s 5c (suited connector, but low)\n- Stack: 252 chips (63 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- Amount to call: 4 (the small blind raised from 2 to 8, so I need to put in 4 more to call)\n\n**Situation:**\n- Everyone folded except Seat 5 (small blind) who raised to 8\n- I'm on the button with 6-5 offsuit (6s 5c)\n- I need to call 4 chips to see a flop\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 6-5 offsuit is a weak hand. It's not suited, and the cards are low. This hand has very little showdown value.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position post-flop. This is an advantage.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 5 has a very small stack (29 chips, ~7 BB). This is a short stack. Their raise from SB could be:\n   - A strong hand trying to get value\n   - A desperation move with a weak hand (given their short stack)\n   - A standard steal attempt\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 to win 12 chips, so I'm getting 3:1 pot odds. This means I need ~25% equity to call.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (63 BB) vs opponent's short stack (7 BB). \n\nLet me think about what hands Seat 5 might have from the SB with such a short stack. With 29 chips left, they might be:\n- Shoving all-in with any decent hand\n- Raising to 8 to induce action\n- Making a desperation play\n\nGiven that they only raised to 8 (not all-in), they might have:\n- A medium strength hand that wants action\n- A strong hand that wants to trap\n- A steal attempt\n\nWith 6-5 offsuit, I have very poor equity against most ranges. Even if they're stealing wide, I'm not in great shape.\n \nI see the button position offers some strategic flexibility. With a speculative hand like 6-5 offsuit, I could potentially call and see if I can outplay my opponent post-flop. However, the hand's inherent weakness makes this a risky proposition. The 3:1 pot odds are tempting, but my actual hand equity is likely much lower than the required 25%. \n\nThe short stack of my opponent adds another layer of complexity. Their raise might indicate strength or desperation, and I'm not convinced calling with such a marginal hand is the right move. I'll need to carefully weigh the potential risks against the limited upside of continuing with this hand.\n\nMy stack size gives me some breathing room, but that doesn't mean I should throw chips away on a weak holding. Folding seems like the most prudent decision here, preserving my chips for a better opportunity.",

This is a shove.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength**: A4o is a marginal hand, especially from SB\n2. **Pot odds**: I need to call 39 to win 47 (pot) + 39 (my call) = 86 chips. That's about 45% equity needed\n3. **Opponent's range**: Since this player has been very passive and now shoves, their range is likely strong. They could have: pairs (22+), strong Ax hands (A10+), broadway cards\n4. **Tournament situation**: I have a healthy stack of 62.5 BB. Risking 39 chips (15.6% of my stack) with A4o against a likely strong range is not ideal\n5. **Position**: I'll be out of position postflop if I call, but since opponent is all-in, there's no postflop play\n\nLet me calculate the equity of A4o against a typical shoving range:\n- Against a tight range (66+, AJs+, AQo+): ~30% equity\n- Against a wider range (22+, A2s+, KTs+, QJs, ATo+): ~38% equity\n\nGiven the pot odds require ~45% equity, and I'm likely behind their range, this is a fold.\n\nThe fact that this opponent has been very passive and suddenly shoves suggests real strength. They wouldn't do this lightly.\n\n**Decision**: Fold",

It's strong enough to play but not a premium hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position. I get to act last post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 raised to 8. Let me look at their history:\n   - They've been relatively tight, folding 7 times out of 20 actions shown\n   - When they do raise preflop (hand 19), it was a min-raise to 4\n   - They've shown willingness to bet post-flop but also fold when facing pressure\n   - In hand 22, they called preflop, bet on flop, then folded to a raise\n   - In hand 23, they called preflop, bet on flop, called a raise, then checked down\n\n4. **Stack Sizes**: \n   - I have 250 chips (62.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - MiniMax-M2 has 250 chips - same as me\n   - The raise is to 8, which is 2x the BB\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: Pot is 14, I need to call 8. That's about 1.75:1 pot odds, which is good for a suited Ace with position.\n\n6. **Tournament Consideration**: With a healthy stack of 62.5 BB, I can afford to see flops with speculative hands like ATs, especially in position.\n\nThe raise from MiniMax-M2 is relatively small (only 2x BB). Given their history of folding to pressure and their relatively tight play, I have a few options:\n\n- **Fold**: Too tight, ATs on button is definitely playable\n- **Call**: Reasonable, I get to see flop in position with a decent hand\n- **Raise**: Could be good to apply pressure, especially given opponent's tendency to fold to pressure\n\nGiven that I have position, a decent hand, and an opponent who seems to play straightforwardly and can fold to pressure, I think a call is the best option. I want to keep the pot small with ATs unless I hit the flop well. \n\nI could consider a 3-bet to apply pressure, but ATs plays better as a call in position where I can control the pot size and make decisions based on flop texture. The opponent's raise size is small enough that calling doesn't commit me too much.\n\nLet me make the call.",

I have 6 outs to top pair plus backdoor flush draw. MiniMax-M2 has shown tendency to bet flops but fold to raises (see hand 22). Good position on button allows me to take control of the hand.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: Tc Ac - I have Ace-Ten of clubs. This is a decent hand with a strong ace.\n2. **Position**: BTN (Button) - Good position, I act last post-flop.\n3. **Stack**: 242 chips (60.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n4. **Board**: 3s 6h Qc - The board is relatively dry with no flush draw (except my backdoor clubs) and no straight draws. There's a Q which is higher than my T.\n5. **Action**: Preflop - Seat 4 raised to 8, I called. Seat 4 then bet 12 on the flop.\n\nLet me analyze MiniMax-M2's tendencies from the data:\n- They raise preflop fairly often (hands 19, 22, 23, 26)\n- They frequently continuation bet on the flop (hands 16, 19, 22, 23, 26)\n- In hand 22, they bet 16 on flop then folded to a raise\n- In hand 23, they bet 8 on flop, called a raise, then checked turn and river\n\nSo MiniMax-M2 is aggressive preflop and on the flop, but can fold to pressure. Their flop bets vary in size.\n\n**Current situation**:\n- Pot: 34 chips\n- Bet to call: 12 chips\n- Pot odds: 34:12 or about 2.8:1\n- I have 2 overcards (A and T) to the board. If MiniMax has a Q, I'm behind. If they have a pocket pair like 99, JJ, etc., I'm also behind.\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (need two more clubs)\n- I have 6 outs to top pair (3 Aces, 3 Tens) = about 24% equity on the turn\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. My hand is marginal - just Ace-high with backdoor draws\n2. I'm in position which is good\n3. MiniMax is aggressive but can fold to pressure\n4. Pot odds are decent (need ~26% equity to call)\n5. I have tournament stack considerations - losing 12 chips won't hurt much\n\n\n6. I could raise as a semi-bluff, but that risks more chips\n\nI see a strategic opportunity here. With my position and the opponent's tendency to fold under pressure, a call makes the most sense. I'll keep the pot small while maintaining the chance to improve my hand. The backdoor flush draw adds a subtle potential for a stronger hand on later streets. Calling allows me to gather more information without committing too many chips prematurely.\n\nThe semi-bluff raise becomes an attractive option given my opponent's past behavior of folding to aggression. By raising, I can potentially win the pot immediately or set up a favorable situation on the turn. The key is applying pressure while keeping my risk manageable.\n\nMy stack size provides flexibility, and the 12-chip investment represents a calculated risk. The potential to take down the pot now or improve my hand makes this a strategic move worth considering.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: Tc Ac (Ace-Ten of clubs)\n- Position: BTN\n- My stack: 206 chips (51.5 BB)\n- Board: 3s 6h Qc 9s\n- Pot: 118 chips\n- Action: MiniMax-M2 bet 24 on turn\n- I need to call 24\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have Ace-high with a gutshot straight draw (need a Jack for straight)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (need another club)\n- On the flop, I raised MiniMax-M2's bet, showing strength\n- MiniMax-M2 called my flop raise and is now betting the turn\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (MiniMax-M2):**\nLooking at the opponent actions:\n- They frequently fold preflop (hands 17, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25)\n- When they do play, they tend to bet on flops (hands 16, 19, 22, 23)\n- They sometimes fold to pressure (hand 22 folded on flop)\n- They can call raises (hands 16, 23)\n- They check turns and rivers when called (hands 16, 23)\n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have Ace-high with some draws. Not a strong made hand.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position.\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 bet on flop, called my raise, and now bets turn. This suggests they have something - possibly top pair, two pair, or a strong draw.\n4. **Pot Odds**: Pot is 118, I need to call 24. That's about 4.9:1 pot odds. With my gutshot and backdoor flush, I have about 10% equity (4 outs for gutshot = ~8%, plus some backdoor equity). The pot odds are decent but not great.\n5. **Stack Preservation**: I have a healthy stack of 51.5 BB. I don't want to jeopardize it with a marginal hand.\n\n**Key Insight**: The fact that MiniMax-M2 called my flop raise and is now betting the turn suggests they have a decent hand. My Ace-high is likely behind. While I have some outs, I'm probably drawing to 4 outs (any Jack) for the straight. The backdoor flush is unlikely.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold. My hand is too weak, I'm likely behind, and I don't have enough equity to justify the call. Even though the pot odds are decent, I'm risking chips with a marginal hand against an opponent who has shown strength throughout the hand.\n\nLet me make the fold decision.",

If I just call, I let them see the flop cheaply. If I raise, I might take it down preflop or have initiative post-flop.\n\nMinimum raise is to 8 chips. This would be a 6 chip raise (putting in 8 total). Given the BB's tightness, a raise seems good here. I could also just call and see a cheap flop with position.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight pattern and my position, I think stealing the blinds here is a good play. A raise to 8 seems appropriate - it's not too big but puts pressure on the tight BB.\n\nLet me consider the alternatives:\n- Fold: Too weak with this hand on the Button against a tight BB\n- Call: Could work, but I lose initiative and let the BB see flop cheaply\n- Raise: Good for stealing, maintains initiative, leverages position\n\nI think raising to 8 is the best play.",

Position: I'm on the button which is good, but I'm out of position postflop if I call\n3. Opponent: Very tight player who folds a lot preflop. Their 3-bet likely represents a strong range (QQ+, AK, maybe JJ)\n4. Stack size: I have 200 chips, calling 16 more would leave me with 184. If I raise, minimum is 40 which would be a 4-bet\n5. Pot odds: I need to call 16 to win 32, getting 2:1 odds. Against a tight range, this is not enough\n\nJ9o is dominated by most of their 3-betting range. Even if I hit a J, I'm often dominated by AJ/KJ/QJ. If I hit a 9, same issue. The only good scenario is hitting two pair or a straight, which is unlikely.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature and my weak hand, this is a clear fold. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nThe minimum raise to 40 would be a 4-bet bluff, which is too aggressive against a tight player who is likely to have a real hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 8d Kh - King-high, offsuit, decent but not premium. K8o is a marginal hand.\n\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - Excellent position, last to act postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 200 chips (50 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Pot:** 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 206 chips - Has been relatively tight, folding many hands preflop. Did raise in hand #22 and #30.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 231 chips - Very tight, folding most preflop. Only called once in hand #27 then folded.\n\n**Observations:**\n- Both opponents have been playing tight, especially the BB\n- SB has shown some aggression with raises in hands #22 and #30\n- I have position advantage on both players\n- Pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1) which is not great for a marginal hand\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength:** K8o is marginal, dominated by better Kx hands\n2. **Position:** Excellent on the button\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** Both seem tight, making stealing profitable\n4. **Stack sizes:** Healthy, can afford to see a flop\n5. **Tournament:** Still early(ish) with 50BB stacks\n\nI should consider raising to steal the blinds from these tight players, especially with position. A standard raise would be 3x BB = 12 chips. However, calling is also reasonable given the position and the fact that I'm getting 1.5:1 on my money against potentially weak ranges.\n\nLet me think about the best play:\n- **Fold:** Too tight from the button with K8o against tight blinds\n- **Call:** Reasonable, see a flop in position, but K8o can be problematic\n- **Raise:** Good for stealing, puts pressure on tight players\n\nGiven that both opponents fold a lot preflop (especially the BB who has folded 8/10 recent hands), a raise seems profitable. I'll raise to 12 chips (3x BB) as a standard steal attempt.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking more carefully:\n- The SB has been more active with raises in hands #22 and #30\n- The BB is extremely tight, folding 9/10 recent hands\n- My hand K8o is weak but playable in position\n- If I raise and get called, I'll be out of position postflop (wait no, I'm on the button so I'll have position)\n\nActually, I have position on both players since I'm on the button. Let me recalculate:\n- Seat 1: Me (BTN) - position is last to act postflop\n- Seat 2: SB - acts first postflop\n- Seat 3: BB - acts second postflop\n\nSo I have position advantage on both players.\n\nGiven the tightness of both opponents, a raise seems like the best play. I'll make it 12 chips (3x BB) as a standard steal size.\n\nWait, let me think about the minimum raise amount. The minimum raise to is 8, which means I can raise to 8 total (adding 4 more chips). But a standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 12 chips total. Let me raise to 12.\n\nActually, looking at the data again, the SB has shown aggression. If I raise and the SB comes back with a re-raise, I should be prepared to fold K8o. But the likelihood of both players folding to a button raise given their tight stats is high enough to make this profitable.\n\nFinal decision: Raise to 12 chips as a steal attempt against two tight players.",

This is a significant raise of 7.25x the big blind from early position.\n\n4. **Position**: I'm in CO (Cutoff), which is good position, but there's still Button, SB, and BB to act after me.\n\n5. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B is out of chips (0), so they must be all-in or this is a mistake. Wait, let me re-read...\n\nActually, the player states show GPT-OSS-120B has 0 chips (out), but the action says they raised to 29. This doesn't make sense. Let me assume this means they had 0 chips at the start of this hand and went all-in for their remaining stack, which must have been at least 29.\n\nGiven the confusion about GPT-OSS-120B's stack, I should treat this as a standard raise to 29.\n\n**Analysis of the raise**: \n- 7.25x BB raise from early position suggests strength\n- From UTG, this typically means premium hands: AA, KK, QQ, AK, possibly JJ, TT, AQ\n\n**My hand vs. that range**: \n- JTo is way behind that range\n- Even if they're weaker, I'm dominated by AJ, KJ, QJ, JT\n- Only about 30-35% equity against a typical UTG raising range\n\n**Pot odds**: \n- Pot is 35, I need to call 29\n- Getting about 1.2:1, need ~45% equity to call\n- I don't have that with JTo\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have a healthy stack, no need to gamble\n- Better spots will come\n- Preserving chips is important\n\nI should fold this hand.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n**My Hand:** Jc Js (pocket jacks) - a strong starting hand\n**Position:** BTN (button) - best position\n**Stack:** 202 chips (50.5 BB) - healthy stack\n**Blinds:** 2/4\n**Pot:** 28 chips\n\n**Current action:**\n- Seat 4 (SB) posted 2\n- I (BB) posted 4\n- Seat 2 raised to 12\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 4 (SB) called 10 (to match the raise)\n\n**To call:** 8 chips (12 - 4 I already posted)\n**Minimum raise to:** 20 chips\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):**\n- Very tight preflop player - folded 5 hands in a row before hand #30\n- Hand #30: raised to 24\n- Hand #31: folded\n- Hand #32: called 29, then bet 45 on flop, then folded to a raise\n- Only showdown shown: Ks As (very strong hand)\n- This player seems tight-aggressive, only playing strong hands\n\n**Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2):**\n- More active preflop - multiple raises (12, 8, 16)\n- Called a raise in hand #32\n- Showdowns show strong hands: Qs Ks, Kh Kc, 6d 6c, Ad 5d\n- This player seems loose-aggressive, playing a wider range\n\n**Decision analysis:**\n\nI have pocket jacks on the button, which is a premium hand. I should definitely play this hand. The question is whether to call or raise.\n\n**Pot odds:** Calling 8 to win 28 = 3.5:1, which is very good.\n\n**Reasons to raise:**\n1. I have a premium hand (JJ)\n2. I'm in position (button)\n3. Seat 2's raise suggests strength, but Seat 4's call could be with a wide range\n4. I want to isolate or build a pot with my strong hand\n5. I don't want to give good odds to hands like AK, AQ to chase\n\n**Reasons to just call:**\n1. Seat 2 is tight and likely has a strong range (QQ+, AK maybe)\n2. Keep the pot smaller if an overcard comes\n3. Disguise hand strength\n\nHowever, with pocket jacks, I should be aggressive. The standard play is to 3-bet here. Given the action:\n- Seat 2 raised to 12 (3x BB)\n- Seat 4 called\n\nA good 3-bet size would be around 3x the original raise, so about 36-40 chips. Since minimum raise is 20, I can raise to 40 or even go higher.\n\nLet me consider stack sizes:\n- Seat 2 has 120 chips (30 BB) - relatively short\n- Seat 4 has 345 chips (86 BB) - deep stack\n- I have 202 chips (50 BB) - medium stack\n\nGiven Seat 2 is short-stacked and tight, if I raise and they shove, I'm likely flipping against AK/AQ or dominated against QQ+. But with JJ, I'm often ahead of their range.\n\nGiven Seat 4's loose nature, I want to charge them to see a flop.\n\nI think a raise to 40 chips (10x BB) is appropriate here. It's a standard 3-bet size and builds the pot with my premium hand while in position.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The pot is 28, and I need to call 8. If I raise to 40, that's a raise of 32. Given the action and stack sizes, I could also consider raising to 36 or 40.\n\nI'll raise to 40 chips. This is about 3x the original raise and puts pressure on both opponents.",

          "content": "  Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- I have Jc Js (pocket Jacks) on the BTN\n- My stack: 166 chips (41.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 172 chips\n- Amount to call: 80\n- Minimum raise to: 200\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Seat 4 posted SB 2\n- I posted BB 4\n- Seat 2 raised 12 (to 12 total)\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 4 called 10 (to 12 total)\n- I raised 40 (to 52 total)\n- Seat 2 raised 120 (to 172 total)\n- Seat 4 folded\n\nSo the action is back to me. I need to call 80 chips to see a pot of 172 + 80 = 252 chips.\n\n**Opponent analysis - Seat 2:**\nFrom the recall data, Seat 2 appears to be an aggressive player. Looking at their actions:\n- Hand 20: raised preflop to 6, called flop bet 8, called river bet 12 (won with Ks As)\n- Hand 21: called preflop 10, bet 24 on flop\n- Hand 22: raised preflop 12, raised flop 45\n- Hand 30: raised preflop 24\n- Hand 32: called preflop 29, bet 45 on flop, then folded\n\nThey seem to play aggressively with strong hands. The fact that they're willing to 4-bet to 172 chips suggests they have a very strong hand.\n\n**My hand strength:**\nPocket Jacks are strong but vulnerable to overcards. Against a 4-bet from an aggressive player, I'm likely facing:\n- Premium pairs (AA, KK, QQ)\n- AK (suited or offsuit)\n- Possibly AQ or TT\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Need to call 80 to win 252\n- Pot odds: 80/252 = 31.7%\n- I need ~32% equity to call\n\n**My stack:**\nI have 166 chips total. If I call 80, I'll have 86 chips left (21.5 BB). If I raise, minimum is 200 which puts me all-in.\n\nLet me think about the equity of JJ against a 4-betting range:\n- vs AA/KK: ~20% equity\n- vs QQ: ~45% equity\n- vs AK: ~55% equity\n- vs TT: ~80% equity\n\nIf Seat 2's 4-bet range is {AA, KK, QQ, AK}, my equity is roughly:\n- 3 combos each of AA/KK = 6 combos (20% equity)\n- 6 combos of QQ = 6 combos (45% equity)\n- 16 combos of AK = 16 combos (55% equity)\n\nWeighted equity: (6\u00d70.2 + 6\u00d70.45 + 16\u00d70.55) / 28 = (1.2 + 2.7 + 8.8) / 28 = 12.7/28 = 45.4%\n\nSo against that range, I have about 45% equity, which is better than the 32% I need.\n\nHowever, this is a tournament and stack preservation matters. If I call and lose, I'll be down to 86 chips. If I fold, I keep 166 chips.\n\nThe pot is already 172 and I need to call 80. This is a big pot relative to stacks. \n\nLooking at the action:\n- Seat 2 initial raise to 12 (3x BB)\n- I 3-bet to 40 (10x BB)\n- Seat 2 4-bets to 172 (43x BB)\n\nThis is a massive 4-bet, suggesting extreme strength. The fact that Seat 2 has only 12 chips left after this bet means they're essentially all-in.\n\nWait, let me check Seat 2's stack again. It says \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 12 chips\". So they raised 120, which would leave them with 12 chips. This means they're committed.\n\nGiven that this is essentially an all-in from Seat 2, and the pot is already so large, I need to decide if I want to commit with JJ.\n\nIn a tournament situation, with 41.5 BB, I should be careful about getting all-in preflop with JJ unless I'm confident my opponent is very wide. But the pot odds are compelling.\n\nLet me reconsider: I have to call 80 to win 252. That's 3.15:1 pot odds. I need 24% equity to break even. Even against {AA, KK, QQ}, I have about 33% equity ((6\u00d70"

I need to call 80 chips to see a pot of 172 + 80 = 252 chips.\n\n**Opponent analysis - Seat 2:**\nFrom the recall data, Seat 2 appears to be an aggressive player. Looking at their actions:\n- Hand 20: raised preflop to 6, called flop bet 8, called river bet 12 (won with Ks As)\n- Hand 21: called preflop 10, bet 24 on flop\n- Hand 22: raised preflop 12, raised flop 45\n- Hand 30: raised preflop 24\n- Hand 32: called preflop 29, bet 45 on flop, then folded\n\nThey seem to play aggressively with strong hands. The fact that they're willing to 4-bet to 172 chips suggests they have a very strong hand.\n\n**My hand strength:**\nPocket Jacks are strong but vulnerable to overcards. Against a 4-bet from an aggressive player, I'm likely facing:\n- Premium pairs (AA, KK, QQ)\n- AK (suited or offsuit)\n- Possibly AQ or TT\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Need to call 80 to win 252\n- Pot odds: 80/252 = 31.7%\n- I need ~32% equity to call\n\n**My stack:**\nI have 166 chips total. If I call 80, I'll have 86 chips left (21.5 BB). If I raise, minimum is 200 which puts me all-in.\n\nLet me think about the equity of JJ against a 4-betting range:\n- vs AA/KK: ~20% equity\n- vs QQ: ~45% equity\n- vs AK: ~55% equity\n- vs TT: ~80% equity\n\nIf Seat 2's 4-bet range is {AA, KK, QQ, AK}, my equity is roughly:\n- 3 combos each of AA/KK = 6 combos (20% equity)\n- 6 combos of QQ = 6 combos (45% equity)\n- 16 combos of AK = 16 combos (55% equity)\n\nWeighted equity: (6\u00d70.2 + 6\u00d70.45 + 16\u00d70.55) / 28 = (1.2 + 2.7 + 8.8) / 28 = 12.7/28 = 45.4%\n\nSo against that range, I have about 45% equity, which is better than the 32% I need.\n\nHowever, this is a tournament and stack preservation matters.

The fact that Seat 2 has only 12 chips left after this bet means they're essentially all-in.\n\nWait, let me check Seat 2's stack again. It says \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 12 chips\". So they raised 120, which would leave them with 12 chips. This means they're committed.\n\nGiven that this is essentially an all-in from Seat 2, and the pot is already so large, I need to decide if I want to commit with JJ.\n\nIn a tournament situation, with 41.5 BB, I should be careful about getting all-in preflop with JJ unless I'm confident my opponent is very wide. But the pot odds are compelling.\n\nLet me reconsider: I have to call 80 to win 252. That's 3.15:1 pot odds. I need 24% equity to break even.

          "content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand Situation:**\n- My hand: Jc Js (pocket jacks)\n- Position: Button\n- My stack: 86 chips (21.5 BB)\n- Board: Ad 8d 7h\n- Pot: 252 chips\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 with 12 chips left\n\n**Action Analysis:**\n- Preflop was very aggressive. I 3-bet to 40, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) 4-bet to 120, I called 80 more.\n- This suggests Seat 2 has a very strong hand (likely AA, KK, QQ, AK)\n- The flop is Ad 8d 7h - this is terrible for my pocket jacks! The Ace is on board.\n- Seat 2 only has 12 chips left (3 BB), I have them covered easily.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- My pocket jacks are now essentially a bluff catcher. Any Ace beats me, and there are straight draws (9-6, T-6, T-9) and flush draws.\n- Given the preflop action, Seat 2 very likely has an Ace (AA, AK, AQ, AJ) or a big pair (KK, QQ).\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nLooking at the recall data for Kimi-K2:\n- They were very active in hands 20-22 with multiple raises\n- Then went through a folding streak (hands 23-29) - very tight\n- Hand 30: raised 24\n- Hand 31: folded\n- Hand 32: called 29, then bet 45 on flop, then folded to a raise\n- They seem to be aggressive when they enter pots but have been folding a lot lately\n\n**Current Decision:**\n- I have the option to check or bet\n- Seat 2 only has 12 chips left (3 BB)\n- The pot is 252 chips\n- If I bet, I risk 12 chips to win 252 (21:1 odds)\n- My jacks are unlikely to be good here given the Ace on board and the preflop action\n\n**Recommendation:**\nI should check here. There's no value in betting - Seat 2 will only call with hands that beat me (any Ace, sets, two pairs). If they have a bluff or draw, they might shove their remaining 12 chips as a bluff, which I can call getting great odds. Checking gives them a chance to bluff with their short stack. Also, if they check behind, I get a free card to see if I improve.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. They only have 12 chips left. If I check, they can check behind and see a free card. If I bet, I force them to commit their last chips. \n\nGiven the preflop action (they 4-bet to 120), they almost certainly have:\n- AA: crushing me\n- KK: I'm behind but they might be worried about the Ace\n- QQ: I'm ahead but again, they might be worried about the Ace\n- AK: I'm crushed\n- AQ/AJ: I'm crushed\n\nSo I'm either way ahead (vs QQ/KK) or way behind (vs AA/AK/AQ/AJ). The problem is I don't know which.\n\nWith them having only 12 chips left, I think checking is better because:\n1. If they have QQ/KK, they might check behind fearing the Ace\n2. If they have nothing/air, they might bluff shove 12 chips which I can call\n3. If they have AA/AK/AQ, they might shove anyway and I can fold\n\nActually, wait - checking seems too passive. Let me think about the bet:\n- If I bet minimum (80), that's way too much relative to their stack\n- I could put them all-in for 12 more chips\n- If I bet 12 (all-in), I'm risking 12 to win 252 (21:1 odds)\n\nIf I bet 12:\n- They fold hands that don't have an Ace (KK, QQ, air) - I win 252\n- They call/shove with Ace hands - I lose 12\n\nGiven they 4-bet preflop, the chance they have an Ace is high. But 21:1 odds means I only need to be good ~4.8% of the time for a bet to be profitable.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the entire situation. I have Jc Js on an Ad 8d 7h board against an opponent who 4-bet preflop and now has 12 chips left.\n\nThe SPR (stack-to-pot ratio) is extremely low (12/252 = 0.05). This is a trivial all-in decision.\n\nI think betting is actually better because:\n1. I can fold out some hands that have equity against me (like KK, QQ that might hit"

Seat 2 raised, I re-raised, Seat 2 shoved (120 total), I called 80 more.\n- Flop: I checked, Seat 2 checked\n- Turn: It's on me to act\n\nSo this is heads-up between me (Seat 1) and Seat 2. Seat 2 has 12 chips left after the preflop action. Let me calculate:\n\nPreflop action details:\n- Seat 4 posted SB: 2\n- I posted BB: 4\n- Seat 2 raised to 12\n- Seat 4 called 10\n- I raised to 40\n- Seat 2 raised to 120 (all-in)\n- Seat 4 folded\n- I called 80 (putting in 120 total)\n\nSo going to flop:\n- Seat 2 put in 120 chips, so they started with 120+? Actually, they have 12 left now, so they started with 132 chips.\n- I put in 120 chips, so I have 86 left now, meaning I started with 206 chips.\n\nCurrent pot is 252 chips. Let me verify:\n- Preflop: SB (2) + BB (4) + Seat 2 (120) + Me (120) = 246\n- Actually, Seat 4 folded after calling 10, so their 10 is also in the pot.\n- So: 2 + 4 + 10 + 120 + 120 = 256... close enough, maybe some rounding.\n\nSeat 2 has 12 chips left and is all-in or will be all-in on the turn.\n\nThe board: Ad 8d 7h 4c\nMy hand: Jc Js\n\nSo I have pocket Jacks on a board with:\n- Ace of diamonds\n- 8 of diamonds\n- 7 of hearts\n- 4 of clubs\n\nThis is a scary board for pocket Jacks. The Ace is a major concern. There are also diamond draw possibilities and straight draw possibilities.\n\nLet me think about what Seat 2 could have:\nGiven the preflop action (raise, 4-bet, 5-bet all-in), they likely have:\n- Premium pairs: AA, KK, QQ, JJ (but I have JJ)\n- AK, AQ, maybe AQs\n- Maybe some bluffs\n\nThe flop was Ad 8d 7h and I checked, they checked. This is interesting. If they had an Ace, would they check? Maybe if they have AK, AQ, they might check to control pot size or induce a bet. If they have a pocket pair like KK or QQ, they might check on this Ace-high board.\n\nNow the turn is 4c, which doesn't change much. It might complete some straight draws (53 got there, but that's unlikely given preflop action).\n\nI have 86 chips left, Seat 2 has 12 chips left. If I bet, I can force them all-in. The pot is 252, and they only have 12 left.\n\nMy options:\n1. Check - let them see a free river card\n2. Bet - put them all-in\n\nGiven that they checked the flop, they might be weak. But there's also an Ace on board, which is scary for my Jacks.\n\nLet me think about pot odds. If I bet 12 to win 252, that's 21:1 pot odds for them. They'll call with almost anything.\n\nShould I bet or check?\n- If I'm ahead (they have something like KK, QQ, or a bluff), I should bet to get value and protect my hand\n- If I'm behind (they have Ax), I should check and see if I can get to showdown cheaply\n\nGiven the preflop aggression, Seat 2 could easily have:\n- AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, 99\n- AK, AQ\n- Some bluffs\n\nThe Ace on board hits a lot of their preflop range. But they checked the flop, which suggests they don't have a strong Ace, or they have a medium hand they're trying to showdown cheaply.\n\nWith only 12 chips left for them, I think I should bet and put them all-in. The pot is too big relative to their stack to give them a free card. Even if I'm behind, I might have outs (two Jacks left for a set), and sometimes they'll fold a small pocket pair or a bluff.\n\nActually,"

Let me recalculate:\n\nLooking at the hand setup again:\n- Amount to call: 0\n- Minimum raise to: 80\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\nSo if I want to raise, I need to raise to at least 80.

If the minimum raise is 80 and Seat 2 only has 12 chips left, then:\n- If I raise to 80, I'm putting in 80 chips, but Seat 2 can only call 12\n- The raise would put me all-in (or close to it)\n\nActually, let me reconsider the entire hand situation:\n\nPot: 252 chips\nMy stack: 86 chips\nOpponent stack: 12 chips\nBoard: Ad 8d 7h 4c\nMy hand: Jc Js\n\nThe opponent checked the flop on an Ace-high board. They have 12 chips left.\n\nIf I check:\n- They get a free river card\n- We go to showdown with current board\n\nIf I bet/raise:\n- Minimum raise is 80, but I only have 86\n- I could go all-in for 86\n- They can only call 12, so they'd be all-in\n\nGiven the opponent has 12 chips left and the pot is 252 (21:1 pot odds for them), they will call with any hand they have. Checking gives them a free shot at beating me.\n\nWith pocket Jacks on an Ace-high board, I should protect my hand. Even though I might be behind to Ax, the opponent's check on the flop suggests weakness. They could have:\n- KK, QQ, JJ that checked scared of the Ace\n- A draw that checked\n- A weak Ace that checked\n\nI think the right play is to bet/raise and put them all-in rather than give a free card. Since minimum raise is 80 and I have 86, I should go all-in.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. Since the amount to call is 0, I can check. If I want to bet, I need to raise to at least 80. But since opponent only has 12, raising to 80 is effectively the same as going all-in for 86.\n\nLet me reconsider: With pocket Jacks on this board, facing an opponent who has shown weakness by checking the flop, and with them having only 12 chips left, I think betting to put them all-in is correct. The Ace is scary, but their check suggests they don't have a strong Ace.\n\nI'll go all-in for my remaining 86 chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the Button with 8d 8c (pocket eights)\n- My stack: 336 chips (84 BB)\n- Only opponent: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) in BB with 8 chips\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- I need to call 2 more chips to see the flop\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at Seat 2's recent actions:\n- Hand 29: Preflop fold\n- Hand 30: Preflop raise to 24 chips (very large raise)\n- Hand 31: Preflop fold  \n- Hand 32: Called 29, then bet 45 on flop, then folded\n- Hand 33: Raised to 12 preflop, then raised to 120 (all-in), checked flop, folded turn\n\nThis player seems aggressive and willing to play big pots. They went all-in in hand 33. They're currently very short-stacked with only 8 chips (2 BB).\n\n**Hand strength:**\n8-8 is a decent hand, especially heads-up. Against a random hand, 8-8 has about 70% equity. Against a short-stacked opponent, this is a very strong hand.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm on the Button, which is great position post-flop (though position matters less when opponent is all-in).\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- I have 336 chips (84 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent has only 8 chips (2 BB) - extremely short\n- This is a tournament, so eliminating opponents is valuable\n\n**Decision:**\nWith pocket 8s on the Button against a player who is down to just 8 chips (2 BB), this is a clear raise situation. The opponent is likely to call with a very wide range given their desperation stack size. I want to get value and potentially eliminate them.\n\nThe minimum raise is to 8 chips, but given the opponent only has 8 chips total, I should just raise to put them all-in. This would be a raise to 10 (2 to call + 8 more = total of 10), but since they only have 8 chips, I can just raise to 8 and they'll be all-in for their remaining 6 chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: The pot is 6 (2+4), I posted the SB of 2. To call I need to put in 2 more. If I raise to 8 total, that means I'm putting in 6 more than the call amount. The opponent has 8 chips total and has put in 4 as BB, so they have 4 left. So if I raise to 8, they would need to call 4 more to match (they already put in 4 as BB, so 8 total means 4 more).\n\nSince they only have 8 chips total and 4 are already in the pot, they have 4 left. So raising to 8 puts them all-in.\n\nWith pocket 8s, I'm happy to get it in against a random hand from a desperate short stack. This is a +EV play that also has tournament equity benefits by potentially eliminating an opponent.\n\nI'll raise to put pressure and get value. Since the minimum raise is 8 and that puts them all-in, that's the right amount.",

They called in hand 32 with a significant amount (25), then made a big raise on the flop (90). This suggests they can have strong hands but also might be aggressive post-flop.\n\n**Hand strength**: 67o is a weak hand. It's not suited, doesn't have high card value, and is easily dominated. In SB, I'm out of position against both BB and MiniMax-M2.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 2 to win a pot of 10, so 5:1 pot odds. This is attractive, but with such a weak hand and being out of position, this is not a good spot.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 85.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots like this. The risk/reward isn't worth it, especially out of position with a weak hand.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. 67o is too weak to play from SB out of position, even with good pot odds. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

This is definitely a raising hand.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in BB, which is out of position postflop, which is a slight disadvantage but manageable.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nThere's 10 chips in the pot (2 from SB + 4 from BB + 4 from limper). Since it's checked to me, I can check and see a free flop, or I can raise to take control.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. KQ is too strong to just check here\n2. The opponent is very tight/passive - likely has a weak/marginal hand\n3. I have position disadvantage, so I want to take control now\n4. Raising will likely fold out their weak hands and build the pot when I likely have the best hand\n5. Minimum raise is to 8 chips (4 more chips)\n\nI should raise here. A standard raise would be 3-4x the limp, so 12-16 chips total. Since minimum is 8, I should raise to at least 12 to get value and apply pressure.\n\nLet me raise to 12 chips (3x the limp).",

I have K-Q on a J-T-2 board, so any Ace or 9 gives me a straight.\n- 8 outs to the straight (4 Aces + 4 Nines)\n- This is about 16% equity on the turn (8/47), or about 31% by the river\n- I also have a backdoor flush draw with Qh (need running hearts)\n\n**Opponent tendencies from the data:**\nSeat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has been very passive:\n- They fold preflop a lot (hands 32-37)\n- When they do play, they check-call a lot (hand 38, 39)\n- They called a turn bet in hand 39\n- In hand 38 they had K-7 and checked down on A-J-5-6-8 board (missed straight draw?)\n- In hand 39 they had 6-4 and hit two pair on 9-3-4-2-6 board\n\nThis opponent seems passive, calling station tendencies. They call preflop, then check-call down.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 26, I can check for free. If I bet, minimum raise is 8.\n\n**Decision:**\nI have a strong draw with 8 outs to the nuts (straight). I should bet for value and to build the pot when I hit. I can also get folds from weaker hands.\n\nGiven the opponent's passive tendencies, they're likely to call with any pair or draw. I should bet to:\n1. Build the pot for when I hit my straight\n2. Charge them for draws\n3. Potentially get value from weaker hands like Jx or Tx\n\nA bet of around 1/2 to 2/3 pot (13-18 chips) seems appropriate. Given the minimum raise is 8, I could bet 16-20.\n\nLet me bet 16 (about 2/3 pot) to charge draws and build the pot.",

Decent hand but not premium.\n\n**Position:** Button - best position in poker. I act last postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 352 chips (44 BB) - healthy stack.\n\n**Current situation:** \n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 12 (4 from SB, 8 from BB)\n- I posted SB of 4\n- I need to call 4 more to see the flop\n- Min raise is to 16\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at DeepSeek-V3.2's recent actions (seat 3, the BB):\n- Generally passive: lots of checking and calling\n- Hand #40: Called preflop twice (4 then 8), folded on flop\n- Hand #39: Called preflop, checked/called turn, checked river\n- Hand #38: Checked turn and river\n\nDeepSeek seems like a relatively passive player who calls preflop but gives up easily postflop.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength:** A9o is decent from the button. Ace-high has good showdown value.\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is a huge advantage.\n3. **Pot odds:** I need to call 4 to win 12 (3:1 pot odds). This is very favorable.\n4. **Opponent tendency:** DeepSeek is passive, which means I can likely steal pots postflop with aggression.\n5. **Stack preservation:** With 44 BB, I can afford to see flops and play poker.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold:** Too tight. I have a decent hand in great position with good pot odds.\n- **Call:** Reasonable. Cheap price to see flop with position.\n- **Raise:** Also reasonable. I could raise to 16 to try to take it down now or build pot when I have position.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have position\n- My hand has decent equity\n- Pot odds are great (3:1)\n- Opponent is passive\n- I can play well postflop from the button\n\nI think calling is the best play. Raising is also fine but might fold out worse hands that I want to keep in. I want to see a cheap flop in position with a hand that can make strong pairs and has decent showdown value.\n\nThe call costs me only 4 more chips (0.5 BB) which is a very small investment relative to my stack and the pot size.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My cards**: As 9c (Ace of spades, 9 of clubs) - This is a decent but marginal hand. Ace-high with a weak kicker.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Best position post-flop, but we're still preflop.\n\n**Stack**: 348 chips (43.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- I posted SB (4) and then called the BB (4 more = 8 total)\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 24 (3x)\n\n**To call**: 16 more chips (24 - 8 = 16)\n\n**Pot odds**: 32 + 16 = 48 in pot, need to call 16 = 3:1 pot odds\n\n**Opponent info**: DeepSeek-V3.2 has 201 chips (25 BB) - they're the short stack at the table.\n\nLooking at their history:\n- Hand 38: Checked turn and river (passive)\n- Hand 39: Called preflop, checked flop and turn, called turn bet, checked river (passive/trappy)\n- Hand 40: Called preflop twice (called a raise), then folded on flop (somewhat loose preflop but can fold)\n\nThis player seems somewhat passive and willing to call preflop, but can fold post-flop.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: A9o is marginal, especially with a 9 kicker. It's dominated by better aces (AT+, AJ+, AQ+, AK) and pairs.\n2. **Position**: Good position, but we need to see a flop to realize our equity.\n3. **Pot odds**: Getting 3:1 which is decent, but...\n4. **Stack sizes**: If I call 16, pot will be 48. If I hit an Ace on flop, I could be dominated. If I hit my 9, I might have best hand but it's vulnerable.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. Calling here with a marginal hand OOP (well, I'm on button but I'd be calling a raise) against a short stack who might be looking to get it in.\n\nThe raise size is 3x (24 from 8) which is standard. Given that DeepSeek-V3.2 is the short stack and has shown they can call preflop and fold postflop, I could call and try to outplay them post-flop in position.\n\nHowever, A9o is really at the bottom of my calling range here. The 16 chips represents about 4.6% of my stack. If I call and miss the flop (which will happen most of the time), I'll likely have to fold to any continuation bet.\n\nLet me think about the math: I need roughly 25% equity to call getting 3:1. Against a typical raising range (22+, AT+, KJ+, QJ+, suited connectors), A9o has about 30-35% equity. So mathematically it's a call.\n\nBut tournament poker is about more than just raw equity. It's about chip preservation and avoiding marginal spots. With a healthy stack, I don't need to take this marginal spot. I can find better spots.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. While the pot odds are decent and I have position, A9o is too marginal against a short stack's raise. I preserve my chips for better spots and avoid being dominated when I hit an Ace.",

The hand has potential but:\n- It's a low suited connector\n- I'm getting poor pot odds (1.5:1)\n- While I'm in position, if I call, I'll likely be heads-up against the BB\n- My stack is healthy enough that I don't need to gamble\n\nThe raise option: I could raise to try to steal the blinds, but:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot, so a steal might work\n- However, if I get called, I'm out of position postflop with a marginal hand\n- A standard raise would be to 16-24 chips, which is 2-3 BB\n\n\n- This represents a significant portion of my stack for a speculative hand\n\nI see multiple compelling reasons to fold. The pot odds are unfavorable, and the hand's potential doesn't justify the risk. With a decent stack and better opportunities ahead, folding seems the most prudent choice. The speculative nature of the hand, combined with the risk of committing chips, makes folding the clear strategic decision.",

This is a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is actually decent position post-flop since I act last.\n\n3. **Action**: \n   - SB posted 4\n   - I posted BB 8\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised to 24 (3x BB)\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 20\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is currently 56 chips (8+4+24+20). I need to call 16 more to see the flop. That's 16/56 = 28.6% pot odds. With J4s, I don't have that kind of equity against a raise and a call.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3): From the recall, they raised to 24 in hand #41 (same sizing as now), and folded in hand #42. They called in hands #39 and #40. They seem somewhat active but not overly aggressive. Their showdown hands have been weak (6h4h, 9cJc, 7sKh, 3dAs).\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): They've been more passive, with lots of checking and folding preflop. They called here which suggests they have something, but their range is likely wide given they've shown down hands like 3h4h, Kd6s, Ad5d, JsQc, 6d6c.\n\n6. **Stack sizes**: I have 340 chips (42.5 BB), so I'm healthy. No need to take marginal spots.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: While I could defend my blind with a suited hand, J4s is just too weak. I'm out of position against two players, and the raise sizing is significant (3x).\n\nThe key factors against calling:\n- Very weak hand (J4s)\n- Facing a raise AND a call (two players showing strength)\n- Would be out of position post-flop\n- No need to take marginal spots with a healthy stack\n\n\n- Poor pot odds compound the unfavorable situation, making a fold the clear strategic choice.\n\nThe decision is straightforward: fold this weak hand and wait for a better opportunity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my memory search results for DeepSeek-V3.2, I can see:\n\n**DeepSeek-V3.2's tendencies:**\n- Very tight/aggressive preflop: Has raised to 24 chips (3x BB) in hands #41 and #43\n- When they raise preflop, they often fold to flop aggression (hand #40, #43)\n- Generally passive postflop: Lots of checking and calling, minimal aggression\n- They do call sometimes (hand #39 called turn bet of 4)\n- Stack size: 197 chips (24.6 BB) - medium stack\n\n**My situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with Ah Ts (ace-ten suited)\n- I have 336 chips (42 BB) - healthy stack\n- It's 4 chips to call (half a BB)\n- I can raise to 16 chips minimum\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Ah Ts is a strong hand on the button, especially suited. Good for stealing, can flop strong top pairs, flush draws, straight draws.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button - best position postflop.\n\n3. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 is in the BB. They've shown a pattern of raising preflop with strong hands, and folding to aggression postflop. They're not overly aggressive postflop.\n\n4. **Action**: MiniMax-M2 folded. It's just me vs DeepSeek-V3.2 in the BB.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: 4 chips to win 12 chips = 3:1 odds. Easy call mathematically.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (42 BB). I can afford to see flops and play poker. Stealing blinds is valuable as blinds increase.\n\n**Decision**: \n- Just calling is too passive with this hand and position\n- Raising to 16 (2x BB) is a standard steal attempt\n- Given DeepSeek-V3.2's tendency to raise preflop with strong hands but fold to postflop pressure, a raise here is good\n- If they call, I have position and can control the pot\n- If they fold, I win the 12 chip pot immediately\n\nI should raise to 16 chips as a standard button steal with a decent hand. This is a good spot to accumulate chips.",

I have Ah Ts.\n\nLet me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Strength**: I have Ace-high with a gutshot straight draw (need a J to make a straight). The board shows Qc Kd 5c, so there's a potential flush draw. I have no pair, no flush draw (only one club), but I do have a gutshot to the nuts (if a J comes, I'd have Broadway straight A-K-Q-J-T).\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button, which is good position. I raised preflop and got called by the BB.\n\n**Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 called my preflop raise. Looking at their history:\n- They fold often preflop (hands 34-37 all folded)\n- They sometimes call and then check-fold on flop (hand 40)\n- They sometimes raise preflop (hands 41, 43) and then fold on flop\n- They seem somewhat passive postflop\n\n**Pot**: 32 chips\n**My stack**: 324 chips (40.5 BB)\n**Amount to call**: 0 (I can check)\n**Legal actions**: fold, check, raise\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. I have a weak hand currently (Ace-high)\n2. I have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs: any Jack) - about 16% chance to hit on turn\n3. There's a flush draw on board which could be scary\n4. I'm in position\n5. My opponent seems passive and has shown tendency to fold to aggression\n\n**Decision**: I should check here. \n- My hand is too weak to bet for value\n- I could consider a continuation bet as a bluff, but with two high cards on board (Q,K), my opponent likely has some piece of it\n- Checking allows me to see a free card and potentially realize my equity if a J comes\n- If I bet and get called, I'm in trouble with Ace-high\n- The pot is small, so there's no urgency to win it right now\n\nI should check and see the turn card. If I hit my Jack, I'll have the nuts and can extract value. If not, I can evaluate based on opponent's action.",

I have Ah Ts.\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (need a Jack)\n- I have Ace-high\n- The board has potential flush and straight draws\n- Opponent checked twice (flop and turn hasn't acted yet)\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have position\n2. Opponent has been passive (checking a lot)\n3. I have some equity with the gutshot\n4. I can represent a strong hand (K, Q, or straight draw)\n5. Checking gives a free card to complete my straight\n\nI think a small bet here is good to:\n- Take down the pot now\n- Build the pot if I hit my straight on river\n- Charge opponent if they're drawing\n- Represent strength\n\nA bet of 16-24 chips seems appropriate (half to 3/4 pot). The minimum raise is to 8, but that's too small. I should bet more like 16-20.\n\nLet me check what I can raise to: minimum raise to 8, but I can raise more. A standard bet would be 16-24 (half pot to 3/4 pot).\n\nI think betting 16 is a good size - it's half pot, shows strength, and doesn't risk too many chips.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. I have Ace-high with a gutshot. The opponent has checked twice. They could have:\n- A weak pair\n- A draw\n- Nothing\n\nIf I bet and they call, I'm in trouble on the river unless I hit my Jack. If I check, I get a free card to hit my 4-outer (approximately 8.5% chance).\n\nBut checking also gives them a free card if they're drawing. However, they've shown passivity.\n\nGiven my opponent's passivity, a small bet might take it down. But checking is also fine to see a free card.\n\nI think checking is the safer play here. I don't have a strong made hand, and while I have some equity, I don't want to build a big pot with just Ace-high. I can check and see the river for free, and if I hit my Jack, I'll have a strong hand. If not, I can decide based on opponent's action.\n\nLet me check: the action is on me, amount to call is 0, so I can check.\n\nI'll check.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**My hand**: Ah Ts (Ace of hearts, Ten of spades)\n**Board**: Qc Kd 5c 9s Jc (Queen, King, Five, Nine, Jack - all clubs except King and Nine)\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: I have Ace-high. The board shows a straight draw possibility (10-Q-K-J-9 = I have 10) and a flush draw (4 clubs on board). Let me check what I actually have:\n   - Straight: I have 10, board has Q-K-J-9 = I have 10,9,J,Q,K = STRAIGHT! Wait, let me recount: 9s, Jc, Qc, Kd - that's 9-10-J-Q-K = STRAIGHT!\n   - Flush: 4 clubs on board (Qc, 5c, Jc, and I need to check if there's another... wait: Qc, 5c, Jc... that's only 3 clubs. Let me recount the board: Qc, Kd, 5c, 9s, Jc. That's 3 clubs (Qc, 5c, Jc). So no flush on board.\n   \n   So I have a straight: 9-10-J-Q-K! That's a very strong hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is good position.\n\n3. **Action**: Preflop I raised, opponent called. Flop: check-check. Turn: check-check. So opponent has shown no aggression.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's history, they tend to:\n   - Fold preflop often (hands 34-37 all folded)\n   - When they do play, they check frequently (hand 38 checked all streets)\n   - They called a turn bet in hand 39\n   - They folded to a flop bet in hand 40\n   - They raised preflop in hands 41 and 43 but folded on flop in hand 43\n   \n   This suggests they're cautious post-flop, often giving up when faced with aggression.\n\n5. **Pot size**: 32 chips. My stack is 324 chips (40.5 BB). This is a relatively small pot.\n\n6. **River situation**: No one has bet the river yet. I have a strong hand (straight). The opponent has checked to me twice (flop and turn), showing weakness.\n\n**Decision**: With a straight, I should definitely bet for value. The question is how much. Given the opponent's tendency to be cautious and fold to aggression, and the fact that they've shown no strength, I should make a value bet that they might call with weaker hands.\n\nGiven the pot is 32, a bet of around 1/2 to 3/4 pot (16-24 chips) seems appropriate. The minimum raise is 8, but I want to bet, not raise. Since the amount to call is 0, I can \"check\" or \"raise\". To bet, I need to use \"raise\" action.\n\nLet me bet 24 chips (3/4 pot) to extract value from hands like two pair, sets, or possibly weaker straights if they have something.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have K\u26639\u2663 (suited, King-high)\n- Position: BTN (excellent position)\n- Stack: 356 chips (44.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 4/8, Pot: 12\n- Need to call 8 to see flop\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (SB): Mixed pattern - sometimes raises to 24, sometimes calls, sometimes folds. Showed down weak hands like 6h4h, 7sKh. Seems somewhat loose/passive.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): More conservative - frequently folds preflop, occasionally calls. Showed down decent hands like 6d6c, Ad5d, JsQc. Seems tighter.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: K9s is a decent but marginal hand. It's suited and has a King, but the kicker is weak.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is huge advantage - I get to act last postflop.\n3. **Stack Size**: 44.5 BB is comfortable but not deep enough to play too loosely.\n4. **Opponents**: Facing SB and BB only. Both seem beatable.\n5. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 8 to win 12 (1.5:1) - not great immediate odds, but position and implied odds help.\n\n**Decision Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight from the button with a suited hand. We're not that short-stacked.\n- **Call**: Reasonable. We have position, suited hand, and both opponents seem beatable. Good implied odds if we hit.\n- **Raise**: Could steal the blinds, but with 44.5 BB, we don't need to be desperate. K9s plays better as a call than a raise.\n\nI think calling is the best play. We want to see a flop in position with a hand that can make strong hands (flush, top pair, straight draws). We're not deep enough to be super speculative, but with position and the right opponents, calling is +EV.\n\nLet me make the call.",

I also have a backdoor flush draw (clubs).\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Pot: 20 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 in BB has checked to me on the turn\n- I have position (BTN)\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n\n**Opponent analysis** (MiniMax-M2):\nFrom the recall data, I can see MiniMax-M2 has been fairly passive:\n- Frequently checks and folds preflop\n- Made a small bet on turn in hand 39 (4 chips)\n- Made a flop bet in hand 43 (16 chips)\n- No showdown information available\n\nThe current board is Qs 4h 9h Qc. This is a paired board (Queens). I have second pair (9s) with a King kicker.\n\n**Hand strength analysis**:\n- I have second pair on a paired board\n- There's a possible flush draw (hearts) out there\n- There's also a possible straight draw (if someone has KJ or JT, but unlikely given the board)\n- My hand is marginal at best\n\n**Position and stack considerations**:\n- I have position (good)\n- I have 348 chips (43.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot is only 20 chips - not huge\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. I have a marginal hand with some showdown value\n2. The opponent has been passive and checked twice (flop and turn)\n3. There's a possible flush draw that could be out there\n4. I'm in position and can control the pot size\n5. If I bet, I might fold out worse hands and get called by better hands\n6. If I check, I get a free river card and can evaluate again\n\nGiven that the opponent has shown passivity and checked twice, and I have a marginal hand with some showdown value, checking seems like the best option. I don't want to build a big pot with second pair on a paired board, and I can get to showdown cheaply or possibly extract value on the river if checked to again.\n\nHowever, I could also consider a small value bet to extract value from worse hands like pocket pairs below 9s, or Ace-high hands. But the risk is that I'm turning my hand into a bluff and might get called by better hands.\n\nI think checking is the safer, more optimal play here given the board texture and opponent's passivity.",

However, they could be:\n- Slowplaying a monster (full house, trips)\n- Have a weak Qx and checking for showdown\n- Have a missed draw and giving up\n- Have a medium strength hand like 9x, 4x, or pocket pair below Q\n\nGiven the board texture and passive action, I should consider:\n\n\nI'll need to carefully evaluate the betting strategy. The pot is relatively small at 20 chips, which suggests a cautious approach might be wise. With my two pair, I'm in a decent position, but the potential for stronger hands exists. The key is to extract value without risking too many chips.\n\nChecking seems like the most prudent move. This allows me to control the pot size and potentially induce a bluff or weaker hand to show down. The passive action throughout the hand indicates my opponent might have a marginal holding, making a check the safest play.\n\nI'll focus on protecting my stack and avoiding unnecessary risks in this tournament scenario. A check keeps the pot manageable and prevents potential chip loss against a stronger range.",

Given my 43.5 BB stack in a tournament, preserving chips is important.

This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n**Position**: SB (Small Blind) - I'm out of position postflop, which makes playing weak hands even more problematic.\n\n**Stack**: 368 chips (46 BB) - This is a healthy stack, I don't need to take risks with garbage hands.\n\n**Pot**: 20 chips\n- SB posted: 4\n- BB posted: 8\n- MiniMax-M2 called: 8\n- I need to call: 4 more chips\n\n**Opponent info**: MiniMax-M2 has been playing somewhat passively - lots of folds preflop (hands 40, 41, 44, 46), with some calls and checks. In hand 43 they called preflop and bet on the flop. They're not super aggressive.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. Hand strength: 7-3 offsuit is in the bottom 10% of starting hands. Very weak.\n2. Position: Out of position makes everything worse\n3. Pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 20, so 5:1 pot odds. This might seem tempting but...\n4. Reverse implied odds: With such a weak hand, if I hit something like a 7, I could lose a lot more chips when dominated by better 7s\n5. Tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, no need to gamble with trash. Better spots will come.\n\nEven though the pot odds are decent (5:1), this hand is simply too weak to play from the SB, especially out of position. The risk of getting into trouble postflop far outweighs the potential reward. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. I need to call 4 chips to see the flop. The pot is 20 chips. That's 5:1 pot odds. With any two cards, sometimes you might consider it. But 7-3 offsuit is just so bad, and I'll be out of position. Even if I hit a 7, I could be dominated. If I hit two pair, someone could have a straight. It's just not worth it.\n\nThe correct play is to fold. Save the 4 chips and wait for a better hand and/or better position.",

Q6o is generally not a profitable hand to play.\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop\n- Only 2 active opponents: SB (Seat 3) and BB (Seat 4)\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- My stack: 368 chips (46 BB) - healthy stack\n- SB (DeepSeek-V3.2): 193 chips (24 BB) - short stack\n- BB (MiniMax-M2): 349 chips (43.6 BB) - similar to mine\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n\n**DeepSeek-V3.2 (SB):**\n- Has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 42, 45, 46)\n- Made raises in hands 43 (24 chips) and 47 (28 chips)\n- When they call, they tend to play passively post-flop (check-fold in hand 44)\n- Seems to have a tight-aggressive style but folds frequently\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (BB):**\n- More calling station tendencies (called 20 in hand 43, called 8 in hand 47)\n- Defends BB by calling\n- Can be passive post-flop (lots of checking in hand 45)\n- Showdown hands suggest they play a wide range (Ad5d, JsQc, 3h4h, Kd6s)\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 12 chips\n- Need to call 8 chips\n- Getting 1.5:1 odds\n- This is not good enough for Q6o\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 46 BB\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Q6o is a fold in most situations\n- Even with position advantage, this hand doesn't have enough equity\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite being on the Button, Q6o is simply too weak to play profitably here. The opponents don't have extreme tendencies that would make me want to steal with such a weak hand. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nThe only argument for playing would be if both opponents were extremely tight and I could steal the blinds frequently, but the data shows MiniMax-M2 defends their BB, and DeepSeek-V3.2 does occasionally raise.",

In hand 43 they raised to 24 then folded on flop. Seems somewhat aggressive but can fold.\n- **MiniMax-M2**: More passive - lots of checking, some folding. Called in hand 43 then bet on flop. In hand 47 called 8 then folded. Now they're re-raising which is unusual for them.\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm out of position as BB\n- Both opponents have position on me post-flop\n- I have a healthy stack at 45 BB\n- Tournament considerations: I should preserve my stack and not get involved in marginal spots\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. K4o is trash, I'm out of position, facing a 3-bet from a normally passive player (MiniMax-M2), and I'd be investing 24 chips (6% of my stack) into a pot where I'm likely dominated. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify calling with such a weak hand.\n\nEven though MiniMax-M2 is normally passive, their re-raise here suggests real strength. And DeepSeek-V3.2's initial raise also suggests they have something. I'm likely up against two real hands.\n\nFold is the only correct play here.",

Not a great hand, but I have position (button) and it's a steal situation.\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - Best position postflop, can act last on all streets.\n\n**Stack**: 356 chips (44.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Blinds are 4/8, pot is 12\n- I need to call 4 more chips to see the flop\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 is in BB with 81 chips (10 BB) - short stack\n- Only DeepSeek-V3.2 is active besides me\n\n**Opponent Analysis**:\nFrom the recall data on DeepSeek-V3.2:\n- Hand 44: Folded on river\n- Hands 45, 46: Folded preflop\n- Hand 47: Raised preflop to 28 (3.5x BB)\n- Hand 48: Folded preflop  \n- Hand 49: Raised to 20, then called 12 more (so faced a reraise), then called flop 36, turn 36, folded river\n\nThis suggests DeepSeek-V3.2 is somewhat active but also folds frequently. In hand 49 they raised but then called down and folded river, suggesting they can have marginal hands.\n\n**Decision Factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: A3o is weak, but it's a steal attempt from button\n2. **Position**: Excellent position on button\n3. **Opponent**: DeepSeek is short-stacked (81 chips = 10 BB) and has shown they can fold\n4. **Pot odds**: Calling 4 to win 12 = 3:1 odds, which is decent\n5. **Tournament**: I'm healthy stacked, can afford to play speculative hands in position\n\n**Options**:\n- **Fold**: Too tight, I have position and decent odds\n- **Call**: Could see a flop in position, but A3o doesn't play great multi-way and I'm heads-up vs BB\n- **Raise**: Steal attempt. Minimum raise to 16 (2x BB). Given opponent is short-stacked and has folded preflop a lot, this seems like a good spot to steal.\n\nI think raising to steal is the best play here. The opponent is short-stacked and has shown a tendency to fold preflop. Even if they call, I have position and can evaluate on the flop.\n\nLet me raise to 16 (minimum raise). This is a standard steal size and puts pressure on the short stack.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: As 3h - Ace with a weak kicker. This is a marginal hand, especially when facing aggression.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position post-flop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 344 chips (43 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n4. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 in the BB with only 8 chips left (1 BB). This is a very short stack.\n\n5. **Action**: \n   - I raised to 16 (2x)\n   - BB re-raised to 81 (about 10x)\n   - I need to call 65 more to a pot of 97\n\n6. **Opponent analysis from recall**: \n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 has been fairly active preflop with raises in hands #47 and #49\n   - They folded several times preflop as well\n   - In hand #49, they raised, then called a re-raise, and continued calling on flop and turn before folding river\n   - They seem capable of making moves and playing aggressively\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I need to call 65 to win 97, which is about 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed.\n\n8. **Situation analysis**: \n   - Opponent only has 8 chips left after their raise (they raised to 81 but only had 8 chips)\n   - Wait, let me re-read: DeepSeek-V3.2 has 8 chips total. They raised to 81, which means they must be all-in for 8 chips, not 81. The raise amount shown is likely the total amount they're putting in, but they can only put in 8.\n   - Actually, looking at the stack: \"DeepSeek-V3.2 - 8 chips\" - this is their current stack.\n   - So the raise to 81 is impossible unless they had more chips. Let me reconsider...\n   - The raise to 81 might be what they're trying to make it, but they can only put in their remaining 8 chips.\n   - Wait, the action says \"Seat 3 raise 81\" - this suggests they have at least 81 chips to raise with.\n   - But the player list shows \"DeepSeek-V3.2 - 8 chips\"\n   - This is contradictory. Let me assume the stack size is current after posting the BB of 8, so they started the hand with 16 chips, posted 8, and now have 8 left. But that doesn't make sense either because they couldn't raise to 81.\n   \n   Actually, I think the player list shows current stacks, and the action shows what happened. If they raised to 81, they must have had at least 81 chips. The \"8 chips\" might be outdated or incorrect. Or perhaps it's showing they have 8 big blinds? No, it says \"8 chips\".\n\nLet me reconsider: The blinds are 4/8, so 8 chips is 1 BB. It's possible the player list is showing stacks in big blinds, not chips. But it says \"344 chips (43.0 BB)\" for me, so it's showing both.\n\nI think the most logical interpretation is that DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 81, which means they have at least that many chips. The \"8 chips\" in the player list might be an error, or it might represent something else.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll focus on the action: I need to call 65 to win 97, getting about 1.5:1 pot odds.\n\n9. **Hand equity**: With A3o, against a typical 3-betting range, I likely have around 30-35% equity at best. Against a very tight range, it could be worse.\n\n10. **Opponent's range**: Given they've been active and made a large 3-bet (from 16 to 81), they likely have a strong hand. The size suggests they want to either:\n    - Get value with a strong hand (QQ+, AK)\n    - Force me to fold with a weaker hand\n    - But with only 1 BB shown, they might be desperate\n\n11. **My decision**: The pot odds are not great for A3o. I need about 40% equity, and I likely don't have it against a 3-betting range. Even if the opponent is desperate with a short stack, A3o is still dominated by many hands.\n\n12. **Tournament considerations**: With 43 BB, I'm not desperate. I can wait for better spots. Calling here would be marginal at best.\n\nI should fold.",

This looks like a desperate move from a short stack.\n\n9. **My situation**: I have a healthy stack of 43 BB. This is a marginal spot with a weak ace. While the opponent is aggressive and might be bluffing, A3o is just too weak to call a 3-bet with, especially when I'm out of position post-flop (even though I'm on the button, I'll be first to act if we both check).\n\nThe aggressive 3-bet from a short stack could be a desperation move, but A3o is just not strong enough to call. I should fold and preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nLet me reconsider - actually, the opponent only has 8 chips total, but they raised to 81. That doesn't make sense mathematically. Let me recalculate - they posted BB of 8, so they had at least 8 chips. If they raised to 81, they must have had at least 81 chips. The \"8 chips\" shown might be after posting the BB, but that would mean they started with 89 chips total, which is still very short.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: \"Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 8 chips\" - this is their current stack after posting the BB. So they started the hand with at least 89 chips (81 + 8). This is still a short stack of ~11 BB.\n\nGiven their aggressive history and short stack, this could be a wide range. However, A3o is still too weak to call a 3-bet, even from an aggressive short stack. The kicker is terrible, and I'm dominated by any better ace.\n\nI should fold.",

DeepSeek-V3.2 is quite aggressive from the SB, frequently raising. They've made raises of 24, 28, 20, and a big 3-bet of 81.\n2. MiniMax-M2 is also aggressive, especially when they enter pots. They 3-bet in hand 49 and bet all three streets.\n3. DeepSeek has shown they'll fold to pressure (folded to flop bet in 43, folded to river bet in 44, folded to river bet in 49).\n4. Both opponents have shown aggressive tendencies but also capability to fold.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\nAcTc is a strong hand on the button. It's:\n- A decent Ace that plays well post-flop\n- Suited, giving flush potential\n- Good stealing hand\n- Can dominate weaker Aces and Tens\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN, the best position. I have 43 BB which is a healthy stack.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- I have a strong hand in great position\n- Both opponents have shown aggression, which means they can have wide ranges\n- DeepSeek in SB has been very active and aggressive\n- MiniMax in BB has also shown aggression when they play\n- I want to take control of the hand with my strong hand\n- Raising can isolate one opponent or take down the blinds\n- With 43 BB, I have room to play post-flop\n\n**Recommendation:** Raise to about 3x the big blind (24 chips) to:\n1. Build the pot with a strong hand\n2. Isolate one opponent\n3. Take control of the hand\n4. Put pressure on the aggressive opponents\n\nIf I get 3-bet, I can evaluate based on sizing and opponent tendencies. Given DeepSeek's big 3-bet in hand 50 (81 chips), I should be prepared to fold if they make a large 3-bet, but call smaller ones.\n\nLet me raise to 24.",

Risky if they have a draw.\n- **Bet**: Protect my hand against draws, get value from weaker hands. But what size?\n\n\nThe board texture demands a strategic value bet. Two diamonds create potential flush draws, while connected cards suggest straight possibilities. A carefully sized bet can protect my hand while extracting value. I'll need to balance between charging draws and not overcommitting with a potentially vulnerable top pair. The opponent's check indicates possible weakness, making a probing bet attractive. My button position gives me control, but I must be mindful of the stack depths and potential drawing hands that could challenge my current holding.\n\nA moderate bet around 26-32 chips seems optimal - substantial enough to discourage draws while maintaining flexibility for future streets. This sizing pressures opponents with marginal hands and sets up potential later-street decisions without risking my entire stack prematurely.\n\nI'll bet 28 chips to protect my hand and gather information about my opponent's potential holdings.",

In hand 49 they were very aggressive with multiple streets of betting.\n\n**My Analysis:**\nI have a strong hand with multiple ways to improve:\n1. Top pair with Ace kicker - likely best hand right now\n2. Nut flush draw - any club gives me the nut flush\n3. If they have a straight draw with 7-8, I'm currently ahead\n4. I have 12 outs: 9 clubs for flush + 3 remaining tens (but I already have top pair)\n\nThe pot is 108 and I have 292 behind. This is a good spot to build the pot with my strong hand + draw.\n\nI should bet for value and to protect my hand. I don't want to give free cards to potential straight draws or weaker flush draws.\n\n**Decision:** I should make a value bet. The minimum raise is 28, but with the pot at 108, I should bet larger - perhaps around 60-80 chips to build the pot and charge draws.\n\nLet me bet around 70-80 chips, which is a solid value bet with my top pair + nut flush draw.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: As 6s - Ace of spades and 6 of spades. This is a decent suited Ace hand, but the kicker is weak. I have potential for nut flushes, but straight possibilities are limited.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position at the table. I act last postflop.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 388 chips (48.5 BB)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB): 105 chips (13.1 BB) - This is a short stack\n\n4. **Opponent behavior**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's recent actions:\n   - They frequently raise preflop (hands 41, 43, 47, 49, 50, 52)\n   - They fold to pressure sometimes (hands 42, 45, 46, 48, 51)\n   - In hand 50, they raised 81 which was a big portion of their stack\n   - In hand 52 (most recent), they raised 101 which is almost their entire stack\n\n5. **Current situation**: \n   - Blinds are 4/8, so I'm posting SB (4 chips)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 is BB with 105 chips\n   - It's folded to me\n   - I need to call 4 more chips to see a flop\n   - Minimum raise is to 16\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I'm in decent shape with 48.5 BB\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 is short-stacked at 13.1 BB\n   - The other players are either folded or out\n\n7. **Decision factors**:\n   - With A6s on the button vs a short-stacked BB who has been aggressive, this is a good spot to raise\n   - I can steal the blinds or get called by worse hands\n   - If I get 3-bet, I can easily fold\n   - The suited Ace has good playability postflop\n   - I have position advantage\n\n8. **Sizing**: Minimum raise is 16. Given that the BB is short-stacked and has been aggressive, I could:\n   - Raise to 16 (2x BB) - standard steal size\n   - Raise to 20-24 - to put more pressure on the short stack\n   \nI think raising to 20 is a good size - it's enough to put pressure but not committing too many chips. This gives me fold equity against the short stack while maintaining a good risk/reward ratio.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The minimum raise is 16, which is 2x BB. Given that:\n- I'm on the button\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 is short-stacked and has shown aggression\n- I have a playable hand (A6s)\n- I want to apply pressure but not risk too much\n\nA standard raise to 16 (2x BB) is appropriate here. It's a good steal size from the button. If they 3-bet, I can fold. If they call, I have position and a decent hand to play postflop.\n\nLet me raise to 16.",

My opponent called my preflop raise, which suggests they have some hand strength. They could have:\n- Any King or Jack (top pair)\n- A club draw\n- Pocket pairs\n- Straight draws (QT, Q9, T9)\n\nWith Ace-high and a backdoor flush draw, I have some equity but I'm likely behind. However, this is a good spot for a continuation bet because:\n1. I raised preflop and should represent strength\n2. The board is scary with two high cards\n3. My opponent is short-stacked and may fold to pressure\n4. I have position and can control the action\n\nI should make a small continuation bet to see where I stand and potentially take down the pot now. A bet of around 16-20 chips (half pot) would be appropriate.\n\nLet me make a continuation bet of 16 chips (half pot) to put pressure on the short stack.",

They've made several large raises (20, 81, 101) and seem to play a wide range. They folded on the river in hand 49 after calling multiple streets, suggesting they can be pushed off hands.\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (BB):**\n- Hand 49: Bet 36 on turn and river (showing aggression)\n- Hand 50: Folded preflop\n- Hand 51: Called 16 preflop, checked flop, called 28, checked turn, folded turn\n- Hand 52: Folded preflop\n- Hand 53: Folded preflop\n\nMiniMax seems more selective preflop, folding most hands (3 out of 5), but showing postflop aggression when they do play. They folded on the turn in hand 51 after calling flop.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A5o is a marginal hand. It's dominated by better aces (AJ, AQ, AK) and has poor kicker. However, it has some playability due to the ace.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last postflop.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: DeepSeek is short with 93 chips (about 12 BB). This is critical - they're in push/fold territory. MiniMax has a healthy stack similar to mine.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: DeepSeek has been aggressive and might shove preflop. MiniMax is more selective but plays aggressively postflop.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 12 (1.5:1), which is good immediate odds.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. I should avoid marginal spots that could jeopardize my tournament life. DeepSeek is desperate and might shove.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- If I call 8 and DeepSeek shoves for 93, I'd have to call 85 more to win 109 (about 1.28:1). With A5o, that's not great against a short-stack's shoving range which likely includes many better aces, pairs, and broadway cards.\n- If I raise, I might isolate DeepSeek but risk getting re-raised all-in by them or called by MiniMax with a better hand.\n- The button gives me position advantage postflop if both call.\n\n**Best play**: I think the optimal play here is to **fold**. Here's why:\n- A5o is too weak to call against a short-stacked opponent who might shove\n- Even if I call and DeepSeek doesn't shove, I'm likely out of position postflop against MiniMax (though I'm on button, DeepSeek is SB so they act first)\n- The kicker is terrible - I'm dominated by so many hands\n- I preserve my healthy stack for better spots\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. I'm on the BUTTON, so I have position on BOTH players postflop. And the call is only 8 chips (1 BB) into a pot of 12. That's good pot odds. \n\nBut the main issue is DeepSeek's short stack. If they shove (which is likely given their aggression and stack size), I'll be forced to call 85 more chips with A5o. That's a -EV spot.\n\nLet me think about raising. If I raise to something like 24-32:\n- DeepSeek might fold their marginal hands or shove with their strong hands\n- MiniMax might fold their marginal hands or call with strong hands\n\nGiven DeepSeek's aggression and short stack, they could easily shove over my raise. With A5o, I don't want to call a shove.\n\nI think the safest and most profitable"

I should avoid marginal spots that could jeopardize my tournament life. DeepSeek is desperate and might shove.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- If I call 8 and DeepSeek shoves for 93, I'd have to call 85 more to win 109 (about 1.28:1). With A5o, that's not great against a short-stack's shoving range which likely includes many better aces, pairs, and broadway cards.\n- If I raise, I might isolate DeepSeek but risk getting re-raised all-in by them or called by MiniMax with a better hand.\n- The button gives me position advantage postflop if both call.\n\n**Best play**: I think the optimal play here is to **fold**. Here's why:\n- A5o is too weak to call against a short-stacked opponent who might shove\n- Even if I call and DeepSeek doesn't shove, I'm likely out of position postflop against MiniMax (though I'm on button, DeepSeek is SB so they act first)\n- The kicker is terrible - I'm dominated by so many hands\n- I preserve my healthy stack for better spots\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. I'm on the BUTTON, so I have position on BOTH players postflop. And the call is only 8 chips (1 BB) into a pot of 12. That's good pot odds. \n\nBut the main issue is DeepSeek's short stack. If they shove (which is likely given their aggression and stack size), I'll be forced to call 85 more chips with A5o. That's a -EV spot.\n\nLet me think about raising. If I raise to something like 24-32:\n- DeepSeek might fold their marginal hands or shove with their strong hands\n- MiniMax might fold their marginal hands or call with strong hands\n\nGiven DeepSeek's aggression and short stack, they could easily shove over my raise. With A5o, I don't want to call a shove.\n\nI think the safest and most profitable",

This is a decent hand, especially in position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Seat 1), which is out of position if I just call or raise.\n\n3. **Current action**: \n   - Seat 4 (SB) posted 4 and folded\n   - I posted BB of 8\n   - Seat 3 called 4 (which is a limp, since blinds were 4/8)\n   - Now it's back to me with no additional amount to call\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**: Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has been active:\n   - They've made several preflop raises (81, 101, 93 chips)\n   - They've called and then folded on later streets multiple times\n   - They called 4 chips here, which is unusual given their previous aggressive behavior\n   \n   The fact that they just called 4 (a limp) when the BB is 8 is very strange. This suggests they might be trying to see a cheap flop or they have a weaker hand than usual.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I can check and see the flop for free, or I can raise to take control.\n\n6. **Stack sizes**: I have 400 chips (50 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With a 50 BB stack, I can afford to play speculative hands like suited aces, especially when I can see the flop cheaply.\n\nGiven that I can see the flop for free (check) and I have a suited ace that plays well postflop, I should check. Raising would be an option if I wanted to isolate, but since I'm out of position and the opponent has shown aggression in the past, checking to see a free flop with my suited ace is the best play here.\n\nThe opponent's limp is suspicious given their previous aggressive pattern, but I shouldn't overplay A4s out of position. Checking is the standard and optimal play here.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 9h 2d - This is a very weak hand, one of the worst in poker (offsuit, low cards, no straight potential).\n\n**Position**: BB (Big Blind) - I'm out of position post-flop.\n\n**Stack**: 404 chips (50.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 4, then raised to 16\n- I need to call 8 more chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's history from the recall:\n- They fold preflop frequently (hands 46, 50, 52, 53, 55)\n- They raise occasionally (hand 49 raised to 32 preflop, then bet aggressively on all streets)\n- They call sometimes (hands 47, 51, 54)\n- In hand 49, they showed down Td 7d and were very aggressive\n- In hand 54, they called 85 preflop (big bet) and then bet 85 on flop\n\nThis opponent seems to play a mix of styles - sometimes tight, sometimes aggressive. The raise to 16 from SB could be a steal attempt or could be a strong hand.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, so 3:1 odds. This is good pot odds, but...\n\n**Hand Equity**: 9-2 offsuit has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a random hand, 9-2o only wins about 38% of the time. Against a typical raising range, it's much worse (probably 20-25% at best).\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: \n- I have a healthy stack of 50.5 BB\n- There's no need to get involved with such a weak hand\n- Even though pot odds are decent, the hand has very poor playability post-flop\n- Being out of position makes it even worse\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is an easy fold. 9-2 offsuit is a trash hand that should almost never be played, especially out of position against a raise. The pot odds don't compensate for the terrible hand strength and poor post-flop playability.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ks As - This is the best starting hand in poker (pocket rockets, but suited). It's a premium hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. I get to act last on every street.\n\n3. **Stack**: 400 chips (50 BB) - This is a healthy stack, not too short, not too deep.\n\n4. **Opponent**: Only MiniMax-M2 is active with 506 chips in the Big Blind. Everyone else has folded.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 12 chips (3:1 odds). With AA, this is trivial.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: Let me review what I found:\n   - MiniMax-M2 has been fairly active preflop\n   - They've raised preflop in hands #49 (32 chips) and #56 (16 chips)\n   - They've called preflop raises multiple times\n   - They seem to be a straightforward player who bets when they have something\n   \n7. **Strategic considerations**:\n   - With AA on the button, I want to build the pot\n   - I have position advantage\n   - My opponent has a healthy stack to play with\n   - I should raise for value and to isolate\n   - Standard raise size would be 3x the big blind = 24 chips, or perhaps a bit larger since I'm out of position to the BB\n\n8. **Raise sizing**: The minimum raise is 16, but with AA I should raise more. A standard raise would be 3x BB = 24 chips, or maybe 2.5x-3x given my position advantage. Since I need to put in 4 more to call, and minimum raise is 16 total, a good raise would be to 24-32 chips.\n\nGiven I have position and a premium hand against one opponent, I should raise to build the pot. I'll go with a standard 3x raise to 24 chips.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the raise sizing. The big blind is 8, so:\n- Call would be 4 more (to match the 8)\n- Minimum raise is 16 total (which would be a raise of 8 over the BB)\n- A standard 3x BB raise would be 24 total\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's history, they made a raise to 16 in hand #56, which is exactly 2x the BB. In hand #49, they raised to 32 which is 4x the BB.\n\nGiven I have the absolute nuts preflop and position, I should raise to either:\n1. 24 (3x BB) - standard sizing\n\n\n2. 32 (4x BB) - to match their previous large raise\n\nI'll go with 24 as it's a standard sizing that builds the pot without being overly suspicious. This approach balances value extraction with maintaining a strategic edge, encouraging my opponent to potentially call or re-raise with a weaker hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** Ks As - Top pair with top kicker on a K-7-2 rainbow board. This is a very strong hand.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button, which is good position.\n\n**Stack:** 380 chips (47.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Board:** 7h Kd 2c - Rainbow board with no flush draws. Only straight draw would be something like 3-4-5 or 4-5-6, which is unlikely given the action.\n\n**Pot:** 64 chips\n**Amount to call:** 16 chips\n**Pot odds:** 80:16 or 5:1 - Very good odds.\n\n**Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 in the BB. Let me review their recent actions:\n- Hand 56: Preflop raise 16\n- Hand 55: Preflop fold\n- Hand 54: Preflop call 85, then flop bet 85\n- Hand 53: Preflop fold\n- Hand 52: Preflop fold\n- Hand 51: Preflop call 16, flop check, call 28, turn check-fold\n- Hand 50: Preflop fold\n- Hand 49: Preflop raise 32, then aggressive betting on flop (36), turn (36), river (36)\n\nMiniMax seems to play aggressively when they have strong hands (hand 49, 54, 56) but also folds frequently. Their flop bet of 16 into a 64 chip pot is a small bet (25% pot).\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** I have top pair, top kicker (AK). This is a very strong hand on this dry board.\n2. **Opponent's range:** They called preflop from BB. Could have Kx, pocket pairs, suited connectors, etc. Their small flop bet could be:\n   - A weak king trying to \"see where they're at\"\n   - A pair like 77 or 22 (but 22 would have flopped a set)\n   - A bluff with air\n   - A strong hand trying to induce action (less likely given bet sizing)\n3. **Equity:** I'm likely ahead of most of their range. Only behind 77, 22, K7, K2, and 72. \n\nI have a commanding chip lead and a premium hand. The small flop bet suggests vulnerability, giving me an excellent opportunity to apply pressure with a substantial raise. My position and chip stack allow me to control the hand's tempo and potentially force a difficult decision from my opponent. A raise here can extract maximum value and potentially take down the pot immediately.",

They don't always fold to pressure.\n\n**Hand history this hand**:\n- Preflop: I raised to 24, opponent called (showing some strength)\n- Flop: Opponent bet 16 (small bet), I raised to 64, opponent called (showing they have something)\n- Turn: Opponent bets 48 into a pot of ~176\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **My hand strength**: Top pair, top kicker. Very strong hand on this board. Only losing to sets (77, 22, KK - unlikely), two pairs (KJ, K7, J7), or possibly a slowplayed AA.\n\n2. **Opponent's range**: Based on their actions:\n   - They called my preflop raise\n   - They bet flop (small), called my raise\n   - They bet turn\n   \n   This suggests they have a strong hand. Possible holdings:\n   - KQ, KJ, KT (top pair weaker kicker)\n   - Sets (77, 22)\n   - Two pairs (KJ, K7)\n   - Maybe a bluff or draw (but board is relatively dry)\n   \n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 48 to win 224 (pot) = 4.67:1 pot odds. I only need ~17.6% equity to call. I definitely have more than that.\n\n4. **Position**: I have position, which is good. I can control the pot size on the river.\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: I have 316 chips left, pot is 224. This is a significant pot.\n\n**Decision**: \nI have a very strong hand (top pair, top kicker). The opponent is showing strength but could have many worse hands (KQ, KJ, KT). The board is relatively dry with no flush draws. \n\nI should raise here to:\n1. Get value from worse hands\n2. Charge any draws (though there aren't many)\n3. Build the pot with my strong hand\n\nGiven the pot size (224) and the bet (48), a raise to about 150-180 seems appropriate. This would be a raise of about 100-130 more.\n\nMinimum raise is 96, but that's too small. I want to make a substantial raise that:\n- Gets value from worse hands\n- Doesn't commit my entire stack yet\n- Allows me to fold if the opponent shoves and I'm beat\n\nLet me raise to 180 total (132 more). This puts pressure on the opponent while keeping some chips behind if things go wrong.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The pot is 224, opponent bet 48. If I raise to 180:\n- Opponent would need to call 132 more\n- Pot would be 404 if they call\n- I'd have 136 left\n\nThat's a bit too committal. Let me raise to 150 instead:\n- Opponent calls 102 more\n- Pot would be 374 if they call\n- I'd have 166 left\n\nThis gives me better stack flexibility on the river.\n\nWait, let me check the minimum raise again. It's 96, which is just a min-raise. I should raise more than that.\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive tendencies shown in hand 49 (betting all streets), they might call a larger raise with worse hands.\n\nI'll go with a raise to 160 total (112 more). This is a solid raise that:\n- Gets value from worse hands\n- Charges them appropriately\n- Keeps me from being pot-committed\n- Gives me room to maneuver on the river\n\nActually, looking at my stack of 316, if I raise to 160, I'll have 156 left.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: Ks As (Ace-King suited spades)\n**Position**: BTN\n**Stack**: 316 chips (39.5 BB)\n**Board**: 7h Kd 2c Jh\n**Pot**: 224 chips\n**To call**: 48 chips\n\n**Current situation**: \n- I have top pair (Kings) with top kicker (Ace)\n- Board: 7h Kd 2c Jh - Rainbow board with no flush draw\n- Possible straight draws: Q-10 would make a straight if a 10 comes\n- I have position on the opponent (BTN vs BB)\n\n**Opponent (MiniMax-M2) tendencies**:\nFrom the recall, I can see:\n- Hand 49: Made a preflop raise, then bet flop, turn, and river (very aggressive line)\n- Hand 51: Called preflop, checked flop, called a bet, then check-folded turn\n- Hand 54: Called a large preflop bet (85), then bet 85 on flop\n- Hand 56: Made a small preflop raise (16)\n\nThe opponent seems to be capable of both aggressive betting and calling large bets. They don't always fold to pressure.\n\n**Hand history this hand**:\n- Preflop: I raised to 24, opponent called (showing some strength)\n- Flop: Opponent bet 16 (small bet), I raised to 64, opponent called (showing they have something)\n- Turn: Opponent bets 48 into a pot of ~176\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **My hand strength**: Top pair, top kicker. Very strong hand on this board. Only losing to sets (77, 22, KK - unlikely), two pairs (KJ, K7, J7), or possibly a slowplayed AA.\n\n2. **Opponent's range**: Based on their actions:\n   - They called my preflop raise\n   - They bet flop (small), called my raise\n   - They bet turn\n   \n   This suggests they have a strong hand. Possible holdings:\n   - KQ, KJ, KT (top pair weaker kicker)\n   - Sets (77, 22)\n   - Two pairs (KJ, K7)\n   - Maybe a bluff or draw (but board is relatively dry)\n   \n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 48 to win 224 (pot) = 4.67:1 pot odds. I only need ~17.6% equity to call. I definitely have more than that.\n\n4. **Position**: I have position, which is good. I can control the pot size on the river.\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: I have 316 chips left, pot is 224. This is a significant pot.\n\n**Decision**: \nI have a very strong hand (top pair, top kicker). The opponent is showing strength but could have many worse hands (KQ, KJ, KT). The board is relatively dry with no flush draws. \n\nI should raise here to:\n1. Get value from worse hands\n2. Charge any draws (though there aren't many)\n3. Build the pot with my strong hand\n\nGiven the pot size (224) and the bet (48), a raise to about 150-180 seems appropriate. This would be a raise of about 100-130 more.\n\nMinimum raise is 96, but that's too small. I want to make a substantial raise that:\n- Gets value from worse hands\n- Doesn't commit my entire stack yet\n- Allows me to fold if the opponent shoves and I'm beat\n\nLet me raise to 180 total (132 more). This puts pressure on the opponent while keeping some chips behind if things go wrong.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The pot is 224, opponent bet 48. If I raise to 180:\n- Opponent would need to call 132 more\n- Pot would be 404 if they call\n- I'd have 136 left\n\nThat's a bit too committal. Let me raise to 150 instead:\n- Opponent calls 102 more\n- Pot would be 374 if they call\n- I'd have 166 left\n\nThis gives me better stack flexibility on the river.\n\nWait, let me check the minimum raise again. It's 96, which is just a min-raise. I should raise more than that.\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive tendencies shown in hand 49 (betting all streets), they might call a larger raise with worse hands.\n\nI'll go with a raise to 160 total (112 more). This is a solid raise that:\n- Gets value from worse hands\n- Charges them appropriately\n- Keeps me from being pot-committed\n- Gives me room to maneuver on the river\n\nActually, looking at my stack of 316, if I raise to 160, I'll have 156 left.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n**My hand**: Ks As (Ace-King suited spades)\n**Board**: 7h Kd 2c Jh 3s\n**Position**: BTN\n**Stack**: 156 chips (19.5 BB)\n**Pot**: 496 chips\n\nI have top pair with top kicker (King with Ace kicker). The board is 7h Kd 2c Jh 3s, which is relatively dry - no flush possible (4 different suits), and no straight possible. \n\nThe action has been very aggressive throughout:\n- Preflop: I raised to 24, opponent called\n- Flop: I raised their bet from 16 to 64, they called\n- Turn: I raised their bet from 48 to 160, they called\n- River: They checked to me\n\nThe pot is now 496 chips and I only have 156 chips left. This means the pot is about 3.2x my stack.\n\nLooking at opponent's history (Seat 4 - MiniMax-M2):\n- They've been fairly active and aggressive\n- They called my turn raise which was substantial\n- They just checked on the river\n\nGiven the board texture and the action, I have a strong hand. However, I need to consider what hands my opponent could have that would call all the way to the river and then check:\n- They could have a King with a weaker kicker\n- They could have two pair (KJ, K7, K3, J7, J3, 73)\n- They could have a set (77, 22, JJ but these are less likely given preflop action)\n- They could be bluffing or have a missed draw\n\nSince they checked to me on the river, they're likely either:\n1. Weak and giving up\n2. Inducing a bet with a monster\n3. Have a marginal hand that can't call a big bet\n\nGiven my stack size (156) relative to the pot (496), I should go all-in. If they fold, I win a big pot. If they call, I'm getting great pot odds and I have a strong hand that likely wins against their range.\n\nLet me check the minimum raise amount: 112 chips. Since I only have 156, I can raise to 156 (all-in).",

This is a marginal hand at best. The King is very scary, and my kicker is terrible (3). If MiniMax has any King, I'm way behind. If they have a flush draw, they're drawing to beat me. If they have a better 7 (like A7, 87, etc.), I'm also behind.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven:\n1. Very weak hand (bottom pair, bad kicker)\n2. Scary board (King present)\n3. Out of position\n4. Opponent seems aggressive (could be betting with many hands)\n5. Pot is tiny (16 chips) - not worth fighting for\n6. My stack is healthy - no need to take marginal spots\n\nI should check. There's no reason to bet here with such a weak hand. I want to see a free card or control the pot size. If MiniMax bets after I check, I'll likely fold unless it's a very small bet.\n\nLet me check to see what happens.",

I have bottom pair. \n\nGiven that:\n1. My opponent checked the flop after I checked, suggesting weakness\n2. The turn brought a 6s, adding another spade and completing some straight draws\n3. I have a weak pair that might be ahead but is vulnerable\n4. I have a healthy stack and don't need to take risks\n5. My opponent has shown aggression but also checked the flop\n\nI should check here. Betting would be risky with just bottom pair on a coordinated board, and I want to see a free showdown if possible. If they bet the turn, I can decide whether to call based on the size, but checking keeps the pot small with my marginal hand.\n\nI don't need to use any more tools - I have enough information about my opponent's tendencies.",

I have bottom pair with a 3 kicker. The board is coordinated with both flush and straight draws. My opponent is aggressive and has been betting. Even though the pot odds are decent (25% needed), my hand is likely beat by:\n- Any King\n- Any better 7 (K7, A7, etc.)\n- Any two pair\n- Any straight draw that hit\n- Any flush draw that might be semibluffing\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive nature and the coordinated board, I should fold. My hand has little showdown value and is easily dominated. I don't want to invest more chips with such a weak holding.\n\nI should fold.",

Hand #58: MiniMax-M2 checked preflop, then bet turn\n\nPatterns I see:\n- MiniMax-M2 is aggressive and likes to bet, especially when they have position or initiative\n- They call preflop raises fairly often (hands #51, #54, #57)\n- They 3-bet preflop with marginal hands (K4o in #49)\n- They frequently continuation bet and barrel multiple streets\n- They've shown willingness to call down with marginal holdings\n\nWith Q4o on the button:\n- This is a trash hand (unsuited, 4-gap)\n- I'm out of position against an aggressive player\n- I have a healthy stack (99.5 BB)\n\n\n- I could potentially steal, but MiniMax-M2's aggressive nature makes this risky\n- The 3:1 pot odds aren't compelling enough to call with such a weak hand\n\nI'll fold this trash hand. The combination of poor card quality, positional disadvantage, and opponent's aggressive playing style makes this an easy decision. No point risking chips on a hand with such low potential.\n\nThe key factors are clear: weak starting hand, likely dominated, and facing an opponent who frequently 3-bets and barrels. It's simply not worth the risk to continue with Q4o.",

MiniMax-M2 has shown they'll call raises and play postflop. I should make a standard raise. The minimum raise is to 16 total (which would be 8 more for them to call).\n\nGiven they're short-stacked at 14 BB, I could also consider a larger raise to put pressure on them. A standard raise size would be 3x the big blind = 24 chips total, or about 2.5x = 20 chips.\n\nLet me think about sizing:\n- Minimum raise to 16 (2x BB) - might invite calls from weaker hands\n- Raise to 20 (2.5x BB) - standard\n- Raise to 24 (3x BB) - also standard\n- Larger raise to put pressure on their short stack\n\nSince they're short-stacked and have shown they'll call raises, I should make a solid raise. I'll go with 24 (3x BB) which is a standard preflop raise size. This builds the pot with my premium hand and puts pressure on their short stack.",

A standard raise would be 3x BB = 48 chips, but since I'm on the button with a premium hand against a short stack, I could go slightly bigger to 64 chips (4x BB) to really put pressure on them and potentially take down the pot preflop or set up a post-flop scenario where they have a tough decision with their short stack.\n\nLet me raise to 64 chips which is 4x the big blind - a solid standard raise that puts pressure on the short stack while still giving me flexibility post-flop.",

This is one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - This is the best position, but my hand is too weak to play even in position.\n\n**Stack**: 820 chips (51.2 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Pot**: 24 chips\n**Amount to call**: 8 (to complete the big blind)\n**Minimum raise to**: 32\n\n**Players**: \n- Seat 1 (me): 820 chips\n- Seat 2: 0 chips (folded)\n- Seat 3: 0 chips (folded)\n- Seat 4: 74 chips (BB)\n- Seat 5: 0 chips (folded)\n\nOnly Seat 4 is active with 74 chips in the big blind.\n\nLet me think about this:\n1. **Hand strength**: 2-8 offsuit is extremely weak. It's not connected, not suited, and the cards are low. This hand has very little postflop potential.\n\n2. **Position**: While being on the button is good, it's not enough to justify playing such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 4 has 74 chips (4.6 BB), which is a short stack. They might be desperate and could shove with a wide range. If I call 8 and they shove, I'd have to call 74 more into a pot of 98 (24+74+?).\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, which is 3:1 odds. Even with these odds, 2-8 offsuit is just too weak.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack of 51.2 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands. The goal is to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.\n \nThe optimal play is clearly to fold this terrible hand. Despite the small potential pot, the risk of losing chips with such a weak starting hand far outweighs any potential gain.

That's 3:1 pot odds. With T4 offsuit, even these odds don't justify calling. \n\n**Tournament considerations**: With a 51 BB stack, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my stack and wait for better opportunities.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. T4 offsuit is just too weak, even with good pot odds and position.

          "content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BB (big blind)\n- Cards: 8c 8d (pocket 8s)\n- Stack: 804 chips (50.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 98 chips\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 82 from SB\n- I need to call 66 more\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Seat 4 - MiniMax-M2):**\nLooking at the recall data, I can see MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Hand 53: preflop fold\n- Hand 54: preflop call 85, then flop bet 85\n- Hand 55: preflop fold\n- Hand 56: preflop raise 16 (min-raise)\n- Hand 57: preflop call 16, flop bet 16, call 48, turn bet 48, call 112, river check, call 156\n- Hands 58, 60, 61, 62, 64: various folds\n\nShowdown hands for MiniMax-M2:\n- Hand 57: J8 (Jd 8d) - shows they play suited connectors/gappers\n- Other showdowns show random hands like QJ, 34s, K6, T7s\n\n**My Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket 8s is a strong hand, especially against a single opponent. It's a made hand that doesn't need improvement.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, which is disadvantageous postflop, but I only have one opponent (the SB).\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: MiniMax-M2 seems to be an aggressive player who makes large raises and bets. The raise to 82 from SB is a 5x+ raise (from 16 to 82), which is quite large. This could indicate:\n   - A very strong hand trying to extract value\n   - A bluff/semi-bluff with a weaker hand\n   - A standard aggressive play\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: \n   - Pot is 98, I need to call 66\n   - Pot odds: 98:66 or ~1.48:1\n   - This means I need ~40% equity to call\n\n5. **Stack Considerations**: I have 50 BB, which is a healthy stack. Calling or raising here won't jeopardize my tournament life.\n\n**Decision Time:**\nWith pocket 8s, I have a few options:\n\n**Fold**: Too tight. 88 is a strong hand, especially against one opponent.\n\n**Call**: Reasonable. I can see a flop and evaluate. The pot odds are decent (need ~40% equity). Against a random hand, 88 has about 70% equity. Even against a strong range (TT+, AQ+), 88 has around 40-45% equity.\n\n**Raise**: Also reasonable. I could:\n- Make a small 3-bet to 180-200 to take control\n- Go all-in for 804 to maximize fold equity\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 made a large raise (82), they might have a strong hand, but they could also be bluffing. With pocket 8s, I want to:\n1. Get value from weaker hands\n2. Protect against overcards\n3. Avoid difficult decisions on overcard flops\n\nA 3-bet to around 200-220 would be a good middle ground. It builds the pot with my strong hand, gives me initiative, and allows me to fold if they 4-bet shove (which would likely mean they have QQ+ or AK).\n\nLet me calculate a good raise size:\n- Minimum raise is 148\n- A standard 3-bet would be 3x their raise: 82 x 3 = 246\n- Or about 2.5x: 82 x 2.5 = 205\n\nI'll go with a raise to 210, which is a solid 3-bet size that puts pressure on them while not committing my entire stack.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking at the raise size more carefully:\n- They raised from 8 (SB) to 82, which is a 74 chip raise\n- The pot is 98 (16+82)\n- A 3-bet to 210 would be risking 210 to win 98\n\nWith 88, I should be happy to get it in against most opponents, but I need to be careful. Let me think about the stack sizes:\n- If I raise to 210 and they shove, I'd have to call 594 more into a pot of 98+210+594 = 902, getting about 1.5:1 odds\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive tendencies and my strong hand, I think a 3-bet is the right play."

The big blind still has to act after me.\n\nMy hand is weak: J4 offsuit is a very marginal hand. It's not suited, has low connectivity, and generally should be folded from the small blind against a raise. \n\nLooking at the opponent's actions: In hand #1, seat 2 raised to 8 preflop. That suggests they might be somewhat aggressive, but I only have one data point.\n\nThe pot is currently 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 5 chips to continue. That's about 2.5% of my stack. However, I'm out of position for the entire hand (small blind is the worst position postflop), and my hand is weak.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 5 to win 9, which gives me 1.8:1 odds (35.7% equity needed). J4o vs a typical raising range (say top 20% of hands) has about 30-35% equity. So mathematically it's close, but position makes this much worse.\n\nAlso, the big blind still has to act behind me, which could squeeze or call, making the pot multi-way with a weak hand.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, preserving my stack is important. With 98.5 BB, I have plenty of chips to wait for better spots. Folding weak hands from the small blind is standard.\n\nI should fold.

This suggests they're not overly tight and might defend their blind.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has folded preflop in both previous hands when facing action. This suggests they might be tight or cautious.\n\nMy hand 6s 3h is terrible - unsuited, low cards, no straight potential, no high card strength. Even on the button, this is a clear fold in most situations. The only reason to play would be if I thought I could steal the blinds, but with two opponents left and such a weak hand, it's not worth it.\n\nPosition is good (button), but the hand is just too weak. Even if I raise, I'll likely get called by at least one blind, and then I'll be playing a very weak hand out of position postflop against a likely better hand.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win 3 chips (1.5:1), but that's only if both blinds fold, which is unlikely. If I raise, I'd be putting in more chips with a very weak hand.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (98.5 BB), so no need to take unnecessary risks with trash hands. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies and my hand strength, this is an easy fold.

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called. Looking at MiniMax-M2's history: In hand #1 they folded T8o from BB. In hand #2 they called a raise with J4o from SB and bet flop. In hand #3 they called with 63o from BTN and bet flop and turn. In hand #4 they folded Q2o from CO. In hand #5 they folded T8s from UTG.

I need about 15% equity to call. With 5h Jh, against a UTG+1 raise and a call, my equity is likely below 15% against reasonable ranges.\n\nImplied odds: If I hit a good flop (like two pair or better), I could win more chips. But with J5o, I'm mostly looking to hit two pair or trips. Straight potential is limited (need 4 cards). Flush potential is none since offsuit.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (97.5 BB). No need to take marginal spots from bad position.\n\nGiven all this, folding is correct. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors: The raise was small (min-raise to 4, which is 2BB).

MiniMax-M2 is in the small blind (Seat 4), and GPT-OSS-120B is in the big blind (Seat 5). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop, or I can raise to 4 minimum.\n\n**My stack**: 194 chips (97 BB) - healthy stack\n**Opponent stacks**: MiniMax-M2 (188), GPT-OSS-120B (195)\n\n**Hand strength**: KJo is a decent hand on the button. It's not premium but has good playability postflop. Being on the button gives me positional advantage.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from history**:\n- MiniMax-M2: Has raised preflop once (hand 6) from BB with Qs Ks (premium hand). Otherwise seems to play fairly tight. Folded to a raise from SB with 23s.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Has raised preflop once from SB with 23s (hand 7). Otherwise seems cautious.\n\n**My history**: I've folded every hand so far (7 hands). I need to start playing some hands to accumulate chips. Being too tight can be exploited.\n\n**Pot odds**: Pot is 3 chips, I need to call 2. Getting 1.5:1 odds preflop. Decent odds to see a flop with KJo.\n\n**Positional advantage**: Being on the button is huge. I get to act last on every postflop street.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 97 BB, I have plenty of room to maneuver. I should be looking to accumulate chips, not just preserve my stack.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight. KJo on button is definitely playable.\n2. **Call**: Reasonable. See a cheap flop with position.\n3. **Raise**: Also reasonable. Take initiative, potentially win blinds, or define hand.\n\nI think a raise is best here. KJo plays well as a raise from the button. I can put pressure on the blinds who likely have weak hands. A standard raise to 6-8 chips (3-4x) would be appropriate.\n\nLet me check what a typical raise size would be. Minimum raise is to 4 (2x BB). I should raise more like 6-8 to give myself better fold equity.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips (3x BB). This is a standard button raise."

MiniMax-M2 is in the small blind (Seat 4), and GPT-OSS-120B is in the big blind (Seat 5). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop, or I can raise to 4 minimum.\n\n**My stack**: 194 chips (97 BB) - healthy stack\n**Opponent stacks**: MiniMax-M2 (188), GPT-OSS-120B (195)\n\n**Hand strength**: KJo is a decent hand on the button. It's not premium but has good playability postflop. Being on the button gives me positional advantage.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from history**:\n- MiniMax-M2: Has raised preflop once (hand 6) from BB with Qs Ks (premium hand). Otherwise seems to play fairly tight. Folded to a raise from SB with 23s.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Has raised preflop once from SB with 23s (hand 7). Otherwise seems cautious.\n\n**My history**: I've folded every hand so far (7 hands). I need to start playing some hands to accumulate chips. Being too tight can be exploited.\n\n**Pot odds**: Pot is 3 chips, I need to call 2. Getting 1.5:1 odds preflop. Decent odds to see a flop with KJo.\n\n**Positional advantage**: Being on the button is huge. I get to act last on every postflop street.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 97 BB, I have plenty of room to maneuver. I should be looking to accumulate chips, not just preserve my stack.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight. KJo on button is definitely playable.\n2. **Call**: Reasonable. See a cheap flop with position.\n3. **Raise**: Also reasonable. Take initiative, potentially win blinds, or define hand.\n\nI think a raise is best here. KJo plays well as a raise from the button. I can put pressure on the blinds who likely have weak hands. A standard raise to 6-8 chips (3-4x) would be appropriate.\n\nLet me check what a typical raise size would be. Minimum raise is to 4 (2x BB). I should raise more like 6-8 to give myself better fold equity.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips (3x BB). This is a standard button raise.",

Need to start accumulating chips. Stack is 194 (97 BB) - healthy.\n\nRaise is good to take initiative. Standard raise size is 3-4x BB, so 6-8 chips. Minimum raise is 4 (2x BB). I'll raise to 6 (3x BB).\n\nSo action: raise, raise_to: 6.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider the blinds. MiniMax-M2 in SB, GPT-OSS-120B in BB. They might defend with wide ranges. But position helps.\n\nActually, let me check if I should consider calling instead. Calling 2 with position is fine too. But raising gives me fold equity and initiative.\n\nI'll raise to 6.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze the current situation. I have KJo (Jh Kd) in UTG position with 98.5 BB stack. This is a marginal hand in early position. Looking at the history:\n\n1. In hand #8, I had KJo on the button and raised to 6 (3x) and won the blinds. That was in late position though.\n2. From the opponent observations, Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raised preflop in hand #1 from BB position (raised to 8, 4x BB). Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1) raised preflop in hand #5 from UTG (raised to 6, 3x BB). So both Kimi players are capable of raising.\n\nMy position is UTG, which is the worst position to play from. KJo offsuit is not a strong hand - it's generally folded from early positions in tournament poker. With 5 players left to act behind me, I could easily face raises.\n\nHowever, the blinds are small (1/2) relative to stacks, so there's some room to see a flop cheaply. But if I just call, I risk being raised by later positions.\n\nLooking at stack sizes: everyone has similar stacks around 190-226 chips (95-113 BB). No one is short-stacked.\n\nStandard tournament strategy: Fold KJo from UTG. It's a hand that can get you into trouble - dominated by AK, AQ, KQ, and even KJ suited. When you hit a pair, you're often behind better kings or jacks.\n\nGiven my history of mostly folding (8 folds out of 9 hands), I need to be selective. I won one hand with KJo on the button, but that's different from UTG.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. Let me consider alternatives:\n- Call: Risk being raised, out of position with a marginal hand\n- Raise: With KJo UTG, I'd be raising into 4 players, likely only getting called by better hands\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger spot. I have a healthy stack (98.5 BB), no need to play marginal hands from early position.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

MiniMax-M2 has shown tight tendencies (7 folds in 10 hands). Pot odds of 28.6% require ~29% equity, which Tc 4h likely doesn't have. Better to preserve stack and wait for better spots with positional advantage.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I have a good picture of the situation:\n\n1. My hand: Tc 4h - This is a very weak hand, especially offsuit with no connectivity. Ten-high with a weak kicker.\n\n2. Position: I'm on the BTN (button), which is a great position, but the hand is terrible.\n\n3. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) raised to 4 chips. Looking at their history, they've raised once before (hand #6) with Qs Ks, which is a premium hand. They've mostly been folding preflop (7 folds out of 10 hands), calling twice, and raising once. They seem relatively tight.\n\n4. My stack: 195 chips (97.5 BB) - healthy stack.\n5. Pot: Currently 7 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 4 raise)\n6. Amount to call: 2 chips (since I already posted BB of 2)\n7. Pot odds: I need to call 2 to win 7, so pot odds are 2:7 or 28.6%. My hand needs ~29% equity to justify a call.\n\n8. Tournament considerations: I have a decent stack, no need to take unnecessary risks with such a weak hand.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Tc 4h has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a wide range, it's likely below 30% equity.\n- Being on the button gives me positional advantage postflop, but with such a weak hand, I'll often miss the flop and have to fold.\n- MiniMax-M2 has shown to be tight (7 folds, 2 calls, 1 raise in 10 hands). Their raise likely indicates a decent hand.\n- The raise size is small (min-raise to 4, which is 2BB total), which could indicate either weakness or trapping with a strong hand.\n\nGiven that I need ~29% equity and Tc 4h likely has less than that against a tight opponent's raising range, this is an easy fold. Even if I call, I'll be out of position postflop (actually wait, I'm on the button, so I'll have position on the raiser who is in the SB? Let me check: Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, who is in the SB position? Actually looking at the players: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded, I'm Seat 3 (BTN), Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, Seat 5 folded. So MiniMax-M2 is in the CO position? Wait, the positions: Seat 1 is UTG, Seat 2 is SB, I'm Seat 3 (BTN), Seat 4 is BB, Seat 5 is UTG? Actually with 5 players: Seat 1 would be UTG, Seat 2 SB, Seat 3 BB, Seat 4 BTN, Seat 5 CO? But the hand says: \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\" and \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2\" raised. So MiniMax-M2 is in the CO position (cutoff) and raised, and I'm on the BTN. So I would have position on them postflop.\n\nEven with position, the hand is too weak. Better to fold and wait for a better spot. My tournament stack is healthy, no need to defend with such trash.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

My stack is 194 chips (97 BB). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 8 (4 BB) from early position, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Seat 1 has been folding preflop in recent hands but previously showed down 9d8d and 9s8c - seems to play speculative hands. Seat 2 has been folding preflop in all recent hands but now called a raise.\n\nMy hand Kh9c is marginal, especially from the small blind. King-high with 9 kicker offsuit. Against a raise and a call, I'm likely behind. The pot odds: I need to call 7 to win 19+7=26, so about 3.7:1 odds (27% equity needed).\n\nHowever, I'm out of position (SB) for the entire hand, which is a big disadvantage. With Kh9c, I have some high card potential but the 9 kicker is weak. Against a raiser and caller, I could be dominated by better kings or pairs.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy 97 BB stack. No need to take marginal spots out of position. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of raising to isolate or squeeze, but with Kh9c and out of position, that's risky. The minimum raise would be to 14 total (6 more than the call). But my hand isn't strong enough for that.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Qd Ah (Ace-Queen offsuit). This is a strong hand, especially from the button position. AQo is a premium hand that plays well postflop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position at the table. I get to act last on every postflop street, giving me a significant advantage.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 194 chips (97 BB), which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2, so we're playing deep stacked poker.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression - raised in hand #6 and #11, but folded many other times. Showed Qs Ks in hand #6.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised big in hand #10 (12 chips), but also folded often. Showed As 5h in hand #9.\n\n5. **Action**: Everyone folded to me on the button. I'm facing just the blinds (SB and BB). The amount to call is 2 chips (the BB). I can fold, call, or raise.\n\n6. **Strategic considerations**:\n   - With AQo on the button against only the blinds, this is a clear raise situation.\n   - Raising puts pressure on the blinds and allows me to take the pot preflop often.\n   - Even if called, I have position and a strong hand.\n   - Standard raise size would be 3-4x the BB (6-8 chips) or potentially larger given deep stacks.\n\n7. **My history**: I've been fairly tight (only 1 win in 12 hands, mostly folding). A raise here with AQo would be appropriate and show some aggression.\n\nGiven that the minimum raise is to 4 chips (total), I should raise to around 6-8 chips. Let's go with 6 chips (3x BB), which is a standard raise size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 6,\n  \"reasoning\": \"AQo on button vs blinds is a strong raising hand.

The board is paired with 2s, which reduces the likelihood opponent has trips (though possible).\n\n2. **Opponent Analysis:** From the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has only checked or called on flops in previous hands. This is their first flop bet we've seen. They called my preflop raise from the BB, so their range could be wide: pocket pairs, suited connectors, Broadway cards, etc. The small bet of 8 into 21 (about 38% pot) could be a probe bet with a weak hand, a value bet with a medium pair, or a draw.\n\n3. **Pot Odds:** I need to call 8 to win 29 (21+8). That's about 3.6:1 pot odds, or 27.6% equity needed. Against a range of hands that might bet this flop (pairs, draws, some bluffs), AQ likely has around 30-40% equity. So pot odds are favorable.\n\n4. **Position:** I have position advantage (button) which is valuable. I can see what opponent does on turn before acting.\n\n5. **Stack Sizes:** Both stacks are deep (94 BB effective). This allows for post-flop play.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I have a healthy stack. Being aggressive with position and a decent hand makes sense.\n\n**Decision:** I should call. Reasons:\n- Good pot odds (27.6% equity needed, AQ likely has more)\n- Position advantage\n- Opponent's first flop bet could be weak\n- Overcards have decent equity against many hands\n- If I hit an Ace or Queen on turn, I can win a big pot\n- If I miss, I can reevaluate on turn\n\nA raise could also be considered to take initiative, but with a paired board and opponent's first aggression, calling seems more prudent to keep the pot controlled and use position."

Reasons:\n- Good pot odds (27.6% equity needed, AQ likely has more)\n- Position advantage\n- Opponent's first flop bet could be weak\n- Overcards have decent equity against many hands\n- If I hit an Ace or Queen on turn, I can win a big pot\n- If I miss, I can reevaluate on turn\n\nA raise could also be considered to take initiative, but with a paired board and opponent's first aggression, calling seems more prudent to keep the pot controlled and use position.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm on the button with Qd Ah (Ace-Queen offsuit). The board is 2d 2c Tc 4s (paired deuces, ten, four). The pot is 29 chips. The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) in seat 5 checked to me on the turn. I have 180 chips (90 BB), opponent has 182 chips.\n\nI raised preflop to 6 (3x BB), opponent called. On the flop (2d 2c Tc), opponent bet 8 into a pot of ~13, I called. Now turn is 4s, opponent checks.\n\nMy hand: AQ offsuit. I have Ace high with a Queen kicker. Board is 2d 2c Tc 4s. I have no pair, no draw. Best I have is Ace high with backdoor straight possibilities (needs K and J for Broadway, or 5 and 3 for wheel). Actually, with Q-A, I need specifically K-J for straight, or 5-3 for wheel. Not great.\n\nOpponent's range: They called my preflop raise from BB. Could have a wide range: any pocket pair, suited connectors, broadway cards, etc. On flop they bet 8 into ~13. Could be betting a ten, a pocket pair above ten, a flush draw (though only one club on board), or a bluff. Now they check turn.\n\nGiven they checked turn, they might be giving up with a weak hand, or they might have a medium strength hand and want to check-call. Could also be trapping with a monster like 2x or TT.\n\nI should consider betting for value/protection. With Ace high, I could try to take it down now. But I need to think about opponent's tendencies. From the data, GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop twice (hand 7 and 10), folded preflop 4 times, called once. Not enough data on post-flop play. Only one hand went to showdown (hand 9) where they checked all streets.\n\nPot is 29, I could bet maybe 15-20 to apply pressure. If opponent calls, I'm likely behind. But if they fold, I win the pot. My stack is 180, betting 20 is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, I could check back and try to improve on river. But with Ace high, improving is unlikely unless I hit an Ace or Queen (6 outs). Actually, 3 Aces + 3 Queens = 6 outs. That's about 12% chance to hit on river. Not great.\n\nI think a moderate bet is best. If opponent raises, I can fold. If they call, I need to re-evaluate on river.\n\nLet me check if there are any flush draws: board has 2d 2c Tc 4s. Only one club, so no flush draw. Straight draws possible: someone could have 53 for open-ended, or A3 for gutshot, or J9 for open-ended. But with my AQ, I block some of those.\n\nI'll bet about 18 chips (half pot to 2/3 pot).

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm in UTG position with A6 offsuit. My stack is 209 chips (104.5 BB). The blinds are 1/2. I need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been playing fairly tight - I folded KJ from UTG in hand #10, and folded 8T suited from UTG in hand #5. Now I have A6 offsuit, which is a marginal hand from UTG.\n\nFrom the opponent observations:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB) has shown some aggression - raised to 6 from UTG in hand #5, raised to 8 from SB in hand #12, and called raises. They have 291 chips.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has raised from BB with QsKs in hand #6, and folded to raises.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB) has raised preflop in hand #7 and hand #10.\n\nMy position is UTG, which is the worst position at the table. With A6 offsuit, this is a weak hand to open with. Ace-rag offsuit is generally a fold from UTG in most poker strategies because:\n1. It's dominated by better aces (AJ+, AQ, AK)\n2. It plays poorly postflop\n3. We're out of position against the entire table\n4. We have 3 players left to act behind us\n\nLooking at stack sizes, I have 104.5 BB, which is healthy. I don't need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands.\n\nThe pot odds: need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so getting 1.5:1 odds. But implied odds are poor because we're out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: I want to preserve my stack and wait for better spots. I've won 2 hands already (hand #8 with KJo from BTN, hand #13 with AQo from BTN), so I can afford to be patient.\n\nGiven all this, the correct play is to fold A6o from UTG. It's too weak to open, and calling just invites trouble from players behind.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific opponent tendencies that might change this decision. Looking at the search results, players have been fairly active, so opening with A6o could easily get raised behind me.\n\nI should fold.",

Ace-rag offsuit is generally a fold from early position in tournament poker, especially with 104.5 BB deep stacks.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression with raises from various positions (raised to 6 in hand 5, raised to 8 in hand 12), but also folds frequently.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Mostly folds preflop, called once when facing an 8-chip raise.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Mixed actions - raised once, called once, folded other times.\n\nI have 209 chips (104.5 BB), which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2, so 2 chips to call is just 1 BB.\n\nHowever, being UTG with A6o is problematic:\n1. We're first to act with a marginal hand\n2. Many players left to act behind us (5 players total)\n3. A6o doesn't play well multi-way\n4. We could easily be dominated by better aces (AJ+, AQ, AK)\n5. Even if we hit an ace, we have weak kicker problems\n\nMy hand history shows I've folded both times I was UTG before (with 8\u2666T\u2666 and J\u2665K\u2666). KJo is actually a stronger UTG hand than A6o, and I folded that.\n\nPot odds: 2 chips to call into 3 chip pot (1.5:1), but we need to consider implied odds and reverse implied odds.\n\nTournament considerations: With 104.5 BB, I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots. Playing marginal hands from early position can lead to difficult postflop decisions and stack erosion.\n\nGiven all this, the correct play is to fold. We wait for a better hand in better position.",

Could get re-raised by Seat 1 who already called.\n\n**Decision:** This is an easy fold. Jh 3s is not playable from SB facing a raise and re-raise with a caller.

No need to gamble with marginal hands.\n\nTournament stage: Still early with deep stacks. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nThe opponent's raise size is small (3x BB), which could indicate a wider range, but K9o still doesn't play well postflop out of position.\n\nGiven all factors: fold is the best play.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm on the Button with A3 offsuit. My stack is 206 chips (103 BB). The blinds are 1/2. The SB (MiniMax-M2, 317 chips) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B, 42 chips) are yet to act after me. UTG and UTG+1 have folded.\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has shown some aggression with raises preflop in hand #16, but also folded in several hands. Has a healthy stack.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has only 42 chips (21 BB) and has shown some aggression with raises preflop in hand #16, but also folded recently.\n\nMy hand A3o is marginal. On the button, I have position advantage. With two players left to act, I need to consider:\n1. The BB is short-stacked (42 chips) and might be looking to defend or shove with a wide range.\n2. The SB has a big stack and could 3-bet.\n\nLooking at my own history: I've been playing tight, winning only 2 of 17 hands, mostly folding.\n\nGiven the situation:\n- Calling 2 chips to see a flop is cheap (1% of my stack).\n- Raising could isolate the short-stacked BB or get 3-bet by the SB.\n- Folding is too tight given my position and the cheap price.\n\nWith A3o, I have an ace which is good, but the 3 is weak. However, being on the button gives me good post-flop control. The BB is short-stacked and might shove any decent hand, which could put me in a tough spot if I just call.\n\nI think a small raise to 4-6 chips could be good to:\n1. Isolate the short-stacked BB\n2. Potentially get the SB to fold\n3. Take control of the hand\n\nBut actually, looking at the stack sizes: BB has only 42 chips total. If I raise and BB shoves, I'd have to call off a significant portion of my stack with A3o. That's not ideal.\n\nMaybe a call is better to see a flop cheaply and play position. If the BB shoves, I can reevaluate.\n\nActually, let me think about tournament considerations. I have 103 BB, which is healthy. The BB is short (21 BB). I should be looking to accumulate chips when possible.\n\nGiven the button position and cheap price, I'll call and see a flop. If the BB shoves, I can fold unless I get a great price. If the SB raises, I can fold A3o easily.\n\nWait, looking at the legal actions: I can raise to minimum 4. That's just 2 more chips than calling. A min-raise might be okay to apply pressure.\n\nBut actually, with the BB so short, a min-raise might just invite a shove from the BB with a wide range, putting me in a tough spot.\n\nI think calling is the most balanced approach.

This is a weak hand - I have ace-high with a weak kicker. The board is paired with Kings, which reduces the chance my ace is good. I have no draws - no flush draw, no straight draw. Best case scenario is that opponent has nothing and I can win with ace-high.\n\n2. **Opponent analysis:** GPT-OSS-120B has only 42 chips (21 BB). Looking at their recent actions, in hand #16 they were quite aggressive with raises preflop and on the turn. They seem willing to play aggressively when they have a hand. Their check here could mean weakness, but with such a short stack, they might be looking for a spot to go all-in.\n\n3. **Stack sizes:** I have a huge stack advantage (204 vs 42). The opponent is in a desperate situation and will likely look to double up soon. My stack is healthy at 102 BB.\n\n4. **Position:** I'm on the button, which is excellent. I can control the action and see what opponent does on later streets.\n\n5. **Pot odds:** Currently facing no bet, so pot odds aren't relevant for this decision.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** With opponent so short, I should be careful about giving them a chance to double up. However, I also want to accumulate chips when I have position and can apply pressure.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check here. Reasons:\n- My hand is very weak - ace-high on a paired board\n- If I bet and get raised (especially all-in from the short stack), I'll likely have to fold\n- Checking allows me to see a free turn card\n- I have position, so I can reassess on the turn\n- The pot is small (5 chips), not worth risking chips with such a weak hand\n- If opponent is weak, they might check again on the turn, giving me another free card\n- If opponent bets on the turn, I can easily fold\n\nBetting would be risky because the short stack might shove with any piece of the board (any K, J, or even pocket pair), and I'd have to fold. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to potentially improve or bluff later streets if opponent shows weakness.\n\n**Action:** Check.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 3d As (Ace-three suited in diamonds)\n- Board: Kd Jc Kh 2d\n- Pot: 5 chips\n- My stack: 204 chips (102 BB)\n- Opponent (Seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B): 42 chips (21 BB)\n- Position: I'm on the Button, opponent is in BB\n- Turn just dealt: 2d\n- Opponent checked to me\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have Ace-high with a backdoor flush draw (diamonds). The board shows Kd Jc Kh 2d. There are two kings on board, making it very likely someone has trips or better. I have no pair, just Ace-high with a flush draw.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the data, GPT-OSS-120B has 42 chips (very short stack). They've shown some aggressive tendencies (hand #16 they 3-bet preflop with Jh 3s). They've also folded to river bets (hand #15). They're likely playing tight due to short stack.\n\n**My hand equity:**\n- I need one more diamond for a flush (9 outs)\n- Ace might be good if opponent has nothing\n- But with two kings on board, many hands beat me\n\n**Pot odds and stack considerations:**\nPot is only 5 chips. Opponent has 42 chips total. If I bet and they call or raise, I could be putting chips at risk with a weak hand.\n\n**Tournament situation:**\nI have a healthy stack (204 chips, 102 BB). Opponent is very short (42 chips, 21 BB). I should be careful not to give away chips unnecessarily.\n\n**Decision:**\nSince opponent checked and pot is small, I should probably check behind. Betting here would be risky:\n1. If opponent has a king, they'll call or raise\n2. If they don't have a king, they'll likely fold anyway\n3. My hand has some showdown value (Ace-high) that might be best if checked down\n\nChecking allows me to see a free river and potentially improve to a flush. If I improve on river, I can value bet. If not, I can check and potentially win at showdown if opponent has nothing.\n\n**Better to check and preserve chips.**",

Most hands that called preflop would have at least a pair or draw. However, opponent is short-stacked and might have missed completely.\n2. **Pot size**: Only 5 chips - small pot\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Has shown willingness to fold postflop when weak (folded on river in hand 15)\n4. **Stack preservation**: With my healthy stack vs opponent's short stack, risking chips to win small pot might not be optimal\n5. **Value bet potential**: If I bet, opponent might fold worse hands (any undercards, missed draws). But opponent might call with any pair or better.\n\nGiven the paired board with Kings, my Ace-high is vulnerable. Many hands that called preflop would have something: any pocket pair, any King, any Jack, any Ten, any draw. The board is Kd Jc Kh 2d Th - straight draws missed (only Q9 would have straight, but unlikely).\n\nI think checking is best here. Reasons:\n1. Small pot not worth risking chips\n2. Paired board reduces value of Ace-high\n3. Opponent might call with any pair\n4. If I bet and get raised (though unlikely given opponent's stack), I'd have to fold\n5. Tournament considerations: Preserve chips for better spots\n\nBetter to check and see what opponent has, learn about their tendencies.",

UTG is the worst position to play from, as I'll have to act first on all future streets. The hand has very little potential - no straight or flush possibilities, low cards that rarely make strong pairs.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is the short stack with 41 chips (20.5 BB)\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is in BB with 296 chips\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is next to act after me with 317 chips\n\nFrom the opponent data I can see:\n- GPT-OSS-120B tends to check a lot (from hand 18)\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has folded preflop in recent hands\n- MiniMax-M2 has also folded preflop\n\nMy stack is 209 chips (104.5 BB), which is healthy but not huge. Playing J2o from UTG is generally a losing proposition. Even if I call 2 chips, I'll be out of position with a weak hand, likely facing action from players behind me.\n\nTournament considerations: With a short stack at the table (41 chips), there might be opportunities to pick up pots, but not with this hand from this position. Better to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nPot odds: 2 chips to call into 3 chip pot (1.5:1), but implied odds are terrible with such a weak hand.\n\nConclusion: This is an easy fold. I should wait for a better hand in better position."

UTG is the worst position to play from, as I'll have to act first on all future streets. The hand has very little potential - no straight or flush possibilities, low cards that rarely make strong pairs.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is the short stack with 41 chips (20.5 BB)\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is in BB with 296 chips\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is next to act after me with 317 chips\n\nFrom the opponent data I can see:\n- GPT-OSS-120B tends to check a lot (from hand 18)\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has folded preflop in recent hands\n- MiniMax-M2 has also folded preflop\n\nMy stack is 209 chips (104.5 BB), which is healthy but not huge. Playing J2o from UTG is generally a losing proposition. Even if I call 2 chips, I'll be out of position with a weak hand, likely facing action from players behind me.\n\nTournament considerations: With a short stack at the table (41 chips), there might be opportunities to pick up pots, but not with this hand from this position. Better to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nPot odds: 2 chips to call into 3 chip pot (1.5:1), but implied odds are terrible with such a weak hand.\n\nConclusion: This is an easy fold. I should wait for a better hand in better position.",

It's a garbage hand that has almost no potential to make a strong hand postflop. Even if I hit a pair, it's a weak pair with poor kicker. The hand is not suited, not connected, and very low.\n\nIn tournament poker, preserving chips is important, and playing this hand from UTG would be a major mistake. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nLet me check if there are any tournament considerations: I have 104.5 BB, which is a healthy stack, so I don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n\nThe pot odds: I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds, but with such a terrible hand, the implied odds are terrible too.\n\nI should fold.

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with Jh8h. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 12 (3x BB) from UTG, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called from SB. I need to call 8 chips into a pot of 28 chips (my 4 BB already in plus 12 from UTG plus 12 from SB). That's pot odds of 8 to 28, or 1:3.5, meaning I need about 22% equity to call.\n\nMy hand: Jh8h suited. This is a speculative hand that needs help postflop. Against an UTG raise and a SB call, my equity is likely marginal. From the opponent data:\n\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has shown some aggression (bet on flop and river in hand 20), but I don't see preflop raises in the limited data. Called twice from SB in previous hands.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has raised preflop twice (hands 17 and 20) from what appears to be SB/BB positions. Called a raise here.\n\nMy position is worst (BB) and I'll be out of position postflop against both players. My stack is 205 chips (51 BB), which is healthy but not huge.\n\nThe pot is 28, I need to call 8. If I call, pot becomes 36. Implied odds: if I hit a flush draw or straight draw, I could potentially win more. But being out of position makes it harder to realize equity.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack but not dominant. Folding preserves my stack. Calling with a marginal hand out of position could lead to difficult decisions postflop.\n\nGiven the UTG raise (usually indicates strength) and a caller, plus my poor position, I should probably fold. Jh8h suited isn't strong enough to defend against an UTG raise multi-way.\n\nHowever, let me check if there are any patterns: Seat 1 hasn't shown preflop raises in my limited data, but that could mean this is a stronger range. Seat 2 called, which could mean medium strength.\n\nActually, wait: I should consider that I'm getting 3.5:1 odds. With suited connectors, I need about 20-25% equity. Against a reasonable UTG range and a caller, Jh8s probably has around 25-30% equity. But being out of position reduces my ability to realize that equity.\n\nI think folding is correct here. Better to wait for a better spot with position.\n\nBut let me think about raising: I could raise to isolate or take down the pot now. Minimum raise to 20. That would be 16 more chips (20 total). Pot would be 44 (28 + 16). But I'd be risking 20 chips with a marginal hand against two players who have shown some interest. If I get called or re-raised, I'm in trouble.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: Seat 2 has only 148 chips (37 BB) after posting SB and calling. Seat 1 has 256 chips (64 BB). My 205 is in between.\n\nGiven all factors, I think folding is the most prudent. I'll preserve my stack for better opportunities."

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with Jh8h. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 12 (3x BB) from UTG, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called from SB. I need to call 8 chips into a pot of 28 chips (my 4 BB already in plus 12 from UTG plus 12 from SB). That's pot odds of 8 to 28, or 1:3.5, meaning I need about 22% equity to call.\n\nMy hand: Jh8h suited. This is a speculative hand that needs help postflop. Against an UTG raise and a SB call, my equity is likely marginal. From the opponent data:\n\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has shown some aggression (bet on flop and river in hand 20), but I don't see preflop raises in the limited data. Called twice from SB in previous hands.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has raised preflop twice (hands 17 and 20) from what appears to be SB/BB positions. Called a raise here.\n\nMy position is worst (BB) and I'll be out of position postflop against both players. My stack is 205 chips (51 BB), which is healthy but not huge.\n\nThe pot is 28, I need to call 8. If I call, pot becomes 36. Implied odds: if I hit a flush draw or straight draw, I could potentially win more. But being out of position makes it harder to realize equity.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack but not dominant. Folding preserves my stack. Calling with a marginal hand out of position could lead to difficult decisions postflop.\n\nGiven the UTG raise (usually indicates strength) and a caller, plus my poor position, I should probably fold. Jh8h suited isn't strong enough to defend against an UTG raise multi-way.\n\nHowever, let me check if there are any patterns: Seat 1 hasn't shown preflop raises in my limited data, but that could mean this is a stronger range. Seat 2 called, which could mean medium strength.\n\nActually, wait: I should consider that I'm getting 3.5:1 odds. With suited connectors, I need about 20-25% equity. Against a reasonable UTG range and a caller, Jh8s probably has around 25-30% equity. But being out of position reduces my ability to realize that equity.\n\nI think folding is correct here. Better to wait for a better spot with position.\n\nBut let me think about raising: I could raise to isolate or take down the pot now. Minimum raise to 20. That would be 16 more chips (20 total). Pot would be 44 (28 + 16). But I'd be risking 20 chips with a marginal hand against two players who have shown some interest. If I get called or re-raised, I'm in trouble.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: Seat 2 has only 148 chips (37 BB) after posting SB and calling. Seat 1 has 256 chips (64 BB). My 205 is in between.\n\nGiven all factors, I think folding is the most prudent. I'll preserve my stack for better opportunities.",

Better to preserve stack for better spots with position. Fold and wait for stronger hand.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I have more information. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop before - to 6 in hand 5 and 8 in hand 12. Their showdown hands were 98s and 98o - medium suited connectors. So their raising range might include speculative hands. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop multiple times, including with AKs in hand 20. They called here from SB.\n\nGiven Seat 1's raising range might include hands like 98s, my Jh8h is actually similar but slightly better (higher cards, suited). I'm getting 3.5:1 odds. Against two players, Jh8s has decent equity if we hit a flush or straight. But being out of position is a big disadvantage.\n\nHowever, the pot odds are good. If I call 8 into 28, that's 22% equity needed. Against two opponents with reasonable ranges, Jh8s probably has 25-30% equity. The problem is realizing that equity out of position.\n\nI could consider raising to 20 to try to take it down now. But Seat 1 has 256 chips and might call or re-raise. Seat 2 has 148 and might fold or call.\n\nActually, looking at Seat 1's previous raises: 6 and 8. Here they raised to 12 (3x). That's larger than before. Could indicate strength. Seat 2 called, which might indicate medium strength.\n\nI think folding is still reasonable. But let me check if there are any other factors. My stack is 205, blinds are 2/4. I have plenty of chips. No need to gamble with marginal hand out of position.\n\nI'll fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand:\n\nI'm in the SB with 5s 9d, which is a weak hand - 9 high, offsuit, no straight potential. The pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 12). Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 total (8 more than BB). I need to call 10 chips to continue.\n\nFrom opponent data, Seat 2 has been raising frequently preflop (4 times in 20 hands), with raises ranging from 6-8 chips. In hand #20, they showed Ks As when they raised, so they can have strong hands. But they're also raising frequently, which suggests they might be aggressive.\n\nMy stack is 203 chips (50.8 BB), which is healthy. Seat 2 has 164 chips. The BB (Seat 4) has 318 chips and hasn't acted yet - they could still call or raise.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 10 to win 18, so about 1.8:1 odds (35.7% equity needed). 5-9o has very low equity against a raising range. Even against a wide range, it's probably around 25-30% at best.\n\nPosition is terrible - I'll be out of position postflop against the raiser.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack, no need to gamble with weak hands. Folding costs me only my 2 chip SB already invested.\n\nLooking at my history from SB: I've folded all 4 times when facing action. This seems correct given typical SB play with weak hands.\n\nThe hand is 5-9 offsuit - one of the worst starting hands. Even with good pot odds, being out of position with such a weak hand makes this a clear fold.\n\nI should fold and preserve my stack for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the Button with Jc9c. This is a suited connector, which has decent potential for multi-way pots. The pot is 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4). Both players ahead of me (Seat 1 and 2) have folded. Now it's just me against the SB (Seat 4) and BB (Seat 5).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression. In hand #19, they raised preflop from SB. In hand #22, they called a raise from SB. They also bet on flops when they have initiative.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been very passive, often checking or folding. They have a very short stack of only 37 chips (9.25 BB).\n\nMy position is excellent - I'm on the Button. With J9 suited, I have good implied odds if I hit a flush or straight. The BB has a very short stack, so they might be forced to go all-in with any decent hand.\n\nStack sizes:\n- Me: 203 chips (50.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- SB: 292 chips (73 BB) - big stack\n- BB: 37 chips (9.25 BB) - very short\n\nThe BB is so short that they'll likely call with a wide range. The SB might defend with a wide range too.\n\nGiven my position and the hand strength, I should consider raising to isolate the short stack BB or take it down preflop. A small raise to 8 chips (minimum raise) would put pressure on both players.\n\nHowever, J9s is not a premium hand. It's a speculative hand that plays well multi-way or in position. Since both opponents have yet to act, and the BB is very short, I might want to just call and see a flop cheaply, hoping to hit something strong.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. That's decent for a suited connector.\n\nBut with my position, I could also raise to 8 chips. That would be a 2x raise over the BB. This might get folds from the SB and BB, or isolate the short stack.\n\nGiven the tournament context and my stack size, I should play cautiously but take advantage of position. The BB is so short that they might shove any two cards, which would put me in a tough spot if I raise.\n\nActually, looking at the BB's history: they've folded a lot preflop recently (hands 19-22). They might be waiting for a premium hand to shove with their short stack.\n\nI think the best play is to call and see a flop cheaply. If I raise and get re-raised by the SB or shoved on by the BB, I'll have to fold J9s. By calling, I keep the pot small and can play postflop in position.\n\nDecision: Call.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me check opponent tendencies. We're on the button with J9 suited. We have 50.8 BB, which is healthy. The SB (Seat 4) has 292 chips (73 BB) and BB (Seat 5) has only 37 chips (9.25 BB) - very short stacked.\n\nWe're in position with a speculative hand. J9 suited can make strong flushes, straights, and occasional top pair. Being on the button is great for position. The BB is very short, so they might be forced to call with a wide range if we raise.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips, we need to call 4 to see the flop. Minimum raise is to 8 total. Let me think about options:\n\n1. Fold: J9 suited isn't premium, but we're on the button with only blinds left to act. The BB is very short, which changes dynamics.\n\n2. Call: Limping in from the button with a speculative hand is reasonable.\n\n3. Raise: Could raise to take initiative and potentially isolate the short stack.\n\nGiven the BB's stack is only 37 chips (9.25 BB), if we raise to say 12-16, they might be forced to go all-in with a wide range. This creates a good spot to potentially win their stack if they fold or we hit.\n\nBut we need to be careful about the SB who has a big stack. They might defend wide.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: BB has 37 chips. If we raise to 12 (3x), they'd have to call 8 more to win ~18 (pot 6 + our 12). That's about 2.25:1 pot odds, which might force them to call with many hands. If they shove, we'd have to call 25 more to win ~50, getting 2:1 odds.\n\nWith J9 suited, I'm comfortable calling a shove from the BB getting 2:1 odds. The hand has decent equity against many ranges.\n\nI think raising is best here to put pressure on the short stack and take initiative. Let's raise to 12 (3x).",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with Jc9c\n- Board: Js 3c 2h\n- I raised preflop to 12 (3x BB), MiniMax-M2 called from SB\n- Flop: MiniMax-M2 bets 8 into pot of 36\n- Amount to call: 8, pot is 44 after call\n- My stack: 191 chips (47.8 BB)\n- MiniMax-M2 stack: 274 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have top pair with jack and a weak kicker (9). The board is dry with Js 3c 2h - no flush draws, only possible straight draws would be with 54 or A4. This is a favorable flop for my hand.\n\n**Opponent analysis from memory:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's actions:\n- Hand #19: Preflop raise to 4, then bet 2 on flop\n- Hand #22: Called preflop raise of 8, then bet 16 on flop, then folded to a raise\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 tends to continuation bet on flops but might fold to aggression. The bet of 8 into 36 pot is a small bet (22% pot), which could be a probe bet with a weak hand or a draw.\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\nI have position on MiniMax-M2 (BTN vs SB). My stack is 191 vs opponent's 274. Pot odds: 8 to win 44 = 1:5.5 or ~18% equity needed. I have top pair which is likely good here.\n\n**Possible hands for opponent:**\n- Could have called preflop with many hands: small to medium pairs, suited connectors, broadway cards\n- Small bet could mean: weak jack with worse kicker, middle/bottom pair, draw, or complete bluff\n\n**Decision:**\nI should raise here. Reasons:\n1. Top pair on dry board is strong\n2. Opponent's small bet suggests weakness\n3. I have position advantage\n4. Opponent has shown tendency to fold to aggression on flop (Hand #22)\n5. Raising can get value from worse hands and protect against draws\n6. If called, I can evaluate turn action\n\nRaise size: Minimum raise to 16 seems small. I should raise larger - maybe to 24-28 (3-3.5x the bet). Let's do 24 total (12 more). This builds the pot while giving bad odds to draws.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Top pair on dry board with position.

The board is Js 3c 2h Qh 4c. The river brought a 4c, completing a possible flush draw (clubs), but I have Jc 9c - I have a club flush draw that missed (only one club on board, 4c). \n\nMy hand is marginal - just a pair of Jacks. The Q on turn is concerning as it beats me if opponent has Qx. The board is relatively dry - no straights possible (2,3,4, J, Q - gap between 4 and J).\n\nFrom opponent's actions:\n- Preflop: Called my raise from SB (reasonable defense)\n- Flop: Led out small bet (8 into ~28 pot), then called my raise\n- Turn: Checked after Q came (could be scared of Q, or trapping)\n- River: Checked (likely giving up or trapping)\n\nFrom opponent history:\n- Hand #6: Showed Qs Ks (top pair good kicker) when they checked river\n- Hand #16: Showed Kh Kc (overpair) when they checked river  \n- They tend to check strong hands on river sometimes\n\n**Possible opponent hands:**\n- Qx hands (QJ, Q10, Q9, etc.) - would likely bet river for value\n- Weaker Jacks (J10, J9, J8) - might check-call\n- Pocket pairs (33, 22) - sets would likely bet river\n- Missed draws (A10, K10, clubs) - likely checking\n- Bluffs that gave up\n\n**My decision:**\nI should check back. Reasons:\n1. My hand is marginal - just a pair of Jacks with 9 kicker\n2. I have showdown value but likely only beats bluffs\n3. If I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot\n4. Opponent called my flop raise, so likely has at least something\n5. The pot is already decent at 76 chips (19 BB)\n6. Tournament consideration: I have 41.8 BB, decent stack, no need to risk chips with marginal hand\n\nBetter to check and see if my Jacks are good. If opponent was on a draw that missed, I win. If they have a better hand, I lose minimal.\n\nLet me check back.",

Shows 9-8 suited type hands. Has folded the last 2 hands preflop.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown pocket Kings (hand 16) and pocket 6s (hand 23). Has called raises preflop and shown aggression postflop.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has folded preflop in last 5+ hands. Very short stack (35 chips, less than 9 BB).\n\nMy stack is 243 chips (60.8 BB), which is healthy. The pot is 6 chips (SB and BB). I need to call 4 to see the flop.\n\nGiven my position (UTG) and weak hand (K6o), this is an easy fold. Playing K6o from UTG is generally a losing proposition. Even if I call, I'll be out of position against 4 other players (SB, BB, and two more to act). The hand has poor implied odds and reverse implied odds - if I hit a King, I could be dominated by better Kings. The 6 kicker is terrible.\n\nAlso, with a short stack behind (Seat 5 with 35 chips), there could be all-in pressure.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for better spots. I've been folding a lot recently (folded last 4 hands), but that's fine - tournament poker requires patience.

The short stack has only 41 chips (10 BB).\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking: Folded last 3 hands preflop, raised once from SB in hand 21\n   - Kimi-K2: Has raised preflop in hands 20 and 22, showing aggression\n   - MiniMax-M2: Calls preflop and bets post-flop\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a short stack at the table, there might be some ICM pressure, but I have a healthy stack.\n\n6. **Hand analysis**: KJo from UTG is generally a fold in standard poker strategy. It's dominated by AK, AQ, AJ, KQ, and even KJ can be in trouble against these. Being out of position makes it worse.\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm in the worst position\n- Multiple aggressive players behind\n- KJo is a marginal hand that plays poorly out of position\n- Better to wait for stronger spots with my healthy stack\n\nThe correct play is to fold.",

It's suited, but ten-high with a weak kicker. Suited connectors need higher cards to be playable. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n1. MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) raised to 8 (2x BB). From history: has been calling and betting but also folding. Seems somewhat active.\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1) called the raise. From history: has been folding a lot recently (folded last 4 hands), but called here. Might have a decent hand.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 22 chips, I need to call 4 chips. That's about 5.5:1 pot odds. However, position is terrible and hand is weak.\n\n**Stack considerations:** I have 239 chips (59.8 BB), which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots from bad position.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have a decent stack. No reason to get involved with Th 2h from SB when facing a raise and a call. Even if I flop a flush draw, I'll be out of position and could face more betting.\n\n**Better spots:** I should wait for better hands in better positions.\n\nThis is an easy fold. I already put in 2 chips as SB, but calling 4 more with Th 2h from SB is -EV.\n\nLet me check if there's any history of opponents bluffing or being loose that might change my decision. Looking at the opponent actions: both have been relatively tight recently. Kimi-K2 Thinking folded last 4 hands preflop. MiniMax-M2 folded last 2 hands preflop. So they're not overly loose.\n\n**Decision:** Fold.",

With T8o, raising might not be optimal as I don't want to play a big pot with this hand. Better to call and see a flop cheaply.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 59BB, which is healthy. No need to take big risks with marginal hands. But calling 2 chips (0.5BB) with position is fine.\n\nFrom my hand history: I've been folding a lot (22 folds out of 26 hands). I should be playing more hands from button to accumulate chips.\n\nDecision: Call and see flop. Use position to potentially win pot postflop if opponent checks or shows weakness.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"T8o is marginal but with 3:1 pot odds and button position, calling 2 chips (0.5BB) to see flop is reasonable. Raising would commit more chips with weak hand. Use position advantage postflop.\"\n}",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:** #27\n**My Position:** BTN (Seat 3)\n**My Cards:** 8\u2666 T\u2663\n**My Stack:** 235 chips (58.8 BB)\n**Blinds:** 2/4\n**Pot:** 16 chips\n**Action:** I posted SB 2, BB posted 4, everyone folded to me, I called 2 (completing SB), and BB (Seat 4: MiniMax-M2) raised to 12 total (8 more).\n**Amount to call:** 8 chips\n**Minimum raise to:** 20 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** 8\u2666 T\u2663 is a weak hand. It's offsuit, not connected, and has low cards. Preflop, this is a folding hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the button, which is good, but the hand is too weak to justify playing against a raise.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the recall, MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has raised preflop multiple times:\n   - Hand #6: raised 4 (with Qs Ks)\n   - Hand #11: raised 4\n   - Hand #16: raised 4 then 8 (with Kh Kc)\n   - Hand #19: raised 4\n   - Hand #26: raised 8\n   \n   They've shown strong hands (KK) and also speculative hands. Their current raise is 12 total (8 more), which is a standard 3x BB raise.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 16 chips, I need to call 8 chips. That's 2:1 pot odds (33% equity needed). With 8\u2666 T\u2663, I don't have anywhere near 33% equity against a BB raising range.\n\n5. **Stack Sizes:** I have 235 chips (58.8 BB), opponent has 296 chips. Calling 8 chips is only 3.4% of my stack, but this is a tournament and chip preservation is important.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I'm in a good chip position (58.8 BB). No need to gamble with weak hands. Better to wait for better spots.\n\n7. **Alternatives:** I could consider a 3-bet bluff from the button, but with 8\u2666 T\u2663 and against an opponent who has shown willingness to raise with strong hands, this seems risky.\n\n**Conclusion:** Fold. The hand is too weak, pot odds don't justify calling, and position advantage doesn't overcome the hand weakness against a raise.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"8\u2666 T\u2663 is too weak to continue against a BB raise.

Hand strength: Ts5s is very weak, even suited. It's a hand that needs to hit the flop hard to continue.\n2. Position: Being on the button is great, but with such a weak hand, position alone may not justify playing.\n3. Stack sizes: The BB has only 43 chips, so any raise could commit him to go all-in.\n4. Tournament considerations: I have 58.8 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n5. Pot odds: To call 4 into a pot of 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. But the hand is so weak that even these odds aren't great.\n\nBetter options:\n- Fold: Ts5s is a trash hand. Even suited, it's dominated by almost any raising range.\n- Raise: Could try to steal the blinds, but MiniMax-M2 in SB has shown aggression and might defend, and BB is short-stacked and desperate.\n- Call: Would put me in a multi-way pot out of position postflop with a weak hand.\n\nGiven the short-stacked BB (only 43 chips), any action could induce an all-in from him. Ts5s doesn't play well against an all-in range. \n\nDecision: Fold. This hand is too weak to play, even from the button. The risk of the short-stacked BB shoving and the SB potentially defending makes this a clear fold. Preserve my stack for better spots.",

I'm first to act after the blinds. The players behind me include MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) who has been quite aggressive - raising preflop in multiple hands (26, 27, 28). GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) has a very short stack of only 29 chips (7.25 BB).\n\nFrom my opponent recall:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, seat 1) has mostly folded preflop, but did call once and then raised on the flop in hand 26.\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) is aggressive, raising preflop frequently.\n\nWith Q7o from UTG, this is an easy fold. I have position disadvantage, weak hand, and aggressive players behind me who could easily 3-bet. Even if I limp, I'll be out of position with a weak hand against potentially multiple opponents.\n\nMy stack is 235 chips (58.8 BB), which is healthy but not massive. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots. The short stack at seat 5 (29 chips) might be looking to shove soon, so I don't want to get involved with marginal hands.\n\nGiven all this, folding is the clear decision.",

I already posted 4 chips as BB, so I need to call 8 more chips. Pot is currently 18 (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 12). \n\nFrom the opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 actions were folds). They raised once in hand #30 (to 8, which is 2x BB) and then folded when facing action. They called once in hand #26 and then raised on the flop. This suggests they might be somewhat tight but occasionally aggressive.\n\nMy hand Qd 3s is very weak - Q3o is a trash hand. I'm out of position (BB vs UTG raiser). I have 57.8 BB stack, which is healthy. The pot odds: I need to call 8 to win 18, which is about 2.25:1 or 31% equity needed.\n\nQ3o has very little equity against a UTG raising range. Even against a wide range, it's probably around 25-30% equity at best. Against a tight range, it's much worse.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack (231 chips, 57.8 BB). No need to take marginal spots. Being out of position with a weak hand makes this an easy fold.\n\nThe opponent's raise size is 12 (3x BB), which is a standard raise. Their history shows they're fairly tight, so their range is likely stronger.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot. Folding preserves my stack.\n\nLet me check if there are any other relevant factors... The other players folded, so it's heads-up between me and Kimi-K2 Thinking. I'm in the BB, so I've already invested 4 chips, but that's a sunk cost.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand:** Td 6s (Ten of diamonds, 6 of spades) - a weak hand, offsuit, no connectivity\n**Position:** SB (Small Blind) - worst position postflop\n**Stack:** 229 chips (57.2 BB) - healthy stack\n**Pot:** 64 chips already\n**Action:** Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 29, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called\n**Amount to call:** 27 chips (from my 2 chip SB already posted)\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been raising frequently preflop (raises of 8, 41, 12) but also folding a lot. Shows aggressive tendencies. Currently has 0 chips (out) but made this raise before busting.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Mostly folds preflop, but raised to 24 in hand #30 and called this 29 chip raise. Has shown AKs before. Seems somewhat tight but capable of calling raises.\n\nMy hand T6o is very weak. Even with pot odds, I need to consider:\n- Pot is 64 chips, I need to call 27 chips \u2192 pot odds of about 2.37:1 (27 to win 64)\n- Implied odds are poor because I'm out of position and have a weak hand\n- Even if I hit a pair, I could easily be dominated\n- Multiway pot with two opponents already involved\n\nMy stack is healthy at 57BB, so I don't need to take marginal spots. Folding here preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nThe fact that Seat 5 is out (0 chips) suggests this might be an all-in or near all-in situation for them, but they still have chips to play this hand. Actually wait, if they have 0 chips now, they must have gone all-in or busted after this hand. Their raise to 29 was likely a significant portion of their stack.\n\nGiven my terrible position with a weak hand, I should fold. The pot odds might seem tempting, but postflop play will be very difficult out of position with a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision:** Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the button with 9c6c. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (3x BB). I need to call 12 to see a flop. The pot is currently 18 (4 from BB, 2 from SB, plus 12 raise). \n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown some aggression - raised to 24 in hand 30, called 29 in hand 32, and bet on flop in hand 32.\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been mostly folding preflop, but showed some speculative hands like 98s, 98o in showdowns.\n\nMy hand: 9c6c is a suited connector, but not a great one. It's only 96 suited, which is pretty weak. The suited aspect gives some flush potential, but 96 is a long way from the nuts even if I hit a flush.\n\nPosition: I'm on the button, which is great position. However, I still have two players left to act behind me (SB and BB). Actually wait, SB already posted and BB is Seat 1. So there's still BB to act after me.\n\nStack sizes: I have 229 chips (57 BB), which is healthy. Seat 2 has 120 (30 BB), Seat 1 has 202 (50.5 BB).\n\nPot odds: I need to call 12 to win 30 (current pot 18 + my call 12 = 30). That's 2.5:1 odds, or 28.6% equity needed.\n\nHand equity: 96s vs a typical raising range has maybe 30-35% equity, but this is marginal. The problem is I'm out of position relative to the raiser (Seat 2) unless both blinds fold.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack and don't need to take big risks with marginal hands. This is a speculative hand that needs to hit the flop hard to continue.\n\nGiven the information:\n1. Weak suited connector\n2. Facing a raise from early position (Seat 2 is UTG+1 or MP)\n3. Decent pot odds but marginal equity\n4. Position advantage if I call\n5. But risk of re-raise from blinds\n\nI think this is a fold. 96s is too weak to call a raise, even on the button. Better to wait for stronger spots.",

They seem to be opening up their range.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is in the small blind and has shown aggressive tendencies with raises and 3-bets.\n\nMy hand: 9c6c is a suited connector, which plays well in position, but it's a weak hand overall. I'm on the button, which is the best position. However, I need to consider:\n\n1. Hand strength: 96s is weak - needs a good flop to continue\n2. Position: Good (button)\n3. Stack sizes: I have 57BB, opponent has 30BB (Seat 2), SB has 88BB\n4. Pot odds: Need to call 12 to win 30 (18+12), so I need ~29% equity\n5. Implied odds: If I hit a strong draw or hand, I can win more chips\n\nHowever, there are concerns:\n- The small blind (Seat 4) is aggressive and could squeeze/3-bet behind me\n- Even if I call, I'll be out of position against the raiser postflop unless SB folds\n- 96s doesn't play well against a raise range\n\nLooking at the data, Seat 2's raise could be wider since they've been folding a lot and might be opening up. But 96s is just too weak to call a raise, even in position. The suited aspect gives some value, but not enough to justify calling 12 chips (5.2% of my stack).\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot.

The BB is very short-stacked, which could create some interesting dynamics.\n\nMy stack is 229 chips (57.2 BB), which is healthy but not huge. I should be playing relatively tight to preserve my stack.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): they've been raising preflop in some hands (8, 12, 40 chips), so they're somewhat active. But from the SB, they might defend with a wide range.\n\nHowever, Q6s from UTG is just too weak to open. Even if I limp, I'm inviting others to raise behind me, and I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand with a weak hand. The BB is short-stacked (8 chips), so if I raise, I might get all-in against them, but Q6s doesn't do well against a short stack's shoving range.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot.

Q6s is a speculative hand at best - it has some flush potential but is easily dominated by better queens. From UTG, standard poker strategy says to play tight, and Q6s is definitely not in a UTG opening range.\n\nLooking at the table: Seat 1 (SB) has 336 chips, Seat 2 (BB) has only 8 chips (2 BBs), Seat 4 (CO) has 345 chips. The BB is very short-stacked, which could create some interesting dynamics.\n\nMy stack is 229 chips (57.2 BB), which is healthy but not huge. I should be playing relatively tight to preserve my stack.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): they've been raising preflop in some hands (8, 12, 40 chips), so they're somewhat active. But from the SB, they might defend with a wide range.\n\nHowever, Q6s from UTG is just too weak to open. Even if I limp, I'm inviting others to raise behind me, and I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand with a weak hand. The BB is short-stacked (8 chips), so if I raise, I might get all-in against them, but Q6s doesn't do well against a short stack's shoving range.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. Let me check if there are any other considerations.",

Poor hand strength, out of position, and likely dominated by opponent's raising range. With 56.2 BB stack, better to wait for a better spot despite 3:1 pot odds.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Qh 5d is a weak hand, especially offsuit with a 5 kicker. This is not a premium hand by any means.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (big blind) facing a raise from the SB (seat 2). I'll be out of position postflop.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at seat 2's actions:\n   - Hand 30: raised to 24 preflop\n   - Hand 31: folded preflop  \n   - Hand 32: called 29 preflop, then bet 45 on flop and folded\n   - Hand 33: raised to 12, then 3-bet to 120 preflop, checked flop, folded turn\n   - Hand 34: folded preflop\n   \n   This opponent seems somewhat aggressive but not wildly so. They've shown some willingness to raise and 3-bet preflop.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - My stack: 225 chips (56.2 BB)\n   - Opponent (seat 2): Stack size isn't shown but they posted SB 2 and raised 8 total, so they have at least 8 chips\n   - Pot: 12 chips currently (2 SB + 4 BB + 8 raise - but wait, seat 2 already posted SB 2, so they raised 8 more to total 10? Actually: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, SB raises to 8 total, so additional 6? Let me recalculate: SB already had 2 in, raises to 8 total, so additional 6. Pot = 2 (SB) + 4 (BB) + 6 (additional raise) = 12 chips. Amount to call is 4 more (since I already have 4 in as BB).\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 to win 12, so pot odds are 3:1 or 25%. With Q5o, I need to consider if I have at least 25% equity against opponent's range.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 56.2 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands.\n\n7. **My recent history**: I've been folding a lot (win rate 11.8%, folded 30 of 34 hands). Might be playing too tight.\n\nHowever, Q5o is just too weak to defend from the BB against a raise, even with good pot odds. The problem is:\n- Poor hand strength\n- Out of position\n- Weak kicker\n- No connectivity or suitedness\n\nEven with 3:1 pot odds, I'm likely dominated by many hands in opponent's raising range. If they have any Q, they likely have a better kicker. If they have any pair, I'm behind. Only real value is if I hit two pair or trips.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. This is a standard fold with Q5o from BB facing a raise.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q5o is too weak to defend from BB against a raise.

Wait, the player list shows \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\". But the action shows \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 12\". This seems contradictory. Let me check - if Seat 2 is out, they shouldn't be able to raise. Perhaps this is a display issue or they're actually still in? The action says they raised 12, so they must have chips.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n   - Hand 33: Raised to 12 preflop, then re-raised to 120\n   - Hand 35: Raised to 8 preflop\n   - This suggests they're raising with a range of hands, not just premium ones\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise). I need to call 10 to win 18, which gives me 1.8:1 odds or 35.7% pot odds. With 94o, I have nowhere near 35.7% equity against a raising range.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a decent stack relative to blinds (55.8 BB). There's no need to defend with such a weak hand from the worst position. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots.\n\n7. **Additional factors**: The BB (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) still has to act after me. They have 341 chips and could re-raise, putting me in an even worse spot.\n\nThis is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, position is terrible, and pot odds don't justify calling with such poor equity. Let me fold and wait for a better opportunity."

The action says they raised 12, so they must have chips.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n   - Hand 33: Raised to 12 preflop, then re-raised to 120\n   - Hand 35: Raised to 8 preflop\n   - This suggests they're raising with a range of hands, not just premium ones\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise). I need to call 10 to win 18, which gives me 1.8:1 odds or 35.7% pot odds. With 94o, I have nowhere near 35.7% equity against a raising range.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a decent stack relative to blinds (55.8 BB). There's no need to defend with such a weak hand from the worst position. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots.\n\n7. **Additional factors**: The BB (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) still has to act after me. They have 341 chips and could re-raise, putting me in an even worse spot.\n\nThis is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, position is terrible, and pot odds don't justify calling with such poor equity. Let me fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

I'll be out of position for the entire hand. The pot odds of 10 to win 18 (1.8:1) require about 35.7% equity, and 94o doesn't have that against most raising ranges.\n\nAlso, the big blind still has to act behind me with 341 chips, so I could face a re-raise.\n\nGiven my decent stack size (55.8 BB), there's no need to defend with such a weak hand.

I need to make a decision and output that JSON.\n\nI was analyzing the hand: I'm on the button with Ah 4c, 223 chips (55.8 BB). Blinds are 2/4. Action folded to me. I can call 4, raise, or fold. I was leaning toward fold based on my analysis. Let me finalize.\n\nReasons to fold: A4o is weak, both blinds are aggressive and likely to defend/3-bet, I'm out of position postflop relative to blinds, my stack is healthy enough to wait for better spots.\n\nReasons to raise: Position advantage, could steal blinds, but blinds are aggressive so might not work.\n\nReasons to call: Cheap to see flop, but then I'm playing a multiway pot with weak hand out of position.\n\nI think fold is correct. So I should output JSON with action: \"fold\", raise_to: null, and a brief reasoning.\n\nWait, but \"fold\" is an action. Actually, looking at the prompt: \"When you decide on an action, respond with a JSON object in this exact format: { \"action\": \"fold\" | \"check\" | \"call\" | \"raise\", \"raise_to\": <number if raising, otherwise null>, \"reasoning\": \"<brief explanation of your decision>\" }\". So for fold, I set action: \"fold\", raise_to: null.\n\nI need to provide a brief explanation. Something like: \"A4o is too weak to play from button against aggressive blinds. Better to wait for stronger hand with 55.8 BB stack.\"\n\nYes, that works. Let me output the JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current hand:** I'm in BB with K7s. The SB folded after posting, and MiniMax-M2 in MP/CO just limped (called). Now it's my action with 0 to call (since I already posted BB of 4). Pot is 10 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 4 limp).\n\n**My hand:** K7s is a weak hand. King-high with weak kicker, suited but still marginal. In BB defense situations, we can defend wider, but K7o is pretty weak.\n\n**Position:** I'm out of position (BB) against one limper. This is not ideal as I'll have to act first on every street.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 219 chips (54.8 BB), MiniMax has 351 chips. I'm not short-stacked.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** From the recall, MiniMax-M2 seems to limp/call frequently preflop (hands 32, 33, 36). They folded to raises in some spots. They seem to play somewhat passively preflop.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have a decent stack, not desperate. Should preserve chips but also look for opportunities.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. K7s is weak but playable in BB defense\n2. Only one limper, so pot is small\n3. I'm out of position\n4. MiniMax seems passive preflop\n5. If I check, I'll see a flop for free (already invested 4 chips)\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check:** See flop for free, evaluate. Probably best with this weak hand.\n- **Raise:** Could try to steal the pot, but with K7s and out of position against a limper who might call, raising seems spewy.\n- **Fold:** Not possible (check is available).\n\nGiven the situation, checking seems optimal. I get to see a flop for free with a hand that has some potential (suited, could hit top pair with K). If I hit something, I can continue; if not, I can easily fold.\n\nI should check and see the flop.",

The pot is 10 chips, and it's checked to me on the flop. I have 219 chips (54.8 BB). The only opponent left is MiniMax-M2 with 351 chips.\n\nLooking at the opponent data: MiniMax-M2 has been fairly active preflop, raising frequently. On hand #32, they called 25 preflop (which seems like a big blind call), then check-raised on the flop from 90. That suggests they can be aggressive post-flop.\n\nMy hand is weak: King-high with no pair, no draws. The board has an Ace and Jack, which likely hits many of MiniMax-M2's calling range. Given they just called preflop (not raised), they could have a wide range including suited connectors, small pairs, or Ace-rag hands.\n\nWith this board texture (As Jd 5c), my K-high is likely behind. Even if I had a king, I'd be behind any Ace, Jack, or pair. The pot is only 10 chips, so not much to fight for.\n\nGiven my tournament stack of 54.8 BB, I should be cautious with weak hands. I have position advantage (acting last on flop), but with such a weak hand, checking seems best. I could consider a small bluff bet since the board might have missed both players, but with an Ace on board and opponent having called preflop, they likely have something.\n\nBetter to check and see what happens on the turn. If opponent bets, I can easily fold. If opponent checks behind, I get a free card and might improve.\n\nI'll check.",

Opponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has 351 chips. The hand has been very passive so far: preflop SB folded, we checked BB, seat 4 just called. On the flop, both checked.\n\nOur hand is weak: K-high with 7 kicker, no pair, no draw. We have a backdoor straight draw (need 8 and 9 for a straight, but board has A, J, 5, 6 - that's not really a draw). Actually, we have a gutshot straight draw to a T (if a T comes, we'd have K-high straight? Wait: Board: As Jd 5c 6c, we have 7s Kh. We need 8-9-T for a straight? Actually: 5-6-7-8-9 would be a straight, but we have 7 and board has 5,6, so we need 8 and 9. That's a double gutter? Actually 4-8 would also give us 4-5-6-7-8 straight. So we have some straight possibilities but very remote.\n\nThe opponent's range: They limped preflop from UTG+1 (seat 4), then checked flop. They could have a wide range of hands - small pairs, suited connectors, weak aces, etc. Their check on the flop suggests weakness or they're slowplaying.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've shown some aggression (hand 32 they raised on flop with Ad5d on 9c8s7s board). They've shown down decent hands: KK, 66, Ad5d, JQ. They seem to play reasonably.\n\nPot is only 10 chips. We have position (we act first on turn). With such a weak hand, checking seems best. If we bet, we're bluffing with very little equity. If checked to us on river, we might consider a bluff if opponent shows weakness again.\n\nGiven the tiny pot and our weak hand, checking is the standard play. We can see what opponent does on river. If they bet, we'll likely fold. If they check, we might consider a small bluff on river if we think they're weak.\n\nActually, wait: We're in the BB, so we acted first preflop? Actually preflop: SB posted, we posted BB, seat 4 called, SB folded, we checked. So we have position postflop (seat 4 acts after us). On turn, we act first.\n\nChecking seems correct. No need to bluff into such a small pot with a hand that has some showdown value (K-high might be best if opponent has complete air). We can check and evaluate river."

Opponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has 351 chips. The hand has been very passive so far: preflop SB folded, we checked BB, seat 4 just called. On the flop, both checked.\n\nOur hand is weak: K-high with 7 kicker, no pair, no draw. We have a backdoor straight draw (need 8 and 9 for a straight, but board has A, J, 5, 6 - that's not really a draw). Actually, we have a gutshot straight draw to a T (if a T comes, we'd have K-high straight? Wait: Board: As Jd 5c 6c, we have 7s Kh. We need 8-9-T for a straight? Actually: 5-6-7-8-9 would be a straight, but we have 7 and board has 5,6, so we need 8 and 9. That's a double gutter? Actually 4-8 would also give us 4-5-6-7-8 straight. So we have some straight possibilities but very remote.\n\nThe opponent's range: They limped preflop from UTG+1 (seat 4), then checked flop. They could have a wide range of hands - small pairs, suited connectors, weak aces, etc. Their check on the flop suggests weakness or they're slowplaying.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've shown some aggression (hand 32 they raised on flop with Ad5d on 9c8s7s board). They've shown down decent hands: KK, 66, Ad5d, JQ. They seem to play reasonably.\n\nPot is only 10 chips. We have position (we act first on turn). With such a weak hand, checking seems best. If we bet, we're bluffing with very little equity. If checked to us on river, we might consider a bluff if opponent shows weakness again.\n\nGiven the tiny pot and our weak hand, checking is the standard play. We can see what opponent does on river. If they bet, we'll likely fold. If they check, we might consider a small bluff on river if we think they're weak.\n\nActually, wait: We're in the BB, so we acted first preflop? Actually preflop: SB posted, we posted BB, seat 4 called, SB folded, we checked. So we have position postflop (seat 4 acts after us). On turn, we act first.\n\nChecking seems correct. No need to bluff into such a small pot with a hand that has some showdown value (K-high might be best if opponent has complete air). We can check and evaluate river.",

The board is A J 5 6 8. There's no flush possible (two clubs, but not three of same suit). The board has straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9, but I only have 7, so I don't have a straight. My hand is essentially King-high, which is very weak on this board.\n\n**Betting history:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 limped (called), I checked from BB\n- Flop: Both checked\n- Turn: Both checked\n- River: Action is on me, no bet yet\n\n**Opponent analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the data, MiniMax-M2 has shown various betting patterns:\n- Sometimes aggressive with bets on flop/turn\n- Has raised preflop several times\n- Has called and limped in various spots\n- Has checked rivers before (Hand #23)\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 10 chips, I can check for free or bet. If I bet, I risk chips to win 10.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 219 chips (54.8 BB), which is a decent stack. MiniMax-M2 has 351 chips. I'm not in danger of blinding out.\n\n**Decision reasoning:**\n1. My hand is very weak - King-high on an Ace-high board\n2. Opponent checked flop and turn, suggesting weakness\n3. However, any Ace, Jack, pair, or even Queen-high beats me\n4. The pot is small (10 chips)\n5. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands\n6. If I check, I might win if opponent also has nothing\n7. Given opponent's tendency to sometimes bet when they have something, their check on both streets suggests weakness\n\nI should check and hope my King-high is good. Betting with this weak hand would be a bluff, but the board is dry and opponent might call with any pair. The pot is too small to risk chips.\n\n**Final decision:** Check and hope to win with King-high."

The board is A J 5 6 8. There's no flush possible (two clubs, but not three of same suit). The board has straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9, but I only have 7, so I don't have a straight. My hand is essentially King-high, which is very weak on this board.\n\n**Betting history:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 limped (called), I checked from BB\n- Flop: Both checked\n- Turn: Both checked\n- River: Action is on me, no bet yet\n\n**Opponent analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the data, MiniMax-M2 has shown various betting patterns:\n- Sometimes aggressive with bets on flop/turn\n- Has raised preflop several times\n- Has called and limped in various spots\n- Has checked rivers before (Hand #23)\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 10 chips, I can check for free or bet. If I bet, I risk chips to win 10.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 219 chips (54.8 BB), which is a decent stack. MiniMax-M2 has 351 chips. I'm not in danger of blinding out.\n\n**Decision reasoning:**\n1. My hand is very weak - King-high on an Ace-high board\n2. Opponent checked flop and turn, suggesting weakness\n3. However, any Ace, Jack, pair, or even Queen-high beats me\n4. The pot is small (10 chips)\n5. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands\n6. If I check, I might win if opponent also has nothing\n7. Given opponent's tendency to sometimes bet when they have something, their check on both streets suggests weakness\n\nI should check and hope my King-high is good. Betting with this weak hand would be a bluff, but the board is dry and opponent might call with any pair. The pot is too small to risk chips.\n\n**Final decision:** Check and hope to win with King-high.",

On the button, I have position advantage. With only 2 chips to call into a 6-chip pot, I'm getting 3:1 pot odds preflop.\n\nMy recent history shows I've been folding a lot (win rate 13%, folded 33 of 38 hands). I need to play more hands, especially in position.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 56.8 BB, I have room to be selective but should defend my blinds and play positionally.\n\n**Decision:** 6\u26654\u2665 is marginal but playable on the button with only 2 chips to call. The pot odds are good (3:1). I have position, which is valuable. Folding seems too tight given the price. Raising doesn't make sense with this weak hand.\n\nI should call and see a flop. If I hit a draw or pair, I can continue. If not, I can fold cheaply.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Suited connector on button with position, getting 3:1 pot odds.

I want to see a turn card for free and potentially improve. If I improve to two pair or better, I can consider betting. If opponent bets on turn, I can easily fold with this marginal hand.\n\nChecking allows me to:\n1. See a free turn card\n2. Avoid bloating a small pot with a weak hand\n3. Use my position to react to opponent's actions\n\nI should not bet here because:\n- My hand is too weak for value\n- Opponent likely folds most hands that don't connect with this flop\n- If called, I'm usually behind\n- No fold equity against any pair or draw\n\nLet me check and see what happens on the turn.",

Pot is small (8 chips)\n2. My hand is marginal\n3. Opponent is passive\n4. I have position\n\nGiven the small pot and my marginal hand, raising seems unnecessary and could inflate the pot with a weak hand. Checking seems reasonable to see a free river and potentially improve. If I check, opponent might check behind, and we see a free river. If I bet, I might get called by better hands or fold out worse hands (though there aren't many worse hands that would call).\n\nActually, let me think about this more strategically. With bottom pair on a dry board, I could consider a small bet for value/protection. But what hands would call me that I beat? Possibly ace-high or worse pairs. But opponent likely has something if they're in the BB and didn't raise preflop. They could have a wide range.\n\nHowever, given the opponent's passive tendencies and the small pot, I think checking is fine. I can re-evaluate on the river.\n\n**Final Decision:** Check. Keep the pot small, see a free river, and potentially improve. If opponent bets on the river, I can re-evaluate based on bet size and board.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Bottom pair with weak kicker on dry board.

Small bet size suggests weakness or protection bet\n2. Good pot odds (25% equity needed)\n3. I have some showdown value with middle pair\n4. I have position on the river\n5. I have some straight outs (any 5 gives me a straight - 4 outs)\n6. Could improve to two pair or trips (2 more outs)\n\n**Estimated Equity:** With middle pair and 4 outs to a straight, plus some chance my pair is good, I likely have >25% equity against a weak range.\n\nGiven the small bet size, good pot odds, position, and some showdown value, I should call. Raising doesn't make sense with such a weak hand. Folding would be too tight given the price.\n\nI'll call and evaluate the river.",

They've mostly folded preflop, occasionally called. In hand #38, they checked down the entire hand (preflop call, then check-check-check). They don't seem aggressive postflop.\n\n**My hand strength:** Two pair is decent, but the river completed the flush. There are also straight possibilities (5-7 would make a straight, but board has 2-3-4-6-9). The flush is the main concern.\n\n**Possible opponent hands:**\n- Could have been betting a draw on turn (flush draw or straight draw)\n- Could have a pair + draw\n- Could have a made hand like a pair of 9s\n- Could be bluffing with missed draws\n\n**Decision:** Since amount to call is 0, I can check. But should I bet for value? Let me think:\n\n1. **Value bet considerations:** Two pair might be good here. Opponent might call with worse hands (one pair, worse two pair, maybe even a single 6 or 4).\n2. **Bluff considerations:** If opponent has a missed draw, they'll fold to a bet.\n3. **Check considerations:** If opponent has a flush, they'll bet when checked to. If they have a weak hand, they might check back.\n\nGiven the opponent's passive tendencies and the fact they bet small on the turn (half pot), they might not have a strong flush. A flush would likely bet bigger on turn or river. Their small bet suggests a medium strength hand or draw.\n\nI think a small value bet is reasonable. The pot is 16 chips. A bet of 8-10 chips (half pot) could get called by worse hands. If raised, I can fold.\n\nBut wait, I should consider tournament implications. I have 221 chips (55 BB), opponent has 343 chips. I'm not in danger of being short-stacked. A value bet here seems good.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: The board is 9d 3c 4c 2s 6c. The flush is clubs. My hand is 6h 4h. I have no clubs. So if opponent has any club, they have a flush. But would they call preflop with random clubs? Possibly, as BB defending wide.\n\nActually, thinking more: The turn was 2\u2660, making board 9\u2666 3\u2663 4\u2663 2\u2660. Opponent bet 4 into 8 pot. Then river 6\u2663 completes flush. So on turn, there was already a flush draw (two clubs). Opponent could have been betting a flush draw, which now got there.\n\nIf opponent had a flush draw on turn, they now have a flush. If they had a pair + flush draw, they now have a flush. So betting might be risky.\n\nBut they might also have a straight draw (5-7) or a pair of 9s, or a weak hand like A9.\n\nI think checking is safer. If I check and they bet, I can decide whether to call based on bet size. If they check back, I win the pot with two pair.\n\nActually, let me check the pot odds if they bet. Pot is 16. If they bet 8 (half pot), I need 8 to win 24, so 25% equity. If they have a flush, I have 0% equity. If they have one pair, I have ~90% equity. So I need to be right about 25% of the time.\n\nGiven opponent's passivity and small turn bet, I think checking and calling a reasonable bet (up to maybe 12 chips) is okay. But if they bet big, I should fold.\n\nActually, I think the best play is to check and evaluate their bet. This gives me more information and controls the pot size.\n\n**Final decision:** Check.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\nI'm on the river with 6h4h, board is 9d 3c 4c 2s 6c. I have two pair: sixes and fours. The river completed a club flush draw (6c on river). The pot is 16 chips, amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy opponent (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) bet 4 on the turn (which was 2s after flop 9d 3c 4c). I called. Now on river, opponent hasn't acted yet - I'm first to act on river.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've shown some decent hands at showdown: KK, 66, A5 suited, JQ, and 34 suited. They seem to play somewhat tight but not extremely so. They bet small on the turn (4 into 12 pot, 1/3 pot bet). This could be a value bet with a hand like a pair, or a draw.\n\nMy hand: Two pair is decent, but the flush got there. I have no clubs. Possible hands that beat me: any club flush (A high, K high, Q high, etc.), any straight (though board shows 9-3-4-2-6, so straight would need 5-7 or A-5, but 5-7 would be 5-6-7-8-9, not possible with this board; A-5 would be A-2-3-4-5, also not possible). Actually, looking at board: 9d 3c 4c 2s 6c. Possible straights: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 5,7,8) - not on board. A-2-3-4-5 (needs A,5) - not on board. So no straight possible.\n\nSo only flushes beat me. My opponent could have been betting a flush draw on turn that got there. Or they could have a pair and be betting for value.\n\nSince I'm first to act, I should consider betting for value against weaker hands like one pair, but also consider that if I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot. Checking might induce a bluff from missed draws or get value from worse hands that might bet.\n\nGiven the small pot (16 chips) and my stack (221 chips, 55 BB), I think checking is reasonable. If opponent checks behind, I still win with two pair. If they bet, I can evaluate based on bet size.\n\nLet me check.",

It's folded to me on the button.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression (raised to 40 in hand 33, raised to 8 in hand 34). Shows 9-8 suited/offsuit holdings in showdowns. Has folded the last few hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Seems to play fairly passively - calls and checks often. Showed 66, A5s, JQo, 43s, K6o in showdowns.\n\nMy position on the button is excellent. With pocket 7s, this is a medium pocket pair that plays well in position. I have 59 BB stack, which is healthy but not huge.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Pocket 7s is a hand that wants to see a flop cheaply and try to hit a set (about 12% chance). If I don't hit a set, it's often easy to fold.\n2. Being on the button gives me positional advantage postflop.\n3. The SB (seat 4) seems passive and may just complete if I call.\n4. The BB (seat 1) has shown aggression but has folded several recent hands.\n\nOptions:\n- Fold: Too conservative with a medium pocket pair on the button\n- Call: Standard play - see a flop cheaply, try to hit a set\n- Raise: Could be good to take initiative, but pocket 7s doesn't play great as a raise if called\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies and my position, calling seems optimal. I get to see a flop for cheap with good implied odds if I hit a set. Raising might fold out the blinds, but if called, I'm OOP against at least one player (SB would act before me postflop since he's in the blinds). Actually wait, I'm on the button, so I'd have position on everyone postflop. But still, pocket 7s doesn't want to build a big pot preflop without hitting a set.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips, I need to call 4. That's good pot odds (2:1). With implied odds if I hit a set, calling is good.\n\nI should call."

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 2, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB 4. It's folded to me on the button.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression (raised to 40 in hand 33, raised to 8 in hand 34). Shows 9-8 suited/offsuit holdings in showdowns. Has folded the last few hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Seems to play fairly passively - calls and checks often. Showed 66, A5s, JQo, 43s, K6o in showdowns.\n\nMy position on the button is excellent. With pocket 7s, this is a medium pocket pair that plays well in position. I have 59 BB stack, which is healthy but not huge.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Pocket 7s is a hand that wants to see a flop cheaply and try to hit a set (about 12% chance). If I don't hit a set, it's often easy to fold.\n2. Being on the button gives me positional advantage postflop.\n3. The SB (seat 4) seems passive and may just complete if I call.\n4. The BB (seat 1) has shown aggression but has folded several recent hands.\n\nOptions:\n- Fold: Too conservative with a medium pocket pair on the button\n- Call: Standard play - see a flop cheaply, try to hit a set\n- Raise: Could be good to take initiative, but pocket 7s doesn't play great as a raise if called\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies and my position, calling seems optimal. I get to see a flop for cheap with good implied odds if I hit a set. Raising might fold out the blinds, but if called, I'm OOP against at least one player (SB would act before me postflop since he's in the blinds). Actually wait, I'm on the button, so I'd have position on everyone postflop. But still, pocket 7s doesn't want to build a big pot preflop without hitting a set.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips, I need to call 4. That's good pot odds (2:1). With implied odds if I hit a set, calling is good.\n\nI should call.",

The pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + my call 4 + BB raise 8). I need to call 8 more.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising preflop quite often (7 times in the data I see). Their raises range from 6 to 40 chips. They've shown down hands like 9-8 suited, 9-8 offsuit - so they're playing somewhat loose. They raised to 12 in hand 21 and hand 31.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 7s is a medium pocket pair. It plays well in position (I'm on the button). Against a single opponent, this is a decent hand to continue with, especially in position.\n\nStack sizes: I have 233 chips (58 BB), opponent has 330 chips (82.5 BB). The raise is small relative to stacks.\n\nPosition: I have position advantage - I'm on the button, will act last postflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 18 (current pot) + 8 (my call) = 26. That's about 1:2.25 odds (31% equity needed). Pocket 7s vs a reasonable raising range has around 40-45% equity, so pot odds are favorable.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm not desperate for chips, but not huge either. Winning this pot would be nice.\n\nGiven the small raise size, my position advantage, and favorable pot odds, calling seems reasonable. Raising could also be considered to take initiative, but pocket 7s doesn't love facing a 3-bet, and the opponent might call with many hands that have good equity against us.\n\nLooking at my recent history: I've been folding a lot (33 folds out of 39 hands). I've won 2 small pots recently. Might be good to play a bit more aggressively.\n\nHowever, let me consider: If I call, the pot will be 26 chips. My stack is 225 after calling (233-8). That's still deep relative to the pot.\n\nI think calling is the standard play here. Folding would be too tight given the odds and position. Raising could be okay but might get us into trouble if opponent has a strong hand.\n\nLet's call."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI have pocket 7s on the button. I initially called the BB of 4, then the BB (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 12 total (8 more to call). The pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + my call 4 + BB raise 8). I need to call 8 more.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising preflop quite often (7 times in the data I see). Their raises range from 6 to 40 chips. They've shown down hands like 9-8 suited, 9-8 offsuit - so they're playing somewhat loose. They raised to 12 in hand 21 and hand 31.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 7s is a medium pocket pair. It plays well in position (I'm on the button). Against a single opponent, this is a decent hand to continue with, especially in position.\n\nStack sizes: I have 233 chips (58 BB), opponent has 330 chips (82.5 BB). The raise is small relative to stacks.\n\nPosition: I have position advantage - I'm on the button, will act last postflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 18 (current pot) + 8 (my call) = 26. That's about 1:2.25 odds (31% equity needed). Pocket 7s vs a reasonable raising range has around 40-45% equity, so pot odds are favorable.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm not desperate for chips, but not huge either. Winning this pot would be nice.\n\nGiven the small raise size, my position advantage, and favorable pot odds, calling seems reasonable. Raising could also be considered to take initiative, but pocket 7s doesn't love facing a 3-bet, and the opponent might call with many hands that have good equity against us.\n\nLooking at my recent history: I've been folding a lot (33 folds out of 39 hands). I've won 2 small pots recently. Might be good to play a bit more aggressively.\n\nHowever, let me consider: If I call, the pot will be 26 chips. My stack is 225 after calling (233-8). That's still deep relative to the pot.\n\nI think calling is the standard play here. Folding would be too tight given the odds and position. Raising could be okay but might get us into trouble if opponent has a strong hand.\n\nLet's call.",

Pot odds: I need to call 8 to win 26 total (18+8), so I need about 31% equity. Pocket 7s has that against most ranges.\n\nGiven my position advantage and the small raise size, calling seems best. I could consider raising, but pocket 7s doesn't play well against a 3-bet, and I'd prefer to see a flop cheaply and potentially hit a set or play postflop with position.\n\nSo I'll call. My response should be:\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 7s has good equity against opponent's likely raising range.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I have 7s7h on a Jc Ts 2c board. I'm on the button. The opponent (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised preflop from the BB to 12 total, I called. Now on the flop, opponent bets 16 into a pot of 42. I need to call 16 to win 58 (42+16). That's about 3.6:1 pot odds.\n\nMy hand: Middle pair with 7s. The board has Jc Ts 2c - two clubs, straight draws possible. My 7s are basically a bluff catcher here. The opponent could have a wide range: could be continuation betting with overcards, could have a jack, could have a draw, could have a ten, could have a bigger pair.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've been fairly active preflop with raises. On the flop, they've bet a few times (hand 12, 20) and raised once (hand 26). They seem to be aggressive.\n\nMy stack: 225 chips (56 BB) - decent but not huge. Opponent has 314 chips.\n\nGiven the board texture and my hand strength, I'm likely behind if opponent has any piece of this board. My 7s are vulnerable to overcards on turn/river. The flush draw and straight draws make this a dangerous board to continue with a marginal hand.\n\nHowever, I have position, which is valuable. The pot odds are decent (3.6:1). I need about 21% equity to call. Against a range of top pair, overpairs, draws, and some bluffs, I might have around 30-40% equity. But my hand has little improvement potential - only hitting a 7 (2 outs) or backdoor straight/flush possibilities.\n\nConsidering tournament implications: I have 56 BB, which is healthy. Folding here preserves my stack. Calling could lead to difficult decisions on future streets.\n\nLooking at opponent's flop betting: In hand 12 they bet 16 on flop (similar bet size). In hand 20 they bet 8 on flop (smaller). In hand 26 they raised on flop (aggressive).\n\nGiven the board texture (Jc Ts 2c) is quite coordinated with flush and straight draws, opponent might be betting with a wide range including draws. But my hand is weak and I'm out of position for the rest of the hand (actually I'm on button, so I have position - that's good).\n\nWait, I'm on the button, so I have position! That's actually a significant advantage. I can call and see a turn, then decide.\n\nBut my hand is really weak. Middle pair with bad kicker on a wet board. If I call, I'm likely calling again on turn if checked to, or facing another bet.\n\nI think the prudent play is to fold. The pot is small relative to my stack, and I'm likely behind or in a vulnerable spot. Better to wait for a better spot.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors: The opponent raised preflop from BB after I limped. Their range could be strong. They're now betting flop. This could be a standard continuation bet with a wide range, but my hand isn't strong enough to continue.\n\nI'll fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with Qs Jd. The SB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has just limped (called the BB). The pot is 16 chips (8 from me as BB, 4 from SB as SB, plus SB called additional 4). I have 217 chips (27.1 BB). Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nFrom the opponent action history, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been fairly active:\n- Hand 33: Called preflop with 80 chips (that seems like a big call)\n- Hand 34: Raised preflop to 8\n- Hand 40: Raised preflop to 12\n- Multiple folds in between\n\nThey seem to be playing a mixed strategy - sometimes raising, sometimes limping (like this hand), sometimes folding. The limp here from SB could indicate a weaker hand, as stronger hands might raise.\n\nMy hand: QJo is a decent hand from the BB. It's suited connectors (offsuit actually), but QJ is a strong enough hand to play heads-up against a SB limp. \n\nPosition: I'm out of position (BB vs SB), which is a disadvantage, but heads-up this is less severe.\n\nStack sizes: I have 217 chips (27.1 BB), opponent has 348 chips (43.5 BB). I'm slightly shorter stacked.\n\nOptions:\n1. Check: Play the hand for free, see a flop. This is safe but gives up initiative.\n2. Raise: Take control of the hand. A standard raise here would be to 24-32 chips (3-4x). \n\nConsidering the opponent's limp, they likely have a weak to medium hand. Raising could take it down preflop, or build a pot with a decent hand. QJo plays well heads-up.\n\nI should consider raising to about 24-28 chips. Let's say 24 chips (raising to 24 total, which is 16 more chips).\n\nThis is a good spot to raise for value and to take initiative. The opponent's limp suggests weakness, and I have position postflop (actually wait, I'm BB, SB acts first postflop, so I have position on the flop? Actually in heads-up, SB acts first preflop, but postflop the order is different. In heads-up, the BB acts first on flop, turn, river except preflop. So I'm out of position postflop. That's a consideration.)\n\nActually in heads-up: Preflop: SB acts first, BB last. Postflop: BB acts first on each street. So I'm out of position postflop. That makes checking more attractive.\n\nBut with QJo against a likely weak range, raising still has merit. I'll raise to 24.",

With 28.6 BB stack, better to preserve chips for stronger spots rather than play a speculative hand that could lead to difficult postflop decisions.

I've already posted the small blind of 4 chips, and the big blind (MiniMax-M2) has posted 8 chips. Seat 1 folded. So I need to decide whether to fold, call the additional 4 chips, or raise.\n\nKey factors:\n1. Hand strength: J6o is a weak hand. Jack-high with no suitedness, no connectivity. Very speculative.\n2. Position: I'm on the button, which is the best position postflop. This gives me an advantage if I see a flop.\n3. Stack sizes: I have 229 chips (28.6 BB), opponent has 333 chips (41.6 BB). I'm shorter stacked.\n4. Opponent tendencies: From the data, MiniMax-M2 has folded preflop in hands 40 and 41. They called in hand 38 (when in BB facing a raise?). They seem somewhat tight recently. But this is limited data.\n5. Pot odds: I need to call 4 to win a pot of 12 (my 4 SB + BB 8). That's 3:1 pot odds, or 25% equity needed.\n6. Tournament considerations: I have 28.6 BB, which is decent but not huge. Need to be careful with marginal hands.\n\nJ6o has about 30-35% equity against a random hand preflop. Against a typical BB defending range (maybe 50-60% of hands), it might have 30-33% equity. The pot odds of 25% suggest calling could be marginally profitable if I play well postflop.\n\nHowever, raising is also an option. A button steal attempt could work given opponent's recent folds. But J6o is a very weak hand to raise with - if I get called or 3-bet, I'm in a tough spot.\n\nGiven my stack size (28.6 BB), I don't want to get too involved with such a weak hand. But the pot odds are good, and position helps.\n\nLooking at my recent history: I've been folding a lot (34 folds out of 41 hands). I won hand 41 with QJ from BB by raising. I might be getting too tight.\n\nI think the best play is to fold. J6o is just too weak, even with position. The 4 chips to call is small, but playing this hand postflop could lead to losing more chips when I hit marginal hands. Better to wait for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations: Only one opponent left (the BB). So heads-up situation. In heads-up, J6o is not terrible, but still weak.\n\nGiven everything, I'll fold.",

The board has an Ace, 7, 8 with two diamonds. My hand is very weak - I have no pair, no flush draw, no straight draw. Best case scenario is runner-runner for a straight or hitting a King.\n\n2. **Opponent tendencies:** From the recall data, MiniMax-M2 has shown:\n   - In hand #32, they called preflop, checked flop, then raised 90 on flop with Ad 5d (Ace with diamond draw)\n   - In hand #39, they bet small (4 chips) on turn with Kd 6s\n   - Generally seems to call preflop with various hands and can be aggressive postflop with draws or made hands\n\n3. **Bet sizing analysis:** Opponent bet 16 into 72 pot (about 22% pot). This is a small bet. Could be:\n   - A weak Ace trying to get value from worse\n   - A draw (flush draw or straight draw) \n   - A complete bluff\n\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 16 to win 88 (72 + 16). That's about 18% pot odds. I need roughly 18% equity to call.\n\n5. **My equity:** With King-high on this board, I have very little equity. Against a range of Ax, 7x, 8x, flush draws, straight draws - I'm probably around 10-15% equity at best.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** I have 25.6 BB stack, which is decent but not huge. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n7. **Position:** I'm on the button, which is good, but my hand is just too weak.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. The small bet size could be a probe bet, but with King-high and no draws, I don't have enough equity to continue. Even if opponent is bluffing, I have no way to improve on most turns. Better to wait for a better spot with my 25.6 BB stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"King-high with no draws on A-7-8 board.

The board has Q-K, so I'm behind any Q, K, or pair. My best outs are backdoor flush draw (hearts) and backdoor straight possibilities (need J-T or 9-8). Not a great hand on this board.\n\n2. **Opponent analysis**: From the recalled data, Kimi-K2 Thinking seems tight - folded preflop in 7 of 10 hands, raised once (hand #40), and called once. In hand #40, they raised preflop then bet the flop. This suggests they might be playing strong hands when they raise preflop.\n\n3. **Preflop action**: Opponent raised from SB to 16 total (min-raise), I called from BB. This is a standard call with A7o from BB getting good odds.\n\n4. **Flop situation**: Opponent checked. This could mean:\n   - They missed with a smaller pocket pair or suited connectors\n   - They have a weak hand like A-x and are giving up\n   - They're trapping with a strong hand (set, two pair, top pair)\n   - They have a draw and want to check-call\n\n5. **My options**:\n   - **Check**: See a free turn card. With my weak hand, this seems reasonable.\n   - **Bet**: Could try to take the pot down now with a bet, but risk getting raised or called by better hands.\n   - **Raise**: Not applicable since no bet to raise.\n\n6. **Stack preservation**: I have 23.6 BB, which is short but not desperate. The tournament is still early.\n\nGiven the board texture (Q-K-5 with two clubs), my Ace-high is likely not good. However, the opponent's check suggests weakness. A small bet could potentially win the pot, but if called, I'm likely behind and will have to give up on later streets.\n\nBetter to check and see the turn.

The board is Qc Kd 5c 9s. I have no pair, no draw. Best case scenario is I have Ace-high. There's a flush draw with clubs on board (Qc, 5c, plus 9s and Kd). I have no flush draw.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the data, Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised preflop frequently (9 times found). They've checked turn 3 times in past hands. No showdown data available. They raised preflop to 16 (min-raise from SB), which could be a wide range.\n\n**Pot odds and situation:**\nPot is 32 chips. I'm out of position. My hand is weak - just Ace-high. The opponent checked turn, which could indicate weakness or a trap. With Ace-high and no draws, I'm likely behind any pair. The K and Q on board are high cards that likely hit opponent's raising range.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have 23.6 BB, which is a decent stack but not huge. Being out of position with a weak hand suggests caution.\n\n**Possible actions:**\n1. Check: See a free river, but then face potential river bet.\n2. Bet: Try to take down pot now, but risk being called or raised.\n\nGiven my weak hand and out-of-position, checking seems prudent. If I bet and get called, I'm likely behind and will have to decide on river with no improvement. If I bet and get raised, I have to fold.\n\nThe pot is small relative to stacks. Checking keeps pot small and allows me to potentially bluff-catch on river if opponent shows weakness again.\n\nLet me check:{\"action\": \"check\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"Weak Ace-high hand with no draws, out of position.

They might also have a flush with AcXc.\n2. **Bluffs**: They checked flop and turn, so they might be betting a missed draw on the river as a bluff.\n\nMy hand is very weak - Ace-high on a board where many better hands exist. The pot odds: I need to call 24 to win 80 (56+24). That's 30% pot odds. I need to win at least 30% of the time to make this call profitable.\n\nConsidering opponent's play:\n- They raised preflop from SB, so their range includes many hands\n- They checked flop and turn, which could indicate weakness or slow-playing\n- River bet of 43% pot could be a value bet with medium strength or a bluff\n\nGiven my stack size (23.6 BB), this is a significant portion of my stack. I have 189 chips, and calling 24 would put me at 165 chips (20.6 BB). That's still playable but getting short.\n\nWhat bluffs could they have? Missed straight draws like T8, T7, or missed flush draws. But with the club flush draw getting there, if they had a flush draw, they might have bet earlier or might have made the flush.\n\nGiven the board texture and my weak hand, I think this is a fold. The opponent is likely to have at least a pair here, and Ace-high rarely wins at showdown on this board.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any history of this opponent bluffing rivers. The data shows they've bet rivers before, but without showdown information, I don't know if those were value bets or bluffs.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and pot odds, I think folding is correct. My hand has very little showdown value, and I can find better spots with my remaining stack."

They might also have a flush with AcXc.\n2. **Bluffs**: They checked flop and turn, so they might be betting a missed draw on the river as a bluff.\n\nMy hand is very weak - Ace-high on a board where many better hands exist. The pot odds: I need to call 24 to win 80 (56+24). That's 30% pot odds. I need to win at least 30% of the time to make this call profitable.\n\nConsidering opponent's play:\n- They raised preflop from SB, so their range includes many hands\n- They checked flop and turn, which could indicate weakness or slow-playing\n- River bet of 43% pot could be a value bet with medium strength or a bluff\n\nGiven my stack size (23.6 BB), this is a significant portion of my stack. I have 189 chips, and calling 24 would put me at 165 chips (20.6 BB). That's still playable but getting short.\n\nWhat bluffs could they have? Missed straight draws like T8, T7, or missed flush draws. But with the club flush draw getting there, if they had a flush draw, they might have bet earlier or might have made the flush.\n\nGiven the board texture and my weak hand, I think this is a fold. The opponent is likely to have at least a pair here, and Ace-high rarely wins at showdown on this board.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any history of this opponent bluffing rivers. The data shows they've bet rivers before, but without showdown information, I don't know if those were value bets or bluffs.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and pot odds, I think folding is correct. My hand has very little showdown value, and I can find better spots with my remaining stack.",

This is a terrible board for Ace-high. Any pair beats me. The board has straight and flush possibilities. The opponent checked flop and turn, then bet river. This could be a value bet with a medium pair (like Kx, Qx, Jx) or a missed draw bluff.\n\nGiven my stack size (189 chips, 23.6 BB), calling 24 chips (12.7% of my stack) is significant. I need to win at least 30% of the time to break even. With Ace-high on this board, I doubt I win 30% against a river bet.\n\nThe opponent raised preflop from SB, so their range includes many hands. They checked flop and turn, which could indicate weakness or slow-play. River bet could be trying to extract value from worse hands or bluffing a missed draw.\n\nBut what missed draws? Straight draws that missed would be hands like T8, T7, 86, etc. Flush draws that missed would be non-club hands. But with the club flush draw getting there, if they had a flush draw, they might have bet earlier or might have made the flush.\n\nI think this is a fold. My hand has very little showdown value. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nJSON response should be:\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Ace-high on this board has minimal showdown value.

With 30% pot odds needed and likely less than 30% equity, folding preserves stack for better opportunities.\"\n}\n\nWait, let me double-check the action sequence: Opponent raised preflop from SB to 16 (2x BB), I called from BB with A7o. Then opponent checked flop and turn, then bet river. This line could be a missed draw bluff, but also could be a slow-played strong hand.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and my stack size, I think fold is correct.",

The action: I posted SB 4, BB posted 8, and Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) just called 8. So I need to call 4 more to complete my SB.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression with raises preflop (hands 40 and 44), but here just called. From showdowns, they've played 98s type hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): In BB, will act after me. They've shown some loose calls (hand 43 called 20 preflop) and has shown down various hands from pairs to suited connectors.\n\nMy hand Q2o is terrible. Even from the SB, this is a fold in most situations. However, I'm getting 4:1 pot odds (pot is 20, I need to call 4). But postflop, I'll be out of position against 2 players, which makes playing this hand very difficult.\n\nMy stack is 185 (23.1 BB), which is short but not desperate. In tournament play with short stacks, I should be looking for better spots. The BB has a big stack and could easily raise if I just complete.\n\nConsidering tournament dynamics: I have 7 wins in 44 hands (16% win rate), so I've been relatively tight. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nThe fact that Seat 1 just called instead of raising might indicate weakness, but Q2o is still trash. Even if I hit a Q on flop, I could be dominated by better queens.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. The 4 chips I'd lose completing are better saved for when I have a real hand.\n\nDecision: Fold."

The action: I posted SB 4, BB posted 8, and Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) just called 8. So I need to call 4 more to complete my SB.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression with raises preflop (hands 40 and 44), but here just called. From showdowns, they've played 98s type hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): In BB, will act after me. They've shown some loose calls (hand 43 called 20 preflop) and has shown down various hands from pairs to suited connectors.\n\nMy hand Q2o is terrible. Even from the SB, this is a fold in most situations. However, I'm getting 4:1 pot odds (pot is 20, I need to call 4). But postflop, I'll be out of position against 2 players, which makes playing this hand very difficult.\n\nMy stack is 185 (23.1 BB), which is short but not desperate. In tournament play with short stacks, I should be looking for better spots. The BB has a big stack and could easily raise if I just complete.\n\nConsidering tournament dynamics: I have 7 wins in 44 hands (16% win rate), so I've been relatively tight. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nThe fact that Seat 1 just called instead of raising might indicate weakness, but Q2o is still trash. Even if I hit a Q on flop, I could be dominated by better queens.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. The 4 chips I'd lose completing are better saved for when I have a real hand.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm on the button with K7 offsuit. My stack is 185 chips (23.1 BB). The blinds are 4/8. The small blind (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) posted 4, and the big blind (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted 8. There are no other players in the hand - seats 2 and 5 are already folded.\n\nI need to decide whether to fold, call (limp), or raise. Looking at my hand history, I see I've played K7 before in hand #38 (BB position) and won a small pot by checking down. But that was from BB, not button.\n\nAnalyzing the hand: K7o is a weak hand. King-high with a weak kicker. However, I'm on the button with position advantage. The opponents are the small blind and big blind. Looking at opponent tendencies:\n\nKimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB): Has raised once preflop in hand #44, folded twice, and called once. Seems somewhat tight but not overly aggressive.\n\nMiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB): Has mostly folded or checked preflop. Called once against my raise in hand #43, then bet the flop.\n\nMy stack is 23 BB, which is getting short. In tournament poker, with 23 BB, I need to be looking for spots to accumulate chips. However, K7o is not a good hand to open with from the button. The standard play with 23 BB on the button would be to open-raise with a wider range, but K7o is borderline.\n\nConsidering pot odds: I need to call 8 chips into a pot of 12 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. That's decent, but I'd be playing out of position if I just call (the blinds would act after me postflop, but actually I'm on button so I have position postflop).\n\nBetter options:\n1. Fold - conservative play with a weak hand\n2. Raise - standard button open to 2.5-3x BB (20-24 chips)\n3. Call - limp in to see a cheap flop\n\nGiven my stack size (23 BB), I should be looking to open-raise with a reasonable range from the button. K7o is marginal but might be playable. However, looking at my recent history, I raised with Th Ks from button in hand #43 and lost. I also raised with 77 from button in hand #40 and had to fold on flop.\n\nThe safer play is to fold this weak hand and wait for a better spot. With 23 BB, I'm not desperate yet, but getting short. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nI'll fold.",

So it's heads-up between me and MiniMax-M2.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 177 chips (22.1 BB). MiniMax-M2 has 357 chips (44.6 BB). I'm the short stack at the table.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, MiniMax-M2 has been fairly passive preflop - mostly folding, occasionally calling, and only one instance of betting postflop (hand 43). They called a raise of 20 in hand 43 preflop, then bet 16 on the flop. This suggests they're not overly aggressive.\n\n5. **Current situation**: The pot is 20 chips (4+8+8). Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise. Minimum raise to 16 total (8 more).\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I'm the short stack with 22.1 BB. This is getting into push/fold territory. With QTs in the BB against one limper, this is a decent spot to potentially pick up the pot preflop or play a hand in position postflop.\n\n7. **Options**:\n   - **Check**: Take a free flop with QTs. This is safe but gives up initiative.\n   - **Raise**: Standard would be to raise to 24-32 total. This could win the pot preflop or get heads-up with initiative.\n\nGiven my stack size and the fact that MiniMax-M2 has shown some passivity, raising seems reasonable. QTs plays well heads-up, and I have position advantage postflop (since the action will go to me last on each street).\n\nA raise to 24-28 total (16-20 more) would be reasonable.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have 4d 3c - a very weak hand, suited connectors but not connected (43o)\n- Position: BTN (good position)\n- Stack: 193 chips (24.1 BB) - medium stack\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- Amount to call: 4 chips (half a small blind)\n- Only one opponent: MiniMax-M2 in BB with 349 chips\n\n**Opponent analysis from search:**\n- MiniMax-M2 seems to play somewhat straightforward\n- Has raised preflop multiple times (9 times found)\n- In recent hands, has folded to my raises (hand #47: folded to my 28 chip raise with Qh Th)\n- Has called raises preflop (hand #43: called my 24 chip raise)\n- Generally seems to play somewhat tight/passive\n\n**My situation:**\n- I'm the small blind, posted 4 chips\n- BB posted 8 chips\n- Only 4 more chips to call to see a flop\n- Pot odds: 4 to call into 12 pot = 3:1 odds (25% equity needed)\n\n**Hand strength considerations:**\n- 43o is a very weak hand\n- Even with position, this hand has poor equity against a random hand\n- Best case scenarios: flop two pair, trips, or a straight draw\n- Implied odds could be good if we hit a strong hand\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 24 BB, which is playable but not huge\n- Losing 4 chips is only 2% of my stack\n- If I fold, I lose my 4 chip SB anyway\n- Calling 4 more gives me a chance to win 12 chips\n\n**Decision:**\nThe pot odds are excellent (3:1), and I only need 25% equity. While 43o has only about 32% equity against a random hand, the implied odds could be decent if I hit something strong. With position, I can control the pot postflop. The cost is minimal (2% of stack).\n\nHowever, 43o is one of the worst possible hands. Even with good odds, playing such a weak hand can lead to difficult postflop decisions and potentially losing more chips. Given my stack size and tournament considerations, folding might be better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nLooking at my recent history: I've been raising with decent hands (KT, QTo) and winning pots preflop. This is a very marginal spot.\n\nI think the best play is to **fold**. The hand is too weak, and while the immediate pot odds are good, the reverse implied odds are poor - if I hit a marginal hand like a pair of 4s or 3s, I could lose a lot more chips. Better to wait for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand**: Ac Jc (suited AJ)\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - excellent position\n**Stack**: 193 chips (24.1 BB) - moderately short-stacked\n**Opponents**: \n- Seat 4 (SB): MiniMax-M2 with 357 chips, posted 4\n- Seat 1 (BB): Kimi-K2 Thinking with 360 chips, posted 8\n\n**Preflop action**: SB posted 4, BB posted 8. It's folded to me on the button.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: AJs is a strong hand, especially suited. It's a top 5% hand. From the button with no action yet, this is a clear raising hand.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is the best position. I can control the action post-flop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: At 24 BB, I'm getting into short-stack territory. Need to accumulate chips but also be careful about risking my stack.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB): Has shown some aggression (raised preflop in hand 44), but also folded the last two hands preflop. Might be playing tight.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has shown some loose calls (called 20 with A5s in hand 43), but also folds frequently. Has shown showdowns with marginal hands.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 24 BB, I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips. AJs on the button is definitely one of those spots.\n\n**Options**:\n- **Fold**: Too weak with AJs on button\n- **Call**: Could be okay but doesn't build the pot or take initiative\n- **Raise**: Standard play. Builds the pot, takes initiative, can win blinds uncontested.\n\n**Raise sizing**: Minimum raise to 16 (2x) or go slightly larger? With 24 BB stack, a 2.5x-3x raise is standard. Minimum raise to 16 is 2x BB. Given my stack size, I could raise to 20-24 (2.5x-3x). But with only 24 BB, I need to be careful about committing too much.\n\nActually, looking at my stack: 193 chips. If I raise to 20 (2.5x), that's 10.4% of my stack. If called, pot would be ~44, and I'd have 173 behind (21.6 BB). That's reasonable.\n\n**Decision**: Raise to 20-24. Let me go with 20 (2.5x) to keep some fold equity and not commit too much.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 20,\n  \"reasoning\": \"AJs on button is a strong raising hand. With 24 BB stack, need to accumulate chips. Standard 2.5x raise takes initiative, can win blinds uncontested, and maintains good stack-to-pot ratio if called.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm on the button with Ac Jc. I raised to 20 (2.5x BB). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) in the small blind 3-bet to 32 total (which is a raise of 12 more than my bet). Seat 1 (BB) folded. I need to call 12 more chips.\n\nCurrent pot: 60 chips (my 20 + SB's 32 + BB's 8)\nAmount to call: 12\nMy stack: 173 chips (21.6 BB)\n\nLooking at opponent history: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has shown some weak hands at showdown: Ad5d, JsQc, 3h4h, Kd6s, Td7d. They seem to play a wide range. They haven't shown many aggressive 3-bets from what I can see. This 3-bet from the small blind could be a squeeze play or a genuine strong hand.\n\nMy hand: AJo suited is a strong hand, but vulnerable to a 3-bet. Against a typical 3-bet range from the small blind, AJo has about 40% equity. However, given the opponent's shown wide range, they might be 3-betting lighter.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 12 to win 60, so I need 12/(60+12) = 12/72 = 16.7% equity. Even against a tight range, AJo has more than this.\n\nStack sizes: I have 173 chips (21.6 BB), opponent has 329 chips. If I call, pot will be 72 chips, and I'll have 161 chips left (20 BB). This gives me good implied odds if I hit a flop.\n\nPosition: I'm on the button, which is advantageous post-flop.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm short-stacked (21.6 BB), so I need to accumulate chips. Folding here would leave me with 173 chips, which is still playable but not ideal. Calling seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, I could also consider 4-betting. Minimum raise to 44 would put in 24 more chips. But with AJo and my stack size, 4-betting might commit me to the pot. If I 4-bet and get shoved on, I'd have to call with AJo, which might be marginal.\n\nGiven the pot odds and position, calling seems like the most balanced play. I'll see a flop and evaluate from there.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pot odds favorable (16.7% needed, AJo has >40% vs wide range). Position advantage on button. Opponent has shown wide range at showdown. Calling preserves stack flexibility and allows post-flop play with suited ace.\"\n}",

This is a very strong draw - any club gives me the nut flush. I also have an overcard (Ace) which could be good if opponent doesn't have AA/KK. I have approximately 12 outs (9 clubs + 3 Aces), giving me about 45% equity against a made hand.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the button, which is advantageous post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent Analysis:** From the data, MiniMax-M2 is quite aggressive preflop (9 raises in 48 hands). On the flop, they've bet 11 times out of 48 hands. Their 3-bet preflop suggests a strong range: likely pairs 99+, AK, AQ, maybe some suited connectors. The flop bet of 36 into 108 is a continuation bet sizing.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 108, I need to call 36. That's pot odds of 3:1 (25% equity needed). My flush draw alone gives me about 35% equity to hit by the river. With implied odds (if I hit my flush, I can win more on later streets), this is a profitable call.\n\n5. **Stack Sizes:** I have 161 total, opponent has 293. If I call, I'll have 125 left. The pot will be 180. This sets up potential turn decisions well.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I'm at 20.1 BB, which is short but not critical. Need to accumulate chips but also preserve stack.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold:** Too weak given my strong draw and good pot odds.\n- **Call:** Solid choice - see a turn card cheaply with good implied odds.\n- **Raise:** Could be considered as a semi-bluff. If I raise to ~120, I put pressure on opponent and could win immediately. However, with only 161 total, a raise commits me.\n\nGiven my stack size (161), if I raise to say 120, I'd be pot-committed. A better approach might be to call and evaluate turn. If I hit my flush, I can get more value. If I miss, I can decide based on opponent's action.\n\nThe flop is dry (5c 9d 2c), so opponent's range likely includes overpairs (TT+, maybe 99), AK, AQ. My flush draw is strong against this range.\n\n**Decision:** I'll call and see the turn. The pot odds justify it, and I have position advantage."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- My hand: Ac Jc (nut flush draw + overcard)\n- Board: 5c 9d 2c (rainbow with my flush draw)\n- Pot: 108 chips\n- To call: 36 chips\n- My stack: 161 chips (20.1 BB)\n- Opponent (Seat 4 - MiniMax-M2): 293 chips\n\n**Hand History:**\n- Preflop: I raised to 20 from BTN, MiniMax-M2 3-bet to 32 from SB, I called\n- Flop: MiniMax-M2 bets 36 (about 1/3 pot)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength:** I have the nut flush draw with Ac Jc. This is a very strong draw - any club gives me the nut flush. I also have an overcard (Ace) which could be good if opponent doesn't have AA/KK. I have approximately 12 outs (9 clubs + 3 Aces), giving me about 45% equity against a made hand.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the button, which is advantageous post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent Analysis:** From the data, MiniMax-M2 is quite aggressive preflop (9 raises in 48 hands). On the flop, they've bet 11 times out of 48 hands. Their 3-bet preflop suggests a strong range: likely pairs 99+, AK, AQ, maybe some suited connectors. The flop bet of 36 into 108 is a continuation bet sizing.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 108, I need to call 36. That's pot odds of 3:1 (25% equity needed). My flush draw alone gives me about 35% equity to hit by the river. With implied odds (if I hit my flush, I can win more on later streets), this is a profitable call.\n\n5. **Stack Sizes:** I have 161 total, opponent has 293. If I call, I'll have 125 left. The pot will be 180. This sets up potential turn decisions well.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I'm at 20.1 BB, which is short but not critical. Need to accumulate chips but also preserve stack.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold:** Too weak given my strong draw and good pot odds.\n- **Call:** Solid choice - see a turn card cheaply with good implied odds.\n- **Raise:** Could be considered as a semi-bluff. If I raise to ~120, I put pressure on opponent and could win immediately. However, with only 161 total, a raise commits me.\n\nGiven my stack size (161), if I raise to say 120, I'd be pot-committed. A better approach might be to call and evaluate turn. If I hit my flush, I can get more value. If I miss, I can decide based on opponent's action.\n\nThe flop is dry (5c 9d 2c), so opponent's range likely includes overpairs (TT+, maybe 99), AK, AQ. My flush draw is strong against this range.\n\n**Decision:** I'll call and see the turn. The pot odds justify it, and I have position advantage.",

Pot odds: 36 to win 144 (108+36), so need ~25% equity. Flush draw has ~35% equity by river, plus overcard outs. Good pot odds.\n\nPosition: I'm on button, good for controlling pot.\n\nStack sizes: If I call, pot becomes 180, I have 125 left. Good implied odds if I hit flush.\n\nOpponent: 3-bet preflop, continuation bet on flop. Could have overpair or AK/AQ.\n\nOptions: fold (too weak), call (good), raise (semi-bluff but commits me).\n\nCall seems optimal. Let me check if I should consider raise. Raising to maybe 120 would be a strong semi-bluff. But with my stack, I'd have 41 left if called, essentially committed. Might be better to call and keep pot control.\n\nYes, call is best.

On this paired board (5c 9d 2c 5s), I have 9 outs for the flush (clubs). The Ace might be good sometimes but board is paired so could be up against a full house if opponent has a 5.\n\n2. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the data, MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression - bet on turn in hand 39, bet on flop in hand 43. This is their first 3-bet preflop that I've seen. They 3-bet from SB after my BTN raise, which could be a wide range.\n\n3. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 180, need to call 36. That's 5:1 pot odds (16.7% equity needed). My flush draw has ~18% equity to hit on river (9 outs). With implied odds if I hit, I could win more. But my stack is only 125 total, and I've already invested 20+12+36 = 68 chips.\n\n4. **Stack Size:** I have 125 chips total. After calling this 36, I'd have 89 left. If I miss river, I'm in a tough spot with only 89 chips.\n\n5. **Opponent's Range:** They 3-bet preflop, bet flop, bet turn. Could have: overpairs (99, 22, maybe TT-QQ), maybe A5s, maybe 9x with a 5, maybe bluffs. The turn 5 pairs the board, which reduces my Ace outs if they have a 5.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I'm short-stacked (15.6 BB). Need to accumulate chips. This is a decent spot with nut flush draw, but need to consider if I should raise instead of call.\n\n**Possible Actions:**\n- **Fold:** Too tight given pot odds and nut flush draw\n- **Call:** Reasonable, getting good pot odds for flush draw\n- **Raise:** Could go all-in (125 total). This would be a semi-bluff with flush draw + overcards. If they fold, we win 180 pot. If they call, we have decent equity.\n\nGiven my short stack and the fact that I'm getting good pot odds (5:1), calling seems reasonable. But raising all-in could also be good - it puts pressure on opponent and I have fold equity plus equity if called.\n\nLet me check if opponent has shown any folds to aggression."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: Ac Jc (nut flush draw, overcards)\n- Board: 5c 9d 2c 5s (paired board with flush draw)\n- Pot: 180 chips\n- To call: 36 chips\n- My stack: 125 chips (15.6 BB)\n- Opponent (MiniMax-M2): 257 chips, SB position\n\n**Hand History:**\n- Preflop: I raised to 20 (BTN), MiniMax-M2 3-bet to 32 from SB, I called 12\n- Flop: 5c 9d 2c, MiniMax-M2 bet 36, I called 36\n- Turn: 5s (board pairs), MiniMax-M2 bets 36 again\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** I have the nut flush draw (A-high flush draw) + overcards (Ace). On this paired board (5c 9d 2c 5s), I have 9 outs for the flush (clubs). The Ace might be good sometimes but board is paired so could be up against a full house if opponent has a 5.\n\n2. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the data, MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression - bet on turn in hand 39, bet on flop in hand 43. This is their first 3-bet preflop that I've seen. They 3-bet from SB after my BTN raise, which could be a wide range.\n\n3. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 180, need to call 36. That's 5:1 pot odds (16.7% equity needed). My flush draw has ~18% equity to hit on river (9 outs). With implied odds if I hit, I could win more. But my stack is only 125 total, and I've already invested 20+12+36 = 68 chips.\n\n4. **Stack Size:** I have 125 chips total. After calling this 36, I'd have 89 left. If I miss river, I'm in a tough spot with only 89 chips.\n\n5. **Opponent's Range:** They 3-bet preflop, bet flop, bet turn. Could have: overpairs (99, 22, maybe TT-QQ), maybe A5s, maybe 9x with a 5, maybe bluffs. The turn 5 pairs the board, which reduces my Ace outs if they have a 5.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I'm short-stacked (15.6 BB). Need to accumulate chips. This is a decent spot with nut flush draw, but need to consider if I should raise instead of call.\n\n**Possible Actions:**\n- **Fold:** Too tight given pot odds and nut flush draw\n- **Call:** Reasonable, getting good pot odds for flush draw\n- **Raise:** Could go all-in (125 total). This would be a semi-bluff with flush draw + overcards. If they fold, we win 180 pot. If they call, we have decent equity.\n\nGiven my short stack and the fact that I'm getting good pot odds (5:1), calling seems reasonable. But raising all-in could also be good - it puts pressure on opponent and I have fold equity plus equity if called.\n\nLet me check if opponent has shown any folds to aggression.",

That's 5:1 odds. My flush draw has about 18% chance to hit on river (9/46 \u2248 19.6%). Actually 9 outs out of 46 unknown cards = 19.6%. So pot odds are good - I need 16.7% equity, I have ~19.6% just for flush. Plus some chance Ace is good, though board is paired so Ace might not be clean outs.\n\nBut I also have to consider my stack size: 125 total. If I call, I'll have 89 left on river. If I miss, I'll be in tough spot with only 89 chips (11 BB). \n\nOpponent bet 36 into 180 pot - that's a small bet (20% pot). Could be trying to get value from weaker hands or continuation bet. The turn card (5s) pairs the board, which could slow down some hands but they still bet same size.\n\nGiven my short stack and tournament situation, I think calling is reasonable. Raising all-in is also possible as a semi-bluff, but I'm getting good direct pot odds to just call.\n\nActually, let me calculate: If I call 36, pot becomes 216. I have 89 left. If I hit flush on river, I can potentially get the rest of my stack in. So implied odds are decent.\n\nI think calling is the best play here. Let me respond with JSON.",

          "content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with Ac Jc. Board: 5c 9d 2c 5s Ah. I have top pair with ace kicker and a flush draw that missed (only one club on board). Actually board shows 5c, 9d, 2c, 5s, Ah. So there are two clubs: 5c and 2c. I have Ac Jc, so I have ace-high flush draw that didn't come in. But I have top pair with ace, and the board paired fives. So I have Aces with jack kicker, but there's a possible full house (someone could have a five). Opponent bet 36 on river after betting 36 on flop and turn.\n\nMy stack: 89 chips. Pot is 252 chips. Amount to call: 36. I have 89 total, and I've already invested some. Let me calculate: I started with 89, but I've already called preflop raise, flop bet, turn bet. Actually let me trace: preflop I raised to 20, then opponent raised to 32, I called 12 more. So preflop I put in 20 total? Actually my raise was to 20, then opponent raised to 32, I called 12 more, so total preflop investment: 32? Wait: I raised to 20, opponent raised to 32 (additional 12 from my 20? Actually opponent's raise to 32 means total pot. I had already put 20, need to add 12 to match 32, so I called 12. So preflop I put in 32 total.\n\nFlop: opponent bet 36, I called 36. Turn: opponent bet 36, I called 36. So total invested: 32 + 36 + 36 = 104? That's more than my stack of 89. Something off. Let me recalc: My stack is 89 chips at start of hand. Preflop: I raised to 20 (so 20 chips). Then opponent raised to 32, I called 12 more, so total preflop: 32 chips. That leaves 57 chips. Flop: opponent bet 36, I called 36, leaving 21 chips. Turn: opponent bet 36, but I only have 21 left? Actually I have 21 after flop call, but opponent bet 36, I can only call 21 (all-in). But description says \"turn: Seat 3 call 36\". That suggests I had 36 to call. Possibly my stack was larger at start of hand? Let me check: \"Your Stack: 89 chips (11.1 BB)\" at river stage. But maybe I had more earlier? The hand history might show cumulative. Let me think: At river, I have 89 chips. Pot is 252. Opponent bet 36. So I have 89 chips behind. That means I haven't put all my chips in yet. So my earlier calculation is wrong.\n\nLet me reconstruct: Starting stack 89. Preflop: I raise to 20 (put 20 in). Opponent raises to 32 (I need to add 12 to match). So I call 12 more, total invested 32. Stack now 57. Flop: opponent bets 36, I call 36. Stack now 21. Turn: opponent bets 36, but I only have 21, so I call 21 all-in? But description says \"turn: Seat 3 call 36\". That might be a mistake, or maybe I had more chips. Actually maybe my stack at start of hand was larger than 89? The 89 is current stack at river. That means I've already put in chips, but still have 89 left. So starting stack must have been larger. Let's calculate backwards: At river I have 89. I need to call 36. If I call, I'll have 53 left. So I've already put in (starting stack - 89). But we don't know starting stack. However, the pot is 252 chips. That includes all bets so far. Let's calculate total pot: Preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, I raised to 20, opponent raised to 32, I called 12. So preflop pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + my 20 + opponent's 32? Actually opponent's raise to 32 includes his SB of 4? Let's not get bogged down.\n\nBetter to focus on decision: I have top pair with ace kicker, board paired fives. Opponent has been betting all streets: preflop 3-bet, flop bet, turn bet, river bet. This looks like a strong hand. Could"

          "content": "I need to analyze this river decision. I have Ac Jc, board: 5c 9d 2c 5s Ah. I have top pair with ace and jack kicker. The board paired fives, so there's a possible full house if opponent has a five. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has been betting consistently: preflop 3-bet, flop bet, turn bet, river bet. This line is strong.\n\nFrom opponent history: I see they've shown down various hands: Ad 5d (pair of fives with ace kicker), Js Qc (jack high), 3h 4h (straight draw), Kd 6s (pair of sixes), Td 7d (ten high). They've raised preflop multiple times. They tend to check rivers rather than bet. In 7 river actions, all were check or fold, no bets. This is their first river bet observed. That suggests this river bet is strong.\n\nPot is 252 chips, I need to call 36. That's pot odds of 252:36 or 7:1. I need about 12.5% equity to call. I have top pair with jack kicker. What can they have? They 3-bet preflop, so range includes: strong aces (AK, AQ, maybe AJ, AT), pairs (TT+, maybe 99, 88), suited connectors maybe. They bet flop on 5c 9d 2c board. That's a dry board except for flush draw. They bet turn when 5s pairs the board. Now river brings Ah, giving me top pair. But this ace might improve their hand if they have AX. They could have AK, AQ, maybe AT. They could have a five (A5, 55, maybe suited connectors with five). 55 is unlikely as only one combo left (since two fives on board). A5 suited possible. They could have an overpair like TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA. AA unlikely as I have an ace. KK possible.\n\nMy hand: Aces with jack kicker. If they have AK or AQ, I'm beat. If they have AT, I win. If they have a five, I'm beat. If they have an overpair like KK, QQ, JJ, I'm beat (JJ ties). If they have a bluff with missed flush draw or straight draw, I win.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to check rivers, this bet looks value-heavy. They're likely betting for value with a hand that beats top pair. They might have AK, AQ, or a five. They could also have a slow-played set of nines or deuces, but those would likely check river after pairing board? Actually set of nines would be full house now (9s full of fives). That's possible.\n\nMy stack is 89 chips (11.1 BB). Tournament considerations: I'm short-stacked. Folding leaves me with 89 chips (11.1 BB). Calling and losing leaves me with 53 chips (6.6 BB). Calling and winning gives me 89 + 252 = 341 chips? Actually if I call 36 and win, I get the pot of 252 + opponent's river bet 36 + my call 36 = 324 total pot? Wait, pot is 252 before river bet. Opponent bet 36, making pot 288. I call 36, making pot 324. I'd have 89 - 36 = 53 left, plus win 324, total 377 chips. That's a big boost.\n\nBut if I'm likely beat, I should fold. Let's think about my hand strength: I called flop and turn with ace-high flush draw. Flop was 5c 9d 2c - I had ace-high flush draw with two overcards (ace and jack). Good call. Turn was 5s, pairing board, I called with flush draw and maybe pair if I hit ace. River brought Ah, giving me top pair. So my hand improved.\n\nOpponent's line: 3-bet preflop, bet flop, bet turn, bet river. That's consistent with strong hand: overpair, maybe top pair good kicker, maybe set. The river ace might have improved them if they have AX. But they might also be betting for value with worse aces like AT, A9, maybe A2. But would they 3-bet those preflop? Possibly A9s, A2s. But A9s would have two pair now (aces and nines). A2s would have two pair (aces and deuces). Both beat my AJ.\n\nGiven the pot odds (7:1), I only need 12.5% equity. Even if I'm behind, I might"

Preflop: I raised to 20 (so 20 chips). Then opponent raised to 32, I called 12 more, so total preflop: 32 chips. That leaves 57 chips. Flop: opponent bet 36, I called 36, leaving 21 chips. Turn: opponent bet 36, but I only have 21 left? Actually I have 21 after flop call, but opponent bet 36, I can only call 21 (all-in). But description says \"turn: Seat 3 call 36\". That suggests I had 36 to call. Possibly my stack was larger at start of hand? Let me check: \"Your Stack: 89 chips (11.1 BB)\" at river stage. But maybe I had more earlier? The hand history might show cumulative. Let me think: At river, I have 89 chips. Pot is 252. Opponent bet 36. So I have 89 chips behind. That means I haven't put all my chips in yet. So my earlier calculation is wrong.\n\nLet me reconstruct: Starting stack 89. Preflop: I raise to 20 (put 20 in). Opponent raises to 32 (I need to add 12 to match). So I call 12 more, total invested 32. Stack now 57. Flop: opponent bets 36, I call 36. Stack now 21. Turn: opponent bets 36, but I only have 21, so I call 21 all-in? But description says \"turn: Seat 3 call 36\". That might be a mistake, or maybe I had more chips. Actually maybe my stack at start of hand was larger than 89? The 89 is current stack at river. That means I've already put in chips, but still have 89 left. So starting stack must have been larger. Let's calculate backwards: At river I have 89. I need to call 36. If I call, I'll have 53 left. So I've already put in (starting stack - 89). But we don't know starting stack. However, the pot is 252 chips. That includes all bets so far. Let's calculate total pot: Preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, I raised to 20, opponent raised to 32, I called 12. So preflop pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + my 20 + opponent's 32? Actually opponent's raise to 32 includes his SB of 4? Let's not get bogged down.\n\nBetter to focus on decision: I have top pair with ace kicker, board paired fives. Opponent has been betting all streets: preflop 3-bet, flop bet, turn bet, river bet. This looks like a strong hand. Could",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this river decision. I have Ac Jc, board: 5c 9d 2c 5s Ah. I have top pair with ace and jack kicker. The board paired fives, so there's a possible full house if opponent has a five. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has been betting consistently: preflop 3-bet, flop bet, turn bet, river bet. This line is strong.\n\nFrom opponent history: I see they've shown down various hands: Ad 5d (pair of fives with ace kicker), Js Qc (jack high), 3h 4h (straight draw), Kd 6s (pair of sixes), Td 7d (ten high). They've raised preflop multiple times. They tend to check rivers rather than bet. In 7 river actions, all were check or fold, no bets. This is their first river bet observed. That suggests this river bet is strong.\n\nPot is 252 chips, I need to call 36. That's pot odds of 252:36 or 7:1. I need about 12.5% equity to call. I have top pair with jack kicker. What can they have? They 3-bet preflop, so range includes: strong aces (AK, AQ, maybe AJ, AT), pairs (TT+, maybe 99, 88), suited connectors maybe. They bet flop on 5c 9d 2c board. That's a dry board except for flush draw. They bet turn when 5s pairs the board. Now river brings Ah, giving me top pair. But this ace might improve their hand if they have AX. They could have AK, AQ, maybe AT. They could have a five (A5, 55, maybe suited connectors with five). 55 is unlikely as only one combo left (since two fives on board). A5 suited possible. They could have an overpair like TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA. AA unlikely as I have an ace. KK possible.\n\nMy hand: Aces with jack kicker. If they have AK or AQ, I'm beat. If they have AT, I win. If they have a five, I'm beat. If they have an overpair like KK, QQ, JJ, I'm beat (JJ ties). If they have a bluff with missed flush draw or straight draw, I win.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to check rivers, this bet looks value-heavy. They're likely betting for value with a hand that beats top pair. They might have AK, AQ, or a five. They could also have a slow-played set of nines or deuces, but those would likely check river after pairing board? Actually set of nines would be full house now (9s full of fives). That's possible.\n\nMy stack is 89 chips (11.1 BB). Tournament considerations: I'm short-stacked. Folding leaves me with 89 chips (11.1 BB). Calling and losing leaves me with 53 chips (6.6 BB). Calling and winning gives me 89 + 252 = 341 chips? Actually if I call 36 and win, I get the pot of 252 + opponent's river bet 36 + my call 36 = 324 total pot? Wait, pot is 252 before river bet. Opponent bet 36, making pot 288. I call 36, making pot 324. I'd have 89 - 36 = 53 left, plus win 324, total 377 chips. That's a big boost.\n\nBut if I'm likely beat, I should fold. Let's think about my hand strength: I called flop and turn with ace-high flush draw. Flop was 5c 9d 2c - I had ace-high flush draw with two overcards (ace and jack). Good call. Turn was 5s, pairing board, I called with flush draw and maybe pair if I hit ace. River brought Ah, giving me top pair. So my hand improved.\n\nOpponent's line: 3-bet preflop, bet flop, bet turn, bet river. That's consistent with strong hand: overpair, maybe top pair good kicker, maybe set. The river ace might have improved them if they have AX. But they might also be betting for value with worse aces like AT, A9, maybe A2. But would they 3-bet those preflop? Possibly A9s, A2s. But A9s would have two pair now (aces and nines). A2s would have two pair (aces and deuces). Both beat my AJ.\n\nGiven the pot odds (7:1), I only need 12.5% equity. Even if I'm behind, I might",

          "reasoning_content": "I see opponent has raised preflop multiple times, including raises of various sizes. They've shown down Ad5d (ace-five suited) which is relevant because that hand would have two pair on this board (aces and fives). They also showed JsQc (jack-queen offsuit), 3h4h (suited connector), Kd6s (king-six off), Td7d (ten-seven suited). So they play a wide range.\n\nIn this hand, they 3-bet preflop (raised after my raise). That's a stronger play. Their river bet is unusual - they've checked all 7 previous rivers. This suggests this river bet is strong, likely value.\n\nMy hand: AJ suited, top pair with jack kicker. Board: 5c 9d 2c 5s Ah. The ace on river gives me top pair, but also could improve their hand if they have AX. They could have AK, AQ, AJ (split), AT, A9, A5, A2. A5 and A2 would be two pair. A9 would be two pair (aces and nines). AT would be worse ace. They could also have an overpair like KK, QQ, JJ (JJ splits), TT. They could have a five (like 55 for quads, but unlikely). They could have a set of nines or deuces that turned into full house.\n\nGiven their shown Ad5d previously, they might play A5 suited again. That would be two pair (aces and fives) which beats my AJ.\n\nPot odds: 252 pot, need to call 36. That's 7:1 odds, needing only ~12.5% equity. Even if I'm behind, I might have some outs if they're bluffing or have worse ace. But what worse ace would they have? AT, A8, A7, etc. Would they 3-bet those preflop? Possibly AT suited. But they might also have missed flush draw (clubs) and be bluffing. I have Ac, so they can't have nut flush draw with Ac. They could have KcQc, KcTc, QcJc, etc. But those missed. Would they triple barrel bluff? Possible but less likely given their river checking tendency.\n\nMy stack is short (11.1 BB). If I fold, I have 11.1 BB left, still playable. If I call and lose, I have 6.6 BB, very short. If I call and win, I have ~47 BB (377 chips / 8 = 47 BB). That's a huge boost.\n\nI need to estimate my equity. Let's think about their range: 3-bet preflop from SB vs my BTN raise. Their range could be: strong aces (AK, AQ, AJ, AT suited), pairs (TT+, maybe 99, 88), suited connectors (maybe). They bet flop on 5c9d2c board. That's a c-bet with many hands. They bet turn when board pairs 5s. That's a double barrel. Could be for value or as bluff. River ace comes, they bet. This ace improves many of their value hands (AX). It also improves my hand. If they were bluffing with missed draw, they might give up. But they bet. So likely value.\n\nWhat value hands do they bet that I beat? AT (ace-ten) is possible. A8, A7, etc. Would they 3-bet those? Maybe not. AJ splits. So I only beat AT and worse aces, and bluffs. I lose to AK, AQ, A5, A2, A9, any five, overpairs, sets.\n\nGiven pot odds of 7:1, I need 12.5% equity. I think I have more than that. There's chance they have AT or worse ace, or bluff. Also they might have KK/QQ and think they're value betting, but actually I have ace so they're beat. But would they bet KK on this river after ace comes? Possibly not. They might check. But they bet, so they likely have an ace or better.\n\nI'll call. The pot odds justify it. Even if I'm behind, I have some chance. And tournament life: if I fold, I'm very short anyway. If I win, I'm in great shape.\n\nAction: call. No raise because I'm short and raising would be all-in, but no reason to raise with marginal hand.\n\nLet me output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I see opponent's river actions: all checks or folds, no bets. This is their first river bet. That suggests strength. Their showdown hands include Ad5d (pair of fives with ace kicker), JsQc (jack high), 3h4h (straight draw), Kd6s (pair of sixes), Td7d (ten high). They've shown some speculative hands.\n\nI need to decide. My hand: AcJc, top pair with jack kicker. Board: 5c 9d 2c 5s Ah. I have aces with jack kicker. Opponent's range: They 3-bet preflop. From their shown hands, they 3-bet with Ad5d (suited ace with five). So they might 3-bet with A5s. They also showed JsQc (off-suit broadway) which they might not have 3-bet. They showed 3h4h (suited connectors) which they might not have 3-bet. So their 3-betting range includes strong aces, pairs, maybe suited aces with low kicker.\n\nGiven the board, what hands make sense? They bet flop on 5c9d2c. That's a c-bet on a dry board. They bet turn when board pairs fives (5s). That could be continued betting with overpair, set, or maybe ace-high with flush draw. River brings Ah. This improves my hand to top pair, but also improves any ace in their hand. If they have AK, AQ, they now have top pair better kicker. If they have A5, they now have a full house (aces full of fives). If they have 55, they have quads. If they have 99 or 22, they have full house. If they have an overpair like KK, QQ, JJ, they're still ahead.\n\nThey're betting river after I called flop and turn. I called flop with flush draw, called turn with flush draw or maybe pair. My line looks like a flush draw that missed. They might be value betting with a hand that beats ace-high, thinking I have a missed flush draw. They could be bluffing with a missed draw themselves, but given their river history of checking, this bet seems like value.\n\nPot odds: pot is 252, need to call 36. That's 7:1 odds, requiring ~12.5% equity. Even if I'm behind, I might have some outs if they're bluffing. But what bluffs do they have? Missed flush draws? Board has two clubs, but I have AcJc, so they can't have nut flush draw. They could have KcQc, KcTc, QcTc, etc. But would they 3-bet those preflop? Possibly. Would they bet river as bluff? Maybe, but their river betting tendency suggests they don't bluff rivers often.\n\nMy stack is 89 chips (11.1 BB). If I fold, I have 89 chips, still playable but short. If I call and lose, I have 53 chips (6.6 BB), very short but not dead. If I call and win, I have ~377 chips, a huge boost.\n\nGiven the pot odds, I should call with any reasonable chance. Even if I'm behind 85% of the time, I still have pot odds. Let's estimate my equity against their range. Their value range: AK, AQ, A5s, 99, 22, 55, KK, QQ, JJ, maybe ATs. My hand beats AT, A9, A2, bluffs. They might also value bet worse aces like A9s (two pair), A2s (two pair), which beat me. So I'm only beating AT and bluffs. That's a narrow range.\n\nBut they might also have missed draws like KcQc, QcJc, JcTc, etc. Those are possible. Would they bet those on river? Possibly as bluff.\n\nI think with 7:1 odds, I should call. Even if I'm only ahead 20% of the time, it's profitable. Let's call.\n\nI cannot raise because minimum raise to 72, but I only have 89 total, so I could raise all-in to 89. But raising seems bad because if they have a strong hand, they'll call, and if they're bluffing, they'll fold. Better to just call.\n\nDecision: call.",

However, being out of position reduces my effective equity.\n\nTournament considerations: With 10.1 BB, I'm in push-or-fold territory. I could consider a shove here, but that would be 81 total (raising to 81 from current 8 invested). The opponent would need to call 65 more into a pot of 105 (24 + 81), giving them ~1.6:1 odds, needing ~38% equity. They might fold a lot of their raising range.\n\nBut looking at opponent tendencies: they've shown willingness to raise with marginal hands and have folded to aggression recently. They have a big stack (344 chips vs my 81).\n\nLet me check if they've faced shoves before."

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with 8h7h, a suited connector but not a great hand. My stack is 81 chips (10.1 BB). The opponent in seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 16 total (a min-raise from SB). The pot is 24 chips (4 SB + 8 BB + 12 raise). I need to call 8 more chips to continue.\n\nFrom the opponent data, I see:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised preflop frequently (9 times in the data shown)\n- Their raises vary in size: 6, 8, 12, 8, 12, 40, 8, 12, 16 chips\n- They've shown down hands like 9d8d, 9s8c, 9s8s, Kc9c - mostly marginal hands\n- They've folded preflop several times recently (hands 42, 43, 47, 48, 49)\n\nMy own stack is short (10.1 BB). 8h7s is a suited connector that plays well postflop, but I'm out of position. The pot odds: I need to call 8 to win 32 (24 current pot + 8 my call), so I need ~25% equity.\n\nAgainst a reasonable raising range from SB (maybe 30-40% of hands), 8h7h has about 35-40% equity heads-up. However, being out of position reduces my effective equity.\n\nTournament considerations: With 10.1 BB, I'm in push-or-fold territory. I could consider a shove here, but that would be 81 total (raising to 81 from current 8 invested). The opponent would need to call 65 more into a pot of 105 (24 + 81), giving them ~1.6:1 odds, needing ~38% equity. They might fold a lot of their raising range.\n\nBut looking at opponent tendencies: they've shown willingness to raise with marginal hands and have folded to aggression recently. They have a big stack (344 chips vs my 81).\n\nLet me check if they've faced shoves before.",

Shove applies pressure with fold equity; if called, suited connector has reasonable 35-40% equity against many hands. Better to take initiative than call out of position.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with JSON format. Let me think about this decision:\n\n- Hand: 8h7h (suited connector)\n- Stack: 81 chips (10.1 BB)\n- Position: BB (out of position vs SB raiser)\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 Thinking raised to 16 (min-raise from SB)\n- Pot odds: Need to call 8 to win 32, need 25% equity\n- Tournament: Short stack, push-or-fold territory\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: Conservative, preserve stack for better spot\n2. Call: See flop cheaply with suited connector, but out of position\n3. Raise/shove: Apply pressure, opponent might fold many hands\n\nWith 10.1 BB, standard play is push-or-fold. 8h7s has decent equity against a wide SB raising range. If I shove to 81, opponent needs to call 65 into 105, getting 1.6:1 odds. They might fold many hands in their raising range.\n\nLooking at opponent's recent history: they've folded preflop several times recently (hands 42, 43, 47, 48, 49). This suggests they might be tightening up or cautious. They might fold to a shove.\n\nHowever, 8h7s is not a premium shoving hand from BB vs SB. Typically with 10 BB, I'd shove wider from SB vs BB, but from BB vs SB, I need a stronger hand. But given opponent's recent folding tendencies and my stack size, a shove might be profitable.\n\nLet me consider pot odds: If I call 8 (10% of my stack) to see flop, I'd have 73 left (9.1 BB). That's still playable. But out of position with 8h7h, I'll often miss flop or have marginal hands.\n\nBetter to shove or fold. With suited connector and fold equity, shove seems reasonable. But if called, I'm likely behind but have decent equity against many hands.\n\nI'll go for a shove.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My position: SB (small blind)\n- My cards: 9\u2666 Q\u2665 (off-suit, mediocre hand)\n- My stack: 101 chips (12.6 BB)\n- Pot: 36 chips\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 Thinking in Seat 1 (UTG) raised to 24 (3x BB)\n- Amount to call: 20 chips\n- Minimum raise to: 40 chips\n\n**Stack Analysis:**\n- I have 101 chips total\n- I've already put 4 chips as SB\n- Calling 20 would put 24 total in the pot, leaving me with 77 chips (9.6 BB)\n- If I raise to 40 total (36 more), I'd have 61 chips left (7.6 BB)\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- Q9o is a weak hand, especially from SB position\n- Against a UTG raise, this hand is typically a fold\n- Q9o doesn't play well postflop, especially with a short stack\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall, Kimi-K2 Thinking has:\n- Folded preflop 4 times (hands 47-50)\n- Called once preflop (hand 45)\n- Raised once preflop (hand 50, raised to 16 from UTG)\n- Bet once on river (hand 44)\n\nIn hand 50 (just last hand), they raised to 16 from UTG and then folded. So they're showing some aggression but also folding to resistance.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 36 chips\n- To call: 20 chips\n- Pot odds: 20/(36+20) = 20/56 = 35.7%\n- Need ~36% equity to call\n\n**Equity Considerations:**\n- Q9o vs UTG raising range (likely top 20-25% of hands) has ~30-35% equity\n- With implied odds, but I'm short-stacked\n- Position is bad (SB, will act first postflop)\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 12.6 BB, which is getting short but not desperate\n- Folding leaves me with 97 chips (12.1 BB) - still playable\n- Calling commits 20% of my stack with a weak hand\n- Raising would be committing 36% of my stack\n\n**Better Options:**\n1. Fold - Preserve stack for better spots\n2. Call - Questionable with weak hand and bad position  \n3. Raise - Too aggressive with Q9o, would be a bluff\n\nGiven my stack size, position, and hand strength, folding is the correct play. I should wait for a better spot, especially since I'm not in immediate danger with 12 BB. The pot odds are close but not favorable enough given the positional disadvantage and hand weakness.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q9o is too weak against UTG raise from SB position. With 12.6 BB stack, better to preserve chips for stronger spots. Pot odds (35.7%) borderline but position disadvantage and hand weakness make fold correct.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with Qh Ah (AQ suited). My stack is 101 chips (12.6 BB). Blinds are 4/8. The small blind (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) posted 4, and the big blind (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted 8. I need to call 8 to see the flop. Minimum raise is to 16 total.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB): Has been raising preflop recently - raised to 16 in hand 50 and 24 in hand 51. Seems active.\n2. MiniMax-M2 (SB): Raised to 32 preflop in hand 49, called 16 preflop in hand 51. Also active.\n\nMy hand AQ suited is strong, especially from the button. With 12.6 BB stack, I'm getting short. This is a good spot to accumulate chips or go all-in.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 8 into pot of 12 (4 SB + 8 BB). That's 8 to win 12, or 1:1.5 odds. With AQ suited, I have good equity.\n\nGiven my short stack and strong hand, I should consider raising or even going all-in. If I raise to 16 (minimum), that's only 8 more than calling. But with my stack size, I might want to go all-in to maximize fold equity and avoid playing postflop with a short stack.\n\nLet me check: If I go all-in for 101, that's a big raise. The pot would be 12 + 101 = 113 if called by both. If only one calls, pot would be around 109.\n\nActually, thinking about tournament considerations: I have 12.6 BB, which is getting into push/fold territory. AQ suited is definitely a hand worth shoving from the button. The blinds are 4/8, so my 101 chips is significant.\n\nIf I just call 8, I'll have 93 left going to flop with pot of 20. That's awkward stack-to-pot ratio.\n\nBetter to raise. Question is how much. Minimum raise to 16 leaves me with 85 behind in pot of 28. Still awkward.\n\nAll-in seems best with AQ suited given stack size. Let me check if there are any other factors.\n\nWait, I should consider that the SB (MiniMax-M2) might call or raise. They have 417 chips. BB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 392 chips. Both have me covered.\n\nFrom my hand history, I've been playing aggressively when short-stacked (hand 50 I raised to 81 with 87 suited from BB and won).\n\nGiven everything, I think all-in is the best play. AQ suited is too strong to fold, and with my stack size, I want to maximize fold equity and avoid tricky postflop play.\n\nLet me structure the response.",

Both opponents (Kimi-K2 Thinking in BB with 392 chips and MiniMax-M2 in SB with 417 chips) have folded many hands preflop based on my search. \n\nLooking at my recent hands: I won hand #50 with 87 suited by raising to 81 chips from BB, which was an all-in. I have a win rate of 17.6% over 51 hands.\n\nWith AQs on the button and only 12.6 BB, this is a clear push-or-fold situation. AQs is a premium hand, especially in late position. Given my short stack and the fact that both opponents have been folding frequently preflop, going all-in here makes sense. The pot already has 12 chips (blinds), and if I can take it down uncontested, that's a 12% increase to my stack.\n\nIf I get called, AQs has good equity against most calling ranges. The BB has a big stack and might call wider, but my hand is strong enough to take the risk. Folding would be too tight given my stack size.\n\nI should go all-in to 101 chips.

The opponent in seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 16 total from the SB. The pot is 24 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 12 more). I need to call 8 more chips to continue.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: From the recall data, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising preflop quite frequently with various bet sizes (8, 12, 16, 24, 40). This suggests a wide raising range from the SB, likely trying to steal the blinds. In hand #44, they raised to 16 from SB and then checked through flop and turn before betting river. In hand #50, they raised to 16 from SB and folded to a 3-bet. In hand #51, they raised to 24 from SB and then bet flop and turn aggressively.\n\nMy hand: 9d8d is a suited connector that plays well multi-way but heads-up against a SB raise. As BB vs SB raise, I'm getting good pot odds: need to call 8 to win 24, so 1:3 pot odds (25% equity needed). 9d8d has ~40% equity against a typical SB stealing range.\n\nStack considerations: I have 105 chips (13.1 BB). Calling 8 chips leaves me with 97 chips (12.1 BB). This is still playable but getting short. Folding leaves me with 105 chips. Raising could be an option but with my stack size, a raise would be committing.\n\nTournament situation: I need to accumulate chips but also preserve my stack. The opponent has 376 chips (47 BB), so they have me covered.\n\nGiven the pot odds (25% equity needed) and my hand's equity against a likely wide SB stealing range (~40%), calling seems mathematically correct. However, position is bad - I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nAlternative: 3-bet shoving could be considered as a bluff since opponent might fold a wide range, but with only 13 BB effective, a shove would be ~12 BB over a 2 BB raise. That's quite large and might only get called by stronger hands.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: In hand #50 (just 3 hands ago), I had 8h7h in BB vs SB raise and I 3-bet shoved for 81 chips (10 BB) and won without showdown. So opponent has seen me 3-bet shove from BB recently.\n\nDecision: I think calling is best. Good pot odds, decent hand that can make strong draws or two pair. If I hit a good flop, I can continue. If not, I can fold. The implied odds are decent if I hit a strong hand.\n\nLet me call."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with 9d8d (suited connector, decent speculative hand). My stack is 105 chips (13.1 BB). The opponent in seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 16 total from the SB. The pot is 24 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 12 more). I need to call 8 more chips to continue.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: From the recall data, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising preflop quite frequently with various bet sizes (8, 12, 16, 24, 40). This suggests a wide raising range from the SB, likely trying to steal the blinds. In hand #44, they raised to 16 from SB and then checked through flop and turn before betting river. In hand #50, they raised to 16 from SB and folded to a 3-bet. In hand #51, they raised to 24 from SB and then bet flop and turn aggressively.\n\nMy hand: 9d8d is a suited connector that plays well multi-way but heads-up against a SB raise. As BB vs SB raise, I'm getting good pot odds: need to call 8 to win 24, so 1:3 pot odds (25% equity needed). 9d8d has ~40% equity against a typical SB stealing range.\n\nStack considerations: I have 105 chips (13.1 BB). Calling 8 chips leaves me with 97 chips (12.1 BB). This is still playable but getting short. Folding leaves me with 105 chips. Raising could be an option but with my stack size, a raise would be committing.\n\nTournament situation: I need to accumulate chips but also preserve my stack. The opponent has 376 chips (47 BB), so they have me covered.\n\nGiven the pot odds (25% equity needed) and my hand's equity against a likely wide SB stealing range (~40%), calling seems mathematically correct. However, position is bad - I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nAlternative: 3-bet shoving could be considered as a bluff since opponent might fold a wide range, but with only 13 BB effective, a shove would be ~12 BB over a 2 BB raise. That's quite large and might only get called by stronger hands.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: In hand #50 (just 3 hands ago), I had 8h7h in BB vs SB raise and I 3-bet shoved for 81 chips (10 BB) and won without showdown. So opponent has seen me 3-bet shove from BB recently.\n\nDecision: I think calling is best. Good pot odds, decent hand that can make strong draws or two pair. If I hit a good flop, I can continue. If not, I can fold. The implied odds are decent if I hit a strong hand.\n\nLet me call.",

Opponent raised to 16 from SB (2 BB raise). I need to call 8 more chips. Pot is 24 chips. Pot odds: 8 to win 24 = 1:3 = 25% equity needed.\n\n9d8s suited has decent equity against a SB stealing range. Against a typical SB opening range (say 40% of hands), 9d8d has about 41% equity. So calling is +EV.\n\nPosition: I'll be out of position, which is a disadvantage, but with my stack size, I'll be playing fit-or-fold postflop.\n\nStack preservation: I have 105 chips, calling leaves 97 (12.1 BB). Still playable.\n\nAlternative: Raise. Minimum raise to 24 total (8 more than current bet of 16). But raising commits more chips and I'd be out of position. Or I could shove for 105 total, but that's a huge overbet (12 BB over a 2 BB raise). Might get folds from weak parts of opponent's range, but might only get called by better hands.\n\nGiven opponent's tendencies: They raise frequently from SB, but also fold to 3-bets sometimes (hand #50). However, my recent 3-bet shove from BB might make them more likely to call with a wider range now.\n\nI think calling is the most balanced approach. Good pot odds, decent hand, preserve some chips.\n\nSo action: call. No raise_to needed.\n\nResponse format: JSON with action, raise_to (null), reasoning.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 9d 8d - suited connectors, but not hitting this flop (4d Jc Kc). I have a backdoor flush draw with diamonds, but the board has two clubs which could be scary. I have no pair, no straight draw yet (need 6-7 or T-Q for straight).\n\n2. **Board**: 4d Jc Kc - This is a very dry flop that likely hits the preflop raiser's range (Kx, JJ, maybe 44, AK, KQ, KJ, etc.)\n\n3. **Opponent action**: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised preflop to 16, then bet 48 on the flop into a pot of 80. That's a 60% pot bet, which is strong. Looking at the opponent history, they raised preflop in hand 50 and 51, then bet flop in hand 51. They seem to be aggressive.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 97 chips total (12.1 BB). I already have 8 in from BB, plus 8 call preflop = 16 invested. To call 48 more, I'd be putting in half my stack (49 total invested). The pot would be 128 after my call.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 48 to win 128 (80 current pot + 48 opponent bet). That's 48/176 = 27% pot odds. I need about 27% equity to call.\n\n6. **Equity analysis**: With 9d8d on 4dJcKc, I have:\n   - No pair\n   - Backdoor flush draw (runner-runner diamonds) ~4%\n   - Backdoor straight draw (need 6-7 or T-Q) ~4%\n   - Total equity against a strong range (top pair, overpair, sets) is probably around 15-20%\n\n7. **Tournament situation**: I'm very short stacked (12.1 BB). If I fold, I have 97 chips left. If I call and lose, I'm down to 49 chips (6 BB). That's critically short.\n\n8. **Implied odds**: Even if I hit a miracle turn, I don't have much stack left to extract value. And the board has two clubs, so flush draws are possible.\n\nGiven my equity is below the required pot odds, my short stack situation, and the fact that I'm likely behind to a strong range from the preflop raiser, folding is the correct play. I should wait for a better spot with my short stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9d8d missed flop (4dJcKc) with only backdoor draws.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 8h Th, with 93 chips (11.6 BB). I posted the small blind of 4 chips, and it's folded to me. The big blind is MiniMax-M2 with 409 chips. I need to call 4 more chips to complete the blind, or I can raise, or fold.\n\nMy hand: 8h Th is a marginal hand. It's suited, which gives it some potential for flushes, but it's low connected. I have position (button) which is good.\n\nMy stack: 93 chips (11.6 BB) is short-stacked. In tournament poker with short stacks, we often need to be aggressive and look for spots to accumulate chips or go all-in preflop.\n\nThe opponent: MiniMax-M2 has folded the last 3 hands preflop (hands 51, 52, 53). Looking at the opponent actions: they folded hand 50 preflop, called a raise in hand 51, then folded on turn, then folded hands 52 and 53 preflop. They seem somewhat tight recently.\n\nPot odds: The pot is 12 chips (4 SB + 8 BB). I need to call 4 chips to win 12, so I'm getting 3:1 pot odds. That's excellent odds.\n\nWith my short stack and good pot odds, folding seems too tight. Calling is an option, but raising might be better to take initiative.\n\nIf I raise, minimum raise is to 16 total (I already have 4 in, so need to add 12 more). My stack is 93, so I could raise to various amounts. Given my stack size, a standard raise would be 2.5-3x BB = 20-24 total. Or I could go all-in for 93.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy with short stack: When under 15 BB, we often want to shove or fold from late positions. With 11.6 BB on the button against one opponent (BB), this is a prime shove spot with many hands.\n\nMy hand 8h Th is not premium, but it's decent for a short-stack shove from the button. The BB has been folding recently, so they might fold to aggression. Even if they call, my hand has decent equity against a random calling range.\n\nLet me think about ranges: If I shove 93 chips (11.6 BB), the BB needs to call 85 more chips (93 total - 8 already in) to win 106 pot (93 + 12 + 1?). Actually: pot would be 12 (current) + 89 (my additional) = 101 total. BB needs to call 85 to win 101, getting about 1.2:1 odds, needing ~45% equity.\n\nThe BB's calling range against an 11.6 BB shove from button might be around top 20-30% of hands. Against that range, 8h Th has about 35-40% equity. Not great, but with fold equity, it could be profitable.\n\nAlternative: I could min-raise to 16, but then I'm committing 16/93 = 17% of my stack, and likely facing a shove from BB if they want to play. That puts me in a tough spot.\n\nBetter to either fold or shove. With 3:1 pot odds to call, folding seems too weak. Shoving has fold equity.\n\nLet me check my recent hands: I've been fairly aggressive recently, winning hands 47, 50, 52 with raises. My image might be aggressive.\n\nGiven all factors: short stack, button position, good pot odds, opponent showing recent folds, and need to accumulate chips, I think shoving is the best play.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 93,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Short stack (11.6 BB) on button with suited connector. Shoving maximizes fold equity against BB who has folded last 3 hands preflop. With 3:1 pot odds to call, folding is too tight.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n- I have only 4 chips left (0.5 BB)\n- I'm on the button with 8h Th\n- The pot is 186 chips\n- The board is 6s 3s Jd\n- I have 0 to call, legal actions are fold or check\n- I went all-in preflop with 4 chips (my entire stack)\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called\n\nSo essentially, I'm all-in preflop with 8h Th. The flop came 6s 3s Jd. My hand is 8-high with no draws (no flush draw, no straight draw). I have backdoor straight possibilities if turn and river are 9 and Q, but that's very unlikely.\n\nGiven that I'm already all-in, I can't make any more decisions. The hand will continue to showdown automatically since I have no more chips to bet. I should just check (since amount to call is 0).\n\nActually wait, I need to think: Since I'm all-in with only 4 chips, and the pot is 186, I have no further action. The flop betting will continue between the other players if there were any, but Seat 4 already called preflop and now we're on the flop. Since I'm all-in, I can only check/fold, but checking is the only logical option since folding would forfeit my chance to win the pot.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: The pot is 186 chips. I contributed 4 chips. Seat 4 contributed the rest (182 chips). Since I'm all-in, the main pot is 8 chips (my 4 + opponent's 4) and there might be a side pot if Seat 4 bets more, but I can't win the side pot anyway.\n\nI should check and see what happens. This is a tournament situation and I'm essentially on life support with 0.5 BB. I need to hope my 8h Th can improve.\n\nLet me check: 8h Th on 6s 3s Jd gives me:\n- No pair\n- No flush draw (hearts vs spades board)\n- Backdoor straight: need 9 and Q (8-9-T-J-Q)\n- Very weak hand\n\nBut since I'm all-in, I have no choice but to check and hope for the best.",

Wait, that seems impossible with only 4 chips total. Let me check the actions again:\n\n- Preflop: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 4\n- Preflop: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) post_bb 8  \n- Preflop: Seat 1 fold\n- Preflop: Seat 3 raise 93\n- Preflop: Seat 4 call 85\n\nThis doesn't make sense mathematically. I had 4 chips total. After posting SB 4, I have 0 chips left. How can I raise to 93? This must be an error or some tournament situation where I have more chips than shown.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes: I have 4 chips, but the pot is 271 chips. That's huge. And I need to call 85 chips with only 4 chips. This is impossible unless there's something wrong with the chip counts.\n\nWait, maybe the \"Your Stack: 4 chips (0.5 BB)\" is a mistake? Or maybe this is a tournament where I have chips in play that aren't reflected in the stack display?\n\nLet me think: If I have only 4 chips, I couldn't have raised to 93 preflop. But the action shows I did. So either:\n1. The stack display is wrong\n2. There's some tournament mechanic I don't understand\n3. This is a bug\n\nGiven that I need to make a decision now: I have 8h Th on a 6s 3s Jd board. The pot is 271 chips. Seat 4 bet 85, and I need to call 85. But I only have 4 chips according to the display.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions: \"fold, call\" - I can call. But if I only have 4 chips, calling 85 is impossible. Unless I'm already all-in with my 4 chips?\n\nWait, I think I understand: I have 4 chips LEFT after posting SB. But I already committed those 4 chips as SB. So I have 0 chips. But then how did I raise to 93? \n\nActually, re-reading: \"preflop: Seat 3 raise 93\" - maybe this means I raised BY 93, not TO 93? But that would be even more impossible with 4 chips.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me check the pot size: 271 chips. That's consistent with: SB 4 + BB 8 + my raise 93 + opponent's call 85 = 190 chips preflop, plus flop bet 85 = 275 chips. Close enough.\n\nGiven the mathematical impossibility, I think the \"Your Stack: 4 chips\" display must be wrong. I must have more chips than that.\n\nLet me analyze the hand based on the actual situation: I have 8h Th, board is 6s 3s Jd. I raised preflop, opponent called. I checked flop, opponent bet 85 into 190 pot (about 45% pot).\n\nMy hand: 8h Th. I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 9 for 7-8-9-T-J straight). Also backdoor flush potential (hearts). Very weak hand.\n\nOpponent: MiniMax-M2 has 239 chips. From history, they seem reasonably tight - folded to my raises in hands 50, 52, 53. Called once in hand 51 with position.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 85 to win 271+85=356. That's about 24% pot odds. My equity: With gutshot (4 outs) + maybe some runner-runner hearts or pairs, maybe 15-20% equity at best. Not getting good direct odds.\n\nBut I raised preflop, so I have some fold equity if I shove? Actually, I can't raise - only legal actions are fold or call.\n\nGiven I have a very weak hand, poor pot odds, and opponent likely has at least a piece of this board (J or better), I should fold.\n\nBut wait - if I'm actually short-stacked (maybe I have less than 85 chips?), then calling might be a tournament desperation move. But the math still doesn't work.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll go with the logical poker decision: fold this weak hand on this flop.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Hand 8h Th on 6s 3s Jd flop has very little equity (gutshot draw only).

Wait, that seems impossible with only 4 chips total. Let me check the actions again:\n\n- Preflop: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 4\n- Preflop: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) post_bb 8  \n- Preflop: Seat 1 fold\n- Preflop: Seat 3 raise 93\n- Preflop: Seat 4 call 85\n\nThis doesn't make sense mathematically. I had 4 chips total. After posting SB 4, I have 0 chips left. How can I raise to 93? This must be an error or some tournament situation where I have more chips than shown.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes: I have 4 chips, but the pot is 271 chips. That's huge. And I need to call 85 chips with only 4 chips. This is impossible unless there's something wrong with the chip counts.\n\nWait, maybe the \"Your Stack: 4 chips (0.5 BB)\" is a mistake? Or maybe this is a tournament where I have chips in play that aren't reflected in the stack display?\n\nLet me think: If I have only 4 chips, I couldn't have raised to 93 preflop. But the action shows I did. So either:\n1. The stack display is wrong\n2. There's some tournament mechanic I don't understand\n3. This is a bug\n\nGiven that I need to make a decision now: I have 8h Th on a 6s 3s Jd board. The pot is 271 chips. Seat 4 bet 85, and I need to call 85. But I only have 4 chips according to the display.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions: \"fold, call\" - I can call. But if I only have 4 chips, calling 85 is impossible. Unless I'm already all-in with my 4 chips?\n\nWait, I think I understand: I have 4 chips LEFT after posting SB. But I already committed those 4 chips as SB. So I have 0 chips. But then how did I raise to 93? \n\nActually, re-reading: \"preflop: Seat 3 raise 93\" - maybe this means I raised BY 93, not TO 93? But that would be even more impossible with 4 chips.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me check the pot size: 271 chips. That's consistent with: SB 4 + BB 8 + my raise 93 + opponent's call 85 = 190 chips preflop, plus flop bet 85 = 275 chips. Close enough.\n\nGiven the mathematical impossibility, I think the \"Your Stack: 4 chips\" display must be wrong. I must have more chips than that.\n\nLet me analyze the hand based on the actual situation: I have 8h Th, board is 6s 3s Jd. I raised preflop, opponent called. I checked flop, opponent bet 85 into 190 pot (about 45% pot).\n\nMy hand: 8h Th. I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 9 for 7-8-9-T-J straight). Also backdoor flush potential (hearts). Very weak hand.\n\nOpponent: MiniMax-M2 has 239 chips. From history, they seem reasonably tight - folded to my raises in hands 50, 52, 53. Called once in hand 51 with position.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 85 to win 271+85=356. That's about 24% pot odds. My equity: With gutshot (4 outs) + maybe some runner-runner hearts or pairs, maybe 15-20% equity at best. Not getting good direct odds.\n\nBut I raised preflop, so I have some fold equity if I shove? Actually, I can't raise - only legal actions are fold or call.\n\nGiven I have a very weak hand, poor pot odds, and opponent likely has at least a piece of this board (J or better), I should fold.\n\nBut wait - if I'm actually short-stacked (maybe I have less than 85 chips?), then calling might be a tournament desperation move. But the math still doesn't work.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll go with the logical poker decision: fold this weak hand on this flop.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Hand 8h Th on 6s 3s Jd flop has very little equity (gutshot draw only).

I have 8h Th on 6s 3s Jd board. I raised preflop, opponent called. I checked flop, opponent bet 85 into 271 pot.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: MiniMax-M2 has folded to my raises in hands 50, 52, 53. Called once in hand 51. So they're somewhat tight. Their bet on this flop suggests they have something - likely at least a J, maybe a pair+draw, or a strong hand.\n\nMy hand: 8h Th. I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 9) - 4 outs. Also backdoor flush potential with hearts - but board has two spades, not hearts. So really just 4 clean outs to a straight.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 85 to win 271+85=356. That's 85/356 = 23.9% pot odds. My equity with 4 outs is about 8.5% on the turn, 16.5% by river if I see both cards. Not getting direct odds.\n\nBut I raised preflop, representing strength. However, opponent called and then bet into me on the flop, which suggests they're not afraid of my preflop raise.\n\nGiven my weak hand, poor pot odds, and opponent showing strength, folding is correct. Even if I'm short-stacked (the 4 chips display seems wrong), this isn't a good spot to gamble.\n\nWait, but if I'm actually very short-stacked (maybe I have less than 85 chips?), then pot odds might force me to call with any equity. But the math still doesn't add up - if I only have 4 chips, I can't call 85.\n\nActually, looking at the action sequence again: \"preflop: Seat 3 raise 93\" - maybe I raised all-in for my remaining 4 chips? But that would be \"raise 4\", not \"raise 93\". \n\nI think there's a display error.

The blinds are 4/8, so I have just half a big blind left. Seat 4 posted SB 4, Seat 1 posted BB 8. The pot is 12 chips. I need to call 8 chips, but I only have 4 chips total. Wait, looking at the situation: \"Your Stack: 4 chips (0.5 BB)\" and \"Amount to call: 8\". This means I'm effectively all-in if I call - I can only put in my remaining 4 chips.\n\nActually, I should think about this more carefully. The pot already has 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8). If I call, I put in my last 4 chips. Then Seat 4 (SB) would have to call an additional 4 to match? Or maybe they've already put in 4, so they need to put in 4 more to match the BB? Actually, Seat 4 posted SB 4, Seat 1 posted BB 8. The action is on me. I need to call 8, but I only have 4. In poker, when you don't have enough to call, you can go all-in for your remaining stack.\n\nBut wait, let me check the legal actions: only \"fold, call\" are available. No raise option. So I can either fold or call. If I call, I put in my remaining 4 chips (all-in). Then there would be a side pot if others continue.\n\nGiven my stack is only 4 chips (0.5 BB), and I have 8c 4s - one of the worst possible hands - this is a clear fold. Even though it's only 4 chips, it's still 50% of my stack. But actually, I have to consider tournament survival. With only 0.5 BB, I'm essentially dead anyway. I'll be forced all-in next hand from the small blind.\n\nActually, let me think: I'm on the button now. Next hand I'll be in the small blind position. The blinds are 4/8, so I'll have to post SB of 4 chips, which is my entire stack. So I'll be all-in next hand regardless. So I might as well take a chance now with any two cards.\n\nBut wait, I have position advantage here (button). However, my hand is terrible - 8c 4s is trash. But with only 0.5 BB, any two cards might be worth going all-in. The pot already has 12 chips. If I go all-in for 4 chips, I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (12:4). Actually, it's even better: if I call and both opponents fold, I win 12 chips. If they call, I have a chance to triple up.\n\nActually, let me check opponent tendencies. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) seems aggressive - has raised preflop multiple times. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has called some hands. But they might not call with weak hands given the tiny additional amount.\n\nActually, the math: I put in 4 to win 12, so I need only 25% equity to break even. Even 8c 4s has some equity against random hands.\n\nBut there's another consideration: I'm essentially forced all-in next hand anyway. So I should take this opportunity now rather than wait for the next hand where I'll be in worse position (SB).\n\nActually, next hand I'll be SB and have to post 4 chips blind. So I'll be all-in with a random hand from SB. Here I have button position and can see if anyone raises before me. Actually, action is on me now - no one has raised yet.\n\nWait, the action sequence: Seat 4 posted SB, Seat 1 posted BB, action is on me (button). So I act first preflop. If I fold, then action goes to Seat 4 (SB) who can complete or raise, then Seat 1 (BB).\n\nIf I go all-in now for 4 chips, Seat 4 would need to call 4 more (total 8), and Seat 1 would have his 8 already in. They might fold marginal hands.\n\nGiven my desperate situation with 0.5 BB, I should go all-in with any two cards. The hand is terrible, but the situation demands it.\n\nActually, let me check if there's any history of these opponents folding to small all-ins. Let me search."

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 8c 4s, which is an absolutely terrible hand. My stack is only 4 chips (0.5 BB). The blinds are 4/8, so I have just half a big blind left. Seat 4 posted SB 4, Seat 1 posted BB 8. The pot is 12 chips. I need to call 8 chips, but I only have 4 chips total. Wait, looking at the situation: \"Your Stack: 4 chips (0.5 BB)\" and \"Amount to call: 8\". This means I'm effectively all-in if I call - I can only put in my remaining 4 chips.\n\nActually, I should think about this more carefully. The pot already has 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8). If I call, I put in my last 4 chips. Then Seat 4 (SB) would have to call an additional 4 to match? Or maybe they've already put in 4, so they need to put in 4 more to match the BB? Actually, Seat 4 posted SB 4, Seat 1 posted BB 8. The action is on me. I need to call 8, but I only have 4. In poker, when you don't have enough to call, you can go all-in for your remaining stack.\n\nBut wait, let me check the legal actions: only \"fold, call\" are available. No raise option. So I can either fold or call. If I call, I put in my remaining 4 chips (all-in). Then there would be a side pot if others continue.\n\nGiven my stack is only 4 chips (0.5 BB), and I have 8c 4s - one of the worst possible hands - this is a clear fold. Even though it's only 4 chips, it's still 50% of my stack. But actually, I have to consider tournament survival. With only 0.5 BB, I'm essentially dead anyway. I'll be forced all-in next hand from the small blind.\n\nActually, let me think: I'm on the button now. Next hand I'll be in the small blind position. The blinds are 4/8, so I'll have to post SB of 4 chips, which is my entire stack. So I'll be all-in next hand regardless. So I might as well take a chance now with any two cards.\n\nBut wait, I have position advantage here (button). However, my hand is terrible - 8c 4s is trash. But with only 0.5 BB, any two cards might be worth going all-in. The pot already has 12 chips. If I go all-in for 4 chips, I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (12:4). Actually, it's even better: if I call and both opponents fold, I win 12 chips. If they call, I have a chance to triple up.\n\nActually, let me check opponent tendencies. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) seems aggressive - has raised preflop multiple times. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has called some hands. But they might not call with weak hands given the tiny additional amount.\n\nActually, the math: I put in 4 to win 12, so I need only 25% equity to break even. Even 8c 4s has some equity against random hands.\n\nBut there's another consideration: I'm essentially forced all-in next hand anyway. So I should take this opportunity now rather than wait for the next hand where I'll be in worse position (SB).\n\nActually, next hand I'll be SB and have to post 4 chips blind. So I'll be all-in with a random hand from SB. Here I have button position and can see if anyone raises before me. Actually, action is on me now - no one has raised yet.\n\nWait, the action sequence: Seat 4 posted SB, Seat 1 posted BB, action is on me (button). So I act first preflop. If I fold, then action goes to Seat 4 (SB) who can complete or raise, then Seat 1 (BB).\n\nIf I go all-in now for 4 chips, Seat 4 would need to call 4 more (total 8), and Seat 1 would have his 8 already in. They might fold marginal hands.\n\nGiven my desperate situation with 0.5 BB, I should go all-in with any two cards. The hand is terrible, but the situation demands it.\n\nActually, let me check if there's any history of these opponents folding to small all-ins. Let me search.",

The big blind still has to act after me.\n\nMy hand is weak: J4 offsuit is a very marginal hand. It's not suited, has low connectivity, and generally should be folded from the small blind against a raise. \n\nLooking at the opponent's actions: In hand #1, seat 2 raised to 8 preflop. That suggests they might be somewhat aggressive, but I only have one data point.\n\nThe pot is currently 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 5 chips to continue. That's about 2.5% of my stack. However, I'm out of position for the entire hand (small blind is the worst position postflop), and my hand is weak.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 5 to win 9, which gives me 1.8:1 odds (35.7% equity needed). J4o vs a typical raising range (say top 20% of hands) has about 30-35% equity. So mathematically it's close, but position makes this much worse.\n\nAlso, the big blind still has to act behind me, which could squeeze or call, making the pot multi-way with a weak hand.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, preserving my stack is important. With 98.5 BB, I have plenty of chips to wait for better spots. Folding weak hands from the small blind is standard.\n\nI should fold.

This suggests they're not overly tight and might defend their blind.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has folded preflop in both previous hands when facing action. This suggests they might be tight or cautious.\n\nMy hand 6s 3h is terrible - unsuited, low cards, no straight potential, no high card strength. Even on the button, this is a clear fold in most situations. The only reason to play would be if I thought I could steal the blinds, but with two opponents left and such a weak hand, it's not worth it.\n\nPosition is good (button), but the hand is just too weak. Even if I raise, I'll likely get called by at least one blind, and then I'll be playing a very weak hand out of position postflop against a likely better hand.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win 3 chips (1.5:1), but that's only if both blinds fold, which is unlikely. If I raise, I'd be putting in more chips with a very weak hand.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (98.5 BB), so no need to take unnecessary risks with trash hands.

At 98.5 BB deep, I have room to play some speculative hands, but UTG is the worst position to play from.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 has raised twice preflop (8 chips and 6 chips) and folded twice. Seems somewhat aggressive.\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has been more passive, calling and checking mostly.\n\nMy hand (8\u2666 T\u2666) is a suited connector, which has good implied odds when it hits, but from UTG with many players left to act, it's marginal. The pot is 3 chips, and I need to call 2 chips. That's 1:1.5 pot odds, which isn't great.\n\nGiven my position and the fact that there are 4 players left to act behind me (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, Kimi-K2 Thinking in SB, Kimi-K2 in BB), this hand is too weak to open from UTG. Even if I call, I could face a raise from later positions, and then I'd have to fold after putting in chips.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 197 chips (98.5 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands from early position.\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger hand in a better position. Fold is the correct play here.",

I'll have to act first on every street after the flop.\n\nStack: 195 chips (97.5 BB) - healthy stack.\n\nOpponents: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 4 from UTG+1 position. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called. Looking at MiniMax-M2's history: In hand #1 they folded T8o from BB. In hand #2 they called a raise with J4o from SB and bet flop. In hand #3 they called with 63o from BTN and bet flop and turn. In hand #4 they folded Q2o from CO. In hand #5 they folded T8s from UTG. So they seem to play somewhat loose but not overly aggressive.\n\nKimi-K2 Thinking called preflop. In hand #1 they called a raise preflop then folded to a 3-bet. They seem like a calling station.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win 11 chips (current pot) + 2 chips (my call) = 13 chips total. That's 2:11 pot odds, or about 1:5.5. I need about 15% equity to call. With 5h Jh, against a UTG+1 raise and a call, my equity is likely below 15% against reasonable ranges.\n\nImplied odds: If I hit a good flop (like two pair or better), I could win more chips. But with J5o, I'm mostly looking to hit two pair or trips. Straight potential is limited (need 4 cards). Flush potential is none since offsuit.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (97.5 BB). No need to take marginal spots from bad position.\n\nGiven all this, folding is correct. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors: The raise was small (min-raise to 4, which is 2BB). This could indicate a weaker hand, but still, my hand is too weak to continue.\n\nDecision: Fold."

But with J5o, I'm mostly looking to hit two pair or trips. Straight potential is limited (need 4 cards). Flush potential is none since offsuit.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (97.5 BB). No need to take marginal spots from bad position.\n\nGiven all this, folding is correct. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors: The raise was small (min-raise to 4, which is 2BB). This could indicate a weaker hand, but still, my hand is too weak to continue.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

The opponent in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8 from what appears to be UTG (since seats 1 and 2 folded). I'm on the button, so I have position.\n\nLooking at the opponent history: GPT-OSS-120B has folded 5 times, called twice, checked once. No raises observed. This is their first raise in 6 hands. That suggests they might have a decent hand.\n\nThe pot is 11 chips (SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 8). I need to call 7 chips to win 11, giving me pot odds of about 1.57:1 (11:7). That's about 39% equity needed.\n\nWith 2d 3d, my hand is very weak preflop. Even as a suited connector, it needs to hit a strong draw or made hand to continue. The implied odds could be decent if I hit a flush or straight draw, but I'm out of position relative to the raiser (they acted before me).\n\nHowever, I have position on the BB (MiniMax-M2) who hasn't acted yet. The BB has 189 chips and could call or raise.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history: They've shown some aggression - raised once, called raises, and bet on flops. They seem to be playing somewhat actively.\n\nGiven my weak hand, the fact that this is GPT-OSS-120B's first raise (suggesting strength), and the pot odds aren't great for such a weak hand, folding seems correct. The suited connector potential isn't enough to justify calling 7 chips (3.5 BB) with 2-3 suited.\n\nAlso, tournament considerations: I have 194 chips (97 BB), so I'm not short-stacked. No need to gamble with such a weak hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm on the BTN with 2d 3d. This is a suited connector, but it's a very weak hand - the lowest possible suited connector. The opponent in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8 from what appears to be UTG (since seats 1 and 2 folded). I'm on the button, so I have position.\n\nLooking at the opponent history: GPT-OSS-120B has folded 5 times, called twice, checked once. No raises observed. This is their first raise in 6 hands. That suggests they might have a decent hand.\n\nThe pot is 11 chips (SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 8). I need to call 7 chips to win 11, giving me pot odds of about 1.57:1 (11:7). That's about 39% equity needed.\n\nWith 2d 3d, my hand is very weak preflop. Even as a suited connector, it needs to hit a strong draw or made hand to continue. The implied odds could be decent if I hit a flush or straight draw, but I'm out of position relative to the raiser (they acted before me).\n\nHowever, I have position on the BB (MiniMax-M2) who hasn't acted yet. The BB has 189 chips and could call or raise.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history: They've shown some aggression - raised once, called raises, and bet on flops. They seem to be playing somewhat actively.\n\nGiven my weak hand, the fact that this is GPT-OSS-120B's first raise (suggesting strength), and the pot odds aren't great for such a weak hand, folding seems correct. The suited connector potential isn't enough to justify calling 7 chips (3.5 BB) with 2-3 suited.\n\nAlso, tournament considerations: I have 194 chips (97 BB), so I'm not short-stacked. No need to gamble with such a weak hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

MiniMax-M2 is in the small blind (Seat 4), and GPT-OSS-120B is in the big blind (Seat 5). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop, or I can raise to 4 minimum.\n\n**My stack**: 194 chips (97 BB) - healthy stack\n**Opponent stacks**: MiniMax-M2 (188), GPT-OSS-120B (195)\n\n**Hand strength**: KJo is a decent hand on the button. It's not premium but has good playability postflop. Being on the button gives me positional advantage.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from history**:\n- MiniMax-M2: Has raised preflop once (hand 6) from BB with Qs Ks (premium hand). Otherwise seems to play fairly tight. Folded to a raise from SB with 23s.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Has raised preflop once from SB with 23s (hand 7). Otherwise seems cautious.\n\n**My history**: I've folded every hand so far (7 hands). I need to start playing some hands to accumulate chips. Being too tight can be exploited.\n\n**Pot odds**: Pot is 3 chips, I need to call 2. Getting 1.5:1 odds preflop. Decent odds to see a flop with KJo.\n\n**Positional advantage**: Being on the button is huge. I get to act last on every postflop street.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 97 BB, I have plenty of room to maneuver. I should be looking to accumulate chips, not just preserve my stack.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight. KJo on button is definitely playable.\n2. **Call**: Reasonable. See a cheap flop with position.\n3. **Raise**: Also reasonable. Take initiative, potentially win blinds, or define hand.\n\nI think a raise is best here. KJo plays well as a raise from the button. I can put pressure on the blinds who likely have weak hands. A standard raise to 6-8 chips (3-4x) would be appropriate.\n\nLet me check what a typical raise size would be. Minimum raise is to 4 (2x BB). I should raise more like 6-8 to give myself better fold equity.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips (3x BB). This is a standard button raise."

MiniMax-M2 is in the small blind (Seat 4), and GPT-OSS-120B is in the big blind (Seat 5). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop, or I can raise to 4 minimum.\n\n**My stack**: 194 chips (97 BB) - healthy stack\n**Opponent stacks**: MiniMax-M2 (188), GPT-OSS-120B (195)\n\n**Hand strength**: KJo is a decent hand on the button. It's not premium but has good playability postflop. Being on the button gives me positional advantage.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from history**:\n- MiniMax-M2: Has raised preflop once (hand 6) from BB with Qs Ks (premium hand). Otherwise seems to play fairly tight. Folded to a raise from SB with 23s.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Has raised preflop once from SB with 23s (hand 7). Otherwise seems cautious.\n\n**My history**: I've folded every hand so far (7 hands). I need to start playing some hands to accumulate chips. Being too tight can be exploited.\n\n**Pot odds**: Pot is 3 chips, I need to call 2. Getting 1.5:1 odds preflop. Decent odds to see a flop with KJo.\n\n**Positional advantage**: Being on the button is huge. I get to act last on every postflop street.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 97 BB, I have plenty of room to maneuver. I should be looking to accumulate chips, not just preserve my stack.\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight. KJo on button is definitely playable.\n2. **Call**: Reasonable. See a cheap flop with position.\n3. **Raise**: Also reasonable. Take initiative, potentially win blinds, or define hand.\n\nI think a raise is best here. KJo plays well as a raise from the button. I can put pressure on the blinds who likely have weak hands. A standard raise to 6-8 chips (3-4x) would be appropriate.\n\nLet me check what a typical raise size would be. Minimum raise is to 4 (2x BB). I should raise more like 6-8 to give myself better fold equity.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips (3x BB). This is a standard button raise.",

Need to start accumulating chips. Stack is 194 (97 BB) - healthy.\n\nRaise is good to take initiative. Standard raise size is 3-4x BB, so 6-8 chips. Minimum raise is 4 (2x BB). I'll raise to 6 (3x BB).\n\nSo action: raise, raise_to: 6.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider the blinds. MiniMax-M2 in SB, GPT-OSS-120B in BB. They might defend with wide ranges. But position helps.\n\nActually, let me check if I should consider calling instead. Calling 2 with position is fine too. But raising gives me fold equity and initiative.\n\nI'll raise to 6.

Q6o is not a hand I should be playing from UTG, especially in a tournament.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding most hands, which is reasonable. I won one hand with KJo from BTN position with a raise. That's a much better hand and position.\n\nOpponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB): Has shown some aggression with a preflop raise in hand #5, and calls/bets postflop. Could be a thinking player.\n- MiniMax-M2: Has shown aggression postflop with bets on flop and turn in hand #6.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Raised preflop from SB in hand #7, otherwise folds.\n\nI'm first to act preflop with a terrible hand. The pot is 3 chips (SB + BB). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop. That's 1% of my stack (197 chips). While the immediate pot odds are okay (getting 1.5:1), the hand has very little potential. Q6o is dominated by any Q with better kicker, and even if I hit a Q, I'm vulnerable to better kickers. The 6 is basically useless.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 98.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands from early position. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots.\n\nAll factors point to folding:\n1. Terrible hand strength (Q6o)\n2. Worst position (UTG)\n3. Many players left to act who could raise\n4. Tournament - preserve stack\n5. Even if I call, I'm likely to face raises behind me\n\nI should fold."

UTG is the earliest position, so I have many players left to act behind me (MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB). Q6o is not a hand I should be playing from UTG, especially in a tournament.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding most hands, which is reasonable. I won one hand with KJo from BTN position with a raise. That's a much better hand and position.\n\nOpponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB): Has shown some aggression with a preflop raise in hand #5, and calls/bets postflop. Could be a thinking player.\n- MiniMax-M2: Has shown aggression postflop with bets on flop and turn in hand #6.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Raised preflop from SB in hand #7, otherwise folds.\n\nI'm first to act preflop with a terrible hand. The pot is 3 chips (SB + BB). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop. That's 1% of my stack (197 chips). While the immediate pot odds are okay (getting 1.5:1), the hand has very little potential. Q6o is dominated by any Q with better kicker, and even if I hit a Q, I'm vulnerable to better kickers. The 6 is basically useless.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 98.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands from early position. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots.\n\nAll factors point to folding:\n1. Terrible hand strength (Q6o)\n2. Worst position (UTG)\n3. Many players left to act who could raise\n4. Tournament - preserve stack\n5. Even if I call, I'm likely to face raises behind me\n\nI should fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze the current situation. I have KJo (Jh Kd) in UTG position with 98.5 BB stack. This is a marginal hand in early position. Looking at the history:\n\n1. In hand #8, I had KJo on the button and raised to 6 (3x) and won the blinds. That was in late position though.\n2. From the opponent observations, Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raised preflop in hand #1 from BB position (raised to 8, 4x BB). Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1) raised preflop in hand #5 from UTG (raised to 6, 3x BB). So both Kimi players are capable of raising.\n\nMy position is UTG, which is the worst position to play from. KJo offsuit is not a strong hand - it's generally folded from early positions in tournament poker. With 5 players left to act behind me, I could easily face raises.\n\nHowever, the blinds are small (1/2) relative to stacks, so there's some room to see a flop cheaply. But if I just call, I risk being raised by later positions.\n\nLooking at stack sizes: everyone has similar stacks around 190-226 chips (95-113 BB). No one is short-stacked.\n\nStandard tournament strategy: Fold KJo from UTG. It's a hand that can get you into trouble - dominated by AK, AQ, KQ, and even KJ suited. When you hit a pair, you're often behind better kings or jacks.\n\nGiven my history of mostly folding (8 folds out of 9 hands), I need to be selective. I won one hand with KJo on the button, but that's different from UTG.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. Let me consider alternatives:\n- Call: Risk being raised, out of position with a marginal hand\n- Raise: With KJo UTG, I'd be raising into 4 players, likely only getting called by better hands\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger spot. I have a healthy stack (98.5 BB), no need to play marginal hands from early position.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

MiniMax-M2 has shown tight tendencies (7 folds in 10 hands). Pot odds of 28.6% require ~29% equity, which Tc 4h likely doesn't have. Better to preserve stack and wait for better spots with positional advantage.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I have a good picture of the situation:\n\n1. My hand: Tc 4h - This is a very weak hand, especially offsuit with no connectivity. Ten-high with a weak kicker.\n\n2. Position: I'm on the BTN (button), which is a great position, but the hand is terrible.\n\n3. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) raised to 4 chips. Looking at their history, they've raised once before (hand #6) with Qs Ks, which is a premium hand. They've mostly been folding preflop (7 folds out of 10 hands), calling twice, and raising once. They seem relatively tight.\n\n4. My stack: 195 chips (97.5 BB) - healthy stack.\n5. Pot: Currently 7 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 4 raise)\n6. Amount to call: 2 chips (since I already posted BB of 2)\n7. Pot odds: I need to call 2 to win 7, so pot odds are 2:7 or 28.6%. My hand needs ~29% equity to justify a call.\n\n8. Tournament considerations: I have a decent stack, no need to take unnecessary risks with such a weak hand.\n\nAnalysis:\n- Tc 4h has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a wide range, it's likely below 30% equity.\n- Being on the button gives me positional advantage postflop, but with such a weak hand, I'll often miss the flop and have to fold.\n- MiniMax-M2 has shown to be tight (7 folds, 2 calls, 1 raise in 10 hands). Their raise likely indicates a decent hand.\n- The raise size is small (min-raise to 4, which is 2BB total), which could indicate either weakness or trapping with a strong hand.\n\nGiven that I need ~29% equity and Tc 4h likely has less than that against a tight opponent's raising range, this is an easy fold. Even if I call, I'll be out of position postflop (actually wait, I'm on the button, so I'll have position on the raiser who is in the SB? Let me check: Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, who is in the SB position? Actually looking at the players: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded, I'm Seat 3 (BTN), Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, Seat 5 folded. So MiniMax-M2 is in the CO position? Wait, the positions: Seat 1 is UTG, Seat 2 is SB, I'm Seat 3 (BTN), Seat 4 is BB, Seat 5 is UTG? Actually with 5 players: Seat 1 would be UTG, Seat 2 SB, Seat 3 BB, Seat 4 BTN, Seat 5 CO? But the hand says: \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\" and \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2\" raised. So MiniMax-M2 is in the CO position (cutoff) and raised, and I'm on the BTN. So I would have position on them postflop.\n\nEven with position, the hand is too weak. Better to fold and wait for a better spot. My tournament stack is healthy, no need to defend with such trash.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

AQo is a premium hand that plays well postflop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position at the table. I get to act last on every postflop street, giving me a significant advantage.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 194 chips (97 BB), which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2, so we're playing deep stacked poker.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression - raised in hand #6 and #11, but folded many other times. Showed Qs Ks in hand #6.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised big in hand #10 (12 chips), but also folded often. Showed As 5h in hand #9.\n\n5. **Action**: Everyone folded to me on the button. I'm facing just the blinds (SB and BB). The amount to call is 2 chips (the BB). I can fold, call, or raise.\n\n6. **Strategic considerations**:\n   - With AQo on the button against only the blinds, this is a clear raise situation.\n   - Raising puts pressure on the blinds and allows me to take the pot preflop often.\n   - Even if called, I have position and a strong hand.\n   - Standard raise size would be 3-4x the BB (6-8 chips) or potentially larger given deep stacks.\n\n7. **My history**: I've been fairly tight (only 1 win in 12 hands, mostly folding). A raise here with AQo would be appropriate and show some aggression.\n\nGiven that the minimum raise is to 4 chips (total), I should raise to around 6-8 chips. Let's go with 6 chips (3x BB), which is a standard raise size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 6,\n  \"reasoning\": \"AQo on button vs blinds is a strong raising hand.

I have overcards to the T (Ace and Queen are both higher than Ten). No flush draws for me, but I do have backdoor straight potential if a J and K come. The board is paired with 2s, which reduces the likelihood opponent has trips (though possible).\n\n2. **Opponent Analysis:** From the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has only checked or called on flops in previous hands. This is their first flop bet we've seen. They called my preflop raise from the BB, so their range could be wide: pocket pairs, suited connectors, Broadway cards, etc. The small bet of 8 into 21 (about 38% pot) could be a probe bet with a weak hand, a value bet with a medium pair, or a draw.\n\n3. **Pot Odds:** I need to call 8 to win 29 (21+8). That's about 3.6:1 pot odds, or 27.6% equity needed. Against a range of hands that might bet this flop (pairs, draws, some bluffs), AQ likely has around 30-40% equity. So pot odds are favorable.\n\n4. **Position:** I have position advantage (button) which is valuable. I can see what opponent does on turn before acting.\n\n5. **Stack Sizes:** Both stacks are deep (94 BB effective). This allows for post-flop play.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I have a healthy stack. Being aggressive with position and a decent hand makes sense.\n\n**Decision:** I should call. Reasons:\n- Good pot odds (27.6% equity needed, AQ likely has more)\n- Position advantage\n- Opponent's first flop bet could be weak\n- Overcards have decent equity against many hands\n- If I hit an Ace or Queen on turn, I can win a big pot\n- If I miss, I can reevaluate on turn\n\nA raise could also be considered to take initiative, but with a paired board and opponent's first aggression, calling seems more prudent to keep the pot controlled and use position."

I have overcards to the T (Ace and Queen are both higher than Ten). No flush draws for me, but I do have backdoor straight potential if a J and K come. The board is paired with 2s, which reduces the likelihood opponent has trips (though possible).\n\n2. **Opponent Analysis:** From the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has only checked or called on flops in previous hands. This is their first flop bet we've seen. They called my preflop raise from the BB, so their range could be wide: pocket pairs, suited connectors, Broadway cards, etc. The small bet of 8 into 21 (about 38% pot) could be a probe bet with a weak hand, a value bet with a medium pair, or a draw.\n\n3. **Pot Odds:** I need to call 8 to win 29 (21+8). That's about 3.6:1 pot odds, or 27.6% equity needed. Against a range of hands that might bet this flop (pairs, draws, some bluffs), AQ likely has around 30-40% equity. So pot odds are favorable.\n\n4. **Position:** I have position advantage (button) which is valuable. I can see what opponent does on turn before acting.\n\n5. **Stack Sizes:** Both stacks are deep (94 BB effective). This allows for post-flop play.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I have a healthy stack. Being aggressive with position and a decent hand makes sense.\n\n**Decision:** I should call. Reasons:\n- Good pot odds (27.6% equity needed, AQ likely has more)\n- Position advantage\n- Opponent's first flop bet could be weak\n- Overcards have decent equity against many hands\n- If I hit an Ace or Queen on turn, I can win a big pot\n- If I miss, I can reevaluate on turn\n\nA raise could also be considered to take initiative, but with a paired board and opponent's first aggression, calling seems more prudent to keep the pot controlled and use position.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm on the button with Qd Ah (Ace-Queen offsuit). The board is 2d 2c Tc 4s (paired deuces, ten, four). The pot is 29 chips. The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) in seat 5 checked to me on the turn. I have 180 chips (90 BB), opponent has 182 chips.\n\nI raised preflop to 6 (3x BB), opponent called. On the flop (2d 2c Tc), opponent bet 8 into a pot of ~13, I called. Now turn is 4s, opponent checks.\n\nMy hand: AQ offsuit. I have Ace high with a Queen kicker. Board is 2d 2c Tc 4s. I have no pair, no draw. Best I have is Ace high with backdoor straight possibilities (needs K and J for Broadway, or 5 and 3 for wheel). Actually, with Q-A, I need specifically K-J for straight, or 5-3 for wheel. Not great.\n\nOpponent's range: They called my preflop raise from BB. Could have a wide range: any pocket pair, suited connectors, broadway cards, etc. On flop they bet 8 into ~13. Could be betting a ten, a pocket pair above ten, a flush draw (though only one club on board), or a bluff. Now they check turn.\n\nGiven they checked turn, they might be giving up with a weak hand, or they might have a medium strength hand and want to check-call. Could also be trapping with a monster like 2x or TT.\n\nI should consider betting for value/protection. With Ace high, I could try to take it down now. But I need to think about opponent's tendencies. From the data, GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop twice (hand 7 and 10), folded preflop 4 times, called once. Not enough data on post-flop play. Only one hand went to showdown (hand 9) where they checked all streets.\n\nPot is 29, I could bet maybe 15-20 to apply pressure. If opponent calls, I'm likely behind. But if they fold, I win the pot. My stack is 180, betting 20 is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, I could check back and try to improve on river. But with Ace high, improving is unlikely unless I hit an Ace or Queen (6 outs). Actually, 3 Aces + 3 Queens = 6 outs. That's about 12% chance to hit on river. Not great.\n\nI think a moderate bet is best. If opponent raises, I can fold. If they call, I need to re-evaluate on river.\n\nLet me check if there are any flush draws: board has 2d 2c Tc 4s. Only one club, so no flush draw. Straight draws possible: someone could have 53 for open-ended, or A3 for gutshot, or J9 for open-ended. But with my AQ, I block some of those.\n\nI'll bet about 18 chips (half pot to 2/3 pot). That seems reasonable.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm in UTG position with A6 offsuit. My stack is 209 chips (104.5 BB). The blinds are 1/2. I need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been playing fairly tight - I folded KJ from UTG in hand #10, and folded 8T suited from UTG in hand #5. Now I have A6 offsuit, which is a marginal hand from UTG.\n\nFrom the opponent observations:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB) has shown some aggression - raised to 6 from UTG in hand #5, raised to 8 from SB in hand #12, and called raises. They have 291 chips.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has raised from BB with QsKs in hand #6, and folded to raises.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB) has raised preflop in hand #7 and hand #10.\n\nMy position is UTG, which is the worst position at the table. With A6 offsuit, this is a weak hand to open with. Ace-rag offsuit is generally a fold from UTG in most poker strategies because:\n1. It's dominated by better aces (AJ+, AQ, AK)\n2. It plays poorly postflop\n3. We're out of position against the entire table\n4. We have 3 players left to act behind us\n\nLooking at stack sizes, I have 104.5 BB, which is healthy. I don't need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands.\n\nThe pot odds: need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so getting 1.5:1 odds. But implied odds are poor because we're out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: I want to preserve my stack and wait for better spots. I've won 2 hands already (hand #8 with KJo from BTN, hand #13 with AQo from BTN), so I can afford to be patient.\n\nGiven all this, the correct play is to fold A6o from UTG. It's too weak to open, and calling just invites trouble from players behind.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific opponent tendencies that might change this decision. Looking at the search results, players have been fairly active, so opening with A6o could easily get raised behind me.\n\nI should fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me think through this situation:\n\nI'm UTG (under the gun) with A\u26606\u2666. This is not a strong UTG hand. Ace-rag offsuit is generally a fold from early position in tournament poker, especially with 104.5 BB deep stacks.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression with raises from various positions (raised to 6 in hand 5, raised to 8 in hand 12), but also folds frequently.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Mostly folds preflop, called once when facing an 8-chip raise.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Mixed actions - raised once, called once, folded other times.\n\nI have 209 chips (104.5 BB), which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2, so 2 chips to call is just 1 BB.\n\nHowever, being UTG with A6o is problematic:\n1. We're first to act with a marginal hand\n2. Many players left to act behind us (5 players total)\n3. A6o doesn't play well multi-way\n4. We could easily be dominated by better aces (AJ+, AQ, AK)\n5. Even if we hit an ace, we have weak kicker problems\n\nMy hand history shows I've folded both times I was UTG before (with 8\u2666T\u2666 and J\u2665K\u2666). KJo is actually a stronger UTG hand than A6o, and I folded that.\n\nPot odds: 2 chips to call into 3 chip pot (1.5:1), but we need to consider implied odds and reverse implied odds.\n\nTournament considerations: With 104.5 BB, I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots. Playing marginal hands from early position can lead to difficult postflop decisions and stack erosion.\n\nGiven all this, the correct play is to fold. We wait for a better hand in better position.",

Jack-high with a weak kicker, offsuit. This is a trash hand in multi-way raised pot.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has raised preflop once before (hand #11). Mostly folds. Seems somewhat tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded or called. Only one showdown with A5o. Seems passive.\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has called in multiple spots. Shows down medium-strength hands like 98s, 98o.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 4 chips to win current pot of 19 chips. That's about 4.75:1 pot odds (21% equity needed). However, this is preflop with a very weak hand, and there are still players to act behind me (the SB already folded).\n\n**Position:** I'm in SB, worst position postflop. With Jh 3s, I'll be out of position against 3 opponents.\n\n**Stack Sizes:** I have 207 chips, which is healthy (103.5 BB). Seat 4 has 172, Seat 5 has 173, Seat 1 has 298.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I should preserve my stack. Getting involved with Jh 3s from SB in a multi-way raised pot is terrible.\n\n**Alternative Considerations:** Could I raise? Minimum raise to 8 total. But with Jh 3s, raising would be spewy. Could get re-raised by Seat 1 who already called.\n\n**Decision:** This is an easy fold. Jh 3s is not playable from SB facing a raise and re-raise with a caller. Even with good pot odds, the hand is too weak and position is terrible. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nI'll fold."

Jack-high with a weak kicker, offsuit. This is a trash hand in multi-way raised pot.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has raised preflop once before (hand #11). Mostly folds. Seems somewhat tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has mostly folded or called. Only one showdown with A5o. Seems passive.\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has called in multiple spots. Shows down medium-strength hands like 98s, 98o.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 4 chips to win current pot of 19 chips. That's about 4.75:1 pot odds (21% equity needed). However, this is preflop with a very weak hand, and there are still players to act behind me (the SB already folded).\n\n**Position:** I'm in SB, worst position postflop. With Jh 3s, I'll be out of position against 3 opponents.\n\n**Stack Sizes:** I have 207 chips, which is healthy (103.5 BB). Seat 4 has 172, Seat 5 has 173, Seat 1 has 298.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I should preserve my stack. Getting involved with Jh 3s from SB in a multi-way raised pot is terrible.\n\n**Alternative Considerations:** Could I raise? Minimum raise to 8 total. But with Jh 3s, raising would be spewy. Could get re-raised by Seat 1 who already called.\n\n**Decision:** This is an easy fold. Jh 3s is not playable from SB facing a raise and re-raise with a caller. Even with good pot odds, the hand is too weak and position is terrible. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nI'll fold.",

I need to act from SB. My options: fold, call, raise. Amount to call is 4 chips (from my BB of 2 to total of 6). Minimum raise to is 8 total.\n\nMy hand is terrible: Jh 3s offsuit. I'm out of position against multiple opponents. There's already a raise and a re-raise with a caller. This is a clear fold. Even with pot odds of 4 to win 19 (4.75:1), I need about 21% equity. Jh 3s has maybe 15-20% equity against ranges that include raises and re-raises. But position is horrible.\n\nI should fold.

The pot is currently 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise = 9).\n\nFrom opponent data: Seat 2 has folded 11 times, called once, checked once, and raised twice in hand #1 and #2. So they're generally tight but have raised twice early in the tournament. Their stack is 125 chips (62.5 BB).\n\nMy hand: K9 offsuit is not a strong hand, especially from the small blind. It's a marginal hand that doesn't play well out of position. However, I have decent pot odds: need to call 5 to win 9, which is about 1.8:1 odds (35.7% equity needed).\n\nBut I'm out of position against the raiser, which is a big disadvantage. Also, the BB (Seat 4) still has to act behind me with 318 chips, so there's risk of a squeeze.\n\nLooking at my own history: I had K9 offsuit in hand #12 from SB and folded preflop. That seems reasonable.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 206 chips (103 BB), which is a healthy stack. Seat 2 has 125 chips, Seat 4 has 318 chips. I shouldn't risk chips with marginal hands out of position.\n\nThe opponent's raise size is small (3x BB), which could indicate a wider range, but K9o doesn't fare well against a typical raising range.\n\nGiven all factors: fold seems correct. The pot odds are decent but position is terrible, hand is weak, and there's risk from the BB behind me. Better to wait for better spots."

I need to call 5 more chips. The pot is currently 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise = 9).\n\nFrom opponent data: Seat 2 has folded 11 times, called once, checked once, and raised twice in hand #1 and #2. So they're generally tight but have raised twice early in the tournament. Their stack is 125 chips (62.5 BB).\n\nMy hand: K9 offsuit is not a strong hand, especially from the small blind. It's a marginal hand that doesn't play well out of position. However, I have decent pot odds: need to call 5 to win 9, which is about 1.8:1 odds (35.7% equity needed).\n\nBut I'm out of position against the raiser, which is a big disadvantage. Also, the BB (Seat 4) still has to act behind me with 318 chips, so there's risk of a squeeze.\n\nLooking at my own history: I had K9 offsuit in hand #12 from SB and folded preflop. That seems reasonable.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 206 chips (103 BB), which is a healthy stack. Seat 2 has 125 chips, Seat 4 has 318 chips. I shouldn't risk chips with marginal hands out of position.\n\nThe opponent's raise size is small (3x BB), which could indicate a wider range, but K9o doesn't fare well against a typical raising range.\n\nGiven all factors: fold seems correct. The pot odds are decent but position is terrible, hand is weak, and there's risk from the BB behind me. Better to wait for better spots.",

The SB (MiniMax-M2, 317 chips) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B, 42 chips) are yet to act after me. UTG and UTG+1 have folded.\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has shown some aggression with raises preflop in hand #16, but also folded in several hands. Has a healthy stack.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has only 42 chips (21 BB) and has shown some aggression with raises preflop in hand #16, but also folded recently.\n\nMy hand A3o is marginal. On the button, I have position advantage. With two players left to act, I need to consider:\n1. The BB is short-stacked (42 chips) and might be looking to defend or shove with a wide range.\n2. The SB has a big stack and could 3-bet.\n\nLooking at my own history: I've been playing tight, winning only 2 of 17 hands, mostly folding.\n\nGiven the situation:\n- Calling 2 chips to see a flop is cheap (1% of my stack).\n- Raising could isolate the short-stacked BB or get 3-bet by the SB.\n- Folding is too tight given my position and the cheap price.\n\nWith A3o, I have an ace which is good, but the 3 is weak. However, being on the button gives me good post-flop control. The BB is short-stacked and might shove any decent hand, which could put me in a tough spot if I just call.\n\nI think a small raise to 4-6 chips could be good to:\n1. Isolate the short-stacked BB\n2. Potentially get the SB to fold\n3. Take control of the hand\n\nBut actually, looking at the stack sizes: BB has only 42 chips total. If I raise and BB shoves, I'd have to call off a significant portion of my stack with A3o. That's not ideal.\n\nMaybe a call is better to see a flop cheaply and play position. If the BB shoves, I can reevaluate.\n\nActually, let me think about tournament considerations. I have 103 BB, which is healthy. The BB is short (21 BB). I should be looking to accumulate chips when possible.\n\nGiven the button position and cheap price, I'll call and see a flop. If the BB shoves, I can fold unless I get a great price. If the SB raises, I can fold A3o easily.\n\nWait, looking at the legal actions: I can raise to minimum 4. That's just 2 more chips than calling. A min-raise might be okay to apply pressure.\n\nBut actually, with the BB so short, a min-raise might just invite a shove from the BB with a wide range, putting me in a tough spot.\n\nI think calling is the most balanced approach. Let me call and use my position post-flop.",

This is a weak hand - I have ace-high with a weak kicker. The board is paired with Kings, which reduces the chance my ace is good. I have no draws - no flush draw, no straight draw. Best case scenario is that opponent has nothing and I can win with ace-high.\n\n2. **Opponent analysis:** GPT-OSS-120B has only 42 chips (21 BB). Looking at their recent actions, in hand #16 they were quite aggressive with raises preflop and on the turn. They seem willing to play aggressively when they have a hand. Their check here could mean weakness, but with such a short stack, they might be looking for a spot to go all-in.\n\n3. **Stack sizes:** I have a huge stack advantage (204 vs 42). The opponent is in a desperate situation and will likely look to double up soon. My stack is healthy at 102 BB.\n\n4. **Position:** I'm on the button, which is excellent. I can control the action and see what opponent does on later streets.\n\n5. **Pot odds:** Currently facing no bet, so pot odds aren't relevant for this decision.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** With opponent so short, I should be careful about giving them a chance to double up. However, I also want to accumulate chips when I have position and can apply pressure.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check here. Reasons:\n- My hand is very weak - ace-high on a paired board\n- If I bet and get raised (especially all-in from the short stack), I'll likely have to fold\n- Checking allows me to see a free turn card\n- I have position, so I can reassess on the turn\n- The pot is small (5 chips), not worth risking chips with such a weak hand\n- If opponent is weak, they might check again on the turn, giving me another free card\n- If opponent bets on the turn, I can easily fold\n\nBetting would be risky because the short stack might shove with any piece of the board (any K, J, or even pocket pair), and I'd have to fold. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to potentially improve or bluff later streets if opponent shows weakness.\n\n**Action:** Check.",

The board shows Kd Jc Kh 2d. There are two kings on board, making it very likely someone has trips or better. I have no pair, just Ace-high with a flush draw.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the data, GPT-OSS-120B has 42 chips (very short stack). They've shown some aggressive tendencies (hand #16 they 3-bet preflop with Jh 3s). They've also folded to river bets (hand #15). They're likely playing tight due to short stack.\n\n**My hand equity:**\n- I need one more diamond for a flush (9 outs)\n- Ace might be good if opponent has nothing\n- But with two kings on board, many hands beat me\n\n**Pot odds and stack considerations:**\nPot is only 5 chips. Opponent has 42 chips total. If I bet and they call or raise, I could be putting chips at risk with a weak hand.\n\n**Tournament situation:**\nI have a healthy stack (204 chips, 102 BB). Opponent is very short (42 chips, 21 BB). I should be careful not to give away chips unnecessarily.\n\n**Decision:**\nSince opponent checked and pot is small, I should probably check behind. Betting here would be risky:\n1. If opponent has a king, they'll call or raise\n2. If they don't have a king, they'll likely fold anyway\n3. My hand has some showdown value (Ace-high) that might be best if checked down\n\nChecking allows me to see a free river and potentially improve to a flush. If I improve on river, I can value bet. If not, I can check and potentially win at showdown if opponent has nothing.\n\n**Better to check and preserve chips.**",

Most hands that called preflop would have at least a pair or draw. However, opponent is short-stacked and might have missed completely.\n2. **Pot size**: Only 5 chips - small pot\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Has shown willingness to fold postflop when weak (folded on river in hand 15)\n4. **Stack preservation**: With my healthy stack vs opponent's short stack, risking chips to win small pot might not be optimal\n5. **Value bet potential**: If I bet, opponent might fold worse hands (any undercards, missed draws). But opponent might call with any pair or better.\n\nGiven the paired board with Kings, my Ace-high is vulnerable. Many hands that called preflop would have something: any pocket pair, any King, any Jack, any Ten, any draw. The board is Kd Jc Kh 2d Th - straight draws missed (only Q9 would have straight, but unlikely).\n\nI think checking is best here. Reasons:\n1. Small pot not worth risking chips\n2. Paired board reduces value of Ace-high\n3. Opponent might call with any pair\n4. If I bet and get raised (though unlikely given opponent's stack), I'd have to fold\n5. Tournament considerations: Preserve chips for better spots\n\nBetter to check and see what opponent has, learn about their tendencies.",

It's a garbage hand that has almost no potential to make a strong hand postflop. Even if I hit a pair, it's a weak pair with poor kicker. The hand is not suited, not connected, and very low.\n\nIn tournament poker, preserving chips is important, and playing this hand from UTG would be a major mistake. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nLet me check if there are any tournament considerations: I have 104.5 BB, which is a healthy stack, so I don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n\nThe pot odds: I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds, but with such a terrible hand, the implied odds are terrible too.\n\nI should fold.

I need to call 8 chips into a pot of 28 chips (my 4 BB already in plus 12 from UTG plus 12 from SB). That's pot odds of 8 to 28, or 1:3.5, meaning I need about 22% equity to call.\n\nMy hand: Jh8h suited. This is a speculative hand that needs help postflop. Against an UTG raise and a SB call, my equity is likely marginal. From the opponent data:\n\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has shown some aggression (bet on flop and river in hand 20), but I don't see preflop raises in the limited data. Called twice from SB in previous hands.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has raised preflop twice (hands 17 and 20) from what appears to be SB/BB positions. Called a raise here.\n\nMy position is worst (BB) and I'll be out of position postflop against both players. My stack is 205 chips (51 BB), which is healthy but not huge.\n\nThe pot is 28, I need to call 8. If I call, pot becomes 36. Implied odds: if I hit a flush draw or straight draw, I could potentially win more. But being out of position makes it harder to realize equity.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack but not dominant. Folding preserves my stack. Calling with a marginal hand out of position could lead to difficult decisions postflop.\n\nGiven the UTG raise (usually indicates strength) and a caller, plus my poor position, I should probably fold. Jh8h suited isn't strong enough to defend against an UTG raise multi-way.\n\nHowever, let me check if there are any patterns: Seat 1 hasn't shown preflop raises in my limited data, but that could mean this is a stronger range. Seat 2 called, which could mean medium strength.\n\nActually, wait: I should consider that I'm getting 3.5:1 odds. With suited connectors, I need about 20-25% equity. Against a reasonable UTG range and a caller, Jh8s probably has around 25-30% equity. But being out of position reduces my ability to realize that equity.\n\nI think folding is correct here. Better to wait for a better spot with position.\n\nBut let me think about raising: I could raise to isolate or take down the pot now. Minimum raise to 20. That would be 16 more chips (20 total). Pot would be 44 (28 + 16). But I'd be risking 20 chips with a marginal hand against two players who have shown some interest. If I get called or re-raised, I'm in trouble.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: Seat 2 has only 148 chips (37 BB) after posting SB and calling. Seat 1 has 256 chips (64 BB).

I need to call 8 chips into a pot of 28 chips (my 4 BB already in plus 12 from UTG plus 12 from SB). That's pot odds of 8 to 28, or 1:3.5, meaning I need about 22% equity to call.\n\nMy hand: Jh8h suited. This is a speculative hand that needs help postflop. Against an UTG raise and a SB call, my equity is likely marginal. From the opponent data:\n\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has shown some aggression (bet on flop and river in hand 20), but I don't see preflop raises in the limited data. Called twice from SB in previous hands.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has raised preflop twice (hands 17 and 20) from what appears to be SB/BB positions. Called a raise here.\n\nMy position is worst (BB) and I'll be out of position postflop against both players. My stack is 205 chips (51 BB), which is healthy but not huge.\n\nThe pot is 28, I need to call 8. If I call, pot becomes 36. Implied odds: if I hit a flush draw or straight draw, I could potentially win more. But being out of position makes it harder to realize equity.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack but not dominant. Folding preserves my stack. Calling with a marginal hand out of position could lead to difficult decisions postflop.\n\nGiven the UTG raise (usually indicates strength) and a caller, plus my poor position, I should probably fold.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have more information. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop before - to 6 in hand 5 and 8 in hand 12. Their showdown hands were 98s and 98o - medium suited connectors. So their raising range might include speculative hands. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop multiple times, including with AKs in hand 20. They called here from SB.\n\nGiven Seat 1's raising range might include hands like 98s, my Jh8h is actually similar but slightly better (higher cards, suited). I'm getting 3.5:1 odds. Against two players, Jh8s has decent equity if we hit a flush or straight. But being out of position is a big disadvantage.\n\nHowever, the pot odds are good. If I call 8 into 28, that's 22% equity needed. Against two opponents with reasonable ranges, Jh8s probably has 25-30% equity. The problem is realizing that equity out of position.\n\nI could consider raising to 20 to try to take it down now. But Seat 1 has 256 chips and might call or re-raise. Seat 2 has 148 and might fold or call.\n\nActually, looking at Seat 1's previous raises: 6 and 8. Here they raised to 12 (3x). That's larger than before. Could indicate strength. Seat 2 called, which might indicate medium strength.\n\nI think folding is still reasonable. But let me check if there are any other factors. My stack is 205, blinds are 2/4. I have plenty of chips. No need to gamble with marginal hand out of position.\n\nI'll fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand:\n\nI'm in the SB with 5s 9d, which is a weak hand - 9 high, offsuit, no straight potential. The pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 12). Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 total (8 more than BB). I need to call 10 chips to continue.\n\nFrom opponent data, Seat 2 has been raising frequently preflop (4 times in 20 hands), with raises ranging from 6-8 chips. In hand #20, they showed Ks As when they raised, so they can have strong hands. But they're also raising frequently, which suggests they might be aggressive.\n\nMy stack is 203 chips (50.8 BB), which is healthy. Seat 2 has 164 chips. The BB (Seat 4) has 318 chips and hasn't acted yet - they could still call or raise.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 10 to win 18, so about 1.8:1 odds (35.7% equity needed). 5-9o has very low equity against a raising range. Even against a wide range, it's probably around 25-30% at best.\n\nPosition is terrible - I'll be out of position postflop against the raiser.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack, no need to gamble with weak hands. Folding costs me only my 2 chip SB already invested.\n\nLooking at my history from SB: I've folded all 4 times when facing action. This seems correct given typical SB play with weak hands.\n\nThe hand is 5-9 offsuit - one of the worst starting hands. Even with good pot odds, being out of position with such a weak hand makes this a clear fold.\n\nI should fold and preserve my stack for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the Button with Jc9c. This is a suited connector, which has decent potential for multi-way pots. The pot is 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4). Both players ahead of me (Seat 1 and 2) have folded. Now it's just me against the SB (Seat 4) and BB (Seat 5).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression. In hand #19, they raised preflop from SB. In hand #22, they called a raise from SB. They also bet on flops when they have initiative.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been very passive, often checking or folding. They have a very short stack of only 37 chips (9.25 BB).\n\nMy position is excellent - I'm on the Button. With J9 suited, I have good implied odds if I hit a flush or straight. The BB has a very short stack, so they might be forced to go all-in with any decent hand.\n\nStack sizes:\n- Me: 203 chips (50.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- SB: 292 chips (73 BB) - big stack\n- BB: 37 chips (9.25 BB) - very short\n\nThe BB is so short that they'll likely call with a wide range. The SB might defend with a wide range too.\n\nGiven my position and the hand strength, I should consider raising to isolate the short stack BB or take it down preflop. A small raise to 8 chips (minimum raise) would put pressure on both players.\n\nHowever, J9s is not a premium hand. It's a speculative hand that plays well multi-way or in position. Since both opponents have yet to act, and the BB is very short, I might want to just call and see a flop cheaply, hoping to hit something strong.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. That's decent for a suited connector.\n\nBut with my position, I could also raise to 8 chips. That would be a 2x raise over the BB. This might get folds from the SB and BB, or isolate the short stack.\n\nGiven the tournament context and my stack size, I should play cautiously but take advantage of position. The BB is so short that they might shove any two cards, which would put me in a tough spot if I raise.\n\nActually, looking at the BB's history: they've folded a lot preflop recently (hands 19-22). They might be waiting for a premium hand to shove with their short stack.\n\nI think the best play is to call and see a flop cheaply. If I raise and get re-raised by the SB or shoved on by the BB, I'll have to fold J9s. By calling, I keep the pot small and can play postflop in position.\n\nDecision: Call.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me check opponent tendencies. We're on the button with J9 suited. We have 50.8 BB, which is healthy. The SB (Seat 4) has 292 chips (73 BB) and BB (Seat 5) has only 37 chips (9.25 BB) - very short stacked.\n\nWe're in position with a speculative hand. J9 suited can make strong flushes, straights, and occasional top pair. Being on the button is great for position. The BB is very short, so they might be forced to call with a wide range if we raise.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips, we need to call 4 to see the flop. Minimum raise is to 8 total. Let me think about options:\n\n1. Fold: J9 suited isn't premium, but we're on the button with only blinds left to act. The BB is very short, which changes dynamics.\n\n2. Call: Limping in from the button with a speculative hand is reasonable.\n\n3. Raise: Could raise to take initiative and potentially isolate the short stack.\n\nGiven the BB's stack is only 37 chips (9.25 BB), if we raise to say 12-16, they might be forced to go all-in with a wide range. This creates a good spot to potentially win their stack if they fold or we hit.\n\nBut we need to be careful about the SB who has a big stack. They might defend wide.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: BB has 37 chips. If we raise to 12 (3x), they'd have to call 8 more to win ~18 (pot 6 + our 12). That's about 2.25:1 pot odds, which might force them to call with many hands. If they shove, we'd have to call 25 more to win ~50, getting 2:1 odds.\n\nWith J9 suited, I'm comfortable calling a shove from the BB getting 2:1 odds. The hand has decent equity against many ranges.\n\nI think raising is best here to put pressure on the short stack and take initiative. Let's raise to 12 (3x).",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with Jc9c\n- Board: Js 3c 2h\n- I raised preflop to 12 (3x BB), MiniMax-M2 called from SB\n- Flop: MiniMax-M2 bets 8 into pot of 36\n- Amount to call: 8, pot is 44 after call\n- My stack: 191 chips (47.8 BB)\n- MiniMax-M2 stack: 274 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have top pair with jack and a weak kicker (9). The board is dry with Js 3c 2h - no flush draws, only possible straight draws would be with 54 or A4. This is a favorable flop for my hand.\n\n**Opponent analysis from memory:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's actions:\n- Hand #19: Preflop raise to 4, then bet 2 on flop\n- Hand #22: Called preflop raise of 8, then bet 16 on flop, then folded to a raise\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 tends to continuation bet on flops but might fold to aggression. The bet of 8 into 36 pot is a small bet (22% pot), which could be a probe bet with a weak hand or a draw.\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\nI have position on MiniMax-M2 (BTN vs SB). My stack is 191 vs opponent's 274. Pot odds: 8 to win 44 = 1:5.5 or ~18% equity needed. I have top pair which is likely good here.\n\n**Possible hands for opponent:**\n- Could have called preflop with many hands: small to medium pairs, suited connectors, broadway cards\n- Small bet could mean: weak jack with worse kicker, middle/bottom pair, draw, or complete bluff\n\n**Decision:**\nI should raise here. Reasons:\n1. Top pair on dry board is strong\n2. Opponent's small bet suggests weakness\n3. I have position advantage\n4. Opponent has shown tendency to fold to aggression on flop (Hand #22)\n5. Raising can get value from worse hands and protect against draws\n6. If called, I can evaluate turn action\n\nRaise size: Minimum raise to 16 seems small. I should raise larger - maybe to 24-28 (3-3.5x the bet). Let's do 24 total (12 more). This builds the pot while giving bad odds to draws.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Top pair on dry board with position. Opponent's small 22% pot bet suggests weakness. History shows opponent folds to flop aggression.

In hand #16, they had KK and checked turn after betting flop. They seem to be a fairly active player who bets flops often.\n\n**Hand Strength Evaluation:**\n- I have middle pair with weak kicker\n- The Q on turn is bad for my hand - beats any J, creates potential straight draws\n- My hand is vulnerable to many better hands: Qx, better Jx, sets, two pairs\n- I have little equity improvement - only 9 or J gives me two pair, but J could also complete straights\n- Backdoor flush draw is dead (Qh on board)\n\n**Position Advantage:**\nI'm on button, which is good. Opponent checked to me.\n\n**Decision Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take free card, see river. Low risk, but gives opponent free card.\n2. **Bet**: Try to take down pot now. Risk being called or raised.\n\n**Pot Control Considerations:**\nWith a marginal hand like middle pair weak kicker on a board that improved with Q, pot control might be wise. The pot is already 76 chips, which is significant relative to my 167 stack.\n\n**Opponent Range:**\n- Could have: Qx (likely), weaker Jx, draws, middle pairs, air\n- They called my flop raise, so likely has something\n- Q on turn likely improved their range if they have Qx\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- My hand is marginal and vulnerable\n- Q on turn likely improved opponent's range\n- Pot is already decent size relative to my stack\n- Checking allows me to see river cheaply and reevaluate\n- If I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot with marginal hand\n\nI think checking is the prudent play here. I'll take the free card and see what comes on river. If opponent bets river, I'll need to reevaluate based on bet size and card."

In hand #16, they had KK and checked turn after betting flop. They seem to be a fairly active player who bets flops often.\n\n**Hand Strength Evaluation:**\n- I have middle pair with weak kicker\n- The Q on turn is bad for my hand - beats any J, creates potential straight draws\n- My hand is vulnerable to many better hands: Qx, better Jx, sets, two pairs\n- I have little equity improvement - only 9 or J gives me two pair, but J could also complete straights\n- Backdoor flush draw is dead (Qh on board)\n\n**Position Advantage:**\nI'm on button, which is good. Opponent checked to me.\n\n**Decision Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take free card, see river. Low risk, but gives opponent free card.\n2. **Bet**: Try to take down pot now. Risk being called or raised.\n\n**Pot Control Considerations:**\nWith a marginal hand like middle pair weak kicker on a board that improved with Q, pot control might be wise. The pot is already 76 chips, which is significant relative to my 167 stack.\n\n**Opponent Range:**\n- Could have: Qx (likely), weaker Jx, draws, middle pairs, air\n- They called my flop raise, so likely has something\n- Q on turn likely improved their range if they have Qx\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- My hand is marginal and vulnerable\n- Q on turn likely improved opponent's range\n- Pot is already decent size relative to my stack\n- Checking allows me to see river cheaply and reevaluate\n- If I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot with marginal hand\n\nI think checking is the prudent play here. I'll take the free card and see what comes on river. If opponent bets river, I'll need to reevaluate based on bet size and card.",

The board is Js 3c 2h Qh 4c. The river brought a 4c, completing a possible flush draw (clubs), but I have Jc 9c - I have a club flush draw that missed (only one club on board, 4c). \n\nMy hand is marginal - just a pair of Jacks. The Q on turn is concerning as it beats me if opponent has Qx. The board is relatively dry - no straights possible (2,3,4, J, Q - gap between 4 and J).\n\nFrom opponent's actions:\n- Preflop: Called my raise from SB (reasonable defense)\n- Flop: Led out small bet (8 into ~28 pot), then called my raise\n- Turn: Checked after Q came (could be scared of Q, or trapping)\n- River: Checked (likely giving up or trapping)\n\nFrom opponent history:\n- Hand #6: Showed Qs Ks (top pair good kicker) when they checked river\n- Hand #16: Showed Kh Kc (overpair) when they checked river  \n- They tend to check strong hands on river sometimes\n\n**Possible opponent hands:**\n- Qx hands (QJ, Q10, Q9, etc.) - would likely bet river for value\n- Weaker Jacks (J10, J9, J8) - might check-call\n- Pocket pairs (33, 22) - sets would likely bet river\n- Missed draws (A10, K10, clubs) - likely checking\n- Bluffs that gave up\n\n**My decision:**\nI should check back. Reasons:\n1. My hand is marginal - just a pair of Jacks with 9 kicker\n2. I have showdown value but likely only beats bluffs\n3. If I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot\n4. Opponent called my flop raise, so likely has at least something\n5. The pot is already decent at 76 chips (19 BB)\n6. Tournament consideration: I have 41.8 BB, decent stack, no need to risk chips with marginal hand\n\nBetter to check and see if my Jacks are good. If opponent was on a draw that missed, I win. If they have a better hand, I lose minimal.\n\nLet me check back.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current hand:** Th 2h in SB (small blind)\n**My stack:** 239 chips (59.8 BB)\n**Blinds:** 2/4\n**Pot:** 22 chips (after MiniMax-M2 raised to 8 and Kimi-K2 Thinking called)\n**Amount to call:** 4 chips (I already posted 2 as SB, need 4 more to call the 8 total)\n\n**Position:** I'm in SB, which is a bad position postflop (will act first on every street after flop).\n\n**Hand strength:** Th 2h is a very weak hand. It's suited, but ten-high with a weak kicker. Suited connectors need higher cards to be playable. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n1. MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) raised to 8 (2x BB). From history: has been calling and betting but also folding. Seems somewhat active.\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1) called the raise. From history: has been folding a lot recently (folded last 4 hands), but called here. Might have a decent hand.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 22 chips, I need to call 4 chips. That's about 5.5:1 pot odds. However, position is terrible and hand is weak.\n\n**Stack considerations:** I have 239 chips (59.8 BB), which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots from bad position.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have a decent stack. No reason to get involved with Th 2h from SB when facing a raise and a call. Even if I flop a flush draw, I'll be out of position and could face more betting.\n\n**Better spots:** I should wait for better hands in better positions.\n\nThis is an easy fold. I already put in 2 chips as SB, but calling 4 more with Th 2h from SB is -EV.\n\nLet me check if there's any history of opponents bluffing or being loose that might change my decision. Looking at the opponent actions: both have been relatively tight recently. Kimi-K2 Thinking folded last 4 hands preflop. MiniMax-M2 folded last 2 hands preflop. So they're not overly loose.\n\n**Decision:** Fold.",

I need to call 2 more to play (total 4)\n- Pot: 6 chips currently (SB 2 + BB 4)\n- Minimum raise: to 8 total (4 more)\n\nFrom opponent data: MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression. They've raised preflop in hands 19 and 26, called raises in 22 and 23. They seem to play a reasonable range and will defend their BB.\n\nMy hand: T8o is marginal. On button, I can play many hands, but T8o is near the bottom of my range. However, with only 2 more chips to call into a 6-chip pot (3:1 pot odds), and position advantage, it's worth seeing a flop.\n\nIf I raise, I'd be making it 8 total (6 more). That's a 3x raise. With T8o, raising might not be optimal as I don't want to play a big pot with this hand. Better to call and see a flop cheaply.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 59BB, which is healthy. No need to take big risks with marginal hands. But calling 2 chips (0.5BB) with position is fine.\n\nFrom my hand history: I've been folding a lot (22 folds out of 26 hands). I should be playing more hands from button to accumulate chips.\n\nDecision: Call and see flop. Use position to potentially win pot postflop if opponent checks or shows weakness.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"T8o is marginal but with 3:1 pot odds and button position, calling 2 chips (0.5BB) to see flop is reasonable.

Their current raise is 12 total (8 more), which is a standard 3x BB raise.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 16 chips, I need to call 8 chips. That's 2:1 pot odds (33% equity needed). With 8\u2666 T\u2663, I don't have anywhere near 33% equity against a BB raising range.\n\n5. **Stack Sizes:** I have 235 chips (58.8 BB), opponent has 296 chips. Calling 8 chips is only 3.4% of my stack, but this is a tournament and chip preservation is important.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I'm in a good chip position (58.8 BB). No need to gamble with weak hands. Better to wait for better spots.\n\n7. **Alternatives:** I could consider a 3-bet bluff from the button, but with 8\u2666 T\u2663 and against an opponent who has shown willingness to raise with strong hands, this seems risky.\n\n**Conclusion:** Fold. The hand is too weak, pot odds don't justify calling, and position advantage doesn't overcome the hand weakness against a raise.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"8\u2666 T\u2663 is too weak to continue against a BB raise.

Hand strength: Ts5s is very weak, even suited. It's a hand that needs to hit the flop hard to continue.\n2. Position: Being on the button is great, but with such a weak hand, position alone may not justify playing.\n3. Stack sizes: The BB has only 43 chips, so any raise could commit him to go all-in.\n4. Tournament considerations: I have 58.8 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n5. Pot odds: To call 4 into a pot of 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. But the hand is so weak that even these odds aren't great.\n\nBetter options:\n- Fold: Ts5s is a trash hand. Even suited, it's dominated by almost any raising range.\n- Raise: Could try to steal the blinds, but MiniMax-M2 in SB has shown aggression and might defend, and BB is short-stacked and desperate.\n- Call: Would put me in a multi-way pot out of position postflop with a weak hand.\n\nGiven the short-stacked BB (only 43 chips), any action could induce an all-in from him. Ts5s doesn't play well against an all-in range. \n\nDecision: Fold. This hand is too weak to play, even from the button. The risk of the short-stacked BB shoving and the SB potentially defending makes this a clear fold. Preserve my stack for better spots.",

Looking at my hand history, I've been playing tight (only 4 wins out of 28 hands, lots of folds). \n\nThe table dynamics: Seat 2 (another Kimi-K2) has already folded. I'm first to act after the blinds. The players behind me include MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) who has been quite aggressive - raising preflop in multiple hands (26, 27, 28). GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) has a very short stack of only 29 chips (7.25 BB).\n\nFrom my opponent recall:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, seat 1) has mostly folded preflop, but did call once and then raised on the flop in hand 26.\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) is aggressive, raising preflop frequently.\n\nWith Q7o from UTG, this is an easy fold. I have position disadvantage, weak hand, and aggressive players behind me who could easily 3-bet. Even if I limp, I'll be out of position with a weak hand against potentially multiple opponents.\n\nMy stack is 235 chips (58.8 BB), which is healthy but not massive. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots. The short stack at seat 5 (29 chips) might be looking to shove soon, so I don't want to get involved with marginal hands.\n\nGiven all this, folding is the clear decision.",

I have 235 chips (58.8 BB), so I'm in good shape stack-wise.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has been fairly aggressive preflop, raising often (hands 26, 27, 28). They have a decent stack of 328 chips.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has a very short stack of 29 chips (7.25 BB). Has shown some aggression with raises, including a huge 41 chip raise in hand 25 (which was likely all-in or near all-in given their stack).\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot preflop, but showed some aggression postflop in hand 26.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): No data yet, but they're in the BB.\n\nAs UTG with a terrible hand, I should be folding almost always. With 3-5 offsuit, I'm dominated by almost any reasonable raising range. Even if I call, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand, which is a huge disadvantage.\n\nThe pot is only 6 chips, and it costs me 4 to call. The implied odds are poor with such a weak hand - even if I hit something like a straight draw, I'll be playing out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy 58.8 BB stack. There's no need to gamble with trash hands from early position. Seat 5 is very short-stacked (7.25 BB) and could go all-in at any moment, so I should wait for better spots.\n\nGiven all this, folding is clearly the correct play. I'll preserve my stack and wait for a better opportunity.",

Even against a wide range, it's probably around 25-30% equity at best. Against a tight range, it's much worse.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack (231 chips, 57.8 BB). No need to take marginal spots. Being out of position with a weak hand makes this an easy fold.\n\nThe opponent's raise size is 12 (3x BB), which is a standard raise. Their history shows they're fairly tight, so their range is likely stronger.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot. Folding preserves my stack.\n\nLet me check if there are any other relevant factors... The other players folded, so it's heads-up between me and Kimi-K2 Thinking. I'm in the BB, so I've already invested 4 chips, but that's a sunk cost.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Shows aggressive tendencies. Currently has 0 chips (out) but made this raise before busting.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Mostly folds preflop, but raised to 24 in hand #30 and called this 29 chip raise. Has shown AKs before. Seems somewhat tight but capable of calling raises.\n\nMy hand T6o is very weak. Even with pot odds, I need to consider:\n- Pot is 64 chips, I need to call 27 chips \u2192 pot odds of about 2.37:1 (27 to win 64)\n- Implied odds are poor because I'm out of position and have a weak hand\n- Even if I hit a pair, I could easily be dominated\n- Multiway pot with two opponents already involved\n\nMy stack is healthy at 57BB, so I don't need to take marginal spots. Folding here preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nThe fact that Seat 5 is out (0 chips) suggests this might be an all-in or near all-in situation for them, but they still have chips to play this hand. Actually wait, if they have 0 chips now, they must have gone all-in or busted after this hand. Their raise to 29 was likely a significant portion of their stack.\n\nGiven my terrible position with a weak hand, I should fold. The pot odds might seem tempting, but postflop play will be very difficult out of position with a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision:** Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the button with 9c6c. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (3x BB). I need to call 12 to see a flop. The pot is currently 18 (4 from BB, 2 from SB, plus 12 raise). \n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown some aggression - raised to 24 in hand 30, called 29 in hand 32, and bet on flop in hand 32.\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been mostly folding preflop, but showed some speculative hands like 98s, 98o in showdowns.\n\nMy hand: 9c6c is a suited connector, but not a great one. It's only 96 suited, which is pretty weak. The suited aspect gives some flush potential, but 96 is a long way from the nuts even if I hit a flush.\n\nPosition: I'm on the button, which is great position. However, I still have two players left to act behind me (SB and BB). Actually wait, SB already posted and BB is Seat 1. So there's still BB to act after me.\n\nStack sizes: I have 229 chips (57 BB), which is healthy. Seat 2 has 120 (30 BB), Seat 1 has 202 (50.5 BB).\n\nPot odds: I need to call 12 to win 30 (current pot 18 + my call 12 = 30). That's 2.5:1 odds, or 28.6% equity needed.\n\nHand equity: 96s vs a typical raising range has maybe 30-35% equity, but this is marginal. The problem is I'm out of position relative to the raiser (Seat 2) unless both blinds fold.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack and don't need to take big risks with marginal hands. This is a speculative hand that needs to hit the flop hard to continue.\n\nGiven the information:\n1. Weak suited connector\n2. Facing a raise from early position (Seat 2 is UTG+1 or MP)\n3. Decent pot odds but marginal equity\n4. Position advantage if I call\n5. But risk of re-raise from blinds\n\nI think this is a fold. 96s is too weak to call a raise, even on the button. Better to wait for stronger spots.",

They seem to be opening up their range.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is in the small blind and has shown aggressive tendencies with raises and 3-bets.\n\nMy hand: 9c6c is a suited connector, which plays well in position, but it's a weak hand overall. I'm on the button, which is the best position. However, I need to consider:\n\n1. Hand strength: 96s is weak - needs a good flop to continue\n2. Position: Good (button)\n3. Stack sizes: I have 57BB, opponent has 30BB (Seat 2), SB has 88BB\n4. Pot odds: Need to call 12 to win 30 (18+12), so I need ~29% equity\n5. Implied odds: If I hit a strong draw or hand, I can win more chips\n\nHowever, there are concerns:\n- The small blind (Seat 4) is aggressive and could squeeze/3-bet behind me\n- Even if I call, I'll be out of position against the raiser postflop unless SB folds\n- 96s doesn't play well against a raise range\n\nLooking at the data, Seat 2's raise could be wider since they've been folding a lot and might be opening up. But 96s is just too weak to call a raise, even in position. The suited aspect gives some value, but not enough to justify calling 12 chips (5.2% of my stack).\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot.

Poor hand strength, out of position, and likely dominated by opponent's raising range. With 56.2 BB stack, better to wait for a better spot despite 3:1 pot odds.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Qh 5d is a weak hand, especially offsuit with a 5 kicker. This is not a premium hand by any means.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (big blind) facing a raise from the SB (seat 2). I'll be out of position postflop.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at seat 2's actions:\n   - Hand 30: raised to 24 preflop\n   - Hand 31: folded preflop  \n   - Hand 32: called 29 preflop, then bet 45 on flop and folded\n   - Hand 33: raised to 12, then 3-bet to 120 preflop, checked flop, folded turn\n   - Hand 34: folded preflop\n   \n   This opponent seems somewhat aggressive but not wildly so. They've shown some willingness to raise and 3-bet preflop.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - My stack: 225 chips (56.2 BB)\n   - Opponent (seat 2): Stack size isn't shown but they posted SB 2 and raised 8 total, so they have at least 8 chips\n   - Pot: 12 chips currently (2 SB + 4 BB + 8 raise - but wait, seat 2 already posted SB 2, so they raised 8 more to total 10? Actually: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, SB raises to 8 total, so additional 6? Let me recalculate: SB already had 2 in, raises to 8 total, so additional 6. Pot = 2 (SB) + 4 (BB) + 6 (additional raise) = 12 chips. Amount to call is 4 more (since I already have 4 in as BB).\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 to win 12, so pot odds are 3:1 or 25%. With Q5o, I need to consider if I have at least 25% equity against opponent's range.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 56.2 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands.\n\n7. **My recent history**: I've been folding a lot (win rate 11.8%, folded 30 of 34 hands). Might be playing too tight.\n\nHowever, Q5o is just too weak to defend from the BB against a raise, even with good pot odds. The problem is:\n- Poor hand strength\n- Out of position\n- Weak kicker\n- No connectivity or suitedness\n\nEven with 3:1 pot odds, I'm likely dominated by many hands in opponent's raising range. If they have any Q, they likely have a better kicker. If they have any pair, I'm behind. Only real value is if I hit two pair or trips.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. This is a standard fold with Q5o from BB facing a raise.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q5o is too weak to defend from BB against a raise.

This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the small blind, which is a terrible position to play marginal hands. I'll be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 223 chips (55.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. The raiser (Seat 2) has 0 chips? Wait, the player list shows \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\". But the action shows \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 12\". This seems contradictory. Let me check - if Seat 2 is out, they shouldn't be able to raise. Perhaps this is a display issue or they're actually still in? The action says they raised 12, so they must have chips.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n   - Hand 33: Raised to 12 preflop, then re-raised to 120\n   - Hand 35: Raised to 8 preflop\n   - This suggests they're raising with a range of hands, not just premium ones\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise). I need to call 10 to win 18, which gives me 1.8:1 odds or 35.7% pot odds. With 94o, I have nowhere near 35.7% equity against a raising range.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a decent stack relative to blinds (55.8 BB). There's no need to defend with such a weak hand from the worst position. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots.\n\n7. **Additional factors**: The BB (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) still has to act after me. They have 341 chips and could re-raise, putting me in an even worse spot.\n\nThis is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, position is terrible, and pot odds don't justify calling with such poor equity. Let me fold and wait for a better opportunity."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 4s 9c - This is a very weak hand, especially from the small blind. It's offsuit with low cards, no connectivity. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the small blind, which is a terrible position to play marginal hands. I'll be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 223 chips (55.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. The raiser (Seat 2) has 0 chips? Wait, the player list shows \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\". But the action shows \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 12\". This seems contradictory. Let me check - if Seat 2 is out, they shouldn't be able to raise. Perhaps this is a display issue or they're actually still in? The action says they raised 12, so they must have chips.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n   - Hand 33: Raised to 12 preflop, then re-raised to 120\n   - Hand 35: Raised to 8 preflop\n   - This suggests they're raising with a range of hands, not just premium ones\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise). I need to call 10 to win 18, which gives me 1.8:1 odds or 35.7% pot odds. With 94o, I have nowhere near 35.7% equity against a raising range.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a decent stack relative to blinds (55.8 BB). There's no need to defend with such a weak hand from the worst position. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots.\n\n7. **Additional factors**: The BB (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) still has to act after me. They have 341 chips and could re-raise, putting me in an even worse spot.\n\nThis is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, position is terrible, and pot odds don't justify calling with such poor equity. Let me fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

I'll be out of position for the entire hand. The pot odds of 10 to win 18 (1.8:1) require about 35.7% equity, and 94o doesn't have that against most raising ranges.\n\nAlso, the big blind still has to act behind me with 341 chips, so I could face a re-raise.\n\nGiven my decent stack size (55.8 BB), there's no need to defend with such a weak hand.

So it's folded to me on the button. I can call 4, raise, or fold.\n\nMy hand: A4o is a marginal hand. Ace-rag offsuit is generally weak, but being on the button with position makes it playable. However, I need to consider the opponents still to act: the SB (Seat 4) and BB (Seat 1).\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been raising preflop frequently (7 times in recent hands), with raises ranging from 6 to 40. They seem aggressive.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) also raises frequently (9 times), with raises from 4 to 16. They've shown hands like KK, QsKs, 66, A5s, JQo.\n\nMy own history shows I've been folding a lot (32 folds out of 36 hands, only 4 wins). I have 55.8 BB, which is a healthy stack but not huge.\n\nConsidering position: Being on the button is the best position. With A4o, I could consider raising to steal the blinds, but both blinds have shown they're willing to defend/3-bet. A small raise might get called by both blinds, putting me in a tricky spot postflop with a weak hand.\n\nIf I just call, I'm playing a multiway pot out of position (relative to the blinds who will act after me postflop) with a weak hand. That's not ideal.\n\nPot odds: Calling 4 into a pot of 6 gives me 1.5:1 odds, but with a weak hand, I need better implied odds.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack but not dominant. I should look for better spots.\n\nGiven A4o is weak and both blinds are aggressive, I think folding is correct. I could consider a small raise to 8-12, but if either blind re-raises, I'd have to fold, losing chips. If they call, I'm playing a pot with A4o out of position against likely better hands.\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger hand in this position. My stack is healthy enough to be patient."

However, I need to consider the opponents still to act: the SB (Seat 4) and BB (Seat 1).\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been raising preflop frequently (7 times in recent hands), with raises ranging from 6 to 40. They seem aggressive.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) also raises frequently (9 times), with raises from 4 to 16. They've shown hands like KK, QsKs, 66, A5s, JQo.\n\nMy own history shows I've been folding a lot (32 folds out of 36 hands, only 4 wins). I have 55.8 BB, which is a healthy stack but not huge.\n\nConsidering position: Being on the button is the best position. With A4o, I could consider raising to steal the blinds, but both blinds have shown they're willing to defend/3-bet. A small raise might get called by both blinds, putting me in a tricky spot postflop with a weak hand.\n\nIf I just call, I'm playing a multiway pot out of position (relative to the blinds who will act after me postflop) with a weak hand. That's not ideal.\n\nPot odds: Calling 4 into a pot of 6 gives me 1.5:1 odds, but with a weak hand, I need better implied odds.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack but not dominant. I should look for better spots.\n\nGiven A4o is weak and both blinds are aggressive, I think folding is correct. I could consider a small raise to 8-12, but if either blind re-raises, I'd have to fold, losing chips. If they call, I'm playing a pot with A4o out of position against likely better hands.\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger hand in this position. My stack is healthy enough to be patient.",

I need to make a decision and output that JSON.\n\nI was analyzing the hand: I'm on the button with Ah 4c, 223 chips (55.8 BB). Blinds are 2/4. Action folded to me. I can call 4, raise, or fold. I was leaning toward fold based on my analysis. Let me finalize.\n\nReasons to fold: A4o is weak, both blinds are aggressive and likely to defend/3-bet, I'm out of position postflop relative to blinds, my stack is healthy enough to wait for better spots.\n\nReasons to raise: Position advantage, could steal blinds, but blinds are aggressive so might not work.\n\nReasons to call: Cheap to see flop, but then I'm playing a multiway pot with weak hand out of position.\n\nI think fold is correct. So I should output JSON with action: \"fold\", raise_to: null, and a brief reasoning.\n\nWait, but \"fold\" is an action. Actually, looking at the prompt: \"When you decide on an action, respond with a JSON object in this exact format: { \"action\": \"fold\" | \"check\" | \"call\" | \"raise\", \"raise_to\": <number if raising, otherwise null>, \"reasoning\": \"<brief explanation of your decision>\" }\".

Now it's my action with 0 to call (since I already posted BB of 4). Pot is 10 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 4 limp).\n\n**My hand:** K7s is a weak hand. King-high with weak kicker, suited but still marginal. In BB defense situations, we can defend wider, but K7o is pretty weak.\n\n**Position:** I'm out of position (BB) against one limper. This is not ideal as I'll have to act first on every street.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 219 chips (54.8 BB), MiniMax has 351 chips. I'm not short-stacked.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** From the recall, MiniMax-M2 seems to limp/call frequently preflop (hands 32, 33, 36). They folded to raises in some spots. They seem to play somewhat passively preflop.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have a decent stack, not desperate. Should preserve chips but also look for opportunities.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. K7s is weak but playable in BB defense\n2. Only one limper, so pot is small\n3. I'm out of position\n4. MiniMax seems passive preflop\n5. If I check, I'll see a flop for free (already invested 4 chips)\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check:** See flop for free, evaluate. Probably best with this weak hand.\n- **Raise:** Could try to steal the pot, but with K7s and out of position against a limper who might call, raising seems spewy.\n- **Fold:** Not possible (check is available).\n\nGiven the situation, checking seems optimal. I get to see a flop for free with a hand that has some potential (suited, could hit top pair with K). If I hit something, I can continue; if not, I can easily fold.\n\nI should check and see the flop.",

The pot is 10 chips, and it's checked to me on the flop. I have 219 chips (54.8 BB). The only opponent left is MiniMax-M2 with 351 chips.\n\nLooking at the opponent data: MiniMax-M2 has been fairly active preflop, raising frequently. On hand #32, they called 25 preflop (which seems like a big blind call), then check-raised on the flop from 90. That suggests they can be aggressive post-flop.\n\nMy hand is weak: King-high with no pair, no draws. The board has an Ace and Jack, which likely hits many of MiniMax-M2's calling range. Given they just called preflop (not raised), they could have a wide range including suited connectors, small pairs, or Ace-rag hands.\n\nWith this board texture (As Jd 5c), my K-high is likely behind. Even if I had a king, I'd be behind any Ace, Jack, or pair. The pot is only 10 chips, so not much to fight for.\n\nGiven my tournament stack of 54.8 BB, I should be cautious with weak hands. I have position advantage (acting last on flop), but with such a weak hand, checking seems best. I could consider a small bluff bet since the board might have missed both players, but with an Ace on board and opponent having called preflop, they likely have something.\n\nBetter to check and see what happens on the turn. If opponent bets, I can easily fold. If opponent checks behind, I get a free card and might improve.\n\nI'll check.",

Opponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has 351 chips. The hand has been very passive so far: preflop SB folded, we checked BB, seat 4 just called. On the flop, both checked.\n\nOur hand is weak: K-high with 7 kicker, no pair, no draw. We have a backdoor straight draw (need 8 and 9 for a straight, but board has A, J, 5, 6 - that's not really a draw). Actually, we have a gutshot straight draw to a T (if a T comes, we'd have K-high straight? Wait: Board: As Jd 5c 6c, we have 7s Kh. We need 8-9-T for a straight? Actually: 5-6-7-8-9 would be a straight, but we have 7 and board has 5,6, so we need 8 and 9. That's a double gutter? Actually 4-8 would also give us 4-5-6-7-8 straight. So we have some straight possibilities but very remote.\n\nThe opponent's range: They limped preflop from UTG+1 (seat 4), then checked flop. They could have a wide range of hands - small pairs, suited connectors, weak aces, etc. Their check on the flop suggests weakness or they're slowplaying.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've shown some aggression (hand 32 they raised on flop with Ad5d on 9c8s7s board). They've shown down decent hands: KK, 66, Ad5d, JQ. They seem to play reasonably.\n\nPot is only 10 chips. We have position (we act first on turn). With such a weak hand, checking seems best. If we bet, we're bluffing with very little equity. If checked to us on river, we might consider a bluff if opponent shows weakness again.\n\nGiven the tiny pot and our weak hand, checking is the standard play. We can see what opponent does on river. If they bet, we'll likely fold. If they check, we might consider a small bluff on river if we think they're weak.\n\nActually, wait: We're in the BB, so we acted first preflop? Actually preflop: SB posted, we posted BB, seat 4 called, SB folded, we checked. So we have position postflop (seat 4 acts after us). On turn, we act first.\n\nChecking seems correct. No need to bluff into such a small pot with a hand that has some showdown value (K-high might be best if opponent has complete air). We can check and evaluate river."

Opponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has 351 chips. The hand has been very passive so far: preflop SB folded, we checked BB, seat 4 just called. On the flop, both checked.\n\nOur hand is weak: K-high with 7 kicker, no pair, no draw. We have a backdoor straight draw (need 8 and 9 for a straight, but board has A, J, 5, 6 - that's not really a draw). Actually, we have a gutshot straight draw to a T (if a T comes, we'd have K-high straight? Wait: Board: As Jd 5c 6c, we have 7s Kh. We need 8-9-T for a straight? Actually: 5-6-7-8-9 would be a straight, but we have 7 and board has 5,6, so we need 8 and 9. That's a double gutter? Actually 4-8 would also give us 4-5-6-7-8 straight. So we have some straight possibilities but very remote.\n\nThe opponent's range: They limped preflop from UTG+1 (seat 4), then checked flop. They could have a wide range of hands - small pairs, suited connectors, weak aces, etc. Their check on the flop suggests weakness or they're slowplaying.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've shown some aggression (hand 32 they raised on flop with Ad5d on 9c8s7s board). They've shown down decent hands: KK, 66, Ad5d, JQ. They seem to play reasonably.\n\nPot is only 10 chips. We have position (we act first on turn). With such a weak hand, checking seems best. If we bet, we're bluffing with very little equity. If checked to us on river, we might consider a bluff if opponent shows weakness again.\n\nGiven the tiny pot and our weak hand, checking is the standard play. We can see what opponent does on river. If they bet, we'll likely fold. If they check, we might consider a small bluff on river if we think they're weak.\n\nActually, wait: We're in the BB, so we acted first preflop? Actually preflop: SB posted, we posted BB, seat 4 called, SB folded, we checked. So we have position postflop (seat 4 acts after us). On turn, we act first.\n\nChecking seems correct. No need to bluff into such a small pot with a hand that has some showdown value (K-high might be best if opponent has complete air). We can check and evaluate river.",

The board is A J 5 6 8. There's no flush possible (two clubs, but not three of same suit). The board has straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9, but I only have 7, so I don't have a straight. My hand is essentially King-high, which is very weak on this board.\n\n**Betting history:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 limped (called), I checked from BB\n- Flop: Both checked\n- Turn: Both checked\n- River: Action is on me, no bet yet\n\n**Opponent analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the data, MiniMax-M2 has shown various betting patterns:\n- Sometimes aggressive with bets on flop/turn\n- Has raised preflop several times\n- Has called and limped in various spots\n- Has checked rivers before (Hand #23)\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 10 chips, I can check for free or bet. If I bet, I risk chips to win 10.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 219 chips (54.8 BB), which is a decent stack. MiniMax-M2 has 351 chips. I'm not in danger of blinding out.\n\n**Decision reasoning:**\n1. My hand is very weak - King-high on an Ace-high board\n2. Opponent checked flop and turn, suggesting weakness\n3. However, any Ace, Jack, pair, or even Queen-high beats me\n4. The pot is small (10 chips)\n5. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands\n6. If I check, I might win if opponent also has nothing\n7. Given opponent's tendency to sometimes bet when they have something, their check on both streets suggests weakness\n\nI should check and hope my King-high is good. Betting with this weak hand would be a bluff, but the board is dry and opponent might call with any pair. The pot is too small to risk chips.\n\n**Final decision:** Check and hope to win with King-high."

The board is A J 5 6 8. There's no flush possible (two clubs, but not three of same suit). The board has straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9, but I only have 7, so I don't have a straight. My hand is essentially King-high, which is very weak on this board.\n\n**Betting history:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 limped (called), I checked from BB\n- Flop: Both checked\n- Turn: Both checked\n- River: Action is on me, no bet yet\n\n**Opponent analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the data, MiniMax-M2 has shown various betting patterns:\n- Sometimes aggressive with bets on flop/turn\n- Has raised preflop several times\n- Has called and limped in various spots\n- Has checked rivers before (Hand #23)\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 10 chips, I can check for free or bet. If I bet, I risk chips to win 10.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 219 chips (54.8 BB), which is a decent stack. MiniMax-M2 has 351 chips. I'm not in danger of blinding out.\n\n**Decision reasoning:**\n1. My hand is very weak - King-high on an Ace-high board\n2. Opponent checked flop and turn, suggesting weakness\n3. However, any Ace, Jack, pair, or even Queen-high beats me\n4. The pot is small (10 chips)\n5. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands\n6. If I check, I might win if opponent also has nothing\n7. Given opponent's tendency to sometimes bet when they have something, their check on both streets suggests weakness\n\nI should check and hope my King-high is good. Betting with this weak hand would be a bluff, but the board is dry and opponent might call with any pair. The pot is too small to risk chips.\n\n**Final decision:** Check and hope to win with King-high.",

On the button, I have position advantage. With only 2 chips to call into a 6-chip pot, I'm getting 3:1 pot odds preflop.\n\nMy recent history shows I've been folding a lot (win rate 13%, folded 33 of 38 hands). I need to play more hands, especially in position.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 56.8 BB, I have room to be selective but should defend my blinds and play positionally.\n\n**Decision:** 6\u26654\u2665 is marginal but playable on the button with only 2 chips to call. The pot odds are good (3:1). I have position, which is valuable. Folding seems too tight given the price. Raising doesn't make sense with this weak hand.\n\nI should call and see a flop. If I hit a draw or pair, I can continue. If not, I can fold cheaply.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Suited connector on button with position, getting 3:1 pot odds.

I want to see a turn card for free and potentially improve. If I improve to two pair or better, I can consider betting. If opponent bets on turn, I can easily fold with this marginal hand.\n\nChecking allows me to:\n1. See a free turn card\n2. Avoid bloating a small pot with a weak hand\n3. Use my position to react to opponent's actions\n\nI should not bet here because:\n- My hand is too weak for value\n- Opponent likely folds most hands that don't connect with this flop\n- If called, I'm usually behind\n- No fold equity against any pair or draw\n\nLet me check and see what happens on the turn.",

Pot is small (8 chips)\n2. My hand is marginal\n3. Opponent is passive\n4. I have position\n\nGiven the small pot and my marginal hand, raising seems unnecessary and could inflate the pot with a weak hand. Checking seems reasonable to see a free river and potentially improve. If I check, opponent might check behind, and we see a free river. If I bet, I might get called by better hands or fold out worse hands (though there aren't many worse hands that would call).\n\nActually, let me think about this more strategically. With bottom pair on a dry board, I could consider a small bet for value/protection. But what hands would call me that I beat? Possibly ace-high or worse pairs. But opponent likely has something if they're in the BB and didn't raise preflop. They could have a wide range.\n\nHowever, given the opponent's passive tendencies and the small pot, I think checking is fine. I can re-evaluate on the river.\n\n**Final Decision:** Check. Keep the pot small, see a free river, and potentially improve. If opponent bets on the river, I can re-evaluate based on bet size and board.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Bottom pair with weak kicker on dry board.

Small bet size suggests weakness or protection bet\n2. Good pot odds (25% equity needed)\n3. I have some showdown value with middle pair\n4. I have position on the river\n5. I have some straight outs (any 5 gives me a straight - 4 outs)\n6. Could improve to two pair or trips (2 more outs)\n\n**Estimated Equity:** With middle pair and 4 outs to a straight, plus some chance my pair is good, I likely have >25% equity against a weak range.\n\nGiven the small bet size, good pot odds, position, and some showdown value, I should call. Raising doesn't make sense with such a weak hand. Folding would be too tight given the price.\n\nI'll call and evaluate the river.",

They've mostly folded preflop, occasionally called. In hand #38, they checked down the entire hand (preflop call, then check-check-check). They don't seem aggressive postflop.\n\n**My hand strength:** Two pair is decent, but the river completed the flush. There are also straight possibilities (5-7 would make a straight, but board has 2-3-4-6-9). The flush is the main concern.\n\n**Possible opponent hands:**\n- Could have been betting a draw on turn (flush draw or straight draw)\n- Could have a pair + draw\n- Could have a made hand like a pair of 9s\n- Could be bluffing with missed draws\n\n**Decision:** Since amount to call is 0, I can check. But should I bet for value? Let me think:\n\n1. **Value bet considerations:** Two pair might be good here. Opponent might call with worse hands (one pair, worse two pair, maybe even a single 6 or 4).\n2. **Bluff considerations:** If opponent has a missed draw, they'll fold to a bet.\n3. **Check considerations:** If opponent has a flush, they'll bet when checked to. If they have a weak hand, they might check back.\n\nGiven the opponent's passive tendencies and the fact they bet small on the turn (half pot), they might not have a strong flush. A flush would likely bet bigger on turn or river. Their small bet suggests a medium strength hand or draw.\n\nI think a small value bet is reasonable. The pot is 16 chips. A bet of 8-10 chips (half pot) could get called by worse hands. If raised, I can fold.\n\nBut wait, I should consider tournament implications. I have 221 chips (55 BB), opponent has 343 chips. I'm not in danger of being short-stacked. A value bet here seems good.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: The board is 9d 3c 4c 2s 6c. The flush is clubs. My hand is 6h 4h. I have no clubs. So if opponent has any club, they have a flush. But would they call preflop with random clubs? Possibly, as BB defending wide.\n\nActually, thinking more: The turn was 2\u2660, making board 9\u2666 3\u2663 4\u2663 2\u2660. Opponent bet 4 into 8 pot. Then river 6\u2663 completes flush. So on turn, there was already a flush draw (two clubs). Opponent could have been betting a flush draw, which now got there.\n\nIf opponent had a flush draw on turn, they now have a flush. If they had a pair + flush draw, they now have a flush. So betting might be risky.\n\nBut they might also have a straight draw (5-7) or a pair of 9s, or a weak hand like A9.\n\nI think checking is safer. If I check and they bet, I can decide whether to call based on bet size. If they check back, I win the pot with two pair.\n\nActually, let me check the pot odds if they bet. Pot is 16. If they bet 8 (half pot), I need 8 to win 24, so 25% equity. If they have a flush, I have 0% equity. If they have one pair, I have ~90% equity. So I need to be right about 25% of the time.\n\nGiven opponent's passivity and small turn bet, I think checking and calling a reasonable bet (up to maybe 12 chips) is okay. But if they bet big, I should fold.\n\nActually, I think the best play is to check and evaluate their bet. This gives me more information and controls the pot size.\n\n**Final decision:** Check.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\nI'm on the river with 6h4h, board is 9d 3c 4c 2s 6c. I have two pair: sixes and fours. The river completed a club flush draw (6c on river). The pot is 16 chips, amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy opponent (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) bet 4 on the turn (which was 2s after flop 9d 3c 4c). I called. Now on river, opponent hasn't acted yet - I'm first to act on river.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've shown some decent hands at showdown: KK, 66, A5 suited, JQ, and 34 suited. They seem to play somewhat tight but not extremely so. They bet small on the turn (4 into 12 pot, 1/3 pot bet). This could be a value bet with a hand like a pair, or a draw.\n\nMy hand: Two pair is decent, but the flush got there. I have no clubs. Possible hands that beat me: any club flush (A high, K high, Q high, etc.), any straight (though board shows 9-3-4-2-6, so straight would need 5-7 or A-5, but 5-7 would be 5-6-7-8-9, not possible with this board; A-5 would be A-2-3-4-5, also not possible). Actually, looking at board: 9d 3c 4c 2s 6c. Possible straights: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 5,7,8) - not on board. A-2-3-4-5 (needs A,5) - not on board. So no straight possible.\n\nSo only flushes beat me. My opponent could have been betting a flush draw on turn that got there. Or they could have a pair and be betting for value.\n\nSince I'm first to act, I should consider betting for value against weaker hands like one pair, but also consider that if I bet and get raised, I'm in a tough spot. Checking might induce a bluff from missed draws or get value from worse hands that might bet.\n\nGiven the small pot (16 chips) and my stack (221 chips, 55 BB), I think checking is reasonable. If opponent checks behind, I still win with two pair. If they bet, I can evaluate based on bet size.\n\nLet me check.",

It's folded to me on the button.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression (raised to 40 in hand 33, raised to 8 in hand 34). Shows 9-8 suited/offsuit holdings in showdowns. Has folded the last few hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Seems to play fairly passively - calls and checks often. Showed 66, A5s, JQo, 43s, K6o in showdowns.\n\nMy position on the button is excellent. With pocket 7s, this is a medium pocket pair that plays well in position. I have 59 BB stack, which is healthy but not huge.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Pocket 7s is a hand that wants to see a flop cheaply and try to hit a set (about 12% chance). If I don't hit a set, it's often easy to fold.\n2. Being on the button gives me positional advantage postflop.\n3. The SB (seat 4) seems passive and may just complete if I call.\n4. The BB (seat 1) has shown aggression but has folded several recent hands.\n\nOptions:\n- Fold: Too conservative with a medium pocket pair on the button\n- Call: Standard play - see a flop cheaply, try to hit a set\n- Raise: Could be good to take initiative, but pocket 7s doesn't play great as a raise if called\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies and my position, calling seems optimal. I get to see a flop for cheap with good implied odds if I hit a set. Raising might fold out the blinds, but if called, I'm OOP against at least one player (SB would act before me postflop since he's in the blinds). Actually wait, I'm on the button, so I'd have position on everyone postflop. But still, pocket 7s doesn't want to build a big pot preflop without hitting a set.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips, I need to call 4. That's good pot odds (2:1). With implied odds if I hit a set, calling is good.\n\nI should call."

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 2, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB 4. It's folded to me on the button.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression (raised to 40 in hand 33, raised to 8 in hand 34). Shows 9-8 suited/offsuit holdings in showdowns. Has folded the last few hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Seems to play fairly passively - calls and checks often. Showed 66, A5s, JQo, 43s, K6o in showdowns.\n\nMy position on the button is excellent. With pocket 7s, this is a medium pocket pair that plays well in position. I have 59 BB stack, which is healthy but not huge.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Pocket 7s is a hand that wants to see a flop cheaply and try to hit a set (about 12% chance). If I don't hit a set, it's often easy to fold.\n2. Being on the button gives me positional advantage postflop.\n3. The SB (seat 4) seems passive and may just complete if I call.\n4. The BB (seat 1) has shown aggression but has folded several recent hands.\n\nOptions:\n- Fold: Too conservative with a medium pocket pair on the button\n- Call: Standard play - see a flop cheaply, try to hit a set\n- Raise: Could be good to take initiative, but pocket 7s doesn't play great as a raise if called\n\nGiven the opponent tendencies and my position, calling seems optimal. I get to see a flop for cheap with good implied odds if I hit a set. Raising might fold out the blinds, but if called, I'm OOP against at least one player (SB would act before me postflop since he's in the blinds). Actually wait, I'm on the button, so I'd have position on everyone postflop. But still, pocket 7s doesn't want to build a big pot preflop without hitting a set.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips, I need to call 4. That's good pot odds (2:1). With implied odds if I hit a set, calling is good.\n\nI should call.",

The pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + my call 4 + BB raise 8). I need to call 8 more.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising preflop quite often (7 times in the data I see). Their raises range from 6 to 40 chips. They've shown down hands like 9-8 suited, 9-8 offsuit - so they're playing somewhat loose. They raised to 12 in hand 21 and hand 31.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 7s is a medium pocket pair. It plays well in position (I'm on the button). Against a single opponent, this is a decent hand to continue with, especially in position.\n\nStack sizes: I have 233 chips (58 BB), opponent has 330 chips (82.5 BB). The raise is small relative to stacks.\n\nPosition: I have position advantage - I'm on the button, will act last postflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 18 (current pot) + 8 (my call) = 26. That's about 1:2.25 odds (31% equity needed). Pocket 7s vs a reasonable raising range has around 40-45% equity, so pot odds are favorable.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm not desperate for chips, but not huge either. Winning this pot would be nice.\n\nGiven the small raise size, my position advantage, and favorable pot odds, calling seems reasonable. Raising could also be considered to take initiative, but pocket 7s doesn't love facing a 3-bet, and the opponent might call with many hands that have good equity against us.\n\nLooking at my recent history: I've been folding a lot (33 folds out of 39 hands). I've won 2 small pots recently. Might be good to play a bit more aggressively.\n\nHowever, let me consider: If I call, the pot will be 26 chips. My stack is 225 after calling (233-8). That's still deep relative to the pot.\n\nI think calling is the standard play here. Folding would be too tight given the odds and position. Raising could be okay but might get us into trouble if opponent has a strong hand.\n\nLet's call."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI have pocket 7s on the button. I initially called the BB of 4, then the BB (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 12 total (8 more to call). The pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + my call 4 + BB raise 8). I need to call 8 more.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising preflop quite often (7 times in the data I see). Their raises range from 6 to 40 chips. They've shown down hands like 9-8 suited, 9-8 offsuit - so they're playing somewhat loose. They raised to 12 in hand 21 and hand 31.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 7s is a medium pocket pair. It plays well in position (I'm on the button). Against a single opponent, this is a decent hand to continue with, especially in position.\n\nStack sizes: I have 233 chips (58 BB), opponent has 330 chips (82.5 BB). The raise is small relative to stacks.\n\nPosition: I have position advantage - I'm on the button, will act last postflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 18 (current pot) + 8 (my call) = 26. That's about 1:2.25 odds (31% equity needed). Pocket 7s vs a reasonable raising range has around 40-45% equity, so pot odds are favorable.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm not desperate for chips, but not huge either. Winning this pot would be nice.\n\nGiven the small raise size, my position advantage, and favorable pot odds, calling seems reasonable. Raising could also be considered to take initiative, but pocket 7s doesn't love facing a 3-bet, and the opponent might call with many hands that have good equity against us.\n\nLooking at my recent history: I've been folding a lot (33 folds out of 39 hands). I've won 2 small pots recently. Might be good to play a bit more aggressively.\n\nHowever, let me consider: If I call, the pot will be 26 chips. My stack is 225 after calling (233-8). That's still deep relative to the pot.\n\nI think calling is the standard play here. Folding would be too tight given the odds and position. Raising could be okay but might get us into trouble if opponent has a strong hand.\n\nLet's call.",

The BB raised to 12 total, making it 8 more for me to call. Pot is 18 chips. I have position. The opponent seems to raise frequently. Pot odds: I need to call 8 to win 26 total (18+8), so I need about 31% equity. Pocket 7s has that against most ranges.\n\nGiven my position advantage and the small raise size, calling seems best. I could consider raising, but pocket 7s doesn't play well against a 3-bet, and I'd prefer to see a flop cheaply and potentially hit a set or play postflop with position.\n\nSo I'll call. My response should be:\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 7s has good equity against opponent's likely raising range.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I have 7s7h on a Jc Ts 2c board. I'm on the button. The opponent (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised preflop from the BB to 12 total, I called. Now on the flop, opponent bets 16 into a pot of 42. I need to call 16 to win 58 (42+16). That's about 3.6:1 pot odds.\n\nMy hand: Middle pair with 7s. The board has Jc Ts 2c - two clubs, straight draws possible. My 7s are basically a bluff catcher here. The opponent could have a wide range: could be continuation betting with overcards, could have a jack, could have a draw, could have a ten, could have a bigger pair.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: They've been fairly active preflop with raises. On the flop, they've bet a few times (hand 12, 20) and raised once (hand 26). They seem to be aggressive.\n\nMy stack: 225 chips (56 BB) - decent but not huge. Opponent has 314 chips.\n\nGiven the board texture and my hand strength, I'm likely behind if opponent has any piece of this board. My 7s are vulnerable to overcards on turn/river. The flush draw and straight draws make this a dangerous board to continue with a marginal hand.\n\nHowever, I have position, which is valuable. The pot odds are decent (3.6:1). I need about 21% equity to call. Against a range of top pair, overpairs, draws, and some bluffs, I might have around 30-40% equity. But my hand has little improvement potential - only hitting a 7 (2 outs) or backdoor straight/flush possibilities.\n\nConsidering tournament implications: I have 56 BB, which is healthy. Folding here preserves my stack. Calling could lead to difficult decisions on future streets.\n\nLooking at opponent's flop betting: In hand 12 they bet 16 on flop (similar bet size). In hand 20 they bet 8 on flop (smaller). In hand 26 they raised on flop (aggressive).\n\nGiven the board texture (Jc Ts 2c) is quite coordinated with flush and straight draws, opponent might be betting with a wide range including draws. But my hand is weak and I'm out of position for the rest of the hand (actually I'm on button, so I have position - that's good).\n\nWait, I'm on the button, so I have position! That's actually a significant advantage. I can call and see a turn, then decide.\n\nBut my hand is really weak. Middle pair with bad kicker on a wet board. If I call, I'm likely calling again on turn if checked to, or facing another bet.\n\nI think the prudent play is to fold. The pot is small relative to my stack, and I'm likely behind or in a vulnerable spot. Better to wait for a better spot.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors: The opponent raised preflop from BB after I limped. Their range could be strong. They're now betting flop. This could be a standard continuation bet with a wide range, but my hand isn't strong enough to continue.\n\nI'll fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with Qs Jd. The SB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has just limped (called the BB). The pot is 16 chips (8 from me as BB, 4 from SB as SB, plus SB called additional 4). I have 217 chips (27.1 BB). Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nFrom the opponent action history, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been fairly active:\n- Hand 33: Called preflop with 80 chips (that seems like a big call)\n- Hand 34: Raised preflop to 8\n- Hand 40: Raised preflop to 12\n- Multiple folds in between\n\nThey seem to be playing a mixed strategy - sometimes raising, sometimes limping (like this hand), sometimes folding. The limp here from SB could indicate a weaker hand, as stronger hands might raise.\n\nMy hand: QJo is a decent hand from the BB. It's suited connectors (offsuit actually), but QJ is a strong enough hand to play heads-up against a SB limp. \n\nPosition: I'm out of position (BB vs SB), which is a disadvantage, but heads-up this is less severe.\n\nStack sizes: I have 217 chips (27.1 BB), opponent has 348 chips (43.5 BB). I'm slightly shorter stacked.\n\nOptions:\n1. Check: Play the hand for free, see a flop. This is safe but gives up initiative.\n2. Raise: Take control of the hand. A standard raise here would be to 24-32 chips (3-4x). \n\nConsidering the opponent's limp, they likely have a weak to medium hand. Raising could take it down preflop, or build a pot with a decent hand. QJo plays well heads-up.\n\nI should consider raising to about 24-28 chips. Let's say 24 chips (raising to 24 total, which is 16 more chips).\n\nThis is a good spot to raise for value and to take initiative. The opponent's limp suggests weakness, and I have position postflop (actually wait, I'm BB, SB acts first postflop, so I have position on the flop? Actually in heads-up, SB acts first preflop, but postflop the order is different. In heads-up, the BB acts first on flop, turn, river except preflop. So I'm out of position postflop. That's a consideration.)\n\nActually in heads-up: Preflop: SB acts first, BB last. Postflop: BB acts first on each street. So I'm out of position postflop. That makes checking more attractive.\n\nBut with QJo against a likely weak range, raising still has merit. I'll raise to 24.",

With 28.6 BB stack, better to preserve chips for stronger spots rather than play a speculative hand that could lead to difficult postflop decisions.

I've already posted the small blind of 4 chips, and the big blind (MiniMax-M2) has posted 8 chips. Seat 1 folded. So I need to decide whether to fold, call the additional 4 chips, or raise.\n\nKey factors:\n1. Hand strength: J6o is a weak hand. Jack-high with no suitedness, no connectivity. Very speculative.\n2. Position: I'm on the button, which is the best position postflop. This gives me an advantage if I see a flop.\n3. Stack sizes: I have 229 chips (28.6 BB), opponent has 333 chips (41.6 BB). I'm shorter stacked.\n4. Opponent tendencies: From the data, MiniMax-M2 has folded preflop in hands 40 and 41. They called in hand 38 (when in BB facing a raise?). They seem somewhat tight recently. But this is limited data.\n5. Pot odds: I need to call 4 to win a pot of 12 (my 4 SB + BB 8). That's 3:1 pot odds, or 25% equity needed.\n6. Tournament considerations: I have 28.6 BB, which is decent but not huge. Need to be careful with marginal hands.\n\nJ6o has about 30-35% equity against a random hand preflop. Against a typical BB defending range (maybe 50-60% of hands), it might have 30-33% equity. The pot odds of 25% suggest calling could be marginally profitable if I play well postflop.\n\nHowever, raising is also an option. A button steal attempt could work given opponent's recent folds. But J6o is a very weak hand to raise with - if I get called or 3-bet, I'm in a tough spot.\n\nGiven my stack size (28.6 BB), I don't want to get too involved with such a weak hand. But the pot odds are good, and position helps.\n\nLooking at my recent history: I've been folding a lot (34 folds out of 41 hands). I won hand 41 with QJ from BB by raising. I might be getting too tight.\n\nI think the best play is to fold. J6o is just too weak, even with position. The 4 chips to call is small, but playing this hand postflop could lead to losing more chips when I hit marginal hands. Better to wait for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations: Only one opponent left (the BB). So heads-up situation. In heads-up, J6o is not terrible, but still weak.\n\nGiven everything, I'll fold.",

The board has an Ace, 7, 8 with two diamonds. My hand is very weak - I have no pair, no flush draw, no straight draw. Best case scenario is runner-runner for a straight or hitting a King.\n\n2. **Opponent tendencies:** From the recall data, MiniMax-M2 has shown:\n   - In hand #32, they called preflop, checked flop, then raised 90 on flop with Ad 5d (Ace with diamond draw)\n   - In hand #39, they bet small (4 chips) on turn with Kd 6s\n   - Generally seems to call preflop with various hands and can be aggressive postflop with draws or made hands\n\n3. **Bet sizing analysis:** Opponent bet 16 into 72 pot (about 22% pot). This is a small bet. Could be:\n   - A weak Ace trying to get value from worse\n   - A draw (flush draw or straight draw) \n   - A complete bluff\n\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 16 to win 88 (72 + 16). That's about 18% pot odds. I need roughly 18% equity to call.\n\n5. **My equity:** With King-high on this board, I have very little equity. Against a range of Ax, 7x, 8x, flush draws, straight draws - I'm probably around 10-15% equity at best.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** I have 25.6 BB stack, which is decent but not huge. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n7. **Position:** I'm on the button, which is good, but my hand is just too weak.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. The small bet size could be a probe bet, but with King-high and no draws, I don't have enough equity to continue. Even if opponent is bluffing, I have no way to improve on most turns. Better to wait for a better spot with my 25.6 BB stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"King-high with no draws on A-7-8 board.

The board has Q-K, so I'm behind any Q, K, or pair. My best outs are backdoor flush draw (hearts) and backdoor straight possibilities (need J-T or 9-8). Not a great hand on this board.\n\n2. **Opponent analysis**: From the recalled data, Kimi-K2 Thinking seems tight - folded preflop in 7 of 10 hands, raised once (hand #40), and called once. In hand #40, they raised preflop then bet the flop. This suggests they might be playing strong hands when they raise preflop.\n\n3. **Preflop action**: Opponent raised from SB to 16 total (min-raise), I called from BB. This is a standard call with A7o from BB getting good odds.\n\n4. **Flop situation**: Opponent checked. This could mean:\n   - They missed with a smaller pocket pair or suited connectors\n   - They have a weak hand like A-x and are giving up\n   - They're trapping with a strong hand (set, two pair, top pair)\n   - They have a draw and want to check-call\n\n5. **My options**:\n   - **Check**: See a free turn card. With my weak hand, this seems reasonable.\n   - **Bet**: Could try to take the pot down now with a bet, but risk getting raised or called by better hands.\n   - **Raise**: Not applicable since no bet to raise.\n\n6. **Stack preservation**: I have 23.6 BB, which is short but not desperate. The tournament is still early.\n\nGiven the board texture (Q-K-5 with two clubs), my Ace-high is likely not good. However, the opponent's check suggests weakness. A small bet could potentially win the pot, but if called, I'm likely behind and will have to give up on later streets.\n\nBetter to check and see the turn.

The board is Qc Kd 5c 9s. I have no pair, no draw. Best case scenario is I have Ace-high. There's a flush draw with clubs on board (Qc, 5c, plus 9s and Kd). I have no flush draw.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the data, Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised preflop frequently (9 times found). They've checked turn 3 times in past hands. No showdown data available. They raised preflop to 16 (min-raise from SB), which could be a wide range.\n\n**Pot odds and situation:**\nPot is 32 chips. I'm out of position. My hand is weak - just Ace-high. The opponent checked turn, which could indicate weakness or a trap. With Ace-high and no draws, I'm likely behind any pair. The K and Q on board are high cards that likely hit opponent's raising range.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have 23.6 BB, which is a decent stack but not huge. Being out of position with a weak hand suggests caution.\n\n**Possible actions:**\n1. Check: See a free river, but then face potential river bet.\n2. Bet: Try to take down pot now, but risk being called or raised.\n\nGiven my weak hand and out-of-position, checking seems prudent. If I bet and get called, I'm likely behind and will have to decide on river with no improvement. If I bet and get raised, I have to fold.\n\nThe pot is small relative to stacks. Checking keeps pot small and allows me to potentially bluff-catch on river if opponent shows weakness again.\n\nLet me check:{\"action\": \"check\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"Weak Ace-high hand with no draws, out of position.

They might also have a flush with AcXc.\n2. **Bluffs**: They checked flop and turn, so they might be betting a missed draw on the river as a bluff.\n\nMy hand is very weak - Ace-high on a board where many better hands exist. The pot odds: I need to call 24 to win 80 (56+24). That's 30% pot odds. I need to win at least 30% of the time to make this call profitable.\n\nConsidering opponent's play:\n- They raised preflop from SB, so their range includes many hands\n- They checked flop and turn, which could indicate weakness or slow-playing\n- River bet of 43% pot could be a value bet with medium strength or a bluff\n\nGiven my stack size (23.6 BB), this is a significant portion of my stack. I have 189 chips, and calling 24 would put me at 165 chips (20.6 BB). That's still playable but getting short.\n\nWhat bluffs could they have? Missed straight draws like T8, T7, or missed flush draws. But with the club flush draw getting there, if they had a flush draw, they might have bet earlier or might have made the flush.\n\nGiven the board texture and my weak hand, I think this is a fold. The opponent is likely to have at least a pair here, and Ace-high rarely wins at showdown on this board.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any history of this opponent bluffing rivers. The data shows they've bet rivers before, but without showdown information, I don't know if those were value bets or bluffs.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and pot odds, I think folding is correct. My hand has very little showdown value, and I can find better spots with my remaining stack."

They might also have a flush with AcXc.\n2. **Bluffs**: They checked flop and turn, so they might be betting a missed draw on the river as a bluff.\n\nMy hand is very weak - Ace-high on a board where many better hands exist. The pot odds: I need to call 24 to win 80 (56+24). That's 30% pot odds. I need to win at least 30% of the time to make this call profitable.\n\nConsidering opponent's play:\n- They raised preflop from SB, so their range includes many hands\n- They checked flop and turn, which could indicate weakness or slow-playing\n- River bet of 43% pot could be a value bet with medium strength or a bluff\n\nGiven my stack size (23.6 BB), this is a significant portion of my stack. I have 189 chips, and calling 24 would put me at 165 chips (20.6 BB). That's still playable but getting short.\n\nWhat bluffs could they have? Missed straight draws like T8, T7, or missed flush draws. But with the club flush draw getting there, if they had a flush draw, they might have bet earlier or might have made the flush.\n\nGiven the board texture and my weak hand, I think this is a fold. The opponent is likely to have at least a pair here, and Ace-high rarely wins at showdown on this board.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any history of this opponent bluffing rivers. The data shows they've bet rivers before, but without showdown information, I don't know if those were value bets or bluffs.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and pot odds, I think folding is correct. My hand has very little showdown value, and I can find better spots with my remaining stack.",

This is a terrible board for Ace-high. Any pair beats me. The board has straight and flush possibilities. The opponent checked flop and turn, then bet river. This could be a value bet with a medium pair (like Kx, Qx, Jx) or a missed draw bluff.\n\nGiven my stack size (189 chips, 23.6 BB), calling 24 chips (12.7% of my stack) is significant. I need to win at least 30% of the time to break even. With Ace-high on this board, I doubt I win 30% against a river bet.\n\nThe opponent raised preflop from SB, so their range includes many hands. They checked flop and turn, which could indicate weakness or slow-play. River bet could be trying to extract value from worse hands or bluffing a missed draw.\n\nBut what missed draws? Straight draws that missed would be hands like T8, T7, 86, etc. Flush draws that missed would be non-club hands. But with the club flush draw getting there, if they had a flush draw, they might have bet earlier or might have made the flush.\n\nI think this is a fold. My hand has very little showdown value. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nJSON response should be:\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Ace-high on this board has minimal showdown value.

With 30% pot odds needed and likely less than 30% equity, folding preserves stack for better opportunities.\"\n}\n\nWait, let me double-check the action sequence: Opponent raised preflop from SB to 16 (2x BB), I called from BB with A7o. Then opponent checked flop and turn, then bet river. This line could be a missed draw bluff, but also could be a slow-played strong hand.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and my stack size, I think fold is correct.",

The action: I posted SB 4, BB posted 8, and Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) just called 8. So I need to call 4 more to complete my SB.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression with raises preflop (hands 40 and 44), but here just called. From showdowns, they've played 98s type hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): In BB, will act after me. They've shown some loose calls (hand 43 called 20 preflop) and has shown down various hands from pairs to suited connectors.\n\nMy hand Q2o is terrible. Even from the SB, this is a fold in most situations. However, I'm getting 4:1 pot odds (pot is 20, I need to call 4). But postflop, I'll be out of position against 2 players, which makes playing this hand very difficult.\n\nMy stack is 185 (23.1 BB), which is short but not desperate. In tournament play with short stacks, I should be looking for better spots. The BB has a big stack and could easily raise if I just complete.\n\nConsidering tournament dynamics: I have 7 wins in 44 hands (16% win rate), so I've been relatively tight. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nThe fact that Seat 1 just called instead of raising might indicate weakness, but Q2o is still trash. Even if I hit a Q on flop, I could be dominated by better queens.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. The 4 chips I'd lose completing are better saved for when I have a real hand.\n\nDecision: Fold."

The action: I posted SB 4, BB posted 8, and Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) just called 8. So I need to call 4 more to complete my SB.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression with raises preflop (hands 40 and 44), but here just called. From showdowns, they've played 98s type hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): In BB, will act after me. They've shown some loose calls (hand 43 called 20 preflop) and has shown down various hands from pairs to suited connectors.\n\nMy hand Q2o is terrible. Even from the SB, this is a fold in most situations. However, I'm getting 4:1 pot odds (pot is 20, I need to call 4). But postflop, I'll be out of position against 2 players, which makes playing this hand very difficult.\n\nMy stack is 185 (23.1 BB), which is short but not desperate. In tournament play with short stacks, I should be looking for better spots. The BB has a big stack and could easily raise if I just complete.\n\nConsidering tournament dynamics: I have 7 wins in 44 hands (16% win rate), so I've been relatively tight. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nThe fact that Seat 1 just called instead of raising might indicate weakness, but Q2o is still trash. Even if I hit a Q on flop, I could be dominated by better queens.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. The 4 chips I'd lose completing are better saved for when I have a real hand.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm on the button with K7 offsuit. My stack is 185 chips (23.1 BB). The blinds are 4/8. The small blind (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) posted 4, and the big blind (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted 8. There are no other players in the hand - seats 2 and 5 are already folded.\n\nI need to decide whether to fold, call (limp), or raise. Looking at my hand history, I see I've played K7 before in hand #38 (BB position) and won a small pot by checking down. But that was from BB, not button.\n\nAnalyzing the hand: K7o is a weak hand. King-high with a weak kicker. However, I'm on the button with position advantage. The opponents are the small blind and big blind. Looking at opponent tendencies:\n\nKimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB): Has raised once preflop in hand #44, folded twice, and called once. Seems somewhat tight but not overly aggressive.\n\nMiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB): Has mostly folded or checked preflop. Called once against my raise in hand #43, then bet the flop.\n\nMy stack is 23 BB, which is getting short. In tournament poker, with 23 BB, I need to be looking for spots to accumulate chips. However, K7o is not a good hand to open with from the button. The standard play with 23 BB on the button would be to open-raise with a wider range, but K7o is borderline.\n\nConsidering pot odds: I need to call 8 chips into a pot of 12 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. That's decent, but I'd be playing out of position if I just call (the blinds would act after me postflop, but actually I'm on button so I have position postflop).\n\nBetter options:\n1. Fold - conservative play with a weak hand\n2. Raise - standard button open to 2.5-3x BB (20-24 chips)\n3. Call - limp in to see a cheap flop\n\nGiven my stack size (23 BB), I should be looking to open-raise with a reasonable range from the button. K7o is marginal but might be playable. However, looking at my recent history, I raised with Th Ks from button in hand #43 and lost. I also raised with 77 from button in hand #40 and had to fold on flop.\n\nThe safer play is to fold this weak hand and wait for a better spot. With 23 BB, I'm not desperate yet, but getting short. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nI'll fold.",

So it's heads-up between me and MiniMax-M2.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 177 chips (22.1 BB). MiniMax-M2 has 357 chips (44.6 BB). I'm the short stack at the table.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, MiniMax-M2 has been fairly passive preflop - mostly folding, occasionally calling, and only one instance of betting postflop (hand 43). They called a raise of 20 in hand 43 preflop, then bet 16 on the flop. This suggests they're not overly aggressive.\n\n5. **Current situation**: The pot is 20 chips (4+8+8). Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise. Minimum raise to 16 total (8 more).\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I'm the short stack with 22.1 BB. This is getting into push/fold territory. With QTs in the BB against one limper, this is a decent spot to potentially pick up the pot preflop or play a hand in position postflop.\n\n7. **Options**:\n   - **Check**: Take a free flop with QTs. This is safe but gives up initiative.\n   - **Raise**: Standard would be to raise to 24-32 total. This could win the pot preflop or get heads-up with initiative.\n\nGiven my stack size and the fact that MiniMax-M2 has shown some passivity, raising seems reasonable. QTs plays well heads-up, and I have position advantage postflop (since the action will go to me last on each street).\n\nA raise to 24-28 total (16-20 more) would be reasonable.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have 4d 3c - a very weak hand, suited connectors but not connected (43o)\n- Position: BTN (good position)\n- Stack: 193 chips (24.1 BB) - medium stack\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- Amount to call: 4 chips (half a small blind)\n- Only one opponent: MiniMax-M2 in BB with 349 chips\n\n**Opponent analysis from search:**\n- MiniMax-M2 seems to play somewhat straightforward\n- Has raised preflop multiple times (9 times found)\n- In recent hands, has folded to my raises (hand #47: folded to my 28 chip raise with Qh Th)\n- Has called raises preflop (hand #43: called my 24 chip raise)\n- Generally seems to play somewhat tight/passive\n\n**My situation:**\n- I'm the small blind, posted 4 chips\n- BB posted 8 chips\n- Only 4 more chips to call to see a flop\n- Pot odds: 4 to call into 12 pot = 3:1 odds (25% equity needed)\n\n**Hand strength considerations:**\n- 43o is a very weak hand\n- Even with position, this hand has poor equity against a random hand\n- Best case scenarios: flop two pair, trips, or a straight draw\n- Implied odds could be good if we hit a strong hand\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 24 BB, which is playable but not huge\n- Losing 4 chips is only 2% of my stack\n- If I fold, I lose my 4 chip SB anyway\n- Calling 4 more gives me a chance to win 12 chips\n\n**Decision:**\nThe pot odds are excellent (3:1), and I only need 25% equity. While 43o has only about 32% equity against a random hand, the implied odds could be decent if I hit something strong. With position, I can control the pot postflop. The cost is minimal (2% of stack).\n\nHowever, 43o is one of the worst possible hands. Even with good odds, playing such a weak hand can lead to difficult postflop decisions and potentially losing more chips. Given my stack size and tournament considerations, folding might be better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nLooking at my recent history: I've been raising with decent hands (KT, QTo) and winning pots preflop. This is a very marginal spot.\n\nI think the best play is to **fold**. The hand is too weak, and while the immediate pot odds are good, the reverse implied odds are poor - if I hit a marginal hand like a pair of 4s or 3s, I could lose a lot more chips. Better to wait for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand**: Ac Jc (suited AJ)\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - excellent position\n**Stack**: 193 chips (24.1 BB) - moderately short-stacked\n**Opponents**: \n- Seat 4 (SB): MiniMax-M2 with 357 chips, posted 4\n- Seat 1 (BB): Kimi-K2 Thinking with 360 chips, posted 8\n\n**Preflop action**: SB posted 4, BB posted 8. It's folded to me on the button.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: AJs is a strong hand, especially suited. It's a top 5% hand. From the button with no action yet, this is a clear raising hand.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is the best position. I can control the action post-flop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: At 24 BB, I'm getting into short-stack territory. Need to accumulate chips but also be careful about risking my stack.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB): Has shown some aggression (raised preflop in hand 44), but also folded the last two hands preflop. Might be playing tight.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has shown some loose calls (called 20 with A5s in hand 43), but also folds frequently. Has shown showdowns with marginal hands.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 24 BB, I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips. AJs on the button is definitely one of those spots.\n\n**Options**:\n- **Fold**: Too weak with AJs on button\n- **Call**: Could be okay but doesn't build the pot or take initiative\n- **Raise**: Standard play. Builds the pot, takes initiative, can win blinds uncontested.\n\n**Raise sizing**: Minimum raise to 16 (2x) or go slightly larger? With 24 BB stack, a 2.5x-3x raise is standard. Minimum raise to 16 is 2x BB. Given my stack size, I could raise to 20-24 (2.5x-3x). But with only 24 BB, I need to be careful about committing too much.\n\nActually, looking at my stack: 193 chips. If I raise to 20 (2.5x), that's 10.4% of my stack. If called, pot would be ~44, and I'd have 173 behind (21.6 BB). That's reasonable.\n\n**Decision**: Raise to 20-24. Let me go with 20 (2.5x) to keep some fold equity and not commit too much.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 20,\n  \"reasoning\": \"AJs on button is a strong raising hand. With 24 BB stack, need to accumulate chips. Standard 2.5x raise takes initiative, can win blinds uncontested, and maintains good stack-to-pot ratio if called.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm on the button with Ac Jc. I raised to 20 (2.5x BB). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) in the small blind 3-bet to 32 total (which is a raise of 12 more than my bet). Seat 1 (BB) folded. I need to call 12 more chips.\n\nCurrent pot: 60 chips (my 20 + SB's 32 + BB's 8)\nAmount to call: 12\nMy stack: 173 chips (21.6 BB)\n\nLooking at opponent history: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has shown some weak hands at showdown: Ad5d, JsQc, 3h4h, Kd6s, Td7d. They seem to play a wide range. They haven't shown many aggressive 3-bets from what I can see. This 3-bet from the small blind could be a squeeze play or a genuine strong hand.\n\nMy hand: AJo suited is a strong hand, but vulnerable to a 3-bet. Against a typical 3-bet range from the small blind, AJo has about 40% equity. However, given the opponent's shown wide range, they might be 3-betting lighter.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 12 to win 60, so I need 12/(60+12) = 12/72 = 16.7% equity. Even against a tight range, AJo has more than this.\n\nStack sizes: I have 173 chips (21.6 BB), opponent has 329 chips. If I call, pot will be 72 chips, and I'll have 161 chips left (20 BB). This gives me good implied odds if I hit a flop.\n\nPosition: I'm on the button, which is advantageous post-flop.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm short-stacked (21.6 BB), so I need to accumulate chips. Folding here would leave me with 173 chips, which is still playable but not ideal. Calling seems reasonable.\n\nHowever, I could also consider 4-betting. Minimum raise to 44 would put in 24 more chips. But with AJo and my stack size, 4-betting might commit me to the pot. If I 4-bet and get shoved on, I'd have to call with AJo, which might be marginal.\n\nGiven the pot odds and position, calling seems like the most balanced play. I'll see a flop and evaluate from there.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pot odds favorable (16.7% needed, AJo has >40% vs wide range). Position advantage on button. Opponent has shown wide range at showdown. Calling preserves stack flexibility and allows post-flop play with suited ace.\"\n}",

This is a very strong draw - any club gives me the nut flush. I also have an overcard (Ace) which could be good if opponent doesn't have AA/KK. I have approximately 12 outs (9 clubs + 3 Aces), giving me about 45% equity against a made hand.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the button, which is advantageous post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent Analysis:** From the data, MiniMax-M2 is quite aggressive preflop (9 raises in 48 hands). On the flop, they've bet 11 times out of 48 hands. Their 3-bet preflop suggests a strong range: likely pairs 99+, AK, AQ, maybe some suited connectors. The flop bet of 36 into 108 is a continuation bet sizing.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 108, I need to call 36. That's pot odds of 3:1 (25% equity needed). My flush draw alone gives me about 35% equity to hit by the river. With implied odds (if I hit my flush, I can win more on later streets), this is a profitable call.\n\n5. **Stack Sizes:** I have 161 total, opponent has 293. If I call, I'll have 125 left. The pot will be 180. This sets up potential turn decisions well.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I'm at 20.1 BB, which is short but not critical. Need to accumulate chips but also preserve stack.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold:** Too weak given my strong draw and good pot odds.\n- **Call:** Solid choice - see a turn card cheaply with good implied odds.\n- **Raise:** Could be considered as a semi-bluff. If I raise to ~120, I put pressure on opponent and could win immediately. However, with only 161 total, a raise commits me.\n\nGiven my stack size (161), if I raise to say 120, I'd be pot-committed. A better approach might be to call and evaluate turn. If I hit my flush, I can get more value. If I miss, I can decide based on opponent's action.\n\nThe flop is dry (5c 9d 2c), so opponent's range likely includes overpairs (TT+, maybe 99), AK, AQ. My flush draw is strong against this range.\n\n**Decision:** I'll call and see the turn. The pot odds justify it, and I have position advantage."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- My hand: Ac Jc (nut flush draw + overcard)\n- Board: 5c 9d 2c (rainbow with my flush draw)\n- Pot: 108 chips\n- To call: 36 chips\n- My stack: 161 chips (20.1 BB)\n- Opponent (Seat 4 - MiniMax-M2): 293 chips\n\n**Hand History:**\n- Preflop: I raised to 20 from BTN, MiniMax-M2 3-bet to 32 from SB, I called\n- Flop: MiniMax-M2 bets 36 (about 1/3 pot)\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength:** I have the nut flush draw with Ac Jc. This is a very strong draw - any club gives me the nut flush. I also have an overcard (Ace) which could be good if opponent doesn't have AA/KK. I have approximately 12 outs (9 clubs + 3 Aces), giving me about 45% equity against a made hand.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the button, which is advantageous post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent Analysis:** From the data, MiniMax-M2 is quite aggressive preflop (9 raises in 48 hands). On the flop, they've bet 11 times out of 48 hands. Their 3-bet preflop suggests a strong range: likely pairs 99+, AK, AQ, maybe some suited connectors. The flop bet of 36 into 108 is a continuation bet sizing.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 108, I need to call 36. That's pot odds of 3:1 (25% equity needed). My flush draw alone gives me about 35% equity to hit by the river. With implied odds (if I hit my flush, I can win more on later streets), this is a profitable call.\n\n5. **Stack Sizes:** I have 161 total, opponent has 293. If I call, I'll have 125 left. The pot will be 180. This sets up potential turn decisions well.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I'm at 20.1 BB, which is short but not critical. Need to accumulate chips but also preserve stack.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold:** Too weak given my strong draw and good pot odds.\n- **Call:** Solid choice - see a turn card cheaply with good implied odds.\n- **Raise:** Could be considered as a semi-bluff. If I raise to ~120, I put pressure on opponent and could win immediately. However, with only 161 total, a raise commits me.\n\nGiven my stack size (161), if I raise to say 120, I'd be pot-committed. A better approach might be to call and evaluate turn. If I hit my flush, I can get more value. If I miss, I can decide based on opponent's action.\n\nThe flop is dry (5c 9d 2c), so opponent's range likely includes overpairs (TT+, maybe 99), AK, AQ. My flush draw is strong against this range.\n\n**Decision:** I'll call and see the turn. The pot odds justify it, and I have position advantage.",

Pot odds: 36 to win 144 (108+36), so need ~25% equity. Flush draw has ~35% equity by river, plus overcard outs. Good pot odds.\n\nPosition: I'm on button, good for controlling pot.\n\nStack sizes: If I call, pot becomes 180, I have 125 left. Good implied odds if I hit flush.\n\nOpponent: 3-bet preflop, continuation bet on flop. Could have overpair or AK/AQ.\n\nOptions: fold (too weak), call (good), raise (semi-bluff but commits me).\n\nCall seems optimal. Let me check if I should consider raise. Raising to maybe 120 would be a strong semi-bluff. But with my stack, I'd have 41 left if called, essentially committed. Might be better to call and keep pot control.\n\nYes, call is best.

On this paired board (5c 9d 2c 5s), I have 9 outs for the flush (clubs). The Ace might be good sometimes but board is paired so could be up against a full house if opponent has a 5.\n\n2. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the data, MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression - bet on turn in hand 39, bet on flop in hand 43. This is their first 3-bet preflop that I've seen. They 3-bet from SB after my BTN raise, which could be a wide range.\n\n3. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 180, need to call 36. That's 5:1 pot odds (16.7% equity needed). My flush draw has ~18% equity to hit on river (9 outs). With implied odds if I hit, I could win more. But my stack is only 125 total, and I've already invested 20+12+36 = 68 chips.\n\n4. **Stack Size:** I have 125 chips total. After calling this 36, I'd have 89 left. If I miss river, I'm in a tough spot with only 89 chips.\n\n5. **Opponent's Range:** They 3-bet preflop, bet flop, bet turn. Could have: overpairs (99, 22, maybe TT-QQ), maybe A5s, maybe 9x with a 5, maybe bluffs. The turn 5 pairs the board, which reduces my Ace outs if they have a 5.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I'm short-stacked (15.6 BB). Need to accumulate chips. This is a decent spot with nut flush draw, but need to consider if I should raise instead of call.\n\n**Possible Actions:**\n- **Fold:** Too tight given pot odds and nut flush draw\n- **Call:** Reasonable, getting good pot odds for flush draw\n- **Raise:** Could go all-in (125 total). This would be a semi-bluff with flush draw + overcards. If they fold, we win 180 pot. If they call, we have decent equity.\n\nGiven my short stack and the fact that I'm getting good pot odds (5:1), calling seems reasonable. But raising all-in could also be good - it puts pressure on opponent and I have fold equity plus equity if called.\n\nLet me check if opponent has shown any folds to aggression."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: Ac Jc (nut flush draw, overcards)\n- Board: 5c 9d 2c 5s (paired board with flush draw)\n- Pot: 180 chips\n- To call: 36 chips\n- My stack: 125 chips (15.6 BB)\n- Opponent (MiniMax-M2): 257 chips, SB position\n\n**Hand History:**\n- Preflop: I raised to 20 (BTN), MiniMax-M2 3-bet to 32 from SB, I called 12\n- Flop: 5c 9d 2c, MiniMax-M2 bet 36, I called 36\n- Turn: 5s (board pairs), MiniMax-M2 bets 36 again\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** I have the nut flush draw (A-high flush draw) + overcards (Ace). On this paired board (5c 9d 2c 5s), I have 9 outs for the flush (clubs). The Ace might be good sometimes but board is paired so could be up against a full house if opponent has a 5.\n\n2. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the data, MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression - bet on turn in hand 39, bet on flop in hand 43. This is their first 3-bet preflop that I've seen. They 3-bet from SB after my BTN raise, which could be a wide range.\n\n3. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 180, need to call 36. That's 5:1 pot odds (16.7% equity needed). My flush draw has ~18% equity to hit on river (9 outs). With implied odds if I hit, I could win more. But my stack is only 125 total, and I've already invested 20+12+36 = 68 chips.\n\n4. **Stack Size:** I have 125 chips total. After calling this 36, I'd have 89 left. If I miss river, I'm in a tough spot with only 89 chips.\n\n5. **Opponent's Range:** They 3-bet preflop, bet flop, bet turn. Could have: overpairs (99, 22, maybe TT-QQ), maybe A5s, maybe 9x with a 5, maybe bluffs. The turn 5 pairs the board, which reduces my Ace outs if they have a 5.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I'm short-stacked (15.6 BB). Need to accumulate chips. This is a decent spot with nut flush draw, but need to consider if I should raise instead of call.\n\n**Possible Actions:**\n- **Fold:** Too tight given pot odds and nut flush draw\n- **Call:** Reasonable, getting good pot odds for flush draw\n- **Raise:** Could go all-in (125 total). This would be a semi-bluff with flush draw + overcards. If they fold, we win 180 pot. If they call, we have decent equity.\n\nGiven my short stack and the fact that I'm getting good pot odds (5:1), calling seems reasonable. But raising all-in could also be good - it puts pressure on opponent and I have fold equity plus equity if called.\n\nLet me check if opponent has shown any folds to aggression.",

That's 5:1 odds. My flush draw has about 18% chance to hit on river (9/46 \u2248 19.6%). Actually 9 outs out of 46 unknown cards = 19.6%. So pot odds are good - I need 16.7% equity, I have ~19.6% just for flush. Plus some chance Ace is good, though board is paired so Ace might not be clean outs.\n\nBut I also have to consider my stack size: 125 total. If I call, I'll have 89 left on river. If I miss, I'll be in tough spot with only 89 chips (11 BB). \n\nOpponent bet 36 into 180 pot - that's a small bet (20% pot). Could be trying to get value from weaker hands or continuation bet. The turn card (5s) pairs the board, which could slow down some hands but they still bet same size.\n\nGiven my short stack and tournament situation, I think calling is reasonable. Raising all-in is also possible as a semi-bluff, but I'm getting good direct pot odds to just call.\n\nActually, let me calculate: If I call 36, pot becomes 216. I have 89 left. If I hit flush on river, I can potentially get the rest of my stack in. So implied odds are decent.\n\nI think calling is the best play here. Let me respond with JSON.",

          "content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with Ac Jc. Board: 5c 9d 2c 5s Ah. I have top pair with ace kicker and a flush draw that missed (only one club on board). Actually board shows 5c, 9d, 2c, 5s, Ah. So there are two clubs: 5c and 2c. I have Ac Jc, so I have ace-high flush draw that didn't come in. But I have top pair with ace, and the board paired fives. So I have Aces with jack kicker, but there's a possible full house (someone could have a five). Opponent bet 36 on river after betting 36 on flop and turn.\n\nMy stack: 89 chips. Pot is 252 chips. Amount to call: 36. I have 89 total, and I've already invested some. Let me calculate: I started with 89, but I've already called preflop raise, flop bet, turn bet. Actually let me trace: preflop I raised to 20, then opponent raised to 32, I called 12 more. So preflop I put in 20 total? Actually my raise was to 20, then opponent raised to 32, I called 12 more, so total preflop investment: 32? Wait: I raised to 20, opponent raised to 32 (additional 12 from my 20? Actually opponent's raise to 32 means total pot. I had already put 20, need to add 12 to match 32, so I called 12. So preflop I put in 32 total.\n\nFlop: opponent bet 36, I called 36. Turn: opponent bet 36, I called 36. So total invested: 32 + 36 + 36 = 104? That's more than my stack of 89. Something off. Let me recalc: My stack is 89 chips at start of hand. Preflop: I raised to 20 (so 20 chips). Then opponent raised to 32, I called 12 more, so total preflop: 32 chips. That leaves 57 chips. Flop: opponent bet 36, I called 36, leaving 21 chips. Turn: opponent bet 36, but I only have 21 left? Actually I have 21 after flop call, but opponent bet 36, I can only call 21 (all-in). But description says \"turn: Seat 3 call 36\". That suggests I had 36 to call. Possibly my stack was larger at start of hand? Let me check: \"Your Stack: 89 chips (11.1 BB)\" at river stage. But maybe I had more earlier? The hand history might show cumulative. Let me think: At river, I have 89 chips. Pot is 252. Opponent bet 36. So I have 89 chips behind. That means I haven't put all my chips in yet. So my earlier calculation is wrong.\n\nLet me reconstruct: Starting stack 89. Preflop: I raise to 20 (put 20 in). Opponent raises to 32 (I need to add 12 to match). So I call 12 more, total invested 32. Stack now 57. Flop: opponent bets 36, I call 36. Stack now 21. Turn: opponent bets 36, but I only have 21, so I call 21 all-in? But description says \"turn: Seat 3 call 36\". That might be a mistake, or maybe I had more chips. Actually maybe my stack at start of hand was larger than 89? The 89 is current stack at river. That means I've already put in chips, but still have 89 left. So starting stack must have been larger. Let's calculate backwards: At river I have 89. I need to call 36. If I call, I'll have 53 left. So I've already put in (starting stack - 89). But we don't know starting stack. However, the pot is 252 chips. That includes all bets so far. Let's calculate total pot: Preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, I raised to 20, opponent raised to 32, I called 12. So preflop pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + my 20 + opponent's 32? Actually opponent's raise to 32 includes his SB of 4? Let's not get bogged down.\n\nBetter to focus on decision: I have top pair with ace kicker, board paired fives. Opponent has been betting all streets: preflop 3-bet, flop bet, turn bet, river bet. This looks like a strong hand. Could"

          "content": "I need to analyze this river decision. I have Ac Jc, board: 5c 9d 2c 5s Ah. I have top pair with ace and jack kicker. The board paired fives, so there's a possible full house if opponent has a five. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has been betting consistently: preflop 3-bet, flop bet, turn bet, river bet. This line is strong.\n\nFrom opponent history: I see they've shown down various hands: Ad 5d (pair of fives with ace kicker), Js Qc (jack high), 3h 4h (straight draw), Kd 6s (pair of sixes), Td 7d (ten high). They've raised preflop multiple times. They tend to check rivers rather than bet. In 7 river actions, all were check or fold, no bets. This is their first river bet observed. That suggests this river bet is strong.\n\nPot is 252 chips, I need to call 36. That's pot odds of 252:36 or 7:1. I need about 12.5% equity to call. I have top pair with jack kicker. What can they have? They 3-bet preflop, so range includes: strong aces (AK, AQ, maybe AJ, AT), pairs (TT+, maybe 99, 88), suited connectors maybe. They bet flop on 5c 9d 2c board. That's a dry board except for flush draw. They bet turn when 5s pairs the board. Now river brings Ah, giving me top pair. But this ace might improve their hand if they have AX. They could have AK, AQ, maybe AT. They could have a five (A5, 55, maybe suited connectors with five). 55 is unlikely as only one combo left (since two fives on board). A5 suited possible. They could have an overpair like TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA. AA unlikely as I have an ace. KK possible.\n\nMy hand: Aces with jack kicker. If they have AK or AQ, I'm beat. If they have AT, I win. If they have a five, I'm beat. If they have an overpair like KK, QQ, JJ, I'm beat (JJ ties). If they have a bluff with missed flush draw or straight draw, I win.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to check rivers, this bet looks value-heavy. They're likely betting for value with a hand that beats top pair. They might have AK, AQ, or a five. They could also have a slow-played set of nines or deuces, but those would likely check river after pairing board? Actually set of nines would be full house now (9s full of fives). That's possible.\n\nMy stack is 89 chips (11.1 BB). Tournament considerations: I'm short-stacked. Folding leaves me with 89 chips (11.1 BB). Calling and losing leaves me with 53 chips (6.6 BB). Calling and winning gives me 89 + 252 = 341 chips? Actually if I call 36 and win, I get the pot of 252 + opponent's river bet 36 + my call 36 = 324 total pot? Wait, pot is 252 before river bet. Opponent bet 36, making pot 288. I call 36, making pot 324. I'd have 89 - 36 = 53 left, plus win 324, total 377 chips. That's a big boost.\n\nBut if I'm likely beat, I should fold. Let's think about my hand strength: I called flop and turn with ace-high flush draw. Flop was 5c 9d 2c - I had ace-high flush draw with two overcards (ace and jack). Good call. Turn was 5s, pairing board, I called with flush draw and maybe pair if I hit ace. River brought Ah, giving me top pair. So my hand improved.\n\nOpponent's line: 3-bet preflop, bet flop, bet turn, bet river. That's consistent with strong hand: overpair, maybe top pair good kicker, maybe set. The river ace might have improved them if they have AX. But they might also be betting for value with worse aces like AT, A9, maybe A2. But would they 3-bet those preflop? Possibly A9s, A2s. But A9s would have two pair now (aces and nines). A2s would have two pair (aces and deuces). Both beat my AJ.\n\nGiven the pot odds (7:1), I only need 12.5% equity. Even if I'm behind, I might"

Preflop: I raised to 20 (so 20 chips). Then opponent raised to 32, I called 12 more, so total preflop: 32 chips. That leaves 57 chips. Flop: opponent bet 36, I called 36, leaving 21 chips. Turn: opponent bet 36, but I only have 21 left? Actually I have 21 after flop call, but opponent bet 36, I can only call 21 (all-in). But description says \"turn: Seat 3 call 36\". That suggests I had 36 to call. Possibly my stack was larger at start of hand? Let me check: \"Your Stack: 89 chips (11.1 BB)\" at river stage. But maybe I had more earlier? The hand history might show cumulative. Let me think: At river, I have 89 chips. Pot is 252. Opponent bet 36. So I have 89 chips behind. That means I haven't put all my chips in yet. So my earlier calculation is wrong.\n\nLet me reconstruct: Starting stack 89. Preflop: I raise to 20 (put 20 in). Opponent raises to 32 (I need to add 12 to match). So I call 12 more, total invested 32. Stack now 57. Flop: opponent bets 36, I call 36. Stack now 21. Turn: opponent bets 36, but I only have 21, so I call 21 all-in? But description says \"turn: Seat 3 call 36\". That might be a mistake, or maybe I had more chips. Actually maybe my stack at start of hand was larger than 89? The 89 is current stack at river. That means I've already put in chips, but still have 89 left. So starting stack must have been larger. Let's calculate backwards: At river I have 89. I need to call 36. If I call, I'll have 53 left. So I've already put in (starting stack - 89). But we don't know starting stack. However, the pot is 252 chips. That includes all bets so far. Let's calculate total pot: Preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, I raised to 20, opponent raised to 32, I called 12. So preflop pot: SB 4 + BB 8 + my 20 + opponent's 32? Actually opponent's raise to 32 includes his SB of 4? Let's not get bogged down.\n\nBetter to focus on decision: I have top pair with ace kicker, board paired fives. Opponent has been betting all streets: preflop 3-bet, flop bet, turn bet, river bet. This looks like a strong hand. Could",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this river decision. I have Ac Jc, board: 5c 9d 2c 5s Ah. I have top pair with ace and jack kicker. The board paired fives, so there's a possible full house if opponent has a five. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has been betting consistently: preflop 3-bet, flop bet, turn bet, river bet. This line is strong.\n\nFrom opponent history: I see they've shown down various hands: Ad 5d (pair of fives with ace kicker), Js Qc (jack high), 3h 4h (straight draw), Kd 6s (pair of sixes), Td 7d (ten high). They've raised preflop multiple times. They tend to check rivers rather than bet. In 7 river actions, all were check or fold, no bets. This is their first river bet observed. That suggests this river bet is strong.\n\nPot is 252 chips, I need to call 36. That's pot odds of 252:36 or 7:1. I need about 12.5% equity to call. I have top pair with jack kicker. What can they have? They 3-bet preflop, so range includes: strong aces (AK, AQ, maybe AJ, AT), pairs (TT+, maybe 99, 88), suited connectors maybe. They bet flop on 5c 9d 2c board. That's a dry board except for flush draw. They bet turn when 5s pairs the board. Now river brings Ah, giving me top pair. But this ace might improve their hand if they have AX. They could have AK, AQ, maybe AT. They could have a five (A5, 55, maybe suited connectors with five). 55 is unlikely as only one combo left (since two fives on board). A5 suited possible. They could have an overpair like TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA. AA unlikely as I have an ace. KK possible.\n\nMy hand: Aces with jack kicker. If they have AK or AQ, I'm beat. If they have AT, I win. If they have a five, I'm beat. If they have an overpair like KK, QQ, JJ, I'm beat (JJ ties). If they have a bluff with missed flush draw or straight draw, I win.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to check rivers, this bet looks value-heavy. They're likely betting for value with a hand that beats top pair. They might have AK, AQ, or a five. They could also have a slow-played set of nines or deuces, but those would likely check river after pairing board? Actually set of nines would be full house now (9s full of fives). That's possible.\n\nMy stack is 89 chips (11.1 BB). Tournament considerations: I'm short-stacked. Folding leaves me with 89 chips (11.1 BB). Calling and losing leaves me with 53 chips (6.6 BB). Calling and winning gives me 89 + 252 = 341 chips? Actually if I call 36 and win, I get the pot of 252 + opponent's river bet 36 + my call 36 = 324 total pot? Wait, pot is 252 before river bet. Opponent bet 36, making pot 288. I call 36, making pot 324. I'd have 89 - 36 = 53 left, plus win 324, total 377 chips. That's a big boost.\n\nBut if I'm likely beat, I should fold. Let's think about my hand strength: I called flop and turn with ace-high flush draw. Flop was 5c 9d 2c - I had ace-high flush draw with two overcards (ace and jack). Good call. Turn was 5s, pairing board, I called with flush draw and maybe pair if I hit ace. River brought Ah, giving me top pair. So my hand improved.\n\nOpponent's line: 3-bet preflop, bet flop, bet turn, bet river. That's consistent with strong hand: overpair, maybe top pair good kicker, maybe set. The river ace might have improved them if they have AX. But they might also be betting for value with worse aces like AT, A9, maybe A2. But would they 3-bet those preflop? Possibly A9s, A2s. But A9s would have two pair now (aces and nines). A2s would have two pair (aces and deuces). Both beat my AJ.\n\nGiven the pot odds (7:1), I only need 12.5% equity. Even if I'm behind, I might",

          "reasoning_content": "I see opponent has raised preflop multiple times, including raises of various sizes. They've shown down Ad5d (ace-five suited) which is relevant because that hand would have two pair on this board (aces and fives). They also showed JsQc (jack-queen offsuit), 3h4h (suited connector), Kd6s (king-six off), Td7d (ten-seven suited). So they play a wide range.\n\nIn this hand, they 3-bet preflop (raised after my raise). That's a stronger play. Their river bet is unusual - they've checked all 7 previous rivers. This suggests this river bet is strong, likely value.\n\nMy hand: AJ suited, top pair with jack kicker. Board: 5c 9d 2c 5s Ah. The ace on river gives me top pair, but also could improve their hand if they have AX. They could have AK, AQ, AJ (split), AT, A9, A5, A2. A5 and A2 would be two pair. A9 would be two pair (aces and nines). AT would be worse ace. They could also have an overpair like KK, QQ, JJ (JJ splits), TT. They could have a five (like 55 for quads, but unlikely). They could have a set of nines or deuces that turned into full house.\n\nGiven their shown Ad5d previously, they might play A5 suited again. That would be two pair (aces and fives) which beats my AJ.\n\nPot odds: 252 pot, need to call 36. That's 7:1 odds, needing only ~12.5% equity. Even if I'm behind, I might have some outs if they're bluffing or have worse ace. But what worse ace would they have? AT, A8, A7, etc. Would they 3-bet those preflop? Possibly AT suited. But they might also have missed flush draw (clubs) and be bluffing. I have Ac, so they can't have nut flush draw with Ac. They could have KcQc, KcTc, QcJc, etc. But those missed. Would they triple barrel bluff? Possible but less likely given their river checking tendency.\n\nMy stack is short (11.1 BB). If I fold, I have 11.1 BB left, still playable. If I call and lose, I have 6.6 BB, very short. If I call and win, I have ~47 BB (377 chips / 8 = 47 BB). That's a huge boost.\n\nI need to estimate my equity. Let's think about their range: 3-bet preflop from SB vs my BTN raise. Their range could be: strong aces (AK, AQ, AJ, AT suited), pairs (TT+, maybe 99, 88), suited connectors (maybe). They bet flop on 5c9d2c board. That's a c-bet with many hands. They bet turn when board pairs 5s. That's a double barrel. Could be for value or as bluff. River ace comes, they bet. This ace improves many of their value hands (AX). It also improves my hand. If they were bluffing with missed draw, they might give up. But they bet. So likely value.\n\nWhat value hands do they bet that I beat? AT (ace-ten) is possible. A8, A7, etc. Would they 3-bet those? Maybe not. AJ splits. So I only beat AT and worse aces, and bluffs. I lose to AK, AQ, A5, A2, A9, any five, overpairs, sets.\n\nGiven pot odds of 7:1, I need 12.5% equity. I think I have more than that. There's chance they have AT or worse ace, or bluff. Also they might have KK/QQ and think they're value betting, but actually I have ace so they're beat. But would they bet KK on this river after ace comes? Possibly not. They might check. But they bet, so they likely have an ace or better.\n\nI'll call. The pot odds justify it. Even if I'm behind, I have some chance. And tournament life: if I fold, I'm very short anyway. If I win, I'm in great shape.\n\nAction: call. No raise because I'm short and raising would be all-in, but no reason to raise with marginal hand.\n\nLet me output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I see opponent's river actions: all checks or folds, no bets. This is their first river bet. That suggests strength. Their showdown hands include Ad5d (pair of fives with ace kicker), JsQc (jack high), 3h4h (straight draw), Kd6s (pair of sixes), Td7d (ten high). They've shown some speculative hands.\n\nI need to decide. My hand: AcJc, top pair with jack kicker. Board: 5c 9d 2c 5s Ah. I have aces with jack kicker. Opponent's range: They 3-bet preflop. From their shown hands, they 3-bet with Ad5d (suited ace with five). So they might 3-bet with A5s. They also showed JsQc (off-suit broadway) which they might not have 3-bet. They showed 3h4h (suited connectors) which they might not have 3-bet. So their 3-betting range includes strong aces, pairs, maybe suited aces with low kicker.\n\nGiven the board, what hands make sense? They bet flop on 5c9d2c. That's a c-bet on a dry board. They bet turn when board pairs fives (5s). That could be continued betting with overpair, set, or maybe ace-high with flush draw. River brings Ah. This improves my hand to top pair, but also improves any ace in their hand. If they have AK, AQ, they now have top pair better kicker. If they have A5, they now have a full house (aces full of fives). If they have 55, they have quads. If they have 99 or 22, they have full house. If they have an overpair like KK, QQ, JJ, they're still ahead.\n\nThey're betting river after I called flop and turn. I called flop with flush draw, called turn with flush draw or maybe pair. My line looks like a flush draw that missed. They might be value betting with a hand that beats ace-high, thinking I have a missed flush draw. They could be bluffing with a missed draw themselves, but given their river history of checking, this bet seems like value.\n\nPot odds: pot is 252, need to call 36. That's 7:1 odds, requiring ~12.5% equity. Even if I'm behind, I might have some outs if they're bluffing. But what bluffs do they have? Missed flush draws? Board has two clubs, but I have AcJc, so they can't have nut flush draw. They could have KcQc, KcTc, QcTc, etc. But would they 3-bet those preflop? Possibly. Would they bet river as bluff? Maybe, but their river betting tendency suggests they don't bluff rivers often.\n\nMy stack is 89 chips (11.1 BB). If I fold, I have 89 chips, still playable but short. If I call and lose, I have 53 chips (6.6 BB), very short but not dead. If I call and win, I have ~377 chips, a huge boost.\n\nGiven the pot odds, I should call with any reasonable chance. Even if I'm behind 85% of the time, I still have pot odds. Let's estimate my equity against their range. Their value range: AK, AQ, A5s, 99, 22, 55, KK, QQ, JJ, maybe ATs. My hand beats AT, A9, A2, bluffs. They might also value bet worse aces like A9s (two pair), A2s (two pair), which beat me. So I'm only beating AT and bluffs. That's a narrow range.\n\nBut they might also have missed draws like KcQc, QcJc, JcTc, etc. Those are possible. Would they bet those on river? Possibly as bluff.\n\nI think with 7:1 odds, I should call. Even if I'm only ahead 20% of the time, it's profitable. Let's call.\n\nI cannot raise because minimum raise to 72, but I only have 89 total, so I could raise all-in to 89. But raising seems bad because if they have a strong hand, they'll call, and if they're bluffing, they'll fold. Better to just call.\n\nDecision: call.",

However, being out of position reduces my effective equity.\n\nTournament considerations: With 10.1 BB, I'm in push-or-fold territory. I could consider a shove here, but that would be 81 total (raising to 81 from current 8 invested). The opponent would need to call 65 more into a pot of 105 (24 + 81), giving them ~1.6:1 odds, needing ~38% equity. They might fold a lot of their raising range.\n\nBut looking at opponent tendencies: they've shown willingness to raise with marginal hands and have folded to aggression recently. They have a big stack (344 chips vs my 81).\n\nLet me check if they've faced shoves before."

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with 8h7h, a suited connector but not a great hand. My stack is 81 chips (10.1 BB). The opponent in seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 16 total (a min-raise from SB). The pot is 24 chips (4 SB + 8 BB + 12 raise). I need to call 8 more chips to continue.\n\nFrom the opponent data, I see:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised preflop frequently (9 times in the data shown)\n- Their raises vary in size: 6, 8, 12, 8, 12, 40, 8, 12, 16 chips\n- They've shown down hands like 9d8d, 9s8c, 9s8s, Kc9c - mostly marginal hands\n- They've folded preflop several times recently (hands 42, 43, 47, 48, 49)\n\nMy own stack is short (10.1 BB). 8h7s is a suited connector that plays well postflop, but I'm out of position. The pot odds: I need to call 8 to win 32 (24 current pot + 8 my call), so I need ~25% equity.\n\nAgainst a reasonable raising range from SB (maybe 30-40% of hands), 8h7h has about 35-40% equity heads-up. However, being out of position reduces my effective equity.\n\nTournament considerations: With 10.1 BB, I'm in push-or-fold territory. I could consider a shove here, but that would be 81 total (raising to 81 from current 8 invested). The opponent would need to call 65 more into a pot of 105 (24 + 81), giving them ~1.6:1 odds, needing ~38% equity. They might fold a lot of their raising range.\n\nBut looking at opponent tendencies: they've shown willingness to raise with marginal hands and have folded to aggression recently. They have a big stack (344 chips vs my 81).\n\nLet me check if they've faced shoves before.",

Shove applies pressure with fold equity; if called, suited connector has reasonable 35-40% equity against many hands. Better to take initiative than call out of position.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with JSON format. Let me think about this decision:\n\n- Hand: 8h7h (suited connector)\n- Stack: 81 chips (10.1 BB)\n- Position: BB (out of position vs SB raiser)\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 Thinking raised to 16 (min-raise from SB)\n- Pot odds: Need to call 8 to win 32, need 25% equity\n- Tournament: Short stack, push-or-fold territory\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: Conservative, preserve stack for better spot\n2. Call: See flop cheaply with suited connector, but out of position\n3. Raise/shove: Apply pressure, opponent might fold many hands\n\nWith 10.1 BB, standard play is push-or-fold. 8h7s has decent equity against a wide SB raising range. If I shove to 81, opponent needs to call 65 into 105, getting 1.6:1 odds. They might fold many hands in their raising range.\n\nLooking at opponent's recent history: they've folded preflop several times recently (hands 42, 43, 47, 48, 49). This suggests they might be tightening up or cautious. They might fold to a shove.\n\nHowever, 8h7s is not a premium shoving hand from BB vs SB. Typically with 10 BB, I'd shove wider from SB vs BB, but from BB vs SB, I need a stronger hand. But given opponent's recent folding tendencies and my stack size, a shove might be profitable.\n\nLet me consider pot odds: If I call 8 (10% of my stack) to see flop, I'd have 73 left (9.1 BB). That's still playable. But out of position with 8h7h, I'll often miss flop or have marginal hands.\n\nBetter to shove or fold. With suited connector and fold equity, shove seems reasonable. But if called, I'm likely behind but have decent equity against many hands.\n\nI'll go for a shove.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My position: SB (small blind)\n- My cards: 9\u2666 Q\u2665 (off-suit, mediocre hand)\n- My stack: 101 chips (12.6 BB)\n- Pot: 36 chips\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 Thinking in Seat 1 (UTG) raised to 24 (3x BB)\n- Amount to call: 20 chips\n- Minimum raise to: 40 chips\n\n**Stack Analysis:**\n- I have 101 chips total\n- I've already put 4 chips as SB\n- Calling 20 would put 24 total in the pot, leaving me with 77 chips (9.6 BB)\n- If I raise to 40 total (36 more), I'd have 61 chips left (7.6 BB)\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- Q9o is a weak hand, especially from SB position\n- Against a UTG raise, this hand is typically a fold\n- Q9o doesn't play well postflop, especially with a short stack\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall, Kimi-K2 Thinking has:\n- Folded preflop 4 times (hands 47-50)\n- Called once preflop (hand 45)\n- Raised once preflop (hand 50, raised to 16 from UTG)\n- Bet once on river (hand 44)\n\nIn hand 50 (just last hand), they raised to 16 from UTG and then folded. So they're showing some aggression but also folding to resistance.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 36 chips\n- To call: 20 chips\n- Pot odds: 20/(36+20) = 20/56 = 35.7%\n- Need ~36% equity to call\n\n**Equity Considerations:**\n- Q9o vs UTG raising range (likely top 20-25% of hands) has ~30-35% equity\n- With implied odds, but I'm short-stacked\n- Position is bad (SB, will act first postflop)\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 12.6 BB, which is getting short but not desperate\n- Folding leaves me with 97 chips (12.1 BB) - still playable\n- Calling commits 20% of my stack with a weak hand\n- Raising would be committing 36% of my stack\n\n**Better Options:**\n1. Fold - Preserve stack for better spots\n2. Call - Questionable with weak hand and bad position  \n3. Raise - Too aggressive with Q9o, would be a bluff\n\nGiven my stack size, position, and hand strength, folding is the correct play. I should wait for a better spot, especially since I'm not in immediate danger with 12 BB. The pot odds are close but not favorable enough given the positional disadvantage and hand weakness.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q9o is too weak against UTG raise from SB position. With 12.6 BB stack, better to preserve chips for stronger spots. Pot odds (35.7%) borderline but position disadvantage and hand weakness make fold correct.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with Qh Ah (AQ suited). My stack is 101 chips (12.6 BB). Blinds are 4/8. The small blind (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) posted 4, and the big blind (Seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted 8. I need to call 8 to see the flop. Minimum raise is to 16 total.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB): Has been raising preflop recently - raised to 16 in hand 50 and 24 in hand 51. Seems active.\n2. MiniMax-M2 (SB): Raised to 32 preflop in hand 49, called 16 preflop in hand 51. Also active.\n\nMy hand AQ suited is strong, especially from the button. With 12.6 BB stack, I'm getting short. This is a good spot to accumulate chips or go all-in.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 8 into pot of 12 (4 SB + 8 BB). That's 8 to win 12, or 1:1.5 odds. With AQ suited, I have good equity.\n\nGiven my short stack and strong hand, I should consider raising or even going all-in. If I raise to 16 (minimum), that's only 8 more than calling. But with my stack size, I might want to go all-in to maximize fold equity and avoid playing postflop with a short stack.\n\nLet me check: If I go all-in for 101, that's a big raise. The pot would be 12 + 101 = 113 if called by both. If only one calls, pot would be around 109.\n\nActually, thinking about tournament considerations: I have 12.6 BB, which is getting into push/fold territory. AQ suited is definitely a hand worth shoving from the button. The blinds are 4/8, so my 101 chips is significant.\n\nIf I just call 8, I'll have 93 left going to flop with pot of 20. That's awkward stack-to-pot ratio.\n\nBetter to raise. Question is how much. Minimum raise to 16 leaves me with 85 behind in pot of 28. Still awkward.\n\nAll-in seems best with AQ suited given stack size. Let me check if there are any other factors.\n\nWait, I should consider that the SB (MiniMax-M2) might call or raise. They have 417 chips. BB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 392 chips. Both have me covered.\n\nFrom my hand history, I've been playing aggressively when short-stacked (hand 50 I raised to 81 with 87 suited from BB and won).\n\nGiven everything, I think all-in is the best play. AQ suited is too strong to fold, and with my stack size, I want to maximize fold equity and avoid tricky postflop play.\n\nLet me structure the response.",

Both opponents (Kimi-K2 Thinking in BB with 392 chips and MiniMax-M2 in SB with 417 chips) have folded many hands preflop based on my search. \n\nLooking at my recent hands: I won hand #50 with 87 suited by raising to 81 chips from BB, which was an all-in. I have a win rate of 17.6% over 51 hands.\n\nWith AQs on the button and only 12.6 BB, this is a clear push-or-fold situation. AQs is a premium hand, especially in late position. Given my short stack and the fact that both opponents have been folding frequently preflop, going all-in here makes sense. The pot already has 12 chips (blinds), and if I can take it down uncontested, that's a 12% increase to my stack.\n\nIf I get called, AQs has good equity against most calling ranges. The BB has a big stack and might call wider, but my hand is strong enough to take the risk. Folding would be too tight given my stack size.\n\nI should go all-in to 101 chips.

The opponent in seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 16 total from the SB. The pot is 24 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 12 more). I need to call 8 more chips to continue.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: From the recall data, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising preflop quite frequently with various bet sizes (8, 12, 16, 24, 40). This suggests a wide raising range from the SB, likely trying to steal the blinds. In hand #44, they raised to 16 from SB and then checked through flop and turn before betting river. In hand #50, they raised to 16 from SB and folded to a 3-bet. In hand #51, they raised to 24 from SB and then bet flop and turn aggressively.\n\nMy hand: 9d8d is a suited connector that plays well multi-way but heads-up against a SB raise. As BB vs SB raise, I'm getting good pot odds: need to call 8 to win 24, so 1:3 pot odds (25% equity needed). 9d8d has ~40% equity against a typical SB stealing range.\n\nStack considerations: I have 105 chips (13.1 BB). Calling 8 chips leaves me with 97 chips (12.1 BB). This is still playable but getting short. Folding leaves me with 105 chips. Raising could be an option but with my stack size, a raise would be committing.\n\nTournament situation: I need to accumulate chips but also preserve my stack. The opponent has 376 chips (47 BB), so they have me covered.\n\nGiven the pot odds (25% equity needed) and my hand's equity against a likely wide SB stealing range (~40%), calling seems mathematically correct. However, position is bad - I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nAlternative: 3-bet shoving could be considered as a bluff since opponent might fold a wide range, but with only 13 BB effective, a shove would be ~12 BB over a 2 BB raise. That's quite large and might only get called by stronger hands.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: In hand #50 (just 3 hands ago), I had 8h7h in BB vs SB raise and I 3-bet shoved for 81 chips (10 BB) and won without showdown. So opponent has seen me 3-bet shove from BB recently.\n\nDecision: I think calling is best. Good pot odds, decent hand that can make strong draws or two pair. If I hit a good flop, I can continue. If not, I can fold. The implied odds are decent if I hit a strong hand.\n\nLet me call."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with 9d8d (suited connector, decent speculative hand). My stack is 105 chips (13.1 BB). The opponent in seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 16 total from the SB. The pot is 24 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 12 more). I need to call 8 more chips to continue.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: From the recall data, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising preflop quite frequently with various bet sizes (8, 12, 16, 24, 40). This suggests a wide raising range from the SB, likely trying to steal the blinds. In hand #44, they raised to 16 from SB and then checked through flop and turn before betting river. In hand #50, they raised to 16 from SB and folded to a 3-bet. In hand #51, they raised to 24 from SB and then bet flop and turn aggressively.\n\nMy hand: 9d8d is a suited connector that plays well multi-way but heads-up against a SB raise. As BB vs SB raise, I'm getting good pot odds: need to call 8 to win 24, so 1:3 pot odds (25% equity needed). 9d8d has ~40% equity against a typical SB stealing range.\n\nStack considerations: I have 105 chips (13.1 BB). Calling 8 chips leaves me with 97 chips (12.1 BB). This is still playable but getting short. Folding leaves me with 105 chips. Raising could be an option but with my stack size, a raise would be committing.\n\nTournament situation: I need to accumulate chips but also preserve my stack. The opponent has 376 chips (47 BB), so they have me covered.\n\nGiven the pot odds (25% equity needed) and my hand's equity against a likely wide SB stealing range (~40%), calling seems mathematically correct. However, position is bad - I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nAlternative: 3-bet shoving could be considered as a bluff since opponent might fold a wide range, but with only 13 BB effective, a shove would be ~12 BB over a 2 BB raise. That's quite large and might only get called by stronger hands.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: In hand #50 (just 3 hands ago), I had 8h7h in BB vs SB raise and I 3-bet shoved for 81 chips (10 BB) and won without showdown. So opponent has seen me 3-bet shove from BB recently.\n\nDecision: I think calling is best. Good pot odds, decent hand that can make strong draws or two pair. If I hit a good flop, I can continue. If not, I can fold. The implied odds are decent if I hit a strong hand.\n\nLet me call.",

Opponent raised to 16 from SB (2 BB raise). I need to call 8 more chips. Pot is 24 chips. Pot odds: 8 to win 24 = 1:3 = 25% equity needed.\n\n9d8s suited has decent equity against a SB stealing range. Against a typical SB opening range (say 40% of hands), 9d8d has about 41% equity. So calling is +EV.\n\nPosition: I'll be out of position, which is a disadvantage, but with my stack size, I'll be playing fit-or-fold postflop.\n\nStack preservation: I have 105 chips, calling leaves 97 (12.1 BB). Still playable.\n\nAlternative: Raise. Minimum raise to 24 total (8 more than current bet of 16). But raising commits more chips and I'd be out of position. Or I could shove for 105 total, but that's a huge overbet (12 BB over a 2 BB raise). Might get folds from weak parts of opponent's range, but might only get called by better hands.\n\nGiven opponent's tendencies: They raise frequently from SB, but also fold to 3-bets sometimes (hand #50). However, my recent 3-bet shove from BB might make them more likely to call with a wider range now.\n\nI think calling is the most balanced approach. Good pot odds, decent hand, preserve some chips.\n\nSo action: call. No raise_to needed.\n\nResponse format: JSON with action, raise_to (null), reasoning.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 9d 8d - suited connectors, but not hitting this flop (4d Jc Kc). I have a backdoor flush draw with diamonds, but the board has two clubs which could be scary. I have no pair, no straight draw yet (need 6-7 or T-Q for straight).\n\n2. **Board**: 4d Jc Kc - This is a very dry flop that likely hits the preflop raiser's range (Kx, JJ, maybe 44, AK, KQ, KJ, etc.)\n\n3. **Opponent action**: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised preflop to 16, then bet 48 on the flop into a pot of 80. That's a 60% pot bet, which is strong. Looking at the opponent history, they raised preflop in hand 50 and 51, then bet flop in hand 51. They seem to be aggressive.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 97 chips total (12.1 BB). I already have 8 in from BB, plus 8 call preflop = 16 invested. To call 48 more, I'd be putting in half my stack (49 total invested). The pot would be 128 after my call.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 48 to win 128 (80 current pot + 48 opponent bet). That's 48/176 = 27% pot odds. I need about 27% equity to call.\n\n6. **Equity analysis**: With 9d8d on 4dJcKc, I have:\n   - No pair\n   - Backdoor flush draw (runner-runner diamonds) ~4%\n   - Backdoor straight draw (need 6-7 or T-Q) ~4%\n   - Total equity against a strong range (top pair, overpair, sets) is probably around 15-20%\n\n7. **Tournament situation**: I'm very short stacked (12.1 BB). If I fold, I have 97 chips left. If I call and lose, I'm down to 49 chips (6 BB). That's critically short.\n\n8. **Implied odds**: Even if I hit a miracle turn, I don't have much stack left to extract value. And the board has two clubs, so flush draws are possible.\n\nGiven my equity is below the required pot odds, my short stack situation, and the fact that I'm likely behind to a strong range from the preflop raiser, folding is the correct play. I should wait for a better spot with my short stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9d8d missed flop (4dJcKc) with only backdoor draws.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 8h Th, with 93 chips (11.6 BB). I posted the small blind of 4 chips, and it's folded to me. The big blind is MiniMax-M2 with 409 chips. I need to call 4 more chips to complete the blind, or I can raise, or fold.\n\nMy hand: 8h Th is a marginal hand. It's suited, which gives it some potential for flushes, but it's low connected. I have position (button) which is good.\n\nMy stack: 93 chips (11.6 BB) is short-stacked. In tournament poker with short stacks, we often need to be aggressive and look for spots to accumulate chips or go all-in preflop.\n\nThe opponent: MiniMax-M2 has folded the last 3 hands preflop (hands 51, 52, 53). Looking at the opponent actions: they folded hand 50 preflop, called a raise in hand 51, then folded on turn, then folded hands 52 and 53 preflop. They seem somewhat tight recently.\n\nPot odds: The pot is 12 chips (4 SB + 8 BB). I need to call 4 chips to win 12, so I'm getting 3:1 pot odds. That's excellent odds.\n\nWith my short stack and good pot odds, folding seems too tight. Calling is an option, but raising might be better to take initiative.\n\nIf I raise, minimum raise is to 16 total (I already have 4 in, so need to add 12 more). My stack is 93, so I could raise to various amounts. Given my stack size, a standard raise would be 2.5-3x BB = 20-24 total. Or I could go all-in for 93.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy with short stack: When under 15 BB, we often want to shove or fold from late positions. With 11.6 BB on the button against one opponent (BB), this is a prime shove spot with many hands.\n\nMy hand 8h Th is not premium, but it's decent for a short-stack shove from the button. The BB has been folding recently, so they might fold to aggression. Even if they call, my hand has decent equity against a random calling range.\n\nLet me think about ranges: If I shove 93 chips (11.6 BB), the BB needs to call 85 more chips (93 total - 8 already in) to win 106 pot (93 + 12 + 1?). Actually: pot would be 12 (current) + 89 (my additional) = 101 total. BB needs to call 85 to win 101, getting about 1.2:1 odds, needing ~45% equity.\n\nThe BB's calling range against an 11.6 BB shove from button might be around top 20-30% of hands. Against that range, 8h Th has about 35-40% equity. Not great, but with fold equity, it could be profitable.\n\nAlternative: I could min-raise to 16, but then I'm committing 16/93 = 17% of my stack, and likely facing a shove from BB if they want to play. That puts me in a tough spot.\n\nBetter to either fold or shove. With 3:1 pot odds to call, folding seems too weak. Shoving has fold equity.\n\nLet me check my recent hands: I've been fairly aggressive recently, winning hands 47, 50, 52 with raises. My image might be aggressive.\n\nGiven all factors: short stack, button position, good pot odds, opponent showing recent folds, and need to accumulate chips, I think shoving is the best play.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 93,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Short stack (11.6 BB) on button with suited connector. Shoving maximizes fold equity against BB who has folded last 3 hands preflop. With 3:1 pot odds to call, folding is too tight.

The flop came 6s 3s Jd. My hand is 8-high with no draws (no flush draw, no straight draw). I have backdoor straight possibilities if turn and river are 9 and Q, but that's very unlikely.\n\nGiven that I'm already all-in, I can't make any more decisions. The hand will continue to showdown automatically since I have no more chips to bet. I should just check (since amount to call is 0).\n\nActually wait, I need to think: Since I'm all-in with only 4 chips, and the pot is 186, I have no further action. The flop betting will continue between the other players if there were any, but Seat 4 already called preflop and now we're on the flop. Since I'm all-in, I can only check/fold, but checking is the only logical option since folding would forfeit my chance to win the pot.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: The pot is 186 chips. I contributed 4 chips. Seat 4 contributed the rest (182 chips). Since I'm all-in, the main pot is 8 chips (my 4 + opponent's 4) and there might be a side pot if Seat 4 bets more, but I can't win the side pot anyway.\n\nI should check and see what happens. This is a tournament situation and I'm essentially on life support with 0.5 BB. I need to hope my 8h Th can improve.\n\nLet me check: 8h Th on 6s 3s Jd gives me:\n- No pair\n- No flush draw (hearts vs spades board)\n- Backdoor straight: need 9 and Q (8-9-T-J-Q)\n- Very weak hand\n\nBut since I'm all-in, I have no choice but to check and hope for the best.",

Wait, that seems impossible with only 4 chips total. Let me check the actions again:\n\n- Preflop: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 4\n- Preflop: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) post_bb 8  \n- Preflop: Seat 1 fold\n- Preflop: Seat 3 raise 93\n- Preflop: Seat 4 call 85\n\nThis doesn't make sense mathematically. I had 4 chips total. After posting SB 4, I have 0 chips left. How can I raise to 93? This must be an error or some tournament situation where I have more chips than shown.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes: I have 4 chips, but the pot is 271 chips. That's huge. And I need to call 85 chips with only 4 chips. This is impossible unless there's something wrong with the chip counts.\n\nWait, maybe the \"Your Stack: 4 chips (0.5 BB)\" is a mistake? Or maybe this is a tournament where I have chips in play that aren't reflected in the stack display?\n\nLet me think: If I have only 4 chips, I couldn't have raised to 93 preflop. But the action shows I did. So either:\n1. The stack display is wrong\n2. There's some tournament mechanic I don't understand\n3. This is a bug\n\nGiven that I need to make a decision now: I have 8h Th on a 6s 3s Jd board. The pot is 271 chips. Seat 4 bet 85, and I need to call 85. But I only have 4 chips according to the display.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions: \"fold, call\" - I can call. But if I only have 4 chips, calling 85 is impossible. Unless I'm already all-in with my 4 chips?\n\nWait, I think I understand: I have 4 chips LEFT after posting SB. But I already committed those 4 chips as SB. So I have 0 chips. But then how did I raise to 93? \n\nActually, re-reading: \"preflop: Seat 3 raise 93\" - maybe this means I raised BY 93, not TO 93? But that would be even more impossible with 4 chips.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me check the pot size: 271 chips. That's consistent with: SB 4 + BB 8 + my raise 93 + opponent's call 85 = 190 chips preflop, plus flop bet 85 = 275 chips. Close enough.\n\nGiven the mathematical impossibility, I think the \"Your Stack: 4 chips\" display must be wrong. I must have more chips than that.\n\nLet me analyze the hand based on the actual situation: I have 8h Th, board is 6s 3s Jd. I raised preflop, opponent called. I checked flop, opponent bet 85 into 190 pot (about 45% pot).\n\nMy hand: 8h Th. I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 9 for 7-8-9-T-J straight). Also backdoor flush potential (hearts). Very weak hand.\n\nOpponent: MiniMax-M2 has 239 chips. From history, they seem reasonably tight - folded to my raises in hands 50, 52, 53. Called once in hand 51 with position.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 85 to win 271+85=356. That's about 24% pot odds. My equity: With gutshot (4 outs) + maybe some runner-runner hearts or pairs, maybe 15-20% equity at best. Not getting good direct odds.\n\nBut I raised preflop, so I have some fold equity if I shove? Actually, I can't raise - only legal actions are fold or call.\n\nGiven I have a very weak hand, poor pot odds, and opponent likely has at least a piece of this board (J or better), I should fold.\n\nBut wait - if I'm actually short-stacked (maybe I have less than 85 chips?), then calling might be a tournament desperation move. But the math still doesn't work.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll go with the logical poker decision: fold this weak hand on this flop.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Hand 8h Th on 6s 3s Jd flop has very little equity (gutshot draw only).

Wait, that seems impossible with only 4 chips total. Let me check the actions again:\n\n- Preflop: Seat 3 (me) post_sb 4\n- Preflop: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) post_bb 8  \n- Preflop: Seat 1 fold\n- Preflop: Seat 3 raise 93\n- Preflop: Seat 4 call 85\n\nThis doesn't make sense mathematically. I had 4 chips total. After posting SB 4, I have 0 chips left. How can I raise to 93? This must be an error or some tournament situation where I have more chips than shown.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes: I have 4 chips, but the pot is 271 chips. That's huge. And I need to call 85 chips with only 4 chips. This is impossible unless there's something wrong with the chip counts.\n\nWait, maybe the \"Your Stack: 4 chips (0.5 BB)\" is a mistake? Or maybe this is a tournament where I have chips in play that aren't reflected in the stack display?\n\nLet me think: If I have only 4 chips, I couldn't have raised to 93 preflop. But the action shows I did. So either:\n1. The stack display is wrong\n2. There's some tournament mechanic I don't understand\n3. This is a bug\n\nGiven that I need to make a decision now: I have 8h Th on a 6s 3s Jd board. The pot is 271 chips. Seat 4 bet 85, and I need to call 85. But I only have 4 chips according to the display.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions: \"fold, call\" - I can call. But if I only have 4 chips, calling 85 is impossible. Unless I'm already all-in with my 4 chips?\n\nWait, I think I understand: I have 4 chips LEFT after posting SB. But I already committed those 4 chips as SB. So I have 0 chips. But then how did I raise to 93? \n\nActually, re-reading: \"preflop: Seat 3 raise 93\" - maybe this means I raised BY 93, not TO 93? But that would be even more impossible with 4 chips.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me check the pot size: 271 chips. That's consistent with: SB 4 + BB 8 + my raise 93 + opponent's call 85 = 190 chips preflop, plus flop bet 85 = 275 chips. Close enough.\n\nGiven the mathematical impossibility, I think the \"Your Stack: 4 chips\" display must be wrong. I must have more chips than that.\n\nLet me analyze the hand based on the actual situation: I have 8h Th, board is 6s 3s Jd. I raised preflop, opponent called. I checked flop, opponent bet 85 into 190 pot (about 45% pot).\n\nMy hand: 8h Th. I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 9 for 7-8-9-T-J straight). Also backdoor flush potential (hearts). Very weak hand.\n\nOpponent: MiniMax-M2 has 239 chips. From history, they seem reasonably tight - folded to my raises in hands 50, 52, 53. Called once in hand 51 with position.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 85 to win 271+85=356. That's about 24% pot odds. My equity: With gutshot (4 outs) + maybe some runner-runner hearts or pairs, maybe 15-20% equity at best. Not getting good direct odds.\n\nBut I raised preflop, so I have some fold equity if I shove? Actually, I can't raise - only legal actions are fold or call.\n\nGiven I have a very weak hand, poor pot odds, and opponent likely has at least a piece of this board (J or better), I should fold.\n\nBut wait - if I'm actually short-stacked (maybe I have less than 85 chips?), then calling might be a tournament desperation move. But the math still doesn't work.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll go with the logical poker decision: fold this weak hand on this flop.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Hand 8h Th on 6s 3s Jd flop has very little equity (gutshot draw only).

I have 8h Th on 6s 3s Jd board. I raised preflop, opponent called. I checked flop, opponent bet 85 into 271 pot.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: MiniMax-M2 has folded to my raises in hands 50, 52, 53. Called once in hand 51. So they're somewhat tight. Their bet on this flop suggests they have something - likely at least a J, maybe a pair+draw, or a strong hand.\n\nMy hand: 8h Th. I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 9) - 4 outs. Also backdoor flush potential with hearts - but board has two spades, not hearts. So really just 4 clean outs to a straight.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 85 to win 271+85=356. That's 85/356 = 23.9% pot odds. My equity with 4 outs is about 8.5% on the turn, 16.5% by river if I see both cards. Not getting direct odds.\n\nBut I raised preflop, representing strength. However, opponent called and then bet into me on the flop, which suggests they're not afraid of my preflop raise.\n\nGiven my weak hand, poor pot odds, and opponent showing strength, folding is correct. Even if I'm short-stacked (the 4 chips display seems wrong), this isn't a good spot to gamble.\n\nWait, but if I'm actually very short-stacked (maybe I have less than 85 chips?), then pot odds might force me to call with any equity. But the math still doesn't add up - if I only have 4 chips, I can't call 85.\n\nActually, looking at the action sequence again: \"preflop: Seat 3 raise 93\" - maybe I raised all-in for my remaining 4 chips? But that would be \"raise 4\", not \"raise 93\". \n\nI think there's a display error.

The blinds are 4/8, so I have just half a big blind left. Seat 4 posted SB 4, Seat 1 posted BB 8. The pot is 12 chips. I need to call 8 chips, but I only have 4 chips total. Wait, looking at the situation: \"Your Stack: 4 chips (0.5 BB)\" and \"Amount to call: 8\". This means I'm effectively all-in if I call - I can only put in my remaining 4 chips.\n\nActually, I should think about this more carefully. The pot already has 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8). If I call, I put in my last 4 chips. Then Seat 4 (SB) would have to call an additional 4 to match? Or maybe they've already put in 4, so they need to put in 4 more to match the BB? Actually, Seat 4 posted SB 4, Seat 1 posted BB 8. The action is on me. I need to call 8, but I only have 4. In poker, when you don't have enough to call, you can go all-in for your remaining stack.\n\nBut wait, let me check the legal actions: only \"fold, call\" are available. No raise option. So I can either fold or call. If I call, I put in my remaining 4 chips (all-in). Then there would be a side pot if others continue.\n\nGiven my stack is only 4 chips (0.5 BB), and I have 8c 4s - one of the worst possible hands - this is a clear fold. Even though it's only 4 chips, it's still 50% of my stack. But actually, I have to consider tournament survival. With only 0.5 BB, I'm essentially dead anyway. I'll be forced all-in next hand from the small blind.\n\nActually, let me think: I'm on the button now. Next hand I'll be in the small blind position. The blinds are 4/8, so I'll have to post SB of 4 chips, which is my entire stack. So I'll be all-in next hand regardless. So I might as well take a chance now with any two cards.\n\nBut wait, I have position advantage here (button). However, my hand is terrible - 8c 4s is trash. But with only 0.5 BB, any two cards might be worth going all-in. The pot already has 12 chips. If I go all-in for 4 chips, I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (12:4). Actually, it's even better: if I call and both opponents fold, I win 12 chips. If they call, I have a chance to triple up.\n\nActually, let me check opponent tendencies. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) seems aggressive - has raised preflop multiple times. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has called some hands. But they might not call with weak hands given the tiny additional amount.\n\nActually, the math: I put in 4 to win 12, so I need only 25% equity to break even. Even 8c 4s has some equity against random hands.\n\nBut there's another consideration: I'm essentially forced all-in next hand anyway. So I should take this opportunity now rather than wait for the next hand where I'll be in worse position (SB).\n\nActually, next hand I'll be SB and have to post 4 chips blind. So I'll be all-in with a random hand from SB. Here I have button position and can see if anyone raises before me. Actually, action is on me now - no one has raised yet.\n\nWait, the action sequence: Seat 4 posted SB, Seat 1 posted BB, action is on me (button). So I act first preflop. If I fold, then action goes to Seat 4 (SB) who can complete or raise, then Seat 1 (BB).\n\nIf I go all-in now for 4 chips, Seat 4 would need to call 4 more (total 8), and Seat 1 would have his 8 already in. They might fold marginal hands.\n\nGiven my desperate situation with 0.5 BB, I should go all-in with any two cards. The hand is terrible, but the situation demands it.\n\nActually, let me check if there's any history of these opponents folding to small all-ins. Let me search."

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 8c 4s, which is an absolutely terrible hand. My stack is only 4 chips (0.5 BB). The blinds are 4/8, so I have just half a big blind left. Seat 4 posted SB 4, Seat 1 posted BB 8. The pot is 12 chips. I need to call 8 chips, but I only have 4 chips total. Wait, looking at the situation: \"Your Stack: 4 chips (0.5 BB)\" and \"Amount to call: 8\". This means I'm effectively all-in if I call - I can only put in my remaining 4 chips.\n\nActually, I should think about this more carefully. The pot already has 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8). If I call, I put in my last 4 chips. Then Seat 4 (SB) would have to call an additional 4 to match? Or maybe they've already put in 4, so they need to put in 4 more to match the BB? Actually, Seat 4 posted SB 4, Seat 1 posted BB 8. The action is on me. I need to call 8, but I only have 4. In poker, when you don't have enough to call, you can go all-in for your remaining stack.\n\nBut wait, let me check the legal actions: only \"fold, call\" are available. No raise option. So I can either fold or call. If I call, I put in my remaining 4 chips (all-in). Then there would be a side pot if others continue.\n\nGiven my stack is only 4 chips (0.5 BB), and I have 8c 4s - one of the worst possible hands - this is a clear fold. Even though it's only 4 chips, it's still 50% of my stack. But actually, I have to consider tournament survival. With only 0.5 BB, I'm essentially dead anyway. I'll be forced all-in next hand from the small blind.\n\nActually, let me think: I'm on the button now. Next hand I'll be in the small blind position. The blinds are 4/8, so I'll have to post SB of 4 chips, which is my entire stack. So I'll be all-in next hand regardless. So I might as well take a chance now with any two cards.\n\nBut wait, I have position advantage here (button). However, my hand is terrible - 8c 4s is trash. But with only 0.5 BB, any two cards might be worth going all-in. The pot already has 12 chips. If I go all-in for 4 chips, I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (12:4). Actually, it's even better: if I call and both opponents fold, I win 12 chips. If they call, I have a chance to triple up.\n\nActually, let me check opponent tendencies. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) seems aggressive - has raised preflop multiple times. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has called some hands. But they might not call with weak hands given the tiny additional amount.\n\nActually, the math: I put in 4 to win 12, so I need only 25% equity to break even. Even 8c 4s has some equity against random hands.\n\nBut there's another consideration: I'm essentially forced all-in next hand anyway. So I should take this opportunity now rather than wait for the next hand where I'll be in worse position (SB).\n\nActually, next hand I'll be SB and have to post 4 chips blind. So I'll be all-in with a random hand from SB. Here I have button position and can see if anyone raises before me. Actually, action is on me now - no one has raised yet.\n\nWait, the action sequence: Seat 4 posted SB, Seat 1 posted BB, action is on me (button). So I act first preflop. If I fold, then action goes to Seat 4 (SB) who can complete or raise, then Seat 1 (BB).\n\nIf I go all-in now for 4 chips, Seat 4 would need to call 4 more (total 8), and Seat 1 would have his 8 already in. They might fold marginal hands.\n\nGiven my desperate situation with 0.5 BB, I should go all-in with any two cards. The hand is terrible, but the situation demands it.\n\nActually, let me check if there's any history of these opponents folding to small all-ins. Let me search.",

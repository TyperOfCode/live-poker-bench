            "reasoning_content": "  The opponent MiniMax-M2 has a pattern:\n- They frequently fold preflop (11 out of 19 actions were folds)\n- When they do enter pots, they tend to be aggressive post-flop (they bet on flop in hands 2, 3, and 6)\n- They raised preflop in hand 6 and then continued betting on flop and turn\n- In hand 11 they raised preflop but we don't have postflop data\n\nIn this current hand, they just called preflop (limp), which is unusual for them. This suggests they might have a medium-strength hand or a speculative hand.\n\nMy hand: Kd 6d\nBoard: Kc Jc 9h\n\nI have top pair with a weak kicker (K6). The board is very coordinated with two clubs and a straight draw possibility (Q-T would make a straight). There are many hands that could beat me or have strong draws:\n- Any K with a better kicker (KJ, K9, KQ, KT, etc.)\n- Sets (JJ, 99)\n- Two pairs (KJ, K9, J9)\n- Flush draws (any two clubs)\n- Straight draws (QT, T8, Q8)\n\nSince MiniMax-M2 limped preflop and I checked, they're now facing a decision. The pot is 5 chips. I have the option to check or bet.\n\nGiven the coordinated board and my weak kicker, I should be cautious. Checking allows me to:\n1. Control the pot size with a marginal hand\n2. See what MiniMax-M2 does - if they bet, I can evaluate based on their sizing\n3. Potentially improve on the turn (though I only have 3 outs to improve my kicker - the remaining 6s)\n\nA bet would be a protection bet, but against this opponent who tends to be aggressive when they enter pots, a check might be better to induce a bluff or keep the pot small.\n\nI think checking is the best play here.",

My kicker is 6d.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They frequently fold preflop (hands 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13)\n- When they do play, they tend to:\n  - Call preflop (hands 2, 3, 6)\n  - Bet on flop/turn (hands 2, 3, 6)\n  - In hand 6, they raised preflop, bet flop 8, bet turn 8, then checked river\n\nSo MiniMax-M2 is somewhat aggressive when they do play, but they fold a lot preflop. The board has a flush draw (3 clubs). I have trips with a weak kicker.\n\nGiven the board texture:\n- There are 3 Kings on board, so I have trips\n- Possible straight draws (Q-T would make a straight)\n- Possible flush draw (3 clubs)\n- My kicker is weak (6d)\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2 bet 2 on the flop and I called. The turn is Kh which gives me trips. There's no bet to call on the turn (amount to call is 0).\n\nI should consider:\n1. If MiniMax-M2 has a King, they likely have a better kicker than me\n2. They could have a flush draw\n3. They could have a straight draw\n4. They could be bluffing with air\n\nWith trips on a board with potential draws, I should bet for value and protection. I want to charge draws and get value from worse hands.\n\nThe pot is 9 chips. I should make a substantial bet - perhaps 6-8 chips to charge draws and get value.\n\nLet me make a value bet here.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**My hand:** Kd 6d - I have trip Kings (Kc Jc 9h Kh 4c)\n**Board:** Kc Jc 9h Kh 4c\n**Pot:** 25 chips\n**My stack:** 281 chips\n**Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4 with 176 chips\n\nI have trip Kings with a King on the board. The board is paired with Kc-Kh, and there are potential flush and straight draws that may have missed or completed.\n\nLet me review the hand action:\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called 2 (limped in)\n- Flop: I checked, MiniMax-M2 bet 2, I called\n- Turn: I bet 8, MiniMax-M2 called\n- River: I can check or bet\n\nThe opponent's action pattern (from the recall):\n- MiniMax-M2 has been relatively tight, folding preflop many times\n- When they do play, they tend to bet aggressively postflop (bet 2 on flop in hand 3, bet 2 on turn in hand 3)\n- In hand 6, they raised preflop, bet 8 on flop, bet 8 on turn, then checked river\n- They seem to be a straightforward player who bets with strength and checks when weak\n\n**Current situation analysis:**\n1. **My hand strength:** I have trip Kings, which is very strong. Only hands beating me are:\n   - KJ (full house)\n   - KK (quads - unlikely since I have Kd)\n   - Any pocket pair that made a full house (99, JJ)\n   - A hand like K9 or KJ would have me beat\n\n2. **Opponent's range:** \n   - They limped preflop, so unlikely to have premium pairs\n   - They bet the flop for 2 into a pot of 5 (40% pot)\n   - They called my turn bet of 8\n   - This suggests they have something - could be a King with weaker kicker, a flush draw, straight draw, or maybe a Jack\n\n3. **Board texture:**\n   - Two clubs on flop (Kc Jc), one club on river (4c) - flush possible\n   - Straight draws possible with Q-T, but no 8 or T on board to complete\n   - The 4c on river could complete a flush for someone holding two clubs\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies:**\n   - From the recall, MiniMax-M2 tends to bet when they have something\n   - They called my turn bet, suggesting they have some strength\n   - They haven't shown any bluffing tendencies\n\n5. **Decision:** I should bet for value here. I have trip Kings which is likely the best hand. I need to extract value from:\n   - Weaker Kings (Kx)\n   - Jacks (trip Jacks)\n   - Maybe 9s (trip 9s)\n   - Missed flush draws that might call a small bet\n\nThe pot is 25 chips. A value bet of around 50-60% pot (12-15 chips) seems appropriate. This allows weaker hands to call while protecting against the flush.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing. Since I can raise to minimum 8, but that's too small. I should bet around 15-20 chips for value. The minimum raise is 8, but I can raise to any amount above that. I'll bet 15 chips which is 60% of pot.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm in UTG position with A6 offsuit. My stack is 209 chips (104.5 BB). The blinds are 1/2. I need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been playing fairly tight - I folded KJ from UTG in hand #10, and folded 8T suited from UTG in hand #5. Now I have A6 offsuit, which is a marginal hand from UTG.\n\nFrom the opponent observations:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB) has shown some aggression - raised to 6 from UTG in hand #5, raised to 8 from SB in hand #12, and called raises. They have 291 chips.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has raised from BB with QsKs in hand #6, and folded to raises.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB) has raised preflop in hand #7 and hand #10.\n\nMy position is UTG, which is the worst position at the table. With A6 offsuit, this is a weak hand to open with. Ace-rag offsuit is generally a fold from UTG in most poker strategies because:\n1. It's dominated by better aces (AJ+, AQ, AK)\n2. It plays poorly postflop\n3. We're out of position against the entire table\n4. We have 3 players left to act behind us\n\nLooking at stack sizes, I have 104.5 BB, which is healthy. I don't need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands.\n\nThe pot odds: need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so getting 1.5:1 odds. But implied odds are poor because we're out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: I want to preserve my stack and wait for better spots. I've won 2 hands already (hand #8 with KJo from BTN, hand #13 with AQo from BTN), so I can afford to be patient.\n\nGiven all this, the correct play is to fold A6o from UTG. It's too weak to open, and calling just invites trouble from players behind.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific opponent tendencies that might change this decision. Looking at the search results, players have been fairly active, so opening with A6o could easily get raised behind me.\n\nI should fold.",

This could be effective because:\n1. It takes advantage of the opponent's tendency to check\n2. It denies equity to potential draws (flush draws, straight draws)\n3. It's a small investment that could win the pot immediately\n4. If called, I still have position and can make decisions on future streets\n \nI'll capitalize on the opponent's passive style by making a strategic small bet that could easily win the pot with minimal risk.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to make a decision here. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. My hand: Tc Qd (Ten of clubs, Queen of diamonds)\n2. Board: Kc Jc 9h Kh\n3. Position: BTN (Button)\n4. Stack: 184 chips (92 BB)\n5. Pot: 17 chips\n6. Seat 1 bet 8 chips on the turn\n7. Amount to call: 8 chips\n\nLooking at the board:\n- Kc Jc 9h Kh - this is a very coordinated board\n- I have Tc Qd - I have the nut flush draw (missing Ace of clubs)\n- I also have two overcards (Q and T) to the board\n- This gives me decent equity\n\nFrom the opponent analysis, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has shown aggressive betting patterns, including large bets in previous hands. This 8-chip bet into a 17-chip pot is about 47% pot sizing, which suggests they have a strong hand.\n\nMy options:\n1. Fold: This would preserve my stack but I'm giving up equity with a flush draw and overcards\n2. Call: This costs 8 chips and leaves me with 176 chips. I have decent equity to continue\n3. Raise: Minimum raise would be to 16 chips total, which would cost me 16 chips total (8 to call + 8 more). This would leave me with 168 chips.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have decent equity with flush draw + overcards\n- I'm in position on the button\n- I have a decent stack size (92 BB)\n- My win rate is only 23% so far, so I need to be selective about when to fold\n\nI think calling is the best play here. I have enough equity to continue, and calling preserves my tournament life while giving me a chance to improve on the river.\n\nLet me check my recent hand history to see if I should adjust my strategy...\n\n\nI've analyzed the hand history and see a pattern of tight, conservative play with a low win rate. While my previous hands show a tendency to fold or make small bets, this particular hand offers more potential. The flush draw and overcards provide enough equity to justify continuing. Calling the 8-chip bet keeps me in the game with a reasonable chance of improvement on the river, without risking too much of my stack.\n\nThe board's complexity - with potential straights, flushes, and full houses - suggests my opponent likely has a strong hand. This reinforces my decision to call rather than raise, preserving my chips while staying in the pot.",

I'll need to weigh the potential flush against the risk of being dominated by a better hand.\n\nMy stack position is relatively comfortable, so I can afford to take some calculated risks. The key is understanding whether my flush draw is truly strong enough to justify a call against this particular opponent's likely range.\n\nThe betting pattern reveals an interesting dynamic - the opponent seems to have a polarized strategy, potentially holding either a premium hand or a complete bluff. This suggests I can exploit the situation with a well-timed call or raise.\n\nMy flush draw with Tc Qd provides some equity, but it's not the nut flush. The presence of the Tc in my hand complicates my potential winning scenarios, as any Ace-high flush would outrank my current draw.\n\nI'll need to carefully evaluate the pot odds and my opponent's betting tendencies before making a definitive decision. The key factors are my current hand strength, potential outs, and the psychological aspect of the betting pattern.\n\nThe minimum raise requirement complicates my strategy. With only 176 chips and needing to invest 30, I'm considering the risk-reward of pushing all-in versus folding. The opponent's tight playing style suggests they might fold to aggression, but I'm also mindful of the potential for being called by a stronger hand.\n\nMy flush draw provides some equity, but it's not a guaranteed winning scenario.

With 15 chips to call and a pot of 40, I need about 27% equity to break even. My flush draw gives me 9 outs, but I'm not confident about the kicker. The opponent's betting pattern suggests they might have a strong hand, making my decision more complex. I'll need to weigh the potential flush against the risk of being dominated by a better hand.\n\nMy stack position is relatively comfortable, so I can afford to take some calculated risks. The key is understanding whether my flush draw is truly strong enough to justify a call against this particular opponent's likely range.\n\nThe betting pattern reveals an interesting dynamic - the opponent seems to have a polarized strategy, potentially holding either a premium hand or a complete bluff. This suggests I can exploit the situation with a well-timed call or raise.\n\nMy flush draw with Tc Qd provides some equity, but it's not the nut flush. The presence of the Tc in my hand complicates my potential winning scenarios, as any Ace-high flush would outrank my current draw.\n\nI'll need to carefully evaluate the pot odds and my opponent's betting tendencies before making a definitive decision. The key factors are my current hand strength, potential outs, and the psychological aspect of the betting pattern.\n\nThe minimum raise requirement complicates my strategy. With only 176 chips and needing to invest 30, I'm considering the risk-reward of pushing all-in versus folding. The opponent's tight playing style suggests they might fold to aggression, but I'm also mindful of the potential for being called by a stronger hand.\n\nMy flush draw provides some equity, but it's not a guaranteed winning scenario. I need to carefully weigh the pot odds against the potential risks of this hand.\n\nThe board composition reveals an interesting dynamic - while I have a club flush draw, there are potential full house combinations that could threaten my hand. The presence of paired Kings and Jacks means I must be cautious about my betting strategy.\n\nI'm calculating my position carefully. With a 40-chip pot and a 15-chip call, the math suggests a fold might be the most prudent decision. The risk-reward ratio doesn't favor aggressive play, especially considering the potential for my opponent to hold a stronger hand.\n\nThe minimum raise requirement of 30 chips adds another layer of complexity to my decision-making process. I'm weighing the potential return against the significant investment needed to continue in the hand.\n\nMy stack size and the current betting action suggest a strategic retreat might be the most rational approach at this point in the game.\n\nI'll carefully evaluate the betting patterns and potential hand combinations. The opponent's betting progression seems methodical, which could indicate either a strong hand or a calculated bluff. Their consistent betting from turn to river implies confidence, potentially signaling a premium hand like a full house or a well-disguised set.\n\nThe board's complex interactions - with clubs, paired kings, and potential straight possibilities - create an intricate decision matrix. I'm weighing the probability of my opponent holding a superior hand against the potential value of my current position.\n\nMy flush draw is compromised by the Ten of clubs, reducing",

Actually pot 5 chips. Amount to call is 1 (to match BB's raise). So we can call 1, raise minimum to 4 (i.e., total 4). Hand strength: 10-high, suited, low connectors, not great. In early position? SB is out of position post-flop. Stack 181, deep. Opponents: Kimi-K2 (BB) maybe unknown style; MiniMax called. Likely not a strong hand. With 3T suited, we could consider a raise to isolate? But raising from SB is risky, especially with weak hand. Better to fold or call? Call gives us chance to see flop out of position with a weak hand. Usually fold is correct with 3T suited in SB facing raise. So fold.\n\nWe must output JSON.",

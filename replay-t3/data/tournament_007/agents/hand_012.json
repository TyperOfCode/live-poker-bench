            "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket Kings (Ks Kc) in UTG position. This is the second-best starting hand in Texas Hold'em. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket Kings is an extremely strong hand, only behind pocket Aces. I should almost always play this hand aggressively.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in UTG (Under the Gun), which is the earliest position. This means I'll be out of position post-flop against most opponents. However, with such a strong hand, this is less concerning.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 226 chips (113 BB), which is a healthy stack. I can afford to play aggressively and build a pot.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the limited data I have:\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB) has folded in recent hands\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB) has raised to 4 chips in a previous hand\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) raised to 12 chips in one hand and folded to a raise in another\n   - The other Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has folded recently\n\n5. **Current Action**: It's 2 chips to call. I should definitely not fold. The question is whether to call or raise.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With a strong hand like KK, I want to build the pot and extract value. I also want to thin the field since being out of position with multiple callers is not ideal.\n\nGiven that I'm in early position with a premium hand, I should raise to:\n- Build the pot for value\n- Get information about opponents' hands\n- Thin the field\n- Take control of the hand\n\nA standard raise would be 3-4x the big blind. Since the BB is 2 chips, a raise to 6-8 chips would be appropriate. Given I'm in early position and want to charge opponents to see the flop, I'll go with a slightly larger raise.\n\nLet me raise to 8 chips (4x the BB). This is a solid, standard raise that builds the pot while still being able to fold if I face significant resistance (like a re-raise from a very tight player who might have Aces).\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I'm in UTG with Kings - this is a spot where I want to maximize value. A raise to 6-8 chips seems appropriate. I'll go with 8 chips to charge premiums and build the pot.",

The board is somewhat coordinated with two diamonds and straight possibilities.\n\nGiven that I have a monster hand and want to extract value:\n1. I should definitely bet/raise here\n2. I want to build the pot while I'm likely ahead\n3. I need to charge any flush draws or straight draws\n4. The opponent is tight, so they likely have something decent\n\nSince the amount to call is 0, I can check or raise. Checking might induce a bet from them if they have something, but betting myself is better because:\n- I have a strong hand and want to build the pot\n- The board is somewhat draw-heavy (flush draw, straight draw)\n- I can get value from top pair, two pair, or draws\n\nMinimum raise is 6 chips. Given the pot is 19, a bet of around 12-16 chips would be appropriate (2/3 to 3/4 pot).\n\nLet me make a solid value bet here.",

The fact that they called my preflop raise and called on the flop suggests they have something decent.\n\nLet me think about the board and my hand:\n- I have Ks Kc (pocket Kings)\n- Board: Ad Jc Kd 5c\n- I have a set of Kings (three of a kind)\n\nThis is a very strong hand! The only hand that beats me right now is:\n- Pocket Aces (but there's an Ace on the board, so they would have had Aces preflop)\n- Or they could have made a straight with Q-10 (but that seems unlikely given their tight play)\n\nGiven the board texture:\n- There's a flush draw possibility (clubs: Jc, 5c, and I have Ks so no club)\n- There's also a potential straight draw with Q-10\n- But my set of Kings is very strong\n\nThe pot is 51 chips, and I have 202 chips. I should definitely bet for value here. My opponent has shown they call with decent hands, and they've been tight, so if they call my flop bet, they likely have something.\n\nSince there's no bet to me (amount to call is 0), I should bet. The minimum raise is 16, but that's just the minimum - I should bet more for value.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing:\n- Pot is 51\n- I could bet 30-40 chips (60-80% pot) to get value from hands like:\n  - AJ (top pair)\n  - AQ (top pair)\n  - KQ (two pair)\n  - Any flush draws\n  - Any straight draws\n\nGiven how tight my opponent has been, they're likely to have a strong hand that can call a decent sized bet.\n\nI'll go with a bet of around 35-40 chips for value.",

            "reasoning_content": "  I have a very strong hand - I have a set of Kings (Ks Kc) on a board of Ad Jc Kd 5c 3c. This gives me three Kings. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have SET of Kings (K-K-K). This is extremely strong. The board shows Ad Jc Kd 5c 3c. The only hands that beat me are:\n   - A-A (set of Aces) - very unlikely given the action\n   - J-J (set of Jacks) - possible but unlikely\n   - K-K (we have both Kings, so impossible)\n   - A-K (two pair) - we beat this\n   - Any straight? No, the board is not connected enough for a straight\n   - Any flush? The board has 3 clubs (Jc, 5c, 3c), so a flush is possible if opponent has two clubs\n\n2. **Action History**:\n   - Preflop: I raised to 8, opponent called\n   - Flop: I bet 16, opponent called\n   - Turn: I bet 40, opponent called\n   - River: I'm first to act (BB)\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: Looking at the opponent's history, Seat 2 has been very tight - folding preflop in hands 3-11. They only played hands 1 and 2. In hand 2, they raised preflop but folded on the flop. This suggests they're a tight player who only plays strong hands.\n\n4. **Pot Size**: The pot is 131 chips. My stack is 162 chips.\n\n5. **Board Texture**: There are 3 clubs on board, so a flush is possible. Also, there's an Ace and Jack, so two pair combinations like A-J, A-K, J-K are possible.\n\nGiven that my opponent has called two streets of betting (flop and turn), they likely have something. The fact that they've been very tight suggests they have a real hand. Possible hands they could have:\n- A-x (top pair)\n- J-x (second pair)\n- Two pair (A-J, A-K, J-K)\n- A flush draw that hit on the river\n- A set of Aces or Jacks\n- K-x (but we have both Kings)\n\nSince I'm out of position and my opponent has shown strength by calling twice, I should check here. If I bet and they have a flush or a better hand, I could lose a lot. If I check, I can see what they do - if they bet, I can evaluate based on the size.\n\nActually, wait. I have a very strong hand. The pot is 131 and I have 162 left. Let me reconsider:\n\n- If I check and they have a missed draw, they might check back and I lose value\n- If I bet, I can get value from worse hands\n\nGiven the opponent is tight and has called twice, they likely have at least top pair or a draw that hit. But my hand is VERY strong - only losing to sets of Aces or Jacks, or a flush.\n\nI think checking is too passive. I should bet for value. \n\nI'll carefully consider the betting strategy. With a pot-sized bet around 131 chips, I need to balance extracting value and protecting my stack. A strategic bet of 60-80 chips could maximize my potential winnings while managing risk. This approach allows me to get value from strong but inferior hands, while keeping some flexibility if the opponent shows unexpected strength.",

This is a reasonably strong hand given the board texture.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the button, which is advantageous.\n\n**Opponent Information**: I have limited information about this specific opponent, but I can see they're the player who raised preflop and is now betting on the flop.\n\n**Pot Odds**: The pot is 35 chips and I need to call 16, giving me about 2.2:1 pot odds. This is favorable for a call with second pair.\n\n**Board Texture**: The board is quite coordinated with two Broadway cards (A and K) and a possible flush draw. This could connect well with a preflop raiser's range.\n\n**Decision**: While my hand is decent, I need to be cautious about the strength of my opponent's range on this board. They've shown strength by raising preflop and betting this coordinated flop. I should call to see the turn card, as folding would be too tight given the pot odds and my hand strength.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Second pair with good pot odds (2.2:1), calling to see the turn card\"\n}",

While I have middle pair, the aggressive betting from Seat 1 suggests they likely have:\n- An Ace (top pair)\n- A King (second pair)\n- Or a strong draw\n\nGiven my pot odds and position, I should call here to see the river and re-evaluate.

My stack is 194 chips (97 BB). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 8 (4 BB) from early position, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Seat 1 has been folding preflop in recent hands but previously showed down 9d8d and 9s8c - seems to play speculative hands. Seat 2 has been folding preflop in all recent hands but now called a raise.\n\nMy hand Kh9c is marginal, especially from the small blind. King-high with 9 kicker offsuit. Against a raise and a call, I'm likely behind. The pot odds: I need to call 7 to win 19+7=26, so about 3.7:1 odds (27% equity needed).\n\nHowever, I'm out of position (SB) for the entire hand, which is a big disadvantage. With Kh9c, I have some high card potential but the 9 kicker is weak. Against a raiser and caller, I could be dominated by better kings or pairs.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy 97 BB stack. No need to take marginal spots out of position. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nI should also consider the possibility of raising to isolate or squeeze, but with Kh9c and out of position, that's risky. The minimum raise would be to 14 total (6 more than the call). But my hand isn't strong enough for that.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot.",

Td2d isn't strong enough for multi-way play, especially from out of position.\n\nGiven that I'm getting 3:1 pot odds but the hand doesn't have strong immediate value and I'm out of position against what appears to be two decent holdings, I should fold to preserve my stack.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Folding Td2d in small blind facing a call against two opponents who seem to have decent hands.

They've been folding preflop quite a bit but are now raising.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): This player has been folding A LOT - 10 consecutive folds in recent hands. They're now calling a raise, which suggests they have something decent.\n\nWith Td2d, I have:\n- Suited connectors with potential for flush draws\n- Straight possibilities\n- Low pair potential (though 2s are weak)\n\nThe pot odds: I need to call 6 to win 19, so I'm getting about 3:1 pot odds. This is decent for a drawing hand.\n\nHowever, I need to consider:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. Two players are already in the hand with decent stacks\n\n\n3. Td2d isn't a premium hand for multi-way play\n4. I'm getting decent pot odds but need to consider implied odds\n\nI'll evaluate the hand's potential carefully. The suited connectors offer some drawing possibilities, but with multiple opponents and out of position, the risks are significant. The 3:1 pot odds might not compensate for the challenging scenario. I'm leaning towards folding, as the hand lacks strong immediate strength and positioning disadvantages could limit my ability to realize potential gains.\n\nThe tournament context and stack considerations further support a cautious approach. With two opponents and limited positional advantage, folding seems the most prudent strategy to preserve my tournament standing.\n",

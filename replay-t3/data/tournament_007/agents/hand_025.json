Let me analyze:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have A4 offsuit (4c As) in the SB\n- Stack: 250 chips (62.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 47 chips\n- Facing a raise from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) of 41 chips\n- Amount to call: 39 chips\n- Position: SB (bad position postflop)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- GPT-OSS-120B has been very passive, folding most hands\n- In hand #24, they made a small raise of 8 chips\n- In hand #18, they checked through the entire hand\n- They have 0 chips now, which means they went all-in for 41 chips\n\nWait, the data shows \"GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out)\" which means they just went all-in for their remaining 41 chips. This is a shove.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength**: A4o is a marginal hand, especially from SB\n2. **Pot odds**: I need to call 39 to win 47 (pot) + 39 (my call) = 86 chips. That's about 45% equity needed\n3. **Opponent's range**: Since this player has been very passive and now shoves, their range is likely strong. They could have: pairs (22+), strong Ax hands (A10+), broadway cards\n4. **Tournament situation**: I have a healthy stack of 62.5 BB. Risking 39 chips (15.6% of my stack) with A4o against a likely strong range is not ideal\n5. **Position**: I'll be out of position postflop if I call, but since opponent is all-in, there's no postflop play\n\nLet me calculate the equity of A4o against a typical shoving range:\n- Against a tight range (66+, AJs+, AQo+): ~30% equity\n- Against a wider range (22+, A2s+, KTs+, QJs, ATo+): ~38% equity\n\nGiven the pot odds require ~45% equity, and I'm likely behind their range, this is a fold.\n\nThe fact that this opponent has been very passive and suddenly shoves suggests real strength. They wouldn't do this lightly.\n\n**Decision**: Fold",

Position: UTG is the worst position - you have to act first\n3. Stack size: 258 chips (64.5 BB) - decent stack\n4. Blinds: 2/4 - small blinds\n5. Amount to call: 4 chips (1 BB)\n6. Minimum raise to: 8 chips (2 BB)\n\nWith this weak hand in UTG position, I should be folding. 4-10 offsuit has very little value, especially when acting first.

If we call 4, we just see flop with 9s, but we are still short. Better to go all-in to maximize chance to double. So raise all-in (to 41).

This is favorable for a call with second pair.\n\n**Board Texture**: The board is quite coordinated with two Broadway cards (A and K) and a possible flush draw. This could connect well with a preflop raiser's range.\n\n**Decision**: While my hand is decent, I need to be cautious about the strength of my opponent's range on this board.

The opponent has shown significant strength, betting into an ace-high flop and continuing on the turn and river.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 211 chips\n- Need to call 80 chips\n- Getting about 2.6:1 on the call\n\n**My hand strength:**\nI have jack high with one pair (jacks). Given the betting pattern, my opponent likely has:\n- An ace (for a pair of aces or better)\n- A king (for a pair of kings)\n- Some other strong hand\n\nThe river bet of 80 into a 131 chip pot is a large bet, suggesting they want to get value from a strong hand.\n\nWith my jack pair facing this aggressive action on an ace-high board, I believe I'm beat. Folding seems like the correct play here.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Facing large river bet after aggressive betting all streets.

Their check on this flop suggests they may have missed or have a marginal hand.\n\n3. **My recent pattern**: I've been folding frequently (13 out of 14 hands), which suggests I'm playing tight. \n\n4. **Position and pot**: I'm out of position in the big blind. The pot is small (6 chips), and there's nothing to call.\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: I have 63 BB remaining, which is a healthy stack but I need to be selective about when I invest chips.\n\nWith K-high and a gutshot draw, this is a marginal situation. The opponent's check could indicate weakness, but I have no showdown value and limited outs. Since I'm out of position and have been playing tight, I should continue with my conservative approach and check to see what develops on the turn.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K-high with gutshot draw in marginal spot.

With AKs and two overcards plus backdoor potential, I have enough equity to continue. Calling keeps the pot manageable and allows me to potentially hit my hand or evaluate on later streets.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"AKs has 6 clean outs plus backdoor potential.

This is favorable for a call with second pair.\n\n**Board Texture**: The board is quite coordinated with two Broadway cards (A and K) and a possible flush draw. This could connect well with a preflop raiser's range.\n\n**Decision**: While my hand is decent, I need to be cautious about the strength of my opponent's range on this board.

While I have middle pair, the aggressive betting from Seat 1 suggests they likely have:\n- An Ace (top pair)\n- A King (second pair)\n- Or a strong draw\n\nGiven my pot odds and position, I should call here to see the river and re-evaluate. Folding would be too tight given the pot odds and my hand strength.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Middle pair with good pot odds (3.3:1) and position.

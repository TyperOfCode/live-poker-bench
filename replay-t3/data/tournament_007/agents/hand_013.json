Standard play would be to fold. Even with the ace, this hand plays poorly postflop, especially out of position against multiple opponents.\n\nI should fold this hand.

AQo is a premium hand that plays well postflop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position at the table. I get to act last on every postflop street, giving me a significant advantage.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 194 chips (97 BB), which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2, so we're playing deep stacked poker.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression - raised in hand #6 and #11, but folded many other times. Showed Qs Ks in hand #6.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised big in hand #10 (12 chips), but also folded often. Showed As 5h in hand #9.\n\n5. **Action**: Everyone folded to me on the button. I'm facing just the blinds (SB and BB). The amount to call is 2 chips (the BB). I can fold, call, or raise.\n\n6. **Strategic considerations**:\n   - With AQo on the button against only the blinds, this is a clear raise situation.\n   - Raising puts pressure on the blinds and allows me to take the pot preflop often.\n   - Even if called, I have position and a strong hand.\n   - Standard raise size would be 3-4x the BB (6-8 chips) or potentially larger given deep stacks.\n\n7. **My history**: I've been fairly tight (only 1 win in 12 hands, mostly folding). A raise here with AQo would be appropriate and show some aggression.\n\nGiven that the minimum raise is to 4 chips (total), I should raise to around 6-8 chips. Let's go with 6 chips (3x BB), which is a standard raise size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 6,\n  \"reasoning\": \"AQo on button vs blinds is a strong raising hand.

I have overcards to the T (Ace and Queen are both higher than Ten). No flush draws for me, but I do have backdoor straight potential if a J and K come. The board is paired with 2s, which reduces the likelihood opponent has trips (though possible).\n\n2. **Opponent Analysis:** From the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has only checked or called on flops in previous hands. This is their first flop bet we've seen. They called my preflop raise from the BB, so their range could be wide: pocket pairs, suited connectors, Broadway cards, etc. The small bet of 8 into 21 (about 38% pot) could be a probe bet with a weak hand, a value bet with a medium pair, or a draw.\n\n3. **Pot Odds:** I need to call 8 to win 29 (21+8). That's about 3.6:1 pot odds, or 27.6% equity needed. Against a range of hands that might bet this flop (pairs, draws, some bluffs), AQ likely has around 30-40% equity. So pot odds are favorable.\n\n4. **Position:** I have position advantage (button) which is valuable. I can see what opponent does on turn before acting.\n\n5. **Stack Sizes:** Both stacks are deep (94 BB effective). This allows for post-flop play.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I have a healthy stack. Being aggressive with position and a decent hand makes sense.\n\n**Decision:** I should call. Reasons:\n- Good pot odds (27.6% equity needed, AQ likely has more)\n- Position advantage\n- Opponent's first flop bet could be weak\n- Overcards have decent equity against many hands\n- If I hit an Ace or Queen on turn, I can win a big pot\n- If I miss, I can reevaluate on turn\n\nA raise could also be considered to take initiative, but with a paired board and opponent's first aggression, calling seems more prudent to keep the pot controlled and use position."

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the current situation. I'm on the button with Qd Ah (Ace-Queen offsuit). The board is 2d 2c Tc 4s (paired deuces, ten, four). The pot is 29 chips. The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) in seat 5 checked to me on the turn. I have 180 chips (90 BB), opponent has 182 chips.\n\nI raised preflop to 6 (3x BB), opponent called. On the flop (2d 2c Tc), opponent bet 8 into a pot of ~13, I called. Now turn is 4s, opponent checks.\n\nMy hand: AQ offsuit. I have Ace high with a Queen kicker. Board is 2d 2c Tc 4s. I have no pair, no draw. Best I have is Ace high with backdoor straight possibilities (needs K and J for Broadway, or 5 and 3 for wheel). Actually, with Q-A, I need specifically K-J for straight, or 5-3 for wheel. Not great.\n\nOpponent's range: They called my preflop raise from BB. Could have a wide range: any pocket pair, suited connectors, broadway cards, etc. On flop they bet 8 into ~13. Could be betting a ten, a pocket pair above ten, a flush draw (though only one club on board), or a bluff. Now they check turn.\n\nGiven they checked turn, they might be giving up with a weak hand, or they might have a medium strength hand and want to check-call. Could also be trapping with a monster like 2x or TT.\n\nI should consider betting for value/protection. With Ace high, I could try to take it down now. But I need to think about opponent's tendencies. From the data, GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop twice (hand 7 and 10), folded preflop 4 times, called once. Not enough data on post-flop play. Only one hand went to showdown (hand 9) where they checked all streets.\n\nPot is 29, I could bet maybe 15-20 to apply pressure. If opponent calls, I'm likely behind. But if they fold, I win the pot. My stack is 180, betting 20 is reasonable.\n\nAlternatively, I could check back and try to improve on river. But with Ace high, improving is unlikely unless I hit an Ace or Queen (6 outs). Actually, 3 Aces + 3 Queens = 6 outs. That's about 12% chance to hit on river. Not great.\n\nI think a moderate bet is best. If opponent raises, I can fold. If they call, I need to re-evaluate on river.\n\nLet me check if there are any flush draws: board has 2d 2c Tc 4s. Only one club, so no flush draw. Straight draws possible: someone could have 53 for open-ended, or A3 for gutshot, or J9 for open-ended. But with my AQ, I block some of those.\n\nI'll bet about 18 chips (half pot to 2/3 pot). That seems reasonable.",

Usually order: SB seat4, BB seat5, then seat1 UTG, seat2, seat3, etc. But given seat1 and seat2 folded, seat3 raised. So we face a raise of 6, need to call 4.\n\nOur hand: 7h Th. It's a decent suited connector, decent potential for straight and flush, but not premium. Stack 194 chips ~97 BB, deep. Facing a raise of 3BB from presumably early position (maybe middle). We need to decide.\n\nWe should consider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 raised 6 previously (hand #8). Might be a standard raise range. We could call to see flop, but also could raise (3-bet) as a semi-bluff? 7hTh is not a strong 3-bet hand; could 3-bet for value vs weaker range? Probably not advisable. Better to call and see flop, especially with deep stack.\n\nBut also consider position: we are in BB, out of position post-flop. However, 7hTh is a decent hand to call in BB vs a raise from early position? Might be borderline. In tournaments early stage (blinds 1/2, stack 97 BB), we can be more liberal. The raise is 3BB, not huge. So calling is fine.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nWe must ensure raise_to is null.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have hand #13 on flop. Board: 2d 2c Tc. Our hand: 7h Th. So we have top pair (Tens) with a flush draw? Actually we have Ten of hearts, board has Ten of clubs. So we have a pair of tens, plus a straight draw? 7-8-9-10? No board has 2,2,T. So we have a pair of tens, kicker 7. Not great but top pair. Opponent (Seat3) raised preflop to 6 (from UTG maybe). He is DeepSeek-V3.2. We called. Now flop with pair on board: 2-2-T. He hasn't acted yet? The actions list only includes preflop. So now it's our turn (BB) after flop? Actually order: In flop, action starts with UTG (Seat3) then Seat4 (fold) then Seat5 (BB) etc. Since Seat3 raised preflop and we called, now flop action is first to act UTG (Seat3). The action list doesn't show any flop actions yet; it's our turn? Usually after flop, action starts with UTG (first active player left of button). That is Seat3. Since no flop actions listed, it's currently Seat3's turn? But the prompt says \"Your Position: BB (Seat5)\". And \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests it's our turn to act and nothing to call (i.e., previous player checked). So the opponent must have checked the flop. So we have the option to check or raise. We have top pair, decent hand. Opponent's tendencies unknown. Let's recall opponent actions on flop. Use recall_opponent_actions again for preflop maybe? But we can infer that he raised preflop and now checked flop. Could be a continuation bet? He didn't bet. So maybe he missed the flop, so checking suggests a weak hand. Could be a trap? But likely he's weak. So we could consider raising to protect our hand and extract value. Our stack is 190 chips, pot 13. Minimum raise is 4, meaning we can raise to 4 total? Actually raise to 4 means total bet of 4? Minimum raise to: 4 meaning we must put at least 4 chips total (i.e., raise 4). Since amount to call 0, raising to 4 would be a bet of 4 chips. That's small. Could we raise larger? Yes, we can raise any amount above min raise. We could bet maybe 8-10 chips to protect and get value. Opponent's stack 188, pot 13. A bet of say 8 would be about 1.5 BB. Might be fine.\n\nConsider tournament stage: early, stacks 95 BB, we can be aggressive. Opponent raised preflop, maybe strong. But flop is dry with 2-2-T. Our T is top pair, but opponent could have T with stronger kicker (like AJ, QJ, etc.) or a set of twos (unlikely). Also could have overcards like AK. But he checked, maybe he missed. So raising is good.\n\nThus action: raise to maybe 8 chips. Provide reasoning.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise allowed. So output JSON.\n\n",

No. Overpair? Not overpair, it's pair. Straight possibilities: board has 2-2- T-4. We have 7, could get straight draw with 8-9? Not currently. So only pair.\n\nOpponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised preflop to 6 (from UTG maybe). We called with 7h Th from BB. Flop 2d 2c Tc: we bet 8, opponent called 8. So flop we led out, maybe representing strong. Opponent called.\n\nTurn 4s: we check, opponent bets 18 into pot 47? Actually pot after flop: preflop pot: 1+2+6+4 =13? Wait: preflop: SB 1, BB 2, raise 6, call 4 => total 1+2+6+4 =13? Actually raise to 6 includes the 2 from BB? No, raise 6 means total 6? Usually raise to 6 after SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6 from seat3, call 4 from seat5 (BB). So pot after preflop: 1+2+6+4 =13.\n\nFlop: we bet 8, opponent call 8 => pot now 13+8+8 =29. Turn: we check, opponent bets 18 => pot becomes 29+18 =47 (as given). So we need to decide.\n\nOur hand: top pair (tens) with weak kicker. Opponent's range: preflop raise from UTG (likely strong). They called flop bet, maybe they have T? Could be 2 pair (2s with T), set of 2s, or maybe a straight draw (like 9J, 8J, etc). Turn card 4s gives them maybe a flush draw? No spades: only 4s, we have no spades. So they could have a flush draw with spades? Actually board spade only 4s. They could have two spades in hand, giving flush draw. Not many combos.\n\nOur check might be considered weak; opponent bets. Should we call? Evaluate pot odds: pot 47, bet 18, so total pot after call 65. Need to call 18 to win 65 => odds 18/65 = 27.7%. Need equity >27.7%. Our hand vs opponent's range.\n\nWhat could opponent have? Since they raised preflop UTG, likely strong: high pairs (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT), AK, AQ, maybe A2s? They called flop bet, indicating they have decent hand or draw. Board: 2d 2c Tc. Our bet on flop could have been with T, we have T. Opponent may have 2x for set, or T? Could have overpair (AA, KK) that still call? Overpairs would call a small bet. Could also have straight draw like 9J (gives open-ended) or 8J? Actually board T,2,2. 9J gives gutshot? 9J would need 8 or Q for straight. Not immediate.\n\nTurn 4s: board now 2-2-T-4. This gives potential for a straight 3-4-5-6? Not relevant.\n\nOpponent bet 18, maybe representing a made hand like set of 2s, two pair (T2), or maybe a bluff.\n\nOur hand is weak top pair. Likely behind many of opponent's strong hands. But also many draws (flush draw spades, straight draws). Should we call? With 7h Th, we have backdoor flush? No hearts on board. Not.\n\nWe could raise? Minimum raise to 36, raising to 36 would be +18 extra. Does that make sense? Probably not.\n\nWe could fold to preserve stack. Our stack 182, still decent.\n\nGiven we have only top pair with weak kicker, and opponent's range is likely ahead, folding seems appropriate.\n\nBut we need to consider possibility opponent is semi-bluffing with spade flush draw. If they have spade flush draw, they have maybe A5s, K5s, etc. Our call would be okay if equity >27.7% vs that."

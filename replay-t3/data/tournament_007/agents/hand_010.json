The current raise to 12 is a significant bet (6x BB), which suggests real strength.\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm in SB, which is terrible position\n- I have a healthy stack of 113 BB\n- Calling would commit 11 chips (about 5% of my stack) with a very weak hand\n- Even if I hit something, I'll be out of position postflop\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot before raise: 15 chips (1+2+12)\n- To call: 11 chips\n- Pot odds: 15:11 or about 1.36:1\n- This is nowhere near enough to justify calling with 57o\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- Early tournament stage (Hand #10)\n- I have a healthy stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands\n- Preserve chips for better spots\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a trivial fold. 57o from SB facing a 6x BB raise is a clear fold. The opponent's raise sizing suggests strength, I'm out of position, and the hand has almost no potential.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze the current situation. I have KJo (Jh Kd) in UTG position with 98.5 BB stack. This is a marginal hand in early position. Looking at the history:\n\n1. In hand #8, I had KJo on the button and raised to 6 (3x) and won the blinds. That was in late position though.\n2. From the opponent observations, Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raised preflop in hand #1 from BB position (raised to 8, 4x BB). Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1) raised preflop in hand #5 from UTG (raised to 6, 3x BB). So both Kimi players are capable of raising.\n\nMy position is UTG, which is the worst position to play from. KJo offsuit is not a strong hand - it's generally folded from early positions in tournament poker. With 5 players left to act behind me, I could easily face raises.\n\nHowever, the blinds are small (1/2) relative to stacks, so there's some room to see a flop cheaply. But if I just call, I risk being raised by later positions.\n\nLooking at stack sizes: everyone has similar stacks around 190-226 chips (95-113 BB). No one is short-stacked.\n\nStandard tournament strategy: Fold KJo from UTG. It's a hand that can get you into trouble - dominated by AK, AQ, KQ, and even KJ suited. When you hit a pair, you're often behind better kings or jacks.\n\nGiven my history of mostly folding (8 folds out of 9 hands), I need to be selective. I won one hand with KJo on the button, but that's different from UTG.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. Let me consider alternatives:\n- Call: Risk being raised, out of position with a marginal hand\n- Raise: With KJo UTG, I'd be raising into 4 players, likely only getting called by better hands\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger spot. I have a healthy stack (98.5 BB), no need to play marginal hands from early position.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

The pot odds aren't compelling enough to justify entering with this marginal hand when I have plenty of chips and can wait for better spots.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"UTG with 9d Js is too weak to play from the worst position.

I'm in UTG with a weak hand (9d Js)\n2. The opponents have shown mixed patterns but I have no position\n3. I have a healthy stack and can wait for better spots\n4. From UTG, I should be playing very tight\n\n\n5. The risk of calling with this marginal hand outweighs potential gains\n\nI'll confidently fold, recognizing this isn't a strategic opportunity worth pursuing. The hand's weakness and my poor position make folding the most prudent decision.\n",

So we can call 2, raise to at least 4 (i.e., raise 2 more). Our hand QJ offsuit (different suits). Position button. Stack 193, deep. Need to decide.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (seat2 BB) has raised preflop in past two hands: amounts 8 and 6 (over 2). That suggests they are raising 3-4x BB maybe as standard open raise? Could be a 3-bet? Actually they are BB, they cannot raise preflop unless someone raised before them. Wait seat1 SB posted 1, seat2 BB posted 2. No raise yet. So seat2 cannot raise preflop unless they are the first aggressor (open raise). So they are opening from BB (tight? maybe). They raised to 8 and 6 previously, which are 4x BB and 3x BB. So they are likely a standard raiser, perhaps tightish.\n\nOur hand QJ offsuit is decent but not premium. In BTN vs BB open, we can 3-bet or call. With deep stacks, we could raise to isolate. But need to consider tournament stage: we have 96.5 BB, deep, can be aggressive.\n\nGiven opponent's raises are 6-8 (3-4x), they may be opening a wide range? Not sure. QJ offsuit can be played profitably by 3-betting to apply pressure, especially on button. But also could call and see flop.\n\nWhat is pot size? 3 chips currently (SB+BB). If we raise to 4 (minimum), that is just a small raise (2 more). That would be a 2x raise (to 4). That might be too small, not standard. Could raise to maybe 12 (6x) to isolate. Minimum raise to 4, but we can raise higher. Need to consider legal raise amounts? Not specified, but we can raise to any amount up to our stack. Usually raise must be at least double the previous bet (so raise to at least 4). So we could raise to, say, 12.\n\nGiven opponent's typical open is 6-8, raising to 12 would be a 6x raise (3x BB). Might be a good 3-bet.\n\nBut also consider that we could just call and see flop, but QJ offsuit is vulnerable.\n\nI think we should raise to 12 to isolate and take initiative. Reason: position, decent hand, deep stacks, opponent likely raises wide.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 12.\n\nNow produce JSON."

So we can call 2, raise to at least 4 (i.e., raise 2 more). Our hand QJ offsuit (different suits). Position button. Stack 193, deep. Need to decide.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (seat2 BB) has raised preflop in past two hands: amounts 8 and 6 (over 2). That suggests they are raising 3-4x BB maybe as standard open raise? Could be a 3-bet? Actually they are BB, they cannot raise preflop unless someone raised before them. Wait seat1 SB posted 1, seat2 BB posted 2. No raise yet. So seat2 cannot raise preflop unless they are the first aggressor (open raise). So they are opening from BB (tight? maybe). They raised to 8 and 6 previously, which are 4x BB and 3x BB. So they are likely a standard raiser, perhaps tightish.\n\nOur hand QJ offsuit is decent but not premium. In BTN vs BB open, we can 3-bet or call. With deep stacks, we could raise to isolate. But need to consider tournament stage: we have 96.5 BB, deep, can be aggressive.\n\nGiven opponent's raises are 6-8 (3-4x), they may be opening a wide range? Not sure. QJ offsuit can be played profitably by 3-betting to apply pressure, especially on button. But also could call and see flop.\n\nWhat is pot size? 3 chips currently (SB+BB). If we raise to 4 (minimum), that is just a small raise (2 more). That would be a 2x raise (to 4). That might be too small, not standard. Could raise to maybe 12 (6x) to isolate. Minimum raise to 4, but we can raise higher. Need to consider legal raise amounts? Not specified, but we can raise to any amount up to our stack. Usually raise must be at least double the previous bet (so raise to at least 4). So we could raise to, say, 12.\n\nGiven opponent's typical open is 6-8, raising to 12 would be a 6x raise (3x BB). Might be a good 3-bet.\n\nBut also consider that we could just call and see flop, but QJ offsuit is vulnerable.\n\nI think we should raise to 12 to isolate and take initiative. Reason: position, decent hand, deep stacks, opponent likely raises wide.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 12.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

This is generally a marginal hand at best.\n\n**Position & Stack**: I'm on the button with 90 chips (5.6 BB), which puts me in the short-stack danger zone where I need to be selective.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: From my memory, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been quite active and aggressive, with recent preflop raises in hands #60 and #61. They've also shown capability for aggressive post-flop play, suggesting they likely have solid hands when they raise.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (24:8), which might seem tempting, but...\n\n**Key Considerations**:\n1. With only 5.6 BB, I'm in critical short-stack territory\n2. The opponent's recent aggression suggests they likely have a decent hand\n3. 4c 5s has very little equity against a likely raising range\n4. I need to preserve my chips to stay competitive in the tournament\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. While the pot odds are decent, the combination of a very weak hand, an aggressive opponent, and my short-stack situation makes this an easy decision to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"4c 5s is too weak to call against an aggressive opponent with 5.6 BB stack. Need to preserve chips for better opportunities.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 4c 5s - This is a very weak suited connector with little straight/flush potential. With 90 chips (5.6 BB), I'm relatively short-stacked.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is a good position, but with this weak hand it's not particularly advantageous.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Kimi-K2 Thinking has 804 chips and seems to be quite active. From the memory:\n   - They've been raising preflop recently (hand #60: raise 24, hand #61: raise 64)\n   - They're capable of aggressive post-flop play (multiple raises on flop/turn in hand #57)\n   - But they've also shown some restraint (checking/folding in other hands)\n\n4. **Situation**: \n   - Current pot: 24 chips\n   - I need to call 8 chips to stay in\n   - Minimum raise would be to 32 chips total\n   - I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (24:8)\n\n5. **Analysis**:\n   - 4c 5s is generally a fold in most situations, especially when facing action\n   - However, being on the button gives me position for post-flop play\n   - The pot odds are decent (3:1), but I need to consider implied odds with my short stack\n   - With only 5.6 BB, I'm in the danger zone where I might get pushed out by larger stacks\n   - Kimi-K2 has been raising preflop recently, suggesting they might have a decent hand\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**:\n   - At 5.6 BB, I'm short-stacked and need to be careful about chip preservation\n   - However, I also need to accumulate chips to stay competitive\n   - With 90 chips, I can afford to see a flop if the price is right\n   \nI see the mathematical reality clearly. The hand's weakness combined with aggressive opponent tendencies makes this a straightforward decision. Despite the favorable button position and decent pot odds, the risks of playing 4c 5s against an active raiser outweigh potential gains. Folding is the most prudent strategy to preserve my limited chip stack.\n",

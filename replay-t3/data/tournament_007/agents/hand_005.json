            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - excellent position\n- Cards: 7s 7d - pocket sevens, a medium pocket pair\n- Stack: 199 chips (99.5 BB) - very healthy stack\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- To call: 1 chip (additional to my SB)\n- Can raise to minimum 4 chips\n\n**Opponent Information:**\nLooking at the recall data for Kimi-K2 in Seat 2 (the BB):\n- Hand 1: Preflop raise 8 (I was in SB that hand and folded)\n- Hand 2: Preflop raise 6, then folded on flop\n- Hand 3: Preflop fold\n- Hand 4: Preflop fold\n\nSo the BB has been somewhat active but has folded the last 2 hands. They seem to raise fairly often when they play (8 and 6 chips).\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket sevens is a strong hand preflop, especially in position. It flops a set about 12% of the time and is ahead of most non-paired hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button - the best position postflop. This allows me to control the pot size and get maximum value.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 99.5 BB, which is excellent. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendency**: BB has been raising preflop when they play, but they've also folded the last 2 hands. They might be getting tighter or just had weak hands.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 1 more chip to win a pot of 3 chips (2.5:1 odds). This is an easy call with pocket sevens.\n\n**Decision**: \n- Just calling is an option, but with pocket pairs, we want to either:\n  a) Raise to isolate and take control, or\n  b) Call to see a cheap flop and try to hit a set\n\nGiven I'm on the button with 99.5 BB, I should raise here. Pocket sevens plays well as a raising hand in position because:\n- I can fold to a 3-bet if necessary\n- I can take control of the hand postflop\n- I can build a pot when I'm likely ahead\n- I can represent strong hands on various board textures\n\nA standard raise would be 3-4x the BB, so 6-8 chips given the 2 chip BB. Since minimum is 4, I should raise to at least 6. Let me raise to 6 to keep it standard and see how the BB responds.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's pattern, they raised to 6 and 8 in previous hands. A raise to 6 keeps me consistent with their sizing and is a standard 3x raise (2 BB x 3 = 6).",

At 98.5 BB deep, I have room to play some speculative hands, but UTG is the worst position to play from.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 has raised twice preflop (8 chips and 6 chips) and folded twice. Seems somewhat aggressive.\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has been more passive, calling and checking mostly.\n\nMy hand (8\u2666 T\u2666) is a suited connector, which has good implied odds when it hits, but from UTG with many players left to act, it's marginal. The pot is 3 chips, and I need to call 2 chips. That's 1:1.5 pot odds, which isn't great.\n\nGiven my position and the fact that there are 4 players left to act behind me (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, Kimi-K2 Thinking in SB, Kimi-K2 in BB), this hand is too weak to open from UTG. Even if I call, I could face a raise from later positions, and then I'd have to fold after putting in chips.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 197 chips (98.5 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands from early position.\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger hand in a better position. Fold is the correct play here.",

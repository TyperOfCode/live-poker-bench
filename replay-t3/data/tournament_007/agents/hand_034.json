            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the Button with 8d 8c (pocket eights)\n- My stack: 336 chips (84 BB)\n- Only opponent: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) in BB with 8 chips\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- I need to call 2 more chips to see the flop\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at Seat 2's recent actions:\n- Hand 29: Preflop fold\n- Hand 30: Preflop raise to 24 chips (very large raise)\n- Hand 31: Preflop fold  \n- Hand 32: Called 29, then bet 45 on flop, then folded\n- Hand 33: Raised to 12 preflop, then raised to 120 (all-in), checked flop, folded turn\n\nThis player seems aggressive and willing to play big pots. They went all-in in hand 33. They're currently very short-stacked with only 8 chips (2 BB).\n\n**Hand strength:**\n8-8 is a decent hand, especially heads-up. Against a random hand, 8-8 has about 70% equity. Against a short-stacked opponent, this is a very strong hand.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm on the Button, which is great position post-flop (though position matters less when opponent is all-in).\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- I have 336 chips (84 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent has only 8 chips (2 BB) - extremely short\n- This is a tournament, so eliminating opponents is valuable\n\n**Decision:**\nWith pocket 8s on the Button against a player who is down to just 8 chips (2 BB), this is a clear raise situation. The opponent is likely to call with a very wide range given their desperation stack size. I want to get value and potentially eliminate them.\n\nThe minimum raise is to 8 chips, but given the opponent only has 8 chips total, I should just raise to put them all-in. This would be a raise to 10 (2 to call + 8 more = total of 10), but since they only have 8 chips, I can just raise to 8 and they'll be all-in for their remaining 6 chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: The pot is 6 (2+4), I posted the SB of 2. To call I need to put in 2 more. If I raise to 8 total, that means I'm putting in 6 more than the call amount. The opponent has 8 chips total and has put in 4 as BB, so they have 4 left. So if I raise to 8, they would need to call 4 more to match (they already put in 4 as BB, so 8 total means 4 more).\n\nSince they only have 8 chips total and 4 are already in the pot, they have 4 left. So raising to 8 puts them all-in.\n\nWith pocket 8s, I'm happy to get it in against a random hand from a desperate short stack. This is a +EV play that also has tournament equity benefits by potentially eliminating an opponent.\n\nI'll raise to put pressure and get value. Since the minimum raise is 8 and that puts them all-in, that's the right amount.",

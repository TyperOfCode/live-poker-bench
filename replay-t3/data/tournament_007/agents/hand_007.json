            "reasoning_content": "  The user is playing No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker in a tournament. I need to analyze the current situation and provide a decision.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Position: CO (Cutoff) - Seat 1\n- Hand: 9c Qc (Queen-Nine suited, clubs)\n- Stack: 225 chips (112.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 11 chips\n- Action: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8\n- Amount to call: 8\n- Minimum raise to: 14\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nLet me analyze this:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Q9s is a marginal hand. It's suited which gives some flush potential, but it's not a premium hand. It plays better in position, and I'm in CO (good position).\n\n2. **Position**: CO is good position - I act after most players but still have the BTN to act after me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: I just searched for GPT-OSS-120B's actions. Let me review:\n   - Hand 2: preflop fold\n   - Hand 3: preflop check (must have been BB), flop call 2, turn fold\n   - Hand 4: preflop call 1 (likely BB), flop check, turn check, turn fold\n   - Hand 5: preflop fold\n   - Hand 6: preflop fold\n   \n   So GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively tight/passive. They haven't shown any aggressive preflop raises until now. This is their first preflop raise in the hands I can see. This suggests they likely have a strong hand.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 11. That's 8/19 = 42% pot odds. Q9s typically has around 45-50% equity against a random hand, but against a tight player's raising range, it's much worse - probably around 30-35% equity.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (112.5 BB). I don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving my stack and looking for better opportunities is wise.\n\n6. **Action analysis**: The raise comes from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) who is in the Hijack position (one seat before me). Given their tight profile, this raise likely indicates a strong hand (premium pairs, strong broadway hands, maybe some suited connectors).\n\nWith Q9s, I'm dominated by many hands in their range (AQ, KQ, QJ, etc.). The suitedness helps but not enough to justify a call against a tight player's first preflop raise.\n\nI should fold. The hand is too weak, the opponent is showing strength with their first preflop raise, and I can preserve my chips for a better spot.\n\nDecision: fold",

The opponent in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8 from what appears to be UTG (since seats 1 and 2 folded). I'm on the button, so I have position.\n\nLooking at the opponent history: GPT-OSS-120B has folded 5 times, called twice, checked once. No raises observed. This is their first raise in 6 hands. That suggests they might have a decent hand.\n\nThe pot is 11 chips (SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 8). I need to call 7 chips to win 11, giving me pot odds of about 1.57:1 (11:7). That's about 39% equity needed.\n\nWith 2d 3d, my hand is very weak preflop. Even as a suited connector, it needs to hit a strong draw or made hand to continue. The implied odds could be decent if I hit a flush or straight draw, but I'm out of position relative to the raiser (they acted before me).\n\nHowever, I have position on the BB (MiniMax-M2) who hasn't acted yet. The BB has 189 chips and could call or raise.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history: They've shown some aggression - raised once, called raises, and bet on flops. They seem to be playing somewhat actively.\n\nGiven my weak hand, the fact that this is GPT-OSS-120B's first raise (suggesting strength), and the pot odds aren't great for such a weak hand, folding seems correct. The suited connector potential isn't enough to justify calling 7 chips (3.5 BB) with 2-3 suited.\n\nAlso, tournament considerations: I have 194 chips (97 BB), so I'm not short-stacked. No need to gamble with such a weak hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot."

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm on the BTN with 2d 3d. This is a suited connector, but it's a very weak hand - the lowest possible suited connector. The opponent in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8 from what appears to be UTG (since seats 1 and 2 folded). I'm on the button, so I have position.\n\nLooking at the opponent history: GPT-OSS-120B has folded 5 times, called twice, checked once. No raises observed. This is their first raise in 6 hands. That suggests they might have a decent hand.\n\nThe pot is 11 chips (SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 8). I need to call 7 chips to win 11, giving me pot odds of about 1.57:1 (11:7). That's about 39% equity needed.\n\nWith 2d 3d, my hand is very weak preflop. Even as a suited connector, it needs to hit a strong draw or made hand to continue. The implied odds could be decent if I hit a flush or straight draw, but I'm out of position relative to the raiser (they acted before me).\n\nHowever, I have position on the BB (MiniMax-M2) who hasn't acted yet. The BB has 189 chips and could call or raise.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history: They've shown some aggression - raised once, called raises, and bet on flops. They seem to be playing somewhat actively.\n\nGiven my weak hand, the fact that this is GPT-OSS-120B's first raise (suggesting strength), and the pot odds aren't great for such a weak hand, folding seems correct. The suited connector potential isn't enough to justify calling 7 chips (3.5 BB) with 2-3 suited.\n\nAlso, tournament considerations: I have 194 chips (97 BB), so I'm not short-stacked. No need to gamble with such a weak hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

I need to call 6 more chips to continue.\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent history, they've been quite passive - folding a lot preflop, checking/calling when they do play, and folding on later streets. This suggests they might be playing tight/passive.\n\n4. **Hand strength**: 6d 8s is a weak hand. While it's a suited connector with some potential to make straights and flushes, it's generally not strong enough to call a raise, especially from out of position (though I'm actually in position as the button).\n\n5. **Position considerations**: I'm on the button, which is the best position. However, 6d 8s is still quite weak for calling a raise. Even with position advantage, this hand has poor equity against a raising range.\n\n6. **Stack considerations**: With 94.5 BB, I have a healthy stack and don't need to take risky spots to stay alive in the tournament.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I'm getting about 2.67:1 pot odds (11 chips already in pot, 6 to call), but 6d 8s doesn't have enough equity against a reasonable raising range to justify calling.\n\n8. **Tournament strategy**: In tournaments, preserving stack is important, especially with a decent stack size.

Position provides minimal advantage with such a low-equity hand.\n\nI'll maintain a disciplined approach, recognizing this isn't a strategic spot to invest chips, especially given the tournament's early stages and my solid stack position.",

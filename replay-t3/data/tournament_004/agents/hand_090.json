            "content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm on the button with Kc 2h. My stack is 144 chips (4.5 BB). Blinds are 16/32. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 16, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted BB 32. Both players are still to act after me.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2, 482 chips): Very aggressive preflop, raises frequently (125, 266, 96, 282, 330 in recent hands). Shows a wide range including hands like 8s6s, Jh6s, KcQh.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2, 113 chips): Mostly folds preflop, but has raised once to 64 and called once. Shows some decent hands when they do play (ThAc, QhQs, QdAc).\n\nMy hand K2o is weak, especially offsuit. However, I have position (BTN) and a very short stack (4.5 BB). In tournament poker with such a short stack, I need to consider shoving or folding.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 48 chips, I need to call 32 chips. That's 32 to win 80 (48+32), or 2.5:1 odds (40% equity needed).\n\nMy stack size is critical. With only 4.5 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Looking at my recent history, I've been folding a lot, but won a decent pot in hand 85 with K3s when I called and hit trips.\n\nGiven my position on the button and the fact that both opponents have shown they can fold (especially Seat 4 who folds most hands), I should consider shoving. A shove would be 144 total (112 more than the call). This puts pressure on the blinds.\n\nHowever, K2o is a very weak hand. Even against random hands, it has only ~40% equity. Against the BB's likely calling range (which is probably tighter than random given he's deep and aggressive), my equity might be worse.\n\nAlternative is to fold and wait for a better spot. But with only 4.5 BB, I'm getting desperate. The next hand I'll be in the small blind (16 chips) then big blind (32 chips), which will leave me with even less.\n\nLet me think about stack preservation vs accumulation. If I fold, I have 144 chips (4.5 BB). Next hand I post SB of 16, leaving 128 (4 BB). Then BB of 32, leaving 96 (3 BB). So I have maybe 2-3 hands before I'm forced all-in anyway.\n\nIf I shove here and get called, I need ~40% equity to be profitable. K2o vs a typical calling range from BB (maybe 22+, A2s+, A2o+, K9s+, KTo+, QTs+, JTs) has about 35% equity. Not great.\n\nBut if I can get folds from both blinds, I win 48 chips uncontested, increasing my stack to 192 (6 BB). That's a significant improvement.\n\nGiven Seat 4 (SB) has 113 chips (3.5 BB) and folds a lot, and Seat 2 (BB) is aggressive but might not want to call off with marginal hands against a short stack shove, there's fold equity.\n\nI think the best play is to go all-in. The alternative is to call and see a flop, but with only 112 chips behind, I'll be pot-committed anyway on any flop. Better to shove now and maximize fold equity.\n\nLet me check if there's any specific pattern of BB calling short stack shoves."

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm on the button with Kc 2h. My stack is 144 chips (4.5 BB). Blinds are 16/32. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 16, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted BB 32. Both players are still to act after me.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2, 482 chips): Very aggressive preflop, raises frequently (125, 266, 96, 282, 330 in recent hands). Shows a wide range including hands like 8s6s, Jh6s, KcQh.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2, 113 chips): Mostly folds preflop, but has raised once to 64 and called once. Shows some decent hands when they do play (ThAc, QhQs, QdAc).\n\nMy hand K2o is weak, especially offsuit. However, I have position (BTN) and a very short stack (4.5 BB). In tournament poker with such a short stack, I need to consider shoving or folding.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 48 chips, I need to call 32 chips. That's 32 to win 80 (48+32), or 2.5:1 odds (40% equity needed).\n\nMy stack size is critical. With only 4.5 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Looking at my recent history, I've been folding a lot, but won a decent pot in hand 85 with K3s when I called and hit trips.\n\nGiven my position on the button and the fact that both opponents have shown they can fold (especially Seat 4 who folds most hands), I should consider shoving. A shove would be 144 total (112 more than the call). This puts pressure on the blinds.\n\nHowever, K2o is a very weak hand. Even against random hands, it has only ~40% equity. Against the BB's likely calling range (which is probably tighter than random given he's deep and aggressive), my equity might be worse.\n\nAlternative is to fold and wait for a better spot. But with only 4.5 BB, I'm getting desperate. The next hand I'll be in the small blind (16 chips) then big blind (32 chips), which will leave me with even less.\n\nLet me think about stack preservation vs accumulation. If I fold, I have 144 chips (4.5 BB). Next hand I post SB of 16, leaving 128 (4 BB). Then BB of 32, leaving 96 (3 BB). So I have maybe 2-3 hands before I'm forced all-in anyway.\n\nIf I shove here and get called, I need ~40% equity to be profitable. K2o vs a typical calling range from BB (maybe 22+, A2s+, A2o+, K9s+, KTo+, QTs+, JTs) has about 35% equity. Not great.\n\nBut if I can get folds from both blinds, I win 48 chips uncontested, increasing my stack to 192 (6 BB). That's a significant improvement.\n\nGiven Seat 4 (SB) has 113 chips (3.5 BB) and folds a lot, and Seat 2 (BB) is aggressive but might not want to call off with marginal hands against a short stack shove, there's fold equity.\n\nI think the best play is to go all-in. The alternative is to call and see a flop, but with only 112 chips behind, I'll be pot-committed anyway on any flop. Better to shove now and maximize fold equity.\n\nLet me check if there's any specific pattern of BB calling short stack shoves.",

Let me analyze the situation again and make a decision.\n\nI'm on the button with Kc 2h, stack of 144 chips (4.5 BB). Blinds are 16/32, pot is 48 chips. I need to call 32 chips. Minimum raise to is 64 (double the bet), but I can go all-in for 144 total.\n\nMy hand is weak - K2o. But I have position and a very short stack. With only 4.5 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. The next two hands I'll be in blinds, which will cost me 48 chips total, leaving me with 96 chips (3 BB).\n\nIf I shove here, I'm risking 144 to win 48 chips if both fold. That's 3:1 on my risk if they fold. If they call, I need about 40% equity. K2o has about 35% against a typical calling range from BB.\n\nBut there's fold equity. The SB (Seat 4) has 113 chips and folds a lot. The BB (Seat 2) is aggressive but might not call with marginal hands against a short stack shove.\n\nGiven my desperate stack situation, I should shove. Waiting for a better spot is risky because I'll be forced all-in soon anyway with even worse odds. Better to shove now with some fold equity.\n\nIf I call 32, I'll have 112 behind and be pot-committed on any flop anyway. So shoving preflop is better.\n\nLet me structure the response.

            "content": "Looking at this situation, I need to analyze several key factors:\n\n**Hand Analysis**: King-Ten offsuit is a decent hand but not premium enough to commit my entire stack from the Small Blind position.\n\n**Stack Situation**: I have only 113 chips (3.5 BB), which makes this a critical decision. To call the 128 chips would leave me with essentially no chips behind, committing my entire tournament life.\n\n**Opponent Intelligence**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's recent history, they've been quite active with raises (144, 136, 112 chips recently) but also folding frequently. This suggests they might be playing aggressively or could be on tilt.\n\n**Position Disadvantage**: Being in the Small Blind is the worst position to defend from, especially with a short stack. I'd be playing out of position for the entire hand.\n\n**Pot Odds**: The pot is offering about 1.5:1 odds, which isn't favorable enough for a marginal hand like KTo.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: At 3.5 BB, I need to be selective about committing my stack. King-Ten offsuit doesn't have enough equity to justify going all-in preflop, especially when there are better spots to potentially double up.\n\nThe math doesn't work out in my favor here. I need to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"King-Ten offsuit is not strong enough to commit my entire 113-chip stack from the Small Blind position, especially when facing a raise from an active opponent.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n1. **My Hand**: King-Ten offsuit (Td Kh) - This is a decent hand but not premium. It has good potential for straights and flushes, and the King gives it decent high card value.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the Small Blind (Seat 4) - This is a terrible position to be defending from, especially with a short stack of only 113 chips (3.5 BB).\n\n3. **The Raise**: DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 144 chips preflop. Looking at their history, I can see they've been quite active with raises recently (hands 77, 78) but have also folded a lot. This suggests they might be playing somewhat aggressively or could be on tilt.\n\n4. **Stack Situation**: I have 113 chips total. To call, I need to put in 128 more chips, which would leave me with essentially zero chips behind. This would be committing my entire stack.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: The current pot is 192 chips, and I need to call 128 to see the flop. That's giving me pot odds of about 1.5:1, which isn't great for a hand that's not premium.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: I'm at 3.5 BB, which is very short-stacked. I should be looking for spots to either double up or find a better spot. King-Ten offsuit is probably not strong enough to commit my entire stack with, especially from the small blind.\n\n7. **Opponent Analysis**: DeepSeek-V3.2 has been raising and folding frequently. They're not showing a pattern of just stealing blinds, as they've raised to substantial amounts (112, 136) recently.\n\n8. **My Recent History**: I can see I've been folding a lot and my last hand was a QQ that I won without showdown. I'm not in a great spot to make loose calls.\n\nGiven all these factors:\n\n\nI'll opt for a strategic fold. The hand lacks the strength to justify committing my entire short stack, especially from the Small Blind. With limited chips and facing a raise, preserving my tournament life is crucial. The marginal nature of King-Ten offsuit means I'm better off waiting for a more powerful hand that offers a clearer path to survival and potential chip accumulation.",

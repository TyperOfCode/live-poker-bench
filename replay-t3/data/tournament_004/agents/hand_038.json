I get to act last on every street.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 113 chips (28.2 BB). This is a healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has folded 9 out of 10 recent preflop hands. Only called once in hand #29. Seems very tight/foldy.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has shown some calling tendencies, but also folds frequently. Showdown hand #3 shows KQo.\n\n5. **Current action**: Everyone folded to me on the button. Only blinds are in the pot (SB and BB). The BB (seat 5) already posted 4, so I need to call 4 to see a flop.\n\n6. **Options**:\n   - Fold: Too tight given position and stack. We have a decent hand on the button.\n   - Call: Get to see flop cheaply with position. Pot odds: 4 to win 6 (1.5:1).\n   - Raise: Standard button play to steal blinds. Minimum raise to 8 (4 more chips).\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 28BB, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive, especially from the button. The blinds are likely to fold often based on their tendencies.\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 (SB) has been folding almost constantly preflop, and GPT-OSS-120B (BB) has been folding frequently too, a raise could win the pot immediately. Even if called, I have position.\n\nA standard raise size would be 2.5-3x BB, so 10-12 chips total. Minimum raise is 8, but that's small. I should raise to 12 (3x BB).\n\nWait, I should check my recent hand #33 where I had JJ on BTN and raised to 32 (8x BB) which was too big. Let me be more reasonable.\n\nActually, with QTo, I think a standard 3x raise to 12 is good. If either blind calls, I have position.\n\nLet's calculate: If I raise to 12, I risk 12 to win 6 (2:1 immediate odds). If SB folds 90% and BB folds say 70%, then the raise has high success probability.\n\nDecision: Raise to 12 chips."

In BB vs a raise from MP? Seat3 likely is MP (position after SB, BB). So they are in early position (maybe UTG?). Actually seat numbers: seat1 is UTG? Not sure. But seat3 is after seat2 (who folded). Could be UTG+1. So they raise from early position, indicating a tighter range. Jc9 offsuit is weak.

Pocket 9s is a strong hand heads-up against a single BB.\n\nWith only 8 chips to call (half a BB), I'm getting excellent pot odds. The pot is 24, I need to call 8, giving me 3:1 pot odds.\n\nConsidering my stack size (13.2 BB), I need to accumulate chips. Pocket 9s is a strong hand to play heads-up from the button.\n\nOptions:\n1. Call: Complete to 16, see a flop. This is conservative but allows me to see a flop cheaply.\n2. Raise: Standard raise would be 2.5-3x BB, so 40-48 chips. Minimum raise is to 32 (2x BB). \n\nGiven opponent's aggression, if I just call, they might raise. But I'm on the button, so they act after me postflop.\n\nI should raise to build the pot with my strong hand and take initiative. A raise to 48 (3x BB) would be good. That's 40 more chips (8 already in).\n\nMy stack after raising to 48: 164 left. That's still 10.25 BB, so manageable.\n\nIf opponent re-raises, I need to consider. With pocket 9s and 13 BB effective stacks, I'm probably committed. But opponent has only 174 chips (10.9 BB), so a re-raise would likely be all-in.\n\nLooking at opponent's showdowns: they had QQ, AQ, A10, 62s. They're raising with a range that includes strong hands but also some speculative ones.\n\nI think raising is best. Let's go with a standard 3x raise."

Pocket 9s is a strong hand heads-up against a single BB.\n\nWith only 8 chips to call (half a BB), I'm getting excellent pot odds. The pot is 24, I need to call 8, giving me 3:1 pot odds.\n\nConsidering my stack size (13.2 BB), I need to accumulate chips. Pocket 9s is a strong hand to play heads-up from the button.\n\nOptions:\n1. Call: Complete to 16, see a flop. This is conservative but allows me to see a flop cheaply.\n2. Raise: Standard raise would be 2.5-3x BB, so 40-48 chips. Minimum raise is to 32 (2x BB). \n\nGiven opponent's aggression, if I just call, they might raise. But I'm on the button, so they act after me postflop.\n\nI should raise to build the pot with my strong hand and take initiative. A raise to 48 (3x BB) would be good. That's 40 more chips (8 already in).\n\nMy stack after raising to 48: 164 left. That's still 10.25 BB, so manageable.\n\nIf opponent re-raises, I need to consider. With pocket 9s and 13 BB effective stacks, I'm probably committed. But opponent has only 174 chips (10.9 BB), so a re-raise would likely be all-in.\n\nLooking at opponent's showdowns: they had QQ, AQ, A10, 62s. They're raising with a range that includes strong hands but also some speculative ones.\n\nI think raising is best. Let's go with a standard 3x raise.",

This is a very wet board with:\n1. Flush draw (three hearts)\n2. Straight draws (4-7, 2-5, 4-7)\n3. My hand: middle pair (nines) with no heart\n\n**Opponent tendencies from research:**\n- MiniMax-M2 has shown aggression on flops (bet 200 on hand 68 with top pair)\n- They tend to check sometimes on flop (hands 61, 65)\n- They have 3-bet preflop with strong hands (KK in hand 63)\n- They called my preflop raise, so likely has a decent hand\n\n**My hand strength:** Middle pair is vulnerable on this board. The flush draw is concerning. However:\n- I have position advantage\n- My pair might still be best if opponent missed\n- I could improve to a set on turn/river\n\n**Tournament considerations:** My stack is 10.8 BB, which is getting short. I need to accumulate chips soon.\n\n**Decision options:**\n1. **Check:** See a free card, but gives opponent chance to bet turn\n2. **Bet:** Take initiative, could win pot now if opponent missed\n\nGiven the board texture and opponent tendencies, I think a small continuation bet is appropriate. If opponent has a heart draw, they might call or raise. If they missed completely, they'll likely fold.\n\nThe pot is 96, and my stack is 172. A bet of around 48-64 (half to 2/3 pot) seems reasonable. This sets up a potential all-in on turn if called.\n\nLet me check the minimum raise: 32. So I can bet as little as 32.\n\nGiven my short stack and the need to accumulate, I'll make a moderate bet. If raised, I can consider folding unless I think it's a bluff.\n\n**Final decision:** Bet 64 (2/3 pot) to apply pressure and potentially win the pot now.",

Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has 78 chips left, we have 108 chips. Pot is 224 chips.\n\nPreflop: We raised to 48 from BTN, opponent called from BB.\nFlop: We bet 64 (2/3 pot), opponent called.\nTurn: Paired board with 5s (board now 5h 3h 6h 5s).\n\nWe have 108 chips total, we've already put in 8+48+64 = 120 chips? Wait, that doesn't add up. Let me recalculate:\n- Started with 108 chips\n- Post SB: 8 (left with 100)\n- Raise preflop: 48 (left with 52)\n- Bet flop: 64 (would leave -12, so we must be all-in?)\n\nActually, looking at the numbers: Our stack is 108 chips. We posted SB 8, raised 48 more (total 56), then bet 64 on flop. That's 120 chips total, but we only have 108. Something's off. Maybe the stack displayed is after posting? Or maybe the bets are cumulative? Let me think differently.\n\nActually, the \"Your Stack: 108 chips\" is our current stack. We have 108 chips left. The pot is 224 chips. We need to figure out how much we've already invested.\n\nFrom actions: preflop we raised to 48 total (including SB). So we put in 40 more after posting SB 8. Then on flop we bet 64. So total invested: 8 + 40 + 64 = 112 chips. But we have 108 left, so starting stack would be 220. That seems high for tournament with 8/16 blinds.\n\nWait, maybe the \"Your Stack: 108 chips\" is what we have at this moment. We've already invested: SB 8 + raise 40 + bet 64 = 112. So starting stack was 220? That seems inconsistent with tournament structure.\n\nActually, looking at opponent's stack: 78 chips. They posted BB 16, called our raise (32 more), called flop bet 64. That's 16+32+64=112 chips. But they have 78 left, so starting stack was 190. That makes more sense.\n\nAnyway, the key point: We have 108 chips left, opponent has 78 left. Pot is 224. We're first to act on turn.\n\nOur hand: 9h9c on board 5h 3h 6h 5s. We have middle pair. The board is scary: three hearts (flush possible), paired 5s (full house possible), straight draws (4-7, 2-5, 4-5). Our 9s are not hearts.\n\nOpponent's tendencies from recall: They've been folding a lot preflop, but have shown some aggression recently:\n- Hand 61: Called preflop, checked flop, bet turn small (32)\n- Hand 62: Raised preflop to 64\n- Hand 63: Raised preflop to 228 (big raise)\n- Hand 65: Checked through, bet river small (32)\n- Hand 68: Raised preflop to 64, bet flop 200 (big bet)\n\nSo opponent can be aggressive. They called our preflop raise and flop bet. What could they have? They could have:\n1. A flush draw (AhXh, KhXh, QhXh, JhXh, ThXh, 8h7h, 7h4h, etc.)\n2. A 5 (A5, 65, 75, 85, 95, T5, J5, Q5, K5) for trips\n3. A pocket pair (44, 77, 88, TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA)\n4. A straight draw (74, 47, 42, 24)\n5. A bluff\n\nThe turn paired the board, which is bad for us if opponent has a 5 (now full house) or if they were slow-playing a bigger hand.\n\nWe have position (BTN) and act first on turn. Options: check or bet. We could check to see what opponent does with their 78 chips. If we bet, we'd likely be committing since we only have 108 left.\n\nPot odds: If we bet and get called, we're likely all-in by river. We need to consider if our hand is good enough to value bet.\n\n"

The turn paired the 5s, which could give someone with a 5 a full house. There are flush draws, straight draws, and possible trips.\n\nGiven we're first to act and have position, checking seems reasonable to control pot size and see what opponent does. If we bet, we're committing most of our stack since we only have 108 left and pot is 224. A bet would likely be all-in or close to it.\n\nOpponent has only 78 chips left, so if we bet and they call, they're basically all-in too. But if they shove over our bet, we'd have to call given pot odds.\n\nActually, let me think about bet sizing. Minimum raise is 64, but we could bet smaller? Wait, \"minimum raise to: 64\" means if we raise, we need to raise to at least 64 total? Actually \"minimum raise to: 64\" likely means the minimum raise amount is 64 chips (double the previous bet?). But amount to call is 0, so we can check or bet any amount from 64 up to our stack?\n\nActually, \"Amount to call: 0\" means no bet to us. \"Minimum raise to: 64\" means if we want to bet/raise, the minimum total bet is 64 chips. So we can check (free) or bet at least 64 chips.\n\nGiven our stack of 108, betting 64 would leave us with 44 chips behind. That's basically committing us. If opponent calls, pot would be 224 + 64 + 64 = 352 chips, and we'd have 44 behind for river.\n\nBut is our hand strong enough to value bet? Middle pair on this board is vulnerable. Many hands beat us: any heart flush, any 5 (trips/full house), any overpair, any set (66, 33). We're only beating bluffs and lower pairs.\n\nChecking seems safer. We can see what opponent does. If they bet small with their 78 chips, we might have to call given pot odds. But at least we get more information.\n\nI should check opponent's tendencies more. Let me use recall tools.",

Given the scary board and our vulnerable middle pair, checking seems prudent. We can:\n1. Check to control pot size\n2. See what opponent does with their remaining 78 chips\n3. Evaluate river action\n\nIf we check and opponent bets, we'll have to decide whether to call. They only have 78 chips left, so any bet will be significant relative to pot. But checking gives us more information.\n\nGiven our position (BTN) and that we're first to act, checking seems reasonable.

The board shows:\n- Possible flush: Three hearts on board\n- Possible straight: 3-4-5-6-7 would be a straight, but I have 9s\n- Possible full house: Someone could have a 5 or Q for a full house\n- Possible trips: Someone could have a 5\n\nThe queen on the river is concerning because it's an overcard to my nines. However, I was the aggressor preflop and on the flop. My opponent called both times and checked the turn.\n\nLet me think about what hands my opponent could have:\n- They called from the BB, so their range is wide\n- They called a flop bet on a 5h 3h 6h board - this suggests they have something: maybe a flush draw, a straight draw, a pair, or a slow-played strong hand\n- They checked the turn when the 5s paired the board - this could be cautious with a flush draw, or checking back with a medium hand\n\nOn the river, the Qs is a scare card. It completes some draws (though not many obvious ones) and puts an overcard on board.\n\nI should check here. My hand is medium strength - a pair of nines. I was betting for value on the flop, but the river Q is bad for my hand. If I bet, I only get called by better hands (any queen, any flush, any full house). Worse hands will fold. If I check, I might induce a bluff from missed draws, or win at showdown if my opponent has nothing.\n\nMy stack is 108, opponent has 78. The pot is 224. If I bet, I'd likely bet around half pot (112) but that's more than my stack. Actually I only have 108 left, so any bet would be all-in.\n\nChecking seems better.

My opponent is MiniMax-M2 in the BB with only 14 chips left (they have 14 chips total? Wait, they bet 64 on river but only have 14 chips? That seems inconsistent. Let me check the details.)\n\nOpponent is seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 14 chips. But they bet 64 on river? That can't be right if they only have 14 chips. Maybe the 14 chips is their remaining stack after the bet? Or maybe it's a display issue. Let me reconstruct.\n\nPreflop: I posted SB 8, they posted BB 16. I raised to 48 total (so additional 40). They called 32 more (48-16=32). So preflop pot: my 48 + their 48 = 96? Actually I put in 48, they put in 48 (16 BB + 32 call). So pot 96.\n\nFlop: I bet 64, they called 64. So pot now 96+64+64=224. Turn: both check. River: I check, they bet 64. Amount to call: 64.\n\nBut they only have 14 chips according to the player list. That must be their remaining stack after the bet? If they bet 64, they'd be all-in if they only had 14. Wait, maybe the 14 chips is a mistake. Let me think: They started with 14 chips? That seems very low. But they called 64 on flop, so they must have had at least 64 chips. So the player list showing 14 chips is probably their current stack after the river bet? Actually, if they bet 64 on river and have 14 left, that means they had 78 chips before river. But they called 64 on flop, so they had at least 64. Possibly they started with around 78.\n\nAnyway, I have 108 chips total. I've already invested 48+64=112? Wait, I started with 108. I posted SB 8, raised to 48 total (so added 40). Then bet 64 on flop. That's 8+40+64=112. But I only have 108 total. That doesn't add up. Something is off with the chip counts.\n\nLet me recalc: My stack is 108 chips. Preflop: I post SB 8, raise to 48 total (so added 40). That's 48 invested. Flop: I bet 64. That would be 48+64=112, which exceeds my stack of 108. So maybe the bet sizes are different. Perhaps the \"raise to 48\" means total including SB? That would be 48 total, which includes my 8 SB, so additional 40. That's 48 invested preflop. Then flop bet 64 would put me at 112, but I only have 108, so I can't bet 64. Unless I have more chips. Hmm.\n\nMaybe the stack size is current after previous actions? Let me read carefully: \"Your Stack: 108 chips (6.8 BB)\". That's my current stack at the river before acting. So I have 108 chips left to play with. The amount to call is 64. If I call, I'd have 44 left.\n\nBut I need to understand the opponent's range. They are MiniMax-M2 with a very short stack (14 chips). They called preflop from BB, called flop bet, checked turn, and now bet river after I checked. The board is 5h3h6h5sQs. There's a flush possible (hearts). I have 99 with no heart. The board has three hearts, plus a pair of fives. My hand is basically a bluff catcher: I beat bluffs but lose to any heart flush, any five, any queen, any six, any three, any pair higher than 9. Actually, board has 5-3-6-5-Q. My 99 beats any hand that doesn't have a pair or better. So only bluffs or maybe a smaller pocket pair like 88,77,44,22 etc. But those might not call preflop and flop.\n\nOpponent is very short-stacked. They might be shoving with any decent hand. They could have a flush, a five, a queen, maybe a straight (4h7h?). The straight would be 4-7, but board is 5-3-6-5-Q, so 4-7 makes a straight, but that's unlikely. They could have a heart flush.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this situation. I have 99 on a board with three hearts and a pair of fives. My hand is marginal - it's essentially a bluff catcher. The pot is 288, and I need to call 64. That's pot odds of 288:64, or 4.5:1, meaning I need about 18% equity to call.\n\nThe opponent is very short-stacked (14 chips). They bet 64 on the river after I checked. Given their short stack, they might be shoving with a wide range, including missed draws or weaker hands. However, they called preflop and flop, so they have some piece.\n\nLooking at their past actions: they raised preflop in hand 63 to 228 (big raise), and in hand 68 raised to 64 preflop and bet 200 on flop. Seems aggressive. In hand 65, they checked all streets then bet 32 on river. So they do bet rivers sometimes.\n\nThe board has a flush draw that got there. They could have a flush, a five, a queen, or a bluff. My 99 beats bluffs and maybe smaller pairs. But would they call preflop and flop with a small pair? Possibly.\n\nGiven the pot odds (4.5:1), I only need to be good about 18% of the time. Against a short-stacked opponent who might be desperate, I think calling is reasonable. Folding leaves me with 108 chips (6.8 BB), which is still playable but short. Calling and winning would give me 288+64=352 pot? Actually, if I call 64, pot becomes 288+64=352, and I'd have 44 left. If I lose, I'd have 44 left (2.75 BB), which is critical.\n\nBut wait, the opponent only has 14 chips. If they bet 64, they're essentially all-in (since they have 14 left). So they're putting their last chips in. That suggests they have something. However, desperate short stacks might shove with any pair.\n\nI should also consider my image: I raised preflop, bet flop, checked turn and river. That looks like I might have given up. My check on river could induce a bluff.\n\nGiven the pot odds and the fact that short stacks can bluff here, I think I should call. It's a close decision, but the pot odds justify it.",

The 48-chip raise seems relatively small compared to their typical sizing, suggesting this might be a steal attempt or they have a weaker hand.\n\nMy hand Ah-7h is playable from the Big Blind. The pot odds are excellent - I need to call 32 chips to win 64, giving me 2:1 odds. With Ace-high suited, I have decent equity with potential for top pair, flush draws, and straight draws.\n\nMy stack size of 174 chips (10.9 BB) means I should be cautious about committing too much preflop. Calling keeps me in a good position to evaluate the flop while preserving my tournament life. A re-raise would commit a significant portion of my stack and put me in a difficult spot if they have a strong hand.\n\nMy history from the Big Blind shows a reasonable 19.1% win rate, indicating I can play well from this position. The combination of good pot odds, playable hand strength, and stack considerations makes calling the optimal play here.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Getting excellent 2:1 pot odds with Ah-7h. Opponent's smaller raise size suggests possible steal. Calling preserves my 10.9 BB stack while keeping the hand playable post-flop.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Looking at my own hand history from the Big Blind position, I can see I have a 19.1% win rate when playing from BB, which is quite reasonable. I have some notable hands including:\n\n1. Ac-Ad that I won against a 40-chip raise\n2. Ts-Jh that I called with and won 136 chips\n3. 5c-Jd where I checked through and won 80 chips on river\n\nThis suggests I'm capable of playing well from the BB position and have had success with both calling and betting strategies.\n\nNow for the current hand: I have Ah-7h facing a 48-chip raise. The pot odds are excellent - I need to call 32 to win 64, giving me 2:1 odds. With Ace-high suited, I have decent equity and potential to make strong hands.\n\nLooking at DeepSeek-V3.2's patterns, they've been raising frequently but also folding a lot. Their raise sizes have varied (24, 114, 122, 212), and the current 48-chip raise seems on the smaller side, possibly indicating a steal attempt or weaker holdings.\n\nGiven my stack size of 174 chips (10.9 BB), calling keeps me in a good position to play post-flop while preserving my tournament life. A re-raise would commit too much of my stack and put me at risk if they have a premium hand.\n\nThe decision is clear: call the 32 chips and see the flop.",

The minimum raise to 128 would commit almost my entire stack, which is too aggressive with just a draw.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear call based on pot odds and drawing potential.

This suggests they might be a somewhat aggressive player who can be bluffed.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 160, bet is 64, so I need to call 64 to win 224 total\n- That's about 28.6% pot odds\n- With a flush draw, I have roughly 9 outs (13 hearts - 4 showing = 9 hearts) = 36% equity to make a flush by river\n- Plus I have Ace-high which could be good even without flush\n- This is a clear call based on pot odds alone\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm at 8.9 BB, so I need to be selective about hands\n- But this is a premium drawing hand with good equity\n- If I make the flush, I'll likely win a significant pot\n- If I miss, I can fold to further aggression\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear call. I have excellent pot odds, a strong drawing hand with good equity, and I'm getting a price that's way better than my flush draw equity. Even if I miss the flush, my Ace-high might be good depending on the board.\n\nThe minimum raise would be to 128, which would put in almost my entire stack. That's too aggressive with just a draw. \n\nI'll make the call, keeping my options open for the next betting round.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n1. **My Position**: BB (Seat 4) with 78 chips (4.9 BB)\n2. **My Cards**: 7h Ah - this is Ace-high with a weak kicker and a flush draw\n3. **Board**: 5h 3h 6h 5s - there's a flush draw on the hearts, and the board is paired (5s)\n4. **Current Situation**: \n   - Pot: 224 chips\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) just checked on the turn\n   - Amount to call: 0 (so I can check or raise)\n   - Minimum raise to: 64\n\nLet me analyze the opponent's tendencies from the recall:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 has been quite active preflop with several raises (hands 58, 63, 66)\n- In the current hand (#65), they checked all the way through on flop, turn, and river, then folded\n- They seem to be a somewhat aggressive player who likes to raise preflop\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have Ace-high with a flush draw (7h Ah)\n- The board is 5h 3h 6h 5s - there's a flush draw and a paired board\n- If I hit my flush, I could have the nuts (if no higher hearts are out there)\n- I have 78 chips total, so this is a significant portion of my stack\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Stack size**: I'm short-stacked with only 4.9 BB, so I need to be careful\n2. **Hand strength**: I have Ace-high and a flush draw, which has decent equity\n3. **Opponent tendency**: They seem to check a lot, suggesting they might be weak or drawing\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 224 chips and I can check for free\n\nGiven that:\n\n\nI can check and see the river for free, which is attractive with my flush draw. If I miss the flush, I still have Ace-high, which might win against a weaker hand. The opponent's checking pattern suggests they might be holding a marginal hand or drawing. With my short stack, a free card is valuable, and I have multiple ways to win - either by hitting the flush or potentially having the best Ace-high hand.\n",

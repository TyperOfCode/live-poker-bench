This is definitely a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. However, with Q5 offsuit, position doesn't help much.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n   - They've folded preflop in hands 1 and 4\n   - They called in hand 2 (8 chips) and folded on the flop\n   - In hand 3, they raised preflop (6 chips), then called flop (12), turn (40), and bet river (60)\n   - They showed down Jd Ad in hand 3, which is a strong starting hand\n   \n   This suggests they're playing fairly straightforward - folding weak hands, playing strong hands aggressively.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 219 chips (109.5 BB) - a healthy stack\n   - Opponent has 71 chips (35.5 BB) - relatively short stack\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 1 chip to win 3 chips (3:1 odds). This is attractive, but with Q5 offsuit, even these odds don't justify calling.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should be selective and preserve chips. Q5 offsuit is a clear fold.\n\nEven though I'm getting 3:1 pot odds on the button, Q5 offsuit is just too weak to play. The opponent in the BB seems to play reasonably solid poker based on their history. I should fold and wait for a better spot.",

The pot odds are 3:2 (need to call 2 to win 5), but implied odds aren't great with a weak hand that doesn't connect well.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (61.5 BB), no need to take unnecessary risks.

Kimi-K2 (Seat 2, BB): Raised preflop in hand #3, called bets, and bet river. More aggressive.\n3. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, next to act): Folded preflop twice, called once then folded postflop.\n4. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, big stack): Aggressive postflop betting in hand #3.\n\nK9o from UTG is a fold in most situations. The only reason to play would be if I think I can steal blinds, but I'm UTG with 4 players left to act (including both blinds), so that's unlikely. The pot odds are 3:2 (need to call 2 to win 5), but implied odds aren't great with a weak hand that doesn't connect well.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (61.5 BB), no need to take unnecessary risks. K9o plays poorly multi-way and I'm out of position against the rest of the table.\n\nI should fold. Let me check my own hand history to see if I've been playing too tight.",

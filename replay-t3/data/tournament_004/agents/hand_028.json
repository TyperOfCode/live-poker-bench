The flop is Td 3c 8d. BB checked to me.\n\nMy hand: Jc6c - I have a backdoor flush draw (clubs), a gutshot straight draw (9 would give me a straight, but with 7-9-J-Q needed, actually not a clean gutshot). I have overcards (J high). The board is Td 3c 8d - there's a possible flush draw (diamonds) on board.\n\nMy stack: 107 chips (26.8 BB) - I have 95 left after my preflop raise (107-12=95).\nPot: 26 chips (12 from me + 12 from BB + 2 SB)\nBB stack: 381 chips (much larger than mine)\n\nFrom the search results, I see GPT-OSS-120B has been fairly tight. In hand #18, they bet small on river after checks. In hand #26, they raised preflop. They folded to my raises in hands 23 and 24.\n\nMy position: Button - good position to take initiative.\n\nThe flop missed me completely except for backdoor draws. With BB checking, I could consider a continuation bet to try to take the pot down. However, my hand is weak and I have no real equity unless I hit a club flush or a miracle J.\n\nConsidering tournament stack preservation: I have 26.8 BB, which is decent but not huge. A failed c-bet would commit more chips.\n\nBetter to check back and see a turn card for free. If I hit a club on turn, I can reevaluate. If not, I can give up.\n\nThe pot is small (26 chips, about 6.5 BB). Not worth risking chips with such a weak hand.\n\nI should check.",

The board has T\u2666 3\u2663 8\u2666 6\u2665. There are flush draws (diamonds) and straight draws possible (7-9, 9-J). My hand is vulnerable - any overcard could beat me.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at opponent actions: GPT-OSS-120B has mostly folded preflop (8 of 10 actions), raised once, and bet once on river in hand 18. They seem relatively tight. They called my preflop raise and then checked both flop and turn. This could indicate:\n1. A medium-strength hand like a T, 8, or draw\n2. A weak hand they're giving up with\n3. A trap with a strong hand\n\n**Position & Stack:**\nI have position (on button) which is good. My stack is 107 vs opponent's 381. I'm relatively short-stacked (26.8 BB).\n\n**Pot Odds & Decision:**\nPot is 26, I can check for free or bet. If I bet, I could:\n1. Take it down now if opponent is weak\n2. Get value from worse hands (smaller pairs, draws)\n3. Build pot for river if I improve\n\nHowever, betting has risks:\n- If opponent raises, I'm in a tough spot with a marginal hand\n- If called, I may face a river bet\n- My hand is not strong enough for multiple streets of value\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** With 26.8 BB, I need to preserve chips but also accumulate. This is a marginal spot.\n\nGiven opponent's tight tendencies and double-check line, they likely have a weak to medium hand. A small bet could take it down. But checking keeps pot small and allows me to see a free river where I could improve to two pair or trips.\n\nActually, let me think about my preflop raise range. I raised J6s from BTN vs BB. This is a bit loose but okay in position. The opponent called from BB, so their range could be wide.\n\nI think the best play is to check back. Reasons:\n1. My hand has showdown value but isn't strong enough for value betting\n2. I can improve on river (any J, 6, or backdoor flush draw with club)\n3. Checking keeps pot small and controlled\n4. If opponent was trapping with a strong hand, I avoid getting raised\n5. If opponent bets river, I can reevaluate\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Middle pair with weak kicker on draw-heavy board.

Board is Td 3c 8d 6h 2s - no flush possible (two diamonds but not three). Straight possibilities: 9-7 or 7-5 for a straight, but board is dry.\n\nMy hand is marginal - bottom pair with decent kicker. However, I have position and the opponent has checked three streets. This suggests weakness.\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nGPT-OSS-120B has mostly folded preflop (8/10 actions). Only notable actions:\n- Hand #18: bet 2 on river\n- Hand #26: raised to 12 preflop\nThis suggests a tight-passive player who rarely bets.\n\n**My tournament situation:**\nI have 107 chips (26.8 BB) - medium stack. Opponent has 381 chips (95 BB) - big stack.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe opponent checked all three streets. Given their tight-passive tendencies, they likely have a weak hand or missed draw. The board is dry - no obvious draws that got there except maybe 9-7 or 7-5 for a straight.\n\nMy pair of 6s might be good here. Since opponent checked river, I have two options:\n1. Check - take a free showdown with marginal hand\n2. Bet small - try to get value from worse hands or get a fold\n\nGiven my stack size (107) and pot (26), a small bet of 8-12 chips (30-50% pot) could be reasonable. If opponent calls, I might still win with my pair. If they fold, I win the pot.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that if I bet and get raised, I'd have to fold. But given opponent's passive tendencies, they're unlikely to check-raise bluff on river.\n\nActually, let me think about hand ranges. I raised preflop from BTN, so my range is wide. Opponent called from BB, so their range is also wide but includes many hands that could have connected with this board: T-x, 8-x, maybe some pocket pairs, missed draws.\n\nMy hand beats: all bluffs, Ace-high, King-high, Queen-high, worse pairs (2s, 3s). Loses to: any T, 8, overpair, two pair, sets.\n\nGiven opponent checked all streets, they likely don't have a strong hand. A hand like T-x would probably bet for value at some point.\n\nI think a small value bet is good here. I'll bet 8 chips (about 30% pot). This is small enough that worse hands might call, but big enough to get folds from hands that beat me.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Bottom pair with J kicker on dry board.

            "reasoning_content": "We have hand: BB with Ah9h. Opponent in seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised to 12 (so open raise of 12, which is 3x big blind). BB facing 8 to call. Stack 389, deep. Hand Ah9 suited is decent but not premium. In early position? Opponent is in seat3 (UTG? Seats: seat1,2,3,4,5... we are seat5 BB, seat4 SB, seat3 is UTG? Actually seats: seat1 is under the gun? Let's assume seat3 is UTG+1 maybe. Anyway they raised 12. Should we call? A9s vs raise from early position. In tournament with 97 BB, still deep. A9s is a decent hand for a call, but also can be played 3-bet. Opponent's raise size is 12 (3BB). We could 3-bet to maybe 30-35 to isolate. But we are out of position (BB vs UTG). However A9s is not a strong hand to 3-bet out of position, but could be used as a steal if we think they are weak. Opponent's raise patterns: they've raised amounts 12, 12, 16, 18. So they sometimes raise larger. Probably a standard raise. So call is reasonable to see flop with A9s. Pot odds: call 8 to win 18+8=26 pot? Actually pot before action 18, opponent raised to 12, so pot now 18+8 (call) = 26? Wait initial pot: 2+4 =6? Actually blinds 2/4, pot 18 chips includes blinds and maybe previous? The pot listed is 18. So call 8 adds to pot making 26. So odds ~8/26 = 30.8% needed to break even. A9s vs unknown range maybe ~20% equity preflop. Might be a bit under. But could be okay to call.\n\nConsider tournament: 97 BB, we have decent stack. Could also raise to 30 to take initiative. But raising out of position with A9s might be risky; if they 4-bet, we are in trouble. But they are early and may not 4-bet often. However 4-bet range likely strong.\n\nThus likely best to call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\n",

No pair, no straight draws. Straight possibilities? Board: T,3,8,6,2. Our 9 gives potential straight 6-7-8-9-T? But we lack 7. No. Ace high. Opponent (Seat 3) bet 8 into pot 34, so pot will be 42 after call. Call 8 gives pot odds 8/(34+8)=8/42=19% approx. Need equity >19% to call. Our hand likely weak. Opponent's range: They raised preflop to 12 (3bb) from seat 3 (likely UTG? Not sure). They called our BB. So they likely have a range of strong hands: maybe broadway, pairs, suited connectors, etc. Flop and turn checks both. River bet 8 small. Could be a bluff or value with weak pair like 8,6,3,2, T? Actually board has no pair, they could have made pair on river like 8? But they'd have had pair earlier. Could be a missed draw, they might bluff. But our hand is Ace high, not likely to win. Let's consider opponent's possible holdings: Could have Ace with something, but they'd have Ace high anyway. Could have KQ, QJ, etc. Could have a missed draw like 7-9 (makes straight 6-7-8-9-T). Actually 7-9 would have made straight on river (7 on board? No 7 not on board). Straight would be 6-7-8-9-T, we have 9, board has 6,8,T, need 7. Opponent could have 7? If they have 7x, they'd have straight on river. So they'd bet for value. Our Ace high loses. Could have pair of 2,3,6,8,10. They could have 10x (makes pair of tens) they'd have top pair, they'd bet. So likely we are behind. Small bet could be a bluff with missed draws like JQ, QK, etc. But equity still low. Should we call? Maybe fold.\n\nStack: we have 381 chips, can call 8 easily. No all-in.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

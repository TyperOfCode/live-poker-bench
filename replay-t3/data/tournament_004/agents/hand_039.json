Pot odds (28.6% equity needed) don't justify playing this weak hand.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand: Js 5c** - This is a very weak hand. J5o has very little potential, especially from the CO position after a raise from seat 2.\n\n**Position:** CO - Not terrible position, but we have 3 players behind us (BTN, SB, BB) who could potentially raise.\n\n**Stack:** 119 chips (29.8 BB) - Healthy stack, but not huge.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (3x BB). Looking at their history, they raise frequently preflop with varying sizes. They've raised to 12 multiple times (hands 25, 31, 32, 33, 35). They seem to be an aggressive player.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has only raised twice in the history shown, both times small raises.\n- We still have BTN (Seat 4: MiniMax-M2), SB (Seat 5), and BB (Seat 1) to act after us.\n\n**Pot Odds:** Pot is currently 18 (12 raise + 2 SB + 4 BB). We need to call 12 to win 30 (18+12). That's 2.5:1 odds, or 28.6% equity needed.\n\n**Hand Equity:** J5o has very little equity against a typical raising range. Even against a wide range, it's probably around 30-35% equity at best. But we're out of position against the raiser and have players behind who could squeeze.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** With 29.8 BB, we're not desperate. We should be looking for better spots. J5o is a hand that rarely makes strong hands and is dominated often.\n\n**My History:** I've been folding a lot (29 folds in 38 hands). This might be good for table image - I appear tight. I should continue playing tight with this weak hand.\n\n**Decision:** This is an easy fold. J5o is not playable after a raise, especially with players left to act. The pot odds are decent but the implied odds are terrible since we're out of position with a weak hand that rarely makes strong hands. We'd be putting in 10% of our stack with a hand that will often be dominated or miss the flop completely.\n\nBetter to preserve our stack and wait for a better spot.",

I have a premium pocket pair that plays well in position\n2. The opponent's 12-chip raise suggests a wide range\n3. I have 43+ BBs, giving me room to play post-flop\n4. I'm in position which gives me a significant advantage\n\nI should raise to build the pot with my strong hand and get value from worse holdings.

They've raised 12 chips in the last few hands (hands 25, 31, 32, 33, 35), which is the same amount as their current raise. They also have some showdown information:\n\n1. Hand #3: They had Jd Ad (Jack-Ace offsuit) and the board was Th Qd 6s 4c 6d - they likely won with the Ace high or pair of Aces\n2. Hand #19: They had As Kh (Ace-King suited) and the board was 9h Ah 3c 2s 9d - they likely won with a pair of Aces\n\nThis suggests they play fairly wide ranges and are comfortable raising with various hands. With 253 chips, they have a decent stack size.\n\nNow, let me think about my situation:\n- I have pocket tens (Td Ts) which is a very strong hand\n- I'm in position (BTN) which is excellent \n- I have 173 chips (43.2 BB) - decent stack size\n- The raise is 12 chips, so I need to call 12 to see the flop\n- This represents about 7% of my stack, which is reasonable\n\nWith pocket tens in position against someone who raises frequently, I should definitely continue. I have a few options:\n1. Call to see the flop and play position\n2. Raise to build the pot and get value\n\nGiven that this is a tournament and I have pocket tens, which is a very strong hand but vulnerable to overcards, I think a call is reasonable here. I want to see the flop and potentially trap if they have a weaker hand. Raising might scare away weaker hands that could pay me off.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that with 43+ BBs, I have enough chips to make a raise that builds the pot properly. If I call, the pot will be around 30 chips, and I'll have about 161 chips left. If I raise to around 35-40 chips total, that would be a stronger play to build a pot with my strong hand.\n \nThe tournament dynamics suggest I should be cautious about playing too passively. While pocket tens are strong, I'm facing a player who has shown a tendency to raise frequently across multiple hands. The 12-chip raise seems consistent with their playing style, so I need to be strategic about how I respond. A call keeps me in the hand while allowing me to see how the opponent plays the flop, which could provide valuable information about their hand strength and intentions.",

Pot currently 56 (SB posted 2, BB posted 4, plus raises). Actions: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, Seat2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (so min raise to 12?). Actually raise from 4 to 12 is raise of 8, but they call it raise 12 (total). Then Seat3 folded, Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 38. So they re-raised (3-bet) to 38. Amount to call is 36 (i.e., need to add 36 more to match 38, because we already posted 2). Minimum raise to: 64 (so if we raise, must raise to at least 64 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call 38, or raise to at least 64. Hand is AJo in SB facing a 3-bet from MiniMax-M2 (seat4) after a raise from Kimi-K2 (seat2). Stack sizes: Kimi-K2 253 chips, MiniMax-M2 135 chips, us 345, BB seat1 91 chips.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall MiniMax-M2 raise patterns: only one raise found: hand 14 preflop raise amount 4 (tiny raise). That's not much info. Kimi-K2 raise patterns: many raises of 12, 18, 26, etc. Not huge.\n\nWe have limited info. Our hand AJo is decent but not premium. In SB, out of position. Facing 3-bet from MiniMax-M2 with 135 chips (approx 33 BB). They could be shoving? Actually they raised to 38, which is about 9.5 BB (since big blind is 4). 38/4 = 9.5 BB. That's a sizable 3-bet.\n\nOur stack 86 BB, we could call 36 more (to 38 total). That would be about 9.5 BB call, leaving us with ~76 BB after call. Is that advisable? AJo vs unknown range. Could be okay to call if we think they are 3-betting light. But being out of position, maybe better to fold unless we have a good read.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 only one raise recorded (4). That suggests they rarely 3-bet? Could be that they are tight and only raise small amounts. But we have no info on their 3-bet frequency.\n\nKimi-K2's raise to 12 (initial raise). They are medium stack 253. Their raise size 12 (3 BB). That's a standard open.\n\nMiniMax-M2's 3-bet to 38 is large (approx 9.5 BB). Could be a strong hand (AA, KK, AK, maybe AQ). Our AJo is not top 5% but still decent.\n\nWe also have to consider tournament: stack 86 BB, not short. Could afford to fold.\n\nThus likely fold.\n\nBut also could consider calling and seeing flop, but out of position.\n\nGiven limited info, I'd fold.\n\nLet's produce JSON.",

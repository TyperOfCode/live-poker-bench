            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 9\u26655\u2665 - suited but weak connectors\n- My stack: 144 chips (9 BB)\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 has only 8 chips left (0.5 BB) and posted SB of 8\n- Pot: 117 chips (includes SB 8 + BB 16 + opponent's raise 101)\n- Amount to call: 85 chips\n\n**Key Observations:**\n1. Kimi-K2 has only 8 chips total - they posted SB of 8 and then raised 101. This means they're effectively all-in with their remaining stack.\n2. Looking at opponent history: Kimi-K2 has been raising frequently (hands 71-73 with raises of 121, 61, 101). They seem aggressive, especially when short-stacked.\n3. The pot is 117 chips and it costs me 85 to call. That's pot odds of roughly 1.38:1 (117:85) or 42% equity needed.\n4. My hand is 9\u26655\u2665 - weak suited connectors. Against a random hand, I have about 38% equity. Against a typical all-in range from a short stack, I probably need closer to 42-45%.\n5. My stack is 144 chips (9 BB). If I fold, I have 144 chips left. If I call and lose, I'm down to 59 chips (3.7 BB) - critically short.\n6. If I call and win, I get to 229 chips (14.3 BB) - a much healthier stack.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- This is a critical spot. With 9 BB, I'm already short but not desperate.\n- Kimi-K2 has only 0.5 BB left, so they're desperate and likely shoving with a wide range.\n- The pot already has 117 chips (7.3 BB), which is significant relative to my stack.\n\n**Mathematical Analysis:**\n- Pot odds: 85 to win 117 \u2192 need ~42% equity\n- 9\u26655\u2665 vs a typical short-stack shoving range (top 50% of hands): ~37-40% equity\n- 9\u26655\u2665 vs top 30%: ~35% equity\n- 9\u26655\u2665 vs top 20%: ~32% equity\n\nGiven the opponent's desperation (0.5 BB left) and their aggressive history, they're likely shoving very wide - probably top 60-70% of hands. Against that range, my equity is borderline.\n\nHowever, there's also the consideration that if I fold here, I still have 9 BB and can look for better spots. Calling and losing would cripple me to 3.7 BB.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is close, but I think folding is better. The pot odds require ~42% equity, and 9\u26655\u2665 against even a wide range is unlikely to have that much. Additionally, preserving my 9 BB stack for better opportunities seems prudent. The opponent's desperation makes their range wide, but 9\u26655\u2665 is just too weak even against a wide range.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9h5h is too weak even against a desperate short stack's wide range.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n1. **Hand Analysis**: I have Qd 3h - this is a very weak hand, especially from UTG position. Q3o (queen-three offsuit) is one of the weakest hands you can have in poker, especially from an early position.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) is the earliest position after the blinds. This means I have to act first preflop with 4-5 players still to act behind me. This makes weak hands even weaker because I have no information about what others might do.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 430 chips (26.9 BB), which is a decent stack size. However, I'm not short-stacked enough to justify playing marginal hands aggressively.\n\n4. **My UTG History**: Looking at my past UTG hands, I can see I've been very tight from this position, which is correct. I've folded most of my UTG hands including much better ones like AQo (hand #68), TJs (hand #56), K9o (hand #51), and even JTs (hand #60). This shows I've been playing very tight from UTG.\n\n5. **Opponent Analysis**: Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) seems to be folding a lot preflop based on the recent actions, and when they do play, they've shown some decent hands like AJ, AK, KJ, and 94s. This suggests they might be playing reasonably tight but capable of big hands.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 16 chips to see the flop. The pot is 24 chips, so I'm getting 24:16 = 1.5:1 pot odds. However, this doesn't account for the fact that multiple players still have to act behind me, and I'm out of position.\n\n7. **Tournament Considerations**: In a tournament, preservation of chips becomes more important as the tournament progresses. With 26.9 BB, I should be playing relatively tight and avoiding marginal hands.\n\n8. **Hand Strength**: Q3o is simply too weak to play from UTG, even in a loose game. \n\nThe mathematical expectation for this hand is overwhelmingly negative. With such a weak kicker and unfavorable position, the potential risks far outweigh any minimal chance of improvement. Folding is the most prudent decision to protect my chip stack and tournament position.",

In BTN, could attempt steal but with such weak hand, risk. Opponents stacks: SB 101 (5.0 BB), BB 144 (9 BB). Both are shortish; they may defend. Our stack 14.5 BB, we could raise to steal blinds, but risk being called and out of position with weak hand. Could also just call? Not typical to call with such hand. Could fold.\n\nConsider tournament stage? Not given. We have 14.5 BB, medium. Might want to preserve chips. Better fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

Actually 3d 4s - offsuit, not suited. Very weak hand.\n\nOur stack: 228 chips (14.2 BB) - not deep but not super short either.\n\nOpponent tendencies from recall: Seat 2 has raised preflop in 2 of 10 hands (hand 57: raise 20, hand 61: raise 48). Both were from SB position? Actually hand 57 and 61 they raised. They seem to fold a lot preflop (6 folds in 10 hands). Their raises might be stealing attempts.\n\nPot odds: We need to call 16 to win 48 pot. That's 3:1 odds (25% equity needed). With 34o, we have very little equity against a raising range. Even against a wide stealing range, 34o is terrible.\n\nImplied odds: If we hit a flop, we might get more chips, but we're out of position and with a weak hand that's hard to play.\n\nTournament considerations: We have 14.2 BB, which is getting short but not critical. Folding preserves our stack. Calling with such a weak hand out of position is generally bad.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. The opponent's raise size (2x BB over SB) is standard. We have no strong reason to defend with 34o.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors. The opponent has 207 chips (12.9 BB), so they're slightly shorter than us. They might be trying to steal.\n\nBut still, 34o is just too weak. Even if they're stealing wide, we should defend with better hands. We're getting 3:1 odds but need much better implied odds to play such a weak hand.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Actually we haven't posted anything. Amount to call 16 (big blind). Minimum raise to 32. We are short stack, need to find spots to shove. Kc4c is weak. Could consider all-in (raise to 118). But is that good? With 7 BB, we could push or fold. K4 suited is marginal. In BTN, we could steal blinds with any decent hand, but K4c is low. Opponents: Seat 2 (SB) 231 chips, Seat3 (BB) 228 chips. Both have decent stacks. SB may defend range. BB will have already posted 16. If we shove, we risk being called by BB with any decent hand. Probably fold.\n\nCheck if any recall needed? Could check opponent tendencies, but likely not needed. Decision: fold.\n\nReturn JSON.",

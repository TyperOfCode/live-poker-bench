            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 4s 4h - Pocket 4s, a small pocket pair\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - Best position post-flop\n**Stack:** 219 chips (109.5 BB) - Healthy stack\n**Pot:** 3 chips (1 SB + 2 BB)\n**To call:** 2 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): SB, 73 chips, fairly active player based on history. They've shown they can raise preflop and call down to river. They folded to a raise in hand 4.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): BB, 121 chips, seems more passive. They check a lot and have folded several times preflop. They called down in hand 3 but folded on the river.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Pocket 4s is a speculative hand. It has good potential to flop a set (about 1 in 8.5 chance) which is very strong. Otherwise, it's often an underpair on the flop.\n\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** \n   - SB is somewhat aggressive but has folded to pressure\n   - BB is more passive, likes to check and fold\n\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 2 to win 3, getting 1.5:1 odds. This is not great for set-mining (typically want 15:1+ implied odds).\n\n5. **Stack sizes:** Both opponents have relatively short stacks (36.5 BB and 60.5 BB respectively). This limits my implied odds if I hit a set.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** With a healthy 109.5 BB stack, I can afford to see flops with speculative hands, especially in position. However, the short stacks of my opponents reduce the value of set-mining.\n\n**Decision:** I should call. Here's why:\n- I'm in the best position (button)\n- The cost is only 2 chips (1% of my stack)\n- Even though implied odds are limited by short stacks, I have position advantage\n- If I miss the flop, I can easily fold to aggression\n- If I hit a set, I can potentially win their entire stacks\n- Folding would be too tight given the price and position\n\nI don't want to raise because:\n- Raising to 4 chips gives me poor risk/reward\n- I'm unlikely to get folds from both players with such a small raise\n- I'd be building a pot with a hand that needs to hit the flop to be good\n\nI'll call and see the flop in position.",

            "reasoning_content": "  The query returned no results, which means I don't have any specific history on Seat 2's preflop raising patterns yet. Let me think about this spot:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I have pocket 4s (44) on the BTN\n- Stack: 217 chips (108.5 BB) - very healthy\n- SB raised from 1 to 8 after I called the BB\n- Pot: 12 + my 2 call + SB's raise to 8 = ~20 chips\n- I need to call 6 more chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Pocket 4s is a marginal hand preflop. It plays well in multiway pots where I can hit a set, but poorly heads-up against typical raising ranges.\n\n2. **Position**: I have position on the SB which is good, but we're likely going heads-up.\n\n3. **Opponent**: I have no specific reads on Seat 2 yet since there were no matches in my search. But with only 66 chips (33 BB), they're in push/fold territory or making desperate moves.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 6 to win 20, which is about 3.3:1. This is decent but not great for a small pocket pair where I'm usually ~8:1 to hit a set.\n\n5. **Stack preservation**: With 108.5 BB, I can afford to call here, but I need to consider reverse implied odds - if I hit my set, can I get paid enough to justify the times I miss?\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have a big stack relative to the opponent. Calling keeps me involved but doesn't commit me. However, I should be careful not to bleed chips with marginal hands.\n\n**Decision**: I think calling is reasonable here. The opponent has a short stack (33 BB) and might be making a move. I have position, and the price is reasonable. If I hit my set, I can potentially win their entire stack. If I miss, I can easily fold on the flop.\n\nLet me call.",

The board is 3-5-8 with two different suits. This is a very dangerous board for pocket fours. Any 6 or 7 makes a straight, and there are many overcards that could beat me. I only have 2 outs (the remaining two 4s) to improve to a set.\n\n2. **Opponent Analysis:** Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown:\n   - In hand #3, they raised preflop with AdJd, called on flop, turn, and bet on river\n   - They've been active and aggressive\n   - In this hand, they raised preflop from SB and are now betting on the flop\n   - They have a relatively short stack (54 chips, about 27 BB)\n\n3. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 30, I need to call 12. That's 30:12 or 2.5:1 odds. This means I need ~28.6% equity to break even on a call.\n\n4. **Implied Odds:** With a short-stacked opponent (54 chips total), my implied odds are limited. Even if I hit my set, I can't win that much more.\n\n5. **Board Texture:** This is a very coordinated board (3-5-8). My opponent could easily have:\n   - Any overpair (66+)\n   - Any two cards that connect with this board (6-7, 6-9, 7-9 for straight draws)\n   - Any 6 or 7 for an open-ended straight draw\n   - Any two spades for a flush draw\n   - Any two cards 8 or higher\n\n6. **Equity:** Against a reasonable range (any pair, any two cards 8+, any straight draw, any flush draw), my 44 has very low equity - likely under 20%.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. My hand is too weak for this coordinated board, I'm facing aggression from an opponent who has shown strength, the pot odds don't justify calling with just 2 outs, and the opponent is short-stacked so implied odds are poor. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

They've folded to raises before.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 1 chip to win a 5-chip pot, getting 5:1 odds which is excellent.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With a medium stack, I should look for spots to accumulate chips without risking my tournament life unnecessarily.\n\nGiven the excellent pot odds and decent hand strength, I should definitely play this hand. With position disadvantage, I should raise to try to take control of the hand and potentially win it preflop or on the flop with a continuation bet.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A9s is a strong hand against a single limper.

The hand has very little potential and being out of position makes it even less attractive. The risk of being raised or called by players with stronger hands is high.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot with a stronger hand or when I'm in a better position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K6 offsuit is weak in UTG position.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ks 6c - This is a King offsuit, which is a decent starting hand but not premium. The 6 is low and doesn't connect well with the King.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position in poker. I'm first to act preflop, which means I have to act before seeing what anyone else does. This makes it difficult to get value with marginal hands.\n\n3. **My stack**: 186 chips (93 BB) - I'm at about 93 big blinds deep, which is a deep stack situation. This means I can afford to be patient and wait for better spots.\n\n4. **Situation**: I'm facing a call of 2 chips (to match the big blind), with a minimum raise to 4 chips. The pot is currently 3 chips.\n\n5. **Considerations**:\n   - K6 offsuit is a weak hand, especially in early position\n   - I'm UTG, so I have no information about what other players will do\n   - With 93 BB, I can afford to fold and wait for a better spot\n   - Raising with K6 UTG would be speculative at best\n   - Calling with this hand would be questionable as I'm out of position\n\nGiven that K6 offsuit is a weak hand in early position, and I'm UTG with no information about the table, folding seems like the most prudent decision. This hand has very little potential and being out of position makes it even less attractive.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot with a stronger hand or when I'm in a better position.\n",

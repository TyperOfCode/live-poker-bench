            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: Kd Th (King of diamonds, Ten of hearts)\n**Position**: UTG (Under the Gun - first to act)\n**Stack**: 89 chips (11.1 BB) - this is quite short\n**Blinds**: 4/8\n**Pot**: 12 chips\n**To call**: 8 chips\n\nThis is a tournament situation with a short stack (11.1 BB). I'm in the worst position (UTG).\n\n**Hand analysis**:\n- KTo is a marginal hand, especially from UTG\n- It's offsuit, which reduces its playability\n- From early position, this is generally a fold in most situations\n- With a short stack, I need to be more selective, not less\n\n**Opponent observations from the data**:\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) made a big raise (38 chips) in hand 39 from SB position\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has been active, raising to 8 in hand 40 and 24 in hand 42\n- In hand 42, GPT-OSS-120B raised to 24, got called by Kimi-K2, then bet 30 on flop and folded to a turn bet\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) seems tight, folding multiple times\n\n**Tournament considerations**:\n- With 11.1 BB, I'm in the danger zone but not yet desperate\n- I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not calling raises\n- From UTG, I need a very strong hand to play\n- KTo is too weak to open from UTG with this stack size\n\n**Pot odds**: Calling 8 to win 12 = 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed, but this is irrelevant since I'm not closing the action and my hand is too weak.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. KTo from UTG with a short stack is not a profitable play. I need to preserve my chips for better spots, preferably in late position or with stronger hands. \n\nI'll save my limited chips for more promising opportunities. The risk of losing more chips with a marginal hand is too high, especially when I'm already short-stacked. Waiting for a stronger position and better cards is the most strategic move.",

            "reasoning_content": "Now let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm on the Button with Qh 8d. This is a marginal hand, but I have position advantage. My stack is 119 chips (14.9 BB) - relatively short stacked. The blinds are 4/8.\n\nPlayers left to act:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): SB with 179 chips, posted 4 already\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): BB with 289 chips, posted 8 already\n\nFrom opponent analysis:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been folding a lot preflop (8 out of 10 recent hands). Only raised once in hand #39. Seems tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been active recently with raises in hands #40 and #42. Shows some aggression.\n\nThe pot is currently 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8). I need to call 8 chips to see the flop. That's about 6.7% of my stack.\n\nGiven my position on the button, if both opponents are relatively tight, I could consider raising to try to steal the blinds. However, Q8o is not a great hand - it's offsuit and has limited connectivity.\n\nWith 14.9 BB stack, I'm in push/fold territory. Standard short stack strategy would suggest shoving with a wider range from the button, but Q8o is borderline.\n\nLet me check pot odds: I need to call 8 to win 20 (12 current pot + 8 from my call). That's 2.5:1 odds, or 28.6% equity needed.\n\nAgainst typical SB and BB calling ranges, Q8o has about 35-40% equity. So mathematically, calling might be okay if I expect no further action.\n\nHowever, if I raise, I risk getting re-raised by the BB who has shown recent aggression. My stack is too small to comfortably play post-flop with this marginal hand.\n\nGiven my short stack and tournament survival considerations, I think folding is reasonable. Q8o is a weak hand, and while position helps, I don't want to commit chips with such a marginal holding when I'm short but not desperate.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot. Let's fold.",

It's not premium, but it's playable in position, especially when I'm getting good pot odds.\n\n**Opponent Analysis - GPT-OSS-120B:**\nFrom the data I retrieved:\n- In recent hands, GPT-OSS-120B has been quite active preflop\n- Hand #40: Raised to 8 chips preflop\n- Hand #42: Raised to 24 chips preflop (this is significant - a 3x raise)\n- Shows tendency to bet aggressively when in position\n- Has 289 chips (36 BB) - decent stack size\n\n**My BTN Performance:**\nLooking at my button history:\n- 42 hands played from BTN position\n- Win rate: ~9.5% (4 wins out of 42 hands)\n- Generally been folding a lot from BTN\n- Had one successful raise with pocket tens (Hand #39) that won 56 chips\n- One successful raise with A8s (Hand #14) that won 12 chips\n\n**Pot Odds Analysis:**\n- Amount to call: 4 chips\n- Pot size: 12 chips\n- Pot odds: 4/16 = 25%\n- I need about 25% equity to make this call profitable\n\n**Position Advantage:**\n- I'm in position (BTN), which gives me a significant advantage\n- I get to act last on all postflop streets\n- This makes suited connectors more valuable\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\n- 179 chips = 22.4 BB\n- Not short stacked yet, but need to be somewhat careful\n\n\n- Facing an aggressive opponent who has shown recent preflop raising\n\nI recognize the strategic complexity of this hand. The suited connectors offer potential for drawing combinations, while the opponent's recent aggressive play suggests I need to carefully evaluate my position. Calling 4 chips seems reasonable given the pot odds and my positional advantage, allowing me to see the flop without a significant commitment.\n\nThe raise to 16 chips introduces more nuanced considerations. While it might pressure the opponent, the suited connectors aren't strong enough to justify aggressive betting. My goal remains to control the pot size and extract maximum value from my position.\n\nUltimately, the call appears to be the most mathematically sound decision, leveraging my positional advantage and the potential of my hand.\n",

I have very few outs to improve to a winning hand - mainly straight draws that require specific cards (7-10 or 10-J).\n\n**Board Analysis**: Kc 6c 3d is a relatively dry board with a potential flush draw. The King is an overcard to my hand, making my 9s 8c even weaker in terms of showdown value.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Based on my memory, GPT-OSS-120B has been playing somewhat passively. In the previous hand, they raised preflop and bet the flop but folded when faced with resistance on the turn, suggesting they may not be committed to marginal hands.\n\n**Position & Stack**: I'm in the button position with a decent stack (21.9 BB), which gives me positional advantage.\n\n**Pot Odds**: With 16 chips in the pot and no bet to call, I can see a free card.\n\nGiven my weak hand strength and the board texture, I should check behind to:\n1. See a free turn card \n2. Avoid investing more chips with a marginal hand\n3. Potentially induce a bluff from the opponent on later streets\n\nThe flush draw on the board gives some equity if my opponent has a club, but with my weak hand, I should be conservative.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Weak suited connector (9s 8c) with little showdown value on a K-high board with flush draw.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the opponent's recent history:\n\n1. GPT-OSS-120B has been quite passive preflop, mostly folding and occasionally calling\n2. In hand #42 (the previous hand), they raised to 24 preflop, then bet 30 on the flop, but checked the turn and folded when faced with action\n3. They seem to be playing somewhat straightforward - when they bet, they often fold to resistance\n4. They haven't shown any particularly aggressive tendencies\n\nNow let me analyze my current situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 9s 8c - this is a weak suited connector, essentially a drawing hand with little showdown value\n**Board**: Kc 6c 3d - this is a relatively dry board with a potential flush draw (clubs)\n**Position**: I'm in position (BTN) which is advantageous\n**Stack**: 175 chips (21.9 BB) - decent stack size\n**Pot**: 16 chips\n\nSince GPT-OSS-120B checked on the flop, this gives me several options:\n1. Check behind to see a free card\n2. Make a small bet to try to take the pot down\n3. Fold (but this seems too weak given the pot odds)\n\nGiven my weak hand (9s 8c) and the board texture, I have very little showdown value. The best I can hope for is to make a straight or two pair, but with 9-8, my straight possibilities are limited (I need 7-10 or 10-J to make straights, and I already have 9-8).\n\nThe board has a flush draw (clubs), so if my opponent has a club, they might call a bet hoping to hit their flush.\n\nHowever, given my weak hand and the fact that I'm out of position to act next (though I am in position now), I think the most reasonable play is to check behind. This allows me to:\n\n\nI'll evaluate my strategic options carefully. Checking behind offers multiple advantages - I get to see a free card, avoid unnecessary chip investment with a marginal hand, and potentially induce a bluff from my opponent. The flush draw complicates things, but my weak hand doesn't justify aggressive play. By checking, I maintain my stack flexibility and avoid committing chips with a hand that has limited winning potential.",

Since SB just called, they likely have a wide range (maybe any pair, suited connectors, etc). Raising to 16 (8 more) is small, could be a standard raise. If they call, we see flop.

We have Tc (clubs), so we have a nut flush draw? The highest club on board is Kc, we have Tc, so we have the nut flush draw (Ace-high flush not possible because Ace not on board; we have Ten of clubs, board Kc and 6c, we need any club higher than Ten? Actually flush draws: we need 5 clubs. Currently we have two clubs (Kc, 6c, Tc). Need 2 more clubs.

Opponent may have Kx, or a draw. Checking might allow free cards, but also gives opponent chance to check-raise? Not likely.\n\nGiven pot 16, we could bet ~ half pot (8) to build pot and protect. Minimum raise is 8 (to total 8). We can raise to 8 (i.e., bet 8). That seems good. Opponent's stack is 175, can call.\n\nWe should consider tournament stage: we have 36 BB, comfortable.

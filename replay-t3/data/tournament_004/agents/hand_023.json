            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand:** Qs Qc (pocket queens)\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - excellent position\n**Stack:** 113 chips (28.2 BB) - relatively short stack\n**Blinds:** 2/4\n**Pot:** 6 chips (SB + BB)\n**To call:** 4 chips\n**Min raise:** 8 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): 175 chips, has been folding a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop)\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): 389 chips, also folding a lot recently\n\n**My analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength:** Pocket queens is a premium hand, 3rd best starting hand after AA and KK. I should definitely play this aggressively.\n\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is ideal - I get to act last post-flop.\n\n3. **Stack size:** At 28BB, I'm short-stacked. With QQ, I want to build a pot and potentially get all-in preflop if the situation arises.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies:** Both opponents have been folding frequently preflop recently. This suggests they might be playing tight. However, the BB (GPT-OSS-120B) showed some aggression in hand 18 with a river bet.\n\n5. **Action considerations:**\n   - Just calling 4 chips is too passive with QQ\n   - Folding is obviously not an option\n   - Raising is the standard play here\n\n**Raise sizing considerations:**\n- Min raise to 8 chips (4 more) is too small - gives too good odds\n- Standard raise would be 3-4x BB, so 12-16 chips\n- With my stack size, I could consider a larger raise to set up a potential shove on later streets\n\nGiven my stack is only 113 chips (28BB), a raise to around 16-20 chips (4-5x BB) would be reasonable. This would commit about 14-18% of my stack, making it easier to get all-in on later streets if needed.\n\nI'll raise to 16 chips (12 more). This is 4x BB and should get folds from marginal hands while building the pot with my premium hand.",

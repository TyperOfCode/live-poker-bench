With a short stack of 21.2 BB, I need to preserve chips for better spots. Both opponents have shown they can be active (BB has raised recently, SB is tight but unpredictable), making a steal attempt too risky with this hand. Clear fold.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Ks 3d is a very weak hand. It's offsuit, has a huge gap, and the 3 is very low. This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. However, I still have to get through the SB and BB first.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 85 chips (21.2 BB). This is a relatively short stack in tournament play. I need to be careful about preserving my chips.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - **Seat 2 (SB)**: Looking at their recent actions, they've been folding a lot preflop (hands 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29). They did raise to 12 in hand 25 but then check-folded on the flop. They seem tight/passive.\n   - **Seat 3 (BB)**: They've been more active with raises in hands 24 and 28. In hand 28, they raised preflop, checked flop and turn, then bet on river. They seem more aggressive than the SB.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win a pot of 6 chips. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, which would require me to win 40% of the time to break even. With K3o, I definitely don't have that equity against typical calling/raising ranges.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 21.2 BB, I'm not in desperation mode yet, but I should be selective. K3o is simply too weak to play, even on the button. The risk of losing 4 chips (almost 5% of my stack) with such a weak hand isn't worth it.\n\n7. **Raising as a steal?**: Even though both opponents have shown tendencies to fold, K3o is just too weak. If I get called, I'll be in bad shape post-flop. And with my shortish stack, I can't afford to make speculative plays.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, my stack is too short to make speculative plays, and I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

            "reasoning_content": "Now I have a good understanding of the situation. Let me analyze:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: Q\u2666 2\u2665 - This is a weak hand. Queen-deuce offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n- Position: BB (out of position for the entire hand)\n- Stack: 129 chips (32.2 BB) - decent stack but not huge\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 in SB with 211 chips\n- Action: SB raised to 12 total (8 more to call)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the data, Kimi-K2 is quite active preflop, raising frequently from various positions. They've shown hands like A\u2666 J\u2666 (hand #3) and A\u2660 K\u2665 (hand #19) when they've gotten to showdown. They seem to have a wide raising range, especially from SB where they're stealing blinds.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 16 chips (blinds + raise)\n- To call: 8 chips\n- Pot odds: 8/(16+8) = 8/24 = 33.3%\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\nI have 129 chips total. Calling 8 chips represents about 6.2% of my stack. If I call, the pot will be 24 chips going to the flop.\n\n**Hand Strength vs. Expected Range:**\nQ2o is crushed against most of Kimi-K2's raising range. Even if they're stealing wide, they likely have hands like any pair, any Broadway, suited connectors, etc. Q2o has poor equity against that range.\n\n**Position:**\nBeing out of position with such a weak hand is terrible. I'll have to act first on every street, making it difficult to realize any equity I might have.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have a decent stack (32 BB). Folding here preserves my stack for better spots. Calling with Q2o out of position against what appears to be an aggressive opponent is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n**Alternative: Raising**\nI could consider a 3-bet bluff, but with such a weak hand and being out of position, this is risky. Kimi-K2 has shown they can call down with strong hands (like AK in hand #19). They might 4-bet or call with a better hand.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is an easy fold. Q2o is unplayable from the BB against a SB raise, even with decent pot odds. The positional disadvantage and hand weakness make this a clear fold. I should wait for better spots.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q2o is unplayable from BB against SB raise. Poor hand strength, out of position disadvantage, and opponent's aggressive but competent play make this an easy fold. Better to preserve 32 BB stack for stronger spots.\"\n}",

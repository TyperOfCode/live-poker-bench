My opponent's turn bet could indicate they have a strong hand or are semi-bluffing.\n\nGiven the marginal equity and my decent stack size, this is a clear fold situation.

I have 122 chips total, and calling 40 would put me at 82 chips remaining.

From the small blind, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nAlso, I'm in a tournament with 7.6 BB stack. This is short but not desperate yet.

The BB (MiniMax-M2) still has to act behind me with 396 chips.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot. I'm in the SB, will be in better position soon.

            "reasoning_content": "Looking at Kimi-K2's recent preflop raising patterns, I can see they have been raising to various amounts:\n- Most frequently to 12 chips (standard 3x BB)\n- Some raises to 20-24 chips \n- One larger raise to 75 chips in hand #33\n\nTheir current raise to 48 chips is on the higher end of their range but not unusual. This suggests they might have a stronger hand, but I shouldn't fold Ts Jh just based on this sizing.\n\nGiven the pot odds and the fact that Ts Jh has decent equity and playability post-flop, I think calling is the right move here. I can see the flop and potentially make strong hands like straights, flushes, or top pairs.",

They raised preflop to 48 chips, suggesting a decent but not premium hand.\n\n**Situation:**\n- Pot: 104 chips\n- My stack: 364 chips (22.8 BB)\n- Opponent's stack: 255 chips\n- I'm first to act on the flop\n\nGiven my draws and overcards, I have reasonable equity. A check allows me to see their action while keeping the pot manageable. If they bet, I can call with my draws and potentially improve. If they check back, I get a free card.\n\nThe minimum raise of 32 chips seems too small to be effective - it would give them good pot odds to call with many hands.\n\nI'll check and evaluate based on their response.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking with my flush draw and gutshot straight draw.

This suggests they might have a decent hand, but not necessarily premium since they didn't 4-bet or make a huge raise.\n\nSince I'm first to act on the flop (the action is on me), I need to decide whether to:\n1. Check and see what they do\n2. Make a small bet to take control\n3. Check-raise\n\nGiven that:\n- I have some equity with the flush draw and gutshot straight draw\n- The board isn't too threatening (no obvious straights or flushes completed)\n- Kimi-K2 seems to bet about 40% of the time on the flop\n\n\n- I want to control the pot size and potentially get value from my draws\n\nI'll lean towards a strategic check to keep the pot manageable while giving myself a chance to improve my hand. The flush and gutshot straight draws provide some potential upside, but I need to be cautious about the opponent's likely range.\n",

The flush draw and overcards provide compelling reasons to be aggressive. By raising, I can potentially force a fold from a weaker hand or set up a strong betting opportunity if the river completes my flush. The 32-chip minimum raise offers an excellent opportunity to test the opponent's resolve while maintaining a controlled investment in the hand.",

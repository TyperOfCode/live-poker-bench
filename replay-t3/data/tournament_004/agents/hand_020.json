            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Td 2h - This is a very weak hand, offsuit and with a gap. Ten-deuce is one of the worst starting hands in Texas Hold'em.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position. This gives me an advantage post-flop.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for the BB player (Seat 2):\n   - They fold frequently preflop (hands 13, 14, 17, 18)\n   - When they do raise, they raise to 6-18 chips in a 1/2 blind game (3-9x the big blind)\n   - In hand 19, they showed down AsKh (premium hand) after being aggressive\n   - They seem to be a relatively tight player who raises with strong hands\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 93 chips (46.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - BB has 216 chips (108 BB) - deep stack\n\n5. **Pot odds**: \n   - Pot is 3 chips\n   - I need to call 1 chip\n   - Getting 3:1 immediate pot odds\n   - However, with T2o, even 3:1 odds aren't enough to justify playing this hand\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I have a healthy stack of 46.5 BB\n   - No need to take marginal spots\n   - Preserving chips is important\n   - Even though I'm on the Button and might get to see a cheap flop, T2o has very poor playability post-flop\n\n7. **Action**: Everyone folded to me on the Button. I can fold, call 1 chip, or raise to at least 4 chips.\n\nWith T2o, this is a clear fold. Even with position, the hand is just too weak. The opponent in the BB is tight and will likely defend their blind with better hands. I don't want to invest chips in a situation where I'm dominated so often.\n\nIf I were to raise as a steal, I'd need to make it at least 4 chips (minimum raise), which is 2x the BB. Against a tight player, this might work sometimes, but:\n- I'm risking 4 chips to win 3\n- The BB has shown they'll defend/raise with strong hands\n- T2o has terrible post-flop playability if called\n\nThe best play is to fold and wait for a better spot.",

UTG is the worst position to play from, especially with a weak hand like this. I have 113 chips (56.5 BB), which is a decent stack but not huge.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Seat 1: 93 chips (46.5 BB) - posted SB\n- Seat 2: 216 chips (108 BB) - posted BB  \n- Seat 4: 181 chips (90.5 BB) - will act after me\n- Seat 5: 393 chips (196.5 BB) - has the big stack\n\nFrom my recall, MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has raised preflop once (hand 14). GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) has also raised preflop once (hand 2). So both are capable of aggression.\n\nWith 2c8c, I have:\n- Very low high card strength (8 high)\n- Suited connectors but with a big gap (2-8 is not a true connector)\n- Poor position being UTG\n- Multiple players left to act behind me who could raise\n\nThe pot is 3 chips, I need to call 2 chips. That's 2/113 = 1.77% of my stack. While the immediate pot odds might seem okay, the implied odds are poor because:\n1. If I hit a flush draw, it will be obvious\n2. If I hit a pair, it will be weak (2 or 8)\n3. I'm out of position for the entire hand\n\nTournament considerations: I have 56.5 BB which is a playable stack. I should preserve it for better spots. Playing 2-8 suited from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\nLooking at my hand history: I've been folding a lot (17 folds out of 19 hands), but that's because I've been getting weak hands. My one win was from the SB with T5o, but that was a limped pot that checked down.\n\nStandard poker strategy says to fold 2-8 suited from UTG. Even if it were suited connectors like 78s or 89s, it would be marginal. But 28s is just too weak.\n\nDecision: Fold. Wait for a better spot in better position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2c8c is too weak to play from UTG position.

It has almost no potential to make a strong hand postflop.\n\n2. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 18 chips, so the pot is offering 2.25:1 odds. This is not nearly enough to justify calling with such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Position**: While I'm on the button (good position), this doesn't compensate for the terrible hand strength.\n\n4. **Stack preservation**: With 19.2 BB, I should be selective about when to commit chips. Calling with 6-2 offsuit would be a poor use of my chips.\n\n5. **Opponent's range**: Given a standard 3x raise, DeepSeek-V3.2 likely has a decent hand (broadway cards, pocket pairs, suited connectors, etc.). My 6-2 is dominated by almost everything.\n\n**Decision**: This is an easy fold. 6-2 offsuit has no business being in a raised pot. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

Players behind me: MiniMax-M2 (175 chips), GPT-OSS-120B (387 chips). BB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 77 chips.\n\nFrom my hand history, I've been folding a lot (19 folds out of 23 hands, win rate 13%). I recently won with QQ and A5s.\n\nFrom opponent data: Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB) has shown some aggression - raised to 12 in hand 21, but folded to my raises in recent hands. MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot recently (folded last 5 hands preflop). GPT-OSS-120B has the big stack.\n\nPocket 9s is a decent hand, but UTG is early position. With 29.8 BB stack, I need to be careful. Standard play would be to raise or fold. Calling is generally not good with pocket pairs as we want to build a pot for set mining or take it down preflop.\n\nIf I raise, I should consider sizing. Minimum raise is to 8, but that's only 2BB. A standard raise would be 2.5-3BB, so 10-12 chips. My stack is 119, so a raise to 12 would be reasonable.\n\nIf I get called or raised, I'm in a tricky spot postflop with a medium pair. But with my stack size, I can't afford to just limp or call.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot, so might fold to my raise. Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB) has shown some aggression but also folds to raises. GPT-OSS-120B is big stack and could put pressure.\n\nGiven my position (UTG) and hand strength, I think raising is the best play. Folding is too tight - pocket 9s is a premium hand at this stack depth. Calling is passive and doesn't define my hand.\n\nI'll raise to 12 (3BB). This is a standard raise that should get respect. If I get re-raised, I'll need to evaluate based on opponent and stack sizes.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 12,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 9s is a strong hand UTG with 29.8 BB stack.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: Jc 6s - This is a relatively weak hand, especially in early position. J6 suited is not a premium hand and has limited straight and flush potential.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BTN (Button) position, which is the most advantageous position in poker. This gives me more information and allows me to play more hands.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 175 chips (43.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. I'm not short stacked yet, so I can afford to be selective.\n\n4. **Current action**: DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 12 chips preflop. This is a 3x raise from the blinds (2/4), which is a standard raise size.\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: From the recall data, I can see that DeepSeek-V3.2 has been quite active recently:\n   - Hand #22: raised to 12 chips\n   - Hand #23: raised to 16 chips\n   - Before that, they were folding frequently (hands 12-21)\n   \n   This suggests DeepSeek-V3.2 might be on a stealing spree or has found a good hand. The fact that they've raised twice in a row suggests they might be aggressive or have a strong hand.\n\n6. **My recent performance**: From my button history, I can see I've been quite passive, folding most hands (21 out of 23). I only won one hand out of 23, which shows I need to be more selective but also not too passive.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 18 chips (2 from SB + 4 from BB + 12 from the raise = 18). I need to call 12 chips to continue.\n\n8. **Hand strength**: Jc 6s is a weak hand. While it's suited (potential for flush), J6 has very little straight potential and is generally considered a weak hand.\n \nI'm facing a challenging decision with limited options. The raise size of 12 chips is significant, and my hand lacks strong potential. With a weak suited connector and facing an aggressive opponent, the risk outweighs the potential reward. The conservative approach is to fold, preserving my chip stack for a more favorable situation. The opponent's recent aggressive play pattern suggests they might have a stronger hand, making continuation an unprofitable strategy.\n\nMy tournament position remains stable, with a decent chip stack that allows for patience. While I could consider a bluff, the aggressive history of the opponent makes this particularly risky. The smart play is to wait for a more promising hand and better circumstances.",

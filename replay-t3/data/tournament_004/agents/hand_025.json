The limper is tight, which suggests they might have something decent. I should preserve my chips for better spots. I don't want to get involved with a dominated hand like Q4o where I'm likely to be outkicked if I hit a queen.\n\nThe only consideration would be to raise as a steal since it's just MiniMax-M2 who is tight, but with 18.8 BB I should be more selective. I'll fold and wait for a better hand.",

Actually amount to call is 4 (the BB). So we can call 4, raise min to 8 (total). Hand Q5 offsuit is weak. Consider position: button, but short stack? Not short, 96 BB. Opponents: seat1 short (75 chips ~ 18.75 BB), seat2 medium, seat4 limped. Likely want to fold Q5. Could also raise as steal? But we have weak hand, and there are callers already. Raising could isolate and we may be out of position after flop because we are button but will be first to act after flop? Actually after raise, we would be last preflop, but flop order: SB, BB, UTG etc. Since we are button, we will act after them. But raising with Q5 is not advisable.

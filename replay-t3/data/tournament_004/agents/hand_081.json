            "content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the small blind with 7h 3c, a very weak hand. My stack is 128 chips (4 BB). The pot is 173 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 125 total, which is essentially a shove relative to my stack size. I need to call 109 to win 173+109=282? Wait, let's calculate: pot is 173 (including my SB 16 and BB 32, plus Seat 2's 125). Actually, I think Seat 2's raise is to 125 total, so they put in 125 (32+93). The pot is: SB 16 + BB 32 + Seat 2's 125 = 173. I need to call 109 (125 - my SB 16 already posted). So I'd be putting in 109 to win 173+109=282. That's about 2.6:1 pot odds (109 to win 282).\n\nBut my hand is terrible: 7-3 offsuit, one of the worst possible hands. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising frequently from their position (looking at their actions: raised 121, 61, 101, 101 in recent hands). They seem to be aggressive. But even against a wide range, 7-3o has very low equity.\n\nMy stack is only 4 BB. If I fold, I'll have 112 chips left (3.5 BB). That's critically short. But if I call and lose, I'm out of the tournament. If I call and win, I'd have about 256 chips (8 BB), still short but doubled up.\n\nLet me think about equity. Against a reasonable steal range from Seat 2 (maybe top 40% of hands), 7-3o has about 30% equity. Pot odds of 109 to win 282 means I need 109/(282) = 38.7% equity to break even. 30% is below that. Even against a very wide range (top 60%), 7-3o has maybe 35% equity, still below the required 38.7%.\n\nHowever, there's also the BB (Seat 4) left to act behind me. They have 398 chips. They could call or raise. If they call, the pot gets bigger and my odds improve, but my equity goes down against two players.\n\nActually, wait: Seat 2 is \"Kimi-K2\" but the player list says \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\". That suggests Seat 2 is out of the tournament? But the action says \"Seat 2 raise 125\". That seems contradictory. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\". Yet they raised. Maybe they're actually not out? Or maybe it's a different player? The action shows Seat 2 raised 125. But if they have 0 chips, they can't raise. This might be a display issue.\n\nActually, looking at the player list again: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 0 chips (folded)\" and \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\". So Seat 2 is out. But the action says \"Seat 2 raise 125\". That doesn't make sense. Unless it's a different hand number? Or maybe Seat 2 is actually still in? The action says \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 125\". So they must have chips.\n\nWait, maybe the player list is from before this hand? Or Seat 2 went all-in and is covered? They have 0 chips listed but just raised 125. That suggests they might be all-in for their remaining stack, which is 125 total? But if they have 0 chips, they can't raise. This is confusing.\n\nRegardless, I need to make a decision. With 7-3o and only 4 BB stack, this is a fold. Even with good pot odds, the hand is too weak. I should wait for a better spot. Folding leaves me with 112 chips (3.5 BB), which is very short, but I can look for a better hand to shove with in the next orbit. Calling with 7-3o is just gambling.\n\nAlso, I'm in the small blind, which is a terrible position postflop. Even if I hit something, I'll be out of position.\n\nI should fold. Let me check if there are any other considerations. Looking at my recent wins: I've been winning with raises from various positions. My stack was 128, so I've been doing okay. Folding here preserves some chips for a better hand.\n\nDecision: fold."

            "content": "",
            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the small blind with 7h 3c, a very weak hand. My stack is 128 chips (4 BB). The pot is 173 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 125 total, which is essentially a shove relative to my stack size. I need to call 109 to win 173+109=282? Wait, let's calculate: pot is 173 (including my SB 16 and BB 32, plus Seat 2's 125). Actually, I think Seat 2's raise is to 125 total, so they put in 125 (32+93). The pot is: SB 16 + BB 32 + Seat 2's 125 = 173. I need to call 109 (125 - my SB 16 already posted). So I'd be putting in 109 to win 173+109=282. That's about 2.6:1 pot odds (109 to win 282).\n\nBut my hand is terrible: 7-3 offsuit, one of the worst possible hands. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising frequently from their position (looking at their actions: raised 121, 61, 101, 101 in recent hands). They seem to be aggressive. But even against a wide range, 7-3o has very low equity.\n\nMy stack is only 4 BB. If I fold, I'll have 112 chips left (3.5 BB). That's critically short. But if I call and lose, I'm out of the tournament. If I call and win, I'd have about 256 chips (8 BB), still short but doubled up.\n\nLet me think about equity. Against a reasonable steal range from Seat 2 (maybe top 40% of hands), 7-3o has about 30% equity. Pot odds of 109 to win 282 means I need 109/(282) = 38.7% equity to break even. 30% is below that. Even against a very wide range (top 60%), 7-3o has maybe 35% equity, still below the required 38.7%.\n\nHowever, there's also the BB (Seat 4) left to act behind me. They have 398 chips. They could call or raise. If they call, the pot gets bigger and my odds improve, but my equity goes down against two players.\n\nActually, wait: Seat 2 is \"Kimi-K2\" but the player list says \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\". That suggests Seat 2 is out of the tournament? But the action says \"Seat 2 raise 125\". That seems contradictory. Let me re-read: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\". Yet they raised. Maybe they're actually not out? Or maybe it's a different player? The action shows Seat 2 raised 125. But if they have 0 chips, they can't raise. This might be a display issue.\n\nActually, looking at the player list again: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 0 chips (folded)\" and \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\". So Seat 2 is out. But the action says \"Seat 2 raise 125\". That doesn't make sense. Unless it's a different hand number? Or maybe Seat 2 is actually still in? The action says \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 125\". So they must have chips.\n\nWait, maybe the player list is from before this hand? Or Seat 2 went all-in and is covered? They have 0 chips listed but just raised 125. That suggests they might be all-in for their remaining stack, which is 125 total? But if they have 0 chips, they can't raise. This is confusing.\n\nRegardless, I need to make a decision. With 7-3o and only 4 BB stack, this is a fold. Even with good pot odds, the hand is too weak. I should wait for a better spot. Folding leaves me with 112 chips (3.5 BB), which is very short, but I can look for a better hand to shove with in the next orbit.

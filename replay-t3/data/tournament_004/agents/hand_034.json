            "reasoning_content": "  Now I have information about GPT-OSS-120B. They have been very tight - folding most hands (hands 29-33) and only playing hand 28 where they called preflop but played passively postflop (checking down and folding on river). This suggests they're a conservative player.\n\nWith my hand (AK offsuit) on the button facing a limp from a tight player, I should definitely raise. This is a premium hand in position against a loose call. I want to:\n1. Build the pot with my strong hand\n2. Isolate against this player\n3. Take control of the hand with position\n\nGiven my stack is 81 chips and blinds are 2/4, I have about 20 BB. A standard raise would be 3x the big blind, so 12 chips. Since the minimum raise is 8, I should raise to at least 12, but could go higher. With 20 BB, I could also consider a larger raise to put more pressure.\n\nLet me raise to 12 (3x BB) which is a standard sizing. I want to play this aggressively but not overcommit my stack preflop.\n\nWait, I need to be careful about the raise amount. The minimum raise to is 8, and the amount to call is 0 (since I posted the BB). If I raise to 12, that means I'm putting in 12 total. That seems reasonable.\n\nActually, looking at the context again: Seat 5 posted SB 2, I posted BB 4, then Seat 5 called 2 (to match my BB). So the current bet to me is 0 (I've already posted the BB), but I can raise. A raise to 12 would be standard.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 12,\n  \"reasoning\": \"AK offsuit is a premium hand on the button.

            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** Kh Ac - I have top two pair (Kings and Aces) on a Kd Ah 5c board. This is an extremely strong hand.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position.\n\n**Stack:** I have 73 chips (18.2 BB) - this is a relatively short stack but not desperate yet.\n\n**Pot:** 24 chips\n\n**Board:** Kd Ah 5c - This is a fairly dry board. No flush draw possible (only two clubs), and only potential straight draws would be something like QJ or 34, but those are unlikely given the action.\n\n**Opponent:** GPT-OSS-120B is in the SB position. Looking at their history:\n- They've been very tight, folding preflop many times\n- They called my preflop raise (12 chips) after posting the small blind\n- They checked to me on the flop\n\nThe fact that they called my 3x BB raise preflop suggests they have something. Possible hands:\n- Ax (but not AK since I have both Aces and Kings)\n- Kx (but not AK/KK)\n- Pocket pairs\n- Maybe some suited connectors\n\nWith top two pair on a relatively safe board, I have a very strong hand. I should be value betting here. The opponent checking to me suggests they might have:\n1. A weaker hand they're giving up with\n2. A medium-strength hand they want to see a cheap showdown with\n3. A strong hand trying to trap (less likely given their tight nature)\n\nGiven my shortish stack (18.2 BB), I need to think about maximizing value while also protecting my hand. A check here would be too passive and miss value. \n\nI should make a value bet. The pot is 24, and a standard bet would be 1/2 to 3/4 pot, so 12-18 chips. I need to be careful with my stack size though.\n\nIf I bet 18 (3/4 pot), that leaves me with 55 chips. If I get raised, I might have a tough decision.\n\nIf I bet 12 (1/2 pot), I leave myself with 61 chips and still extract value from weaker hands.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise amount: 8 chips. That's interesting - it seems like the system allows me to raise to 8 total, which is less than the current pot. This might be a \"min-bet\" option.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing:\n- Small bet (8): Might induce calls from weaker hands, but doesn't protect my hand as much\n- Medium bet (12-16): Good value extraction, some protection\n- Larger bet (18+): Maximum value, maximum protection\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have a very strong hand (top two pair)\n2. The board is relatively safe (no obvious draws)\n\n\n3. My opponent is tight and called preflop\n4. I have a shortish stack that needs protection\n5. I want to build the pot for value\n\nI'll go with a medium-sized value bet of 16 chips. This extracts value from weaker hands like Ax, Kx, or pocket pairs, provides decent protection against potential draws, and keeps a reasonable stack size of 57 chips for future streets. The sizing balances extracting value with maintaining some strategic flexibility.\n\nThe opponent's tight preflop call suggests a moderately strong range, making a 16-chip bet an optimal strategy to capitalize on their potential holdings while managing my stack effectively.",

Also his raise size is small (3x). Calling 8 is cheap. Could also raise to isolate? Raise to 20 minimum. If we raise to 20, we would be 20 total, which is 5x BB. That might isolate and we could have position preflop? Actually after raise, we would be the raiser, and then seat1 would have to act again. He may call or re-raise (unlikely). But raising might be good to get value if he has a hand like A2, K2, etc. But 7T suited is not strong enough to re-raise for value. Likely best to call and see flop. Also note his stack is short; if we call, we will have a big effective stack relative to him. He may go all-in later. But we can call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nWe need JSON.",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with 7h Ts. Board: Kd Ah 5c. Opponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, 57 chips left (short stack). He raised preflop to 12 (from 4 to 12? Actually raise to 12 total, meaning he put in 12, you called 8). So pot after preflop: 2 (SB) +4 (BB) +8 call +12 raise = 26? Wait compute: SB 2, BB 4 posted, then you call 2 (makes 4 total), seat1 raise to 12 (so adds 8 more), you call 8 (makes your total 12). So total pot = 2+4+12+12 = 30? Actually each contributed: SB 2, BB 4+8 =12, seat1 12. Sum = 2+12+12 =26? Let's recount: Preflop actions: SB (seat5) posts 2, BB (seat1) posts 4, seat2 fold, seat3 fold, seat4 fold, seat5 call 2 (so adds 2 more to make 4 total), seat1 raise 12 (so puts total 12, meaning additional 8), seat5 call 8 (adds 8 to make total 12). So contributions: seat5 total 12, seat1 total 12, plus SB 2? Wait SB is seat5, already accounted. The BB is seat1? Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, but position says \"Your Position: BB (Seat5)\". So seat1 is UTG? Actually seat1 posted BB 4, so seat1 is BB? But they said your position BB seat5. So seat1 posted BB? The description seems contradictory. However we treat seat1 as opponent who posted BB 4 then raised. So pot after preflop: seat5 (you) contributed 12, seat1 contributed 12, plus small blind? Actually small blind is you (seat5) posted 2, then called 2 to match big blind 4? Wait typical: SB 2, BB 4. You are BB, you posted 4. Then you also posted SB 2? No you can't be both. Something off. But pot given is 40 chips on flop. So pot 40 includes contributions. We'll trust pot 40.\n\nNow flop: Kd Ah 5c. You have 7h Ts, which gives you a gutshot straight draw (needs 9 for 9-T-J-Q-K? Actually board: K A 5, you have T,7. You have open-ended? Not. Straight possibilities: 9-10-J? Board has A,K,5. With T you have Broadway draw? Need Q J 9? Not. Actually you have Ten, board has Ace and King, you have gutshot to a straight with 9? Ten with Ace high no straight. So only draw is a gutshot to a straight with 9 (9-10-J-Q-K) but you need J and Q and 9, not likely. Also you have backdoor flush draw? You have hearts 7h, board has hearts? No hearts on board. So no flush draw.\n\nYour hand is basically overcards (A,K on board). You have Ten, which is lower than both. So you have basically nothing, likely losing. Opponent bet 16 into pot 40 (pot after flop before bet is 40). So bet size 16 is about 0.4 pot. You have 363 chips stack. Opponent short stack 57 chips left (including his bet?). He bet 16, so his remaining stack after bet is 57-16=41. So he is short. He may be betting as a value bet with Ace high? He might have A-K, A-x, etc. Could be a bluff? But short stack may be trying to steal or push.\n\nYour hand is weak. Likely fold. But consider pot odds: you need to call 16 to win 40+16=56 pot? Actually after call, pot would be 40+16+16=72. So you need to call 16 to win 72, odds 16/72 = 22%. Your hand's equity is likely far less than 22% (maybe 10% max). So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nWe need to output JSON.\n\n",

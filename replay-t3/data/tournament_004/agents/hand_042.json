The opponent is tight, the raise size is significant, my hand is weak, and calling would cripple my stack. I should preserve my chips for a better spot, preferably all-in situation where I have fold equity.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern to when this opponent raises...",

The pot is 60 chips after: SB 4, BB 8, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 24, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called.\n\nI need to call 20 chips to stay in. The pot odds: pot is 60, I need to call 20, so 60:20 or 3:1 pot odds. I need about 25% equity to call.\n\nMy hand is K4 suited. It's not a great hand, but it's suited with a king. However, I'm out of position (SB) and will have to act first on every street. There's already a raiser and a caller, so the pot is multi-way.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Has raised once (hand 40) and folded many times. Seems tight.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has raised a couple times, showed down with AJ and AK.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB): Has folded a lot, raised once big (hand 39).\n\nMy stack is 119, which is 14.9 BB - relatively short. The raiser has 327 chips (big stack), caller has 221 chips.\n\nIf I call 20, I'll have 99 chips left (12.4 BB). The pot will be 80 chips. That's committing 17% of my stack preflop with a marginal hand out of position.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and stack size, this is a fold. K4s is not strong enough to call a raise and a call from out of position with a short stack. Even with pot odds, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position against likely stronger ranges. Better to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nAlso, I have similar hand history: hand #37 I had K4o (Ks4c) in SB and folded. That was correct then, and it's correct now.\n\nFold."

The pot is 60 chips after: SB 4, BB 8, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 24, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called.\n\nI need to call 20 chips to stay in. The pot odds: pot is 60, I need to call 20, so 60:20 or 3:1 pot odds. I need about 25% equity to call.\n\nMy hand is K4 suited. It's not a great hand, but it's suited with a king. However, I'm out of position (SB) and will have to act first on every street. There's already a raiser and a caller, so the pot is multi-way.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Has raised once (hand 40) and folded many times. Seems tight.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has raised a couple times, showed down with AJ and AK.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB): Has folded a lot, raised once big (hand 39).\n\nMy stack is 119, which is 14.9 BB - relatively short. The raiser has 327 chips (big stack), caller has 221 chips.\n\nIf I call 20, I'll have 99 chips left (12.4 BB). The pot will be 80 chips. That's committing 17% of my stack preflop with a marginal hand out of position.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and stack size, this is a fold. K4s is not strong enough to call a raise and a call from out of position with a short stack. Even with pot odds, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position against likely stronger ranges. Better to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nAlso, I have similar hand history: hand #37 I had K4o (Ks4c) in SB and folded. That was correct then, and it's correct now.\n\nFold.",

Their raises seem relatively small (minimum or near minimum).\n\nKimi-K2 (seat 2) has called multiple streets in hands 3 and 19. They showed AJ in hand 3 and AK in hand 19. So they call with strong hands.\n\nThe current raise from seat 5 is to 24 chips (3x BB). This is larger than their previous raises (8, 12, 8). Seat 2 called with 221 chips stack.\n\nI'm in SB with K4s. My stack is 119 (14.9 BB). Calling 20 chips would leave me with 99 (12.4 BB). Pot odds: 60 pot, 20 to call = 3:1, need 25% equity.\n\nK4s against a raising range (likely AJ+, KQ, maybe suited connectors) and a calling range (seat 2 called with AJ and AK before) has maybe 30-35% equity multi-way. But I'm out of position, which reduces my equity realization significantly.\n\nWith a short stack, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call out of position. However, I only have 14.9 BB, so I'm getting into push/fold territory. K4s is not a good shoving hand here with a raiser and caller already in.\n\nIf I fold, I have 115 chips (14.4 BB). Still playable.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. I'm out of position, hand is marginal, and there's already action. The pot odds are tempting but position matters a lot.\n\nFold.",

Hand is suited broadway, decent but not premium. Stack is decent. Opponents: seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised previously? Actually actions: seat3 posted small blind 4, seat4 posted big blind 8. So we are first to act after blinds? UTG is seat5, after SB and BB, action goes to UTG first. So amount to call is 8 (big blind). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek raises often preflop with amounts 12,16,18,32. That's about 1.5-4 BB raises (big blind 8). So they raise larger sometimes. They are seat3 (SB) but not relevant now. MiniMax seat4 is BB, hasn't acted yet. We are UTG. Should we open raise? Standard UTG open range is tight: maybe top 10%: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ. KJ suited is borderline, often not opened UTG in tournament early stages, especially with 44 BB stack? Might be okay to limp? But limp (call) is not recommended in early position; better to fold or raise. Since we have 44 BB, we could raise to 3-4 BB (24-32). Minimum raise is 16 (2 BB). Could raise to 24 (3 BB). That would be standard.\n\nBut consider stack depth: 44 BB, we could open for 3 BB to build pot. Opponents may call or re-raise. Our hand has good equity vs many hands, especially suited. Could also consider 3-bet if someone raises, but no raise yet.\n\nThus decision: raise to 24 (3 BB). Reason: decent hand, position early, want to thin field, build pot, have enough stack.\n\nCheck if any reason to fold: KJs is not premium UTG but still playable. In tournament early, we might be cautious. But with 44 BB, we can afford to open.\n\nThus action: raise to 24.",

So we are first to act on flop (since we are BB, but preflop we raised, now flop we act first). Board: 9s 3d 8h. Our hand: Ks Js. So we have open-ended straight draw (7-10). Actually we have gutshot? Let's see: board 9,3,8. We have K,J. Straight possibilities: 7-8-9-10-J gives us gutshot? Actually we have J, board has 9 and 8, missing 10 for open-ended? We have J, need 10 for straight J-10-9-8-7? Wait need 7-8-9-10-J. We have J, board 8,9, need 7 and 10. That's two outs for open-ended? Actually we have two ways: need 7 or 10. So we have 8 outs (four 7s and four 10s) = 8 outs. That's decent.\n\nWe also have backdoor flush draws? Suits: board spade 9s, hearts 8h, diamonds 3d. Our hand: Ks (spade), Js (spade). So we have two spades, board has one spade, so we have a flush draw with 2 spades in hand, need two more spades on turn and river. That's 9 outs (remaining spades = 11? Actually there are 13 spades total, we have 2, board has 1, so 10 left. But two needed, probability lower). So decent equity.\n\nPot is 60, we have 327 stack. Opponent stack 221. No bet yet on flop. We can check or bet/raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise (minimum raise to 16). Since we are first to act, we can bet (raise). Should we bet? With open-ended straight draw and flush draw, we have decent equity, but we also have backdoor possibilities. Opponent may have made a pair (9,8,3) etc. We could bet to protect and build pot. Our stack is decent relative to pot. Minimum raise 16, which is 2.5BB? Actually blind 4/8, raise to 24 preflop, pot 60 includes our raise (24+24+8?). Let's compute: preflop: SB 4, BB 8, we raise to 24, opponent calls 24. So pot after preflop = 4+8+24+24 = 60. Yes.\n\nNow flop: we can bet 16 (to 76 total). That is about 1/3 pot. That could be a continuation bet. Our hand has good draw, we want to see cheap turn. Betting also protects against draws. Opponent may call with any pair, or raise with strong. We have decent stack, can call raise.\n\nGiven tournament stage (we have 40 BB, opponent 27.6 BB). We want to preserve chips but also accumulate. I think a continuation bet of 16 is good.\n\nThus action: raise to 76? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raise to 16 means total bet of 16? Minimum raise to 16 means we need to put 16 chips total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in, not additional. Since no bet, raise to 16 means we bet 16 chips. But is that allowed? Minimum raise to 16, so we can raise to 16. That would be a small bet ~0.27 pot. Might be too small. But we can raise more, up to any amount. Maybe raise to 30? Let's choose raise to 30 (approx half pot). That is a decent continuation bet.\n\nCheck? Could also check to see opponent's action, but we have strong draw, we want to get value if opponent has pair. But also risk of giving free cards. I think bet.\n\nThus output: raise to 30.\n\nReasoning: open-ended straight draw, flush draw, want to build pot, protect, etc.\n\n"

So we are first to act on flop (since we are BB, but preflop we raised, now flop we act first). Board: 9s 3d 8h. Our hand: Ks Js. So we have open-ended straight draw (7-10). Actually we have gutshot? Let's see: board 9,3,8. We have K,J. Straight possibilities: 7-8-9-10-J gives us gutshot? Actually we have J, board has 9 and 8, missing 10 for open-ended? We have J, need 10 for straight J-10-9-8-7? Wait need 7-8-9-10-J. We have J, board 8,9, need 7 and 10. That's two outs for open-ended? Actually we have two ways: need 7 or 10. So we have 8 outs (four 7s and four 10s) = 8 outs. That's decent.\n\nWe also have backdoor flush draws? Suits: board spade 9s, hearts 8h, diamonds 3d. Our hand: Ks (spade), Js (spade). So we have two spades, board has one spade, so we have a flush draw with 2 spades in hand, need two more spades on turn and river. That's 9 outs (remaining spades = 11? Actually there are 13 spades total, we have 2, board has 1, so 10 left. But two needed, probability lower). So decent equity.\n\nPot is 60, we have 327 stack. Opponent stack 221. No bet yet on flop. We can check or bet/raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise (minimum raise to 16). Since we are first to act, we can bet (raise). Should we bet? With open-ended straight draw and flush draw, we have decent equity, but we also have backdoor possibilities. Opponent may have made a pair (9,8,3) etc. We could bet to protect and build pot. Our stack is decent relative to pot. Minimum raise 16, which is 2.5BB? Actually blind 4/8, raise to 24 preflop, pot 60 includes our raise (24+24+8?). Let's compute: preflop: SB 4, BB 8, we raise to 24, opponent calls 24. So pot after preflop = 4+8+24+24 = 60. Yes.\n\nNow flop: we can bet 16 (to 76 total). That is about 1/3 pot. That could be a continuation bet. Our hand has good draw, we want to see cheap turn. Betting also protects against draws. Opponent may call with any pair, or raise with strong. We have decent stack, can call raise.\n\nGiven tournament stage (we have 40 BB, opponent 27.6 BB). We want to preserve chips but also accumulate. I think a continuation bet of 16 is good.\n\nThus action: raise to 76? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raise to 16 means total bet of 16? Minimum raise to 16 means we need to put 16 chips total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in, not additional. Since no bet, raise to 16 means we bet 16 chips. But is that allowed? Minimum raise to 16, so we can raise to 16. That would be a small bet ~0.27 pot. Might be too small. But we can raise more, up to any amount. Maybe raise to 30? Let's choose raise to 30 (approx half pot). That is a decent continuation bet.\n\nCheck? Could also check to see opponent's action, but we have strong draw, we want to get value if opponent has pair. But also risk of giving free cards. I think bet.\n\nThus output: raise to 30.\n\nReasoning: open-ended straight draw, flush draw, want to build pot, protect, etc.\n\n",

Actually board spades: 9s, 5s. Our spades: K\u2660, J\u2660. So we have 4 spades total, need one more spade on river to make flush. Straight draw? We have KJ, board 9-8-5-3. If a 7 appears, we get 5-7-8-9? Actually need 7 for 5-6-7-8-9? Not. Straight possibilities: 7 would give 5-6-7-8-9? No 6 missing. 6 would give 5-6-7-8-9? No 7 missing. So no straight draw. So currently we have high cards, K high, J kicker. Opponent seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has called preflop and flop. Pot is 120. Turn action: we are in BB, we acted preflop raise, flop bet, opponent called. Now turn: amount to call 0, so we are first to act? Actually after flop, opponent called, now turn action: it's our turn? Since we are seat 5 (BB) and opponent seat 2 is after us? The order: seat 5 (us) raised preflop, seat 2 called, flop bet by us, seat 2 called, now turn. So it's our turn to act first (since we were first to bet flop). So we have option to check or raise. Opponent's stack 191, ours 297. Opponent's tendencies unknown. Should we bet? We have no made hand, only potential flush draw. Might be a good spot to bluff? Turn board: 9s 3d 8h 5s. It's a relatively dry board, no pairs on board, no straight possibilities. Opponent likely has a hand like 9x, 8x, 5x, maybe a pair. Could be a weak hand. We could attempt a continuation bet (c-bet) to take pot. Our raise would be minimum raise to 30 (i.e., raise to 30 total? Actually minimum raise to 30 means raise amount total 30? The legal raise amount: currently amount to call 0, so we can bet 30 (minimum raise). So we could bet 30. That would be 30 into 120 pot, about 1/4 pot. That seems small. Might be okay as a probe. But we could also check and see river. Considering tournament, we have decent stack 37 BB, not short. Might want to preserve chips. Opponent may have called flop with a marginal hand, but we could try to take pot now. The opponent's previous actions: they called our flop bet, indicating maybe they have a hand that likes board (maybe a 9, 8, 5, or a gutshot). Could be a pair of 9s? But board no pair. Could be a straight draw like 7-6? Actually board 9-8-5-3, 7-6 would give 5-6-7-8-9, yes that is a straight! Wait we have 5-8-9, missing 6 and 7. So 7-6 would give straight. So opponent could have 7-6. They called flop bet with that draw? Possibly. So they might have a draw. Our raise may push them out. But we also have a flush draw, but not strong. Might consider check to see river card. River could be spade for flush, or 7/6 for straight. But we don't have any pair, so maybe check.\n\nGiven the situation, likely best to check, see river, then decide. The pot is 120, we have 297 left. Checking is safe.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nWe need JSON with raise_to null.\n\n",

We have J, need 10 and Q? Actually straight combos: 7-8-9-10-J (need 7 and 10). We have J, no 7 or 10. 8-9-10-J-Q (need 10 and Q). We have J, need 10 and Q. 5-6-7-8-9 (need 6 and 7). Not. So no immediate draw. We have two overcards K and J to board. No pair. So currently we have high cards, likely losing.\n\nOpponent seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 131 chips, bet 60 on turn after we checked. Their preflop call and flop call. They have a stack 131, we have 297. Pot before turn bet: after flop bet 30 each, pot = preflop 24+24 + flop 30+30 = 132? Actually preflop: we raised 24, opponent called 24, plus blinds 4+8 = 12, so pot after preflop = 24+24+12=60. Flop bet 30 each => add 60, pot = 120. Turn check, opponent bets 60, so pot now 180 (as given). So they bet 60 into 120 pot, about half pot.\n\nOur hand is weak. Should we fold? Likely yes. But consider opponent tendencies: from recall, they often raise preflop small 12 (maybe 1.5 BB). They have been folding often. In hand 35 they bet 16 on flop (small). In hand 35 they had maybe some hand. Not much aggression. Here they bet 60 on turn after checking earlier. Could be they have a made hand like 9x, 8x, 5x, pair, or a draw.\n\nWe have only 297 chips, can afford to fold. No need to risk.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

Let me analyze the hand first:\n\nPosition: BB (big blind)\nCards: 8c 7c (suited connector)\nStack: 212 chips (deep stack)\nPot: 7 chips\nAction: Seat 4 raised to 4 (2 more to call)\n\nI have to call 2 chips to see the flop with 8c 7c. This is a suited connector. Let me think about this:\n\n1. Hand strength: 8c 7c is a suited connector. It has potential to make straights and flushes, but is weak against a raise.\n2. Position: I'm in the BB, so I'll be out of position post-flop.\n3. Pot odds: I need to call 2 to win 7, so 2:7 or about 28.5% pot odds.\n4. Stack sizes: I have a deep stack (212), as does Seat 4 (176).\n5. The raise size is small (just 2 more chips, which is a min-raise).\n\nWith suited connectors, I generally want to see flops cheaply, especially when I'm getting good pot odds. Here I'm getting 3.5:1 pot odds, which is decent. However, I'll be out of position which makes it harder to realize my equity.\n\nBut wait, I should use the tools to gather information about opponents first before making my decision. Let me recall what I know about Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2).\n\nActually, I need to respond with a JSON action. Let me think more carefully:\n\n- 8c 7c suited is a marginal hand against a raise\n- I'm out of position (BB)\n- Pot odds are good (3.5:1)\n- The raise is small (min-raise)\n- I have a deep stack, so I can afford to see flops with speculative hands\n\nI think calling is reasonable here given the small raise size and good pot odds. Folding is also defensible since I'm out of position with a weak hand. Raising would be too aggressive with this hand.\n\nLet me make a decision: I'll call. The pot odds are good, it's a small raise, and suited connectors can hit big hands. Being out of position is a concern, but the price is right.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Getting 3.5:1 pot odds with a suited connector.

The board shows Ad Jd 2d - there's a flush draw with three diamonds, and two high cards (Ace and Jack). My hand is completely missed:\n- No pair\n- No flush draw (I have clubs)\n- Straight draw would be 8-9-T-J-Q, but I only have 8-7 and there's no 9 or T on board\n- Basically, I have absolutely nothing\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- Very tight player - has folded preflop in most hands (hands 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13)\n- When they do enter (hands 2 and 3), they called preflop, checked flop, then folded to action\n- In this hand, they raised preflop to 4 (which is unusual for them)\n- This suggests they likely have a strong hand\n\n**Current situation:**\n- MiniMax-M2 raised preflop (unusual for this tight player)\n- I called from BB with my suited connectors\n- Flop is Ad Jd 2d\n- It's on me to act, and I can check\n\nGiven:\n1. I have absolutely nothing (8-high)\n2. The board is very coordinated with a flush draw and high cards\n3. My opponent is tight and raised preflop (suggesting strength)\n4. I have no draw and no showdown value\n5. Pot is small (9 chips)\n\nThe clear action here is to check and hope to see a free card, but I should be prepared to fold to any significant bet. \n\nSince I have the option to check for free, I should take it. Checking costs nothing and gives me a chance to see if I improve on the turn (though it's very unlikely with 8-high). If my opponent bets, I'll almost certainly need to fold.\n\nI should NOT raise here because:\n- I have no hand and no draw\n- Raising would be pure bluff against a tight player who showed strength preflop\n- The board heavily favors the preflop raiser's range (Ax, Kx, broadway cards)\n- Risking chips with 8-high on an Ace-high board with a flush draw is terrible\n- I have a comfortable stack and no need to make desperate plays\n\nThe correct play is to check.",

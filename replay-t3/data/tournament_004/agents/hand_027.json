Pocket tens is a strong hand that plays well against a wide range. From UTG, I should be raising with this hand to:\n1. Build the pot with a strong hand\n2. Isolate against fewer opponents (tens don't like multi-way pots)\n3. Potentially win the blinds and antes\n4. Set up for a potential all-in on favorable flops\n\n**Action decision:**\nGiven my short stack and strong hand, I should raise. The minimum raise is to 8 (4 more chips). However, with 18.8 BB, I might want to raise larger to:\n- Put pressure on the blinds\n- Set up a favorable stack-to-pot ratio for later streets\n- Avoid giving good odds to speculative hands\n\nA standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 12 chips. This would be 3 BB total, which is 8 more than the current call amount.\n\nLet me raise to 12 chips total.",

K7 offsuit is not a good starting hand, especially from the small blind.\n- Position: SB (worst position postflop)\n- Stack: 119 chips (29.8 BB) - healthy but not huge\n- Opponent: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 12 (3x BB)\n- Amount to call: 10 chips\n- Pot: 18 chips currently\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall_opponent_actions, I see:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding a lot recently (folded hands 20-26 consecutively)\n- In hand #21, they raised preflop to 12 then folded (likely 3-bet or faced re-raise)\n- In hand #19, they bet turn and river with Th Ac (showing some aggression)\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot after call would be 28 chips (18 current + my 10)\n- Need to call 10 to win 28 = ~35.7% pot odds\n- K7o vs a typical raising range has maybe 30-35% equity at best\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 29.8 BB, which is decent but not huge\n- Calling from SB with K7o is generally bad due to positional disadvantage\n- The BB (Seat 4) still to act behind me with 185 chips\n\n**Decision:**\nK7o from SB is a fold. The hand is weak, position is terrible, and pot odds don't justify calling. Even if the opponent has been folding a lot, they've shown a raise here which likely indicates a decent hand. The BB could also squeeze behind me. Better to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K7o from SB is a weak hand with terrible position.

This confirms that Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has been very tight, folding in 9 out of their last 10 hands preflop. When they did raise (hand #21), they folded afterward, which suggests they might have been bluffing or got scared postflop.\n\nGiven this tight pattern and the fact that they're now raising with only 63 chips (15.75 BB), this could indicate either:\n1. They have a strong hand and are trying to build the pot\n2. They're making a desperate move with a short stack\n\nEither way, with my 2h 5c, I have very little equity and would be playing out of position. The pot odds of 8 chips to win 18 chips (44%) might seem attractive, but with such a weak hand, the actual equity I'm getting is much lower once I consider the likely strength of my opponent's raising range.\n\nI should stick with my fold decision. My 2-5 offsuit has very little playability postflop, and calling would put me in difficult spots where I'd likely have to fold to any aggression, essentially wasting 8 chips with minimal chance of winning.\n",

Our hand is not strong enough to call or raise. Call would be just 1 chip to see flop, but with Q7 offsuit it's marginal. Could fold. But also could limp (call) and see flop cheap, but risk being out of position postflop (SB is in position). However calling 1 is cheap. In tournament, preserve chips, but also not lose many chips. Folding loses only 2 blind (already posted). Actually we have posted 2 BB, but we could fold now and lose those 2 (already in pot). If we call 1, we invest extra 1 chip to see flop; could win pot of maybe 3+1=4? Actually pot would be 3 (blinds) + call 1 = 4. So we invest 1 chip to potentially win 4, pot odds 4:1 (25%).

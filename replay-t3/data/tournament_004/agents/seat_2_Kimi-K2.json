Checking gives me a free showdown, but I might be leaving value on the table if I have the best hand.\n\n**Decision**: With Ace-high, I likely have the best hand here given the opponent's river check after aggressive betting.

They've folded to raises before.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 1 chip to win a 5-chip pot, getting 5:1 odds which is excellent.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With a medium stack, I should look for spots to accumulate chips without risking my tournament life unnecessarily.\n\nGiven the excellent pot odds and decent hand strength, I should definitely play this hand. With position disadvantage, I should raise to try to take control of the hand and potentially win it preflop or on the flop with a continuation bet.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A9s is a strong hand against a single limper.

They 3-bet preflop and now checked to me on the flop.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nI have absolutely nothing - just 8-high with no draws.

This suggests they likely have a marginal hand or are trapping with a strong hand. The fact they 3-bet preflop then checked twice indicates they might have AK/AQ type hands that missed, or a medium pair.\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have a strong draw with 8 outs to a straight\n2. **Stack Sizes**: I'm pot-committed with only 193 chips left in a 546 chip pot\n3. **Position**: I'm in position on the button\n4. **Pot Odds**: If I shove 193 into 546, I'm getting called and need ~26% equity to break even\n5. **Tournament Situation**: I'm very short-stacked and need to make moves\n\nSince my opponent checked the turn and I have a strong draw with good pot odds, I should take the free card and see if I can hit my straight on the river. Shoving here would likely get called by better hands, but checking gives me a free chance to improve.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have an open-ended straight draw with 8 outs.

With 0.5 BB left, I need to preserve my tournament life for a better spot. Even getting 3:1 pot odds, 6-high offsuit has virtually no showdown value and poor playability postflop.

They've folded to raises before.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 1 chip to win a 5-chip pot, getting 5:1 odds which is excellent.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With a medium stack, I should look for spots to accumulate chips without risking my tournament life unnecessarily.\n\nGiven the excellent pot odds and decent hand strength, I should definitely play this hand.

GPT-OSS-120B bet into two players on this Ace-high board, suggesting they likely have an Ace or better\n2. My hand has very limited equity - just a king-high card with no draws\n3. From their action history, GPT-OSS-120B has been betting flops frequently\n4. I'm getting pot odds of 3:1, but with K-high I likely have very little equity against their range\n5. My stack is short at 6.8 BB, so preserving chips is important\n\nWith no pair, no draw, and facing aggression on an Ace-high board, this is a clear fold.

They 3-bet preflop and now checked to me on the flop.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nI have absolutely nothing - just 8-high with no draws. Even if I hit an 8 or J, those are marginal holdings on this board texture.\n\n**Stack Dynamics:**\n- I have 193 chips (6 BB)\n- Opponent only has 32 chips left\n- Pot is already 546 chips\n\n**Decision:**\nWith no hand and no draws, checking back is the only reasonable play here. Betting would accomplish nothing - they'd likely shove their short stack with any piece of the board, and I'd have to fold. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to potentially improve on later streets or get to showdown cheaply.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"No hand, no draws, and opponent is short-stacked.

Even with 3:1 pot odds, 3-4 offsuit has very poor equity against any reasonable big blind range.\n\nThe correct play is to fold and hope for a better spot in the next hands, as I still have some fold equity if I shove first in later hands.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"With only 0.5 BB left and 3-4 offsuit, this is an easy fold.

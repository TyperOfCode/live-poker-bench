This player is extremely tight and likely to fold to any pressure.\n\nMy stack is 13.2 BB, which is in push-or-fold territory. With 45o, this is a marginal hand. However, I'm on the button with two players left:\n1. SB (MiniMax-M2) - 386 chips (24.1 BB) - capable of aggression\n2. BB (GPT-OSS-120B) - 102 chips (6.4 BB) - has folded 10 straight times preflop\n\nThe BB is extremely short (6.4 BB) and has shown extreme tightness. The SB has a bigger stack but might not want to risk chips with marginal hands.\n\nGiven my position and stack size, this is a good spot to steal the blinds. The BB is likely to fold given their history, and the SB might fold many hands. Even if called, 45o has some playability postflop.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 16 to win 24, which is 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed. Against random hands, 45o has about 40% equity. But we're not calling - we're considering raising.\n\nIf I raise to 32 (minimum), I'm risking 32 to win 24, which needs to work about 57% of the time. If I go all-in (212), I'm risking 212 to win 24, which needs to work about 90% of the time.\n\nGiven the BB's extreme tightness and short stack, a small raise might work. But the SB might call or re-raise. With my short stack, going all-in might be better to maximize fold equity.\n\nActually, with 13.2 BB, standard tournament strategy suggests shoving with a wide range on the button. 45o is definitely in that shoving range.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. My recent hands show I won a big pot with KK (hand 63), so I have some chips but still short. The BB is even shorter and folding constantly.\n\nI think an all-in shove is the best play here. It puts maximum pressure on both players. The BB with 6.4 BB is unlikely to call with anything but premium hands given their tightness. The SB might call with a decent range, but 45o has decent equity against many calling ranges.\n\nIf I just call or min-raise, I give the SB and BB good odds to call and play postflop, which is bad with my weak hand.\n\nDecision: All-in (212 chips).",

            "reasoning_content": "We have BB with Kd4h, stack 102 chips, but blinds are 8/16, pot currently 236? Wait: blinds posted: SB 8 (seat4), BB 16 (seat5). Then seat3 raise 212 (likely from UTG? Actually seat3 is out but raise 212). That raise is 212 total? Usually raise amount includes call? The raise of 212 likely means they put 212 chips total (i.e., they raised to 212). Since BB posted 16, they need to call 212-16 = 196 to match. The pot after raise: 8+16+212 = 236 (makes sense). So we have to call 196 to stay, but our stack is 102 chips total, we cannot call 196. Actually our stack is 102 chips, but we already posted 16 blind, leaving 86 remaining. So we cannot call full amount; we can go all-in for remaining 86. However legal actions only list fold, call. The system maybe doesn't allow raise because min raise is 408 which we cannot meet. But we could go all-in as a call? In poker, you can call all-in for less than amount to call; it's considered a call (or a call for less). So we can \"call\" which will be all-in for remaining 86. The action \"call\" will be accepted and we will be all-in.\n\nWe need to decide: hand Kd4h is weak, not a good candidate to call an all-in, especially short stack. Our stack is short relative to raise; we are effectively forced all-in for 86. The opponent raised to 212 from 239 chips stack (they have 239). They likely have a strong hand. So we should fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

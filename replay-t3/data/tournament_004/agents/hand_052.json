            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 8h 2s - This is an extremely weak hand, often called the \"worst hand in poker\" or the \"computer hand.\" It's unsuited, has a big gap, and both cards are low.\n\n2. **My position**: CO (Cutoff) - This is a good position, but it doesn't matter much with this hand.\n\n3. **My stack**: 53 chips (6.6 BB) - I'm very short-stacked. This is a critical tournament situation where I need to preserve my chips for better spots.\n\n4. **The action**: \n   - SB posted 4\n   - BB posted 8\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 24 (3x the BB)\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 24 to win 36, which is 24:36 or 1:1.5. This means I need 40% equity to break even on a call.\n\n6. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n   - Hand 48: Checked preflop, folded on flop\n   - Hand 49: Called preflop, called flop bet, checked turn and river, folded river\n   - Hand 50: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 51: Folded preflop\n   \n   This opponent seems to be playing somewhat tight, folding preflop several times. The raise to 24 suggests they likely have a decent hand.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With only 6.6 BB, I need to be extremely selective. This is a clear fold situation. I should wait for a much better hand or position to get my chips in.\n\n8. **Hand equity**: 82o has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against random hands, it performs poorly.\n\n**Decision**: This is an easy fold. I have a terrible hand, I'm facing a raise from a player who appears to be selective, and I have a short stack that I need to preserve for a better opportunity.",

GPT-OSS-120B: Has been folding a lot recently (folds in hands 50, 51). Hasn't shown any preflop raises in the limited history I can see. This might be their first raise.\n2. MiniMax-M2: Has shown some aggression with raises preflop (hand 47 raised to 40, hand 49 raised to 16). Currently in BB with 259 chips.\n\n**Pot odds:** Need to call 20 to win 56 (36 pot + 20 call). That's ~35.7% pot odds.\n\n**Hand analysis:** A7s is a marginal hand. It's suited with an ace, which gives some flush potential, but the 7 kicker is weak. Against a raise from early position, this hand is likely dominated.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With only 13.4 BB, I'm in push-or-fold territory. However, I have position on the raiser (BTN vs seat 5), and the BB still to act.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Conservative play. Preserve my short stack for better spots.\n2. **Call:** Risky. Commits ~19% of my stack preflop with a marginal hand out of position post-flop.\n3. **Raise:** Could shove all-in (107 total). Would put pressure on the raiser and possibly get folds.\n\nGiven my stack size (13.4 BB), A7s might be a shoving hand from the button against a single raiser, especially if the raiser is tight. However, I need to consider:\n- The raiser (GPT-OSS-120B) has been folding recently, so their raise might indicate strength.\n- I have the BB (MiniMax-M2) still to act behind me, who has shown aggression.\n- If I call, I'll have ~11 BB left post-flop, which commits me to the hand.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: if I call 20, I'll have 87 left in a pot of 76 (36+20+20). That's a pot of ~1.1x my remaining stack, so I'll be pot-committed on most flops.\n\nGiven this, I should either fold or shove. A7s is borderline for a shove from the button. With my short stack, I need to accumulate chips soon. The raiser's recent folding pattern suggests they might fold to a shove, but their raise also suggests strength.\n\nLet me check if there are any observations about all-in situations or shoves."

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze the current hand situation. I'm on the flop with 7c Ac, board is 7h Qd 8c. My stack is only 4 chips (0.5 BB), which is incredibly short. I have bottom pair with ace kicker, but the board has a queen and an 8. The pot is 222 chips, and I have only 4 chips left. My opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) has 150 chips.\n\nLooking at the action: preflop, I posted SB 4, BB was 8, seat 5 raised to 24, I raised to 107 (which was likely all-in given my stack), seat 5 called. So I'm essentially all-in preflop with A7s. The flop gave me bottom pair.\n\nSince I'm already all-in (my stack is 4 chips, but I raised to 107 preflop, which means I'm all-in for my remaining stack), the action is now on the flop but I have no chips left to bet. The amount to call is 0, so I should check. But wait, I need to understand: if I'm all-in, there might not be any action for me. However, the interface shows \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check\". Since I'm all-in, I can't fold - that would be absurd. I should check.\n\nBut let me think: I'm effectively all-in preflop. The flop is being dealt, and since I'm all-in, there's no further betting for me. I should check to proceed to the turn and river. Actually, in poker when a player is all-in, the betting continues among players who still have chips. But in this case, I have 4 chips left? Wait, my stack is 4 chips. I posted SB 4, then raised to 107. That means I put in 103 more chips (107 total - 4 SB = 103). But I only have 4 chips total? That doesn't make sense. Let me recalculate: My stack is 4 chips. I posted SB 4, so I had 0 left. Then I raised to 107? That would require 103 more chips which I don't have. This suggests I'm actually all-in for my 4 chips. The raise to 107 might be a display issue or I'm misunderstanding.\n\nActually, looking at the action: \"preflop: Seat 3 raise 107\". That means I raised to a total of 107 chips. But I only have 4 chips total. So I must be all-in. The pot is 222 chips, which seems large. Let me calculate: SB 4 + BB 8 + raise to 24 + my all-in 4 + call? Hmm.\n\nRegardless, I have bottom pair with ace kicker. My opponent called my all-in preflop. They could have a wide range since they called from the big blind position after a raise. The flop is 7h Qd 8c. I have a pair of 7s. My opponent could have many hands: maybe a queen, maybe a pocket pair, maybe a draw.\n\nGiven I'm all-in, I have no decision to make except to check (or technically, since I'm all-in, the action should automatically check for me). But the interface gives me \"check\" as an option.\n\nI should check to see the turn and river. There's no reason to fold when I'm all-in and have a pair.\n\nLet me check opponent's tendencies from the recall data: They seem to play somewhat passively - checking and calling often, folding sometimes. They called my all-in preflop, so they likely have a decent hand.\n\nBut ultimately, I have no decision here - I'm all-in. I should check.",

But the action shows: preflop Seat 3 (me) raise 107. That can't be right if I only have 4 chips. Maybe there's a mistake in the display? Let me trace through:\n\n- I have 4 chips\n- I post SB 4 (all-in)\n- BB posts 8\n- Seat 5 raises to 24\n- I raise to 107 (impossible with 4 chips)\n- Seat 5 calls 83\n\nThis doesn't make sense. Unless my stack is actually larger? Wait, maybe the \"Your Stack: 4 chips (0.5 BB)\" is wrong, or maybe I started with more and the raise was legitimate.\n\nLet me check the pot: 222 chips. That's substantial. If I only had 4 chips, the pot couldn't be 222. Let me calculate:\n\nSB: 4, BB: 8, Seat 5 raise to 24 (adds 16 more), then I raise to 107 (adds 83 more), then Seat 5 calls 83 more. Total: 4 + 8 + 24 + 83 + 83 = 202? Actually: SB 4 + BB 8 + my raise 107 + Seat 5's call 83 = 202. But pot is 222, so maybe there's something else.\n\nWait, maybe my stack display is wrong. Or maybe I started with more chips and the 4 chips is what's left after the raise? But the action says I raised 107 preflop. If I started with more than 107, then I'd have chips left. But it says \"Your Stack: 4 chips\" now on the turn.\n\nActually, looking at the action: preflop Seat 3 raise 107. Then on flop: Seat 3 check. So I must have had more than 107 chips to raise that amount. But now I have 4 chips. So maybe I started with 111 chips? 111 - 107 = 4. That makes sense! I started with 111 chips, raised to 107, leaving 4 behind. Then on flop I checked (since I have 4 left, I'm effectively all-in? Actually no, because I still have 4 chips to bet on later streets).\n\nBut wait, if I raised to 107 preflop, and Seat 5 called, then the pot would be: my 107 + Seat 5's 107 = 214, plus blinds from SB and BB (4+8=12) = 226. Close to 222. Maybe some rounding.\n\nAnyway, the key point: I have 4 chips left, and it's the turn. Board: 7h Qd 8c 4s. My hand: 7c Ac. So I have a pair of 7s with Ace kicker. I hit middle pair on flop (7 on board matches my 7). Turn is 4s, no obvious flush draws. Board is 7h Qd 8c 4s - rainbow? Hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades - all different suits, so no flush possible.\n\nI have 4 chips left, which is 0.5 BB. Pot is 222 chips. I'm effectively all-in with my remaining 4 chips if I bet. But the action says \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check\". So I can check or fold. Since amount to call is 0, I should check. But why would I fold when I can check for free? I have a pair of 7s, maybe it's the best hand. Seat 5 checked the flop, which might indicate weakness. They raised preflop and called my 3-bet, so they likely have a decent hand: maybe QQ, AA, KK, AQ, etc. But they checked the flop, which is interesting with a Q on board. If they had QQ, they'd likely bet. Maybe they have AK, JJ, TT, 99, or a medium pair.\n\nWith only 4 chips left, I'm getting huge pot odds if I go all-in. But I can't bet now because only check is allowed. Actually, I can check, and then on river I might be able to bet my last 4 chips if Seat 5 checks again.\n\nBut wait, I need"

            "content": "I need to analyze this hand. I'm in the BTN with 7c Ac. My stack is only 4 chips (0.5 BB). The pot is 305 chips. Board is 7h Qd 8c 4s. I have middle pair with Ace kicker. Opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) bet 83 chips, but I only have 4 chips total. Wait, I'm confused. My stack shows 4 chips, but the hand history says I raised 107 preflop. That seems impossible if I only have 4 chips. Let me re-read.\n\nAh, I see! The hand history shows: preflop: Seat 3 raise 107. But my current stack is 4 chips. This must mean I went all-in preflop with my 4 chips, and the raise amount shown (107) might be a display issue or includes the SB I posted. Actually, looking at the actions: I posted SB 4, opponent raised to 24, then I raised to 107. But I only have 4 chips total. So I must have gone all-in preflop. The \"raise to 107\" is likely the total pot or something.\n\nActually, wait. Blinds are 4/8. I posted SB 4. Opponent raised to 24. I have 4 chips total. I can't raise to 107 with only 4 chips. This must be a mistake in the display. Let me think: I have 4 chips. I posted SB 4, so I'm all-in already. But the action says I raised 107. That doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe the stack display is wrong? Or maybe I had more chips earlier and lost them? Let me check the tournament context. I'm in a tournament. My stack is 4 chips (0.5 BB). That's extremely short. The pot is 305 chips. Opponent bet 83, but I only have 4 chips. The amount to call is 83, but I can't call 83 with only 4 chips. I must already be all-in.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions: fold, call. It says \"Amount to call: 83\". But if I only have 4 chips, I can only call 4. Maybe the interface expects me to call my remaining 4 chips? But the amount shown is 83, which is what opponent bet.\n\nLet me think about the actual situation: I have 4 chips. I'm effectively all-in already. The turn action: I checked, opponent bet 83. Since I have no chips left, I can't fold or call - I'm already all-in from preflop. But the system is asking for an action. Maybe I need to check if I'm actually all-in.\n\nWait, the hand history says: preflop: Seat 3 raise 107. That would put me all-in if I had 107 chips. But I have 4 chips. Something is inconsistent.\n\nPerhaps the stack of 4 chips is after posting the SB? I started with 4 chips, posted SB 4, so I'm all-in. The raise amount shown (107) might be the total pot size or something else.\n\nGiven the situation: I have middle pair with Ace kicker. The board is 7h Qd 8c 4s. I have a pair of 7s. Opponent could have many hands. With only 4 chips left (0.5 BB), I'm basically committed. The pot is 305 chips. If I call 4 chips to win 305, that's huge pot odds. Even if I'm behind, I have to call.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if I'm actually facing a bet of 83 or if I'm already all-in. The system says \"Amount to call: 83\" and legal actions are \"fold, call\". If I only have 4 chips, I can only call 4. But the interface might be showing the opponent's bet size, not what I need to put in.\n\nActually, in poker, if a player is all-in for less than a full bet, they can only win the portion of the pot they contributed to. But they still have to make a decision for their remaining chips. So I need to call my remaining 4 chips.\n\nGiven the pot odds: I'm putting in 4 chips to win 305+4 = 309 chips. That's 77:1 pot odds. I only need about 1.3% equity to break even. With a pair of 7s, I likely have at least that much equity unless opponent has a set or straight. But the board is 7h Qd 8c 4s.

I have 4 chips total, but need to call 83 chips. That means I'm essentially all-in with my 4 chips. Let me re-read the hand history:\n\nLooking at the actions:\n- Preflop: I posted SB of 4 chips (my entire stack)\n- Preflop: Seat 4 posted BB 8 chips  \n- Preflop: Seat 5 raised to 24\n- Preflop: I raised to 107 (but I only had 4 chips, so this must have been an all-in raise)\n- Preflop: Seat 5 called 83\n\nSo I'm already all-in with my 4 chips preflop! The pot is 305 chips, which includes my 4 chips. The turn action is happening, but I'm already all-in. The \"check\" on turn from me and the bet from opponent must be for side pot or something.\n\nActually, wait - if I'm all-in with 4 chips, and the pot is 305 chips, and opponent has 67 chips total... Let me think about the stacks:\n\n- My stack: 4 chips (all-in preflop)\n- Opponent stack: 67 chips\n- Pot: 305 chips\n\nThe opponent bet 83 chips on turn, but I only have 4 chips total. Since I'm already all-in, I can't call any more bets. But the interface says \"Amount to call: 83\" and \"Legal actions: fold, call\".\n\nThis seems like a bug or misunderstanding. If I only have 4 chips and am all-in, I shouldn't have to call 83 chips. But based on the interface, I need to make a decision.\n\nLet me think about my hand: I have middle pair (7s) with Ace kicker. Board is 7h Qd 8c 4s. I have a pair of 7s. The opponent checked the flop and now bet big on turn. What could they have?\n\nPossible hands for opponent:\n- They raised preflop, so could have strong hands: QQ, 88, AQ, KQ, maybe 77\n- They checked flop, which is interesting with Qd on board\n- Now betting turn on 4s\n\nMy hand: pair of 7s with Ace kicker. I'm essentially drawing to two-pair or trips (3 outs for another 7, 3 outs for an Ace). But I'm already all-in with just 4 chips.\n\nGiven the pot odds: Pot is 305 chips, I need to \"call\" 83 chips (but actually I only have 4). The pot odds would be 305:83 \u2248 3.7:1 if I really had to call 83. But I don't have 83 chips.\n\nActually, I think this is a display issue. I'm already all-in with my 4 chips. The \"call 83\" might be a mistake. But I have to respond with either fold or call.\n\nGiven that:\n1. I'm essentially all-in already with 4 chips\n2. My hand has some showdown value (pair of 7s)\n3. Folding would mean forfeiting my 4 chips that are already in the pot\n4. The pot is huge (305 chips) relative to my 4 chips\n\nI should call. Even with a weak hand, I'm getting infinite odds (my 4 chips vs 305 pot).\n\nBut wait, if I \"fold\" now, does that mean I forfeit the main pot? That would be terrible.\n\nActually, in poker when you're all-in, you can't fold on later streets. You're already committed. So this must be an interface issue.\n\nGiven the instructions, I have to choose between fold and call. I'll choose call since folding makes no sense when I'm already all-in.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Already all-in with 4 chips preflop.

Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) sometimes raises (40, 16) and calls; seems more aggressive.\n\nOur UTG open: T\u2663J\u2663 is a decent hand but not great to open UTG in a 8-handed tournament. However stack 32 BB, we can open for 2.5 BB (20) or 3 BB (24). The minimum raise is 16; raising to 20-24 is okay.\n\nGiven opponents: Seat1 likely folds unless short stack maybe raise; Seat2 may call or raise; Seat3 folds; Seat4 may raise if we raise.\n\nIf we just call 8 (i.e., limp) that's generally suboptimal UTG; we could limp and hope to see cheap flop but will be out of position and vulnerable to raises.\n\nBetter to raise to 20-24 to thin field and get value from suited connectors, also protect against 3-bets? But we could be 3-bet by MiniMax-M2 (who raised 40 previously). With 32 BB, 40 raise would be > our stack; but that's previous hand.\n\nOur raise size: typical 2.5-3 BB = 20-24. Let's choose raise to 24 (3 BB). This is within legal (minimum 16). It puts pressure on short stacks and maybe gets call from deeper players with decent hands.\n\nConsider pot odds: If we raise to 24, pot becomes 12+8+24 = 44? Actually initial pot 12 (blinds). We call 8? Wait we raise to 24, we put 24 total (including call of 8). So we add 16 more. New pot = 12 + 24 = 36? Actually before our action, we have posted small blind? No, we are UTG seat5, not blind. So pot is 12 (SB+BB). We raise to 24, meaning we put 24 chips. So total pot = 12 + 24 = 36. Opponents will need to call 24.\n\nGiven our hand, it's okay.\n\nThus action: raise to 24.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Minimum raise to 190 (so raise would be to 190 total). Opponent stack is 4 chips? Wait seat3 has 4 chips? Actually seat3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 4 chips. That's their stack size? It says 4 chips, so they are extremely short-stacked (4 chips). But they posted SB 4, so they are at 4 chips total? That seems they are on the brink, maybe they are effectively all-in? The raise to 107 is larger than their stack, but they can only raise up to their stack (4 chips). Something inconsistent: maybe they have 4 chips left after posting SB, but they raised to 107 meaning they are going all-in for 107? Actually if they have 4 chips, they cannot raise to 107. So maybe the data: seat3 has 4 chips (they are short). They posted SB 4, then they raise to 107, meaning they are effectively all-in for 107, which is more than they have, but maybe they are allowed to bet all-in for remaining chips (4). But raise amount 107 seems unrealistic. Could be a misprint: maybe seat3 has 311 chips? No seat2 has 311. seat3 is 4 chips, maybe they are the \"DeepSeek-V3.2\" with 4 chips, they are short. The raise to 107 is a big raise, maybe they have 107 chips after posting SB? Actually they posted 4, so remaining 0? This is confusing.\n\nNevertheless, we need to decide action: call 83 to 107, raise to 190 (minimum raise), or fold.\n\nOur hand: Tc Jc, suited connector, decent but not premium. Against a short stack 3-bet, they might be shoving all-in with a wide range. Our stack 233, we can call 83 to see flop, but risk losing 83 chips if we lose. In tournament, we have 29 BB, not short, but we want to preserve chips. However, if opponent is short-stacked and likely all-in, we can call with decent equity. TcJc vs unknown short stack range: likely they have strong hands (AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe some suited connectors). Our equity maybe around 30-35% vs that range. Pot odds: pot currently 139, opponent adds 107 making pot 246? Actually pot after raise: initial pot 139 (includes blinds and our raise). Then opponent raises to 107 (adds 83). So pot is 139 + 83 = 222? Wait preflop pot: blinds 4+8=12, our raise to 24 adds 16 extra (so total pot 12+24? Actually we put 24, they put 4+8? Let's compute: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, we raise to 24 (so we put 24 total, meaning we added 16). So pot after our raise = 4+8+24 = 36. Then seat1,2 fold. Then seat3 raises to 107 (adds 83 more). So pot = 36 + 83 = 119. Actually also includes their original 4? Already counted. So pot now 119. We need to call 83 to win 119. Pot odds: need to call 83 to win 119, so odds = 83/(119+83) = 83/202 \u2248 41%. So need >41% equity to be profitable. Our equity vs their range maybe 30-35%, not enough. So fold is correct.\n\nBut if they are short stack and likely all-in, we may consider calling if we have decent equity and can win chips. However pot odds 41% is high. Our hand is not strong enough. So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: recall shows they often fold preflop, occasionally raise small amounts (12, 32). Not much info. But they are short stack, may be desperate.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to respond with correct JSON. Need to decide action. Hand: BB with TcJc, raise 24 (3BB) then 3-bet to 107 from Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) after initial raise? Actually preflop: seat3 posted SB 4, seat4 posted BB 8, seat5 raise 24 (our raise). Then seat3 raise 107 (so a 3-bet). Now we face 83 to call, min raise to 190. Stack 233. Our hand is suited JTs. In BB position, we raised first, then got 3-bet. With 29 BB stack, we could consider 4-bet all-in? Stack 233, min raise 190, all-in is 233. JcTc suited is decent for 4-bet vs 3-bet from unknown opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2). But they have 4 chips? Actually seat3 has 4 chips (they are short stack). Wait seat3 stack is 4 chips, so they are effectively all-in for 4? But they raised to 107, but they only have 4 chips? That seems contradictory: seat3 has 4 chips total, cannot raise to 107. Maybe the data: seat3 is 4 chips total, but they posted SB 4, so they are short-stacked and went all-in for 4? The raise to 107 may be a mistake. However we must treat as given: seat3 raise 107, meaning they have enough chips. But their stack is 4? That's impossible. Probably seat3 is short stack and is all-in for 4, but the raise amount shown is 107 (maybe total pot after raise?). Might be a bug. Let's assume seat3 is short stack and is all-in for 4 chips. But amount to call is 83, min raise 190. If they are all-in for 4, we could just call 4? But amount to call is 83, which is larger. Something off.\n\nGiven situation, we have 29 BB, opponent is deep (311 chips). Actually seat2 has 311 chips but folded. So seat3 has 4 chips but they raised to 107? Maybe seat3 is 4 chips after posting SB, they are short and cannot raise. So maybe seat3 is actually DeepSeek-V3.2 with 311 chips? No seat2 is Kimi-K2 with 311 chips. So seat3 has 4 chips; they cannot raise. So maybe it's a misprint. We should treat as a legitimate 3-bet to 107. Our hand JcTc is a good 4-bet candidate vs 3-bet from unknown opponent, especially with 29 BB. The raise to 190 would be 190 total, leaving us 233-190=43 chips left, not all-in. Could also go all-in 233. Considering tournament, we have medium stack, could 4-bet all-in to apply pressure, but JcTc is not premium, but it's a good hand for 4-bet vs 3-bet, especially against unknown opponent. However 4-bet all-in could be risky vs a strong range. Might be better to call and see flop? But calling 83 puts us with 150 chips left, still decent. But we are out of position after call (still BB). The opponent's 3-bet range likely includes strong combos, but also some bluffs. JcTc has ~35% equity vs typical 3-bet range. The pot after call would be 139+24+107+83 = 353? Actually pot currently 139, we raised 24, opponent 107, now call 83 makes pot ~139+24+107+83 = 353. Our equity 35% gives expected value = 0.35*353 = 124 > 83 call, so positive. So call is okay. Raising to 190 (4-bet) would be aggressive, but we might be risking all-in.\n\nGiven tournament, medium stack, I'd call to see flop and keep options.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nReturn JSON.",

So remaining stack = 150-107 = 43 chips. Pot after call: initial pot: blinds 4+8=12, plus our raise 24 (adds 24), opponent raise to 107 (adds 83 more from opponent?), Actually sequence: SB 4, BB 8, we raise to 24 (we put 24 total, so additional 16 beyond BB?), but okay. Then seat3 raise to 107 (adds 83 from them). Then we call 83. So pot now: 4+8+24+107+83 = 226? But given pot is 222. Slight discrepancy but fine. Our remaining stack is 150 - (24+83) = 43. So we are short-stacked relative to pot. On flop board 7h Qd 8c. We have Tc Jc: that gives us an open-ended straight draw (9 and 10? Actually we have T and J, board 7,8, Q. So we have 9? Wait we have T and J, board has 7,8,Q. Straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K? Actually we need 9 and 10 to make straight 7-8-9-10-J or 8-9-10-J-Q. We have T,J, so we need 9 and K? Let's examine: With T,J we can make straight with 9-10-J-Q-K? No we need 9 and K? Actually the board is 7,8,Q. To have straight we need 9-10-J? Let's list combos: 7-8-9-10-J (we have T,J, need 9). That's one straight: 7-8-9-10-J uses our J and T, board 7,8, need 9. The other: 8-9-10-J-Q uses our T,J, board 8,Q, need 9. So we need a 9 to complete straight (any suit). Also we have a gutshot? Actually we need 9 only. So we have a single-card draw (open-ended? Actually both ends are 9? Both combos require 9, so it's a gutshot? Wait open-ended means two cards complete, but only 9 works, so it's a single card draw (one-rank). So we have a one-out? Actually there are four 9s, but some may be dead (we don't know). So about 4 outs.\n\nWe also have a flush draw? We have clubs: Tc and Jc, board has 8c, so we have a flush draw (clubs). Actually board: 7h Qd 8c. So we have two clubs in hand, one club on board, need two more clubs to make flush. That's a 9-out flush draw (since 13 clubs total, we have 2, board 1, leaving 10 clubs left, but two needed, probability of hitting on turn or river). So we have both straight draw (one rank) and flush draw.\n\nWe have 43 chips left, pot 222, effective stack 43 (we are short). Opponent seat3 checked. Amount to call is 0, min raise 83 (which is larger than our stack). So we cannot raise (cannot meet min raise). Options: check (or bet all-in? Actually raise is not possible because raise_to must be at least min raise 83, we cannot, so we can only check). Could we go all-in as a raise? The rule: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So we could go all-in with 43, which is less than min raise, but it's allowed as an all-in raise. So legal actions: fold, check, raise (but raise would be all-in). But we have to consider opponent's tendencies: He checked on flop after 3-betting preflop and we called. He may be weak or trap. With our draw, we could bet (go all-in) to put pressure. Our stack is 43, pot 222, so an all-in bet would be about 19% of pot, not huge. Might be good to shove to try to win pot now or later.\n\nBut opponent's stack: He had 4 chips? Wait seat3 had 4"

So we have both straight draw (one rank) and flush draw.\n\nWe have 43 chips left, pot 222, effective stack 43 (we are short). Opponent seat3 checked. Amount to call is 0, min raise 83 (which is larger than our stack). So we cannot raise (cannot meet min raise). Options: check (or bet all-in? Actually raise is not possible because raise_to must be at least min raise 83, we cannot, so we can only check). Could we go all-in as a raise? The rule: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So we could go all-in with 43, which is less than min raise, but it's allowed as an all-in raise. So legal actions: fold, check, raise (but raise would be all-in). But we have to consider opponent's tendencies: He checked on flop after 3-betting preflop and we called. He may be weak or trap. With our draw, we could bet (go all-in) to put pressure. Our stack is 43, pot 222, so an all-in bet would be about 19% of pot, not huge. Might be good to shove to try to win pot now or later.\n\nBut opponent's stack: He had 4 chips? Wait seat3 had 4",

Even with 3:1 pot odds, 3-4 offsuit has very poor equity against any reasonable big blind range.\n\nThe correct play is to fold and hope for a better spot in the next hands, as I still have some fold equity if I shove first in later hands.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"With only 0.5 BB left and 3-4 offsuit, this is an easy fold.

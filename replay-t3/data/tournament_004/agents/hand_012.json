            "reasoning_content": "  I need to analyze the situation. Let me look at the data:\n\n1. **My hand**: 5c 5h (pocket 5s) - decent small pair\n2. **Position**: CO (Cutoff) - good position\n3. **Stack**: 222 chips (111 BB) - healthy stack\n4. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called 2 chips\n\nFrom the opponent recall data on GPT-OSS-120B:\n- Hand 6: folded preflop\n- Hand 7: folded preflop\n- Hand 9: called preflop, then check-folded on river\n- Hand 10: folded preflop\n- Hand 11: folded preflop\n- Hand 3: Had Qs Ks at showdown (lost to QQ)\n\nThis opponent seems to be playing relatively tight, folding most hands preflop. When they do call, they seem to play passively (checking then folding).\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- Pocket 5s is a decent hand but vulnerable to overcards\n- I'm in good position (CO)\n- Only one caller so far, and they're playing tight/passive\n- I have a healthy stack\n- I could try to steal the blinds, or set mine\n\nWith pocket 5s from CO against a tight player who just called, I have a few options:\n1. Fold - too tight, 55 is playable\n2. Call - set mining, seeing if I hit a 5 on flop\n3. Raise - try to steal the pot preflop\n\nGiven the opponent's tight/passive tendencies, a raise could work well here. However, I need to consider that I have another player behind me (Seat 2) who hasn't acted yet.\n\nLet me consider the raise size. Minimum raise is 4 (to 2 more chips). A standard raise would be 3-4x the big blind, so 6-8 chips total.\n\nWith pocket 5s, I want to either:\n- See a cheap flop to set mine, or\n- Take down the pot preflop against a weak range\n\nA raise to 6-8 chips seems appropriate. Let me go with 8 chips (4x BB), which is a standard size.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The minimum raise is to 4 chips total, which is only 2 more. That's too small. I should raise to at least 6-8 chips. Given my position and the tight opponent, a raise to 8 chips (4x BB) seems good to apply pressure.\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. Let me think about the stack sizes. The opponent who called (Seat 5) has 392 chips, so they're deep stacked. The blinds have 87 and 113 chips respectively.\n\nWith pocket 5s, I'm either looking to:\n1. Set mine (call and see flop cheaply)\n2. Steal the pot preflop (raise)\n\nGiven that I'm in the cutoff and there's only one caller who seems tight, a raise is a good play. But I should also consider that if I just call, I might see a cheap multiway flop which is good for set mining.\n\nLet me think about the odds. To set mine profitably, I need good implied odds. With 222 chips and the opponent having 392, there's good implied odds potential.\n\nHowever, the simplest and often best play with pocket 5s from CO facing one limper is to raise and try to take down the pot preflop, or at least get heads-up with initiative.\n\nI'll raise to 8 chips total (4x BB).",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm in BB with pocket 5s (5c 5h)\n- Pot is 39 chips\n- I raised to 8, opponent in Seat 2 re-raised to 26\n- I need to call 18 more chips to see a flop\n- Minimum raise to 44 (which would put 18 more chips on top of the 26)\n- My stack: 214 chips (107 BB)\n\n**Opponent analysis (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2):**\nFrom the opponent actions I retrieved:\n- In Hand 3, they played aggressively with Jd Ad, betting on river with 60 chips\n- They've made preflop raises in hands 6 and 7 (8 and 6 chips respectively)\n- They've folded preflop in hands 4, 8, 9, and 11\n- They seem to be a relatively tight-aggressive player\n- Their 3-bet to 26 here is significant - about 13x the BB\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- Pocket 5s is a decent hand but vulnerable\n- I'm out of position (BB)\n- Calling 18 chips to win 39 (getting about 2.17:1 odds)\n- If I call, pot will be 57 chips\n- If I raise to 44, that's putting in 36 more chips\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm out of position which is bad for pocket pairs\n- I have a healthy stack of 107 BB\n- Opponent has 61 chips (30.5 BB), so they're relatively short\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I should be careful with my chips but pocket 5s can be profitable\n- The opponent's 3-bet size suggests strength\n- Out of position, I should be more cautious\n\n**Decision:**\nThe 3-bet to 26 is large, suggesting real strength. Pocket 5s don't play well out of position, especially against what appears to be a strong range. While I have good pot odds (2.17:1), the positional disadvantage and the opponent's aggressive action makes this a fold. I don't want to invest 18 chips out of position with a small pocket pair that will only flop a set about 12% of the time.\n\nIf I hit a set, I could win big, but most of the time I'll be check-folding. The opponent's stack size (61 chips) also means I can't win that much even if I hit my set. This is a clear fold.",

Offsuit, disconnected, low cards.\n\n**Position:** SB (small blind) - Worst position postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 113 chips (56.5 BB) - Healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Call 2 (limp)\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Raise to 8 (4x BB)\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Re-raise to 26 (13x BB!)\n\n**Pot:** 39 chips currently\n**To call:** 25 chips (12.5 BB)\n**Min raise:** 44 (would be 19 BB raise from me)\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has 61 chips total. Just put in 26 chips (almost half his stack!). This looks like a strong re-raise, possibly all-in commitment. He's shown some aggression in past hands (raises in hands 3, 6, 7). In hand 3 he showed AJ suited.\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has 214 chips. Raised to 8, now faces a big re-raise. Has been mostly passive/folding, but raised in hand 11.\n\n**My situation:**\n- Terrible hand (6\u2660 T\u2663)\n- Facing a huge re-raise (13x BB)\n- Would need to call 25 chips (22% of my stack) with a weak hand\n- Out of position for entire hand\n- Seat 2's re-raise is massive relative to his stack (26 of 61 chips)\n- Seat 1 still to act behind me\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 39 + my call 25 = 64. I'd be investing 25 to win 64, giving me 2.56:1 odds (28% equity needed). With 6\u2660 T\u2663, I likely have less than 20% equity against a re-raising range.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have a healthy stack (56.5 BB). No need to gamble with terrible hands. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an easy fold. The hand is terrible, position is bad, facing strong aggression, and pot odds don't justify calling with such weak holdings.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"6\u2660 T\u2663 is a very weak hand from SB position facing a massive re-raise (13x BB).

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n1. **My Hand**: 2d 6d (suited connectors, very weak)\n2. **Position**: Small blind (Seat 4)\n3. **Stack**: 181 chips (90.5 BB)\n4. **Current situation**: \n   - Seat 5 called the 2 chip blind\n   - Seat 1 raised to 8 chips\n   - Seat 2 raised to 26 chips (this is the current action)\n   - Seat 3 folded\n   - Amount to call: 24 chips (to match Seat 2's raise)\n   - Minimum raise to: 44 chips\n\nFrom my search of opponent actions, I can see that Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising preflop in previous hands, including one showdown where they had Jd Ad (Jack of diamonds, Ace of diamonds) which is a strong hand.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- My hand 2d 6d is extremely weak, especially in a multi-way pot with two raises already\n- I'm getting 24:1 pot odds (39 chips already in pot vs 24 to call)\n- However, this is a tournament situation and I need to be careful with my stack\n- With 181 chips, I'm not short-stacked, but I also can't afford to make loose calls\n- The fact that Seat 2 raised to 26 chips (quite large relative to the blinds) suggests they have a strong hand\n- I'm out of position for the rest of the hand\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. Hand strength: 2d 6d is very weak, especially suited connectors at the bottom end\n2. Position: I'm in the small blind, out of position\n3. Action: Two players have already raised, suggesting strength\n4. Stack preservation: I have a decent stack and should be selective\n5. Pot odds: While the odds look good mathematically, the hand strength doesn't justify calling\n\nGiven that I have a very weak hand, I'm out of position, and there have been two raises suggesting strong opposition, this is clearly a fold situation. Even though the pot odds look attractive, the actual strength of my hand and the likelihood of being dominated make this an easy fold.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action. Hand: Kd Th in SB, after posting SB 1, BB 2, we called 2 (so we are in). Then seat1 (UTG?) raised to 8, seat2 (next) re-raised to 26 (so a 3-bet). Now it's our turn, amount to call 24 (since we already have 2 in pot, need to add 24 to match 26). Minimum raise to 44 (i.e., raise to at least 44 total). Stack 392, deep.\n\nWe need to consider hand strength: KTh offsuit is decent but not premium. In SB facing a 3-bet from seat2 (likely short stack? seat2 has 61 chips). Actually seat2 stack 61 chips, so they are short. They raised to 26 (13 big blinds). That's a sizable raise for a short stack; likely they are trying to go all-in or have a strong hand. Our stack is large, but we are out of position post-flop (SB will be first to act post-flop). Opponent seat2 likely is a short stack, maybe they want to steal or they have a strong hand. KTh is not a good 3-bet call vs a short stack raising big.\n\nWe could fold. Could also call? Let's consider pot odds: current pot before our decision: pot includes blinds (1+2) + our call 2 + raise 8 + re-raise 26 = 39? Actually pot shown is 39. To call 24, pot will become 63. So pot odds 24/63 = 38% to win. KTh vs unknown range of short stack's 3-bet (maybe wide but includes many strong hands). KTh off-suit likely not >38% equity vs typical 3-bet range. So fold is likely.\n\nAlso tournament: preserving stack is important.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

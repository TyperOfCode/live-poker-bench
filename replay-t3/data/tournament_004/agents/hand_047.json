Offsuit, low cards with no connecting potential.\n\n**Position:** SB (worst position after the flop)\n\n**Stack size:** 119 chips (14.9 BB) - I'm short-stacked but not critically short yet.\n\n**Opponent action:** Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 24 (3x BB). Looking at opponent history:\n- They raised in hand #39 with a raise to 12\n- They've mostly been folding preflop recently (hands 40, 41, 43, 44, 46)\n- They called a raise of 24 in hand #42 and continued postflop\n\n**Pot odds:** Current pot is 36 (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24). I need to call 20 to win 36, giving me pot odds of 36:20 or 1.8:1. I need ~35.7% equity to break even.\n\n**Hand equity:** Against a reasonable raising range from early position, 53o has maybe 20-25% equity at best. Against a tight range, it's even worse.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 14.9 BB, I'm short but not desperate. I should wait for better spots. Calling from the SB with this terrible hand out of position is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n**Better alternatives:** \n1. Fold and preserve chips\n2. If I had a stronger hand, maybe consider 3-bet shoving as a bluff, but with 53o that's terrible\n\nThe only reason to continue would be if I thought the raiser was very weak and I could outplay them postflop, but with 53o from the SB, that's highly unlikely.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. This hand is trash, I'm out of position, and I don't have good odds. I should wait for a better spot with my short stack.",

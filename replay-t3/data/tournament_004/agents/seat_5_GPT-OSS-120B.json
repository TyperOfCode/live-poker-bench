With Ace we have backdoor flush? Two hearts on board, we have Ace of spades, queen of spades, no hearts. So we have a gutshot straight draw: need 5 or 9 to complete straight (6-7-8). Actually we have 6-7-8, we need 5 or 9 to make straight. We have Ace and Queen, no 5 or 9. So no immediate made hand. Also we have overcards Ace and Queen, but board is low. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) checked to us. We are in BB, after preflop raise to 8 and opponent called, and BB called 6 (so pot 25). Opponent checked. We have position? Actually we are BB, we are first to act after flop? The flop action: seat4 (MiniMax-M2) check, then it's our turn. So we are out of position (since we are BB but after flop we act after opponent). So we have to decide: check, bet (raise). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot call because amount to call is 0. So options: check, or bet (raise). We need to consider opponent tendencies. We have no data on MiniMax-M2 flop checks; recall shows none. Could search for general patterns? Might recall opponent preflop raise? In preflop, they called our raise. So they are likely a calling station or maybe a decent player. Stack sizes: both around 192 chips, we have 192-? Actually we raised 8 preflop, we have 192-8? But we still have 192 chips because we are seat5 with 192 stack? Actually after raise 8, we have 192-8? The stack listed is 192 chips (96 BB). Probably includes our remaining after posting blinds? But we posted 2 blind? Actually we are BB, posted 2, then raised to 8, so net we put 8 (including blind). So remaining stack about 184? But not needed.\n\nWe have a decent hand: Ace high with gutshot and backdoor flush draw. Could bet to protect and maybe take pot. Board is coordinated (6-7-8). Opponent may have straight draws (5-9), two pair, sets? But board is low, unlikely set (6-7-8). Could have 6-6, 7-7, 8-8 combos. Could have combos that beat us. Our raise size: minimum raise to 6 (i.e., raise to 6 total? Actually amount to call 0, minimum raise is 6 meaning we need to bet at least 6 chips). Pot is 25. A typical continuation bet maybe half pot (12-13). We can bet 12 to 15. We have decent equity: we have about 12% straight draw + backdoor flush maybe 4% + Ace high maybe 10% vs unknown range. Could be okay to bet.\n\nConsider tournament: we have medium stack, 96 BB, can afford to gamble. Opponent's tendencies unknown. Might be safe to bet to protect against draws and take pot if they missed.\n\nThus raise to maybe 12 chips (total bet). Since legal raise to 6 minimum, we can raise to 12. Provide reasoning.\n\nThus output JSON.",

Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) call 5 (since they already posted 1, they call additional 5 to match 6). Amount to call is 4 (we need to put 4 more to call 6). Minimum raise to 10 (so raise to total 10). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand QcKs (unsuited). In BB vs raise from UTG? Actually seat2 is maybe early position (seat2 after seat1). Not sure seat numbers correspond to positions but seat2 is likely UTG or maybe early. We have deep stack 107.5 BB, so can play.\n\nOur hand is decent: King-Queen offsuit, not premium but playable in BB vs a raise and two callers. The raise size is 6 (3 BB). That's small. Multiway pot, we have position after flop (we are in BB, after the flop we will be first to act? Actually after flop, action starts with UTG (seat2) then seat3 then seat4 then seat5 (us). So we are last preflop, after flop we will be after seat4? Actually seat4 is SB, seat5 is BB. So after flop, action starts with the player left of the button (SB) or UTG? In a 5-player table, button is seat5? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is maybe button? Not sure. But we are likely last to act preflop; after flop, action starts with seat2 (UTG) then seat3, seat4, then us. So we will be last on each street, which is good.\n\nGiven we have QcKs, we can consider 3-betting or calling. The raise is small (3 BB). With 2 callers already, pot is already 6*3 = 18 plus blinds and SB? Actually pot after actions: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6 (so seat2 puts 6 total, i.e., 6-2=4 extra?), call 6 from seat3 (they put 6 total), call 5 from seat4 (they put 5 total). So pot = SB 1 + BB 2 + seat2 6 + seat3 6 + seat4 5 = 20? Actually they said pot: 20 chips. Yes.\n\nSo if we call 4, pot becomes 24, we have 4 in, total pot 24. If we raise to 10 (i.e., total 10), we add 8 more chips, pot becomes 28 (since we add 8). That would be a 4-bet? Actually we are 3-betting (original raise 6, we raise to 10). That's a small 3-bet size (5 BB total). Might be okay.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: recall opponent seat2 (Kimi-K2) previous actions: hand1 fold preflop, hand2 call preflop 8 (so they raised? Actually they called 8? Not sure). They folded on flop. Not much data.\n\nSeat3 DeepSeek-V3.2 unknown.\n\nSeat4 MiniMax-M2 posted SB and called. Not much.\n\nOur hand QcKs is not a strong raising hand against a 3 BB raise, especially with two callers. Could call and see flop. 3-bet may be too aggressive but could isolate. However we are out of position preflop but will be in position postflop. 3-bet could be okay to take control.\n\nGiven we have a decent stack and want to preserve chips, maybe call and see flop. The raise is small; calling is fine.\n\nPot odds: we need to call 4 to win 20 (already) plus our call adds to pot 24, so pot odds ~4/24 = 1:6, good.\n\nThus call.\n\nReasoning: decent hand, multiway, raise small, want to see flop, preserve stack.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null.\n\n"

If we raise to 10 (i.e., total 10), we add 8 more chips, pot becomes 28 (since we add 8). That would be a 4-bet? Actually we are 3-betting (original raise 6, we raise to 10). That's a small 3-bet size (5 BB total). Might be okay.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: recall opponent seat2 (Kimi-K2) previous actions: hand1 fold preflop, hand2 call preflop 8 (so they raised? Actually they called 8? Not sure). They folded on flop. Not much data.\n\nSeat3 DeepSeek-V3.2 unknown.\n\nSeat4 MiniMax-M2 posted SB and called. Not much.\n\nOur hand QcKs is not a strong raising hand against a 3 BB raise, especially with two callers. Could call and see flop. 3-bet may be too aggressive but could isolate. However we are out of position preflop but will be in position postflop. 3-bet could be okay to take control.\n\nGiven we have a decent stack and want to preserve chips, maybe call and see flop. The raise is small; calling is fine.\n\nPot odds: we need to call 4 to win 20 (already) plus our call adds to pot 24, so pot odds ~4/24 = 1:6, good.\n\nThus call.\n\nReasoning: decent hand, multiway, raise small, want to see flop, preserve stack.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null.\n\n",

Seat3 called, could be medium. Seat4 checked, maybe weak. We have top pair but vulnerable. Raising could protect and get value from weaker hands like KJ, Qx, J10, etc. But risk of re-raise from stronger opponent (like set). If we raise to, say, 12 (minimum raise is 4, so raise to 12? Actually raise amount total? Minimum raise to 4 means you need to put total 4 chips? Wait amount to call is 0, min raise to 4 means you need to raise at least to 4 chips total (i.e., bet 4). So we could raise to 8, 12, etc.\n\nGiven pot 24, a bet of 8 is 1/3 pot, could be okay. But we might want to protect against draws: board has potential straight draws? Actually there is a gutshot: 8-J? Let's compute: board T Q 6, possible straight draws: 8-9? Not. The only straight that uses both board cards is 8-9-10-J-Q (needs 8 and 9, J). That's two cards, not possible. Or 7-8-9-10-J (needs 7,8,9,J). Not possible. So there are no immediate straight draws. Flush draws: need two spades or two clubs? Board spade 6, clubs none. So only one spade on board, you have one spade, need two more spades for flush draw, not possible. So limited draws.\n\nThus checking could allow opponent to bet and we can call or raise later. But we have good hand; we could bet for value. Since opponent seat2 raised preflop, they may have strong hand like AK, AQ, etc. If they have AK, they have Ace high, we beat them. If they have AQ, they'd have top two pair? Actually they would have AQ, they'd have two pair (Q and A? No board Q T 6, they have A Q, they'd have pair of Qs with Ace kicker, same as us but we have K kicker, they have A kicker, they'd be ahead. So we would be behind. So raising could be risky if they have AQ.\n\nBut we don't know. Maybe check to see their action. However typical strategy: with top pair in BB after opponent checked, you could check behind if you think you are not best. But we have decent equity.\n\nGiven we are deep (105 BB), we can afford to bet. I think raising to 12 (half pot) is good to extract value from weaker hands and protect. If they have a set they may re-raise, but we can fold. So choose raise.\n\nThus JSON: action \"raise\", raise_to 12, reasoning.\n\n",

Board: T Q 6 4, we have Qc Ks, so pair of queens, K kicker, also we have open-ended straight draw? No, need J and 9 for straight, not present. So just pair.\n\nPot 60. Opponents: Seat2 (Kimi-K2) and Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) are still in. Seat2 raised preflop 6, called by Seat3, Seat4 (folded later), Seat5 (us) called 4. So preflop we called 4 (bb). On flop we bet 12, both called. So pot after flop: initial pot 60? Actually pot listed 60 at turn start includes flop betting? Let's compute: Preflop: blinds 1/2, SB 1, BB 2, then raise to 6, call 6, call 5, call 4 => contributions: SB 1, BB 2, Seat1 folded, Seat2 raised 6 (plus 2 blind? Actually raise 6 means total 6?), but anyway pot after preflop maybe 1+2+6+6+5+4 =24? Not sure. Flop: Seat4 check, we bet 12, Seat2 call 12, Seat3 call 12. So added 12*3 =36. So pot becomes 24+36=60. Yes pot 60 at turn. Good.\n\nNow turn card is unknown to us? Actually board shows Th Qd 6s 4c (four cards). So turn is 4c. So we are on turn after betting on flop. Now amount to call? Not given. We need to decide action. The legal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call is 0 (so no bet yet). Minimum raise to 12.\n\nWe need to decide whether to bet/raise or check. Opponents: Seat2 (Kimi-K2) and Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2). We have no info on their tendencies. We can recall previous actions: we just raised preflop? Actually we called preflop. On flop we bet 12 (half pot). Both called. So they seem willing to call with maybe medium strength.\n\nOur hand: top pair, decent kicker. Potential threats: opponent could have a set (TT, QQ, 66). TT possible? Board has T, so set of tens would be TT in hand, but we have K and Q, so opponent could have T? Actually they could have TT (two tens) but there is only one ten on board, so remaining three tens in deck, they could have TT. Similarly QQ set possible (one queen on board, they could have QQ). Also 66 set possible (one six on board). Also straight draws: 9-8? Not relevant. Also two pair combos: QJ, QT, etc.\n\nWe have top pair, but vulnerable to sets. Pot 60, we have 199 chips. We could bet to protect, maybe raise to ~30-40. Turn raise to 30 would be decent.\n\nBut we need to consider tournament stage: 199 chips, blinds 1/2, so effective stack ~100 BB, decent. We can be aggressive.\n\nWhat about opponent's stack sizes: Seat2 173, Seat3 163. Both similar. So we could attempt to extract value.\n\nCheck vs bet: If we check, we give free card (river) and risk opponent hitting set or improving. Better to bet.\n\nRaise amount: Minimum raise is 12, but we can raise more. We need to decide a raise amount. Typically pot-sized bet on turn (60) = 60. Could raise to 70? But we have to consider we are in SB, out of position. Might want to bet around 30-40 to protect.\n\nWe can also consider that we have a decent hand, we want to protect against draws like J9 for straight? Actually board: T Q 6 4, straight draws: 8-9? Not. The only straight draw is 8-9- J? No. So not many draws. So maybe a smaller bet is okay.\n\nBut opponent could have a made hand like QJ (two pair QJ) or QT (two pair Q T) which we beat? Actually QJ is two pair QJ, we have pair Q, kicker K, which beats QJ? Two pair beats one pair, so QJ > QK? Actually QJ is Q and J pair? Wait board: Qd, Th, 6s, 4c. Opponent with QJ would have two pair Q and J? No"

Actually board: Th (hearts), Qd (diamonds), 6s (spades), 4c (clubs), 6d (diamonds). No flush possible. We have pair of queens. Opponents: Seat2 (Kimi-K2) and Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2). Both called our bets on flop and turn. We bet 12 on flop, they called. Turn we bet 40, they called. So they are calling big bets, maybe they have strong hands or draws. Board now has paired 6s. Potential full house possibilities: 6-6, Q-6, etc. Opponent could have 66, 6x, Qx, TT, maybe straight draws? Board: T, Q, 6,4,6. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q? No J not present. 5-6-7-8-9? No. So no straight. Potential two pair: Q6, Q4, QT, 6T, 64 etc. Our hand is Qc Ks, so we have top pair Q but K kicker. Opponent could have Qx (pair of queens with better kicker maybe). Could have T? TT gives top two pair TQ? Actually TT would give pair of tens plus board pair of queens, so they'd have two pair (Tens and Queens). That's better than our Q pair? Actually two pair beats one pair. So TT beats us. Also 66 would give full house (6s over something). Actually board already has pair of 6s, so if opponent has a 6, they'd have full house 6s over whatever. That beats us. Also Q6 gives full house Q over 6? Wait board: Qd and we have Qc, board also has 6s pair. If opponent has Q6 they'd have two pair Q and 6, but board already has pair of 6s, so they'd have trips? Actually board: two 6s, one Q. If opponent has Q6, they'd have Q (pair with board) plus a 6 gives them trips 6? Let's compute: board: Th Qd 6s 4c 6d. So board has pair of 6s, plus T and Q. If opponent has Q6, they'd have a Q (pair with board Q) and a 6 (makes three of a kind 6s). So they'd have trips 6s with a queen kicker, which beats our pair of queens. So many combos beat us.\n\nWe bet heavily on flop and turn, and they called each time. That suggests they have strong hand, maybe a set or two pair or a draw they think is good. They might have 66 (set) which would be huge. They could also have Qx (top pair with good kicker). They could have T? TT would give two pair tens and queens, which is strong. They could have 64? 64 would give two pair 6 and 4? Actually board has 6 and 4, so 64 gives two pair (6s and 4s) plus a queen kicker? That would be two pair (6s and 4s) which is less than Q pair? Actually two pair beats one pair, so they'd beat us.\n\nGiven they called our bets, we should consider that they likely have a strong hand. Our hand is likely behind. We could check to see if they bet, but they have no action left (amount to call 0). We could check or raise. Raising might be risky; they could fold or call with worse. But they have shown willingness to call large bets. Could we value bet? Our hand is not best likely. So checking is safe. If we check, they might check back, we win the pot. If they bet, we can fold.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We'll check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Actually we have queen on board, we have queen in hand, so we have two pair? Wait board: Th Qd 6s 4c 6d. That's a pair of sixes and a queen on board. Our hand Qc Ks gives us pair of queens (queen on board + queen in hand) plus king kicker, plus the board also has a ten. So we have two pair: queens and sixes, with K kicker? Actually two pair: Qs and 6s, kicker K (since board also has Ten). So we have Q Q (pair) + 6 6 (pair). That's decent.\n\nOpponent (Seat2) bet 60 into pot 240+ previous bets? Let's compute pot: At river after turn betting: Preflop pot: blinds 1+2=3, plus raises etc. Let's compute: Preflop contributions: Seat2 raised to 6 (so 6 total?), seat3 call 6, seat4 call 5 (since they already posted small blind 1? Actually seat4 posted sb 1, seat5 posted bb 2. Preflop: seat2 raise 6 (so they put 6 total), seat3 call 6, seat4 call 5 (they had 1 posted, so add 5), seat5 call 4 (they had 2 posted, so add 2?). Wait seat5 call 4 means they put total 4? Actually they posted 2, call 4 means they add 2 more? Might be ambiguous. Anyway pot is 240 before river. Then flop: seat5 bet 12, seat2 call 12, seat3 call 12. So pot adds 12*3=36. Turn: seat5 bet 40, seat2 call 40, seat3 call 40: adds 120. So pot before river = 240 + 36 + 120 = 396? But given pot after turn maybe 240 includes those? The description says Pot: 240 chips (maybe current pot before river). Actually they list Pot: 240 chips at top of hand. That likely is pot size before river betting (i.e., after turn betting). So river: seat5 check, seat2 bet 60. So now pot is 240 + 60 = 300 (if call). Need to call 60.\n\nWe need to decide if we call, fold, or raise. Consider opponent tendencies. We have limited info: we can recall opponent actions. Let's query opponent seat2 actions."

          "content": "We didn't get opponent data, maybe no history. We can consider general tournament considerations: Stack 159, opponent 73. Opponent is short stack (73). They bet 60, likely trying to steal or go all-in? Their stack after bet: they have 73 chips total, they bet 60, leaving 13. So they are committing most of stack. This is a shove-ish move. Our stack 159, we can call 60 and still have 99 left. If we call and lose, we lose 60 and go to 99, still decent. If we fold, we lose 0 now but give opponent chips, they will be eliminated (since they have 13 left). Might be okay.\n\nOur hand: Qc Ks, board has Q and two sixes. Opponent could have 6x for trips, or a straight draw? Board: Th Qd 6s 4c 6d. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q? Not. 9-10-J-Q-K? No J missing. So straight not possible. Flush not possible (two spades, two clubs, two diamonds). So only made hands are pairs, two pair, trips, full house (if they have a 6 or Q). Opponent could have 6x for full house (6-6-6 + Q?). Actually board already has pair of sixes. If opponent has a 6, they'd have trips sixes, plus board Q, making trips. If opponent has Q, they'd have trips queens? Actually board has Q, they have Q, they'd have two queens (pair) not trips. So only trips if they have a six. Full house possible if they have 6 and another six? No only one six left (6c? board has 6s and 6d, missing 6h and 6c). If they have 6c they'd have three sixes (full house? Actually board has pair sixes, they have another six, making three of a kind sixes plus queen pair on board, that's a full house sixes full of queens? Wait board: Qd, Th, 6s, 4c, 6d. That's pair sixes and a queen. If opponent has a six, they'd have three sixes + queen = trips sixes with queen kicker, not full house because need pair on board of another rank. Actually board has Q, so they would have three sixes plus a queen, which is three of a kind, not full house. Full house would require them to have a queen (pair on board) plus a six (pair on board) => they'd need both Q and 6? Not possible. So best opponent could have is trips sixes (if they have a six) or maybe two pair (if they have something like 10-6?). Actually they could have 10-6 for full house? They would have 10 and 6, board has 10 and two sixes, they'd have three tens? No board only one ten. So not.\n\nThus our hand (two pair Qs and 6s) beats trips sixes? Actually trips sixes (three of a kind) beats two pair. So opponent could have trips sixes (if they hold a six). That beats us. Also opponent could have a higher two pair? They could have Qx with K kicker? Actually they could have QJ for two pair Q and 10? No board has 10, Q, 6, 6, 4. If they have T9 they'd have two pair tens and sixes? Actually board has ten, they have ten gives pair of tens plus pair sixes = two pair tens and sixes, which beats our queens and sixes? Compare: higher pair decides. Tens pair vs queens pair: queens higher, so our Qs and 6s beats tens and sixes. So opponent could have better two pair if they have Q with something else? They already have queen on board, they could have Q? That would be three of a kind queens? Actually board has Q, they have Q => pair queens (two queens) plus board pair sixes = two pair queens and sixes (same as us but kicker different). Our kicker K beats any other kicker. So if opponent has Qx, we tie maybe? If they have Q with K also? Not possible (we have K). So they could have QJ, they'd have Q pair same, kicker J vs K, we win.\n\nThus opponent's bet likely indicates they have a six (trips) or maybe a bluff. Since they are short stack, they might be shoving with any pair to try to double up.\n\nOur hand is decent but vulnerable to trips. We need to assess equity: If opponent has a six, probability they have a six given board: remaining deck unknown, but we can estimate. There are 2 sixes on board"

Our hand Qc Ks gives us pair of queens (queen on board + queen in hand) plus king kicker, plus the board also has a ten. So we have two pair: queens and sixes, with K kicker? Actually two pair: Qs and 6s, kicker K (since board also has Ten). So we have Q Q (pair) + 6 6 (pair). That's decent.\n\nOpponent (Seat2) bet 60 into pot 240+ previous bets? Let's compute pot: At river after turn betting: Preflop pot: blinds 1+2=3, plus raises etc. Let's compute: Preflop contributions: Seat2 raised to 6 (so 6 total?), seat3 call 6, seat4 call 5 (since they already posted small blind 1? Actually seat4 posted sb 1, seat5 posted bb 2. Preflop: seat2 raise 6 (so they put 6 total), seat3 call 6, seat4 call 5 (they had 1 posted, so add 5), seat5 call 4 (they had 2 posted, so add 2?). Wait seat5 call 4 means they put total 4? Actually they posted 2, call 4 means they add 2 more? Might be ambiguous. Anyway pot is 240 before river. Then flop: seat5 bet 12, seat2 call 12, seat3 call 12. So pot adds 12*3=36. Turn: seat5 bet 40, seat2 call 40, seat3 call 40: adds 120. So pot before river = 240 + 36 + 120 = 396? But given pot after turn maybe 240 includes those? The description says Pot: 240 chips (maybe current pot before river). Actually they list Pot: 240 chips at top of hand. That likely is pot size before river betting (i.e., after turn betting). So river: seat5 check, seat2 bet 60. So now pot is 240 + 60 = 300 (if call).

          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 7c5d, stack 398, blinds 1/2. Action: SB posted 1, BB posted 2 (our blind). No other players in hand (others folded). So we are heads-up vs SB (seat1). Amount to call is 1 (to match SB's 1). Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to total 4). Hand 7c5d is weak, low suited connectors, not a good hand for raising. Considering tournament, stack 199 BB, still deep. Should we just call and see flop? In BB, we already have 2 chips in pot; calling 1 adds 1 more to pot. With such a weak hand, it's probably best to fold or call? Since we are out of position (SB is in position after flop), calling is cheap, could see flop cheap. But 7c5d is low, could flop something but low chance. In tournament early stage, preserving chips is important but also you can see cheap flops with weak hands. Many players would just call with any two cards in BB vs SB raise of 1. But SB posted 1, not raise. So it's just a blind vs blind. Actually SB posted 1 (small blind) and BB posted 2 (big blind). No raise. So it's just a limp call. We can check (since amount to call is 1, but we already have 2 in pot, we could check? Wait we are BB, we posted 2 already, SB posted 1. The amount to call is 1 to match SB's blind? But we already have 2 in pot, to call we need to put 1 more? Actually in blind scenario, the BB can check if no raise. But the system says amount to call: 1, meaning we need to call 1 to complete the bet? But the BB already posted 2, SB posted 1, so the BB is already ahead. Typically the BB can check (i.e., no further action) if no raise. But maybe the engine treats it as we need to call the SB's 1 to make it even. But we already have 2, which is more than SB's 1, so we are effectively \"overcall\"? Actually in many implementations, after blinds posted, the action starts to the left of BB; SB posts 1, then BB posts 2. Then action goes to UTG (but all folded), so it goes to SB, who can check or raise. Since SB has no raise, they check. Then action goes to BB, who can check (i.e., no bet). So amount to call should be 0. But the system says amount to call: 1. Possibly they treat it as we need to call SB's 1 to stay even? Not typical. But given legal actions include raise, call, fold, but not check. So we must either call 1 (add 1 more chip) or raise or fold. Since we are BB, we already have 2 in pot, calling 1 would make our total contribution 3, which is more than SB's 1. That seems odd. But we follow system: amount to call is 1. So we must decide.\n\nGiven hand is weak, I'd fold rather than call extra chip? But calling 1 is cheap, could see flop cheap. Many would just call. But we might want to preserve stack? 1 chip is negligible relative to 398. So call.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

We have 397 chips. Pot is 4 chips (small). Turn is Ad, which gives opponent maybe top pair (Aces) with Kc? Actually they have unknown hand. They checked preflop and flop. Likely they have a weak hand or drawing. Our pair of 5s is weak vs potential Ace or King. But we have a decent showdown value maybe if opponent is weak. But raising could win the pot. However we need to consider tournament: we have a short stack? Not really; 198 BB is huge. So we can be aggressive.\n\nBut we have only 4 chips in pot, raise minimum is 2 (to total 2?). Actually raise_to total amount. Minimum raise to 2 means total bet 2? Usually raise must be at least double the bet? But amount to call 0, so raise to at least 2 chips (i.e., bet 2). That would be small.\n\nWe could check and see what opponent does. Given they checked flop, maybe they have a marginal hand like Ace high, or maybe a draw. If we bet, we might get a fold, winning 4 chips. Not big.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, I'd probably check and see if they bet. So action: check.\n\nThus JSON.",

So we have a pair of fives (bottom pair) with a 5 on board, plus a backdoor straight draw? 7c 5d, board Kc 8s 5c Ad. We have a pair of fives, not strong. Opponent (Seat1) bet 3 into pot 7 (pot before bet is 7). So bet 3 makes pot 10 (including bet). Call 3 gives us pot odds: 3 into 10, about 23% needed. Our hand: pair of fives, but board has K high, Ace, 8. Opponent could have Ace, King, maybe a pair, maybe a draw. Our pair is low, likely losing. Could we have any outs? We could improve to two pair (5s with board? Actually we already have a pair of fives; board has also a 5c, we have 5d, so we have a set? Wait board: Kc 8s 5c Ad. There's a 5c on board, we have 5d, so we have a pair of fives, not a set. To get a set we need a 5, but only one 5 left (5h). So one out for set. Also could get straight? With 7c and board K,8,5,A, we need 6-9? Not possible. Flush? We have 7c and board has Kc and 5c, so two clubs on board, we have a club, that's three clubs, need one more club on river. There are many clubs left. So we have backdoor flush draw (needs two clubs? Actually we have 7c, board has Kc,5c, that's three clubs, we need one more club on river to make flush. So one club on river gives us flush. That's many outs (13 clubs total, we see 3, so 10 clubs left). Also straight draw? Not really.\n\nSo total outs maybe 1 set + 10 flush = 11 outs. Approx equity ~ 11*2/47 ~ 47%? Actually each out ~2% on turn, so about 22%? Wait we are on turn, one card to river. Outs 11, chance = 11/46 \u2248 23.9%. So equity ~24% plus maybe some combos where we already have best hand (pair of fives may be best if opponent has missed). But likely opponent has better.\n\nOpponent's bet size is small, could be a probe, could be a weak Ace or king. Could be a continuation bet with Ace high. Our hand is weak. Likely fold.\n\nCheck stack: 397 chips, bet 3 is tiny. Could call and see river, but risk losing more chips if opponent bets again. Might be okay to call given cheap call, but tournament considerations: we have decent stack, but we can preserve chips. However calling 3 with such weak hand may be okay. But we could also raise to protect? No, we have weak hand, raising would be silly.\n\nThus fold? But pot odds 3 into 10, we need 23% equity. Our equity maybe ~24% if we consider flush draw + set draw. But we also have chance to be best now (maybe opponent has missed). Our equity maybe slightly above 23% borderline. But opponent's bet indicates some strength, but small bet could be a probe. Could be a bluff.\n\nGiven we have a decent chance to improve to flush (10 outs) and set (1 out). So equity maybe 24% which is just above threshold. But we also have chance to win now if opponent has missed (like missed Ace, etc). So maybe call is justified.\n\nThus call. Provide reasoning.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to 6 (so raise to 6). Could raise to 6 (i.e., raise 3 more). But raising with weak hand is not good.\n\nThus call.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Wait small blind 1 from us, big blind 2 from opponent, we called 1 to match big blind (so we put total 2). So pot 1+2+2=5? Let's compute: SB 1 from us, BB 2 from opponent, we call 1 (so we put extra 1), total contributions: us 2 (1 sb + 1 call), opponent 2 (bb). So pot =4. Then flop: both checked, no chips. Turn: opponent bet 3, we called 3, adding 6 to pot, now pot =10. River: no bets yet. So pot 10, we have two pair, opponent's range? Opponent (Seat 1) is Kimi-K2, unknown tendencies. He bet 3 on turn after checking flop. That could be a value bet with Kx, Ace, maybe a draw? Board: Kc 8s 5c Ad Kd. Turn card? Not listed. Actually board includes turn and river? The board listed is all five cards. Turn was likely something that completed board? We don't know turn card but board final includes Kc 8s 5c Ad Kd. So turn card could be Kd? Actually board includes two kings, an Ace, a 5, an 8. So turn could be Kd, river could be something else. But we don't know which came when. However opponent bet 3 on turn; after that we called. So after turn, board had maybe Kc 8s 5c Ad (four cards). Then opponent bet 3, we called. Turn card likely was Kd? If turn was Kd, board after turn: Kc 8s 5c Ad Kd (two kings, Ace, 8, 5). That would give opponent a full house possibilities. But then river would be something else not shown? Actually board listed includes river card; but we don't know order. Could be turn was something else, river something else.\n\nGiven we have two pair, opponent could have a stronger hand: a set of Kings (if he has Kx), a set of Aces (if he has A?), a full house (if he has Kx or Ax). Also could have a straight? Board: K 8 5 A K. No straight possible. Flush? No two clubs: Kc, 5c, plus maybe clubs? Our hand has 7c, so we have three clubs (Kc,5c,7c). Opponent could have two clubs for a flush if river is club? But board already has two clubs, need three clubs on board for flush, not possible. So no flush.\n\nThus opponent likely has a stronger hand if he has a King (makes trips or full house if also has another King). Or Ace (makes pair of Aces). Our two pair is moderate. We need to decide whether to bet/raise or check. Our stack is 394 chips, pot 10, we are deep.

He might be weak, but we have two pair. Raising could extract value if opponent has a weaker hand like King-high? But board has Kc and Kd, so opponent likely has at least King. If opponent has just K high (no pair), they'd have a pair of Kings (top pair) which is still better than our two pair?

Our hand currently: we have a pair of fives, but board has pair of kings (two kings) and an ace. So our best five-card hand: K K A 8 5? Actually we have 5c on board and 5d in hand, so we have trips? Wait board: Kc 8s 5c Ad Kd. That's two kings, an ace, an eight, a five. Our hand: 7c 5d. The board already has a five (5c). So we have a pair of fives (our 5d + board 5c) = pair of fives, not trips. There's also two kings on board, so the board's two pair is Kings and Fives? Actually board has K K A 8 5, that's one pair of kings, not two pair because only one five on board. So board's best is pair of kings with Ace kicker. Our hand adds a second five making a pair of fives, but we still only have pair of kings on board, we have pair of fives, but the board's pair of kings outranks our pair of fives. So we are currently behind unless we have a full house or something. We have no straight, no flush (board has clubs: Kc, 5c; we have 7c, so we have three clubs total, not flush). No straight possibilities: board ranks K,8,5,A,K. Our 7 and 5 gives possible straight 5-6-7-8-9? Not there. So we are weak.\n\nOpponent (Seat 1) bet 7 into pot 17, after we checked river. So they are betting. Likely they have a strong hand: maybe king, ace, maybe a full house (K K something). Let's consider possible holdings: They could have Kx (king) for top pair, maybe KQ, KJ, KT, KA (but board already has Ace). Actually board has Ace, so a hand with Ace could be a pair of Aces (but board already has Ace). If they have A K they'd have two pair (Aces and Kings) or maybe a full house? Let's see: board: K K A 8 5. If they have A K, they'd have two pair Aces and Kings with kicker? Actually they'd have A A K K 8 (two pair Aces and Kings). That's strong. If they have K K they'd have trips (three kings) but board already has two kings, they'd have three of a kind kings (full house? Actually three kings + Ace + 8). That's also strong. If they have 5x they'd have trips fives? No board has one five, they'd have two fives, making three of a kind fives, but still weaker than Kings. They could have a full house like K K K something? Actually need three of a kind plus a pair. If they have K K they'd have three kings (full house? Actually they'd have three kings plus Ace and 8, that's just three of a kind). To have full house they'd need board to have a pair and they have a pair: board has pair of Kings, they could have 5 5 to make full house (Kings full of Fives). But board only has one 5, they need two 5s, not possible because only one 5 left (our 5d). Actually there are four 5s total, board has 5c, we have 5d, opponent could have 5h or 5s. If they have 5h, they'd have two pair (Kings and Fives) plus Ace kicker. Not full house.\n\nFull house possibilities: Opponent could have K K (makes three Kings) but board has two Kings already, so they'd have three Kings, not full house. To have full house they'd need board to have a pair and they have a pair of a different rank. Board has pair of Kings, they could have pair of something else, e.g., 8 8 would give Kings full of eights? Actually board: K K A 8 5. If they have 8 8 they'd have Kings full of eights (KKK88). That's a full house. Similarly if they have 5 5 they'd have Kings full of fives (KKK55). Or if they have A A they'd have Aces full of Kings (AAA KK). Many possibilities. So opponent likely has strong hand.\n\nOur hand is weak. We should consider folding. However we need to consider stack sizes: we have 394 chips, opponent 199 chips"

In SB facing a 3-bet from seat2 (likely short stack? seat2 has 61 chips). Actually seat2 stack 61 chips, so they are short. They raised to 26 (13 big blinds). That's a sizable raise for a short stack; likely they are trying to go all-in or have a strong hand. Our stack is large, but we are out of position post-flop (SB will be first to act post-flop). Opponent seat2 likely is a short stack, maybe they want to steal or they have a strong hand. KTh is not a good 3-bet call vs a short stack raising big.\n\nWe could fold. Could also call? Let's consider pot odds: current pot before our decision: pot includes blinds (1+2) + our call 2 + raise 8 + re-raise 26 = 39? Actually pot shown is 39. To call 24, pot will become 63. So pot odds 24/63 = 38% to win. KTh vs unknown range of short stack's 3-bet (maybe wide but includes many strong hands). KTh off-suit likely not >38% equity vs typical 3-bet range.

Hand 7-8 offsuit is a speculative hand. In tournament, stack 196 BB, deep enough to play suited connectors, but offsuit is weaker. Position is best. Opponents' tendencies unknown.

That's a low pair, but board has two Aces, so opponent likely has Ace or better. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has been checking all streets. Preflop they called 1 (small blind) after posting SB? Wait: preflop: Seat 4 post_sb 1, Seat5 post_bb2, then seat4 call1. So MiniMax-M2 was SB, called 1 (i.e., limped). Then both checked flop, turn, river. So they have a weak hand or a draw that missed. Our hand is 3d8h, we have a pair of threes, which is likely the best hand? But board has two Aces, so any Ace in opponent's hand would give them a higher pair (pair of Aces). Also any pair of 5,6, or 3? They could have 5 or 6 for a set? But they'd have likely bet. They just checked. So likely they have nothing, maybe a low kicker, maybe a straight draw missed. So our pair of threes is likely the best. Pot is 4 chips (tiny). We have 390 chips, deep. We could check, but maybe we can try to steal a tiny amount? Minimum raise to 2, which is 2 chips total. That would be a raise of 2 (i.e., put in 2 chips). That would be a value bet of 2 into 4 pot, giving us 2 profit if called. Opponent may call with a missed draw? They might call with Ace-high? But they'd likely fold to any bet, given they checked everything. So we could raise to 2 to get a small win. However, is there any risk? If they have an Ace, they'd call and beat us. But they likely would have bet earlier. So maybe safe to check.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: we have big stack, no need to risk. Checking is fine. But a small value bet might be good to extract chips from weak draws. But the raise amount is only 2 total (i.e., you put in 2 chips). That is 50% of pot, decent. If they call, they'd lose 2 chips net. If they fold, we win 4. I'd lean to raise to 2 for value.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise_to should be total amount: 2. Reason: we have best hand, opponent likely weak, small value bet.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 2, reasoning.\n\n"

That's a low pair, but board has two Aces, so opponent likely has Ace or better. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has been checking all streets. Preflop they called 1 (small blind) after posting SB? Wait: preflop: Seat 4 post_sb 1, Seat5 post_bb2, then seat4 call1. So MiniMax-M2 was SB, called 1 (i.e., limped). Then both checked flop, turn, river. So they have a weak hand or a draw that missed. Our hand is 3d8h, we have a pair of threes, which is likely the best hand? But board has two Aces, so any Ace in opponent's hand would give them a higher pair (pair of Aces). Also any pair of 5,6, or 3? They could have 5 or 6 for a set? But they'd have likely bet. They just checked. So likely they have nothing, maybe a low kicker, maybe a straight draw missed. So our pair of threes is likely the best. Pot is 4 chips (tiny). We have 390 chips, deep. We could check, but maybe we can try to steal a tiny amount? Minimum raise to 2, which is 2 chips total. That would be a raise of 2 (i.e., put in 2 chips). That would be a value bet of 2 into 4 pot, giving us 2 profit if called. Opponent may call with a missed draw? They might call with Ace-high? But they'd likely fold to any bet, given they checked everything. So we could raise to 2 to get a small win. However, is there any risk? If they have an Ace, they'd call and beat us. But they likely would have bet earlier. So maybe safe to check.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: we have big stack, no need to risk. Checking is fine. But a small value bet might be good to extract chips from weak draws. But the raise amount is only 2 total (i.e., you put in 2 chips). That is 50% of pot, decent. If they call, they'd lose 2 chips net. If they fold, we win 4. I'd lean to raise to 2 for value.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise_to should be total amount: 2. Reason: we have best hand, opponent likely weak, small value bet.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 2, reasoning.\n\n",

Our hand QT suited? Actually Qs Td unsuited (spades and diamonds). So QT offsuit. In BB vs raise, QTo is marginal. With deep stack, could consider 3-bet as semi-bluff if we have fold equity. But position is BB out of position. Opponent is UTG? Actually seat2 is after seat1 (big blind). Seats: 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (maybe UTG?), seat2 is Kimi-K2 (maybe UTG+1). Not sure.\n\nGiven stack deep, but we are out of position, QTo is not a strong candidate to 3-bet unless we think opponent is weak and can fold. But we have limited info. Probably best to call? But calling with QTo off-suit out of position is also risky; could be dominated by better combos. Usually you fold QTo in BB vs raise unless you have a good read. So likely fold.\n\nPot odds: need to call 5 to win pot of 9+6? Actually pot currently 9 (blinds) + raise 6 = 15? Wait: preflop: seat5 post sb 1 (small blind?), seat1 post bb 2 (big blind). Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Wait they said Position: BB (Seat5). So seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? But they posted sb 1 (so seat5 posted sb 1?) That's weird. Let's interpret: seat5 posted sb 1 (so seat5 is SB) and seat1 posted bb 2 (so seat1 is BB). But they said our position BB seat5. So maybe they reversed. Anyway, the pot is 9 chips. Then seat2 raises to 6 (so adds 4 more? Actually raise to 6 means total bet 6, so call 5). So pot now 9+? The raise adds 4 extra from previous bet of 2? Hard.\n\nNevertheless, call 5 for pot ~?

Those are moderate raises, maybe they open-raise from early position? Not sure. No other info. Our hand is weak. T8 offsuit is not great for a call from BB vs raise.

Actually amount to call is 4 (the BB). So we can call 4, raise min to 8 (total). Hand Q5 offsuit is weak. Consider position: button, but short stack? Not short, 96 BB. Opponents: seat1 short (75 chips ~ 18.75 BB), seat2 medium, seat4 limped. Likely want to fold Q5. Could also raise as steal? But we have weak hand, and there are callers already. Raising could isolate and we may be out of position after flop because we are button but will be first to act after flop? Actually after raise, we would be last preflop, but flop order: SB, BB, UTG etc. Since we are button, we will act after them. But raising with Q5 is not advisable. So fold.\n\nWe need to output JSON.\n\n",

With 96 BB stack, standard raise to 3x BB = 12 is common. Minimum raise is 8 (to 8 total). Raise to 8 is a small raise, could be seen as weak. Could also just call (flat) 4, but flatting UTG is generally not advisable unless you have a strong hand. QT suited is decent but not strong enough to flat UTG. Raising is better to thin the field and get value. Opponent Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) is SB with 221 chips. Past behavior: they've raised preflop with 35 (hand 21), raised with 12 (hand 25). They also folded preflop multiple times. They called on later streets. They seem to be able to raise with decent hands, maybe medium strength. So raising to 8 (small) may invite a 3-bet? But they are short stack 221 chips, but still have enough. Our stack is 387, we could raise to say 12 (3x BB) which is above min raise. Legal actions: raise, call, fold. We can raise to any amount above min raise? Usually raise to any amount >= min raise. So we can raise to 12, 16, etc. With 96 BB, typical raise 2.5-3 BB preflop UTG = 10-12. Let's raise to 12. Reasoning: hand strength moderate, want to thin field, avoid multi-way pot. Also position early, want to be aggressive. Also tournament stack moderate, we can afford raise. So decision: raise to 12.\n\nCheck legal: raise_to = total amount we put in. Currently we need to call 4, raise to 12 means we put 12 total (including call). Good.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Hand Ah9 suited is decent but not premium. In early position? Opponent is in seat3 (UTG? Seats: seat1,2,3,4,5... we are seat5 BB, seat4 SB, seat3 is UTG? Actually seats: seat1 is under the gun? Let's assume seat3 is UTG+1 maybe. Anyway they raised 12. Should we call? A9s vs raise from early position. In tournament with 97 BB, still deep. A9s is a decent hand for a call, but also can be played 3-bet. Opponent's raise size is 12 (3BB). We could 3-bet to maybe 30-35 to isolate. But we are out of position (BB vs UTG). However A9s is not a strong hand to 3-bet out of position, but could be used as a steal if we think they are weak. Opponent's raise patterns: they've raised amounts 12, 12, 16, 18. So they sometimes raise larger. Probably a standard raise. So call is reasonable to see flop with A9s. Pot odds: call 8 to win 18+8=26 pot? Actually pot before action 18, opponent raised to 12, so pot now 18+8 (call) = 26? Wait initial pot: 2+4 =6? Actually blinds 2/4, pot 18 chips includes blinds and maybe previous? The pot listed is 18. So call 8 adds to pot making 26. So odds ~8/26 = 30.8% needed to break even. A9s vs unknown range maybe ~20% equity preflop. Might be a bit under. But could be okay to call.\n\nConsider tournament: 97 BB, we have decent stack. Could also raise to 30 to take initiative. But raising out of position with A9s might be risky; if they 4-bet, we are in trouble. But they are early and may not 4-bet often. However 4-bet range likely strong.\n\nThus likely best to call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\n",

No pair, no straight draws. Straight possibilities? Board: T,3,8,6,2. Our 9 gives potential straight 6-7-8-9-T? But we lack 7. No. Ace high. Opponent (Seat 3) bet 8 into pot 34, so pot will be 42 after call. Call 8 gives pot odds 8/(34+8)=8/42=19% approx. Need equity >19% to call. Our hand likely weak. Opponent's range: They raised preflop to 12 (3bb) from seat 3 (likely UTG? Not sure). They called our BB. So they likely have a range of strong hands: maybe broadway, pairs, suited connectors, etc. Flop and turn checks both. River bet 8 small. Could be a bluff or value with weak pair like 8,6,3,2, T? Actually board has no pair, they could have made pair on river like 8? But they'd have had pair earlier. Could be a missed draw, they might bluff. But our hand is Ace high, not likely to win. Let's consider opponent's possible holdings: Could have Ace with something, but they'd have Ace high anyway. Could have KQ, QJ, etc. Could have a missed draw like 7-9 (makes straight 6-7-8-9-T). Actually 7-9 would have made straight on river (7 on board? No 7 not on board). Straight would be 6-7-8-9-T, we have 9, board has 6,8,T, need 7. Opponent could have 7? If they have 7x, they'd have straight on river. So they'd bet for value. Our Ace high loses. Could have pair of 2,3,6,8,10. They could have 10x (makes pair of tens) they'd have top pair, they'd bet. So likely we are behind. Small bet could be a bluff with missed draws like JQ, QK, etc. But equity still low. Should we call? Maybe fold.\n\nStack: we have 381 chips, can call 8 easily.

But facing a raise from seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) with 73 chips (short stack). He is short (73 chips) relative to blinds 2/4, effective stack maybe 73. He raised to 12 (3x big blind). That is a typical raise for a short stack, maybe he is trying to steal. 7T suited is decent but not premium. Considering his short stack, he could be shoving soon. We have deep stack, can call and see flop. But we need to consider implied odds: 7T suited can flop many draws, but also can be dominated by higher suited connectors or pairs. Also his raise size is small (3x). Calling 8 is cheap. Could also raise to isolate? Raise to 20 minimum. If we raise to 20, we would be 20 total, which is 5x BB. That might isolate and we could have position preflop? Actually after raise, we would be the raiser, and then seat1 would have to act again. He may call or re-raise (unlikely). But raising might be good to get value if he has a hand like A2, K2, etc. But 7T suited is not strong enough to re-raise for value. Likely best to call and see flop. Also note his stack is short; if we call, we will have a big effective stack relative to him. He may go all-in later. But we can call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nWe need JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with 7h Ts. Board: Kd Ah 5c. Opponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, 57 chips left (short stack). He raised preflop to 12 (from 4 to 12? Actually raise to 12 total, meaning he put in 12, you called 8). So pot after preflop: 2 (SB) +4 (BB) +8 call +12 raise = 26? Wait compute: SB 2, BB 4 posted, then you call 2 (makes 4 total), seat1 raise to 12 (so adds 8 more), you call 8 (makes your total 12). So total pot = 2+4+12+12 = 30? Actually each contributed: SB 2, BB 4+8 =12, seat1 12. Sum = 2+12+12 =26? Let's recount: Preflop actions: SB (seat5) posts 2, BB (seat1) posts 4, seat2 fold, seat3 fold, seat4 fold, seat5 call 2 (so adds 2 more to make 4 total), seat1 raise 12 (so puts total 12, meaning additional 8), seat5 call 8 (adds 8 to make total 12). So contributions: seat5 total 12, seat1 total 12, plus SB 2? Wait SB is seat5, already accounted. The BB is seat1? Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, but position says \"Your Position: BB (Seat5)\". So seat1 is UTG? Actually seat1 posted BB 4, so seat1 is BB? But they said your position BB seat5. So seat1 posted BB? The description seems contradictory. However we treat seat1 as opponent who posted BB 4 then raised. So pot after preflop: seat5 (you) contributed 12, seat1 contributed 12, plus small blind? Actually small blind is you (seat5) posted 2, then called 2 to match big blind 4? Wait typical: SB 2, BB 4. You are BB, you posted 4. Then you also posted SB 2? No you can't be both. Something off. But pot given is 40 chips on flop. So pot 40 includes contributions. We'll trust pot 40.\n\nNow flop: Kd Ah 5c. You have 7h Ts, which gives you a gutshot straight draw (needs 9 for 9-T-J-Q-K? Actually board: K A 5, you have T,7. You have open-ended? Not. Straight possibilities: 9-10-J? Board has A,K,5. With T you have Broadway draw? Need Q J 9? Not. Actually you have Ten, board has Ace and King, you have gutshot to a straight with 9? Ten with Ace high no straight. So only draw is a gutshot to a straight with 9 (9-10-J-Q-K) but you need J and Q and 9, not likely. Also you have backdoor flush draw? You have hearts 7h, board has hearts? No hearts on board. So no flush draw.\n\nYour hand is basically overcards (A,K on board). You have Ten, which is lower than both. So you have basically nothing, likely losing. Opponent bet 16 into pot 40 (pot after flop before bet is 40). So bet size 16 is about 0.4 pot. You have 363 chips stack. Opponent short stack 57 chips left (including his bet?). He bet 16, so his remaining stack after bet is 57-16=41. So he is short. He may be betting as a value bet with Ace high? He might have A-K, A-x, etc. Could be a bluff? But short stack may be trying to steal or push.\n\nYour hand is weak. Likely fold. But consider pot odds: you need to call 16 to win 40+16=56 pot? Actually after call, pot would be 40+16+16=72. So you need to call 16 to win 72, odds 16/72 = 22%. Your hand's equity is likely far less than 22% (maybe 10% max). So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nWe need to output JSON.\n\n",

We are BTN, after SB and BB posted, we act. 7h8s suited? No, hearts and spades, unsuited. Off-suit 7-8. Position is best, but hand is mediocre. In tournament early stage? Stack 363 is 90 BB, deep. Opponents: seat1 95 chips (short stack), seat2 249 chips (mid). SB 95 is short; could be shoving soon. We could consider raising to isolate or call. 7-8 offsuit is a speculative hand; not great for raising but can be used to steal blinds. However there is a short stack in SB, they might call all-in if raise. But they have only 95 chips, which is about 23 BB. If we raise to 8 min raise, they'd need 4 more to call, they'd have 91 left. Could they go all-in? They could but would be risking all. Might be okay to raise to 8 (i.e., 8 total) to try to steal. But 7-8 offsuit is not strong enough to open raise? Usually you raise with a range of about 20% on button, includes suited connectors, but offsuit 7-8 is borderline. Could also just call 4, see flop cheap. Pot odds: call 4 to see flop, pot 6+4=10, effective odds 4/10 = 40% needed to break even. Hand equity vs two unknown? Might be okay to limp? But limping is suboptimal. Better to raise or fold. Considering short stack SB might fold to raise, BB may call. If we raise to 8, we risk facing 4 from BB (call) and 4 from SB (call) making pot 6+8+4+4 = 22. Our equity with 7-8 offsuit vs two random hands maybe ~30%? Not enough. So maybe fold. However we could also just call 4 and see flop cheap, maybe hit straight draws.\n\nGiven we have deep stack, we can afford to see flop. But calling 4 adds 4 to pot, we have 363 left.

          "reasoning_content": "We have 7h8s on BTN, facing a raise to 12 (from 4 to 12? Actually raise amount is 12 total? The raise is 12 chips total, meaning they put in 12? The amount to call is 8 (they raised 12, you called 4 initially). So you need to call 8 to see flop. Minimum raise to 20 (so raise would be to 20 total). Stack 359, deep.\n\n7-8 suited is a decent speculative hand, especially in position, but it's not a premium hand. In a tournament with 89.8 BB, you can be a bit aggressive but need to consider opponent Kimi-K2's tendencies. From recall: Kimi-K2 has raised 12 in hand 31,32,33. In hand 33 they raised 75 (big raise). So they may be capable of larger raises, but also they folded many preflop raises? Actually they raised 12 three times, but also folded many times preflop (folded in earlier hands). So they may be a tight-ish player who raises when they have decent hands. 7-8 suited is marginal; calling a raise of 12 (3x BB) is okay in position, but could be risky if they are tight. However 7-8 suited can flop well, and you have implied odds. Stack depth is high, can call.\n\nPot odds: pot currently 18 + 12 (their raise) + 4 (your call) = 34? Actually after raise, pot is 18 (original) + 12 (raise) + 4 (your call) = 34. To call 8, you invest 8 to win 34 (including your 8). So pot odds = 8/(34) = 23.5% needed. 7-8 suited has about 12% chance to hit a flush draw, etc. Might be okay.\n\nGiven position and hand, calling is reasonable. Raising would be too aggressive, likely not good.\n\nThus action: call.\n\n",

So they raise relatively small amounts, maybe open-raise standard. No info about fold frequency.\n\nJc9s suited? Actually Jc9s is unsuited (clubs and spades). So offsuit. It's a marginal hand. In BB vs a raise from MP? Seat3 likely is MP (position after SB, BB). So they are in early position (maybe UTG?). Actually seat numbers: seat1 is UTG? Not sure. But seat3 is after seat2 (who folded). Could be UTG+1. So they raise from early position, indicating a tighter range. Jc9 offsuit is weak. Should fold.\n\nStack 347, 86 BB, but still early tournament, preserve chips.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #39 preflop. Position SB. Our cards Jd Ad (Ace-Jack offsuit). Stack 345 chips (86.2 BB). Blinds 2/4. Pot currently 56 (SB posted 2, BB posted 4, plus raises). Actions: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, Seat2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (so min raise to 12?). Actually raise from 4 to 12 is raise of 8, but they call it raise 12 (total). Then Seat3 folded, Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 38. So they re-raised (3-bet) to 38. Amount to call is 36 (i.e., need to add 36 more to match 38, because we already posted 2). Minimum raise to: 64 (so if we raise, must raise to at least 64 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call 38, or raise to at least 64. Hand is AJo in SB facing a 3-bet from MiniMax-M2 (seat4) after a raise from Kimi-K2 (seat2). Stack sizes: Kimi-K2 253 chips, MiniMax-M2 135 chips, us 345, BB seat1 91 chips.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall MiniMax-M2 raise patterns: only one raise found: hand 14 preflop raise amount 4 (tiny raise). That's not much info. Kimi-K2 raise patterns: many raises of 12, 18, 26, etc. Not huge.\n\nWe have limited info. Our hand AJo is decent but not premium. In SB, out of position. Facing 3-bet from MiniMax-M2 with 135 chips (approx 33 BB). They could be shoving? Actually they raised to 38, which is about 9.5 BB (since big blind is 4). 38/4 = 9.5 BB. That's a sizable 3-bet.\n\nOur stack 86 BB, we could call 36 more (to 38 total). That would be about 9.5 BB call, leaving us with ~76 BB after call. Is that advisable? AJo vs unknown range. Could be okay to call if we think they are 3-betting light. But being out of position, maybe better to fold unless we have a good read.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 only one raise recorded (4). That suggests they rarely 3-bet? Could be that they are tight and only raise small amounts. But we have no info on their 3-bet frequency.\n\nKimi-K2's raise to 12 (initial raise). They are medium stack 253. Their raise size 12 (3 BB). That's a standard open.\n\nMiniMax-M2's 3-bet to 38 is large (approx 9.5 BB). Could be a strong hand (AA, KK, AK, maybe AQ). Our AJo is not top 5% but still decent.\n\nWe also have to consider tournament: stack 86 BB, not short. Could afford to fold.\n\nThus likely fold.\n\nBut also could consider calling and seeing flop, but out of position.\n\nGiven limited info, I'd fold.\n\nLet's produce JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop with 9h Jh on button, stacks: us 345, SB 2, BB 4, others folded. Opponent seats: seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is SB with 89 chips, seat2 (Kimi-K2) is BB with 249 chips.\n\nWe are BTN, after SB and BB posted, it's our turn. Amount to call is 4 (BB). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to total 8). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand: 9h Jh \u2013 suited connectors, decent hand on button, can open raise. Stack 86 BB, deep enough. Opponents: SB (89 chips, 22.25 BB) is short stack; BB (249 chips, 62 BB). Need to consider opponent tendencies: recall shows seat1 (SB) raised preflop in some past hands, amounts 6,12,12,16,12. So they are aggressive, maybe 3-bet? In those hands they raised from SB (post sb 2) to amount 6 (i.e., raise to 6) which is 3x SB? Actually raise to 6 means they raised to total 6, so 4 over call. That's a 3-bet? Wait initial bet is BB 4, call would be 4, raise to 8 minimum. So raise to 6 is below min raise? Not possible. Maybe they raised from SB after posting 2, before BB? Actually order: SB posts 2, then BB posts 4, then action goes to UTG etc. But in this scenario, only SB and BB present. But recall may be from other tables where there were more players; anyway SB shows raises preflop, maybe 3-bets or open raises.\n\nSeat2 (BB) no data. Might be tighter.\n\nGiven we are on button, 9hJh is a good raise. Also we have a short stack behind (SB 89 chips). If we raise to 8, SB may call or shove (since 89 chips). 8 is small relative to SB's stack, they could go all-in. But raising too small may invite call and we might get in a multiway pot with a weak hand vs stronger ranges. However 9hJh is decent for 3-bet? Could also consider 3-bet (re-raise) to isolate SB? But we are first to act after blinds, so it's open raise. Could also consider a limp? Not advisable with suited connectors.\n\nThus raise to 8 (minimum raise) seems fine. Reason: we want to build pot, take advantage of position, and pressure short stack.\n\nCheck if we can raise more. Minimum raise 8, we could raise to e.g., 15. But deeper stacks can call, but we might want to size to isolate SB. SB has 89 chips, they'd likely call a raise of 15? Might still call. A larger raise might discourage call but also risk being re-raised by BB (big stack) who could have a strong hand.\n\nGiven tournament early stage, we can raise to 12 (3x BB) to apply pressure. But legal minimum raise is 8, we can raise higher. However we need to consider pot odds: if BB calls, we will be in 3-way with 9hJh vs unknown ranges. Might be okay.\n\nGiven our hand is decent but not premium, a standard raise to 8 (2x BB) is fine to see flop.\n\nThus choose raise to 8.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

Hand is suited broadway, decent but not premium. Stack is decent. Opponents: seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised previously? Actually actions: seat3 posted small blind 4, seat4 posted big blind 8. So we are first to act after blinds? UTG is seat5, after SB and BB, action goes to UTG first. So amount to call is 8 (big blind). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek raises often preflop with amounts 12,16,18,32. That's about 1.5-4 BB raises (big blind 8). So they raise larger sometimes. They are seat3 (SB) but not relevant now. MiniMax seat4 is BB, hasn't acted yet. We are UTG. Should we open raise? Standard UTG open range is tight: maybe top 10%: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ. KJ suited is borderline, often not opened UTG in tournament early stages, especially with 44 BB stack? Might be okay to limp? But limp (call) is not recommended in early position; better to fold or raise. Since we have 44 BB, we could raise to 3-4 BB (24-32). Minimum raise is 16 (2 BB). Could raise to 24 (3 BB). That would be standard.\n\nBut consider stack depth: 44 BB, we could open for 3 BB to build pot. Opponents may call or re-raise. Our hand has good equity vs many hands, especially suited. Could also consider 3-bet if someone raises, but no raise yet.\n\nThus decision: raise to 24 (3 BB). Reason: decent hand, position early, want to thin field, build pot, have enough stack.\n\nCheck if any reason to fold: KJs is not premium UTG but still playable. In tournament early, we might be cautious. But with 44 BB, we can afford to open.\n\nThus action: raise to 24.",

So we are first to act on flop (since we are BB, but preflop we raised, now flop we act first). Board: 9s 3d 8h. Our hand: Ks Js. So we have open-ended straight draw (7-10). Actually we have gutshot? Let's see: board 9,3,8. We have K,J. Straight possibilities: 7-8-9-10-J gives us gutshot? Actually we have J, board has 9 and 8, missing 10 for open-ended? We have J, need 10 for straight J-10-9-8-7? Wait need 7-8-9-10-J. We have J, board 8,9, need 7 and 10. That's two outs for open-ended? Actually we have two ways: need 7 or 10. So we have 8 outs (four 7s and four 10s) = 8 outs. That's decent.\n\nWe also have backdoor flush draws? Suits: board spade 9s, hearts 8h, diamonds 3d. Our hand: Ks (spade), Js (spade). So we have two spades, board has one spade, so we have a flush draw with 2 spades in hand, need two more spades on turn and river. That's 9 outs (remaining spades = 11? Actually there are 13 spades total, we have 2, board has 1, so 10 left. But two needed, probability lower). So decent equity.\n\nPot is 60, we have 327 stack. Opponent stack 221. No bet yet on flop. We can check or bet/raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise (minimum raise to 16). Since we are first to act, we can bet (raise). Should we bet? With open-ended straight draw and flush draw, we have decent equity, but we also have backdoor possibilities. Opponent may have made a pair (9,8,3) etc. We could bet to protect and build pot. Our stack is decent relative to pot. Minimum raise 16, which is 2.5BB? Actually blind 4/8, raise to 24 preflop, pot 60 includes our raise (24+24+8?). Let's compute: preflop: SB 4, BB 8, we raise to 24, opponent calls 24. So pot after preflop = 4+8+24+24 = 60. Yes.\n\nNow flop: we can bet 16 (to 76 total). That is about 1/3 pot. That could be a continuation bet. Our hand has good draw, we want to see cheap turn. Betting also protects against draws. Opponent may call with any pair, or raise with strong. We have decent stack, can call raise.\n\nGiven tournament stage (we have 40 BB, opponent 27.6 BB). We want to preserve chips but also accumulate. I think a continuation bet of 16 is good.\n\nThus action: raise to 76? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raise to 16 means total bet of 16? Minimum raise to 16 means we need to put 16 chips total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in, not additional. Since no bet, raise to 16 means we bet 16 chips. But is that allowed? Minimum raise to 16, so we can raise to 16. That would be a small bet ~0.27 pot. Might be too small. But we can raise more, up to any amount. Maybe raise to 30? Let's choose raise to 30 (approx half pot). That is a decent continuation bet.\n\nCheck? Could also check to see opponent's action, but we have strong draw, we want to get value if opponent has pair. But also risk of giving free cards. I think bet.\n\nThus output: raise to 30.\n\nReasoning: open-ended straight draw, flush draw, want to build pot, protect, etc.\n\n"

          "reasoning_content": "We have turn. Board: 9s 3d 8h 5s. Our hand: K\u2660 J\u2660. So we have gutshot straight draw? Board: 9-8-5-3. We have KJ, no pair, no flush draw (two spades on board? board has spade 9 and spade 5, we have spade K and J, so we have 4 spades total, need one more for flush, but there are 2 spades on board, we have 2 spades, that's 4 spades, need 1 more for flush, but only one more spade on board? Actually board spades: 9s, 5s. Our spades: K\u2660, J\u2660. So we have 4 spades total, need one more spade on river to make flush. Straight draw? We have KJ, board 9-8-5-3. If a 7 appears, we get 5-7-8-9? Actually need 7 for 5-6-7-8-9? Not. Straight possibilities: 7 would give 5-6-7-8-9? No 6 missing. 6 would give 5-6-7-8-9? No 7 missing. So no straight draw. So currently we have high cards, K high, J kicker. Opponent seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has called preflop and flop. Pot is 120. Turn action: we are in BB, we acted preflop raise, flop bet, opponent called. Now turn: amount to call 0, so we are first to act? Actually after flop, opponent called, now turn action: it's our turn? Since we are seat 5 (BB) and opponent seat 2 is after us? The order: seat 5 (us) raised preflop, seat 2 called, flop bet by us, seat 2 called, now turn. So it's our turn to act first (since we were first to bet flop). So we have option to check or raise. Opponent's stack 191, ours 297. Opponent's tendencies unknown. Should we bet? We have no made hand, only potential flush draw. Might be a good spot to bluff? Turn board: 9s 3d 8h 5s. It's a relatively dry board, no pairs on board, no straight possibilities. Opponent likely has a hand like 9x, 8x, 5x, maybe a pair. Could be a weak hand. We could attempt a continuation bet (c-bet) to take pot. Our raise would be minimum raise to 30 (i.e., raise to 30 total? Actually minimum raise to 30 means raise amount total 30? The legal raise amount: currently amount to call 0, so we can bet 30 (minimum raise). So we could bet 30. That would be 30 into 120 pot, about 1/4 pot. That seems small. Might be okay as a probe. But we could also check and see river. Considering tournament, we have decent stack 37 BB, not short. Might want to preserve chips. Opponent may have called flop with a marginal hand, but we could try to take pot now. The opponent's previous actions: they called our flop bet, indicating maybe they have a hand that likes board (maybe a 9, 8, 5, or a gutshot). Could be a pair of 9s? But board no pair. Could be a straight draw like 7-6? Actually board 9-8-5-3, 7-6 would give 5-6-7-8-9, yes that is a straight! Wait we have 5-8-9, missing 6 and 7. So 7-6 would give straight. So opponent could have 7-6. They called flop bet with that draw? Possibly. So they might have a draw. Our raise may push them out. But we also have a flush draw, but not strong. Might consider check to see river card. River could be spade for flush, or 7/6 for straight. But we don't have any pair, so maybe check.\n\nGiven the situation, likely best to check, see river, then decide. The pot is 120, we have 297 left. Checking is safe.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nWe need JSON with raise_to null.\n\n",

Since SB just called, they likely have a wide range (maybe any pair, suited connectors, etc). Raising to 16 (8 more) is small, could be a standard raise. If they call, we see flop.

The highest club on board is Kc, we have Tc, so we have the nut flush draw (Ace-high flush not possible because Ace not on board; we have Ten of clubs, board Kc and 6c, we need any club higher than Ten? Actually flush draws: we need 5 clubs. Currently we have two clubs (Kc, 6c, Tc). Need 2 more clubs. The highest possible flush would be Ace-high, but we have Ten, so the best possible flush we could make is Ten-high? Wait flush ranking uses highest card in flush.

Opponent may have Kx, or a draw. Checking might allow free cards, but also gives opponent chance to check-raise? Not likely.\n\nGiven pot 16, we could bet ~ half pot (8) to build pot and protect. Minimum raise is 8 (to total 8). We can raise to 8 (i.e., bet 8). That seems good. Opponent's stack is 175, can call.\n\nWe should consider tournament stage: we have 36 BB, comfortable.

Actually we have J (board), T (our), 9, 8, 7 would be a straight, but we don't have 8. So we have gutshot: need a Queen for straight (Q T J 9 8? Wait need Q? Let's check combos: With T and K, we can make a straight if board runs 9, J, Q, K, A? No. Actually we have K and T. Board: J,9,7. To have straight we need either 8 and Q (8-9-10-J-Q) or Q and 8? Wait we have T, so 8-9-10-J-Q would be a straight using our T and board 9,J, plus need 8 and Q. That's two cards needed, not a draw. Another possibility: 10-J-Q-K-A? That's a straight using T,J, K, plus need Q and A. Also two cards. So we have no immediate straight draw, just a gutshot? Let's enumerate possibilities for a straight with our cards: We have K and T.\n\nPotential straights:\n- 9-10-J-Q-K: we have 10,J,K need Q. That's a gutshot (need Q). So we need Q on turn or river to make straight.\n- 10-J-Q-K-A: need Q and A (two cards) not possible now.\n- 7-8-9-10-J: we have 10,J,9,7 need 8. That's a gutshot needing 8.\nThus we have two gutshots: need Q or 8. Actually both are possible: 8 would give us 7-8-9-10-J straight; Q would give 9-10-J-Q-K straight. So two outs each? Actually 4 Qs and 4 8s = 8 outs (but some may be blocked by opponent's cards). So we have 8 outs.\n\nWe have a gutshot draw (8 outs) and also a backdoor flush? Suits: our hearts: Kh, Ts (spade). Board: 9c,7s,Js (spade). We have one spade (Ts). So we have two spades after flop? Actually board has Js (spade) and 7s (spade). So there are already two spades on board. We have Ts spade, so we have three spades. Need one more spade for flush draw (4 spades). So we have a backdoor flush draw (needs two more spades). Not immediate.\n\nOur hand currently is just high card King (with Ten). Board shows Jack high. So we are currently behind any Jack, any pair on board, etc. Opponent seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) bet 20 into pot 60 (so pot now 80 after call). Pot odds: need to call 20 to win 80+20? Actually current pot is 60, opponent bet 20, so total pot after call would be 80 (60+20). Call 20 to win 80, odds 2.5:1, about 28.6% needed. Our outs 8, plus maybe some combos. Approx chance to hit on turn or river? With two cards to come, chance of hitting one of 8 outs by river: probability = 1 - ( (45-8)/45 * (44-8)/44 ) = 1 - (37/45 * 36/44) = 1 - (0.8222 * 0.8182) = 1 - 0.672 = 0.328 approx 32.8%. That's above 28.6%, so calling is +EV. However we need to consider opponent's range and potential that they have made a hand already (pair, two pair, etc). Also we have only 277 chips, 34.6 BB, not huge but decent. Opponent's stack is 187 chips (22.9 BB). So they are also short. Their bet 20 is about 10% of their stack. They could be betting as a continuation with overpair (like AQ, KQ, etc). Our hand is weak.\n\nWe could also consider raising. Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise to 40 total). That would be 20 more than call. Raise sizing? If we raise to 40, we would be putting 40 total, i.e., an additional 20 beyond call. That would be a 2x bet. Might be a semi-bluff, leveraging our draw. Does opponent likely call? Might fold weaker hands. Could we get value"

Actually we have 9-10-J, missing 8 or Q for straight. With K T, we have a gutshot to 8 (8-9-10-J) or Q (9-10-J-Q). So two outs each? Actually 8 gives straight 8-9-10-J, need 8. Q gives 9-10-J-Q. So 8 and Q each 4 outs = 8 outs. Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Board has two spades (7s,4s). Our hand has no spade, so no flush draw.\n\nWe have top pair? No, we have King high, board has J as top pair for opponent maybe. We have K kicker but no pair. So currently we are behind most hands except maybe Ace-high, or maybe opponent has J (pair) etc. The opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 20 on flop, we called. Now on turn, board added 4s. Opponent's action? It's our turn now, we have amount to call 0 (meaning opponent hasn't bet yet on turn). The legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 20 (so raise must be at least 20 total). The pot is 80 (includes flop bet 20 each? Let's compute: Preflop: pot 4+8+16+12? Actually preflop: SB 4, BB 8, raise to 16, call 12 (so total preflop pot: 4+8+16+12 = 40). Flop: opponent bet 20, we called 20, pot adds 40, now pot 80. Turn: no bet yet. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need to decide: With K T, we have gutshot draws (8 outs) and some equity. Opponent's range: they raised preflop from UTG? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, they raised to 16 from UTG? Position unknown but likely early. They could have a wide range: any pair, broadways, suited connectors, etc. Flop board 9c 7s Js. They bet 20, we called. That bet size is small relative to pot (20 into 40). Could be continuation bet with many hands: any J, any 9, any 7, overpairs, combos, etc. They might have Jx, 9x, 7x, A? They might also have draws.\n\nNow turn is 4s.

But we have only gutshot; raising could be risky because we may get called by stronger.\n\nGiven stack 257, pot 80, we could check and fold to raise later.

Actually we have 9-10-J, missing 8 or Q for straight. With K T, we have a gutshot to 8 (8-9-10-J) or Q (9-10-J-Q). So two outs each? Actually 8 gives straight 8-9-10-J, need 8. Q gives 9-10-J-Q. So 8 and Q each 4 outs = 8 outs. Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Board has two spades (7s,4s). Our hand has no spade, so no flush draw.\n\nWe have top pair? No, we have King high, board has J as top pair for opponent maybe. We have K kicker but no pair. So currently we are behind most hands except maybe Ace-high, or maybe opponent has J (pair) etc. The opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 20 on flop, we called. Now on turn, board added 4s. Opponent's action? It's our turn now, we have amount to call 0 (meaning opponent hasn't bet yet on turn). The legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 20 (so raise must be at least 20 total). The pot is 80 (includes flop bet 20 each? Let's compute: Preflop: pot 4+8+16+12? Actually preflop: SB 4, BB 8, raise to 16, call 12 (so total preflop pot: 4+8+16+12 = 40). Flop: opponent bet 20, we called 20, pot adds 40, now pot 80. Turn: no bet yet. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need to decide: With K T, we have gutshot draws (8 outs) and some equity. Opponent's range: they raised preflop from UTG? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, they raised to 16 from UTG? Position unknown but likely early. They could have a wide range: any pair, broadways, suited connectors, etc. Flop board 9c 7s Js. They bet 20, we called. That bet size is small relative to pot (20 into 40). Could be continuation bet with many hands: any J, any 9, any 7, overpairs, combos, etc. They might have Jx, 9x, 7x, A? They might also have draws.\n\nNow turn is 4s. This changes board: adds a spade, but we have no spade. Could give flush draws to opponent if they have two spades. Could also complete some straight draws: 8 would give straight 8-9-10-J, but 4 doesn't help. So our outs remain 8.\n\nPot odds: If we raise, we need to consider if we can get value from worse hands (like Jx, 9x, etc). We have no pair, so likely we are behind many hands.

Our hand: K\u2665 T\u2660. We have straight draw? Let's evaluate: Board has J, 9, 7, 4, 2. Our hand K T gives us gutshot? Actually we have K T, board has J, 9, 8? No 8 missing. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q? Not there. Our hand could make a straight with Q? If we had Q, we would have 9-10-J-Q-K? Actually we have K T, need Q and 9? We have 9 on board, T in hand, J board, K hand, that would be 9-10-J-Q-K missing Q. So not a straight. Also could have 8-9-10-J? Need 8 and we have K,T. Not.\n\nWe have K high, T kicker. No pair on board (no pair). Board is rainbow except three spades? Actually spades: 7\u2660, J\u2660, 4\u2660. So three spades on board. We have T\u2660, giving us a flush draw? We have one spade in hand (T\u2660). Board has three spades, need 5 spades for flush, need two more spades; we only have one, so no flush.\n\nWe have pair? No. So we have just king high, which is weak.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) actions: preflop raise to 16, we called. Flop: they bet 20, we called. Turn: they checked, we checked. River: amount to call 0, they have option to raise (minimum raise 20). So they have checked on turn, now on river we have check, they could bet/raise. We have legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call 0, check is allowed.\n\nWe need to decide whether to check or raise (or possibly fold, but we can't fold when checking? Actually we can fold if we think they'd bet, but currently it's our turn and amount to call is 0, so we can check. If we raise, we bet into them.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, MiniMax-M2's actions: they have raised preflop occasionally (hand 39 raise 38, hand 47 raise 40). They also called preflop with small amounts. On flop, they bet 20 (this hand) and previously bet 8 (hand 44) and 10 (hand 48). On turn, they checked (this hand) and previously bet 8 (hand 44) and maybe other actions.\n\nThus they may be capable of continuation bet on flop, then check turn if missed. River we have to decide.\n\nOur hand is weak; we likely should check and possibly fold to a bet later. But we have the option to raise as bluff. Evaluate stack: we have 257 chips, pot 80. Minimum raise is 20 (to 20?). Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 20 would be a bet of 20. That would be 20 into 80 pot, pot becomes 100. That's about 20% pot. Might be a small bluff.\n\nOpponent's tendencies: they have checked turn, maybe they have missed. Could they be weak? They could have a hand like Jx, 9x, etc. Board is 9-7-J-4-2. They could have J? They might have J? They raised preflop, so they likely have a strong hand preflop. Could be broadway combos like AQ, AK, KQ, etc. After flop J appears, they bet 20 (small). Could be they have J high, maybe a pair of J. Turn check suggests maybe they missed or have marginal.\n\nWe have K T, which doesn't improve. So likely we are behind. Best is to check and be prepared to fold if they bet.\n\nBut could we attempt a steal? Since they checked turn, maybe they are weak. Our raise of 20 might be a small value bet to take pot. But with king high, we risk being called and losing more chips. Our stack is decent (32 BB). Losing 20 chips is okay if we think we can win later.\n\nBetter to check and see if they bet; if they bet we can fold.\n\nThus choose \"check\". Reasoning: weak hand, board not connecting, opponent likely ahead, better to check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on river: opponent (MiniMax-M2) bets 30 into pot 110 (so pot becomes 140). Our hand: Kh Ts. Board: 9c 7s Js 4s 2c. So we have King high, plus gutshot? Actually we have straight draw? Board: 9-J-7-4-2. Our hand: K T. We have Ten, King. That gives us a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: 9-10-J would be a straight (9-10-J-Q-K?). Actually a straight needs five consecutive cards. With board 9-7-J-4-2, we have 9,7,J,4,2. Ten would give us 9-10-J, but need also Q and K? No, need five cards. Ten with board gives 9-10-J (three consecutive). Not a straight. King is high, no pair. So we have just King high. Opponent could have many hands: maybe a pair, two pair, straight draws, flush draws? Board has two spades (7s,4s). No flush possible because we have no spade. Opponent could have a straight: 8-6? 6-8 would make 6-7-8-9-10? Actually board has 9 and 7, so 8-6 gives 6-7-8-9-? Need 10? Not present. 8-6 gives 6-7-8-9, missing 5 or 10. Not a straight. 8-5 gives 5-6-7-8-9? No 6. So possible straight combos: 8-10? That would be 7-8-9-10-J? Board has 7,9,J, we have 10? Actually opponent could have 8-10 making straight 7-8-9-10-J (but board lacks 10). So not possible. 10-8 would need 10 on board, not there. 8-6? Not. So only possible straight on board is if opponent holds 8-6? That would give 6-7-8-9-? Need 10? Not. So no straight possible except maybe using Ace? Ace high? Not. So likely opponent has a pair or two pair, maybe a set? Board has no pair, but could have a pair like 9x9, 7x7, JxJ. Could have a pair of Jacks: Jx? Actually board has J, so a pocket J gives trips. Also could have a pair of 9s or 7s. Could have a straight draw missed, but they bet. Could also have a flush draw? Board spades: 7s,4s. Only two spades, need three spades in hand to have a flush, not possible. So flush not. So opponent likely has a made hand (pair or two pair) or a bluff.\n\nOur stack 257, we have 30 to call, pot 110 + 30 = 140 after call (if call). So pot odds: need to call 30 to win 140 => 21.4% equity needed. We have almost zero chance vs made hand. So folding is likely correct.\n\nBut we need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, MiniMax-M2 sometimes raises preflop, sometimes bets small on flop/turn. In recent hands: hand 44 turn bet 8 (small) after checking flop. Hand 48 flop bet 10 after calling preflop. So they are somewhat aggressive but also can bet small. In this hand, they bet 30 on river after checking turn. That's a larger bet (about 27% of pot). Could be a value bet with a pair or two pair. Our hand is weak. So fold.\n\nWe must output JSON with action \"fold\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Seat2 (Kimi-K2) larger stack, folds often, occasional raise to 24. Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) folds preflop always in data (maybe tight). Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) sometimes raises (40, 16) and calls; seems more aggressive.\n\nOur UTG open: T\u2663J\u2663 is a decent hand but not great to open UTG in a 8-handed tournament. However stack 32 BB, we can open for 2.5 BB (20) or 3 BB (24). The minimum raise is 16; raising to 20-24 is okay.\n\nGiven opponents: Seat1 likely folds unless short stack maybe raise; Seat2 may call or raise; Seat3 folds; Seat4 may raise if we raise.\n\nIf we just call 8 (i.e., limp) that's generally suboptimal UTG; we could limp and hope to see cheap flop but will be out of position and vulnerable to raises.\n\nBetter to raise to 20-24 to thin field and get value from suited connectors, also protect against 3-bets? But we could be 3-bet by MiniMax-M2 (who raised 40 previously). With 32 BB, 40 raise would be > our stack; but that's previous hand.\n\nOur raise size: typical 2.5-3 BB = 20-24. Let's choose raise to 24 (3 BB). This is within legal (minimum 16). It puts pressure on short stacks and maybe gets call from deeper players with decent hands.\n\nConsider pot odds: If we raise to 24, pot becomes 12+8+24 = 44? Actually initial pot 12 (blinds). We call 8? Wait we raise to 24, we put 24 total (including call of 8). So we add 16 more. New pot = 12 + 24 = 36? Actually before our action, we have posted small blind? No, we are UTG seat5, not blind. So pot is 12 (SB+BB). We raise to 24, meaning we put 24 chips. So total pot = 12 + 24 = 36. Opponents will need to call 24.\n\nGiven our hand, it's okay.\n\nThus action: raise to 24.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand: BB with Tc Jc, 29.1 BB. Preflop: SB (seat3) posted 4, BB (seat4) posted 8, we raised to 24 (so we open-raise 16 over BB). Then seat1 and 2 fold, seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) re-raises to 107 (so 3-bet). Now we face a 3-bet of 107, we have called 24 already, need to call additional 83 to 107. Minimum raise to 190 (so raise would be to 190 total). Opponent stack is 4 chips? Wait seat3 has 4 chips? Actually seat3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 4 chips. That's their stack size? It says 4 chips, so they are extremely short-stacked (4 chips). But they posted SB 4, so they are at 4 chips total? That seems they are on the brink, maybe they are effectively all-in? The raise to 107 is larger than their stack, but they can only raise up to their stack (4 chips). Something inconsistent: maybe they have 4 chips left after posting SB, but they raised to 107 meaning they are going all-in for 107? Actually if they have 4 chips, they cannot raise to 107. So maybe the data: seat3 has 4 chips (they are short). They posted SB 4, then they raise to 107, meaning they are effectively all-in for 107, which is more than they have, but maybe they are allowed to bet all-in for remaining chips (4). But raise amount 107 seems unrealistic. Could be a misprint: maybe seat3 has 311 chips? No seat2 has 311. seat3 is 4 chips, maybe they are the \"DeepSeek-V3.2\" with 4 chips, they are short. The raise to 107 is a big raise, maybe they have 107 chips after posting SB? Actually they posted 4, so remaining 0? This is confusing.\n\nNevertheless, we need to decide action: call 83 to 107, raise to 190 (minimum raise), or fold.\n\nOur hand: Tc Jc, suited connector, decent but not premium. Against a short stack 3-bet, they might be shoving all-in with a wide range. Our stack 233, we can call 83 to see flop, but risk losing 83 chips if we lose. In tournament, we have 29 BB, not short, but we want to preserve chips. However, if opponent is short-stacked and likely all-in, we can call with decent equity. TcJc vs unknown short stack range: likely they have strong hands (AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe some suited connectors). Our equity maybe around 30-35% vs that range. Pot odds: pot currently 139, opponent adds 107 making pot 246? Actually pot after raise: initial pot 139 (includes blinds and our raise). Then opponent raises to 107 (adds 83). So pot is 139 + 83 = 222? Wait preflop pot: blinds 4+8=12, our raise to 24 adds 16 extra (so total pot 12+24? Actually we put 24, they put 4+8? Let's compute: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, we raise to 24 (so we put 24 total, meaning we added 16). So pot after our raise = 4+8+24 = 36. Then seat1,2 fold. Then seat3 raises to 107 (adds 83 more). So pot = 36 + 83 = 119. Actually also includes their original 4? Already counted. So pot now 119. We need to call 83 to win 119. Pot odds: need to call 83 to win 119, so odds = 83/(119+83) = 83/202 \u2248 41%. So need >41% equity to be profitable. Our equity vs their range maybe 30-35%, not enough. So fold is correct.\n\nBut if they are short stack and likely all-in, we may consider calling if we have decent equity and can win chips. However pot odds 41% is high. Our hand is not strong enough. So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: recall shows they often fold preflop, occasionally raise small amounts (12, 32). Not much info. But they are short stack, may be desperate.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to respond with correct JSON. Need to decide action. Hand: BB with TcJc, raise 24 (3BB) then 3-bet to 107 from Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) after initial raise? Actually preflop: seat3 posted SB 4, seat4 posted BB 8, seat5 raise 24 (our raise). Then seat3 raise 107 (so a 3-bet). Now we face 83 to call, min raise to 190. Stack 233. Our hand is suited JTs. In BB position, we raised first, then got 3-bet. With 29 BB stack, we could consider 4-bet all-in? Stack 233, min raise 190, all-in is 233. JcTc suited is decent for 4-bet vs 3-bet from unknown opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2). But they have 4 chips? Actually seat3 has 4 chips (they are short stack). Wait seat3 stack is 4 chips, so they are effectively all-in for 4? But they raised to 107, but they only have 4 chips? That seems contradictory: seat3 has 4 chips total, cannot raise to 107. Maybe the data: seat3 is 4 chips total, but they posted SB 4, so they are short-stacked and went all-in for 4? The raise to 107 may be a mistake. However we must treat as given: seat3 raise 107, meaning they have enough chips. But their stack is 4? That's impossible. Probably seat3 is short stack and is all-in for 4, but the raise amount shown is 107 (maybe total pot after raise?). Might be a bug. Let's assume seat3 is short stack and is all-in for 4 chips. But amount to call is 83, min raise 190. If they are all-in for 4, we could just call 4? But amount to call is 83, which is larger. Something off.\n\nGiven situation, we have 29 BB, opponent is deep (311 chips). Actually seat2 has 311 chips but folded. So seat3 has 4 chips but they raised to 107? Maybe seat3 is 4 chips after posting SB, they are short and cannot raise. So maybe seat3 is actually DeepSeek-V3.2 with 311 chips? No seat2 is Kimi-K2 with 311 chips. So seat3 has 4 chips; they cannot raise. So maybe it's a misprint. We should treat as a legitimate 3-bet to 107. Our hand JcTc is a good 4-bet candidate vs 3-bet from unknown opponent, especially with 29 BB. The raise to 190 would be 190 total, leaving us 233-190=43 chips left, not all-in. Could also go all-in 233. Considering tournament, we have medium stack, could 4-bet all-in to apply pressure, but JcTc is not premium, but it's a good hand for 4-bet vs 3-bet, especially against unknown opponent. However 4-bet all-in could be risky vs a strong range. Might be better to call and see flop? But calling 83 puts us with 150 chips left, still decent. But we are out of position after call (still BB). The opponent's 3-bet range likely includes strong combos, but also some bluffs. JcTc has ~35% equity vs typical 3-bet range. The pot after call would be 139+24+107+83 = 353? Actually pot currently 139, we raised 24, opponent 107, now call 83 makes pot ~139+24+107+83 = 353. Our equity 35% gives expected value = 0.35*353 = 124 > 83 call, so positive. So call is okay. Raising to 190 (4-bet) would be aggressive, but we might be risking all-in.\n\nGiven tournament, medium stack, I'd call to see flop and keep options.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nReturn JSON.",

We called 83 to see flop, leaving us with 150-107 = 43? Wait compute: Starting stack 150. Preflop: we raised 24 (so put 24). Opponent raised to 107, we called 83 more, total invested 24+83=107. So remaining stack = 150-107 = 43 chips. Pot after call: initial pot: blinds 4+8=12, plus our raise 24 (adds 24), opponent raise to 107 (adds 83 more from opponent?), Actually sequence: SB 4, BB 8, we raise to 24 (we put 24 total, so additional 16 beyond BB?), but okay. Then seat3 raise to 107 (adds 83 from them). Then we call 83. So pot now: 4+8+24+107+83 = 226? But given pot is 222. Slight discrepancy but fine. Our remaining stack is 150 - (24+83) = 43. So we are short-stacked relative to pot. On flop board 7h Qd 8c. We have Tc Jc: that gives us an open-ended straight draw (9 and 10? Actually we have T and J, board 7,8, Q. So we have 9? Wait we have T and J, board has 7,8,Q. Straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K? Actually we need 9 and 10 to make straight 7-8-9-10-J or 8-9-10-J-Q. We have T,J, so we need 9 and K? Let's examine: With T,J we can make straight with 9-10-J-Q-K? No we need 9 and K? Actually the board is 7,8,Q. To have straight we need 9-10-J? Let's list combos: 7-8-9-10-J (we have T,J, need 9). That's one straight: 7-8-9-10-J uses our J and T, board 7,8, need 9. The other: 8-9-10-J-Q uses our T,J, board 8,Q, need 9. So we need a 9 to complete straight (any suit). Also we have a gutshot? Actually we need 9 only. So we have a single-card draw (open-ended? Actually both ends are 9? Both combos require 9, so it's a gutshot? Wait open-ended means two cards complete, but only 9 works, so it's a single card draw (one-rank). So we have a one-out? Actually there are four 9s, but some may be dead (we don't know). So about 4 outs.\n\nWe also have a flush draw? We have clubs: Tc and Jc, board has 8c, so we have a flush draw (clubs). Actually board: 7h Qd 8c. So we have two clubs in hand, one club on board, need two more clubs to make flush. That's a 9-out flush draw (since 13 clubs total, we have 2, board 1, leaving 10 clubs left, but two needed, probability of hitting on turn or river). So we have both straight draw (one rank) and flush draw.\n\nWe have 43 chips left, pot 222, effective stack 43 (we are short). Opponent seat3 checked. Amount to call is 0, min raise 83 (which is larger than our stack). So we cannot raise (cannot meet min raise). Options: check (or bet all-in? Actually raise is not possible because raise_to must be at least min raise 83, we cannot, so we can only check). Could we go all-in as a raise? The rule: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So we could go all-in with 43, which is less than min raise, but it's allowed as an all-in raise. So legal actions: fold, check, raise (but raise would be all-in). But we have to consider opponent's tendencies: He checked on flop after 3-betting preflop and we called. He may be weak or trap. With our draw, we could bet (go all-in) to put pressure. Our stack is 43, pot 222, so an all-in bet would be about 19% of pot, not huge. Might be good to shove to try to win pot now or later.\n\nBut opponent's stack: He had 4 chips? Wait seat3 had 4"

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: We're BB (seat5) with Tc Jc. Stack 150 chips, after preflop we raised to 24, then opponent (Seat3) raised to 107 (so 3-bet). We called 83 to see flop, leaving us with 150-107 = 43? Wait compute: Starting stack 150. Preflop: we raised 24 (so put 24). Opponent raised to 107, we called 83 more, total invested 24+83=107. So remaining stack = 150-107 = 43 chips. Pot after call: initial pot: blinds 4+8=12, plus our raise 24 (adds 24), opponent raise to 107 (adds 83 more from opponent?), Actually sequence: SB 4, BB 8, we raise to 24 (we put 24 total, so additional 16 beyond BB?), but okay. Then seat3 raise to 107 (adds 83 from them). Then we call 83. So pot now: 4+8+24+107+83 = 226? But given pot is 222. Slight discrepancy but fine. Our remaining stack is 150 - (24+83) = 43. So we are short-stacked relative to pot. On flop board 7h Qd 8c. We have Tc Jc: that gives us an open-ended straight draw (9 and 10? Actually we have T and J, board 7,8, Q. So we have 9? Wait we have T and J, board has 7,8,Q. Straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K? Actually we need 9 and 10 to make straight 7-8-9-10-J or 8-9-10-J-Q. We have T,J, so we need 9 and K? Let's examine: With T,J we can make straight with 9-10-J-Q-K? No we need 9 and K? Actually the board is 7,8,Q. To have straight we need 9-10-J? Let's list combos: 7-8-9-10-J (we have T,J, need 9). That's one straight: 7-8-9-10-J uses our J and T, board 7,8, need 9. The other: 8-9-10-J-Q uses our T,J, board 8,Q, need 9. So we need a 9 to complete straight (any suit). Also we have a gutshot? Actually we need 9 only. So we have a single-card draw (open-ended? Actually both ends are 9? Both combos require 9, so it's a gutshot? Wait open-ended means two cards complete, but only 9 works, so it's a single card draw (one-rank). So we have a one-out? Actually there are four 9s, but some may be dead (we don't know). So about 4 outs.\n\nWe also have a flush draw? We have clubs: Tc and Jc, board has 8c, so we have a flush draw (clubs). Actually board: 7h Qd 8c. So we have two clubs in hand, one club on board, need two more clubs to make flush. That's a 9-out flush draw (since 13 clubs total, we have 2, board 1, leaving 10 clubs left, but two needed, probability of hitting on turn or river). So we have both straight draw (one rank) and flush draw.\n\nWe have 43 chips left, pot 222, effective stack 43 (we are short). Opponent seat3 checked. Amount to call is 0, min raise 83 (which is larger than our stack). So we cannot raise (cannot meet min raise). Options: check (or bet all-in? Actually raise is not possible because raise_to must be at least min raise 83, we cannot, so we can only check). Could we go all-in as a raise? The rule: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So we could go all-in with 43, which is less than min raise, but it's allowed as an all-in raise. So legal actions: fold, check, raise (but raise would be all-in). But we have to consider opponent's tendencies: He checked on flop after 3-betting preflop and we called. He may be weak or trap. With our draw, we could bet (go all-in) to put pressure. Our stack is 43, pot 222, so an all-in bet would be about 19% of pot, not huge.

Actually we have 9 needed for straight? Let's list possible straights: 4-5-6-7-8 (we have 8,7,4, need 5,6). Not possible. 5-6-7-8-9 (we have 7,8, need 5,6,9). Not there. 6-7-8-9-10 (we have 7,8,10, need 6,9). We have J, which is not needed. 7-8-9-10-J (we have 7,8,10,J, need 9). So we have open-ended straight draw: need 9 to make 7-8-9-10-J. Also we have gutshot to Q? Q-J-10-9-8? Actually board has Q, we have J,T, need 9 to make Q-J-10-9-8 straight? That's also a straight but need 9. So both draws need a 9. So we have a single-card draw (9) to make straight. Also we have a flush draw? Suits: board clubs: 8c, 4s, 7h, Qd. Only one club on board, we have Tc,Jc, two clubs. So we have a flush draw: need any club (except maybe already have two clubs). Actually we have two clubs, board has one club, so we have a nut flush draw? The highest club is Ace, we have Ten and Jack clubs. The board clubs: 8c only. So we have a flush draw with Jc, Tc, need any club >8 to make flush (9c, Kc, Ac, etc). So we have both straight draw (9) and flush draw (any club). That's strong draw.\n\nOpponent (Seat 3) DeepSeek-V3.2 has 4 chips left (short stack). They are the only opponent left. Stack 4 chips. Pot 222. They are short stacked; they may go all-in anytime.\n\nWe are on turn, they checked. Amount to call 0. Minimum raise is 83 (to 83 total? Actually raise_to 83). Legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nWe have 150 chips, opponent 4 chips. So opponent cannot raise further unless all-in. They have 4 chips left, they could be all-in for 4. But they checked. So we can check or raise. If we raise, we could put pressure, maybe force them to fold or go all-in. Minimum raise to 83 means raise total to 83 chips from our stack? Actually we have already contributed some to pot: Let's compute contributions: Preflop: we raised to 24, then called 83? Wait: Preflop: Seat5 raise 24 (to 24). Seat3 raise 107 (to 107). Seat5 call 83 (so they added 83 to match 107). So we have put 107 total preflop. Flop: both checked, no bets. Turn: seat3 check, we act.\n\nPot 222 includes our 107, opponent's 107? Actually opponent contributed 107 preflop, then check flop, turn check. So pot 222 = 107+107? Yes.\n\nNow opponent stack 4 chips left, so they are short-stacked. They could go all-in for 4 on turn or later.\n\nOur raise to 83 would be total bet of 83? That seems like we would be raising by 83 chips (since amount to call 0). Minimum raise to 83 means we must put 83 chips into pot. That would be a raise of 83 from zero, making total bet 83. That is less than opponent's stack (4). Actually raise of 83 > opponent's stack, so they'd be forced to call all-in for 4? In poker, if you raise more than opponent's stack, they can call all-in for remaining stack. So they'd be forced to go all-in for 4, and we would be putting 83 chips risking 83 to potentially win 226 (pot + opponent's 4). That's a good bet given our draws.\n\nBut we need to consider tournament dynamics: we have 150 chips, about 18.8 BB. Opponent has 4 chips, 0.5 BB. If we eliminate them, we gain 4 chips (tiny). But we also risk 83 chips, dropping to 67 chips, still decent. Might be okay.\n\nGiven we have strong draws, we could raise to apply pressure and maybe"

So we have both straight draw (9) and flush draw (any club). That's strong draw.\n\nOpponent (Seat 3) DeepSeek-V3.2 has 4 chips left (short stack). They are the only opponent left. Stack 4 chips. Pot 222. They are short stacked; they may go all-in anytime.\n\nWe are on turn, they checked. Amount to call 0. Minimum raise is 83 (to 83 total? Actually raise_to 83). Legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nWe have 150 chips, opponent 4 chips. So opponent cannot raise further unless all-in. They have 4 chips left, they could be all-in for 4. But they checked. So we can check or raise. If we raise, we could put pressure, maybe force them to fold or go all-in. Minimum raise to 83 means raise total to 83 chips from our stack? Actually we have already contributed some to pot: Let's compute contributions: Preflop: we raised to 24, then called 83? Wait: Preflop: Seat5 raise 24 (to 24). Seat3 raise 107 (to 107). Seat5 call 83 (so they added 83 to match 107). So we have put 107 total preflop. Flop: both checked, no bets. Turn: seat3 check, we act.\n\nPot 222 includes our 107, opponent's 107? Actually opponent contributed 107 preflop, then check flop, turn check. So pot 222 = 107+107? Yes.\n\nNow opponent stack 4 chips left, so they are short-stacked. They could go all-in for 4 on turn or later.\n\nOur raise to 83 would be total bet of 83? That seems like we would be raising by 83 chips (since amount to call 0). Minimum raise to 83 means we must put 83 chips into pot. That would be a raise of 83 from zero, making total bet 83. That is less than opponent's stack (4). Actually raise of 83 > opponent's stack, so they'd be forced to call all-in for 4? In poker, if you raise more than opponent's stack, they can call all-in for remaining stack. So they'd be forced to go all-in for 4, and we would be putting 83 chips risking 83 to potentially win 226 (pot + opponent's 4). That's a good bet given our draws.\n\nBut we need to consider tournament dynamics: we have 150 chips, about 18.8 BB. Opponent has 4 chips, 0.5 BB. If we eliminate them, we gain 4 chips (tiny). But we also risk 83 chips, dropping to 67 chips, still decent. Might be okay.\n\nGiven we have strong draws, we could raise to apply pressure and maybe",

In SB vs. a raise from MP (seat 4 maybe MP/CO). Position: SB is out of position post-flop. Opponent's raise size small, perhaps they are wide. Our stack moderate. Considering tournament stage? Not given chip stacks of others: Kimi-K2 45, MiniMax-M2 359, etc. Our stack 134, relative to others: we are shortish (mid). Might want to preserve chips. 6T is not strong enough to call a raise from a player who might have a decent range. Could consider folding. Could also consider 3-bet bluff? 6T is not a good bluff as it's not a premium. Raising to 24 (3BB) maybe could be seen as a 3-bet but risk. Opponent may call or re-raise. Better to fold.\n\nThus action fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have As Qh on button, stack 134, blinds 4/8. Effective stacks: 134 vs 8 BB? Actually 16.8 BB. Opponents: Seat1 SB 4 chips (short), Seat2 BB 303 chips (big). SB is very short (4 chips) cannot act? SB posted 4, but SB has only 4 chips total? Actually they posted SB, so they are all-in? They have 4 chips, which is the SB, so they are effectively all-in for 4. But they are already all-in, they cannot act further. So preflop: SB is all-in 4, BB is 8. So we have to consider that. The pot currently 12 (SB 4 + BB 8). We are on button, we can call 8 to see flop, or raise. Since SB is all-in, if we raise, we isolate BB and SB? Actually SB already all-in, can't call our raise. So raising would be a 3-way pot with BB and us. The SB is already all-in for 4, so if we call 8, pot will be 20 (4+8+8). If we raise to min 16, we put 16 total, meaning we add 8 more than call, raising total to 16, so we add 8 extra. That would be 4 (SB) + 8 (BB) + 16 (us) = 28 pot. The BB would have to call 8 more to match 16. So raising isolates BB, possibly get heads-up with BB if they call. Consider our hand: As Qh suited? Actually As Qh is Ace of spades and Queen of hearts, off-suit (different suits). Hand strength: AQs is strong, top 5% maybe. In tournament with 16.8 BB, we want to accumulate chips but also preserve stack. SB is very short; they are all-in for 4, we could call and maybe win 4 chips, but not significant. Raising could get value from BB if they call. BB stack is large 303, they likely call with wide range? But they are in BB, they might defend with many hands. Since we are on button, we can raise to isolate BB and get value. Also we could just call to see flop, but raising is standard.\n\nConsider pot odds: If we call 8 to win 4 from SB plus BB's 8 (they already posted) gives us 20 pot after call? Actually after call, we have contributed 8, total pot = 4+8+8=20. Our call costs 8 to win 12 (SB 4 + BB 8) net 12? Actually we are already in pot with SB 4 and BB 8, we call 8, we could win 12 (SB+BB) plus our 8? Wait we invest 8, pot 20 includes our 8, so net profit if we win is 12 (pot minus our contribution). So pot odds = 12/8 = 1.5:1, we need >40% equity to be correct. AQs vs SB's unknown range (they are all-in for 4, likely some random). Could be okay. But raising gives us more potential.\n\nGiven we have strong hand, raising is good. Minimum raise to 16 is okay. Stack is 134, raising 16 leaves 118. Good.\n\nThus action: raise to 16.\n\nWe need to ensure legal actions include raise. Yes.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Also opponent could have Qx or spade draws. Check-raise could be good to build pot. But we are short stack (14.8 BB). Opponent has larger stack, could call a bet. If we bet 8 (min raise?), raise to 8? Actually minimum raise is 8, meaning raise to 8 total? Since amount to call is 0, raise to 8 means bet 8. That's a small bet ~22% of pot.

So call would leave us with 146 - 106 = 40 chips left (including blind? Wait we put 106 more, total in pot 8+106=114). So stack after call = 146 - 106 = 40 chips left.

Stack shallow; calling will leave us with 40 chips, still enough to continue but will be short stack. Could consider folding to preserve chips. But maybe we can call as a speculative play?

          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 2s7h, very weak. Stack 142, blinds 8. Amount to call 4 (small blind). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise by 8 more). With such a weak hand, folding is standard. Consider any reason to limp? In BB you can check? Actually amount to call is 4 (small blind) because small blind posted 4, big blind posted 8, so as BB you can either call 4 (i.e., complete to 8) or raise. Usually you would just check (i.e., just post the blind) but here amount to call is 4, meaning you can just call the small blind to complete your big blind? Actually in BB, you have already posted 8, the small blind posted 4, you can either raise or check (i.e., do nothing). But the system says amount to call: 4, meaning you need to call the small blind to match the bet? But you already have 8 in, the small blind is 4, so you are effectively 4 over the small blind. Usually you can just check (i.e., not put more chips). But the interface may treat \"call\" as completing the bet to 8? Actually amount to call is 4, meaning you need to put 4 more to bring total to 8? But you already have 8 posted as BB, but maybe they treat call as \"call the small blind's 4\"? That seems odd. But typical logic: In BB, after SB posts 4, BB posted 8, the action is on BB, they can either raise or check (i.e., do nothing). So amount to call should be 0. But they show amount to call 4. Might be that the small blind is considered a bet of 4, and BB must call 4 to match? But they'd have to add 4 to make total 12? Actually pot is 12 (4+8). So BB's current contribution is 8, SB 4. If BB wants to \"call\", they'd need to match the SB's bet of 4? That would make BB total 12? That seems off. However, many poker bots treat BB as having posted 8, so amount to call is 0. But here they show amount to call: 4, maybe they consider that BB can either call the small blind (i.e., put 4 more to bring to 12) or raise to 16 total. That would be a \"limp\" call? Usually you wouldn't add more. So maybe the system expects \"call\" to be the action of just checking (i.e., no extra chips). But they set amount to call 4, maybe because the small blind is considered a bet and BB must call to continue. In that case, calling would be adding 4, making total 12 chips contributed (BB now 12). That seems weird but okay.\n\nGiven the hand is 2-7 offsuit, worst hand. Should fold. Even if we could check for free, but the system may require a call of 4 to stay in. But folding is safe.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning: worst hand, short stack relative to blinds, not worth risking chips.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Actually seat3 is out but raise 212). That raise is 212 total? Usually raise amount includes call? The raise of 212 likely means they put 212 chips total (i.e., they raised to 212). Since BB posted 16, they need to call 212-16 = 196 to match. The pot after raise: 8+16+212 = 236 (makes sense). So we have to call 196 to stay, but our stack is 102 chips total, we cannot call 196. Actually our stack is 102 chips, but we already posted 16 blind, leaving 86 remaining. So we cannot call full amount; we can go all-in for remaining 86. However legal actions only list fold, call. The system maybe doesn't allow raise because min raise is 408 which we cannot meet. But we could go all-in as a call? In poker, you can call all-in for less than amount to call; it's considered a call (or a call for less). So we can \"call\" which will be all-in for remaining 86. The action \"call\" will be accepted and we will be all-in.\n\nWe need to decide: hand Kd4h is weak, not a good candidate to call an all-in, especially short stack. Our stack is short relative to raise; we are effectively forced all-in for 86. The opponent raised to 212 from 239 chips stack (they have 239). They likely have a strong hand. So we should fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Opponent in Seat2 is the only other player left (they posted BB? Wait they are seat2, they posted BB? Actually seat2 posted BB 16, meaning they are big blind? Wait we are BB seat5, but seat2 posted BB 16. Something off: The description says your position: BB (Seat5). But actions show seat5 post_sb 8 (small blind), seat2 post_bb 16 (big blind). So you are actually SB? It says you posted small blind 8. So you are SB seat5. But they say Position: BB (Seat5). Might be mislabel. Let's interpret: You posted SB 8, so you are SB. The big blind is seat2 with 16 chips. So you are SB with 94 chips, 5.9 BB effective (since small blind 8). After blinds, pot 24. Action to you: amount to call 8 (to complete BB? Actually to call big blind 16? Wait you already posted 8, you need to call 8 more to match BB). So you can call 8, raise min to 32 (total). You have K\u2660 Q\u2665, a decent hand but not premium. In early stage tournament, stack 5.9 BB is short stack. You are short stack; you need to pick spots to go all-in or fold. KQ offsuit in SB vs BB with 236 chips? Actually BB has 236 chips. You have 94 chips. If you call 8, you will have 86 left. You can also raise to 32 (total). Minimum raise to 32 means you put total 32 chips (including your 8 already posted). So you would add 24 more. That would be a raise of 16 over call? Actually call is 8, raise to 32 is +24. That would be 32 total in pot from you (including 8). That would be 16 raise over big blind? Not sure.\n\nGiven short stack, typical play is to shove all-in if you have decent equity. KQ offsuit is decent but not great vs unknown. You could consider stealing blind: you could raise to 32 (which is 2x BB). But with 5.9 BB, raising may be okay. However, many players might call with wide range. Might be better to go all-in (94) to maximize fold equity? But you only have 94 chips, which is less than 6 BB, all-in would be 94 total (including 8 posted). That is about 5.9 BB, which is a decent shove. KQ suited? It's offsuit. In short stack, KQo is okay but not best. However, typical push/fold chart: With 5-6 BB, KQo is a push from SB? Usually push from SB with 5-6 BB if you have at least QJ, KQ maybe? I think KQ is pushable.\n\nThus best action: raise all-in (call amount to 94). But legal actions only allow raise to min 32. But you can raise to any amount up to your stack. So you could raise to 94 (all-in). So action: raise, raise_to 94.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually blinds are 8/16, so BB is 16, but stack 8 chips? That's less than BB, maybe short stack. Preflop: seat5 posted small blind 8, seat2 posted big blind 16. Then seat5 raised to 94 (so added 86 more). Seat2 called 78 (so total 94). So pot now 188 chips (including blinds). On flop 3s 2d 4d. Board is low, rainbow (two diamonds). Our hand: K\u2660 Q\u2665, no pair, no straight draw (needs A5 for straight, or 5 for gutshot? Actually board 3-2-4, we have open-ended straight draw? 2-3-4, we need 5 or A to make straight. We have KQ, no. So just overcards. Stack after preflop: we have 8 chips left? Wait we started with maybe 200? Actually we posted 8 SB, then raised 94 (total 102). So our stack after raise is original stack minus 102. The description says Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB). That suggests we are effectively at 8 chips left after raising? That seems inconsistent: we raised to 94, but we only have 8 chips left? Perhaps the stack shown is remaining after the raise? Let's compute: blinds 8/16, we posted 8 SB, then raise to 94 (so we added 86 more). So total contributed 94. If our stack was 102 (8+94) originally, then after that we have 0 left. But they show stack 8 chips. Maybe they misinterpret: after posting SB we have 8 chips left? Actually they say \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\". That suggests we have only 8 chips total before any action, which is less than big blind. But then we raised to 94, impossible. So likely the stack is after posting SB? Wait preflop: seat5 post_sb 8 (so we posted 8 from stack). Then we raise to 94, meaning we put total 94 in pot, which includes the 8 already posted. So we need to have at least 94 chips. The stack line might be erroneous. But we must treat as we have 8 chips left after the raise? Actually after raise, we have remaining chips = original stack - 94. If original stack unknown, but after raise we have 8 chips left? That would mean original stack = 102. So after raise we have 8 chips left. That matches \"Your Stack: 8 chips\". So we are short stack with 8 chips remaining (0.5 BB). So we are effectively all-in for 8 chips? But we already committed 94. So we have 8 chips left to act further. On flop, amount to call is 0, meaning opponent hasn't bet. Minimum raise to 78, but legal actions are fold, check. So we cannot raise because we have only 8 chips left, less than min raise. So we can only check or fold. Checking is default.\n\nWe need to decide: check (no bet) or fold? Since no bet, folding would concede pot. Checking is fine. Our hand is weak, but we have no bet to call. So we check.\n\nThus action: check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

The board has three diamonds: 3s 2d 4d 6d Kh. Actually 3s is spade, 2d,4d,6d are diamonds, Kh is heart. So there is a possible flush draw with diamonds, but we hold no diamond. Opponent could have a diamond flush (any two diamonds) for a flush. Also there is straight possibilities: board 2-3-4-6, missing 5 for straight, but we have no 5. Opp could have 5-5? Actually a straight would be 2-3-4-5-6, need a 5. Could be 5x. Also could have a straight using K? Not.\n\nOur stack is 8 chips, we are short-stacked (0.5 BB). The pot is 188 chips. We have 8 chips left, we are the BB with 8 chips. We posted small blind 8, big blind 16? Actually blinds are 8/16, we are BB seat 5, so we posted 16? Wait preflop actions: Seat5 post_sb 8, Seat2 post_bb 16. So seat5 is SB? Actually seat5 is BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat5)\", but actions show seat5 posted SB 8, seat2 posted BB 16. That's contradictory. Maybe seat5 is SB because seat2 is BB. But they say we are BB seat5. Might be mislabel. Anyway we have posted 8 (SB) and we have 8 chips left total (so we are effectively all-in? Wait stack 8 chips includes what we posted? Usually stack after posting blinds is remaining chips. So we have 8 chips left after posting SB 8, meaning we are effectively all-in? Actually we posted 8, then we raised 94 preflop (so we added 94 more?). Wait actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 8; Seat2 post_bb 16; Seat3 fold; Seat4 fold; Seat5 raise 94; Seat2 call 78. So seat5 raised from 8 to 94, meaning they added 86 more? So they have enough chips to raise. But later they have stack 8 chips left? Something inconsistent.\n\nProbably the stack shown is current stack after posting blinds and before hand: 8 chips (0.5 BB). So they are short stack, cannot raise, only check/fold. The pot is 188, they have 8 chips left, they can go all-in for 8.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check. Minimum raise to 78 but they cannot raise (insufficient). So they can either check (i.e., go all-in? Actually checking means not betting, but they still have 8 chips left, but they can't raise). They could also fold, but they have already contributed all chips? Actually they have 8 chips left, but they have already contributed 94 preflop? Wait they raised 94 preflop, which likely used all chips? If they had 8 chips total, they couldn't raise to 94. So maybe the stack is after posting blinds but before raising, they had 8 chips total? That is impossible. Something off.\n\nProbably the stack is remaining after all previous bets?

The board has three diamonds: 3s 2d 4d 6d Kh. Actually 3s is spade, 2d,4d,6d are diamonds, Kh is heart. So there is a possible flush draw with diamonds, but we hold no diamond. Opponent could have a diamond flush (any two diamonds) for a flush. Also there is straight possibilities: board 2-3-4-6, missing 5 for straight, but we have no 5. Opp could have 5-5? Actually a straight would be 2-3-4-5-6, need a 5. Could be 5x. Also could have a straight using K? Not.\n\nOur stack is 8 chips, we are short-stacked (0.5 BB). The pot is 188 chips. We have 8 chips left, we are the BB with 8 chips. We posted small blind 8, big blind 16? Actually blinds are 8/16, we are BB seat 5, so we posted 16? Wait preflop actions: Seat5 post_sb 8, Seat2 post_bb 16. So seat5 is SB? Actually seat5 is BB? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat5)\", but actions show seat5 posted SB 8, seat2 posted BB 16. That's contradictory. Maybe seat5 is SB because seat2 is BB. But they say we are BB seat5. Might be mislabel. Anyway we have posted 8 (SB) and we have 8 chips left total (so we are effectively all-in? Wait stack 8 chips includes what we posted? Usually stack after posting blinds is remaining chips. So we have 8 chips left after posting SB 8, meaning we are effectively all-in? Actually we posted 8, then we raised 94 preflop (so we added 94 more?). Wait actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 8; Seat2 post_bb 16; Seat3 fold; Seat4 fold; Seat5 raise 94; Seat2 call 78. So seat5 raised from 8 to 94, meaning they added 86 more? So they have enough chips to raise. But later they have stack 8 chips left? Something inconsistent.\n\nProbably the stack shown is current stack after posting blinds and before hand: 8 chips (0.5 BB). So they are short stack, cannot raise, only check/fold. The pot is 188, they have 8 chips left, they can go all-in for 8.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check. Minimum raise to 78 but they cannot raise (insufficient). So they can either check (i.e., go all-in? Actually checking means not betting, but they still have 8 chips left, but they can't raise). They could also fold, but they have already contributed all chips? Actually they have 8 chips left, but they have already contributed 94 preflop? Wait they raised 94 preflop, which likely used all chips? If they had 8 chips total, they couldn't raise to 94. So maybe the stack is after posting blinds but before raising, they had 8 chips total? That is impossible. Something off.\n\nProbably the stack is remaining after all previous bets? Actually after preflop raise 94, they would have 8-94? negative. So maybe the stack is the amount they have left after all previous actions, which is 8 chips (they are short). So they cannot bet any more. So they can only check (i.e., not bet). So they must check.\n\nBut we need to decide if we should check (i.e., not bet) or fold. Since amount to call is 0, we can check.

So it's a raise of 64 total (i.e., 48 raise over BB). We need to decide to fold, call, or raise.\n\nOur hand: 8T offsuit (8d Td). It's a decent suited? Actually unsuited (both diamonds? Wait 8d and Td both diamonds, so it's suited! Both are diamonds. So it's a suited Ten-Eight. That's a suited connector-ish, decent for deep stacks but at 12 BB, it's marginal. Position: button, we have advantage. Stack: 196 chips, 12.2 BB. Effective stack: min opponent stack? Seat2 has 137 chips (~8.5 BB), seat3 has 220 (~13.8 BB), seat4 has 322 (~20 BB). So effective stack is about 137 (seat2) but seat2 hasn't acted yet (post sb). Actually seat2 posted sb 8, still in hand. So effective stack is 137 chips. Our call would be 64 chips, leaving us with 132 chips (~8.25 BB). That's okay.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2's raise sizes: varied from small (4) to large (228). Recent raise of 64 (hand 62). That was a raise of 64 preflop (maybe from a 16 BB). So they sometimes raise big, sometimes small. Not clear. Could be a strong hand.\n\nOur hand 8dTd suited has decent equity vs random but not vs strong. At 12 BB, we might consider a 3-bet if we think we can isolate and have postflop skill, but 8T suited is not a typical 3-bet hand in short stack. Also raising to 112 (minimum raise) would be 112 total (i.e., raise to 112). That would be 48 more chips, total 112. That would be 5.5 BB. Might be too much.\n\nGiven we are short stack and our hand is marginal, calling is typical. Also we have button, we could call and try to see flop. But we must consider the SB (seat2) hasn't acted yet; after we call, seat2 will act (post sb). The SB has 137 chips, might call or raise. If they raise, we could be in tough spot.\n\nGiven the raise is 64 (4BB) and we have 12 BB, we can call and see flop. Our hand can make strong draws (flush, straight). So call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

Actually we have 8d Td, so we have two diamonds, plus board has two diamonds, making four diamonds total. Need one more diamond for flush. Also we have open-ended straight draw? Cards: 8,9,10,7? Actually we have 8 and 10, board 7,9,3. So we have 7-8-9-10, need a 6 or J for straight. So we have gutshot? Actually we have 8-10, board 7-9, we have 8-9-10, missing 6 for 6-7-8-9-10 straight, also missing J for 7-8-9-10-J. So we have two outs for straight (6 and J). Plus we have flush draw: any diamond except 3,9,8,10? We have 8d Td, board has 3d 9d, so remaining diamonds are A,K,Q,J, etc. Total diamonds left: 13 total diamonds, we have 2, board has 2, so 9 remaining. But two of those are straight outs (Jd counts both straight and flush). So total outs about 9 (flush) + 2 (straight) - overlap (Jd) = 10 outs? Actually Jd is counted in flush outs; also Jd is a straight out. So unique outs: diamonds other than 3d,9d,8d,Td = 9. Among those, Jd is also straight, but still an out. So total outs = 9 (flush) + 1 (6) = 10? Wait 6 is not a diamond, so add 1. So total outs = 10. So about 10 outs.\n\nPot: 352. Bet 200, we need to call 200. So pot odds: call 200 to win 552 (pot 352 + 200 call = 552). So pot odds = 200/552 = 36.2% required. Our chance to hit on turn and river with 10 outs: approximate probability: 10 outs * 2 = 20% on turn, plus if miss turn, chance on river = (42 outs? Actually 10 outs out of 46 after turn) ~21.7% * (1-20%) = about 17%? Let's compute: probability to hit by river = 1 - ((46-10)/46)*((45-10)/45) = 1 - (36/46)*(35/45) = 1 - (0.7826)*(0.7778)=1 - 0.608 = 0.392. So about 39% chance to hit by river. That's above 36% required, so call is +EV.\n\nBut also consider opponent: MiniMax-M2 raised preflop to 64, we called, now bets 200 on flop. He likely has a hand like overpairs (TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA) maybe a set (33,99,77) or a flush draw, or a straight draw, or a made hand like 9d8d? Actually board 3d 9d 7h. He may have 9x, 8x, a flush draw, etc. He bet 200 into pot 352, about 57% pot. He could be semi-bluffing with draws, or value betting with strong hand. Our draw is decent.\n\nStack: we have 132 chips, we are short stack (8.2 BB). Our remaining stack after calling 200? Wait we have 132 chips total, but we already put 64 preflop, so current effective stack is 132-64 = 68 chips left. But the pot shows 352, includes our 64? Let's compute: preflop: MiniMax raised 64, we called 64. So pot after preflop = 64 (raise) + 64 (call) + small blind 8 + big blind 16 = 152? Actually small blind posted 8, big blind 16, then raise to 64 from seat 4 (so he put 64, not 64 extra?), but raise amount includes the big blind? In typical, raise to 64 means he put 64 total, so additional 48 on top of 16. Then we call 64 (matching). So pot = SB 8 + BB 16 + MiniMax 64 + us 64 = 152. But the flop pot is 352, meaning maybe there were antes? But not needed. Anyway, we have 132 chips total,"

Actually seat3 is after seat2? Let's see order: Seat5 is BB, seat2 is SB? Wait blinds: SB is seat5 posted 8? Actually actions: Seat5 post_sb 8, Seat2 post_bb 16, Seat3 raise 68. So seat5 is SB? Confusing. The description says Position: BB (Seat5). But action shows seat5 posted sb 8, seat2 posted bb 16. So seat5 is small blind, seat2 is big blind. But they say our position BB seat5, maybe they mis-ordered. Regardless we are the small blind (or BB) with 7c6s, facing a raise of 68 from seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2). Our stack 368, pot 92 (includes blinds). Amount to call 60 (68-8? Actually we posted 8, need to call 60). Minimum raise to 120 (i.e., raise total 120). Need to decide.\n\nWe should consider opponent's raise size: 68 is 4.25 BB (big blind is 16). That's a relatively standard raise (around 4-5 BB). Opponent's range likely strong, but could include suited connectors, etc. Our hand 7-6 suited is speculative. In early position (they are seat3, maybe UTG?), we are in SB (or BB). With 23 BB stack, we could call and see flop for cheap, but we are out of position postflop. 7-6 suited can flop well, but also can be dominated.\n\nWe need to consider tournament: stack 23 BB, medium depth, we can afford a call if we think we have implied odds. But being out of position, call could be risky.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: from recall, they have raised amounts varying from 12 to 212, showing they can raise big or small. Not much info on folding. They have shown some suited connectors? Showdowns show they had 7cAc (top pair), 6s6c (pair), KsKh (premium), KcKs (premium), 9h9c (pair). So they seem to play strong hands. Not clear about speculative.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, I'd lean to fold. The raise is 68, we would need to call 60 to see flop, but out of position, likely to be dominated. Better to preserve stack.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #72 preflop. Position BTN, 7d9c, stack 368 (23 BB). Blinds 8/16. Small blind seat2 8 chips, big blind seat3 16 chips. Seat4 folded. So we face a raise? Actually actions: seat2 posted sb 8, seat3 posted bb 16, seat4 folded, now it's our turn. Amount to call 16 (big blind). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise by at least 16). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength: 7d9c is a suited connector? Actually 7d9c unsuited. Off-suit gap 2. Not strong. In BTN, can open raise or call? But there is already a big blind (seat3) who posted 16. We could call 16, which is 1 BB. That's a decent call if we think we have equity vs BB's range. However we also have a short stack (23 BB). Raising to 32 would be 2 BB total. That's a standard open raise size for BTN (2-2.5 BB). But the BB is already there; raising would be 32 total (i.e., raise to 32, which is 16 more). That is a standard raise. Should we raise? 7-9 offsuit is a marginal hand; many players raise with it in BTN? Usually you'd raise with a broader range from BTN, maybe 7-9 off-suit is borderline; some players open with any two cards in BTN. But given we have short stack, we might want to preserve chips; but also we want to accumulate.\n\nWe should also consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (seat2) is the SB, not the BB. The BB is DeepSeek-V3.2 seat3. We have data for Kimi-K2's raises preflop (various sizes). Not sure about DeepSeek's tendencies. We have no info about BB.\n\nBut we are facing only the BB's blind; they haven't acted yet. So we can raise to try to steal blinds. With 7d9c offsuit, not great but can still raise to attempt steal; risk if BB calls and has stronger range. However our stack is 23 BB, not desperate.\n\nGiven the hand is weak, maybe we should just call and see flop cheap, hoping to hit a straight draw. But calling 1 BB with a weak hand is okay but may get us into tricky postflop decisions.\n\nBetter perhaps to fold? But folding a BTN hand for 1 BB is too tight; we can at least call.\n\nI think optimal is to call 16 (i.e., limp) to see flop cheap. However many players think limping is suboptimal; raising is better to apply pressure. But with 7-9 offsuit, raising may be exploited.\n\nGiven limited info, I'd call.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

That seems impossible. Actually seat2's stack is 8 chips, they posted SB 8, so they are all-in already (post sb). Then they cannot raise. Something inconsistent. Maybe seat2's stack is 8 chips left after posting sb? Actually they posted sb 8, so they have 0 left; they cannot raise. But actions show they raised to 61, maybe they have more chips? Could be a mistake. Let's assume seat2 has more chips, maybe 120? The table shows seat2: 8 chips (folded) earlier? Actually seat2: \"Kimi-K2 - 8 chips\" maybe that's current stack after posting?

We have open-ended straight draw? Board K J 4, we have 5,4. Actually we have pair of fours, and we have a gutshot straight draw? Let's see possible straight: 6-5-4-? Not. The board: K J 4. To make a straight we need 8-9-10? No. So only potential is a flush draw and a pair of fours. Also we have backdoor straight possibilities. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) checked to us. Pot is 32. We are in BB, stack 336. Opponent is 326 chips. Both have deep stacks. We have a marginal hand, but we have a flush draw and a pair. Could consider betting to protect and build pot. But opponent just checked; we could check behind and see turn. If we bet, we risk being called or raised by better hand (Kc, Jc, etc). What is opponent likely? He called preflop with 8 from SB, so his range includes many hands: suited connectors, broadways, etc. On flop with Kc Jc 4c, his check could be weak. Betting could be good to take pot or get value from draws. Our hand is not strong enough for big bet maybe small bet 16 (half pot). Legal raise minimum 16. Could raise to 48? Actually raise to total amount. Minimum raise to 16 means you can raise to at least 32? Wait: amount to call is 0, so raise to at least 16? Usually raise must be at least double the big blind? But given min raise to 16, means raise total bet of 16? So we can bet 16. That would be half pot. That seems fine.\n\nConsider pot odds: If we bet 16, we might get called by worse draws or by hands like Kx, Jx, etc. But we risk being raised by stronger like Kc, Jc, etc. But opponent may not raise.\n\nGiven tournament stage (21 BB), we want to accumulate chips but also not risk too much. A bet of 16 is modest.\n\nThus action: raise to 48? Actually raise to total amount. Let's decide to bet 48 (3BB) maybe? But min raise 16, we can raise to 48. Might be okay.\n\nWe need to decide: raise to 48 (total bet). Reason: we have flush draw and pair, want to protect and build pot.\n\nThus JSON.",

Actually if they have Ace, they'd have two pair (Aces and Tens) because board already has Ace and Ten. So they'd have A? with any other card, they'd have two pair Aces and Tens (since board has Ace and Ten). That's better than our single pair Tens.\n\nAlso they could have a straight draw like 9J (open-ended) for a straight: 9J would give 9-J-T-A-? Actually 9-J gives a straight 9-10-J-Q-K?

Opponent (MiniMax-M2) in seat 4 has unknown hand. They called flop bet. Pot after flop: 144 (preflop: blinds 8+16, flop bet 48 from us, call from MiniMax 48). So pot 144 includes our 48, his 48, blinds 8+16? Actually pot includes all chips: before flop pot had 8+16+16+8? Let's compute: Preflop: SB 8 (us), BB 16 (opponent), seat 4 call 16, seat5 call 8. So pot after preflop: 8+16+16+8 = 48. Then flop bet 48 from us, call 48 from seat4. So pot becomes 48 + 48 + 48 = 144. Good.\n\nNow turn card not shown. Actually board after turn: 7h Ts Ad 5c ?. Wait board: \"7h Ts Ad 5c\". That's 4 cards; turn is 5c? Actually board shows 4 cards: 7h (flop 1), Ts (flop 2), Ad (flop 3), 5c (turn). So turn is 5c (clubs). So board: 7h Ts Ad 5c.\n\nNow it's our turn? Actually actions: preflop, flop, now turn: we have amount to call 0, min raise 48, legal actions fold, check, raise. So it's our decision on turn, after opponent hasn't acted yet? Wait order: we are BB seat5, opponent seat4 is MP? Actually seat order: seat1,2,3,4,5. Preflop: seat5 post_sb (we are SB? Actually we are BB seat5, but they posted small blind 8? Wait blinds 8/16, seat5 is BB, so they posted 16 as BB. But actions show seat5 post_sb 8 - meaning they posted small blind? Something off. But we accept given.\n\nNow flop: seat5 bet 48, seat2 folded, seat4 called 48. So after flop, seat5 acted first (probably because SB? anyway). Now turn: it's seat5's action again (since seat4 hasn't acted yet). So we have option to bet (raise) or check.\n\nOur hand: Pair of tens, board has Ace high, potential straight draws? Board: 7, T, A, 5. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J? Not. Could be 6-7-8-9? Not. So no immediate draws. Opponent could have Ace (top pair Aces), could have Ten (two pair), could have 7-5 combos, etc.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: we have 304 chips, opponent 262. Pot 144. If we bet 48 (minimum raise), pot would be 192, opponent would need call 48 to continue, leaving them about 214 after call. Our stack after bet would be 256.\n\nWe need to think about opponent tendencies: recall opponent's turn bets: they bet small amounts (8, 28, 29, 32) in previous hands. Those are relatively small relative to pot? Not sure pot sizes. Likely they are modest. Could indicate they are passive or try to protect.\n\nWe also might consider that we have top pair but weak kicker; if opponent has Ace, they have top pair (Aces) with any kicker, they beat us. If opponent has Ten, they have two pair (Tens and something else) which also beats us (we have only pair). Actually we have pair of tens; opponent could have Ten with something else, giving them two pair (Tens + something). That also beats us. So our hand is vulnerable.\n\nThus maybe we should check and see if they bet later. Check to control pot size.\n\nPot odds: If we bet and they call, we risk 48 to possibly win 192. But if they have Ace or better, we lose. If they have weaker hand (e.g., 9-8, etc), we may be ahead. But we have no strong kicker; many hands beat us.\n\nThus likely checking is prudent.\n\nBut also consider tournament stage: stack 19 BB, need to accumulate chips.

It's our turn? Let's see: After turn, actions: Seat5 call 48, so pot now includes turn bet. Now river: It's our turn (Seat5) after opponent (MiniMax-M2) acted on turn. Actually after turn call, the next street is river, and it's our action first because we are in BB? Usually order: after turn betting round ends, the button is next, but since only two players remain (Seat4 and Seat5), the player who acted first on the previous street acts first on next street. On turn, order: Seat5 checked, Seat4 bet, Seat5 called. So after call, the betting is closed, and on river, the first to act is the player who was last to act on previous street? Actually in heads-up, the dealer acts first preflop, but after flop, the player who is left of the button acts first. In BB vs CO situation: Seat5 is BB, Seat4 is CO (cutoff). On flop, after preflop, seat5 (BB) acted first (bet 48), seat4 called. Turn: seat5 checked, seat4 bet, seat5 called. So on river, seat5 (BB) is first to act (since he was last to act on previous street? Actually after turn betting, the player who made the bet (seat4) is considered the aggressor, and the other player gets action first on river. So seat5 acts first. So we need to decide action on river with board 7h Ts Ad 5c 9c, our hand 3s Tc. So we have pair of tens (top pair) with kicker? Actually board: T, A, 9, 5, 7. We have Tc, so we have two tens (pair), plus straight draws? Let's evaluate opponent's range. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has 214 chips, stack 214, we have 256. Pot is 240 now? After turn call, pot = previous pot 240? Let's compute: Preflop: blinds 8+16 =24. Calls: seat4 16, seat5 8 => total 48? Actually preflop pot: 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 16 (call) + 8 (call) = 48. Then flop bet 48 by seat5, seat4 called 48 => pot adds 96, total pot = 144. Turn: seat5 check, seat4 bet 48, seat5 call 48 => adds 96, pot = 240. Yes pot 240 now. No river bet yet. So we are first to act, can check or bet/raise. Opponent stack 214, we have 256.\n\nOur hand: Pair of tens, top pair (tens) with Ace kicker on board. Opponent could have Ace, could have straight draws (8-6, 6-4?), board: A T 9 5 7. Straight possibilities: 8-6 gives 6-7-8-9-10 straight? Actually board has 7,9,5, T, A. 6-8 would make 6-7-8-9-10 straight (needs 8 and 6). Opponent could have 8-6 combos. Also 8-9? Already 9 on board. 6-8 combos are possible. Also 8-8? Pair of 8s not straight. Also 6-5? 5 on board. 6-5 gives 5-6-7-8-9? Need 8. Not.\n\nAlso possible flush? Board has two clubs: Ts, 5c, 9c (two clubs). Our hand has 3s, Tc (no clubs). So opponent could have club flush draw with two clubs in hand (e.g., Kc Qc). But there are only two clubs on board, need 3 clubs total for flush, so need both clubs in hand. That's possible.\n\nAlso opponent could have Ace high (A?).\n\nWe need to decide action: Check or bet. Consider opponent's tendencies: recall opponent's turn betting patterns: they bet small amounts on turn (8-32) in previous hands. In this hand they bet 48 (size of pot/5?). Actually pot 144, they bet 48 = 1/3 pot. That's moderate. Could be value bet or bluff.\n\nOur stack is 256, pot 240, we can bet for value. We have top pair, but opponent could have Ace (A with something) giving two pair (Aces and Tens). That would beat us. Also opponent could have straight (6"

So he likely had a decent hand, maybe broadways, suited connectors, etc.\n\nFlop: Board 7h Ts Ad. We bet 48 (3BB). He called. So his range includes Aces, Tens, maybe draws, maybe middle pairs, etc.\n\nTurn: board 5c. He bet 48 (about half pot). We checked. He bet again 48. Could be a continuation bet with Aces, Tens, maybe a flush draw? The turn introduced a club, giving a possible flush draw (two clubs on board: 5c, plus later 9c). He could have clubs.\n\nRiver: board 9c (third club). He bets 48 again. This is a river bet of about half pot. Could be value with Ace (A9, A5, A7, etc), Ten (T9, T5, T7), maybe a made flush (clubs). He could also be bluffing missed draws (like Jc8c, etc). Our hand: Ten pair. Could be best? Let's consider possible opponent holdings.\n\nBoard final: Ts Ad 5c 9c 7h.

The flop had no clubs, turn added 5c, river 9c, so only two clubs on board. So flush not possible for opponent unless they have two clubs in hand. That would be a nut flush? Not possible because need five clubs, only three clubs total (2 on board + 2 in hand) = flush. Actually flush needs 5 of same suit. There are only two clubs on board, so opponent would need both hole cards clubs, making a flush. That's possible.\n\nOur hand includes Tc (clubs) and 3s. So we have one club.

In BB with short stack (~7 BB), typical strategy: if you have no raise before you, you can consider limping (call) with speculative hands if implied odds, but stack is shallow, so not many implied odds. Also there are only 2 opponents left: Seat 2 (218 chips) in SB? Actually seat 2 posted SB 16, seat 5 is BB posted 32. So only SB and BB left. So we are heads-up preflop. With 7 BB, you could consider raising to steal blinds? But SB already posted 16, BB is us. The SB is a short stack? 218 chips, about 6.8 BB (since BB is 32). So both are short. In heads-up, 5cTc is not a premium hand but could be playable. Since it's BB, we could just check (call 0) but we already posted BB, we can check (i.e., just see flop) if we want. But amount to call is 16 (the SB's blind). If we just check, we would be checking to SB? Actually in BB, after SB posts, action is to act first. The amount to call is SB's blind (16). So we can call (i.e., match 16) or raise. If we check, that means we are not calling SB's blind; but we have already posted BB, but we still need to match SB's blind to continue. In poker, you cannot check when there is a bet; you must call or raise. So we must either call 16, raise to 64, or fold (fold would be weird, you'd just give up BB). So likely we call.\n\nGiven hand strength: 5cTc suited, not great but can make flush, straight. With short stack, you may want to preserve chips. Call 16 to see flop, but if flop is bad you may be forced to fold. However you could also raise to try to steal, but 5cTc is weak for a raise; SB may call or re-raise. Since SB is also short, they could shove all-in. Raising to 64 (2 BB) may be too small; they'd likely call or raise. Better to just call and see flop.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nWe need JSON with raise_to null.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

To make a straight we need 9 and J? Wait 5-6-7-8-9 is a straight, but we have 5 and T, not 6. So we have 5, T. No immediate combos. We have a backdoor flush draw? Board has two diamonds, we have clubs. No. So we have nothing, just overcards (T) and a low pair? No pair. So we are behind likely. Opponent (Seat2) bet 32 into pot 96, so pot after bet is 128? Actually pot before bet: 96. Bet 32 adds to pot, making 128, and opponent's bet is 32. We need to call 32 to see turn.\n\nOur stack is 216, we have 6.8 BB, short stack. Opponent has 186 chips, slightly bigger. In BB, we are short. Should we fold? Evaluate: Our hand is weak, no equity, maybe 5c Tc has about 10%? Let's compute: board 7-8-A, we have T5. Opponent unknown range, could be many combos. Our equity is low. With short stack, we may consider a shove? Minimum raise to 64, but we could go all-in 216. But raising may be too much, we have no equity.\n\nGiven we have only 6.8 BB, and opponent bet 32 (1 BB). Actually blinds are 16/32, so bet is 1 BB. Our stack is 216, so we could call and still have 184 left.\n\nBut calling with a weak hand is not good. Fold seems correct.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: we could recall opponent seat2 actions.

The raise_to is total amount we put in. We can raise to all-in if we want. However, 7s5s is not a good hand to steal UTG, especially with short stack; but sometimes short stack shove is okay to try to steal blinds? However UTG with 7-5 suited is not a good candidate; it's not premium enough. The effective stack is short, but we could consider a shove to try to pick up blinds if opponents are tight. But there are only two players left to act (seats 2 and 3?

          "reasoning_content": "We have a hand: BB (seat5) with Qs Ac. Board: 6h 7c 8h. So we have gutshot straight draw? Actually we have Ace and Queen. Board 6-7-8: we have a gutshot to 5-9? With Ace we have backdoor flush? Two hearts on board, we have Ace of spades, queen of spades, no hearts. So we have a gutshot straight draw: need 5 or 9 to complete straight (6-7-8). Actually we have 6-7-8, we need 5 or 9 to make straight. We have Ace and Queen, no 5 or 9. So no immediate made hand. Also we have overcards Ace and Queen, but board is low. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) checked to us. We are in BB, after preflop raise to 8 and opponent called, and BB called 6 (so pot 25). Opponent checked. We have position? Actually we are BB, we are first to act after flop? The flop action: seat4 (MiniMax-M2) check, then it's our turn. So we are out of position (since we are BB but after flop we act after opponent). So we have to decide: check, bet (raise). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot call because amount to call is 0. So options: check, or bet (raise). We need to consider opponent tendencies. We have no data on MiniMax-M2 flop checks; recall shows none. Could search for general patterns? Might recall opponent preflop raise? In preflop, they called our raise. So they are likely a calling station or maybe a decent player. Stack sizes: both around 192 chips, we have 192-? Actually we raised 8 preflop, we have 192-8? But we still have 192 chips because we are seat5 with 192 stack? Actually after raise 8, we have 192-8? The stack listed is 192 chips (96 BB). Probably includes our remaining after posting blinds? But we posted 2 blind? Actually we are BB, posted 2, then raised to 8, so net we put 8 (including blind). So remaining stack about 184? But not needed.\n\nWe have a decent hand: Ace high with gutshot and backdoor flush draw. Could bet to protect and maybe take pot. Board is coordinated (6-7-8). Opponent may have straight draws (5-9), two pair, sets? But board is low, unlikely set (6-7-8). Could have 6-6, 7-7, 8-8 combos. Could have combos that beat us. Our raise size: minimum raise to 6 (i.e., raise to 6 total? Actually amount to call 0, minimum raise is 6 meaning we need to bet at least 6 chips). Pot is 25. A typical continuation bet maybe half pot (12-13). We can bet 12 to 15. We have decent equity: we have about 12% straight draw + backdoor flush maybe 4% + Ace high maybe 10% vs unknown range. Could be okay to bet.\n\nConsider tournament: we have medium stack, 96 BB, can afford to gamble. Opponent's tendencies unknown. Might be safe to bet to protect against draws and take pot if they missed.\n\nThus raise to maybe 12 chips (total bet). Since legal raise to 6 minimum, we can raise to 12. Provide reasoning.\n\nThus output JSON.",

Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) call 5 (since they already posted 1, they call additional 5 to match 6). Amount to call is 4 (we need to put 4 more to call 6). Minimum raise to 10 (so raise to total 10). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand QcKs (unsuited). In BB vs raise from UTG? Actually seat2 is maybe early position (seat2 after seat1). Not sure seat numbers correspond to positions but seat2 is likely UTG or maybe early. We have deep stack 107.5 BB, so can play.\n\nOur hand is decent: King-Queen offsuit, not premium but playable in BB vs a raise and two callers. The raise size is 6 (3 BB). That's small. Multiway pot, we have position after flop (we are in BB, after the flop we will be first to act? Actually after flop, action starts with UTG (seat2) then seat3 then seat4 then seat5 (us). So we are last preflop, after flop we will be after seat4? Actually seat4 is SB, seat5 is BB. So after flop, action starts with the player left of the button (SB) or UTG? In a 5-player table, button is seat5? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is maybe button? Not sure. But we are likely last to act preflop; after flop, action starts with seat2 (UTG) then seat3, seat4, then us. So we will be last on each street, which is good.\n\nGiven we have QcKs, we can consider 3-betting or calling. The raise is small (3 BB). With 2 callers already, pot is already 6*3 = 18 plus blinds and SB? Actually pot after actions: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6 (so seat2 puts 6 total, i.e., 6-2=4 extra?), call 6 from seat3 (they put 6 total), call 5 from seat4 (they put 5 total). So pot = SB 1 + BB 2 + seat2 6 + seat3 6 + seat4 5 = 20? Actually they said pot: 20 chips. Yes.\n\nSo if we call 4, pot becomes 24, we have 4 in, total pot 24. If we raise to 10 (i.e., total 10), we add 8 more chips, pot becomes 28 (since we add 8). That would be a 4-bet? Actually we are 3-betting (original raise 6, we raise to 10). That's a small 3-bet size (5 BB total). Might be okay.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: recall opponent seat2 (Kimi-K2) previous actions: hand1 fold preflop, hand2 call preflop 8 (so they raised? Actually they called 8? Not sure). They folded on flop. Not much data.\n\nSeat3 DeepSeek-V3.2 unknown.\n\nSeat4 MiniMax-M2 posted SB and called. Not much.\n\nOur hand QcKs is not a strong raising hand against a 3 BB raise, especially with two callers. Could call and see flop. 3-bet may be too aggressive but could isolate. However we are out of position preflop but will be in position postflop. 3-bet could be okay to take control.\n\nGiven we have a decent stack and want to preserve chips, maybe call and see flop. The raise is small; calling is fine.\n\nPot odds: we need to call 4 to win 20 (already) plus our call adds to pot 24, so pot odds ~4/24 = 1:6, good.\n\nThus call.\n\nReasoning: decent hand, multiway, raise small, want to see flop, preserve stack.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null.\n\n"

The raise is small; calling is fine.\n\nPot odds: we need to call 4 to win 20 (already) plus our call adds to pot 24, so pot odds ~4/24 = 1:6, good.\n\nThus call.\n\nReasoning: decent hand, multiway, raise small, want to see flop, preserve stack.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to output JSON with action. Decide: check or raise? Let's consider opponent likely to have strong hands: seat2 raised preflop, likely strong. Seat3 called, could be medium. Seat4 checked, maybe weak. We have top pair but vulnerable. Raising could protect and get value from weaker hands like KJ, Qx, J10, etc. But risk of re-raise from stronger opponent (like set). If we raise to, say, 12 (minimum raise is 4, so raise to 12? Actually raise amount total? Minimum raise to 4 means you need to put total 4 chips? Wait amount to call is 0, min raise to 4 means you need to raise at least to 4 chips total (i.e., bet 4). So we could raise to 8, 12, etc.\n\nGiven pot 24, a bet of 8 is 1/3 pot, could be okay. But we might want to protect against draws: board has potential straight draws? Actually there is a gutshot: 8-J? Let's compute: board T Q 6, possible straight draws: 8-9? Not. The only straight that uses both board cards is 8-9-10-J-Q (needs 8 and 9, J). That's two cards, not possible. Or 7-8-9-10-J (needs 7,8,9,J). Not possible. So there are no immediate straight draws. Flush draws: need two spades or two clubs? Board spade 6, clubs none. So only one spade on board, you have one spade, need two more spades for flush draw, not possible. So limited draws.\n\nThus checking could allow opponent to bet and we can call or raise later. But we have good hand; we could bet for value. Since opponent seat2 raised preflop, they may have strong hand like AK, AQ, etc. If they have AK, they have Ace high, we beat them. If they have AQ, they'd have top two pair? Actually they would have AQ, they'd have two pair (Q and A? No board Q T 6, they have A Q, they'd have pair of Qs with Ace kicker, same as us but we have K kicker, they have A kicker, they'd be ahead. So we would be behind. So raising could be risky if they have AQ.\n\nBut we don't know. Maybe check to see their action. However typical strategy: with top pair in BB after opponent checked, you could check behind if you think you are not best. But we have decent equity.\n\nGiven we are deep (105 BB), we can afford to bet. I think raising to 12 (half pot) is good to extract value from weaker hands and protect. If they have a set they may re-raise, but we can fold. So choose raise.\n\nThus JSON: action \"raise\", raise_to 12, reasoning.\n\n",

Board: T Q 6 4, we have Qc Ks, so pair of queens, K kicker, also we have open-ended straight draw? No, need J and 9 for straight, not present. So just pair.\n\nPot 60. Opponents: Seat2 (Kimi-K2) and Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) are still in. Seat2 raised preflop 6, called by Seat3, Seat4 (folded later), Seat5 (us) called 4. So preflop we called 4 (bb). On flop we bet 12, both called. So pot after flop: initial pot 60? Actually pot listed 60 at turn start includes flop betting? Let's compute: Preflop: blinds 1/2, SB 1, BB 2, then raise to 6, call 6, call 5, call 4 => contributions: SB 1, BB 2, Seat1 folded, Seat2 raised 6 (plus 2 blind? Actually raise 6 means total 6?), but anyway pot after preflop maybe 1+2+6+6+5+4 =24? Not sure. Flop: Seat4 check, we bet 12, Seat2 call 12, Seat3 call 12. So added 12*3 =36. So pot becomes 24+36=60. Yes pot 60 at turn. Good.\n\nNow turn card is unknown to us? Actually board shows Th Qd 6s 4c (four cards). So turn is 4c. So we are on turn after betting on flop. Now amount to call? Not given. We need to decide action. The legal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call is 0 (so no bet yet). Minimum raise to 12.\n\nWe need to decide whether to bet/raise or check. Opponents: Seat2 (Kimi-K2) and Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2). We have no info on their tendencies. We can recall previous actions: we just raised preflop? Actually we called preflop. On flop we bet 12 (half pot). Both called. So they seem willing to call with maybe medium strength.\n\nOur hand: top pair, decent kicker. Potential threats: opponent could have a set (TT, QQ, 66). TT possible? Board has T, so set of tens would be TT in hand, but we have K and Q, so opponent could have T? Actually they could have TT (two tens) but there is only one ten on board, so remaining three tens in deck, they could have TT. Similarly QQ set possible (one queen on board, they could have QQ). Also 66 set possible (one six on board). Also straight draws: 9-8? Not relevant. Also two pair combos: QJ, QT, etc.\n\nWe have top pair, but vulnerable to sets. Pot 60, we have 199 chips. We could bet to protect, maybe raise to ~30-40. Turn raise to 30 would be decent.\n\nBut we need to consider tournament stage: 199 chips, blinds 1/2, so effective stack ~100 BB, decent. We can be aggressive.\n\nWhat about opponent's stack sizes: Seat2 173, Seat3 163. Both similar. So we could attempt to extract value.\n\nCheck vs bet: If we check, we give free card (river) and risk opponent hitting set or improving. Better to bet.\n\nRaise amount: Minimum raise is 12, but we can raise more. We need to decide a raise amount. Typically pot-sized bet on turn (60) = 60. Could raise to 70? But we have to consider we are in SB, out of position. Might want to bet around 30-40 to protect.\n\nWe can also consider that we have a decent hand, we want to protect against draws like J9 for straight? Actually board: T Q 6 4, straight draws: 8-9? Not. The only straight draw is 8-9- J? No. So not many draws. So maybe a smaller bet is okay.\n\nBut opponent could have a made hand like QJ (two pair QJ) or QT (two pair Q T) which we beat? Actually QJ is two pair QJ, we have pair Q, kicker K, which beats QJ? Two pair beats one pair, so QJ > QK? Actually QJ is Q and J pair? Wait board: Qd, Th, 6s, 4c. Opponent with QJ would have two pair Q and J? No"

Actually board: Th (hearts), Qd (diamonds), 6s (spades), 4c (clubs), 6d (diamonds). No flush possible. We have pair of queens. Opponents: Seat2 (Kimi-K2) and Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2). Both called our bets on flop and turn. We bet 12 on flop, they called. Turn we bet 40, they called. So they are calling big bets, maybe they have strong hands or draws. Board now has paired 6s. Potential full house possibilities: 6-6, Q-6, etc. Opponent could have 66, 6x, Qx, TT, maybe straight draws? Board: T, Q, 6,4,6. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q? No J not present. 5-6-7-8-9? No. So no straight. Potential two pair: Q6, Q4, QT, 6T, 64 etc. Our hand is Qc Ks, so we have top pair Q but K kicker. Opponent could have Qx (pair of queens with better kicker maybe). Could have T? TT gives top two pair TQ? Actually TT would give pair of tens plus board pair of queens, so they'd have two pair (Tens and Queens). That's better than our Q pair? Actually two pair beats one pair. So TT beats us. Also 66 would give full house (6s over something). Actually board already has pair of 6s, so if opponent has a 6, they'd have full house 6s over whatever. That beats us. Also Q6 gives full house Q over 6? Wait board: Qd and we have Qc, board also has 6s pair. If opponent has Q6 they'd have two pair Q and 6, but board already has pair of 6s, so they'd have trips? Actually board: two 6s, one Q. If opponent has Q6, they'd have Q (pair with board) plus a 6 gives them trips 6? Let's compute: board: Th Qd 6s 4c 6d. So board has pair of 6s, plus T and Q. If opponent has Q6, they'd have a Q (pair with board Q) and a 6 (makes three of a kind 6s). So they'd have trips 6s with a queen kicker, which beats our pair of queens. So many combos beat us.\n\nWe bet heavily on flop and turn, and they called each time. That suggests they have strong hand, maybe a set or two pair or a draw they think is good. They might have 66 (set) which would be huge. They could also have Qx (top pair with good kicker). They could have T? TT would give two pair tens and queens, which is strong. They could have 64? 64 would give two pair 6 and 4? Actually board has 6 and 4, so 64 gives two pair (6s and 4s) plus a queen kicker? That would be two pair (6s and 4s) which is less than Q pair? Actually two pair beats one pair, so they'd beat us.\n\nGiven they called our bets, we should consider that they likely have a strong hand. Our hand is likely behind. We could check to see if they bet, but they have no action left (amount to call 0). We could check or raise. Raising might be risky; they could fold or call with worse. But they have shown willingness to call large bets. Could we value bet? Our hand is not best likely. So checking is safe. If we check, they might check back, we win the pot. If they bet, we can fold.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We'll check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Actually we have queen on board, we have queen in hand, so we have two pair? Wait board: Th Qd 6s 4c 6d. That's a pair of sixes and a queen on board. Our hand Qc Ks gives us pair of queens (queen on board + queen in hand) plus king kicker, plus the board also has a ten. So we have two pair: queens and sixes, with K kicker? Actually two pair: Qs and 6s, kicker K (since board also has Ten). So we have Q Q (pair) + 6 6 (pair). That's decent.\n\nOpponent (Seat2) bet 60 into pot 240+ previous bets? Let's compute pot: At river after turn betting: Preflop pot: blinds 1+2=3, plus raises etc. Let's compute: Preflop contributions: Seat2 raised to 6 (so 6 total?), seat3 call 6, seat4 call 5 (since they already posted small blind 1? Actually seat4 posted sb 1, seat5 posted bb 2. Preflop: seat2 raise 6 (so they put 6 total), seat3 call 6, seat4 call 5 (they had 1 posted, so add 5), seat5 call 4 (they had 2 posted, so add 2?). Wait seat5 call 4 means they put total 4? Actually they posted 2, call 4 means they add 2 more? Might be ambiguous. Anyway pot is 240 before river. Then flop: seat5 bet 12, seat2 call 12, seat3 call 12. So pot adds 12*3=36. Turn: seat5 bet 40, seat2 call 40, seat3 call 40: adds 120. So pot before river = 240 + 36 + 120 = 396? But given pot after turn maybe 240 includes those? The description says Pot: 240 chips (maybe current pot before river). Actually they list Pot: 240 chips at top of hand. That likely is pot size before river betting (i.e., after turn betting). So river: seat5 check, seat2 bet 60. So now pot is 240 + 60 = 300 (if call). Need to call 60.\n\nWe need to decide if we call, fold, or raise. Consider opponent tendencies. We have limited info: we can recall opponent actions. Let's query opponent seat2 actions."

Our stack 159, we can call 60 and still have 99 left. If we call and lose, we lose 60 and go to 99, still decent. If we fold, we lose 0 now but give opponent chips, they will be eliminated (since they have 13 left). Might be okay.\n\nOur hand: Qc Ks, board has Q and two sixes. Opponent could have 6x for trips, or a straight draw? Board: Th Qd 6s 4c 6d. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q? Not. 9-10-J-Q-K? No J missing. So straight not possible. Flush not possible (two spades, two clubs, two diamonds). So only made hands are pairs, two pair, trips, full house (if they have a 6 or Q). Opponent could have 6x for full house (6-6-6 + Q?). Actually board already has pair of sixes. If opponent has a 6, they'd have trips sixes, plus board Q, making trips. If opponent has Q, they'd have trips queens? Actually board has Q, they have Q, they'd have two queens (pair) not trips. So only trips if they have a six. Full house possible if they have 6 and another six? No only one six left (6c? board has 6s and 6d, missing 6h and 6c). If they have 6c they'd have three sixes (full house? Actually board has pair sixes, they have another six, making three of a kind sixes plus queen pair on board, that's a full house sixes full of queens? Wait board: Qd, Th, 6s, 4c, 6d. That's pair sixes and a queen. If opponent has a six, they'd have three sixes + queen = trips sixes with queen kicker, not full house because need pair on board of another rank. Actually board has Q, so they would have three sixes plus a queen, which is three of a kind, not full house. Full house would require them to have a queen (pair on board) plus a six (pair on board) => they'd need both Q and 6? Not possible. So best opponent could have is trips sixes (if they have a six) or maybe two pair (if they have something like 10-6?). Actually they could have 10-6 for full house? They would have 10 and 6, board has 10 and two sixes, they'd have three tens? No board only one ten. So not.\n\nThus our hand (two pair Qs and 6s) beats trips sixes? Actually trips sixes (three of a kind) beats two pair. So opponent could have trips sixes (if they hold a six). That beats us. Also opponent could have a higher two pair? They could have Qx with K kicker? Actually they could have QJ for two pair Q and 10? No board has 10, Q, 6, 6, 4. If they have T9 they'd have two pair tens and sixes? Actually board has ten, they have ten gives pair of tens plus pair sixes = two pair tens and sixes, which beats our queens and sixes? Compare: higher pair decides. Tens pair vs queens pair: queens higher, so our Qs and 6s beats tens and sixes. So opponent could have better two pair if they have Q with something else? They already have queen on board, they could have Q? That would be three of a kind queens? Actually board has Q, they have Q => pair queens (two queens) plus board pair sixes = two pair queens and sixes (same as us but kicker different). Our kicker K beats any other kicker. So if opponent has Qx, we tie maybe? If they have Q with K also? Not possible (we have K). So they could have QJ, they'd have Q pair same, kicker J vs K, we win.\n\nThus opponent's bet likely indicates they have a six (trips) or maybe a bluff. Since they are short stack, they might be shoving with any pair to try to double up.\n\nOur hand is decent but vulnerable to trips. We need to assess equity: If opponent has a six, probability they have a six given board: remaining deck unknown, but we can estimate. There are 2 sixes on board"

Actually we have queen on board, we have queen in hand, so we have two pair? Wait board: Th Qd 6s 4c 6d. That's a pair of sixes and a queen on board. Our hand Qc Ks gives us pair of queens (queen on board + queen in hand) plus king kicker, plus the board also has a ten. So we have two pair: queens and sixes, with K kicker? Actually two pair: Qs and 6s, kicker K (since board also has Ten). So we have Q Q (pair) + 6 6 (pair). That's decent.\n\nOpponent (Seat2) bet 60 into pot 240+ previous bets? Let's compute pot: At river after turn betting: Preflop pot: blinds 1+2=3, plus raises etc. Let's compute: Preflop contributions: Seat2 raised to 6 (so 6 total?), seat3 call 6, seat4 call 5 (since they already posted small blind 1? Actually seat4 posted sb 1, seat5 posted bb 2. Preflop: seat2 raise 6 (so they put 6 total), seat3 call 6, seat4 call 5 (they had 1 posted, so add 5), seat5 call 4 (they had 2 posted, so add 2?). Wait seat5 call 4 means they put total 4? Actually they posted 2, call 4 means they add 2 more? Might be ambiguous. Anyway pot is 240 before river. Then flop: seat5 bet 12, seat2 call 12, seat3 call 12. So pot adds 12*3=36. Turn: seat5 bet 40, seat2 call 40, seat3 call 40: adds 120. So pot before river = 240 + 36 + 120 = 396? But given pot after turn maybe 240 includes those? The description says Pot: 240 chips (maybe current pot before river). Actually they list Pot: 240 chips at top of hand. That likely is pot size before river betting (i.e., after turn betting). So river: seat5 check, seat2 bet 60. So now pot is 240 + 60 = 300 (if call).

          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 7c5d, stack 398, blinds 1/2. Action: SB posted 1, BB posted 2 (our blind). No other players in hand (others folded). So we are heads-up vs SB (seat1). Amount to call is 1 (to match SB's 1). Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to total 4). Hand 7c5d is weak, low suited connectors, not a good hand for raising. Considering tournament, stack 199 BB, still deep. Should we just call and see flop? In BB, we already have 2 chips in pot; calling 1 adds 1 more to pot. With such a weak hand, it's probably best to fold or call? Since we are out of position (SB is in position after flop), calling is cheap, could see flop cheap. But 7c5d is low, could flop something but low chance. In tournament early stage, preserving chips is important but also you can see cheap flops with weak hands. Many players would just call with any two cards in BB vs SB raise of 1. But SB posted 1, not raise. So it's just a blind vs blind. Actually SB posted 1 (small blind) and BB posted 2 (big blind). No raise. So it's just a limp call. We can check (since amount to call is 1, but we already have 2 in pot, we could check? Wait we are BB, we posted 2 already, SB posted 1. The amount to call is 1 to match SB's blind? But we already have 2 in pot, to call we need to put 1 more? Actually in blind scenario, the BB can check if no raise. But the system says amount to call: 1, meaning we need to call 1 to complete the bet? But the BB already posted 2, SB posted 1, so the BB is already ahead. Typically the BB can check (i.e., no further action) if no raise. But maybe the engine treats it as we need to call the SB's 1 to make it even. But we already have 2, which is more than SB's 1, so we are effectively \"overcall\"? Actually in many implementations, after blinds posted, the action starts to the left of BB; SB posts 1, then BB posts 2. Then action goes to UTG (but all folded), so it goes to SB, who can check or raise. Since SB has no raise, they check. Then action goes to BB, who can check (i.e., no bet). So amount to call should be 0. But the system says amount to call: 1. Possibly they treat it as we need to call SB's 1 to stay even? Not typical. But given legal actions include raise, call, fold, but not check. So we must either call 1 (add 1 more chip) or raise or fold. Since we are BB, we already have 2 in pot, calling 1 would make our total contribution 3, which is more than SB's 1. That seems odd. But we follow system: amount to call is 1. So we must decide.\n\nGiven hand is weak, I'd fold rather than call extra chip? But calling 1 is cheap, could see flop cheap. Many would just call. But we might want to preserve stack? 1 chip is negligible relative to 398. So call.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

We have 397 chips. Pot is 4 chips (small). Turn is Ad, which gives opponent maybe top pair (Aces) with Kc? Actually they have unknown hand. They checked preflop and flop. Likely they have a weak hand or drawing. Our pair of 5s is weak vs potential Ace or King. But we have a decent showdown value maybe if opponent is weak. But raising could win the pot. However we need to consider tournament: we have a short stack? Not really; 198 BB is huge. So we can be aggressive.\n\nBut we have only 4 chips in pot, raise minimum is 2 (to total 2?). Actually raise_to total amount. Minimum raise to 2 means total bet 2? Usually raise must be at least double the bet? But amount to call 0, so raise to at least 2 chips (i.e., bet 2). That would be small.\n\nWe could check and see what opponent does. Given they checked flop, maybe they have a marginal hand like Ace high, or maybe a draw.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: BB (seat5) with 7c5d. Board: Kc 8s 5c Ad. So we have a pair of fives (bottom pair) with a 5 on board, plus a backdoor straight draw? 7c 5d, board Kc 8s 5c Ad. We have a pair of fives, not strong. Opponent (Seat1) bet 3 into pot 7 (pot before bet is 7). So bet 3 makes pot 10 (including bet). Call 3 gives us pot odds: 3 into 10, about 23% needed. Our hand: pair of fives, but board has K high, Ace, 8. Opponent could have Ace, King, maybe a pair, maybe a draw. Our pair is low, likely losing. Could we have any outs? We could improve to two pair (5s with board? Actually we already have a pair of fives; board has also a 5c, we have 5d, so we have a set? Wait board: Kc 8s 5c Ad. There's a 5c on board, we have 5d, so we have a pair of fives, not a set. To get a set we need a 5, but only one 5 left (5h). So one out for set. Also could get straight? With 7c and board K,8,5,A, we need 6-9? Not possible. Flush? We have 7c and board has Kc and 5c, so two clubs on board, we have a club, that's three clubs, need one more club on river. There are many clubs left. So we have backdoor flush draw (needs two clubs? Actually we have 7c, board has Kc,5c, that's three clubs, we need one more club on river to make flush. So one club on river gives us flush. That's many outs (13 clubs total, we see 3, so 10 clubs left). Also straight draw? Not really.\n\nSo total outs maybe 1 set + 10 flush = 11 outs. Approx equity ~ 11*2/47 ~ 47%? Actually each out ~2% on turn, so about 22%? Wait we are on turn, one card to river. Outs 11, chance = 11/46 \u2248 23.9%. So equity ~24% plus maybe some combos where we already have best hand (pair of fives may be best if opponent has missed). But likely opponent has better.\n\nOpponent's bet size is small, could be a probe, could be a weak Ace or king. Could be a continuation bet with Ace high. Our hand is weak. Likely fold.\n\nCheck stack: 397 chips, bet 3 is tiny. Could call and see river, but risk losing more chips if opponent bets again. Might be okay to call given cheap call, but tournament considerations: we have decent stack, but we can preserve chips. However calling 3 with such weak hand may be okay. But we could also raise to protect? No, we have weak hand, raising would be silly.\n\nThus fold? But pot odds 3 into 10, we need 23% equity. Our equity maybe ~24% if we consider flush draw + set draw. But we also have chance to be best now (maybe opponent has missed). Our equity maybe slightly above 23% borderline. But opponent's bet indicates some strength, but small bet could be a probe. Could be a bluff.\n\nGiven we have a decent chance to improve to flush (10 outs) and set (1 out). So equity maybe 24% which is just above threshold. But we also have chance to win now if opponent has missed (like missed Ace, etc). So maybe call is justified.\n\nThus call. Provide reasoning.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to 6 (so raise to 6). Could raise to 6 (i.e., raise 3 more). But raising with weak hand is not good.\n\nThus call.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Wait small blind 1 from us, big blind 2 from opponent, we called 1 to match big blind (so we put total 2). So pot 1+2+2=5? Let's compute: SB 1 from us, BB 2 from opponent, we call 1 (so we put extra 1), total contributions: us 2 (1 sb + 1 call), opponent 2 (bb). So pot =4. Then flop: both checked, no chips. Turn: opponent bet 3, we called 3, adding 6 to pot, now pot =10. River: no bets yet. So pot 10, we have two pair, opponent's range? Opponent (Seat 1) is Kimi-K2, unknown tendencies. He bet 3 on turn after checking flop. That could be a value bet with Kx, Ace, maybe a draw? Board: Kc 8s 5c Ad Kd. Turn card? Not listed. Actually board includes turn and river? The board listed is all five cards. Turn was likely something that completed board? We don't know turn card but board final includes Kc 8s 5c Ad Kd. So turn card could be Kd? Actually board includes two kings, an Ace, a 5, an 8. So turn could be Kd, river could be something else. But we don't know which came when. However opponent bet 3 on turn; after that we called. So after turn, board had maybe Kc 8s 5c Ad (four cards). Then opponent bet 3, we called. Turn card likely was Kd? If turn was Kd, board after turn: Kc 8s 5c Ad Kd (two kings, Ace, 8, 5). That would give opponent a full house possibilities. But then river would be something else not shown? Actually board listed includes river card; but we don't know order. Could be turn was something else, river something else.\n\nGiven we have two pair, opponent could have a stronger hand: a set of Kings (if he has Kx), a set of Aces (if he has A?), a full house (if he has Kx or Ax). Also could have a straight? Board: K 8 5 A K. No straight possible. Flush? No two clubs: Kc, 5c, plus maybe clubs? Our hand has 7c, so we have three clubs (Kc,5c,7c). Opponent could have two clubs for a flush if river is club? But board already has two clubs, need three clubs on board for flush, not possible. So no flush.\n\nThus opponent likely has a stronger hand if he has a King (makes trips or full house if also has another King). Or Ace (makes pair of Aces). Our two pair is moderate. We need to decide whether to bet/raise or check. Our stack is 394 chips, pot 10, we are deep. River betting: we could check and hope to win at showdown; we likely are behind many of opponent's value hands. Check is safe.\n\nCould we raise as a bluff? Opponent just bet on turn, we called. He might be weak, but we have two pair. Raising could extract value if opponent has a weaker hand like King-high? But board has Kc and Kd, so opponent likely has at least King. If opponent has just K high (no pair), they'd have a pair of Kings (top pair) which is still better than our two pair?

Our hand currently: we have a pair of fives, but board has pair of kings (two kings) and an ace. So our best five-card hand: K K A 8 5? Actually we have 5c on board and 5d in hand, so we have trips? Wait board: Kc 8s 5c Ad Kd. That's two kings, an ace, an eight, a five. Our hand: 7c 5d. The board already has a five (5c). So we have a pair of fives (our 5d + board 5c) = pair of fives, not trips. There's also two kings on board, so the board's two pair is Kings and Fives? Actually board has K K A 8 5, that's one pair of kings, not two pair because only one five on board. So board's best is pair of kings with Ace kicker. Our hand adds a second five making a pair of fives, but we still only have pair of kings on board, we have pair of fives, but the board's pair of kings outranks our pair of fives. So we are currently behind unless we have a full house or something. We have no straight, no flush (board has clubs: Kc, 5c; we have 7c, so we have three clubs total, not flush). No straight possibilities: board ranks K,8,5,A,K. Our 7 and 5 gives possible straight 5-6-7-8-9? Not there. So we are weak.\n\nOpponent (Seat 1) bet 7 into pot 17, after we checked river. So they are betting. Likely they have a strong hand: maybe king, ace, maybe a full house (K K something). Let's consider possible holdings: They could have Kx (king) for top pair, maybe KQ, KJ, KT, KA (but board already has Ace). Actually board has Ace, so a hand with Ace could be a pair of Aces (but board already has Ace). If they have A K they'd have two pair (Aces and Kings) or maybe a full house? Let's see: board: K K A 8 5. If they have A K, they'd have two pair Aces and Kings with kicker? Actually they'd have A A K K 8 (two pair Aces and Kings). That's strong. If they have K K they'd have trips (three kings) but board already has two kings, they'd have three of a kind kings (full house? Actually three kings + Ace + 8). That's also strong. If they have 5x they'd have trips fives? No board has one five, they'd have two fives, making three of a kind fives, but still weaker than Kings. They could have a full house like K K K something? Actually need three of a kind plus a pair. If they have K K they'd have three kings (full house? Actually they'd have three kings plus Ace and 8, that's just three of a kind). To have full house they'd need board to have a pair and they have a pair: board has pair of Kings, they could have 5 5 to make full house (Kings full of Fives). But board only has one 5, they need two 5s, not possible because only one 5 left (our 5d). Actually there are four 5s total, board has 5c, we have 5d, opponent could have 5h or 5s. If they have 5h, they'd have two pair (Kings and Fives) plus Ace kicker. Not full house.\n\nFull house possibilities: Opponent could have K K (makes three Kings) but board has two Kings already, so they'd have three Kings, not full house. To have full house they'd need board to have a pair and they have a pair of a different rank. Board has pair of Kings, they could have pair of something else, e.g., 8 8 would give Kings full of eights? Actually board: K K A 8 5. If they have 8 8 they'd have Kings full of eights (KKK88). That's a full house. Similarly if they have 5 5 they'd have Kings full of fives (KKK55). Or if they have A A they'd have Aces full of Kings (AAA KK). Many possibilities. So opponent likely has strong hand.\n\nOur hand is weak. We should consider folding. However we need to consider stack sizes: we have 394 chips, opponent 199 chips"

Minimum raise to 44 (i.e., raise to at least 44 total). Stack 392, deep.\n\nWe need to consider hand strength: KTh offsuit is decent but not premium. In SB facing a 3-bet from seat2 (likely short stack? seat2 has 61 chips). Actually seat2 stack 61 chips, so they are short. They raised to 26 (13 big blinds). That's a sizable raise for a short stack; likely they are trying to go all-in or have a strong hand. Our stack is large, but we are out of position post-flop (SB will be first to act post-flop). Opponent seat2 likely is a short stack, maybe they want to steal or they have a strong hand. KTh is not a good 3-bet call vs a short stack raising big.\n\nWe could fold. Could also call? Let's consider pot odds: current pot before our decision: pot includes blinds (1+2) + our call 2 + raise 8 + re-raise 26 = 39? Actually pot shown is 39. To call 24, pot will become 63. So pot odds 24/63 = 38% to win. KTh vs unknown range of short stack's 3-bet (maybe wide but includes many strong hands). KTh off-suit likely not >38% equity vs typical 3-bet range.

That's a low pair, but board has two Aces, so opponent likely has Ace or better. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has been checking all streets. Preflop they called 1 (small blind) after posting SB? Wait: preflop: Seat 4 post_sb 1, Seat5 post_bb2, then seat4 call1. So MiniMax-M2 was SB, called 1 (i.e., limped). Then both checked flop, turn, river. So they have a weak hand or a draw that missed. Our hand is 3d8h, we have a pair of threes, which is likely the best hand? But board has two Aces, so any Ace in opponent's hand would give them a higher pair (pair of Aces). Also any pair of 5,6, or 3? They could have 5 or 6 for a set? But they'd have likely bet. They just checked. So likely they have nothing, maybe a low kicker, maybe a straight draw missed. So our pair of threes is likely the best. Pot is 4 chips (tiny). We have 390 chips, deep. We could check, but maybe we can try to steal a tiny amount? Minimum raise to 2, which is 2 chips total. That would be a raise of 2 (i.e., put in 2 chips). That would be a value bet of 2 into 4 pot, giving us 2 profit if called. Opponent may call with a missed draw? They might call with Ace-high? But they'd likely fold to any bet, given they checked everything. So we could raise to 2 to get a small win. However, is there any risk? If they have an Ace, they'd call and beat us. But they likely would have bet earlier. So maybe safe to check.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: we have big stack, no need to risk. Checking is fine. But a small value bet might be good to extract chips from weak draws. But the raise amount is only 2 total (i.e., you put in 2 chips). That is 50% of pot, decent. If they call, they'd lose 2 chips net. If they fold, we win 4. I'd lean to raise to 2 for value.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise_to should be total amount: 2. Reason: we have best hand, opponent likely weak, small value bet.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 2, reasoning.\n\n"

That's a low pair, but board has two Aces, so opponent likely has Ace or better. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has been checking all streets. Preflop they called 1 (small blind) after posting SB? Wait: preflop: Seat 4 post_sb 1, Seat5 post_bb2, then seat4 call1. So MiniMax-M2 was SB, called 1 (i.e., limped). Then both checked flop, turn, river. So they have a weak hand or a draw that missed. Our hand is 3d8h, we have a pair of threes, which is likely the best hand? But board has two Aces, so any Ace in opponent's hand would give them a higher pair (pair of Aces). Also any pair of 5,6, or 3? They could have 5 or 6 for a set? But they'd have likely bet. They just checked. So likely they have nothing, maybe a low kicker, maybe a straight draw missed. So our pair of threes is likely the best. Pot is 4 chips (tiny). We have 390 chips, deep. We could check, but maybe we can try to steal a tiny amount? Minimum raise to 2, which is 2 chips total. That would be a raise of 2 (i.e., put in 2 chips). That would be a value bet of 2 into 4 pot, giving us 2 profit if called. Opponent may call with a missed draw? They might call with Ace-high? But they'd likely fold to any bet, given they checked everything. So we could raise to 2 to get a small win. However, is there any risk? If they have an Ace, they'd call and beat us. But they likely would have bet earlier. So maybe safe to check.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: we have big stack, no need to risk. Checking is fine. But a small value bet might be good to extract chips from weak draws. But the raise amount is only 2 total (i.e., you put in 2 chips). That is 50% of pot, decent. If they call, they'd lose 2 chips net. If they fold, we win 4. I'd lean to raise to 2 for value.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise_to should be total amount: 2. Reason: we have best hand, opponent likely weak, small value bet.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 2, reasoning.\n\n",

Our hand QT suited? Actually Qs Td unsuited (spades and diamonds). So QT offsuit. In BB vs raise, QTo is marginal. With deep stack, could consider 3-bet as semi-bluff if we have fold equity. But position is BB out of position. Opponent is UTG? Actually seat2 is after seat1 (big blind). Seats: 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (maybe UTG?), seat2 is Kimi-K2 (maybe UTG+1). Not sure.\n\nGiven stack deep, but we are out of position, QTo is not a strong candidate to 3-bet unless we think opponent is weak and can fold. But we have limited info. Probably best to call? But calling with QTo off-suit out of position is also risky; could be dominated by better combos. Usually you fold QTo in BB vs raise unless you have a good read. So likely fold.\n\nPot odds: need to call 5 to win pot of 9+6? Actually pot currently 9 (blinds) + raise 6 = 15? Wait: preflop: seat5 post sb 1 (small blind?), seat1 post bb 2 (big blind). Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Wait they said Position: BB (Seat5). So seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? But they posted sb 1 (so seat5 posted sb 1?) That's weird. Let's interpret: seat5 posted sb 1 (so seat5 is SB) and seat1 posted bb 2 (so seat1 is BB). But they said our position BB seat5. So maybe they reversed. Anyway, the pot is 9 chips. Then seat2 raises to 6 (so adds 4 more? Actually raise to 6 means total bet 6, so call 5). So pot now 9+? The raise adds 4 extra from previous bet of 2? Hard.\n\nNevertheless, call 5 for pot ~?

With 96 BB stack, standard raise to 3x BB = 12 is common. Minimum raise is 8 (to 8 total). Raise to 8 is a small raise, could be seen as weak. Could also just call (flat) 4, but flatting UTG is generally not advisable unless you have a strong hand. QT suited is decent but not strong enough to flat UTG. Raising is better to thin the field and get value. Opponent Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) is SB with 221 chips. Past behavior: they've raised preflop with 35 (hand 21), raised with 12 (hand 25). They also folded preflop multiple times. They called on later streets. They seem to be able to raise with decent hands, maybe medium strength. So raising to 8 (small) may invite a 3-bet? But they are short stack 221 chips, but still have enough. Our stack is 387, we could raise to say 12 (3x BB) which is above min raise. Legal actions: raise, call, fold. We can raise to any amount above min raise? Usually raise to any amount >= min raise. So we can raise to 12, 16, etc. With 96 BB, typical raise 2.5-3 BB preflop UTG = 10-12. Let's raise to 12. Reasoning: hand strength moderate, want to thin field, avoid multi-way pot. Also position early, want to be aggressive. Also tournament stack moderate, we can afford raise. So decision: raise to 12.\n\nCheck legal: raise_to = total amount we put in. Currently we need to call 4, raise to 12 means we put 12 total (including call). Good.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Hand Ah9 suited is decent but not premium. In early position? Opponent is in seat3 (UTG? Seats: seat1,2,3,4,5... we are seat5 BB, seat4 SB, seat3 is UTG? Actually seats: seat1 is under the gun? Let's assume seat3 is UTG+1 maybe. Anyway they raised 12. Should we call? A9s vs raise from early position. In tournament with 97 BB, still deep. A9s is a decent hand for a call, but also can be played 3-bet. Opponent's raise size is 12 (3BB). We could 3-bet to maybe 30-35 to isolate. But we are out of position (BB vs UTG). However A9s is not a strong hand to 3-bet out of position, but could be used as a steal if we think they are weak. Opponent's raise patterns: they've raised amounts 12, 12, 16, 18. So they sometimes raise larger. Probably a standard raise. So call is reasonable to see flop with A9s. Pot odds: call 8 to win 18+8=26 pot? Actually pot before action 18, opponent raised to 12, so pot now 18+8 (call) = 26? Wait initial pot: 2+4 =6? Actually blinds 2/4, pot 18 chips includes blinds and maybe previous? The pot listed is 18. So call 8 adds to pot making 26. So odds ~8/26 = 30.8% needed to break even. A9s vs unknown range maybe ~20% equity preflop. Might be a bit under. But could be okay to call.\n\nConsider tournament: 97 BB, we have decent stack. Could also raise to 30 to take initiative. But raising out of position with A9s might be risky; if they 4-bet, we are in trouble. But they are early and may not 4-bet often. However 4-bet range likely strong.\n\nThus likely best to call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\n",

Actually seat 3 unknown position. Could be early position. Raising 12 (3bb) from presumably UTG or MP. Likely they have broadway combos, pocket pairs, suited connectors, etc. On flop and turn they checked both. Board didn't change much.

No pair, no straight draws. Straight possibilities? Board: T,3,8,6,2. Our 9 gives potential straight 6-7-8-9-T? But we lack 7. No. Ace high. Opponent (Seat 3) bet 8 into pot 34, so pot will be 42 after call. Call 8 gives pot odds 8/(34+8)=8/42=19% approx. Need equity >19% to call. Our hand likely weak. Opponent's range: They raised preflop to 12 (3bb) from seat 3 (likely UTG? Not sure). They called our BB. So they likely have a range of strong hands: maybe broadway, pairs, suited connectors, etc. Flop and turn checks both. River bet 8 small. Could be a bluff or value with weak pair like 8,6,3,2, T? Actually board has no pair, they could have made pair on river like 8? But they'd have had pair earlier. Could be a missed draw, they might bluff. But our hand is Ace high, not likely to win. Let's consider opponent's possible holdings: Could have Ace with something, but they'd have Ace high anyway. Could have KQ, QJ, etc. Could have a missed draw like 7-9 (makes straight 6-7-8-9-T). Actually 7-9 would have made straight on river (7 on board? No 7 not on board). Straight would be 6-7-8-9-T, we have 9, board has 6,8,T, need 7. Opponent could have 7? If they have 7x, they'd have straight on river. So they'd bet for value. Our Ace high loses. Could have pair of 2,3,6,8,10. They could have 10x (makes pair of tens) they'd have top pair, they'd bet. So likely we are behind. Small bet could be a bluff with missed draws like JQ, QK, etc. But equity still low. Should we call? Maybe fold.\n\nStack: we have 381 chips, can call 8 easily. No all-in.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

But facing a raise from seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) with 73 chips (short stack). He is short (73 chips) relative to blinds 2/4, effective stack maybe 73. He raised to 12 (3x big blind). That is a typical raise for a short stack, maybe he is trying to steal. 7T suited is decent but not premium. Considering his short stack, he could be shoving soon. We have deep stack, can call and see flop. But we need to consider implied odds: 7T suited can flop many draws, but also can be dominated by higher suited connectors or pairs. Also his raise size is small (3x). Calling 8 is cheap. Could also raise to isolate? Raise to 20 minimum. If we raise to 20, we would be 20 total, which is 5x BB. That might isolate and we could have position preflop? Actually after raise, we would be the raiser, and then seat1 would have to act again. He may call or re-raise (unlikely). But raising might be good to get value if he has a hand like A2, K2, etc. But 7T suited is not strong enough to re-raise for value. Likely best to call and see flop. Also note his stack is short; if we call, we will have a big effective stack relative to him. He may go all-in later. But we can call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nWe need JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with 7h Ts. Board: Kd Ah 5c. Opponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, 57 chips left (short stack). He raised preflop to 12 (from 4 to 12? Actually raise to 12 total, meaning he put in 12, you called 8). So pot after preflop: 2 (SB) +4 (BB) +8 call +12 raise = 26? Wait compute: SB 2, BB 4 posted, then you call 2 (makes 4 total), seat1 raise to 12 (so adds 8 more), you call 8 (makes your total 12). So total pot = 2+4+12+12 = 30? Actually each contributed: SB 2, BB 4+8 =12, seat1 12. Sum = 2+12+12 =26? Let's recount: Preflop actions: SB (seat5) posts 2, BB (seat1) posts 4, seat2 fold, seat3 fold, seat4 fold, seat5 call 2 (so adds 2 more to make 4 total), seat1 raise 12 (so puts total 12, meaning additional 8), seat5 call 8 (adds 8 to make total 12). So contributions: seat5 total 12, seat1 total 12, plus SB 2? Wait SB is seat5, already accounted. The BB is seat1? Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, but position says \"Your Position: BB (Seat5)\". So seat1 is UTG? Actually seat1 posted BB 4, so seat1 is BB? But they said your position BB seat5. So seat1 posted BB? The description seems contradictory. However we treat seat1 as opponent who posted BB 4 then raised. So pot after preflop: seat5 (you) contributed 12, seat1 contributed 12, plus small blind? Actually small blind is you (seat5) posted 2, then called 2 to match big blind 4? Wait typical: SB 2, BB 4. You are BB, you posted 4. Then you also posted SB 2? No you can't be both. Something off. But pot given is 40 chips on flop. So pot 40 includes contributions. We'll trust pot 40.\n\nNow flop: Kd Ah 5c. You have 7h Ts, which gives you a gutshot straight draw (needs 9 for 9-T-J-Q-K? Actually board: K A 5, you have T,7. You have open-ended? Not. Straight possibilities: 9-10-J? Board has A,K,5. With T you have Broadway draw? Need Q J 9? Not. Actually you have Ten, board has Ace and King, you have gutshot to a straight with 9? Ten with Ace high no straight. So only draw is a gutshot to a straight with 9 (9-10-J-Q-K) but you need J and Q and 9, not likely. Also you have backdoor flush draw? You have hearts 7h, board has hearts? No hearts on board. So no flush draw.\n\nYour hand is basically overcards (A,K on board). You have Ten, which is lower than both. So you have basically nothing, likely losing. Opponent bet 16 into pot 40 (pot after flop before bet is 40). So bet size 16 is about 0.4 pot. You have 363 chips stack. Opponent short stack 57 chips left (including his bet?). He bet 16, so his remaining stack after bet is 57-16=41. So he is short. He may be betting as a value bet with Ace high? He might have A-K, A-x, etc. Could be a bluff? But short stack may be trying to steal or push.\n\nYour hand is weak. Likely fold. But consider pot odds: you need to call 16 to win 40+16=56 pot? Actually after call, pot would be 40+16+16=72. So you need to call 16 to win 72, odds 16/72 = 22%. Your hand's equity is likely far less than 22% (maybe 10% max). So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nWe need to output JSON.\n\n",

We are BTN, after SB and BB posted, we act. 7h8s suited? No, hearts and spades, unsuited. Off-suit 7-8. Position is best, but hand is mediocre. In tournament early stage? Stack 363 is 90 BB, deep. Opponents: seat1 95 chips (short stack), seat2 249 chips (mid). SB 95 is short; could be shoving soon. We could consider raising to isolate or call. 7-8 offsuit is a speculative hand; not great for raising but can be used to steal blinds. However there is a short stack in SB, they might call all-in if raise. But they have only 95 chips, which is about 23 BB. If we raise to 8 min raise, they'd need 4 more to call, they'd have 91 left. Could they go all-in? They could but would be risking all. Might be okay to raise to 8 (i.e., 8 total) to try to steal. But 7-8 offsuit is not strong enough to open raise? Usually you raise with a range of about 20% on button, includes suited connectors, but offsuit 7-8 is borderline. Could also just call 4, see flop cheap. Pot odds: call 4 to see flop, pot 6+4=10, effective odds 4/10 = 40% needed to break even. Hand equity vs two unknown? Might be okay to limp? But limping is suboptimal. Better to raise or fold. Considering short stack SB might fold to raise, BB may call. If we raise to 8, we risk facing 4 from BB (call) and 4 from SB (call) making pot 6+8+4+4 = 22. Our equity with 7-8 offsuit vs two random hands maybe ~30%? Not enough. So maybe fold. However we could also just call 4 and see flop cheap, maybe hit straight draws.\n\nGiven we have deep stack, we can afford to see flop. But calling 4 adds 4 to pot, we have 363 left.

          "reasoning_content": "We have 7h8s on BTN, facing a raise to 12 (from 4 to 12? Actually raise amount is 12 total? The raise is 12 chips total, meaning they put in 12? The amount to call is 8 (they raised 12, you called 4 initially). So you need to call 8 to see flop. Minimum raise to 20 (so raise would be to 20 total). Stack 359, deep.\n\n7-8 suited is a decent speculative hand, especially in position, but it's not a premium hand. In a tournament with 89.8 BB, you can be a bit aggressive but need to consider opponent Kimi-K2's tendencies. From recall: Kimi-K2 has raised 12 in hand 31,32,33. In hand 33 they raised 75 (big raise). So they may be capable of larger raises, but also they folded many preflop raises? Actually they raised 12 three times, but also folded many times preflop (folded in earlier hands). So they may be a tight-ish player who raises when they have decent hands. 7-8 suited is marginal; calling a raise of 12 (3x BB) is okay in position, but could be risky if they are tight. However 7-8 suited can flop well, and you have implied odds. Stack depth is high, can call.\n\nPot odds: pot currently 18 + 12 (their raise) + 4 (your call) = 34? Actually after raise, pot is 18 (original) + 12 (raise) + 4 (your call) = 34. To call 8, you invest 8 to win 34 (including your 8). So pot odds = 8/(34) = 23.5% needed. 7-8 suited has about 12% chance to hit a flush draw, etc. Might be okay.\n\nGiven position and hand, calling is reasonable. Raising would be too aggressive, likely not good.\n\nThus action: call.\n\n",

Pot currently 56 (SB posted 2, BB posted 4, plus raises). Actions: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, Seat2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (so min raise to 12?). Actually raise from 4 to 12 is raise of 8, but they call it raise 12 (total). Then Seat3 folded, Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 38. So they re-raised (3-bet) to 38. Amount to call is 36 (i.e., need to add 36 more to match 38, because we already posted 2). Minimum raise to: 64 (so if we raise, must raise to at least 64 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call 38, or raise to at least 64. Hand is AJo in SB facing a 3-bet from MiniMax-M2 (seat4) after a raise from Kimi-K2 (seat2). Stack sizes: Kimi-K2 253 chips, MiniMax-M2 135 chips, us 345, BB seat1 91 chips.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall MiniMax-M2 raise patterns: only one raise found: hand 14 preflop raise amount 4 (tiny raise). That's not much info. Kimi-K2 raise patterns: many raises of 12, 18, 26, etc. Not huge.\n\nWe have limited info. Our hand AJo is decent but not premium. In SB, out of position. Facing 3-bet from MiniMax-M2 with 135 chips (approx 33 BB). They could be shoving? Actually they raised to 38, which is about 9.5 BB (since big blind is 4). 38/4 = 9.5 BB. That's a sizable 3-bet.\n\nOur stack 86 BB, we could call 36 more (to 38 total). That would be about 9.5 BB call, leaving us with ~76 BB after call. Is that advisable? AJo vs unknown range. Could be okay to call if we think they are 3-betting light. But being out of position, maybe better to fold unless we have a good read.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 only one raise recorded (4). That suggests they rarely 3-bet? Could be that they are tight and only raise small amounts. But we have no info on their 3-bet frequency.\n\nKimi-K2's raise to 12 (initial raise). They are medium stack 253. Their raise size 12 (3 BB). That's a standard open.\n\nMiniMax-M2's 3-bet to 38 is large (approx 9.5 BB). Could be a strong hand (AA, KK, AK, maybe AQ). Our AJo is not top 5% but still decent.\n\nWe also have to consider tournament: stack 86 BB, not short. Could afford to fold.\n\nThus likely fold.\n\nBut also could consider calling and seeing flop, but out of position.\n\nGiven limited info, I'd fold.\n\nLet's produce JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop with 9h Jh on button, stacks: us 345, SB 2, BB 4, others folded. Opponent seats: seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is SB with 89 chips, seat2 (Kimi-K2) is BB with 249 chips.\n\nWe are BTN, after SB and BB posted, it's our turn. Amount to call is 4 (BB). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to total 8). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand: 9h Jh \u2013 suited connectors, decent hand on button, can open raise. Stack 86 BB, deep enough. Opponents: SB (89 chips, 22.25 BB) is short stack; BB (249 chips, 62 BB). Need to consider opponent tendencies: recall shows seat1 (SB) raised preflop in some past hands, amounts 6,12,12,16,12. So they are aggressive, maybe 3-bet? In those hands they raised from SB (post sb 2) to amount 6 (i.e., raise to 6) which is 3x SB? Actually raise to 6 means they raised to total 6, so 4 over call. That's a 3-bet? Wait initial bet is BB 4, call would be 4, raise to 8 minimum. So raise to 6 is below min raise? Not possible. Maybe they raised from SB after posting 2, before BB? Actually order: SB posts 2, then BB posts 4, then action goes to UTG etc. But in this scenario, only SB and BB present. But recall may be from other tables where there were more players; anyway SB shows raises preflop, maybe 3-bets or open raises.\n\nSeat2 (BB) no data. Might be tighter.\n\nGiven we are on button, 9hJh is a good raise. Also we have a short stack behind (SB 89 chips). If we raise to 8, SB may call or shove (since 89 chips). 8 is small relative to SB's stack, they could go all-in. But raising too small may invite call and we might get in a multiway pot with a weak hand vs stronger ranges. However 9hJh is decent for 3-bet? Could also consider 3-bet (re-raise) to isolate SB? But we are first to act after blinds, so it's open raise. Could also consider a limp? Not advisable with suited connectors.\n\nThus raise to 8 (minimum raise) seems fine. Reason: we want to build pot, take advantage of position, and pressure short stack.\n\nCheck if we can raise more. Minimum raise 8, we could raise to e.g., 15. But deeper stacks can call, but we might want to size to isolate SB. SB has 89 chips, they'd likely call a raise of 15? Might still call. A larger raise might discourage call but also risk being re-raised by BB (big stack) who could have a strong hand.\n\nGiven tournament early stage, we can raise to 12 (3x BB) to apply pressure. But legal minimum raise is 8, we can raise higher. However we need to consider pot odds: if BB calls, we will be in 3-way with 9hJh vs unknown ranges. Might be okay.\n\nGiven our hand is decent but not premium, a standard raise to 8 (2x BB) is fine to see flop.\n\nThus choose raise to 8.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

In early position, typical strategy is to fold unless you have a reason to raise. With 44 BB stack, could consider a steal? But UTG raise with A5 offsuit is not standard; risk of being dominated by higher Aces, also low kicker.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: Seat2 is SB with 245 chips, maybe a short stack? Actually 245 is about 30 BB. Could be looking to shove? But we are UTG, we could just call to see flop cheap? However calling 8 into a pot of 12 (effective 2x) is 2:1 pot odds, but we will be out of position postflop. A5 offsuit has low equity vs typical ranges.\n\nBetter to fold.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. I'd fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Hand is suited broadway, decent but not premium. Stack is decent. Opponents: seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised previously? Actually actions: seat3 posted small blind 4, seat4 posted big blind 8. So we are first to act after blinds? UTG is seat5, after SB and BB, action goes to UTG first. So amount to call is 8 (big blind). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek raises often preflop with amounts 12,16,18,32. That's about 1.5-4 BB raises (big blind 8). So they raise larger sometimes. They are seat3 (SB) but not relevant now. MiniMax seat4 is BB, hasn't acted yet. We are UTG. Should we open raise? Standard UTG open range is tight: maybe top 10%: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ. KJ suited is borderline, often not opened UTG in tournament early stages, especially with 44 BB stack? Might be okay to limp? But limp (call) is not recommended in early position; better to fold or raise. Since we have 44 BB, we could raise to 3-4 BB (24-32). Minimum raise is 16 (2 BB). Could raise to 24 (3 BB). That would be standard.\n\nBut consider stack depth: 44 BB, we could open for 3 BB to build pot. Opponents may call or re-raise. Our hand has good equity vs many hands, especially suited. Could also consider 3-bet if someone raises, but no raise yet.\n\nThus decision: raise to 24 (3 BB). Reason: decent hand, position early, want to thin field, build pot, have enough stack.\n\nCheck if any reason to fold: KJs is not premium UTG but still playable. In tournament early, we might be cautious. But with 44 BB, we can afford to open.\n\nThus action: raise to 24.",

So we are first to act on flop (since we are BB, but preflop we raised, now flop we act first). Board: 9s 3d 8h. Our hand: Ks Js. So we have open-ended straight draw (7-10). Actually we have gutshot? Let's see: board 9,3,8. We have K,J. Straight possibilities: 7-8-9-10-J gives us gutshot? Actually we have J, board has 9 and 8, missing 10 for open-ended? We have J, need 10 for straight J-10-9-8-7? Wait need 7-8-9-10-J. We have J, board 8,9, need 7 and 10. That's two outs for open-ended? Actually we have two ways: need 7 or 10. So we have 8 outs (four 7s and four 10s) = 8 outs. That's decent.\n\nWe also have backdoor flush draws? Suits: board spade 9s, hearts 8h, diamonds 3d. Our hand: Ks (spade), Js (spade). So we have two spades, board has one spade, so we have a flush draw with 2 spades in hand, need two more spades on turn and river. That's 9 outs (remaining spades = 11? Actually there are 13 spades total, we have 2, board has 1, so 10 left. But two needed, probability lower). So decent equity.\n\nPot is 60, we have 327 stack. Opponent stack 221. No bet yet on flop. We can check or bet/raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise (minimum raise to 16). Since we are first to act, we can bet (raise). Should we bet? With open-ended straight draw and flush draw, we have decent equity, but we also have backdoor possibilities. Opponent may have made a pair (9,8,3) etc. We could bet to protect and build pot. Our stack is decent relative to pot. Minimum raise 16, which is 2.5BB? Actually blind 4/8, raise to 24 preflop, pot 60 includes our raise (24+24+8?). Let's compute: preflop: SB 4, BB 8, we raise to 24, opponent calls 24. So pot after preflop = 4+8+24+24 = 60. Yes.\n\nNow flop: we can bet 16 (to 76 total). That is about 1/3 pot. That could be a continuation bet. Our hand has good draw, we want to see cheap turn. Betting also protects against draws. Opponent may call with any pair, or raise with strong. We have decent stack, can call raise.\n\nGiven tournament stage (we have 40 BB, opponent 27.6 BB). We want to preserve chips but also accumulate. I think a continuation bet of 16 is good.\n\nThus action: raise to 76? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raise to 16 means total bet of 16? Minimum raise to 16 means we need to put 16 chips total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in, not additional. Since no bet, raise to 16 means we bet 16 chips. But is that allowed? Minimum raise to 16, so we can raise to 16. That would be a small bet ~0.27 pot. Might be too small. But we can raise more, up to any amount. Maybe raise to 30? Let's choose raise to 30 (approx half pot). That is a decent continuation bet.\n\nCheck? Could also check to see opponent's action, but we have strong draw, we want to get value if opponent has pair. But also risk of giving free cards. I think bet.\n\nThus output: raise to 30.\n\nReasoning: open-ended straight draw, flush draw, want to build pot, protect, etc.\n\n"

We have KJ, no pair, no flush draw (two spades on board? board has spade 9 and spade 5, we have spade K and J, so we have 4 spades total, need one more for flush, but there are 2 spades on board, we have 2 spades, that's 4 spades, need 1 more for flush, but only one more spade on board? Actually board spades: 9s, 5s. Our spades: K\u2660, J\u2660. So we have 4 spades total, need one more spade on river to make flush. Straight draw? We have KJ, board 9-8-5-3. If a 7 appears, we get 5-7-8-9? Actually need 7 for 5-6-7-8-9? Not. Straight possibilities: 7 would give 5-6-7-8-9? No 6 missing. 6 would give 5-6-7-8-9? No 7 missing. So no straight draw. So currently we have high cards, K high, J kicker. Opponent seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has called preflop and flop. Pot is 120. Turn action: we are in BB, we acted preflop raise, flop bet, opponent called. Now turn: amount to call 0, so we are first to act? Actually after flop, opponent called, now turn action: it's our turn? Since we are seat 5 (BB) and opponent seat 2 is after us? The order: seat 5 (us) raised preflop, seat 2 called, flop bet by us, seat 2 called, now turn. So it's our turn to act first (since we were first to bet flop). So we have option to check or raise. Opponent's stack 191, ours 297. Opponent's tendencies unknown. Should we bet? We have no made hand, only potential flush draw. Might be a good spot to bluff? Turn board: 9s 3d 8h 5s. It's a relatively dry board, no pairs on board, no straight possibilities. Opponent likely has a hand like 9x, 8x, 5x, maybe a pair. Could be a weak hand. We could attempt a continuation bet (c-bet) to take pot. Our raise would be minimum raise to 30 (i.e., raise to 30 total? Actually minimum raise to 30 means raise amount total 30? The legal raise amount: currently amount to call 0, so we can bet 30 (minimum raise). So we could bet 30. That would be 30 into 120 pot, about 1/4 pot. That seems small. Might be okay as a probe. But we could also check and see river. Considering tournament, we have decent stack 37 BB, not short. Might want to preserve chips. Opponent may have called flop with a marginal hand, but we could try to take pot now. The opponent's previous actions: they called our flop bet, indicating maybe they have a hand that likes board (maybe a 9, 8, 5, or a gutshot). Could be a pair of 9s? But board no pair. Could be a straight draw like 7-6? Actually board 9-8-5-3, 7-6 would give 5-6-7-8-9, yes that is a straight! Wait we have 5-8-9, missing 6 and 7. So 7-6 would give straight. So opponent could have 7-6. They called flop bet with that draw? Possibly. So they might have a draw. Our raise may push them out. But we also have a flush draw, but not strong. Might consider check to see river card. River could be spade for flush, or 7/6 for straight. But we don't have any pair, so maybe check.\n\nGiven the situation, likely best to check, see river, then decide. The pot is 120, we have 297 left. Checking is safe.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nWe need JSON with raise_to null.\n\n",

Should we raise? With 6c Tc, it's a marginal hand. In BB vs SB, typical strategy: raise with a wide range, especially since SB only called. However 6cTc is not a strong hand; many players would just check and see flop for cheap. But raising could isolate and take down pot. Since SB just called, they likely have a wide range (maybe any pair, suited connectors, etc). Raising to 16 (8 more) is small, could be a standard raise. If they call, we see flop. If they re-raise, we can fold.\n\nGiven our hand, maybe we check and see flop cheap. But we are out of position after flop, but still can see flop cheap.\n\nConsider tournament: 36 BB, not short.

We have Tc (clubs), so we have a nut flush draw? The highest club on board is Kc, we have Tc, so we have the nut flush draw (Ace-high flush not possible because Ace not on board; we have Ten of clubs, board Kc and 6c, we need any club higher than Ten? Actually flush draws: we need 5 clubs. Currently we have two clubs (Kc, 6c, Tc). Need 2 more clubs. The highest possible flush would be Ace-high, but we have Ten, so the best possible flush we could make is Ten-high? Wait flush ranking uses highest card in flush. Since we have Ten of clubs, if we hit flush, the highest club among board+our hand will be Ten (if board has Kc, that is higher than Ten, but Kc is already on board; flush would be Kc, Tc, plus three other clubs. The highest club is Kc, which is on board, so we would have King-high flush, which is the best possible flush given board includes King of clubs.

We have a good draw (nut flush) and a pair. Should we bet? We are in BB, out of position. Flop is relatively dry except for clubs. We have good equity. Betting could protect against draws? Opponent may have Kx, or a draw. Checking might allow free cards, but also gives opponent chance to check-raise? Not likely.\n\nGiven pot 16, we could bet ~ half pot (8) to build pot and protect. Minimum raise is 8 (to total 8). We can raise to 8 (i.e., bet 8). That seems good. Opponent's stack is 175, can call.\n\nWe should consider tournament stage: we have 36 BB, comfortable.

Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 10 into pot 26 (so pot now 36). We have 293 chips, big stack. Should we fold? Probably yes.

In hand 44 he checked flop then bet turn. So not clear. But board is Q A J, which is high cards. Opponent could have Ace, Queen, Jack, maybe a straight draw like K T, or a pair. Our hand is terrible.

We might want to preserve chips; KTs is not strong enough to risk big.\n\nProbably call is reasonable, seeing a flop cheap, can see if we hit.\n\nBut also could 3-bet to isolate and get heads-up with a strong hand. However risk of being 4-bet all-in if opponent is aggressive.\n\nGiven limited info, I think call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nI'll call.\n\n",

Wait we have T, so 8-9-10-J-Q would be a straight using our T and board 9,J, plus need 8 and Q. That's two cards needed, not a draw. Another possibility: 10-J-Q-K-A? That's a straight using T,J, K, plus need Q and A. Also two cards. So we have no immediate straight draw, just a gutshot? Let's enumerate possibilities for a straight with our cards: We have K and T.\n\nPotential straights:\n- 9-10-J-Q-K: we have 10,J,K need Q. That's a gutshot (need Q). So we need Q on turn or river to make straight.\n- 10-J-Q-K-A: need Q and A (two cards) not possible now.\n- 7-8-9-10-J: we have 10,J,9,7 need 8. That's a gutshot needing 8.\nThus we have two gutshots: need Q or 8. Actually both are possible: 8 would give us 7-8-9-10-J straight; Q would give 9-10-J-Q-K straight. So two outs each? Actually 4 Qs and 4 8s = 8 outs (but some may be blocked by opponent's cards). So we have 8 outs.\n\nWe have a gutshot draw (8 outs) and also a backdoor flush? Suits: our hearts: Kh, Ts (spade). Board: 9c,7s,Js (spade). We have one spade (Ts). So we have two spades after flop? Actually board has Js (spade) and 7s (spade). So there are already two spades on board. We have Ts spade, so we have three spades. Need one more spade for flush draw (4 spades). So we have a backdoor flush draw (needs two more spades). Not immediate.\n\nOur hand currently is just high card King (with Ten). Board shows Jack high. So we are currently behind any Jack, any pair on board, etc. Opponent seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) bet 20 into pot 60 (so pot now 80 after call). Pot odds: need to call 20 to win 80+20? Actually current pot is 60, opponent bet 20, so total pot after call would be 80 (60+20). Call 20 to win 80, odds 2.5:1, about 28.6% needed. Our outs 8, plus maybe some combos. Approx chance to hit on turn or river? With two cards to come, chance of hitting one of 8 outs by river: probability = 1 - ( (45-8)/45 * (44-8)/44 ) = 1 - (37/45 * 36/44) = 1 - (0.8222 * 0.8182) = 1 - 0.672 = 0.328 approx 32.8%. That's above 28.6%, so calling is +EV. However we need to consider opponent's range and potential that they have made a hand already (pair, two pair, etc). Also we have only 277 chips, 34.6 BB, not huge but decent. Opponent's stack is 187 chips (22.9 BB). So they are also short. Their bet 20 is about 10% of their stack. They could be betting as a continuation with overpair (like AQ, KQ, etc). Our hand is weak.\n\nWe could also consider raising. Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise to 40 total). That would be 20 more than call. Raise sizing? If we raise to 40, we would be putting 40 total, i.e., an additional 20 beyond call. That would be a 2x bet. Might be a semi-bluff, leveraging our draw. Does opponent likely call? Might fold weaker hands. Could we get value"

Actually we have 9-10-J, missing 8 or Q for straight. With K T, we have a gutshot to 8 (8-9-10-J) or Q (9-10-J-Q). So two outs each? Actually 8 gives straight 8-9-10-J, need 8. Q gives 9-10-J-Q. So 8 and Q each 4 outs = 8 outs. Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Board has two spades (7s,4s). Our hand has no spade, so no flush draw.\n\nWe have top pair? No, we have King high, board has J as top pair for opponent maybe. We have K kicker but no pair. So currently we are behind most hands except maybe Ace-high, or maybe opponent has J (pair) etc. The opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 20 on flop, we called. Now on turn, board added 4s. Opponent's action? It's our turn now, we have amount to call 0 (meaning opponent hasn't bet yet on turn). The legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 20 (so raise must be at least 20 total). The pot is 80 (includes flop bet 20 each? Let's compute: Preflop: pot 4+8+16+12? Actually preflop: SB 4, BB 8, raise to 16, call 12 (so total preflop pot: 4+8+16+12 = 40). Flop: opponent bet 20, we called 20, pot adds 40, now pot 80. Turn: no bet yet. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need to decide: With K T, we have gutshot draws (8 outs) and some equity. Opponent's range: they raised preflop from UTG? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, they raised to 16 from UTG? Position unknown but likely early. They could have a wide range: any pair, broadways, suited connectors, etc. Flop board 9c 7s Js. They bet 20, we called. That bet size is small relative to pot (20 into 40). Could be continuation bet with many hands: any J, any 9, any 7, overpairs, combos, etc. They might have Jx, 9x, 7x, A? They might also have draws.\n\nNow turn is 4s. This changes board: adds a spade, but we have no spade. Could give flush draws to opponent if they have two spades. Could also complete some straight draws: 8 would give straight 8-9-10-J, but 4 doesn't help. So our outs remain 8.\n\nPot odds: If we raise, we need to consider if we can get value from worse hands (like Jx, 9x, etc). We have no pair, so likely we are behind many hands. Better to check and see if opponent bets later. Could also consider a semi-bluff raise to represent a strong hand (J, 9, etc). But we have only gutshot; raising could be risky because we may get called by stronger.\n\nGiven stack 257, pot 80, we could check and fold to raise later. Probably best to check.\n\nThus action: check."

          "reasoning_content": "We have turn, pot 80, board 9c 7s Js 4s. Our hand: Kh Ts. So we have a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: board: 9,7,J,4. Our hand K T gives us open-ended straight? Actually we have 9-10-J, missing 8 or Q for straight. With K T, we have a gutshot to 8 (8-9-10-J) or Q (9-10-J-Q). So two outs each? Actually 8 gives straight 8-9-10-J, need 8. Q gives 9-10-J-Q. So 8 and Q each 4 outs = 8 outs. Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Board has two spades (7s,4s). Our hand has no spade, so no flush draw.\n\nWe have top pair? No, we have King high, board has J as top pair for opponent maybe. We have K kicker but no pair. So currently we are behind most hands except maybe Ace-high, or maybe opponent has J (pair) etc. The opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 20 on flop, we called. Now on turn, board added 4s. Opponent's action? It's our turn now, we have amount to call 0 (meaning opponent hasn't bet yet on turn). The legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 20 (so raise must be at least 20 total). The pot is 80 (includes flop bet 20 each? Let's compute: Preflop: pot 4+8+16+12? Actually preflop: SB 4, BB 8, raise to 16, call 12 (so total preflop pot: 4+8+16+12 = 40). Flop: opponent bet 20, we called 20, pot adds 40, now pot 80. Turn: no bet yet. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need to decide: With K T, we have gutshot draws (8 outs) and some equity. Opponent's range: they raised preflop from UTG? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, they raised to 16 from UTG? Position unknown but likely early. They could have a wide range: any pair, broadways, suited connectors, etc. Flop board 9c 7s Js. They bet 20, we called. That bet size is small relative to pot (20 into 40). Could be continuation bet with many hands: any J, any 9, any 7, overpairs, combos, etc. They might have Jx, 9x, 7x, A? They might also have draws.\n\nNow turn is 4s. This changes board: adds a spade, but we have no spade. Could give flush draws to opponent if they have two spades. Could also complete some straight draws: 8 would give straight 8-9-10-J, but 4 doesn't help. So our outs remain 8.\n\nPot odds: If we raise, we need to consider if we can get value from worse hands (like Jx, 9x, etc). We have no pair, so likely we are behind many hands. Better to check and see if opponent bets later. Could also consider a semi-bluff raise to represent a strong hand (J, 9, etc). But we have only gutshot; raising could be risky because we may get called by stronger.\n\nGiven stack 257, pot 80, we could check and fold to raise later. Probably best to check.\n\nThus action: check.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on river. Situation: We are BB with K\u2665 T\u2660. Board: 9c 7s J s 4s 2c. So board: 9\u2663 7\u2660 J\u2660 4\u2660 2\u2663. Our hand: K\u2665 T\u2660. We have straight draw? Let's evaluate: Board has J, 9, 7, 4, 2. Our hand K T gives us gutshot? Actually we have K T, board has J, 9, 8? No 8 missing. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q? Not there. Our hand could make a straight with Q? If we had Q, we would have 9-10-J-Q-K? Actually we have K T, need Q and 9? We have 9 on board, T in hand, J board, K hand, that would be 9-10-J-Q-K missing Q. So not a straight. Also could have 8-9-10-J? Need 8 and we have K,T. Not.\n\nWe have K high, T kicker. No pair on board (no pair). Board is rainbow except three spades? Actually spades: 7\u2660, J\u2660, 4\u2660. So three spades on board. We have T\u2660, giving us a flush draw? We have one spade in hand (T\u2660). Board has three spades, need 5 spades for flush, need two more spades; we only have one, so no flush.\n\nWe have pair? No. So we have just king high, which is weak.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) actions: preflop raise to 16, we called. Flop: they bet 20, we called. Turn: they checked, we checked. River: amount to call 0, they have option to raise (minimum raise 20). So they have checked on turn, now on river we have check, they could bet/raise. We have legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call 0, check is allowed.\n\nWe need to decide whether to check or raise (or possibly fold, but we can't fold when checking? Actually we can fold if we think they'd bet, but currently it's our turn and amount to call is 0, so we can check. If we raise, we bet into them.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, MiniMax-M2's actions: they have raised preflop occasionally (hand 39 raise 38, hand 47 raise 40). They also called preflop with small amounts. On flop, they bet 20 (this hand) and previously bet 8 (hand 44) and 10 (hand 48). On turn, they checked (this hand) and previously bet 8 (hand 44) and maybe other actions.\n\nThus they may be capable of continuation bet on flop, then check turn if missed. River we have to decide.\n\nOur hand is weak; we likely should check and possibly fold to a bet later. But we have the option to raise as bluff. Evaluate stack: we have 257 chips, pot 80. Minimum raise is 20 (to 20?). Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 20 would be a bet of 20. That would be 20 into 80 pot, pot becomes 100. That's about 20% pot. Might be a small bluff.\n\nOpponent's tendencies: they have checked turn, maybe they have missed. Could they be weak? They could have a hand like Jx, 9x, etc. Board is 9-7-J-4-2. They could have J? They might have J? They raised preflop, so they likely have a strong hand preflop. Could be broadway combos like AQ, AK, KQ, etc. After flop J appears, they bet 20 (small). Could be they have J high, maybe a pair of J. Turn check suggests maybe they missed or have marginal.\n\nWe have K T, which doesn't improve. So likely we are behind. Best is to check and be prepared to fold if they bet.\n\nBut could we attempt a steal? Since they checked turn, maybe they are weak. Our raise of 20 might be a small value bet to take pot. But with king high, we risk being called and losing more chips. Our stack is decent (32 BB). Losing 20 chips is okay if we think we can win later.\n\nBetter to check and see if they bet; if they bet we can fold.\n\nThus choose \"check\". Reasoning: weak hand, board not connecting, opponent likely ahead, better to check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on river: opponent (MiniMax-M2) bets 30 into pot 110 (so pot becomes 140). Our hand: Kh Ts. Board: 9c 7s Js 4s 2c. So we have King high, plus gutshot? Actually we have straight draw? Board: 9-J-7-4-2. Our hand: K T. We have Ten, King. That gives us a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: 9-10-J would be a straight (9-10-J-Q-K?). Actually a straight needs five consecutive cards. With board 9-7-J-4-2, we have 9,7,J,4,2. Ten would give us 9-10-J, but need also Q and K? No, need five cards. Ten with board gives 9-10-J (three consecutive). Not a straight. King is high, no pair. So we have just King high. Opponent could have many hands: maybe a pair, two pair, straight draws, flush draws? Board has two spades (7s,4s). No flush possible because we have no spade. Opponent could have a straight: 8-6? 6-8 would make 6-7-8-9-10? Actually board has 9 and 7, so 8-6 gives 6-7-8-9-? Need 10? Not present. 8-6 gives 6-7-8-9, missing 5 or 10. Not a straight. 8-5 gives 5-6-7-8-9? No 6. So possible straight combos: 8-10? That would be 7-8-9-10-J? Board has 7,9,J, we have 10? Actually opponent could have 8-10 making straight 7-8-9-10-J (but board lacks 10). So not possible. 10-8 would need 10 on board, not there. 8-6? Not. So only possible straight on board is if opponent holds 8-6? That would give 6-7-8-9-? Need 10? Not. So no straight possible except maybe using Ace? Ace high? Not. So likely opponent has a pair or two pair, maybe a set? Board has no pair, but could have a pair like 9x9, 7x7, JxJ. Could have a pair of Jacks: Jx? Actually board has J, so a pocket J gives trips. Also could have a pair of 9s or 7s. Could have a straight draw missed, but they bet. Could also have a flush draw? Board spades: 7s,4s. Only two spades, need three spades in hand to have a flush, not possible. So flush not. So opponent likely has a made hand (pair or two pair) or a bluff.\n\nOur stack 257, we have 30 to call, pot 110 + 30 = 140 after call (if call). So pot odds: need to call 30 to win 140 => 21.4% equity needed. We have almost zero chance vs made hand. So folding is likely correct.\n\nBut we need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, MiniMax-M2 sometimes raises preflop, sometimes bets small on flop/turn. In recent hands: hand 44 turn bet 8 (small) after checking flop. Hand 48 flop bet 10 after calling preflop. So they are somewhat aggressive but also can bet small. In this hand, they bet 30 on river after checking turn. That's a larger bet (about 27% of pot). Could be a value bet with a pair or two pair. Our hand is weak. So fold.\n\nWe must output JSON with action \"fold\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Seat2 (Kimi-K2) larger stack, folds often, occasional raise to 24. Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) folds preflop always in data (maybe tight). Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) sometimes raises (40, 16) and calls; seems more aggressive.\n\nOur UTG open: T\u2663J\u2663 is a decent hand but not great to open UTG in a 8-handed tournament. However stack 32 BB, we can open for 2.5 BB (20) or 3 BB (24). The minimum raise is 16; raising to 20-24 is okay.\n\nGiven opponents: Seat1 likely folds unless short stack maybe raise; Seat2 may call or raise; Seat3 folds; Seat4 may raise if we raise.\n\nIf we just call 8 (i.e., limp) that's generally suboptimal UTG; we could limp and hope to see cheap flop but will be out of position and vulnerable to raises.\n\nBetter to raise to 20-24 to thin field and get value from suited connectors, also protect against 3-bets? But we could be 3-bet by MiniMax-M2 (who raised 40 previously). With 32 BB, 40 raise would be > our stack; but that's previous hand.\n\nOur raise size: typical 2.5-3 BB = 20-24. Let's choose raise to 24 (3 BB). This is within legal (minimum 16). It puts pressure on short stacks and maybe gets call from deeper players with decent hands.\n\nConsider pot odds: If we raise to 24, pot becomes 12+8+24 = 44? Actually initial pot 12 (blinds). We call 8? Wait we raise to 24, we put 24 total (including call of 8). So we add 16 more. New pot = 12 + 24 = 36? Actually before our action, we have posted small blind? No, we are UTG seat5, not blind. So pot is 12 (SB+BB). We raise to 24, meaning we put 24 chips. So total pot = 12 + 24 = 36. Opponents will need to call 24.\n\nGiven our hand, it's okay.\n\nThus action: raise to 24.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Minimum raise to 190 (so raise would be to 190 total). Opponent stack is 4 chips? Wait seat3 has 4 chips? Actually seat3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 4 chips. That's their stack size? It says 4 chips, so they are extremely short-stacked (4 chips). But they posted SB 4, so they are at 4 chips total? That seems they are on the brink, maybe they are effectively all-in? The raise to 107 is larger than their stack, but they can only raise up to their stack (4 chips). Something inconsistent: maybe they have 4 chips left after posting SB, but they raised to 107 meaning they are going all-in for 107? Actually if they have 4 chips, they cannot raise to 107. So maybe the data: seat3 has 4 chips (they are short). They posted SB 4, then they raise to 107, meaning they are effectively all-in for 107, which is more than they have, but maybe they are allowed to bet all-in for remaining chips (4). But raise amount 107 seems unrealistic. Could be a misprint: maybe seat3 has 311 chips? No seat2 has 311. seat3 is 4 chips, maybe they are the \"DeepSeek-V3.2\" with 4 chips, they are short. The raise to 107 is a big raise, maybe they have 107 chips after posting SB? Actually they posted 4, so remaining 0? This is confusing.\n\nNevertheless, we need to decide action: call 83 to 107, raise to 190 (minimum raise), or fold.\n\nOur hand: Tc Jc, suited connector, decent but not premium. Against a short stack 3-bet, they might be shoving all-in with a wide range. Our stack 233, we can call 83 to see flop, but risk losing 83 chips if we lose. In tournament, we have 29 BB, not short, but we want to preserve chips. However, if opponent is short-stacked and likely all-in, we can call with decent equity. TcJc vs unknown short stack range: likely they have strong hands (AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe some suited connectors). Our equity maybe around 30-35% vs that range. Pot odds: pot currently 139, opponent adds 107 making pot 246? Actually pot after raise: initial pot 139 (includes blinds and our raise). Then opponent raises to 107 (adds 83). So pot is 139 + 83 = 222? Wait preflop pot: blinds 4+8=12, our raise to 24 adds 16 extra (so total pot 12+24? Actually we put 24, they put 4+8? Let's compute: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, we raise to 24 (so we put 24 total, meaning we added 16). So pot after our raise = 4+8+24 = 36. Then seat1,2 fold. Then seat3 raises to 107 (adds 83 more). So pot = 36 + 83 = 119. Actually also includes their original 4? Already counted. So pot now 119. We need to call 83 to win 119. Pot odds: need to call 83 to win 119, so odds = 83/(119+83) = 83/202 \u2248 41%. So need >41% equity to be profitable. Our equity vs their range maybe 30-35%, not enough. So fold is correct.\n\nBut if they are short stack and likely all-in, we may consider calling if we have decent equity and can win chips. However pot odds 41% is high. Our hand is not strong enough. So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: recall shows they often fold preflop, occasionally raise small amounts (12, 32). Not much info. But they are short stack, may be desperate.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\n",

Actually preflop: seat3 posted SB 4, seat4 posted BB 8, seat5 raise 24 (our raise). Then seat3 raise 107 (so a 3-bet). Now we face 83 to call, min raise to 190. Stack 233. Our hand is suited JTs. In BB position, we raised first, then got 3-bet. With 29 BB stack, we could consider 4-bet all-in? Stack 233, min raise 190, all-in is 233. JcTc suited is decent for 4-bet vs 3-bet from unknown opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2). But they have 4 chips? Actually seat3 has 4 chips (they are short stack). Wait seat3 stack is 4 chips, so they are effectively all-in for 4? But they raised to 107, but they only have 4 chips? That seems contradictory: seat3 has 4 chips total, cannot raise to 107. Maybe the data: seat3 is 4 chips total, but they posted SB 4, so they are short-stacked and went all-in for 4? The raise to 107 may be a mistake. However we must treat as given: seat3 raise 107, meaning they have enough chips. But their stack is 4? That's impossible. Probably seat3 is short stack and is all-in for 4, but the raise amount shown is 107 (maybe total pot after raise?). Might be a bug. Let's assume seat3 is short stack and is all-in for 4 chips. But amount to call is 83, min raise 190. If they are all-in for 4, we could just call 4? But amount to call is 83, which is larger. Something off.\n\nGiven situation, we have 29 BB, opponent is deep (311 chips). Actually seat2 has 311 chips but folded. So seat3 has 4 chips but they raised to 107? Maybe seat3 is 4 chips after posting SB, they are short and cannot raise. So maybe seat3 is actually DeepSeek-V3.2 with 311 chips? No seat2 is Kimi-K2 with 311 chips. So seat3 has 4 chips; they cannot raise. So maybe it's a misprint. We should treat as a legitimate 3-bet to 107. Our hand JcTc is a good 4-bet candidate vs 3-bet from unknown opponent, especially with 29 BB. The raise to 190 would be 190 total, leaving us 233-190=43 chips left, not all-in. Could also go all-in 233. Considering tournament, we have medium stack, could 4-bet all-in to apply pressure, but JcTc is not premium, but it's a good hand for 4-bet vs 3-bet, especially against unknown opponent. However 4-bet all-in could be risky vs a strong range. Might be better to call and see flop? But calling 83 puts us with 150 chips left, still decent. But we are out of position after call (still BB). The opponent's 3-bet range likely includes strong combos, but also some bluffs. JcTc has ~35% equity vs typical 3-bet range. The pot after call would be 139+24+107+83 = 353? Actually pot currently 139, we raised 24, opponent 107, now call 83 makes pot ~139+24+107+83 = 353. Our equity 35% gives expected value = 0.35*353 = 124 > 83 call, so positive. So call is okay. Raising to 190 (4-bet) would be aggressive, but we might be risking all-in.\n\nGiven tournament, medium stack, I'd call to see flop and keep options.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nReturn JSON.",

So remaining stack = 150-107 = 43 chips.

Wait we have T and J, board has 7,8,Q. Straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K? Actually we need 9 and 10 to make straight 7-8-9-10-J or 8-9-10-J-Q. We have T,J, so we need 9 and K? Let's examine: With T,J we can make straight with 9-10-J-Q-K? No we need 9 and K? Actually the board is 7,8,Q. To have straight we need 9-10-J? Let's list combos: 7-8-9-10-J (we have T,J, need 9). That's one straight: 7-8-9-10-J uses our J and T, board 7,8, need 9. The other: 8-9-10-J-Q uses our T,J, board 8,Q, need 9. So we need a 9 to complete straight (any suit). Also we have a gutshot? Actually we need 9 only. So we have a single-card draw (open-ended? Actually both ends are 9? Both combos require 9, so it's a gutshot? Wait open-ended means two cards complete, but only 9 works, so it's a single card draw (one-rank). So we have a one-out? Actually there are four 9s, but some may be dead (we don't know). So about 4 outs.\n\nWe also have a flush draw? We have clubs: Tc and Jc, board has 8c, so we have a flush draw (clubs). Actually board: 7h Qd 8c. So we have two clubs in hand, one club on board, need two more clubs to make flush. That's a 9-out flush draw (since 13 clubs total, we have 2, board 1, leaving 10 clubs left, but two needed, probability of hitting on turn or river).

The rule: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So we could go all-in with 43, which is less than min raise, but it's allowed as an all-in raise. So legal actions: fold, check, raise (but raise would be all-in). But we have to consider opponent's tendencies: He checked on flop after 3-betting preflop and we called. He may be weak or trap. With our draw, we could bet (go all-in) to put pressure. Our stack is 43, pot 222, so an all-in bet would be about 19% of pot, not huge. Might be good to shove to try to win pot now or later.\n\nBut opponent's stack: He had 4 chips? Wait seat3 had 4"

So legal actions: fold, check, raise (but raise would be all-in). But we have to consider opponent's tendencies: He checked on flop after 3-betting preflop and we called. He may be weak or trap. With our draw, we could bet (go all-in) to put pressure. Our stack is 43, pot 222, so an all-in bet would be about 19% of pot, not huge. Might be good to shove to try to win pot now or later.\n\nBut opponent's stack: He had 4 chips? Wait seat3 had 4",

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 20 (so they are in the pot). So we are out of position post-flop (BB). Our stack is 138, so 16 call is ~0.12 BB (since 138 chips total, BB is 8, so 16 is 2 BB). Actually we have 138 chips total, after posting 8 BB we have 130 left. Call 16 reduces to 114 left.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies. DeepSeek-V3.2 raise amounts: previous raises: 12 (small raise), 12, 32, 12, 107 (big). So they sometimes raise big (107) maybe when strong, but also raise small 12 (1.5 BB). This raise is 24 (3 BB). So moderate size.\n\nOur hand 7c Tc is weak, not suited, no straight potential much. In early position? We are BB, but the raiser is seat 3 (UTG? Actually seat numbers: seat 1,2 folded, seat3 is DeepSeek, seat4 is MiniMax, seat5 is us. So we are in BB after seat4 called. So we are out of position.\n\nGiven stack size 138 (~17 BB), calling 2 BB is cheap, but playing weak hand out of position is risky. However we could consider a raise (to 40) which would be 40 total (i.e., raise to 40). That would be a 32 raise over call? Actually min raise to 40 means total bet = 40, we need to put 40 chips total (so additional 32). That would be 5 BB raise (since 40/8=5). That may be too aggressive with 7c Tc.\n\nBetter to fold, preserving stack. But maybe we could call and see flop cheap, maybe potential to hit straight draws (8-9-10-J). 7c Tc gives us gutshot (8-9) and open-ended if flop contains 8-9. Actually 7c Tc can make straight with 8-9-10-J or 5-6-7-8-9? With 7 and 10, you need 8-9 for straight, also 5-6-8-9 for 7-10? Actually combos: 7-10 can make straight with 8-9-X (any order) or 5-6-8-9? Let's think: 7-10: possible straights: 6-7-8-9-10 (needs 6,8,9), 7-8-9-10-J (needs 8,9,J). So you need two specific cards (8 and 9) plus maybe extra. So low chance.\n\nThus folding is likely optimal.\n\nCheck opponent: MiniMax-M2 called.

In SB, we have 6T offsuit. Stack 134 (16.8 BB). Facing 12 call to 16 total (call 12). Minimum raise to 24 (i.e., raise another 8). So we can fold, call, raise.\n\nHand 6T offsuit is marginal. In SB vs. a raise from MP (seat 4 maybe MP/CO). Position: SB is out of position post-flop. Opponent's raise size small, perhaps they are wide. Our stack moderate. Considering tournament stage? Not given chip stacks of others: Kimi-K2 45, MiniMax-M2 359, etc. Our stack 134, relative to others: we are shortish (mid). Might want to preserve chips. 6T is not strong enough to call a raise from a player who might have a decent range. Could consider folding. Could also consider 3-bet bluff? 6T is not a good bluff as it's not a premium. Raising to 24 (3BB) maybe could be seen as a 3-bet but risk. Opponent may call or re-raise. Better to fold.\n\nThus action fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have As Qh on button, stack 134, blinds 4/8. Effective stacks: 134 vs 8 BB? Actually 16.8 BB. Opponents: Seat1 SB 4 chips (short), Seat2 BB 303 chips (big). SB is very short (4 chips) cannot act? SB posted 4, but SB has only 4 chips total? Actually they posted SB, so they are all-in? They have 4 chips, which is the SB, so they are effectively all-in for 4. But they are already all-in, they cannot act further. So preflop: SB is all-in 4, BB is 8. So we have to consider that. The pot currently 12 (SB 4 + BB 8). We are on button, we can call 8 to see flop, or raise. Since SB is all-in, if we raise, we isolate BB and SB? Actually SB already all-in, can't call our raise. So raising would be a 3-way pot with BB and us. The SB is already all-in for 4, so if we call 8, pot will be 20 (4+8+8). If we raise to min 16, we put 16 total, meaning we add 8 more than call, raising total to 16, so we add 8 extra. That would be 4 (SB) + 8 (BB) + 16 (us) = 28 pot. The BB would have to call 8 more to match 16. So raising isolates BB, possibly get heads-up with BB if they call. Consider our hand: As Qh suited? Actually As Qh is Ace of spades and Queen of hearts, off-suit (different suits). Hand strength: AQs is strong, top 5% maybe. In tournament with 16.8 BB, we want to accumulate chips but also preserve stack. SB is very short; they are all-in for 4, we could call and maybe win 4 chips, but not significant. Raising could get value from BB if they call. BB stack is large 303, they likely call with wide range? But they are in BB, they might defend with many hands. Since we are on button, we can raise to isolate BB and get value. Also we could just call to see flop, but raising is standard.\n\nConsider pot odds: If we call 8 to win 4 from SB plus BB's 8 (they already posted) gives us 20 pot after call? Actually after call, we have contributed 8, total pot = 4+8+8=20. Our call costs 8 to win 12 (SB 4 + BB 8) net 12? Actually we are already in pot with SB 4 and BB 8, we call 8, we could win 12 (SB+BB) plus our 8? Wait we invest 8, pot 20 includes our 8, so net profit if we win is 12 (pot minus our contribution). So pot odds = 12/8 = 1.5:1, we need >40% equity to be correct. AQs vs SB's unknown range (they are all-in for 4, likely some random). Could be okay. But raising gives us more potential.\n\nGiven we have strong hand, raising is good. Minimum raise to 16 is okay. Stack is 134, raising 16 leaves 118. Good.\n\nThus action: raise to 16.\n\nWe need to ensure legal actions include raise. Yes.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

So call would leave us with 146 - 106 = 40 chips left (including blind? Wait we put 106 more, total in pot 8+106=114). So stack after call = 146 - 106 = 40 chips left.

Stack shallow; calling will leave us with 40 chips, still enough to continue but will be short stack. Could consider folding to preserve chips. But maybe we can call as a speculative play?

With such a weak hand, folding is standard. Consider any reason to limp? In BB you can check? Actually amount to call is 4 (small blind) because small blind posted 4, big blind posted 8, so as BB you can either call 4 (i.e., complete to 8) or raise. Usually you would just check (i.e., just post the blind) but here amount to call is 4, meaning you can just call the small blind to complete your big blind? Actually in BB, you have already posted 8, the small blind posted 4, you can either raise or check (i.e., do nothing). But the system says amount to call: 4, meaning you need to call the small blind to match the bet? But you already have 8 in, the small blind is 4, so you are effectively 4 over the small blind. Usually you can just check (i.e., not put more chips). But the interface may treat \"call\" as completing the bet to 8? Actually amount to call is 4, meaning you need to put 4 more to bring total to 8? But you already have 8 posted as BB, but maybe they treat call as \"call the small blind's 4\"? That seems odd. But typical logic: In BB, after SB posts 4, BB posted 8, the action is on BB, they can either raise or check (i.e., do nothing). So amount to call should be 0. But they show amount to call 4. Might be that the small blind is considered a bet of 4, and BB must call 4 to match? But they'd have to add 4 to make total 12? Actually pot is 12 (4+8). So BB's current contribution is 8, SB 4. If BB wants to \"call\", they'd need to match the SB's bet of 4? That would make BB total 12? That seems off. However, many poker bots treat BB as having posted 8, so amount to call is 0. But here they show amount to call: 4, maybe they consider that BB can either call the small blind (i.e., put 4 more to bring to 12) or raise to 16 total. That would be a \"limp\" call? Usually you wouldn't add more. So maybe the system expects \"call\" to be the action of just checking (i.e., no extra chips). But they set amount to call 4, maybe because the small blind is considered a bet and BB must call to continue. In that case, calling would be adding 4, making total 12 chips contributed (BB now 12). That seems weird but okay.\n\nGiven the hand is 2-7 offsuit, worst hand. Should fold. Even if we could check for free, but the system may require a call of 4 to stay in. But folding is safe.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning: worst hand, short stack relative to blinds, not worth risking chips.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Actually seat3 is out but raise 212). That raise is 212 total? Usually raise amount includes call? The raise of 212 likely means they put 212 chips total (i.e., they raised to 212). Since BB posted 16, they need to call 212-16 = 196 to match. The pot after raise: 8+16+212 = 236 (makes sense). So we have to call 196 to stay, but our stack is 102 chips total, we cannot call 196. Actually our stack is 102 chips, but we already posted 16 blind, leaving 86 remaining. So we cannot call full amount; we can go all-in for remaining 86. However legal actions only list fold, call. The system maybe doesn't allow raise because min raise is 408 which we cannot meet. But we could go all-in as a call? In poker, you can call all-in for less than amount to call; it's considered a call (or a call for less). So we can \"call\" which will be all-in for remaining 86. The action \"call\" will be accepted and we will be all-in.\n\nWe need to decide: hand Kd4h is weak, not a good candidate to call an all-in, especially short stack. Our stack is short relative to raise; we are effectively forced all-in for 86. The opponent raised to 212 from 239 chips stack (they have 239). They likely have a strong hand.

Opponent in Seat2 is the only other player left (they posted BB? Wait they are seat2, they posted BB? Actually seat2 posted BB 16, meaning they are big blind? Wait we are BB seat5, but seat2 posted BB 16. Something off: The description says your position: BB (Seat5). But actions show seat5 post_sb 8 (small blind), seat2 post_bb 16 (big blind). So you are actually SB? It says you posted small blind 8. So you are SB seat5. But they say Position: BB (Seat5). Might be mislabel. Let's interpret: You posted SB 8, so you are SB. The big blind is seat2 with 16 chips. So you are SB with 94 chips, 5.9 BB effective (since small blind 8). After blinds, pot 24. Action to you: amount to call 8 (to complete BB? Actually to call big blind 16? Wait you already posted 8, you need to call 8 more to match BB). So you can call 8, raise min to 32 (total). You have K\u2660 Q\u2665, a decent hand but not premium. In early stage tournament, stack 5.9 BB is short stack. You are short stack; you need to pick spots to go all-in or fold. KQ offsuit in SB vs BB with 236 chips? Actually BB has 236 chips. You have 94 chips. If you call 8, you will have 86 left. You can also raise to 32 (total). Minimum raise to 32 means you put total 32 chips (including your 8 already posted). So you would add 24 more. That would be a raise of 16 over call? Actually call is 8, raise to 32 is +24. That would be 32 total in pot from you (including 8). That would be 16 raise over big blind? Not sure.\n\nGiven short stack, typical play is to shove all-in if you have decent equity. KQ offsuit is decent but not great vs unknown. You could consider stealing blind: you could raise to 32 (which is 2x BB). But with 5.9 BB, raising may be okay. However, many players might call with wide range. Might be better to go all-in (94) to maximize fold equity? But you only have 94 chips, which is less than 6 BB, all-in would be 94 total (including 8 posted). That is about 5.9 BB, which is a decent shove. KQ suited? It's offsuit. In short stack, KQo is okay but not best. However, typical push/fold chart: With 5-6 BB, KQo is a push from SB? Usually push from SB with 5-6 BB if you have at least QJ, KQ maybe? I think KQ is pushable.\n\nThus best action: raise all-in (call amount to 94). But legal actions only allow raise to min 32. But you can raise to any amount up to your stack. So you could raise to 94 (all-in). So action: raise, raise_to 94.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually blinds are 8/16, so BB is 16, but stack 8 chips? That's less than BB, maybe short stack. Preflop: seat5 posted small blind 8, seat2 posted big blind 16. Then seat5 raised to 94 (so added 86 more). Seat2 called 78 (so total 94). So pot now 188 chips (including blinds). On flop 3s 2d 4d. Board is low, rainbow (two diamonds). Our hand: K\u2660 Q\u2665, no pair, no straight draw (needs A5 for straight, or 5 for gutshot? Actually board 3-2-4, we have open-ended straight draw? 2-3-4, we need 5 or A to make straight. We have KQ, no. So just overcards. Stack after preflop: we have 8 chips left? Wait we started with maybe 200? Actually we posted 8 SB, then raised 94 (total 102). So our stack after raise is original stack minus 102. The description says Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB). That suggests we are effectively at 8 chips left after raising? That seems inconsistent: we raised to 94, but we only have 8 chips left? Perhaps the stack shown is remaining after the raise? Let's compute: blinds 8/16, we posted 8 SB, then raise to 94 (so we added 86 more). So total contributed 94. If our stack was 102 (8+94) originally, then after that we have 0 left. But they show stack 8 chips. Maybe they misinterpret: after posting SB we have 8 chips left? Actually they say \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\". That suggests we have only 8 chips total before any action, which is less than big blind. But then we raised to 94, impossible. So likely the stack is after posting SB? Wait preflop: seat5 post_sb 8 (so we posted 8 from stack). Then we raise to 94, meaning we put total 94 in pot, which includes the 8 already posted. So we need to have at least 94 chips. The stack line might be erroneous. But we must treat as we have 8 chips left after the raise? Actually after raise, we have remaining chips = original stack - 94. If original stack unknown, but after raise we have 8 chips left? That would mean original stack = 102. So after raise we have 8 chips left. That matches \"Your Stack: 8 chips\". So we are short stack with 8 chips remaining (0.5 BB). So we are effectively all-in for 8 chips? But we already committed 94. So we have 8 chips left to act further. On flop, amount to call is 0, meaning opponent hasn't bet. Minimum raise to 78, but legal actions are fold, check. So we cannot raise because we have only 8 chips left, less than min raise. So we can only check or fold. Checking is default.\n\nWe need to decide: check (no bet) or fold? Since no bet, folding would concede pot. Checking is fine. Our hand is weak, but we have no bet to call. So we check.\n\nThus action: check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Actually they have 8 chips left, but they have already contributed 94 preflop? Wait they raised 94 preflop, which likely used all chips? If they had 8 chips total, they couldn't raise to 94. So maybe the stack is after posting blinds but before raising, they had 8 chips total? That is impossible. Something off.\n\nProbably the stack is remaining after all previous bets? Actually after preflop raise 94, they would have 8-94? negative. So maybe the stack is the amount they have left after all previous actions, which is 8 chips (they are short).

The pot is 188, they have 8 chips left, they can go all-in for 8.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check. Minimum raise to 78 but they cannot raise (insufficient). So they can either check (i.e., go all-in? Actually checking means not betting, but they still have 8 chips left, but they can't raise). They could also fold, but they have already contributed all chips? Actually they have 8 chips left, but they have already contributed 94 preflop? Wait they raised 94 preflop, which likely used all chips? If they had 8 chips total, they couldn't raise to 94. So maybe the stack is after posting blinds but before raising, they had 8 chips total? That is impossible. Something off.\n\nProbably the stack is remaining after all previous bets? Actually after preflop raise 94, they would have 8-94? negative. So maybe the stack is the amount they have left after all previous actions, which is 8 chips (they are short). So they cannot bet any more. So they can only check (i.e., not bet). So they must check.\n\nBut we need to decide if we should check (i.e., not bet) or fold. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. Folding would give opponent the pot, but we are already all-in? Actually we still have chips but can't bet. Checking is fine.\n\nGiven we have top pair K, but opponent could have flush (diamonds) or straight (5). Opponent's stack is 145 chips, they have deep. They have checked both flop and turn. That could indicate they have weak hand or drawing. River is also a check? Actually we are at river with amount to call 0, opponent hasn't acted yet? The actions list ends at turn check. We need to act now (river). The opponent will act after us? The order: We are seat5, opponent seat2. Since we are BB (maybe small blind) we act first preflop, then after flop and turn they both checked. On river, the action is likely to start with the player left of the button? Not sure. But",

So it's a raise of 64 total (i.e., 48 raise over BB). We need to decide to fold, call, or raise.\n\nOur hand: 8T offsuit (8d Td). It's a decent suited? Actually unsuited (both diamonds? Wait 8d and Td both diamonds, so it's suited! Both are diamonds. So it's a suited Ten-Eight. That's a suited connector-ish, decent for deep stacks but at 12 BB, it's marginal. Position: button, we have advantage. Stack: 196 chips, 12.2 BB. Effective stack: min opponent stack? Seat2 has 137 chips (~8.5 BB), seat3 has 220 (~13.8 BB), seat4 has 322 (~20 BB). So effective stack is about 137 (seat2) but seat2 hasn't acted yet (post sb). Actually seat2 posted sb 8, still in hand. So effective stack is 137 chips. Our call would be 64 chips, leaving us with 132 chips (~8.25 BB). That's okay.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2's raise sizes: varied from small (4) to large (228). Recent raise of 64 (hand 62). That was a raise of 64 preflop (maybe from a 16 BB). So they sometimes raise big, sometimes small. Not clear. Could be a strong hand.\n\nOur hand 8dTd suited has decent equity vs random but not vs strong. At 12 BB, we might consider a 3-bet if we think we can isolate and have postflop skill, but 8T suited is not a typical 3-bet hand in short stack. Also raising to 112 (minimum raise) would be 112 total (i.e., raise to 112). That would be 48 more chips, total 112. That would be 5.5 BB. Might be too much.\n\nGiven we are short stack and our hand is marginal, calling is typical. Also we have button, we could call and try to see flop. But we must consider the SB (seat2) hasn't acted yet; after we call, seat2 will act (post sb). The SB has 137 chips, might call or raise. If they raise, we could be in tough spot.\n\nGiven the raise is 64 (4BB) and we have 12 BB, we can call and see flop. Our hand can make strong draws (flush, straight). So call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

Actually we have 8-10, board 7-9, we have 8-9-10, missing 6 for 6-7-8-9-10 straight, also missing J for 7-8-9-10-J. So we have two outs for straight (6 and J). Plus we have flush draw: any diamond except 3,9,8,10? We have 8d Td, board has 3d 9d, so remaining diamonds are A,K,Q,J, etc. Total diamonds left: 13 total diamonds, we have 2, board has 2, so 9 remaining. But two of those are straight outs (Jd counts both straight and flush). So total outs about 9 (flush) + 2 (straight) - overlap (Jd) = 10 outs? Actually Jd is counted in flush outs; also Jd is a straight out. So unique outs: diamonds other than 3d,9d,8d,Td = 9. Among those, Jd is also straight, but still an out. So total outs = 9 (flush) + 1 (6) = 10? Wait 6 is not a diamond, so add 1. So total outs = 10. So about 10 outs.\n\nPot: 352. Bet 200, we need to call 200. So pot odds: call 200 to win 552 (pot 352 + 200 call = 552). So pot odds = 200/552 = 36.2% required. Our chance to hit on turn and river with 10 outs: approximate probability: 10 outs * 2 = 20% on turn, plus if miss turn, chance on river = (42 outs? Actually 10 outs out of 46 after turn) ~21.7% * (1-20%) = about 17%? Let's compute: probability to hit by river = 1 - ((46-10)/46)*((45-10)/45) = 1 - (36/46)*(35/45) = 1 - (0.7826)*(0.7778)=1 - 0.608 = 0.392. So about 39% chance to hit by river. That's above 36% required, so call is +EV.\n\nBut also consider opponent: MiniMax-M2 raised preflop to 64, we called, now bets 200 on flop. He likely has a hand like overpairs (TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA) maybe a set (33,99,77) or a flush draw, or a straight draw, or a made hand like 9d8d? Actually board 3d 9d 7h. He may have 9x, 8x, a flush draw, etc. He bet 200 into pot 352, about 57% pot. He could be semi-bluffing with draws, or value betting with strong hand. Our draw is decent.\n\nStack: we have 132 chips, we are short stack (8.2 BB). Our remaining stack after calling 200? Wait we have 132 chips total, but we already put 64 preflop, so current effective stack is 132-64 = 68 chips left. But the pot shows 352, includes our 64? Let's compute: preflop: MiniMax raised 64, we called 64. So pot after preflop = 64 (raise) + 64 (call) + small blind 8 + big blind 16 = 152? Actually small blind posted 8, big blind 16, then raise to 64 from seat 4 (so he put 64, not 64 extra?), but raise amount includes the big blind? In typical, raise to 64 means he put 64 total, so additional 48 on top of 16. Then we call 64 (matching). So pot = SB 8 + BB 16 + MiniMax 64 + us 64 = 152. But the flop pot is 352, meaning maybe there were antes? But not needed. Anyway, we have 132 chips total,"

Actually seat3 is after seat2? Let's see order: Seat5 is BB, seat2 is SB? Wait blinds: SB is seat5 posted 8? Actually actions: Seat5 post_sb 8, Seat2 post_bb 16, Seat3 raise 68. So seat5 is SB? Confusing. The description says Position: BB (Seat5). But action shows seat5 posted sb 8, seat2 posted bb 16. So seat5 is small blind, seat2 is big blind. But they say our position BB seat5, maybe they mis-ordered. Regardless we are the small blind (or BB) with 7c6s, facing a raise of 68 from seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2). Our stack 368, pot 92 (includes blinds). Amount to call 60 (68-8? Actually we posted 8, need to call 60). Minimum raise to 120 (i.e., raise total 120). Need to decide.\n\nWe should consider opponent's raise size: 68 is 4.25 BB (big blind is 16). That's a relatively standard raise (around 4-5 BB). Opponent's range likely strong, but could include suited connectors, etc. Our hand 7-6 suited is speculative. In early position (they are seat3, maybe UTG?), we are in SB (or BB). With 23 BB stack, we could call and see flop for cheap, but we are out of position postflop. 7-6 suited can flop well, but also can be dominated.\n\nWe need to consider tournament: stack 23 BB, medium depth, we can afford a call if we think we have implied odds. But being out of position, call could be risky.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: from recall, they have raised amounts varying from 12 to 212, showing they can raise big or small. Not much info on folding. They have shown some suited connectors? Showdowns show they had 7cAc (top pair), 6s6c (pair), KsKh (premium), KcKs (premium), 9h9c (pair). So they seem to play strong hands. Not clear about speculative.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, I'd lean to fold. The raise is 68, we would need to call 60 to see flop, but out of position, likely to be dominated. Better to preserve stack.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #72 preflop. Position BTN, 7d9c, stack 368 (23 BB). Blinds 8/16. Small blind seat2 8 chips, big blind seat3 16 chips. Seat4 folded. So we face a raise? Actually actions: seat2 posted sb 8, seat3 posted bb 16, seat4 folded, now it's our turn. Amount to call 16 (big blind). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise by at least 16). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength: 7d9c is a suited connector? Actually 7d9c unsuited. Off-suit gap 2. Not strong. In BTN, can open raise or call? But there is already a big blind (seat3) who posted 16. We could call 16, which is 1 BB. That's a decent call if we think we have equity vs BB's range. However we also have a short stack (23 BB). Raising to 32 would be 2 BB total. That's a standard open raise size for BTN (2-2.5 BB). But the BB is already there; raising would be 32 total (i.e., raise to 32, which is 16 more). That is a standard raise. Should we raise? 7-9 offsuit is a marginal hand; many players raise with it in BTN? Usually you'd raise with a broader range from BTN, maybe 7-9 off-suit is borderline; some players open with any two cards in BTN. But given we have short stack, we might want to preserve chips; but also we want to accumulate.\n\nWe should also consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (seat2) is the SB, not the BB. The BB is DeepSeek-V3.2 seat3. We have data for Kimi-K2's raises preflop (various sizes). Not sure about DeepSeek's tendencies. We have no info about BB.\n\nBut we are facing only the BB's blind; they haven't acted yet. So we can raise to try to steal blinds. With 7d9c offsuit, not great but can still raise to attempt steal; risk if BB calls and has stronger range. However our stack is 23 BB, not desperate.\n\nGiven the hand is weak, maybe we should just call and see flop cheap, hoping to hit a straight draw. But calling 1 BB with a weak hand is okay but may get us into tricky postflop decisions.\n\nBetter perhaps to fold? But folding a BTN hand for 1 BB is too tight; we can at least call.\n\nI think optimal is to call 16 (i.e., limp) to see flop cheap. However many players think limping is suboptimal; raising is better to apply pressure. But with 7-9 offsuit, raising may be exploited.\n\nGiven limited info, I'd call.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

That seems impossible. Actually seat2's stack is 8 chips, they posted SB 8, so they are all-in already (post sb). Then they cannot raise. Something inconsistent. Maybe seat2's stack is 8 chips left after posting sb? Actually they posted sb 8, so they have 0 left; they cannot raise. But actions show they raised to 61, maybe they have more chips? Could be a mistake. Let's assume seat2 has more chips, maybe 120? The table shows seat2: 8 chips (folded) earlier? Actually seat2: \"Kimi-K2 - 8 chips\" maybe that's current stack after posting?

We have open-ended straight draw? Board K J 4, we have 5,4. Actually we have pair of fours, and we have a gutshot straight draw? Let's see possible straight: 6-5-4-? Not. The board: K J 4. To make a straight we need 8-9-10? No. So only potential is a flush draw and a pair of fours. Also we have backdoor straight possibilities. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) checked to us. Pot is 32. We are in BB, stack 336. Opponent is 326 chips. Both have deep stacks. We have a marginal hand, but we have a flush draw and a pair. Could consider betting to protect and build pot. But opponent just checked; we could check behind and see turn. If we bet, we risk being called or raised by better hand (Kc, Jc, etc). What is opponent likely? He called preflop with 8 from SB, so his range includes many hands: suited connectors, broadways, etc. On flop with Kc Jc 4c, his check could be weak. Betting could be good to take pot or get value from draws. Our hand is not strong enough for big bet maybe small bet 16 (half pot). Legal raise minimum 16. Could raise to 48? Actually raise to total amount. Minimum raise to 16 means you can raise to at least 32? Wait: amount to call is 0, so raise to at least 16? Usually raise must be at least double the big blind? But given min raise to 16, means raise total bet of 16? So we can bet 16. That would be half pot. That seems fine.\n\nConsider pot odds: If we bet 16, we might get called by worse draws or by hands like Kx, Jx, etc. But we risk being raised by stronger like Kc, Jc, etc. But opponent may not raise.\n\nGiven tournament stage (21 BB), we want to accumulate chips but also not risk too much. A bet of 16 is modest.\n\nThus action: raise to 48? Actually raise to total amount. Let's decide to bet 48 (3BB) maybe? But min raise 16, we can raise to 48.

Opponents: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 310 chips, likely the big stack. Seat 2 has 109 chips. Seat 4 called preflop 16 (so they are in). Seat 2 checked preflop (they are BB). So the flop action: after preflop, it's seat 2 (BB) who checked? Actually after preflop, it's seat 2's turn? The flop: we need to see who acted first. Usually after flop, the first active player to left of button? In SB, the order is UTG, etc. But only seats 2,4,5 are in. Seat 5 is SB, seat 2 is BB, seat 4 is MP?

However legal actions: we have amount to call 0, minimum raise 16, legal actions fold, check, raise. So it's our turn with amount 0 to call. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need to consider opponent's likely hand. Seat4 called preflop 16 (so they probably have a hand like suited connectors, broadways, or small pair).

So they could have Ace with a good kicker, like A9, AK, etc. That would be two pair Aces and Tens? Actually board has Ace and Ten, so if they have Ace, they'd have pair of Aces with Ten kicker (or better if they have Ten as well). Actually if they have Ace, they'd have two pair (Aces and Tens) because board already has Ace and Ten. So they'd have A? with any other card, they'd have two pair Aces and Tens (since board has Ace and Ten). That's better than our single pair Tens.\n\nAlso they could have a straight draw like 9J (open-ended) for a straight: 9J would give 9-J-T-A-? Actually 9-J gives a straight 9-10-J-Q-K? No board is 7, T, A. 9J would give 9-10-J? Not a straight yet. 9-J would give 9-10-J? Need 8-9-10-J-Q? Not there. So maybe they have 9-8 for open-ended? 8-9 would give 7-8-9-10?

Our hand: 3c? Wait we have 3s Tc. So we have pair of tens, kicker 3 (low). Could be vulnerable to A (any Ace) or other tens? There's only one ten on board (Ts). Opponent (MiniMax-M2) in seat 4 has unknown hand. They called flop bet. Pot after flop: 144 (preflop: blinds 8+16, flop bet 48 from us, call from MiniMax 48). So pot 144 includes our 48, his 48, blinds 8+16? Actually pot includes all chips: before flop pot had 8+16+16+8? Let's compute: Preflop: SB 8 (us), BB 16 (opponent), seat 4 call 16, seat5 call 8. So pot after preflop: 8+16+16+8 = 48. Then flop bet 48 from us, call 48 from seat4. So pot becomes 48 + 48 + 48 = 144. Good.\n\nNow turn card not shown. Actually board after turn: 7h Ts Ad 5c ?. Wait board: \"7h Ts Ad 5c\". That's 4 cards; turn is 5c? Actually board shows 4 cards: 7h (flop 1), Ts (flop 2), Ad (flop 3), 5c (turn). So turn is 5c (clubs). So board: 7h Ts Ad 5c.\n\nNow it's our turn? Actually actions: preflop, flop, now turn: we have amount to call 0, min raise 48, legal actions fold, check, raise. So it's our decision on turn, after opponent hasn't acted yet? Wait order: we are BB seat5, opponent seat4 is MP? Actually seat order: seat1,2,3,4,5. Preflop: seat5 post_sb (we are SB? Actually we are BB seat5, but they posted small blind 8? Wait blinds 8/16, seat5 is BB, so they posted 16 as BB. But actions show seat5 post_sb 8 - meaning they posted small blind? Something off. But we accept given.\n\nNow flop: seat5 bet 48, seat2 folded, seat4 called 48. So after flop, seat5 acted first (probably because SB? anyway). Now turn: it's seat5's action again (since seat4 hasn't acted yet). So we have option to bet (raise) or check.\n\nOur hand: Pair of tens, board has Ace high, potential straight draws? Board: 7, T, A, 5. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J? Not. Could be 6-7-8-9? Not. So no immediate draws. Opponent could have Ace (top pair Aces), could have Ten (two pair), could have 7-5 combos, etc.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: we have 304 chips, opponent 262. Pot 144. If we bet 48 (minimum raise), pot would be 192, opponent would need call 48 to continue, leaving them about 214 after call. Our stack after bet would be 256.\n\nWe need to think about opponent tendencies: recall opponent's turn bets: they bet small amounts (8, 28, 29, 32) in previous hands. Those are relatively small relative to pot? Not sure pot sizes. Likely they are modest. Could indicate they are passive or try to protect.\n\nWe also might consider that we have top pair but weak kicker; if opponent has Ace, they have top pair (Aces) with any kicker, they beat us. If opponent has Ten, they have two pair (Tens and something else) which also beats us (we have only pair). Actually we have pair of tens; opponent could have Ten with something else, giving them two pair (Tens + something). That also beats us. So our hand is vulnerable.\n\nThus maybe we should check and see if they bet later. Check to control pot size.\n\nPot odds: If we bet and they call, we risk 48 to possibly win 192. But if they have Ace or better, we lose. If they have weaker hand (e.g., 9-8, etc), we may be ahead. But we have no strong kicker; many hands beat us.\n\nThus likely checking is prudent.\n\nBut also consider tournament stage: stack 19 BB, need to accumulate chips. But preserving is important.\n\nThus decision: check"

It's our turn? Let's see: After turn, actions: Seat5 call 48, so pot now includes turn bet. Now river: It's our turn (Seat5) after opponent (MiniMax-M2) acted on turn. Actually after turn call, the next street is river, and it's our action first because we are in BB? Usually order: after turn betting round ends, the button is next, but since only two players remain (Seat4 and Seat5), the player who acted first on the previous street acts first on next street. On turn, order: Seat5 checked, Seat4 bet, Seat5 called. So after call, the betting is closed, and on river, the first to act is the player who was last to act on previous street? Actually in heads-up, the dealer acts first preflop, but after flop, the player who is left of the button acts first. In BB vs CO situation: Seat5 is BB, Seat4 is CO (cutoff). On flop, after preflop, seat5 (BB) acted first (bet 48), seat4 called. Turn: seat5 checked, seat4 bet, seat5 called. So on river, seat5 (BB) is first to act (since he was last to act on previous street? Actually after turn betting, the player who made the bet (seat4) is considered the aggressor, and the other player gets action first on river. So seat5 acts first. So we need to decide action on river with board 7h Ts Ad 5c 9c, our hand 3s Tc. So we have pair of tens (top pair) with kicker? Actually board: T, A, 9, 5, 7. We have Tc, so we have two tens (pair), plus straight draws? Let's evaluate opponent's range. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has 214 chips, stack 214, we have 256. Pot is 240 now? After turn call, pot = previous pot 240? Let's compute: Preflop: blinds 8+16 =24. Calls: seat4 16, seat5 8 => total 48? Actually preflop pot: 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 16 (call) + 8 (call) = 48. Then flop bet 48 by seat5, seat4 called 48 => pot adds 96, total pot = 144. Turn: seat5 check, seat4 bet 48, seat5 call 48 => adds 96, pot = 240. Yes pot 240 now. No river bet yet. So we are first to act, can check or bet/raise. Opponent stack 214, we have 256.\n\nOur hand: Pair of tens, top pair (tens) with Ace kicker on board. Opponent could have Ace, could have straight draws (8-6, 6-4?), board: A T 9 5 7. Straight possibilities: 8-6 gives 6-7-8-9-10 straight? Actually board has 7,9,5, T, A. 6-8 would make 6-7-8-9-10 straight (needs 8 and 6). Opponent could have 8-6 combos. Also 8-9? Already 9 on board. 6-8 combos are possible. Also 8-8? Pair of 8s not straight. Also 6-5? 5 on board. 6-5 gives 5-6-7-8-9? Need 8. Not.\n\nAlso possible flush? Board has two clubs: Ts, 5c, 9c (two clubs). Our hand has 3s, Tc (no clubs). So opponent could have club flush draw with two clubs in hand (e.g., Kc Qc). But there are only two clubs on board, need 3 clubs total for flush, so need both clubs in hand. That's possible.\n\nAlso opponent could have Ace high (A?).\n\nWe need to decide action: Check or bet. Consider opponent's tendencies: recall opponent's turn betting patterns: they bet small amounts on turn (8-32) in previous hands. In this hand they bet 48 (size of pot/5?). Actually pot 144, they bet 48 = 1/3 pot. That's moderate. Could be value bet or bluff.\n\nOur stack is 256, pot 240, we can bet for value. We have top pair, but opponent could have Ace (A with something) giving two pair (Aces and Tens). That would beat us. Also opponent could have straight (6"

If opponent has A9, they'd have two pair Aces and Nines plus top pair tens? Actually they'd have A9 making two pair Aces and Nines, and we have pair of tens. So opponent ahead.

Actually board: T, A, 9, 5, 7. We have Tc, board has Ts, so we have two pair? Wait board: Ts, Ad, 7h, 5c, 9c. We have Tc, so we have pair of tens (two tens: Ts on board and Tc). That's just a pair, not two pair. Actually we have one ten on board, plus our ten, so we have two tens = pair of tens. No other pair. So we have top pair (ten) with a decent kicker (3). Not great.\n\nOpponent (Seat 4) is MiniMax-M2, stack 166 chips. He bet 48 on turn after we checked. Turn board: after turn (the 5c?) Actually board order: Flop: 7h Ts Ad. Turn: 5c. River: 9c. So turn was a 5c, a club. He bet 48 on turn. Then river: 9c (club). He bet 48 on river.\n\nWe need to evaluate opponent's range. Preflop: He called 16 (big blind) from seat 4 (MP? Actually seat 4). So he likely had a decent hand, maybe broadways, suited connectors, etc.\n\nFlop: Board 7h Ts Ad. We bet 48 (3BB). He called. So his range includes Aces, Tens, maybe draws, maybe middle pairs, etc.\n\nTurn: board 5c. He bet 48 (about half pot). We checked. He bet again 48. Could be a continuation bet with Aces, Tens, maybe a flush draw? The turn introduced a club, giving a possible flush draw (two clubs on board: 5c, plus later 9c). He could have clubs.\n\nRiver: board 9c (third club). He bets 48 again. This is a river bet of about half pot. Could be value with Ace (A9, A5, A7, etc), Ten (T9, T5, T7), maybe a made flush (clubs). He could also be bluffing missed draws (like Jc8c, etc). Our hand: Ten pair. Could be best? Let's consider possible opponent holdings.\n\nBoard final: Ts Ad 5c 9c 7h. Actually order: 7h, Ts, Ad, 5c, 9c. So there is a possible straight? 5-7-9-T-A, no straight. Flush? three clubs (5c,9c,?? only two clubs on board? Actually we have 5c and 9c, plus maybe other clubs? The flop had no clubs, turn added 5c, river 9c, so only two clubs on board. So flush not possible for opponent unless they have two clubs in hand. That would be a nut flush? Not possible because need five clubs, only three clubs total (2 on board + 2 in hand) = flush. Actually flush needs 5 of same suit. There are only two clubs on board, so opponent would need both hole cards clubs, making a flush. That's possible.\n\nOur hand includes Tc (clubs) and 3s. So we have one club. Not a flush.\n\nPotential opponent ranges: Could have A9 (makes two pair A9), A5 (A5), A7 (A7), AT (two pair tens and aces?), Actually AT would be two pair (tens and aces) and we have top pair only, so opponent could have better two pair.\n\nCould have KQ, QJ, etc for straight draws? Not completed.\n\nCould have flush draws: clubs like KcQc, Jc8c, etc missed.\n\nCould have straight draws like 8-9? Actually 8-9 would give straight on board? 7-8-9-T? Need 8-9? board has 7, T, A, 5, 9. 8-9 would give 7-8-9-T? That's not a straight because need 6-7-8-9-10 or 8-9-T-J-Q. Not there.\n\nSo best hands: Two pair Aces+Tens (AT) or Aces+9s (A9), Aces+7s, Aces+5s, Aces+9? Actually A9 is Ace and 9 gives two pair Aces and 9s (board has 9). That beats our pair of tens.\n\nAlso could have a set? No board doesn't have pair aside from T. Could"

Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., raise 32 more). So we can call 16 to see flop, raise to 64 (total) or fold. Hand is 5c Tc, suited? Actually 5c Tc, both clubs, so suited Ten-Five. That's a weak hand, low suited connector. In BB with short stack (~7 BB), typical strategy: if you have no raise before you, you can consider limping (call) with speculative hands if implied odds, but stack is shallow, so not many implied odds. Also there are only 2 opponents left: Seat 2 (218 chips) in SB? Actually seat 2 posted SB 16, seat 5 is BB posted 32. So only SB and BB left. So we are heads-up preflop. With 7 BB, you could consider raising to steal blinds? But SB already posted 16, BB is us. The SB is a short stack? 218 chips, about 6.8 BB (since BB is 32). So both are short. In heads-up, 5cTc is not a premium hand but could be playable. Since it's BB, we could just check (call 0) but we already posted BB, we can check (i.e., just see flop) if we want. But amount to call is 16 (the SB's blind). If we just check, we would be checking to SB? Actually in BB, after SB posts, action is to act first. The amount to call is SB's blind (16). So we can call (i.e., match 16) or raise. If we check, that means we are not calling SB's blind; but we have already posted BB, but we still need to match SB's blind to continue. In poker, you cannot check when there is a bet; you must call or raise. So we must either call 16, raise to 64, or fold (fold would be weird, you'd just give up BB). So likely we call.\n\nGiven hand strength: 5cTc suited, not great but can make flush, straight. With short stack, you may want to preserve chips. Call 16 to see flop, but if flop is bad you may be forced to fold. However you could also raise to try to steal, but 5cTc is weak for a raise; SB may call or re-raise. Since SB is also short, they could shove all-in. Raising to 64 (2 BB) may be too small; they'd likely call or raise. Better to just call and see flop.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nWe need JSON with raise_to null.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

With only 6.8 BB, options: fold, call (all-in? call is 32, leaving 184 left, still > 5 BB). Could also raise all-in (minimum raise is 64, which is 2 BB raise, but we could go all-in 216? The raise_to is total amount we put in. We can raise to all-in if we want. However, 7s5s is not a good hand to steal UTG, especially with short stack; but sometimes short stack shove is okay to try to steal blinds? However UTG with 7-5 suited is not a good candidate; it's not premium enough. The effective stack is short, but we could consider a shove to try to pick up blinds if opponents are tight. But there are only two players left to act (seats 2 and 3? Actually seats 1 folded, seat 2 is Kimi-K2 with 378 chips, seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2 with 80 chips, seat 4 is MiniMax-M2 with 193 chips, seat 5 is us. The blinds posted: seat 3 posted SB 16, seat 4 posted BB 32. So we are UTG, after blinds, it's our turn to act before SB and BB. So if we shove, we need to consider that SB has 80 chips (2.5 BB) and BB 193 chips (6 BB). They may call with wide ranges, especially SB short stack may call all-ins. Our hand is weak; likely we will be called and be dominated. Better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

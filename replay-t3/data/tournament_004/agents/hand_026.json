            "reasoning_content": "  The player in seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been very tight, folding preflop in the last 6 hands. The only time they didn't fold preflop was hand #18 where they checked flop and turn, then made a small river bet. This suggests they're a very tight, possibly passive player.\n\nNow they're raising to 12 (3x the BB) from late position. Given their tight image, this raise likely represents a strong hand. \n\nMy hand is A7o (Ace of clubs, 7 of hearts). This is a marginal hand, especially with a short stack of only 18.8 BB. \n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Hand strength**: A7o is not a strong hand. It's dominated by many Ax hands that a tight player would raise with (AK, AQ, AJ, AT, A9, A8).\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN, which is good position, but that doesn't help much with a weak hand against a tight raiser.\n3. **Stack size**: At 18.8 BB, I'm in the danger zone. I need to be very selective with my hands. I cannot afford to call and then fold postflop often.\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: GPT-OSS-120B has folded 6 times in a row preflop and is now raising. This is likely a strong range.\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 12 to win 18, so getting 1.5:1 odds. This is not enough to call with A7o against a tight range.\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With a short stack, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold. Calling here would leave me with 63 chips (15.75 BB) and in a difficult postflop situation. \n\nThe best play is to fold. I could consider shoving as a re-steal, but against a tight player who just raised from late position after folding many hands, this would be risky. My A7o doesn't have good equity against their likely raising range.\n\nLet me fold and wait for a better spot.",

I need to call 8 to see a flop.\n\nMy stack: 121 chips (30.2 BB). Opponent: 375 chips (93.8 BB).\n\nLooking at opponent history: GPT-OSS-120B has folded 7 hands in a row preflop (hands 19-25). This is their first raise in recent history. They were in hand 18 where they checked flop, turn, and made a small river bet.\n\nMy position is good (BTN). Hand is A4o - not great but has some potential with an Ace. However, A4o is a weak hand, especially against a raise.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 18 (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 12). I need to call 8. That's 8 to win 18, or about 2.25:1 odds (30.8% equity needed).\n\nImplied odds: If I hit an Ace, I could win more. But A4o is dominated by better Aces (AK, AQ, AJ, AT, etc.). If opponent has a better Ace, I'm in bad shape even if an Ace hits.\n\nTournament considerations: My stack is 30BB, which is healthy but not huge. I should be looking for better spots. A4o from BTN could be a steal attempt, but I'm facing a raise, not opening.\n\nOpponent tendencies: After folding many hands, they might be raising with a wider range now. Could be stealing from CO position (Seat 5 is CO? Actually, seat 5 is after me? Let me check: seats: 1 folded, 2 folded (SB), 3 me (BB/BTN?), 4 folded, 5 raised. Wait, I'm seat 3, position BTN. Seat 4 folded, seat 5 is CO? Actually with 5 players: seat 1 UTG, seat 2 SB, seat 3 BB/BTN, seat 4 CO?, seat 5 BTN? Hmm, the positions might be: I'm BTN (seat 3), seat 4 is SB? No, seat 2 posted SB. Let me re-read: \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\". So I'm BTN. Seat 4 folded, seat 5 raised. So seat 5 is CO? Actually in 5-handed: seats: 1 UTG, 2 SB, 3 BB/BTN, 4 CO, 5 BTN? Wait, but I'm BTN. So maybe: seat 1 UTG, seat 2 SB, seat 3 BB (but I'm BTN?), seat 4 CO, seat 5 BTN? This is confusing.\n\nRegardless, opponent raised from late position after many folds. Could be a steal with a wide range.\n\nHowever, A4o is a marginal hand. The pot odds are decent (30.8% equity needed), but A4o vs a raising range probably has less than 30% equity unless they're raising very wide.\n\nLet me think about my options:\n1. Fold: Conservative, preserve stack for better spots.\n2. Call: See flop, try to hit something. But out of position post-flop (actually I'm BTN, so I have position! That's good).\n3. Raise: Could 3-bet bluff. But with A4o and 30BB stack, 3-bet bluffing might be too aggressive.\n\nGiven I have position (BTN) and opponent has shown tightness (many folds), calling could be okay. But A4o is really weak.\n\nActually, wait - I'm the BB, not BTN? The text says \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\" but \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 4\". So I'm both BB and BTN? That means we're 5-handed and I'm both BB and BTN? Actually in 5-handed: BTN, SB, BB, UTG, CO. So if I'm BTN and also posted BB, that means the button is at seat 3 and I'm in the BB? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's mislabeled.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide. Let me check if there's more info on opponent's raising range. Let me search for raises by this opponent."

I need to call 4 chips to stay in.\n\nFrom my hand history, I can see that I've played 25 hands total and only won 2, with a very low win rate of 0.08. Most of my hands in UTG position have been weak (2d7c, 6cKs, 3s5h, Js4d, 6hTh) and I've folded all of them preflop.\n\nLooking at Seat 2 (Kimi-K2), they've been quite active:\n- They've made raises preflop in hands 21 (35 chips) and 25 (12 chips)\n- They tend to call down with decent hands (saw showdown with A-K in hand 19)\n- They've been folding some hands preflop but also raising with others\n\n**Analysis of my hand**:\n- QTs (Queen-Ten suited) is a decent hand but not premium\n- In UTG position, this is a marginal hand\n- It's suited which gives it some extra value\n- But UTG is the worst position to play marginal hands\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be out of position for the entire hand\n2. **My hand strength**: QTs is decent but not strong enough to play profitably from UTG\n3. **Stack considerations**: At 47.2 BB, I should be selective about which hands I play\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Seat 2 has shown they can raise preflop, so there might be action\n\n\n5. **Tournament strategy**: With low win rate and limited chips, preservation is key\n\nI'll opt to fold, prioritizing chip conservation and avoiding marginal plays from an unfavorable position. The QTs, while not terrible, doesn't justify the risk when I'm UTG and facing potential aggression from other players.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We have UTG with Qh Ts? Actually Th Qs (ten of hearts, queen of spades). That's a decent hand but not premium. In early position, typical raise? With 96 BB stack, standard raise to 3x BB = 12 is common. Minimum raise is 8 (to 8 total). Raise to 8 is a small raise, could be seen as weak. Could also just call (flat) 4, but flatting UTG is generally not advisable unless you have a strong hand. QT suited is decent but not strong enough to flat UTG. Raising is better to thin the field and get value. Opponent Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) is SB with 221 chips. Past behavior: they've raised preflop with 35 (hand 21), raised with 12 (hand 25). They also folded preflop multiple times. They called on later streets. They seem to be able to raise with decent hands, maybe medium strength. So raising to 8 (small) may invite a 3-bet? But they are short stack 221 chips, but still have enough. Our stack is 387, we could raise to say 12 (3x BB) which is above min raise. Legal actions: raise, call, fold. We can raise to any amount above min raise? Usually raise to any amount >= min raise. So we can raise to 12, 16, etc. With 96 BB, typical raise 2.5-3 BB preflop UTG = 10-12. Let's raise to 12. Reasoning: hand strength moderate, want to thin field, avoid multi-way pot. Also position early, want to be aggressive. Also tournament stack moderate, we can afford raise. So decision: raise to 12.\n\nCheck legal: raise_to = total amount we put in. Currently we need to call 4, raise to 12 means we put 12 total (including call). Good.\n\nReturn JSON.",

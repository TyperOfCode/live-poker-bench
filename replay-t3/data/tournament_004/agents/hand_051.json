Has folded preflop in every single hand I can see (hands 39-50)\n- This is a very tight player who defends their blind rarely\n\n**My situation:**\n- Hand: 9h 5c (very weak, offsuit, low cards)\n- Position: Button (good position)\n- Stack: 53 chips (6.6 BB) - I'm very short stacked\n- To call: 8 chips\n- Pot: 12 chips\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 9-5 offsuit is terrible. One of the worst starting hands in poker.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is good, but this hand is too weak even for that.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents are tight, especially the BB who folds everything.\n4. **Stack size**: With only 6.6 BB, I need to be very selective. This is not a hand to risk my tournament life on.\n5. **Pot odds**: 8 to win 12 = 1.5:1, which is not good enough for this hand.\n\nEven though the BB is extremely tight and might fold, and I'm on the button, 9-5 offsuit is just too weak. With my short stack, I need to preserve chips for better spots. Folding is the clear correct play here.\n\nEven if I consider a steal attempt, 9-5 offsuit has terrible post-flop playability. If called, I'll be in bad shape with a weak hand and short stack.\n\nDecision: Fold",

The pot is 32 chips, I need to call 16, and my stack is 111 chips (13.9 BB). The opponent raised to 24 total (so 16 more for me). Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, my hand: Kd 2s is a weak hand, especially out of position. K2 offsuit is not a good hand to play, especially facing a raise. I'm in the BB, so I've already put in 8 chips.\n\nMy stack is 111 chips (13.9 BB), which is relatively short but not desperately short. The opponent has 279 chips (much bigger stack).\n\nI should consider opponent tendencies. Let me use the recall tools to see how this opponent plays. But wait, I need to respond in JSON format. Let me first think through the decision.\n\nFactors:\n1. Hand strength: Very weak - K2o is a bottom-tier hand\n2. Position: I'm out of position (BB) vs button/small blind? Actually Seat 2 posted SB, so they're in SB position. I'm BB.\n3. Stack sizes: I have 111, opponent has 279\n4. Pot odds: Pot is 32, I need to call 16, so I'm getting 2:1 odds (need ~33% equity)\n5. Tournament considerations: I'm somewhat short-stacked but not critical\n\nK2o likely has less than 33% equity against a SB raising range. The SB could be raising wide, but even against a wide range, K2o is marginal.\n\nGiven I'm out of position with a weak hand, and I'm getting 2:1 odds but with poor playability postflop, I think folding is correct. Calling would commit 16 chips (14% of my stack) with a hand that will be difficult to play postflop.\n\nLet me check if there's any history with this opponent. But I need to make a decision now. I'll fold.\n\nMy reasoning: K2o is too weak to defend from BB against a raise, especially out of position. The pot odds (2:1) are decent but not enough given the poor hand strength and positional disadvantage. Better to preserve my 111-chip stack for better spots.\n\nResponse should be JSON.",

This is appropriate for UTG position where you need strong hands to play profitably.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been active preflop with several raises and calls\n- They showed down AJ and AK in previous hands, suggesting they play premium hands aggressively\n- They're still in the hand after posting the small blind\n\n**Hand Analysis**: \n- K9o is a marginal hand, especially UTG\n- King-high has decent showdown value but limited potential to improve\n- Being UTG means I'll face action from multiple players behind me\n- With only 33.4 BB, I need to be selective about which hands I play\n\n**Tournament considerations**:\n- I'm at 33.4 BB, which is a healthy stack\n- Need to preserve stack while still accumulating chips\n- Early position requires premium hands to justify playing\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. Position: UTG is the worst position - need strong hands\n2. Hand strength: K9o is weak for UTG\n3. Opponent behavior: Kimi-K2 seems aggressive with premium hands\n4. Stack size: I can afford to fold and wait for better spots\n\nThis is clearly a fold situation.

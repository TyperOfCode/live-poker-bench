They have folded preflop in most hands (hands 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39). When they did play (hands 34 and 35), they just called and then folded on the flop. This suggests they're playing very conservatively.\n\nMy hand is 7h Ts in the SB. This is a weak hand - offsuit and not connected. I have 89 chips (22.2 BB) which is a decent stack but not deep.\n\nThe action: everyone folded to GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 who raised to 8. I need to call 6 more chips to see the flop.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 14, I need to call 6, so pot odds are 14:6 or about 2.3:1. This means I need about 30% equity to break even.\n\nGiven:\n1. My hand is very weak (7To)\n2. I'm out of position (SB)\n3. Opponent is tight and likely has a strong range\n4. I have a decent but not huge stack\n5. Pot odds aren't great for this hand\n\nI should fold. Calling with this weak hand out of position against a tight opponent is -EV. Even if the pot odds seem okay, playing this hand out of position will likely lead to difficult post-flop decisions and losing more chips.\n\nFolding preserves my stack for better spots. With 22 BB, I need to be selective and look for spots to accumulate chips, not bleed them away with marginal holdings.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm UTG with 8s 3h, which is an absolutely terrible hand - 8-3 offsuit. This is one of the worst starting hands in poker. I have 119 chips (29.8 BB), which is a decent stack but not huge.\n\nLooking at the table:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): 89 chips (22.3 BB)\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): 249 chips (62.3 BB)\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 191 chips (47.8 BB)\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 345 chips (86.3 BB)\n\nFrom the search results, I can see that Kimi-K2 (seat 2) has been quite aggressive, raising preflop in several hands. In hand 31, they raised to 12 from BB after folds. In hand 32, they raised to 12 from SB. In hand 33, they raised to 12 and then re-raised to 75. In hand 35, they raised to 12 from BB. In hand 39, they raised to 12 from CO.\n\nSo Kimi-K2 is playing aggressively. There are still 4 players to act behind me: MiniMax-M2 (CO), GPT-OSS-120B (BTN), and the blinds.\n\nMy hand 8-3 offsuit is unplayable from UTG. Even with a suited connector or small pair, UTG is tough, but this is trash. The only reasonable play is to fold. Calling 4 chips with this hand would be burning money, and raising would be even worse.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I have 29.8 BB, which is a playable stack. I should wait for better spots. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nPot odds: I'd need to call 4 into a pot of 6, giving me 1.5:1 odds, but the hand is so weak that even with these odds, I can't continue.\n\nPosition: UTG is the worst position - I'll have to act first on every street.\n\nSo the clear decision is to fold.",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop with 9h Jh on button, stacks: us 345, SB 2, BB 4, others folded. Opponent seats: seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is SB with 89 chips, seat2 (Kimi-K2) is BB with 249 chips.\n\nWe are BTN, after SB and BB posted, it's our turn. Amount to call is 4 (BB). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to total 8). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand: 9h Jh \u2013 suited connectors, decent hand on button, can open raise. Stack 86 BB, deep enough. Opponents: SB (89 chips, 22.25 BB) is short stack; BB (249 chips, 62 BB). Need to consider opponent tendencies: recall shows seat1 (SB) raised preflop in some past hands, amounts 6,12,12,16,12. So they are aggressive, maybe 3-bet? In those hands they raised from SB (post sb 2) to amount 6 (i.e., raise to 6) which is 3x SB? Actually raise to 6 means they raised to total 6, so 4 over call. That's a 3-bet? Wait initial bet is BB 4, call would be 4, raise to 8 minimum. So raise to 6 is below min raise? Not possible. Maybe they raised from SB after posting 2, before BB? Actually order: SB posts 2, then BB posts 4, then action goes to UTG etc. But in this scenario, only SB and BB present. But recall may be from other tables where there were more players; anyway SB shows raises preflop, maybe 3-bets or open raises.\n\nSeat2 (BB) no data. Might be tighter.\n\nGiven we are on button, 9hJh is a good raise. Also we have a short stack behind (SB 89 chips). If we raise to 8, SB may call or shove (since 89 chips). 8 is small relative to SB's stack, they could go all-in. But raising too small may invite call and we might get in a multiway pot with a weak hand vs stronger ranges. However 9hJh is decent for 3-bet? Could also consider 3-bet (re-raise) to isolate SB? But we are first to act after blinds, so it's open raise. Could also consider a limp? Not advisable with suited connectors.\n\nThus raise to 8 (minimum raise) seems fine. Reason: we want to build pot, take advantage of position, and pressure short stack.\n\nCheck if we can raise more. Minimum raise 8, we could raise to e.g., 15. But deeper stacks can call, but we might want to size to isolate SB. SB has 89 chips, they'd likely call a raise of 15? Might still call. A larger raise might discourage call but also risk being re-raised by BB (big stack) who could have a strong hand.\n\nGiven tournament early stage, we can raise to 12 (3x BB) to apply pressure. But legal minimum raise is 8, we can raise higher. However we need to consider pot odds: if BB calls, we will be in 3-way with 9hJh vs unknown ranges. Might be okay.\n\nGiven our hand is decent but not premium, a standard raise to 8 (2x BB) is fine to see flop.\n\nThus choose raise to 8.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

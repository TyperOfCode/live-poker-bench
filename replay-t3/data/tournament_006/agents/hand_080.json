            "reasoning_content": "  I'm in the BTN (Button) position with 8d 7h. Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 8-7 offsuit is a marginal hand. It's suited (no, wait - 8d 7h is offsuit, not suited). So it's a weak suited connector... actually, it's offsuit. So it's even weaker. Not a great hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is the best position post-flop. This gives me an advantage if I see a flop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 140 chips, which is 8.8 BB. This is a short stack in tournament play. With a short stack, I need to be more selective about which hands I play, but when I do play, I should often be looking to get my chips in.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 24 chips, and I need to call 16. That's 1.5:1 pot odds. Not great.\n\n5. **Opponents**: \n   - SB (Seat 2) has 437 chips (27.3 BB) - deep stack\n   - BB (Seat 3) has 218 chips (13.6 BB) - medium stack\n\nWith 8.8 BB, I'm in a critical spot. I should be looking for spots to either:\n- Fold and preserve my stack for better hands\n- Shove all-in with decent hands to maximize fold equity\n\n8-7 offsuit is not a good hand to shove with from the button. It's too weak. Even though I'm on the button, this hand doesn't play well against typical calling ranges.\n\nLet me think about what hands I should be shoving with from the button with 8.8 BB. Typically, I'd want:\n- Any pocket pair\n- Any Ace\n- Any two Broadway cards\n- Suited connectors (maybe)\n- Some Kx and Qx hands\n\n8-7 offsuit is just too weak. I should fold here and wait for a better spot. The fact that I'm on the button doesn't overcome the weakness of this hand with such a short stack.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold based on basic tournament strategy with a short stack and a weak hand.\n\nDecision: FOLD",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with 4s Ts, 13.6 BB stack. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted SB 8 and called 8 more to complete the blind. So they just limped in from the SB. The pot is 32 chips (16 BB + 8 SB + 8 call). I have position (BB) and it's checked to me.\n\nLooking at opponent's actions: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown varied play. In hand 76, they limped from SB then checked through flop and turn, then bet river with 7c Kh (they won). In hand 78, they raised preflop to 48 (3x BB). In hand 79, they checked from BB when action folded to them.\n\nMy hand: 4s Ts is a weak hand. However, I have position and a limper who likely has a weak to medium range. At 13.6 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate. The pot is 32 chips and it costs me 0 to check.\n\nOptions:\n1. Check: Take a free flop with weak hand. Low risk.\n2. Raise: Could try to steal the limper's dead money. Minimum raise to 32 (putting 16 more chips).\n\nPot odds: If I raise to 32, I'm risking 16 more chips to win 32, getting 2:1 immediate odds. If called, I'll have 186 left (32 in pot, ~6:1 SPR).\n\nTournament considerations: At 13.6 BB, I need to accumulate chips soon, but also can't afford to spew. 4s Ts has some postflop playability (can make straights, flushes, though not premium).\n\nOpponent tendency: They limped from SB, which suggests weakness. They might fold to a raise. But if they call, I'll be out of position postflop (actually no, I'm BB, they're SB, so I have position).\n\nActually wait: SB called to complete, so they're in SB, I'm BB. Postflop, SB acts first, so I have position! That's good.\n\nGiven the situation:\n- Weak limper from SB\n- I have position\n- Pot already has 32 chips (2 BB)\n- My stack is 13.6 BB\n\nI think a small raise could be good here. If I raise to 32 (putting 16 more), I risk 16 to win 32. If they fold 50% of time, it's profitable. Given they limped weak, they might fold often.\n\nBut 4s Ts is really weak. Maybe better to check and see a flop. However, checking gives up initiative.\n\nLet me think about stack sizes: I have 218, opponent has 429. If I raise and get called, pot will be 64, I'll have 186 left (2.9x pot). That's workable.\n\nActually, looking at my recent hands: In hand 76 (also BB), I had Jd 2s and checked, then won with two pair. But that was against multiple players.\n\nI think with position and a weak limper, raising could be good. But 4s Ts is bottom of range. Maybe check is safer.\n\nWait, I should consider: If I check, we see flop with 32 pot. If I raise and get called, pot is 64. My raise size would be small (just doubling the pot).\n\nActually, minimum raise to 32 is just putting 16 more. That's not a strong raise. Might not get much fold equity.\n\nBetter to either check or make a more substantial raise. But with my stack, a bigger raise commits me.\n\nI think checking is reasonable here. Take free flop with speculative hand. If flop hits me, I can play. If not, I can fold.\n\nBut tournament pressure: at 13.6 BB, I should be looking for spots. This might be a spot.\n\nLet me check opponent showdowns: They showed 7c Kh when they limped and won. So they limp with K7o. That's weak.\n\nDecision: I'll check. Take free flop with weak speculative hand. If flop gives me a draw or pair, I can continue.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking with 4s Ts against SB limper.

The pot is 32 chips, and amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nMy hand is weak: 4s Ts is not a strong hand. It's suited, which gives some flush potential, but overall it's a weak hand. I'm out of position against the SB limper.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 2 has shown some mixed actions - they've limped (called SB), raised preflop, and folded. They seem to be playing a reasonable range. They showed down hands like 9h Jc, Jh Ac, Qh Qs, Ah Js, 7c Kh. So they play some decent hands.\n\nGiven my stack size (13.6 BB), I need to be careful about committing chips with weak hands. However, I'm getting to see a free flop with a suited hand from the BB. The pot odds are excellent since I don't have to put any more chips in.\n\nRaising here with 4s Ts would be spewy - I'd be bloating the pot out of position with a weak hand. Folding would be too tight when I get to see a free flop.\n\nBest play is to check and see a flop. If I hit something like a flush draw or pair, I can continue. Otherwise, I can fold cheaply.\n\nSo I should check.",

I have:\n- No pair\n- Backdoor straight draw: I need a 9 for a straight (9 gives me 9-10-J-Q, but I have 4-10, so actually need 6-7-9 for a straight? Let's check: 4-5-8-J-Q, no real straight draw)\n- Backdoor flush draw? I have spades, board has hearts and clubs, so no flush draw\n- Basically I have nothing but a weak Ten-high\n\nHowever, my opponent checked twice (flop and turn). From the opponent data:\n- They've shown some aggression (raised preflop in hand 78, bet flop in hand 78, bet river in hand 76)\n- But they've also checked multiple times when they have weak hands\n- They had 7c Kh in hand 76 and bet river when checked to\n\nGiven the small pot (32 chips, just 2 BB) and my weak hand, I should probably check and see a free river. If I bet, I risk getting raised and having to fold, or I might get called by better hands. The pot is too small to bluff aggressively.\n\nMy stack is 218 (13.6 BB) - relatively short but not desperate. The opponent has 429 chips, so they have me covered.\n\n**Decision**: Check and see a free river. If I hit something on river (a Ten or maybe a straight draw completes), I can reconsider. But betting with nothing into a checked turn seems risky with such a weak hand.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors... The board has Qc Jh 8h 5h - there are flush draws (hearts) and straight draws possible. My opponent could be checking with a draw. If I bet, I might fold out some weak hands, but I might also get raised by draws or better hands.\n\nGiven my position (out of position) and weak hand, checking is best.",

No straight possible.\n\nOpponent (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) bet 32 into 64 pot on river after checking flop and turn. This is a half-pot bet.\n\nFrom the opponent history, I can see:\n- In hand #76 (similar situation where we were heads-up from BB vs SB), opponent bet 24 on river after checking flop and turn, and I called with J2 on board 4s 6c Js 8s 2c (I had two pair). That time they were bluffing or had weaker hand.\n\n- Opponent has shown some aggression with raises preflop (hands 67, 74, 78) but also folds a lot preflop.\n\n- They checked this hand preflop as SB (just called to complete), then checked flop and turn.\n\nThe bet sizing (half pot) could be value or bluff. With this board (Ace high, no flush), they could have:\n- Ace with weak kicker (they'd bet for value)\n- Queen or Jack (might bet)\n- Complete bluff trying to take it down\n\nPot odds: I need to call 32 to win 96 (64 pot + 32 bet). That's 33% pot odds.\n\nMy hand has 0% chance to win unless they're bluffing. I need them to be bluffing >33% of the time for this call to be profitable.\n\nMy stack: 218 chips (13.6 BB). Calling 32 would be ~15% of my stack. Not huge but meaningful.\n\nGiven the board texture and opponent's checking pattern (check-check-check then bet river), this looks like either:\n1. They hit their Ace on river (had Ax) and now betting for value\n2. They have a weak Queen or Jack and think it's good\n3. They're bluffing with missed draw (hearts? but only 2 hearts on board - 8h and Jh, plus Qc, 5h, Ad - actually 3 hearts: 8h, 5h, Jh. Possible flush draw that missed)\n\nActually there are 3 hearts on board: 8h, 5h, Jh. So a heart flush is possible but not there (need 2 hearts). Could be bluffing missed flush.\n\nBut with my terrible hand (Ten-high), I can't beat any legitimate hand. Even if they're bluffing 40% of the time, calling is borderline.\n\nLooking at my own history: In hand #76, I called a similar river bet with two pair and won. But here I have nothing.\n\nTournament consideration: I have 13.6 BB, which is short but not critical. Folding preserves stack for better spots.\n\nI think this is a clear fold. The pot odds aren't good enough given my hand strength is essentially zero. Even if they're bluffing sometimes, I need them to be bluffing very frequently, and with Ace on board, they might have Ace-rag and think it's good.\n\nWait, they just called preflop as SB, didn't raise. So their range is wide: any two cards basically. Could include many weak hands.\n\nBut still, with Ten-high, I can't call. I'd need at least a pair or some draw.\n\nLet me check if there's any other consideration: Position - I'm out of position, they bet into me. They might think I'll fold weak hands.\n\nActually, I should consider that they might think I'm weak since I checked all streets. But same for them.\n\nI think fold is correct."

I'd need at least a pair or some draw.\n\nLet me check if there's any other consideration: Position - I'm out of position, they bet into me. They might think I'll fold weak hands.\n\nActually, I should consider that they might think I'm weak since I checked all streets. But same for them.\n\nI think fold is correct.",

Not worth it with such a weak hand.\n\nTournament considerations: I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nDecision: fold.\n\nNow format as JSON: {\"action\": \"fold\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"Brief explanation\"}\n\nReasoning should be brief but clear.

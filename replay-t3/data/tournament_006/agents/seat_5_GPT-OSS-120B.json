So both seem willing to raise preflop, possibly with a range of hands. We're on BTN with Kd6d (unsuited, not connected). Hand strength: about 10% preflop. In BTN, we could open raise to 4 (min raise) or call 2 (just limp). Considering opponents likely raise if we limp? Actually they are in blinds, they could raise after we act? Wait preflop order: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then we are BTN (last to act). The amount to call is 2 (BB). So we can call 2, raise to at least 4 (total). If we raise, we may isolate against SB and BB. Kd6d is weak, not a good raise. Better to fold or call? In BTN, limping is generally not recommended with weak hands. Folding is safe. However, we have decent stack (98.5 BB). We could call 2 and see flop cheap. But opponents may raise after us? Actually after BTN, action goes to SB then BB? No, preflop order: SB, BB, then BTN, then remaining players (but only these three are left). After BTN acts, action ends preflop; SB and BB already posted blinds and cannot raise again unless there is a raise. So if we call, we go to flop with SB and BB having posted 1 and 2 respectively. So we would see flop cheap.\n\nGiven Kd6d is not a strong hand, but suited? Actually Kd6d both diamonds, suited! So it's a suited king with 6, potential flush draws, but still weak. In BTN, we could limp to see flop cheap, but also risk being out of position after flop (we will be first to act preflop? Actually after flop, BTN is last to act preflop, but after flop the order is SB, BB, BTN (so BTN is last). So being last is advantage. So limping might be okay with suited connectors, but K6 suited is borderline. Many players fold K6 suited from BTN. Could also raise to isolate and maybe take down blinds. However opponents have been raising preflop, indicating they may have wide ranges. A raise could get them to fold, but they are likely to call with many hands. Might be okay to raise to 4 (2 BB) to steal blinds. But K6 suited is not a premium hand to raise. In tournament early stage, you can steal with many hands. However our stack is 98.5 BB, not short. So we can be selective.\n\nI think best action: fold? But we have already posted no money except maybe we are not forced. The amount to call is 2 (BB). Folding loses nothing. Calling 2 is cheap. Might be okay to limp. I'd lean to call to see flop because suited king can make top pair or flush. Also being last to act postflop is beneficial.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Board: 2s Kh 7d. Our hand: 6d Kd. So we have top pair (K) with decent kicker (6). Actually board has K, we have Kd, so we have pair of Kings, with K kicker? Actually we have Kd, board K is hearts, so we have a pair of Kings, plus a 6 kicker. Opponent (Seat2) bet 4 into pot 9 (so pot becomes 13 after bet). Stack sizes: we have 195, opponent has 172. Our stack is large relative to bet.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies. We have no info yet. Could be a continuation bet (c-bet) from BB. Preflop: BB (Seat2) checked, we called 2 from BTN, then BB checked. So opponent checked preflop, maybe they have a wide range, maybe they have missed the flop. Board has a King, we have K, they may have missed. They bet 4, maybe they have a piece of the board: maybe they have a King, a 2, a 7, or a draw. Could be a bluff. We have top pair, likely best hand. Should we raise? Consider pot odds: pot 13, bet 4, we can call 4 to win 13+4=17? Actually pot after bet is 13 (9+4). If we call, we invest 4 to win 13 (since opponent's bet is included). So pot odds ~ 4/(13+4?) Wait: pot before call is 13 (includes opponent's bet). If we call 4, total pot we can win is 13, we invest 4, so odds 4:13 ~ 23.5% needed, we have top pair, likely > 50% equity. So call is fine. Raising could extract value if opponent has weaker hand like a lower pair (7,2) or a draw. Minimum raise is 8 (total). Raising to 8 would be a raise of 4 more (total 8). That would be 8 total (including call). That would be a raise of 4 over call. Opponent could call or raise. Could be good for value.\n\nBut we need to consider stack depth: opponent has 172, we have 195. Raising to 8 is small relative to stacks, but could be okay.\n\nWe also consider tournament: we have decent stack 97.5 BB, we can preserve.\n\nGiven we have top pair, we could call and see turn, but raising might be good to protect against draws (2-7 board no straight draws). Actually board: 2-7-K, possible straight draws: 3-4-5-6? Not present. There's a gutshot 3-4-5 for a straight draw? Actually need 4 cards: 2-7-K, you could have 3-4-5 for a straight draw needing 8? No. So no immediate draws. So we can just call.\n\nCheck if opponent is likely to fold to raise? They bet, so they have some strength. Raising could get called by worse hands and also by draws. Might be profitable.\n\nGiven we have top pair, I think raising to 8 is good for value. However we need to consider opponent's range: they could have Kx (maybe they have K9, KQ etc). If they have Kx, they'd have two pair (K K) maybe? Actually board has K, they could have Kx, they'd have top pair as well, but they might have K2 for trips? Actually board K, they have K? That would be two pair? No, board K, they have K, they'd have pair of Kings (same as us). If they have K2, they'd have K with a 2 kicker, we have K6, we are ahead. If they have K7 they'd have K7 (two pair? Actually board has 7, so they'd have K7 = two pair K and 7). That would beat our K6? Yes, K7 > K6. So raising could be risky if opponent has K7. Probability? Not huge.\n\nAlso they could have 7x, giving them pair of 7s, we beat them. They could have 2x, pair of 2s, we beat. Could have a flush draw? No hearts: board hearts only K hearts. We have Kd, not heart. Opponent could have hearts for flush draw? Only one heart on board, need 4 hearts. Not possible.\n\nThus raising is good.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. We'll raise to 8 total.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually amount to call is 2 (big blind). Minimum raise to 4 (so raise to total 4). Need to consider opponent tendencies. We have data: opponent seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop to 6 in hand #2. That's a raise of 6 (to 6 total) which is 3x BB (since BB is 2). So they may be aggressive. But we don't know other data. We have no info on seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) or seat 1. But seat 2 is SB and we are UTG. Our hand QK offsuit (queen king unsuited). That's a decent hand, but from UTG it's strong enough to raise in many games. In tournament with 102 BB stack, we can raise to 4 (2x BB) or maybe bigger. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to total 4). That's a standard raise. Should we raise? QK offsuit is a premium-ish hand, especially UTG. Likely we want to open raise to build pot and isolate. Also consider opponent tendencies: seat 2 has raised previously, maybe they are willing to 3-bet? But we are first to act after SB and BB posted. Actually order: seat 2 is SB posted 1, seat 3 is BB posted 2, seat 4 folded, seat 5 is us UTG? Wait seat numbers: seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat 2 is Kimi-K2, seat 3 DeepSeek-V3.2, seat 4 MiniMax-M2 (folded), seat 5 us. Position UTG seat 5? Usually UTG is first after big blind, but seat numbers may be different. The order: preflop: seat 2 post_sb 1, seat 3 post_bb 2, seat 4 fold, then it's our turn (seat 5). So we are first to act after blinds. So we can raise. Raise to 4 is standard. Should we consider 3-betting? Our stack is deep (102 BB), but typical open raise is 2.5-3 BB. Minimum raise to 4 is 2 BB (since big blind 2). Actually 4 total = 2 BB, which is small. Could we raise to bigger? The legal actions are fold, call, raise, but raise_to we can set any amount >= minimum raise. Probably we can raise more. Should we raise to maybe 6 or 8? Considering seat 2 may be aggressive, but we can open raise to 6 to isolate and protect. However we might want to keep pot manageable. QK offsuit is a strong hand, but from UTG we should be careful. I think raise to 6 (3 BB) is good. But we need to ensure we have enough chips; we have 204, so fine.\n\nWe also have seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) still to act after us? Actually after our action, seat 1 will act (since they are on left of us). They have 205 chips. They may call or raise. So we need to set raise amount that is appropriate. I'd raise to 6.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 6, reasoning: hand strength, position, tournament, etc.\n\n",

Pot currently 28 chips (small blind 1, big blind 2, plus our raise 6? Let's compute: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then seat5 (us) raise to 6 (so we put 6 total, meaning we added 4 more). Then seat2 (UTG?) raises to 20 (so they re-raise). Now amount to call is 14 (since we have 6 in, need to call 20 total, so 14 more). Minimum raise to 34 (i.e., raise by at least 14 more? Actually raise to 34 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Opponent seat2 is Kimi-K2 with 152 chips. We have limited info: we recall a previous raise by Kimi-K2 preflop of 6 in hand #2. Not much else. No further pattern.\n\nOur hand QdKs is decent but not premium. In BB facing a raise from UTG (likely early position) to 20 (10x big blind). That's a 10bb raise. Stack sizes moderate. We have 99 BB stack, deep. QK offsuit? Actually Qd Ks is offsuit (Qd and Ks). That's a decent hand but not a top 10. Usually you would fold to 10bb raise from early position with QK offsuit? Many players would call or 3-bet depending on dynamics. In tournament with 99 BB, you can be a bit aggressive. But we are out of position post-flop. Also the raise is from seat2 (likely UTG). Our position is BB, we are out of position. QK off is a good hand to 3-bet for value and to take initiative. But we need to consider opponent's range: early position raise could be strong: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK, maybe AQ, maybe AJs, maybe KQs, maybe suited connectors. QK off is in that range as a call maybe but also a 3-bet candidate.\n\nWe have 198 chips, opponent 152 chips. So we could 3-bet to 34 (minimum raise). That would be 34 total, meaning we add 28 more chips (since we have 6 already). That would be a raise of 34 total (i.e., 34-20 = 14 extra? Actually minimum raise to 34 means total bet of 34, so we need to put 34 total, we currently have 6, need to add 28. So raise amount = 28 chips more, total 34). That's a 17bb raise (since 34/2). That's a decent size.\n\nAlternatively we could call 14 to see flop. But QK off vs early raise is maybe +EV to call? Let's compute pot odds: pot currently 28 (including blinds and our raise) + opponent's raise 20 (so pot after they raise = 28 + 20? Actually the pot before decision includes all bets: SB 1, BB 2, our raise to 6, opponent raise to 20. So total pot = 1+2+6+20 = 29? Wait we need to sum: SB 1, BB 2, our raise to 6 (so we contributed 6 total, not additional 4?), opponent raise to 20 (so they contributed 20). So total = 1+2+6+20 = 29. But the problem statement says pot: 28 chips. Slight discrepancy maybe they count differently. Anyway pot about 28. If we call 14, pot becomes ~42. So we would be calling 14 into pot 28 => 2:1 odds. So we need to have >33% equity. QK offsuit vs early raise range maybe ~30%? Might be borderline. So a call could be okay if we think we have equity. But raising could also be good to take initiative and maybe win pot preflop.\n\nGiven we have deep stack, we might want to 3-bet to isolate and take control. But we need to consider opponent's tendencies: we have only one prior raise of 6 (small) from them, not informative. Could be a loose player. In early position, small raise 6 (3bb) maybe indicates a wide range. If they raise to 20 now (10bb) maybe they are strong. Actually that is the raise we are facing. So we can't gauge.\n\nGiven tournament stage unknown, but we have decent stack. I think best action: raise to minimum 34 to 3-bet. Reason: QK offsuit is strong enough to 3"

No, Ac9d is offsuit (clubs and diamonds). In SB with 111.5 BB stack, fairly deep. Ac9d is a decent hand but not premium. Considering opponent in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called big blind, likely a decent range maybe wide. In SB we are out of position postflop. Should we raise to isolate? With 111 BB, we could raise to 4 (min raise) to try to steal. But opponent already called, so raising might isolate against a player who likely calls wide. Ac9d is not great for 3-bet; could fold. But also we have good equity vs unknown range. However typical SB play: with A9 off-suit, many would just call or fold. Raising could be okay to try to take pot preflop, but risk of being 3-bet by stronger. Since opponent just called, maybe they have a wide range, so a raise could get folds from weaker.

Wait actions: preflop seat4 called 2 (big blind?), seat5 called 1 (SB). So after preflop, we have three players: seat1 (BB) posted 2, seat4 called 2, seat5 called 1. Then flop check each: seat5 check, seat1 check, seat4 check. So all three are still in. Turn now, it's seat5's turn (SB) first? Actually order: after flop, action proceeds from SB? Usually order is SB first preflop, then BB, then UTG etc. On flop, after preflop, action starts with first active player left of button. Since SB is seat5, BB seat1, seat4 is CO?

Our hand: Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: board has 6,4,K,7. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9? Actually we have 9, board 6,7,? 8 missing, 5 missing. So we have a gutshot: need 8 to make 6-7-8-9-10? Wait 6-7-8-9-10 would need 8 and 10. Not correct. Let's compute possible draws: With 9, we could have a straight 5-6-7-8-9 (need 5 and 8). Not present. So not immediate. Also we have Ace high, no pair. We have a backdoor flush? Board has two spades (6\u2660,7\u2660). We have no spade, so no flush draw. So basically we have Ace high, no draw. Opponent (Seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking) bet 10 on turn. Pot before bet: 16 chips (pre-turn). Actually after flop check, pot still 16? Let's compute: Preflop: blinds 1/2, pot 3 (1+2). Then seat4 called 2, seat5 called 1 (makes total 1+2+2+1 =6?). Wait preflop: seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2, seat4 call 2 (that's a raise? Actually seat4 is in UTG? but they called 2). seat5 call 1 (completes small blind). So pot after preflop: 1+2+2+1 =6. Then flop: all check, pot remains 6. Turn: seat5 check, seat1 bet 10, seat4 fold. So pot before bet: 6. After bet 10, pot becomes 16 (6+10). The amount to call is 10, pot after call would be 26 (if we call). So pot odds: 10 to call, pot 16 (plus our call 10 => 26). So we need 10/26 = 38.5% equity to call break even. Our hand Ace high vs opponent's range. Opponent's betting pattern: Turn bet 10 after board 6s 4c Ks 7s. He could have a variety: maybe a pair (Kx, 6,7), or a draw (flush draw? but board has two spades; opponent could have spade). He could also have Ace high but maybe slower. He bet 10 which is 5 BB (since BB=2). That's a relatively big bet (5 BB) on turn after checking flop. Could be a value bet with Kx or a semi-bluff with spade draw? But there are two spades on board, so a spade draw would be a gutshot? Actually need 2 spades to make flush: board has 2 spades, need 2 more spades in hand (both spades) for a made flush. Opponent could have a spade flush draw with one spade? Actually to have a flush draw, need 4 spades total (3 on board + 1 in hand) for a draw (i.e., have one spade, board has 3 spades). But board only has 2 spades, so a flush draw needs 2 spades in hand (i.e., a \"double suited\" hand). That's less common. So likely not a flush draw.\n\nThus opponent likely has a hand like Kx, 6x, 7x, maybe 8-9 for straight draw? Board: 6-4-K-7. Straight draws: open-ended? 5-6-7-8-9: need 5 and 8. Not there. 6-7-8-9-10: need 8 and 10. Not there. So no immediate draws.\n\nThus opponent probably bets with a made hand (pair, two pair, set) or a bluff. Let's consider his range: He could have Kx (top pair) maybe with kicker. Could also have 6x or 7x (middle pair). Could have 4x (pair). Could have a straight draw like 8-9? Actually 8-9 would give open-ended? 6-7-8-9-10 not there. So no.\n\nThus our Ace high is likely losing. So folding is appropriate.\n\nBut we also need to consider stack sizes: we have 222"

Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise by at least 2 more). Need decide action.\n\nConsider hand strength: K7 offsuit (7h Ks) is a decent but not premium hand. On button, can open raise. However stack deep 111 BB, so can raise larger.\n\nOpponent tendencies: seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop in two recent hands to 8 (from small blind) likely a raise of 8 (4x BB). That suggests they are willing to raise larger. Seat2 (Kimi-K2) is big blind; unknown.\n\nWe are on button, can either call or raise. In tournament, with 111 BB, can be aggressive. K7o is a marginal hand; many players would raise from button with it, but also can call to see flop cheap. Since we have position, can open raise to maybe 6-8 chips (3-4 BB) to isolate. But we need to consider opponent's likely response: if we raise, seat1 (SB) may 3-bet? They have been raising to 8 (maybe 4x). If we raise to 6, they could 3-bet to 16? Not sure. Our stack is deep; but we risk playing a marginal hand out of position? Actually we have position.\n\nGiven we are button with K7o, typical open raise size is 2.5-3 BB (5-6 chips). Minimum raise is 4 total, which is 2 BB. That's too small; better raise to 6. That is 3 BB total.\n\nWe also consider that we have 111 BB, we can afford a raise. I think raise to 6 chips.\n\nReason: we want to apply pressure, take pot, have position, and our hand has decent equity vs random hands. Also we can fold if re-raised.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to: 6.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Action to act: we are BTN after check, amount to call 0, min raise 4, legal actions: fold, check, raise. We need decide.\n\nOur hand: 7h Ks. On board: Ace high, with 6s, 3h. We have king high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: board 6, A,3. Straight possibilities: 4-5-6-7-8? Not. We have 7, so we have 7,6,? need 5,4 for straight, not present. 7 also could be part of A-2-3-4-5? No. So no straight draw. Flush draw? We have hearts 7h, board hearts: 3h only, so need two more hearts. No flush draw. So we have just king high, no pair. Opponent checked. Likely weak or also missed. Could be they have Ace (maybe they have Ace, something). Could be they have 6x for pair, or a draw like 5-4 for straight draw? Actually 5-4 would give open-ended straight draw (4-5-6-7-8) but need 8 or 2? Wait board 6 A 3. With 5-4, you have 4-5-6, need 2 or 7 for straight. Not immediate. So not typical.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, but we are in position, we could check to see if they bet later. Raising could be a bluff to steal pot (14). Minimum raise 4 => raise to 4 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call 0, raise to 4 means we put 4 chips in. That would be a 4 chip bet, pot becomes 18. Opponent may call with weak hands. Is that a good bluff? Our stack is 216 chips, deep. Opponent stack 203. They are shortish but still decent. They checked. Could be they have Ace high, maybe they will check-turn as well. Might be okay to check and see if they bet later.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: stack sizes moderate, 108 BB. Not huge. Should preserve chips. With king high, we probably should check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have a turn situation. Board: 6s Ac 3h Th. Our hand: 7h Ks. So we have K7 offsuit. Currently we have a gutshot? Board: A, T, 6, 3. We have K7, so currently we have top pair? No, we have no pair. We have a gutshot straight draw? The board has A, T, 6, 3. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q? Not relevant. 7 would give us a straight if 8 and 9 appear? Actually need 8-9 to make 6-7-8-9-10? We have 7, board 6 and T, need 8 and 9. Not a straight draw. Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? We have 7h, board has 3h, so one heart, need two more hearts on river. Not strong.\n\nOpponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking. He bet 10 into pot 24 on turn. So pot before bet 24, his bet 10 makes pot 34 if called. He bet relatively small (about 0.4 pot). Could be a continuation bet, maybe a weak hand or a draw. He checked flop. Preflop he called our raise 6 after we raised from BB? Actually we raised to 6, he called 5 (so put 6 total). Preflop pot after raise: 1+2+6+5 =14? Actually SB 1, BB 2, us raise 6 (so we put 6), he call 5 (since he already posted 2 blind? Wait seat1 is SB, posted 1, then call 5 to match 6 total, so he adds 5). So pot after preflop: SB 1+5 =6, BB 2, us 6 = total 14? plus maybe? Actually pot = 1+2+6+5 =14. Flop: check-check, pot remains 14. Turn: he bets 10, so pot becomes 24 (14+10). Wait given pot is 24 before his bet? The description says Pot: 24 chips before turn? Actually the hand summary says Pot: 24 chips at start of turn. Then he bets 10, amount to call 10. So pot after bet would be 34. So his bet is less than half pot (10 into 24). That's a small bet.\n\nOur stack 216, we have 206 after our raise? Actually we have 216 total, we put 6 preflop, so 210 left. He called 5, so his stack now 188? Not needed.\n\nWe need to decide fold, call, raise. Our hand K7 offsuit, no pair, no draw. Likely we should fold. But we might consider call if we think he is weak and we could bluff later? But we have no equity. The turn bet could be a continuation bet with Ace, Ten, maybe a pair of Ace, Ten, etc. We have no showdown value.\n\nThus best is fold.\n\nWe can also recall opponent tendencies: we have recall of previous turn bet of 10. That previous hand maybe similar? But we just got that info. Not enough.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have 9h9c in BB, stack 197. Already posted 4. Opponent seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 36 after our raise to 12. So action order: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, we (BB) raised to 12 (so added 8 more). Then seat1 (UTG? Actually seat1 is after BB? In order: seats 1-5? But we have seat5 BB, seat1 is to our left? Anyway they raised to 36 (so total 36). So amount to call is 24 (36-12). Minimum raise to 60 (i.e., raise by at least 24 more). We have 9s, a pocket pair, decent but not premium. Stack 197, effective stack after posting? Our remaining stack after initial raise: we have 197 total, we posted 4 and raised to 12, meaning we put total 12, leaving 185. Opponent's stack is 184. So effective stack ~185.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking's raise sizes: earlier raises 8, 8, 12 (small). This time they raised to 36 (big). Might indicate stronger hand? But they could be raising wide.\n\nWe have a medium pair, could consider 3-betting or just call. With 49 BB, we can afford a 3-bet. A 3-bet to 60 would be 48 more (since we already have 12 in). That would be a sizable raise, maybe isolate.\n\nGiven we are in BB, we have position disadvantage postflop (out of position vs UTG). 9s is vulnerable to overcards. Might want to call and see flop, but risk being dominated.\n\nPot odds: call 24 into pot 54+24? Actually current pot 54 (includes our raise 12 and opponent's raise to 36? Let's compute: initial pot: SB 2 + BB 4 =6. Our raise to 12 adds 8 more (we put 12 total). So pot becomes 6+12=18. Then opponent raises to 36, adds 24 more (they put 36 total). So pot now 18+24=42? Wait also includes opponent's previous 2? Actually they posted 2? No they are seat1 maybe not blind. So pot after their raise: previous pot 18 + opponent's additional 24 = 42. Plus our 12 already in pot. So total pot before our decision is 42? But also includes opponent's 36 total and our 12 total and blinds 6. So 42. To call 24, pot becomes 66. So pot odds = 24/66 = 0.363 ~ 36% needed to break even. Pair 9s vs random? Equity maybe around 55% vs random? Actually vs random hand, pocket pair ~55% preflop. So call is profitable.\n\nBut opponent may have range narrower (they raised big). Might be strong. But still 9s is okay.\n\nConsider tournament: 49 BB is decent, we can preserve.\n\nThus likely call.\n\nWe could also 3-bet to isolate, but risk bigger pot.\n\nI will call.\n\n",

Wait seat3 posted sb 2, seat4 posted bb 4. That's weird: seat3 is SB, seat4 is BB, but we are seat5 also BB? The structure: maybe seat3 is SB, seat4 is BB, seat5 is us in BB? Actually we are BB seat5, but they posted sb and bb earlier seats. Might be mislabel. Anyway pot 78. Board: 6d Ad 4c. We have pocket 9s, no pair on board. Overcards: Ace on board, we have no Ace, so we are behind any Ace. We have middle pair? Actually we have 9s, board 6, A, 4. So we have a gutshot? Straight draws? 9 with board 6, A,4: we need 5 or 7 for straight? 5 gives 4-5-6-? Actually 4-5-6-? need 7? Not. 7 gives 4-5-6-7? No 5 missing. So no immediate draws. So we have just a medium pair (9s) which is currently best hand? Actually opponent's range: they raised preflop to 36 (3BB) and we called. That is a 3-bet? Actually initial raise to 12 by us, then seat1 re-raised to 36 (3-bet). So they 3-bet us. So they have strong range: broadways, Aces, maybe 9s, etc. On flop Ace high, they likely have Ace or strong combos. Our 9s are likely behind. We have only overpair to board? Actually board has 6, A,4. Our 9s are just a pair, not overpair (overpair would be >A). So we are likely losing. Should we check? Opponent's action? No action yet on flop; we are first to act? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking. The flop action order: starting from UTG? Usually action starts with first active left of button. Button is seat? Not given. But we are BB, seat5. Seat1 is earlier seat (maybe UTG). So seat1 likely acts first. But we have no action yet. The legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. Raising might be a bluff. But we have small stack 173 chips (43 BB). Pot 78. Raising could be a semi-bluff attempt to steal pot if opponent is weak. But opponent likely strong. So best is check and hope they check behind. If they bet, we can consider folding. So choose check.\n\nThus JSON: action check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with pocket 9s. Board: 6d Ad 4c. Opponent (Seat1) bet 50 into pot 128. So pot before bet? Preflop pot: blinds 2+4 =6 + raise 12+36? Actually preflop: BB raised to 12, then Seat1 raise to 36 (i.e., 3-bet). Then BB called 24 (to match 36). So pot after preflop: 2+4+12+36+24? Let's compute: initial blinds 2 (SB) +4 (BB). Then BB raise to 12 (adds 8 more). Then Seat1 raise to 36 (adds 24 more). Then BB call 24 (adds 24). So total = 2+4+12+36+24 = 78. Wait also SB posted 2 (Seat3) but they folded preflop, still part of pot. So pot = 78. Flop: BB checked, Seat1 bets 50. So pot now 128 (as given). Good.\n\nOur hand: pocket 9s, board: A6 4. No pair, no straight draw (9 doesn't help). Overcards: Ace on board, we have no Ace, so we are behind any Ace. Potential: could improve on turn/river to a set (unlikely) or two pair if a 9 appears (but board has no 9). Also could make straight with 7-8? Actually board 6- A -4, we have 9, need 7-8 for straight? 6-7-8-9-10? Not possible because board has A, not 10. So no.\n\nThus hand is weak. Opponent likely continuation bet. We have 9s vs unknown range. Our stack 173, opponent 134. Pot 128, bet 50, we need to call 50 to see turn. Pot odds: call 50 to win 178 (128+50). So odds 50/178 \u2248 28% required. Our hand equity vs typical continuation range? Probably less than 20%. So fold.\n\nBut consider opponent may be weak, maybe we could raise as bluff? Our hand is not strong, but we could represent a strong hand like A or set. However raising to 100 minimum raise is possible. But we have 43 BB, still decent stack. However opponent has 134 chips, shortish. A raise could push them off and win pot. But risk: if they call, we are likely behind. Could be a good bluff if opponent is tight and folds to raise. But we have no blockers to A; they have A on board, could have Ace. Our 9s not blockers. So maybe not good.\n\nGiven we are out of position (BB vs Seat1 maybe in early position? Seat1 is UTG? Not sure). Usually with pocket pair low on board with overcards, you fold to c-bet.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Actually SB posted 2, BB posted 4, then MiniMax raised to 8, meaning they put in 8 total, which is 4 extra over BB). So amount to call is 6 (to match 8). Minimum raise to 12.\n\nWe need decide fold/call/raise. With Td2s, a weak hand, especially out of position (SB vs UTG? Actually seat 4 is CO? Let's see positions: Seat 1 is BB? Actually blinds: SB seat5, BB seat1. So seat4 is UTG? Table: seats 1-8, seat1 BB, seat2 maybe UTG? Actually seat numbers: seat1 BB, seat2 maybe UTG (but folded), seat3 maybe MP (folded), seat4 maybe CO (still in). So MiniMax-M2 is in CO (cutoff) raising. We have a weak hand, short stack 41.8 BB, but still decent. Should we consider calling? Call would be 6 chips, pot becomes 14+6=20? Actually pot currently 14 (SB 2 + BB 4). MiniMax raise adds 8 total, so pot now 14 + 8? Wait the raise is 8 total, meaning they put 8 chips (including 4 blind?), they posted 4 as BB, then raise to 8, adding 4 more? Actually preflop: seat5 post_sb 2, seat1 post_bb 4, seat4 raise 8. So raise amount is 8 total, not additional. So they added 4 extra (8-4). So pot now 2+8+4? Actually seat5 posted 2, seat1 posted 4, seat4 put 8, total 14. That's the pot before our decision. To call, we need to put 6 more to match 8 (since we already posted 2). So after calling, pot would be 20. Our stack would be 161 chips left.\n\nGiven hand strength, calling is not advisable. Fold is typical. Could we raise? Not with such weak hand. So fold.\n\nBut consider tournament: we have 41.8 BB, decent stack, but we don't want to waste chips on trash. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON.",

We have K high, pair of Kings, plus a gutshot? Not really. We have K kicker: King pair, kicker 5. Opponent (Seat2) is BB, checked flop. He is 154 chips, we have 163 chips. Both have similar stacks. He checked, we can check or bet/raise. What is his likely range? He is BB, preflop he just called 4 (big blind) and checked flop. He could have a variety: maybe mid pairs, draws, etc. Board is spade heavy; he may have spade draws. Our hand is decent but vulnerable to overpairs (AQ, AK, etc) but we have K of hearts, not spades. Could be top pair but not strong. We could check to see a turn, but also could bet to protect against draws and get value from worse hands (like weaker K, Q, J, etc). Pot is 10, we have 163 chips, min raise 4. Betting 4 (size of BB) is small, but could be okay.\n\nGiven tournament, medium stack, need to preserve chips but also pick up chips. Opponent's tendencies: from recall, he has raised preflop with 6 chips (hand 16,17) and 12 chips (hand22). He also bet on flop 6 chips (hand20). So he can be aggressive. He also called a 2 chip preflop (hand20). He seems to be willing to bet 6 on flop. So if we bet, he might raise? Hard.\n\nWe have top pair but no kicker advantage vs many. Might consider checking and seeing turn. If turn is a spade, we could be in trouble. If turn is a non-spade, we still have top pair.\n\nThus checking is safe. But we could also bet around 4-6 to protect. Since min raise is 4, raising to 8 would be a raise of 8 total? Actually raise_to total. So we could raise to 8 (i.e., bet 8). That would be 2x pot? Pot 10, bet 8 is less than pot. Might be okay.\n\nGiven opponent checked, maybe they have weak hand and will call a bet. We could extract value.

We have K high, pair of Kings, plus a gutshot? Not really. We have K kicker: King pair, kicker 5. Opponent (Seat2) is BB, checked flop. He is 154 chips, we have 163 chips. Both have similar stacks. He checked, we can check or bet/raise. What is his likely range? He is BB, preflop he just called 4 (big blind) and checked flop. He could have a variety: maybe mid pairs, draws, etc. Board is spade heavy; he may have spade draws. Our hand is decent but vulnerable to overpairs (AQ, AK, etc) but we have K of hearts, not spades. Could be top pair but not strong. We could check to see a turn, but also could bet to protect against draws and get value from worse hands (like weaker K, Q, J, etc). Pot is 10, we have 163 chips, min raise 4. Betting 4 (size of BB) is small, but could be okay.\n\nGiven tournament, medium stack, need to preserve chips but also pick up chips. Opponent's tendencies: from recall, he has raised preflop with 6 chips (hand 16,17) and 12 chips (hand22). He also bet on flop 6 chips (hand20). So he can be aggressive. He also called a 2 chip preflop (hand20). He seems to be willing to bet 6 on flop. So if we bet, he might raise? Hard.\n\nWe have top pair but no kicker advantage vs many. Might consider checking and seeing turn. If turn is a spade, we could be in trouble. If turn is a non-spade, we still have top pair.\n\nThus checking is safe. But we could also bet around 4-6 to protect. Since min raise is 4, raising to 8 would be a raise of 8 total? Actually raise_to total. So we could raise to 8 (i.e., bet 8). That would be 2x pot? Pot 10, bet 8 is less than pot. Might be okay.\n\nGiven opponent checked, maybe they have weak hand and will call a bet. We could extract value. But also risk being raised if he has a stronger hand like AK (but we have K hearts, not spade). He could have K spade? Actually board K spade, we have K hearts, opponent could have K spade (but board already has K spade). So opponent could have K with a spade kicker?

So any spade lower than K gives them a flush, but not nut? The nut flush would be Ace of spades, which beats any other spade. So opponent could have A\u2660 for nut flush.

If they have Kx they'd have trips K? Actually board has one K, so they could have Kx for pair of Kings (we have same). They could have 8x for trips 8s (but board has two 8s, they need third 8 for trips). There is only one 8 left (8c on board). Actually board has 8s and 8c, that's two 8s. So they could have 8d? Actually there are three 8s total? No, deck has four suits, we have 8s and 8c on board, so remaining 8h and 8d are possible. If they have an 8, they'd have trips (three of a kind). Could also have a straight? Board: K 2 8 6 8. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9? Not possible. 4-5-6-7-8? No 7 missing. So no straight.\n\nFlush: board has four spades (Ks, 2s, 8s, 6s). Actually that's four spades, plus 8c. So any spade in hand gives a flush. We have Kh 5h, no spade. Opponent could have a spade for flush. They checked river, maybe they missed flush draw. Could have a lower flush but they'd likely bet. They could have a full house: K K 8 8 8? Not possible because only one K left (Kc, Kd). If they have Kc they'd have two pair K K and 8 8?

Not possible.\n\nSo our hand is top pair K with weak kicker, but board is very coordinated flush heavy. Opponent checked, likely they have nothing. We could check and win. Raising may be a bluff, but opponent might call with a weak hand? They checked all streets, likely they have nothing, maybe a missed draw, maybe a weak pair like 2-2,6-6, etc. Could they have a hand like 8h (makes trips)? If they have 8h they'd have trips, they'd likely bet river. So they probably don't have 8. Could they have Kx? They might have Kc, they'd have two pair (K's and 8's). They might check? Usually they'd bet. So likely they have nothing. So we can check and win. But we could also consider a value bet? But we have only top pair K, not strong vs potential flush. If we bet, they might call with any pair (like 2-2,6-6,8-8? but they'd have 8 they'd bet). Could they call with a lower pair? Maybe they have 6-6 or 2-2, they'd call? They might fold to a bet.

Typically 7-8 suited UTG is a fold in tournament early position unless deep stacks and aggressive. Stack 43 BB, not super deep but okay. Against 2 players (SB and BB). The SB posted 2, BB posted 4. Amount to call 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total). Considering hand strength: 7-8 suited is a speculative hand, can see flop cheap if multi-way, but UTG raise may get folded often. Call 4 is cheap, but you'll be out of position post-flop. With 43 BB, you could limp? But legal actions are fold/call/raise, not check. So you could call 4, see flop, but out of position. Might be okay to limp and see flop cheaply, but risk being raised. Many players would fold UTG 7-8 suited. I'd likely fold, preserving stack for better spots. Let's consider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) has raised preflop with amounts 18,6,12 in prior hands. That suggests they sometimes raise small (6) maybe from early position? Not sure. MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) posted BB, unknown. Could be tight. I'd fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #34 preflop. Position: BB. Our hand Ks5d (king of spades, five of diamonds). Stack 171 chips. Blinds 2/4. Pot 16 (SB+BB+calls?). Actions: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, others folded, BB called 2 (so we just called SB), then Seat1 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (i.e., 12 total, so raise of 8 over our 4? Actually amount to call is 8, min raise to 20). So we face a raise to 12, we need to call 8 more (to match 12). Opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking is seat1, presumably UTG? Actually seat1 is maybe dealer? But irrelevant.\n\nWe need to decide fold, call, raise. Hand Ks5 offsuit. In BB vs a raise from opponent (likely early position?), we need to consider stack depth 42.8 BB, raise to 12 is 3BB (since big blind 4). That's 3BB raise. So pot after raise: 4 (BB) + 2 (SB) + 2 (call) + 12 (raise) = 20? Actually we have called 2 to match SB, so we have 4 (BB) + 2 (SB) + 2 (our call) = 8 in pot before raise. Then opponent raises to 12, adding 8 more, pot becomes 16? Wait original pot listed 16 before raise? The hand info says Pot: 16 chips before actions? Actually they list pot after blinds posted maybe 6? Not sure. Anyway.\n\nKs5 is a weak hand. In BB, against a raise, typical folding range is wide. Ks5 offsuit is not a strong hand; it's a king but weak kicker. Could consider calling if opponent is very loose and raise size small, but 3BB raise is standard. With 42 BB stack, calling would be about 2 BB effective, giving us ~5:1 pot odds? Let's compute: To call 8 chips, pot currently (including opponent's raise?) Let's compute after raise: pot = BB 4 + SB 2 + our call 2 + opponent raise 12 = 20. To call 8 more, total pot after call would be 20 + 8 = 28. So pot odds = 8 / 28 = 0.285, about 28.5% needed. Our hand equity vs random? Ks5 offsuit vs unknown range maybe ~15%? Not enough. So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: recall shows they raised 12 (3BB) in hand 21, also raised 8 earlier (2BB) and 36 (9BB). So they vary. But not extremely tight. So folding is safe.\n\nThus output JSON with fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have flop 5c 9c 6d. Our hand Ad 3d gives us a flush draw (diamonds) with Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Board: 5-6-9, we have 3, so open-ended? Actually we have 3, need 4-5-6-7-8? We have 3, board 5-6-9, we could make a straight with 4-5-6-7? Not. We have 3, need 4-5-6-7? Not possible. So only flush draw. Also we have Ace high, maybe a pair of Aces on board? No Aces on board.\n\nWe are on BTN, after flop seat 1 (SB) bet 8 into pot 28, seat2 (BB) called 8, now it's our turn. Stack 167, pot currently 28 + 8+8 =44? Actually pot before bet: 28. SB bet 8 => pot 36, BB called 8 => pot 44, we need call 8. Minimum raise to 16 (so raise to 16 total? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in, so raise to 16 means add 8 more? Wait min raise to: 16 means total bet after raise is 16, which is 8 more than current bet of 8? Actually current bet is 8, so raise to 16 means add 8 more. So raise amount 8.\n\nOur hand: Ace-high flush draw (9 outs? Actually diamonds: we have Ad, 3d. Board diamonds: none. So 13-2 =11 diamonds left. But Ace already in hand, so remaining diamonds 11. But two of those are the 3d? Actually we have 3d, so remaining diamonds are 11 (including Ace? No Ace we have). So 11 outs. Pot odds: call 8 to win 44+8 =52? Actually if we call 8, pot becomes 52, we need to call 8, so odds = 8/(52) = 15.4% required. Flush draw equity ~ (11 outs * 2) = 22% on turn+river, but we only have two streets left. Approx probability to hit flush by river = 1 - ((45/47)*(44/46)) ~? Let's compute: after flop, deck 52-3 board -2 hand =47 cards unknown. Probability hit flush by river = 1 - ( (47-11)/47 * (46-11)/46 ) = 1 - (36/47 * 35/46) = 1 - (0.766 * 0.761) = 1 - 0.583 = 0.417 ~41.7%. So call is profitable. Also we have Ace high, could win if opponent doesn't have better. Opponent likely has a pair or draws. Their bet size is small 8 into 28 (pot 28). Could be a continuation bet with many hands.\n\nWe could also raise to protect and build pot. But our stack is 167, we have room. Minimum raise to 16 is small. Raising may fold out some draws but also increase pot. With 41% equity, raising to 16 (adding 8) yields pot after raise: we add 8, pot becomes 60? Actually currently pot 44, we raise to 16 (so we put in total 16, which includes the 8 call + 8 extra). So we add extra 8, making pot 52 (call) +8 =60? Wait: after SB bet 8, BB called 8, pot 44. If we raise to 16, we need to put in 16 total (i.e., 8 call + 8 raise). So we add 8 more, making pot 44+16 =60. Opponent then can call 8 more (to match 16). So we are building pot.\n\nGiven we have good equity, raising is okay. But also consider position: we are last to act, we could just call to see turn cheap. Opponent's bet is small, maybe they are weak. Raising could scare them away and we win pot uncontested. But we want chips, not necessarily to win small pot.\n\nGiven tournament, stack 41.8 BB, not huge but decent. I think call is fine.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. I'd call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Board has two clubs, one diamond (6d) and a king diamond? Wait board: 5c 9c 6d Kd. That's clubs clubs diamond diamond. So we have two diamonds, board has two diamonds? Actually 6d and Kd are diamonds, yes. So we have four diamonds total: Ad, 3d, 6d, Kd. That's a flush draw? Need 5 diamonds. We have two in hand, two on board, need one more diamond on river. So we have a backdoor flush draw? Actually we have a flush draw already? No, need 5 of same suit. We have 4 diamonds currently, need one more diamond on river for flush. So we have a gutshot? Not exactly. We have Ace high, plus a gutshot straight? Board 5-9-6-K, we have A3, possible straight draw? 3-? Not. So currently our hand is Ace high (Ad) with a flush draw (four to a flush). Also we have a pair? No. So we have decent draw.\n\nOpponents: Seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) and Seat2 (Kimi-K2) both have stacks 248 and 146. Preflop: Seat5 (us) called BB, seat1 called sb, seat2 checked. Flop: seat1 bet 8 into pot 10? Actually pot 10? Preflop pot: 2+4+4+2 =12? Wait: blinds 2+4 =6, plus our call 4 =10, seat1 call 2 =12. So pot 12 preflop. Flop bet 8 from seat1, seat2 call 8, seat5 call 8. So pot after flop: 12 + 8*3 = 36, matches given.\n\nTurn: seat1 check, seat2 check. So both checked to us. Amount to call 0, we can check or raise. Minimum raise 8, legal actions fold, check, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on opponent tendencies. We can recall opponent actions.

          "reasoning_content": "We have some data: Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat1) has bet on turn in recent hands (10). No data for Kimi-K2 (seat2). So seat1 tends to bet on turn. In this hand they checked, maybe they have a weak hand or trap.\n\nOur hand: Ace high with flush draw. Turn card unknown? The turn card is Kd? Actually board: 5c 9c 6d Kd. That's the turn? Wait board shows 4 cards, so turn is Kd. So turn is a king of diamonds, giving us four diamonds and also a paired king on board (pair of kings). So board now: 5c 9c 6d Kd (king of diamonds). Actually we have Kd on board, we have no king. So there is a pair of kings on board? Only one king on board. So currently no pair on board except Kd. So we have Ace high.\n\nPotential opponent holdings: Could have king, could have flush draw, could have straight draw, could have pair like 9, 5, 6, etc.\n\nWe are in position, both opponents checked. We could check and see river, or we could raise to apply pressure, maybe represent a king or a flush draw, or a strong hand.\n\nStack sizes: We have 159 chips, pot 36. Effective stack for us vs each opponent: seat1 248, seat2 146. So we are short relative to seat1 but bigger than seat2. Raising to 8 minimum would be small, maybe raise to 12? Minimum raise is 8 (to total 8?). Actually current bet is 0, so raise to at least 8 chips. That would be a small raise, about 0.22 BB? Actually 8 chips is 2 BB (since BB 4). So raise to 8 is 2 BB.\n\nWe could raise to 8 (just meet minimum) as a continuation bet to try to steal pot. Since we have a draw, we might want to get value if they call with worse hands.\n\nConsider pot odds: If we call a bet on river (if we raise now and they call) we need to think about equity. But maybe we want to bet now to protect against draws? Opponents may have flush draws? Actually board has two diamonds, they could have two diamonds for flush draw (needs two more diamonds). They could have Ace of diamonds? We have Ace of diamonds, so they cannot have Ace of diamonds. They could have 2d,4d,7d,8d,10d,Jd,Qd for flush draw. So they could have flush draws.\n\nRaising now could be good to charge draws.\n\nGiven opponent seat1 has a tendency to bet on turn, but they checked this time, maybe they have a weak hand and are checking to see. We could raise to apply pressure. Seat2 unknown.\n\nI think raising to 12 (total) would be decent. But min raise is 8, we could raise to 12 to make it a bit bigger.\n\nCheck? If we check, we give free river to opponents. If they have a pair like K, they could bet. Might be okay.\n\nGiven we have decent draw and some equity, I think a small raise is good to protect and get value. So action: raise to 12.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

Also we have overcards Q and T. Opponent(s) on flop: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) checked. Seat 1 called preflop and is still in? Actually seat 1 called preflop, but we have only seat 2's action listed; maybe seat 1 is also in but hasn't acted yet? The flop actions list only Seat 2 check. Probably seat 1 is next to act, but not listed? The legal actions are for us (BB). The pot is 40 chips. Our stack 183. We are first to act? Actually seat order: after flop, action starts with UTG? The flop order is from left of button? In BB, after flop, the first to act is UTG (Seat 1 maybe). But seat 2 checked, maybe seat 1 already acted? Actually seat 2 is Kimi-K2, seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (maybe same player). The seat numbers: seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking - 236 chips (maybe the player is thinking). seat2 is Kimi-K2 - 134 chips. So seat1 is the one who called preflop (call 12). seat2 is SB who posted 2 and called preflop. So flop order: first to act is seat1 (UTG?), then seat2, then us (BB). But seat2 check is listed, meaning seat1 must have acted before seat2. But not shown. Possibly seat1 checked as well, but not listed. The legal actions for us: fold, check, raise. So we can check or raise.\n\nOur hand: Th Qd. Board: 4d 2d 4h. We have backdoor flush draw (needs two more diamonds). Also we have gutshot? Not really. Pair of 4s on board; we have no pair. Potential for overpair? No. So hand is weak. However opponent may have a hand like 44 (full house), or a set of 2? Actually board has pair of 4s; possible opponent could have 4x for set, or a 2 for trips? Actually only one 2 on board, so 2x would be two pair? If opponent holds 2? they'd have two pair (2s and 4s). Or could have flush draw with diamonds. Could have straight draws? Board 4-2-4, not many.\n\nOur best line likely is to check and see a turn, maybe try a small raise if we think opponent is weak? But we have only backdoor draws; not strong enough to raise. Checking is safe.\n\nConsider stack sizes: opponent seat2 has 134 chips, seat1 has 236. Our stack 183. Pot 40. If we check and opponent bets later, we can decide.\n\nThus choose check.\n\nWe must output JSON with action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

UTG is early position, pocket pairs are decent but 8s are medium. Need to consider opponent tendencies: seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raises sometimes small (6,12) and larger (18). Not huge aggression. Also seat4 (MiniMax-M2) posted BB, but hasn't acted yet. The action: we are UTG, after SB and BB posted, it's our turn to act. Amount to call is 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have 8-8. In early position, typical raise to 2.5-3 BB (8-12). With 45 BB, can raise. Should we raise? Consider tournament stage: stack 45 BB, still decent. Raising is standard. Potential opponents: seat3 (DeepSeek) maybe raises later, but they are later seats. If we raise, we might get 3-bet later. But 8-8 is decent for a raise.\n\nCheck: not allowed because amount to call is 4 (a bet). So we must fold, call, or raise.\n\nCall: just call 4, see flop out of position. Not ideal with medium pair UTG.\n\nRaise: standard. Could raise to 12 (3 BB) or minimum 8 (2 BB). Minimum raise is 8 total (i.e., 4 to call + 4 extra). That is 2 BB. Usually raise to 3 BB (12). But we must ensure it's legal: raise to any amount >= min raise and <= stack. So we can raise to 12.\n\nGiven we have 45 BB, raising to 12 is fine. Reason: we want to thin the field and build pot with a decent pair. Also we have no reads that opponents are tight; they have raised small amounts previously.\n\nThus action: raise to 12.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

If opponent has T?, they'd have set of tens. If they have 8?, they'd have full house? Actually board has no 8s, so they'd have pair of 8s with board pair 3s => they'd have two pair (8s and 3s). Not full house. To have full house they'd need a combination like 3 and 10? That would give them full house 3s over tens? Wait full house is three of a kind plus a pair.

Set of tens beats us (tens > eights). Also opponent could have 8 and something else gives them full house? 8 and 3 gives full house 8s over 3s (we have trips 8s, they'd have full house 8s over 3s, which beats us). Similarly 8 and T gives full house 8s over Ts, beats us. Also opponent could have pocket pair like 33 or TT gives them full house? Let's see: 33 + board 3c Td 3d gives them quads? Actually board has two 3s, they have two 3s, that is four of a kind (quads). That's even stronger. TT gives them full house Ts over 3s (since board has pair 3s).

With set of 8s, but board is paired, many combos beat us. Opponent checked, could be weak or could be trap. Our stack is 171 chips, pot 40, we have 8s, we could consider raising to protect against draws? There are no straight/flush draws? Board: 3c Td 3d, no flush draw (two clubs, two diamonds). Straight draw? Need 4-5-6-7? Not possible. So only combos that beat us are made hands. Since opponent checked, they may have weak hand like a draw (none) or a middle pair, but could also be slow playing a strong hand. Raising could extract value from worse hands (e.g., a single 8, a 3, a T, etc.) but also risk being called by stronger full house combos.\n\nGiven stack size moderate, tournament stage unknown. Probably we want to bet for value. Minimum raise is 8, to 48 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Current pot 40, we have not contributed on flop. If we raise to 48, we add 48 chips. That would be a small raise, maybe we can raise to 60? Minimum raise to 8 means raise total to 8? Actually raise_to is total amount you're putting in, not additional. Since amount to call is 0, raise_to would be the bet size. Minimum raise is 8, so raise_to must be at least 8. So we could raise to 48? Wait typical: raise_to is total bet amount, not total stack. Since no bet, raise_to is the amount we bet. Minimum raise is 8 chips, so we must bet at least 8. So raise_to=8 is allowed (bet 8). That is 1/5 pot. Might be too small. Could raise to 20 (half pot) or 30. We need to decide.\n\nGiven opponent likely has a range of many combos, betting for value is good. I'd raise to 30 (total bet 30) to get value from weaker hands.

But is that wise? Likely not. We could call 50, see turn. But calling may be losing if opponent has set. Turn card unknown. Pot odds: call 50 to win pot of 260+50? Actually current pot before call is 150+30+80 =260. If we call 50, we invest 50 for pot 260, equity needed ~16.3%. Our hand vs opponent's range: maybe opponent has set (33) ~ 3 outs to improve? Actually we have 8s, we could improve to set of eights (if 8 appears). There are two eights left in deck. Turn + river: 2 cards, chance to hit at least one 8 = 1 - (45/47)*(44/46) \u2248 1 - (0.9574)*(0.9565) = 1 - 0.915 \u2248 0.085 = 8.5% chance to make set, plus maybe two pair? If turn is a Ten, we get two pair (T8) but board has T, so we would have pair of tens? Actually we have 8s, board T,3,3. If turn is Ten, we have two pair tens and threes? Actually we would have pair of tens (board Ten plus turn Ten) and pair of threes, but we only have one ten, board already has ten, so we would have two tens? Wait we have no ten. If turn is Ten, board becomes T T 3 3, we have pair of tens (board) and pair of threes (board). That's two pair, but opponent may have better. So not great. So equity low. So calling is not profitable.\n\nThus best to fold. However we could consider raising all-in as a bluff? But our stack is 141, raising to 130 would be a big bluff. Opponent likely has strong hand; bluff may not work. Better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Actually we are button, but after 3-bet and a call, we will be in position post-flop. Still 9-7 offsuit is a speculative hand, not great for 3-bet. We raised preflop to 8 (2.5x BB) which is a standard open. Then got 3-bet to 16 (4x BB). Our 9-7 offsuit is not a 3-bet candidate; we should probably fold.\n\nWe could consider calling to see flop, but with 31.8 BB stack, calling 8 would be cheap. But 9-7 offsuit has low equity vs typical 3-bet range (likely strong). Might be a fold.\n\nWe could also raise (4-bet) all-in? Minimum raise to 24, which is still small relative to stack; but 4-betting with 9-7 offsuit is not advisable.\n\nThus best action: fold.\n\nWe should give reasoning.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

So pot is 80 chips (as given). Amount to call is 16 (to match 24). Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise total to 40). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: K5 offsuit in BB facing a 3x raise from UTG? Actually seat2 likely early position (maybe UTG). Stack is short (15 BB). K5 offsuit is weak. Opponent raise size moderate. Others called. So likely we should fold. But maybe we could call to see flop with decent implied odds? K5 offsuit is not great. At 15 BB, we want to preserve chips. Also we have 5h and Ks, not suited. Potential to make top pair K, but many players in hand. I think fold.\n\nWe could also consider opponent's raise tendencies: Kimi-K2 raise amounts historically 6,20,6,6,12,12. So they sometimes raise small (3bb) and sometimes larger (20). Here raise is 24 (3x BB). That's typical. Not a huge raise. But still, K5 is weak.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

So we are SB after posting, we have option to call 4 (to match big blind 8? Actually amount to call is 4 because BB is 8, we already posted 4, so need to add 4 more to match 8). Minimum raise to 16 means raise total to 16 (i.e., raise 8 more). Hand 6c8c is weak suited connector, low. Stack 115 chips (14.4 BB). In early stage? We have 14 BB, shortish. Should we fold? Likely fold. Opponent MiniMax called BB, could be wide but unknown. 6c8c is not strong enough to play from SB vs BB raise? Actually it's just a call to BB, not raise. So we can call 4 to see flop. But with 14 BB, maybe we can limp? But we are out of position after flop, SB is first to act preflop? Actually after blinds, action is on UTG (seat2) then seat3 then seat4 then seat5 (SB). So SB is last to act preflop, so can call. However hand is weak. Should we fold to avoid playing out of position? Usually 6c8c is a marginal hand, could be played in SB if effective stack small? 14 BB is moderate. Might be better to fold and preserve chips.\n\nConsider tournament stage? Not given.

With a short stack (14.4 BB) we want to apply pressure and avoid playing out of position. Raising to 3 BB (24 chips) maximizes fold equity against the SB and BB, who have shown modest preflop aggression, and gives us a good chance to win the blinds outright.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have hand: BTN with As Ts (Ace high, suited? Actually As Ts: Ace of spades, Ten of spades, both spades, so suited Ace-Ten). Stack 115 chips, 14.4 BB (big blind 8). Preflop, SB posted 4, BB posted 8. So pot 12. Action: we are BTN, after SB and BB posted, it's our turn. Amount to call 8 (big blind). Minimum raise to 16 (so raise amount total 16). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: Seat 1 (SB) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 173. Their raise amounts preflop: 12, 36, 12, 16, 24. So they raise various amounts, sometimes 12 (3BB), 16 (2BB?), Actually big blind 8, so 12 is 1.5 BB, 16 is 2 BB, 24 is 3 BB, 36 is 4.5 BB. They seem to raise small to moderate, maybe open-raise? But they are in SB, they posted 4, they can raise. Their raise amounts show they are not just limp; they raise sometimes bigger. Not enough info.\n\nSeat 2 (BB) is Kimi-K2, stack 240. Their raises preflop: 6,6,12,12,24. So they raise 6 (0.75 BB) which is weird maybe a limp? Actually raise to 6 would be raise 6? Wait amount is maybe total? They posted 8 BB, so raise to 6 is less than posted? That seems odd. Might be they called? The data may be inconsistent. But they raise sometimes 12 (1.5 BB), 24 (3 BB). So BB sometimes raises.\n\nNow we have AsTs suited. In BTN, with short stack (14.4 BB) but still enough to raise. Typically we could open raise to 2.5-3 BB (20-24). Since we have decent hand, we could raise to 24 (3 BB) to isolate. Or we could call (just see flop) but with 14 BB maybe want to steal blinds. AsTs is a good hand for steal, suited Ace with decent equity.\n\nBut we need to consider opponent tendencies: SB may raise occasionally; if they raise, we would respond accordingly. But they haven't acted yet; it's our turn. They posted 4; they could raise after us? Actually order: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, then BTN acts. If we raise, SB and BB will act after us. If we call (just match BB), then SB and BB can act (SB could raise or check; BB could check). Usually in BTN you want to raise to steal.\n\nGiven stack sizes: SB 173 (15 BB?), BB 240 (30 BB). Our stack is shortest. So raising may isolate us vs BB or SB. If they both call, pot will be 12 + 8 + raise? Actually if we raise to 16 total (2 BB), then SB must call 12 more (since they posted 4), BB must call 8 more (since posted 8). That would be okay.\n\nBut we need to consider risk: AsTs suited is good but not premium. With short stack, if we get 3-bet, we may be in trouble. However, there is no raise yet; we are first to act.\n\nThus best action: raise to maybe 24 (3 BB) to apply pressure. But minimum raise is 16. We could raise to 24, which is 3 BB. Is that within our stack? Yes we have 115 chips, raising to 24 leaves 91 chips behind.\n\nConsider pot odds: If we call (8) pot becomes 20, we risk 8 to see flop. AsTs suited has about 30% equity vs random. Might be okay but we might be out of position post-flop (SB and BB act before us). Better to raise.\n\nThus I will raise to 24.\n\nNow we need to produce JSON.",

Need to consider hand strength: Q7 suited is a marginal hand. In early position raise, likely a strong range (maybe 10%+). Q7s is weak, not a good call. Also stack is 16.4 BB, not huge but can call. However calling 12 into pot 32 gives pot odds ~ 12/(32+12) = 27% to win. Q7s vs unknown range maybe ~10% equity. Not good.\n\nWe could consider raising as a bluff? But with 16 BB stack, raising to 32 would be a 2x raise (from 20 to 32). Might be okay if we think opponent can fold.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #49 preflop. Position: BB (seat5). Our cards: 8d 9d, suited connectors, decent for a 15.9 BB stack. Blinds 4/8, we posted SB 4? Actually seat5 is BB, but actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4 (so they posted small blind? Wait seat5 is BB? They said Position: BB (Seat5). But actions: seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8. So seat5 is small blind, seat1 is big blind. So we are actually in SB, not BB. But they said Position: BB. Might be confusion: maybe seat5 is BB and seat1 is SB? Actually typical: SB posts half big blind, BB posts full. Here SB is 4, BB is 8. So seat5 posted SB 4, seat1 posted BB 8. So seat5 is SB, not BB. But they say Position: BB (Seat5). Might be mislabel. Regardless, we are first to act after the blind posting? After SB and BB posted, it's UTG etc but all others folded, so it's just us (SB) and BB. The action order: preflop: seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8, then seat2 fold, seat3 fold, seat4 fold. So now it's our turn (SB) to act facing a bet of 8 (BB). The amount to call is 4 (since we already have 4 in SB, need to call 4 more to match 8). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise total to 16). So legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nOur stack 127 chips, we have 15.9 BB (big blind is 8). So we have enough.\n\nWe have 8d9d, suited connectors. In SB vs BB heads-up, we can consider raising (3-bet) or just call. Need opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat1) is the BB. We have recall of opponent raises: they have raised preflop amounts varying. In previous hands, they raised 8 (which is just BB), 12, 36, 12, 16, 24. Not clear if they are aggressive. But they have been raising preflop (maybe 3-betting?) Actually those are their actions as the BB when they raise? In heads-up, they may raise as BB (i.e., they open-raise). But here they posted BB 8, not raise. So we are facing a standard BB bet (just posting). So opponent hasn't raised. So we can consider raising with suited connectors to take initiative, especially with stack ~16 BB. In heads-up, 8d9d is a decent hand to raise and try to steal the blind. However we are in SB with 8d9d, we have 4 in, need 4 to call. If we raise to 16 total, that's a raise of 8 more (since call would be 8 total). Actually raise total to 16 means we put 16 total into pot (including our 4 already?), raise amount = 12 more? Wait we have posted 4, need to call 4 to match 8, then raise to 16 total means we need to add 12 (since we already have 4). So raise amount = 12 chips. That's a 3-bet sized about 2x BB.\n\nGiven our stack, a raise to 16 is fine. Opponent's tendencies: they have raised preflop in earlier hands, sometimes big (36). Might be aggressive, could 3-bet call or re-raise. But they are also the BB, they might defend. In heads-up, they may defend a wide range. So raising could be good to take pot.\n\nAlternatively we could call and see flop. 8d9d is a drawing hand; but in heads-up, we want to be aggressive. If we call, we are in position (SB acts first preflop, then on flop we are out of position). Actually after flop, BB acts first. So being out of position is disadvantage. Raising gives us initiative and possibly win the pot preflop.\n\nGiven stack 15.9 BB, we could also consider all-in? Not needed.\n\nThus decision: raise to 16 (total). Reason: suited connectors, decent equity, want to steal, opponent likely defends but raise puts pressure.\n\nLet's answer.",

Past raises amounts: 18,6,12,14,20. Mostly small raises (6 is 0.75BB). The 24 raise is larger. Could be a strong hand. But we have a pocket pair; 9s is decent but vulnerable to overpairs. 3-betting could isolate and maybe win preflop. However stack is relatively shallow (16 BB). 3-bet to minimum raise 40 (5BB total). That would be 40 total, i.e., raise to 40, meaning we add 32 more (since 8 already posted). That would be a 2.5x raise over original 24 (so about 5BB). That's a decent size, could be considered a 3-bet.\n\nGiven our stack, 9-9 is decent to call and see flop. But raising could take down pot or give us initiative. Opponent may be raising wide; we have a decent hand. 3-bet could be profitable if opponent folds enough. However if they call, we may be in a multi-way? Actually only two players left: us and DeepSeek. So 3-bet would go heads-up. If they 4-bet, they'd be strong. Our stack can handle 3-bet.\n\nWe need to consider tournament dynamics: 16 BB is not huge but not too short. Preserving chips is important but we also can risk.\n\nGiven we have a pair, calling is safe. But raising could gain extra value if they call with worse (like lower pairs, suited connectors). 9-9 vs typical UTG range: likely overpairs (TT+, AK, AQ). So 9-9 may be behind. So maybe better to just call and see flop, not risk bigger pot.\n\nThus I think call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. We'll call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

So we have middle pair (9s) no straight draws (board shows Q K T, we have 9, so we have open-ended straight draw? Actually we have 9, board: Q K T, we need J to make straight (J9?). Wait straight combos: 9-10-J-Q-K is a straight, we have 9, board has T, Q, K, missing J and maybe also? Actually need J and maybe also? The board has Q K T. To have a straight, we need J and maybe also? The sequence: 9-10-J-Q-K. We have 9 and board has 10 and Q K, missing J. So we have a gutshot? Let's see: we have 9, board T, Q, K. The straight would be 9-10-J-Q-K, we need J. That's a gutshot (one card). Also we have a pair of 9s, which is low relative to board high cards. Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised preflop to 24 (3bb) from UTG? Actually seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2, they raised to 24 (3bb). We called with 9s. So they likely have a range of strong hands: broadways, AK, AQ, KQ, maybe suited connectors, etc. On flop Q K T, board is very coordinated, likely they have strong hand or draws. Our 9 pair is low. We have some equity if opponent has a straight draw (Jx) or maybe a set (unlikely), but they could have QJ, KJ, JT, etc. Also they could have A Q? Actually A Q would have top pair Q with Ace kicker, but board Q K T, they have Q? Not sure.\n\nWe need to know opponent's tendencies: recall opponent actions on flop: they have bet 20 (hand 2), bet 2 (hand 18), bet 40 (hand 43). So they sometimes bet small (2) maybe as probe, sometimes large. No pattern.\n\nOur stack is 115 chips, pot 52, we are BB with 14.4 BB. Minimum raise is 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total? Actually raise to total amount: minimum raise to 16 (meaning total bet 16? Actually we are facing amount to call 0, so we can bet/raise. Minimum raise to 16 means we need to bet at least 16 chips (i.e., raise to 16). So we can bet 16 or more. Our stack 115, we could go all-in.\n\nGiven we have a weak hand relative to board, we likely want to check (fold to bet). But we have a gutshot and pair, maybe we could consider a check-raise if we think opponent is bluffing. But opponent's raise preflop indicates strength. On flop they could continuation bet (c-bet) with many hands. The board is Q K T, they might have Qx, Kx, AK, AQ, etc. Our 9s is not strong. We may want to check and possibly fold to a bet. But we can also consider a small raise to try to take pot? Unlikely.\n\nThus best action: check. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call 0, we can check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Actually we need J to complete straight: 9-10-J-Q-K = straight, we need J. Also we have 8 to make 8-9-10-J-Q? Not on board. So only gutshot: need J for straight. Also we have a pair of 9s, currently not a made hand (no pair on board). So we have overpair to board? Board has Q K T, so 9 is lower than all.

Wait we started with 115 stack before posting BB? Actually \"Your Stack: 115 chips (14.4 BB)\" after posting BB? Usually stack includes blind posted. So we have 115 total chips, with 8 already posted. So remaining effective stack is 115 - 8 = 107? But we also called 16 preflop, so after call we have 115 - 8 - 16 = 91 chips left. Actually the stack listed is before any actions? Usually it's current stack before hand. After posting BB, you have 115-8 = 107 left to act. Then you called 16, leaving 91. Pot is 87 now (including our call). Opponent bet 35, we need to call 35 to see turn. Our remaining stack after call would be 91-35 = 56 chips, which is about 7 BB.

Actually pot before bet is 87, opponent bet 35 making pot 122. To call 35, we need 35/ (122) = 28.7% required equity. Our equity maybe around 20% so not profitable. Could raise? Minimum raise to 70 (i.e., raise total to 70). That would be raise of 35 more (since bet 35). That would be a 70 total bet, meaning we put 70 chips in. Our stack left after raise would be 91-70 = 21 chips (still have some). That would be a semi-bluff maybe? But we have low equity, and raising could force fold from many hands, but also could get called by better hands, losing more chips.

Wait: seat5 is BB (us). Seat1 posted SB 4, seat1 posted BB 8? Actually they listed seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8. So seat5 is SB? But they said position BB seat5. Might be reversed: seat5 is BB (we are BB). Seat1 is SB? Actually they posted SB 4 (seat5) then post_bb 8 (seat1). So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But they say our position BB seat5. Might be a mistake. Anyway we are in blind, facing a raise? No, only blinds posted, no raises. Amount to call is 4 (to complete BB). Minimum raise to 16. So we can call 4 to see flop. Hand 6s Kd is moderate. In early position (BB) vs only one opponent (SB) who posted 4 and hasn't acted yet? Actually preflop order: SB posts 4, BB posts 8, then action goes to UTG etc but all folded, so now it's our turn? Actually after blinds, action goes to player left of BB (SB) first. SB posted 4, hasn't acted. But they are already posted SB, they can check or raise. But the actions listed: seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8, others fold. So now it's SB's turn (seat5) to act? But seat5 is us, we posted SB 4. Wait they said we are BB seat5, but they posted SB 4 for seat5. Something off. Probably seat5 is SB and seat1 is BB. But they say our position BB seat5. I think it's a mistake; we are the big blind (seat5) with 8 posted. The amount to call is 4 (to call SB's 4). So we need to call 4 to see flop. So we are in BB facing a bet of 4 from SB? Actually SB posted 4, which is a blind, not a bet. So we can check (call 0) and see flop for free? In standard rules, after blinds, action starts with player left of BB (SB) who can raise or check (if no raise). Since SB already posted blind, they can raise now. But they haven't acted yet. So it's SB's turn to act, not BB. However the system says amount to call is 4, meaning we need to call 4 to match SB's blind. So it's BB's turn to act after SB? That implies SB has raised to 4? Actually SB posted 4, which is less than BB 8, but SB's blind is 4. The BB posted 8. So the amount to call for BB is 0 (since BB already posted 8). So the amount to call 4 is weird.\n\nGiven the format, they treat us as having to call 4 to match the SB's blind. So we are SB? Let's ignore confusion; we have to decide between fold, call 4, raise to 16. Hand 6s Kd is not great. In blind vs single opponent, calling 4 is cheap. Stack 111, 13.9 BB, we can call. Raise? Might be too aggressive. So call.\n\nThus output: action call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Wait board has 6c, we have 6s, that's a pair, not set. Actually board has a 6c, we have 6s, so we have pair of sixes, but there is also a 6 on board, so we have two pair? No, board 4s 9c 6c, we have 6s Kd, so we have a pair of sixes (pair on board plus our six). That's just a pair, not two pair. No flush draw? Board has two clubs (4s, 9c, 6c) actually 4s is spade, 9c club, 6c club. So there are two clubs, we have 6s and Kd, no club, so we have a backdoor flush draw? Actually we have one spade and one diamond, no clubs. So we have 2 clubs on board, need two more clubs to make flush, not likely. Straight draw? Board 4-6-9, we have K,6. No open-ended. So hand is just a pair of sixes, not great.\n\nOpponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 165, they checked preflop (they are in BB? Wait seat1 is BB? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Wait blinds: SB is seat5 (post_sb 4), BB is seat1 (post_bb 8). So seat1 is BB, they checked after we called. So they have position? After flop, seat1 acted first? The actions show preflop: seat5 post_sb, seat1 post_bb, then seat5 call, seat1 check. So on flop, seat1 is first to act (since they are in BB, but after flop they act first). So now it's our turn (seat5). Amount to call 0, we can check or raise. Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total? Actually raise to 8 chips total, meaning bet 8). Pot is 16 chips.\n\nWe need to decide: check or raise. Our hand is weak. Opponent's tendencies: recall shows they sometimes check, sometimes bet 14 on flop (hand 44). They also called a bet of 7 on flop (hand 39). They also folded a flop after checking (hand 40). So mixed.\n\nGiven we have a marginal hand, maybe we should check and see if they bet, then decide. But also could consider a small raise to take pot? However with only 13.4 BB, we might want to preserve chips. Check seems safe.\n\nBut consider opponent's stack 165, we have 107. Pot 16. If we check and they bet, we can call maybe with pair? But could be overvalued. If they bet big, we might be behind. So better to check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

Board has two spades: 4s and 6c? Wait 6c is clubs. So only one spade on board (4s). Our hand has 6s, so we have a flush draw? Need 5 spades, we have one spade, board one spade, need three more spades among remaining two cards? Not possible. So no flush draw. Straight draw? Board: 4,9,6,Q. Our hand: 6, K. Could we have open-ended straight draw? Not really. We have pair sixes. Opponent is seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking, with 236 chips. Preflop: they posted BB 8, we called 4 (SB). Then flop check-check. So on turn, we have amount to call 0, min raise 8, legal: fold, check, raise. Opponent's turn action not yet shown. We need to decide our action now (we are seat 5, BB). The board turn card unknown? Actually board listed includes turn? The board is 4s 9c 6c Qd. That's four cards: flop (3) + turn (1). So turn is Qd. So after turn, it's our action before opponent? Order: Since we are BB (seat5) and opponent is seat1 (UTG? Actually seat1 is SB? Wait seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Preflop: seat5 post_sb 4 (small blind). seat1 post_bb 8 (big blind). So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. After flop, action order: SB first (seat5) then BB (seat1). So on turn, same order: SB acts first. So we act now, opponent will act after us.\n\nWe have top pair K kicker. Opponent's stack is larger. What is opponent's likely range? They checked flop, so maybe weak or medium. Turn is Qd, giving them potential queen high, maybe they have Qx. Could be they have queen, maybe they have a straight draw? Not many combos.\n\nWe have 13.4 BB, short stack. Pot is 16 chips. If we check, we give them free card (river). If they bet, we can decide.\n\nRaising: min raise to 8 total (so raise of 8). That would be a bet of 8 into 16 pot, making pot 24. That is about 33% of pot. Could be a value raise to get called by worse hands like lower pair, maybe also a bluff to protect.\n\nOur hand is decent but not strong. With short stack, we might want to protect against possible draws (like QJ for straight? Board: 4-9-6-Q, no straight draws). Could be opponent has a queen, they'd likely bet. If we check, they could bet.\n\nGiven short stack, we might want to go all-in? But min raise is 8, we could raise to our stack 107. Is that allowed? Yes we can raise to any amount >= min raise. So we could go all-in as a shove. But is that advisable? With top pair, we might be ahead of many hands, but also behind some like Qx, 9x, 4x, or sets (6c? Actually 6c is on board, set would be 6x). Opponent could have 6x for set. Also could have Qx for two pair Q6? Actually board has Q and 6, we have 6, so we have two pair? Wait board: 4s 9c 6c Qd. We have 6s, so we have pair of sixes (one from board, one from hand). That's just a pair, not two pair. Opponent could have Qx giving them top pair Q with kicker. That beats us. So raising all-in may be risky.\n\nBetter to check and see opponent's action. Since amount to call is 0, checking is safe. If opponent bets, we can call if amount is reasonable relative to pot and stack.\n\nThus I will check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. No call because amount 0.\n\nThus choose check.\n\n"

Could we have open-ended straight draw? Not really. We have pair sixes. Opponent is seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking, with 236 chips. Preflop: they posted BB 8, we called 4 (SB). Then flop check-check. So on turn, we have amount to call 0, min raise 8, legal: fold, check, raise. Opponent's turn action not yet shown. We need to decide our action now (we are seat 5, BB). The board turn card unknown? Actually board listed includes turn? The board is 4s 9c 6c Qd. That's four cards: flop (3) + turn (1). So turn is Qd. So after turn, it's our action before opponent? Order: Since we are BB (seat5) and opponent is seat1 (UTG? Actually seat1 is SB? Wait seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Preflop: seat5 post_sb 4 (small blind). seat1 post_bb 8 (big blind). So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. After flop, action order: SB first (seat5) then BB (seat1). So on turn, same order: SB acts first. So we act now, opponent will act after us.\n\nWe have top pair K kicker. Opponent's stack is larger. What is opponent's likely range? They checked flop, so maybe weak or medium. Turn is Qd, giving them potential queen high, maybe they have Qx. Could be they have queen, maybe they have a straight draw? Not many combos.\n\nWe have 13.4 BB, short stack. Pot is 16 chips. If we check, we give them free card (river). If they bet, we can decide.\n\nRaising: min raise to 8 total (so raise of 8). That would be a bet of 8 into 16 pot, making pot 24. That is about 33% of pot. Could be a value raise to get called by worse hands like lower pair, maybe also a bluff to protect.\n\nOur hand is decent but not strong. With short stack, we might want to protect against possible draws (like QJ for straight? Board: 4-9-6-Q, no straight draws). Could be opponent has a queen, they'd likely bet. If we check, they could bet.\n\nGiven short stack, we might want to go all-in? But min raise is 8, we could raise to our stack 107. Is that allowed? Yes we can raise to any amount >= min raise. So we could go all-in as a shove. But is that advisable? With top pair, we might be ahead of many hands, but also behind some like Qx, 9x, 4x, or sets (6c? Actually 6c is on board, set would be 6x). Opponent could have 6x for set. Also could have Qx for two pair Q6? Actually board has Q and 6, we have 6, so we have two pair? Wait board: 4s 9c 6c Qd. We have 6s, so we have pair of sixes (one from board, one from hand). That's just a pair, not two pair. Opponent could have Qx giving them top pair Q with kicker. That beats us. So raising all-in may be risky.\n\nBetter to check and see opponent's action. Since amount to call is 0, checking is safe. If opponent bets, we can call if amount is reasonable relative to pot and stack.\n\nThus I will check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. No call because amount 0.\n\nThus choose check.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have BTN with Ac7c, stack 107 chips (13.4 BB). Blinds 4/8, small blind posted by seat1 (4), big blind seat2 (8). So we are facing a big blind (8) and a small blind (4). The amount to call is 8 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Hand: Ace of clubs, 7 of clubs. Suited Ace, decent for button. Stack shallowish (13.4 BB). Consider push/fold? At 13 BB, many push/fold ranges. But we have ability to raise to 16 (i.e., 8 more). That's a small raise (2 BB). Could also call and see flop. Let's consider opponents tendencies: Seat1 (SB) has raised amounts 36,12,16,24,16 in previous hands. So they can be aggressive, sometimes large raises. Seat2 (BB) has raised 6,6,12,12,24 (i.e., sometimes small raises). However in this hand they have posted BB, not yet acted.\n\nWe are BTN. Our hand Ace-7 suited is decent for stealing blinds. At 13 BB, a raise to 16 (2 BB) is a standard raise to 2.5-3 BB from button. That's fine. But we also have a decent chance to be called by BB (who may defend). However BB's stack 228, larger. Their raise tendencies show they raise small amounts sometimes. Could they call? Likely they will call with a wide range. So raising may get called. But our hand may have decent equity vs typical BB defending range. Also we could just call 8, see flop cheap, but we risk being out of position after flop (we are still in position, actually we are still BTN after flop, still last to act). If we call, pot becomes 20 (12+8). With 107 stack, we still have 99 left. Could play postflop.\n\nGiven stack shallow, many players push all-in around 10 BB. Could consider going all-in (raise to 107). But legal raise min is 16; we could raise all-in. However that may be too much with Ace-7 suited vs unknown ranges; but could be good to steal.\n\nWhat is tournament stage? Not given. But stack 13 BB is short, so we might want to preserve chips. A raise of 16 is not huge risk; if called we still have 91 left. That's okay.\n\nThus I think raise to 16 (i.e., 2 BB). Reason: attempt to steal, decent hand, position, and stack size.\n\nWe should check if any opponent has been folding a lot? We saw raises not folds. No data on folds. But SB seems aggressive raising. Could be 3-bet? Actually they are SB, they posted 4, not yet acted. They could 3-bet. If we raise to 16, they'd need to re-raise to at least 32. They have raised 36 in hand 27. So they could 3-bet. But that's okay.\n\nThus decision: raise to 16.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Need to decide fold/call/raise.\n\nWe should consider opponent's tendencies: from recall, seat 4 has many folds preflop, some checks, rarely raises. In last few hands, they mostly folded preflop. So likely a tight player, raising maybe with decent hands. Our hand Th6s is weak, unsuited (actually suited? Th hearts, 6 spades: off-suit). Not a good hand to call raise from a tight player. Also stack 111, we have 13.9 BB. Calling 8 would leave 103 chips. If we call and lose, we lose 8. If we raise, we need at least 24 total, which is 16 more than call. That would be a big commitment with weak hand.\n\nThus fold is appropriate.\n\nCheck if any implied odds? No.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

They could have A4, A5, 44, 55, or combos like KQ? But we have QQ, so they can't have Q. They could have A K for top pair, etc. Our hand is overpair to board (QQ > A? Actually Ace is higher, but board Ace, so any Ace is top pair. Overpair to board is QQ, but Ace is higher rank, but we have no Ace. So we are behind any Ace. Also could be behind set of 4s or 5s, but those are unlikely. So we are likely ahead of many hands, but behind any Ace.\n\nWe have 87 chips, 10.9 BB. Pot is 56. We have 87 left after posting SB? Actually stack includes our remaining after posting SB? We posted 4 SB, then we raised to 24 (including 4? Actually we posted 4 then raise to 24 total? So we invested 24 now? Not needed.\n\nWe can check or raise. Consider opponent's tendencies: Past flop actions show mix of checks and bets. They bet small amounts (2,4,7,8) and also check. They called big bets (40) once. So they can be aggressive or passive.\n\nGiven we have a decent hand (overpair) but vulnerable to Ace, we might want to protect by betting. Pot is 56, we could bet around half pot (30) to charge Ace and draws. However we have short stack 87, pot 56, so a bet of 30 would be about 0.34 of stack, okay.\n\nBut we also could check to see if they bet, then we can call or raise. However checking may give them free cards; they might bet anyway.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: We have short stack ~11 BB, need to accumulate chips but also avoid being eliminated. Overpair is a decent hand to try to pick up chips. A check-raise could be effective if they bet, but we need to have raise to at least 16 (minimum raise). If they bet, we could raise.\n\nNow it's our turn, opponent checked. Options: check or raise. I think raise to around 30-35 (total) to apply pressure. Minimum raise is 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 16 means bet 16 chips. But we might want larger. We can raise to maybe 30 (total). Is that allowed? Minimum raise is 16, we can raise any amount above that up to our stack. So raise to 30.\n\nThus action: raise to 30.\n\nReasoning: Overpair, want to protect against Ace, extract value, opponent likely has weak hand, short stack.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

So board: Ace of clubs, 4 of spades, 5 of diamonds, 2 of spades. So we have queen queens, no pair on board except Ace high. Our hand is still top pair? Actually we have no pair on board, we have overpair to board (Queens over Ace). So we are ahead of any hand except maybe Ace, or any set (but there is no set possible because board doesn't have pair). Straight draws: board has 2-4-5, possible straight with A? Actually 2-4-5, need 3 and 6 for straight. So opponent could have 3 and 6 combos, but they would need both to have straight, unlikely. Flush draws: there are two spades on board (4s,2s). So a flush draw would need two more spades. Opponent could have spade combos. They called preflop and flop, so they could have A? They could have A? They might have Ace (but board already has Ace of clubs). If they have Ace of spades, they'd have top pair Ace and a flush draw (two spades on board, plus Ace spade). That would be strong. Also could have two spades like K\u2660 Q\u2660? But we have Qs, but we have queen spade. Actually we hold Qs, so opponent cannot have Qs. They could have spade combos like J\u2660 T\u2660 for straight flush draw? Not possible. Could have any spade combos for flush draw.\n\nWe have 57 chips, 7.1 BB, short stack. Pot is 116 chips.

Minimum raise to is 30, we can raise to 57 (all-in). Should we? Evaluate equity: If opponent has Ace (any Ace), they'd have top pair Ace, we would be behind. But they could also have flush draw (two spades). If they have Ace, they'd likely call all-in. Our equity vs Ace high is low (maybe 30% if they have A? Actually we have queens vs Ace high, we lose unless they have pocket pair lower than queens? Actually board Ace high, they have Ace, they have pair of Aces. We lose. So against Ace, we lose 100%. Against flush draw, we are ahead but they have outs. Against lower pair (e.g., 44, 55, 22), we are ahead. Against straight draws, we are ahead. So our expected value: If opponent's range includes many Aces, going all-in is risky. But we are short-stacked; we may need to push. Could also check and hope to see river for free card. But opponent may bet and we may be forced to call with limited stack. If we check, opponent may bet about 30-40. Then we have to decide to call with 57 stack. That could be okay if they bet small. But they might bet bigger. Better to take initiative.\n\nGiven we have 57 chips, pot 116, we are at about 0.5 pot effective stack. If we go all-in, we risk 57 chips to win 173 (pot + opponent call).

Actually SB 4, BB 8, then seat4 raise 16). So we face a raise of 16 (to call 16). Minimum raise to 24 (i.e., raise at least 8 more). Our hand: 3d Tc, a Ten low suited (clubs? Actually Ten of clubs? It's Tc, clubs, but 3d diamond). So T3 offsuit (but suited? Ten clubs, three diamonds, so unsuited). That's a weak hand. In BTN vs a raise from MP? Seat4 is maybe MP (position unknown). We have 21.6 BB, short stackish but not super short. Should we fold? Likely yes. Hand is weak, not a good call. Opponent's raise size is 2x BB? Actually raise to 16 is 2x BB (8) plus 8? That's 2 BB raise. That's a standard raise. With T3 off, not good to call. Could consider 3-bet? No, not with T3.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nBut we could check if any opponent tendencies: recall opponent seat4 raise patterns: in hand 58 they raised 16, maybe same size. So they are raising with a range. So folding is safe.\n\nThus JSON.\n\n",

Need to decide.\n\nConsider hand strength: T-J offsuit (unsuited). In early position, generally not a good hand, especially short stack. With 10.8 BB, you could consider a push/fold strategy. At 10.8 BB, many players would push or fold. T-J offsuit is marginal for push; but maybe can call and see flop? But with 16 call, you'd be left with 157 chips after call, still decent. However, the action before you: seat 3 posted small blind 8, seat 4 posted big blind 16. No raises yet. So you can either call 16 or raise. Raising to 32 would be a 2x raise. With 10.8 BB, raising might isolate and maybe get called by later players (positions later). But you are UTG, many players left to act (positions 6-8). Raising may get re-raised. Probably better to fold or push all-in? But you have 10.8 BB; typical push range includes T-J? Some push/fold tables push with any Ace, broadway, maybe T-J suited, but offsuit is weaker. I think fold is safe.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: we could recall opponent actions. But limited time. Might recall that Kimi-K2 (seat 1) is aggressive? Not sure.\n\nGiven short stack, need to preserve chips. T-J offsuit is not strong enough to risk. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON.",

There's a raise from seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) to 169 (so they raised 169 from SB? Actually seat3 raise 169, meaning they raised to 169 total? The raise amount: they posted SB 8, BB 16, then raise 169 (so total bet 169). Amount to call 161 (169-8? Actually BB posted 16, so need to call 153? But given amount to call 161).

Need to decide.\n\nHand strength: K5 offsuit is weak. Against unknown opponent, likely not good. Stack is short, 10.8 BB, so we are short stacked. If we call, we will be left with ~12 chips, which is ~0.75 BB, essentially all-in. Could be a push/fold decision. With K5 offsuit, not a good candidate to push. Better to fold and preserve chips? But we have only 10.8 BB, maybe need to find spots to double up. However calling would be essentially all-in for 161 vs 169 raise (almost all-in). Is this a good spot? Likely not, because K5 is weak, especially against a raise from a short stack (maybe they are shoving). The raise is 169, which is almost the entire stack of that player? Actually we don't know their stack. Seat3 DeepSeek-V3.2 has 0 chips (out). Wait seat3 is out, but they raised 169? That seems contradictory: seat3 is out (0 chips) but they raised 169? Maybe data error; but seat3 is out, maybe they are eliminated but still listed. Actually seat3 has 0 chips, so cannot raise. Something off. Could be that seat3 is the raiser, but they have 0 chips, maybe they are the big blind? No.\n\nGiven the data, we might assume opponent is short stacked and shoving.

Actually raise amount is 32 total, which is 2x big blind). So we face raise of 32, need to call 16 more (since we already posted 16). Minimum raise to 48 (i.e., raise additional 16). Hand: Th 7s. Not a strong hand. In BB short stack ~10 BB, facing a raise from a player who sometimes raises larger (we saw raises up to 177 chips, which is huge relative to stack). But currently raise is only 32, which is 2 BB. So likely a standard open raise from DeepSeek-V3.2. Our hand Th7s is weak, suited but low. In short stack, we could consider a shove if we think we have fold equity, but 10 BB is borderline for shove with marginal hand. Usually with 10 BB you can shove with a decent range, but Th7s is not great. Could call to see flop? But calling 16 chips adds to pot 56, so pot after call would be 72, effective stack after call is 141. Not great. Raising would be to 48 minimum, which is a 32 raise (total 48). That would be a 3-bet. With 10 BB, a 3-bet is a big move, but we could also go all-in (157). However, raising to 48 would still leave us with 109 behind, still short. Considering opponent's raise size is small, they may be opening wide. Our hand is weak, better to fold. Also we have 9.8 BB, can't afford to play many marginal hands.

Since they posted 8, they likely just posted the SB, not raise. Actually SB posted 8 (small blind) and hasn't acted yet. So they are not raising, they are just the SB. So we have to decide to call 8 (i.e., just match the SB) or raise.\n\nOur hand 9T is a decent suited? It's offsuit. In short stack situation, 9T offsuit is a marginal hand.

If we raise to 32, that would be 16 more (since we already have 16 posted). Actually raise to total 32 means we add 16 more chips (since we already have 16). So the total pot after raise would be: SB 8, BB 32 (including our 16 posted + 16 additional), plus maybe the call to 8? Wait: The raise to 32 would be total contribution from BB = 32, meaning we add 16 more beyond the 16 we posted. So the total pot would be 8 (SB) + 32 (BB) = 40 chips, plus maybe any other?

However, if SB is tight, they may fold. But we have no info about SB's tendencies except raise amounts preflop (they have raised sometimes). They might be aggressive. However, they are the SB; they haven't yet acted. They could raise, but they already posted 8. In many games, SB can raise to steal. So we need to anticipate if they will raise? Actually the action order: SB posts 8, BB posts 16, then SB acts first preflop. So SB can either check (i.e., just call the BB's 16? Actually they can call the BB's 16 by putting additional 8? Wait: In heads-up BB vs SB, after blinds, SB acts first. Options: they can raise, or they can check (i.e., just call the BB's 16). In many poker rules, after blinds posted, the SB can either raise or check (i.e., just call the BB's blind). So the amount to call for SB is 8 (to match BB's 16). So the SB can check (i.e., call) or raise.\n\nThus our decision is to either call the SB's 8 (i.e., just match the blind, effectively checking) or raise. If we call, the pot will be 8+16=24?

So currently we have to act after a call, no raise yet. Amount to call 16, min raise 32. So we can call 16 to see flop. Hand QdTh is decent suited? It's off-suit (Qd Th). In CO, with short stack 10.8 BB, typical push/fold range is fairly wide. With 10 BB, you can consider shoving. But there is still 2 players left to act after us (Seat6? Actually seat6 not listed; seat1 maybe still to act). There are 5 seats total? Actually seats 1-5; we are seat5. So after us, seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) will act. So we could call 16 and see flop, but stack shallow.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: We could recall opponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) call 16 from MP. Might be a loose call. Seat1 is unknown.\n\nGiven stack 173 chips, call 16 leaves 157 chips. If we call and flop is good, we could still be in position.\n\nBut QTh is not premium; it's a marginal hand. With 10 BB, many players would shove rather than call. However call 16 is only 1 BB. It's cheap. The risk: If we call and get out of position vs later raises, we might be forced to fold later.\n\nGiven we are in cutoff, we could consider raising to isolate. Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise by 16). Raising to 32 would be 2 BB raise. That is small but could isolate seat4 who just called. However seat4 may have a wide range, but raising could also get us 3-bet.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should shove all-in? But we have 173 chips, min raise is 32, all-in would be 173. That's a big raise. Is it advisable with QTh? Likely not.\n\nBetter to call 16 and see flop; if flop is good, we can commit. If not, we can fold.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nCheck legality: call is allowed.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Preflop actions: SB (seat2) posted 8, BB (seat3) posted 16, seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called 16 (so just called big blind), seat5 (us) called 16 (so we just called big blind). Then seat1 folded, seat2 folded, seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised 64 (so after us calling, DeepSeek raises to 64 total? Actually raise amount 64 meaning they put total 64? The action log: seat3 raise 64. Since they are in seat3 (DeepSeek) after we called, they raise 64. So they are raising to 64 total (i.e., they add 48 more). Then seat4 (MiniMax) calls 48 (so matches to 64). Now amount to call is 48 (to match DeepSeek's raise). Minimum raise to 112. Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nOur hand: T\u2665 Q\u2666 (offsuit). In BB with 9.8 BB, short stack but not ultra short. Opponent DeepSeek raised 64 (4x big blind). That is a sizable raise. They are seat3 (position? Let's map seats: seat1 is after seat8? Not sure. We are seat5 BB. Seat2 SB, seat3 (DeepSeek) is UTG? Actually typical order: Seats 1-8 clockwise. SB is seat2, BB seat3? Wait they said \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So seat5 is BB. So seat2 is SB, seat3 is UTG? Let's compute: Seat numbers: 1 is UTG? Usually seat1 is first left of dealer? Not sure. But we know we are BB seat5, so seats 6-8 are later positions (CO, BTN). So seat3 (DeepSeek) is early position (maybe UTG+1). So they are raising from early position, likely strong.\n\nOur stack 157, after calling 16 we have 141 left. To call 48 we need 48 more, leaving 93. That's okay.\n\nHand TQ offsuit is decent but not premium. In early position raise, likely they have a range of strong hands (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK, AQ, maybe AJs, KQs). TQ offsuit is at bottom of value.\n\nGiven short stack and tournament, we may consider folding. However we have 9.8 BB, still enough to attempt steal? But we are out of position (BB vs early raise). Also we have 4 players in pot (SB folded, we called, MiniMax called). So pot will be 152 + 64 (raise) + 48 (call) = 264? Actually pot before raise was 152 (blinds + our call + MiniMax call). Then DeepSeek raised to 64 (adds 48 more). MiniMax called 48 (adds 48). So now pot is 152 + 48 (DeepSeek's extra) + 48 (MiniMax) = 248? Wait need to compute precisely: initial pot 152 includes blinds (8+16) + our call 16 + MiniMax call 16? Actually MiniMax called 16 before raise. So pot before DeepSeek raise: blinds 8+16=24, plus MiniMax call 16 = 40, plus our call 16 = 56, plus seat2 fold? seat1 fold. So pot 56? But they listed pot 152 chips. That's probably after all actions? Actually they listed pot 152 before actions? Might be current pot before DeepSeek raise? Hmm.\n\nGiven ambiguous, but we can compute effective stack: 157 total. To call 48 we need to invest 64 total (16 already). So call would be 48 more.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call, or raise. Raising would be to 112 minimum (i.e., raise total to 112). That would be 96 total invested (16+96?). Actually raise to 112 means we put total 112 chips into pot, which is 96 more beyond our 16 call. That is a big commitment: 112 is 7.0 BB, about 70% of stack (since stack 157). That's a big raise. Likely not advisable with TQ offsuit.\n\nThus best is to fold.\n\nBut maybe we could call and see flop with decent equity (~15%). However with short stack, maybe we can shove? All-in would be 157, but raise_to 112 is not all-in. We could raise all-in (since can't raise to more than our stack). But raising all-in with TQ offsuit vs early raise is too"

Actually they raised 184 from SB? The actions: seat4 post sb 8, seat5 post bb 16, seat1 fold, seat2 fold, seat3 raise 184, seat4 fold. So seat3 raised to 184 total bet, which is 184 chips total, i.e., they put 184 in (so they raised 184-16? Not important). Amount to call is 168 (since 184-16). Minimum raise to 352.\n\nOur stack is 141, less than amount to call (168). So we cannot call; we can only fold or go all-in (which would be a call of our remaining chips). However legal actions only list fold, call. Usually if you are short, you can go all-in as a call for less than amount to call. But maybe the system only allows call if you have enough chips? Might be that you can call all-in for 141, which is less than required, but it's considered call (all-in). Usually allowed.\n\nGiven hand 2h9d is weak, especially out of position, short stack. The raise is sizable (184) relative to our stack. Likely not worth risking. Better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

That's a gutshot (needs 5 or 9). So we have a gutshot and a backdoor flush draw. Not strong.\n\nOpponent (Seat 3) checked. So we can check or raise. With only 7.3 BB left, we are short-stacked. Our stack 117, pot 32. Minimum raise is 16 (to total 16? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in, so raise to 16 means put 16 chips total? Usually raise to 16 means you bet 16 total, but we already have 16 in pot as blind. Actually we are in BB, we posted 16. So to raise to 16 would be just checking? Wait legal actions: raise to at least min raise 16. That means we need to put total of 16 chips more? Usually raise amount is total bet size. Since we are in BB and no bet, the min raise is 2x BB = 32? But they say min raise to 16. Perhaps they treat raise_to as total amount you put in this round, not counting previous. Since we have already posted 16, raising to 16 would be just checking? This is confusing. In typical poker engine, raise_to is total amount you are betting including what you already have in pot. Since we have already 16 in pot, raising to 16 would be just checking (i.e., no additional chips). But they list min raise to 16, maybe meaning you need to raise to at least 32 (i.e., add 16). So raise_to = 32. However they ask to set raise_to to total amount you are putting in, not additional. So if we raise to 32, that means we add 16 more chips. That matches min raise to 16 (additional). So raise_to should be 32. Let's assume that.\n\nGiven our short stack, we might consider an all-in raise to try to steal or fold. Opponent checked, likely weak. Our hand is weak, but we could try to steal the pot with a bluff? However opponent may have Qx or something. Since they are short (they have 234 chips). They might call if they have Q or a pair. Raising to 32 (small) may be called by many hands, losing chips. Better to check and see turn. But we have only 7.3 BB, if we check and they bet later we may be forced all-in.\n\nGiven the situation, checking is safe. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions include raise, but we choose check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 48 (so raise amount 48 total? Actually they raised 48 after posting 16, so they put 48 total? The raise amount is 48? The amount to call is 40 (they raised to 48, we have posted 16, so need 32? Wait: small blind 8, big blind 16. Seat 2 raised to 48, meaning they put 48 total. So amount to call = 48 - 16 = 32. But the problem says amount to call: 40. That suggests they posted 8 (SB) seat 5, seat 1 posted BB 16, seat 2 raise 48 (so maybe they raised to 48, meaning they added 48 on top of big blind? Usually raise to 48 means total bet is 48. Then amount to call = 48 - 16 = 32. But they say amount to call 40, maybe they consider we posted 8 as SB? Actually seat 5 is BB, so they posted 16 as BB. seat 1 posted SB 8. Wait seat order: seat 5 is BB, seat 1 is SB. So seat 5 posted SB 8? The actions show: Seat 5 post_sb 8, Seat 1 post_bb 16. So seat 5 is small blind, seat 1 is big blind. That's weird: position says BB seat5 but actions show seat5 posted sb. Possibly the seat numbers are shifted: they consider seat5 is BB but posted SB. Anyway, amount to call 40. So we need to call 40 to match raise. Minimum raise to 80 (so raise total to 80). Our stack 141, can raise.\n\nHand Jd8s is weak, off-suit, low connectivity. In early position (BB) vs a raise from seat2 (likely UTG? Actually seat2 is after big blind? Not sure). In tournament, short stack 8.8 BB. Should we fold? Likely yes. But consider that opponent raise size is 48 (3x big blind?), actually big blind is 16, raise to 48 is 3x BB. That's a standard raise. With 8.8 BB, calling 40 would leave us ~101 chips, still decent. But J8 offsuit is not a good hand to call. Could consider a shove? All-in would be 141, which is >3x raise. But J8 offsuit is not a good shoving hand at 8 BB; typical shoving range includes broadways, suited connectors, A-x, etc. J8 offsuit is borderline but maybe too weak.\n\nThus fold.\n\nWe could also recall opponent tendencies: they raise amounts varying, sometimes 48, sometimes 24, sometimes 12. No specific aggression. Likely a standard raise.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

Actually SB 8, BB 16, plus our seat? Wait we are BTN, we posted nothing yet. The pot includes SB 8, BB 16 = 24. So we need to call 16 to see flop.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call, raise. Our hand is weak but suited, could be a steal. With 8.8 BB, we could consider raising to try to steal blinds. However, we are out of position (BTN vs SB and BB). The SB is seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking (140 chips). The BB is seat2 Kimi-K2 (445 chips). Both have larger stacks. We have 8.8 BB, short. The SB is short too (140 chips ~ same). So both are short stacks.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall opponent actions shows Kimi-K2 (BB) raising amounts: 6,12,12,24,24,40,48,48,48,48. Those raise amounts likely relative to blind? Not clear. But they have raised 48 chips preflop (which is 3 BB) maybe? Actually blind is 8/16, so 48 is 3x BB? Wait BB is 16, so 48 is 3 BB. So they have been raising 3 BB sometimes. Also Kimi-K2 Thinking (SB) raised amounts: 8,8,12,36,12,16,24,16,24. Those are maybe amounts over SB? Not clear.\n\nWe need to know if they are aggressive. They have raised preflop many times, indicating they might be open-raising from early positions. But we are BTN, they are SB and BB. The SB may have posted 8 and could be defending. The BB is 16.\n\nGiven our short stack, typical play is either push all-in or fold, unless we have a decent hand. 6s5s is marginal for push. However, we could consider a steal raise to 48 (3 BB) to try to win blinds, but we have only 8.8 BB, raising to 48 would be 3 BB (48). Minimum raise is 32 (2 BB). Could raise to 48 to apply pressure. But is that advisable with 6-5 suited? Usually short stack steal range is broader, maybe any suited connectors, but 6-5 is low, risk of being called by better hands. The opponents have larger stacks; they may call with any pair, A-high, etc. But they may also be short and want to defend.\n\nGiven our stack is low, we could also consider going all-in (141 chips). That would be 141 total (including our call). That's about 8.8 BB. All-in might be okay with any hand as a shove, but with 6-5 suited it's borderline. But typical short stack push range from BTN includes any pair, any suited ace, broadway, maybe suited connectors down to 5-4 suited. 6-5 suited could be okay.\n\nBut we need to consider that the BB is 445 chips, so they can call. The SB is also 140 chips, similar to us, so they might call all-in with any pair or better.\n\nWe need to decide legal actions: fold, call, raise. Raising to 48 is allowed (minimum raise 32). Raising all-in (141) is also a raise (to total 141). Since raise_to is total amount we put in. All-in is allowed if we can't meet min raise? We can raise to any amount up to our stack.\n\nGiven short stack, a shove could be optimal. But is there any rule about tournament considerations? Preserving chips vs accumulation. With 8.8 BB, you are near the bubble? Not given. But typical optimal is to go all-in with any hand that has some equity. 6-5 suited has about 35% vs random hand, maybe 30% vs typical calling range. Might be okay.\n\nBut also could just call 16 and see flop cheap. However, with 6-5 suited, flop potential is decent, but we have limited implied odds due to short stack. If we call and miss, we are left with 125 chips, still short. Might be okay to see flop.\n\nGiven the pot odds: call 16 to win 24+16=40? Actually pot is 24, we call 16, total pot becomes 40. So we are paying 16 to win 40, pot odds 2.5:1, need ~28% equity. Our hand vs random is about"

Pot 24 chips (SB+BB+our blind? Actually SB 8, BB 16, plus our seat? Wait we are BTN, we posted nothing yet. The pot includes SB 8, BB 16 = 24. So we need to call 16 to see flop.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call, raise. Our hand is weak but suited, could be a steal. With 8.8 BB, we could consider raising to try to steal blinds. However, we are out of position (BTN vs SB and BB). The SB is seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking (140 chips). The BB is seat2 Kimi-K2 (445 chips). Both have larger stacks. We have 8.8 BB, short. The SB is short too (140 chips ~ same). So both are short stacks.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall opponent actions shows Kimi-K2 (BB) raising amounts: 6,12,12,24,24,40,48,48,48,48. Those raise amounts likely relative to blind? Not clear. But they have raised 48 chips preflop (which is 3 BB) maybe? Actually blind is 8/16, so 48 is 3x BB? Wait BB is 16, so 48 is 3 BB. So they have been raising 3 BB sometimes. Also Kimi-K2 Thinking (SB) raised amounts: 8,8,12,36,12,16,24,16,24. Those are maybe amounts over SB? Not clear.\n\nWe need to know if they are aggressive. They have raised preflop many times, indicating they might be open-raising from early positions. But we are BTN, they are SB and BB. The SB may have posted 8 and could be defending. The BB is 16.\n\nGiven our short stack, typical play is either push all-in or fold, unless we have a decent hand. 6s5s is marginal for push. However, we could consider a steal raise to 48 (3 BB) to try to win blinds, but we have only 8.8 BB, raising to 48 would be 3 BB (48). Minimum raise is 32 (2 BB). Could raise to 48 to apply pressure. But is that advisable with 6-5 suited? Usually short stack steal range is broader, maybe any suited connectors, but 6-5 is low, risk of being called by better hands. The opponents have larger stacks; they may call with any pair, A-high, etc. But they may also be short and want to defend.\n\nGiven our stack is low, we could also consider going all-in (141 chips). That would be 141 total (including our call). That's about 8.8 BB. All-in might be okay with any hand as a shove, but with 6-5 suited it's borderline. But typical short stack push range from BTN includes any pair, any suited ace, broadway, maybe suited connectors down to 5-4 suited. 6-5 suited could be okay.\n\nBut we need to consider that the BB is 445 chips, so they can call. The SB is also 140 chips, similar to us, so they might call all-in with any pair or better.\n\nWe need to decide legal actions: fold, call, raise. Raising to 48 is allowed (minimum raise 32).

Also we have a backdoor flush draw with spades (two spades in hand, board has no spades). So moderate hand. Stack 125 chips, blinds 8/16, we are short stack ~7.8 BB. Pot 40 chips. Opponent is Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) with 445 chips, big stack. He checked flop. He is the big blind, likely will act next. He checked, we have check option. Should we check or raise? Considering our stack is short, we may want to steal blinds? But it's flop, not preflop. If we bet, we can try to take down pot. Our hand is middle pair, could be best but also vulnerable to overpairs (8+, etc). Opponent has deep stack, may call with many draws. But we are short, we may want to pick up chips. The pot is 40, we have 125 left, we could raise to maybe 40-50? Minimum raise is 16 (to 32 total?). Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Minimum raise to is 16, meaning raise total to 32? Wait: \"Minimum raise to: 16\" maybe means raise amount? Usually raise to at least 2*big blind = 32? But they say raise_to is total amount you put in. If amount to call is 0, raise to 16 means we put 16 chips total, i.e., bet 16. So we can bet 16 minimum. With 125 stack, that's okay. Should we bet? Consider pot odds: opponent can call 16 for pot 56 (40+16). That's about 28% equity needed. Our hand maybe 30%? Might be okay. Also we have draws. Might be good to bet.\n\nBut opponent may have strong hand and raise. If we raise, we could get re-raised and be forced all-in. However we have short stack; we could go all-in 125, but that's huge relative to pot. Might be overkill.\n\nGiven short stack, we could try to steal the pot by betting 16 (small) and hope he folds. If he calls, we can evaluate turn. Probably best to bet.\n\nThus action: raise to 16? Actually raise_to total amount we put in = 16. That is a bet of 16.

We are in BB, amount to call 0, can check or raise. Hand 6h Jc is weak, not a premium hand, especially short stack. In short stack, need to find spots to shove or fold. But we cannot raise less than min raise 64 (i.e., raise to 64 total? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in; min raise to is 64, meaning you need to put total 64 chips (i.e., raise by 32 more). That would be a raise of 32 additional, making total contribution 64. That is a raise to 64, which is 2 BB raise (since blind is 32). Our stack is 133, so we could raise to 64 (i.e., put 64 total). That would be a 2x raise, leaving us with 69 chips left. However, 6h Jc is not a good hand to raise. Could consider shoving all-in? Not allowed? We can raise only to min raise; we could also go all-in as a raise if we can't meet min raise? The rule says if you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in. But we can afford it. So likely we should fold or check. Checking will see flop cheap, but we are short stacked; if we check and get called, we will see flop with 6h Jc, not great. Better to fold and preserve chips for better spot? But we have only 133 chips, folding loses 32 BB (the blind) but we already posted BB. Actually we are in BB, already posted 32. If we fold now, we lose the BB (32) and are out of the hand. That leaves us with 101 chips left (since we already posted 32). Wait we posted 32, then we can fold (i.e., check). Actually folding after posting BB is just checking? In poker, you cannot fold after posting the blind if no one raised; you can either check (i.e., continue) or raise. If you \"fold\", you would discard your blind and not play? In tournament, you cannot fold the blind after the action returns to you; you can only check or raise. So \"fold\" would be illegal? The legal actions list includes fold, check, raise. So fold is allowed? In many implementations, you can fold after posting blind if there is a raise to you. But here amount to call is 0, so folding means you forfeit your blind? Usually you cannot fold after posting blind unless there is a raise. But the system includes fold as legal. So you could fold and lose your blind, but you keep remaining stack (101). That might be the best given weak hand.\n\nThus decision: fold (i.e., give up the hand). Reason: short stack, weak hand, not worth risking more chips.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Opponent's raise size is modest, and shoving now either wins the pot outright or puts us all\u2011in for our remaining chips, preventing later forced all\u2011ins with weaker hands.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have SB with pocket pair 2s, stack 117 chips (3.7 BB). Blinds 16/32. Already posted 16 SB, BB posted 32. Pot 128 (includes both blinds). Opponent (Seat 3) raised to 80, which is 48 over BB? Actually raise amount: they put 80 total, so they added 48 (since BB is 32). So amount to call is 64 (80-16). Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., raise by at least 48 more). Our stack is 117, after posting SB 16, we have 101 left? Actually total stack includes posted SB? Usually stack includes chips not yet posted; they posted SB 16, so remaining 101. To call 64 we need 64 chips more, leaving 37 chips. To raise to 128 total (i.e., add 48 more than call) would require 128 - 16 =112 total contribution? Wait raise_to is total amount you put in this round including previous contributions? In guidelines: \"raise_to is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\". So if we raise to 128, we need to have total contribution of 128 chips. We already posted 16, so need additional 112. Our remaining stack 101 can't cover 112, so cannot raise to 128; we could go all-in for 117 total, which is less than min raise, but maybe allowed as all-in? Rule: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So we could go all-in (117 total) which is raise to 117 (or maybe 117 total). But is that allowed? Usually you can go all-in for less than min raise, but it's considered a call? In tournament, you can go all-in for less than min raise; it's treated as a raise if it's at least call? Actually if you go all-in for less than min raise, it's a call if you cannot raise. However rule says you can go all-in if you can't afford min raise. So we could raise all-in.\n\nNow evaluate hand: 2-2 is low pocket pair. With 3.7 BB, short stack, we might consider shove (all-in) or fold. Opponent's raise size: 80 into 128 pot, that's about 2.5 BB raise (actually 80 total, so raise 48 over BB, 48/32=1.5 BB). Not huge. Opponent is DeepSeek-V3.2. Past behavior: raises varied amounts: 177, 32, 56, 64, 184. So they raise a range of sizes, sometimes small (32) sometimes large. Not sure about tightness. With short stack, we could shove with any pair? Typically with 3 BB, you can shove with any pocket pair, maybe also suited connectors. 2-2 is the weakest pair, but still a set possibility. Against a raise, shoving may be okay to try to steal blinds and maybe get called by worse or fold.\n\nConsider equity: If we call 64, we have 37 left, vulnerable to further raises? After call, we will be in the big blind with 37 chips, could be forced all-in later. Better to go all-in now to maximize chance.\n\nOpponent's stack 170 chips, about 5.3 BB. They could call or re-raise. If they re-raise, they'd risk more.\n\nGiven our short stack, typical play is to go all-in (shove) with any pocket pair. So we should raise (all-in) to 117 total (or maybe raise to 117). Legal actions include raise, we can raise to 117 (all-in). Provide reasoning.\n\nThus JSON: action \"raise\", raise_to 117, reasoning.\n\n",

The stack 5 chips is maybe after posting? The pot is 288, which seems huge relative to stack. Something inconsistent. Probably the stack is 5 chips (0.2 BB) meaning we are short stacked, but we still posted blinds? Actually if stack is 5 chips and blinds 16/32, you cannot post 32. Maybe the stack is after posting? So we have 5 chips left after posting BB 32? That would be negative. So maybe these numbers are not real; it's a simulation. But we have quads, we want to get as much as possible.

Need to know legal actions. Not provided. We must infer from situation: It's our turn (BB) after opponent actions on turn? Not listed. Possibly opponent checked on turn as well? The legal actions likely are check or bet/raise? But we need to query opponent actions? However we have limited info. We can use recall_opponent_actions to see opponent's behavior on turn in similar spots. But we need current legal actions. Could be check or bet (raise). Since we have 5 chips total, very short stack (0.2 BB). Our stack is 5 chips, blinds are 16/32, so we are deep short. Pot is 288 chips, we have a set of twos (pocket pair 2c2d, board has two twos already, so we have quads! Actually board has 2s 2h, we have 2c 2d => we have quads (four of a kind). That's the nuts, unbeatable. So we should try to get maximum value. Opponent (Seat 3) has 122 chips, likely has something like maybe a straight draw? Board: 2s 2h Jh 5c. Potential draws: maybe 9-10 for straight? Not likely. Opponent could have Jx for trips, but they'd have at least a set of Jacks. But we have quads, they could have Jacks, but they'd have three Jacks (Jx with board J). That's weaker. So we want to bet/raise to get value. However we have only 5 chips left; opponent's stack 122 chips. Minimum raise to 48 (from flop) but that's preflop? Actually minimum raise to 48 is from flop stage. But on turn, min bet is maybe 48? Not sure. Our stack 5 chips, we cannot meet min raise of 48, so we can go all-in for 5 chips. That's allowed (all-in). Legal actions likely include raise (all-in) or check. We should bet all-in to extract value. Opponent may call.\n\nThus action: raise to 5 (all-in). Reasoning: we have quads, unbeatable, need value, short stack.\n\nWe must ensure raise_to is total amount we put in. Our stack is 5 chips, but we already posted blind 16? Actually preflop we posted 16 as SB? Wait we are BB seat 5, posted SB 16? Actually blinds: 16/32, seat5 is BB, but actions show \"post_sb 16\" for seat5 preflop. So maybe seat5 is SB not BB? Confusing. But we have 5 chips remaining after posting? Actually stack 5 chips now includes our blind posted? Not sure. But we have 5 chips left total. So all-in 5.\n\nThus JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have a hand on turn. Our hand: pocket twos (2c 2d). Board: 2s 2h Jh 5c. So we have quads (four of a kind) 2s 2h 2c 2d. That's the nuts. Opponent (Seat 3) bet 48 into pot 336? Wait pot after turn before bet: preflop pot? Let's compute: preflop: blinds 16+32=48, then raise 80 from seat3 (to 80?), Actually seat3 raise 80 (meaning raise to 80? Usually raise to 80 total? He posted blind? He is in SB? Wait seat5 is BB, seat1 is BB? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? The actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 16 (so seat5 is small blind). Seat1 post_bb 32 (big blind). Seat2 fold. Seat3 raise 80. Seat5 raise 128 (so seat5 re-raises to 128). Seat1 fold. Seat3 call 48 (calls to 128). So pot after preflop: blinds 48 + raise amounts. Let's compute: seat3 raised to 80 (so added 64 extra beyond 16? Actually seat3 had no blind, so contributed 80). Then seat5 raise to 128, adding 112 beyond 16. Seat3 call 48 (to match 128). So total contributions: seat5: 16+112=128, seat1: 32, seat3: 80+48=128, seat2:0. Total pot = 128+32+80? Wait we double counted? Let's just sum contributions: seat5 128, seat1 32, seat3 128 = 288. So pot 288 pre-flop. Then flop: both check, pot still 288. Turn: both check, then seat3 bets 48. So pot before bet: 288 + 0 (no flop bets) = 288. After bet, pot becomes 336 (as given). So we are facing a bet 48 into pot 336. We have quads, unbeatable. So we should call (or raise if allowed). But legal actions: fold, call. Minimum raise to 96, but raise not in legal actions (maybe because we are short stacked? Actually we have 5 chips left, which is less than min raise 96, but we could go all-in. However legal actions only list fold, call. So we cannot raise because we cannot meet min raise, but we could go all-in? Usually if you cannot meet min raise, you can go all-in but still considered a raise? In many rules, you can go all-in for less than min raise, but it's considered a raise. However the system says legal actions: fold, call. So we cannot raise. So we must either call or fold. Obviously we call to win. Also note we have only 5 chips left, but need to call 48? Wait our stack is 5 chips (0.2 BB). So we cannot call 48 because we only have 5 chips left. That seems contradictory. Actually amount to call is 48, but we only have 5 chips left, meaning we are short stacked and cannot cover bet. In that case we are forced to go all-in for 5 chips (call all-in). The system may treat that as call (since call all-in). So we call (all-in). So action: call. Reasoning: we have quads, unbeatable, want to get max value, call all-in.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #86 preflop. Position BTN, stack 218 chips (6.8 BB). Blinds 16/32, so effective stack is small (6.8 BB). Our hand: 7s Kc (suited? No, 7 spades, King clubs). It's a decent hand for BTN short stack? King-high with 7 kicker. With 6.8 BB, we could consider push/fold strategy. Minimum raise is 64 (so 2 BB raise). We could call 16 (to see flop) but stack is shallow. Typically with 6.8 BB, you either push all-in or fold, rarely call. But we can raise to 64 (which is 2BB). However, we could also go all-in (218). But legal actions: raise, call, fold. Minimum raise 64, we could raise to 64 (which is a standard raise). But with 6.8 BB, raising to 64 leaves us with ~150 behind. The opponent (Kimi-K2) is in BB with 686 chips. Their tendencies: from recall, they have raised 48 (2.5 BB) in hand 74 and 78, raised 200 in hand 84, called 16 in hand 85. So they sometimes raise big, sometimes call. They also bet on river etc. Not clear if they are aggressive or tight. With short stack, we may want to go all-in to maximize fold equity. The raise to 64 is small relative to opponent's stack; they may call with many hands. So better to shove all-in (218) if allowed? The legal action \"raise\" can be to any amount up to our stack? Typically yes. So we can raise to 218 (all-in). That would be best.\n\nCheck pot odds: we have to call 16 to see flop; but with 7K offsuit, not great. If we call, we risk 16 and can be out of chips if we lose flop. Better to push.\n\nThus decision: raise to 218 (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, want to maximize fold equity, Kc7s is decent for push, opponent's BB likely to fold many hands to an all-in.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have a tournament scenario, very short stack: 16 chips total, blinds 16/32, we are BTN with 0.5 BB (actually 16 chips is 1 big blind? Wait blinds 16/32, so small blind 16, big blind 32. Our stack is 16 chips, which is exactly the small blind amount. But we posted SB preflop? Actually actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 16, so we posted small blind of 16, leaving us with 0 chips? Wait stack is 16 chips, we posted SB 16, so we have 0 remaining? But later we raise 218, that seems impossible. Something inconsistent: maybe stack is 16 chips after posting SB? But they show stack 16 chips, then we post SB 16, then raise 218? That can't be. Perhaps the stack displayed is before posting SB? Actually typical representation: stack includes blind posted? Usually stack includes chips before posting, then posting reduces effective stack. But they show \"Your Stack: 16 chips (0.5 BB)\" but blinds are 16/32, so 0.5 BB is 16 chips, which is 0.5 big blind? Actually 1 BB = 32 chips, so 0.5 BB = 16 chips. So we have 0.5 BB total, which is the small blind amount. So we posted SB of 16, leaving us with 0 chips left to act. But the actions show we raise 218, which suggests we have more chips. Something off: maybe the stack is after posting SB? But then we couldn't raise. Possibly the stack shown is after posting, but they still allow raise because we have the ability to go all-in? However raise to 218 would be more than our stack (which is 0). So maybe the stack is before posting, and we have 16 chips, we post 16 SB, leaving 0, but then we raise 218 meaning we are effectively all-in for 218? Not possible.\n\nMaybe the numbers are scaled: blinds 16/32, but stack 16 chips is 0.5 BB, but they treat BB as 32 chips, so 0.5 BB = 16 chips. So we have 0.5 BB effective stack, which is less than BB, so we are short-stacked. Yet raise of 218 is huge relative to stack. Something off. Could be a mistake in the scenario; we should treat that we have enough chips to raise to 218? But legal actions only fold, check. So we cannot raise; only fold or check. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. So we should check.\n\nNow consider hand: we have 7s Kc, board 7h Tc 3s. We have a pair of sevens (top pair?) Actually board has 7h, we have 7s, so we have a pair of sevens, kicker K. Potential draws? Not many. Opponent (Seat2) checked. We have 0.5 BB left? Actually we have no chips? But we can check to see if we can win the pot. If we check, we go to turn.\n\nThus decision: check.\n\nWe must output JSON with action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Not immediate.\n\nWe have 16 chips, 0.5 BB, stack is tiny. We are essentially short-stacked; we have 16 chips total, blinds are 16/32, we are BTN with 16 chips, we posted SB? Actually preflop actions: seat5 post_sb 16 (small blind) then seat2 post_bb 32. So we are SB with 16 chips (all-in?) Actually we posted small blind of 16, which is our whole stack, so we are effectively all-in already. Then we raised 218? Wait how can we raise with 16 chips? The actions show: preflop seat5 post_sb 16, seat2 post_bb 32, seat5 raise 218, seat2 call 186. That seems inconsistent with stack size. Possibly the stack after posting SB is 16 chips left? But raise to 218 suggests we have more chips. Maybe the stack listed is after posting SB? Actually \"Your Stack: 16 chips (0.5 BB)\" indicates we have 16 chips total, which is the small blind amount. So we posted SB, then we raise (all-in) to 16? The raise to 218 maybe a mistake. Perhaps the representation is off: maybe the numbers are in chips, blinds 16/32, but our stack is 16 chips (0.5 BB) means we are short-stacked. So we cannot raise; only fold or check. Since amount to call is 0, we can check.\n\nGiven we are all-in already, checking is effectively done. So we should check.\n\nReasoning: we have a pair of sevens, but short stack, cannot raise; checking to see if opponent bets later.\n\nThus action: check.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on river. Situation: we are BTN with 7s Kc. Board: 7h Tc 3s 6d 6h. So we have pair of sevens (top pair) with K kicker. Opponent (seat2) has been checking all streets. We have 16 chips left, which is 0.5 BB? Wait blinds 16/32, our stack is 16 chips (0.5 BB). Actually we are short stacked, only 16 chips left. The pot is 436 chips, huge relative to our stack. We cannot raise because minimum raise is 186, we cannot afford. So only legal actions: fold or check. Check means we go all-in? Actually check means we just check, but there is no bet to call. The pot is 436, we have 16 chips, we can check and then showdown, we will win if our hand is best. Let's evaluate hand strength: we have a pair of sevens. Opponent's range? They have been checking all streets, likely weak or drawing. Board: 7h Tc 3s 6d 6h. There is a possible full house for opponent: they could have 6-6 (but board already has pair of 6s). Actually board has pair of 6s. So opponent could have 6x for trips? Actually board already has two 6s, so any 6 gives trips (three of a kind). They could have 6-6 for quads? Not possible because only two 6s left in deck, they could have both 6s, making four of a kind. That's possible but unlikely. They could have a straight: board has T, 3, 6, 6, 7. Straight possibilities: 8-9? Not present. 9-8-7-6-5? Not present. 5-4-3-2-A? Not. So no straight. Flush possible? Board has hearts: 7h, 6h, plus? Actually 7h and 6h are hearts, plus? No other hearts on board. So two hearts on board, need three hearts in hand for flush, impossible. So opponent could have a higher pair: maybe a pair of tens (T) making trips? Actually board has a T, so a T would give trips. They could have T? Actually board has a single T, so a T in hand gives pair of tens (two tens) not trips. Wait board: Tc. So if opponent has T? They would have two tens (pair). Not as strong as our pair of sevens? Actually pair of tens is higher than pair of sevens. So opponent could have T? That would be better. Also could have a 6 for trips (makes three 6s). Could have a 7 for trips (makes three 7s). Could have a full house: e.g., 6-7 gives full house (6s over 7s) or 7-7 gives full house (7s over something). Actually board: 7h, Tc, 3s, 6d, 6h. If opponent has 7-6, they'd have 6s full of 7s? Actually they'd have three 6s (board has two 6s + one 6 in hand) and a pair of 7s (board has one 7 + one 7 in hand) => full house 6s full of 7s, which beats our pair of sevens. If they have 7-7, they'd have three 7s (board one 7 + two in hand) and a pair of 6s (board two 6s) => full house 7s full of 6s, also beats us. If they have 6-6, they'd have four of a kind 6s, beats us. If they have 6-? other, they'd have trips 6s. If they have 7-? other, they'd have trips 7s. So many combos beat us.\n\nOur hand is relatively weak: pair of sevens only, low kicker (K) but board has K? No K on board. So our kicker irrelevant. Opponent could also have a straight draw missed, but they checked all river, maybe they have nothing.\n\nGiven we are short stacked, we cannot raise. Checking leads to showdown. Should we fold? Folding would lose the pot. Since we cannot raise, checking is best. We should check and hope we win. So action: check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

So both seem willing to raise preflop, possibly with a range of hands. We're on BTN with Kd6d (unsuited, not connected). Hand strength: about 10% preflop. In BTN, we could open raise to 4 (min raise) or call 2 (just limp). Considering opponents likely raise if we limp? Actually they are in blinds, they could raise after we act? Wait preflop order: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then we are BTN (last to act). The amount to call is 2 (BB). So we can call 2, raise to at least 4 (total). If we raise, we may isolate against SB and BB. Kd6d is weak, not a good raise. Better to fold or call? In BTN, limping is generally not recommended with weak hands. Folding is safe. However, we have decent stack (98.5 BB). We could call 2 and see flop cheap. But opponents may raise after us? Actually after BTN, action goes to SB then BB? No, preflop order: SB, BB, then BTN, then remaining players (but only these three are left). After BTN acts, action ends preflop; SB and BB already posted blinds and cannot raise again unless there is a raise. So if we call, we go to flop with SB and BB having posted 1 and 2 respectively. So we would see flop cheap.\n\nGiven Kd6d is not a strong hand, but suited? Actually Kd6d both diamonds, suited! So it's a suited king with 6, potential flush draws, but still weak. In BTN, we could limp to see flop cheap, but also risk being out of position after flop (we will be first to act preflop? Actually after flop, BTN is last to act preflop, but after flop the order is SB, BB, BTN (so BTN is last). So being last is advantage. So limping might be okay with suited connectors, but K6 suited is borderline. Many players fold K6 suited from BTN. Could also raise to isolate and maybe take down blinds. However opponents have been raising preflop, indicating they may have wide ranges. A raise could get them to fold, but they are likely to call with many hands. Might be okay to raise to 4 (2 BB) to steal blinds. But K6 suited is not a premium hand to raise. In tournament early stage, you can steal with many hands. However our stack is 98.5 BB, not short. So we can be selective.\n\nI think best action: fold? But we have already posted no money except maybe we are not forced. The amount to call is 2 (BB). Folding loses nothing. Calling 2 is cheap. Might be okay to limp. I'd lean to call to see flop because suited king can make top pair or flush. Also being last to act postflop is beneficial.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Board: 2s Kh 7d. Our hand: 6d Kd. So we have top pair (K) with decent kicker (6). Actually board has K, we have Kd, so we have pair of Kings, with K kicker? Actually we have Kd, board K is hearts, so we have a pair of Kings, plus a 6 kicker. Opponent (Seat2) bet 4 into pot 9 (so pot becomes 13 after bet). Stack sizes: we have 195, opponent has 172. Our stack is large relative to bet.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies. We have no info yet. Could be a continuation bet (c-bet) from BB. Preflop: BB (Seat2) checked, we called 2 from BTN, then BB checked. So opponent checked preflop, maybe they have a wide range, maybe they have missed the flop. Board has a King, we have K, they may have missed. They bet 4, maybe they have a piece of the board: maybe they have a King, a 2, a 7, or a draw. Could be a bluff. We have top pair, likely best hand. Should we raise? Consider pot odds: pot 13, bet 4, we can call 4 to win 13+4=17? Actually pot after bet is 13 (9+4). If we call, we invest 4 to win 13 (since opponent's bet is included). So pot odds ~ 4/(13+4?) Wait: pot before call is 13 (includes opponent's bet). If we call 4, total pot we can win is 13, we invest 4, so odds 4:13 ~ 23.5% needed, we have top pair, likely > 50% equity. So call is fine. Raising could extract value if opponent has weaker hand like a lower pair (7,2) or a draw. Minimum raise is 8 (total). Raising to 8 would be a raise of 4 more (total 8). That would be 8 total (including call). That would be a raise of 4 over call. Opponent could call or raise. Could be good for value.\n\nBut we need to consider stack depth: opponent has 172, we have 195. Raising to 8 is small relative to stacks, but could be okay.\n\nWe also consider tournament: we have decent stack 97.5 BB, we can preserve.\n\nGiven we have top pair, we could call and see turn, but raising might be good to protect against draws (2-7 board no straight draws). Actually board: 2-7-K, possible straight draws: 3-4-5-6? Not present. There's a gutshot 3-4-5 for a straight draw? Actually need 4 cards: 2-7-K, you could have 3-4-5 for a straight draw needing 8? No. So no immediate draws. So we can just call.\n\nCheck if opponent is likely to fold to raise? They bet, so they have some strength. Raising could get called by worse hands and also by draws. Might be profitable.\n\nGiven we have top pair, I think raising to 8 is good for value. However we need to consider opponent's range: they could have Kx (maybe they have K9, KQ etc). If they have Kx, they'd have two pair (K K) maybe? Actually board has K, they could have Kx, they'd have top pair as well, but they might have K2 for trips? Actually board K, they have K? That would be two pair? No, board K, they have K, they'd have pair of Kings (same as us). If they have K2, they'd have K with a 2 kicker, we have K6, we are ahead. If they have K7 they'd have K7 (two pair? Actually board has 7, so they'd have K7 = two pair K and 7). That would beat our K6? Yes, K7 > K6. So raising could be risky if opponent has K7. Probability? Not huge.\n\nAlso they could have 7x, giving them pair of 7s, we beat them. They could have 2x, pair of 2s, we beat. Could have a flush draw? No hearts: board hearts only K hearts. We have Kd, not heart. Opponent could have hearts for flush draw? Only one heart on board, need 4 hearts. Not possible.\n\nThus raising is good.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. We'll raise to 8 total.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have UTG with Qd Ks (queen of diamonds, king of spades). Stack 204, blinds 1/2. SB posted 1, BB posted 2. So we face a call of 2 to complete the big blind? Actually amount to call is 2 (big blind). Minimum raise to 4 (so raise to total 4). Need to consider opponent tendencies. We have data: opponent seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop to 6 in hand #2. That's a raise of 6 (to 6 total) which is 3x BB (since BB is 2). So they may be aggressive. But we don't know other data. We have no info on seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) or seat 1. But seat 2 is SB and we are UTG. Our hand QK offsuit (queen king unsuited). That's a decent hand, but from UTG it's strong enough to raise in many games. In tournament with 102 BB stack, we can raise to 4 (2x BB) or maybe bigger. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to total 4). That's a standard raise. Should we raise? QK offsuit is a premium-ish hand, especially UTG. Likely we want to open raise to build pot and isolate. Also consider opponent tendencies: seat 2 has raised previously, maybe they are willing to 3-bet? But we are first to act after SB and BB posted. Actually order: seat 2 is SB posted 1, seat 3 is BB posted 2, seat 4 folded, seat 5 is us UTG? Wait seat numbers: seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat 2 is Kimi-K2, seat 3 DeepSeek-V3.2, seat 4 MiniMax-M2 (folded), seat 5 us. Position UTG seat 5? Usually UTG is first after big blind, but seat numbers may be different. The order: preflop: seat 2 post_sb 1, seat 3 post_bb 2, seat 4 fold, then it's our turn (seat 5). So we are first to act after blinds. So we can raise. Raise to 4 is standard. Should we consider 3-betting? Our stack is deep (102 BB), but typical open raise is 2.5-3 BB. Minimum raise to 4 is 2 BB (since big blind 2). Actually 4 total = 2 BB, which is small. Could we raise to bigger? The legal actions are fold, call, raise, but raise_to we can set any amount >= minimum raise. Probably we can raise more. Should we raise to maybe 6 or 8? Considering seat 2 may be aggressive, but we can open raise to 6 to isolate and protect. However we might want to keep pot manageable. QK offsuit is a strong hand, but from UTG we should be careful. I think raise to 6 (3 BB) is good. But we need to ensure we have enough chips; we have 204, so fine.\n\nWe also have seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) still to act after us? Actually after our action, seat 1 will act (since they are on left of us). They have 205 chips. They may call or raise. So we need to set raise amount that is appropriate. I'd raise to 6.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 6, reasoning: hand strength, position, tournament, etc.\n\n",

Pot currently 28 chips (small blind 1, big blind 2, plus our raise 6? Let's compute: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then seat5 (us) raise to 6 (so we put 6 total, meaning we added 4 more). Then seat2 (UTG?) raises to 20 (so they re-raise). Now amount to call is 14 (since we have 6 in, need to call 20 total, so 14 more). Minimum raise to 34 (i.e., raise by at least 14 more? Actually raise to 34 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Opponent seat2 is Kimi-K2 with 152 chips. We have limited info: we recall a previous raise by Kimi-K2 preflop of 6 in hand #2. Not much else. No further pattern.\n\nOur hand QdKs is decent but not premium. In BB facing a raise from UTG (likely early position) to 20 (10x big blind). That's a 10bb raise. Stack sizes moderate. We have 99 BB stack, deep. QK offsuit? Actually Qd Ks is offsuit (Qd and Ks). That's a decent hand but not a top 10. Usually you would fold to 10bb raise from early position with QK offsuit? Many players would call or 3-bet depending on dynamics. In tournament with 99 BB, you can be a bit aggressive. But we are out of position post-flop. Also the raise is from seat2 (likely UTG). Our position is BB, we are out of position. QK off is a good hand to 3-bet for value and to take initiative. But we need to consider opponent's range: early position raise could be strong: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK, maybe AQ, maybe AJs, maybe KQs, maybe suited connectors. QK off is in that range as a call maybe but also a 3-bet candidate.\n\nWe have 198 chips, opponent 152 chips. So we could 3-bet to 34 (minimum raise). That would be 34 total, meaning we add 28 more chips (since we have 6 already). That would be a raise of 34 total (i.e., 34-20 = 14 extra? Actually minimum raise to 34 means total bet of 34, so we need to put 34 total, we currently have 6, need to add 28. So raise amount = 28 chips more, total 34). That's a 17bb raise (since 34/2). That's a decent size.\n\nAlternatively we could call 14 to see flop. But QK off vs early raise is maybe +EV to call? Let's compute pot odds: pot currently 28 (including blinds and our raise) + opponent's raise 20 (so pot after they raise = 28 + 20? Actually the pot before decision includes all bets: SB 1, BB 2, our raise to 6, opponent raise to 20. So total pot = 1+2+6+20 = 29? Wait we need to sum: SB 1, BB 2, our raise to 6 (so we contributed 6 total, not additional 4?), opponent raise to 20 (so they contributed 20). So total = 1+2+6+20 = 29. But the problem statement says pot: 28 chips. Slight discrepancy maybe they count differently. Anyway pot about 28. If we call 14, pot becomes ~42. So we would be calling 14 into pot 28 => 2:1 odds. So we need to have >33% equity. QK offsuit vs early raise range maybe ~30%? Might be borderline. So a call could be okay if we think we have equity. But raising could also be good to take initiative and maybe win pot preflop.\n\nGiven we have deep stack, we might want to 3-bet to isolate and take control. But we need to consider opponent's tendencies: we have only one prior raise of 6 (small) from them, not informative. Could be a loose player. In early position, small raise 6 (3bb) maybe indicates a wide range. If they raise to 20 now (10bb) maybe they are strong. Actually that is the raise we are facing. So we can't gauge.\n\nGiven tournament stage unknown, but we have decent stack. I think best action: raise to minimum 34 to 3-bet. Reason: QK offsuit is strong enough to 3"

That would be 34 total, meaning we add 28 more chips (since we have 6 already). That would be a raise of 34 total (i.e., 34-20 = 14 extra? Actually minimum raise to 34 means total bet of 34, so we need to put 34 total, we currently have 6, need to add 28. So raise amount = 28 chips more, total 34). That's a 17bb raise (since 34/2). That's a decent size.\n\nAlternatively we could call 14 to see flop. But QK off vs early raise is maybe +EV to call? Let's compute pot odds: pot currently 28 (including blinds and our raise) + opponent's raise 20 (so pot after they raise = 28 + 20? Actually the pot before decision includes all bets: SB 1, BB 2, our raise to 6, opponent raise to 20. So total pot = 1+2+6+20 = 29? Wait we need to sum: SB 1, BB 2, our raise to 6 (so we contributed 6 total, not additional 4?), opponent raise to 20 (so they contributed 20). So total = 1+2+6+20 = 29. But the problem statement says pot: 28 chips. Slight discrepancy maybe they count differently. Anyway pot about 28. If we call 14, pot becomes ~42. So we would be calling 14 into pot 28 => 2:1 odds. So we need to have >33% equity. QK offsuit vs early raise range maybe ~30%? Might be borderline. So a call could be okay if we think we have equity. But raising could also be good to take initiative and maybe win pot preflop.\n\nGiven we have deep stack, we might want to 3-bet to isolate and take control. But we need to consider opponent's tendencies: we have only one prior raise of 6 (small) from them, not informative. Could be a loose player. In early position, small raise 6 (3bb) maybe indicates a wide range. If they raise to 20 now (10bb) maybe they are strong. Actually that is the raise we are facing. So we can't gauge.\n\nGiven tournament stage unknown, but we have decent stack. I think best action: raise to minimum 34 to 3-bet. Reason: QK offsuit is strong enough to 3",

No, Ac9d is offsuit (clubs and diamonds). In SB with 111.5 BB stack, fairly deep. Ac9d is a decent hand but not premium. Considering opponent in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called big blind, likely a decent range maybe wide. In SB we are out of position postflop. Should we raise to isolate? With 111 BB, we could raise to 4 (min raise) to try to steal. But opponent already called, so raising might isolate against a player who likely calls wide. Ac9d is not great for 3-bet; could fold. But also we have good equity vs unknown range. However typical SB play: with A9 off-suit, many would just call or fold. Raising could be okay to try to take pot preflop, but risk of being 3-bet by stronger. Since opponent just called, maybe they have a wide range, so a raise could get folds from weaker. But also we are out of position. I'd likely call to see flop cheaply. So action: call.\n\nLegal: call. So JSON.\n\n",

Board: 6-4-K-7, we have A9, so we have gutshot 8 for straight? Actually need 8 to make 4-5-6-7-8, we don't have 5. So no. Flush draw? Two spades on board (6s,7s) and we have Ac9d, no spade. So no draw. So just Ace high, no pair. Opponent: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 203 chips, currently in BB. Also seat 4 MiniMax-M2 with 205 chips is also in hand? Wait actions: preflop seat4 called 2 (big blind?), seat5 called 1 (SB). So after preflop, we have three players: seat1 (BB) posted 2, seat4 called 2, seat5 called 1. Then flop check each: seat5 check, seat1 check, seat4 check. So all three are still in. Turn now, it's seat5's turn (SB) first? Actually order: after flop, action proceeds from SB? Usually order is SB first preflop, then BB, then UTG etc. On flop, after preflop, action starts with first active player left of button. Since SB is seat5, BB seat1, seat4 is CO? Actually seat4 is maybe UTG? Not needed. So on turn, order continues: seat5 first, then seat1, then seat4. So we have decision.\n\nWe have 6 chips in pot (very small). Stack 222. No bet, amount to call 0. Options: check or raise. With Ace high, likely not worth raising. But could try steal? Opponent stacks are similar, but they have checked flop, maybe they have weak. But raising with Ace high is risky, could be called and we lose.\n\nConsider tournament stage: unknown but stack 111 BB, deep. Probably better to check and see river.\n\nThus choose check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. Choose check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "content": "We have a hand: Turn, we are BB (seat5) with Ac 9d. Board: 6s 4c Ks 7s. So board: 6\u2660 4\u2663 K\u2660 7\u2660. We have Ace of clubs and 9 of diamonds. Our hand: Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: board has 6,4,K,7. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9? Actually we have 9, board 6,7,? 8 missing, 5 missing. So we have a gutshot: need 8 to make 6-7-8-9-10? Wait 6-7-8-9-10 would need 8 and 10. Not correct. Let's compute possible draws: With 9, we could have a straight 5-6-7-8-9 (need 5 and 8). Not present. So not immediate. Also we have Ace high, no pair. We have a backdoor flush? Board has two spades (6\u2660,7\u2660). We have no spade, so no flush draw. So basically we have Ace high, no draw. Opponent (Seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking) bet 10 on turn. Pot before bet: 16 chips (pre-turn). Actually after flop check, pot still 16? Let's compute: Preflop: blinds 1/2, pot 3 (1+2). Then seat4 called 2, seat5 called 1 (makes total 1+2+2+1 =6?). Wait preflop: seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2, seat4 call 2 (that's a raise? Actually seat4 is in UTG? but they called 2). seat5 call 1 (completes small blind). So pot after preflop: 1+2+2+1 =6. Then flop: all check, pot remains 6. Turn: seat5 check, seat1 bet 10, seat4 fold. So pot before bet: 6. After bet 10, pot becomes 16 (6+10). The amount to call is 10, pot after call would be 26 (if we call). So pot odds: 10 to call, pot 16 (plus our call 10 => 26). So we need 10/26 = 38.5% equity to call break even. Our hand Ace high vs opponent's range. Opponent's betting pattern: Turn bet 10 after board 6s 4c Ks 7s. He could have a variety: maybe a pair (Kx, 6,7), or a draw (flush draw? but board has two spades; opponent could have spade). He could also have Ace high but maybe slower. He bet 10 which is 5 BB (since BB=2). That's a relatively big bet (5 BB) on turn after checking flop. Could be a value bet with Kx or a semi-bluff with spade draw? But there are two spades on board, so a spade draw would be a gutshot? Actually need 2 spades to make flush: board has 2 spades, need 2 more spades in hand (both spades) for a made flush. Opponent could have a spade flush draw with one spade? Actually to have a flush draw, need 4 spades total (3 on board + 1 in hand) for a draw (i.e., have one spade, board has 3 spades). But board only has 2 spades, so a flush draw needs 2 spades in hand (i.e., a \"double suited\" hand). That's less common. So likely not a flush draw.\n\nThus opponent likely has a hand like Kx, 6x, 7x, maybe 8-9 for straight draw? Board: 6-4-K-7. Straight draws: open-ended? 5-6-7-8-9: need 5 and 8.

          "reasoning_content": "We have a hand: Turn, we are BB (seat5) with Ac 9d. Board: 6s 4c Ks 7s. So board: 6\u2660 4\u2663 K\u2660 7\u2660. We have Ace of clubs and 9 of diamonds. Our hand: Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: board has 6,4,K,7. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9? Actually we have 9, board 6,7,? 8 missing, 5 missing. So we have a gutshot: need 8 to make 6-7-8-9-10? Wait 6-7-8-9-10 would need 8 and 10. Not correct. Let's compute possible draws: With 9, we could have a straight 5-6-7-8-9 (need 5 and 8). Not present. So not immediate. Also we have Ace high, no pair. We have a backdoor flush? Board has two spades (6\u2660,7\u2660). We have no spade, so no flush draw. So basically we have Ace high, no draw. Opponent (Seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking) bet 10 on turn. Pot before bet: 16 chips (pre-turn). Actually after flop check, pot still 16? Let's compute: Preflop: blinds 1/2, pot 3 (1+2). Then seat4 called 2, seat5 called 1 (makes total 1+2+2+1 =6?). Wait preflop: seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2, seat4 call 2 (that's a raise? Actually seat4 is in UTG? but they called 2). seat5 call 1 (completes small blind). So pot after preflop: 1+2+2+1 =6. Then flop: all check, pot remains 6. Turn: seat5 check, seat1 bet 10, seat4 fold. So pot before bet: 6. After bet 10, pot becomes 16 (6+10). The amount to call is 10, pot after call would be 26 (if we call). So pot odds: 10 to call, pot 16 (plus our call 10 => 26). So we need 10/26 = 38.5% equity to call break even. Our hand Ace high vs opponent's range. Opponent's betting pattern: Turn bet 10 after board 6s 4c Ks 7s. He could have a variety: maybe a pair (Kx, 6,7), or a draw (flush draw? but board has two spades; opponent could have spade). He could also have Ace high but maybe slower. He bet 10 which is 5 BB (since BB=2). That's a relatively big bet (5 BB) on turn after checking flop. Could be a value bet with Kx or a semi-bluff with spade draw? But there are two spades on board, so a spade draw would be a gutshot? Actually need 2 spades to make flush: board has 2 spades, need 2 more spades in hand (both spades) for a made flush. Opponent could have a spade flush draw with one spade? Actually to have a flush draw, need 4 spades total (3 on board + 1 in hand) for a draw (i.e., have one spade, board has 3 spades). But board only has 2 spades, so a flush draw needs 2 spades in hand (i.e., a \"double suited\" hand). That's less common. So likely not a flush draw.\n\nThus opponent likely has a hand like Kx, 6x, 7x, maybe 8-9 for straight draw? Board: 6-4-K-7. Straight draws: open-ended? 5-6-7-8-9: need 5 and 8. Not there. 6-7-8-9-10: need 8 and 10. Not there. So no immediate draws.\n\nThus opponent probably bets with a made hand (pair, two pair, set) or a bluff. Let's consider his range: He could have Kx (top pair) maybe with kicker. Could also have 6x or 7x (middle pair). Could have 4x (pair). Could have a straight draw like 8-9? Actually 8-9 would give open-ended? 6-7-8-9-10 not there. So no.\n\nThus our Ace high is likely losing. So folding is appropriate.\n\nBut we also need to consider stack sizes: we have 222",

However stack deep 111 BB, so can raise larger.\n\nOpponent tendencies: seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop in two recent hands to 8 (from small blind) likely a raise of 8 (4x BB). That suggests they are willing to raise larger. Seat2 (Kimi-K2) is big blind; unknown.\n\nWe are on button, can either call or raise. In tournament, with 111 BB, can be aggressive. K7o is a marginal hand; many players would raise from button with it, but also can call to see flop cheap. Since we have position, can open raise to maybe 6-8 chips (3-4 BB) to isolate. But we need to consider opponent's likely response: if we raise, seat1 (SB) may 3-bet? They have been raising to 8 (maybe 4x). If we raise to 6, they could 3-bet to 16? Not sure. Our stack is deep; but we risk playing a marginal hand out of position? Actually we have position.\n\nGiven we are button with K7o, typical open raise size is 2.5-3 BB (5-6 chips). Minimum raise is 4 total, which is 2 BB. That's too small; better raise to 6. That is 3 BB total.\n\nWe also consider that we have 111 BB, we can afford a raise. I think raise to 6 chips.\n\nReason: we want to apply pressure, take pot, have position, and our hand has decent equity vs random hands.

We have king high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: board 6, A,3. Straight possibilities: 4-5-6-7-8? Not. We have 7, so we have 7,6,? need 5,4 for straight, not present. 7 also could be part of A-2-3-4-5? No. So no straight draw. Flush draw? We have hearts 7h, board hearts: 3h only, so need two more hearts. No flush draw. So we have just king high, no pair. Opponent checked. Likely weak or also missed. Could be they have Ace (maybe they have Ace, something). Could be they have 6x for pair, or a draw like 5-4 for straight draw? Actually 5-4 would give open-ended straight draw (4-5-6-7-8) but need 8 or 2? Wait board 6 A 3. With 5-4, you have 4-5-6, need 2 or 7 for straight. Not immediate. So not typical.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, but we are in position, we could check to see if they bet later. Raising could be a bluff to steal pot (14). Minimum raise 4 => raise to 4 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call 0, raise to 4 means we put 4 chips in. That would be a 4 chip bet, pot becomes 18. Opponent may call with weak hands. Is that a good bluff? Our stack is 216 chips, deep. Opponent stack 203. They are shortish but still decent. They checked. Could be they have Ace high, maybe they will check-turn as well. Might be okay to check and see if they bet later.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: stack sizes moderate, 108 BB. Not huge. Should preserve chips. With king high, we probably should check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

We have K7, so currently we have top pair? No, we have no pair. We have a gutshot straight draw? The board has A, T, 6, 3. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q? Not relevant. 7 would give us a straight if 8 and 9 appear? Actually need 8-9 to make 6-7-8-9-10? We have 7, board 6 and T, need 8 and 9. Not a straight draw. Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? We have 7h, board has 3h, so one heart, need two more hearts on river. Not strong.\n\nOpponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking. He bet 10 into pot 24 on turn. So pot before bet 24, his bet 10 makes pot 34 if called. He bet relatively small (about 0.4 pot). Could be a continuation bet, maybe a weak hand or a draw. He checked flop. Preflop he called our raise 6 after we raised from BB? Actually we raised to 6, he called 5 (so put 6 total). Preflop pot after raise: 1+2+6+5 =14? Actually SB 1, BB 2, us raise 6 (so we put 6), he call 5 (since he already posted 2 blind? Wait seat1 is SB, posted 1, then call 5 to match 6 total, so he adds 5). So pot after preflop: SB 1+5 =6, BB 2, us 6 = total 14? plus maybe? Actually pot = 1+2+6+5 =14. Flop: check-check, pot remains 14. Turn: he bets 10, so pot becomes 24 (14+10). Wait given pot is 24 before his bet? The description says Pot: 24 chips before turn? Actually the hand summary says Pot: 24 chips at start of turn. Then he bets 10, amount to call 10. So pot after bet would be 34. So his bet is less than half pot (10 into 24). That's a small bet.\n\nOur stack 216, we have 206 after our raise? Actually we have 216 total, we put 6 preflop, so 210 left. He called 5, so his stack now 188? Not needed.\n\nWe need to decide fold, call, raise. Our hand K7 offsuit, no pair, no draw. Likely we should fold. But we might consider call if we think he is weak and we could bluff later? But we have no equity. The turn bet could be a continuation bet with Ace, Ten, maybe a pair of Ace, Ten, etc. We have no showdown value.\n\nThus best is fold.\n\nWe can also recall opponent tendencies: we have recall of previous turn bet of 10. That previous hand maybe similar? But we just got that info. Not enough.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have 9h9c in BB, stack 197. Already posted 4. Opponent seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 36 after our raise to 12. So action order: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, we (BB) raised to 12 (so added 8 more). Then seat1 (UTG? Actually seat1 is after BB? In order: seats 1-5? But we have seat5 BB, seat1 is to our left? Anyway they raised to 36 (so total 36). So amount to call is 24 (36-12). Minimum raise to 60 (i.e., raise by at least 24 more). We have 9s, a pocket pair, decent but not premium. Stack 197, effective stack after posting? Our remaining stack after initial raise: we have 197 total, we posted 4 and raised to 12, meaning we put total 12, leaving 185. Opponent's stack is 184. So effective stack ~185.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking's raise sizes: earlier raises 8, 8, 12 (small). This time they raised to 36 (big). Might indicate stronger hand? But they could be raising wide.\n\nWe have a medium pair, could consider 3-betting or just call. With 49 BB, we can afford a 3-bet. A 3-bet to 60 would be 48 more (since we already have 12 in). That would be a sizable raise, maybe isolate.\n\nGiven we are in BB, we have position disadvantage postflop (out of position vs UTG). 9s is vulnerable to overcards. Might want to call and see flop, but risk being dominated.\n\nPot odds: call 24 into pot 54+24? Actually current pot 54 (includes our raise 12 and opponent's raise to 36? Let's compute: initial pot: SB 2 + BB 4 =6. Our raise to 12 adds 8 more (we put 12 total). So pot becomes 6+12=18. Then opponent raises to 36, adds 24 more (they put 36 total). So pot now 18+24=42? Wait also includes opponent's previous 2? Actually they posted 2? No they are seat1 maybe not blind. So pot after their raise: previous pot 18 + opponent's additional 24 = 42. Plus our 12 already in pot. So total pot before our decision is 42? But also includes opponent's 36 total and our 12 total and blinds 6. So 42. To call 24, pot becomes 66. So pot odds = 24/66 = 0.363 ~ 36% needed to break even. Pair 9s vs random? Equity maybe around 55% vs random? Actually vs random hand, pocket pair ~55% preflop. So call is profitable.\n\nBut opponent may have range narrower (they raised big). Might be strong. But still 9s is okay.\n\nConsider tournament: 49 BB is decent, we can preserve.\n\nThus likely call.\n\nWe could also 3-bet to isolate, but risk bigger pot.\n\nI will call.\n\n",

Others folded. We called 24 to see flop. So pot now 78 (includes blinds 2+4 + our 12 + his 36? Let's compute: SB 2, BB 4, we raised to 12 (so we added 8 more?), Actually we posted SB 2? Wait seat3 posted sb 2, seat4 posted bb 4. That's weird: seat3 is SB, seat4 is BB, but we are seat5 also BB? The structure: maybe seat3 is SB, seat4 is BB, seat5 is us in BB? Actually we are BB seat5, but they posted sb and bb earlier seats. Might be mislabel. Anyway pot 78. Board: 6d Ad 4c. We have pocket 9s, no pair on board. Overcards: Ace on board, we have no Ace, so we are behind any Ace. We have middle pair? Actually we have 9s, board 6, A, 4. So we have a gutshot? Straight draws? 9 with board 6, A,4: we need 5 or 7 for straight? 5 gives 4-5-6-? Actually 4-5-6-? need 7? Not. 7 gives 4-5-6-7? No 5 missing. So no immediate draws. So we have just a medium pair (9s) which is currently best hand? Actually opponent's range: they raised preflop to 36 (3BB) and we called. That is a 3-bet? Actually initial raise to 12 by us, then seat1 re-raised to 36 (3-bet). So they 3-bet us. So they have strong range: broadways, Aces, maybe 9s, etc. On flop Ace high, they likely have Ace or strong combos. Our 9s are likely behind. We have only overpair to board? Actually board has 6, A,4. Our 9s are just a pair, not overpair (overpair would be >A). So we are likely losing. Should we check? Opponent's action? No action yet on flop; we are first to act? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking. The flop action order: starting from UTG? Usually action starts with first active left of button. Button is seat? Not given. But we are BB, seat5. Seat1 is earlier seat (maybe UTG). So seat1 likely acts first. But we have no action yet. The legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. Raising might be a bluff. But we have small stack 173 chips (43 BB). Pot 78. Raising could be a semi-bluff attempt to steal pot if opponent is weak. But opponent likely strong. So best is check and hope they check behind. If they bet, we can consider folding. So choose check.\n\nThus JSON: action check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

A raise would be a bluff without blockers to the Ace, and the opponent may call with better hands. Folding preserves our stack.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with pocket 9s. Board: 6d Ad 4c. Opponent (Seat1) bet 50 into pot 128. So pot before bet? Preflop pot: blinds 2+4 =6 + raise 12+36? Actually preflop: BB raised to 12, then Seat1 raise to 36 (i.e., 3-bet). Then BB called 24 (to match 36). So pot after preflop: 2+4+12+36+24? Let's compute: initial blinds 2 (SB) +4 (BB). Then BB raise to 12 (adds 8 more). Then Seat1 raise to 36 (adds 24 more). Then BB call 24 (adds 24). So total = 2+4+12+36+24 = 78. Wait also SB posted 2 (Seat3) but they folded preflop, still part of pot. So pot = 78. Flop: BB checked, Seat1 bets 50. So pot now 128 (as given). Good.\n\nOur hand: pocket 9s, board: A6 4. No pair, no straight draw (9 doesn't help). Overcards: Ace on board, we have no Ace, so we are behind any Ace. Potential: could improve on turn/river to a set (unlikely) or two pair if a 9 appears (but board has no 9). Also could make straight with 7-8? Actually board 6- A -4, we have 9, need 7-8 for straight? 6-7-8-9-10? Not possible because board has A, not 10. So no.\n\nThus hand is weak. Opponent likely continuation bet. We have 9s vs unknown range. Our stack 173, opponent 134. Pot 128, bet 50, we need to call 50 to see turn. Pot odds: call 50 to win 178 (128+50). So odds 50/178 \u2248 28% required. Our hand equity vs typical continuation range? Probably less than 20%. So fold.\n\nBut consider opponent may be weak, maybe we could raise as bluff? Our hand is not strong, but we could represent a strong hand like A or set. However raising to 100 minimum raise is possible. But we have 43 BB, still decent stack. However opponent has 134 chips, shortish. A raise could push them off and win pot. But risk: if they call, we are likely behind. Could be a good bluff if opponent is tight and folds to raise. But we have no blockers to A; they have A on board, could have Ace. Our 9s not blockers. So maybe not good.\n\nGiven we are out of position (BB vs Seat1 maybe in early position? Seat1 is UTG? Not sure). Usually with pocket pair low on board with overcards, you fold to c-bet.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Let's compute: preflop contributions: SB 2, BB 4, seat4 called 2, seat5 checked, so pot = 2+4+2+0 =8? Wait plus blinds? Actually blinds are part of pot: SB 2, BB 4, plus call 2 from seat4 = 2, plus seat5 check 0, total 8. But given pot is 12 chips on flop, maybe there were antes? But ignore. They bet 4, making pot 16 after bet? Actually amount to call is 4.\n\nOur stack 169, we have 42 BB. We need decide to call, raise, or fold. Hand strength is weak. Opponent's bet size is small (half pot). Could be continuation bet with many hands. We have a pair of 4s, but board has Qc, 7c, 4c. Opponent could have Qx, 7x, 4x, flush draw, etc. Our pair is low. Likely fold.\n\nBut consider if opponent is short stack 193 chips, maybe they are trying to steal? Not sure. Check opponent tendencies: we have recall of two previous flop bets: hand 1 bet 8 (bigger) and hand 19 bet 2 (small). So variable. No pattern.\n\nThus fold seems appropriate.\n\nReturn JSON.",

The action: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, then we have to call 4 to see flop. No raises yet. So we can call 4 (1 BB). Hand Kh5 suited. It's a weak hand but suited, could be okay in BTN with 41 BB. But we need consider tournament stage. Stack 167 chips, 41 BB, decent. Should we raise? Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to total 8). Could raise to steal blinds. Opponents have decent stacks, but SB only 256 (15 BB). BB 154 (38 BB). They might defend. Kh5 is not a strong raise hand. Might just call and see flop. But we could also raise as a steal attempt. However Kh5 is not premium, but in BTN you can raise with a wide range. Yet you have to consider that SB is shortish? 256 chips is still decent. But they posted 2, so they might call or raise. Raising could get us in a big pot with a marginal hand. Better to call and see flop, maybe fold later. So call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. We'll choose call.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

That's a flush already on board (four spades). We have hearts, not spades, so no flush draw. We have pair of Kings (top pair) with a gutshot? Not relevant. Opponent seat2 has stack 154, we have 163. Pot is 10 chips only? That's weird: preflop small blind 2, big blind 4, we called 4, so pot after preflop is 2+4+4 =10. Flop no betting, turn no betting, so still 10. So we are on turn, amount to call 0, minimum raise 4. Should we bet? Consider opponent's tendencies. We have top pair K, but board is very coordinated: four spades, possible straight draws? Board: K s, 2 s, 8 s, 6 s. Straight possibilities: 9-7? Not there. Could be 7-5 for a straight (7,5). Opponent could have flush (any spade) already on board. If opponent has spade, they have a flush (since board has four spades, any spade gives them nut flush? Actually board: Ks, 2s, 8s, 6s. The highest spade on board is K. So any spade lower than K gives them a flush, but not nut? The nut flush would be Ace of spades, which beats any other spade. So opponent could have A\u2660 for nut flush. Also any spade gives a flush, which beats our pair. So opponent may have a flush, or could have a straight? Not likely.\n\nOur hand is relatively weak relative to board. We might consider checking and folding to later bets. But we have position and can try to steal pot. However opponent may have a flush and could raise. Our stack is 163, pot 10. We could raise to 4 (minimum) to try to take pot. But risk: if opponent has flush, they'd raise or call? They might call with weak spade? They might have a hand like A\u2660, they would likely raise. So raising may get us called by a flush and we lose more chips. Better to check and see if opponent bets; we can fold if they bet.\n\nGiven our hand is vulnerable, check is safe. Also we have some showdown value if opponent checks again; we could win the pot at showdown with K pair vs maybe opponent's missed draws. But opponent could have a hand like A\u2663 A\u2666? Actually they could have pocket Aces but board has K high, they have pair of A's, still behind our K? Actually K vs A? Aces would be higher pair, they'd be ahead. So many hands beat us.\n\nThus best is check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We choose check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Their stack 154 chips, they are in BB. They checked all streets, likely they have a weak hand or maybe a draw they missed. Could have a straight? Board: K 2 8 6 8. Possible combos: they could have 8x for trips, or a full house (8-8-8? Actually board has pair of 8s, so a full house would be 8-8-8-K-K? No, board already has pair 8s, one K. If they have Kx they'd have trips K? Actually board has one K, so they could have Kx for pair of Kings (we have same). They could have 8x for trips 8s (but board has two 8s, they need third 8 for trips). There is only one 8 left (8c on board). Actually board has 8s and 8c, that's two 8s. So they could have 8d? Actually there are three 8s total? No, deck has four suits, we have 8s and 8c on board, so remaining 8h and 8d are possible. If they have an 8, they'd have trips (three of a kind). Could also have a straight? Board: K 2 8 6 8. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9? Not possible. 4-5-6-7-8? No 7 missing. So no straight.\n\nFlush: board has four spades (Ks, 2s, 8s, 6s). Actually that's four spades, plus 8c. So any spade in hand gives a flush. We have Kh 5h, no spade. Opponent could have a spade for flush. They checked river, maybe they missed flush draw. Could have a lower flush but they'd likely bet. They could have a full house: K K 8 8 8? Not possible because only one K left (Kc, Kd). If they have Kc they'd have two pair K K and 8 8? Actually board K, we have Kc gives pair of Kings, plus board pair of 8s, that is two pair (K's and 8's). Not full house. Full house would need K K K 8 8 or 8 8 8 K K. Not possible.\n\nSo our hand is top pair K with weak kicker, but board is very coordinated flush heavy. Opponent checked, likely they have nothing. We could check and win. Raising may be a bluff, but opponent might call with a weak hand? They checked all streets, likely they have nothing, maybe a missed draw, maybe a weak pair like 2-2,6-6, etc. Could they have a hand like 8h (makes trips)? If they have 8h they'd have trips, they'd likely bet river. So they probably don't have 8. Could they have Kx? They might have Kc, they'd have two pair (K's and 8's). They might check? Usually they'd bet. So likely they have nothing. So we can check and win. But we could also consider a value bet? But we have only top pair K, not strong vs potential flush. If we bet, they might call with any pair (like 2-2,6-6,8-8? but they'd have 8 they'd bet). Could they call with a lower pair? Maybe they have 6-6 or 2-2, they'd call? They might fold to a bet. But we risk losing chips if they have a flush (they would have folded earlier). So checking is safe.\n\nThus action: check."

Could also have a straight? Board: K 2 8 6 8. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9? Not possible. 4-5-6-7-8? No 7 missing. So no straight.\n\nFlush: board has four spades (Ks, 2s, 8s, 6s). Actually that's four spades, plus 8c. So any spade in hand gives a flush. We have Kh 5h, no spade. Opponent could have a spade for flush. They checked river, maybe they missed flush draw. Could have a lower flush but they'd likely bet. They could have a full house: K K 8 8 8? Not possible because only one K left (Kc, Kd). If they have Kc they'd have two pair K K and 8 8? Actually board K, we have Kc gives pair of Kings, plus board pair of 8s, that is two pair (K's and 8's). Not full house. Full house would need K K K 8 8 or 8 8 8 K K. Not possible.\n\nSo our hand is top pair K with weak kicker, but board is very coordinated flush heavy. Opponent checked, likely they have nothing. We could check and win. Raising may be a bluff, but opponent might call with a weak hand? They checked all streets, likely they have nothing, maybe a missed draw, maybe a weak pair like 2-2,6-6, etc. Could they have a hand like 8h (makes trips)? If they have 8h they'd have trips, they'd likely bet river. So they probably don't have 8. Could they have Kx? They might have Kc, they'd have two pair (K's and 8's). They might check? Usually they'd bet. So likely they have nothing. So we can check and win. But we could also consider a value bet? But we have only top pair K, not strong vs potential flush. If we bet, they might call with any pair (like 2-2,6-6,8-8? but they'd have 8 they'd bet). Could they call with a lower pair? Maybe they have 6-6 or 2-2, they'd call? They might fold to a bet. But we risk losing chips if they have a flush (they would have folded earlier). So checking is safe.\n\nThus action: check.",

With 43 BB, you could limp? But legal actions are fold/call/raise, not check. So you could call 4, see flop, but out of position. Might be okay to limp and see flop cheaply, but risk being raised.

Actions: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, others folded, BB called 2 (so we just called SB), then Seat1 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (i.e., 12 total, so raise of 8 over our 4? Actually amount to call is 8, min raise to 20). So we face a raise to 12, we need to call 8 more (to match 12). Opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking is seat1, presumably UTG? Actually seat1 is maybe dealer? But irrelevant.\n\nWe need to decide fold, call, raise. Hand Ks5 offsuit. In BB vs a raise from opponent (likely early position?), we need to consider stack depth 42.8 BB, raise to 12 is 3BB (since big blind 4). That's 3BB raise. So pot after raise: 4 (BB) + 2 (SB) + 2 (call) + 12 (raise) = 20? Actually we have called 2 to match SB, so we have 4 (BB) + 2 (SB) + 2 (our call) = 8 in pot before raise. Then opponent raises to 12, adding 8 more, pot becomes 16? Wait original pot listed 16 before raise? The hand info says Pot: 16 chips before actions? Actually they list pot after blinds posted maybe 6? Not sure. Anyway.\n\nKs5 is a weak hand. In BB, against a raise, typical folding range is wide. Ks5 offsuit is not a strong hand; it's a king but weak kicker. Could consider calling if opponent is very loose and raise size small, but 3BB raise is standard. With 42 BB stack, calling would be about 2 BB effective, giving us ~5:1 pot odds? Let's compute: To call 8 chips, pot currently (including opponent's raise?) Let's compute after raise: pot = BB 4 + SB 2 + our call 2 + opponent raise 12 = 20. To call 8 more, total pot after call would be 20 + 8 = 28. So pot odds = 8 / 28 = 0.285, about 28.5% needed. Our hand equity vs random? Ks5 offsuit vs unknown range maybe ~15%? Not enough. So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: recall shows they raised 12 (3BB) in hand 21, also raised 8 earlier (2BB) and 36 (9BB). So they vary. But not extremely tight. So folding is safe.\n\nThus output JSON with fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have flop 5c 9c 6d. Our hand Ad 3d gives us a flush draw (diamonds) with Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Board: 5-6-9, we have 3, so open-ended? Actually we have 3, need 4-5-6-7-8? We have 3, board 5-6-9, we could make a straight with 4-5-6-7? Not. We have 3, need 4-5-6-7? Not possible. So only flush draw. Also we have Ace high, maybe a pair of Aces on board? No Aces on board.\n\nWe are on BTN, after flop seat 1 (SB) bet 8 into pot 28, seat2 (BB) called 8, now it's our turn. Stack 167, pot currently 28 + 8+8 =44? Actually pot before bet: 28. SB bet 8 => pot 36, BB called 8 => pot 44, we need call 8. Minimum raise to 16 (so raise to 16 total? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in, so raise to 16 means add 8 more? Wait min raise to: 16 means total bet after raise is 16, which is 8 more than current bet of 8? Actually current bet is 8, so raise to 16 means add 8 more. So raise amount 8.\n\nOur hand: Ace-high flush draw (9 outs? Actually diamonds: we have Ad, 3d. Board diamonds: none. So 13-2 =11 diamonds left. But Ace already in hand, so remaining diamonds 11. But two of those are the 3d? Actually we have 3d, so remaining diamonds are 11 (including Ace? No Ace we have). So 11 outs. Pot odds: call 8 to win 44+8 =52? Actually if we call 8, pot becomes 52, we need to call 8, so odds = 8/(52) = 15.4% required. Flush draw equity ~ (11 outs * 2) = 22% on turn+river, but we only have two streets left. Approx probability to hit flush by river = 1 - ((45/47)*(44/46)) ~? Let's compute: after flop, deck 52-3 board -2 hand =47 cards unknown. Probability hit flush by river = 1 - ( (47-11)/47 * (46-11)/46 ) = 1 - (36/47 * 35/46) = 1 - (0.766 * 0.761) = 1 - 0.583 = 0.417 ~41.7%. So call is profitable. Also we have Ace high, could win if opponent doesn't have better. Opponent likely has a pair or draws. Their bet size is small 8 into 28 (pot 28). Could be a continuation bet with many hands.\n\nWe could also raise to protect and build pot. But our stack is 167, we have room. Minimum raise to 16 is small. Raising may fold out some draws but also increase pot. With 41% equity, raising to 16 (adding 8) yields pot after raise: we add 8, pot becomes 60? Actually currently pot 44, we raise to 16 (so we put in total 16, which includes the 8 call + 8 extra). So we add extra 8, making pot 52 (call) +8 =60? Wait: after SB bet 8, BB called 8, pot 44. If we raise to 16, we need to put in 16 total (i.e., 8 call + 8 raise). So we add 8 more, making pot 44+16 =60. Opponent then can call 8 more (to match 16). So we are building pot.\n\nGiven we have good equity, raising is okay. But also consider position: we are last to act, we could just call to see turn cheap. Opponent's bet is small, maybe they are weak. Raising could scare them away and we win pot uncontested. But we want chips, not necessarily to win small pot.\n\nGiven tournament, stack 41.8 BB, not huge but decent. I think call is fine.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. I'd call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have some data: Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat1) has bet on turn in recent hands (10). No data for Kimi-K2 (seat2). So seat1 tends to bet on turn. In this hand they checked, maybe they have a weak hand or trap.\n\nOur hand: Ace high with flush draw. Turn card unknown? The turn card is Kd? Actually board: 5c 9c 6d Kd. That's the turn? Wait board shows 4 cards, so turn is Kd. So turn is a king of diamonds, giving us four diamonds and also a paired king on board (pair of kings). So board now: 5c 9c 6d Kd (king of diamonds). Actually we have Kd on board, we have no king. So there is a pair of kings on board? Only one king on board. So currently no pair on board except Kd. So we have Ace high.\n\nPotential opponent holdings: Could have king, could have flush draw, could have straight draw, could have pair like 9, 5, 6, etc.\n\nWe are in position, both opponents checked. We could check and see river, or we could raise to apply pressure, maybe represent a king or a flush draw, or a strong hand.\n\nStack sizes: We have 159 chips, pot 36. Effective stack for us vs each opponent: seat1 248, seat2 146. So we are short relative to seat1 but bigger than seat2. Raising to 8 minimum would be small, maybe raise to 12? Minimum raise is 8 (to total 8?). Actually current bet is 0, so raise to at least 8 chips. That would be a small raise, about 0.22 BB? Actually 8 chips is 2 BB (since BB 4). So raise to 8 is 2 BB.\n\nWe could raise to 8 (just meet minimum) as a continuation bet to try to steal pot. Since we have a draw, we might want to get value if they call with worse hands.\n\nConsider pot odds: If we call a bet on river (if we raise now and they call) we need to think about equity. But maybe we want to bet now to protect against draws? Opponents may have flush draws? Actually board has two diamonds, they could have two diamonds for flush draw (needs two more diamonds). They could have Ace of diamonds? We have Ace of diamonds, so they cannot have Ace of diamonds. They could have 2d,4d,7d,8d,10d,Jd,Qd for flush draw. So they could have flush draws.\n\nRaising now could be good to charge draws.\n\nGiven opponent seat1 has a tendency to bet on turn, but they checked this time, maybe they have a weak hand and are checking to see. We could raise to apply pressure. Seat2 unknown.\n\nI think raising to 12 (total) would be decent. But min raise is 8, we could raise to 12 to make it a bit bigger.\n\nCheck? If we check, we give free river to opponents. If they have a pair like K, they could bet. Might be okay.\n\nGiven we have decent draw and some equity, I think a small raise is good to protect and get value. So action: raise to 12.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

So UTG acts next. Amount to call is 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: seat2 (Kimi-K2) raises preflop sometimes; from recall, they raised amounts 6, 12, 20. They are somewhat aggressive, maybe raise with a wide range? Not sure. Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) posted BB, unknown.\n\nOur hand T\u2665 Q\u2666 is suited? No, hearts vs diamonds, not suited. So it's offsuit.\n\nIn UTG, Q T offsuit is marginal. In deep stacks, you could consider a raise to isolate, but many players would 3-bet with stronger. With 48 BB, you could open raise to 12-16 BB? Actually typical raise is 2.5-3 BB, so 8-12 chips. Minimum raise is 8, which is 2 BB (since big blind is 4). That's a small raise, but could be used as a \"limp\" call? Actually calling 4 chips is a limp. That would be a limp with Q T offsuit UTG, which is not advisable.\n\nBetter to raise to 12 (3 BB) to thin the field. But we need to see if we have raise action legal? Yes.\n\nGiven opponent tendencies: seat2 sometimes raises preflop, but they are after us? Actually seat2 is SB, after us. If we raise, they might 3-bet or call. Seat3 (BB) may also call or 3-bet.\n\nGiven tournament stage unknown, but we have decent stack.\n\nThus I think raise to 12 (total) is appropriate.\n\nReasoning: hand is decent but not premium, UTG position, want to thin field, avoid limping.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

Also we have overcards Q and T. Opponent(s) on flop: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) checked. Seat 1 called preflop and is still in? Actually seat 1 called preflop, but we have only seat 2's action listed; maybe seat 1 is also in but hasn't acted yet? The flop actions list only Seat 2 check. Probably seat 1 is next to act, but not listed? The legal actions are for us (BB). The pot is 40 chips. Our stack 183. We are first to act? Actually seat order: after flop, action starts with UTG? The flop order is from left of button? In BB, after flop, the first to act is UTG (Seat 1 maybe). But seat 2 checked, maybe seat 1 already acted? Actually seat 2 is Kimi-K2, seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (maybe same player). The seat numbers: seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking - 236 chips (maybe the player is thinking). seat2 is Kimi-K2 - 134 chips. So seat1 is the one who called preflop (call 12). seat2 is SB who posted 2 and called preflop. So flop order: first to act is seat1 (UTG?), then seat2, then us (BB). But seat2 check is listed, meaning seat1 must have acted before seat2. But not shown. Possibly seat1 checked as well, but not listed. The legal actions for us: fold, check, raise. So we can check or raise.\n\nOur hand: Th Qd. Board: 4d 2d 4h. We have backdoor flush draw (needs two more diamonds). Also we have gutshot? Not really. Pair of 4s on board; we have no pair. Potential for overpair? No. So hand is weak. However opponent may have a hand like 44 (full house), or a set of 2? Actually board has pair of 4s; possible opponent could have 4x for set, or a 2 for trips? Actually only one 2 on board, so 2x would be two pair? If opponent holds 2? they'd have two pair (2s and 4s). Or could have flush draw with diamonds. Could have straight draws? Board 4-2-4, not many.\n\nOur best line likely is to check and see a turn, maybe try a small raise if we think opponent is weak? But we have only backdoor draws; not strong enough to raise. Checking is safe.\n\nConsider stack sizes: opponent seat2 has 134 chips, seat1 has 236. Our stack 183. Pot 40. If we check and opponent bets later, we can decide.\n\nThus choose check.\n\nWe must output JSON with action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Also seat4 (MiniMax-M2) posted BB, but hasn't acted yet. The action: we are UTG, after SB and BB posted, it's our turn to act. Amount to call is 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have 8-8. In early position, typical raise to 2.5-3 BB (8-12). With 45 BB, can raise. Should we raise? Consider tournament stage: stack 45 BB, still decent. Raising is standard. Potential opponents: seat3 (DeepSeek) maybe raises later, but they are later seats. If we raise, we might get 3-bet later. But 8-8 is decent for a raise.\n\nCheck: not allowed because amount to call is 4 (a bet). So we must fold, call, or raise.\n\nCall: just call 4, see flop out of position. Not ideal with medium pair UTG.\n\nRaise: standard. Could raise to 12 (3 BB) or minimum 8 (2 BB). Minimum raise is 8 total (i.e., 4 to call + 4 extra). That is 2 BB. Usually raise to 3 BB (12). But we must ensure it's legal: raise to any amount >= min raise and <= stack. So we can raise to 12.\n\nGiven we have 45 BB, raising to 12 is fine. Reason: we want to thin the field and build pot with a decent pair. Also we have no reads that opponents are tight; they have raised small amounts previously.\n\nThus action: raise to 12.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

No, board has two 3s, if they have a 3, they'd have three 3s (trips) plus board pair 3s? Actually board already has pair 3s, if they have a 3 they'd have three of a kind 3s (set).

If opponent has T?, they'd have set of tens. If they have 8?, they'd have full house? Actually board has no 8s, so they'd have pair of 8s with board pair 3s => they'd have two pair (8s and 3s). Not full house. To have full house they'd need a combination like 3 and 10? That would give them full house 3s over tens? Wait full house is three of a kind plus a pair. If board is 3c Td 3d, and opponent has 3 and T, they'd have three 3s (two on board + one in hand) and a pair of Tens (board Ten + hand Ten) => full house 3s over Ts. Yes.

Set of tens beats us (tens > eights). Also opponent could have 8 and something else gives them full house? 8 and 3 gives full house 8s over 3s (we have trips 8s, they'd have full house 8s over 3s, which beats us). Similarly 8 and T gives full house 8s over Ts, beats us. Also opponent could have pocket pair like 33 or TT gives them full house? Let's see: 33 + board 3c Td 3d gives them quads? Actually board has two 3s, they have two 3s, that is four of a kind (quads). That's even stronger. TT gives them full house Ts over 3s (since board has pair 3s). That beats us.\n\nThus many combos beat us. But opponent's action: flop check from Seat 3 (likely the only opponent left). So only Seat 3 is still in hand. Preflop: Seat 3 posted SB 2, then called? Actually preflop: seat 3 post_sb 2 (small blind). Then later seat 3 call 10 (so they called raise of 12? Wait preflop: seat5 raised to 12, seat2 called 12, seat3 call 10?

With set of 8s, but board is paired, many combos beat us. Opponent checked, could be weak or could be trap. Our stack is 171 chips, pot 40, we have 8s, we could consider raising to protect against draws? There are no straight/flush draws? Board: 3c Td 3d, no flush draw (two clubs, two diamonds). Straight draw? Need 4-5-6-7? Not possible. So only combos that beat us are made hands. Since opponent checked, they may have weak hand like a draw (none) or a middle pair, but could also be slow playing a strong hand. Raising could extract value from worse hands (e.g., a single 8, a 3, a T, etc.) but also risk being called by stronger full house combos.\n\nGiven stack size moderate, tournament stage unknown. Probably we want to bet for value. Minimum raise is 8, to 48 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Current pot 40, we have not contributed on flop. If we raise to 48, we add 48 chips. That would be a small raise, maybe we can raise to 60? Minimum raise to 8 means raise total to 8? Actually raise_to is total amount you're putting in, not additional. Since amount to call is 0, raise_to would be the bet size. Minimum raise is 8, so raise_to must be at least 8. So we could raise to 48? Wait typical: raise_to is total bet amount, not total stack. Since no bet, raise_to is the amount we bet. Minimum raise is 8 chips, so we must bet at least 8. So raise_to=8 is allowed (bet 8). That is 1/5 pot. Might be too small. Could raise to 20 (half pot) or 30. We need to decide.\n\nGiven opponent likely has a range of many combos, betting for value is good. I'd raise to 30 (total bet 30) to get value from weaker hands.

Actually after raise, pot is 150+30+80 =260. They raise to 110 total (30+80). Amount to call 50. Minimum raise to 130 (so raise total 130). Our stack 141, could raise all-in for 141 (total). But is that wise? Likely not. We could call 50, see turn. But calling may be losing if opponent has set. Turn card unknown. Pot odds: call 50 to win pot of 260+50? Actually current pot before call is 150+30+80 =260. If we call 50, we invest 50 for pot 260, equity needed ~16.3%. Our hand vs opponent's range: maybe opponent has set (33) ~ 3 outs to improve? Actually we have 8s, we could improve to set of eights (if 8 appears). There are two eights left in deck. Turn + river: 2 cards, chance to hit at least one 8 = 1 - (45/47)*(44/46) \u2248 1 - (0.9574)*(0.9565) = 1 - 0.915 \u2248 0.085 = 8.5% chance to make set, plus maybe two pair? If turn is a Ten, we get two pair (T8) but board has T, so we would have pair of tens? Actually we have 8s, board T,3,3. If turn is Ten, we have two pair tens and threes? Actually we would have pair of tens (board Ten plus turn Ten) and pair of threes, but we only have one ten, board already has ten, so we would have two tens? Wait we have no ten. If turn is Ten, board becomes T T 3 3, we have pair of tens (board) and pair of threes (board). That's two pair, but opponent may have better. So not great. So equity low. So calling is not profitable.\n\nThus best to fold. However we could consider raising all-in as a bluff? But our stack is 141, raising to 130 would be a big bluff. Opponent likely has strong hand; bluff may not work. Better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nReturn JSON.",

So pot is 80 chips (as given). Amount to call is 16 (to match 24). Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise total to 40). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: K5 offsuit in BB facing a 3x raise from UTG? Actually seat2 likely early position (maybe UTG). Stack is short (15 BB). K5 offsuit is weak. Opponent raise size moderate. Others called. So likely we should fold. But maybe we could call to see flop with decent implied odds? K5 offsuit is not great. At 15 BB, we want to preserve chips. Also we have 5h and Ks, not suited. Potential to make top pair K, but many players in hand. I think fold.\n\nWe could also consider opponent's raise tendencies: Kimi-K2 raise amounts historically 6,20,6,6,12,12. So they sometimes raise small (3bb) and sometimes larger (20). Here raise is 24 (3x BB). That's typical. Not a huge raise. But still, K5 is weak.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

They said preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4, Seat1 post_bb 8, then seat4 call 8. So seat4 (MiniMax) is in UTG? Actually after blinds, action goes to UTG (seat2) but they folded, seat3 folded, seat4 called. So we are SB after posting, we have option to call 4 (to match big blind 8? Actually amount to call is 4 because BB is 8, we already posted 4, so need to add 4 more to match 8).

Likely fold. Opponent MiniMax called BB, could be wide but unknown. 6c8c is not strong enough to play from SB vs BB raise? Actually it's just a call to BB, not raise. So we can call 4 to see flop. But with 14 BB, maybe we can limp? But we are out of position after flop, SB is first to act preflop? Actually after blinds, action is on UTG (seat2) then seat3 then seat4 then seat5 (SB). So SB is last to act preflop, so can call. However hand is weak. Should we fold to avoid playing out of position? Usually 6c8c is a marginal hand, could be played in SB if effective stack small? 14 BB is moderate. Might be better to fold and preserve chips.\n\nConsider tournament stage? Not given.

With a short stack (14.4 BB) we want to apply pressure and avoid playing out of position. Raising to 3 BB (24 chips) maximizes fold equity against the SB and BB, who have shown modest preflop aggression, and gives us a good chance to win the blinds outright.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have hand: BTN with As Ts (Ace high, suited? Actually As Ts: Ace of spades, Ten of spades, both spades, so suited Ace-Ten). Stack 115 chips, 14.4 BB (big blind 8). Preflop, SB posted 4, BB posted 8. So pot 12. Action: we are BTN, after SB and BB posted, it's our turn. Amount to call 8 (big blind). Minimum raise to 16 (so raise amount total 16). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: Seat 1 (SB) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 173. Their raise amounts preflop: 12, 36, 12, 16, 24. So they raise various amounts, sometimes 12 (3BB), 16 (2BB?), Actually big blind 8, so 12 is 1.5 BB, 16 is 2 BB, 24 is 3 BB, 36 is 4.5 BB. They seem to raise small to moderate, maybe open-raise? But they are in SB, they posted 4, they can raise. Their raise amounts show they are not just limp; they raise sometimes bigger. Not enough info.\n\nSeat 2 (BB) is Kimi-K2, stack 240. Their raises preflop: 6,6,12,12,24. So they raise 6 (0.75 BB) which is weird maybe a limp? Actually raise to 6 would be raise 6? Wait amount is maybe total? They posted 8 BB, so raise to 6 is less than posted? That seems odd. Might be they called? The data may be inconsistent. But they raise sometimes 12 (1.5 BB), 24 (3 BB). So BB sometimes raises.\n\nNow we have AsTs suited. In BTN, with short stack (14.4 BB) but still enough to raise. Typically we could open raise to 2.5-3 BB (20-24). Since we have decent hand, we could raise to 24 (3 BB) to isolate. Or we could call (just see flop) but with 14 BB maybe want to steal blinds. AsTs is a good hand for steal, suited Ace with decent equity.\n\nBut we need to consider opponent tendencies: SB may raise occasionally; if they raise, we would respond accordingly. But they haven't acted yet; it's our turn. They posted 4; they could raise after us? Actually order: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, then BTN acts. If we raise, SB and BB will act after us. If we call (just match BB), then SB and BB can act (SB could raise or check; BB could check). Usually in BTN you want to raise to steal.\n\nGiven stack sizes: SB 173 (15 BB?), BB 240 (30 BB). Our stack is shortest. So raising may isolate us vs BB or SB. If they both call, pot will be 12 + 8 + raise? Actually if we raise to 16 total (2 BB), then SB must call 12 more (since they posted 4), BB must call 8 more (since posted 8). That would be okay.\n\nBut we need to consider risk: AsTs suited is good but not premium. With short stack, if we get 3-bet, we may be in trouble. However, there is no raise yet; we are first to act.\n\nThus best action: raise to maybe 24 (3 BB) to apply pressure. But minimum raise is 16. We could raise to 24, which is 3 BB. Is that within our stack? Yes we have 115 chips, raising to 24 leaves 91 chips behind.\n\nConsider pot odds: If we call (8) pot becomes 20, we risk 8 to see flop. AsTs suited has about 30% equity vs random. Might be okay but we might be out of position post-flop (SB and BB act before us). Better to raise.\n\nThus I will raise to 24.\n\nNow we need to produce JSON.",

Actually seat 3 is after SB and BB, so likely UTG). We are in BB, facing 12 to call (20-8). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise additional 12 to total 32). Need to consider hand strength: Q7 suited is a marginal hand. In early position raise, likely a strong range (maybe 10%+). Q7s is weak, not a good call. Also stack is 16.4 BB, not huge but can call. However calling 12 into pot 32 gives pot odds ~ 12/(32+12) = 27% to win. Q7s vs unknown range maybe ~10% equity. Not good.\n\nWe could consider raising as a bluff? But with 16 BB stack, raising to 32 would be a 2x raise (from 20 to 32). Might be okay if we think opponent can fold.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #49 preflop. Position: BB (seat5). Our cards: 8d 9d, suited connectors, decent for a 15.9 BB stack. Blinds 4/8, we posted SB 4? Actually seat5 is BB, but actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4 (so they posted small blind? Wait seat5 is BB? They said Position: BB (Seat5). But actions: seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8. So seat5 is small blind, seat1 is big blind. So we are actually in SB, not BB. But they said Position: BB. Might be confusion: maybe seat5 is BB and seat1 is SB? Actually typical: SB posts half big blind, BB posts full. Here SB is 4, BB is 8. So seat5 posted SB 4, seat1 posted BB 8. So seat5 is SB, not BB. But they say Position: BB (Seat5). Might be mislabel. Regardless, we are first to act after the blind posting? After SB and BB posted, it's UTG etc but all others folded, so it's just us (SB) and BB. The action order: preflop: seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8, then seat2 fold, seat3 fold, seat4 fold. So now it's our turn (SB) to act facing a bet of 8 (BB). The amount to call is 4 (since we already have 4 in SB, need to call 4 more to match 8). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise total to 16). So legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nOur stack 127 chips, we have 15.9 BB (big blind is 8). So we have enough.\n\nWe have 8d9d, suited connectors. In SB vs BB heads-up, we can consider raising (3-bet) or just call. Need opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat1) is the BB. We have recall of opponent raises: they have raised preflop amounts varying. In previous hands, they raised 8 (which is just BB), 12, 36, 12, 16, 24. Not clear if they are aggressive. But they have been raising preflop (maybe 3-betting?) Actually those are their actions as the BB when they raise? In heads-up, they may raise as BB (i.e., they open-raise). But here they posted BB 8, not raise. So we are facing a standard BB bet (just posting). So opponent hasn't raised. So we can consider raising with suited connectors to take initiative, especially with stack ~16 BB. In heads-up, 8d9d is a decent hand to raise and try to steal the blind. However we are in SB with 8d9d, we have 4 in, need 4 to call. If we raise to 16 total, that's a raise of 8 more (since call would be 8 total). Actually raise total to 16 means we put 16 total into pot (including our 4 already?), raise amount = 12 more? Wait we have posted 4, need to call 4 to match 8, then raise to 16 total means we need to add 12 (since we already have 4). So raise amount = 12 chips. That's a 3-bet sized about 2x BB.\n\nGiven our stack, a raise to 16 is fine. Opponent's tendencies: they have raised preflop in earlier hands, sometimes big (36). Might be aggressive, could 3-bet call or re-raise. But they are also the BB, they might defend. In heads-up, they may defend a wide range. So raising could be good to take pot.\n\nAlternatively we could call and see flop. 8d9d is a drawing hand; but in heads-up, we want to be aggressive. If we call, we are in position (SB acts first preflop, then on flop we are out of position). Actually after flop, BB acts first. So being out of position is disadvantage. Raising gives us initiative and possibly win the pot preflop.\n\nGiven stack 15.9 BB, we could also consider all-in? Not needed.\n\nThus decision: raise to 16 (total). Reason: suited connectors, decent equity, want to steal, opponent likely defends but raise puts pressure.\n\nLet's answer.",

We need to consider opponent tendencies: recall shows Kimi-K2 Thinking (SB) has raised preflop in past 5 raises amounts: 12,36,12,16,24. Those are raises from SB? Actually they are SB seat1. So they raise sometimes large (36). Might be aggressive. Seat2 Kimi-K2 (BB) unknown. Since we have 17 BB, maybe we should raise to try to steal both blinds, but risk being 3-bet? The SB could re-raise. But with K9 off, not great.\n\nWe could also just call 8 and see flop. But with short stack, calling may commit us to see flop with marginal hand, risking more chips. If we call and flop misses, we may be forced to fold later. Better to either push all-in or fold.\n\nAll-in amount: 139 chips, but min raise is 16, we could raise to 16 (just 2 BB raise). That's not a steal; they'd likely call. Might as well go all-in if we decide to raise.\n\nGiven K9 off, I think folding is prudent. However with 17 BB, we could consider a steal attempt. But the SB is aggressive; they may 3-bet and we would be in trouble. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n"

Actually seat 3 is after BB? Seats: 1,2,3,4,5. SB is seat4, BB seat5. So seat3 is UTG? Actually positions: seat1 is UTG? Not sure but seat3 is likely early position. They raised to 24 (3x big blind). That's a standard raise.\n\nWe have 9-9, a medium pair. Stack 16.4 BB, deep enough. Should we call or raise? Considering opponent's raise size 24 (3BB). In BB we need to call 16 more (since we already have 8 posted). Pot after call would be 36+16=52. Our stack after call would be 115. We could consider 3-betting.\n\nWhat is opponent's tendency? Past raises amounts: 18,6,12,14,20. Mostly small raises (6 is 0.75BB). The 24 raise is larger. Could be a strong hand. But we have a pocket pair; 9s is decent but vulnerable to overpairs. 3-betting could isolate and maybe win preflop. However stack is relatively shallow (16 BB). 3-bet to minimum raise 40 (5BB total). That would be 40 total, i.e., raise to 40, meaning we add 32 more (since 8 already posted). That would be a 2.5x raise over original 24 (so about 5BB). That's a decent size, could be considered a 3-bet.\n\nGiven our stack, 9-9 is decent to call and see flop. But raising could take down pot or give us initiative. Opponent may be raising wide; we have a decent hand. 3-bet could be profitable if opponent folds enough. However if they call, we may be in a multi-way? Actually only two players left: us and DeepSeek. So 3-bet would go heads-up. If they 4-bet, they'd be strong. Our stack can handle 3-bet.\n\nWe need to consider tournament dynamics: 16 BB is not huge but not too short. Preserving chips is important but we also can risk.\n\nGiven we have a pair, calling is safe. But raising could gain extra value if they call with worse (like lower pairs, suited connectors). 9-9 vs typical UTG range: likely overpairs (TT+, AK, AQ). So 9-9 may be behind. So maybe better to just call and see flop, not risk bigger pot.\n\nThus I think call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. We'll call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Minimum raise to 16 means we need to bet at least 16 chips (i.e., raise to 16). So we can bet 16 or more. Our stack 115, we could go all-in.\n\nGiven we have a weak hand relative to board, we likely want to check (fold to bet). But we have a gutshot and pair, maybe we could consider a check-raise if we think opponent is bluffing. But opponent's raise preflop indicates strength. On flop they could continuation bet (c-bet) with many hands. The board is Q K T, they might have Qx, Kx, AK, AQ, etc. Our 9s is not strong. We may want to check and possibly fold to a bet. But we can also consider a small raise to try to take pot? Unlikely.\n\nThus best action: check. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call 0, we can check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Wait we started with 115 stack before posting BB? Actually \"Your Stack: 115 chips (14.4 BB)\" after posting BB? Usually stack includes blind posted.

Actually the stack listed is before any actions? Usually it's current stack before hand. After posting BB, you have 115-8 = 107 left to act. Then you called 16, leaving 91. Pot is 87 now (including our call). Opponent bet 35, we need to call 35 to see turn. Our remaining stack after call would be 91-35 = 56 chips, which is about 7 BB. So calling would leave us short.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: we have 115 chips, relatively short stack (14.4 BB). Opponent has 209 chips, larger.

Actually pot before bet is 87, opponent bet 35 making pot 122. To call 35, we need 35/ (122) = 28.7% required equity. Our equity maybe around 20% so not profitable. Could raise? Minimum raise to 70 (i.e., raise total to 70). That would be raise of 35 more (since bet 35). That would be a 70 total bet, meaning we put 70 chips in. Our stack left after raise would be 91-70 = 21 chips (still have some). That would be a semi-bluff maybe? But we have low equity, and raising could force fold from many hands, but also could get called by better hands, losing more chips.

          "reasoning_content": "We have BB, 6s Kd. Stack 111 chips, 13.9 BB, blinds 4/8, pot 12. Opponent seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 165 chips. He posted BB? Actually seat1 is BB? Wait: seat5 is BB (us). Seat1 posted SB 4, seat1 posted BB 8? Actually they listed seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8. So seat5 is SB? But they said position BB seat5. Might be reversed: seat5 is BB (we are BB). Seat1 is SB? Actually they posted SB 4 (seat5) then post_bb 8 (seat1). So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But they say our position BB seat5. Might be a mistake. Anyway we are in blind, facing a raise? No, only blinds posted, no raises. Amount to call is 4 (to complete BB). Minimum raise to 16. So we can call 4 to see flop. Hand 6s Kd is moderate. In early position (BB) vs only one opponent (SB) who posted 4 and hasn't acted yet? Actually preflop order: SB posts 4, BB posts 8, then action goes to UTG etc but all folded, so now it's our turn? Actually after blinds, action goes to player left of BB (SB) first. SB posted 4, hasn't acted. But they are already posted SB, they can check or raise. But the actions listed: seat5 post_sb 4, seat1 post_bb 8, others fold. So now it's SB's turn (seat5) to act? But seat5 is us, we posted SB 4. Wait they said we are BB seat5, but they posted SB 4 for seat5. Something off. Probably seat5 is SB and seat1 is BB. But they say our position BB seat5. I think it's a mistake; we are the big blind (seat5) with 8 posted. The amount to call is 4 (to call SB's 4). So we need to call 4 to see flop. So we are in BB facing a bet of 4 from SB? Actually SB posted 4, which is a blind, not a bet. So we can check (call 0) and see flop for free? In standard rules, after blinds, action starts with player left of BB (SB) who can raise or check (if no raise). Since SB already posted blind, they can raise now. But they haven't acted yet. So it's SB's turn to act, not BB. However the system says amount to call is 4, meaning we need to call 4 to match SB's blind. So it's BB's turn to act after SB? That implies SB has raised to 4? Actually SB posted 4, which is less than BB 8, but SB's blind is 4. The BB posted 8. So the amount to call for BB is 0 (since BB already posted 8). So the amount to call 4 is weird.\n\nGiven the format, they treat us as having to call 4 to match the SB's blind. So we are SB? Let's ignore confusion; we have to decide between fold, call 4, raise to 16. Hand 6s Kd is not great. In blind vs single opponent, calling 4 is cheap. Stack 111, 13.9 BB, we can call. Raise? Might be too aggressive. So call.\n\nThus output: action call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

No, board 4s 9c 6c, we have 6s Kd, so we have a pair of sixes (pair on board plus our six). That's just a pair, not two pair. No flush draw? Board has two clubs (4s, 9c, 6c) actually 4s is spade, 9c club, 6c club. So there are two clubs, we have 6s and Kd, no club, so we have a backdoor flush draw? Actually we have one spade and one diamond, no clubs. So we have 2 clubs on board, need two more clubs to make flush, not likely. Straight draw? Board 4-6-9, we have K,6. No open-ended. So hand is just a pair of sixes, not great.\n\nOpponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 165, they checked preflop (they are in BB? Wait seat1 is BB? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Wait blinds: SB is seat5 (post_sb 4), BB is seat1 (post_bb 8). So seat1 is BB, they checked after we called. So they have position? After flop, seat1 acted first? The actions show preflop: seat5 post_sb, seat1 post_bb, then seat5 call, seat1 check. So on flop, seat1 is first to act (since they are in BB, but after flop they act first).

Pot is 16 chips.\n\nWe need to decide: check or raise. Our hand is weak. Opponent's tendencies: recall shows they sometimes check, sometimes bet 14 on flop (hand 44). They also called a bet of 7 on flop (hand 39). They also folded a flop after checking (hand 40). So mixed.\n\nGiven we have a marginal hand, maybe we should check and see if they bet, then decide. But also could consider a small raise to take pot? However with only 13.4 BB, we might want to preserve chips. Check seems safe.\n\nBut consider opponent's stack 165, we have 107. Pot 16. If we check and they bet, we can call maybe with pair? But could be overvalued. If they bet big, we might be behind. So better to check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

Board has two spades: 4s and 6c? Wait 6c is clubs. So only one spade on board (4s). Our hand has 6s, so we have a flush draw? Need 5 spades, we have one spade, board one spade, need three more spades among remaining two cards? Not possible. So no flush draw. Straight draw? Board: 4,9,6,Q. Our hand: 6, K. Could we have open-ended straight draw? Not really. We have pair sixes. Opponent is seat 1, Kimi-K2 Thinking, with 236 chips. Preflop: they posted BB 8, we called 4 (SB). Then flop check-check. So on turn, we have amount to call 0, min raise 8, legal: fold, check, raise. Opponent's turn action not yet shown. We need to decide our action now (we are seat 5, BB). The board turn card unknown? Actually board listed includes turn? The board is 4s 9c 6c Qd. That's four cards: flop (3) + turn (1). So turn is Qd. So after turn, it's our action before opponent? Order: Since we are BB (seat5) and opponent is seat1 (UTG? Actually seat1 is SB? Wait seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Preflop: seat5 post_sb 4 (small blind). seat1 post_bb 8 (big blind). So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. After flop, action order: SB first (seat5) then BB (seat1). So on turn, same order: SB acts first. So we act now, opponent will act after us.\n\nWe have top pair K kicker. Opponent's stack is larger. What is opponent's likely range? They checked flop, so maybe weak or medium. Turn is Qd, giving them potential queen high, maybe they have Qx. Could be they have queen, maybe they have a straight draw? Not many combos.\n\nWe have 13.4 BB, short stack. Pot is 16 chips. If we check, we give them free card (river). If they bet, we can decide.\n\nRaising: min raise to 8 total (so raise of 8). That would be a bet of 8 into 16 pot, making pot 24. That is about 33% of pot. Could be a value raise to get called by worse hands like lower pair, maybe also a bluff to protect.\n\nOur hand is decent but not strong. With short stack, we might want to protect against possible draws (like QJ for straight? Board: 4-9-6-Q, no straight draws). Could be opponent has a queen, they'd likely bet. If we check, they could bet.\n\nGiven short stack, we might want to go all-in? But min raise is 8, we could raise to our stack 107. Is that allowed? Yes we can raise to any amount >= min raise. So we could go all-in as a shove. But is that advisable? With top pair, we might be ahead of many hands, but also behind some like Qx, 9x, 4x, or sets (6c? Actually 6c is on board, set would be 6x). Opponent could have 6x for set. Also could have Qx for two pair Q6? Actually board has Q and 6, we have 6, so we have two pair? Wait board: 4s 9c 6c Qd. We have 6s, so we have pair of sixes (one from board, one from hand). That's just a pair, not two pair. Opponent could have Qx giving them top pair Q with kicker. That beats us. So raising all-in may be risky.\n\nBetter to check and see opponent's action. Since amount to call is 0, checking is safe. If opponent bets, we can call if amount is reasonable relative to pot and stack.\n\nThus I will check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. No call because amount 0.\n\nThus choose check.\n\n"

Minimum raise to 8 (so raise total 8). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, checking is possible. Should we bet? Consider opponent's likely range: They checked both flop and turn. They are seat1, Kimi-K2, 165 chips. They are likely to have a decent hand? Could be Ace, queen, maybe a straight draw. Board has A Q 9 6 4. They could have A Q (two pair), K Q (top pair with queen kicker), etc. Our hand is weak. We have only pair of sixes. Likely losing. So best to check and fold if they bet later. So action: check. Reasoning: weak hand, opponent checked earlier, likely has better hand, no value to bet.",

A raise to 16 may win the blinds outright and, if called, leaves us with ample chips to continue post\u2011flop.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have BTN with Ac7c, stack 107 chips (13.4 BB). Blinds 4/8, small blind posted by seat1 (4), big blind seat2 (8). So we are facing a big blind (8) and a small blind (4). The amount to call is 8 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Hand: Ace of clubs, 7 of clubs. Suited Ace, decent for button. Stack shallowish (13.4 BB). Consider push/fold? At 13 BB, many push/fold ranges. But we have ability to raise to 16 (i.e., 8 more). That's a small raise (2 BB). Could also call and see flop. Let's consider opponents tendencies: Seat1 (SB) has raised amounts 36,12,16,24,16 in previous hands. So they can be aggressive, sometimes large raises. Seat2 (BB) has raised 6,6,12,12,24 (i.e., sometimes small raises). However in this hand they have posted BB, not yet acted.\n\nWe are BTN. Our hand Ace-7 suited is decent for stealing blinds. At 13 BB, a raise to 16 (2 BB) is a standard raise to 2.5-3 BB from button. That's fine. But we also have a decent chance to be called by BB (who may defend). However BB's stack 228, larger. Their raise tendencies show they raise small amounts sometimes. Could they call? Likely they will call with a wide range. So raising may get called. But our hand may have decent equity vs typical BB defending range. Also we could just call 8, see flop cheap, but we risk being out of position after flop (we are still in position, actually we are still BTN after flop, still last to act). If we call, pot becomes 20 (12+8). With 107 stack, we still have 99 left. Could play postflop.\n\nGiven stack shallow, many players push all-in around 10 BB. Could consider going all-in (raise to 107). But legal raise min is 16; we could raise all-in. However that may be too much with Ace-7 suited vs unknown ranges; but could be good to steal.\n\nWhat is tournament stage? Not given. But stack 13 BB is short, so we might want to preserve chips. A raise of 16 is not huge risk; if called we still have 91 left. That's okay.\n\nThus I think raise to 16 (i.e., 2 BB). Reason: attempt to steal, decent hand, position, and stack size.\n\nWe should check if any opponent has been folding a lot? We saw raises not folds. No data on folds. But SB seems aggressive raising. Could be 3-bet? Actually they are SB, they posted 4, not yet acted. They could 3-bet. If we raise to 16, they'd need to re-raise to at least 32. They have raised 36 in hand 27. So they could 3-bet. But that's okay.\n\nThus decision: raise to 16.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Could raise to 24 (3x BB) to apply pressure. Opponent BB has deep stack 272 chips ~34 BB. He may call or 3-bet. We could also go all-in for 107 chips (13 BB). That's a strong move but might be overkill; but tournament early stage maybe preserve chips. With QQ, a standard raise 2.5-3x BB is good. Let's raise to 24 (total). That is legal (>=16).

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with QQ, board A\u2663 4\u2660 5\u2666. Opponent MiniMax-M2 is in seat 4, called preflop raise, now on flop we have amount to call 0 (meaning we are first to act? Actually after preflop, we are in BB, we raised to 24, opponent called 16 more, pot 56. Flop dealt, action goes to opponent first (since they are in position? Actually seat order: SB (seat5), BB (seat1?), but here seat5 is BB, seat4 is MP? Wait seat numbers: Seat5 is me (BB). Seat4 is MiniMax-M2, who called preflop. On flop, action starts with seat4 (UTG? Actually seat4 is earlier seat than BB? In typical order, after flop, first to act is the player left of the button (SB) then BB etc. But here button is seat? Not given. But we see actions: \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning it's our turn and no bet yet. So opponent checked. So MiniMax-M2 checked.\n\nNow we have QQ on A-4-5 rainbow (no flush draws). Potential draws: Straight draw? Board has A-4-5, we have QQ, no straight draws. Opponent could have Ace, 4,5 combos, maybe a set (4s? board has 4s, 5d, Ac). They could have A4, A5, 44, 55, or combos like KQ? But we have QQ, so they can't have Q. They could have A K for top pair, etc. Our hand is overpair to board (QQ > A? Actually Ace is higher, but board Ace, so any Ace is top pair. Overpair to board is QQ, but Ace is higher rank, but we have no Ace. So we are behind any Ace. Also could be behind set of 4s or 5s, but those are unlikely. So we are likely ahead of many hands, but behind any Ace.\n\nWe have 87 chips, 10.9 BB. Pot is 56. We have 87 left after posting SB? Actually stack includes our remaining after posting SB? We posted 4 SB, then we raised to 24 (including 4? Actually we posted 4 then raise to 24 total? So we invested 24 now? Not needed.\n\nWe can check or raise. Consider opponent's tendencies: Past flop actions show mix of checks and bets. They bet small amounts (2,4,7,8) and also check. They called big bets (40) once. So they can be aggressive or passive.\n\nGiven we have a decent hand (overpair) but vulnerable to Ace, we might want to protect by betting. Pot is 56, we could bet around half pot (30) to charge Ace and draws. However we have short stack 87, pot 56, so a bet of 30 would be about 0.34 of stack, okay.\n\nBut we also could check to see if they bet, then we can call or raise. However checking may give them free cards; they might bet anyway.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: We have short stack ~11 BB, need to accumulate chips but also avoid being eliminated. Overpair is a decent hand to try to pick up chips. A check-raise could be effective if they bet, but we need to have raise to at least 16 (minimum raise). If they bet, we could raise.\n\nNow it's our turn, opponent checked. Options: check or raise. I think raise to around 30-35 (total) to apply pressure. Minimum raise is 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 16 means bet 16 chips. But we might want larger. We can raise to maybe 30 (total). Is that allowed? Minimum raise is 16, we can raise any amount above that up to our stack. So raise to 30.\n\nThus action: raise to 30.\n\nReasoning: Overpair, want to protect against Ace, extract value, opponent likely has weak hand, short stack.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

So they have some hand, maybe Aces, pocket pairs, draws. Turn card not given? Wait we are at turn stage, board includes 4 cards: 4s Ac 5d 2s. So turn card is the 2s (spade). So board: Ace of clubs, 4 of spades, 5 of diamonds, 2 of spades. So we have queen queens, no pair on board except Ace high. Our hand is still top pair? Actually we have no pair on board, we have overpair to board (Queens over Ace). So we are ahead of any hand except maybe Ace, or any set (but there is no set possible because board doesn't have pair). Straight draws: board has 2-4-5, possible straight with A? Actually 2-4-5, need 3 and 6 for straight. So opponent could have 3 and 6 combos, but they would need both to have straight, unlikely. Flush draws: there are two spades on board (4s,2s). So a flush draw would need two more spades. Opponent could have spade combos. They called preflop and flop, so they could have A? They could have A? They might have Ace (but board already has Ace of clubs). If they have Ace of spades, they'd have top pair Ace and a flush draw (two spades on board, plus Ace spade). That would be strong. Also could have two spades like K\u2660 Q\u2660? But we have Qs, but we have queen spade. Actually we hold Qs, so opponent cannot have Qs. They could have spade combos like J\u2660 T\u2660 for straight flush draw? Not possible. Could have any spade combos for flush draw.\n\nWe have 57 chips, 7.1 BB, short stack. Pot is 116 chips. We are short-stacked relative to blinds (8 BB). Actually 57 chips is about 7 BB, so we are low on chips. Need to pick up chips to survive. Our stack is less than 10 BB, we need to be aggressive maybe.\n\nOpponent stack: MiniMax-M2 has 126 chips (15.75 BB). So they have about double our stack.\n\nWe are in BB, we raised preflop to 24 (3BB). Opponent called. Flop bet 30 into pot 28? Wait pot after preflop: blinds 4+8=12, plus our raise 24, opponent call 16? Actually preflop: we posted SB 4 (but we are BB? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Wait seat5 is BB (our seat). Preflop actions: seat5 post_sb 4? That's weird: they posted SB 4, but they are BB seat5. Possibly they are playing with small blind on seat5? Might be a mislabel. Anyway, we raised to 24, opponent called 16, so pot after preflop = 4 (our sb) + 8 (bb) + 24 (our raise) + 16 (opp call) = 52? Actually we posted sb 4, then seat1 posted bb 8, then seat4 call 8 (call big blind?), then seat5 raise 24, seat1 fold, seat4 call 16. So pot = 4+8+8+24+16 = 60. Then flop bet 30, opponent call 30, pot = 60+30+30=120. The given pot is 116, maybe rounding.\n\nNow turn: amount to call? Not given. The actions list only includes preflop and flop.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Current board: 4s Ac 5d 2s. Our hand Qd Qs (pocket queens). Opponent (MiniMax-M2) in seat 4 has called preflop raise and called flop bet. So they have some hand, maybe Aces, pocket pairs, draws. Turn card not given? Wait we are at turn stage, board includes 4 cards: 4s Ac 5d 2s. So turn card is the 2s (spade). So board: Ace of clubs, 4 of spades, 5 of diamonds, 2 of spades. So we have queen queens, no pair on board except Ace high. Our hand is still top pair? Actually we have no pair on board, we have overpair to board (Queens over Ace). So we are ahead of any hand except maybe Ace, or any set (but there is no set possible because board doesn't have pair). Straight draws: board has 2-4-5, possible straight with A? Actually 2-4-5, need 3 and 6 for straight. So opponent could have 3 and 6 combos, but they would need both to have straight, unlikely. Flush draws: there are two spades on board (4s,2s). So a flush draw would need two more spades. Opponent could have spade combos. They called preflop and flop, so they could have A? They could have A? They might have Ace (but board already has Ace of clubs). If they have Ace of spades, they'd have top pair Ace and a flush draw (two spades on board, plus Ace spade). That would be strong. Also could have two spades like K\u2660 Q\u2660? But we have Qs, but we have queen spade. Actually we hold Qs, so opponent cannot have Qs. They could have spade combos like J\u2660 T\u2660 for straight flush draw? Not possible. Could have any spade combos for flush draw.\n\nWe have 57 chips, 7.1 BB, short stack. Pot is 116 chips. We are short-stacked relative to blinds (8 BB). Actually 57 chips is about 7 BB, so we are low on chips. Need to pick up chips to survive. Our stack is less than 10 BB, we need to be aggressive maybe.\n\nOpponent stack: MiniMax-M2 has 126 chips (15.75 BB). So they have about double our stack.\n\nWe are in BB, we raised preflop to 24 (3BB). Opponent called. Flop bet 30 into pot 28? Wait pot after preflop: blinds 4+8=12, plus our raise 24, opponent call 16? Actually preflop: we posted SB 4 (but we are BB? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Wait seat5 is BB (our seat). Preflop actions: seat5 post_sb 4? That's weird: they posted SB 4, but they are BB seat5. Possibly they are playing with small blind on seat5? Might be a mislabel. Anyway, we raised to 24, opponent called 16, so pot after preflop = 4 (our sb) + 8 (bb) + 24 (our raise) + 16 (opp call) = 52? Actually we posted sb 4, then seat1 posted bb 8, then seat4 call 8 (call big blind?), then seat5 raise 24, seat1 fold, seat4 call 16. So pot = 4+8+8+24+16 = 60. Then flop bet 30, opponent call 30, pot = 60+30+30=120. The given pot is 116, maybe rounding.\n\nNow turn: amount to call? Not given. The actions list only includes preflop and flop. Now it's turn, we have amount to call: 0? Actually after flop betting, it's opponent's turn? We are seat5 (BB) who bet on flop, opponent called. Now turn action is for us? Usually after flop betting, the next street begins with player after the button. Since we are seat5 (BB) and opponent seat4 is CO? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, seat5 is us. On flop, we bet first (since we are BB? Actually order: after flop, the first active player left of the button acts first. The button is seat1 (SB?), but seat1 folded preflop. So seat2? Not sure. However the action order might be seat4 first, then seat5. But flop actions show seat5 bet 30 then seat4 call 30, meaning seat5 acted first. So on turn, seat5 acts first again? Actually after",

If we check, opponent can bet, we may be forced to call or fold. If we bet/raise, we can put opponent to decision. Since we are short stacked, we could go all-in (57) to try to double up. Minimum raise to is 30, we can raise to 57 (all-in). Should we? Evaluate equity: If opponent has Ace (any Ace), they'd have top pair Ace, we would be behind. But they could also have flush draw (two spades). If they have Ace, they'd likely call all-in. Our equity vs Ace high is low (maybe 30% if they have A? Actually we have queens vs Ace high, we lose unless they have pocket pair lower than queens? Actually board Ace high, they have Ace, they have pair of Aces. We lose. So against Ace, we lose 100%. Against flush draw, we are ahead but they have outs. Against lower pair (e.g., 44, 55, 22), we are ahead. Against straight draws, we are ahead. So our expected value: If opponent's range includes many Aces, going all-in is risky. But we are short-stacked; we may need to push. Could also check and hope to see river for free card. But opponent may bet and we may be forced to call with limited stack. If we check, opponent may bet about 30-40. Then we have to decide to call with 57 stack. That could be okay if they bet small. But they might bet bigger. Better to take initiative.\n\nGiven we have 57 chips, pot 116, we are at about 0.5 pot effective stack. If we go all-in, we risk 57 chips to win 173 (pot + opponent call). That's decent. Considering opponent has double stack, they can call. I'd push all-in.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 57 (all-in). Provide reasoning.\n\n",

Need to decide.\n\nConsider hand strength: T-J offsuit (unsuited). In early position, generally not a good hand, especially short stack. With 10.8 BB, you could consider a push/fold strategy. At 10.8 BB, many players would push or fold. T-J offsuit is marginal for push; but maybe can call and see flop? But with 16 call, you'd be left with 157 chips after call, still decent. However, the action before you: seat 3 posted small blind 8, seat 4 posted big blind 16. No raises yet. So you can either call 16 or raise. Raising to 32 would be a 2x raise. With 10.8 BB, raising might isolate and maybe get called by later players (positions later). But you are UTG, many players left to act (positions 6-8). Raising may get re-raised. Probably better to fold or push all-in? But you have 10.8 BB; typical push range includes T-J? Some push/fold tables push with any Ace, broadway, maybe T-J suited, but offsuit is weaker. I think fold is safe.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: we could recall opponent actions. But limited time. Might recall that Kimi-K2 (seat 1) is aggressive? Not sure.\n\nGiven short stack, need to preserve chips. T-J offsuit is not strong enough to risk. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON.",

There's a raise from seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) to 169 (so they raised 169 from SB? Actually seat3 raise 169, meaning they raised to 169 total? The raise amount: they posted SB 8, BB 16, then raise 169 (so total bet 169). Amount to call 161 (169-8? Actually BB posted 16, so need to call 153? But given amount to call 161).

Need to decide.\n\nHand strength: K5 offsuit is weak. Against unknown opponent, likely not good. Stack is short, 10.8 BB, so we are short stacked. If we call, we will be left with ~12 chips, which is ~0.75 BB, essentially all-in. Could be a push/fold decision. With K5 offsuit, not a good candidate to push. Better to fold and preserve chips? But we have only 10.8 BB, maybe need to find spots to double up. However calling would be essentially all-in for 161 vs 169 raise (almost all-in). Is this a good spot? Likely not, because K5 is weak, especially against a raise from a short stack (maybe they are shoving). The raise is 169, which is almost the entire stack of that player? Actually we don't know their stack. Seat3 DeepSeek-V3.2 has 0 chips (out). Wait seat3 is out, but they raised 169? That seems contradictory: seat3 is out (0 chips) but they raised 169? Maybe data error; but seat3 is out, maybe they are eliminated but still listed. Actually seat3 has 0 chips, so cannot raise. Something off. Could be that seat3 is the raiser, but they have 0 chips, maybe they are the big blind? No.\n\nGiven the data, we might assume opponent is short stacked and shoving. With K5 we should fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually raise amount is 32 total, which is 2x big blind). So we face raise of 32, need to call 16 more (since we already posted 16). Minimum raise to 48 (i.e., raise additional 16). Hand: Th 7s. Not a strong hand. In BB short stack ~10 BB, facing a raise from a player who sometimes raises larger (we saw raises up to 177 chips, which is huge relative to stack). But currently raise is only 32, which is 2 BB. So likely a standard open raise from DeepSeek-V3.2. Our hand Th7s is weak, suited but low. In short stack, we could consider a shove if we think we have fold equity, but 10 BB is borderline for shove with marginal hand. Usually with 10 BB you can shove with a decent range, but Th7s is not great. Could call to see flop? But calling 16 chips adds to pot 56, so pot after call would be 72, effective stack after call is 141. Not great. Raising would be to 48 minimum, which is a 32 raise (total 48). That would be a 3-bet. With 10 BB, a 3-bet is a big move, but we could also go all-in (157). However, raising to 48 would still leave us with 109 behind, still short. Considering opponent's raise size is small, they may be opening wide. Our hand is weak, better to fold. Also we have 9.8 BB, can't afford to play many marginal hands.

          "content": "We have hand #69 preflop. Position BB. Our cards: 9c Ts (9\u2663 T\u2660). Stack 149 chips, 9.3 BB. Blinds 8/16. SB posted 8, BB posted 16. So we are in BB, we have already posted 16. The other players folded, only SB (seat1) posted 8 and we have to act. Amount to call is 8 (the SB's 8). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise total to 32). So legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide action with reasoning. Hand is 9T offsuit (9c Ts). In BB with short stack (9.3 BB). The SB is seat1, with 228 chips (about 14.25 BB). Opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking. We have some recall of opponent's raise amounts preflop: they have raised various amounts: 8, 12, 16, 24, 36. So they sometimes raise small (8 = min raise?), but they also raise larger. In this scenario, they just posted 8 (SB) and we have to call or raise. Since they posted 8, they likely just posted the SB, not raise. Actually SB posted 8 (small blind) and hasn't acted yet. So they are not raising, they are just the SB. So we have to decide to call 8 (i.e., just match the SB) or raise.\n\nOur hand 9T is a decent suited? It's offsuit. In short stack situation, 9T offsuit is a marginal hand. In BB vs SB, with 9 BB stack, you could consider a steal raise if you think SB will fold. However, SB is 228 chips (14 BB) and they posted 8. If we raise to 32, that would be 16 more (since we already have 16 posted). Actually raise to total 32 means we add 16 more chips (since we already have 16). So the total pot after raise would be: SB 8, BB 32 (including our 16 posted + 16 additional), plus maybe the call to 8? Wait: The raise to 32 would be total contribution from BB = 32, meaning we add 16 more beyond the 16 we posted. So the total pot would be 8 (SB) + 32 (BB) = 40 chips, plus maybe any other? That's a 2.5x raise relative to pot. That's decent.\n\nGiven our stack 149 chips, we can also go all-in (149) but that's a huge overbet relative to pot; not advisable.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: unknown but we have short stack; we may need to accumulate chips. 9T offsuit is not premium but could be used for steal. However, if SB is tight, they may fold. But we have no info about SB's tendencies except raise amounts preflop (they have raised sometimes). They might be aggressive. However, they are the SB; they haven't yet acted. They could raise, but they already posted 8. In many games, SB can raise to steal. So we need to anticipate if they will raise? Actually the action order: SB posts 8, BB posts 16, then SB acts first preflop. So SB can either check (i.e., just call the BB's 16? Actually they can call the BB's 16 by putting additional 8? Wait: In heads-up BB vs SB, after blinds, SB acts first. Options: they can raise, or they can check (i.e., just call the BB's 16). In many poker rules, after blinds posted, the SB can either raise or check (i.e., just call the BB's blind). So the amount to call for SB is 8 (to match BB's 16). So the SB can check (i.e., call) or raise.\n\nThus our decision is to either call the SB's 8 (i.e., just match the blind, effectively checking) or raise. If we call, the pot will be 8+16=24? Actually we already have 16 posted; we call 8 to match SB, making total pot 24 (8+16). That's the current pot. So calling would be \"checking\" essentially.\n\nGiven 9T offsuit, it's a decent hand to see flop in a short stack? With 9 BB, calling 8 to see flop is okay if we have good implied odds? But we have limited stack, if we miss flop we will be out. Might be better to raise and try to steal.\n\nBut we need to consider that if we raise to 32, SB may call or raise. If they call, pot will be 8+32 = 40. Our stack after raise: 149"

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #69 preflop. Position BB. Our cards: 9c Ts (9\u2663 T\u2660). Stack 149 chips, 9.3 BB. Blinds 8/16. SB posted 8, BB posted 16. So we are in BB, we have already posted 16. The other players folded, only SB (seat1) posted 8 and we have to act. Amount to call is 8 (the SB's 8). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise total to 32). So legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide action with reasoning. Hand is 9T offsuit (9c Ts). In BB with short stack (9.3 BB). The SB is seat1, with 228 chips (about 14.25 BB). Opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking. We have some recall of opponent's raise amounts preflop: they have raised various amounts: 8, 12, 16, 24, 36. So they sometimes raise small (8 = min raise?), but they also raise larger. In this scenario, they just posted 8 (SB) and we have to call or raise. Since they posted 8, they likely just posted the SB, not raise. Actually SB posted 8 (small blind) and hasn't acted yet. So they are not raising, they are just the SB. So we have to decide to call 8 (i.e., just match the SB) or raise.\n\nOur hand 9T is a decent suited? It's offsuit. In short stack situation, 9T offsuit is a marginal hand. In BB vs SB, with 9 BB stack, you could consider a steal raise if you think SB will fold. However, SB is 228 chips (14 BB) and they posted 8. If we raise to 32, that would be 16 more (since we already have 16 posted). Actually raise to total 32 means we add 16 more chips (since we already have 16). So the total pot after raise would be: SB 8, BB 32 (including our 16 posted + 16 additional), plus maybe the call to 8? Wait: The raise to 32 would be total contribution from BB = 32, meaning we add 16 more beyond the 16 we posted. So the total pot would be 8 (SB) + 32 (BB) = 40 chips, plus maybe any other? That's a 2.5x raise relative to pot. That's decent.\n\nGiven our stack 149 chips, we can also go all-in (149) but that's a huge overbet relative to pot; not advisable.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: unknown but we have short stack; we may need to accumulate chips. 9T offsuit is not premium but could be used for steal. However, if SB is tight, they may fold. But we have no info about SB's tendencies except raise amounts preflop (they have raised sometimes). They might be aggressive. However, they are the SB; they haven't yet acted. They could raise, but they already posted 8. In many games, SB can raise to steal. So we need to anticipate if they will raise? Actually the action order: SB posts 8, BB posts 16, then SB acts first preflop. So SB can either check (i.e., just call the BB's 16? Actually they can call the BB's 16 by putting additional 8? Wait: In heads-up BB vs SB, after blinds, SB acts first. Options: they can raise, or they can check (i.e., just call the BB's 16). In many poker rules, after blinds posted, the SB can either raise or check (i.e., just call the BB's blind). So the amount to call for SB is 8 (to match BB's 16). So the SB can check (i.e., call) or raise.\n\nThus our decision is to either call the SB's 8 (i.e., just match the blind, effectively checking) or raise. If we call, the pot will be 8+16=24? Actually we already have 16 posted; we call 8 to match SB, making total pot 24 (8+16). That's the current pot. So calling would be \"checking\" essentially.\n\nGiven 9T offsuit, it's a decent hand to see flop in a short stack? With 9 BB, calling 8 to see flop is okay if we have good implied odds? But we have limited stack, if we miss flop we will be out. Might be better to raise and try to steal.\n\nBut we need to consider that if we raise to 32, SB may call or raise. If they call, pot will be 8+32 = 40. Our stack after raise: 149",

However, if SB is aggressive and may call, we could be in trouble. But we have 9 BB, we can still call a raise if they raise? Actually we can only raise to 32 minimum. If they re-raise (4-bet), they'd need to raise at least to 64 (minimum raise to 64). That would be a large portion of our stack but still we could call or go all-in.

So we could call 16 and see flop, but stack shallow.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: We could recall opponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) call 16 from MP. Might be a loose call. Seat1 is unknown.\n\nGiven stack 173 chips, call 16 leaves 157 chips. If we call and flop is good, we could still be in position.\n\nBut QTh is not premium; it's a marginal hand. With 10 BB, many players would shove rather than call. However call 16 is only 1 BB. It's cheap. The risk: If we call and get out of position vs later raises, we might be forced to fold later.\n\nGiven we are in cutoff, we could consider raising to isolate. Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise by 16). Raising to 32 would be 2 BB raise. That is small but could isolate seat4 who just called. However seat4 may have a wide range, but raising could also get us 3-bet.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should shove all-in? But we have 173 chips, min raise is 32, all-in would be 173. That's a big raise. Is it advisable with QTh? Likely not.\n\nBetter to call 16 and see flop; if flop is good, we can commit. If not, we can fold.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nCheck legality: call is allowed.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Then seat1 folded, seat2 folded, seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised 64 (so after us calling, DeepSeek raises to 64 total? Actually raise amount 64 meaning they put total 64? The action log: seat3 raise 64. Since they are in seat3 (DeepSeek) after we called, they raise 64. So they are raising to 64 total (i.e., they add 48 more). Then seat4 (MiniMax) calls 48 (so matches to 64). Now amount to call is 48 (to match DeepSeek's raise). Minimum raise to 112. Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nOur hand: T\u2665 Q\u2666 (offsuit). In BB with 9.8 BB, short stack but not ultra short. Opponent DeepSeek raised 64 (4x big blind). That is a sizable raise. They are seat3 (position? Let's map seats: seat1 is after seat8? Not sure. We are seat5 BB. Seat2 SB, seat3 (DeepSeek) is UTG? Actually typical order: Seats 1-8 clockwise. SB is seat2, BB seat3? Wait they said \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So seat5 is BB. So seat2 is SB, seat3 is UTG? Let's compute: Seat numbers: 1 is UTG? Usually seat1 is first left of dealer? Not sure. But we know we are BB seat5, so seats 6-8 are later positions (CO, BTN). So seat3 (DeepSeek) is early position (maybe UTG+1). So they are raising from early position, likely strong.\n\nOur stack 157, after calling 16 we have 141 left. To call 48 we need 48 more, leaving 93. That's okay.\n\nHand TQ offsuit is decent but not premium. In early position raise, likely they have a range of strong hands (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK, AQ, maybe AJs, KQs). TQ offsuit is at bottom of value.\n\nGiven short stack and tournament, we may consider folding. However we have 9.8 BB, still enough to attempt steal? But we are out of position (BB vs early raise). Also we have 4 players in pot (SB folded, we called, MiniMax called). So pot will be 152 + 64 (raise) + 48 (call) = 264? Actually pot before raise was 152 (blinds + our call + MiniMax call). Then DeepSeek raised to 64 (adds 48 more). MiniMax called 48 (adds 48). So now pot is 152 + 48 (DeepSeek's extra) + 48 (MiniMax) = 248? Wait need to compute precisely: initial pot 152 includes blinds (8+16) + our call 16 + MiniMax call 16? Actually MiniMax called 16 before raise. So pot before DeepSeek raise: blinds 8+16=24, plus MiniMax call 16 = 40, plus our call 16 = 56, plus seat2 fold? seat1 fold. So pot 56? But they listed pot 152 chips. That's probably after all actions? Actually they listed pot 152 before actions? Might be current pot before DeepSeek raise? Hmm.\n\nGiven ambiguous, but we can compute effective stack: 157 total. To call 48 we need to invest 64 total (16 already). So call would be 48 more.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call, or raise. Raising would be to 112 minimum (i.e., raise total to 112). That would be 96 total invested (16+96?). Actually raise to 112 means we put total 112 chips into pot, which is 96 more beyond our 16 call. That is a big commitment: 112 is 7.0 BB, about 70% of stack (since stack 157). That's a big raise. Likely not advisable with TQ offsuit.\n\nThus best is to fold.\n\nBut maybe we could call and see flop with decent equity (~15%). However with short stack, maybe we can shove? All-in would be 157, but raise_to 112 is not all-in. We could raise all-in (since can't raise to more than our stack). But raising all-in with TQ offsuit vs early raise is too"

However legal actions only list fold, call. Usually if you are short, you can go all-in as a call for less than amount to call. But maybe the system only allows call if you have enough chips? Might be that you can call all-in for 141, which is less than required, but it's considered call (all-in). Usually allowed.\n\nGiven hand 2h9d is weak, especially out of position, short stack.

Also we have gutshot straight draw? Board 6-8, we have 7, so we have open-ended straight draw? Actually we have 6,7,8, we have 7, so we have 6-7-8, need 5 or 9 for straight. That's a gutshot (needs 5 or 9). So we have a gutshot and a backdoor flush draw. Not strong.\n\nOpponent (Seat 3) checked. So we can check or raise. With only 7.3 BB left, we are short-stacked. Our stack 117, pot 32. Minimum raise is 16 (to total 16? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in, so raise to 16 means put 16 chips total? Usually raise to 16 means you bet 16 total, but we already have 16 in pot as blind. Actually we are in BB, we posted 16. So to raise to 16 would be just checking? Wait legal actions: raise to at least min raise 16. That means we need to put total of 16 chips more? Usually raise amount is total bet size. Since we are in BB and no bet, the min raise is 2x BB = 32? But they say min raise to 16. Perhaps they treat raise_to as total amount you put in this round, not counting previous. Since we have already posted 16, raising to 16 would be just checking? This is confusing. In typical poker engine, raise_to is total amount you are betting including what you already have in pot. Since we have already 16 in pot, raising to 16 would be just checking (i.e., no additional chips). But they list min raise to 16, maybe meaning you need to raise to at least 32 (i.e., add 16). So raise_to = 32. However they ask to set raise_to to total amount you are putting in, not additional. So if we raise to 32, that means we add 16 more chips. That matches min raise to 16 (additional). So raise_to should be 32. Let's assume that.\n\nGiven our short stack, we might consider an all-in raise to try to steal or fold. Opponent checked, likely weak. Our hand is weak, but we could try to steal the pot with a bluff? However opponent may have Qx or something. Since they are short (they have 234 chips). They might call if they have Q or a pair. Raising to 32 (small) may be called by many hands, losing chips. Better to check and see turn. But we have only 7.3 BB, if we check and they bet later we may be forced all-in.\n\nGiven the situation, checking is safe. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions include raise, but we choose check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Non-heart 9s: there are 3 other 9s (9d,9c,9s). So total outs = 10 hearts + 3 other 9s = 13. Approx 13 outs. Chance to hit on river = 13/46 \u2248 28.3%. Pot 32, bet 16 would give pot 48 after raise?

The amount to call is 40 (they raised to 48, we have posted 16, so need 32? Wait: small blind 8, big blind 16. Seat 2 raised to 48, meaning they put 48 total. So amount to call = 48 - 16 = 32. But the problem says amount to call: 40. That suggests they posted 8 (SB) seat 5, seat 1 posted BB 16, seat 2 raise 48 (so maybe they raised to 48, meaning they added 48 on top of big blind? Usually raise to 48 means total bet is 48. Then amount to call = 48 - 16 = 32. But they say amount to call 40, maybe they consider we posted 8 as SB? Actually seat 5 is BB, so they posted 16 as BB. seat 1 posted SB 8. Wait seat order: seat 5 is BB, seat 1 is SB. So seat 5 posted SB 8? The actions show: Seat 5 post_sb 8, Seat 1 post_bb 16. So seat 5 is small blind, seat 1 is big blind. That's weird: position says BB seat5 but actions show seat5 posted sb. Possibly the seat numbers are shifted: they consider seat5 is BB but posted SB. Anyway, amount to call 40. So we need to call 40 to match raise. Minimum raise to 80 (so raise total to 80). Our stack 141, can raise.\n\nHand Jd8s is weak, off-suit, low connectivity. In early position (BB) vs a raise from seat2 (likely UTG? Actually seat2 is after big blind? Not sure). In tournament, short stack 8.8 BB. Should we fold? Likely yes. But consider that opponent raise size is 48 (3x big blind?), actually big blind is 16, raise to 48 is 3x BB. That's a standard raise. With 8.8 BB, calling 40 would leave us ~101 chips, still decent. But J8 offsuit is not a good hand to call. Could consider a shove? All-in would be 141, which is >3x raise. But J8 offsuit is not a good shoving hand at 8 BB; typical shoving range includes broadways, suited connectors, A-x, etc. J8 offsuit is borderline but maybe too weak.\n\nThus fold.\n\nWe could also recall opponent tendencies: they raise amounts varying, sometimes 48, sometimes 24, sometimes 12. No specific aggression. Likely a standard raise.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

Actually SB 8, BB 16, plus our seat? Wait we are BTN, we posted nothing yet. The pot includes SB 8, BB 16 = 24. So we need to call 16 to see flop.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call, raise. Our hand is weak but suited, could be a steal. With 8.8 BB, we could consider raising to try to steal blinds. However, we are out of position (BTN vs SB and BB). The SB is seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking (140 chips). The BB is seat2 Kimi-K2 (445 chips). Both have larger stacks. We have 8.8 BB, short. The SB is short too (140 chips ~ same). So both are short stacks.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall opponent actions shows Kimi-K2 (BB) raising amounts: 6,12,12,24,24,40,48,48,48,48. Those raise amounts likely relative to blind? Not clear. But they have raised 48 chips preflop (which is 3 BB) maybe? Actually blind is 8/16, so 48 is 3x BB? Wait BB is 16, so 48 is 3 BB. So they have been raising 3 BB sometimes. Also Kimi-K2 Thinking (SB) raised amounts: 8,8,12,36,12,16,24,16,24. Those are maybe amounts over SB? Not clear.\n\nWe need to know if they are aggressive. They have raised preflop many times, indicating they might be open-raising from early positions. But we are BTN, they are SB and BB. The SB may have posted 8 and could be defending. The BB is 16.\n\nGiven our short stack, typical play is either push all-in or fold, unless we have a decent hand. 6s5s is marginal for push. However, we could consider a steal raise to 48 (3 BB) to try to win blinds, but we have only 8.8 BB, raising to 48 would be 3 BB (48). Minimum raise is 32 (2 BB). Could raise to 48 to apply pressure. But is that advisable with 6-5 suited? Usually short stack steal range is broader, maybe any suited connectors, but 6-5 is low, risk of being called by better hands. The opponents have larger stacks; they may call with any pair, A-high, etc. But they may also be short and want to defend.\n\nGiven our stack is low, we could also consider going all-in (141 chips). That would be 141 total (including our call). That's about 8.8 BB. All-in might be okay with any hand as a shove, but with 6-5 suited it's borderline. But typical short stack push range from BTN includes any pair, any suited ace, broadway, maybe suited connectors down to 5-4 suited. 6-5 suited could be okay.\n\nBut we need to consider that the BB is 445 chips, so they can call. The SB is also 140 chips, similar to us, so they might call all-in with any pair or better.\n\nWe need to decide legal actions: fold, call, raise. Raising to 48 is allowed (minimum raise 32). Raising all-in (141) is also a raise (to total 141). Since raise_to is total amount we put in. All-in is allowed if we can't meet min raise? We can raise to any amount up to our stack.\n\nGiven short stack, a shove could be optimal. But is there any rule about tournament considerations? Preserving chips vs accumulation. With 8.8 BB, you are near the bubble? Not given. But typical optimal is to go all-in with any hand that has some equity. 6-5 suited has about 35% vs random hand, maybe 30% vs typical calling range. Might be okay.\n\nBut also could just call 16 and see flop cheap. However, with 6-5 suited, flop potential is decent, but we have limited implied odds due to short stack. If we call and miss, we are left with 125 chips, still short. Might be okay to see flop.\n\nGiven the pot odds: call 16 to win 24+16=40? Actually pot is 24, we call 16, total pot becomes 40. So we are paying 16 to win 40, pot odds 2.5:1, need ~28% equity. Our hand vs random is about"

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: we are BTN with 6s5s. Board: 5c 7d 3d. We have pair of 5s (top pair? Actually board has 5c, we have 5s, so a pair of fives. Also a gutshot straight draw? We have 6, board 5,7,3 => we need 4 for straight (4-5-6-7). Also we have a backdoor flush draw with spades (two spades in hand, board has no spades). So moderate hand. Stack 125 chips, blinds 8/16, we are short stack ~7.8 BB. Pot 40 chips. Opponent is Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) with 445 chips, big stack. He checked flop. He is the big blind, likely will act next. He checked, we have check option. Should we check or raise? Considering our stack is short, we may want to steal blinds? But it's flop, not preflop. If we bet, we can try to take down pot. Our hand is middle pair, could be best but also vulnerable to overpairs (8+, etc). Opponent has deep stack, may call with many draws. But we are short, we may want to pick up chips. The pot is 40, we have 125 left, we could raise to maybe 40-50? Minimum raise is 16 (to 32 total?). Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Minimum raise to is 16, meaning raise total to 32? Wait: \"Minimum raise to: 16\" maybe means raise amount? Usually raise to at least 2*big blind = 32? But they say raise_to is total amount you put in. If amount to call is 0, raise to 16 means we put 16 chips total, i.e., bet 16. So we can bet 16 minimum. With 125 stack, that's okay. Should we bet? Consider pot odds: opponent can call 16 for pot 56 (40+16). That's about 28% equity needed. Our hand maybe 30%? Might be okay. Also we have draws. Might be good to bet.\n\nBut opponent may have strong hand and raise. If we raise, we could get re-raised and be forced all-in. However we have short stack; we could go all-in 125, but that's huge relative to pot. Might be overkill.\n\nGiven short stack, we could try to steal the pot by betting 16 (small) and hope he folds. If he calls, we can evaluate turn. Probably best to bet.\n\nThus action: raise to 16? Actually raise_to total amount we put in = 16. That is a bet of 16. So \"raise\" with raise_to: 16.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We are in BB with 6h Jc, short stack 133 chips (4.2 BB). SB posted 16, BB 32, SB called 16, so pot is 64 (SB 16+BB32+call16). We are in BB, amount to call 0, can check or raise. Hand 6h Jc is weak, not a premium hand, especially short stack. In short stack, need to find spots to shove or fold. But we cannot raise less than min raise 64 (i.e., raise to 64 total? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in; min raise to is 64, meaning you need to put total 64 chips (i.e., raise by 32 more). That would be a raise of 32 additional, making total contribution 64. That is a raise to 64, which is 2 BB raise (since blind is 32). Our stack is 133, so we could raise to 64 (i.e., put 64 total). That would be a 2x raise, leaving us with 69 chips left. However, 6h Jc is not a good hand to raise. Could consider shoving all-in? Not allowed? We can raise only to min raise; we could also go all-in as a raise if we can't meet min raise? The rule says if you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in. But we can afford it. So likely we should fold or check. Checking will see flop cheap, but we are short stacked; if we check and get called, we will see flop with 6h Jc, not great. Better to fold and preserve chips for better spot? But we have only 133 chips, folding loses 32 BB (the blind) but we already posted BB. Actually we are in BB, already posted 32. If we fold now, we lose the BB (32) and are out of the hand. That leaves us with 101 chips left (since we already posted 32). Wait we posted 32, then we can fold (i.e., check). Actually folding after posting BB is just checking? In poker, you cannot fold after posting the blind if no one raised; you can either check (i.e., continue) or raise. If you \"fold\", you would discard your blind and not play? In tournament, you cannot fold the blind after the action returns to you; you can only check or raise. So \"fold\" would be illegal? The legal actions list includes fold, check, raise. So fold is allowed? In many implementations, you can fold after posting blind if there is a raise to you. But here amount to call is 0, so folding means you forfeit your blind? Usually you cannot fold after posting blind unless there is a raise. But the system includes fold as legal. So you could fold and lose your blind, but you keep remaining stack (101). That might be the best given weak hand.\n\nThus decision: fold (i.e., give up the hand). Reason: short stack, weak hand, not worth risking more chips.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have SB with pocket pair 2s, stack 117 chips (3.7 BB). Blinds 16/32. Already posted 16 SB, BB posted 32. Pot 128 (includes both blinds). Opponent (Seat 3) raised to 80, which is 48 over BB? Actually raise amount: they put 80 total, so they added 48 (since BB is 32). So amount to call is 64 (80-16). Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., raise by at least 48 more). Our stack is 117, after posting SB 16, we have 101 left? Actually total stack includes posted SB? Usually stack includes chips not yet posted; they posted SB 16, so remaining 101. To call 64 we need 64 chips more, leaving 37 chips. To raise to 128 total (i.e., add 48 more than call) would require 128 - 16 =112 total contribution? Wait raise_to is total amount you put in this round including previous contributions? In guidelines: \"raise_to is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\". So if we raise to 128, we need to have total contribution of 128 chips. We already posted 16, so need additional 112. Our remaining stack 101 can't cover 112, so cannot raise to 128; we could go all-in for 117 total, which is less than min raise, but maybe allowed as all-in? Rule: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So we could go all-in (117 total) which is raise to 117 (or maybe 117 total). But is that allowed? Usually you can go all-in for less than min raise, but it's considered a call? In tournament, you can go all-in for less than min raise; it's treated as a raise if it's at least call? Actually if you go all-in for less than min raise, it's a call if you cannot raise. However rule says you can go all-in if you can't afford min raise. So we could raise all-in.\n\nNow evaluate hand: 2-2 is low pocket pair. With 3.7 BB, short stack, we might consider shove (all-in) or fold. Opponent's raise size: 80 into 128 pot, that's about 2.5 BB raise (actually 80 total, so raise 48 over BB, 48/32=1.5 BB). Not huge. Opponent is DeepSeek-V3.2. Past behavior: raises varied amounts: 177, 32, 56, 64, 184. So they raise a range of sizes, sometimes small (32) sometimes large. Not sure about tightness. With short stack, we could shove with any pair? Typically with 3 BB, you can shove with any pocket pair, maybe also suited connectors. 2-2 is the weakest pair, but still a set possibility. Against a raise, shoving may be okay to try to steal blinds and maybe get called by worse or fold.\n\nConsider equity: If we call 64, we have 37 left, vulnerable to further raises? After call, we will be in the big blind with 37 chips, could be forced all-in later. Better to go all-in now to maximize chance.\n\nOpponent's stack 170 chips, about 5.3 BB. They could call or re-raise. If they re-raise, they'd risk more.\n\nGiven our short stack, typical play is to go all-in (shove) with any pocket pair. So we should raise (all-in) to 117 total (or maybe raise to 117). Legal actions include raise, we can raise to 117 (all-in). Provide reasoning.\n\nThus JSON: action \"raise\", raise_to 117, reasoning.\n\n",

The stack 5 chips is maybe after posting? The pot is 288, which seems huge relative to stack. Something inconsistent.

Board: 2s 2h Jh 5c (that's flop+turn? flop is 3 cards, turn is fourth, river fifth). So we are on turn after board 2s 2h Jh 5c. The actions list only up to flop, but we need to act now on turn. Need to know legal actions. Not provided. We must infer from situation: It's our turn (BB) after opponent actions on turn? Not listed. Possibly opponent checked on turn as well? The legal actions likely are check or bet/raise? But we need to query opponent actions? However we have limited info. We can use recall_opponent_actions to see opponent's behavior on turn in similar spots. But we need current legal actions. Could be check or bet (raise). Since we have 5 chips total, very short stack (0.2 BB). Our stack is 5 chips, blinds are 16/32, so we are deep short. Pot is 288 chips, we have a set of twos (pocket pair 2c2d, board has two twos already, so we have quads! Actually board has 2s 2h, we have 2c 2d => we have quads (four of a kind). That's the nuts, unbeatable. So we should try to get maximum value. Opponent (Seat 3) has 122 chips, likely has something like maybe a straight draw? Board: 2s 2h Jh 5c. Potential draws: maybe 9-10 for straight? Not likely. Opponent could have Jx for trips, but they'd have at least a set of Jacks. But we have quads, they could have Jacks, but they'd have three Jacks (Jx with board J). That's weaker. So we want to bet/raise to get value. However we have only 5 chips left; opponent's stack 122 chips. Minimum raise to 48 (from flop) but that's preflop? Actually minimum raise to 48 is from flop stage. But on turn, min bet is maybe 48? Not sure. Our stack 5 chips, we cannot meet min raise of 48, so we can go all-in for 5 chips. That's allowed (all-in). Legal actions likely include raise (all-in) or check. We should bet all-in to extract value. Opponent may call.\n\nThus action: raise to 5 (all-in). Reasoning: we have quads, unbeatable, need value, short stack.\n\nWe must ensure raise_to is total amount we put in. Our stack is 5 chips, but we already posted blind 16? Actually preflop we posted 16 as SB? Wait we are BB seat 5, posted SB 16? Actually blinds: 16/32, seat5 is BB, but actions show \"post_sb 16\" for seat5 preflop. So maybe seat5 is SB not BB? Confusing. But we have 5 chips remaining after posting? Actually stack 5 chips now includes our blind posted? Not sure. But we have 5 chips left total. So all-in 5.\n\nThus JSON.\n\n",

Opponent (Seat 3) bet 48 into pot 336? Wait pot after turn before bet: preflop pot? Let's compute: preflop: blinds 16+32=48, then raise 80 from seat3 (to 80?), Actually seat3 raise 80 (meaning raise to 80? Usually raise to 80 total? He posted blind? He is in SB? Wait seat5 is BB, seat1 is BB? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? The actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 16 (so seat5 is small blind). Seat1 post_bb 32 (big blind). Seat2 fold. Seat3 raise 80. Seat5 raise 128 (so seat5 re-raises to 128). Seat1 fold. Seat3 call 48 (calls to 128). So pot after preflop: blinds 48 + raise amounts. Let's compute: seat3 raised to 80 (so added 64 extra beyond 16? Actually seat3 had no blind, so contributed 80). Then seat5 raise to 128, adding 112 beyond 16. Seat3 call 48 (to match 128). So total contributions: seat5: 16+112=128, seat1: 32, seat3: 80+48=128, seat2:0. Total pot = 128+32+80? Wait we double counted? Let's just sum contributions: seat5 128, seat1 32, seat3 128 = 288. So pot 288 pre-flop. Then flop: both check, pot still 288. Turn: both check, then seat3 bets 48. So pot before bet: 288 + 0 (no flop bets) = 288. After bet, pot becomes 336 (as given). So we are facing a bet 48 into pot 336. We have quads, unbeatable. So we should call (or raise if allowed). But legal actions: fold, call. Minimum raise to 96, but raise not in legal actions (maybe because we are short stacked? Actually we have 5 chips left, which is less than min raise 96, but we could go all-in. However legal actions only list fold, call. So we cannot raise because we cannot meet min raise, but we could go all-in? Usually if you cannot meet min raise, you can go all-in but still considered a raise? In many rules, you can go all-in for less than min raise, but it's considered a raise. However the system says legal actions: fold, call. So we cannot raise. So we must either call or fold. Obviously we call to win. Also note we have only 5 chips left, but need to call 48? Wait our stack is 5 chips (0.2 BB). So we cannot call 48 because we only have 5 chips left. That seems contradictory. Actually amount to call is 48, but we only have 5 chips left, meaning we are short stacked and cannot cover bet. In that case we are forced to go all-in for 5 chips (call all-in). The system may treat that as call (since call all-in). So we call (all-in). So action: call. Reasoning: we have quads, unbeatable, want to get max value, call all-in.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

Preflop they raised from SB (post_sb 16) then called 16? Actually actions: Seat2 post_sb 16 (small blind), seat5 post_bb 32 (big blind). Seat2 call 16 (so they just called the blind, not raise). So they just called. So they have a wide range but maybe they have something like suited connectors, low pairs, etc. On flop, they are the only opponent. Pot 64. We are out of position (they are in SB, which is earlier). It's a small pot, we have weak hand. Options: check or raise (bluff). With 7 BB left, we could attempt a steal, but opponent may have many combos that connect. Our hand is king high, not a draw. Raising could be a bluff to take pot. But our stack is short, maybe we want to preserve chips. Check and see what they do. If they bet, we can decide to call maybe with a draw? But we have no draw. Better to fold if they bet. So checking is safe.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call 0. So we can check.\n\nThus answer: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

No flush draw (clubs: board has 7c, we have 2c, need two more clubs). So just K high, maybe backdoor flush draw (two clubs needed). Opponent seat 2 (Kimi-K2) bet 48 into pot 112.

To call 48, we would have pot odds: call 48 to win 160 (if we call, total pot becomes 208? Wait: pot before bet 112, opponent bets 48, we call 48, final pot 112+48+48=208). So odds 48/208 = 23% break-even. Our hand is weak; likely opponent has something. We have short stack 234 chips, 7.3 BB. Opponent stack 606 chips (maybe ~19 BB). So we are short. Should we fold? Probably fold, preserve chips. Could consider raising all-in (to 234) as a bluff? But we have only K high, not strong. Opponent's bet size is about 1.5 BB (48) into 112 pot (0.43 pot). That's a small bet, maybe a continuation bet with overcards, could be a weak hand. With 7 BB left, we could shove to try to steal? But risk: opponent may have any pair, they'd call.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #86 preflop. Position BTN, stack 218 chips (6.8 BB). Blinds 16/32, so effective stack is small (6.8 BB). Our hand: 7s Kc (suited? No, 7 spades, King clubs). It's a decent hand for BTN short stack? King-high with 7 kicker. With 6.8 BB, we could consider push/fold strategy. Minimum raise is 64 (so 2 BB raise). We could call 16 (to see flop) but stack is shallow. Typically with 6.8 BB, you either push all-in or fold, rarely call. But we can raise to 64 (which is 2BB). However, we could also go all-in (218). But legal actions: raise, call, fold. Minimum raise 64, we could raise to 64 (which is a standard raise). But with 6.8 BB, raising to 64 leaves us with ~150 behind. The opponent (Kimi-K2) is in BB with 686 chips. Their tendencies: from recall, they have raised 48 (2.5 BB) in hand 74 and 78, raised 200 in hand 84, called 16 in hand 85. So they sometimes raise big, sometimes call. They also bet on river etc. Not clear if they are aggressive or tight. With short stack, we may want to go all-in to maximize fold equity. The raise to 64 is small relative to opponent's stack; they may call with many hands. So better to shove all-in (218) if allowed? The legal action \"raise\" can be to any amount up to our stack? Typically yes. So we can raise to 218 (all-in). That would be best.\n\nCheck pot odds: we have to call 16 to see flop; but with 7K offsuit, not great. If we call, we risk 16 and can be out of chips if we lose flop. Better to push.\n\nThus decision: raise to 218 (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, want to maximize fold equity, Kc7s is decent for push, opponent's BB likely to fold many hands to an all-in.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have a tournament scenario, very short stack: 16 chips total, blinds 16/32, we are BTN with 0.5 BB (actually 16 chips is 1 big blind? Wait blinds 16/32, so small blind 16, big blind 32. Our stack is 16 chips, which is exactly the small blind amount. But we posted SB preflop? Actually actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 16, so we posted small blind of 16, leaving us with 0 chips? Wait stack is 16 chips, we posted SB 16, so we have 0 remaining? But later we raise 218, that seems impossible. Something inconsistent: maybe stack is 16 chips after posting SB? But they show stack 16 chips, then we post SB 16, then raise 218? That can't be. Perhaps the stack displayed is before posting SB? Actually typical representation: stack includes blind posted? Usually stack includes chips before posting, then posting reduces effective stack. But they show \"Your Stack: 16 chips (0.5 BB)\" but blinds are 16/32, so 0.5 BB is 16 chips, which is 0.5 big blind? Actually 1 BB = 32 chips, so 0.5 BB = 16 chips. So we have 0.5 BB total, which is the small blind amount. So we posted SB of 16, leaving us with 0 chips left to act. But the actions show we raise 218, which suggests we have more chips. Something off: maybe the stack is after posting SB? But then we couldn't raise. Possibly the stack shown is after posting, but they still allow raise because we have the ability to go all-in? However raise to 218 would be more than our stack (which is 0). So maybe the stack is before posting, and we have 16 chips, we post 16 SB, leaving 0, but then we raise 218 meaning we are effectively all-in for 218? Not possible.\n\nMaybe the numbers are scaled: blinds 16/32, but stack 16 chips is 0.5 BB, but they treat BB as 32 chips, so 0.5 BB = 16 chips. So we have 0.5 BB effective stack, which is less than BB, so we are short-stacked. Yet raise of 218 is huge relative to stack. Something off. Could be a mistake in the scenario; we should treat that we have enough chips to raise to 218? But legal actions only fold, check. So we cannot raise; only fold or check. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. So we should check.\n\nNow consider hand: we have 7s Kc, board 7h Tc 3s. We have a pair of sevens (top pair?) Actually board has 7h, we have 7s, so we have a pair of sevens, kicker K. Potential draws? Not many. Opponent (Seat2) checked. We have 0.5 BB left? Actually we have no chips? But we can check to see if we can win the pot. If we check, we go to turn.\n\nThus decision: check.\n\nWe must output JSON with action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Opponent (seat2) has been checking all streets. We have 16 chips left, which is 0.5 BB? Wait blinds 16/32, our stack is 16 chips (0.5 BB). Actually we are short stacked, only 16 chips left. The pot is 436 chips, huge relative to our stack. We cannot raise because minimum raise is 186, we cannot afford. So only legal actions: fold or check. Check means we go all-in? Actually check means we just check, but there is no bet to call. The pot is 436, we have 16 chips, we can check and then showdown, we will win if our hand is best. Let's evaluate hand strength: we have a pair of sevens. Opponent's range? They have been checking all streets, likely weak or drawing. Board: 7h Tc 3s 6d 6h. There is a possible full house for opponent: they could have 6-6 (but board already has pair of 6s). Actually board has pair of 6s. So opponent could have 6x for trips? Actually board already has two 6s, so any 6 gives trips (three of a kind). They could have 6-6 for quads? Not possible because only two 6s left in deck, they could have both 6s, making four of a kind. That's possible but unlikely. They could have a straight: board has T, 3, 6, 6, 7. Straight possibilities: 8-9? Not present. 9-8-7-6-5? Not present. 5-4-3-2-A? Not. So no straight. Flush possible? Board has hearts: 7h, 6h, plus? Actually 7h and 6h are hearts, plus? No other hearts on board. So two hearts on board, need three hearts in hand for flush, impossible. So opponent could have a higher pair: maybe a pair of tens (T) making trips? Actually board has a T, so a T would give trips. They could have T? Actually board has a single T, so a T in hand gives pair of tens (two tens) not trips. Wait board: Tc. So if opponent has T? They would have two tens (pair). Not as strong as our pair of sevens? Actually pair of tens is higher than pair of sevens. So opponent could have T? That would be better. Also could have a 6 for trips (makes three 6s). Could have a 7 for trips (makes three 7s). Could have a full house: e.g., 6-7 gives full house (6s over 7s) or 7-7 gives full house (7s over something). Actually board: 7h, Tc, 3s, 6d, 6h. If opponent has 7-6, they'd have 6s full of 7s? Actually they'd have three 6s (board has two 6s + one 6 in hand) and a pair of 7s (board has one 7 + one 7 in hand) => full house 6s full of 7s, which beats our pair of sevens. If they have 7-7, they'd have three 7s (board one 7 + two in hand) and a pair of 6s (board two 6s) => full house 7s full of 6s, also beats us. If they have 6-6, they'd have four of a kind 6s, beats us. If they have 6-? other, they'd have trips 6s. If they have 7-? other, they'd have trips 7s. So many combos beat us.\n\nOur hand is relatively weak: pair of sevens only, low kicker (K) but board has K? No K on board. So our kicker irrelevant. Opponent could also have a straight draw missed, but they checked all river, maybe they have nothing.\n\nGiven we are short stacked, we cannot raise. Checking leads to showdown. Should we fold? Folding would lose the pot. Since we cannot raise, checking is best. We should check and hope we win. So action: check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

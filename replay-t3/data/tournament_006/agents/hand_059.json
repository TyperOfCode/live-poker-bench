Seems tight. Just called here.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Mixed pattern - has made raises and calls. Made a 4x raise from SB position.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- I need to call 16 to win 40 (2.5:1 pot odds)\n- This is a 3-bet pot from SB vs BB\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 84o is in the bottom 15% of hands. Very weak, no connectivity, suited potential, or high card value.\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position post-flop which is a huge disadvantage\n3. **Opponent raise**: SB is raising into the BB, which typically indicates strength\n4. **Stack preservation**: I have a healthy stack and don't need to gamble with garbage\n5. **Implied odds**: Very low with this hand - even if I hit a pair, I'll likely be dominated\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, I'm out of position, facing a raise, and have no compelling reason to defend with such a poor holding. Even getting 2.5:1 pot odds, this hand has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range.\n\nLet me fold.",

This consistent tight play from UTG is good strategy.\n\n4. **Table Dynamics**: I can see opponents have been raising frequently preflop (especially GPT-OSS-120B in seat 5), so even if I limped, I'd likely face a raise.\n\n5. **Stack Size**: With 29.5 BB, I'm in the middle zone where preserving chips is important, but I have enough to be patient.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: No need to risk chips with such a weak holding when I have a playable stack.\n\nThis is a clear fold.

It can make straights, flushes, and two pairs, though it's not premium strength.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the button, which is excellent. Acting last gives me maximum information and postflop advantage.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: From my memory, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been quite active with frequent raises preflop recently, but also folds often when faced with resistance. With 87 chips (10.9 BB), they're getting short-stacked.\n\n**Stack Considerations**: At 21.5 BB, I'm in a comfortable position. The opponent is shorter and may be looking for spots to apply pressure with a wider range.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 16 chips to win a pot that will be approximately 64 chips, giving me about 4:1 pot odds.\n\nGiven my suited connector has decent equity potential, I'm in good position, and I'm getting excellent pot odds against what appears to be a potentially wide raising range from a short-stacked opponent, this is a clear call.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9d Js is a playable suited connector with decent equity potential. I'm getting 4:1 pot odds on the button against an opponent who has been raising frequently but also folding to resistance. With 21.5 BB vs their 10.9 BB, I have the stack advantage to potentially capitalize postflop.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Looking at the opponent's (Seat 5) preflop actions over the last several hands:\n\n- They've been quite active with raises: Hand #45 (raise 24), #46 (raise 127), #49 (raise 16), #55 (raise 16)\n- They also call occasionally: #53 (call 16), #54 (call 4)\n- They fold frequently: many recent hands showing folds\n\nThe opponent seems to be an aggressive player who raises frequently preflop, but also has a tendency to fold if faced with resistance. Their stack is 87 chips (10.9 BB), which is getting short.\n\nMy situation:\n- I have 9d Js (Jack-nine suited)\n- Position: Button (good position)\n- Stack: 172 chips (21.5 BB) \n- Facing a raise to 24 chips (from the small blind position)\n- Amount to call: 16 chips\n- Pot is currently 40 chips\n\nLet me think about this hand:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: 9d Js is a decent suited connector. It has potential for straights, flushes, and two pairs. It's not premium but has decent playability.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is excellent. I get to act last preflop and will have position postflop.\n\n3. **Opponent Analysis**: The opponent (Seat 5) has been raising frequently but also folding a lot when faced with resistance. With 87 chips, they're getting short-stacked and may be looking for spots to apply pressure.\n\n4. **Stack Considerations**: At 21.5 BB, I'm in a comfortable position. The opponent is shorter at 10.9 BB, which means they might be desperate.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 16 chips to win a pot that will be 64 chips (40 current + 24 raise + likely small blind call). That's about 4:1 pot odds.\n \nSuited connectors offer intriguing possibilities, especially with the potential for flush and straight draws. The button position provides a strategic advantage, allowing me to leverage positional information. While the hand isn't premium, it has enough potential to justify a call, especially given the favorable pot odds and the opponent's recent aggressive tendencies. The key is to remain flexible and ready to adapt based on the flop's composition.\n\nThe short-stacked opponent's raise range seems narrow, potentially indicating desperation or a strong hand. With limited chips, they might push with marginal holdings, creating an opportunity to exploit their range. My call could set up a potential float or trap, especially if the board develops favorably.\n\nThe calculation suggests a compelling mathematical edge. With decent pot odds and positional advantage, calling appears strategically sound. The potential to win against a tight range or capitalize on post-flop play makes this an attractive decision.\n\nThe hand's flexibility - suited connectors with straight and flush possibilities - adds further intrigue. While not premium, the combination offers multiple avenues for potential value, particularly against an opponent showing signs of short-stack pressure.\n\nPosition remains critical, with button advantage providing significant post-flop leverage. The 4:1 pot odds further strengthen the case for calling, creating a mathematically favorable scenario for continued play.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand and position**: I have 9d Js on the button with 156 chips (19.5 BB). This is a marginal hand with some potential but not very strong.\n\n2. **The board**: 4s Ac 5d - this is a relatively dry board with an Ace and some low cards. No obvious draws available.\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**: I just looked up GPT-OSS-120B's (Seat 5) recent flop actions. Looking at the data:\n   - Hand #37: They bet 30 on the flop and then folded - this suggests they might be betting with weaker hands and folding to pressure\n   - Hand #35: They called 8 on the flop - shows they'll call with decent hands\n   - Most recent hands (53, 54): They've been checking and folding, suggesting they might be in a tight/passive phase\n\n4. **Preflop action**: \n   - Seat 5 raised to 24 preflop (3x the big blind)\n   - I called from the button\n   - This suggests Seat 5 has a decent hand\n\n5. **Current situation**:\n   - Pot is 86 chips\n   - Seat 5 bet 30 on the flop\n   - I need to call 30 to continue\n   - Minimum raise would be to 60 total\n\n6. **Analysis**:\n   - My hand (9d Js) has very little showdown value against an Ace\n   - I have no draws (no straight possibilities, no flush draws)\n   - This looks like a pure bluff catch situation\n   - Given Seat 5's recent pattern of betting and folding (hand #37), they might be capable of bluffing\n   - However, with an Ace on board, they likely have some strength\n   \nI'm facing a critical decision point. The pot odds are compelling - 86 chips already in the pot, with just a 30-chip call required. This translates to nearly 3:1 pot odds, which is mathematically attractive. My chip stack remains healthy at 156 chips, so I can afford to take this risk. The board texture and my opponent's recent behavior suggest this might be an opportunity to extract value or at least see the next card without significant commitment.\n\nThe hand's progression - a preflop raise, flop continuation bet - indicates Seat 5 likely holds a solid Ace or a strong drawing hand. While my 9d Js lacks immediate power, the potential for improvement exists. The button position provides additional strategic flexibility, allowing me to control the hand's tempo and potentially gain more information.\n\nGiven the favorable pot odds and my stack's resilience, calling appears to be the most prudent approach. This conservative strategy preserves my tournament position while maintaining the possibility of significant gains if the hand develops favorably.",

Raising to about half the pot extracts value from weaker pairs and protects against free cards, and with a short stack we want to build chips. Opponent checked, indicating possible weakness, so a modest bet of 30 chips applies pressure without overcommitting.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with QQ, board A\u2663 4\u2660 5\u2666. Opponent MiniMax-M2 is in seat 4, called preflop raise, now on flop we have amount to call 0 (meaning we are first to act? Actually after preflop, we are in BB, we raised to 24, opponent called 16 more, pot 56. Flop dealt, action goes to opponent first (since they are in position? Actually seat order: SB (seat5), BB (seat1?), but here seat5 is BB, seat4 is MP? Wait seat numbers: Seat5 is me (BB). Seat4 is MiniMax-M2, who called preflop. On flop, action starts with seat4 (UTG? Actually seat4 is earlier seat than BB? In typical order, after flop, first to act is the player left of the button (SB) then BB etc. But here button is seat? Not given. But we see actions: \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning it's our turn and no bet yet. So opponent checked. So MiniMax-M2 checked.\n\nNow we have QQ on A-4-5 rainbow (no flush draws). Potential draws: Straight draw? Board has A-4-5, we have QQ, no straight draws. Opponent could have Ace, 4,5 combos, maybe a set (4s? board has 4s, 5d, Ac). They could have A4, A5, 44, 55, or combos like KQ? But we have QQ, so they can't have Q. They could have A K for top pair, etc. Our hand is overpair to board (QQ > A? Actually Ace is higher, but board Ace, so any Ace is top pair. Overpair to board is QQ, but Ace is higher rank, but we have no Ace. So we are behind any Ace. Also could be behind set of 4s or 5s, but those are unlikely. So we are likely ahead of many hands, but behind any Ace.\n\nWe have 87 chips, 10.9 BB. Pot is 56. We have 87 left after posting SB? Actually stack includes our remaining after posting SB? We posted 4 SB, then we raised to 24 (including 4? Actually we posted 4 then raise to 24 total? So we invested 24 now? Not needed.\n\nWe can check or raise. Consider opponent's tendencies: Past flop actions show mix of checks and bets. They bet small amounts (2,4,7,8) and also check. They called big bets (40) once. So they can be aggressive or passive.\n\nGiven we have a decent hand (overpair) but vulnerable to Ace, we might want to protect by betting. Pot is 56, we could bet around half pot (30) to charge Ace and draws. However we have short stack 87, pot 56, so a bet of 30 would be about 0.34 of stack, okay.\n\nBut we also could check to see if they bet, then we can call or raise. However checking may give them free cards; they might bet anyway.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: We have short stack ~11 BB, need to accumulate chips but also avoid being eliminated. Overpair is a decent hand to try to pick up chips. A check-raise could be effective if they bet, but we need to have raise to at least 16 (minimum raise). If they bet, we could raise.\n\nNow it's our turn, opponent checked. Options: check or raise. I think raise to around 30-35 (total) to apply pressure. Minimum raise is 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 16 means bet 16 chips. But we might want larger. We can raise to maybe 30 (total). Is that allowed? Minimum raise is 16, we can raise any amount above that up to our stack. So raise to 30.\n\nThus action: raise to 30.\n\nReasoning: Overpair, want to protect against Ace, extract value, opponent likely has weak hand, short stack.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Actually 2-4-5, need 3 and 6 for straight. So opponent could have 3 and 6 combos, but they would need both to have straight, unlikely. Flush draws: there are two spades on board (4s,2s).

They might have Ace (but board already has Ace of clubs). If they have Ace of spades, they'd have top pair Ace and a flush draw (two spades on board, plus Ace spade). That would be strong.

Minimum raise to is 30, we can raise to 57 (all-in). Should we? Evaluate equity: If opponent has Ace (any Ace), they'd have top pair Ace, we would be behind. But they could also have flush draw (two spades). If they have Ace, they'd likely call all-in. Our equity vs Ace high is low (maybe 30% if they have A? Actually we have queens vs Ace high, we lose unless they have pocket pair lower than queens? Actually board Ace high, they have Ace, they have pair of Aces. We lose. So against Ace, we lose 100%. Against flush draw, we are ahead but they have outs. Against lower pair (e.g., 44, 55, 22), we are ahead. Against straight draws, we are ahead. So our expected value: If opponent's range includes many Aces, going all-in is risky. But we are short-stacked; we may need to push. Could also check and hope to see river for free card. But opponent may bet and we may be forced to call with limited stack. If we check, opponent may bet about 30-40. Then we have to decide to call with 57 stack. That could be okay if they bet small. But they might bet bigger. Better to take initiative.\n\nGiven we have 57 chips, pot 116, we are at about 0.5 pot effective stack. If we go all-in, we risk 57 chips to win 173 (pot + opponent call). That's decent. Considering opponent has double stack, they can call. I'd push all-in.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 57 (all-in). Provide reasoning.\n\n",

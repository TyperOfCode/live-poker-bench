Even suited, it's:\n   - Very low card values\n   - Poor straight potential (9-2 gap)\n   - Flush potential is marginal at best\n   - Easily dominated by most hands\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG, which is the worst position. I'll be acting first on every street with many players behind me. This increases risk significantly.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 54 BB, which is a decent stack but not deep enough to play marginal hands from early position. I should be selective.\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should preserve my chips and wait for better spots. 9-2 suited is not worth risking even 4 chips.\n\n5. **Opponent Context**: I don't have specific reads on these opponents, but in general, playing 9-2 from UTG against unknown players is -EV.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. 9-2 suited is in the bottom 10% of starting hands. From UTG, I should be playing premium hands (AA-QQ, AK, maybe AQ, some suited connectors occasionally). 9-2 is far too weak.",

Seems tight/passive.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has shown some aggression - raised preflop in hands 36 and 37 (to 12 chips both times), and made a postflop bet in hand 35.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 182 chips (45.5 BB)\n   - MiniMax-M2: 207 chips\n   - GPT-OSS-120B: 137 chips (34.25 BB)\n\n5. **Current action**: Everyone folded to me on the button. I can call the BB (4 chips), fold, or raise.\n\nWith AK on the button, I should definitely be raising. A call would be too passive and miss value. The question is how much to raise.\n\nStandard raise size would be 3x BB = 12 chips total (raise to 12). But given:\n- The BB has shown some aggression (raised to 12 in previous hands)\n- I want to build a pot with my strong hand\n- I have position advantage\n- My stack is 45.5 BB, so I can afford a standard raise\n\nI should raise to around 12-16 chips. Let's go with 14 chips total (raising 10 more) which is 3.5x BB. This is a good sizing that builds the pot while not being too large.\n\nIf the BB has been raising to 12, raising to 14 might get more folds or define their hand better.",

With 2c 4d, I likely have less than 25% equity against a typical raising range.\n\n5. **Stack preservation**: With 207 chips (51.8 BB) and being early in the tournament (hand #38), I should preserve my healthy stack rather than make marginal calls with weak hands.\n\n6. **My history**: I've been folding weak hands from the SB position successfully, maintaining my chip stack.\n\nGiven the extremely weak nature of my hand, poor position, and unfavorable pot odds, this is a clear fold. I should wait for a better spot with a stronger hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2c 4d is an extremely weak hand with poor equity against a typical raising range. Favorable pot odds (1.67:1) still don't justify calling with such weak holdings, especially from the worst position (SB).

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 2c 4d - This is an extremely weak hand, basically the worst possible starting hand in poker. It has very little playability and is dominated by almost any other hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the Small Blind (SB), which is the worst position to be in when facing a raise, as I have to act first and the Big Blind will act after me.\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**: DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) has raised to 14 chips. Looking at their recent history, they've been quite active with raises and calls, suggesting they might be playing a wider range of hands.\n\n4. **Stack situation**: I have 207 chips (51.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. The opponent has 168 chips (42 BB), also a decent stack.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 20 chips, and I need to call 12 more to see the flop. This gives me pot odds of 20:12 or about 1.67:1, which means I need about 37.5% equity to make a profitable call.\n\n6. **My equity**: With 2c 4d, I'm likely dominated by most hands that would raise from this position. Even against a random hand, 2-4 offsuit has very poor equity. Against a typical raising range, this hand probably has less than 25% equity.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack and being relatively early in the tournament (hand #38), I should preserve my chips rather than make marginal calls with weak hands.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have one of the worst possible starting hands\n- I'm in the worst position (SB) facing a raise\n- The pot odds don't justify calling with such weak equity\n- I should preserve my healthy stack in this tournament situation\n- My history shows I've been folding weak hands from the SB position successfully\n \nI'll confidently fold this marginal hand, prioritizing chip preservation and avoiding unnecessary risk in an unfavorable position.\n",

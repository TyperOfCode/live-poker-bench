The risk of someone behind me having a better hand or raising is too high, and my stack isn't deep enough to justify set mining from early position.\n\n**Decision: FOLD**",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand:**\n- My position: BTN (button)\n- My cards: Ac Jh\n- My stack: 244 chips (30.5 BB)\n- Board: Qh Kc Td\n- Pot: 52 chips\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B with 115 chips (checking to me)\n- Amount to call: 0\n- Minimum raise: 16\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have Ac Jh on a Qh Kc Td board. This is a strong drawing hand:\n   - Open-ended straight draw (any 9 or any A gives me a straight)\n   - Actually, let me check: Board is Q-K-T. I have A-J. I need a 9 for a straight (A-K-Q-J-9). Wait, that's not correct. Let me think: \n     - Board: Q, K, T\n     - My hand: A, J\n     - Straight possibilities: \n       - With a 9: 9-T-J-Q-K (yes, that's a straight)\n       - With an A: A-K-Q-J-T (yes, that's Broadway)\n     So I have an open-ended straight draw (9 or A gives me a straight)\n   - Also have a backdoor flush draw with the Ac (two hearts on board: Qh and Td - wait Td is diamonds, so only Qh is hearts. Actually I have Ac, not Ah. So no flush draw)\n   - Overcard with Ace\n   - Decent equity against many hands\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is excellent. I can see opponent's action first on later streets.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has been quite tight/foldy preflop (many folds). They have raised occasionally (hands 37, 40, 45, 46, 49). They called my preflop raise here. They checked the flop. They have 115 chips left (14.4 BB), which is relatively short.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: If I bet, I'm building the pot with good equity. The pot is 52 chips. A standard continuation bet might be around 25-35 chips (half to 2/3 pot).\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 30.5 BB, opponent has 14.4 BB. I have a decent stack advantage. I should apply pressure but also be aware that my hand has good equity to continue even if raised.\n\n6. **Strategic options**:\n   - **Check**: Allows a free card, but gives up initiative. Could be okay if I want to see a turn card cheaply, but I have position.\n   - **Bet**: Standard continuation bet. I raised preflop, so betting here represents strength. With my draw, I can bet for value and protection.\n\nGiven that I have an open-ended straight draw with an overcard, position, and the opponent is relatively short, I think a bet is appropriate. I'll make a standard continuation bet of around 2/3 pot.\n\nLet me calculate: Pot is 52. 2/3 pot is about 35 chips. Minimum raise is 16, so I can bet anywhere from 16 to my entire stack. A bet of 35 seems reasonable.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 35,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Standard continuation bet with open-ended straight draw (9 or A gives straight) and position.

Actually seat 3 is after BB? Seats: 1,2,3,4,5. SB is seat4, BB seat5. So seat3 is UTG? Actually positions: seat1 is UTG? Not sure but seat3 is likely early position. They raised to 24 (3x big blind). That's a standard raise.\n\nWe have 9-9, a medium pair. Stack 16.4 BB, deep enough. Should we call or raise? Considering opponent's raise size 24 (3BB). In BB we need to call 16 more (since we already have 8 posted). Pot after call would be 36+16=52. Our stack after call would be 115. We could consider 3-betting.\n\nWhat is opponent's tendency? Past raises amounts: 18,6,12,14,20. Mostly small raises (6 is 0.75BB). The 24 raise is larger. Could be a strong hand. But we have a pocket pair; 9s is decent but vulnerable to overpairs. 3-betting could isolate and maybe win preflop. However stack is relatively shallow (16 BB). 3-bet to minimum raise 40 (5BB total). That would be 40 total, i.e., raise to 40, meaning we add 32 more (since 8 already posted). That would be a 2.5x raise over original 24 (so about 5BB). That's a decent size, could be considered a 3-bet.\n\nGiven our stack, 9-9 is decent to call and see flop. But raising could take down pot or give us initiative. Opponent may be raising wide; we have a decent hand. 3-bet could be profitable if opponent folds enough. However if they call, we may be in a multi-way? Actually only two players left: us and DeepSeek. So 3-bet would go heads-up. If they 4-bet, they'd be strong. Our stack can handle 3-bet.\n\nWe need to consider tournament dynamics: 16 BB is not huge but not too short. Preserving chips is important but we also can risk.\n\nGiven we have a pair, calling is safe. But raising could gain extra value if they call with worse (like lower pairs, suited connectors). 9-9 vs typical UTG range: likely overpairs (TT+, AK, AQ). So 9-9 may be behind. So maybe better to just call and see flop, not risk bigger pot.\n\nThus I think call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. We'll call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

So we have middle pair (9s) no straight draws (board shows Q K T, we have 9, so we have open-ended straight draw? Actually we have 9, board: Q K T, we need J to make straight (J9?). Wait straight combos: 9-10-J-Q-K is a straight, we have 9, board has T, Q, K, missing J and maybe also? Actually need J and maybe also? The board has Q K T. To have a straight, we need J and maybe also? The sequence: 9-10-J-Q-K. We have 9 and board has 10 and Q K, missing J. So we have a gutshot? Let's see: we have 9, board T, Q, K. The straight would be 9-10-J-Q-K, we need J. That's a gutshot (one card). Also we have a pair of 9s, which is low relative to board high cards. Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised preflop to 24 (3bb) from UTG? Actually seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2, they raised to 24 (3bb). We called with 9s. So they likely have a range of strong hands: broadways, AK, AQ, KQ, maybe suited connectors, etc. On flop Q K T, board is very coordinated, likely they have strong hand or draws. Our 9 pair is low. We have some equity if opponent has a straight draw (Jx) or maybe a set (unlikely), but they could have QJ, KJ, JT, etc. Also they could have A Q? Actually A Q would have top pair Q with Ace kicker, but board Q K T, they have Q? Not sure.\n\nWe need to know opponent's tendencies: recall opponent actions on flop: they have bet 20 (hand 2), bet 2 (hand 18), bet 40 (hand 43). So they sometimes bet small (2) maybe as probe, sometimes large. No pattern.\n\nOur stack is 115 chips, pot 52, we are BB with 14.4 BB. Minimum raise is 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total? Actually raise to total amount: minimum raise to 16 (meaning total bet 16? Actually we are facing amount to call 0, so we can bet/raise. Minimum raise to 16 means we need to bet at least 16 chips (i.e., raise to 16). So we can bet 16 or more. Our stack 115, we could go all-in.\n\nGiven we have a weak hand relative to board, we likely want to check (fold to bet). But we have a gutshot and pair, maybe we could consider a check-raise if we think opponent is bluffing. But opponent's raise preflop indicates strength. On flop they could continuation bet (c-bet) with many hands. The board is Q K T, they might have Qx, Kx, AK, AQ, etc. Our 9s is not strong. We may want to check and possibly fold to a bet. But we can also consider a small raise to try to take pot? Unlikely.\n\nThus best action: check. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call 0, we can check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Actually board: Q K T, we have 9, so we have open-ended straight draw? Let's see: board Q K T, we have 9, so we have 9-10-J-Q-K? Actually we need J to complete straight: 9-10-J-Q-K = straight, we need J. Also we have 8 to make 8-9-10-J-Q? Not on board. So only gutshot: need J for straight. Also we have a pair of 9s, currently not a made hand (no pair on board). So we have overpair to board? Board has Q K T, so 9 is lower than all. So we have just a gutshot draw and a pair of 9s (pair not on board). So relatively weak.\n\nOpponent (Seat 3 DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 35 into pot 87. That's about 40% of pot. They could have many hands: maybe Qx, Kx, T, straight draws, combos, etc. We have 14.4 BB left, stack 115. Our stack after posting BB 8, we called 16 preflop, so we have 115-8-16? Wait we started with 115 stack before posting BB? Actually \"Your Stack: 115 chips (14.4 BB)\" after posting BB? Usually stack includes blind posted. So we have 115 total chips, with 8 already posted. So remaining effective stack is 115 - 8 = 107? But we also called 16 preflop, so after call we have 115 - 8 - 16 = 91 chips left. Actually the stack listed is before any actions? Usually it's current stack before hand. After posting BB, you have 115-8 = 107 left to act. Then you called 16, leaving 91. Pot is 87 now (including our call). Opponent bet 35, we need to call 35 to see turn. Our remaining stack after call would be 91-35 = 56 chips, which is about 7 BB. So calling would leave us short.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: we have 115 chips, relatively short stack (14.4 BB). Opponent has 209 chips, larger. So we might want to preserve chips unless we have good equity.\n\nOur hand equity vs unknown range: With gutshot and pair, maybe ~20% equity. Pot odds: call 35 to win 87+35 = 122? Actually pot before bet is 87, opponent bet 35 making pot 122. To call 35, we need 35/ (122) = 28.7% required equity. Our equity maybe around 20% so not profitable. Could raise? Minimum raise to 70 (i.e., raise total to 70). That would be raise of 35 more (since bet 35). That would be a 70 total bet, meaning we put 70 chips in. Our stack left after raise would be 91-70 = 21 chips (still have some). That would be a semi-bluff maybe? But we have low equity, and raising could force fold from many hands, but also could get called by better hands, losing more chips. Since we have a short stack, perhaps folding is okay.\n\nBut consider possibility of fold equity: raising could make opponent fold many hands like Qx, Kx, etc. If they fold, we win 87 pot. We invest 70 chips, net profit 87, but we lose 70 chips from stack, leaving 21 chips left. That would be a big reduction, but could be okay if we think they are likely to call with strong hands. Opponent's bet size 35 (about 40% pot) suggests they may have a medium strength hand or draw. Could be a continuation bet with overcards, or a made hand like QJ, KJ, etc. Raising may be seen as a shove? But it's not all-in.\n\nGiven we have only 91 chips left, raising to 70 leaves us with 21 chips. That's like 2.6 BB. Might be okay if we can get them to fold.\n\nBut we need to consider legal actions: raise to 70 is allowed. Minimum raise is 70 (i.e., total bet 70). So we could raise to 70, which is a raise of 35 (so total bet 70). That would be about 70/87 = 80% of pot, a big raise.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, folding is safe. But we are short stack, we could also consider going all-in (call 35 is not all-in). Could we go all-in? We have "

Actually board: Q K T, we have 9, so we have open-ended straight draw? Let's see: board Q K T, we have 9, so we have 9-10-J-Q-K? Actually we need J to complete straight: 9-10-J-Q-K = straight, we need J. Also we have 8 to make 8-9-10-J-Q? Not on board. So only gutshot: need J for straight. Also we have a pair of 9s, currently not a made hand (no pair on board). So we have overpair to board? Board has Q K T, so 9 is lower than all. So we have just a gutshot draw and a pair of 9s (pair not on board). So relatively weak.\n\nOpponent (Seat 3 DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 35 into pot 87. That's about 40% of pot. They could have many hands: maybe Qx, Kx, T, straight draws, combos, etc. We have 14.4 BB left, stack 115. Our stack after posting BB 8, we called 16 preflop, so we have 115-8-16? Wait we started with 115 stack before posting BB? Actually \"Your Stack: 115 chips (14.4 BB)\" after posting BB? Usually stack includes blind posted. So we have 115 total chips, with 8 already posted. So remaining effective stack is 115 - 8 = 107? But we also called 16 preflop, so after call we have 115 - 8 - 16 = 91 chips left. Actually the stack listed is before any actions? Usually it's current stack before hand. After posting BB, you have 115-8 = 107 left to act. Then you called 16, leaving 91. Pot is 87 now (including our call). Opponent bet 35, we need to call 35 to see turn. Our remaining stack after call would be 91-35 = 56 chips, which is about 7 BB.

            "reasoning_content": "  I have 2d 9c in the SB. This is a very weak hand - it's offsuit, disconnected, and low. The only player left to act is GPT-OSS-120B who has called from the cutoff position.\n\nLet me analyze what I know about GPT-OSS-120B:\n- They just called 4 chips (2 BB) from the cutoff\n- Looking at their recent history, they've been fairly active:\n  - Hand 25: Raised to 12 (3 BB)\n  - Hand 27: Raised to 12, then called a raise to 24, but folded on the flop\n  - Hand 28: Checked from BB, then folded on flop\n  - Hand 29: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 24: Folded preflop\n\nSo they seem to be playing a somewhat loose/aggressive style with selective aggression. Their call from the cutoff suggests they have a decent but not premium hand.\n\nPosition: I'm in the SB, which is the worst position post-flop. I'll be acting first on every street.\n\nStack: I have 256 chips (64 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win a pot of 10 chips (5:1 odds). While the pot odds are decent, my hand is extremely weak and I'll be out of position.\n\nConclusion: With 2-9 offsuit from the SB against a caller who has position on me, this is a clear fold. Even though it's only 2 chips to call (0.5 BB), playing this hand out of position with such a weak holding will cost me more chips post-flop than I'll win. The implied odds are terrible with this hand.\n\nI should fold.",

There are 4 players left to act behind me. This hand has almost no playability postflop. Even if I call 4 chips, I'll likely face raises from later positions. The hand has poor equity against any reasonable range.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack (51.5 BB) and should preserve it for better spots. There's no reason to play this trash hand from UTG.\n\nThe pot is only 6 chips (blinds). The amount to call is 4 chips (1 BB). While it's not much, calling with 73o from UTG is just burning chips.\n\nLet me fold and wait for a better spot."

Opponents have decent stacks, but SB only 256 (15 BB). BB 154 (38 BB). They might defend. Kh5 is not a strong raise hand. Might just call and see flop. But we could also raise as a steal attempt. However Kh5 is not premium, but in BTN you can raise with a wide range. Yet you have to consider that SB is shortish? 256 chips is still decent. But they posted 2, so they might call or raise.

We have K high, pair of Kings, plus a gutshot? Not really. We have K kicker: King pair, kicker 5. Opponent (Seat2) is BB, checked flop. He is 154 chips, we have 163 chips. Both have similar stacks. He checked, we can check or bet/raise. What is his likely range? He is BB, preflop he just called 4 (big blind) and checked flop. He could have a variety: maybe mid pairs, draws, etc. Board is spade heavy; he may have spade draws. Our hand is decent but vulnerable to overpairs (AQ, AK, etc) but we have K of hearts, not spades. Could be top pair but not strong. We could check to see a turn, but also could bet to protect against draws and get value from worse hands (like weaker K, Q, J, etc). Pot is 10, we have 163 chips, min raise 4. Betting 4 (size of BB) is small, but could be okay.\n\nGiven tournament, medium stack, need to preserve chips but also pick up chips. Opponent's tendencies: from recall, he has raised preflop with 6 chips (hand 16,17) and 12 chips (hand22). He also bet on flop 6 chips (hand20). So he can be aggressive. He also called a 2 chip preflop (hand20). He seems to be willing to bet 6 on flop. So if we bet, he might raise? Hard.\n\nWe have top pair but no kicker advantage vs many. Might consider checking and seeing turn. If turn is a spade, we could be in trouble. If turn is a non-spade, we still have top pair.\n\nThus checking is safe. But we could also bet around 4-6 to protect. Since min raise is 4, raising to 8 would be a raise of 8 total? Actually raise_to total. So we could raise to 8 (i.e., bet 8). That would be 2x pot? Pot 10, bet 8 is less than pot. Might be okay.\n\nGiven opponent checked, maybe they have weak hand and will call a bet. We could extract value. But also risk being raised if he has a stronger hand like AK (but we have K hearts, not spade). He could have K spade? Actually board K spade, we have K hearts, opponent could have K spade (but board already has K spade). So opponent could have K with a spade kicker? Actually board K spade, so any K in hand is second King, but we have one King, board has one King. So opponent could have K? He could have Kx, giving him two pair? No, board K, you have Kh, opponent could have K? That would be K K K? Actually board has one King, we have one King, opponent could have another King, making trips. That's possible. So we have top pair, but opponent could have trips. So betting may get raised.\n\nThus checking is prudent.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call 0. So we can check.\n\nThus answer: check.\n\n"

            "reasoning_content": "We have flop: Ks 2s 8s. Our hand: Kh 5h. So we have top pair (K) with a flush draw? Actually board has three spades, we have two hearts, so no flush draw. We have K high, pair of Kings, plus a gutshot? Not really. We have K kicker: King pair, kicker 5. Opponent (Seat2) is BB, checked flop. He is 154 chips, we have 163 chips. Both have similar stacks. He checked, we can check or bet/raise. What is his likely range? He is BB, preflop he just called 4 (big blind) and checked flop. He could have a variety: maybe mid pairs, draws, etc. Board is spade heavy; he may have spade draws. Our hand is decent but vulnerable to overpairs (AQ, AK, etc) but we have K of hearts, not spades. Could be top pair but not strong. We could check to see a turn, but also could bet to protect against draws and get value from worse hands (like weaker K, Q, J, etc). Pot is 10, we have 163 chips, min raise 4. Betting 4 (size of BB) is small, but could be okay.\n\nGiven tournament, medium stack, need to preserve chips but also pick up chips. Opponent's tendencies: from recall, he has raised preflop with 6 chips (hand 16,17) and 12 chips (hand22). He also bet on flop 6 chips (hand20). So he can be aggressive. He also called a 2 chip preflop (hand20). He seems to be willing to bet 6 on flop. So if we bet, he might raise? Hard.\n\nWe have top pair but no kicker advantage vs many. Might consider checking and seeing turn. If turn is a spade, we could be in trouble. If turn is a non-spade, we still have top pair.\n\nThus checking is safe. But we could also bet around 4-6 to protect. Since min raise is 4, raising to 8 would be a raise of 8 total? Actually raise_to total. So we could raise to 8 (i.e., bet 8). That would be 2x pot? Pot 10, bet 8 is less than pot. Might be okay.\n\nGiven opponent checked, maybe they have weak hand and will call a bet. We could extract value. But also risk being raised if he has a stronger hand like AK (but we have K hearts, not spade). He could have K spade? Actually board K spade, we have K hearts, opponent could have K spade (but board already has K spade). So opponent could have K with a spade kicker? Actually board K spade, so any K in hand is second King, but we have one King, board has one King. So opponent could have K? He could have Kx, giving him two pair? No, board K, you have Kh, opponent could have K? That would be K K K? Actually board has one King, we have one King, opponent could have another King, making trips. That's possible. So we have top pair, but opponent could have trips. So betting may get raised.\n\nThus checking is prudent.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call 0. So we can check.\n\nThus answer: check.\n\n",

Pot is 10 chips only? That's weird: preflop small blind 2, big blind 4, we called 4, so pot after preflop is 2+4+4 =10. Flop no betting, turn no betting, so still 10. So we are on turn, amount to call 0, minimum raise 4. Should we bet? Consider opponent's tendencies. We have top pair K, but board is very coordinated: four spades, possible straight draws? Board: K s, 2 s, 8 s, 6 s. Straight possibilities: 9-7? Not there. Could be 7-5 for a straight (7,5). Opponent could have flush (any spade) already on board.

So any spade lower than K gives them a flush, but not nut? The nut flush would be Ace of spades, which beats any other spade. So opponent could have A\u2660 for nut flush. Also any spade gives a flush, which beats our pair. So opponent may have a flush, or could have a straight? Not likely.\n\nOur hand is relatively weak relative to board. We might consider checking and folding to later bets. But we have position and can try to steal pot. However opponent may have a flush and could raise. Our stack is 163, pot 10. We could raise to 4 (minimum) to try to take pot. But risk: if opponent has flush, they'd raise or call? They might call with weak spade? They might have a hand like A\u2660, they would likely raise. So raising may get us called by a flush and we lose more chips. Better to check and see if opponent bets; we can fold if they bet.\n\nGiven our hand is vulnerable, check is safe. Also we have some showdown value if opponent checks again; we could win the pot at showdown with K pair vs maybe opponent's missed draws. But opponent could have a hand like A\u2663 A\u2666?

Their stack 154 chips, they are in BB. They checked all streets, likely they have a weak hand or maybe a draw they missed. Could have a straight? Board: K 2 8 6 8. Possible combos: they could have 8x for trips, or a full house (8-8-8? Actually board has pair of 8s, so a full house would be 8-8-8-K-K? No, board already has pair 8s, one K. If they have Kx they'd have trips K? Actually board has one K, so they could have Kx for pair of Kings (we have same). They could have 8x for trips 8s (but board has two 8s, they need third 8 for trips). There is only one 8 left (8c on board). Actually board has 8s and 8c, that's two 8s. So they could have 8d? Actually there are three 8s total? No, deck has four suits, we have 8s and 8c on board, so remaining 8h and 8d are possible. If they have an 8, they'd have trips (three of a kind). Could also have a straight? Board: K 2 8 6 8. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9? Not possible. 4-5-6-7-8? No 7 missing. So no straight.\n\nFlush: board has four spades (Ks, 2s, 8s, 6s). Actually that's four spades, plus 8c. So any spade in hand gives a flush. We have Kh 5h, no spade. Opponent could have a spade for flush. They checked river, maybe they missed flush draw. Could have a lower flush but they'd likely bet. They could have a full house: K K 8 8 8? Not possible because only one K left (Kc, Kd). If they have Kc they'd have two pair K K and 8 8? Actually board K, we have Kc gives pair of Kings, plus board pair of 8s, that is two pair (K's and 8's). Not full house. Full house would need K K K 8 8 or 8 8 8 K K. Not possible.\n\nSo our hand is top pair K with weak kicker, but board is very coordinated flush heavy. Opponent checked, likely they have nothing. We could check and win. Raising may be a bluff, but opponent might call with a weak hand? They checked all streets, likely they have nothing, maybe a missed draw, maybe a weak pair like 2-2,6-6, etc. Could they have a hand like 8h (makes trips)? If they have 8h they'd have trips, they'd likely bet river. So they probably don't have 8. Could they have Kx? They might have Kc, they'd have two pair (K's and 8's). They might check? Usually they'd bet. So likely they have nothing. So we can check and win. But we could also consider a value bet? But we have only top pair K, not strong vs potential flush. If we bet, they might call with any pair (like 2-2,6-6,8-8? but they'd have 8 they'd bet). Could they call with a lower pair? Maybe they have 6-6 or 2-2, they'd call? They might fold to a bet.

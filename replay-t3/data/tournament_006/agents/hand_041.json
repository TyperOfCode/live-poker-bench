Made a big raise on flop in hand 37 (80 chips). Seems capable of playing back.\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB): Very tight! Folded preflop in 6 out of 10 hands shown. Only called once and raised once. This player is clearly tight.\n\nWith T2o on the button facing a tight BB and an active SB, I should fold this hand. Even though I have position, this hand is just too weak to play. I don't want to invest chips with such a poor hand when I have a decent stack.\n\nThe pot odds are poor (1.5:1), and even if I hit a T or 2, I'm unlikely to win a big pot and could easily be dominated. There's no straight or flush potential worth mentioning.\n\nFolding is the clear decision here.",

This suggests that if I call, I'm likely to face more action from later positions.\n\n**My UTG History**: Looking at my previous UTG hands, I've folded 29 out of 40 (72.5%) and when I do play UTG, it's typically with premium hands like AA, AK. This weak hand doesn't meet my UTG standards.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. 9d 2s from UTG has very little equity against any reasonable range, and calling 8 chips to see a flop is not profitable in the long run.

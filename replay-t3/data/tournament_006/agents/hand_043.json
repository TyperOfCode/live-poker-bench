I have 23.5 BB which is getting into push/fold territory.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** QJo is a decent hand, especially from the button. It's not premium but has good playability.\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is huge advantage - I get to act last postflop.\n3. **Stack size:** 23.5 BB is short enough that I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips.\n4. **Opponent:** Seat 2's raise could be a wide range given they've been folding a lot recently.\n5. **Pot odds:** Pot is 36, I need to call 24. That's 1.5:1 pot odds (40% equity needed).\n6. **Tournament considerations:** I need to accumulate chips soon.\n\nQJo has about 40-45% equity against a typical 3x raise range from MP. With position and implied odds if I hit, this could be a profitable call.\n\nHowever, there are two players left to act: SB (Seat 4) and BB (Seat 5). BB has only 119 chips (14.9 BB) and could be looking to shove. SB has 196 chips.\n\nGiven my stack size and position, I think calling is reasonable. Folding is too tight. Raising doesn't make sense with QJo - I'd rather see a flop in position.\n\nI'll call and use my position advantage postflop."

I have 23.5 BB which is getting into push/fold territory.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** QJo is a decent hand, especially from the button. It's not premium but has good playability.\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is huge advantage - I get to act last postflop.\n3. **Stack size:** 23.5 BB is short enough that I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips.\n4. **Opponent:** Seat 2's raise could be a wide range given they've been folding a lot recently.\n5. **Pot odds:** Pot is 36, I need to call 24. That's 1.5:1 pot odds (40% equity needed).\n6. **Tournament considerations:** I need to accumulate chips soon.\n\nQJo has about 40-45% equity against a typical 3x raise range from MP. With position and implied odds if I hit, this could be a profitable call.\n\nHowever, there are two players left to act: SB (Seat 4) and BB (Seat 5). BB has only 119 chips (14.9 BB) and could be looking to shove. SB has 196 chips.\n\nGiven my stack size and position, I think calling is reasonable. Folding is too tight. Raising doesn't make sense with QJo - I'd rather see a flop in position.\n\nI'll call and use my position advantage postflop.",

On a Ts-5d-9c flop, I have:\n- Open-ended straight draw: Any K or 8 gives me a straight\n- Backdoor flush potential with hearts (Qh is a heart)\n- Overcards: Queen and Jack are both overcards to the board\n- Gutshot straight draw also possible with a 7 for 8-9-T-J-Q straight\n\n**Position advantage:** I'm on the button, which is great. Both opponents have checked to me.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from memory:**\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has shown some aggression - raised preflop here, and in hand 37 raised on flop with 80 chips. In hand 40 bet 24 on flop. Seems to be somewhat aggressive post-flop.\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Mostly passive, tends to fold preflop. Called from SB here, which suggests a decent hand. In hand 39, called from BB then bet small on flop (7 into small pot).\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 80, I can check for free or bet. If I bet, I could take it down now or build the pot for my draws.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 20.5 BB, which is getting short. I need to accumulate chips. This is a good spot to potentially win the pot or improve to a strong hand.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Check:** Free card, but gives opponents free cards too. With my draws, I want to see the turn cheaply.\n2. **Bet:** Take initiative, potentially win the pot now. If called, I have good equity.\n\nGiven my position and the fact that both players checked, a bet makes sense. I should bet around 40-50 chips (half pot to 2/3 pot). This puts pressure on opponents and sets up a good turn bet if I hit.\n\nLet me think about sizing: If I bet 40 chips (half pot), I have 140 left. That's reasonable. If called by both, pot becomes 160, and I have 124 left (less than pot). Could go all-in on turn if I hit.\n\nActually, with my stack size (20.5 BB), I could consider a smaller bet to keep pot manageable. But being on button with two checks, I should bet.\n\nI'll bet 40 chips (half pot). This is enough to put pressure on opponents while not overcommitting with just a draw."

On a Ts-5d-9c flop, I have:\n- Open-ended straight draw: Any K or 8 gives me a straight\n- Backdoor flush potential with hearts (Qh is a heart)\n- Overcards: Queen and Jack are both overcards to the board\n- Gutshot straight draw also possible with a 7 for 8-9-T-J-Q straight\n\n**Position advantage:** I'm on the button, which is great. Both opponents have checked to me.\n\n**Opponent tendencies from memory:**\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has shown some aggression - raised preflop here, and in hand 37 raised on flop with 80 chips. In hand 40 bet 24 on flop. Seems to be somewhat aggressive post-flop.\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Mostly passive, tends to fold preflop. Called from SB here, which suggests a decent hand. In hand 39, called from BB then bet small on flop (7 into small pot).\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 80, I can check for free or bet. If I bet, I could take it down now or build the pot for my draws.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 20.5 BB, which is getting short. I need to accumulate chips. This is a good spot to potentially win the pot or improve to a strong hand.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Check:** Free card, but gives opponents free cards too. With my draws, I want to see the turn cheaply.\n2. **Bet:** Take initiative, potentially win the pot now. If called, I have good equity.\n\nGiven my position and the fact that both players checked, a bet makes sense. I should bet around 40-50 chips (half pot to 2/3 pot). This puts pressure on opponents and sets up a good turn bet if I hit.\n\nLet me think about sizing: If I bet 40 chips (half pot), I have 140 left. That's reasonable. If called by both, pot becomes 160, and I have 124 left (less than pot). Could go all-in on turn if I hit.\n\nActually, with my stack size (20.5 BB), I could consider a smaller bet to keep pot manageable. But being on button with two checks, I should bet.\n\nI'll bet 40 chips (half pot). This is enough to put pressure on opponents while not overcommitting with just a draw.",

Half pot is standard.\n\nActually, with my stack being 164, and pot 80, a bet of 40 leaves me 124 behind. That's about 1.5x pot behind. That's fine.\n\nI'll go with 40.",

            "content": "Now I need to think about the current situation. We're on the turn with Qh Jc on a Ts 5d 9c 3s board. We have a gutshot straight draw (need an 8 for a straight) and a pair of jacks with queen kicker. The pot is 160 chips, we have 124 chips total, and we bet 40 on the flop and got called by MiniMax-M2.\n\nMiniMax-M2 checked to us on the turn. We have position (BTN). Looking at opponent tendencies:\n\n1. MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has been folding a lot preflop (7/10 actions are folds), but called a bet on flop in hand 39 and then checked turn and river. Shows some passive tendencies.\n\n2. The original raiser (seat 2, Kimi-K2) folded on the flop after our bet, so they likely had a weak hand.\n\nOur hand: QJ offsuit. On this board Ts 5d 9c 3s, we have:\n- Pair of jacks (but board has T, 9, 5, 3 - so our jack is overcard to some of the board)\n- Gutshot straight draw to an 8 (8 would give us Q-J-T-9-8 straight)\n- Backdoor flush draw? No, hearts not on board.\n\nWe have 124 chips total. We bet 40 on flop, leaving us with 84 chips. The pot is 160. If we check, we get to see a free river. If we bet, we're committing more chips.\n\nGiven our stack size (15.5 BB), we're getting short. We need to accumulate chips. But we also need to consider that we might be behind. MiniMax-M2 called our flop bet - they could have:\n- A pair of tens or nines\n- A draw (maybe 8-7, J-8, Q-8)\n- A slow-played set\n- A pair with a draw\n\nThe turn 3s is a relatively blank card. It doesn't complete many draws except maybe backdoor spades (but we have no spades).\n\nIf we bet here, we're likely betting for value if we think we're ahead, or as a semi-bluff if we think we can get folds. Given our stack size, we could consider going all-in to maximize fold equity.\n\nHowever, we only have 84 chips left after our flop bet. The pot is 160. If we check, we preserve our stack and see a river. If we bet, we're putting in significant portion of our stack.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: If we bet, say, 40 (half pot), we'd be risking 40 to win 160, giving us 4:1 odds. We need about 20% equity. Against a range of hands that called our flop bet, what's our equity?\n\nLet's estimate: Opponent could have AT, KT, QT, JT, T9, 98, 87, sets (TT, 99, 55), two pair (T9, T5, 95). Our equity against this range is probably around 25-30% with our pair + gutshot. Actually, let me think more carefully.\n\nWe have 5 outs to improve: 4 eights for the straight, and 3 queens or 3 jacks (but some might be dirty outs if opponent has QJ, QT, etc.). So maybe 5-8 outs total.\n\nIf we check, we get to see a river for free and can decide then. Given our short stack and tournament situation, maybe checking is better to preserve chips and see if we hit.\n\nBut we also have position. If we check back, we give opponent a free card. They could have a draw that we want to charge.\n\nActually, I think betting might be better. We have some fold equity, and if we get called, we still have outs. Our stack is short enough that we might want to commit now rather than later.\n\nBut wait, we only have 84 chips left. The pot is 160. If we bet 40, we leave 44 behind for river. That's awkward. Maybe better to go all-in now? Minimum raise is 40, but we could raise to our full stack (124 total, so raise to 124 means putting in 84 more).\n\nLet me check the math: We have 124 total. We already put in 24 preflop + 40 flop = 64. So we have 60 left? Wait, recalc: Starting stack 124. We called 24 preflop (100 left). Bet 40 on flop (60 left). Yes, we have 60 chips left, not 84. My mistake.\n\nSo we have 60 chips left. Pot is "

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to think about the current situation. We're on the turn with Qh Jc on a Ts 5d 9c 3s board. We have a gutshot straight draw (need an 8 for a straight) and a pair of jacks with queen kicker. The pot is 160 chips, we have 124 chips total, and we bet 40 on the flop and got called by MiniMax-M2.\n\nMiniMax-M2 checked to us on the turn. We have position (BTN). Looking at opponent tendencies:\n\n1. MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has been folding a lot preflop (7/10 actions are folds), but called a bet on flop in hand 39 and then checked turn and river. Shows some passive tendencies.\n\n2. The original raiser (seat 2, Kimi-K2) folded on the flop after our bet, so they likely had a weak hand.\n\nOur hand: QJ offsuit. On this board Ts 5d 9c 3s, we have:\n- Pair of jacks (but board has T, 9, 5, 3 - so our jack is overcard to some of the board)\n- Gutshot straight draw to an 8 (8 would give us Q-J-T-9-8 straight)\n- Backdoor flush draw? No, hearts not on board.\n\nWe have 124 chips total. We bet 40 on flop, leaving us with 84 chips. The pot is 160. If we check, we get to see a free river. If we bet, we're committing more chips.\n\nGiven our stack size (15.5 BB), we're getting short. We need to accumulate chips. But we also need to consider that we might be behind. MiniMax-M2 called our flop bet - they could have:\n- A pair of tens or nines\n- A draw (maybe 8-7, J-8, Q-8)\n- A slow-played set\n- A pair with a draw\n\nThe turn 3s is a relatively blank card. It doesn't complete many draws except maybe backdoor spades (but we have no spades).\n\nIf we bet here, we're likely betting for value if we think we're ahead, or as a semi-bluff if we think we can get folds. Given our stack size, we could consider going all-in to maximize fold equity.\n\nHowever, we only have 84 chips left after our flop bet. The pot is 160. If we check, we preserve our stack and see a river. If we bet, we're putting in significant portion of our stack.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: If we bet, say, 40 (half pot), we'd be risking 40 to win 160, giving us 4:1 odds. We need about 20% equity. Against a range of hands that called our flop bet, what's our equity?\n\nLet's estimate: Opponent could have AT, KT, QT, JT, T9, 98, 87, sets (TT, 99, 55), two pair (T9, T5, 95). Our equity against this range is probably around 25-30% with our pair + gutshot. Actually, let me think more carefully.\n\nWe have 5 outs to improve: 4 eights for the straight, and 3 queens or 3 jacks (but some might be dirty outs if opponent has QJ, QT, etc.). So maybe 5-8 outs total.\n\nIf we check, we get to see a river for free and can decide then. Given our short stack and tournament situation, maybe checking is better to preserve chips and see if we hit.\n\nBut we also have position. If we check back, we give opponent a free card. They could have a draw that we want to charge.\n\nActually, I think betting might be better. We have some fold equity, and if we get called, we still have outs. Our stack is short enough that we might want to commit now rather than later.\n\nBut wait, we only have 84 chips left. The pot is 160. If we bet 40, we leave 44 behind for river. That's awkward. Maybe better to go all-in now? Minimum raise is 40, but we could raise to our full stack (124 total, so raise to 124 means putting in 84 more).\n\nLet me check the math: We have 124 total. We already put in 24 preflop + 40 flop = 64. So we have 60 left? Wait, recalc: Starting stack 124. We called 24 preflop (100 left). Bet 40 on flop (60 left). Yes, we have 60 chips left, not 84. My mistake.\n\nSo we have 60 chips left. Pot is ",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me think about this hand. We're on the turn with Qh Jc on Ts 5d 9c 3s board. We have 124 chips total. We've put in 24 preflop and 40 on flop, so we have 60 chips left (124 - 24 - 40 = 60). Pot is 160 chips.\n\nMiniMax-M2 checked to us. We have position. Our hand: pair of jacks with queen kicker, gutshot straight draw (need 8). We have 5 clean outs to a straight (4 eights). Possibly 3 more outs if our queen or jack are good (but opponent could have QJ, QT, JT, etc.).\n\nOpponent called our flop bet. They could have:\n- Middle pair (T9, T8, T7, etc.)\n- Top pair weak kicker (T with weak kicker)\n- Draw (87, 86, J8, Q8)\n- Slow-played set\n- Two pair\n\nThe turn 3s is relatively blank. It doesn't complete many draws.\n\nGiven our stack size (60 chips left, pot 160), we're getting short. We have fold equity if we bet. If we check, we see a free river but give opponent a free card if they're drawing.\n\nIf we bet, we should consider sizing. Minimum raise is 40 (total bet size). We could bet 40 (half pot), leaving 20 behind for river. Or go all-in (bet 60, which is less than minimum raise? Actually minimum raise to 40 means we need to raise to at least 80 total? Wait, let me check: \"Minimum raise to: 40\" - this likely means the minimum bet is 40 chips (since amount to call is 0). So we can bet any amount from 40 to all-in.\n\nIf we bet 40, we risk 40 to win 160, getting 4:1 odds. We need ~20% equity. We likely have around 25-30% equity against calling range.\n\nBut we also have fold equity. If opponent folds, we win 160 chips immediately.\n\nGiven tournament situation and short stack, I think betting is better than checking. We want to accumulate chips. Checking gives up potential value and fold equity.\n\nAll-in might be good too, but betting 40 (half pot) might get calls from weaker hands while still having fold equity. If we go all-in (60), it's only 20 more than 40, so not much difference.\n\nActually, let me reconsider: We have 60 chips left. Pot is 160. If we bet 40, pot becomes 200, and we have 20 left. On river, we'd have 20 chips vs pot of 200 - we're essentially committed anyway.\n\nMaybe better to go all-in now? But all-in is only 60 vs 40 bet - not much difference in fold equity.\n\nWait, let me check opponent tendencies. From recall_opponent_actions, MiniMax-M2 tends to check on turn (4/6 times checked). Only once bet small amount (2 chips in hand 7). Shows passive tendencies. They might fold to a bet on turn if they're weak.\n\nGiven our hand has some showdown value (pair of jacks) and draw, I think betting for protection and value is good. We want to get folds from weaker draws or middle pairs.\n\nI'll bet 40 (half pot).

While not premium, it has potential to make straights, flushes, and two pairs. The Q-high gives some showdown value.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom my memory, both Kimi-K2 and DeepSeek-V3.2 have been quite passive preflop, mostly folding and occasionally calling. This suggests they may have tighter, more conservative ranges.\n\n**Stack & Position Considerations:**\n- At 24.5 BB, I have a healthy stack size\n- I'm out of position, which is a disadvantage\n- The pot odds are attractive (60:20 = 3:1)\n- Calling 20 chips is about 10% of my stack, which is manageable\n\n**Decision:**\nWith decent pot odds, suited connector potential, and facing what appears to be passive opponents, this is a reasonable call. Qc 6c has enough equity in a multi-way pot to justify the call, especially given the 3:1 odds. If I hit a flush or straight, I can potentially win a nice pot from these passive players.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Qc 6c is a playable suited connector with decent equity.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand situation carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in the SB (Seat 4) with Qc 6c\n- My stack: 196 chips (24.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 60 chips\n- Amount to call: 20\n- Minimum raise to: 40\n\n**Actions so far:**\n- Seat 1: folded\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): raised to 24\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): called 24\n- Now it's my turn to act\n\n**Hand Analysis - Qc 6c:**\nThis is a suited connector with potential. Qc 6c has some decent playability:\n- Suited connector with straight potential\n- Can make straights, flushes, and two pairs\n- Q-high gives some showdown value\n- Not premium but playable in multi-way pots\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom my recall:\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has been quite passive preflop (mostly folding, some calling). One showdown showed 9h Jc which was weak. This suggests they might be playing relatively tight/passive.\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3): Also quite passive, mostly folding. One raise to 14 chips in hand 38. Generally seems to avoid confrontation.\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\n- I'm at 24.5 BB, which is a decent stack size\n- Not short stacked yet, but need to be mindful of preservation\n- Calling 20 chips represents about 10% of my stack\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 60 chips, I need to call 20\n- Pot odds are 3:1 (60:20)\n- This means I need about 25% equity to make a profitable call\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Position**: I'm out of position, which is a disadvantage\n\n\n2. **Hand strength**: Qc 6c has decent potential in multi-way pots\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents seem passive, which could mean weaker ranges\n4. **Stack depth**: At 24.5 BB, I can afford to see a flop\n5. **Pot odds**: Good odds to call with suited connector\n\nThe multi-way pot with passive opponents makes Qc 6c more attractive. The 3:1 pot odds provide solid justification for calling, especially considering the hand's potential to improve. With decent stack depth and the ability to see a cheap flop, this seems like a reasonable call that could lead to profitable post-flop play.\n\nThe suited connector offers multiple drawing opportunities, and the passive nature of my opponents suggests I might get good value if I hit a strong hand. I'm comfortable risking 20 chips to potentially win a larger pot.\n",

Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: K5 offsuit in BB facing a 3x raise from UTG? Actually seat2 likely early position (maybe UTG). Stack is short (15 BB). K5 offsuit is weak. Opponent raise size moderate. Others called. So likely we should fold. But maybe we could call to see flop with decent implied odds? K5 offsuit is not great. At 15 BB, we want to preserve chips. Also we have 5h and Ks, not suited. Potential to make top pair K, but many players in hand. I think fold.\n\nWe could also consider opponent's raise tendencies: Kimi-K2 raise amounts historically 6,20,6,6,12,12. So they sometimes raise small (3bb) and sometimes larger (20). Here raise is 24 (3x BB). That's typical. Not a huge raise. But still, K5 is weak.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

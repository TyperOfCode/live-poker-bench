I need to call 2 more chips (since I already posted 1 as SB, and the raise is to 4 total, so I need 3 more but I've already put in 1, so 2 more).\n\nPot is currently: SB (1) + BB (2) + Seat 4 raise (4) + Seat 2 call (4) = 11 chips? Wait, let me recalculate: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 4, call 4 = 11 chips. But the display says pot is 10 chips. Actually, Seat 2 had to call 3 more (since they posted SB 1), so total pot would be: SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 4 + call 3 = 10 chips. Yes.\n\nSo I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 10 chips. That's 5:1 pot odds, which is excellent. However, I'm out of position for the rest of the hand (playing from SB), which is a significant disadvantage.\n\nMy hand, 4s6s, is a suited connector. It plays well in multiway pots and can make strong hands, but it needs the right flop. With 5:1 odds, it's tempting to call. But I need to consider:\n\n1. Position: Terrible - I'll be first to act on every street except preflop\n2. Stack sizes: I have 198 chips (99 BB), opponents have similar stacks\n3. Tournament stage: Early with deep stacks\n4. Hand strength: Weak preflop but good implied odds if I hit\n\nThe raise came from Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2), and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called. I don't have any history on these opponents yet. A min-raise from Seat 4 could be a wide range. Seat 2's call could also be wide.\n\nGiven the excellent pot odds (5:1), I should probably call with this suited connector. Even though position is bad, the price is right. I could also consider raising, but 64s is too weak to 3-bet from the SB, especially against a min-raise and a caller. Raising would bloat the pot out of position with a weak hand.\n\nFolding would be too tight given these odds. Suited connectors need good pot odds to play, and 5:1 is excellent.\n\nI should call and see a flop. If I hit a strong draw or made hand, I can continue. If I miss completely, I can check-fold.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations... Actually, wait - I'm in the SB, so after me, the BB still has to act. But the BB is Seat 4 who already raised, so no, that's done. Actually, Seat 4 is the button? Let me check positions: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 is SB? No, I'm Seat 3 (SB). Seat 4 is BB? Actually the positions: Seat 2 posted SB, I posted BB, Seat 4 raised... So Seat 4 is UTG or MP?

I also have a gutshot straight draw (need a 5 for a straight), but that's not very strong.\n\nThe pot is 20 chips, and I need to call 8 chips. That's pot odds of 8 to win 28 (20+8), or about 28.6%. My equity is likely low - with a flush draw and gutshot, I might have around 15-20% equity. However, I also have position being on the button, which is an advantage.\n\nThe opponent MiniMax-M2 raised preflop from UTG+1 (seat 4) and bet 8 on the flop. This could be a continuation bet with a strong range. I don't have any history on this opponent.\n\nGiven my weak hand, I should fold. The pot odds aren't great, and I'm drawing to very weak hands. Even if I hit my flush draw on the turn, I could still lose to a higher flush since hearts are on board. The gutshot straight is also weak.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 196 chips (98 BB), so I have plenty of chips to wait for better spots. No need to chase weak draws here.\n\nLet me calculate more precisely: With 4s 6s on Th Qh 7s, I have:\n- Backdoor flush draw (2 cards to come): ~4% for flush\n- Gutshot straight draw: ~8.5% for straight (4 outs)\n- Pairing one of my cards: ~12% (6 outs, but weak pairs)\n\nTotal maybe ~20% equity at best. Pot odds require ~28.6%, so it's a fold.\n\nAlso, if I call and miss on the turn, I'll likely face another bet and have to fold. Implied odds aren't great either since my draws aren't very hidden or strong.\n\nDecision: Fold."

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this hand. I'm on the button with 4s 6s, a very weak hand. The board is Th Qh 7s. I have a backdoor flush draw with spades, but the board has hearts which could give someone else a flush draw. I also have a gutshot straight draw (need a 5 for a straight), but that's not very strong.\n\nThe pot is 20 chips, and I need to call 8 chips. That's pot odds of 8 to win 28 (20+8), or about 28.6%. My equity is likely low - with a flush draw and gutshot, I might have around 15-20% equity. However, I also have position being on the button, which is an advantage.\n\nThe opponent MiniMax-M2 raised preflop from UTG+1 (seat 4) and bet 8 on the flop. This could be a continuation bet with a strong range. I don't have any history on this opponent.\n\nGiven my weak hand, I should fold. The pot odds aren't great, and I'm drawing to very weak hands. Even if I hit my flush draw on the turn, I could still lose to a higher flush since hearts are on board. The gutshot straight is also weak.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 196 chips (98 BB), so I have plenty of chips to wait for better spots. No need to chase weak draws here.\n\nLet me calculate more precisely: With 4s 6s on Th Qh 7s, I have:\n- Backdoor flush draw (2 cards to come): ~4% for flush\n- Gutshot straight draw: ~8.5% for straight (4 outs)\n- Pairing one of my cards: ~12% (6 outs, but weak pairs)\n\nTotal maybe ~20% equity at best. Pot odds require ~28.6%, so it's a fold.\n\nAlso, if I call and miss on the turn, I'll likely face another bet and have to fold. Implied odds aren't great either since my draws aren't very hidden or strong.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

My hand is weak: backdoor flush draw, gutshot straight draw. Pot odds are 8 to win 28 (20+8) = 28.6% equity needed. My actual equity is maybe ~20% at best. Position is good but hand is too weak. Tournament stack is healthy at 98 BB. Opponent raised preflop from UTG+1 and bet flop, likely has a strong range. Should fold.\n\nI need to output JSON.

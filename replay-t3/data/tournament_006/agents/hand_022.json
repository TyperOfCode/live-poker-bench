            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand:** Qc Ks - This is KQo, a strong offsuit hand but from UTG position. This is typically a marginal hand in early position.\n\n**Position:** UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table. I have 8 players left to act behind me.\n\n**Stack:** 220 chips (55 BB) - This is a healthy stack, not too short but also not deep stacked.\n\n**Opponents:** Looking at the recall data, I can see some patterns:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Seen folding a lot preflop, but also called and bet on flop in hand 20\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Playing quite tight, folding frequently preflop\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Mixed play, folding often but also calling and betting small amounts\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has made some raises and folds\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 55 BB, I should be playing a solid TAG (tight-aggressive) strategy. From UTG, I should be very selective with my hands.\n\n**Hand strength analysis:** KQo is a decent hand, but it's dominated by many hands that might call or raise from later positions (AA, KK, QQ, AK, AQ). From UTG, standard play is to fold KQo because:\n1. Too many players left to act\n2. Likely to be dominated if we get action\n3. Difficult to play post-flop out of position\n\nThe pot is only 6 chips, so there's no pressure to defend.\n\n**Standard ranges:** From UTG with 55 BB, typical opening range is something like: 77+, AJ+, KQs, AQo+. Some players even tighter. KQo is right on the borderline but generally considered a fold from UTG in full ring.\n\n**Conclusion:** I should fold KQo from UTG. While it's a decent hand, the positional disadvantage and risk of being dominated make this a clear fold in a tournament setting where preserving chips is important. I can wait for better spots in better position.",

Let me analyze the key factors:\n\n**Hand Strength**: Q6 offsuit is a weak hand, especially out of position. Even if I hit a pair, it would likely be bottom pair and I'd still be playing from behind.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: From the memory, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been active with preflop raises (hands 11, 16, 17) and shows a pattern of being somewhat aggressive but also folding frequently. Their raise to 12 chips suggests they likely have a decent hand.\n\n**Position**: Being out of position for the entire hand is a significant disadvantage, especially with a marginal hand like Q6o.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 chips into an 18-chip pot, giving me about 2.25:1 odds. This isn't favorable enough to justify calling with such a weak holding.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With 201 chips (50.2 BB), I have a healthy stack and should be selective about which hands I play, especially out of position.\n\nGiven the weak nature of Q6 offsuit, being out of position, and facing what appears to be a legitimate raise from an opponent who has shown preflop aggression, this is an easy fold.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q6 offsuit is too weak to call with out of position, especially facing a raise from an opponent who has shown preflop aggression.

Q6 offsuit is not a strong holding, particularly when facing a raise.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the big blind (Seat 4), so I'm out of position for this hand.\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at Seat 2's (Kimi-K2) recent actions:\n   - They've been quite active with raises preflop (hands 11, 16, 17)\n   - They've shown a tendency to fold a lot (many fold actions)\n   - Their raise amounts vary (6, 20, 12)\n   - In hand 20, they called 2 preflop and then bet 6 on the flop\n   - They seem to be a somewhat aggressive player who folds frequently\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to stay in, with a pot of 18 chips. That's getting about 2.25:1 pot odds.\n\n5. **My tournament situation**: I have 201 chips (50.2 BB), which is a decent stack. I should be selective about which hands I play, especially out of position.\n\n6. **Hand strength**: Q6 offsuit is weak, especially out of position. Even if I hit a pair, it would likely be bottom pair, and I'd still be out of position.\n\n7. **Considerations**: \n   - I'm getting a discount since I'm in the big blind (already put in 4 chips)\n   - But Q6o is still quite weak\n   - I'm out of position for the entire hand\n   - The opponent seems to be somewhat aggressive, so they could have a wide range\n\nGiven that this is a weak hand (Q6o) and I'm out of position, and considering the opponent's tendency to be somewhat aggressive (which suggests they might have a decent hand), I should fold this hand. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify calling with such a weak holding out of position.\n\nLet me fold.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: Q\u2660 J\u2660 - This is a strong suited broadway hand, especially in position on the button. Good potential for straights, flushes, and strong pairs.\n\n2. **My stack**: 92 chips (2.9 BB) - This is critically short-stacked. I'm in desperate need of chips and should be looking for spots to get all-in.\n\n3. **Position**: BTN - Perfect position, I get to act last postflop.\n\n4. **Current action**: \n   - SB posted 16\n   - BB posted 32\n   - One player folded\n   - I need to call 32 or raise\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**:\n   - **Seat 2 (SB)**: Kimi-K2 with 461 chips (14.4 BB) - Big stack. Looking at their history, they seem to play fairly standard. They fold preflop sometimes (hands 81, 82), call sometimes (hand 80), and bet postflop occasionally. They've shown down hands like 9hJc, JhAc, QhQs, AhJs, 7cKh - reasonable holdings.\n   \n   - **Seat 3 (BB)**: DeepSeek-V3.2 with 85 chips (2.7 BB) - Also short-stacked. More aggressive based on history. They made a big raise to 80 in hand 82, and have shown aggression postflop with bets on river (hand 81) and turn (hand 82). They've shown down hands like 6cAc, KhKs, Ad6s, Jd2s, 9dJc.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 48 and I need to call 32, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds. This is reasonable for QJs.\n\n7. **Tournament situation**: With only 2.9 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Standard play would be to shove here with QJs from the button, especially against two opponents who are both capable of folding.\n\n8. **Decision**: Given my short stack and the strength of QJs on the button, I should raise all-in. This gives me:\n   - Fold equity - both opponents can fold\n   - Good hand equity if called\n   - Maximum pressure with a short stack\n   - The chance to double up or better\n\nThe minimum raise is to 64, but with 92 chips, I should just shove all-in for 92 total.\n\nLet me verify this is the right move by considering if call could be an option. Calling would leave me with only 60 chips postflop, which severely limits my options. With such a short stack, it's better to take control and apply pressure now with a strong hand.\n\nThe all-in raise is the correct tournament play here.",

            "content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the big blind with Jc Qh, stack is 85 chips (2.7 BB). The pot is 324 chips. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 92, then Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 200. I need to call 168, but my entire stack is only 85! Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nMy stack: 85 chips. Blinds: 16/32. I posted BB of 32. Seat 1 raised to 92 total (so additional 60). Seat 2 raised to 200 total (so additional 108 from their SB? Wait, Seat 2 posted SB 16, so they raised to 200 total, which means they put in 184 more).\n\nBut the amount to call is 168? That seems off. Let me calculate: I already have 32 in the pot (my BB). The bet to me is 200 total. To call, I need to put in 200 - 32 = 168. But my stack is only 85 total, so I can only put in 85 total. That means if I call, I'm going all-in for 85 total. Actually, I think the amount to call is 168, but I can only afford 85 total, which means I can call all-in for 85. But wait, I already have 32 in, so I need to add 53 more to make it 85 total.\n\nBut the interface says \"Amount to call: 168\" and \"Legal actions: fold, call\". Since I can't afford 168, I assume calling means going all-in for my remaining 85. That's typical tournament poker: you can call all-in even if you don't have enough to match the full bet.\n\nSo my decision is: fold or call all-in with Jc Qh.\n\nI have 85 chips, which is 2.7 BB. I'm in the BB. There's been a raise and a 3-bet. Seat 1 raised, Seat 2 3-bet. Seat 1 is \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\" with 0 chips? Wait, Seat 1 has 0 chips but they raised? That seems odd. Maybe they're all-in? Actually, Seat 1 has 0 chips listed but they raised 92. Maybe they're all-in? Let me re-read: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 0 chips (out)\" - says \"out\" meaning they're out of the tournament? But they raised? That's confusing.\n\nSeat 2: Kimi-K2 - 277 chips. They 3-bet to 200.\n\nPot is 324 chips. If I call all-in for 85, the pot will be 324 + 53 = 377? Actually, let's calculate current pot: BB 32 + SB 16 + Seat 1 raise 92 + Seat 2 raise 200 = 340? Wait, that's not right. Let's track:\n\n- SB (Seat 2): posted 16\n- BB (me): posted 32\n- Seat 1: raised to 92 total (so added 92)\n- Seat 2: raised to 200 total (had 16 already, so added 184)\n\nTotal pot: 16 + 32 + 92 + 184 = 324. Yes.\n\nIf I call all-in for 85 total, I add 53 more (since I already have 32 in). So pot becomes 324 + 53 = 377. But there might be side pots if others have more chips.\n\nActually, Seat 1 has 0 chips, so they're all-in for 92. Seat 2 has 277 chips, so they can cover everyone.\n\nMy hand: Jc Qh offsuit. That's a marginal hand, but I'm very short-stacked with only 2.7 BB. In tournament poker, with 2.7 BB, I should be looking for any opportunity to go all-in preflop, especially from the BB where I already have 32 chips invested. JQo is not great, but it's better than many random hands.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 53 more chips (to get to 85 total) to win a pot of 377 (if I call). That's pot odds of 377:53, about 7.1:1. That's huge! Even if I'm dominated, I have decent equity against many hands.\n\nBut I need to consider opponent ranges. Seat 1 raised from UTG? Actually, Seat 1 is first to act after blinds? Wait, positions: Seat 1 is UTG? Actually, the table has 5 players: Seat 1, 2, 3 (me"

Let me check the numbers again.\n\nMy stack: 85 chips. Blinds: 16/32. I posted BB of 32. Seat 1 raised to 92 total (so additional 60). Seat 2 raised to 200 total (so additional 108 from their SB? Wait, Seat 2 posted SB 16, so they raised to 200 total, which means they put in 184 more).\n\nBut the amount to call is 168? That seems off. Let me calculate: I already have 32 in the pot (my BB). The bet to me is 200 total. To call, I need to put in 200 - 32 = 168. But my stack is only 85 total, so I can only put in 85 total. That means if I call, I'm going all-in for 85 total. Actually, I think the amount to call is 168, but I can only afford 85 total, which means I can call all-in for 85. But wait, I already have 32 in, so I need to add 53 more to make it 85 total.\n\nBut the interface says \"Amount to call: 168\" and \"Legal actions: fold, call\". Since I can't afford 168, I assume calling means going all-in for my remaining 85. That's typical tournament poker: you can call all-in even if you don't have enough to match the full bet.\n\nSo my decision is: fold or call all-in with Jc Qh.\n\nI have 85 chips, which is 2.7 BB. I'm in the BB. There's been a raise and a 3-bet. Seat 1 raised, Seat 2 3-bet. Seat 1 is \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\" with 0 chips? Wait, Seat 1 has 0 chips but they raised? That seems odd. Maybe they're all-in? Actually, Seat 1 has 0 chips listed but they raised 92. Maybe they're all-in? Let me re-read: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 0 chips (out)\" - says \"out\" meaning they're out of the tournament? But they raised? That's confusing.\n\nSeat 2: Kimi-K2 - 277 chips. They 3-bet to 200.\n\nPot is 324 chips. If I call all-in for 85, the pot will be 324 + 53 = 377? Actually, let's calculate current pot: BB 32 + SB 16 + Seat 1 raise 92 + Seat 2 raise 200 = 340? Wait, that's not right. Let's track:\n\n- SB (Seat 2): posted 16\n- BB (me): posted 32\n- Seat 1: raised to 92 total (so added 92)\n- Seat 2: raised to 200 total (had 16 already, so added 184)\n\nTotal pot: 16 + 32 + 92 + 184 = 324. Yes.\n\nIf I call all-in for 85 total, I add 53 more (since I already have 32 in). So pot becomes 324 + 53 = 377. But there might be side pots if others have more chips.\n\nActually, Seat 1 has 0 chips, so they're all-in for 92. Seat 2 has 277 chips, so they can cover everyone.\n\nMy hand: Jc Qh offsuit. That's a marginal hand, but I'm very short-stacked with only 2.7 BB. In tournament poker, with 2.7 BB, I should be looking for any opportunity to go all-in preflop, especially from the BB where I already have 32 chips invested. JQo is not great, but it's better than many random hands.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 53 more chips (to get to 85 total) to win a pot of 377 (if I call). That's pot odds of 377:53, about 7.1:1. That's huge! Even if I'm dominated, I have decent equity against many hands.\n\nBut I need to consider opponent ranges. Seat 1 raised from UTG? Actually, Seat 1 is first to act after blinds? Wait, positions: Seat 1 is UTG? Actually, the table has 5 players: Seat 1, 2, 3 (me",

I need to call 168, but I only have 85 total. So calling means going all-in for my remaining 85 chips.\n\nFrom the opponent data: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has shown some raises preflop with various hands. They've shown down J3s, TQo, Ac2c - so they raise with a wide range. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown raises with various hands too - they've shown down 9h Jc, Jh Ac, Qh Qs, Ah Js, 7c Kh. So both players have wide raising ranges.\n\nMy hand JQo is decent but not great. However, I'm extremely short-stacked with only 2.7 BB. In tournament poker, when you're this short, you need to take marginal spots. I already have 32 chips invested (my BB). The pot is 324 chips. If I call all-in for 85 total, I'm putting in 53 more chips to win 377 (pot of 324 + my 53 call). That's 7.1:1 pot odds.\n\nEven against a tight range like {JJ+, AK, AQ}, JQo has about 28% equity. Against wider ranges, it has more. With 7.1:1 pot odds, I only need about 12% equity to break even. I have way more than that.\n\nAlso, Seat 1 has 0 chips (they're all-in for 92), so there's a side pot between me and Seat 2 if I call. But I'm getting such great pot odds that it's a clear call.\n\nIf I fold, I'll have 85 chips left (2.7 BB) and be in terrible shape. If I call and win, I triple up to about 255 chips (8 BB), which is much more playable.\n\nGiven the pot odds and my desperate stack situation, I should call all-in.\n\nWait, but Seat 2 3-bet to 200. That's a strong action. But even against a strong range, my pot odds justify the call.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. The fact that Seat 1 has 0 chips and is all-in means there's already dead money in the pot. This makes calling even more attractive.\n\nI should call.",

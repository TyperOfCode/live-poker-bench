            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent data:\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**: Very tight - they've folded 7 out of 10 recent preflop actions. Only called once and raised once. This player is clearly playing very tight.\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**: Also very tight - folded 8 out of 10 times preflop, with one raise and one flop bet. Very conservative player.\n\n**Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)**: Moderately tight - folded 7 out of 10 times, but did call once and raise once. They posted the small blind this hand.\n\n**Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)**: Moderately aggressive - folded 6 out of 10 times, but has raised twice (including to 12 chips) and made a call. They posted the big blind this hand.\n\nNow analyzing my situation:\n- **Hand**: 9d 8c (suited connector, off-suit)\n- **Position**: UTG (worst position)\n- **Stack**: 262 chips (65.5 BB)\n- **Blinds**: 2/4\n- **To call**: 4 chips\n\nWith 9-8 offsuit from UTG position, this is a marginal hand at best. I need to consider:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 9-8 offsuit is a weak hand from early position. It has some straight potential but no suit connectivity. It's easily dominated by higher cards.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be acting first on every street with 4 players left to act behind me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: The players behind me are relatively tight (especially seats 2 and 3), but seat 5 has shown aggression. However, given the tight nature of most players, if I limp in, I might face raises.\n\n4. **Stack size**: With 65.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack and tight opponents, I should be selective. 9-8 offsuit from UTG is not a profitable hand to play, especially when I could face a raise from the aggressive player in seat 5.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: 4 chips to call into a 6 chip pot = 2:3 odds or 40% equity needed. Even against random hands, 9-8 offsuit doesn't have this equity, especially out of position.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold. This is a clear fold from UTG with a marginal hand like 9-8 offsuit. The position disadvantage, combined with the hand's weakness and the potential for facing aggression from behind, makes this an easy fold. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 3h 4s. This is a very weak hand - 3-4 offsuit. The blinds are 2/4, and I have 206 chips (51.5 BB). Both players ahead have folded, so it's just me, the SB (MiniMax-M2), and BB (GPT-OSS-120B).\n\nFrom the opponent data I gathered:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB) has been folding a lot recently (folded hands 20-25, 27). In hand 26 they raised to 8 from SB, and in hand 19 they called SB and then bet flop.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB) has been folding frequently but showed some aggression in hands 25 and 27 with raises to 12.\n\nMy hand is terrible - 3-4 offsuit has very little equity. However, I'm on the button which is the best position. The pot is 6 chips, and it costs me 4 to call. I could consider a steal attempt since both blinds have shown tendencies to fold, but with such a weak hand, raising would be risky.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6, which gives me 1.5:1 pot odds (40% equity needed). My hand definitely doesn't have 40% equity against random hands.\n\nHowever, position is valuable. If I just call, I'll be playing a multi-way pot out of position with a terrible hand. That's not good either.\n\nLooking at stack sizes: I have 206, SB has 199, BB has 169. We're all relatively deep (40-50 BB).\n\nGiven the terrible hand strength, the correct play is to fold. Even though I have position, 3-4 offsuit is just too weak to play, especially with players behind who might have legitimate hands. The SB and BB could wake up with strong hands.\n\nIn tournament poker, preserving my stack is important. Playing 3-4o from the button is generally a fold unless I'm trying to steal from very tight opponents. While the opponents have shown some folding tendencies, my hand is so weak that even if I raise and get called, I'll be in a tough spot postflop.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot. Fold.",

Actually blinds are part of pot: SB 2, BB 4, plus call 2 from seat4 = 2, plus seat5 check 0, total 8. But given pot is 12 chips on flop, maybe there were antes? But ignore. They bet 4, making pot 16 after bet? Actually amount to call is 4.\n\nOur stack 169, we have 42 BB. We need decide to call, raise, or fold. Hand strength is weak. Opponent's bet size is small (half pot). Could be continuation bet with many hands. We have a pair of 4s, but board has Qc, 7c, 4c. Opponent could have Qx, 7x, 4x, flush draw, etc. Our pair is low. Likely fold.\n\nBut consider if opponent is short stack 193 chips, maybe they are trying to steal? Not sure. Check opponent tendencies: we have recall of two previous flop bets: hand 1 bet 8 (bigger) and hand 19 bet 2 (small). So variable. No pattern.\n\nThus fold seems appropriate.\n\nReturn JSON.",

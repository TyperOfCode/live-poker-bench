In early position with QQ, I should make a standard raise to:\n1. Build the pot with a strong hand\n2. Isolate against fewer opponents\n3. Define the strength of opponents' hands\n4. Extract value from weaker hands that might call\n\nA standard raise from early position would be 3x-4x the big blind. Given the 2 chip BB, I should raise to 6-8 chips. I'll go with 8 chips (4x BB) as a solid, standard raise.\n\nThis is a clear raise situation - I have a premium hand and want to get value while protecting against overcards on the flop.",

This is a marginal hand from the BTN.\n2. **Position**: BTN (button) - best position at the table.\n3. **Opponent action**: Seat 1 (UTG?) raised to 8 (4x BB). Looking at opponent history: Kimi-K2 Thinking has folded 6 times, checked 3 times, and raised once before (hand #6). They've been playing tight.\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 11 (1 SB + 2 BB + 8 raise). To call 8, we need ~42% equity. A9o vs a tight UTG raising range likely has less than this.\n5. **Stack sizes**: I have 212 chips (106 BB), healthy stack. Opponent has 197 chips.\n6. **Tournament considerations**: We're deep stacked, no need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands.\n\nLooking at the opponent's only previous raise (hand #6), we don't have showdown info. But given their tight folding pattern, their raising range from early position is likely strong: probably 77+, AJs+, AQo+, maybe KQs. Against that range, A9o has poor equity.\n\nHowever, we're on the button with position. We could consider calling to play postflop in position, but A9o doesn't play well multi-way and we still have blinds to act behind us.\n\nBetter to fold here. A9o is too weak to call an UTG raise from a tight player, even with position. We have plenty of chips and can wait for better spots.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A9o is too weak against a tight UTG raiser (Kimi-K2 Thinking) who has shown a folding-heavy pattern. Pot odds don't justify calling with marginal hand despite good position. Better to preserve stack for stronger spots.\"\n}",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My Hand**: Ad8h - This is Ace-high, which is a decent hand but not premium. The kicker is weak (8 vs higher cards could be problematic).\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the Small Blind (SB), which is not ideal for playing marginal hands like A8o.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Kimi-K2 Thinking raised to 8 chips preflop. From my memory, this player has shown a tendency to raise preflop (I found one previous raise to 8 chips). This suggests they might be an aggressive player or have a decent hand.\n\n4. **Situation**: \n   - Current pot: 11 chips\n   - Amount to call: 7 chips (to match the 8 chip raise, since I already posted 1 chip as SB)\n   - My stack: 204 chips (102 BB)\n   - Opponent's stack: 197 chips\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: I'm at about 100+ BB stack, so I have room to play. However, A8o is not a strong hand to call a raise with, especially from the SB.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I'd be getting about 11:7 odds (pot is 11, I need to call 7), which is roughly 1.6:1. This means I need about 38% equity to make a profitable call.\n\n7. **Hand Strength**: A8o vs a typical raising range would likely be behind. Against a reasonable range of hands that raise to 8 chips, A8o probably has less than 38% equity.\n\n8. **Position Disadvantage**: Being in the SB, I'll be out of position postflop, which makes playing marginal hands like this much harder.\n\nGiven that:\n- A8o is a marginal hand at best\n- I'm out of position \n- The opponent has shown preflop raising tendency\n- I need good equity to make this call profitable\n- I have a decent stack that I should preserve\n\n\nI'll confidently fold, recognizing the hand's weakness and the challenging position. The marginal nature of A8o combined with being out of position makes this an easy decision to pass on the opportunity.",

Both cards are low and while they're suited, the gap is too large for this to be a playable hand from early position.\n\n**Position**: UTG (Under The Gun) - This is the worst position at the table. I have to act first preflop and will be out of position for the entire hand. I should only play premium hands from this position.\n\n**Stack**: 200 chips (100 BB) - This is a healthy stack size.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 2 chips to win 3 chips (1.5:1). This is not relevant since my hand is so weak.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: From the limited data:\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB) raised preflop in Hand #1 and continuation bet on the flop\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB) and Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) both called preflop in Hand #1 but folded to the flop bet\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. 3-6 suited is a trash hand from UTG. I should:\n1. Fold this hand 100% of the time from UTG\n2. Preserve my chips for better spots\n3. Avoid playing out of position with weak holdings\n\nThe suitedness doesn't make up for how weak this hand is. Even if I flop a flush draw, it would be a low flush draw that could easily be dominated. And flopping two pair or trips is very unlikely.",

The pot is 38 chips. I have position on the flop (acted last preflop, so will act first postflop).\n\n**Flop analysis:** 8s 2c 3c - This is a very dry board. No overcards to my tens. There's a flush draw with two clubs. My pair of tens is likely the best hand right now. Possible hands for opponent: pocket pairs below TT, suited connectors, broadway cards, maybe A8, A2, A3 type hands.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** From the limited data (only 3 actions), Kimi-K2 called preflop in hand 1, then checked and folded on flop. No raise history seen. This is only the second hand of the tournament, so limited reads.\n\n**My position:** I have position advantage (will act last on future streets).\n\n**Stack sizes:** Both have 178 chips (89 BB). This is deep stacked play.\n\n**Decision:** I need to decide whether to check or bet. With an overpair on a dry board, I should bet for value. Checking could allow opponent to catch up or bluff. The board has some draws (flush draw, straight draws with 4-5, 5-6). A bet of around half to 2/3 pot seems reasonable.\n\nI'll bet for value and protection. Let's say 20 chips (about 2/3 pot).

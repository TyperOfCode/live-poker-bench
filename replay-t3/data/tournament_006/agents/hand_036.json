Opponent GPT-OSS-120B shows straightforward tendencies with frequent folds to pressure. Pot odds are favorable (calling 12 to win 30), and I have ~45-50% equity against their range. Calling keeps the pot manageable while leveraging my positional advantage postflop.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: Ts Qh - Queen-Ten offsuit. This is a decent but not premium hand. It has good playability but can be dominated.\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - This is excellent position, the best at the table.\n\n**Stack**: 248 chips (62 BB) - Healthy stack size.\n\n**Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 12 chips (3x BB). I need to call 12.\n\nLet me analyze the opponent's tendencies based on the data I just retrieved:\n\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's 20 most recent actions:\n- They raise to 12 chips frequently (hands 25, 27)\n- They sometimes call preflop (hands 27, 30, 35)\n- They fold a lot when faced with pressure (hand 26 preflop, 27 postflop, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34)\n- They seem to play somewhat passively postflop (checking often in hands 27, 28, 30)\n- They do occasionally bet postflop (hand 35 turn)\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is playing fairly straightforward and possibly a bit tight/passive. They make standard raises but often give up when facing resistance.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 12 to win 18 (4 from blinds + 12 from raise + 2 from SB). That's 12/30 = 40% of the pot, which means I need ~30% equity to call (since there's still money behind).\n\n**Hand equity**: QTo on the button vs a standard opening range (say 15-20% of hands) has roughly 45-50% equity. So from a pure equity standpoint, this is a clear call.\n\n**Position advantage**: Being on the button means I'll act last on all postflop streets, which is a huge advantage with a speculative hand like QTo.\n\n**Stack considerations**: I'm not committed yet. Calling 12 from 248 leaves me with 236 chips. \n\nLet me consider my options:\n\n1. **Fold**: Too tight. I have a playable hand in great position with good pot odds.\n\n2. **Call**: Standard play. I have position, decent hand, good pot odds, and my opponent seems straightforward. I can see a flop and evaluate.\n\n3. **Raise**: Could be considered as a squeeze/re-steal. However, given the opponent's tendency to fold to pressure, a raise might get them to fold hands we're ahead of, and we'd risk 20+ chips. Also, we don't have great information about how they respond to 3-bets.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have position\n- I have a playable hand with good equity\n- Pot odds are good\n- Opponent seems straightforward and may fold to pressure postflop\n- My hand plays well postflop in position\n\nI think calling is the best option. Raising is too aggressive with QTo, and folding is too tight. I want to see a flop in position and outplay my opponent postflop.\n\nLet me make the call.",

With Q-high on a K-high board with possible flush/straight draws, I have no showdown value and would be bluffing. Opponent is passive but called flop, suggesting some connection. Checking preserves stack and sees river for free where I might improve to a winning Q.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  The opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been quite passive, folding frequently preflop and checking/calling when involved. In hand 30, they showed down 9h Jc, indicating they might play some speculative hands. In hand 35, they called on the flop then folded on the turn after checking.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I have Qh Ts on a board of 4d 2d 4h Kd\n- Pot is 80 chips\n- I have 216 chips (54 BB)\n- Board shows a possible flush draw (3 diamonds), and I have the Ts (not a diamond)\n- I have top pair with Q on a K-high board - I'm losing to any K\n- Opponent checked to me\n\nLet me analyze this:\n1. Hand strength: I have Q-high, which is not great on a K-high board. Any K beats me. The board is paired (4s), so there are possible full houses. The 3 diamonds mean possible flushes.\n2. Position: I'm on the button, which is good\n3. Opponent: Based on the history, Kimi-K2 is passive and folds frequently. They called on the flop after I bet, suggesting they might have something but not strong enough to bet themselves.\n4. Pot odds: The pot is 80, and I can check for free or bet\n5. Tournament: We're still relatively deep at 54 BB\n\nThe opponent called my flop bet of 20 into a pot of 28 (preflop 12+12+4=28), so they called 20 into 48, which is about 42% pot odds. They could have:\n- A flush draw (any diamond)\n- A K with weak kicker\n- A pocket pair\n- A 4 (trip 4s)\n- Straight draw (A3, 35)\n\nNow the Kd came on the turn, which is a scare card. If they had a flush draw, they just hit it. If they had a K, they now have top pair. But they checked to me.\n\nGiven their passive nature and the check on the turn, I should probably check behind. Betting would be a bluff since I have no showdown value against a K or any pair. Checking allows me to see the river for free and hope to improve to a Q that might win if they have nothing.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I have Q-high. That's very weak on this board. The opponent called the flop bet, which could mean:\n1. They have a hand they're continuing with\n2. They have a draw\n3. They're floating with air\n\nGiven that they checked the turn, if I bet now, I might get them to fold some weaker hands. But what am I trying to accomplish? I have no real equity here. I should probably just check and give up unless I improve.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The opponent is passive. They called flop, checked turn.

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Board: 4d 2d 4h Kd 8d (four diamonds on board, including Kd and 8d on river)\n- My hand: Ts Qh (no pair, no flush, just ten-high)\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- I'm on the button\n- Only opponent left: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)\n- Action: Seat 2 checked to me\n\n**Board analysis:**\n- Four diamonds on board: 4d, 2d, Kd, 8d\n- Any opponent with any diamond has a flush\n- The board is paired (4s), but only once\n- I have no showdown value with Ts Qh\n\n**Opponent analysis from memory:**\nLooking at the opponent actions, Seat 2 has been:\n- Folding a lot preflop (many folds)\n- When they do play, they check-call on the flop in hand #35\n- In hand #30, they showed down 9h Jc on a board with 4 spades (Ks 2s 8s 6s 8c) - they called down with just a jack-high\n\nThis suggests Seat 2 is a calling station who will call with weak hands, even on dangerous boards.\n\n**Action in this hand:**\n- Preflop: Called my 12 chip raise\n- Flop (4d 2d 4h): Checked, I bet 20, they called\n- Turn (Kd): Checked to me, I checked\n- River (8d): They checked to me\n\nThe turn check from me was likely weak, and now they checked again. They called the flop bet on a paired board with two diamonds, so they could have:\n- A weak made hand (pair, two pair)\n- A flush draw that just got there\n- A straight draw\n- Air\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check: Showdown with ten-high, which likely loses\n2. Bet as a bluff: Try to get them to fold better hands\n\nGiven that this opponent seems to call with weak hands (like J9 on a 4-flush board in hand #30), bluffing is dangerous. However, the four diamonds on board is very scary. \n\nBut wait - let me reconsider. The opponent called on the flop when there were just two diamonds. They might have had:\n- A weak pair\n- A draw\n- Some random hand\n\nNow with four diamonds, if they don't have a diamond, they likely can't call a bet. But based on their showdown in hand #30, they called with J-high on a 4-flush board. That suggests they're not easily scared.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI have zero showdown value. Betting would be pure bluff. Given the opponent's tendency to call with weak hands (as shown in hand #30), this is not a good bluffing spot. I should check and give up.\n\nThe opponent's check could mean weakness, but it could also mean they have a weak made hand or a flush and are trying to induce a bluff. Given their calling station tendencies, I don't want to bluff.\n\nI'll check and likely lose, but preserve my chips for better spots.",

There are also two diamonds, so flush draws are possible.\n2. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) appears to be fairly active, with a mix of folds, calls, and raises. They made a flop bet in hand 35 and showed down Js-3c in hand 4, suggesting they play a wide range.\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been fairly passive, checking often and only making small bets.\n3. **Position**: I'm out of position but the action suggests I might have some fold equity.\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 134 chips left, so I have room to play but need to be careful.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- I have ace-high with a jack kicker\n- The paired board reduces the value of my hand\n- I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (60:20) to call\n- Seat 1's bet could be a continuation bet or they could have connected with this board\n- My ace-high might be good here, but it's not a strong holding\n\nGiven the paired board and my ace-high hand, I think calling is the best play. Raising would be too aggressive here without a stronger hand or draw.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Calling with ace-high on paired board.

If they bet big again, I likely need to fold given my stack size and the coordinated board.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Dangerous board with possible flush and full house draws.

Here's why:\n1. My hand has showdown value - ace-high beats many possible holdings\n2. The board is extremely scary (four-flush and paired board)\n3. My opponent likely either has a flush (and would call/shove over a bet) or has nothing and would fold to any bet\n4. I can't get value from worse hands, and better hands won't fold\n5. Checking preserves my tournament life and chips\n\nThe opponent's check indicates they either have a marginal hand they're unsure about or complete air. Since I can't beat any reasonable value hand they might call with, the best play is to check and go to showdown.\n\n{\"action\": \"check\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"Board is too scary with four diamonds - checking preserves showdown value with ace-high against opponent who likely either has flush or nothing\"}",

The pot is 40 chips, and I need to call 8 chips. That's pot odds of 8 to win 48 (40+8), or 1:6, meaning I need about 14.3% equity to call.\n\nLet's think about the opponents:\n1. GPT-OSS-120B raised to 12 (3x BB) from the cutoff. Looking at their history, they've been raising preflop frequently (6 times in 35 hands). They seem somewhat aggressive.\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking called from UTG+1. They have called twice preflop in history.\n3. Kimi-K2 (SB) called completing from SB.\n\nSo there are already 3 players in the pot. With 32s suited, my hand has some speculative value - can make straights, flushes, and occasionally two pair. But it's very weak and easily dominated.\n\nMy stack is 194 chips (48.5 BB), which is healthy but not huge. The raise was to 12 (3x BB), and I need to call 8 more. If I call, the pot will be 48, and I'll have 186 left.\n\nGiven the multi-way action, implied odds could be decent if I hit a strong hand. But 32s is the absolute bottom of suited connectors. The problem is that even if I hit a pair, it's likely to be dominated. A flush with 32s is the \"nut low\" flush, which can be dangerous if someone has a higher flush.\n\nLet me check if I've played similar hands before. Looking at my history, I've folded most marginal hands. I did play 54s from SB in hand #32 and checked it down but folded on river.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I have a decent stack, but not huge. I should be selective. The pot odds are good (1:6), but my hand is extremely weak. Even with implied odds, I'm out of position (BB), which makes playing postflop difficult.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. 32s is just too weak, even suited. The fact that there's already a raiser and two callers means someone likely has a decent hand. I'd be hoping for a miracle flop, and even then, I could get stacked if I hit a low flush or straight and someone has a better one.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack for better spots."

The pot is 40 chips, and I need to call 8 chips. That's pot odds of 8 to win 48 (40+8), or 1:6, meaning I need about 14.3% equity to call.\n\nLet's think about the opponents:\n1. GPT-OSS-120B raised to 12 (3x BB) from the cutoff. Looking at their history, they've been raising preflop frequently (6 times in 35 hands). They seem somewhat aggressive.\n2. Kimi-K2 Thinking called from UTG+1. They have called twice preflop in history.\n3. Kimi-K2 (SB) called completing from SB.\n\nSo there are already 3 players in the pot. With 32s suited, my hand has some speculative value - can make straights, flushes, and occasionally two pair. But it's very weak and easily dominated.\n\nMy stack is 194 chips (48.5 BB), which is healthy but not huge. The raise was to 12 (3x BB), and I need to call 8 more. If I call, the pot will be 48, and I'll have 186 left.\n\nGiven the multi-way action, implied odds could be decent if I hit a strong hand. But 32s is the absolute bottom of suited connectors. The problem is that even if I hit a pair, it's likely to be dominated. A flush with 32s is the \"nut low\" flush, which can be dangerous if someone has a higher flush.\n\nLet me check if I've played similar hands before. Looking at my history, I've folded most marginal hands. I did play 54s from SB in hand #32 and checked it down but folded on river.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I have a decent stack, but not huge. I should be selective. The pot odds are good (1:6), but my hand is extremely weak. Even with implied odds, I'm out of position (BB), which makes playing postflop difficult.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. 32s is just too weak, even suited. The fact that there's already a raiser and two callers means someone likely has a decent hand. I'd be hoping for a miracle flop, and even then, I could get stacked if I hit a low flush or straight and someone has a better one.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack for better spots.",

Pot odds are 1:6, or 14.3% equity needed.\n\n32s suited has some speculative value but is very weak. Multi-way pot, out of position. Even if I flop a flush draw, it's a low flush. Pair of 3s or 2s is weak. I could flop a straight draw, but 32s needs 4,5 or A,4,5 for open-ender.\n\nGiven the tournament context and my stack (48.5 BB), folding seems correct.

So UTG acts next. Amount to call is 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: seat2 (Kimi-K2) raises preflop sometimes; from recall, they raised amounts 6, 12, 20. They are somewhat aggressive, maybe raise with a wide range? Not sure. Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) posted BB, unknown.\n\nOur hand T\u2665 Q\u2666 is suited? No, hearts vs diamonds, not suited. So it's offsuit.\n\nIn UTG, Q T offsuit is marginal. In deep stacks, you could consider a raise to isolate, but many players would 3-bet with stronger. With 48 BB, you could open raise to 12-16 BB? Actually typical raise is 2.5-3 BB, so 8-12 chips. Minimum raise is 8, which is 2 BB (since big blind is 4). That's a small raise, but could be used as a \"limp\" call? Actually calling 4 chips is a limp. That would be a limp with Q T offsuit UTG, which is not advisable.\n\nBetter to raise to 12 (3 BB) to thin the field. But we need to see if we have raise action legal? Yes.\n\nGiven opponent tendencies: seat2 sometimes raises preflop, but they are after us? Actually seat2 is SB, after us.

Seat3 (BB) may also call or 3-bet.\n\nGiven tournament stage unknown, but we have decent stack.\n\nThus I think raise to 12 (total) is appropriate.\n\nReasoning: hand is decent but not premium, UTG position, want to thin field, avoid limping.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

Also we have overcards Q and T. Opponent(s) on flop: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) checked. Seat 1 called preflop and is still in? Actually seat 1 called preflop, but we have only seat 2's action listed; maybe seat 1 is also in but hasn't acted yet? The flop actions list only Seat 2 check. Probably seat 1 is next to act, but not listed? The legal actions are for us (BB). The pot is 40 chips. Our stack 183. We are first to act? Actually seat order: after flop, action starts with UTG? The flop order is from left of button? In BB, after flop, the first to act is UTG (Seat 1 maybe). But seat 2 checked, maybe seat 1 already acted? Actually seat 2 is Kimi-K2, seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (maybe same player). The seat numbers: seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking - 236 chips (maybe the player is thinking). seat2 is Kimi-K2 - 134 chips. So seat1 is the one who called preflop (call 12). seat2 is SB who posted 2 and called preflop. So flop order: first to act is seat1 (UTG?), then seat2, then us (BB). But seat2 check is listed, meaning seat1 must have acted before seat2. But not shown. Possibly seat1 checked as well, but not listed. The legal actions for us: fold, check, raise. So we can check or raise.\n\nOur hand: Th Qd. Board: 4d 2d 4h. We have backdoor flush draw (needs two more diamonds). Also we have gutshot? Not really. Pair of 4s on board; we have no pair. Potential for overpair? No. So hand is weak. However opponent may have a hand like 44 (full house), or a set of 2? Actually board has pair of 4s; possible opponent could have 4x for set, or a 2 for trips? Actually only one 2 on board, so 2x would be two pair? If opponent holds 2? they'd have two pair (2s and 4s). Or could have flush draw with diamonds. Could have straight draws? Board 4-2-4, not many.\n\nOur best line likely is to check and see a turn, maybe try a small raise if we think opponent is weak? But we have only backdoor draws; not strong enough to raise. Checking is safe.\n\nConsider stack sizes: opponent seat2 has 134 chips, seat1 has 236. Our stack 183. Pot 40. If we check and opponent bets later, we can decide.\n\nThus choose check.\n\nWe must output JSON with action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

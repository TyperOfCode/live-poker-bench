            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: SB (Seat 1) - small blind\n- Hand: Kc 2c (King of clubs, 2 of clubs)\n- Stack: 220 chips (55 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 18 chips (2 from SB + 4 from BB + 12 from raise)\n- Amount to call: 10 (the raise is 12, I've already posted 2)\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise to 20+\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nK2s (suited) is a very marginal hand. It's a \"trouble hand\" because:\n- Dominated by any other king (KX where X > 2)\n- Weak kicker\n- Only suited connector potential is very limited (need both a 3 and an ace for a straight)\n- Flush potential is there but low\n\n**Position:** \nI'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions. I'll be out of position post-flop.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent history:\n- Very tight player (folded preflop in hands 13, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24)\n- When they do raise (hands 15, 20), they often fold on later streets\n- They seem to be playing a tight-aggressive style but giving up easily\n\nTheir raise to 12 (3x BB) from CO position suggests they have a real hand, not just a steal attempt. Given their tight nature, this is likely a strong range (pairs, broadway cards, strong aces, etc.).\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- To call: 10 chips to win 18 chips = 1.8:1 or ~35.7% equity needed\n- K2s typically has around 30-35% equity against a standard raising range\n- The pot odds are marginal at best\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (55 BB)\n- This is not a spot to risk chips with a marginal hand\n- Better to preserve my stack for better opportunities\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEven though the opponent appears tight and might be raising light, K2s is just too weak to defend from the SB. The hand is dominated too often, I'll be out of position, and the pot odds don't justify the call. This is a clear fold.\n\n**Decision:** Fold",

Looking at my position - UTG is the worst position to play from, as I have to act first preflop and will be out of position postflop against all other players.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been folding a lot preflop (8/10 times), only called once from SB and then bet small on flop.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has also been folding frequently preflop (7/10 times), raised once from late position.\n\nFrom my hand history, I see that in hand #15 I had 3s 9s from UTG and folded, which is similar to this hand. In hand #20 I had 9s Js from UTG and folded. So I've been folding weak hands from UTG previously.\n\nMy stack is 212 chips (53 BB), which is healthy. The blinds are 2/4, so 4 chips to call. That's 1.9% of my stack. However, 9h 3d offsuit is one of the worst possible hands - it's not suited, has low cards with a gap, and has almost no potential to make strong hands.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy: I should be tight from UTG, especially with such a weak hand. The risk of being raised behind me is high, and even if I call and see a flop, I'll be out of position with a weak hand that rarely connects well.\n\nPot odds: 4 to call into 6 pot (after my call would be 10). That's 1:1.5 odds, but I need much better implied odds with such a weak hand.\n\nGiven all factors:\n- Terrible hand (9h 3o)\n- Worst position (UTG)\n- Opponents behind could raise\n- Low probability of hitting a flop that helps\n- Even if I hit a pair, it's vulnerable to overcards\n\nThe correct play is to fold. This hand has negative expected value from UTG. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9h 3d is extremely weak from UTG position.

I've folded 18 out of 24 total hands, with only a 20.8% win rate. This is actually quite typical for a tight player in early tournament stages. I notice I've been folding a lot of marginal hands from various positions, including UTG (hand #16 and #21) where I folded 3c Kd and 5c 6d respectively.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been active but mostly folding preflop. I see they made a raise to 12 chips in hand #21, and in one showdown they had Js 3c. This suggests they can have a wide range but are capable of raising.\n\n**Current Hand**: I have 8d Js - a suited connector. From UTG position, this is definitely a fold. UTG is the worst position and requires premium hands. Even though I have some positional awareness from my history, 8Js is too weak to play from UTG, especially with 3 players still to act behind me.\n\nThe combination of:\n- Weak hand (8Js)\n- Worst position (UTG) \n- Multiple players left to act\n- My conservative/tight playing style\n- No compelling reason to deviate from my strategy\n\nAll point to a clear fold decision.\n",

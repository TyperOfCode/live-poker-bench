Only raised once in hand 43. Seems to be playing very few hands.\n- Seat 3 (BB): Relatively active, has folded a lot recently but did raise in hand 48. In hand 43, they called a raise and then bet on flop and turn.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n2h 9c is a terrible hand:\n- Not suited\n- No connectivity (gap of 6 ranks)\n- Low card values\n- Very low playability post-flop\n\n**Position analysis:**\nEven though I'm on the button (best position), this hand is simply too weak to play. The only consideration might be to try to steal the blinds if the opponents are very tight.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n- SB has been extremely tight, folding 7 hands in a row. They might fold to a steal attempt.\n- BB has been more active but still folds frequently. They did defend once with a raise in hand 48.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 21.6 BB, which is a decent stack. I don't need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands.\n\n**Decision:**\nEven though I have position and the opponents seem tight, 2h 9c is just too weak to play. The hand has almost no post-flop potential. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nIf I were to raise as a steal:\n- Minimum raise would be to 16 (2x BB)\n- Risking 16 chips to win 12\n- Need both to fold ~57% of the time to break even\n- Given SB's tightness, they might fold often, but BB has shown willingness to defend\n\nBut with such a weak hand, it's better to preserve chips and fold. The risk/reward isn't worth it with 2h 9c.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2h 9c is an extremely weak, unsuited, disconnected low hand with no playability.

They checked all streets to the river, showing weakness.\n\n4. **Betting pattern**: My opponent has checked every street (flop, turn, and now river), showing significant weakness. This suggests they likely have:\n   - A weak King (but why check the flop when I checked?)\n   - A small pocket pair (22-33, 55-QQ)\n   - Missed straight draws or weak aces\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is 16 chips and I have a marginal hand. The key question is whether I can get my opponent to fold better hands.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 220 chips (27.5 BB), I need to accumulate chips but can't be reckless.\n\nGiven that my opponent has shown weakness by checking all streets, this is a good spot for a small river bluff to try to get them off their likely weak holding. My pocket sixes might even be good here, but a small bet could get hands like pocket 2s-3s, 5s-QQ to fold.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 16,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Opponent has shown weakness checking all streets.

The SB (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) just completed the small blind by calling 4 more chips (they already posted 4 as SB, so they put in 4 more to match the BB of 8). \n\nThe pot is 16 chips (8 from my BB, 4 from their SB, 4 from their call). I have position advantage as I'll act last postflop.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been folding a lot recently - they've folded preflop in the last 8 hands straight (hands 43-50). They only completed the SB this time, which suggests they might have a marginal hand or just defending their blind.\n\nMy hand (9d 5c) is terrible - offsuit, no connectors, low cards. It's a clear fold in most situations. However, I'm already in for 8 chips as the BB, and the pot is 16. If I check, I get to see a flop for free with position.\n\nStack sizes: I have 276 chips (34.5 BB), opponent has 220 chips (27.5 BB). I have a chip lead.\n\nTournament considerations: I should preserve my stack and avoid playing marginal hands out of position, but here I have position advantage postflop.\n\nPot odds: It costs me 0 to check and see a flop. That's infinite pot odds. Even with a terrible hand, seeing a free flop with position has some value.\n\nBut the downside: Playing 9-5 offsuit can get me into trouble if I hit a piece of the flop. This hand has very little potential - it's not suited, not connected, low cards. The best case is hitting two pair or trips, which is unlikely.\n\nGiven that:\n1. My hand is very weak\n2. I have position advantage\n3. It's free to see the flop\n4. Opponent has been folding a lot recently\n5. I should avoid spewing chips with trash hands\n\nI think the best play is to check and see a free flop. If the flop completely misses me (which is likely), I can check-fold. If I hit something unexpectedly strong, I can play accordingly. But raising with this hand would be terrible - I'd be putting more money in with a weak hand.\n\nLet me check if there's any additional information about opponent tendencies when they complete from SB. Looking at the opponent actions: in hand 37 they called 12 preflop (likely from BB or SB), then raised 80 on flop. In hand 40 they called 12 preflop then bet 24 on flop. So they do sometimes play postflop aggressively.\n\nGiven all this, I'll check.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm in the BB with 9d 5c. The flop is Kd 4s 5h. I have bottom pair with 5s. The board has a King high, which is a scary card. My opponent in Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) checked to me.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Seat 2 has been folding a lot recently (folded 7 hands in a row preflop). In hand #43, they raised preflop to 24, then checked and folded on the flop. They seem cautious. They also had showdowns with weak hands (9h Jc and Jh Ac).\n\nMy hand: Bottom pair with 5s, weak kicker 9. The board is Kd 4s 5h - I have bottom pair, no flush draws, weak hand overall. However, I'm in position (they checked to me), and the pot is small (16 chips).\n\nGiven that opponent checked, they likely don't have a strong hand. A King would probably bet for protection. They might have missed the flop or have a weak hand.\n\nOptions:\n1. Check: Take a free card, see turn. Safe play with weak hand.\n2. Bet: Could try to take the pot down now with a small bet. Risk is they call or raise, and I'm likely behind.\n\nMy stack: 276 chips (34.5 BB) - healthy stack. Opponent: 220 chips.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 16, to bet minimum 8 would be 1:2 odds, but I'd be betting to win 16 with 8 risk.\n\nGiven my weak hand and the fact I'm only beating pure bluffs, checking seems best. I can reevaluate on turn. If opponent bets turn, I can fold. If check-check, I might get a free river.\n\nAlso tournament considerations: I have a decent stack, no need to risk chips with marginal hands. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nDecision: Check.",

Heads-up situation.\n\n**Betting action so far:**\n- Preflop: SB (opponent) posted 4, I posted 8, opponent called 4 more, I checked\n- Flop: Both checked\n- Turn: Opponent checked\n\n**Opponent tendencies from recall:**\n- Seat 2 has been folding a lot recently (folded 7 of last 8 hands preflop)\n- Only one recent raise was in hand #43 (preflop raise to 24)\n- Showdown hands: had 9h Jc and Jh Ac in earlier hands\n- Seems somewhat tight/passive based on recent folding\n\n**Hand strength:** I have middle pair (5s) on a paired board (4s). This is a weak hand. The board is Kd 4s 5h 4c. There's a possible flush draw (diamonds) and straight draws (3-6, 6-7). My hand is vulnerable - any K, 4, or higher pair beats me. The 5 gives me a pair, but it's bottom of the paired board.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 16 chips. If I bet, I could potentially win 16 chips with a bluff or value bet. But my hand has some showdown value.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have a healthy stack (34.5 BB), opponent has 27.5 BB. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Decision:** \n- Opponent checked twice (flop and turn), suggesting weakness\n- My hand has marginal showdown value - middle pair weak kicker\n- I could consider a small bet to try to win the pot now, but this risks getting raised\n- Checking seems reasonable to see a free river and potentially win at showdown if opponent has nothing\n\nGiven the opponent's passive recent behavior and my marginal hand, I think checking is best. If I bet and get called or raised, I'm in a tough spot. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to potentially win at showdown or bluff on the river if I improve.\n\nI'll check.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have 9d 5c, with board: Kd 4s 5h 4c Ac. I have a pair of 5s, with a 9 kicker. The board has two pairs possible (4s and Ks, plus the Ace), but I only have bottom pair with weak kicker.\n\n2. **Opponent action**: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called preflop from SB, checked flop and turn, then bet 16 on river. Looking at their history, they've been fairly tight recently (many preflop folds), but have shown some aggression on flops when they do play (hand 37 raised 80 on flop, hand 40 bet 24 on flop). They showed down Jc Ac in hand 36.\n\n3. **Pot size**: 32 chips, bet is 16 to call. Pot odds: 16 to win 48 (32+16), so I need ~25% equity.\n\n4. **Board analysis**: Kd 4s 5h 4c Ac - This is a dry board. The Ace on river completes potential draws. Opponent could have:\n   - A weak Ace (A-x) that checked flop and turn, then bet river for value\n   - A King (K-x) that checked flop and turn, now betting for thin value\n   - A bluff (missed draws like 6-7, 3-6, or just air)\n   - A 4 (trips) or full house (4-4, 5-5, K-4, A-4)\n\n5. **My hand**: Pair of 5s with 9 kicker. This beats only bluffs and maybe some very weak Ace-high hands. I lose to any Ace, any King, any 4, any pocket pair higher than 5s.\n\n6. **Opponent range**: They called preflop from SB after posting SB. Their range could be wide, but given their tight recent play, maybe not super wide. They checked flop and turn, so likely weak or drawing hand.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: I have 276 chips (34.5 BB), opponent has 204 chips. Not a huge difference. Calling 16 chips is 5.8% of my stack.\n\nGiven the pot odds (25% needed) and my hand strength, I need to estimate my equity. Against a reasonable range of: weak Aces (A2-A9), some Kings, some bluffs, maybe some missed draws... I probably have less than 25% equity. The Ace on river is particularly bad for me as it hits many of their potential calling hands.\n\nAlso, opponent's bet sizing (half pot) is often for value with medium-strength hands. They might think their Ace is good.\n\nHowever, there's a chance they're bluffing after checking twice. But with this dry board, what bluffs do they have? Maybe 6-7, 3-6 type hands that missed.\n\nGiven all this, I think folding is correct. My hand is too weak, the river Ace is bad, and I'm likely beat.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the fact that I'm in BB and checked preflop. They might think I have a weak range too and could be bluffing. But still, my hand is just bottom pair weak kicker.\n\nActually, let me check if there are any straight draws that missed. Board: Kd 4s 5h 4c Ac. Possible draws: 6-7 (open-ended to 8-3, but 3 and 8 needed), 2-3 (gutshot to 5), 3-6 (gutshot to 7). Not many natural draws.\n\nI think fold is correct.",

Q6 suited is far too weak to play from UTG, especially with multiple opponents left to act. The hand has poor playability and minimal equity. I need to preserve my stack for a much stronger hand that can generate more chips in better position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q6 suited is too weak to play from UTG position with multiple opponents left to act. Need to preserve 22 BB stack for a stronger hand with better playability and equity.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Cards: 6c Qc (queen and six of clubs)\n- Position: UTG (Under the Gun) - very early position\n- Stack: 176 chips (22.0 BB)\n- Amount to call: 8 chips\n- Minimum raise to: 16 chips\n\n**Position Considerations:**\nBeing UTG is the worst position in poker. I have to act first preflop with no information about what other players will do. This significantly reduces the value of marginal hands.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nQ6 suited is a very weak hand, especially in early position. It has very little straight potential and only 4 possible flush combinations. The queen is high, but the 6 is very low, making this a poor connector.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the memory recall:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Recent history shows mostly folds preflop, but did raise to 24 chips in hand #43. This suggests they might be tight-passive or only raising with strong hands.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): More active, called a raise in hand #43, then bet aggressively on flop and turn. Also raised to 20 chips in hand #48. This suggests a more aggressive player.\n\n**My UTG History:**\nLooking at my UTG hands, I have a 24% win rate (12 wins out of 50 hands), which is reasonable. Most of my UTG hands have been folded (37 out of 50), indicating I've been playing tight from this position, which is correct.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- 22 BB stack is medium-deep\n- Need to preserve chips for better spots\n- Q6 suited is not strong enough to play from UTG\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. Q6 suited is too weak to play from UTG, especially with 3 opponents left to act behind me. The hand has very little potential and would require me to invest 8 chips to see a flop with poor equity. \n\nGiven the position disadvantage and weak hand strength, folding preserves my stack for a much better opportunity.\n",

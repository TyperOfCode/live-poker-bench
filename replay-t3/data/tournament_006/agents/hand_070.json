Better to preserve my stack and wait for a stronger hand or better situation to commit my chips.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My hand: 6\u2660 A\u2666 (Ace-6 offsuit)\n- Position: Button (good position)\n- My stack: 220 chips (13.8 BB) - getting short\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- To call: 48 chips\n- Minimum raise: 96 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised to 56 - they have 0 chips now (out)\n- Seats 4 and 5 folded\n\nWait, the opponent data shows DeepSeek-V3.2 raised in hand #61 with 56 chips, and hand #61 shows I was in BTN with 2s Qh and folded. Let me check the current hand again.\n\nActually, looking at the hand history, it says \"Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 0 chips (out)\" but the actions show they raised to 56. This seems contradictory. Let me assume they're still in and raised to 56.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the recall data, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been very active with preflop raises:\n- Multiple raises varying from 6 to 177 chips\n- Showdowns show they played A6 (which I have now) and KK\n- They seem aggressive preflop\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- A6 offsuit is a marginal hand, especially with a low kicker\n- On the button, I have position advantage\n- My stack is 13.8 BB - this is a critical decision point\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- To call: 48 chips\n- Pot odds: 80:48 or 1.67:1\n- This means I need ~37.5% equity to call\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- With 13.8 BB, I'm in the danger zone\n- I need to be thinking about preserving my stack or finding good spots to accumulate\n- A6 offsuit is not a premium hand, but it's not terrible either\n- The opponent is aggressive, which could mean they're raising wide\n\n**Options:**\n1. Fold - Safest, preserves my 220 stack\n2. Call 48 - Pot is 80, I'd be calling 48 more. After call, pot would be 128, I'd have 172 left (10.75 BB)\n3. Raise to 96 (minimum) or more - This would commit me significantly\n\nGiven my stack size and the marginal nature of A6 offsuit, I think this is a fold. The opponent's aggression suggests they could have a better Ace or any pocket pair. With only 13.8 BB, I should be more selective and wait for a better spot or a premium hand to shove with.\n\nHowever, I am on the button, and if the opponent is raising wide, A6 might be ahead of their range. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, with 13.8 BB, I should be looking for spots to either fold or go all-in. A min-raise to 96 would leave me with 124 chips (7.75 BB), which is very awkward. If I call 48, I have 172 left.\n\nI think the best play here is to **fold**. A6 offsuit is too weak to commit chips with when I'm this short, and I should wait for a better opportunity to get my money in good.",

My stack is only 56 chips (3.5 BB), which is critically short. This is essentially a push-or-fold situation.\n\nLet me think about the tournament dynamics:\n- I have 3.5 BB, which is extremely short-stacked\n- Blinds are 8/16\n- I'm UTG, so there are 4 players left to act after me\n- My hand KdJd is suited, which adds some value\n- With such a short stack, I need to find a spot to double up soon\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 1 (SB) has shown aggressive preflop raising tendencies\n- Seat 2 (BB) has also been aggressive\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised preflop several times\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been quite aggressive with preflop raises\n\nGiven my stack size of 3.5 BB, I should be looking to go all-in with a wide range. KJs is actually a decent hand for this situation. The key considerations:\n\n1. If I fold, I'll have 56 chips left (3.5 BB) and will be in the BB next hand (posting 16), leaving me with 40 chips (2.5 BB) after posting.\n\n2. If I call (16 chips), I'll have 40 chips left and will likely face raises from aggressive players behind me.\n\n3. If I raise all-in (56 chips), I put maximum pressure on opponents.\n\nWith KJs suited, this is a hand worth going all-in with from UTG when this short. It has good equity against many calling ranges. The suited aspect gives it additional flush potential.\n\nPot odds: Currently pot is 24 (SB 8 + BB 16). If I go all-in for 56, I'm risking 56 to win 24 + whatever calls. If one caller, I'm getting roughly 1:1 odds.\n\nGiven my desperate stack situation and the quality of KJs suited, going all-in is the best play. Waiting for a better spot is risky as I'll be forced all-in soon anyway.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations from my hand history.",

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I have Jd Kd in UTG with only 56 chips (3.5 BB). This is a very short stack situation. I'm first to act preflop. The blinds are 8/16. I need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise.\n\nLooking at my hand: KJs suited is a decent hand, but from UTG it's not premium. With only 3.5 BB, I'm essentially in push-or-fold territory. I should consider going all-in or folding.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see some patterns:\n- Hand #61: I had AsTs in BB and raised all-in (56 chips) when facing a call from Kimi-K2, and they folded.\n- Hand #64: I had Ad9d and raised all-in (169 chips) from CO and everyone folded.\n- Hand #66: I had 6cAc and went all-in preflop (177 chips) against Kimi-K2 who called with QQ and won.\n- Hand #68: I had 6s7h and raised to 32 from BTN and everyone folded.\n\nSo I've been aggressive with short stacks before. With KJs suited, it's actually one of the better hands to shove with from UTG when short-stacked.\n\nLet me think about the math: I have 56 chips. If I call 16, I'll have 40 left (2.5 BB). That's committing 28.6% of my stack preflop, which is too much to call and then fold later. So it's either fold or go all-in.\n\nPot odds: If I shove for 56, the pot would be 24 (current) + 56 (my shove) = 80. Anyone calling would need to call 40 more (since BB already has 16 in). That's 2:1 pot odds, which many hands might call with.\n\nBut my stack is so short that I need to take a stand soon. KJs suited has good equity against random hands.\n\nLet me check opponent tendencies. Looking at the search results:\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2) has been aggressive preflop with raises (hand 62, 66, 67)\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1) seems more passive\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) and GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) are in later positions\n\nWith 5 players left to act after me, there's risk of being called. But with only 3.5 BB, I should probably shove with KJs.\n\nActually, let me think about ICM considerations. I'm the shortest stack at the table. If I fold, I'll have 56 chips (3.5 BB) and be in the BB next hand (seat 4 is SB, seat 5 is BB). Actually wait, positions: I'm UTG (seat 3), seat 4 is MP, seat 5 is CO, seat 1 is BTN, seat 2 is SB? No, seat 1 posted SB, seat 2 posted BB. So seat 1 is SB, seat 2 is BB. Next hand I'll be in MP? Actually the blinds rotate.\n\nAnyway, with 3.5 BB, I'm in critical condition. I need to double up soon. KJs is a good hand to shove with.\n\nLet me check what hands I've shoved with before from similar positions. From the history:\n- Hand #61: Shoved ATo from BB (good hand)\n- Hand #64: Shoved A9s from CO (decent)\n- Hand #66: Shoved A6o from BB (weaker)\n\nKJs is better than A6o and similar to A9s in equity.\n\nI should go all-in. The reasoning: With only 3.5 BB, I need to take a stand with a decent hand. KJs suited has good equity against random hands and plays well postflop if called. Folding leaves me with no fold equity next hand. Going all-in gives me fold equity and a chance to pick up the blinds.\n\nLet me structure my response.",

Calling 56 chips represents 62% of my stack, which is a significant commitment for such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Position**: While I'm in a decent position (cut-off), K2 offsuit doesn't benefit much from position.\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis**: The raiser (Seat 3) has shown a tendency to raise preflop and has had some strong hands at showdown recently, suggesting they may have a solid opening range.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: Although I'm getting 3.5:1 pot odds (80:23), K2 offsuit likely has very poor equity against a raiser's range and offers little postflop playability.\n\nIn this spot, I should fold and wait for a better opportunity.

They've also shown some decent hands when they got to showdown - they had AK and KK in recent hands.\n\nHowever, this doesn't change my decision. With K2 offsuit, I have a very weak hand that has poor equity against a raiser's range. Even if the opponent is aggressive, K2 offsuit is just too weak to continue with, especially when:\n\n1. I'm getting 3.5:1 pot odds (80:23), but K2 offsuit likely has very poor equity against an opening range\n2. I'm in the cut-off position with a short stack (90 chips = 5.6 BB)\n3. The raise to 56 chips represents a significant portion of my stack (62% of my chips)\n4. Even if I call, I have very little postflop playability with K2\n\nThis is a clear fold.

If they have 0 chips, they'd be out, so no action. However they raised 56, meaning they are the raiser. Our position is BTN, we face a raise of 56 (3.5 BB). Our hand is 7h2h, worst possible.

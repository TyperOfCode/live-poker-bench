There are no completed straights or flushes. The only draws are:\n- 3-4 or 4-5 for a straight\n- Any two spades for a flush draw\n\nWith pocket aces on this board, I have an overpair - currently the best hand most of the time. \n\nPot odds: 26 to win 78, so 3:1 pot odds. This is an easy call, but I should consider raising for value and protection.\n\nI need to think about:\n1. **Protection**: There are some draws possible (spade flush draw, straight draws). I should charge draws.\n2. **Value**: DeepSeek likely has something decent since they called preflop and bet flop. Could be a pair, two pair, or a draw.\n3. **Stack size**: I have 153 chips. If I raise, I need to think about the sizing.\n\nThe minimum raise is to 52 (26 + 26). I could also go all-in.\n\nLet me think about standard raise sizing. The bet is 26 into 78, so about 1/3 pot. A standard raise would be to about 3x their bet or more, so around 78-104 chips.\n\nGiven my stack is 153, a raise to around 80-90 would:\n- Charge draws appropriately\n- Build the pot with my strong hand\n- Not commit my entire stack yet, leaving room for later streets\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 153 chips and the pot already at 78, if I raise to say 90:\n- Pot becomes 168\n- I have ~63 left\n- This essentially commits me anyway\n\nA better approach might be to either:\n1. Raise smaller (like 60-70) to keep the pot manageable\n2. Go all-in now to maximize fold equity and protect against draws\n\nBut wait - going all-in with aces on this relatively safe board might be overkill. The opponent bet 26, which suggests they have something. If I go all-in, they might fold hands I'm ahead of, like 7x, 6x, 2x, or draws.\n\nLet me think about the opponent's range. They called my 3x raise preflop from the BB. That suggests:\n- Pocket pairs (22-QQ)\n- Some suited connectors\n- Some broadway cards\n- Maybe A-x suited\n\nOn this flop (2c 6s 7s), if they have:\n- A set (222, 666, 777): I'm crushed, but that's unlikely with only one of each card on board\n- Two pair (76, 72, 62): I'm behind, but also unlikely they called preflop with these\n- One pair (7x, 6x, 2x): I'm ahead\n- Overpair (88-QQ): I'm ahead\n- Draws: I'm ahead\n\nSo I'm ahead of most of their range. I should raise for value.\n\nGiven the pot is 78 and I need to call 26, if I raise to around 70-80:\n- I'm building the pot\n- Charging draws\n- Not overcommitting if a scary card comes\n\nLet me go with a raise to 75. That's about 2.9x their bet, which is reasonable.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise again - it's to 52 total. That's only adding 26 more. That seems too small. I should raise more.\n\nLet me think about tournament dynamics. I have 19 BB, which is a decent stack but not huge. I don't want to get into a tricky spot on later streets. With aces, I want to get value now.\n\nA good sizing would be to raise to about 75-85 total. Let me go with 78 to match the pot size, or maybe a bit more.\n\nActually, let me be more aggressive. The board has some draw potential. I should charge them. I'll raise to 80 total.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. If I"

If I raise, I need to think about the sizing.\n\nThe minimum raise is to 52 (26 + 26). I could also go all-in.\n\nLet me think about standard raise sizing. The bet is 26 into 78, so about 1/3 pot. A standard raise would be to about 3x their bet or more, so around 78-104 chips.\n\nGiven my stack is 153, a raise to around 80-90 would:\n- Charge draws appropriately\n- Build the pot with my strong hand\n- Not commit my entire stack yet, leaving room for later streets\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 153 chips and the pot already at 78, if I raise to say 90:\n- Pot becomes 168\n- I have ~63 left\n- This essentially commits me anyway\n\nA better approach might be to either:\n1. Raise smaller (like 60-70) to keep the pot manageable\n2. Go all-in now to maximize fold equity and protect against draws\n\nBut wait - going all-in with aces on this relatively safe board might be overkill. The opponent bet 26, which suggests they have something. If I go all-in, they might fold hands I'm ahead of, like 7x, 6x, 2x, or draws.\n\nLet me think about the opponent's range. They called my 3x raise preflop from the BB. That suggests:\n- Pocket pairs (22-QQ)\n- Some suited connectors\n- Some broadway cards\n- Maybe A-x suited\n\nOn this flop (2c 6s 7s), if they have:\n- A set (222, 666, 777): I'm crushed, but that's unlikely with only one of each card on board\n- Two pair (76, 72, 62): I'm behind, but also unlikely they called preflop with these\n- One pair (7x, 6x, 2x): I'm ahead\n- Overpair (88-QQ): I'm ahead\n- Draws: I'm ahead\n\nSo I'm ahead of most of their range. I should raise for value.\n\nGiven the pot is 78 and I need to call 26, if I raise to around 70-80:\n- I'm building the pot\n- Charging draws\n- Not overcommitting if a scary card comes\n\nLet me go with a raise to 75. That's about 2.9x their bet, which is reasonable.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise again - it's to 52 total. That's only adding 26 more. That seems too small. I should raise more.\n\nLet me think about tournament dynamics. I have 19 BB, which is a decent stack but not huge. I don't want to get into a tricky spot on later streets. With aces, I want to get value now.\n\nA good sizing would be to raise to about 75-85 total. Let me go with 78 to match the pot size, or maybe a bit more.\n\nActually, let me be more aggressive. The board has some draw potential. I should charge them. I'll raise to 80 total.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. If I"

Going all-in maximizes pressure on draws and extracts value from weaker pairs or flush draws before a scary river card can kill my action.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My position: BTN (Seat 1)\n- My cards: As Ad (pocket aces!)\n- My stack: 78 chips (9.8 BB)\n- Board: 2c 6s 7s 2s\n- Pot: 202 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (DeepSeek-V3.2 checked)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have pocket aces on a board of 2c 6s 7s 2s. This is a very strong hand, but the board is concerning:\n- There are two 2s, so full houses are possible\n- Three spades (6s, 7s, 2s) means a flush draw is out there\n- The board is somewhat coordinated with 6-7\n\nHowever, I still have a very strong hand. Let me think about the betting:\n- Preflop: I raised to 24, DeepSeek-V3.2 called\n- Flop: DeepSeek-V3.2 bet 26, I raised to 75, they called 49\n- Turn: DeepSeek-V3.2 checked\n\nThe fact that they bet on the flop and then checked the turn suggests they might have been on a draw or have a medium-strength hand. They could have:\n- A flush draw (spades)\n- A straight draw\n- A pair (like 6x, 7x)\n- Or they could have a monster and be trapping\n\n**My stack situation:**\nI only have 78 chips left, and the pot is 202 chips. This is a critical tournament situation. I have about 9.8 BB left.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the search results, I can see DeepSeek-V3.2 has been fairly active. They:\n- Raised preflop in hand 48 with unknown cards\n- Called preflop in hand 52 with A4\n- Raised preflop in hand 53 with unknown cards and made a 35 chip bet on the flop\n- Folded multiple times as well\n\nThey seem to be a thinking player who can both raise and fold.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that I have pocket aces, the pot is already 202 chips, and I only have 78 chips left, I should be looking to get all my chips in. The turn check from my opponent could mean:\n1. They're giving up on a draw\n2. They're scared of the flush\n3. They're trapping with a monster\n\nBut with pocket aces, I can't afford to just check here. I need to:\n1. Protect my hand against draws\n2. Extract value from worse hands\n3. Take down the pot now if they're weak\n\nSince I can only raise to 49 minimum, but I have 78 total, I should just go all-in. This maximizes pressure and gives draws bad odds to call.\n\nLet me check if raising to 49 (the minimum) makes sense vs going all-in. Given my short stack and the pot size, going all-in is much better. If I raise to 49, I'm leaving 29 chips behind which is awkward.\n\nActually, wait. Let me re-read the rules. The \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount I'm putting in. So if I want to go all-in with my remaining 78 chips, I should set \"raise_to\": 78.\n\nBut I need to check if 78 is at least the minimum raise of 49. Yes, 78 > 49, so it's a valid raise.\n\nThe key here is that with pocket aces on this board, facing a check, and with a short stack, I should be betting for value and protection. Going all-in puts maximum pressure and ensures I realize my equity.",

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with 8c 9d, facing a raise to 24 from Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking). The pot is 36, and I need to call 16 more. My stack is 288 chips (36 BB).\n\nLooking at opponent data: Seat 1 has raised preflop multiple times with varying amounts (8, 12, 16, 24, 36). They seem to be raising with a wide range. They've shown some weak hands at showdown: Js 3c, Ts Qh, Ac 2c. This suggests they might be raising with speculative hands.\n\nMy hand: 8c 9d is a suited connector (well, suited? No, 8c 9d are offsuit). Actually it's offsuit. 98o is a marginal hand, but can make straights. I'm getting 36:16 pot odds, which is about 2.25:1. I need about 31% equity to call.\n\nPosition: I'm out of position (BB vs UTG raiser). That's a disadvantage.\n\nStack sizes: I have 288 (36 BB), opponent has 153 (19 BB). They're shorter stacked than me. If I call and hit a flop, I could potentially stack them.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (36 BB). Folding loses only my blind (8 chips). Calling risks 16 more chips.\n\nLooking at my recent hands: I've been folding a lot (46 folds out of 55 hands). I won hand 48 with A5s from BTN, hand 53 with AJ from BTN. I'm playing tight.\n\nThis is a borderline decision. 98o vs a likely wide UTG raising range. I'm getting decent pot odds (2.25:1). The implied odds could be good if I hit a strong hand (straight, two pair, trips) against a shorter stack.\n\nHowever, being out of position with a marginal hand is tough. The opponent has shown they can raise with weak hands, but they might also have stronger hands.\n\nLet me think about ranges: UTG raising range might include pairs, broadways, suited connectors, maybe some Ax hands. Against that range, 98o has about 35-40% equity preflop. That's enough to call given pot odds.\n\nBut postflop play will be difficult OOP. I could consider a 3-bet bluff, but with 98o that's risky against a shorter stack who might shove.\n\nActually, looking at opponent's stack (153), they have less than 20 BB. Their raise to 24 is about 3x BB. If I call, pot will be 52, and they'll have 129 left (16 BB). If I hit a flop hard, I could potentially get their stack.\n\nAlternative: fold and preserve chips. 98o is not a great hand to defend with OOP.\n\nWait, I should also consider that there were already folds, so it's heads-up. That improves my situation slightly.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern to opponent's raises: looking at the raise amounts: 8, 8, 12, 36, 12, 16, 24, 16. The 24 raise is on the larger side but not the largest (they raised to 36 in hand 27).\n\nDecision: I think I should call. The pot odds are decent, implied odds could be good against a shorter stack, and opponent has shown a wide raising range. I'll need to play carefully postflop and likely fold if I miss.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Getting 2.25:1 pot odds with 98o against UTG raiser who has shown wide raising range with weak hands (Js3c, TsQh, Ac2c).

Amount to call is 0 because there's no bet currently? Wait, the actions show preflop: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 24 total, I called 16 more. Now on the flop, it's my turn. No bet yet, so I can check. But I can also raise.\n\nLet me analyze: I have 8c9d, board is 2c6s7s. That's a great flop for me! I have an open-ended straight draw (5-8-9-T for straight, actually need a 5 or T). Wait, board: 2c 6s 7s. My hand: 8c 9d. So I have 8-9, board 6-7. That gives me an open-ended straight draw: any 5 or 10 gives me a straight. That's 8 outs. Also I have a pair of 8s? No, board has no 8. I have 8 high. But I have a gutshot to a straight? Actually, 5-6-7-8-9: I need a 5. Also 6-7-8-9-T: I need a T. That's two cards to complete the straight: 5 and T. That's 8 outs (four 5s, four Ts). However, there are two spades on board, so flush draw possible. I have no spades. So I'm drawing to a straight.\n\nPosition: I'm BB, opponent is Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) who raised preflop. They have 153 chips (19 BB). They raised from UTG? Actually seat 1 is UTG? Let's see: seats: 1,2,3,4,5. I'm seat 3 (BB). Seat 1 is UTG? Actually positions: seat 4 is button? Wait, need to know button position. Not given. But likely seat 4 is button (folded). So seat 1 is UTG? Or maybe seat 5 is button? Not sure. Anyway, opponent raised preflop, I called from BB.\n\nNow on flop, I have position? Actually I'm BB, so I act first? Wait, action this hand: preflop actions: seat 2 post SB, seat 3 (me) post BB, seat 4 fold, seat 5 fold, seat 1 raise 24, seat 2 fold, seat 3 call 16. So after preflop, there are two players: seat 1 (raiser) and me (BB). On flop, the action starts with the first player after the button? Usually the player to the left of the button acts first. Button is seat 4 (folded). So the first player to act is seat 5 (folded), then seat 1, then seat 2 (folded), then me. But seat 5 folded preflop, so seat 1 is first to act post-flop. However, the display says \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check, raise\". That suggests it's my turn to act, and there's no bet to call. That means seat 1 checked? Or maybe the action is on me because seat 1 already acted? Let me think: The flop is dealt, and the first player to act is the player to the left of the button who is still in the hand. That's seat 5, but they folded. Next is seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking). They must have checked, because otherwise there would be an amount to call. So seat 1 checked the flop. Now it's my turn. I can check, raise, or fold.\n\nThus I have position advantage (I act after opponent). I have a strong draw: open-ended straight draw, 8 outs. That's about 32% equity on the turn (8/47 \u2248 17% per card, but with two cards to come it's about 31.5%). Actually rule of 2 and 4: 8 outs * 4 = 32% equity. However, there is flush draw on board, so if opponent has flush draw, my straight may be beaten by a flush. But I can also improve to two pair or trips, though unlikely.\n\nPot is 52 chips. If I check, pot stays 52. If I raise, I can try to take it down now, or build pot for when I hit. My stack is 272, opponent has 153. If I raise, I can"

            "reasoning_content": "I'm in the BB with 8c9d on a 2c6s7s board. I have 272 chips (34 BB). The pot is 52 chips. The action is on me, and I can check, raise, or fold. Amount to call is 0 because there's no bet currently? Wait, the actions show preflop: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 24 total, I called 16 more. Now on the flop, it's my turn. No bet yet, so I can check. But I can also raise.\n\nLet me analyze: I have 8c9d, board is 2c6s7s. That's a great flop for me! I have an open-ended straight draw (5-8-9-T for straight, actually need a 5 or T). Wait, board: 2c 6s 7s. My hand: 8c 9d. So I have 8-9, board 6-7. That gives me an open-ended straight draw: any 5 or 10 gives me a straight. That's 8 outs. Also I have a pair of 8s? No, board has no 8. I have 8 high. But I have a gutshot to a straight? Actually, 5-6-7-8-9: I need a 5. Also 6-7-8-9-T: I need a T. That's two cards to complete the straight: 5 and T. That's 8 outs (four 5s, four Ts). However, there are two spades on board, so flush draw possible. I have no spades. So I'm drawing to a straight.\n\nPosition: I'm BB, opponent is Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) who raised preflop. They have 153 chips (19 BB). They raised from UTG? Actually seat 1 is UTG? Let's see: seats: 1,2,3,4,5. I'm seat 3 (BB). Seat 1 is UTG? Actually positions: seat 4 is button? Wait, need to know button position. Not given. But likely seat 4 is button (folded). So seat 1 is UTG? Or maybe seat 5 is button? Not sure. Anyway, opponent raised preflop, I called from BB.\n\nNow on flop, I have position? Actually I'm BB, so I act first? Wait, action this hand: preflop actions: seat 2 post SB, seat 3 (me) post BB, seat 4 fold, seat 5 fold, seat 1 raise 24, seat 2 fold, seat 3 call 16. So after preflop, there are two players: seat 1 (raiser) and me (BB). On flop, the action starts with the first player after the button? Usually the player to the left of the button acts first. Button is seat 4 (folded). So the first player to act is seat 5 (folded), then seat 1, then seat 2 (folded), then me. But seat 5 folded preflop, so seat 1 is first to act post-flop. However, the display says \"Amount to call: 0\" and \"Legal actions: fold, check, raise\". That suggests it's my turn to act, and there's no bet to call. That means seat 1 checked? Or maybe the action is on me because seat 1 already acted? Let me think: The flop is dealt, and the first player to act is the player to the left of the button who is still in the hand. That's seat 5, but they folded. Next is seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking). They must have checked, because otherwise there would be an amount to call. So seat 1 checked the flop. Now it's my turn. I can check, raise, or fold.\n\nThus I have position advantage (I act after opponent). I have a strong draw: open-ended straight draw, 8 outs. That's about 32% equity on the turn (8/47 \u2248 17% per card, but with two cards to come it's about 31.5%). Actually rule of 2 and 4: 8 outs * 4 = 32% equity. However, there is flush draw on board, so if opponent has flush draw, my straight may be beaten by a flush. But I can also improve to two pair or trips, though unlikely.\n\nPot is 52 chips. If I check, pot stays 52. If I raise, I can try to take it down now, or build pot for when I hit. My stack is 272, opponent has 153. If I raise, I can",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to decide. Opponent \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\" raised preflop from early position (seat 1). Looking at their actions: they raised in hand 50 preflop to 16 (likely from late position?). In hand 54 they checked preflop (was in BB?). They seem somewhat tight but not extremely. They raised this hand to 24 preflop, which is a 3x raise (blinds 4/8, so raise to 24 is 3x BB). That's a standard raise.\n\nNow on flop, they checked. This could indicate weakness, or they're trapping with an overpair? Board is 2c6s7s, low cards. If they have an overpair (like TT+, maybe 99, 88?), they might bet for protection. But they checked. Could be they have AK/AQ missed, or maybe a medium pair like 99-TT that wants to pot control. Or they have a draw themselves (maybe spades, or straight draw). Or they have a set and are slowplaying.\n\nI have an open-ended straight draw, 8 outs. Pot is 52. If I bet, I can try to take it down now. If I get called, I have good equity. My stack is 272, opponent has 153. If I raise, I should consider sizing. Minimum raise to 16 (that's total? Actually minimum raise to 16 means I need to raise to at least 16 total? Wait, amount to call is 0, minimum raise to: 16. That means if I raise, the smallest raise I can make is to 16 total chips in the pot? Actually typical: if no bet, the minimum bet is the big blind (8). But here minimum raise to 16 suggests the minimum bet is 8, and minimum raise is to 16? Actually \"minimum raise to: 16\" likely means the minimum total amount I can put in is 16 chips. Since amount to call is 0, I can bet any amount from 8 to all-in. But if I want to raise (bet), the minimum is 8 (big blind). But the interface says \"minimum raise to: 16\". That might be a misinterpretation. Let me think: In no-limit, if there's no bet, you can bet any amount at least the big blind. So minimum bet is 8. The \"minimum raise to: 16\" might be if there was a bet, but there isn't. So I think I can bet as low as 8. But to be safe, I'll consider betting around half pot to 3/4 pot.\n\nIf I bet, say 26 (half pot), and opponent calls, pot becomes 104. Then turn, I have position. If I hit my straight, I can win a big pot. If I miss, I can check or bet again depending.\n\nAlternatively, I could check and see a free turn. That's also fine since I have a draw. But checking gives opponent a free card if they have a draw. However, I have position, so I can check behind and see turn for free.\n\nGiven opponent checked, they might be weak. A bet could win the pot now. I have 8-high, no pair, but with a draw. Betting for semi-bluff is good. I should bet.\n\nLet me consider stack sizes: opponent has 153, I have 272. If I bet 26, opponent calls, pot 104, opponent remaining stack 127. Then on turn, if I hit, I can potentially get all-in. Good implied odds.\n\nI'll bet around half pot. Let's say 26 chips. That's a reasonable semi-bluff.\n\nBut need to consider tournament: I have 34 BB, opponent has 19 BB. I'm in good shape. Winning this pot would increase my stack. Losing 26 chips isn't devastating.\n\nI'll bet 26. Let's calculate: pot is 52, bet 26, total pot would be 78 if called. That's about half pot.\n\nDecision: raise to 26. Let's output JSON.",

Wait, let me calculate:\n  - Preflop pot: 8 (BB) + 4 (SB) + 24 (raise) + 16 (my call) = 52\n  - Flop: I bet 26, opponent raised to 75 (so added 49 more)\n  - Total pot: 52 + 75 + 26 = 153? Actually opponent's raise includes calling my 26 then raising 49 more\n  - So total pot = 52 + 26 + 49 = 127? Let me recalculate:\n    - Preflop: 8+4+24+16 = 52\n    - Flop: I bet 26 \u2192 pot = 78\n    - Opponent raises to 75 total (calls 26, raises 49 more) \u2192 pot = 78 + 49 = 127\n    - I need to call 49 to win 127\n    - Pot odds: 49/(127+49) = 49/176 \u2248 28%\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- Me: 246 chips (started with 246, invested 8+16+26=50, have 196 left)\n- Opponent: 78 chips total (has already put in 24+75=99? Wait, that's more than his stack... Actually he only has 78 total, so his raise to 75 leaves him with just 3 chips behind)\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's stack: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 78 chips\"\nHe started with 78, preflop raised to 24, leaving 54. Now on flop he raised to 75 total, which is more than his remaining stack. This means he's effectively all-in with his raise to 75.\n\nSo if I call 49, the pot will be: 127 + 49 = 176, and opponent will have 3 chips left behind.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have an open-ended straight draw (8 outs: four 5s and four 10s)\n- Also have a pair of 8s (could be good if opponent has overcards)\n- Flush draw on board (two spades) - I don't have spades\n- Opponent's range: UTG raiser preflop, then raises flop when I bet\n- Opponent's likely hands: overpairs (88+), sets (66,77,22), strong draws (flush draw with overcards), maybe two pair\n- My hand is vulnerable: if I hit my straight, it's to the 5 or T, which could be dominated if opponent has a higher straight draw\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 30.8 BB, opponent has 9.75 BB (effectively all-in)\n- This is a good spot to accumulate chips if I think I have good equity\n- Folding leaves me with ~24.5 BB (196 chips)\n\n**Equity calculation:**\nAgainst a reasonable range (overpairs, sets, strong draws), my 89o has about 30-35% equity on this flop. Pot odds are 28%, so it's close to a break-even call.\n\nHowever, there's a key factor: opponent is effectively all-in. If I call, we see turn and river with no further betting. This means I get to see both cards for my draw.\n\nAlso, opponent only has 3 chips behind after this, so implied odds are minimal.\n\nGiven the pot odds of 28% and my estimated equity of 30-35%, this is a marginal call. But considering:\n1. I have position (acted first on flop, but will see both cards if I call)\n2. Opponent is effectively all-in\n3. Tournament: accumulating chips from a short stack is valuable\n4.

Wait, let me calculate:\n  - Preflop pot: 8 (BB) + 4 (SB) + 24 (raise) + 16 (my call) = 52\n  - Flop: I bet 26, opponent raised to 75 (so added 49 more)\n  - Total pot: 52 + 75 + 26 = 153? Actually opponent's raise includes calling my 26 then raising 49 more\n  - So total pot = 52 + 26 + 49 = 127? Let me recalculate:\n    - Preflop: 8+4+24+16 = 52\n    - Flop: I bet 26 \u2192 pot = 78\n    - Opponent raises to 75 total (calls 26, raises 49 more) \u2192 pot = 78 + 49 = 127\n    - I need to call 49 to win 127\n    - Pot odds: 49/(127+49) = 49/176 \u2248 28%\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- Me: 246 chips (started with 246, invested 8+16+26=50, have 196 left)\n- Opponent: 78 chips total (has already put in 24+75=99? Wait, that's more than his stack... Actually he only has 78 total, so his raise to 75 leaves him with just 3 chips behind)\n\nActually, looking at the opponent's stack: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 78 chips\"\nHe started with 78, preflop raised to 24, leaving 54. Now on flop he raised to 75 total, which is more than his remaining stack. This means he's effectively all-in with his raise to 75.\n\nSo if I call 49, the pot will be: 127 + 49 = 176, and opponent will have 3 chips left behind.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have an open-ended straight draw (8 outs: four 5s and four 10s)\n- Also have a pair of 8s (could be good if opponent has overcards)\n- Flush draw on board (two spades) - I don't have spades\n- Opponent's range: UTG raiser preflop, then raises flop when I bet\n- Opponent's likely hands: overpairs (88+), sets (66,77,22), strong draws (flush draw with overcards), maybe two pair\n- My hand is vulnerable: if I hit my straight, it's to the 5 or T, which could be dominated if opponent has a higher straight draw\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 30.8 BB, opponent has 9.75 BB (effectively all-in)\n- This is a good spot to accumulate chips if I think I have good equity\n- Folding leaves me with ~24.5 BB (196 chips)\n\n**Equity calculation:**\nAgainst a reasonable range (overpairs, sets, strong draws), my 89o has about 30-35% equity on this flop.

            "reasoning_content": "Now I have more context. Looking at the opponent's history: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been fairly tight, mostly folding preflop. In hand 50, they raised to 16 preflop. In hand 54, they checked through streets and made a small river bet of 10.\n\nMy own history shows I've been playing somewhat tight, with a 16% win rate over 55 hands.\n\nBack to the current hand analysis:\n- I have 8c 9d on 2c 6s 7s board\n- Open-ended straight draw (8 outs)\n- Pair of 8s (could be good if opponent has overcards)\n- Opponent has 78 chips total, effectively all-in with his raise to 75\n- I need to call 49 to win 127 (pot odds: 49/176 = 28%)\n- My equity against a reasonable range is about 30-35%\n- Opponent's range: UTG raiser, then raises flop when I bet. Could be overpairs (88+), sets, strong draws like flush draws with overcards, maybe two pair.\n\nGiven the pot odds of 28% and equity of 30-35%, this is a slightly +EV call. Also, opponent is effectively all-in, so I get to see both cards. The 3 chips left behind are negligible.\n\nHowever, there's tournament consideration: I have 30.8 BB, opponent has 9.75 BB. If I fold, I still have a healthy stack. If I call and lose, I drop to about 24.5 BB. If I call and win, I eliminate a short stack and gain chips.\n\nThe marginal +EV plus tournament chip accumulation makes this a call. The opponent's history shows they're not overly aggressive, so their raise likely represents real strength, but my draw is good enough.\n\nI should call.",

Only one recent raise (hand 50, preflop raise to 16). They tend to check a lot postflop when they don't have strong hands.\n\n**Pot odds and stack sizes:**\n- Pot: 202 chips\n- Opponent has only 78 chips left (less than pot size)\n- I have 197 chips\n\n**Possible opponent hands:**\n1. Flush: Could have AsXs, KsXs, QsXs, JsXs, TsXs\n2. Overpair: Could have 88-AA\n3. Two pair: 67, 76, maybe 72s\n4. Set: 66, 77, 22 (but 22 unlikely)\n5. Straight draw: Similar to mine\n6. Bluff: Could be semibluffing with spade draw\n\n**My equity:**\n- Straight draw: 8 outs (four 5s, four 10s) = ~16% equity\n- If opponent has flush, my straight outs might be tainted if spades\n- If opponent has set or two pair, my straight might still win\n\n**Decision:**\nI have position on the turn (check to me). The pot is 202, opponent has only 78 left. If I bet and they call, they're essentially committing their stack. Given they raised flop, they likely have something decent. The flush just got there, which is scary.\n\nHowever, I have some fold equity if I bet, and I'm getting decent pot odds if I hit my straight on river. But betting here commits me to the pot since opponent only has 78 left.\n\nBetter to check and see a free river. If I hit my straight, I can then bet/raise. If I miss, I can fold to a bet or check behind.\n\nActually wait - I'm out of position (BB). Opponent checked to me, so I should check back to see free river. Yes, check is the right play.\n\n**Final decision:** Check and see free river. If I hit straight, I can value bet. If I miss, evaluate based on opponent action."

            "content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand:** 8c 9d\n**Board:** 2c 6s 7s 2s\n**Pot:** 280 chips\n**Amount to call:** 78 chips\n**My stack:** 197 chips\n**Opponent:** Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) - currently has 0 chips according to the hand info, but that seems odd since they just bet 78. Might be an error in display.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have 8c 9d on a board of 2c 6s 7s 2s. This gives me an open-ended straight draw (5-8-9-T) - I need a 5 or T to complete the straight. I also have middle pair with 9s, but the board is paired with 2s and has three spades (flush possible). The turn brought a 2s, which paired the board and completed a potential flush.\n\n**Betting history:**\n- Preflop: Opponent raised to 24, I called with 8-9 offsuit from BB (questionable call but okay for implied odds)\n- Flop: I bet 26 (small bet), opponent raised to 75, I called 49\n- Turn: I checked, opponent bet 78\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** From the data, Kimi-K2 Thinking raises preflop frequently but I don't see many post-flop actions. No showdowns found, so no hand reading data. The opponent's flop raise after my small bet suggests strength - could be top pair, overpair, flush draw, or made hand.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 280 chips, need to call 78. That's 78/(280+78) = 78/358 = ~21.8% equity needed.\n\n**My equity:** With open-ended straight draw (8 outs: four 5s and four Ts). However, some of those outs might complete a flush if opponent has a flush draw. Also, if opponent already has a flush, my straight might be beat. My 9 might be good if opponent is bluffing or has a weaker hand. Let's estimate conservatively: 8 outs = ~16% equity on river (with one card to come). But I also have implied odds if I hit.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 197 chips total. After calling 78, I'll have 119 left. If I call and hit my straight on river, I could potentially get more chips.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 24.6 BB, which is a medium stack. This is a significant portion of my stack (78/197 = ~40%).\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. The opponent's flop raise was strong - 75 into a pot of ~66 (my 26 bet + his call of 26 + original pot). That's a big raise.\n2. The turn bet of 78 into 202 pot (280-78?) is about 39% pot bet - continuation bet sizing.\n3. I have a draw but the board is scary with flush and paired board.\n4. The opponent might have: overpair (QQ-AA), two pair (7-6, 6-2), set (6s, 7s), flush (has spades), or even a bluff with AsX.\n\n**Conclusion:** My equity is marginal at best. The pot odds require ~22% equity, and I have maybe 16% with clean outs, but some outs might be dirty if opponent has flush. The implied odds are decent if I hit, but I'm facing a strong opponent who has shown aggression. With my tournament life at risk (calling 40% of stack), I should fold.\n\nHowever, let me check if there's any history of this opponent bluffing or being aggressive post-flop. I'll search for more data."

Ace-rag from UTG is too vulnerable and marginal to justify calling 8 chips, especially when I could face raises from better-positioned players. I should wait for a stronger hand or better position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Fold Ace-rag from UTG position.

They did call once and then checked through to the river where they bet 16 chips. They seem somewhat passive but capable of betting when they have something.\n- **Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**: This player has shown more aggression, raising to 24 chips in one hand and betting 35 on the flop. They've also folded quite a bit recently.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Position**: UTG is the worst position to play Ace-rag from. With multiple players left to act behind me, I have a high risk of being raised or having better hands call.\n2. **Hand strength**: As3c is playable but not strong enough to be raising from UTG. It's vulnerable to being dominated by any Ace with a higher kicker.\n3. **Stack preservation**: At 22.5 BB, I need to be selective about which hands I play to avoid tournament elimination.\n4. **Pot odds**: I'm getting 2:1 pot odds (8 to call for a 12 chip pot), but this doesn't justify playing a marginal hand from a bad position.\n\nGiven that I'm UTG with Ace-rag and facing a call of 8 chips, this is a clear fold. The hand is too weak to play from this position, especially with potentially aggressive players behind me. I should wait for a better spot.\n",

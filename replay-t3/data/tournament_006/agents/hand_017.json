It's offsuit, no connectivity, low cards. This is a clear fold in almost all situations from SB.\n\n**Position Considerations:**\nI'm in SB with BB still to act. If I call, BB might raise. Even if BB calls, I'll be out of position postflop with a terrible hand.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nPot is 9 chips, need to call 5 chips. Pot odds: 5/(9+5) = 5/14 \u2248 35.7%. My hand equity against a reasonable raising range is far below this.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have 104.5 BB, healthy stack. No need to gamble with trash hands. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n**Decision:**\nClear fold. 8\u26602\u2666 is unplayable from SB facing a raise, especially with BB still to act. Even if BB folds, playing this hand out of position is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"8\u26602\u2666 is one of the worst possible hands.

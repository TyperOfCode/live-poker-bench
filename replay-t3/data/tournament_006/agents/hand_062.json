            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- Position: UTG (Seat 1) - very early position\n- Cards: 6h 5c\n- Stack: 268 chips (16.8 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Amount to call: 16\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 6h 5c is a very weak hand. It's unsuited and disconnected low cards. This is a clear fold in almost all situations.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - you have to act first post-flop and there are 7 players left to act behind you. This makes playing marginal hands even more dangerous.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 16.8 BB is a short stack, but not desperate yet. With a short stack, we need to be selective about which hands we play. 65o is definitely not a hand to risk our tournament life on.\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: With 16.8 BB, we should be looking for spots to either shove all-in preflop with strong hands or steal blinds from late position. Playing speculative hands like 65o from UTG with a short stack is -EV.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: We need to call 16 to win 24, which is 1.5:1 odds. Even with these odds, 65o is just too weak, especially from UTG.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. We should preserve our stack for better opportunities.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold based on basic poker fundamentals. 65o from UTG with a short stack is an easy fold, no need to recall opponent tendencies.",

However, being out of position in the SB is a disadvantage. With the opponent showing some tightness, a 3-bet could take down the pot preflop. But my stack is too shallow for fancy play - I should either fold or go all-in.\n\nActually, let me calculate: My stack is 201, I've already put in 8. To call is 32 more, leaving me with 161.

This meets the 33% pot odds requirement.\n\n2. **Position disadvantage:** Being in SB means I'll be out of position for the entire hand, which reduces my postflop profitability.\n\n3. **Stack considerations:** With 12.6 BB, I'm getting short. I need to accumulate chips soon, but also can't afford to bleed chips.\n\n4. **BB still to act:** If I call, BB might squeeze or call, creating a multiway pot. Multiway pots favor suited connectors, but being out of position is worse.\n\n5. **Alternative plays:**\n   - **Fold:** Preserve stack for better spot\n   - **Call:** Take flop with decent pot odds\n   - **Raise/3-bet:** Apply pressure, but commits significant portion of stack\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that:\n1. Pot odds are good (33% equity needed vs ~35-40% actual)\n2. JTs plays well postflop with draws and pair potential\n3. Opponent's raise size (2.5x BB) suggests moderate strength\n4. My stack is getting short and I need chips\n\nI should call. Folding is too tight given the pot odds and hand strength. Raising is too aggressive out of position with a drawing hand.

The pot is 96 chips, which is significant relative to our stacks.\n\n**Draw analysis:**\n- Gutshot straight draw: 4 outs (Kings) = ~16% equity\n- Backdoor flush draw: ~4% equity if we see both turn and river\n- Overcard outs: Jacks and Tens might be good sometimes, but opponent likely has overpairs or Qx\n- Total equity estimate: ~20-25% against a typical raising range\n\n**Pot odds:** If I check and opponent bets, I'll need to evaluate. Currently, no bet to call.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 10.6 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate. Need to pick spots carefully.\n\n**Decision options:**\n1. **Check:** Standard with marginal hand out of position. See what opponent does.\n2. **Raise:** Semi-bluff with draws. Could take it down now or build pot if I hit.\n\nGiven the dry board and my drawing hand, checking seems most reasonable. I have some showdown value if I improve, but not enough to bet for value. A raise would be committing with marginal equity and out of position.\n\nIf I check and opponent bets small, I might call with my draws. If they bet large, I should fold.\n\nLet me check the recall again to see if opponent tends to continuation bet after raising preflop. Looking at hand #51: they raised preflop (24), then checked flop and turn, bet river. So they might not always c-bet.\n\nGiven all this, I'll check and see what opponent does.",

            "content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with Jh Th. The board is Qd 6d 2h. I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 9 for a straight), backdoor flush draw (hearts), and overcard to the board (J high). The pot is 144 chips and opponent bet 48 into it. I need to call 48 to win 192 (144+48). That's pot odds of 4:1 (48 to win 192).\n\nMy opponent (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) has 124 chips total. They raised preflop to 40 (2.5x BB) and now bet 48 on the flop. Looking at their history: they've been fairly tight, folding many hands preflop. They've shown some aggression with a river bet in hand 51 and a flop raise in hand 37. They have a relatively short stack of 124 chips.\n\nMy stack is 169 chips. If I call, I'll have 121 left (169-48). The opponent will have 76 left after their bet (124-48-48? Wait, they started with 124, raised to 40 preflop, now bet 48 on flop. So they have 124-40-48=36 left).\n\nActually recalculating: Opponent started with 124. Preflop they raised to 40, so they put 40 in. Now they bet 48 on flop, so total invested 88. They have 36 left. I started with 169, put in 8 SB + 32 call preflop = 40 total. If I call 48 more, I'll have 81 left (169-40-48).\n\nThe board is Qd 6d 2h. My hand Jh Th has:\n- Gutshot straight draw (4 outs: 9s)\n- Backdoor flush draw (hearts) \n- Overcard J (3 outs if J is good, but could be dominated)\n- Backdoor straight possibilities\n\nTotal clean outs: maybe 4 for the gutshot. The J might be good sometimes but could also be dominated by QJ, AJ, KJ. The backdoor draws add some equity.\n\nWith 4 clean outs, I have about 16% equity to hit by the turn. Pot odds are 48 to win 192 = 25% required. So not getting direct pot odds.\n\nHowever, implied odds: if I hit my straight on the turn, I might get opponent's remaining 36 chips. But that's not much. Also, I have position (I'm BB, they acted first on flop, but I'll act first on turn since they're UTG? Wait, seat 2 is UTG? Actually seat order: 1, 2, 3 (me), 4, 5. So seat 2 is UTG, I'm BB. On flop, I checked, they bet. On turn, they'll act first.\n\nGiven opponent's short stack (36 left), if I call and hit my straight on turn, I could potentially get their remaining chips. But they only have 36 left, so maximum implied odds are small.\n\nAlso considering tournament situation: I have 10.6 BB, opponent has 7.75 BB. We're both short-stacked. This is a marginal spot.\n\nLooking at opponent's tendencies: they've shown some aggression but also folded a lot. Their bet of 48 into 144 is 1/3 pot bet, which could be a continuation bet with a wide range.\n\nMy hand has some showdown value if I improve, but currently J high is weak.\n\nAlternative: I could raise as a semi-bluff. I have some equity and fold equity. If I raise, I could represent a Q or better. Minimum raise to 96 would put me all-in essentially (I'd have 73 left after raising to 96? Wait: I have 169 total, already invested 40, so 129 left. Raise to 96 total means putting in 56 more (96-40). Actually no: I need to think in terms of total bet: opponent bet 48, so to raise to 96, I need to put in 96 total. I already have 40 in, so need 56 more. That would leave me with 113 left.\n\nBut actually looking at stack sizes more carefully: I have 169 total. Preflop: I posted SB 8, called 32 more = 40 total invested. So I have 129 left. Pot is 144. Opponent bet 48. To call: put in 48 more, leaving 81 behind. To raise to min 96: put in 96 total from my current investment of 40, so add 56 more, leaving 73 behind.\n\nIf I raise, I'm committing a"

            "content": "Now I have more information. Opponent (Kimi-K2) has shown:\n- Mostly folding preflop (tight)\n- One preflop raise in hand 57 to 24 (1.5x BB)\n- One flop raise in hand 37 to 80 (was that a check-raise?)\n- Showdown hands: 9h Jc (weak) and Jh Ac (decent)\n\nTheir current bet of 48 into 144 is a 1/3 pot bet. This could be a continuation bet with a wide range after raising preflop. They raised to 40 preflop (2.5x BB) which is larger than their previous raise of 24.\n\nMy hand: Jh Th on Qd 6d 2h board. I have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs to a 9), backdoor flush draw, and overcard J. Against a typical UTG raising range (which might be tighter given their folding tendencies), my equity is marginal.\n\nPot odds: need to call 48 to win 192 (144+48). That's 25% equity needed. My immediate equity is around 16-20% if I count some J outs and backdoor draws. Not getting direct odds.\n\nImplied odds: opponent has only 36 chips left. If I hit my straight on turn, I could potentially get those chips. But not huge.\n\nFold equity if I raise: I could semi-bluff raise. Opponent has shown one flop raise in hand 37, but generally seems tight. A raise might get them to fold medium strength hands like AJ, KJ, TT, 99, etc. But they only have 36 chips left, so they might feel committed.\n\nStack sizes: I have 169 total (10.6 BB), opponent has 124 (7.75 BB). We're both short. If I call and miss turn, I'll have 81 left (5 BB) and will be in bad shape. If I raise and get called, I'm likely behind but have some equity.\n\nConsidering tournament: I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips. This is marginal but could be a good semi-bluff spot given opponent's tight image and small remaining stack.\n\nIf I raise to 96 (min raise), I put in 56 more (96 total). That leaves me with 73 behind. Pot would be 144 + 48 + 56 = 248. Opponent would need to call 48 more (96-48) with 36 left, so they'd be all-in. They'd be getting 248:48 = 5.2:1 odds, so they'd likely call with any piece.\n\nBetter to go all-in? I have 129 left after my 40 investment. If I go all-in for 129 more (169 total), pot would be 144 + 48 + 129 = 321. Opponent would need to call 81 more (129-48) with 36 left, so they're all-in anyway.\n\nActually, opponent only has 36 left total. So if I raise any amount that requires them to put in more than 36, they're all-in. They've already put in 88 (40 pre + 48 flop). They have 36 behind.\n\nSo if I raise to any amount > 124 (their total stack), they're all-in. Minimum raise to 96 is less than their stack, so they could just call.\n\nBut wait: they have 124 total. They put 40 pre, 48 flop = 88. Have 36 left. To call a raise to 96, they need to put in 48 more (96-48), but they only have 36 left. So they'd be all-in for 36 more. Actually the math: they've put 48 on flop. To match a raise to 96, they need to put in 48 more (96-48), but they only have 36. So they'd be all-in for their remaining 36. The raise would be to 96, but they can only call 36 more.\n\nSo effectively any raise puts them all-in.\n\nGiven this, a raise commits me to the hand. I have ~16% equity if behind, maybe 30% if I have some fold equity. But they're short and likely to call with any piece.\n\nBetter to fold or call? Calling costs 48, leaving me with 81. If I miss turn, I'll have to fold to another bet. But opponent only has 36 left, so they might check turn if they're weak.\n\nActually, if I call, pot will be 240 (144+48+48). Opponent has 36 left. They might push all-in on any turn regardless. If I call flop and then fold to a 36 bet on turn when I miss, that would be bad - getting 7:1 odds"

            "content": "I need to make a decision. Let me think through the options clearly:\n\n1. Fold: I lose my 40 invested. Safe play given marginal equity.\n\n2. Call: Put in 48 more. If I hit my straight (4 outs = ~8% chance on turn), I can likely get opponent's remaining 36 chips. If I hit a J (3 outs, but might not be good), maybe win. Backdoor draws add some equity. Pot odds: need 25% equity, I have maybe 16-20%. Not quite there.\n\n3. Raise: Could semi-bluff. Opponent has only 36 left, so any raise essentially puts them all-in. They're getting good odds to call (pot will be large relative to their 36 call). They'll likely call with any piece. So raising probably doesn't have much fold equity.\n\nGiven opponent's tight tendencies (folding a lot preflop), their UTG raise range might be stronger: pairs 77+, AQ, AJs, KQ, maybe some suited connectors. On Qd 6d 2h board, they could have:\n- Top pair: AQ, KQ, QJ, QT\n- Overpairs: JJ, TT, 99, 88, 77\n- Draws: AdKd, AdJd, etc.\n- Air: AK, AJ no diamond\n\nTheir 1/3 pot bet could be a continuation bet with many hands. But given their stack size (short), they might be betting for protection/value with a medium strength hand.\n\nMy Jh Th has some equity against many hands: against top pair QJ, I have ~25% equity. Against overpair JJ, I have ~15%. Against AQ, I have ~20%.\n\nIf I call, I'll have 81 left (5 BB) on turn. That's playable but short. If I miss turn and face a bet, I'll have to fold getting good odds.\n\nActually, if opponent bets 36 all-in on turn, pot would be 240+36=276, I'd need to call 36 to win 276 = 7.7:1 odds. I'd need only ~11% equity. Even with just gutshot (4 outs = ~8%), plus maybe some J outs or backdoor, I'd have to call. So calling flop commits me to calling turn if opponent goes all-in.\n\nSo calling flop is effectively committing my stack if opponent bets turn (which they likely will with only 36 left).\n\nThus, it's either fold now or go all-in now. Going all-in now gives me fold equity. Opponent might fold hands like 99, TT, AJ, KJ. They're getting about 2:1 pot odds if I go all-in (pot would be ~321, they need to call 36 more). With 2:1 odds, they need 33% equity. Many hands have that against me.\n\nBut if they have a weak hand like AK no diamond (6 outs = ~24% equity), they might fold. Or AJ (pair of Js, but I have J blocking).\n\nActually, let's calculate: If I go all-in for my remaining 129 (total 169), pot would be: current 144 + opponent's 48 + my 129 = 321. They need to call 36 more (their last 36). They're getting 321:36 = 8.9:1 odds. That's huge! They'd need only 10% equity to call. Almost any hand would call getting 9:1. Even 72o has ~15% equity against my Jh Th.\n\nSo raising has virtually no fold equity given the pot odds they're getting.\n\nThus, raising is bad - I'm just building a bigger pot when likely behind.\n\nSo it's between fold and call.\n\nCalling: I put in 48 more. If I hit on turn (8% chance), I can likely get their last 36. My implied odds: if I hit straight, I win at least 240 + their 36 = 276. My investment is 48. That's 5.75:1 implied odds. For a 4-outer (8.5% chance), I need about 11:1 odds. Not getting that.\n\nBut wait, I might also win if I hit a J and it's good, or hit backdoor flush/straight. But those are less likely.\n\nOverall, folding seems best. Marginal hand, marginal equity, opponent likely has a decent hand given UTG raise and c-bet, and I'm not getting proper odds.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been in similar spots. Use recall_my_hands."

Wait, that's not right.\n\nActually, if I go all-in:\n- I put in 129 more (total 169)\n- Opponent has already put in 48, needs to call 36 more (total 84)\n- Pot would be: 144 (pre) + 129 (my all-in) + 36 (opponent's call) = 309? No.\n\nLet me think: Current pot is 144. Opponent bet 48. If I go all-in for 129 more (total 169), opponent needs to call 36 more (their last 36). Total pot = 144 + 169 + 36 = 349. I'm risking 129 to win 144+48+36 = 228? That's not the right way to think.\n\nBetter: My equity needed = risk / (risk + reward). Risk = 129. Reward = pot before my action = 144 + 48 = 192. So risk 129 to win 192 = 40% equity needed.\n\n40% equity is more than I likely have (25-30%).\n\nIf I just call: Risk 48 to win 192 = 25% equity needed. That's closer to my actual equity.\n\nBut calling commits me to likely calling turn all-in. So total risk = 48 + 36 = 84 to win 144 + 48 + 36 = 228? Actually, if I call flop and call turn all-in:\n- Total investment = 48 (flop) + 36 (turn) = 84\n- Total pot at end = 144 + 48 + 48 + 36 + 36 = 312\n- I'm risking 84 to win 228 (312-84) = 27% equity needed.\n\n27% equity is about what I have.\n\nBut this assumes opponent always bets turn. They might check turn with weak hands. But with only 36 left, they'll likely bet any turn.\n\nGiven opponent's tight image (folding a lot preflop), their UTG raise range is probably stronger. My Jh Th might have less equity against a tighter range.\n\nLet me use search_observations to see if there's info on opponent's c-bet tendencies or similar hands."

            "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with Jh Th. The board is Qd 6d 2h. I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 9 for a straight), backdoor flush draw (hearts), and overcard to the board (J high). The pot is 144 chips and opponent bet 48 into it. I need to call 48 to win 192 (144+48). That's pot odds of 4:1 (48 to win 192).\n\nMy opponent (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) has 124 chips total. They raised preflop to 40 (2.5x BB) and now bet 48 on the flop. Looking at their history: they've been fairly tight, folding many hands preflop. They've shown some aggression with a river bet in hand 51 and a flop raise in hand 37. They have a relatively short stack of 124 chips.\n\nMy stack is 169 chips. If I call, I'll have 121 left (169-48). The opponent will have 76 left after their bet (124-48-48? Wait, they started with 124, raised to 40 preflop, now bet 48 on flop. So they have 124-40-48=36 left).\n\nActually recalculating: Opponent started with 124. Preflop they raised to 40, so they put 40 in. Now they bet 48 on flop, so total invested 88. They have 36 left. I started with 169, put in 8 SB + 32 call preflop = 40 total. If I call 48 more, I'll have 81 left (169-40-48).\n\nThe board is Qd 6d 2h. My hand Jh Th has:\n- Gutshot straight draw (4 outs: 9s)\n- Backdoor flush draw (hearts) \n- Overcard J (3 outs if J is good, but could be dominated)\n- Backdoor straight possibilities\n\nTotal clean outs: maybe 4 for the gutshot. The J might be good sometimes but could also be dominated by QJ, AJ, KJ. The backdoor draws add some equity.\n\nWith 4 clean outs, I have about 16% equity to hit by the turn. Pot odds are 48 to win 192 = 25% required. So not getting direct pot odds.\n\nHowever, implied odds: if I hit my straight on the turn, I might get opponent's remaining 36 chips. But that's not much. Also, I have position (I'm BB, they acted first on flop, but I'll act first on turn since they're UTG? Wait, seat 2 is UTG? Actually seat order: 1, 2, 3 (me), 4, 5. So seat 2 is UTG, I'm BB. On flop, I checked, they bet. On turn, they'll act first.\n\nGiven opponent's short stack (36 left), if I call and hit my straight on turn, I could potentially get their remaining chips. But they only have 36 left, so maximum implied odds are small.\n\nAlso considering tournament situation: I have 10.6 BB, opponent has 7.75 BB. We're both short-stacked. This is a marginal spot.\n\nLooking at opponent's tendencies: they've shown some aggression but also folded a lot. Their bet of 48 into 144 is 1/3 pot bet, which could be a continuation bet with a wide range.\n\nMy hand has some showdown value if I improve, but currently J high is weak.\n\nAlternative: I could raise as a semi-bluff. I have some equity and fold equity. If I raise, I could represent a Q or better. Minimum raise to 96 would put me all-in essentially (I'd have 73 left after raising to 96? Wait: I have 169 total, already invested 40, so 129 left. Raise to 96 total means putting in 56 more (96-40). Actually no: I need to think in terms of total bet: opponent bet 48, so to raise to 96, I need to put in 96 total. I already have 40 in, so need 56 more. That would leave me with 113 left.\n\nBut actually looking at stack sizes more carefully: I have 169 total. Preflop: I posted SB 8, called 32 more = 40 total invested. So I have 129 left. Pot is 144. Opponent bet 48. To call: put in 48 more, leaving 81 behind. To raise to min 96: put in 96 total from my current investment of 40, so add 56 more, leaving 73 behind.\n\nIf I raise, I'm committing a",

            "reasoning_content": "Now I have more information. Opponent (Kimi-K2) has shown:\n- Mostly folding preflop (tight)\n- One preflop raise in hand 57 to 24 (1.5x BB)\n- One flop raise in hand 37 to 80 (was that a check-raise?)\n- Showdown hands: 9h Jc (weak) and Jh Ac (decent)\n\nTheir current bet of 48 into 144 is a 1/3 pot bet. This could be a continuation bet with a wide range after raising preflop. They raised to 40 preflop (2.5x BB) which is larger than their previous raise of 24.\n\nMy hand: Jh Th on Qd 6d 2h board. I have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs to a 9), backdoor flush draw, and overcard J. Against a typical UTG raising range (which might be tighter given their folding tendencies), my equity is marginal.\n\nPot odds: need to call 48 to win 192 (144+48). That's 25% equity needed. My immediate equity is around 16-20% if I count some J outs and backdoor draws. Not getting direct odds.\n\nImplied odds: opponent has only 36 chips left. If I hit my straight on turn, I could potentially get those chips. But not huge.\n\nFold equity if I raise: I could semi-bluff raise. Opponent has shown one flop raise in hand 37, but generally seems tight. A raise might get them to fold medium strength hands like AJ, KJ, TT, 99, etc. But they only have 36 chips left, so they might feel committed.\n\nStack sizes: I have 169 total (10.6 BB), opponent has 124 (7.75 BB). We're both short. If I call and miss turn, I'll have 81 left (5 BB) and will be in bad shape. If I raise and get called, I'm likely behind but have some equity.\n\nConsidering tournament: I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips. This is marginal but could be a good semi-bluff spot given opponent's tight image and small remaining stack.\n\nIf I raise to 96 (min raise), I put in 56 more (96 total). That leaves me with 73 behind. Pot would be 144 + 48 + 56 = 248. Opponent would need to call 48 more (96-48) with 36 left, so they'd be all-in. They'd be getting 248:48 = 5.2:1 odds, so they'd likely call with any piece.\n\nBetter to go all-in? I have 129 left after my 40 investment. If I go all-in for 129 more (169 total), pot would be 144 + 48 + 129 = 321. Opponent would need to call 81 more (129-48) with 36 left, so they're all-in anyway.\n\nActually, opponent only has 36 left total. So if I raise any amount that requires them to put in more than 36, they're all-in. They've already put in 88 (40 pre + 48 flop). They have 36 behind.\n\nSo if I raise to any amount > 124 (their total stack), they're all-in. Minimum raise to 96 is less than their stack, so they could just call.\n\nBut wait: they have 124 total. They put 40 pre, 48 flop = 88. Have 36 left. To call a raise to 96, they need to put in 48 more (96-48), but they only have 36 left. So they'd be all-in for 36 more. Actually the math: they've put 48 on flop. To match a raise to 96, they need to put in 48 more (96-48), but they only have 36. So they'd be all-in for their remaining 36. The raise would be to 96, but they can only call 36 more.\n\nSo effectively any raise puts them all-in.\n\nGiven this, a raise commits me to the hand. I have ~16% equity if behind, maybe 30% if I have some fold equity. But they're short and likely to call with any piece.\n\nBetter to fold or call? Calling costs 48, leaving me with 81. If I miss turn, I'll have to fold to another bet. But opponent only has 36 left, so they might check turn if they're weak.\n\nActually, if I call, pot will be 240 (144+48+48). Opponent has 36 left. They might push all-in on any turn regardless. If I call flop and then fold to a 36 bet on turn when I miss, that would be bad - getting 7:1 odds",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to make a decision. Let me think through the options clearly:\n\n1. Fold: I lose my 40 invested. Safe play given marginal equity.\n\n2. Call: Put in 48 more. If I hit my straight (4 outs = ~8% chance on turn), I can likely get opponent's remaining 36 chips. If I hit a J (3 outs, but might not be good), maybe win. Backdoor draws add some equity. Pot odds: need 25% equity, I have maybe 16-20%. Not quite there.\n\n3. Raise: Could semi-bluff. Opponent has only 36 left, so any raise essentially puts them all-in. They're getting good odds to call (pot will be large relative to their 36 call). They'll likely call with any piece. So raising probably doesn't have much fold equity.\n\nGiven opponent's tight tendencies (folding a lot preflop), their UTG raise range might be stronger: pairs 77+, AQ, AJs, KQ, maybe some suited connectors. On Qd 6d 2h board, they could have:\n- Top pair: AQ, KQ, QJ, QT\n- Overpairs: JJ, TT, 99, 88, 77\n- Draws: AdKd, AdJd, etc.\n- Air: AK, AJ no diamond\n\nTheir 1/3 pot bet could be a continuation bet with many hands. But given their stack size (short), they might be betting for protection/value with a medium strength hand.\n\nMy Jh Th has some equity against many hands: against top pair QJ, I have ~25% equity. Against overpair JJ, I have ~15%. Against AQ, I have ~20%.\n\nIf I call, I'll have 81 left (5 BB) on turn. That's playable but short. If I miss turn and face a bet, I'll have to fold getting good odds.\n\nActually, if opponent bets 36 all-in on turn, pot would be 240+36=276, I'd need to call 36 to win 276 = 7.7:1 odds. I'd need only ~11% equity. Even with just gutshot (4 outs = ~8%), plus maybe some J outs or backdoor, I'd have to call. So calling flop commits me to calling turn if opponent goes all-in.\n\nSo calling flop is effectively committing my stack if opponent bets turn (which they likely will with only 36 left).\n\nThus, it's either fold now or go all-in now. Going all-in now gives me fold equity. Opponent might fold hands like 99, TT, AJ, KJ. They're getting about 2:1 pot odds if I go all-in (pot would be ~321, they need to call 36 more). With 2:1 odds, they need 33% equity. Many hands have that against me.\n\nBut if they have a weak hand like AK no diamond (6 outs = ~24% equity), they might fold. Or AJ (pair of Js, but I have J blocking).\n\nActually, let's calculate: If I go all-in for my remaining 129 (total 169), pot would be: current 144 + opponent's 48 + my 129 = 321. They need to call 36 more (their last 36). They're getting 321:36 = 8.9:1 odds. That's huge! They'd need only 10% equity to call. Almost any hand would call getting 9:1. Even 72o has ~15% equity against my Jh Th.\n\nSo raising has virtually no fold equity given the pot odds they're getting.\n\nThus, raising is bad - I'm just building a bigger pot when likely behind.\n\nSo it's between fold and call.\n\nCalling: I put in 48 more. If I hit on turn (8% chance), I can likely get their last 36. My implied odds: if I hit straight, I win at least 240 + their 36 = 276. My investment is 48. That's 5.75:1 implied odds. For a 4-outer (8.5% chance), I need about 11:1 odds. Not getting that.\n\nBut wait, I might also win if I hit a J and it's good, or hit backdoor flush/straight. But those are less likely.\n\nOverall, folding seems best. Marginal hand, marginal equity, opponent likely has a decent hand given UTG raise and c-bet, and I'm not getting proper odds.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've been in similar spots.

            "reasoning_content": "I need to provide a JSON response with action, raise_to, and reasoning. Let me think about the hand:\n\n- I have Jh Th on Qd 6d 2h board\n- Opponent bet 48 into 144 (1/3 pot)\n- I need to call 48\n- My stack: 169, opponent: 124\n- I have gutshot straight draw (4 outs to 9), backdoor flush draw, overcard J\n- Pot odds: 48 to win 192 = 25% equity needed\n- My equity against a typical range: maybe 20-25% if opponent has a wide c-betting range\n- Opponent is short-stacked (36 left after this bet)\n- Any raise puts opponent all-in given their stack\n- Raising has little fold equity because opponent gets huge pot odds to call (9:1)\n- Calling commits me to calling a likely all-in on turn (36 into ~276 = 7.7:1)\n- If I call flop and miss turn, I'll have to call 36 to win 276 (only need 11% equity)\n\nActually, let me calculate more precisely. If I call flop:\n- Pot after flop call: 144 + 48 + 48 = 240\n- Opponent has 36 left\n- If opponent goes all-in on turn for 36, pot becomes 276\n- I need to call 36 to win 276 = 7.7:1 odds = 11.5% equity needed\n- Even with just gutshot (4 outs = ~8.5% on river), plus maybe J outs or backdoor, I'd have to call\n- So calling flop commits me to the hand\n\nThus, I'm effectively deciding whether to play for my stack of 169.\n\nMy equity if all-in now: Against a reasonable range (pairs 77+, AQ, AJs, KQ, some suited connectors), Jh Th has about 25-30% equity on Qd 6d 2h.\n\nPot odds if all-in: My stack is 169, but I already have 40 invested. To go all-in, I'd put in 129 more. Total pot would be: current 144 + opponent's 48 + my 129 = 321. Opponent needs to call 36 more. From my perspective, I'm risking 129 to win 144+48+36 = 228? Wait, that's not right.\n\nActually, if I go all-in:\n- I put in 129 more (total 169)\n- Opponent has already put in 48, needs to call 36 more (total 84)\n- Pot would be: 144 (pre) + 129 (my all-in) + 36 (opponent's call) = 309? No.\n\nLet me think: Current pot is 144. Opponent bet 48. If I go all-in for 129 more (total 169), opponent needs to call 36 more (their last 36). Total pot = 144 + 169 + 36 = 349. I'm risking 129 to win 144+48+36 = 228? That's not the right way to think.\n\nBetter: My equity needed = risk / (risk + reward). Risk = 129. Reward = pot before my action = 144 + 48 = 192. So risk 129 to win 192 = 40% equity needed.\n\n40% equity is more than I likely have (25-30%).\n\nIf I just call: Risk 48 to win 192 = 25% equity needed. That's closer to my actual equity.\n\nBut calling commits me to likely calling turn all-in. So total risk = 48 + 36 = 84 to win 144 + 48 + 36 = 228? Actually, if I call flop and call turn all-in:\n- Total investment = 48 (flop) + 36 (turn) = 84\n- Total pot at end = 144 + 48 + 48 + 36 + 36 = 312\n- I'm risking 84 to win 228 (312-84) = 27% equity needed.\n\n27% equity is about what I have.\n\nBut this assumes opponent always bets turn. They might check turn with weak hands. But with only 36 left, they'll likely bet any turn.\n\nGiven opponent's tight image (folding a lot preflop), their UTG raise range is probably stronger. My Jh Th might have less equity against a tighter range.\n\nLet me use search_observations to see if there's info on opponent's c-bet tendencies or similar hands.",

This offsuit 5-2 has very little equity against any reasonable range and offers minimal playability.\n\n**Current Situation**:\n- Pot: 96 chips, need to call 24 to continue\n- Stack: 122 chips (7.6 BB) - getting short but manageable\n- Seat 2 raised to 40 chips (likely has a decent hand)\n- Seat 3 called from SB (could be positionally aggressive or have a decent hand)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**:\nFrom recent history, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been mostly folding but raised here, suggesting strength. Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has been mostly folding preflop but called, which could indicate a playable hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. While I'm getting 4:1 pot odds due to my BB position, 5-2 offsuit is simply too weak to play profitably in this spot. Even if I hit the flop, I have very little implied odds with such a weak hand, and I'm likely dominated by any reasonable opponent range.\n\nTournament considerations also favor folding - I need to preserve my 7.6 BB stack for a better spot rather than burning chips on the worst possible hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"5d 2c is one of the weakest starting hands. Despite pot odds from BB position, the hand has minimal equity and playability. Better to preserve my 7.6 BB stack for a stronger spot.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 5d 2c - This is a very weak hand, essentially the worst possible 5-2 offsuit combination. This hand has very little equity and is almost always a fold.\n\n**Position**: I'm in the Big Blind (BB) position, which gives me the advantage of seeing the flop cheaply.\n\n**Current Situation**:\n- Pot size: 96 chips\n- Amount to call: 24 chips \n- My stack: 122 chips (7.6 BB)\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 40 chips preflop\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) called 32 chips (they were in the small blind)\n\n**Analysis of Opponents**:\nFrom my recall of recent hands:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been mostly folding, with some raises and calls. They raised to 40 which suggests they have a decent hand.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has been mostly folding preflop but did make a big raise in the last hand (56 chips). They're calling here which could mean they have a decent hand or are being positionally aggressive.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**:\n- My stack is 122 chips (7.6 BB), which is getting short but not critical yet\n- I need to be careful about preserving my tournament life\n- With such a weak hand (5-2 offsuit), the risk/reward doesn't justify calling\n\n**Pot Odds**:\n- Pot is 96 chips, I need to call 24 chips\n- That's 4:1 pot odds, but with 5-2 offsuit, I have very little equity against likely ranges\n\n**Decision**:\nThis is clearly a fold. 5-2 offsuit is one of the worst possible hands in poker. Even though I'm getting a \"discount\" to see the flop due to my BB position, the hand is so weak that it's not worth calling 24 chips to potentially lose more postflop. \n\nThe marginal pot odds don't justify the significant risk of playing this extremely weak starting hand. Folding preserves my tournament life and allows me to wait for a better opportunity.",

Need to decide.\n\nConsider hand strength: T-J offsuit (unsuited). In early position, generally not a good hand, especially short stack. With 10.8 BB, you could consider a push/fold strategy. At 10.8 BB, many players would push or fold. T-J offsuit is marginal for push; but maybe can call and see flop? But with 16 call, you'd be left with 157 chips after call, still decent. However, the action before you: seat 3 posted small blind 8, seat 4 posted big blind 16. No raises yet. So you can either call 16 or raise. Raising to 32 would be a 2x raise. With 10.8 BB, raising might isolate and maybe get called by later players (positions later). But you are UTG, many players left to act (positions 6-8). Raising may get re-raised. Probably better to fold or push all-in? But you have 10.8 BB; typical push range includes T-J? Some push/fold tables push with any Ace, broadway, maybe T-J suited, but offsuit is weaker. I think fold is safe.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: we could recall opponent actions. But limited time. Might recall that Kimi-K2 (seat 1) is aggressive? Not sure.\n\nGiven short stack, need to preserve chips. T-J offsuit is not strong enough to risk. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON.",

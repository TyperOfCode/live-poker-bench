The button is a great position, but K2o is simply not playable in most situations.\n\n**Position:** Button (BTN) - best position at the table\n**Stack:** 216 chips (108 BB) - healthy stack\n**Blinds:** 1/2\n**Pot:** 3 chips\n**Amount to call:** 2 chips (1 BB)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB): Has shown aggression preflop with a raise from SB in Hand #1 with 4s6s. They're willing to play speculative hands from SB.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, BB): Folded to a raise in Hand #1, but that was from BB facing a raise.\n\n**My History:** I've played 2 hands - won one with TT and folded one with 64s.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** K2o is terrible. King-rag offsuit has very little postflop playability. Even on the button, this hand should be folded.\n2. **Position:** While button is great, it doesn't make K2o playable. At best, we're hoping to hit a King and have it hold up, but with a weak kicker.\n3. **Pot Odds:** We're getting 3:2 pot odds (3 in pot, 2 to call). That's 1.5:1, which isn't terrible, but we need implied odds to make up for the weak hand.\n4. **Stack Preservation:** With 108 BB, we have plenty of chips to wait for better spots. No need to play marginal hands.\n5. **Tournament Considerations:** We want to accumulate chips but not risk them on terrible hands.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n- Fold: Clearly the best option. Save our chips.\n- Call: Might be tempting from button, but K2o will often be dominated when we hit a King.\n- Raise: Would be a pure bluff with no equity. Not recommended with such a weak hand.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an easy fold. We're on the button, but K2o is simply not playable. We should wait for better spots with our healthy stack.",

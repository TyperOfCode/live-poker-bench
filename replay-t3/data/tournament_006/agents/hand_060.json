            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: Kd Jh (King of diamonds, Jack of hearts) - This is a decent but not premium hand. It's suited in diamonds, which gives some potential.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position post-flop, I get to act last.\n\n**Stack**: 268 chips (33.5 BB) - Healthy stack, above 30 BB.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 28 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 raised to 16 (2x the big blind)\n- I need to call 12 to see the flop\n- Minimum raise is to 24\n\nLet me analyze MiniMax-M2's tendencies from the data:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been very tight, folding most hands preflop\n- They raised to 16 in hand 58 (same sizing as now)\n- In hand 59, they called 8, then called 16, then called 30 on flop before folding on turn\n- They seem to play straightforwardly - raises likely indicate strength\n\nSince they've been folding frequently and this is their second raise in recent hands, this raise likely indicates a strong hand range (premium pairs, strong broadway hands).\n\n**My hand equity**: KJ suited is decent but dominated by many hands in a tight player's raising range (AK, AQ, AJ, KQ). I have about 40-45% equity against a typical raising range.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 12 to win 28 chips, getting about 2.3:1 odds. This is marginal with KJ suited.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have 33.5 BB, which is comfortable but not huge\n- The blinds are relatively high (4/8)\n- I need to accumulate chips, but I don't want to get into marginal spots against a tight player\n\n**Decision**: With KJ suited on the button, getting 2.3:1 pot odds against a tight player who just raised, I should:\n1. Fold - too marginal against a tight player's range, risk of being dominated\n2. Call - could be profitable with position and suited hand\n3. Raise - would be aggressive but risky against a tight player\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 is tight and this is a raise (not just a limp), their range is strong. KJ suited is often dominated by their range. While I have position, the risk of being dominated and the marginal pot odds suggest folding is the safest play. However, with 33.5 BB, I can afford to see a flop in position with a decent suited hand.\n\nI think calling is the best option - I have position, a suited hand with good potential, and enough chips to see the flop. If I hit, I can potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Against a tight player who raises, KJ is often dominated. The pot odds aren't great (2.3:1). And while I have position, I'm risking 12 chips (1.5 BB) on a marginal hand. \n\nI think folding is the most disciplined play here. Save my chips for better spots against this tight player.",

Blinds are 4/8.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot (50 folds out of 59 hands, win rate 15.3%). From the opponent actions I can see:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has raised preflop once (hand 56)\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop once (hand 57)  \n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has raised preflop once (hand 58) and called twice (hand 59)\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop twice (hands 55, 59)\n\nSo opponents are occasionally raising preflop, but not excessively.\n\nAs UTG with 2-8 offsuit, this is an easy fold. The hand has virtually no playability:\n1. Very low high-card strength\n2. No suitedness for flush potential\n3. No connectivity for straight potential\n4. Being offsuit reduces even the minimal value\n\nIn tournament poker, especially with 24 BBs, I should be playing tight from early position. With 2-8o, I'm dominated by almost any hand that calls or raises behind me. Even if I call the BB (8 chips), I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand with a weak hand.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for a better spot. The 8 chips to call represents about 4% of my stack, which isn't huge, but playing this hand OOP is likely to lose more chips postflop.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity."

My stack is 193 chips (24.1 BB). Blinds are 4/8.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot (50 folds out of 59 hands, win rate 15.3%). From the opponent actions I can see:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has raised preflop once (hand 56)\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop once (hand 57)  \n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has raised preflop once (hand 58) and called twice (hand 59)\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop twice (hands 55, 59)\n\nSo opponents are occasionally raising preflop, but not excessively.\n\nAs UTG with 2-8 offsuit, this is an easy fold. The hand has virtually no playability:\n1. Very low high-card strength\n2. No suitedness for flush potential\n3. No connectivity for straight potential\n4. Being offsuit reduces even the minimal value\n\nIn tournament poker, especially with 24 BBs, I should be playing tight from early position. With 2-8o, I'm dominated by almost any hand that calls or raises behind me. Even if I call the BB (8 chips), I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand with a weak hand.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for a better spot. The 8 chips to call represents about 4% of my stack, which isn't huge, but playing this hand OOP is likely to lose more chips postflop.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

Actually SB 4, BB 8, then seat4 raise 16). So we face a raise of 16 (to call 16). Minimum raise to 24 (i.e., raise at least 8 more). Our hand: 3d Tc, a Ten low suited (clubs? Actually Ten of clubs? It's Tc, clubs, but 3d diamond). So T3 offsuit (but suited? Ten clubs, three diamonds, so unsuited). That's a weak hand. In BTN vs a raise from MP? Seat4 is maybe MP (position unknown). We have 21.6 BB, short stackish but not super short. Should we fold? Likely yes. Hand is weak, not a good call. Opponent's raise size is 2x BB? Actually raise to 16 is 2x BB (8) plus 8? That's 2 BB raise. That's a standard raise. With T3 off, not good to call. Could consider 3-bet? No, not with T3.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nBut we could check if any opponent tendencies: recall opponent seat4 raise patterns: in hand 58 they raised 16, maybe same size. So they are raising with a range. So folding is safe.\n\nThus JSON.\n\n",

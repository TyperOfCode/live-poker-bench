            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand: 9d 2h** - This is a terrible hand, one of the worst in poker. It's unsuited and disconnected.\n\n**My position: SB** - I'm out of position for the entire hand.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- Me: 177 chips (22.1 BB)\n- BB: 228 chips\n- GPT-OSS-120B (raiser): 91 chips (11.4 BB) - This is important, they're short-stacked\n\n**The action:**\n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 28 chips (4 from me, 8 from BB, 16 from raiser)\n- I need to call 12 more chips to see the flop\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nGPT-OSS-120B has been relatively conservative:\n- Folded 2 hands in a row (hands 51, 52)\n- Called 16 in hand 53 then folded on flop\n- Called 4 in hand 54 (likely BB) then checked down and folded on river\n\nThis suggests they're not super aggressive. Their raise to 16 (2x the BB) from the CO position with a short stack could be:\n1. A legitimate strong hand\n2. A steal attempt with position\n3. Desperation play with a short stack\n\n**Pot odds:** \nI need to call 12 to win 28, so 12:28 or roughly 2.33:1. This means I need ~30% equity to break even.\n\n**My hand equity:** 9-2 offsuit has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against random hands, 9-2o only has about 35% equity, and against a tight raising range it would be much worse (likely < 25%).\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (22 BB)\n- The raiser is short-stacked (11.4 BB) and may be getting desperate\n- However, playing 9-2o out of position is a recipe for disaster\n- If I call and miss the flop (which is very likely), I'll be in a tough spot out of position\n- I could potentially squeeze raise to isolate the short stack, but with 9-2o this is very risky\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. 9-2o is unplayable in this spot, especially out of position. Even though the raise is small and the pot odds seem okay, the reverse implied odds are terrible. I'll lose much more than 12 chips when I hit a weak hand like top pair with a 9 and get outkicked, or when I completely miss and have to fold to continuation bets.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9-2 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker.

The blinds are 4/8.\n\nLooking at opponent behavior from the search results:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1) raised to 16 from SB in hand 50 with Q2s. Seems somewhat aggressive.\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2) called from BB in hand 51 with 95o, then bet river when checked to. Seems willing to play speculative hands.\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) seems tight - folded to my raise in hand 53, checked BB in hand 52, then bet river when checked to.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) called my raise with something in hand 53, then folded to flop bet. Also limped SB in hand 54.\n\nMy hand history shows I've been folding a lot (45 folds out of 54 hands, 9 wins). I won hand 53 with AJ from BTN.\n\nWith Ten-five offsuit from UTG, this is an easy fold. The hand has almost no playability postflop. Even if I hit a pair, it's a weak pair with bad kicker. No straight potential (gap of 5 cards between T and 5), no flush potential (offsuit).\n\nI'm UTG with 4 players left to act after me. If I call or raise, I'll be out of position against most of the table. Better to preserve my stack and wait for a better spot.\n\nPot odds: 8 to call into 12 pot (1.5:1), but implied odds are bad because I'll be out of position with a weak hand.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 37 BB, not desperate. No need to play marginal hands from bad position.\n\nDecision: Fold."

UTG is the worst position to play from, as I have to act first postflop and many players can still act after me. \n\nLooking at my stack: 296 chips (37 BB). That's a decent stack, not short-stacked. The blinds are 4/8.\n\nLooking at opponent behavior from the search results:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1) raised to 16 from SB in hand 50 with Q2s. Seems somewhat aggressive.\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2) called from BB in hand 51 with 95o, then bet river when checked to. Seems willing to play speculative hands.\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) seems tight - folded to my raise in hand 53, checked BB in hand 52, then bet river when checked to.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) called my raise with something in hand 53, then folded to flop bet. Also limped SB in hand 54.\n\nMy hand history shows I've been folding a lot (45 folds out of 54 hands, 9 wins). I won hand 53 with AJ from BTN.\n\nWith Ten-five offsuit from UTG, this is an easy fold. The hand has almost no playability postflop. Even if I hit a pair, it's a weak pair with bad kicker. No straight potential (gap of 5 cards between T and 5), no flush potential (offsuit).\n\nI'm UTG with 4 players left to act after me. If I call or raise, I'll be out of position against most of the table. Better to preserve my stack and wait for a better spot.\n\nPot odds: 8 to call into 12 pot (1.5:1), but implied odds are bad because I'll be out of position with a weak hand.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 37 BB, not desperate. No need to play marginal hands from bad position.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Hand strength: Jh 6h is a weak suited connector. In UTG position, this is generally considered a fold, especially in a tournament setting where preservation of chips is important.\n\n2. Position: UTG is the worst position to be in. I have to act first against 3 remaining opponents, which means I'm likely to face raises from later positions.\n\n3. Opponent tendencies: Both opponents have been very tight, folding most hands. This suggests they likely have strong hands when they play, making it more dangerous for me to continue with a weak hand.\n\n4. Stack considerations: With 22.5 BB, I'm in a healthy stack size. I don't need to take risks to accumulate chips urgently.\n\n5. Tournament considerations: In tournaments, especially early/middle stages, preservation of chips is crucial. Playing weak hands from UTG position is generally not recommended.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have a weak hand (Jh 6h)\n- I'm in the worst position (UTG)\n- The opponents appear tight, suggesting they have strong ranges\n- I have a decent stack that doesn't require risky plays\n- The call amount (8 chips) is significant relative to my stack (4.4% of stack)\n\nThis should be a clear fold. The risk/reward ratio doesn't justify calling with such a weak hand from UTG position against opponents who appear to have strong ranges.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have BTN with Ac7c, stack 107 chips (13.4 BB). Blinds 4/8, small blind posted by seat1 (4), big blind seat2 (8). So we are facing a big blind (8) and a small blind (4). The amount to call is 8 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Hand: Ace of clubs, 7 of clubs. Suited Ace, decent for button. Stack shallowish (13.4 BB). Consider push/fold? At 13 BB, many push/fold ranges. But we have ability to raise to 16 (i.e., 8 more). That's a small raise (2 BB). Could also call and see flop. Let's consider opponents tendencies: Seat1 (SB) has raised amounts 36,12,16,24,16 in previous hands. So they can be aggressive, sometimes large raises. Seat2 (BB) has raised 6,6,12,12,24 (i.e., sometimes small raises). However in this hand they have posted BB, not yet acted.\n\nWe are BTN. Our hand Ace-7 suited is decent for stealing blinds. At 13 BB, a raise to 16 (2 BB) is a standard raise to 2.5-3 BB from button. That's fine. But we also have a decent chance to be called by BB (who may defend). However BB's stack 228, larger. Their raise tendencies show they raise small amounts sometimes. Could they call? Likely they will call with a wide range. So raising may get called. But our hand may have decent equity vs typical BB defending range. Also we could just call 8, see flop cheap, but we risk being out of position after flop (we are still in position, actually we are still BTN after flop, still last to act). If we call, pot becomes 20 (12+8). With 107 stack, we still have 99 left. Could play postflop.\n\nGiven stack shallow, many players push all-in around 10 BB. Could consider going all-in (raise to 107). But legal raise min is 16; we could raise all-in. However that may be too much with Ace-7 suited vs unknown ranges; but could be good to steal.\n\nWhat is tournament stage? Not given. But stack 13 BB is short, so we might want to preserve chips. A raise of 16 is not huge risk; if called we still have 91 left. That's okay.\n\nThus I think raise to 16 (i.e., 2 BB). Reason: attempt to steal, decent hand, position, and stack size.\n\nWe should check if any opponent has been folding a lot? We saw raises not folds. No data on folds. But SB seems aggressive raising. Could be 3-bet? Actually they are SB, they posted 4, not yet acted. They could 3-bet. If we raise to 16, they'd need to re-raise to at least 32. They have raised 36 in hand 27. So they could 3-bet. But that's okay.\n\nThus decision: raise to 16.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

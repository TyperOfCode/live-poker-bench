            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: 8h Js - This is a marginal hand, offsuit and disconnected. Not a strong starting hand.\n\n**Position**: SB (Small Blind) - This is a terrible position, I'll be out of position post-flop.\n\n**My stack**: 173 chips (21.6 BB) - This is a decent stack, not desperate yet.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Blinds are 4/8\n- GPT-OSS-120B raised to 24 (3x the big blind)\n- I need to call 20 chips to see the flop\n- Pot is currently 36 chips, would be 56 if I call\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Let me look at what GPT-OSS-120B has been doing. From the data:\n- They've been folding a LOT preflop (hands 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44 all folded)\n- They raised in hand 40 to 8 chips (small raise) but then folded\n- They bet 30 on flop in hand 37 but then folded\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is relatively tight and doesn't play many hands. When they do raise to 24 (3x BB), it's likely a real hand, not a steal attempt. They have a short stack of 91 chips (11.4 BB), so they're in \"push/fold\" territory.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 20 to win 36, which is about 1.8:1. This is not great odds for a marginal hand like J8o.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 21.6 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. J8o from SB against a raise from a tight player is a clear fold.\n\n**My action**: Fold. This is an easy decision. I'm out of position with a weak hand against what appears to be a strong range from a tight player. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

I need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise preflop from UTG with 7-9 offsuit.\n\nFirst, let me think about standard poker strategy. 7-9 offsuit is a very weak hand, especially from UTG (early position). In tournament poker, playing weak hands from early position can lead to difficult situations post-flop. With 35.5 BB, I have a decent stack but not deep enough to be playing speculative hands from early position.\n\nThe pot is currently 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8). To call would be 8 chips, which is about 2.8% of my stack. However, calling from UTG with 7-9o is generally not recommended because:\n\n1. I'm out of position for the entire hand\n2. The hand has poor high-card value\n3. It's not suited, so flush potential is limited\n4. Even if I hit a pair, it's a weak pair (7 or 9)\n\nIf I raise, I'd need to make it at least 16 chips total. That would be committing 5.6% of my stack preflop with a weak hand. Raising with this hand from UTG is also not recommended as it could get called by better hands, and I'd be playing a weak hand out of position with a raised pot.\n\nFolding seems like the most prudent choice. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities. In tournament poker, especially with 35.5 BB, I should be looking for stronger starting hands or better positions to accumulate chips.\n\nLet me check if there are any opponent tendencies I should consider, but with 7-9o from UTG, even against weak opponents, this hand is a fold.\n\nI'll respond with the JSON format.",

While I have an Ace, the 6 is weak and doesn't connect well. From UTG position, I need a much stronger hand to play profitably with 5 players left to act behind me.\n\n**Position Considerations**: UTG is the worst position in poker. With so many players left to act, someone is likely to have a better Ace or a stronger hand that can dominate mine.\n\n**My UTG History**: Looking at my previous UTG hands, I've been very tight (folded 32 out of 44 hands), which is correct strategy. When I have played from UTG, it's been with strong hands like AK and KQ.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has shown aggressive tendencies with several preflop raises, but this doesn't change the fundamental weakness of my hand from this position.\n\n**Stack Management**: At 22 BB, I need to be selective and preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n**Decision**: A6o from UTG is too weak to justify calling 8 chips or raising to 16 chips. The risk of being dominated by another Ace or facing stronger hands from later positions is too high.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A6o is too weak to play from UTG position with 5 players left to act. Need to be selective and wait for a stronger hand in this position.\"\n}\n```",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n1. **Hand Analysis**: I have A6o (Ace of clubs, 6 offsuit) in UTG position. This is a marginal hand - Ace-high has potential but the 6 is weak and doesn't connect well with the Ace.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) is the worst position in poker. I have to act first preflop with 5 players left to act behind me. This means I need a stronger hand to play from this position.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 176 chips (22 BB), which is a medium stack. Not short stacked, but not deep either.\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis**: Looking at Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking), I can see they've been active - they've made several raises preflop (16, 24 chips) and have showndown some hands. They seem to be an aggressive player who can fold when faced with resistance.\n\n5. **My UTG History**: From my hand history, I can see I've been very tight from UTG (folded 32 out of 44 hands), which is appropriate. When I have played, I've raised with strong hands like AK and KQ, and they've been profitable.\n\n6. **Current Situation**: \n   - Amount to call: 8 chips (to call the big blind)\n   - Minimum raise to: 16 chips\n   - Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n7. **Decision Framework**:\n   - A6o is not a strong enough hand to raise from UTG with 5 players left to act\n   - Calling might be okay, but with A6o, I'm often dominated if someone else has an Ace\n   - Folding seems like the most prudent decision given the position and hand strength\n\n8. **Tournament Considerations**: At 22 BB, I need to be selective. A6o from UTG is too weak to justify investing chips when there are so many players left to act who could have better hands.\n\n\nThe mathematical analysis reveals the statistical weakness of my current hand. With only a 25% win rate from UTG position and the potential for being outmaneuvered by other players, folding becomes the most strategically sound choice. The marginal nature of A6o means I'm better off preserving my chip stack for a more favorable situation.\n",

With a short stack (14.4 BB) we want to apply pressure and avoid playing out of position.

            "reasoning_content": "We have hand: BTN with As Ts (Ace high, suited? Actually As Ts: Ace of spades, Ten of spades, both spades, so suited Ace-Ten). Stack 115 chips, 14.4 BB (big blind 8). Preflop, SB posted 4, BB posted 8. So pot 12. Action: we are BTN, after SB and BB posted, it's our turn. Amount to call 8 (big blind). Minimum raise to 16 (so raise amount total 16). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: Seat 1 (SB) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 173. Their raise amounts preflop: 12, 36, 12, 16, 24. So they raise various amounts, sometimes 12 (3BB), 16 (2BB?), Actually big blind 8, so 12 is 1.5 BB, 16 is 2 BB, 24 is 3 BB, 36 is 4.5 BB. They seem to raise small to moderate, maybe open-raise? But they are in SB, they posted 4, they can raise. Their raise amounts show they are not just limp; they raise sometimes bigger. Not enough info.\n\nSeat 2 (BB) is Kimi-K2, stack 240. Their raises preflop: 6,6,12,12,24. So they raise 6 (0.75 BB) which is weird maybe a limp? Actually raise to 6 would be raise 6? Wait amount is maybe total? They posted 8 BB, so raise to 6 is less than posted? That seems odd. Might be they called? The data may be inconsistent. But they raise sometimes 12 (1.5 BB), 24 (3 BB). So BB sometimes raises.\n\nNow we have AsTs suited. In BTN, with short stack (14.4 BB) but still enough to raise. Typically we could open raise to 2.5-3 BB (20-24). Since we have decent hand, we could raise to 24 (3 BB) to isolate. Or we could call (just see flop) but with 14 BB maybe want to steal blinds. AsTs is a good hand for steal, suited Ace with decent equity.\n\nBut we need to consider opponent tendencies: SB may raise occasionally; if they raise, we would respond accordingly. But they haven't acted yet; it's our turn. They posted 4; they could raise after us? Actually order: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, then BTN acts. If we raise, SB and BB will act after us. If we call (just match BB), then SB and BB can act (SB could raise or check; BB could check). Usually in BTN you want to raise to steal.\n\nGiven stack sizes: SB 173 (15 BB?), BB 240 (30 BB). Our stack is shortest. So raising may isolate us vs BB or SB. If they both call, pot will be 12 + 8 + raise? Actually if we raise to 16 total (2 BB), then SB must call 12 more (since they posted 4), BB must call 8 more (since posted 8). That would be okay.\n\nBut we need to consider risk: AsTs suited is good but not premium. With short stack, if we get 3-bet, we may be in trouble. However, there is no raise yet; we are first to act.\n\nThus best action: raise to maybe 24 (3 BB) to apply pressure. But minimum raise is 16. We could raise to 24, which is 3 BB. Is that within our stack? Yes we have 115 chips, raising to 24 leaves 91 chips behind.\n\nConsider pot odds: If we call (8) pot becomes 20, we risk 8 to see flop. AsTs suited has about 30% equity vs random. Might be okay but we might be out of position post-flop (SB and BB act before us). Better to raise.\n\nThus I will raise to 24.\n\nNow we need to produce JSON.",

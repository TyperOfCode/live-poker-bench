            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 9h 9d - Pocket nines. This is a strong starting hand, especially in a tournament with 104 BB stacks.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB, which is out of position postflop. This is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6. This is a 3x raise from the BTN/CO position (seat 5 in a 5-player game).\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n   - Very tight preflop: folded in hands 1-9, then started playing more\n   - In hand 10: called preflop, then raised on flop (showing aggression postflop)\n   - In hand 11: raised preflop to 6, then re-raised to 34 (showing very strong hand)\n   - Hands 12-13: folded preflop\n   - Hand 14: called 1, then checked flop and turn, folded to turn bet\n\n   This opponent appears to be relatively tight but capable of making big raises with strong hands. The raise to 6 could be a standard opening, but based on their tight nature, it's likely a strong hand.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 5 to win 9 (SB + BB + raise). That's 5/14 = 35.7% equity needed.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 104 BB, which is a healthy stack. I don't need to take unnecessary risks, but pocket nines are strong enough to play.\n\n7. **Decision factors**:\n   - Pocket nines are strong but vulnerable to overcards\n   - I'm out of position, which makes it harder to realize equity\n   - Opponent appears tight and likely has a strong range\n   - The raise size is standard (3x), not overly large\n   - I have good stack depth to set mine (trying to hit a set)\n\nWith pocket nines, I have a few options:\n- Fold: Too tight, especially with this hand strength and stack depth\n- Call: Reasonable for set mining, but out of position makes it tough\n- Raise: Could 3-bet to take control or get value from weaker hands\n\nGiven that I'm out of position and facing a tight opponent, I think folding is too weak, and calling is reasonable. However, with pocket nines and a tight opponent, a 3-bet could be good to either take the pot preflop or define the opponent's hand strength.\n\nLet me consider a 3-bet sizing. Minimum raise is to 10, which would be a small 3-bet. A more standard 3-bet would be 3x their raise (to 18) or about 15-20 chips.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the opponent's pattern:\n- They raised to 6 in hand 11, then 4-bet to 34 (very large)\n- They seem to play strong hands aggressively\n- They're tight overall\n\nGiven this, if I 3-bet, they might only continue with very strong hands (QQ+, AK), which would put my 99 in bad shape. If they call, I'm out of position with a hand that often flops an overcard.\n\nThe safer play is to call and set mine. I have good implied odds with 104 BB stack vs their 108 BB stack. If I hit a set, I can win a big pot. If I don't hit, I can easily fold to aggression.\n\nI think calling is the best play here. It's conservative but appropriate given my position and opponent's tight nature.",

Looking at their history:\n   - They fold a lot preflop (many folds)\n   - They've raised preflop a few times (hands 11, 14)\n   - In hand 10, they called preflop and then raised on the flop\n   - In hand 11, they raised preflop and then raised again (re-raise)\n   - In hand 14, they called preflop and then checked the flop and turn before folding\n\n   This suggests they can be aggressive but also give up when they miss.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 14 chips and it's checked to me. I can check for free and see the turn.\n\n5. **Board texture**: The board is rainbow (6s Ac 3h - spades, clubs, hearts) with no flush draw. There are some straight possibilities (4-5, 5-7, 7-8) but not many. The Ace is the main concern.\n\n6. **My stack**: I have 203 chips, which is a healthy stack.\n\n**Decision analysis**:\n- I have a medium pocket pair that could be ahead if my opponent doesn't have an Ace\n- The board is relatively dry with no flush draws\n- My opponent raised preflop, which often indicates strength, but could be a wide range\n- I can check for free and see what happens on the turn\n- If I bet, I might fold out worse hands and only get called by better hands (any Ace)\n- Checking allows me to control the pot size and potentially get to showdown cheaply\n\nGiven that I have position and can check for free, I should check here.

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: BB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: 9h 9d (pocket nines)\n- Stack: 203 chips (101.5 BB)\n- Board: 6s Ac 3h Th (Turn)\n- Pot: 14 chips\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 with 216 chips\n\n**Action History:**\n- Preflop: Seat 5 raised to 6, I called 5 (from BB)\n- Flop: I checked, Seat 5 checked\n- Turn: Action is on me\n\n**Current Decision:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n- Minimum raise to: 4\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have pocket 9s\n- Board: 6s Ac 3h Th\n- This is a relatively dry board with one overcard (Ace)\n- I have an overpair to the board (9s vs 6,3,T)\n- However, the Ace is scary as opponent could have Ax\n- No flush draws possible (no 3 of same suit)\n- Straight draws: 45, 57, 89, JQ possible but not very likely\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recalled actions, GPT-OSS-120B has been:\n- Very tight preflop: folded 9 out of 11 preflop opportunities before this hand\n- When they entered hand #10: called preflop, then raised on flop\n- Hand #11: raised preflop to 6, then re-raised to 34 (big aggression)\n- Hand #14: called preflop, checked flop and turn, then folded\n\nThis suggests they're TAG (tight-aggressive). They fold most hands, but when they play, they can be aggressive. The check on flop after raising preflop suggests:\n1. They have a strong hand but are trapping (less likely)\n2. They have a marginal hand that missed the flop (more likely)\n3. They have AK/AQ that missed and are giving up\n\n**Position & Stack:**\n- I'm out of position (BB vs their late position)\n- Both stacks are deep (~100+ BB)\n- Pot is small (14 chips)\n\n**Decision Options:**\n1. **Check**: Show weakness, let them bet if they have something, control pot size\n2. **Bet**: Protect hand, get value from worse hands, charge draws\n3. **Fold**: Too weak with overpair\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- The Ace on board is concerning - they could have AK, AQ, AJ\n- But they checked flop, which weakens their range\n- My hand is vulnerable to overcards\n- I need to protect my hand and get value from worse pairs (77, 88, TT, JJ might call)\n- Checking could induce bluffs but also gives free cards\n\n**Recommended Action:**\nI should make a value bet here. The opponent checked the flop which suggests they don't have a strong Ace. My pocket 9s are likely ahead of their range. A bet will:\n1. Protect against overcards on river\n2. Get value from worse hands\n3. Charge any draws (though few exist)\n4. Define their hand strength\n\nGiven pot is 14, a bet of 8-12 chips seems appropriate. Minimum raise is 4 (which would be a bet of 4), but that's too small. I should bet around 2/3 pot, so about 9-10 chips.\n\nLet me check what the minimum raise to 4 means - this would be a total bet of 4 chips, which is too small. I need to bet more.\n\nI'll bet 10 chips (which is raise_to 10).",

My win rate is 14% over 14 hands.\n\nLooking at opponents: \n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1) has mostly folded preflop, but did bet 10 on turn in hand 14.\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raised to 20 preflop in hand 11, showing aggression.\n\nI have 212 chips (106 BB), which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2, so 2 chips to call.\n\nWith 3s9s in UTG: This is a clear fold. Reasons:\n1. Very weak hand - low suited connectors with a big gap (6 apart)\n2. UTG position - worst position to play marginal hands\n3. 5 players behind who can raise, putting me in difficult spots\n4. Even if I hit a flush draw, it's a low flush vulnerable to higher flushes\n5. Pot odds: 2 chips to call into 3 chip pot (1.5:1) but implied odds poor with weak hand\n6. Tournament consideration: Preserve stack for better spots\n\nThe only reason to play would be if I wanted to be extremely loose, but that's not optimal strategy. Better to wait for stronger hands in better position.\n\nI should fold.",

Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise by at least 2 more). Need decide action.\n\nConsider hand strength: K7 offsuit (7h Ks) is a decent but not premium hand. On button, can open raise. However stack deep 111 BB, so can raise larger.\n\nOpponent tendencies: seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop in two recent hands to 8 (from small blind) likely a raise of 8 (4x BB). That suggests they are willing to raise larger. Seat2 (Kimi-K2) is big blind; unknown.\n\nWe are on button, can either call or raise. In tournament, with 111 BB, can be aggressive. K7o is a marginal hand; many players would raise from button with it, but also can call to see flop cheap. Since we have position, can open raise to maybe 6-8 chips (3-4 BB) to isolate. But we need to consider opponent's likely response: if we raise, seat1 (SB) may 3-bet? They have been raising to 8 (maybe 4x). If we raise to 6, they could 3-bet to 16? Not sure. Our stack is deep; but we risk playing a marginal hand out of position? Actually we have position.\n\nGiven we are button with K7o, typical open raise size is 2.5-3 BB (5-6 chips). Minimum raise is 4 total, which is 2 BB. That's too small; better raise to 6. That is 3 BB total.\n\nWe also consider that we have 111 BB, we can afford a raise. I think raise to 6 chips.\n\nReason: we want to apply pressure, take pot, have position, and our hand has decent equity vs random hands.

Action to act: we are BTN after check, amount to call 0, min raise 4, legal actions: fold, check, raise. We need decide.\n\nOur hand: 7h Ks. On board: Ace high, with 6s, 3h. We have king high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: board 6, A,3. Straight possibilities: 4-5-6-7-8? Not. We have 7, so we have 7,6,? need 5,4 for straight, not present. 7 also could be part of A-2-3-4-5? No. So no straight draw. Flush draw? We have hearts 7h, board hearts: 3h only, so need two more hearts. No flush draw. So we have just king high, no pair. Opponent checked. Likely weak or also missed. Could be they have Ace (maybe they have Ace, something). Could be they have 6x for pair, or a draw like 5-4 for straight draw? Actually 5-4 would give open-ended straight draw (4-5-6-7-8) but need 8 or 2? Wait board 6 A 3. With 5-4, you have 4-5-6, need 2 or 7 for straight. Not immediate. So not typical.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, but we are in position, we could check to see if they bet later. Raising could be a bluff to steal pot (14). Minimum raise 4 => raise to 4 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call 0, raise to 4 means we put 4 chips in. That would be a 4 chip bet, pot becomes 18. Opponent may call with weak hands. Is that a good bluff? Our stack is 216 chips, deep. Opponent stack 203. They are shortish but still decent. They checked. Could be they have Ace high, maybe they will check-turn as well. Might be okay to check and see if they bet later.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: stack sizes moderate, 108 BB. Not huge. Should preserve chips. With king high, we probably should check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have a turn situation. Board: 6s Ac 3h Th. Our hand: 7h Ks. So we have K7 offsuit. Currently we have a gutshot? Board: A, T, 6, 3. We have K7, so currently we have top pair? No, we have no pair. We have a gutshot straight draw? The board has A, T, 6, 3. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q? Not relevant. 7 would give us a straight if 8 and 9 appear? Actually need 8-9 to make 6-7-8-9-10? We have 7, board 6 and T, need 8 and 9. Not a straight draw. Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? We have 7h, board has 3h, so one heart, need two more hearts on river. Not strong.\n\nOpponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking. He bet 10 into pot 24 on turn. So pot before bet 24, his bet 10 makes pot 34 if called. He bet relatively small (about 0.4 pot). Could be a continuation bet, maybe a weak hand or a draw. He checked flop. Preflop he called our raise 6 after we raised from BB? Actually we raised to 6, he called 5 (so put 6 total). Preflop pot after raise: 1+2+6+5 =14? Actually SB 1, BB 2, us raise 6 (so we put 6), he call 5 (since he already posted 2 blind? Wait seat1 is SB, posted 1, then call 5 to match 6 total, so he adds 5). So pot after preflop: SB 1+5 =6, BB 2, us 6 = total 14? plus maybe? Actually pot = 1+2+6+5 =14. Flop: check-check, pot remains 14. Turn: he bets 10, so pot becomes 24 (14+10). Wait given pot is 24 before his bet? The description says Pot: 24 chips before turn? Actually the hand summary says Pot: 24 chips at start of turn. Then he bets 10, amount to call 10. So pot after bet would be 34. So his bet is less than half pot (10 into 24). That's a small bet.\n\nOur stack 216, we have 206 after our raise? Actually we have 216 total, we put 6 preflop, so 210 left. He called 5, so his stack now 188? Not needed.\n\nWe need to decide fold, call, raise. Our hand K7 offsuit, no pair, no draw. Likely we should fold. But we might consider call if we think he is weak and we could bluff later? But we have no equity. The turn bet could be a continuation bet with Ace, Ten, maybe a pair of Ace, Ten, etc. We have no showdown value.\n\nThus best is fold.\n\nWe can also recall opponent tendencies: we have recall of previous turn bet of 10. That previous hand maybe similar? But we just got that info. Not enough.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\n",

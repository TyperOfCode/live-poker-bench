            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Kc 7c - King-7 suited. This is a marginal hand, not particularly strong but has some potential with the King and the clubs suit.\n\n2. **Position**: BB (Big Blind) - I'm out of position postflop.\n\n3. **My stack**: 108 chips (3.4 BB) - I'm very short-stacked. This is a critical tournament situation.\n\n4. **Current action**:\n   - Seat 5 posted SB\n   - I posted BB (32 chips)\n   - Seat 3 raised to 80\n   - Seat 5 (the small blind) raised to 128\n\n5. **Amount to call**: 96 chips\n   - I have 108 chips total\n   - If I call, I'd have 12 chips left\n   - This is essentially committing my entire stack\n\n6. **Pot size**: 240 chips\n   - My pot odds: 240:96 = 2.5:1\n   - I need 28.6% equity to call\n\n7. **Opponents**:\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Raised to 80 from middle position with 170 chips (5.3 BB)\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Only has 5 chips left after posting SB, so their \"raise\" to 128 is actually all-in for 5 chips total. They posted SB 16, so they must have had 21 chips (16+5). After posting SB, they have 5 left.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the action. Seat 5 posted SB 16, then later raised to 128. But they only have 5 chips. This means they went all-in for their remaining 5 chips, and the system is showing it as a raise to 128 but they can only actually put in 5 chips.\n\nActually, let me reread: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 5 chips\" and \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 128\". This is contradictory. If they only have 5 chips, they can't raise to 128. \n\nI realize the raise notation is confusing. The 128 likely represents the total amount Seat 5 would need to call, not their actual chip count. Despite showing 5 chips, the system indicates a raise to 128, which suggests an all-in scenario. The key is understanding the actual chip commitment and potential pot odds, which remain 240:96 with 2.5:1 ratio.\n\nWhen I call 96 chips, the pot will expand to 336, and I'll have 12 chips remaining. With Kc7c, my hand is marginal against potential opponent ranges. I estimate my equity is likely insufficient against probable strong hands like high pairs or high cards.\n\nMy short stack of 3.4 BB severely limits my strategic options. I need to carefully consider shoving or folding based on potential opponent actions and my current chip position.\n\nThe situation is complicated by conflicting information about Seat 5's raise. Despite the unclear details, my pot odds are 2.5:1, which suggests I need around 28.6% equity to justify calling. However, against typical 3-bet ranges, my Kc7c likely falls short of this required equity.\n\nWith an M-ratio of 1.4, I'm critically short-stacked and must make a strategic decision quickly. The original raiser's 80-chip bet and the subsequent all-in from the short stack create a complex scenario that requires careful analysis of potential hand ranges and tournament survival.\n\nI need to conserve my limited chips and wait for a more favorable opportunity. K7s is not a strong enough hand to risk tournament elimination, especially against unknown opponent ranges. The potential 2.5:1 pot odds are tempting, but my hand's low equity makes this a clear fold.\n\nI'll preserve my 108 chips and look for a better spot to make a move, likely in an upcoming hand where I can be the initial aggressor.",

            "content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the button with J9o, stack is 250 chips (7.8 BB). Blinds are 16/32. SB (Seat 5) has 117 chips (3.7 BB), BB (Seat 1) has 108 chips (3.4 BB). Both opponents have very short stacks.\n\nMy hand: J9o is not a great hand, but I'm on the button with two very short-stacked opponents. The SB only has 3.7 BB, and BB has 3.4 BB. They're both in push/fold territory.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B, SB): Has shown some aggression postflop (bet on turn hand 77, bet on flop hand 79), but has folded preflop several times. Has a very short stack.\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking, BB): Has folded preflop a lot (6 of last 10 actions are preflop folds). Only called once preflop in hand 78. Also very short stacked.\n\nMy position is excellent - I'm on the button. With both opponents having stacks under 4 BB, they're likely to shove with any decent hand or fold. \n\nPot odds: I need to call 32 to win 48 (current pot) + 16 (SB's remaining chips if they call) + possibly BB's 108 if they call. Actually, let's think: SB already posted 16, BB posted 32. If I call 32, pot becomes 80. SB has 101 left (117-16), BB has 76 left (108-32). They could potentially shove.\n\nBut actually, if I just call, SB could shove, BB could shove. With J9o, I don't want to play a multi-way pot out of position.\n\nGiven the stack sizes, I should consider raising. I have 250 chips, min raise is to 64 (putting in 32 more). But with such short stacks, a small raise might not accomplish much - they could still shove over the top.\n\nAlternatively, I could shove myself. I have 7.8 BB, which is in the push/fold range. J9o is borderline for a button shove against two short stacks, but it might be profitable.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 7.8 BB, which is short but not desperate. The two opponents have even shorter stacks. I want to accumulate chips, but also preserve my stack.\n\nIf I fold, I still have 7.8 BB, which is playable. If I raise/shove and get called by one of the short stacks, I'm likely racing against a random hand. J9o vs a random hand is about 40-45% equity.\n\nThe pot is 48, and if I shove for 250, SB would need to call 101 more (117 total - 16 already in) to win 298 (48 + 250). That's about 2.95:1 pot odds, needing ~25% equity. BB would need to call 218 more (250 total - 32 already in) to win 298, getting about 1.37:1, needing ~42% equity.\n\nActually, let me calculate properly: If I shove for 250:\n- SB has 117 total, already put 16, so needs to call 101 more\n- BB has 108 total, already put 32, so needs to call 76 more\n- Pot would be: 48 (current) + 250 (my shove) = 298\n- SB calling odds: 101 to win 298 = ~2.95:1 = needs ~25% equity\n- BB calling odds: 76 to win 298 = ~3.92:1 = needs ~20% equity\n\nBoth would have good pot odds to call with any two cards. So they might call light.\n\nBut actually, with their stack sizes, they might just shove over any raise anyway.\n\nGiven J9o is not a great hand, and both opponents are short and could call/shove with a wide range, I think folding is reasonable. I have position, but the hand is weak. I'd rather wait for a better spot with 7.8 BB.\n\nHowever, I'm on the button against two very short stacks who fold a lot preflop. Maybe a raise could take it down preflop. A min-raise to 64 might get folds from both.\n\nLet me check: If I raise to 64 (putting in 32 more), SB would need to call 48 more (to get to 64 total from their 16) with 53 left behind. BB would need to call 32 more (to get to 64 total from their 32"

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the button with J9o, stack is 250 chips (7.8 BB). Blinds are 16/32. SB (Seat 5) has 117 chips (3.7 BB), BB (Seat 1) has 108 chips (3.4 BB). Both opponents have very short stacks.\n\nMy hand: J9o is not a great hand, but I'm on the button with two very short-stacked opponents. The SB only has 3.7 BB, and BB has 3.4 BB. They're both in push/fold territory.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B, SB): Has shown some aggression postflop (bet on turn hand 77, bet on flop hand 79), but has folded preflop several times. Has a very short stack.\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking, BB): Has folded preflop a lot (6 of last 10 actions are preflop folds). Only called once preflop in hand 78. Also very short stacked.\n\nMy position is excellent - I'm on the button. With both opponents having stacks under 4 BB, they're likely to shove with any decent hand or fold. \n\nPot odds: I need to call 32 to win 48 (current pot) + 16 (SB's remaining chips if they call) + possibly BB's 108 if they call. Actually, let's think: SB already posted 16, BB posted 32. If I call 32, pot becomes 80. SB has 101 left (117-16), BB has 76 left (108-32). They could potentially shove.\n\nBut actually, if I just call, SB could shove, BB could shove. With J9o, I don't want to play a multi-way pot out of position.\n\nGiven the stack sizes, I should consider raising. I have 250 chips, min raise is to 64 (putting in 32 more). But with such short stacks, a small raise might not accomplish much - they could still shove over the top.\n\nAlternatively, I could shove myself. I have 7.8 BB, which is in the push/fold range. J9o is borderline for a button shove against two short stacks, but it might be profitable.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 7.8 BB, which is short but not desperate. The two opponents have even shorter stacks. I want to accumulate chips, but also preserve my stack.\n\nIf I fold, I still have 7.8 BB, which is playable. If I raise/shove and get called by one of the short stacks, I'm likely racing against a random hand. J9o vs a random hand is about 40-45% equity.\n\nThe pot is 48, and if I shove for 250, SB would need to call 101 more (117 total - 16 already in) to win 298 (48 + 250). That's about 2.95:1 pot odds, needing ~25% equity. BB would need to call 218 more (250 total - 32 already in) to win 298, getting about 1.37:1, needing ~42% equity.\n\nActually, let me calculate properly: If I shove for 250:\n- SB has 117 total, already put 16, so needs to call 101 more\n- BB has 108 total, already put 32, so needs to call 76 more\n- Pot would be: 48 (current) + 250 (my shove) = 298\n- SB calling odds: 101 to win 298 = ~2.95:1 = needs ~25% equity\n- BB calling odds: 76 to win 298 = ~3.92:1 = needs ~20% equity\n\nBoth would have good pot odds to call with any two cards. So they might call light.\n\nBut actually, with their stack sizes, they might just shove over any raise anyway.\n\nGiven J9o is not a great hand, and both opponents are short and could call/shove with a wide range, I think folding is reasonable. I have position, but the hand is weak. I'd rather wait for a better spot with 7.8 BB.\n\nHowever, I'm on the button against two very short stacks who fold a lot preflop. Maybe a raise could take it down preflop. A min-raise to 64 might get folds from both.\n\nLet me check: If I raise to 64 (putting in 32 more), SB would need to call 48 more (to get to 64 total from their 16) with 53 left behind. BB would need to call 32 more (to get to 64 total from their 32",

            "reasoning_content": "Looking at the data: Both opponents fold preflop a lot. Seat 5 (SB) has folded preflop 8 out of 10 recent hands, only called once and checked twice (when already in blind). Seat 1 (BB) has folded preflop 9 out of 10 recent hands, only called once.\n\nWith J9o on the button against two opponents who fold constantly, a raise could take down the pot preflop. Both have very short stacks (3.7 BB and 3.4 BB) and are likely to fold unless they have a premium hand.\n\nIf I raise to 64 (min-raise), that's 2 BB. SB would need to call 48 more with only 53 behind - essentially committing their stack. BB would need to call 32 more with 76 behind. They might fold most hands.\n\nEven if they shove, J9o has decent equity against random hands. But given their folding tendencies, they'll likely fold.\n\nMy stack is 7.8 BB. Stealing the blinds (48 chips) would increase my stack by ~19%. That's significant.\n\nI think a raise is good here. A min-raise to 64 might work, but a slightly larger raise might be better. Let me think: If I raise to 80 (2.5 BB), that's still reasonable.\n\nActually, with their stack sizes, they might shove over any raise. But given their folding frequency, I think it's worth trying to steal.\n\nI'll raise to 80 (putting in 48 more). This is a 2.5 BB raise from the button. If they fold, I win 48 chips. If they shove, I have to decide whether to call. With J9o, I might fold to a shove unless I get good odds.\n\nBut actually, if SB shoves for 117 total, I'd need to call 37 more (80 to 117) to win pot of 48 + 117 + 32 = 197? Wait, let me calculate: Current pot 48, my raise to 80, SB shoves to 117. I'd need to call 37 more to win 48 + 117 + 32 = 197? Actually BB's 32 is already in the pot. So pot would be 48 + 117 = 165? I need to think more carefully.\n\nActually simpler: If I raise to 80 and SB shoves to 117, I'd need to call 37 more. Total pot would be: 48 (current) + 117 (SB) + 37 (my additional) = 202. I'm getting 202:37 \u2248 5.46:1 odds, needing only ~15% equity. With J9o, I have at least 30% equity against most hands, so I should call.\n\nBut wait, BB could also shove. If both shove, it gets complicated.\n\nGiven the opponents' folding tendencies and my position, I think raising is correct. I'll raise to 80.",

So this must be an all-in situation. The pot is 240 chips (BB 32 + my 80 + their 5 chips all-in = 117, wait that doesn't add up...)\n\nLet me reconstruct:\n- SB (Seat 5): posted 16\n- BB (Seat 1): posted 32  \n- I raised to 80\n- Seat 5 \"raised\" to 128 but only has 5 chips total\n- BB folded\n\nSo pot should be: SB 16 + BB 32 + my 80 + Seat 5's 5 = 133 chips? But it says pot is 240 chips. Maybe there are antes or something.\n\nActually, the key insight: Seat 5 only has 5 chips total, so their \"raise to 128\" is actually just going all-in for their remaining chips (5 total). So I'm effectively heads-up against a player with only 5 chips.\n\n**Pot odds**: \n- I need to call 48 chips\n- Total pot after my call: 240 + 48 = 288 chips\n- Pot odds: 48/288 = 16.7%\n- I need >16.7% equity to call\n\n**Hand analysis**: 9\u2666 J\u2663 is a marginal hand, but against a player with only 5 chips who's desperate, they could be shoving with any two cards. \n\n**Tournament situation**: I have 5.3 BB, which is very short-stacked. Seat 5 has only 5 chips (0.16 BB) and is essentially dead. This is a great spot to potentially eliminate a player and increase my stack.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, Seat 5 has been folding a lot preflop (11 folds in 20 actions), but has shown some aggression when they do play (raises, bets). With only 5 chips, they're likely shoving with a wide range.\n\n**Decision**: \n- Fold: I preserve 90 chips (80 already in pot) but give up chance to win 240 pot\n- Call: Risk 48 more chips to win 240 pot (5:1 odds)\n\nWith 9\u2666 J\u2663, I have ~40% equity against a random hand. Against a top 50% range, I have ~47% equity. The pot odds are excellent (16.7% needed, I have ~40%+).\n\n**Stack considerations**: If I lose, I'm down to 42 chips (1.3 BB).

So this must be an all-in situation. The pot is 240 chips (BB 32 + my 80 + their 5 chips all-in = 117, wait that doesn't add up...)\n\nLet me reconstruct:\n- SB (Seat 5): posted 16\n- BB (Seat 1): posted 32  \n- I raised to 80\n- Seat 5 \"raised\" to 128 but only has 5 chips total\n- BB folded\n\nSo pot should be: SB 16 + BB 32 + my 80 + Seat 5's 5 = 133 chips? But it says pot is 240 chips. Maybe there are antes or something.\n\nActually, the key insight: Seat 5 only has 5 chips total, so their \"raise to 128\" is actually just going all-in for their remaining chips (5 total). So I'm effectively heads-up against a player with only 5 chips.\n\n**Pot odds**: \n- I need to call 48 chips\n- Total pot after my call: 240 + 48 = 288 chips\n- Pot odds: 48/288 = 16.7%\n- I need >16.7% equity to call\n\n**Hand analysis**: 9\u2666 J\u2663 is a marginal hand, but against a player with only 5 chips who's desperate, they could be shoving with any two cards. \n\n**Tournament situation**: I have 5.3 BB, which is very short-stacked. Seat 5 has only 5 chips (0.16 BB) and is essentially dead. This is a great spot to potentially eliminate a player and increase my stack.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, Seat 5 has been folding a lot preflop (11 folds in 20 actions), but has shown some aggression when they do play (raises, bets). With only 5 chips, they're likely shoving with a wide range.\n\n**Decision**: \n- Fold: I preserve 90 chips (80 already in pot) but give up chance to win 240 pot\n- Call: Risk 48 more chips to win 240 pot (5:1 odds)\n\nWith 9\u2666 J\u2663, I have ~40% equity against a random hand. Against a top 50% range, I have ~47% equity. The pot odds are excellent (16.7% needed, I have ~40%+).\n\n**Stack considerations**: If I lose, I'm down to 42 chips (1.3 BB). If I win, I have 170 + 240 = 410 chips? Wait no: If I win, I get the 240 pot, but I've already put in 128. So my stack would be 170 - 128 + 240 = 282 chips (8.8 BB). Much better position.\n\nActually, let me think: Current pot is 240. If I call and win, I get back my 128 + the 240 pot = 368 total? No, the pot includes my 80 already. Let me calculate properly:\n\nCurrent pot before my decision: 240\nMy chips already in: 80\nIf I call additional: 48 (total 128 invested)\nTotal pot if I call: 240 + 48 = 288\nIf I win: I get 288, net gain = 288 - 128 = 160\nNew stack = 170 + 160 = 330 chips\n\nIf I fold: I lose 80 already in, stack = 90 chips\n\nSo risk",

Now the flop is 2s 2h Jh. I have middle pair with jack kicker. Seat 5 checked. They have only 5 chips left (they're all-in preflop? Wait, they have 5 chips total? Let's see: Seat 5 is GPT-OSS-120B with 5 chips. They posted SB 16, then raised to 128 total. That's all-in? Actually, they started with 5 chips? The stack says 5 chips. They posted SB 16, but they only have 5 chips? That seems odd: maybe they had 5 chips after posting? Or the stack display is current stack. Let's calculate: They posted SB 16, then raised to 128 total. That would require 112 more (128 total - 16 already posted). But they only have 5 chips left, so they're effectively all-in.

Let's examine: preflop actions: Seat 5 post_sb 16, Seat 1 post_bb 32, Seat 2 fold, Seat 3 raise 80, Seat 5 raise 128, Seat 1 fold, Seat 3 call 48. So Seat 5 raised to 128 total. That means they put in 128 total. They already had 16 in as SB, so they added 112 more. But they have only 5 chips left, meaning they started with maybe 133 chips? Wait, they have 5 chips now. So they have 5 chips left after the raise. That means they're not all-in yet; they still have 5 chips behind. The pot is 288 chips. The flop: Seat 5 checked. They have 5 chips left. I have 122 chips (3.8BB). The board is paired with 2s 2h Jh. I have middle pair with J9. My opponent checked. They could have a wide range: they raised from SB after my raise. They have only 5 chips left, so they're essentially committed. They might have a strong hand like AJ, KJ, QJ, TT, 99, etc., or maybe a pocket pair, or maybe a bluff. Since they have only 5 chips left, they might check hoping I bet and they can go all-in with any hand. I should consider betting to get value from worse hands like lower pairs, draws, or maybe they have ace-high. But with only 5 chips behind, if I bet, they'll likely call with any piece. I have to decide whether to check or bet. If I bet, I can bet small like 5 chips (their remaining stack) or maybe more. But the minimum raise is 48, but I can bet any amount? Actually, since they checked, I can bet any amount from 1 chip up to my stack. The minimum bet is 1 chip? In no-limit, you can bet any amount at least the size of the big blind? Usually minimum bet is the big blind (32). But the game might allow any bet. The interface says \"Minimum raise to: 48\". That's for raising after a bet. Since there's no bet, I can bet any amount. But I should consider that they have only 5 chips left, so if I bet 5, they call with anything. If I bet more, they'll be all-in.

Since they have so few chips, I should bet now to get value. I can bet 5 chips (their remaining stack) or maybe more. But betting more than 5 would be effectively betting them all-in. However, the minimum raise is 48 if I want to raise, but I'm not raising; I'm betting. I can bet any amount. I think betting 5 chips is fine: it's a small bet relative to pot (288), but it's all they have. They'll call with almost anything. If they have a better hand, I lose only 5 more chips. If they have worse, I gain 5 chips.\n\nAlternatively, I could check and see the turn, hoping to improve to two pair or trips. But with only 5 chips behind, I'm not worried about losing a big pot. I think betting is better.\n\nLet me consider tournament implications: I have 122 chips (3.8BB). That's very short. I need to accumulate chips. Winning this pot would give me 288 + 5 = 293 chips if they call, or 288 if they fold. That would double my stack. So I should try to win the pot. My hand is decent: middle pair. I should bet for value.\n\nI'll bet 5 chips (their remaining stack). That's a small bet, but it's all they have. They'll call with any piece. If they fold, I win 288. That's fine too.\n\nThus, I should raise to 5? Wait, I need to use \"raise\" action with raise_to amount. But I'm not raising; I'm betting. Since they checked, I can check or raise. Actually, legal actions are fold, check, raise. I cannot \"bet\" as an action; I need to raise. But raising requires raising to at least the minimum raise amount (48). However, I can raise to any amount at least 48? Or I can just bet by raising to some amount? The interface says \"Minimum raise to: 48\". That means if I want to raise, I must raise to at least 48 total. But I only want to bet 5. That's not allowed as a raise. So I cannot bet 5; I must either check or raise to at least 48. Wait, but in no-limit, you can bet any amount after a check. The interface might be restricting because maybe there's a rule that the minimum bet is the big blind (32). Actually, the minimum bet is usually the big blind. But the minimum raise is 48 (big blind is 32, so minimum raise is 32 more? Actually, minimum raise is typically the size of the previous bet or big blind, whichever is larger. Since there was no bet, the minimum bet is the big blind (32). But the interface says \"Minimum raise to: 48\". That's confusing. Maybe they consider the previous bet size? The previous street preflop had a raise to 128, but that's preflop. On flop, there's no bet yet. The minimum bet should be 32 (big blind). But the interface says minimum raise to 48. That might be a mistake. Let me think: In no-limit, after a check, you can bet any amount at least the minimum bet (usually big blind). So I should be able to bet 32. But the interface only gives options fold, check, raise. It doesn't have \"bet\". So maybe"

But raising requires raising to at least the minimum raise amount (48). However, I could raise to 48 total. That means I'd be putting in 48 chips. But I only have 122 chips. That's a significant portion of my stack. Is that wise? The pot is 288. If I raise to 48, that's a bet of 48 into 288 (about 1/6 pot). That's a small bet. But the minimum raise is 48, meaning I must raise to at least 48 total. Wait, \"raise_to\" is the total amount I'm putting in. Currently, I have 0 in the pot this street. So if I raise to 48, I'm putting 48 chips in. That's a bet of 48. That's allowed. But is that a good idea? My opponent has only 5 chips left. If I raise to 48, they can only call 5 more (since they have 5 behind). So they'll call 5. So effectively, I'm betting 48 to win 288 + 5 = 293, but they only have to call 5. So my bet of 48 is mostly going into the pot as dead money if they call only 5. Actually, if I raise to 48, they can call 5 (all-in). The pot would be 288 + 48 + 5 = 341. I'd have invested 48. That's okay. But I could also check. Let's evaluate: If I check, they might bet 5 on the turn. Or they might check again. If they bet 5 on the turn, I can call 5. That's fine. But checking might allow them to see a free card that could improve their hand. Since they have only 5 chips, the implied odds are negligible. I think betting is better to get value now. But I must raise to at least 48. That's a big bet relative to my stack (48 out of 122, about 40%). However, the pot is large (288). If I bet 48, I'm committing a lot. But if they have a better hand, I could lose 48 chips. But I have middle pair, which is decent. I think betting is okay. Alternatively, I could check and hope to improve. But with only 5 chips behind, I'm not worried about losing a big pot. Actually, if I check and they have a better hand, they might bet 5 on the turn, and I'd call 5. That's only 5 chips. If I bet 48 now and they have a better hand, I lose 48. That's worse. So maybe checking is safer. But if they have a worse hand, betting gets value. They might call with ace-high or lower pair. They have only 5 chips, so they'll call with almost anything. So betting 48 to win 5 extra chips might not be worth risking 48. Wait, if they have a worse hand, they'll call 5. So I gain 5 chips. If they have a better hand, I lose 48 chips. That's a bad risk-reward: risk 48 to win 5. However, the pot already has 288. If I bet and they fold, I win 288. That's good. But will they fold? They have only 5 chips left, so they'll probably call with any piece. They might fold only if they have absolutely nothing. But they raised preflop, so they likely have something. So they'll probably call. So betting 48 likely results in them calling 5. So net: I gain 5 chips if I'm ahead, lose 48 if I'm behind. That's terrible. So checking is better. If I check, they might bet 5 on the turn, and I can call 5. That's the same as them calling 5 on flop, but I risk only 5 instead of 48. So checking seems better. But wait, if I check and they check, we see turn for free. Then on turn, if I bet, they might call 5. That's fine. But if I'm behind, I lose only 5. If I'm ahead, I gain 5. So checking seems lower risk. However, there's a chance they have a draw and improve on turn. But with only 5 chips, not a big concern. So I think check is best. Let me consider opponent tendencies. I should recall their actions. Use tool."

I think betting is better.\n\nLet me consider tournament implications: I have 122 chips (3.8BB). That's very short. I need to accumulate chips. Winning this pot would give me 288 + 5 = 293 chips if they call, or 288 if they fold. That would double my stack. So I should try to win the pot. My hand is decent: middle pair. I should bet for value.\n\nI'll bet 5 chips (their remaining stack). That's a small bet, but it's all they have. They'll call with any piece. If they fold, I win 288. That's fine too.\n\nThus, I should raise to 5? Wait, I need to use \"raise\" action with raise_to amount. But I'm not raising; I'm betting. Since they checked, I can check or raise. Actually, legal actions are fold, check, raise. I cannot \"bet\" as an action; I need to raise. But raising requires raising to at least the minimum raise amount (48). However, I can raise to any amount at least 48? Or I can just bet by raising to some amount? The interface says \"Minimum raise to: 48\". That means if I want to raise, I must raise to at least 48 total. But I only want to bet 5. That's not allowed as a raise. So I cannot bet 5; I must either check or raise to at least 48. Wait, but in no-limit, you can bet any amount after a check. The interface might be restricting because maybe there's a rule that the minimum bet is the big blind (32). Actually, the minimum bet is usually the big blind. But the minimum raise is 48 (big blind is 32, so minimum raise is 32 more? Actually, minimum raise is typically the size of the previous bet or big blind, whichever is larger. Since there was no bet, the minimum bet is the big blind (32). But the interface says \"Minimum raise to: 48\". That's confusing. Maybe they consider the previous bet size? The previous street preflop had a raise to 128, but that's preflop. On flop, there's no bet yet. The minimum bet should be 32 (big blind). But the interface says minimum raise to 48. That might be a mistake. Let me think: In no-limit, after a check, you can bet any amount at least the minimum bet (usually big blind). So I should be able to bet 32. But the interface only gives options fold, check, raise. It doesn't have \"bet\". So maybe",

But raising requires raising to at least the minimum raise amount (48). However, I could raise to 48 total. That means I'd be putting in 48 chips. But I only have 122 chips. That's a significant portion of my stack. Is that wise? The pot is 288. If I raise to 48, that's a bet of 48 into 288 (about 1/6 pot). That's a small bet. But the minimum raise is 48, meaning I must raise to at least 48 total. Wait, \"raise_to\" is the total amount I'm putting in. Currently, I have 0 in the pot this street. So if I raise to 48, I'm putting 48 chips in. That's a bet of 48. That's allowed. But is that a good idea? My opponent has only 5 chips left. If I raise to 48, they can only call 5 more (since they have 5 behind). So they'll call 5. So effectively, I'm betting 48 to win 288 + 5 = 293, but they only have to call 5. So my bet of 48 is mostly going into the pot as dead money if they call only 5. Actually, if I raise to 48, they can call 5 (all-in). The pot would be 288 + 48 + 5 = 341. I'd have invested 48. That's okay. But I could also check. Let's evaluate: If I check, they might bet 5 on the turn. Or they might check again. If they bet 5 on the turn, I can call 5. That's fine. But checking might allow them to see a free card that could improve their hand. Since they have only 5 chips, the implied odds are negligible. I think betting is better to get value now. But I must raise to at least 48. That's a big bet relative to my stack (48 out of 122, about 40%). However, the pot is large (288). If I bet 48, I'm committing a lot. But if they have a better hand, I could lose 48 chips. But I have middle pair, which is decent. I think betting is okay. Alternatively, I could check and hope to improve. But with only 5 chips behind, I'm not worried about losing a big pot. Actually, if I check and they have a better hand, they might bet 5 on the turn, and I'd call 5. That's only 5 chips. If I bet 48 now and they have a better hand, I lose 48. That's worse. So maybe checking is safer. But if they have a worse hand, betting gets value. They might call with ace-high or lower pair. They have only 5 chips, so they'll call with almost anything. So betting 48 to win 5 extra chips might not be worth risking 48. Wait, if they have a worse hand, they'll call 5. So I gain 5 chips. If they have a better hand, I lose 48 chips. That's a bad risk-reward: risk 48 to win 5. However, the pot already has 288. If I bet and they fold, I win 288. That's good. But will they fold? They have only 5 chips left, so they'll probably call with any piece. They might fold only if they have absolutely nothing. But they raised preflop, so they likely have something. So they'll probably call. So betting 48 likely results in them calling 5. So net: I gain 5 chips if I'm ahead, lose 48 if I'm behind. That's terrible. So checking is better. If I check, they might bet 5 on the turn, and I can call 5. That's the same as them calling 5 on flop, but I risk only 5 instead of 48. So checking seems better. But wait, if I check and they check, we see turn for free. Then on turn, if I bet, they might call 5. That's fine. But if I'm behind, I lose only 5. If I'm ahead, I gain 5. So checking seems lower risk. However, there's a chance they have a draw and improve on turn. But with only 5 chips, not a big concern. So I think check is best. Let me consider opponent tendencies.

Opponent GPT-OSS-120B has only 5 chips left (they're essentially all-in preflop with 5 chips total? Wait, they have 5 chips total, but they raised preflop to 128? Let me check the action: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted SB 16, then raised to 128 preflop, then I called. They have 5 chips total, so they're basically all-in preflop? Actually, they have 5 chips, but they raised to 128? That seems impossible unless they're all-in. Let me think: SB is 16, BB is 32. I raised to 80 preflop. Then Seat 5 raised to 128 total. That means they put in 128 total, but they only have 5 chips? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe they had more chips earlier? Let me re-read: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 5 chips\". So currently they have 5 chips. But preflop they raised to 128. That would require them to have at least 128 chips. Maybe they lost chips on previous streets? But we're at turn, and they checked. Pot is 288 chips. Let me trace the betting: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. I raise to 80. Seat 5 raises to 128 total (so they put in 112 more? Actually SB already posted 16, so they need to add 112 to make total 128). But they only have 5 chips now. Something is off. Maybe the 5 chips is their remaining stack after the preflop action? But they raised to 128, which would be more than 5. Unless they were all-in for less. Let me check: They posted SB 16, then raised to 128 total. If they only had 5 chips total, they couldn't raise to 128. So maybe the 5 chips is a mistake, or they have 5 chips left after the raise? Actually, if they had 5 chips total, they'd be all-in for 5 chips, not 128. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the pot size: Pot is 288 chips. Preflop: SB 16, BB 32, I raise to 80, Seat 5 raises to 128, BB folds, I call additional 48. So total preflop: My 80 + Seat 5's 128 + BB's 32 = 240? Wait, SB 16, BB 32, my 80, Seat 5's 128 total. But Seat 5's 128 includes their SB 16, so they added 112. So pot: 16 (SB) + 32 (BB) + 80 (my raise) + 112 (Seat 5's additional) = 240. Then I call additional 48 (to match 128 total), so pot becomes 288. Yes, that matches. So Seat 5 put in 128 total. If they have 5 chips now, they must have had more chips preflop and lost some? But we're at turn, no further betting. They checked turn. So they still have 5 chips. That means they had at least 128 chips preflop, and now have 5 chips left. That suggests they're very short stacked.\n\nAnyway, the key point: I have middle pair weak kicker. Board is 2s 2h Jh 5c. There's a paired board with my jack. Opponent checked both flop and turn. They have only 5 chips left. I have 122 chips (3.8 BB). Pot is 288 chips. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nI should consider opponent's likely range. They raised preflop from SB after my raise. They have only 5 chips left, so they're desperate. Their range could be wide. They checked flop and turn, suggesting weakness. Maybe they have a pocket pair below jack, or ace-high, or maybe a draw. With only 5 chips left, they might be planning to check-call any bet.\n\nI have middle pair, but kicker is weak. There's a chance they have a better jack (AJ, KJ, QJ, JT) or a pocket pair above jack (QQ-AA). But they checked twice, which suggests they don't have a strong hand. However, they could be trapping with a monster like JJ, 22, or 55 (though 55 is less likely"

I have 122 chips (3.8 BB). \n\nOpponent raised preflop from SB after my raise, then checked flop and turn. With only 5 chips left, they're desperate. Their range is wide: any pair, any ace, any broadway cards. They might have a better jack (AJ, KJ, QJ, JT) but would they check twice with top pair? Possibly if they're scared of the paired board. They might have a pocket pair below jack (TT-66) and be scared of overcards. They might have ace-high or a draw.\n\nGiven they have only 5 chips, they'll likely call any bet. So if I bet, I'm risking chips to win 288. But if I'm behind, I lose. If I check, we see a river for free. \n\nWhat's my equity? Against a random hand, I'm probably ahead. But against a range of hands that would raise preflop from SB: pairs 22-AA, suited connectors, broadway cards. I'm ahead of many of those: lower pairs, ace-high, draws. I'm behind to better jacks, overpairs, and trips.\n\nBut they checked twice. That suggests weakness. Strong hands might bet for value. So they likely don't have trips or a strong overpair. They might have a medium pocket pair (TT-66) or ace-high.\n\nI should consider betting for value. I can bet small to get called by worse hands. With only 5 chips left for opponent, any bet essentially puts them all-in. Minimum raise is 48, but I could bet less if I just bet? Wait, \"raise_to\" is the total amount. Actually, I can check or raise. If I raise, minimum is 48 total? Let me check: \"Minimum raise to: 48\". That means if I raise, I need to raise to at least 48 total. But the pot is 288, amount to call is 0. So a minimum bet would be 48? Actually in no-limit, you can bet any amount from minimum bet (usually big blind) up to all-in. Minimum raise is 48, meaning if I want to raise (bet), I need to put in at least 48 total. But I could also just check.\n\nGiven opponent has only 5 chips, even a small bet of like 16 would put them all-in (they have 5 chips, so they can only call up to 5). Actually, they have 5 chips total, so any bet above 5, they can only call 5. So if I bet 48, they call 5 (all they have). So effectively, I'm risking 48 to win 293 (288 + 5). But actually, if I bet 48 and they call 5, pot becomes 288 + 48 + 5 = 341. I invest 48 to potentially win 293? Wait, pot is 288 now. If I bet 48 and they call 5, total pot = 288 + 48 + 5 = 341. I contributed 48, so net gain if I win = 341 - 48 = 293. Yes.\n\nBut if I check, we see river for free, and then they might bet their last 5 on river if they improve or try to bluff. Or check again.\n\nI have 122 chips total. Betting 48 is about 40% of my stack. That's significant. But pot is huge relative to stacks. \n\nI think betting for value is good. I likely have the best hand. Opponent checked twice, showing weakness. They have only 5 chips, so they'll call with any pair or draw. I should bet small to get called by worse hands. Minimum raise is 48, which is fine. I could even go all-in (122) but that might fold out worse hands. Better to bet small like 48-64 to get called.\n\nLet me check my tournament situation: I have 122 chips (3.8 BB). That's very short. I need to accumulate chips. This pot is 288, almost triple my stack. Winning this pot would give me ~410 chips (122 + 288 = 410). That would be huge. So I should try to win it.\n\nI'll bet for value. Minimum 48 is good. Let's do 48.\n\nBut wait, opponent might have a slow-played monster. Unlikely given they have"

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 9d Jc, board is 2s 2h Jh 5c. I have middle pair with weak kicker (jack with 9 kicker). My stack is 122 chips (3.8 BB). Opponent GPT-OSS-120B has only 5 chips left (they're essentially all-in preflop with 5 chips total? Wait, they have 5 chips total, but they raised preflop to 128? Let me check the action: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted SB 16, then raised to 128 preflop, then I called. They have 5 chips total, so they're basically all-in preflop? Actually, they have 5 chips, but they raised to 128? That seems impossible unless they're all-in. Let me think: SB is 16, BB is 32. I raised to 80 preflop. Then Seat 5 raised to 128 total. That means they put in 128 total, but they only have 5 chips? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe they had more chips earlier? Let me re-read: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 5 chips\". So currently they have 5 chips. But preflop they raised to 128. That would require them to have at least 128 chips. Maybe they lost chips on previous streets? But we're at turn, and they checked. Pot is 288 chips. Let me trace the betting: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. I raise to 80. Seat 5 raises to 128 total (so they put in 112 more? Actually SB already posted 16, so they need to add 112 to make total 128). But they only have 5 chips now. Something is off. Maybe the 5 chips is their remaining stack after the preflop action? But they raised to 128, which would be more than 5. Unless they were all-in for less. Let me check: They posted SB 16, then raised to 128 total. If they only had 5 chips total, they couldn't raise to 128. So maybe the 5 chips is a mistake, or they have 5 chips left after the raise? Actually, if they had 5 chips total, they'd be all-in for 5 chips, not 128. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about the pot size: Pot is 288 chips. Preflop: SB 16, BB 32, I raise to 80, Seat 5 raises to 128, BB folds, I call additional 48. So total preflop: My 80 + Seat 5's 128 + BB's 32 = 240? Wait, SB 16, BB 32, my 80, Seat 5's 128 total. But Seat 5's 128 includes their SB 16, so they added 112. So pot: 16 (SB) + 32 (BB) + 80 (my raise) + 112 (Seat 5's additional) = 240. Then I call additional 48 (to match 128 total), so pot becomes 288. Yes, that matches. So Seat 5 put in 128 total. If they have 5 chips now, they must have had more chips preflop and lost some? But we're at turn, no further betting. They checked turn. So they still have 5 chips. That means they had at least 128 chips preflop, and now have 5 chips left. That suggests they're very short stacked.\n\nAnyway, the key point: I have middle pair weak kicker. Board is 2s 2h Jh 5c. There's a paired board with my jack. Opponent checked both flop and turn. They have only 5 chips left. I have 122 chips (3.8 BB). Pot is 288 chips. Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\nI should consider opponent's likely range. They raised preflop from SB after my raise. They have only 5 chips left, so they're desperate. Their range could be wide. They checked flop and turn, suggesting weakness. Maybe they have a pocket pair below jack, or ace-high, or maybe a draw. With only 5 chips left, they might be planning to check-call any bet.\n\nI have middle pair, but kicker is weak. There's a chance they have a better jack (AJ, KJ, QJ, JT) or a pocket pair above jack (QQ-AA). But they checked twice, which suggests they don't have a strong hand. However, they could be trapping with a monster like JJ, 22, or 55 (though 55 is less likely",

Board is paired deuces, so there are trips possible but unlikely. Opponent has only 5 chips left, so they're essentially all-in for any bet. Pot is 288 chips. I have 122 chips (3.8 BB). \n\nOpponent raised preflop from SB after my raise, then checked flop and turn. With only 5 chips left, they're desperate. Their range is wide: any pair, any ace, any broadway cards. They might have a better jack (AJ, KJ, QJ, JT) but would they check twice with top pair? Possibly if they're scared of the paired board. They might have a pocket pair below jack (TT-66) and be scared of overcards. They might have ace-high or a draw.\n\nGiven they have only 5 chips, they'll likely call any bet. So if I bet, I'm risking chips to win 288. But if I'm behind, I lose. If I check, we see a river for free. \n\nWhat's my equity? Against a random hand, I'm probably ahead. But against a range of hands that would raise preflop from SB: pairs 22-AA, suited connectors, broadway cards. I'm ahead of many of those: lower pairs, ace-high, draws. I'm behind to better jacks, overpairs, and trips.\n\nBut they checked twice. That suggests weakness. Strong hands might bet for value. So they likely don't have trips or a strong overpair.

            "reasoning_content": "We have SB with pocket pair 2s, stack 117 chips (3.7 BB). Blinds 16/32. Already posted 16 SB, BB posted 32. Pot 128 (includes both blinds). Opponent (Seat 3) raised to 80, which is 48 over BB? Actually raise amount: they put 80 total, so they added 48 (since BB is 32). So amount to call is 64 (80-16). Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., raise by at least 48 more). Our stack is 117, after posting SB 16, we have 101 left? Actually total stack includes posted SB? Usually stack includes chips not yet posted; they posted SB 16, so remaining 101. To call 64 we need 64 chips more, leaving 37 chips. To raise to 128 total (i.e., add 48 more than call) would require 128 - 16 =112 total contribution? Wait raise_to is total amount you put in this round including previous contributions? In guidelines: \"raise_to is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\". So if we raise to 128, we need to have total contribution of 128 chips. We already posted 16, so need additional 112. Our remaining stack 101 can't cover 112, so cannot raise to 128; we could go all-in for 117 total, which is less than min raise, but maybe allowed as all-in? Rule: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So we could go all-in (117 total) which is raise to 117 (or maybe 117 total). But is that allowed? Usually you can go all-in for less than min raise, but it's considered a call? In tournament, you can go all-in for less than min raise; it's treated as a raise if it's at least call? Actually if you go all-in for less than min raise, it's a call if you cannot raise. However rule says you can go all-in if you can't afford min raise. So we could raise all-in.\n\nNow evaluate hand: 2-2 is low pocket pair. With 3.7 BB, short stack, we might consider shove (all-in) or fold. Opponent's raise size: 80 into 128 pot, that's about 2.5 BB raise (actually 80 total, so raise 48 over BB, 48/32=1.5 BB). Not huge. Opponent is DeepSeek-V3.2. Past behavior: raises varied amounts: 177, 32, 56, 64, 184. So they raise a range of sizes, sometimes small (32) sometimes large. Not sure about tightness. With short stack, we could shove with any pair? Typically with 3 BB, you can shove with any pocket pair, maybe also suited connectors. 2-2 is the weakest pair, but still a set possibility. Against a raise, shoving may be okay to try to steal blinds and maybe get called by worse or fold.\n\nConsider equity: If we call 64, we have 37 left, vulnerable to further raises? After call, we will be in the big blind with 37 chips, could be forced all-in later. Better to go all-in now to maximize chance.\n\nOpponent's stack 170 chips, about 5.3 BB. They could call or re-raise. If they re-raise, they'd risk more.\n\nGiven our short stack, typical play is to go all-in (shove) with any pocket pair. So we should raise (all-in) to 117 total (or maybe raise to 117). Legal actions include raise, we can raise to 117 (all-in). Provide reasoning.\n\nThus JSON: action \"raise\", raise_to 117, reasoning.\n\n",

Need to know legal actions. Not provided. We must infer from situation: It's our turn (BB) after opponent actions on turn? Not listed. Possibly opponent checked on turn as well? The legal actions likely are check or bet/raise? But we need to query opponent actions? However we have limited info. We can use recall_opponent_actions to see opponent's behavior on turn in similar spots. But we need current legal actions. Could be check or bet (raise). Since we have 5 chips total, very short stack (0.2 BB). Our stack is 5 chips, blinds are 16/32, so we are deep short. Pot is 288 chips, we have a set of twos (pocket pair 2c2d, board has two twos already, so we have quads! Actually board has 2s 2h, we have 2c 2d => we have quads (four of a kind). That's the nuts, unbeatable. So we should try to get maximum value. Opponent (Seat 3) has 122 chips, likely has something like maybe a straight draw? Board: 2s 2h Jh 5c. Potential draws: maybe 9-10 for straight? Not likely. Opponent could have Jx for trips, but they'd have at least a set of Jacks. But we have quads, they could have Jacks, but they'd have three Jacks (Jx with board J). That's weaker. So we want to bet/raise to get value. However we have only 5 chips left; opponent's stack 122 chips. Minimum raise to 48 (from flop) but that's preflop? Actually minimum raise to 48 is from flop stage. But on turn, min bet is maybe 48? Not sure. Our stack 5 chips, we cannot meet min raise of 48, so we can go all-in for 5 chips. That's allowed (all-in). Legal actions likely include raise (all-in) or check. We should bet all-in to extract value. Opponent may call.\n\nThus action: raise to 5 (all-in). Reasoning: we have quads, unbeatable, need value, short stack.\n\nWe must ensure raise_to is total amount we put in. Our stack is 5 chips, but we already posted blind 16? Actually preflop we posted 16 as SB? Wait we are BB seat 5, posted SB 16? Actually blinds: 16/32, seat5 is BB, but actions show \"post_sb 16\" for seat5 preflop. So maybe seat5 is SB not BB? Confusing. But we have 5 chips remaining after posting? Actually stack 5 chips now includes our blind posted? Not sure. But we have 5 chips left total. So all-in 5.\n\nThus JSON.\n\n",

Opponent (Seat 3) bet 48 into pot 336? Wait pot after turn before bet: preflop pot? Let's compute: preflop: blinds 16+32=48, then raise 80 from seat3 (to 80?), Actually seat3 raise 80 (meaning raise to 80? Usually raise to 80 total? He posted blind? He is in SB? Wait seat5 is BB, seat1 is BB? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? The actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 16 (so seat5 is small blind). Seat1 post_bb 32 (big blind). Seat2 fold. Seat3 raise 80. Seat5 raise 128 (so seat5 re-raises to 128). Seat1 fold. Seat3 call 48 (calls to 128). So pot after preflop: blinds 48 + raise amounts. Let's compute: seat3 raised to 80 (so added 64 extra beyond 16? Actually seat3 had no blind, so contributed 80). Then seat5 raise to 128, adding 112 beyond 16. Seat3 call 48 (to match 128). So total contributions: seat5: 16+112=128, seat1: 32, seat3: 80+48=128, seat2:0. Total pot = 128+32+80? Wait we double counted? Let's just sum contributions: seat5 128, seat1 32, seat3 128 = 288. So pot 288 pre-flop. Then flop: both check, pot still 288. Turn: both check, then seat3 bets 48. So pot before bet: 288 + 0 (no flop bets) = 288. After bet, pot becomes 336 (as given). So we are facing a bet 48 into pot 336. We have quads, unbeatable. So we should call (or raise if allowed). But legal actions: fold, call. Minimum raise to 96, but raise not in legal actions (maybe because we are short stacked? Actually we have 5 chips left, which is less than min raise 96, but we could go all-in. However legal actions only list fold, call. So we cannot raise because we cannot meet min raise, but we could go all-in? Usually if you cannot meet min raise, you can go all-in but still considered a raise? In many rules, you can go all-in for less than min raise, but it's considered a raise. However the system says legal actions: fold, call. So we cannot raise. So we must either call or fold. Obviously we call to win. Also note we have only 5 chips left, but need to call 48? Wait our stack is 5 chips (0.2 BB). So we cannot call 48 because we only have 5 chips left. That seems contradictory. Actually amount to call is 48, but we only have 5 chips left, meaning we are short stacked and cannot cover bet. In that case we are forced to go all-in for 5 chips (call all-in). The system may treat that as call (since call all-in). So we call (all-in). So action: call. Reasoning: we have quads, unbeatable, want to get max value, call all-in.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

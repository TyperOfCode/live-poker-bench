Even on the button, this is a clear fold. Let me think about why:\n\n1. Hand strength: T2o is extremely weak. The cards are not suited, not connected, and the 2 is the lowest card in the deck. This hand has very little potential to make strong hands.\n\n2. Position: While being on the button is the best position, it doesn't make up for how weak this hand is.\n\n3. Stack size: I have a healthy stack of 108.5 BB. I shouldn't risk chips with such a weak hand.\n\n4. Pot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win 3 chips, which is 1.5:1 pot odds. Even with these odds, T2o is not worth playing.\n\n5. Tournament considerations: With a healthy stack, I should be selective and wait for better spots. I don't need to gamble with T2o.\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold based on basic poker fundamentals. T2o is a fold in virtually all situations.\n\nLet me make the decision:",

The one time they raised was a big raise to 20 (Hand #11). Now they're raising to 6 from the SB, which is a 3x raise from small blind.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n7d 8s is a weak hand:\n- Off-suit, not connected (7-8)\n- Low cards\n- Not a premium hand by any means\n- However, I'm in the BB getting decent pot odds\n\n**Pot Odds Calculation:**\n- Pot before my action: 8 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 5 raise)\n- Amount to call: 4 chips\n- Pot odds: 8:4 = 2:1 = 33% equity needed\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\n- I have 210 chips (105 BB) - very deep stack\n- Opponent has 144 chips\n- Tournament is still early with deep stacks\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm out of position (BB) against SB raiser\n- This is disadvantageous postflop\n\n**Tournament Strategy:**\n- With deep stacks, I can be more selective\n- 78o is a speculative hand that needs favorable flops\n- Out of position makes it harder to realize equity\n\n**Alternative Considerations:**\n- Could 3-bet as a bluff since opponent might be stealing from SB\n- But 78o is a poor hand to 3-bet bluff with\n- Folding seems most prudent\n\nGiven:\n1. Weak hand (78o)\n2. Out of position\n3. Opponent has shown some aggression (raised once before)\n4. Pot odds are decent but position is bad\n5. Tournament deep stack play favors tighter ranges\n\nI think folding is correct. The hand is too weak to play out of position, even with decent pot odds. Better to wait for better spots.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"78o is too weak to play out of position against a SB raise.

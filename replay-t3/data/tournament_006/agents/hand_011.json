From the recall, I can see that in the previous hand (hand #10), this opponent made a raise on the flop for 8 chips. This is limited information, but it suggests they are capable of betting/raising.\n\nLet me analyze my current situation:\n- Hand: 3d Ac (offsuit, low kicker)\n- Position: BTN (good position)\n- Stack: 205 chips (102.5 BB)\n- Pot: 9 chips\n- To call: 6 chips\n- I have Ace-3 offsuit\n\nThis is a marginal hand. Let me consider:\n1. **Hand strength**: Ace-high with a weak kicker. Not a strong hand, especially offsuit.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position, but that doesn't make up for the weak hand.\n3. **Opponent**: Only one opponent has shown aggression so far (seat 5). The recall shows they raised in the previous hand on the flop, but that's not enough data to establish a pattern.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 6 to win 9, so 6:9 or 1:1.5. Not great odds for a weak hand.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (102.5 BB). I don't need to take marginal spots like this. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nAce-3 offsuit is a fold in most situations preflop, especially facing a raise. The only exception might be if the raiser is extremely loose and I have them covered, but I don't have enough information to make that determination. Folding is the disciplined play here.",

Poor position in SB with 39% pot odds requiring more equity than hand has. Better to preserve stack for stronger spots given tournament context.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 8c As (Ace-eight offsuit)\n- Position: SB (small blind)\n- My stack: 210 chips (105 BB)\n- Pot: 28 chips\n- Action: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) 3-bet to 20\n- Amount to call: 18 (from my 2 BB post)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n1. **Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):** From the recall, this opponent has mostly folded preflop (7 out of 10 hands). In hand #10, they checked BB preflop, then bet 4 on flop. This is their first 3-bet we've seen. They have 152 chips.\n\n2. **Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B):** Has folded preflop 8 out of 10 hands. Called once in BB, raised once on flop. Has 198 chips.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\nA8o is a weak hand, especially from SB facing a raise and 3-bet. The Ace is decent but the 8 kicker is poor. This hand plays poorly multi-way and out of position.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 28 chips (1+2+6+20-1? Actually: SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 6 + 3-bet 20 = 29? Wait, let me recalc: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, Seat 5 raised to 6 (so additional 4), Seat 2 raised to 20 (so additional 18 from their SB? Actually Seat 2 was SB in previous hand? No, Seat 2 posted SB 1, I posted BB 2, Seat 5 raised to 6, Seat 2 3-bet to 20. So total pot: SB 1 + BB 2 + Seat 5's 6 + Seat 2's additional 19 (20 total - 1 already posted) = 28 chips correct).\n- I need to call 18 to win 28, so pot odds: 18/(28+18) = 18/46 \u2248 39%.\n\nI need about 39% equity to call. A8o vs a 3-betting range likely has far less equity. Even against a wide range like TT+, AQo+, AJs+, KQs, I have only ~27% equity.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 210 chips (105 BB), healthy stack\n- Folding costs me only my 2 BB blind\n- Calling puts 18 chips (9% of stack) at risk with weak hand out of position\n- 3-bettor (Seat 2) has shown tight tendencies, so their 3-bet likely strong\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in SB, worst position postflop. Will have to act first on every street.\n\n**Alternative:**\nCould consider raising, but A8o doesn't play well as a 4-bet bluff. Would need to commit significant chips.\n\nGiven all factors: weak hand, poor position, facing 3-bet from tight player, poor pot odds, I should fold. Preserve stack for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there's any history of these players showing down weak hands... No showdown data in recalls. Both seem tight preflop.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Actually amount to call is 2 (big blind). Minimum raise to 4 (so raise to total 4). Need to consider opponent tendencies. We have data: opponent seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop to 6 in hand #2. That's a raise of 6 (to 6 total) which is 3x BB (since BB is 2). So they may be aggressive. But we don't know other data. We have no info on seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) or seat 1. But seat 2 is SB and we are UTG. Our hand QK offsuit (queen king unsuited). That's a decent hand, but from UTG it's strong enough to raise in many games. In tournament with 102 BB stack, we can raise to 4 (2x BB) or maybe bigger. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to total 4). That's a standard raise. Should we raise? QK offsuit is a premium-ish hand, especially UTG. Likely we want to open raise to build pot and isolate. Also consider opponent tendencies: seat 2 has raised previously, maybe they are willing to 3-bet? But we are first to act after SB and BB posted. Actually order: seat 2 is SB posted 1, seat 3 is BB posted 2, seat 4 folded, seat 5 is us UTG? Wait seat numbers: seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat 2 is Kimi-K2, seat 3 DeepSeek-V3.2, seat 4 MiniMax-M2 (folded), seat 5 us. Position UTG seat 5? Usually UTG is first after big blind, but seat numbers may be different. The order: preflop: seat 2 post_sb 1, seat 3 post_bb 2, seat 4 fold, then it's our turn (seat 5). So we are first to act after blinds. So we can raise. Raise to 4 is standard. Should we consider 3-betting? Our stack is deep (102 BB), but typical open raise is 2.5-3 BB. Minimum raise to 4 is 2 BB (since big blind 2). Actually 4 total = 2 BB, which is small. Could we raise to bigger? The legal actions are fold, call, raise, but raise_to we can set any amount >= minimum raise. Probably we can raise more. Should we raise to maybe 6 or 8? Considering seat 2 may be aggressive, but we can open raise to 6 to isolate and protect. However we might want to keep pot manageable. QK offsuit is a strong hand, but from UTG we should be careful. I think raise to 6 (3 BB) is good. But we need to ensure we have enough chips; we have 204, so fine.\n\nWe also have seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) still to act after us? Actually after our action, seat 1 will act (since they are on left of us). They have 205 chips. They may call or raise. So we need to set raise amount that is appropriate. I'd raise to 6.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 6, reasoning: hand strength, position, tournament, etc.\n\n",

In BB facing a raise from UTG (likely early position) to 20 (10x big blind). That's a 10bb raise. Stack sizes moderate. We have 99 BB stack, deep. QK offsuit? Actually Qd Ks is offsuit (Qd and Ks). That's a decent hand but not a top 10. Usually you would fold to 10bb raise from early position with QK offsuit? Many players would call or 3-bet depending on dynamics. In tournament with 99 BB, you can be a bit aggressive. But we are out of position post-flop. Also the raise is from seat2 (likely UTG). Our position is BB, we are out of position. QK off is a good hand to 3-bet for value and to take initiative. But we need to consider opponent's range: early position raise could be strong: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT, AK, maybe AQ, maybe AJs, maybe KQs, maybe suited connectors. QK off is in that range as a call maybe but also a 3-bet candidate.\n\nWe have 198 chips, opponent 152 chips. So we could 3-bet to 34 (minimum raise). That would be 34 total, meaning we add 28 more chips (since we have 6 already). That would be a raise of 34 total (i.e., 34-20 = 14 extra? Actually minimum raise to 34 means total bet of 34, so we need to put 34 total, we currently have 6, need to add 28. So raise amount = 28 chips more, total 34). That's a 17bb raise (since 34/2). That's a decent size.\n\nAlternatively we could call 14 to see flop. But QK off vs early raise is maybe +EV to call? Let's compute pot odds: pot currently 28 (including blinds and our raise) + opponent's raise 20 (so pot after they raise = 28 + 20? Actually the pot before decision includes all bets: SB 1, BB 2, our raise to 6, opponent raise to 20. So total pot = 1+2+6+20 = 29? Wait we need to sum: SB 1, BB 2, our raise to 6 (so we contributed 6 total, not additional 4?), opponent raise to 20 (so they contributed 20). So total = 1+2+6+20 = 29. But the problem statement says pot: 28 chips. Slight discrepancy maybe they count differently. Anyway pot about 28. If we call 14, pot becomes ~42. So we would be calling 14 into pot 28 => 2:1 odds. So we need to have >33% equity. QK offsuit vs early raise range maybe ~30%? Might be borderline. So a call could be okay if we think we have equity. But raising could also be good to take initiative and maybe win pot preflop.\n\nGiven we have deep stack, we might want to 3-bet to isolate and take control. But we need to consider opponent's tendencies: we have only one prior raise of 6 (small) from them, not informative. Could be a loose player. In early position, small raise 6 (3bb) maybe indicates a wide range. If they raise to 20 now (10bb) maybe they are strong. Actually that is the raise we are facing. So we can't gauge.\n\nGiven tournament stage unknown, but we have decent stack. I think best action: raise to minimum 34 to 3-bet. Reason: QK offsuit is strong enough to 3"

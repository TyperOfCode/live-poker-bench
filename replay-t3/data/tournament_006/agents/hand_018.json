This is a very weak hand:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 4-7 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. It's not connected, not suited, and both cards are low.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (Under the Gun), which is the worst position preflop. I have to act first on all postflop streets.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have a healthy stack of 108.5 BB, so I can afford to fold marginal hands.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: Early in tournaments, the goal is to preserve my stack and wait for better spots. Playing garbage hands from early position is a recipe for disaster.\n\nEven though it's only 2 chips to call (1% of my stack), the problem is:\n- I'll be out of position postflop\n- I have no hand equity\n- Even if I hit something (like a pair of 7s or 4s), I'll likely be dominated\n- This hand has almost no potential to make strong hands\n\nThe correct play is to fold this hand preflop from UTG position.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation. I'm on the button with A6o. The blinds are 1/2, and I have 209 chips (104.5 BB). Two players have already folded. The small blind (MiniMax-M2) posted 1 chip, and the big blind (GPT-OSS-120B) posted 2 chips. I need to call 2 chips to see the flop.\n\nFrom my research:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB) seems to play fairly tight. They've folded most hands preflop, called a few times, and made some small bets post-flop. They've shown some aggression with river bets.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB) has shown some aggression with raises preflop (hand 11 raised to 6, hand 15 raised to 6). They also 3-bet in hand 11 (raised to 34 after a raise to 20). They seem capable of aggressive plays.\n\nMy hand A6o is marginal but playable from the button. The button is a great position - I get to act last on all future streets. With two players left (SB and BB), I have position on both.\n\nStack sizes: I have 209, SB has 202, BB has 214. We're all deep (100+ BB).\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold - A6o is not great, but folding from the button with only 2 chips to call seems too tight.\n2. Call - Pay 2 chips to see a flop with position. This is reasonable.\n3. Raise - Could raise to isolate and take initiative. A6o isn't a great raising hand, but from the button against blinds, a raise could work.\n\nLooking at pot odds: Pot is 3 chips (1 SB + 2 BB). I need to call 2 chips, so pot odds are 3:2 or 1.5:1. I need ~40% equity to call. Against random hands, A6o has about 55-60% equity against one random hand, and slightly less against two. So calling has positive EV.\n\nTournament considerations: We're deep-stacked, so I don't need to take big risks. But accumulating chips is important.\n\nGiven my position on the button and the small investment required, I think calling is reasonable. Raising with A6o could get me into trouble if one of the blinds decides to play back, and I don't want to bloat the pot with a marginal hand.\n\nI'll call and see a flop with position.",

I have ace-high with a weak kicker. The board is dry with a pair of 9s and a 2. My hand has:\n- No pair (ace-high)\n- Backdoor straight potential (need 3-4-5 or 7-8-T)\n- No flush draw\n- Very weak showdown value\n\nHowever, I have position and the opponent checked. This is a classic spot for a continuation bet. Given the dry board and opponent's checking tendency, they likely don't have a 9 or strong hand. They would likely bet a 9 or overpair.\n\nPot is small (5 chips). A small bet of 2-3 chips (40-60% pot) could take it down. If called, I can reevaluate on turn.\n\nMy tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (103.5 BB). Losing a small bet here won't hurt me much. Winning the pot adds to my stack.\n\nOpponent tendencies: They seem somewhat passive postflop based on limited history. They've folded to aggression before.\n\nI should make a small bet to try to win the pot now. If raised, I can easily fold. If called, I'll need to reassess on turn.\n\nThe minimum raise is 2 (making total bet 2). That's 40% pot - reasonable. I'll make a small bet.",

Your goal is to win chips and ultimately win the tournament.\n\nYou have access to memory tools to recall information about past hands and opponent behavior. Use these tools strategically to inform your decisions.\n\nWhen you decide on an action, respond with a JSON object in this exact format:\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\" | \"check\" | \"call\" | \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": <number if raising, otherwise null>,\n  \"reasoning\": \"<brief explanation of your decision>\"\n}\n\nImportant rules:\n- Use \"check\" when there's nothing to call (amount to call is 0)\n- Use \"call\" when facing a bet you want to match\n- If raising, \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\n- You can only raise if \"raise\" is in your legal_actions\n- If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\n- Always provide reasoning for your decision\n\nThink step by step about:\n1. Your hand strength and potential\n2. Your position and stack size\n3. Opponent tendencies (use tools to recall)\n4. Pot odds and implied odds\n5. Tournament considerations (stack preservation vs. accumulation)"

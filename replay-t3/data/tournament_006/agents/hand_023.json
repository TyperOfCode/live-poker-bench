This suggests the players are playing fairly conservatively.\n\nNow, let me analyze my current situation:\n- I'm UTG (Under the Gun) which is the worst position at the table\n- I have 4d 9h which is a terrible hand - unsuited, disconnected, low cards\n- My stack is 220 chips (55 BB) which is a comfortable stack\n- I need to call 4 chips to see the flop\n- The players seem to be playing tight based on the recent history\n\nFrom UTG position, I should be playing very tight. 4-9 offsuit is well below any reasonable opening range from early position. Even if the table is playing tight, this hand has very little potential:\n- Not suited\n- Not connected (gap of 4 cards)\n- Low cards that rarely make strong hands\n- Even if I hit a pair, it will be a weak pair\n\nThe pot odds are not relevant here because the hand is just too weak. I should fold this hand and wait for a better spot, especially since I'm in the worst position at the table.\n\nThe best play is to fold.",

Both players to act after me (SB and BB) have been folding a lot recently. Seat 4 (SB/MiniMax-M2) has folded 9 of last 10 hands preflop, only called once from SB. Seat 5 (BB/GPT-OSS-120B) has folded 7 of last 10 hands preflop, raised once from BB, and checked once.\n\nThis is a great spot to raise from the button. A6o isn't a premium hand, but with both blinds showing tight tendencies, I can steal the blinds. My position is excellent - I'm on the button, so I'll have position postflop if called.\n\nStack sizes: I have 206, SB has 199, BB has 205. Standard raise would be 3x BB = 12 chips total (raise to 12). That's only 8 more chips to call the 4 BB. If I get called, I have position and can play postflop.\n\nThe pot is currently 6 chips (SB + BB). If I raise to 12, I'm risking 12 to win 6, but with fold equity. Given the tight tendencies, I expect folds most of the time.\n\nI should raise. Let me think about sizing: Minimum raise is to 8 (just doubling the BB), but that's too small - gives great odds to call. Better to raise to 12-16. I'll go with 12 (3x).\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 12,\n  \"reasoning\": \"On button with A6o against tight blinds (both folding >70% preflop).

When they do raise, it's likely they have a decent hand.\n\n3. **My Position**: I'm in the small blind, which is the worst position in poker. I'd be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n4. **Stack Considerations**: I have 199 chips (about 50 BB). While not short stacked, I need to be selective with my spots.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I'm getting about 1.8:1 pot odds (18 chips in pot vs 10 to call), but this doesn't make 6s 2s profitable to play, especially out of position against a likely strong range.\n\n6. **My History**: Looking at my recent small blind hands, I've been folding quite a bit (16 folds out of 22 hands), which is appropriate given the position disadvantage.\n\nThe decision is clear - I should fold this weak hand. 6s 2s has very little equity, especially against a likely strong raising range from an opponent who doesn't raise often. The small blind position makes it even worse since I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nFolding preserves my stack for a better spot, which is crucial in tournament play.\n",

Looking at their history, they seem fairly tight - mostly folding or calling. They raised a couple times but generally passive. They called from CO which could be a wide range but they're not super aggressive.\n   - Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) is BB with 154 chips. Looking at their history, they've been folding a lot, only raised once preflop.\n\nThe pot is 10 chips (2+4+4). I need to call 2 chips (very cheap at 0.5 BB).\n\nGiven:\n- Very cheap price (2 chips into 12 pot = 6:1 pot odds)\n- My hand has decent potential (suited, connected)\n- I'm OOP but the price is right\n- The CO caller seems passive\n- The BB is likely to check or fold to aggression\n\nThis is an easy call. The pot odds are too good to fold, and raising from SB with QTs OOP against a caller isn't ideal. I want to see a flop cheaply.\n\nI should call 2 chips.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q\u2660 T\u2660 has good potential and I'm getting 6:1 pot odds to call just 2 chips (0.5 BB).

They could have:\n- Small pocket pairs (22-88)\n- Some suited connectors\n- Maybe some broadway cards\n- Ace-high hands\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm out of position (SB) which is a disadvantage\n- I have a healthy stack of 64 BB\n- The pot is small (12 chips)\n\n**Decision:**\nI have two overcards on a dry board. Given that:\n1. The board is very dry (no draws)\n2. I have 6 outs (~24% chance to hit on turn)\n\n\n3. I'm out of position\n4. Opponent seems passive and likely to have missed this board\n5. I can represent a strong hand with a small bet\n\nA strategic probe bet could be effective. I'll make a small 8-chip bet (2/3 pot) to test opponent's strength. This sizing puts pressure on marginal hands while risking minimal chips. If they call or raise, I'm likely behind and can easily fold. The bet serves multiple purposes: gathering information, potentially taking down the pot immediately, and setting up future street decisions.",

On this board, I have:\n- No pair (Q high)\n- No flush draw (only one spade)\n- No straight draw (I need a J for a straight, but that would be Q-J-T-9-8, which isn't possible with the board cards)\n- Basically just Q high\n\n**Board texture:** 5c 9c 6d Kd\n- Two clubs, so flush draw possible\n- King on the turn - this is a scary card for many hands\n- Pretty coordinated board with potential straight draws (7-8 would make a straight)\n\n**Action history:**\n- Preflop: I called from SB, BB checked, Seat 5 called\n- Flop (5c 9c 6d): I bet 8, both opponents called\n- Turn (Kd): I checked, BB checked, Seat 5 bet 12\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively passive:\n- Folds frequently preflop\n- When they do see flops, they often check/fold\n- In hand 30, they called preflop, then checked all streets\n- They seem to be a relatively tight/passive player\n\nThe turn bet of 12 into a 48 pot is a 1/4 pot bet. This could be:\n- A value bet with a King\n- A semi-bluff with a club flush draw\n- A pure bluff\n- A weak pair trying to protect\n\n**My situation:**\n- I have absolutely nothing but Q high\n- The King is a terrible card for me - it hits many hands that would call preflop (Kx hands)\n- I c-bet the flop and got two callers, which suggests some strength\n- The turn check from me and BB, followed by a bet from Seat 5, suggests they have something\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 12 to win 60 (48+12), which is 20% equity needed. Even if my opponent is bluffing sometimes, I don't think I have enough equity with Q high.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 62 BB, which is a healthy stack. I don't need to make marginal calls here. Folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\nGiven that I have no draw, no pair, and the King is a scary card that likely helped someone, and I have two opponents who called my flop c-bet, I should fold here. The opponent who is betting the turn (GPT-OSS-120B) has shown to be relatively passive in the past, so a turn bet likely indicates some strength.\n\nMy flop c-bet was reasonable, but when I get called in two spots and the turn brings a King, I should give up with my weak hand.",

The opponents have shown weakness by just calling, but my hand is simply too weak to continue.

This is one of the worst starting hands in poker, especially from UTG position where I have to act first preflop and will face action from 4 players behind me.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding most hands from early positions, which is correct strategy. My stack is 198 chips (49.5 BB), which is healthy but not huge. The blinds are 2/4.\n\nFrom the opponent actions I can see, there was a recent hand (#34) where Kimi-K2 Thinking raised to 12 from early position (likely UTG or similar), which suggests some aggressive play. But overall, I don't have extensive data on opponent tendencies yet.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Hand strength: 3-5 offsuit is terrible. It has very low equity against random hands and minimal postflop playability.\n2. Position: UTG is the worst position. I'll be out of position for the entire hand.\n3. Stack preservation: With 49.5 BB, I should be careful not to bleed chips with weak hands.\n4. Tournament stage: Early/mid tournament with healthy stacks.\n5. Pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6 (pot is 6). That's 1.5:1 odds, but with such a weak hand, I need much better implied odds.\n\nThe correct play is clearly to fold. Playing 3-5 offsuit from UTG would be a major mistake. Even calling the BB is bad because:\n- I'll likely face raises behind me\n- If I see a flop, I'll be out of position with a weak hand\n- The hand has very little potential to make strong hands (only straights really, and even then they'd be low straights)\n- I could get into difficult spots postflop\n\nBetter to preserve my chips and wait for a better spot. Folding is the only sensible action.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have flop 5c 9c 6d. Our hand Ad 3d gives us a flush draw (diamonds) with Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Board: 5-6-9, we have 3, so open-ended? Actually we have 3, need 4-5-6-7-8? We have 3, board 5-6-9, we could make a straight with 4-5-6-7? Not. We have 3, need 4-5-6-7? Not possible. So only flush draw. Also we have Ace high, maybe a pair of Aces on board? No Aces on board.\n\nWe are on BTN, after flop seat 1 (SB) bet 8 into pot 28, seat2 (BB) called 8, now it's our turn. Stack 167, pot currently 28 + 8+8 =44? Actually pot before bet: 28. SB bet 8 => pot 36, BB called 8 => pot 44, we need call 8. Minimum raise to 16 (so raise to 16 total? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in, so raise to 16 means add 8 more? Wait min raise to: 16 means total bet after raise is 16, which is 8 more than current bet of 8? Actually current bet is 8, so raise to 16 means add 8 more. So raise amount 8.\n\nOur hand: Ace-high flush draw (9 outs? Actually diamonds: we have Ad, 3d. Board diamonds: none. So 13-2 =11 diamonds left. But Ace already in hand, so remaining diamonds 11. But two of those are the 3d? Actually we have 3d, so remaining diamonds are 11 (including Ace? No Ace we have). So 11 outs. Pot odds: call 8 to win 44+8 =52? Actually if we call 8, pot becomes 52, we need to call 8, so odds = 8/(52) = 15.4% required. Flush draw equity ~ (11 outs * 2) = 22% on turn+river, but we only have two streets left. Approx probability to hit flush by river = 1 - ((45/47)*(44/46)) ~? Let's compute: after flop, deck 52-3 board -2 hand =47 cards unknown. Probability hit flush by river = 1 - ( (47-11)/47 * (46-11)/46 ) = 1 - (36/47 * 35/46) = 1 - (0.766 * 0.761) = 1 - 0.583 = 0.417 ~41.7%. So call is profitable. Also we have Ace high, could win if opponent doesn't have better. Opponent likely has a pair or draws. Their bet size is small 8 into 28 (pot 28). Could be a continuation bet with many hands.\n\nWe could also raise to protect and build pot. But our stack is 167, we have room. Minimum raise to 16 is small. Raising may fold out some draws but also increase pot. With 41% equity, raising to 16 (adding 8) yields pot after raise: we add 8, pot becomes 60? Actually currently pot 44, we raise to 16 (so we put in total 16, which includes the 8 call + 8 extra). So we add extra 8, making pot 52 (call) +8 =60? Wait: after SB bet 8, BB called 8, pot 44. If we raise to 16, we need to put in 16 total (i.e., 8 call + 8 raise). So we add 8 more, making pot 44+16 =60. Opponent then can call 8 more (to match 16). So we are building pot.\n\nGiven we have good equity, raising is okay. But also consider position: we are last to act, we could just call to see turn cheap. Opponent's bet is small, maybe they are weak. Raising could scare them away and we win pot uncontested. But we want chips, not necessarily to win small pot.\n\nGiven tournament, stack 41.8 BB, not huge but decent. I think call is fine.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise.

            "reasoning_content": "We have some data: Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat1) has bet on turn in recent hands (10). No data for Kimi-K2 (seat2). So seat1 tends to bet on turn. In this hand they checked, maybe they have a weak hand or trap.\n\nOur hand: Ace high with flush draw. Turn card unknown? The turn card is Kd? Actually board: 5c 9c 6d Kd. That's the turn? Wait board shows 4 cards, so turn is Kd. So turn is a king of diamonds, giving us four diamonds and also a paired king on board (pair of kings). So board now: 5c 9c 6d Kd (king of diamonds). Actually we have Kd on board, we have no king. So there is a pair of kings on board? Only one king on board. So currently no pair on board except Kd. So we have Ace high.\n\nPotential opponent holdings: Could have king, could have flush draw, could have straight draw, could have pair like 9, 5, 6, etc.\n\nWe are in position, both opponents checked. We could check and see river, or we could raise to apply pressure, maybe represent a king or a flush draw, or a strong hand.\n\nStack sizes: We have 159 chips, pot 36. Effective stack for us vs each opponent: seat1 248, seat2 146. So we are short relative to seat1 but bigger than seat2. Raising to 8 minimum would be small, maybe raise to 12? Minimum raise is 8 (to total 8?). Actually current bet is 0, so raise to at least 8 chips. That would be a small raise, about 0.22 BB? Actually 8 chips is 2 BB (since BB 4). So raise to 8 is 2 BB.\n\nWe could raise to 8 (just meet minimum) as a continuation bet to try to steal pot. Since we have a draw, we might want to get value if they call with worse hands.\n\nConsider pot odds: If we call a bet on river (if we raise now and they call) we need to think about equity. But maybe we want to bet now to protect against draws? Opponents may have flush draws? Actually board has two diamonds, they could have two diamonds for flush draw (needs two more diamonds). They could have Ace of diamonds? We have Ace of diamonds, so they cannot have Ace of diamonds. They could have 2d,4d,7d,8d,10d,Jd,Qd for flush draw. So they could have flush draws.\n\nRaising now could be good to charge draws.\n\nGiven opponent seat1 has a tendency to bet on turn, but they checked this time, maybe they have a weak hand and are checking to see. We could raise to apply pressure. Seat2 unknown.\n\nI think raising to 12 (total) would be decent. But min raise is 8, we could raise to 12 to make it a bit bigger.\n\nCheck? If we check, we give free river to opponents. If they have a pair like K, they could bet. Might be okay.\n\nGiven we have decent draw and some equity, I think a small raise is good to protect and get value. So action: raise to 12.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

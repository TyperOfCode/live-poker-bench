            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my situation:\n\n**Hand**: 3c Th (3 of clubs, 10 of hearts)\n**Position**: UTG (Under The Gun - first to act)\n**Stack**: 140 chips (4.4 BB) - This is very short stacked\n**Blinds**: 16/32\n**Pot**: 48 chips\n**Amount to call**: 32 chips\n\nI need to think about this from a tournament perspective with a very short stack.\n\n**Hand analysis**: 3c Th is a very weak hand. It's offsuit, low kicker, and doesn't connect well. Playing this from UTG is extremely marginal.\n\n**Stack considerations**: With only 4.4 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. However, this is an UTG position, meaning 4 players are yet to act behind me. Even with a short stack, I need a decent hand to commit chips.\n\n**Pot odds**: The pot is 48 and I need to call 32, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds. This would require me to win at least 40% of the time to break even. With 3c Th from UTG, my actual equity is likely much lower than this.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB) has been folding a lot preflop\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, BB) has been somewhat passive\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been active with raises and bets\n\nHowever, with my position being UTG, I have to worry about all 4 players behind me, especially the deeper stacked Kimi-K2 in Seat 2 with 461 chips.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 4.4 BB, I need to find spots to get my money in good. This is not that spot. I should wait for a better hand or better position. Folding costs me nothing but the blinds, and I can look for a better opportunity when I'm in later position or have a stronger hand.\n\nDecision: Fold. This hand is too weak to play from UTG with a short stack, and I don't want to commit 23% of my stack with 3c Th.",

I've already posted the small blind of 16, and need to call 16 more to see the flop against the BB who has 133 chips (4.2 BB).\n\nLooking at opponent data: GPT-OSS-120B in the BB has been fairly tight preflop - folding a lot, occasionally calling or checking. They seem to be playing a conservative strategy.\n\nMy hand is A3 offsuit. This is a marginal hand, but being on the button with a short stack changes things. I have position advantage, and the BB has a smaller stack than me (133 vs my 202). \n\nPot odds: I need to call 16 into a pot of 48 (16 SB + 32 BB), so I'm getting 3:1 odds. That's excellent pot odds.\n\nTournament situation: I'm not in immediate danger with 6.3 BB, but I do need to accumulate chips. The BB is even shorter at 4.2 BB, which makes them more likely to defend wide but also more likely to shove if I raise.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: Too tight given the pot odds and position.\n2. Call: Reasonable - see a flop cheaply with position.\n3. Raise: Could be good to take initiative, but my hand isn't strong enough for a big raise.\n\nGiven the BB's tight tendencies and small stack, I think calling is best. If I raise to 64 (minimum raise), I'd be committing 1/3 of my stack, which is too much with A3o. The BB might shove over my raise, putting me in a tough spot.\n\nCalling keeps the pot small, lets me see a flop with position, and preserves my stack. With 3:1 pot odds, I can call with many hands, and A3o has some potential to hit top pair or a draw.\n\nI'll call.",

My hand is weak - Ace-high on KQ2 board\n2. Position advantage (button) - can see opponent's action first on turn\n3. Pot odds: If I check and opponent bets, I'll need to evaluate\n4. Stack preservation vs. aggression: With 5.8 BB, I need to pick spots\n\nGiven the weak hand and dangerous board (KQ high), checking seems prudent. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands. Checking allows me to see what opponent does and potentially bluff later streets if they show weakness.\n\nBetter to check and evaluate opponent's action. If they check back, I get a free turn card. If they bet small, I might have pot odds to call with Ace-high and backdoor draws. If they bet large, I can fold without committing more chips.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Weak Ace-high on KQ2 board, checking to see opponent's action.

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. We're on the turn with 3h Ad, board is Qd 2s Ks 9d. We're on the button with 186 chips (5.8 BB). The pot is 64 chips. We have A3 offsuit, no pair, no draws except a backdoor flush draw with the Ad, but we have the 3h so not really. Actually we have Ace high with backdoor diamond flush draw (need one more diamond on river). Our hand is weak.\n\nOpponent GPT-OSS-120B has 133 chips (4.16 BB) and is in the big blind. They checked preflop and checked the flop. Now it's our action on the turn with amount to call = 0.\n\nLooking at opponent history: They seem fairly tight. In hand 77 they bet 16 on turn after checking flop. In hand 79 they bet 16 on flop after calling preflop. So they do bet sometimes when they have something.\n\nOur hand: Ace high on a KQ92 board. We have no pair, no draw really (backdoor flush draw is weak). We're behind any pair, any king, any queen, any 9, any 2. We're only ahead of complete bluffs.\n\nStack sizes: We have 186, opponent has 133. We're both short stacked (5.8 BB and 4.16 BB). In tournament with such short stacks, we need to accumulate chips. But we have position.\n\nGiven the board texture and our weak hand, checking seems reasonable. If we bet, we might get called or raised by any pair, and we're bluffing with Ace high. The pot is only 64, and we have 186 behind. A bet would commit us given stack sizes.\n\nBut wait - we're on the button, opponent checked twice. They could have a weak hand too. Maybe a small bet could take it down? However, with such short stacks, any bet is a significant portion of our stack. Minimum raise is 32 (half pot), which is 17% of our stack.\n\nGiven tournament situation and short stacks, I think checking is best. We see a free river card, and maybe we hit an ace or diamond. If we bet and get called or raised, we're in a tough spot with Ace high.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. Position: We're on button, so we act last on river. That's an advantage if we check.\n\nOpponent tendencies: They've shown some aggression on turn/flop when they have something. But they checked twice here, so likely weak.\n\nPot odds: Not relevant since no bet.\n\nImplied odds: If we hit an ace on river, we might get some value.\n\nTournament: We're both short, need to accumulate but also preserve. With Ace high, not a great hand to bluff with.\n\nI think check is correct. Let's see the river and reevaluate.",

The river Ace might have improved them if they had an Ace with better kicker, but more likely they have a medium-strength hand.\n\nChecking seems reasonable to:\n1. Avoid value-owning myself if opponent has a better Ace\n2. Potentially win at showdown with my top pair\n3. Preserve my short stack\n\nHowever, a small value bet could extract value from weaker hands like Kx or Qx that might call. But given my weak kicker and opponent's potential to have an Ace with better kicker, checking seems safer.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns with this opponent on river.",

I have option to check or raise.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** I have top pair with a weak kicker (3). Board is Qd 2s Ks 9d Ah. There's a possible flush draw with spades that didn't get there (no spade on river). Straight possibilities: KQ, JT, but board shows Q, K, 9, A - unlikely straight.\n2. **Opponent tendencies:** From the recall, GPT-OSS-120B tends to check on river (2 checks, 1 fold in 3 observed river actions). No observed river bets from this opponent.\n3. **Pot odds:** Pot is 64 chips. If I bet, I need to consider opponent's calling range.\n4. **Stack sizes:** I have 186 chips (5.8 BB), opponent has 133 chips (4.2 BB). A value bet of around half pot (32 chips) would be reasonable.\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With short stacks, accumulating chips is important. However, I'm in better chip position than opponent.\n\n**Decision:** I have top pair on a relatively dry board. Opponent checked twice (flop and turn), suggesting weakness. They likely have a marginal hand or missed draw. A value bet makes sense here to extract value from worse hands that might call (weaker Aces, KQ, etc.). However, I need to be cautious about being raised if opponent has a stronger hand (two pair, set).\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to check on river and my position advantage, I should make a small value bet. Since minimum raise is 32 chips (half pot), that seems reasonable.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 48,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Top pair with weak kicker on dry board.

            "reasoning_content": "We are in BB with 6h Jc, short stack 133 chips (4.2 BB). SB posted 16, BB 32, SB called 16, so pot is 64 (SB 16+BB32+call16). We are in BB, amount to call 0, can check or raise. Hand 6h Jc is weak, not a premium hand, especially short stack. In short stack, need to find spots to shove or fold. But we cannot raise less than min raise 64 (i.e., raise to 64 total? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in; min raise to is 64, meaning you need to put total 64 chips (i.e., raise by 32 more). That would be a raise of 32 additional, making total contribution 64. That is a raise to 64, which is 2 BB raise (since blind is 32). Our stack is 133, so we could raise to 64 (i.e., put 64 total). That would be a 2x raise, leaving us with 69 chips left. However, 6h Jc is not a good hand to raise. Could consider shoving all-in? Not allowed? We can raise only to min raise; we could also go all-in as a raise if we can't meet min raise? The rule says if you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in. But we can afford it. So likely we should fold or check. Checking will see flop cheap, but we are short stacked; if we check and get called, we will see flop with 6h Jc, not great. Better to fold and preserve chips for better spot? But we have only 133 chips, folding loses 32 BB (the blind) but we already posted BB. Actually we are in BB, already posted 32. If we fold now, we lose the BB (32) and are out of the hand. That leaves us with 101 chips left (since we already posted 32). Wait we posted 32, then we can fold (i.e., check). Actually folding after posting BB is just checking? In poker, you cannot fold after posting the blind if no one raised; you can either check (i.e., continue) or raise. If you \"fold\", you would discard your blind and not play? In tournament, you cannot fold the blind after the action returns to you; you can only check or raise. So \"fold\" would be illegal? The legal actions list includes fold, check, raise. So fold is allowed? In many implementations, you can fold after posting blind if there is a raise to you. But here amount to call is 0, so folding means you forfeit your blind? Usually you cannot fold after posting blind unless there is a raise. But the system includes fold as legal. So you could fold and lose your blind, but you keep remaining stack (101). That might be the best given weak hand.\n\nThus decision: fold (i.e., give up the hand). Reason: short stack, weak hand, not worth risking more chips.\n\nReturn JSON.",

So we have basically a junk hand, likely behind any pair. Opponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) checked to us on turn after flop check. So they are checking, maybe they have nothing or a weak hand. The pot is 64, we have 133 stack, we are short-stacked (4.2 BB). Turn is the fourth street, we are out of position (BB vs UTG? Actually seat 3 is UTG? Not sure). But we are out of position relative to opponent (they acted first). With a weak hand and short stack, we could consider folding or maybe making a small raise to steal? But it's a turn, board is fairly coordinated (Q K 9). Opponent checking could be a trap with a strong hand like Qx, Kx, 9x, maybe a straight draw? But they checked, maybe they have medium. Raising with junk is risky. Our stack is small; we could go all-in (133) to try to steal. However, opponent may call with any pair, like Q, K, 9, etc. Our equity is low.\n\nWe should consider tournament stage: we have 133 chips, blinds 16/32, effective stack ~4 BB. We need to survive. If we fold, we keep 133 and wait for better. If we try to steal, we risk being called and eliminated.\n\nGiven we have no showdown value, best is to fold or maybe check. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call is 0, so checking is possible. Since we have no value, checking is fine.\n\nThus decision: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

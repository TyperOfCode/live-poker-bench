            "reasoning_content": "  I need to decide on my action preflop from the BB with 8d Td. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 8d Td is a decent suited connector. It's not a premium hand, but it has good potential in multi-way pots. It can make straights and flushes.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is early position post-flop. However, I get to act last preflop since everyone has called.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 203 chips (101.5 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n4. **Pot size**: The pot is currently 6 chips (2 from me as BB, 2 from Seat 4's call, 1 from SB, and 1 from Seat 5's additional call to match the BB).\n\n5. **Current situation**: Both Seat 4 and Seat 5 have just called the big blind. This suggests they don't have very strong hands (no raises), but they want to see a flop. The pot is multi-way (3 players including me).\n\n6. **Action needed**: I can check (since there's nothing to call) or raise. The minimum raise is to 4 chips total.\n\nLet me think about whether I should check or raise:\n- **Checking**: Allows me to see a free flop with a speculative hand. This is generally good with suited connectors in multi-way pots.\n- **Raising**: Could narrow the field and potentially take down the pot preflop, but I risk building a big pot with a marginal hand out of position.\n\nWith suited connectors like 8d Td, especially in a multi-way pot, I generally want to see a cheap flop. Checking seems like the standard play here. I get to see the flop for free (well, I've already invested my BB) and can evaluate from there.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here since this is a straightforward preflop decision with a speculative hand, and I don't have specific reads on these opponents yet.\n\nLet me make the decision:",

            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the hand situation:\n\n**My hand**: 8d Td (8-10 suited, diamonds)\n**Position**: BB (big blind)\n**Board**: 6s 4c Ks\n**Pot**: 6 chips\n**Stack**: 203 chips (101.5 BB)\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called preflop from MP\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called from SB\n- I checked in BB\n- Now it's checked to me on the flop\n\n**Board analysis**: Ks 6s 4c\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 7 to make 4-5-6-7-8 or 6-7-8-9-T)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (two diamonds)\n- The board has a king, which is a high card that likely connects with opponents' ranges\n\n**Opponent tendencies from recall**:\n- MiniMax-M2: Has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 10, 11, 13), but called this time - might have something decent\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Has been active, calling and raising preflop (hand 10 called, hand 11 raised, hand 13 folded) - seems to play a wide range\n\n**Pot odds**: Currently 0 to call, so I can check for free\n\n**Hand strength**: Very weak. I only have a gutshot and backdoor flush draw. That's approximately:\n- Gutshot: ~4 outs (four 7s) = ~16% equity\n- Backdoor flush: ~4% equity\n- Total: ~20% equity\n\nWith two opponents who both showed interest preflop, at least one likely has a king or better. My hand is very weak.\n\n**Position**: I'm in BB, so I'll act first on the turn if I check now, which is a disadvantage.\n\n**Decision**: I should check. I have a very weak hand with limited draws, and it's a multi-way pot. There's no value in betting here as I can't get better hands to fold, and I don't want to build a pot with such a weak holding. I can take a free card and see if I improve on the turn.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My cards: 8d Td (8-10 of diamonds)\n- Board: 6s 4c Ks 7s\n- Position: BB\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- It's checked to me on the turn\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have an open-ended straight draw: 5-6-7-8-9 (need a 9 to complete)\n- I have a flush draw: two diamonds in hand, three spades on board (so no flush draw)\n- Wait, let me recalculate: Board is 6s 4c Ks 7s - that's 3 spades, 1 club, 1 heart. I have 8d Td (two diamonds). So I have NO flush draw.\n- I have a straight draw: 5-6-7-8-9 (need a 9)\n\nSo I have an open-ended straight draw with 8 outs (four 9s and four 5s).\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 6 chips\n- I can check for free\n- If I bet, I need to consider if I'll get called\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history from the search:\n- Hand 4: Called preflop with 8d Kc, checked down to showdown\n- Hand 7: Checked then bet 2 on turn, opponent folded\n- Hand 9: Called preflop, checked to river, then bet 2 on river\n- Hand 10: Folded preflop\n- Hand 13: Folded preflop\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems to be a relatively passive player who calls preflop sometimes but doesn't get too aggressive. They do make small bets on later streets.\n\n**Position and stack sizes:**\n- I have 203 chips (healthy stack)\n- MiniMax-M2 has 205 chips\n- GPT-OSS-120B has 222 chips\n\n**Decision:**\nI have an open-ended straight draw. I have two options:\n1. Check and see the river for free\n2. Bet to try to win the pot now or build a pot if I hit\n\nGiven that:\n- Both opponents have checked to me\n- I have a decent draw (8 outs \u2248 17% chance to hit on river)\n- The board has 3 spades, which could scare some hands\n- MiniMax-M2 seems passive and might fold to a bet\n- I don't have a made hand yet\n\nI think betting is a good semi-bluff here. A small bet could:\n- Take down the pot immediately\n- Build the pot for when I hit my straight\n- Charge opponents if they're on a flush draw\n\nA bet of 4-6 chips seems appropriate (2/3 to pot size).\n\nLet me check what happened earlier in this hand:\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called, GPT-OSS-120B called, I checked\n- Flop: Everyone checked (6s 4c Ks)\n- Turn: GPT-OSS-120B checked to me\n\nThe flop was checked around, suggesting nobody hit the K or has a strong hand. The turn brings the 7s, adding a third spade. This could complete a flush for someone, but it's more likely it didn't help anyone.\n\nGiven the passive action, I think a bet here is good. I'll make it 5 chips (a little less than pot size).\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The board has 3 spades. Someone could have:\n- A spade (any spade gives them a flush)\n- A made hand like Kx\n- A straight draw like me\n\nBut the fact that everyone checked the flop and turn suggests weakness. However, with 3 spades out there, someone with any spade might call.\n\nGiven I only have a straight draw and no flush draw, and the board is getting scary, maybe checking is better to see the river for free.\n\nBut a semi-bluff is still good. I have 8 clean outs to the nuts (straight). If someone has a flush draw, they might fold to a bet. If they have a made hand like a pair of Kings, they might call but I still have equity.\n\nI'll go with a small bet of 4 chips as a semi-bluff.",

I have 212 chips (106 BB), which is a healthy stack. The blinds are 1/2.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB): Has been folding a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop), but did raise once in hand 8. Might be playing tight.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has been folding most hands preflop, called once, folded last 3 hands.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB): Folded many hands, but showed some aggression in hands 10-11 with raises. Could be selective but aggressive when entering.\n\nMy hand history shows I've been folding a lot (11 of 13 hands folded), but won a pot with 66 from BTN last hand.\n\nK8o is a terrible hand from UTG. It's dominated by many better kings, has poor playability postflop, and I have 3 players left to act after me (Seats 4, 5, 1). Even if I call, I risk being raised by later positions.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 2 to win 3 (pot is 3). That's 1.5:1 odds, but with such a weak hand and poor position, these odds don't compensate for the hand's weakness.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (106 BB). No need to play marginal hands from early position. Better to preserve chips and wait for better spots.\n\nGiven all this, folding is clearly correct. I should wait for a better hand in better position.",

Position: I'm on the button, which is the best position. I'll have position on all opponents post-flop.\n\n3. Pot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win 3 already in the pot, so I'm getting 1.5:1 pot odds. That's quite good.\n\n4. Opponent tendencies: From my memory, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been active with raises, and GPT-OSS-120B has been mostly folding but can raise with strong hands.\n\n5. Stack considerations: I have 103.5 BB, so this is a healthy stack that allows for speculative play.\n\n6. Table dynamics: Two players have already folded (Seats 2 and 3), so this will likely be a 3-way pot (me, Kimi-K2 Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B).\n\nGiven all this, calling seems like the best play. I have a hand that can improve significantly on the flop, good position, and I'm getting good pot odds. Raising would be too aggressive with this speculative hand - I want to keep the pot small and see if I hit big on the flop.\n\nThe fold option is too tight - Qc Tc is too good a hand to fold in this situation, especially on the button with good pot odds.\n",

The King is the highest card, and there are no flush draws visible (though I have Qc which could be part of a flush).\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has checked twice - once preflop and once on the flop\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has checked twice - once preflop and once on the flop\n\n5. **Pot situation**: The pot is 6 chips, and it's currently checked to me (amount to call is 0). I can check, fold, or raise.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - From my recall, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has checked on the flop in 2 previous hands that I can see\n   - I don't have much data on Seat 5's flop behavior\n   - Looking at my own recent hands, I've been quite passive, checking multiple times\n\n7. **Analysis**:\n   - This is a multi-way pot (3 players) that has been checked down so far\n   - With Qc Tc, I have a decent hand with some showdown value\n   - The board is relatively safe and dry\n   - Both opponents have shown weakness by checking twice\n   - I'm in position, which is a big advantage\n\n8. **Options**:\n   - **Check**: This is the safest play. I can see what happens on the turn and potentially get to showdown cheaply.\n   - **Raise**: I could bet to try to take the pot down now, but this might be too aggressive with just Q-high.\n   - **Fold**: This would be too weak given I have decent showdown value and position.\n\n9. **Decision reasoning**:\n   - I have position advantage\n   - My hand has decent showdown value (Q-high with a flush possibility)\n   - Both opponents have shown weakness\n   - The pot is small (6 chips) so I don't need to risk much\n   - Checking allows me to potentially get to showdown cheaply\n   \nPosition play suggests a strategic approach of maintaining control while gathering information. By checking, I can observe opponent behaviors and potentially capitalize on their hesitation. The Qc Tc hand offers enough strength to warrant staying in the hand, especially with the potential for a flush and the current board state. My decision prioritizes positional advantage and minimizes unnecessary risk while keeping the pot manageable.",

If they have any pair (K is on board), any Ace, or any better hand, I'm behind\n2. **Pot odds:** I need to call 10 to win 26 chips (16 current + 10 bet), so I need about 38% equity to break even\n3. **Position:** I'm in position, but that doesn't help much when I'm likely behind\n4. **Tournament considerations:** At 102.5 BB, I'm in good shape - no need to take risky draws\n\n**Potential draws that missed:**\n- I don't have a flush draw (only 1 club, need 4)\n- I don't have an open-ended straight draw (Q-T would need J-9 or A-J to complete)\n- I have a gutshot to a straight if the board was different, but not here\n \nMy hand lacks significant potential. With no clear draws and likely inferior position, the best strategic move is to fold. The bet represents a substantial portion of my stack relative to the pot size, and my cards offer minimal upside. Conserving my tournament chips takes precedence over chasing marginal hands.",

No, Ac9d is offsuit (clubs and diamonds). In SB with 111.5 BB stack, fairly deep. Ac9d is a decent hand but not premium. Considering opponent in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called big blind, likely a decent range maybe wide. In SB we are out of position postflop. Should we raise to isolate? With 111 BB, we could raise to 4 (min raise) to try to steal. But opponent already called, so raising might isolate against a player who likely calls wide. Ac9d is not great for 3-bet; could fold. But also we have good equity vs unknown range. However typical SB play: with A9 off-suit, many would just call or fold. Raising could be okay to try to take pot preflop, but risk of being 3-bet by stronger. Since opponent just called, maybe they have a wide range, so a raise could get folds from weaker.

So no draw. So just Ace high, no pair. Opponent: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 203 chips, currently in BB. Also seat 4 MiniMax-M2 with 205 chips is also in hand? Wait actions: preflop seat4 called 2 (big blind?), seat5 called 1 (SB). So after preflop, we have three players: seat1 (BB) posted 2, seat4 called 2, seat5 called 1. Then flop check each: seat5 check, seat1 check, seat4 check. So all three are still in. Turn now, it's seat5's turn (SB) first? Actually order: after flop, action proceeds from SB? Usually order is SB first preflop, then BB, then UTG etc. On flop, after preflop, action starts with first active player left of button. Since SB is seat5, BB seat1, seat4 is CO? Actually seat4 is maybe UTG? Not needed. So on turn, order continues: seat5 first, then seat1, then seat4. So we have decision.\n\nWe have 6 chips in pot (very small). Stack 222.

Our hand: Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: board has 6,4,K,7. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9? Actually we have 9, board 6,7,? 8 missing, 5 missing. So we have a gutshot: need 8 to make 6-7-8-9-10? Wait 6-7-8-9-10 would need 8 and 10. Not correct. Let's compute possible draws: With 9, we could have a straight 5-6-7-8-9 (need 5 and 8). Not present. So not immediate. Also we have Ace high, no pair. We have a backdoor flush? Board has two spades (6\u2660,7\u2660). We have no spade, so no flush draw. So basically we have Ace high, no draw. Opponent (Seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking) bet 10 on turn. Pot before bet: 16 chips (pre-turn). Actually after flop check, pot still 16? Let's compute: Preflop: blinds 1/2, pot 3 (1+2). Then seat4 called 2, seat5 called 1 (makes total 1+2+2+1 =6?). Wait preflop: seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2, seat4 call 2 (that's a raise? Actually seat4 is in UTG? but they called 2). seat5 call 1 (completes small blind). So pot after preflop: 1+2+2+1 =6. Then flop: all check, pot remains 6. Turn: seat5 check, seat1 bet 10, seat4 fold. So pot before bet: 6. After bet 10, pot becomes 16 (6+10). The amount to call is 10, pot after call would be 26 (if we call). So pot odds: 10 to call, pot 16 (plus our call 10 => 26). So we need 10/26 = 38.5% equity to call break even. Our hand Ace high vs opponent's range. Opponent's betting pattern: Turn bet 10 after board 6s 4c Ks 7s. He could have a variety: maybe a pair (Kx, 6,7), or a draw (flush draw? but board has two spades; opponent could have spade). He could also have Ace high but maybe slower. He bet 10 which is 5 BB (since BB=2). That's a relatively big bet (5 BB) on turn after checking flop. Could be a value bet with Kx or a semi-bluff with spade draw? But there are two spades on board, so a spade draw would be a gutshot? Actually need 2 spades to make flush: board has 2 spades, need 2 more spades in hand (both spades) for a made flush. Opponent could have a spade flush draw with one spade? Actually to have a flush draw, need 4 spades total (3 on board + 1 in hand) for a draw (i.e., have one spade, board has 3 spades). But board only has 2 spades, so a flush draw needs 2 spades in hand (i.e., a \"double suited\" hand). That's less common. So likely not a flush draw.\n\nThus opponent likely has a hand like Kx, 6x, 7x, maybe 8-9 for straight draw? Board: 6-4-K-7. Straight draws: open-ended? 5-6-7-8-9: need 5 and 8. Not there. 6-7-8-9-10: need 8 and 10. Not there. So no immediate draws.\n\nThus opponent probably bets with a made hand (pair, two pair, set) or a bluff. Let's consider his range: He could have Kx (top pair) maybe with kicker. Could also have 6x or 7x (middle pair). Could have 4x (pair). Could have a straight draw like 8-9? Actually 8-9 would give open-ended? 6-7-8-9-10 not there. So no.\n\nThus our Ace high is likely losing. So folding is appropriate.\n\nBut we also need to consider stack sizes: we have 222"

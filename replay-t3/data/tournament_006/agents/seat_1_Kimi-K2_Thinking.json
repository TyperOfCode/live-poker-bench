This is not relevant since my hand is so weak.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: From the limited data:\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB) raised preflop in Hand #1 and continuation bet on the flop\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB) and Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) both called preflop in Hand #1 but folded to the flop bet\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. 3-6 suited is a trash hand from UTG. I should:\n1. Fold this hand 100% of the time from UTG\n2. Preserve my chips for better spots\n3. Avoid playing out of position with weak holdings\n\nThe suitedness doesn't make up for how weak this hand is. Even if I flop a flush draw, it would be a low flush draw that could easily be dominated.

This is known as a \"trash\" hand in poker. J-3 offsuit has very poor equity against any random hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, which is out of position postflop. This is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) just called preflop. This could mean:\n   - They have a speculative hand (suited connectors, small pairs)\n   - They have a medium strength hand\n   - They could be trying to see a cheap flop\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 5 chips and I can check to see a free flop.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 99 BB, I have a healthy stack. I should be selective with my hands and not get involved in marginal spots.\n\n**Decision**: With J-3 offsuit, I should check and see a free flop. Raising would be spewing chips with a very weak hand out of position. Folding would be giving up a free look at the flop. The correct play is to check.\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools here since this is a straightforward decision and I don't have specific reads on MiniMax-M2 yet.

I have no hand, no draw, and I'm out of position. Checking is the only reasonable play here.\n\nI cannot bet for value as I have no hand.

I have absolutely nothing. No pair, no draw. The board has an Ace, King, Ten, Seven, Eight. I have Jack high.\n\n**Opponent info from recall:**\nMiniMax-M2 has shown:\n- Hand 1: Preflop raise (4), flop bet (8) - aggressive\n- Hand 2: Preflop fold\n- Hand 3: Preflop fold\n\nSo they can be aggressive but also fold preflop. They called preflop this hand but checked the flop. This suggests they might have something marginal or a draw.\n\n**Board analysis:**\n7c 8c As Th - There are straight draws (9-J would make a straight, but I don't have that). There are club flush draws. The Ace is on the board.\n\n**My decision:**\nI have absolutely nothing. I should check this turn card and see what happens. There's no reason to bet with Jack high. I can check and potentially see a free river card. If my opponent bets, I'll likely fold unless it's a very small bet with good odds (which is unlikely given the board texture).\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to bet:\n- As a bluff? Unlikely to work - the board is coordinated with an Ace and straight/flush possibilities. My opponent would likely call with any pair or draw.\n- For value? No, I have no value.\n- To protect? No hand to protect.\n\nConclusion: Check and see the river for free.",

I have second pair with a terrible kicker (3), and there are many hands that beat me:\n- Any club (flush)\n- Any Ace\n- Any two pair\n- Any set\n- Any straight\n\nGiven that:\n1. My opponent has shown aggression when they play\n2. They've checked all streets so far (indicating weakness)\n3. The board is dangerous with a flush draw\n4. I have a very weak made hand\n5. I can check for free\n\nI should check and see if my opponent checks behind. If they bet, I'll likely need to fold since my hand is so weak and there are many better hands possible.\n\nChecking is the optimal play here - it's free and allows me to see if my opponent has anything or if I might win at showdown with my weak pair.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Now let me analyze the situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 9s Qh - This is a decent speculative hand, especially in position (Button). Queen-high with a suited connector potential.\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - Best position at the table, I get to act last postflop.\n\n**Stack**: 202 chips (101 BB) - Deep stack, plenty of room to play.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- SB (Seat 2): Kimi-K2 - Based on history, they've been somewhat active but tends to fold postflop. They've called preflop raises and then folded on the flop in previous hands.\n- BB (Seat 3): DeepSeek-V3.2 - More aggressive player. Made a big preflop raise to 18 chips in hand #2 and followed with a 20 chip bet on the flop. They've been folding more recently though (last 3 hands).\n\n**Pot**: 3 chips (1+2 blinds)\n\n**Action to me**: Need to call 2 chips to see flop\n\n**My recent play**: I've been playing very tight - folded 4 out of 5 hands, won 1 small pot. This is good for my table image.\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. Q9s is a decent hand on the button\n2. I'm deep stacked (101 BB)\n3. Both opponents have shown willingness to fold postflop\n4. I have position advantage\n5. Pot odds: 2 to win 3 (1.5:1) - not great but with position and deep stack, I can see a flop\n6. I can potentially steal the blinds with a raise\n\nGiven I'm on the button with a decent speculative hand, deep stack, and position advantage against two opponents who fold postflop, I should either:\n- Call and see a flop in position\n- Raise to try to steal the blinds\n\nA standard raise would be to 6-8 chips (3-4x BB). Given both opponents have folded to pressure before, a raise has good fold equity.\n\nI think raising is the best play here. It gives me two ways to win:\n1. They fold preflop and I win 3 chips\n2. They call and I have position with a decent hand\n\nLet me raise to 8 chips (4x BB) which is a standard sizing.",

Q6o is not a strong hand and should generally be folded in most situations.\n\n**Position:** I'm in the BB, which gives me position advantage post-flop.\n\n**Opponent analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nLooking at the recall data for MiniMax-M2:\n- Hand 1: Raised preflop, bet flop (likely strong hand)\n- Hand 2: Folded preflop\n- Hand 3: Folded preflop\n- Hand 4: Called preflop, checked down flop/turn/river (likely weak/marginal hand, showed down K8o)\n- Hand 5: Folded preflop\n- Hand 6: Folded preflop\n- Hand 7: Checked preflop, checked flop, bet turn (somewhat passive)\n- Hand 8: Folded preflop\n\nThis opponent seems relatively tight/passive. They call preflop with marginal hands like K8o, and often fold. The preflop call here suggests they have some hand but not necessarily strong.\n\n**Pot odds:** There's 5 chips in the pot and I can check for free. No reason to fold when I can see a flop for free.\n\n**Decision:** Checking is the clear best option here. I have a weak hand but I'm getting free cards to see if I hit something. Raising with Q6o against a tight opponent who called from early position would be burning chips. \n\nI should check and see the flop.",

The small bet sizing suggests they may not be super aggressive.\n\n**Current Situation**:\n- Pot: 5 chips\n- I have bottom pair on a dangerous board\n- No one has bet yet (I have option to check or raise)\n- MiniMax just called preflop from MP position\n\n**Decision Factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Weak - bottom pair with bad kicker on coordinated board\n2. **Board texture**: Very dangerous - flush draw, straight draws\n3. **Opponent**: Passive, unlikely to bet without a strong hand\n4. **Position**: I'm out of position which is bad\n5. **Stack size**: Healthy at 103 BB\n\n**Options**:\n- **Check**: Let opponent see free card, but I have weak hand and want to control pot size\n- **Raise**: Try to take pot down now, but risk getting called/raised by better hands\n\nGiven the dangerous board and my weak hand, checking seems best. I want to see what MiniMax does. If they bet, I can likely fold since my hand is marginal. If they check, I get a free card to improve.\n\nThe only argument for betting would be to protect against draws, but with bottom pair and a passive opponent, it's better to pot control and see a cheap showdown or fold to aggression.",

Checking seems the most prudent approach, as betting would likely be met with resistance from better holdings. The pot is small, so there's minimal incentive to risk additional chips with such a weak pair. \n\nI'll carefully evaluate potential opponent holdings. They could easily have trips, a higher pair, or be drawing to a stronger combination. My best strategy is to show weakness and avoid unnecessary chip commitment.\n\nThe board texture suggests multiple potential threats - a paired board, possible flush, and straight draws. With my limited hand strength, a defensive check is the optimal play.",

There's 0 to call, so checking is free. Betting would be a pure bluff since I have very little showdown value, and MiniMax-M2 has shown they can call preflop and check down, so they're not an easy target to bluff.\n\nChecking is the clear best play here.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**My hand:** Qc 6s - I have a pair of 6s\n**Board:** Td 6d 7d 7h Ad - This is a very scary board with:\n- A flush draw that completed on the river (3 diamonds)\n- A full house possibility (two 7s)\n- A straight possibility (8-9 for straight)\n- The Ace on the river is very threatening\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** MiniMax-M2 has been relatively passive, checking through most streets. They've only bet twice in the hands I can see:\n- Hand 1: Raised preflop, bet flop\n- Hand 7: Checked through flop, bet turn\n\nIn hand 4 they called preflop and then checked all the way to showdown with 8d Kc.\n\n**Current situation:** \n- Pot is 7 chips\n- Opponent bets 2 chips on the river\n- I have to call 2 chips\n\n**My hand strength:** I have a weak pair of 6s with a Queen kicker. Given the board texture, this is extremely weak. There are so many hands that beat me:\n- Any Ace (now has top pair)\n- Any diamond (has a flush)\n- Any 7 (has trips or full house)\n- Any two pair combination\n- Even just a Ten has me beat\n\n**Opponent's bet:** The bet is very small (2 into 7 pot), which could mean:\n1. They're value betting a strong hand but trying to get called\n2. They're bluffing with a small bet to fold out weak hands\n3. They have a marginal hand and want to see if it's good\n\nGiven the opponent's passive nature and the fact that they've checked through multiple times before, this river bet likely represents some strength. However, the small sizing is interesting.\n\n**Pot odds:** I'm getting 9:2 odds (4.5:1), so I only need to win 18% of the time to break even.\n\n**Decision:** Even with good pot odds, my hand is extremely weak given the board texture. The Ace on the river hits many hands, the flush got there, and there are full house possibilities. I have no showdown value here other than a weak pair.\n\nAgainst a passive opponent who has finally decided to bet the river on this scary board, I should fold. My hand is just too weak to call, even with good pot odds.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider the pot odds more carefully. The pot is 7, opponent bets 2, so pot becomes 9. I need to call 2 to win 9. That's 4.5 to 1 odds, meaning I need to win 18.2% of the time.\n\nGiven how weak my hand is and how coordinated this board is, I think folding is correct. A passive opponent betting into this board when I've shown weakness by checking all streets is likely to have something.",

This is their first preflop action other than folding. This suggests they may have a real hand this time.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: T5 offsuit is extremely weak. No suitedness, no connectivity, only one high card (T).\n2. **Position**: Worst position (SB), will act first on every street postflop.\n3. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B has been very tight, folding 8/8 hands preflop. Their call here suggests actual hand strength.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 1 chip to win 5 chips = 5:1 pot odds. While this seems good, my hand has very poor equity against any legitimate calling range.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my chips for better opportunities.\n\nEven with good pot odds (5:1), T5 offsuit from the SB against a tight player who is showing strength by calling (after 8 straight folds) is a clear fold. I'll be out of position with a very weak hand that rarely makes strong hands postflop.\n\nThe only consideration might be to raise as a steal attempt, but:\n- The opponent has shown they're tight and may not fold\n\n\n- Raising to 4 chips with T5 offsuit is a high-risk, low-reward strategy\n- I'm out of position, which compounds the potential losses\n- The tight opponent's call suggests they have a hand they're willing to defend\n\nI'll fold and wait for a stronger hand in a better position. The marginal pot odds don't justify the significant risk of playing such a weak hand out of position.\n\nA cautious approach preserves my chip stack for more favorable opportunities. By folding now, I avoid potential large losses and maintain flexibility for future hands.",

This is limited information, but it suggests they are capable of betting/raising.\n\nLet me analyze my current situation:\n- Hand: 3d Ac (offsuit, low kicker)\n- Position: BTN (good position)\n- Stack: 205 chips (102.5 BB)\n- Pot: 9 chips\n- To call: 6 chips\n- I have Ace-3 offsuit\n\nThis is a marginal hand. Let me consider:\n1. **Hand strength**: Ace-high with a weak kicker. Not a strong hand, especially offsuit.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position, but that doesn't make up for the weak hand.\n3. **Opponent**: Only one opponent has shown aggression so far (seat 5). The recall shows they raised in the previous hand on the flop, but that's not enough data to establish a pattern.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 6 to win 9, so 6:9 or 1:1.5. Not great odds for a weak hand.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (102.5 BB). I don't need to take marginal spots like this. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nAce-3 offsuit is a fold in most situations preflop, especially facing a raise. The only exception might be if the raiser is extremely loose and I have them covered, but I don't have enough information to make that determination. Folding is the disciplined play here.",

I'll be acting first on all streets, which is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 205 chips (102.5 BB) - Healthy stack, no immediate pressure.\n\n4. **Action**: I'm facing a 2 chip call (BB) to see the flop. The pot is currently 3 chips.\n\n5. **Opponent observations**: From the recalled actions:\n   - Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) seems aggressive, made a raise from 6 to 20 in hand 11\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) also showed aggression with re-raises\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 and MiniMax-M2 have shown folds\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: Early in tournament with healthy stack. UTG with pocket sixes is a fold in most situations due to:\n   - High chance of facing raises from players behind\n   - Vulnerable to overcards on flop\n   - Reverse implied odds (when we hit a set, we might not get paid enough, but when overcards come, we often lose)\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 to win 3 chips (1.5:1). This isn't relevant for a fold decision here.\n\n8. **Strategy**: With pocket pairs from early position, the standard play is to either:\n   - Fold (conservative, recommended for beginners)\n   - Open-raise (aggressive, but risky from UTG with 66)\n   \n   From UTG, pocket sixes are generally a fold because:\n   - 5 players left to act who could have better hands\n   - If I get raised, I'll likely have to fold\n   - Even if I see a flop, I'll be out of position\n\nThe best play here is to fold. While 66 is a playable hand in late position or against a single opponent, from UTG with multiple players behind, it's too risky. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

It's not a premium hand, but it has good potential in multi-way pots. It can make straights and flushes.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is early position post-flop. However, I get to act last preflop since everyone has called.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 203 chips (101.5 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n4. **Pot size**: The pot is currently 6 chips (2 from me as BB, 2 from Seat 4's call, 1 from SB, and 1 from Seat 5's additional call to match the BB).\n\n5. **Current situation**: Both Seat 4 and Seat 5 have just called the big blind. This suggests they don't have very strong hands (no raises), but they want to see a flop. The pot is multi-way (3 players including me).\n\n6. **Action needed**: I can check (since there's nothing to call) or raise. The minimum raise is to 4 chips total.\n\nLet me think about whether I should check or raise:\n- **Checking**: Allows me to see a free flop with a speculative hand. This is generally good with suited connectors in multi-way pots.\n- **Raising**: Could narrow the field and potentially take down the pot preflop, but I risk building a big pot with a marginal hand out of position.\n\nWith suited connectors like 8d Td, especially in a multi-way pot, I generally want to see a cheap flop. Checking seems like the standard play here. I get to see the flop for free (well, I've already invested my BB) and can evaluate from there.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here since this is a straightforward preflop decision with a speculative hand, and I don't have specific reads on these opponents yet.\n\nLet me make the decision:",

I have a very weak hand with limited draws, and it's a multi-way pot. There's no value in betting here as I can't get better hands to fold, and I don't want to build a pot with such a weak holding.

Board shows 3 spades but both opponents have shown weakness by checking. MiniMax-M2 appears passive based on history. A pot-sized bet applies pressure and builds pot for when I hit.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My cards: 8d Td (8-10 of diamonds)\n- Board: 6s 4c Ks 7s\n- Position: BB\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- It's checked to me on the turn\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have an open-ended straight draw: 5-6-7-8-9 (need a 9 to complete)\n- I have a flush draw: two diamonds in hand, three spades on board (so no flush draw)\n- Wait, let me recalculate: Board is 6s 4c Ks 7s - that's 3 spades, 1 club, 1 heart. I have 8d Td (two diamonds). So I have NO flush draw.\n- I have a straight draw: 5-6-7-8-9 (need a 9)\n\nSo I have an open-ended straight draw with 8 outs (four 9s and four 5s).\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 6 chips\n- I can check for free\n- If I bet, I need to consider if I'll get called\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history from the search:\n- Hand 4: Called preflop with 8d Kc, checked down to showdown\n- Hand 7: Checked then bet 2 on turn, opponent folded\n- Hand 9: Called preflop, checked to river, then bet 2 on river\n- Hand 10: Folded preflop\n- Hand 13: Folded preflop\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems to be a relatively passive player who calls preflop sometimes but doesn't get too aggressive. They do make small bets on later streets.\n\n**Position and stack sizes:**\n- I have 203 chips (healthy stack)\n- MiniMax-M2 has 205 chips\n- GPT-OSS-120B has 222 chips\n\n**Decision:**\nI have an open-ended straight draw. I have two options:\n1. Check and see the river for free\n2. Bet to try to win the pot now or build a pot if I hit\n\nGiven that:\n- Both opponents have checked to me\n- I have a decent draw (8 outs \u2248 17% chance to hit on river)\n- The board has 3 spades, which could scare some hands\n- MiniMax-M2 seems passive and might fold to a bet\n- I don't have a made hand yet\n\nI think betting is a good semi-bluff here. A small bet could:\n- Take down the pot immediately\n- Build the pot for when I hit my straight\n- Charge opponents if they're on a flush draw\n\nA bet of 4-6 chips seems appropriate (2/3 to pot size).\n\nLet me check what happened earlier in this hand:\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called, GPT-OSS-120B called, I checked\n- Flop: Everyone checked (6s 4c Ks)\n- Turn: GPT-OSS-120B checked to me\n\nThe flop was checked around, suggesting nobody hit the K or has a strong hand. The turn brings the 7s, adding a third spade. This could complete a flush for someone, but it's more likely it didn't help anyone.\n\nGiven the passive action, I think a bet here is good. I'll make it 5 chips (a little less than pot size).\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The board has 3 spades. Someone could have:\n- A spade (any spade gives them a flush)\n- A made hand like Kx\n- A straight draw like me\n\nBut the fact that everyone checked the flop and turn suggests weakness. However, with 3 spades out there, someone with any spade might call.\n\nGiven I only have a straight draw and no flush draw, and the board is getting scary, maybe checking is better to see the river for free.\n\nBut a semi-bluff is still good. I have 8 clean outs to the nuts (straight). If someone has a flush draw, they might fold to a bet. If they have a made hand like a pair of Kings, they might call but I still have equity.\n\nI'll go with a small bet of 4 chips as a semi-bluff.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 9h 9d - Pocket nines. This is a strong starting hand, especially in a tournament with 104 BB stacks.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB, which is out of position postflop. This is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6. This is a 3x raise from the BTN/CO position (seat 5 in a 5-player game).\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n   - Very tight preflop: folded in hands 1-9, then started playing more\n   - In hand 10: called preflop, then raised on flop (showing aggression postflop)\n   - In hand 11: raised preflop to 6, then re-raised to 34 (showing very strong hand)\n   - Hands 12-13: folded preflop\n   - Hand 14: called 1, then checked flop and turn, folded to turn bet\n\n   This opponent appears to be relatively tight but capable of making big raises with strong hands. The raise to 6 could be a standard opening, but based on their tight nature, it's likely a strong hand.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 5 to win 9 (SB + BB + raise). That's 5/14 = 35.7% equity needed.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 104 BB, which is a healthy stack. I don't need to take unnecessary risks, but pocket nines are strong enough to play.\n\n7. **Decision factors**:\n   - Pocket nines are strong but vulnerable to overcards\n   - I'm out of position, which makes it harder to realize equity\n   - Opponent appears tight and likely has a strong range\n   - The raise size is standard (3x), not overly large\n   - I have good stack depth to set mine (trying to hit a set)\n\nWith pocket nines, I have a few options:\n- Fold: Too tight, especially with this hand strength and stack depth\n- Call: Reasonable for set mining, but out of position makes it tough\n- Raise: Could 3-bet to take control or get value from weaker hands\n\nGiven that I'm out of position and facing a tight opponent, I think folding is too weak, and calling is reasonable. However, with pocket nines and a tight opponent, a 3-bet could be good to either take the pot preflop or define the opponent's hand strength.\n\nLet me consider a 3-bet sizing. Minimum raise is to 10, which would be a small 3-bet. A more standard 3-bet would be 3x their raise (to 18) or about 15-20 chips.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the opponent's pattern:\n- They raised to 6 in hand 11, then 4-bet to 34 (very large)\n- They seem to play strong hands aggressively\n- They're tight overall\n\nGiven this, if I 3-bet, they might only continue with very strong hands (QQ+, AK), which would put my 99 in bad shape. If they call, I'm out of position with a hand that often flops an overcard.\n\nThe safer play is to call and set mine. I have good implied odds with 104 BB stack vs their 108 BB stack. If I hit a set, I can win a big pot. If I don't hit, I can easily fold to aggression.\n\nI think calling is the best play here. It's conservative but appropriate given my position and opponent's tight nature.",

The board has an Ace which is concerning, as many hands that would raise preflop could contain an Ace.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB position, which is good post-flop position.\n\n3. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B raised preflop to 6 chips (3x BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They fold a lot preflop (many folds)\n   - They've raised preflop a few times (hands 11, 14)\n   - In hand 10, they called preflop and then raised on the flop\n   - In hand 11, they raised preflop and then raised again (re-raise)\n   - In hand 14, they called preflop and then checked the flop and turn before folding\n\n   This suggests they can be aggressive but also give up when they miss.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 14 chips and it's checked to me. I can check for free and see the turn.\n\n5. **Board texture**: The board is rainbow (6s Ac 3h - spades, clubs, hearts) with no flush draw. There are some straight possibilities (4-5, 5-7, 7-8) but not many. The Ace is the main concern.\n\n6. **My stack**: I have 203 chips, which is a healthy stack.\n\n**Decision analysis**:\n- I have a medium pocket pair that could be ahead if my opponent doesn't have an Ace\n- The board is relatively dry with no flush draws\n- My opponent raised preflop, which often indicates strength, but could be a wide range\n- I can check for free and see what happens on the turn\n- If I bet, I might fold out worse hands and only get called by better hands (any Ace)\n- Checking allows me to control the pot size and potentially get to showdown cheaply\n\nGiven that I have position and can check for free, I should check here. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands (any Ace). Checking allows me to see the turn card for free and reassess.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The user is playing poker and has provided the current state of Hand #15. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: BB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: 9h 9d (pocket nines)\n- Stack: 203 chips (101.5 BB)\n- Board: 6s Ac 3h Th (Turn)\n- Pot: 14 chips\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 with 216 chips\n\n**Action History:**\n- Preflop: Seat 5 raised to 6, I called 5 (from BB)\n- Flop: I checked, Seat 5 checked\n- Turn: Action is on me\n\n**Current Decision:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n- Minimum raise to: 4\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have pocket 9s\n- Board: 6s Ac 3h Th\n- This is a relatively dry board with one overcard (Ace)\n- I have an overpair to the board (9s vs 6,3,T)\n- However, the Ace is scary as opponent could have Ax\n- No flush draws possible (no 3 of same suit)\n- Straight draws: 45, 57, 89, JQ possible but not very likely\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recalled actions, GPT-OSS-120B has been:\n- Very tight preflop: folded 9 out of 11 preflop opportunities before this hand\n- When they entered hand #10: called preflop, then raised on flop\n- Hand #11: raised preflop to 6, then re-raised to 34 (big aggression)\n- Hand #14: called preflop, checked flop and turn, then folded\n\nThis suggests they're TAG (tight-aggressive). They fold most hands, but when they play, they can be aggressive. The check on flop after raising preflop suggests:\n1. They have a strong hand but are trapping (less likely)\n2. They have a marginal hand that missed the flop (more likely)\n3. They have AK/AQ that missed and are giving up\n\n**Position & Stack:**\n- I'm out of position (BB vs their late position)\n- Both stacks are deep (~100+ BB)\n- Pot is small (14 chips)\n\n**Decision Options:**\n1. **Check**: Show weakness, let them bet if they have something, control pot size\n2. **Bet**: Protect hand, get value from worse hands, charge draws\n3. **Fold**: Too weak with overpair\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- The Ace on board is concerning - they could have AK, AQ, AJ\n- But they checked flop, which weakens their range\n- My hand is vulnerable to overcards\n- I need to protect my hand and get value from worse pairs (77, 88, TT, JJ might call)\n- Checking could induce bluffs but also gives free cards\n\n**Recommended Action:**\nI should make a value bet here. The opponent checked the flop which suggests they don't have a strong Ace. My pocket 9s are likely ahead of their range. A bet will:\n1. Protect against overcards on river\n2. Get value from worse hands\n3. Charge any draws (though few exist)\n4. Define their hand strength\n\nGiven pot is 14, a bet of 8-12 chips seems appropriate. Minimum raise is 4 (which would be a bet of 4), but that's too small. I should bet around 2/3 pot, so about 9-10 chips.\n\nLet me check what the minimum raise to 4 means - this would be a total bet of 4 chips, which is too small. I need to bet more.\n\nI'll bet 10 chips (which is raise_to 10).",

Stack size: I have a healthy stack of 108.5 BB. I shouldn't risk chips with such a weak hand.\n\n4. Pot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win 3 chips, which is 1.5:1 pot odds.

It's not connected, not suited, and both cards are low.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (Under the Gun), which is the worst position preflop. I have to act first on all postflop streets.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have a healthy stack of 108.5 BB, so I can afford to fold marginal hands.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: Early in tournaments, the goal is to preserve my stack and wait for better spots. Playing garbage hands from early position is a recipe for disaster.\n\nEven though it's only 2 chips to call (1% of my stack), the problem is:\n- I'll be out of position postflop\n- I have no hand equity\n- Even if I hit something (like a pair of 7s or 4s), I'll likely be dominated\n- This hand has almost no potential to make strong hands\n\nThe correct play is to fold this hand preflop from UTG position.",

One of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n**Position:** I'm in the BB (Big Blind), so I'm out of position post-flop.\n\n**Stack:** 215 chips (107.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Current Action:** MiniMax-M2 called from middle position (seat 4), and everyone else folded. It's back to me in the BB.\n\n**Pot:** 5 chips (2 from SB, 2 from BB, 1 from MiniMax-M2's call)\n\n**Amount to call:** 0 (I already posted the BB, and MiniMax-M2 just called the BB)\n\n**Legal actions:** fold, check, raise\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- Mostly folds (hands 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18)\n- One preflop call in hand 14, then check-folded on the turn\n- This suggests MiniMax-M2 is relatively tight and only calls with decent hands\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 8-3 offsuit is extremely weak. Should almost never be played, especially out of position.\n2. **Pot odds:** I can check and see a free flop since I already have 2 chips invested and MiniMax-M2 just called.\n3. **Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 appears to be a tight player who mostly folds preflop. When they do call, they likely have a decent hand.\n4. **Position:** I'll be out of position post-flop, which makes playing a weak hand even more difficult.\n5. **Tournament considerations:** While I have a healthy stack, there's no need to risk chips with such a weak hand. The only argument for checking is that it's free, but even then, I'm likely to be dominated post-flop.\n\n**Decision:** With 8-3 offsuit against a tight opponent who called from middle position, I should fold. Even though checking is free, playing this hand out of position is -EV long term. The risk of getting into trouble post-flop with a weak hand isn't worth the potential reward of winning a small pot.\n\n\nI'm folding this trash hand. 8-3 offsuit is unplayable, especially against a tight opponent who likely has a decent range. No point in seeing a free flop with such a weak hand when I'll be out of position and vulnerable post-flop.",

They call preflop with some hands but then check flops frequently. When they do bet, it's usually small bets (2 chips).\n\n**Position and pot odds:**\n- I'm out of position (acting first)\n- Pot is 5 chips (2 from BB, 2 from MiniMax's call, 1 from SB)\n- It costs me 0 to check\n- I could bet, but with my weak hand, that's not advisable\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 215 chips (107.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- No need to get involved with marginal hands\n- Better spots will come\n\n**Decision: Check**\n\nI have absolutely nothing with 8-3 offsuit on this board. The only reason to bet would be as a bluff, but:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. My opponent called preflop, so they likely have something\n3. MiniMax-M2 plays passively and will likely just fold if they miss or call if they hit\n4. There's no need to risk chips with this weak hand\n\nThe best play is to check and see if we can get a free card to hit an 8 or 3, but realistically, I'm planning to fold to any reasonable bet on the turn unless I improve significantly.",

I have:\n- No pair\n- No straight draw (backdoor only)\n- No flush draw (backdoor only)\n- 8 high\n\nThe only way I win is if opponent is bluffing AND gives up later, or if I hit runner-runner perfect cards.\n\nGiven that I have a very weak hand with no real draws, and I'm out of position, I should fold. The small bet size suggests opponent might be weak, but I can't rely on that with 8-high. I should preserve my chips and wait for a better spot.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold with a trash hand against any opponent action.\n\nDecision: Fold",

Low suited connectors can have some playability in certain situations, but offsuit they're very weak.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions since I'll be out of position postflop.\n\n3. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 4. I need to call 3 chips to see the flop.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 214 chips (107 BB)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B: 209 chips\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data:\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively tight, folding preflop in 4 of the last 6 hands\n   - When they do raise (Hand 15), they bet 6 preflop, then checked flop and folded to a turn bet\n   - They seem to give up easily postflop\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 3 to win 7, so 3:7 or about 30% equity needed.\n\n7. **Hand equity**: 6-5 offsuit has about 35-40% equity against a random hand, but against a tight raiser's range, it's probably more like 25-30%. \n\n8. **Implied odds**: With my stack depth (107 BB), I have good implied odds if I hit a strong hand. However, being out of position makes it harder to realize those implied odds.\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots, especially out of position with weak hands.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. While I have deep stacks and good implied odds potential, I'm out of position with a very weak hand against a tight opponent. The times I hit the flop, I'll often be dominated or have weak draws. The position disadvantage makes it hard to realize my equity and implied odds.\n\nI should save my chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand:** Qc Ks - This is KQo, a strong offsuit hand but from UTG position. This is typically a marginal hand in early position.\n\n**Position:** UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table. I have 8 players left to act behind me.\n\n**Stack:** 220 chips (55 BB) - This is a healthy stack, not too short but also not deep stacked.\n\n**Opponents:** Looking at the recall data, I can see some patterns:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Seen folding a lot preflop, but also called and bet on flop in hand 20\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Playing quite tight, folding frequently preflop\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Mixed play, folding often but also calling and betting small amounts\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has made some raises and folds\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 55 BB, I should be playing a solid TAG (tight-aggressive) strategy. From UTG, I should be very selective with my hands.\n\n**Hand strength analysis:** KQo is a decent hand, but it's dominated by many hands that might call or raise from later positions (AA, KK, QQ, AK, AQ). From UTG, standard play is to fold KQo because:\n1. Too many players left to act\n2. Likely to be dominated if we get action\n3. Difficult to play post-flop out of position\n\nThe pot is only 6 chips, so there's no pressure to defend.\n\n**Standard ranges:** From UTG with 55 BB, typical opening range is something like: 77+, AJ+, KQs, AQo+. Some players even tighter. KQo is right on the borderline but generally considered a fold from UTG in full ring.\n\n**Conclusion:** I should fold KQo from UTG. While it's a decent hand, the positional disadvantage and risk of being dominated make this a clear fold in a tournament setting where preserving chips is important. I can wait for better spots in better position.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: SB (Seat 1) - small blind\n- Hand: Kc 2c (King of clubs, 2 of clubs)\n- Stack: 220 chips (55 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 18 chips (2 from SB + 4 from BB + 12 from raise)\n- Amount to call: 10 (the raise is 12, I've already posted 2)\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise to 20+\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nK2s (suited) is a very marginal hand. It's a \"trouble hand\" because:\n- Dominated by any other king (KX where X > 2)\n- Weak kicker\n- Only suited connector potential is very limited (need both a 3 and an ace for a straight)\n- Flush potential is there but low\n\n**Position:** \nI'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions. I'll be out of position post-flop.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent history:\n- Very tight player (folded preflop in hands 13, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24)\n- When they do raise (hands 15, 20), they often fold on later streets\n- They seem to be playing a tight-aggressive style but giving up easily\n\nTheir raise to 12 (3x BB) from CO position suggests they have a real hand, not just a steal attempt. Given their tight nature, this is likely a strong range (pairs, broadway cards, strong aces, etc.).\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- To call: 10 chips to win 18 chips = 1.8:1 or ~35.7% equity needed\n- K2s typically has around 30-35% equity against a standard raising range\n- The pot odds are marginal at best\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (55 BB)\n- This is not a spot to risk chips with a marginal hand\n- Better to preserve my stack for better opportunities\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEven though the opponent appears tight and might be raising light, K2s is just too weak to defend from the SB. The hand is dominated too often, I'll be out of position, and the pot odds don't justify the call. This is a clear fold.\n\n**Decision:** Fold",

The only time they didn't fold preflop was in hand 19 where they called 2 (likely a limp or small raise). This suggests they're raising with a strong range.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win a pot of 14 (SB 2 + BB 4 + MiniMax-M2 8). That's 14:8 or 1.75:1, which means I need ~36% equity to call profitably.\n\n**Hand equity**: K3o against a tight raising range (likely something like 77+, AJ+, KQ) has terrible equity - probably around 25-30% at best.\n\n**Position advantage**: Even on the button, this hand is very difficult to play postflop. If I hit a K, I'm often dominated by better kickers. If I hit a 3, it's rarely good.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 55 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nGiven:\n1. Very weak hand (K3o)\n2. Facing a raise from a tight player\n3. Bad pot odds for this hand\n4.

I need to respond with a JSON object containing my action decision.\n\nLet me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Position: CO (Seat 1) - Good position, 2 seats from the button\n- Cards: Jc As (AJ suited clubs) - Strong hand\n- Stack: 220 chips (55 BB) - Healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 18 chips\n- Action: Seat 5 raised to 12 (3x BB)\n- To call: 12 chips\n- Can raise to minimum 20 (which would be a min-raise)\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nAJ suited is a strong hand, especially in position. In CO, this is definitely a playable hand. I need to consider:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: AJ suited is in the top 10-12% of hands. Strong enough to play, especially in position.\n2. **Position**: CO is good position - I'll act after the raiser on all streets.\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 5 raised from early position (relative to blinds). This suggests strength.\n4. **Stack depth**: At 55 BB, I have room to play post-flop.\n5. **Pot odds**: Calling 12 to win 18 = 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed. AJ suited has good equity against most ranges.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight for AJ suited in CO\n- **Call**: Reasonable, see a flop in position\n- **Raise**: Could 3-bet to apply pressure\n\nGiven AJ suited's strength and my position, I think a 3-bet is appropriate. This can:\n- Get value from worse hands\n- Fold out some better hands (like KQ, QJ)\n- Take control of the hand\n- Potentially win preflop\n\nStandard 3-bet size would be 3-4x the original raise. The raise was 12, so 3x would be 36, 4x would be 48.\n\nLet me make a standard 3-bet to 36 chips (3x the original raise).",

This player is clearly playing very tight.\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**: Also very tight - folded 8 out of 10 times preflop, with one raise and one flop bet. Very conservative player.\n\n**Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)**: Moderately tight - folded 7 out of 10 times, but did call once and raise once. They posted the small blind this hand.\n\n**Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)**: Moderately aggressive - folded 6 out of 10 times, but has raised twice (including to 12 chips) and made a call. They posted the big blind this hand.\n\nNow analyzing my situation:\n- **Hand**: 9d 8c (suited connector, off-suit)\n- **Position**: UTG (worst position)\n- **Stack**: 262 chips (65.5 BB)\n- **Blinds**: 2/4\n- **To call**: 4 chips\n\nWith 9-8 offsuit from UTG position, this is a marginal hand at best. I need to consider:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 9-8 offsuit is a weak hand from early position. It has some straight potential but no suit connectivity. It's easily dominated by higher cards.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be acting first on every street with 4 players left to act behind me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: The players behind me are relatively tight (especially seats 2 and 3), but seat 5 has shown aggression. However, given the tight nature of most players, if I limp in, I might face raises.\n\n4. **Stack size**: With 65.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack and tight opponents, I should be selective. 9-8 offsuit from UTG is not a profitable hand to play, especially when I could face a raise from the aggressive player in seat 5.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: 4 chips to call into a 6 chip pot = 2:3 odds or 40% equity needed. Even against random hands, 9-8 offsuit doesn't have this equity, especially out of position.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold. This is a clear fold from UTG with a marginal hand like 9-8 offsuit. The position disadvantage, combined with the hand's weakness and the potential for facing aggression from behind, makes this an easy fold. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

The only player left to act is GPT-OSS-120B who has called from the cutoff position.\n\nLet me analyze what I know about GPT-OSS-120B:\n- They just called 4 chips (2 BB) from the cutoff\n- Looking at their recent history, they've been fairly active:\n  - Hand 25: Raised to 12 (3 BB)\n  - Hand 27: Raised to 12, then called a raise to 24, but folded on the flop\n  - Hand 28: Checked from BB, then folded on flop\n  - Hand 29: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 24: Folded preflop\n\nSo they seem to be playing a somewhat loose/aggressive style with selective aggression. Their call from the cutoff suggests they have a decent but not premium hand.\n\nPosition: I'm in the SB, which is the worst position post-flop. I'll be acting first on every street.\n\nStack: I have 256 chips (64 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win a pot of 10 chips (5:1 odds). While the pot odds are decent, my hand is extremely weak and I'll be out of position.\n\nConclusion: With 2-9 offsuit from the SB against a caller who has position on me, this is a clear fold. Even though it's only 2 chips to call (0.5 BB), playing this hand out of position with such a weak holding will cost me more chips post-flop than I'll win. The implied odds are terrible with this hand.\n\nI should fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - Best position\n- Cards: 3d 9c - Very weak hand, unsuited, not connected, low cards\n- Stack: 256 chips (64 BB) - Healthy stack\n- Pot: 6 chips (2 from SB, 4 from BB)\n- To call: 4 chips\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 in SB): Very tight, has folded preflop 6 times in a row, only saw one hand (Hand 30) where they checked through to showdown with 9h Jc on a Ks 2s 8s 6s 8c board. Seems very passive and tight.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB): Also very tight, has folded 8 out of last 10 hands preflop, only raised once (Hand 23) with a 12 chip raise. No showdown data.\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 3d 9c is trash. It's in the bottom 20% of starting hands. No suitedness, no connectivity, low card values.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is great, but with this hand it's not enough to justify playing.\n\n3. **Opponents**: Both opponents are playing very tight. The SB has folded 6 times in a row preflop. The BB has folded 8 out of 10 times. This suggests I might have some fold equity if I raise.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 to win 6, which is 1.5:1. This is not relevant since my hand is so weak.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 64 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take risks with garbage hands. Even though I have position and the blinds seem tight, 3-9 offsuit is just too weak to play.\n\n6. **Stealing opportunity**: Since both opponents are tight, I could consider a steal raise. However, with 3-9 offsuit, if I get called I'm in terrible shape post-flop. The risk/reward isn't worth it.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold. This hand is simply too weak to play even with good position against tight opponents. I should wait for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My Hand:** 3s 3h (pocket 3s) - a low pocket pair\n**Position:** UTG (Under the Gun) - worst position, acting first\n**Stack:** 256 chips (64 BB) - healthy stack\n**Blinds:** 2/4\n**Pot:** 6 chips\n**To call:** 4 chips\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Pocket 3s are a small pocket pair. In early position, this is a very marginal hand. We're looking to hit a set (3 on the flop) which happens about 12% of the time.\n\n2. **Position:** UTG is the worst position. If I call or raise, I have to act first on every street with a weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** From the recall data, I can see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 raised from seat 4 in hand 29 to 8 chips (2x BB)\n   - Kimi-K2 raised from seat 2 in hand 31 to 12 chips (3x BB)\n   - Generally tight play with many folds\n\n4. **Tournament considerations:** With 64 BB, I have a healthy stack. Pocket pairs can be good for set-mining, but from UTG position, it's risky.\n\n5. **Set mining:** The rule of thumb is you need about 15:1 implied odds to set mine profitably. Here, I'm risking 4 chips to potentially win a much larger pot, but from UTG position, it's hard to realize that value.\n\n6. **Raise sizing:** If I were to raise, I'd need to raise to at least 8 chips (min), but likely 12-16 to make it meaningful. This commits too many chips with a weak hand.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. Pocket 3s from UTG is a clear fold. The position disadvantage combined with the low pair makes this an easy fold. I don't want to invest chips with such a marginal hand when I'll be out of position throughout the hand.",

This is a marginal hand but playable in position, especially against a single opponent who just limped from the SB.\n\n**Position:** I have position (on the button) which is a huge advantage.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nLooking at their recent actions:\n- They fold a LOT preflop (hands 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 29, 31, 32)\n- When they do enter pots, they sometimes limp/call (hand 30) or raise (hands 25, 27)\n- In hand 27 they raised to 12, then called a 3-bet to 24, then checked and folded on flop\n- In hand 30 they called 4, then checked down all streets\n\nThis suggests they're playing tight but not ultra-tight. They limp with some hands and raise with others. When they face aggression, they sometimes fold.\n\n**My Options:**\n1. **Check** - See a free flop with my marginal hand\n2. **Raise** - Try to take it down preflop or play a bigger pot in position\n\nGiven I have position and a hand that can flop well (suited connector - wait, it's offsuit, but still connected), checking is reasonable. However, raising could be good because:\n- I'm in position\n- Opponent limped which often indicates weakness\n- I can represent a strong hand\n- If they call, I have position and can control the pot\n\n\n- A standard raise of 3x-4x the big blind (12-16 chips) would be appropriate here\n\nI'll go with a 12-chip raise, which is a standard 3x the big blind. This sizing puts pressure on my opponent while keeping the pot manageable if they decide to call. The raise represents strength and takes advantage of my position, giving me control over the hand's progression.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** Qs Th (Queen of spades, Ten of hearts)\n**Position:** SB (Small Blind)\n**Stack:** 256 chips (64 BB)\n**Board:** 5c 9c 6d\n**Pot:** 12 chips\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Preflop: I called 2 chips (half of SB), BB checked, and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called 4\n- It's checked to me on the flop\n- I can check or raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have Qs Th on a 5c 9c 6d board\n- This is a very dry, rainbow flop with no flush draw\n- I have no pair, no straight draw (need 7-8 for straight, or J-K for straight with my Q-T)\n- I have two overcards (Q and T)\n- Essentially, I have 6 outs (3 Queens + 3 Tens) = ~24% equity on the turn\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nGPT-OSS-120B has been playing relatively tight/passive:\n- Mostly folding preflop (folded in hands 29, 31, 32)\n- When they call preflop, they tend to check down (hand 30: called preflop, then check/check/check on flop/turn/river)\n- They folded on flop in hand 28\n- They called 2 in hand 34 then folded\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is likely to have a marginal hand when they just call preflop. They could have:\n- Small pocket pairs (22-88)\n- Some suited connectors\n- Maybe some broadway cards\n- Ace-high hands\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm out of position (SB) which is a disadvantage\n- I have a healthy stack of 64 BB\n- The pot is small (12 chips)\n\n**Decision:**\nI have two overcards on a dry board. Given that:\n1. The board is very dry (no draws)\n2. I have 6 outs (~24% chance to hit on turn)\n\n\n3. I'm out of position\n4. Opponent seems passive and likely to have missed this board\n5. I can represent a strong hand with a small bet\n\nA strategic probe bet could be effective. I'll make a small 8-chip bet (2/3 pot) to test opponent's strength. This sizing puts pressure on marginal hands while risking minimal chips. If they call or raise, I'm likely behind and can easily fold. The bet serves multiple purposes: gathering information, potentially taking down the pot immediately, and setting up future street decisions.",

I have some equity with my gutshot and potential second pair draw, but it's not strong enough to bet again. I want to:\n1. Pot control - don't build a bigger pot with a weak hand\n2. See a free river card to realize my equity\n3. Avoid getting raised and having to fold my draws\n\nI'll check and evaluate the river card.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm in SB with Qs Th\n- Stack: 248 chips (62 BB)\n- Board: 5c 9c 6d Kd\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- Facing a bet of 12 from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)\n\n**My hand:** I have Qs Th. On this board, I have:\n- No pair (Q high)\n- No flush draw (only one spade)\n- No straight draw (I need a J for a straight, but that would be Q-J-T-9-8, which isn't possible with the board cards)\n- Basically just Q high\n\n**Board texture:** 5c 9c 6d Kd\n- Two clubs, so flush draw possible\n- King on the turn - this is a scary card for many hands\n- Pretty coordinated board with potential straight draws (7-8 would make a straight)\n\n**Action history:**\n- Preflop: I called from SB, BB checked, Seat 5 called\n- Flop (5c 9c 6d): I bet 8, both opponents called\n- Turn (Kd): I checked, BB checked, Seat 5 bet 12\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively passive:\n- Folds frequently preflop\n- When they do see flops, they often check/fold\n- In hand 30, they called preflop, then checked all streets\n- They seem to be a relatively tight/passive player\n\nThe turn bet of 12 into a 48 pot is a 1/4 pot bet. This could be:\n- A value bet with a King\n- A semi-bluff with a club flush draw\n- A pure bluff\n- A weak pair trying to protect\n\n**My situation:**\n- I have absolutely nothing but Q high\n- The King is a terrible card for me - it hits many hands that would call preflop (Kx hands)\n- I c-bet the flop and got two callers, which suggests some strength\n- The turn check from me and BB, followed by a bet from Seat 5, suggests they have something\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 12 to win 60 (48+12), which is 20% equity needed. Even if my opponent is bluffing sometimes, I don't think I have enough equity with Q high.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 62 BB, which is a healthy stack. I don't need to make marginal calls here. Folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\nGiven that I have no draw, no pair, and the King is a scary card that likely helped someone, and I have two opponents who called my flop c-bet, I should fold here. The opponent who is betting the turn (GPT-OSS-120B) has shown to be relatively passive in the past, so a turn bet likely indicates some strength.\n\nMy flop c-bet was reasonable, but when I get called in two spots and the turn brings a King, I should give up with my weak hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: Ts Qh - Queen-Ten offsuit. This is a decent but not premium hand. It has good playability but can be dominated.\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - This is excellent position, the best at the table.\n\n**Stack**: 248 chips (62 BB) - Healthy stack size.\n\n**Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 12 chips (3x BB). I need to call 12.\n\nLet me analyze the opponent's tendencies based on the data I just retrieved:\n\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's 20 most recent actions:\n- They raise to 12 chips frequently (hands 25, 27)\n- They sometimes call preflop (hands 27, 30, 35)\n- They fold a lot when faced with pressure (hand 26 preflop, 27 postflop, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34)\n- They seem to play somewhat passively postflop (checking often in hands 27, 28, 30)\n- They do occasionally bet postflop (hand 35 turn)\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is playing fairly straightforward and possibly a bit tight/passive. They make standard raises but often give up when facing resistance.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 12 to win 18 (4 from blinds + 12 from raise + 2 from SB). That's 12/30 = 40% of the pot, which means I need ~30% equity to call (since there's still money behind).\n\n**Hand equity**: QTo on the button vs a standard opening range (say 15-20% of hands) has roughly 45-50% equity. So from a pure equity standpoint, this is a clear call.\n\n**Position advantage**: Being on the button means I'll act last on all postflop streets, which is a huge advantage with a speculative hand like QTo.\n\n**Stack considerations**: I'm not committed yet. Calling 12 from 248 leaves me with 236 chips. \n\nLet me consider my options:\n\n1. **Fold**: Too tight. I have a playable hand in great position with good pot odds.\n\n2. **Call**: Standard play. I have position, decent hand, good pot odds, and my opponent seems straightforward. I can see a flop and evaluate.\n\n3. **Raise**: Could be considered as a squeeze/re-steal. However, given the opponent's tendency to fold to pressure, a raise might get them to fold hands we're ahead of, and we'd risk 20+ chips. Also, we don't have great information about how they respond to 3-bets.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have position\n- I have a playable hand with good equity\n- Pot odds are good\n- Opponent seems straightforward and may fold to pressure postflop\n- My hand plays well postflop in position\n\nI think calling is the best option. Raising is too aggressive with QTo, and folding is too tight. I want to see a flop in position and outplay my opponent postflop.\n\nLet me make the call.",

In hand 35, they called on the flop then folded on the turn after checking.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I have Qh Ts on a board of 4d 2d 4h Kd\n- Pot is 80 chips\n- I have 216 chips (54 BB)\n- Board shows a possible flush draw (3 diamonds), and I have the Ts (not a diamond)\n- I have top pair with Q on a K-high board - I'm losing to any K\n- Opponent checked to me\n\nLet me analyze this:\n1. Hand strength: I have Q-high, which is not great on a K-high board. Any K beats me. The board is paired (4s), so there are possible full houses. The 3 diamonds mean possible flushes.\n2. Position: I'm on the button, which is good\n3. Opponent: Based on the history, Kimi-K2 is passive and folds frequently. They called on the flop after I bet, suggesting they might have something but not strong enough to bet themselves.\n4. Pot odds: The pot is 80, and I can check for free or bet\n5. Tournament: We're still relatively deep at 54 BB\n\nThe opponent called my flop bet of 20 into a pot of 28 (preflop 12+12+4=28), so they called 20 into 48, which is about 42% pot odds. They could have:\n- A flush draw (any diamond)\n- A K with weak kicker\n- A pocket pair\n- A 4 (trip 4s)\n- Straight draw (A3, 35)\n\nNow the Kd came on the turn, which is a scare card. If they had a flush draw, they just hit it. If they had a K, they now have top pair. But they checked to me.\n\nGiven their passive nature and the check on the turn, I should probably check behind. Betting would be a bluff since I have no showdown value against a K or any pair. Checking allows me to see the river for free and hope to improve to a Q that might win if they have nothing.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I have Q-high. That's very weak on this board. The opponent called the flop bet, which could mean:\n1. They have a hand they're continuing with\n2. They have a draw\n3. They're floating with air\n\nGiven that they checked the turn, if I bet now, I might get them to fold some weaker hands. But what am I trying to accomplish? I have no real equity here. I should probably just check and give up unless I improve.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The opponent is passive. They called flop, checked turn. This is a good spot for a continuation bet on the turn (double barrel) because:\n1. The Kd is a scare card that hits many hands they might have called with\n\n\n2. My opponent's passive tendencies create an opportunity\n3. A well-timed bet could exploit their weakness\n\nThe opponent's consistent folding pattern suggests they're likely to retreat from confrontation. By applying pressure, I can potentially force them to abandon marginal hands. However, I must carefully assess the risk-reward ratio of this aggressive move.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Board: 4d 2d 4h Kd 8d (four diamonds on board, including Kd and 8d on river)\n- My hand: Ts Qh (no pair, no flush, just ten-high)\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- I'm on the button\n- Only opponent left: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)\n- Action: Seat 2 checked to me\n\n**Board analysis:**\n- Four diamonds on board: 4d, 2d, Kd, 8d\n- Any opponent with any diamond has a flush\n- The board is paired (4s), but only once\n- I have no showdown value with Ts Qh\n\n**Opponent analysis from memory:**\nLooking at the opponent actions, Seat 2 has been:\n- Folding a lot preflop (many folds)\n- When they do play, they check-call on the flop in hand #35\n- In hand #30, they showed down 9h Jc on a board with 4 spades (Ks 2s 8s 6s 8c) - they called down with just a jack-high\n\nThis suggests Seat 2 is a calling station who will call with weak hands, even on dangerous boards.\n\n**Action in this hand:**\n- Preflop: Called my 12 chip raise\n- Flop (4d 2d 4h): Checked, I bet 20, they called\n- Turn (Kd): Checked to me, I checked\n- River (8d): They checked to me\n\nThe turn check from me was likely weak, and now they checked again. They called the flop bet on a paired board with two diamonds, so they could have:\n- A weak made hand (pair, two pair)\n- A flush draw that just got there\n- A straight draw\n- Air\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check: Showdown with ten-high, which likely loses\n2. Bet as a bluff: Try to get them to fold better hands\n\nGiven that this opponent seems to call with weak hands (like J9 on a 4-flush board in hand #30), bluffing is dangerous. However, the four diamonds on board is very scary. \n\nBut wait - let me reconsider. The opponent called on the flop when there were just two diamonds. They might have had:\n- A weak pair\n- A draw\n- Some random hand\n\nNow with four diamonds, if they don't have a diamond, they likely can't call a bet. But based on their showdown in hand #30, they called with J-high on a 4-flush board. That suggests they're not easily scared.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI have zero showdown value. Betting would be pure bluff. Given the opponent's tendency to call with weak hands (as shown in hand #30), this is not a good bluffing spot. I should check and give up.\n\nThe opponent's check could mean weakness, but it could also mean they have a weak made hand or a flush and are trying to induce a bluff. Given their calling station tendencies, I don't want to bluff.\n\nI'll check and likely lose, but preserve my chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent data for GPT-OSS-120B in seat 5:\n\n1. They showed down Kh5h in hand 30 - so they play some weaker broadway hands\n2. In hand 35 they called preflop, called flop, then bet turn - showing some postflop aggression\n3. In hand 36 they raised preflop to 12, then checked and folded on flop - so their preflop raises don't always connect\n4. Overall they seem moderately aggressive but not overly loose\n\nNow analyzing my situation:\n- Hand: 4d 7s - complete trash, offsuit, gapper, low cards\n- Position: CO - decent position but not great\n- Stack: 216 chips (54 BB) - healthy stack\n- Facing a raise to 12 (3x BB)\n- Pot odds: 18 in pot, need to call 12 = 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed\n\nWith 4-7 offsuit, I have terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a random hand, 4-7o only has about 38% equity, and against a typical raising range it's much worse (likely 20-25%).\n\nThis is a clear fold. I don't need to risk 12 chips with such a weak hand, especially when I have a healthy stack and can wait for better spots. The opponent's raise suggests they have a real hand, and even if they're bluffing sometimes, 4-7o has very little playability postflop.\n\nThe only consideration might be if I wanted to 3-bet bluff, but:\n1. My hand has no blockers\n2. I'm in CO, not the best bluffing position\n3. 4-7o has terrible postflop playability if called\n4. I have a healthy stack and don't need to take high-variance spots\n\nThis is an easy fold.",

Even suited, it's:\n   - Very low card values\n   - Poor straight potential (9-2 gap)\n   - Flush potential is marginal at best\n   - Easily dominated by most hands\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG, which is the worst position. I'll be acting first on every street with many players behind me. This increases risk significantly.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 54 BB, which is a decent stack but not deep enough to play marginal hands from early position. I should be selective.\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should preserve my chips and wait for better spots. 9-2 suited is not worth risking even 4 chips.\n\n5. **Opponent Context**: I don't have specific reads on these opponents, but in general, playing 9-2 from UTG against unknown players is -EV.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. 9-2 suited is in the bottom 10% of starting hands.

This is a weak hand but it is suited and has some potential.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind). Everyone else has folded except Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) who just called the BB.\n\n3. **Stack**: 212 chips (53 BB) - healthy stack\n\n4. **Action**: The SB folded, and MiniMax-M2 just called from what appears to be the CO position (since Seats 2 and 3 folded before them).\n\n5. **Opponent info**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent history, they've been very tight - folding preflop in hands 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, and 38. In hand 32, they checked down and then made a small bet on the river. This suggests they're a conservative player who only plays strong hands.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I have the option to check and see a free flop. The pot is currently 10 chips (2 from SB + 4 from BB + 4 from caller).\n\n7. **Position post-flop**: I'll be out of position against MiniMax-M2 for the rest of the hand.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have a weak hand (A2 suited) but it has some potential\n- I can see the flop for free (no additional cost)\n- My opponent appears to be very tight, so their calling range is likely strong\n- I'm out of position\n- I have a healthy stack\n\nThe best play is to check and see the flop. Raising would be spewy with A2, especially against a tight opponent who likely has a better Ace or pocket pair. Folding is free but we're getting 0% equity. Checking gives us a chance to hit a flush, straight draw, or pair our Ace with a weak kicker (though that's not ideal).\n\nLet me check.",

On the turn, they're checking, which could mean:\n1. They have a marginal hand and are giving up\n2. They have a strong hand and are trying to trap\n3. They have a draw and want a free card\n\n**Position and Stack:**\n- I'm out of position (BB)\n- I have a healthy stack of 51 BB\n- Pot is 24, which is about 12% of my stack\n\n**Decision:**\nI have a very weak hand (Ace-high). The opponent bet the flop strongly but is now checking the turn. This could be a sign of weakness. However, I have no real hand strength and I'm out of position.\n\nMy options:\n1. Check - see a free river card, keep pot small\n2. Bet - try to take it down now, but risk being called/raised\n\nGiven that:\n- I have minimal equity (just Ace-high)\n- My opponent showed strength on the flop\n- I'm out of position\n- There's no value in betting (only better hands call, worse hands fold)\n- Checking gives me a free chance to improve\n\nI should check. This is a clear check situation. I don't have enough hand strength to value bet or bluff effectively.",

For a flush I need 5 cards of the same suit. I have Ac and 2c, and the board has 5c and 3c. That's 4 clubs total. I don't have a flush.\n\n**Wait, let me recount the board again:**\n9d 5c 6s Qs 3c\n- 9d = 9 of diamonds\n- 5c = 5 of clubs\n- 6s = 6 of spades\n- Qs = Queen of spades\n- 3c = 3 of clubs\n\nSo there are exactly 2 clubs on the board: 5c and 3c.\nI hold Ac and 2c, so I have 4 clubs total, which is not a flush. I just have Ace-high.\n\n**Opponent behavior (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the recall data, MiniMax-M2 has been:\n- Very tight preflop (lots of folds)\n- When they do play, they've shown aggression (bets and raises)\n- In hand 28: called preflop, then bet 4 on flop\n\n\n- In hand 32: checked flop and turn, bet 4 on river\n- In hand 29: raised preflop to 8\n\nI'm seeing a pattern of cautious play with occasional strategic aggression. Their actions suggest a player who waits for strong hands before committing significant chips. The betting behavior indicates they might be trying to control pot size or protect a marginal hand. With a tight-aggressive profile, they're likely to have a strong range when they do decide to bet or raise.\n\nMy kicker is weak, and the board presents potential straight and flush risks. Checking seems the most prudent move given the opponent's tight-aggressive tendencies and my vulnerable hand strength.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: Jd Th - This is a suited connector (J10 of diamonds). It's a decent speculative hand that can make strong straights and flushes, but it's not a premium hand.\n\n**Position**: SB (Small Blind) - This is the worst position since I'll act first after the flop.\n\n**Stack**: 215 chips (53.8 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Current action**: \n- Blinds are 2/4\n- Pot is 14 chips (2 + 4 + 8 raise)\n- GPT-OSS-120B raised to 8 (a min-raise from the button)\n- I need to call 6 to see the flop\n- I can also raise to at least 12\n\n**Opponent analysis** (GPT-OSS-120B):\nLooking at their recent actions:\n- They fold frequently preflop (hands 29, 31, 32, 38, 39)\n- They sometimes call (hands 30, 34, 35)\n- They occasionally raise (hands 36, 37)\n- When they do raise preflop, they often continuation bet on the flop but then fold to resistance (hand 36 flop check-fold, hand 37 flop bet-fold)\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is somewhat tight-aggressive but can be pushed off hands postflop.\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: J10s is a decent speculative hand. I have about 53.8 BB stack.\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, which is bad position postflop.\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 6 to win 14, which is 2.33:1 odds. This is decent for a speculative hand.\n4. **Implied odds**: If I hit a strong hand (straight or flush), I could win a big pot.\n5. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B seems capable of folding to pressure.\n\n**Options**:\n- **Fold**: Too tight. I have a decent hand and good odds.\n- **Call**: Reasonable. I can see a flop with a speculative hand. But I'll be out of position.\n- **Raise**: I could make a 3-bet to 12-16 chips. This would give me initiative and potentially take down the pot preflop or on the flop. Given the opponent's tendency to fold to pressure, this could be profitable.\n\nWith a suited connector like J10s, being out of position is problematic. I either want to see a cheap flop or take down the pot preflop. A small 3-bet could accomplish the latter, especially against an opponent who folds to pressure.\n\nGiven that GPT-OSS-120B has shown they can raise with marginal hands and then fold to flop pressure, I think a 3-bet is a good play here. It gives me initiative and I can continuation bet on many flops.\n\nLet me make a raise to 16 (4x their raise). This is a solid 3-bet size that puts pressure on them.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The minimum raise is to 12, which is only 4 more chips for them to call. That's not much pressure. If I raise to 16, that's 8 more for them to call. Given they raised to 8, a raise to 16 seems appropriate - it's a 2x raise of their bet.\n\nBut looking at my stack of 215, raising to 16 is only about 7.4% of my stack, which is reasonable.\n\nLet me go with a raise to 16 to apply pressure and take initiative.",

The pot is 40 chips (16+16+8 from the folds? Let me recalculate: SB 2 + BB 4 + Seat 5 raise 8 + my re-raise to 16 + Seat 2 call 12 = 2+4+8+16+12 = 42... hmm, but it says pot is 40. Let me just trust the pot size given).\n\nI have Jd Th on a flop of Qs 8s 4h.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n- I have an open-ended straight draw (any 9 or K gives me a straight)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (if I hit two more diamonds)\n- I have two overcards (J and T) but the Q is on the board, so only the J is a true overcard\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 40 chips\n- I can check for free, so infinite pot odds to see the turn\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nI queried Seat 2's actions. Let me analyze:\n\n\nSeat 2's playing style reveals a cautious approach. They frequently fold preflop and tend to check rather than bet aggressively. When they do show down, it's typically with strong hands like top pair or better. This suggests they're tight and passive, waiting for premium hands before committing significant chips.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nWith my drawing hand, I have multiple potential outs. The straight draw gives me 8 clean outs, plus potential overcard opportunities. Given the opponent's passive nature, checking seems like the most prudent move to see the turn card without risking additional chips.\n\nThe board texture is moderately wet with a flush draw, but I don't currently have a flush draw. My opponent called a preflop raise, which could mean:\n- A pocket pair\n- A Qx hand\n- A suited connector that hit the flush draw\n- Maybe A8, A4, etc.\n\nGiven that they called my preflop raise from the BB, they could have a decent hand. The fact that they just called (rather than re-raising) suggests they don't have a premium hand like QQ+, but they could have:\n- Qx (QJ, QT, Q9, etc.)\n- 88, 44 (sets)\n- spade draws (AsXs, KsXs, etc.)\n- Straight draws (JT, T9, etc.)\n- Other pairs\n\nSince I have the betting lead and position, I could consider a continuation bet. However, this board likely hits my opponent's calling range. They would call with any Q, any 8, any 4, any spade draw, any straight draw, etc.\n\nMy hand has decent equity with the open-ended straight draw (8 outs = ~16% on the turn, ~32% by the river). Checking is free and I can re-evaluate on the turn.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack of 50 BB. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Decision:**\nI think checking is the best option. I have a drawing hand with good equity, I'm in position, and I can see the turn for free. If I bet, I likely get called by better hands and fold out worse hands. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to realize my equity.\n\nLet me reconsider - maybe a small bet could be good? If I bet small, I might fold out some hands that have equity against me, and I could get value from some worse draws. But generally, with a drawing hand like this, checking is standard.\n\nActually, I have the betting lead from preflop. A continuation bet could be good here. The board is Q-high, which is good for my range as the preflop raiser. I have some equity with my draw. A small c-bet could fold out some hands and build the pot for when I hit.\n\nBut wait -"

          "reasoning_content": "  The user wants me to make a decision in a poker hand.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My Position: BTN (Seat 1)\n- My Cards: Jd Th\n- My Stack: 201 chips (50.2 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 40 chips\n- Board: Qs 8s 4h\n- Amount to call: 0\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Action History:**\n- Preflop: Seat 1 (me) posts SB 2\n- Preflop: Seat 2 posts BB 4\n- Preflop: Seat 3 folds\n- Preflop: Seat 4 folds\n- Preflop: Seat 5 raises to 8\n- Preflop: I (Seat 1) raise to 16\n- Preflop: Seat 2 calls 12\n- Preflop: Seat 5 folds\n\nSo going to the flop, there's me (BTN) and Seat 2 (BB) in the hand. The pot is 40 chips (16+16+8 from the folds? Let me recalculate: SB 2 + BB 4 + Seat 5 raise 8 + my re-raise to 16 + Seat 2 call 12 = 2+4+8+16+12 = 42... hmm, but it says pot is 40. Let me just trust the pot size given).\n\nI have Jd Th on a flop of Qs 8s 4h.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n- I have an open-ended straight draw (any 9 or K gives me a straight)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (if I hit two more diamonds)\n- I have two overcards (J and T) but the Q is on the board, so only the J is a true overcard\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 40 chips\n- I can check for free, so infinite pot odds to see the turn\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nI queried Seat 2's actions. Let me analyze:\n\n\nSeat 2's playing style reveals a cautious approach. They frequently fold preflop and tend to check rather than bet aggressively. When they do show down, it's typically with strong hands like top pair or better. This suggests they're tight and passive, waiting for premium hands before committing significant chips.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nWith my drawing hand, I have multiple potential outs. The straight draw gives me 8 clean outs, plus potential overcard opportunities. Given the opponent's passive nature, checking seems like the most prudent move to see the turn card without risking additional chips.\n\nThe board texture is moderately wet with a flush draw, but I don't currently have a flush draw. My opponent called a preflop raise, which could mean:\n- A pocket pair\n- A Qx hand\n- A suited connector that hit the flush draw\n- Maybe A8, A4, etc.\n\nGiven that they called my preflop raise from the BB, they could have a decent hand. The fact that they just called (rather than re-raising) suggests they don't have a premium hand like QQ+, but they could have:\n- Qx (QJ, QT, Q9, etc.)\n- 88, 44 (sets)\n- spade draws (AsXs, KsXs, etc.)\n- Straight draws (JT, T9, etc.)\n- Other pairs\n\nSince I have the betting lead and position, I could consider a continuation bet. However, this board likely hits my opponent's calling range. They would call with any Q, any 8, any 4, any spade draw, any straight draw, etc.\n\nMy hand has decent equity with the open-ended straight draw (8 outs = ~16% on the turn, ~32% by the river). Checking is free and I can re-evaluate on the turn.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack of 50 BB. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Decision:**\nI think checking is the best option. I have a drawing hand with good equity, I'm in position, and I can see the turn for free. If I bet, I likely get called by better hands and fold out worse hands. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to realize my equity.\n\nLet me reconsider - maybe a small bet could be good? If I bet small, I might fold out some hands that have equity against me, and I could get value from some worse draws. But generally, with a drawing hand like this, checking is standard.\n\nActually, I have the betting lead from preflop. A continuation bet could be good here. The board is Q-high, which is good for my range as the preflop raiser. I have some equity with my draw. A small c-bet could fold out some hands and build the pot for when I hit.\n\nBut wait -",

With my stack size, I should preserve chips for better spots.\n\nLet me double-check my reasoning:\n- 4 outs to the straight (9s)\n- 4 outs \u00d7 2% per out per street \u2248 8% equity by the river (not 16% - I need to recalculate)\n- Actually, with one card to come: 4/47 \u2248 8.5% \n- With two cards to come: ~16%\n\nFor a flop call, I should consider the odds of hitting on the turn specifically since I might not get to see the river for free. So ~8.5% chance to hit on turn.\n\nPot odds require 21.4% equity, I only have ~8.5% on the turn. This is a clear fold.",

Made a big raise on flop in hand 37 (80 chips). Seems capable of playing back.\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB): Very tight! Folded preflop in 6 out of 10 hands shown. Only called once and raised once. This player is clearly tight.\n\nWith T2o on the button facing a tight BB and an active SB, I should fold this hand. Even though I have position, this hand is just too weak to play. I don't want to invest chips with such a poor hand when I have a decent stack.\n\nThe pot odds are poor (1.5:1), and even if I hit a T or 2, I'm unlikely to win a big pot and could easily be dominated.

Ace-King suited is one of the best starting hands in poker.\n\n**Position:** UTG (Under the Gun - first to act) - This is the worst position since I have to act first post-flop.\n\n**Stack:** 201 chips (25.1 BB) - This is a decent stack size, not too short but not deep either.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- **DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB):** Based on recent history, they fold a lot preflop (hands 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41). They only called once (hand 37) and raised once (hand 38). They seem tight.\n- **MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB):** Also folds a lot preflop (hands 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41). Only called once (hand 39) and showed down As4d. They seem tight as well.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** AKs is a premium hand, only AA and KK are stronger. This is definitely a raising hand.\n2. **Position:** Being UTG is bad, but with such a strong hand, I should raise for value.\n3. **Opponents:** Both opponents seem tight and fold frequently. Raising should often take down the blinds.\n4. **Stack Size:** With 25.1 BB, I can afford a standard raise without committing too much of my stack.\n5. **Tournament Considerations:** I should be accumulating chips with premium hands.\n\n**Standard Play:** With AKs UTG, the standard play is to raise. I should raise to about 2.5-3x the big blind. With blinds at 4/8, a raise to 20-24 chips would be standard. The minimum raise is 16, but that's too small.\n\nLet me make a solid raise to 24 chips (3x BB). This should:\n- Build the pot when I have a premium hand\n- Charge weaker hands to see the flop\n- Possibly take down the blinds immediately against tight opponents\n- Set me up for a continuation bet if I miss the flop\n\nIf I just call, I'd be letting weaker hands see a cheap flop and playing out of position, which is not optimal with AK.\n\n**Decision:** Raise to 24 chips.",

This is a marginal hand, but it's suited and has some potential for a flush or straight.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is good position postflop but I have to act first preflop.\n\n3. **Action**: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has called the 8 chip BB. Everyone else folded. I can check and see a free flop.\n\n4. **Pot**: 20 chips (4 from SB + 8 from my BB + 8 from Seat 4's call)\n\n5. **Stack size**: I have 205 chips (25.6 BB), which is a decent stack in a tournament.\n\n6. **Opponent info**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n   - Very tight preflop: folded 3 out of 4 hands (hands 40, 41, 42)\n   - In hand 43, they called 20 preflop, then called 40 on the flop, then folded on the turn\n   - They showed down with K-8 offsuit in hand 4 and A-4 offsuit in hand 39\n   - They seem to be a somewhat passive player who calls rather than raises\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 25.6 BB, I don't want to get into a big pot with a marginal hand like J5s unless I hit something strong. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n8. **Pot odds**: I can check for free, so there's no immediate cost to see the flop.\n\nGiven that I can see the flop for free, I have a suited hand with some potential, and my opponent seems relatively tight/passive, I should check and see the flop. There's no reason to raise with J5s here - if I raise, I'm likely only getting called by better hands, and I'm out of position. Checking gives me a chance to hit a strong hand or draw cheaply.\n\nThe best play is to check and see the flop.",

Now on turn, pot is 48 and I can check or raise.\n\n**Decision:**\n- I have a strong flush draw but it's not the nut flush (Ah would be nuts)\n- The board is relatively dry for made hands - no pairs, no straights yet\n- Opponent called my flop bet which suggests some strength but not necessarily a monster\n- Checking gives me a free card to hit my flush\n- Raising would be semi-bluffing but I'm not sure if that's optimal with just a flush draw\n\nGiven the pot is already 48 chips and I have a decent flush draw, I should check here. I don't want to build a bigger pot with just a draw, and checking allows me to see the river for free and potentially hit my flush.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have Jh 5h with a board of 3h 9d 2h 6d\n   - I have a flush draw (hearts)\n   - I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 4 for a straight)\n   - Currently, I only have Jack high with no pair\n\n2. **Position**: I'm BB (out of position)\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 191 chips (23.9 BB) - decent stack but not huge\n\n4. **Action History**:\n   - Preflop: Seat 4 called 8, I checked\n   - Flop: I bet 14, Seat 4 called\n   - Turn: I checked, Seat 4 bet 14\n\n5. **Pot**: 62 chips, need to call 14\n   - Pot odds: 62:14 or about 4.4:1\n\n6. **Opponent Analysis**:\n   - Looking at Seat 4's history: They've been relatively passive, folding preflop several times, calling rather than raising\n   - In hand 43, they called preflop, checked/called flop, then check-folded on turn\n   - They seem to be a cautious player who bets when they have something\n\n7. **My Draws**:\n   - Flush draw: 9 hearts left (13 total - 4 on board/my hand)\n   - Gutshot: 4 outs (four 4s)\n   - Some outs might overlap (4h gives me both)\n   - Total clean outs: ~12 (9 hearts + 3 non-heart 4s)\n   - Odds of hitting on river: ~25% (12/46)\n\n8. **Pot Odds Calculation**:\n   - 25% chance to hit means I need 3:1 pot odds\n   - Getting 4.4:1, which is good enough for a call\n   - Plus implied odds if I hit\n\n9. **Tournament Consideration**:\n   - I have 23.9 BB, which is decent but not deep\n   - Calling 14 costs me ~1.75 BB\n   - If I hit my draw, I can likely win a decent pot\n   - If I miss, I still have a playable stack\n\nThe opponent's bet sizing is small (14 into 62 pot), which could mean:\n- They're trying to control the pot with a medium strength hand\n- They're betting a draw themselves\n- They have a weak made hand and don't want to face a raise\n\nGiven the pot odds, my draws, and the opponent's passive tendencies, I should call here. I have good equity with the flush draw and gutshot.\n\nHowever, I could also consider raising as a semi-bluff. Looking at the opponent's history, they folded on turn in hand 43 after check-calling flop. They might be capable of folding to pressure.\n\nLet me think about raising:\n- If I raise to 28 (min raise), I'm risking 28 to win 62\n- Need ~31% fold equity to break even\n- Given their passive nature, they might fold marginal hands\n- But if they call, I'm building a bigger pot with a draw\n\nI think calling is the better option because:\n1. I have good pot odds to draw\n2. I keep the pot small in case I'm drawing dead\n3. I maintain my stack size\n4. I can re-evaluate on the river\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The opponent bet 14 after I checked. This is a small bet that could be:\n- A weak made hand trying to get value cheaply\n- A draw\n- Air\n\nGiven my pot odds (4.4:1) and my equity (~25% to hit plus some implied odds), calling is profitable. But I also have fold equity if I raise.\n\nWith a raise to 28:\n- I'm risking 28 to win 76 (current pot + their bet + my raise)\n- They need to fold about 27% of the time for this to be profitable\n- Given their passive nature, they might fold often enough\n\nBut calling is safer and I have direct pot odds to do so. I think I'll call and see the river.",

          "content": "  Let me analyze this river situation step by step.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in BB with Jh5h (jack of hearts, five of hearts)\n- My stack: 177 chips (22.1 BB)\n- Board: 3h 9d 2h 6d 4c\n- Pot: 76 chips\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 with 100 chips\n- I'm first to act on the river\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nMy hand: Jh5h\nBoard: 3h 9d 2h 6d 4c\n\nLet me see what I have:\n- I have a flush draw that missed (hearts: Jh, 5h, 3h, 2h - need another heart)\n- The board shows: 3h, 2h on flop, 6d on turn, 4c on river\n- So my hearts are: Jh, 5h, 3h, 2h = 4 hearts, missing the flush\n- Board: 3h 9d 2h 6d 4c\n- This is a very coordinated board with potential straights and flushes\n\nWait, let me recount the board cards:\n- Flop: 3h 9d 2h\n- Turn: 6d\n- River: 4c\n\nSo the final board is: 3h 9d 2h 6d 4c\n\nWhat do I have?\n- I have Jh5h\n- Board: 3h 9d 2h 6d 4c\n- I have: Jh, 5h, 3h, 2h = 4 hearts (flush draw that missed)\n- I also have a 5, but the board has no other 5s\n- The board shows: 2, 3, 4, 6, 9 with two hearts\n\nStraight possibilities:\n- 2-3-4-5-6: I have the 5! So I have a straight! 2-3-4-5-6\n- Wait, let me check: 2h, 3h, 4c, 6d - yes, I have 5h, so 2-3-4-5-6 is a straight!\n\nSo I have a straight: 2-3-4-5-6\n\n\nI'm carefully evaluating the potential threats on this board. The flush draw missed, but there are still dangerous possibilities. The opponent's betting pattern suggests they might have a strong hand, potentially a higher straight or even a made flush. With multiple straight combinations possible, including higher straights like 5-6-7-8-9, I need to proceed cautiously. The coordinated nature of the board means I could be vulnerable to stronger hands, despite having a made straight.\n\nI analyze the betting sequence, noting the opponent's aggressive turn action. My current straight looks solid, but the potential for a higher straight or flush draw gives me pause. The pot size of 76 chips and my remaining stack of 177 chips create an interesting strategic decision point. I'll need to carefully weigh the risks of betting versus checking, considering the opponent's potential hand range and the board's dangerous texture.\n\nThe opponent's betting pattern suggests some uncertainty, but their call on the flop and bet on the turn indicate possible strength. With multiple potential draws out there, I'm leaning towards a defensive approach. A check seems prudent to control the pot size and gather more information about my opponent's hand strength.\n\nMy straight is vulnerable, and the board's texture indicates potential danger. The opponent's stack size and previous actions hint at a possible medium-strength hand. Checking allows me to manage risk while keeping the pot manageable.\n\nI'll carefully consider my options: checking provides pot control, while a small value bet might extract some additional chips if my opponent has a weaker hand. The key is balancing potential value against the risk of facing a difficult decision if they raise.\n\nMy opponent's previous betting pattern suggests some aggression, but not overwhelming strength. A modest value bet of around 18-24 chips could be appropriate, targeting weaker made hands or potential bluffs. This sizing allows me to gain information while minimizing potential losses.\n\nThe board texture and my straight's relative vulnerability mean I should be cautious. Checking is the safer play, letting me control the pot and potentially induce a bluff from my opponent. I'll prioritize pot control over thin value extraction.\n\nIf I bet, a small sizing around 20-25 chips seems most prudent, giving me flexibility to respond to a raise while potentially extracting value from marginal hands. The key is maintaining a strategic edge without overcommitting to a potentially dangerous board.\n\nI need to consider my opponent's aggressive tendencies carefully. Their check on the flop followed by a turn bet suggests potential strength, but not necessarily a monster hand. Checking allows me"

So I have a straight! 2-3-4-5-6\n- Wait, let me check: 2h, 3h, 4c, 6d - yes, I have 5h, so 2-3-4-5-6 is a straight!\n\nSo I have a straight: 2-3-4-5-6\n\n\nI'm carefully evaluating the potential threats on this board. The flush draw missed, but there are still dangerous possibilities. The opponent's betting pattern suggests they might have a strong hand, potentially a higher straight or even a made flush. With multiple straight combinations possible, including higher straights like 5-6-7-8-9, I need to proceed cautiously. The coordinated nature of the board means I could be vulnerable to stronger hands, despite having a made straight.\n\nI analyze the betting sequence, noting the opponent's aggressive turn action. My current straight looks solid, but the potential for a higher straight or flush draw gives me pause. The pot size of 76 chips and my remaining stack of 177 chips create an interesting strategic decision point. I'll need to carefully weigh the risks of betting versus checking, considering the opponent's potential hand range and the board's dangerous texture.\n\nThe opponent's betting pattern suggests some uncertainty, but their call on the flop and bet on the turn indicate possible strength. With multiple potential draws out there, I'm leaning towards a defensive approach. A check seems prudent to control the pot size and gather more information about my opponent's hand strength.\n\nMy straight is vulnerable, and the board's texture indicates potential danger. The opponent's stack size and previous actions hint at a possible medium-strength hand. Checking allows me to manage risk while keeping the pot manageable.\n\nI'll carefully consider my options: checking provides pot control, while a small value bet might extract some additional chips if my opponent has a weaker hand. The key is balancing potential value against the risk of facing a difficult decision if they raise.\n\nMy opponent's previous betting pattern suggests some aggression, but not overwhelming strength. A modest value bet of around 18-24 chips could be appropriate, targeting weaker made hands or potential bluffs. This sizing allows me to gain information while minimizing potential losses.\n\nThe board texture and my straight's relative vulnerability mean I should be cautious. Checking is the safer play, letting me control the pot and potentially induce a bluff from my opponent. I'll prioritize pot control over thin value extraction.\n\nIf I bet, a small sizing around 20-25 chips seems most prudent, giving me flexibility to respond to a raise while potentially extracting value from marginal hands. The key is maintaining a strategic edge without overcommitting to a potentially dangerous board.\n\nI need to consider my opponent's aggressive tendencies carefully. Their check on the flop followed by a turn bet suggests potential strength, but not necessarily a monster hand. Checking allows me",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent MiniMax-M2 has been relatively passive based on the recent hands. Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have Jh5h\n- Board: 3h 9d 2h 6d 4c\n- I have a straight: 2-3-4-5-6\n- Pot: 76 chips\n- My stack: 177 chips\n- Opponent stack: 100 chips\n\n**Key observations:**\n1. I have a straight (2-3-4-5-6)\n2. The board has 2 hearts (3h, 2h) - no made flush possible\n3. Higher straights are possible: 3-4-5-6-7, 4-5-6-7-8, 5-6-7-8-9\n4. Opponent called flop bet and bet turn - they likely have something\n5. Based on opponent history, they're relatively passive/tricky\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 22 BB, which is a decent stack but not deep\n- Opponent has 12.5 BB, shorter stack\n- Pot is already 76 chips, which is significant\n\n**Decision:**\nI have a straight but it's not the nuts. However, given that:\n- The opponent is passive based on history\n- They called flop and bet turn (could have a pair, two pair, or a draw)\n- Checking might induce a bluff from missed draws\n- Value betting could be good but I risk getting raised by better hands\n\nGiven the opponent's passive tendencies and the fact that I don't have the nuts, I think checking for pot control and potentially inducing a bluff is the best play. This is especially good given that the opponent bet the turn and might continue with a bluff on the river.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. I have a straight and the opponent has shown some aggression on the turn. They could have:\n- Two pair (like 9x, 6x, 4x)\n\n\n- A set (unlikely given the board)\n- A missed flush draw\n- A straight draw that missed\n- A lower straight\n\nI'll go with a strategic check. The opponent's passive nature and potential for bluffing make this a smart move. Checking allows me to control the pot size and potentially extract value if they decide to bet. With my decent but not unbeatable straight, this approach minimizes risk while keeping my options open.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the current situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Jh 5h - I have a flush draw on the flop that missed. My hand is Jack-high with no pair.\n\n**Board**: 3h 9d 2h 6d 4c\n- There's a possible straight on board: A-5 (but I don't have it), 3-7 (but I don't have it)\n- No flush possible (only 2 hearts on board)\n- I have Jack-high, no pair\n\n**Action history**:\n- Preflop: I checked from BB, MiniMax-M2 called\n- Flop: I bet 14, MiniMax-M2 called\n- Turn: I checked, MiniMax-M2 bet 14, I called\n- River: I checked, MiniMax-M2 bet 14\n\n**Pot**: 90 chips\n**To call**: 14 chips\n**My stack**: 177 chips\n\n**Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 with 86 chips left\n\nFrom the opponent actions I recalled:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been fairly passive, folding often preflop\n- In hand 43, they called preflop, called a flop bet, then folded on the turn\n- They seem to be a conservative player\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. My hand: I have Jack-high. The board shows possible straight draws (3-4-5-6, 2-3-4-5-6, etc.) but I don't have a straight. I missed my flush draw.\n2. The opponent has bet on the turn and river after I showed weakness by checking. This suggests they have something.\n3. Pot odds: I need to call 14 to win 90, so about 15.6% pot odds. I need to be right ~15.6% of the time to break even.\n4. My hand is very weak - just Jack-high. \n5. The opponent's betting pattern: they called my flop bet, then bet turn and river when I checked. This is consistent with:\n   - A made hand (pair, two pair, straight)\n   - A bluff\n   - A missed draw trying to steal\n\nHowever, given that:\n- I have no pair, no draw\n- The opponent has shown aggression on turn and river\n- My hand is very weak\n- The opponent only has 86 chips left and is betting 14 into a 90 pot, which is a significant bet relative to their stack\n\nI should **fold**. I have a very weak hand, and even though the pot odds are decent, I have no showdown value. The opponent's betting pattern suggests they have something, and I can't beat even a small pair or Ace-high.\n\nLet me make sure I'm not missing anything:\n- Could I have the best hand? Unlikely. Jack-high is very weak.\n- Could they be bluffing? Possible, but I have no way to know, and calling with Jack-high is just hoping.\n- Are the pot odds good enough? 15.6% is low, but I likely have less than that chance of winning.\n\nThe fold seems clear here.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: 8h Js - This is a marginal hand, offsuit and disconnected. Not a strong starting hand.\n\n**Position**: SB (Small Blind) - This is a terrible position, I'll be out of position post-flop.\n\n**My stack**: 173 chips (21.6 BB) - This is a decent stack, not desperate yet.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Blinds are 4/8\n- GPT-OSS-120B raised to 24 (3x the big blind)\n- I need to call 20 chips to see the flop\n- Pot is currently 36 chips, would be 56 if I call\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Let me look at what GPT-OSS-120B has been doing. From the data:\n- They've been folding a LOT preflop (hands 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44 all folded)\n- They raised in hand 40 to 8 chips (small raise) but then folded\n- They bet 30 on flop in hand 37 but then folded\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is relatively tight and doesn't play many hands. When they do raise to 24 (3x BB), it's likely a real hand, not a steal attempt. They have a short stack of 91 chips (11.4 BB), so they're in \"push/fold\" territory.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 20 to win 36, which is about 1.8:1. This is not great odds for a marginal hand like J8o.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 21.6 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. J8o from SB against a raise from a tight player is a clear fold.\n\n**My action**: Fold. This is an easy decision. I'm out of position with a weak hand against what appears to be a strong range from a tight player. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

J5o is too weak to call a 15.9x BB all-in raise, especially when it would cost me 73% of my stack. Even if the opponent is making a move, I don't have enough equity with this hand. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.",

I have to act first on every street, which is a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 173 chips, which is about 21.6 BB. This is a medium-short stack in tournament play. I need to be careful but also look for spots to accumulate chips.\n\n4. **Opponents**: I should check what I know about the players still to act (seats 2, 3, and 4).\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 12, which is 1.5:1 odds.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my hand history, I've been playing quite tight. I can see:\n\n1. In hand #42, I raised to 24 chips with KsAd from CO and won the pot uncontested\n2. In hand #40, I raised to 16 chips with JdTh from SB and folded to a flop bet\n3. In hand #44, I bet 14 chips on flop with Jh5h and called a turn bet before folding river\n\nMy opponents:\n- MiniMax-M2 seems to call and bet frequently (seen in hands #38, #43, #44)\n- GPT-OSS-120B makes big raises (hand #46 with 127 chip raise, hand #40 with 8 chip raise)\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 seems more conservative\n- The other Kimi-K2 is in seat 2 and seems to play fairly standard\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I'm UTG with 8h6h (suited connector)\n- Stack: 173 chips (21.6 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Need to call 8 to see flop\n\n8h6h is a marginal hand, especially from UTG. It's suited but very low. From early position, I should be playing very tight. \n\nHowever, I have a decent stack size and the players behind me have shown they can be aggressive. Let me think about the pros and cons:\n\nPros of calling:\n- Suited connector that can make strong hands (flushes, straights)\n- I'm deep enough (21.6 BB) to see flops with speculative hands\n- Pot odds are good (calling 8 to win 12 = 1.5:1)\n\nCons of calling:\n- UTG is the worst position - I'll act first on all streets\n- Hand is very weak - dominated by many hands\n- Risk of facing a raise behind me\n- Tournament considerations - I should be tighter in early position\n\nGiven I'm UTG with a marginal suited connector, and I have position disadvantage, the correct play is to fold. This hand is not strong enough to play from early position in a tournament setting. I need to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.\n\nLooking at my recent history, I've been selective and that's good. I should continue that strategy.",

It's not suited connectors (gap between 5 and 9), no pair, low cards. This is a folding hand in most situations.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position, but that doesn't make up for the terrible hand.\n\n**Stack**: 165 chips (20.6 BB) - This is a relatively healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 24 chips\n- SB (Seat 5) posted 4\n- I posted BB 8\n- Everyone folded to SB who raised to 16 (a min-raise from the SB)\n\nI need to call 8 more chips to see the flop.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n- They raise frequently from SB position (hands 36, 37, 40, 45, 46)\n- They made a huge raise of 127 chips in hand 46 (all-in?)\n- They fold a lot too (hands 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 47, 48)\n- When they do raise, they often continuation bet on flop but sometimes fold to pressure\n\nThe raise to 16 from SB is a min-raise (from 8 to 16). This could be a steal attempt or could be a strong hand.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, so 3:1 pot odds. But with 5c9c, I'm very unlikely to have the best hand. Even if I hit a pair, I'll likely be dominated.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 20.6 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. 5c9c is just too weak to call a raise, even from the button. The opponent could be stealing, but I don't have a hand that can fight back effectively. I should save my chips for a better spot.",

This is a medium stack in tournament terms - not desperate, but not deep either.\n\n4. **Opponent**: Only the BB (Kimi-K2) is left to act. Looking at their history:\n   - They've been folding a LOT preflop (folded in hands 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49)\n   - Only raised once in hand 43 (raised to 24 preflop)\n   - At showdown, they've shown Jc-9h (very weak) and Ac-Jh (stronger)\n   - This opponent appears to be tight/passive, folding most hands\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 12 chips (3:1 odds)\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 20 BB, I should be somewhat selective but can take some risks, especially in position.\n\nWith Ace-rag offsuit on the button against a tight opponent who folds a lot, this is a clear raise situation. I want to:\n- Steal the blinds (which are already 12 chips)\n- Take advantage of my position\n- Apply pressure to a tight opponent\n- The minimum raise is 16 chips, which is 2 BB. This is a standard steal size.\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to fold preflop (7 out of 9 recent hands), a raise here has good fold equity. Even if called, I have position and an Ace which could be good postflop.\n\nI should raise to 16 chips (minimum raise). This risks 12 additional chips to win 12 chips, which is profitable given the opponent's folding frequency.\n\nLet me consider if I should raise more. Given I have 20 BB and this is a steal attempt, the minimum raise is appropriate. It keeps my risk low while still applying pressure.",

Only raised once in hand 43. Seems to be playing very few hands.\n- Seat 3 (BB): Relatively active, has folded a lot recently but did raise in hand 48. In hand 43, they called a raise and then bet on flop and turn.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n2h 9c is a terrible hand:\n- Not suited\n- No connectivity (gap of 6 ranks)\n- Low card values\n- Very low playability post-flop\n\n**Position analysis:**\nEven though I'm on the button (best position), this hand is simply too weak to play. The only consideration might be to try to steal the blinds if the opponents are very tight.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n- SB has been extremely tight, folding 7 hands in a row. They might fold to a steal attempt.\n- BB has been more active but still folds frequently. They did defend once with a raise in hand 48.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 21.6 BB, which is a decent stack. I don't need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands.\n\n**Decision:**\nEven though I have position and the opponents seem tight, 2h 9c is just too weak to play. The hand has almost no post-flop potential. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nIf I were to raise as a steal:\n- Minimum raise would be to 16 (2x BB)\n- Risking 16 chips to win 12\n- Need both to fold ~57% of the time to break even\n- Given SB's tightness, they might fold often, but BB has shown willingness to defend\n\nBut with such a weak hand, it's better to preserve chips and fold. The risk/reward isn't worth it with 2h 9c.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2h 9c is an extremely weak, unsuited, disconnected low hand with no playability.

I'll be out of position postflop against everyone.\n\n**Stack Size**: I have 173 chips (21.6 BB). This is a relatively healthy stack, but not deep enough to play marginal hands from bad position.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**: From the recent actions I can see:\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) just folded preflop in the previous hand\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) seems passive (checked through in Hand 51, then folded to a river bet)\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) seems more aggressive (made a river bet in Hand 51)\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With 21.6 BB, I should be selective. A4o from UTG is a clear fold. I don't want to risk chips with a marginal hand out of position. If I call or raise, I'm likely dominated by better Ax hands or pairs.\n\n**Pot Odds**: 8 chips to call, but this is irrelevant with such a weak hand from this position.\n\nDecision: Fold.

The fact that they just limped from SB suggests they might have a marginal hand.\n\n**My decision:**\nWith Ts3d, this is a very weak hand. However:\n1. I'm on the button (best position)\n2. There's only one opponent who limped from SB\n3. I have a short stack (20.6 BB)\n4. The pot is small (16 chips)\n\nGiven my weak hand, I should just check and see a free flop. Raising would be risky with such a weak hand and a short stack. Even though I'm in position, Ts3d has very little potential. I could consider a small raise to steal the pot, but with my stack size, I need to be more selective.\n\nThe best play here is to check and hope to hit something on the flop, or bluff later if the situation is favorable.",

Ten high.\n\n**Board**: 4s 9c 6c - There are clubs on the board, but I don't have a club draw. I have no straight draw either.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN) which is good position.\n\n**Stack**: 165 chips (20.6 BB) - This is a decent stack, not short-stacked yet.\n\n**Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 (SB) - They have 107 chips (13.4 BB), so they're shorter stacked.\n\n**Action**: Preflop they called from the small blind (after I checked as BB), and now they've checked on the flop. The pot is 16 chips.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, I can see:\n- Hand 46: They made a big raise (127 chips, which sounds like all-in or close to it)\n- Hands 47, 48, 50, 51, 52: They folded preflop\n- Hand 49: They raised to 16 preflop\n- Hand 53: They called 16 preflop, checked flop, then folded\n\nSo they seem to be playing relatively tight, folding often preflop. When they do play, sometimes they raise, sometimes they just call. In hand 53, they checked the flop and folded, suggesting they might give up easily when they miss.\n\n**Current situation**: I have nothing - just Ten high. The board is 4-9-6 with two clubs. I have no draw. My opponent checked to me.\n\n**Decision**: I should check. I have a very weak hand with no potential. There's no reason to bluff here as:\n1. My hand has no equity\n2. The opponent might have connected with this board in some way\n3. I have no fold equity with such a weak hand\n4. Checking is free and preserves my stack\n\nThe only consideration might be a small bluff bet since they checked, but with Ten high and no draw, that's just burning chips. I should check and see a free card, hoping to hit a Ten (6 outs) or maybe backdoor something.",

Just ten high on a board with Ace, Queen, 9, 6, 4. No pair, no draw, nothing.\n\nOpponent tendencies (GPT-OSS-120B):\n- From the recent actions, they've been folding a lot preflop (hands 47, 48, 50, 51, 52)\n- They made a big raise in hand 46 (127 chips)\n- Made a smaller raise in hand 49 (16 chips)\n- Called in hand 53 and then folded on the flop\n\nThe opponent seems to be playing somewhat tight/passive. They've checked to me on the river after checking the flop and turn.\n\nGiven:\n1. I have complete air (ten high)\n2. The opponent has shown passive tendencies\n3. There's 16 chips in the pot\n4. I have position\n\nThis is a good spot for a small bluff. The opponent has shown weakness by checking all three streets. The Ace on the river could be scary for them if they have a marginal hand. A small bet might get them to fold hands like 9x, 6x, small pairs, etc.\n\nHowever, I need to consider:\n- My stack is 165 chips (20.6 BB)\n- The opponent has 107 chips\n- Minimum raise is 8 chips\n\nA bet of around 8-12 chips would be appropriate here. It's a small risk for a chance to win 16 chips. That's good value.\n\nLet me bet 10 chips as a bluff. This is about 62.5% of the pot - a reasonable bluff size. If they call, I'm done with the hand and will lose 10 chips, but if they fold, I win 16 chips.\n\nActually, looking at the format, if I want to bet 10 chips, I need to \"raise_to\": 10 since the amount to call is 0.\n\nWait, I should reconsider. Let me think about the board texture:\n- 4s 9c 6c Qd As\nThis is a somewhat scary board. The Ace on the river is a big card. If they had a hand like 9x, 6x, or a small pocket pair, they might be worried about the Ace.\n\nGiven their passivity and the fact they've checked all streets, a small bluff seems profitable. I'll go with a bet of 10 chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the sizing. The pot is 16, so a bet of 8 (minimum) to 12 would be appropriate. I'll go with 10 chips as a solid 62.5% pot bet.\n\nWait, I need to use the correct action format. Since there's nothing to call (amount to call is 0), I should use \"check\" if I want to check, but if I want to bet, I use \"raise\" with raise_to being the total amount I want to put in.\n\nSo if I want to bet 10 chips, I should:\n- action: \"raise\"\n- raise_to: 10\n\nLet me make that decision.",

It's unsuited and disconnected.\n\n**My position: SB** - I'm out of position for the entire hand.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- Me: 177 chips (22.1 BB)\n- BB: 228 chips\n- GPT-OSS-120B (raiser): 91 chips (11.4 BB) - This is important, they're short-stacked\n\n**The action:**\n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 28 chips (4 from me, 8 from BB, 16 from raiser)\n- I need to call 12 more chips to see the flop\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nGPT-OSS-120B has been relatively conservative:\n- Folded 2 hands in a row (hands 51, 52)\n- Called 16 in hand 53 then folded on flop\n- Called 4 in hand 54 (likely BB) then checked down and folded on river\n\nThis suggests they're not super aggressive. Their raise to 16 (2x the BB) from the CO position with a short stack could be:\n1. A legitimate strong hand\n2. A steal attempt with position\n3. Desperation play with a short stack\n\n**Pot odds:** \nI need to call 12 to win 28, so 12:28 or roughly 2.33:1. This means I need ~30% equity to break even.\n\n**My hand equity:** 9-2 offsuit has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against random hands, 9-2o only has about 35% equity, and against a tight raising range it would be much worse (likely < 25%).\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (22 BB)\n- The raiser is short-stacked (11.4 BB) and may be getting desperate\n- However, playing 9-2o out of position is a recipe for disaster\n- If I call and miss the flop (which is very likely), I'll be in a tough spot out of position\n- I could potentially squeeze raise to isolate the short stack, but with 9-2o this is very risky\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. 9-2o is unplayable in this spot, especially out of position. Even though the raise is small and the pot odds seem okay, the reverse implied odds are terrible. I'll lose much more than 12 chips when I hit a weak hand like top pair with a 9 and get outkicked, or when I completely miss and have to fold to continuation bets.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9-2 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker.

          "content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**My hand**: As Ad (pocket aces) - the strongest starting hand\n**Position**: BTN (button) - best position\n**Stack**: 153 chips (19.1 BB) - medium stack\n**Board**: 2c 6s 7s - rainbow with one spade, no straight draws yet\n\n**Pot**: 78 chips\n**To call**: 26 chips\n\n**Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB, who just bet 26 into 78\n\nLooking at DeepSeek-V3.2's history:\n- Very tight preflop (lots of folds)\n- When they do play, they can be aggressive (hand 48 preflop raise, hand 53 preflop raise and flop bet)\n- They seem to bet when they have something\n\nThe board is relatively dry - 2c 6s 7s. There are no completed straights or flushes. The only draws are:\n- 3-4 or 4-5 for a straight\n- Any two spades for a flush draw\n\nWith pocket aces on this board, I have an overpair - currently the best hand most of the time. \n\nPot odds: 26 to win 78, so 3:1 pot odds. This is an easy call, but I should consider raising for value and protection.\n\nI need to think about:\n1. **Protection**: There are some draws possible (spade flush draw, straight draws). I should charge draws.\n2. **Value**: DeepSeek likely has something decent since they called preflop and bet flop. Could be a pair, two pair, or a draw.\n3. **Stack size**: I have 153 chips. If I raise, I need to think about the sizing.\n\nThe minimum raise is to 52 (26 + 26). I could also go all-in.\n\nLet me think about standard raise sizing. The bet is 26 into 78, so about 1/3 pot. A standard raise would be to about 3x their bet or more, so around 78-104 chips.\n\nGiven my stack is 153, a raise to around 80-90 would:\n- Charge draws appropriately\n- Build the pot with my strong hand\n- Not commit my entire stack yet, leaving room for later streets\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 153 chips and the pot already at 78, if I raise to say 90:\n- Pot becomes 168\n- I have ~63 left\n- This essentially commits me anyway\n\nA better approach might be to either:\n1. Raise smaller (like 60-70) to keep the pot manageable\n2. Go all-in now to maximize fold equity and protect against draws\n\nBut wait - going all-in with aces on this relatively safe board might be overkill. The opponent bet 26, which suggests they have something. If I go all-in, they might fold hands I'm ahead of, like 7x, 6x, 2x, or draws.\n\nLet me think about the opponent's range. They called my 3x raise preflop from the BB. That suggests:\n- Pocket pairs (22-QQ)\n- Some suited connectors\n- Some broadway cards\n- Maybe A-x suited\n\nOn this flop (2c 6s 7s), if they have:\n- A set (222, 666, 777): I'm crushed, but that's unlikely with only one of each card on board\n- Two pair (76, 72, 62): I'm behind, but also unlikely they called preflop with these\n- One pair (7x, 6x, 2x): I'm ahead\n- Overpair (88-QQ): I'm ahead\n- Draws: I'm ahead\n\nSo I'm ahead of most of their range. I should raise for value.\n\nGiven the pot is 78 and I need to call 26, if I raise to around 70-80:\n- I'm building the pot\n- Charging draws\n- Not overcommitting if a scary card comes\n\nLet me go with a raise to 75. That's about 2.9x their bet, which is reasonable.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise again - it's to 52 total. That's only adding 26 more. That seems too small. I should raise more.\n\nLet me think about tournament dynamics. I have 19 BB, which is a decent stack but not huge. I don't want to get into a tricky spot on later streets. With aces, I want to get value now.\n\nA good sizing would be to raise to about 75-85 total. Let me go with 78 to match the pot size, or maybe a bit more.\n\nActually, let me be more aggressive. The board has some draw potential. I should charge them. I'll raise to 80 total.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. If I"

          "content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**My hand**: As Ad (pocket aces) - the strongest starting hand\n**Position**: BTN (button) - best position\n**Stack**: 153 chips (19.1 BB) - medium stack\n**Board**: 2c 6s 7s - rainbow with one spade, no straight draws yet\n\n**Pot**: 78 chips\n**To call**: 26 chips\n\n**Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB, who just bet 26 into 78\n\nLooking at DeepSeek-V3.2's history:\n- Very tight preflop (lots of folds)\n- When they do play, they can be aggressive (hand 48 preflop raise, hand 53 preflop raise and flop bet)\n- They seem to bet when they have something\n\nThe board is relatively dry - 2c 6s 7s. There are no completed straights or flushes. The only draws are:\n- 3-4 or 4-5 for a straight\n- Any two spades for a flush draw\n\nWith pocket aces on this board, I have an overpair - currently the best hand most of the time. \n\nPot odds: 26 to win 78, so 3:1 pot odds. This is an easy call, but I should consider raising for value and protection.\n\nI need to think about:\n1. **Protection**: There are some draws possible (spade flush draw, straight draws). I should charge draws.\n2. **Value**: DeepSeek likely has something decent since they called preflop and bet flop. Could be a pair, two pair, or a draw.\n3. **Stack size**: I have 153 chips. If I raise, I need to think about the sizing.\n\nThe minimum raise is to 52 (26 + 26). I could also go all-in.\n\nLet me think about standard raise sizing. The bet is 26 into 78, so about 1/3 pot. A standard raise would be to about 3x their bet or more, so around 78-104 chips.\n\nGiven my stack is 153, a raise to around 80-90 would:\n- Charge draws appropriately\n- Build the pot with my strong hand\n- Not commit my entire stack yet, leaving room for later streets\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 153 chips and the pot already at 78, if I raise to say 90:\n- Pot becomes 168\n- I have ~63 left\n- This essentially commits me anyway\n\nA better approach might be to either:\n1. Raise smaller (like 60-70) to keep the pot manageable\n2. Go all-in now to maximize fold equity and protect against draws\n\nBut wait - going all-in with aces on this relatively safe board might be overkill. The opponent bet 26, which suggests they have something. If I go all-in, they might fold hands I'm ahead of, like 7x, 6x, 2x, or draws.\n\nLet me think about the opponent's range. They called my 3x raise preflop from the BB. That suggests:\n- Pocket pairs (22-QQ)\n- Some suited connectors\n- Some broadway cards\n- Maybe A-x suited\n\nOn this flop (2c 6s 7s), if they have:\n- A set (222, 666, 777): I'm crushed, but that's unlikely with only one of each card on board\n- Two pair (76, 72, 62): I'm behind, but also unlikely they called preflop with these\n- One pair (7x, 6x, 2x): I'm ahead\n- Overpair (88-QQ): I'm ahead\n- Draws: I'm ahead\n\nSo I'm ahead of most of their range. I should raise for value.\n\nGiven the pot is 78 and I need to call 26, if I raise to around 70-80:\n- I'm building the pot\n- Charging draws\n- Not overcommitting if a scary card comes\n\nLet me go with a raise to 75. That's about 2.9x their bet, which is reasonable.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise again - it's to 52 total. That's only adding 26 more. That seems too small. I should raise more.\n\nLet me think about tournament dynamics. I have 19 BB, which is a decent stack but not huge. I don't want to get into a tricky spot on later streets. With aces, I want to get value now.\n\nA good sizing would be to raise to about 75-85 total. Let me go with 78 to match the pot size, or maybe a bit more.\n\nActually, let me be more aggressive. The board has some draw potential. I should charge them. I'll raise to 80 total.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. If I"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My position: BTN (Seat 1)\n- My cards: As Ad (pocket aces!)\n- My stack: 78 chips (9.8 BB)\n- Board: 2c 6s 7s 2s\n- Pot: 202 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (DeepSeek-V3.2 checked)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have pocket aces on a board of 2c 6s 7s 2s. This is a very strong hand, but the board is concerning:\n- There are two 2s, so full houses are possible\n- Three spades (6s, 7s, 2s) means a flush draw is out there\n- The board is somewhat coordinated with 6-7\n\nHowever, I still have a very strong hand. Let me think about the betting:\n- Preflop: I raised to 24, DeepSeek-V3.2 called\n- Flop: DeepSeek-V3.2 bet 26, I raised to 75, they called 49\n- Turn: DeepSeek-V3.2 checked\n\nThe fact that they bet on the flop and then checked the turn suggests they might have been on a draw or have a medium-strength hand. They could have:\n- A flush draw (spades)\n- A straight draw\n- A pair (like 6x, 7x)\n- Or they could have a monster and be trapping\n\n**My stack situation:**\nI only have 78 chips left, and the pot is 202 chips. This is a critical tournament situation. I have about 9.8 BB left.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the search results, I can see DeepSeek-V3.2 has been fairly active. They:\n- Raised preflop in hand 48 with unknown cards\n- Called preflop in hand 52 with A4\n- Raised preflop in hand 53 with unknown cards and made a 35 chip bet on the flop\n- Folded multiple times as well\n\nThey seem to be a thinking player who can both raise and fold.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that I have pocket aces, the pot is already 202 chips, and I only have 78 chips left, I should be looking to get all my chips in. The turn check from my opponent could mean:\n1. They're giving up on a draw\n2. They're scared of the flush\n3. They're trapping with a monster\n\nBut with pocket aces, I can't afford to just check here. I need to:\n1. Protect my hand against draws\n2. Extract value from worse hands\n3. Take down the pot now if they're weak\n\nSince I can only raise to 49 minimum, but I have 78 total, I should just go all-in. This maximizes pressure and gives draws bad odds to call.\n\nLet me check if raising to 49 (the minimum) makes sense vs going all-in. Given my short stack and the pot size, going all-in is much better. If I raise to 49, I'm leaving 29 chips behind which is awkward.\n\nActually, wait. Let me re-read the rules. The \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount I'm putting in. So if I want to go all-in with my remaining 78 chips, I should set \"raise_to\": 78.\n\nBut I need to check if 78 is at least the minimum raise of 49. Yes, 78 > 49, so it's a valid raise.\n\nThe key here is that with pocket aces on this board, facing a check, and with a short stack, I should be betting for value and protection. Going all-in puts maximum pressure and ensures I realize my equity.",

Amount to call: 8 chips (1 BB)\n7. Minimum raise: 16 chips\n\nHand strength analysis:\n- K7o is a very weak hand, especially from early position\n- It's not connected, not suited\n- Even if I hit a King, I could easily be dominated by better kickers\n- If I hit a 7, it's rarely going to be good enough\n- This hand has very poor playability postflop\n\nPosition considerations:\n- From UTG, I need a very strong range\n- K7o is nowhere near strong enough to open from this position\n- I'll be out of position against the entire table postflop\n\nOpponent considerations:\n- I don't have specific reads on these opponents yet, but generally speaking, from UTG I should be playing a very tight range\n\nTournament considerations:\n- I have 35 BB, which is a decent stack - no need to gamble yet\n- I can wait for better spots\n- Preserving my stack is important\n\nThe correct play here is clearly to fold. There's no reason to play K7o from UTG with a healthy stack. I don't need to use any memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold based on fundamental poker strategy.",

They raised to 16 in hand 55 from BB.\n\n6. **My recent history**: Looking at my last 15 hands, I've been playing very tight - folding most hands preflop. I only raised with premium hands (AA in hand 56, A2s in hand 50). This is appropriate for tournament play.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- 3h Td is a trash hand, especially from UTG\n- From UTG, I should only be playing premium hands (pairs, AK, AQ, maybe AJ suited, KQ suited)\n- Even if I hit a T on the flop, I could be dominated by better kickers\n- Even if I hit a 3, I'm unlikely to have the best hand\n- There's no flush or straight potential worth mentioning\n- I'm out of position against all opponents\n- The pot odds are 12:8 (1.5:1) which is not enough to justify playing this hand\n\n**Decision**: Clear fold. This is a standard fold in any position, but especially from UTG with this hand strength.\n\nI should not call or raise with this hand. It's simply too weak and I'll be out of position throughout the hand. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.",

Seems tight. Just called here.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Mixed pattern - has made raises and calls. Made a 4x raise from SB position.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- I need to call 16 to win 40 (2.5:1 pot odds)\n- This is a 3-bet pot from SB vs BB\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 84o is in the bottom 15% of hands. Very weak, no connectivity, suited potential, or high card value.\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position post-flop which is a huge disadvantage\n3. **Opponent raise**: SB is raising into the BB, which typically indicates strength\n4. **Stack preservation**: I have a healthy stack and don't need to gamble with garbage\n5. **Implied odds**: Very low with this hand - even if I hit a pair, I'll likely be dominated\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, I'm out of position, facing a raise, and have no compelling reason to defend with such a poor holding. Even getting 2.5:1 pot odds, this hand has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range.\n\nLet me fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: Kd Jh (King of diamonds, Jack of hearts) - This is a decent but not premium hand. It's suited in diamonds, which gives some potential.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position post-flop, I get to act last.\n\n**Stack**: 268 chips (33.5 BB) - Healthy stack, above 30 BB.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 28 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 raised to 16 (2x the big blind)\n- I need to call 12 to see the flop\n- Minimum raise is to 24\n\nLet me analyze MiniMax-M2's tendencies from the data:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been very tight, folding most hands preflop\n- They raised to 16 in hand 58 (same sizing as now)\n- In hand 59, they called 8, then called 16, then called 30 on flop before folding on turn\n- They seem to play straightforwardly - raises likely indicate strength\n\nSince they've been folding frequently and this is their second raise in recent hands, this raise likely indicates a strong hand range (premium pairs, strong broadway hands).\n\n**My hand equity**: KJ suited is decent but dominated by many hands in a tight player's raising range (AK, AQ, AJ, KQ). I have about 40-45% equity against a typical raising range.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 12 to win 28 chips, getting about 2.3:1 odds. This is marginal with KJ suited.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have 33.5 BB, which is comfortable but not huge\n- The blinds are relatively high (4/8)\n- I need to accumulate chips, but I don't want to get into marginal spots against a tight player\n\n**Decision**: With KJ suited on the button, getting 2.3:1 pot odds against a tight player who just raised, I should:\n1. Fold - too marginal against a tight player's range, risk of being dominated\n2. Call - could be profitable with position and suited hand\n3. Raise - would be aggressive but risky against a tight player\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 is tight and this is a raise (not just a limp), their range is strong. KJ suited is often dominated by their range. While I have position, the risk of being dominated and the marginal pot odds suggest folding is the safest play. However, with 33.5 BB, I can afford to see a flop in position with a decent suited hand.\n\nI think calling is the best option - I have position, a suited hand with good potential, and enough chips to see the flop. If I hit, I can potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Against a tight player who raises, KJ is often dominated. The pot odds aren't great (2.3:1). And while I have position, I'm risking 12 chips (1.5 BB) on a marginal hand. \n\nI think folding is the most disciplined play here. Save my chips for better spots against this tight player.",

Better to wait for a stronger hand or better situation.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the hand:\n\n**My Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (best position)\n- Cards: 2s Qh (offsuit, weak hand)\n- Stack: 268 chips (16.8 BB) - getting short\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Need to call: 16\n- Minimum raise: 32\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n\n**Seat 2 (SB - Kimi-K2):**\n- Very tight player - folded preflop in 6 of last 8 hands\n- Only raised once (hand 57) with 24\n- No showdowns shown recently\n- This is a very conservative player\n\n**Seat 3 (BB - DeepSeek-V3.2):**\n- Also fairly tight - folded 4 of last 5 hands\n- Called once and then bet aggressively postflop in hand 56\n- No showdowns shown\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Q2o is a very weak hand, even on the button\n- Only 16.8 BB left, so we're in push/fold territory\n- From the BTN with a short stack, we could consider raising as a steal\n- However, both opponents seem tight, so they might fold to a steal attempt\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Hand strength: Very weak (Q2o)\n2. Position: Excellent (BTN)\n3. Stack size: Short (16.8 BB) - need to be careful\n4. Opponents: Both appear tight, which favors a steal attempt\n5. Pot odds: Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1) - not great for this hand\n\nGiven my short stack and tight opponents, I could consider a steal raise here. A standard steal from BTN with 16.8 BB would be to raise to about 2.5-3x BB, so around 40-48 chips. But I need to be careful - if either opponent calls or re-raises, I'm in trouble with Q2o.\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\n- I only have 16.8 BB\n- Q2o is a terrible hand\n\n\n- The SB has folded 6 of last 8 hands\n- The BB has folded 4 of last 5 hands\n\nI'll take a calculated risk and attempt a steal. With such tight opponents and my position, a 3x BB raise to 48 chips seems like a strategic move. The potential to pick up the blinds outweighs the risk of a weak hand, given the opponents' tendency to fold frequently.\n\nThe pot represents a solid 9% stack increase, making it a tempting opportunity. However, the tight playing styles of opponents suggest they'll likely only continue with premium hands. My position on the button provides some strategic advantage, but the weak Q2o hand still makes direct confrontation risky.\n\nConservative play seems prudent here. Folding minimizes potential losses and preserves my limited stack for more promising future opportunities. The current hand simply doesn't offer compelling enough odds to justify aggressive action.\n\nI'll fold and wait for a stronger position or more favorable hand dynamics.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- Position: UTG (Seat 1) - very early position\n- Cards: 6h 5c\n- Stack: 268 chips (16.8 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Amount to call: 16\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 6h 5c is a very weak hand. It's unsuited and disconnected low cards. This is a clear fold in almost all situations.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - you have to act first post-flop and there are 7 players left to act behind you. This makes playing marginal hands even more dangerous.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 16.8 BB is a short stack, but not desperate yet. With a short stack, we need to be selective about which hands we play. 65o is definitely not a hand to risk our tournament life on.\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: With 16.8 BB, we should be looking for spots to either shove all-in preflop with strong hands or steal blinds from late position. Playing speculative hands like 65o from UTG with a short stack is -EV.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: We need to call 16 to win 24, which is 1.5:1 odds. Even with these odds, 65o is just too weak, especially from UTG.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. We should preserve our stack for better opportunities.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold based on basic poker fundamentals. 65o from UTG with a short stack is an easy fold, no need to recall opponent tendencies.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The user is asking me to make a decision in a poker hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: 3h Qd (offsuit, very weak hand)\n- Stack: 252 chips (15.8 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 193 chips\n- Action: Seat 3 raised to 169 (which is essentially all-in since they have 0 chips left)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nSeat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has been very tight - folding preflop in hands 57, 58, 59, 60, 63. They raised in hand 61 and called in hand 62 (which they folded on the flop). This suggests they raise with relatively strong hands.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Amount to call: 153 chips\n- Pot: 193 chips\n- Pot odds: 193:153 or about 1.26:1\n- Required equity: ~44%\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nQ3o is a very weak hand. Even against a random hand, it only has about 48% equity. Against a tight player's raising range (like 15-20% of hands), Q3o has terrible equity - likely less than 30%.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 15.8 BB left\n- This is a significant portion of my stack (60% if I call)\n- Preserving my stack is important, but so is accumulating chips\n- However, Q3o is simply too weak to call such a large raise\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. Q3o is trash, especially against a tight player who has shown strength. Even if they were loose, calling 60% of my stack with Q3o would be terrible. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify calling with such a weak hand.\n\nThe opponent has 0 chips left, meaning they're all-in. I need to call 153 chips to win 193. This is essentially a tournament life decision with Q3o. Easy fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent in the big blind (Seat 2, also Kimi-K2) has been playing quite tight. Looking at their preflop actions:\n\n- Folded many times: hands 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60, 63, 64 (11 folds)\n- Called: hand 51 (4 chips), hand 61 (8 chips then folded)\n- Raised: hand 57 (24 chips), hand 62 (40 chips)\n\nThis is a tight player who defends their big blind selectively. They have shown they can fold to steals.\n\nMy situation:\n- Position: BTN (excellent position)\n- Hand: Tc 3c (very weak, offsuit but suited connector - still very marginal)\n- Stack: 244 chips (15.2 BB) - relatively short\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 8 chips (getting 3:1 odds)\n\nWith T3s on the button facing a tight BB, I have a few options:\n\n1. **Fold**: Safe play, preserves stack. T3s is a very weak hand.\n2. **Call**: Getting decent odds (3:1), but I'll be out of position postflop and the hand has poor playability.\n3. **Raise (steal)**: Try to win the blinds now. Minimum raise to 32 chips would risk 24 to win 24. \n\nGiven that the BB is tight and has folded to pressure before, a steal attempt could work. However, I'm risking 24 chips (about 10% of my stack) with a very weak hand. \n\nWith 15.2 BB, I'm in the \"danger zone\" where I need to be careful with my chips. While stealing from the button is generally good, T3s is just too weak to risk 10% of my stack, especially when the BB has shown they can defend with raises.\n\nThe call is tempting getting 3:1 odds, but I'll be out of position and this hand flops poorly most of the time. It's a \"fit or fold\" hand that will often miss completely.\n\nI think the best play is to **fold**. Preserve my chips for better spots. I have a marginal hand and while the opponent is tight, risking chips with T3s when I'm already short-stacked is not optimal.",

Only calls/raises occasionally. Shows 9hJc and JhAc at showdowns (reasonable hands).\n- Seat 3 (BB): More active, mixes raises and calls. Has made some larger raises (56, 169 chips).\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nAh 3d is a marginal hand. It's Ace-high which is good, but:\n- Weak kicker (3)\n- Offsuit\n- Not connected\n- Only 15.2 BB stack (short stack territory)\n\n**Position advantage:**\nBeing on the button is great - I'll act last postflop.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nCalling 16 to win 24 = 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed. This is not favorable for A3o.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nWith 15.2 BB, I'm in short stack territory. I should be selective and look for spots to accumulate chips or preserve my stack. A3o is not strong enough to commit chips with.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. Weak hand (A3o)\n2. Short stack (15.2 BB)\n3. BB player is aggressive and could raise\n4. SB is tight but might defend\n5. Need to preserve chips for better spots\n\nI should fold this hand. It's not strong enough to call or raise with my stack size, especially against an aggressive BB player who might re-raise.",

This means they're in the small blind and will be all-in automatically. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted the big blind with 98 chips.\n\nLet me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 5s Td - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. In UTG position, this is definitely a fold in normal circumstances.\n\n2. **My position**: UTG (first to act) - This is the worst position, so I should only play premium hands.\n\n3. **Opponent stacks**: \n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has only 8 chips and is all-in from the small blind\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 98 chips and posted the big blind\n   - I have 244 chips (15.2 BB)\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 24 chips (8 from SB + 16 from BB). I need to call 16 to see the flop. This gives me 1.5:1 pot odds, which is not great.\n\n5. **Special situation**: Since Seat 3 is all-in with only 8 chips, there's a potential side pot situation. If I call, I'll be competing against Seat 4's 16-chip big blind, but Seat 3 can only win 8 chips from each of us.\n\n6. **Hand strength**: My hand is very weak. Even against a random hand from the all-in player, I'm not in great shape. Against a typical big blind defending range, I'm crushed.\n\nThe key consideration here is: should I call 16 chips to try to win the 8 chips from the all-in player plus potentially more from the big blind?\n\nGiven that:\n- My hand is extremely weak (T5 offsuit)\n- I'm in the worst position (UTG)\n- I have a healthy stack of 15.2 BB and don't need to take marginal spots\n- The potential gain is small (24 chips) compared to the risk (16 chips)\n- I have no information suggesting the big blind is weak\n\nThis is a clear fold. I should preserve my chips for better opportunities. The presence of the all-in short stack doesn't change the fundamental weakness of my hand and position.",

Even with these odds, 9-6 offsuit performs poorly against a strong range\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 14.2 BB, I should be looking for better spots. While I could defend the blind with a stronger hand, 9-6 offsuit is just too weak\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. Even though I'm getting decent pot odds and have position, 9-6 offsuit is simply not a hand I should be defending with, especially against a tight opponent who likely has a strong range. I should preserve my chips for a better opportunity.",

Better to preserve my stack and wait for a stronger hand or better situation to commit my chips.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My hand: 6\u2660 A\u2666 (Ace-6 offsuit)\n- Position: Button (good position)\n- My stack: 220 chips (13.8 BB) - getting short\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- To call: 48 chips\n- Minimum raise: 96 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raised to 56 - they have 0 chips now (out)\n- Seats 4 and 5 folded\n\nWait, the opponent data shows DeepSeek-V3.2 raised in hand #61 with 56 chips, and hand #61 shows I was in BTN with 2s Qh and folded. Let me check the current hand again.\n\nActually, looking at the hand history, it says \"Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 0 chips (out)\" but the actions show they raised to 56. This seems contradictory. Let me assume they're still in and raised to 56.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the recall data, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been very active with preflop raises:\n- Multiple raises varying from 6 to 177 chips\n- Showdowns show they played A6 (which I have now) and KK\n- They seem aggressive preflop\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- A6 offsuit is a marginal hand, especially with a low kicker\n- On the button, I have position advantage\n- My stack is 13.8 BB - this is a critical decision point\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- To call: 48 chips\n- Pot odds: 80:48 or 1.67:1\n- This means I need ~37.5% equity to call\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- With 13.8 BB, I'm in the danger zone\n- I need to be thinking about preserving my stack or finding good spots to accumulate\n- A6 offsuit is not a premium hand, but it's not terrible either\n- The opponent is aggressive, which could mean they're raising wide\n\n**Options:**\n1. Fold - Safest, preserves my 220 stack\n2. Call 48 - Pot is 80, I'd be calling 48 more. After call, pot would be 128, I'd have 172 left (10.75 BB)\n3. Raise to 96 (minimum) or more - This would commit me significantly\n\nGiven my stack size and the marginal nature of A6 offsuit, I think this is a fold. The opponent's aggression suggests they could have a better Ace or any pocket pair. With only 13.8 BB, I should be more selective and wait for a better spot or a premium hand to shove with.\n\nHowever, I am on the button, and if the opponent is raising wide, A6 might be ahead of their range. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, with 13.8 BB, I should be looking for spots to either fold or go all-in. A min-raise to 96 would leave me with 124 chips (7.75 BB), which is very awkward. If I call 48, I have 172 left.\n\nI think the best play here is to **fold**. A6 offsuit is too weak to commit chips with when I'm this short, and I should wait for a better opportunity to get my money in good.",

Seems aggressive with 3 raises in last 4 hands where it acted.\n- **MiniMax-M2 (BB)**: Has been very tight, folding most hands. Only played hand 71 where it called twice preflop but then checked down all streets. Now has only 10 chips left (extremely short stack).\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Td 2d is trash. Worst possible starting hand in early position.\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act on all streets.\n3. **Stack depth**: At 13.8 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I should be very selective about hands I play.\n4. **Opponent reads**: \n   - DeepSeek has been aggressive, likely to defend SB or even raise\n   - MiniMax is extremely short (10 chips) and might shove or fold\n5. **Pot odds**: 16 to win 24 = 1.5:1, which is not enough to justify playing this garbage hand\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With a short stack, I need to preserve chips for better spots. T2s is not a hand I want to play UTG, especially when facing an aggressive opponent in the blinds.\n\n**Decision**: This is an easy fold. T2s is unplayable from UTG with a short stack, especially against an aggressive opponent.\n\nI need to fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent data for Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n\n1. **Preflop tendencies**: They fold frequently (hands 59, 60, 63, 64, 68-73), but when they do raise, they tend to raise to 48 chips (hands 62, 66, 67). This current raise of 48 is consistent with their pattern.\n\n2. **Showdown hands**: They've shown down with Qh Qs (hand 66), Ah Js (hand 67), Jh Ac (hand 36), and 9h Jc (hand 30). So they do play strong hands like pocket queens, AJ, but also some weaker hands like J9.\n\n3. **Current situation**: \n   - I have A\u2663 3\u2660 on the button\n   - Stack: 204 chips (12.8 BB)\n   - Blinds: 8/16\n   - Pot: 72 chips\n   - Need to call 32 chips to see flop\n   - Minimum raise to 80\n\n4. **Hand analysis**: \n   - A3o is a marginal hand, especially out of position (even though I'm on BTN, the raiser is in earlier position)\n   - I'm dominated by many AX hands that opponent could have\n   - Only 12.8 BB left - this is a short stack situation\n   - Pot odds: 32 to win 72 = 2.25:1 or about 31% equity needed\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - With 12.8 BB, I'm in the danger zone\n   - I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call raises\n   - A3o is not strong enough to call a raise with this stack depth\n   - If I call 32, I'll have 172 left (10.75 BB) and will be pot-committed on many flops\n\n6. **Opponent's raise size**: 48 chips is 3x the big blind, which is a standard raise size for them. They do this with both strong hands (QQ, AJ) and presumably some weaker hands.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. A3o is too weak to call a raise with a short stack, and I'm not deep enough to speculate. I should preserve my chips for a better spot, preferably to shove all-in as the first raiser rather than calling off 20% of my stack with a marginal hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 2h 7s (complete trash, unsuited, low cards)\n- My position: Button (best position)\n- My stack: 196 chips (12.2 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Action back to me: I need to call 8 more chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Kimi-K2 in BB):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see:\n- This opponent has been folding a LOT preflop (hands 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73 all folded)\n- But when they do raise, they raise to 48 (3x BB) - seen in hands 67 and 74\n- In hand 66, they had pocket Queens and won\n- In hand 67, they had AJ and won\n- They seem to play tight but aggressive when they enter pots\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n- I'm on the Button, which is great position\n- Everyone else has folded\n- It's heads-up against the BB\n\n**Stack Size Considerations:**\n- I have 12.2 BB, which is short but not desperate yet\n- I need to be careful with stack preservation\n- However, with my position and the opponent's tendency to fold a lot, I could steal\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- 2h 7s is literally one of the worst hands in poker (72 offsuit)\n- Even against a tight opponent, this hand has very little equity\n- If I get called, I'm in terrible shape\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Steal opportunity**: Opponent folds a lot preflop (6 consecutive folds before raising in hands 67 and 74)\n2. **Position**: I have button position advantage\n3. **Hand strength**: Extremely weak hand\n4. **Stack size**: Short stack, need to preserve chips\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 8 to win 24 (3:1 odds), but with this hand it doesn't matter\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Safe, preserve 12BB stack, wait for better spot\n- **Call**: Terrible with 72o, no implied odds, would be burning chips\n- **Raise**: Steal attempt. Minimum raise is 32 (2x BB, or 16 more than calling). If I raise to 32, I'm risking 24 more chips (32 total - 8 already invested) to win 24. That's 1:1 odds. If opponent folds 50%+ of the time, it's profitable.\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to fold 6 out of 8 recent hands preflop (75% fold rate), a steal raise could be profitable. However, with 72o, even if called I'm in terrible shape.\n\nBut wait - let me reconsider. With a 12BB stack, I should be thinking about shove/fold poker. A min-raise to 32 would leave me with 164 chips (10.25 BB). If I get re-raised, I have to fold and lose 32 chips (16% of my stack).\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\n- I've already posted 8 as SB\n- Pot is 24 (8 + 16 + my 8)\n- To call: 8 more chips\n- To raise min: 32 total (24 more than my SB)\n\nIf I raise to 32 and opponent folds, I win 24 chips (increase stack by ~12%).\nIf I raise to 32 and opponent calls or re-raises, I'm in trouble with 72o.\n\nWith such a weak hand, even against a tight opponent, the risk isn't worth it. I should preserve my stack for better spots, especially since I'm on the button and will have good position in future hands.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold 72o. It's one of the worst hands, and while a steal might work given opponent's tendencies, the risk to my short stack isn't worth it. I'll wait for a better hand or a better spot (like when I'm in blind vs blind or have an actual hand).",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand, I'm on the Button with 7h Ts (7 of hearts, 10 of spades). I have 196 chips which is about 12.2 big blinds. The blinds are 8/16.\n\nThe pot is currently 26 chips (8 from SB, 16 from BB, and 2 from Seat 4 who called 2 chips - this seems odd, probably a small blind posted by a player who just entered or something).\n\nI need to call 16 chips to see the flop.\n\nLet me think about this:\n1. My hand: 7h Ts is not a strong hand. It's offsuit and not connected. This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n2. My position: I'm on the Button which is good position, but with a weak hand like this, position doesn't help much.\n3. My stack: I have 12.2 BB which is getting short. I need to be selective and look for good spots to shove or fold.\n4. Opponent tendencies: Let me look at what I found from the opponent actions.\n\nFrom the opponent actions I can see:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3, BB) has been active - they called in hand 72, made a big raise of 184 in hand 73 (likely all-in), and folded in hand 74 and 75.\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2, SB) has been folding a lot preflop, but made a raise to 48 in hand 74.\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) is now out (0 chips)\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) folded preflop in multiple hands\n\nThe action so far: SB posted 8, BB posted 16, Seat 4 called 2 (weird), Seat 5 folded. It's now on me on the Button.\n\nWith 7h Ts and 12.2 BB, this is a clear fold. \n\nI'm on the Button with 7h Ts, a weak offsuit hand. With only 12.2 big blinds, I need to preserve my stack for better opportunities. The hand doesn't have strong potential, and I'd be risking valuable chips on a marginal situation. Folding is the most prudent move to maintain my tournament life and wait for a stronger hand or better position.",

I'm UTG - the worst position\n  2. I would need to call 16 (1 BB) which is 8% of my stack\n  3. I won't realize my equity often enough to justify this call\n  4. If I hit a set, I might not get paid off enough to justify the risk\n  5. I'm likely to face raises behind me\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. Pocket deuces from UTG with a short stack is not a profitable play. I should preserve my chips for better spots, preferably when I'm in better position or have a stronger hand that I can shove with.\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward: weak hand + bad position + short stack = fold.",

Against a typical raising range (like 15-20% of hands), QTo has roughly 40-45% equity. So from a pure equity standpoint, this is a call.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** \n- I'm short-stacked at 11.2 BB\n- I have good position (BTN)\n- If I call, I'll have 148 chips left (9.25 BB)\n- If I fold, I preserve my stack but lose 16 chips\n\n**The raise:** Minimum raise is 80 which would be to 80 total (48+32). If I raise to 80, I'm putting in 64 more chips and would have 116 left (7.25 BB). This seems too committing with QTo.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. Hand strength: Decent but not premium\n2. Position: Excellent (BTN)\n3. Opponent: Seems tight, but the raise size is standard\n4. Stack size: Short-stacked, need to be careful\n5. Pot odds: Good enough to call\n\nGiven my short stack and decent hand with good position, I think calling is the best play. Folding would be too tight given the pot odds and position. Raising would commit too many chips with a marginal hand.\n\nLet me make the call.",

My hand has essentially no equity - just Q-high\n2. Opponent raised preflop and likely has a strong range\n3. I'm out of position for the rest of the hand\n4. My stack is short (9.2 BB) but not desperate yet\n5. Board is coordinated with trips possible and flush draw\n6. Checking is free - I can see if I improve on turn\n\n**Best Play:**\nI should check. I have no made hand, no draw, and the board is dangerous. The opponent's preflop raise suggests strength. With my short stack, I should preserve chips for better spots. Checking gives me a free chance to improve, but I'm likely folding to any significant bet on the turn unless I hit something strong.",

If they have pocket pairs higher than 9s, my Queens won't help either.\n- So realistically, I have about 3-6 clean outs\n- With one card to come (turn), that's about 6-12% equity\n- Even with two cards to come, it's around 12-24% equity\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- I have 148 chips left (9.2 BB)\n- Calling 64 would leave me with 84 chips (5.25 BB)\n- If I raise to 128, that commits most of my stack\n- I'm in a tournament with shallow stacks\n\n**Decision:**\nThe pot odds aren't good enough for my draw.

J3 offsuit is not a playable hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB (small blind), which is one of the worst positions postflop.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 140 chips, which is only 8.8 BB. This is a very short stack in tournament play.\n\n4. **Pot**: The pot is currently 40 chips (8 from SB, 16 from BB, and 16 from the call).\n\n5. **Action**: Seat 5 called the BB. This suggests they might have a decent but not premium hand.\n\n6. **Amount to call**: It's only 8 more chips to see the flop.\n\nLet me consider my options:\n- **Fold**: This is the standard play with J3o. It's a trash hand.\n- **Call**: I could call 8 chips to see the flop. With my short stack, I need to be careful, but the pot odds are decent (40:8 or 5:1).\n- **Raise**: Raising to 32 would be a squeeze play, but with J3o this is very risky and not recommended.\n\nGiven that I'm very short-stacked (8.8 BB), I should be looking for spots to shove all-in with decent hands. J3o is not a decent hand. However, I have some things to consider:\n\n- The pot is already 40 chips, which is about 28.5% of my stack\n- It only costs me 8 chips (5.7% of my stack) to see the flop\n- If I hit a miracle flop (two pair, trips, etc.), I could potentially double up\n\nBut realistically, J3o is going to miss the flop most of the time, and I'll be out of position. With a short stack, I should preserve my chips for better opportunities.\n\nHowever, let me think about tournament dynamics. With 8.8 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I should either be shoving all-in preflop with a decent hand or folding. Calling 8 chips with J3o is not optimal - it's a \"leaky\" play that will cost me chips in the long run.\n \nFolding is the most disciplined move. I'll save my limited chips for a stronger hand that gives me a real chance to double up. With such a short stack, every chip is precious, and J3o simply doesn't justify the risk.",

It's too weak. Even though I'm on the button, this hand doesn't play well against typical calling ranges.\n\nLet me think about what hands I should be shoving with from the button with 8.8 BB. Typically, I'd want:\n- Any pocket pair\n- Any Ace\n- Any two Broadway cards\n- Suited connectors (maybe)\n- Some Kx and Qx hands\n\n8-7 offsuit is just too weak. I should fold here and wait for a better spot. The fact that I'm on the button doesn't overcome the weakness of this hand with such a short stack.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold based on basic tournament strategy with a short stack and a weak hand.\n\nDecision: FOLD",

It's offsuit, low kicker, and doesn't connect well. Playing this from UTG is extremely marginal.\n\n**Stack considerations**: With only 4.4 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. However, this is an UTG position, meaning 4 players are yet to act behind me. Even with a short stack, I need a decent hand to commit chips.\n\n**Pot odds**: The pot is 48 and I need to call 32, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds. This would require me to win at least 40% of the time to break even. With 3c Th from UTG, my actual equity is likely much lower than this.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB) has been folding a lot preflop\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, BB) has been somewhat passive\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been active with raises and bets\n\nHowever, with my position being UTG, I have to worry about all 4 players behind me, especially the deeper stacked Kimi-K2 in Seat 2 with 461 chips.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 4.4 BB, I need to find spots to get my money in good. This is not that spot. I should wait for a better hand or better position. Folding costs me nothing but the blinds, and I can look for a better opportunity when I'm in later position or have a stronger hand.\n\nDecision: Fold. This hand is too weak to play from UTG with a short stack, and I don't want to commit 23% of my stack with 3c Th.",

Better to preserve my short stack for a better spot where I can be the aggressor.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Kc 7c - King-7 suited. This is a marginal hand, not particularly strong but has some potential with the King and the clubs suit.\n\n2. **Position**: BB (Big Blind) - I'm out of position postflop.\n\n3. **My stack**: 108 chips (3.4 BB) - I'm very short-stacked. This is a critical tournament situation.\n\n4. **Current action**:\n   - Seat 5 posted SB\n   - I posted BB (32 chips)\n   - Seat 3 raised to 80\n   - Seat 5 (the small blind) raised to 128\n\n5. **Amount to call**: 96 chips\n   - I have 108 chips total\n   - If I call, I'd have 12 chips left\n   - This is essentially committing my entire stack\n\n6. **Pot size**: 240 chips\n   - My pot odds: 240:96 = 2.5:1\n   - I need 28.6% equity to call\n\n7. **Opponents**:\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Raised to 80 from middle position with 170 chips (5.3 BB)\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Only has 5 chips left after posting SB, so their \"raise\" to 128 is actually all-in for 5 chips total. They posted SB 16, so they must have had 21 chips (16+5). After posting SB, they have 5 left.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the action. Seat 5 posted SB 16, then later raised to 128. But they only have 5 chips. This means they went all-in for their remaining 5 chips, and the system is showing it as a raise to 128 but they can only actually put in 5 chips.\n\nActually, let me reread: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 5 chips\" and \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 128\". This is contradictory. If they only have 5 chips, they can't raise to 128. \n\nI realize the raise notation is confusing. The 128 likely represents the total amount Seat 5 would need to call, not their actual chip count. Despite showing 5 chips, the system indicates a raise to 128, which suggests an all-in scenario. The key is understanding the actual chip commitment and potential pot odds, which remain 240:96 with 2.5:1 ratio.\n\nWhen I call 96 chips, the pot will expand to 336, and I'll have 12 chips remaining. With Kc7c, my hand is marginal against potential opponent ranges. I estimate my equity is likely insufficient against probable strong hands like high pairs or high cards.\n\nMy short stack of 3.4 BB severely limits my strategic options. I need to carefully consider shoving or folding based on potential opponent actions and my current chip position.\n\nThe situation is complicated by conflicting information about Seat 5's raise. Despite the unclear details, my pot odds are 2.5:1, which suggests I need around 28.6% equity to justify calling. However, against typical 3-bet ranges, my Kc7c likely falls short of this required equity.\n\nWith an M-ratio of 1.4, I'm critically short-stacked and must make a strategic decision quickly. The original raiser's 80-chip bet and the subsequent all-in from the short stack create a complex scenario that requires careful analysis of potential hand ranges and tournament survival.\n\nI need to conserve my limited chips and wait for a more favorable opportunity. K7s is not a strong enough hand to risk tournament elimination, especially against unknown opponent ranges. The potential 2.5:1 pot odds are tempting, but my hand's low equity makes this a clear fold.\n\nI'll preserve my 108 chips and look for a better spot to make a move, likely in an upcoming hand where I can be the initial aggressor.",

Going all-in applies maximum pressure and gives me the best chance to double up or better in this critical spot.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: Q\u2660 J\u2660 - This is a strong suited broadway hand, especially in position on the button. Good potential for straights, flushes, and strong pairs.\n\n2. **My stack**: 92 chips (2.9 BB) - This is critically short-stacked. I'm in desperate need of chips and should be looking for spots to get all-in.\n\n3. **Position**: BTN - Perfect position, I get to act last postflop.\n\n4. **Current action**: \n   - SB posted 16\n   - BB posted 32\n   - One player folded\n   - I need to call 32 or raise\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**:\n   - **Seat 2 (SB)**: Kimi-K2 with 461 chips (14.4 BB) - Big stack. Looking at their history, they seem to play fairly standard. They fold preflop sometimes (hands 81, 82), call sometimes (hand 80), and bet postflop occasionally. They've shown down hands like 9hJc, JhAc, QhQs, AhJs, 7cKh - reasonable holdings.\n   \n   - **Seat 3 (BB)**: DeepSeek-V3.2 with 85 chips (2.7 BB) - Also short-stacked. More aggressive based on history. They made a big raise to 80 in hand 82, and have shown aggression postflop with bets on river (hand 81) and turn (hand 82). They've shown down hands like 6cAc, KhKs, Ad6s, Jd2s, 9dJc.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 48 and I need to call 32, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds. This is reasonable for QJs.\n\n7. **Tournament situation**: With only 2.9 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Standard play would be to shove here with QJs from the button, especially against two opponents who are both capable of folding.\n\n8. **Decision**: Given my short stack and the strength of QJs on the button, I should raise all-in. This gives me:\n   - Fold equity - both opponents can fold\n   - Good hand equity if called\n   - Maximum pressure with a short stack\n   - The chance to double up or better\n\nThe minimum raise is to 64, but with 92 chips, I should just shove all-in for 92 total.\n\nLet me verify this is the right move by considering if call could be an option. Calling would leave me with only 60 chips postflop, which severely limits my options. With such a short stack, it's better to take control and apply pressure now with a strong hand.\n\nThe all-in raise is the correct tournament play here.",

Avoid playing out of position with weak holdings\n\nThe suitedness doesn't make up for how weak this hand is. Even if I flop a flush draw, it would be a low flush draw that could easily be dominated.

This is known as a \"trash\" hand in poker. J-3 offsuit has very poor equity against any random hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, which is out of position postflop. This is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) just called preflop. This could mean:\n   - They have a speculative hand (suited connectors, small pairs)\n   - They have a medium strength hand\n   - They could be trying to see a cheap flop\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 5 chips and I can check to see a free flop.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 99 BB, I have a healthy stack. I should be selective with my hands and not get involved in marginal spots.\n\n**Decision**: With J-3 offsuit, I should check and see a free flop. Raising would be spewing chips with a very weak hand out of position. Folding would be giving up a free look at the flop. The correct play is to check.\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools here since this is a straightforward decision and I don't have specific reads on MiniMax-M2 yet.

I have absolutely nothing. No pair, no draw. The board has an Ace, King, Ten, Seven, Eight. I have Jack high.\n\n**Opponent info from recall:**\nMiniMax-M2 has shown:\n- Hand 1: Preflop raise (4), flop bet (8) - aggressive\n- Hand 2: Preflop fold\n- Hand 3: Preflop fold\n\nSo they can be aggressive but also fold preflop. They called preflop this hand but checked the flop. This suggests they might have something marginal or a draw.\n\n**Board analysis:**\n7c 8c As Th - There are straight draws (9-J would make a straight, but I don't have that). There are club flush draws. The Ace is on the board.\n\n**My decision:**\nI have absolutely nothing. I should check this turn card and see what happens. There's no reason to bet with Jack high. I can check and potentially see a free river card. If my opponent bets, I'll likely fold unless it's a very small bet with good odds (which is unlikely given the board texture).\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to bet:\n- As a bluff? Unlikely to work - the board is coordinated with an Ace and straight/flush possibilities. My opponent would likely call with any pair or draw.\n- For value? No, I have no value.\n- To protect? No hand to protect.\n\nConclusion: Check and see the river for free.",

I have second pair with a terrible kicker (3), and there are many hands that beat me:\n- Any club (flush)\n- Any Ace\n- Any two pair\n- Any set\n- Any straight\n\nGiven that:\n1. My opponent has shown aggression when they play\n2. They've checked all streets so far (indicating weakness)\n3. The board is dangerous with a flush draw\n4. I have a very weak made hand\n5. I can check for free\n\nI should check and see if my opponent checks behind. If they bet, I'll likely need to fold since my hand is so weak and there are many better hands possible.\n\nChecking is the optimal play here - it's free and allows me to see if my opponent has anything or if I might win at showdown with my weak pair.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Now let me analyze the situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 9s Qh - This is a decent speculative hand, especially in position (Button). Queen-high with a suited connector potential.\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - Best position at the table, I get to act last postflop.\n\n**Stack**: 202 chips (101 BB) - Deep stack, plenty of room to play.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- SB (Seat 2): Kimi-K2 - Based on history, they've been somewhat active but tends to fold postflop. They've called preflop raises and then folded on the flop in previous hands.\n- BB (Seat 3): DeepSeek-V3.2 - More aggressive player. Made a big preflop raise to 18 chips in hand #2 and followed with a 20 chip bet on the flop. They've been folding more recently though (last 3 hands).\n\n**Pot**: 3 chips (1+2 blinds)\n\n**Action to me**: Need to call 2 chips to see flop\n\n**My recent play**: I've been playing very tight - folded 4 out of 5 hands, won 1 small pot. This is good for my table image.\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. Q9s is a decent hand on the button\n2. I'm deep stacked (101 BB)\n3. Both opponents have shown willingness to fold postflop\n4. I have position advantage\n5. Pot odds: 2 to win 3 (1.5:1) - not great but with position and deep stack, I can see a flop\n6. I can potentially steal the blinds with a raise\n\nGiven I'm on the button with a decent speculative hand, deep stack, and position advantage against two opponents who fold postflop, I should either:\n- Call and see a flop in position\n- Raise to try to steal the blinds\n\nA standard raise would be to 6-8 chips (3-4x BB). Given both opponents have folded to pressure before, a raise has good fold equity.\n\nI think raising is the best play here. It gives me two ways to win:\n1. They fold preflop and I win 3 chips\n2. They call and I have position with a decent hand\n\nLet me raise to 8 chips (4x BB) which is a standard sizing.",

Q6o is not a strong hand and should generally be folded in most situations.\n\n**Position:** I'm in the BB, which gives me position advantage post-flop.\n\n**Opponent analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nLooking at the recall data for MiniMax-M2:\n- Hand 1: Raised preflop, bet flop (likely strong hand)\n- Hand 2: Folded preflop\n- Hand 3: Folded preflop\n- Hand 4: Called preflop, checked down flop/turn/river (likely weak/marginal hand, showed down K8o)\n- Hand 5: Folded preflop\n- Hand 6: Folded preflop\n- Hand 7: Checked preflop, checked flop, bet turn (somewhat passive)\n- Hand 8: Folded preflop\n\nThis opponent seems relatively tight/passive. They call preflop with marginal hands like K8o, and often fold. The preflop call here suggests they have some hand but not necessarily strong.\n\n**Pot odds:** There's 5 chips in the pot and I can check for free. No reason to fold when I can see a flop for free.\n\n**Decision:** Checking is the clear best option here. I have a weak hand but I'm getting free cards to see if I hit something. Raising with Q6o against a tight opponent who called from early position would be burning chips. \n\nI should check and see the flop.",

The small bet sizing suggests they may not be super aggressive.\n\n**Current Situation**:\n- Pot: 5 chips\n- I have bottom pair on a dangerous board\n- No one has bet yet (I have option to check or raise)\n- MiniMax just called preflop from MP position\n\n**Decision Factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Weak - bottom pair with bad kicker on coordinated board\n2. **Board texture**: Very dangerous - flush draw, straight draws\n3. **Opponent**: Passive, unlikely to bet without a strong hand\n4. **Position**: I'm out of position which is bad\n5. **Stack size**: Healthy at 103 BB\n\n**Options**:\n- **Check**: Let opponent see free card, but I have weak hand and want to control pot size\n- **Raise**: Try to take pot down now, but risk getting called/raised by better hands\n\nGiven the dangerous board and my weak hand, checking seems best. I want to see what MiniMax does. If they bet, I can likely fold since my hand is marginal. If they check, I get a free card to improve.\n\nThe only argument for betting would be to protect against draws, but with bottom pair and a passive opponent, it's better to pot control and see a cheap showdown or fold to aggression.",

Checking seems the most prudent approach, as betting would likely be met with resistance from better holdings. The pot is small, so there's minimal incentive to risk additional chips with such a weak pair. \n\nI'll carefully evaluate potential opponent holdings. They could easily have trips, a higher pair, or be drawing to a stronger combination. My best strategy is to show weakness and avoid unnecessary chip commitment.\n\nThe board texture suggests multiple potential threats - a paired board, possible flush, and straight draws. With my limited hand strength, a defensive check is the optimal play.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: Qc 6s (I have a pair of 6s with a queen kicker)\n- Board: Td 6d 7d 7h Ad (three diamonds, two 7s, Ace of diamonds)\n- Pot: 5 chips\n- I have position (acting last) since I'm in BB and opponent is in seat 4\n\n**Board texture:**\n- This is a very scary board with a possible flush (3 diamonds including Ad), possible straight (8-9 for straight), and full house possibilities (777, 777A, etc.)\n- The Ace of diamonds on the river is particularly concerning\n- I have a weak pair of 6s with a queen kicker\n\n**Opponent analysis from MiniMax-M2:**\n- They called preflop in hand #4, then checked all the way\n- They folded preflop in hands #5, #6, and #8\n- In hand #7, they checked flop then bet on turn\n- They showed down Kc 8d in hand #4 (no strong hand)\n\n**Current hand action:**\n- Preflop: They called my BB (2 chips)\n- Flop: They checked behind my check\n- Turn: They checked behind my check\n- River: No action yet\n\n**Opponent's likely range:**\nSince they called preflop and have checked twice, they likely have:\n- Some marginal hand that connected with the board somehow\n- Could have a diamond draw that missed\n- Could have a pair (Tx, 7x, 6x, or smaller)\n- Could have air\n\n**My hand evaluation:**\n- I have a very weak pair that is unlikely to be good on this board\n- The Ace on the river is terrible for me - any Ace beats me\n- Any flush beats me\n- Any 7 has trips\n- Any Tx beats me\n- Only hands I beat are pure bluffs or hands like 22-55, 88, 99\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the scary board and my weak hand, I should check and hope to get to showdown cheaply. There's 0 to call, so checking is free. Betting would be a pure bluff since I have very little showdown value, and MiniMax-M2 has shown they can call preflop and check down, so they're not an easy target to bluff.\n\nChecking is the clear best play here.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**My hand:** Qc 6s - I have a pair of 6s\n**Board:** Td 6d 7d 7h Ad - This is a very scary board with:\n- A flush draw that completed on the river (3 diamonds)\n- A full house possibility (two 7s)\n- A straight possibility (8-9 for straight)\n- The Ace on the river is very threatening\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** MiniMax-M2 has been relatively passive, checking through most streets. They've only bet twice in the hands I can see:\n- Hand 1: Raised preflop, bet flop\n- Hand 7: Checked through flop, bet turn\n\nIn hand 4 they called preflop and then checked all the way to showdown with 8d Kc.\n\n**Current situation:** \n- Pot is 7 chips\n- Opponent bets 2 chips on the river\n- I have to call 2 chips\n\n**My hand strength:** I have a weak pair of 6s with a Queen kicker. Given the board texture, this is extremely weak. There are so many hands that beat me:\n- Any Ace (now has top pair)\n- Any diamond (has a flush)\n- Any 7 (has trips or full house)\n- Any two pair combination\n- Even just a Ten has me beat\n\n**Opponent's bet:** The bet is very small (2 into 7 pot), which could mean:\n1. They're value betting a strong hand but trying to get called\n2. They're bluffing with a small bet to fold out weak hands\n3. They have a marginal hand and want to see if it's good\n\nGiven the opponent's passive nature and the fact that they've checked through multiple times before, this river bet likely represents some strength. However, the small sizing is interesting.\n\n**Pot odds:** I'm getting 9:2 odds (4.5:1), so I only need to win 18% of the time to break even.\n\n**Decision:** Even with good pot odds, my hand is extremely weak given the board texture. The Ace on the river hits many hands, the flush got there, and there are full house possibilities. I have no showdown value here other than a weak pair.\n\nAgainst a passive opponent who has finally decided to bet the river on this scary board, I should fold. My hand is just too weak to call, even with good pot odds.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider the pot odds more carefully. The pot is 7, opponent bets 2, so pot becomes 9. I need to call 2 to win 9. That's 4.5 to 1 odds, meaning I need to win 18.2% of the time.\n\nGiven how weak my hand is and how coordinated this board is, I think folding is correct. A passive opponent betting into this board when I've shown weakness by checking all streets is likely to have something.",

This is their first preflop action other than folding. This suggests they may have a real hand this time.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: T5 offsuit is extremely weak. No suitedness, no connectivity, only one high card (T).\n2. **Position**: Worst position (SB), will act first on every street postflop.\n3. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B has been very tight, folding 8/8 hands preflop. Their call here suggests actual hand strength.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 1 chip to win 5 chips = 5:1 pot odds. While this seems good, my hand has very poor equity against any legitimate calling range.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my chips for better opportunities.\n\nEven with good pot odds (5:1), T5 offsuit from the SB against a tight player who is showing strength by calling (after 8 straight folds) is a clear fold. I'll be out of position with a very weak hand that rarely makes strong hands postflop.\n\nThe only consideration might be to raise as a steal attempt, but:\n- The opponent has shown they're tight and may not fold\n\n\n- Raising to 4 chips with T5 offsuit is a high-risk, low-reward strategy\n- I'm out of position, which compounds the potential losses\n- The tight opponent's call suggests they have a hand they're willing to defend\n\nI'll fold and wait for a stronger hand in a better position. The marginal pot odds don't justify the significant risk of playing such a weak hand out of position.\n\nA cautious approach preserves my chip stack for more favorable opportunities. By folding now, I avoid potential large losses and maintain flexibility for future hands.",

From the recall, I can see that in the previous hand (hand #10), this opponent made a raise on the flop for 8 chips. This is limited information, but it suggests they are capable of betting/raising.\n\nLet me analyze my current situation:\n- Hand: 3d Ac (offsuit, low kicker)\n- Position: BTN (good position)\n- Stack: 205 chips (102.5 BB)\n- Pot: 9 chips\n- To call: 6 chips\n- I have Ace-3 offsuit\n\nThis is a marginal hand. Let me consider:\n1. **Hand strength**: Ace-high with a weak kicker. Not a strong hand, especially offsuit.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position, but that doesn't make up for the weak hand.\n3. **Opponent**: Only one opponent has shown aggression so far (seat 5). The recall shows they raised in the previous hand on the flop, but that's not enough data to establish a pattern.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 6 to win 9, so 6:9 or 1:1.5. Not great odds for a weak hand.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack (102.5 BB). I don't need to take marginal spots like this. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nAce-3 offsuit is a fold in most situations preflop, especially facing a raise. The only exception might be if the raiser is extremely loose and I have them covered, but I don't have enough information to make that determination. Folding is the disciplined play here.",

I'll be acting first on all streets, which is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 205 chips (102.5 BB) - Healthy stack, no immediate pressure.\n\n4. **Action**: I'm facing a 2 chip call (BB) to see the flop. The pot is currently 3 chips.\n\n5. **Opponent observations**: From the recalled actions:\n   - Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) seems aggressive, made a raise from 6 to 20 in hand 11\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) also showed aggression with re-raises\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 and MiniMax-M2 have shown folds\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: Early in tournament with healthy stack. UTG with pocket sixes is a fold in most situations due to:\n   - High chance of facing raises from players behind\n   - Vulnerable to overcards on flop\n   - Reverse implied odds (when we hit a set, we might not get paid enough, but when overcards come, we often lose)\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 to win 3 chips (1.5:1). This isn't relevant for a fold decision here.\n\n8. **Strategy**: With pocket pairs from early position, the standard play is to either:\n   - Fold (conservative, recommended for beginners)\n   - Open-raise (aggressive, but risky from UTG with 66)\n   \n   From UTG, pocket sixes are generally a fold because:\n   - 5 players left to act who could have better hands\n   - If I get raised, I'll likely have to fold\n   - Even if I see a flop, I'll be out of position\n\nThe best play here is to fold. While 66 is a playable hand in late position or against a single opponent, from UTG with multiple players behind, it's too risky. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

It's not a premium hand, but it has good potential in multi-way pots. It can make straights and flushes.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is early position post-flop. However, I get to act last preflop since everyone has called.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 203 chips (101.5 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n4. **Pot size**: The pot is currently 6 chips (2 from me as BB, 2 from Seat 4's call, 1 from SB, and 1 from Seat 5's additional call to match the BB).\n\n5. **Current situation**: Both Seat 4 and Seat 5 have just called the big blind. This suggests they don't have very strong hands (no raises), but they want to see a flop. The pot is multi-way (3 players including me).\n\n6. **Action needed**: I can check (since there's nothing to call) or raise. The minimum raise is to 4 chips total.\n\nLet me think about whether I should check or raise:\n- **Checking**: Allows me to see a free flop with a speculative hand. This is generally good with suited connectors in multi-way pots.\n- **Raising**: Could narrow the field and potentially take down the pot preflop, but I risk building a big pot with a marginal hand out of position.\n\nWith suited connectors like 8d Td, especially in a multi-way pot, I generally want to see a cheap flop. Checking seems like the standard play here. I get to see the flop for free (well, I've already invested my BB) and can evaluate from there.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here since this is a straightforward preflop decision with a speculative hand, and I don't have specific reads on these opponents yet.\n\nLet me make the decision:",

Board shows 3 spades but both opponents have shown weakness by checking. MiniMax-M2 appears passive based on history. A pot-sized bet applies pressure and builds pot for when I hit.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My cards: 8d Td (8-10 of diamonds)\n- Board: 6s 4c Ks 7s\n- Position: BB\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- It's checked to me on the turn\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have an open-ended straight draw: 5-6-7-8-9 (need a 9 to complete)\n- I have a flush draw: two diamonds in hand, three spades on board (so no flush draw)\n- Wait, let me recalculate: Board is 6s 4c Ks 7s - that's 3 spades, 1 club, 1 heart. I have 8d Td (two diamonds). So I have NO flush draw.\n- I have a straight draw: 5-6-7-8-9 (need a 9)\n\nSo I have an open-ended straight draw with 8 outs (four 9s and four 5s).\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 6 chips\n- I can check for free\n- If I bet, I need to consider if I'll get called\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history from the search:\n- Hand 4: Called preflop with 8d Kc, checked down to showdown\n- Hand 7: Checked then bet 2 on turn, opponent folded\n- Hand 9: Called preflop, checked to river, then bet 2 on river\n- Hand 10: Folded preflop\n- Hand 13: Folded preflop\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems to be a relatively passive player who calls preflop sometimes but doesn't get too aggressive. They do make small bets on later streets.\n\n**Position and stack sizes:**\n- I have 203 chips (healthy stack)\n- MiniMax-M2 has 205 chips\n- GPT-OSS-120B has 222 chips\n\n**Decision:**\nI have an open-ended straight draw. I have two options:\n1. Check and see the river for free\n2. Bet to try to win the pot now or build a pot if I hit\n\nGiven that:\n- Both opponents have checked to me\n- I have a decent draw (8 outs \u2248 17% chance to hit on river)\n- The board has 3 spades, which could scare some hands\n- MiniMax-M2 seems passive and might fold to a bet\n- I don't have a made hand yet\n\nI think betting is a good semi-bluff here. A small bet could:\n- Take down the pot immediately\n- Build the pot for when I hit my straight\n- Charge opponents if they're on a flush draw\n\nA bet of 4-6 chips seems appropriate (2/3 to pot size).\n\nLet me check what happened earlier in this hand:\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 called, GPT-OSS-120B called, I checked\n- Flop: Everyone checked (6s 4c Ks)\n- Turn: GPT-OSS-120B checked to me\n\nThe flop was checked around, suggesting nobody hit the K or has a strong hand. The turn brings the 7s, adding a third spade. This could complete a flush for someone, but it's more likely it didn't help anyone.\n\nGiven the passive action, I think a bet here is good. I'll make it 5 chips (a little less than pot size).\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The board has 3 spades. Someone could have:\n- A spade (any spade gives them a flush)\n- A made hand like Kx\n- A straight draw like me\n\nBut the fact that everyone checked the flop and turn suggests weakness. However, with 3 spades out there, someone with any spade might call.\n\nGiven I only have a straight draw and no flush draw, and the board is getting scary, maybe checking is better to see the river for free.\n\nBut a semi-bluff is still good. I have 8 clean outs to the nuts (straight). If someone has a flush draw, they might fold to a bet. If they have a made hand like a pair of Kings, they might call but I still have equity.\n\nI'll go with a small bet of 4 chips as a semi-bluff.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 9h 9d - Pocket nines. This is a strong starting hand, especially in a tournament with 104 BB stacks.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB, which is out of position postflop. This is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6. This is a 3x raise from the BTN/CO position (seat 5 in a 5-player game).\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n   - Very tight preflop: folded in hands 1-9, then started playing more\n   - In hand 10: called preflop, then raised on flop (showing aggression postflop)\n   - In hand 11: raised preflop to 6, then re-raised to 34 (showing very strong hand)\n   - Hands 12-13: folded preflop\n   - Hand 14: called 1, then checked flop and turn, folded to turn bet\n\n   This opponent appears to be relatively tight but capable of making big raises with strong hands. The raise to 6 could be a standard opening, but based on their tight nature, it's likely a strong hand.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 5 to win 9 (SB + BB + raise). That's 5/14 = 35.7% equity needed.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 104 BB, which is a healthy stack. I don't need to take unnecessary risks, but pocket nines are strong enough to play.\n\n7. **Decision factors**:\n   - Pocket nines are strong but vulnerable to overcards\n   - I'm out of position, which makes it harder to realize equity\n   - Opponent appears tight and likely has a strong range\n   - The raise size is standard (3x), not overly large\n   - I have good stack depth to set mine (trying to hit a set)\n\nWith pocket nines, I have a few options:\n- Fold: Too tight, especially with this hand strength and stack depth\n- Call: Reasonable for set mining, but out of position makes it tough\n- Raise: Could 3-bet to take control or get value from weaker hands\n\nGiven that I'm out of position and facing a tight opponent, I think folding is too weak, and calling is reasonable. However, with pocket nines and a tight opponent, a 3-bet could be good to either take the pot preflop or define the opponent's hand strength.\n\nLet me consider a 3-bet sizing. Minimum raise is to 10, which would be a small 3-bet. A more standard 3-bet would be 3x their raise (to 18) or about 15-20 chips.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the opponent's pattern:\n- They raised to 6 in hand 11, then 4-bet to 34 (very large)\n- They seem to play strong hands aggressively\n- They're tight overall\n\nGiven this, if I 3-bet, they might only continue with very strong hands (QQ+, AK), which would put my 99 in bad shape. If they call, I'm out of position with a hand that often flops an overcard.\n\nThe safer play is to call and set mine. I have good implied odds with 104 BB stack vs their 108 BB stack. If I hit a set, I can win a big pot. If I don't hit, I can easily fold to aggression.\n\nI think calling is the best play here. It's conservative but appropriate given my position and opponent's tight nature.",

The board has an Ace which is concerning, as many hands that would raise preflop could contain an Ace.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB position, which is good post-flop position.\n\n3. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B raised preflop to 6 chips (3x BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They fold a lot preflop (many folds)\n   - They've raised preflop a few times (hands 11, 14)\n   - In hand 10, they called preflop and then raised on the flop\n   - In hand 11, they raised preflop and then raised again (re-raise)\n   - In hand 14, they called preflop and then checked the flop and turn before folding\n\n   This suggests they can be aggressive but also give up when they miss.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 14 chips and it's checked to me. I can check for free and see the turn.\n\n5. **Board texture**: The board is rainbow (6s Ac 3h - spades, clubs, hearts) with no flush draw. There are some straight possibilities (4-5, 5-7, 7-8) but not many. The Ace is the main concern.\n\n6. **My stack**: I have 203 chips, which is a healthy stack.\n\n**Decision analysis**:\n- I have a medium pocket pair that could be ahead if my opponent doesn't have an Ace\n- The board is relatively dry with no flush draws\n- My opponent raised preflop, which often indicates strength, but could be a wide range\n- I can check for free and see what happens on the turn\n- If I bet, I might fold out worse hands and only get called by better hands (any Ace)\n- Checking allows me to control the pot size and potentially get to showdown cheaply\n\nGiven that I have position and can check for free, I should check here. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands (any Ace). Checking allows me to see the turn card for free and reassess.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The user is playing poker and has provided the current state of Hand #15. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: BB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: 9h 9d (pocket nines)\n- Stack: 203 chips (101.5 BB)\n- Board: 6s Ac 3h Th (Turn)\n- Pot: 14 chips\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 with 216 chips\n\n**Action History:**\n- Preflop: Seat 5 raised to 6, I called 5 (from BB)\n- Flop: I checked, Seat 5 checked\n- Turn: Action is on me\n\n**Current Decision:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n- Minimum raise to: 4\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have pocket 9s\n- Board: 6s Ac 3h Th\n- This is a relatively dry board with one overcard (Ace)\n- I have an overpair to the board (9s vs 6,3,T)\n- However, the Ace is scary as opponent could have Ax\n- No flush draws possible (no 3 of same suit)\n- Straight draws: 45, 57, 89, JQ possible but not very likely\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recalled actions, GPT-OSS-120B has been:\n- Very tight preflop: folded 9 out of 11 preflop opportunities before this hand\n- When they entered hand #10: called preflop, then raised on flop\n- Hand #11: raised preflop to 6, then re-raised to 34 (big aggression)\n- Hand #14: called preflop, checked flop and turn, then folded\n\nThis suggests they're TAG (tight-aggressive). They fold most hands, but when they play, they can be aggressive. The check on flop after raising preflop suggests:\n1. They have a strong hand but are trapping (less likely)\n2. They have a marginal hand that missed the flop (more likely)\n3. They have AK/AQ that missed and are giving up\n\n**Position & Stack:**\n- I'm out of position (BB vs their late position)\n- Both stacks are deep (~100+ BB)\n- Pot is small (14 chips)\n\n**Decision Options:**\n1. **Check**: Show weakness, let them bet if they have something, control pot size\n2. **Bet**: Protect hand, get value from worse hands, charge draws\n3. **Fold**: Too weak with overpair\n\n**Key Considerations:**\n- The Ace on board is concerning - they could have AK, AQ, AJ\n- But they checked flop, which weakens their range\n- My hand is vulnerable to overcards\n- I need to protect my hand and get value from worse pairs (77, 88, TT, JJ might call)\n- Checking could induce bluffs but also gives free cards\n\n**Recommended Action:**\nI should make a value bet here. The opponent checked the flop which suggests they don't have a strong Ace. My pocket 9s are likely ahead of their range. A bet will:\n1. Protect against overcards on river\n2. Get value from worse hands\n3. Charge any draws (though few exist)\n4. Define their hand strength\n\nGiven pot is 14, a bet of 8-12 chips seems appropriate. Minimum raise is 4 (which would be a bet of 4), but that's too small. I should bet around 2/3 pot, so about 9-10 chips.\n\nLet me check what the minimum raise to 4 means - this would be a total bet of 4 chips, which is too small. I need to bet more.\n\nI'll bet 10 chips (which is raise_to 10).",

Stack size: I have a healthy stack of 108.5 BB. I shouldn't risk chips with such a weak hand.\n\n4. Pot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win 3 chips, which is 1.5:1 pot odds.

One of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n**Position:** I'm in the BB (Big Blind), so I'm out of position post-flop.\n\n**Stack:** 215 chips (107.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Current Action:** MiniMax-M2 called from middle position (seat 4), and everyone else folded. It's back to me in the BB.\n\n**Pot:** 5 chips (2 from SB, 2 from BB, 1 from MiniMax-M2's call)\n\n**Amount to call:** 0 (I already posted the BB, and MiniMax-M2 just called the BB)\n\n**Legal actions:** fold, check, raise\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- Mostly folds (hands 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18)\n- One preflop call in hand 14, then check-folded on the turn\n- This suggests MiniMax-M2 is relatively tight and only calls with decent hands\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 8-3 offsuit is extremely weak. Should almost never be played, especially out of position.\n2. **Pot odds:** I can check and see a free flop since I already have 2 chips invested and MiniMax-M2 just called.\n3. **Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 appears to be a tight player who mostly folds preflop. When they do call, they likely have a decent hand.\n4. **Position:** I'll be out of position post-flop, which makes playing a weak hand even more difficult.\n5. **Tournament considerations:** While I have a healthy stack, there's no need to risk chips with such a weak hand. The only argument for checking is that it's free, but even then, I'm likely to be dominated post-flop.\n\n**Decision:** With 8-3 offsuit against a tight opponent who called from middle position, I should fold. Even though checking is free, playing this hand out of position is -EV long term. The risk of getting into trouble post-flop with a weak hand isn't worth the potential reward of winning a small pot.\n\n\nI'm folding this trash hand. 8-3 offsuit is unplayable, especially against a tight opponent who likely has a decent range. No point in seeing a free flop with such a weak hand when I'll be out of position and vulnerable post-flop.",

They call preflop with some hands but then check flops frequently. When they do bet, it's usually small bets (2 chips).\n\n**Position and pot odds:**\n- I'm out of position (acting first)\n- Pot is 5 chips (2 from BB, 2 from MiniMax's call, 1 from SB)\n- It costs me 0 to check\n- I could bet, but with my weak hand, that's not advisable\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 215 chips (107.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- No need to get involved with marginal hands\n- Better spots will come\n\n**Decision: Check**\n\nI have absolutely nothing with 8-3 offsuit on this board. The only reason to bet would be as a bluff, but:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. My opponent called preflop, so they likely have something\n3. MiniMax-M2 plays passively and will likely just fold if they miss or call if they hit\n4. There's no need to risk chips with this weak hand\n\nThe best play is to check and see if we can get a free card to hit an 8 or 3, but realistically, I'm planning to fold to any reasonable bet on the turn unless I improve significantly.",

I have:\n- No pair\n- No straight draw (backdoor only)\n- No flush draw (backdoor only)\n- 8 high\n\nThe only way I win is if opponent is bluffing AND gives up later, or if I hit runner-runner perfect cards.\n\nGiven that I have a very weak hand with no real draws, and I'm out of position, I should fold. The small bet size suggests opponent might be weak, but I can't rely on that with 8-high. I should preserve my chips and wait for a better spot.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold with a trash hand against any opponent action.\n\nDecision: Fold",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 6c 5s - This is a weak offsuit connector. Low suited connectors can have some playability in certain situations, but offsuit they're very weak.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions since I'll be out of position postflop.\n\n3. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 4. I need to call 3 chips to see the flop.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 214 chips (107 BB)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B: 209 chips\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data:\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively tight, folding preflop in 4 of the last 6 hands\n   - When they do raise (Hand 15), they bet 6 preflop, then checked flop and folded to a turn bet\n   - They seem to give up easily postflop\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 3 to win 7, so 3:7 or about 30% equity needed.\n\n7. **Hand equity**: 6-5 offsuit has about 35-40% equity against a random hand, but against a tight raiser's range, it's probably more like 25-30%. \n\n8. **Implied odds**: With my stack depth (107 BB), I have good implied odds if I hit a strong hand. However, being out of position makes it harder to realize those implied odds.\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots, especially out of position with weak hands.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. While I have deep stacks and good implied odds potential, I'm out of position with a very weak hand against a tight opponent. The times I hit the flop, I'll often be dominated or have weak draws. The position disadvantage makes it hard to realize my equity and implied odds.\n\nI should save my chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand:** Qc Ks - This is KQo, a strong offsuit hand but from UTG position. This is typically a marginal hand in early position.\n\n**Position:** UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table. I have 8 players left to act behind me.\n\n**Stack:** 220 chips (55 BB) - This is a healthy stack, not too short but also not deep stacked.\n\n**Opponents:** Looking at the recall data, I can see some patterns:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Seen folding a lot preflop, but also called and bet on flop in hand 20\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Playing quite tight, folding frequently preflop\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Mixed play, folding often but also calling and betting small amounts\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has made some raises and folds\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 55 BB, I should be playing a solid TAG (tight-aggressive) strategy. From UTG, I should be very selective with my hands.\n\n**Hand strength analysis:** KQo is a decent hand, but it's dominated by many hands that might call or raise from later positions (AA, KK, QQ, AK, AQ). From UTG, standard play is to fold KQo because:\n1. Too many players left to act\n2. Likely to be dominated if we get action\n3. Difficult to play post-flop out of position\n\nThe pot is only 6 chips, so there's no pressure to defend.\n\n**Standard ranges:** From UTG with 55 BB, typical opening range is something like: 77+, AJ+, KQs, AQo+. Some players even tighter. KQo is right on the borderline but generally considered a fold from UTG in full ring.\n\n**Conclusion:** I should fold KQo from UTG. While it's a decent hand, the positional disadvantage and risk of being dominated make this a clear fold in a tournament setting where preserving chips is important. I can wait for better spots in better position.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: SB (Seat 1) - small blind\n- Hand: Kc 2c (King of clubs, 2 of clubs)\n- Stack: 220 chips (55 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 18 chips (2 from SB + 4 from BB + 12 from raise)\n- Amount to call: 10 (the raise is 12, I've already posted 2)\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise to 20+\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nK2s (suited) is a very marginal hand. It's a \"trouble hand\" because:\n- Dominated by any other king (KX where X > 2)\n- Weak kicker\n- Only suited connector potential is very limited (need both a 3 and an ace for a straight)\n- Flush potential is there but low\n\n**Position:** \nI'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions. I'll be out of position post-flop.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent history:\n- Very tight player (folded preflop in hands 13, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24)\n- When they do raise (hands 15, 20), they often fold on later streets\n- They seem to be playing a tight-aggressive style but giving up easily\n\nTheir raise to 12 (3x BB) from CO position suggests they have a real hand, not just a steal attempt. Given their tight nature, this is likely a strong range (pairs, broadway cards, strong aces, etc.).\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- To call: 10 chips to win 18 chips = 1.8:1 or ~35.7% equity needed\n- K2s typically has around 30-35% equity against a standard raising range\n- The pot odds are marginal at best\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (55 BB)\n- This is not a spot to risk chips with a marginal hand\n- Better to preserve my stack for better opportunities\n\n**Conclusion:**\nEven though the opponent appears tight and might be raising light, K2s is just too weak to defend from the SB. The hand is dominated too often, I'll be out of position, and the pot odds don't justify the call. This is a clear fold.\n\n**Decision:** Fold",

The only time they didn't fold preflop was in hand 19 where they called 2 (likely a limp or small raise). This suggests they're raising with a strong range.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win a pot of 14 (SB 2 + BB 4 + MiniMax-M2 8). That's 14:8 or 1.75:1, which means I need ~36% equity to call profitably.\n\n**Hand equity**: K3o against a tight raising range (likely something like 77+, AJ+, KQ) has terrible equity - probably around 25-30% at best.\n\n**Position advantage**: Even on the button, this hand is very difficult to play postflop. If I hit a K, I'm often dominated by better kickers. If I hit a 3, it's rarely good.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 55 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nGiven:\n1. Very weak hand (K3o)\n2. Facing a raise from a tight player\n3. Bad pot odds for this hand\n4.

          "reasoning_content": "  The user is asking me to make a decision in a poker hand, but I tried to use a tool which isn't the right format. I need to respond with a JSON object containing my action decision.\n\nLet me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Position: CO (Seat 1) - Good position, 2 seats from the button\n- Cards: Jc As (AJ suited clubs) - Strong hand\n- Stack: 220 chips (55 BB) - Healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 18 chips\n- Action: Seat 5 raised to 12 (3x BB)\n- To call: 12 chips\n- Can raise to minimum 20 (which would be a min-raise)\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nAJ suited is a strong hand, especially in position. In CO, this is definitely a playable hand. I need to consider:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: AJ suited is in the top 10-12% of hands. Strong enough to play, especially in position.\n2. **Position**: CO is good position - I'll act after the raiser on all streets.\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 5 raised from early position (relative to blinds). This suggests strength.\n4. **Stack depth**: At 55 BB, I have room to play post-flop.\n5. **Pot odds**: Calling 12 to win 18 = 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed. AJ suited has good equity against most ranges.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight for AJ suited in CO\n- **Call**: Reasonable, see a flop in position\n- **Raise**: Could 3-bet to apply pressure\n\nGiven AJ suited's strength and my position, I think a 3-bet is appropriate. This can:\n- Get value from worse hands\n- Fold out some better hands (like KQ, QJ)\n- Take control of the hand\n- Potentially win preflop\n\nStandard 3-bet size would be 3-4x the original raise. The raise was 12, so 3x would be 36, 4x would be 48.\n\nLet me make a standard 3-bet to 36 chips (3x the original raise).",

This player is clearly playing very tight.\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**: Also very tight - folded 8 out of 10 times preflop, with one raise and one flop bet. Very conservative player.\n\n**Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)**: Moderately tight - folded 7 out of 10 times, but did call once and raise once. They posted the small blind this hand.\n\n**Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)**: Moderately aggressive - folded 6 out of 10 times, but has raised twice (including to 12 chips) and made a call. They posted the big blind this hand.\n\nNow analyzing my situation:\n- **Hand**: 9d 8c (suited connector, off-suit)\n- **Position**: UTG (worst position)\n- **Stack**: 262 chips (65.5 BB)\n- **Blinds**: 2/4\n- **To call**: 4 chips\n\nWith 9-8 offsuit from UTG position, this is a marginal hand at best. I need to consider:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 9-8 offsuit is a weak hand from early position. It has some straight potential but no suit connectivity. It's easily dominated by higher cards.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be acting first on every street with 4 players left to act behind me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: The players behind me are relatively tight (especially seats 2 and 3), but seat 5 has shown aggression. However, given the tight nature of most players, if I limp in, I might face raises.\n\n4. **Stack size**: With 65.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack and tight opponents, I should be selective. 9-8 offsuit from UTG is not a profitable hand to play, especially when I could face a raise from the aggressive player in seat 5.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: 4 chips to call into a 6 chip pot = 2:3 odds or 40% equity needed. Even against random hands, 9-8 offsuit doesn't have this equity, especially out of position.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold. This is a clear fold from UTG with a marginal hand like 9-8 offsuit. The position disadvantage, combined with the hand's weakness and the potential for facing aggression from behind, makes this an easy fold. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

The only player left to act is GPT-OSS-120B who has called from the cutoff position.\n\nLet me analyze what I know about GPT-OSS-120B:\n- They just called 4 chips (2 BB) from the cutoff\n- Looking at their recent history, they've been fairly active:\n  - Hand 25: Raised to 12 (3 BB)\n  - Hand 27: Raised to 12, then called a raise to 24, but folded on the flop\n  - Hand 28: Checked from BB, then folded on flop\n  - Hand 29: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 24: Folded preflop\n\nSo they seem to be playing a somewhat loose/aggressive style with selective aggression. Their call from the cutoff suggests they have a decent but not premium hand.\n\nPosition: I'm in the SB, which is the worst position post-flop. I'll be acting first on every street.\n\nStack: I have 256 chips (64 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips to win a pot of 10 chips (5:1 odds). While the pot odds are decent, my hand is extremely weak and I'll be out of position.\n\nConclusion: With 2-9 offsuit from the SB against a caller who has position on me, this is a clear fold. Even though it's only 2 chips to call (0.5 BB), playing this hand out of position with such a weak holding will cost me more chips post-flop than I'll win. The implied odds are terrible with this hand.\n\nI should fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - Best position\n- Cards: 3d 9c - Very weak hand, unsuited, not connected, low cards\n- Stack: 256 chips (64 BB) - Healthy stack\n- Pot: 6 chips (2 from SB, 4 from BB)\n- To call: 4 chips\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 in SB): Very tight, has folded preflop 6 times in a row, only saw one hand (Hand 30) where they checked through to showdown with 9h Jc on a Ks 2s 8s 6s 8c board. Seems very passive and tight.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB): Also very tight, has folded 8 out of last 10 hands preflop, only raised once (Hand 23) with a 12 chip raise. No showdown data.\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 3d 9c is trash. It's in the bottom 20% of starting hands. No suitedness, no connectivity, low card values.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is great, but with this hand it's not enough to justify playing.\n\n3. **Opponents**: Both opponents are playing very tight. The SB has folded 6 times in a row preflop. The BB has folded 8 out of 10 times. This suggests I might have some fold equity if I raise.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 to win 6, which is 1.5:1. This is not relevant since my hand is so weak.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 64 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take risks with garbage hands. Even though I have position and the blinds seem tight, 3-9 offsuit is just too weak to play.\n\n6. **Stealing opportunity**: Since both opponents are tight, I could consider a steal raise. However, with 3-9 offsuit, if I get called I'm in terrible shape post-flop. The risk/reward isn't worth it.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold. This hand is simply too weak to play even with good position against tight opponents. I should wait for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My Hand:** 3s 3h (pocket 3s) - a low pocket pair\n**Position:** UTG (Under the Gun) - worst position, acting first\n**Stack:** 256 chips (64 BB) - healthy stack\n**Blinds:** 2/4\n**Pot:** 6 chips\n**To call:** 4 chips\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Pocket 3s are a small pocket pair. In early position, this is a very marginal hand. We're looking to hit a set (3 on the flop) which happens about 12% of the time.\n\n2. **Position:** UTG is the worst position. If I call or raise, I have to act first on every street with a weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** From the recall data, I can see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 raised from seat 4 in hand 29 to 8 chips (2x BB)\n   - Kimi-K2 raised from seat 2 in hand 31 to 12 chips (3x BB)\n   - Generally tight play with many folds\n\n4. **Tournament considerations:** With 64 BB, I have a healthy stack. Pocket pairs can be good for set-mining, but from UTG position, it's risky.\n\n5. **Set mining:** The rule of thumb is you need about 15:1 implied odds to set mine profitably. Here, I'm risking 4 chips to potentially win a much larger pot, but from UTG position, it's hard to realize that value.\n\n6. **Raise sizing:** If I were to raise, I'd need to raise to at least 8 chips (min), but likely 12-16 to make it meaningful. This commits too many chips with a weak hand.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. Pocket 3s from UTG is a clear fold. The position disadvantage combined with the low pair makes this an easy fold. I don't want to invest chips with such a marginal hand when I'll be out of position throughout the hand.",

This is a marginal hand but playable in position, especially against a single opponent who just limped from the SB.\n\n**Position:** I have position (on the button) which is a huge advantage.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nLooking at their recent actions:\n- They fold a LOT preflop (hands 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 29, 31, 32)\n- When they do enter pots, they sometimes limp/call (hand 30) or raise (hands 25, 27)\n- In hand 27 they raised to 12, then called a 3-bet to 24, then checked and folded on flop\n- In hand 30 they called 4, then checked down all streets\n\nThis suggests they're playing tight but not ultra-tight. They limp with some hands and raise with others. When they face aggression, they sometimes fold.\n\n**My Options:**\n1. **Check** - See a free flop with my marginal hand\n2. **Raise** - Try to take it down preflop or play a bigger pot in position\n\nGiven I have position and a hand that can flop well (suited connector - wait, it's offsuit, but still connected), checking is reasonable. However, raising could be good because:\n- I'm in position\n- Opponent limped which often indicates weakness\n- I can represent a strong hand\n- If they call, I have position and can control the pot\n\n\n- A standard raise of 3x-4x the big blind (12-16 chips) would be appropriate here\n\nI'll go with a 12-chip raise, which is a standard 3x the big blind. This sizing puts pressure on my opponent while keeping the pot manageable if they decide to call. The raise represents strength and takes advantage of my position, giving me control over the hand's progression.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** Qs Th (Queen of spades, Ten of hearts)\n**Position:** SB (Small Blind)\n**Stack:** 256 chips (64 BB)\n**Board:** 5c 9c 6d\n**Pot:** 12 chips\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Preflop: I called 2 chips (half of SB), BB checked, and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called 4\n- It's checked to me on the flop\n- I can check or raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have Qs Th on a 5c 9c 6d board\n- This is a very dry, rainbow flop with no flush draw\n- I have no pair, no straight draw (need 7-8 for straight, or J-K for straight with my Q-T)\n- I have two overcards (Q and T)\n- Essentially, I have 6 outs (3 Queens + 3 Tens) = ~24% equity on the turn\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nGPT-OSS-120B has been playing relatively tight/passive:\n- Mostly folding preflop (folded in hands 29, 31, 32)\n- When they call preflop, they tend to check down (hand 30: called preflop, then check/check/check on flop/turn/river)\n- They folded on flop in hand 28\n- They called 2 in hand 34 then folded\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is likely to have a marginal hand when they just call preflop. They could have:\n- Small pocket pairs (22-88)\n- Some suited connectors\n- Maybe some broadway cards\n- Ace-high hands\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm out of position (SB) which is a disadvantage\n- I have a healthy stack of 64 BB\n- The pot is small (12 chips)\n\n**Decision:**\nI have two overcards on a dry board. Given that:\n1. The board is very dry (no draws)\n2. I have 6 outs (~24% chance to hit on turn)\n\n\n3. I'm out of position\n4. Opponent seems passive and likely to have missed this board\n5. I can represent a strong hand with a small bet\n\nA strategic probe bet could be effective. I'll make a small 8-chip bet (2/3 pot) to test opponent's strength. This sizing puts pressure on marginal hands while risking minimal chips. If they call or raise, I'm likely behind and can easily fold. The bet serves multiple purposes: gathering information, potentially taking down the pot immediately, and setting up future street decisions.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm in SB with Qs Th\n- Stack: 248 chips (62 BB)\n- Board: 5c 9c 6d Kd\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- Facing a bet of 12 from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)\n\n**My hand:** I have Qs Th. On this board, I have:\n- No pair (Q high)\n- No flush draw (only one spade)\n- No straight draw (I need a J for a straight, but that would be Q-J-T-9-8, which isn't possible with the board cards)\n- Basically just Q high\n\n**Board texture:** 5c 9c 6d Kd\n- Two clubs, so flush draw possible\n- King on the turn - this is a scary card for many hands\n- Pretty coordinated board with potential straight draws (7-8 would make a straight)\n\n**Action history:**\n- Preflop: I called from SB, BB checked, Seat 5 called\n- Flop (5c 9c 6d): I bet 8, both opponents called\n- Turn (Kd): I checked, BB checked, Seat 5 bet 12\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively passive:\n- Folds frequently preflop\n- When they do see flops, they often check/fold\n- In hand 30, they called preflop, then checked all streets\n- They seem to be a relatively tight/passive player\n\nThe turn bet of 12 into a 48 pot is a 1/4 pot bet. This could be:\n- A value bet with a King\n- A semi-bluff with a club flush draw\n- A pure bluff\n- A weak pair trying to protect\n\n**My situation:**\n- I have absolutely nothing but Q high\n- The King is a terrible card for me - it hits many hands that would call preflop (Kx hands)\n- I c-bet the flop and got two callers, which suggests some strength\n- The turn check from me and BB, followed by a bet from Seat 5, suggests they have something\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 12 to win 60 (48+12), which is 20% equity needed. Even if my opponent is bluffing sometimes, I don't think I have enough equity with Q high.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 62 BB, which is a healthy stack.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: Ts Qh - Queen-Ten offsuit. This is a decent but not premium hand. It has good playability but can be dominated.\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - This is excellent position, the best at the table.\n\n**Stack**: 248 chips (62 BB) - Healthy stack size.\n\n**Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 12 chips (3x BB). I need to call 12.\n\nLet me analyze the opponent's tendencies based on the data I just retrieved:\n\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's 20 most recent actions:\n- They raise to 12 chips frequently (hands 25, 27)\n- They sometimes call preflop (hands 27, 30, 35)\n- They fold a lot when faced with pressure (hand 26 preflop, 27 postflop, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34)\n- They seem to play somewhat passively postflop (checking often in hands 27, 28, 30)\n- They do occasionally bet postflop (hand 35 turn)\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is playing fairly straightforward and possibly a bit tight/passive. They make standard raises but often give up when facing resistance.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 12 to win 18 (4 from blinds + 12 from raise + 2 from SB). That's 12/30 = 40% of the pot, which means I need ~30% equity to call (since there's still money behind).\n\n**Hand equity**: QTo on the button vs a standard opening range (say 15-20% of hands) has roughly 45-50% equity. So from a pure equity standpoint, this is a clear call.\n\n**Position advantage**: Being on the button means I'll act last on all postflop streets, which is a huge advantage with a speculative hand like QTo.\n\n**Stack considerations**: I'm not committed yet. Calling 12 from 248 leaves me with 236 chips. \n\nLet me consider my options:\n\n1. **Fold**: Too tight. I have a playable hand in great position with good pot odds.\n\n2. **Call**: Standard play. I have position, decent hand, good pot odds, and my opponent seems straightforward. I can see a flop and evaluate.\n\n3. **Raise**: Could be considered as a squeeze/re-steal. However, given the opponent's tendency to fold to pressure, a raise might get them to fold hands we're ahead of, and we'd risk 20+ chips. Also, we don't have great information about how they respond to 3-bets.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have position\n- I have a playable hand with good equity\n- Pot odds are good\n- Opponent seems straightforward and may fold to pressure postflop\n- My hand plays well postflop in position\n\nI think calling is the best option. Raising is too aggressive with QTo, and folding is too tight. I want to see a flop in position and outplay my opponent postflop.\n\nLet me make the call.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been quite passive, folding frequently preflop and checking/calling when involved. In hand 30, they showed down 9h Jc, indicating they might play some speculative hands. In hand 35, they called on the flop then folded on the turn after checking.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I have Qh Ts on a board of 4d 2d 4h Kd\n- Pot is 80 chips\n- I have 216 chips (54 BB)\n- Board shows a possible flush draw (3 diamonds), and I have the Ts (not a diamond)\n- I have top pair with Q on a K-high board - I'm losing to any K\n- Opponent checked to me\n\nLet me analyze this:\n1. Hand strength: I have Q-high, which is not great on a K-high board. Any K beats me. The board is paired (4s), so there are possible full houses. The 3 diamonds mean possible flushes.\n2. Position: I'm on the button, which is good\n3. Opponent: Based on the history, Kimi-K2 is passive and folds frequently. They called on the flop after I bet, suggesting they might have something but not strong enough to bet themselves.\n4. Pot odds: The pot is 80, and I can check for free or bet\n5. Tournament: We're still relatively deep at 54 BB\n\nThe opponent called my flop bet of 20 into a pot of 28 (preflop 12+12+4=28), so they called 20 into 48, which is about 42% pot odds. They could have:\n- A flush draw (any diamond)\n- A K with weak kicker\n- A pocket pair\n- A 4 (trip 4s)\n- Straight draw (A3, 35)\n\nNow the Kd came on the turn, which is a scare card. If they had a flush draw, they just hit it. If they had a K, they now have top pair. But they checked to me.\n\nGiven their passive nature and the check on the turn, I should probably check behind. Betting would be a bluff since I have no showdown value against a K or any pair. Checking allows me to see the river for free and hope to improve to a Q that might win if they have nothing.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I have Q-high. That's very weak on this board. The opponent called the flop bet, which could mean:\n1. They have a hand they're continuing with\n2. They have a draw\n3. They're floating with air\n\nGiven that they checked the turn, if I bet now, I might get them to fold some weaker hands. But what am I trying to accomplish? I have no real equity here. I should probably just check and give up unless I improve.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The opponent is passive. They called flop, checked turn. This is a good spot for a continuation bet on the turn (double barrel) because:\n1. The Kd is a scare card that hits many hands they might have called with\n\n\n2. My opponent's passive tendencies create an opportunity\n3. A well-timed bet could exploit their weakness\n\nThe opponent's consistent folding pattern suggests they're likely to retreat from confrontation. By applying pressure, I can potentially force them to abandon marginal hands. However, I must carefully assess the risk-reward ratio of this aggressive move.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Board: 4d 2d 4h Kd 8d (four diamonds on board, including Kd and 8d on river)\n- My hand: Ts Qh (no pair, no flush, just ten-high)\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- I'm on the button\n- Only opponent left: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)\n- Action: Seat 2 checked to me\n\n**Board analysis:**\n- Four diamonds on board: 4d, 2d, Kd, 8d\n- Any opponent with any diamond has a flush\n- The board is paired (4s), but only once\n- I have no showdown value with Ts Qh\n\n**Opponent analysis from memory:**\nLooking at the opponent actions, Seat 2 has been:\n- Folding a lot preflop (many folds)\n- When they do play, they check-call on the flop in hand #35\n- In hand #30, they showed down 9h Jc on a board with 4 spades (Ks 2s 8s 6s 8c) - they called down with just a jack-high\n\nThis suggests Seat 2 is a calling station who will call with weak hands, even on dangerous boards.\n\n**Action in this hand:**\n- Preflop: Called my 12 chip raise\n- Flop (4d 2d 4h): Checked, I bet 20, they called\n- Turn (Kd): Checked to me, I checked\n- River (8d): They checked to me\n\nThe turn check from me was likely weak, and now they checked again. They called the flop bet on a paired board with two diamonds, so they could have:\n- A weak made hand (pair, two pair)\n- A flush draw that just got there\n- A straight draw\n- Air\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check: Showdown with ten-high, which likely loses\n2. Bet as a bluff: Try to get them to fold better hands\n\nGiven that this opponent seems to call with weak hands (like J9 on a 4-flush board in hand #30), bluffing is dangerous. However, the four diamonds on board is very scary. \n\nBut wait - let me reconsider. The opponent called on the flop when there were just two diamonds. They might have had:\n- A weak pair\n- A draw\n- Some random hand\n\nNow with four diamonds, if they don't have a diamond, they likely can't call a bet. But based on their showdown in hand #30, they called with J-high on a 4-flush board. That suggests they're not easily scared.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI have zero showdown value. Betting would be pure bluff. Given the opponent's tendency to call with weak hands (as shown in hand #30), this is not a good bluffing spot. I should check and give up.\n\nThe opponent's check could mean weakness, but it could also mean they have a weak made hand or a flush and are trying to induce a bluff. Given their calling station tendencies, I don't want to bluff.\n\nI'll check and likely lose, but preserve my chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent data for GPT-OSS-120B in seat 5:\n\n1. They showed down Kh5h in hand 30 - so they play some weaker broadway hands\n2. In hand 35 they called preflop, called flop, then bet turn - showing some postflop aggression\n3. In hand 36 they raised preflop to 12, then checked and folded on flop - so their preflop raises don't always connect\n4. Overall they seem moderately aggressive but not overly loose\n\nNow analyzing my situation:\n- Hand: 4d 7s - complete trash, offsuit, gapper, low cards\n- Position: CO - decent position but not great\n- Stack: 216 chips (54 BB) - healthy stack\n- Facing a raise to 12 (3x BB)\n- Pot odds: 18 in pot, need to call 12 = 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed\n\nWith 4-7 offsuit, I have terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a random hand, 4-7o only has about 38% equity, and against a typical raising range it's much worse (likely 20-25%).\n\nThis is a clear fold. I don't need to risk 12 chips with such a weak hand, especially when I have a healthy stack and can wait for better spots. The opponent's raise suggests they have a real hand, and even if they're bluffing sometimes, 4-7o has very little playability postflop.\n\nThe only consideration might be if I wanted to 3-bet bluff, but:\n1. My hand has no blockers\n2. I'm in CO, not the best bluffing position\n3. 4-7o has terrible postflop playability if called\n4. I have a healthy stack and don't need to take high-variance spots\n\nThis is an easy fold.",

Even suited, it's:\n   - Very low card values\n   - Poor straight potential (9-2 gap)\n   - Flush potential is marginal at best\n   - Easily dominated by most hands\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG, which is the worst position. I'll be acting first on every street with many players behind me. This increases risk significantly.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 54 BB, which is a decent stack but not deep enough to play marginal hands from early position. I should be selective.\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should preserve my chips and wait for better spots. 9-2 suited is not worth risking even 4 chips.\n\n5. **Opponent Context**: I don't have specific reads on these opponents, but in general, playing 9-2 from UTG against unknown players is -EV.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. 9-2 suited is in the bottom 10% of starting hands. From UTG, I should be playing premium hands (AA-QQ, AK, maybe AQ, some suited connectors occasionally). 9-2 is far too weak.",

This is a weak hand but it is suited and has some potential.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind). Everyone else has folded except Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) who just called the BB.\n\n3. **Stack**: 212 chips (53 BB) - healthy stack\n\n4. **Action**: The SB folded, and MiniMax-M2 just called from what appears to be the CO position (since Seats 2 and 3 folded before them).\n\n5. **Opponent info**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent history, they've been very tight - folding preflop in hands 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, and 38. In hand 32, they checked down and then made a small bet on the river. This suggests they're a conservative player who only plays strong hands.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I have the option to check and see a free flop. The pot is currently 10 chips (2 from SB + 4 from BB + 4 from caller).\n\n7. **Position post-flop**: I'll be out of position against MiniMax-M2 for the rest of the hand.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have a weak hand (A2 suited) but it has some potential\n- I can see the flop for free (no additional cost)\n- My opponent appears to be very tight, so their calling range is likely strong\n- I'm out of position\n- I have a healthy stack\n\nThe best play is to check and see the flop. Raising would be spewy with A2, especially against a tight opponent who likely has a better Ace or pocket pair. Folding is free but we're getting 0% equity. Checking gives us a chance to hit a flush, straight draw, or pair our Ace with a weak kicker (though that's not ideal).\n\nLet me check.",

On the turn, they're checking, which could mean:\n1. They have a marginal hand and are giving up\n2. They have a strong hand and are trying to trap\n3. They have a draw and want a free card\n\n**Position and Stack:**\n- I'm out of position (BB)\n- I have a healthy stack of 51 BB\n- Pot is 24, which is about 12% of my stack\n\n**Decision:**\nI have a very weak hand (Ace-high). The opponent bet the flop strongly but is now checking the turn. This could be a sign of weakness. However, I have no real hand strength and I'm out of position.\n\nMy options:\n1. Check - see a free river card, keep pot small\n2. Bet - try to take it down now, but risk being called/raised\n\nGiven that:\n- I have minimal equity (just Ace-high)\n- My opponent showed strength on the flop\n- I'm out of position\n- There's no value in betting (only better hands call, worse hands fold)\n- Checking gives me a free chance to improve\n\nI should check.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm in BB (Seat 1) with Ac 2c\n- River board: 9d 5c 6s Qs 3c\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- I have 205 chips (51.2 BB)\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4 with 196 chips\n- Action: It's on me to act, and I can check or raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- My hand: Ace-high with a club flush draw\n- Board: 9d 5c 6s Qs 3c\n- Final board has 3 clubs (5c, Qs is not a club - wait, Qs is spades, so only 2 clubs: 5c and 3c)\n- Let me recount: 9d (diamond), 5c (club), 6s (spade), Qs (spade), 3c (club)\n- So there are exactly 2 clubs on the board: 5c and 3c\n- I have Ac 2c, so I have a flush draw but only 2 clubs on board means I have 4 clubs total (Ac, 2c, 5c, 3c)\n- Wait, that's not right. For a flush I need 5 cards of the same suit. I have Ac and 2c, and the board has 5c and 3c. That's 4 clubs total. I don't have a flush.\n\n**Wait, let me recount the board again:**\n9d 5c 6s Qs 3c\n- 9d = 9 of diamonds\n- 5c = 5 of clubs\n- 6s = 6 of spades\n- Qs = Queen of spades\n- 3c = 3 of clubs\n\nSo there are exactly 2 clubs on the board: 5c and 3c.\nI hold Ac and 2c, so I have 4 clubs total, which is not a flush. I just have Ace-high.\n\n**Opponent behavior (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the recall data, MiniMax-M2 has been:\n- Very tight preflop (lots of folds)\n- When they do play, they've shown aggression (bets and raises)\n- In hand 28: called preflop, then bet 4 on flop\n\n\n- In hand 32: checked flop and turn, bet 4 on river\n- In hand 29: raised preflop to 8\n\nI'm seeing a pattern of cautious play with occasional strategic aggression. Their actions suggest a player who waits for strong hands before committing significant chips. The betting behavior indicates they might be trying to control pot size or protect a marginal hand. With a tight-aggressive profile, they're likely to have a strong range when they do decide to bet or raise.\n\nMy kicker is weak, and the board presents potential straight and flush risks. Checking seems the most prudent move given the opponent's tight-aggressive tendencies and my vulnerable hand strength.",

It's a decent speculative hand that can make strong straights and flushes, but it's not a premium hand.\n\n**Position**: SB (Small Blind) - This is the worst position since I'll act first after the flop.\n\n**Stack**: 215 chips (53.8 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Current action**: \n- Blinds are 2/4\n- Pot is 14 chips (2 + 4 + 8 raise)\n- GPT-OSS-120B raised to 8 (a min-raise from the button)\n- I need to call 6 to see the flop\n- I can also raise to at least 12\n\n**Opponent analysis** (GPT-OSS-120B):\nLooking at their recent actions:\n- They fold frequently preflop (hands 29, 31, 32, 38, 39)\n- They sometimes call (hands 30, 34, 35)\n- They occasionally raise (hands 36, 37)\n- When they do raise preflop, they often continuation bet on the flop but then fold to resistance (hand 36 flop check-fold, hand 37 flop bet-fold)\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is somewhat tight-aggressive but can be pushed off hands postflop.\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: J10s is a decent speculative hand. I have about 53.8 BB stack.\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, which is bad position postflop.\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 6 to win 14, which is 2.33:1 odds. This is decent for a speculative hand.\n4. **Implied odds**: If I hit a strong hand (straight or flush), I could win a big pot.\n5. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B seems capable of folding to pressure.\n\n**Options**:\n- **Fold**: Too tight. I have a decent hand and good odds.\n- **Call**: Reasonable. I can see a flop with a speculative hand. But I'll be out of position.\n- **Raise**: I could make a 3-bet to 12-16 chips. This would give me initiative and potentially take down the pot preflop or on the flop. Given the opponent's tendency to fold to pressure, this could be profitable.\n\nWith a suited connector like J10s, being out of position is problematic. I either want to see a cheap flop or take down the pot preflop. A small 3-bet could accomplish the latter, especially against an opponent who folds to pressure.\n\nGiven that GPT-OSS-120B has shown they can raise with marginal hands and then fold to flop pressure, I think a 3-bet is a good play here. It gives me initiative and I can continuation bet on many flops.\n\nLet me make a raise to 16 (4x their raise). This is a solid 3-bet size that puts pressure on them.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The minimum raise is to 12, which is only 4 more chips for them to call. That's not much pressure. If I raise to 16, that's 8 more for them to call. Given they raised to 8, a raise to 16 seems appropriate - it's a 2x raise of their bet.\n\nBut looking at my stack of 215, raising to 16 is only about 7.4% of my stack, which is reasonable.\n\nLet me go with a raise to 16 to apply pressure and take initiative.",

The pot is 40 chips (16+16+8 from the folds? Let me recalculate: SB 2 + BB 4 + Seat 5 raise 8 + my re-raise to 16 + Seat 2 call 12 = 2+4+8+16+12 = 42... hmm, but it says pot is 40. Let me just trust the pot size given).\n\nI have Jd Th on a flop of Qs 8s 4h.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n- I have an open-ended straight draw (any 9 or K gives me a straight)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (if I hit two more diamonds)\n- I have two overcards (J and T) but the Q is on the board, so only the J is a true overcard\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 40 chips\n- I can check for free, so infinite pot odds to see the turn\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nI queried Seat 2's actions. Let me analyze:\n\n\nSeat 2's playing style reveals a cautious approach. They frequently fold preflop and tend to check rather than bet aggressively. When they do show down, it's typically with strong hands like top pair or better. This suggests they're tight and passive, waiting for premium hands before committing significant chips.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nWith my drawing hand, I have multiple potential outs. The straight draw gives me 8 clean outs, plus potential overcard opportunities. Given the opponent's passive nature, checking seems like the most prudent move to see the turn card without risking additional chips.\n\nThe board texture is moderately wet with a flush draw, but I don't currently have a flush draw. My opponent called a preflop raise, which could mean:\n- A pocket pair\n- A Qx hand\n- A suited connector that hit the flush draw\n- Maybe A8, A4, etc.\n\nGiven that they called my preflop raise from the BB, they could have a decent hand. The fact that they just called (rather than re-raising) suggests they don't have a premium hand like QQ+, but they could have:\n- Qx (QJ, QT, Q9, etc.)\n- 88, 44 (sets)\n- spade draws (AsXs, KsXs, etc.)\n- Straight draws (JT, T9, etc.)\n- Other pairs\n\nSince I have the betting lead and position, I could consider a continuation bet. However, this board likely hits my opponent's calling range. They would call with any Q, any 8, any 4, any spade draw, any straight draw, etc.\n\nMy hand has decent equity with the open-ended straight draw (8 outs = ~16% on the turn, ~32% by the river). Checking is free and I can re-evaluate on the turn.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack of 50 BB. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Decision:**\nI think checking is the best option. I have a drawing hand with good equity, I'm in position, and I can see the turn for free. If I bet, I likely get called by better hands and fold out worse hands. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to realize my equity.\n\nLet me reconsider - maybe a small bet could be good? If I bet small, I might fold out some hands that have equity against me, and I could get value from some worse draws. But generally, with a drawing hand like this, checking is standard.\n\nActually, I have the betting lead from preflop. A continuation bet could be good here. The board is Q-high, which is good for my range as the preflop raiser. I have some equity with my draw. A small c-bet could fold out some hands and build the pot for when I hit.\n\nBut wait -"

Let me just trust the pot size given).\n\nI have Jd Th on a flop of Qs 8s 4h.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n- I have an open-ended straight draw (any 9 or K gives me a straight)\n- I have a backdoor flush draw (if I hit two more diamonds)\n- I have two overcards (J and T) but the Q is on the board, so only the J is a true overcard\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 40 chips\n- I can check for free, so infinite pot odds to see the turn\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nI queried Seat 2's actions. Let me analyze:\n\n\nSeat 2's playing style reveals a cautious approach. They frequently fold preflop and tend to check rather than bet aggressively. When they do show down, it's typically with strong hands like top pair or better. This suggests they're tight and passive, waiting for premium hands before committing significant chips.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\nWith my drawing hand, I have multiple potential outs. The straight draw gives me 8 clean outs, plus potential overcard opportunities. Given the opponent's passive nature, checking seems like the most prudent move to see the turn card without risking additional chips.\n\nThe board texture is moderately wet with a flush draw, but I don't currently have a flush draw. My opponent called a preflop raise, which could mean:\n- A pocket pair\n- A Qx hand\n- A suited connector that hit the flush draw\n- Maybe A8, A4, etc.\n\nGiven that they called my preflop raise from the BB, they could have a decent hand. The fact that they just called (rather than re-raising) suggests they don't have a premium hand like QQ+, but they could have:\n- Qx (QJ, QT, Q9, etc.)\n- 88, 44 (sets)\n- spade draws (AsXs, KsXs, etc.)\n- Straight draws (JT, T9, etc.)\n- Other pairs\n\nSince I have the betting lead and position, I could consider a continuation bet. However, this board likely hits my opponent's calling range. They would call with any Q, any 8, any 4, any spade draw, any straight draw, etc.\n\nMy hand has decent equity with the open-ended straight draw (8 outs = ~16% on the turn, ~32% by the river). Checking is free and I can re-evaluate on the turn.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack of 50 BB. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Decision:**\nI think checking is the best option. I have a drawing hand with good equity, I'm in position, and I can see the turn for free. If I bet, I likely get called by better hands and fold out worse hands. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to realize my equity.\n\nLet me reconsider - maybe a small bet could be good? If I bet small, I might fold out some hands that have equity against me, and I could get value from some worse draws. But generally, with a drawing hand like this, checking is standard.\n\nActually, I have the betting lead from preflop. A continuation bet could be good here. The board is Q-high, which is good for my range as the preflop raiser. I have some equity with my draw. A small c-bet could fold out some hands and build the pot for when I hit.\n\nBut wait -",

My hand is weak - only a gutshot\n2. Pot odds are not sufficient (need 21.4% equity, I have ~16%)\n3. Opponent bet 24 into 64 (37.5% pot) - not huge but meaningful\n4.

However, hitting a 9 might not even give me the best hand (someone could have KJ or JT for a higher straight)\n\n**Recommendation**: FOLD\n\nThe pot odds don't justify the call, and even if I hit my straight, it won't be the nuts. The opponent's bet suggests they have something, and I'm unlikely to win this pot without improving significantly. With my stack size, I should preserve chips for better spots.\n\nLet me double-check my reasoning:\n- 4 outs to the straight (9s)\n- 4 outs \u00d7 2% per out per street \u2248 8% equity by the river (not 16% - I need to recalculate)\n- Actually, with one card to come: 4/47 \u2248 8.5% \n- With two cards to come: ~16%\n\nFor a flop call, I should consider the odds of hitting on the turn specifically since I might not get to see the river for free. So ~8.5% chance to hit on turn.\n\nPot odds require 21.4% equity, I only have ~8.5% on the turn. This is a clear fold.",

Made a big raise on flop in hand 37 (80 chips). Seems capable of playing back.\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB): Very tight! Folded preflop in 6 out of 10 hands shown. Only called once and raised once. This player is clearly tight.\n\nWith T2o on the button facing a tight BB and an active SB, I should fold this hand. Even though I have position, this hand is just too weak to play. I don't want to invest chips with such a poor hand when I have a decent stack.\n\nThe pot odds are poor (1.5:1), and even if I hit a T or 2, I'm unlikely to win a big pot and could easily be dominated. There's no straight or flush potential worth mentioning.\n\nFolding is the clear decision here.",

Ace-King suited is one of the best starting hands in poker.\n\n**Position:** UTG (Under the Gun - first to act) - This is the worst position since I have to act first post-flop.\n\n**Stack:** 201 chips (25.1 BB) - This is a decent stack size, not too short but not deep either.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- **DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB):** Based on recent history, they fold a lot preflop (hands 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 40, 41). They only called once (hand 37) and raised once (hand 38). They seem tight.\n- **MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB):** Also folds a lot preflop (hands 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41). Only called once (hand 39) and showed down As4d. They seem tight as well.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** AKs is a premium hand, only AA and KK are stronger. This is definitely a raising hand.\n2. **Position:** Being UTG is bad, but with such a strong hand, I should raise for value.\n3. **Opponents:** Both opponents seem tight and fold frequently. Raising should often take down the blinds.\n4. **Stack Size:** With 25.1 BB, I can afford a standard raise without committing too much of my stack.\n5. **Tournament Considerations:** I should be accumulating chips with premium hands.\n\n**Standard Play:** With AKs UTG, the standard play is to raise. I should raise to about 2.5-3x the big blind. With blinds at 4/8, a raise to 20-24 chips would be standard. The minimum raise is 16, but that's too small.\n\nLet me make a solid raise to 24 chips (3x BB). This should:\n- Build the pot when I have a premium hand\n- Charge weaker hands to see the flop\n- Possibly take down the blinds immediately against tight opponents\n- Set me up for a continuation bet if I miss the flop\n\nIf I just call, I'd be letting weaker hands see a cheap flop and playing out of position, which is not optimal with AK.\n\n**Decision:** Raise to 24 chips.",

This is a marginal hand, but it's suited and has some potential for a flush or straight.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind), which is good position postflop but I have to act first preflop.\n\n3. **Action**: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has called the 8 chip BB. Everyone else folded. I can check and see a free flop.\n\n4. **Pot**: 20 chips (4 from SB + 8 from my BB + 8 from Seat 4's call)\n\n5. **Stack size**: I have 205 chips (25.6 BB), which is a decent stack in a tournament.\n\n6. **Opponent info**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n   - Very tight preflop: folded 3 out of 4 hands (hands 40, 41, 42)\n   - In hand 43, they called 20 preflop, then called 40 on the flop, then folded on the turn\n   - They showed down with K-8 offsuit in hand 4 and A-4 offsuit in hand 39\n   - They seem to be a somewhat passive player who calls rather than raises\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 25.6 BB, I don't want to get into a big pot with a marginal hand like J5s unless I hit something strong. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n8. **Pot odds**: I can check for free, so there's no immediate cost to see the flop.\n\nGiven that I can see the flop for free, I have a suited hand with some potential, and my opponent seems relatively tight/passive, I should check and see the flop. There's no reason to raise with J5s here - if I raise, I'm likely only getting called by better hands, and I'm out of position. Checking gives me a chance to hit a strong hand or draw cheaply.\n\nThe best play is to check and see the flop.",

Let me analyze their tendencies from the recall:\n\nFrom the opponent actions:\n- Very tight preflop (lots of folds)\n- When they do play, they seem passive postflop (checking, small bets)\n- In hand 43, they called a 40-chip bet on the flop, then folded turn\n- They typically make small bets (4, 7 chips) rather than large ones\n\n**Current situation:**\n- It's checked to me on the flop\n- I have a flush draw (9 outs = ~18% equity per street, ~36% by river)\n- Pot is 20 chips\n- I'm out of position\n\n**Decision:** I should bet here for several reasons:\n1. **Semi-bluff value**: I have good equity with the flush draw\n2. **Protection**: If opponent has a weak hand, I can win the pot now\n3. **Build the pot**: If I hit my flush, I want a bigger pot\n4. **Opponent tendency**: MiniMax-M2 tends to be passive and may fold to aggression\n\nGiven the pot is 20, a bet of around 12-16 chips (60-80% pot) would be appropriate. Let me make a standard 2/3 pot bet which would be about 13-14 chips. Since minimum raise is 8, I can bet more than that.\n\nI have 205 chips, so plenty of room to make a solid bet.",

Now on turn, pot is 48 and I can check or raise.\n\n**Decision:**\n- I have a strong flush draw but it's not the nut flush (Ah would be nuts)\n- The board is relatively dry for made hands - no pairs, no straights yet\n- Opponent called my flop bet which suggests some strength but not necessarily a monster\n- Checking gives me a free card to hit my flush\n- Raising would be semi-bluffing but I'm not sure if that's optimal with just a flush draw\n\nGiven the pot is already 48 chips and I have a decent flush draw, I should check here. I don't want to build a bigger pot with just a draw, and checking allows me to see the river for free and potentially hit my flush. If I miss on river, I can decide based on opponent's action.\n\nLet me check if there's any more information I should consider...",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have Jh 5h with a board of 3h 9d 2h 6d\n   - I have a flush draw (hearts)\n   - I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 4 for a straight)\n   - Currently, I only have Jack high with no pair\n\n2. **Position**: I'm BB (out of position)\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 191 chips (23.9 BB) - decent stack but not huge\n\n4. **Action History**:\n   - Preflop: Seat 4 called 8, I checked\n   - Flop: I bet 14, Seat 4 called\n   - Turn: I checked, Seat 4 bet 14\n\n5. **Pot**: 62 chips, need to call 14\n   - Pot odds: 62:14 or about 4.4:1\n\n6. **Opponent Analysis**:\n   - Looking at Seat 4's history: They've been relatively passive, folding preflop several times, calling rather than raising\n   - In hand 43, they called preflop, checked/called flop, then check-folded on turn\n   - They seem to be a cautious player who bets when they have something\n\n7. **My Draws**:\n   - Flush draw: 9 hearts left (13 total - 4 on board/my hand)\n   - Gutshot: 4 outs (four 4s)\n   - Some outs might overlap (4h gives me both)\n   - Total clean outs: ~12 (9 hearts + 3 non-heart 4s)\n   - Odds of hitting on river: ~25% (12/46)\n\n8. **Pot Odds Calculation**:\n   - 25% chance to hit means I need 3:1 pot odds\n   - Getting 4.4:1, which is good enough for a call\n   - Plus implied odds if I hit\n\n9. **Tournament Consideration**:\n   - I have 23.9 BB, which is decent but not deep\n   - Calling 14 costs me ~1.75 BB\n   - If I hit my draw, I can likely win a decent pot\n   - If I miss, I still have a playable stack\n\nThe opponent's bet sizing is small (14 into 62 pot), which could mean:\n- They're trying to control the pot with a medium strength hand\n- They're betting a draw themselves\n- They have a weak made hand and don't want to face a raise\n\nGiven the pot odds, my draws, and the opponent's passive tendencies, I should call here. I have good equity with the flush draw and gutshot.\n\nHowever, I could also consider raising as a semi-bluff. Looking at the opponent's history, they folded on turn in hand 43 after check-calling flop. They might be capable of folding to pressure.\n\nLet me think about raising:\n- If I raise to 28 (min raise), I'm risking 28 to win 62\n- Need ~31% fold equity to break even\n- Given their passive nature, they might fold marginal hands\n- But if they call, I'm building a bigger pot with a draw\n\nI think calling is the better option because:\n1. I have good pot odds to draw\n2. I keep the pot small in case I'm drawing dead\n3. I maintain my stack size\n4. I can re-evaluate on the river\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The opponent bet 14 after I checked. This is a small bet that could be:\n- A weak made hand trying to get value cheaply\n- A draw\n- Air\n\nGiven my pot odds (4.4:1) and my equity (~25% to hit plus some implied odds), calling is profitable. But I also have fold equity if I raise.\n\nWith a raise to 28:\n- I'm risking 28 to win 76 (current pot + their bet + my raise)\n- They need to fold about 27% of the time for this to be profitable\n- Given their passive nature, they might fold often enough\n\nBut calling is safer and I have direct pot odds to do so. I think I'll call and see the river.",

So I have a straight! 2-3-4-5-6\n- Wait, let me check: 2h, 3h, 4c, 6d - yes, I have 5h, so 2-3-4-5-6 is a straight!\n\nSo I have a straight: 2-3-4-5-6\n\n\nI'm carefully evaluating the potential threats on this board. The flush draw missed, but there are still dangerous possibilities. The opponent's betting pattern suggests they might have a strong hand, potentially a higher straight or even a made flush. With multiple straight combinations possible, including higher straights like 5-6-7-8-9, I need to proceed cautiously. The coordinated nature of the board means I could be vulnerable to stronger hands, despite having a made straight.\n\nI analyze the betting sequence, noting the opponent's aggressive turn action. My current straight looks solid, but the potential for a higher straight or flush draw gives me pause. The pot size of 76 chips and my remaining stack of 177 chips create an interesting strategic decision point. I'll need to carefully weigh the risks of betting versus checking, considering the opponent's potential hand range and the board's dangerous texture.\n\nThe opponent's betting pattern suggests some uncertainty, but their call on the flop and bet on the turn indicate possible strength. With multiple potential draws out there, I'm leaning towards a defensive approach. A check seems prudent to control the pot size and gather more information about my opponent's hand strength.\n\nMy straight is vulnerable, and the board's texture indicates potential danger. The opponent's stack size and previous actions hint at a possible medium-strength hand. Checking allows me to manage risk while keeping the pot manageable.\n\nI'll carefully consider my options: checking provides pot control, while a small value bet might extract some additional chips if my opponent has a weaker hand. The key is balancing potential value against the risk of facing a difficult decision if they raise.\n\nMy opponent's previous betting pattern suggests some aggression, but not overwhelming strength. A modest value bet of around 18-24 chips could be appropriate, targeting weaker made hands or potential bluffs. This sizing allows me to gain information while minimizing potential losses.\n\nThe board texture and my straight's relative vulnerability mean I should be cautious. Checking is the safer play, letting me control the pot and potentially induce a bluff from my opponent. I'll prioritize pot control over thin value extraction.\n\nIf I bet, a small sizing around 20-25 chips seems most prudent, giving me flexibility to respond to a raise while potentially extracting value from marginal hands. The key is maintaining a strategic edge without overcommitting to a potentially dangerous board.\n\nI need to consider my opponent's aggressive tendencies carefully. Their check on the flop followed by a turn bet suggests potential strength, but not necessarily a monster hand. Checking allows me"

The coordinated nature of the board means I could be vulnerable to stronger hands, despite having a made straight.\n\nI analyze the betting sequence, noting the opponent's aggressive turn action. My current straight looks solid, but the potential for a higher straight or flush draw gives me pause. The pot size of 76 chips and my remaining stack of 177 chips create an interesting strategic decision point. I'll need to carefully weigh the risks of betting versus checking, considering the opponent's potential hand range and the board's dangerous texture.\n\nThe opponent's betting pattern suggests some uncertainty, but their call on the flop and bet on the turn indicate possible strength. With multiple potential draws out there, I'm leaning towards a defensive approach. A check seems prudent to control the pot size and gather more information about my opponent's hand strength.\n\nMy straight is vulnerable, and the board's texture indicates potential danger. The opponent's stack size and previous actions hint at a possible medium-strength hand. Checking allows me to manage risk while keeping the pot manageable.\n\nI'll carefully consider my options: checking provides pot control, while a small value bet might extract some additional chips if my opponent has a weaker hand. The key is balancing potential value against the risk of facing a difficult decision if they raise.\n\nMy opponent's previous betting pattern suggests some aggression, but not overwhelming strength. A modest value bet of around 18-24 chips could be appropriate, targeting weaker made hands or potential bluffs. This sizing allows me to gain information while minimizing potential losses.\n\nThe board texture and my straight's relative vulnerability mean I should be cautious. Checking is the safer play, letting me control the pot and potentially induce a bluff from my opponent. I'll prioritize pot control over thin value extraction.\n\nIf I bet, a small sizing around 20-25 chips seems most prudent, giving me flexibility to respond to a raise while potentially extracting value from marginal hands. The key is maintaining a strategic edge without overcommitting to a potentially dangerous board.\n\nI need to consider my opponent's aggressive tendencies carefully. Their check on the flop followed by a turn bet suggests potential strength, but not necessarily a monster hand. Checking allows me",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent MiniMax-M2 has been relatively passive based on the recent hands. Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have Jh5h\n- Board: 3h 9d 2h 6d 4c\n- I have a straight: 2-3-4-5-6\n- Pot: 76 chips\n- My stack: 177 chips\n- Opponent stack: 100 chips\n\n**Key observations:**\n1. I have a straight (2-3-4-5-6)\n2. The board has 2 hearts (3h, 2h) - no made flush possible\n3. Higher straights are possible: 3-4-5-6-7, 4-5-6-7-8, 5-6-7-8-9\n4. Opponent called flop bet and bet turn - they likely have something\n5. Based on opponent history, they're relatively passive/tricky\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 22 BB, which is a decent stack but not deep\n- Opponent has 12.5 BB, shorter stack\n- Pot is already 76 chips, which is significant\n\n**Decision:**\nI have a straight but it's not the nuts. However, given that:\n- The opponent is passive based on history\n- They called flop and bet turn (could have a pair, two pair, or a draw)\n- Checking might induce a bluff from missed draws\n- Value betting could be good but I risk getting raised by better hands\n\nGiven the opponent's passive tendencies and the fact that I don't have the nuts, I think checking for pot control and potentially inducing a bluff is the best play. This is especially good given that the opponent bet the turn and might continue with a bluff on the river.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. I have a straight and the opponent has shown some aggression on the turn. They could have:\n- Two pair (like 9x, 6x, 4x)\n\n\n- A set (unlikely given the board)\n- A missed flush draw\n- A straight draw that missed\n- A lower straight\n\nI'll go with a strategic check. The opponent's passive nature and potential for bluffing make this a smart move. Checking allows me to control the pot size and potentially extract value if they decide to bet. With my decent but not unbeatable straight, this approach minimizes risk while keeping my options open.",

My hand: I have Jack-high. The board shows possible straight draws (3-4-5-6, 2-3-4-5-6, etc.) but I don't have a straight. I missed my flush draw.\n2. The opponent has bet on the turn and river after I showed weakness by checking. This suggests they have something.\n3. Pot odds: I need to call 14 to win 90, so about 15.6% pot odds. I need to be right ~15.6% of the time to break even.\n4. My hand is very weak - just Jack-high. \n5. The opponent's betting pattern: they called my flop bet, then bet turn and river when I checked. This is consistent with:\n   - A made hand (pair, two pair, straight)\n   - A bluff\n   - A missed draw trying to steal\n\nHowever, given that:\n- I have no pair, no draw\n- The opponent has shown aggression on turn and river\n- My hand is very weak\n- The opponent only has 86 chips left and is betting 14 into a 90 pot, which is a significant bet relative to their stack\n\nI should **fold**. I have a very weak hand, and even though the pot odds are decent, I have no showdown value. The opponent's betting pattern suggests they have something, and I can't beat even a small pair or Ace-high.\n\nLet me make sure I'm not missing anything:\n- Could I have the best hand? Unlikely. Jack-high is very weak.\n- Could they be bluffing? Possible, but I have no way to know, and calling with Jack-high is just hoping.\n- Are the pot odds good enough? 15.6% is low, but I likely have less than that chance of winning.\n\nThe fold seems clear here.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: 8h Js - This is a marginal hand, offsuit and disconnected. Not a strong starting hand.\n\n**Position**: SB (Small Blind) - This is a terrible position, I'll be out of position post-flop.\n\n**My stack**: 173 chips (21.6 BB) - This is a decent stack, not desperate yet.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Blinds are 4/8\n- GPT-OSS-120B raised to 24 (3x the big blind)\n- I need to call 20 chips to see the flop\n- Pot is currently 36 chips, would be 56 if I call\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Let me look at what GPT-OSS-120B has been doing. From the data:\n- They've been folding a LOT preflop (hands 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44 all folded)\n- They raised in hand 40 to 8 chips (small raise) but then folded\n- They bet 30 on flop in hand 37 but then folded\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is relatively tight and doesn't play many hands. When they do raise to 24 (3x BB), it's likely a real hand, not a steal attempt. They have a short stack of 91 chips (11.4 BB), so they're in \"push/fold\" territory.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 20 to win 36, which is about 1.8:1. This is not great odds for a marginal hand like J8o.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 21.6 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. J8o from SB against a raise from a tight player is a clear fold.\n\n**My action**: Fold. This is an easy decision. I'm out of position with a weak hand against what appears to be a strong range from a tight player. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

I have to act first on every street, which is a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 173 chips, which is about 21.6 BB. This is a medium-short stack in tournament play. I need to be careful but also look for spots to accumulate chips.\n\n4. **Opponents**: I should check what I know about the players still to act (seats 2, 3, and 4).\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 12, which is 1.5:1 odds. Not great odds for a marginal hand.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 21.6 BB, I'm not in immediate danger, but I shouldn't be playing marginal hands from early position.

It's suited but very low. From early position, I should be playing very tight. \n\nHowever, I have a decent stack size and the players behind me have shown they can be aggressive. Let me think about the pros and cons:\n\nPros of calling:\n- Suited connector that can make strong hands (flushes, straights)\n- I'm deep enough (21.6 BB) to see flops with speculative hands\n- Pot odds are good (calling 8 to win 12 = 1.5:1)\n\nCons of calling:\n- UTG is the worst position - I'll act first on all streets\n- Hand is very weak - dominated by many hands\n- Risk of facing a raise behind me\n- Tournament considerations - I should be tighter in early position\n\nGiven I'm UTG with a marginal suited connector, and I have position disadvantage, the correct play is to fold. This hand is not strong enough to play from early position in a tournament setting. I need to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.\n\nLooking at my recent history, I've been selective and that's good. I should continue that strategy.",

It's not suited connectors (gap between 5 and 9), no pair, low cards. This is a folding hand in most situations.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position, but that doesn't make up for the terrible hand.\n\n**Stack**: 165 chips (20.6 BB) - This is a relatively healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 24 chips\n- SB (Seat 5) posted 4\n- I posted BB 8\n- Everyone folded to SB who raised to 16 (a min-raise from the SB)\n\nI need to call 8 more chips to see the flop.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n- They raise frequently from SB position (hands 36, 37, 40, 45, 46)\n- They made a huge raise of 127 chips in hand 46 (all-in?)\n- They fold a lot too (hands 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 47, 48)\n- When they do raise, they often continuation bet on flop but sometimes fold to pressure\n\nThe raise to 16 from SB is a min-raise (from 8 to 16). This could be a steal attempt or could be a strong hand.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, so 3:1 pot odds. But with 5c9c, I'm very unlikely to have the best hand. Even if I hit a pair, I'll likely be dominated.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 20.6 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. 5c9c is just too weak to call a raise, even from the button. The opponent could be stealing, but I don't have a hand that can fight back effectively. I should save my chips for a better spot.",

This is a medium stack in tournament terms - not desperate, but not deep either.\n\n4. **Opponent**: Only the BB (Kimi-K2) is left to act. Looking at their history:\n   - They've been folding a LOT preflop (folded in hands 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49)\n   - Only raised once in hand 43 (raised to 24 preflop)\n   - At showdown, they've shown Jc-9h (very weak) and Ac-Jh (stronger)\n   - This opponent appears to be tight/passive, folding most hands\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 12 chips (3:1 odds)\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 20 BB, I should be somewhat selective but can take some risks, especially in position.\n\nWith Ace-rag offsuit on the button against a tight opponent who folds a lot, this is a clear raise situation. I want to:\n- Steal the blinds (which are already 12 chips)\n- Take advantage of my position\n- Apply pressure to a tight opponent\n- The minimum raise is 16 chips, which is 2 BB. This is a standard steal size.\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to fold preflop (7 out of 9 recent hands), a raise here has good fold equity. Even if called, I have position and an Ace which could be good postflop.\n\nI should raise to 16 chips (minimum raise). This risks 12 additional chips to win 12 chips, which is profitable given the opponent's folding frequency.\n\nLet me consider if I should raise more. Given I have 20 BB and this is a steal attempt, the minimum raise is appropriate. It keeps my risk low while still applying pressure.",

Only raised once in hand 43. Seems to be playing very few hands.\n- Seat 3 (BB): Relatively active, has folded a lot recently but did raise in hand 48. In hand 43, they called a raise and then bet on flop and turn.\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n2h 9c is a terrible hand:\n- Not suited\n- No connectivity (gap of 6 ranks)\n- Low card values\n- Very low playability post-flop\n\n**Position analysis:**\nEven though I'm on the button (best position), this hand is simply too weak to play. The only consideration might be to try to steal the blinds if the opponents are very tight.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n- SB has been extremely tight, folding 7 hands in a row. They might fold to a steal attempt.\n- BB has been more active but still folds frequently. They did defend once with a raise in hand 48.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 21.6 BB, which is a decent stack. I don't need to take unnecessary risks with garbage hands.\n\n**Decision:**\nEven though I have position and the opponents seem tight, 2h 9c is just too weak to play. The hand has almost no post-flop potential. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nIf I were to raise as a steal:\n- Minimum raise would be to 16 (2x BB)\n- Risking 16 chips to win 12\n- Need both to fold ~57% of the time to break even\n- Given SB's tightness, they might fold often, but BB has shown willingness to defend\n\nBut with such a weak hand, it's better to preserve chips and fold. The risk/reward isn't worth it with 2h 9c.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2h 9c is an extremely weak, unsuited, disconnected low hand with no playability.

It's dominated by many Ax hands, and the 4 kicker is very weak. This is typically a fold from UTG.\n\n**Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. I'll be out of position postflop against everyone.\n\n**Stack Size**: I have 173 chips (21.6 BB). This is a relatively healthy stack, but not deep enough to play marginal hands from bad position.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**: From the recent actions I can see:\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) just folded preflop in the previous hand\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) seems passive (checked through in Hand 51, then folded to a river bet)\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) seems more aggressive (made a river bet in Hand 51)\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With 21.6 BB, I should be selective. A4o from UTG is a clear fold. I don't want to risk chips with a marginal hand out of position. If I call or raise, I'm likely dominated by better Ax hands or pairs.\n\n**Pot Odds**: 8 chips to call, but this is irrelevant with such a weak hand from this position.\n\nDecision: Fold. This is a clear fold from UTG with A4o. The hand has poor equity against the calling/raising ranges from other players, and I'll be out of position postflop.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: Ts 3d (Ten of spades, Three of diamonds) - This is a weak hand, offsuit and disconnected\n- Position: BTN (Button) - This is excellent position\n- Stack: 165 chips (20.6 BB) - This is a relatively short stack\n- Pot: 16 chips (2 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Everyone folded to GPT-OSS-120B in SB who just called (limped) the 4 chip small blind\n- It's my turn in the BB and there's nothing to call (amount to call is 0)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions (Seat 5):\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52)\n- They've raised a few times (hands 40, 45, 46, 49)\n- They called in hand 53 preflop and then folded on the flop after checking\n- In hand 46 they made a big raise (127 chips) preflop\n\nThe pattern suggests they play relatively tight, folding most hands but occasionally raising with strong hands. The fact that they just limped from SB suggests they might have a marginal hand.\n\n**My decision:**\nWith Ts3d, this is a very weak hand. However:\n1. I'm on the button (best position)\n2. There's only one opponent who limped from SB\n3. I have a short stack (20.6 BB)\n4. The pot is small (16 chips)\n\nGiven my weak hand, I should just check and see a free flop. Raising would be risky with such a weak hand and a short stack. Even though I'm in position, Ts3d has very little potential. I could consider a small raise to steal the pot, but with my stack size, I need to be more selective.\n\nThe best play here is to check and hope to hit something on the flop, or bluff later if the situation is favorable.",

Ten high.\n\n**Board**: 4s 9c 6c - There are clubs on the board, but I don't have a club draw. I have no straight draw either.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN) which is good position.\n\n**Stack**: 165 chips (20.6 BB) - This is a decent stack, not short-stacked yet.\n\n**Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 (SB) - They have 107 chips (13.4 BB), so they're shorter stacked.\n\n**Action**: Preflop they called from the small blind (after I checked as BB), and now they've checked on the flop. The pot is 16 chips.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, I can see:\n- Hand 46: They made a big raise (127 chips, which sounds like all-in or close to it)\n- Hands 47, 48, 50, 51, 52: They folded preflop\n- Hand 49: They raised to 16 preflop\n- Hand 53: They called 16 preflop, checked flop, then folded\n\nSo they seem to be playing relatively tight, folding often preflop. When they do play, sometimes they raise, sometimes they just call. In hand 53, they checked the flop and folded, suggesting they might give up easily when they miss.\n\n**Current situation**: I have nothing - just Ten high. The board is 4-9-6 with two clubs. I have no draw. My opponent checked to me.\n\n**Decision**: I should check. I have a very weak hand with no potential. There's no reason to bluff here as:\n1. My hand has no equity\n2.

I have nothing - just T-high. The board shows 4s 9c 6c Qd, so I have no pair, no straight draw, no flush draw. My hand is complete garbage.\n\nLet me think about this:\n1. **Hand strength**: I have absolutely nothing. Ten-high on a board with Q-9-6-4 with clubs possible. This is a very weak hand.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position, but with this hand it doesn't matter much.\n3. **Opponent**: Only Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is in the hand with me. They have 107 chips (13.4 BB). They've checked both flop and turn, which suggests weakness.\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 16 chips and it costs me 0 to see the river if I check.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 20.6 BB, which is a decent stack. Seat 5 has 13.4 BB and is shorter stacked.\n\nI could consider a bluff here since opponent has shown weakness by checking twice. However:\n- I have zero equity if called\n- The board has some draws (club flush draw, straight draw possibilities)\n- I don't know this opponent's tendencies yet\n\nGiven that I have absolute air and no outs, the standard play is to check behind and see a free river card.

Just ten high on a board with Ace, Queen, 9, 6, 4. No pair, no draw, nothing.\n\nOpponent tendencies (GPT-OSS-120B):\n- From the recent actions, they've been folding a lot preflop (hands 47, 48, 50, 51, 52)\n- They made a big raise in hand 46 (127 chips)\n- Made a smaller raise in hand 49 (16 chips)\n- Called in hand 53 and then folded on the flop\n\nThe opponent seems to be playing somewhat tight/passive. They've checked to me on the river after checking the flop and turn.\n\nGiven:\n1. I have complete air (ten high)\n2. The opponent has shown passive tendencies\n3. There's 16 chips in the pot\n4. I have position\n\nThis is a good spot for a small bluff. The opponent has shown weakness by checking all three streets. The Ace on the river could be scary for them if they have a marginal hand. A small bet might get them to fold hands like 9x, 6x, small pairs, etc.\n\nHowever, I need to consider:\n- My stack is 165 chips (20.6 BB)\n- The opponent has 107 chips\n- Minimum raise is 8 chips\n\nA bet of around 8-12 chips would be appropriate here. It's a small risk for a chance to win 16 chips. That's good value.\n\nLet me bet 10 chips as a bluff. This is about 62.5% of the pot - a reasonable bluff size. If they call, I'm done with the hand and will lose 10 chips, but if they fold, I win 16 chips.\n\nActually, looking at the format, if I want to bet 10 chips, I need to \"raise_to\": 10 since the amount to call is 0.\n\nWait, I should reconsider. Let me think about the board texture:\n- 4s 9c 6c Qd As\nThis is a somewhat scary board. The Ace on the river is a big card. If they had a hand like 9x, 6x, or a small pocket pair, they might be worried about the Ace.\n\nGiven their passivity and the fact they've checked all streets, a small bluff seems profitable. I'll go with a bet of 10 chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the sizing. The pot is 16, so a bet of 8 (minimum) to 12 would be appropriate. I'll go with 10 chips as a solid 62.5% pot bet.\n\nWait, I need to use the correct action format. Since there's nothing to call (amount to call is 0), I should use \"check\" if I want to check, but if I want to bet, I use \"raise\" with raise_to being the total amount I want to put in.\n\nSo if I want to bet 10 chips, I should:\n- action: \"raise\"\n- raise_to: 10\n\nLet me make that decision.",

It's unsuited and disconnected.\n\n**My position: SB** - I'm out of position for the entire hand.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- Me: 177 chips (22.1 BB)\n- BB: 228 chips\n- GPT-OSS-120B (raiser): 91 chips (11.4 BB) - This is important, they're short-stacked\n\n**The action:**\n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 28 chips (4 from me, 8 from BB, 16 from raiser)\n- I need to call 12 more chips to see the flop\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nGPT-OSS-120B has been relatively conservative:\n- Folded 2 hands in a row (hands 51, 52)\n- Called 16 in hand 53 then folded on flop\n- Called 4 in hand 54 (likely BB) then checked down and folded on river\n\nThis suggests they're not super aggressive. Their raise to 16 (2x the BB) from the CO position with a short stack could be:\n1. A legitimate strong hand\n2. A steal attempt with position\n3. Desperation play with a short stack\n\n**Pot odds:** \nI need to call 12 to win 28, so 12:28 or roughly 2.33:1. This means I need ~30% equity to break even.\n\n**My hand equity:** 9-2 offsuit has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against random hands, 9-2o only has about 35% equity, and against a tight raising range it would be much worse (likely < 25%).\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (22 BB)\n- The raiser is short-stacked (11.4 BB) and may be getting desperate\n- However, playing 9-2o out of position is a recipe for disaster\n- If I call and miss the flop (which is very likely), I'll be in a tough spot out of position\n- I could potentially squeeze raise to isolate the short stack, but with 9-2o this is very risky\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. 9-2o is unplayable in this spot, especially out of position. Even though the raise is small and the pot odds seem okay, the reverse implied odds are terrible. I'll lose much more than 12 chips when I hit a weak hand like top pair with a 9 and get outkicked, or when I completely miss and have to fold to continuation bets.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9-2 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker.

I need to build the pot and extract value. I also want to thin the field - while aces are strong, they don't play well multi-way.\n\nLet me think about sizing:\n- Standard raise would be 2.5-3x the big blind, so 20-24 chips\n- Given my stack is 22.1 BB, I could also consider a larger raise or even shove\n- But with aces, I want action, so I don't want to shove and scare everyone away\n- A raise to 24 (3x BB) seems reasonable\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here - pocket aces are an obvious raise in any situation.

There are no completed straights or flushes. The only draws are:\n- 3-4 or 4-5 for a straight\n- Any two spades for a flush draw\n\nWith pocket aces on this board, I have an overpair - currently the best hand most of the time. \n\nPot odds: 26 to win 78, so 3:1 pot odds. This is an easy call, but I should consider raising for value and protection.\n\nI need to think about:\n1. **Protection**: There are some draws possible (spade flush draw, straight draws). I should charge draws.\n2. **Value**: DeepSeek likely has something decent since they called preflop and bet flop. Could be a pair, two pair, or a draw.\n3. **Stack size**: I have 153 chips. If I raise, I need to think about the sizing.\n\nThe minimum raise is to 52 (26 + 26). I could also go all-in.\n\nLet me think about standard raise sizing. The bet is 26 into 78, so about 1/3 pot. A standard raise would be to about 3x their bet or more, so around 78-104 chips.\n\nGiven my stack is 153, a raise to around 80-90 would:\n- Charge draws appropriately\n- Build the pot with my strong hand\n- Not commit my entire stack yet, leaving room for later streets\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 153 chips and the pot already at 78, if I raise to say 90:\n- Pot becomes 168\n- I have ~63 left\n- This essentially commits me anyway\n\nA better approach might be to either:\n1. Raise smaller (like 60-70) to keep the pot manageable\n2. Go all-in now to maximize fold equity and protect against draws\n\nBut wait - going all-in with aces on this relatively safe board might be overkill. The opponent bet 26, which suggests they have something. If I go all-in, they might fold hands I'm ahead of, like 7x, 6x, 2x, or draws.\n\nLet me think about the opponent's range. They called my 3x raise preflop from the BB. That suggests:\n- Pocket pairs (22-QQ)\n- Some suited connectors\n- Some broadway cards\n- Maybe A-x suited\n\nOn this flop (2c 6s 7s), if they have:\n- A set (222, 666, 777): I'm crushed, but that's unlikely with only one of each card on board\n- Two pair (76, 72, 62): I'm behind, but also unlikely they called preflop with these\n- One pair (7x, 6x, 2x): I'm ahead\n- Overpair (88-QQ): I'm ahead\n- Draws: I'm ahead\n\nSo I'm ahead of most of their range.

That's about 2.9x their bet, which is reasonable.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise again - it's to 52 total. That's only adding 26 more. That seems too small. I should raise more.\n\nLet me think about tournament dynamics. I have 19 BB, which is a decent stack but not huge. I don't want to get into a tricky spot on later streets. With aces, I want to get value now.\n\nA good sizing would be to raise to about 75-85 total. Let me go with 78 to match the pot size, or maybe a bit more.\n\nActually, let me be more aggressive. The board has some draw potential. I should charge them. I'll raise to 80 total.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. If I"

If I raise, I need to think about the sizing.\n\nThe minimum raise is to 52 (26 + 26). I could also go all-in.\n\nLet me think about standard raise sizing. The bet is 26 into 78, so about 1/3 pot. A standard raise would be to about 3x their bet or more, so around 78-104 chips.\n\nGiven my stack is 153, a raise to around 80-90 would:\n- Charge draws appropriately\n- Build the pot with my strong hand\n- Not commit my entire stack yet, leaving room for later streets\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 153 chips and the pot already at 78, if I raise to say 90:\n- Pot becomes 168\n- I have ~63 left\n- This essentially commits me anyway\n\nA better approach might be to either:\n1. Raise smaller (like 60-70) to keep the pot manageable\n2. Go all-in now to maximize fold equity and protect against draws\n\nBut wait - going all-in with aces on this relatively safe board might be overkill. The opponent bet 26, which suggests they have something. If I go all-in, they might fold hands I'm ahead of, like 7x, 6x, 2x, or draws.\n\nLet me think about the opponent's range. They called my 3x raise preflop from the BB. That suggests:\n- Pocket pairs (22-QQ)\n- Some suited connectors\n- Some broadway cards\n- Maybe A-x suited\n\nOn this flop (2c 6s 7s), if they have:\n- A set (222, 666, 777): I'm crushed, but that's unlikely with only one of each card on board\n- Two pair (76, 72, 62): I'm behind, but also unlikely they called preflop with these\n- One pair (7x, 6x, 2x): I'm ahead\n- Overpair (88-QQ): I'm ahead\n- Draws: I'm ahead\n\nSo I'm ahead of most of their range. I should raise for value.\n\nGiven the pot is 78 and I need to call 26, if I raise to around 70-80:\n- I'm building the pot\n- Charging draws\n- Not overcommitting if a scary card comes\n\nLet me go with a raise to 75. That's about 2.9x their bet, which is reasonable.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise again - it's to 52 total. That's only adding 26 more. That seems too small. I should raise more.\n\nLet me think about tournament dynamics. I have 19 BB, which is a decent stack but not huge. I don't want to get into a tricky spot on later streets. With aces, I want to get value now.\n\nA good sizing would be to raise to about 75-85 total. Let me go with 78 to match the pot size, or maybe a bit more.\n\nActually, let me be more aggressive. The board has some draw potential. I should charge them. I'll raise to 80 total.\n\nWait, I need to be careful. If I",

Going all-in maximizes pressure on draws and extracts value from weaker pairs or flush draws before a scary river card can kill my action.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My position: BTN (Seat 1)\n- My cards: As Ad (pocket aces!)\n- My stack: 78 chips (9.8 BB)\n- Board: 2c 6s 7s 2s\n- Pot: 202 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (DeepSeek-V3.2 checked)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have pocket aces on a board of 2c 6s 7s 2s. This is a very strong hand, but the board is concerning:\n- There are two 2s, so full houses are possible\n- Three spades (6s, 7s, 2s) means a flush draw is out there\n- The board is somewhat coordinated with 6-7\n\nHowever, I still have a very strong hand. Let me think about the betting:\n- Preflop: I raised to 24, DeepSeek-V3.2 called\n- Flop: DeepSeek-V3.2 bet 26, I raised to 75, they called 49\n- Turn: DeepSeek-V3.2 checked\n\nThe fact that they bet on the flop and then checked the turn suggests they might have been on a draw or have a medium-strength hand. They could have:\n- A flush draw (spades)\n- A straight draw\n- A pair (like 6x, 7x)\n- Or they could have a monster and be trapping\n\n**My stack situation:**\nI only have 78 chips left, and the pot is 202 chips. This is a critical tournament situation. I have about 9.8 BB left.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the search results, I can see DeepSeek-V3.2 has been fairly active. They:\n- Raised preflop in hand 48 with unknown cards\n- Called preflop in hand 52 with A4\n- Raised preflop in hand 53 with unknown cards and made a 35 chip bet on the flop\n- Folded multiple times as well\n\nThey seem to be a thinking player who can both raise and fold.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that I have pocket aces, the pot is already 202 chips, and I only have 78 chips left, I should be looking to get all my chips in. The turn check from my opponent could mean:\n1. They're giving up on a draw\n2. They're scared of the flush\n3. They're trapping with a monster\n\nBut with pocket aces, I can't afford to just check here. I need to:\n1. Protect my hand against draws\n2. Extract value from worse hands\n3. Take down the pot now if they're weak\n\nSince I can only raise to 49 minimum, but I have 78 total, I should just go all-in. This maximizes pressure and gives draws bad odds to call.\n\nLet me check if raising to 49 (the minimum) makes sense vs going all-in. Given my short stack and the pot size, going all-in is much better. If I raise to 49, I'm leaving 29 chips behind which is awkward.\n\nActually, wait. Let me re-read the rules. The \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount I'm putting in. So if I want to go all-in with my remaining 78 chips, I should set \"raise_to\": 78.\n\nBut I need to check if 78 is at least the minimum raise of 49. Yes, 78 > 49, so it's a valid raise.\n\nThe key here is that with pocket aces on this board, facing a check, and with a short stack, I should be betting for value and protection. Going all-in puts maximum pressure and ensures I realize my equity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3h Td - This is a very weak hand (3 and 10 offsuit), no suitedness, no connectedness, and the 3 is very low.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table, I have to act first on all postflop streets.\n\n3. **Stack**: 280 chips (35 BB) - This is a decent stack, not desperate but not huge either.\n\n4. **Blinds**: 4/8 - So it's 8 to call.\n\n5. **Opponents**: Looking at the opponent data:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4/SB): Has been very tight, folding most hands preflop. In the last 10 hands, they folded 8 times preflop and checked once from BB.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5/BB): Mixed play - sometimes calls, sometimes folds, sometimes raises. They raised to 16 in hand 55 from BB.\n\n6. **My recent history**: Looking at my last 15 hands, I've been playing very tight - folding most hands preflop. I only raised with premium hands (AA in hand 56, A2s in hand 50). This is appropriate for tournament play.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- 3h Td is a trash hand, especially from UTG\n- From UTG, I should only be playing premium hands (pairs, AK, AQ, maybe AJ suited, KQ suited)\n- Even if I hit a T on the flop, I could be dominated by better kickers\n- Even if I hit a 3, I'm unlikely to have the best hand\n- There's no flush or straight potential worth mentioning\n- I'm out of position against all opponents\n- The pot odds are 12:8 (1.5:1) which is not enough to justify playing this hand\n\n**Decision**: Clear fold. This is a standard fold in any position, but especially from UTG with this hand strength.\n\nI should not call or raise with this hand. It's simply too weak and I'll be out of position throughout the hand. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.",

Very weak, no connectivity, suited potential, or high card value.\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position post-flop which is a huge disadvantage\n3. **Opponent raise**: SB is raising into the BB, which typically indicates strength\n4. **Stack preservation**: I have a healthy stack and don't need to gamble with garbage\n5. **Implied odds**: Very low with this hand - even if I hit a pair, I'll likely be dominated\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, I'm out of position, facing a raise, and have no compelling reason to defend with such a poor holding.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: Kd Jh (King of diamonds, Jack of hearts) - This is a decent but not premium hand. It's suited in diamonds, which gives some potential.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position post-flop, I get to act last.\n\n**Stack**: 268 chips (33.5 BB) - Healthy stack, above 30 BB.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 28 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 raised to 16 (2x the big blind)\n- I need to call 12 to see the flop\n- Minimum raise is to 24\n\nLet me analyze MiniMax-M2's tendencies from the data:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been very tight, folding most hands preflop\n- They raised to 16 in hand 58 (same sizing as now)\n- In hand 59, they called 8, then called 16, then called 30 on flop before folding on turn\n- They seem to play straightforwardly - raises likely indicate strength\n\nSince they've been folding frequently and this is their second raise in recent hands, this raise likely indicates a strong hand range (premium pairs, strong broadway hands).\n\n**My hand equity**: KJ suited is decent but dominated by many hands in a tight player's raising range (AK, AQ, AJ, KQ). I have about 40-45% equity against a typical raising range.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 12 to win 28 chips, getting about 2.3:1 odds. This is marginal with KJ suited.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have 33.5 BB, which is comfortable but not huge\n- The blinds are relatively high (4/8)\n- I need to accumulate chips, but I don't want to get into marginal spots against a tight player\n\n**Decision**: With KJ suited on the button, getting 2.3:1 pot odds against a tight player who just raised, I should:\n1. Fold - too marginal against a tight player's range, risk of being dominated\n2. Call - could be profitable with position and suited hand\n3. Raise - would be aggressive but risky against a tight player\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 is tight and this is a raise (not just a limp), their range is strong. KJ suited is often dominated by their range. While I have position, the risk of being dominated and the marginal pot odds suggest folding is the safest play. However, with 33.5 BB, I can afford to see a flop in position with a decent suited hand.\n\nI think calling is the best option - I have position, a suited hand with good potential, and enough chips to see the flop. If I hit, I can potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Against a tight player who raises, KJ is often dominated. The pot odds aren't great (2.3:1). And while I have position, I'm risking 12 chips (1.5 BB) on a marginal hand. \n\nI think folding is the most disciplined play here. Save my chips for better spots against this tight player.",

Better to wait for a stronger hand or better situation.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the hand:\n\n**My Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (best position)\n- Cards: 2s Qh (offsuit, weak hand)\n- Stack: 268 chips (16.8 BB) - getting short\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Need to call: 16\n- Minimum raise: 32\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n\n**Seat 2 (SB - Kimi-K2):**\n- Very tight player - folded preflop in 6 of last 8 hands\n- Only raised once (hand 57) with 24\n- No showdowns shown recently\n- This is a very conservative player\n\n**Seat 3 (BB - DeepSeek-V3.2):**\n- Also fairly tight - folded 4 of last 5 hands\n- Called once and then bet aggressively postflop in hand 56\n- No showdowns shown\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Q2o is a very weak hand, even on the button\n- Only 16.8 BB left, so we're in push/fold territory\n- From the BTN with a short stack, we could consider raising as a steal\n- However, both opponents seem tight, so they might fold to a steal attempt\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Hand strength: Very weak (Q2o)\n2. Position: Excellent (BTN)\n3. Stack size: Short (16.8 BB) - need to be careful\n4. Opponents: Both appear tight, which favors a steal attempt\n5. Pot odds: Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1) - not great for this hand\n\nGiven my short stack and tight opponents, I could consider a steal raise here. A standard steal from BTN with 16.8 BB would be to raise to about 2.5-3x BB, so around 40-48 chips. But I need to be careful - if either opponent calls or re-raises, I'm in trouble with Q2o.\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\n- I only have 16.8 BB\n- Q2o is a terrible hand\n\n\n- The SB has folded 6 of last 8 hands\n- The BB has folded 4 of last 5 hands\n\nI'll take a calculated risk and attempt a steal. With such tight opponents and my position, a 3x BB raise to 48 chips seems like a strategic move. The potential to pick up the blinds outweighs the risk of a weak hand, given the opponents' tendency to fold frequently.\n\nThe pot represents a solid 9% stack increase, making it a tempting opportunity. However, the tight playing styles of opponents suggest they'll likely only continue with premium hands. My position on the button provides some strategic advantage, but the weak Q2o hand still makes direct confrontation risky.\n\nConservative play seems prudent here. Folding minimizes potential losses and preserves my limited stack for more promising future opportunities. The current hand simply doesn't offer compelling enough odds to justify aggressive action.\n\nI'll fold and wait for a stronger position or more favorable hand dynamics.",

It's unsuited and disconnected low cards. This is a clear fold in almost all situations.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - you have to act first post-flop and there are 7 players left to act behind you. This makes playing marginal hands even more dangerous.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 16.8 BB is a short stack, but not desperate yet. With a short stack, we need to be selective about which hands we play. 65o is definitely not a hand to risk our tournament life on.\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: With 16.8 BB, we should be looking for spots to either shove all-in preflop with strong hands or steal blinds from late position. Playing speculative hands like 65o from UTG with a short stack is -EV.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: We need to call 16 to win 24, which is 1.5:1 odds. Even with these odds, 65o is just too weak, especially from UTG.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. We should preserve our stack for better opportunities.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold based on basic poker fundamentals. 65o from UTG with a short stack is an easy fold, no need to recall opponent tendencies.",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: 3h Qd (offsuit, very weak hand)\n- Stack: 252 chips (15.8 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 193 chips\n- Action: Seat 3 raised to 169 (which is essentially all-in since they have 0 chips left)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nSeat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has been very tight - folding preflop in hands 57, 58, 59, 60, 63. They raised in hand 61 and called in hand 62 (which they folded on the flop). This suggests they raise with relatively strong hands.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Amount to call: 153 chips\n- Pot: 193 chips\n- Pot odds: 193:153 or about 1.26:1\n- Required equity: ~44%\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nQ3o is a very weak hand. Even against a random hand, it only has about 48% equity. Against a tight player's raising range (like 15-20% of hands), Q3o has terrible equity - likely less than 30%.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 15.8 BB left\n- This is a significant portion of my stack (60% if I call)\n- Preserving my stack is important, but so is accumulating chips\n- However, Q3o is simply too weak to call such a large raise\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. Q3o is trash, especially against a tight player who has shown strength. Even if they were loose, calling 60% of my stack with Q3o would be terrible. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify calling with such a weak hand.\n\nThe opponent has 0 chips left, meaning they're all-in. I need to call 153 chips to win 193. This is essentially a tournament life decision with Q3o. Easy fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent in the big blind (Seat 2, also Kimi-K2) has been playing quite tight. Looking at their preflop actions:\n\n- Folded many times: hands 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 60, 63, 64 (11 folds)\n- Called: hand 51 (4 chips), hand 61 (8 chips then folded)\n- Raised: hand 57 (24 chips), hand 62 (40 chips)\n\nThis is a tight player who defends their big blind selectively. They have shown they can fold to steals.\n\nMy situation:\n- Position: BTN (excellent position)\n- Hand: Tc 3c (very weak, offsuit but suited connector - still very marginal)\n- Stack: 244 chips (15.2 BB) - relatively short\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 8 chips (getting 3:1 odds)\n\nWith T3s on the button facing a tight BB, I have a few options:\n\n1. **Fold**: Safe play, preserves stack. T3s is a very weak hand.\n2. **Call**: Getting decent odds (3:1), but I'll be out of position postflop and the hand has poor playability.\n3. **Raise (steal)**: Try to win the blinds now. Minimum raise to 32 chips would risk 24 to win 24. \n\nGiven that the BB is tight and has folded to pressure before, a steal attempt could work. However, I'm risking 24 chips (about 10% of my stack) with a very weak hand. \n\nWith 15.2 BB, I'm in the \"danger zone\" where I need to be careful with my chips. While stealing from the button is generally good, T3s is just too weak to risk 10% of my stack, especially when the BB has shown they can defend with raises.\n\nThe call is tempting getting 3:1 odds, but I'll be out of position and this hand flops poorly most of the time. It's a \"fit or fold\" hand that will often miss completely.\n\nI think the best play is to **fold**. Preserve my chips for better spots. I have a marginal hand and while the opponent is tight, risking chips with T3s when I'm already short-stacked is not optimal.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The search didn't return any results, but I can see that Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has only 8 chips left, which is less than 1 big blind. This means they're in the small blind and will be all-in automatically. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted the big blind with 98 chips.\n\nLet me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 5s Td - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. In UTG position, this is definitely a fold in normal circumstances.\n\n2. **My position**: UTG (first to act) - This is the worst position, so I should only play premium hands.\n\n3. **Opponent stacks**: \n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has only 8 chips and is all-in from the small blind\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 98 chips and posted the big blind\n   - I have 244 chips (15.2 BB)\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 24 chips (8 from SB + 16 from BB). I need to call 16 to see the flop. This gives me 1.5:1 pot odds, which is not great.\n\n5. **Special situation**: Since Seat 3 is all-in with only 8 chips, there's a potential side pot situation. If I call, I'll be competing against Seat 4's 16-chip big blind, but Seat 3 can only win 8 chips from each of us.\n\n6. **Hand strength**: My hand is very weak. Even against a random hand from the all-in player, I'm not in great shape. Against a typical big blind defending range, I'm crushed.\n\nThe key consideration here is: should I call 16 chips to try to win the 8 chips from the all-in player plus potentially more from the big blind?\n\nGiven that:\n- My hand is extremely weak (T5 offsuit)\n- I'm in the worst position (UTG)\n- I have a healthy stack of 15.2 BB and don't need to take marginal spots\n- The potential gain is small (24 chips) compared to the risk (16 chips)\n- I have no information suggesting the big blind is weak\n\nThis is a clear fold. I should preserve my chips for better opportunities. The presence of the all-in short stack doesn't change the fundamental weakness of my hand and position.",

Even with these odds, 9-6 offsuit performs poorly against a strong range\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 14.2 BB, I should be looking for better spots. While I could defend the blind with a stronger hand, 9-6 offsuit is just too weak\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. Even though I'm getting decent pot odds and have position, 9-6 offsuit is simply not a hand I should be defending with, especially against a tight opponent who likely has a strong range. I should preserve my chips for a better opportunity.",

Let me check the current hand again.\n\nActually, looking at the hand history, it says \"Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 0 chips (out)\" but the actions show they raised to 56. This seems contradictory. Let me assume they're still in and raised to 56.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the recall data, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been very active with preflop raises:\n- Multiple raises varying from 6 to 177 chips\n- Showdowns show they played A6 (which I have now) and KK\n- They seem aggressive preflop\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- A6 offsuit is a marginal hand, especially with a low kicker\n- On the button, I have position advantage\n- My stack is 13.8 BB - this is a critical decision point\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- To call: 48 chips\n- Pot odds: 80:48 or 1.67:1\n- This means I need ~37.5% equity to call\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- With 13.8 BB, I'm in the danger zone\n- I need to be thinking about preserving my stack or finding good spots to accumulate\n- A6 offsuit is not a premium hand, but it's not terrible either\n- The opponent is aggressive, which could mean they're raising wide\n\n**Options:**\n1. Fold - Safest, preserves my 220 stack\n2. Call 48 - Pot is 80, I'd be calling 48 more. After call, pot would be 128, I'd have 172 left (10.75 BB)\n3. Raise to 96 (minimum) or more - This would commit me significantly\n\nGiven my stack size and the marginal nature of A6 offsuit, I think this is a fold. The opponent's aggression suggests they could have a better Ace or any pocket pair. With only 13.8 BB, I should be more selective and wait for a better spot or a premium hand to shove with.\n\nHowever, I am on the button, and if the opponent is raising wide, A6 might be ahead of their range. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, with 13.8 BB, I should be looking for spots to either fold or go all-in. A min-raise to 96 would leave me with 124 chips (7.75 BB), which is very awkward. If I call 48, I have 172 left.\n\nI think the best play here is to **fold**. A6 offsuit is too weak to commit chips with when I'm this short, and I should wait for a better opportunity to get my money in good.",

Seems aggressive with 3 raises in last 4 hands where it acted.\n- **MiniMax-M2 (BB)**: Has been very tight, folding most hands. Only played hand 71 where it called twice preflop but then checked down all streets. Now has only 10 chips left (extremely short stack).\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Td 2d is trash. Worst possible starting hand in early position.\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act on all streets.\n3. **Stack depth**: At 13.8 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I should be very selective about hands I play.\n4. **Opponent reads**: \n   - DeepSeek has been aggressive, likely to defend SB or even raise\n   - MiniMax is extremely short (10 chips) and might shove or fold\n5. **Pot odds**: 16 to win 24 = 1.5:1, which is not enough to justify playing this garbage hand\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With a short stack, I need to preserve chips for better spots. T2s is not a hand I want to play UTG, especially when facing an aggressive opponent in the blinds.\n\n**Decision**: This is an easy fold. T2s is unplayable from UTG with a short stack, especially against an aggressive opponent.\n\nI need to fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent data for Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n\n1. **Preflop tendencies**: They fold frequently (hands 59, 60, 63, 64, 68-73), but when they do raise, they tend to raise to 48 chips (hands 62, 66, 67). This current raise of 48 is consistent with their pattern.\n\n2. **Showdown hands**: They've shown down with Qh Qs (hand 66), Ah Js (hand 67), Jh Ac (hand 36), and 9h Jc (hand 30). So they do play strong hands like pocket queens, AJ, but also some weaker hands like J9.\n\n3. **Current situation**: \n   - I have A\u2663 3\u2660 on the button\n   - Stack: 204 chips (12.8 BB)\n   - Blinds: 8/16\n   - Pot: 72 chips\n   - Need to call 32 chips to see flop\n   - Minimum raise to 80\n\n4. **Hand analysis**: \n   - A3o is a marginal hand, especially out of position (even though I'm on BTN, the raiser is in earlier position)\n   - I'm dominated by many AX hands that opponent could have\n   - Only 12.8 BB left - this is a short stack situation\n   - Pot odds: 32 to win 72 = 2.25:1 or about 31% equity needed\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - With 12.8 BB, I'm in the danger zone\n   - I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call raises\n   - A3o is not strong enough to call a raise with this stack depth\n   - If I call 32, I'll have 172 left (10.75 BB) and will be pot-committed on many flops\n\n6. **Opponent's raise size**: 48 chips is 3x the big blind, which is a standard raise size for them. They do this with both strong hands (QQ, AJ) and presumably some weaker hands.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. A3o is too weak to call a raise with a short stack, and I'm not deep enough to speculate. I should preserve my chips for a better spot, preferably to shove all-in as the first raiser rather than calling off 20% of my stack with a marginal hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 2h 7s (complete trash, unsuited, low cards)\n- My position: Button (best position)\n- My stack: 196 chips (12.2 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Action back to me: I need to call 8 more chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Kimi-K2 in BB):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see:\n- This opponent has been folding a LOT preflop (hands 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73 all folded)\n- But when they do raise, they raise to 48 (3x BB) - seen in hands 67 and 74\n- In hand 66, they had pocket Queens and won\n- In hand 67, they had AJ and won\n- They seem to play tight but aggressive when they enter pots\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n- I'm on the Button, which is great position\n- Everyone else has folded\n- It's heads-up against the BB\n\n**Stack Size Considerations:**\n- I have 12.2 BB, which is short but not desperate yet\n- I need to be careful with stack preservation\n- However, with my position and the opponent's tendency to fold a lot, I could steal\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- 2h 7s is literally one of the worst hands in poker (72 offsuit)\n- Even against a tight opponent, this hand has very little equity\n- If I get called, I'm in terrible shape\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Steal opportunity**: Opponent folds a lot preflop (6 consecutive folds before raising in hands 67 and 74)\n2. **Position**: I have button position advantage\n3. **Hand strength**: Extremely weak hand\n4. **Stack size**: Short stack, need to preserve chips\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 8 to win 24 (3:1 odds), but with this hand it doesn't matter\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Safe, preserve 12BB stack, wait for better spot\n- **Call**: Terrible with 72o, no implied odds, would be burning chips\n- **Raise**: Steal attempt. Minimum raise is 32 (2x BB, or 16 more than calling). If I raise to 32, I'm risking 24 more chips (32 total - 8 already invested) to win 24. That's 1:1 odds. If opponent folds 50%+ of the time, it's profitable.\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to fold 6 out of 8 recent hands preflop (75% fold rate), a steal raise could be profitable. However, with 72o, even if called I'm in terrible shape.\n\nBut wait - let me reconsider. With a 12BB stack, I should be thinking about shove/fold poker. A min-raise to 32 would leave me with 164 chips (10.25 BB). If I get re-raised, I have to fold and lose 32 chips (16% of my stack).\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\n- I've already posted 8 as SB\n- Pot is 24 (8 + 16 + my 8)\n- To call: 8 more chips\n- To raise min: 32 total (24 more than my SB)\n\nIf I raise to 32 and opponent folds, I win 24 chips (increase stack by ~12%).\nIf I raise to 32 and opponent calls or re-raises, I'm in trouble with 72o.\n\nWith such a weak hand, even against a tight opponent, the risk isn't worth it. I should preserve my stack for better spots, especially since I'm on the button and will have good position in future hands.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold 72o. It's one of the worst hands, and while a steal might work given opponent's tendencies, the risk to my short stack isn't worth it. I'll wait for a better hand or a better spot (like when I'm in blind vs blind or have an actual hand).",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand, I'm on the Button with 7h Ts (7 of hearts, 10 of spades). I have 196 chips which is about 12.2 big blinds. The blinds are 8/16.\n\nThe pot is currently 26 chips (8 from SB, 16 from BB, and 2 from Seat 4 who called 2 chips - this seems odd, probably a small blind posted by a player who just entered or something).\n\nI need to call 16 chips to see the flop.\n\nLet me think about this:\n1. My hand: 7h Ts is not a strong hand. It's offsuit and not connected. This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n2. My position: I'm on the Button which is good position, but with a weak hand like this, position doesn't help much.\n3. My stack: I have 12.2 BB which is getting short. I need to be selective and look for good spots to shove or fold.\n4. Opponent tendencies: Let me look at what I found from the opponent actions.\n\nFrom the opponent actions I can see:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3, BB) has been active - they called in hand 72, made a big raise of 184 in hand 73 (likely all-in), and folded in hand 74 and 75.\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2, SB) has been folding a lot preflop, but made a raise to 48 in hand 74.\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) is now out (0 chips)\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) folded preflop in multiple hands\n\nThe action so far: SB posted 8, BB posted 16, Seat 4 called 2 (weird), Seat 5 folded. It's now on me on the Button.\n\nWith 7h Ts and 12.2 BB, this is a clear fold. \n\nI'm on the Button with 7h Ts, a weak offsuit hand. With only 12.2 big blinds, I need to preserve my stack for better opportunities. The hand doesn't have strong potential, and I'd be risking valuable chips on a marginal situation. Folding is the most prudent move to maintain my tournament life and wait for a stronger hand or better position.",

I'm UTG - the worst position\n  2. I would need to call 16 (1 BB) which is 8% of my stack\n  3. I won't realize my equity often enough to justify this call\n  4. If I hit a set, I might not get paid off enough to justify the risk\n  5. I'm likely to face raises behind me\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. Pocket deuces from UTG with a short stack is not a profitable play. I should preserve my chips for better spots, preferably when I'm in better position or have a stronger hand that I can shove with.\n\nThe reasoning is straightforward: weak hand + bad position + short stack = fold.",

Against a typical raising range (like 15-20% of hands), QTo has roughly 40-45% equity. So from a pure equity standpoint, this is a call.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** \n- I'm short-stacked at 11.2 BB\n- I have good position (BTN)\n- If I call, I'll have 148 chips left (9.25 BB)\n- If I fold, I preserve my stack but lose 16 chips\n\n**The raise:** Minimum raise is 80 which would be to 80 total (48+32). If I raise to 80, I'm putting in 64 more chips and would have 116 left (7.25 BB). This seems too committing with QTo.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. Hand strength: Decent but not premium\n2. Position: Excellent (BTN)\n3. Opponent: Seems tight, but the raise size is standard\n4. Stack size: Short-stacked, need to be careful\n5. Pot odds: Good enough to call\n\nGiven my short stack and decent hand with good position, I think calling is the best play. Folding would be too tight given the pot odds and position. Raising would commit too many chips with a marginal hand.\n\nLet me make the call.",

My hand has essentially no equity - just Q-high\n2. Opponent raised preflop and likely has a strong range\n3. I'm out of position for the rest of the hand\n4. My stack is short (9.2 BB) but not desperate yet\n5. Board is coordinated with trips possible and flush draw\n6. Checking is free - I can see if I improve on turn\n\n**Best Play:**\nI should check. I have no made hand, no draw, and the board is dangerous. The opponent's preflop raise suggests strength. With my short stack, I should preserve chips for better spots. Checking gives me a free chance to improve, but I'm likely folding to any significant bet on the turn unless I hit something strong.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the Button (BTN) with Qc Th (queen of clubs, ten of hearts)\n- My stack: 148 chips (9.2 BB)\n- Board: 9d 9s 2s (double 9s with a spade)\n- Pot: 168 chips\n- Opponent (Seat 2) bet 64 on the flop\n- I need to call 64 chips\n- Minimum raise to 128 chips\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- I have Qc Th\n- The board is 9d 9s 2s\n- I don't have a pair\n- I don't have a spade flush draw (no spades in my hand)\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (need a Jack to make Q-J-10-9-9)\n- I have two overcards (Q and T) but the board has paired 9s, making it less likely these are good\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the opponent actions I just recalled:\n- Seat 2 has been raising preflop frequently (hands 66, 67, 74 with raise of 48)\n- They called a 129 bet in hand 66\n- They showed down Qh Qs in hand 66 (so they can have legitimate hands)\n- They showed down Ah Js in hand 67 (another strong starting hand)\n- In hand 76, they checked flop and turn, then bet 24 on river\n\nThe pattern shows Seat 2 raises preflop with strong hands and is capable of continuation betting.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 168\n- I need to call 64\n- Pot odds: 168:64 or about 2.6:1\n- This means I need ~28% equity to break even\n\n**My equity:**\nWith Qc Th on a 9d 9s 2s board:\n- I have 6 outs to improve (3 Jacks for the straight, 3 Queens for top pair - though Queens might not be good if opponent has a 9 or better)\n- Actually, let me reconsider: I have 3 Jacks for the straight, and 3 Queens for top pair, but if my opponent has a 9, my Queens won't help. If they have pocket pairs higher than 9s, my Queens won't help either.\n- So realistically, I have about 3-6 clean outs\n- With one card to come (turn), that's about 6-12% equity\n- Even with two cards to come, it's around 12-24% equity\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- I have 148 chips left (9.2 BB)\n- Calling 64 would leave me with 84 chips (5.25 BB)\n- If I raise to 128, that commits most of my stack\n- I'm in a tournament with shallow stacks\n\n**Decision:**\nThe pot odds aren't good enough for my draw. I have at best 6 clean outs (the Jacks), and possibly the Queens if opponent doesn't have a 9 or better. That's not enough equity to justify calling 64 chips when I only have 148 total.\n\nI should fold and preserve my stack. I still have 9.2 BB which is playable, and I can find better spots. Calling here would commit too much of my stack on a weak draw against an opponent who has shown strength both preflop and on the flop.",

J3 offsuit is not a playable hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB (small blind), which is one of the worst positions postflop.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 140 chips, which is only 8.8 BB. This is a very short stack in tournament play.\n\n4. **Pot**: The pot is currently 40 chips (8 from SB, 16 from BB, and 16 from the call).\n\n5. **Action**: Seat 5 called the BB. This suggests they might have a decent but not premium hand.\n\n6. **Amount to call**: It's only 8 more chips to see the flop.\n\nLet me consider my options:\n- **Fold**: This is the standard play with J3o. It's a trash hand.\n- **Call**: I could call 8 chips to see the flop. With my short stack, I need to be careful, but the pot odds are decent (40:8 or 5:1).\n- **Raise**: Raising to 32 would be a squeeze play, but with J3o this is very risky and not recommended.\n\nGiven that I'm very short-stacked (8.8 BB), I should be looking for spots to shove all-in with decent hands. J3o is not a decent hand. However, I have some things to consider:\n\n- The pot is already 40 chips, which is about 28.5% of my stack\n- It only costs me 8 chips (5.7% of my stack) to see the flop\n- If I hit a miracle flop (two pair, trips, etc.), I could potentially double up\n\nBut realistically, J3o is going to miss the flop most of the time, and I'll be out of position. With a short stack, I should preserve my chips for better opportunities.\n\nHowever, let me think about tournament dynamics. With 8.8 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I should either be shoving all-in preflop with a decent hand or folding. Calling 8 chips with J3o is not optimal - it's a \"leaky\" play that will cost me chips in the long run.\n \nFolding is the most disciplined move.

It's suited (no, wait - 8d 7h is offsuit, not suited). So it's a weak suited connector... actually, it's offsuit. So it's even weaker. Not a great hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is the best position post-flop. This gives me an advantage if I see a flop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 140 chips, which is 8.8 BB. This is a short stack in tournament play. With a short stack, I need to be more selective about which hands I play, but when I do play, I should often be looking to get my chips in.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 24 chips, and I need to call 16. That's 1.5:1 pot odds. Not great.\n\n5. **Opponents**: \n   - SB (Seat 2) has 437 chips (27.3 BB) - deep stack\n   - BB (Seat 3) has 218 chips (13.6 BB) - medium stack\n\nWith 8.8 BB, I'm in a critical spot. I should be looking for spots to either:\n- Fold and preserve my stack for better hands\n- Shove all-in with decent hands to maximize fold equity\n\n8-7 offsuit is not a good hand to shove with from the button. It's too weak. Even though I'm on the button, this hand doesn't play well against typical calling ranges.\n\nLet me think about what hands I should be shoving with from the button with 8.8 BB. Typically, I'd want:\n- Any pocket pair\n- Any Ace\n- Any two Broadway cards\n- Suited connectors (maybe)\n- Some Kx and Qx hands\n\n8-7 offsuit is just too weak. I should fold here and wait for a better spot. The fact that I'm on the button doesn't overcome the weakness of this hand with such a short stack.\n\nI don't need to use the memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold based on basic tournament strategy with a short stack and a weak hand.\n\nDecision: FOLD",

It's offsuit, low kicker, and doesn't connect well. Playing this from UTG is extremely marginal.\n\n**Stack considerations**: With only 4.4 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. However, this is an UTG position, meaning 4 players are yet to act behind me. Even with a short stack, I need a decent hand to commit chips.\n\n**Pot odds**: The pot is 48 and I need to call 32, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds. This would require me to win at least 40% of the time to break even. With 3c Th from UTG, my actual equity is likely much lower than this.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB) has been folding a lot preflop\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, BB) has been somewhat passive\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been active with raises and bets\n\nHowever, with my position being UTG, I have to worry about all 4 players behind me, especially the deeper stacked Kimi-K2 in Seat 2 with 461 chips.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 4.4 BB, I need to find spots to get my money in good. This is not that spot. I should wait for a better hand or better position. Folding costs me nothing but the blinds, and I can look for a better opportunity when I'm in later position or have a stronger hand.\n\nDecision: Fold.

Better to preserve my short stack for a better spot where I can be the aggressor.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Kc 7c - King-7 suited. This is a marginal hand, not particularly strong but has some potential with the King and the clubs suit.\n\n2. **Position**: BB (Big Blind) - I'm out of position postflop.\n\n3. **My stack**: 108 chips (3.4 BB) - I'm very short-stacked. This is a critical tournament situation.\n\n4. **Current action**:\n   - Seat 5 posted SB\n   - I posted BB (32 chips)\n   - Seat 3 raised to 80\n   - Seat 5 (the small blind) raised to 128\n\n5. **Amount to call**: 96 chips\n   - I have 108 chips total\n   - If I call, I'd have 12 chips left\n   - This is essentially committing my entire stack\n\n6. **Pot size**: 240 chips\n   - My pot odds: 240:96 = 2.5:1\n   - I need 28.6% equity to call\n\n7. **Opponents**:\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Raised to 80 from middle position with 170 chips (5.3 BB)\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Only has 5 chips left after posting SB, so their \"raise\" to 128 is actually all-in for 5 chips total. They posted SB 16, so they must have had 21 chips (16+5). After posting SB, they have 5 left.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the action. Seat 5 posted SB 16, then later raised to 128. But they only have 5 chips. This means they went all-in for their remaining 5 chips, and the system is showing it as a raise to 128 but they can only actually put in 5 chips.\n\nActually, let me reread: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 5 chips\" and \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 128\". This is contradictory. If they only have 5 chips, they can't raise to 128. \n\nI realize the raise notation is confusing. The 128 likely represents the total amount Seat 5 would need to call, not their actual chip count. Despite showing 5 chips, the system indicates a raise to 128, which suggests an all-in scenario. The key is understanding the actual chip commitment and potential pot odds, which remain 240:96 with 2.5:1 ratio.\n\nWhen I call 96 chips, the pot will expand to 336, and I'll have 12 chips remaining. With Kc7c, my hand is marginal against potential opponent ranges. I estimate my equity is likely insufficient against probable strong hands like high pairs or high cards.\n\nMy short stack of 3.4 BB severely limits my strategic options. I need to carefully consider shoving or folding based on potential opponent actions and my current chip position.\n\nThe situation is complicated by conflicting information about Seat 5's raise. Despite the unclear details, my pot odds are 2.5:1, which suggests I need around 28.6% equity to justify calling. However, against typical 3-bet ranges, my Kc7c likely falls short of this required equity.\n\nWith an M-ratio of 1.4, I'm critically short-stacked and must make a strategic decision quickly. The original raiser's 80-chip bet and the subsequent all-in from the short stack create a complex scenario that requires careful analysis of potential hand ranges and tournament survival.\n\nI need to conserve my limited chips and wait for a more favorable opportunity. K7s is not a strong enough hand to risk tournament elimination, especially against unknown opponent ranges. The potential 2.5:1 pot odds are tempting, but my hand's low equity makes this a clear fold.\n\nI'll preserve my 108 chips and look for a better spot to make a move, likely in an upcoming hand where I can be the initial aggressor.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: Q\u2660 J\u2660 - This is a strong suited broadway hand, especially in position on the button. Good potential for straights, flushes, and strong pairs.\n\n2. **My stack**: 92 chips (2.9 BB) - This is critically short-stacked. I'm in desperate need of chips and should be looking for spots to get all-in.\n\n3. **Position**: BTN - Perfect position, I get to act last postflop.\n\n4. **Current action**: \n   - SB posted 16\n   - BB posted 32\n   - One player folded\n   - I need to call 32 or raise\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**:\n   - **Seat 2 (SB)**: Kimi-K2 with 461 chips (14.4 BB) - Big stack. Looking at their history, they seem to play fairly standard. They fold preflop sometimes (hands 81, 82), call sometimes (hand 80), and bet postflop occasionally. They've shown down hands like 9hJc, JhAc, QhQs, AhJs, 7cKh - reasonable holdings.\n   \n   - **Seat 3 (BB)**: DeepSeek-V3.2 with 85 chips (2.7 BB) - Also short-stacked. More aggressive based on history. They made a big raise to 80 in hand 82, and have shown aggression postflop with bets on river (hand 81) and turn (hand 82). They've shown down hands like 6cAc, KhKs, Ad6s, Jd2s, 9dJc.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 48 and I need to call 32, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds. This is reasonable for QJs.\n\n7. **Tournament situation**: With only 2.9 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Standard play would be to shove here with QJs from the button, especially against two opponents who are both capable of folding.\n\n8. **Decision**: Given my short stack and the strength of QJs on the button, I should raise all-in. This gives me:\n   - Fold equity - both opponents can fold\n   - Good hand equity if called\n   - Maximum pressure with a short stack\n   - The chance to double up or better\n\nThe minimum raise is to 64, but with 92 chips, I should just shove all-in for 92 total.\n\nLet me verify this is the right move by considering if call could be an option. Calling would leave me with only 60 chips postflop, which severely limits my options. With such a short stack, it's better to take control and apply pressure now with a strong hand.\n\nThe all-in raise is the correct tournament play here.",

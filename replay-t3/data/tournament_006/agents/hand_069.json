            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 9d 6h (offsuit, very weak hand)\n- Position: Button (good position)\n- Stack: 228 chips (14.2 BB) - getting short\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- Facing a raise from SB to 32 (2x the big blind)\n- Amount to call: 16\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nLooking at their recent history (20 actions):\n- They've been very tight, folding most hands (hands 56, 57, 58, 60-68 all folds)\n- When they do raise preflop (hands 55, 59), they show aggression postflop\n- In hand 59, they raised preflop to 24, then bet flop (30) and turn (57) - showing strength\n- They seem to be a tight-aggressive player\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 9-6 offsuit is a very weak hand, should be folded in most situations\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is good, but not enough to compensate for hand weakness\n3. **Stack Size**: 14.2 BB is getting short, I need to be selective and look for spots to accumulate chips\n4. **Opponent's Range**: Given their tight nature, their raise from SB likely represents a strong hand (top 15-20% of hands)\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 16 to win 48, getting 3:1 odds. Even with these odds, 9-6 offsuit performs poorly against a strong range\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 14.2 BB, I should be looking for better spots. While I could defend the blind with a stronger hand, 9-6 offsuit is just too weak\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. Even though I'm getting decent pot odds and have position, 9-6 offsuit is simply not a hand I should be defending with, especially against a tight opponent who likely has a strong range. I should preserve my chips for a better opportunity.",

The blinds are 8/16, so I'm essentially in push-or-fold territory.\n\nLooking at the opponents:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB) has been folding a lot preflop (10 consecutive folds according to the data)\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has also been folding frequently\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB) posted the small blind\n\nSince I'm first to act (UTG), I have to consider that there are 4 players left to act after me. With Q4o, this hand is too weak to open-raise, even with a short stack. The pot odds: I need to call 16 chips into a pot of 24, so I'm getting 1.5:1 pot odds. However, with such a weak hand, I'm unlikely to have the best hand even if I hit something on the flop.\n\nGiven my stack size of 3.5 BB, I should be looking for spots to go all-in, but Q4o from UTG is not a good hand to shove. I'm likely to get called by better hands from later positions.\n\nThe tournament consideration: I need to preserve my stack for a better spot. With only 3.5 BB, I need to pick a better hand to go all-in with, preferably from late position or when I'm in the blinds.\n\nDecision: Fold. Wait for a better spot.

I should look for a hand with better equity or a better position to shove.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q4o is too weak to open from UTG with 3.5 BB stack.

So we are in BB, we have already posted 16. The other players folded, only SB (seat1) posted 8 and we have to act. Amount to call is 8 (the SB's 8). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise total to 32). So legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide action with reasoning. Hand is 9T offsuit (9c Ts). In BB with short stack (9.3 BB). The SB is seat1, with 228 chips (about 14.25 BB). Opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking. We have some recall of opponent's raise amounts preflop: they have raised various amounts: 8, 12, 16, 24, 36. So they sometimes raise small (8 = min raise?), but they also raise larger. In this scenario, they just posted 8 (SB) and we have to call or raise. Since they posted 8, they likely just posted the SB, not raise. Actually SB posted 8 (small blind) and hasn't acted yet. So they are not raising, they are just the SB. So we have to decide to call 8 (i.e., just match the SB) or raise.\n\nOur hand 9T is a decent suited? It's offsuit. In short stack situation, 9T offsuit is a marginal hand. In BB vs SB, with 9 BB stack, you could consider a steal raise if you think SB will fold. However, SB is 228 chips (14 BB) and they posted 8. If we raise to 32, that would be 16 more (since we already have 16 posted). Actually raise to total 32 means we add 16 more chips (since we already have 16). So the total pot after raise would be: SB 8, BB 32 (including our 16 posted + 16 additional), plus maybe the call to 8? Wait: The raise to 32 would be total contribution from BB = 32, meaning we add 16 more beyond the 16 we posted. So the total pot would be 8 (SB) + 32 (BB) = 40 chips, plus maybe any other? That's a 2.5x raise relative to pot. That's decent.\n\nGiven our stack 149 chips, we can also go all-in (149) but that's a huge overbet relative to pot; not advisable.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: unknown but we have short stack; we may need to accumulate chips. 9T offsuit is not premium but could be used for steal. However, if SB is tight, they may fold. But we have no info about SB's tendencies except raise amounts preflop (they have raised sometimes). They might be aggressive. However, they are the SB; they haven't yet acted. They could raise, but they already posted 8. In many games, SB can raise to steal. So we need to anticipate if they will raise? Actually the action order: SB posts 8, BB posts 16, then SB acts first preflop. So SB can either check (i.e., just call the BB's 16? Actually they can call the BB's 16 by putting additional 8? Wait: In heads-up BB vs SB, after blinds, SB acts first. Options: they can raise, or they can check (i.e., just call the BB's 16). In many poker rules, after blinds posted, the SB can either raise or check (i.e., just call the BB's blind). So the amount to call for SB is 8 (to match BB's 16). So the SB can check (i.e., call) or raise.\n\nThus our decision is to either call the SB's 8 (i.e., just match the blind, effectively checking) or raise. If we call, the pot will be 8+16=24? Actually we already have 16 posted; we call 8 to match SB, making total pot 24 (8+16). That's the current pot. So calling would be \"checking\" essentially.\n\nGiven 9T offsuit, it's a decent hand to see flop in a short stack? With 9 BB, calling 8 to see flop is okay if we have good implied odds? But we have limited stack, if we miss flop we will be out. Might be better to raise and try to steal.\n\nBut we need to consider that if we raise to 32, SB may call or raise. If they call, pot will be 8+32 = 40. Our stack after raise: 149"

In BB vs SB, with 9 BB stack, you could consider a steal raise if you think SB will fold. However, SB is 228 chips (14 BB) and they posted 8. If we raise to 32, that would be 16 more (since we already have 16 posted). Actually raise to total 32 means we add 16 more chips (since we already have 16). So the total pot after raise would be: SB 8, BB 32 (including our 16 posted + 16 additional), plus maybe the call to 8? Wait: The raise to 32 would be total contribution from BB = 32, meaning we add 16 more beyond the 16 we posted. So the total pot would be 8 (SB) + 32 (BB) = 40 chips, plus maybe any other? That's a 2.5x raise relative to pot. That's decent.\n\nGiven our stack 149 chips, we can also go all-in (149) but that's a huge overbet relative to pot; not advisable.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: unknown but we have short stack; we may need to accumulate chips. 9T offsuit is not premium but could be used for steal. However, if SB is tight, they may fold. But we have no info about SB's tendencies except raise amounts preflop (they have raised sometimes). They might be aggressive. However, they are the SB; they haven't yet acted. They could raise, but they already posted 8. In many games, SB can raise to steal. So we need to anticipate if they will raise? Actually the action order: SB posts 8, BB posts 16, then SB acts first preflop. So SB can either check (i.e., just call the BB's 16? Actually they can call the BB's 16 by putting additional 8? Wait: In heads-up BB vs SB, after blinds, SB acts first. Options: they can raise, or they can check (i.e., just call the BB's 16). In many poker rules, after blinds posted, the SB can either raise or check (i.e., just call the BB's blind). So the amount to call for SB is 8 (to match BB's 16). So the SB can check (i.e., call) or raise.\n\nThus our decision is to either call the SB's 8 (i.e., just match the blind, effectively checking) or raise. If we call, the pot will be 8+16=24? Actually we already have 16 posted; we call 8 to match SB, making total pot 24 (8+16). That's the current pot. So calling would be \"checking\" essentially.\n\nGiven 9T offsuit, it's a decent hand to see flop in a short stack? With 9 BB, calling 8 to see flop is okay if we have good implied odds? But we have limited stack, if we miss flop we will be out. Might be better to raise and try to steal.\n\nBut we need to consider that if we raise to 32, SB may call or raise. If they call, pot will be 8+32 = 40. Our stack after raise: 149",

However, if SB is aggressive and may call, we could be in trouble. But we have 9 BB, we can still call a raise if they raise? Actually we can only raise to 32 minimum. If they re-raise (4-bet), they'd need to raise at least to 64 (minimum raise to 64). That would be a large portion of our stack but still we could call or go all-in. However, it's unlikely.\n\nGiven typical tournament strategy, with 9 BB, you can steal with a wide range. 9T offsuit is decent for that. So raise.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to: 32 (minimum raise).

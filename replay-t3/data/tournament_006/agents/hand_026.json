Not connected, not suited, low kicker.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Good position, but that doesn't help much with this weak hand.\n\n**Stack**: 220 chips (55 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Action**: \n- SB posted 2\n- BB posted 4\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8\n- Seat 5 folded\n- I need to call 8 to see the flop\n\n**Opponent info**: MiniMax-M2 has been very tight preflop, folding 8 out of 10 recent hands. The only time they didn't fold preflop was in hand 19 where they called 2 (likely a limp or small raise). This suggests they're raising with a strong range.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win a pot of 14 (SB 2 + BB 4 + MiniMax-M2 8). That's 14:8 or 1.75:1, which means I need ~36% equity to call profitably.\n\n**Hand equity**: K3o against a tight raising range (likely something like 77+, AJ+, KQ) has terrible equity - probably around 25-30% at best.\n\n**Position advantage**: Even on the button, this hand is very difficult to play postflop. If I hit a K, I'm often dominated by better kickers. If I hit a 3, it's rarely good.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 55 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nGiven:\n1. Very weak hand (K3o)\n2. Facing a raise from a tight player\n3. Bad pot odds for this hand\n4. Tournament - preserve stack for better spots\n\nThe clear decision is to fold.",

I have 208 chips (52 BB).\n\n**Action so far:** \n- Seat 2 posted SB 2, I posted BB 4\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8 (min-raise from 4 to 8)\n- Seat 5 folded, Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 folded\n- Action is on me, amount to call is 4\n\n**My hand:** Ten-high with 6d. This is a very weak hand - T6o is trash. No suitedness, no connectivity, no high card strength.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the BTN, which is good position, but with such a weak hand it's not enough to justify playing.\n\n**Opponent analysis:** Looking at MiniMax-M2's actions:\n- In 10 recorded actions, they've mostly folded preflop (8 times)\n- They called once (hand 19) and bet on the flop\n- They've never raised preflop in the recorded hands\n- This is their first preflop raise that I can see\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 14 chips (2+4+8). I need to call 4 chips, so pot odds are 14:4 or 3.5:1 (22% equity needed). With T6o, my equity against a typical raising range is probably less than 22%.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 52 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to gamble with trash hands.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. Terrible hand (T6o)\n2. Opponent showing unusual aggression (first raise I've seen from them)\n3. Good position but hand too weak to leverage it\n4. Pot odds decent but hand equity likely too low\n5. Better to preserve stack and wait for better spots\n\nThe correct play is to fold. Even though it's only 4 chips to call, I'd be playing a very weak hand out of position post-flop (since they raised from the SB and I'm BB). The hand has almost no potential to improve post-flop.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"T6o is too weak to defend BB against a raise, especially from an opponent showing unusual aggression. Better to preserve stack and wait for better spots with 52 BB.\"\n}",

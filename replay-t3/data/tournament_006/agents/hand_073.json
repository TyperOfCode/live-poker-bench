The table seems to have some active players.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Hand strength: T3 offsuit is trash - bottom 10% of hands\n2. Position: UTG is worst position\n3. Stack size: 13.8 BB is short, but I need to be selective\n4. Tournament situation: Can't afford to bleed chips with weak hands\n\nWith T3 offsuit from UTG, this is a clear fold. Even with a short stack, I need to wait for better spots. This hand has no playability, no suited potential, and ranks in the bottom 10% of starting hands. From early position, I should only be playing premium hands.\n\nThe pot is 24 chips and I need to call 16, which means I'm putting in 2/3 of the pot with a terrible hand. This is -EV in every scenario.\n\nDecision: Fold",

Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has only 2 chips left, so they're essentially all-in with the SB. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is in the BB with 141 chips.\n\nFrom the opponent history, seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 recent hands). They raised once to 32 in hand 69 and called once in hand 71. They seem relatively tight.\n\nI have AK suited, which is a premium hand. I'm on the button, which is a great position. With only 11.5 BB, I'm getting short-stacked and need to accumulate chips. The pot is 24 chips currently (SB 8 + BB 16). The amount to call is 16, but raising is definitely an option.\n\nGiven my short stack and premium hand, I should be raising. A standard raise would be to 40-48 chips (2.5-3x BB). However, with only 184 chips total, I might consider a larger raise or even going all-in to maximize fold equity and avoid playing postflop with a short stack.\n\nLet me think about the stack sizes:\n- I have 184 chips\n- Seat 4 has 2 chips (already all-in effectively)\n- Seat 5 has 141 chips\n\nIf I raise to say 48 chips (3x BB), that leaves me with 136 chips behind. The pot would be 72 chips (24 + 48). That's committing about 26% of my stack preflop. If seat 5 calls or raises, I'll have difficult decisions postflop.\n\nGiven my short stack and the premium hand, a shove might be reasonable. But let me consider: if I shove for 184 chips, that's 11.5 BB. Seat 5 would need to call 168 more (184 - 16 they already have in). They have 141 chips total, so they'd be calling all-in if they call.\n\nActually, wait: seat 5 has 141 chips total. They already have 16 in as BB. So they'd need to call 125 more to match my 184. That's a significant commitment for them.\n\nGiven seat 5's tight tendencies (folding 70% of hands recently), they're likely to fold to a shove unless they have a premium hand. AK is doing well against most of their calling range.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that seat 4 has only 2 chips, so there's a side pot between me and seat 5 if seat 5 calls.\n\nLet me calculate pot odds for seat 5 if I shove:\n- Main pot: 2 (seat 4) + 16 (seat 5 BB) + 184 (my shove) = 202 chips\n- Seat 5 needs to call 125 more (141 total - 16 already in)\n- Pot odds: 202:125 = about 1.62:1, meaning they need ~38% equity to call\n\nMost hands don't have 38% equity against AK. Only pairs TT+ and maybe AQ have decent equity. Given their tight tendencies, they might only call with JJ+, AK.\n\nActually, let me think about a standard raise first. If I raise to 48 (3x BB), and seat 5 calls, the pot would be 104 chips (24 + 48 + 32 from seat 5). I'd have 136 behind. That's a pot-sized bet left for the flop.\n\nWith AK, I'd prefer to take it down preflop or see all 5 cards. Given my stack size, going all-in might be better to avoid tough postflop decisions.\n\nBut wait, I'm on the button with premium hand. I could also consider a smaller raise to induce action from worse hands. However, with seat 5 being tight, they might fold to any raise unless they have a strong hand.\n\nLet me check if seat 5 has shown any tendency to call raises or 3-bet. From the history: they raised once to 32 in hand 69, called once in hand 71. So they do sometimes play back.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: in hand 71, they called a raise preflop. That suggests they might call with medium strength hands.\n\nI think the optimal play is to raise, but not necessarily all-in. A raise to 40-48 chips seems reasonable. If they call, I can evaluate the flop. If they fold, I win the pot. If they shove, I have to call with AK given the pot odds.\n\nActually, with 11.5 BB, a shove is standard with AK. Many tournament"

With Td 8c, I doubt I have that equity against a hand that was raised to 184 chips preflop.\n\nHowever, I should consider that I'm getting such good pot odds that even with a weak hand, it might be mathematically correct to call. Let me think about this differently:\n\n- If I call and win, I go from 2 chips to 384 chips (winning the 208 pot plus getting my 176 back)\n- If I fold, I'm down to 0 chips and out of the tournament\n- Actually, wait - I have 2 chips already in the pot, so if I call 176 more and lose, I'm out\n- If I call 176 more and win, I have 2 + 176 + 208 = 386 chips\n\nBut the key question is: what are my chances of winning with Td 8c against a hand that raised to 184 chips?\n\nA hand that raises to 184 chips (more than 11x the big blind) is likely to be a premium hand like AA, KK, QQ, AK, etc. Against such a range, Td 8c would have very poor equity.\n\nEven with the good pot odds, calling with Td 8c against what is likely a premium hand range is a bad play.

However legal actions only list fold, call. Usually if you are short, you can go all-in as a call for less than amount to call. But maybe the system only allows call if you have enough chips? Might be that you can call all-in for 141, which is less than required, but it's considered call (all-in). Usually allowed.\n\nGiven hand 2h9d is weak, especially out of position, short stack.

            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent data for Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n\n1. **Preflop tendencies**: They fold frequently (hands 59, 60, 63, 64, 68-73), but when they do raise, they tend to raise to 48 chips (hands 62, 66, 67). This current raise of 48 is consistent with their pattern.\n\n2. **Showdown hands**: They've shown down with Qh Qs (hand 66), Ah Js (hand 67), Jh Ac (hand 36), and 9h Jc (hand 30). So they do play strong hands like pocket queens, AJ, but also some weaker hands like J9.\n\n3. **Current situation**: \n   - I have A\u2663 3\u2660 on the button\n   - Stack: 204 chips (12.8 BB)\n   - Blinds: 8/16\n   - Pot: 72 chips\n   - Need to call 32 chips to see flop\n   - Minimum raise to 80\n\n4. **Hand analysis**: \n   - A3o is a marginal hand, especially out of position (even though I'm on BTN, the raiser is in earlier position)\n   - I'm dominated by many AX hands that opponent could have\n   - Only 12.8 BB left - this is a short stack situation\n   - Pot odds: 32 to win 72 = 2.25:1 or about 31% equity needed\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - With 12.8 BB, I'm in the danger zone\n   - I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call raises\n   - A3o is not strong enough to call a raise with this stack depth\n   - If I call 32, I'll have 172 left (10.75 BB) and will be pot-committed on many flops\n\n6. **Opponent's raise size**: 48 chips is 3x the big blind, which is a standard raise size for them. They do this with both strong hands (QQ, AJ) and presumably some weaker hands.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. A3o is too weak to call a raise with a short stack, and I'm not deep enough to speculate. I should preserve my chips for a better spot, preferably to shove all-in as the first raiser rather than calling off 20% of my stack with a marginal hand.",

Ace-rag offsuit is generally a fold to a raise from early position unless we have a very good reason to play.\n\n2. **Position:** We're in cutoff, which is good, but we're facing a raise from seat 2 (who appears to be in MP position based on seat numbers). The short stack in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has only 2 chips and will be forced all-in on the next hand, so they're not a factor.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** Looking at seat 2's actions, they've raised preflop several times recently (hands 62, 66, 67). They raised to 48 (3x) in hand 66 and 67 as well. They showed QQs in hand 66 and AJs in hand 67 when they raised. So they're raising with a range that includes premium pairs and decent suited aces. They're not super tight but also not super loose.\n\n4. **Stack size:** We have 13 BB, which is getting into push/fold territory. However, we're not desperate yet. The raiser has 365 chips (22.8 BB), so they have us covered.\n\n5. **Pot odds:** We need to call 48 to win 120 (72 pot + 48 call). That's 2.5:1 pot odds, or 28.6% equity needed. A6o vs a typical raising range (say 88+, ATs+, AJo+, KQs) has about 35% equity. So mathematically it's a slight call.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** We're not in immediate danger, but we're below average stack. The short stack will be gone soon. We should be looking for good spots to accumulate chips.\n\n7. **Alternatives:** We could consider a 3-bet shove, but with A6o and a player yet to act behind us (seat 5 with 133 chips, seat 1 with 204 chips), that's risky. They might call with better hands.\n\n**Decision:** This is a marginal spot. Given the pot odds and our position, I think it's a fold. A6o doesn't play well postflop, especially out of position relative to the raiser. The raiser has shown some strength with their recent raises. Better to wait for a better spot with our 13 BB stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A6o is too weak to call a 3x raise from MP given our 13 BB stack.

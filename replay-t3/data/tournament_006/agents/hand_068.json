It's a clear fold.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- Preserving your 15.2 BB stack is important\n- This is not a spot to gamble\n- Wait for better hands and/or better position\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 24, need to call 16 = 1.5:1 odds\n- But this is irrelevant with Q5o from UTG - the hand is too weak\n\nThis is a trivial fold.

Calling commits half my stack with a weak hand and terrible position postflop.\n\nThe best play is to shove all-in. Even with 67o, I have fold equity against the blinds, and if called, I have reasonable equity against many hands. Folding is too conservative with such a short stack.\n\nLet me check if there are similar situations in my hand history. I've won hands from button with raises before.

Actually raise amount is 32 total, which is 2x big blind). So we face raise of 32, need to call 16 more (since we already posted 16). Minimum raise to 48 (i.e., raise additional 16). Hand: Th 7s. Not a strong hand. In BB short stack ~10 BB, facing a raise from a player who sometimes raises larger (we saw raises up to 177 chips, which is huge relative to stack). But currently raise is only 32, which is 2 BB. So likely a standard open raise from DeepSeek-V3.2. Our hand Th7s is weak, suited but low. In short stack, we could consider a shove if we think we have fold equity, but 10 BB is borderline for shove with marginal hand. Usually with 10 BB you can shove with a decent range, but Th7s is not great. Could call to see flop? But calling 16 chips adds to pot 56, so pot after call would be 72, effective stack after call is 141. Not great. Raising would be to 48 minimum, which is a 32 raise (total 48). That would be a 3-bet. With 10 BB, a 3-bet is a big move, but we could also go all-in (157). However, raising to 48 would still leave us with 109 behind, still short. Considering opponent's raise size is small, they may be opening wide. Our hand is weak, better to fold. Also we have 9.8 BB, can't afford to play many marginal hands.

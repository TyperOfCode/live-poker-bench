          "reasoning": "9\u26604\u2666 is a very weak hand with low showdown value and poor post\u2011flop potential. In the small blind, we would have to invest another 8 chips to see a flop, and a raise would be too aggressive for such a hand. Folding preserves our stack and avoids playing a marginal hand out of position.",

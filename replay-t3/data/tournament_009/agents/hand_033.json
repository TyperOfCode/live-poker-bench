            "reasoning_content": "  I have Ace-Jack suited (AcJs) on the button. This is a strong hand, especially in position. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: AcJs is a premium hand, definitely strong enough to raise from the button. It's suited and has good straight potential.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position in poker. I'll act last on every street postflop.\n\n3. **Opponent**: There's only one opponent left (Kimi-K2 in the BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They've been fairly passive (lots of checking)\n   - They folded preflop in hands 31 and 32\n   - They made a raise to 12 in hand 30\n   - They called then folded in hand 31\n   - Generally seems to play somewhat tight/passive\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 258 chips (64.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - BB has 147 chips (36.75 BB) - shorter stack\n   - We're playing tournament poker, so stack preservation matters but this is a good spot to accumulate chips\n\n5. **Action**: It's just 2 chips to call (half the big blind since I posted SB), so very cheap. But with a strong hand on the button against one opponent, I should be raising for value and to take control of the hand.\n\n6. **Raise sizing**: Minimum raise is to 8 (which would be 4 more chips). A standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 12 chips. Given opponent's tendency to fold preflop sometimes, I could raise to 12 to try to take it down now, or I could raise smaller to encourage a call.\n\nGiven my strong hand, position, and opponent's passive tendencies, I should raise. I'll go with a standard 3x raise to 12 chips. This builds the pot with a strong hand, puts pressure on the opponent, and gives me control of the hand.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 12,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Raising with premium Ace-Jack suited on the button.

My UTG hands have been mostly weak: JcKs (folded), KdJs (won), QhJc (folded), Kd4s (folded), 4dTc (folded). Only one winning hand out of the 5 shown.\n\nLooking at opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1), their preflop actions show:\n- Mix of folds, calls, and raises\n- Recent hands show they called 10 chips, raised to 12, called 2 chips\n- Showed down 88 (won), AQ (won), 55 (lost)\n- Seems to be an active player who can have strong hands\n\n**Analysis of A2o UTG:**\n- A2o is a very weak Ace-high hand, especially out of position\n- The kicker is extremely weak (2 vs any other Ace)\n- In UTG position, this is generally a fold\n- Even if I hit an Ace, I'll often be dominated\n- The 2 is essentially a blank\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I'm at 73.8 BB, which is a healthy stack\n- No immediate pressure to accumulate chips aggressively\n- Better to wait for stronger hands in good position\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- I'm getting 4:1 pot odds to call (6 chips in pot, 4 to call)\n- But this doesn't justify playing a weak hand out of position\n\n\n- The kicker weakness makes this hand particularly vulnerable\n\nI'll confidently fold, recognizing the hand's inherent weakness and my challenging position. The marginal pot odds don't compensate for the significant strategic disadvantages of playing A2o from under the gun.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We have BTN with 6d Qd (suited queen six). Stack 288, blinds 2/4. SB posted 2, BB posted 4. No other players left (others folded). So we face a BB of 4, and SB already posted 2 (but SB is seat1? Actually seat1 posted SB 2, seat2 BB 4). So we are to act after BB? In typical order, SB acts first preflop, then BB, then BTN. Here SB posted 2 (no action yet?), but the actions list only shows SB post_sb 2, BB post_bb 4, seat4 fold. So no raises yet. So we are to act on BTN, amount to call 4 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise total to 8). Hand is Q6 suited. This is a weak hand. In BTN, we could raise to steal, but Q6 suited is not a strong stealing hand; but still many players fold to raises from BTN. However opponents are Kimi-K2 (seat1 SB) and seat2 BB. Both have short stacks (258 and 147). They may be willing to call with many hands. Our stack is 72 BB, deep. We could consider raising to isolate BB? But Q6 suited is not great for 3-betting. Better to just call and see flop? But calling 4 into a pot of 6 (plus SB 2) gives us pot odds? After calling, pot will be 10 (2+4+4). Actually we call 4, pot becomes 2+4+4 =10. Our chance to improve? Q6 suited has some equity vs random range. But we are out of position after flop (SB first, then BB). Might be better to fold.\n\nGiven typical strategy: Q6s is a marginal hand. In BTN, you could raise to steal if opponents are tight. But we have info: Kimi-K2's raise amounts: they raised 6, 24, 6, 12 etc. They seem to raise moderate amounts preflop, perhaps indicating they open-raise from SB or BB? Actually they are SB (seat1) and BB (seat2). The raises recorded are from seat2 (BB) maybe. Not sure. But they raise often, maybe they are aggressive. So raising may get a re-raise or call.\n\nThus folding seems prudent.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nI'll fold.\n\n",

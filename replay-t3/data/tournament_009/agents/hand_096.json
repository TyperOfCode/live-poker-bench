They've shown weakness when facing aggression (folding on flop in hand 94 after calling preflop, folding on flop in hand 86 after calling preflop).\n\n**Pot:** 64 chips (32 from me, 16 from SB, 16 from SB's call)\n**To call:** 0 (I can check)\n**Minimum raise:** 64 (to 64 total)\n\n**My hand:** 6\u2660 5\u2663 is a weak hand, but in heads-up situation from BB, it has some playability. However, I'm out of position.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 16.9 BB, I'm in the danger zone. I need to be careful with my chips but also look for spots to accumulate. This is a heads-up pot where I can see a free flop.\n\n**Decision:** I should check here. Reasons:\n1. My hand is weak and doesn't warrant a raise\n2. I'm out of position\n3. The opponent is tight and likely has a better hand if I raise\n4. I can see a free flop and evaluate based on board texture\n5. Preserving my stack is important at 16.9 BB\n6. No need to build a big pot with a weak hand out of position\n\nIf I hit a strong draw or two pair+ on the flop, I can consider playing. Otherwise, easy fold to any aggression.",

This is an extremely strong hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB position.\n\n3. **Action so far**: \n   - Preflop: MiniMax-M2 (SB) called 16, I checked in BB\n   - Flop: I bet 32, MiniMax-M2 called 32\n   - Turn: It's now my action\n\n4. **Pot size**: 128 chips\n   - My stack: 509 chips (15.9 BB)\n   - MiniMax-M2 stack: 341 chips\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: From the search results, I can see MiniMax-M2 tends to fold quite often when facing aggression. They've folded to my raises multiple times preflop, and also folded on the flop when I bet. They seem to be a relatively passive player.\n\n6. **Current situation**: The board has 4 clubs (2c, 4c, Tc) and I'm holding 6s. There's a potential flush draw out there. I have the absolute nuts (straight), but I need to extract value.\n\n7. **My options**: I can check or raise. I want to build the pot and extract maximum value from my straight. Since my opponent called on the flop, they likely have some piece of the board - maybe a pair, a draw, or even a weaker straight.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have the nuts (straight)\n- My opponent has shown willingness to call flop bets\n- There's a flush draw that might complete\n- I want to build the pot\n- My opponent tends to be passive and fold to aggression\n\nI should bet for value here. I need to charge any flush draws and get value from any pairs or weaker hands. \n\nLooking at the pot odds and stack sizes, the pot is 128, and I have 509 chips. I should make a substantial bet to build the pot and charge draws.\n\nLet me make a bet around 2/3 pot - about 85-90 chips. This would:\n1. Charge flush draws appropriately\n\n\n2. Get value from weaker hands\n3. Set up a river bet\n4. Potentially get called by hands like top pair, two pair, or a smaller straight\n\nI'll make an 85-chip bet to maximize value and protect my strong hand against potential draws.

Let me look at their tendencies from the data I retrieved:\n\nFrom the opponent actions:\n- They fold a lot preflop (many folds)\n- When they do call, they sometimes fold on later streets (hand 94: called preflop, folded flop)\n- They don't seem to be very aggressive based on the limited aggressive actions shown\n\n**My analysis:**\n1. **My hand is complete garbage** - I have 6-high on a board with multiple cards that could easily make pairs, straights, etc.\n2. **I've been betting as if I have something** - I bet flop and turn, representing strength\n3. **Opponent has called twice** - This suggests they have something, even if it's marginal\n4. **I cannot win at showdown** - My 6-high will never win against any pair or even Ace-high\n5. **Checking is the only sensible option** - I need to see if they'll check back and give me a free showdown, or if they'll bet and I can fold\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I'm short-stacked with 9.2 BB\n- The pot is already large (554 chips)\n- I cannot afford to bluff off more chips with complete air\n- I need to preserve my stack for better spots\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI should check and hope the opponent checks back. If they bet, I must fold. Raising would be suicidal with 6-high - I have no equity and would just be throwing away chips. This is a clear check/fold spot.\n\nThe opponent has shown they can call bets, so they likely have some piece of the board. I need to minimize my losses here.",

It has decent straight and flush potential.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Kimi-K2 Thinking shows mixed patterns - they've raised preflop in some hands (hands 89, 91) but also folded preflop in others (hands 93, 95). They appear to be a somewhat passive player who checks/calls frequently.\n\n**Position & Stack**: Being on the button is excellent, but at 12.2 BB I'm getting short-stacked. This means I need to be careful about committing too many chips.\n\n**Pot Odds**: Getting 3:1 odds (16 to win 48) makes this a good calling spot.\n\n**Decision**: Given my decent hand, good position, excellent pot odds, and opponent's tendency to be passive, I'll call to see the flop. This allows me to potentially win with a continuation bet if I hit, while not overcommitting my short stack.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"King-Ten offsuit is a decent hand with good playability.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: King-Ten offsuit (Kd-Td) on the button - this is a decent hand, especially in position\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is excellent position\n3. **Stack size**: 389 chips (12.2 BB) - I'm a bit short-stacked\n4. **Opponent**: Only facing Kimi-K2 Thinking in the big blind\n5. **Pot**: 48 chips, I need to call 16 to see the flop\n\nLooking at my recent button performance:\n- I've played 5 button hands recently\n- My win rate is about 26% overall, but on the button specifically I've been folding a lot\n- I won one hand with Kd-8d (king-high) where I just called and checked through\n- I've been calling with decent hands like Kd-Jh and folding weaker hands\n\nLooking at Kimi-K2 Thinking's recent behavior:\n- They've been quite active, raising preflop in some hands (hands 89 and 91)\n- They also fold preflop sometimes (hands 93 and 95)\n- They check/call a lot and seem to be a passive player overall\n- In the most recent hand (95), they folded preflop\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have a decent hand (Kd-Td) with good playability\n2. I'm in position\n3. My opponent seems somewhat passive but capable of raising\n4. I'm short-stacked (12.2 BB)\n5. The pot odds are good (16 to win 48 = 3:1)\n\nI think calling is the best play here. If I raise to 64, I'd be putting in about 1/3 of my stack and might get called by better hands. The call gives me a chance to see the flop cheaply and potentially win the pot with a continuation bet if I hit something, or fold if I miss.\n\nThe call seems optimal given my hand strength, position, and the opponent's tendencies.\n",

With only 128 chips remaining after a call, I'm essentially forced into a marginal situation. The large bet size and my shallow stack make continuing challenging, as any further action would likely commit my entire stack.\n\nMy hand strength provides some comfort - top pair with a strong kicker - but the board's disconnected nature means I'm vulnerable to potential draws or stronger hands. The opponent's betting pattern implies significant strength, which further complicates my decision-making process.\n\nGiven the stack constraints and potential risks, calling appears to be the most prudent strategy. The bet size suggests the opponent is confident, but my hand has enough merit to justify seeing the river. While the potential for being outdrawn exists, the current pot odds make continuing worthwhile.\n\nThe key consideration is my stack's vulnerability. With only 128 chips remaining after this call, I'm essentially committed to the hand. Going all-in might seem aggressive, but it could potentially force the opponent to fold, especially if they're not holding a premium hand.\n\nUltimately, the decision hinges on balancing the risk of being outdrawn against the opportunity to potentially win the pot with a strong pair and favorable kicker.\n\nThe board's low, disconnected nature suggests limited straight or flush potential. My pair of tens with a king kicker remains competitive, and the betting action indicates the opponent may be attempting to exploit the situation.\n\nI'll call the bet, preserving my tournament viability while maintaining a strategic position. The 213-chip investment represents a calculated risk that could yield significant returns if the river card is favorable.",

Opponent: Kimi-K2 Thinking in Seat 1\n5. Stack: 128 chips (4.0 BB)\n6. Pot: 554 chips\n7. Current action: Opponent checked on river\n\nLet me assess my hand strength:\n- I have Td Kh\n- Board shows: 2d 4c Tc 3h 8s\n- This gives me: One pair (Tens) - my Td pairs the Tc on board\n- I also have a King kicker\n- No flushes possible (suites are mixed)\n- No straights possible\n\nSo I have top pair with a decent kicker. This is a reasonably strong hand, especially on this board.\n\nNow let me look at the opponent's behavior from the data:\n\nFrom the recall_opponent_actions, I can see:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has been quite active with raises preflop (hands 77, 86, 89, 91)\n- In hand 94 (the most recent one I can see), they bet 32 on the flop and I folded\n- They seem to be a relatively aggressive player who plays hands\n\nThe key observation is that on the river, they checked. This could mean:\n1. They have a weak hand and are checking for pot control\n2. They have a medium strength hand and are trying to induce a bluff\n3. They have a strong hand and are trapping\n4. They have air and are planning to fold to a bet\n\nGiven that this is a tournament and we're getting to the later stages (hand #96), players tend to be more careful with their chips.\n\nMy stack is 128 chips (4.0 BB), so I'm relatively short-stacked. The pot is 554 chips, which is quite large compared to my stack.\n\nFrom my recent hands, I can see I've been playing somewhat conservatively - folding most hands and only winning when I have good cards or when opponents check down.\n\n\nI'll evaluate the pot odds carefully. With the large pot of 554 chips and my 128-chip stack, I'm getting excellent implied odds. The opponent's river check suggests potential weakness, making a bet more attractive. My top pair with a King kicker has reasonable showdown value, and the favorable pot odds push me towards a value bet. The risk of being raised seems minimal given the stack sizes and opponent's recent passive play.\n\nAnalyzing the board reveals limited scary scenarios. Straight possibilities are blocked, flushes are improbable, and only a few combinations could potentially beat my hand. The opponent's betting pattern - checking the turn and river - indicates a likely weak range. Their turn bet of 213 chips before checking suggests they might have a medium-strength hand they're now uncertain about.\n\nI'm positioned to extract maximum value from this situation. A strategic bet could capitalize on their apparent uncertainty, potentially inducing a call or fold depending on their actual hand strength. The board's characteristics and their recent actions create an opportunity for a well-timed, calculated wager.\n\nThe pot odds and stack dynamics strongly favor a value bet. With a sizable pot already established and limited risk of being dominated, this represents an optimal moment to press my advantage and potentially win additional chips.\n\nMy stack is precisely 128 chips, and the minimum raise requirement is 213, which means I can confidently commit my entire stack without hesitation. This all-in move leverages the pot's current size and positions me strategically for the next betting round.\n\nThe scenario presents an opportunity where going all-in could maximize my chip potential and potentially force opponents into difficult decisions. By committing my entire stack, I create pressure and signal confidence in my current hand strength.",

            "reasoning_content": "Now I have a much clearer picture of the situation. Let me analyze the data I've gathered:\n\n**My Recent Button Performance:**\n- Recent BTN hands show I've been folding a lot (68 folds out of 95 hands)\n- Win rate is 26.3%, which is reasonable for tournament poker\n- I just won a hand (hand #88) with 8d Kh, showing I can win pots when I play them\n\n**Kimi-K2 Thinking's River Behavior:**\n- From the data, Kimi-K2 Thinking has checked on the river 7 times out of the observed hands\n- Only once (hand #70) did they bet on the river for 52 chips\n- This suggests they are quite passive on the river, often checking with medium-strength hands\n\n**Current Situation Analysis:**\n- Board: 2d 4c Tc 3h 8s - no flushes, no straights, no pairs on board\n- My hand: Td Kh - I have top pair (Tens) with a King kicker\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking checked on the river after betting 32 on flop and 213 on turn\n- Pot is 554 chips, my stack is 128 chips (4 BB)\n\n**Key Insights:**\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown a pattern of checking river when they don't have a strong hand\n2. They bet aggressively on turn (213 into a smaller pot), suggesting they had something but didn't improve\n3. My top pair with King kicker is likely ahead of their range given their river check\n4. The pot is very large (554) compared to my stack (128), giving me good implied odds if I bet\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n- My hand has showdown value (top pair)\n- Opponent's river check suggests weakness\n- I can potentially get value from worse hands (like smaller pairs, Ace-high, etc.)\n\n\n- With a modest 4 BB stack, I'm considering an aggressive betting strategy to maximize my chip potential\n- The substantial pot size offers an opportunity to make a meaningful impact on my tournament standing\n",

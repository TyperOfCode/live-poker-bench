            "reasoning_content": "  The opponent GPT-OSS-120B has raised to 20 (2.5x BB) from the CO position (Seat 5). Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand:** Ks 9s - Suited King, but a weak kicker. This is a marginal hand, especially from SB.\n\n**My position:** SB - one of the worst positions, I'll be out of position postflop.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- Me: 256 chips (32 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent: 268 chips (33.5 BB) - similar stack size\n- BB (Seat 2): 109 chips (13.6 BB) - short stack\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has been very tight:\n- Raising preflop in hands 25, 31, 36 (amount 12 each time, which is 1.5x BB)\n- Folding most of the time (hands 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40)\n- When they do raise, they seem to give up on later streets (fold on flop in hand 24, fold on turn in hand 25)\n\nThis is a 2.5x raise (20 chips), which is larger than their usual 1.5x raises. This suggests a stronger hand range.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 16 chips to win 52 chips (20 raise + 4 SB + 8 BB + 20 from opponent). That's about 30.7% equity needed.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- K9s is not strong enough to call a raise from SB, especially out of position\n- The opponent appears tight and is raising larger than usual, suggesting strength\n- Being out of position postflop is a major disadvantage\n- I have a healthy stack and don't need to take marginal spots\n- The BB is short-stacked and might shove, creating additional risk\n\n\nI'll fold this hand. The combination of a weak starting hand, poor position, and opponent's tight-aggressive tendencies makes this an easy decision. The risk of facing a potential shove from the short-stacked big blind adds another layer of caution to this marginal situation.",

It's a garbage hand with no significant connectivity or pair potential.\n\n2. **My position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst possible position to play weak hands from, as I have to act first and face pressure from all remaining players.\n\n3. **My stack**: 329 chips (41.1 BB) - This is a decent stack size, not short stacked but not deep either.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking (256 chips)\n   - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (109 chips) \n   - Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 (0 chips, already folded)\n   - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B (288 chips)\n\n5. **Looking at my UTG history**: From the recall data, I can see that in my previous 10 UTG hands, I've folded 9 times and only played once (hand #16 with Kd Js which I won). My UTG win rate is only 17.5% and I've been folding a lot from UTG, which makes sense given the difficulty of the position.\n\n6. **Seat 1 opponent analysis**: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been quite active with preflop raises - in the data I found, they've raised 6 times preflop, with amounts ranging from 4 to 12 chips. They've shown strong hands like pocket 8s, Ace-Queen suited, and pocket 5s at showdown.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to see the flop. The pot would become 20 chips if I call (12 + 8).\n\nThis is clearly a fold situation. 2d 8c is an extremely weak hand from the worst position. Even though my stack is decent, I shouldn't be playing garbage hands from UTG, especially when there's an active raiser (Seat 1) who has been showing strength.\n \nFolding is the only logical move here. With such a weak hand and poor position, continuing would be a strategic mistake. The minimal investment of 8 chips isn't worth the risk of playing from the worst table position.\n",

Both have relatively short stacks, especially BB with 109 chips (~13.6 BB). Our hand K5 offsuit. In BTN, typical play: raise or call? With K5 offsuit, it's marginal. Considering opponent stacks short, we could raise to isolate and maybe steal blinds. SB is 256 chips (~32 BB) also shortish. BB is 109 chips (~13.6 BB) maybe likely to call or go all-in? But our raise size minimum 16 (total). Usually raise to 2.5-3x BB = 20-24. Since we have 36 BB stack, can raise. But K5 off is not strong for 3-bet; but we can open raise standard. However we might consider that both opponents are short, and we want to avoid being called by BB who could go all-in. If we raise to 20, BB might call (8) and see flop with K5, not great. Might be better to just call 8 and see flop cheap? But calling from BTN is unusual; we are out of position after flop (SB and BB act first). So better to raise to try to win blinds. Given K5 suited? It's hearts, so 5h Kh, suited? Yes hearts, so K5 suited. Slightly better. So raise to 20 (total) maybe. Minimum raise is 16, but we can raise more. Choose raise to 20. Reasoning: attempt steal, hand decent suited king, short stacks, want to apply pressure.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise allowed. So output raise.\n\n",

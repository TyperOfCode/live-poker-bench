It's offsuit, unconnected, and low cards. Even from the button position, this is a clear fold against a raise from a tight player.\n\nTournament considerations: While I'm on the button with position, my stack is 266 chips (66.5 BB). This is a healthy stack, and I don't need to take unnecessary risks with a garbage hand. The opponent raised to 12 (3x the big blind), which is a standard raise from a tight player with a strong hand.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 16 (the pot), so 2:1 pot odds. Even with these odds, 3-6 offsuit is just too weak to continue.\n\nThe raise from a tight player in the SB suggests they have a strong hand, likely a premium pair or strong broadway cards. My 3-6 offsuit is dominated by almost their entire range.\n\nDecision: Fold. This is an easy fold preflop with a terrible hand against a tight player's raise.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have AKc in BB, small blind posted 2, big blind posted 4. Opponent in seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB 4? Wait seat1 is SB? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 posted SB 2, seat5 posted BB 4. So opponent is SB? Actually seat1 is SB (post_sb 2). So seat1 is SB with 266 chips, they posted 2. They haven't acted yet? The actions list shows seat5 post_sb 2 (that's us? Wait seat5 is BB, but they posted sb? Might be mis labeling). Actually seat5 is BB but they posted sb 2? Might be a mistake. Anyway we have amount to call 2 (the SB). So opponent in SB likely raised? No they haven't acted; amount to call 2 suggests we need to call the SB's 2 (they posted). So it's our turn after SB posted? Actually order: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, then action proceeds to UTG etc but only two players left: SB and BB. SB already posted, BB posted, now SB acts first preflop. But action list shows only posts, no raises. So SB hasn't acted yet, it's now SB's turn? But amount to call is 2, meaning SB must act, but we are BB. Wait we are BB, we act after SB. So SB's action would be either call (check) or raise. Since amount to call is 2, that is the amount we would need to call if SB raised to 6? Actually the minimum raise is 8 (total). So amount to call is 2 meaning the SB has not raised, they just posted blind. So it's our turn to act, we can check (i.e., just call 0) because we are BB and can check the blind? In NLHE, after blinds, the action starts with player left of BB (SB). Since SB posted blind, they act first; they can check (i.e., just call the blind) or raise. But the action list doesn't show SB's action, so maybe it's our turn because SB checked? Actually if SB checks, the action goes to BB who can check (i.e., just see flop) or raise. The amount to call is 2 (the SB's blind) meaning we need to call 2 to match SB's blind if we want to see flop. So we have the option to call 2, raise to at least 8, or fold (but folding loses 4). So we have AKc, strong hand. We should raise. Consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking raises preflop to 12 often (based on recall). So they are aggressive. But they haven't acted yet; they posted SB 2, could raise. If they raise, they'd likely raise to 12 (3x BB). So we can re-raise (3-bet) to maybe 30? Our stack is 288, we can do a decent 3-bet. Since they are aggressive, we want to isolate. A typical 3-bet size from BB vs SB is 3-4x the raise. If they raise to 12, 3-bet to ~30-36. Minimum raise is 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total). We could raise to 12 to just call? Actually raise to 12 would be a call? No raise to 12 means total bet 12, which is a 3-bet if they raised to 12. But they haven't raised yet. So we are raising to 12 (i.e., 3-bet) as a standard open raise from BB? Usually BB open raise size is 2.5-3x BB (i.e., 10-12). So raise to 12 is fine.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 12. Reasoning: strong AK, isolate aggressive SB, build pot.\n\nReturn JSON.",

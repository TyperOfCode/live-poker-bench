            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** As Jd - Ace of spades, Jack of diamonds. This is a decent starting hand, especially in late position. AJ offsuit is strong but not premium.\n\n**Position:** SB (small blind) - This is terrible position. I'll be first to act post-flop.\n\n**Stack:** 178 chips (89 BB) - Deep stack, plenty of room to maneuver.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Blinds are 1/2 (1 SB, 2 BB)\n- Pot is 9 chips (includes 1 from SB, 2 from BB, and 6 from Seat 5's raise)\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6 (3x BB)\n- I need to call 5 more chips\n- I can raise to minimum 10 or more\n\n**Opponent analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see:\n- Very tight player: folded in 7 out of 10 hands\n- Only raised once before (hand #15) with a 4 chip raise\n- When they did get to showdown (hand #18), they checked preflop, then bet 2 on flop and 6 on turn - showing they can be aggressive when they have something\n\nThis player appears to be very tight, folding most hands. Their raise to 6 chips from late position (CO) suggests they have a strong hand. Given their tight nature, this is likely:\n- Premium pairs: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT\n- Strong broadway hands: AK, AQ, maybe AJ, KQ\n- Possibly medium pairs: 99-77\n\n**My hand consideration:**\nAJ offsuit from SB vs a tight player's raise is marginal at best. I'm dominated by:\n- AA, KK, QQ, JJ (crushing me)\n- AK, AQ (dominating me)\n- Even against TT-77, I'm roughly 44-56 underdog\n\n**Position disadvantage:** Being in SB means I'll act first post-flop, which is a significant disadvantage.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 5 to win 9, so 5:9 or about 1.8:1. This is not great odds for a marginal hand.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 89 BB, I'm deep enough that I don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving my stack for better opportunities is wise.\n\n**Conclusion:** Fold. This is a clear fold. I'm out of position with a marginal hand against a tight player's raise. The player has shown they only raise with strong hands. Even though AJ looks decent, it's a losing proposition here due to position, opponent strength, and tournament considerations.",

That's a similarly weak hand. 65o is a terrible hand to play from UTG - it's unsuited, low cards, no connectivity except for a straight draw possibility. Playing this from early position is generally a losing proposition.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised preflop before. There are 4 players left to act after me (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, and the blinds). I could face raises behind me.\n\nGiven my position (UTG), the weakness of my hand (65o), and the fact that I have 58 BB which is a reasonable stack to preserve, folding is the correct play. Calling 2 chips with this hand from UTG would be a mistake as I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand with a weak hand.\n\nTournament considerations: With 58 BB, I should be patient and wait for better spots. There's no reason to get involved with 65o from UTG.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"65o is too weak to play from UTG.

Could also limp to see flop cheap, but raising can pick up blinds. Usually raise to about 3x BB = 6, but min raise is 4, we could raise to 6 or more. Legal actions only fold, call, raise. Should we raise? Yes, raise to 6 maybe. Need to consider that they could shove if we raise, but they have 178 chips, 89 BB, they'd likely call or shove all-in if raise is big. Raising to 6 is small relative to their stacks, they might call. But we want to isolate and maybe get action. 9-8 suited has good equity vs random hands. So raise.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 6.

This is a decent hand, especially on the button.\n**Position**: BTN (button) - Best position post-flop\n**Stack**: 461 chips (28.8 BB) - Healthy stack\n**Blinds**: 8/16\n**Pot**: 24 chips\n**To call**: 16 chips\n\nOpponents:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 477 chips, in SB - Has been relatively passive, folding preflop often, calling when they enter\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 24 chips, in BB - Very short stack, just 1.5 BB. They raised in hand 74 and were aggressive post-flop\n\nKey observations:\n1. GPT-OSS-120B is extremely short stacked (24 chips = 1.5 BB). They're in the BB and have shown aggression previously (raised to 48 in hand 74, then bet 80 on flop and turn).\n2. MiniMax-M2 in SB has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 72, 73) but called in hand 74.\n3. I'm on the button with a decent hand.\n\nGiven GPT-OSS-120B's short stack, they're likely to shove or make a big move. They only have 24 chips left after posting the BB, so they can't make a normal raise - it would be an all-in.\n\nWith KTo on the button, I should:\n- Consider raising to isolate the short stack\n- The short stack might shove with a wide range\n- MiniMax has been passive and might fold to aggression\n\nSince GPT-OSS-120B only has 24 chips total and they've already put in 16, they have 8 chips left. If I raise, they would likely go all-in for their remaining 8 chips.\n\nLet me think about the math:\n- Pot is currently 24 (8 from SB + 16 from BB)\n- If I call 16, pot becomes 40\n- If I raise to 32 (minimum), and GPT-OSS-120B shoves for 8 more, pot would be 24+32+8 = 64, and I'd have to call 8 more (if MiniMax folds)\n\nActually, let me recalculate: GPT-OSS-120B has 24 chips total. They've posted 16 as BB, so they have 8 chips left. If I raise to 32, they can only call 8 more chips (all-in).\n\nI think raising is the right play here to:\n1. Isolate the short stack\n2. Put pressure on MiniMax who has been passive\n3. Build a pot with a decent hand in position\n\nGiven the stack sizes, a raise to about 40-48 seems appropriate. Let me raise to 48, which matches GPT-OSS-120B's previous raise size in hand 74.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. GPT-OSS-120B has only 8 chips left after posting BB. If I raise to 48:\n- They can only call 8 (all-in)\n- MiniMax would have to call 40 more\n- Pot would be 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 48 (my raise) + 8 (GPT all-in) = 80\n\nActually, I need to be more precise about the stack calculation. GPT-OSS-120B has 24 chips total. They posted 16 as BB, leaving them with 8 chips. So they can only put in 8 more chips maximum.\n\nIf I raise to 48:\n- MiniMax in SB has already put in 8, needs to call 40 more\n- GPT-OSS-120B in BB has put in 16, can only call 8 more (all-in)\n- I would be putting in 48 total\n\nThe pot would be: 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 48 (my raise) = 72, and then GPT-OSS-120B could add 8 more if they choose to call (all-in), making it 80 total.\n\nBut wait, if GPT-OSS-120B has 24 chips and posted 16, they have 8 left. They can call any raise by going all-in for their remaining 8.\n\nLet me think about whether I should just call or raise:\n- If I call 16: Pot is 40, we see flop 3-way, GPT-OSS-120B has 8 left\n- If I raise: I can isolate and build pot\n\nWith KTo on the button, this is definitely a raising hand given the situation. The short stack in BB is likely to go all-in with a wide range, and I'm ahead of their range. The SB has been passive.\n\nI'll raise to 48, which is 3x"

Usually in such scenario, you can go all-in as a call (i.e., call all-in for remaining stack). The tool says if you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in. But legal actions only include fold, call, not raise. So we can call (which will be all-in). So decision: call (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, decent hand but not premium, need to gamble.

          "reasoning_content": "  This is the first hand of the tournament, so I have no prior information about my opponents. Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My hand: 8d Qh (offsuit, middle strength)\n- Position: BTN (Button) - this is excellent position\n- Stack: 200 chips (100 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot: 9 chips\n- Facing a raise to 6 from GPT-OSS-120B in late position (seat 5)\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Q8o is a marginal hand. It's not strong enough to call a raise with typically, especially from early position in a full ring game. However, I'm on the button which gives me position advantage.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is huge. I'll act last post-flop, which gives me information advantage and control over the pot.\n\n3. **Opponent**: I have no history on GPT-OSS-120B. The raise to 6 (3x BB) is a standard opening size.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 6 to win 9, so getting 1.5:1 immediate odds. This is not enough direct odds for Q8o.\n\n5. **Implied odds**: With position and a healthy stack, I have some implied odds if I hit a strong hand. Q8 can make straights (T-9-J-Q-K, 9-T-J-Q, etc.) and two pairs.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: It's early, I have a full stack. I should be somewhat selective but can take some speculative calls in position.\n\n**Decision**: I think this is a fold. Q8o is just too weak to call a raise with, even with position. If I had something like suited connectors or a stronger offsuit hand like QJ or KT, I'd consider calling. But Q8o is dominated by many hands that would raise (AQ, KQ, QJ, QT).\n\nLet me reconsider - maybe I can call given the position advantage? The raise is only 3x, and I'm getting decent implied odds with position. However, I think the standard play here is to fold marginal hands like Q8o to a raise, even on the button. I want to avoid difficult post-flop situations with a weak hand.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully. The raise is to 6, which is 3x the BB. This is a relatively small raise. With position, calling might be acceptable to see a flop. But Q8o is really at the bottom of my calling range here. I think the disciplined play is to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nFinal decision: **FOLD**",

See a flop cheaply and hit a set (which happens ~12% of the time)\n2. Take down the pot preflop with a 3-bet\n3. Play post-flop in position\n\nGiven I'm in CO and it's a 4x raise, I think calling is reasonable to set mine. However, a 3-bet could also be good to isolate and potentially win preflop. \n\nLet me think about sizing if I 3-bet. The raise is to 8, so minimum raise is 14. A standard 3-bet would be around 3x their raise, so 24-28 chips. \n\nI think I'll call here to see a flop and try to hit a set.

The board is Tc 3d Jh. I currently have middle pair. The only overcards are T and J. There's no flush or straight draw on this board. \n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN, which is great position. I get to act last.\n\n3. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B raised preflop to 8 (4x BB), and now bets 6 on the flop. From the recall, I can see they were aggressive in Hand #1. They raised preflop, then bet flop (4 into pot), then bet turn (8). This suggests they like to continuation bet and apply pressure.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 25, I need to call 6. That's 6 to win 25, or about 24% equity needed. With pocket 8s on this board, I likely have decent equity against their range.\n\n5. **Opponent's range**: They raised preflop from what appears to be early position (Seat 5 out of 5 players). Their range could include: overpairs (AA-QQ), AK, AQ, AJ, KQ, maybe some middle pairs like 99-JJ. On this flop (T-3-J), they could have:\n   - Top pair with AJ, KJ, QJ\n   - Overpairs (AA, KK, QQ)\n   - Maybe TT or JJ for a set\n   - Complete air (though less likely given preflop raise)\n\n6. **My equity**: With 88, I beat:\n   - Any bluff\n   - Any 3x hand\n   - Some lower pairs like 77, 66, 55, 44, 22\n   - Lose to: TT, JJ (sets), AJ, KJ, QJ, AA, KK, QQ\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive tendencies and the fact that they only bet 6 into a 25 pot (a small bet), I think calling is reasonable. This could be a continuation bet with a wide range.\n\nHowever, I could also consider raising. A raise here would:\n- Protect my hand against overcards\n- Get value from worse hands like 99, 77, 66\n- Charge draws (though there aren't many draws on this board)\n- Potentially fold out some better hands like AJ that don't want to commit\n\nBut raising also risks getting blown off my hand by a re-raise, and I'm not sure I want to play a big pot with just middle pair.\n\nGiven my stack depth (192 chips, ~96 BB), I have room to maneuver. I think calling is the best play here to keep the pot small and see what develops on the turn, especially given my position advantage.\n\nLet me make a call.",

The board shows:\n- Tc (10 of clubs)\n- 3d (3 of diamonds)\n- Jh (Jack of hearts)\n- 5s (5 of spades)\n\nThis board is relatively dry with no flush draw possible (cards are all different suits except clubs and diamonds/hearts/spades mixed). There are some straight possibilities:\n- A-K-Q would make a straight\n- 9-7-6 would make a straight\n- Q-9 would make a straight\n\nBut my 8s don't connect well with this board. I'm losing to:\n- Any pair of Ts, Js, or higher pairs\n- Any two pair\n- Any set\n- Any straight\n\nThe opponent has been betting consistently. Their pattern from the previous hand shows they bet on every street as well. This could be:\n1. A strong hand (top pair or better)\n2. A continuation betting strategy with a wide range\n3. A draw (though there aren't many obvious draws on this board)\n\nPot odds: \n- Pot is 37 chips\n- Need to call 6 chips\n- Pot odds are 37:6 or about 6.2:1\n\nThis means I need to win about 14% of the time to break even. With pocket 8s on this board, do I have 14% equity?\n\nLet me think about what hands the opponent could have:\n- They raised preflop to 8 (4x BB), which is a strong sizing\n- They bet small on the flop (6 into 19 pot = ~32%)\n- They bet small again on the turn (6 into 31 pot = ~19%)\n\nThe small turn bet could be:\n- A value bet with a strong hand\n- A probe/blocking bet with a marginal hand\n- A bet with a draw (though limited draws exist)\n\nGiven that I have a pocket pair and the opponent has shown consistent aggression, but the board is relatively safe for an 8, I think calling is reasonable. I'm getting good pot odds and my 8s might still be good. The opponent could be betting with hands like:\n- AK, AQ (two overcards)\n- AT, A3, AJ, A5 (top pair)\n- KJ, QJ (top pair)\n- Or complete air\n\nHowever, I should be cautious. If I call the turn and face another bet on the river, I'll have a tough decision. But with these pot odds and my hand having some showdown value, I think calling is the best play.\n\nLet me check if there's any information about how this opponent plays in similar situations from previous hands.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have 8s on a board with T-J-5-3. This is not a great board for 8s. The opponent has been betting all three streets. While the pot odds are good, I'm likely behind here. The opponent's consistent betting pattern suggests they have something.\n\nPossible hands I'm ahead of:\n- AK, AQ (6 outs twice = ~24% equity for them)\n- A9, A8, A7, A6 (some outs)\n- Complete bluffs\n\nPossible hands I'm behind:\n- Any pair T or higher (AT, JT, TT, JJ, etc.)\n- Any two pair\n- Any set\n\nGiven the opponent raised preflop and has bet all three streets, I think they're more likely to have a made hand than complete air. The small bet sizing on turn could be a value bet with a strong hand or a blocking bet.\n\nWith 186 chips left (93 BB), I have a healthy stack. Preserving chips is important. Folding here might be too tight given the pot odds, but calling keeps me in a marginal spot on the river.\n\nI think the best play is to CALL. I'm getting 6.2:1 pot odds, and while I'm likely behind, I only need to be good about 14% of the time. My 8s might be good against some of the opponent's range, and I have position so I can control the pot on the river.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully. The opponent bet 8 preflop (4x BB), then bet 6 on flop (into 19), then 6 on turn (into 31). The decreasing bet sizes relative to pot suggest they might be weakening, or they could be value betting with a medium strength hand.\n\nGiven I have position and decent pot odds, I'll call and evaluate on the river. If a safe card comes and they check, I can"

I'm losing to:\n- Any pair of Ts, Js, or higher pairs\n- Any two pair\n- Any set\n- Any straight\n\nThe opponent has been betting consistently. Their pattern from the previous hand shows they bet on every street as well. This could be:\n1. A strong hand (top pair or better)\n2. A continuation betting strategy with a wide range\n3. A draw (though there aren't many obvious draws on this board)\n\nPot odds: \n- Pot is 37 chips\n- Need to call 6 chips\n- Pot odds are 37:6 or about 6.2:1\n\nThis means I need to win about 14% of the time to break even. With pocket 8s on this board, do I have 14% equity?\n\nLet me think about what hands the opponent could have:\n- They raised preflop to 8 (4x BB), which is a strong sizing\n- They bet small on the flop (6 into 19 pot = ~32%)\n- They bet small again on the turn (6 into 31 pot = ~19%)\n\nThe small turn bet could be:\n- A value bet with a strong hand\n- A probe/blocking bet with a marginal hand\n- A bet with a draw (though limited draws exist)\n\nGiven that I have a pocket pair and the opponent has shown consistent aggression, but the board is relatively safe for an 8, I think calling is reasonable. I'm getting good pot odds and my 8s might still be good. The opponent could be betting with hands like:\n- AK, AQ (two overcards)\n- AT, A3, AJ, A5 (top pair)\n- KJ, QJ (top pair)\n- Or complete air\n\nHowever, I should be cautious. If I call the turn and face another bet on the river, I'll have a tough decision. But with these pot odds and my hand having some showdown value, I think calling is the best play.\n\nLet me check if there's any information about how this opponent plays in similar situations from previous hands.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have 8s on a board with T-J-5-3. This is not a great board for 8s. The opponent has been betting all three streets. While the pot odds are good, I'm likely behind here. The opponent's consistent betting pattern suggests they have something.\n\nPossible hands I'm ahead of:\n- AK, AQ (6 outs twice = ~24% equity for them)\n- A9, A8, A7, A6 (some outs)\n- Complete bluffs\n\nPossible hands I'm behind:\n- Any pair T or higher (AT, JT, TT, JJ, etc.)\n- Any two pair\n- Any set\n\nGiven the opponent raised preflop and has bet all three streets, I think they're more likely to have a made hand than complete air. The small bet sizing on turn could be a value bet with a strong hand or a blocking bet.\n\nWith 186 chips left (93 BB), I have a healthy stack. Preserving chips is important. Folding here might be too tight given the pot odds, but calling keeps me in a marginal spot on the river.\n\nI think the best play is to CALL. I'm getting 6.2:1 pot odds, and while I'm likely behind, I only need to be good about 14% of the time. My 8s might be good against some of the opponent's range, and I have position so I can control the pot on the river.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully. The opponent bet 8 preflop (4x BB), then bet 6 on flop (into 19), then 6 on turn (into 31). The decreasing bet sizes relative to pot suggest they might be weakening, or they could be value betting with a medium strength hand.\n\nGiven I have position and decent pot odds, I'll call and evaluate on the river. If a safe card comes and they check, I can",

My hand: Pocket 8s - not great on this board\n2. Board: T-J-5-3 with no flush draw - I lose to any T, J, or 5, and any overpair\n3. Opponent: Has bet preflop, flop, and turn showing consistent aggression\n4. Pot odds: 37:6 = 6.17:1, so I need ~14% equity to call\n\nThe opponent's betting pattern suggests they have a real hand. They've bet 8 preflop (4x BB), 6 on flop (into 19), and 6 on turn (into 31). The consistent betting likely means they have something like:\n- Top pair (AT, JT, AJ, KJ)\n- Overpair (QQ, KK, AA)\n- Two pair or better\n\nWith 8s, I'm likely behind. However, the pot odds are decent. But I have to consider that if I call turn, I'll face another decision on the river where I might lose more chips.\n\nGiven my stack is healthy at 93 BB, and this spot is marginal at best, I think folding is the correct play. I don't want to invest more chips with a marginal hand when I'm likely behind and could lose more on the river. The opponent's consistent aggression suggests strength.\n\nLet me reconsider though... The pot odds are 6.2:1, which is very good. I only need to win 14% of the time. Even if I'm behind most of the time, could my 8s be good 14% of the time?\n\nActually, I think I'm overthinking this. \n\nI'm facing a small turn bet of 6 into a 31 pot. The odds suggest this could be a blocking bet or a probe bet. With my pocket 8s, I'm getting excellent pot odds to see the river. The risk of losing more chips is manageable given my stack size. I'll make the call and potentially catch a card that improves my hand or gives me more information about my opponent's strength.",

The final board shows two tens (Tc, Th), and I have no flush or straight possibilities. My pocket 8s are not improved by the board. So I have a pair of 8s.\n\n2. **Opponent's possible hands**: The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) raised preflop to 8, then bet on the flop (6), bet on the turn (6), and now checked on the river. The board has paired with tens (two tens on board). This could mean:\n   - They had a strong hand like AJ, KJ, QJ, JT, AT, KT, QT, or even TT\n   - They could have been bluffing or semi-bluffing with a draw\n   - The river check suggests they might not have a strong hand, or they're scared of the paired board\n\n3. **My relative hand strength**: With two tens on board, the best possible hand is:\n   - Four of a kind (TTTT) if someone has TT\n   - Full house (any hand with a ten and another pair, or three of a kind with the ten)\n   - Trips (any hand with a ten)\n   - Two pair (any hand with a ten and another card that pairs the board)\n   \n   My pair of 8s is very weak on this board. Almost any hand with a ten beats me, any pocket pair 9s or better beats me, and any two pair beats me.\n\n4. **Opponent's behavior**: From the recall, I see that GPT-OSS-120B has been aggressive preflop and on the flop and turn, but now checked on the river. This could be:\n   - A trap with a very strong hand\n   - A give-up after missing a draw\n   - A medium-strength hand that's scared of the paired board\n   \n5. **Pot size**: The pot is 43 chips. My stack is 180. I have a healthy stack.\n\n6. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position.\n\n7. **Action**: It's checked to me. I can check or raise. \n\nGiven that my hand is very weak (pair of 8s on a board with two tens), and the opponent has shown aggression throughout but now checks, I should be very cautious. My hand is unlikely to be the best hand here. Checking is the safe play. Raising would be a pure bluff, which is risky given the opponent's preflop and postflop aggression.\n\nLet me think about what hands the opponent could have:\n- If they have a ten, they have trips and beat me easily\n- If they have JJ, they have a full house (Jacks full of tens) \n- If they have AA, KK, QQ, 99, they have a higher pair than me\n- If they have a draw that missed, I might have the best hand\n- If they have a medium pocket pair like 77, 66, 55, 44, 33, 22, I might have the best hand EXCEPT they bet the flop and turn which suggests strength\n\nThe opponent's betting pattern (raise preflop, bet flop, bet turn, check river) suggests they had something but the river check is suspicious. However, with my weak pair of 8s, I shouldn't try to bluff here. The risk is too high.\n\nI should check and see a showdown.",

Let me analyze what I see:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ah 2d (ace of hearts, 2 of diamonds) - This is a weak hand, only an ace with a very weak kicker. Not a good hand to play from any position.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position, but that doesn't compensate for a very weak hand.\n\n3. **My stack**: 182 chips (91 BB) - Healthy stack, no pressure.\n\n4. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6 from late position (seat 5). I need to call 6 to continue.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data:\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been active in early hands, raising preflop (hands 1, 2, 6) and betting postflop\n   - They raised to 6 in hand 1 and 6 (same amount)\n   - They raised to 8 in hand 2 \n   - They folded in hands 4 and 5\n   - So they're capable of raising with a range, but also folding when facing action\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 6 to win a pot of 15 (9 + 6). That's 2.5:1 odds, which isn't great for a speculative hand.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack, I don't need to take marginal spots. A2o is a very weak hand that will often be dominated by better aces.\n\n8. **Position advantage**: Even on the button, A2o is too weak to call a raise. The ace is tempting but the kicker is terrible.\n\nDecision: This is an easy fold. A2o is a trash hand, especially when facing a raise. Even with position, the hand has very poor equity and I'll often be dominated. The opponent's raise suggests strength, and I don't want to invest 6 chips (3% of my stack) on a hand that will miss most flops and be difficult to play postflop.\n\n\nI'll fold this hand immediately.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Context:**\n- Position: UTG (earliest position, worst position)\n- Cards: 9c Qc (Queen-9 suited)\n- Stack: 182 chips (91 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- To call: 2 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Q9s is a marginal hand, especially from UTG. It's not strong enough to open-raise from early position in most situations. While it's suited, the kicker (9) is weak.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll have to act first on all postflop streets with 7 players still to act behind me. This significantly reduces the playability of marginal hands.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I'm deep stacked at 91 BB, so I have room to be selective.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the recall, I can see:\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) has been calling and checking a lot, playing somewhat passively\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has folded most hands\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has been aggressive, making raises and big bets\n\n5. **My Recent Play**: I've been playing quite tight - folded in 4 out of 6 hands, with 1 win and 1 loss.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- Early in tournament (based on stack sizes)\n- From UTG with a marginal hand, the standard play is to fold\n- Calling would put me in a difficult position postflop with a weak hand out of position\n- Raising would be an overplay of this hand from early position\n\n**Decision**: Fold. Q9s is simply not strong enough to play from UTG position. The risk/reward is poor, and I'll be out of position against multiple opponents. This is a clear fold in tournament poker strategy.",

I have J2o in BB, and action is back to me.\n\nFrom the opponent recall, I can see MiniMax-M2 has been very tight - mostly folding preflop. They've only called once before (Hand #4) and then folded on the flop. They're not showing aggression.\n\nThe action is on me in the BB. I have a free option to check since the SB folded and MiniMax-M2 just called. There's 5 chips in the pot (1 from SB, 2 from me as BB, and 2 from MiniMax-M2's call).\n\nMy hand J2o is terrible. It's not connected, not suited, and J2 is one of the worst hands in poker. Even though I have position (I'll act last post-flop), this hand has very little potential.\n\nThe pot is small (5 chips), and I have a big stack (180 chips). I should not invest more chips with this garbage hand. The correct play is to check and see a free flop, or fold if there's a raise (but there's no raise here).\n\nSince MiniMax-M2 just called, they likely have a marginal hand - maybe some suited connectors, small pocket pairs, or broadway cards. But I have no reason to raise with J2o.\n\nThe amount to call is 0, so I can check and see the flop for free. This is the clear best option.\n\nLet me think about any tournament considerations: I'm at 90 BB which is a healthy stack. I don't need to take risks with garbage hands. Checking is free and preserves my stack.\n\nDecision: Check",

The only hand that beats me is 55 (full house), which is very unlikely given the preflop action.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB, which is out of position, but with this monster hand that's fine.\n\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 called preflop from late position (seat 4). Looking at their history, they've been very tight - folding most hands preflop. They only called once before (hand #4) and then folded. This suggests they likely have a decent hand but not premium.\n\n4. **Board**: 5h Js Jh - This is a paired board with trip Jacks. Very dry board with no real draws except backdoor flush/straight draws.\n\n5. **Action**: They called preflop and now it's checked to them on the flop. The pot is 5 chips.\n\n**Decision**: With trip Jacks, I have a monster hand. I should definitely bet for value. I want to get chips in while I'm almost certainly ahead. Since the opponent is tight, I should bet a reasonable size to get value from hands like:\n- Any Jack (though unlikely they have one)\n- Pocket pairs 66-TT\n- 5x hands\n- Random floats\n\nGiven the pot is 5 chips and stacks are deep (180 chips), I should make a solid value bet. A bet of 4-5 chips (80-100% pot) seems appropriate to get value and protect against the unlikely event they have a draw or are waiting for a card.\n\nSince the minimum raise is 2 chips, but I want to bet, I need to raise to a total amount. If I want to bet 4 chips total, I'd raise to 4.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount. The pot is 5 chips. A standard value bet would be 3-4 chips (60-80% pot). Given how strong my hand is and that I want to build the pot, I'll go with 4 chips.",

This is a very strong hand, only losing to pocket 5s (which would make quads) or pocket pairs that make a full house.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n1. My hand: Trip Jacks (Jc in hand + Js Jh on board) - very strong hand\n2. Position: I'm in BB, first to act on flop\n3. My stack: 176 chips (88 BB) - healthy stack\n4. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 - from the recall, they seem tight, folding most preflop hands. They called preflop and now raised on the flop\n5. Pot: 17 chips\n6. Current action: I bet 4, they raised to 8 (min-raise)\n\nThe opponent's raise to 8 is a min-raise. Given their tight nature (folding most hands preflop), they likely have something decent. Possible hands:\n- A pair (maybe 5s for trips, or another pocket pair)\n- A draw (straight or flush draw)\n- A weaker Jack (but I have Jc, so only Jd is possible)\n\nSince I have trip Jacks which is very strong, I should consider raising for value. I need to think about:\n- If they have a draw, I want to charge them\n- If they have a weaker made hand, I want to extract value\n- I need to protect against potential full houses or quads\n\nThe minimum raise is to 12 total (which is 4 more to call). I could also consider a larger raise.\n\nGiven the strength of my hand and the relatively small pot, I should raise for value. A raise to about 20-25 chips seems appropriate to build the pot while still getting calls from weaker hands.\n\nLet me raise to 24 chips total. This is a solid raise that:\n1. Builds the pot with my strong hand\n2. Charges draws appropriately\n3. Gives worse hands a chance to call\n4. Doesn't commit my entire stack yet",

          "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket 2s in the SB. I need to make a decision about what to do.\n\nFirst, let me analyze the situation:\n- Hand: 2c 2s (pocket deuces) - This is a low pocket pair\n- Position: SB (small blind) - This is one of the worst positions\n- Stack: 192 chips (96 BB)\n- Action: Seat 5 raised to 6 (3x the BB)\n- To call: 5 chips\n- Pot: 9 chips\n\nPocket pairs like 2s are speculative hands. They have value because:\n1. They can flop a set (about 11.8% chance or ~1 in 8.5 times)\n2. When they hit a set, they often win big pots\n3. They can sometimes win unimproved against high cards\n\nHowever, there are significant drawbacks:\n1. They're vulnerable to overcards on the flop\n2. From SB, I'll be out of position post-flop\n3. I'll be heads-up against a raiser who has shown aggression\n\nLet me think about what I learned from the opponent's history:\n- GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop 3 times in the past (hands 1, 2, and 6)\n- Raises were 6, 8, and 6 chips\n- This suggests they play relatively aggressively preflop\n\nThe key question is: Do I have the implied odds to call?\n\nTo call: 5 chips\nCurrent pot: 9 chips\nPot odds: 5/9 = 55.5%\n\nFor set mining, I want to see if I can win enough when I hit to justify the call. The rule of thumb is that I need to be able to win at least 10-15x the amount I call when I hit a set.\n\nI need to win approximately: 5 x 12 = 60 chips when I hit\n\nIf I call 5, the pot will be 14 chips. I would need to win about 4.3x the pot size when I hit. \n\nI have 192 chips, which is deep enough. The raiser has 289 chips, also deep. Both players have enough chips to pay me off.\n\nHowever, the problems are:\n1. I'm out of position - this makes it harder to extract value\n2. Low pocket pairs are hard to play out of position\n3. If I don't hit (which is 7 out of 8 times), I'll often have to fold to continuation bets\n\nGiven that I'm in the SB and will be out of position, and pocket 2s are the smallest pair, I think this is a fold. The combination of poor position and low pair strength makes this a marginal spot at best.\n\nIf I were in position or had a bigger pocket pair, I'd be more inclined to call. But from SB with 2s, I think folding is the best play.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 96 BB stacks, set mining can be profitable. But the position disadvantage is significant. I think I'll fold and wait for a better spot.",

It's not a premium hand but has good playability postflop, especially in position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (Button), which is the best position in poker. I'll act last on every street postflop.\n\n3. **Stack**: 192 chips (96 BB) - Healthy stack, plenty of room to play.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - SB posted 1\n   - BB posted 2\n   - Seat 4 folded\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for GPT-OSS-120B:\n   - Hand 6: Made a river bet of 45 (showing aggression)\n   - Hand 7: Preflop fold\n   - Hand 8: Called 4 preflop, then check-folded on turn (showing some weakness)\n   - Hand 9: Preflop fold\n   - Hand 10: Raised to 6 preflop, then bet 8 on flop and 20 on turn (showing aggression)\n\n   So GPT-OSS-120B seems to have a mix of aggressive and passive play. They've shown they can raise preflop and continue with aggression postflop.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 11 (SB+BB+raise). That's about 42% of the pot. With JTs on the button, this is a reasonable call.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 96 BB, I have a healthy stack. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position. JTs has good implied odds.\n\nDecision: I should call here. JTs is a good hand to play in position against a single raiser. I have the advantage of acting last postflop, and the pot odds are reasonable. Folding would be too tight, and raising would be too aggressive with a speculative hand against an opponent who has shown they can play back.",

It's often dominated by AK, AQ, AA, KK, QQ. From UTG, this is typically a fold in tournaments because:\n1. We're likely to face raises from better hands\n2. If we raise, we might get 3-bet\n3. If we call and hit top pair, we could lose a big pot to better kickers\n\n**Opponent Observations from recent hands:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3): Has been aggressive preflop (raised to 6 in hand 8), but also folds to pressure\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Tends to call preflop (called in hand 9), but raised on flop\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Active preflop raiser (raised in hands 10 and 11), but folded to a 3-bet in hand 11\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Folded multiple times, called a raise in hand 10 but folded to turn pressure\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 92 BB\n- No need to take marginal spots from early position\n- Better to preserve chips for better spots\n\n**Position Factor:**\n- UTG is the worst position\n- 4 players still to act behind me\n- High chance someone has a better hand\n\n**Recommendation:**\nFold KQo from UTG. It's not strong enough to raise from this position, and calling would put us in a tough spot post-flop. We want to avoid being dominated by AK, AQ, AA, KK, QQ. \n\n{action: \"fold\", raise_to: null, reasoning: \"KQ offsuit is too weak to play from UTG in a tournament. We're likely dominated by better hands and have 4 players still to act. Preserve chips for better spots.\"}",

It's offsuit and disconnected.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Good position, but that doesn't help much with such a weak hand.\n\n**Stack**: 182 chips (91 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Blinds are 1/2\n- Pot is 9 chips (1 from SB + 2 from BB + 6 from DeepSeek-V3.2's raise)\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 6 from Seat 3 (MP position)\n- I need to call 4 chips to see the flop\n\n**Pot odds**: 4 to win 9 = 2.25:1, which is not great for a hand this weak.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's recent actions:\n- Hand 13: preflop fold\n- Hand 12: preflop fold\n- Hand 11: preflop fold\n- Hand 10: preflop fold\n- Hand 9: preflop fold\n- Hand 8: preflop raise 6, then check flop, bet turn\n- Hand 7: preflop fold\n- Hand 6: river call 45\n\nThis opponent seems relatively tight, folding preflop 7 out of last 9 opportunities. When they do raise (hand 8), they showed aggression postflop with a turn bet.\n\n**Decision**: With 9-2 offsuit, even in position, this is a clear fold. The hand has almost no potential - it can't make a straight without a 4-card gap, and the flush potential is minimal (only one club). Even if I flop a pair, it will be a weak pair with a terrible kicker. \n\nThe opponent's raise suggests they have a real hand, and calling 4 chips with 9-2 offsuit is burning money. \n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I've analyzed my recent hands and I can see a pattern of very tight play. Let me think about this specific situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm UTG (Under The Gun - first to act)\n- Cards: Kd Tc (King-ten offsuit)\n- Stack: 181 chips (90.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- I need to call 2 to see the flop\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength**: KTo is a marginal hand in early position. It's not strong enough to play profitably from UTG in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act on every street with 4 players still to act behind me.\n\n3. **My recent play**: Looking at my hand history, I've been playing extremely tight:\n   - Hand 13: Folded QTs from UTG\n   - Hand 12: Folded KQo from CO facing a raise\n   - Hand 11: Folded TJs from BTN facing a 3-bet\n   - Hand 10: Folded pocket 2s from SB\n   - Hand 8: Folded 69o from UTG\n\n   I've been folding a lot, which suggests I have a tight image but also that I might be playing too passively.\n\n4. **Stack size**: I have a healthy stack of 90.5 BB, so I don't need to take marginal spots.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: In a tournament, preserving chips is important, and playing marginal hands from early position is generally -EV.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. KTo is simply not strong enough to open from UTG. Even though I've been playing very tight and might want to mix it up, this is not the hand to do it with. The risk of running into a dominating hand (any Ace, any King with a better kicker, pocket pairs, etc.) is too high from this position.\n\nI should wait for a better spot, preferably with a stronger hand or better position.",

When they do raise preflop (like now), they likely have a strong hand.\n\n**Position and pot odds:**\n- I'm in BB, which is out of position postflop\n- Pot is 7 chips, I need to call 2 chips\n- Pot odds: 7:2 or 3.5:1\n- This is decent pot odds, but...\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (89.5 BB)\n- J4s is a weak hand, especially out of position\n- Against a tight player who raised, I'm likely dominated\n- Even with suited cards, the reverse implied odds are bad (if I hit a flush, I could lose to a higher flush)\n- The one-gapper straight potential is very unlikely\n\n**Decision:**\nDespite the decent pot odds, this is a clear fold. J4s is too weak to call a raise from a tight player while being out of position. \n\nI'll preserve my chips for better opportunities. The potential flush draw might seem tempting, but the risk of being dominated by a stronger flush makes this an easy decision. Playing out of position with a marginal hand against a tight opponent is a recipe for losing chips.",

AJ offsuit is strong but not premium.\n\n**Position:** SB (small blind) - This is terrible position. I'll be first to act post-flop.\n\n**Stack:** 178 chips (89 BB) - Deep stack, plenty of room to maneuver.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Blinds are 1/2 (1 SB, 2 BB)\n- Pot is 9 chips (includes 1 from SB, 2 from BB, and 6 from Seat 5's raise)\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6 (3x BB)\n- I need to call 5 more chips\n- I can raise to minimum 10 or more\n\n**Opponent analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see:\n- Very tight player: folded in 7 out of 10 hands\n- Only raised once before (hand #15) with a 4 chip raise\n- When they did get to showdown (hand #18), they checked preflop, then bet 2 on flop and 6 on turn - showing they can be aggressive when they have something\n\nThis player appears to be very tight, folding most hands. Their raise to 6 chips from late position (CO) suggests they have a strong hand. Given their tight nature, this is likely:\n- Premium pairs: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT\n- Strong broadway hands: AK, AQ, maybe AJ, KQ\n- Possibly medium pairs: 99-77\n\n**My hand consideration:**\nAJ offsuit from SB vs a tight player's raise is marginal at best. I'm dominated by:\n- AA, KK, QQ, JJ (crushing me)\n- AK, AQ (dominating me)\n- Even against TT-77, I'm roughly 44-56 underdog\n\n**Position disadvantage:** Being in SB means I'll act first post-flop, which is a significant disadvantage.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 5 to win 9, so 5:9 or about 1.8:1. This is not great odds for a marginal hand.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 89 BB, I'm deep enough that I don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving my stack for better opportunities is wise.\n\n**Conclusion:** Fold. This is a clear fold. I'm out of position with a marginal hand against a tight player's raise. The player has shown they only raise with strong hands. Even though AJ looks decent, it's a losing proposition here due to position, opponent strength, and tournament considerations.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent tendencies:\n\nFrom Seat 2 (Kimi-K2, SB):\n- Has been folding frequently in recent hands (hands 17-20 all folded preflop)\n- Only played hand #16 where they called preflop with 5c4h (very weak hand)\n- Seems to be playing tight/passive\n\nFrom Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2, BB):\n- More active, with some preflop raises (hand #17 raised to 6)\n- Has shown willingness to defend BB\n- Has folded some hands too (hands 19-20)\n- Showed down pocket 6s in hand #6\n\nMy situation:\n- Position: Button (best position)\n- Hand: Qs 8h (offsuit, not connected, mediocre hand)\n- Stack: 178 chips (44.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Need to call 4 chips to see flop\n- Pot odds: 6:4 or 1.5:1\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Hand strength: Q8o is marginal. Not suited, not connected. Dominated by many hands.\n2. Position: Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last postflop.\n3. Opponents: SB is tight/passive, folding a lot. BB is more active but has been folding recently.\n4. Stack size: I have a comfortable stack, can afford to see flops.\n5. Tournament: Early/middle stage, no immediate pressure.\n\nGiven I'm on the button with position advantage, and both opponents have shown recent folding tendencies, I could consider a steal raise here. The SB has folded 4 straight hands preflop, and BB has folded 2 straight. They're both playing tight.\n\nHowever, Q8o is quite weak. The question is whether to:\n- Fold: Safe play, avoid trouble with marginal hand\n- Call: See flop in position with mediocre hand\n- Raise: Try to steal blinds given opponents' tightness\n\nWith the SB showing very tight play (4 consecutive folds) and BB also folding recently, a raise could be profitable as a steal attempt. A standard raise would be to about 12-16 chips (3-4x BB).\n\n\nI'll make a strategic steal attempt. A 12-chip raise puts pressure on tight opponents while minimizing risk. The raise gives me a chance to win the pot immediately or play in position if called. It's a calculated move exploiting the current table dynamics.",

Ace-Queen offsuit is a premium hand that I should be playing.\n\n**Position:** UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table since I'll be acting first on all post-flop streets. I need to be more cautious with marginal hands from this position, but AQ is strong enough to play.\n\n**Stack size:** 184 chips (46 BB) - This is a healthy stack, not in danger zone yet.\n\n**Opponents to act:** 3 players behind me (Seat 2, 3, 4) plus the big blind.\n\n**Opponent information from the search:**\n\n1. **DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB):** \n   - Has shown aggression with raises (hands 14, 17)\n   - Has also folded frequently (hands 15, 19, 20, 21)\n   - Called preflop in hand 18\n   - Generally seems to be playing tight-aggressive but with some folds\n   - Stack: 110 chips (27.5 BB) - shorter stack\n\n2. **MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB):**\n   - Generally tight, has folded many hands\n   - Did call preflop once in hand 16 (with KdJs)\n   - Has made some raises (hand 19)\n   - Stack: 195 chips (48.75 BB) - similar to mine\n\n**Key observations:**\n- Both opponents behind me have shown they can fold to aggression\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 has a shorter stack and might be looking for spots\n- From UTG with AQ, I should raise to both build the pot with a strong hand and gain information\n- A standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 12 chips\n\n**Tournament considerations:** \n- I have a healthy stack, so I can afford to play this hand aggressively\n- AQ is strong enough to play from UTG, but I need to be aware I might face 3-bets from strong hands\n- If I get re-raised, I'll need to consider the opponent and their stack size\n\n**Decision:** I should raise. AQ is too strong to just call from UTG. A standard raise to 12 chips (3x BB) seems appropriate. This will:\n1. Build the pot with a strong hand\n2. Potentially isolate against weaker hands\n3. Give me initiative post-flop\n4. Charge draws and weaker hands to see the flop\n\nIf I get 3-bet, I'll need to evaluate based on the opponent and their sizing, but for now, raising is the clear play.",

DeepSeek-V3.2 only has 2 chips left after posting the small blind, so they're essentially shoving with any decent hand. The fact that they've been tight suggests they might have a real hand, but the desperation factor of having only 0.5 BB left means they could be shoving wide.\n\nMy stack: 172 chips (43 BB)\nPot odds: I need to call 98 to win 224 = 2.28:1, which means I need ~30.5% equity\n\nAgainst a typical short stack shove range (any pair, any Ace, any broadway, some suited connectors), AQ has about 55-60% equity.\n\nEven against a tight range like: 77+, ATs+, AJo+, KQs, KQo, I have about 50% equity.\n\nThis is a clear call. I have:\n1. Strong hand (AQ suited)\n2. Good position\n3. Great pot odds\n4. Opponent is desperate with <1 BB\n\nThe only concern is tournament life preservation, but I'm not risking my entire stack (I'd have 74 chips left if I lose), and the pot odds are too good to fold.\n\nI should call.",

That's a strong hand on this board.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is great position.\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 3 is the only opponent left. They have only 2 chips left (0.5 BB) after the preflop action.\n4. **Board**: 8c As 5c - There's a club flush draw possible. I have the Ace of spades, which blocks the nut flush draw but not completely.\n5. **Pot size**: 224 chips, and I only have 74 chips left.\n6. **Preflop action**: Seat 3 made a huge raise to 110 (which is more than their stack - they went all-in effectively), and I called 98. So they have 2 chips left.\n\nGiven that my opponent only has 2 chips left and checked, I should definitely check here. There's no value in betting because:\n- They can't call a meaningful bet (only have 2 chips)\n- If they have any hand, they'll likely bet their last 2 chips\n- Checking gives them a chance to put in their last chips\n- I don't need to protect against anything since they're essentially all-in\n\nI should check and see what they do with their last 2 chips.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The pot is 224 and I have 74. My opponent has 2 chips left. \n\nIf I bet, I could potentially get them to fold and win the 224 pot without showdown. But that would be a terrible outcome because:\n1. I have a very strong hand (top pair, top kicker)\n2. They're extremely short-stacked and likely to put in their last chips with a wide range\n3. The risk of them outdrawing me is minimal compared to the chips already in the pot\n\nChecking is clearly the correct play.

The opponent check-raised preflop (from 12 to 110), which is a huge raise\n2. They checked the flop and turn, which is interesting after such an aggressive preflop raise\n3. They only have 2 chips left (0.5 BB), so they're pot-committed\n4. The pot is already 224 chips, which is HUGE relative to my 74 chip stack\n5. I have top pair, top kicker (Ace with Queen kicker)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies from Recall:**\n- They've been relatively tight, folding preflop in several recent hands\n- They made a big preflop raise in hand #17 (raise to 6)\n- They called small bets in hand #18 but folded on the turn\n- They haven't shown any showdowns, so their aggression level is unclear\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have top pair, top kicker on a board with potential flush draw (3 clubs) and straight draws\n- The opponent's huge preflop raise suggests a strong hand (maybe AK, AQ, AJ, or a premium pair)\n- The fact they checked flop and turn after being so aggressive preflop is suspicious\n- They could have: AK (splitting with me), AQ (chopping), AJ, AT, a set, or a big pocket pair\n- They could also have a flush draw that missed or a straight draw\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 224, I have 74 left\n- If I bet and they call with their last 2 chips, I'm risking 2 to win 226\n- The pot is already so big relative to my stack that I can't fold\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm short-stacked with 18.5 BB\n- The pot is already 3x my stack\n- Folding would leave me with 74 chips in a 224 chip pot that I could have won\n- This is a clear call/getting it in situation with top pair, top kicker\n\n**Decision:**\nThe opponent has checked to me on the turn with only 2 chips left.

This means if I check, they might check again or bet their last 2 chips.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. The amount to call is 0, so checking is free.

With top pair, top kicker and a pot that's already 3x my stack, I cannot fold. The only question is whether to check or bet. But betting isn't an option according to legal actions - only fold or check.\n\nWait, let me re-read. \"Amount to call: 0\" means it's checked to me. \"Legal actions: fold, check\" - this means I cannot bet, only check or fold.\n\nGiven that I have top pair, top kicker and the pot is 224 while I only have 74, folding is absolutely not an option.

The pot is already 224 chips, which is enormous relative to my 74 chip stack (3x my stack)\n2. I have top pair, top kicker (pair of Aces with Queen kicker)\n3. Opponent has only 2 chips left and has checked to me\n4. I cannot bet according to legal actions, only check or fold\n5. Folding would be absolutely terrible - I'd give up a 224 chip pot where I have top pair top kicker\n\n**Opponent's line:**\n- Huge preflop check-raise (110 chips)\n- Check on flop\n- Check on turn\n\nThis is a strange line. The huge preflop raise suggests strength, but then checking twice suggests weakness or a draw that missed.\n\n**Possible opponent hands:**\n- AK: Now has two pair (Aces and Kings) - would beat me\n- AQ: Would chop with me\n- AJ, AT: Would lose to me\n- Pocket pairs (KK, QQ, JJ, TT): QQ would lose, KK would win, others would lose\n- Sets: AA, KK, 88, 55 - would all beat me\n- Flush draw: Might have checked twice with a draw\n- Straight draw: Might have checked twice with a draw\n- Pure bluff: Unlikely given the huge preflop raise\n\n**Key insight:** The opponent's huge preflop raise followed by two checks is very suspicious. This often indicates:\n1. A monster hand that is slowplaying (less likely given the draw-heavy board)\n2. A strong hand that is scared of the turn card (maybe AJ, AT)\n3. A draw that missed\n4. AK that now has two pair\n\n**My decision:** I cannot fold. The pot is too big relative to my stack, and I have top pair top kicker. I must check and go to showdown. \n\nWith only 2 chips remaining, my opponent is essentially all-in. Checking seems like the most prudent move, allowing me to see the showdown without risking additional chips. The massive pot and my strong hand make folding an unwise choice.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with Qs Ad\n- My stack: 74 chips (18.5 BB)\n- Board: 8c As 5c Kh Jh\n- Pot: 224 chips\n- Opponent: DeepSeek-V3.2 with only 2 chips left\n- Action: It's checked to me on the river\n\n**My hand:** I have top pair (Aces) with Q kicker. The board has 4 hearts (8c As 5c Kh Jh) - wait, let me recount: 8c (club), As (spade), 5c (club), Kh (heart), Jh (heart). So there are 2 hearts on the board (Kh and Jh). \n\nActually, let me recount the suits: 8\u2663, A\u2660, 5\u2663, K\u2665, J\u2665. So there are 2 hearts. No flush possible unless someone has two hearts.\n\n**Hand strength:** I have top pair, top kicker (AQ). The board is relatively coordinated with K and J, but I still have top pair. However, there are straight possibilities (Q-10, though I have one Q), and two pair possibilities.\n\n**Opponent analysis:** Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's actions:\n- They post SB (2 chips)\n- Preflop: They raise to 110 (all-in essentially, as they only had 2 chips left after posting SB)\n- I called 98\n- Flop: check\n- Turn: check  \n- River: check\n\nSince they only have 2 chips left and they've checked the river, they likely have a weak hand or are giving up. They made a big preflop raise with a short stack, which could indicate a strong hand or a desperation move.\n\n**Pot odds:** The pot is 224 and I can check for free. No need to risk anything.\n\n**My decision:** I should check back here. My opponent has shown weakness by checking the river with a tiny stack. I have showdown value with top pair, but the board is somewhat scary with K and J. Since I can see a free showdown and my opponent only has 2 chips left (can't bet anyway), checking is the optimal play. Betting would only fold out worse hands and get called by better hands.\n\nLet me verify - they have 2 chips left, so they can't bet. I should check and go to showdown.",

Only raised once in recent 9 hands (hand #19), folded preflop 8 out of 10 times. When they did play (hand #16), they were aggressive post-flop with betting.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B: Somewhat tight but more active. They've folded preflop 7 out of 10 times, but they raised once (hand #20) and played post-flop aggressively in hand #18.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Current pot: 20 chips\n   - Amount to call: 4 chips\n   - Pot odds: 20:4 or 5:1\n\n7. **Analysis**:\n   - I have a trash hand (K3o) that plays very poorly post-flop\n   - MiniMax-M2's raise suggests a strong hand given their tight nature\n   - GPT-OSS-120B's call could be with a wide range from the SB\n   - The pot odds are decent (5:1) but this hand has very poor equity\n   - Even if I hit a King, I'll often be dominated by better kickers\n   - I'm out of position against two players\n   - Given the tight nature of MiniMax-M2, their raising range is likely strong (pairs, strong broadway hands)\n\nThe pot odds are tempting but this hand is just too weak and I'll be out of position. The combination of a tight raiser and being OOP makes this an easy fold. I don't want to invest chips with such a marginal hand that will be difficult to play post-flop.\n\nEven though I'm getting 5:1 on my call, the reverse implied odds (losing more when I'm dominated) and poor playability make this a clear fold.",

Getting 1.8:1 pot odds is marginal but acceptable for this hand given stack depth and opponent tendencies.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively tight, folding many preflop hands (hands 19, 21, 22, 23) and only occasionally raising or calling. In hand 20 they raised to 6, and in hand 24 they called 6 but then folded on the flop.\n\nWith 78s in the SB facing a 3x raise from MP (GPT-OSS-120B), I need to consider:\n1. **Hand strength**: 78s is a suited connector with good postflop potential. It's not strong enough to 3-bet for value, but it has good implied odds if I hit.\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB, which is the worst position. I'll be out of position postflop.\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 292 chips (73 BB), which is a healthy stack. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands.\n4. **Opponent tendency**: GPT-OSS-120B appears to be playing relatively tight, which means when they raise, they likely have a decent hand. However, they also seem to give up easily postflop (folded on flop in hand 24 after calling preflop).\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 10 to win 18, so I'm getting 1.8:1 odds. This is marginal for a speculative hand like 78s.\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 73 BB, I can afford to play some speculative hands, especially against opponents who may fold postflop.\n\nThe key factor here is that I'll be out of position postflop. With a tight opponent who seems to give up on flops, I could potentially float or bluff later streets if they show weakness. However, being OOP makes it harder to realize my equity.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature and tendency to fold postflop, and the fact that I have a decent stack, I think calling is reasonable here. The hand has good implied odds if I hit a strong draw or two pair+ type hand, and I can potentially steal pots on later streets if the opponent shows weakness.\n\nI don't want to 3-bet here because:\n- I'm out of position\n- 78s doesn't have enough raw equity against a tight raising range\n- I don't have fold equity against a tight player who just raised\n\nI could fold, but with 73 BB, I think calling is profitable enough given the opponent's postflop tendencies.\n\nLet me call 10 chips.",

The board shows 6s 6d 9d Qs. \n- I have an open-ended straight draw with 5 or 10 making a straight\n- The board is paired (66) which is concerning\n- There's a possible flush draw on the board (diamonds)\n- I don't have any made hand currently\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nGPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) raised preflop to 12, but then checked the flop. This suggests:\n- They might have missed the flop\n- They could have a medium-strength hand that doesn't want to bet multi-way\n- They could be trapping with a strong hand\n\nFrom the opponent's history:\n- They raise preflop fairly often (hands 18, 20, 24)\n- They continuation bet on the flop in hand 18\n- They've folded to pressure before\n- In hand 24 they called preflop then check-folded on the flop\n\n**Position and Stack Considerations:**\n- I'm in SB, out of position\n- I have a healthy stack of 70.5 BB\n- Pot is 36 chips, which is about 9 BB\n- I can afford to take a shot here\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nIf I check, I see a free card. If I bet, I need to consider if I have fold equity.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have a decent stack. I don't need to take unnecessary risks, but this is a good spot to semi-bluff since both opponents showed weakness by checking.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should bet here as a semi-bluff. I have:\n1. Open-ended straight draw (8 outs roughly)\n2. Both opponents showed weakness by checking\n3. I can represent a strong hand (any 6, pocket pair, or Qx)\n4. Good fold equity against two players who checked\n\nA bet of around 18-24 chips (half pot to 2/3 pot) would be appropriate. This gives me fold equity while not risking too much of my stack.",

Very strong, especially on the button.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is the best position post-flop.\n3. **Opponents**: Both opponents appear tight. The SB has been very tight, folding most hands. The BB has also been tight but will defend their blind occasionally.\n4. **Stack Size**: I have a healthy stack (64.5 BB), so I can afford to play this hand aggressively.\n5. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1), which is fine but raising is better with this hand.\n\nWith KQs on the button against tight opponents, this is a clear raise. I want to:\n- Build the pot with my strong hand\n- Isolate one opponent\n- Take advantage of my position\n- Put pressure on the blinds\n\nGiven the minimum raise is 8 (2x BB), I should raise larger to get value and define the hand. A standard raise would be 3x BB = 12 chips. However, looking at the pattern:\n- Hand 23: SB raised to 12 (3x BB)\n- Hand 24: BB raised to 8 (2x BB when they were not in BB)\n\nI'll make a standard raise of 12 chips (3x BB) to build the pot and get value from my strong hand.",

It's not connected, not suited, and both cards are low. This is a clear fold in almost any situation.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG, which is the worst position (first to act). This means I'll be out of position against everyone else post-flop. From UTG, we need to play very tight.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 66 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack, I should preserve chips and wait for better spots. Playing 7-3 offsuit from UTG is -EV (negative expected value).\n\n5. **Opponent information**: I don't have specific reads on these opponents yet, but even against weak players, 7-3 offsuit from UTG is a fold.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 to win 6 (the pot), which is 1.5:1. But even with good pot odds, this hand is just too weak to play from early position.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. I should wait for a better hand and better position.\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools here - the decision is straightforward based on basic poker fundamentals. 7-3 offsuit from UTG is an automatic fold.\n\nLet me provide the response in the required JSON format.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- My position: SB (Seat 1)\n- My cards: Ts 8s (Ten of spades, Eight of spades) - suited connectors, but not very strong\n- My stack: 260 chips (65 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 30 chips\n- Amount to call: 8 chips\n- I need to call 8 into a pot of 30 (getting 3.75:1 odds)\n\n**Opponent Actions:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 - this is a 3x BB raise\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 12\n- Seat 5 folded\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Kimi-K2 has raised preflop multiple times (hands 7, 11, 12, 23, 27) with amounts varying from 6 to 24. This suggests they're active and potentially raising with a wide range.\n- MiniMax-M2 has only called small amounts (2 chips) in previous hands, suggesting they're more passive/calling station type.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Ts 8s is a marginal hand. It's suited and connected, which gives some potential, but it's easily dominated by higher cards. In SB vs a raise and a call, this is a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, which is the worst position post-flop. I'll be first to act on every street.\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 to win 30, which is 3.75:1 odds. This is decent immediate odds, but the implied odds are questionable with this hand.\n\n4. **Opponent Ranges**: \n   - Kimi-K2 could be raising with a wide range given their history\n   - MiniMax-M2 calling suggests they have something, but their previous calls were for min-raises\n\n5. **Stack Preservation**: With 65 BB, I have a healthy stack. I shouldn't be risking chips with marginal hands out of position.\n\n6. **Multi-way pot**: This will be 3-way action, which decreases my chances of winning with a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Ts 8s is too weak to call a raise from the SB, especially when there's already a caller. I'm out of position with a hand that will often be dominated or miss the flop completely. The 8 chips to call might seem small, but it's 2 BB from the worst position with a marginal hand. I should preserve my stack for better spots.",

The small investment offers great potential upside against this unpredictable player. With position and favorable odds, set mining seems like the optimal strategy here.\n\nThe aggressive nature of my opponent means I could potentially win a substantial pot if I connect with the board. A standard raise might not be the most profitable move, as it could push out weaker hands or lead to a difficult decision if they 3-bet.\n\nMy stack depth and position provide flexibility to see the flop and assess the situation carefully. A set would give me a strong hand that could extract maximum value from this opponent's likely continuation betting tendencies.\n\nI'll complete the small blind and observe the flop, ready to capitalize on any favorable board texture.",

I have a low pocket pair that didn't improve\n2. **Position**: Good (I'm on the button)\n3. **Pot size**: Small (8 chips)\n4. **Stack preservation**: I'm deep-stacked (64 BB), so I don't need to take risks\n5. **Opponent tendency**: Aggressive, but has folded to pressure\n\n**Options**:\n- **Check**: Take a free card, see if I hit a set on the turn. This is safe and preserves my stack.\n- **Bet**: Try to take the pot down now. A small bet might get folds from hands that missed, but the board is scary for my opponent too. However, if I get called or raised, I'm in trouble.\n- **Fold**: Not an option since checking is free\n\n**Recommended action**: Check. This is the safest play. I have a weak hand, and there's no need to risk chips here. I can see a free card and hope to hit a set. If my opponent bets on the turn, I can re-evaluate. Checking also keeps the pot small with my marginal hand.\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to bet here... Actually, given that my opponent checked to me, they likely have a weak hand too. But betting with pocket fives on a K-high board is not a good idea - I'm either getting called by better hands or folding out worse hands. Checking is definitely the best play.",

The board shows K-6-8-3. There's a King on board, which is scary. I have:\n- No pair (5s vs K-6-8-3)\n- No straight draw\n- No flush draw\n- Essentially, I have 2 outs to hit a set (two more 5s in the deck)\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent actions from Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n- They checked on the flop, suggesting weakness\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 17-22, 24, 26)\n- When they do play, they can be aggressive (hand 23, 25, 27, 28)\n- In hand 28, they bet 20 on flop then raised to 80, showing they can be aggressive when they have something\n- They checked to me on the flop\n\n**Current situation:**\n- There's nothing to call (amount to call = 0)\n- I can check or raise\n- The opponent checked twice now (flop and implied check on turn since action is on me)\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I have a very weak hand - just 2 outs\n2. The board has a King which is very likely to be in opponent's range\n3. My opponent has shown they can be aggressive but checked twice\n4. Pot is small (8 chips)\n5. I'm in position (BTN)\n6. Tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, no need to take unnecessary risks\n\n**Pot odds/implied odds:**\nIf I check and see the river for free, I have 2 outs from 46 unknown cards = ~4.3% chance to hit a set. That's not worth betting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI should check here. I have a weak hand with no draw, and I can see the river for free. There's no value in betting as:\n- Better hands will call/raise\n- Worse hands will fold\n- I have no fold equity with such a weak hand\n\nThe opponent's check suggests weakness, but that doesn't mean I should bluff with 5 high. I should preserve my chips and see if I can hit a 5 on the river, or possibly bluff on the river if the opponent shows more weakness.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have pocket 5s with no pair on a K-6-8-3 board - just 2 outs to improve.

The final board is K-9-8-6-3.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 5s. I have a pair of fives.\n\nLet me analyze the action:\n- Preflop: I called 2 (as SB), opponent checked (as BB) - so we saw a cheap flop\n- Flop: Ks 6h 8d - I checked, opponent checked\n- Turn: 3s - I checked, opponent checked\n- River: 9h - I can check or bet\n\nThe opponent has checked to the river twice, showing weakness. Let me look at their history:\n\nFrom the opponent actions I recalled:\n- They fold a lot preflop (hands 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26)\n- When they do play, they can be aggressive (hand 23 raise 12, hand 25 turn raise 72, hand 27 raise 12, hand 28 raise 12 and then raise 80 on flop)\n- They seem to play aggressively when they have something\n\nGiven that they checked the flop (K-6-8) and turn (3), and the river is a 9, they likely don't have:\n- A King (would have bet the flop)\n- A strong hand like two pair or set (would have bet earlier)\n- A straight (would have bet earlier)\n\nThe board is K-9-8-6-3. What hands could beat my 55?\n- Any pair 6s or higher (66, 77, 88, 99, KK)\n\n\n- Any two pair (Kx, 98, 86, etc.)\n- Any trips or better\n\nI'll carefully evaluate the bluffing opportunity.

Q2 offsuit is not a playable hand in most situations, especially from early position. From the button, it's still quite weak.\n\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - This is the best position post-flop, but we're still preflop. Position advantage doesn't compensate for a very weak hand.\n\n**Stack:** 264 chips (66 BB) - This is a healthy stack. I have room to play, but I shouldn't waste chips with weak hands.\n\n**Pot:** 6 chips (1.5 BB)\n\n**Action:** \n- Seat 2 posted SB (2 chips)\n- Seat 4 posted BB (4 chips)  \n- Seat 5 folded\n\nI need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Q2 offsuit is trash. Even from the button, this is a fold in almost all scenarios.\n2. **Pot odds:** I need to call 4 to win 6, so 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not enough to justify playing such a weak hand.\n3. **Opponents:** Seats 2, 4 are still to act after me if I call/raise. Seat 2 has 149 chips (shortish), Seat 4 has 293 chips (deep).\n4. **Tournament considerations:** With 66 BB, I should be selective and wait for better spots. I don't need to gamble with Q2.\n\nI don't need to use memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold. Q2 offsuit is simply not a playable hand, even on the button. The only consideration might be if the blinds were extremely tight and I could steal, but I have no information to suggest that, and it's still too weak.\n\nDecision: **FOLD**",

          "reasoning_content": "  Based on the observation data:\n\n1. **My hand**: 5c 2h - This is a very weak hand (5-2 offsuit), one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n2. **My position**: UTG (Under The Gun) - This is the worst position at the table, acting first preflop. This requires a very tight range.\n\n3. **My stack**: 264 chips (66.0 BB) - I have a healthy stack, no need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Opponent observations**:\n   - **MiniMax-M2** (Seat 4, SB): Has folded to many raises (hands 26, 27, 30), but did call a raise in hand 28 and played aggressively on the flop with T8s. Seems capable of aggression but folds to early position raises.\n   - **GPT-OSS-120B** (Seat 5, BB): Has folded a lot in these hands when facing raises. In hand 26 folded on BTN when facing a raise, in hand 27 folded BB to a raise, in hand 28 folded to a raise, in hand 29 folded SB, in hand 30 folded BTN. Seems quite tight.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack of 66 BB. There's no need to risk chips with a terrible hand from the worst position.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Need to call 4 chips to win 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. But with 5-2 offsuit from UTG, even these odds don't justify playing this hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. From UTG with 5-2 offsuit, this is an automatic fold regardless of opponent tendencies. The hand has no potential, I'm out of position, and I have no need to take risks with my healthy stack.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 7d 7s - Pocket sevens, a medium pocket pair\n**Position:** BB (out of position)\n**Stack:** 260 chips (65 BB)\n**Pot:** 10 chips\n**Action:** MiniMax-M2 called 4 chips from late position (Seat 4), everyone else folded\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nMiniMax-M2 has been relatively tight preflop:\n- Folded in hands 26, 27, 29, 30\n- Called in hand 28 (12 chips - likely defending blinds)\n- Called 2 chips in hand 31 then folded\n\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 is somewhat selective but not extremely tight. When they call preflop from late position, they could have:\n- Broadways (KQ, KJ, QJ, etc.)\n- Suited connectors\n- Medium pairs\n- Some weaker hands\n\n**Hand Strength:** Pocket 7s is a decent hand but vulnerable. Against a late position caller, I'm likely ahead of their range preflop, but post-flop it becomes tricky if overcards hit.\n\n**Position:** I'm out of position in BB, which is a disadvantage. I won't know what they'll do on later streets.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I can check for free since the amount to call is 0.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Checking allows me to see a flop for free with a medium pair\n2. Raising could take down the pot now or build a pot when I'm likely ahead\n3. Raising from OOP with a medium pair can be problematic - if I get called, I'll be in tough spots on overcard boards\n4. My stack is healthy at 65 BB, so I don't need to take unnecessary risks\n\n**Recommendation:** Check. I want to see a cheap flop with my pocket pair. If I hit a set (12% chance), I can potentially win a big pot. If not, I can easily fold to aggression. Raising now would commit more chips out of position with a hand that doesn't play well post-flop against a calling range.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the current hand:\n\nHand #32 - FLOP\nPosition: BB (Seat 1)\nCards: 7d 7s (pocket 7s)\nStack: 260 chips (65.0 BB)\nBoard: 8s 6s 5c\nPot: 10 chips\n\nAction: It's my turn on the flop, and I can check or raise.\n\nLet me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have pocket 7s. The board is 8s 6s 5c. This board is very coordinated and dangerous for pocket 7s:\n   - There are potential straights: 9-7, 7-9, 9-7-4, etc.\n   - There are potential flush draws with 3 spades\n   - My 7s are vulnerable to overcards and straight/flush draws\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB, which is out of position against MiniMax-M2 who is the only other active player.\n\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 is the only opponent remaining. Let me review their tendencies from the search results:\n   - Hand 22: Folded to a 3-bet\n   - Hand 23: Folded to a raise\n   - Hand 24: Raised preflop, bet on flop and got opponent to fold\n   - Hand 25: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 26: Folded to a raise\n   - Hand 27: Folded to a raise\n   - Hand 28: Called preflop, raised flop, then bet turn to get fold\n   - Hand 29: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 30: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 31: Called preflop, then folded to a raise\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems to be a relatively tight player who often folds to aggression. They have shown they can make continuation bets and value bets when they have position.\n\n4. **Current action**: Preflop, MiniMax-M2 just called 4 chips (limp). I checked in BB. Now on the flop, I can check or raise.\n\n5. **Board texture**: This is a wet, coordinated board with straight and flush draws. If MiniMax-M2 has any piece of this board (like a 9, 8, 6, 5, or spade draw), they could have a strong hand or strong draw.\n\n6. **My hand**: Pocket 7s on 8-6-5 board. I have an open-ended straight draw (need a 4 or 9 to make a straight), but I'm also vulnerable. Any 4 or 9 gives me a straight, but a 9 could also give someone a higher straight.\n\n7. **Pot size**: Only 10 chips, so it's a small pot. I should be careful about building a big pot here.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- I have a medium-strength hand on a dangerous board\n- I'm out of position\n- My opponent is tight and likely to fold to aggression if they missed\n- The pot is small, so I should keep it that way\n\nI think checking is the best option here. I want to:\n1. See the turn card for free (or cheap)\n2. Pot control - don't bloat the pot with a marginal hand\n3. Let my opponent potentially bluff if they have nothing\n4. Avoid getting raised with my vulnerable hand\n\nIf I bet and get raised, I'd be in a tough spot. If I bet and they call, I'm out of position on the turn with a vulnerable hand. Checking keeps the pot small and gives me more information.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking pocket 7s on this coordinated 8s-6s-5c board for pot control.

The hand where they were aggressive (hand 28) they were betting and raising, which suggests they can play strong.\n\n**Pot odds**: \nNeed to call 6 to win 22 (16+6) = 27% equity needed. This is a very good price.\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: My 77 is an overpair but on a very dangerous board. It's more like a marginal made hand that needs protection.\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position, which is bad\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 can be aggressive, which is concerning on this board\n\n\n4. **Stack preservation**: I have a healthy 65 BB stack, don't need to take marginal spots\n\nI'll likely fold this hand. The board coordination and opponent's potential aggression make 77 too vulnerable. While pot odds are tempting, the risk of facing continued pressure on later streets outweighs the potential gain. Protecting my stack for better opportunities seems wisest, especially given my out-of-position disadvantage against an unpredictable opponent.\n\nThe bet sizing suggests multiple potential threats: possible straight draws, flush draws, or even a made straight. With only a modest investment of 4 chips preflop, cutting losses now prevents further chip erosion. My stack remains healthy at 65 BB, so preserving chips for more favorable situations makes strategic sense.",

It's suited and has good straight potential.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position in poker. I'll act last on every street postflop.\n\n3. **Opponent**: There's only one opponent left (Kimi-K2 in the BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They've been fairly passive (lots of checking)\n   - They folded preflop in hands 31 and 32\n   - They made a raise to 12 in hand 30\n   - They called then folded in hand 31\n   - Generally seems to play somewhat tight/passive\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 258 chips (64.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - BB has 147 chips (36.75 BB) - shorter stack\n   - We're playing tournament poker, so stack preservation matters but this is a good spot to accumulate chips\n\n5. **Action**: It's just 2 chips to call (half the big blind since I posted SB), so very cheap. But with a strong hand on the button against one opponent, I should be raising for value and to take control of the hand.\n\n6. **Raise sizing**: Minimum raise is to 8 (which would be 4 more chips). A standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 12 chips. Given opponent's tendency to fold preflop sometimes, I could raise to 12 to try to take it down now, or I could raise smaller to encourage a call.\n\nGiven my strong hand, position, and opponent's passive tendencies, I should raise. I'll go with a standard 3x raise to 12 chips. This builds the pot with a strong hand, puts pressure on the opponent, and gives me control of the hand.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 12,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Raising with premium Ace-Jack suited on the button.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n**My Hand:** Q\u2660 A\u2660 (Ace-Queen suited spades)\n**Position:** Button (BTN) - excellent position\n**Stack:** 264 chips (66 BB) - healthy stack\n**Pot:** 6 chips (2 from SB, 4 from BB)\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 145 chips\n- Seat 4 (BB): MiniMax-M2 with 291 chips\n\n**Actions so far:**\n- SB posted 2\n- BB posted 4\n- Seat 5 folded\n\n**Amount to call:** 4 chips (to match the BB)\n**Minimum raise:** 8 chips (2x the BB)\n\nLet me analyze the opponent tendencies based on the search results:\n\n**Kimi-K2 (SB, 145 chips):**\n- Hand 28: Raised to 12 (3x BB), bet 20 on flop, got raised and folded\n- Hand 31: Called 4, folded to a raise\n- Hand 25: Called 8 preflop, then check-folded on turn after facing aggression\n- Hand 23: Raised to 12, won the hand\n- Hand 16: Called 1 preflop, called flop bet, folded on turn\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (BB, 291 chips):**\n- Hand 28: Called 12 preflop, raised flop to 40, called 80 on flop, bet 107 on turn when opponent checked\n- Hand 32: Called 4 preflop, bet 6 on flop\n- Hand 24: Raised to 8 preflop, bet 4 on flop\n- Hand 31: Called 2 preflop, folded to raise\n- Hand 30: Folded to raise\n- Hand 26: Folded to raise\n- Hand 25: Folded preflop\n\n**Key observations:**\n\n1. **Kimi-K2** seems somewhat aggressive but can fold when facing pressure. They've made several raises but also folded when facing aggression.\n\n2. **MiniMax-M2** appears to be the most aggressive player at the table. They frequently raise preflop and continue aggression post-flop. They have the biggest stack (291 chips).\n\n3. **My hand** (AQs) is a premium hand, especially on the button. This is a clear raising hand.\n\n4. **Position:** I'm on the button, which is the best position in poker. I get to act last post-flop.\n\n5. **Stack sizes:** I have 264 chips (66 BB), which is a healthy stack. I can afford to play this hand aggressively.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** With blinds at 2/4 and my stack at 66 BB, I'm in a good spot. I should be looking to accumulate chips with premium hands.\n\n**Decision:** With AQs on the button, I should definitely raise. The question is how much.\n\nGiven:\n- MiniMax-M2 is aggressive and might call/3-bet\n- Kimi-K2 has a shorter stack (145 chips = 36 BB)\n- I want to build the pot with my premium hand\n- Standard raise size is 3x BB = 12 chips\n\nA raise to 12 chips (3x BB) is standard and appropriate here. It:\n1. Builds the pot with my strong hand\n2. Gives me control of the hand\n3. Puts pressure on the blinds\n4. Is a size that both opponents can call with weaker hands\n\nI should not just call (limp) because:\n- I'm giving up value with a premium hand\n- I'm letting the blinds see a cheap flop\n- I'm not taking advantage of my position\n\nI should not overbet because:\n- I want to keep worse hands in\n- A standard sizing is optimal\n\n**Final decision:** Raise to 12 chips (3x the big blind).",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 2h Ks (offsuit)\n- Position: Button (BTN) - good position\n- Stack: 264 chips (66 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- Action: I posted SB (2), BB posted 4, two players folded\n- Amount to call: 2 (to complete from SB to BB)\n- Minimum raise: 8\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent's actions (Kimi-K2 in seat 2), I can see:\n- They fold frequently preflop (hands 26, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36)\n- When they do play, they sometimes raise (hands 27, 28, 30)\n- They made a big raise of 72 on the turn in hand 25\n- In hand 28, they showed aggression with a bet of 20 and raise to 80 on flop, but then checked and folded on turn\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- K2o is a weak hand, especially offsuit\n- King is decent but 2 kicker is very weak\n- From SB position (effectively), this is a fold in most situations\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm on the Button but posted SB, so I'll act first postflop\n- This is not ideal - I'd rather have position throughout the hand\n- However, since it's heads-up against BB, position matters less\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Need to call 2 to win 6 (pot odds 3:1)\n- This is attractive pot odds, but with K2o, even these odds don't justify calling\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 66 BB\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Better to preserve chips for better opportunities\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. K2o is a trash hand, and even though I'm getting decent pot odds, the hand has very poor equity against any random hand the BB might have. The opponent seems to fold a lot preflop but can be aggressive when they play, so I don't want to get involved with such a weak hand. I should fold and move on.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand and the information I've gathered.\n\n## Current Situation\n- **My hand**: Kc 5h (King of clubs, 5 of hearts)\n- **My position**: BTN (Button) - great position\n- **My stack**: 264 chips (66 BB) - very healthy\n- **Blinds**: 2/4\n- **To call**: 4 chips\n- **Pot**: 6 chips\n\n## Opponents\n- **Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**: SB, 145 chips, posted 2\n- **Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)**: BB, 285 chips, posted 4\n- **Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)**: Folded\n\n## Hand Analysis\nK5o is a weak hand. It's not suited, the 5 kicker is very weak, and King-high hands can be problematic. However, I'm on the Button which is the best position in poker.\n\n## Opponent Tendencies (from observations)\nI found some information about MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):\n- Hand 28: Called a raise preflop, then made aggressive raises on flop and turn\n- Hand 29: Folded as SB with pocket 5s\n- Hand 30: Folded BTN after a raise\n- Hand 31: Folded after a raise\n- Hand 32: Called from CO, bet on flop\n- Hand 33: Folded SB\n- Hand 34: Folded BB to a raise\n- Hand 35: Folded UTG\n- Hand 36: Folded CO\n- Hand 37: Folded UTG\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 seems to fold quite often preflop, especially to raises. When they do enter pots, they can be aggressive post-flop.\n\nFor Seat 2 (Kimi-K2), I don't have direct observations, but they seem active.\n\n## Tournament Considerations\n- I have a very healthy stack (66 BB)\n- Blinds are relatively low at 2/4\n- I can afford to be selective\n- However, being on the Button gives me great position\n\n## Decision\nK5o is a marginal hand, but in position on the Button, it might be worth a steal attempt. However, I need to consider:\n\n\nI'll carefully evaluate the steal opportunity. The Button position offers strategic advantage, but the hand's weakness demands caution. Stealing could work given the opponents' tendencies, yet the risk of playing a weak hand out of position post-flop remains significant. My large stack provides flexibility, but maintaining chip discipline is crucial. The preflop dynamics suggest a potential opportunity to apply pressure, especially with one opponent already folding.\n\nThe optimal move appears to be a straightforward fold. Despite positional advantage, K5o's fundamental weakness makes it an unattractive stealing candidate. Preserving my strong stack for more promising situations seems the wisest strategic choice.",

While it has some potential (nut flush draw, wheel straight potential), it's very weak in terms of made hand strength.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (first to act) - This is the worst position. I have 5 players still to act behind me. From UTG, we should play very tight.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 264 chips (66 BB) - This is a decent stack, not desperate yet.\n\n4. **Opponents**: Looking at the opponent actions I recalled:\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 with 143 chips): Has shown folding tendencies, but also some calls and raises\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2 with 291 chips): Has folded a lot preflop, but also called and bet postflop\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B with 290 chips): Has made some preflop raises (12 chips)\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 66 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n6. **Hand strength from UTG**: A2s is typically a fold from early position. It's dominated by many better aces (AK, AQ, AJ, AT, A9, etc.), and even when we hit an ace, we're often behind. The flush potential is nice but we need to hit the flush to have a strong hand.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 6. That's 1.5:1 odds, which isn't particularly compelling for a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold from UTG with A2s. The hand is too weak to open from early position, and calling doesn't make sense either since we'd be playing out of position with a marginal hand. We should wait for better spots.",

Seems to be selective with raises.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Very tight, folds most hands. Only called in hand 38 when checked to, and bet small on flop.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 8-5 offsuit is a trash hand. Very low chance of making a strong hand.\n2. **Position:** I'll be out of position postflop against two players.\n3. **Pot odds:** I need to call 8 to win 30, which is 3.75:1 pot odds. This might seem okay, but with this hand, it's not enough.\n4. **Implied odds:** Very low. Even if I hit something like two pair, I'm likely dominated by better hands.\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With a healthy 65 BB stack, I don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving my stack for better opportunities is key.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. I have a terrible hand, will be out of position, and there are already two players showing strength. The pot odds don't justify calling with such a weak hand. I should wait for a better spot.\n\nEven though I need to call only 8 chips, it's not worth investing in this hand with 8-5 offsuit from the SB against a raise and a call.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent GPT-OSS-120B has raised to 20 (2.5x BB) from the CO position (Seat 5). Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand:** Ks 9s - Suited King, but a weak kicker. This is a marginal hand, especially from SB.\n\n**My position:** SB - one of the worst positions, I'll be out of position postflop.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- Me: 256 chips (32 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent: 268 chips (33.5 BB) - similar stack size\n- BB (Seat 2): 109 chips (13.6 BB) - short stack\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has been very tight:\n- Raising preflop in hands 25, 31, 36 (amount 12 each time, which is 1.5x BB)\n- Folding most of the time (hands 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40)\n- When they do raise, they seem to give up on later streets (fold on flop in hand 24, fold on turn in hand 25)\n\nThis is a 2.5x raise (20 chips), which is larger than their usual 1.5x raises. This suggests a stronger hand range.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 16 chips to win 52 chips (20 raise + 4 SB + 8 BB + 20 from opponent). That's about 30.7% equity needed.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- K9s is not strong enough to call a raise from SB, especially out of position\n- The opponent appears tight and is raising larger than usual, suggesting strength\n- Being out of position postflop is a major disadvantage\n- I have a healthy stack and don't need to take marginal spots\n- The BB is short-stacked and might shove, creating additional risk\n\n\nI'll fold this hand. The combination of a weak starting hand, poor position, and opponent's tight-aggressive tendencies makes this an easy decision. The risk of facing a potential shove from the short-stacked big blind adds another layer of caution to this marginal situation.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket Kings (Ks Kc) on the Button, which is the second-best starting hand in Texas Hold'em. I'm in a great position (BTN) with a strong stack of 32 BB. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket Kings is a premium hand, only behind pocket Aces. I should definitely play this hand aggressively.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, the best position post-flop. This gives me position advantage throughout the hand.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 256 chips = 32 BB. This is a healthy stack. The small blind has 105 chips (13 BB) and the big blind has 321 chips (40 BB). I'm in good shape.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: Let me recall what I found about MiniMax-M2 (the BB):\n   - Hand #32: Called preflop with 77, then bet on flop\n   - Hand #33: Folded SB\n   - Hand #34: Folded BB to a raise\n   - Hand #38: Checked BB, then bet on flop\n   - Hand #40: Called a raise with 8c5h (very loose call), then bet and called on flop and turn\n   \n   MiniMax-M2 seems to play somewhat loose, calling raises with marginal hands and being aggressive post-flop. They've shown they can fold to aggression too.\n\n5. **Current Action**: Only the BB is left to act after me. The SB has folded, and I'm facing a call of 8 chips.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 32 BB, I have room to play, but I shouldn't be reckless. I want to build the pot with my premium hand while I have the advantage.\n\n**Decision**: I should raise. Pocket Kings plays best against fewer opponents, and raising will:\n- Build the pot when I likely have the best hand\n- Get value from worse hands\n- Potentially isolate against one opponent\n- Charge draws to see the flop\n\nGiven the opponent is in the BB and has shown they can call raises with marginal hands, I should make a solid raise. The minimum raise is 16, but I should raise more to:\n1. Build the pot\n2. Define my hand strength\n3. Make it expensive for speculative hands\n\nA standard raise would be 3x the big blind (24 chips), which is 3 BB. This is a good size - it's not too big that it only gets called by better hands, but it's big enough to get value and charge drawing hands.\n\nLet me raise to 24 chips.",

Wait, let me recalculate: They have 4 chips total, posted 4 as SB, so they have 0 left, but they raised to 105. This doesn't make sense mathematically. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, looking at the data: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 4 chips\" and they \"post_sb 4\" and then \"raise 105\". This suggests they had at least 109 chips (4 for SB + 105 for raise). The stack display might be after posting or there's an error. Regardless, they're making a significant raise.\n\n2. **My hand**: KK is extremely strong. I'm only behind AA.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 81 to win a pot that will be 137 + 81 = 218. That's about 2.7:1 odds.\n\n4. **Tournament situation**: I'm in decent shape with 29 BB. This is a big pot that could significantly boost my stack.\n\n5. **Opponent's range**: Given their aggression and the size of the raise (105 into a pot of 24), they could have:\n   - Strong hands: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ\n   - Sometimes bluffs or weaker hands given their aggressive history\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\n\nFolding is out of the question with KK here. The question is call or raise.\n\n**Calling (81 chips):**\n- Pros: See the flop, keep the pot smaller if they have AA\n- Cons: Give them a chance to see 3 cards and potentially outdraw me\n\n**Raising:**\n- Minimum raise to 186 (which is 81 more than the call)\n- I could also go all-in for 232 total\n- This puts maximum pressure on them\n\nGiven that:\n- I have a premium hand (KK)\n- Opponent has shown aggression (could be wide range)\n- I'm in position\n- Tournament poker rewards aggression with strong hands\n- I want to maximize value and protect my hand\n\nThe best play is to **reraise (4-bet)**. Given my stack size and the opponent's aggressive action, I should make a significant raise. Since the minimum raise is to 186, and I have 232, I could either:\n- Raise to 186 (leaving me with 46 chips)\n- Go all-in for 232\n\nGoing all-in is cleaner and puts maximum pressure. It also ensures I realize my full equity if they call with worse.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider the opponent's stack. If they only have 4 chips shown, and they raised to 105, this is confusing. Let me assume they have more chips than displayed, or the display is post-action.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 4 chips\" but they posted SB of 4 and then raised to 105. This suggests the stack info might be outdated or there's an error. The key is they made a raise of 105.\n\nGiven the confusion about their stack, but seeing they can raise to 105, I'll assume they have at least that many chips. My all-in of 232 would be a significant overbet.\n\nLet me go with a strong raise to 186 (the minimum raise) which shows strength while not overcommitting if I'm somehow beat. Actually, wait - the minimum raise is 186 TOTAL, which means I need to put in 186 chips. Since there's 137 in the pot and I need to call 81, a raise to 186 means I'm raising by 105 (186 - 81 = 105 more than calling).\n\nActually, let me recalculate: The raise amount is the TOTAL amount I would put in. So:\n- Pot: 137\n- To call: 81\n- Minimum raise: 186 (meaning I put in "

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I have pocket Kings (Ks Kc) - second best starting hand\n- Position: Button (good position)\n- My stack: 232 chips (29 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 137 chips\n- Amount to call: 81 chips\n- Minimum raise to: 186 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n1. SB posts 4\n2. BB posts 8\n3. I (BTN) raise to 24\n4. SB raises to 105 (this is a 3-bet)\n5. BB folds\n6. Action back to me\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) is the SB who made a significant 3-bet to 105\n- They started with 4 chips shown, which is confusing since they raised to 105\n- This could be a display error or they have more chips\n- Their action: 3-bet from SB position after my BTN raise, which typically indicates strength\n\n**Decision Making:**\n\nWith pocket Kings in this spot:\n1. **Folding**: Absolutely not an option with KK after only facing one raise\n2. **Calling (81)**: \n   - Pros: See flop, keep pot smaller if they have AA\n   - Cons: Give them chance to outdraw, miss value\n3. **Raising**: \n   - Minimum raise is to 186 total (105 more than calling)\n   - I could also go all-in for 232\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nI have a premium hand and should play it aggressively. Given the opponent's 3-bet from SB, they likely have a strong range (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ). \n\nWith KK, I want to:\n- Get value from worse hands (QQ, JJ, AK, AQ)\n- Protect against hands that might outdraw me (AK, AQ)\n- Build a big pot with a strong hand\n\nThe best play is to **reraise (4-bet)**. Since my options are fold, call, or raise, I should raise. Given my stack size and the pot size, I could either raise to the minimum (186) or go all-in (232).\n\nGoing all-in for 232 makes sense because:\n- It maximizes pressure\n- It ensures I realize my equity\n- With 29 BB, this is a standard stack-off spot with KK\n- The opponent's 3-bet size suggests they have a hand that can call\n\nHowever, a raise to 186 is also reasonable as it shows strength while leaving some flexibility. But given tournament dynamics and the strength of KK, I think going all-in is better.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the opponent's stack. The display shows \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 4 chips\" but they raised to 105. This is mathematically impossible unless the display is showing chips AFTER posting the SB or there's an error. Let me assume they have enough chips to make that raise.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll make a standard strong play: Go all-in with KK here.",

No suitedness, no connectivity, low cards.\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB, which is out of position postflop\n3. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called from what appears to be early position (based on seating)\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) completed from SB\n4. **Opponent tendencies from search results**:\n   - MiniMax-M2 has been fairly tight/passive based on the hands shown\n   - They've folded to raises multiple times\n   - In hand 40, they called a raise then bet flop and turn, showing aggression when they have something\n   - In hand 38, they bet on flop after checking preflop\n   - Generally seems to play straightforward\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- With 6-3 offsuit, I have very little equity against any reasonable range\n- I'm out of position postflop\n- The pot is small (24 chips)\n- MiniMax-M2 called from early position, suggesting they have something\n- There's no need to inflate the pot with such a weak hand\n- Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to see a free flop\n- Raising would be a pure bluff that would likely get called by Seat 4 given they voluntarily entered the pot\n- Folding is not an option since I can check for free\n\n**Conclusion**: The best play is to check and see a free flop. There's no value in raising with 6-3 offsuit, and since I can check for free, I should do so. If the flop hits me in some miraculous way (like 6-6-3 or a straight draw), I can proceed cautiously. Otherwise, I'll be ready to fold to any aggression.\n\nThe search results confirm MiniMax-M2 is capable of calling raises and playing postflop, so a bluff raise would be ill-advised. Checking is clearly the optimal play here.",

Even with my weak kicker, I likely have enough equity against their range to call one street. Folding would be too tight given these odds and opponent's weak betting pattern.\"\n}\n```",
          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**Hand details:**\n- My hand: 6s 3c (bottom pair)\n- Board: 3d 2s Qs\n- Position: BB\n- Stack: 357 chips\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- To call: 8 chips\n- Villain: MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: I have bottom pair (3s) with a 6 kicker. The board is dry except for the two spades giving a flush draw possibility. My hand is marginal but I do have a pair.\n\n2. **Opponent info**: Let me recall what I found about MiniMax-M2:\n   - Hand 28: Made a big turn bet of 107\n   - Hand 31: Called preflop then folded\n   - Hand 32: Called preflop then bet 6 on flop\n   - Hand 38: Checked preflop, bet 4 on flop\n   - Hand 40: Called preflop 12, bet 20 on flop and 20 on turn\n\n   Pattern: MiniMax-M2 is fairly active post-flop. When they bet small (like 4, 6, 8), it seems like a probe bet or weak continuation bet. They also make larger bets when they have stronger hands (20, 107).\n\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 40 (32+8), which is 5:1 or 20% equity needed. With bottom pair, I likely have more than 20% equity against a weak betting range.\n\n4. **Position**: I'm out of position which is bad, but the bet is small.\n\n5. **ICM/Tournament**: I'm in decent chip position. This is a low-risk call that could win me a decent pot.\n\n**Decision**: This is a close spot. The small bet size from MiniMax-M2 suggests weakness. \n\nWith bottom pair, I'm ahead of many bluffs and drawing hands. The pot odds are good (5:1). However, I'm out of position and my kicker is terrible.\n\nI think calling is the best option here. Folding is too tight given the pot odds and opponent's weak bet sizing. Raising would be overplaying my hand strength.",

Actually, I have 3-2 on board, so 4-5 would give me a straight, but I don't have either of those cards. So no real straight draw.\n\nActually, I have a pair of 3s with a 6 kicker. The board is 3d 2s Qs Ah. So I have bottom pair.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nMiniMax-M2 has been fairly aggressive. From the recall:\n- They bet on the turn in hand 28 (107 chips)\n- They bet on the flop in hand 32 (6 chips)\n- They bet on the flop and turn in hand 40 (20 chips each)\n\nThey seem to like betting, but the bet sizing on the flop was small (8 into 24 = 1/3 pot).\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 40, I checked, they can now bet. But I have the option to check. Since I have a free option to check, I should check.\n\n**Hand strength:**\n- I have bottom pair (3s)\n- Board has Q and A - very high cards\n- Possible flush draw with 2 spades on board\n- My 6 kicker is weak\n- If MiniMax bets here, they're representing an A, Q, or better\n\n**Position:**\nI'm out of position (BB) against MiniMax who is in middle position.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack (43.6 BB). No need to risk chips with a weak hand.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe action is on me and I can check for free. I should check here. I have a weak hand (bottom pair with bad kicker) and no real draw. The board is scary with an Ace and Queen. If MiniMax bets the turn, I'll likely need to fold unless it's a very small bet.\n\nLet me check.",

They bet with a wide range and put pressure on opponents.\n\nIn this hand:\n- They called preflop (could be wide range)\n- They bet 8 on flop after I checked (could be trying to take it down)\n- They checked back on turn (could be weak, giving up, or pot controlling)\n\n**My hand analysis**:\nI have bottom pair (3s) on a board with Q, A, and 7. This is very weak. The Ace is very scary for my pair of 3s. MiniMax could easily have:\n- Any Ace (they would have top pair)\n- Any Queen (they would have top pair)\n- Any 7 (they would have second pair)\n- Better 3 (3x) - unlikely but possible\n- Air/bluff\n\nGiven that they bet flop and checked turn, they might have:\n1. A weak hand that gave up\n2. A medium-strength hand pot controlling\n3. A monster slowplaying (less likely)\n\nIf I check, I get to showdown for free. If I raise, I'm turning my hand into a bluff. But what can I get them to fold?\n- They might fold weak pairs like 2s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 8s, 9s, Ts\n- They probably don't fold any Ace, Queen, or 7\n- They might fold some draws, but the board doesn't have many draws\n\nThe pot is 40 chips. A raise would need to be at least 8 more (minimum raise to 8 total, but that doesn't make sense - that would be less than the pot). Actually, wait - \"Minimum raise to: 8\" means I can raise TO 8 total, which would be a min-raise of 8 more (since the bet is currently 0). But that seems odd.\n\nLet me reconsider: The \"amount to call\" is 0, so the current bet is 0. The minimum raise would be to 8 (which is the big blind size). So I can check or raise to at least 8.\n\nIf I raise to 8, I'm betting 8 into a pot of 40. That's a very small bet (1/5 pot). It's unlikely to fold out anything decent.\n\n**Decision**: I have a weak hand (bottom pair) on a board with an Ace and Queen. My opponent is aggressive but checked the turn. I should check and go to showdown. Raising is unlikely to accomplish much and risks more chips with a marginal hand. Checking is free and I might win if they have nothing.\n\nLet me check my hand strength one more time:\n- Board: 3d 2s Qs Ah 7h\n- My hand: 6s 3c\n- I have pair of 3s with a 6 kicker\n- This is very weak, especially with an Ace on board\n\nChecking is clearly the best option.",

History shows they tend to bet when they have something (bet 20 on flop/turn in hand #40, bet 8 on flop in hand #43), but also fold preflop frequently. They've folded in 3 of the last 5 hands preflop.\n- **GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5)**: Small blind. They check on the flop now. History shows they fold preflop a lot, but have made some raises (20 and 24 chips). In hand #43, they called preflop, checked flop, then folded to a bet.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Both opponents checked to me\n- Amount to call is 0, so I can check for free\n- The pot is small (24 chips)\n- I have 377 chips (47 BB) - healthy stack\n\n**Decision:**\nI have complete air. There's no reason to bet here:\n1. My hand has 0% equity against any pair\n2. I have no draws or backdoor possibilities\n3. Both opponents have shown weakness by checking\n4. If I bet, I'd be bluffing with no equity and no fold equity against any pair\n5. Checking costs nothing and I can see if I improve on the turn (though it's very unlikely with a 3 and T)\n\nThe only consideration might be a bluff bet to try to take down the small pot, but with two opponents and a King on board, it's very likely at least one has a King or pair. Plus, I have zero equity if called.\n\n\nI should check and see if I get lucky on the turn, though with a 3 and T it's highly unlikely.

Just a 3 and a 10, with a board showing 8-2-K-5. No pair, no straight draw (would need a J and Q or 6 and 7), no flush draw. This is a complete air hand.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n\nFrom MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):\n- Folded preflop in hands 41, 42, 44, 45 (tight)\n- Called preflop and bet on flop in hand 43 (seems to bet when they have something)\n- In hand 40, they bet 20 on flop and turn (showing aggression)\n- Overall: Plays tight preflop, but bets when they enter pots\n\nFrom GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5):\n- Very tight preflop - folded in hands 37, 38, 39, 40, 42\n- Raised preflop in hands 41 and 44\n- Called preflop in hand 43 but folded on flop\n- Overall: Very tight player, only plays strong hands\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Both opponents checked on the flop and the turn (Seat 5 checked turn)\n- This suggests weakness from both players\n- The pot is small (24 chips)\n- I have nothing, but I am in position (acting last)\n\n**Options:**\n1. Check - Showdown with my high card 10 (likely losing)\n2. Bet (bluff) - Try to steal the pot\n\nGiven that both opponents have shown weakness by checking twice, and considering their tight tendencies, a small bluff might work here. However, I need to consider:\n\n- MiniMax has shown they can bet, so they might call or raise if they have any piece\n- GPT-OSS is very tight and likely folds without a strong hand\n- The board has a K, which is scary and might make them fold marginal hands\n\nWith my complete air hand, checking is the safe play. However, this is a tournament and I need to accumulate chips. A small bluff bet could take down this pot.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing: Minimum raise is 8 chips (to 16 total). The pot is 24, so a bet of around 16-20 chips would be a reasonable bluff size.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions more carefully: \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this means the minimum TOTAL amount I can put in is 8 chips (so a bet of 8). But that doesn't make sense given the pot is 24. Let me re-read...\n\n\"Amount to call: 0\" - so it's checked to me. \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this likely means minimum BET is 8 (to add to the existing pot).\n\nGiven I have nothing, but both opponents have shown weakness, and this is a tournament where I need to accumulate chips, I could make a small bluff here. However, the risk is that one of them might have a piece and call or raise.\n\nWith complete air on a K-high board, I think checking is the correct play. I have no equity, no draw, and while the opponents have shown weakness, bluffing with absolutely nothing is generally not profitable long-term, especially when I can see a free showdown with my 10-high (which might occasionally be good if both opponents have complete air too).\n\nLet me check again - the board is K-8-5-2. My 10-high is unlikely to be good at showdown. So checking is just giving up on the pot.\n\nBut wait - both players checked the flop AND the turn. This is a strong indicator of weakness. A small bet might take this down. In tournaments, you need to win these small pots.\n\nI think a small bluff of around 16-20 chips could be profitable here. Let me go with 16 chips (which would be a raise to 16 total).\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise again: \"Minimum raise to: 8\". Given the context and that the pot is 24, I think this might mean the minimum ADDITIONAL amount is 8 (so bet 8 chips). But that seems too small to be meaningful.\n\nLet me reconsider the format. When it says \"Minimum raise to: 8\", and the current pot is 24, I think it's saying the minimum total bet is 8 chips, which would be a very small bet. More likely, it's saying the minimum bet size is 8 chips.\n\nI'll interpret"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me reconsider this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have 3d Th (complete air)\n- Board: 8s 2h Kc 5d (K-high board)\n- Position: BB\n- Stack: 377 chips\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Both opponents checked flop and turn\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Tight preflop, bets when they have something. They called preflop but checked twice.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Very tight, only plays strong hands. They posted SB, called preflop, but checked twice.\n\n**Decision:**\nBoth opponents have shown significant weakness by checking twice. This is a good spot for a bluff. The board has a King which is scary. A small bet could take this down.\n\nHowever, I have absolutely no equity. If I get called or raised, I'm done with the hand. But the pot is 24 chips, which is worth fighting for.\n\nGiven both opponents' tight/passive tendencies and the fact they've checked twice, I think a small bluff is profitable here. I'll bet about 2/3 pot (16 chips).\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Looking at the legal actions: \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this is confusing. If the pot is 24 and it's checked to me, I should be able to bet. The \"raise_to\" field suggests I need to specify the total amount I'm putting in.\n\nGiven the pot is 24 and it's checked to me, if I want to bet 16 chips, that would be a \"raise_to\" of 16 (total amount).\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The format says:\n- \"raise_to\": <number if raising, otherwise null>\n- \"You can only raise if 'raise' is in your legal_actions\"\n\nSince \"raise\" is in my legal_actions, I can bet. If I want to bet 16 chips, I would set \"raise_to\": 16.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Usually in poker notation, \"raise to\" means the total amount. So if the current bet is 0 (checked to me), and I want to bet 16, I would be raising to 16.\n\nLet me go with a conservative approach. Both opponents are tight and have shown weakness. A small bluff is appropriate. I'll bet 16 chips (about 2/3 pot).\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. Looking at the hand history:\n- Seat 5 posted SB of 4\n- Seat 1 (me) posted BB of 8\n- Seat 4 called 8\n- Seat 5 called 4 (completing the call)\n- I checked\n\nSo the pot should be: 8 (my BB) + 8 (Seat 4 call) + 8 (Seat 5 call) = 24. That matches.\n\nNow on the turn, it's checked to me. I can check or bet. If I want to bet, I need to \"raise\" since I'm increasing the bet from 0.\n\nIf the minimum raise is 8, that means the minimum BET is 8 chips. So I could bet anywhere from 8 to my entire stack.\n\nGiven I have complete air, but both opponents have shown weakness, I think a small bluff of 16 chips is appropriate. This is about 2/3 pot and should be enough to get folds from marginal hands.\n\nLet me make a decision: I'll bet 16 chips as a bluff.",

I have:\n1. Position advantage (acting last postflop)\n2. Good pot odds (3:1)\n3. A hand with some potential (Ace-high can be good, and any 3 gives me a pair)\n4. Only one opponent to worry about\n5. Healthy stack size\n\nFolding would be too tight given the position and pot odds. Raising would be overplaying this marginal hand, especially against a relatively tight opponent who might re-raise or call and put me in tough postflop spots.\n\nThe call is the optimal play here.",

They checked to me on this flop, which could mean:\n1. They missed the flop\n2. They have a marginal hand and want to see a free card\n3. They're trapping with a strong hand\n\n**My History:**\nLooking at my recent hands, I've been playing relatively tight. I won a big pot with pocket Kings in hand 42, and have won a few smaller pots. My win rate is about 24% which is reasonable.\n\n**Decision:**\nWith Ace-high on a Q-9-7 board, I have a very weak hand. Even though I'm in position and it checks to me, betting here would be a pure bluff. Given that:\n\n\nI see a potential showdown scenario with limited upside. The opponent's tight-aggressive tendencies suggest they'll likely call or re-raise with any decent hand. Checking provides a risk-free way to gather more information and potentially see a free card that could improve my hand. The tournament context emphasizes preserving chips over speculative bluffs, making a cautious approach more prudent.\n\nWhile Ace-high might occasionally win at showdown, the risks of betting outweigh the potential rewards. Checking allows me to control the pot size and avoid unnecessary chip exposure against an opponent who tends to play strong hands aggressively.\n\nI'll carefully evaluate the turn card's impact on potential draws and hand strength before making any further decisions.",

Check - see a free river card\n2. Bet - try to take down the pot now\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- I only have Ace-high on a coordinated board\n- My opponent checked twice, suggesting weakness\n- I have position advantage\n- The pot is small (16 chips)\n- I could try a small stab at the pot to see if I can take it down\n- However, if I get called, I'm likely behind\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to bet when they have something, and they've checked twice, they likely have a weak hand. A small bet could take down the pot. However, with my weak hand and the coordinated board, checking might be safer to avoid getting involved in a big pot with Ace-high.\n\nI think checking is the better play here. I don't have enough equity to bet for value, and a bluff might not work against this opponent who seems to call when they have something. Checking preserves my stack and gives me a free chance to hit an Ace on the river.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The opponent checked the flop and now the action is on me on the turn. Wait, I need to re-read the action...\n\nLooking at the actions:\n- flop: Seat 1 check (that's me)\n- flop: Seat 4 check (that's MiniMax-M2)\n- Now it's turn, and I need to act\n\nSo the opponent checked the flop, and now it's on me to act on the turn. The \"Amount to call: 0\" means there's no bet to call yet - it's my action.\n\nGiven that the opponent checked the flop, they likely have a weak hand. This is a good spot for a small bluff bet to try to take down the pot. A bet of around 8-12 chips (half pot to 3/4 pot) would be appropriate.\n\nBut wait, I only have Ace-high. Let me think about the board texture again:\n- 7s 9d Qh 8s - this is very coordinated\n- Any T makes a straight (J-T or T-6)\n- Any J makes a straight (J-T)\n- Flush draw is possible\n- My Ace-high is very weak here\n\nIf I bet and get called, I'm likely behind. If I check, I get a free card to possibly hit an Ace.\n\nGiven my weak hand and the coordinated board, I should check. I'm not confident enough in a bluff here, and checking is the safer play that preserves my stack.\n\nActually, you know what - let me reconsider one more time. The opponent checked the flop from the BB after I just called preflop. This is a very weak action. On a board like this, if they had any piece or a decent draw, they'd likely bet. The fact that they checked suggests they have complete air.\n\nThis is actually a good spot for a small bluff bet. I should bet around 8-12 chips to try to take it down. If they call, I can give up on the river unless I improve.\n\nLet me go with a small bet of 12 chips (3/4 pot).",

They checked on the flop, suggesting weakness.\n\n**Current Action:**\nBoth players checked on the flop. This suggests:\n1. Opponent likely has a weak hand or marginal holding\n2. They could have a draw they're checking\n3. They might have a strong hand but are trying to trap (less likely with this board)\n\n**My Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card, see the river. But this gives opponent a free card if they have a draw.\n2. **Bet**: Represent a strong hand, protect against draws, try to take down the pot now.\n\nGiven:\n- I have Ace-high with gutshot draw\n- Opponent shows weakness by checking flop\n- I have position advantage\n- The board is coordinated with potential draws\n\nA small value bet or semi-bluff would be appropriate here.

If they have any pair, I lose.\n- If they have Ace-high with a better kicker, I lose.\n- The only hands I beat are pure bluffs or missed draws.\n- They called on the turn, which suggests they had something.\n- With 3 spades on board, any spade in their hand beats me (flush).\n- The risk vs reward: Pot is 40, I could try to bluff, but I'm out of position and they've shown some strength by calling turn.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 381 chips (47.6 BB) - healthy stack\n- Don't need to take unnecessary risks\n- Checking is free and costs me nothing\n\nI think checking back is the smart play here.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: 7h Th (7\u2665 T\u2665) - This is a suited connector, which has some potential but is not a premium hand.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position at the table. I act last on every street postflop.\n\n**Stack**: 381 chips (47.6 BB) - This is a healthy stack, giving me plenty of room to maneuver.\n\n**Blinds**: 4/8 - So I'm in a tournament with increasing blinds.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 301 chips, in SB\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 292 chips, in BB\n\nLet me analyze the opponent tendencies:\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (SB)**:\n- Has folded preflop many times (hands 39, 41, 42, 44, 45)\n- When they do play, they tend to call or bet (hands 40, 43, 46, 47)\n- On hand 40: called preflop, then bet flop and turn\n- On hand 43: called preflop, bet flop, then checked turn and river\n- On hand 46: called preflop, checked flop, folded turn\n- On hand 47: checked preflop (was BB), checked flop, called turn, checked river\n- Seems to be a relatively passive player who calls more than raises\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B (BB)**:\n- Has raised preflop several times (hands 31, 36, 41, 44) with amounts like 12, 20, 24\n- Folds frequently (hands 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42)\n- On hand 43: called 4, checked flop, then folded\n- On hand 46: called 4, checked flop and turn, then folded turn\n- Seems to be an aggressive player who raises with good hands but folds to pressure\n\n**Current situation**:\n- I have 7h Th on the button\n- It's folded to me\n- SB has posted 4, BB has posted 8\n- I need to call 8 to see the flop\n- I can raise to at least 16\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 7h Th is a suited connector. It's not strong enough to raise for value, but it has good potential if I hit a straight or flush. It's definitely playable from the button.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is a huge advantage. I'll act last postflop, which gives me more information and control.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents seem to fold fairly often. GPT-OSS-120B in the BB has shown aggression when they have strong hands but also folds a lot. MiniMax-M2 in the SB is more passive.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 12 (4+8). I need to call 8 to see the flop. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, which isn't great, but position and implied odds matter more here.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 47.6 BB, I have a comfortable stack. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands from good position.\n\n**Decision**: I should call. Here's why:\n- From the button, I can play more hands profitably\n- 7h Th has good potential for straights and flushes\n- Both opponents have shown they can fold, so I may be able to steal pots postflop\n- Raising would be too aggressive with this hand strength - I don't want to bloat the pot with a marginal hand\n- Calling keeps the pot small and allows me to see the flop cheaply from position\n\nI could consider raising as a steal attempt, but the BB (GPT-OSS-120B) has shown they can raise preflop and might defend their BB. Since I have a marginal hand, it's better to just call and see the flop.\n\nLet me call 8 and see what happens on the flop.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The flop is Jh Jc 4s - a paired board with two Jacks. I have 7h Th which gives me:\n- No pair\n- Backdoor flush draw (hearts)\n- No straight draw\n- Only high card T\n\nThis is a very weak hand on this board. The board is paired which reduces the value of draws and makes it more likely someone has trips or a full house.\n\nLooking at the action:\n- Preflop: I called 8 chips on the button with 7h Th (reasonable speculative hand in position)\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) folded from SB\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) checked in BB\n- On the flop, GPT-OSS-120B checked to me\n\nFrom the opponent history I retrieved:\nGPT-OSS-120B has been fairly passive:\n- Frequently folds preflop\n- When they do see flops, they tend to check and often fold later\n- They check-called preflop in hand 43 then check-folded on flop\n- They check-called preflop in hand 46, checked flop and turn, then folded turn\n\nThis suggests they're playing a relatively tight/passive style.\n\nWith my stack of 373 chips (46.6 BB) and the pot being only 20 chips, I should:\n1. Check behind and see a free turn card - I have some backdoor equity\n2. Consider a small bluff bet, but the paired board is dangerous for bluffing\n3. The opponent's passivity suggests they might have missed this flop too\n\nThe best play here is likely to check. I have position, a weak hand, and a passive opponent. I can:\n- Take a free card to try to improve\n- Pot control with my weak holding\n- Re-evaluate on the turn\n\nIf I bet, I risk getting called by any Jack, any 4, or any pocket pair. The board is scary enough that a bluff might not work, and I don't need to protect anything.\n\nChecking seems like the optimal play here.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 7h Th (7 of hearts, 10 of hearts)\n- Board: Jh Jc 4s 3s (Jack of hearts, Jack of clubs, 4 of spades, 3 of spades)\n- Pot: 20 chips\n- My stack: 373 chips (46.6 BB)\n- Position: BTN\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- The board has two Jacks, making it paired\n- I have a 7 and a 10, both hearts\n- There are 3 spades on the board (4s, 3s, plus the Jh is a heart not spade)\n- Wait, let me recount: Jh (hearts), Jc (clubs), 4s (spades), 3s (spades) - so 2 spades, not 3\n- No straight draws possible with my hand\n- No flush draw (I have hearts, board has spades)\n- My best hand is just high card 10 (since the board is paired Jacks)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's turn actions from the recall:\n- They frequently bet on the turn (hands 1, 2, 6, 10, 18)\n- They've also checked and folded (hands 8, 25, 46)\n- They seem to be an active player who bets frequently\n\n**Current Action:**\n- Preflop: I called 8 from BTN\n- Flop: Both checked\n- Turn: Opponent checked to me\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak - just high card 10 on a paired board\n2. **Position**: Good (on the button)\n3. **Pot size**: Small (20 chips)\n4. **Opponent's check**: Could be weakness or a trap\n5. **My stack**: Healthy at 46.6 BB\n6. **Board texture**: Paired board with potential straight draws (A-5, 5-6, etc.) and flush draw (spades)\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: Free card to see if I improve on river. Low risk.\n- **Bet**: Try to steal the pot. But what would I represent? A Jack? With my preflop call and flop check, betting now would look suspicious.\n- **Fold**: Too weak, and I have a free option to check.\n\n**Opponent's likely range**:\nSince they checked the turn after checking flop, they likely have:\n- Weak made hands (pocket pairs below J, Ace-high)\n- Draws (straight draws, flush draws)\n- Complete air\n\n**My decision**: This is a good spot to try a small bluff. The board is paired which reduces the number of strong hands opponent can have. They've shown weakness by checking twice. I can represent having a Jack or a strong hand that was slowplaying.\n\nHowever, looking at my actual hand, I have very little equity if called. And the pot is small - risking chips to win 20 might not be worth it.\n\nLet me reconsider: The opponent checked the turn. If I bet, I need to size it appropriately. Minimum raise is 8, which would be 8 to win 20 (2.5:1 pot odds for opponent). That's a decent bluff size.\n\nBut wait - I have position and a free card. The risk/reward of checking is better. If I check and the river is a heart, I might pick up a flush draw (though still weak). If the river pairs the board or brings a scare card, I might be able to bluff then.\n\nActually, given that I have no real equity and the opponent has been active, checking is the safer play. I can reevaluate on the river.",

The lack of aggression indicates they might be holding a marginal hand or completely missed the board. \n3. **Strategic Position**: From the button, I have positional advantage. This allows me to potentially steal the pot with a well-timed bluff.\n4. **Risk vs. Reward**: A small bet could potentially win the 20-chip pot, but it carries the risk of being called by a better hand.\n\nThe opponent's passive play and my positional advantage create an interesting bluffing opportunity. However, the board texture and my complete lack of hand strength make this a risky proposition. I'll need to carefully weigh the potential gain against the likelihood of being called.\n\nChecking seems the most prudent move, preserving my stack while avoiding unnecessary risk. The potential reward doesn't justify the gamble with such a weak hand.",

It's suited (spade) but not connected (8 and 10 with a gap). This is:\n- Not a premium hand\n- Some potential to make straights or flushes\n- Better in position (which I am - on the button)\n- Good for stealing blinds\n\n**Opponent Analysis - MiniMax-M2:**\nFrom the opponent actions I just recalled:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been folding preflop quite frequently (hands 41, 42, 44, 45, 48, 49)\n- When they do call preflop, they tend to bet on the flop (hands 40, 43)\n- They seem to be playing somewhat tight/passive\n- They check a lot on later streets\n\n**Position and Stack:**\n- I'm on the BTN, which is the best position post-flop\n- I have a healthy stack (49 BB)\n- This is a good spot to try to steal the blinds with a marginal hand\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Need to call 4 to win 12 (3:1 odds)\n- This is good for seeing a flop, but with my marginal hand, I might prefer to either steal or fold\n\n**Decision:**\nWith a marginal hand like 8s Th in position, and facing a tight opponent who folds frequently, this is a perfect spot for a steal attempt. Raising to 16 (2x BB) is a standard steal size. If they call, I have position and can evaluate the flop.\n\nLet me consider the options:\n1. Fold: Too tight, I'm giving up too much equity in position\n2. Call: I could call and see a flop, but with a marginal hand I'd prefer to take it down preflop or have initiative\n3. Raise: Steal attempt. 16 chips is a good size - it's the minimum raise which is enough to put pressure on the BB.\n\nI think raising is the best play here.",

That's 8 outs (4 sixes and 4 queens). \n\n**Pot**: 32 chips\n**Stack**: 381 chips (47.6 BB)\n**Position**: Button\n**Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 in BB with 285 chips\n\n**Action so far**: \n- Preflop: I raised to 16 from SB (button), BB called 8 more\n\n**Current situation**: It's checked to me, I can check or bet.\n\nLet me analyze what I learned about MiniMax-M2:\n- From the recall data, MiniMax-M2 tends to fold preflop quite a bit (hands 41, 42, 44, 45, 48, 49)\n- When they do call preflop and bet on the flop (hands 40, 43), they make small bets (20 and 8 respectively)\n- They sometimes check-call or check-fold later streets\n- They seem to be a relatively straightforward, somewhat tight player\n\n**My straight draw**: I have 8 outs out of 47 unknown cards = ~17% chance to hit on the turn. With implied odds, this could be profitable.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the button, which is great. I have the betting lead.\n\n**Decision**: I should consider betting here because:\n1. I have a strong draw (open-ended straight)\n2. I have position\n3. I was the preflop aggressor, so a continuation bet makes sense\n4. If I check, I give a free card and lose initiative\n5. A bet can fold out some better hands or get value from worse draws\n\nHowever, I need to be careful because:\n- The board has a flush draw (spades) that I don't have\n- If MiniMax-M2 has a strong hand, they may check-raise\n\nGiven my stack size (47.6 BB) and the pot size (32), I should make a standard continuation bet of about 1/2 to 2/3 pot, which would be 16-21 chips. Let me bet around 16-20 chips to keep the pot manageable but apply pressure.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions, the minimum raise to is 8, but that's the minimum additional bet. Since the pot is 32, a proper c-bet would be more like 16-20. Let me bet 16 chips, which is half pot and also matches my preflop raise size.",

If I check, I get to see the river for free.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: I have a straight, which is very strong. However, there's a potential flush draw on board (3 spades). If the river comes another spade, I could lose to a flush.\n\n2. **Opponent's range**: Given their passive play and that they called my flop bet, they could have:\n   - A made hand (pair, two pair, set)\n   - A draw (flush draw, straight draw)\n   - A weaker made hand that they're calling with\n\n3. **Position**: I'm in position (BTN), which is good. I get to act last.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 333 chips, opponent has 237 chips. The pot is 128, so it's getting significant relative to stacks.\n\n5. **Betting pattern**: I bet the flop and they called. This suggests they have something. They could have a J, a 9, a T, a draw, or possibly already have a flush.\n\n**Decision**:\nI have a strong hand (straight), but the board is dangerous with a flush draw. I should bet for value and protection. I want to:\n1. Get value from worse hands (pairs, two pairs, sets, weaker straights)\n2. Charge draws to continue\n3. Potentially get all-in if they have a strong hand\n\nGiven the pot is 128 and they have 237 chips left, a good sizing would be around 2/3 pot to pot-sized bet. Let's say 96-128 chips.\n\nSince the minimum raise is 48, but I want to bet more for value and protection. I should bet around 96 chips (3/4 pot) to charge flush draws and get value from worse made hands.\n\nActually, looking at the betting again - I bet 48 on flop, they called. Pot is now 128. I should continue betting for value. A bet of 96 seems appropriate.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The amount to call is 0, so I can check. But I should bet for value. The minimum raise to value is 48, but that's too small. I want to bet more like 80-96.\n\nLet me think about the exact amount. If I bet 96:\n- Pot becomes 224\n- They have 237-48 = 189 left (they called 48 on flop from starting stack of 237)\n- Actually, wait: They started with 237, called 8 preflop, so 229 left. Then called 48 on flop, so 181 left.\n\nIf I bet 96 and they call, pot becomes 128+96+96 = 320, and they have 85 left. Then river would be easy to get all-in.\n\nIf I bet 80, pot becomes 128+80+80 = 288, they have 101 left.\n\nI think betting 80 is a good size - it's a substantial value bet that charges draws but doesn't necessarily commit them if they have a weak hand.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully. I have a straight. The board has 3 spades. I have the 8s, so if another spade comes, I have a straight flush draw but would lose to any made flush.\n\nThe key is: should I bet or check? I think betting is correct for value and protection. The question is how much.\n\nGiven the pot is 128, and stacks are relatively shallow now, I should bet around 2/3 pot or more. Let's"

If I check, I get to see the river for free.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: I have a straight, which is very strong. However, there's a potential flush draw on board (3 spades). If the river comes another spade, I could lose to a flush.\n\n2. **Opponent's range**: Given their passive play and that they called my flop bet, they could have:\n   - A made hand (pair, two pair, set)\n   - A draw (flush draw, straight draw)\n   - A weaker made hand that they're calling with\n\n3. **Position**: I'm in position (BTN), which is good. I get to act last.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 333 chips, opponent has 237 chips. The pot is 128, so it's getting significant relative to stacks.\n\n5. **Betting pattern**: I bet the flop and they called. This suggests they have something. They could have a J, a 9, a T, a draw, or possibly already have a flush.\n\n**Decision**:\nI have a strong hand (straight), but the board is dangerous with a flush draw. I should bet for value and protection. I want to:\n1. Get value from worse hands (pairs, two pairs, sets, weaker straights)\n2. Charge draws to continue\n3. Potentially get all-in if they have a strong hand\n\nGiven the pot is 128 and they have 237 chips left, a good sizing would be around 2/3 pot to pot-sized bet.

Let me go with 80 chips as a solid value bet that charges draws but doesn't overcommit against a potential made flush.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider the bet sizing. The pot is 128. If I bet 80 (roughly 2/3 pot):\n- Opponent has to call 80 to win 208 (128+80), getting about 2.6:1 odds\n- This is about right for a flush draw (needs 4:1 odds, but they have implied odds)\n\nIf I bet 96 (3/4 pot):\n- Opponent gets about 2.3:1 odds\n- Better for charging draws\n\nGiven the opponent is passive and tends to call with weaker hands, I should bet for value. I'll bet 96 to charge the flush draw more heavily while still getting called by worse.\n\nBut actually, thinking about it more - with a straight on a 3-flush board, I want to get value but also protect. Betting around 2/3 pot (80-85) seems right.\n\nLet me go with 80 chips. It's a solid value bet that:\n1. Gets value from worse hands (pairs, two pairs, sets, weaker straights)\n2.

Sets up a river shove if they call\n\nActually, I just realized - if I bet 80 and they call, pot becomes 288, they have 101 left. On the river, I can comfortably shove for value.\n\nIf they raise, I need to be concerned about a made flush or possibly a higher straight (but Q-K would be the only higher straight possible, which is unlikely given the betting).\n\nI'll bet 80 for value and protection.",

Seems to be a somewhat tight/passive player.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Very passive, has folded preflop multiple times (hands 47, 49, 50), and when they do see flops, they're checking through. Very tight/passive.\n\nWith 8-3 offsuit, this is one of the worst starting hands in poker. Even in position, this is an easy fold. The hand has:\n- No high card value\n- No suitedness\n- No connectivity (gap of 5 cards)\n- Very low potential to make strong hands\n\nGiven I'm on the button, I could theoretically try to steal with any two cards against weak opponents, but 8-3 offsuit is just too weak. Even if both opponents fold 70% of the time, the risk/reward isn't worth it with this hand.\n\nThe pot is only 12 chips (1.5 BB), so there's not much to fight for. Better to preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nDecision: FOLD",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand**: 9c 2s - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected with a gap. This is typically a folding hand in almost all situations.\n\n**Position**: BB (Seat 1) - I'm in the worst position post-flop.\n\n**Stack**: 453 chips (56.6 BB) - Healthy stack, no pressure.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Pot: 24 chips\n- SB posted 4, I posted BB 8, Seat 4 called 8, Seat 5 called 4\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\nSo the action is back to me after Seat 4 called and Seat 5 called. I can check for free.\n\nLet me think about what to do:\n1. **Hand strength**: 9c 2s is trash. Very low equity against any reasonable calling range.\n2. **Pot odds**: I can check for free, so checking gives me infinite pot odds to see the flop.\n3. **Position**: I'll be out of position post-flop, which is bad.\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called from MP with 225 chips (28 BB) - short stack\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called SB with 284 chips (35.5 BB) - also somewhat short\n\nSince I can check for free, I should check. Raising would be terrible with this hand - I'd be building a pot with a weak hand out of position. Folding is possible but unnecessary since checking is free and I have some chance to hit a miracle flop (though very unlikely).\n\nI should check and see the flop. This is a clear check situation.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - with 9-2 offsuit, even checking might not be great because:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. I have very little chance to improve to a strong hand\n3. If I hit a 9, I'll often be dominated by better 9s\n\n\n4. If I hit a 2, same issue\n\nI'll play cautiously and check, hoping for an unexpected favorable flop despite the hand's inherent weaknesses. The free opportunity to see the flop minimizes my risk while preserving a slim chance of improvement.",

The bet sizing suggests strength (or at least a legitimate attempt to win the pot). Even if they're bluffing, I have no showdown value and would be drawing nearly dead. This is an easy fold.\n\nI should not try to get creative here - I have a trash hand and should preserve my chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: A\u2660 5\u2660 - Ace-five suited. This is a decent speculative hand, especially from the button position. I have a suited ace which gives me nut flush potential and can make strong top pair hands.\n\n**Position**: BTN (button) - This is the best position in poker. I get to act last postflop, which gives me a significant advantage.\n\n**Stack**: 449 chips (56.1 BB) - This is a healthy stack. I have room to play postflop poker.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): 233 chips - This player has been relatively tight. They folded preflop in hands 48, 49, 51, and raised in hand 53. They called in hands 50 and 52 but folded on later streets. This suggests they're somewhat cautious.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): 292 chips - This player seems passive, making lots of checks and folds. They only called in hand 52 and made one bet on the flop in that hand. They folded in hand 53 after calling preflop.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to win 12 chips (1.5:1 odds). This is reasonable for a speculative hand like A5s from the button.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n1. With A5s on the button, this is a clear raise or call situation\n2. Given my position advantage and the passive nature of both opponents, I should be looking to steal the blinds or play a pot in position\n3. A5s has good playability postflop - can make nut flushes, straights, and top pair hands\n4. Both opponents appear to be somewhat tight/passive based on their recent actions\n\n**Decision**: I should raise here. Here's why:\n- I have position advantage\n- My hand has good speculative value\n- Both opponents have shown tendencies to fold or play passively\n- Raising gives me initiative and can win the pot preflop\n- Even if called, I have a hand that plays well postflop in position\n\nA standard raise would be to about 3x the big blind, so 24 chips total. Since the minimum raise is 16, I can raise to 24. This is a good size that puts pressure on the blinds while not risking too many chips.\n\nLet me raise to 24 chips.",

This is a marginal hand.\n- The board is 9h 3s 6h - there are potential flush draws and straight draws.\n- My 9 is vulnerable to overcards and better 9s.\n- The 5 kicker is very weak.\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 48: checked flop, turn, river (passive)\n- Hands 49-50: preflop folds\n- Hand 52: called preflop 4, then bet 40 on flop (big bet)\n- Hand 53: called preflop 8, then folded (showing some selectivity)\n- Hand 54: preflop fold\n\nThe opponent seems to bet big when they have something (40 chip bet in hand 52), but they also check a lot. Their current bet is only 8 into a 32 pot (1/4 pot), which is a weak/small bet.\n\n**My Recent Play:**\n- Hand 50: Won with 8s Th (was aggressive with raises and bets)\n- Hand 52: Folded BB with 9c 2s on 7c 7h Js board\n- Hand 54: Won with As 5s preflop raise\n\n**Position and Stack:**\n- I'm in BB position\n- I have a healthy stack of 56.6 BB\n- Pot is 32, bet to call is 8 (getting 4:1 odds)\n\n**Decision:**\nI have bottom pair with a weak kicker. The board has potential draws. The opponent's small bet suggests weakness or a draw. However, my hand is marginal and vulnerable.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold - too weak given the small bet and pot odds\n2. Call - getting 4:1 odds, but could be facing better hands/draws\n3. Raise - could take down the pot now, but would commit chips with a weak hand\n\nGiven the small bet size (8 into 32 pot), I think calling is reasonable. I'm getting good odds and the opponent's betting pattern suggests they could be weak. However, I need to be careful on later streets.\n\nLet me reconsider: I have bottom pair, weak kicker, on a draw-heavy board. The opponent bet 1/4 pot, which is often a weak bet or a probe bet. I could raise to take control, but that would commit chips with a marginal hand. A call seems best to see the turn and re-evaluate.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the opponent's pattern:\n- In hand 52, they called preflop small (4) then made a big bet (40) on the flop\n- Now they bet small (8) into a 32 pot\n\nThis inconsistent sizing suggests they might not have a strong hand. But with my weak kicker, I should be cautious.\n\nI'll call the 8 chip bet to see the turn. It's a small investment relative to the pot, and I have position on the opponent.",

This means I need ~38% equity to call.\n\n**Opponent analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the opponent actions I see that GPT-OSS-120B:\n- Has been relatively passive postflop\n- Often checks and folds\n- Made a large bet on the flop in hand 52 (40 chips)\n- In hand 53, called preflop then folded\n- Generally seems to bet when they have something\n\n**The betting pattern this hand:**\n- Preflop: Seat 4 called, Seat 5 (SB) called, I checked\n- Flop: Seat 5 bet 8 (small bet), I called, Seat 4 called\n- Turn: Seat 5 bets 80 (very large bet relative to pot)\n\nThe turn bet is a massive overbet (80 into a 128 pot). This suggests:\n1. A very strong hand (trip 3s, full house, maybe a flush that hit)\n2. A complete bluff trying to push us out\n3. Could have a 6 and be protecting against the flush draw\n\nGiven that Seat 5 called preflop from SB, they could have:\n- Any suited connector, any pair, any Ax, any broadway\n- On the flop they bet small (8 into 24 pot) - could be a probe bet or weak lead\n- On the turn they bomb it - this is suspicious\n\n**My hand strength:** I have two pair (9s and 3s). This is a decent hand but vulnerable to:\n- Any 3 (trip 3s)\n- Any higher pair\n- Any straight draw that hit\n- Any flush that hit (hearts)\n\n**My position:** I'm in the BB and already invested. I called the flop bet of 8.\n\n**Decision:** The large overbet on the turn is concerning. With my two pair, I'm probably ahead of many hands but I'm not strong enough to call such a large bet. The pot odds are not great (need ~38% equity), and I think I'm good less than that against this action.\n\nI should fold here. The risk to my tournament stack (445 chips) is too high for marginal hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent actions for MiniMax-M2 (the only active opponent left):\n\nFrom the data:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been relatively tight preflop, folding 6 times out of 10 recorded preflop actions\n- When they do play, they often just call rather than raise (calling 4 times, raising only once)\n- They tend to be passive postflop with many checks and folds\n- They called a 48 chip bet on the flop once (hand #50), suggesting they can have some stronger hands\n\nMy situation:\n- Position: BTN (best position)\n- Cards: Qs 9d (offsuit, decent but not premium)\n- Stack: 441 chips (55.1 BB) - healthy\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- Need to call 4 to see flop\n- Can raise to 16 minimum\n\nWith Q9o on the button facing only the BB (MiniMax-M2), this is a reasonable hand to play. I'm getting 4:1 immediate pot odds to call (12:4 = 3:1, but there will be more chips to win postflop).\n\nThe opponent seems relatively tight/passive. From the button with Q9o, I have a few options:\n\n1. Fold - too tight, Q9o is playable from button\n2. Call - see flop in position with a decent hand\n3. Raise - try to take it down preflop or build pot with position\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm on the button (positional advantage)\n- Opponent is tight/passive\n- My hand has decent equity\n- I have a healthy stack\n\nI think a raise is appropriate here. A standard raise would be to about 3x the BB, so around 24 chips. However, the minimum raise is 16. I could either:\n- Raise to 24 (3x BB) as a standard steal attempt\n- Call and play postflop in position\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to fold preflop (6/10 times) and call rather than 3-bet, a raise seems like a good play. I'll raise to 24 to put pressure and potentially take down the pot preflop. If called, I'll have position and can evaluate the flop.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The minimum raise is 16, which is 2x the BB. A raise to 24 (3x BB) might be better. Let me make it 24 to make it a proper raise size.",

Decent for stealing and can make strong hands like straights and flushes.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the BTN, best position post-flop. Only MiniMax-M2 in BB to act after me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** Looking at the data for MiniMax-M2:\n   - They fold preflop quite often (hands 48, 49, 51, 54, 56, 58)\n   - When they do play, they tend to call rather than raise (hands 50, 52, 55, 57)\n   - They'll occasionally raise (hand 53)\n   - Post-flop, they can be passive (checking hands 47, 57)\n   - They fold to pressure (hand 50 turn, hand 52 flop, hand 55 turn)\n\n4. **My BTN history:** Looking at my recent BTN play:\n   - I often fold weak hands (30, 38, 45, 51, 57)\n   - I raise with strong hands (26, 34, 42, 54)\n   - I've called with speculative hands like 7h Th (hand 48) which won\n\n5. **Stack considerations:** \n   - I have 56.6 BB, healthy stack\n   - MiniMax has 26.1 BB, shorter but still playable\n   - This is a good spot to apply pressure\n\n**Decision:** With 5s 6h on BTN facing only the BB, this is a good stealing spot. The opponent folds preflop often. Even if called, I have position and a hand that can make strong draws.\n\nOptions:\n- **Fold:** Too tight, this is a profitable spot\n- **Call:** Could see a flop cheaply, but doesn't apply pressure\n- **Raise:** Good option, puts pressure on BB who folds a lot\n\nI should raise to steal the blinds. A standard raise would be 3x BB = 24 chips, but minimum is 16. Given the opponent folds a lot, even a min-raise might work. However, I should make it a standard size.\n\nLet me raise to 24 (3x BB). This is 20 more to call for the opponent, which is significant relative to their 209 chip stack.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Now I need to analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 5h 6h (suited connectors)\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - best position\n**Stack**: 465 chips (58.1 BB)\n**Blinds**: 4/8\n**Pot**: 12 chips\n**To call**: 8 chips\n\n**Opponents**:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): 205 chips, just posted SB\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): 304 chips, just posted BB\n\nLet me analyze the opponent tendencies:\n\n**MiniMax-M2 observations**:\n- Plays fairly straightforward, calls preflop raises with marginal hands (hand 40, 43, 46, 52, 55)\n- Makes continuation bets postflop (hands 40, 43, 46, 52)\n- Sometimes folds to aggression (hands 46, 50, 52, 55)\n- Has made raises (hand 53) and folds to aggression\n- Stack is 205 chips (25.6 BB) - getting short\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B observations**:\n- More aggressive preflop raiser (hands 41, 44, 54)\n- Makes large bets postflop (hand 52: 40 on flop, hand 55: 80 on turn)\n- Defends BB sometimes (hands 43, 46, 52, 55)\n- Can fold to aggression (hands 40, 41, 42, 44, 46, 54, 56, 59)\n- Stack is 304 chips (38 BB)\n\n**My analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 5h6h is a decent suited connector. It has good postflop playability and can make straights and flushes. On the button, this is a strong speculative hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button - the best position. I have position on both players postflop.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: Both opponents have relatively short stacks compared to mine. I have leverage.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - MiniMax-M2 plays straightforward and can fold to aggression\n   - GPT-OSS-120B is more aggressive but can also fold to aggression\n   - Both have shown they can fold to raises\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 58 BB, I have a healthy stack. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position. Stealing blinds is also valuable.\n\n**Decision**: \n- I have a good speculative hand in the best position\n- Both opponents are relatively short-stacked\n- I can either call and see a cheap flop with position, or raise to try to steal\n- Given that both opponents can fold to aggression, and I have position, a raise is good\n- A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 24 chips\n\nI should raise to 24 chips. This gives me good fold equity, and if called, I have position and a hand with good postflop potential.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Button with suited connectors (5h6h) is a strong speculative hand.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in the SB with 5s 8h - a very weak hand\n- My stack: 477 chips (29.8 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 72 chips\n- GPT-OSS-120B raised to 48 (3x BB)\n- I need to call 40 chips\n- Current pot odds: 72:40 or 1.8:1\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n5s 8h is a trash hand. It's not suited, not connected, and doesn't have any high cards. This is an easy fold in most situations.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has been raising preflop frequently with amounts ranging from 4 to 24 chips. The current raise of 48 is significantly larger than their typical raises, suggesting they might have a strong hand. They've been active and aggressive preflop.\n\n**Position and Stack:**\n- I'm in SB, which is the worst position\n- I have a healthy stack of 29.8 BB\n- Calling would commit 40 chips (about 8.4% of my stack) with a terrible hand\n- I could potentially raise to 80, but that would be 16.8% of my stack with 58\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- My stack is healthy at 29.8 BB\n- No need to take unnecessary risks\n- Better spots will come\n- The opponent's large raise (3x BB) suggests strength\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nI need to call 40 to win 72, which is 1.8:1 odds. I would need about 35.7% equity to make this call profitable. 58 has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 58 offsuit is one of the worst hands in poker. I have good stack depth, no need to gamble. The opponent's raise sizing suggests strength, and I'm out of position.",

J6o is well below any reasonable preflop calling/raising range.\n\n**Position:** BB - I'm out of position postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 461 chips (28.8 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- MiniMax-M2 raised from 16 to 32 (2x the BB)\n- GPT-OSS-120B called from SB\n- I need to call 16 more to see a flop\n\n**Opponent tendencies from the recall:**\n- **MiniMax-M2:** Has been very tight, folding most hands preflop. Only called twice in the last 10 actions. This raise suggests a strong hand.\n- **GPT-OSS-120B:** Also quite tight, folding many hands. Called a raise in Hand 62 and then bet on the flop. In Hand 63, just checked through.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** J6o is a trash hand. It's not suited, not connected, and the Jack is weak kicker.\n2. **Pot odds:** I need to call 16 to win a pot of 80 (5:1 odds). While this seems decent, the implied odds are terrible with this hand.\n3. **Opponent strength:** MiniMax-M2's raise from early position (seat 4) with their tight image suggests a strong hand. GPT-OSS-120B's call also suggests some strength.\n4. **Position:** I'll be out of position against two opponents.\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With 28.8 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. This is an easy fold. J6o is not a defendable hand even getting decent odds, especially against a tight raiser and a caller. I should wait for a better spot.",

They can be aggressive but also passive. The raise to 32 here could be a standard open or could indicate strength.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\nJd 3s is a terrible hand. It's offsuit, disconnected, and has no real playability. Even from the SB where I'm getting a discount, this is a clear fold.\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions\n- I have a healthy stack of 28.3 BB, so no pressure to gamble\n- The pot is offering me 56:24 or about 2.33:1 odds, but even with those odds, J3o is not worth calling\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a decent stack and should preserve it\n- No need to get involved with marginal hands from bad position\n- The opponent's raise shows some strength, and I'll be out of position post-flop\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a clear fold. J3o is just too weak to call a raise from the SB, especially when I'll be out of position post-flop and have no real way to win the hand other than hitting a miracle flop.",

When they raise preflop, they tend to be passive postflop (checking through).\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B (BB, Seat 5):**\n- Hand 62: Bet 80 on flop\n- Hand 63: Checked through all streets after checking preflop\n- Hand 64: Called 24 preflop, then checked through all streets\n- Hand 65: Raised preflop to 32\n- Pattern: Also mixed, but seems more aggressive postflop when they bet (hand 62). Has shown both calling and raising preflop.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 7d Jh is marginal. It's offsuit, not connected, and only one high card (J). This is a fold in most situations.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is great, but that doesn't make this hand strong enough.\n3. **Pot odds**: Need to call 16 to win 24, so 1.5:1 odds. Not great for a marginal hand.\n4. **Stack preservation**: With 28.3 BB, I have a healthy stack but shouldn't waste chips on marginal hands.\n\n\n5. **Opponent ranges**: Both opponents have shown aggressive preflop actions. A raise would likely trigger a strong response, potentially putting my stack at risk. The potential for facing a 3-bet makes playing this hand even more dangerous, especially with my marginal holding.\n\nI'll fold this hand. The combination of weak cards, unfavorable pot odds, and risk of aggressive opponent action makes it an easy decision. Preserving my 28.3 BB stack is more valuable than speculating with a low-probability hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n**My hand**: 5c 4d (off-suit)\n**Board**: 2h 3d 9s\n**Position**: BB\n**Stack**: 437 chips (27.3 BB)\n**Pot**: 128 chips\n**Facing**: Bet of 80 from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)\n\n**Hand analysis**: I have 5c 4d on a 2h 3d 9s flop. This gives me:\n- An open-ended straight draw (need a 6 or an Ace to complete the straight)\n- 8 outs (4 sixes, 4 aces)\n- Runner-runner flush draw (very unlikely, not worth considering)\n- Backdoor straight possibilities but not relevant\n\n**Pot odds**: Pot is 128 + 80 = 208 chips, and I need to call 80. So 208:80 or about 2.6:1. I need roughly 28% equity to call (80/(208+80)).\n\n**My equity**: With 8 outs, I have about 16% chance to hit on the turn (8/47), and about 32% to hit by the river. With one card to come, I'm getting 2.6:1 pot odds but only have ~4:1 odds against hitting. So this is not a profitable call based purely on pot odds.\n\n**Opponent analysis**: From the recall:\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Recently has been passive (lots of checking, folding), but just made a bet of 80 into 128 pot - that's a strong bet\n- MiniMax-M2: Only has 125 chips left, hasn't been very aggressive\n\n**Tournament considerations**: I'm in decent shape with 27.3 BB. Calling 80 would cost me ~18% of my stack. This is a borderline situation.\n\n**The bet size**: 80 into 128 is a strong bet - about 62.5% pot. This suggests strength from GPT-OSS-120B.\n\n**My decision**: While I have a decent draw, the pot odds aren't quite there, and this would commit a significant portion of my stack. I should fold.",

It's not connected enough for straight draws, no flush potential, and low card strength.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Hand 67: Called preflop 16, called flop 80, checked turn/river\n- Hand 66: Called preflop 8, checked flop, bet turn 16\n- Hand 65: Folded preflop\n- Hand 64: Checked turn and river\n\nThis opponent seems to defend their blind sometimes but isn't overly aggressive. They can fold preflop (Hand 65) and seem to play somewhat passively postflop.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm on the Button, which is great position, but with such a weak hand, position advantage is limited.\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\n- I have 26.8 BB, which is a decent stack\n- MiniMax-M2 has 237 chips (14.8 BB), shorter stack\n- I should avoid bloating pots with marginal hands against shorter stacks\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nNeed to call 8 to win 24, getting 3:1 odds. But with 68o, even these odds don't justify calling.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- 26.8 BB is not a desperate stack\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Better to preserve chips for better opportunities\n\n**Decision:**\nFold. This is a trivial fold. 68o is one of the worst hands in poker, and while I'm getting decent pot odds and have position, it's just not worth investing chips with such a weak holding.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- My Position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- My Cards: Qs 9s (Queen of spades, 9 of spades) - suited connector, decent but not premium\n- My Stack: 429 chips (26.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 253 chips (15.8 BB) - in SB\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 280 chips (17.5 BB) - in BB\n\n**Opponent Tendencies from Recall:**\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (SB):**\n- Hand 64: Checked turn and river (passive)\n- Hand 65: Preflop fold\n- Hand 66: Called 8 preflop, checked flop, bet 16 on turn (somewhat aggressive when they enter)\n- Hand 67: Called 16 preflop, called 80 on flop, checked turn and river (calling station tendencies)\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B (BB):**\n- Hand 65: Raised to 32 preflop (aggressive)\n- Hand 66: Checked preflop and flop, folded turn\n- Hand 67: Called 8 preflop, bet 80 on flop, checked turn and river\n- Hand 68: Preflop fold\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Q9s is a decent suited hand from the button. It has good playability postflop and can make strong hands like straights, flushes, or top pair.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last on all postflop streets.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes**: I have a healthy 26.8 BB stack. The opponents have mid-stacks (15.8 BB and 17.5 BB), which means they're not desperate yet but can't be too reckless.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: \n   - MiniMax seems to call a lot and be somewhat passive\n   - GPT-OSS shows some aggression (raised preflop in hand 65, bet flop in hand 67)\n   - Both players have shown they can fold\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: With 26.8 BB, I can afford to see flops with speculative hands, especially in position. Q9s is definitely playable from the button.\n\n**Decision**: I should raise here. Being on the button with a suited hand, I want to:\n- Build the pot when I have position\n- Potentially take down the blinds preflop\n- Set myself up to win postflop with position advantage\n\nA standard raise would be to 3x the big blind = 48 chips. Since the minimum raise is 32, 48 is a good size - it's enough to put pressure but not commit too many chips.\n\nLet me raise to 48 chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My position: BTN (Button)\n- My cards: Th 3d (T\u2665 3\u2666) - very weak hand\n- My stack: 437 chips (27.3 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B in SB with 264 chips\n\n**Action:**\n- SB posted 8\n- I posted BB 16\n- One player folded\n- SB called for 8 (completing the small blind)\n\n**Decision Point:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Th 3d is a terrible hand, offsuit with no connectivity\n- Only 24% equity against random hand\n- Even worse against any reasonable calling range\n- On the button, I have position advantage\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data, I see:\n- Hand 62: Raised preflop 48, bet flop 80 (aggressive)\n- Hand 63: Checked through (passive)\n- Hand 64: Called 24 preflop, checked through (passive)\n- Hand 65: Raised preflop 32 (aggressive)\n- Hand 66: Checked preflop, folded turn (passive)\n- Hand 67: Called 8 preflop, bet 80 on flop (tricky - passive pre, aggressive post)\n- Hand 68-69: Folded preflop (tight)\n\nPattern: Mixed strategy, sometimes aggressive preflop, sometimes passive. When they just call from SB (like now), they could have:\n- Weak hands just trying to see a flop cheaply\n- Medium strength hands\n- Sometimes traps\n\n**Position and Stack Considerations:**\n- I'm on the button with position advantage\n- I have a healthy stack (27.3 BB)\n- Opponent has 264 chips (16.5 BB) - shorter stack\n- Pot is small (32 chips)\n\n\n- Checking is completely free\n- Raising would risk chips with a very weak hand\n- Folding would give up the BB I already put in, but it's only 16 chips\n\nI'll take a free flop in position with my weak hand. The pot's small enough that checking costs nothing, and I might catch something on the board. With 27.3 BB, I can afford to see a cheap flop and potentially outplay my opponent post-flop. The risk of raising with Th 3d far outweighs any potential reward, especially against an opponent with a shorter stack who might be tempted to defend aggressively.\n\nChecking keeps me in the hand with zero additional investment, preserving my stack while maintaining positional advantage. It's the most strategically sound move given my current hand strength and table dynamics.",

My pair of 3s is very weak on this board - the King is a high card and the flush draw makes my hand even more vulnerable.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (button), which is good position post-flop. I get to act last.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Only one opponent remains (Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B) with 264 chips. They posted the small blind and called preflop, then checked on the flop.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 32 chips, and it's free to check.

I shouldn't risk chips with such a weak hand.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- I have bottom pair on a board with a King and a flush draw\n- My opponent checked, showing weakness\n- However, my hand is extremely vulnerable. Any club gives someone a flush, any King gives them top pair, and there are many overcards that could beat me\n- Even if my opponent is weak, I have very little to gain by betting here\n- Checking gives me a free card to see if I improve to trips (though unlikely)\n- Betting would be a bluff, but I have no fold equity with such a weak hand and my opponent already invested chips preflop\n\n**Decision**: Check. There's nothing to gain by betting here. My hand is too weak to value bet, and I don't have enough fold equity to bluff. Checking is free and allows me to see the turn card without risking chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n**My hand**: Th 3d (Ten of hearts, Three of diamonds)\n**Board**: Kc 3c 7c 4h\n**Position**: BTN (Button)\n**Stack**: 437 chips (27.3 BB)\n**Pot**: 32 chips\n**Action**: Opponent checked to me on the turn\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have a weak hand. I have a pair of 3s with a Ten kicker. The board shows:\n   - Kc 3c 7c: Three clubs on the board (potential flush)\n   - 4h: Fourth card\n   - I have no clubs in my hand, so I don't have a flush draw\n   - I have a pair of 3s, which is very weak on this board\n\n2. **Board texture**: Very dangerous board with three clubs. Anyone with a club has a flush draw, and someone could already have a made flush. The King is also a high card that could easily be in my opponent's range.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively passive:\n   - Frequently checks (hands 63, 64, 66, 67)\n   - Sometimes makes big bets (bet 80 on flop in hands 62 and 67)\n   - Has folded preflop recently (hands 68, 69)\n   - Made a turn fold in hand 66\n   - Overall seems to be a somewhat passive player who occasionally makes big bets\n\n4. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position, but with a weak hand that doesn't matter much.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is 32 chips and I can check for free. If I bet, I risk chips with a very weak hand.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 27.3 BB, which is a healthy stack. I shouldn't be risking chips with such a weak hand on a dangerous board.\n \nThe situation is clear: I have a marginal hand with no real chance of improvement. Checking is the most prudent move, preserving my chip stack and avoiding unnecessary risk on a potentially dangerous board. The opponent's passive tendencies further support a conservative approach, making a check the safest strategic decision.",

Q-high is marginal, and the 6 doesn't help much. This is a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions post-flop. I'll be out of position against both opponents.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** From the recall data, MiniMax-M2:\n   - Folds preflop frequently (hands 65, 69, 70)\n   - Calls sometimes (hands 66, 67)\n   - When they see flops, they can be aggressive (bet 16 on turn in hand 66, called 80 on flop in hand 67)\n   - Overall seems somewhat tight but capable of calling and playing post-flop\n\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 8 chips to win 40 chips, which is 5:1 pot odds. This is attractive, but with Q6o, even these odds don't justify calling given how weak my hand is.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With 28.8 BB, I'm in decent shape. I don't need to gamble with a weak hand from a bad position. Preserving my stack is important.\n\n6. **The call from GPT-OSS-120B:** This suggests they might have something, or they could just be calling with a wide range. But even if they're weak, I'm still out of position against two players with a terrible hand.\n \nThe numbers confirm this is a clear fold. The pot odds and hand strength simply don't justify staying in the hand. I'll lose more chips than I'll gain by calling with such a weak position and poor cards.",

Not desperate yet, but I should be careful.\n\n4. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 48 from the CO (button is seat 1, so seat 5 is CO)\n   - Looking at their recent actions, they seem relatively tight/passive\n   - They've mostly been calling or folding preflop\n   - They raised in hand #65 to 32 (3BB)\n   - They made a large flop bet of 80 in hand #67 after calling preflop\n   - They seem to play straightforwardly\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 40 to win 72, getting 1.8:1 odds\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I'm in decent shape with 28.8 BB. Defending SB with J8o against a raise from CO is generally a losing play, especially out of position.\n\nThe key factors:\n- Weak hand (J8o offsuit)\n- Out of position\n- Opponent appears tight/straightforward\n- Medium stack size means I don't need to gamble\n- Not getting great pot odds\n\nI should fold here. J8o is not strong enough to defend from SB against a raise, especially when I'll be out of position postflop. The opponent's raise to 3x suggests they have a real hand.

This is a decent hand, especially on the button.\n**Position**: BTN (button) - Best position post-flop\n**Stack**: 461 chips (28.8 BB) - Healthy stack\n**Blinds**: 8/16\n**Pot**: 24 chips\n**To call**: 16 chips\n\nOpponents:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 477 chips, in SB - Has been relatively passive, folding preflop often, calling when they enter\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 24 chips, in BB - Very short stack, just 1.5 BB. They raised in hand 74 and were aggressive post-flop\n\nKey observations:\n1. GPT-OSS-120B is extremely short stacked (24 chips = 1.5 BB). They're in the BB and have shown aggression previously (raised to 48 in hand 74, then bet 80 on flop and turn).\n2. MiniMax-M2 in SB has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 72, 73) but called in hand 74.\n3. I'm on the button with a decent hand.\n\nGiven GPT-OSS-120B's short stack, they're likely to shove or make a big move. They only have 24 chips left after posting the BB, so they can't make a normal raise - it would be an all-in.\n\nWith KTo on the button, I should:\n- Consider raising to isolate the short stack\n- The short stack might shove with a wide range\n- MiniMax has been passive and might fold to aggression\n\nSince GPT-OSS-120B only has 24 chips total and they've already put in 16, they have 8 chips left. If I raise, they would likely go all-in for their remaining 8 chips.\n\nLet me think about the math:\n- Pot is currently 24 (8 from SB + 16 from BB)\n- If I call 16, pot becomes 40\n- If I raise to 32 (minimum), and GPT-OSS-120B shoves for 8 more, pot would be 24+32+8 = 64, and I'd have to call 8 more (if MiniMax folds)\n\nActually, let me recalculate: GPT-OSS-120B has 24 chips total. They've posted 16 as BB, so they have 8 chips left. If I raise to 32, they can only call 8 more chips (all-in).\n\nI think raising is the right play here to:\n1. Isolate the short stack\n2. Put pressure on MiniMax who has been passive\n3. Build a pot with a decent hand in position\n\nGiven the stack sizes, a raise to about 40-48 seems appropriate. Let me raise to 48, which matches GPT-OSS-120B's previous raise size in hand 74.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. GPT-OSS-120B has only 8 chips left after posting BB. If I raise to 48:\n- They can only call 8 (all-in)\n- MiniMax would have to call 40 more\n- Pot would be 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 48 (my raise) + 8 (GPT all-in) = 80\n\nActually, I need to be more precise about the stack calculation. GPT-OSS-120B has 24 chips total. They posted 16 as BB, leaving them with 8 chips. So they can only put in 8 more chips maximum.\n\nIf I raise to 48:\n- MiniMax in SB has already put in 8, needs to call 40 more\n- GPT-OSS-120B in BB has put in 16, can only call 8 more (all-in)\n- I would be putting in 48 total\n\nThe pot would be: 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 48 (my raise) = 72, and then GPT-OSS-120B could add 8 more if they choose to call (all-in), making it 80 total.\n\nBut wait, if GPT-OSS-120B has 24 chips and posted 16, they have 8 left. They can call any raise by going all-in for their remaining 8.\n\nLet me think about whether I should just call or raise:\n- If I call 16: Pot is 40, we see flop 3-way, GPT-OSS-120B has 8 left\n- If I raise: I can isolate and build pot\n\nWith KTo on the button, this is definitely a raising hand given the situation. The short stack in BB is likely to go all-in with a wide range, and I'm ahead of their range. The SB has been passive.\n\nI'll raise to 48, which is 3x"

This is a decent hand, especially on the button.\n**Position**: BTN (button) - Best position post-flop\n**Stack**: 461 chips (28.8 BB) - Healthy stack\n**Blinds**: 8/16\n**Pot**: 24 chips\n**To call**: 16 chips\n\nOpponents:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 477 chips, in SB - Has been relatively passive, folding preflop often, calling when they enter\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 24 chips, in BB - Very short stack, just 1.5 BB. They raised in hand 74 and were aggressive post-flop\n\nKey observations:\n1. GPT-OSS-120B is extremely short stacked (24 chips = 1.5 BB). They're in the BB and have shown aggression previously (raised to 48 in hand 74, then bet 80 on flop and turn).\n2. MiniMax-M2 in SB has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 72, 73) but called in hand 74.\n3. I'm on the button with a decent hand.\n\nGiven GPT-OSS-120B's short stack, they're likely to shove or make a big move. They only have 24 chips left after posting the BB, so they can't make a normal raise - it would be an all-in.\n\nWith KTo on the button, I should:\n- Consider raising to isolate the short stack\n- The short stack might shove with a wide range\n- MiniMax has been passive and might fold to aggression\n\nSince GPT-OSS-120B only has 24 chips total and they've already put in 16, they have 8 chips left. If I raise, they would likely go all-in for their remaining 8 chips.\n\nLet me think about the math:\n- Pot is currently 24 (8 from SB + 16 from BB)\n- If I call 16, pot becomes 40\n- If I raise to 32 (minimum), and GPT-OSS-120B shoves for 8 more, pot would be 24+32+8 = 64, and I'd have to call 8 more (if MiniMax folds)\n\nActually, let me recalculate: GPT-OSS-120B has 24 chips total. They've posted 16 as BB, so they have 8 chips left. If I raise to 32, they can only call 8 more chips (all-in).\n\nI think raising is the right play here to:\n1. Isolate the short stack\n2. Put pressure on MiniMax who has been passive\n3. Build a pot with a decent hand in position\n\nGiven the stack sizes, a raise to about 40-48 seems appropriate. Let me raise to 48, which matches GPT-OSS-120B's previous raise size in hand 74.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. GPT-OSS-120B has only 8 chips left after posting BB. If I raise to 48:\n- They can only call 8 (all-in)\n- MiniMax would have to call 40 more\n- Pot would be 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 48 (my raise) + 8 (GPT all-in) = 80\n\nActually, I need to be more precise about the stack calculation. GPT-OSS-120B has 24 chips total. They posted 16 as BB, leaving them with 8 chips. So they can only put in 8 more chips maximum.\n\nIf I raise to 48:\n- MiniMax in SB has already put in 8, needs to call 40 more\n- GPT-OSS-120B in BB has put in 16, can only call 8 more (all-in)\n- I would be putting in 48 total\n\nThe pot would be: 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 48 (my raise) = 72, and then GPT-OSS-120B could add 8 more if they choose to call (all-in), making it 80 total.\n\nBut wait, if GPT-OSS-120B has 24 chips and posted 16, they have 8 left. They can call any raise by going all-in for their remaining 8.\n\nLet me think about whether I should just call or raise:\n- If I call 16: Pot is 40, we see flop 3-way, GPT-OSS-120B has 8 left\n- If I raise: I can isolate and build pot\n\nWith KTo on the button, this is definitely a raising hand given the situation. The short stack in BB is likely to go all-in with a wide range, and I'm ahead of their range. The SB has been passive.\n\nI'll raise to 48, which is 3x",

It's offsuit, not connected, and my King is decent but the 7 kicker is weak. In the BB facing a limp from the SB, I have:\n- Position: I'm out of position postflop (BB)\n- Hand strength: Weak - at best I might have a King-high hand\n- Pot odds: I'm getting a free check (no more to call)\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check. Here's why:\n1. My hand is too weak to raise with, especially out of position\n2. MiniMax-M2 is tight but passive - if I raise, they might fold their weaker hands but call with better ones\n3. I have no information about what they limped with - could be anything from weak suited connectors to small pairs to trap hands\n4. I preserve my stack and see a flop for free with a marginal hand\n5. The pot is small (32 chips) and not worth fighting for with K7o OOP\n\nChecking is the standard, optimal play here.",

Even if my King is good now, any Ace, Jack, or pair beats me.

They called 8 more (so 16 total) and I checked. Pot is 48.\n- Flop: I checked, they bet 16 (1/3 pot)\n\nThis is a small bet. They could be:\n1. C-betting with air\n2. Betting a weak pair\n3. Betting a strong hand like Ax, Jx, or a set\n\n**Pot odds**: 16 to win 48 = 3:1 = 25% equity needed\n\n**My equity**: With K-high, I likely have around 15-20% equity against a typical betting range here. I need to hit a King or runner-runner straight.\n\n**Position**: I'm out of position, which is bad. If I call, I'll have to act first on future streets.\n\n**Stack sizes**: I have 30 BB, which is healthy. Calling 16 chips won't hurt my stack much.\n\n**Decision**: This is a marginal spot. I have some showdown value with my King high, and the opponent's bet is small. However:\n- I'm out of position\n- I only have K-high\n- The board hits many hands\n\n\nI'll fold this hand. The small pot odds don't justify continuing with just King-high against a likely stronger range.

It's definitely playable from the button.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position in poker. I get to act last postflop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 477 chips (29.8 BB) - This is a healthy stack, not short-stacked.\n\n4. **Current situation**: \n   - Pot is 24 chips (8 from small blind + 16 from big blind)\n   - I need to call 8 to see the flop\n   - Minimum raise is to 32\n\n5. **Opponent info**: MiniMax-M2 is the only active player in the big blind. From the hand history:\n   - They folded preflop in hands 73 and 75\n   - They called preflop in hands 74 and 76\n   - In hand 74, they called down multiple streets (flop, turn, river) with checks\n   - In hand 76, they bet on the flop after calling preflop\n\n   This suggests MiniMax-M2 is somewhat passive but capable of betting when they have something. They seem to defend their blind sometimes but not aggressively.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 29.8 BB, I have room to play, but I should be careful not to get into trouble with marginal hands.\n\nWith Ace-Jack suited on the button, this is a clear raising hand. I want to:\n- Build the pot with a strong hand\n- Take control of the hand\n- Isolate against the big blind\n- Potentially win the pot preflop\n\nA standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 48 chips, or about 2.5x-3x the BB is typical. Since the minimum is 32, I could raise to something like 48-56 chips.\n\nLet me raise to 48 (3x BB) which is a standard sizing.",

It's:\n- Not suited\n- Low cards\n- 2-gap (5-6-7) - barely connected\n- Typically a fold in most situations\n\n**Position advantage:**\nI'm on the Button, which is great position postflop, but I only have one opponent (BB) since SB folded. With 75bb effective stacks, position matters but hand strength is still paramount preflop.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nMiniMax-M2 in BB (Seat 4):\nFrom the recall data:\n- Very tight player - folds a lot preflop (hands 69, 70, 72, 73, 75, 77, 78)\n- When they do play, they tend to be passive (lots of checking)\n- In hand 74: called preflop, then called flop and turn bets\n- In hand 76: called preflop, then made a small flop bet\n- Overall: tight-passive player\n\n**Pot odds:**\nI need to call 8 to win 24, getting 3:1 odds. This is attractive, but with a hand this weak, even good pot odds don't justify calling.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy 31.3 BB stack\n- No need to get involved with marginal hands\n- Better spots will come\n- Even against a tight BB, 75o is just too weak to play profitably\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: The standard play. Hand is too weak.\n2. **Call**: Could complete with good pot odds, but hand is very weak and I'll be out of position postflop (wait, I'm actually IN position on the button). Still not recommended.\n3. **Raise**: Could steal from the tight BB. Min-raise to 32 would be a steal attempt. With 31.3 BB, I can afford this.\n\n**Steal consideration:**\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 is tight and folds a lot preflop, a raise could be profitable as a steal. However:\n\n\nA cautious approach is more sensible. The risks of raising with such a weak hand outweigh the potential benefits. Despite the opponent's tight play, the hand's fundamental weakness makes it a clear fold. I'll preserve my chips for a better opportunity, maintaining a disciplined strategy that protects my stack and waits for more favorable situations.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me think about this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the Button with Jh 4h\n- I have 493 chips (15.4 BB)\n- Blinds are 16/32\n- MiniMax-M2 is in the Big Blind with 437 chips\n- Everyone else has folded\n- I need to call 16 to see the flop (half the big blind since I posted small blind)\n\n**My cards:** Jh 4h - This is a suited connector but very weak. J4 suited is not a great hand, even on the button.\n\n**Opponent analysis:** Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Hand 80: Preflop fold\n- Hand 78: Preflop fold  \n- Hand 77: Preflop fold\n- Hand 76: Called 8, then bet 16 on flop\n- Hand 75: Preflop fold\n- Hand 74: Called 80 on flop, checked turn, called 80 on turn, checked river\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems to be playing relatively tight, folding preflop frequently. When they do play, they seem to call rather than raise aggressively.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button, which is the best position post-flop. This gives me an advantage.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 15.4 BB, which is getting short but not desperate yet. MiniMax has 13.7 BB.\n\n**Pot odds:** The pot is 48 chips and I need to call 16, so I'm getting 3:1 odds. However, with J4s, I'm rarely going to have a strong hand even if I hit.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. My hand is very weak (J4s)\n2. I'm on the button (good position)\n3. Opponent seems tight\n4. I have a medium-short stack (15.4 BB)\n5. Getting 3:1 pot odds\n\n**Analysis:** \nWith J4s, I could hit a flush draw, straight draw, or make a pair of Jacks. However:\n- If I hit a Jack, I'll have second pair with a weak kicker\n- The flush potential is there but it's a low flush (4-high)\n- I could make a straight with 3-5-6-7 or 5-6-7-8, but that's unlikely\n\nGiven my medium-short stack and the weak hand, I should be looking for better spots. Even though I have position and decent pot odds, J4s is just too weak to play here. \n\nThe risk/reward isn't great - if I call and miss the flop (which will happen most of the time), I'll have invested 16 chips into a pot where I'll likely have to fold to any aggression. If I hit something marginal, I could lose more chips.\n\nI should fold and preserve my stack for a better opportunity.",

Position: Button is good, but not enough to compensate for such a weak hand\n3. Stack size: 15.4 BB is somewhat short, I should be preserving my chips for better spots\n4. Pot odds: I need to call 16 to win 48, so 3:1 odds. Even with these odds, 5-3 offsuit is just too weak\n5. Tournament considerations: With 15.4 BB, I'm in the \"danger zone\" but not yet desperate. I should wait for better hands or spots to shove\n\nI don't need to use memory tools here - this is a straightforward decision based on basic poker fundamentals. 5-3 offsuit is a fold in virtually all situations, especially with a short stack.\n\nThe action should be: fold",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this preflop situation:\n\n**My Hand:** Qs 9c - This is a moderately weak hand. Q9 offsuit is not a premium hand and should typically be folded in most positions, especially early positions. However, I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position postflop.\n\n**Stack Size:** I have 493 chips which is 15.4 BB. This is a short stack situation where I need to be careful but also look for spots to accumulate chips.\n\n**Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 in the BB with 437 chips (13.7 BB). Looking at their recent history:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 72, 73, 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84)\n- When they do play (hand 74), they called preflop and then called bets on flop and turn, showing a tendency to call down with marginal hands\n- They seem relatively passive, checking frequently and folding often\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 16 to win a pot of 48, which is 3:1 odds. That's attractive odds, but with Q9o I need to consider:\n\n1. **Hand Strength:** Q9o is a marginal hand. It's dominated by many hands that the BB could have (AQ, KQ, QJ, QT). \n2. **Position:** I'm on the Button, which is excellent position. If I call, I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Stack Sizes:** Both stacks are short. If I call and hit something, I could potentially get the BB's entire stack.\n4. **Opponent Tendency:** MiniMax-M2 folds a lot preflop but seems to call down when they do play. This means if I hit top pair, I might get value.\n\n**Decision:** With 15.4 BB, I should generally be playing a tight range. Q9o is below the threshold for a standard open-raise, and as a call from the SB, it's marginal. However, given:\n- I'm getting 3:1 pot odds\n- I have position\n- The opponent is passive and folds often\n- My stack is short enough that I could potentially get their whole stack if I hit\n\nI think this is a borderline call. However, Q9o is really not a strong hand. The fact that it's offsuit reduces its playability significantly. I think the correct play here is to fold and preserve my stack for a better spot, especially since I need to be careful with only 15.4 BB in a tournament.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 15.4 BB, I'm in the \"push/fold\" territory for many hands, but Q9o is not strong enough to shove with. The call is only 16 chips (0.5 BB), so it's a small investment. Given my position and the opponent's passivity, I could call and see a flop. If I hit top pair or better, I could potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold.\n\nThe pot odds are good (3:1), position is excellent, and the investment is small relative to my stack. I think calling is defensible here. However, Q9o offsuit is quite weak...\n\nLet me think about tournament equity. With 15.4 BB, I should be looking for spots to either shove or fold. Calling with marginal hands can lead to difficult postflop decisions that could cost me more chips. The safer play is to fold and wait for a better hand or a better spot (like shoving with a stronger hand).\n\nI think folding is the more disciplined play here. Q9o is just too weak, and while the pot odds are good, I don't want to get involved with a marginal hand when I'm short-stacked.",

I should raise for value and to isolate. Since there's only one opponent and I have position, I want to:\n\n1. Build the pot with my strong hand\n2. Isolate against one opponent\n3.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- I'm on the BTN with 4d 2d (unsuited, very weak hand)\n- Stack: 509 chips (15.9 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- To call: 16 chips (I'm the SB)\n\n**Opponent:**\n- MiniMax-M2 in BB with 421 chips\n- This is heads up (BTN vs BB)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n4d 2d is a very weak hand. Even though they're suited, the ranks are extremely low. This hand has very little equity against any reasonable range.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm on the BTN which is good position, but with a very weak hand.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nLooking at the search results for MiniMax-M2:\n- Hand 73: Folded BB\n- Hand 74: Called from SB, then check-called flop and turn, folded on river (showed passivity)\n- Hand 75: Folded to BTN raise\n- Hand 76: Called from BB, bet flop when checked to\n- Hand 77: Folded to BTN raise\n- Hand 78: Folded BB\n- Hand 80: Folded BB\n- Hand 82: Folded BB\n- Hand 84: Folded BB\n- Hand 86: Called from BB, then folded to raise\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 frequently folds from BB (hands 73, 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84) but sometimes calls and then folds to aggression (hand 86). They seem to defend BB somewhat but are generally passive and fold to pressure.\n\n**Stack Size Considerations:**\nI have 15.9 BB - this is a short stack but not desperate yet. I need to be selective with my hands. With 4-2 offsuit, this is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nI need to call 16 to win 48 (3:1 pot odds). While this might seem tempting, 4-2 offsuit has very poor equity against any hand. Even against a random hand, 4-2 offsuit only has about 35% equity.\n\n**ICM/Tournament Considerations:**\nWith 15.9 BB, I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips, but this is not a good spot. I should wait for a better hand or a better situation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a clear fold. 4-2 offsuit is one of the worst hands in poker, and even though I'm getting 3:1 pot odds and have position, it's not worth investing chips with such a weak holding when I have a short stack. I should preserve my chips for a better spot.",

Even if I hit a 7 or 9, I'll likely be dominated. The only real hope is a straight draw, but that's unlikely.\n\nWith a tight opponent who limped, they likely have something like small pocket pair, Ax, or two face cards. My 7-9 offsuit is likely crushed.\n\nThe smart tournament play is to fold this garbage hand and preserve chips. Even though it's free to see the flop, playing out of position with a weak hand against a tight player is -EV.\n\nHowever, wait - I should reconsider. It's actually FREE to see the flop (amount to call is 0). Checking costs me nothing. Even with a weak hand, seeing a free flop in the BB is standard. If I completely miss, I can easily fold to any bet. If I somehow get lucky and flop two pair or a straight, I might extract value from the opponent.\n\nThe correct play is to check and see the free flop. Folding when you can check for free is too tight.",

This is a terrible hand on this board. The board has three clubs including an Ace, which is very dangerous.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall, MiniMax-M2 has:\n- Folded preflop many times (hands 72, 73, 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84)\n- Called preflop occasionally (hands 74, 76, 86)\n- In hand 74: Called flop and turn bets, suggesting they can call with marginal hands\n- In hand 76: Made a small flop bet\n- Generally seems somewhat passive but willing to call\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Preflop: SB posted 16, I posted BB 32, SB called 16 more (making it 32 total), I checked\n- So preflop action suggests SB might have a marginal hand that wanted to see a cheap flop\n- Now on the flop, it's checked to me and I can check or bet\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a terrible board for my hand. I have:\n- No pair\n- No draw (not even a gutshot)\n- The board is very coordinated with a flush draw\n\nI should check here. Betting would be pure bluff, and given the coordinated board and that my opponent called preflop, they likely have something. Even if they missed, they might call with any Ax, any club, any pair, or any straight draw.\n\nChecking is the clear best option. I have no equity and no reason to bet.",

They could have:\n- A weak ace\n- A draw\n- Complete air\n- A medium pocket pair\n\nMy hand: I have an open-ended straight draw (need 3 or 8, but 3 is less likely to be good). Actually wait, let me recount: 4-5-6-7 - I need an 8 to make the straight. So I have 4 outs to a straight (four 8s in the deck).\n \nI'm facing a potential flush threat with three clubs on the board. My 7c might actually be a disadvantage if the opponent is drawing for a flush. The pot is relatively small at 64 chips, and my stack is healthy at 14.9 big blinds. \n\nI need to carefully consider my options. Checking could allow me to see the river for free, but it also risks giving the opponent a chance to improve their hand. A small bet might provide some information about their hand strength while keeping the pot manageable.\n\nThe opponent's previous betting patterns suggest they're cautious, so a strategic check or a minimal bet could be the most prudent approach. I want to avoid overcommitting to a draw that might not be as strong as it initially appears.\n\nThe 8 of clubs is particularly problematic, as it would simultaneously complete potential flush draws. While my straight draw seems promising, the board's texture introduces significant complications. With multiple potential draws and a conservative opponent, checking seems the most prudent strategy. This allows me to preserve my stack and see the river without unnecessary risk.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight playing style and the board's potential dangers, a cautious approach minimizes potential losses while maintaining future strategic flexibility.\n\nChecking here aligns with several key poker principles: pot control, risk management, and allowing the opponent to potentially reveal hand strength on the river.",

The opponent has shown no aggression at all and has been checking back. They could have:\n- A weak pair\n- Ace with weak kicker\n- Some draw that missed\n- Complete air\n\nSince I have nothing and they've shown no aggression, checking is the clear play. There's no value in betting - they would only call with better hands. I might have the best hand (if they have complete air), but I can't get value from worse hands or make better hands fold.\n\nI should check and hope my 7 high is good, or that we both have nothing and I win with the best high card.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 14.9 BB, which is getting short but not desperate\n- No need to risk chips with complete air\n- Preserve stack for better spots\n\nThe decision is clear: CHECK",

However, we need to be careful - a min-raise to 64 commits about 14% of our stack. \n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 14.4 BB, we should be thinking about either:\n- Folding marginal hands\n- Raising to steal\n- Shoving strong hands\n\nJTo from the button is good enough to raise as a steal attempt against a tight BB. A standard raise to 64 (2x BB) should be sufficient. If we get called, we have position and can evaluate the flop.\n\nAlternatively, we could just call and see a flop cheaply, preserving our stack for a better spot.\n\nLet me think about the EV:\n- If we raise to 64 and BB folds (likely given tightness), we win 48 chips\n- If we raise to 64 and BB calls, we have position\n\nI think raising is slightly better than calling here. It gives us fold equity and we don't commit too much of our stack.",

AJ offsuit is definitely a raising hand from the button.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position in poker. I get to act last on every street.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 509 chips (15.9 BB). This is a medium stack - not desperate but not deep either.\n\n4. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 is in the big blind with 421 chips (about 13.2 BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They fold preflop frequently (hands 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84, 89, 90)\n   - They sometimes call (hands 76, 86, 88) \n   - When they do see flops, they tend to play passively (check-calling in hand 74, checking in hand 88)\n   - They seem to be a relatively tight/passive player\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: The pot is 48 chips, I need to call 16 to see the flop. That's 3:1 pot odds, which is great for a hand like AJ.\n\n6. **Action**: It's just me (SB) and MiniMax-M2 (BB). The action is on me to complete the small blind.\n\n**Decision**: With AJ on the button against a tight/passive opponent, this is a clear raise. I want to:\n- Build the pot with my strong hand\n- Take control of the hand\n- Put pressure on the BB\n- Potentially win the pot preflop\n\nGiven my stack size (15.9 BB), I should raise to about 2.5-3x the BB. The minimum raise is 64 (2x BB), but that's a bit small. A standard raise would be 80-96 chips (2.5x-3x BB).\n\nLet me raise to 80 chips (2.5x BB). This is a solid sizing that:\n- Puts pressure on the BB\n- Doesn't commit too much of my stack\n- Gives me room to fold if the BB shoves and I don't feel good about it\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the opponent's pattern, they fold to preflop pressure quite often. A raise to 80 (2.5x) should be sufficient.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: 9d 5h - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and with a large gap. It's not a profitable hand to play in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. However, this is preflop action.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 557 chips (17.4 BB), which is getting short-stacked in tournament terms. I need to be careful with my chips.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - I posted the small blind (16 chips)\n   - MiniMax-M2 posted the big blind (32 chips)\n   - I need to call 16 more chips to see the flop\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n   - They have been folding a lot preflop (hands 89, 90, 91, 92)\n   - When they do play, they tend to be passive (calling then checking down)\n   - Their showdown history shows they've played some weak hands (53, 5c3s, JdQd)\n   - They seem to be a somewhat loose-passive player\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 48 chips and I need to call 16 chips, giving me 3:1 pot odds. This means I need ~25% equity to break even.\n\n7. **Hand equity**: 9-5 offsuit has very poor equity against any reasonable calling range. Even against a random hand, it only has about 40% equity, and against a typical BB defending range, it's much worse (likely 30% or less).\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: With 17.4 BB, I'm in the danger zone but not desperate yet. I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips, but this is not a good spot. 9-5 offsuit is a clear fold in most situations, especially when I'm not extremely short-stacked.\n\n9. **Position advantage**: While I have position post-flop, the hand is just too weak to justify calling. Even if I hit a 9 or 5, I'll often be dominated by better kickers.\n\nThe only argument for calling is that MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot, so I might be able to steal the pot post-flop. But with such a weak hand, this is a low-percentage play that risks valuable tournament chips.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. The hand is too weak, my stack is still healthy enough to wait for better spots, and the risk/reward isn't favorable.",

Here's why:\n1. My hand Q3o is extremely weak - one of the worst hands in poker\n2. MiniMax-M2 is tight and only called the SB completion, suggesting they might have something\n3. Raising would be spewing chips with a trash hand against a tight player\n4. I can see a free flop from the BB\n5. Even though I'm out of position postflop, the pot is small and checking costs nothing\n\n\n6. My stack is too valuable to waste on Q3o\n\nI'll conserve my chips and check, preserving my stack for a better opportunity.

          "reasoning_content": "  I have 3h Qs, giving me two pair (Jacks and Queens) on a board of Js Jh 7h. However, there are two hearts on the board (Jh and 7h), so a flush draw is possible.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n1. My hand: Qs 3h - I have two pair (Jacks and Queens) but my kicker is weak (3h)\n2. Position: BB, acting first on the flop\n3. Stack: 525 chips (16.4 BB) - decent stack\n4. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in SB with 389 chips\n5. Board: Js Jh 7h - paired board with flush draw\n6. Pot: 64 chips\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They tend to fold preflop a lot (folded in hands 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84, 89, 90, 91, 92)\n- When they do play, they can call (hands 74, 76, 86, 88)\n- In hand 76, they bet on the flop\n- In hand 74, they called on the turn and checked on the river\n- In hand 88, they checked through flop, turn, and river\n\nThe pattern suggests MiniMax-M2 is relatively tight/passive. They fold a lot preflop and when they do see flops, they don't always bet aggressively.\n\nOn this flop:\n- I have two pair but the board is paired (Jacks), which means anyone with a Jack has trips\n- There are two hearts, so a flush draw is possible\n- My kicker (3h) is very weak\n- I'm out of position\n\nGiven that the board is paired and there's a flush draw, and my kicker is weak, I should be cautious. However, I likely have the best hand right now against a tight player who just called preflop from SB.\n\nI should bet for value and protection against the flush draw. A bet of around 1/2 to 2/3 pot seems appropriate.\nPot is 64, so a bet of 32-42 chips would be good.\n \nI'll carefully consider my options. Checking could be a strategic move against an aggressive opponent, but MiniMax-M2's passive style suggests a value bet might work better. I'll make a calculated bet of 32 chips - a solid value bet that protects my hand and extracts value from weaker holdings. This sizing allows me to control the pot while maintaining pressure on my opponent.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - great position\n- Cards: Qc 5c (Queen of clubs, 5 of clubs) - suited but not connected, relatively weak hand\n- Stack: 573 chips (17.9 BB) - slightly below 20BB, getting short\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48\n- To call: 16 (completing from SB to BB)\n- Min raise: 64\n\n**Opponent Analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Very tight player - mostly folding preflop (16/20 actions were folds)\n- Only calls with strong hands (called 4 times, folded 3 of those on flop)\n- Never raises preflop (0 raises found)\n- When they do call, they often fold on the flop (e.g., hand 86 and 94)\n- Passive post-flop play (checking rather than betting)\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Q5s is marginal. It's suited but not connected, and Q-high is weak.\n2. **Position**: Button is great, but we're facing a single opponent in the BB.\n3. **Stack Size**: 17.9BB is getting short. We need to be selective and look for spots to accumulate chips.\n4. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 is very tight/passive. They fold a lot preflop and play weak post-flop.\n5. **Pot Odds**: Calling 16 to win 48 = 3:1 odds. Not terrible, but we need to hit something.\n6. **Tournament**: Need to preserve stack but also look for spots to chip up against weak players.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Safest option. Q5s is weak, and we don't want to bleed chips.\n- **Call**: Cheap at 16 chips, but we're out of position post-flop (we're actually in position as BTN vs BB). We have 3:1 pot odds.\n- **Raise**: Min raise is 64 (2BB). Given opponent folds a lot preflop, this could be a good steal attempt.\n\n**Recommendation**: \nGiven that MiniMax-M2 is extremely tight (folds 80% preflop) and never raises preflop, a steal raise from the button seems profitable. However, with Q5s and 17.9BB, we should be careful about risking too many chips.\n\nActually, wait - I'm on the Button posting the SB, and MiniMax-M2 is in the BB. So I have position post-flop. The opponent is very tight and folds a lot. A raise here is a good steal attempt, but Q5s is really weak.\n\nLet me reconsider: With 17.9BB, I should be more conservative. While a raise could steal the blinds, if called I'm in trouble with Q5s. The opponent calls about 20% of the time, and when they do, they have something decent.\n\nI think the best play is to **fold**. Q5s is just too weak to play even against a tight opponent with a shortish stack. I should save my chips for a better spot.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. It's only 16 more chips (0.5BB) to call, I'm on the button, and the opponent is very tight/passive. The pot odds are good (3:1), and I have position. Maybe calling is okay to see a flop.\n\nBut with 17.9BB, I should be thinking about push/fold in many spots. Q5s is not a hand I want to play post-flop OOP... wait, I AM in position (Button vs BB).\n\nHmm, I'm conflicted:\n- Fold: Safest, preserves chips\n- Call: Cheap, good position, 3:1 odds\n- Raise: Good steal attempt vs tight opponent\n\nGiven the opponent's extreme tightness (80% preflop folds) and passivity, I think a **raise to 64** is actually the best play. It's a standard button steal against a tight BB. If they call, I can evaluate the flop, but they'll likely fold.\n\nWait, but with Q5s and 17.9BB, maybe that's too aggressive. Let me think tournament strategy: At <20BB, I should be more selective. But stealing blinds is crucial.\n\nI think I'll go with a **fold**. Q5s is just too weak, and while the opponent is tight, I don't want to risk 64 chips (3.5% of my stack) on a marginal steal with a weak hand. I'll wait for a better spot.",

Let me look at their tendencies from the data I retrieved:\n\nFrom the opponent actions:\n- They fold a lot preflop (many folds)\n- When they do call, they sometimes fold on later streets (hand 94: called preflop, folded flop)\n- They don't seem to be very aggressive based on the limited aggressive actions shown\n\n**My analysis:**\n1. **My hand is complete garbage** - I have 6-high on a board with multiple cards that could easily make pairs, straights, etc.\n2. **I've been betting as if I have something** - I bet flop and turn, representing strength\n3. **Opponent has called twice** - This suggests they have something, even if it's marginal\n4. **I cannot win at showdown** - My 6-high will never win against any pair or even Ace-high\n5. **Checking is the only sensible option** - I need to see if they'll check back and give me a free showdown, or if they'll bet and I can fold\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I'm short-stacked with 9.2 BB\n- The pot is already large (554 chips)\n- I cannot afford to bluff off more chips with complete air\n- I need to preserve my stack for better spots\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI should check and hope the opponent checks back. If they bet, I must fold. Raising would be suicidal with 6-high - I have no equity and would just be throwing away chips. This is a clear check/fold spot.\n\nThe opponent has shown they can call bets, so they likely have some piece of the board. I need to minimize my losses here.",

My hand has almost no equity, the opponent is short-stacked and likely to call with any pair or decent hand, and the risk/reward of bluffing isn't favorable. I have a healthy stack and don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n\nI'll maintain my chip stack by taking a cautious approach, recognizing the unfavorable board texture and opponent's potential range.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the Button with 44\n- Board: 7s 7c Qd 2c Qh (paired board with QQ77)\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- My stack: 818 chips (25.6 BB)\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 with 96 chips (3 BB)\n- Action: MiniMax-M2 checked on the river\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have pocket 4s. The board is QQ772 with no flush possible. My hand is 44 on a QQ772 board.\n\nPossible hands MiniMax-M2 could have:\n- Any Queen (beats me): Qx hands like QK, QJ, QT, Q9, Q8, Q7, Q6, Q5, Q4, Q3, Q2\n- Any 7 (beats me): 7x hands\n- Any pocket pair 55-66, 88-JJ (beats me)\n- Pocket 22 (beats me with a full house)\n- Pocket 44 (chops with me)\n- Pocket 33, 55-66 (loses to me)\n- Ace high, King high, etc. (I beat these)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall, MiniMax-M2 has been:\n- Folding preflop frequently (hands 78, 80, 82, 84, 89, 90, 91, 92)\n- Calling preflop occasionally (hands 86, 88, 94, 96)\n- In hand 88: Called preflop, then check-check-check (showdown not shown, but likely weak)\n- In hand 94: Called preflop, folded on flop\n- In hand 96: Called preflop, called flop (32), called turn (213), checked river - this was a big pot\n\nThe opponent is short-stacked with only 96 chips (3 BB). They've checked to me on the river.\n\n**My hand strength:** With 44 on a QQ772 board, I have two pair, fours and queens (sevens on board). But any Queen, any 7, any pocket pair 55+, or 22 beats me. Given the action (check-check-check-check), it's possible my opponent has:\n- A weak queen that they're scared to bet\n- A missed draw\n- A small pocket pair worse than mine\n- Complete air\n\n**Pot odds:** The pot is 64 chips. If I bet, I need to consider that my opponent only has 96 chips total, so the maximum I can win is 64 + 96 = 160 chips if they call/shove.\n\n**Decision:** With a short-stacked opponent who has shown weakness by checking, and given that I have a decent but vulnerable hand, I should consider a value bet. However, my hand is quite weak on this board texture - many hands beat me.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The board is QQ772. I have 44. What hands would MiniMax-M2:\n1. Call preflop with from BB?\n2. Check flop, turn, and river with?\n\nPossible hands:\n- Qx hands: Would likely bet for value on river\n- 7x hands: Would likely bet for value on river\n- Pocket pairs 55-JJ: Might check down if they think I'm bluffing\n- Pocket 33: Might check down\n- Ace high: Might check down\n- King high: Might check down\n\nGiven that they checked the river, they likely don't have a strong hand like a Queen or 7. They could have a pocket pair 55-JJ, or they could have complete air.\n\nBut wait - if they have 55-JJ, they beat me! So I'm actually in a bad spot. I'm only beating:\n- 33\n- Ace high\n- King high\n- Other air\n\nAnd I'm losing to:\n- Any Queen\n- Any 7\n- 22 (full house)\n- Any pocket pair 55-JJ\n\nGiven this analysis, my hand is actually quite weak. I should check back and try to get to showdown cheaply. There's no value in betting because:\n1. Better hands will call (any pocket pair 55+)\n2. Worse hands will fold (Ace high, King high)\n3. I'm only getting called by better hands\n\nThe only reason to bet would be as a thin value bet if I think they'll call with Ace-high or King-high, but that's too optimistic.\n\n**Conclusion:** I should check back and see if my 44 is good at showdown. This is a clear check situation.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Based on MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n\n1. They fold preflop most of the time (80% fold rate)\n2. When they do play, they're generally passive (checking, calling)\n3. In Hand #96, they called large bets on turn and river but still checked at showdown\n4. They haven't shown any aggressive betting patterns\n\nGiven this information, MiniMax-M2 is likely a very tight, passive player who rarely bluffs and only plays strong hands.\n\nOn this board (QQ772), my 44 is very weak. The only hands I'm beating are pure bluffs or hands like 33, A-high, K-high, etc. Given MiniMax-M2's tight/passive nature, if they had any pair (55+, 22), any Queen, or any 7, they would likely have bet by now, especially on the river. The fact that they've checked all the way suggests they either have complete air or a very marginal hand.\n\nHowever, given their tight nature, I should be cautious. They might have been slow-playing a monster like Qx or 77, but that seems unlikely given their passive pattern. They might also have a small pocket pair (55-66, 88-JJ) that's scared of the Queens.\n\nWith the pot at 64 chips and MiniMax-M2 having 96 chips total, I could try a small value bet. But I don't have much showdown value with 44. A bluff might work, but it's risky against a tight player who might call with any pair.\n\nI think the best play is to check and hope to win at showdown. If they have air, I'll win. If they have a marginal hand, they might call a bet anyway. Checking is the safest option.",

MiniMax-M2 in the BB is short-stacked (3.5 BB) and could easily shove, forcing me to fold after investing chips. With a healthy 25.6 BB stack, I should preserve my chips for better spots rather than gamble with a dominated hand.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  I'm in the BTN position with 2c Ts. Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 2c Ts is a very weak hand. It's an offsuit hand with a low card (2) and a mid card (T). This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is the best position post-flop, but this doesn't compensate for the terrible hand strength.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 818 chips (25.6 BB), which is a healthy stack. I shouldn't risk chips with a weak hand.\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**: MiniMax-M2 is in the BB with 112 chips (3.5 BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They fold preflop frequently (hands 86, 89, 90, 91, 92, 98)\n   - When they do play, they tend to be passive (lots of checking, calling small bets)\n   - They called a 213 chip bet on the turn in hand 96, suggesting they can have decent hands\n   - Overall, they seem tight-passive\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 chips to win a pot of 48 chips. That's 3:1 pot odds, which might seem tempting, but with 2c Ts, I'm very likely dominated even if I hit something.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With a 25.6 BB stack, I'm in decent shape. I don't need to take marginal spots. Folding weak hands from the BTN is fine, especially when the BB is short-stacked and might shove.\n\n7. **The BB's stack**: MiniMax-M2 only has 112 chips (3.5 BB). If I call, they could easily shove all-in, and I'd have to fold anyway, losing the 16 chips.\n\nThe only argument for playing this hand would be if the BB is extremely tight and folds to steals often. But looking at their history, while they do fold a lot, they also call sometimes. And with their short stack, they're more likely to defend or shove.\n\nGiven the terrible hand strength, my decent stack size, and the risk of the short-stacked BB shoving, this is a clear fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in BB with Js Jd (pocket jacks)\n- My stack: 786 chips (24.6 BB)\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 96 chips\n- Only opponent: MiniMax-M2 in SB with 96 chips\n- Action: MiniMax-M2 posted SB (16), I posted BB (32), then MiniMax-M2 raised to 64\n\n**Amount to call:** 32 (the raise is 64 total, I already have 32 in)\n**Minimum raise to:** 96\n**Legal actions:** fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the search results, I see MiniMax-M2's patterns:\n- Hand 86: Called from SB, then folded to my raise\n- Hand 88: Called from SB, played passively postflop\n- Hand 89: Folded to my BTN raise\n- Hand 90: Folded SB\n- Hand 91: Folded to my BTN raise\n- Hand 92: Folded SB\n- Hand 94: Called from SB, folded to flop bet\n- Hand 96: Called from SB, called flop, called turn (this was a big pot where I won)\n- Hand 97: Checked from BB (when I was BTN)\n- Hand 98: Folded SB\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 is generally passive, often folding to aggression. They sometimes call preflop but fold to continuation bets. In hand 96 they called down with Td Kh but lost.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Pocket jacks are a strong hand, especially heads-up\n- I'm out of position (BB vs SB)\n- MiniMax-M2 has only 96 chips total (3 BB), so they're short-stacked\n- Their raise to 64 is a min-raise (2x the BB)\n- The pot is 96 chips and I need to call 32, giving me 3:1 pot odds\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: JJ is a premium hand, especially against a short stack\n2. **Position**: Bad position (BB), but with JJ and a short stack opponent, this matters less\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: MiniMax-M2 is passive and often folds to pressure. Their min-raise could be weak\n4. **Stack sizes**: If I raise, I could put them all-in. They have 96 total, already put in 64, so they have 32 left\n5. **Pot odds**: Getting 3:1 to call, which is great for JJ\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Terrible with JJ against a short stack\n- **Call**: Could see a flop, but I'm out of position and they'd have only 32 left\n- **Raise**: Best option. I can raise to 96 (which puts them all-in) or just raise to isolate\n\nIf I raise to 96, they're getting pot odds of:\n- Pot would be: 96 (current) + 32 (my additional) = 128\n- They need to call: 32\n- Pot odds: 4:1\n\nWith any decent hand, they might call. And with JJ, I want to get value and deny equity.\n\nActually, let me recalculate: If I raise to 96 total:\n- I've already put in 32\n- I need to add 64 more\n- They have 96 total, already put in 64\n- They need to call 32 more to match 96\n\nWait, the minimum raise is 96 TOTAL (not additional). So:\n- Current pot: 96 (16+32+48 raise)\n- To raise to 96 means I'm putting in 96 total\n- I've already put in 32\n- So I need to add 64 more\n- MiniMax-M2 has put in 64 total so far\n- If I raise to 96, they would need to call 32 more (96-64=32)\n- They have exactly 32 left in their stack (96 total - 64 already in = 32)\n\nSo raising to 96 puts them all-in!\n\nThis is perfect. With JJ against a short stack who is passive, I should definitely raise to put them all-in. This is a standard play.\n\nThe reasoning: JJ is a strong hand that plays well against a short stack's range. By raising to 96, I put maximum pressure and give them a tough decision. If they call, I'm likely ahead of their range, and I don't have to play out of position on later streets.\n\nLet me make the raise to 96.",

To put Seat 4 all-in, I should raise to at least 64.\n\nLet me make a decision: I have two pair on a dangerous board against a short stack. I should bet for value and protection. I'll raise to 64 to put pressure and likely get them all-in.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 64,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two pair (jacks and sixes) on a dangerous board with potential trips and flush draws. Against a short-stacked opponent (64 chips) who raised preflop, I should bet for value and protection. Raising to 64 puts maximum pressure and likely gets them all-in with their remaining stack.\"\n}\n```\n\nActually, let me reconsider the raise amount. The minimum raise is 32, but \"raise_to\" means the total amount I put in, not the additional amount. If I raise to 64, I'm betting 64 chips. Given the pot is 192 and opponent has 64, a 64-chip bet is about 1/3 pot, which is reasonable.\n\nBut wait - if the minimum raise is 32, and I can raise to any amount above that, raising to 64 seems good. However, I need to be careful - if they have a six, I'm drawing almost dead. But with two pair against a short stack's wide range, I'm likely ahead.\n\nLet me finalize my decision: Raise to 64 to put pressure on the short stack and get value from my two pair.",

          "reasoning_content": "  This is the first hand of the tournament, so I have no prior information about my opponents. Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My hand: 8d Qh (offsuit, middle strength)\n- Position: BTN (Button) - this is excellent position\n- Stack: 200 chips (100 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot: 9 chips\n- Facing a raise to 6 from GPT-OSS-120B in late position (seat 5)\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Q8o is a marginal hand. It's not strong enough to call a raise with typically, especially from early position in a full ring game. However, I'm on the button which gives me position advantage.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is huge. I'll act last post-flop, which gives me information advantage and control over the pot.\n\n3. **Opponent**: I have no history on GPT-OSS-120B. The raise to 6 (3x BB) is a standard opening size.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 6 to win 9, so getting 1.5:1 immediate odds. This is not enough direct odds for Q8o.\n\n5. **Implied odds**: With position and a healthy stack, I have some implied odds if I hit a strong hand. Q8 can make straights (T-9-J-Q-K, 9-T-J-Q, etc.) and two pairs.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: It's early, I have a full stack. I should be somewhat selective but can take some speculative calls in position.\n\n**Decision**: I think this is a fold. Q8o is just too weak to call a raise with, even with position. If I had something like suited connectors or a stronger offsuit hand like QJ or KT, I'd consider calling. But Q8o is dominated by many hands that would raise (AQ, KQ, QJ, QT).\n\nLet me reconsider - maybe I can call given the position advantage? The raise is only 3x, and I'm getting decent implied odds with position. However, I think the standard play here is to fold marginal hands like Q8o to a raise, even on the button. I want to avoid difficult post-flop situations with a weak hand.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully. The raise is to 6, which is 3x the BB. This is a relatively small raise. With position, calling might be acceptable to see a flop. But Q8o is really at the bottom of my calling range here. I think the disciplined play is to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nFinal decision: **FOLD**",

Play post-flop in position\n\nGiven I'm in CO and it's a 4x raise, I think calling is reasonable to set mine. However, a 3-bet could also be good to isolate and potentially win preflop. \n\nLet me think about sizing if I 3-bet. The raise is to 8, so minimum raise is 14. A standard 3-bet would be around 3x their raise, so 24-28 chips. \n\nI think I'll call here to see a flop and try to hit a set.

          "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket 8s (8h 8s) on a flop of Tc 3d Jh. This is a pretty good spot for me.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have pocket 8s. The board is Tc 3d Jh. I currently have middle pair. The only overcards are T and J. There's no flush or straight draw on this board. \n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN, which is great position. I get to act last.\n\n3. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B raised preflop to 8 (4x BB), and now bets 6 on the flop. From the recall, I can see they were aggressive in Hand #1. They raised preflop, then bet flop (4 into pot), then bet turn (8). This suggests they like to continuation bet and apply pressure.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 25, I need to call 6. That's 6 to win 25, or about 24% equity needed. With pocket 8s on this board, I likely have decent equity against their range.\n\n5. **Opponent's range**: They raised preflop from what appears to be early position (Seat 5 out of 5 players). Their range could include: overpairs (AA-QQ), AK, AQ, AJ, KQ, maybe some middle pairs like 99-JJ. On this flop (T-3-J), they could have:\n   - Top pair with AJ, KJ, QJ\n   - Overpairs (AA, KK, QQ)\n   - Maybe TT or JJ for a set\n   - Complete air (though less likely given preflop raise)\n\n6. **My equity**: With 88, I beat:\n   - Any bluff\n   - Any 3x hand\n   - Some lower pairs like 77, 66, 55, 44, 22\n   - Lose to: TT, JJ (sets), AJ, KJ, QJ, AA, KK, QQ\n\nGiven the opponent's aggressive tendencies and the fact that they only bet 6 into a 25 pot (a small bet), I think calling is reasonable. This could be a continuation bet with a wide range.\n\nHowever, I could also consider raising. A raise here would:\n- Protect my hand against overcards\n- Get value from worse hands like 99, 77, 66\n- Charge draws (though there aren't many draws on this board)\n- Potentially fold out some better hands like AJ that don't want to commit\n\nBut raising also risks getting blown off my hand by a re-raise, and I'm not sure I want to play a big pot with just middle pair.\n\nGiven my stack depth (192 chips, ~96 BB), I have room to maneuver. I think calling is the best play here to keep the pot small and see what develops on the turn, especially given my position advantage.\n\nLet me make a call.",

          "content": "  The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) has been betting consistently on every street:\n- Preflop: Raised 8 (we called)\n- Flop: Bet 6 (we called)\n- Turn: Bet 6 (we need to decide)\n\nLooking at the board: Tc 3d Jh 5s\nMy hand: 8h 8s\n\nI have a pocket pair of 8s. The board shows:\n- Tc (10 of clubs)\n- 3d (3 of diamonds)\n- Jh (Jack of hearts)\n- 5s (5 of spades)\n\nThis board is relatively dry with no flush draw possible (cards are all different suits except clubs and diamonds/hearts/spades mixed). There are some straight possibilities:\n- A-K-Q would make a straight\n- 9-7-6 would make a straight\n- Q-9 would make a straight\n\nBut my 8s don't connect well with this board. I'm losing to:\n- Any pair of Ts, Js, or higher pairs\n- Any two pair\n- Any set\n- Any straight\n\nThe opponent has been betting consistently. Their pattern from the previous hand shows they bet on every street as well. This could be:\n1. A strong hand (top pair or better)\n2. A continuation betting strategy with a wide range\n3. A draw (though there aren't many obvious draws on this board)\n\nPot odds: \n- Pot is 37 chips\n- Need to call 6 chips\n- Pot odds are 37:6 or about 6.2:1\n\nThis means I need to win about 14% of the time to break even. With pocket 8s on this board, do I have 14% equity?\n\nLet me think about what hands the opponent could have:\n- They raised preflop to 8 (4x BB), which is a strong sizing\n- They bet small on the flop (6 into 19 pot = ~32%)\n- They bet small again on the turn (6 into 31 pot = ~19%)\n\nThe small turn bet could be:\n- A value bet with a strong hand\n- A probe/blocking bet with a marginal hand\n- A bet with a draw (though limited draws exist)\n\nGiven that I have a pocket pair and the opponent has shown consistent aggression, but the board is relatively safe for an 8, I think calling is reasonable. I'm getting good pot odds and my 8s might still be good. The opponent could be betting with hands like:\n- AK, AQ (two overcards)\n- AT, A3, AJ, A5 (top pair)\n- KJ, QJ (top pair)\n- Or complete air\n\nHowever, I should be cautious. If I call the turn and face another bet on the river, I'll have a tough decision. But with these pot odds and my hand having some showdown value, I think calling is the best play.\n\nLet me check if there's any information about how this opponent plays in similar situations from previous hands.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have 8s on a board with T-J-5-3. This is not a great board for 8s. The opponent has been betting all three streets. While the pot odds are good, I'm likely behind here. The opponent's consistent betting pattern suggests they have something.\n\nPossible hands I'm ahead of:\n- AK, AQ (6 outs twice = ~24% equity for them)\n- A9, A8, A7, A6 (some outs)\n- Complete bluffs\n\nPossible hands I'm behind:\n- Any pair T or higher (AT, JT, TT, JJ, etc.)\n- Any two pair\n- Any set\n\nGiven the opponent raised preflop and has bet all three streets, I think they're more likely to have a made hand than complete air. The small bet sizing on turn could be a value bet with a strong hand or a blocking bet.\n\nWith 186 chips left (93 BB), I have a healthy stack. Preserving chips is important. Folding here might be too tight given the pot odds, but calling keeps me in a marginal spot on the river.\n\nI think the best play is to CALL. I'm getting 6.2:1 pot odds, and while I'm likely behind, I only need to be good about 14% of the time.

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) has been betting consistently on every street:\n- Preflop: Raised 8 (we called)\n- Flop: Bet 6 (we called)\n- Turn: Bet 6 (we need to decide)\n\nLooking at the board: Tc 3d Jh 5s\nMy hand: 8h 8s\n\nI have a pocket pair of 8s. The board shows:\n- Tc (10 of clubs)\n- 3d (3 of diamonds)\n- Jh (Jack of hearts)\n- 5s (5 of spades)\n\nThis board is relatively dry with no flush draw possible (cards are all different suits except clubs and diamonds/hearts/spades mixed). There are some straight possibilities:\n- A-K-Q would make a straight\n- 9-7-6 would make a straight\n- Q-9 would make a straight\n\nBut my 8s don't connect well with this board. I'm losing to:\n- Any pair of Ts, Js, or higher pairs\n- Any two pair\n- Any set\n- Any straight\n\nThe opponent has been betting consistently. Their pattern from the previous hand shows they bet on every street as well. This could be:\n1. A strong hand (top pair or better)\n2. A continuation betting strategy with a wide range\n3. A draw (though there aren't many obvious draws on this board)\n\nPot odds: \n- Pot is 37 chips\n- Need to call 6 chips\n- Pot odds are 37:6 or about 6.2:1\n\nThis means I need to win about 14% of the time to break even. With pocket 8s on this board, do I have 14% equity?\n\nLet me think about what hands the opponent could have:\n- They raised preflop to 8 (4x BB), which is a strong sizing\n- They bet small on the flop (6 into 19 pot = ~32%)\n- They bet small again on the turn (6 into 31 pot = ~19%)\n\nThe small turn bet could be:\n- A value bet with a strong hand\n- A probe/blocking bet with a marginal hand\n- A bet with a draw (though limited draws exist)\n\nGiven that I have a pocket pair and the opponent has shown consistent aggression, but the board is relatively safe for an 8, I think calling is reasonable. I'm getting good pot odds and my 8s might still be good. The opponent could be betting with hands like:\n- AK, AQ (two overcards)\n- AT, A3, AJ, A5 (top pair)\n- KJ, QJ (top pair)\n- Or complete air\n\nHowever, I should be cautious. If I call the turn and face another bet on the river, I'll have a tough decision. But with these pot odds and my hand having some showdown value, I think calling is the best play.\n\nLet me check if there's any information about how this opponent plays in similar situations from previous hands.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have 8s on a board with T-J-5-3. This is not a great board for 8s. The opponent has been betting all three streets. While the pot odds are good, I'm likely behind here. The opponent's consistent betting pattern suggests they have something.\n\nPossible hands I'm ahead of:\n- AK, AQ (6 outs twice = ~24% equity for them)\n- A9, A8, A7, A6 (some outs)\n- Complete bluffs\n\nPossible hands I'm behind:\n- Any pair T or higher (AT, JT, TT, JJ, etc.)\n- Any two pair\n- Any set\n\nGiven the opponent raised preflop and has bet all three streets, I think they're more likely to have a made hand than complete air. The small bet sizing on turn could be a value bet with a strong hand or a blocking bet.\n\nWith 186 chips left (93 BB), I have a healthy stack. Preserving chips is important. Folding here might be too tight given the pot odds, but calling keeps me in a marginal spot on the river.\n\nI think the best play is to CALL. I'm getting 6.2:1 pot odds, and while I'm likely behind, I only need to be good about 14% of the time. My 8s might be good against some of the opponent's range, and I have position so I can control the pot on the river.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully. The opponent bet 8 preflop (4x BB), then bet 6 on flop (into 19), then 6 on turn (into 31). The decreasing bet sizes relative to pot suggest they might be weakening, or they could be value betting with a medium strength hand.\n\nGiven I have position and decent pot odds, I'll call and evaluate on the river.

My hand: Pocket 8s - not great on this board\n2. Board: T-J-5-3 with no flush draw - I lose to any T, J, or 5, and any overpair\n3. Opponent: Has bet preflop, flop, and turn showing consistent aggression\n4. Pot odds: 37:6 = 6.17:1, so I need ~14% equity to call\n\nThe opponent's betting pattern suggests they have a real hand. They've bet 8 preflop (4x BB), 6 on flop (into 19), and 6 on turn (into 31). The consistent betting likely means they have something like:\n- Top pair (AT, JT, AJ, KJ)\n- Overpair (QQ, KK, AA)\n- Two pair or better\n\nWith 8s, I'm likely behind. However, the pot odds are decent. But I have to consider that if I call turn, I'll face another decision on the river where I might lose more chips.\n\nGiven my stack is healthy at 93 BB, and this spot is marginal at best, I think folding is the correct play. I don't want to invest more chips with a marginal hand when I'm likely behind and could lose more on the river. The opponent's consistent aggression suggests strength.\n\nLet me reconsider though... The pot odds are 6.2:1, which is very good. I only need to win 14% of the time. Even if I'm behind most of the time, could my 8s be good 14% of the time?\n\nActually, I think I'm overthinking this. \n\nI'm facing a small turn bet of 6 into a 31 pot. The odds suggest this could be a blocking bet or a probe bet. With my pocket 8s, I'm getting excellent pot odds to see the river. The risk of losing more chips is manageable given my stack size. I'll make the call and potentially catch a card that improves my hand or gives me more information about my opponent's strength.",

The final board shows two tens (Tc, Th), and I have no flush or straight possibilities. My pocket 8s are not improved by the board. So I have a pair of 8s.\n\n2. **Opponent's possible hands**: The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) raised preflop to 8, then bet on the flop (6), bet on the turn (6), and now checked on the river. The board has paired with tens (two tens on board). This could mean:\n   - They had a strong hand like AJ, KJ, QJ, JT, AT, KT, QT, or even TT\n   - They could have been bluffing or semi-bluffing with a draw\n   - The river check suggests they might not have a strong hand, or they're scared of the paired board\n\n3. **My relative hand strength**: With two tens on board, the best possible hand is:\n   - Four of a kind (TTTT) if someone has TT\n   - Full house (any hand with a ten and another pair, or three of a kind with the ten)\n   - Trips (any hand with a ten)\n   - Two pair (any hand with a ten and another card that pairs the board)\n   \n   My pair of 8s is very weak on this board. Almost any hand with a ten beats me, any pocket pair 9s or better beats me, and any two pair beats me.\n\n4. **Opponent's behavior**: From the recall, I see that GPT-OSS-120B has been aggressive preflop and on the flop and turn, but now checked on the river. This could be:\n   - A trap with a very strong hand\n   - A give-up after missing a draw\n   - A medium-strength hand that's scared of the paired board\n   \n5. **Pot size**: The pot is 43 chips. My stack is 180. I have a healthy stack.\n\n6. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position.\n\n7. **Action**: It's checked to me. I can check or raise. \n\nGiven that my hand is very weak (pair of 8s on a board with two tens), and the opponent has shown aggression throughout but now checks, I should be very cautious. My hand is unlikely to be the best hand here. Checking is the safe play. Raising would be a pure bluff, which is risky given the opponent's preflop and postflop aggression.\n\nLet me think about what hands the opponent could have:\n- If they have a ten, they have trips and beat me easily\n- If they have JJ, they have a full house (Jacks full of tens) \n- If they have AA, KK, QQ, 99, they have a higher pair than me\n- If they have a draw that missed, I might have the best hand\n- If they have a medium pocket pair like 77, 66, 55, 44, 33, 22, I might have the best hand EXCEPT they bet the flop and turn which suggests strength\n\nThe opponent's betting pattern (raise preflop, bet flop, bet turn, check river) suggests they had something but the river check is suspicious. However, with my weak pair of 8s, I shouldn't try to bluff here. The risk is too high.\n\nI should check and see a showdown.",

Let me analyze what I see:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ah 2d (ace of hearts, 2 of diamonds) - This is a weak hand, only an ace with a very weak kicker. Not a good hand to play from any position.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position, but that doesn't compensate for a very weak hand.\n\n3. **My stack**: 182 chips (91 BB) - Healthy stack, no pressure.\n\n4. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6 from late position (seat 5). I need to call 6 to continue.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data:\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been active in early hands, raising preflop (hands 1, 2, 6) and betting postflop\n   - They raised to 6 in hand 1 and 6 (same amount)\n   - They raised to 8 in hand 2 \n   - They folded in hands 4 and 5\n   - So they're capable of raising with a range, but also folding when facing action\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 6 to win a pot of 15 (9 + 6). That's 2.5:1 odds, which isn't great for a speculative hand.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack, I don't need to take marginal spots. A2o is a very weak hand that will often be dominated by better aces.\n\n8. **Position advantage**: Even on the button, A2o is too weak to call a raise. The ace is tempting but the kicker is terrible.\n\nDecision: This is an easy fold. A2o is a trash hand, especially when facing a raise. Even with position, the hand has very poor equity and I'll often be dominated. The opponent's raise suggests strength, and I don't want to invest 6 chips (3% of my stack) on a hand that will miss most flops and be difficult to play postflop.\n\n\nI'll fold this hand immediately.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Context:**\n- Position: UTG (earliest position, worst position)\n- Cards: 9c Qc (Queen-9 suited)\n- Stack: 182 chips (91 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- To call: 2 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Q9s is a marginal hand, especially from UTG. It's not strong enough to open-raise from early position in most situations. While it's suited, the kicker (9) is weak.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll have to act first on all postflop streets with 7 players still to act behind me. This significantly reduces the playability of marginal hands.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I'm deep stacked at 91 BB, so I have room to be selective.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the recall, I can see:\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) has been calling and checking a lot, playing somewhat passively\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has folded most hands\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has been aggressive, making raises and big bets\n\n5. **My Recent Play**: I've been playing quite tight - folded in 4 out of 6 hands, with 1 win and 1 loss.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- Early in tournament (based on stack sizes)\n- From UTG with a marginal hand, the standard play is to fold\n- Calling would put me in a difficult position postflop with a weak hand out of position\n- Raising would be an overplay of this hand from early position\n\n**Decision**: Fold. Q9s is simply not strong enough to play from UTG position. The risk/reward is poor, and I'll be out of position against multiple opponents. This is a clear fold in tournament poker strategy.",

It's not connected, not suited, and J2 is one of the worst hands in poker. Even though I have position (I'll act last post-flop), this hand has very little potential.\n\nThe pot is small (5 chips), and I have a big stack (180 chips). I should not invest more chips with this garbage hand. The correct play is to check and see a free flop, or fold if there's a raise (but there's no raise here).\n\nSince MiniMax-M2 just called, they likely have a marginal hand - maybe some suited connectors, small pocket pairs, or broadway cards.

This is the clear best option.\n\nLet me think about any tournament considerations: I'm at 90 BB which is a healthy stack. I don't need to take risks with garbage hands.

The only hand that beats me is 55 (full house), which is very unlikely given the preflop action.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB, which is out of position, but with this monster hand that's fine.\n\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 called preflop from late position (seat 4). Looking at their history, they've been very tight - folding most hands preflop. They only called once before (hand #4) and then folded. This suggests they likely have a decent hand but not premium.\n\n4. **Board**: 5h Js Jh - This is a paired board with trip Jacks. Very dry board with no real draws except backdoor flush/straight draws.\n\n5. **Action**: They called preflop and now it's checked to them on the flop. The pot is 5 chips.\n\n**Decision**: With trip Jacks, I have a monster hand. I should definitely bet for value. I want to get chips in while I'm almost certainly ahead. Since the opponent is tight, I should bet a reasonable size to get value from hands like:\n- Any Jack (though unlikely they have one)\n- Pocket pairs 66-TT\n- 5x hands\n- Random floats\n\nGiven the pot is 5 chips and stacks are deep (180 chips), I should make a solid value bet. A bet of 4-5 chips (80-100% pot) seems appropriate to get value and protect against the unlikely event they have a draw or are waiting for a card.\n\nSince the minimum raise is 2 chips, but I want to bet, I need to raise to a total amount. If I want to bet 4 chips total, I'd raise to 4.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount. The pot is 5 chips. A standard value bet would be 3-4 chips (60-80% pot). Given how strong my hand is and that I want to build the pot, I'll go with 4 chips.",

This is a very strong hand, only losing to pocket 5s (which would make quads) or pocket pairs that make a full house.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n1. My hand: Trip Jacks (Jc in hand + Js Jh on board) - very strong hand\n2. Position: I'm in BB, first to act on flop\n3. My stack: 176 chips (88 BB) - healthy stack\n4. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 - from the recall, they seem tight, folding most preflop hands. They called preflop and now raised on the flop\n5. Pot: 17 chips\n6. Current action: I bet 4, they raised to 8 (min-raise)\n\nThe opponent's raise to 8 is a min-raise. Given their tight nature (folding most hands preflop), they likely have something decent. Possible hands:\n- A pair (maybe 5s for trips, or another pocket pair)\n- A draw (straight or flush draw)\n- A weaker Jack (but I have Jc, so only Jd is possible)\n\nSince I have trip Jacks which is very strong, I should consider raising for value. I need to think about:\n- If they have a draw, I want to charge them\n- If they have a weaker made hand, I want to extract value\n- I need to protect against potential full houses or quads\n\nThe minimum raise is to 12 total (which is 4 more to call). I could also consider a larger raise.\n\nGiven the strength of my hand and the relatively small pot, I should raise for value. A raise to about 20-25 chips seems appropriate to build the pot while still getting calls from weaker hands.\n\nLet me raise to 24 chips total. This is a solid raise that:\n1. Builds the pot with my strong hand\n2. Charges draws appropriately\n3. Gives worse hands a chance to call\n4. Doesn't commit my entire stack yet",

          "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket 2s in the SB. I need to make a decision about what to do.\n\nFirst, let me analyze the situation:\n- Hand: 2c 2s (pocket deuces) - This is a low pocket pair\n- Position: SB (small blind) - This is one of the worst positions\n- Stack: 192 chips (96 BB)\n- Action: Seat 5 raised to 6 (3x the BB)\n- To call: 5 chips\n- Pot: 9 chips\n\nPocket pairs like 2s are speculative hands. They have value because:\n1. They can flop a set (about 11.8% chance or ~1 in 8.5 times)\n2. When they hit a set, they often win big pots\n3. They can sometimes win unimproved against high cards\n\nHowever, there are significant drawbacks:\n1. They're vulnerable to overcards on the flop\n2. From SB, I'll be out of position post-flop\n3. I'll be heads-up against a raiser who has shown aggression\n\nLet me think about what I learned from the opponent's history:\n- GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop 3 times in the past (hands 1, 2, and 6)\n- Raises were 6, 8, and 6 chips\n- This suggests they play relatively aggressively preflop\n\nThe key question is: Do I have the implied odds to call?\n\nTo call: 5 chips\nCurrent pot: 9 chips\nPot odds: 5/9 = 55.5%\n\nFor set mining, I want to see if I can win enough when I hit to justify the call. The rule of thumb is that I need to be able to win at least 10-15x the amount I call when I hit a set.\n\nI need to win approximately: 5 x 12 = 60 chips when I hit\n\nIf I call 5, the pot will be 14 chips. I would need to win about 4.3x the pot size when I hit. \n\nI have 192 chips, which is deep enough. The raiser has 289 chips, also deep. Both players have enough chips to pay me off.\n\nHowever, the problems are:\n1. I'm out of position - this makes it harder to extract value\n2. Low pocket pairs are hard to play out of position\n3. If I don't hit (which is 7 out of 8 times), I'll often have to fold to continuation bets\n\nGiven that I'm in the SB and will be out of position, and pocket 2s are the smallest pair, I think this is a fold. The combination of poor position and low pair strength makes this a marginal spot at best.\n\nIf I were in position or had a bigger pocket pair, I'd be more inclined to call. But from SB with 2s, I think folding is the best play.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 96 BB stacks, set mining can be profitable. But the position disadvantage is significant. I think I'll fold and wait for a better spot.",

It's not a premium hand but has good playability postflop, especially in position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (Button), which is the best position in poker. I'll act last on every street postflop.\n\n3. **Stack**: 192 chips (96 BB) - Healthy stack, plenty of room to play.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - SB posted 1\n   - BB posted 2\n   - Seat 4 folded\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for GPT-OSS-120B:\n   - Hand 6: Made a river bet of 45 (showing aggression)\n   - Hand 7: Preflop fold\n   - Hand 8: Called 4 preflop, then check-folded on turn (showing some weakness)\n   - Hand 9: Preflop fold\n   - Hand 10: Raised to 6 preflop, then bet 8 on flop and 20 on turn (showing aggression)\n\n   So GPT-OSS-120B seems to have a mix of aggressive and passive play. They've shown they can raise preflop and continue with aggression postflop.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 11 (SB+BB+raise). That's about 42% of the pot. With JTs on the button, this is a reasonable call.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 96 BB, I have a healthy stack. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position. JTs has good implied odds.\n\nDecision: I should call here. JTs is a good hand to play in position against a single raiser. I have the advantage of acting last postflop, and the pot odds are reasonable. Folding would be too tight, and raising would be too aggressive with a speculative hand against an opponent who has shown they can play back.",

Given their tight nature, this suggests significant strength. They're not a maniac - they fold most hands.\n\nMy hand: Ts Jh\n- This is a decent suited connector but not a premium hand\n- On the BTN, this is a good hand to see flops with\n- However, facing a 3-bet from a tight player, this is likely behind their range\n\nMy position: BTN - good position, but I'm facing a 3-bet\n\nStack considerations: I have 92 BB, so I have room to play, but I don't want to get into trouble with a marginal hand.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature and this 3-bet, I should fold.

It's often dominated by AK, AQ, AA, KK, QQ. From UTG, this is typically a fold in tournaments because:\n1. We're likely to face raises from better hands\n2. If we raise, we might get 3-bet\n3. If we call and hit top pair, we could lose a big pot to better kickers\n\n**Opponent Observations from recent hands:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3): Has been aggressive preflop (raised to 6 in hand 8), but also folds to pressure\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Tends to call preflop (called in hand 9), but raised on flop\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Active preflop raiser (raised in hands 10 and 11), but folded to a 3-bet in hand 11\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Folded multiple times, called a raise in hand 10 but folded to turn pressure\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 92 BB\n- No need to take marginal spots from early position\n- Better to preserve chips for better spots\n\n**Position Factor:**\n- UTG is the worst position\n- 4 players still to act behind me\n- High chance someone has a better hand\n\n**Recommendation:**\nFold KQo from UTG. It's not strong enough to raise from this position, and calling would put us in a tough spot post-flop. We want to avoid being dominated by AK, AQ, AA, KK, QQ. \n\n{action: \"fold\", raise_to: null, reasoning: \"KQ offsuit is too weak to play from UTG in a tournament.

It's offsuit and disconnected.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Good position, but that doesn't help much with such a weak hand.\n\n**Stack**: 182 chips (91 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n**Situation**: \n- Blinds are 1/2\n- Pot is 9 chips (1 from SB + 2 from BB + 6 from DeepSeek-V3.2's raise)\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 6 from Seat 3 (MP position)\n- I need to call 4 chips to see the flop\n\n**Pot odds**: 4 to win 9 = 2.25:1, which is not great for a hand this weak.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's recent actions:\n- Hand 13: preflop fold\n- Hand 12: preflop fold\n- Hand 11: preflop fold\n- Hand 10: preflop fold\n- Hand 9: preflop fold\n- Hand 8: preflop raise 6, then check flop, bet turn\n- Hand 7: preflop fold\n- Hand 6: river call 45\n\nThis opponent seems relatively tight, folding preflop 7 out of last 9 opportunities. When they do raise (hand 8), they showed aggression postflop with a turn bet.\n\n**Decision**: With 9-2 offsuit, even in position, this is a clear fold. The hand has almost no potential - it can't make a straight without a 4-card gap, and the flush potential is minimal (only one club). Even if I flop a pair, it will be a weak pair with a terrible kicker. \n\nThe opponent's raise suggests they have a real hand, and calling 4 chips with 9-2 offsuit is burning money. \n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I've analyzed my recent hands and I can see a pattern of very tight play. Let me think about this specific situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm UTG (Under The Gun - first to act)\n- Cards: Kd Tc (King-ten offsuit)\n- Stack: 181 chips (90.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- I need to call 2 to see the flop\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength**: KTo is a marginal hand in early position. It's not strong enough to play profitably from UTG in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act on every street with 4 players still to act behind me.\n\n3. **My recent play**: Looking at my hand history, I've been playing extremely tight:\n   - Hand 13: Folded QTs from UTG\n   - Hand 12: Folded KQo from CO facing a raise\n   - Hand 11: Folded TJs from BTN facing a 3-bet\n   - Hand 10: Folded pocket 2s from SB\n   - Hand 8: Folded 69o from UTG\n\n   I've been folding a lot, which suggests I have a tight image but also that I might be playing too passively.\n\n4. **Stack size**: I have a healthy stack of 90.5 BB, so I don't need to take marginal spots.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: In a tournament, preserving chips is important, and playing marginal hands from early position is generally -EV.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. KTo is simply not strong enough to open from UTG. Even though I've been playing very tight and might want to mix it up, this is not the hand to do it with. The risk of running into a dominating hand (any Ace, any King with a better kicker, pocket pairs, etc.) is too high from this position.\n\nI should wait for a better spot, preferably with a stronger hand or better position.",

When they do raise preflop (like now), they likely have a strong hand.\n\n**Position and pot odds:**\n- I'm in BB, which is out of position postflop\n- Pot is 7 chips, I need to call 2 chips\n- Pot odds: 7:2 or 3.5:1\n- This is decent pot odds, but...\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (89.5 BB)\n- J4s is a weak hand, especially out of position\n- Against a tight player who raised, I'm likely dominated\n- Even with suited cards, the reverse implied odds are bad (if I hit a flush, I could lose to a higher flush)\n- The one-gapper straight potential is very unlikely\n\n**Decision:**\nDespite the decent pot odds, this is a clear fold. J4s is too weak to call a raise from a tight player while being out of position. \n\nI'll preserve my chips for better opportunities. The potential flush draw might seem tempting, but the risk of being dominated by a stronger flush makes this an easy decision. Playing out of position with a marginal hand against a tight opponent is a recipe for losing chips.",

I'll be first to act post-flop.\n\n**Stack:** 178 chips (89 BB) - Deep stack, plenty of room to maneuver.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Blinds are 1/2 (1 SB, 2 BB)\n- Pot is 9 chips (includes 1 from SB, 2 from BB, and 6 from Seat 5's raise)\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6 (3x BB)\n- I need to call 5 more chips\n- I can raise to minimum 10 or more\n\n**Opponent analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see:\n- Very tight player: folded in 7 out of 10 hands\n- Only raised once before (hand #15) with a 4 chip raise\n- When they did get to showdown (hand #18), they checked preflop, then bet 2 on flop and 6 on turn - showing they can be aggressive when they have something\n\nThis player appears to be very tight, folding most hands. Their raise to 6 chips from late position (CO) suggests they have a strong hand. Given their tight nature, this is likely:\n- Premium pairs: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT\n- Strong broadway hands: AK, AQ, maybe AJ, KQ\n- Possibly medium pairs: 99-77\n\n**My hand consideration:**\nAJ offsuit from SB vs a tight player's raise is marginal at best. I'm dominated by:\n- AA, KK, QQ, JJ (crushing me)\n- AK, AQ (dominating me)\n- Even against TT-77, I'm roughly 44-56 underdog\n\n**Position disadvantage:** Being in SB means I'll act first post-flop, which is a significant disadvantage.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 5 to win 9, so 5:9 or about 1.8:1. This is not great odds for a marginal hand.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 89 BB, I'm deep enough that I don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving my stack for better opportunities is wise.\n\n**Conclusion:** Fold. This is a clear fold. I'm out of position with a marginal hand against a tight player's raise. The player has shown they only raise with strong hands. Even though AJ looks decent, it's a losing proposition here due to position, opponent strength, and tournament considerations.",

Even if called, I have position advantage postflop.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent tendencies:\n\nFrom Seat 2 (Kimi-K2, SB):\n- Has been folding frequently in recent hands (hands 17-20 all folded preflop)\n- Only played hand #16 where they called preflop with 5c4h (very weak hand)\n- Seems to be playing tight/passive\n\nFrom Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2, BB):\n- More active, with some preflop raises (hand #17 raised to 6)\n- Has shown willingness to defend BB\n- Has folded some hands too (hands 19-20)\n- Showed down pocket 6s in hand #6\n\nMy situation:\n- Position: Button (best position)\n- Hand: Qs 8h (offsuit, not connected, mediocre hand)\n- Stack: 178 chips (44.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Need to call 4 chips to see flop\n- Pot odds: 6:4 or 1.5:1\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Hand strength: Q8o is marginal. Not suited, not connected. Dominated by many hands.\n2. Position: Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last postflop.\n3. Opponents: SB is tight/passive, folding a lot. BB is more active but has been folding recently.\n4. Stack size: I have a comfortable stack, can afford to see flops.\n5. Tournament: Early/middle stage, no immediate pressure.\n\nGiven I'm on the button with position advantage, and both opponents have shown recent folding tendencies, I could consider a steal raise here. The SB has folded 4 straight hands preflop, and BB has folded 2 straight. They're both playing tight.\n\nHowever, Q8o is quite weak. The question is whether to:\n- Fold: Safe play, avoid trouble with marginal hand\n- Call: See flop in position with mediocre hand\n- Raise: Try to steal blinds given opponents' tightness\n\nWith the SB showing very tight play (4 consecutive folds) and BB also folding recently, a raise could be profitable as a steal attempt. A standard raise would be to about 12-16 chips (3-4x BB).\n\n\nI'll make a strategic steal attempt. A 12-chip raise puts pressure on tight opponents while minimizing risk. The raise gives me a chance to win the pot immediately or play in position if called. It's a calculated move exploiting the current table dynamics.",

Ace-Queen offsuit is a premium hand that I should be playing.\n\n**Position:** UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table since I'll be acting first on all post-flop streets. I need to be more cautious with marginal hands from this position, but AQ is strong enough to play.\n\n**Stack size:** 184 chips (46 BB) - This is a healthy stack, not in danger zone yet.\n\n**Opponents to act:** 3 players behind me (Seat 2, 3, 4) plus the big blind.\n\n**Opponent information from the search:**\n\n1. **DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB):** \n   - Has shown aggression with raises (hands 14, 17)\n   - Has also folded frequently (hands 15, 19, 20, 21)\n   - Called preflop in hand 18\n   - Generally seems to be playing tight-aggressive but with some folds\n   - Stack: 110 chips (27.5 BB) - shorter stack\n\n2. **MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB):**\n   - Generally tight, has folded many hands\n   - Did call preflop once in hand 16 (with KdJs)\n   - Has made some raises (hand 19)\n   - Stack: 195 chips (48.75 BB) - similar to mine\n\n**Key observations:**\n- Both opponents behind me have shown they can fold to aggression\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 has a shorter stack and might be looking for spots\n- From UTG with AQ, I should raise to both build the pot with a strong hand and gain information\n- A standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 12 chips\n\n**Tournament considerations:** \n- I have a healthy stack, so I can afford to play this hand aggressively\n- AQ is strong enough to play from UTG, but I need to be aware I might face 3-bets from strong hands\n- If I get re-raised, I'll need to consider the opponent and their stack size\n\n**Decision:** I should raise. AQ is too strong to just call from UTG. A standard raise to 12 chips (3x BB) seems appropriate. This will:\n1. Build the pot with a strong hand\n2. Potentially isolate against weaker hands\n3. Give me initiative post-flop\n4. Charge draws and weaker hands to see the flop\n\nIf I get 3-bet, I'll need to evaluate based on the opponent and their sizing, but for now, raising is the clear play.",

DeepSeek-V3.2 only has 2 chips left after posting the small blind, so they're essentially shoving with any decent hand. The fact that they've been tight suggests they might have a real hand, but the desperation factor of having only 0.5 BB left means they could be shoving wide.\n\nMy stack: 172 chips (43 BB)\nPot odds: I need to call 98 to win 224 = 2.28:1, which means I need ~30.5% equity\n\nAgainst a typical short stack shove range (any pair, any Ace, any broadway, some suited connectors), AQ has about 55-60% equity.\n\nEven against a tight range like: 77+, ATs+, AJo+, KQs, KQo, I have about 50% equity.\n\nThis is a clear call. I have:\n1. Strong hand (AQ suited)\n2. Good position\n3. Great pot odds\n4. Opponent is desperate with <1 BB\n\nThe only concern is tournament life preservation, but I'm not risking my entire stack (I'd have 74 chips left if I lose), and the pot odds are too good to fold.\n\nI should call.",

That's a strong hand on this board.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is great position.\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 3 is the only opponent left. They have only 2 chips left (0.5 BB) after the preflop action.\n4. **Board**: 8c As 5c - There's a club flush draw possible. I have the Ace of spades, which blocks the nut flush draw but not completely.\n5. **Pot size**: 224 chips, and I only have 74 chips left.\n6. **Preflop action**: Seat 3 made a huge raise to 110 (which is more than their stack - they went all-in effectively), and I called 98. So they have 2 chips left.\n\nGiven that my opponent only has 2 chips left and checked, I should definitely check here. There's no value in betting because:\n- They can't call a meaningful bet (only have 2 chips)\n- If they have any hand, they'll likely bet their last 2 chips\n- Checking gives them a chance to put in their last chips\n- I don't need to protect against anything since they're essentially all-in\n\nI should check and see what they do with their last 2 chips.\n\nActually, let me think about this more carefully. The pot is 224 and I have 74. My opponent has 2 chips left. \n\nIf I bet, I could potentially get them to fold and win the 224 pot without showdown. But that would be a terrible outcome because:\n1. I have a very strong hand (top pair, top kicker)\n2. They're extremely short-stacked and likely to put in their last chips with a wide range\n3. The risk of them outdrawing me is minimal compared to the chips already in the pot\n\nChecking is clearly the correct play.

The opponent check-raised preflop (from 12 to 110), which is a huge raise\n2. They checked the flop and turn, which is interesting after such an aggressive preflop raise\n3. They only have 2 chips left (0.5 BB), so they're pot-committed\n4. The pot is already 224 chips, which is HUGE relative to my 74 chip stack\n5. I have top pair, top kicker (Ace with Queen kicker)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies from Recall:**\n- They've been relatively tight, folding preflop in several recent hands\n- They made a big preflop raise in hand #17 (raise to 6)\n- They called small bets in hand #18 but folded on the turn\n- They haven't shown any showdowns, so their aggression level is unclear\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have top pair, top kicker on a board with potential flush draw (3 clubs) and straight draws\n- The opponent's huge preflop raise suggests a strong hand (maybe AK, AQ, AJ, or a premium pair)\n- The fact they checked flop and turn after being so aggressive preflop is suspicious\n- They could have: AK (splitting with me), AQ (chopping), AJ, AT, a set, or a big pocket pair\n- They could also have a flush draw that missed or a straight draw\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 224, I have 74 left\n- If I bet and they call with their last 2 chips, I'm risking 2 to win 226\n- The pot is already so big relative to my stack that I can't fold\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm short-stacked with 18.5 BB\n- The pot is already 3x my stack\n- Folding would leave me with 74 chips in a 224 chip pot that I could have won\n- This is a clear call/getting it in situation with top pair, top kicker\n\n**Decision:**\nThe opponent has checked to me on the turn with only 2 chips left.

This means if I check, they might check again or bet their last 2 chips.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. The amount to call is 0, so checking is free. If I check, my opponent with 2 chips will likely check (since they have so little) or might try to bet their last 2 chips as a bluff.\n\nBut actually, I need to think about this differently. With top pair, top kicker and a pot that's already 3x my stack, I cannot fold. The only question is whether to check or bet. But betting isn't an option according to legal actions - only fold or check.\n\nWait, let me re-read. \"Amount to call: 0\" means it's checked to me. \"Legal actions: fold, check\" - this means I cannot bet, only check or fold.\n\nGiven that I have top pair, top kicker and the pot is 224 while I only have 74, folding is absolutely not an option.

The pot is already 224 chips, which is enormous relative to my 74 chip stack (3x my stack)\n2. I have top pair, top kicker (pair of Aces with Queen kicker)\n3. Opponent has only 2 chips left and has checked to me\n4. I cannot bet according to legal actions, only check or fold\n5. Folding would be absolutely terrible - I'd give up a 224 chip pot where I have top pair top kicker\n\n**Opponent's line:**\n- Huge preflop check-raise (110 chips)\n- Check on flop\n- Check on turn\n\nThis is a strange line. The huge preflop raise suggests strength, but then checking twice suggests weakness or a draw that missed.\n\n**Possible opponent hands:**\n- AK: Now has two pair (Aces and Kings) - would beat me\n- AQ: Would chop with me\n- AJ, AT: Would lose to me\n- Pocket pairs (KK, QQ, JJ, TT): QQ would lose, KK would win, others would lose\n- Sets: AA, KK, 88, 55 - would all beat me\n- Flush draw: Might have checked twice with a draw\n- Straight draw: Might have checked twice with a draw\n- Pure bluff: Unlikely given the huge preflop raise\n\n**Key insight:** The opponent's huge preflop raise followed by two checks is very suspicious. This often indicates:\n1. A monster hand that is slowplaying (less likely given the draw-heavy board)\n2. A strong hand that is scared of the turn card (maybe AJ, AT)\n3. A draw that missed\n4. AK that now has two pair\n\n**My decision:** I cannot fold. The pot is too big relative to my stack, and I have top pair top kicker. I must check and go to showdown. \n\nWith only 2 chips remaining, my opponent is essentially all-in. Checking seems like the most prudent move, allowing me to see the showdown without risking additional chips. The massive pot and my strong hand make folding an unwise choice.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with Qs Ad\n- My stack: 74 chips (18.5 BB)\n- Board: 8c As 5c Kh Jh\n- Pot: 224 chips\n- Opponent: DeepSeek-V3.2 with only 2 chips left\n- Action: It's checked to me on the river\n\n**My hand:** I have top pair (Aces) with Q kicker. The board has 4 hearts (8c As 5c Kh Jh) - wait, let me recount: 8c (club), As (spade), 5c (club), Kh (heart), Jh (heart). So there are 2 hearts on the board (Kh and Jh). \n\nActually, let me recount the suits: 8\u2663, A\u2660, 5\u2663, K\u2665, J\u2665. So there are 2 hearts. No flush possible unless someone has two hearts.\n\n**Hand strength:** I have top pair, top kicker (AQ). The board is relatively coordinated with K and J, but I still have top pair. However, there are straight possibilities (Q-10, though I have one Q), and two pair possibilities.\n\n**Opponent analysis:** Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's actions:\n- They post SB (2 chips)\n- Preflop: They raise to 110 (all-in essentially, as they only had 2 chips left after posting SB)\n- I called 98\n- Flop: check\n- Turn: check  \n- River: check\n\nSince they only have 2 chips left and they've checked the river, they likely have a weak hand or are giving up. They made a big preflop raise with a short stack, which could indicate a strong hand or a desperation move.\n\n**Pot odds:** The pot is 224 and I can check for free. No need to risk anything.\n\n**My decision:** I should check back here. My opponent has shown weakness by checking the river with a tiny stack. I have showdown value with top pair, but the board is somewhat scary with K and J. Since I can see a free showdown and my opponent only has 2 chips left (can't bet anyway), checking is the optimal play. Betting would only fold out worse hands and get called by better hands.\n\nLet me verify - they have 2 chips left, so they can't bet. I should check and go to showdown.",

King high but very marginal.\n\n2. **Position**: BB (Big Blind) - Not ideal position post-flop.\n\n3. **Action**: \n   - MiniMax-M2 raised from 4 to 8 (minimum raise of 4)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B called from SB\n   - I need to call 4 more chips to see the flop\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 294 chips (73.5 BB)\n   - MiniMax-M2: 185 chips (46.25 BB)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B: 300 chips (75 BB)\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - MiniMax-M2: Very tight! Only raised once in recent 9 hands (hand #19), folded preflop 8 out of 10 times. When they did play (hand #16), they were aggressive post-flop with betting.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B: Somewhat tight but more active. They've folded preflop 7 out of 10 times, but they raised once (hand #20) and played post-flop aggressively in hand #18.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Current pot: 20 chips\n   - Amount to call: 4 chips\n   - Pot odds: 20:4 or 5:1\n\n7. **Analysis**:\n   - I have a trash hand (K3o) that plays very poorly post-flop\n   - MiniMax-M2's raise suggests a strong hand given their tight nature\n   - GPT-OSS-120B's call could be with a wide range from the SB\n   - The pot odds are decent (5:1) but this hand has very poor equity\n   - Even if I hit a King, I'll often be dominated by better kickers\n   - I'm out of position against two players\n   - Given the tight nature of MiniMax-M2, their raising range is likely strong (pairs, strong broadway hands)\n\nThe pot odds are tempting but this hand is just too weak and I'll be out of position. The combination of a tight raiser and being OOP makes this an easy fold. I don't want to invest chips with such a marginal hand that will be difficult to play post-flop.\n\nEven though I'm getting 5:1 on my call, the reverse implied odds (losing more when I'm dominated) and poor playability make this a clear fold.",

It's not strong enough to 3-bet for value, but it has good implied odds if I hit.\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB, which is the worst position. I'll be out of position postflop.\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 292 chips (73 BB), which is a healthy stack. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands.\n4. **Opponent tendency**: GPT-OSS-120B appears to be playing relatively tight, which means when they raise, they likely have a decent hand. However, they also seem to give up easily postflop (folded on flop in hand 24 after calling preflop).\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 10 to win 18, so I'm getting 1.8:1 odds. This is marginal for a speculative hand like 78s.\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 73 BB, I can afford to play some speculative hands, especially against opponents who may fold postflop.\n\nThe key factor here is that I'll be out of position postflop. With a tight opponent who seems to give up on flops, I could potentially float or bluff later streets if they show weakness. However, being OOP makes it harder to realize my equity.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature and tendency to fold postflop, and the fact that I have a decent stack, I think calling is reasonable here. The hand has good implied odds if I hit a strong draw or two pair+ type hand, and I can potentially steal pots on later streets if the opponent shows weakness.\n\nI don't want to 3-bet here because:\n- I'm out of position\n- 78s doesn't have enough raw equity against a tight raising range\n- I don't have fold equity against a tight player who just raised\n\nI could fold, but with 73 BB, I think calling is profitable enough given the opponent's postflop tendencies.\n\nLet me call 10 chips.",

The board shows 6s 6d 9d Qs. \n- I have an open-ended straight draw with 5 or 10 making a straight\n- The board is paired (66) which is concerning\n- There's a possible flush draw on the board (diamonds)\n- I don't have any made hand currently\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nGPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) raised preflop to 12, but then checked the flop. This suggests:\n- They might have missed the flop\n- They could have a medium-strength hand that doesn't want to bet multi-way\n- They could be trapping with a strong hand\n\nFrom the opponent's history:\n- They raise preflop fairly often (hands 18, 20, 24)\n- They continuation bet on the flop in hand 18\n- They've folded to pressure before\n- In hand 24 they called preflop then check-folded on the flop\n\n**Position and Stack Considerations:**\n- I'm in SB, out of position\n- I have a healthy stack of 70.5 BB\n- Pot is 36 chips, which is about 9 BB\n- I can afford to take a shot here\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nIf I check, I see a free card. If I bet, I need to consider if I have fold equity.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have a decent stack. I don't need to take unnecessary risks, but this is a good spot to semi-bluff since both opponents showed weakness by checking.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should bet here as a semi-bluff. I have:\n1. Open-ended straight draw (8 outs roughly)\n2. Both opponents showed weakness by checking\n3. I can represent a strong hand (any 6, pocket pair, or Qx)\n4. Good fold equity against two players who checked\n\nA bet of around 18-24 chips (half pot to 2/3 pot) would be appropriate. This gives me fold equity while not risking too much of my stack.",

Very strong, especially on the button.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is the best position post-flop.\n3. **Opponents**: Both opponents appear tight. The SB has been very tight, folding most hands. The BB has also been tight but will defend their blind occasionally.\n4. **Stack Size**: I have a healthy stack (64.5 BB), so I can afford to play this hand aggressively.\n5. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1), which is fine but raising is better with this hand.\n\nWith KQs on the button against tight opponents, this is a clear raise. I want to:\n- Build the pot with my strong hand\n- Isolate one opponent\n- Take advantage of my position\n- Put pressure on the blinds\n\nGiven the minimum raise is 8 (2x BB), I should raise larger to get value and define the hand. A standard raise would be 3x BB = 12 chips. However, looking at the pattern:\n- Hand 23: SB raised to 12 (3x BB)\n- Hand 24: BB raised to 8 (2x BB when they were not in BB)\n\nI'll make a standard raise of 12 chips (3x BB) to build the pot and get value from my strong hand.",

It's not connected, not suited, and both cards are low. This is a clear fold in almost any situation.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG, which is the worst position (first to act). This means I'll be out of position against everyone else post-flop. From UTG, we need to play very tight.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 66 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack, I should preserve chips and wait for better spots. Playing 7-3 offsuit from UTG is -EV (negative expected value).\n\n5. **Opponent information**: I don't have specific reads on these opponents yet, but even against weak players, 7-3 offsuit from UTG is a fold.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 to win 6 (the pot), which is 1.5:1. But even with good pot odds, this hand is just too weak to play from early position.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. I should wait for a better hand and better position.\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools here - the decision is straightforward based on basic poker fundamentals. 7-3 offsuit from UTG is an automatic fold.\n\nLet me provide the response in the required JSON format.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- My position: SB (Seat 1)\n- My cards: Ts 8s (Ten of spades, Eight of spades) - suited connectors, but not very strong\n- My stack: 260 chips (65 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 30 chips\n- Amount to call: 8 chips\n- I need to call 8 into a pot of 30 (getting 3.75:1 odds)\n\n**Opponent Actions:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 - this is a 3x BB raise\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 12\n- Seat 5 folded\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Kimi-K2 has raised preflop multiple times (hands 7, 11, 12, 23, 27) with amounts varying from 6 to 24. This suggests they're active and potentially raising with a wide range.\n- MiniMax-M2 has only called small amounts (2 chips) in previous hands, suggesting they're more passive/calling station type.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Ts 8s is a marginal hand. It's suited and connected, which gives some potential, but it's easily dominated by higher cards. In SB vs a raise and a call, this is a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB, which is the worst position post-flop. I'll be first to act on every street.\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 to win 30, which is 3.75:1 odds. This is decent immediate odds, but the implied odds are questionable with this hand.\n\n4. **Opponent Ranges**: \n   - Kimi-K2 could be raising with a wide range given their history\n   - MiniMax-M2 calling suggests they have something, but their previous calls were for min-raises\n\n5. **Stack Preservation**: With 65 BB, I have a healthy stack. I shouldn't be risking chips with marginal hands out of position.\n\n6. **Multi-way pot**: This will be 3-way action, which decreases my chances of winning with a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Ts 8s is too weak to call a raise from the SB, especially when there's already a caller. I'm out of position with a hand that will often be dominated or miss the flop completely. The 8 chips to call might seem small, but it's 2 BB from the worst position with a marginal hand. I should preserve my stack for better spots.",

The small investment offers great potential upside against this unpredictable player. With position and favorable odds, set mining seems like the optimal strategy here.\n\nThe aggressive nature of my opponent means I could potentially win a substantial pot if I connect with the board. A standard raise might not be the most profitable move, as it could push out weaker hands or lead to a difficult decision if they 3-bet.\n\nMy stack depth and position provide flexibility to see the flop and assess the situation carefully. A set would give me a strong hand that could extract maximum value from this opponent's likely continuation betting tendencies.\n\nI'll complete the small blind and observe the flop, ready to capitalize on any favorable board texture.",

I have a low pocket pair that didn't improve\n2. **Position**: Good (I'm on the button)\n3. **Pot size**: Small (8 chips)\n4. **Stack preservation**: I'm deep-stacked (64 BB), so I don't need to take risks\n5. **Opponent tendency**: Aggressive, but has folded to pressure\n\n**Options**:\n- **Check**: Take a free card, see if I hit a set on the turn. This is safe and preserves my stack.\n- **Bet**: Try to take the pot down now. A small bet might get folds from hands that missed, but the board is scary for my opponent too. However, if I get called or raised, I'm in trouble.\n- **Fold**: Not an option since checking is free\n\n**Recommended action**: Check. This is the safest play. I have a weak hand, and there's no need to risk chips here. I can see a free card and hope to hit a set. If my opponent bets on the turn, I can re-evaluate. Checking also keeps the pot small with my marginal hand.\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to bet here... Actually, given that my opponent checked to me, they likely have a weak hand too. But betting with pocket fives on a K-high board is not a good idea - I'm either getting called by better hands or folding out worse hands. Checking is definitely the best play.",

The board shows K-6-8-3. There's a King on board, which is scary. I have:\n- No pair (5s vs K-6-8-3)\n- No straight draw\n- No flush draw\n- Essentially, I have 2 outs to hit a set (two more 5s in the deck)\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent actions from Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n- They checked on the flop, suggesting weakness\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 17-22, 24, 26)\n- When they do play, they can be aggressive (hand 23, 25, 27, 28)\n- In hand 28, they bet 20 on flop then raised to 80, showing they can be aggressive when they have something\n- They checked to me on the flop\n\n**Current situation:**\n- There's nothing to call (amount to call = 0)\n- I can check or raise\n- The opponent checked twice now (flop and implied check on turn since action is on me)\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I have a very weak hand - just 2 outs\n2. The board has a King which is very likely to be in opponent's range\n3. My opponent has shown they can be aggressive but checked twice\n4. Pot is small (8 chips)\n5. I'm in position (BTN)\n6. Tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack, no need to take unnecessary risks\n\n**Pot odds/implied odds:**\nIf I check and see the river for free, I have 2 outs from 46 unknown cards = ~4.3% chance to hit a set. That's not worth betting.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI should check here. I have a weak hand with no draw, and I can see the river for free. There's no value in betting as:\n- Better hands will call/raise\n- Worse hands will fold\n- I have no fold equity with such a weak hand\n\nThe opponent's check suggests weakness, but that doesn't mean I should bluff with 5 high. I should preserve my chips and see if I can hit a 5 on the river, or possibly bluff on the river if the opponent shows more weakness.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have pocket 5s with no pair on a K-6-8-3 board - just 2 outs to improve.

The final board is K-9-8-6-3.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 5s. I have a pair of fives.\n\nLet me analyze the action:\n- Preflop: I called 2 (as SB), opponent checked (as BB) - so we saw a cheap flop\n- Flop: Ks 6h 8d - I checked, opponent checked\n- Turn: 3s - I checked, opponent checked\n- River: 9h - I can check or bet\n\nThe opponent has checked to the river twice, showing weakness. Let me look at their history:\n\nFrom the opponent actions I recalled:\n- They fold a lot preflop (hands 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 26)\n- When they do play, they can be aggressive (hand 23 raise 12, hand 25 turn raise 72, hand 27 raise 12, hand 28 raise 12 and then raise 80 on flop)\n- They seem to play aggressively when they have something\n\nGiven that they checked the flop (K-6-8) and turn (3), and the river is a 9, they likely don't have:\n- A King (would have bet the flop)\n- A strong hand like two pair or set (would have bet earlier)\n- A straight (would have bet earlier)\n\nThe board is K-9-8-6-3. What hands could beat my 55?\n- Any pair 6s or higher (66, 77, 88, 99, KK)\n\n\n- Any two pair (Kx, 98, 86, etc.)\n- Any trips or better\n\nI'll carefully evaluate the bluffing opportunity.

Q2 offsuit is not a playable hand in most situations, especially from early position. From the button, it's still quite weak.\n\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - This is the best position post-flop, but we're still preflop. Position advantage doesn't compensate for a very weak hand.\n\n**Stack:** 264 chips (66 BB) - This is a healthy stack. I have room to play, but I shouldn't waste chips with weak hands.\n\n**Pot:** 6 chips (1.5 BB)\n\n**Action:** \n- Seat 2 posted SB (2 chips)\n- Seat 4 posted BB (4 chips)  \n- Seat 5 folded\n\nI need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Q2 offsuit is trash. Even from the button, this is a fold in almost all scenarios.\n2. **Pot odds:** I need to call 4 to win 6, so 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not enough to justify playing such a weak hand.\n3. **Opponents:** Seats 2, 4 are still to act after me if I call/raise. Seat 2 has 149 chips (shortish), Seat 4 has 293 chips (deep).\n4. **Tournament considerations:** With 66 BB, I should be selective and wait for better spots. I don't need to gamble with Q2.\n\nI don't need to use memory tools here - this is a straightforward fold. Q2 offsuit is simply not a playable hand, even on the button. The only consideration might be if the blinds were extremely tight and I could steal, but I have no information to suggest that, and it's still too weak.\n\nDecision: **FOLD**",

          "reasoning_content": "  Based on the observation data:\n\n1. **My hand**: 5c 2h - This is a very weak hand (5-2 offsuit), one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n2. **My position**: UTG (Under The Gun) - This is the worst position at the table, acting first preflop. This requires a very tight range.\n\n3. **My stack**: 264 chips (66.0 BB) - I have a healthy stack, no need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Opponent observations**:\n   - **MiniMax-M2** (Seat 4, SB): Has folded to many raises (hands 26, 27, 30), but did call a raise in hand 28 and played aggressively on the flop with T8s. Seems capable of aggression but folds to early position raises.\n   - **GPT-OSS-120B** (Seat 5, BB): Has folded a lot in these hands when facing raises. In hand 26 folded on BTN when facing a raise, in hand 27 folded BB to a raise, in hand 28 folded to a raise, in hand 29 folded SB, in hand 30 folded BTN. Seems quite tight.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack of 66 BB. There's no need to risk chips with a terrible hand from the worst position.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Need to call 4 chips to win 6, getting 1.5:1 odds. But with 5-2 offsuit from UTG, even these odds don't justify playing this hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. From UTG with 5-2 offsuit, this is an automatic fold regardless of opponent tendencies. The hand has no potential, I'm out of position, and I have no need to take risks with my healthy stack.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 7d 7s - Pocket sevens, a medium pocket pair\n**Position:** BB (out of position)\n**Stack:** 260 chips (65 BB)\n**Pot:** 10 chips\n**Action:** MiniMax-M2 called 4 chips from late position (Seat 4), everyone else folded\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nMiniMax-M2 has been relatively tight preflop:\n- Folded in hands 26, 27, 29, 30\n- Called in hand 28 (12 chips - likely defending blinds)\n- Called 2 chips in hand 31 then folded\n\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 is somewhat selective but not extremely tight. When they call preflop from late position, they could have:\n- Broadways (KQ, KJ, QJ, etc.)\n- Suited connectors\n- Medium pairs\n- Some weaker hands\n\n**Hand Strength:** Pocket 7s is a decent hand but vulnerable. Against a late position caller, I'm likely ahead of their range preflop, but post-flop it becomes tricky if overcards hit.\n\n**Position:** I'm out of position in BB, which is a disadvantage. I won't know what they'll do on later streets.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I can check for free since the amount to call is 0.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Checking allows me to see a flop for free with a medium pair\n2. Raising could take down the pot now or build a pot when I'm likely ahead\n3. Raising from OOP with a medium pair can be problematic - if I get called, I'll be in tough spots on overcard boards\n4. My stack is healthy at 65 BB, so I don't need to take unnecessary risks\n\n**Recommendation:** Check. I want to see a cheap flop with my pocket pair. If I hit a set (12% chance), I can potentially win a big pot. If not, I can easily fold to aggression. Raising now would commit more chips out of position with a hand that doesn't play well post-flop against a calling range.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the current hand:\n\nHand #32 - FLOP\nPosition: BB (Seat 1)\nCards: 7d 7s (pocket 7s)\nStack: 260 chips (65.0 BB)\nBoard: 8s 6s 5c\nPot: 10 chips\n\nAction: It's my turn on the flop, and I can check or raise.\n\nLet me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have pocket 7s. The board is 8s 6s 5c. This board is very coordinated and dangerous for pocket 7s:\n   - There are potential straights: 9-7, 7-9, 9-7-4, etc.\n   - There are potential flush draws with 3 spades\n   - My 7s are vulnerable to overcards and straight/flush draws\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB, which is out of position against MiniMax-M2 who is the only other active player.\n\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 is the only opponent remaining. Let me review their tendencies from the search results:\n   - Hand 22: Folded to a 3-bet\n   - Hand 23: Folded to a raise\n   - Hand 24: Raised preflop, bet on flop and got opponent to fold\n   - Hand 25: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 26: Folded to a raise\n   - Hand 27: Folded to a raise\n   - Hand 28: Called preflop, raised flop, then bet turn to get fold\n   - Hand 29: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 30: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 31: Called preflop, then folded to a raise\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems to be a relatively tight player who often folds to aggression. They have shown they can make continuation bets and value bets when they have position.\n\n4. **Current action**: Preflop, MiniMax-M2 just called 4 chips (limp). I checked in BB. Now on the flop, I can check or raise.\n\n5. **Board texture**: This is a wet, coordinated board with straight and flush draws. If MiniMax-M2 has any piece of this board (like a 9, 8, 6, 5, or spade draw), they could have a strong hand or strong draw.\n\n6. **My hand**: Pocket 7s on 8-6-5 board. I have an open-ended straight draw (need a 4 or 9 to make a straight), but I'm also vulnerable. Any 4 or 9 gives me a straight, but a 9 could also give someone a higher straight.\n\n7. **Pot size**: Only 10 chips, so it's a small pot. I should be careful about building a big pot here.\n\nGiven this analysis:\n- I have a medium-strength hand on a dangerous board\n- I'm out of position\n- My opponent is tight and likely to fold to aggression if they missed\n- The pot is small, so I should keep it that way\n\nI think checking is the best option here. I want to:\n1. See the turn card for free (or cheap)\n2. Pot control - don't bloat the pot with a marginal hand\n3. Let my opponent potentially bluff if they have nothing\n4. Avoid getting raised with my vulnerable hand\n\nIf I bet and get raised, I'd be in a tough spot. If I bet and they call, I'm out of position on the turn with a vulnerable hand. Checking keeps the pot small and gives me more information.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking pocket 7s on this coordinated 8s-6s-5c board for pot control.

The hand where they were aggressive (hand 28) they were betting and raising, which suggests they can play strong.\n\n**Pot odds**: \nNeed to call 6 to win 22 (16+6) = 27% equity needed. This is a very good price.\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: My 77 is an overpair but on a very dangerous board. It's more like a marginal made hand that needs protection.\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position, which is bad\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 can be aggressive, which is concerning on this board\n\n\n4. **Stack preservation**: I have a healthy 65 BB stack, don't need to take marginal spots\n\nI'll likely fold this hand. The board coordination and opponent's potential aggression make 77 too vulnerable. While pot odds are tempting, the risk of facing continued pressure on later streets outweighs the potential gain. Protecting my stack for better opportunities seems wisest, especially given my out-of-position disadvantage against an unpredictable opponent.\n\nThe bet sizing suggests multiple potential threats: possible straight draws, flush draws, or even a made straight. With only a modest investment of 4 chips preflop, cutting losses now prevents further chip erosion. My stack remains healthy at 65 BB, so preserving chips for more favorable situations makes strategic sense.",

It's suited and has good straight potential.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position in poker. I'll act last on every street postflop.\n\n3. **Opponent**: There's only one opponent left (Kimi-K2 in the BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They've been fairly passive (lots of checking)\n   - They folded preflop in hands 31 and 32\n   - They made a raise to 12 in hand 30\n   - They called then folded in hand 31\n   - Generally seems to play somewhat tight/passive\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 258 chips (64.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - BB has 147 chips (36.75 BB) - shorter stack\n   - We're playing tournament poker, so stack preservation matters but this is a good spot to accumulate chips\n\n5. **Action**: It's just 2 chips to call (half the big blind since I posted SB), so very cheap. But with a strong hand on the button against one opponent, I should be raising for value and to take control of the hand.\n\n6. **Raise sizing**: Minimum raise is to 8 (which would be 4 more chips). A standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 12 chips. Given opponent's tendency to fold preflop sometimes, I could raise to 12 to try to take it down now, or I could raise smaller to encourage a call.\n\nGiven my strong hand, position, and opponent's passive tendencies, I should raise. I'll go with a standard 3x raise to 12 chips. This builds the pot with a strong hand, puts pressure on the opponent, and gives me control of the hand.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 12,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Raising with premium Ace-Jack suited on the button.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n**My Hand:** Q\u2660 A\u2660 (Ace-Queen suited spades)\n**Position:** Button (BTN) - excellent position\n**Stack:** 264 chips (66 BB) - healthy stack\n**Pot:** 6 chips (2 from SB, 4 from BB)\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 145 chips\n- Seat 4 (BB): MiniMax-M2 with 291 chips\n\n**Actions so far:**\n- SB posted 2\n- BB posted 4\n- Seat 5 folded\n\n**Amount to call:** 4 chips (to match the BB)\n**Minimum raise:** 8 chips (2x the BB)\n\nLet me analyze the opponent tendencies based on the search results:\n\n**Kimi-K2 (SB, 145 chips):**\n- Hand 28: Raised to 12 (3x BB), bet 20 on flop, got raised and folded\n- Hand 31: Called 4, folded to a raise\n- Hand 25: Called 8 preflop, then check-folded on turn after facing aggression\n- Hand 23: Raised to 12, won the hand\n- Hand 16: Called 1 preflop, called flop bet, folded on turn\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (BB, 291 chips):**\n- Hand 28: Called 12 preflop, raised flop to 40, called 80 on flop, bet 107 on turn when opponent checked\n- Hand 32: Called 4 preflop, bet 6 on flop\n- Hand 24: Raised to 8 preflop, bet 4 on flop\n- Hand 31: Called 2 preflop, folded to raise\n- Hand 30: Folded to raise\n- Hand 26: Folded to raise\n- Hand 25: Folded preflop\n\n**Key observations:**\n\n1. **Kimi-K2** seems somewhat aggressive but can fold when facing pressure. They've made several raises but also folded when facing aggression.\n\n2. **MiniMax-M2** appears to be the most aggressive player at the table. They frequently raise preflop and continue aggression post-flop. They have the biggest stack (291 chips).\n\n3. **My hand** (AQs) is a premium hand, especially on the button. This is a clear raising hand.\n\n4. **Position:** I'm on the button, which is the best position in poker. I get to act last post-flop.\n\n5. **Stack sizes:** I have 264 chips (66 BB), which is a healthy stack. I can afford to play this hand aggressively.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** With blinds at 2/4 and my stack at 66 BB, I'm in a good spot. I should be looking to accumulate chips with premium hands.\n\n**Decision:** With AQs on the button, I should definitely raise. The question is how much.\n\nGiven:\n- MiniMax-M2 is aggressive and might call/3-bet\n- Kimi-K2 has a shorter stack (145 chips = 36 BB)\n- I want to build the pot with my premium hand\n- Standard raise size is 3x BB = 12 chips\n\nA raise to 12 chips (3x BB) is standard and appropriate here. It:\n1. Builds the pot with my strong hand\n2. Gives me control of the hand\n3. Puts pressure on the blinds\n4. Is a size that both opponents can call with weaker hands\n\nI should not just call (limp) because:\n- I'm giving up value with a premium hand\n- I'm letting the blinds see a cheap flop\n- I'm not taking advantage of my position\n\nI should not overbet because:\n- I want to keep worse hands in\n- A standard sizing is optimal\n\n**Final decision:** Raise to 12 chips (3x the big blind).",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 2h Ks (offsuit)\n- Position: Button (BTN) - good position\n- Stack: 264 chips (66 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- Action: I posted SB (2), BB posted 4, two players folded\n- Amount to call: 2 (to complete from SB to BB)\n- Minimum raise: 8\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent's actions (Kimi-K2 in seat 2), I can see:\n- They fold frequently preflop (hands 26, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36)\n- When they do play, they sometimes raise (hands 27, 28, 30)\n- They made a big raise of 72 on the turn in hand 25\n- In hand 28, they showed aggression with a bet of 20 and raise to 80 on flop, but then checked and folded on turn\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- K2o is a weak hand, especially offsuit\n- King is decent but 2 kicker is very weak\n- From SB position (effectively), this is a fold in most situations\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm on the Button but posted SB, so I'll act first postflop\n- This is not ideal - I'd rather have position throughout the hand\n- However, since it's heads-up against BB, position matters less\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Need to call 2 to win 6 (pot odds 3:1)\n- This is attractive pot odds, but with K2o, even these odds don't justify calling\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 66 BB\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Better to preserve chips for better opportunities\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. K2o is a trash hand, and even though I'm getting decent pot odds, the hand has very poor equity against any random hand the BB might have. The opponent seems to fold a lot preflop but can be aggressive when they play, so I don't want to get involved with such a weak hand. I should fold and move on.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand and the information I've gathered.\n\n## Current Situation\n- **My hand**: Kc 5h (King of clubs, 5 of hearts)\n- **My position**: BTN (Button) - great position\n- **My stack**: 264 chips (66 BB) - very healthy\n- **Blinds**: 2/4\n- **To call**: 4 chips\n- **Pot**: 6 chips\n\n## Opponents\n- **Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**: SB, 145 chips, posted 2\n- **Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)**: BB, 285 chips, posted 4\n- **Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)**: Folded\n\n## Hand Analysis\nK5o is a weak hand. It's not suited, the 5 kicker is very weak, and King-high hands can be problematic. However, I'm on the Button which is the best position in poker.\n\n## Opponent Tendencies (from observations)\nI found some information about MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):\n- Hand 28: Called a raise preflop, then made aggressive raises on flop and turn\n- Hand 29: Folded as SB with pocket 5s\n- Hand 30: Folded BTN after a raise\n- Hand 31: Folded after a raise\n- Hand 32: Called from CO, bet on flop\n- Hand 33: Folded SB\n- Hand 34: Folded BB to a raise\n- Hand 35: Folded UTG\n- Hand 36: Folded CO\n- Hand 37: Folded UTG\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 seems to fold quite often preflop, especially to raises. When they do enter pots, they can be aggressive post-flop.\n\nFor Seat 2 (Kimi-K2), I don't have direct observations, but they seem active.\n\n## Tournament Considerations\n- I have a very healthy stack (66 BB)\n- Blinds are relatively low at 2/4\n- I can afford to be selective\n- However, being on the Button gives me great position\n\n## Decision\nK5o is a marginal hand, but in position on the Button, it might be worth a steal attempt. However, I need to consider:\n\n\nI'll carefully evaluate the steal opportunity. The Button position offers strategic advantage, but the hand's weakness demands caution. Stealing could work given the opponents' tendencies, yet the risk of playing a weak hand out of position post-flop remains significant. My large stack provides flexibility, but maintaining chip discipline is crucial. The preflop dynamics suggest a potential opportunity to apply pressure, especially with one opponent already folding.\n\nThe optimal move appears to be a straightforward fold. Despite positional advantage, K5o's fundamental weakness makes it an unattractive stealing candidate. Preserving my strong stack for more promising situations seems the wisest strategic choice.",

While it has some potential (nut flush draw, wheel straight potential), it's very weak in terms of made hand strength.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (first to act) - This is the worst position. I have 5 players still to act behind me. From UTG, we should play very tight.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 264 chips (66 BB) - This is a decent stack, not desperate yet.\n\n4. **Opponents**: Looking at the opponent actions I recalled:\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 with 143 chips): Has shown folding tendencies, but also some calls and raises\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2 with 291 chips): Has folded a lot preflop, but also called and bet postflop\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B with 290 chips): Has made some preflop raises (12 chips)\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 66 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n6. **Hand strength from UTG**: A2s is typically a fold from early position. It's dominated by many better aces (AK, AQ, AJ, AT, A9, etc.), and even when we hit an ace, we're often behind. The flush potential is nice but we need to hit the flush to have a strong hand.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 6. That's 1.5:1 odds, which isn't particularly compelling for a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold from UTG with A2s. The hand is too weak to open from early position, and calling doesn't make sense either since we'd be playing out of position with a marginal hand. We should wait for better spots.",

Seems to be selective with raises.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Very tight, folds most hands. Only called in hand 38 when checked to, and bet small on flop.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** 8-5 offsuit is a trash hand. Very low chance of making a strong hand.\n2. **Position:** I'll be out of position postflop against two players.\n3. **Pot odds:** I need to call 8 to win 30, which is 3.75:1 pot odds. This might seem okay, but with this hand, it's not enough.\n4. **Implied odds:** Very low. Even if I hit something like two pair, I'm likely dominated by better hands.\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With a healthy 65 BB stack, I don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving my stack for better opportunities is key.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. I have a terrible hand, will be out of position, and there are already two players showing strength. The pot odds don't justify calling with such a weak hand. I should wait for a better spot.\n\nEven though I need to call only 8 chips, it's not worth investing in this hand with 8-5 offsuit from the SB against a raise and a call.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent GPT-OSS-120B has raised to 20 (2.5x BB) from the CO position (Seat 5). Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand:** Ks 9s - Suited King, but a weak kicker. This is a marginal hand, especially from SB.\n\n**My position:** SB - one of the worst positions, I'll be out of position postflop.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- Me: 256 chips (32 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent: 268 chips (33.5 BB) - similar stack size\n- BB (Seat 2): 109 chips (13.6 BB) - short stack\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has been very tight:\n- Raising preflop in hands 25, 31, 36 (amount 12 each time, which is 1.5x BB)\n- Folding most of the time (hands 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40)\n- When they do raise, they seem to give up on later streets (fold on flop in hand 24, fold on turn in hand 25)\n\nThis is a 2.5x raise (20 chips), which is larger than their usual 1.5x raises. This suggests a stronger hand range.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 16 chips to win 52 chips (20 raise + 4 SB + 8 BB + 20 from opponent). That's about 30.7% equity needed.\n\n**Analysis:**\n- K9s is not strong enough to call a raise from SB, especially out of position\n- The opponent appears tight and is raising larger than usual, suggesting strength\n- Being out of position postflop is a major disadvantage\n- I have a healthy stack and don't need to take marginal spots\n- The BB is short-stacked and might shove, creating additional risk\n\n\nI'll fold this hand. The combination of a weak starting hand, poor position, and opponent's tight-aggressive tendencies makes this an easy decision. The risk of facing a potential shove from the short-stacked big blind adds another layer of caution to this marginal situation.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket Kings (Ks Kc) on the Button, which is the second-best starting hand in Texas Hold'em. I'm in a great position (BTN) with a strong stack of 32 BB. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket Kings is a premium hand, only behind pocket Aces. I should definitely play this hand aggressively.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, the best position post-flop. This gives me position advantage throughout the hand.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 256 chips = 32 BB. This is a healthy stack. The small blind has 105 chips (13 BB) and the big blind has 321 chips (40 BB). I'm in good shape.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: Let me recall what I found about MiniMax-M2 (the BB):\n   - Hand #32: Called preflop with 77, then bet on flop\n   - Hand #33: Folded SB\n   - Hand #34: Folded BB to a raise\n   - Hand #38: Checked BB, then bet on flop\n   - Hand #40: Called a raise with 8c5h (very loose call), then bet and called on flop and turn\n   \n   MiniMax-M2 seems to play somewhat loose, calling raises with marginal hands and being aggressive post-flop. They've shown they can fold to aggression too.\n\n5. **Current Action**: Only the BB is left to act after me. The SB has folded, and I'm facing a call of 8 chips.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 32 BB, I have room to play, but I shouldn't be reckless. I want to build the pot with my premium hand while I have the advantage.\n\n**Decision**: I should raise. Pocket Kings plays best against fewer opponents, and raising will:\n- Build the pot when I likely have the best hand\n- Get value from worse hands\n- Potentially isolate against one opponent\n- Charge draws to see the flop\n\nGiven the opponent is in the BB and has shown they can call raises with marginal hands, I should make a solid raise. The minimum raise is 16, but I should raise more to:\n1. Build the pot\n2. Define my hand strength\n3. Make it expensive for speculative hands\n\nA standard raise would be 3x the big blind (24 chips), which is 3 BB. This is a good size - it's not too big that it only gets called by better hands, but it's big enough to get value and charge drawing hands.\n\nLet me raise to 24 chips.",

Wait, let me recalculate: They have 4 chips total, posted 4 as SB, so they have 0 left, but they raised to 105. This doesn't make sense mathematically. Let me reconsider...\n\nActually, looking at the data: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 4 chips\" and they \"post_sb 4\" and then \"raise 105\". This suggests they had at least 109 chips (4 for SB + 105 for raise). The stack display might be after posting or there's an error. Regardless, they're making a significant raise.\n\n2. **My hand**: KK is extremely strong. I'm only behind AA.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 81 to win a pot that will be 137 + 81 = 218. That's about 2.7:1 odds.\n\n4. **Tournament situation**: I'm in decent shape with 29 BB. This is a big pot that could significantly boost my stack.\n\n5. **Opponent's range**: Given their aggression and the size of the raise (105 into a pot of 24), they could have:\n   - Strong hands: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ\n   - Sometimes bluffs or weaker hands given their aggressive history\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\n\nFolding is out of the question with KK here. The question is call or raise.\n\n**Calling (81 chips):**\n- Pros: See the flop, keep the pot smaller if they have AA\n- Cons: Give them a chance to see 3 cards and potentially outdraw me\n\n**Raising:**\n- Minimum raise to 186 (which is 81 more than the call)\n- I could also go all-in for 232 total\n- This puts maximum pressure on them\n\nGiven that:\n- I have a premium hand (KK)\n- Opponent has shown aggression (could be wide range)\n- I'm in position\n- Tournament poker rewards aggression with strong hands\n- I want to maximize value and protect my hand\n\nThe best play is to **reraise (4-bet)**. Given my stack size and the opponent's aggressive action, I should make a significant raise. Since the minimum raise is to 186, and I have 232, I could either:\n- Raise to 186 (leaving me with 46 chips)\n- Go all-in for 232\n\nGoing all-in is cleaner and puts maximum pressure. It also ensures I realize my full equity if they call with worse.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider the opponent's stack. If they only have 4 chips shown, and they raised to 105, this is confusing. Let me assume they have more chips than displayed, or the display is post-action.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 4 chips\" but they posted SB of 4 and then raised to 105. This suggests the stack info might be outdated or there's an error. The key is they made a raise of 105.\n\nGiven the confusion about their stack, but seeing they can raise to 105, I'll assume they have at least that many chips. My all-in of 232 would be a significant overbet.\n\nLet me go with a strong raise to 186 (the minimum raise) which shows strength while not overcommitting if I'm somehow beat. Actually, wait - the minimum raise is 186 TOTAL, which means I need to put in 186 chips. Since there's 137 in the pot and I need to call 81, a raise to 186 means I'm raising by 105 (186 - 81 = 105 more than calling).\n\nActually, let me recalculate: The raise amount is the TOTAL amount I would put in.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I have pocket Kings (Ks Kc) - second best starting hand\n- Position: Button (good position)\n- My stack: 232 chips (29 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 137 chips\n- Amount to call: 81 chips\n- Minimum raise to: 186 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Action Sequence:**\n1. SB posts 4\n2. BB posts 8\n3. I (BTN) raise to 24\n4. SB raises to 105 (this is a 3-bet)\n5. BB folds\n6. Action back to me\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) is the SB who made a significant 3-bet to 105\n- They started with 4 chips shown, which is confusing since they raised to 105\n- This could be a display error or they have more chips\n- Their action: 3-bet from SB position after my BTN raise, which typically indicates strength\n\n**Decision Making:**\n\nWith pocket Kings in this spot:\n1. **Folding**: Absolutely not an option with KK after only facing one raise\n2. **Calling (81)**: \n   - Pros: See flop, keep pot smaller if they have AA\n   - Cons: Give them chance to outdraw, miss value\n3. **Raising**: \n   - Minimum raise is to 186 total (105 more than calling)\n   - I could also go all-in for 232\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nI have a premium hand and should play it aggressively. Given the opponent's 3-bet from SB, they likely have a strong range (AA, KK, QQ, JJ, AK, AQ). \n\nWith KK, I want to:\n- Get value from worse hands (QQ, JJ, AK, AQ)\n- Protect against hands that might outdraw me (AK, AQ)\n- Build a big pot with a strong hand\n\nThe best play is to **reraise (4-bet)**. Since my options are fold, call, or raise, I should raise. Given my stack size and the pot size, I could either raise to the minimum (186) or go all-in (232).\n\nGoing all-in for 232 makes sense because:\n- It maximizes pressure\n- It ensures I realize my equity\n- With 29 BB, this is a standard stack-off spot with KK\n- The opponent's 3-bet size suggests they have a hand that can call\n\nHowever, a raise to 186 is also reasonable as it shows strength while leaving some flexibility. But given tournament dynamics and the strength of KK, I think going all-in is better.\n\nWait, let me reconsider the opponent's stack. The display shows \"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 4 chips\" but they raised to 105. This is mathematically impossible unless the display is showing chips AFTER posting the SB or there's an error. Let me assume they have enough chips to make that raise.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll make a standard strong play: Go all-in with KK here.",

No suitedness, no connectivity, low cards.\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB, which is out of position postflop\n3. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called from what appears to be early position (based on seating)\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) completed from SB\n4. **Opponent tendencies from search results**:\n   - MiniMax-M2 has been fairly tight/passive based on the hands shown\n   - They've folded to raises multiple times\n   - In hand 40, they called a raise then bet flop and turn, showing aggression when they have something\n   - In hand 38, they bet on flop after checking preflop\n   - Generally seems to play straightforward\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- With 6-3 offsuit, I have very little equity against any reasonable range\n- I'm out of position postflop\n- The pot is small (24 chips)\n- MiniMax-M2 called from early position, suggesting they have something\n- There's no need to inflate the pot with such a weak hand\n- Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to see a free flop\n- Raising would be a pure bluff that would likely get called by Seat 4 given they voluntarily entered the pot\n- Folding is not an option since I can check for free\n\n**Conclusion**: The best play is to check and see a free flop. There's no value in raising with 6-3 offsuit, and since I can check for free, I should do so. If the flop hits me in some miraculous way (like 6-6-3 or a straight draw), I can proceed cautiously. Otherwise, I'll be ready to fold to any aggression.\n\nThe search results confirm MiniMax-M2 is capable of calling raises and playing postflop, so a bluff raise would be ill-advised. Checking is clearly the optimal play here.",

I have a healthy stack and don't need to take big risks\n\n**Decision:** I should check here. Betting with bottom pair into two players on a board with a flush draw is not profitable. If I bet and get called, I'm likely behind. If I bet and they fold, I win a small pot but risk being raised. Checking allows me to see a free turn card and pot control.\n\nThe pot is small (24 chips), so there's no need to inflate it with a marginal hand. Let me check and see what develops.",

Even with my weak kicker, I likely have enough equity against their range to call one street. Folding would be too tight given these odds and opponent's weak betting pattern.\"\n}\n```",
          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n**Hand details:**\n- My hand: 6s 3c (bottom pair)\n- Board: 3d 2s Qs\n- Position: BB\n- Stack: 357 chips\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- To call: 8 chips\n- Villain: MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: I have bottom pair (3s) with a 6 kicker. The board is dry except for the two spades giving a flush draw possibility. My hand is marginal but I do have a pair.\n\n2. **Opponent info**: Let me recall what I found about MiniMax-M2:\n   - Hand 28: Made a big turn bet of 107\n   - Hand 31: Called preflop then folded\n   - Hand 32: Called preflop then bet 6 on flop\n   - Hand 38: Checked preflop, bet 4 on flop\n   - Hand 40: Called preflop 12, bet 20 on flop and 20 on turn\n\n   Pattern: MiniMax-M2 is fairly active post-flop. When they bet small (like 4, 6, 8), it seems like a probe bet or weak continuation bet. They also make larger bets when they have stronger hands (20, 107).\n\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 40 (32+8), which is 5:1 or 20% equity needed. With bottom pair, I likely have more than 20% equity against a weak betting range.\n\n4. **Position**: I'm out of position which is bad, but the bet is small.\n\n5. **ICM/Tournament**: I'm in decent chip position. This is a low-risk call that could win me a decent pot.\n\n**Decision**: This is a close spot. The small bet size from MiniMax-M2 suggests weakness. \n\nWith bottom pair, I'm ahead of many bluffs and drawing hands. The pot odds are good (5:1). However, I'm out of position and my kicker is terrible.\n\nI think calling is the best option here. Folding is too tight given the pot odds and opponent's weak bet sizing. Raising would be overplaying my hand strength.",

Actually, I have 3-2 on board, so 4-5 would give me a straight, but I don't have either of those cards. So no real straight draw.\n\nActually, I have a pair of 3s with a 6 kicker. The board is 3d 2s Qs Ah. So I have bottom pair.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nMiniMax-M2 has been fairly aggressive. From the recall:\n- They bet on the turn in hand 28 (107 chips)\n- They bet on the flop in hand 32 (6 chips)\n- They bet on the flop and turn in hand 40 (20 chips each)\n\nThey seem to like betting, but the bet sizing on the flop was small (8 into 24 = 1/3 pot).\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 40, I checked, they can now bet. But I have the option to check. Since I have a free option to check, I should check.\n\n**Hand strength:**\n- I have bottom pair (3s)\n- Board has Q and A - very high cards\n- Possible flush draw with 2 spades on board\n- My 6 kicker is weak\n- If MiniMax bets here, they're representing an A, Q, or better\n\n**Position:**\nI'm out of position (BB) against MiniMax who is in middle position.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack (43.6 BB). No need to risk chips with a weak hand.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe action is on me and I can check for free. I should check here. I have a weak hand (bottom pair with bad kicker) and no real draw. The board is scary with an Ace and Queen. If MiniMax bets the turn, I'll likely need to fold unless it's a very small bet.\n\nLet me check.",

They bet with a wide range and put pressure on opponents.\n\nIn this hand:\n- They called preflop (could be wide range)\n- They bet 8 on flop after I checked (could be trying to take it down)\n- They checked back on turn (could be weak, giving up, or pot controlling)\n\n**My hand analysis**:\nI have bottom pair (3s) on a board with Q, A, and 7. This is very weak. The Ace is very scary for my pair of 3s. MiniMax could easily have:\n- Any Ace (they would have top pair)\n- Any Queen (they would have top pair)\n- Any 7 (they would have second pair)\n- Better 3 (3x) - unlikely but possible\n- Air/bluff\n\nGiven that they bet flop and checked turn, they might have:\n1. A weak hand that gave up\n2. A medium-strength hand pot controlling\n3. A monster slowplaying (less likely)\n\nIf I check, I get to showdown for free. If I raise, I'm turning my hand into a bluff. But what can I get them to fold?\n- They might fold weak pairs like 2s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 8s, 9s, Ts\n- They probably don't fold any Ace, Queen, or 7\n- They might fold some draws, but the board doesn't have many draws\n\nThe pot is 40 chips. A raise would need to be at least 8 more (minimum raise to 8 total, but that doesn't make sense - that would be less than the pot). Actually, wait - \"Minimum raise to: 8\" means I can raise TO 8 total, which would be a min-raise of 8 more (since the bet is currently 0). But that seems odd.\n\nLet me reconsider: The \"amount to call\" is 0, so the current bet is 0. The minimum raise would be to 8 (which is the big blind size). So I can check or raise to at least 8.\n\nIf I raise to 8, I'm betting 8 into a pot of 40. That's a very small bet (1/5 pot). It's unlikely to fold out anything decent.\n\n**Decision**: I have a weak hand (bottom pair) on a board with an Ace and Queen. My opponent is aggressive but checked the turn. I should check and go to showdown. Raising is unlikely to accomplish much and risks more chips with a marginal hand. Checking is free and I might win if they have nothing.\n\nLet me check my hand strength one more time:\n- Board: 3d 2s Qs Ah 7h\n- My hand: 6s 3c\n- I have pair of 3s with a 6 kicker\n- This is very weak, especially with an Ace on board\n\nChecking is clearly the best option.",

History shows they tend to bet when they have something (bet 20 on flop/turn in hand #40, bet 8 on flop in hand #43), but also fold preflop frequently. They've folded in 3 of the last 5 hands preflop.\n- **GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5)**: Small blind. They check on the flop now. History shows they fold preflop a lot, but have made some raises (20 and 24 chips). In hand #43, they called preflop, checked flop, then folded to a bet.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Both opponents checked to me\n- Amount to call is 0, so I can check for free\n- The pot is small (24 chips)\n- I have 377 chips (47 BB) - healthy stack\n\n**Decision:**\nI have complete air. There's no reason to bet here:\n1. My hand has 0% equity against any pair\n2. I have no draws or backdoor possibilities\n3. Both opponents have shown weakness by checking\n4. If I bet, I'd be bluffing with no equity and no fold equity against any pair\n5. Checking costs nothing and I can see if I improve on the turn (though it's very unlikely with a 3 and T)\n\nThe only consideration might be a bluff bet to try to take down the small pot, but with two opponents and a King on board, it's very likely at least one has a King or pair. Plus, I have zero equity if called.\n\n\nI should check and see if I get lucky on the turn, though with a 3 and T it's highly unlikely.

Just a 3 and a 10, with a board showing 8-2-K-5. No pair, no straight draw (would need a J and Q or 6 and 7), no flush draw. This is a complete air hand.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n\nFrom MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):\n- Folded preflop in hands 41, 42, 44, 45 (tight)\n- Called preflop and bet on flop in hand 43 (seems to bet when they have something)\n- In hand 40, they bet 20 on flop and turn (showing aggression)\n- Overall: Plays tight preflop, but bets when they enter pots\n\nFrom GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5):\n- Very tight preflop - folded in hands 37, 38, 39, 40, 42\n- Raised preflop in hands 41 and 44\n- Called preflop in hand 43 but folded on flop\n- Overall: Very tight player, only plays strong hands\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Both opponents checked on the flop and the turn (Seat 5 checked turn)\n- This suggests weakness from both players\n- The pot is small (24 chips)\n- I have nothing, but I am in position (acting last)\n\n**Options:**\n1. Check - Showdown with my high card 10 (likely losing)\n2. Bet (bluff) - Try to steal the pot\n\nGiven that both opponents have shown weakness by checking twice, and considering their tight tendencies, a small bluff might work here. However, I need to consider:\n\n- MiniMax has shown they can bet, so they might call or raise if they have any piece\n- GPT-OSS is very tight and likely folds without a strong hand\n- The board has a K, which is scary and might make them fold marginal hands\n\nWith my complete air hand, checking is the safe play. However, this is a tournament and I need to accumulate chips. A small bluff bet could take down this pot.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing: Minimum raise is 8 chips (to 16 total). The pot is 24, so a bet of around 16-20 chips would be a reasonable bluff size.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions more carefully: \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this means the minimum TOTAL amount I can put in is 8 chips (so a bet of 8). But that doesn't make sense given the pot is 24. Let me re-read...\n\n\"Amount to call: 0\" - so it's checked to me. \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this likely means minimum BET is 8 (to add to the existing pot).\n\nGiven I have nothing, but both opponents have shown weakness, and this is a tournament where I need to accumulate chips, I could make a small bluff here. However, the risk is that one of them might have a piece and call or raise.\n\nWith complete air on a K-high board, I think checking is the correct play. I have no equity, no draw, and while the opponents have shown weakness, bluffing with absolutely nothing is generally not profitable long-term, especially when I can see a free showdown with my 10-high (which might occasionally be good if both opponents have complete air too).\n\nLet me check again - the board is K-8-5-2. My 10-high is unlikely to be good at showdown. So checking is just giving up on the pot.\n\nBut wait - both players checked the flop AND the turn. This is a strong indicator of weakness. A small bet might take this down. In tournaments, you need to win these small pots.\n\nI think a small bluff of around 16-20 chips could be profitable here. Let me go with 16 chips (which would be a raise to 16 total).\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise again: \"Minimum raise to: 8\". Given the context and that the pot is 24, I think this might mean the minimum ADDITIONAL amount is 8 (so bet 8 chips). But that seems too small to be meaningful.\n\nLet me reconsider the format. When it says \"Minimum raise to: 8\", and the current pot is 24, I think it's saying the minimum total bet is 8 chips, which would be a very small bet. More likely, it's saying the minimum bet size is 8 chips.\n\nI'll interpret"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me reconsider this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have 3d Th (complete air)\n- Board: 8s 2h Kc 5d (K-high board)\n- Position: BB\n- Stack: 377 chips\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- Both opponents checked flop and turn\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Tight preflop, bets when they have something. They called preflop but checked twice.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Very tight, only plays strong hands. They posted SB, called preflop, but checked twice.\n\n**Decision:**\nBoth opponents have shown significant weakness by checking twice. This is a good spot for a bluff. The board has a King which is scary. A small bet could take this down.\n\nHowever, I have absolutely no equity. If I get called or raised, I'm done with the hand. But the pot is 24 chips, which is worth fighting for.\n\nGiven both opponents' tight/passive tendencies and the fact they've checked twice, I think a small bluff is profitable here. I'll bet about 2/3 pot (16 chips).\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Looking at the legal actions: \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this is confusing. If the pot is 24 and it's checked to me, I should be able to bet. The \"raise_to\" field suggests I need to specify the total amount I'm putting in.\n\nGiven the pot is 24 and it's checked to me, if I want to bet 16 chips, that would be a \"raise_to\" of 16 (total amount).\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The format says:\n- \"raise_to\": <number if raising, otherwise null>\n- \"You can only raise if 'raise' is in your legal_actions\"\n\nSince \"raise\" is in my legal_actions, I can bet. If I want to bet 16 chips, I would set \"raise_to\": 16.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Usually in poker notation, \"raise to\" means the total amount. So if the current bet is 0 (checked to me), and I want to bet 16, I would be raising to 16.\n\nLet me go with a conservative approach. Both opponents are tight and have shown weakness. A small bluff is appropriate. I'll bet 16 chips (about 2/3 pot).\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. Looking at the hand history:\n- Seat 5 posted SB of 4\n- Seat 1 (me) posted BB of 8\n- Seat 4 called 8\n- Seat 5 called 4 (completing the call)\n- I checked\n\nSo the pot should be: 8 (my BB) + 8 (Seat 4 call) + 8 (Seat 5 call) = 24. That matches.\n\nNow on the turn, it's checked to me. I can check or bet. If I want to bet, I need to \"raise\" since I'm increasing the bet from 0.\n\nIf the minimum raise is 8, that means the minimum BET is 8 chips. So I could bet anywhere from 8 to my entire stack.\n\nGiven I have complete air, but both opponents have shown weakness, I think a small bluff of 16 chips is appropriate. This is about 2/3 pot and should be enough to get folds from marginal hands.\n\nLet me make a decision: I'll bet 16 chips as a bluff.",

They checked to me on this flop, which could mean:\n1. They missed the flop\n2. They have a marginal hand and want to see a free card\n3. They're trapping with a strong hand\n\n**My History:**\nLooking at my recent hands, I've been playing relatively tight. I won a big pot with pocket Kings in hand 42, and have won a few smaller pots. My win rate is about 24% which is reasonable.\n\n**Decision:**\nWith Ace-high on a Q-9-7 board, I have a very weak hand. Even though I'm in position and it checks to me, betting here would be a pure bluff. Given that:\n\n\nI see a potential showdown scenario with limited upside. The opponent's tight-aggressive tendencies suggest they'll likely call or re-raise with any decent hand. Checking provides a risk-free way to gather more information and potentially see a free card that could improve my hand. The tournament context emphasizes preserving chips over speculative bluffs, making a cautious approach more prudent.\n\nWhile Ace-high might occasionally win at showdown, the risks of betting outweigh the potential rewards. Checking allows me to control the pot size and avoid unnecessary chip exposure against an opponent who tends to play strong hands aggressively.\n\nI'll carefully evaluate the turn card's impact on potential draws and hand strength before making any further decisions.",

Check - see a free river card\n2. Bet - try to take down the pot now\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- I only have Ace-high on a coordinated board\n- My opponent checked twice, suggesting weakness\n- I have position advantage\n- The pot is small (16 chips)\n- I could try a small stab at the pot to see if I can take it down\n- However, if I get called, I'm likely behind\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to bet when they have something, and they've checked twice, they likely have a weak hand. A small bet could take down the pot. However, with my weak hand and the coordinated board, checking might be safer to avoid getting involved in a big pot with Ace-high.\n\nI think checking is the better play here. I don't have enough equity to bet for value, and a bluff might not work against this opponent who seems to call when they have something. Checking preserves my stack and gives me a free chance to hit an Ace on the river.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The opponent checked the flop and now the action is on me on the turn. Wait, I need to re-read the action...\n\nLooking at the actions:\n- flop: Seat 1 check (that's me)\n- flop: Seat 4 check (that's MiniMax-M2)\n- Now it's turn, and I need to act\n\nSo the opponent checked the flop, and now it's on me to act on the turn. The \"Amount to call: 0\" means there's no bet to call yet - it's my action.\n\nGiven that the opponent checked the flop, they likely have a weak hand. This is a good spot for a small bluff bet to try to take down the pot. A bet of around 8-12 chips (half pot to 3/4 pot) would be appropriate.\n\nBut wait, I only have Ace-high. Let me think about the board texture again:\n- 7s 9d Qh 8s - this is very coordinated\n- Any T makes a straight (J-T or T-6)\n- Any J makes a straight (J-T)\n- Flush draw is possible\n- My Ace-high is very weak here\n\nIf I bet and get called, I'm likely behind. If I check, I get a free card to possibly hit an Ace.\n\nGiven my weak hand and the coordinated board, I should check. I'm not confident enough in a bluff here, and checking is the safer play that preserves my stack.\n\nActually, you know what - let me reconsider one more time. The opponent checked the flop from the BB after I just called preflop. This is a very weak action. On a board like this, if they had any piece or a decent draw, they'd likely bet. The fact that they checked suggests they have complete air.\n\nThis is actually a good spot for a small bluff bet. I should bet around 8-12 chips to try to take it down. If they call, I can give up on the river unless I improve.\n\nLet me go with a small bet of 12 chips (3/4 pot).",

They checked on the flop, suggesting weakness.\n\n**Current Action:**\nBoth players checked on the flop. This suggests:\n1. Opponent likely has a weak hand or marginal holding\n2. They could have a draw they're checking\n3. They might have a strong hand but are trying to trap (less likely with this board)\n\n**My Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card, see the river.

If they have any pair, I lose.\n- If they have Ace-high with a better kicker, I lose.\n- The only hands I beat are pure bluffs or missed draws.\n- They called on the turn, which suggests they had something.\n- With 3 spades on board, any spade in their hand beats me (flush).\n- The risk vs reward: Pot is 40, I could try to bluff, but I'm out of position and they've shown some strength by calling turn.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 381 chips (47.6 BB) - healthy stack\n- Don't need to take unnecessary risks\n- Checking is free and costs me nothing\n\nI think checking back is the smart play here.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: 7h Th (7\u2665 T\u2665) - This is a suited connector, which has some potential but is not a premium hand.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position at the table. I act last on every street postflop.\n\n**Stack**: 381 chips (47.6 BB) - This is a healthy stack, giving me plenty of room to maneuver.\n\n**Blinds**: 4/8 - So I'm in a tournament with increasing blinds.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 301 chips, in SB\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 292 chips, in BB\n\nLet me analyze the opponent tendencies:\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (SB)**:\n- Has folded preflop many times (hands 39, 41, 42, 44, 45)\n- When they do play, they tend to call or bet (hands 40, 43, 46, 47)\n- On hand 40: called preflop, then bet flop and turn\n- On hand 43: called preflop, bet flop, then checked turn and river\n- On hand 46: called preflop, checked flop, folded turn\n- On hand 47: checked preflop (was BB), checked flop, called turn, checked river\n- Seems to be a relatively passive player who calls more than raises\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B (BB)**:\n- Has raised preflop several times (hands 31, 36, 41, 44) with amounts like 12, 20, 24\n- Folds frequently (hands 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42)\n- On hand 43: called 4, checked flop, then folded\n- On hand 46: called 4, checked flop and turn, then folded turn\n- Seems to be an aggressive player who raises with good hands but folds to pressure\n\n**Current situation**:\n- I have 7h Th on the button\n- It's folded to me\n- SB has posted 4, BB has posted 8\n- I need to call 8 to see the flop\n- I can raise to at least 16\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 7h Th is a suited connector. It's not strong enough to raise for value, but it has good potential if I hit a straight or flush. It's definitely playable from the button.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is a huge advantage. I'll act last postflop, which gives me more information and control.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents seem to fold fairly often. GPT-OSS-120B in the BB has shown aggression when they have strong hands but also folds a lot. MiniMax-M2 in the SB is more passive.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 12 (4+8). I need to call 8 to see the flop. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, which isn't great, but position and implied odds matter more here.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 47.6 BB, I have a comfortable stack. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands from good position.\n\n**Decision**: I should call. Here's why:\n- From the button, I can play more hands profitably\n- 7h Th has good potential for straights and flushes\n- Both opponents have shown they can fold, so I may be able to steal pots postflop\n- Raising would be too aggressive with this hand strength - I don't want to bloat the pot with a marginal hand\n- Calling keeps the pot small and allows me to see the flop cheaply from position\n\nI could consider raising as a steal attempt, but the BB (GPT-OSS-120B) has shown they can raise preflop and might defend their BB. Since I have a marginal hand, it's better to just call and see the flop.\n\nLet me call 8 and see what happens on the flop.",

I have 7h Th which gives me:\n- No pair\n- Backdoor flush draw (hearts)\n- No straight draw\n- Only high card T\n\nThis is a very weak hand on this board. The board is paired which reduces the value of draws and makes it more likely someone has trips or a full house.\n\nLooking at the action:\n- Preflop: I called 8 chips on the button with 7h Th (reasonable speculative hand in position)\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) folded from SB\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) checked in BB\n- On the flop, GPT-OSS-120B checked to me\n\nFrom the opponent history I retrieved:\nGPT-OSS-120B has been fairly passive:\n- Frequently folds preflop\n- When they do see flops, they tend to check and often fold later\n- They check-called preflop in hand 43 then check-folded on flop\n- They check-called preflop in hand 46, checked flop and turn, then folded turn\n\nThis suggests they're playing a relatively tight/passive style.\n\nWith my stack of 373 chips (46.6 BB) and the pot being only 20 chips, I should:\n1. Check behind and see a free turn card - I have some backdoor equity\n2. Consider a small bluff bet, but the paired board is dangerous for bluffing\n3. The opponent's passivity suggests they might have missed this flop too\n\nThe best play here is likely to check. I have position, a weak hand, and a passive opponent. I can:\n- Take a free card to try to improve\n- Pot control with my weak holding\n- Re-evaluate on the turn\n\nIf I bet, I risk getting called by any Jack, any 4, or any pocket pair. The board is scary enough that a bluff might not work, and I don't need to protect anything.\n\nChecking seems like the optimal play here.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 7h Th (7 of hearts, 10 of hearts)\n- Board: Jh Jc 4s 3s (Jack of hearts, Jack of clubs, 4 of spades, 3 of spades)\n- Pot: 20 chips\n- My stack: 373 chips (46.6 BB)\n- Position: BTN\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- The board has two Jacks, making it paired\n- I have a 7 and a 10, both hearts\n- There are 3 spades on the board (4s, 3s, plus the Jh is a heart not spade)\n- Wait, let me recount: Jh (hearts), Jc (clubs), 4s (spades), 3s (spades) - so 2 spades, not 3\n- No straight draws possible with my hand\n- No flush draw (I have hearts, board has spades)\n- My best hand is just high card 10 (since the board is paired Jacks)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's turn actions from the recall:\n- They frequently bet on the turn (hands 1, 2, 6, 10, 18)\n- They've also checked and folded (hands 8, 25, 46)\n- They seem to be an active player who bets frequently\n\n**Current Action:**\n- Preflop: I called 8 from BTN\n- Flop: Both checked\n- Turn: Opponent checked to me\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak - just high card 10 on a paired board\n2. **Position**: Good (on the button)\n3. **Pot size**: Small (20 chips)\n4. **Opponent's check**: Could be weakness or a trap\n5. **My stack**: Healthy at 46.6 BB\n6. **Board texture**: Paired board with potential straight draws (A-5, 5-6, etc.) and flush draw (spades)\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: Free card to see if I improve on river. Low risk.\n- **Bet**: Try to steal the pot. But what would I represent? A Jack? With my preflop call and flop check, betting now would look suspicious.\n- **Fold**: Too weak, and I have a free option to check.\n\n**Opponent's likely range**:\nSince they checked the turn after checking flop, they likely have:\n- Weak made hands (pocket pairs below J, Ace-high)\n- Draws (straight draws, flush draws)\n- Complete air\n\n**My decision**: This is a good spot to try a small bluff. The board is paired which reduces the number of strong hands opponent can have. They've shown weakness by checking twice. I can represent having a Jack or a strong hand that was slowplaying.\n\nHowever, looking at my actual hand, I have very little equity if called. And the pot is small - risking chips to win 20 might not be worth it.\n\nLet me reconsider: The opponent checked the turn. If I bet, I need to size it appropriately. Minimum raise is 8, which would be 8 to win 20 (2.5:1 pot odds for opponent). That's a decent bluff size.\n\nBut wait - I have position and a free card. The risk/reward of checking is better. If I check and the river is a heart, I might pick up a flush draw (though still weak). If the river pairs the board or brings a scare card, I might be able to bluff then.\n\nActually, given that I have no real equity and the opponent has been active, checking is the safer play. I can reevaluate on the river.",

The lack of aggression indicates they might be holding a marginal hand or completely missed the board. \n3. **Strategic Position**: From the button, I have positional advantage. This allows me to potentially steal the pot with a well-timed bluff.\n4. **Risk vs. Reward**: A small bet could potentially win the 20-chip pot, but it carries the risk of being called by a better hand.\n\nThe opponent's passive play and my positional advantage create an interesting bluffing opportunity. However, the board texture and my complete lack of hand strength make this a risky proposition. I'll need to carefully weigh the potential gain against the likelihood of being called.\n\nChecking seems the most prudent move, preserving my stack while avoiding unnecessary risk. The potential reward doesn't justify the gamble with such a weak hand.",

It's suited (spade) but not connected (8 and 10 with a gap). This is:\n- Not a premium hand\n- Some potential to make straights or flushes\n- Better in position (which I am - on the button)\n- Good for stealing blinds\n\n**Opponent Analysis - MiniMax-M2:**\nFrom the opponent actions I just recalled:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been folding preflop quite frequently (hands 41, 42, 44, 45, 48, 49)\n- When they do call preflop, they tend to bet on the flop (hands 40, 43)\n- They seem to be playing somewhat tight/passive\n- They check a lot on later streets\n\n**Position and Stack:**\n- I'm on the BTN, which is the best position post-flop\n- I have a healthy stack (49 BB)\n- This is a good spot to try to steal the blinds with a marginal hand\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Need to call 4 to win 12 (3:1 odds)\n- This is good for seeing a flop, but with my marginal hand, I might prefer to either steal or fold\n\n**Decision:**\nWith a marginal hand like 8s Th in position, and facing a tight opponent who folds frequently, this is a perfect spot for a steal attempt. Raising to 16 (2x BB) is a standard steal size. If they call, I have position and can evaluate the flop.\n\nLet me consider the options:\n1. Fold: Too tight, I'm giving up too much equity in position\n2. Call: I could call and see a flop, but with a marginal hand I'd prefer to take it down preflop or have initiative\n3. Raise: Steal attempt. 16 chips is a good size - it's the minimum raise which is enough to put pressure on the BB.\n\nI think raising is the best play here.",

That's 8 outs (4 sixes and 4 queens). \n\n**Pot**: 32 chips\n**Stack**: 381 chips (47.6 BB)\n**Position**: Button\n**Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 in BB with 285 chips\n\n**Action so far**: \n- Preflop: I raised to 16 from SB (button), BB called 8 more\n\n**Current situation**: It's checked to me, I can check or bet.\n\nLet me analyze what I learned about MiniMax-M2:\n- From the recall data, MiniMax-M2 tends to fold preflop quite a bit (hands 41, 42, 44, 45, 48, 49)\n- When they do call preflop and bet on the flop (hands 40, 43), they make small bets (20 and 8 respectively)\n- They sometimes check-call or check-fold later streets\n- They seem to be a relatively straightforward, somewhat tight player\n\n**My straight draw**: I have 8 outs out of 47 unknown cards = ~17% chance to hit on the turn. With implied odds, this could be profitable.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the button, which is great. I have the betting lead.\n\n**Decision**: I should consider betting here because:\n1. I have a strong draw (open-ended straight)\n2. I have position\n3. I was the preflop aggressor, so a continuation bet makes sense\n4. If I check, I give a free card and lose initiative\n5. A bet can fold out some better hands or get value from worse draws\n\nHowever, I need to be careful because:\n- The board has a flush draw (spades) that I don't have\n- If MiniMax-M2 has a strong hand, they may check-raise\n\nGiven my stack size (47.6 BB) and the pot size (32), I should make a standard continuation bet of about 1/2 to 2/3 pot, which would be 16-21 chips. Let me bet around 16-20 chips to keep the pot manageable but apply pressure.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions, the minimum raise to is 8, but that's the minimum additional bet. Since the pot is 32, a proper c-bet would be more like 16-20. Let me bet 16 chips, which is half pot and also matches my preflop raise size.",

If I check, I get to see the river for free.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: I have a straight, which is very strong. However, there's a potential flush draw on board (3 spades). If the river comes another spade, I could lose to a flush.\n\n2. **Opponent's range**: Given their passive play and that they called my flop bet, they could have:\n   - A made hand (pair, two pair, set)\n   - A draw (flush draw, straight draw)\n   - A weaker made hand that they're calling with\n\n3. **Position**: I'm in position (BTN), which is good. I get to act last.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 333 chips, opponent has 237 chips. The pot is 128, so it's getting significant relative to stacks.\n\n5. **Betting pattern**: I bet the flop and they called. This suggests they have something. They could have a J, a 9, a T, a draw, or possibly already have a flush.\n\n**Decision**:\nI have a strong hand (straight), but the board is dangerous with a flush draw. I should bet for value and protection. I want to:\n1. Get value from worse hands (pairs, two pairs, sets, weaker straights)\n2. Charge draws to continue\n3. Potentially get all-in if they have a strong hand\n\nGiven the pot is 128 and they have 237 chips left, a good sizing would be around 2/3 pot to pot-sized bet. Let's say 96-128 chips.\n\nSince the minimum raise is 48, but I want to bet more for value and protection. I should bet around 96 chips (3/4 pot) to charge flush draws and get value from worse made hands.\n\nActually, looking at the betting again - I bet 48 on flop, they called. Pot is now 128. I should continue betting for value. A bet of 96 seems appropriate.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The amount to call is 0, so I can check. But I should bet for value. The minimum raise to value is 48, but that's too small. I want to bet more like 80-96.\n\nLet me think about the exact amount. If I bet 96:\n- Pot becomes 224\n- They have 237-48 = 189 left (they called 48 on flop from starting stack of 237)\n- Actually, wait: They started with 237, called 8 preflop, so 229 left. Then called 48 on flop, so 181 left.\n\nIf I bet 96 and they call, pot becomes 128+96+96 = 320, and they have 85 left. Then river would be easy to get all-in.\n\nIf I bet 80, pot becomes 128+80+80 = 288, they have 101 left.\n\nI think betting 80 is a good size - it's a substantial value bet that charges draws but doesn't necessarily commit them if they have a weak hand.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully. I have a straight. The board has 3 spades. I have the 8s, so if another spade comes, I have a straight flush draw but would lose to any made flush.\n\nThe key is: should I bet or check? I think betting is correct for value and protection. The question is how much.\n\nGiven the pot is 128, and stacks are relatively shallow now, I should bet around 2/3 pot or more. Let's"

If I check, I get to see the river for free.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: I have a straight, which is very strong. However, there's a potential flush draw on board (3 spades). If the river comes another spade, I could lose to a flush.\n\n2. **Opponent's range**: Given their passive play and that they called my flop bet, they could have:\n   - A made hand (pair, two pair, set)\n   - A draw (flush draw, straight draw)\n   - A weaker made hand that they're calling with\n\n3. **Position**: I'm in position (BTN), which is good. I get to act last.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 333 chips, opponent has 237 chips. The pot is 128, so it's getting significant relative to stacks.\n\n5. **Betting pattern**: I bet the flop and they called. This suggests they have something. They could have a J, a 9, a T, a draw, or possibly already have a flush.\n\n**Decision**:\nI have a strong hand (straight), but the board is dangerous with a flush draw. I should bet for value and protection. I want to:\n1. Get value from worse hands (pairs, two pairs, sets, weaker straights)\n2. Charge draws to continue\n3. Potentially get all-in if they have a strong hand\n\nGiven the pot is 128 and they have 237 chips left, a good sizing would be around 2/3 pot to pot-sized bet. Let's say 96-128 chips.\n\nSince the minimum raise is 48, but I want to bet more for value and protection. I should bet around 96 chips (3/4 pot) to charge flush draws and get value from worse made hands.\n\nActually, looking at the betting again - I bet 48 on flop, they called. Pot is now 128.

Then river would be easy to get all-in.\n\nIf I bet 80, pot becomes 128+80+80 = 288, they have 101 left.\n\nI think betting 80 is a good size - it's a substantial value bet that charges draws but doesn't necessarily commit them if they have a weak hand.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully.

Let me go with 80 chips as a solid value bet that charges draws but doesn't overcommit against a potential made flush.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider the bet sizing. The pot is 128. If I bet 80 (roughly 2/3 pot):\n- Opponent has to call 80 to win 208 (128+80), getting about 2.6:1 odds\n- This is about right for a flush draw (needs 4:1 odds, but they have implied odds)\n\nIf I bet 96 (3/4 pot):\n- Opponent gets about 2.3:1 odds\n- Better for charging draws\n\nGiven the opponent is passive and tends to call with weaker hands, I should bet for value. I'll bet 96 to charge the flush draw more heavily while still getting called by worse.\n\nBut actually, thinking about it more - with a straight on a 3-flush board, I want to get value but also protect. Betting around 2/3 pot (80-85) seems right.\n\nLet me go with 80 chips. It's a solid value bet that:\n1. Gets value from worse hands (pairs, two pairs, sets, weaker straights)\n2. Charges flush draws appropriately\n3. Doesn't overcommit if they have a made flush\n4. Sets up a river shove if they call\n\nActually, I just realized - if I bet 80 and they call, pot becomes 288, they have 101 left. On the river, I can comfortably shove for value.\n\nIf they raise, I need to be concerned about a made flush or possibly a higher straight (but Q-K would be the only higher straight possible, which is unlikely given the betting).\n\nI'll bet 80 for value and protection.",

Seems to be a somewhat tight/passive player.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Very passive, has folded preflop multiple times (hands 47, 49, 50), and when they do see flops, they're checking through. Very tight/passive.\n\nWith 8-3 offsuit, this is one of the worst starting hands in poker. Even in position, this is an easy fold. The hand has:\n- No high card value\n- No suitedness\n- No connectivity (gap of 5 cards)\n- Very low potential to make strong hands\n\nGiven I'm on the button, I could theoretically try to steal with any two cards against weak opponents, but 8-3 offsuit is just too weak. Even if both opponents fold 70% of the time, the risk/reward isn't worth it with this hand.\n\nThe pot is only 12 chips (1.5 BB), so there's not much to fight for. Better to preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nDecision: FOLD",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand**: 9c 2s - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected with a gap. This is typically a folding hand in almost all situations.\n\n**Position**: BB (Seat 1) - I'm in the worst position post-flop.\n\n**Stack**: 453 chips (56.6 BB) - Healthy stack, no pressure.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Pot: 24 chips\n- SB posted 4, I posted BB 8, Seat 4 called 8, Seat 5 called 4\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\nSo the action is back to me after Seat 4 called and Seat 5 called. I can check for free.\n\nLet me think about what to do:\n1. **Hand strength**: 9c 2s is trash. Very low equity against any reasonable calling range.\n2. **Pot odds**: I can check for free, so checking gives me infinite pot odds to see the flop.\n3. **Position**: I'll be out of position post-flop, which is bad.\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called from MP with 225 chips (28 BB) - short stack\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called SB with 284 chips (35.5 BB) - also somewhat short\n\nSince I can check for free, I should check. Raising would be terrible with this hand - I'd be building a pot with a weak hand out of position. Folding is possible but unnecessary since checking is free and I have some chance to hit a miracle flop (though very unlikely).\n\nI should check and see the flop. This is a clear check situation.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - with 9-2 offsuit, even checking might not be great because:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. I have very little chance to improve to a strong hand\n3. If I hit a 9, I'll often be dominated by better 9s\n\n\n4. If I hit a 2, same issue\n\nI'll play cautiously and check, hoping for an unexpected favorable flop despite the hand's inherent weaknesses. The free opportunity to see the flop minimizes my risk while preserving a slim chance of improvement.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 9c 2s (very weak hand, no pair, no draw)\n- Board: 7c 7h Js (paired board with a Jack)\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- I need to call 40 chips\n- Position: BB\n\n**Opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) behavior:**\nFrom the recalled actions, I can see that GPT-OSS-120B has been very passive:\n- Multiple checks and folds\n- Very conservative play\n- In hand #46, they checked twice then folded on turn\n- In hand #48, they checked through all streets\n- They folded preflop in hands #47, #49, #50\n\nThis is a significant bet from a normally passive player (40 chips into 64 pot = 62.5% pot bet).\n\n**My hand analysis:**\n- 9c 2s is complete trash\n- Board is 7-7-J\n- I have no pair, no draw, no flush draw, no straight draw\n- Even if opponent is bluffing, I have very little equity\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- To call: 40 chips\n- Getting 64:40 or 1.6:1 odds\n- Need ~38% equity to break even\n- I likely have <10% equity with 9-high\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 453 chips (56.6 BB) - healthy stack\n- This is not a situation to risk chips\n- Even against a passive player making an unusual bet, I have no hand to continue with\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite the opponent being normally passive, I have absolutely nothing with 9-high on a 7-7-J board. The bet sizing suggests strength (or at least a legitimate attempt to win the pot). Even if they're bluffing, I have no showdown value and would be drawing nearly dead. This is an easy fold.\n\nI should not try to get creative here - I have a trash hand and should preserve my chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: A\u2660 5\u2660 - Ace-five suited. This is a decent speculative hand, especially from the button position. I have a suited ace which gives me nut flush potential and can make strong top pair hands.\n\n**Position**: BTN (button) - This is the best position in poker. I get to act last postflop, which gives me a significant advantage.\n\n**Stack**: 449 chips (56.1 BB) - This is a healthy stack. I have room to play postflop poker.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): 233 chips - This player has been relatively tight. They folded preflop in hands 48, 49, 51, and raised in hand 53. They called in hands 50 and 52 but folded on later streets. This suggests they're somewhat cautious.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): 292 chips - This player seems passive, making lots of checks and folds. They only called in hand 52 and made one bet on the flop in that hand. They folded in hand 53 after calling preflop.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to win 12 chips (1.5:1 odds). This is reasonable for a speculative hand like A5s from the button.\n\n**Strategic considerations**:\n1. With A5s on the button, this is a clear raise or call situation\n2. Given my position advantage and the passive nature of both opponents, I should be looking to steal the blinds or play a pot in position\n3. A5s has good playability postflop - can make nut flushes, straights, and top pair hands\n4. Both opponents appear to be somewhat tight/passive based on their recent actions\n\n**Decision**: I should raise here. Here's why:\n- I have position advantage\n- My hand has good speculative value\n- Both opponents have shown tendencies to fold or play passively\n- Raising gives me initiative and can win the pot preflop\n- Even if called, I have a hand that plays well postflop in position\n\nA standard raise would be to about 3x the big blind, so 24 chips total. Since the minimum raise is 16, I can raise to 24. This is a good size that puts pressure on the blinds while not risking too many chips.\n\nLet me raise to 24 chips.",

This is a marginal hand.\n- The board is 9h 3s 6h - there are potential flush draws and straight draws.\n- My 9 is vulnerable to overcards and better 9s.\n- The 5 kicker is very weak.\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 48: checked flop, turn, river (passive)\n- Hands 49-50: preflop folds\n- Hand 52: called preflop 4, then bet 40 on flop (big bet)\n- Hand 53: called preflop 8, then folded (showing some selectivity)\n- Hand 54: preflop fold\n\nThe opponent seems to bet big when they have something (40 chip bet in hand 52), but they also check a lot. Their current bet is only 8 into a 32 pot (1/4 pot), which is a weak/small bet.\n\n**My Recent Play:**\n- Hand 50: Won with 8s Th (was aggressive with raises and bets)\n- Hand 52: Folded BB with 9c 2s on 7c 7h Js board\n- Hand 54: Won with As 5s preflop raise\n\n**Position and Stack:**\n- I'm in BB position\n- I have a healthy stack of 56.6 BB\n- Pot is 32, bet to call is 8 (getting 4:1 odds)\n\n**Decision:**\nI have bottom pair with a weak kicker. The board has potential draws. The opponent's small bet suggests weakness or a draw. However, my hand is marginal and vulnerable.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold - too weak given the small bet and pot odds\n2. Call - getting 4:1 odds, but could be facing better hands/draws\n3. Raise - could take down the pot now, but would commit chips with a weak hand\n\nGiven the small bet size (8 into 32 pot), I think calling is reasonable. I'm getting good odds and the opponent's betting pattern suggests they could be weak. However, I need to be careful on later streets.\n\nLet me reconsider: I have bottom pair, weak kicker, on a draw-heavy board. The opponent bet 1/4 pot, which is often a weak bet or a probe bet. I could raise to take control, but that would commit chips with a marginal hand. A call seems best to see the turn and re-evaluate.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the opponent's pattern:\n- In hand 52, they called preflop small (4) then made a big bet (40) on the flop\n- Now they bet small (8) into a 32 pot\n\nThis inconsistent sizing suggests they might not have a strong hand. But with my weak kicker, I should be cautious.\n\nI'll call the 8 chip bet to see the turn. It's a small investment relative to the pot, and I have position on the opponent.",

The board has paired 3s, so I have two pair (9s and 3s), but my 5 doesn't play in the two pair. I'm currently beating any hand that doesn't have:\n- A higher pair (Ts, Js, Qs, Ks, As)\n- A 3 for trips (3x)\n- A made hand like 67, 68, 79, 89 for straights\n- Any flush draw that hit\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 80 to win 128, so pot odds are 128:80 or 1.6:1. This means I need ~38% equity to call.\n\n**Opponent analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the opponent actions I see that GPT-OSS-120B:\n- Has been relatively passive postflop\n- Often checks and folds\n- Made a large bet on the flop in hand 52 (40 chips)\n- In hand 53, called preflop then folded\n- Generally seems to bet when they have something\n\n**The betting pattern this hand:**\n- Preflop: Seat 4 called, Seat 5 (SB) called, I checked\n- Flop: Seat 5 bet 8 (small bet), I called, Seat 4 called\n- Turn: Seat 5 bets 80 (very large bet relative to pot)\n\nThe turn bet is a massive overbet (80 into a 128 pot). This suggests:\n1. A very strong hand (trip 3s, full house, maybe a flush that hit)\n2. A complete bluff trying to push us out\n3. Could have a 6 and be protecting against the flush draw\n\nGiven that Seat 5 called preflop from SB, they could have:\n- Any suited connector, any pair, any Ax, any broadway\n- On the flop they bet small (8 into 24 pot) - could be a probe bet or weak lead\n- On the turn they bomb it - this is suspicious\n\n**My hand strength:** I have two pair (9s and 3s). This is a decent hand but vulnerable to:\n- Any 3 (trip 3s)\n- Any higher pair\n- Any straight draw that hit\n- Any flush that hit (hearts)\n\n**My position:** I'm in the BB and already invested. I called the flop bet of 8.\n\n**Decision:** The large overbet on the turn is concerning. With my two pair, I'm probably ahead of many hands but I'm not strong enough to call such a large bet. The pot odds are not great (need ~38% equity), and I think I'm good less than that against this action.\n\nI should fold here.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent actions for MiniMax-M2 (the only active opponent left):\n\nFrom the data:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been relatively tight preflop, folding 6 times out of 10 recorded preflop actions\n- When they do play, they often just call rather than raise (calling 4 times, raising only once)\n- They tend to be passive postflop with many checks and folds\n- They called a 48 chip bet on the flop once (hand #50), suggesting they can have some stronger hands\n\nMy situation:\n- Position: BTN (best position)\n- Cards: Qs 9d (offsuit, decent but not premium)\n- Stack: 441 chips (55.1 BB) - healthy\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- Need to call 4 to see flop\n- Can raise to 16 minimum\n\nWith Q9o on the button facing only the BB (MiniMax-M2), this is a reasonable hand to play. I'm getting 4:1 immediate pot odds to call (12:4 = 3:1, but there will be more chips to win postflop).\n\nThe opponent seems relatively tight/passive. From the button with Q9o, I have a few options:\n\n1. Fold - too tight, Q9o is playable from button\n2. Call - see flop in position with a decent hand\n3. Raise - try to take it down preflop or build pot with position\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm on the button (positional advantage)\n- Opponent is tight/passive\n- My hand has decent equity\n- I have a healthy stack\n\nI think a raise is appropriate here. A standard raise would be to about 3x the BB, so around 24 chips. However, the minimum raise is 16. I could either:\n- Raise to 24 (3x BB) as a standard steal attempt\n- Call and play postflop in position\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to fold preflop (6/10 times) and call rather than 3-bet, a raise seems like a good play. I'll raise to 24 to put pressure and potentially take down the pot preflop. If called, I'll have position and can evaluate the flop.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The minimum raise is 16, which is 2x the BB. A raise to 24 (3x BB) might be better. Let me make it 24 to make it a proper raise size.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the hand:\n\n**My hand:** 5s 6h (suited one-gapper)\n**Position:** BTN\n**Stack:** 453 chips (56.6 BB)\n**Blinds:** 4/8\n**Pot:** 12 chips\n**To call:** 4 chips (half a BB)\n**Minimum raise to:** 16 chips\n\n**Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 in BB with 209 chips\n\nLet me analyze what I know:\n\n1. **Hand strength:** 5\u26606\u2665 is a speculative hand - suited one-gapper. Decent for stealing and can make strong hands like straights and flushes.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the BTN, best position post-flop. Only MiniMax-M2 in BB to act after me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** Looking at the data for MiniMax-M2:\n   - They fold preflop quite often (hands 48, 49, 51, 54, 56, 58)\n   - When they do play, they tend to call rather than raise (hands 50, 52, 55, 57)\n   - They'll occasionally raise (hand 53)\n   - Post-flop, they can be passive (checking hands 47, 57)\n   - They fold to pressure (hand 50 turn, hand 52 flop, hand 55 turn)\n\n4. **My BTN history:** Looking at my recent BTN play:\n   - I often fold weak hands (30, 38, 45, 51, 57)\n   - I raise with strong hands (26, 34, 42, 54)\n   - I've called with speculative hands like 7h Th (hand 48) which won\n\n5. **Stack considerations:** \n   - I have 56.6 BB, healthy stack\n   - MiniMax has 26.1 BB, shorter but still playable\n   - This is a good spot to apply pressure\n\n**Decision:** With 5s 6h on BTN facing only the BB, this is a good stealing spot. The opponent folds preflop often. Even if called, I have position and a hand that can make strong draws.\n\nOptions:\n- **Fold:** Too tight, this is a profitable spot\n- **Call:** Could see a flop cheaply, but doesn't apply pressure\n- **Raise:** Good option, puts pressure on BB who folds a lot\n\nI should raise to steal the blinds. A standard raise would be 3x BB = 24 chips, but minimum is 16. Given the opponent folds a lot, even a min-raise might work. However, I should make it a standard size.\n\nLet me raise to 24 (3x BB). This is 20 more to call for the opponent, which is significant relative to their 209 chip stack.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Now I need to analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 5h 6h (suited connectors)\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - best position\n**Stack**: 465 chips (58.1 BB)\n**Blinds**: 4/8\n**Pot**: 12 chips\n**To call**: 8 chips\n\n**Opponents**:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): 205 chips, just posted SB\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): 304 chips, just posted BB\n\nLet me analyze the opponent tendencies:\n\n**MiniMax-M2 observations**:\n- Plays fairly straightforward, calls preflop raises with marginal hands (hand 40, 43, 46, 52, 55)\n- Makes continuation bets postflop (hands 40, 43, 46, 52)\n- Sometimes folds to aggression (hands 46, 50, 52, 55)\n- Has made raises (hand 53) and folds to aggression\n- Stack is 205 chips (25.6 BB) - getting short\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B observations**:\n- More aggressive preflop raiser (hands 41, 44, 54)\n- Makes large bets postflop (hand 52: 40 on flop, hand 55: 80 on turn)\n- Defends BB sometimes (hands 43, 46, 52, 55)\n- Can fold to aggression (hands 40, 41, 42, 44, 46, 54, 56, 59)\n- Stack is 304 chips (38 BB)\n\n**My analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 5h6h is a decent suited connector. It has good postflop playability and can make straights and flushes. On the button, this is a strong speculative hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button - the best position. I have position on both players postflop.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: Both opponents have relatively short stacks compared to mine. I have leverage.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - MiniMax-M2 plays straightforward and can fold to aggression\n   - GPT-OSS-120B is more aggressive but can also fold to aggression\n   - Both have shown they can fold to raises\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 58 BB, I have a healthy stack. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position. Stealing blinds is also valuable.\n\n**Decision**: \n- I have a good speculative hand in the best position\n- Both opponents are relatively short-stacked\n- I can either call and see a cheap flop with position, or raise to try to steal\n- Given that both opponents can fold to aggression, and I have position, a raise is good\n- A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 24 chips\n\nI should raise to 24 chips. This gives me good fold equity, and if called, I have position and a hand with good postflop potential.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Button with suited connectors (5h6h) is a strong speculative hand.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in the SB with 5s 8h - a very weak hand\n- My stack: 477 chips (29.8 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 72 chips\n- GPT-OSS-120B raised to 48 (3x BB)\n- I need to call 40 chips\n- Current pot odds: 72:40 or 1.8:1\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n5s 8h is a trash hand. It's not suited, not connected, and doesn't have any high cards. This is an easy fold in most situations.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has been raising preflop frequently with amounts ranging from 4 to 24 chips. The current raise of 48 is significantly larger than their typical raises, suggesting they might have a strong hand. They've been active and aggressive preflop.\n\n**Position and Stack:**\n- I'm in SB, which is the worst position\n- I have a healthy stack of 29.8 BB\n- Calling would commit 40 chips (about 8.4% of my stack) with a terrible hand\n- I could potentially raise to 80, but that would be 16.8% of my stack with 58\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- My stack is healthy at 29.8 BB\n- No need to take unnecessary risks\n- Better spots will come\n- The opponent's large raise (3x BB) suggests strength\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nI need to call 40 to win 72, which is 1.8:1 odds. I would need about 35.7% equity to make this call profitable. 58 has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 58 offsuit is one of the worst hands in poker. I have good stack depth, no need to gamble. The opponent's raise sizing suggests strength, and I'm out of position.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My Hand:** Jc 6d - This is a weak, offsuit hand. J6o is well below any reasonable preflop calling/raising range.\n\n**Position:** BB - I'm out of position postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 461 chips (28.8 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- MiniMax-M2 raised from 16 to 32 (2x the BB)\n- GPT-OSS-120B called from SB\n- I need to call 16 more to see a flop\n\n**Opponent tendencies from the recall:**\n- **MiniMax-M2:** Has been very tight, folding most hands preflop. Only called twice in the last 10 actions. This raise suggests a strong hand.\n- **GPT-OSS-120B:** Also quite tight, folding many hands. Called a raise in Hand 62 and then bet on the flop. In Hand 63, just checked through.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** J6o is a trash hand. It's not suited, not connected, and the Jack is weak kicker.\n2. **Pot odds:** I need to call 16 to win a pot of 80 (5:1 odds). While this seems decent, the implied odds are terrible with this hand.\n3. **Opponent strength:** MiniMax-M2's raise from early position (seat 4) with their tight image suggests a strong hand. GPT-OSS-120B's call also suggests some strength.\n4. **Position:** I'll be out of position against two opponents.\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With 28.8 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. This is an easy fold. J6o is not a defendable hand even getting decent odds, especially against a tight raiser and a caller. I should wait for a better spot.",

They can be aggressive but also passive. The raise to 32 here could be a standard open or could indicate strength.\n\n**My hand analysis:**\nJd 3s is a terrible hand. It's offsuit, disconnected, and has no real playability. Even from the SB where I'm getting a discount, this is a clear fold.\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions\n- I have a healthy stack of 28.3 BB, so no pressure to gamble\n- The pot is offering me 56:24 or about 2.33:1 odds, but even with those odds, J3o is not worth calling\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a decent stack and should preserve it\n- No need to get involved with marginal hands from bad position\n- The opponent's raise shows some strength, and I'll be out of position post-flop\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a clear fold. J3o is just too weak to call a raise from the SB, especially when I'll be out of position post-flop and have no real way to win the hand other than hitting a miracle flop.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 7d Jh (offsuit, low-medium strength)\n- Position: BTN (Button) - best position\n- Stack: 453 chips (28.3 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (SB, Seat 4):**\n- Hand 62: Folded on flop\n- Hand 63: Called preflop (8), then checked through flop, turn, river\n- Hand 64: Raised preflop to 32, then checked through flop, turn, river\n- Hand 65: Folded preflop\n- Pattern: Mixed strategy - sometimes raises, sometimes calls, sometimes folds. When they raise preflop, they tend to be passive postflop (checking through).\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B (BB, Seat 5):**\n- Hand 62: Bet 80 on flop\n- Hand 63: Checked through all streets after checking preflop\n- Hand 64: Called 24 preflop, then checked through all streets\n- Hand 65: Raised preflop to 32\n- Pattern: Also mixed, but seems more aggressive postflop when they bet (hand 62). Has shown both calling and raising preflop.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 7d Jh is marginal. It's offsuit, not connected, and only one high card (J). This is a fold in most situations.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is great, but that doesn't make this hand strong enough.\n3. **Pot odds**: Need to call 16 to win 24, so 1.5:1 odds. Not great for a marginal hand.\n4. **Stack preservation**: With 28.3 BB, I have a healthy stack but shouldn't waste chips on marginal hands.\n\n\n5. **Opponent ranges**: Both opponents have shown aggressive preflop actions. A raise would likely trigger a strong response, potentially putting my stack at risk. The potential for facing a 3-bet makes playing this hand even more dangerous, especially with my marginal holding.\n\nI'll fold this hand. The combination of weak cards, unfavorable pot odds, and risk of aggressive opponent action makes it an easy decision. Preserving my 28.3 BB stack is more valuable than speculating with a low-probability hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n**My hand**: 5c 4d (off-suit)\n**Board**: 2h 3d 9s\n**Position**: BB\n**Stack**: 437 chips (27.3 BB)\n**Pot**: 128 chips\n**Facing**: Bet of 80 from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)\n\n**Hand analysis**: I have 5c 4d on a 2h 3d 9s flop. This gives me:\n- An open-ended straight draw (need a 6 or an Ace to complete the straight)\n- 8 outs (4 sixes, 4 aces)\n- Runner-runner flush draw (very unlikely, not worth considering)\n- Backdoor straight possibilities but not relevant\n\n**Pot odds**: Pot is 128 + 80 = 208 chips, and I need to call 80. So 208:80 or about 2.6:1. I need roughly 28% equity to call (80/(208+80)).\n\n**My equity**: With 8 outs, I have about 16% chance to hit on the turn (8/47), and about 32% to hit by the river. With one card to come, I'm getting 2.6:1 pot odds but only have ~4:1 odds against hitting. So this is not a profitable call based purely on pot odds.\n\n**Opponent analysis**: From the recall:\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Recently has been passive (lots of checking, folding), but just made a bet of 80 into 128 pot - that's a strong bet\n- MiniMax-M2: Only has 125 chips left, hasn't been very aggressive\n\n**Tournament considerations**: I'm in decent shape with 27.3 BB. Calling 80 would cost me ~18% of my stack. This is a borderline situation.\n\n**The bet size**: 80 into 128 is a strong bet - about 62.5% pot. This suggests strength from GPT-OSS-120B.\n\n**My decision**: While I have a decent draw, the pot odds aren't quite there, and this would commit a significant portion of my stack. I should fold.",

It's not connected enough for straight draws, no flush potential, and low card strength.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Hand 67: Called preflop 16, called flop 80, checked turn/river\n- Hand 66: Called preflop 8, checked flop, bet turn 16\n- Hand 65: Folded preflop\n- Hand 64: Checked turn and river\n\nThis opponent seems to defend their blind sometimes but isn't overly aggressive. They can fold preflop (Hand 65) and seem to play somewhat passively postflop.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm on the Button, which is great position, but with such a weak hand, position advantage is limited.\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\n- I have 26.8 BB, which is a decent stack\n- MiniMax-M2 has 237 chips (14.8 BB), shorter stack\n- I should avoid bloating pots with marginal hands against shorter stacks\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nNeed to call 8 to win 24, getting 3:1 odds. But with 68o, even these odds don't justify calling.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- 26.8 BB is not a desperate stack\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Better to preserve chips for better opportunities\n\n**Decision:**\nFold. This is a trivial fold. 68o is one of the worst hands in poker, and while I'm getting decent pot odds and have position, it's just not worth investing chips with such a weak holding.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- My Position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- My Cards: Qs 9s (Queen of spades, 9 of spades) - suited connector, decent but not premium\n- My Stack: 429 chips (26.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 253 chips (15.8 BB) - in SB\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 280 chips (17.5 BB) - in BB\n\n**Opponent Tendencies from Recall:**\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (SB):**\n- Hand 64: Checked turn and river (passive)\n- Hand 65: Preflop fold\n- Hand 66: Called 8 preflop, checked flop, bet 16 on turn (somewhat aggressive when they enter)\n- Hand 67: Called 16 preflop, called 80 on flop, checked turn and river (calling station tendencies)\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B (BB):**\n- Hand 65: Raised to 32 preflop (aggressive)\n- Hand 66: Checked preflop and flop, folded turn\n- Hand 67: Called 8 preflop, bet 80 on flop, checked turn and river\n- Hand 68: Preflop fold\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Q9s is a decent suited hand from the button. It has good playability postflop and can make strong hands like straights, flushes, or top pair.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last on all postflop streets.\n\n3. **Stack Sizes**: I have a healthy 26.8 BB stack. The opponents have mid-stacks (15.8 BB and 17.5 BB), which means they're not desperate yet but can't be too reckless.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: \n   - MiniMax seems to call a lot and be somewhat passive\n   - GPT-OSS shows some aggression (raised preflop in hand 65, bet flop in hand 67)\n   - Both players have shown they can fold\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: With 26.8 BB, I can afford to see flops with speculative hands, especially in position. Q9s is definitely playable from the button.\n\n**Decision**: I should raise here. Being on the button with a suited hand, I want to:\n- Build the pot when I have position\n- Potentially take down the blinds preflop\n- Set myself up to win postflop with position advantage\n\nA standard raise would be to 3x the big blind = 48 chips. Since the minimum raise is 32, 48 is a good size - it's enough to put pressure but not commit too many chips.\n\nLet me raise to 48 chips.",

When they just call from SB (like now), they could have:\n- Weak hands just trying to see a flop cheaply\n- Medium strength hands\n- Sometimes traps\n\n**Position and Stack Considerations:**\n- I'm on the button with position advantage\n- I have a healthy stack (27.3 BB)\n- Opponent has 264 chips (16.5 BB) - shorter stack\n- Pot is small (32 chips)\n\n\n- Checking is completely free\n- Raising would risk chips with a very weak hand\n- Folding would give up the BB I already put in, but it's only 16 chips\n\nI'll take a free flop in position with my weak hand. The pot's small enough that checking costs nothing, and I might catch something on the board. With 27.3 BB, I can afford to see a cheap flop and potentially outplay my opponent post-flop. The risk of raising with Th 3d far outweighs any potential reward, especially against an opponent with a shorter stack who might be tempted to defend aggressively.\n\nChecking keeps me in the hand with zero additional investment, preserving my stack while maintaining positional advantage. It's the most strategically sound move given my current hand strength and table dynamics.",

I have a pair of 3s, but there's a flush draw on the board with three clubs. My 3d is not a club, so I don't have any flush draw. My pair of 3s is very weak on this board - the King is a high card and the flush draw makes my hand even more vulnerable.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (button), which is good position post-flop. I get to act last.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Only one opponent remains (Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B) with 264 chips. They posted the small blind and called preflop, then checked on the flop.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 32 chips, and it's free to check. Checking costs me nothing.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 437 chips (27.3 BB) which is a decent stack. I shouldn't risk chips with such a weak hand.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- I have bottom pair on a board with a King and a flush draw\n- My opponent checked, showing weakness\n- However, my hand is extremely vulnerable. Any club gives someone a flush, any King gives them top pair, and there are many overcards that could beat me\n- Even if my opponent is weak, I have very little to gain by betting here\n- Checking gives me a free card to see if I improve to trips (though unlikely)\n- Betting would be a bluff, but I have no fold equity with such a weak hand and my opponent already invested chips preflop\n\n**Decision**: Check. There's nothing to gain by betting here. My hand is too weak to value bet, and I don't have enough fold equity to bluff. Checking is free and allows me to see the turn card without risking chips.",

I have a pair of 3s with a Ten kicker. The board shows:\n   - Kc 3c 7c: Three clubs on the board (potential flush)\n   - 4h: Fourth card\n   - I have no clubs in my hand, so I don't have a flush draw\n   - I have a pair of 3s, which is very weak on this board\n\n2. **Board texture**: Very dangerous board with three clubs. Anyone with a club has a flush draw, and someone could already have a made flush. The King is also a high card that could easily be in my opponent's range.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively passive:\n   - Frequently checks (hands 63, 64, 66, 67)\n   - Sometimes makes big bets (bet 80 on flop in hands 62 and 67)\n   - Has folded preflop recently (hands 68, 69)\n   - Made a turn fold in hand 66\n   - Overall seems to be a somewhat passive player who occasionally makes big bets\n\n4. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position, but with a weak hand that doesn't matter much.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is 32 chips and I can check for free. If I bet, I risk chips with a very weak hand.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I have 27.3 BB, which is a healthy stack. I shouldn't be risking chips with such a weak hand on a dangerous board.\n \nThe situation is clear: I have a marginal hand with no real chance of improvement. Checking is the most prudent move, preserving my chip stack and avoiding unnecessary risk on a potentially dangerous board. The opponent's passive tendencies further support a conservative approach, making a check the safest strategic decision.",

I have two pair but the board has 4 clubs (flush possible)\n2. Opponent checked to me showing weakness\n3. I have position and can control the pot\n4. The opponent has shown they can bet when strong (hand 67 flop bet)\n5. Since they checked, they likely don't have a strong hand or the flush\n\nI should make a value bet here. Two pair is likely good since opponent checked, and I can get value from weaker hands like a single pair or maybe a smaller two pair. The bet size should be small to medium since the flush is scary but I want to extract value.\n\nA bet of around 16-24 chips seems appropriate (half to 3/4 pot). Let me bet 20 chips.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I need to analyze this hand situation:\n\n**My hand:** 6s Qh (offsuit, not connected, low card)\n**Position:** SB (small blind)\n**Stack:** 461 chips (28.8 BB)\n**Blinds:** 8/16\n**Pot:** 40 chips\n**Action so far:** \n- I posted SB 8\n- MiniMax-M2 posted BB 16\n- GPT-OSS-120B called 16\n\nI need to call 8 more chips (to complete the blind), or I can raise to at least 32 (which would be a min-raise).\n\nLet me think about this:\n\n1. **Hand strength:** Q6 offsuit is a very weak hand. Q-high is marginal, and the 6 doesn't help much. This is a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions post-flop. I'll be out of position against both opponents.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** From the recall data, MiniMax-M2:\n   - Folds preflop frequently (hands 65, 69, 70)\n   - Calls sometimes (hands 66, 67)\n   - When they see flops, they can be aggressive (bet 16 on turn in hand 66, called 80 on flop in hand 67)\n   - Overall seems somewhat tight but capable of calling and playing post-flop\n\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 8 chips to win 40 chips, which is 5:1 pot odds. This is attractive, but with Q6o, even these odds don't justify calling given how weak my hand is.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With 28.8 BB, I'm in decent shape. I don't need to gamble with a weak hand from a bad position. Preserving my stack is important.\n\n6. **The call from GPT-OSS-120B:** This suggests they might have something, or they could just be calling with a wide range. But even if they're weak, I'm still out of position against two players with a terrible hand.\n \nThe numbers confirm this is a clear fold. The pot odds and hand strength simply don't justify staying in the hand. I'll lose more chips than I'll gain by calling with such a weak position and poor cards.",

J8o is not strong enough to defend from SB against a raise, especially when I'll be out of position postflop. The opponent's raise to 3x suggests they have a real hand.

This is a decent hand, especially on the button.\n**Position**: BTN (button) - Best position post-flop\n**Stack**: 461 chips (28.8 BB) - Healthy stack\n**Blinds**: 8/16\n**Pot**: 24 chips\n**To call**: 16 chips\n\nOpponents:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 477 chips, in SB - Has been relatively passive, folding preflop often, calling when they enter\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 24 chips, in BB - Very short stack, just 1.5 BB. They raised in hand 74 and were aggressive post-flop\n\nKey observations:\n1. GPT-OSS-120B is extremely short stacked (24 chips = 1.5 BB). They're in the BB and have shown aggression previously (raised to 48 in hand 74, then bet 80 on flop and turn).\n2. MiniMax-M2 in SB has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 72, 73) but called in hand 74.\n3. I'm on the button with a decent hand.\n\nGiven GPT-OSS-120B's short stack, they're likely to shove or make a big move. They only have 24 chips left after posting the BB, so they can't make a normal raise - it would be an all-in.\n\nWith KTo on the button, I should:\n- Consider raising to isolate the short stack\n- The short stack might shove with a wide range\n- MiniMax has been passive and might fold to aggression\n\nSince GPT-OSS-120B only has 24 chips total and they've already put in 16, they have 8 chips left. If I raise, they would likely go all-in for their remaining 8 chips.\n\nLet me think about the math:\n- Pot is currently 24 (8 from SB + 16 from BB)\n- If I call 16, pot becomes 40\n- If I raise to 32 (minimum), and GPT-OSS-120B shoves for 8 more, pot would be 24+32+8 = 64, and I'd have to call 8 more (if MiniMax folds)\n\nActually, let me recalculate: GPT-OSS-120B has 24 chips total. They've posted 16 as BB, so they have 8 chips left. If I raise to 32, they can only call 8 more chips (all-in).\n\nI think raising is the right play here to:\n1. Isolate the short stack\n2. Put pressure on MiniMax who has been passive\n3. Build a pot with a decent hand in position\n\nGiven the stack sizes, a raise to about 40-48 seems appropriate. Let me raise to 48, which matches GPT-OSS-120B's previous raise size in hand 74.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. GPT-OSS-120B has only 8 chips left after posting BB. If I raise to 48:\n- They can only call 8 (all-in)\n- MiniMax would have to call 40 more\n- Pot would be 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 48 (my raise) + 8 (GPT all-in) = 80\n\nActually, I need to be more precise about the stack calculation. GPT-OSS-120B has 24 chips total. They posted 16 as BB, leaving them with 8 chips. So they can only put in 8 more chips maximum.\n\nIf I raise to 48:\n- MiniMax in SB has already put in 8, needs to call 40 more\n- GPT-OSS-120B in BB has put in 16, can only call 8 more (all-in)\n- I would be putting in 48 total\n\nThe pot would be: 8 (SB) + 16 (BB) + 48 (my raise) = 72, and then GPT-OSS-120B could add 8 more if they choose to call (all-in), making it 80 total.\n\nBut wait, if GPT-OSS-120B has 24 chips and posted 16, they have 8 left. They can call any raise by going all-in for their remaining 8.\n\nLet me think about whether I should just call or raise:\n- If I call 16: Pot is 40, we see flop 3-way, GPT-OSS-120B has 8 left\n- If I raise: I can isolate and build pot\n\nWith KTo on the button, this is definitely a raising hand given the situation. The short stack in BB is likely to go all-in with a wide range, and I'm ahead of their range. The SB has been passive.\n\nI'll raise to 48, which is 3x"

It's offsuit, not connected, and my King is decent but the 7 kicker is weak. In the BB facing a limp from the SB, I have:\n- Position: I'm out of position postflop (BB)\n- Hand strength: Weak - at best I might have a King-high hand\n- Pot odds: I'm getting a free check (no more to call)\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check. Here's why:\n1. My hand is too weak to raise with, especially out of position\n2. MiniMax-M2 is tight but passive - if I raise, they might fold their weaker hands but call with better ones\n3. I have no information about what they limped with - could be anything from weak suited connectors to small pairs to trap hands\n4. I preserve my stack and see a flop for free with a marginal hand\n5. The pot is small (32 chips) and not worth fighting for with K7o OOP\n\nChecking is the standard, optimal play here.",

Even if my King is good now, any Ace, Jack, or pair beats me. The opponent called preflop from SB, so they could have:\n- Any Ace (dominating me)\n- Any Jack\n- Any pocket pair\n- Some spade draws\n- Random hands\n\nGiven that the opponent is passive and I have no hand, no draw, and I'm out of position, I should check and see what they do. If they bet, I'll likely fold. There's no reason to bluff here against a passive player who has shown they can call bets.\n\nI should check and see a free card, hoping to hit a King.",

They called 8 more (so 16 total) and I checked. Pot is 48.\n- Flop: I checked, they bet 16 (1/3 pot)\n\nThis is a small bet. They could be:\n1. C-betting with air\n2. Betting a weak pair\n3. Betting a strong hand like Ax, Jx, or a set\n\n**Pot odds**: 16 to win 48 = 3:1 = 25% equity needed\n\n**My equity**: With K-high, I likely have around 15-20% equity against a typical betting range here. I need to hit a King or runner-runner straight.\n\n**Position**: I'm out of position, which is bad. If I call, I'll have to act first on future streets.\n\n**Stack sizes**: I have 30 BB, which is healthy. Calling 16 chips won't hurt my stack much.\n\n**Decision**: This is a marginal spot. I have some showdown value with my King high, and the opponent's bet is small. However:\n- I'm out of position\n- I only have K-high\n- The board hits many hands\n\n\nI'll fold this hand. The small pot odds don't justify continuing with just King-high against a likely stronger range. The out-of-position disadvantage and limited drawing potential make this an easy fold, preserving my 30 BB stack for better opportunities.",

It's definitely playable from the button.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position in poker. I get to act last postflop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 477 chips (29.8 BB) - This is a healthy stack, not short-stacked.\n\n4. **Current situation**: \n   - Pot is 24 chips (8 from small blind + 16 from big blind)\n   - I need to call 8 to see the flop\n   - Minimum raise is to 32\n\n5. **Opponent info**: MiniMax-M2 is the only active player in the big blind. From the hand history:\n   - They folded preflop in hands 73 and 75\n   - They called preflop in hands 74 and 76\n   - In hand 74, they called down multiple streets (flop, turn, river) with checks\n   - In hand 76, they bet on the flop after calling preflop\n\n   This suggests MiniMax-M2 is somewhat passive but capable of betting when they have something. They seem to defend their blind sometimes but not aggressively.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 29.8 BB, I have room to play, but I should be careful not to get into trouble with marginal hands.\n\nWith Ace-Jack suited on the button, this is a clear raising hand. I want to:\n- Build the pot with a strong hand\n- Take control of the hand\n- Isolate against the big blind\n- Potentially win the pot preflop\n\nA standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 48 chips, or about 2.5x-3x the BB is typical. Since the minimum is 32, I could raise to something like 48-56 chips.\n\nLet me raise to 48 (3x BB) which is a standard sizing.",

It's:\n- Not suited\n- Low cards\n- 2-gap (5-6-7) - barely connected\n- Typically a fold in most situations\n\n**Position advantage:**\nI'm on the Button, which is great position postflop, but I only have one opponent (BB) since SB folded. With 75bb effective stacks, position matters but hand strength is still paramount preflop.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nMiniMax-M2 in BB (Seat 4):\nFrom the recall data:\n- Very tight player - folds a lot preflop (hands 69, 70, 72, 73, 75, 77, 78)\n- When they do play, they tend to be passive (lots of checking)\n- In hand 74: called preflop, then called flop and turn bets\n- In hand 76: called preflop, then made a small flop bet\n- Overall: tight-passive player\n\n**Pot odds:**\nI need to call 8 to win 24, getting 3:1 odds. This is attractive, but with a hand this weak, even good pot odds don't justify calling.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy 31.3 BB stack\n- No need to get involved with marginal hands\n- Better spots will come\n- Even against a tight BB, 75o is just too weak to play profitably\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: The standard play. Hand is too weak.\n2. **Call**: Could complete with good pot odds, but hand is very weak and I'll be out of position postflop (wait, I'm actually IN position on the button). Still not recommended.\n3. **Raise**: Could steal from the tight BB. Min-raise to 32 would be a steal attempt. With 31.3 BB, I can afford this.\n\n**Steal consideration:**\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 is tight and folds a lot preflop, a raise could be profitable as a steal. However:\n\n\nA cautious approach is more sensible. The risks of raising with such a weak hand outweigh the potential benefits. Despite the opponent's tight play, the hand's fundamental weakness makes it a clear fold. I'll preserve my chips for a better opportunity, maintaining a disciplined strategy that protects my stack and waits for more favorable situations.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me think about this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the Button with Jh 4h\n- I have 493 chips (15.4 BB)\n- Blinds are 16/32\n- MiniMax-M2 is in the Big Blind with 437 chips\n- Everyone else has folded\n- I need to call 16 to see the flop (half the big blind since I posted small blind)\n\n**My cards:** Jh 4h - This is a suited connector but very weak. J4 suited is not a great hand, even on the button.\n\n**Opponent analysis:** Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Hand 80: Preflop fold\n- Hand 78: Preflop fold  \n- Hand 77: Preflop fold\n- Hand 76: Called 8, then bet 16 on flop\n- Hand 75: Preflop fold\n- Hand 74: Called 80 on flop, checked turn, called 80 on turn, checked river\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems to be playing relatively tight, folding preflop frequently. When they do play, they seem to call rather than raise aggressively.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button, which is the best position post-flop. This gives me an advantage.\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 15.4 BB, which is getting short but not desperate yet. MiniMax has 13.7 BB.\n\n**Pot odds:** The pot is 48 chips and I need to call 16, so I'm getting 3:1 odds. However, with J4s, I'm rarely going to have a strong hand even if I hit.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. My hand is very weak (J4s)\n2. I'm on the button (good position)\n3. Opponent seems tight\n4. I have a medium-short stack (15.4 BB)\n5. Getting 3:1 pot odds\n\n**Analysis:** \nWith J4s, I could hit a flush draw, straight draw, or make a pair of Jacks. However:\n- If I hit a Jack, I'll have second pair with a weak kicker\n- The flush potential is there but it's a low flush (4-high)\n- I could make a straight with 3-5-6-7 or 5-6-7-8, but that's unlikely\n\nGiven my medium-short stack and the weak hand, I should be looking for better spots. Even though I have position and decent pot odds, J4s is just too weak to play here. \n\nThe risk/reward isn't great - if I call and miss the flop (which will happen most of the time), I'll have invested 16 chips into a pot where I'll likely have to fold to any aggression. If I hit something marginal, I could lose more chips.\n\nI should fold and preserve my stack for a better opportunity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this preflop situation:\n\n**My Hand:** Qs 9c - This is a moderately weak hand. Q9 offsuit is not a premium hand and should typically be folded in most positions, especially early positions. However, I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position postflop.\n\n**Stack Size:** I have 493 chips which is 15.4 BB. This is a short stack situation where I need to be careful but also look for spots to accumulate chips.\n\n**Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 in the BB with 437 chips (13.7 BB). Looking at their recent history:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 72, 73, 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84)\n- When they do play (hand 74), they called preflop and then called bets on flop and turn, showing a tendency to call down with marginal hands\n- They seem relatively passive, checking frequently and folding often\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 16 to win a pot of 48, which is 3:1 odds. That's attractive odds, but with Q9o I need to consider:\n\n1. **Hand Strength:** Q9o is a marginal hand. It's dominated by many hands that the BB could have (AQ, KQ, QJ, QT). \n2. **Position:** I'm on the Button, which is excellent position. If I call, I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Stack Sizes:** Both stacks are short. If I call and hit something, I could potentially get the BB's entire stack.\n4. **Opponent Tendency:** MiniMax-M2 folds a lot preflop but seems to call down when they do play. This means if I hit top pair, I might get value.\n\n**Decision:** With 15.4 BB, I should generally be playing a tight range. Q9o is below the threshold for a standard open-raise, and as a call from the SB, it's marginal. However, given:\n- I'm getting 3:1 pot odds\n- I have position\n- The opponent is passive and folds often\n- My stack is short enough that I could potentially get their whole stack if I hit\n\nI think this is a borderline call. However, Q9o is really not a strong hand. The fact that it's offsuit reduces its playability significantly. I think the correct play here is to fold and preserve my stack for a better spot, especially since I need to be careful with only 15.4 BB in a tournament.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 15.4 BB, I'm in the \"push/fold\" territory for many hands, but Q9o is not strong enough to shove with. The call is only 16 chips (0.5 BB), so it's a small investment. Given my position and the opponent's passivity, I could call and see a flop. If I hit top pair or better, I could potentially win a big pot. If I miss, I can easily fold.\n\nThe pot odds are good (3:1), position is excellent, and the investment is small relative to my stack. I think calling is defensible here. However, Q9o offsuit is quite weak...\n\nLet me think about tournament equity. With 15.4 BB, I should be looking for spots to either shove or fold. Calling with marginal hands can lead to difficult postflop decisions that could cost me more chips. The safer play is to fold and wait for a better hand or a better spot (like shoving with a stronger hand).\n\nI think folding is the more disciplined play here. Q9o is just too weak, and while the pot odds are good, I don't want to get involved with a marginal hand when I'm short-stacked.",

I should raise for value and to isolate. Since there's only one opponent and I have position, I want to:\n\n1. Build the pot with my strong hand\n2. Isolate against one opponent\n3. Take control of the hand\n4. Extract value from weaker hands\n\nGiven the pot is 64 and minimum raise is 64, I should make a substantial raise. A standard raise would be 3x the big blind (96), but since there's already 32 in the pot from the limp, I could raise to around 96-128 total.\n\nLet me raise to 96 total (3x BB), which is a standard sizing that puts pressure on the opponent while building the pot with my premium hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- I'm on the BTN with 4d 2d (unsuited, very weak hand)\n- Stack: 509 chips (15.9 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- To call: 16 chips (I'm the SB)\n\n**Opponent:**\n- MiniMax-M2 in BB with 421 chips\n- This is heads up (BTN vs BB)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n4d 2d is a very weak hand. Even though they're suited, the ranks are extremely low. This hand has very little equity against any reasonable range.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm on the BTN which is good position, but with a very weak hand.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nLooking at the search results for MiniMax-M2:\n- Hand 73: Folded BB\n- Hand 74: Called from SB, then check-called flop and turn, folded on river (showed passivity)\n- Hand 75: Folded to BTN raise\n- Hand 76: Called from BB, bet flop when checked to\n- Hand 77: Folded to BTN raise\n- Hand 78: Folded BB\n- Hand 80: Folded BB\n- Hand 82: Folded BB\n- Hand 84: Folded BB\n- Hand 86: Called from BB, then folded to raise\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 frequently folds from BB (hands 73, 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84) but sometimes calls and then folds to aggression (hand 86). They seem to defend BB somewhat but are generally passive and fold to pressure.\n\n**Stack Size Considerations:**\nI have 15.9 BB - this is a short stack but not desperate yet. I need to be selective with my hands. With 4-2 offsuit, this is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nI need to call 16 to win 48 (3:1 pot odds). While this might seem tempting, 4-2 offsuit has very poor equity against any hand. Even against a random hand, 4-2 offsuit only has about 35% equity.\n\n**ICM/Tournament Considerations:**\nWith 15.9 BB, I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips, but this is not a good spot. I should wait for a better hand or a better situation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a clear fold. 4-2 offsuit is one of the worst hands in poker, and even though I'm getting 3:1 pot odds and have position, it's not worth investing chips with such a weak holding when I have a short stack. I should preserve my chips for a better spot.",

Even if I hit a 7 or 9, I'll likely be dominated. The only real hope is a straight draw, but that's unlikely.\n\nWith a tight opponent who limped, they likely have something like small pocket pair, Ax, or two face cards. My 7-9 offsuit is likely crushed.\n\nThe smart tournament play is to fold this garbage hand and preserve chips. Even though it's free to see the flop, playing out of position with a weak hand against a tight player is -EV.\n\nHowever, wait - I should reconsider. It's actually FREE to see the flop (amount to call is 0). Checking costs me nothing. Even with a weak hand, seeing a free flop in the BB is standard. If I completely miss, I can easily fold to any bet. If I somehow get lucky and flop two pair or a straight, I might extract value from the opponent.\n\nThe correct play is to check and see the free flop. Folding when you can check for free is too tight.",

This is a terrible hand on this board. The board has three clubs including an Ace, which is very dangerous.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall, MiniMax-M2 has:\n- Folded preflop many times (hands 72, 73, 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84)\n- Called preflop occasionally (hands 74, 76, 86)\n- In hand 74: Called flop and turn bets, suggesting they can call with marginal hands\n- In hand 76: Made a small flop bet\n- Generally seems somewhat passive but willing to call\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Preflop: SB posted 16, I posted BB 32, SB called 16 more (making it 32 total), I checked\n- So preflop action suggests SB might have a marginal hand that wanted to see a cheap flop\n- Now on the flop, it's checked to me and I can check or bet\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a terrible board for my hand. I have:\n- No pair\n- No draw (not even a gutshot)\n- The board is very coordinated with a flush draw\n\nI should check here. Betting would be pure bluff, and given the coordinated board and that my opponent called preflop, they likely have something. Even if they missed, they might call with any Ax, any club, any pair, or any straight draw.\n\nChecking is the clear best option. I have no equity and no reason to bet.",

With 14.9 BB stack, I want to preserve chips rather than risk them on a marginal draw when the opponent could easily have a better hand or be drawing to a flush.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- My hand: 7c 9d\n- Board: 5c Ac 4c 6d\n- Position: BB vs SB\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- My stack: 477 chips (14.9 BB)\n- Amount to call: 0 (can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have 7c 9d\n- Board shows 5c Ac 4c 6d\n- This gives me a straight! 4-5-6-7 (I need an 8 to complete 4-5-6-7-8)\n- I also have a club, and there are 3 clubs on board (Ac 5c 4c), so a flush is possible\n- Currently I have a straight draw with one card to come\n\n**Opponent analysis (MiniMax-M2 in SB):**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Preflop: Very tight, mostly folding (hands 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84 were folds)\n- When they do enter pots (hands 76, 86), they just call\n- On flop: Usually checks (hands 62, 63, 64, 66, 71, 74)\n- They occasionally bet small (hand 76: bet 16 on flop)\n- They fold to pressure sometimes (hand 62: check-folded on flop)\n- They call big bets sometimes (hand 67: called 80 on flop, hand 74: called 80 on flop)\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Preflop: SB just called, I checked\n- Flop: I checked, SB checked\n- Turn: It's on me to act\n\nThe opponent checked the flop, which suggests they likely don't have a strong hand like top pair or better. They could have:\n- A weak ace\n- A draw\n- Complete air\n- A medium pocket pair\n\nMy hand: I have an open-ended straight draw (need 3 or 8, but 3 is less likely to be good). Actually wait, let me recount: 4-5-6-7 - I need an 8 to make the straight. So I have 4 outs to a straight (four 8s in the deck).\n \nI'm facing a potential flush threat with three clubs on the board. My 7c might actually be a disadvantage if the opponent is drawing for a flush. The pot is relatively small at 64 chips, and my stack is healthy at 14.9 big blinds. \n\nI need to carefully consider my options. Checking could allow me to see the river for free, but it also risks giving the opponent a chance to improve their hand. A small bet might provide some information about their hand strength while keeping the pot manageable.\n\nThe opponent's previous betting patterns suggest they're cautious, so a strategic check or a minimal bet could be the most prudent approach. I want to avoid overcommitting to a draw that might not be as strong as it initially appears.\n\nThe 8 of clubs is particularly problematic, as it would simultaneously complete potential flush draws. While my straight draw seems promising, the board's texture introduces significant complications. With multiple potential draws and a conservative opponent, checking seems the most prudent strategy. This allows me to preserve my stack and see the river without unnecessary risk.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight playing style and the board's potential dangers, a cautious approach minimizes potential losses while maintaining future strategic flexibility.\n\nChecking here aligns with several key poker principles: pot control, risk management, and allowing the opponent to potentially reveal hand strength on the river.",

Not even a pair. The board shows:\n  - 3 clubs (Ac, 5c, 4c) - flush possible\n  - Straight possibilities: 3-4-5-6-7 would give me a straight with my 7, but there's no 3\n  - I have 7 high, which is terrible\n\n**Opponent Analysis (MiniMax-M2 from recall):**\nLooking at the opponent actions:\n- Generally tight - folds preflop often (hands 72, 73, 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84)\n- When they do play, they tend to be passive (lots of checks)\n- In hand 74, they called down with check/call lines on flop, turn, and river\n- In hand 76, they bet 16 on flop after calling preflop\n- Overall pattern: tight-passive player who checks often\n\n**Current Hand Action:**\n- Preflop: SB calls 16, I check (they have a hand but not strong enough to raise)\n- Flop: I check, they check (they don't have a strong hand or are trapping)\n- Turn: I check, they check (still no aggression)\n- River: Action is on me\n\n**Decision:**\nI have absolutely nothing (7 high). The opponent has shown no aggression at all and has been checking back. They could have:\n- A weak pair\n- Ace with weak kicker\n- Some draw that missed\n- Complete air\n\nSince I have nothing and they've shown no aggression, checking is the clear play. There's no value in betting - they would only call with better hands. I might have the best hand (if they have complete air), but I can't get value from worse hands or make better hands fold.\n\nI should check and hope my 7 high is good, or that we both have nothing and I win with the best high card.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 14.9 BB, which is getting short but not desperate\n- No need to risk chips with complete air\n- Preserve stack for better spots\n\nThe decision is clear: CHECK",

However, we need to be careful - a min-raise to 64 commits about 14% of our stack. \n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 14.4 BB, we should be thinking about either:\n- Folding marginal hands\n- Raising to steal\n- Shoving strong hands\n\nJTo from the button is good enough to raise as a steal attempt against a tight BB. A standard raise to 64 (2x BB) should be sufficient. If we get called, we have position and can evaluate the flop.\n\nAlternatively, we could just call and see a flop cheaply, preserving our stack for a better spot.\n\nLet me think about the EV:\n- If we raise to 64 and BB folds (likely given tightness), we win 48 chips\n- If we raise to 64 and BB calls, we have position\n\nI think raising is slightly better than calling here. It gives us fold equity and we don't commit too much of our stack.",

AJ offsuit is definitely a raising hand from the button.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position in poker. I get to act last on every street.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 509 chips (15.9 BB). This is a medium stack - not desperate but not deep either.\n\n4. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 is in the big blind with 421 chips (about 13.2 BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They fold preflop frequently (hands 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84, 89, 90)\n   - They sometimes call (hands 76, 86, 88) \n   - When they do see flops, they tend to play passively (check-calling in hand 74, checking in hand 88)\n   - They seem to be a relatively tight/passive player\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: The pot is 48 chips, I need to call 16 to see the flop. That's 3:1 pot odds, which is great for a hand like AJ.\n\n6. **Action**: It's just me (SB) and MiniMax-M2 (BB). The action is on me to complete the small blind.\n\n**Decision**: With AJ on the button against a tight/passive opponent, this is a clear raise. I want to:\n- Build the pot with my strong hand\n- Take control of the hand\n- Put pressure on the BB\n- Potentially win the pot preflop\n\nGiven my stack size (15.9 BB), I should raise to about 2.5-3x the BB. The minimum raise is 64 (2x BB), but that's a bit small. A standard raise would be 80-96 chips (2.5x-3x BB).\n\nLet me raise to 80 chips (2.5x BB). This is a solid sizing that:\n- Puts pressure on the BB\n- Doesn't commit too much of my stack\n- Gives me room to fold if the BB shoves and I don't feel good about it\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the opponent's pattern, they fold to preflop pressure quite often.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: 9d 5h - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and with a large gap. It's not a profitable hand to play in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. However, this is preflop action.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 557 chips (17.4 BB), which is getting short-stacked in tournament terms. I need to be careful with my chips.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - I posted the small blind (16 chips)\n   - MiniMax-M2 posted the big blind (32 chips)\n   - I need to call 16 more chips to see the flop\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n   - They have been folding a lot preflop (hands 89, 90, 91, 92)\n   - When they do play, they tend to be passive (calling then checking down)\n   - Their showdown history shows they've played some weak hands (53, 5c3s, JdQd)\n   - They seem to be a somewhat loose-passive player\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 48 chips and I need to call 16 chips, giving me 3:1 pot odds. This means I need ~25% equity to break even.\n\n7. **Hand equity**: 9-5 offsuit has very poor equity against any reasonable calling range. Even against a random hand, it only has about 40% equity, and against a typical BB defending range, it's much worse (likely 30% or less).\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: With 17.4 BB, I'm in the danger zone but not desperate yet. I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips, but this is not a good spot. 9-5 offsuit is a clear fold in most situations, especially when I'm not extremely short-stacked.\n\n9. **Position advantage**: While I have position post-flop, the hand is just too weak to justify calling. Even if I hit a 9 or 5, I'll often be dominated by better kickers.\n\nThe only argument for calling is that MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot, so I might be able to steal the pot post-flop. But with such a weak hand, this is a low-percentage play that risks valuable tournament chips.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. The hand is too weak, my stack is still healthy enough to wait for better spots, and the risk/reward isn't favorable.",

Here's why:\n1. My hand Q3o is extremely weak - one of the worst hands in poker\n2. MiniMax-M2 is tight and only called the SB completion, suggesting they might have something\n3. Raising would be spewing chips with a trash hand against a tight player\n4. I can see a free flop from the BB\n5. Even though I'm out of position postflop, the pot is small and checking costs nothing\n\n\n6. My stack is too valuable to waste on Q3o\n\nI'll conserve my chips and check, preserving my stack for a better opportunity.

However, there are two hearts on the board (Jh and 7h), so a flush draw is possible.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n1. My hand: Qs 3h - I have two pair (Jacks and Queens) but my kicker is weak (3h)\n2. Position: BB, acting first on the flop\n3. Stack: 525 chips (16.4 BB) - decent stack\n4. Opponent: MiniMax-M2 in SB with 389 chips\n5. Board: Js Jh 7h - paired board with flush draw\n6. Pot: 64 chips\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They tend to fold preflop a lot (folded in hands 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84, 89, 90, 91, 92)\n- When they do play, they can call (hands 74, 76, 86, 88)\n- In hand 76, they bet on the flop\n- In hand 74, they called on the turn and checked on the river\n- In hand 88, they checked through flop, turn, and river\n\nThe pattern suggests MiniMax-M2 is relatively tight/passive. They fold a lot preflop and when they do see flops, they don't always bet aggressively.\n\nOn this flop:\n- I have two pair but the board is paired (Jacks), which means anyone with a Jack has trips\n- There are two hearts, so a flush draw is possible\n- My kicker (3h) is very weak\n- I'm out of position\n\nGiven that the board is paired and there's a flush draw, and my kicker is weak, I should be cautious. However, I likely have the best hand right now against a tight player who just called preflop from SB.\n\nI should bet for value and protection against the flush draw. A bet of around 1/2 to 2/3 pot seems appropriate.\nPot is 64, so a bet of 32-42 chips would be good.\n \nI'll carefully consider my options. Checking could be a strategic move against an aggressive opponent, but MiniMax-M2's passive style suggests a value bet might work better. I'll make a calculated bet of 32 chips - a solid value bet that protects my hand and extracts value from weaker holdings. This sizing allows me to control the pot while maintaining pressure on my opponent.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - great position\n- Cards: Qc 5c (Queen of clubs, 5 of clubs) - suited but not connected, relatively weak hand\n- Stack: 573 chips (17.9 BB) - slightly below 20BB, getting short\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48\n- To call: 16 (completing from SB to BB)\n- Min raise: 64\n\n**Opponent Analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Very tight player - mostly folding preflop (16/20 actions were folds)\n- Only calls with strong hands (called 4 times, folded 3 of those on flop)\n- Never raises preflop (0 raises found)\n- When they do call, they often fold on the flop (e.g., hand 86 and 94)\n- Passive post-flop play (checking rather than betting)\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Q5s is marginal. It's suited but not connected, and Q-high is weak.\n2. **Position**: Button is great, but we're facing a single opponent in the BB.\n3. **Stack Size**: 17.9BB is getting short. We need to be selective and look for spots to accumulate chips.\n4. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 is very tight/passive. They fold a lot preflop and play weak post-flop.\n5. **Pot Odds**: Calling 16 to win 48 = 3:1 odds. Not terrible, but we need to hit something.\n6. **Tournament**: Need to preserve stack but also look for spots to chip up against weak players.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Safest option. Q5s is weak, and we don't want to bleed chips.\n- **Call**: Cheap at 16 chips, but we're out of position post-flop (we're actually in position as BTN vs BB). We have 3:1 pot odds.\n- **Raise**: Min raise is 64 (2BB). Given opponent folds a lot preflop, this could be a good steal attempt.\n\n**Recommendation**: \nGiven that MiniMax-M2 is extremely tight (folds 80% preflop) and never raises preflop, a steal raise from the button seems profitable. However, with Q5s and 17.9BB, we should be careful about risking too many chips.\n\nActually, wait - I'm on the Button posting the SB, and MiniMax-M2 is in the BB. So I have position post-flop. The opponent is very tight and folds a lot. A raise here is a good steal attempt, but Q5s is really weak.\n\nLet me reconsider: With 17.9BB, I should be more conservative. While a raise could steal the blinds, if called I'm in trouble with Q5s. The opponent calls about 20% of the time, and when they do, they have something decent.\n\nI think the best play is to **fold**. Q5s is just too weak to play even against a tight opponent with a shortish stack. I should save my chips for a better spot.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. It's only 16 more chips (0.5BB) to call, I'm on the button, and the opponent is very tight/passive. The pot odds are good (3:1), and I have position. Maybe calling is okay to see a flop.\n\nBut with 17.9BB, I should be thinking about push/fold in many spots. Q5s is not a hand I want to play post-flop OOP... wait, I AM in position (Button vs BB).\n\nHmm, I'm conflicted:\n- Fold: Safest, preserves chips\n- Call: Cheap, good position, 3:1 odds\n- Raise: Good steal attempt vs tight opponent\n\nGiven the opponent's extreme tightness (80% preflop folds) and passivity, I think a **raise to 64** is actually the best play. It's a standard button steal against a tight BB. If they call, I can evaluate the flop, but they'll likely fold.\n\nWait, but with Q5s and 17.9BB, maybe that's too aggressive. Let me think tournament strategy: At <20BB, I should be more selective. But stealing blinds is crucial.\n\nI think I'll go with a **fold**. Q5s is just too weak, and while the opponent is tight, I don't want to risk 64 chips (3.5% of my stack) on a marginal steal with a weak hand. I'll wait for a better spot.",

Let me look at their tendencies from the data I retrieved:\n\nFrom the opponent actions:\n- They fold a lot preflop (many folds)\n- When they do call, they sometimes fold on later streets (hand 94: called preflop, folded flop)\n- They don't seem to be very aggressive based on the limited aggressive actions shown\n\n**My analysis:**\n1. **My hand is complete garbage** - I have 6-high on a board with multiple cards that could easily make pairs, straights, etc.\n2. **I've been betting as if I have something** - I bet flop and turn, representing strength\n3. **Opponent has called twice** - This suggests they have something, even if it's marginal\n4. **I cannot win at showdown** - My 6-high will never win against any pair or even Ace-high\n5. **Checking is the only sensible option** - I need to see if they'll check back and give me a free showdown, or if they'll bet and I can fold\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I'm short-stacked with 9.2 BB\n- The pot is already large (554 chips)\n- I cannot afford to bluff off more chips with complete air\n- I need to preserve my stack for better spots\n\n**Conclusion:**\nI should check and hope the opponent checks back. If they bet, I must fold. Raising would be suicidal with 6-high - I have no equity and would just be throwing away chips. This is a clear check/fold spot.\n\nThe opponent has shown they can call bets, so they likely have some piece of the board. I need to minimize my losses here.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with 44\n- Flop is 7s 7c Qd - paired board\n- Only opponent left is MiniMax-M2 in BB with 96 chips (3 BB)\n- Pot is 64 chips\n- MiniMax checked to me\n- I can check or bet\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have pocket 4s on a 7-7-Q board\n- This is a terrible board for me - the pair of 7s means any 7 beats me, and the Q is a high card that likely connects with opponent's range\n- I have no draw, no pair, and my hand is essentially worthless here\n- The only way I win is if opponent has complete air and I bluff them off\n\n**Opponent analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the recall data, MiniMax-M2 has:\n- Been very tight - folding preflop most of the time\n- When they do play (hands 86, 88, 94, 96), they tend to be passive\n- In hand 96, they called flop, turn, and checked river - showing they can call with some hands\n- They have a short stack (3 BB) and are in survival mode\n\n**Strategic considerations:**\n- With 818 chips (25.6 BB), I'm relatively healthy\n- MiniMax only has 96 chips and is likely playing tight/survival poker\n- The board is scary (paired) which is actually good for bluffing\n- However, bluffing a short-stacked opponent who is likely to call with any piece is risky\n- Pot is only 64 chips, not worth risking much to win\n- If I bet and get called, I'm likely drawing dead\n- Checking gives me a free chance to hit a 4 (though unlikely)\n- Checking also gives MiniMax a chance to bluff on turn if they have nothing\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check here. My hand has almost no equity, the opponent is short-stacked and likely to call with any pair or decent hand, and the risk/reward of bluffing isn't favorable. I have a healthy stack and don't need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n\nI'll maintain my chip stack by taking a cautious approach, recognizing the unfavorable board texture and opponent's potential range. Checking allows me to preserve my chips while minimizing risk in this low-equity situation.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the Button with 44\n- Board: 7s 7c Qd 2c Qh (paired board with QQ77)\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- My stack: 818 chips (25.6 BB)\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 with 96 chips (3 BB)\n- Action: MiniMax-M2 checked on the river\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have pocket 4s. The board is QQ772 with no flush possible. My hand is 44 on a QQ772 board.\n\nPossible hands MiniMax-M2 could have:\n- Any Queen (beats me): Qx hands like QK, QJ, QT, Q9, Q8, Q7, Q6, Q5, Q4, Q3, Q2\n- Any 7 (beats me): 7x hands\n- Any pocket pair 55-66, 88-JJ (beats me)\n- Pocket 22 (beats me with a full house)\n- Pocket 44 (chops with me)\n- Pocket 33, 55-66 (loses to me)\n- Ace high, King high, etc. (I beat these)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall, MiniMax-M2 has been:\n- Folding preflop frequently (hands 78, 80, 82, 84, 89, 90, 91, 92)\n- Calling preflop occasionally (hands 86, 88, 94, 96)\n- In hand 88: Called preflop, then check-check-check (showdown not shown, but likely weak)\n- In hand 94: Called preflop, folded on flop\n- In hand 96: Called preflop, called flop (32), called turn (213), checked river - this was a big pot\n\nThe opponent is short-stacked with only 96 chips (3 BB). They've checked to me on the river.\n\n**My hand strength:** With 44 on a QQ772 board, I have two pair, fours and queens (sevens on board). But any Queen, any 7, any pocket pair 55+, or 22 beats me. Given the action (check-check-check-check), it's possible my opponent has:\n- A weak queen that they're scared to bet\n- A missed draw\n- A small pocket pair worse than mine\n- Complete air\n\n**Pot odds:** The pot is 64 chips. If I bet, I need to consider that my opponent only has 96 chips total, so the maximum I can win is 64 + 96 = 160 chips if they call/shove.\n\n**Decision:** With a short-stacked opponent who has shown weakness by checking, and given that I have a decent but vulnerable hand, I should consider a value bet. However, my hand is quite weak on this board texture - many hands beat me.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. The board is QQ772. I have 44. What hands would MiniMax-M2:\n1. Call preflop with from BB?\n2. Check flop, turn, and river with?\n\nPossible hands:\n- Qx hands: Would likely bet for value on river\n- 7x hands: Would likely bet for value on river\n- Pocket pairs 55-JJ: Might check down if they think I'm bluffing\n- Pocket 33: Might check down\n- Ace high: Might check down\n- King high: Might check down\n\nGiven that they checked the river, they likely don't have a strong hand like a Queen or 7. They could have a pocket pair 55-JJ, or they could have complete air.\n\nBut wait - if they have 55-JJ, they beat me! So I'm actually in a bad spot. I'm only beating:\n- 33\n- Ace high\n- King high\n- Other air\n\nAnd I'm losing to:\n- Any Queen\n- Any 7\n- 22 (full house)\n- Any pocket pair 55-JJ\n\nGiven this analysis, my hand is actually quite weak. I should check back and try to get to showdown cheaply. There's no value in betting because:\n1. Better hands will call (any pocket pair 55+)\n2. Worse hands will fold (Ace high, King high)\n3. I'm only getting called by better hands\n\nThe only reason to bet would be as a thin value bet if I think they'll call with Ace-high or King-high, but that's too optimistic.\n\n**Conclusion:** I should check back and see if my 44 is good at showdown. This is a clear check situation.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Based on MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n\n1. They fold preflop most of the time (80% fold rate)\n2. When they do play, they're generally passive (checking, calling)\n3. In Hand #96, they called large bets on turn and river but still checked at showdown\n4. They haven't shown any aggressive betting patterns\n\nGiven this information, MiniMax-M2 is likely a very tight, passive player who rarely bluffs and only plays strong hands.\n\nOn this board (QQ772), my 44 is very weak. The only hands I'm beating are pure bluffs or hands like 33, A-high, K-high, etc. Given MiniMax-M2's tight/passive nature, if they had any pair (55+, 22), any Queen, or any 7, they would likely have bet by now, especially on the river. The fact that they've checked all the way suggests they either have complete air or a very marginal hand.\n\nHowever, given their tight nature, I should be cautious. They might have been slow-playing a monster like Qx or 77, but that seems unlikely given their passive pattern. They might also have a small pocket pair (55-66, 88-JJ) that's scared of the Queens.\n\nWith the pot at 64 chips and MiniMax-M2 having 96 chips total, I could try a small value bet. But I don't have much showdown value with 44. A bluff might work, but it's risky against a tight player who might call with any pair.\n\nI think the best play is to check and hope to win at showdown. If they have air, I'll win. If they have a marginal hand, they might call a bet anyway. Checking is the safest option.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I'm in the BTN position with 2c Ts. Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 2c Ts is a very weak hand. It's an offsuit hand with a low card (2) and a mid card (T). This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is the best position post-flop, but this doesn't compensate for the terrible hand strength.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 818 chips (25.6 BB), which is a healthy stack. I shouldn't risk chips with a weak hand.\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**: MiniMax-M2 is in the BB with 112 chips (3.5 BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They fold preflop frequently (hands 86, 89, 90, 91, 92, 98)\n   - When they do play, they tend to be passive (lots of checking, calling small bets)\n   - They called a 213 chip bet on the turn in hand 96, suggesting they can have decent hands\n   - Overall, they seem tight-passive\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 chips to win a pot of 48 chips. That's 3:1 pot odds, which might seem tempting, but with 2c Ts, I'm very likely dominated even if I hit something.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With a 25.6 BB stack, I'm in decent shape. I don't need to take marginal spots. Folding weak hands from the BTN is fine, especially when the BB is short-stacked and might shove.\n\n7. **The BB's stack**: MiniMax-M2 only has 112 chips (3.5 BB). If I call, they could easily shove all-in, and I'd have to fold anyway, losing the 16 chips.\n\nThe only argument for playing this hand would be if the BB is extremely tight and folds to steals often. But looking at their history, while they do fold a lot, they also call sometimes. And with their short stack, they're more likely to defend or shove.\n\nGiven the terrible hand strength, my decent stack size, and the risk of the short-stacked BB shoving, this is a clear fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in BB with Js Jd (pocket jacks)\n- My stack: 786 chips (24.6 BB)\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 96 chips\n- Only opponent: MiniMax-M2 in SB with 96 chips\n- Action: MiniMax-M2 posted SB (16), I posted BB (32), then MiniMax-M2 raised to 64\n\n**Amount to call:** 32 (the raise is 64 total, I already have 32 in)\n**Minimum raise to:** 96\n**Legal actions:** fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the search results, I see MiniMax-M2's patterns:\n- Hand 86: Called from SB, then folded to my raise\n- Hand 88: Called from SB, played passively postflop\n- Hand 89: Folded to my BTN raise\n- Hand 90: Folded SB\n- Hand 91: Folded to my BTN raise\n- Hand 92: Folded SB\n- Hand 94: Called from SB, folded to flop bet\n- Hand 96: Called from SB, called flop, called turn (this was a big pot where I won)\n- Hand 97: Checked from BB (when I was BTN)\n- Hand 98: Folded SB\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 is generally passive, often folding to aggression. They sometimes call preflop but fold to continuation bets. In hand 96 they called down with Td Kh but lost.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Pocket jacks are a strong hand, especially heads-up\n- I'm out of position (BB vs SB)\n- MiniMax-M2 has only 96 chips total (3 BB), so they're short-stacked\n- Their raise to 64 is a min-raise (2x the BB)\n- The pot is 96 chips and I need to call 32, giving me 3:1 pot odds\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: JJ is a premium hand, especially against a short stack\n2. **Position**: Bad position (BB), but with JJ and a short stack opponent, this matters less\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: MiniMax-M2 is passive and often folds to pressure. Their min-raise could be weak\n4. **Stack sizes**: If I raise, I could put them all-in. They have 96 total, already put in 64, so they have 32 left\n5. **Pot odds**: Getting 3:1 to call, which is great for JJ\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Terrible with JJ against a short stack\n- **Call**: Could see a flop, but I'm out of position and they'd have only 32 left\n- **Raise**: Best option. I can raise to 96 (which puts them all-in) or just raise to isolate\n\nIf I raise to 96, they're getting pot odds of:\n- Pot would be: 96 (current) + 32 (my additional) = 128\n- They need to call: 32\n- Pot odds: 4:1\n\nWith any decent hand, they might call. And with JJ, I want to get value and deny equity.\n\nActually, let me recalculate: If I raise to 96 total:\n- I've already put in 32\n- I need to add 64 more\n- They have 96 total, already put in 64\n- They need to call 32 more to match 96\n\nWait, the minimum raise is 96 TOTAL (not additional). So:\n- Current pot: 96 (16+32+48 raise)\n- To raise to 96 means I'm putting in 96 total\n- I've already put in 32\n- So I need to add 64 more\n- MiniMax-M2 has put in 64 total so far\n- If I raise to 96, they would need to call 32 more (96-64=32)\n- They have exactly 32 left in their stack (96 total - 64 already in = 32)\n\nSo raising to 96 puts them all-in!\n\nThis is perfect. With JJ against a short stack who is passive, I should definitely raise to put them all-in. This is a standard play.\n\nThe reasoning: JJ is a strong hand that plays well against a short stack's range. By raising to 96, I put maximum pressure and give them a tough decision. If they call, I'm likely ahead of their range, and I don't have to play out of position on later streets.\n\nLet me make the raise to 96.",

If I want to put them all-in, I should raise to at least 64.\n\nActually, since they only have 64 chips and the pot is 192, I should try to extract value. The minimum raise is 32, but I can raise more. If I raise to 64, that would match their stack and likely get them all-in.\n\nWait, the \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests there's no bet to call on the flop. Let me reconsider the chip counts:\n- Pot is 192\n- Seat 4 has 64 chips currently\n- If I bet/raise, I want to put them all-in\n\nThe minimum raise is 32, but I can raise to any amount up to my stack. To put Seat 4 all-in, I should raise to at least 64.\n\nLet me make a decision: I have two pair on a dangerous board against a short stack. I should bet for value and protection. I'll raise to 64 to put pressure and likely get them all-in.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 64,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have two pair (jacks and sixes) on a dangerous board with potential trips and flush draws.

The minimum raise is 32, but \"raise_to\" means the total amount I put in, not the additional amount. If I raise to 64, I'm betting 64 chips. Given the pot is 192 and opponent has 64, a 64-chip bet is about 1/3 pot, which is reasonable.\n\nBut wait - if the minimum raise is 32, and I can raise to any amount above that, raising to 64 seems good. However, I need to be careful - if they have a six, I'm drawing almost dead. But with two pair against a short stack's wide range, I'm likely ahead.\n\nLet me finalize my decision: Raise to 64 to put pressure on the short stack and get value from my two pair.",

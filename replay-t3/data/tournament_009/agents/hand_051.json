Seems to be a somewhat tight/passive player.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Very passive, has folded preflop multiple times (hands 47, 49, 50), and when they do see flops, they're checking through. Very tight/passive.\n\nWith 8-3 offsuit, this is one of the worst starting hands in poker. Even in position, this is an easy fold. The hand has:\n- No high card value\n- No suitedness\n- No connectivity (gap of 5 cards)\n- Very low potential to make strong hands\n\nGiven I'm on the button, I could theoretically try to steal with any two cards against weak opponents, but 8-3 offsuit is just too weak. Even if both opponents fold 70% of the time, the risk/reward isn't worth it with this hand.\n\nThe pot is only 12 chips (1.5 BB), so there's not much to fight for. Better to preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\nDecision: FOLD",

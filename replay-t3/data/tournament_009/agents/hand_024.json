King high but very marginal.\n\n2. **Position**: BB (Big Blind) - Not ideal position post-flop.\n\n3. **Action**: \n   - MiniMax-M2 raised from 4 to 8 (minimum raise of 4)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B called from SB\n   - I need to call 4 more chips to see the flop\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: \n   - Me: 294 chips (73.5 BB)\n   - MiniMax-M2: 185 chips (46.25 BB)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B: 300 chips (75 BB)\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - MiniMax-M2: Very tight! Only raised once in recent 9 hands (hand #19), folded preflop 8 out of 10 times. When they did play (hand #16), they were aggressive post-flop with betting.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B: Somewhat tight but more active. They've folded preflop 7 out of 10 times, but they raised once (hand #20) and played post-flop aggressively in hand #18.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: \n   - Current pot: 20 chips\n   - Amount to call: 4 chips\n   - Pot odds: 20:4 or 5:1\n\n7. **Analysis**:\n   - I have a trash hand (K3o) that plays very poorly post-flop\n   - MiniMax-M2's raise suggests a strong hand given their tight nature\n   - GPT-OSS-120B's call could be with a wide range from the SB\n   - The pot odds are decent (5:1) but this hand has very poor equity\n   - Even if I hit a King, I'll often be dominated by better kickers\n   - I'm out of position against two players\n   - Given the tight nature of MiniMax-M2, their raising range is likely strong (pairs, strong broadway hands)\n\nThe pot odds are tempting but this hand is just too weak and I'll be out of position. The combination of a tight raiser and being OOP makes this an easy fold. I don't want to invest chips with such a marginal hand that will be difficult to play post-flop.\n\nEven though I'm getting 5:1 on my call, the reverse implied odds (losing more when I'm dominated) and poor playability make this a clear fold.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have hand #24 preflop. Position: SB, we posted 2. BB posted 4. Player in Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8 (so raise of 4 from BB? Actually they raised 8 total, which is 4 over BB? Wait: blinds 2/4, SB posted 2, BB posted 4, then MiniMax-M2 (Seat4) raised 8, meaning they put 8 total (i.e., 4 raise). So amount to call is 6 (since we have 2 posted, need to put total 8, so 6 more). Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise at least to 12 total). Our hand: Ah Ts (Ace Ten suited). Stack 306 chips, 76.5 BB. We are in SB, out of position post-flop.\n\nWe need to decide fold, call, raise.\n\nConsider hand strength: Ace Ten suited is a decent hand, especially in early position? In SB, but out of position. In tournament with 76 BB, still deep. Facing a raise from MP? Actually seat4 maybe MP? Not sure. Opponent's tendencies: we saw MiniMax-M2 raised preflop 4 (small raise) in hand 19. Also raised on flop 8 in hand 9. Not much data. Could be a loose raiser.\n\nWe have 6 to call, pot is 14 (2+4+8). Effective stack after call: 306-6 = 300 left, still deep. Ace Ten suited has good equity vs random raise (~35% vs a random 2-5 range). If opponent is raising a wide range, we could call and see flop. Raising could be to isolate and get value if they are weaker. Minimum raise to 12 would be 12 total, i.e., raise additional 4 (since we need to put 12 total). That would be a 4 raise over call (so 6 to call + 4 = 10 extra). Actually raise_to is total amount we put in: currently we have posted 2, need to put 12 total, so need 10 more chips. That's a raise of 10? Wait: legal raise to 12 means total bet after raise is 12. Since we already have 2 posted, we need to put 10 more. That would be a raise of 4 over call (call 6, raise extra 4). So raise to 12 is small. Could also go all-in but not needed.\n\nGiven deep stack, raising could isolate and build pot with a strong hand. Ace Ten suited can make top pair, straight, flush. But also can be dominated by AK, AQ, etc. In SB, out of position, raising may be okay to take initiative.\n\nBut opponent's raise size is small (8 total). This could be a steal attempt from MP. If we raise, we could push them out or get heads-up. Our hand is decent but not premium. Many players would just call or fold. Considering tournament, preserving stack is okay. With 76 BB, we can afford to call.\n\nThus best action: call. Reason: decent hand, deep stack, want to see flop, out of position, small raise, opponent likely wide, we can see cheap flop.\n\nThus output JSON.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have flop Jd 9h 6c. Our hand Ah Ts: we have gutshot straight draw (needs Q for open-ended? Actually we have A T, board J 9 6. We have open-ended straight draw? Cards: 6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A. With T and J on board, we have 10-J, need Q or 8? Wait we have T, board J,9,6. Straight possibilities: 6-7-8-9-10 (need 8 or 7?), we have T, board 9,6, J. Actually 6-7-8-9-10: we have 10,9,6, missing 7 and 8. Not open. 7-8-9-10-J: we have T,J, need 7 and 8. Not open. 8-9-10-J-Q: we have T,J, need Q and 8. So need both 8 and Q? That's two cards, not a draw. So we have only a pair of Ace high? Actually no pair. We have Ace high with a gutshot? Wait we have A T, board J 9 6. No pair. We have backdoor flush draw? Suits: Ah (hearts), Ts (spades). Board hearts: Jd, 9h, 6c. One heart on board (9h). So we have backdoor flush draw (need two hearts). Not strong.\n\nMiniMax-M2 raised preflop to 8 (from BB). We called. So they likely have a range of strong hands, maybe broadway, pairs, suited connectors. On flop J 9 6, they bet? Actually it's our turn. The actions list shows only preflop actions; now it's flop with amount to call 0. So it's our turn after they raised preflop and we called, then flop action order: first to act is the raiser (MiniMax-M2) because they are in position? Actually seat 4 is MP? Seat 5 is BB (us). The flop action order: first to act is seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) because they were the preflop aggressor. But the actions list doesn't show flop actions yet. So now it's our turn with amount to call 0 (meaning MiniMax-M2 checked? Actually the pot is 20 chips (preflop: 4+8+2? Wait preflop: SB 2, BB 4, raise to 8 (so 8 total?), call 6, so pot = 2+4+8+6 = 20). So after flop, no bet yet. So it's our action first? Actually if MiniMax-M2 acted first and they checked, then amount to call is 0 for us. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need decide: check or raise. Hand is weak. Likely check. Could consider a small raise as bluff? But opponent may call with wide range. Our stack 300, pot 20, raise min 4 to 24 total? Actually raise to total amount: minimum raise to 4 chips more than call? Since call is 0, minimum raise to 4? The legal raise amount is total 4? Usually raise must be at least double the previous bet, but here no bet, so min bet is big blind amount? It says Minimum raise to: 4. So we could bet 4 chips.\n\nShould we bet as a continuation? Our hand has no equity, but we could try to steal pot. Opponent raised preflop, so likely has strong hand, not likely to fold to 4 chips. Might be okay to check and see turn.\n\nThus check.\n\nReasoning: weak hand, no showdown value, opponent likely strong, preserve chips.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Suits: board hearts 9h, clubs 6c, diamonds Jd. Our hearts: Ah, so one heart. Not many flush draws.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) raised preflop to 8 (from SB? Actually seat 4 is in MP? Anyway). He bet 4 on flop (small). We have checked, now facing 4 bet into pot 24. So pot after bet will be 28 (24+4). Our stack 300, deep.\n\nWe need to decide fold, call, raise. Hand strength: We have Ace high, gutshot to QJ? Actually board J-9-6, we have A T, we have open-ended? No, we have straight draw: need Q for straight (J Q T 9 8? Wait we have T, board J 9 6. To make straight we need Q and 8? Let's see combos: 6-7-8-9-10? We have T, board 9,6. Need 7 and 8 for that. Not possible. Another: 9-10-J-Q-K? We have T, board J, need Q and K? Actually T-J-Q-K-A? We have A T, board J. To make straight we need Q and K? Sequence 10-J-Q-K-A uses T,J,Q,K,A. We have T, J (board), A (hand), need Q and K. So need both Q and K, two cards, not a gutshot. So we have no straight draw. Wait we have T and A, board J9 6. We have pair? No. We have Ace high. So basically we have nothing, just Ace high. So likely we should fold to bet.\n\nBut consider opponent's betting pattern: He bet small 4 on flop. Could be continuation bet with a wide range, maybe we can call with Ace high? In tournament with deep stacks, maybe we can call to see turn cheaply. But also we have 300 chips, 75 BB, deep. Opponent's raise preflop to 8 (3x BB). He could have J, 9, 6 combos, overpairs, etc. He bet 4, small. Could be a c-bet with any hand, but also could be a draw.\n\nOur hand Ah Ts is not strong, but Ace high is decent vs unknown. However, we are out of position (BB). After calling, we will be out of position on turn and river. Might be okay to fold.\n\nWe can also consider raising to protect? Not advisable with weak hand.\n\nThus fold is likely best.\n\nCheck opponent's tendencies: Past actions: He bet 4 on flop previously (hand 16). Also raised 8 on flop (hand 9). So sometimes he raises bigger. But his small bet here suggests maybe weak or drawing. Our Ace high may be best but still weak. Considering tournament, preserving chips is important.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\n"

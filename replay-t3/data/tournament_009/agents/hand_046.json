History shows they tend to bet when they have something (bet 20 on flop/turn in hand #40, bet 8 on flop in hand #43), but also fold preflop frequently. They've folded in 3 of the last 5 hands preflop.\n- **GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5)**: Small blind. They check on the flop now. History shows they fold preflop a lot, but have made some raises (20 and 24 chips). In hand #43, they called preflop, checked flop, then folded to a bet.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Both opponents checked to me\n- Amount to call is 0, so I can check for free\n- The pot is small (24 chips)\n- I have 377 chips (47 BB) - healthy stack\n\n**Decision:**\nI have complete air. There's no reason to bet here:\n1. My hand has 0% equity against any pair\n2. I have no draws or backdoor possibilities\n3. Both opponents have shown weakness by checking\n4. If I bet, I'd be bluffing with no equity and no fold equity against any pair\n5. Checking costs nothing and I can see if I improve on the turn (though it's very unlikely with a 3 and T)\n\nThe only consideration might be a bluff bet to try to take down the small pot, but with two opponents and a King on board, it's very likely at least one has a King or pair.

Just a 3 and a 10, with a board showing 8-2-K-5. No pair, no straight draw (would need a J and Q or 6 and 7), no flush draw. This is a complete air hand.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n\nFrom MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):\n- Folded preflop in hands 41, 42, 44, 45 (tight)\n- Called preflop and bet on flop in hand 43 (seems to bet when they have something)\n- In hand 40, they bet 20 on flop and turn (showing aggression)\n- Overall: Plays tight preflop, but bets when they enter pots\n\nFrom GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5):\n- Very tight preflop - folded in hands 37, 38, 39, 40, 42\n- Raised preflop in hands 41 and 44\n- Called preflop in hand 43 but folded on flop\n- Overall: Very tight player, only plays strong hands\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Both opponents checked on the flop and the turn (Seat 5 checked turn)\n- This suggests weakness from both players\n- The pot is small (24 chips)\n- I have nothing, but I am in position (acting last)\n\n**Options:**\n1. Check - Showdown with my high card 10 (likely losing)\n2. Bet (bluff) - Try to steal the pot\n\nGiven that both opponents have shown weakness by checking twice, and considering their tight tendencies, a small bluff might work here. However, I need to consider:\n\n- MiniMax has shown they can bet, so they might call or raise if they have any piece\n- GPT-OSS is very tight and likely folds without a strong hand\n- The board has a K, which is scary and might make them fold marginal hands\n\nWith my complete air hand, checking is the safe play. However, this is a tournament and I need to accumulate chips. A small bluff bet could take down this pot.\n\nLet me think about bet sizing: Minimum raise is 8 chips (to 16 total). The pot is 24, so a bet of around 16-20 chips would be a reasonable bluff size.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions more carefully: \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this means the minimum TOTAL amount I can put in is 8 chips (so a bet of 8). But that doesn't make sense given the pot is 24. Let me re-read...\n\n\"Amount to call: 0\" - so it's checked to me. \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this likely means minimum BET is 8 (to add to the existing pot).\n\nGiven I have nothing, but both opponents have shown weakness, and this is a tournament where I need to accumulate chips, I could make a small bluff here. However, the risk is that one of them might have a piece and call or raise.\n\nWith complete air on a K-high board, I think checking is the correct play. I have no equity, no draw, and while the opponents have shown weakness, bluffing with absolutely nothing is generally not profitable long-term, especially when I can see a free showdown with my 10-high (which might occasionally be good if both opponents have complete air too).\n\nLet me check again - the board is K-8-5-2. My 10-high is unlikely to be good at showdown. So checking is just giving up on the pot.\n\nBut wait - both players checked the flop AND the turn. This is a strong indicator of weakness. A small bet might take this down. In tournaments, you need to win these small pots.\n\nI think a small bluff of around 16-20 chips could be profitable here. Let me go with 16 chips (which would be a raise to 16 total).\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise again: \"Minimum raise to: 8\". Given the context and that the pot is 24, I think this might mean the minimum ADDITIONAL amount is 8 (so bet 8 chips). But that seems too small to be meaningful.\n\nLet me reconsider the format. When it says \"Minimum raise to: 8\", and the current pot is 24, I think it's saying the minimum total bet is 8 chips, which would be a very small bet. More likely, it's saying the minimum bet size is 8 chips.\n\nI'll interpret"

But the pot is 24 chips, which is worth fighting for.\n\nGiven both opponents' tight/passive tendencies and the fact they've checked twice, I think a small bluff is profitable here. I'll bet about 2/3 pot (16 chips).\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Looking at the legal actions: \"Minimum raise to: 8\" - this is confusing. If the pot is 24 and it's checked to me, I should be able to bet. The \"raise_to\" field suggests I need to specify the total amount I'm putting in.\n\nGiven the pot is 24 and it's checked to me, if I want to bet 16 chips, that would be a \"raise_to\" of 16 (total amount).\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The format says:\n- \"raise_to\": <number if raising, otherwise null>\n- \"You can only raise if 'raise' is in your legal_actions\"\n\nSince \"raise\" is in my legal_actions, I can bet. If I want to bet 16 chips, I would set \"raise_to\": 16.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't seem right. Usually in poker notation, \"raise to\" means the total amount. So if the current bet is 0 (checked to me), and I want to bet 16, I would be raising to 16.\n\nLet me go with a conservative approach. Both opponents are tight and have shown weakness. A small bluff is appropriate. I'll bet 16 chips (about 2/3 pot).\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. Looking at the hand history:\n- Seat 5 posted SB of 4\n- Seat 1 (me) posted BB of 8\n- Seat 4 called 8\n- Seat 5 called 4 (completing the call)\n- I checked\n\nSo the pot should be: 8 (my BB) + 8 (Seat 4 call) + 8 (Seat 5 call) = 24. That matches.\n\nNow on the turn, it's checked to me. I can check or bet. If I want to bet, I need to \"raise\" since I'm increasing the bet from 0.\n\nIf the minimum raise is 8, that means the minimum BET is 8 chips. So I could bet anywhere from 8 to my entire stack.\n\nGiven I have complete air, but both opponents have shown weakness, I think a small bluff of 16 chips is appropriate. This is about 2/3 pot and should be enough to get folds from marginal hands.\n\nLet me make a decision: I'll bet 16 chips as a bluff.",

However, they also show some weakness by folding post-flop in hand 43.\n\n6. **Considerations**:\n   - A7 suited is a reasonable hand from the button\n   - I'm getting good pot odds to call (8 chips to win 12 = 2:1 odds)\n   - If I raise, minimum is 16 chips total, which would be about 5.5% of my stack\n   - Tournament considerations: I should be selective but can take some risks to build stack\n\n7. **Decision factors**:\n   - The hand is playable from button\n   - Pot odds are good for a call\n   - Opponent seems to be in a raising pattern recently\n   - I have position which gives me an advantage\n   \nI'm leaning towards calling to see the flop cheaply. The button position and decent hand strength support this approach. While an opponent might raise, the potential reward outweighs the risk. The cheap call allows me to potentially hit a strong hand or leverage positional advantage post-flop.",

Since both opponents showed weakness by checking, I could consider a small bet to take the pot down. However, my kicker is very weak, and if either opponent has a better Ace or any pair, I'm behind.\n\nGiven the passive tendencies of both opponents and my weak hand strength, the most prudent play is to check and see if I can win with just Ace high at showdown.

Tends to be passive.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Mix of betting and checking on flop, seems to bet when checking is more common (6 bets vs 5 checks/folds)\n\nMy hand analysis:\n- I have Ace high with a weak kicker (7h)\n- The board is 8s 2h Kc - very disconnected, no obvious draws\n- I have position on both opponents\n- This is a weak hand, essentially Ace high\n\nGiven that both opponents checked on the flop, they likely have weak hands too. With my weak Ace high, I should be looking to check behind and see if I can win at showdown with just the Ace, or potentially improve on later streets.\n\nHowever, I could also consider a small bet to try to take the pot down immediately since both opponents showed weakness by checking. But with such a weak kicker, I'm not confident in this hand's strength.\n\nGiven the passive nature of both opponents (especially Kimi-K2 who mostly checks), and my weak hand, the most prudent play is to check and hope to win with Ace high at showdown, or fold if faced with significant aggression later.\n\n\nThe pot's modest size and my limited chip stack suggest a cautious approach. With just 24 chips in the pot and 35.6 big blinds in my stack, I'm better off preserving my chips for a stronger hand.

Actually order after flop: SB first (seat5), then seat1 (BB), then seat4 (MP?). Actually seat4 is after seat1? The order is SB, BB, then UTG? But seat4 is MP maybe after BB. But currently only SB and BB and seat4 are still in. The flop is 8s 2h Kc. Our hand Ah 9c: we have Ace high, 9 kicker. No pair, no draw (straight draw? 8-9-10-J-Q? Not possible). No flush draw (two spades? we have Ah (heart) and 9c (club). Board has spade 8, heart 2, club K. So we have backdoor possibilities but weak.\n\nWe need to decide check or raise. Opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 has raised on flop before (hand 28 raised 40). That suggests they can be aggressive, maybe continuation bet. Kimi-K2 is BB, hasn't acted yet. Their raise pattern preflop is small raises (12) and occasional big (105). Not much flop data.\n\nGiven our weak hand, likely check. But consider possibility of a bluff raise? Our stack 300, pot 24. Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total? Actually raise to total amount; current bet is 0, so raise to 8 means bet 8). That's a small raise. Could be a steal attempt, but we are SB with weak hand. Opponents may call with any pair or better. Might be risky.\n\nBetter to check and see what BB does. If BB bets, we can consider folding.\n\nThus decision: check.\n\nWe need JSON.",

No flush draw (two spades? we have Ah,9c; board has spade 8, others none). So essentially just Ace high.\n\nOpponent seats: Seat 1 Kimi-K2 with 377 chips, seat 4 MiniMax-M2 with 285 chips. Both still in. Preflop: Seat 5 (us) posted SB 4, seat 1 posted BB 8, seat4 called 8, seat5 called 4 (so we just called SB). Then seat1 checked, flop check all around.

Actually order: seat5 is SB, seat1 BB, seat4 UTG? Not sure but actions: we are seat5 (SB). After flop checks, it's turn, and actions order: seat5 first (SB), then seat1, then seat4? Usually order is from SB clockwise. So we act first.\n\nWe have Ace high, not strong. Opponents have larger stacks (377, 285). We have 300. Likely they have stronger hands (maybe pair, two pair, etc). Should we check and see what they do? If we check and they bet, we may have to fold. Could we raise as a bluff? Our stack 300, pot 24, raise to at least 8 (minimum). Could try a small raise to take pot. But with Ace high, risk.\n\nConsider tournament stage: we have 37.5 BB, decent stack. Should preserve chips.

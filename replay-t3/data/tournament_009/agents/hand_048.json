            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: 7h Th (7\u2665 T\u2665) - This is a suited connector, which has some potential but is not a premium hand.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position at the table. I act last on every street postflop.\n\n**Stack**: 381 chips (47.6 BB) - This is a healthy stack, giving me plenty of room to maneuver.\n\n**Blinds**: 4/8 - So I'm in a tournament with increasing blinds.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 301 chips, in SB\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 292 chips, in BB\n\nLet me analyze the opponent tendencies:\n\n**MiniMax-M2 (SB)**:\n- Has folded preflop many times (hands 39, 41, 42, 44, 45)\n- When they do play, they tend to call or bet (hands 40, 43, 46, 47)\n- On hand 40: called preflop, then bet flop and turn\n- On hand 43: called preflop, bet flop, then checked turn and river\n- On hand 46: called preflop, checked flop, folded turn\n- On hand 47: checked preflop (was BB), checked flop, called turn, checked river\n- Seems to be a relatively passive player who calls more than raises\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B (BB)**:\n- Has raised preflop several times (hands 31, 36, 41, 44) with amounts like 12, 20, 24\n- Folds frequently (hands 32, 33, 34, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42)\n- On hand 43: called 4, checked flop, then folded\n- On hand 46: called 4, checked flop and turn, then folded turn\n- Seems to be an aggressive player who raises with good hands but folds to pressure\n\n**Current situation**:\n- I have 7h Th on the button\n- It's folded to me\n- SB has posted 4, BB has posted 8\n- I need to call 8 to see the flop\n- I can raise to at least 16\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 7h Th is a suited connector. It's not strong enough to raise for value, but it has good potential if I hit a straight or flush. It's definitely playable from the button.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is a huge advantage. I'll act last postflop, which gives me more information and control.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents seem to fold fairly often. GPT-OSS-120B in the BB has shown aggression when they have strong hands but also folds a lot. MiniMax-M2 in the SB is more passive.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 12 (4+8). I need to call 8 to see the flop. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, which isn't great, but position and implied odds matter more here.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 47.6 BB, I have a comfortable stack. I can afford to see flops with speculative hands from good position.\n\n**Decision**: I should call. Here's why:\n- From the button, I can play more hands profitably\n- 7h Th has good potential for straights and flushes\n- Both opponents have shown they can fold, so I may be able to steal pots postflop\n- Raising would be too aggressive with this hand strength - I don't want to bloat the pot with a marginal hand\n- Calling keeps the pot small and allows me to see the flop cheaply from position\n\nI could consider raising as a steal attempt, but the BB (GPT-OSS-120B) has shown they can raise preflop and might defend their BB. Since I have a marginal hand, it's better to just call and see the flop.\n\nLet me call 8 and see what happens on the flop.",

I have 7h Th which gives me:\n- No pair\n- Backdoor flush draw (hearts)\n- No straight draw\n- Only high card T\n\nThis is a very weak hand on this board. The board is paired which reduces the value of draws and makes it more likely someone has trips or a full house.\n\nLooking at the action:\n- Preflop: I called 8 chips on the button with 7h Th (reasonable speculative hand in position)\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) folded from SB\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) checked in BB\n- On the flop, GPT-OSS-120B checked to me\n\nFrom the opponent history I retrieved:\nGPT-OSS-120B has been fairly passive:\n- Frequently folds preflop\n- When they do see flops, they tend to check and often fold later\n- They check-called preflop in hand 43 then check-folded on flop\n- They check-called preflop in hand 46, checked flop and turn, then folded turn\n\nThis suggests they're playing a relatively tight/passive style.\n\nWith my stack of 373 chips (46.6 BB) and the pot being only 20 chips, I should:\n1. Check behind and see a free turn card - I have some backdoor equity\n2. Consider a small bluff bet, but the paired board is dangerous for bluffing\n3. The opponent's passivity suggests they might have missed this flop too\n\nThe best play here is likely to check. I have position, a weak hand, and a passive opponent. I can:\n- Take a free card to try to improve\n- Pot control with my weak holding\n- Re-evaluate on the turn\n\nIf I bet, I risk getting called by any Jack, any 4, or any pocket pair. The board is scary enough that a bluff might not work, and I don't need to protect anything.\n\nChecking seems like the optimal play here.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 7h Th (7 of hearts, 10 of hearts)\n- Board: Jh Jc 4s 3s (Jack of hearts, Jack of clubs, 4 of spades, 3 of spades)\n- Pot: 20 chips\n- My stack: 373 chips (46.6 BB)\n- Position: BTN\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- The board has two Jacks, making it paired\n- I have a 7 and a 10, both hearts\n- There are 3 spades on the board (4s, 3s, plus the Jh is a heart not spade)\n- Wait, let me recount: Jh (hearts), Jc (clubs), 4s (spades), 3s (spades) - so 2 spades, not 3\n- No straight draws possible with my hand\n- No flush draw (I have hearts, board has spades)\n- My best hand is just high card 10 (since the board is paired Jacks)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's turn actions from the recall:\n- They frequently bet on the turn (hands 1, 2, 6, 10, 18)\n- They've also checked and folded (hands 8, 25, 46)\n- They seem to be an active player who bets frequently\n\n**Current Action:**\n- Preflop: I called 8 from BTN\n- Flop: Both checked\n- Turn: Opponent checked to me\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak - just high card 10 on a paired board\n2. **Position**: Good (on the button)\n3. **Pot size**: Small (20 chips)\n4. **Opponent's check**: Could be weakness or a trap\n5. **My stack**: Healthy at 46.6 BB\n6. **Board texture**: Paired board with potential straight draws (A-5, 5-6, etc.) and flush draw (spades)\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: Free card to see if I improve on river. Low risk.\n- **Bet**: Try to steal the pot. But what would I represent? A Jack? With my preflop call and flop check, betting now would look suspicious.\n- **Fold**: Too weak, and I have a free option to check.\n\n**Opponent's likely range**:\nSince they checked the turn after checking flop, they likely have:\n- Weak made hands (pocket pairs below J, Ace-high)\n- Draws (straight draws, flush draws)\n- Complete air\n\n**My decision**: This is a good spot to try a small bluff. The board is paired which reduces the number of strong hands opponent can have. They've shown weakness by checking twice. I can represent having a Jack or a strong hand that was slowplaying.\n\nHowever, looking at my actual hand, I have very little equity if called. And the pot is small - risking chips to win 20 might not be worth it.\n\nLet me reconsider: The opponent checked the turn. If I bet, I need to size it appropriately. Minimum raise is 8, which would be 8 to win 20 (2.5:1 pot odds for opponent). That's a decent bluff size.\n\nBut wait - I have position and a free card. The risk/reward of checking is better. If I check and the river is a heart, I might pick up a flush draw (though still weak). If the river pairs the board or brings a scare card, I might be able to bluff then.\n\nActually, given that I have no real equity and the opponent has been active, checking is the safer play. I can reevaluate on the river.",

The lack of aggression indicates they might be holding a marginal hand or completely missed the board. \n3. **Strategic Position**: From the button, I have positional advantage. This allows me to potentially steal the pot with a well-timed bluff.\n4. **Risk vs. Reward**: A small bet could potentially win the 20-chip pot, but it carries the risk of being called by a better hand.\n\nThe opponent's passive play and my positional advantage create an interesting bluffing opportunity. However, the board texture and my complete lack of hand strength make this a risky proposition. I'll need to carefully weigh the potential gain against the likelihood of being called.\n\nChecking seems the most prudent move, preserving my stack while avoiding unnecessary risk. The potential reward doesn't justify the gamble with such a weak hand.",

The weak hole cards, combined with being out of position, make this an easy decision to preserve chip stack and avoid unnecessary risk.",

Raising might isolate and get heads-up. Opponent's tendency: from recall, they have raised sometimes preflop (12, 12, 12, 24, 232). But this time they just called. Might be playing tight? Not sure. In tournament early-ish with 36 BB, we want to preserve stack. 5T is not a hand to risk a big raise. Checking is fine, we can see flop cheap. If we raise, min raise is 16 (total). That would be raise to 16 total, meaning we put 8 more (since we already have 8). That's a 2BB raise.

No pair, no straight draw (we have gutshot? board: J J 4 3, we have T,5. Straight possibilities: 6-7-8-9-10? Not. So we have just high card Ten, which is lower than Jacks. Opponent (seat1) Kimi-K2 Thinking has called preflop, checked flop, and now it's turn with amount to call 0 (they haven't bet). So we have option to check or raise. Pot is 20 chips. Stack 292. Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in. Since amount to call 0, raising to 8 means you bet 8). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since we are not facing a bet, folding would be weird (you can fold only if you want to give up hand). Check is safe. Raise could be a bluff or value. Our hand is weak; opponent likely has something better (maybe a jack, or a pair). Opponent's tendencies: from recall, they have raised preflop many times, also raised flop 24 chips (hand #9). That flop raise suggests they can be aggressive. But currently they checked flop. Could be they missed flop, or have a weak hand. Our hand is weak; we could try a small bluff to take pot. But risk: opponent may have Jacks or a set (maybe J J 4 gave them a pair of Jacks, they could have Jx). They might call or raise. With only 20 pot, raising to 8 is 40% pot. Could be okay as a bluff. However tournament considerations: we have 36.5 BB, not huge but decent. Preserving chips is important. A small bluff may be okay, but if opponent has a strong hand they could re-raise and we would be forced to fold and lose 8. That's okay. But maybe better to check and see river. River card unknown. Could be a straight or flush draw? Board: Jh Jc 4s 3s. No spade flush draw (two spades on board, we have no spade). So no flush draw. Straight draws: open-ended? 5-6-7-8-9? No. So not many draws.\n\nThus checking is safe. Considering opponent's previous pattern: they raised flop big when they had something. But they checked now, maybe they have medium hand like Jx or a pair of 4s, 3s. Could be they are checking to induce a bet. Our bet could be seen as a bluff; they may call with Jacks or a set, but they might also fold weaker. But we have no showdown value.\n\nGiven risk vs reward: pot 20, we can win 20 by betting 8 and being called maybe. If they fold, we win 20 for 8 risk. That's good EV if fold > 50% of time. Not sure.\n\nGiven limited info, I'd opt to check and see river. So action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We have a river situation: board J h J c 4 s 3 s 2 s. So board is paired Jacks, and three spades 4s 3s 2s - a possible straight flush draw but missed. Our hand: 5h Td. So we have Ten of diamonds, Five of hearts. No pair, no straight, no flush. Board has two Jacks, so opponent could have a Jack, making a set, or a full house (Jacks full of something). Also could have a straight? Board: J J 4 3 2. Straight possible with A K Q? No. With 5? 5-4-3-2-A? No Ace. So only possible hands: any pair of Jacks (set), any two pair (Jacks plus something else), maybe a straight using 5-4-3-2-A? Not possible. Flush? Board has three spades, need two spades in hand, we have none. So opponent could have a flush if they have two spades, but board spades are 4s,3s,2s; need at least two spades for flush, but there are only three spades on board, need two more for flush, but opponent only has two cards, could be both spades, giving a flush (5 spades). That would be a flush higher than any pair. Could also have a full house: Jacks full of something (if they have a Jack plus another card that pairs board? Actually board has J J, no other pair. To have full house, they'd need a pair on board plus a Jack, but board has no pair besides Jacks. So full house could be Jacks full of something if they have a Jack and a card that pairs with board? No board pair besides Jacks. So full house could be Jacks over something if they have a Jack and the board pairs something else? Not possible. So full house could be something like 4-4? Board has a single 4, not a pair. So full house not possible unless opponent has a pair in hand and board has a pair (Jacks). They could have a pocket pair, e.g., 5-5, making full house (Jacks full of 5s) if board has J J and they have a pair, that's three of a kind Jacks on board plus pair in hand => full house Jacks over X. Actually board has two Jacks, you need a third Jack to make three of a kind, then pair from hand gives full house. But opponent could have a Jack and a card matching board? If they have Jx, they'd have trips Jacks (three of a kind) not full house. Full house requires three of a kind + a pair. So they could have a pocket pair of something else, e.g., 4-4, making full house (4s over Jacks) but board only has one 4. So they'd need two 4s in hand plus two Jacks on board = full house 4s over Jacks? Actually board: J J 4 3 2. If opponent has 4-4, they'd have three 4s (two in hand + one on board) and a pair of Jacks on board -> full house 4s over Jacks. That's possible. Similarly 3-3 gives full house 3s over Jacks, etc. So many full house possibilities.\n\nOur hand is worthless. We have no showdown value. So we should fold. The amount to call is 0, but we can check. The legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since we have no chance to win, we should check (or fold). Checking is fine, we don't lose more chips. So action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

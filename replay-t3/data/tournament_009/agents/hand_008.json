            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm on the button with A8o. The blinds are 1/2, and my stack is 121 chips (60.5 BB). The small blind (MiniMax-M2) and big blind (GPT-OSS-120B) are yet to act after me.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has folded 7 out of 8 times preflop, only called once in hand #4. Very tight player.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has shown some aggression - raised in hand #6 preflop to 6, and bet on multiple streets. Has folded 3 times preflop.\n\nMy hand: A8o is a marginal hand. Ace-high with weak kicker. On the button, this is a reasonable steal candidate against tight blinds.\n\nPosition: Being on the button is a huge advantage - I get to act last postflop.\n\nStack sizes: I have 60.5 BB, which is healthy but not huge. SB has 96 BB, BB has 150 BB.\n\nTournament considerations: I haven't won a hand yet (0 wins, 6 folds, 1 loss). I need to accumulate chips. The blinds will come around again soon.\n\nGiven the tight tendencies of the SB (folds 87.5% of the time preflop) and the BB's mixed but not overly aggressive profile, raising from the button with A8o could be profitable. Even if called, I have position and an Ace which dominates some weaker Ax hands.\n\nHowever, A8o is not a great hand for calling. If I just call 2 chips, I'll be playing a multi-way pot out of position against the blinds, which is not ideal. Better to either raise or fold.\n\nPot odds: It's 2 chips to call into a 3 chip pot (1.5:1 odds), but position matters more.\n\nI think the best play is to raise to 6 chips total (4 more). This is a standard button raise that puts pressure on the blinds. If they fold, I win 3 chips. If called, I have position.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations... The minimum raise is to 4 total, but raising to 6 (3x BB) is standard.\n\nDecision: Raise to 6.",

BB checked to me.\n\nI should consider BB's tendencies. Let me search for GPT-OSS-120B's behavior. But first, I need to respond in JSON format. I'll make a decision based on basic poker strategy.\n\nSince I'm in position with ace high and some backdoor draws, checking back is reasonable to see a turn card and potentially bluff later if I improve. Raising could be a semi-bluff, but with ace high and only backdoor draws, not much fold equity. BB called preflop from BB, so they could have a wide range including many Qx, Jx, pocket pairs, suited connectors.\n\nChecking seems standard. I'll check. Let me provide reasoning.",

There's also a backdoor flush draw with diamonds on board, but I don't have a diamond. My hand has very little showdown value currently - just Ace-high.\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nGPT-OSS-120B seems to be an aggressive player. Looking at their actions:\n- Hand #2: Bet flop, bet turn, check river\n- Hand #6: Raised preflop, bet flop, bet turn, bet river (big bet of 45)\nThey appear to be continuation betting frequently and applying pressure.\n\n**Board analysis:**\nThe board is Q\u2666 J\u2666 3\u2665 9\u2660. This is a fairly wet board with straight and flush draws. My opponent checked the turn after checking the flop. Given their aggressive tendencies, this check might indicate weakness or a slow play.\n\n**Position:**\nI have position on the opponent (they act before me on each street).\n\n**Stack sizes:**\nI have 115 chips, opponent has 296. Pot is 13. A bet of 6-8 chips would be reasonable.\n\n**Decision considerations:**\n1. **Check:** Take a free card. My hand needs improvement. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to see a river card cheaply.\n2. **Bet:** Try to take down the pot now with a bluff. Given opponent's check on both flop and turn, they might be weak. A bet could win the pot immediately.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I'm at 57.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take excessive risks.\n\n**Pot odds:** If I bet, I need fold equity to justify it.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have position\n- Opponent checked twice (flop and turn)\n- Opponent is generally aggressive but showing weakness here\n- I have some draw equity (gutshot to straight)\n- My hand has minimal showdown value\n\nI think a small bet could be profitable. If I bet 6 chips (half pot), I need the opponent to fold about 30% of the time to be profitable. Given their check-check line, they might fold many hands that missed this board.\n\nHowever, checking is also reasonable to see a free river card. But if I check, I give up any chance to win the pot immediately, and I'll likely have to fold to any river bet if I don't improve.\n\nGiven my aggressive image from raising preflop, a continuation bet here could work well. I'll make a small bet to apply pressure."

It's suited connectors but very low, giving me very little straight or flush potential, and almost no pair potential except making the absolute lowest pairs.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the Small Blind (SB), which is a terrible position to play a weak hand from, as I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\n3. **The raise**: DeepSeek-V3.2 raised to 6 chips (3x the big blind). Looking at their history, they've been quite passive - mostly folding or calling, with one notable hand where they called all the way to showdown with pocket 6s against pocket Jacks.\n\n4. **Stack considerations**: I have 192 chips (96 BB), which is a healthy stack. The pot is 9 chips and I need to call 5 more to see the flop.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: If I call, I'd be putting 5 chips into a pot that would become 14 chips (9 + 5), giving me pot odds of about 2.8:1. However, with 2h 4d, I'm unlikely to win much even if I hit something, and I'm likely to be dominated if I do hit.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: This is a hand I should absolutely fold. 2h 4d is too weak to play from the SB, especially when facing a raise. Even though I have a good stack, there's no reason to waste chips on such a poor hand. I should wait for a better spot.\n\nThe correct decision is to fold this hand and wait for a better opportunity.",

Both checked. Turn is 9s. Pot is 13 chips. It's our turn? Actually actions list: flop check by us then opponent. Now turn: we have action? The description says \"TURN\". So we are to act now. Opponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) is remaining with 115 chips. No bets yet on turn, amount to call is 0. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 4.\n\nWe have pocket sevens, board QJ39. No pair, no straight draw? We have a gutshot? The board: Q J 3 9. Straight possibilities: 8-10? Actually we have 7s, we could have a straight draw if a 8 appears (8 would give 9-10-J-Q? Wait need 5 consecutive. Current board: Q J 3 9. No consecutive. If a 8 appears, we would have 7-8-9-10-J? But we lack 10. So no. If a 10 appears, we have 9-10-J-Q, missing J? Actually we have J on board, Q, so 10 would give us J-10-9? Not a straight. So no straight draws. Flush? Two diamonds on board, we have clubs and spades, no flush draw.\n\nThus our hand is just a middle pair (sevens) which is likely weak. Opponent's range: preflop raise to 6 from UTG? Actually seat 3 raised 6 from position? We don't know seat positions, but seat 3 is likely UTG or MP. He raised preflop, we called. So his range is fairly strong: broadway cards, pairs, suited connectors, etc. Flop QJ3 is favorable to many of those. He checked flop. Could be weak or drawing. Turn 9 is also a card that could give him straight draws (like 10-8). He may bet now. Should we check and see? Our stack is large relative to pot (296 chips, pot 13). We can check, but risk losing later. Better to check and evaluate river. If opponent bets, we can decide to call or fold. Our hand is likely not best. So checking is safe.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nWe need JSON: action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 6 into pot 19, after checking on flop. So they are betting on turn. What could they have? Could be a made hand like QJ (two pair), maybe a set? No set possible because board has no pair. Could be a straight draw: they have T9? Actually board has 9 now, so T9 would give pair of 9s? Actually they would have a pair of 9s if they hold 9x. But 9 on board, they could have 9x for trips? No board only one 9. So they'd have pair of 9s if they have another 9. Could be a combo draw like J10 (open-ended straight draw: J-10-9-8-7). Board: Q J 3 9. With J10 you have pair of J and open-ended? Actually J10 would give pair of J and also straight draw? Need 8? J10 gives J-J? Actually J is on board, you have pair of J.

K10 gives Q-J-10? Actually need 10-J-Q-K-A? Not. So many possibilities.\n\nOur hand: pocket 7s is weak. Likely we should fold. But consider stack sizes: we have 296 chips, opponent 109 chips.

They are in seat 3 (UTG? Actually seat 3 after seat 4 folded, seat 5 is BB). Preflop: seat 3 raised to 6 (so they are the raiser). So they are the aggressor preflop, and they checked flop, bet turn. Likely they have a hand like QJ (two pair), maybe a set? No set. Could be a pair of J, Q, or 9, or a straight draw, or a bluff. But with pocket 7s, we have low showdown value. Should we call? Pot odds: need 6 to win 25 (if call) => 6/25 = 24% equity needed. Our hand vs unknown? Probably less. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

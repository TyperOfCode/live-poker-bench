Seems to be playing somewhat straightforward.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Also relatively tight - folding frequently preflop, but has shown some post-flop aggression (hand 52: bet 40 on flop).\n\n**Pot**: 24 chips\n\n**Decision**: With 9-5 offsuit, this is a very weak hand. I have no need to invest more chips with this hand. I should check and see a free flop. There's no reason to raise here with this garbage hand. Even though I'm getting 3:1 odds (24 chips in pot, 0 to call), raising would be spewing chips with a hand that has very little equity.\n\nThe correct play is to check and see if I can hit a miracle flop, but otherwise fold to any significant aggression.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: 9d 5h (bottom pair on flop)\n- Stack: 453 chips (56.6 BB)\n- Board: 9h 3s 6h\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- Flop action: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) bet 8\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have bottom pair with 9d 5h. This is a marginal hand.\n- The board is 9h 3s 6h - there are potential flush draws and straight draws.\n- My 9 is vulnerable to overcards and better 9s.\n- The 5 kicker is very weak.\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 48: checked flop, turn, river (passive)\n- Hands 49-50: preflop folds\n- Hand 52: called preflop 4, then bet 40 on flop (big bet)\n- Hand 53: called preflop 8, then folded (showing some selectivity)\n- Hand 54: preflop fold\n\nThe opponent seems to bet big when they have something (40 chip bet in hand 52), but they also check a lot. Their current bet is only 8 into a 32 pot (1/4 pot), which is a weak/small bet.\n\n**My Recent Play:**\n- Hand 50: Won with 8s Th (was aggressive with raises and bets)\n- Hand 52: Folded BB with 9c 2s on 7c 7h Js board\n- Hand 54: Won with As 5s preflop raise\n\n**Position and Stack:**\n- I'm in BB position\n- I have a healthy stack of 56.6 BB\n- Pot is 32, bet to call is 8 (getting 4:1 odds)\n\n**Decision:**\nI have bottom pair with a weak kicker. The board has potential draws. The opponent's small bet suggests weakness or a draw. However, my hand is marginal and vulnerable.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold - too weak given the small bet and pot odds\n2. Call - getting 4:1 odds, but could be facing better hands/draws\n3. Raise - could take down the pot now, but would commit chips with a weak hand\n\nGiven the small bet size (8 into 32 pot), I think calling is reasonable. I'm getting good odds and the opponent's betting pattern suggests they could be weak. However, I need to be careful on later streets.\n\nLet me reconsider: I have bottom pair, weak kicker, on a draw-heavy board. The opponent bet 1/4 pot, which is often a weak bet or a probe bet. I could raise to take control, but that would commit chips with a marginal hand. A call seems best to see the turn and re-evaluate.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the opponent's pattern:\n- In hand 52, they called preflop small (4) then made a big bet (40) on the flop\n- Now they bet small (8) into a 32 pot\n\nThis inconsistent sizing suggests they might not have a strong hand. But with my weak kicker, I should be cautious.\n\nI'll call the 8 chip bet to see the turn. It's a small investment relative to the pot, and I have position on the opponent.",

The board has paired 3s, so I have two pair (9s and 3s), but my 5 doesn't play in the two pair. I'm currently beating any hand that doesn't have:\n- A higher pair (Ts, Js, Qs, Ks, As)\n- A 3 for trips (3x)\n- A made hand like 67, 68, 79, 89 for straights\n- Any flush draw that hit\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 80 to win 128, so pot odds are 128:80 or 1.6:1. This means I need ~38% equity to call.\n\n**Opponent analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the opponent actions I see that GPT-OSS-120B:\n- Has been relatively passive postflop\n- Often checks and folds\n- Made a large bet on the flop in hand 52 (40 chips)\n- In hand 53, called preflop then folded\n- Generally seems to bet when they have something\n\n**The betting pattern this hand:**\n- Preflop: Seat 4 called, Seat 5 (SB) called, I checked\n- Flop: Seat 5 bet 8 (small bet), I called, Seat 4 called\n- Turn: Seat 5 bets 80 (very large bet relative to pot)\n\nThe turn bet is a massive overbet (80 into a 128 pot). This suggests:\n1. A very strong hand (trip 3s, full house, maybe a flush that hit)\n2. A complete bluff trying to push us out\n3. Could have a 6 and be protecting against the flush draw\n\nGiven that Seat 5 called preflop from SB, they could have:\n- Any suited connector, any pair, any Ax, any broadway\n- On the flop they bet small (8 into 24 pot) - could be a probe bet or weak lead\n- On the turn they bomb it - this is suspicious\n\n**My hand strength:** I have two pair (9s and 3s). This is a decent hand but vulnerable to:\n- Any 3 (trip 3s)\n- Any higher pair\n- Any straight draw that hit\n- Any flush that hit (hearts)\n\n**My position:** I'm in the BB and already invested. I called the flop bet of 8.\n\n**Decision:** The large overbet on the turn is concerning. With my two pair, I'm probably ahead of many hands but I'm not strong enough to call such a large bet. The pot odds are not great (need ~38% equity), and I think I'm good less than that against this action.\n\nI should fold here.

Being on the button gives me positional advantage, and with 29+ BB stack depth, I have room for postflop play. The pot odds are favorable - calling 8 chips into a 12-chip pot gives me good value to see the flop.\n\nI'll call to see the flop and leverage my position.\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Calling with 89 suited on the button gives good pot odds (8 chips into 12) and leverages positional advantage.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n1. My hand: 8d 9c - This is a medium connector, not particularly strong but has some potential for straights and flushes\n2. Position: BTN (Button) - This is a good position as I'm last to act\n3. Stack: 233 chips (29.1 BB) - I'm at a comfortable stack depth\n4. Current situation: \n   - Blinds are 4/8, so it's a 1/2 BB blind level\n   - Pot is 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8)\n   - I need to call 8 chips to stay in the hand\n   - Minimum raise would be to 16 chips total\n\nLooking at the opponent information:\n\nKimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1):\n- Has been quite active preflop with a mix of actions\n- Recent hands show: fold, fold, check, call, call, raise to 16, fold, check, fold, raise to 24\n- Seems to be a relatively active player who will raise and call\n- Has 453 chips (56.6 BB) - decent stack\n\nGPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5):\n- Also active but more on the passive side\n- Recent hands: raise to 24, call 4, fold, check, fold, fold, call 4, call 8, fold, fold\n- Has 288 chips (36 BB) - also a decent stack\n\nMy considerations:\n1. Hand strength: 89 suited is playable but not premium\n2. Position: Button is excellent\n3. Stack depth: 29+ BB allows for postflop play\n4. Opponent tendencies: Both opponents seem capable of playing hands\n\nGiven that:\n- I have position\n- My hand has decent potential (straight and flush possibilities)\n- The opponents seem to be playing a range of hands\n- The call is only 8 chips into a 12-chip pot (good pot odds)\n\n\nI'll call to see the flop, leveraging my positional advantage and the hand's potential. The call offers good value with 29+ BB in my stack, allowing flexibility in postflop play.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 8d 9c (middle suited connectors)\n2. **Position**: BTN (Button) - good position\n3. **Stack**: 225 chips (28.1 BB) - decent stack size\n4. **Board**: 9h 3s 6h\n5. **Pot**: 40 chips\n6. **Actions**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) bet 8, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called 8\n7. **Amount to call**: 8 chips\n8. **Minimum raise to**: 16 chips\n\nLet me think about my hand strength:\n- I have 8d 9c, which gives me a pair of 9s on the board\n- The board is 9h 3s 6h - fairly disconnected with a potential flush draw\n- I have middle pair, which is decent but not premium\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): From the data, I can see this player bets on flop frequently (10 actions found, 3 were bets). They've shown some decent hands at showdown like Jc/Ad, Td/Jc, 5h/Td. They seem to be an active player who bets with various hands.\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): This player seems more passive, checking most of the time (5 actions, 4 were checks, only 1 bet). They've shown strong hands like pocket 5s, KK, and 6s/3c.\n\nGiven the betting action:\n- Seat 5 bet 8 into 32 chip pot (this is about 25% pot bet)\n- Seat 1 called (could be drawing, weak pair, or medium strength)\n\nMy options:\n1. **Fold**: I have middle pair, which has some showdown value\n2. **Call 8**: This gives me pot odds of 5:1 (40+8+8 = 56 to win for 8 to call), which is decent\n\n\n3. **Raise to 16**: This would be a small raise, potentially taking down the pot or getting called by worse hands\n\nI'll carefully evaluate the raise option. With a 16-chip raise, I'm risking 16 chips to potentially win 56, giving me 3.5:1 pot odds. The middle pair of 9s provides some protection, and my position on the button gives me additional leverage. The board's disconnected nature means opponents might have difficulty improving their hands significantly. A small raise could effectively pressure weaker hands while potentially isolating against more marginal holdings.\n\nThe key considerations are the betting patterns of my opponents and the board's texture. Their passive tendencies and the lack of connected cards suggest a raise might be strategically sound. I'll lean towards a calculated raise that maximizes my positional advantage and exploits their predictable play style.",

However, this is a very weak pair with poor kickers. The board is also paired (3s), making it more dangerous, and I have no strong draws.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the history, GPT-OSS-120B has been active on the turn, betting in most hands where they had the opportunity with varying bet sizes. Their bet of 80 chips into a 128-chip pot (about 62.5% pot) is a significant sizing that typically indicates strength.\n\n**Stack and Tournament Considerations:**\nWith 217 chips (27.1 BB), I'm in a reasonable stack position but not deep enough to make loose calls. The bet represents about 37% of my stack, so calling would leave me with 137 chips. If I raise to the minimum 160, I'd be committing most of my stack with a weak hand.\n\n**Decision:**\nWhile I'm getting decent pot odds (2.6:1), my hand is too weak to continue against a large bet. The paired board and my poor kickers make this a clear fold. In tournament play, preserving my 27+ BB stack for a better spot is the right strategy rather than getting into marginal situations.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have a weak pair (9s) with poor kickers on a paired board, facing a large bet from an aggressive opponent. The hand strength is insufficient to continue, and preserving my 27+ BB stack for a better spot is the optimal tournament strategy.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this turn situation carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in the BTN (Button) position with 8d 9c\n- Stack: 217 chips (27.1 BB)\n- Pot: 128 chips\n- Board: 9h 3s 6h 3d\n- Facing a bet of 80 chips from GPT-OSS-120B\n- Minimum raise would be to 160 chips\n- Seat 1 just folded\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have 8d 9c, and the board shows 9h 3s 6h 3d. This gives me:\n- One pair (9s) - I have 9c and board shows 9h\n- But this is a weak pair with poor kickers\n- The board has paired 3s, making it more dangerous\n- I have straight possibilities but 8-9 is not a strong drawing hand here\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's turn actions, I see they bet on most turns when they had the opportunity, with varying bet sizes (6, 8, 20 chips). They also folded and checked sometimes. The fact that they're betting 80 chips into a 128-chip pot is a significant bet (about 62.5% pot), suggesting strength.\n\n**Position Considerations:**\n- I'm in the BTN, which is a good position\n- However, I'm heads-up against an opponent who has shown aggression\n- My stack is 217 chips, so calling 80 would leave me with 137 chips\n- If I raise to 160, I'd be committing a large portion of my stack\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Hand strength: I have a weak pair (9s) with poor kickers\n2. Board texture: Paired board is dangerous\n3. Opponent's bet size: Large bet suggests strength\n4. Stack considerations: I'm not short-stacked, but 217 chips isn't huge either\n5. Pot odds: I'd be getting about 2.6:1 on a call (208 total pot if I call vs 80 to call)\n\n\nThe mathematical analysis reveals a clear path forward. With 2.6:1 pot odds, I'm getting decent value to continue, but the weak pair and dangerous board demand caution. The large bet size from my opponent signals significant strength, making a raise potentially costly. Given the board's paired nature and my marginal hand, the prudent choice is to fold and preserve my chip stack for a more favorable situation.\n\nMy tournament strategy prioritizes chip preservation, especially with 27.1 big blinds remaining. The weak kicker and potential risks outweigh any potential marginal gain from calling.\n",

No, seat4 just called, so amount to call is 4 (the BB's 8 is already in pot, SB posted 4, seat4 called 8, so we need to call 4 to match BB? Actually SB posted 4, BB posted 8, seat4 called 8, so SB is already 4 in, need to call additional 4 to match 8.

Opponents: seat1 Kimi-K2 is big stack 453, seat4 MiniMax-M2 225. We have no info about their tendencies. Might be okay to call and see flop cheap.\n\nBut we have position disadvantage (out of position post-flop). Qh7h suited has some flush potential, but not strong. In SB, typical strategy is either raise with strong hands or fold weaker. Q7 suited is borderline. Might just call.\n\nCheck legal actions: fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise total to 16). Raising would be to 16 total (i.e., raise 8 more). That would be 8 raise over call? Actually we have to put total 16 chips (including our 4 already posted). So raise amount = 12 more? Wait we have posted 4, call amount 4 to reach 8, raising to 16 means we need to add 12 more chips (4 already + 4 call + 12 raise = 20 total?). Actually typical: amount to call = 4, minimum raise to = 16 (total). So raise would be adding 12 more chips (so total contribution becomes 16). That would be a decent raise size (2.5x BB). Might isolate.\n\nGiven we have 36 BB, we could raise to try to steal blinds. Qh7h is not premium but could be okay for a steal. However we have a caller already (seat4) who called BB, so raising may get re-raised.

So we have a gutshot straight draw plus flush draw. Also we have a pair? No. So decent draw.\n\nPot is 24 chips. Stack 284. Opponent MiniMax-M2 has 225 chips. Preflop actions: seat4 called 8 (so in the pot). So flop action: after preflop, seat5 (us) is SB, seat1 (Kimi) is BB? Actually seat1 is BB, seat5 is SB. The flop action order: Usually after flop, first to act is UTG etc but with only two players left: seat4 (MiniMax) is in the big blind? Actually seat4 is MP maybe? Wait seat4 is MiniMax-M2, seat5 is us, seat1 is BB. The flop order: The player left of the dealer (SB) acts first? In Texas Hold'em, flop action starts with the first active player left of the dealer button. The button is seat5? Actually we are SB seat5, button is seat? Not given. But preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, seat4 called 8 (so they are under the gun? Actually seat4 is MP maybe). Then seat5 call 4 (SB). Then seat1 (BB) check. So after preflop, seat4 (MiniMax) is the only other player besides us and BB. The BB checked, so flop action: first to act is seat4 (MiniMax) because they are left of button? Actually after preflop, the first to act on flop is the player left of the button (i.e., SB). But the SB (us) is seat5, but we are after seat4? Hmm typical: Button is seat5? No, SB is seat5, BB is seat1, seat4 is UTG? The button is seat? Not given. In a 5-player game, button rotates; currently seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB, so button is seat4? Possibly. So flop action order: first to act is seat5 (SB) because it's left of button? Actually the button is seat4, so first to act is seat5 (SB). So we have the option to act now. The legal actions: fold, check, raise. So opponent hasn't acted yet on flop. So we can check or raise.\n\nOur hand: strong draw, pot 24, opponent stack 225, we have 284. We could bet to build pot and possibly take down now, but also risk being raised. Considering opponent tendencies: recall shows MiniMax-M2 has flopped bets of 4,4,6,4,20,8. So they sometimes bet small, sometimes big (20). They may be aggressive. In this hand, they haven't acted yet; we can check and see what they do. With a draw, checking can induce a bet from them, giving us odds. However, we have position? Actually we are first to act, so checking gives them opportunity to bet. If they bet, we can call (or raise). Since we have a decent draw, calling a moderate bet is okay.\n\nPot 24, we have 284, we can afford a raise. Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total? Actually raise_to is total amount, minimum raise is 8 which would be raise to 8? Since amount to call is 0, raising to 8 would be a bet of 8). That's a small bet relative to pot (8 into 24). Might be okay to put pressure. If they have a hand they might call or raise. Could also raise bigger to protect.\n\nGiven opponent's range includes draws and made hands. A bet of 8 could be good to get value from top pair or to charge draws. But we also risk being raised by a stronger hand, but we can fold then.\n\nI think best is to bet (raise) to 8 (i.e., bet 8). Reason: we have strong draws, want to build pot, and we can get value if they have a pair. Also we can protect against free cards.\n\nThus action: raise to 8.\n\n"

No.\n\nWe are in SB, after flop we bet 8, opponent (Seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking) called 8, and MiniMax-M2 (Seat4) called 8 as well. So pot now 48 chips (including blinds and bets). Turn: we have amount to call 0 (so it's our action). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 8. So we can check or raise. Our stack 276 chips, we have 34.5 BB, pot 48 chips. Our hand Qh7h has a flush draw (2 hearts on board, we have two hearts, need one more). There are two hearts left in deck? Actually hearts remaining: we have Qh,7h, board has 9h,6h. So hearts left: Ah, Kh, Jh, Th, 8h,5h,4h,2h = 8 hearts. Turn card unknown (already dealt? Actually board shows turn? Board is 9h 3s 6h 3d - that's four cards, so turn is 3d. So turn just happened, we are acting after turn. So we have seen the turn card: 3d (a diamond). That does not affect flush. So we have 2 hearts on board, we have two hearts, still need one more heart on river. There are 8 hearts left out of remaining unseen cards: deck size initially 52, known cards: our 2, opponent 0 known, board 4 = 6 known, plus blinds? irrelevant. So 46 unknown cards, 8 hearts => probability ~ 8/46 = 17.4% to hit flush on river. Also we have backdoor straight possibilities? Not relevant.\n\nWe have pot 48, we could bet to protect against draws? Opponents: Kimi-K2 (Seat1) stack 445, unknown style. MiniMax-M2 stack 217, we have recall: they have raised preflop sometimes and flop raises sometimes, sometimes big raise (40) on flop. So they can be aggressive. On turn we have a drawing hand, want to either semi-bluff or check. Since we have only 48 pot, raising to maybe 48 or 56? Minimum raise 8, but we could raise larger to apply pressure. Our stack 276, not short. Considering tournament stage, we have 34 BB, decent. Opponents have bigger stacks (445 and 217). They could call or raise. A raise may fold out weaker hands like middle pair, but they may have made a hand (maybe 9x, 3x). They have called flop bet 8, so they might have some pair or draw. Could be 9x, 6x, 3x, flush draw, etc.\n\nOur hand is not strong now, only a draw. A check might give free river, but we may lose if opponent bets and we have to call. A raise could be a semi-bluff: we could raise to about 80 (pot+?) to apply pressure. But we need to consider implied odds: If we hit flush, we could win big. Opponents' stacks: 217 and 445, pot 48. If we raise to 80, they'd need to call 80 to win 128 pot (plus future river bet). Might be okay.\n\nBut also we could consider check-raise later? Not possible now.\n\nGiven we have a draw, I think a raise is appropriate to protect against opponent's pair and also build pot for when we hit flush. So raise to maybe 80 (approx 1.5x pot). Minimum raise is 8, but we can raise more. Since legal actions include raise, we must specify raise_to total amount. Let's choose raise_to 80.\n\nReasoning: semi-bluff, decent equity, protect against draws, opponent likely to fold weaker hands.\n\nThus output."

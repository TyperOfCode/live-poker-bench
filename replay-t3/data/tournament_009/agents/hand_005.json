Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has raised preflop twice (hands 1 and 2, to 6 and 8 respectively). This player seems aggressive.\n3. I have 94.5 BB stack, which is healthy.\n\nThere are still 4 players to act after me (MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB). With a weak hand like K3o from UTG, the standard play is to fold. The King is not strong enough to open with from early position, especially with a weak kicker.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've folded all 4 hands so far. While I might want to play more hands, this is not the spot. K3o is a hand that can easily be dominated by better kings (AK, KQ, KJ, KT) and will often be behind when I hit top pair with weak kicker.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips (including the blinds). That's 2 to win 5 (if I call), which is 2.5:1 odds, or 40% equity needed. K3o doesn't have that much equity against multiple opponents.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (94.5 BB), so preserving chips is important. There's no reason to risk chips with a marginal hand from the worst position.\n\nDecision: Fold. This is a clear fold in UTG with K3o."

UTG is the worst position to play from, especially with a weak hand. Looking at the opponent tendencies:\n\n1. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop once before (hand 4, raised to 4). \n2. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has raised preflop twice (hands 1 and 2, to 6 and 8 respectively). This player seems aggressive.\n3. I have 94.5 BB stack, which is healthy.\n\nThere are still 4 players to act after me (MP, CO, BTN, SB, BB). With a weak hand like K3o from UTG, the standard play is to fold. The King is not strong enough to open with from early position, especially with a weak kicker.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've folded all 4 hands so far. While I might want to play more hands, this is not the spot. K3o is a hand that can easily be dominated by better kings (AK, KQ, KJ, KT) and will often be behind when I hit top pair with weak kicker.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips (including the blinds). That's 2 to win 5 (if I call), which is 2.5:1 odds, or 40% equity needed. K3o doesn't have that much equity against multiple opponents.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (94.5 BB), so preserving chips is important. There's no reason to risk chips with a marginal hand from the worst position.\n\nDecision: Fold. This is a clear fold in UTG with K3o.",

The blinds are 1/2.\n\nI think calling is reasonable. A4s in position against a cutoff raise is playable. Pot odds are good. I'll call.\n\nSo my response should be:\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A4s in position with good pot odds (3.25:1). Calling to see flop with position advantage against cutoff raise.\"\n}\n\nWait, but actually I'm in the BB, not button. Let me re-read: \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\". It says BTN. But the actions show: Seat 2 post_sb 1, Seat 3 post_bb 2. That means I'm actually the big blind, not button. The button is seat 3? Actually BTN means button. So I'm the button, but I posted BB? That seems inconsistent. Let me check: \"Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 198 chips\" and \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\". So I'm seat 3, which is button. But the actions show \"Seat 3 post_bb 2\". That means button posted big blind? That's unusual. Maybe it's a tournament with antes or something? Actually blinds are 1/2. SB is seat 2, BB is seat 3. So button is in BB position this hand. That means I'm out of position postflop. That changes things.\n\nIf I'm in the BB, I'm out of position. That makes A4s weaker. But I'm getting a good price: need to call 4 into pot of 9. That's still 2.25:1 pot odds (9:4). Actually pot is 9 (SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 6). I need to call 4 more. So total pot after my call would be 13. My pot odds are 4 to win 9+4=13, so 13:4 = 3.25:1, which is 23.5% equity needed.\n\nA4s against a typical cutoff raising range has about 30% equity. So pot odds are okay. But being out of position reduces implied odds. However, we're both deep (99 BB effective).\n\nI think calling is still okay given the price. Folding might be too tight. Raising could be an option as a 3-bet bluff, but with A4s I'd rather not 3-bet out of position.\n\nI'll stick with call.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with A4 offsuit. The flop is Td 5d 7h rainbow except for two diamonds. I have a backdoor flush draw with the A\u2666, but otherwise my hand is weak - just Ace high with no pair. The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) raised preflop from the cutoff to 6 chips (3x BB), and I called from the big blind.\n\nNow the flop comes, and it's my action first since the preflop raiser is in position. The pot is 13 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise + 4 call = 13). I have 194 chips left.\n\nI need to decide what to do. My hand is weak - Ace high with a backdoor flush draw and backdoor straight possibilities (though unlikely with A4). The board is fairly dry with T-5-7 rainbow. The preflop raiser could have a wide range here since it's just heads-up.\n\nGiven that I'm out of position and have a weak hand, I should consider checking and seeing what the opponent does. If I check and he bets, I'll have to decide whether to continue. With Ace high and a backdoor flush draw, I might have some equity, but not much.\n\nPot odds: If I check and he bets, say half pot (6-7 chips), I'd be getting about 3:1 odds. My equity against a range of pairs, Broadway cards, etc. is probably around 25-30% at best. But with just Ace high, I'd likely need to improve to win.\n\nAlternative: I could lead out with a small bet to try to take the pot down now. A bet of 4-5 chips (30-40% pot) might get folds from hands like KQ, QJ, or smaller pocket pairs. But if he raises, I'm in a tough spot.\n\nGiven that I have no information on this opponent (no history found), and this appears to be early in the tournament, I should play somewhat cautiously. Checking seems reasonable to see what the opponent does.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 97 BB, so I'm deep. No need to take big risks with marginal hands. But also, being on the button gives me some positional advantage in future streets, though I'm actually out of position in this hand since I called from BB.\n\nActually wait - I'm on the button, but I was the big blind. So I'm actually out of position for this hand. The opponent is in position.\n\nGiven all this, I think checking is the best play. If the opponent checks behind, I get a free card to potentially improve. If he bets, I can evaluate based on bet size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Weak hand with only Ace high and backdoor flush draw.

Actually, with A4 on T-5-7 board, I have a gutshot to a 6 (making 4-5-6-7 straight). Weak hand overall.\n\n2. **Board texture:** T\u2666 5\u2666 7\u2665 - fairly dry board except for diamond flush draw. My A\u2660 is not a diamond, so I only have one diamond (4\u2666). The board doesn't connect well with typical raising ranges.\n\n3. **Opponent's range:** Seat 5 raised from late position (CO or BTN? Actually Seat 5 is after folded seats, so likely late position). Range could be wide. The small 4-chip bet on flop (23.5% pot) could be a continuation bet with a wide range, trying to take it down with any two cards.\n\n4. **Pot odds:** Pot is 17 + 4 = 21 chips. Need to call 4 chips. That's 4:21 or about 1:5.25 pot odds (19% equity needed). \n\n5. **My equity:** Against a reasonable range (pairs, broadways, suited connectors), I estimate I have around 25-30% equity with my A-high + backdoor draws. The gutshot gives me 4 outs (6s), and the backdoor flush draw adds some equity. Aces might be good sometimes if opponent has complete air.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** I have 97 BB stack, healthy. Folding loses nothing. Calling keeps me in the hand with position (I act last on future streets).\n\n7. **Position advantage:** I'm on the BTN, which is great position. I get to see opponent's turn action before I act.\n\n8. **Bet sizing tells:** The small bet (4 into 17) looks like a probe or weak continuation bet. Could be trying to get a cheap look at turn or thin value with medium strength.\n\nGiven the pot odds (19% needed), my estimated equity (25-30%), position advantage, and the small bet size suggesting weakness, I should call. Raising might be an option to take it down now, but with my weak hand and backdoor draws, I prefer to call and reassess on turn.\n\nHowever, let me think about the gutshot more carefully: I need a 6. There are 4 sixes in the deck. That's about 8% equity just from the straight. Backdoor flush draw adds maybe 4% more. Ace might be good sometimes. So maybe 15-20% equity total. Still, with 19% needed, it's close.\n\nActually, the pot odds calculation: 4 to win 25 (21 current + my 4 call) = 16% equity needed. Wait, recalc: Pot before bet: 17. Opponent bets 4, making pot 21.

The situation is a poker hand where I'm on the BTN with A4o on a Td 5d 7h board. I checked, opponent bet 4 into 17. I need to decide: fold, call, or raise.\n\nI analyzed earlier and concluded calling is marginal but okay due to pot odds (16% equity needed), position, and backdoor draws. Let me confirm the numbers.\n\nPot is 17, opponent bet 4 making pot 21. I need to call 4 to win 25 total (21+4). That's 4/25 = 16% equity needed.\n\nMy hand: A4o, board Td 5d 7h. I have A-high, backdoor flush draw with 4d, gutshot straight draw (need a 6). That's 4 outs to a straight = ~8% equity. Backdoor flush draw adds maybe 4%. Ace might be good sometimes.

I have Ace high with backdoor flush potential (4d gives me a diamond, but board has two diamonds already). Actually, I have 4d, board has Td and 7h, Js, 5d. So there are two diamonds on board (Td, 5d). I have 4d, so I have a flush draw with one more diamond. That's actually a flush draw! Wait, I have 4d, board has Td and 5d. That's three diamonds total. I need two more diamonds for a flush. Actually, a flush requires 5 cards of same suit. I have one diamond, board has two diamonds, so I need two more diamonds on turn and river. That's not a flush draw yet - I need runner-runner diamonds.\n\nBut I also have a gutshot straight draw: board is T-5-7-J. I need a 9 for a straight (8-9-T-J-Q? Wait, let's check: board T-5-7-J. For a straight, I could have 8-9 for a straight? Actually, with A4, possible straights: if a 3 comes, I have A-4-5-? Actually 3 would give me A-2-3-4-5? No, I have A4. Board T-5-7-J. Not many straight possibilities. Maybe if a 6 comes, I'd have 4-5-6-7? That's only 4 cards. Not a straight.\n\nMy hand is weak: Ace high with weak kicker. I have position (BTN) and opponent is in Seat 5 (must be CO or BTN? Actually seats: 1 folded, 2 folded (SB), 3 is me (BB), 4 folded, 5 raised preflop. So opponent is in early position? Actually seat 5 is after me? Wait, seating: 1, 2, 3 (me), 4, 5. So opponent in seat 5 acted after me preflop. That means they raised from late position, maybe CO or BTN? Actually I was BB, so seat 5 is either BTN or CO depending on table size. Anyway, they raised preflop, I called from BB with A4o.\n\nFlop: Td 5d 7h. I checked, they bet 4 into pot of ~13? Let's calculate: preflop pot: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6, I called 4 more. So pot preflop: 1+2+6+4=13? Actually SB folded, so only 1 from SB, 2 from BB, 6 from raiser, 4 from my call = 13. Flop: they bet 4, I called 4, pot now 21.\n\nTurn: Js. No flush yet. I have nothing but Ace high. I'm getting 21:0 odds to check (no bet). I could check and see what opponent does. They might bet again with a wide range since they raised preflop and bet flop. They could have a pair, a draw, or air.\n\nMy stack: 190 chips (95 BB). Opponent has 190 chips. Pot is 21. Not huge.\n\nGiven my weak hand and only Ace high, I should probably check and fold to a bet unless I get good odds. But I have position - I can check and see what they do. If they check behind, I get a free river. If they bet, I need to evaluate.\n\nActually, I have the option to bet as a bluff. But with Ace high on a board with T-5-7-J, there are many draws (flush draw, straight draws). My hand has some showdown value if checked through, but not much.\n\nBetter to check and see what opponent does. If they bet small, maybe I call if I think they're bluffing and I have some equity with Ace high. But realistically, I'm probably behind.\n\nLet me think about opponent's range: They raised preflop from late position, could be wide. They bet flop on Td 5d 7h, could be continuation bet. Turn Js might hit some of their range (JJ, AJ, KJ, QJ, JT). Also flush draws.\n\nMy hand blocks some Ax hands that might bluff.\n\nGiven I have no history on opponent, and it's early in tournament, I should play cautiously. Check and evaluate.\n\nDecision: check."

Amount to call is 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. They need to output a JSON object with action, raise_to, reasoning.\n\nI need to think about the hand. I have A4o, Ace high with weak kicker. Board has two diamonds, I have 4d giving me a backdoor flush draw (need two more diamonds). Also board T-5-7-J, not much straight potential for my hand. I have position, opponent raised preflop from seat 5 (late position) and bet flop. Turn brought Js, no flush. Pot is 21, no bet to call. I can check, raise, or fold. Folding seems too weak when I can check for free. Raising could be a bluff, but with Ace high and no strong draw, probably not good. Checking seems standard to see what opponent does on river, maybe bluff catch if they check behind or bet small.\n\nBut wait, I have position, I'm last to act. Actually, on turn, opponent acted first? Let's see: preflop: seat 5 raised, I called. Flop: I checked, seat 5 bet, I called. Turn: board shown, now it's my action? Actually, the hand description says \"=== Hand #1 - TURN ===\" and shows board, then \"Amount to call: 0\". That suggests it's my turn to act, and opponent has not acted yet? But in Texas Hold'em, after flop, the action continues with the first player still in hand left of the dealer. I'm BTN (seat 3), opponent is seat 5. Typically, the order would be: after flop, first to act is the player left of the dealer. I'm BTN, so opponent in seat 5 might be first to act? Actually, need to consider positions. Seats: 1, 2, 3 (me BTN), 4, 5. Blinds: seat 2 posted SB, seat 3 (me) posted BB. Preflop: seat 4 folded, seat 5 raised, seat 1 folded, seat 2 folded, I called. So there are two players: me (BB) and seat 5 (raiser). On flop, first to act is the player left of the dealer? Actually, the dealer button is at seat 3 (me). So the small blind (seat 2) would act first, but they folded. So the first to act postflop is the next player after the dealer, which is seat 4, but they folded. Then seat 5, then me. So seat 5 acts first postflop. On flop, I checked, seat 5 bet, I called. On turn, the action should start with seat 5 again. But the interface says \"Amount to call: 0\" and legal actions for me. That suggests it's my turn to act, meaning seat 5 has already acted and checked? Or maybe the interface is showing that it's my turn because I'm the user? Wait, the description might be that the turn card is dealt, and now it's my action because I'm the user and the opponent has not acted yet? Actually, typical poker interface: after turn card, the first player to act is the one left of the dealer. That would be seat 5. But maybe the system is waiting for my action because I'm the user and the opponent's action is simulated after mine? Or maybe the opponent has already checked? The \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests there is no bet to call, meaning opponent has checked. Because if opponent had bet, amount to call would be >0. So opponent must have checked. That makes sense: on turn, opponent checked, and now it's my action with option to check, raise, or fold.\n\nThus, opponent checked the turn. That's interesting. They raised preflop, bet flop, then checked turn. Could be weakness, could be trapping. But with board Td 5d 7h Js, the Js might have missed them. They might have a hand like TT, JJ, AJ, etc. But they checked. I have Ace high. I could try to bluff, representing a J or a strong hand. But with only 21 pot, and my stack 190, a bluff might work if opponent is weak. However, they might call with any pair. I have some equity if I get called: I have 6 outs to pair my Ace (3 Aces left), maybe 3 outs to pair my 4 (but that's weak). Also backdoor"

          "reasoning_content": "The user is playing poker and needs to make a decision. They are on the turn with A4 offsuit, board Td 5d 7h Js. Their position is BTN, stack 190 chips. Pot is 21 chips. Amount to call is 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. They need to output a JSON object with action, raise_to, reasoning.\n\nI need to think about the hand. I have A4o, Ace high with weak kicker. Board has two diamonds, I have 4d giving me a backdoor flush draw (need two more diamonds). Also board T-5-7-J, not much straight potential for my hand. I have position, opponent raised preflop from seat 5 (late position) and bet flop. Turn brought Js, no flush. Pot is 21, no bet to call. I can check, raise, or fold. Folding seems too weak when I can check for free. Raising could be a bluff, but with Ace high and no strong draw, probably not good. Checking seems standard to see what opponent does on river, maybe bluff catch if they check behind or bet small.\n\nBut wait, I have position, I'm last to act. Actually, on turn, opponent acted first? Let's see: preflop: seat 5 raised, I called. Flop: I checked, seat 5 bet, I called. Turn: board shown, now it's my action? Actually, the hand description says \"=== Hand #1 - TURN ===\" and shows board, then \"Amount to call: 0\". That suggests it's my turn to act, and opponent has not acted yet? But in Texas Hold'em, after flop, the action continues with the first player still in hand left of the dealer. I'm BTN (seat 3), opponent is seat 5. Typically, the order would be: after flop, first to act is the player left of the dealer. I'm BTN, so opponent in seat 5 might be first to act? Actually, need to consider positions. Seats: 1, 2, 3 (me BTN), 4, 5. Blinds: seat 2 posted SB, seat 3 (me) posted BB. Preflop: seat 4 folded, seat 5 raised, seat 1 folded, seat 2 folded, I called. So there are two players: me (BB) and seat 5 (raiser). On flop, first to act is the player left of the dealer? Actually, the dealer button is at seat 3 (me). So the small blind (seat 2) would act first, but they folded. So the first to act postflop is the next player after the dealer, which is seat 4, but they folded. Then seat 5, then me. So seat 5 acts first postflop. On flop, I checked, seat 5 bet, I called. On turn, the action should start with seat 5 again. But the interface says \"Amount to call: 0\" and legal actions for me. That suggests it's my turn to act, meaning seat 5 has already acted and checked? Or maybe the interface is showing that it's my turn because I'm the user? Wait, the description might be that the turn card is dealt, and now it's my action because I'm the user and the opponent has not acted yet? Actually, typical poker interface: after turn card, the first player to act is the one left of the dealer. That would be seat 5. But maybe the system is waiting for my action because I'm the user and the opponent's action is simulated after mine? Or maybe the opponent has already checked? The \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests there is no bet to call, meaning opponent has checked. Because if opponent had bet, amount to call would be >0. So opponent must have checked. That makes sense: on turn, opponent checked, and now it's my action with option to check, raise, or fold.\n\nThus, opponent checked the turn. That's interesting. They raised preflop, bet flop, then checked turn. Could be weakness, could be trapping. But with board Td 5d 7h Js, the Js might have missed them. They might have a hand like TT, JJ, AJ, etc. But they checked. I have Ace high. I could try to bluff, representing a J or a strong hand. But with only 21 pot, and my stack 190, a bluff might work if opponent is weak. However, they might call with any pair. I have some equity if I get called: I have 6 outs to pair my Ace (3 Aces left), maybe 3 outs to pair my 4 (but that's weak). Also backdoor",

          "reasoning_content": "No history available. This might be early in tournament. Let's analyze based on hand.\n\nMy hand: A4 offsuit. Board Td 5d 7h Js. I have Ace-high, backdoor flush draw (3 diamonds, need runner-runner), no straight draw. Very weak hand.\n\nOpponent's actions: Raised preflop from late position (likely CO or UTG depending on seating). Bet small on flop (4 into 13, ~30% pot). Bet small on turn (8 into 21, ~38% pot). This could be betting for value with medium strength (pair of Jacks, Tens, maybe overpair like QQ-AA, though would likely bet bigger). Could be bluff with missed overcards.\n\nPot odds: Need 8 to call, pot will be 37 after my call? Actually pot is 29 now (21+8), I call 8 makes pot 37. My investment 8 to win 29, so need ~21.6% equity.\n\nWhat equity does A4o have against reasonable range? Let's estimate: Against top 20% hands (77+, A9s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KQo), A4o has about 18% equity on this board. Against tighter range (top 10%: 77+, ATs+, KQs, AJo+), maybe 15%. Against bluff range (any two cards), maybe 30-40%. But opponent likely has something given betting on two streets.\n\nThe small bet sizes suggest opponent doesn't have monster (would bet bigger for value). Could be betting for protection with medium pair (like JJ, TT, 99, 88, maybe 77). Board has Td 5d 7h Js. Possible sets: TT, 55, 77, JJ. But would likely bet bigger. Could have two pair: JT, T7, J5, etc.\n\nMy Ace-high is likely not good. I have 3 outs to pair Ace (3 Aces left), but need to discount because opponent might have AJ, AT, etc. So maybe 1.5 outs. Backdoor flush needs runner-runner diamonds: probability ~4.5%. So total equity maybe ~10%.\n\nPot odds require 21.6%. So fold unless I think opponent bluffing frequently.\n\nBut I have position (button). Calling allows me to see river and potentially bluff if diamond comes or Ace comes. However, my stack is 190, opponent 182. Pot is small relative to stacks.\n\nTournament considerations: early stage, preserve stack. This is a marginal spot. I think folding is correct. The small bet sizing could be inducing calls, but I have very little equity.\n\nLet's consider if I raise as bluff. Could represent strong hand like flush draw, straight draw, two pair. But opponent has shown strength by betting two streets. Raising would be risky with Ace-high. Minimum raise to 16 (total). That's 16 to call for opponent into pot of 29+16=45? Actually if I raise to 16 total (I put 16, opponent put 8 already, so additional 8 for me). Pot would be 29+8=37, opponent needs to call 8 more. So pot odds for opponent 8:37 \u2248 4.6:1. They'll call with any decent hand. Bluff likely fails.\n\nBetter to fold. I'll fold.\n\nResponse JSON: {\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A4o with Ace-high on Td 5d 7h Js board has minimal equity (~10%).

Likely playing tight.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has raised preflop in both previous hands (to 6 and 8 chips). Shows aggressive tendencies. Also continued betting on flop and turn in both hands.\n\n**Position Advantage:**\nBeing on the button is a huge advantage. I act last postflop, which gives me maximum information and control.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n2c 4s is a terrible hand. Even on the button, it's borderline unplayable. The only redeeming quality is being suited, but 2-4 offsuit would be worse.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack (94.5 BB). No need to take unnecessary risks with trash hands.\n\n**Potential Play:**\nWith position and both blinds having shown tendencies (SB tight, BB aggressive), I could consider a steal attempt. However:\n1. My hand has almost no postflop playability\n2. BB has shown aggression and might defend or 3-bet\n3. Even if I steal successfully, I only win 3 chips\n4. If I get called or raised, I'm playing a very weak hand out of position relative to the caller\n\nThe risk/reward isn't good. 2-4 suited is a hand I might consider limping with in some very specific multi-way pot situations, but not for a steal attempt from the button against an aggressive BB.\n\n**Decision:**\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot.

It has good implied odds if we hit a set (flop a 6). Preflop, it's ahead of many unpaired hands but vulnerable to overcards.\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is excellent - we get to act last on every street postflop.\n3. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop in both previous hands I saw (Hand #1 and Hand #2). This suggests they might be raising with a wide range, not just premium hands.\n4. **Pot Odds:** Pot is currently 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). We need to call 4 to win 9, giving us 2.25:1 pot odds (31% equity needed). Pocket sixes vs a typical raising range has around 40%+ equity.\n5. **Tournament Considerations:** We have a healthy stack (93.5 BB). Calling 4 chips (2 BB) is only 2.1% of our stack - very small risk.\n6. **Implied Odds:** If we hit a set (about 1 in 8.5 chance), we could win a big pot. Being in position helps us maximize value.\n7. **Alternatives:** We could raise, but with a medium pocket pair, we're often either flipping or dominated. Calling to see a flop and play in position is usually better.\n\n**Decision:** Call. The small investment relative to our stack, good position, and decent implied odds make this a profitable call. Folding would be too tight given the odds and position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket sixes in position with good pot odds (4 to win 9).

Being in position helps.\n\n**Decision**: I should call. Reasons:\n1. Decent pot odds (27.6% equity needed)\n2. Position advantage\n3. Opponent could be betting with draws or overcards\n4. If I hit a 6 on turn, I have a full house\n5. If turn is safe, I can reevaluate\n\nRaising seems risky since I could be behind to trips or overpairs.

Our hand is essentially a bluff catcher at this point. The board is Js Jh 7h 2s - very dry except for the flush draw. Our sixes give us a very weak hand - we're basically hoping opponent is bluffing or has a worse pocket pair.\n\n**Opponent analysis (from recall):**\nGPT-OSS-120B has been aggressive:\n- Hand #1: raised preflop, bet flop, bet turn\n- Hand #2: raised preflop, bet flop, bet turn, checked river\n- Recent hands: folded preflop twice (hands 4 & 5)\n\nThis opponent seems to be continuation betting frequently and showing aggression on multiple streets. They checked river in hand #2 after betting flop and turn.\n\n**Position:** We're on the button (BTN), which is good.\n\n**Pot odds:** Currently we can check for free. If we check and opponent bets on river, we'd need to evaluate pot odds then.\n\n**Our options:**\n1. **Check:** See a free river. This is the most conservative play. Given our weak hand and the paired board, we're likely behind unless opponent is bluffing.\n2. **Raise:** Could represent a Jack or a strong hand. However, with the board paired, raising might be risky as we could be up against trips or better. Also, we'd be bluffing with little equity.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** We have 87.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Decision:** I think checking is best. We have a marginal hand that could improve to a full house on the river (if a 6 comes), but more likely we're just hoping to catch a bluff. Checking keeps the pot small and allows us to evaluate the river. If opponent bets big on river, we can likely fold unless we improve.\n\nGiven the paired board and our weak hand relative to possible holdings (Jx, overpairs, 7x, etc.), checking seems optimal.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have information about GPT-OSS-120B's betting patterns. Looking at the history:\n- Hand #1: They raised preflop 6, bet flop 4, bet turn 8\n- Hand #2: They raised preflop 8, bet flop 6, bet turn 6, checked river\n- This hand: They raised preflop 6, bet flop 8, bet turn 8\n\nSo GPT-OSS-120B seems to be a consistent bettor across streets when they have initiative. They've shown willingness to bet multiple streets.\n\nNow, let me analyze my current situation:\n\nBoard: Js Jh 7h 2s\nMy hand: 6h 6d\nPot: 37 chips\nAmount to call: 8 chips\nMy stack: 175 chips (87.5 BB)\n\nMy hand is pocket sixes on a paired board with J-J-7-2. The board has two hearts (Js, 7h) but no flush yet. My sixes are likely not good here unless opponent is bluffing or has a worse pocket pair. The board is paired with Jacks, so anyone with a Jack has trips. There are straight draws possible (8-9-T or 9-T-Q) but less likely.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 45 (37 + 8). That's about 5.6:1 odds, or I need ~15% equity.\n\nWhat could opponent have? They raised preflop from seat 5 (cutoff), so their range includes: broadway cards, pocket pairs, suited connectors. They've bet flop and turn with smallish bets (8 each time, about 1/4 pot on flop, 1/4 pot on turn). This could be continuation betting with a wide range or value betting with a strong hand.\n\nMy sixes are likely behind against most value hands: AJ, KJ, QJ, TJ, any Jack, maybe pocket 7s for a full house, pocket 2s for a full house. I'm only beating pure bluffs or smaller pocket pairs (5s or lower).\n\nHowever, the small bet sizes suggest they might be betting for thin value or continuation. If they had trips or better, they might bet larger for value. But they could also be betting small to keep me in with a worse hand.\n\nGiven my position (BTN), I called preflop out of position, which is already questionable with 66. I've called flop and now turn. I'm getting decent pot odds (5.6:1). If I think I have at least 15% equity, I should call.\n\nWhat's my equity? Against a range of: JJ-AA, AJs+, KJs+, QJs, JTs, 77-99, I have about 18% equity. Against a tighter range of just trips+ (any J, 77, 22), I have about 8% equity. Against a bluff-heavy range, I could have 50%+ equity.\n\nThe opponent's history shows they bet multiple streets but also checked river in hand #2 when they had been betting. Could be they slow down with marginal hands.\n\nI have 175 chips, calling 8 is only 4.6% of my stack. The pot is 37, so I'm getting good odds. Even if I'm behind, I have implied odds if I hit a six on river (2 outs, ~4% chance). But that's not great.\n\nGiven the small bet size and decent pot odds, I think I should call and see river. If opponent checks river, I can check behind. If they bet river, I can fold unless I improve.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. I'm in a tournament, but stack sizes are healthy. Folding here preserves 8 chips but gives up pot. Calling keeps me in the hand with a chance to win if opponent is bluffing or has a worse hand.\n\nI'll call.",

Opponent is GPT-OSS-120B with 212 chips.\n\nThe hand history: preflop, GPT-OSS-120B raised to 6 from early position (seat 5), I called from BB with 66. Flop: Js Jh 7h, I checked, opponent bet 8, I called. Turn: 2s, I checked, opponent bet 8, I called. River: 5s, completing the board: Js Jh 7h 2s 5s.\n\nNow on river, I have 66, board has JJ with 7,2,5. My hand is essentially a bluff catcher - I beat only pure bluffs. Any J, any 7, any pocket pair higher than 6s, any flush (board has 3 spades), any straight (possible 8-9, 9-T, but board is J-J-7-2-5, so straights would be 8-9-T-J or 3-4-5-6-7? Actually 5-6-7-8-9 would be a straight, but I have 66, so 6 is part of that straight. Wait: board is J-J-7-2-5. Possible straights: 3-4-5-6-7 (using 5,6,7, plus 3,4) - but I have 66, so I have a 6, but need 3 and 4. That's unlikely. 5-6-7-8-9: need 8 and 9. Also unlikely. So straights are very unlikely.\n\nThe flush possibility: board has Js, 2s, 5s - three spades. Opponent could have a flush if they have two spades. The flush draw got there on river with 5s. So flush is possible.\n\nMy hand: pocket 6s, no spade. I have 6h 6d. So I'm losing to any J, any flush, any higher pocket pair (77+, though 77 is unlikely because board has a J and 7, but possible). Also any 7 (like A7, K7, etc) beats me because they have a pair of 7s with J kicker. Actually board has JJ, so any pair higher than 6 would be two pair: JJ + that pair. So 77, 22, 55 would be full house. Actually 77 would be full house (JJJ + 77). 22 would be full house. 55 would be full house. But those are unlikely.\n\nOpponent's range: They raised preflop from seat 5 (which is UTG? Actually seats: 1 folded, 2 folded, 3 is me (BTN/BB), 4 folded, 5 is UTG? Let's see: positions: Seat 1 is UTG? Actually typical 5-max: seat 1 UTG, seat 2 MP, seat 3 CO, seat 4 BTN, seat 5 SB? Wait blinds: Seat 2 posted SB, Seat 3 posted BB. So seat 5 is actually the button? No, I'm seat 3 (BTN) but posted BB because of blind positions. Let's reconstruct: Blinds are 1/2. Seat 2 posted SB 1, Seat 3 (me) posted BB 2. Then action: Seat 4 fold, Seat 5 raise 6. Seat 1 fold, Seat 2 fold, Seat 3 call. So Seat 5 is UTG (first to act after blinds). So they raised from UTG. That suggests a stronger range.\n\nThey bet flop and turn small: 8 into pot of ~? Preflop pot: 6 (raise) + 2 (BB) + 1 (SB) = 9? Actually SB posted 1, BB posted 2, UTG raised to 6 total. So pot preflop: 1+2+6 = 9. I called additional 4 (to match 6). So pot after preflop: 9+4 = 13? Wait: SB folded, so only UTG and me. Pot: SB 1 + BB 2 + UTG 6 = 9. I called additional 4 (to match 6). So pot = 9+4 = 13. Flop: I check, UTG bet 8 into 13. That's ~60% pot. I call. Pot becomes 13+8+8 = 29. Turn: I"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this river situation. I'm on the button with pocket 6s. Board is Js Jh 7h 2s 5s. Pot is 45 chips. I have 167 chips (83.5 BB). Opponent is GPT-OSS-120B with 212 chips.\n\nThe hand history: preflop, GPT-OSS-120B raised to 6 from early position (seat 5), I called from BB with 66. Flop: Js Jh 7h, I checked, opponent bet 8, I called. Turn: 2s, I checked, opponent bet 8, I called. River: 5s, completing the board: Js Jh 7h 2s 5s.\n\nNow on river, I have 66, board has JJ with 7,2,5. My hand is essentially a bluff catcher - I beat only pure bluffs. Any J, any 7, any pocket pair higher than 6s, any flush (board has 3 spades), any straight (possible 8-9, 9-T, but board is J-J-7-2-5, so straights would be 8-9-T-J or 3-4-5-6-7? Actually 5-6-7-8-9 would be a straight, but I have 66, so 6 is part of that straight. Wait: board is J-J-7-2-5. Possible straights: 3-4-5-6-7 (using 5,6,7, plus 3,4) - but I have 66, so I have a 6, but need 3 and 4. That's unlikely. 5-6-7-8-9: need 8 and 9. Also unlikely. So straights are very unlikely.\n\nThe flush possibility: board has Js, 2s, 5s - three spades. Opponent could have a flush if they have two spades. The flush draw got there on river with 5s. So flush is possible.\n\nMy hand: pocket 6s, no spade. I have 6h 6d. So I'm losing to any J, any flush, any higher pocket pair (77+, though 77 is unlikely because board has a J and 7, but possible). Also any 7 (like A7, K7, etc) beats me because they have a pair of 7s with J kicker. Actually board has JJ, so any pair higher than 6 would be two pair: JJ + that pair. So 77, 22, 55 would be full house. Actually 77 would be full house (JJJ + 77). 22 would be full house. 55 would be full house. But those are unlikely.\n\nOpponent's range: They raised preflop from seat 5 (which is UTG? Actually seats: 1 folded, 2 folded, 3 is me (BTN/BB), 4 folded, 5 is UTG? Let's see: positions: Seat 1 is UTG? Actually typical 5-max: seat 1 UTG, seat 2 MP, seat 3 CO, seat 4 BTN, seat 5 SB? Wait blinds: Seat 2 posted SB, Seat 3 posted BB. So seat 5 is actually the button? No, I'm seat 3 (BTN) but posted BB because of blind positions. Let's reconstruct: Blinds are 1/2. Seat 2 posted SB 1, Seat 3 (me) posted BB 2. Then action: Seat 4 fold, Seat 5 raise 6. Seat 1 fold, Seat 2 fold, Seat 3 call. So Seat 5 is UTG (first to act after blinds). So they raised from UTG. That suggests a stronger range.\n\nThey bet flop and turn small: 8 into pot of ~? Preflop pot: 6 (raise) + 2 (BB) + 1 (SB) = 9? Actually SB posted 1, BB posted 2, UTG raised to 6 total. So pot preflop: 1+2+6 = 9. I called additional 4 (to match 6). So pot after preflop: 9+4 = 13? Wait: SB folded, so only UTG and me. Pot: SB 1 + BB 2 + UTG 6 = 9. I called additional 4 (to match 6). So pot = 9+4 = 13. Flop: I check, UTG bet 8 into 13. That's ~60% pot. I call. Pot becomes 13+8+8 = 29. Turn: I",

          "reasoning_content": "No showdowns. Need to think: My hand 66 is weak. Pot is 45, I need to raise 8 to 53. If I raise, opponent can call or fold. If opponent folds, I win 45 chips. If opponent calls, I lose 8 chips (the raise) plus pot? Actually if opponent calls, they match my raise, then showdown: I lose because 66 loses to most hands. So I would lose 8 chips (my raise) plus the pot? Actually I'd lose the pot 45 and my raise 8? Let's think: If I raise to 8, opponent calls, pot becomes 45+8+8 = 61. Then showdown: I lose, so I lose 8 chips (my contribution) and don't get pot. So EV = if opponent folds p%: +45, if calls (1-p%): -8. Need p > 8/(45+8) = 8/53 \u2248 15%. So if I think opponent will fold >15% of time, raising is profitable.\n\nWill opponent fold? They have a flush? They have 212 chips, healthy stack. They might have a flush (spade flush). If they have flush, they'd call. If they have weak hand, they might fold. But they've been betting aggressively (bet flop and turn). That suggests they have a decent hand. However, they might be bluffing with weak hand. But they bet 8 on flop and turn, which is moderate. Could be a middling hand.\n\nGiven I have 66, board has JJ with 7,2,5. Opponent's hand could be something like a flush (spade flush), or a pair like 77, 22, 55, or a J (like AJ, KJ), or a straight (unlikely). Many possibilities beat 66. Only hands that lose to 66 are pure bluffs: no pair, no flush, no straight, no J. But they might have a pair lower than 6 (like 44, 33) but board has 2 and 5, so 22 and 55 are possible but those are full house (JJ + 22). Actually 22 would be full house, which beats 66. So any pair with board cards gives full house, which beats 66. So opponent needs no pair, no J, no flush, no straight. That's relatively rare.\n\nThus p (fold probability) is low. Likely <15%. So raising is -EV.\n\nBetter to check (fold). Actually check means I'm not raising, just passing. But I can check (no raise) and then opponent can check or raise? Wait, amount to call is 0, so I can check (do nothing). If I check, opponent can raise or check. If opponent raises, I can call or fold. But if opponent raises, I'll have to decide to call or fold. That's better because I get to see opponent's action before committing. However, if I check and opponent checks, showdown occurs and I likely lose. If opponent raises, I can then decide to call or fold based on raise amount.\n\nBut checking might allow opponent to raise, which could be a bluff if they have weak hand. But they might raise small to try to steal. However, they have been betting 8 each street, so maybe they'll raise 8 again. If they raise 8, I can call (if I think I'm beat) or fold. If I fold, I lose 0 chips. If I call, I lose 8 chips. So better to fold if they raise.\n\nThus checking is safer: I can see opponent's raise amount, then decide to fold if they raise (or call if I think I might win). But if they check, I lose showdown but lose 0 extra.\n\nThus check seems best.\n\nLet's consider tournament: I have 167 chips, good stack. No need to risk chips.\n\nI'll check.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 66 is weak vs board with JJ and possible flush.

This is the river street - final decision point\n2. Opponent (Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B) has bet 45 chips\n3. From recall: Seat 5 has been playing aggressively in previous hands (betting at each street)\n4. I have a pair of sixes - not a great hand but not terrible either\n5. The board shows Js Jh (pair of jacks), which might be relevant\n6. I've folded all 5 previous hands - haven't won any chips yet\n\n**Pot odds**: 90 chips in pot, need to risk 45 to call\n- If I call, I risk 45 to win 90 (2:1 pot odds)\n- If I raise to 90, I risk 90 to win 90 (1:1 pot odds)\n\n**Hand strength**: Pair of sixes is decent. Board has Js Jh (pair) which might mean opponent has a jack or is bluffing. My 6h matches the heart suit on board (7h, Jh), which could be relevant.\n\n**Tournament consideration**: I have 167 chips, which is decent. I've folded all hands so far, so I need to start accumulating chips. However, losing 45 chips on a bad call hurts my stack.\n\n**Opponent behavior**: Seat 5 has been betting consistently in previous hands (not folding much). In hand #2, they checked on river, suggesting they might be more conservative at river when they have weak hands.\n\nGiven this is river and opponent bet 45 (half pot), this could be a bluff or a legitimate bet. With a pair of sixes, I have some strength. The pot odds are favorable (2:1) for calling.\n\nHowever, I should consider: if I fold, I lose nothing but gain nothing. If I call and win, I gain 90 chips. If I call and lose, I lose 45 chips.\n\nMy pair of sixes is decent but not strong. The opponent might be betting because they have a jack or better hand. But they could also be bluffing.\n\nGiven I need to start accumulating chips in the tournament and the pot odds are favorable, I should probably call. A raise to 90 seems too aggressive given my hand strength.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Favorable 2:1 pot odds with decent pair of sixes.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm on the button with A8o. The blinds are 1/2, and my stack is 121 chips (60.5 BB). The small blind (MiniMax-M2) and big blind (GPT-OSS-120B) are yet to act after me.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has folded 7 out of 8 times preflop, only called once in hand #4. Very tight player.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has shown some aggression - raised in hand #6 preflop to 6, and bet on multiple streets. Has folded 3 times preflop.\n\nMy hand: A8o is a marginal hand. Ace-high with weak kicker. On the button, this is a reasonable steal candidate against tight blinds.\n\nPosition: Being on the button is a huge advantage - I get to act last postflop.\n\nStack sizes: I have 60.5 BB, which is healthy but not huge. SB has 96 BB, BB has 150 BB.\n\nTournament considerations: I haven't won a hand yet (0 wins, 6 folds, 1 loss). I need to accumulate chips. The blinds will come around again soon.\n\nGiven the tight tendencies of the SB (folds 87.5% of the time preflop) and the BB's mixed but not overly aggressive profile, raising from the button with A8o could be profitable. Even if called, I have position and an Ace which dominates some weaker Ax hands.\n\nHowever, A8o is not a great hand for calling. If I just call 2 chips, I'll be playing a multi-way pot out of position against the blinds, which is not ideal. Better to either raise or fold.\n\nPot odds: It's 2 chips to call into a 3 chip pot (1.5:1 odds), but position matters more.\n\nI think the best play is to raise to 6 chips total (4 more). This is a standard button raise that puts pressure on the blinds. If they fold, I win 3 chips. If called, I have position.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations... The minimum raise is to 4 total, but raising to 6 (3x BB) is standard.\n\nDecision: Raise to 6.",

There's also a backdoor flush draw with diamonds on board, but I don't have a diamond. My hand has very little showdown value currently - just Ace-high.\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nGPT-OSS-120B seems to be an aggressive player. Looking at their actions:\n- Hand #2: Bet flop, bet turn, check river\n- Hand #6: Raised preflop, bet flop, bet turn, bet river (big bet of 45)\nThey appear to be continuation betting frequently and applying pressure.\n\n**Board analysis:**\nThe board is Q\u2666 J\u2666 3\u2665 9\u2660. This is a fairly wet board with straight and flush draws. My opponent checked the turn after checking the flop. Given their aggressive tendencies, this check might indicate weakness or a slow play.\n\n**Position:**\nI have position on the opponent (they act before me on each street).\n\n**Stack sizes:**\nI have 115 chips, opponent has 296. Pot is 13. A bet of 6-8 chips would be reasonable.\n\n**Decision considerations:**\n1. **Check:** Take a free card. My hand needs improvement. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to see a river card cheaply.\n2. **Bet:** Try to take down the pot now with a bluff. Given opponent's check on both flop and turn, they might be weak. A bet could win the pot immediately.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I'm at 57.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take excessive risks.\n\n**Pot odds:** If I bet, I need fold equity to justify it.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have position\n- Opponent checked twice (flop and turn)\n- Opponent is generally aggressive but showing weakness here\n- I have some draw equity (gutshot to straight)\n- My hand has minimal showdown value\n\nI think a small bet could be profitable. If I bet 6 chips (half pot), I need the opponent to fold about 30% of the time to be profitable. Given their check-check line, they might fold many hands that missed this board.\n\nHowever, checking is also reasonable to see a free river card. But if I check, I give up any chance to win the pot immediately, and I'll likely have to fold to any river bet if I don't improve.\n\nGiven my aggressive image from raising preflop, a continuation bet here could work well. I'll make a small bet to apply pressure."

If I bet 6 chips (half pot), I need the opponent to fold about 30% of the time to be profitable. Given their check-check line, they might fold many hands that missed this board.\n\nHowever, checking is also reasonable to see a free river card. But if I check, I give up any chance to win the pot immediately, and I'll likely have to fold to any river bet if I don't improve.\n\nGiven my aggressive image from raising preflop, a continuation bet here could work well. I'll make a small bet to apply pressure.",

My stack is 128 chips (64 BB), which is healthy but not huge. The blinds are 1/2.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Hand strength: A3o is a weak ace, easily dominated. From UTG, standard play is to fold most weak aces.\n2. Position: I'm first to act preflop, which is terrible with a weak hand.\n3. Opponent tendencies: Looking at the data:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression (bet and raise on flop in hand 9)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Raised to 6 in hand 7 from some position\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Called and raised in hand 9\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has called and shown down decent hands (AJ, JT)\n4. Tournament considerations: With 64 BB, I can afford to be patient and wait for better spots.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 to win 3 (pot is 3). That's 1.5:1 odds, but with a weak hand out of position, this is not good.\n\nGiven that I'm UTG with A3o, and there are 4 players left to act behind me (including the big blind), this is an easy fold. Even if I hit an ace on the flop, I could be dominated by better aces. The reverse implied odds are bad.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack and wait for a better spot in better position.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nWe're in the BB with 6s 8c - a very weak hand (off-suit, low cards, no connectors). Our stack is 126 chips (63 BB).\n\nAction: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8 from late position, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called, then Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) re-raised to 24 total.\n\nWe need to call 22 more chips to continue. The pot is currently 42 chips (blinds 1+2 + raise 8 + call 8 + re-raise 24? Actually let me calculate: blinds 1+2=3, plus Seat 5's 8 = 11, plus Seat 1's call 8 = 19, plus Seat 2's re-raise to 24 total means they put in 23 more (since they already had 1 SB), so pot is 3+8+8+23=42 chips).\n\nWe have to call 22 into a pot of 42, giving us pot odds of roughly 1.9:1 (22 to win 64 total if we call). That's about 34% equity needed.\n\nWith 6s 8c, we have a terrible hand preflop. Even against a wide range, we have maybe 30-35% equity at best. But we're likely facing strong hands here:\n\n1. Seat 5 raised from late position (could be wide)\n2. Seat 1 called (could be medium strength)\n3. Seat 2 re-raised from SB position - this is likely very strong. Looking at their history: in hand #7 they raised preflop to 6, and in hand #10 they called. They seem somewhat active but not hyper-aggressive.\n\nAdditionally, Seat 1 still has to act after us, and they've already called the initial raise. They might call or re-raise again.\n\nOur hand has very little playability postflop. 6-8 offsuit doesn't flop well - we need two pair or better to feel comfortable, and even then we're vulnerable to overcards.\n\nStack preservation is important: we have 63 BB, which is healthy but not huge. Losing 22 chips (17% of our stack) with a weak hand in a multi-way pot with a re-raiser is dangerous.\n\nTournament considerations: We should avoid marginal spots with weak hands, especially when facing aggression.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown some aggression preflop but not excessive\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has raised preflop before and shown down decent hands (TJ, AJ)\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called a raise, so likely has a playable hand\n\nThe re-raise from Seat 2 suggests a strong hand, possibly QQ+, AK, maybe JJ/TT. We're dominated by almost all of those.\n\nEven if we flop a pair, we'll be playing out of position with a weak kicker against likely strong ranges.\n\nThe pot odds are borderline, but implied odds are poor because we're out of position and our hand is weak. Reverse implied odds are high - we could easily lose a lot if we hit a marginal hand.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. We have plenty of chips to be patient.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

The opponent Kimi-K2 in seat 2 raised to 6 (3x BB). I need to call 5 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is currently 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise).\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: Kimi-K2 has raised preflop twice before (hand 7 and hand 11). In hand 7 they raised to 6, same as now. In hand 11 they raised to 24 (much larger). They've folded preflop 3 times, called once. So they seem somewhat active but not overly aggressive.\n\nWith 4d7c offsuit, this is a bottom-tier hand. Even from the small blind, calling with such a weak hand is generally not good. The pot odds: I need to call 5 to win 9, which is about 1.8:1 odds or 35.7% equity needed. 4d7c has about 30-35% equity against a typical raising range, but that's against random cards. Against a real raising range, it's worse.\n\nPosition is bad - I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand. Stack preservation is important in tournaments. My stack is 125 chips, which is healthy but not huge. Calling 5 chips (4% of my stack) isn't terrible, but I'll be playing a weak hand out of position.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. The small blind is a tough position, but with such a weak hand, folding is correct. I could consider a raise as a bluff, but with 4d7c it's too weak even for that, and I'd be risking too much.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. The big blind (MiniMax-M2) is still to act behind me if I call. They could squeeze. So folding seems best.\n\nDecision: fold.",

As a button player, I have position advantage, but with such a weak hand, it's marginal.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position. However, there are still two players left to act: SB (MiniMax-M2) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B). The SB has already posted 1 chip, BB posted 2 chips.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I have 125 chips (62.5 BB), which is healthy but not huge. MiniMax-M2 has 179 chips, GPT-OSS-120B has 300 chips (biggest stack).\n\n4. **Action so far**: Everyone folded to me on the button. I need to call 2 chips to see the flop.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a decent stack but not massive. My win rate is low (1 win in 12 hands). I should be selective but also look for opportunities.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Pot is 3 chips, I need to call 2 chips, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds (40% equity needed). My hand doesn't have anywhere near 40% equity against random hands.\n\n7. **Implied odds**: With position, if I hit a good flop (like a straight draw or two pair), I could win more chips. But 5-4 offsuit is a \"speculative\" hand at best.\n\n8. **Alternative actions**: \n   - Fold: Conservative but probably correct with such a weak hand\n   - Call: Speculative play hoping to hit something\n   - Raise: Would be a bluff/squeeze play since everyone folded to me\n\nGiven that I'm on the button and everyone folded, I could consider a raise to try to steal the blinds. However, the SB and BB are still to act. With 5-4 offsuit, this is a very weak hand to raise with.\n\nLooking at my history: I've been folding a lot (10 folds in 12 hands). I won one hand from the button with A8o. My opponents don't seem overly aggressive based on limited data.\n\nThe most prudent play is to fold this weak hand. While button position is tempting, 5-4 offsuit is just too weak to play, especially with two players still to act. I should wait for better spots.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"5-4 offsuit is too weak to play even from the button with two players left to act.

Folding too tight given stack depth. Raise aims to take initiative and avoid playing marginal hand out of position against multiple opponents.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I have pocket 8s from UTG position with 125 chips (62.5 BB). Blinds are 1/2. Seat 5 posted SB, Seat 1 posted BB, Seat 2 folded. I'm first to act.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot (11 folds in 13 hands, only 1 win). My stack is 125 chips, which is middle of the pack - Seat 5 has 302, Seat 1 has 182, Seat 4 has 179.\n\nPocket 8s is a medium pair. From UTG, it's borderline. In tournament poker, medium pairs can be tricky from early position because if someone raises behind, I'll have to fold or play a marginal hand out of position.\n\nLooking at opponent raising tendencies: GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has raised preflop multiple times (hands 2, 6, 10, 11). They seem aggressive. Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has also raised preflop (hands 7, 11, 12). MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) hasn't shown preflop raises but did raise on flop once.\n\nGiven my UTG position and the aggressive players behind me (especially Seat 5 who has raised 4 times preflop), calling with 88 could be problematic. If I call, players behind might raise, putting me in a tough spot. Raising might be better to define my hand, but raising from UTG with 88 is also risky.\n\nConsidering my stack size (62.5 BB), I have room to play. But tournament considerations: I need to preserve chips and pick better spots. 88 from UTG is marginal.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips (after my call, pot would be 5). That's 2:5 or 40% pot odds, which is too high for 88 to need to win. But implied odds if I hit a set could be good.\n\nHowever, with aggressive players behind, I might face a raise and have to fold, wasting 2 chips. Or I could raise to 4-6 chips to try to take it down or play heads-up.\n\nActually, looking at the table dynamics, Seat 5 (SB) and Seat 1 (BB) are yet to act after me. Seat 5 has been aggressive but is in SB position. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) act after me.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best play is to raise. A small raise to 4-6 chips might get folds from marginal hands. If I get called or raised, I can reassess on the flop. Folding seems too tight for 88 with 62.5 BB. Calling invites trouble.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips (3x BB). This is a standard raise size. Let's see.",

This is a weak hand preflop, especially from the SB.\n\n2. **Position**: SB (worst position postflop). Will be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\n3. **Stack**: 126 chips (63 BB). Decent stack but not huge.\n\n4. **Action so far**: SB (Seat 2) posted SB 1, I posted BB 2, MiniMax-M2 called 2, GPT-OSS-120B folded, Kimi-K2 Thinking folded, and Kimi-K2 (SB) called the additional 1. So the action is on me in the BB with 0 to call.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Kimi-K2 (SB) has raised twice in 5 hands (hands 11 and 12) but folded last 3 hands. Seems somewhat active.\n   - MiniMax-M2 has folded all 5 hands preflop - very tight player.\n   - Both opponents seem to be playing fairly tight recently.\n\n6. **Pot**: 6 chips currently (SB 1 + BB 2 + MiniMax call 2 + Kimi-K2 call 1).\n\n7. **My options**: \n   - Check: See a free flop with weak suited hand\n   - Raise: Try to take down the pot now\n   - Fold: Not an option since it's free\n\nWith 4d Td suited, checking to see a free flop is the best play. This hand has some potential if we hit a flush draw or straight draw, but it's too weak to raise from out of position. Raising would be spewy with this hand against two opponents. Checking gives us a free look at the flop with a hand that can make strong draws.\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 has been folding every hand, there's a chance they might fold to a raise, but Kimi-K2 already called from SB and might defend. Better to take the free flop.\n\nI'll check.",

The board has a king high and a 5, so there are some straight draws possible (QJ, J9, 89). I have bottom pair essentially, but I do have a backdoor flush draw with diamonds (I have 4d Td, board has 5h Tc Kh - no diamonds on board yet). So I have middle pair weak kicker and backdoor flush draw.\n\nI'm first to act on the flop after Seat 2 checked. Pot is 6 chips. I can check or raise. Folding is an option but seems weak given I have a pair.\n\nLet me think about opponents. Seat 2 is Kimi-K2 (not the thinking version), Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2. Both called preflop. They could have various hands: suited connectors, small pairs, broadway cards. The king on board might hit some of their hands.\n\nI should check to see what happens. If I check, Seat 4 gets to act. He might bet if he has a king or a draw. I could then call if the bet is small, or fold if large. Raising could be an option as a semi-bluff or for protection, but with middle pair weak kicker, I'm not that strong. If I raise and get called, I'm likely behind or dominated.\n\nBetter to check and see the action. If checked around, I get a free turn card. If someone bets, I can evaluate.\n\nLet me use tools to recall opponent tendencies. First, recall opponent actions for Seat 2 and Seat 4.",

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the SB with 4d Td. The board is 5h Tc Kh. I have middle pair with Ten, but it's a weak kicker (4). The board has a King and a Ten, so there are higher cards out there.\n\nPot is 14 chips, and I need to call 4 chips. That's about 3.5:1 pot odds. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) bet 4, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been very tight, folding most hands preflop. In hand #9, they called preflop, then raised on flop to 8, then folded. So they're capable of betting/raising postflop but also folding to aggression.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown some aggression (raised preflop in hands 11 and 12) but also calls.\n\nMy hand: I have middle pair with weak kicker. The board is K T 5 rainbow (hearts, clubs? Actually 5h Tc Kh - so hearts and clubs). I have bottom pair with a 4 kicker. Actually wait, I have Td, board has Tc, so I have a pair of Tens. But there's a King on board, so anyone with a King beats me. Also straight draws possible (QJ, 98, etc.).\n\nPosition: I'm in SB, so will be out of position for rest of hand. That's a disadvantage.\n\nStack sizes: I have 126 chips (63 BB). Seat 4 has 173, Seat 2 has 201.\n\nThe bet is small - 4 into 14 pot. Could be a probe bet with a draw or weak hand. Seat 2 called, which suggests they have something like a Ten with better kicker, a draw, or maybe a weak King.\n\nGiven my weak kicker and being out of position, calling seems marginal. However, I do have a pair, and the pot odds are decent (3.5:1). If I improve to two pair or trips on turn, I could win more.\n\nBut there's risk: if I call and turn brings an Ace, Queen, Jack, or another King, I could be in trouble. Also, if I'm already behind to a King, I'm drawing to 2 outs (two remaining Tens).\n\nAlternative: I could raise to try to take it down now. A raise to 8-12 might get folds. But if called, I'm committing more chips with a marginal hand.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 63 BB, which is healthy but not huge. I should preserve chips.\n\nLet me think about implied odds: If I hit trips on turn, I could win a big pot. But I'm out of position, which makes extracting value harder.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: I have 4d Td. Board is 5h Tc Kh. I have middle pair, Ten with 4 kicker. The board has a King, which is concerning. The bettor (Seat 4) has been tight preflop but showed aggression postflop in one hand. Could be betting with a King, a draw, or a weaker Ten.\n\nThe caller (Seat 2) likely has something like a Ten with better kicker, a draw, or maybe a weak King.\n\nIf I fold, I lose nothing more. If I call, I invest 4 chips (3% of my stack) with 3.5:1 odds. That's mathematically okay if I have ~22% equity or more.\n\nWhat's my equity? Against a range of top pair (Kx), other Tens, and draws, I probably have around 25-35% equity. So pot odds justify a call.\n\nBut position is bad. And if I call, I'll face turn betting possibly.\n\nI could consider raising to 12-16 to try to win now. If they fold, I win 18 pot (14 + 4). Risking 12 to win 18 is okay if they fold often.\n\nGiven Seat 4's tightness and previous fold to aggression in hand #9, a raise might work. Seat 2 called a bet but might fold to a raise.\n\nBut if they call or re-raise, I'm in trouble.\n\nGiven my stack size and tournament, I think calling is reasonable. Folding is also okay. Raising is aggressive.\n\nI'll call and see turn. If I improve, I can continue. If not, I can fold to further betting. The investment is small (4 chips).\n\nLet me check if there are any flush draws: I have diamonds, board has hearts and clubs. No flush draw for me.\n\nActually, wait: I have 4d Td, board 5h Tc Kh. No flush draws possible yet"

The board has a King and a Ten, so there are higher cards out there.\n\nPot is 14 chips, and I need to call 4 chips. That's about 3.5:1 pot odds. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) bet 4, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been very tight, folding most hands preflop. In hand #9, they called preflop, then raised on flop to 8, then folded. So they're capable of betting/raising postflop but also folding to aggression.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown some aggression (raised preflop in hands 11 and 12) but also calls.\n\nMy hand: I have middle pair with weak kicker. The board is K T 5 rainbow (hearts, clubs? Actually 5h Tc Kh - so hearts and clubs). I have bottom pair with a 4 kicker. Actually wait, I have Td, board has Tc, so I have a pair of Tens. But there's a King on board, so anyone with a King beats me. Also straight draws possible (QJ, 98, etc.).\n\nPosition: I'm in SB, so will be out of position for rest of hand. That's a disadvantage.\n\nStack sizes: I have 126 chips (63 BB). Seat 4 has 173, Seat 2 has 201.\n\nThe bet is small - 4 into 14 pot. Could be a probe bet with a draw or weak hand. Seat 2 called, which suggests they have something like a Ten with better kicker, a draw, or maybe a weak King.\n\nGiven my weak kicker and being out of position, calling seems marginal. However, I do have a pair, and the pot odds are decent (3.5:1). If I improve to two pair or trips on turn, I could win more.\n\nBut there's risk: if I call and turn brings an Ace, Queen, Jack, or another King, I could be in trouble. Also, if I'm already behind to a King, I'm drawing to 2 outs (two remaining Tens).\n\nAlternative: I could raise to try to take it down now. A raise to 8-12 might get folds. But if called, I'm committing more chips with a marginal hand.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 63 BB, which is healthy but not huge. I should preserve chips.\n\nLet me think about implied odds: If I hit trips on turn, I could win a big pot. But I'm out of position, which makes extracting value harder.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: I have 4d Td. Board is 5h Tc Kh. I have middle pair, Ten with 4 kicker. The board has a King, which is concerning. The bettor (Seat 4) has been tight preflop but showed aggression postflop in one hand. Could be betting with a King, a draw, or a weaker Ten.\n\nThe caller (Seat 2) likely has something like a Ten with better kicker, a draw, or maybe a weak King.\n\nIf I fold, I lose nothing more. If I call, I invest 4 chips (3% of my stack) with 3.5:1 odds. That's mathematically okay if I have ~22% equity or more.\n\nWhat's my equity? Against a range of top pair (Kx), other Tens, and draws, I probably have around 25-35% equity. So pot odds justify a call.\n\nBut position is bad. And if I call, I'll face turn betting possibly.\n\nI could consider raising to 12-16 to try to win now. If they fold, I win 18 pot (14 + 4). Risking 12 to win 18 is okay if they fold often.\n\nGiven Seat 4's tightness and previous fold to aggression in hand #9, a raise might work. Seat 2 called a bet but might fold to a raise.\n\nBut if they call or re-raise, I'm in trouble.\n\nGiven my stack size and tournament, I think calling is reasonable. Folding is also okay. Raising is aggressive.\n\nI'll call and see turn. If I improve, I can continue. If not, I can fold to further betting. The investment is small (4 chips).\n\nLet me check if there are any flush draws: I have diamonds, board has hearts and clubs. No flush draw for me.\n\nActually, wait: I have 4d Td, board 5h Tc Kh. No flush draws possible yet",

Board has a King, so anyone with Kx beats me. Straight draws possible (QJ, 98, etc.).\n\nOpponents: Seat 4 bet 4 (small bet), Seat 2 called. Seat 4 has been tight preflop but showed aggression postflop in one hand. Seat 2 has shown some aggression.\n\nStack: I have 126 chips (63 BB), healthy but not huge.\n\nPot odds: 4 to call into 18 pot (14 + 4 from Seat 4 + 4 from Seat 2? Actually pot is 14, Seat 4 bet 4, Seat 2 called 4, so pot would be 22 if I call. Need to call 4 to win 22, so 5.5:1 odds. That's even better than I thought.\n\nWait, recalc: Preflop pot was 8 (SB 1 + BB 2 + call 2 + call 1? Let's see: SB posted 1, I posted BB 2, Seat 4 called 2, Seat 5 folded, Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 called 1 more. So that's 1+2+2+1=6. Actually that's 6. Then flop: Seat 2 check, I check, Seat 4 bet 4, Seat 2 called 4. So pot is 6+4+4=14. Right.\n\nIf I call, pot becomes 14+4=18. So I'm calling 4 to win 18, which is 4.5:1 odds.\n\nI need about 18% equity to call. My equity against reasonable ranges is probably higher.\n\nPosition is bad, but with such good pot odds, calling seems correct. I can fold on turn if I don't improve and face more betting.\n\nRaising is possible but risky with marginal hand out of position.\n\nFolding seems too tight given pot odds.\n\nI'll call.",

The board shows 5h Tc Kh Ad. This gives me:\n- Bottom pair (tens)\n- No flush draw (my diamonds don't match board)\n- No straight draw (4-5-6-7-8 would be possible but I have 4 and board has 5, T, K, A - no straight potential)\n- Weak kicker (4)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall:\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has been folding a lot preflop (6 of last 7 hands), but in hand #9 they called preflop, then raised on flop to 8, then folded. They bet 4 on the flop this hand.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has shown some aggression with raises preflop (hands 11, 12), but checked flop and turn this hand. They called the 4 bet on flop.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Flop action: Seat 4 bet 4, Seat 2 called, I called\n- Turn: Ace comes, Seat 2 checks\n- Pot is 18 chips\n- I have position on Seat 4 (they act after me)\n\n**Potential Hands:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Could have a wide range after limping preflop. Their flop bet of 4 into ~6 pot is small. Could be testing with weak hand, could have hit something like a pair, or could have a draw.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Checked flop and turn. Called flop bet. Could have a weak pair, draw, or speculative hand.\n\n**My Hand's Prospects:**\n- I have bottom pair with weak kicker\n- The Ace on turn is scary - could have hit many hands\n- I'm vulnerable to any king, ace, or better ten\n- If Seat 4 bets again, I'll likely need to fold\n- If checked through, I might see a free river\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 122 chips (61 BB) - decent stack\n- Pot is only 18 chips\n- Risk vs reward: Not much to gain, significant risk\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven my weak hand, the scary Ace on turn, and the fact that Seat 4 could still bet behind me, checking is the prudent play. I want to see what Seat 4 does and potentially see a free river. Raising with bottom pair weak kicker on this board is too speculative.\n\nBest action: check."

The board shows 5h Tc Kh Ad. This gives me:\n- Bottom pair (tens)\n- No flush draw (my diamonds don't match board)\n- No straight draw (4-5-6-7-8 would be possible but I have 4 and board has 5, T, K, A - no straight potential)\n- Weak kicker (4)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall:\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has been folding a lot preflop (6 of last 7 hands), but in hand #9 they called preflop, then raised on flop to 8, then folded. They bet 4 on the flop this hand.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has shown some aggression with raises preflop (hands 11, 12), but checked flop and turn this hand. They called the 4 bet on flop.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Flop action: Seat 4 bet 4, Seat 2 called, I called\n- Turn: Ace comes, Seat 2 checks\n- Pot is 18 chips\n- I have position on Seat 4 (they act after me)\n\n**Potential Hands:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Could have a wide range after limping preflop. Their flop bet of 4 into ~6 pot is small. Could be testing with weak hand, could have hit something like a pair, or could have a draw.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Checked flop and turn. Called flop bet. Could have a weak pair, draw, or speculative hand.\n\n**My Hand's Prospects:**\n- I have bottom pair with weak kicker\n- The Ace on turn is scary - could have hit many hands\n- I'm vulnerable to any king, ace, or better ten\n- If Seat 4 bets again, I'll likely need to fold\n- If checked through, I might see a free river\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 122 chips (61 BB) - decent stack\n- Pot is only 18 chips\n- Risk vs reward: Not much to gain, significant risk\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven my weak hand, the scary Ace on turn, and the fact that Seat 4 could still bet behind me, checking is the prudent play. I want to see what Seat 4 does and potentially see a free river. Raising with bottom pair weak kicker on this board is too speculative.\n\nBest action: check.",

I have position on Seat 4 who bet the flop. The pot is 18 chips. Amount to call is 0, so I can check. Raising seems bad with such a weak hand. Checking to see what Seat 4 does makes sense.

Could have a draw or weak hand.\n\n**My Hand Strength:**\n- I have middle pair, but board has A, K, T, 5\n- Many better hands beat me: any A, K, two pair, sets, straights\n- My kicker is terrible (4)\n- I have backdoor flush potential (diamonds) but only one diamond on board\n- I'm basically playing for trips or two pair improvement\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 61 BB, which is healthy but not huge\n- Calling 4 chips into 30 is reasonable pot odds\n- However, I could be drawing thin if behind\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Pot odds good (13.3% equity needed)\n2. Hand is marginal but has some showdown value\n3. Opponents' small bets suggest weakness\n4. I could improve to trips or two pair on river\n5. Position is poor (SB) but will act first on river\n\nGiven the small bet size and decent pot odds, I think a call is reasonable. Folding seems too tight for the price. Raising doesn't make sense with such a marginal hand.\n\nI'll call and see the river.",

          "content": "Let me analyze the current situation. I'm in the SB with 4d Td. Board is 5h Tc Kh Ad 6c. I have a pair of tens with a 4 kicker. This is a relatively weak hand. The board shows Ace high, King, Ten, 6, 5. There are no flushes possible (all different suits). Possible straights: QJ would make a straight (but not on board), 7-8 would make a straight, 9-J would make a straight.\n\nMy hand: pair of tens. I'm beating bluffs, but losing to any Ace, King, two pair, sets, straights.\n\nPot is 30 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) checked. I can check or raise. If I check, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) will act. He's been betting small amounts (4 chips) on flop and turn. He might bet again on river.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from search results:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop several times (hands 7, 11, 12). Seems aggressive preflop. In this hand, he just called preflop, checked flop, called bet, checked turn, called bet, checked river. This seems like a weak line - maybe a draw that missed or a weak pair.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): From hand 9, he raised on flop with 2d 6d on board 5h Js Jh when facing a bet, then folded to a re-raise. Seems capable of aggression but also folds to pressure. In this hand, he limped preflop, bet 4 on flop, bet 4 on turn. Small bets could be probing/value betting a weak hand or trying to steal.\n\nMy stack: 118 chips (59 BB). I've invested 2 (BB) + 4 (flop) + 4 (turn) = 10 chips so far. I have 108 chips left.\n\nIf I check, MiniMax-M2 might bet. If he bets small again (like 4 chips), I'd have to decide whether to call with my pair of tens. Pot would be 34 (if he bets 4), so I'd be getting 34:4 = 8.5:1 odds. That's good odds, but my hand might be no good.\n\nIf I raise, I could try to take it down now. But raising would be risky - if MiniMax-M2 has a real hand, he might call or re-raise. And Kimi-K2 might wake up with something.\n\nActually, wait. I should think about what hands make sense. MiniMax-M2 limped preflop, bet small on flop and turn. Could have Ace-rag, King-rag, maybe a draw that missed (like QJ for gutshot, or 78 for open-ended). Board: 5h Tc Kh Ad 6c. Draws that missed: QJ (needs Q or J), 78 (needs 7 or 8), 79 (needs 7 or 9), 89 (needs 8 or 9). Also flush draws impossible.\n\nHe could have a weak Ace (A2-A9), weak King (KQ, KJ, KT, K9, etc.), two pair (AT, KT, maybe A5, A6), sets (TT, 55, 66, KK, AA but unlikely given preflop limp).\n\nMy pair of tens with 4 kicker is weak. I'm only beating bluffs and maybe some random low pairs like 99, 88, 77, etc. But those hands might not bet flop and turn.\n\nActually, let me check: I have second pair with weak kicker. On this board with Ace and King, many better hands exist.\n\nI think checking is best. If MiniMax-M2 bets small, I might call getting good odds. If he bets big, I can fold.\n\nBut wait - I'm first to act after seat 2 checked. I could try a small bet to fold out weak hands. But seat 4 is the aggressor this hand - he's been betting. He might interpret a bet from me as strength and fold his bluffs, but call with better hands.\n\nActually, I should consider that seat 2 checked. He might have a weak hand. Seat 4 might check behind with a weak hand too.\n\nIf I check, and seat 4 checks behind, we go to showdown. My pair of tens might win if both have nothing.\n\nIf I bet, I risk getting raised by seat 4 who has been betting.\n\nGiven my weak hand and the fact that I'm out of position (SB), checking seems prudent. Let the aggressor (seat 4) decide what to do.\n\nI'll check."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation. I'm in the SB with 4d Td. Board is 5h Tc Kh Ad 6c. I have a pair of tens with a 4 kicker. This is a relatively weak hand. The board shows Ace high, King, Ten, 6, 5. There are no flushes possible (all different suits). Possible straights: QJ would make a straight (but not on board), 7-8 would make a straight, 9-J would make a straight.\n\nMy hand: pair of tens. I'm beating bluffs, but losing to any Ace, King, two pair, sets, straights.\n\nPot is 30 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) checked. I can check or raise. If I check, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) will act. He's been betting small amounts (4 chips) on flop and turn. He might bet again on river.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from search results:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop several times (hands 7, 11, 12). Seems aggressive preflop. In this hand, he just called preflop, checked flop, called bet, checked turn, called bet, checked river. This seems like a weak line - maybe a draw that missed or a weak pair.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): From hand 9, he raised on flop with 2d 6d on board 5h Js Jh when facing a bet, then folded to a re-raise. Seems capable of aggression but also folds to pressure. In this hand, he limped preflop, bet 4 on flop, bet 4 on turn. Small bets could be probing/value betting a weak hand or trying to steal.\n\nMy stack: 118 chips (59 BB). I've invested 2 (BB) + 4 (flop) + 4 (turn) = 10 chips so far. I have 108 chips left.\n\nIf I check, MiniMax-M2 might bet. If he bets small again (like 4 chips), I'd have to decide whether to call with my pair of tens. Pot would be 34 (if he bets 4), so I'd be getting 34:4 = 8.5:1 odds. That's good odds, but my hand might be no good.\n\nIf I raise, I could try to take it down now. But raising would be risky - if MiniMax-M2 has a real hand, he might call or re-raise. And Kimi-K2 might wake up with something.\n\nActually, wait. I should think about what hands make sense. MiniMax-M2 limped preflop, bet small on flop and turn. Could have Ace-rag, King-rag, maybe a draw that missed (like QJ for gutshot, or 78 for open-ended). Board: 5h Tc Kh Ad 6c. Draws that missed: QJ (needs Q or J), 78 (needs 7 or 8), 79 (needs 7 or 9), 89 (needs 8 or 9). Also flush draws impossible.\n\nHe could have a weak Ace (A2-A9), weak King (KQ, KJ, KT, K9, etc.), two pair (AT, KT, maybe A5, A6), sets (TT, 55, 66, KK, AA but unlikely given preflop limp).\n\nMy pair of tens with 4 kicker is weak. I'm only beating bluffs and maybe some random low pairs like 99, 88, 77, etc. But those hands might not bet flop and turn.\n\nActually, let me check: I have second pair with weak kicker. On this board with Ace and King, many better hands exist.\n\nI think checking is best. If MiniMax-M2 bets small, I might call getting good odds. If he bets big, I can fold.\n\nBut wait - I'm first to act after seat 2 checked. I could try a small bet to fold out weak hands. But seat 4 is the aggressor this hand - he's been betting. He might interpret a bet from me as strength and fold his bluffs, but call with better hands.\n\nActually, I should consider that seat 2 checked. He might have a weak hand. Seat 4 might check behind with a weak hand too.\n\nIf I check, and seat 4 checks behind, we go to showdown. My pair of tens might win if both have nothing.\n\nIf I bet, I risk getting raised by seat 4 who has been betting.\n\nGiven my weak hand and the fact that I'm out of position (SB), checking seems prudent. Let the aggressor (seat 4) decide what to do.\n\nI'll check.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand:** 7d Ah (Ace-seven offsuit)\n**Position:** Button (best position)\n**Stack:** 117 chips (58.5 BB)\n**Blinds:** 1/2\n**Pot:** 3 chips (SB + BB)\n**Amount to call:** 1 (to complete from SB to BB)\n\n**Opponent analysis:** MiniMax-M2 (BB) has folded 6 out of 7 hands preflop. Only called once from BB last hand (hand 16). So they seem fairly tight/foldy from BB.\n\n**My position:** Button is the best position - I get to act last postflop.\n\n**Hand strength:** A7o is a marginal hand. Ace-high with weak kicker. However, in position against a single opponent (BB) who has been folding a lot, this could be a good spot to steal the blinds.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 1 to win 3, so 3:1 pot odds (33% equity needed). A7o likely has >33% equity against a random BB hand.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 58.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. Not desperate.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Could be reasonable since A7o is weak.\n2. **Call:** Complete to see a flop cheaply in position.\n3. **Raise:** Try to steal the blinds given opponent's fold tendency.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: they've folded 6/7 times from BB. Only called once. This suggests they're folding a lot to preflop raises. A raise to 6 (3x BB) might take it down immediately.\n\nGiven my position and opponent's tightness, a raise seems optimal. If they call, I have position and can play postflop well. If they fold, I win 3 chips with minimal risk.\n\nI should raise to 6 (3x BB). This is a standard button raise size. Let's calculate: minimum raise is to 4, but 6 is better sizing.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 6,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Button position with A7o against tight BB who has folded 6/7 hands preflop.

When they did play (hand 16), they had KdJs and bet postflop. Seems tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised 3 out of 10 times preflop, folded 6 times. Seems somewhat aggressive but not overly so.\n\n**My position and hand:**\nBeing on the button with a pocket pair is strong. Pocket 4s have good implied odds - if I hit a set on the flop, I can win a big pot. The price is only 2 chips to call (1.7% of my stack).\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have 60 BB, which is a healthy stack. Folding a small pocket pair on the button seems too tight. Calling is reasonable to see a flop cheaply. Raising could also be an option to take initiative, but with 44, I prefer playing for set value.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 2 to win 5 (3 pot + 2 from BB if SB folds, or 3 pot + 1 from SB if they call). That's 2.5:1 odds, which is good for set mining (set odds are about 7.5:1, but implied odds make up for it).\n\n**Decision:** I should call. If I raise, I'm bloating the pot with a weak hand that doesn't play well postflop without a set. Calling keeps the pot small and allows me to realize my equity cheaply. If I miss the flop, I can easily fold to aggression.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns I should consider... Looking at my own history: I won hand 14 with pocket 8s from CO with a raise, and hand 17 with A7s from SB with a raise. I've been playing somewhat aggressively when I have decent hands.\n\nGiven the tight tendencies of the SB and the fact that BB has folded to button raises before (hand 15, 16, 17), a raise might get folds. But with 44, I prefer the set mining approach.\n\nI'll call."

I have to call 2 to win a pot of 9 (7+2). That's 4.5:1 pot odds.\n\nMy hand: pocket 4s, so I have a small pocket pair. The flop is 8h 2h 9s, which is relatively dry except for the heart flush draw. My hand is basically bottom pair with a gutshot straight draw (I need a 5 for a straight, though 4-5-6-7-8, actually wait 4-5-6-7-8 would be a straight, but the board is 8-9-2, so I'd need 5-6-7 for a straight, that's not a gutshot - actually 4-5-6-7-8 would be a straight, but the board has 8-9-2, so I'd need specifically 5-6-7 to make a straight, that's not realistic. Actually with 44 on 892 board, I have no straight draws. Just bottom pair.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: GPT-OSS-120B has bet on the flop 4 out of 5 times when they've been in position to bet on the flop (hand 1, 2, 6, 10 they bet, hand 8 they checked). They seem to be aggressive postflop. They also raised preflop several times (hands 10, 11, 15). They have a big stack of 301 chips vs my 118.\n\nGiven the small bet size (2 into 7, about 29% pot), this could be a continuation bet with a wide range. The BB checked preflop, so they could have any two cards. My 44 has showdown value as bottom pair, but it's vulnerable to overcards and draws.\n\nWith 4.5:1 pot odds, I only need about 18% equity to call. Even with bottom pair, I likely have at least 30% equity against a random hand. However, if they have an overpair, two overcards, or a draw, my equity varies.\n\nGiven my position (button), I have position advantage for future streets. My stack is 118 (59 BB), which is medium-short but not desperate.\n\nI think calling is reasonable here. Folding seems too tight given the price. Raising could be an option to take the pot away, but with bottom pair and a flush draw on board, I might get called by better hands or draws.\n\nLet me consider: If I call, pot becomes 11. If turn bricks, they might check and I can take a free card, or bet if checked to. If turn brings an overcard or completes draws, I can reevaluate.\n\nGiven opponent's aggression, they might fire another barrel on turn. But with position, I can control the action.\n\nI'll call."

I need to call 6.\n\nMy hand: 44 with board 8h 2h 9s 2s. I have a pair of 4s, but there's a pair of 2s on board. My hand is essentially bottom pair with 4s, but the board has 2 pair (2s and 8/9). Actually wait: board shows 8h 2h 9s 2s - so there are two 2s on board, making it a pair of 2s on board. My 4s are not matching anything on board, so I have just pocket 4s, which is a weak hand.\n\nThe board is relatively dry: 8h 2h 9s 2s. There's a flush draw with hearts (8h, 2h on board plus turn 2s is spades). I have 4s 4h - I have the 4h, so I have one heart. Not a flush draw.\n\nWhat could opponent have? They bet small on flop (2 into ~6 pot) and now bet 6 into 15 on turn. This is a 40% pot bet. Looking at opponent's history: they frequently bet on turn (4 times in 10 hands). They seem aggressive.\n\nMy stack: 116 chips (58 BB). Opponent has 295 chips. I'm on the button.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 6 to win 21 (15 + 6). That's about 3.5:1 odds, or ~22% equity needed.\n\nWhat hands could I be beating? Possibly opponent has a draw (hearts), Ace-high, or a smaller pocket pair. But they could also have a 2 (trips), a 9, an 8, or an overpair.\n\nGiven the board paired 2s, it's less likely they have a 2 since 2x hands are rarely played preflop from BB after I limped. But possible.\n\nMy hand has some implied odds if I hit a 4 (2 outs) for quads, or backdoor straight draw? 4s could give me a straight with 5-6-7? Actually board is 8-2-9-2, so 4 doesn't help much.\n\nActually, I should consider that I limped preflop from BTN with 44. Opponent checked BB. They led small on flop (2 into 6), I called. Now they bet turn.\n\nThis looks like they could be betting for value with a hand like 9x, 8x, or a 2. Or they could be bluffing with a draw.\n\nGiven my weak hand (bottom pair that's actually worse than board pairs), I should probably fold. But let me think about opponent tendencies more.\n\nFrom the data: opponent has bet turn in 4 of 4 hands where we have data. They seem to be aggressive on turns. Could be continuation betting.\n\nMy hand has some showdown value but very weak. Pot odds are decent (22% equity needed). Do I have 22% equity?\n\nAgainst a reasonable range: top pair (9x, 8x), overpairs (TT+, maybe 77?), draws (hearts), trips (2x). Against this range, my 44 has maybe 15-20% equity? Let me think: against trips (2x) I'm drawing dead except to quads. Against top pair (9x), I have 2 outs. Against overpairs, I have 2 outs. Against draws, I'm ahead but vulnerable.\n\nActually, if opponent has a draw, I'm currently ahead but could lose on river.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and my medium stack (58 BB), I should be cautious. Folding seems reasonable.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting 3.5:1 odds. If I think opponent is bluffing sometimes, maybe I should call? However, my hand has little improvement potential (only 2 outs to quads).\n\nActually, I have 2 outs to quads (4s), and maybe some runner-runner straight possibilities? Unlikely.\n\nI think fold is correct. Let me check if there's any history of opponent bluffing on turn.\n\nSearch for showdowns with this opponent."

Seems tight.\n2. **MiniMax-M2:** Has folded 7 out of 10 hands preflop, called BB once, and showed aggression postflop in one hand.\n3. **GPT-OSS-120B:** Has raised twice preflop, folded 5 times, checked once in BB. Shows some aggression.\n\n**My hand analysis:** K5o is a very weak hand, especially from UTG. It's not suited, not connected, and has reverse implied odds (if I hit a K, I could be dominated by better Kx hands). In early position with this weak hand, standard play is to fold.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 58 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands from early position.\n\n**Position:** Being UTG is terrible for this hand. I have to act first on every street, making it hard to realize equity.\n\n**Potential actions:**\n- **Fold:** Correct with K5o from UTG\n- **Call:** Would put 2 chips in, but then I'm out of position with a weak hand against potentially 3 opponents\n- **Raise:** Would be a bluff, but K5o doesn't have good bluffing properties\n\n**Pot odds:** Need to call 2 to win 5 (current 3 + my 2), so getting 2.5:1.

The blinds are 1/2, so I need to call 2 chips to see the flop.\n\nFrom my hand history, I can see that in hand #15 when I was UTG with 9d 2h, I folded. That's a similarly weak hand. 65o is a terrible hand to play from UTG - it's unsuited, low cards, no connectivity except for a straight draw possibility. Playing this from early position is generally a losing proposition.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised preflop before. There are 4 players left to act after me (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, and the blinds).

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: 2c 8d - This is a very weak hand. 2-8 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. It has very little potential to make strong hands post-flop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, which means I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand if I call. This is a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 112 chips (28 BB), which is a medium stack. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 166 chips (41.5 BB).\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**: From the data, Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has:\n   - Only raised once preflop in 20 hands (hand #4, raised to 4)\n   - Mostly folds preflop (14 folds)\n   - Called once preflop (hand #11, called 8)\n   - Showed pocket 8s in hand #2\n   - Has been relatively tight/passive preflop\n\n5. **The bet**: Seat 1 raised to 12 total (8 more to call). This is a 3x raise from UTG. Given their tight tendencies, this likely represents a strong hand.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise). I need to call 8 to win 18, giving me 2.25:1 pot odds (31% equity needed). My hand has nowhere near 31% equity against a likely strong UTG raising range.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 28 BB, I need to preserve my stack. Getting involved with 2-8o out of position against what's likely a strong hand is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n8. **Alternatives**: Folding is clearly correct. Calling would be a huge mistake. Raising with this hand would be even worse.\n\nThe only reasonable play is to fold. I'm getting poor pot odds with a terrible hand against a likely strong opponent range, and I'm out of position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2-8 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands.

          "content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand**: Tc Ts (pocket tens) - a strong starting hand\n**Position**: SB (small blind) - not great position, but we're facing a raise from UTG (seat 1)\n**Stack**: 110 chips (27.5 BB) - relatively short stack\n**Pot**: 18 chips currently\n**Amount to call**: 10 chips\n**Minimum raise to**: 20 chips (total, not additional)\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has folded 9 times preflop in a row before this hand\n- This is their first raise in the last 10 hands (hand #21)\n- They showed down pocket 8s in hand #2\n\nMy own history:\n- I've been playing tight (folded 16 of 21 hands)\n- Won 3 hands (with raises preflop in two of them)\n- Current stack is below average (110 vs others with 172, 193, 195, 312)\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Pocket tens is a premium hand, especially with my stack size. It's top 3% of starting hands.\n2. **Opponent tendencies**: The raiser has been very tight (folded 9 straight hands), so their raise likely indicates a strong hand (maybe JJ+, AK, AQs). But since this is their first raise, they could also be opening up their range.\n3. **Stack considerations**: With 27.5 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Pocket tens is definitely a hand worth getting all-in with preflop.\n4. **Position**: Being in SB is bad, but the BB hasn't acted yet. However, BB is seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) with 195 chips.\n5. **Options**:\n   - **Fold**: Too weak with pocket tens\n   - **Call**: 10 chips to call into 18 pot (1.8:1 odds). Could set up a flop play, but out of position\n   - **Raise**: Minimum raise to 20 (8 more chips) or 3-bet bigger\n\nGiven my stack size, I should consider a 3-bet or even shove. Let me calculate:\n- If I raise to 20: total investment 20 (I already put 2 SB)\n- If I go all-in: 110 total\n\nThe pot is 18, opponent raised to 12. If I raise to 20, they need to call 8 more. If they call, pot would be ~40. If they fold, I win 18.\n\nBut with pocket tens and a short stack, I should consider a more aggressive line. A 3-bet to ~30-40 might be good, but I only have 110 total. Actually, a shove might be best here - it puts maximum pressure, and if called, I'm likely ahead of many hands except JJ+, AK.\n\nHowever, let me think about tournament survival. I have 27.5 BB, which is still playable. A shove risks my tournament life. But pocket tens is strong.\n\nActually, considering the opponent's tightness and this being their first raise, they might have a very strong hand. But pocket tens is still good.\n\nI think a 3-bet to around 30-35 is reasonable. That's about 25-30% of my stack, committing me to the hand. But actually, with 110 total, raising to 35 leaves me with 75 behind, pot would be ~50, so I'd be pot-committed anyway.\n\nGiven stack sizes, I think a shove is appropriate. Let me check: if I shove for 110, opponent has to call 98 more into pot of 128 (18 + 110). They're getting about 1.3:1 odds. They'd need ~43% equity to call. If they have JJ+, AK, they have good equity against TT.\n\nBut actually, a shove might fold out hands like AQ, AJ, KQ that might call a smaller raise. And it puts maximum pressure on hands like JJ that might be unsure.\n\nWait, but the BB still needs to act. If I raise small, BB might come along. If I shove, BB likely folds unless they have a monster.\n\nGiven everything, I think a shove is best. Pocket tens is strong, my stack is short-ish, and I want to maximize fold equity and potentially double up.\n\nBut let me consider a smaller 3-bet first. Actually, with 110 total, raising to 30 leaves me with 80 behind. Pot would be 50. Any flop bet would commit me. So I'm effectively all-in anyway.\n\nI think shoving is cleaner and maximizes fold equity. If called, I'm likely racing against overcards or slightly behind an overpair.\n\n"

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand**: Tc Ts (pocket tens) - a strong starting hand\n**Position**: SB (small blind) - not great position, but we're facing a raise from UTG (seat 1)\n**Stack**: 110 chips (27.5 BB) - relatively short stack\n**Pot**: 18 chips currently\n**Amount to call**: 10 chips\n**Minimum raise to**: 20 chips (total, not additional)\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has folded 9 times preflop in a row before this hand\n- This is their first raise in the last 10 hands (hand #21)\n- They showed down pocket 8s in hand #2\n\nMy own history:\n- I've been playing tight (folded 16 of 21 hands)\n- Won 3 hands (with raises preflop in two of them)\n- Current stack is below average (110 vs others with 172, 193, 195, 312)\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Pocket tens is a premium hand, especially with my stack size. It's top 3% of starting hands.\n2. **Opponent tendencies**: The raiser has been very tight (folded 9 straight hands), so their raise likely indicates a strong hand (maybe JJ+, AK, AQs). But since this is their first raise, they could also be opening up their range.\n3. **Stack considerations**: With 27.5 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Pocket tens is definitely a hand worth getting all-in with preflop.\n4. **Position**: Being in SB is bad, but the BB hasn't acted yet. However, BB is seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) with 195 chips.\n5. **Options**:\n   - **Fold**: Too weak with pocket tens\n   - **Call**: 10 chips to call into 18 pot (1.8:1 odds). Could set up a flop play, but out of position\n   - **Raise**: Minimum raise to 20 (8 more chips) or 3-bet bigger\n\nGiven my stack size, I should consider a 3-bet or even shove. Let me calculate:\n- If I raise to 20: total investment 20 (I already put 2 SB)\n- If I go all-in: 110 total\n\nThe pot is 18, opponent raised to 12. If I raise to 20, they need to call 8 more. If they call, pot would be ~40. If they fold, I win 18.\n\nBut with pocket tens and a short stack, I should consider a more aggressive line. A 3-bet to ~30-40 might be good, but I only have 110 total. Actually, a shove might be best here - it puts maximum pressure, and if called, I'm likely ahead of many hands except JJ+, AK.\n\nHowever, let me think about tournament survival. I have 27.5 BB, which is still playable. A shove risks my tournament life. But pocket tens is strong.\n\nActually, considering the opponent's tightness and this being their first raise, they might have a very strong hand. But pocket tens is still good.\n\nI think a 3-bet to around 30-35 is reasonable. That's about 25-30% of my stack, committing me to the hand. But actually, with 110 total, raising to 35 leaves me with 75 behind, pot would be ~50, so I'd be pot-committed anyway.\n\nGiven stack sizes, I think a shove is appropriate. Let me check: if I shove for 110, opponent has to call 98 more into pot of 128 (18 + 110). They're getting about 1.3:1 odds. They'd need ~43% equity to call. If they have JJ+, AK, they have good equity against TT.\n\nBut actually, a shove might fold out hands like AQ, AJ, KQ that might call a smaller raise. And it puts maximum pressure on hands like JJ that might be unsure.\n\nWait, but the BB still needs to act. If I raise small, BB might come along. If I shove, BB likely folds unless they have a monster.\n\nGiven everything, I think a shove is best. Pocket tens is strong, my stack is short-ish, and I want to maximize fold equity and potentially double up.\n\nBut let me consider a smaller 3-bet first. Actually, with 110 total, raising to 30 leaves me with 80 behind. Pot would be 50. Any flop bet would commit me. So I'm effectively all-in anyway.\n\nI think shoving is cleaner and maximizes fold equity. If called, I'm likely racing against overcards or slightly behind an overpair.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to output a JSON object with action, raise_to, and reasoning. Let me reconsider the decision.\n\nI have pocket tens in SB facing an UTG raise. My stack is 110 (27.5 BB). The pot is 18, I need to call 10. Minimum raise to 20.\n\nOptions: fold, call, raise. With pocket tens, fold is too weak. Call could be okay but out of position. Raise is good.\n\nWhat raise size? Minimum raise to 20 is only 8 more chips than calling. That's not much of a 3-bet. Could raise bigger. With 110 total, a standard 3-bet might be to 30-35. Or shove all-in for 110.\n\nLet me think about opponent's range. They've been tight, folded 9 hands in a row. Their first raise could be strong: maybe JJ+, AK, AQs. Maybe wider since they might be opening up.\n\nIf they have JJ+, I'm in bad shape. If they have AK, AQ, I'm ahead. Pocket tens is ahead of many hands.\n\nWith my stack size, a shove is reasonable. But I have 27.5 BB, which isn't super short. In tournament play, 20+ BB is still playable. Shoving with TT might be a bit aggressive but acceptable.\n\nAlternative: 3-bet to 30-35. That commits about 1/3 of my stack. If called, pot is ~50, I have 75-80 behind. Then on flop, I'm basically committed anyway.\n\nActually, with 110 total, if I raise to 35, I have 75 behind. Pot would be ~55. Any reasonable c-bet would commit me. So I'm effectively all-in.\n\nShoving simplifies things. Gets max fold equity. If called, I'm racing.\n\nBut wait, the BB still has to act. If I raise to 35, BB might call with position. If I shove, BB likely folds unless they have a monster.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, I want to accumulate chips. TT is a good hand to do that with.\n\nI think I'll go with a shove. It's a strong move with a strong hand.\n\nSo action: raise, raise_to: 110 (all-in).\n\nReasoning: Pocket tens is a premium hand with my stack size. Shoving maximizes fold equity and simplifies post-flop play. Opponent has been tight but this is their first raise, so their range may include hands like AJ+, KQ that will fold to a shove. If called, I'm likely racing against overcards or slightly behind an overpair, which is acceptable given pot odds and tournament dynamics.\n\nLet me output JSON.",

I have the Tc, so I have one club. The turn brought the Kh, which is a bad card for me - adds another overcard.\n\nBut wait, I only have 2 chips left! I posted SB of 2 preflop, then raised 110?

But the action says \"Seat 3 raise 110\" - that must be a mistake or I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the \"raise 110\" is what I would have raised to if I had chips? Actually, I think the system is showing the raise amount relative to something. Let me think: I have 2 chips. I posted SB 2, so I have 0 left? Wait, I posted SB 2 from my stack of 2, leaving me with 0. But then I raised? That doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: I have 2 chips (0.5 BB). That means I'm essentially all-in already. The pot is 224 chips, which includes my all-in bet. Seat 1 called my all-in. On flop and turn, since I'm all-in, there's no more betting for me. I just check because I have no chips left. The action shows \"flop: Seat 3 check\" and \"flop: Seat 1 check\". Now turn, amount to call is 0, legal actions are fold, check. I can't fold when I'm all-in - I have to see the hand through. I should check.\n\nBut wait, I have the option to fold? That's weird if I'm all-in. Maybe I'm not all-in? Let me check the pot size again. Blinds 2/4. Seat 1 raised to 12. I have 2 chips. If I go all-in for 2 chips, that's just calling 2 (since I already posted 2 as SB). Actually, I posted SB 2, so to call the raise of 12, I need to put in 10 more. But I only have 2 total, so I can only put in 2 total. That means my all-in is 2 chips total, which is less than the raise. Seat 1 raised to 12, I call all-in for 2. Then Seat 1 gets back change? Actually, in poker, if someone raises and another player goes all-in for less, there's a side pot. But the main pot includes my all-in amount.\n\nLet me calculate: SB 2, BB 4, Seat 1 raises to 12. I have 2 chips total. I can only put in 2. So I'm all-in for 2. The main pot would be: my 2 + SB 2? Wait, I already posted SB 2 from my 2 chips, so I have 0 left.

But I'm already all-in by posting the SB. Hmm.\n\nMaybe the system shows \"raise 110\" but that's not accurate because I don't have that many chips. Let me use the recall tools to understand better.

Board: 8c As 5c Kh. Amount to call: 0. Legal actions: fold, check.\n\nKey points:\n1. I have pocket tens - a medium pair\n2. Board has A, K, 8, 5 with two clubs\n3. I have the Tc, giving me a club flush draw possibility\n4. My stack is only 2 chips - I'm essentially all-in or very close to it\n5. The pot is huge (224 chips) relative to my stack\n6. I'm getting infinite pot odds since I don't have to put anything more in\n\nGiven that amount to call is 0 and I can check, I should check to see the river. Even though my hand is weak against an A or K, I have some equity with:\n- Two tens for a set (2 outs)\n- Backdoor straight possibilities? Not really with this board\n- Flush draw with Tc (need two more clubs)\n\nActually, I have one club already (Tc). Board has 8c and 5c, so I need two more clubs on turn and river. The turn is Kh (not a club), so I need river to be a club. That's 9 outs (13 clubs total - 3 visible = 10 remaining, but one is the T\u2663 which I already have, so 9 clubs left).\n\nWait, I have Tc, board has 8c and 5c. That's 3 clubs total. 13 clubs in deck - 3 = 10 clubs left. But I already have Tc, so actually 9 other clubs could help. Plus 2 tens for a set. So total 11 outs.\n\nBut I'm getting infinite pot odds (0 to call for 224 pot). Even with weak equity, I should check and see the river. Folding would be terrible when it costs nothing.\n\nActually, can I fold when I'm all-in? In tournament poker, if you're all-in, you can't fold - you have to see the hand through. But the system is giving me fold as an option. Maybe I'm not technically all-in? Let me check the stack sizes again.\n\nI have 2 chips. Blinds are 2/4. I posted SB 2. That would leave me with 0. But the system says my stack is 2 chips. Maybe the 2 chips is what I have left after posting? Actually, if I start with 2 chips and post SB 2, I'd have 0. But the system shows \"Your Stack: 2 chips\". Maybe that's my starting stack for this hand? Or maybe I have 2 chips left after previous action?\n\nLet me look at the preflop action: \"Seat 3 raise 110\". That suggests I raised to 110, which is impossible with 2 chips. This might be a display issue. But regardless, current situation: amount to call is 0, I can check. I should check.\n\nActually, thinking about tournament strategy: I have 0.5 BB. That's critically short. I need to double up soon. This pot is huge. Even with weak hand, I should see it through since it costs nothing.\n\nMy reasoning: With 0 chips to call, checking gives me a chance to win a huge pot. Folding would be throwing away any chance. My tens have some equity against various hands. Opponent checked flop, which might indicate weakness or trapping with a strong hand like AK, AA, KK. But still, free chance to win.\n\nI'll check.",

Amount to call is 12, but I only have 2 chips total. This is a critical tournament situation.\n\nKey facts:\n- I have only 2 chips, which is 0.5 BB\n- I'm on the button with ATo\n- Pot is currently 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 12)\n- I have to call 12, but I only have 2 chips, so effectively I'm going all-in for my last 2 chips\n- Looking at opponent history: Kimi-K2 has folded many hands recently (hands 17-22 all folded preflop), but just raised to 12 this hand\n\nAnalysis:\n1. My stack is critically short at 0.5 BB. I'm essentially forced to go all-in with any remotely playable hand.\n2. ATo is actually a premium hand for my situation. With only 2 chips, I need to double up or bust.\n3. The pot odds are incredible: I'm putting in 2 chips to win at least 18 chips (9:1 odds).\n4. Even if Kimi-K2 has a strong hand, ATo has decent equity against most ranges.\n5. Tournament considerations: With 0.5 BB, I'm in \"push-or-fold\" territory. I should be pushing with a wide range, and ATo is well above my pushing threshold.\n\nGiven that I only have 2 chips and \"call\" would put me all-in anyway, I should call. I can't raise because I don't have enough chips for the minimum raise (20 total, I only have 2).\n\nWait, let me check: The amount to call is 12, but I only have 2 chips. So if I call, I'm putting in my last 2 chips and going all-in. The remaining players behind me (SB and BB) still have to act after me.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions: only \"fold\" and \"call\" are available. No \"raise\" option, which makes sense since I don't have enough chips to raise to 20.\n\nDecision: I should call (go all-in) with ATo. This is a clear +EV spot given my stack size and hand strength."

Amount to call is 12, but I only have 2 chips total. This is a critical tournament situation.\n\nKey facts:\n- I have only 2 chips, which is 0.5 BB\n- I'm on the button with ATo\n- Pot is currently 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + raise 12)\n- I have to call 12, but I only have 2 chips, so effectively I'm going all-in for my last 2 chips\n- Looking at opponent history: Kimi-K2 has folded many hands recently (hands 17-22 all folded preflop), but just raised to 12 this hand\n\nAnalysis:\n1. My stack is critically short at 0.5 BB. I'm essentially forced to go all-in with any remotely playable hand.\n2. ATo is actually a premium hand for my situation. With only 2 chips, I need to double up or bust.\n3. The pot odds are incredible: I'm putting in 2 chips to win at least 18 chips (9:1 odds).\n4. Even if Kimi-K2 has a strong hand, ATo has decent equity against most ranges.\n5. Tournament considerations: With 0.5 BB, I'm in \"push-or-fold\" territory. I should be pushing with a wide range, and ATo is well above my pushing threshold.\n\nGiven that I only have 2 chips and \"call\" would put me all-in anyway, I should call. I can't raise because I don't have enough chips for the minimum raise (20 total, I only have 2).\n\nWait, let me check: The amount to call is 12, but I only have 2 chips. So if I call, I'm putting in my last 2 chips and going all-in. The remaining players behind me (SB and BB) still have to act after me.\n\nActually, looking at the legal actions: only \"fold\" and \"call\" are available. No \"raise\" option, which makes sense since I don't have enough chips to raise to 20.\n\nDecision: I should call (go all-in) with ATo. This is a clear +EV spot given my stack size and hand strength.",

I'll call.\n\nSo my response should be:\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A4s in position with good pot odds (3.25:1). Calling to see flop with position advantage against cutoff raise.\"\n}\n\nWait, but actually I'm in the BB, not button. Let me re-read: \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\". It says BTN. But the actions show: Seat 2 post_sb 1, Seat 3 post_bb 2. That means I'm actually the big blind, not button. The button is seat 3? Actually BTN means button. So I'm the button, but I posted BB? That seems inconsistent. Let me check: \"Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 198 chips\" and \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\". So I'm seat 3, which is button. But the actions show \"Seat 3 post_bb 2\". That means button posted big blind? That's unusual. Maybe it's a tournament with antes or something? Actually blinds are 1/2. SB is seat 2, BB is seat 3. So button is in BB position this hand. That means I'm out of position postflop. That changes things.\n\nIf I'm in the BB, I'm out of position. That makes A4s weaker. But I'm getting a good price: need to call 4 into pot of 9. That's still 2.25:1 pot odds (9:4). Actually pot is 9 (SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 6). I need to call 4 more. So total pot after my call would be 13. My pot odds are 4 to win 9+4=13, so 13:4 = 3.25:1, which is 23.5% equity needed.\n\nA4s against a typical cutoff raising range has about 30% equity. So pot odds are okay. But being out of position reduces implied odds. However, we're both deep (99 BB effective).\n\nI think calling is still okay given the price. Folding might be too tight. Raising could be an option as a 3-bet bluff, but with A4s I'd rather not 3-bet out of position.\n\nI'll stick with call.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with A4 offsuit. The flop is Td 5d 7h rainbow except for two diamonds. I have a backdoor flush draw with the A\u2666, but otherwise my hand is weak - just Ace high with no pair. The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) raised preflop from the cutoff to 6 chips (3x BB), and I called from the big blind.\n\nNow the flop comes, and it's my action first since the preflop raiser is in position. The pot is 13 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise + 4 call = 13). I have 194 chips left.\n\nI need to decide what to do. My hand is weak - Ace high with a backdoor flush draw and backdoor straight possibilities (though unlikely with A4). The board is fairly dry with T-5-7 rainbow. The preflop raiser could have a wide range here since it's just heads-up.\n\nGiven that I'm out of position and have a weak hand, I should consider checking and seeing what the opponent does. If I check and he bets, I'll have to decide whether to continue. With Ace high and a backdoor flush draw, I might have some equity, but not much.\n\nPot odds: If I check and he bets, say half pot (6-7 chips), I'd be getting about 3:1 odds. My equity against a range of pairs, Broadway cards, etc. is probably around 25-30% at best. But with just Ace high, I'd likely need to improve to win.\n\nAlternative: I could lead out with a small bet to try to take the pot down now. A bet of 4-5 chips (30-40% pot) might get folds from hands like KQ, QJ, or smaller pocket pairs. But if he raises, I'm in a tough spot.\n\nGiven that I have no information on this opponent (no history found), and this appears to be early in the tournament, I should play somewhat cautiously. Checking seems reasonable to see what the opponent does.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 97 BB, so I'm deep. No need to take big risks with marginal hands. But also, being on the button gives me some positional advantage in future streets, though I'm actually out of position in this hand since I called from BB.\n\nActually wait - I'm on the button, but I was the big blind. So I'm actually out of position for this hand. The opponent is in position.\n\nGiven all this, I think checking is the best play. If the opponent checks behind, I get a free card to potentially improve. If he bets, I can evaluate based on bet size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Weak hand with only Ace high and backdoor flush draw.

Actually, with A4 on T-5-7 board, I have a gutshot to a 6 (making 4-5-6-7 straight). Weak hand overall.\n\n2. **Board texture:** T\u2666 5\u2666 7\u2665 - fairly dry board except for diamond flush draw. My A\u2660 is not a diamond, so I only have one diamond (4\u2666). The board doesn't connect well with typical raising ranges.\n\n3. **Opponent's range:** Seat 5 raised from late position (CO or BTN? Actually Seat 5 is after folded seats, so likely late position). Range could be wide. The small 4-chip bet on flop (23.5% pot) could be a continuation bet with a wide range, trying to take it down with any two cards.\n\n4. **Pot odds:** Pot is 17 + 4 = 21 chips. Need to call 4 chips. That's 4:21 or about 1:5.25 pot odds (19% equity needed). \n\n5. **My equity:** Against a reasonable range (pairs, broadways, suited connectors), I estimate I have around 25-30% equity with my A-high + backdoor draws. The gutshot gives me 4 outs (6s), and the backdoor flush draw adds some equity. Aces might be good sometimes if opponent has complete air.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** I have 97 BB stack, healthy. Folding loses nothing. Calling keeps me in the hand with position (I act last on future streets).\n\n7. **Position advantage:** I'm on the BTN, which is great position. I get to see opponent's turn action before I act.\n\n8. **Bet sizing tells:** The small bet (4 into 17) looks like a probe or weak continuation bet. Could be trying to get a cheap look at turn or thin value with medium strength.\n\nGiven the pot odds (19% needed), my estimated equity (25-30%), position advantage, and the small bet size suggesting weakness, I should call. Raising might be an option to take it down now, but with my weak hand and backdoor draws, I prefer to call and reassess on turn.\n\nHowever, let me think about the gutshot more carefully: I need a 6. There are 4 sixes in the deck. That's about 8% equity just from the straight. Backdoor flush draw adds maybe 4% more. Ace might be good sometimes. So maybe 15-20% equity total. Still, with 19% needed, it's close.\n\nActually, the pot odds calculation: 4 to win 25 (21 current + my 4 call) = 16% equity needed. Wait, recalc: Pot before bet: 17. Opponent bets 4, making pot 21. I need to call 4 to win 25 (21+4). So 4/25 = 16% equity needed.\n\nWith 16% needed and estimated 15-20% equity, it's a marginal call.

          "content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the turn with A4 offsuit, board is Td 5d 7h Js. I have Ace high with backdoor flush potential (4d gives me a diamond, but board has two diamonds already). Actually, I have 4d, board has Td and 7h, Js, 5d. So there are two diamonds on board (Td, 5d). I have 4d, so I have a flush draw with one more diamond. That's actually a flush draw! Wait, I have 4d, board has Td and 5d. That's three diamonds total. I need two more diamonds for a flush. Actually, a flush requires 5 cards of same suit. I have one diamond, board has two diamonds, so I need two more diamonds on turn and river. That's not a flush draw yet - I need runner-runner diamonds.\n\nBut I also have a gutshot straight draw: board is T-5-7-J. I need a 9 for a straight (8-9-T-J-Q? Wait, let's check: board T-5-7-J. For a straight, I could have 8-9 for a straight? Actually, with A4, possible straights: if a 3 comes, I have A-4-5-? Actually 3 would give me A-2-3-4-5? No, I have A4. Board T-5-7-J. Not many straight possibilities. Maybe if a 6 comes, I'd have 4-5-6-7? That's only 4 cards. Not a straight.\n\nMy hand is weak: Ace high with weak kicker. I have position (BTN) and opponent is in Seat 5 (must be CO or BTN? Actually seats: 1 folded, 2 folded (SB), 3 is me (BB), 4 folded, 5 raised preflop. So opponent is in early position? Actually seat 5 is after me? Wait, seating: 1, 2, 3 (me), 4, 5. So opponent in seat 5 acted after me preflop. That means they raised from late position, maybe CO or BTN? Actually I was BB, so seat 5 is either BTN or CO depending on table size. Anyway, they raised preflop, I called from BB with A4o.\n\nFlop: Td 5d 7h. I checked, they bet 4 into pot of ~13? Let's calculate: preflop pot: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6, I called 4 more. So pot preflop: 1+2+6+4=13? Actually SB folded, so only 1 from SB, 2 from BB, 6 from raiser, 4 from my call = 13. Flop: they bet 4, I called 4, pot now 21.\n\nTurn: Js. No flush yet. I have nothing but Ace high. I'm getting 21:0 odds to check (no bet). I could check and see what opponent does. They might bet again with a wide range since they raised preflop and bet flop. They could have a pair, a draw, or air.\n\nMy stack: 190 chips (95 BB). Opponent has 190 chips. Pot is 21. Not huge.\n\nGiven my weak hand and only Ace high, I should probably check and fold to a bet unless I get good odds. But I have position - I can check and see what they do. If they check behind, I get a free river. If they bet, I need to evaluate.\n\nActually, I have the option to bet as a bluff. But with Ace high on a board with T-5-7-J, there are many draws (flush draw, straight draws). My hand has some showdown value if checked through, but not much.\n\nBetter to check and see what opponent does.

Board has two diamonds, I have 4d giving me a backdoor flush draw (need two more diamonds). Also board T-5-7-J, not much straight potential for my hand. I have position, opponent raised preflop from seat 5 (late position) and bet flop. Turn brought Js, no flush. Pot is 21, no bet to call. I can check, raise, or fold. Folding seems too weak when I can check for free. Raising could be a bluff, but with Ace high and no strong draw, probably not good. Checking seems standard to see what opponent does on river, maybe bluff catch if they check behind or bet small.\n\nBut wait, I have position, I'm last to act. Actually, on turn, opponent acted first? Let's see: preflop: seat 5 raised, I called. Flop: I checked, seat 5 bet, I called. Turn: board shown, now it's my action? Actually, the hand description says \"=== Hand #1 - TURN ===\" and shows board, then \"Amount to call: 0\". That suggests it's my turn to act, and opponent has not acted yet?

Typically, the order would be: after flop, first to act is the player left of the dealer. I'm BTN, so opponent in seat 5 might be first to act? Actually, need to consider positions. Seats: 1, 2, 3 (me BTN), 4, 5. Blinds: seat 2 posted SB, seat 3 (me) posted BB. Preflop: seat 4 folded, seat 5 raised, seat 1 folded, seat 2 folded, I called. So there are two players: me (BB) and seat 5 (raiser). On flop, first to act is the player left of the dealer? Actually, the dealer button is at seat 3 (me). So the small blind (seat 2) would act first, but they folded. So the first to act postflop is the next player after the dealer, which is seat 4, but they folded. Then seat 5, then me. So seat 5 acts first postflop. On flop, I checked, seat 5 bet, I called. On turn, the action should start with seat 5 again. But the interface says \"Amount to call: 0\" and legal actions for me. That suggests it's my turn to act, meaning seat 5 has already acted and checked? Or maybe the interface is showing that it's my turn because I'm the user? Wait, the description might be that the turn card is dealt, and now it's my action because I'm the user and the opponent has not acted yet? Actually, typical poker interface: after turn card, the first player to act is the one left of the dealer. That would be seat 5. But maybe the system is waiting for my action because I'm the user and the opponent's action is simulated after mine? Or maybe the opponent has already checked? The \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests there is no bet to call, meaning opponent has checked. Because if opponent had bet, amount to call would be >0. So opponent must have checked.

But with only 21 pot, and my stack 190, a bluff might work if opponent is weak. However, they might call with any pair. I have some equity if I get called: I have 6 outs to pair my Ace (3 Aces left), maybe 3 outs to pair my 4 (but that's weak). Also backdoor"

I have Ace high with backdoor flush potential (4d gives me a diamond, but board has two diamonds already). Actually, I have 4d, board has Td and 7h, Js, 5d. So there are two diamonds on board (Td, 5d). I have 4d, so I have a flush draw with one more diamond. That's actually a flush draw! Wait, I have 4d, board has Td and 5d. That's three diamonds total. I need two more diamonds for a flush. Actually, a flush requires 5 cards of same suit. I have one diamond, board has two diamonds, so I need two more diamonds on turn and river. That's not a flush draw yet - I need runner-runner diamonds.\n\nBut I also have a gutshot straight draw: board is T-5-7-J. I need a 9 for a straight (8-9-T-J-Q? Wait, let's check: board T-5-7-J. For a straight, I could have 8-9 for a straight? Actually, with A4, possible straights: if a 3 comes, I have A-4-5-? Actually 3 would give me A-2-3-4-5? No, I have A4. Board T-5-7-J. Not many straight possibilities. Maybe if a 6 comes, I'd have 4-5-6-7? That's only 4 cards. Not a straight.\n\nMy hand is weak: Ace high with weak kicker. I have position (BTN) and opponent is in Seat 5 (must be CO or BTN? Actually seats: 1 folded, 2 folded (SB), 3 is me (BB), 4 folded, 5 raised preflop. So opponent is in early position? Actually seat 5 is after me? Wait, seating: 1, 2, 3 (me), 4, 5. So opponent in seat 5 acted after me preflop. That means they raised from late position, maybe CO or BTN? Actually I was BB, so seat 5 is either BTN or CO depending on table size. Anyway, they raised preflop, I called from BB with A4o.\n\nFlop: Td 5d 7h. I checked, they bet 4 into pot of ~13? Let's calculate: preflop pot: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6, I called 4 more. So pot preflop: 1+2+6+4=13? Actually SB folded, so only 1 from SB, 2 from BB, 6 from raiser, 4 from my call = 13. Flop: they bet 4, I called 4, pot now 21.\n\nTurn: Js. No flush yet. I have nothing but Ace high. I'm getting 21:0 odds to check (no bet). I could check and see what opponent does. They might bet again with a wide range since they raised preflop and bet flop. They could have a pair, a draw, or air.\n\nMy stack: 190 chips (95 BB). Opponent has 190 chips. Pot is 21. Not huge.\n\nGiven my weak hand and only Ace high, I should probably check and fold to a bet unless I get good odds. But I have position - I can check and see what they do. If they check behind, I get a free river. If they bet, I need to evaluate.\n\nActually, I have the option to bet as a bluff. But with Ace high on a board with T-5-7-J, there are many draws (flush draw, straight draws). My hand has some showdown value if checked through, but not much.\n\nBetter to check and see what opponent does. If they bet small, maybe I call if I think they're bluffing and I have some equity with Ace high.

Opponent is GPT-OSS-120B with 182 chips.\n\nMy hand: Ace-high with backdoor flush draw (4d gives me a diamond draw, but board has Td 5d 7h Js - so I have 4d and As, so I have one diamond. Actually wait: I have 4d, board has Td, 5d, 7h, Js. So I have a flush draw with 4 diamonds? Let's count: I have 4d, board has Td, 5d - that's three diamonds total. Need two more diamonds for flush. Actually flush requires 5 cards of same suit. I have one diamond, board has two diamonds, so I need two more diamonds on river. That's not a flush draw, just backdoor.\n\nActually: I have 4d (diamond), board has Td (diamond), 5d (diamond) - that's three diamonds. So I have a flush draw needing two more diamonds? Wait, that's wrong: A flush is 5 cards of same suit. I have 1 diamond, board has 2 diamonds = 3 diamonds total. Need 2 more diamonds. But there's only one card to come (river). So I cannot make a flush unless I already have a flush draw with 4 diamonds. I only have 3 diamonds, so not a flush draw.\n\nSo my hand is Ace-high with weak pair potential. I have A4 offsuit. Board is Td 5d 7h Js. I have no pair, no straight draw (need 6-8-9 or something). Actually I have gutshot straight draw? Board T-5-7-J. I have A4. Possible straights: 8-9-T-J-Q for straight, or 9-T-J-Q-K, etc. Not relevant. I have backdoor flush draw with 3 diamonds, but need runner-runner diamonds.\n\nSo essentially I have Ace-high with very little equity. Opponent bet small on flop (4 into 13? Let's calculate: preflop pot was: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6, I called 4 more. So preflop pot = 1+2+6+4 = 13? Actually SB folded, so SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6 (so total 6), I call 4 more (total 10). Wait, let's track: Seat 2 posted SB 1, folded. Seat 3 (me) posted BB 2. Seat 5 raised to 6. I called 4 more. So pot preflop: SB 1 (folded), BB 2, raise 6, call 4 = 13 chips. Yes.\n\nFlop: I check, opponent bets 4 into 13, I call 4. Pot becomes 13+4+4 = 21.\n\nTurn: I check, opponent bets 8 into 21. Pot now 21+8 = 29 if I call. I need to call 8 to win 29, so pot odds 8:29 \u2248 3.6:1, or about 21.6% equity needed.\n\nWhat equity do I have? Against what range? Opponent raised preflop from CO? Actually Seat 5 is CO? Wait positions: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 SB, Seat 3 BB (me), Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 is button? No, I'm button (Seat 3). Actually positions: Seat 1 is UTG? Let's see: Blinds 1/2, Seat 2 posted SB, Seat 3 posted BB, Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 raised. So Seat 5 is CO? Or maybe Seat 5 is UTG?

Hmm.\n\nAnyway, opponent raised preflop from late position. Could have wide range. Bet small on flop (4 into 13), and small on turn (8 into 21). This looks like continuation bet with moderate strength. Could be pair like TT, JJ, maybe AJ, KT, etc. Or could be bluff with overcards.\n\nI need to recall opponent tendencies.

          "reasoning_content": "No history available. This might be early in tournament. Let's analyze based on hand.\n\nMy hand: A4 offsuit. Board Td 5d 7h Js. I have Ace-high, backdoor flush draw (3 diamonds, need runner-runner), no straight draw. Very weak hand.\n\nOpponent's actions: Raised preflop from late position (likely CO or UTG depending on seating). Bet small on flop (4 into 13, ~30% pot). Bet small on turn (8 into 21, ~38% pot). This could be betting for value with medium strength (pair of Jacks, Tens, maybe overpair like QQ-AA, though would likely bet bigger). Could be bluff with missed overcards.\n\nPot odds: Need 8 to call, pot will be 37 after my call? Actually pot is 29 now (21+8), I call 8 makes pot 37. My investment 8 to win 29, so need ~21.6% equity.\n\nWhat equity does A4o have against reasonable range? Let's estimate: Against top 20% hands (77+, A9s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KQo), A4o has about 18% equity on this board. Against tighter range (top 10%: 77+, ATs+, KQs, AJo+), maybe 15%. Against bluff range (any two cards), maybe 30-40%. But opponent likely has something given betting on two streets.\n\nThe small bet sizes suggest opponent doesn't have monster (would bet bigger for value). Could be betting for protection with medium pair (like JJ, TT, 99, 88, maybe 77). Board has Td 5d 7h Js. Possible sets: TT, 55, 77, JJ. But would likely bet bigger. Could have two pair: JT, T7, J5, etc.\n\nMy Ace-high is likely not good. I have 3 outs to pair Ace (3 Aces left), but need to discount because opponent might have AJ, AT, etc. So maybe 1.5 outs. Backdoor flush needs runner-runner diamonds: probability ~4.5%. So total equity maybe ~10%.\n\nPot odds require 21.6%. So fold unless I think opponent bluffing frequently.\n\nBut I have position (button). Calling allows me to see river and potentially bluff if diamond comes or Ace comes. However, my stack is 190, opponent 182. Pot is small relative to stacks.\n\nTournament considerations: early stage, preserve stack. This is a marginal spot. I think folding is correct. The small bet sizing could be inducing calls, but I have very little equity.\n\nLet's consider if I raise as bluff. Could represent strong hand like flush draw, straight draw, two pair. But opponent has shown strength by betting two streets. Raising would be risky with Ace-high. Minimum raise to 16 (total). That's 16 to call for opponent into pot of 29+16=45? Actually if I raise to 16 total (I put 16, opponent put 8 already, so additional 8 for me). Pot would be 29+8=37, opponent needs to call 8 more. So pot odds for opponent 8:37 \u2248 4.6:1. They'll call with any decent hand. Bluff likely fails.\n\nBetter to fold. I'll fold.\n\nResponse JSON: {\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A4o with Ace-high on Td 5d 7h Js board has minimal equity (~10%).

The hand is terrible, position is terrible, and we have plenty of chips to wait for better spots. Even if we flop a pair, we're likely dominated or facing overcards.

Likely playing tight.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has raised preflop in both previous hands (to 6 and 8 chips). Shows aggressive tendencies. Also continued betting on flop and turn in both hands.\n\n**Position Advantage:**\nBeing on the button is a huge advantage. I act last postflop, which gives me maximum information and control.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n2c 4s is a terrible hand. Even on the button, it's borderline unplayable. The only redeeming quality is being suited, but 2-4 offsuit would be worse.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack (94.5 BB). No need to take unnecessary risks with trash hands.\n\n**Potential Play:**\nWith position and both blinds having shown tendencies (SB tight, BB aggressive), I could consider a steal attempt. However:\n1. My hand has almost no postflop playability\n2. BB has shown aggression and might defend or 3-bet\n3. Even if I steal successfully, I only win 3 chips\n4. If I get called or raised, I'm playing a very weak hand out of position relative to the caller\n\nThe risk/reward isn't good. 2-4 suited is a hand I might consider limping with in some very specific multi-way pot situations, but not for a steal attempt from the button against an aggressive BB.\n\n**Decision:**\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. My stack is healthy, and I don't need to gamble with 2-4 suited.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2c4s is too weak even on the button against an aggressive BB who has raised both previous hands.

I shouldn't be playing K2o from UTG. I need to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations: I have 94.5 BB, so no pressure to play marginal hands. The tournament is still early.

It has good implied odds if we hit a set (flop a 6). Preflop, it's ahead of many unpaired hands but vulnerable to overcards.\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is excellent - we get to act last on every street postflop.\n3. **Opponent Tendencies:** From the recall, GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop in both previous hands I saw (Hand #1 and Hand #2). This suggests they might be raising with a wide range, not just premium hands.\n4. **Pot Odds:** Pot is currently 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). We need to call 4 to win 9, giving us 2.25:1 pot odds (31% equity needed). Pocket sixes vs a typical raising range has around 40%+ equity.\n5. **Tournament Considerations:** We have a healthy stack (93.5 BB). Calling 4 chips (2 BB) is only 2.1% of our stack - very small risk.\n6. **Implied Odds:** If we hit a set (about 1 in 8.5 chance), we could win a big pot. Being in position helps us maximize value.\n7. **Alternatives:** We could raise, but with a medium pocket pair, we're often either flipping or dominated. Calling to see a flop and play in position is usually better.\n\n**Decision:** Call. The small investment relative to our stack, good position, and decent implied odds make this a profitable call. Folding would be too tight given the odds and position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket sixes in position with good pot odds (4 to win 9).

Now on the flop, I'm first to act since the preflop raiser is last to act.\n\nMy hand: 6h 6d. I have a pocket pair but the board shows JJ7. I have a set possibility if a 6 comes, but currently I'm behind any jack or any pocket pair higher than 6s. The board is paired with jacks, which reduces the chance opponent has a jack (only 2 left in deck).\n\nOpponent GPT-OSS-120B raised preflop from late position (seat 5). From the recall, they've been aggressive - raising preflop in hands 1 and 2, and betting on flop and turn in those hands. They seem to be continuation betting frequently.\n\nThe pot is 13 chips. I have 183 chips (91.5 BB). Opponent has 228 chips.\n\nI'm in position (button) which is good. With a paired board, my pocket 6s might actually be good here if opponent doesn't have a jack. They could have a wide range from late position: many pocket pairs, suited connectors, broadway cards.\n\nGiven the paired board, I should check and see what opponent does. If they bet, I can call with a small bet sizing given pot odds. The minimum raise is 4 chips, but raising doesn't make much sense here with a medium-strength hand on a paired board.\n\nI should check and let opponent act. If they check behind, I get a free card. If they bet small, I can call. If they bet big, I might fold.\n\nLet me check.",

Being in position helps.\n\n**Decision**: I should call. Reasons:\n1. Decent pot odds (27.6% equity needed)\n2. Position advantage\n3. Opponent could be betting with draws or overcards\n4.

Our hand is essentially a bluff catcher at this point. The board is Js Jh 7h 2s - very dry except for the flush draw. Our sixes give us a very weak hand - we're basically hoping opponent is bluffing or has a worse pocket pair.\n\n**Opponent analysis (from recall):**\nGPT-OSS-120B has been aggressive:\n- Hand #1: raised preflop, bet flop, bet turn\n- Hand #2: raised preflop, bet flop, bet turn, checked river\n- Recent hands: folded preflop twice (hands 4 & 5)\n\nThis opponent seems to be continuation betting frequently and showing aggression on multiple streets. They checked river in hand #2 after betting flop and turn.\n\n**Position:** We're on the button (BTN), which is good.\n\n**Pot odds:** Currently we can check for free. If we check and opponent bets on river, we'd need to evaluate pot odds then.\n\n**Our options:**\n1. **Check:** See a free river. This is the most conservative play. Given our weak hand and the paired board, we're likely behind unless opponent is bluffing.\n2. **Raise:** Could represent a Jack or a strong hand. However, with the board paired, raising might be risky as we could be up against trips or better. Also, we'd be bluffing with little equity.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** We have 87.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Decision:** I think checking is best. We have a marginal hand that could improve to a full house on the river (if a 6 comes), but more likely we're just hoping to catch a bluff. Checking keeps the pot small and allows us to evaluate the river. If opponent bets big on river, we can likely fold unless we improve.\n\nGiven the paired board and our weak hand relative to possible holdings (Jx, overpairs, 7x, etc.), checking seems optimal. We're getting a free card with some implied odds if we hit a 6."

Our sixes give us a very weak hand - we're basically hoping opponent is bluffing or has a worse pocket pair.\n\n**Opponent analysis (from recall):**\nGPT-OSS-120B has been aggressive:\n- Hand #1: raised preflop, bet flop, bet turn\n- Hand #2: raised preflop, bet flop, bet turn, checked river\n- Recent hands: folded preflop twice (hands 4 & 5)\n\nThis opponent seems to be continuation betting frequently and showing aggression on multiple streets. They checked river in hand #2 after betting flop and turn.\n\n**Position:** We're on the button (BTN), which is good.\n\n**Pot odds:** Currently we can check for free. If we check and opponent bets on river, we'd need to evaluate pot odds then.\n\n**Our options:**\n1. **Check:** See a free river. This is the most conservative play. Given our weak hand and the paired board, we're likely behind unless opponent is bluffing.\n2. **Raise:** Could represent a Jack or a strong hand. However, with the board paired, raising might be risky as we could be up against trips or better. Also, we'd be bluffing with little equity.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** We have 87.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Decision:** I think checking is best. We have a marginal hand that could improve to a full house on the river (if a 6 comes), but more likely we're just hoping to catch a bluff. Checking keeps the pot small and allows us to evaluate the river. If opponent bets big on river, we can likely fold unless we improve.\n\nGiven the paired board and our weak hand relative to possible holdings (Jx, overpairs, 7x, etc.), checking seems optimal. We're getting a free card with some implied odds if we hit a 6.",

With only 4.6% of stack at risk, calling to see river is reasonable given opponent's history of multi-street betting but checking river with marginal hands in past.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I have information about GPT-OSS-120B's betting patterns. Looking at the history:\n- Hand #1: They raised preflop 6, bet flop 4, bet turn 8\n- Hand #2: They raised preflop 8, bet flop 6, bet turn 6, checked river\n- This hand: They raised preflop 6, bet flop 8, bet turn 8\n\nSo GPT-OSS-120B seems to be a consistent bettor across streets when they have initiative. They've shown willingness to bet multiple streets.\n\nNow, let me analyze my current situation:\n\nBoard: Js Jh 7h 2s\nMy hand: 6h 6d\nPot: 37 chips\nAmount to call: 8 chips\nMy stack: 175 chips (87.5 BB)\n\nMy hand is pocket sixes on a paired board with J-J-7-2. The board has two hearts (Js, 7h) but no flush yet. My sixes are likely not good here unless opponent is bluffing or has a worse pocket pair. The board is paired with Jacks, so anyone with a Jack has trips. There are straight draws possible (8-9-T or 9-T-Q) but less likely.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 45 (37 + 8). That's about 5.6:1 odds, or I need ~15% equity.\n\nWhat could opponent have? They raised preflop from seat 5 (cutoff), so their range includes: broadway cards, pocket pairs, suited connectors. They've bet flop and turn with smallish bets (8 each time, about 1/4 pot on flop, 1/4 pot on turn). This could be continuation betting with a wide range or value betting with a strong hand.\n\nMy sixes are likely behind against most value hands: AJ, KJ, QJ, TJ, any Jack, maybe pocket 7s for a full house, pocket 2s for a full house. I'm only beating pure bluffs or smaller pocket pairs (5s or lower).\n\nHowever, the small bet sizes suggest they might be betting for thin value or continuation. If they had trips or better, they might bet larger for value. But they could also be betting small to keep me in with a worse hand.\n\nGiven my position (BTN), I called preflop out of position, which is already questionable with 66. I've called flop and now turn. I'm getting decent pot odds (5.6:1). If I think I have at least 15% equity, I should call.\n\nWhat's my equity? Against a range of: JJ-AA, AJs+, KJs+, QJs, JTs, 77-99, I have about 18% equity. Against a tighter range of just trips+ (any J, 77, 22), I have about 8% equity. Against a bluff-heavy range, I could have 50%+ equity.\n\nThe opponent's history shows they bet multiple streets but also checked river in hand #2 when they had been betting. Could be they slow down with marginal hands.\n\nI have 175 chips, calling 8 is only 4.6% of my stack. The pot is 37, so I'm getting good odds. Even if I'm behind, I have implied odds if I hit a six on river (2 outs, ~4% chance). But that's not great.\n\nGiven the small bet size and decent pot odds, I think I should call and see river. If opponent checks river, I can check behind. If they bet river, I can fold unless I improve.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. I'm in a tournament, but stack sizes are healthy. Folding here preserves 8 chips but gives up pot. Calling keeps me in the hand with a chance to win if opponent is bluffing or has a worse hand.\n\nI'll call.",

Opponent is GPT-OSS-120B with 212 chips.\n\nThe hand history: preflop, GPT-OSS-120B raised to 6 from early position (seat 5), I called from BB with 66. Flop: Js Jh 7h, I checked, opponent bet 8, I called. Turn: 2s, I checked, opponent bet 8, I called. River: 5s, completing the board: Js Jh 7h 2s 5s.\n\nNow on river, I have 66, board has JJ with 7,2,5. My hand is essentially a bluff catcher - I beat only pure bluffs. Any J, any 7, any pocket pair higher than 6s, any flush (board has 3 spades), any straight (possible 8-9, 9-T, but board is J-J-7-2-5, so straights would be 8-9-T-J or 3-4-5-6-7? Actually 5-6-7-8-9 would be a straight, but I have 66, so 6 is part of that straight. Wait: board is J-J-7-2-5. Possible straights: 3-4-5-6-7 (using 5,6,7, plus 3,4) - but I have 66, so I have a 6, but need 3 and 4. That's unlikely. 5-6-7-8-9: need 8 and 9. Also unlikely. So straights are very unlikely.\n\nThe flush possibility: board has Js, 2s, 5s - three spades. Opponent could have a flush if they have two spades. The flush draw got there on river with 5s. So flush is possible.\n\nMy hand: pocket 6s, no spade. I have 6h 6d. So I'm losing to any J, any flush, any higher pocket pair (77+, though 77 is unlikely because board has a J and 7, but possible). Also any 7 (like A7, K7, etc) beats me because they have a pair of 7s with J kicker. Actually board has JJ, so any pair higher than 6 would be two pair: JJ + that pair. So 77, 22, 55 would be full house. Actually 77 would be full house (JJJ + 77). 22 would be full house. 55 would be full house. But those are unlikely.\n\nOpponent's range: They raised preflop from seat 5 (which is UTG? Actually seats: 1 folded, 2 folded, 3 is me (BTN/BB), 4 folded, 5 is UTG? Let's see: positions: Seat 1 is UTG? Actually typical 5-max: seat 1 UTG, seat 2 MP, seat 3 CO, seat 4 BTN, seat 5 SB? Wait blinds: Seat 2 posted SB, Seat 3 posted BB. So seat 5 is actually the button? No, I'm seat 3 (BTN) but posted BB because of blind positions. Let's reconstruct: Blinds are 1/2. Seat 2 posted SB 1, Seat 3 (me) posted BB 2. Then action: Seat 4 fold, Seat 5 raise 6. Seat 1 fold, Seat 2 fold, Seat 3 call. So Seat 5 is UTG (first to act after blinds). So they raised from UTG. That suggests a stronger range.\n\nThey bet flop and turn small: 8 into pot of ~? Preflop pot: 6 (raise) + 2 (BB) + 1 (SB) = 9? Actually SB posted 1, BB posted 2, UTG raised to 6 total. So pot preflop: 1+2+6 = 9. I called additional 4 (to match 6). So pot after preflop: 9+4 = 13? Wait: SB folded, so only UTG and me. Pot: SB 1 + BB 2 + UTG 6 = 9. I called additional 4 (to match 6). So pot = 9+4 = 13. Flop: I check, UTG bet 8 into 13. That's ~60% pot. I call. Pot becomes 13+8+8 = 29. Turn: I"

If they have flush, they'd call. If they have weak hand, they might fold. But they've been betting aggressively (bet flop and turn). That suggests they have a decent hand. However, they might be bluffing with weak hand. But they bet 8 on flop and turn, which is moderate. Could be a middling hand.\n\nGiven I have 66, board has JJ with 7,2,5. Opponent's hand could be something like a flush (spade flush), or a pair like 77, 22, 55, or a J (like AJ, KJ), or a straight (unlikely). Many possibilities beat 66. Only hands that lose to 66 are pure bluffs: no pair, no flush, no straight, no J. But they might have a pair lower than 6 (like 44, 33) but board has 2 and 5, so 22 and 55 are possible but those are full house (JJ + 22). Actually 22 would be full house, which beats 66. So any pair with board cards gives full house, which beats 66. So opponent needs no pair, no J, no flush, no straight. That's relatively rare.\n\nThus p (fold probability) is low. Likely <15%. So raising is -EV.\n\nBetter to check (fold). Actually check means I'm not raising, just passing. But I can check (no raise) and then opponent can check or raise? Wait, amount to call is 0, so I can check (do nothing). If I check, opponent can raise or check. If opponent raises, I can call or fold. But if opponent raises, I'll have to decide to call or fold. That's better because I get to see opponent's action before committing. However, if I check and opponent checks, showdown occurs and I likely lose. If opponent raises, I can then decide to call or fold based on raise amount.\n\nBut checking might allow opponent to raise, which could be a bluff if they have weak hand. But they might raise small to try to steal. However, they have been betting 8 each street, so maybe they'll raise 8 again. If they raise 8, I can call (if I think I'm beat) or fold. If I fold, I lose 0 chips. If I call, I lose 8 chips. So better to fold if they raise.\n\nThus checking is safer: I can see opponent's raise amount, then decide to fold if they raise (or call if I think I might win). But if they check, I lose showdown but lose 0 extra.\n\nThus check seems best.\n\nLet's consider tournament: I have 167 chips, good stack. No need to risk chips.\n\nI'll check.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 66 is weak vs board with JJ and possible flush.

This is the river street - final decision point\n2. Opponent (Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B) has bet 45 chips\n3. From recall: Seat 5 has been playing aggressively in previous hands (betting at each street)\n4. I have a pair of sixes - not a great hand but not terrible either\n5.

Board has Js Jh (pair) which might mean opponent has a jack or is bluffing. My 6h matches the heart suit on board (7h, Jh), which could be relevant.\n\n**Tournament consideration**: I have 167 chips, which is decent. I've folded all hands so far, so I need to start accumulating chips. However, losing 45 chips on a bad call hurts my stack.\n\n**Opponent behavior**: Seat 5 has been betting consistently in previous hands (not folding much). In hand #2, they checked on river, suggesting they might be more conservative at river when they have weak hands.\n\nGiven this is river and opponent bet 45 (half pot), this could be a bluff or a legitimate bet. With a pair of sixes, I have some strength. The pot odds are favorable (2:1) for calling.\n\nHowever, I should consider: if I fold, I lose nothing but gain nothing. If I call and win, I gain 90 chips. If I call and lose, I lose 45 chips.\n\nMy pair of sixes is decent but not strong. The opponent might be betting because they have a jack or better hand. But they could also be bluffing.\n\nGiven I need to start accumulating chips in the tournament and the pot odds are favorable, I should probably call.

My stack is 121 chips (60.5 BB), so this call would be about 4% of my stack.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations. With 60BB, I have a decent stack, but 72o is just awful. The raiser is in early position (Seat 2 looks like UTG or UTG+1). A raise from early position suggests a strong range.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 5 to win 9 (current pot) + 5 (my call) = 14, so I'm getting 5:9 pot odds, or about 1.8:1. I need about 35% equity to call. 72o has maybe 15-20% equity against a typical early position raising range.\n\nAlso, I'm out of position (in SB) which makes playing this hand even worse. I should fold.\n\nBut let me check if there's any history on this opponent. The search didn't find anything, so I don't have reads.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI'm on the button with A8o. The blinds are 1/2, and my stack is 121 chips (60.5 BB). The small blind (MiniMax-M2) and big blind (GPT-OSS-120B) are yet to act after me.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has folded 7 out of 8 times preflop, only called once in hand #4. Very tight player.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has shown some aggression - raised in hand #6 preflop to 6, and bet on multiple streets. Has folded 3 times preflop.\n\nMy hand: A8o is a marginal hand. Ace-high with weak kicker. On the button, this is a reasonable steal candidate against tight blinds.\n\nPosition: Being on the button is a huge advantage - I get to act last postflop.\n\nStack sizes: I have 60.5 BB, which is healthy but not huge. SB has 96 BB, BB has 150 BB.\n\nTournament considerations: I haven't won a hand yet (0 wins, 6 folds, 1 loss). I need to accumulate chips. The blinds will come around again soon.\n\nGiven the tight tendencies of the SB (folds 87.5% of the time preflop) and the BB's mixed but not overly aggressive profile, raising from the button with A8o could be profitable. Even if called, I have position and an Ace which dominates some weaker Ax hands.\n\nHowever, A8o is not a great hand for calling. If I just call 2 chips, I'll be playing a multi-way pot out of position against the blinds, which is not ideal. Better to either raise or fold.\n\nPot odds: It's 2 chips to call into a 3 chip pot (1.5:1 odds), but position matters more.\n\nI think the best play is to raise to 6 chips total (4 more). This is a standard button raise that puts pressure on the blinds. If they fold, I win 3 chips. If called, I have position.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations... The minimum raise is to 4 total, but raising to 6 (3x BB) is standard.\n\nDecision: Raise to 6.",

There's also a backdoor flush draw with diamonds on board, but I don't have a diamond. My hand has very little showdown value currently - just Ace-high.\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\nGPT-OSS-120B seems to be an aggressive player. Looking at their actions:\n- Hand #2: Bet flop, bet turn, check river\n- Hand #6: Raised preflop, bet flop, bet turn, bet river (big bet of 45)\nThey appear to be continuation betting frequently and applying pressure.\n\n**Board analysis:**\nThe board is Q\u2666 J\u2666 3\u2665 9\u2660. This is a fairly wet board with straight and flush draws. My opponent checked the turn after checking the flop. Given their aggressive tendencies, this check might indicate weakness or a slow play.\n\n**Position:**\nI have position on the opponent (they act before me on each street).\n\n**Stack sizes:**\nI have 115 chips, opponent has 296. Pot is 13. A bet of 6-8 chips would be reasonable.\n\n**Decision considerations:**\n1. **Check:** Take a free card. My hand needs improvement. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to see a river card cheaply.\n2. **Bet:** Try to take down the pot now with a bluff. Given opponent's check on both flop and turn, they might be weak. A bet could win the pot immediately.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I'm at 57.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take excessive risks.\n\n**Pot odds:** If I bet, I need fold equity to justify it.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have position\n- Opponent checked twice (flop and turn)\n- Opponent is generally aggressive but showing weakness here\n- I have some draw equity (gutshot to straight)\n- My hand has minimal showdown value\n\nI think a small bet could be profitable. If I bet 6 chips (half pot), I need the opponent to fold about 30% of the time to be profitable. Given their check-check line, they might fold many hands that missed this board.\n\nHowever, checking is also reasonable to see a free river card. But if I check, I give up any chance to win the pot immediately, and I'll likely have to fold to any river bet if I don't improve.\n\nGiven my aggressive image from raising preflop, a continuation bet here could work well. I'll make a small bet to apply pressure."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nWe're in the BB with 6s 8c - a very weak hand (off-suit, low cards, no connectors). Our stack is 126 chips (63 BB).\n\nAction: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8 from late position, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called, then Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) re-raised to 24 total.\n\nWe need to call 22 more chips to continue. The pot is currently 42 chips (blinds 1+2 + raise 8 + call 8 + re-raise 24? Actually let me calculate: blinds 1+2=3, plus Seat 5's 8 = 11, plus Seat 1's call 8 = 19, plus Seat 2's re-raise to 24 total means they put in 23 more (since they already had 1 SB), so pot is 3+8+8+23=42 chips).\n\nWe have to call 22 into a pot of 42, giving us pot odds of roughly 1.9:1 (22 to win 64 total if we call). That's about 34% equity needed.\n\nWith 6s 8c, we have a terrible hand preflop. Even against a wide range, we have maybe 30-35% equity at best. But we're likely facing strong hands here:\n\n1. Seat 5 raised from late position (could be wide)\n2. Seat 1 called (could be medium strength)\n3. Seat 2 re-raised from SB position - this is likely very strong. Looking at their history: in hand #7 they raised preflop to 6, and in hand #10 they called. They seem somewhat active but not hyper-aggressive.\n\nAdditionally, Seat 1 still has to act after us, and they've already called the initial raise. They might call or re-raise again.\n\nOur hand has very little playability postflop. 6-8 offsuit doesn't flop well - we need two pair or better to feel comfortable, and even then we're vulnerable to overcards.\n\nStack preservation is important: we have 63 BB, which is healthy but not huge. Losing 22 chips (17% of our stack) with a weak hand in a multi-way pot with a re-raiser is dangerous.\n\nTournament considerations: We should avoid marginal spots with weak hands, especially when facing aggression.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown some aggression preflop but not excessive\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has raised preflop before and shown down decent hands (TJ, AJ)\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) called a raise, so likely has a playable hand\n\nThe re-raise from Seat 2 suggests a strong hand, possibly QQ+, AK, maybe JJ/TT. We're dominated by almost all of those.\n\nEven if we flop a pair, we'll be playing out of position with a weak kicker against likely strong ranges.\n\nThe pot odds are borderline, but implied odds are poor because we're out of position and our hand is weak. Reverse implied odds are high - we could easily lose a lot if we hit a marginal hand.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. We have plenty of chips to be patient.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Better to preserve our 125-chip stack and wait for a better spot.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the small blind with 4d7c, a very weak hand. My stack is 125 chips (62.5 BB). The opponent Kimi-K2 in seat 2 raised to 6 (3x BB). I need to call 5 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is currently 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise).\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: Kimi-K2 has raised preflop twice before (hand 7 and hand 11). In hand 7 they raised to 6, same as now. In hand 11 they raised to 24 (much larger). They've folded preflop 3 times, called once. So they seem somewhat active but not overly aggressive.\n\nWith 4d7c offsuit, this is a bottom-tier hand. Even from the small blind, calling with such a weak hand is generally not good. The pot odds: I need to call 5 to win 9, which is about 1.8:1 odds or 35.7% equity needed. 4d7c has about 30-35% equity against a typical raising range, but that's against random cards. Against a real raising range, it's worse.\n\nPosition is bad - I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand. Stack preservation is important in tournaments. My stack is 125 chips, which is healthy but not huge. Calling 5 chips (4% of my stack) isn't terrible, but I'll be playing a weak hand out of position.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. The small blind is a tough position, but with such a weak hand, folding is correct. I could consider a raise as a bluff, but with 4d7c it's too weak even for that, and I'd be risking too much.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. The big blind (MiniMax-M2) is still to act behind me if I call. They could squeeze. So folding seems best.\n\nDecision: fold.",

I won one hand from the button with A8o. My opponents don't seem overly aggressive based on limited data.\n\nThe most prudent play is to fold this weak hand.

Folding too tight given stack depth. Raise aims to take initiative and avoid playing marginal hand out of position against multiple opponents.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I have pocket 8s from UTG position with 125 chips (62.5 BB). Blinds are 1/2. Seat 5 posted SB, Seat 1 posted BB, Seat 2 folded. I'm first to act.\n\nLooking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot (11 folds in 13 hands, only 1 win). My stack is 125 chips, which is middle of the pack - Seat 5 has 302, Seat 1 has 182, Seat 4 has 179.\n\nPocket 8s is a medium pair. From UTG, it's borderline. In tournament poker, medium pairs can be tricky from early position because if someone raises behind, I'll have to fold or play a marginal hand out of position.\n\nLooking at opponent raising tendencies: GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has raised preflop multiple times (hands 2, 6, 10, 11). They seem aggressive. Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has also raised preflop (hands 7, 11, 12). MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) hasn't shown preflop raises but did raise on flop once.\n\nGiven my UTG position and the aggressive players behind me (especially Seat 5 who has raised 4 times preflop), calling with 88 could be problematic. If I call, players behind might raise, putting me in a tough spot. Raising might be better to define my hand, but raising from UTG with 88 is also risky.\n\nConsidering my stack size (62.5 BB), I have room to play. But tournament considerations: I need to preserve chips and pick better spots. 88 from UTG is marginal.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips (after my call, pot would be 5). That's 2:5 or 40% pot odds, which is too high for 88 to need to win. But implied odds if I hit a set could be good.\n\nHowever, with aggressive players behind, I might face a raise and have to fold, wasting 2 chips. Or I could raise to 4-6 chips to try to take it down or play heads-up.\n\nActually, looking at the table dynamics, Seat 5 (SB) and Seat 1 (BB) are yet to act after me. Seat 5 has been aggressive but is in SB position. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) act after me.\n\nGiven all this, I think the best play is to raise. A small raise to 4-6 chips might get folds from marginal hands. If I get called or raised, I can reassess on the flop. Folding seems too tight for 88 with 62.5 BB. Calling invites trouble.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips (3x BB). This is a standard raise size. Let's see.",

This is an extremely weak hand - 9-2 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. I have 128 chips (64 BB), which is a decent stack but not huge.\n\nLooking at the table dynamics from the opponent actions I recalled:\n- Hand #12: Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raised to 6 from BB\n- Other players have mostly been folding preflop\n- My own hand history shows I've been folding a lot, but won hand #14 with pocket 8s from CO position\n\nBeing in UTG with 9-2 offsuit, this is an easy fold. The reasons:\n1. UTG is the worst position to play from - I'll have to act first on every street\n2. 9-2 offsuit has very little potential to make strong hands\n3. There are 4 players left to act behind me who could raise\n4. Even if I just call the BB, I'm playing a weak hand out of position with poor odds\n5. Tournament considerations: I need to preserve my stack for better spots\n\nThe pot is only 3 chips (SB + BB), and I'd need to put in 2 chips to call. That's not good pot odds for such a weak hand. Even if no one raises, I'd be playing 9-2 offsuit from early position, which is a recipe for losing chips.\n\nBetter to wait for a better hand in better position. My stack of 64 BB gives me plenty of time to find a better spot.",

This is a weak hand preflop, especially from the SB.\n\n2. **Position**: SB (worst position postflop). Will be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\n3. **Stack**: 126 chips (63 BB). Decent stack but not huge.\n\n4. **Action so far**: SB (Seat 2) posted SB 1, I posted BB 2, MiniMax-M2 called 2, GPT-OSS-120B folded, Kimi-K2 Thinking folded, and Kimi-K2 (SB) called the additional 1. So the action is on me in the BB with 0 to call.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Kimi-K2 (SB) has raised twice in 5 hands (hands 11 and 12) but folded last 3 hands. Seems somewhat active.\n   - MiniMax-M2 has folded all 5 hands preflop - very tight player.\n   - Both opponents seem to be playing fairly tight recently.\n\n6. **Pot**: 6 chips currently (SB 1 + BB 2 + MiniMax call 2 + Kimi-K2 call 1).\n\n7. **My options**: \n   - Check: See a free flop with weak suited hand\n   - Raise: Try to take down the pot now\n   - Fold: Not an option since it's free\n\nWith 4d Td suited, checking to see a free flop is the best play. This hand has some potential if we hit a flush draw or straight draw, but it's too weak to raise from out of position. Raising would be spewy with this hand against two opponents. Checking gives us a free look at the flop with a hand that can make strong draws.\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 has been folding every hand, there's a chance they might fold to a raise, but Kimi-K2 already called from SB and might defend. Better to take the free flop.\n\nI'll check.",

I have bottom pair essentially, but I do have a backdoor flush draw with diamonds (I have 4d Td, board has 5h Tc Kh - no diamonds on board yet). So I have middle pair weak kicker and backdoor flush draw.\n\nI'm first to act on the flop after Seat 2 checked. Pot is 6 chips. I can check or raise. Folding is an option but seems weak given I have a pair.\n\nLet me think about opponents. Seat 2 is Kimi-K2 (not the thinking version), Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2. Both called preflop. They could have various hands: suited connectors, small pairs, broadway cards. The king on board might hit some of their hands.\n\nI should check to see what happens. If I check, Seat 4 gets to act. He might bet if he has a king or a draw. I could then call if the bet is small, or fold if large. Raising could be an option as a semi-bluff or for protection, but with middle pair weak kicker, I'm not that strong. If I raise and get called, I'm likely behind or dominated.\n\nBetter to check and see the action. If checked around, I get a free turn card.

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the SB with 4d Td. The board is 5h Tc Kh. I have middle pair with Ten, but it's a weak kicker (4). The board has a King and a Ten, so there are higher cards out there.\n\nPot is 14 chips, and I need to call 4 chips. That's about 3.5:1 pot odds. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) bet 4, and Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been very tight, folding most hands preflop. In hand #9, they called preflop, then raised on flop to 8, then folded. So they're capable of betting/raising postflop but also folding to aggression.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has shown some aggression (raised preflop in hands 11 and 12) but also calls.\n\nMy hand: I have middle pair with weak kicker. The board is K T 5 rainbow (hearts, clubs? Actually 5h Tc Kh - so hearts and clubs). I have bottom pair with a 4 kicker. Actually wait, I have Td, board has Tc, so I have a pair of Tens. But there's a King on board, so anyone with a King beats me. Also straight draws possible (QJ, 98, etc.).\n\nPosition: I'm in SB, so will be out of position for rest of hand. That's a disadvantage.\n\nStack sizes: I have 126 chips (63 BB). Seat 4 has 173, Seat 2 has 201.\n\nThe bet is small - 4 into 14 pot. Could be a probe bet with a draw or weak hand. Seat 2 called, which suggests they have something like a Ten with better kicker, a draw, or maybe a weak King.\n\nGiven my weak kicker and being out of position, calling seems marginal. However, I do have a pair, and the pot odds are decent (3.5:1). If I improve to two pair or trips on turn, I could win more.\n\nBut there's risk: if I call and turn brings an Ace, Queen, Jack, or another King, I could be in trouble. Also, if I'm already behind to a King, I'm drawing to 2 outs (two remaining Tens).\n\nAlternative: I could raise to try to take it down now. A raise to 8-12 might get folds. But if called, I'm committing more chips with a marginal hand.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: I have 63 BB, which is healthy but not huge. I should preserve chips.\n\nLet me think about implied odds: If I hit trips on turn, I could win a big pot. But I'm out of position, which makes extracting value harder.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: I have 4d Td. Board is 5h Tc Kh. I have middle pair, Ten with 4 kicker. The board has a King, which is concerning. The bettor (Seat 4) has been tight preflop but showed aggression postflop in one hand. Could be betting with a King, a draw, or a weaker Ten.\n\nThe caller (Seat 2) likely has something like a Ten with better kicker, a draw, or maybe a weak King.\n\nIf I fold, I lose nothing more. If I call, I invest 4 chips (3% of my stack) with 3.5:1 odds. That's mathematically okay if I have ~22% equity or more.\n\nWhat's my equity? Against a range of top pair (Kx), other Tens, and draws, I probably have around 25-35% equity. So pot odds justify a call.\n\nBut position is bad. And if I call, I'll face turn betting possibly.\n\nI could consider raising to 12-16 to try to win now. If they fold, I win 18 pot (14 + 4). Risking 12 to win 18 is okay if they fold often.\n\nGiven Seat 4's tightness and previous fold to aggression in hand #9, a raise might work. Seat 2 called a bet but might fold to a raise.\n\nBut if they call or re-raise, I'm in trouble.\n\nGiven my stack size and tournament, I think calling is reasonable. Folding is also okay. Raising is aggressive.\n\nI'll call and see turn. If I improve, I can continue. If not, I can fold to further betting. The investment is small (4 chips).\n\nLet me check if there are any flush draws: I have diamonds, board has hearts and clubs. No flush draw for me.\n\nActually, wait: I have 4d Td, board 5h Tc Kh. No flush draws possible yet"

The board shows 5h Tc Kh Ad.

They bet 4 on the flop this hand.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has shown some aggression with raises preflop (hands 11, 12), but checked flop and turn this hand.

Their flop bet of 4 into ~6 pot is small. Could be testing with weak hand, could have hit something like a pair, or could have a draw.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Checked flop and turn. Called flop bet. Could have a weak pair, draw, or speculative hand.\n\n**My Hand's Prospects:**\n- I have bottom pair with weak kicker\n- The Ace on turn is scary - could have hit many hands\n- I'm vulnerable to any king, ace, or better ten\n- If Seat 4 bets again, I'll likely need to fold\n- If checked through, I might see a free river\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 122 chips (61 BB) - decent stack\n- Pot is only 18 chips\n- Risk vs reward: Not much to gain, significant risk\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven my weak hand, the scary Ace on turn, and the fact that Seat 4 could still bet behind me, checking is the prudent play.

Small bet sizing suggests either weak value or draw. From history, they folded preflop many times but in Hand #9 they called preflop, raised flop to 8, then folded. Seems somewhat cautious.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Called flop bet, checked turn, called turn bet. Could have a draw or weak hand.\n\n**My Hand Strength:**\n- I have middle pair, but board has A, K, T, 5\n- Many better hands beat me: any A, K, two pair, sets, straights\n- My kicker is terrible (4)\n- I have backdoor flush potential (diamonds) but only one diamond on board\n- I'm basically playing for trips or two pair improvement\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 61 BB, which is healthy but not huge\n- Calling 4 chips into 30 is reasonable pot odds\n- However, I could be drawing thin if behind\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Pot odds good (13.3% equity needed)\n2. Hand is marginal but has some showdown value\n3. Opponents' small bets suggest weakness\n4. I could improve to trips or two pair on river\n5. Position is poor (SB) but will act first on river\n\nGiven the small bet size and decent pot odds, I think a call is reasonable. Folding seems too tight for the price. Raising doesn't make sense with such a marginal hand.\n\nI'll call and see the river.",

          "content": "Let me analyze the current situation. I'm in the SB with 4d Td. Board is 5h Tc Kh Ad 6c. I have a pair of tens with a 4 kicker. This is a relatively weak hand. The board shows Ace high, King, Ten, 6, 5. There are no flushes possible (all different suits). Possible straights: QJ would make a straight (but not on board), 7-8 would make a straight, 9-J would make a straight.\n\nMy hand: pair of tens. I'm beating bluffs, but losing to any Ace, King, two pair, sets, straights.\n\nPot is 30 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) checked. I can check or raise. If I check, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) will act. He's been betting small amounts (4 chips) on flop and turn. He might bet again on river.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from search results:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop several times (hands 7, 11, 12). Seems aggressive preflop. In this hand, he just called preflop, checked flop, called bet, checked turn, called bet, checked river. This seems like a weak line - maybe a draw that missed or a weak pair.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): From hand 9, he raised on flop with 2d 6d on board 5h Js Jh when facing a bet, then folded to a re-raise. Seems capable of aggression but also folds to pressure. In this hand, he limped preflop, bet 4 on flop, bet 4 on turn. Small bets could be probing/value betting a weak hand or trying to steal.\n\nMy stack: 118 chips (59 BB). I've invested 2 (BB) + 4 (flop) + 4 (turn) = 10 chips so far. I have 108 chips left.\n\nIf I check, MiniMax-M2 might bet. If he bets small again (like 4 chips), I'd have to decide whether to call with my pair of tens. Pot would be 34 (if he bets 4), so I'd be getting 34:4 = 8.5:1 odds. That's good odds, but my hand might be no good.\n\nIf I raise, I could try to take it down now. But raising would be risky - if MiniMax-M2 has a real hand, he might call or re-raise. And Kimi-K2 might wake up with something.\n\nActually, wait. I should think about what hands make sense. MiniMax-M2 limped preflop, bet small on flop and turn. Could have Ace-rag, King-rag, maybe a draw that missed (like QJ for gutshot, or 78 for open-ended). Board: 5h Tc Kh Ad 6c. Draws that missed: QJ (needs Q or J), 78 (needs 7 or 8), 79 (needs 7 or 9), 89 (needs 8 or 9). Also flush draws impossible.\n\nHe could have a weak Ace (A2-A9), weak King (KQ, KJ, KT, K9, etc.), two pair (AT, KT, maybe A5, A6), sets (TT, 55, 66, KK, AA but unlikely given preflop limp).\n\nMy pair of tens with 4 kicker is weak. I'm only beating bluffs and maybe some random low pairs like 99, 88, 77, etc. But those hands might not bet flop and turn.\n\nActually, let me check: I have second pair with weak kicker. On this board with Ace and King, many better hands exist.\n\nI think checking is best. If MiniMax-M2 bets small, I might call getting good odds. If he bets big, I can fold.\n\nBut wait - I'm first to act after seat 2 checked. I could try a small bet to fold out weak hands. But seat 4 is the aggressor this hand - he's been betting. He might interpret a bet from me as strength and fold his bluffs, but call with better hands.\n\nActually, I should consider that seat 2 checked. He might have a weak hand. Seat 4 might check behind with a weak hand too.\n\nIf I check, and seat 4 checks behind, we go to showdown. My pair of tens might win if both have nothing.\n\nIf I bet, I risk getting raised by seat 4 who has been betting.\n\nGiven my weak hand and the fact that I'm out of position (SB), checking seems prudent. Let the aggressor (seat 4) decide what to do.\n\nI'll check."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation. I'm in the SB with 4d Td. Board is 5h Tc Kh Ad 6c. I have a pair of tens with a 4 kicker. This is a relatively weak hand. The board shows Ace high, King, Ten, 6, 5. There are no flushes possible (all different suits). Possible straights: QJ would make a straight (but not on board), 7-8 would make a straight, 9-J would make a straight.\n\nMy hand: pair of tens. I'm beating bluffs, but losing to any Ace, King, two pair, sets, straights.\n\nPot is 30 chips. Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) checked. I can check or raise. If I check, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) will act. He's been betting small amounts (4 chips) on flop and turn. He might bet again on river.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from search results:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has raised preflop several times (hands 7, 11, 12). Seems aggressive preflop. In this hand, he just called preflop, checked flop, called bet, checked turn, called bet, checked river. This seems like a weak line - maybe a draw that missed or a weak pair.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): From hand 9, he raised on flop with 2d 6d on board 5h Js Jh when facing a bet, then folded to a re-raise. Seems capable of aggression but also folds to pressure. In this hand, he limped preflop, bet 4 on flop, bet 4 on turn. Small bets could be probing/value betting a weak hand or trying to steal.\n\nMy stack: 118 chips (59 BB). I've invested 2 (BB) + 4 (flop) + 4 (turn) = 10 chips so far. I have 108 chips left.\n\nIf I check, MiniMax-M2 might bet. If he bets small again (like 4 chips), I'd have to decide whether to call with my pair of tens. Pot would be 34 (if he bets 4), so I'd be getting 34:4 = 8.5:1 odds. That's good odds, but my hand might be no good.\n\nIf I raise, I could try to take it down now. But raising would be risky - if MiniMax-M2 has a real hand, he might call or re-raise. And Kimi-K2 might wake up with something.\n\nActually, wait. I should think about what hands make sense. MiniMax-M2 limped preflop, bet small on flop and turn. Could have Ace-rag, King-rag, maybe a draw that missed (like QJ for gutshot, or 78 for open-ended). Board: 5h Tc Kh Ad 6c. Draws that missed: QJ (needs Q or J), 78 (needs 7 or 8), 79 (needs 7 or 9), 89 (needs 8 or 9). Also flush draws impossible.\n\nHe could have a weak Ace (A2-A9), weak King (KQ, KJ, KT, K9, etc.), two pair (AT, KT, maybe A5, A6), sets (TT, 55, 66, KK, AA but unlikely given preflop limp).\n\nMy pair of tens with 4 kicker is weak. I'm only beating bluffs and maybe some random low pairs like 99, 88, 77, etc. But those hands might not bet flop and turn.\n\nActually, let me check: I have second pair with weak kicker. On this board with Ace and King, many better hands exist.\n\nI think checking is best. If MiniMax-M2 bets small, I might call getting good odds. If he bets big, I can fold.\n\nBut wait - I'm first to act after seat 2 checked. I could try a small bet to fold out weak hands. But seat 4 is the aggressor this hand - he's been betting. He might interpret a bet from me as strength and fold his bluffs, but call with better hands.\n\nActually, I should consider that seat 2 checked. He might have a weak hand. Seat 4 might check behind with a weak hand too.\n\nIf I check, and seat 4 checks behind, we go to showdown. My pair of tens might win if both have nothing.\n\nIf I bet, I risk getting raised by seat 4 who has been betting.\n\nGiven my weak hand and the fact that I'm out of position (SB), checking seems prudent. Let the aggressor (seat 4) decide what to do.\n\nI'll check.",

So they seem fairly tight/foldy from BB.\n\n**My position:** Button is the best position - I get to act last postflop.\n\n**Hand strength:** A7o is a marginal hand. Ace-high with weak kicker. However, in position against a single opponent (BB) who has been folding a lot, this could be a good spot to steal the blinds.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 1 to win 3, so 3:1 pot odds (33% equity needed). A7o likely has >33% equity against a random BB hand.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 58.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. Not desperate.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Could be reasonable since A7o is weak.\n2. **Call:** Complete to see a flop cheaply in position.\n3. **Raise:** Try to steal the blinds given opponent's fold tendency.\n\nLooking at opponent's history: they've folded 6/7 times from BB. Only called once. This suggests they're folding a lot to preflop raises. A raise to 6 (3x BB) might take it down immediately.\n\nGiven my position and opponent's tightness, a raise seems optimal. If they call, I have position and can play postflop well. If they fold, I win 3 chips with minimal risk.\n\nI should raise to 6 (3x BB). This is a standard button raise size. Let's calculate: minimum raise is to 4, but 6 is better sizing.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 6,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Button position with A7o against tight BB who has folded 6/7 hands preflop.

That's 2.5:1 odds, which is good for set mining (set odds are about 7.5:1, but implied odds make up for it).\n\n**Decision:** I should call. If I raise, I'm bloating the pot with a weak hand that doesn't play well postflop without a set. Calling keeps the pot small and allows me to realize my equity cheaply. If I miss the flop, I can easily fold to aggression.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns I should consider... Looking at my own history: I won hand 14 with pocket 8s from CO with a raise, and hand 17 with A7s from SB with a raise. I've been playing somewhat aggressively when I have decent hands.\n\nGiven the tight tendencies of the SB and the fact that BB has folded to button raises before (hand 15, 16, 17), a raise might get folds.

I have to call 2 to win a pot of 9 (7+2). That's 4.5:1 pot odds.\n\nMy hand: pocket 4s, so I have a small pocket pair. The flop is 8h 2h 9s, which is relatively dry except for the heart flush draw. My hand is basically bottom pair with a gutshot straight draw (I need a 5 for a straight, though 4-5-6-7-8, actually wait 4-5-6-7-8 would be a straight, but the board is 8-9-2, so I'd need 5-6-7 for a straight, that's not a gutshot - actually 4-5-6-7-8 would be a straight, but the board has 8-9-2, so I'd need specifically 5-6-7 to make a straight, that's not realistic. Actually with 44 on 892 board, I have no straight draws. Just bottom pair.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: GPT-OSS-120B has bet on the flop 4 out of 5 times when they've been in position to bet on the flop (hand 1, 2, 6, 10 they bet, hand 8 they checked). They seem to be aggressive postflop. They also raised preflop several times (hands 10, 11, 15). They have a big stack of 301 chips vs my 118.\n\nGiven the small bet size (2 into 7, about 29% pot), this could be a continuation bet with a wide range. The BB checked preflop, so they could have any two cards. My 44 has showdown value as bottom pair, but it's vulnerable to overcards and draws.\n\nWith 4.5:1 pot odds, I only need about 18% equity to call. Even with bottom pair, I likely have at least 30% equity against a random hand. However, if they have an overpair, two overcards, or a draw, my equity varies.\n\nGiven my position (button), I have position advantage for future streets. My stack is 118 (59 BB), which is medium-short but not desperate.\n\nI think calling is reasonable here. Folding seems too tight given the price. Raising could be an option to take the pot away, but with bottom pair and a flush draw on board, I might get called by better hands or draws.\n\nLet me consider: If I call, pot becomes 11. If turn bricks, they might check and I can take a free card, or bet if checked to. If turn brings an overcard or completes draws, I can reevaluate.\n\nGiven opponent's aggression, they might fire another barrel on turn. But with position, I can control the action.\n\nI'll call."

          "content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\nI have pocket 4s on the turn with board: 8h 2h 9s 2s. The pot is 15 chips and opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) bet 6 into 15. I need to call 6.\n\nMy hand: 44 with board 8h 2h 9s 2s. I have a pair of 4s, but there's a pair of 2s on board. My hand is essentially bottom pair with 4s, but the board has 2 pair (2s and 8/9). Actually wait: board shows 8h 2h 9s 2s - so there are two 2s on board, making it a pair of 2s on board. My 4s are not matching anything on board, so I have just pocket 4s, which is a weak hand.\n\nThe board is relatively dry: 8h 2h 9s 2s. There's a flush draw with hearts (8h, 2h on board plus turn 2s is spades). I have 4s 4h - I have the 4h, so I have one heart. Not a flush draw.\n\nWhat could opponent have? They bet small on flop (2 into ~6 pot) and now bet 6 into 15 on turn. This is a 40% pot bet. Looking at opponent's history: they frequently bet on turn (4 times in 10 hands). They seem aggressive.\n\nMy stack: 116 chips (58 BB). Opponent has 295 chips. I'm on the button.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 6 to win 21 (15 + 6). That's about 3.5:1 odds, or ~22% equity needed.\n\nWhat hands could I be beating? Possibly opponent has a draw (hearts), Ace-high, or a smaller pocket pair. But they could also have a 2 (trips), a 9, an 8, or an overpair.\n\nGiven the board paired 2s, it's less likely they have a 2 since 2x hands are rarely played preflop from BB after I limped. But possible.\n\nMy hand has some implied odds if I hit a 4 (2 outs) for quads, or backdoor straight draw? 4s could give me a straight with 5-6-7? Actually board is 8-2-9-2, so 4 doesn't help much.\n\nActually, I should consider that I limped preflop from BTN with 44. Opponent checked BB. They led small on flop (2 into 6), I called. Now they bet turn.\n\nThis looks like they could be betting for value with a hand like 9x, 8x, or a 2. Or they could be bluffing with a draw.\n\nGiven my weak hand (bottom pair that's actually worse than board pairs), I should probably fold. But let me think about opponent tendencies more.\n\nFrom the data: opponent has bet turn in 4 of 4 hands where we have data. They seem to be aggressive on turns. Could be continuation betting.\n\nMy hand has some showdown value but very weak. Pot odds are decent (22% equity needed). Do I have 22% equity?\n\nAgainst a reasonable range: top pair (9x, 8x), overpairs (TT+, maybe 77?), draws (hearts), trips (2x). Against this range, my 44 has maybe 15-20% equity? Let me think: against trips (2x) I'm drawing dead except to quads. Against top pair (9x), I have 2 outs. Against overpairs, I have 2 outs. Against draws, I'm ahead but vulnerable.\n\nActually, if opponent has a draw, I'm currently ahead but could lose on river.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and my medium stack (58 BB), I should be cautious. Folding seems reasonable.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting 3.5:1 odds. If I think opponent is bluffing sometimes, maybe I should call? However, my hand has little improvement potential (only 2 outs to quads).\n\nActually, I have 2 outs to quads (4s), and maybe some runner-runner straight possibilities? Unlikely.\n\nI think fold is correct. Let me check if there's any history of opponent bluffing on turn.\n\nSearch for showdowns with this opponent."

Seems tight.\n2. **MiniMax-M2:** Has folded 7 out of 10 hands preflop, called BB once, and showed aggression postflop in one hand.\n3. **GPT-OSS-120B:** Has raised twice preflop, folded 5 times, checked once in BB. Shows some aggression.\n\n**My hand analysis:** K5o is a very weak hand, especially from UTG. It's not suited, not connected, and has reverse implied odds (if I hit a K, I could be dominated by better Kx hands). In early position with this weak hand, standard play is to fold.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 58 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands from early position.\n\n**Position:** Being UTG is terrible for this hand. I have to act first on every street, making it hard to realize equity.\n\n**Potential actions:**\n- **Fold:** Correct with K5o from UTG\n- **Call:** Would put 2 chips in, but then I'm out of position with a weak hand against potentially 3 opponents\n- **Raise:** Would be a bluff, but K5o doesn't have good bluffing properties\n\n**Pot odds:** Need to call 2 to win 5 (current 3 + my 2), so getting 2.5:1. But hand is so weak that pot odds don't justify calling.\n\nGiven all factors, the clear decision is to fold. This hand should not be played from UTG, especially with my stack size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K5o is too weak from UTG position. With 58 BB stack, no need to play marginal hands out of position. Opponents behind include aggressive players (GPT-OSS-120B has raised twice). Standard fold with this hand in early position.\"\n}",

The blinds are 1/2, so I need to call 2 chips to see the flop.\n\nFrom my hand history, I can see that in hand #15 when I was UTG with 9d 2h, I folded. That's a similarly weak hand. 65o is a terrible hand to play from UTG - it's unsuited, low cards, no connectivity except for a straight draw possibility. Playing this from early position is generally a losing proposition.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised preflop before. There are 4 players left to act after me (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, and the blinds). I could face raises behind me.\n\nGiven my position (UTG), the weakness of my hand (65o), and the fact that I have 58 BB which is a reasonable stack to preserve, folding is the correct play. Calling 2 chips with this hand from UTG would be a mistake as I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand with a weak hand.\n\nTournament considerations: With 58 BB, I should be patient and wait for better spots. There's no reason to get involved with 65o from UTG.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"65o is too weak to play from UTG.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: 2c 8d - This is a very weak hand. 2-8 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. It has very little potential to make strong hands post-flop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, which means I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand if I call. This is a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 112 chips (28 BB), which is a medium stack. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 166 chips (41.5 BB).\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**: From the data, Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has:\n   - Only raised once preflop in 20 hands (hand #4, raised to 4)\n   - Mostly folds preflop (14 folds)\n   - Called once preflop (hand #11, called 8)\n   - Showed pocket 8s in hand #2\n   - Has been relatively tight/passive preflop\n\n5. **The bet**: Seat 1 raised to 12 total (8 more to call). This is a 3x raise from UTG. Given their tight tendencies, this likely represents a strong hand.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise). I need to call 8 to win 18, giving me 2.25:1 pot odds (31% equity needed). My hand has nowhere near 31% equity against a likely strong UTG raising range.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 28 BB, I need to preserve my stack. Getting involved with 2-8o out of position against what's likely a strong hand is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n8. **Alternatives**: Folding is clearly correct. Calling would be a huge mistake. Raising with this hand would be even worse.\n\nThe only reasonable play is to fold. I'm getting poor pot odds with a terrible hand against a likely strong opponent range, and I'm out of position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2-8 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands.

          "content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand**: Tc Ts (pocket tens) - a strong starting hand\n**Position**: SB (small blind) - not great position, but we're facing a raise from UTG (seat 1)\n**Stack**: 110 chips (27.5 BB) - relatively short stack\n**Pot**: 18 chips currently\n**Amount to call**: 10 chips\n**Minimum raise to**: 20 chips (total, not additional)\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has folded 9 times preflop in a row before this hand\n- This is their first raise in the last 10 hands (hand #21)\n- They showed down pocket 8s in hand #2\n\nMy own history:\n- I've been playing tight (folded 16 of 21 hands)\n- Won 3 hands (with raises preflop in two of them)\n- Current stack is below average (110 vs others with 172, 193, 195, 312)\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Pocket tens is a premium hand, especially with my stack size. It's top 3% of starting hands.\n2. **Opponent tendencies**: The raiser has been very tight (folded 9 straight hands), so their raise likely indicates a strong hand (maybe JJ+, AK, AQs). But since this is their first raise, they could also be opening up their range.\n3. **Stack considerations**: With 27.5 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Pocket tens is definitely a hand worth getting all-in with preflop.\n4. **Position**: Being in SB is bad, but the BB hasn't acted yet. However, BB is seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) with 195 chips.\n5. **Options**:\n   - **Fold**: Too weak with pocket tens\n   - **Call**: 10 chips to call into 18 pot (1.8:1 odds). Could set up a flop play, but out of position\n   - **Raise**: Minimum raise to 20 (8 more chips) or 3-bet bigger\n\nGiven my stack size, I should consider a 3-bet or even shove. Let me calculate:\n- If I raise to 20: total investment 20 (I already put 2 SB)\n- If I go all-in: 110 total\n\nThe pot is 18, opponent raised to 12. If I raise to 20, they need to call 8 more. If they call, pot would be ~40. If they fold, I win 18.\n\nBut with pocket tens and a short stack, I should consider a more aggressive line. A 3-bet to ~30-40 might be good, but I only have 110 total. Actually, a shove might be best here - it puts maximum pressure, and if called, I'm likely ahead of many hands except JJ+, AK.\n\nHowever, let me think about tournament survival. I have 27.5 BB, which is still playable. A shove risks my tournament life. But pocket tens is strong.\n\nActually, considering the opponent's tightness and this being their first raise, they might have a very strong hand. But pocket tens is still good.\n\nI think a 3-bet to around 30-35 is reasonable. That's about 25-30% of my stack, committing me to the hand. But actually, with 110 total, raising to 35 leaves me with 75 behind, pot would be ~50, so I'd be pot-committed anyway.\n\nGiven stack sizes, I think a shove is appropriate. Let me check: if I shove for 110, opponent has to call 98 more into pot of 128 (18 + 110). They're getting about 1.3:1 odds. They'd need ~43% equity to call. If they have JJ+, AK, they have good equity against TT.\n\nBut actually, a shove might fold out hands like AQ, AJ, KQ that might call a smaller raise. And it puts maximum pressure on hands like JJ that might be unsure.\n\nWait, but the BB still needs to act. If I raise small, BB might come along. If I shove, BB likely folds unless they have a monster.\n\nGiven everything, I think a shove is best. Pocket tens is strong, my stack is short-ish, and I want to maximize fold equity and potentially double up.\n\nBut let me consider a smaller 3-bet first. Actually, with 110 total, raising to 30 leaves me with 80 behind. Pot would be 50. Any flop bet would commit me.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand**: Tc Ts (pocket tens) - a strong starting hand\n**Position**: SB (small blind) - not great position, but we're facing a raise from UTG (seat 1)\n**Stack**: 110 chips (27.5 BB) - relatively short stack\n**Pot**: 18 chips currently\n**Amount to call**: 10 chips\n**Minimum raise to**: 20 chips (total, not additional)\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has folded 9 times preflop in a row before this hand\n- This is their first raise in the last 10 hands (hand #21)\n- They showed down pocket 8s in hand #2\n\nMy own history:\n- I've been playing tight (folded 16 of 21 hands)\n- Won 3 hands (with raises preflop in two of them)\n- Current stack is below average (110 vs others with 172, 193, 195, 312)\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Pocket tens is a premium hand, especially with my stack size. It's top 3% of starting hands.\n2. **Opponent tendencies**: The raiser has been very tight (folded 9 straight hands), so their raise likely indicates a strong hand (maybe JJ+, AK, AQs). But since this is their first raise, they could also be opening up their range.\n3. **Stack considerations**: With 27.5 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Pocket tens is definitely a hand worth getting all-in with preflop.\n4. **Position**: Being in SB is bad, but the BB hasn't acted yet. However, BB is seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) with 195 chips.\n5. **Options**:\n   - **Fold**: Too weak with pocket tens\n   - **Call**: 10 chips to call into 18 pot (1.8:1 odds). Could set up a flop play, but out of position\n   - **Raise**: Minimum raise to 20 (8 more chips) or 3-bet bigger\n\nGiven my stack size, I should consider a 3-bet or even shove. Let me calculate:\n- If I raise to 20: total investment 20 (I already put 2 SB)\n- If I go all-in: 110 total\n\nThe pot is 18, opponent raised to 12. If I raise to 20, they need to call 8 more. If they call, pot would be ~40. If they fold, I win 18.\n\nBut with pocket tens and a short stack, I should consider a more aggressive line. A 3-bet to ~30-40 might be good, but I only have 110 total. Actually, a shove might be best here - it puts maximum pressure, and if called, I'm likely ahead of many hands except JJ+, AK.\n\nHowever, let me think about tournament survival. I have 27.5 BB, which is still playable. A shove risks my tournament life. But pocket tens is strong.\n\nActually, considering the opponent's tightness and this being their first raise, they might have a very strong hand. But pocket tens is still good.\n\nI think a 3-bet to around 30-35 is reasonable. That's about 25-30% of my stack, committing me to the hand. But actually, with 110 total, raising to 35 leaves me with 75 behind, pot would be ~50, so I'd be pot-committed anyway.\n\nGiven stack sizes, I think a shove is appropriate. Let me check: if I shove for 110, opponent has to call 98 more into pot of 128 (18 + 110). They're getting about 1.3:1 odds. They'd need ~43% equity to call. If they have JJ+, AK, they have good equity against TT.\n\nBut actually, a shove might fold out hands like AQ, AJ, KQ that might call a smaller raise. And it puts maximum pressure on hands like JJ that might be unsure.\n\nWait, but the BB still needs to act. If I raise small, BB might come along. If I shove, BB likely folds unless they have a monster.\n\nGiven everything, I think a shove is best. Pocket tens is strong, my stack is short-ish, and I want to maximize fold equity and potentially double up.\n\nBut let me consider a smaller 3-bet first. Actually, with 110 total, raising to 30 leaves me with 80 behind. Pot would be 50. Any flop bet would commit me. So I'm effectively all-in anyway.\n\nI think shoving is cleaner and maximizes fold equity. If called, I'm likely racing against overcards or slightly behind an overpair.\n\n",

My stack is 110 (27.5 BB). The pot is 18, I need to call 10. Minimum raise to 20.\n\nOptions: fold, call, raise. With pocket tens, fold is too weak. Call could be okay but out of position. Raise is good.\n\nWhat raise size? Minimum raise to 20 is only 8 more chips than calling. That's not much of a 3-bet. Could raise bigger. With 110 total, a standard 3-bet might be to 30-35. Or shove all-in for 110.\n\nLet me think about opponent's range. They've been tight, folded 9 hands in a row. Their first raise could be strong: maybe JJ+, AK, AQs. Maybe wider since they might be opening up.\n\nIf they have JJ+, I'm in bad shape. If they have AK, AQ, I'm ahead. Pocket tens is ahead of many hands.\n\nWith my stack size, a shove is reasonable. But I have 27.5 BB, which isn't super short. In tournament play, 20+ BB is still playable. Shoving with TT might be a bit aggressive but acceptable.\n\nAlternative: 3-bet to 30-35. That commits about 1/3 of my stack. If called, pot is ~50, I have 75-80 behind. Then on flop, I'm basically committed anyway.\n\nActually, with 110 total, if I raise to 35, I have 75 behind. Pot would be ~55. Any reasonable c-bet would commit me. So I'm effectively all-in.\n\nShoving simplifies things. Gets max fold equity. If called, I'm racing.\n\nBut wait, the BB still has to act. If I raise to 35, BB might call with position. If I shove, BB likely folds unless they have a monster.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, I want to accumulate chips. TT is a good hand to do that with.\n\nI think I'll go with a shove. It's a strong move with a strong hand.\n\nSo action: raise, raise_to: 110 (all-in).\n\nReasoning: Pocket tens is a premium hand with my stack size. Shoving maximizes fold equity and simplifies post-flop play. Opponent has been tight but this is their first raise, so their range may include hands like AJ+, KQ that will fold to a shove. If called, I'm likely racing against overcards or slightly behind an overpair, which is acceptable given pot odds and tournament dynamics.\n\nLet me output JSON.",

But the action says \"Seat 3 raise 110\" - that must be a mistake or I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the \"raise 110\" is what I would have raised to if I had chips? Actually, I think the system is showing the raise amount relative to something. Let me think: I have 2 chips. I posted SB 2, so I have 0 left? Wait, I posted SB 2 from my stack of 2, leaving me with 0. But then I raised? That doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: I have 2 chips (0.5 BB). That means I'm essentially all-in already. The pot is 224 chips, which includes my all-in bet. Seat 1 called my all-in. On flop and turn, since I'm all-in, there's no more betting for me. I just check because I have no chips left. The action shows \"flop: Seat 3 check\" and \"flop: Seat 1 check\". Now turn, amount to call is 0, legal actions are fold, check. I can't fold when I'm all-in - I have to see the hand through. I should check.\n\nBut wait, I have the option to fold? That's weird if I'm all-in. Maybe I'm not all-in? Let me check the pot size again. Blinds 2/4. Seat 1 raised to 12. I have 2 chips. If I go all-in for 2 chips, that's just calling 2 (since I already posted 2 as SB). Actually, I posted SB 2, so to call the raise of 12, I need to put in 10 more. But I only have 2 total, so I can only put in 2 total. That means my all-in is 2 chips total, which is less than the raise. Seat 1 raised to 12, I call all-in for 2. Then Seat 1 gets back change? Actually, in poker, if someone raises and another player goes all-in for less, there's a side pot. But the main pot includes my all-in amount.\n\nLet me calculate: SB 2, BB 4, Seat 1 raises to 12. I have 2 chips total. I can only put in 2. So I'm all-in for 2. The main pot would be: my 2 + SB 2? Wait, I already posted SB 2 from my 2 chips, so I have 0 left.

Board: 8c As 5c Kh. Amount to call: 0. Legal actions: fold, check.\n\nKey points:\n1. I have pocket tens - a medium pair\n2. Board has A, K, 8, 5 with two clubs\n3. I have the Tc, giving me a club flush draw possibility\n4. My stack is only 2 chips - I'm essentially all-in or very close to it\n5. The pot is huge (224 chips) relative to my stack\n6. I'm getting infinite pot odds since I don't have to put anything more in\n\nGiven that amount to call is 0 and I can check, I should check to see the river. Even though my hand is weak against an A or K, I have some equity with:\n- Two tens for a set (2 outs)\n- Backdoor straight possibilities? Not really with this board\n- Flush draw with Tc (need two more clubs)\n\nActually, I have one club already (Tc). Board has 8c and 5c, so I need two more clubs on turn and river. The turn is Kh (not a club), so I need river to be a club. That's 9 outs (13 clubs total - 3 visible = 10 remaining, but one is the T\u2663 which I already have, so 9 clubs left).\n\nWait, I have Tc, board has 8c and 5c. That's 3 clubs total. 13 clubs in deck - 3 = 10 clubs left. But I already have Tc, so actually 9 other clubs could help. Plus 2 tens for a set. So total 11 outs.\n\nBut I'm getting infinite pot odds (0 to call for 224 pot). Even with weak equity, I should check and see the river. Folding would be terrible when it costs nothing.\n\nActually, can I fold when I'm all-in? In tournament poker, if you're all-in, you can't fold - you have to see the hand through. But the system is giving me fold as an option. Maybe I'm not technically all-in? Let me check the stack sizes again.\n\nI have 2 chips. Blinds are 2/4. I posted SB 2. That would leave me with 0. But the system says my stack is 2 chips. Maybe the 2 chips is what I have left after posting? Actually, if I start with 2 chips and post SB 2, I'd have 0. But the system shows \"Your Stack: 2 chips\". Maybe that's my starting stack for this hand? Or maybe I have 2 chips left after previous action?\n\nLet me look at the preflop action: \"Seat 3 raise 110\". That suggests I raised to 110, which is impossible with 2 chips. This might be a display issue. But regardless, current situation: amount to call is 0, I can check. I should check.\n\nActually, thinking about tournament strategy: I have 0.5 BB. That's critically short. I need to double up soon. This pot is huge. Even with weak hand, I should see it through since it costs nothing.\n\nMy reasoning: With 0 chips to call, checking gives me a chance to win a huge pot. Folding would be throwing away any chance. My tens have some equity against various hands. Opponent checked flop, which might indicate weakness or trapping with a strong hand like AK, AA, KK. But still, free chance to win.\n\nI'll check.",

Actually board: 8c As 5c Kh Jh - so 8c is clubs, 5c is clubs, so two clubs on board). My Tc is a club, so I have a club flush draw? Wait I have Tc (ten of clubs) and Ts (ten of spades). So I have the ten of clubs, giving me a club flush draw. Board has 8c and 5c, so I need two more clubs for a flush. The river is Jh (jack of hearts), not a club.

How could I raise to 110 with only 2 chips? Actually my stack is 2 chips now, but maybe I had more chips earlier? Let's think: This is hand #22, maybe my stack was larger earlier and I went all-in preflop with 110 chips? But now my stack is 2 chips. That suggests I already put in 110 chips and now have 2 left? Wait: I posted SB 2, then raised to 110. That would require 108 more chips. If I had 110 total, after posting SB 2 I'd have 108 left, raise to 110 means I put in 108 more, total 110.

Opponent checked flop and turn. They might have missed or have a weak hand. They called my preflop raise, so they have something decent. But they checked twice. Could be a medium pair like 99, QQ?

Playing weak hands like this can quickly erode my stack.\n\n**Recent Pattern**: Looking at my hand history, I've been calling with weak hands from the button and then folding post-flop, which is not profitable. My win rate is only 17.5%.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown some aggressive play with raises, indicating they have a reasonable range.\n\n**Pot Odds**: While the call is only 8 chips into a 12-chip pot (giving me 2:1 odds), the fundamental issue is that 6s 5c has very little equity against any reasonable opponent range.\n\nThis is a clear fold. 6s 5c is too weak to play profitably, even from the button position, and continuing this pattern of calling with weak hands will hurt my tournament prospects.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"6s 5c is a very weak hand with minimal equity.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n1. **Hand Analysis**: I have 6s 5c - this is a weak suited connector, essentially a garbage hand. It's not strong enough to play aggressively from any position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position, but my hand is too weak to take advantage of position.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 217 chips (27.1 BB), which is a medium stack. Kimi-K2 Thinking has 445 chips, and GPT-OSS-120B has 312 chips.\n\n4. **Previous Actions**: \n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted the small blind (4 chips)\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted the big blind (8 chips)\n   - The pot is currently 12 chips\n   - I need to call 8 chips to stay in the hand\n\n5. **My Recent History**: Looking at my last 5 hands from BTN position:\n   - Hand #43: Called with 9h Ts, lost\n   - Hand #46: Called with 7h As, folded on turn\n   - Hand #49: Folded with 5h 9d immediately\n   - Hand #52: Called with Ac 2h, folded on flop\n   - Hand #55: Called with 8d 9c, folded on turn\n\n   I can see a pattern of calling with weak hands and then folding, which is not profitable. My win rate is only 17.5%.\n\n6. **Opponent Analysis**: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been active with some raises (hands #54 and #56) and folds. They seem to be playing reasonably tight-aggressive.\n\n7. **Decision**: This is a clear fold. 6s 5c is too weak to play, even from the button. The hand has very little equity against any reasonable range, and I would be playing out of position post-flop against at least one opponent.\n   \nPot odds aren't favorable, and the hand's potential is minimal. With such weak cards, continuing would be a strategic mistake that could quickly deplete my chip stack.",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop from BB with 3d9h, stack 312, blind 8, small blind 4 posted by us? Actually seat5 is BB, but actions show we posted SB 4 then seat1 posted BB 8? Wait seat5 is BB but they posted sb? Something off. Possibly seat5 is BB but also posted small blind? Might be mislabel. Anyway we are in BB with 3d9h, not a strong hand. In early position? Actually BB is last to act preflop after SB and BB posted. There's only seat1 (BB) and seat5 (SB?) Actually seat1 posted BB 8, seat5 posted sb 4. So we are SB with 3d9h. So we are out of position post-flop. Should we fold? 3-9 offsuit is weak, not a steal. In SB, typical raise range is maybe broader but 3-9 is too weak. So fold. Legal actions include fold, call, raise. Amount to call is 4 (big blind). We could call 4 and see flop out of position with weak hand, not good. So fold.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Calling the 4\u2011chip big blind would commit chips with a marginal hand, and raising would be too aggressive for such a weak combo. Folding preserves stack and avoids playing a hand likely to be dominated.",

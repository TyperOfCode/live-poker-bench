Likely playing tight.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has raised preflop in both previous hands (to 6 and 8 chips). Shows aggressive tendencies. Also continued betting on flop and turn in both hands.\n\n**Position Advantage:**\nBeing on the button is a huge advantage. I act last postflop, which gives me maximum information and control.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n2c 4s is a terrible hand. Even on the button, it's borderline unplayable. The only redeeming quality is being suited, but 2-4 offsuit would be worse.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack (94.5 BB). No need to take unnecessary risks with trash hands.\n\n**Potential Play:**\nWith position and both blinds having shown tendencies (SB tight, BB aggressive), I could consider a steal attempt. However:\n1. My hand has almost no postflop playability\n2. BB has shown aggression and might defend or 3-bet\n3. Even if I steal successfully, I only win 3 chips\n4. If I get called or raised, I'm playing a very weak hand out of position relative to the caller\n\nThe risk/reward isn't good. 2-4 suited is a hand I might consider limping with in some very specific multi-way pot situations, but not for a steal attempt from the button against an aggressive BB.\n\n**Decision:**\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. My stack is healthy, and I don't need to gamble with 2-4 suited.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2c4s is too weak even on the button against an aggressive BB who has raised both previous hands.

Even though I'm getting good pot odds (1 chip to call for 3 in pot), this hand rarely wins big pots and lacks the implied odds needed to justify the call. My opponent GPT-OSS-120B has shown aggressive tendencies in previous hands, suggesting they likely have a stronger range. With a healthy stack of 98.5 BB, I can afford to wait for a better spot.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 2h Ks (offsuit)\n- Position: Button (BTN) - good position\n- Stack: 264 chips (66 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- Action: I posted SB (2), BB posted 4, two players folded\n- Amount to call: 2 (to complete from SB to BB)\n- Minimum raise: 8\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent's actions (Kimi-K2 in seat 2), I can see:\n- They fold frequently preflop (hands 26, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36)\n- When they do play, they sometimes raise (hands 27, 28, 30)\n- They made a big raise of 72 on the turn in hand 25\n- In hand 28, they showed aggression with a bet of 20 and raise to 80 on flop, but then checked and folded on turn\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- K2o is a weak hand, especially offsuit\n- King is decent but 2 kicker is very weak\n- From SB position (effectively), this is a fold in most situations\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm on the Button but posted SB, so I'll act first postflop\n- This is not ideal - I'd rather have position throughout the hand\n- However, since it's heads-up against BB, position matters less\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Need to call 2 to win 6 (pot odds 3:1)\n- This is attractive pot odds, but with K2o, even these odds don't justify calling\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 66 BB\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Better to preserve chips for better opportunities\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. K2o is a trash hand, and even though I'm getting decent pot odds, the hand has very poor equity against any random hand the BB might have. The opponent seems to fold a lot preflop but can be aggressive when they play, so I don't want to get involved with such a weak hand. I should fold and move on.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Hand Information:**\n- Position: UTG (Seat 1) - Early position\n- Cards: Kc Qh (King of clubs, Queen of hearts)\n- Stack: 184 chips (92 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- Amount to call: 2\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nKQ offsuit is a decent hand but very vulnerable from early position. It's often dominated by AK, AQ, AA, KK, QQ. From UTG, this is typically a fold in tournaments because:\n1. We're likely to face raises from better hands\n2. If we raise, we might get 3-bet\n3. If we call and hit top pair, we could lose a big pot to better kickers\n\n**Opponent Observations from recent hands:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3): Has been aggressive preflop (raised to 6 in hand 8), but also folds to pressure\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Tends to call preflop (called in hand 9), but raised on flop\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Active preflop raiser (raised in hands 10 and 11), but folded to a 3-bet in hand 11\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Folded multiple times, called a raise in hand 10 but folded to turn pressure\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 92 BB\n- No need to take marginal spots from early position\n- Better to preserve chips for better spots\n\n**Position Factor:**\n- UTG is the worst position\n- 4 players still to act behind me\n- High chance someone has a better hand\n\n**Recommendation:**\nFold KQo from UTG. It's not strong enough to raise from this position, and calling would put us in a tough spot post-flop. We want to avoid being dominated by AK, AQ, AA, KK, QQ. \n\n{action: \"fold\", raise_to: null, reasoning: \"KQ offsuit is too weak to play from UTG in a tournament. We're likely dominated by better hands and have 4 players still to act. Preserve chips for better spots.\"}",

The opponent Kimi-K2 in seat 2 raised to 6 (3x BB). I need to call 5 chips to stay in the hand. The pot is currently 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise).\n\nLooking at the opponent's history: Kimi-K2 has raised preflop twice before (hand 7 and hand 11). In hand 7 they raised to 6, same as now. In hand 11 they raised to 24 (much larger). They've folded preflop 3 times, called once. So they seem somewhat active but not overly aggressive.\n\nWith 4d7c offsuit, this is a bottom-tier hand. Even from the small blind, calling with such a weak hand is generally not good. The pot odds: I need to call 5 to win 9, which is about 1.8:1 odds or 35.7% equity needed. 4d7c has about 30-35% equity against a typical raising range, but that's against random cards. Against a real raising range, it's worse.\n\nPosition is bad - I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand. Stack preservation is important in tournaments. My stack is 125 chips, which is healthy but not huge. Calling 5 chips (4% of my stack) isn't terrible, but I'll be playing a weak hand out of position.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. The small blind is a tough position, but with such a weak hand, folding is correct. I could consider a raise as a bluff, but with 4d7c it's too weak even for that, and I'd be risking too much.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations. The big blind (MiniMax-M2) is still to act behind me if I call. They could squeeze. So folding seems best.\n\nDecision: fold.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n1. My hand: Jd 2s - This is a very weak hand, especially suited connectors with a low kicker. Jack-2 suited is generally considered a very weak hand.\n\n2. Position: I'm in the Big Blind (BB), so I get to see the flop for \"free\" if I call, but I'm facing a raise from Kimi-K2.\n\n3. The situation:\n   - Current pot: 9 chips (1 from SB + 2 from BB + 6 from Kimi-K2's raise)\n   - Amount to call: 4 chips (to match the raise)\n   - My stack: 180 chips\n   - Kimi-K2's stack: 200 chips\n\n4. Kimi-K2's tendencies from the recall:\n   Looking at the last 10 preflop actions for Kimi-K2:\n   - 6 folds\n   - 2 raises (6 chips and 24 chips)\n   - 1 call\n   - 1 fold (seems like an error in the data)\n\n   This shows Kimi-K2 is generally tight (folds most hands) but when they do raise, it's often a standard raise (6 chips) or a larger raise (24 chips). The 24-chip raise suggests they might have a premium hand.\n\n5. Analysis:\n   - With Jd 2s, I have a very weak hand\n   - I'm getting good pot odds (9:4 = 2.25:1) to call and see the flop\n   - However, this is a tournament situation where I need to preserve my stack\n   - Jd 2s has very little equity against a likely range that Kimi-K2 is raising with\n   - Even if I hit the flop, I might be dominated (if I hit a Jack, Kimi-K2 likely has a better Jack)\n\n6. Decision factors:\n   - Tournament preservation is important with 180 chips\n   - Weak hand with little equity\n   - Opponent seems tight but capable of having strong hands\n   - Good pot odds but poor hand strength\n\nGiven that Jd 2s is a very weak hand and I'm in a tournament where I need to be selective with my chips, I should fold this hand. The pot odds are attractive, but the hand quality is so poor that it's not worth the risk, especially against an opponent who seems to have a tight raising range.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent tendencies:\n\nFrom Seat 2 (Kimi-K2, SB):\n- Has been folding frequently in recent hands (hands 17-20 all folded preflop)\n- Only played hand #16 where they called preflop with 5c4h (very weak hand)\n- Seems to be playing tight/passive\n\nFrom Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2, BB):\n- More active, with some preflop raises (hand #17 raised to 6)\n- Has shown willingness to defend BB\n- Has folded some hands too (hands 19-20)\n- Showed down pocket 6s in hand #6\n\nMy situation:\n- Position: Button (best position)\n- Hand: Qs 8h (offsuit, not connected, mediocre hand)\n- Stack: 178 chips (44.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Need to call 4 chips to see flop\n- Pot odds: 6:4 or 1.5:1\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Hand strength: Q8o is marginal. Not suited, not connected. Dominated by many hands.\n2. Position: Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last postflop.\n3. Opponents: SB is tight/passive, folding a lot. BB is more active but has been folding recently.\n4. Stack size: I have a comfortable stack, can afford to see flops.\n5. Tournament: Early/middle stage, no immediate pressure.\n\nGiven I'm on the button with position advantage, and both opponents have shown recent folding tendencies, I could consider a steal raise here. The SB has folded 4 straight hands preflop, and BB has folded 2 straight. They're both playing tight.\n\nHowever, Q8o is quite weak. The question is whether to:\n- Fold: Safe play, avoid trouble with marginal hand\n- Call: See flop in position with mediocre hand\n- Raise: Try to steal blinds given opponents' tightness\n\nWith the SB showing very tight play (4 consecutive folds) and BB also folding recently, a raise could be profitable as a steal attempt. A standard raise would be to about 12-16 chips (3-4x BB).\n\n\nI'll make a strategic steal attempt. A 12-chip raise puts pressure on tight opponents while minimizing risk. The raise gives me a chance to win the pot immediately or play in position if called. It's a calculated move exploiting the current table dynamics.",

This suggests a premium hand range (TT+, AQ+, possibly AK).\n\n2. **Hand Strength**: Q8o is a marginal hand that performs poorly against premium ranges. Against a typical early position raising range, Q8o has only about 25-30% equity.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm out of position post-flop, which makes it harder to realize my equity even when I hit.\n\n4. **Stack Preservation**: With a healthy 48BB stack, I should be selective about spots where I invest chips without a strong hand.\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: This is not a good spot to gamble with a marginal hand against what appears to be a very strong range.\n\nThe opponent's tight image (10 straight folds) followed by a raise indicates significant strength. Q8o is simply not strong enough to continue here, especially out of position.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Opponent folded 10 hands in a row before this raise, indicating a premium hand.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: 2c 8d - This is a very weak hand. 2-8 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. It has very little potential to make strong hands post-flop.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, which means I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand if I call. This is a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 112 chips (28 BB), which is a medium stack. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 166 chips (41.5 BB).\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**: From the data, Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has:\n   - Only raised once preflop in 20 hands (hand #4, raised to 4)\n   - Mostly folds preflop (14 folds)\n   - Called once preflop (hand #11, called 8)\n   - Showed pocket 8s in hand #2\n   - Has been relatively tight/passive preflop\n\n5. **The bet**: Seat 1 raised to 12 total (8 more to call). This is a 3x raise from UTG. Given their tight tendencies, this likely represents a strong hand.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise). I need to call 8 to win 18, giving me 2.25:1 pot odds (31% equity needed). My hand has nowhere near 31% equity against a likely strong UTG raising range.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 28 BB, I need to preserve my stack. Getting involved with 2-8o out of position against what's likely a strong hand is a recipe for losing chips.\n\n8. **Alternatives**: Folding is clearly correct. Calling would be a huge mistake. Raising with this hand would be even worse.\n\nThe only reasonable play is to fold. I'm getting poor pot odds with a terrible hand against a likely strong opponent range, and I'm out of position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2-8 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this decision step by step:\n\n1. **Position**: I'm UTG (Seat 4), which is the worst position to open. I have 4 players left to act behind me.\n\n2. **Hand**: Qh Jc - this is a suited connector with straight and flush potential, but it's not strong enough to open UTG. In standard poker theory, UTG should have a very tight opening range.\n\n3. **Stack**: 199 chips (49.8 BB) - this is a healthy stack where I don't need to take risky spots.\n\n4. **Table dynamics**: From my memory of Kimi-K2's actions, they've been playing tight recently, mostly folding. This suggests a tight table where I should be conservative.\n\n5. **From my UTG history**: Looking at my past UTG hands, I've been folding most hands (18 out of 20), which is correct. My one win was with Kd Js, which is much stronger than QJs.\n\n6. **Mathematical considerations**: Opening QJs UTG puts me in a difficult spot where:\n   - I'll likely face multiple callers, making post-flop play difficult out of position\n   - I could get 3-bet by stronger hands\n   - Even if I hit, I might not get paid off properly\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: At 49.8 BB, I should be preserving my stack for better opportunities rather than taking marginal spots.\n\nThe correct decision is clearly to fold. QJs is too weak to open UTG, especially with 4 players left to act behind me. I should wait for a stronger hand or a better position.\n",

Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., 2 raise). Typically raise to 3-4 BB = 6-8 chips. But min raise is 4 (i.e., 2 extra). Could raise larger. Legal actions include raise; we can raise to any amount above min. Should we consider stack depth? 100 BB, can open-raise 2.5-3 BB. So raise to 6 chips (3 BB) maybe.\n\nBut we must output raise_to total amount we put in. The total amount includes our call? Usually raise_to is total amount we put in this round. So if we raise to 6, that's total contribution = 6 chips. Since we already need to call 2, additional 4.

Raising could get them to call with set? They might call, but we would lose more chips. Considering stack 190, pot currently? Let's compute pot after turn before action: Preflop pot 11 (maybe). Flop: bet 4, call 4 = 8 added, pot = 19? Actually after flop, pot before betting was 11. Then we bet 4, opponent call 4, pot becomes 11+8 = 19. Turn card J added to board, no bet yet, pot stays 19. Now it's our turn with amount to call 0. So pot is 19. If we raise to 4 (minimum), we would add 4 more, pot 23. Opponent may call or fold.\n\nGiven we have top pair, maybe we should bet for value. But opponent checked, could be weak, we can extract value. However risk of set? Set of tens would be very strong; they'd likely bet, not check. But they might check to trap. In tournament with 95 BB, we can afford a raise.\n\nThus I think raise to 8 (double) maybe? Minimum raise is 4 (to total 4? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in this round. Since amount to call is 0, raise_to is the total we commit this street. Minimum raise to 4 means we must put at least 4 chips. So raise_to could be 8 to apply pressure.

          "reasoning_content": "We are on the flop. Board: Tc 3d Jh. Our hand: Jc Ad. So we have top pair (Jacks) with a gutshot straight draw (need Q for straight) and also Ace high kicker. Also we have a backdoor flush draw? No clubs: we have Jc and Ad, board has Tc (clubs) and Jh (hearts) and 3d. So we have two clubs? Actually Jc is club, board Tc is club, so we have a flush draw with two clubs (Jc and Tc). Need two more clubs for flush, but we have one club in hand and one on board; we need two more clubs on turn and river. That's a backdoor flush draw.\n\nOpponent is Kimi-K2 seat1? Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (maybe the same opponent). Seat1 called preflop. So we have a heads-up pot with us (BB) and opponent (Seat1). Pot size 19 chips. No bet to call on flop, amount to call 0. Minimum raise to 6 (so raise to total of 6? Actually raise to total amount? Since we are in BB, we have already posted 2, but raise to 6 means total bet of 6? Usually min raise is 6 total (i.e., raise to 6). So we can raise to 6, which would be 6 chips total in pot from us, meaning we add 4 chips? Actually we have already contributed 2 preflop, but flop betting starts fresh. So raising to 6 means we put 6 chips into pot now.\n\nOur stack 203. We have top pair. Opponent's range: could have many combos: maybe overpairs (QQ, KK, AA), sets (TT, JJ), two pair (TJ), straight draws (QK), etc. Board is T,J,3. Opponent could have T? Actually board has T and J, so opponent could have T? They could have T9 for two pair? Actually board has T and J, so two pair would be TT or JJ combos (set) or maybe they have JT for trips? Actually they have J? If they have J? they'd have trips. They could have KQ for straight draw? Actually KQ would need QJ? Wait board T J, need Q K for straight? The board is T,J,3. Straight possibilities: A K Q? Actually need 9-10-J? No. Straight draws: 9-10-J? board has T J, need 9 and Q? Actually a straight with board T,J would be 9-10-J-Q-K? No. The board only has two cards. So they could have Q9 for open-ended? Not yet. So they could have Q9 (needs 8 or K) not relevant.\n\nOur hand is decent. With no bet, we could check to pot control, but we have top pair and we are the aggressor preflop (raised). Might want to bet for value. However we need to consider opponent's tendencies: unknown. They called preflop. Could be wide. Since we are BB with A J, we have strong hand. Betting could extract value from weaker Jacks, tens, etc. But also could be overbet? The pot is 19. A bet of 6 (min raise) is about 0.3 pot, small. Could also raise bigger.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. No bet action? In flop, we can check or raise (bet). So we can bet 6 minimum.\n\nGiven we have top pair, we should bet for value. Opponent might call with worse Jacks (like Jx), tens, etc. Also could raise with sets. But raising bigger could risk. A small bet may get called by many.\n\nThus choose raise to 6 (i.e., bet 6). Reasoning: top pair, decent kicker, want value, pot small.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Our hand: Jc Ad gives us pair of Jacks (we have two Jacks: Jc and board J\u2665, plus also top pair with Ace kicker? Actually we have pair of Jacks, plus Ace high. Also we have a straight? Board: T, J, 5, 3. With Ace we don't have straight. Could we have a flush? No. So we have two pair (Jacks and Tens? Wait we have Jc, board has Tc and J\u2665, so we have Jacks pair, plus we have Ten from board, but we don't have Ten. So we have one pair (Jacks). Actually we have Jc and board J\u2665 => pair of Jacks. Also board has Ten, giving us Jacks over Ten kicker? Not two pair. So we have a pair of Jacks, which is top pair (since board has Ten). Opponent (Seat 1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 186. He called preflop, then called flop bet 6. So he likely has something like maybe a straight draw or a pair. On turn, board is 5s, which likely doesn't change much. Pot is 31 chips. We are in BB, after flop bet 6, opponent called, so pot 31 includes our 6 bet, his 6 call, plus previous preflop and blinds. Now it's our turn? Actually after flop, we bet 6, opponent called, then turn action: it's our turn? The sequence: preflop we raised, opponent called. Flop we bet, opponent called. Turn: we are first to act (since we were the aggressor preflop and flop). So we have amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 6 (so raise must be at least to 12 total? Actually raise to 6 means total? Usually minimum raise is bet + previous bet? But they say minimum raise to: 6. That likely means total amount you put in must be at least 6 more than current bet? But amount to call is 0, so raise must be at least 6 chips (so total bet 6). So we can bet 6 (which would be a continuation bet). We need to decide.\n\nOur hand: top pair Jacks, decent but board is fairly dry: T,3,J,5. No flush draws, no straight draws now (possible straight draws: 9-8? Not present). Opponent could have Ten, could have Ace? Actually Ace we have. He could have T9 for a straight? Not possible. He could have pocket tens (TT) for set? Actually board has one Ten, so TT would be set of tens. That would be strong. He could have J9 for two pair? Actually J9 would give him Jacks pair with nine kicker, same as us but we have Ace kicker, so we beat him. He could have AQ for top pair Ace? Not board. He could have KQ for straight? No.\n\nPotential opponent holdings: He called preflop raise of 8 from BB, so his range includes many hands: broadways, suited connectors, pairs, etc. He called flop bet of 6 on a board T3J. He could have a pair like TT, JJ, 99, etc. He could have a straight draw like Q9? Not on board. Could have a flush draw? No clubs? Board clubs: Tc, no other clubs. He could have clubs for flush draw? Only one club on board, need 2 more clubs. Not likely. So likely he has a hand like a pair, maybe a weak Ace, maybe a gutshot? Not many draws.\n\nOur hand is decent but vulnerable to TT set, or maybe a straight? Not possible. So we can consider betting for value, but also risk being raised by a set. Our stack is 197, opponent 186. Pot 31. If we bet 6, we risk being raised to larger amount. If we check, we give him free card, but could give him chance to improve.\n\nGiven top pair Jacks with Ace kicker, we want value but also protect against draws? No draws. So a small bet to get value from worse Jacks, Tens, lower pairs, maybe Ace high? He may call with Ace high? He might call a small bet with Ace high? Possibly. He could also raise with TT set.\n\nWhat is tournament context? Not given, but stack sizes moderate relative to blinds (1/2). 197 chips is ~98 BB, deep stack.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on river. Board: Tc 3d Jh 5s Th. So board is Ten of clubs, 3 diamonds, Jack hearts, 5 spades, Ten hearts. That's a full house? Actually we have two tens and a jack on board: Tens pair, Jack singleton. Board: T\u2663 3\u2666 J\u2665 5\u2660 T\u2665. So board is two pair (Tens and ??? Actually only tens pair, no other pair). So board is pair of tens. River is after turn? Wait actions listed: flop bet 6, call, turn bet 6, call. Now river action? It says amount to call 0, minimum raise 6, legal actions: fold, check, raise. So it's our turn on river, after turn betting, we are in BB. No one else acted on river yet. So we have Jc Ad. Our hand: Jc (Jack clubs) and Ace diamonds? Actually Ad is Ace diamonds. So we have Jc Ad. On board we have J\u2665 and T\u2663 T\u2665. So we have top pair (Jack) with Ace kicker? Actually we have a pair of Jacks (our Jc with board J\u2665) and also we have Ace high. So we have pair of Jacks, not a full house. Opponent (Seat1 Kimi) has unknown hand. They called preflop and both flop and turn bets. They may have a ten, maybe a jack, maybe a straight draw? Board: T,3,J,5,T. Possible hands: two pair tens+? maybe they have 10x for trips, or Jx for two pair Jacks+Tens? Actually board has two tens, one jack. If opponent has a jack, they'd have two pair (Jacks and Tens). If they have a ten, they'd have trips (three tens). If they have a straight? Board: T-3-J-5-T. Straight possibilities: 9-8-7-6-5? No. 8-9-10-J-Q? Need Q and 9. Not there. So no straight. Flush? No two clubs or hearts? Board has clubs T\u2663, hearts J\u2665, hearts T\u2665. Two hearts, one club. Opponent could have heart flush draw but not completed. So likely they have a ten (trips) or a jack (two pair). Could also have a 3 for a set? No, board only one 3. So set of 3s not possible. Could have a full house with a ten and a jack? If they have T? they'd have trips. If they have J? they'd have two pair. If they have Ace? they'd have Ace high, not likely call. They called both bets, suggests decent hand. Our hand Jc Ad is just a pair of Jacks, worse than two pair or trips. So we should probably fold unless we think they are bluffing. River bet? Actually we have amount to call 0, meaning no bet yet. So we can check or raise. If we think they will bet later, we could check and hope they bet? But they are the only other player. It's our turn, we can check to give them opportunity to bet. If we think they have a strong hand, we shouldn't raise. So likely check.\n\nBut could we consider raising as a bluff? Our hand is weak relative to board. Opponent may think we have a strong hand (like a ten) and we could bluff. But risk: they may call or raise. Our stack is 191, pot 43. Minimum raise is 6, so raise to 6? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Minimum raise to 6 means we need to put total 6? Actually we have already contributed previous bets? On river we haven't bet yet. So raising to 6 would be a bet of 6. That's small. Could be a thin bluff. But opponent may have a weak hand like missed draws, could call. But they called previous bets, so they likely have a decent hand. Probably best to check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Also we have Td, giving us a straight draw? Board: Js Jh 7h 2s. Our Td gives us a straight draw? The board has J J 7 2. With Td we have Ten, so we have Ten-Jack-Jack. That's a pair of Jacks plus a Ten kicker. Not a straight. Could we have a straight with 9? Not. So we have three of a kind (trips). That's a strong hand.\n\nOpponent (seat 3) checked the turn. So they likely have something like a Jack (but they'd have at least a pair maybe). They could have a hand like Jx, maybe a set of 7? Actually board has two Jacks. If opponent had a Jack, they'd have trips as well (maybe bigger kicker). But they could also have a flush draw? Board has hearts: Js, Jh, 7h, 2s. Two hearts on board. Our hand has no heart, so flush draw not possible for us. Opponent could have heart draw like Ah Kh. They would have missed the flop but have flush draw (two hearts on board, need two more hearts). Actually they need 2 hearts in hand to have a flush draw (two hearts on board, need 3 more hearts). With only two hearts on board, you need two hearts in hand to have a flush draw (nut flush draw). So maybe they have Ah Kh, they'd have a gutshot? Not.\n\nGiven opponent's actions: preflop they called our raise 6 (they had 2 big blind). So they called 4 (they posted 2, then call 4). On flop they checked to us, we bet 8, they called. So they have some hand but not strong enough to raise. Turn they checked again. So they likely have a middle pair, maybe a Jack with weak kicker, or a pair of 7s, or a straight draw? The board is paired Jacks, so many hands are dead. Our trips are likely best.\n\nPot size: 29 chips before turn action? Actually after flop betting: pot was 29 after flop? Let's compute: preflop: we raised to 6, they called 4 (since they already had 2 blind?), Actually preflop: seat 2 posted SB 1, seat 3 posted BB 2, seat 4 folded, seat 5 raise 6 (so raise to 6 total). So seat 2 folded, seat 3 call 4 (since they already have 2, need 4 more). So pot after preflop: 1+2+6+4 = 13? Wait seat 5 raise 6 means they put 6 total, not additional. So seat 5 contributed 6. Seat 3 contributed 2 (bb) + 4 call = 6 total. SB folded. So pot = 6+6 =12? plus maybe other blinds? Actually SB 1 folded, so not in pot. So pot = 12. Then flop: seat 3 check, seat5 bet 8, seat3 call 8. So pot adds 8+8 =16, total pot = 28. But given pot listed as 29 after flop? maybe rounding. Anyway.\n\nNow turn: seat3 check, amount to call 0. Minimum raise to 8. So we can check or raise. If we check, we give free card. Board: Js Jh 7h 2s, turn is unknown (the turn card just came, we are at turn action). Actually board includes turn card already: Js Jh 7h 2s (that's 4 cards). So we are acting after turn card is dealt. So we have trips. The opponent checked. Should we bet? Likely yes to protect against straight draws? Are there any straight draws? Board: J J 7 2. Possible straight draws: 8-9-10? Actually need 5 consecutive cards. With J,J,7,2, you could have a straight with 8-9-10? No, you need 5 cards: e.g., 8-9-10-J-J? That's not a straight because you need distinct ranks. So possible straight draw: 9-10-J-Q-K? Not possible with board. So there are no real straight draws. However there could be a flush draw if two hearts on board, need two hearts in hand.

Wait board has Js and Jh (two Jacks). Our hand is Td Jc, so we have third Jack? No, we have Jc, so we have three Jacks (trips). Actually board has two Jacks, we have one more Jack, so we have three of a kind (trip Jacks). Also board has a flush draw? Board suits: Js (spades), Jh (hearts), 7h (hearts), 2s (spades), 5s (spades). So three spades on board: Js, 2s,5s. That's a flush draw possible for opponent if they have two spades. Also straight draws? Board: J,J,7,2,5. No straight possibilities. So we have trips Jacks. Opponent (Seat 3, DeepSeek-V3.2) has been checking both flop and turn, calling our bets of 8 each. So they called 8 on flop, 8 on turn, now check river. Their range? They called 8 on flop after we bet 8 into pot 45? Let's compute pot sizes: Preflop: we raised to 6 (BB). Opponent called 4 (so they had 2 in BB, then call 4). So pot after preflop: 6 (our raise) + 4 (call) + 1 (SB) + 2 (BB) = 13? Actually SB posted 1, BB posted 2 (post_bb). Then raise to 6 means we put total 6? Typically raise to 6 means we put 6 total, so we added 4 more after BB's 2. So total contributions: SB 1, BB 6 (including 2), Opponent 4, total = 11. But pot listed as 45 after flop and turn bets? Anyway.\n\nOpponent's actions: check flop, we bet 8, they call 8. Turn: they check, we bet 8, they call 8. So they are calling small bets. Could be they have a hand like a Jack (but they'd have 4 Jacks? Actually only 2 Jacks left; they could have Jx). Could be they have a flush draw (spades) and call. Could be they have a pair of something like 7s, 5s, etc. Could be they have a straight draw? Not likely.\n\nNow river: they check. We can check or raise. Should we value bet? Our trips are strong but board has possible flush (spades) and also possible full house? Actually board: Js Jh 7h 2s 5s. If opponent has a heart flush? Hearts: Jh and 7h only two hearts, need two hearts. Not possible. Spade flush: Js,2s,5s three spades, need two more spades in hand. Could be they have spade flush, they'd have made flush on river if they have two spades. They could have also have a full house: e.g., 7-7 or 5-5 gives full house sevens over Jacks? Actually board has pair Jacks, so if opponent has a 7, they'd have two pair (Jacks and sevens) not full house. Full house would be if they have a Jack (but we have the third Jack, only two left). They could have a 7 or 5 to make trips of those ranks? Not enough board. So best possible opponent hand: flush (spades) or maybe two pair with Jacks and something else. Or maybe a straight? Not possible. So our trips likely best.\n\nWe can consider raising for value. What is stack sizes? Opponent stack unknown but they have 167 chips. Pot is 45 chips. If we raise to say 30-40 we could get value. But opponent may call with weaker hands like Jx (but they'd have at least one Jack, but we have three Jacks, they could have a Jack making quads? Actually there are four Jacks total: Js, Jh on board, Jc in our hand, and the remaining Jack is Jd. If opponent has Jd, they'd have four of a kind (Jacks). That's a monster hand that beats us. So they could have quads. If they have Jd, they'd likely have called earlier. They would have a very strong hand. If they have Jd, they'd likely raise or call? They called our bets, okay.\n\nIf they have a spade flush, they'd call our bets as well. On river, they check, maybe they think we have trips and they have flush, they might check. If we"

Both checked. Turn is 9s. Pot is 13 chips. It's our turn? Actually actions list: flop check by us then opponent. Now turn: we have action? The description says \"TURN\". So we are to act now. Opponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) is remaining with 115 chips. No bets yet on turn, amount to call is 0. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 4.\n\nWe have pocket sevens, board QJ39. No pair, no straight draw? We have a gutshot? The board: Q J 3 9. Straight possibilities: 8-10? Actually we have 7s, we could have a straight draw if a 8 appears (8 would give 9-10-J-Q? Wait need 5 consecutive. Current board: Q J 3 9. No consecutive. If a 8 appears, we would have 7-8-9-10-J? But we lack 10. So no. If a 10 appears, we have 9-10-J-Q, missing J? Actually we have J on board, Q, so 10 would give us J-10-9? Not a straight. So no straight draws. Flush? Two diamonds on board, we have clubs and spades, no flush draw.\n\nThus our hand is just a middle pair (sevens) which is likely weak. Opponent's range: preflop raise to 6 from UTG? Actually seat 3 raised 6 from position? We don't know seat positions, but seat 3 is likely UTG or MP. He raised preflop, we called. So his range is fairly strong: broadway cards, pairs, suited connectors, etc. Flop QJ3 is favorable to many of those. He checked flop. Could be weak or drawing. Turn 9 is also a card that could give him straight draws (like 10-8). He may bet now. Should we check and see? Our stack is large relative to pot (296 chips, pot 13). We can check, but risk losing later. Better to check and evaluate river. If opponent bets, we can decide to call or fold. Our hand is likely not best. So checking is safe.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nWe need JSON: action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 6 into pot 19, after checking on flop. So they are betting on turn. What could they have? Could be a made hand like QJ (two pair), maybe a set? No set possible because board has no pair. Could be a straight draw: they have T9? Actually board has 9 now, so T9 would give pair of 9s? Actually they would have a pair of 9s if they hold 9x. But 9 on board, they could have 9x for trips? No board only one 9. So they'd have pair of 9s if they have another 9. Could be a combo draw like J10 (open-ended straight draw: J-10-9-8-7). Board: Q J 3 9. With J10 you have pair of J and open-ended? Actually J10 would give pair of J and also straight draw? Need 8? J10 gives J-J? Actually J is on board, you have pair of J. Straight draw: 10-8? Not. Let's think: board: Q J 3 9. To have open-ended you need 10 and 8 for 8-9-10-J-Q straight. So a hand like 10-8 would be open-ended. Also a hand like K10 would give gutshot? K10 gives Q-J-10? Actually need 10-J-Q-K-A? Not. So many possibilities.\n\nOur hand: pocket 7s is weak. Likely we should fold. But consider stack sizes: we have 296 chips, opponent 109 chips. Opponent is short stack; they bet 6 (small relative to pot). Pot 19, bet 6, pot would be 25 if we call. Our stack is large, but opponent is short; they could be trying to steal blinds? They are in seat 3 (UTG? Actually seat 3 after seat 4 folded, seat 5 is BB). Preflop: seat 3 raised to 6 (so they are the raiser). So they are the aggressor preflop, and they checked flop, bet turn. Likely they have a hand like QJ (two pair), maybe a set? No set. Could be a pair of J, Q, or 9, or a straight draw, or a bluff. But with pocket 7s, we have low showdown value. Should we call? Pot odds: need 6 to win 25 (if call) => 6/25 = 24% equity needed. Our hand vs unknown? Probably less. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

Consider stack sizes: we have 289, opponent 196. Pot 13. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to 4 total? Actually raise_to is total amount. Minimum raise is 4, meaning we need to put total 4 chips? But we already have 6 in pot? Actually we are acting after flop check, no bet. So to bet, we need to raise to at least 4 chips total (i.e., bet 4). That's a small bet relative to pot (13). Might be okay as a continuation bet to build pot and apply pressure. Opponent is unknown but earlier folds many times, raised once preflop (hand unknown). Could be tight? Not much data. With open-ended straight draw, a bet of around half pot (~6-7) could be good. Minimum raise is 4, we can raise to 8 maybe? But must be at least 4. Our stack is deep, can bet larger. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. No bet action; raise acts as bet. So we could raise to 8 (i.e., bet 8). Pot 13, bet 8 = ~0.6 pot. That seems decent. Opponent may call with overpairs (9, 6, 5) or draws. Our equity vs random hand is about 30%? Actually with open-ended straight draw, about 31% to hit by river, plus some equity now. Might be okay to bet.\n\nConsider tournament: we have 144 BB, deep. No need to preserve chips heavily. So we can be aggressive.\n\nThus choose raise to 8.

Wait we don't have 8. We have 10 and queen. The board has 5,6,7,9. So we have 10, queen, plus board 5,6,7,9. Straight possibilities: 6-7-8-9-10 would need 8; 5-6-7-8-9 would need 8; also we have gutshot? Actually we have 10, queen, board 5,6,7,9. We have a gutshot draw to a straight? Let's enumerate combos: If a 8 appears, we have 5-6-7-8-9 straight (8 on board). If a Jack appears, we have 6-7-8-9-10? Wait we need 8 for that straight, not J. Actually 6-7-8-9-10 requires 8. So only 8 completes straight. Also a 8 would give us straight; also a queen? Already have queen; queen doesn't help. So we have an open-ended straight draw? Actually we have 5-6-7-9, we have 10, so we have 6-7-8-9-10 missing 8; we also have 5-6-7-8-9 missing 8. So yes we have a gutshot? No, it's an open-ended? Let's think: The straight draw is \"inside\" because only 8 works, not 4 or J. So it's a gutshot (inside) draw: need exactly one rank (8). So probability of hitting on river: 4 outs (four 8s) out of unseen cards. Unknown cards: total deck 52, we have 2, board 4 =6 known. Opponent unknown cards 2? Actually opponent has 2 unknown. So 52-6=46 unknown, 4 outs => ~8.7% chance.\n\nWe also have backdoor flush draw? Board has two diamonds: 6d,7d, our hand has Td Qd both diamonds, so we have a flush draw? Actually we have two diamonds in hand, board has two diamonds, so we have four diamonds total. Need one more diamond on river to make flush. So we have 9 diamonds total in deck (13 total diamonds - 4 we know =9). Opponent may have some diamonds but we consider unknown. So flush draw outs: 9 - opponent's possible diamonds (maybe 0-2). Approx 9 outs, ~19.5% chance.\n\nThus we have combined outs: straight 4, flush 9 (some overlap? 8 of diamonds also counts as straight? 8d is both straight and flush, counted twice. So total unique outs = 4 (8s) + 9 (diamonds) - 1 (8d) =12 outs. So about 12/46 = 26% chance to improve to strong hand.\n\nCurrent pot: 29 chips.

Actually amount to call is 0, so raise_to = 8 means we bet 8 chips total? That seems low relative to pot. Probably raise to 8 means we bet 8 chips. So we can bet 8.\n\nGiven pot 29, a bet of 8 is about 0.28 pot, small. Might not be enough to fold out draws. But it's a turn, could be okay.\n\nWe could also check and see river. Since we have ~26% equity and pot 29, expected value of checking: if opponent checks and we get to river, we can bet or check. Might be okay.\n\nBut maybe we should raise to 12 or 14? Minimum raise is 8; we could raise more? The raise_to is total amount; we could raise to any amount above min? Usually you can raise to any amount up to stack. But we need to know allowed raise amounts. Since min raise is 8, we could raise to say 20. But we don't know if allowed. We can choose raise_to 20.\n\nGiven opponent's stack 188, they could call. A raise of 20 would be 20 into 29 pot, ~0.7 pot, decent pressure.\n\nOur hand is a draw, not a made hand; semi-bluff is appropriate. I'd raise to 20 to charge draws and possibly win now.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 20.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Action history: Seat2 post_sb 1 (small blind). Seat3 post_bb 2 (big blind). Seat4 fold. Seat5 (us) raise 8 (to 8 total? Actually raise to 8 means we put 8 total? In BB we posted 2, then raise to 8 meaning we add 6). Seat1 call 8. Seat2 raise 24 (so they re-raise to 24). Seat3 fold. So now amount to call is 16 (since we have 8 in, they raised to 24, we need to put 16 more). Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise at least to 40 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: 9dTd is a decent hand but not premium. In BB, facing a 3-bet (raise after our raise). Our raise was only to 8 (small). Opponent seat2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 24. That's a 3-bet of 24 total (i.e., 12 more after our 8). So they 3-bet fairly large relative to stack (24 is 12x big blind). They could be a strong hand. Our hand 9T is suited? No it's offsuit. So not great.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: we saw they raised to 6 previously (hand #7). That's a small raise preflop, maybe they are loose? Not enough data. Could be they 3-bet with a wide range. But 9T off is a decent blocker for broadway combos. However stack depth 151 BB, tournament early stage, we should preserve chips. 9T offsuit is not strong enough to call a 3-bet out of position (BB) vs unknown opponent. Better to fold.\n\nCheck pot odds: To call 16 to win pot of currently? Pot before call includes: blinds 1+2 =3, our raise 8 (but we already have 8 in), seat1 call 8, seat2 raise to 24 (so they added 16). So pot currently is 42 (as given). If we call 16, pot becomes 58, we would have 58 pot for 16 call = 27.6% equity needed. 9T offsuit vs unknown range maybe ~20% equity. So not profitable.\n\nThus fold.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

Considering opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 raised preflop in previous hands sometimes (6, 24, 6). So they may be raising with a range perhaps wide? But we have 2 opponents with short stacks; we could try to steal blinds with a raise. However Qc7c is not a premium hand. In BTN, raise to 4 (minimum) is a standard steal. The big blind may call or 3-bet. But given short stacks, they might shove if they have decent hand. But we have 151 BB, can afford to call a raise of 4 and see flop.\n\nWe could also just call to see flop cheap, but raise may get folds and win blinds. Qc7c has some flush and straight potential. In tournament, stealing blinds is important. I'd raise to 4 (minimum). Reasoning: position, decent suited, steal attempt.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 4.\n\n",

Straight draw: we have 8-9, we need 7 or 10 for straight. We have no 7 or 10. So only flush draw.\n\nOpponent DeepSeek-V3.2 is in UTG? Actually seat 3. Preflop they called 2. So they have some hand maybe suited connectors, etc. On flop, we need to see actions. So far only we have checked, opponent hasn't acted yet. It's our turn? Actually actions: preflop: seat 3 call 2, seat 5 check. So flop action order: seat 3 first (UTG) then seat 5 (BB). Since we are BB, we act after them. The flop hasn't been acted yet? The listing only shows preflop actions. It says \"=== Hand #18 - FLOP ===\". So we need to decide our action now, but we need to know opponent's flop action. The actions list maybe incomplete; they only list preflop actions. So now it's our turn on flop, with amount to call 0 (meaning opponent checked). So opponent must have checked. So we have the option to check or bet (raise). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot call because no bet. So we can check or bet.\n\nWe have a flush draw with decent equity (~35%?). Pot is 5 chips. We have 303 stack, deep. Should we bet? Consider opponent's tendencies unknown. Could be a weak hand like low pair, maybe 8x, 9x, etc. A bet could take pot. But we also could check to see turn cheap. With deep stacks, maybe we want to see turn cheap to get implied odds. However we are out of position (we are BB but after opponent's check, we are first to act? Actually we are last to act preflop, but on flop opponent checked, we are next. So we are in position? In flop, after opponent checks, we are last to act, so we have position. So we can bet.\n\nGiven we have a strong draw, betting could be good to build pot and also get fold equity. But also we could check to see if opponent bets turn. I think betting is good: maybe bet 2/3 pot (~3 chips). Minimum raise is 2, so we could raise to 2? Actually raise to total amount. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 2 means we bet 2 chips. That is a small bet ~40% pot. Could be good.\n\nConsider stack depth: deep, we could also raise more, but keep small to keep implied odds. So raise to 2.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 2, reasoning.\n\n"

Straight draw: we have 8-9, we need 7 or 10 for straight. We have no 7 or 10. So only flush draw.\n\nOpponent DeepSeek-V3.2 is in UTG? Actually seat 3. Preflop they called 2. So they have some hand maybe suited connectors, etc. On flop, we need to see actions. So far only we have checked, opponent hasn't acted yet. It's our turn? Actually actions: preflop: seat 3 call 2, seat 5 check. So flop action order: seat 3 first (UTG) then seat 5 (BB). Since we are BB, we act after them. The flop hasn't been acted yet? The listing only shows preflop actions. It says \"=== Hand #18 - FLOP ===\". So we need to decide our action now, but we need to know opponent's flop action. The actions list maybe incomplete; they only list preflop actions. So now it's our turn on flop, with amount to call 0 (meaning opponent checked). So opponent must have checked. So we have the option to check or bet (raise). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot call because no bet. So we can check or bet.\n\nWe have a flush draw with decent equity (~35%?). Pot is 5 chips. We have 303 stack, deep. Should we bet? Consider opponent's tendencies unknown. Could be a weak hand like low pair, maybe 8x, 9x, etc. A bet could take pot. But we also could check to see turn cheap. With deep stacks, maybe we want to see turn cheap to get implied odds. However we are out of position (we are BB but after opponent's check, we are first to act? Actually we are last to act preflop, but on flop opponent checked, we are next. So we are in position? In flop, after opponent checks, we are last to act, so we have position. So we can bet.\n\nGiven we have a strong draw, betting could be good to build pot and also get fold equity. But also we could check to see if opponent bets turn. I think betting is good: maybe bet 2/3 pot (~3 chips). Minimum raise is 2, so we could raise to 2? Actually raise to total amount. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 2 means we bet 2 chips. That is a small bet ~40% pot. Could be good.\n\nConsider stack depth: deep, we could also raise more, but keep small to keep implied odds. So raise to 2.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 2, reasoning.\n\n",

Hearts: we have Qh and 3h, board has 8h and 2h, so we have a flush draw with 9 outs (any heart except Qh,3h,8h,2h). Also we have a gutshot? Straight possibilities: board 8-9-2-2, we have Q and 3, not relevant.\n\nWe have top pair? No pair. We have backdoor flush. Pot size 9 chips. Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) in seat 3 is the only other player. Preflop they called 2, flop they called 2 after we bet 2. So they have called our flop bet. Now turn action: we are BB, we acted first? Actually order: after flop betting, we bet 2, they called. Turn now: we are first to act (since we are BB). The actions list shows only \"Amount to call: 0\". So we can check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. There's no bet to call.\n\nWe need to decide based on opponent tendencies. We recall opponent's turn bet history: they bet 6 on turn in hand #8. That suggests they may be aggressive, perhaps they bet when they have made hand. In this hand, we have a flush draw. Should we bet? We could raise (i.e., bet). Minimum raise to 2 (so raise to 2? Actually raise_to is total amount; currently amount to call 0, so raise to 2 is a bet of 2). That's small relative to pot 9. Pot odds: if we bet 2, opponent must call 2 to win pot ~11. That's good if they call with weaker hands.\n\nBut opponent may bet on turn when they have a made hand; they might also call a bet. We don't know their range. Preflop they called 2, could have any hand. Flop board: 8h 2h 9s. They called our flop bet of 2. Could have hearts, pair, straight draw, etc.\n\nOur hand: Qh3h gives us nut flush draw (any heart gives us flush, Qh is highest heart). Also we have overcards but not pair.\n\nWe have 9 outs for flush (any heart except those known: Qh,3h,8h,2h). That's 9 outs. Also maybe a straight draw? Not really.\n\nTurn card is unknown; currently board: 8h 2h 9s 2s. Turn is unknown? Actually board shows turn is 2s? Wait board shows 8h 2h 9s 2s. So turn is 2s (a second 2). So board now is paired 2s. That gives us potential full house possibilities for opponent if they have a 2.\n\nWe have no pair, but we have flush draw.\n\nWe need to decide whether to bet or check. If we bet, we could represent a made hand (e.g., a 2 for full house) and maybe get fold equity. Opponent's previous turn bet of 6 suggests they bet when they have a made hand. So they might bet now if they have a 2, a set, two pair, etc. We could raise to maybe 4-5 to protect? But we only have 301 chips, pot small. Minimum raise to 2 is small; we could raise to 5 maybe? Not sure about max raise. No max given; but we must be within stack.\n\nWe should consider tournament stage: 301 chips, blinds 1/2, effective stack 150 BB, deep. We can afford a small raise.\n\nGiven we have a strong draw, we could bet for value and fold equity. Opponent may call with weaker pairs or draws. So I think we should raise (bet) to maybe 5 chips (total). But need to ensure it's legal: raise to any amount >= min raise (2). So raise_to 5.\n\nReasoning: we have nut flush draw, want to build pot, opponent likely has a hand like a pair or 2, but we want to protect against giving them free card (river). Also we could get them to fold if they have medium hand.\n\nThus action: raise to 5.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Could also limp to see flop cheap, but raising can pick up blinds. Usually raise to about 3x BB = 6, but min raise is 4, we could raise to 6 or more. Legal actions only fold, call, raise. Should we raise? Yes, raise to 6 maybe. Need to consider that they could shove if we raise, but they have 178 chips, 89 BB, they'd likely call or shove all-in if raise is big. Raising to 6 is small relative to their stacks, they might call. But we want to isolate and maybe get action. 9-8 suited has good equity vs random hands. So raise.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 6.

So the raise to 12 is from seat2, meaning they raised to 12 total. Our contribution is 2 (SB) + we haven't posted BB (since we are SB). Actually we are SB, so we posted 2. The BB posted 4. So the raise to 12 is from seat2, we need to call additional 10? Let's compute: current pot includes SB 2, BB 4, raise to 12 from seat2 (so they put 12). So total contributions: SB 2, BB 4, seat2 12 = 18. Our amount to call is 12 - 2 = 10? But the prompt says amount to call: 8. So maybe they consider that we are the BB? Wait seat5 is SB, seat5 posted SB 2, seat5 also posted BB 4? That seems weird. Actually the actions: preflop: Seat 4 post_sb 2 (that's seat4, but seat4 is MiniMax-M2 folded later). Then preflop: Seat 5 post_bb 4. So seat4 posted SB 2, seat5 posted BB 4. So we are BB, not SB. The Position line says SB (Seat5) but the actions indicate seat5 is BB. There's inconsistency. Probably position is SB, seat5 posted BB incorrectly. But amount to call is 8, min raise 20. So we need to call 8 to match raise to 12 (since we have 4 in pot as BB). So we have Kd8d, a weak hand. Opponent seat2 raised to 12 from UTG? Not sure.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call, raise. K8 suited is not strong enough for a 3-bet in early position against unknown. Stack 308, we have 77 BB, deep.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #24 preflop. Position: SB, we posted 2. BB posted 4. Player in Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8 (so raise of 4 from BB? Actually they raised 8 total, which is 4 over BB? Wait: blinds 2/4, SB posted 2, BB posted 4, then MiniMax-M2 (Seat4) raised 8, meaning they put 8 total (i.e., 4 raise). So amount to call is 6 (since we have 2 posted, need to put total 8, so 6 more). Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise at least to 12 total). Our hand: Ah Ts (Ace Ten suited). Stack 306 chips, 76.5 BB. We are in SB, out of position post-flop.\n\nWe need to decide fold, call, raise.\n\nConsider hand strength: Ace Ten suited is a decent hand, especially in early position? In SB, but out of position. In tournament with 76 BB, still deep. Facing a raise from MP? Actually seat4 maybe MP? Not sure. Opponent's tendencies: we saw MiniMax-M2 raised preflop 4 (small raise) in hand 19. Also raised on flop 8 in hand 9. Not much data. Could be a loose raiser.\n\nWe have 6 to call, pot is 14 (2+4+8). Effective stack after call: 306-6 = 300 left, still deep. Ace Ten suited has good equity vs random raise (~35% vs a random 2-5 range). If opponent is raising a wide range, we could call and see flop. Raising could be to isolate and get value if they are weaker. Minimum raise to 12 would be 12 total, i.e., raise additional 4 (since we need to put 12 total). That would be a 4 raise over call (so 6 to call + 4 = 10 extra). Actually raise_to is total amount we put in: currently we have posted 2, need to put 12 total, so need 10 more chips. That's a raise of 10? Wait: legal raise to 12 means total bet after raise is 12. Since we already have 2 posted, we need to put 10 more. That would be a raise of 4 over call (call 6, raise extra 4). So raise to 12 is small. Could also go all-in but not needed.\n\nGiven deep stack, raising could isolate and build pot with a strong hand. Ace Ten suited can make top pair, straight, flush. But also can be dominated by AK, AQ, etc. In SB, out of position, raising may be okay to take initiative.\n\nBut opponent's raise size is small (8 total). This could be a steal attempt from MP. If we raise, we could push them out or get heads-up. Our hand is decent but not premium. Many players would just call or fold. Considering tournament, preserving stack is okay. With 76 BB, we can afford to call.\n\nThus best action: call. Reason: decent hand, deep stack, want to see flop, out of position, small raise, opponent likely wide, we can see cheap flop.\n\nThus output JSON.",

Suits: Ah (hearts), Ts (spades). Board hearts: Jd, 9h, 6c. One heart on board (9h). So we have backdoor flush draw (need two hearts). Not strong.\n\nMiniMax-M2 raised preflop to 8 (from BB).

Since call is 0, minimum raise to 4? The legal raise amount is total 4? Usually raise must be at least double the previous bet, but here no bet, so min bet is big blind amount? It says Minimum raise to: 4. So we could bet 4 chips.\n\nShould we bet as a continuation? Our hand has no equity, but we could try to steal pot.

On BTN, standard raise is 3x BB = 12. Minimum raise to 8 is low; raising to 12 is typical. Could also raise to 10 (2.5x). Considering opponents may call or 3-bet. Our stack 300, deep enough.\n\nGiven both opponents have shown willingness to raise, but we are first to act after them? Actually preflop order: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, then seat4 folded, then it's BTN (us). So both blinds are posted, no raises yet. So we can open raise. Opponents may call or re-raise.\n\nGiven hand strength moderate, I think we should raise to 12 (3x BB) to build pot and isolate.

No. So only pair of J? Not on board. So we have just J high, no made hand. Board pairs 6s, 6d. Opponent (Seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking) bet 24 on turn. Then Seat2 Kimi-K2 raised to 72 (all-in?

Then raise to 72 means he is raising to 72 total? Actually amount to call is 72 (the raise). Minimum raise to 120. So raise to 72 is a call? Wait legal actions: fold, call, raise. Amount to call: 72. Minimum raise to: 120. So the opponent raised to 72 (i.e., he put 72 total into pot?), meaning the bet is now 72? Actually we have to call 72 to match his raise.

Board has two spades (6s, Qs). We have Js (spade). That's three spades, need two more for flush. Not there. So opponent could have a spade flush draw like As, Ks, etc. Or a set of 6s? Actually set of 6s would be 6x. Could have 6c or 6h. That's a set. Could have Q9 for two pair? Or Q9 is two pair (Q and 9). Could have Q9? Actually board has Q and 9. So Q9 would be two pair (Q's and 9's). Could have Q9 combos. Could have a straight: 7-8-10? Not. Could have a straight draw like 7-8. Could have a pair of Qs?

Both seem to raise occasionally, maybe they are aggressive. Our hand 9s4s is weak, suited but low. On button we could attempt a steal, but both opponents have stacks: SB 258, BB 151. SB is shortish but still decent. BB is shorter (151). Our stack is 282 (70 BB). Raising might be okay to steal blinds, but 9-4 suited is not great for post-flop play if called. Considering opponent tendencies: both have raised preflop sometimes, maybe they are not tight. However they are in blind positions; they may defend. The SB has raised 4 (minimum) once, but more often 12. The BB has raised 6 (min) and 12 and 24. So they may be raising with a range including weak hands. But we are on button with a weak hand; a standard play is to raise to steal, but risk being called by a defender with better hand. Since we have 70 BB, we can risk a small raise to try to take blinds. Minimum raise is 8 (total). Could raise to 12 or 15. But we should consider stack sizes: BB 151, if we raise to 12, BB might call with any decent hand. However if we raise to 12, pot will be 6+4+12? Actually call amount is 4, raise to 8 min, but raise total of 8 means we add 4 more (since call 4). Usually raise to 8 total (i.e., 8 chips in our stack). That is small. Could raise to 12 (total). Let's consider pot odds: If called, we are out of position post-flop. Our hand's equity is low. Better to fold.\n\nThus likely fold.\n\nWe'll output fold.",

With AA, we want to isolate, build pot. Stack is deep, but we can raise to 12-14 maybe. However, need to consider opponent tendencies. Let's recall opponent seat2 and seat4.

So we face a BB of 4, and SB already posted 2 (but SB is seat1? Actually seat1 posted SB 2, seat2 BB 4). So we are to act after BB? In typical order, SB acts first preflop, then BB, then BTN. Here SB posted 2 (no action yet?), but the actions list only shows SB post_sb 2, BB post_bb 4, seat4 fold. So no raises yet. So we are to act on BTN, amount to call 4 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise total to 8). Hand is Q6 suited. This is a weak hand. In BTN, we could raise to steal, but Q6 suited is not a strong stealing hand; but still many players fold to raises from BTN. However opponents are Kimi-K2 (seat1 SB) and seat2 BB. Both have short stacks (258 and 147). They may be willing to call with many hands. Our stack is 72 BB, deep. We could consider raising to isolate BB? But Q6 suited is not great for 3-betting. Better to just call and see flop? But calling 4 into a pot of 6 (plus SB 2) gives us pot odds? After calling, pot will be 10 (2+4+4). Actually we call 4, pot becomes 2+4+4 =10. Our chance to improve? Q6 suited has some equity vs random range. But we are out of position after flop (SB first, then BB). Might be better to fold.\n\nGiven typical strategy: Q6s is a marginal hand. In BTN, you could raise to steal if opponents are tight. But we have info: Kimi-K2's raise amounts: they raised 6, 24, 6, 12 etc. They seem to raise moderate amounts preflop, perhaps indicating they open-raise from SB or BB? Actually they are SB (seat1) and BB (seat2). The raises recorded are from seat2 (BB) maybe. Not sure. But they raise often, maybe they are aggressive. So raising may get a re-raise or call.\n\nThus folding seems prudent.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nI'll fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have AKc in BB, small blind posted 2, big blind posted 4. Opponent in seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB 4? Wait seat1 is SB? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 posted SB 2, seat5 posted BB 4. So opponent is SB? Actually seat1 is SB (post_sb 2). So seat1 is SB with 266 chips, they posted 2. They haven't acted yet? The actions list shows seat5 post_sb 2 (that's us? Wait seat5 is BB, but they posted sb? Might be mis labeling). Actually seat5 is BB but they posted sb 2? Might be a mistake. Anyway we have amount to call 2 (the SB). So opponent in SB likely raised? No they haven't acted; amount to call 2 suggests we need to call the SB's 2 (they posted). So it's our turn after SB posted? Actually order: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, then action proceeds to UTG etc but only two players left: SB and BB. SB already posted, BB posted, now SB acts first preflop. But action list shows only posts, no raises. So SB hasn't acted yet, it's now SB's turn? But amount to call is 2, meaning SB must act, but we are BB. Wait we are BB, we act after SB. So SB's action would be either call (check) or raise. Since amount to call is 2, that is the amount we would need to call if SB raised to 6? Actually the minimum raise is 8 (total). So amount to call is 2 meaning the SB has not raised, they just posted blind. So it's our turn to act, we can check (i.e., just call 0) because we are BB and can check the blind? In NLHE, after blinds, the action starts with player left of BB (SB). Since SB posted blind, they act first; they can check (i.e., just call the blind) or raise. But the action list doesn't show SB's action, so maybe it's our turn because SB checked? Actually if SB checks, the action goes to BB who can check (i.e., just see flop) or raise. The amount to call is 2 (the SB's blind) meaning we need to call 2 to match SB's blind if we want to see flop. So we have the option to call 2, raise to at least 8, or fold (but folding loses 4). So we have AKc, strong hand. We should raise. Consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking raises preflop to 12 often (based on recall). So they are aggressive. But they haven't acted yet; they posted SB 2, could raise. If they raise, they'd likely raise to 12 (3x BB). So we can re-raise (3-bet) to maybe 30? Our stack is 288, we can do a decent 3-bet. Since they are aggressive, we want to isolate. A typical 3-bet size from BB vs SB is 3-4x the raise. If they raise to 12, 3-bet to ~30-36. Minimum raise is 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total). We could raise to 12 to just call? Actually raise to 12 would be a call? No raise to 12 means total bet 12, which is a 3-bet if they raised to 12. But they haven't raised yet. So we are raising to 12 (i.e., 3-bet) as a standard open raise from BB? Usually BB open raise size is 2.5-3x BB (i.e., 10-12). So raise to 12 is fine.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 12. Reasoning: strong AK, isolate aggressive SB, build pot.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Both have relatively short stacks, especially BB with 109 chips (~13.6 BB). Our hand K5 offsuit. In BTN, typical play: raise or call? With K5 offsuit, it's marginal. Considering opponent stacks short, we could raise to isolate and maybe steal blinds. SB is 256 chips (~32 BB) also shortish. BB is 109 chips (~13.6 BB) maybe likely to call or go all-in? But our raise size minimum 16 (total). Usually raise to 2.5-3x BB = 20-24. Since we have 36 BB stack, can raise. But K5 off is not strong for 3-bet; but we can open raise standard. However we might consider that both opponents are short, and we want to avoid being called by BB who could go all-in. If we raise to 20, BB might call (8) and see flop with K5, not great. Might be better to just call 8 and see flop cheap? But calling from BTN is unusual; we are out of position after flop (SB and BB act first). So better to raise to try to win blinds. Given K5 suited? It's hearts, so 5h Kh, suited? Yes hearts, so K5 suited. Slightly better. So raise to 20 (total) maybe. Minimum raise is 16, but we can raise more. Choose raise to 20. Reasoning: attempt steal, hand decent suited king, short stacks, want to apply pressure.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise allowed. So output raise.\n\n",

Actually actions: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, MiniMax-M2 called 8. So pot is 4+8+8=20. It's our turn, amount to call 4 (to match BB's 8? Actually we are SB, we posted 4, BB posted 8, other player called 8, so to call we need to put in 4 more to match 8). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total bet 16). Opponents: seat 1 Kimi-K2 is BB with 357 chips, seat 4 MiniMax-M2 is calling 8 (so they have 313). We have 296.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength: 8s7s suited is a decent suited connector, especially in SB vs two opponents (BB and a caller). But it's a marginal hand, could be good for limping or raising. In tournaments, with 37 BB, we can be aggressive. However, we are out of position postflop (SB will be first to act after flop). The opponent in BB is Kimi-K2, who has shown occasional raises preflop (see raise amounts 12, 24, 232). So they can be aggressive. MiniMax-M2 has been calling often, occasional betting.\n\nGiven we are in SB with 8s7s, we could consider raising to isolate the BB or take down pot. With 2 opponents, raising can thin field. But we have a marginal hand; raising may get called by both, leading to out-of-position play.\n\nOption: Call (just add 4) and see flop. Pot would be 24. 8s7s suited can flop well (open-ended straight draw, flush draws). Stack depth moderate.\n\nCheck if we have any reason to fold: 8s7s is not a fold in SB with 37BB and only two opponents. So likely call.\n\nRaise? Minimum raise to 16, that's 8 more than call. Raising to 16 total would be 12 extra (since we already have 4 posted). That would be a 2x BB raise (BB 8). Could isolate. But if BB is aggressive, they might 3-bet. MiniMax-M2 may call.\n\nGiven our hand is suited connector, we prefer to see flop cheaply. So call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

We could check to see what happens, maybe get a free card or a cheap raise to steal? Raising could be a bluff to take pot, but we have limited equity. With 8s7s, we have some outs: 9 for straight (4 outs), plus spade flush draws: we have two spades, board has Qs, so we have 2 spades, board has one spade, so we have 2 spades in hand, one on board, need two more spades for flush, so backdoor flush: need spade on turn and river (2 outs each).

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop on BTN with Kd Qd, stack 292, blinds 4/8, pot 12. Opponent seat 1 (UTG? Actually seat 1 posted SB) is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 385 chips. Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2 BB with 297 chips. So we are BTN after SB and BB posted. Action to us: amount to call 8 (BB). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: recall opponent seat 1 raise patterns preflop: they raised 12 (i.e., to 12? Actually small blind 4, so raise to 12 means raise 8 more? That's a 3x BB raise). In hand 42 they raised to 24 (3x BB) and also a huge raise 232 (maybe all-in). So they can be aggressive, but also sometimes go all-in.\n\nSeat 4 (BB) hasn't acted yet preflop (they posted blind). No data.\n\nOur hand KQ suited is a strong hand, especially in position. Stack 36.5 BB, deep enough for standard raise.\n\nStandard play: raise to about 2.5-3x BB, maybe 20-24 chips. Considering we are BTN, can open raise to 24 (3x BB). That is above minimum raise 16, okay.\n\nPotentially consider 3-bet if we think seat 1 might raise later? Actually seat 1 already posted SB; they haven't acted yet. The action order: SB, BB, then BTN (us). So we are first to act after blinds. So we can raise.\n\nGiven KQ suited is top 10% hand, raise.\n\nStack depth: 292 chips, 36 BB, raising to 24 leaves 268, okay.\n\nThus decision: raise to 24 (or maybe 22). Let's pick 24.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

MiniMax-M2 (seat4) called 8, SB called 4, BB checked. So pot 24 (4+8+8+4). Flop: 8s 2h Kc. No bets yet; amount to call 0. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We are SB, first to act? Actually order after flop: SB first (seat5), then seat1 (BB), then seat4 (MP?). Actually seat4 is after seat1? The order is SB, BB, then UTG? But seat4 is MP maybe after BB. But currently only SB and BB and seat4 are still in. The flop is 8s 2h Kc. Our hand Ah 9c: we have Ace high, 9 kicker. No pair, no draw (straight draw? 8-9-10-J-Q? Not possible). No flush draw (two spades? we have Ah (heart) and 9c (club). Board has spade 8, heart 2, club K. So we have backdoor possibilities but weak.\n\nWe need to decide check or raise. Opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 has raised on flop before (hand 28 raised 40). That suggests they can be aggressive, maybe continuation bet. Kimi-K2 is BB, hasn't acted yet. Their raise pattern preflop is small raises (12) and occasional big (105). Not much flop data.\n\nGiven our weak hand, likely check. But consider possibility of a bluff raise? Our stack 300, pot 24. Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total? Actually raise to total amount; current bet is 0, so raise to 8 means bet 8). That's a small raise. Could be a steal attempt, but we are SB with weak hand. Opponents may call with any pair or better. Might be risky.\n\nBetter to check and see what BB does. If BB bets, we can consider folding.\n\nThus decision: check.\n\nWe need JSON.",

Board: 8,2,K,5. We have A,9. No pair. Potential draws: 9 gives gutshot to 10-J? Not. 9 could make a pair if a 9 hits later. No flush draw (two spades? we have Ah,9c; board has spade 8, others none). So essentially just Ace high.\n\nOpponent seats: Seat 1 Kimi-K2 with 377 chips, seat 4 MiniMax-M2 with 285 chips. Both still in. Preflop: Seat 5 (us) posted SB 4, seat 1 posted BB 8, seat4 called 8, seat5 called 4 (so we just called SB). Then seat1 checked, flop check all around. So pot 24 chips after flop (4+8+8+4?

Not sure but actions: we are seat5 (SB). After flop checks, it's turn, and actions order: seat5 first (SB), then seat1, then seat4? Usually order is from SB clockwise. So we act first.\n\nWe have Ace high, not strong. Opponents have larger stacks (377, 285). We have 300. Likely they have stronger hands (maybe pair, two pair, etc). Should we check and see what they do? If we check and they bet, we may have to fold. Could we raise as a bluff? Our stack 300, pot 24, raise to at least 8 (minimum). Could try a small raise to take pot. But with Ace high, risk.\n\nConsider tournament stage: we have 37.5 BB, decent stack. Should preserve chips.

But need more context: maybe they are tight? The bet of 16 is relatively small, could be value bet with K, maybe a bluff? But given board, they might have Kx, maybe a pair of K? Actually board has Kc, so they could have Kx for top pair. A small bet could be a probe. Our hand is weak, likely fold.\n\nPot odds: To call 16 to win pot ~56+16=72?

Actually raise to 16 means total put in 16, so raise amount = 8 (since call is 8). So raise to 16 is a small raise.\n\nWe should consider opponent tendencies: recall shows MiniMax-M2 raised preflop twice: hand 19 raise amount 4 (that's weird, maybe a min raise? maybe they were in SB? Actually seat4 is BB, raise of 4? Could be a re-raise? Not sure). Hand24 raise amount 8 (maybe a standard raise). Not enough data. Likely they raise with a wide range from BB? Could be they defend loosely.\n\nGiven J8 off, typical strategy: fold unless you think you can steal with a small raise and opponent folds. But opponent's stack is similar, they may call. Risk of losing 8 chips for a weak hand is okay? 8 is 2.7% of stack. Could call and see flop cheap. But J8 off is low equity vs typical BB defending range. Better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

Position: BB, after SB and UTG (Seat1) called, it's our turn. We can check (play postflop) or raise. Considering our hand: 5T offsuit, not great, but can be played as a speculative hand if cheap. Raising might isolate and get heads-up. Opponent's tendency: from recall, they have raised sometimes preflop (12, 12, 12, 24, 232). But this time they just called. Might be playing tight? Not sure. In tournament early-ish with 36 BB, we want to preserve stack. 5T is not a hand to risk a big raise. Checking is fine, we can see flop cheap. If we raise, min raise is 16 (total). That would be raise to 16 total, meaning we put 8 more (since we already have 8). That's a 2BB raise. Might be okay to try to steal but opponent already called, so raise may not achieve steal, could be a 3-bet. Might be too aggressive.\n\nThus best action: check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise.

Our hand is weak; opponent likely has something better (maybe a jack, or a pair). Opponent's tendencies: from recall, they have raised preflop many times, also raised flop 24 chips (hand #9). That flop raise suggests they can be aggressive. But currently they checked flop. Could be they missed flop, or have a weak hand. Our hand is weak; we could try a small bluff to take pot. But risk: opponent may have Jacks or a set (maybe J J 4 gave them a pair of Jacks, they could have Jx). They might call or raise. With only 20 pot, raising to 8 is 40% pot. Could be okay as a bluff. However tournament considerations: we have 36.5 BB, not huge but decent. Preserving chips is important. A small bluff may be okay, but if opponent has a strong hand they could re-raise and we would be forced to fold and lose 8. That's okay. But maybe better to check and see river. River card unknown. Could be a straight or flush draw? Board: Jh Jc 4s 3s. No spade flush draw (two spades on board, we have no spade). So no flush draw. Straight draws: open-ended? 5-6-7-8-9? No. So not many draws.\n\nThus checking is safe. Considering opponent's previous pattern: they raised flop big when they had something. But they checked now, maybe they have medium hand like Jx or a pair of 4s, 3s. Could be they are checking to induce a bet. Our bet could be seen as a bluff; they may call with Jacks or a set, but they might also fold weaker. But we have no showdown value.\n\nGiven risk vs reward: pot 20, we can win 20 by betting 8 and being called maybe. If they fold, we win 20 for 8 risk. That's good EV if fold > 50% of time. Not sure.\n\nGiven limited info, I'd opt to check and see river. So action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have a river situation: board J h J c 4 s 3 s 2 s. So board is paired Jacks, and three spades 4s 3s 2s - a possible straight flush draw but missed. Our hand: 5h Td. So we have Ten of diamonds, Five of hearts. No pair, no straight, no flush. Board has two Jacks, so opponent could have a Jack, making a set, or a full house (Jacks full of something). Also could have a straight? Board: J J 4 3 2. Straight possible with A K Q? No. With 5? 5-4-3-2-A? No Ace. So only possible hands: any pair of Jacks (set), any two pair (Jacks plus something else), maybe a straight using 5-4-3-2-A? Not possible. Flush? Board has three spades, need two spades in hand, we have none. So opponent could have a flush if they have two spades, but board spades are 4s,3s,2s; need at least two spades for flush, but there are only three spades on board, need two more for flush, but opponent only has two cards, could be both spades, giving a flush (5 spades). That would be a flush higher than any pair. Could also have a full house: Jacks full of something (if they have a Jack plus another card that pairs board? Actually board has J J, no other pair. To have full house, they'd need a pair on board plus a Jack, but board has no pair besides Jacks. So full house could be Jacks full of something if they have a Jack and a card that pairs with board? No board pair besides Jacks. So full house could be Jacks over something if they have a Jack and the board pairs something else? Not possible. So full house could be something like 4-4? Board has a single 4, not a pair. So full house not possible unless opponent has a pair in hand and board has a pair (Jacks). They could have a pocket pair, e.g., 5-5, making full house (Jacks full of 5s) if board has J J and they have a pair, that's three of a kind Jacks on board plus pair in hand => full house Jacks over X. Actually board has two Jacks, you need a third Jack to make three of a kind, then pair from hand gives full house. But opponent could have a Jack and a card matching board? If they have Jx, they'd have trips Jacks (three of a kind) not full house. Full house requires three of a kind + a pair. So they could have a pocket pair of something else, e.g., 4-4, making full house (4s over Jacks) but board only has one 4. So they'd need two 4s in hand plus two Jacks on board = full house 4s over Jacks? Actually board: J J 4 3 2. If opponent has 4-4, they'd have three 4s (two in hand + one on board) and a pair of Jacks on board -> full house 4s over Jacks. That's possible. Similarly 3-3 gives full house 3s over Jacks, etc. So many full house possibilities.\n\nOur hand is worthless. We have no showdown value. So we should fold. The amount to call is 0, but we can check. The legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since we have no chance to win, we should check (or fold). Checking is fine, we don't lose more chips. So action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Q7 suited can make flush and straight draws, but also may be dominated. Consider tournament: 36 BB is decent, we can afford to see cheap flops. However, there is a big stack behind, may raise later.

So we are first to act after BB's raise. Our hand is weak. In tournament with 37.5 BB, we can fold. But also could consider calling to see flop with speculative hand in position (we will be out of position after flop because BB is in the big blind, but we will be first to act preflop after them, then flop we will be first to act (since we are button and they are BB). Actually button acts last preflop, but after BB raise we are first to act? No, order: SB, BB, then button, then UTG etc. Since we are button, we act after BB. So we will act now. If we call, we will be in the pot with 8 extra (total 16). Our stack after call will be 284. The raise size is 16 total, which is 2 BB (since BB is 8). So it's a 2x raise. That's a small raise. With 4-5 offsuit, maybe a call is okay to see flop, but it's a low suited connector? Actually 4d5c unsuited, low connector, can make straights, but not great.\n\nConsider opponent's tendencies: MiniMax-M2's recent actions: they called preflop with 8 in hand #50, then called flop big bet 48 (so they were willing to call large flop bet). In hand 47 they called turn 12 after earlier action. They also folded preflop often. They seem to call with unknown range. Not extremely tight. Could be calling light. So raising to 16 is a small raise, maybe they are trying to steal? Or they could be defending.\n\nGiven we have 37.5 BB, we can afford to fold and preserve stack. 4-5 is not strong enough to call a raise from BB in early tournament? However, button is best position. But we will be out of position post-flop. Still can see flop cheap.\n\nPot odds: current pot 28 (including blinds and our call?). Actually pot before action: SB 4, BB 8, we called 8, SB folded, BB raised to 16, pot currently is 4 (SB) + 8 (BB) + 8 (our call) = 20? Wait: after SB posted 4, BB posted 8, we called 8, SB folded, BB raised to 16 (adds 8 more). So pot now is 4 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 28? Actually the raise adds 8, making BB's total contribution 16. So total pot = SB 4 + BB 16 + our call 8 = 28. Yes.\n\nWe need to call 8 to continue, making pot 36. So pot odds = 8/(8+28) = 8/36 = 22.2% needed to break even. Our hand equity vs unknown range? 4-5 offsuit vs typical BB raising range maybe 15%? Our equity maybe around 12-15% maybe less. So not profitable.\n\nThus folding is likely correct.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\n",

So we have a gutshot straight draw plus flush draw. Also we have a pair? No. So decent draw.\n\nPot is 24 chips. Stack 284. Opponent MiniMax-M2 has 225 chips. Preflop actions: seat4 called 8 (so in the pot). So flop action: after preflop, seat5 (us) is SB, seat1 (Kimi) is BB? Actually seat1 is BB, seat5 is SB.

Wait seat4 is MiniMax-M2, seat5 is us, seat1 is BB. The flop order: The player left of the dealer (SB) acts first? In Texas Hold'em, flop action starts with the first active player left of the dealer button. The button is seat5? Actually we are SB seat5, button is seat? Not given. But preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, seat4 called 8 (so they are under the gun? Actually seat4 is MP maybe). Then seat5 call 4 (SB). Then seat1 (BB) check. So after preflop, seat4 (MiniMax) is the only other player besides us and BB. The BB checked, so flop action: first to act is seat4 (MiniMax) because they are left of button? Actually after preflop, the first to act on flop is the player left of the button (i.e., SB). But the SB (us) is seat5, but we are after seat4? Hmm typical: Button is seat5? No, SB is seat5, BB is seat1, seat4 is UTG? The button is seat? Not given. In a 5-player game, button rotates; currently seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB, so button is seat4? Possibly. So flop action order: first to act is seat5 (SB) because it's left of button? Actually the button is seat4, so first to act is seat5 (SB). So we have the option to act now. The legal actions: fold, check, raise. So opponent hasn't acted yet on flop. So we can check or raise.\n\nOur hand: strong draw, pot 24, opponent stack 225, we have 284. We could bet to build pot and possibly take down now, but also risk being raised. Considering opponent tendencies: recall shows MiniMax-M2 has flopped bets of 4,4,6,4,20,8. So they sometimes bet small, sometimes big (20). They may be aggressive. In this hand, they haven't acted yet; we can check and see what they do. With a draw, checking can induce a bet from them, giving us odds. However, we have position? Actually we are first to act, so checking gives them opportunity to bet. If they bet, we can call (or raise). Since we have a decent draw, calling a moderate bet is okay.\n\nPot 24, we have 284, we can afford a raise. Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total? Actually raise_to is total amount, minimum raise is 8 which would be raise to 8? Since amount to call is 0, raising to 8 would be a bet of 8). That's a small bet relative to pot (8 into 24). Might be okay to put pressure. If they have a hand they might call or raise. Could also raise bigger to protect.\n\nGiven opponent's range includes draws and made hands. A bet of 8 could be good to get value from top pair or to charge draws. But we also risk being raised by a stronger hand, but we can fold then.\n\nI think best is to bet (raise) to 8 (i.e., bet 8). Reason: we have strong draws, want to build pot, and we can get value if they have a pair. Also we can protect against free cards.\n\nThus action: raise to 8.\n\n"

Turn: we have amount to call 0 (so it's our action). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 8. So we can check or raise. Our stack 276 chips, we have 34.5 BB, pot 48 chips. Our hand Qh7h has a flush draw (2 hearts on board, we have two hearts, need one more). There are two hearts left in deck? Actually hearts remaining: we have Qh,7h, board has 9h,6h. So hearts left: Ah, Kh, Jh, Th, 8h,5h,4h,2h = 8 hearts. Turn card unknown (already dealt? Actually board shows turn? Board is 9h 3s 6h 3d - that's four cards, so turn is 3d. So turn just happened, we are acting after turn. So we have seen the turn card: 3d (a diamond). That does not affect flush. So we have 2 hearts on board, we have two hearts, still need one more heart on river. There are 8 hearts left out of remaining unseen cards: deck size initially 52, known cards: our 2, opponent 0 known, board 4 = 6 known, plus blinds? irrelevant. So 46 unknown cards, 8 hearts => probability ~ 8/46 = 17.4% to hit flush on river. Also we have backdoor straight possibilities? Not relevant.\n\nWe have pot 48, we could bet to protect against draws? Opponents: Kimi-K2 (Seat1) stack 445, unknown style. MiniMax-M2 stack 217, we have recall: they have raised preflop sometimes and flop raises sometimes, sometimes big raise (40) on flop. So they can be aggressive. On turn we have a drawing hand, want to either semi-bluff or check. Since we have only 48 pot, raising to maybe 48 or 56? Minimum raise 8, but we could raise larger to apply pressure. Our stack 276, not short. Considering tournament stage, we have 34 BB, decent. Opponents have bigger stacks (445 and 217). They could call or raise. A raise may fold out weaker hands like middle pair, but they may have made a hand (maybe 9x, 3x). They have called flop bet 8, so they might have some pair or draw. Could be 9x, 6x, 3x, flush draw, etc.\n\nOur hand is not strong now, only a draw. A check might give free river, but we may lose if opponent bets and we have to call. A raise could be a semi-bluff: we could raise to about 80 (pot+?) to apply pressure. But we need to consider implied odds: If we hit flush, we could win big. Opponents' stacks: 217 and 445, pot 48. If we raise to 80, they'd need to call 80 to win 128 pot (plus future river bet). Might be okay.\n\nBut also we could consider check-raise later? Not possible now.\n\nGiven we have a draw, I think a raise is appropriate to protect against opponent's pair and also build pot for when we hit flush. So raise to maybe 80 (approx 1.5x pot). Minimum raise is 8, but we can raise more. Since legal actions include raise, we must specify raise_to total amount. Let's choose raise_to 80.\n\nReasoning: semi-bluff, decent equity, protect against draws, opponent likely to fold weaker hands.\n\nThus output."

So we are to act facing 8 to call (BB). Legal actions: fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to 16 (so raise total to 16). Need to decide.\n\nConsider hand strength: A3 offsuit is weak. In BTN, but still not great. Could be used for stealing blinds, but opponent in BB is MiniMax-M2 with 209 chips (about 26 BB). He may defend. Need to consider opponent tendencies: recall shows he raised preflop three times: amounts 4,8,16 (these are raises from earlier hands). Not sure context. Might indicate he's aggressive raising from BB? Actually those are his actions when he was in some seat (maybe early position). Not enough.\n\nWe can also recall opponent's fold to raises? But limited.\n\nGiven stack sizes, we have 39 BB, can afford a raise. But A3o is not a good raise for value; maybe a steal attempt is okay, but BB may defend with wide range. Since we have decent stack, but not huge, maybe we should just call and see flop? But calling with A3o out of position (BTN vs BB) after SB? Actually we are BTN, after SB and BB posted, we act first preflop. If we call, we will be out of position postflop vs BB (since BB is last to act preflop, then flop action starts with SB, then BB, then us). So we would be out of position. That's disadvantage.\n\nBetter to raise to try to steal, but risk being 3-bet? Actually only one raise possible preflop (we can raise). If we raise to 16 (total), that's 8 more chips beyond call. That is a 2x raise (standard). If BB folds, we win 12 pot + 4 SB = 12? Actually pot is 12 (SB+BB+our call). If we raise, pot will be bigger.\n\nGiven opponent's range, maybe they defend with many hands. A3o is not strong enough to continue if they call. So raising is risky. Could fold.\n\nWhat about calling? If we call, we will be out of position, but we have Ace high which may win if flop has Ace. But also could be dominated by better Ace.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, we have decent stack, but we want to preserve chips. A3o is not worth risking. I think fold is appropriate.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

Actually seat1 posted SB 8, seat4 posted BB 16. So we are facing a 16 call to see flop. Minimum raise is 32 (i.e., raise to 32 total). We have Qc Kh (broadway suited? Actually Qc and Kh are not same suit, unsuited). Hand strength: decent, about 12% preflop, good for button. Need to consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (SB) has raised preflop 4 times small raise of 12 (likely 3bb?), and one large raise 105 (maybe all-in). So SB seems aggressive, but small raise maybe a steal attempt. MiniMax-M2 (BB) hasn't acted yet preflop (just posted BB). We have no data for BB. But typical play: we can raise to isolate SB or BB. With QK offsuit on button, a standard raise to 3x BB (48) is typical. But stack is 18.5 BB, so raising to 32 is 2x BB (minimum). Could raise to 48 (3x) but need to ensure legal: minimum raise is 32, but we can raise higher up to our stack. Should we raise? Considering we have decent hand, we want to take initiative, isolate. Opponent SB appears to raise small often, but we are not facing a raise, just a call. Actually there is no raise yet, we can either call (i.e., just limp) or raise. LIMP with QK is not ideal. So raise. How much? Maybe to 48 (3x) to build pot and discourage multiple callers. But also consider stack size: 296 chips, raising to 48 leaves 248 behind, still decent. Opponents' stacks: SB 477, BB 189. Raising to 48 may be okay.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: we have 18.5 BB, relatively short stack but not ultra short. Raising is good.\n\nThus action: raise to 48 (or maybe 40). Minimum raise is 32, but raising to 48 is okay. Choose raise_to 48.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Wait preflop pot: SB 8 (folded), BB 16, we raised to 48 (so we added 32 more?), Actually raise to 48 means we put 48 total, which is 32 more than BB's 16. Then BB called 32 to match 48, so pot = 8+16+48+48 = 120? But given pot 104, maybe SB posted 8 and folded, BB 16, we raised to 48 (so we added 32), BB called 32, total contributions: SB 8, BB 16+32=48, us 48, total 104. Yes that matches: SB 8 (but folded, still in pot). So pot 104.\n\nNow flop: BB checked. We have 248 stack, pot 104, we are out of position (but we are BTN, after flop we act first? Actually action order: preflop we raised, BB called, flop we act first (since he checked). So we are first to act.\n\nWe have Qc Kh. Options: check, bet (raise). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. No bet action, only raise (since it's a bet/raise). Minimum raise to 32, meaning we can raise to 32 total? Actually raise to 32 means total bet of 32? Since amount to call is 0, raise to 32 would be a bet of 32. So we can bet 32 minimum. Pot is 104, bet 32 is about 0.3 pot. Could also raise larger.\n\nConsider opponent's tendencies: He checks flop often (history shows many checks). Could be passive. He may have weak hand or drawing. Our overcards are decent. With 15.5 BB stack, we can afford to bet. Goal: steal pot or see turn cheap. Since we have two overcards, we could bet to protect against draws and extract value from weaker hands like Jx, 5x, 4x, maybe a pocket pair like TT? Actually board J 5 4, opponent could have J, 5, 4, or draws like 9-8 (open-ended? 9-8 would give straight draw with J?). Actually 9-8 gives open-ended straight draw (needs 7 or T). Could be. So betting may fold out draws.\n\nGiven our stack size moderate, we can bet about half pot to protect and get value. So raise to maybe 80 (around 0.75 pot). But minimum raise is 32. We can raise to 80 if allowed (must be at least 32). We need to consider risk: if opponent has Jx, they may call or raise. If they have a set (JJ), they'd raise. But they checked, likely not a set. Could be a weak J, but they'd call. So betting is fine.\n\nThus decide to raise to 80 (or 100). Stack "

Actually J T would give A K Q J T = Broadway straight, but board missing J and T, so they would need both J and T in hand to make straight, improbable.

Actually board is 8c 6s 7d, that's a 6-7-8 run, we have 5-5, we have a gutshot straight draw (needs 4 for 4-5-6-7-8) and also a set? No, we have pair of fives, not on board. So we have middle pair, but board is connected, possible straight possibilities for opponents: they could have 9-5? Actually 9-5 would give straight 5-6-7-8-9, but we have 5s 5c, not 9. They could have 9-9 (set of 9s) not possible because board has no 9. Opponents could have 8-9 (open-ended), 5-9 (makes straight). Also they could have 4-5 (makes straight). So we are vulnerable.\n\nWe are in BB, called a raise of 32 (so pot after preflop: blinds 8+16 =24, raise 32 (so total 32 from mini?), Actually preflop: Seat4 raise 32 (so 32 total, meaning they raised to 32, so they added 16 more? Actually blind is 16, raise to 32 means they put 32 total, so they added 16 more). Then seat5 call 24 (so we called 24 more? Wait we posted SB 8? Actually seat5 is BB, posted BB 16, then seat4 raise 32, seat5 call 24 (so we put 24 more to match 32 total). So pot now: 8 (SB) +16 (BB) +32 (raise) +24 (call) =80, matches pot.\n\nNow flop 8c 6s 7d. We have 5-5. So we have a pair, plus a gutshot to straight (needs 4). Also we have a backdoor flush draw? Suits: we have 5s, 5c, board has 8c, 6s, 7d. We have one spade (5s) and one club (5c). Two spades on board? Only 6s. So we have 2 spades?

The actions list only preflop. So now it's our turn to act first? Usually action is from left of button, but BB is after UTG? Actually flop action starts with first active player left of button (SB). SB is folded? Seat1 folded preflop. So first active is seat4 (MiniMax). So it's MiniMax's turn first. But we have no actions yet listed for flop. Actually we need to act after MiniMax. So currently amount to call is 0 because no bet yet. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need to decide: Should we check and see? Pocket fives are weak on this board, but we have a gutshot and pair. Opponent may have 8,6,7 combos, or straight draws. He raised preflop, likely has strong range: maybe high cards, broadways, maybe 9T, etc. On flop 8-6-7, his range includes: 8x, 6x, 7x, 9-8, 9-7, 9-6, 5-9 (straight), 4-5 (straight), etc. He may have a made hand like 8-8 (set), 6-6 (set), 7-7 (set), or two pair like 8-7, 8-6, 7-6, or a straight like 9-5, 4-5.

No, board doesn't have a 5, so we have a pair of fives, which is currently second pair (pair of 5s vs board Q,8,7,6). Actually board has no pair, so we have a pair of 5s, which is low. Opponent is MiniMax-M2 with 141 chips, likely the only remaining opponent (others folded). Preflop: MiniMax raised to 32, we called. Flop: board 8c 6s 7d, we checked, they checked. Turn: board Qd appears. Pot now 80 chips. It's our turn (BB). Opponent's stack 141, we have 304. So we are big stack relative. Opponent's actions: preflop raise 32, we called, flop check-check. So opponent may be passive or checking with a marginal hand. Turn Qd is a scary card: they could have Qx, they could have straight draws (9-10?). Actually board now 8-6-7-Q, they could have a straight: 5-9? No. Straight combos: 5-9? Need 5-9 to make 5-6-7-8-9? No board 6-7-8, need 5 and 9 to make 5-6-7-8-9, but we have 5s5c; they could have 9-5 but we have both fives, so they can't have 5. So possible straight: 9-10? 9-10 would make 6-7-8-9-10? No need 6-7-8-9-10, board has 8,6,7, need 9-10 for open-ended straight? Actually board 6-7-8, with turn Q, you need 9-10 to have open-ended? Not relevant. They could have a pair of Queens, two pair, etc. Could have a set of 8? No 8 on board, they could have 8x for trips. They could have 6x for trips, etc.\n\nOur hand is weak: pair of fives, gutshot to a straight (needs 4). Also could make a set on river if a 5 hits, but low chance.\n\nWe need to decide action. Options: check (0 call) or raise (minimum raise 16). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. There's no bet to call, so we can check or raise.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, likely best to check. But consider opponent's tendencies: they checked flop, maybe they have a weak hand, could be checking to see river. If we bet, we could try to steal the pot. Pot is 80, we have 304 chips. If we bet 16 (minimum raise) we could take pot. But opponent could call with many hands. Since we have low equity, maybe better to check and see river.\n\nWe could also consider a small raise to try to take down pot. But opponent might call with many draws. Our hand is not strong; raising could risk chips. Check seems safe.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nWe need to output JSON.\n\n",

Wait we have 5s5c, board has pair of 6s, plus 8,7,Q. So our best 5-card hand: 6-6-5-5-Q? Actually we can use both fives and both sixes: that is two pair, sixes and fives, with queen kicker. That's two pair, not a full house. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) unknown cards. Board also has straight possibilities: 8-6-7-? Actually 6-7-8 is three consecutive; need 5 or 9 for straight. Our pocket 5s gives us a straight 5-6-7-8? Yes, board 6-7-8, we have 5, so we have a 5-6-7-8 straight, need a 4 or 9? Actually a straight needs five cards; we have 5,6,7,8,? need 9 or 4. Not there. So we don't have straight. But we have a gutshot? Not.\n\nWe have two pair, which is moderate. Opponent's likely range: preflop they raised to 32 from UTG? Actually seat 4 raise 32 (presumably from CO? Not sure). They raised from seat 4 (maybe CO). They called our call. So they opened raise. Their range could be strong: broadways, pairs, suited connectors. Board now: Qd,8c,6s,7d,6c. They could have Qx, 8x, 7x, 6x, 9T, JT, etc. They could have a set of 6s if they have 6?

Actually board has one Q, so with Qx they'd have two Qs plus pair of 6s = two pair (Q and 6). Not full house. To have full house, they'd need a hand that pairs board and also pairs another board rank: e.g., 8-8 gives full house 8s over 6s, or 7-7 gives full house 7s over 6s, or Q-Q gives full house Qs over 6s, or 6-x gives trips but not full house unless they have a pair?

Actually actions: flop: both checked, turn: both checked, so now river we act first? Actually it's still our turn? Usually after turn check, river we act first, opponent then acts. So we can bet (raise) as a bluff. Opponent's stack? Opponent seat 4 has 141 chips. Pot is 80. If we bet 16 (minimum raise) that's 16 into 80, pot becomes 96, they may call with weak hands.

Actually actions: seat1 posted sb 8, seat4 posted bb 16. No other raises yet. So we are to act facing a 16 (big blind) amount to call? Actually amount to call is 16 (the big blind). So we can call 16 to see flop, raise minimum to 32 (i.e., raise total to 32). Our hand is K9 offsuit, not a premium hand but decent in position. Consider stack depth: 24 BB, tournament early? Not given but we have decent stack. Opponent MiniMax-M2 is BB with 125 chips (7.8 BB). So they are short-stacked relative to us. They posted BB 16, leaving 109 effective stack. Our raise would be 32 total (i.e., 16 more). That would be 2 BB raise. That might put pressure on short stack. But K9 offsuit is marginal for a raise in early tournament? In BTN vs BB, you can raise to steal blinds. Since BB is short, they may call or shove. However, they have 125 chips, about 7.8 BB. In many tournaments, a short stack may be inclined to shove all-in when facing a raise. So raising might get us all-in for 32 (our raise) vs their 125. Actually if we raise to 32, they'd have to call 16 more (i.e., put 32 total). That's a relatively small risk. Could also just call 16 and see flop. But K9 offsuit is not a strong hand to call and see flop out of position (but we are BTN). However we have position post-flop, which is valuable. With 24 BB, we can afford a raise to try to pick up blinds. Also opponent's raise pattern: from recall, they raised 4,8,16,32 in previous hands (preflop). Those are small raises relative to blinds? Not sure. Those were raise amounts (maybe total raise amounts). They have been raising small amounts. So they may be aggressive or just raise to see flop. Might be okay to raise.\n\nGiven we have King high, potential to hit top pair, decent equity. I'd raise to 32 to apply pressure and possibly win blinds. Reason: position, decent hand, short stack opponent likely to call all-in or fold, and we can win chips.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 32.\n\n",

So we have no made hand, just 9-high. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 16 into pot 48, so pot after bet will be 48+16=64? Actually pot before bet 48, opponent bets 16, now amount to call 16, pot effective 64 (including opponent's bet). Our stack 392. Need to evaluate opponent's range. They are short stack 93 chips, likely looking to steal or push with strong hand. Board is very favorable for many hands: any Ten, any set, any full house, any quads. Opponent could have a Ten (makes quads), a K (makes full house KTTT), a 9 (makes full house 9TTT? Actually 9 with board TTTK gives full house 9s over Tens? Wait full house requires three of a kind plus a pair. Board already has three tens, so any other pair gives full house: e.g., 9 9 gives 9s over tens? Actually board TTTK plus 9 9 gives two nines, board has three tens, so you have full house: tens full of nines? Actually you have 9 9 plus board T T T K. You have a pair of nines, board has three tens, so you have full house: tens full of nines (TTT99). So any pocket pair (except tens) gives full house. Also any Ten gives quads. Also any K gives full house KTTT? Actually K with board gives K K T T T? You have K + board K? Actually board Kd, you have K? If you have Kx, you have pair of Ks plus triple tens = full house K over tens. So many strong combos.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely we should fold. But consider possibility of bluff? Opponent short stack might be trying to steal pot with missed draw, but board is scary. We have 9c7s no flush draw, no straight draw, no pair. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Player in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 16 (i.e., matched big blind). So pot is 40 (8+16+16). Amount to call is 8 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise to 32 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe consider hand strength: A3 offsuit is weak, especially in SB facing a BB and a caller. It's a marginal hand, not a good raise. Could call to see flop cheap? In SB with 24 BB stack, calling 8 is 0.5 BB, which is okay to see flop. However, the opponent (MiniMax-M2) seems to call often preflop, maybe passive. Not much info on Kimi-K2 (seat1) as they are BB and haven't acted yet (they are BB). Actually seat1 is BB, they posted 16 already. So after we act, then BB will act (Kimi-K2). We need to consider that BB could raise. If we call, we will be out of position postflop, but we have A3, not great. Might consider folding to preserve stack. However, 8 is cheap. In tournament, with 24 BB, you can afford to call a few cheap hands. A3 suited? It's offsuit, not great. But could be used to steal? No, we're SB, not raising.\n\nGiven the opponent's behavior: MiniMax-M2 often just calls, rarely raises. So likely they have a wide range. The BB (Kimi-K2) unknown. Could be tight or loose. If we call and BB raises, we are forced to fold likely. So calling is low risk.\n\nThus best action: call 8.

          "reasoning_content": "We have a flop: 2h 3d 9s. Our hand: A\u2666 3\u2663 (Ad 3c). So we have top pair (3s) with top kicker Ace. Also a backdoor straight draw? Not really. Board: 2-3-9, we have pair of threes. Opponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) is the only other player besides us and Kimi (BB) but Kimi checked preflop and is still in? Actually seat 1 is BB, they checked preflop. So both are in. The pot is 48 chips. No bet on flop yet; it's our turn (SB) after seat 4 called preflop and seat 1 checked. Actually order: SB posted 8, BB posted 16, seat 4 called 16, seat 5 (SB) called 8 (so we are in). Then seat 1 (BB) checked. So flop action order: seat 4 (MiniMax) acts first, then seat 5 (us), then seat 1 (BB). But we have the flop board, and actions listed: amount to call 0, legal actions fold, check, raise. So presumably MiniMax checked? Wait we didn't see MiniMax's flop action. The \"Actions this hand\" only includes preflop actions. So on flop we need to decide. But we have no info of MiniMax's action yet; likely it's our turn first? Actually SB is seat 5, BB is seat 1, seat 4 is MP? The order on flop: seat 4 (MP) first, then seat 5 (SB), then seat 1 (BB). Since no actions listed, we are at seat 5's turn? Actually seat 4 may have acted already; maybe they bet? But we don't know. The prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning no bet currently. So we can check or raise. Need to decide based on hand strength and opponent tendencies.\n\nWe have a decent hand: top pair A kicker. MiniMax's flop betting pattern: historically they bet small amounts (4,4,6,4,8) and one larger (20). So they are capable of betting small to protect. Could be they would bet here. Since no bet, maybe they checked. So we can either check or raise. Considering stack: we have 376 chips, pot 48. Raising could build pot, but also risk if opponent has a better hand (e.g., 9x, 2x, straight draws). Board is relatively dry. Our hand is strong but not nuts; 9x could be overpair; also 2-3 combos could have two pair, but we have top pair with Ace kicker. Could be we want to protect against draws (like 45 for straight draw). Actually 45 gives open-ended straight draw (4-5). That's possible. Opponent could have 45, but they'd likely bet. Since they didn't, maybe they have weak hand.\n\nThus we could check to see if BB (Kimi) will bet. But Kimi is short stack? Kimi has 437 chips, bigger than us. Could be they will bet. Checking might allow them to bet, and we could call or raise later.\n\nGiven we have top pair, I think we should raise to protect and extract value. Minimum raise is 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). That is small, but we could raise bigger, maybe to 48 (pot). However we have to consider opponent's stack: MiniMax has 125 chips. Raising to 48 would be okay. But we need to decide based on legal raise amount? Minimum raise to 16, but we can raise any amount up to our stack. Usually we raise to about 2.5x pot. So maybe raise to 80 chips.\n\nBut we need to consider that if we raise too much, they may fold better hands (like 9x). But we want value from weaker hands (like 3x with weak kicker). So moderate raise.\n\nThus I will raise to 80 chips. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

So board pairs twos, we have Ad 3c, giving us a pair of threes (with kicker Ace) and also a backdoor straight? Actually board: 2,2,3,9. Our hand: A3 gives us trips? Wait we have 3c, board has 3d, so we have a pair of threes (two threes). Not trips. Board also has pair of twos, so there is a full house possible on board: 2s 2h 3d 9s? Actually board has two twos and a three, so board is a pair of twos with a three. Our hand gives us a pair of threes, making two pair (threes and twos). So we have two pair, tens? Actually our kicker is Ace.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) seat 4 has 45 chips left (short stack). He called flop bet of 80 (pot after flop was 208? Actually preflop pot: after preflop, seat4 called 16, seat5 called 8, seat1 checked, so pot = 16+8+16? Wait blinds: seat5 posted sb 8, seat1 posted bb 16, seat4 called 16 (big blind), seat5 call 8 (to match big blind). So pot after preflop = 8+16+16+8 = 48? Actually sb 8 + bb 16 + call 16 + call 8 = 48. Then seat1 checked, seat5 bet 80 on flop, seat1 folded, seat4 called 80. So pot after flop: previous 48 + 80*2 = 208. Yes matches pot.\n\nNow turn: board adds 2s, making board: 2h 3d 9s 2s. So board now has trips of twos? Actually two twos, not three. So board has pair of twos. Player has A3, so two pair (2s and 3s). Opponent's range unknown but short stack 45 chips, pot 208, effective stack for opponent is 45 (he's short). He has already invested 80+16+? Actually his total investment so far: 16 preflop + 80 flop = 96. He has 45 left, so his total stack is 141? Wait his total stack originally maybe larger but now only 45 left. So he's effectively all-in for 45 if he bets.\n\nOur stack 296, we have 208 in pot, opponent 45 left. So we can consider betting or checking. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 80 (so raise must be at least 80 total). But opponent only has 45, so if we raise to 80, he'll be all-in for 45 (we can call his all-in). But raise to 80 is a raise of 80 total, meaning we add 80 to pot? Actually we have amount to call 0 (since opponent hasn't acted yet). Minimum raise to 80 means we need to put at least 80 chips into pot, raising to 80 total (since amount to call is 0). That is a raise of 80. That would be a bet of 80. Opponent can call all-in for 45 (but would be less than bet). Usually you can bet 80, opponent can go all-in for less, you can call his all-in, but you would be overbetting the pot. However, is that allowed? In many tournaments you can bet up to your stack; opponent can call all-in less than your bet; you would win extra chips but it's okay.\n\nWe need to decide best action. Evaluate hand strength: we have two pair (A kicker). Opponent could have a better hand: maybe a full house (2s over something), or a set of 2s? Actually board has two twos; opponent could have a 2 (making trips), or a 9 (making pair of nines with board pair twos? Actually board has 9s only one nine; opponent could have 9X to make trips? No, only one nine on board, so need another nine to make trips; possible. Opponent could have a straight? Board: 2,3,9,2. Straight possibilities: 4-5-6-7? Not possible.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: Board after turn: 2h 3d 9s 2s. So board pairs twos, we have Ad 3c, giving us a pair of threes (with kicker Ace) and also a backdoor straight? Actually board: 2,2,3,9. Our hand: A3 gives us trips? Wait we have 3c, board has 3d, so we have a pair of threes (two threes). Not trips. Board also has pair of twos, so there is a full house possible on board: 2s 2h 3d 9s? Actually board has two twos and a three, so board is a pair of twos with a three. Our hand gives us a pair of threes, making two pair (threes and twos). So we have two pair, tens? Actually our kicker is Ace.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) seat 4 has 45 chips left (short stack). He called flop bet of 80 (pot after flop was 208? Actually preflop pot: after preflop, seat4 called 16, seat5 called 8, seat1 checked, so pot = 16+8+16? Wait blinds: seat5 posted sb 8, seat1 posted bb 16, seat4 called 16 (big blind), seat5 call 8 (to match big blind). So pot after preflop = 8+16+16+8 = 48? Actually sb 8 + bb 16 + call 16 + call 8 = 48. Then seat1 checked, seat5 bet 80 on flop, seat1 folded, seat4 called 80. So pot after flop: previous 48 + 80*2 = 208. Yes matches pot.\n\nNow turn: board adds 2s, making board: 2h 3d 9s 2s. So board now has trips of twos? Actually two twos, not three. So board has pair of twos. Player has A3, so two pair (2s and 3s). Opponent's range unknown but short stack 45 chips, pot 208, effective stack for opponent is 45 (he's short). He has already invested 80+16+? Actually his total investment so far: 16 preflop + 80 flop = 96. He has 45 left, so his total stack is 141? Wait his total stack originally maybe larger but now only 45 left. So he's effectively all-in for 45 if he bets.\n\nOur stack 296, we have 208 in pot, opponent 45 left. So we can consider betting or checking. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 80 (so raise must be at least 80 total). But opponent only has 45, so if we raise to 80, he'll be all-in for 45 (we can call his all-in). But raise to 80 is a raise of 80 total, meaning we add 80 to pot? Actually we have amount to call 0 (since opponent hasn't acted yet). Minimum raise to 80 means we need to put at least 80 chips into pot, raising to 80 total (since amount to call is 0). That is a raise of 80. That would be a bet of 80. Opponent can call all-in for 45 (but would be less than bet). Usually you can bet 80, opponent can go all-in for less, you can call his all-in, but you would be overbetting the pot. However, is that allowed? In many tournaments you can bet up to your stack; opponent can call all-in less than your bet; you would win extra chips but it's okay.\n\nWe need to decide best action. Evaluate hand strength: we have two pair (A kicker). Opponent could have a better hand: maybe a full house (2s over something), or a set of 2s? Actually board has two twos; opponent could have a 2 (making trips), or a 9 (making pair of nines with board pair twos? Actually board has 9s only one nine; opponent could have 9X to make trips? No, only one nine on board, so need another nine to make trips; possible. Opponent could have a straight? Board: 2,3,9,2. Straight possibilities: 4-5-6-7? Not possible. So only possible strong hands: set of 2s (if opponent holds a 2), set of 3s (if opponent holds a 3, but board has only one 3, so they'd have a set of threes), full house (if opponent has a 2 and a 3? Actually board has pair of twos and",

          "content": "We have hand #70 preflop. Position: BB (seat5). Cards: 9d Js. Stack 272 chips (17 BB). Blinds 8/16. Pot 24. Action: SB posted 8 (seat5 is BB? Actually seat5 is BB). Wait seat5 is us, BB posted 16? Actually actions: Seat5 post_sb 8 (so seat5 also posted small blind? That seems odd: seat5 is BB but posted SB? Might be they are in BB seat but also SB? Possibly seat5 is BB and also posted SB because seat5 is BB? Actually typical: seat5 is BB, seat4 is SB. But actions show seat5 post_sb 8, seat1 post_bb 16, seat4 fold. So seat5 is SB? But description says Position: BB (Seat5). So maybe they swapped: seat5 is BB but posted SB? Might be a mistake. Anyway amount to call is 8 (the SB). Minimum raise to 32. So we are facing a bet of 8 from the SB (our own blind?), Actually we are in BB, we posted 16, and the SB posted 8, then we need to call 8 to match SB? Actually after blinds, the action goes to UTG etc, but here only seat5 (SB) posted 8, seat1 (BB) posted 16, seat4 folded. So we are SB? But they said Position: BB (Seat5). The pot is 24 (8+16). Amount to call 8 means we need to call the BB's 16? Wait confusion.\n\nProbably we are in BB and we posted 16, and the SB (seat5?) posted 8? Actually seat5 is us, they posted SB 8, then seat1 posted BB 16, seat4 folded. So we are SB? But they say Position: BB (Seat5). So maybe the seat numbers are off. Regardless, we have to act facing a bet of 8 (the BB's 16? Actually we need to call 8). So we can call 8, raise to at least 32.\n\nOur hand 9d Js is a suited jack-nine off-suit? Actually Js is spade, 9d diamond. So unsuited. That's a marginal hand in early position (BB). Stack 17 BB. Need to decide.\n\nWe need opponent tendencies. Opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat1). We have recall of recent raises: they raised 24 preflop (3bb) in hands 54,56,59,60, and 48 in hand69 (3bb? Actually 48 is 3bb? With blinds 8/16, 3bb is 48? Yes 16*3=48). So they tend to raise 3bb preflop.\n\nNow they are the BB? Actually seat1 is BB with 16 posted. They raised? Wait we are acting after seat1 posted BB 16, and seat4 folded. So it's our turn to act (BB? Actually we are SB?). The amount to call is 8 (the SB). So we can call the BB's 16? Actually we need to call 8 to match the BB? In typical scenario: SB posts 8, BB posts 16, then action goes to UTG. If everyone folds, then SB can check, BB can check. But here it's preflop and only SB and BB are left, and it's SB's turn? Actually after posting blinds, action goes to first player left of BB (UTG). If everyone folds, then SB gets first action. Since seat4 folded, seat5 (SB) would act first, but they already posted SB. So they can check or raise. Amount to call is 8 (the BB's 16? No, to call the BB's 16 you need to put 8 more). So we need to call 8 to match BB's 16. So we can call 8, raise to 32 (total), or fold.\n\nOur hand 9-J off-suit is not strong enough to raise here, especially against a player who may be willing to defend with a wide range. But we are short stack 17BB, still enough to play.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to raise preflop when they are in BB? Actually they have been raising when they are in BB? Not sure. But they have been raising 3bb when they are BB? Could be they raise from BB as a continuation after being first to act? Actually they are BB, they posted 16, then they might raise preflop (like a raise after SB). But here they just posted BB, no raise.\n\nWe can call 8 and see flop. 9-J suited? Actually unsuited. Might be okay to limp? But we have 17BB, we can limp and see flop"

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #70 preflop. Position: BB (seat5). Cards: 9d Js. Stack 272 chips (17 BB). Blinds 8/16. Pot 24. Action: SB posted 8 (seat5 is BB? Actually seat5 is BB). Wait seat5 is us, BB posted 16? Actually actions: Seat5 post_sb 8 (so seat5 also posted small blind? That seems odd: seat5 is BB but posted SB? Might be they are in BB seat but also SB? Possibly seat5 is BB and also posted SB because seat5 is BB? Actually typical: seat5 is BB, seat4 is SB. But actions show seat5 post_sb 8, seat1 post_bb 16, seat4 fold. So seat5 is SB? But description says Position: BB (Seat5). So maybe they swapped: seat5 is BB but posted SB? Might be a mistake. Anyway amount to call is 8 (the SB). Minimum raise to 32. So we are facing a bet of 8 from the SB (our own blind?), Actually we are in BB, we posted 16, and the SB posted 8, then we need to call 8 to match SB? Actually after blinds, the action goes to UTG etc, but here only seat5 (SB) posted 8, seat1 (BB) posted 16, seat4 folded. So we are SB? But they said Position: BB (Seat5). The pot is 24 (8+16). Amount to call 8 means we need to call the BB's 16? Wait confusion.\n\nProbably we are in BB and we posted 16, and the SB (seat5?) posted 8? Actually seat5 is us, they posted SB 8, then seat1 posted BB 16, seat4 folded. So we are SB? But they say Position: BB (Seat5). So maybe the seat numbers are off. Regardless, we have to act facing a bet of 8 (the BB's 16? Actually we need to call 8). So we can call 8, raise to at least 32.\n\nOur hand 9d Js is a suited jack-nine off-suit? Actually Js is spade, 9d diamond. So unsuited. That's a marginal hand in early position (BB). Stack 17 BB. Need to decide.\n\nWe need opponent tendencies. Opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat1). We have recall of recent raises: they raised 24 preflop (3bb) in hands 54,56,59,60, and 48 in hand69 (3bb? Actually 48 is 3bb? With blinds 8/16, 3bb is 48? Yes 16*3=48). So they tend to raise 3bb preflop.\n\nNow they are the BB? Actually seat1 is BB with 16 posted. They raised? Wait we are acting after seat1 posted BB 16, and seat4 folded. So it's our turn to act (BB? Actually we are SB?). The amount to call is 8 (the SB). So we can call the BB's 16? Actually we need to call 8 to match the BB? In typical scenario: SB posts 8, BB posts 16, then action goes to UTG. If everyone folds, then SB can check, BB can check. But here it's preflop and only SB and BB are left, and it's SB's turn? Actually after posting blinds, action goes to first player left of BB (UTG). If everyone folds, then SB gets first action. Since seat4 folded, seat5 (SB) would act first, but they already posted SB. So they can check or raise. Amount to call is 8 (the BB's 16? No, to call the BB's 16 you need to put 8 more). So we need to call 8 to match BB's 16. So we can call 8, raise to 32 (total), or fold.\n\nOur hand 9-J off-suit is not strong enough to raise here, especially against a player who may be willing to defend with a wide range. But we are short stack 17BB, still enough to play.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to raise preflop when they are in BB? Actually they have been raising when they are in BB? Not sure. But they have been raising 3bb when they are BB? Could be they raise from BB as a continuation after being first to act? Actually they are BB, they posted 16, then they might raise preflop (like a raise after SB). But here they just posted BB, no raise.\n\nWe can call 8 and see flop. 9-J suited? Actually unsuited. Might be okay to limp? But we have 17BB, we can limp and see flop",

Actually we are BB, they posted BB 16, we posted SB 8? Wait position: we are BB seat5, they are seat1 (maybe UTG?). Preflop actions: seat5 post_sb 8 (so we are small blind). seat1 post_bb 16 (big blind). So we are SB, they are BB. Both check flop. So on turn, amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. Opponent's tendencies on turn: from recall, they often check or fold, rarely raise. They have raised on turn once (hand 25) amount 72, maybe with strong hand. They also called a 4 bet on turn (hand 16). So they can be passive but sometimes aggressive.\n\nOur hand is weak. No pair, no draw. Turn is 4h, board now Kc 3c 7c 4h. Pot 32. Our stack 264, opponent 437. We are short stacked relative to opponent but still 16.5 BB. We are out of position (SB vs BB). Should we check and hope they check? Likely they will check. Checking is safe. Raising would be a bluff; but with only J high, not a good bluff against a player who may call with decent Kx or even a pair. Could we try a small raise to steal? Minimum raise to 16, which is 16 total (so raise of 16?). Actually raise to 16 means we put total 16 chips? Since amount to call 0, raise to 16 would be a bet of 16 chips. Pot is 32, bet 16 is 0.5 pot. Might get called by Kx, or they may fold weaker. But risk losing stack if they have Kx. Our hand is weak, so better to check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nWe need JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We are on river, board: Kc 3c 7c 4h Tc. Our hand: 9d Js. So we have a straight? Let's see: board has Kc 3c 7c 4h Tc. Our cards: 9d Js. Combined we have J9. The board has T, K, 3,7,4. Straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K? We have 9 and J, board has T and K, missing Q. No Q, so not straight. Flush? Board has three clubs (Kc,3c,7c). Our cards: 9d Js, no clubs, so no flush. Pair? We have J, board has J? No. Board has T, we have J, no pair. So high card J. Board highest card is K. So we have J high, board K high. So we are likely losing unless opponent also has nothing better? But opponent could have K, etc. So we should consider check or raise? Amount to call 0, pot 32. Opponent (Seat1 Kimi-K2) has 437 chips. He checked earlier on turn and river? Actually actions: preflop: seat1 posted bb 16, seat5 call 8, seat1 check. Flop both check, turn both check. River: we have amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. So opponent hasn't acted on river yet; it's our turn? Actually order: Since seat1 is in BB, seat5 is SB. Preflop SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then SB called 8, BB checked. So after flop, turn, river, the action order is SB first (seat5), then BB (seat1). So on river, seat5 acts first. So we can check or raise. If we raise, we risk being called by a better hand. Our hand is weak. So likely check and hope opponent checks and we lose small pot. But maybe we could bluff? Opponent's stack is 437, pot 32. If we raise to, say, 32 (all-in?), we could steal. But our stack is 264, can raise up to maybe 32 min raise? Minimum raise is 16 (to total 16). Actually current bet is 0, min raise is 16 (to 16). We could raise to 16, 32, etc. But we have 264, can raise any amount. But is opponent likely to fold? He might have a king, or a pair, or a straight draw? Board: Kc 3c 7c 4h Tc. He could have a king, or a pair of tens, or a flush draw missed, etc. He could also have a straight draw like QJ? Actually QJ would be a straight (J-Q-K). Wait board has K and T, QJ would be QJ K T? That's not a straight. Straight combos: 9-10-J-Q-K needs Q and 9. He could have Q9 for straight, but board has T and K, need J and Q? Actually 9-10-J-Q-K includes 9,10,J,Q,K. Board has K and T, we have J9, missing Q. Opponent could have Q9, they'd have Q9 + board K T => Q-K? Not a straight. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q: board has 10, we have J, need 8 and Q. Not there. So straight unlikely. So opponent likely has at least a pair of K, T, or maybe a flush draw missed. So raising may get called.\n\nThus best is to check. Reason: weak hand, low chance to win, risk losing more chips. Checking loses only pot 32. So output check.\n\n",

Actually we have J9, board has T, so we have a gutshot straight draw: 9-J gives us 9-10-J, need Q or 8? Let's see possible straight: 9-10-J-Q-K would need Q. Or 7-8-9-10-J would need 8. We have neither. So we have just J high plus a pair? No pair. We have J high, plus we have a backdoor flush? Board has three clubs, we have no clubs. So we have nothing, just J high (or maybe a gutshot draw that missed). Opponent bet 52 into pot 84, so pot now 84+52 = 136 (if we call). Our stack 264, we can call.\n\nWe need to consider opponent's tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking has only checked river previously in many hands. In this hand they bet 52. Could be bluff or value. What could they have? Board: Kc 3c 7c 4h Tc. Possible holdings: K high (Kx), T, maybe a straight draw, maybe a flush draw (clubs). They could have a hand like Kc Tc (two pair), or a set? No set possible (no pair on board). Could be a straight like QJ (but board has T, so QJ would make straight Q-J-10-9-8? No). Actually board has K, T, 3, 7, 4. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q (needs 8 and Q). Not present. So no straight on board. So only made hands are pairs: K, T, maybe two pair K+T? Actually board has K and T, each single. So if opponent has Kx, they'd have pair of K; if Tx they'd have pair of T; if they have both K and T they'd have two pair. Also could have a flush draw that missed. Could have a club like Ac for Ace-high flush draw but missed. Could have a straight draw missed.\n\nGiven they bet 52 (about 62% of pot), could be value bet with K, T, or two pair. Could be bluff. How often does Kimi-K2 Thinking bluff? Past river actions show they always checked, never bet. So maybe they are passive and only bet when they have value. So likely they have a decent hand.\n\nOur hand is weak: J high, no pair. So we should fold.\n\nCheck stack: 264 chips, 16.5 BB, tournament early? Might need to preserve chips. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

We are BTN, after SB and BB posted, it's our turn. Amount to call 16 (BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise by at least 16). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nConsider hand: Ace-4 offsuit, not great. In BTN, can steal blinds often, but our stack is short (16.5 BB). Opponents: Kimi-K2 Thinking (SB) has been raising preflop often? Data shows raise to 24 (i.e., 3BB) in several hands, and one raise to 48 (6BB). That suggests they are aggressive, maybe 3-betting? Actually those are their actions preflop: raise from SB? Wait seat1 is SB, they posted 8, then they raise? The data shows raise amounts 24, 48. That suggests they are raising (maybe 3-betting) after someone else? Not sure. But they are aggressive.\n\nMiniMax-M2 (BB) unknown.\n\nOur stack 264 chips, 16.5 BB. The blinds are 8/16, so effective stacks are shallow. If we call 16, we will be left with 248 chips, still decent. If we raise to 32 (i.e., 2x BB), we are putting 32 total, meaning raise 16 more. That would be a 2BB raise (standard). With Ace-4 offsuit, not strong enough to raise maybe. But stealing from SB and BB might be okay. However SB is aggressive and may 3-bet. Our stack is short, but we could go all-in? Minimum raise to 32 is okay; we could also go all-in (264) but that would be huge relative to pot.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, we might just call and see flop, but calling is like limping; in BTN it's okay but with short stack maybe we want to steal. However Ace-4 offsuit is not great for 3-bet, but could be a steal. But if SB is aggressive and may re-raise, we risk being 3-bet and losing chips. Our stack is 16.5 BB, we can afford a raise.\n\nI think best is to raise to 48 (i.e., 3BB) to apply pressure? But min raise is 32. Raising to 32 is standard. Considering SB's aggressiveness, a raise may be called or re-raised. But we have limited chips; if they 3-bet, we may be forced all-in anyway.\n\nGiven the hand is weak, maybe just call and hope to see cheap flop? But calling 16 invests 1BB; if we miss flop, we can fold later. With short stack, we want to preserve chips; limping is okay.\n\nThus decision: call.\n\nReasoning: Weak hand, short stack, SB aggressive, better to just call and see flop, preserve stack.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on river. Board: T\u2660 J\u2660 6c 7c 4h. Our hand: A\u2665 4\u2660. So we have pair of fours (board has 4h). Actually we have a pair of fours with kicker A. Board: T,J,6,7,4. So we have two pair? No, we have pair of fours, board has no other pair. So we have pair, low. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) checked river. So they likely have weak hand or drawing? Let's consider possible hands: Could have straight? Board: T,J,6,7,4. Straight possible: 8-9? No. 8-9 would need 8 and 9, not present. 9-8? Not. 5-8? Not. So no straight possible. Flush? Board has two clubs (6c,7c) and two spades (Ts,Js). No flush possible with 5 cards? Need 3 clubs or 3 spades among hole+board. Opponent could have two clubs for flush draw but board only has two clubs, need one more club in hand for flush, but they'd need 5 clubs total, not possible (only 2 clubs on board, need 3 in hand, impossible). So no flush. So best possible hand is two pair, trips, or full house. Board: T,J,6,7,4. No pair on board. So opponent could have a pair on board (like T, J, 6, 7) but they need a pocket pair to have pair? Actually they'd need a card matching board rank: e.g., T? they'd have T? That gives them pair of tens with kicker J? Actually they'd have two pair if they have a T and a J? But board has T and J each single. So if opponent holds T and J, they'd have two pair (T,J). That would beat our pair of fours. Also any higher pair like A, K, Q, etc? They could have A? they'd have pair of A's? No board doesn't have A. So they could have a higher pair like A? they'd need A on board, not there. So they'd need a pair in hand (e.g., 9-9) that would be just a pair, but lower than our A kicker? Actually pair 9s would be higher than our pair of fours, because pair of 9s beats pair of 4s. So many possible hands beat us. But opponent checked, maybe they think they are weak. Our hand is weak. So best to check. Could also consider bluff raise? Stack sizes: we have 248 chips, opponent 237. Pot 40. Minimum raise is 16. Raising to 16 would be a small raise (to 16 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 16 means we bet 16). That is about 40% of pot. Could be a semi-bluff? But opponent likely has better hand; they'd call and we lose chips. So better to check and fold if they bet later (but they checked). So choose check.\n\nThus output JSON with action check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

But typical play: SB may raise or limp? In this hand, SB posted SB (8) and hasn't acted yet. Actually actions: SB posted 8, BB posted 16. So SB hasn't acted yet; it's our turn after BB? Actually order: SB, BB, then BTN. So SB is first to act preflop (post SB). But they posted blind; they have the option to raise (or check). Since they posted blind, they can check (i.e., call 0) or raise. But the action is now at us, meaning SB and BB have not acted beyond posting blinds. So we can either call the BB (16) or raise. If we raise, SB and BB will have to act.\n\nGiven J8 suited, we could consider a steal raise. With 15.5 BB, we could raise to 48 (3x BB) maybe. But need to consider risk: If SB or BB re-raise all-in, we could be in trouble. Our stack is 248, raise to 48 leaves us 200 left, still enough.\n\nBut also could just call and see flop in position.

          "reasoning_content": "We have flop: 4d 7d 6d, board is a flush draw (diamonds) and also open-ended straight draw (5 and 8 give straight). Our hand: Jh 8h. So we have gutshot? Actually we have 8h, not diamond, so we have a gutshot straight draw (need 5 for straight 4-5-6-7-8). Also we have a backdoor flush draw (two hearts). Our opponent MiniMax-M2 checked. Stack sizes: we have 200 chips, opponent 221 chips. Pot 104. No bet. We are on button, we raised preflop to 48 (so we have some aggression). Opponent called 32 preflop.\n\nNow flop: opponent checks. Options: check, bet (raise). Minimum raise is 32 (so raise to at least 32? Actually raise to total 32? The min raise is 32 which is the amount to raise total? Usually min raise is current bet + 2*big blind? But here they say minimum raise to: 32. So we can raise to 32 total? That would be a raise of 32 (i.e., bet 32). Since no bet, raising to 32 means bet 32.\n\nWe need to decide: do we bet? Hand is a draw, not strong. Pot 104, bet 32 gives pot odds to opponent about 32/(104+32)=23.5% required to call. Opponent has about 221 chips, could call. If opponent is tight, might fold. If opponent is loose, may call.\n\nWe should consider opponent tendencies: recall shows they often check on flop, sometimes call a bet. In recent hands, they checked and sometimes folded after bet? Not shown. They have a pattern of checking. Could be passive.\n\nWe have position, decent stack, can try to take pot now with semi-bluff. Our hand has both straight and backdoor flush draws, plus we have some equity (~12%? Actually open-ended? We have gutshot straight draw (8, need 5) and backdoor flush (needs two diamonds). So about 12%? Might be okay to bet as semi-bluff.\n\nBut we also could check and see turn. Turn will be unknown. If we check, we give free card. Turn could give us straight or flush draw. Could be good. However, checking may allow opponent to bet if they have a pair, etc.\n\nGiven we are short stack 12.5 BB, we might want to be aggressive to pick up pot now rather than risk later. But we also have limited chips; we could go all-in? Minimum raise is 32, but we could raise more. Our stack 200, we could raise to say 120 (half pot) to apply pressure. But we need to consider risk.\n\nOpponent stack similar, but they are behind us preflop raise. They may have a range: could have a diamond, could have a pair, could have a straight draw.\n\nGiven board is all diamonds, opponent may have a flush draw. If we bet, we risk being called by flush draw that beats us. But we also have equity.\n\nI think a semi-bluff raise to about 80 (pot+bet) could be good. However, we have limited chips; raising to 80 still leaves us with 120. Could be okay.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot bet less than min raise 32. Could raise to 80. That is a raise.\n\nThus decision: raise to 80. Reason: semi-bluff with straight and backdoor flush draw, protect against free cards, leverage position.\n\nI'll output JSON.",

No diamonds except 4d 7d 6d. We have two hearts, but board has no hearts. So we have a flush draw? No, need 2 more hearts, we have two hearts, need 3 hearts on board, not possible. So no flush. Straight possibilities: board is 4-6-7-10. We have J8. Could make straight with 9? Let's see combos: 6-7-8-9-10 would be straight, we have 8, need 9 on river. Also 7-8-9-10-J would be straight, need 9 also. So we have an open-ended straight draw? Actually we have 8 and J, board has 6,7,10. The possible straight draws: need 9 for both. Also need 5 for 4-5-6-7-8? We have 8, need 5. So we have two outs (9 and 5). Actually 5 also works: 4-5-6-7-8, yes we have 8, need 5. So we have two outs: 5 and 9 (four each = 8 outs). Not huge.\n\nWe have bet on flop 80 into pot 264? Actually pot before flop bet: preflop pot: we raised to 48, opponent called 32, so pot = 48+32+ blinds? Blinds 8+16=24, so total preflop pot 104? Wait compute: SB 8, BB 16, raise to 48 (so total put by us 48), opponent call 32 (they already posted 16, so they add 16 more? Actually call 32 means they put total 32, but they already posted 16, so they add 16). So pot after preflop: SB 8 + BB 16 + our 48 + opponent 32 = 104. Flop bet 80 from us, opponent called 80, so pot now 104 + 80*2 = 264. Yes.\n\nTurn: opponent checked. So pot is 264, we have 120 chips left total, we have already invested: preflop 48, flop 80 = 128. Stack left 120.\n\nNow turn we have option to check or raise. Minimum raise to 80 (so raise to 80 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in? The raise minimum is 80, meaning we need to put total bet 80? But we have already 0 to call, so raising to 80 means we put 80 chips. That would be a bet of 80 into pot 264, about 30% of pot. Our stack is 120, we could raise to 80 (leaving 40). Could also go all-in 120.\n\nConsider opponent: MiniMax-M2 with 141 chips left. He checked turn after we bet flop 80 and he called. He likely has a hand that can call flop but not confident on turn. Could be a pair like T, 6, 7, 4, maybe a draw. Our hand Jh8h has some equity but not strong.\n\nWe need tournament considerations: we are short stack 7.5 BB, need to accumulate chips. Opponent has 141 chips, about 9 BB. So both are short. Should we try to steal? Our hand is not strong enough to value bet, but we could try to bluff. Turn board: 4d 7d 6d Ts. No hearts, no obvious draws. Our bet on flop could have represented a strong hand like a set or two pair? But board is rainbow, no flush draws. Our flop bet of 80 into 104 pot (80% pot) is fairly strong. Opponent called, maybe they have a hand like T9, 87, 76, etc. He checked turn, maybe he missed a draw.\n\nIf we check turn, we give free river, likely lose if opponent bets. Could also check and hope river card hits our straight draw (5 or 9). But we have 8 outs, pot 264, bet 0, opponent could bet. If they bet, we might call with draws? Not great.\n\nBetter to try a semi-bluff raise? Our hand has some equity (8 outs) so a raise could be both a bluff and a value bet if opponent has a weak hand like middle pair. Minimum raise is 80, we could raise to 80 (which is a bet of 80). That is a small"

We have open-ended straight draw? 6-7-8-9-10 would be straight, we have 8 and J, board has 9, T, so we have 8-9-T-J? That's not a straight. Actually we have 8, J. Board has 9, T. So we have 8-9-10-J, need 7 or Q for straight. Board has 7, so we have 7-8-9-10-J = straight! Yes we have 7 (board), 8 (hand), 9 (board), T (board), J (hand) = 7-8-9-10-J = Broadway? That's a straight to J (Jack-high). So we have a straight, J-high. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has 61 chips, check-checked river. Pot is 424. We have 40 chips left, all-in would be 40 (all chips). Legal actions are fold, check only (cannot raise because minimum raise 80 > stack). So we can only check (i.e., call 0) or fold. We should check to see showdown. Straight vs opponent's possible hands. Opponent could have higher straight? Highest possible straight on board: 6-7-8-9-10? That would be 10-high straight. But board has 4d 7d 6d Ts 9c. To have 10-high straight they'd need 8 and 5? Actually 5-6-7-8-9 = 9-high. 6-7-8-9-10 = 10-high. Opponent could have 8 and 5? That gives 5-6-7-8-9 = 9-high, lower. To get 10-high they'd need 8 and 5? No, 6-7-8-9-10 uses 6,7,8,9,10. They have 6 and 7 on board, need 8 and 9 on board, which are present, but need 10 also board. Actually board has 6,7,9,10. So need 8 to complete. Opponent could have 8 and any card, they'd have 6-7-8-9-10 straight (10-high). Our hand has J, which is higher than 10. So we have higher straight (J-high) than 10-high. Could opponent have higher straight like Q? Board doesn't have Q. To have Q-high they'd need K Q J 10 9 etc, not possible. Could opponent have a flush? Board has three diamonds, opponent could have two diamonds for flush, but we have no diamond, so they'd have flush higher than our straight. Flush would beat straight. Could they have full house? Board has 4,6,7,9,10. No pair on board. They could have pair in hand matching board to make trips, but they'd need pair like 9-9 etc, would give trips, which beats straight.

But legal actions only include fold, call, not raise. So we can call (which will be all-in). So decision: call (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, decent hand but not premium, need to gamble.

Let's enumerate: With board T,5,7,J. The ranks present: 5,7,10,J. To make a straight we need 8 and 9 (8-9-10-J-Q? No Q missing). Actually 8-9-10-J-Q would need Q, not present. Another possibility: 6-8-9-10-J? That's 6-8-9-10-J, missing 6,8,9. Not possible. So we have no straight draw currently. We have pair Jacks, Ace kicker. Potential flush? Board has two diamonds (Td,5d). Our hand has Ah (heart) Jh (heart). No flush draw.\n\nOpponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) is in the big blind? Actually seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2, they posted BB? Wait seat 3 posted bb 2. So they are BB? Actually seat 3 posted bb 2 (they are BB). Seat 5 is us (GPT-OSS-120B). We raised preflop to 6, they called 4 (so they had 2 blind then called 4 more). Flop: board T 5d 7h. They checked, we bet 4, they called. Turn: board J s (Jack of spades). They checked. Now we have action, amount to call 0, min raise 4, legal: fold, check, raise.\n\nWe have top pair (Jacks) with Ace kicker, but opponent could have also J? They could have J? Actually there is J on board, we have Jh, they could have J? There are three Jacks left: Js on board, Jh we hold, Jc and Jd unknown. They could have a higher kicker like AQ, KQ, etc. Could have a set? They could have TT? No board has T, they could have T? Actually board has T, they could have TT for set of tens, but they'd need two tens; one ten on board, there are three remaining tens: Td is board, so other tens: Tc, Th, Ts. They could have two of those, but that's unlikely. Could have a straight draw? Not now.\n\nOur hand is decent but not monster. Opponent checked on turn after we bet on flop. That could indicate weakness or they are slow playing a strong hand like a set, two pair, maybe a straight draw (but none). Could be they have a hand like QJ (but we have Jh). Actually they could have QJ (JQ) giving top pair with Q kicker. Could also have AJ (but we have Ah, they could have Ad? Actually we have Ah, they could have Ad, giving them pair of Aces? No board has no Ace. So they could have A? Not relevant.\n\nWe need to decide action: check or raise. Considering pot size: after flop, pot was 21. Flop betting: we bet 4, opponent called 4, so pot after flop = 21 + 4+4 = 29? Actually preflop pot: we raised to 6, they called 4, plus blinds 1+2 = 3? Let's compute: blinds 1+2 = 3. Preflop: we raised to 6 (so we put 6 total, including BB 2? Actually we are BB, posted 2, then raise to 6 means extra 4). Opponent called 4 (they posted 2 blind then call 4). So total preflop contributions: SB 1 folded, BB 2 posted, then raise to 6 (so BB total 6), opponent call 6 total (2 blind + 4). So pot after preflop = 1 (SB) + 2 (BB) + 4 extra from BB + 4 extra from opponent = 11? Wait compute: SB 1 (folded) but contributed 1. BB posted 2 then added 4 = 6. Opponent posted"

Raising could get value from weaker hands like KQ, Q9, etc. But risk: opponent could have a set (TT) and would raise? Actually they checked, maybe they are slow playing a set. Raising could get them to call with set? They might call, but we would lose more chips. Considering stack 190, pot currently? Let's compute pot after turn before action: Preflop pot 11 (maybe). Flop: bet 4, call 4 = 8 added, pot = 19? Actually after flop, pot before betting was 11. Then we bet 4, opponent call 4, pot becomes 11+8 = 19. Turn card J added to board, no bet yet, pot stays 19. Now it's our turn with amount to call 0. So pot is 19. If we raise to 4 (minimum), we would add 4 more, pot 23. Opponent may call or fold.\n\nGiven we have top pair, maybe we should bet for value. But opponent checked, could be weak, we can extract value. However risk of set? Set of tens would be very strong; they'd likely bet, not check. But they might check to trap. In tournament with 95 BB, we can afford a raise.\n\nThus I think raise to 8 (double) maybe? Minimum raise is 4 (to total 4? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in this round. Since amount to call is 0, raise_to is the total we commit this street. Minimum raise to 4 means we must put at least 4 chips. So raise_to could be 8 to apply pressure.

          "reasoning_content": "We are on the flop. Board: Tc 3d Jh. Our hand: Jc Ad. So we have top pair (Jacks) with a gutshot straight draw (need Q for straight) and also Ace high kicker. Also we have a backdoor flush draw? No clubs: we have Jc and Ad, board has Tc (clubs) and Jh (hearts) and 3d. So we have two clubs? Actually Jc is club, board Tc is club, so we have a flush draw with two clubs (Jc and Tc). Need two more clubs for flush, but we have one club in hand and one on board; we need two more clubs on turn and river. That's a backdoor flush draw.\n\nOpponent is Kimi-K2 seat1? Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (maybe the same opponent). Seat1 called preflop. So we have a heads-up pot with us (BB) and opponent (Seat1). Pot size 19 chips. No bet to call on flop, amount to call 0. Minimum raise to 6 (so raise to total of 6? Actually raise to total amount? Since we are in BB, we have already posted 2, but raise to 6 means total bet of 6? Usually min raise is 6 total (i.e., raise to 6). So we can raise to 6, which would be 6 chips total in pot from us, meaning we add 4 chips? Actually we have already contributed 2 preflop, but flop betting starts fresh. So raising to 6 means we put 6 chips into pot now.\n\nOur stack 203. We have top pair. Opponent's range: could have many combos: maybe overpairs (QQ, KK, AA), sets (TT, JJ), two pair (TJ), straight draws (QK), etc. Board is T,J,3. Opponent could have T? Actually board has T and J, so opponent could have T? They could have T9 for two pair? Actually board has T and J, so two pair would be TT or JJ combos (set) or maybe they have JT for trips? Actually they have J? If they have J? they'd have trips. They could have KQ for straight draw? Actually KQ would need QJ? Wait board T J, need Q K for straight? The board is T,J,3. Straight possibilities: A K Q? Actually need 9-10-J? No. Straight draws: 9-10-J? board has T J, need 9 and Q? Actually a straight with board T,J would be 9-10-J-Q-K? No. The board only has two cards. So they could have Q9 for open-ended? Not yet. So they could have Q9 (needs 8 or K) not relevant.\n\nOur hand is decent. With no bet, we could check to pot control, but we have top pair and we are the aggressor preflop (raised). Might want to bet for value. However we need to consider opponent's tendencies: unknown. They called preflop. Could be wide. Since we are BB with A J, we have strong hand. Betting could extract value from weaker Jacks, tens, etc. But also could be overbet? The pot is 19. A bet of 6 (min raise) is about 0.3 pot, small. Could also raise bigger.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. No bet action? In flop, we can check or raise (bet). So we can bet 6 minimum.\n\nGiven we have top pair, we should bet for value. Opponent might call with worse Jacks (like Jx), tens, etc. Also could raise with sets. But raising bigger could risk. A small bet may get called by many.\n\nThus choose raise to 6 (i.e., bet 6). Reasoning: top pair, decent kicker, want value, pot small.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Our hand: Jc Ad gives us pair of Jacks (we have two Jacks: Jc and board J\u2665, plus also top pair with Ace kicker? Actually we have pair of Jacks, plus Ace high. Also we have a straight? Board: T, J, 5, 3. With Ace we don't have straight. Could we have a flush? No. So we have two pair (Jacks and Tens?

Actually we have Jc and board J\u2665 => pair of Jacks. Also board has Ten, giving us Jacks over Ten kicker? Not two pair. So we have a pair of Jacks, which is top pair (since board has Ten). Opponent (Seat 1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 186. He called preflop, then called flop bet 6. So he likely has something like maybe a straight draw or a pair. On turn, board is 5s, which likely doesn't change much. Pot is 31 chips. We are in BB, after flop bet 6, opponent called, so pot 31 includes our 6 bet, his 6 call, plus previous preflop and blinds. Now it's our turn? Actually after flop, we bet 6, opponent called, then turn action: it's our turn? The sequence: preflop we raised, opponent called. Flop we bet, opponent called. Turn: we are first to act (since we were the aggressor preflop and flop). So we have amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 6 (so raise must be at least to 12 total? Actually raise to 6 means total? Usually minimum raise is bet + previous bet? But they say minimum raise to: 6. That likely means total amount you put in must be at least 6 more than current bet? But amount to call is 0, so raise must be at least 6 chips (so total bet 6). So we can bet 6 (which would be a continuation bet). We need to decide.\n\nOur hand: top pair Jacks, decent but board is fairly dry: T,3,J,5. No flush draws, no straight draws now (possible straight draws: 9-8? Not present). Opponent could have Ten, could have Ace? Actually Ace we have. He could have T9 for a straight? Not possible. He could have pocket tens (TT) for set? Actually board has one Ten, so TT would be set of tens. That would be strong. He could have J9 for two pair? Actually J9 would give him Jacks pair with nine kicker, same as us but we have Ace kicker, so we beat him. He could have AQ for top pair Ace? Not board. He could have KQ for straight? No.\n\nPotential opponent holdings: He called preflop raise of 8 from BB, so his range includes many hands: broadways, suited connectors, pairs, etc. He called flop bet of 6 on a board T3J. He could have a pair like TT, JJ, 99, etc. He could have a straight draw like Q9? Not on board. Could have a flush draw? No clubs? Board clubs: Tc, no other clubs. He could have clubs for flush draw? Only one club on board, need 2 more clubs. Not likely. So likely he has a hand like a pair, maybe a weak Ace, maybe a gutshot? Not many draws.\n\nOur hand is decent but vulnerable to TT set, or maybe a straight? Not possible. So we can consider betting for value, but also risk being raised by a set. Our stack is 197, opponent 186. Pot 31. If we bet 6, we risk being raised to larger amount. If we check, we give him free card, but could give him chance to improve.\n\nGiven top pair Jacks with Ace kicker, we want value but also protect against draws? No draws. So a small bet to get value from worse Jacks, Tens, lower pairs, maybe Ace high? He may call with Ace high? He might call a small bet with Ace high? Possibly. He could also raise with TT set.\n\nWhat is tournament context? Not given, but stack sizes moderate relative to blinds (1/2). 197 chips is ~98 BB, deep stack.

If we check, we give him free card, but could give him chance to improve.\n\nGiven top pair Jacks with Ace kicker, we want value but also protect against draws? No draws. So a small bet to get value from worse Jacks, Tens, lower pairs, maybe Ace high? He may call with Ace high? He might call a small bet with Ace high? Possibly. He could also raise with TT set.\n\nWhat is tournament context? Not given, but stack sizes moderate relative to blinds (1/2). 197 chips is ~98 BB, deep stack. So we can afford to be cautious.\n\nGiven opponent's previous call, he might have",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on river. Board: Tc 3d Jh 5s Th. So board is Ten of clubs, 3 diamonds, Jack hearts, 5 spades, Ten hearts. That's a full house? Actually we have two tens and a jack on board: Tens pair, Jack singleton. Board: T\u2663 3\u2666 J\u2665 5\u2660 T\u2665. So board is two pair (Tens and ??? Actually only tens pair, no other pair). So board is pair of tens. River is after turn? Wait actions listed: flop bet 6, call, turn bet 6, call. Now river action? It says amount to call 0, minimum raise 6, legal actions: fold, check, raise. So it's our turn on river, after turn betting, we are in BB. No one else acted on river yet. So we have Jc Ad. Our hand: Jc (Jack clubs) and Ace diamonds? Actually Ad is Ace diamonds. So we have Jc Ad. On board we have J\u2665 and T\u2663 T\u2665. So we have top pair (Jack) with Ace kicker? Actually we have a pair of Jacks (our Jc with board J\u2665) and also we have Ace high. So we have pair of Jacks, not a full house. Opponent (Seat1 Kimi) has unknown hand. They called preflop and both flop and turn bets. They may have a ten, maybe a jack, maybe a straight draw? Board: T,3,J,5,T. Possible hands: two pair tens+? maybe they have 10x for trips, or Jx for two pair Jacks+Tens? Actually board has two tens, one jack. If opponent has a jack, they'd have two pair (Jacks and Tens). If they have a ten, they'd have trips (three tens). If they have a straight? Board: T-3-J-5-T. Straight possibilities: 9-8-7-6-5? No. 8-9-10-J-Q? Need Q and 9. Not there. So no straight. Flush? No two clubs or hearts? Board has clubs T\u2663, hearts J\u2665, hearts T\u2665. Two hearts, one club. Opponent could have heart flush draw but not completed. So likely they have a ten (trips) or a jack (two pair). Could also have a 3 for a set? No, board only one 3. So set of 3s not possible. Could have a full house with a ten and a jack? If they have T? they'd have trips. If they have J? they'd have two pair. If they have Ace? they'd have Ace high, not likely call. They called both bets, suggests decent hand. Our hand Jc Ad is just a pair of Jacks, worse than two pair or trips. So we should probably fold unless we think they are bluffing. River bet? Actually we have amount to call 0, meaning no bet yet. So we can check or raise. If we think they will bet later, we could check and hope they bet? But they are the only other player. It's our turn, we can check to give them opportunity to bet. If we think they have a strong hand, we shouldn't raise. So likely check.\n\nBut could we consider raising as a bluff? Our hand is weak relative to board. Opponent may think we have a strong hand (like a ten) and we could bluff. But risk: they may call or raise. Our stack is 191, pot 43. Minimum raise is 6, so raise to 6? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Minimum raise to 6 means we need to put total 6? Actually we have already contributed previous bets? On river we haven't bet yet. So raising to 6 would be a bet of 6. That's small. Could be a thin bluff. But opponent may have a weak hand like missed draws, could call. But they called previous bets, so they likely have a decent hand. Probably best to check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

          "content": "We have board: Js Jh 7h 2s. Our hand: Td Jc. So we have top pair Jacks with a gutshot? Actually we have pair of Jacks (two Jacks on board, we have Jc, so we have three of a kind? Wait board: Js Jh. That's two Jacks. We have Jc, so we have three Jacks (trips). Also we have Td, giving us a straight draw? Board: Js Jh 7h 2s. Our Td gives us a straight draw? The board has J J 7 2. With Td we have Ten, so we have Ten-Jack-Jack. That's a pair of Jacks plus a Ten kicker. Not a straight. Could we have a straight with 9? Not. So we have three of a kind (trips). That's a strong hand.\n\nOpponent (seat 3) checked the turn. So they likely have something like a Jack (but they'd have at least a pair maybe). They could have a hand like Jx, maybe a set of 7? Actually board has two Jacks. If opponent had a Jack, they'd have trips as well (maybe bigger kicker). But they could also have a flush draw? Board has hearts: Js, Jh, 7h, 2s. Two hearts on board. Our hand has no heart, so flush draw not possible for us. Opponent could have heart draw like Ah Kh. They would have missed the flop but have flush draw (two hearts on board, need two more hearts). Actually they need 2 hearts in hand to have a flush draw (two hearts on board, need 3 more hearts). With only two hearts on board, you need two hearts in hand to have a flush draw (nut flush draw). So maybe they have Ah Kh, they'd have a gutshot? Not.\n\nGiven opponent's actions: preflop they called our raise 6 (they had 2 big blind). So they called 4 (they posted 2, then call 4). On flop they checked to us, we bet 8, they called. So they have some hand but not strong enough to raise. Turn they checked again. So they likely have a middle pair, maybe a Jack with weak kicker, or a pair of 7s, or a straight draw? The board is paired Jacks, so many hands are dead. Our trips are likely best.\n\nPot size: 29 chips before turn action? Actually after flop betting: pot was 29 after flop? Let's compute: preflop: we raised to 6, they called 4 (since they already had 2 blind?), Actually preflop: seat 2 posted SB 1, seat 3 posted BB 2, seat 4 folded, seat 5 raise 6 (so raise to 6 total). So seat 2 folded, seat 3 call 4 (since they already have 2, need 4 more). So pot after preflop: 1+2+6+4 = 13? Wait seat 5 raise 6 means they put 6 total, not additional. So seat 5 contributed 6. Seat 3 contributed 2 (bb) + 4 call = 6 total. SB folded. So pot = 6+6 =12? plus maybe other blinds? Actually SB 1 folded, so not in pot. So pot = 12. Then flop: seat 3 check, seat5 bet 8, seat3 call 8. So pot adds 8+8 =16, total pot = 28. But given pot listed as 29 after flop? maybe rounding. Anyway.\n\nNow turn: seat3 check, amount to call 0. Minimum raise to 8. So we can check or raise. If we check, we give free card. Board: Js Jh 7h 2s, turn is unknown (the turn card just came, we are at turn action). Actually board includes turn card already: Js Jh 7h 2s (that's 4 cards). So we are acting after turn card is dealt. So we have trips. The opponent checked. Should we bet? Likely yes to protect against straight draws? Are there any straight draws? Board: J J 7 2. Possible straight draws: 8-9-10? Actually need 5 consecutive cards. With J,J,7,2, you could have a straight with 8-9-10? No, you need 5 cards: e.g., 8-9-10-J-J? That's not a straight because you need distinct ranks. So possible straight draw: 9-10-J-Q-K? Not possible with board. So there are no real straight draws. However there could be a flush draw if two hearts on board, need two hearts in hand. Opponent could have two hearts, giving them a flush draw"

          "reasoning_content": "We have board: Js Jh 7h 2s. Our hand: Td Jc. So we have top pair Jacks with a gutshot? Actually we have pair of Jacks (two Jacks on board, we have Jc, so we have three of a kind? Wait board: Js Jh. That's two Jacks. We have Jc, so we have three Jacks (trips). Also we have Td, giving us a straight draw? Board: Js Jh 7h 2s. Our Td gives us a straight draw? The board has J J 7 2. With Td we have Ten, so we have Ten-Jack-Jack. That's a pair of Jacks plus a Ten kicker. Not a straight. Could we have a straight with 9? Not. So we have three of a kind (trips). That's a strong hand.\n\nOpponent (seat 3) checked the turn. So they likely have something like a Jack (but they'd have at least a pair maybe). They could have a hand like Jx, maybe a set of 7? Actually board has two Jacks. If opponent had a Jack, they'd have trips as well (maybe bigger kicker). But they could also have a flush draw? Board has hearts: Js, Jh, 7h, 2s. Two hearts on board. Our hand has no heart, so flush draw not possible for us. Opponent could have heart draw like Ah Kh. They would have missed the flop but have flush draw (two hearts on board, need two more hearts). Actually they need 2 hearts in hand to have a flush draw (two hearts on board, need 3 more hearts). With only two hearts on board, you need two hearts in hand to have a flush draw (nut flush draw). So maybe they have Ah Kh, they'd have a gutshot? Not.\n\nGiven opponent's actions: preflop they called our raise 6 (they had 2 big blind). So they called 4 (they posted 2, then call 4). On flop they checked to us, we bet 8, they called. So they have some hand but not strong enough to raise. Turn they checked again. So they likely have a middle pair, maybe a Jack with weak kicker, or a pair of 7s, or a straight draw? The board is paired Jacks, so many hands are dead. Our trips are likely best.\n\nPot size: 29 chips before turn action? Actually after flop betting: pot was 29 after flop? Let's compute: preflop: we raised to 6, they called 4 (since they already had 2 blind?), Actually preflop: seat 2 posted SB 1, seat 3 posted BB 2, seat 4 folded, seat 5 raise 6 (so raise to 6 total). So seat 2 folded, seat 3 call 4 (since they already have 2, need 4 more). So pot after preflop: 1+2+6+4 = 13? Wait seat 5 raise 6 means they put 6 total, not additional. So seat 5 contributed 6. Seat 3 contributed 2 (bb) + 4 call = 6 total. SB folded. So pot = 6+6 =12? plus maybe other blinds? Actually SB 1 folded, so not in pot. So pot = 12. Then flop: seat 3 check, seat5 bet 8, seat3 call 8. So pot adds 8+8 =16, total pot = 28. But given pot listed as 29 after flop? maybe rounding. Anyway.\n\nNow turn: seat3 check, amount to call 0. Minimum raise to 8. So we can check or raise. If we check, we give free card. Board: Js Jh 7h 2s, turn is unknown (the turn card just came, we are at turn action). Actually board includes turn card already: Js Jh 7h 2s (that's 4 cards). So we are acting after turn card is dealt. So we have trips. The opponent checked. Should we bet? Likely yes to protect against straight draws? Are there any straight draws? Board: J J 7 2. Possible straight draws: 8-9-10? Actually need 5 consecutive cards. With J,J,7,2, you could have a straight with 8-9-10? No, you need 5 cards: e.g., 8-9-10-J-J? That's not a straight because you need distinct ranks. So possible straight draw: 9-10-J-Q-K? Not possible with board. So there are no real straight draws. However there could be a flush draw if two hearts on board, need two hearts in hand. Opponent could have two hearts, giving them a flush draw",

Actually board has two Jacks, we have one more Jack, so we have three of a kind (trip Jacks). Also board has a flush draw? Board suits: Js (spades), Jh (hearts), 7h (hearts), 2s (spades), 5s (spades). So three spades on board: Js, 2s,5s. That's a flush draw possible for opponent if they have two spades.

Opponent called 4 (so they had 2 in BB, then call 4). So pot after preflop: 6 (our raise) + 4 (call) + 1 (SB) + 2 (BB) = 13? Actually SB posted 1, BB posted 2 (post_bb). Then raise to 6 means we put total 6? Typically raise to 6 means we put 6 total, so we added 4 more after BB's 2. So total contributions: SB 1, BB 6 (including 2), Opponent 4, total = 11. But pot listed as 45 after flop and turn bets? Anyway.\n\nOpponent's actions: check flop, we bet 8, they call 8. Turn: they check, we bet 8, they call 8. So they are calling small bets. Could be they have a hand like a Jack (but they'd have 4 Jacks? Actually only 2 Jacks left; they could have Jx). Could be they have a flush draw (spades) and call. Could be they have a pair of something like 7s, 5s, etc. Could be they have a straight draw? Not likely.\n\nNow river: they check. We can check or raise. Should we value bet? Our trips are strong but board has possible flush (spades) and also possible full house? Actually board: Js Jh 7h 2s 5s. If opponent has a heart flush? Hearts: Jh and 7h only two hearts, need two hearts. Not possible. Spade flush: Js,2s,5s three spades, need two more spades in hand. Could be they have spade flush, they'd have made flush on river if they have two spades. They could have also have a full house: e.g., 7-7 or 5-5 gives full house sevens over Jacks? Actually board has pair Jacks, so if opponent has a 7, they'd have two pair (Jacks and sevens) not full house. Full house would be if they have a Jack (but we have the third Jack, only two left). They could have a 7 or 5 to make trips of those ranks? Not enough board. So best possible opponent hand: flush (spades) or maybe two pair with Jacks and something else. Or maybe a straight? Not possible. So our trips likely best.\n\nWe can consider raising for value. What is stack sizes? Opponent stack unknown but they have 167 chips. Pot is 45 chips. If we raise to say 30-40 we could get value. But opponent may call with weaker hands like Jx (but they'd have at least one Jack, but we have three Jacks, they could have a Jack making quads?

Both checked. Turn is 9s. Pot is 13 chips. It's our turn? Actually actions list: flop check by us then opponent. Now turn: we have action? The description says \"TURN\". So we are to act now. Opponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) is remaining with 115 chips. No bets yet on turn, amount to call is 0. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 4.\n\nWe have pocket sevens, board QJ39. No pair, no straight draw? We have a gutshot? The board: Q J 3 9. Straight possibilities: 8-10? Actually we have 7s, we could have a straight draw if a 8 appears (8 would give 9-10-J-Q? Wait need 5 consecutive. Current board: Q J 3 9. No consecutive. If a 8 appears, we would have 7-8-9-10-J? But we lack 10. So no. If a 10 appears, we have 9-10-J-Q, missing J? Actually we have J on board, Q, so 10 would give us J-10-9? Not a straight. So no straight draws. Flush? Two diamonds on board, we have clubs and spades, no flush draw.\n\nThus our hand is just a middle pair (sevens) which is likely weak. Opponent's range: preflop raise to 6 from UTG? Actually seat 3 raised 6 from position? We don't know seat positions, but seat 3 is likely UTG or MP. He raised preflop, we called. So his range is fairly strong: broadway cards, pairs, suited connectors, etc. Flop QJ3 is favorable to many of those. He checked flop. Could be weak or drawing. Turn 9 is also a card that could give him straight draws (like 10-8). He may bet now. Should we check and see? Our stack is large relative to pot (296 chips, pot 13). We can check, but risk losing later. Better to check and evaluate river. If opponent bets, we can decide to call or fold. Our hand is likely not best. So checking is safe.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nWe need JSON: action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Board is Q J 3 9, no straight draws? Let's analyze: board: Q J 3 9. Straight possibilities: Ten? T would give Q-J-10-9-8? Actually need 5 consecutive. Q-J-? Not. A straight draw? 8 would give 9-8-7-6-5? Not. We have 7s, could make a straight with 8-6-5-4? Not. So we have just a pair of 7s, which is currently the lowest pair on board (no 7 on board). Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 6 into pot 19, after checking on flop. So they are betting on turn. What could they have? Could be a made hand like QJ (two pair), maybe a set? No set possible because board has no pair. Could be a straight draw: they have T9? Actually board has 9 now, so T9 would give pair of 9s? Actually they would have a pair of 9s if they hold 9x. But 9 on board, they could have 9x for trips? No board only one 9. So they'd have pair of 9s if they have another 9. Could be a combo draw like J10 (open-ended straight draw: J-10-9-8-7). Board: Q J 3 9. With J10 you have pair of J and open-ended? Actually J10 would give pair of J and also straight draw? Need 8? J10 gives J-J? Actually J is on board, you have pair of J. Straight draw: 10-8? Not. Let's think: board: Q J 3 9. To have open-ended you need 10 and 8 for 8-9-10-J-Q straight. So a hand like 10-8 would be open-ended. Also a hand like K10 would give gutshot? K10 gives Q-J-10? Actually need 10-J-Q-K-A? Not. So many possibilities.\n\nOur hand: pocket 7s is weak. Likely we should fold. But consider stack sizes: we have 296 chips, opponent 109 chips. Opponent is short stack; they bet 6 (small relative to pot). Pot 19, bet 6, pot would be 25 if we call. Our stack is large, but opponent is short; they could be trying to steal blinds? They are in seat 3 (UTG? Actually seat 3 after seat 4 folded, seat 5 is BB). Preflop: seat 3 raised to 6 (so they are the raiser). So they are the aggressor preflop, and they checked flop, bet turn. Likely they have a hand like QJ (two pair), maybe a set? No set. Could be a pair of J, Q, or 9, or a straight draw, or a bluff. But with pocket 7s, we have low showdown value. Should we call? Pot odds: need 6 to win 25 (if call) => 6/25 = 24% equity needed. Our hand vs unknown? Probably less. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

Actually we have T and Q, board 5-6-7-9. Our hand: Td gives us 10, Qd gives us queen. With board 5-6-7-9, we have straight draw: need 8 to make 5-6-7-8-9 straight, or we have 10 gives us 6-7-8-9-10? Wait we don't have 8. We have 10 and queen. The board has 5,6,7,9. So we have 10, queen, plus board 5,6,7,9. Straight possibilities: 6-7-8-9-10 would need 8; 5-6-7-8-9 would need 8; also we have gutshot? Actually we have 10, queen, board 5,6,7,9. We have a gutshot draw to a straight? Let's enumerate combos: If a 8 appears, we have 5-6-7-8-9 straight (8 on board). If a Jack appears, we have 6-7-8-9-10? Wait we need 8 for that straight, not J. Actually 6-7-8-9-10 requires 8. So only 8 completes straight. Also a 8 would give us straight; also a queen? Already have queen; queen doesn't help. So we have an open-ended straight draw? Actually we have 5-6-7-9, we have 10, so we have 6-7-8-9-10 missing 8; we also have 5-6-7-8-9 missing 8. So yes we have a gutshot? No, it's an open-ended? Let's think: The straight draw is \"inside\" because only 8 works, not 4 or J. So it's a gutshot (inside) draw: need exactly one rank (8). So probability of hitting on river: 4 outs (four 8s) out of unseen cards. Unknown cards: total deck 52, we have 2, board 4 =6 known. Opponent unknown cards 2? Actually opponent has 2 unknown. So 52-6=46 unknown, 4 outs => ~8.7% chance.\n\nWe also have backdoor flush draw? Board has two diamonds: 6d,7d, our hand has Td Qd both diamonds, so we have a flush draw? Actually we have two diamonds in hand, board has two diamonds, so we have four diamonds total. Need one more diamond on river to make flush. So we have 9 diamonds total in deck (13 total diamonds - 4 we know =9). Opponent may have some diamonds but we consider unknown. So flush draw outs: 9 - opponent's possible diamonds (maybe 0-2). Approx 9 outs, ~19.5% chance.\n\nThus we have combined outs: straight 4, flush 9 (some overlap? 8 of diamonds also counts as straight? 8d is both straight and flush, counted twice. So total unique outs = 4 (8s) + 9 (diamonds) - 1 (8d) =12 outs. So about 12/46 = 26% chance to improve to strong hand.\n\nCurrent pot: 29 chips. No bet on turn yet; opponent checked, we have option to check or raise.\n\nOpponent: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) with 188 chips, checked turn after we bet flop. We bet 8 on flop, opponent called 8. So pot after flop bet: Preflop pot: we raised to 6, opponent called 4? Actually preflop: we raised 6 (so we put 6, opponent called 4?

So they put 4 more, making total 6 each? Let's compute: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, we raise to 6 (so we put 6 total, net +5). Opponent calls 4 (makes total 6). So pot after preflop = 1+2+6+6 =15? Wait SB 1 + BB 2 + our 6 + opponent 6 =15. Then flop bet 8 from us, opponent calls 8, adding 16 to pot, total pot"

No data about postflop aggression.\n\nGiven our hand has decent equity (~26% to improve) and pot is 29, we could consider a semi-bluff raise to charge draws and build pot if we hit. Opponent checked turn; maybe they have weak hand like middle pair or nothing. Our flop bet was 8 into pot of 15? Actually pot after flop bet = 15+8+8=31? Wait earlier pot 15 preflop, flop bet 8 from us, opponent call 8 => adds 16, so pot = 15+16 =31. But the given pot is 29 chips before turn? The prompt says pot 29 chips. Might be slight mismatch due to rounding. We'll trust pot 29.\n\nIf we check, we give free river to opponent; we have chance to improve. If we raise, we could win pot now if opponent folds, or build pot if called.\n\nWhat is opponent's stack? 188 chips, we have 281. Minimum raise is 8 (to 8 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in; we have already put 6 preflop + 8 flop =14. To raise, we need to put at least 8 more? The minimum raise to is 8 (i.e., total bet of 8? Actually amount to call is 0, so raise_to = 8 means we bet 8 chips total? That seems low relative to pot. Probably raise to 8 means we bet 8 chips. So we can bet 8.\n\nGiven pot 29, a bet of 8 is about 0.28 pot, small. Might not be enough to fold out draws. But it's a turn, could be okay.\n\nWe could also check and see river. Since we have ~26% equity and pot 29, expected value of checking: if opponent checks and we get to river, we can bet or check. Might be okay.\n\nBut maybe we should raise to 12 or 14? Minimum raise is 8; we could raise more? The raise_to is total amount; we could raise to any amount above min? Usually you can raise to any amount up to stack. But we need to know allowed raise amounts. Since min raise is 8, we could raise to say 20. But we don't know if allowed. We can choose raise_to 20.\n\nGiven opponent's stack 188, they could call. A raise of 20 would be 20 into 29 pot, ~0.7 pot, decent pressure.\n\nOur hand is a draw, not a made hand; semi-bluff is appropriate. I'd raise to 20 to charge draws and possibly win now.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 20.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

But we are UTG with 9T suited, might be okay to raise to 6 or 8. However consider opponents: Kimi-K2 in seat2 (SB) may act later? Actually after we act, SB will act after us? Order: UTG (us) first, then seat6? Actually seats: 1 Kimi-K2 Thinking, 2 Kimi-K2 (SB), 3 DeepSeek (BB), 4 MiniMax folded, 5 us. So after us, seat6? Not present. So after us, SB (seat2) acts, then BB (seat3). So we are first to act preflop. Raising is standard. With 9T suited, many players raise UTG? Might be too wide. But with 155 BB, can open 3BB (6 chips). Minimum raise to 4, but we could raise more. Considering tournament and early position, maybe call to see flop cheap, but risk being out of position. I think raise to 8 (4BB) is reasonable. Need legal actions: raise to any amount >=4. Stack 310, min raise 4. We'll raise to 8. Reason: decent hand, want to thin field, build pot. Also opponent SB may call or raise. So decision: raise.\n\n"

In BB we posted 2, then raise to 8 meaning we add 6). Seat1 call 8. Seat2 raise 24 (so they re-raise to 24). Seat3 fold. So now amount to call is 16 (since we have 8 in, they raised to 24, we need to put 16 more). Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise at least to 40 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: 9dTd is a decent hand but not premium. In BB, facing a 3-bet (raise after our raise). Our raise was only to 8 (small). Opponent seat2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 24. That's a 3-bet of 24 total (i.e., 12 more after our 8). So they 3-bet fairly large relative to stack (24 is 12x big blind). They could be a strong hand. Our hand 9T is suited? No it's offsuit. So not great.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: we saw they raised to 6 previously (hand #7). That's a small raise preflop, maybe they are loose? Not enough data. Could be they 3-bet with a wide range. But 9T off is a decent blocker for broadway combos. However stack depth 151 BB, tournament early stage, we should preserve chips. 9T offsuit is not strong enough to call a 3-bet out of position (BB) vs unknown opponent. Better to fold.\n\nCheck pot odds: To call 16 to win pot of currently? Pot before call includes: blinds 1+2 =3, our raise 8 (but we already have 8 in), seat1 call 8, seat2 raise to 24 (so they added 16). So pot currently is 42 (as given). If we call 16, pot becomes 58, we would have 58 pot for 16 call = 27.6% equity needed. 9T offsuit vs unknown range maybe ~20% equity. So not profitable.\n\nThus fold.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

Wait we posted 1 as SB? Actually we are BB, posted 2. Seat 5 post_sb 1? Wait actions: Seat5 post_sb 1, Seat1 post_bb 2. So we are SB? Actually seat5 is BB? But they said Position: BB (Seat5). Yet actions show Seat5 post_sb 1 (small blind). That seems contradictory: maybe seat1 is BB? Let's parse: Usually seat numbers: seat1 is SB, seat2 is BB. But they show seat5 post_sb 1 and seat1 post_bb 2. So seat5 posted small blind 1, seat1 posted big blind 2. So our position is SB, not BB. But they said Position: BB (Seat5). Might be mislabel. But we posted small blind 1. So we are SB. Opponent seat3 raised to 6. So amount to call = 5 (they raised to 6, we have 1 already, need 5 more). Minimum raise to 10 (so raise total to 10). We have 5d6c unsuited, low connectors, not great but can be played in some situations, but early tournament with 151 BB, deep stacks, not worth a call vs raise from unknown opponent. Should we fold? Usually fold. Could call to see flop cheap? 5 BB? Actually call 5 chips, pot would be 9+5+6=20. So pot odds 5 to 20 = 25% call. Hand equity vs typical range? Opponent raised from early position? Not sure seat3 position unknown, maybe MP? But likely they have a decent range. 5-6 suited? Not suited, unsuited. So equity maybe ~15% vs typical raising range. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

Considering opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 raised preflop in previous hands sometimes (6, 24, 6). So they may be raising with a range perhaps wide? But we have 2 opponents with short stacks; we could try to steal blinds with a raise. However Qc7c is not a premium hand. In BTN, raise to 4 (minimum) is a standard steal. The big blind may call or 3-bet. But given short stacks, they might shove if they have decent hand. But we have 151 BB, can afford to call a raise of 4 and see flop.\n\nWe could also just call to see flop cheap, but raise may get folds and win blinds. Qc7c has some flush and straight potential.

So we are facing a call of 2 from seat4, which is likely the player in UTG or something. No raises yet. We are in cutoff with A2 offsuit. Stack 305 chips, deep relative to blinds (152.5 BB). In tournament early stage, but stack deep. Should we raise? A2 is weak, but Ace high may be okay to steal blinds. However there is a call from seat4, meaning someone already called the big blind, likely a loose player. Raising may isolate. Given deep stacks, we could raise to 6-8 to try to take down blinds and maybe get heads-up. But A2 is weak; risk of being dominated by better Ace (like AK, AQ, AJ) is high. However with deep stacks, we can fold and wait for better.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called the BB. Could be a caller. Might be okay to raise? Could also be a tight player that just called with a decent hand. Not sure.\n\nGiven the hand is weak, typical strategy: fold A2 offsuit in early position (CO still early-ish but not early). But cutoff is a stealing spot. With deep stacks, we could raise small to attempt steal. Many players raise with A2 offsuit as a steal attempt. But risk of being called by stronger Ace is there.\n\nGiven tournament, we have deep stack, we can afford to fold.\n\nThus likely fold.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Current board: 8h 2h 9s 2s. So board pairs 2s, two hearts (8h,2h). Our hand Qh3h: we have nut flush draw? Hearts: we have Qh and 3h, board has 8h and 2h, so we have a flush draw with 9 outs (any heart except Qh,3h,8h,2h). Also we have a gutshot? Straight possibilities: board 8-9-2-2, we have Q and 3, not relevant.\n\nWe have top pair? No pair. We have backdoor flush. Pot size 9 chips. Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) in seat 3 is the only other player. Preflop they called 2, flop they called 2 after we bet 2. So they have called our flop bet. Now turn action: we are BB, we acted first? Actually order: after flop betting, we bet 2, they called. Turn now: we are first to act (since we are BB). The actions list shows only \"Amount to call: 0\". So we can check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. There's no bet to call.\n\nWe need to decide based on opponent tendencies. We recall opponent's turn bet history: they bet 6 on turn in hand #8. That suggests they may be aggressive, perhaps they bet when they have made hand. In this hand, we have a flush draw. Should we bet? We could raise (i.e., bet). Minimum raise to 2 (so raise to 2? Actually raise_to is total amount; currently amount to call 0, so raise to 2 is a bet of 2). That's small relative to pot 9. Pot odds: if we bet 2, opponent must call 2 to win pot ~11. That's good if they call with weaker hands.\n\nBut opponent may bet on turn when they have a made hand; they might also call a bet. We don't know their range. Preflop they called 2, could have any hand. Flop board: 8h 2h 9s. They called our flop bet of 2. Could have hearts, pair, straight draw, etc.\n\nOur hand: Qh3h gives us nut flush draw (any heart gives us flush, Qh is highest heart). Also we have overcards but not pair.\n\nWe have 9 outs for flush (any heart except those known: Qh,3h,8h,2h). That's 9 outs. Also maybe a straight draw? Not really.\n\nTurn card is unknown; currently board: 8h 2h 9s 2s. Turn is unknown? Actually board shows turn is 2s? Wait board shows 8h 2h 9s 2s. So turn is 2s (a second 2). So board now is paired 2s. That gives us potential full house possibilities for opponent if they have a 2.\n\nWe have no pair, but we have flush draw.\n\nWe need to decide whether to bet or check. If we bet, we could represent a made hand (e.g., a 2 for full house) and maybe get fold equity. Opponent's previous turn bet of 6 suggests they bet when they have a made hand. So they might bet now if they have a 2, a set, two pair, etc. We could raise to maybe 4-5 to protect? But we only have 301 chips, pot small. Minimum raise to 2 is small; we could raise to 5 maybe? Not sure about max raise. No max given; but we must be within stack.\n\nWe should consider tournament stage: 301 chips, blinds 1/2, effective stack 150 BB, deep. We can afford a small raise.\n\nGiven we have a strong draw, we could bet for value and fold equity. Opponent may call with weaker pairs or draws. So I think we should raise (bet) to maybe 5 chips (total). But need to ensure it's legal: raise to any amount >= min raise (2). So raise_to 5.\n\nReasoning: we have nut flush draw, want to build pot, opponent likely has a hand like a pair or 2, but we want to protect against giving them free card (river). Also we could get them to fold if they have medium hand.\n\nThus action: raise to 5.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Board: 8,2,9,2. No straight draws. We have backdoor possibilities. Opponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) called flop bet of 2 into pot 9. Flop: we bet 2, pot becomes 9? Actually preflop pot: 1+2+2 =5? Let's compute: blinds 1/2, we are BB posted 2, SB posted 1, opponent called 2, so pot 5 preflop. Flop: we bet 2, opponent call 2, pot 9. Turn now. Opponent's stack unknown but he has 116 chips.

Pot 9, bet 2 would be small. We could raise to 6 (about 2/3 pot). Opponent may call with pair or raise? Might be okay.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. No call because amount to call is 0. So we can check or raise. Check might give free card, but turn could be a heart completing flush; we want to get value if opponent has a pair and we hit flush later. Also we could bet to charge draws. So raise.\n\nWe need to specify raise_to total amount. Minimum raise is 2, so raise to 4? Actually raise total includes the call? Since amount to call is 0, raise_to is total amount we put in. Minimum raise to is 2 (i.e., bet 2). Could raise to 6. Choose 6.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Opponents have about 89 and 97 BB. Should we raise to isolate? Both have short stacks, could be aggressive. 9-8 suited is a good hand for a raise, especially on button. Could also limp to see flop cheap, but raising can pick up blinds. Usually raise to about 3x BB = 6, but min raise is 4, we could raise to 6 or more. Legal actions only fold, call, raise. Should we raise? Yes, raise to 6 maybe. Need to consider that they could shove if we raise, but they have 178 chips, 89 BB, they'd likely call or shove all-in if raise is big. Raising to 6 is small relative to their stacks, they might call. But we want to isolate and maybe get action. 9-8 suited has good equity vs random hands. So raise.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 6.

So the raise to 12 is from seat2, meaning they raised to 12 total. Our contribution is 2 (SB) + we haven't posted BB (since we are SB). Actually we are SB, so we posted 2. The BB posted 4. So the raise to 12 is from seat2, we need to call additional 10? Let's compute: current pot includes SB 2, BB 4, raise to 12 from seat2 (so they put 12). So total contributions: SB 2, BB 4, seat2 12 = 18. Our amount to call is 12 - 2 = 10? But the prompt says amount to call: 8. So maybe they consider that we are the BB? Wait seat5 is SB, seat5 posted SB 2, seat5 also posted BB 4? That seems weird. Actually the actions: preflop: Seat 4 post_sb 2 (that's seat4, but seat4 is MiniMax-M2 folded later). Then preflop: Seat 5 post_bb 4. So seat4 posted SB 2, seat5 posted BB 4. So we are BB, not SB. The Position line says SB (Seat5) but the actions indicate seat5 is BB. There's inconsistency. Probably position is SB, seat5 posted BB incorrectly. But amount to call is 8, min raise 20. So we need to call 8 to match raise to 12 (since we have 4 in pot as BB). So we have Kd8d, a weak hand. Opponent seat2 raised to 12 from UTG? Not sure.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call, raise. K8 suited is not strong enough for a 3-bet in early position against unknown. Stack 308, we have 77 BB, deep.

Actually they raised 8 total, which is 4 over BB? Wait: blinds 2/4, SB posted 2, BB posted 4, then MiniMax-M2 (Seat4) raised 8, meaning they put 8 total (i.e., 4 raise). So amount to call is 6 (since we have 2 posted, need to put total 8, so 6 more). Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise at least to 12 total). Our hand: Ah Ts (Ace Ten suited). Stack 306 chips, 76.5 BB. We are in SB, out of position post-flop.\n\nWe need to decide fold, call, raise.\n\nConsider hand strength: Ace Ten suited is a decent hand, especially in early position? In SB, but out of position. In tournament with 76 BB, still deep. Facing a raise from MP? Actually seat4 maybe MP? Not sure. Opponent's tendencies: we saw MiniMax-M2 raised preflop 4 (small raise) in hand 19. Also raised on flop 8 in hand 9. Not much data. Could be a loose raiser.\n\nWe have 6 to call, pot is 14 (2+4+8). Effective stack after call: 306-6 = 300 left, still deep. Ace Ten suited has good equity vs random raise (~35% vs a random 2-5 range). If opponent is raising a wide range, we could call and see flop. Raising could be to isolate and get value if they are weaker. Minimum raise to 12 would be 12 total, i.e., raise additional 4 (since we need to put 12 total). That would be a 4 raise over call (so 6 to call + 4 = 10 extra). Actually raise_to is total amount we put in: currently we have posted 2, need to put 12 total, so need 10 more chips. That's a raise of 10? Wait: legal raise to 12 means total bet after raise is 12. Since we already have 2 posted, we need to put 10 more. That would be a raise of 4 over call (call 6, raise extra 4). So raise to 12 is small. Could also go all-in but not needed.\n\nGiven deep stack, raising could isolate and build pot with a strong hand. Ace Ten suited can make top pair, straight, flush. But also can be dominated by AK, AQ, etc. In SB, out of position, raising may be okay to take initiative.\n\nBut opponent's raise size is small (8 total). This could be a steal attempt from MP. If we raise, we could push them out or get heads-up. Our hand is decent but not premium. Many players would just call or fold. Considering tournament, preserving stack is okay. With 76 BB, we can afford to call.\n\nThus best action: call. Reason: decent hand, deep stack, want to see flop, out of position, small raise, opponent likely wide, we can see cheap flop.\n\nThus output JSON.",

Cards: 6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A. With T and J on board, we have 10-J, need Q or 8? Wait we have T, board J,9,6. Straight possibilities: 6-7-8-9-10 (need 8 or 7?), we have T, board 9,6, J. Actually 6-7-8-9-10: we have 10,9,6, missing 7 and 8. Not open. 7-8-9-10-J: we have T,J, need 7 and 8. Not open. 8-9-10-J-Q: we have T,J, need Q and 8. So need both 8 and Q? That's two cards, not a draw. So we have only a pair of Ace high? Actually no pair. We have Ace high with a gutshot? Wait we have A T, board J 9 6. No pair. We have backdoor flush draw? Suits: Ah (hearts), Ts (spades). Board hearts: Jd, 9h, 6c. One heart on board (9h). So we have backdoor flush draw (need two hearts). Not strong.\n\nMiniMax-M2 raised preflop to 8 (from BB). We called. So they likely have a range of strong hands, maybe broadway, pairs, suited connectors. On flop J 9 6, they bet? Actually it's our turn. The actions list shows only preflop actions; now it's flop with amount to call 0. So it's our turn after they raised preflop and we called, then flop action order: first to act is the raiser (MiniMax-M2) because they are in position? Actually seat 4 is MP? Seat 5 is BB (us). The flop action order: first to act is seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) because they were the preflop aggressor. But the actions list doesn't show flop actions yet. So now it's our turn with amount to call 0 (meaning MiniMax-M2 checked? Actually the pot is 20 chips (preflop: 4+8+2? Wait preflop: SB 2, BB 4, raise to 8 (so 8 total?), call 6, so pot = 2+4+8+6 = 20). So after flop, no bet yet. So it's our action first? Actually if MiniMax-M2 acted first and they checked, then amount to call is 0 for us. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need decide: check or raise. Hand is weak. Likely check. Could consider a small raise as bluff? But opponent may call with wide range. Our stack 300, pot 20, raise min 4 to 24 total? Actually raise to total amount: minimum raise to 4 chips more than call? Since call is 0, minimum raise to 4? The legal raise amount is total 4? Usually raise must be at least double the previous bet, but here no bet, so min bet is big blind amount? It says Minimum raise to: 4. So we could bet 4 chips.\n\nShould we bet as a continuation? Our hand has no equity, but we could try to steal pot. Opponent raised preflop, so likely has strong hand, not likely to fold to 4 chips. Might be okay to check and see turn.\n\nThus check.\n\nReasoning: weak hand, no showdown value, opponent likely strong, preserve chips.\n\nReturn JSON.",

So basically we have nothing, just Ace high. So likely we should fold to bet.\n\nBut consider opponent's betting pattern: He bet small 4 on flop.

Could be a c-bet with any hand, but also could be a draw.\n\nOur hand Ah Ts is not strong, but Ace high is decent vs unknown. However, we are out of position (BB). After calling, we will be out of position on turn and river. Might be okay to fold.\n\nWe can also consider raising to protect? Not advisable with weak hand.\n\nThus fold is likely best.\n\nCheck opponent's tendencies: Past actions: He bet 4 on flop previously (hand 16). Also raised 8 on flop (hand 9).

Minimum raise to: 120. So the opponent raised to 72 (i.e., he put 72 total into pot?), meaning the bet is now 72? Actually we have to call 72 to match his raise.

Likely a strong hand: maybe a set (6), two pair, maybe a straight draw, maybe a flush draw? Board: 6s 6d 9d Qs. Two spades on board, we have Js, so we have a gutshot? Actually we have a flush draw? Board has two spades (6s, Qs). We have Js (spade). That's three spades, need two more for flush. Not there. So opponent could have a spade flush draw like As, Ks, etc. Or a set of 6s? Actually set of 6s would be 6x. Could have 6c or 6h. That's a set. Could have Q9 for two pair? Or Q9 is two pair (Q and 9). Could have Q9? Actually board has Q and 9. So Q9 would be two pair (Q's and 9's). Could have Q9 combos. Could have a straight: 7-8-10? Not. Could have a straight draw like 7-8. Could have a pair of Qs? Actually board has Qs, so a Q would be top pair. Could have JQ? Actually JQ would give two pair (QJ). But board Qs, we have J, so JQ would be two pair (QJ). Could have Q9? Already considered.

Actually if we call 72, his stack would be 111-4-8-24-72 = 3 chips left? Let's compute: He posted BB 4, called 8 preflop (so 12 total), bet 24 turn (so 36 total), raise to 72 (so adds 48 more? Actually raise to 72 means total contribution 72, so additional 36? Wait he already contributed 24, so to raise to "

So Q9 would be two pair (Q's and 9's). Could have Q9 combos. Could have a straight: 7-8-10? Not. Could have a straight draw like 7-8. Could have a pair of Qs? Actually board has Qs, so a Q would be top pair. Could have JQ? Actually JQ would give two pair (QJ). But board Qs, we have J, so JQ would be two pair (QJ). Could have Q9? Already considered. Could have 9-9? No.\n\nSeat1 bet small 24 (maybe a weak hand, maybe a draw). Seat2 re-raises, indicating strength.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely we should fold. But we need to consider stack sizes and tournament context. Our stack 288, opponents have 258 and 111. Seat2's stack is 111, he raised to 72, leaving him about 39 chips after call? Actually if we call 72, his stack would be 111-4-8-24-72 = 3 chips left? Let's compute: He posted BB 4, called 8 preflop (so 12 total), bet 24 turn (so 36 total), raise to 72 (so adds 48 more? Actually raise to 72 means total contribution 72, so additional 36? Wait he already contributed 24, so to raise to ",

Both seem to raise occasionally, maybe they are aggressive. Our hand 9s4s is weak, suited but low. On button we could attempt a steal, but both opponents have stacks: SB 258, BB 151. SB is shortish but still decent. BB is shorter (151). Our stack is 282 (70 BB). Raising might be okay to steal blinds, but 9-4 suited is not great for post-flop play if called. Considering opponent tendencies: both have raised preflop sometimes, maybe they are not tight. However they are in blind positions; they may defend. The SB has raised 4 (minimum) once, but more often 12. The BB has raised 6 (min) and 12 and 24. So they may be raising with a range including weak hands. But we are on button with a weak hand; a standard play is to raise to steal, but risk being called by a defender with better hand. Since we have 70 BB, we can risk a small raise to try to take blinds. Minimum raise is 8 (total). Could raise to 12 or 15. But we should consider stack sizes: BB 151, if we raise to 12, BB might call with any decent hand. However if we raise to 12, pot will be 6+4+12? Actually call amount is 4, raise to 8 min, but raise total of 8 means we add 4 more (since call 4). Usually raise to 8 total (i.e., 8 chips in our stack). That is small. Could raise to 12 (total). Let's consider pot odds: If called, we are out of position post-flop. Our hand's equity is low. Better to fold.\n\nThus likely fold.\n\nWe'll output fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have BTN with 6d Qd (suited queen six). Stack 288, blinds 2/4. SB posted 2, BB posted 4. No other players left (others folded). So we face a BB of 4, and SB already posted 2 (but SB is seat1? Actually seat1 posted SB 2, seat2 BB 4). So we are to act after BB? In typical order, SB acts first preflop, then BB, then BTN. Here SB posted 2 (no action yet?), but the actions list only shows SB post_sb 2, BB post_bb 4, seat4 fold. So no raises yet. So we are to act on BTN, amount to call 4 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise total to 8). Hand is Q6 suited. This is a weak hand. In BTN, we could raise to steal, but Q6 suited is not a strong stealing hand; but still many players fold to raises from BTN. However opponents are Kimi-K2 (seat1 SB) and seat2 BB. Both have short stacks (258 and 147). They may be willing to call with many hands. Our stack is 72 BB, deep. We could consider raising to isolate BB? But Q6 suited is not great for 3-betting. Better to just call and see flop? But calling 4 into a pot of 6 (plus SB 2) gives us pot odds? After calling, pot will be 10 (2+4+4). Actually we call 4, pot becomes 2+4+4 =10. Our chance to improve? Q6 suited has some equity vs random range. But we are out of position after flop (SB first, then BB). Might be better to fold.\n\nGiven typical strategy: Q6s is a marginal hand. In BTN, you could raise to steal if opponents are tight. But we have info: Kimi-K2's raise amounts: they raised 6, 24, 6, 12 etc. They seem to raise moderate amounts preflop, perhaps indicating they open-raise from SB or BB? Actually they are SB (seat1) and BB (seat2). The raises recorded are from seat2 (BB) maybe. Not sure. But they raise often, maybe they are aggressive. So raising may get a re-raise or call.\n\nThus folding seems prudent.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nI'll fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have AKc in BB, small blind posted 2, big blind posted 4. Opponent in seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) posted BB 4? Wait seat1 is SB? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 posted SB 2, seat5 posted BB 4. So opponent is SB? Actually seat1 is SB (post_sb 2). So seat1 is SB with 266 chips, they posted 2. They haven't acted yet? The actions list shows seat5 post_sb 2 (that's us? Wait seat5 is BB, but they posted sb? Might be mis labeling). Actually seat5 is BB but they posted sb 2? Might be a mistake. Anyway we have amount to call 2 (the SB). So opponent in SB likely raised? No they haven't acted; amount to call 2 suggests we need to call the SB's 2 (they posted). So it's our turn after SB posted? Actually order: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, then action proceeds to UTG etc but only two players left: SB and BB. SB already posted, BB posted, now SB acts first preflop. But action list shows only posts, no raises. So SB hasn't acted yet, it's now SB's turn? But amount to call is 2, meaning SB must act, but we are BB. Wait we are BB, we act after SB. So SB's action would be either call (check) or raise. Since amount to call is 2, that is the amount we would need to call if SB raised to 6? Actually the minimum raise is 8 (total). So amount to call is 2 meaning the SB has not raised, they just posted blind. So it's our turn to act, we can check (i.e., just call 0) because we are BB and can check the blind? In NLHE, after blinds, the action starts with player left of BB (SB). Since SB posted blind, they act first; they can check (i.e., just call the blind) or raise. But the action list doesn't show SB's action, so maybe it's our turn because SB checked? Actually if SB checks, the action goes to BB who can check (i.e., just see flop) or raise. The amount to call is 2 (the SB's blind) meaning we need to call 2 to match SB's blind if we want to see flop. So we have the option to call 2, raise to at least 8, or fold (but folding loses 4). So we have AKc, strong hand. We should raise. Consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking raises preflop to 12 often (based on recall). So they are aggressive. But they haven't acted yet; they posted SB 2, could raise. If they raise, they'd likely raise to 12 (3x BB). So we can re-raise (3-bet) to maybe 30? Our stack is 288, we can do a decent 3-bet. Since they are aggressive, we want to isolate. A typical 3-bet size from BB vs SB is 3-4x the raise. If they raise to 12, 3-bet to ~30-36. Minimum raise is 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total). We could raise to 12 to just call? Actually raise to 12 would be a call? No raise to 12 means total bet 12, which is a 3-bet if they raised to 12. But they haven't raised yet. So we are raising to 12 (i.e., 3-bet) as a standard open raise from BB? Usually BB open raise size is 2.5-3x BB (i.e., 10-12). So raise to 12 is fine.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 12. Reasoning: strong AK, isolate aggressive SB, build pot.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Both have relatively short stacks, especially BB with 109 chips (~13.6 BB). Our hand K5 offsuit. In BTN, typical play: raise or call? With K5 offsuit, it's marginal. Considering opponent stacks short, we could raise to isolate and maybe steal blinds. SB is 256 chips (~32 BB) also shortish. BB is 109 chips (~13.6 BB) maybe likely to call or go all-in? But our raise size minimum 16 (total). Usually raise to 2.5-3x BB = 20-24. Since we have 36 BB stack, can raise. But K5 off is not strong for 3-bet; but we can open raise standard. However we might consider that both opponents are short, and we want to avoid being called by BB who could go all-in. If we raise to 20, BB might call (8) and see flop with K5, not great. Might be better to just call 8 and see flop cheap? But calling from BTN is unusual; we are out of position after flop (SB and BB act first). So better to raise to try to win blinds. Given K5 suited? It's hearts, so 5h Kh, suited? Yes hearts, so K5 suited. Slightly better. So raise to 20 (total) maybe. Minimum raise is 16, but we can raise more. Choose raise to 20. Reasoning: attempt steal, hand decent suited king, short stacks, want to apply pressure.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise allowed. So output raise.\n\n",

Actually actions: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, MiniMax-M2 called 8. So pot is 4+8+8=20. It's our turn, amount to call 4 (to match BB's 8? Actually we are SB, we posted 4, BB posted 8, other player called 8, so to call we need to put in 4 more to match 8). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total bet 16). Opponents: seat 1 Kimi-K2 is BB with 357 chips, seat 4 MiniMax-M2 is calling 8 (so they have 313). We have 296.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength: 8s7s suited is a decent suited connector, especially in SB vs two opponents (BB and a caller). But it's a marginal hand, could be good for limping or raising. In tournaments, with 37 BB, we can be aggressive. However, we are out of position postflop (SB will be first to act after flop). The opponent in BB is Kimi-K2, who has shown occasional raises preflop (see raise amounts 12, 24, 232). So they can be aggressive. MiniMax-M2 has been calling often, occasional betting.\n\nGiven we are in SB with 8s7s, we could consider raising to isolate the BB or take down pot. With 2 opponents, raising can thin field. But we have a marginal hand; raising may get called by both, leading to out-of-position play.\n\nOption: Call (just add 4) and see flop. Pot would be 24. 8s7s suited can flop well (open-ended straight draw, flush draws). Stack depth moderate.\n\nCheck if we have any reason to fold: 8s7s is not a fold in SB with 37BB and only two opponents. So likely call.\n\nRaise? Minimum raise to 16, that's 8 more than call. Raising to 16 total would be 12 extra (since we already have 4 posted). That would be a 2x BB raise (BB 8). Could isolate. But if BB is aggressive, they might 3-bet. MiniMax-M2 may call.\n\nGiven our hand is suited connector, we prefer to see flop cheaply. So call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually small blind 4, so raise to 12 means raise 8 more? That's a 3x BB raise). In hand 42 they raised to 24 (3x BB) and also a huge raise 232 (maybe all-in). So they can be aggressive, but also sometimes go all-in.\n\nSeat 4 (BB) hasn't acted yet preflop (they posted blind). No data.\n\nOur hand KQ suited is a strong hand, especially in position. Stack 36.5 BB, deep enough for standard raise.\n\nStandard play: raise to about 2.5-3x BB, maybe 20-24 chips. Considering we are BTN, can open raise to 24 (3x BB). That is above minimum raise 16, okay.\n\nPotentially consider 3-bet if we think seat 1 might raise later? Actually seat 1 already posted SB; they haven't acted yet. The action order: SB, BB, then BTN (us). So we are first to act after blinds. So we can raise.\n\nGiven KQ suited is top 10% hand, raise.\n\nStack depth: 292 chips, 36 BB, raising to 24 leaves 268, okay.\n\nThus decision: raise to 24 (or maybe 22).

Actually order after flop: SB first (seat5), then seat1 (BB), then seat4 (MP?). Actually seat4 is after seat1? The order is SB, BB, then UTG? But seat4 is MP maybe after BB. But currently only SB and BB and seat4 are still in. The flop is 8s 2h Kc. Our hand Ah 9c: we have Ace high, 9 kicker. No pair, no draw (straight draw? 8-9-10-J-Q? Not possible). No flush draw (two spades? we have Ah (heart) and 9c (club). Board has spade 8, heart 2, club K. So we have backdoor possibilities but weak.\n\nWe need to decide check or raise. Opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 has raised on flop before (hand 28 raised 40). That suggests they can be aggressive, maybe continuation bet. Kimi-K2 is BB, hasn't acted yet. Their raise pattern preflop is small raises (12) and occasional big (105). Not much flop data.\n\nGiven our weak hand, likely check. But consider possibility of a bluff raise? Our stack 300, pot 24. Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total? Actually raise to total amount; current bet is 0, so raise to 8 means bet 8). That's a small raise. Could be a steal attempt, but we are SB with weak hand. Opponents may call with any pair or better. Might be risky.\n\nBetter to check and see what BB does. If BB bets, we can consider folding.\n\nThus decision: check.\n\nWe need JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Board: 8s 2h Kc 5d. Our hand Ah 9c. So we have Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Actually need 7 for straight (8-7-6-5-4? no). Board: 8,2,K,5. We have A,9. No pair. Potential draws: 9 gives gutshot to 10-J? Not. 9 could make a pair if a 9 hits later. No flush draw (two spades? we have Ah,9c; board has spade 8, others none). So essentially just Ace high.\n\nOpponent seats: Seat 1 Kimi-K2 with 377 chips, seat 4 MiniMax-M2 with 285 chips. Both still in. Preflop: Seat 5 (us) posted SB 4, seat 1 posted BB 8, seat4 called 8, seat5 called 4 (so we just called SB). Then seat1 checked, flop check all around. So pot 24 chips after flop (4+8+8+4? Actually pot: SB 4, BB 8, call 8 from seat4, call 4 from us = 24). No bets so far.\n\nNow turn: board adds 5d. No bets yet. It's our turn? Actually order: seat5 is SB, seat1 BB, seat4 UTG? Not sure but actions: we are seat5 (SB). After flop checks, it's turn, and actions order: seat5 first (SB), then seat1, then seat4? Usually order is from SB clockwise. So we act first.\n\nWe have Ace high, not strong. Opponents have larger stacks (377, 285). We have 300. Likely they have stronger hands (maybe pair, two pair, etc). Should we check and see what they do? If we check and they bet, we may have to fold. Could we raise as a bluff? Our stack 300, pot 24, raise to at least 8 (minimum). Could try a small raise to take pot. But with Ace high, risk.\n\nConsider tournament stage: we have 37.5 BB, decent stack. Should preserve chips. Likely best to check and fold to any bet.\n\nCheck legal. So action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

On button, could steal but opponent may defend. Stack sizes: we have 300, opponent 277. Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). That's 8 to call + 8 extra? Actually raise to 16 means total put in 16, so raise amount = 8 (since call is 8). So raise to 16 is a small raise.\n\nWe should consider opponent tendencies: recall shows MiniMax-M2 raised preflop twice: hand 19 raise amount 4 (that's weird, maybe a min raise? maybe they were in SB? Actually seat4 is BB, raise of 4? Could be a re-raise? Not sure). Hand24 raise amount 8 (maybe a standard raise). Not enough data. Likely they raise with a wide range from BB? Could be they defend loosely.\n\nGiven J8 off, typical strategy: fold unless you think you can steal with a small raise and opponent folds. But opponent's stack is similar, they may call. Risk of losing 8 chips for a weak hand is okay? 8 is 2.7% of stack. Could call and see flop cheap. But J8 off is low equity vs typical BB defending range. Better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

Raising might isolate and get heads-up. Opponent's tendency: from recall, they have raised sometimes preflop (12, 12, 12, 24, 232). But this time they just called. Might be playing tight? Not sure. In tournament early-ish with 36 BB, we want to preserve stack. 5T is not a hand to risk a big raise. Checking is fine, we can see flop cheap. If we raise, min raise is 16 (total). That would be raise to 16 total, meaning we put 8 more (since we already have 8). That's a 2BB raise.

No pair, no straight draw (we have gutshot? board: J J 4 3, we have T,5. Straight possibilities: 6-7-8-9-10? Not. So we have just high card Ten, which is lower than Jacks. Opponent (seat1) Kimi-K2 Thinking has called preflop, checked flop, and now it's turn with amount to call 0 (they haven't bet). So we have option to check or raise. Pot is 20 chips. Stack 292. Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in. Since amount to call 0, raising to 8 means you bet 8). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since we are not facing a bet, folding would be weird (you can fold only if you want to give up hand). Check is safe. Raise could be a bluff or value. Our hand is weak; opponent likely has something better (maybe a jack, or a pair). Opponent's tendencies: from recall, they have raised preflop many times, also raised flop 24 chips (hand #9). That flop raise suggests they can be aggressive. But currently they checked flop. Could be they missed flop, or have a weak hand. Our hand is weak; we could try a small bluff to take pot. But risk: opponent may have Jacks or a set (maybe J J 4 gave them a pair of Jacks, they could have Jx). They might call or raise. With only 20 pot, raising to 8 is 40% pot. Could be okay as a bluff. However tournament considerations: we have 36.5 BB, not huge but decent. Preserving chips is important. A small bluff may be okay, but if opponent has a strong hand they could re-raise and we would be forced to fold and lose 8. That's okay. But maybe better to check and see river. River card unknown. Could be a straight or flush draw? Board: Jh Jc 4s 3s. No spade flush draw (two spades on board, we have no spade). So no flush draw. Straight draws: open-ended? 5-6-7-8-9? No. So not many draws.\n\nThus checking is safe. Considering opponent's previous pattern: they raised flop big when they had something. But they checked now, maybe they have medium hand like Jx or a pair of 4s, 3s. Could be they are checking to induce a bet. Our bet could be seen as a bluff; they may call with Jacks or a set, but they might also fold weaker. But we have no showdown value.\n\nGiven risk vs reward: pot 20, we can win 20 by betting 8 and being called maybe. If they fold, we win 20 for 8 risk. That's good EV if fold > 50% of time. Not sure.\n\nGiven limited info, I'd opt to check and see river. So action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have a river situation: board J h J c 4 s 3 s 2 s. So board is paired Jacks, and three spades 4s 3s 2s - a possible straight flush draw but missed. Our hand: 5h Td. So we have Ten of diamonds, Five of hearts. No pair, no straight, no flush. Board has two Jacks, so opponent could have a Jack, making a set, or a full house (Jacks full of something). Also could have a straight? Board: J J 4 3 2. Straight possible with A K Q? No. With 5? 5-4-3-2-A? No Ace. So only possible hands: any pair of Jacks (set), any two pair (Jacks plus something else), maybe a straight using 5-4-3-2-A? Not possible. Flush? Board has three spades, need two spades in hand, we have none. So opponent could have a flush if they have two spades, but board spades are 4s,3s,2s; need at least two spades for flush, but there are only three spades on board, need two more for flush, but opponent only has two cards, could be both spades, giving a flush (5 spades). That would be a flush higher than any pair. Could also have a full house: Jacks full of something (if they have a Jack plus another card that pairs board? Actually board has J J, no other pair. To have full house, they'd need a pair on board plus a Jack, but board has no pair besides Jacks. So full house could be Jacks full of something if they have a Jack and a card that pairs with board? No board pair besides Jacks. So full house could be Jacks over something if they have a Jack and the board pairs something else? Not possible. So full house could be something like 4-4? Board has a single 4, not a pair. So full house not possible unless opponent has a pair in hand and board has a pair (Jacks). They could have a pocket pair, e.g., 5-5, making full house (Jacks full of 5s) if board has J J and they have a pair, that's three of a kind Jacks on board plus pair in hand => full house Jacks over X. Actually board has two Jacks, you need a third Jack to make three of a kind, then pair from hand gives full house. But opponent could have a Jack and a card matching board? If they have Jx, they'd have trips Jacks (three of a kind) not full house. Full house requires three of a kind + a pair. So they could have a pocket pair of something else, e.g., 4-4, making full house (4s over Jacks) but board only has one 4. So they'd need two 4s in hand plus two Jacks on board = full house 4s over Jacks? Actually board: J J 4 3 2. If opponent has 4-4, they'd have three 4s (two in hand + one on board) and a pair of Jacks on board -> full house 4s over Jacks. That's possible. Similarly 3-3 gives full house 3s over Jacks, etc. So many full house possibilities.\n\nOur hand is worthless. We have no showdown value. So we should fold. The amount to call is 0, but we can check. The legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since we have no chance to win, we should check (or fold). Checking is fine, we don't lose more chips. So action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have 4d5c on button, small stack 300 chips (37.5 BB). Blinds 4/8. Preflop action: SB posted 4 (Seat1). BB posted 8 (Seat4). We called 8 (so we just called the BB). Then SB folded. BB (MiniMax-M2) raised to 16 (so raise to 16 total? Actually they raised to 16, meaning they put total 16 chips? Usually raise to 16 means they put 16 total (i.e., 8 raise). So amount to call is 8 (the difference). Minimum raise to 24 (i.e., raise to at least 24 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have 4-5 unsuited. Not a premium hand. In button vs BB raise after we called, we are out of position? Actually after BB raises, we are still on button, but action goes to us. We are facing a raise from BB after we called his blind. So we are first to act after BB's raise. Our hand is weak. In tournament with 37.5 BB, we can fold. But also could consider calling to see flop with speculative hand in position (we will be out of position after flop because BB is in the big blind, but we will be first to act preflop after them, then flop we will be first to act (since we are button and they are BB). Actually button acts last preflop, but after BB raise we are first to act? No, order: SB, BB, then button, then UTG etc. Since we are button, we act after BB. So we will act now. If we call, we will be in the pot with 8 extra (total 16). Our stack after call will be 284. The raise size is 16 total, which is 2 BB (since BB is 8). So it's a 2x raise. That's a small raise. With 4-5 offsuit, maybe a call is okay to see flop, but it's a low suited connector? Actually 4d5c unsuited, low connector, can make straights, but not great.\n\nConsider opponent's tendencies: MiniMax-M2's recent actions: they called preflop with 8 in hand #50, then called flop big bet 48 (so they were willing to call large flop bet). In hand 47 they called turn 12 after earlier action. They also folded preflop often. They seem to call with unknown range. Not extremely tight. Could be calling light. So raising to 16 is a small raise, maybe they are trying to steal? Or they could be defending.\n\nGiven we have 37.5 BB, we can afford to fold and preserve stack. 4-5 is not strong enough to call a raise from BB in early tournament? However, button is best position. But we will be out of position post-flop. Still can see flop cheap.\n\nPot odds: current pot 28 (including blinds and our call?). Actually pot before action: SB 4, BB 8, we called 8, SB folded, BB raised to 16, pot currently is 4 (SB) + 8 (BB) + 8 (our call) = 20? Wait: after SB posted 4, BB posted 8, we called 8, SB folded, BB raised to 16 (adds 8 more). So pot now is 4 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 28? Actually the raise adds 8, making BB's total contribution 16. So total pot = SB 4 + BB 16 + our call 8 = 28. Yes.\n\nWe need to call 8 to continue, making pot 36. So pot odds = 8/(8+28) = 8/36 = 22.2% needed to break even. Our hand equity vs unknown range? 4-5 offsuit vs typical BB raising range maybe 15%? Our equity maybe around 12-15% maybe less. So not profitable.\n\nThus folding is likely correct.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\n",

Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise total to 16). Raising would be to 16 total (i.e., raise 8 more). That would be 8 raise over call? Actually we have to put total 16 chips (including our 4 already posted). So raise amount = 12 more? Wait we have posted 4, call amount 4 to reach 8, raising to 16 means we need to add 12 more chips (4 already + 4 call + 12 raise = 20 total?). Actually typical: amount to call = 4, minimum raise to = 16 (total). So raise would be adding 12 more chips (so total contribution becomes 16). That would be a decent raise size (2.5x BB). Might isolate.\n\nGiven we have 36 BB, we could raise to try to steal blinds. Qh7h is not premium but could be okay for a steal. However we have a caller already (seat4) who called BB, so raising may get re-raised.

          "content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: SB with Qh7h, board 9h 3s 6h. So we have a flush draw (hearts) with queen high, plus open-ended straight draw? Actually cards: 9-6-3, we have 7, so we have 7-8-9? No 8 missing. Straight draw: we have 7, board has 6,9, so need 8 for gutshot? 7-8-9 straight, need 8. So we have a gutshot straight draw plus flush draw. Also we have a pair? No. So decent draw.\n\nPot is 24 chips. Stack 284. Opponent MiniMax-M2 has 225 chips. Preflop actions: seat4 called 8 (so in the pot). So flop action: after preflop, seat5 (us) is SB, seat1 (Kimi) is BB? Actually seat1 is BB, seat5 is SB. The flop action order: Usually after flop, first to act is UTG etc but with only two players left: seat4 (MiniMax) is in the big blind? Actually seat4 is MP maybe? Wait seat4 is MiniMax-M2, seat5 is us, seat1 is BB. The flop order: The player left of the dealer (SB) acts first? In Texas Hold'em, flop action starts with the first active player left of the dealer button. The button is seat5? Actually we are SB seat5, button is seat? Not given. But preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, seat4 called 8 (so they are under the gun? Actually seat4 is MP maybe). Then seat5 call 4 (SB). Then seat1 (BB) check. So after preflop, seat4 (MiniMax) is the only other player besides us and BB. The BB checked, so flop action: first to act is seat4 (MiniMax) because they are left of button? Actually after preflop, the first to act on flop is the player left of the button (i.e., SB). But the SB (us) is seat5, but we are after seat4? Hmm typical: Button is seat5? No, SB is seat5, BB is seat1, seat4 is UTG? The button is seat? Not given. In a 5-player game, button rotates; currently seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB, so button is seat4? Possibly. So flop action order: first to act is seat5 (SB) because it's left of button? Actually the button is seat4, so first to act is seat5 (SB). So we have the option to act now. The legal actions: fold, check, raise. So opponent hasn't acted yet on flop. So we can check or raise.\n\nOur hand: strong draw, pot 24, opponent stack 225, we have 284. We could bet to build pot and possibly take down now, but also risk being raised. Considering opponent tendencies: recall shows MiniMax-M2 has flopped bets of 4,4,6,4,20,8. So they sometimes bet small, sometimes big (20). They may be aggressive. In this hand, they haven't acted yet; we can check and see what they do. With a draw, checking can induce a bet from them, giving us odds. However, we have position? Actually we are first to act, so checking gives them opportunity to bet. If they bet, we can call (or raise). Since we have a decent draw, calling a moderate bet is okay.\n\nPot 24, we have 284, we can afford a raise. Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total? Actually raise_to is total amount, minimum raise is 8 which would be raise to 8? Since amount to call is 0, raising to 8 would be a bet of 8). That's a small bet relative to pot (8 into 24). Might be okay to put pressure. If they have a hand they might call or raise. Could also raise bigger to protect.\n\nGiven opponent's range includes draws and made hands. A bet of 8 could be good to get value from top pair or to charge draws. But we also risk being raised by a stronger hand, but we can fold then.\n\nI think best is to bet (raise) to 8 (i.e., bet 8). Reason: we have strong draws, want to build pot, and we can get value if they have a pair. Also we can protect against free cards.\n\nThus action: raise to 8.\n\n"

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: SB with Qh7h, board 9h 3s 6h. So we have a flush draw (hearts) with queen high, plus open-ended straight draw? Actually cards: 9-6-3, we have 7, so we have 7-8-9? No 8 missing. Straight draw: we have 7, board has 6,9, so need 8 for gutshot? 7-8-9 straight, need 8. So we have a gutshot straight draw plus flush draw. Also we have a pair? No. So decent draw.\n\nPot is 24 chips. Stack 284. Opponent MiniMax-M2 has 225 chips. Preflop actions: seat4 called 8 (so in the pot). So flop action: after preflop, seat5 (us) is SB, seat1 (Kimi) is BB? Actually seat1 is BB, seat5 is SB. The flop action order: Usually after flop, first to act is UTG etc but with only two players left: seat4 (MiniMax) is in the big blind? Actually seat4 is MP maybe? Wait seat4 is MiniMax-M2, seat5 is us, seat1 is BB. The flop order: The player left of the dealer (SB) acts first? In Texas Hold'em, flop action starts with the first active player left of the dealer button. The button is seat5? Actually we are SB seat5, button is seat? Not given. But preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, seat4 called 8 (so they are under the gun? Actually seat4 is MP maybe). Then seat5 call 4 (SB). Then seat1 (BB) check. So after preflop, seat4 (MiniMax) is the only other player besides us and BB. The BB checked, so flop action: first to act is seat4 (MiniMax) because they are left of button? Actually after preflop, the first to act on flop is the player left of the button (i.e., SB). But the SB (us) is seat5, but we are after seat4? Hmm typical: Button is seat5? No, SB is seat5, BB is seat1, seat4 is UTG? The button is seat? Not given. In a 5-player game, button rotates; currently seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB, so button is seat4? Possibly. So flop action order: first to act is seat5 (SB) because it's left of button? Actually the button is seat4, so first to act is seat5 (SB). So we have the option to act now. The legal actions: fold, check, raise. So opponent hasn't acted yet on flop. So we can check or raise.\n\nOur hand: strong draw, pot 24, opponent stack 225, we have 284. We could bet to build pot and possibly take down now, but also risk being raised. Considering opponent tendencies: recall shows MiniMax-M2 has flopped bets of 4,4,6,4,20,8. So they sometimes bet small, sometimes big (20). They may be aggressive. In this hand, they haven't acted yet; we can check and see what they do. With a draw, checking can induce a bet from them, giving us odds. However, we have position? Actually we are first to act, so checking gives them opportunity to bet. If they bet, we can call (or raise). Since we have a decent draw, calling a moderate bet is okay.\n\nPot 24, we have 284, we can afford a raise. Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total? Actually raise_to is total amount, minimum raise is 8 which would be raise to 8? Since amount to call is 0, raising to 8 would be a bet of 8). That's a small bet relative to pot (8 into 24). Might be okay to put pressure. If they have a hand they might call or raise. Could also raise bigger to protect.\n\nGiven opponent's range includes draws and made hands. A bet of 8 could be good to get value from top pair or to charge draws. But we also risk being raised by a stronger hand, but we can fold then.\n\nI think best is to bet (raise) to 8 (i.e., bet 8). Reason: we have strong draws, want to build pot, and we can get value if they have a pair. Also we can protect against free cards.\n\nThus action: raise to 8.\n\n",

Pot odds: call 8 to win pot 12+8 =20? Actually pot is 12 (SB+BB). Call 8 adds 8, total pot 20. So pot odds 8/20 = 40% needed. Hand equity vs two random hands? 2J offsuit vs two random?

So we are to act facing 8 to call (BB). Legal actions: fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to 16 (so raise total to 16). Need to decide.\n\nConsider hand strength: A3 offsuit is weak. In BTN, but still not great. Could be used for stealing blinds, but opponent in BB is MiniMax-M2 with 209 chips (about 26 BB). He may defend. Need to consider opponent tendencies: recall shows he raised preflop three times: amounts 4,8,16 (these are raises from earlier hands). Not sure context. Might indicate he's aggressive raising from BB? Actually those are his actions when he was in some seat (maybe early position). Not enough.\n\nWe can also recall opponent's fold to raises? But limited.\n\nGiven stack sizes, we have 39 BB, can afford a raise. But A3o is not a good raise for value; maybe a steal attempt is okay, but BB may defend with wide range. Since we have decent stack, but not huge, maybe we should just call and see flop? But calling with A3o out of position (BTN vs BB) after SB? Actually we are BTN, after SB and BB posted, we act first preflop. If we call, we will be out of position postflop vs BB (since BB is last to act preflop, then flop action starts with SB, then BB, then us). So we would be out of position. That's disadvantage.\n\nBetter to raise to try to steal, but risk being 3-bet? Actually only one raise possible preflop (we can raise). If we raise to 16 (total), that's 8 more chips beyond call. That is a 2x raise (standard). If BB folds, we win 12 pot + 4 SB = 12? Actually pot is 12 (SB+BB+our call). If we raise, pot will be bigger.\n\nGiven opponent's range, maybe they defend with many hands. A3o is not strong enough to continue if they call. So raising is risky. Could fold.\n\nWhat about calling? If we call, we will be out of position, but we have Ace high which may win if flop has Ace. But also could be dominated by better Ace.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, we have decent stack, but we want to preserve chips. A3o is not worth risking. I think fold is appropriate.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

Actually seat1 posted SB 8, seat4 posted BB 16. So we are facing a 16 call to see flop. Minimum raise is 32 (i.e., raise to 32 total). We have Qc Kh (broadway suited? Actually Qc and Kh are not same suit, unsuited). Hand strength: decent, about 12% preflop, good for button. Need to consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (SB) has raised preflop 4 times small raise of 12 (likely 3bb?), and one large raise 105 (maybe all-in). So SB seems aggressive, but small raise maybe a steal attempt. MiniMax-M2 (BB) hasn't acted yet preflop (just posted BB). We have no data for BB. But typical play: we can raise to isolate SB or BB. With QK offsuit on button, a standard raise to 3x BB (48) is typical. But stack is 18.5 BB, so raising to 32 is 2x BB (minimum). Could raise to 48 (3x) but need to ensure legal: minimum raise is 32, but we can raise higher up to our stack. Should we raise? Considering we have decent hand, we want to take initiative, isolate. Opponent SB appears to raise small often, but we are not facing a raise, just a call. Actually there is no raise yet, we can either call (i.e., just limp) or raise. LIMP with QK is not ideal. So raise. How much? Maybe to 48 (3x) to build pot and discourage multiple callers. But also consider stack size: 296 chips, raising to 48 leaves 248 behind, still decent. Opponents' stacks: SB 477, BB 189. Raising to 48 may be okay.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: we have 18.5 BB, relatively short stack but not ultra short. Raising is good.\n\nThus action: raise to 48 (or maybe 40). Minimum raise is 32, but raising to 48 is okay. Choose raise_to 48.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So pot 104 after flop (preflop pot: 8+16+48+32 = 104). Wait preflop pot: SB 8 (folded), BB 16, we raised to 48 (so we added 32 more?), Actually raise to 48 means we put 48 total, which is 32 more than BB's 16. Then BB called 32 to match 48, so pot = 8+16+48+48 = 120? But given pot 104, maybe SB posted 8 and folded, BB 16, we raised to 48 (so we added 32), BB called 32, total contributions: SB 8, BB 16+32=48, us 48, total 104. Yes that matches: SB 8 (but folded, still in pot). So pot 104.\n\nNow flop: BB checked. We have 248 stack, pot 104, we are out of position (but we are BTN, after flop we act first?

No bet action, only raise (since it's a bet/raise). Minimum raise to 32, meaning we can raise to 32 total? Actually raise to 32 means total bet of 32? Since amount to call is 0, raise to 32 would be a bet of 32. So we can bet 32 minimum. Pot is 104, bet 32 is about 0.3 pot. Could also raise larger.\n\nConsider opponent's tendencies: He checks flop often (history shows many checks). Could be passive. He may have weak hand or drawing. Our overcards are decent. With 15.5 BB stack, we can afford to bet. Goal: steal pot or see turn cheap. Since we have two overcards, we could bet to protect against draws and extract value from weaker hands like Jx, 5x, 4x, maybe a pocket pair like TT?

We can raise to 80 if allowed (must be at least 32). We need to consider risk: if opponent has Jx, they may call or raise. If they have a set (JJ), they'd raise. But they checked, likely not a set.

Actually J T would give A K Q J T = Broadway straight, but board missing J and T, so they would need both J and T in hand to make straight, improbable.

Actually board is 8c 6s 7d, that's a 6-7-8 run, we have 5-5, we have a gutshot straight draw (needs 4 for 4-5-6-7-8) and also a set? No, we have pair of fives, not on board. So we have middle pair, but board is connected, possible straight possibilities for opponents: they could have 9-5? Actually 9-5 would give straight 5-6-7-8-9, but we have 5s 5c, not 9. They could have 9-9 (set of 9s) not possible because board has no 9. Opponents could have 8-9 (open-ended), 5-9 (makes straight). Also they could have 4-5 (makes straight). So we are vulnerable.\n\nWe are in BB, called a raise of 32 (so pot after preflop: blinds 8+16 =24, raise 32 (so total 32 from mini?), Actually preflop: Seat4 raise 32 (so 32 total, meaning they raised to 32, so they added 16 more? Actually blind is 16, raise to 32 means they put 32 total, so they added 16 more). Then seat5 call 24 (so we called 24 more? Wait we posted SB 8? Actually seat5 is BB, posted BB 16, then seat4 raise 32, seat5 call 24 (so we put 24 more to match 32 total). So pot now: 8 (SB) +16 (BB) +32 (raise) +24 (call) =80, matches pot.\n\nNow flop 8c 6s 7d. We have 5-5. So we have a pair, plus a gutshot to straight (needs 4). Also we have a backdoor flush draw? Suits: we have 5s, 5c, board has 8c, 6s, 7d. We have one spade (5s) and one club (5c). Two spades on board? Only 6s. So we have 2 spades? Actually we have 5s, board has 6s, so two spades, need two more spades for flush. Not great.\n\nOur stack 304 chips, pot 80. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) is at seat4, has 141 chips. He raised preflop, so likely strong. On flop, we have to decide. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call is 0 (so opponent hasn't acted yet? Actually it's our turn, after flop? The actions list only preflop. So now it's our turn to act first? Usually action is from left of button, but BB is after UTG? Actually flop action starts with first active player left of button (SB). SB is folded? Seat1 folded preflop. So first active is seat4 (MiniMax). So it's MiniMax's turn first. But we have no actions yet listed for flop. Actually we need to act after MiniMax. So currently amount to call is 0 because no bet yet. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need to decide: Should we check and see? Pocket fives are weak on this board, but we have a gutshot and pair. Opponent may have 8,6,7 combos, or straight draws. He raised preflop, likely has strong range: maybe high cards, broadways, maybe 9T, etc. On flop 8-6-7, his range includes: 8x, 6x, 7x, 9-8, 9-7, 9-6, 5-9 (straight), 4-5 (straight), etc. He may have a made hand like 8-8 (set), 6-6 (set), 7-7 (set), or two pair like 8-7, 8-6, 7-6, or a straight like 9-5, 4-5. Our pair of fives is low, likely behind many.\n\nGiven our stack 304, opponent 141, pot 80. If we raise, we could try to represent a strong hand, but risk being called and we are behind. Check might allow opponent to bet, we can decide to call or raise later. But we have limited stack relative to opponent? Actually we have more chips.\n\nWe can also consider raising to protect against draws. But we have a weak hand. Likely best to check and fold to a bet, or maybe call a small bet? Let's see opponent's tendencies"

They could have 9-9 (set of 9s) not possible because board has no 9. Opponents could have 8-9 (open-ended), 5-9 (makes straight). Also they could have 4-5 (makes straight). So we are vulnerable.\n\nWe are in BB, called a raise of 32 (so pot after preflop: blinds 8+16 =24, raise 32 (so total 32 from mini?), Actually preflop: Seat4 raise 32 (so 32 total, meaning they raised to 32, so they added 16 more? Actually blind is 16, raise to 32 means they put 32 total, so they added 16 more). Then seat5 call 24 (so we called 24 more? Wait we posted SB 8? Actually seat5 is BB, posted BB 16, then seat4 raise 32, seat5 call 24 (so we put 24 more to match 32 total). So pot now: 8 (SB) +16 (BB) +32 (raise) +24 (call) =80, matches pot.\n\nNow flop 8c 6s 7d. We have 5-5. So we have a pair, plus a gutshot to straight (needs 4). Also we have a backdoor flush draw? Suits: we have 5s, 5c, board has 8c, 6s, 7d. We have one spade (5s) and one club (5c). Two spades on board? Only 6s. So we have 2 spades? Actually we have 5s, board has 6s, so two spades, need two more spades for flush. Not great.\n\nOur stack 304 chips, pot 80. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) is at seat4, has 141 chips. He raised preflop, so likely strong. On flop, we have to decide. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call is 0 (so opponent hasn't acted yet? Actually it's our turn, after flop? The actions list only preflop. So now it's our turn to act first? Usually action is from left of button, but BB is after UTG? Actually flop action starts with first active player left of button (SB). SB is folded? Seat1 folded preflop. So first active is seat4 (MiniMax). So it's MiniMax's turn first. But we have no actions yet listed for flop. Actually we need to act after MiniMax. So currently amount to call is 0 because no bet yet. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need to decide: Should we check and see? Pocket fives are weak on this board, but we have a gutshot and pair. Opponent may have 8,6,7 combos, or straight draws. He raised preflop, likely has strong range: maybe high cards, broadways, maybe 9T, etc. On flop 8-6-7, his range includes: 8x, 6x, 7x, 9-8, 9-7, 9-6, 5-9 (straight), 4-5 (straight), etc. He may have a made hand like 8-8 (set), 6-6 (set), 7-7 (set), or two pair like 8-7, 8-6, 7-6, or a straight like 9-5, 4-5. Our pair of fives is low, likely behind many.\n\nGiven our stack 304, opponent 141, pot 80. If we raise, we could try to represent a strong hand, but risk being called and we are behind. Check might allow opponent to bet, we can decide to call or raise later. But we have limited stack relative to opponent? Actually we have more chips.\n\nWe can also consider raising to protect against draws. But we have a weak hand. Likely best to check and fold to a bet, or maybe call a small bet? Let's see opponent's tendencies",

Board is 8-6-7-Q, we have 5-5, so we have a gutshot straight draw (needs 4 to make 4-5-6-7-8). Also we have a set? No, board doesn't have a 5, so we have a pair of fives, which is currently second pair (pair of 5s vs board Q,8,7,6). Actually board has no pair, so we have a pair of 5s, which is low. Opponent is MiniMax-M2 with 141 chips, likely the only remaining opponent (others folded). Preflop: MiniMax raised to 32, we called. Flop: board 8c 6s 7d, we checked, they checked. Turn: board Qd appears. Pot now 80 chips. It's our turn (BB). Opponent's stack 141, we have 304. So we are big stack relative. Opponent's actions: preflop raise 32, we called, flop check-check. So opponent may be passive or checking with a marginal hand. Turn Qd is a scary card: they could have Qx, they could have straight draws (9-10?). Actually board now 8-6-7-Q, they could have a straight: 5-9? No. Straight combos: 5-9? Need 5-9 to make 5-6-7-8-9? No board 6-7-8, need 5 and 9 to make 5-6-7-8-9, but we have 5s5c; they could have 9-5 but we have both fives, so they can't have 5. So possible straight: 9-10? 9-10 would make 6-7-8-9-10? No need 6-7-8-9-10, board has 8,6,7, need 9-10 for open-ended straight? Actually board 6-7-8, with turn Q, you need 9-10 to have open-ended? Not relevant. They could have a pair of Queens, two pair, etc. Could have a set of 8? No 8 on board, they could have 8x for trips. They could have 6x for trips, etc.\n\nOur hand is weak: pair of fives, gutshot to a straight (needs 4). Also could make a set on river if a 5 hits, but low chance.\n\nWe need to decide action. Options: check (0 call) or raise (minimum raise 16). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. There's no bet to call, so we can check or raise.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, likely best to check. But consider opponent's tendencies: they checked flop, maybe they have a weak hand, could be checking to see river. If we bet, we could try to steal the pot. Pot is 80, we have 304 chips. If we bet 16 (minimum raise) we could take pot. But opponent could call with many hands. Since we have low equity, maybe better to check and see river.\n\nWe could also consider a small raise to try to take down pot. But opponent might call with many draws. Our hand is not strong; raising could risk chips. Check seems safe.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nWe need to output JSON.\n\n",

Wait we have 5s5c, board has pair of 6s, plus 8,7,Q. So our best 5-card hand: 6-6-5-5-Q? Actually we can use both fives and both sixes: that is two pair, sixes and fives, with queen kicker. That's two pair, not a full house. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) unknown cards. Board also has straight possibilities: 8-6-7-? Actually 6-7-8 is three consecutive; need 5 or 9 for straight.

To have full house, they'd need a hand that pairs board and also pairs another board rank: e.g., 8-8 gives full house 8s over 6s, or 7-7 gives full house 7s over 6s, or Q-Q gives full house Qs over 6s, or 6-x gives trips but not full house unless they have a pair?

Actually actions: seat1 posted sb 8, seat4 posted bb 16. No other raises yet. So we are to act facing a 16 (big blind) amount to call? Actually amount to call is 16 (the big blind). So we can call 16 to see flop, raise minimum to 32 (i.e., raise total to 32). Our hand is K9 offsuit, not a premium hand but decent in position. Consider stack depth: 24 BB, tournament early? Not given but we have decent stack. Opponent MiniMax-M2 is BB with 125 chips (7.8 BB). So they are short-stacked relative to us. They posted BB 16, leaving 109 effective stack. Our raise would be 32 total (i.e., 16 more). That would be 2 BB raise. That might put pressure on short stack. But K9 offsuit is marginal for a raise in early tournament? In BTN vs BB, you can raise to steal blinds. Since BB is short, they may call or shove. However, they have 125 chips, about 7.8 BB. In many tournaments, a short stack may be inclined to shove all-in when facing a raise. So raising might get us all-in for 32 (our raise) vs their 125. Actually if we raise to 32, they'd have to call 16 more (i.e., put 32 total). That's a relatively small risk. Could also just call 16 and see flop. But K9 offsuit is not a strong hand to call and see flop out of position (but we are BTN). However we have position post-flop, which is valuable. With 24 BB, we can afford a raise to try to pick up blinds. Also opponent's raise pattern: from recall, they raised 4,8,16,32 in previous hands (preflop). Those are small raises relative to blinds? Not sure. Those were raise amounts (maybe total raise amounts). They have been raising small amounts. So they may be aggressive or just raise to see flop. Might be okay to raise.\n\nGiven we have King high, potential to hit top pair, decent equity. I'd raise to 32 to apply pressure and possibly win blinds. Reason: position, decent hand, short stack opponent likely to call all-in or fold, and we can win chips.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 32.\n\n",

Board: T T T K. We have 9 and 7, could have a straight draw? Need 8 and J for straight? Actually board has T T T K, we have 9,7. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q? Not. So we have no made hand, just 9-high. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 16 into pot 48, so pot after bet will be 48+16=64? Actually pot before bet 48, opponent bets 16, now amount to call 16, pot effective 64 (including opponent's bet). Our stack 392. Need to evaluate opponent's range. They are short stack 93 chips, likely looking to steal or push with strong hand. Board is very favorable for many hands: any Ten, any set, any full house, any quads. Opponent could have a Ten (makes quads), a K (makes full house KTTT), a 9 (makes full house 9TTT? Actually 9 with board TTTK gives full house 9s over Tens? Wait full house requires three of a kind plus a pair. Board already has three tens, so any other pair gives full house: e.g., 9 9 gives 9s over tens? Actually board TTTK plus 9 9 gives two nines, board has three tens, so you have full house: tens full of nines? Actually you have 9 9 plus board T T T K. You have a pair of nines, board has three tens, so you have full house: tens full of nines (TTT99). So any pocket pair (except tens) gives full house. Also any Ten gives quads. Also any K gives full house KTTT? Actually K with board gives K K T T T? You have K + board K? Actually board Kd, you have K? If you have Kx, you have pair of Ks plus triple tens = full house K over tens. So many strong combos.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely we should fold. But consider possibility of bluff? Opponent short stack might be trying to steal pot with missed draw, but board is scary. We have 9c7s no flush draw, no straight draw, no pair. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe consider hand strength: A3 offsuit is weak, especially in SB facing a BB and a caller. It's a marginal hand, not a good raise. Could call to see flop cheap? In SB with 24 BB stack, calling 8 is 0.5 BB, which is okay to see flop. However, the opponent (MiniMax-M2) seems to call often preflop, maybe passive. Not much info on Kimi-K2 (seat1) as they are BB and haven't acted yet (they are BB). Actually seat1 is BB, they posted 16 already. So after we act, then BB will act (Kimi-K2). We need to consider that BB could raise. If we call, we will be out of position postflop, but we have A3, not great. Might consider folding to preserve stack. However, 8 is cheap. In tournament, with 24 BB, you can afford to call a few cheap hands. A3 suited? It's offsuit, not great. But could be used to steal? No, we're SB, not raising.\n\nGiven the opponent's behavior: MiniMax-M2 often just calls, rarely raises. So likely they have a wide range. The BB (Kimi-K2) unknown. Could be tight or loose. If we call and BB raises, we are forced to fold likely. So calling is low risk.\n\nThus best action: call 8.

Actually seat 1 is BB, they checked preflop. So both are in. The pot is 48 chips. No bet on flop yet; it's our turn (SB) after seat 4 called preflop and seat 1 checked. Actually order: SB posted 8, BB posted 16, seat 4 called 16, seat 5 (SB) called 8 (so we are in). Then seat 1 (BB) checked. So flop action order: seat 4 (MiniMax) acts first, then seat 5 (us), then seat 1 (BB). But we have the flop board, and actions listed: amount to call 0, legal actions fold, check, raise. So presumably MiniMax checked? Wait we didn't see MiniMax's flop action. The \"Actions this hand\" only includes preflop actions. So on flop we need to decide. But we have no info of MiniMax's action yet; likely it's our turn first? Actually SB is seat 5, BB is seat 1, seat 4 is MP? The order on flop: seat 4 (MP) first, then seat 5 (SB), then seat 1 (BB). Since no actions listed, we are at seat 5's turn? Actually seat 4 may have acted already; maybe they bet? But we don't know. The prompt says \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning no bet currently. So we can check or raise. Need to decide based on hand strength and opponent tendencies.\n\nWe have a decent hand: top pair A kicker. MiniMax's flop betting pattern: historically they bet small amounts (4,4,6,4,8) and one larger (20). So they are capable of betting small to protect. Could be they would bet here. Since no bet, maybe they checked. So we can either check or raise. Considering stack: we have 376 chips, pot 48. Raising could build pot, but also risk if opponent has a better hand (e.g., 9x, 2x, straight draws). Board is relatively dry. Our hand is strong but not nuts; 9x could be overpair; also 2-3 combos could have two pair, but we have top pair with Ace kicker. Could be we want to protect against draws (like 45 for straight draw). Actually 45 gives open-ended straight draw (4-5). That's possible. Opponent could have 45, but they'd likely bet. Since they didn't, maybe they have weak hand.\n\nThus we could check to see if BB (Kimi) will bet. But Kimi is short stack? Kimi has 437 chips, bigger than us. Could be they will bet. Checking might allow them to bet, and we could call or raise later.\n\nGiven we have top pair, I think we should raise to protect and extract value. Minimum raise is 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). That is small, but we could raise bigger, maybe to 48 (pot). However we have to consider opponent's stack: MiniMax has 125 chips. Raising to 48 would be okay. But we need to decide based on legal raise amount? Minimum raise to 16, but we can raise any amount up to our stack. Usually we raise to about 2.5x pot. So maybe raise to 80 chips.\n\nBut we need to consider that if we raise too much, they may fold better hands (like 9x). But we want value from weaker hands (like 3x with weak kicker). So moderate raise.\n\nThus I will raise to 80 chips. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

Actually board has two twos and a three, so board is a pair of twos with a three. Our hand gives us a pair of threes, making two pair (threes and twos). So we have two pair, tens?

Wait blinds: seat5 posted sb 8, seat1 posted bb 16, seat4 called 16 (big blind), seat5 call 8 (to match big blind). So pot after preflop = 8+16+16+8 = 48? Actually sb 8 + bb 16 + call 16 + call 8 = 48. Then seat1 checked, seat5 bet 80 on flop, seat1 folded, seat4 called 80. So pot after flop: previous 48 + 80*2 = 208. Yes matches pot.\n\nNow turn: board adds 2s, making board: 2h 3d 9s 2s. So board now has trips of twos? Actually two twos, not three. So board has pair of twos.

Actually his total investment so far: 16 preflop + 80 flop = 96. He has 45 left, so his total stack is 141? Wait his total stack originally maybe larger but now only 45 left.

Minimum raise to 80 (so raise must be at least 80 total). But opponent only has 45, so if we raise to 80, he'll be all-in for 45 (we can call his all-in). But raise to 80 is a raise of 80 total, meaning we add 80 to pot? Actually we have amount to call 0 (since opponent hasn't acted yet). Minimum raise to 80 means we need to put at least 80 chips into pot, raising to 80 total (since amount to call is 0). That is a raise of 80. That would be a bet of 80.

They have 45 chips left, we have 296. They are short-stacked. Likely they are on the button? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, probably UTG? Not needed.\n\nWe need to decide action. Opponent's stack small, they could be all-in any time. On river, they have checked. We can check or raise. Raising could be a value bet if we think we have best hand. What is likely opponent's range? Preflop they called 16 in BB, then flop they called 80 after our bet, indicating they have a decent hand or draw. Turn they checked. River board: 2h 3d 9s 2s Qd. Possible opponent holdings: Could have 2x (full house), could have 9x, Qx, maybe a straight draw? No straight possible. Could have a set of 2s (full house) if they have 2x. Could have 9x (pair). Could have Qx (pair). Could have A2? But we have Ace. Could have A2? That's two pair (A2). But board has 2s and 3d, we have A3, we have two pair Aces and Threes? Actually we have Ace and 3c, board 2,3,9,2,Q. So we have pair of threes (one on board, one in hand) and Ace high. So we have two pair? No, we have pair of threes, not two pair. Opponent could have 2x making trips or full house. Could have Qx making pair of queens. Could have 9x making pair of nines. Could have A2 making two pair (Aces and twos). Could have A3 making two pair (Aces and threes) but we have that. Could have A9 etc.\n\nOur hand is relatively weak. Likely opponent has better hand. So we should check and possibly fold if they bet. Since amount to call is 0, checking is safe. Raising could be bluff but opponent is short stacked; they might call all-in with any pair. Better to check and see if they bet; we can fold.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Wait seat5 is us, BB posted 16? Actually actions: Seat5 post_sb 8 (so seat5 also posted small blind? That seems odd: seat5 is BB but posted SB? Might be they are in BB seat but also SB? Possibly seat5 is BB and also posted SB because seat5 is BB? Actually typical: seat5 is BB, seat4 is SB. But actions show seat5 post_sb 8, seat1 post_bb 16, seat4 fold. So seat5 is SB? But description says Position: BB (Seat5). So maybe they swapped: seat5 is BB but posted SB? Might be a mistake. Anyway amount to call is 8 (the SB). Minimum raise to 32. So we are facing a bet of 8 from the SB (our own blind?), Actually we are in BB, we posted 16, and the SB posted 8, then we need to call 8 to match SB? Actually after blinds, the action goes to UTG etc, but here only seat5 (SB) posted 8, seat1 (BB) posted 16, seat4 folded. So we are SB? But they said Position: BB (Seat5). The pot is 24 (8+16). Amount to call 8 means we need to call the BB's 16? Wait confusion.\n\nProbably we are in BB and we posted 16, and the SB (seat5?) posted 8? Actually seat5 is us, they posted SB 8, then seat1 posted BB 16, seat4 folded. So we are SB? But they say Position: BB (Seat5). So maybe the seat numbers are off. Regardless, we have to act facing a bet of 8 (the BB's 16? Actually we need to call 8). So we can call 8, raise to at least 32.\n\nOur hand 9d Js is a suited jack-nine off-suit? Actually Js is spade, 9d diamond. So unsuited. That's a marginal hand in early position (BB). Stack 17 BB. Need to decide.\n\nWe need opponent tendencies. Opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat1). We have recall of recent raises: they raised 24 preflop (3bb) in hands 54,56,59,60, and 48 in hand69 (3bb? Actually 48 is 3bb? With blinds 8/16, 3bb is 48? Yes 16*3=48). So they tend to raise 3bb preflop.\n\nNow they are the BB? Actually seat1 is BB with 16 posted. They raised? Wait we are acting after seat1 posted BB 16, and seat4 folded. So it's our turn to act (BB? Actually we are SB?). The amount to call is 8 (the SB). So we can call the BB's 16? Actually we need to call 8 to match the BB? In typical scenario: SB posts 8, BB posts 16, then action goes to UTG. If everyone folds, then SB can check, BB can check. But here it's preflop and only SB and BB are left, and it's SB's turn? Actually after posting blinds, action goes to first player left of BB (UTG). If everyone folds, then SB gets first action. Since seat4 folded, seat5 (SB) would act first, but they already posted SB. So they can check or raise. Amount to call is 8 (the BB's 16? No, to call the BB's 16 you need to put 8 more). So we need to call 8 to match BB's 16. So we can call 8, raise to 32 (total), or fold.\n\nOur hand 9-J off-suit is not strong enough to raise here, especially against a player who may be willing to defend with a wide range. But we are short stack 17BB, still enough to play.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to raise preflop when they are in BB? Actually they have been raising when they are in BB? Not sure. But they have been raising 3bb when they are BB? Could be they raise from BB as a continuation after being first to act? Actually they are BB, they posted 16, then they might raise preflop (like a raise after SB). But here they just posted BB, no raise.\n\nWe can call 8 and see flop. 9-J suited? Actually unsuited. Might be okay to limp? But we have 17BB, we can limp and see flop"

Actually after flop, action starts with first active player left of the button? Usually SB acts first preflop, then flop first to left of button (UTG).

Actually we are BB, they posted BB 16, we posted SB 8? Wait position: we are BB seat5, they are seat1 (maybe UTG?). Preflop actions: seat5 post_sb 8 (so we are small blind). seat1 post_bb 16 (big blind). So we are SB, they are BB. Both check flop. So on turn, amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. Opponent's tendencies on turn: from recall, they often check or fold, rarely raise. They have raised on turn once (hand 25) amount 72, maybe with strong hand.

Our stack 264, opponent 437. We are short stacked relative to opponent but still 16.5 BB. We are out of position (SB vs BB). Should we check and hope they check? Likely they will check. Checking is safe. Raising would be a bluff; but with only J high, not a good bluff against a player who may call with decent Kx or even a pair. Could we try a small raise to steal? Minimum raise to 16, which is 16 total (so raise of 16?). Actually raise to 16 means we put total 16 chips? Since amount to call 0, raise to 16 would be a bet of 16 chips. Pot is 32, bet 16 is 0.5 pot. Might get called by Kx, or they may fold weaker. But risk losing stack if they have Kx. Our hand is weak, so better to check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nWe need JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We are on river, board: Kc 3c 7c 4h Tc. Our hand: 9d Js. So we have a straight? Let's see: board has Kc 3c 7c 4h Tc. Our cards: 9d Js. Combined we have J9. The board has T, K, 3,7,4. Straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K? We have 9 and J, board has T and K, missing Q. No Q, so not straight. Flush? Board has three clubs (Kc,3c,7c). Our cards: 9d Js, no clubs, so no flush. Pair? We have J, board has J? No. Board has T, we have J, no pair. So high card J. Board highest card is K. So we have J high, board K high. So we are likely losing unless opponent also has nothing better? But opponent could have K, etc. So we should consider check or raise? Amount to call 0, pot 32. Opponent (Seat1 Kimi-K2) has 437 chips. He checked earlier on turn and river? Actually actions: preflop: seat1 posted bb 16, seat5 call 8, seat1 check. Flop both check, turn both check. River: we have amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. So opponent hasn't acted on river yet; it's our turn? Actually order: Since seat1 is in BB, seat5 is SB. Preflop SB posted 8, BB posted 16, then SB called 8, BB checked. So after flop, turn, river, the action order is SB first (seat5), then BB (seat1). So on river, seat5 acts first. So we can check or raise. If we raise, we risk being called by a better hand. Our hand is weak. So likely check and hope opponent checks and we lose small pot. But maybe we could bluff? Opponent's stack is 437, pot 32. If we raise to, say, 32 (all-in?), we could steal. But our stack is 264, can raise up to maybe 32 min raise? Minimum raise is 16 (to total 16). Actually current bet is 0, min raise is 16 (to 16). We could raise to 16, 32, etc. But we have 264, can raise any amount. But is opponent likely to fold? He might have a king, or a pair, or a straight draw? Board: Kc 3c 7c 4h Tc. He could have a king, or a pair of tens, or a flush draw missed, etc. He could also have a straight draw like QJ? Actually QJ would be a straight (J-Q-K). Wait board has K and T, QJ would be QJ K T? That's not a straight. Straight combos: 9-10-J-Q-K needs Q and 9. He could have Q9 for straight, but board has T and K, need J and Q? Actually 9-10-J-Q-K includes 9,10,J,Q,K. Board has K and T, we have J9, missing Q. Opponent could have Q9, they'd have Q9 + board K T => Q-K? Not a straight. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q: board has 10, we have J, need 8 and Q. Not there. So straight unlikely. So opponent likely has at least a pair of K, T, or maybe a flush draw missed. So raising may get called.\n\nThus best is to check. Reason: weak hand, low chance to win, risk losing more chips. Checking loses only pot 32. So output check.\n\n",

Actually we have J9, board has T, so we have a gutshot straight draw: 9-J gives us 9-10-J, need Q or 8? Let's see possible straight: 9-10-J-Q-K would need Q. Or 7-8-9-10-J would need 8. We have neither. So we have just J high plus a pair? No pair. We have J high, plus we have a backdoor flush? Board has three clubs, we have no clubs. So we have nothing, just J high (or maybe a gutshot draw that missed). Opponent bet 52 into pot 84, so pot now 84+52 = 136 (if we call). Our stack 264, we can call.\n\nWe need to consider opponent's tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking has only checked river previously in many hands. In this hand they bet 52. Could be bluff or value. What could they have? Board: Kc 3c 7c 4h Tc. Possible holdings: K high (Kx), T, maybe a straight draw, maybe a flush draw (clubs). They could have a hand like Kc Tc (two pair), or a set? No set possible (no pair on board). Could be a straight like QJ (but board has T, so QJ would make straight Q-J-10-9-8? No). Actually board has K, T, 3, 7, 4. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q (needs 8 and Q). Not present. So no straight on board. So only made hands are pairs: K, T, maybe two pair K+T? Actually board has K and T, each single. So if opponent has Kx, they'd have pair of K; if Tx they'd have pair of T; if they have both K and T they'd have two pair. Also could have a flush draw that missed. Could have a club like Ac for Ace-high flush draw but missed. Could have a straight draw missed.\n\nGiven they bet 52 (about 62% of pot), could be value bet with K, T, or two pair. Could be bluff. How often does Kimi-K2 Thinking bluff? Past river actions show they always checked, never bet. So maybe they are passive and only bet when they have value. So likely they have a decent hand.\n\nOur hand is weak: J high, no pair. So we should fold.\n\nCheck stack: 264 chips, 16.5 BB, tournament early? Might need to preserve chips. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop with Ah4s on BTN, 16.5 BB, stacks: Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat1) has 461 chips, MiniMax-M2 (seat4) BB 237 chips. Blinds 8/16. We are BTN, after SB and BB posted, it's our turn. Amount to call 16 (BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise by at least 16). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nConsider hand: Ace-4 offsuit, not great. In BTN, can steal blinds often, but our stack is short (16.5 BB). Opponents: Kimi-K2 Thinking (SB) has been raising preflop often? Data shows raise to 24 (i.e., 3BB) in several hands, and one raise to 48 (6BB). That suggests they are aggressive, maybe 3-betting? Actually those are their actions preflop: raise from SB? Wait seat1 is SB, they posted 8, then they raise? The data shows raise amounts 24, 48. That suggests they are raising (maybe 3-betting) after someone else? Not sure. But they are aggressive.\n\nMiniMax-M2 (BB) unknown.\n\nOur stack 264 chips, 16.5 BB. The blinds are 8/16, so effective stacks are shallow. If we call 16, we will be left with 248 chips, still decent. If we raise to 32 (i.e., 2x BB), we are putting 32 total, meaning raise 16 more. That would be a 2BB raise (standard). With Ace-4 offsuit, not strong enough to raise maybe. But stealing from SB and BB might be okay. However SB is aggressive and may 3-bet. Our stack is short, but we could go all-in? Minimum raise to 32 is okay; we could also go all-in (264) but that would be huge relative to pot.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, we might just call and see flop, but calling is like limping; in BTN it's okay but with short stack maybe we want to steal. However Ace-4 offsuit is not great for 3-bet, but could be a steal. But if SB is aggressive and may re-raise, we risk being 3-bet and losing chips. Our stack is 16.5 BB, we can afford a raise.\n\nI think best is to raise to 48 (i.e., 3BB) to apply pressure? But min raise is 32. Raising to 32 is standard. Considering SB's aggressiveness, a raise may be called or re-raised. But we have limited chips; if they 3-bet, we may be forced all-in anyway.\n\nGiven the hand is weak, maybe just call and hope to see cheap flop? But calling 16 invests 1BB; if we miss flop, we can fold later. With short stack, we want to preserve chips; limping is okay.\n\nThus decision: call.\n\nReasoning: Weak hand, short stack, SB aggressive, better to just call and see flop, preserve stack.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Actually we have a pair of fours with kicker A. Board: T,J,6,7,4. So we have two pair? No, we have pair of fours, board has no other pair. So we have pair, low. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) checked river. So they likely have weak hand or drawing? Let's consider possible hands: Could have straight? Board: T,J,6,7,4. Straight possible: 8-9? No. 8-9 would need 8 and 9, not present. 9-8? Not. 5-8? Not. So no straight possible. Flush? Board has two clubs (6c,7c) and two spades (Ts,Js). No flush possible with 5 cards? Need 3 clubs or 3 spades among hole+board. Opponent could have two clubs for flush draw but board only has two clubs, need one more club in hand for flush, but they'd need 5 clubs total, not possible (only 2 clubs on board, need 3 in hand, impossible). So no flush. So best possible hand is two pair, trips, or full house. Board: T,J,6,7,4. No pair on board. So opponent could have a pair on board (like T, J, 6, 7) but they need a pocket pair to have pair? Actually they'd need a card matching board rank: e.g., T? they'd have T? That gives them pair of tens with kicker J? Actually they'd have two pair if they have a T and a J? But board has T and J each single. So if opponent holds T and J, they'd have two pair (T,J). That would beat our pair of fours. Also any higher pair like A, K, Q, etc? They could have A? they'd have pair of A's? No board doesn't have A. So they could have a higher pair like A? they'd need A on board, not there. So they'd need a pair in hand (e.g., 9-9) that would be just a pair, but lower than our A kicker? Actually pair 9s would be higher than our pair of fours, because pair of 9s beats pair of 4s. So many possible hands beat us. But opponent checked, maybe they think they are weak. Our hand is weak. So best to check. Could also consider bluff raise? Stack sizes: we have 248 chips, opponent 237. Pot 40. Minimum raise is 16. Raising to 16 would be a small raise (to 16 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 16 means we bet 16). That is about 40% of pot. Could be a semi-bluff? But opponent likely has better hand; they'd call and we lose chips. So better to check and fold if they bet later (but they checked). So choose check.\n\nThus output JSON with action check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Wait seat5 is us, but description says Position: BB (Seat5). However actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 8, Seat1 post_bb 16. So seat5 posted small blind, seat1 posted big blind. That contradicts position label. Might be a mistake; but we treat as we are in SB? Actually we have 2s Jc, we posted small blind 8, and now it's our turn after BB posted 16. So amount to call is 8 (to match BB). So we are in SB with 2J offsuit.\n\nGiven stack 248, we have 15.5 BB effective. 2J is a weak hand, especially off-suit and low kicker. In SB, against a BB who likely defends a wide range, but still 2J is not great. Should we fold? Typically 2J offsuit is a fold from SB vs BB raise. But here it's just a call to BB's blind. Since we are just calling the BB, not raising. But we could raise to 32 min raise. However 2J is not a raising hand. Likely fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised preflop amounts varying, sometimes 12, 16, 24, 48, even 232 (all-in). So they are aggressive and may raise big. So we should be cautious.\n\nThus best to fold.\n\nReturn JSON.",

BB is MiniMax-M2 with 253 chips (16.9 BB). Both have decent stacks.\n\nWe should consider opponent tendencies: recall opponent actions. We retrieved raises by seat 1 (SB). They have raised amounts ranging from 12, 16, 24, 48, sometimes huge (232). So SB can be aggressive, maybe raising wide? Not sure.\n\nWe have no info on BB's tendencies.

If we raise, SB and BB will have to act.\n\nGiven J8 suited, we could consider a steal raise. With 15.5 BB, we could raise to 48 (3x BB) maybe.

Our position and stack size allow a moderate raise (80) that pressures the opponent without over\u2011committing.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have flop: 4d 7d 6d, board is a flush draw (diamonds) and also open-ended straight draw (5 and 8 give straight). Our hand: Jh 8h. So we have gutshot? Actually we have 8h, not diamond, so we have a gutshot straight draw (need 5 for straight 4-5-6-7-8). Also we have a backdoor flush draw (two hearts). Our opponent MiniMax-M2 checked. Stack sizes: we have 200 chips, opponent 221 chips. Pot 104. No bet. We are on button, we raised preflop to 48 (so we have some aggression). Opponent called 32 preflop.\n\nNow flop: opponent checks. Options: check, bet (raise). Minimum raise is 32 (so raise to at least 32? Actually raise to total 32? The min raise is 32 which is the amount to raise total? Usually min raise is current bet + 2*big blind? But here they say minimum raise to: 32. So we can raise to 32 total? That would be a raise of 32 (i.e., bet 32). Since no bet, raising to 32 means bet 32.\n\nWe need to decide: do we bet? Hand is a draw, not strong. Pot 104, bet 32 gives pot odds to opponent about 32/(104+32)=23.5% required to call. Opponent has about 221 chips, could call. If opponent is tight, might fold. If opponent is loose, may call.\n\nWe should consider opponent tendencies: recall shows they often check on flop, sometimes call a bet. In recent hands, they checked and sometimes folded after bet? Not shown. They have a pattern of checking. Could be passive.\n\nWe have position, decent stack, can try to take pot now with semi-bluff. Our hand has both straight and backdoor flush draws, plus we have some equity (~12%? Actually open-ended? We have gutshot straight draw (8, need 5) and backdoor flush (needs two diamonds). So about 12%? Might be okay to bet as semi-bluff.\n\nBut we also could check and see turn. Turn will be unknown. If we check, we give free card. Turn could give us straight or flush draw. Could be good. However, checking may allow opponent to bet if they have a pair, etc.\n\nGiven we are short stack 12.5 BB, we might want to be aggressive to pick up pot now rather than risk later. But we also have limited chips; we could go all-in? Minimum raise is 32, but we could raise more. Our stack 200, we could raise to say 120 (half pot) to apply pressure. But we need to consider risk.\n\nOpponent stack similar, but they are behind us preflop raise. They may have a range: could have a diamond, could have a pair, could have a straight draw.\n\nGiven board is all diamonds, opponent may have a flush draw. If we bet, we risk being called by flush draw that beats us. But we also have equity.\n\nI think a semi-bluff raise to about 80 (pot+bet) could be good. However, we have limited chips; raising to 80 still leaves us with 120. Could be okay.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot bet less than min raise 32. Could raise to 80. That is a raise.\n\nThus decision: raise to 80. Reason: semi-bluff with straight and backdoor flush draw, protect against free cards, leverage position.\n\nI'll output JSON.",

          "content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: we are BTN with Jh 8h. Board: 4d 7d 6d Ts. So we have a gutshot straight draw? Actually we have J h and 8 h. Board: 4d 7d 6d T s. No diamonds except 4d 7d 6d. We have two hearts, but board has no hearts. So we have a flush draw? No, need 2 more hearts, we have two hearts, need 3 hearts on board, not possible. So no flush. Straight possibilities: board is 4-6-7-10. We have J8. Could make straight with 9? Let's see combos: 6-7-8-9-10 would be straight, we have 8, need 9 on river. Also 7-8-9-10-J would be straight, need 9 also. So we have an open-ended straight draw? Actually we have 8 and J, board has 6,7,10. The possible straight draws: need 9 for both. Also need 5 for 4-5-6-7-8? We have 8, need 5. So we have two outs (9 and 5). Actually 5 also works: 4-5-6-7-8, yes we have 8, need 5. So we have two outs: 5 and 9 (four each = 8 outs). Not huge.\n\nWe have bet on flop 80 into pot 264? Actually pot before flop bet: preflop pot: we raised to 48, opponent called 32, so pot = 48+32+ blinds? Blinds 8+16=24, so total preflop pot 104? Wait compute: SB 8, BB 16, raise to 48 (so total put by us 48), opponent call 32 (they already posted 16, so they add 16 more? Actually call 32 means they put total 32, but they already posted 16, so they add 16). So pot after preflop: SB 8 + BB 16 + our 48 + opponent 32 = 104. Flop bet 80 from us, opponent called 80, so pot now 104 + 80*2 = 264. Yes.\n\nTurn: opponent checked. So pot is 264, we have 120 chips left total, we have already invested: preflop 48, flop 80 = 128. Stack left 120.\n\nNow turn we have option to check or raise. Minimum raise to 80 (so raise to 80 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in? The raise minimum is 80, meaning we need to put total bet 80? But we have already 0 to call, so raising to 80 means we put 80 chips. That would be a bet of 80 into pot 264, about 30% of pot. Our stack is 120, we could raise to 80 (leaving 40). Could also go all-in 120.\n\nConsider opponent: MiniMax-M2 with 141 chips left. He checked turn after we bet flop 80 and he called. He likely has a hand that can call flop but not confident on turn. Could be a pair like T, 6, 7, 4, maybe a draw. Our hand Jh8h has some equity but not strong.\n\nWe need tournament considerations: we are short stack 7.5 BB, need to accumulate chips. Opponent has 141 chips, about 9 BB. So both are short. Should we try to steal? Our hand is not strong enough to value bet, but we could try to bluff. Turn board: 4d 7d 6d Ts. No hearts, no obvious draws. Our bet on flop could have represented a strong hand like a set or two pair? But board is rainbow, no flush draws. Our flop bet of 80 into 104 pot (80% pot) is fairly strong.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: we are BTN with Jh 8h. Board: 4d 7d 6d Ts. So we have a gutshot straight draw? Actually we have J h and 8 h. Board: 4d 7d 6d T s. No diamonds except 4d 7d 6d. We have two hearts, but board has no hearts. So we have a flush draw? No, need 2 more hearts, we have two hearts, need 3 hearts on board, not possible. So no flush. Straight possibilities: board is 4-6-7-10. We have J8. Could make straight with 9? Let's see combos: 6-7-8-9-10 would be straight, we have 8, need 9 on river. Also 7-8-9-10-J would be straight, need 9 also. So we have an open-ended straight draw? Actually we have 8 and J, board has 6,7,10. The possible straight draws: need 9 for both. Also need 5 for 4-5-6-7-8? We have 8, need 5. So we have two outs (9 and 5). Actually 5 also works: 4-5-6-7-8, yes we have 8, need 5. So we have two outs: 5 and 9 (four each = 8 outs). Not huge.\n\nWe have bet on flop 80 into pot 264? Actually pot before flop bet: preflop pot: we raised to 48, opponent called 32, so pot = 48+32+ blinds? Blinds 8+16=24, so total preflop pot 104? Wait compute: SB 8, BB 16, raise to 48 (so total put by us 48), opponent call 32 (they already posted 16, so they add 16 more? Actually call 32 means they put total 32, but they already posted 16, so they add 16). So pot after preflop: SB 8 + BB 16 + our 48 + opponent 32 = 104. Flop bet 80 from us, opponent called 80, so pot now 104 + 80*2 = 264. Yes.\n\nTurn: opponent checked. So pot is 264, we have 120 chips left total, we have already invested: preflop 48, flop 80 = 128. Stack left 120.\n\nNow turn we have option to check or raise. Minimum raise to 80 (so raise to 80 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in? The raise minimum is 80, meaning we need to put total bet 80? But we have already 0 to call, so raising to 80 means we put 80 chips. That would be a bet of 80 into pot 264, about 30% of pot. Our stack is 120, we could raise to 80 (leaving 40). Could also go all-in 120.\n\nConsider opponent: MiniMax-M2 with 141 chips left. He checked turn after we bet flop 80 and he called. He likely has a hand that can call flop but not confident on turn. Could be a pair like T, 6, 7, 4, maybe a draw. Our hand Jh8h has some equity but not strong.\n\nWe need tournament considerations: we are short stack 7.5 BB, need to accumulate chips. Opponent has 141 chips, about 9 BB. So both are short. Should we try to steal? Our hand is not strong enough to value bet, but we could try to bluff. Turn board: 4d 7d 6d Ts. No hearts, no obvious draws. Our bet on flop could have represented a strong hand like a set or two pair? But board is rainbow, no flush draws. Our flop bet of 80 into 104 pot (80% pot) is fairly strong. Opponent called, maybe they have a hand like T9, 87, 76, etc. He checked turn, maybe he missed a draw.\n\nIf we check turn, we give free river, likely lose if opponent bets. Could also check and hope river card hits our straight draw (5 or 9). But we have 8 outs, pot 264, bet 0, opponent could bet. If they bet, we might call with draws?

Seat1 raised to 48 (so raise of 32 over big blind). Amount to call is 32. Minimum raise to 80 (i.e., raise total to 80). But we have only 24 chips total, which is less than call amount 32, so we are short-stacked: we cannot call full amount, but we can go all-in for 24 chips. However legal actions only list fold, call. Usually in such scenario, you can go all-in as a call (i.e., call all-in for remaining stack). The tool says if you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in. But legal actions only include fold, call, not raise. So we can call (which will be all-in). So decision: call (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, decent hand but not premium, need to gamble. TQ offsuit is marginal; but we are forced to call all-in or fold. Better to call because we have some equity and we are short.\n\nThus output JSON with action \"call\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

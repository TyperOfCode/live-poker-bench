Very strong, especially on the button.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is the best position post-flop.\n3. **Opponents**: Both opponents appear tight. The SB has been very tight, folding most hands. The BB has also been tight but will defend their blind occasionally.\n4. **Stack Size**: I have a healthy stack (64.5 BB), so I can afford to play this hand aggressively.\n5. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1), which is fine but raising is better with this hand.\n\nWith KQs on the button against tight opponents, this is a clear raise. I want to:\n- Build the pot with my strong hand\n- Isolate one opponent\n- Take advantage of my position\n- Put pressure on the blinds\n\nGiven the minimum raise is 8 (2x BB), I should raise larger to get value and define the hand. A standard raise would be 3x BB = 12 chips. However, looking at the pattern:\n- Hand 23: SB raised to 12 (3x BB)\n- Hand 24: BB raised to 8 (2x BB when they were not in BB)\n\nI'll make a standard raise of 12 chips (3x BB) to build the pot and get value from my strong hand.",

Q3o is one of the weakest hands in poker, especially out of position against a likely strong range. The pot odds (3.75:1) aren't good enough to justify calling with such a weak kicker, especially considering I'll be out of position for all future betting rounds.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Qh 3c is a very weak hand with terrible kicker.

Stack: 201 chips (50.2 BB) - Decent stack size\n5. Pot: 18 chips\n\nFrom my memory tools:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has been active with raises - I can see they've raised 4 times in recent hands (hand #4, #9, #21, #22), with preflop raises of 4, 12, and 12 chips\n- My recent history shows I've been folding a lot (22 folds out of 25 hands, only 12% win rate)\n- In my last few hands, I've been playing very tight and mostly folding\n\nAnalysis:\n- Qh 3c is a very weak hand, especially out of position\n- The kicker (3) is terrible - even if I hit a Queen, I'll lose to anyone with a better kicker\n- I'm out of position, which makes this hand even worse\n- The raise from Kimi-K2 Thinking suggests they have a decent hand\n- With 50+ BBs, I don't need to take risks with marginal hands\n- Pot odds: I need to call 8 to win 18+ chips (pot is 18, plus their 12 = 30 total), so I'd be getting about 3.75:1 odds. However, this doesn't account for future betting rounds where I'd be out of position\n\nGiven that:\n1. This is a very weak hand (Q3o)\n2. I'm out of position\n3. The opponent has shown strength by raising\n4. I have a decent stack and don't need to take risks\n\n\n5. My recent play has been very tight and folding weak hands\n\nI'll confidently fold this marginal hand. The mathematical odds and positional disadvantage make continuing with Qh 3c a clear mistake. My tight playing style and stack position support this conservative approach.\n",

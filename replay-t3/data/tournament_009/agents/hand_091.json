I'm in position and can navigate post-flop effectively if called.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have Ah Jc (Ace of hearts, Jack of clubs) on the button. This is a strong hand, especially in position. AJ offsuit is definitely a raising hand from the button.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button (BTN), which is the best position in poker. I get to act last on every street.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 509 chips (15.9 BB). This is a medium stack - not desperate but not deep either.\n\n4. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 is in the big blind with 421 chips (about 13.2 BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They fold preflop frequently (hands 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84, 89, 90)\n   - They sometimes call (hands 76, 86, 88) \n   - When they do see flops, they tend to play passively (check-calling in hand 74, checking in hand 88)\n   - They seem to be a relatively tight/passive player\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: The pot is 48 chips, I need to call 16 to see the flop. That's 3:1 pot odds, which is great for a hand like AJ.\n\n6. **Action**: It's just me (SB) and MiniMax-M2 (BB). The action is on me to complete the small blind.\n\n**Decision**: With AJ on the button against a tight/passive opponent, this is a clear raise. I want to:\n- Build the pot with my strong hand\n- Take control of the hand\n- Put pressure on the BB\n- Potentially win the pot preflop\n\nGiven my stack size (15.9 BB), I should raise to about 2.5-3x the BB. The minimum raise is 64 (2x BB), but that's a bit small. A standard raise would be 80-96 chips (2.5x-3x BB).\n\nLet me raise to 80 chips (2.5x BB). This is a solid sizing that:\n- Puts pressure on the BB\n- Doesn't commit too much of my stack\n- Gives me room to fold if the BB shoves and I don't feel good about it\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the opponent's pattern, they fold to preflop pressure quite often. A raise to 80 (2.5x) should be sufficient.",

Let me analyze the key factors:\n\n**Hand Strength**: 9-2 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker with minimal straight potential (only 8-7-6-5-4-3-A combinations) and no flush potential.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising frequently with varied sizing, and this 80-chip raise (2.5x BB) indicates substantial strength.\n\n**Position & Stack**: I'm in the BB with 13.2 BB stacks, which means I could see a flop cheaply, but this hand rarely makes strong postflop holdings.\n\n**Pot Odds**: While getting 2.33:1 pot odds seems tempting, the hand is too weak to continue against a substantial raise. Even if I hit a pair, it would likely be dominated or beaten by better kickers.\n\nThis is a clear fold situation. I need to preserve my tournament chips for better opportunities rather than chasing with one of the worst possible starting hands.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9d 2s is an extremely weak starting hand with minimal straight potential and no flush potential.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 9d 2s - This is a very weak hand, essentially a \"rag\" hand with little straight or flush potential. It's one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n**Position**: I'm in the BB (Big Blind) position, which means I get to see the flop for \"free\" if I call.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: Looking at Kimi-K2 Thinking's preflop raising patterns:\n- They've been raising frequently (10 raises in recent hands)\n- Their raise sizes have been varied: 16, 24, 24, 24, 24, 48, 48, 48, 96, 64\n- The current raise to 80 chips (2.5x BB) is substantial and indicates strength\n\n**Stack Considerations**: \n- I have 421 chips (13.2 BB)\n- Opponent has 445 chips\n- This is a relatively deep stacked situation\n\n**Pot Odds**: \n- Current pot: 112 chips\n- Amount to call: 48 chips\n- Pot odds: 112/48 = 2.33:1\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. My hand (9d 2s) is extremely weak preflop\n2. The opponent is making a substantial raise, suggesting they have a strong hand\n3. Even though I get to see the flop \"cheaply\" (48 chips to call), this is a very weak hand that rarely makes strong postflop holdings\n4. With 9-2 offsuit, I have very little straight potential (only 8-7-6-5-4-3-A type straights) and no flush potential\n5. Even if I hit a pair, it's likely to be dominated or beaten by better kickers\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak to continue against a substantial raise, even with the pot odds. In tournament poker, especially with a decent stack size, we need to preserve our chips for better spots.\n",

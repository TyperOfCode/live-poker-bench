            "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket 2s in the SB. I need to make a decision about what to do.\n\nFirst, let me analyze the situation:\n- Hand: 2c 2s (pocket deuces) - This is a low pocket pair\n- Position: SB (small blind) - This is one of the worst positions\n- Stack: 192 chips (96 BB)\n- Action: Seat 5 raised to 6 (3x the BB)\n- To call: 5 chips\n- Pot: 9 chips\n\nPocket pairs like 2s are speculative hands. They have value because:\n1. They can flop a set (about 11.8% chance or ~1 in 8.5 times)\n2. When they hit a set, they often win big pots\n3. They can sometimes win unimproved against high cards\n\nHowever, there are significant drawbacks:\n1. They're vulnerable to overcards on the flop\n2. From SB, I'll be out of position post-flop\n3. I'll be heads-up against a raiser who has shown aggression\n\nLet me think about what I learned from the opponent's history:\n- GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop 3 times in the past (hands 1, 2, and 6)\n- Raises were 6, 8, and 6 chips\n- This suggests they play relatively aggressively preflop\n\nThe key question is: Do I have the implied odds to call?\n\nTo call: 5 chips\nCurrent pot: 9 chips\nPot odds: 5/9 = 55.5%\n\nFor set mining, I want to see if I can win enough when I hit to justify the call. The rule of thumb is that I need to be able to win at least 10-15x the amount I call when I hit a set.\n\nI need to win approximately: 5 x 12 = 60 chips when I hit\n\nIf I call 5, the pot will be 14 chips. I would need to win about 4.3x the pot size when I hit. \n\nI have 192 chips, which is deep enough. The raiser has 289 chips, also deep. Both players have enough chips to pay me off.\n\nHowever, the problems are:\n1. I'm out of position - this makes it harder to extract value\n2. Low pocket pairs are hard to play out of position\n3. If I don't hit (which is 7 out of 8 times), I'll often have to fold to continuation bets\n\nGiven that I'm in the SB and will be out of position, and pocket 2s are the smallest pair, I think this is a fold. The combination of poor position and low pair strength makes this a marginal spot at best.\n\nIf I were in position or had a bigger pocket pair, I'd be more inclined to call. But from SB with 2s, I think folding is the best play.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 96 BB stacks, set mining can be profitable. But the position disadvantage is significant. I think I'll fold and wait for a better spot.",

Opponent tendencies: Looking at the data:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown some aggression (bet and raise on flop in hand 9)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Raised to 6 in hand 7 from some position\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Called and raised in hand 9\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has called and shown down decent hands (AJ, JT)\n4. Tournament considerations: With 64 BB, I can afford to be patient and wait for better spots.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 to win 3 (pot is 3). That's 1.5:1 odds, but with a weak hand out of position, this is not good.\n\nGiven that I'm UTG with A3o, and there are 4 players left to act behind me (including the big blind), this is an easy fold.

Consider stack sizes: we have 289, opponent 196. Pot 13. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to 4 total? Actually raise_to is total amount. Minimum raise is 4, meaning we need to put total 4 chips? But we already have 6 in pot? Actually we are acting after flop check, no bet. So to bet, we need to raise to at least 4 chips total (i.e., bet 4). That's a small bet relative to pot (13). Might be okay as a continuation bet to build pot and apply pressure. Opponent is unknown but earlier folds many times, raised once preflop (hand unknown). Could be tight? Not much data. With open-ended straight draw, a bet of around half pot (~6-7) could be good. Minimum raise is 4, we can raise to 8 maybe? But must be at least 4. Our stack is deep, can bet larger. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. No bet action; raise acts as bet. So we could raise to 8 (i.e., bet 8). Pot 13, bet 8 = ~0.6 pot. That seems decent. Opponent may call with overpairs (9, 6, 5) or draws. Our equity vs random hand is about 30%? Actually with open-ended straight draw, about 31% to hit by river, plus some equity now. Might be okay to bet.\n\nConsider tournament: we have 144 BB, deep. No need to preserve chips heavily. So we can be aggressive.\n\nThus choose raise to 8.

            "content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation:\n\nWe are BTN with Td Qd. Board: 5s 6d 9c 7d. So we have an open-ended straight draw? Let's see: we have 8 and 10? Actually we have T and Q, board 5-6-7-9. Our hand: Td gives us 10, Qd gives us queen. With board 5-6-7-9, we have straight draw: need 8 to make 5-6-7-8-9 straight, or we have 10 gives us 6-7-8-9-10? Wait we don't have 8. We have 10 and queen. The board has 5,6,7,9. So we have 10, queen, plus board 5,6,7,9. Straight possibilities: 6-7-8-9-10 would need 8; 5-6-7-8-9 would need 8; also we have gutshot? Actually we have 10, queen, board 5,6,7,9. We have a gutshot draw to a straight? Let's enumerate combos: If a 8 appears, we have 5-6-7-8-9 straight (8 on board). If a Jack appears, we have 6-7-8-9-10? Wait we need 8 for that straight, not J. Actually 6-7-8-9-10 requires 8. So only 8 completes straight. Also a 8 would give us straight; also a queen? Already have queen; queen doesn't help. So we have an open-ended straight draw? Actually we have 5-6-7-9, we have 10, so we have 6-7-8-9-10 missing 8; we also have 5-6-7-8-9 missing 8. So yes we have a gutshot? No, it's an open-ended? Let's think: The straight draw is \"inside\" because only 8 works, not 4 or J. So it's a gutshot (inside) draw: need exactly one rank (8). So probability of hitting on river: 4 outs (four 8s) out of unseen cards. Unknown cards: total deck 52, we have 2, board 4 =6 known. Opponent unknown cards 2? Actually opponent has 2 unknown. So 52-6=46 unknown, 4 outs => ~8.7% chance.\n\nWe also have backdoor flush draw? Board has two diamonds: 6d,7d, our hand has Td Qd both diamonds, so we have a flush draw? Actually we have two diamonds in hand, board has two diamonds, so we have four diamonds total. Need one more diamond on river to make flush. So we have 9 diamonds total in deck (13 total diamonds - 4 we know =9). Opponent may have some diamonds but we consider unknown. So flush draw outs: 9 - opponent's possible diamonds (maybe 0-2). Approx 9 outs, ~19.5% chance.\n\nThus we have combined outs: straight 4, flush 9 (some overlap? 8 of diamonds also counts as straight? 8d is both straight and flush, counted twice. So total unique outs = 4 (8s) + 9 (diamonds) - 1 (8d) =12 outs. So about 12/46 = 26% chance to improve to strong hand.\n\nCurrent pot: 29 chips.

Wait blinds: seat1 posted sb 1, seat2 posted bb 2, we raised 6 (so total 6). Opponent called 4? Actually they call 4 to match our raise to 6 (since they already have 2 blind). So they put 4 more, making total 6 each? Let's compute: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, we raise to 6 (so we put 6 total, net +5). Opponent calls 4 (makes total 6). So pot after preflop = 1+2+6+6 =15? Wait SB 1 + BB 2 + our 6 + opponent 6 =15. Then flop bet 8 from us, opponent calls 8, adding 16 to pot, total pot"

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation:\n\nWe are BTN with Td Qd. Board: 5s 6d 9c 7d. So we have an open-ended straight draw? Let's see: we have 8 and 10? Actually we have T and Q, board 5-6-7-9. Our hand: Td gives us 10, Qd gives us queen. With board 5-6-7-9, we have straight draw: need 8 to make 5-6-7-8-9 straight, or we have 10 gives us 6-7-8-9-10? Wait we don't have 8. We have 10 and queen. The board has 5,6,7,9. So we have 10, queen, plus board 5,6,7,9. Straight possibilities: 6-7-8-9-10 would need 8; 5-6-7-8-9 would need 8; also we have gutshot? Actually we have 10, queen, board 5,6,7,9. We have a gutshot draw to a straight? Let's enumerate combos: If a 8 appears, we have 5-6-7-8-9 straight (8 on board). If a Jack appears, we have 6-7-8-9-10? Wait we need 8 for that straight, not J. Actually 6-7-8-9-10 requires 8. So only 8 completes straight. Also a 8 would give us straight; also a queen? Already have queen; queen doesn't help. So we have an open-ended straight draw? Actually we have 5-6-7-9, we have 10, so we have 6-7-8-9-10 missing 8; we also have 5-6-7-8-9 missing 8. So yes we have a gutshot? No, it's an open-ended? Let's think: The straight draw is \"inside\" because only 8 works, not 4 or J. So it's a gutshot (inside) draw: need exactly one rank (8). So probability of hitting on river: 4 outs (four 8s) out of unseen cards. Unknown cards: total deck 52, we have 2, board 4 =6 known. Opponent unknown cards 2? Actually opponent has 2 unknown. So 52-6=46 unknown, 4 outs => ~8.7% chance.\n\nWe also have backdoor flush draw? Board has two diamonds: 6d,7d, our hand has Td Qd both diamonds, so we have a flush draw? Actually we have two diamonds in hand, board has two diamonds, so we have four diamonds total. Need one more diamond on river to make flush. So we have 9 diamonds total in deck (13 total diamonds - 4 we know =9). Opponent may have some diamonds but we consider unknown. So flush draw outs: 9 - opponent's possible diamonds (maybe 0-2). Approx 9 outs, ~19.5% chance.\n\nThus we have combined outs: straight 4, flush 9 (some overlap? 8 of diamonds also counts as straight? 8d is both straight and flush, counted twice. So total unique outs = 4 (8s) + 9 (diamonds) - 1 (8d) =12 outs. So about 12/46 = 26% chance to improve to strong hand.\n\nCurrent pot: 29 chips. No bet on turn yet; opponent checked, we have option to check or raise.\n\nOpponent: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) with 188 chips, checked turn after we bet flop. We bet 8 on flop, opponent called 8. So pot after flop bet: Preflop pot: we raised to 6, opponent called 4? Actually preflop: we raised 6 (so we put 6, opponent called 4? Wait blinds: seat1 posted sb 1, seat2 posted bb 2, we raised 6 (so total 6). Opponent called 4? Actually they call 4 to match our raise to 6 (since they already have 2 blind). So they put 4 more, making total 6 each? Let's compute: Preflop: SB 1, BB 2, we raise to 6 (so we put 6 total, net +5). Opponent calls 4 (makes total 6). So pot after preflop = 1+2+6+6 =15? Wait SB 1 + BB 2 + our 6 + opponent 6 =15. Then flop bet 8 from us, opponent calls 8, adding 16 to pot, total pot",

            "reasoning_content": "We have opponent's past actions: mostly folds preflop. One raise preflop in hand 7. Not much info. No data about postflop aggression.\n\nGiven our hand has decent equity (~26% to improve) and pot is 29, we could consider a semi-bluff raise to charge draws and build pot if we hit. Opponent checked turn; maybe they have weak hand like middle pair or nothing. Our flop bet was 8 into pot of 15? Actually pot after flop bet = 15+8+8=31? Wait earlier pot 15 preflop, flop bet 8 from us, opponent call 8 => adds 16, so pot = 15+16 =31. But the given pot is 29 chips before turn? The prompt says pot 29 chips. Might be slight mismatch due to rounding. We'll trust pot 29.\n\nIf we check, we give free river to opponent; we have chance to improve. If we raise, we could win pot now if opponent folds, or build pot if called.\n\nWhat is opponent's stack? 188 chips, we have 281. Minimum raise is 8 (to 8 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in; we have already put 6 preflop + 8 flop =14. To raise, we need to put at least 8 more? The minimum raise to is 8 (i.e., total bet of 8? Actually amount to call is 0, so raise_to = 8 means we bet 8 chips total? That seems low relative to pot. Probably raise to 8 means we bet 8 chips. So we can bet 8.\n\nGiven pot 29, a bet of 8 is about 0.28 pot, small. Might not be enough to fold out draws. But it's a turn, could be okay.\n\nWe could also check and see river. Since we have ~26% equity and pot 29, expected value of checking: if opponent checks and we get to river, we can bet or check. Might be okay.\n\nBut maybe we should raise to 12 or 14? Minimum raise is 8; we could raise more? The raise_to is total amount; we could raise to any amount above min? Usually you can raise to any amount up to stack. But we need to know allowed raise amounts. Since min raise is 8, we could raise to say 20. But we don't know if allowed. We can choose raise_to 20.\n\nGiven opponent's stack 188, they could call. A raise of 20 would be 20 into 29 pot, ~0.7 pot, decent pressure.\n\nOur hand is a draw, not a made hand; semi-bluff is appropriate. I'd raise to 20 to charge draws and possibly win now.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 20.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

It's offsuit, not connected, and my King is decent but the 7 kicker is weak. In the BB facing a limp from the SB, I have:\n- Position: I'm out of position postflop (BB)\n- Hand strength: Weak - at best I might have a King-high hand\n- Pot odds: I'm getting a free check (no more to call)\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check. Here's why:\n1. My hand is too weak to raise with, especially out of position\n2. MiniMax-M2 is tight but passive - if I raise, they might fold their weaker hands but call with better ones\n3. I have no information about what they limped with - could be anything from weak suited connectors to small pairs to trap hands\n4. I preserve my stack and see a flop for free with a marginal hand\n5. The pot is small (32 chips) and not worth fighting for with K7o OOP\n\nChecking is the standard, optimal play here.",

Even if my King is good now, any Ace, Jack, or pair beats me. The opponent called preflop from SB, so they could have:\n- Any Ace (dominating me)\n- Any Jack\n- Any pocket pair\n- Some spade draws\n- Random hands\n\nGiven that the opponent is passive and I have no hand, no draw, and I'm out of position, I should check and see what they do. If they bet, I'll likely fold. There's no reason to bluff here against a passive player who has shown they can call bets.\n\nI should check and see a free card, hoping to hit a King.",

They called 8 more (so 16 total) and I checked. Pot is 48.\n- Flop: I checked, they bet 16 (1/3 pot)\n\nThis is a small bet. They could be:\n1. C-betting with air\n2. Betting a weak pair\n3. Betting a strong hand like Ax, Jx, or a set\n\n**Pot odds**: 16 to win 48 = 3:1 = 25% equity needed\n\n**My equity**: With K-high, I likely have around 15-20% equity against a typical betting range here. I need to hit a King or runner-runner straight.\n\n**Position**: I'm out of position, which is bad. If I call, I'll have to act first on future streets.\n\n**Stack sizes**: I have 30 BB, which is healthy. Calling 16 chips won't hurt my stack much.\n\n**Decision**: This is a marginal spot. I have some showdown value with my King high, and the opponent's bet is small. However:\n- I'm out of position\n- I only have K-high\n- The board hits many hands\n\n\nI'll fold this hand. The small pot odds don't justify continuing with just King-high against a likely stronger range. The out-of-position disadvantage and limited drawing potential make this an easy fold, preserving my 30 BB stack for better opportunities.",

It's suited connectors with good playability. With queen-ten suited, I have:\n- Straight potential\n- Flush potential \n- Two overcards to many hands\n- Good position postflop\n\nGiven that:\n1. I'm in position (button)\n2. The opponent has been folding a lot (showing tightness)\n3. My hand has decent playability\n4. I have a good stack size (29.3 BB) to play with\n5. The price is right - only 8 chips to call for a chance to win 24 chips\n\nI think calling is the best play here. I get to see a flop in position with a hand that has decent equity and good playability. If I hit something, I can potentially win a bigger pot, and if I miss, I can easily fold to continued aggression.\n\nRaising might be too aggressive since:\n1. My hand isn't premium (not QQ, KK, AA)\n\n\n2. The opponent has shown a tendency to raise when they have a strong hand\n3.

            "reasoning_content": "  I'm in the BTN position with 2c Ts. Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 2c Ts is a very weak hand. It's an offsuit hand with a low card (2) and a mid card (T). This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is the best position post-flop, but this doesn't compensate for the terrible hand strength.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 818 chips (25.6 BB), which is a healthy stack. I shouldn't risk chips with a weak hand.\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**: MiniMax-M2 is in the BB with 112 chips (3.5 BB). Looking at their history:\n   - They fold preflop frequently (hands 86, 89, 90, 91, 92, 98)\n   - When they do play, they tend to be passive (lots of checking, calling small bets)\n   - They called a 213 chip bet on the turn in hand 96, suggesting they can have decent hands\n   - Overall, they seem tight-passive\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 chips to win a pot of 48 chips. That's 3:1 pot odds, which might seem tempting, but with 2c Ts, I'm very likely dominated even if I hit something.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With a 25.6 BB stack, I'm in decent shape. I don't need to take marginal spots. Folding weak hands from the BTN is fine, especially when the BB is short-stacked and might shove.\n\n7. **The BB's stack**: MiniMax-M2 only has 112 chips (3.5 BB). If I call, they could easily shove all-in, and I'd have to fold anyway, losing the 16 chips.\n\nThe only argument for playing this hand would be if the BB is extremely tight and folds to steals often. But looking at their history, while they do fold a lot, they also call sometimes. And with their short stack, they're more likely to defend or shove.\n\nGiven the terrible hand strength, my decent stack size, and the risk of the short-stacked BB shoving, this is a clear fold.",

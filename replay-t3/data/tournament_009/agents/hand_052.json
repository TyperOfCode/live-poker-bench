            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand**: 9c 2s - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected with a gap. This is typically a folding hand in almost all situations.\n\n**Position**: BB (Seat 1) - I'm in the worst position post-flop.\n\n**Stack**: 453 chips (56.6 BB) - Healthy stack, no pressure.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Pot: 24 chips\n- SB posted 4, I posted BB 8, Seat 4 called 8, Seat 5 called 4\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\nSo the action is back to me after Seat 4 called and Seat 5 called. I can check for free.\n\nLet me think about what to do:\n1. **Hand strength**: 9c 2s is trash. Very low equity against any reasonable calling range.\n2. **Pot odds**: I can check for free, so checking gives me infinite pot odds to see the flop.\n3. **Position**: I'll be out of position post-flop, which is bad.\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called from MP with 225 chips (28 BB) - short stack\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called SB with 284 chips (35.5 BB) - also somewhat short\n\nSince I can check for free, I should check. Raising would be terrible with this hand - I'd be building a pot with a weak hand out of position. Folding is possible but unnecessary since checking is free and I have some chance to hit a miracle flop (though very unlikely).\n\nI should check and see the flop. This is a clear check situation.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - with 9-2 offsuit, even checking might not be great because:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. I have very little chance to improve to a strong hand\n3. If I hit a 9, I'll often be dominated by better 9s\n\n\n4. If I hit a 2, same issue\n\nI'll play cautiously and check, hoping for an unexpected favorable flop despite the hand's inherent weaknesses. The free opportunity to see the flop minimizes my risk while preserving a slim chance of improvement.",

The position gives me good postflop playability with this hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Calling with Ace-rag suited from the button position.

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action. Likely we should raise to build pot and protect against draws. Minimum raise is 8 (i.e., raise to 8 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Current bet is 0, so raise to at least 8. We could raise bigger, maybe to 30-40 chips. Consider stack sizes: we have 284, opponent 225 and 453. Pot 24. We want to extract value but also protect from straight draws (8-9-10). Board has J, two 7s. Potential draws: 8-9-10 for straight, also flush draws (two diamonds on board? No, board has 7c,7h,Js (clubs, hearts, spades). No diamond, so flush draws not possible now. Straight draws: any 8-9-10 combos. That's 4*4*4 combos? Actually combos: 8,9,10 any suits. There are 4*4*4=64 combos minus those that include a 7 or J. But okay.\n\nWe have set, want to bet enough to charge draws. Minimum raise 8 (to 8 total). That would be 8 into 24 pot, not enough. We could raise to maybe 30-40. Let's consider opponent seat4's tendencies: unknown. Might be a calling station? Not sure.\n\nWe could also check to see if seat4 might have J or something. But we have set, we want to bet.\n\nThus action: raise. Choose raise_to maybe 40 chips (approx 1.5-2x pot). That would be 40 total, meaning we add 40 chips (since no bet). That leaves us with 244 chips left.\n\nReasoning: strong hand, want value and protect draws.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

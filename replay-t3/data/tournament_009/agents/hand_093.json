With 17.4 BB, my stack is still healthy enough to wait for better spots.

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: 9d 5h - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and with a large gap. It's not a profitable hand to play in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. However, this is preflop action.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 557 chips (17.4 BB), which is getting short-stacked in tournament terms. I need to be careful with my chips.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - I posted the small blind (16 chips)\n   - MiniMax-M2 posted the big blind (32 chips)\n   - I need to call 16 more chips to see the flop\n\n5. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n   - They have been folding a lot preflop (hands 89, 90, 91, 92)\n   - When they do play, they tend to be passive (calling then checking down)\n   - Their showdown history shows they've played some weak hands (53, 5c3s, JdQd)\n   - They seem to be a somewhat loose-passive player\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 48 chips and I need to call 16 chips, giving me 3:1 pot odds. This means I need ~25% equity to break even.\n\n7. **Hand equity**: 9-5 offsuit has very poor equity against any reasonable calling range. Even against a random hand, it only has about 40% equity, and against a typical BB defending range, it's much worse (likely 30% or less).\n\n8. **Tournament considerations**: With 17.4 BB, I'm in the danger zone but not desperate yet. I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips, but this is not a good spot. 9-5 offsuit is a clear fold in most situations, especially when I'm not extremely short-stacked.\n\n9. **Position advantage**: While I have position post-flop, the hand is just too weak to justify calling. Even if I hit a 9 or 5, I'll often be dominated by better kickers.\n\nThe only argument for calling is that MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot, so I might be able to steal the pot post-flop. But with such a weak hand, this is a low-percentage play that risks valuable tournament chips.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. The hand is too weak, my stack is still healthy enough to wait for better spots, and the risk/reward isn't favorable.",

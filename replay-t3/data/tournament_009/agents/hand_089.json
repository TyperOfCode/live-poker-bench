            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: Ts Jd (offsuit)\n- Position: BTN (Button) - excellent position\n- Stack: 461 chips (14.4 BB) - we're getting short but not desperate yet\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nMiniMax-M2 in BB (Seat 4) has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in hands 78, 80, 82, 84\n- Only called twice (hands 86 and 88)\n- In hand 88, they called preflop, then checked down all streets\n- Showdowns show they play premium hands (pocket pairs, broadway cards)\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- JTo is a marginal hand, but it's a decent button hand\n- We have 14.4 BB which is getting into push/fold territory\n- From the button, this is definitely a playable hand\n- We could raise to steal the blinds or just call and see a flop\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Calling 16 to win 48 = 3:1 pot odds (25% equity needed)\n- JTo likely has enough equity against a random BB hand\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- We have 14.4 BB, which is short but not critical\n- The BB is tight, so stealing could work\n- If we raise and get called, we need to be prepared to play postflop\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Too tight from the button with this stack size\n2. **Call (16)**: See a flop in position, keep pot small\n3. **Raise (64)**: Try to steal the blinds, but risk 64 chips\n\nGiven that the BB is tight and we're on the button with a marginal but playable hand, I think raising to steal is the best play. However, we need to be careful - a min-raise to 64 commits about 14% of our stack. \n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 14.4 BB, we should be thinking about either:\n- Folding marginal hands\n- Raising to steal\n- Shoving strong hands\n\nJTo from the button is good enough to raise as a steal attempt against a tight BB. A standard raise to 64 (2x BB) should be sufficient. If we get called, we have position and can evaluate the flop.\n\nAlternatively, we could just call and see a flop cheaply, preserving our stack for a better spot.\n\nLet me think about the EV:\n- If we raise to 64 and BB folds (likely given tightness), we win 48 chips\n- If we raise to 64 and BB calls, we have position\n\nI think raising is slightly better than calling here. It gives us fold equity and we don't commit too much of our stack.",

It has no straight potential, poor flush potential, and low pair value.\n\n2. **Opponent analysis**: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been active with both raises and folds recently, showing they can be aggressive but also fold when faced with resistance.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (96:32), but this isn't sufficient to justify calling with such a weak hand.\n\n4. **Stack considerations**: With 14.7 BB, I need to be selective about when I continue, especially from out of position.\n\n5. **My BB history**: I've been folding frequently in BB position (63 folds out of 88 hands), which shows appropriate selectivity.\n\nQ7 offsuit has virtually no potential to improve meaningfully and I'll be playing out of position post-flop. Even with decent pot odds, this hand is too weak to continue against a raise. The risk of being dominated by higher queens or being forced to fold on most boards outweighs the pot odds I'm getting.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q7 offsuit is too weak to continue against a raise, especially playing out of position.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Qd 7c - This is a weak hand. Q7 offsuit is below average and has very little potential. It's not connected well and has poor playability.\n\n2. **My position**: I'm in the Big Blind (BB), which means I've already invested 32 chips into the pot.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised to 64 chips preflop. Looking at their recent history:\n   - They've been quite active with raises and folds\n   - In hand #86 they made a large raise of 96 chips\n   - They seem to be playing a mix of strategies\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 96 chips (after their raise), and I need to call 32 more chips to see the flop. This means I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (96:32).\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: I have 469 chips (14.7 BB), which is a decent stack. My opponent has 413 chips (12.9 BB).\n\n6. **My recent BB performance**: Looking at my BB history, I can see:\n   - I've been folding quite a bit in BB position (63 folds out of 88 hands)\n   - My win rate in BB is about 26%\n   - When I do play from BB, I tend to check/call rather than raise with weaker hands\n\nGiven that:\n- I have a very weak hand (Q7 offsuit)\n- The opponent has shown some aggression with raises\n- I'm getting decent pot odds but my hand has very little potential\n- I'm in a tournament where chip preservation is important\n\nThe correct decision here is to fold. Q7 offsuit is too weak to continue against a raise, especially when I have no positional advantage post-flop. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify calling with such a weak hand that has little potential to improve.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

Q-high is marginal, and the 6 doesn't help much. This is a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions post-flop. I'll be out of position against both opponents.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:** From the recall data, MiniMax-M2:\n   - Folds preflop frequently (hands 65, 69, 70)\n   - Calls sometimes (hands 66, 67)\n   - When they see flops, they can be aggressive (bet 16 on turn in hand 66, called 80 on flop in hand 67)\n   - Overall seems somewhat tight but capable of calling and playing post-flop\n\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 8 chips to win 40 chips, which is 5:1 pot odds. This is attractive, but with Q6o, even these odds don't justify calling given how weak my hand is.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With 28.8 BB, I'm in decent shape. I don't need to gamble with a weak hand from a bad position. Preserving my stack is important.\n\n6. **The call from GPT-OSS-120B:** This suggests they might have something, or they could just be calling with a wide range. But even if they're weak, I'm still out of position against two players with a terrible hand.\n \nThe numbers confirm this is a clear fold. The pot odds and hand strength simply don't justify staying in the hand. I'll lose more chips than I'll gain by calling with such a weak position and poor cards.",

This suggests they might be betting for value when they have something but also checking with weaker hands or as a trap.\n\n**Position & Stack Considerations:**\n- I'm in the Big Blind with 14.8 BB remaining\n- With such a weak hand, I should be looking to minimize losses\n- The opponent checked to me, giving me a free decision\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that I have essentially nothing and this is a free check situation, the optimal play is to check and hope to see a cheap showdown or improve on later streets. Raising with this weak hand would be throwing away chips unnecessarily.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Have 5c 3s on Ts Js 6c board - essentially no hand with no draws.

This gives me:\n- No pairs\n- No straight draws (5-4-3-2-A would need a 4 and 2, or 4-3-2-A-K)\n- No flush draws (I have 5c 3s, only 2 clubs in my hand)\n- Essentially a very weak hand with no draws\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the flop actions, I can see:\n- Mix of betting and checking patterns\n- Recent flop actions show: check (hand 70), bet 80 (hand 67), check (hands 66, 64, 63), bet 80 (hand 62), check (hand 57), bet 8 (hand 55), bet 40 (hand 52), check (hand 48)\n- Preflop: mostly calling small amounts, some folds\n\n**Decision Making:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: With 5c 3s on this board, I have essentially nothing\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, which means I act second on the flop\n3. **Pot Odds**: Since opponent checked, there's no bet to call\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: I have 14.8 BB, so I need to be careful about preserving chips\n \nChecking is the optimal strategy. With zero chance of improving my hand and facing an uncertain opponent action, maintaining chip stack integrity becomes crucial. The lack of meaningful draws or potential combinations makes aggressive play imprudent. Preserving my tournament position takes precedence over speculative moves with such a weak hand.\n\nThe opponent's unpredictable betting pattern suggests caution. Their mixed strategy of checking and betting small amounts indicates a tight, measured approach. Exploiting this requires patience and precise timing, neither of which favors my current hand strength.\n\nI'll continue monitoring their play, looking for patterns that might reveal exploitable tendencies, while recognizing my current weak position limits strategic options.\n",

Let me break down what I know:\n\n**My situation:**\n- Position: BB (Big Blind) - Seat 4\n- Hand: 5c 3s (very weak hand - 5-3 offsuit)\n- Stack: 237 chips (14.8 big blinds)\n- Current pot: 40 chips\n- Board: Ts Js 6c 7c 4h\n\n**The situation:**\nLooking at the board: Ts Js 6c 7c 4h\n- This shows a possible straight (6-7-8-9-10 or 4-5-6-7-8)\n- There are two clubs on board (6c, 7c) but I don't have any clubs\n- The turn and river have both been checked by everyone\n\n**Opponent information:**\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B with 248 chips\n- All other players have folded or have 0 chips\n\n**Betting history:**\n- Preflop: I checked as BB, Seat 5 called\n- Flop: Both checked\n- Turn: Both checked  \n- River: Both checked, so now it's my action\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: I have 5c 3s, which is an extremely weak hand. On this board, I have absolutely nothing - no pair, no straight, no flush, no draw that I could have made.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm acting last on the river, which gives me information about what my opponent might do.\n\n3. **Opponent behavior**: My opponent has checked through the entire hand (flop, turn, river). This suggests they either:\n   - Have a weak hand and are afraid to bet\n   - Have a medium hand and are trying to pot control\n   - Have a strong hand but are trying to trap (less likely given the board)\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 40 chips and it costs me nothing to check (amount to call is 0). \n\nI see this as a straightforward decision. With zero chance of improving my hand and facing a potential trap, the most prudent move is to simply fold. My weak 5-3 offsuit has no value against the potential range of hands my opponent could hold. The safe play is to exit the hand without risking more chips.\n",

We are BTN, after SB and BB posted, it's our turn. Amount to call 16 (BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise by at least 16). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nConsider hand: Ace-4 offsuit, not great. In BTN, can steal blinds often, but our stack is short (16.5 BB). Opponents: Kimi-K2 Thinking (SB) has been raising preflop often? Data shows raise to 24 (i.e., 3BB) in several hands, and one raise to 48 (6BB). That suggests they are aggressive, maybe 3-betting? Actually those are their actions preflop: raise from SB? Wait seat1 is SB, they posted 8, then they raise? The data shows raise amounts 24, 48. That suggests they are raising (maybe 3-betting) after someone else? Not sure. But they are aggressive.\n\nMiniMax-M2 (BB) unknown.\n\nOur stack 264 chips, 16.5 BB. The blinds are 8/16, so effective stacks are shallow. If we call 16, we will be left with 248 chips, still decent. If we raise to 32 (i.e., 2x BB), we are putting 32 total, meaning raise 16 more. That would be a 2BB raise (standard). With Ace-4 offsuit, not strong enough to raise maybe. But stealing from SB and BB might be okay. However SB is aggressive and may 3-bet. Our stack is short, but we could go all-in? Minimum raise to 32 is okay; we could also go all-in (264) but that would be huge relative to pot.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, we might just call and see flop, but calling is like limping; in BTN it's okay but with short stack maybe we want to steal. However Ace-4 offsuit is not great for 3-bet, but could be a steal. But if SB is aggressive and may re-raise, we risk being 3-bet and losing chips. Our stack is 16.5 BB, we can afford a raise.\n\nI think best is to raise to 48 (i.e., 3BB) to apply pressure? But min raise is 32. Raising to 32 is standard. Considering SB's aggressiveness, a raise may be called or re-raised. But we have limited chips; if they 3-bet, we may be forced all-in anyway.\n\nGiven the hand is weak, maybe just call and hope to see cheap flop? But calling 16 invests 1BB; if we miss flop, we can fold later. With short stack, we want to preserve chips; limping is okay.\n\nThus decision: call.\n\nReasoning: Weak hand, short stack, SB aggressive, better to just call and see flop, preserve stack.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on river. Board: T\u2660 J\u2660 6c 7c 4h. Our hand: A\u2665 4\u2660. So we have pair of fours (board has 4h). Actually we have a pair of fours with kicker A. Board: T,J,6,7,4. So we have two pair? No, we have pair of fours, board has no other pair. So we have pair, low. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) checked river. So they likely have weak hand or drawing? Let's consider possible hands: Could have straight? Board: T,J,6,7,4. Straight possible: 8-9? No. 8-9 would need 8 and 9, not present. 9-8? Not. 5-8? Not. So no straight possible. Flush? Board has two clubs (6c,7c) and two spades (Ts,Js). No flush possible with 5 cards? Need 3 clubs or 3 spades among hole+board. Opponent could have two clubs for flush draw but board only has two clubs, need one more club in hand for flush, but they'd need 5 clubs total, not possible (only 2 clubs on board, need 3 in hand, impossible). So no flush. So best possible hand is two pair, trips, or full house. Board: T,J,6,7,4. No pair on board. So opponent could have a pair on board (like T, J, 6, 7) but they need a pocket pair to have pair? Actually they'd need a card matching board rank: e.g., T? they'd have T? That gives them pair of tens with kicker J? Actually they'd have two pair if they have a T and a J? But board has T and J each single. So if opponent holds T and J, they'd have two pair (T,J). That would beat our pair of fours. Also any higher pair like A, K, Q, etc? They could have A? they'd have pair of A's? No board doesn't have A. So they could have a higher pair like A? they'd need A on board, not there. So they'd need a pair in hand (e.g., 9-9) that would be just a pair, but lower than our A kicker? Actually pair 9s would be higher than our pair of fours, because pair of 9s beats pair of 4s. So many possible hands beat us. But opponent checked, maybe they think they are weak. Our hand is weak. So best to check. Could also consider bluff raise? Stack sizes: we have 248 chips, opponent 237. Pot 40. Minimum raise is 16. Raising to 16 would be a small raise (to 16 total? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 16 means we bet 16). That is about 40% of pot. Could be a semi-bluff? But opponent likely has better hand; they'd call and we lose chips. So better to check and fold if they bet later (but they checked). So choose check.\n\nThus output JSON with action check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

K9o UTG is a textbook fold in tournaments. I should only be playing premium hands from this position.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K9o is too weak to play UTG.

Against a typical early position raising range, Q8o has only about 25-30% equity.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm out of position post-flop, which makes it harder to realize my equity even when I hit.\n\n4. **Stack Preservation**: With a healthy 48BB stack, I should be selective about spots where I invest chips without a strong hand.\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: This is not a good spot to gamble with a marginal hand against what appears to be a very strong range.\n\nThe opponent's tight image (10 straight folds) followed by a raise indicates significant strength. Q8o is simply not strong enough to continue here, especially out of position.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Opponent folded 10 hands in a row before this raise, indicating a premium hand.

I'm too deep stacked to shove, and folding gives up too much equity with these odds.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Getting 3.5:1 pot odds with Q9s - a hand with good suited potential.

This suggests they can have a wide range when betting.\n\n3. **Pot Size**: The pot is 70 chips and I only have 117 chips left.

This could indicate:\n   - They had a marginal hand that improved on the turn\n   - They were continuation betting and gave up\n   - They have a monster and are trying to trap\n\nGiven my stack size and the fact that I only have Ace-high, I should check back and see a free river card rather than risk more chips with just Ace-high.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"With only Ace-high and a significant portion of my stack at risk, checking back preserves chips while seeing a free river card.

They've shown down pocket pairs and strong hands, suggesting they raise with a wide range\n2. **My stack**: At 13.1 BBs, I'm in shove-or-fold territory\n3. **Hand strength**: A9o is a decent hand against a wide raising range, especially when I have fold equity\n\n**Decision**: This is a perfect spot for an all-in shove. I have:\n- Fold equity against a frequent raiser\n- A decent hand that plays well against their likely wide range\n- A stack size where shove-or-fold is correct\n- The ace blocker reduces the chance they have a dominant ace\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 105,\n  \"reasoning\": \"All-in shove with A9o against frequent raiser.

When they do play, they show aggression (raised on flop in hand 9). Their small bet sizing (4 chips into 18 chip pot) on both flop and turn suggests either a weak made hand or a draw.\n\n2. **Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**: Also tight but more active - has shown preflop aggression with 6-chip raises. Has folded to the turn bet, indicating weakness.\n\n3. **My situation**: I have bottom pair on a board with two broadway cards and potential flush/straight draws. The bet sizing is small (4 into 18), giving me 5.5:1 pot odds.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: I'm on the BTN with a healthy stack (100+ BB), so I can afford to see cards, but I need to be careful about building big pots with marginal hands.\n\nGiven the small bet size, my pair of 5s might be good here, especially against Seat 4 who appears to be a tight player making small bets. The pot odds are very favorable (5.5:1), and I have position. However, I only have bottom pair and could easily be behind.\n\n**Decision**: Call the small bet and see what happens on the river. If they bet big on the river, I can fold. If they check, I might be able to win with a small bet.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Getting 5.5:1 pot odds with bottom pair.

The hand has no potential to win except by pure bluffing, and calling here would be burning chips.

They called my large flop re-raise and are now betting big on the turn. \n\n**Key considerations**:\n- I have top pair with decent kicker\n- Multiple draws possible (clubs for flush, 7-T for straight)\n- Pot odds are 2.6:1 \n- If I call, I'll have only 48 chips left, essentially pot-committing myself\n- Seat 4's betting pattern shows real strength\n\nWith top pair and given the aggressive action, I think I'm likely behind here. Seat 4 probably has:\n- A set (88, 99, 44)\n- Two pair (K9, K8)\n- Or a strong draw that they're semi-bluffing\n\nGiven that I have only 155 chips and would be pot-committed, this is a tournament decision about survival vs. chip accumulation.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Top pair facing strong action on coordinated board.

I have A\u26669\u2660 - a decent hand, especially short-stacked\n2. I'm getting pot odds of 345:4 (86:1) - I only need to win ~1.2% of the time to break even\n3. I'm already pot-committed with my small stack\n4. Folding would leave me with 0 chips anyway\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Going all-in with A9o for 4 chips into 345 pot, getting 86:1 pot odds.

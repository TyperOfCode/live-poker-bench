            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current hand:**\n- Position: BB (Big Blind)\n- Cards: Jd 4d (Jack of diamonds, 4 of diamonds)\n- Stack: 179 chips (89.5 BB)\n- Pot: 7 chips\n- To call: 2 chips (MiniMax-M2 raised from 2 to 4)\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- J4s (suited) is a marginal hand, especially from BB\n- It's a suited one-gapper (J-4), which has some potential for flushes and occasional straights\n- However, it's a very weak hand overall\n\n**Opponent analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see MiniMax-M2 has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in hands 4-8, 10-15, 17-18 (13 out of 15 hands)\n- Only played hands 9 and 16\n- In hand 9: Called preflop, raised on flop, then folded\n- In hand 16: Called preflop, bet flop and turn, checked river\n\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 is a tight player who only plays strong hands. When they do raise preflop (like now), they likely have a strong hand.\n\n**Position and pot odds:**\n- I'm in BB, which is out of position postflop\n- Pot is 7 chips, I need to call 2 chips\n- Pot odds: 7:2 or 3.5:1\n- This is decent pot odds, but...\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (89.5 BB)\n- J4s is a weak hand, especially out of position\n- Against a tight player who raised, I'm likely dominated\n- Even with suited cards, the reverse implied odds are bad (if I hit a flush, I could lose to a higher flush)\n- The one-gapper straight potential is very unlikely\n\n**Decision:**\nDespite the decent pot odds, this is a clear fold. J4s is too weak to call a raise from a tight player while being out of position. \n\nI'll preserve my chips for better opportunities. The potential flush draw might seem tempting, but the risk of being dominated by a stronger flush makes this an easy decision. Playing out of position with a marginal hand against a tight opponent is a recipe for losing chips.",

Seems tight.\n2. **MiniMax-M2:** Has folded 7 out of 10 hands preflop, called BB once, and showed aggression postflop in one hand.\n3. **GPT-OSS-120B:** Has raised twice preflop, folded 5 times, checked once in BB. Shows some aggression.\n\n**My hand analysis:** K5o is a very weak hand, especially from UTG. It's not suited, not connected, and has reverse implied odds (if I hit a K, I could be dominated by better Kx hands). In early position with this weak hand, standard play is to fold.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** I have 58 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands from early position.\n\n**Position:** Being UTG is terrible for this hand. I have to act first on every street, making it hard to realize equity.\n\n**Potential actions:**\n- **Fold:** Correct with K5o from UTG\n- **Call:** Would put 2 chips in, but then I'm out of position with a weak hand against potentially 3 opponents\n- **Raise:** Would be a bluff, but K5o doesn't have good bluffing properties\n\n**Pot odds:** Need to call 2 to win 5 (current 3 + my 2), so getting 2.5:1. But hand is so weak that pot odds don't justify calling.\n\nGiven all factors, the clear decision is to fold. This hand should not be played from UTG, especially with my stack size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K5o is too weak from UTG position.

It's back to me in the BB.\n\n5. **Opponent info**: MiniMax-M2 has folded all 3 previous hands preflop, showing a tight/passive style so far. They have 195 chips.\n\n6. **Pot**: 5 chips (2 from me as BB, 1 from SB, 2 from MiniMax-M2's call)\n\n7. **Legal actions**: I can fold (terrible with AQ), check (free flop), or raise (minimum to 4 total).\n\nWith AQ suited in the BB against a single caller who has shown tight tendencies, I should definitely raise here. My hand is very strong and I want to:\n- Extract value from weaker hands\n- Build the pot when I likely have the best hand\n- Take initiative in position (though I'll be out of position post-flop)\n\nSince I can check for free, many players might do that, but with AQ suited against a tight opponent who just limped in, raising is the better play. I want to isolate this opponent and build the pot.\n\nMinimum raise is to 4 chips (2 more chips). This is a standard 3x the limp raise. Given the opponent's tight nature, they may fold, but that's fine - I win the pot uncontested. If they call, I'll be in position to make post-flop decisions.\n\nLet me raise to 4 chips total.",

In early position, this should typically be folded. Looking at my stack: 189 chips (94.5 BB), so I have a healthy stack.\n\nFrom the hand history, I can see:\n- Hand #1: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 6 from SB when action folded to them\n- Hand #2: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 8 from UTG+1\n- GPT-OSS-120B seems to be aggressive preflop\n\nI'm UTG with 4 players left to act behind me (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, and the blinds). K2o is a terrible hand to open with from UTG. The pot is 3 chips, and I need to call 2 to see the flop.\n\nPot odds: 2 to win 5 (pot of 3 + my call of 2) = 2:5 = 1:2.5 = 40% equity needed. My hand likely has less than 20% equity against random hands, and even less against the ranges of players who might call or raise behind me.\n\nGiven my early position and weak hand, folding is clearly correct. I shouldn't be playing K2o from UTG. I need to preserve my stack and wait for better spots.\n\nLet me check if there are any other considerations: I have 94.5 BB, so no pressure to play marginal hands. The tournament is still early. Better to fold and wait for a better position/hand.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

This gives me good odds to pursue potential draws.\n\n**Tournament Context**: With 98.5 BB stack, I have room to play speculative hands.

This gives me more information and control.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 197 chips (98.5 BB) - I'm at about 100BB, which is a comfortable stack depth for standard poker play.\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis**:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown a tendency to call down with pocket 8s (from the hand history), and has been folding some hands preflop\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been quite aggressive, raising preflop in both previous hands and betting on multiple streets\n\n5. **Situation**: \n   - I'm facing a call of 2 chips to stay in\n   - The small blind (Seat 5) posted 1 chip\n   - The big blind (Seat 1) posted 2 chips\n   - Two players folded before me (Seats 2 and 3)\n   - Minimum raise would be to 4 chips total\n\n6. **Considerations**:\n   - With 6d 8c, I'm getting decent pot odds (3 chips already in pot, need to call 2 to see flop)\n   - I'm in position, which is valuable with speculative hands\n   - This is a suited connector that can make straights and flushes\n   - If I hit a draw or made hand, I can potentially get value from the aggressive Seat 5\n   - However, 6d 8c is quite weak and has low equity against most ranges\n\n7. **Tournament Considerations**: \n   - This is early in the tournament (Hand #4)\n   - Stack preservation is important, but I have a comfortable stack\n   - I need to be selective but can't be too tight\n   \nThe pot odds are attractive, and my positional advantage makes this a borderline call. With speculative potential and decent implied odds, I'll proceed by calling to see the flop, keeping my options open for potential draws or hidden value.\n",

With pot odds of 7:2 (3.5:1), I need about 22% equity to make a profitable call. 6-8 offsuit simply doesn't have enough equity against a reasonable raising range.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: Early in the tournament with a healthy stack, I should preserve chips and wait for better opportunities rather than chasing with marginal holdings.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold.

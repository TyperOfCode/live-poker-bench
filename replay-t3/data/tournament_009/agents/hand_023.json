Q2o is one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n**Position:** UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table. I act first preflop and will be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n**Stack:** 298 chips (74.5 BB) - This is a healthy stack, no need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies from Recent Hands:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) just went all-in with 110 chips in hand #22 and everyone folded. They seem to be getting aggressive, possibly due to their short stack (only 2 chips left now).\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) posted SB and has been folding a lot recently.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) posted BB and has mixed between folding and raising.\n- The other Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been folding frequently.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 is down to just 2 chips, so they're in desperation mode.\n- I have a healthy stack and should preserve it.\n- From UTG position, I need to play very tight.\n\n**Pot Odds:** Need to call 4 chips to win 6 chips = 1.5:1. This is not relevant since my hand is so weak.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. Q2o from UTG is a trash hand. I should:\n1. Preserve my healthy stack\n2. Wait for better spots\n3. Avoid playing out of position with weak hands\n4. Let the short stack (DeepSeek-V3.2) potentially bust out\n\nI should fold immediately.",

This is a marginal hand at best, especially when facing aggression.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: \n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been very passive recently, folding to several preflop raises in recent hands (17-22)\n- In the one showdown I can see, they had 5c 4h and played conservatively\n- They seem to be playing a tight, passive style\n\n**Stack & Tournament Considerations**: \n- I have 193 chips (48.2 BB), which is a healthy stack\n- No need to take marginal risks when I have plenty of chips to work with\n- Better opportunities will likely arise later\n\n**Pot Odds**: While I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (20 chips in pot, need to call 10), the hand strength and position disadvantages outweigh these odds.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. My hand is too weak to play out of position against a raise, especially when I have a tight image and can afford to wait for a better spot. Suited connectors like 6h 8h need to see cheap flops and have positional advantage to be profitable.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"6h 8h is too weak to play out of position against a raise.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n1. **My Hand Analysis**: I have 6h 8h, which is a weak suited connector. This is not a premium hand by any means, and it's generally considered a marginal hand, especially out of position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the Small Blind (SB), which is one of the worst positions in poker. I'm out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 193 chips (48.2 BB), which is a healthy stack. This gives me room to play, but I should still be somewhat selective.\n\n4. **Current Action**: \n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 chips preflop\n   - Seat 3 called 2 chips (but they're out of the tournament now)\n   - The amount I need to call is 10 chips (since I already posted 2 for SB)\n\n5. **Opponent Analysis**:\n   - **Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**: Looking at their recent history, they've been quite passive. They've folded to several preflop raises recently (hands 17-22), and in the one hand they played to showdown (hand 16), they had 5c 4h and called some bets but ultimately lost to a better hand. They seem to be playing tight and passive.\n   \n   - **Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)**: This player has been more active with several raises and bets. They've shown willingness to play hands and bet for value. They have 308 chips, making them a bigger stack.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: The pot is currently 20 chips, and I need to call 10 to continue. This gives me 3:1 pot odds.\n\n7. **Hand Strength**: 6h 8h is a weak hand, especially out of position. Suited connectors like this have potential when they hit big (straights, flushes, two pair), but the probability is low, and being out of position makes it even more difficult to realize that potential.\n   \nThe tournament context demands a cautious approach. With my marginal hand and challenging position, folding seems the most prudent strategy. The tight, passive opponent and my weak suited connectors suggest minimal winning potential. Preserving my chip stack takes precedence over chasing unlikely draws in this scenario.\n\n8. **Tournament Considerations**: I'm at 48.2 BB, which is a comfortable stack. I don't need to take marginal risks to stay alive. Better opportunities will likely arise later in the tournament.\n\n9. **Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. My hand is too weak to play out of position against a raise, especially when I have a tight image and can wait for a better spot.",

So raise to 12 means total bet 12, we need call 8 (since we already have 4 in BB? Actually SB posted 2, then BB posted 4. Wait: SB is seat5, posted SB 2, then BB posted 4. So the raise to 12 is from seat2, meaning they raised to 12 total. Our contribution is 2 (SB) + we haven't posted BB (since we are SB). Actually we are SB, so we posted 2. The BB posted 4. So the raise to 12 is from seat2, we need to call additional 10? Let's compute: current pot includes SB 2, BB 4, raise to 12 from seat2 (so they put 12). So total contributions: SB 2, BB 4, seat2 12 = 18. Our amount to call is 12 - 2 = 10? But the prompt says amount to call: 8. So maybe they consider that we are the BB? Wait seat5 is SB, seat5 posted SB 2, seat5 also posted BB 4? That seems weird. Actually the actions: preflop: Seat 4 post_sb 2 (that's seat4, but seat4 is MiniMax-M2 folded later). Then preflop: Seat 5 post_bb 4. So seat4 posted SB 2, seat5 posted BB 4. So we are BB, not SB. The Position line says SB (Seat5) but the actions indicate seat5 is BB. There's inconsistency. Probably position is SB, seat5 posted BB incorrectly. But amount to call is 8, min raise 20. So we need to call 8 to match raise to 12 (since we have 4 in pot as BB). So we have Kd8d, a weak hand. Opponent seat2 raised to 12 from UTG? Not sure.\n\nWe need to decide: fold, call, raise. K8 suited is not strong enough for a 3-bet in early position against unknown. Stack 308, we have 77 BB, deep. Likely fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: seat2 has been folding preflop in last 5 hands. So maybe they are tight. But they raised now. Could be strong. K8 suited is marginal. I'd fold.\n\nThus output JSON.",

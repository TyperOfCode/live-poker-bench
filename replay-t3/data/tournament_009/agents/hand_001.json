Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My hand: 8d Qh (offsuit, middle strength)\n- Position: BTN (Button) - this is excellent position\n- Stack: 200 chips (100 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot: 9 chips\n- Facing a raise to 6 from GPT-OSS-120B in late position (seat 5)\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Q8o is a marginal hand. It's not strong enough to call a raise with typically, especially from early position in a full ring game. However, I'm on the button which gives me position advantage.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is huge. I'll act last post-flop, which gives me information advantage and control over the pot.\n\n3. **Opponent**: I have no history on GPT-OSS-120B. The raise to 6 (3x BB) is a standard opening size.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 6 to win 9, so getting 1.5:1 immediate odds. This is not enough direct odds for Q8o.\n\n5. **Implied odds**: With position and a healthy stack, I have some implied odds if I hit a strong hand. Q8 can make straights (T-9-J-Q-K, 9-T-J-Q, etc.) and two pairs.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: It's early, I have a full stack. I should be somewhat selective but can take some speculative calls in position.\n\n**Decision**: I think this is a fold. Q8o is just too weak to call a raise with, even with position. If I had something like suited connectors or a stronger offsuit hand like QJ or KT, I'd consider calling. But Q8o is dominated by many hands that would raise (AQ, KQ, QJ, QT).\n\nLet me reconsider - maybe I can call given the position advantage? The raise is only 3x, and I'm getting decent implied odds with position. However, I think the standard play here is to fold marginal hands like Q8o to a raise, even on the button. I want to avoid difficult post-flop situations with a weak hand.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully. The raise is to 6, which is 3x the BB. This is a relatively small raise. With position, calling might be acceptable to see a flop. But Q8o is really at the bottom of my calling range here. I think the disciplined play is to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nFinal decision: **FOLD**",

The blinds are 1/2.\n\nI think calling is reasonable. A4s in position against a cutoff raise is playable. Pot odds are good. I'll call.\n\nSo my response should be:\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A4s in position with good pot odds (3.25:1). Calling to see flop with position advantage against cutoff raise.\"\n}\n\nWait, but actually I'm in the BB, not button. Let me re-read: \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\". It says BTN. But the actions show: Seat 2 post_sb 1, Seat 3 post_bb 2. That means I'm actually the big blind, not button. The button is seat 3? Actually BTN means button. So I'm the button, but I posted BB? That seems inconsistent. Let me check: \"Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 198 chips\" and \"Your Position: BTN (Seat 3)\". So I'm seat 3, which is button. But the actions show \"Seat 3 post_bb 2\". That means button posted big blind? That's unusual. Maybe it's a tournament with antes or something? Actually blinds are 1/2. SB is seat 2, BB is seat 3. So button is in BB position this hand. That means I'm out of position postflop. That changes things.\n\nIf I'm in the BB, I'm out of position. That makes A4s weaker. But I'm getting a good price: need to call 4 into pot of 9. That's still 2.25:1 pot odds (9:4). Actually pot is 9 (SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 6). I need to call 4 more. So total pot after my call would be 13. My pot odds are 4 to win 9+4=13, so 13:4 = 3.25:1, which is 23.5% equity needed.\n\nA4s against a typical cutoff raising range has about 30% equity. So pot odds are okay. But being out of position reduces implied odds. However, we're both deep (99 BB effective).\n\nI think calling is still okay given the price. Folding might be too tight. Raising could be an option as a 3-bet bluff, but with A4s I'd rather not 3-bet out of position.\n\nI'll stick with call.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with A4 offsuit. The flop is Td 5d 7h rainbow except for two diamonds. I have a backdoor flush draw with the A\u2666, but otherwise my hand is weak - just Ace high with no pair. The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) raised preflop from the cutoff to 6 chips (3x BB), and I called from the big blind.\n\nNow the flop comes, and it's my action first since the preflop raiser is in position. The pot is 13 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise + 4 call = 13). I have 194 chips left.\n\nI need to decide what to do. My hand is weak - Ace high with a backdoor flush draw and backdoor straight possibilities (though unlikely with A4). The board is fairly dry with T-5-7 rainbow. The preflop raiser could have a wide range here since it's just heads-up.\n\nGiven that I'm out of position and have a weak hand, I should consider checking and seeing what the opponent does. If I check and he bets, I'll have to decide whether to continue. With Ace high and a backdoor flush draw, I might have some equity, but not much.\n\nPot odds: If I check and he bets, say half pot (6-7 chips), I'd be getting about 3:1 odds. My equity against a range of pairs, Broadway cards, etc. is probably around 25-30% at best. But with just Ace high, I'd likely need to improve to win.\n\nAlternative: I could lead out with a small bet to try to take the pot down now. A bet of 4-5 chips (30-40% pot) might get folds from hands like KQ, QJ, or smaller pocket pairs. But if he raises, I'm in a tough spot.\n\nGiven that I have no information on this opponent (no history found), and this appears to be early in the tournament, I should play somewhat cautiously. Checking seems reasonable to see what the opponent does.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 97 BB, so I'm deep. No need to take big risks with marginal hands. But also, being on the button gives me some positional advantage in future streets, though I'm actually out of position in this hand since I called from BB.\n\nActually wait - I'm on the button, but I was the big blind. So I'm actually out of position for this hand. The opponent is in position.\n\nGiven all this, I think checking is the best play. If the opponent checks behind, I get a free card to potentially improve. If he bets, I can evaluate based on bet size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Weak hand with only Ace high and backdoor flush draw.

Actually, with A4 on T-5-7 board, I have a gutshot to a 6 (making 4-5-6-7 straight). Weak hand overall.\n\n2. **Board texture:** T\u2666 5\u2666 7\u2665 - fairly dry board except for diamond flush draw. My A\u2660 is not a diamond, so I only have one diamond (4\u2666). The board doesn't connect well with typical raising ranges.\n\n3. **Opponent's range:** Seat 5 raised from late position (CO or BTN? Actually Seat 5 is after folded seats, so likely late position). Range could be wide. The small 4-chip bet on flop (23.5% pot) could be a continuation bet with a wide range, trying to take it down with any two cards.\n\n4. **Pot odds:** Pot is 17 + 4 = 21 chips. Need to call 4 chips. That's 4:21 or about 1:5.25 pot odds (19% equity needed). \n\n5. **My equity:** Against a reasonable range (pairs, broadways, suited connectors), I estimate I have around 25-30% equity with my A-high + backdoor draws. The gutshot gives me 4 outs (6s), and the backdoor flush draw adds some equity. Aces might be good sometimes if opponent has complete air.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** I have 97 BB stack, healthy. Folding loses nothing. Calling keeps me in the hand with position (I act last on future streets).\n\n7. **Position advantage:** I'm on the BTN, which is great position. I get to see opponent's turn action before I act.\n\n8. **Bet sizing tells:** The small bet (4 into 17) looks like a probe or weak continuation bet. Could be trying to get a cheap look at turn or thin value with medium strength.\n\nGiven the pot odds (19% needed), my estimated equity (25-30%), position advantage, and the small bet size suggesting weakness, I should call. Raising might be an option to take it down now, but with my weak hand and backdoor draws, I prefer to call and reassess on turn.\n\nHowever, let me think about the gutshot more carefully: I need a 6. There are 4 sixes in the deck. That's about 8% equity just from the straight. Backdoor flush draw adds maybe 4% more. Ace might be good sometimes. So maybe 15-20% equity total. Still, with 19% needed, it's close.\n\nActually, the pot odds calculation: 4 to win 25 (21 current + my 4 call) = 16% equity needed. Wait, recalc: Pot before bet: 17. Opponent bets 4, making pot 21.

I need to decide: fold, call, or raise.\n\nI analyzed earlier and concluded calling is marginal but okay due to pot odds (16% equity needed), position, and backdoor draws. Let me confirm the numbers.\n\nPot is 17, opponent bet 4 making pot 21. I need to call 4 to win 25 total (21+4). That's 4/25 = 16% equity needed.\n\nMy hand: A4o, board Td 5d 7h. I have A-high, backdoor flush draw with 4d, gutshot straight draw (need a 6). That's 4 outs to a straight = ~8% equity. Backdoor flush draw adds maybe 4%. Ace might be good sometimes. Total maybe 15-20%. It's close.\n\nPosition is good (BTN). Opponent's small bet (23% pot) could be weak. Could be a probe or c-bet with air.\n\nTournament: I have 97 BB, healthy stack. Folding is fine too.\n\nI think calling is reasonable. I'll go with call.\n\nNeed to output JSON: action: \"call\", raise_to: null, reasoning: brief explanation.\n\nLet me craft the reasoning: \"Pot odds require 16% equity.

I have Ace high with backdoor flush potential (4d gives me a diamond, but board has two diamonds already). Actually, I have 4d, board has Td and 7h, Js, 5d. So there are two diamonds on board (Td, 5d). I have 4d, so I have a flush draw with one more diamond. That's actually a flush draw! Wait, I have 4d, board has Td and 5d. That's three diamonds total. I need two more diamonds for a flush. Actually, a flush requires 5 cards of same suit. I have one diamond, board has two diamonds, so I need two more diamonds on turn and river. That's not a flush draw yet - I need runner-runner diamonds.\n\nBut I also have a gutshot straight draw: board is T-5-7-J. I need a 9 for a straight (8-9-T-J-Q? Wait, let's check: board T-5-7-J. For a straight, I could have 8-9 for a straight? Actually, with A4, possible straights: if a 3 comes, I have A-4-5-? Actually 3 would give me A-2-3-4-5? No, I have A4. Board T-5-7-J. Not many straight possibilities. Maybe if a 6 comes, I'd have 4-5-6-7? That's only 4 cards. Not a straight.\n\nMy hand is weak: Ace high with weak kicker. I have position (BTN) and opponent is in Seat 5 (must be CO or BTN? Actually seats: 1 folded, 2 folded (SB), 3 is me (BB), 4 folded, 5 raised preflop. So opponent is in early position? Actually seat 5 is after me? Wait, seating: 1, 2, 3 (me), 4, 5. So opponent in seat 5 acted after me preflop. That means they raised from late position, maybe CO or BTN? Actually I was BB, so seat 5 is either BTN or CO depending on table size. Anyway, they raised preflop, I called from BB with A4o.\n\nFlop: Td 5d 7h. I checked, they bet 4 into pot of ~13? Let's calculate: preflop pot: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6, I called 4 more. So pot preflop: 1+2+6+4=13? Actually SB folded, so only 1 from SB, 2 from BB, 6 from raiser, 4 from my call = 13. Flop: they bet 4, I called 4, pot now 21.\n\nTurn: Js. No flush yet. I have nothing but Ace high. I'm getting 21:0 odds to check (no bet). I could check and see what opponent does. They might bet again with a wide range since they raised preflop and bet flop. They could have a pair, a draw, or air.\n\nMy stack: 190 chips (95 BB). Opponent has 190 chips. Pot is 21. Not huge.\n\nGiven my weak hand and only Ace high, I should probably check and fold to a bet unless I get good odds. But I have position - I can check and see what they do. If they check behind, I get a free river. If they bet, I need to evaluate.\n\nActually, I have the option to bet as a bluff. But with Ace high on a board with T-5-7-J, there are many draws (flush draw, straight draws). My hand has some showdown value if checked through, but not much.\n\nBetter to check and see what opponent does. If they bet small, maybe I call if I think they're bluffing and I have some equity with Ace high. But realistically, I'm probably behind.\n\nLet me think about opponent's range: They raised preflop from late position, could be wide. They bet flop on Td 5d 7h, could be continuation bet. Turn Js might hit some of their range (JJ, AJ, KJ, QJ, JT). Also flush draws.\n\nMy hand blocks some Ax hands that might bluff.\n\nGiven I have no history on opponent, and it's early in tournament, I should play cautiously. Check and evaluate.\n\nDecision: check."

Amount to call is 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. They need to output a JSON object with action, raise_to, reasoning.\n\nI need to think about the hand. I have A4o, Ace high with weak kicker. Board has two diamonds, I have 4d giving me a backdoor flush draw (need two more diamonds). Also board T-5-7-J, not much straight potential for my hand. I have position, opponent raised preflop from seat 5 (late position) and bet flop. Turn brought Js, no flush. Pot is 21, no bet to call. I can check, raise, or fold. Folding seems too weak when I can check for free. Raising could be a bluff, but with Ace high and no strong draw, probably not good. Checking seems standard to see what opponent does on river, maybe bluff catch if they check behind or bet small.\n\nBut wait, I have position, I'm last to act. Actually, on turn, opponent acted first? Let's see: preflop: seat 5 raised, I called. Flop: I checked, seat 5 bet, I called. Turn: board shown, now it's my action? Actually, the hand description says \"=== Hand #1 - TURN ===\" and shows board, then \"Amount to call: 0\". That suggests it's my turn to act, and opponent has not acted yet? But in Texas Hold'em, after flop, the action continues with the first player still in hand left of the dealer. I'm BTN (seat 3), opponent is seat 5. Typically, the order would be: after flop, first to act is the player left of the dealer. I'm BTN, so opponent in seat 5 might be first to act? Actually, need to consider positions. Seats: 1, 2, 3 (me BTN), 4, 5. Blinds: seat 2 posted SB, seat 3 (me) posted BB. Preflop: seat 4 folded, seat 5 raised, seat 1 folded, seat 2 folded, I called. So there are two players: me (BB) and seat 5 (raiser). On flop, first to act is the player left of the dealer? Actually, the dealer button is at seat 3 (me). So the small blind (seat 2) would act first, but they folded. So the first to act postflop is the next player after the dealer, which is seat 4, but they folded. Then seat 5, then me. So seat 5 acts first postflop. On flop, I checked, seat 5 bet, I called. On turn, the action should start with seat 5 again. But the interface says \"Amount to call: 0\" and legal actions for me. That suggests it's my turn to act, meaning seat 5 has already acted and checked? Or maybe the interface is showing that it's my turn because I'm the user? Wait, the description might be that the turn card is dealt, and now it's my action because I'm the user and the opponent has not acted yet? Actually, typical poker interface: after turn card, the first player to act is the one left of the dealer. That would be seat 5. But maybe the system is waiting for my action because I'm the user and the opponent's action is simulated after mine? Or maybe the opponent has already checked? The \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests there is no bet to call, meaning opponent has checked. Because if opponent had bet, amount to call would be >0. So opponent must have checked. That makes sense: on turn, opponent checked, and now it's my action with option to check, raise, or fold.\n\nThus, opponent checked the turn. That's interesting. They raised preflop, bet flop, then checked turn. Could be weakness, could be trapping. But with board Td 5d 7h Js, the Js might have missed them. They might have a hand like TT, JJ, AJ, etc. But they checked. I have Ace high. I could try to bluff, representing a J or a strong hand. But with only 21 pot, and my stack 190, a bluff might work if opponent is weak. However, they might call with any pair. I have some equity if I get called: I have 6 outs to pair my Ace (3 Aces left), maybe 3 outs to pair my 4 (but that's weak). Also backdoor"

Flop: they bet 4, I called 4, pot now 21.\n\nTurn: Js. No flush yet. I have nothing but Ace high. I'm getting 21:0 odds to check (no bet). I could check and see what opponent does. They might bet again with a wide range since they raised preflop and bet flop. They could have a pair, a draw, or air.\n\nMy stack: 190 chips (95 BB). Opponent has 190 chips. Pot is 21. Not huge.\n\nGiven my weak hand and only Ace high, I should probably check and fold to a bet unless I get good odds. But I have position - I can check and see what they do. If they check behind, I get a free river. If they bet, I need to evaluate.\n\nActually, I have the option to bet as a bluff. But with Ace high on a board with T-5-7-J, there are many draws (flush draw, straight draws). My hand has some showdown value if checked through, but not much.\n\nBetter to check and see what opponent does. If they bet small, maybe I call if I think they're bluffing and I have some equity with Ace high. But realistically, I'm probably behind.\n\nLet me think about opponent's range: They raised preflop from late position, could be wide. They bet flop on Td 5d 7h, could be continuation bet. Turn Js might hit some of their range (JJ, AJ, KJ, QJ, JT). Also flush draws.\n\nMy hand blocks some Ax hands that might bluff.\n\nGiven I have no history on opponent, and it's early in tournament, I should play cautiously. Check and evaluate.\n\nDecision: check.",

            "reasoning_content": "The user is playing poker and needs to make a decision. They are on the turn with A4 offsuit, board Td 5d 7h Js. Their position is BTN, stack 190 chips. Pot is 21 chips. Amount to call is 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. They need to output a JSON object with action, raise_to, reasoning.\n\nI need to think about the hand. I have A4o, Ace high with weak kicker. Board has two diamonds, I have 4d giving me a backdoor flush draw (need two more diamonds). Also board T-5-7-J, not much straight potential for my hand. I have position, opponent raised preflop from seat 5 (late position) and bet flop. Turn brought Js, no flush. Pot is 21, no bet to call. I can check, raise, or fold. Folding seems too weak when I can check for free. Raising could be a bluff, but with Ace high and no strong draw, probably not good. Checking seems standard to see what opponent does on river, maybe bluff catch if they check behind or bet small.\n\nBut wait, I have position, I'm last to act. Actually, on turn, opponent acted first? Let's see: preflop: seat 5 raised, I called. Flop: I checked, seat 5 bet, I called. Turn: board shown, now it's my action? Actually, the hand description says \"=== Hand #1 - TURN ===\" and shows board, then \"Amount to call: 0\". That suggests it's my turn to act, and opponent has not acted yet? But in Texas Hold'em, after flop, the action continues with the first player still in hand left of the dealer. I'm BTN (seat 3), opponent is seat 5. Typically, the order would be: after flop, first to act is the player left of the dealer. I'm BTN, so opponent in seat 5 might be first to act? Actually, need to consider positions. Seats: 1, 2, 3 (me BTN), 4, 5. Blinds: seat 2 posted SB, seat 3 (me) posted BB. Preflop: seat 4 folded, seat 5 raised, seat 1 folded, seat 2 folded, I called. So there are two players: me (BB) and seat 5 (raiser). On flop, first to act is the player left of the dealer? Actually, the dealer button is at seat 3 (me). So the small blind (seat 2) would act first, but they folded. So the first to act postflop is the next player after the dealer, which is seat 4, but they folded. Then seat 5, then me. So seat 5 acts first postflop. On flop, I checked, seat 5 bet, I called. On turn, the action should start with seat 5 again. But the interface says \"Amount to call: 0\" and legal actions for me. That suggests it's my turn to act, meaning seat 5 has already acted and checked? Or maybe the interface is showing that it's my turn because I'm the user? Wait, the description might be that the turn card is dealt, and now it's my action because I'm the user and the opponent has not acted yet? Actually, typical poker interface: after turn card, the first player to act is the one left of the dealer. That would be seat 5. But maybe the system is waiting for my action because I'm the user and the opponent's action is simulated after mine? Or maybe the opponent has already checked? The \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests there is no bet to call, meaning opponent has checked. Because if opponent had bet, amount to call would be >0. So opponent must have checked. That makes sense: on turn, opponent checked, and now it's my action with option to check, raise, or fold.\n\nThus, opponent checked the turn. That's interesting. They raised preflop, bet flop, then checked turn. Could be weakness, could be trapping. But with board Td 5d 7h Js, the Js might have missed them. They might have a hand like TT, JJ, AJ, etc. But they checked. I have Ace high. I could try to bluff, representing a J or a strong hand. But with only 21 pot, and my stack 190, a bluff might work if opponent is weak. However, they might call with any pair. I have some equity if I get called: I have 6 outs to pair my Ace (3 Aces left), maybe 3 outs to pair my 4 (but that's weak). Also backdoor",

Opponent is GPT-OSS-120B with 182 chips.\n\nMy hand: Ace-high with backdoor flush draw (4d gives me a diamond draw, but board has Td 5d 7h Js - so I have 4d and As, so I have one diamond. Actually wait: I have 4d, board has Td, 5d, 7h, Js. So I have a flush draw with 4 diamonds? Let's count: I have 4d, board has Td, 5d - that's three diamonds total. Need two more diamonds for flush. Actually flush requires 5 cards of same suit. I have one diamond, board has two diamonds, so I need two more diamonds on river. That's not a flush draw, just backdoor.\n\nActually: I have 4d (diamond), board has Td (diamond), 5d (diamond) - that's three diamonds. So I have a flush draw needing two more diamonds? Wait, that's wrong: A flush is 5 cards of same suit. I have 1 diamond, board has 2 diamonds = 3 diamonds total. Need 2 more diamonds. But there's only one card to come (river). So I cannot make a flush unless I already have a flush draw with 4 diamonds. I only have 3 diamonds, so not a flush draw.\n\nSo my hand is Ace-high with weak pair potential. I have A4 offsuit. Board is Td 5d 7h Js. I have no pair, no straight draw (need 6-8-9 or something). Actually I have gutshot straight draw? Board T-5-7-J. I have A4. Possible straights: 8-9-T-J-Q for straight, or 9-T-J-Q-K, etc. Not relevant. I have backdoor flush draw with 3 diamonds, but need runner-runner diamonds.\n\nSo essentially I have Ace-high with very little equity. Opponent bet small on flop (4 into 13? Let's calculate: preflop pot was: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6, I called 4 more. So preflop pot = 1+2+6+4 = 13? Actually SB folded, so SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6 (so total 6), I call 4 more (total 10). Wait, let's track: Seat 2 posted SB 1, folded. Seat 3 (me) posted BB 2. Seat 5 raised to 6. I called 4 more. So pot preflop: SB 1 (folded), BB 2, raise 6, call 4 = 13 chips. Yes.\n\nFlop: I check, opponent bets 4 into 13, I call 4. Pot becomes 13+4+4 = 21.\n\nTurn: I check, opponent bets 8 into 21. Pot now 21+8 = 29 if I call. I need to call 8 to win 29, so pot odds 8:29 \u2248 3.6:1, or about 21.6% equity needed.\n\nWhat equity do I have? Against what range? Opponent raised preflop from CO? Actually Seat 5 is CO? Wait positions: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 SB, Seat 3 BB (me), Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 is button? No, I'm button (Seat 3). Actually positions: Seat 1 is UTG? Let's see: Blinds 1/2, Seat 2 posted SB, Seat 3 posted BB, Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 raised. So Seat 5 is CO? Or maybe Seat 5 is UTG? Actually typical 5-handed: Seat 1 UTG, Seat 2 SB, Seat 3 BB, Seat 4 Button? Wait, I'm button (Seat 3). That means positions are: Seat 4 is CO, Seat 5 is UTG? Hmm.\n\nAnyway, opponent raised preflop from late position. Could have wide range. Bet small on flop (4 into 13), and small on turn (8 into 21). This looks like continuation bet with moderate strength. Could be pair like TT, JJ, maybe AJ, KT, etc. Or could be bluff with overcards.\n\nI need to recall opponent tendencies.

Opponent is GPT-OSS-120B with 182 chips.\n\nMy hand: Ace-high with backdoor flush draw (4d gives me a diamond draw, but board has Td 5d 7h Js - so I have 4d and As, so I have one diamond. Actually wait: I have 4d, board has Td, 5d, 7h, Js. So I have a flush draw with 4 diamonds? Let's count: I have 4d, board has Td, 5d - that's three diamonds total. Need two more diamonds for flush. Actually flush requires 5 cards of same suit. I have one diamond, board has two diamonds, so I need two more diamonds on river. That's not a flush draw, just backdoor.\n\nActually: I have 4d (diamond), board has Td (diamond), 5d (diamond) - that's three diamonds. So I have a flush draw needing two more diamonds? Wait, that's wrong: A flush is 5 cards of same suit. I have 1 diamond, board has 2 diamonds = 3 diamonds total. Need 2 more diamonds. But there's only one card to come (river). So I cannot make a flush unless I already have a flush draw with 4 diamonds. I only have 3 diamonds, so not a flush draw.\n\nSo my hand is Ace-high with weak pair potential. I have A4 offsuit. Board is Td 5d 7h Js. I have no pair, no straight draw (need 6-8-9 or something). Actually I have gutshot straight draw? Board T-5-7-J. I have A4. Possible straights: 8-9-T-J-Q for straight, or 9-T-J-Q-K, etc. Not relevant. I have backdoor flush draw with 3 diamonds, but need runner-runner diamonds.\n\nSo essentially I have Ace-high with very little equity. Opponent bet small on flop (4 into 13? Let's calculate: preflop pot was: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6, I called 4 more. So preflop pot = 1+2+6+4 = 13? Actually SB folded, so SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6 (so total 6), I call 4 more (total 10). Wait, let's track: Seat 2 posted SB 1, folded. Seat 3 (me) posted BB 2. Seat 5 raised to 6. I called 4 more. So pot preflop: SB 1 (folded), BB 2, raise 6, call 4 = 13 chips. Yes.\n\nFlop: I check, opponent bets 4 into 13, I call 4. Pot becomes 13+4+4 = 21.\n\nTurn: I check, opponent bets 8 into 21. Pot now 21+8 = 29 if I call. I need to call 8 to win 29, so pot odds 8:29 \u2248 3.6:1, or about 21.6% equity needed.\n\nWhat equity do I have? Against what range? Opponent raised preflop from CO? Actually Seat 5 is CO? Wait positions: Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 SB, Seat 3 BB (me), Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 is button? No, I'm button (Seat 3). Actually positions: Seat 1 is UTG? Let's see: Blinds 1/2, Seat 2 posted SB, Seat 3 posted BB, Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 raised. So Seat 5 is CO? Or maybe Seat 5 is UTG? Actually typical 5-handed: Seat 1 UTG, Seat 2 SB, Seat 3 BB, Seat 4 Button? Wait, I'm button (Seat 3). That means positions are: Seat 4 is CO, Seat 5 is UTG? Hmm.\n\nAnyway, opponent raised preflop from late position. Could have wide range. Bet small on flop (4 into 13), and small on turn (8 into 21). This looks like continuation bet with moderate strength. Could be pair like TT, JJ, maybe AJ, KT, etc. Or could be bluff with overcards.\n\nI need to recall opponent tendencies.

            "reasoning_content": "No history available. This might be early in tournament. Let's analyze based on hand.\n\nMy hand: A4 offsuit. Board Td 5d 7h Js. I have Ace-high, backdoor flush draw (3 diamonds, need runner-runner), no straight draw. Very weak hand.\n\nOpponent's actions: Raised preflop from late position (likely CO or UTG depending on seating). Bet small on flop (4 into 13, ~30% pot). Bet small on turn (8 into 21, ~38% pot). This could be betting for value with medium strength (pair of Jacks, Tens, maybe overpair like QQ-AA, though would likely bet bigger). Could be bluff with missed overcards.\n\nPot odds: Need 8 to call, pot will be 37 after my call? Actually pot is 29 now (21+8), I call 8 makes pot 37. My investment 8 to win 29, so need ~21.6% equity.\n\nWhat equity does A4o have against reasonable range? Let's estimate: Against top 20% hands (77+, A9s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KQo), A4o has about 18% equity on this board. Against tighter range (top 10%: 77+, ATs+, KQs, AJo+), maybe 15%. Against bluff range (any two cards), maybe 30-40%. But opponent likely has something given betting on two streets.\n\nThe small bet sizes suggest opponent doesn't have monster (would bet bigger for value). Could be betting for protection with medium pair (like JJ, TT, 99, 88, maybe 77). Board has Td 5d 7h Js. Possible sets: TT, 55, 77, JJ. But would likely bet bigger. Could have two pair: JT, T7, J5, etc.\n\nMy Ace-high is likely not good. I have 3 outs to pair Ace (3 Aces left), but need to discount because opponent might have AJ, AT, etc. So maybe 1.5 outs. Backdoor flush needs runner-runner diamonds: probability ~4.5%. So total equity maybe ~10%.\n\nPot odds require 21.6%. So fold unless I think opponent bluffing frequently.\n\nBut I have position (button). Calling allows me to see river and potentially bluff if diamond comes or Ace comes. However, my stack is 190, opponent 182. Pot is small relative to stacks.\n\nTournament considerations: early stage, preserve stack. This is a marginal spot. I think folding is correct. The small bet sizing could be inducing calls, but I have very little equity.\n\nLet's consider if I raise as bluff. Could represent strong hand like flush draw, straight draw, two pair. But opponent has shown strength by betting two streets. Raising would be risky with Ace-high. Minimum raise to 16 (total). That's 16 to call for opponent into pot of 29+16=45? Actually if I raise to 16 total (I put 16, opponent put 8 already, so additional 8 for me). Pot would be 29+8=37, opponent needs to call 8 more. So pot odds for opponent 8:37 \u2248 4.6:1. They'll call with any decent hand. Bluff likely fails.\n\nBetter to fold. I'll fold.\n\nResponse JSON: {\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A4o with Ace-high on Td 5d 7h Js board has minimal equity (~10%).

Ah is hearts, Jh hearts, so suited Ace-Jack (A\u2665 J\u2665). That's a strong hand UTG in early position. In 8-player tournament, with 100 BB stack, should raise. Raise size? Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., 2 raise). Typically raise to 3-4 BB = 6-8 chips. But min raise is 4 (i.e., 2 extra). Could raise larger. Legal actions include raise; we can raise to any amount above min. Should we consider stack depth? 100 BB, can open-raise 2.5-3 BB. So raise to 6 chips (3 BB) maybe.\n\nBut we must output raise_to total amount we put in. The total amount includes our call? Usually raise_to is total amount we put in this round. So if we raise to 6, that's total contribution = 6 chips. Since we already need to call 2, additional 4. That's fine.\n\nReasoning: strong hand, early position, want to build pot and isolate. Also consider opponent tendencies? Not needed now.\n\nThus action: raise to 6.",

Raising could get value from weaker hands like KQ, Q9, etc. But risk: opponent could have a set (TT) and would raise? Actually they checked, maybe they are slow playing a set. Raising could get them to call with set? They might call, but we would lose more chips. Considering stack 190, pot currently? Let's compute pot after turn before action: Preflop pot 11 (maybe). Flop: bet 4, call 4 = 8 added, pot = 19? Actually after flop, pot before betting was 11. Then we bet 4, opponent call 4, pot becomes 11+8 = 19. Turn card J added to board, no bet yet, pot stays 19. Now it's our turn with amount to call 0. So pot is 19. If we raise to 4 (minimum), we would add 4 more, pot 23. Opponent may call or fold.\n\nGiven we have top pair, maybe we should bet for value. But opponent checked, could be weak, we can extract value. However risk of set? Set of tens would be very strong; they'd likely bet, not check. But they might check to trap. In tournament with 95 BB, we can afford a raise.\n\nThus I think raise to 8 (double) maybe? Minimum raise is 4 (to total 4? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in this round. Since amount to call is 0, raise_to is the total we commit this street. Minimum raise to 4 means we must put at least 4 chips. So raise_to could be 8 to apply pressure.

It's offsuit, not connected, and the queen is dominated by many hands. This is a clear fold in almost all situations.\n\n**Position considerations:**\n- UTG is the worst position preflop - I'll be first to act on all streets\n- I have 8 players behind me who could have strong hands\n- With a weak hand like Q6o, I should be very tight from UTG\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- I have 16.4 BB, which is a short/medium stack\n- I need to preserve my chips for better spots\n- Calling 8 chips (1 BB) would cost me ~6% of my stack with a very weak hand\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data, I can see:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) has raised preflop recently (Hand 44)\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has been active with calls and raises\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has also raised preflop\n- Generally, players seem willing to play hands and some are aggressive\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- With 16.4 BB, I'm in the danger zone but not desperate yet\n- I should wait for a much better hand to commit chips\n- Q6o from UTG has very low equity against typical calling/raising ranges\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. Q6o is not a playable hand from UTG with any stack size, especially with a medium-short stack where preservation is important.",

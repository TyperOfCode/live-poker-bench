In hand 78, they raised preflop to 32 and then made a big raise on the flop to 148. Their showdowns show they play reasonable hands (AdJs, 7cJs, 5hQh).\n\n**My situation**: \n- I have a small pocket pair with 7.4 BB left\n- I'm getting pot odds: 48 to win 72 = 1.5:1, which is not great for a small pair\n- With a small pair, I'm usually flipping against overcards (50/50) or dominated against higher pairs (20/80)\n- I need to get lucky and hit a set to have a strong hand\n- If I call 48, I'll have 71 chips left (4.4 BB)\n- If I raise all-in to 119, I'm risking my tournament life with a marginal hand\n- The raiser has been tight, suggesting they likely have a strong hand range\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \nWith only 7.4 BB, I need to make a move soon, but 44 is not a great hand to do it with. I should wait for a better spot, preferably with a hand that has better equity against a tight raiser's range, or when I'm first to act.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. I don't have the odds to call, and going all-in with 44 against a tight player who just raised 3x is -EV. I should preserve my chips for a better spot.",

Even when hitting a pair, I'd often be dominated.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: GPT-OSS-120B has been active with raises ranging from 4-106 chips, suggesting a wide range. Their 48-chip raise (3x BB) is typical for their preflop aggression.\n\n**Mathematical Consideration**: The pot is 72 chips and I need to call 32, requiring about 31% equity to break even. Q4o likely has only 15-20% equity against a typical raising range.\n\n**Tournament Strategy**: At 12.5 BB stack, I need to be highly selective. Q4o falls well below the threshold for defending against a raise, even from the button position.\n\nThe pot odds don't justify calling with such a weak hand, and I have no positional advantage post-flop since the raiser will act after me.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q4o is too weak to call a 48-chip raise with only 15-20% equity against the opponent's range.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand Analysis**: I have Q4o (Qh 4d) on the button. This is a very weak hand, especially offsuit.\n\n2. **Opponent Analysis**: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 48 chips (3x the big blind). Looking at their history, they've been quite active with raises of various sizes - from 4 to 106 chips. Their most recent raise was 32 chips in hand #78, so this 48-chip raise is in line with their typical range.\n\n3. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position, but my hand is very weak.\n\n4. **Stack Size**: I have 200 chips (12.5 BB), which is a medium stack. The opponent has 244 chips.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: The pot is 72 chips, and I need to call 32 to see the flop. This gives me pot odds of 72:32 = 2.25:1, which is about 31% equity needed to break even.\n\n6. **Hand Strength**: Q4o is a very weak hand. It has very little straight potential (only A23 and 56 would give me straights), no flush potential, and the queen kicker is weak. Even if I hit a pair, I'll often be dominated.\n\n7. **Tournament Considerations**: I'm at 12.5 BB, so I need to be selective about my hands. Q4o is definitely in the \"fold\" category preflop.\n\n8. **Button Position**: While the button is good position, it doesn't make a weak hand like Q4o playable against a raise, especially when I'm out of position post-flop (the raiser will have position on me).\n\nGiven that Q4o is such a weak hand and I need about 31% equity to call profitably, this hand doesn't come close. Even against a wide range, Q4o would probably have around 15-20% equity at best.\n\n\nThe mathematical calculation confirms my initial instinct. With only 15-20% equity against a typical raising range, calling would be a significant mistake. The pot odds of 31% required are substantially higher than my hand's actual winning potential. This means folding is the only logical decision, preserving my tournament stack for a better opportunity.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We have UTG with A\u2663 K\u2660, stack 292 (18.2 BB). Blinds 8/16, we face a raise? Actually actions: Seat2 posted SB 8, Seat4 posted BB 16. So no raises yet, it's just blinds. Amount to call 16 (big blind). Minimum raise to 32. So we can call 16 (i.e., just complete the big blind) or raise. We are UTG (early position) with AKo. In a tournament with 18 BB, we are shortish. AKo is a strong hand, but raising is typical. Need to consider opponent tendencies: Seat2 (Kimi-K2) is the SB, but they haven't acted yet? Actually SB already posted, but they are next after us? UTG is seat5, order: seat5 (us), then seat6? Actually seat numbers: seat1,2,3,4,5 (us). So after UTG, next seat is seat6? Not listed. Probably seat1 is next after seat5? Actually typical order: seats 1-8 clockwise. If we are seat5, next is seat6 (not listed), then seat7, seat8, seat1, seat2 (SB), seat3 (folded), seat4 (BB). But anyway, we just need to decide raise or call. With 18 BB, we could consider a raise to 3x BB (48) to build pot and maybe isolate. Opponents: Kimi-K2 (seat2) appears to raise various amounts preflop, sometimes small (12, 16, 24) but also big (157). They are maybe aggressive. MiniMax-M2 (seat4) is BB with 200 chips. Unknown tendencies.\n\nGiven our stack is shortish, we want to avoid being blinded out. AKo is a premium hand, we should raise. Minimum raise to 32 (2x BB). Typically raise 3x BB = 48. That would be raise_to 48. That is legal (>= minimum). Our stack can cover.\n\nThus decision: raise to 48. Reasoning: strong hand, early position, need to build pot, isolate, avoid being stuck with big blind, etc.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Seats: seat1,2 folded, seat3 raise. So likely UTG (first to act after blinds). 5x raise is a standard size. Pocket 8s is a decent hand to call in BB vs a raise, but also could be 3-bet for value. However 8s is not premium, but still ahead of many hands. In tournament with 99 BB, you can afford to call and see flop. But also consider implied odds: 8s can hit set. So call is fine.

Actually after flop, actions list not shown. The legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call 0, it's our turn. So opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) must have checked to us. So we have a set on a paired board (two sevens). Potential for full house if a 7 appears (board already has pair). Our eights are not on board, so we have set, which is best likely unless opponent has a full house already (like 7-7 or 3-3). Opponent could have 7x, 3x, or a straight? Board is 3-7-7. No straight possibilities yet. So we should consider raising to protect and extract value. Stack sizes: both have ~190 chips. Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to at least 8 more than current bet? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 8 means you put 8 chips total? Minimum raise to 8 likely means you need to bet at least 8 chips. Pot is 21, so a raise to 8 would be a bet of 8 chips (since no prior bet). That is about 1/3 pot. Could be okay, but we might want bigger to protect against draws (like 6-8, 5-9 etc). However opponent may have a hand like 7-7 (full house) or 7-8 (full house) etc. We want value. Since stacks are shallow, we can go for bigger bet, maybe 12-15 chips. The raise must be at least 8, but we can raise to 15. Let's consider opponent's range: they raised preflop, likely strong. Could be 77, 33, 88, AK, AQ, etc. On flop with paired sevens, they could have 77 (full house), 7x (full house), 3x (full house), or overpairs (AA, KK). Our set is likely best vs most except full houses. So we want to extract value from weaker hands like top pair (7?), but they have 7 already on board, they'd need a 7 in hand to have full house, otherwise they have just a pair of sevens on board, which is a pair, not strong.

Opponent called flop bet, so likely has a hand with some equity: maybe a set of sevens, a straight draw, a flush draw, two pair lower, etc.\n\nPot is 51. Turn card 6c added. Now it's our turn to act first on turn (since we acted first on flop). Actually after flop, action order: seat5 acted first, seat3 called. On turn, seat5 acts first again. So we have option to bet/raise/check. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we can check or raise. Minimum raise to 15 (so raise to at least 15 more than current bet? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in? Minimum raise to 15 means we need to raise to at least 15? Actually we haven't bet yet on turn, so we could bet 15 minimum. So we could bet 15 (raise to 15). Or we could check.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: we have 175 chips, opponent 175. Pot 51. Turn we could bet for value, protect against draws. Our hand is strong but not best if opponent has set of sevens. Set of sevens would beat us. Probability opponent has set: preflop they raised, could have pocket 7s (there are two 7s on board, one left in deck). Actually board has two 7c and 7s. There are two sevens left in deck (7h,7d). Opponent could have pocket 7s (set). They called flop, which had paired sevens, they'd have a set and likely call. So we are behind if they have set. However we have a flush draw and two pair.\n\nWe could check to see opponent's action, but if they have set they'd likely bet. If they have a draw, they'd call or raise. We could bet to protect and get value from worse hands like a single 8? Actually opponent could have a single 8 (but we have both eights). So not. Could have a pair of 6s? 6c on board, they'd have a pair of 6s maybe, but they'd have two pair 6-7? Actually they'd have 6-7? If they have 6x, they'd have two pair 7s and 6s? Board has 6c, they could have 6d, they'd have two pair 7s and 6s, which is weaker than our eights and sevens. So we have value.\n\nThus betting for value is good. Size? Pot 51, we could bet about half pot to protect and get value: maybe 30-35. Minimum raise is 15, but we can raise to any amount up to our stack. Should we go all-in? Not necessary.\n\nGiven tournament, we have decent stack. I'd bet around 30. Since raise_to is total amount we put in, we need to specify total bet amount. Since no prior bet, raise_to = 30 (i.e., bet 30). Provide reasoning.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to: 30.",

But only seat 4 is left (MiniMax-M2) who called 2. Then it's SB's turn to act (we are SB). Amount to call is 1 (to match BB's 2? Actually BB already 2, SB posted 1, so to call need 1 more to make 2). So we face a 1 chip call. Minimum raise to 4 (so raise to total 4 chips). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand: 8d Jh unsuited. In SB with 112.5 BB, deep stack. Opponent called big blind, likely a wide-ish range maybe. 8J is a decent suited? It's off-suit, not great but can be played from SB sometimes against a single caller. The opponent's stack is 195 chips, similar. The pot now is SB (1) + BB (2) + opponent call (2) = 5. If we call, we put 1 more, pot becomes 6, we go to flop with 8J off-suit, stack 224 after call. If we raise to 4, we add 3 more chips (since we already posted 1). That would be a raise of 2? Actually raise to 4 total means we put total of 4 chips into pot. We have already 1, so need to add 3. That is a raise of 2 over the call amount (which is 2). Minimum raise is 4 total, so raise size is 2 over call. That is a small raise, typical to isolate. Could also consider folding but 8J is decent to see a cheap flop.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: we have no data. Could be random. Raising could isolate and give us position (post-flop we will be out of position because we are SB after BB and opponent is in BB? Actually after raise, the action will be on BB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) and opponent (MiniMax-M2) who called the big blind; but we raised, so both must act. The BB will act first (since SB raises, action goes to BB then to other players). So we would be out of position post-flop. So raising may not be great.\n\nGiven we have a mediocre hand, probably best to just call the 1 chip and see flop cheap. 8J offsuit can make top pair, straight draws. So call.\n\nThus decision: call.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: SB (seat5) with 8d Jh. Board 9h 5d 3c. Pot 6 chips (small). Opponent: Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called preflop, now after seat1 (BB) checked, it's our turn (SB). Seat4 hasn't acted yet? Actually order: SB is seat5, then BB seat1, then seat4 (CO?) Wait positions: seat5 SB, seat1 BB, seat4 is MP? Actually seat numbers: seat1 is BB, seat2 is maybe UTG? seat3? but irrelevant. The action order preflop: seat5 post sb (small blind) 1, seat1 post bb 2, seat2 fold, seat3 fold, seat4 call 2 (so limp), seat5 call 1 (complete sb), seat1 check (BB checks). So after preflop, we have three players: seat1 BB, seat4, seat5. The flop: board 9h5d3c. Action: seat1 checked, now seat4 acts? Actually order is seat4 (UTG?) but seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB, seat4 is CO? In typical order, after flop, action starts with first active player left of button. Button is seat5? Actually button is seat5? In heads-up? No, there are 5 seats but only 3 active. The button likely seat5? Actually seat5 is SB, seat1 BB, seat4 is maybe UTG? Usually button is seat? Not given. But we have amount to call 0, meaning it's our turn with no bet. So we can check or raise. Evaluate hand: 8d Jh, board 9h 5d 3c. We have gutshot straight draw? 8-J, board 9,5,3. Straight possibilities: 7-8-9-10-J? We have J, need 10 for open-ended? Actually we have 8 and J, board 9. So we have inside straight draw: need 10 to make 8-9-10-J? That would be 8-9-10-J? That's only four cards, need also 7 or Q? Let's examine: With 8 and J, possible straight combos: 7-8-9-10-J (needs 7 and 10) not possible. 8-9-10-J-Q (needs 10 and Q). So we have two outs? Actually need 10 to make 8-9-10-J? That's only four cards, need also something else? Straight of 8-9-10-J-Q requires Q also. So we need both 10 and Q? That's too many. So we have no straight draw. We have gutshot? 8-J with board 9-5-3: if a 7 comes, we have 7-8-9-? need? Not. So no immediate draw.\n\nWe have a backdoor flush draw? We have Jh, board has heart 9h, we have Jh (heart). So we have a flush draw with hearts: need two more hearts on turn and river. Currently one heart on board, we have one heart in hand, so two hearts needed for flush.\n\nWe have pair? No pair. So we have overcards (J) and 8 is middle. Not strong.\n\nOpponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called preflop, likely a wide range limp. They may have anything. They checked on flop. So likely they have weak or medium hand.\n\nGiven our stack 224, pot 6, we can check. Raising may be possible to steal? But we are out of position (SB) and opponent is in front (likely seat4 is next to act). We could attempt a small raise to take pot, but risk being called with better hand.\n\nBetter to check and see turn. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise.

Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to 4 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide action. 5h7s is a weak hand, suited but low. In BTN, can raise to try to steal, but it's a weak hand. However, the BB is Kimi-K2 with 200 chips, and SB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 192 chips. Actually seat 1 is SB, seat 2 is BB. Both are same opponent? Possibly two different players with same name? They are separate seats.\n\nWe have to consider opponent tendencies. Use recall_opponent_actions: we asked for raises preflop by Kimi-K2, got one: hand 2, preflop, seat 2 (BB) raised to 6. That's a raise from BB. Not much else. Could also check folds etc. But we have limited time. The BB may be aggressive, raising sometimes. Our hand is weak; calling might be okay to see flop cheap? But we are in BTN, we could raise to steal blinds. However 5-7 suited is not a great raise but can be used as a steal if opponent is tight. Not sure about opponent style.\n\nGiven we have 112 BB stack, we can afford to call and see flop, but with such weak hand we risk being out of position postflop (we are in BTN, will be first to act after flop? Actually BTN is after BB, so after flop the action starts with SB (seat1) then BB then BTN, so BTN is last to act preflop, but postflop, the first active player left of the dealer (BTN) is SB (if SB still in). If both SB and BB call, BTN acts first postflop. So we are out of position? Actually dealer acts last preflop, but first postflop. So we will be out of position. So raising with weak hand is risky.\n\nGiven the weak hand, best is to fold or call. Call is cheap 2 chips to see flop, maybe we can hit a straight draw (6-8) or flush draw (if hearts). 5h7s suited hearts, could make flush. But also could be dominated. Typically 5-7 suited is a marginal hand, but in BTN you could limp (call) and see flop cheap. Many players fold to raises. So we could call.\n\nWe need to consider pot odds: pot is 3, call 2 -> pot after call 5, chance to hit a good hand maybe 12%? Not great but okay.\n\nGiven the opponent might raise occasionally, we might want to avoid being raised and stuck with weak hand. So calling is safe.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Board: 9s 8h 5s 6c. Our hand: 5h 7s. So we have a pair of fives (bottom pair) plus a gutshot straight draw? Let's analyze: board shows 9-8-5-6. We have 7, which gives us a straight 5-6-7-8-9 (we have 7, board has 5-6-8-9, missing 7? Actually we have 7, so we have 5-6-7-8-9, that's a made straight! Wait board: 9s,8h,5s,6c. That's 5-6-8-9. Adding our 7 gives 5-6-7-8-9 = straight. Yes we have a straight (seven-high). Also we have pair of fives (but straight is better). So we have a made straight, good hand.\n\nOpponent (Seat 2) is the BB, 198 chips. On flop, they checked, we bet 2 (small), they called. On turn, they checked. Pot is now 9 chips (preflop 2+2? Let's compute: preflop: we called 2, they posted 2, pot 4. Flop: we bet 2, they call 2 => pot +4 =8. Plus blinds? Already accounted. Turn: pot currently 9? Wait after flop betting, pot should be 4 (preflop) + 2 (our bet) + 2 (their call) =8. But they say pot 9 chips. Possibly there is an extra chip from something else. Anyway.\n\nWe have a strong hand. Opponent checking. Options: check or raise. Since we have a straight, we want to get value. Opponent may have draws (e.g., open-ended straight draws, flush draws? Board has two spades (9s,5s) and we have 7s, so we have three spades, but not a flush yet. Opponent could have flush draw with spades, like AsKs. Also could have pair of 9s, 8s, etc. So we can raise for value. Minimum raise is 2 (so raise to 2? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 2 means we bet 2 chips. That's small. But we could raise bigger to extract value. But we are limited to legal actions: raise (no max given). We should consider stack sizes: opponent 198 chips, we 220. Pot is small (9). We could bet maybe 6-8 to get value. But we need to decide based on tournament stage: we have deep stack 110 BB, can afford to bet. Opponent may call with draws. So we could raise to maybe 8 (approx pot). However we must ensure raise is at least min raise 2 more than current bet? Since amount to call is 0, min raise is 2. So raise to 2 is allowed, but we can raise higher. The system expects a numeric raise_to. We need to decide.\n\nGiven we have a strong hand, we should raise to extract value. Let's maybe raise to 8 chips (so total put in 8). That is about pot size. Reason: value bet.\n\nWe must ensure we have enough chips: yes.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 8, reasoning.\n\n",

Actually preflop actions: Seat5 post_sb 1 (we posted small blind). Seat1 post_bb 2 (big blind). So we are in SB, not BB? Wait seat numbers: Position: BB (Seat5) but actions show seat5 posted sb 1. That suggests seat5 is small blind, seat1 is big blind. However description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat5)\". Might be a mismatch; but we consider we are BB (big blind) with 2 chips posted? But actions show seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2. So maybe they reversed: seat5 is small blind, seat1 is big blind. But they said position BB. Could be error. Anyway amount to call is 1 (the small blind). Since we posted small blind, we need to call 1 to match big blind of 2? Actually after SB and BB posted, the amount to call for the SB is the difference (2-1=1). So we can call 1 to complete. So we can call or raise. Hand is Q5 offsuit hearts. Not a strong hand. In early position (SB) but we are out of position after flop. Should we fold? In SB, Q5 is weak. Many players would fold to avoid playing out of position with weak hand. However we are already half blind; calling 1 is cheap. But we could also raise to steal? Not likely with Q5. Better to just call (complete) and see flop? In tournament with 113 BB, you can afford to limp. But with Q5 off, limp may be okay but could get raised. Better to fold? Since amount to call is just 1 (small blind) and we are out of position, calling is okay. But we may also consider raising to 4 (minimum raise). Q5 is not a raising hand. So call.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

So flop action: we are first to act (SB). Opponent likely has range of BB: maybe wide because small stack? Both stacks relatively shallow (around 200). We have 225. Pot 4.

Actually actions list: preflop: seat5 post_sb 1 (small blind). seat1 post_bb 2 (big blind). then seat5 call 1 (to match). seat1 check. flop: seat5 check, seat1 check. So now turn: it's seat5's action first (since they were first to act preflop). So we act now. Amount to call 0, min raise 2, legal actions: fold, check, raise. We have queen high, board heavily coordinated with spades, opponent could have spade flush draw, could have pair, could have straight draws? Not many. Likely they have something better than queen high. Checking is safe. Raising could be a bluff but small pot. Could try to steal pot? Opponent may call with any pair. But we have no showdown value.

So we should check, not bet, because we can't win at showdown unless opponent also has queen high or less (but they would have checked). Could they have a queen? Could they have Qx? They might have queen and check, but they could also have a lower pair like 4s? But they would have bet maybe. However they checked all streets, maybe they are checking with a weak hand, but we cannot profitably bet because we risk being called and losing chips.

We are on button, we can either raise to isolate or just call. 9T suited is a decent hand, can raise to build pot and possibly steal blinds. Opponents may call or 3-bet. Minimum raise is 4 (to total 4). Standard raise size maybe 3x BB = 6, but we could raise to 8 to match SB's previous raise size. Our stack is deep, can raise to 8 (total). That would be a raise of 6 (since we need to put 4 total? Wait amount to call is 2, min raise to 4 total, so raise to 8 would be +6). That's fine.\n\nWe need to consider pot odds: If we raise to 8, pot becomes 3+2+8? Actually we add 8 total, but we already call 2? No, raise to 8 means we put 8 chips total, not additional. So we put 8, pot becomes 3 (existing) + 8 (our raise) = 11 plus any other calls. Opponent may call 2 more (SB) and BB may call 6 more (since they already posted 2). Actually they posted 1 and 2, we raise to 8, they need to call 7 (SB) and 6 (BB) to see flop. That is large. Might discourage them.\n\nGiven their tendencies: BB raises to 6 often, maybe they like to raise from BB with decent hands. SB also raised to 8 previously, maybe they are aggressive.\n\nOur hand 9T suited is good for flop, but not premium. Might want to just call to see flop cheap, but we are on button and can take initiative. However raising may get us all-in if they re-raise. But stack sizes are deep enough.\n\nI think optimal: raise to 8 to isolate BB or SB, leveraging position. Reasoning: hand is strong, position, can win bigger pot, and opponents seem willing to call raises but also may fold.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 8.\n\n",

Since BB posted 2, SB posted 1, then raise to 4 means they added 2? Actually typical: raise to 4 means total bet 4. So they raised 2 more (from 2 to 4). But amount to call is 2 (the difference between 4 and our 2). Minimum raise to 6 (i.e., raise to at least 6 total). So legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nOur hand: K\u2662 3\u2663? Actually 3d Ks: King of spades, 3 of diamonds. So K\u26603\u2666 offsuit, a weak hand. In BB facing a raise from MP (seat 4). Our stack 226 chips, deep 113 BB. Position: BB vs raise from MP (probably early-ish). Opponent's tendencies: from recall, they have raised preflop in hand 11 (raise amount 4) and also called in hand 11 later (call 8). In hand 11 they raised preflop, then called a bet on flop? Actually they called 8 on flop (maybe after someone bet). In hand 11 they also checked flop and turn, then bet river 8. So they can be somewhat aggressive but also passive. Not enough data.\n\nK3 offsuit is a very weak hand, especially out of position. Should fold. No reason to call or raise.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Position: SB, out of position postflop. Hand is decent but not premium. Kc Tc suited is a suited broadway, can make straights, flushes. In early stage tournament, with 112 BB, you can be a bit aggressive but still consider fold vs raise.\n\nOpponent seat4: MiniMax-M2. We don't know tendencies. Could be random. Might be a raise from early position? Actually seat4 is MP? Table seats: seat1 is Kimi-K2 (BB). seat2 folded, seat3 folded, seat4 raise. So seat4 is UTG? Actually seat5 is SB, seat1 BB, seat4 is CO? Wait seats: 1 BB, 2 UTG? But seat numbers not important. But seat4 raising from middle position maybe. Since it's a 5-player? Actually we have seats 1-5, but seats 2 and 3 folded, leaving 3 players: seat4, seat5 (us), seat1 (BB). So seat4 raised from CO (cutoff) or maybe UTG? In any case, raise of 4 is small (2x big blind). So it's a standard opening.\n\nOur hand Kc Tc suited is a decent open-raising hand but we are out of position. Calling is okay to see flop, but could also 3-bet? But we have limited stack but still deep. 3-bet to maybe 12? Might be too aggressive against unknown. Since raise is small, could just call and see flop.\n\nPot odds: need to call 3 into pot 7+? Actually pot before action is 7 (SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 4? Actually raise 4 includes the 2 big blind? The raise to 4 means total bet is 4, so pot now: 1+2+4 =7. To call need 3 more, pot after call would be 10. So pot odds ~3/10 = 30% needed. Hand equity vs random? Kc Tc suited vs unknown range maybe ~20%? So maybe not profitable call.\n\nBut we can consider 3-bet as a bluff/ value. However with 112 BB we can afford to fold marginal hands. I'd lean to fold.\n\nBut we might also consider that opponent's raise could be wide, and we have decent suited connectors. Could call and try to flop. However we are out of position and have many players left. In tournament, preserving stack is important.\n\nThus I think fold.\n\nLet's produce JSON.",

Minimum raise to 24 (i.e., re-raise to 24 total). Our stack is 224, deep. Pocket sevens are a medium pair. In BB vs a 3-bet from UTG? Not sure position: Seat1 is likely UTG? Table seats: Seat1 is early position (maybe UTG). Kimi-K2 Thinking likely a tight-ish player? We have recall: they raised preflop to 8 and 12 in previous hands. Those were 3-bets? Actually they raised to 8 and 12 (maybe from SB?). Not much info. We can consider 3-bet size: 14 is about 7x big blind (big blind 2). That's a fairly standard 3-bet. Pocket sevens are a marginal 3-bet defense. Could call to set mine, but set odds are low: need to hit set on flop (prob ~12%). Pot after call would be 14+10 call+ our 4? Actually pot currently: initial pot 21 (includes blinds and our raise). After K's raise to 14, pot is 21 + (14-4)=31? Wait compute: blinds 1+2 =3, we raised to 4 (adding 2 more). So pot after our raise: 3+2=5? Actually raise to 4 means we put 4 total, so contributed 2 extra over blind, pot = 1+2+2 =5? Not sure. But anyway, call 10 adds to pot. Pot odds: call 10 to win maybe ~? If we call, pot will be about 21+10+? Actually after raise to 14, pot includes 14 from K and 4 from us plus 3 blinds =21? That's what they said pot 21 before actions. After K's raise, pot becomes 21+ (14-4)=31. Call 10 adds to pot making 41. So pot odds ~10/41 ~24%. Set odds ~12% => not profitable.

BB is last to act preflop. With 6-6, typical action: either raise small to isolate or check to see flop. Given deep stack (111 BB), but tournament early stage. SB just called, so SB likely has a wide range. Raising could isolate and get heads-up, but also risk re-raise from later players? There are no later players (only SB and BB). So it's heads-up. With 6-6, raise to maybe 6-8 to isolate and get value from overpairs? But also could just check and try to hit set. In BB, checking is common for small pairs to see flop cheap. Considering stack depth, we could check and hope for set. If flop is favorable, we can bet. So I'd check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. So choose check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

There is potential for straight draws? Board K,8,A: no straight possibilities yet. So opponent likely has strong hand or is bluffing. With underpair, we likely fold.

But calling 3 for a pot of 10 gives pot odds 3/(10+3)=3/13 ~23% needed. Our hand equity vs random hand is low (<20%). So folding is correct.\n\nCheck if any reason to call? Perhaps if opponent is very tight and only bets with strong, then we fold. If opponent is aggressive and often bets with nothing, maybe call to see turn. But we have no outs beyond hitting a six on turn/river. Probability to improve to set: remaining two sixes in deck, 47 unknown cards, chance on turn ~2/47=4.3%, on river if miss turn ~2/46=4.3% again. So low.

          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 7c Js. Opponent in Seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (maybe same as Kimi-K2). They posted BB 2. So we are BB after SB posted 1 and BB posted 2. So preflop we are in BB, facing no raise (just the forced blind). Amount to call is 1 (to match SB? Actually BB already posted 2, SB posted 1, pot 3. Amount to call is 1 to match SB? Wait: In BB, after SB posts 1, BB posts 2, then action goes to UTG etc. But all others folded, so we are last to act preflop with only SB and BB posted. Since we are BB, we have already posted 2, but we can check (i.e., do nothing) or raise. The amount to call is 1 to match SB's 1? Actually SB already posted 1, BB posted 2, so we are already 2 in, so to call we would need to put in 0? Usually if no raise, BB can check. But they say amount to call: 1, maybe because they treat that we need to call SB's 1 to even out? But we already posted 2, which is more than SB's 1, so we are already ahead. In many implementations, amount to call is 0 for BB when no raise. But they show amount to call 1, maybe they consider we can call the SB's 1 to make it even? That seems off. But legal actions include raise. We'll assume we can check (call 0) or raise. They gave amount to call 1, but legal actions: fold, call, raise. So call means put 1 more? That would be weird because then we would put total 3? That would be a raise effectively. But maybe they treat that we need to call SB's 1 to complete the bet. So if we \"call\", we will put 1 chip, making total 3 in pot from us? That seems like a raise but maybe they treat as call. But we can also raise to minimum 4 (total). So we need to decide.\n\nHand 7c Js is a suited connector, decent for BB but not premium. Stack 221 chips (110.5 BB). In early tournament, with 110 BB, we can be flexible. In BB, we can limp (call) or raise. Opponent Kimi-K2 has been raising preflop to 6 (3x BB) in previous hands (hand numbers 2,7,8,16). That suggests they are aggressive, maybe raise from early position? But in this hand they are in seat1 (SB?) Actually seat1 posted SB 1. So they are SB, not raising. So they are not raising now.\n\nWe are BB; we can either check (call 0) or raise. 7c Js is not a hand to limp often; could raise to steal blinds? But we are in BB, and SB is likely to fold to raise. However SB is Kimi-K2, who may be aggressive but not sure. Since we have decent hand, raising could be good to isolate and pick up the pot. Minimum raise to 4 total, meaning raise by 2 chips (since we already have 2 in? Actually total to 4 means we add 2 more). That would be a small raise, about 2x BB. That could be effective.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to raise preflop to 6 in earlier hands, they might be comfortable calling a small raise? But they are SB, they already posted 1, they'd need to call 3 more to match 4 total. That's 3 chips, which is fine. Might call.\n\nWe have 7c Js, suited, potential for straight and flush. In early stage, we might want to see flop cheap. Could also just check and see flop for free. But raising might give us chance to win the pot now, and also define opponent.\n\nGiven stack depth, I'd likely raise to 8 or 10 to apply pressure, but min raise is 4. Could raise larger if allowed? Legal actions only mention raise, not max. Usually you can raise any amount above min. But we need to decide raise_to value. Could raise to 8 (4x BB). That would be a decent raise.\n\nBut we need to consider tournament: 110 BB, not urgent to steal blinds. 7c Js is decent for a steal. I'd raise to 8 chips.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 8.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Opponent (Seat1) called 4 (so they called 4 more to match our raise? Actually we raised to 6, they called 4 (since they already posted 2 big blind? Wait preflop: we are BB, posted 2. Seat1 is SB, posted 1. Then we raise to 6 (so add 4). Seat1 call 4 to match 6. So pot now: before flop: we have 6 (our raise) + 2 (our blind) = 8? Actually our total contribution is 6 (including blind). Opponent contributed 1 (blind) + 4 call =5. So total pot = 8+5 =13? But given pot 12 chips. Slight rounding. Anyway.\n\nNow flop: board T\u2665 2\u2665 3c. Our hand: 7c Js. That's a gutshot straight draw? We have J, board T, we need Q for straight (J Q K A? Actually with J and T, you need Q for straight JQK? Not correct. Let's examine: board T,2,3. Our J gives us open-ended? We have J, board T, we need Q or 9 for straight? Actually 9-J-T? That's not a straight. Straight combos: 9-10-J-Q-K? Not. With J and T, you need Q and K? Not. So we have just a Jack high, no pair, no flush draw (we have clubs, board hearts and club 3c, we have club 7c, board has 3c, no other clubs. So we have a backdoor flush draw (two more clubs needed).

Could be because not enough data. Let's search observations for Kimi-K2 raising flop.Let's try recall_my_hands? Might not help. Probably we have limited data. We can assume opponent is unknown.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, we likely should check. However, we could consider a small raise as a bluff to steal pot. Opponent's stack is 182, pot is 12. A raise to maybe 12 or 15 could be effective. But we are deep stack 108 BB. In tournament early stage, we can preserve chips.

That's a gutshot: need 8 to make 7-8-9-T-J straight. Also we could have J-10? We have J, board has T, so we have pair of J? Actually we have J, board T,9,2,3. No pair. We have backdoor flush? Suits: we have 7c Js (clubs and spades). Board: Th (hearts), 2h (hearts), 3c (clubs), 9s (spades). We have 2 clubs? board has 3c, we have 7c, so we have two clubs, need two more clubs for flush, unlikely. We have two spades? board 9s, we have Js, so two spades, need two more spades.\n\nWe are in BB, we posted 2, then raised to 6 preflop, opponent called 4 (so they called 4 extra). So pot after preflop: we put 6, opponent put 4+2? Actually opponent posted bb 2, then we raise 6 (so total 6). Opponent call 4 (to match 6). So pot = 2 (our sb) + 2 (bb)?? Wait we are BB seat 5, posted 2. Actually preflop actions: Seat5 post_sb 1 (small blind?), but seat5 is BB? Wait position: BB seat5. But they posted sb 1? That seems contradictory: maybe seat5 is SB? Actually blinds: 1/2. So SB is 1 chip, BB is 2 chips. Seat5 posted sb 1, seat1 posted bb 2. So seat5 is SB, not BB. But they said Position: BB (Seat5). Might be error. Anyway, we are small blind? The pot after preflop: SB 1, BB 2, raise to 6 by us (SB), opponent call 4 (makes total 6). So total pot: SB 1 + BB 2 + additional 5 (our raise beyond BB?) Actually raise to 6 means we put total 6 chips (including SB 1). So we added 5 more. Opponent call 4 (they had already 2 as BB, need add 4 to reach 6). So pot = 6 (our total) + 6 (opponent total) =12. That's consistent with pot 12 shown.\n\nFlop: Th 2h 3c. Both checked. Turn: 9s. Now it's our turn? Actually actions: we are seat5, opponent seat1. Turn actions not listed yet. We need to act. Amount to call? Not given, but legal actions: fold, check, raise. So opponent hasn't acted yet on turn? Usually order: SB acts first preflop, but after flop, the player left of button? In heads-up, the SB is first to act post-flop. So seat5 (SB) acts first. So we have option to check or raise. Opponent will act after us.\n\nOur hand: 7c Js. Board now: Th 2h 3c 9s. We have gutshot to straight needing 8. Also we have overcards J and 7, but J is top pair? Actually board has T, we have J, so we have Ace-high? No Ace not present. So J is just a higher card, but no pair.\n\nWe have 108 BB stack, deep. Opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking has 182 chips, about 91 BB. Both deep.\n\nWe need to consider opponent's tendencies: from recall, they have raised preflop a few times, but no turn raises info. So unknown.\n\nWhat is pot odds?

Raising now could be a bluff, but risk.\n\nGiven we have no made hand, likely best to check and see opponent's action. If opponent bets, we can decide to call if bet is small relative to pot?

Another: 7-8-9-10-J: we have 7c and J, board has 9 and T, missing 8. Not there. So no made hand, just high card J. Opponent (Seat1) checked both flop and turn. Likely they have weak hand or medium. River check? Actually we have amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. We can check or raise. Pot is 12 chips, stacks are large relative. We have J high, likely losing to any pair on board? Board has no pair, but opponent could have a pair like K, T, 9, etc. They could have Ace-high, etc. Our J is not strong.

Actually SB posted 2 (half blind?) Wait blinds are 2/4, so SB is 2, BB is 4. SB posted 2, then SB call 2? That seems they called the BB? Actually after posting SB, they can raise or check. The action shows \"Seat 4 post_sb 2\" then \"Seat 5 post_bb 4\". Then \"Seat 1 fold\", etc. Then \"Seat 4 call 2\". That means SB is checking? Actually call 2 means they call the BB's 4? No, they'd need to call 2 more to match BB's 4. So they call 2, making pot 8 (2+4+2). So we are in BB with amount to call 0 (since SB just called). So we can check or raise. Hand 7s8h is suited connectors, decent for stealing? In BB, after SB just called, it's a limp. We are out of position after flop (SB first). With 7-8 suited, could consider a raise to isolate. Stack 53 BB, can raise to 8 min, which is 2BB. That's a small raise, but could be okay. However SB just limped, likely weak. Raising could win pot now or set up flop. 7-8 suited is a decent hand for limping or raising? In early tournament, with 53 BB, maybe raise to 12-15? Minimum raise is 8. Raising to 8 is small, may get re-raised? But SB already called, they'd need to re-raise. Could also just check and see flop. But 7-8 suited is a speculative hand; playing postflop from out of position is tricky. However with 53 BB, we can afford to see flop cheap. The pot is 8, we can see flop for free if check. If flop hits, we have potential draws. I'd likely check to see flop and then decide. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We'll check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Our 8h gives us a pair of eights, plus a flush draw (spades: we have 7s, board has 8s and 9s spades, need two more spades for flush). Also we have open-ended straight draw? Cards: 7,8,9 on board, we have 7 and 8, so we have 7-8-9, need 6 or 10 for straight. We have 7,8 so we have gutshot? Actually we have 7 and 8, board 8, A,9. So we have 7-8-8-9-A. Straight possibilities: need 6 for 6-7-8-9-10? No 10 not present. Need 10 for 8-9-10-J-Q? Not. So we have open-ended? Not. We have a gutshot for 6-7-8-9-10 missing 6 or 10, but 10 not on board. So need 6 or 10. Not strong.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 bet 6 into pot 14 (so pot now 20). We are in BB with 212 chips. We have decent equity: we have pair, flush draw (2 outs to flush? Actually we have 7s, board has 8s,9s. So we have two spades on board? Wait board: 8s Ah 9s. That's two spades (8s,9s). We have 7s. So we have three spades total, need one more spade for flush. So 9 outs (13 spades left minus 3 known = 10? Actually spades in deck 13, we see 8s,9s,7s = 3, so 10 outs). Also we have a gutshot for straight (6 or 10). So total outs maybe 12 (excluding Aces and other combos). So equity ~ 12 outs on turn+river ~ about 24% maybe.\n\nPot odds: call 6 to win pot 20+6 = 26? Actually pot before call is 20 (14+6). To call 6 you get pot 20+6=26. So pot odds 6/26 = 23% required. Our equity maybe ~24% so borderline call. Also we have implied odds maybe if we hit flush we can win more chips. Opponent's stack: MiniMax-M2 has 211 chips, similar. So we could win about 200 chips. So implied odds good.\n\nWe could also consider raising. Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise total to 12). That would be raise of 6 more (total 12). That would be a semi-bluff maybe. Does opponent have tendency? Past recall shows only one flop bet of 3 in hand 18. Not much data.\n\nGiven we have decent equity and pot odds just barely favorable, calling is reasonable. Raising could be risky as we may be behind if opponent has Ace or 9 or pair. But we have top pair? Actually board Ace, we have pair of eights, opponent could have Ace high, or 9, or 8, or straight draws. Raising might isolate.\n\nI think call.\n\nThus JSON: action call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Actually board has 8s, we have 7s 8h, so we have top pair? Board: 8s (spade), Ah, 9s, 2c, 6h. Our 8h pairs with board 8s => pair of eights. Also we have a straight draw? Board: A, 9, 8, 6, 2. Our 7 gives us 6-7-8-9 straight? Actually we have 6 on board, 7 in hand, 8 on board, 9 on board => that's a straight 6-7-8-9-10? No, need 10 for that. 5-6-7-8-9 would be straight, we have 5? No. So we have no straight. We have flush draw? Board has two spades (8s, 9s). Our 7s is spade, gives three spades. Not a flush. So our hand is just a pair of eights, which is second pair behind Ace high. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 24 on river. Let's consider opponent's range.\n\nPreflop: opponent (Seat 4) posted small blind 2, then called 2 (big blind) preflop. So they have a wide range, likely any two cards.\n\nFlop: board 8s Ah 9s. Opponent bet 6 into pot 12? Pot after preflop: we had 4 (bb) + 2 (sb) + call 2 = 8? Actually preflop: SB 2, BB 4, others folded, SB called 2, BB checked. So pot 8. Flop bet 6, we called 6, pot 20. Flop board: 8s Ah 9s. Opponent bet 6 (small). Could be many hands: top pair Aces, middle pair 9s, 8s, draws, etc.\n\nTurn: board 2c, turn bet 12 by us (BB) after opponent checked. So we bet 12 into pot 20 (after flop). We have 8 pair, maybe we think we are ahead of many draws? Opponent called 12.\n\nRiver: board 6h. Opponent bets 24 into pot (68). So pot after turn: pre-turn pot 20 + our bet 12 + call 12 = 44. River bet 24, pot 68 (makes sense). Opponent's bet 24 is about 35% of pot.\n\nOur hand: 8 pair, but opponent could have Ace (A? with kicker), could have 9, could have 8 (set?), could have straight draws that missed, could have flush draws. Let's consider opponent's possible holdings.\n\nGiven they called our turn bet 12, they might have a hand that wants to see river. Could be Ace, could be 9, could be 8, could be draws.\n\nNow river board: 6h. Does any new hand appear? Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9 would be a straight if opponent has 5. They don't have 5 (unknown). 6-7-8-9-10 would need 10. Not present. So only possible new hand is maybe a pair of 6s (if they have 6). Could be a flush? No spade flush, need 2 spades, we have 7s, board has 8s,9s. That's only 3 spades, need 5. Not possible. So river adds little.\n\nThus opponent's bet likely is value bet with Ace, maybe 9, maybe 8 (set? Actually set of 8s would be 8-8-8, but board has one 8, we have 8h, opponent could have 8x, making trips. That's strong). Could be a bluff? Possibly, but not many draws left.\n\nOur hand is just a pair of eights, which is likely behind Ace (A? ), behind 9, behind 8 trips, behind any two pair like A8? Actually board has Ace and 8, we have 8, so we have two pair? No, board has Ace high, we have pair of eights, not two pair. Opponent could have Ace with any kicker, giving top pair Ace, which beats us. Also could have 9 for pair of 9s, which beats us. Could have 8 for set (trips). Could have 6 for pair of six"

No, set of Kings would be three Kings, we have two Kings, board has no King, so we have pair of Kings, not set. Board is paired tens, so there is a potential full house for opponent with Ten, or trips for opponent with a Ten. Also we have overpair to board (Kings over Tens). Also possible straight draws? Board: T,2,T, so no straight draws.\n\nOur hand: K K, overpair, good but board is paired, risk of opponent having a full house (e.g., TT, T? Actually they could have a Ten for trips, or could have a pocket pair like 2-2 for trips, or could have a set of tens if they have T? Actually there are two tens on board, so any Ten gives trips. Also any 2 gives trips (2-2). Also any pair in hand could give full house if board pairs? Actually board already paired, so any pocket pair would give full house? If opponent has pocket pair not matching board, they'd have a set? No, board has two tens, so a pocket pair of something else (e.g., 9-9) would be just a pair, not set. But they could have 2-2 => trips of 2s, full house? Actually board: T T 2. If opponent has 2-2, they have three 2s (two in hand + one on board) and two tens on board => full house 2s over Ts? Wait board has two tens, one 2. So they have two 2s in hand + board 2 = three 2s, plus board has two tens, so they have a full house: 2s over Ts. Similarly if they have T-T, they'd have quads? Actually they'd have four tens (two on board + two in hand) => quads.\n\nThus many possible strong hands.\n\nWe are in BB, after preflop raise 30 (re-raise) and opponent called. So opponent (Seat 2) has 161 chips, presumably UTG? Actually seat 2 is after seat1 (SB). Seat 2 is in position? Seat order: SB seat1, BB seat5, seat2 is UTG? So seat2 is under the gun (first to act preflop). They raised to 12 then we 3-bet to 30, they called. So they likely have a strong hand.\n\nNow flop: we are first to act? Actually action order after flop: SB is out (folded), BB (us) acts first? In Texas Hold'em, after flop, action starts with first active player left of button, which is SB if still in, else BB. So we act first.\n\nWe have pot 64, we have 30 in pot? Actually preflop: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, raise to 12 (seat2), we 3-bet to 30 (so we added 30-4=26? Actually we posted 30 total). Then seat2 called 18 (to match 30). So pot after preflop: SB 2 + BB 4 + seat2 12 + us 30 + seat2 18 = 66? Let's compute: SB 2, BB 4, seat2 initial raise 12, we 30, seat2 call 18. Total = 2+4+12+30+18 = 66. But the given pot is 64, maybe small rounding. Anyway pot ~64.\n\nNow flop: we can check or raise. Opponent likely has a strong hand given 3-bet preflop. Could be AK, AQ, AA, KK, etc. With board T T 2, our K K is overpair, good but board paired.\n\nWe need to consider opponent range: preflop they raised, we 3-bet, they called. Their calling range could be: strong hands that like to call 3-bet: TT, JJ, 99, AK, AQ, maybe AJs, KQs, etc. Also some suited connectors maybe. But they are first to act preflop, they may be tight.\n\nNow flop with T T 2: If they have TT, they'd have quads (very strong). If they have 2x, they'd have trips. If they have a set of something else? No.\n\nIf they have AK, they have overpair (K) but board is paired, they have K? Actually they have AK, they'd have a King, so also overpair but they have Ace kicker, not relevant.\n\nOur hand is strong but vulnerable.\n\nWe could check and see what they do. If they bet,"

We have KKs, so currently we have top pair (K) but board is TT, we have overpair? Actually we have KKs, board TT2, we have overpair (Kings) but board has a pair of tens, so we have a set? No, we have no ten, so we have overpair to the board pair (tens). The opponent could have a ten (makes trips) or a full house (if they have a ten plus a ten? impossible) or a hand like AK (makes top pair K with top kicker). Actually we have KK, opponent could have TT (makes set). Could have T? Actually they could have a 2 for a full house? board 2s, they could have 2? That would be trips 2s, not full house. Or they could have a hand like Kx (makes pair of K, but we have KK). So we are ahead of any hand except a set of tens or a full house (if they have a T plus something else). Also a straight? board has T,2,T, no straight possibilities. So opponent's bet 30 into pot 94. Pot before bet: 94. They bet 30, making pot 124 after bet (if we call). They bet ~0.32 pot. That's a small bet, maybe they are probing with a weak hand or they have a draw? But there are no draws (board is paired tens, only possible draw is a backdoor flush? No clubs or hearts? Actually suits unknown. Could be flush draw if they have two clubs and board has clubs? board: Td (diamonds?), 2s (spades), Ts (diamonds). So there are two diamonds on board (Td, Ts). So a flush draw would need two diamonds in hand. That's possible. So they could have a diamond draw, but they bet small maybe to set price. Also they could have a ten (set) and want to protect, but they'd bet larger perhaps. Could be a weak hand like a gutshot? Not many.\n\nOur stack 164, opponent stack unknown? Not given but they have 131 chips initially. After preflop they have 131 - (call 18 + bet 30?) Actually they posted 2? Wait they are Seat2 (UTG?) They posted SB? Actually seat2 is not small blind; seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Actually preflop actions: seat5 post_sb 2 (so seat5 posted small blind). seat1 post_bb 4 (so seat1 posted big blind). So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So seat2 is UTG? Actually seat2 raised 12 (so raise to 12). So seat2 is the raiser. So seat2's stack after preflop: they raised to 12 (they put 12 total, including posting? They posted nothing before). Then seat5 (SB) raised to 30 (so they put 30 total). seat2 called 18 more (since they already put 12, they need to add 18 to match 30). So now pot: SB 2+30? Actually SB posted 2, then raised to 30, so total SB contribution = 30 (includes the 2). BB posted 4 and folded. So contributions: seat2: 12+18=30, seat5:30. So pot = 60. But pot listed as 94? Hmm maybe there were antes or other players? Actually seat1 had 189 chips folded, but posted big blind 4 and folded preflop, that adds 4 to pot. So pot = 30+30+4=64. Not 94. Something off. But anyway.\n\nNow flop bet 30. Our stack 164, opponent stack maybe around 131 - 30 = 101? Actually they have 131 chips initially, they put 30 preflop, leaving 101. So they bet 30, leaving 71. So we can call 30, leaving 134.\n\nDecision: With KK over TT, we are ahead of most hands except set. Opponent's bet is small, could be a draw or a weak hand. Should we raise? Could we extract value? Raising to 60 (minimum) would be 30 more, making pot bigger. But opponent might fold weaker hands. Since we have strong hand, we can consider raising to protect against draws, but the board is paired, so a raise also builds pot. Opponent could have a ten (set) and would likely call or raise.

The actions listed are up to flop. Now it's turn, and amount to call is 0, min raise 30, legal actions: fold, check, raise. We need to decide.\n\nWe have Ks Kh, pocket kings. Board: T\u2663? Actually Td (ten diamonds?), 2s (two spades), Ts (ten spades), 3s (three spades). So board has two tens, a 2, a 3, with three spades (2s, Ts, 3s). So there is a possible flush draw (spades). Also a possible full house draw for opponent (if they have a ten, they'd have trips, but we have kings). Opponent (Seat 2) raised preflop to 12, we 3-bet to 30, they called. Flop: we checked, they bet 30, we raised to 60, they called. So pot now after flop: Let's compute: Preflop: blinds 2+4 =6, plus raise 12 (to 12?), Actually seat2 raise to 12 (so they put 12 total?), seat5 raise to 30 (so they put 30 total). So preflop pot: 2+4+12+30 =48? plus seat2 call 18 (to match 30) adds 18, seat5 already 30, seat1 folded. So preflop pot = 48 + 18 =66? Wait compute: SB 2, BB 4, raise to 12 means seat2 puts 12 total (so additional 10 beyond BB). Then seat5 raise to 30 (so adds 26 beyond 4). So contributions: seat2 12, seat5 30, seat1 4 (BB). So total = 2+4+12+30 =48. Then seat2 call 18 to match 30, adds 18, so total =66. Yes preflop pot 66.\n\nFlop: board 4 cards? Actually flop is three cards: Td 2s Ts. We check, seat2 bets 30, we raise to 60 (so we put 60 total, additional 30 beyond 30). So seat2 calls 30. So contributions: seat2 bet 30, we raise 60 (so we added 60), seat2 call 30. So total added = 30+60+30 =120. Pot now = 66+120 =186. The given pot before turn is 184 chips, close enough maybe rounding.\n\nNow turn: unknown card. We have K\u2660? Actually we have Ks Kh (king spade and king heart). So we have a pair of kings, overpair to board (board currently has tens). Also we have a backdoor flush draw? We have spade king, board has 2s, Ts, 3s; we have one spade (Ks). So we have 4 spades total after turn if turn is spade, giving us flush draw? Actually we have 4 spades (Ks + three on board) = 4, need one more spade on river for flush. So backdoor flush draw.\n\nOpponent's range: preflop raise then call 3-bet, so they likely have strong hands: maybe broadway, suited connectors, pocket pairs, etc. On flop, they bet 30 into pot 66 (approx 0.45 pot). We raised, they called. That suggests they have decent hand, maybe top pair, overpair, set, two pair, straight draw, flush draw, etc.\n\nBoard: T T 2 3 (two spades). Opponent could have a hand like AT (top pair), TT (set), 33 (set), 23 (straight), 44 (maybe), 55, 66, 77, 88, 99 (overpair), AK, AQ, etc. They could also have spade draws: A\u2660? etc.\n\nWe have overpair Kings, which is strong but vulnerable to sets (TT, 33, 22? Actually board has 2, not a pair). There's a set of tens possible. Also possible straight draws: 9-8, 8-7, 7-6, 6-5? Actually board T T 2 3: straight possibilities: A K Q J? No. The board is paired tens, low cards. Straight combos: 9-8? No because need 4 cards in sequence. 9-8-7? Not possible. So only straight is maybe A K Q J 10? Not possible. So no straight draw.\n\nThus main threat is set of"

          "content": "We need to decide action. Turn card unknown, but we need to decide based on typical play. With overpair kings, pot is 184, stack 104 (26 BB). We are short stacked relative to pot? Actually stack 104, pot 184, we are slightly less than pot, but still have 104 chips left (including our already invested? Actually stack after flop: we had 104 start, we invested 30 preflop, 60 on flop raise = 30 extra? Actually we raised to 60, meaning we put total 60 on flop, which is 30 more than call. So we invested total 30 (preflop) + 60 = 90. So remaining stack = 104 - 90 = 14? Wait that seems off. Let's compute correctly: Starting stack 104. Preflop we posted 2 (SB) and then raised to 30 total, meaning we added 28 more? Actually we posted 2, then raise to 30 means total contribution 30, so we added 28 additional chips. So after preflop, our stack = 104 - 30 = 74.\n\nFlop: we checked (no chips), opponent bet 30, we raise to 60 total (so we put 60 total into pot on flop). We had already 30 in pot, so we add 30 more. So after flop, our stack = 74 - 30 = 44.\n\nThus we have 44 chips left. Pot is 184 (including our contributions). So we are short stack relative to pot, but still have 44 chips.\n\nNow turn: amount to call 0, min raise 30, legal actions fold, check, raise. We can raise up to our stack (44). Minimum raise is 30, so we could raise to 30 (i.e., add 30 more). That would be a raise to total bet of 30? Actually amount to call is 0, so raise to 30 means we bet 30 chips. That would be a continuation bet.\n\nGiven we have 44 chips left, raising to 30 is possible, leaving us 14 chips behind (potential all-in later). Could also go all-in for 44.\n\nConsider opponent's likely range: they called our flop raise, so they may have a hand like TT (set), or maybe a strong top pair like AT, KT, QT, etc. Our overpair kings is strong but vulnerable to TT set. If opponent has TT, they'd have set and would likely bet/raise. They bet 30 on flop, we raised, they called. If they have set, they'd likely raise on turn if board pairs again? But board currently has two tens, so set is already there. Turn could be another ten (making quads) or something else.\n\nIf turn is a low card, we might want to protect our kings by betting. Our stack is short, so we could go all-in now to protect. Opponent's stack is 101 chips originally, after flop they have contributed: preflop 12, flop 30+30=60, total 72. So they have 101-72=29 chips left. Actually they have 101 chips total at start, they put 12 preflop, 30 bet, 30 call = 72, leaving 29. So opponent is short stacked too! Wait they have 101 chips initially, after flop they have 29 left. So both are short.\n\nThus we both are short and near the bubble? Anyway, we have 44 left, opponent 29 left. So on turn, opponent can only call up to 29. If we bet 30, they cannot call full, they'd have to go all-in for 29. So we could raise all-in for 44, they can call all-in for 29 (they are short). That would be a push.\n\nGiven pot 184, we have 44 left, opponent 29 left. If we go all-in, we risk 44 to win pot 184 + opponent's 29 = 213? Actually pot will be 184 + 44 (our bet) + 29 (opponent call) = 257. So we risk 44 to win 257, ~5.8:1. That's good if we think we are ahead > 15% equity. With Ks Kh vs opponent's range (including TT set, maybe AK, AQ, AT, KQ, etc.), our equity maybe around 70% vs many combos, but set TT would beat us. Set TT probability given they called preflop and flop raise: they could have TT (3 combos left after we have KK). They could also have 33 (but board has 3). Actually board has 3s, so 33 set possible but they would have 33 (2 combos). They could have 22 (pair of 2s)"

Opponents: Seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) SB 2 chips, Seat2 (Kimi-K2) BB 4 chips. Both short stacks? Kimi-K2 has 97 chips, Kimi-K2 Thinking has 187 chips. Both are relatively short relative to 72BB but still have decent. Their raise tendencies: from recall, seat2 (Kimi-K2) raised preflop amounts 6,12 in prior hands (hand numbers 16 and 24). Seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised 14 in hand 17. So they sometimes raise. But currently they have not acted yet. We are facing just the BB's 4 (call). Actually SB posted 2, BB posted 4. The amount to call is 4 (to match BB). So we could call 4, raising to 8 min. With 8-5 off, calling is cheap and we could see flop. But we risk being out of position later (we are BTN, after flop we are first to act? Actually BTN is last preflop, after flop will be first to act (under the gun) because SB and BB are still in. So position is disadvantage postflop. So maybe folding is best.\n\nGiven hand is weak, short stack opponents may try to steal. We could raise to attempt steal, but 8-5 is not good for raise. Better fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

In heads-up, the dealer is SB and acts first preflop, then BB acts second. But we have SB posted by seat4, but seat4 folded. So we are BB vs UTG who called. So after preflop, the action on flop will be to the caller (seat3) first, then us (BB). So we are out of position. With 6c9h, it's a weak hand, likely fold. But we already posted BB. The amount to call is 0, we can check. Should we check? If we check, we see flop cheap, could see a cheap flop. But 6c9h is a speculative hand with limited potential. In tournament with 69.5 BB, preserving stack is important. Against a single opponent who called from early position (tight?), we might want to fold if we think they have a better hand. But checking is safe: we see flop for free. Could be okay.\n\nCheck vs raise? We can raise to 8 minimum. Raising with 6c9h is not advisable.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Board: 7c Th Ac. Our hand 6c 9h. So we have gutshot straight draw? Actually board has 7,10,A. Our hole cards 6 and 9 give us an open-ended straight draw? Let's see possible straights: 6-7-8-9-10 would be straight if we have 8, but we have 6 and 9, board has 7,10. So we have 6-7-8-9-10 missing 8. Also 9-10-J-Q-K? Not. So we have gutshot: need 8 to complete 6-7-8-9-10. Also we have backdoor flush draw? We have 6c and board has 7c, so one club on board, we have club, need two more clubs on turn and river for flush. Not strong.\n\nWe have no pair. So currently just gutshot and backdoor flush. Not much.\n\nOpponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) called preflop 4 (small blind). So they have some hand, maybe decent. On flop, they haven't acted yet (they are the only opponent left). It's their turn after us? Actually order: SB folded, BB checked, then UTG? Actually seat 3 is UTG? But they are after BB? Preflop they called. Now flop, action goes to seat 3 first (since they are earlier in order?). Usually after flop, first active player left of button? In BB, the flop action starts with first player left of button (SB) if still in. SB folded, so next is seat 3 (UTG). So they act first. So we are after them. So we have amount to call 0, meaning they have checked? Actually we don't know their action yet. The state shows amount to call 0, meaning it's our turn and no bet yet. So they must have checked. So we can check or raise.\n\nGiven weak hand, we should probably check. Raise would be a bluff. Could be okay if we think they are weak. But we have limited stack 278, pot 10, raising to minimum 4 (i.e., raise to 4 total? Actually raise to total amount 4? Minimum raise to 4 meaning raise amount? Usually min raise is 4, meaning you put total 4? But we already have 0 to call, so raising to 4 puts 4 chips in. That's small.\n\nGiven we have a gutshot, maybe we can try to semi-bluff raise to apply pressure. Opponent's stack 153, they could fold many hands. However tournament considerations: we have decent stack (69 BB) and opponent 153 (38 BB). We could try to steal pot. But risk: if they call, we are left with a weak draw. Pot odds: If we raise 4, pot becomes 14, they call 4, pot 18, we have 2 outs (8). Actually we have 4 outs? Straight draw: need 8. There are four 8s, but one may be on board? No 8 on board. So 4 outs. Also flush draw: need two clubs, but only one more club needed for flush? Actually we have 6c, board has 7c, need two more clubs for flush, so need two clubs on turn and river, not immediate. So only straight outs 4. Chance to hit on turn or river about 8% (4/47 + 4/46). So not great. So a raise may be unprofitable if called.\n\nBetter to check and see turn. So action: check.\n\nThus JSON.",

Let's see: possible straight combos: 8-9-10-J-Q? Not relevant. With 6-9 we have 6-7-8-9-10? We need 8 to complete 6-7-8-9-10 straight. That's a gutshot (need 8). Also we have backdoor flush draws? We have clubs 6c, board has 7c, Ac. That's two clubs, we have one club, need two more clubs. Not strong.\n\nWe have Ace high, but board has Ace, so we have pair of Aces (board). Our hand does not improve; we have Ace high (kicker 9). Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 6 into pot 16, so pot will be 22 after call. Pot odds: need to call 6 to win 22 (including call) = 6/(22) = ~27% needed. Our equity with gutshot? With 8 outs (four 8s) plus maybe some combos for runner-runner flush? But primary outs: 8 outs for straight. Also two clubs? Actually we have 6c, board clubs: 7c, Ac. So we have a flush draw? Need two more clubs, but we only have one club, need two clubs on turn and river. That's not immediate. So outs maybe 8. Probability to hit on turn or river: about 15% (8/47 \u224817% for turn, plus if miss then 8/46 \u224817% for river, combined ~30%). So equity maybe ~30% against a single opponent's bet. Pot odds 27% so call is marginally profitable. Consider opponent's tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 flop bet amounts 8 and 5 in previous hands. Those are small bets relative to pot. Could be continuation bet with weak hand, maybe they have Ace or something. Our hand is weak. Could also consider raising? Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise to 12 total). That would be 6 more. Not much. Raising could be a bluff? But we have little equity if called. Could raise to try to take pot now, but likely opponent will call with Ace or better.\n\nGiven stack depth 278, we can afford call. I think call is correct.\n\nThus action: call.",

Board: 7,10,A. So we have gutshot? 6-7-8-9-10 would be straight, missing 8. So we have 6 and 9, we have 6-7-8-9-10 straight draw needs 8. Not present. Also we have pair? No. So we have just 6-high, no pair. The board has Ace high. We have backdoor flush? We have club 6c, so we have four clubs? Actually we have 6c, board clubs: 7c, Ac, 4c = three clubs. So we have four clubs total (6c + three board) = four clubs, we have a flush draw (needs any club). So we have a nut flush draw? The Ace of clubs is on board, so the nut flush is Ace-high flush, but we have 6c, so we would have 6-high flush if hits, but Ace is on board, so any club would give us a flush with Ace high? Actually flush ranking: highest card determines. Since board has Ace of clubs, any flush will have Ace high, regardless of our club. So we cannot make a higher flush than board; but board already has Ace, so any club on turn/river will give everyone a flush with Ace high. So we have a flush draw but not the nut? Actually it's the nut flush because the Ace is on board, so the best possible flush is Ace-high, which is already on board; we cannot have a higher flush than board; but if a club hits, the board will have four clubs including Ace, making the best hand a flush with Ace high; all players with a club will share same flush; but we could have a higher kicker? Flush ranking uses highest cards in hand beyond board? For flush, you consider the best five clubs. If board has Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten clubs, that's straight flush; but here board only has Ace, 7, 4 clubs. If a club hits, we will have five clubs: Ace, 7, 4, 6, X. Our kicker is 6. If opponent has Kc, they'd have Ace, K, 7, 4, X (maybe). So we could be outdrawn. So it's not the nut flush.\n\nWe are on turn. The pot is 22. Opponent (Seat 3) DeepSeek-V3.2 bet? Actually actions: flop: seat3 bet 6, seat5 call 6. So after flop, pot 22? Wait preflop pot: 2+4+4 =10? Actually preflop: SB 2, BB 4, call 4 by seat3, so pot 2+4+4 =10. Flop: seat5 check, seat3 bet 6, seat5 call 6. So pot now: 10+6+6 =22. Yes.\n\nNow turn: board adds a card (unknown from description). Actually we have turn card not shown. Wait board: 7c Th Ac 4c. That's 4 cards, so turn is 4c. So turn card is 4c (club). So board now: clubs: 7c, Ac, 4c. So we have flush draw now 4 clubs.\n\nNow it's our turn? Actually after flop, seat3 bet 6, we called. Now turn action: Who acts first? Usually the player left of dealer (SB) acts first preflop, then after flop, the first active player left of dealer acts first. Seat 3 is DeepSeek, seat5 is us. Who is seat? Seats: seat1 Kimi, seat2 Kimi, seat3 DeepSeek, seat4 MiniMax folded, seat5 us. Dealer? Not given. But we are BB, seat5. The SB is seat4 (post_sb 2) but folded preflop. So after flop, the first active player left of dealer? If dealer is seat? Not given. But actions show flop: seat5 check first, then seat3 bet. So seat5 acted first on flop. So on turn, seat5 acts first again? Likely yes. So now it's our turn on turn, amount to call is 0 (since no bet yet). Minimum raise to 6 (pot 22? Actually minimum raise is size of previous bet? Usually it's at least the size of the bet on that street, which was 6. So raise to 6? Actually raise to at least pot? The minimum raise is previous bet amount plus"

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #33 turn. We are BB with 6c 9h. Board: 7c Th Ac 4c. So board shows a flush draw (clubs) with three clubs (7c, Ac, 4c). Also a straight draw? Cards: 6,9. Board: 7,10,A. So we have gutshot? 6-7-8-9-10 would be straight, missing 8. So we have 6 and 9, we have 6-7-8-9-10 straight draw needs 8. Not present. Also we have pair? No. So we have just 6-high, no pair. The board has Ace high. We have backdoor flush? We have club 6c, so we have four clubs? Actually we have 6c, board clubs: 7c, Ac, 4c = three clubs. So we have four clubs total (6c + three board) = four clubs, we have a flush draw (needs any club). So we have a nut flush draw? The Ace of clubs is on board, so the nut flush is Ace-high flush, but we have 6c, so we would have 6-high flush if hits, but Ace is on board, so any club would give us a flush with Ace high? Actually flush ranking: highest card determines. Since board has Ace of clubs, any flush will have Ace high, regardless of our club. So we cannot make a higher flush than board; but board already has Ace, so any club on turn/river will give everyone a flush with Ace high. So we have a flush draw but not the nut? Actually it's the nut flush because the Ace is on board, so the best possible flush is Ace-high, which is already on board; we cannot have a higher flush than board; but if a club hits, the board will have four clubs including Ace, making the best hand a flush with Ace high; all players with a club will share same flush; but we could have a higher kicker? Flush ranking uses highest cards in hand beyond board? For flush, you consider the best five clubs. If board has Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten clubs, that's straight flush; but here board only has Ace, 7, 4 clubs. If a club hits, we will have five clubs: Ace, 7, 4, 6, X. Our kicker is 6. If opponent has Kc, they'd have Ace, K, 7, 4, X (maybe). So we could be outdrawn. So it's not the nut flush.\n\nWe are on turn. The pot is 22. Opponent (Seat 3) DeepSeek-V3.2 bet? Actually actions: flop: seat3 bet 6, seat5 call 6. So after flop, pot 22? Wait preflop pot: 2+4+4 =10? Actually preflop: SB 2, BB 4, call 4 by seat3, so pot 2+4+4 =10. Flop: seat5 check, seat3 bet 6, seat5 call 6. So pot now: 10+6+6 =22. Yes.\n\nNow turn: board adds a card (unknown from description). Actually we have turn card not shown. Wait board: 7c Th Ac 4c. That's 4 cards, so turn is 4c. So turn card is 4c (club). So board now: clubs: 7c, Ac, 4c. So we have flush draw now 4 clubs.\n\nNow it's our turn? Actually after flop, seat3 bet 6, we called. Now turn action: Who acts first? Usually the player left of dealer (SB) acts first preflop, then after flop, the first active player left of dealer acts first. Seat 3 is DeepSeek, seat5 is us. Who is seat? Seats: seat1 Kimi, seat2 Kimi, seat3 DeepSeek, seat4 MiniMax folded, seat5 us. Dealer? Not given. But we are BB, seat5. The SB is seat4 (post_sb 2) but folded preflop. So after flop, the first active player left of dealer? If dealer is seat? Not given. But actions show flop: seat5 check first, then seat3 bet. So seat5 acted first on flop. So on turn, seat5 acts first again? Likely yes. So now it's our turn on turn, amount to call is 0 (since no bet yet). Minimum raise to 6 (pot 22? Actually minimum raise is size of previous bet? Usually it's at least the size of the bet on that street, which was 6. So raise to 6? Actually raise to at least pot? The minimum raise is previous bet amount plus",

          "reasoning_content": "Need to decide action. We have a flush draw with 4 clubs, plus maybe straight draw? 6c 9h gives open-ended? Not open. So about 9 outs for flush (13 clubs total, we have 1, board 3, so remaining 9). Also maybe a gutshot 8 for straight (needs 8). That's 4 outs (four 8s). Some overlap with clubs (8c counted already). So total outs approx 12? Actually 8c is both flush and straight, but that's fine. So about 12 outs. Turn to river: two cards left. Approx equity ~ 12*2/47 = ~51%? Actually using approximate: 12 outs, chance to hit by river = 1 - ( (39/47)*(38/46) ) = about 1 - (0.8298*0.8261) = 1 - 0.685 = 0.315. So ~31% chance to improve. Not great.\n\nOpponent just called our flop call, so they likely have something like Ace high, maybe pair, maybe draw. Their bet on flop was 6 into pot 10 (post-flop pot 10). That's a small bet, maybe they have a hand like Ace, or a draw, or a weak pair. They called our call, indicating they are okay.\n\nNow turn: board 4c adds another club, giving opponent also a club draw? They may have clubs. They might have Aces. Our hand is weak. We have 272 chips, stack decent. Pot 22. No bet yet. We can check or bet/raise. Considering our equity ~31% and pot odds if they bet. If we bet, we could represent a strong hand (maybe Ace). But we have no pair. Might be okay to check and see river. If we check, opponent may bet; we can decide then.\n\nCheck is legal (amount to call 0). Raising is also legal but we need raise_to at least 6 (minimum raise). Should we raise? Probably not, as we have weak hand.\n\nThus choose \"check\".",

Our hand has 6c, so we have four clubs total, need one more club for flush. So we have a flush draw (any club). Also straight possibilities: board has A, T, 7, 4. Our hand 6,9 gives possible straight draw? We have 6,9. Combine with board: 4-5-6-7-8? Not there. Could get 8? Not. 9-10-J-Q-K? Not. So only flush draw.\n\nOpponent (Seat 3) DeepSeek-V3.2 bet 12 on turn after we checked. Preflop they called 4 (so they have something). Flop they bet 6, we called. So they are showing aggression.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: Opponent has 135 chips left. Pot currently 34 + 6 (flop bet) + 6 call = 46? Wait pot after flop: Preflop pot: 4 (bb) + 4 (call) = 8? Actually preflop: seat5 posted bb 4, seat3 called 4 => pot 8. Flop: seat5 check, seat3 bet 6, seat5 call 6 => pot adds 12, total pot 20. Turn: seat5 check, seat3 bet 12 => pot will be 32 after call. So currently pot before turn bet: 20. Opponent bets 12, making pot 32 if called.\n\nOur stack: 272, opponent 135. So we have deep stack.\n\nWe need to decide: call, raise, or fold. We have a flush draw with 4 outs? Actually clubs left: clubs in deck: 13 total, board has 3 clubs, we have 1 club = 4 clubs accounted. Remaining clubs = 9. But one of those clubs is the Ace? Already on board. So we have 9 clubs left. However some may be dead (opponent may hold clubs). So approximate outs = 9. Turn to river: we have one card to hit. Probability ~ 9/46 = 19.6% chance to hit on river.\n\nPot odds: To call 12 to win pot of 32 (including opponent's bet). Actually pot after call will be 20 + 12*2 = 44? Let's compute: pot before turn bet = 20. Opponent bets 12, we call 12, pot becomes 44. So we call 12 to potentially win 44. Pot odds = 12/44 = 27.3% required. Our equity ~ 20% (if just flush draw). Not enough. However we also have straight possibilities? Not. So call is negative expected value.\n\nWe could raise to make them fold if they are weak. But they are betting again, maybe they have a strong hand (maybe Ace high, pair, etc). They may have Ace (board has Ace).

Might be a mistake: Actually seat5 is SB, but they said BB. We'll follow given: Our position BB (maybe they treat seat5 as BB). Regardless, we are facing a bet of 2 (to call). The big blind posted 4, we posted 2 as SB, so amount to call is 2 (to complete BB). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total). Hand: A4 offsuit (4h Ac). Stack 270, deep.\n\nWe need decide fold/call/raise. A4 offsuit is weak but can be played from BB vs a single raise? The opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking, who has raised preflop in previous hands (hand numbers 6,11,17,26,30) with amounts 8-14 (so 2-3.5x BB). Likely they are raising with a range of strong hands, maybe some suited connectors, etc. Our A4 offsuit is marginal. In BB, against a raise, typical play is to fold weak offsuit aces like A4o unless you have good implied odds and deep stacks. Stack is 67.5 BB, deep. However tournament stage unknown. Likely we should call to see flop because we have A-high and potential wheel? Actually 4h gives us a straight draw possibilities (A-2-3-4-5) but need 2 and 3. Not great.\n\nWe could also raise to isolate but risk.\n\nGiven opponent's raise pattern (maybe they raise with a wide range?), but we have limited info. Usually A4o is not a raise from BB vs raise. So call is reasonable.\n\nAmount to call 2 is small relative to stack, pot will be 8 after call (4+2+2). So we can call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

That seems contradictory: seat5 is BB but they posted sb? Possibly they are in SB? Actually blinds: 2/4, seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? But actions show seat5 post_sb 2 (so seat5 is SB), seat1 post_bb 4 (seat1 is BB). So maybe seat5 is SB? But position says BB (Seat5). Might be mismatch. Regardless, we are in small blind (or BB). After posting sb, seat1 posts bb, then others fold, seat5 call 2 (completing sb to bb?), then seat1 raise 12 (to total 12? Actually raise amount is 12, meaning they raise to 12? The amount to call now is 8 (since they raised from 4 to 12, extra 8). Minimum raise to 20 (so raise must be at least to 20 total). Our stack 268, can raise.\n\nWe have Ace-4 offsuit. Not a premium hand. In early position? We're in SB vs raise from BB (seat1). The raise size is 12 total (so 3x big blind). Facing a raise from BB, we are out of position. Should we fold? Ace-4 offsuit is weak, especially out of position, and raise is not huge but still. With 67 BB, we can fold. Could consider 3-bet? Not advisable with A4o.

Actions: SB (seat2) posted 4, BB (seat3) posted 8, seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 16 (so raise 8 over BB). So we face 16 to call.\n\nWe need decide fold/call/raise. Hand: T9 unsuited (clubs and diamonds). In cutoff, with 34 BB, facing a raise of 2 BB (16 total). T9o is a marginal hand. Consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 has raised previously small amounts (4,4,4,12). So seems to be making small raises, maybe wide range? Could be a standard open raise. He raised to 16 (2BB). That's a standard open raise size. His range could be broad, but still includes many strong hands.\n\nOur hand T9o has some potential for straight draws, but not premium. In a tournament, with 34 BB, we could call to see flop, but also risk being dominated. Position is good (CO). We could also consider 3-betting? But raise to at least 24 (minimum raise). That's 3BB total? Actually raise to 24 means additional 8 over call? Minimum raise is 24 (so raise 8 more). That would be 3BB total (24). That's a small 3-bet, could be used as a bluff or to isolate. But given we have a marginal hand, 3-betting might be risky.\n\nWe could also fold and preserve stack.\n\nWe might want to call if we think we can outplay postflop and have implied odds. Stack depth 34 BB, not deep but enough.\n\nWe should also consider other players: Seats 1 and 2 still to act after us (since we are CO, seat5, next is seat1 (UTG?), seat2 (SB). So if we call, we may face more action.\n\nGiven hand strength, I think best is to fold. T9o is not strong enough to call a raise in cutoff with 34 BB, especially against a player who raises standard size. So fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have flop: Qc 2d Kd. Our hand: Qd 4s gives us top pair Qs with kicker 4, plus a gutshot? Actually board: Qc Kd 2d. We have Qd, so pair of queens, kicker 4, board also has K. Opponent seat1 (Kimi-K2) is in BB? Actually seat1 is BB with 151 chips. Seat5 is us (BB? Actually we are BB seat5, but seat1 is BB? Wait blinds: seat5 posted sb 8, seat1 posted bb 16. So seat1 is BB, seat5 is SB. So we are SB. Preflop we called 8, seat1 checked. So on flop, seat1 is acting first (since BB). The pot is 32. Action: amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. So we can check or raise. We need to decide.\n\nOur hand: top pair Q, but opponent may have K, A, Q, etc. Board is somewhat coordinated: a straight draw? 2-? Actually need 3-4-5 for straight, but we have 4. So we have gutshot straight draw (needs 3 or 5). Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Board has two diamonds (Qc, Kd, 2d). We have 4s, not diamond. So no flush draw.\n\nWe have ~14 BB stack, 226 chips. Opponent has 151 chips. So opponent is shorter stack. We have more chips, but still shortish.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, Kimi-K2 (seat1) has many folds preflop, occasional raises. On flop, only one recorded bet: hand 24, flop bet 30 (unknown board). So they sometimes bet on flop.\n\nGiven we have top pair but vulnerable to Kx, A, maybe also Qx with better kicker. Our kicker is weak. Might consider check-call if they bet? But we have no bet to call now; we can check or raise. Since we have top pair, we could try to protect by raising to extract value from worse hands (like K, J, 10, etc) or from draws. However we are out of position (SB vs BB? Actually after flop, action order: BB acts first, then SB. So we are out of position (SB). Raising out of position can be good to get value, but also can be risky if opponent has strong hand and raises again.\n\nOpponent stack is 151, pot 32, so they could shove all-in if they have strong hand. Minimum raise is 16 (to 16 total? Actually raise to 16 total? The pot is 32, min raise to 48? Wait: In NL Hold'em, min raise is amount of previous bet plus that amount. Since there is no bet, min raise is big blind amount (16). So raise to 16 total? Actually we have already contributed 8 (SB) and 16 (BB) preflop, pot 32 includes both. So min raise to 48? But they said minimum raise to: 16. That seems like raise amount relative to 0? Probably raise to 16 chips total added to pot? Might be ambiguous. But we just need to output raise_to number.\n\nWe can raise to e.g., 48 chips (i.e., 16 more). But we have to follow format.\n\nGiven opponent short stack, we might want to protect and maybe isolate. If we raise to about 80-100 chips, we can put pressure. But we must consider we have only 226 chips, opponent 151. If we raise to 100, opponent can call or shove. If they have a better hand (Kx, AQ, etc) they may call. If they have a draw, they may call hoping to hit.\n\nI think best is to raise to about 80 chips (approx 2.5x pot) to get value from worse hands and protect against draws. Since we are out of position, raising is good.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 80 (or maybe 96). Let's choose 80.\n\nReasoning: top pair, decent hand, opponent short stack, want value, protect.\n\n",

Wait: BB posted 16, raise to 80 means they put 80 total? In typical notation: raise to 80 means total bet 80, so they added 64 (80-16). So they are raising to 80 total.

Our stack 114, after calling would have 50 left. Pot currently 491, plus opponent bet 64 (makes pot 555), plus our call 64 would be 619 total pot. We would have 50 chips left, about 0.41 BB left?

Actually they raised 80 from presumably 80 stack? Not sure. But they are out of tournament, but still playing maybe all-in. They called flop bet. So they likely have a strong hand like Aces, Kings, etc. But they are all-in, cannot bet further. The turn bet is from seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) with 71 chips left. They bet 64, which is almost their stack. They might be bluffing or have strong hand. Our hand is marginal.\n\nWe should consider tournament: we have short stack 7.1 BB. Need to double up. Opponent has 71 chips (~4.4 BB). If we call and lose, we go down to 50 chips left, still alive but short. If we fold, we keep 114 chips, but may be stuck behind bigger stacks?

Usually preflop order: after blinds, action starts with UTG (first active left of BB). But here seat4 called, then SB acts last preflop. So we have to decide.\n\nWe have A\u2663? Actually Ad Js (Ace diamonds and Jack spades). In SB with 6.6 BB, short stack. Need to consider push/fold strategy. With 6.6 BB, typical push/fold range includes AJs? Yes AJs is a strong hand for push. The pot is 40, call amount 8 (to match BB). If we call, we would be putting 8 more, making pot 48 and we have 98 left. But raising to 32 (minimum raise) would be a raise of 24 more, total 32 from SB (including 8 already posted? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in, so raise to 32 means we add 24 more). That would be a raise of 2 BB (since big blind is 16). With 6.6 BB, raising to 32 is about 2 BB raise.\n\nGiven short stack, typical optimal is either go all-in (push) or fold, rarely call a raise. But here it's a call scenario: we could call 8 to see flop, but with 6.6 BB it's risky to see flop out of position. Better to push all-in? But legal actions: fold, call, raise. Raise to 32 is allowed, but that's not all-in; all-in would be 106. But raise_to can be any amount up to stack? Minimum raise 32. Could raise to all-in (106). That would be a shove.\n\nGiven we have AJs, a strong hand, and short stack, best is to shove all-in to maximize fold equity. Opponents have bigger stacks (127 and 402). They may call with wide ranges. So push.\n\nThus action: raise to 106 (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, strong hand, maximize equity.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed. So we raise to 106.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with Ad Js. Board: 7h Jd As. So we have top two pair (Aces and Jacks) with Ace kicker (actually we have A J, board A J 7, so we have two pair, Aces and Jacks, plus a 7 kicker). That's a very strong hand. Opponent is MiniMax-M2, with 312 chips. Our stack is 8 chips, which is 0.5 BB (tiny). The pot is 228 chips. We're in BB with 8 chips left, effectively short-stacked. The opponent has called our preflop raise? Let's see preflop: seat5 raise 106 (to 106?), seat4 call 90 (so they called 90). So preflop pot: small blind 8, big blind 16, seat4 call 90, seat5 raise 106 (so seat5 put 106 total?), seat4 call 90 (so they matched to 106? Actually raise to 106, so seat4 needed to call extra 90 (since they had already 16). So total contributions: seat5 106, seat4 106 (16 + 90), plus blinds 8+16 = 30? Wait small blind 8 (seat5 posted), big blind 16 (seat1 posted). Seat5 raise 106 (so adds 98 more?). Actually after posting SB 8, they raise to 106 total (i.e., they put 106 total). So they added 98 more. Seat1 posted BB 16 then folded preflop. Seat4 called 16 then called 90 to match 106. So pot after preflop: seat5 106, seat4 106, seat1 16, seat5's SB 8 counted already? Actually seat5's 106 includes the 8 SB? Probably yes: raise to 106 means total bet is 106, includes SB. So seat5 contributed 106, seat4 contributed 106, seat1 contributed 16, total pot = 228 (as given). Good.\n\nNow flop: board gives us two pair. Opponent's stack is huge relative to us. We have 8 chips left (including our 8 chips currently). Actually after preflop, we have 8 chips left (our stack). Wait we had 8 chips total at start? The stack line says \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\". So we are extremely short. We are essentially all-in already? But we posted 8 SB then raised to 106, meaning we must have had at least 106 chips. But the stack says 8 chips? Something inconsistent. Perhaps the stack shown is after posting SB? Actually typical: Stack is remaining after posting SB? In many poker logs, stack shows after posting blinds. So we posted SB 8, leaving 8 chips? That would be 16 total? Hmm.\n\nGiven the numbers: blinds are 8/16, pot is 228, we have 8 chips left (0.5 BB). That suggests we are indeed short stacked; we cannot bet more. The legal actions: fold, check. So we cannot raise. We can check (i.e., we are all-in already). So we just check. Reason: we have best hand likely, but cannot bet. So check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

So we have two pair: Aces (pair) and Jacks (pair). Actually we have Aces: As on board + Ad in hand = pair of Aces. Jacks: Jd on board + Js in hand = pair of Jacks. So we have two pair, Aces and Jacks. Board also has paired 7s (two 7s). So board is a full house? Wait board: 7h, Jd, As, 7s. That's two 7s, one J, one A. Not a full house. Our hand makes two pair. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) presumably has some hand. He called preflop raise, then checked flop. Now on turn, we need to act. The pot is 228, we have 8 chips total (0.5 BB). Actually our stack is 8 chips, we posted SB 8, posted BB 16? Wait we are BB seat5, posted 16. Preflop we raised to 106 (so we put 106 total? Actually raise to 106 means total bet 106, so we added 90 more after posting 16). So we have now contributed 106. Opponent called 90 more, so he also has 106 total. So pot after preflop is 212? Actually initial pot: blinds 8+16=24. Then raise to 106, call 90, so total pot = 24 + 106 + 90? Wait raise to 106 includes his 16? Let's compute: BB posted 16, SB posted 8. Then raise to 106 means BB puts 106 total, so adds 90. Then opponent calls 90 (since he posted 16 initially as big blind? Actually seat4 is not blind, he called 16 preflop (call big blind). So he put 16 initially, then call 90 to match raise. So his total contribution = 106. So total pot after preflop = 8+16+106+106 = 236? Wait 8+16=24, plus 106+106=212, total 236. But the hand info says pot: 228 chips. Slight discrepancy maybe due to rounding. Anyway.\n\nNow on turn, board adds 7s making paired board. Our stack is 8 chips left (0.5 BB). Actually we have 8 chips total stack after posting SB? Wait we posted SB 8 preflop, then raise to 106, that uses 106 total, but we only have 8 chips total stack? Something off. The description: \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" suggests we are short-stacked: we have only 8 chips total (including posted blind). The blinds are 8/16, so we have 0.5 BB (i.e., 8 chips). So we posted SB 8, then we are BB? Wait position says BB, seat5, but we posted SB 8 and BB 16? That seems contradictory. Possibly seat5 is BB, posted BB 16, but they also show preflop: Seat5 post_sb 8. So seat5 posted SB and also BB? Something weird. Maybe seat5 is small blind (SB) but they label position BB incorrectly. Regardless, we have only 8 chips total, which is the SB amount. So we cannot raise; only check or fold (or call if bet). The legal actions: fold, check. Amount to call: 0. So we can check.\n\nGiven we have a strong hand (two pair top), but we are short stacked and cannot bet. Checking is fine. Could we go all-in? No, we have no chips left to bet (we have 8 chips but we already invested? Actually we have 8 total, but we have already invested 106? That cannot be. Something inconsistent. Likely the stack is after posting blinds, we have 8 chips left to act, meaning we are effectively all-in already? Actually if we have 8 chips left, we cannot raise. So checking is the only option.\n\nThus action: check. Reasoning: short stack, cannot raise, hand is strong but cannot bet, checking to see showdown.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Might be okay to limp? Actually it's a raise? The BB posted 16, we posted SB 8, then we need to call 8 to match BB. That's a standard raise from BB? Actually the BB is a raise of 16 (post). So we can call 8 to see flop. 3K is a decent hand? Off-suit K3 is not great, but could be okay to call in SB vs BB with deep stacks? But stack is shallow 12.8 BB. I think folding is reasonable.

Ah3s is weak, but with short stack you may consider shove to steal blinds. However UTG early position, weak hand, likely not good. But you have 12.8 BB, you could consider a limp (call 16) then maybe get raised later. But calling 16 leaves you with 188 behind, still short. Might be better to go all-in to apply pressure, but risk being called by larger stacks. Opponent Kimi-K2 is seat 2 (SB) with 205 chips, similar stack. He has raised previously varying amounts, sometimes big (157). He seems aggressive preflop. Could be willing to call an all-in. But Ah3s is very weak; against his range, likely not good.

          "reasoning_content": "We have Jd6d in BB, opponent (seat2) raised to 48 (from 16 blind). So raise size 48 total, meaning they put 48 chips total (they are in SB? Actually seat1 posted SB 8, seat5 posted BB 16. Seat2 is UTG? Not important). They raised to 48, so they added 32 chips (since big blind 16). So raise is relatively small, about 3x big blind. Our stack is 180, 11.2 BB, short stack. J6 suited is a speculative hand, not great for a raise. In BB, facing a raise of 48, call would be 40 to see flop. Pot after call would be 72 + 40 =112? Actually pot currently 72 (SB+BB+raise). If we call, pot becomes 112. Our stack after call would be 140. Is J6d a hand we want to call? In short stack, we might consider either shove all-in or fold. Raising to 80 would be min raise (increase total to 80). That would be 64 more chips, total stack 180-64=116 left. That's not an all-in. With J6 suited, not a good raise. Better to fold or call? With 11 BB, often you push or fold, but you can also call to see flop if implied odds good. J6 suited can flop a straight draw or flush, but limited.\n\nOpponent's raise size 48 is relatively small, perhaps they are trying to steal. Their raise history: they have raised amounts 12,16,24,157,40. So they vary; recent raise 40 (hand 72) similar to this. No clear pattern.\n\nGiven we have 11 BB, maybe we should go all-in? But our hand is weak. All-in could be risky, but short stack may need to pick spots. J6 suited is not a typical all-in candidate; better to fold.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\n",

Let's see: possible straight: Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace. We have Q T, missing J and maybe? Actually we have Ten and Queen, board has King Ace, missing Jack. Need J and also need? Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace is straight, we have Ten and Queen, board provides King Ace, need Jack. That's one card needed, but also need? The straight would be Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace, we have Ten and Queen, need Jack, plus need? That's only one missing card, but we need 5 cards: we have T, Q, K, A, need J. So it's a gutshot (one card) not open-ended. Also we have backdoor flush draw: hearts: we have Qh, board has 5h, need two more hearts. So potential.\n\nOur hand currently: Qh Ts, board Kd 5h Ad. No pair, no made hand. We have gutshot straight draw (J) and backdoor flush.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 56 into pot 144. That's about 0.39 pot. Small bet, maybe a continuation bet or a probe. He has 216 chips, big stack relative to us (148). He could be betting with a wide range: any Ace, K, maybe draws, etc.\n\nOur stack: 148, we have 56 to call, raise min 112 (so raise to 112 total). Our effective stack is 148, we could raise to 112 (leaving us 36 behind). Could also go all-in 148.\n\nWe need to consider tournament context: we have 9.2 BB, short stack. We need to pick up chips, but also preserve. We're BTN, we raised preflop to 32 (2x BB) from 148, so we were raising. Opponent called. So opponent likely has a range of hands that call a 2x raise from BTN: could be broadway, pairs, suited connectors, etc.\n\nNow flop is K A 5. Our raise preflop with Q T is a bit speculative but okay.\n\nNow opponent bets small. Options: call, raise (maybe all-in), fold. Considering we are short stack, maybe we could shove all-in? But raise to 112 is still less than all-in. However, a raise to 112 might be seen as a semi-bluff, but we have a gutshot and backdoor flush; not strong enough to commit.\n\nOur equity vs opponent's range? Opponent likely has many combos that beat us: Aces (A?), K, maybe also draws. Our chance to improve on turn or river is limited: need J for straight (4 outs) plus maybe hearts for flush (2 more outs after turn). So about 6 outs total, ~12% per street. Not great.\n\nGiven we have 9 BB, we could consider a shove to try to double up. But we have only 148 chips, and opponent has 216, so we would be short-stack vs bigger stack. If we shove all-in (148) we risk losing our stack. But we need chips to survive.\n\nHowever, the bet is only 56, pot 144. If we call, we will have about 92 chips left (148-56).

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop: board Kd 5h Ad, we have Qh Ts. So we have gutshot straight draw? Actually board: K A 5, we have Q T, so we have open-ended straight draw? Let's see: possible straight: Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace. We have Q T, missing J and maybe? Actually we have Ten and Queen, board has King Ace, missing Jack. Need J and also need? Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace is straight, we have Ten and Queen, board provides King Ace, need Jack. That's one card needed, but also need? The straight would be Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace, we have Ten and Queen, need Jack, plus need? That's only one missing card, but we need 5 cards: we have T, Q, K, A, need J. So it's a gutshot (one card) not open-ended. Also we have backdoor flush draw: hearts: we have Qh, board has 5h, need two more hearts. So potential.\n\nOur hand currently: Qh Ts, board Kd 5h Ad. No pair, no made hand. We have gutshot straight draw (J) and backdoor flush.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 56 into pot 144. That's about 0.39 pot. Small bet, maybe a continuation bet or a probe. He has 216 chips, big stack relative to us (148). He could be betting with a wide range: any Ace, K, maybe draws, etc.\n\nOur stack: 148, we have 56 to call, raise min 112 (so raise to 112 total). Our effective stack is 148, we could raise to 112 (leaving us 36 behind). Could also go all-in 148.\n\nWe need to consider tournament context: we have 9.2 BB, short stack. We need to pick up chips, but also preserve. We're BTN, we raised preflop to 32 (2x BB) from 148, so we were raising. Opponent called. So opponent likely has a range of hands that call a 2x raise from BTN: could be broadway, pairs, suited connectors, etc.\n\nNow flop is K A 5. Our raise preflop with Q T is a bit speculative but okay.\n\nNow opponent bets small. Options: call, raise (maybe all-in), fold. Considering we are short stack, maybe we could shove all-in? But raise to 112 is still less than all-in. However, a raise to 112 might be seen as a semi-bluff, but we have a gutshot and backdoor flush; not strong enough to commit.\n\nOur equity vs opponent's range? Opponent likely has many combos that beat us: Aces (A?), K, maybe also draws. Our chance to improve on turn or river is limited: need J for straight (4 outs) plus maybe hearts for flush (2 more outs after turn). So about 6 outs total, ~12% per street. Not great.\n\nGiven we have 9 BB, we could consider a shove to try to double up. But we have only 148 chips, and opponent has 216, so we would be short-stack vs bigger stack. If we shove all-in (148) we risk losing our stack. But we need chips to survive.\n\nHowever, the bet is only 56, pot 144. If we call, we will have about 92 chips left (148-56). That leaves us with 5.75 BB, dangerously short. If we raise to 112 (i.e., add 56 more), we commit 112 total, leaving us 36 chips (2.25 BB). That's even worse.\n\nIf we fold, we preserve 148 but lose the chance to double up.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to output JSON with action, raise_to null if not raise, and reasoning. Determine best action.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe go all-in (raise to 148). But raise_to must be total amount we put in, not additional. We have 148 total stack, but we already have 32 preflop committed? Actually our stack after preflop raise 32: we put 32 into pot, leaving 148-32=116 chips left? Wait initial stack 148 includes the raise? Usually stack shown is total chips before action? It says \"Your Stack: 148 chips (9.2 BB)\". That's current stack before flop action? After preflop raise of 32, our stack would be 148 - 32 = 116. But the representation may be after preflop? Usually stack shown is current stack after preflop? Not sure. But pot is 144 includes our raise. So likely our stack is 148 after preflop? Actually pot: blinds 8+16=24, plus our raise 32 (so we added 16 extra?), opponent called 16, so pot after preflop: 8+16+16+32 = 72? Wait compute: SB 8, BB 16, MiniMax called 16, we raised to 32, then they called 16 more? Actually raise to 32 means we put 32, they call 16 additional (since they already put 16 blind). So total contributions: SB 8, BB 16, MiniMax 16 (call) + 16 (call to raise) = 32, we 32. So total pot = 8+16+32+32 = 88. But pot shown is 144 after flop bet of 56. So preflop pot was 144-56 = 88, matches. So our stack after preflop is 148 - 32 = 116. So we have 116 remaining. The amount to call is 56, which would leave us with 60 chips after call. So we can raise to 112 (i.e., total contribution of 112 from us). Since we already have 32 in, raising to 112 means we add 80 more, total contribution 112, leaving 148-112 = 36. So we could also go all-in: raise to 148 (i.e., all-in). But legal actions list only fold, call, raise. Raise to 112 is min raise, but we could raise more up to all-in? Usually allowed. So we could raise to 148.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should go all-in to maximize fold equity. Reason: we are short, need to double up, we have some outs and backdoor flush, and opponent's bet is small, could fold many hands.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 148.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

In a tournament with 18 BB, we are shortish. AKo is a strong hand, but raising is typical. Need to consider opponent tendencies: Seat2 (Kimi-K2) is the SB, but they haven't acted yet? Actually SB already posted, but they are next after us? UTG is seat5, order: seat5 (us), then seat6? Actually seat numbers: seat1,2,3,4,5 (us). So after UTG, next seat is seat6? Not listed.

Seat 2 is after SB and BB, so likely UTG? Actually seat numbers: seat 1 is SB (post_sb 8), seat 5 is BB. So seat 2 is UTG (first to act). So a raise from UTG. A2 offsuit is not good for 3-bet. Likely fold. But we can consider calling to see flop? In tournament with 300 chips (18.8 BB), you have decent stack. However A2 offsuit is low equity vs typical UTG raise range (maybe 10-12%).

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #81, preflop. Our position BB, 7d8d suited, stack 268 (8.4 BB). Small blind posted 16, big blind posted 32, then we called 16 to complete BB, so we are in BB with 7d8d. Opponent seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 87 (so after posting 32 BB, they raise 55 more? Actually raise to 87 total, amount to call is 55). So we face a raise to 87, pot currently 119 (blinds+call). Our stack 268, min raise to 142 (i.e., raise at least to 142 total). Need decide fold/call/raise.\n\nWe have suited connectors 7-8 suited. In early tournament, short stack ~8 BB. Opponent's raise size: 87 from BB 32, so raise is 55 more, which is about 2.7 BB (since BB=32). That's a standard raise. Our stack 268, we can call 55, leaving us with 213 chips (~6.6 BB). Could also consider 3-bet. But with 7d8d, suited connectors have decent equity vs wide range, but we are short stack; 3-bet would be a large portion of stack. Minimum raise to 142 means raising to 142 total (i.e., additional 55). That would be a raise of 55? Wait: amount to call 55, min raise to 142 means we must increase total bet to at least 142 (i.e., raise by at least 55 more). So raise to 142 would be an additional 55 on top of call? Actually call 55 makes total 87, raise to 142 means we add 55 more, making total bet 142, so raise amount = 55. That's a 2.5x raise relative to original raise? The raise size would be 55, making pot larger.\n\nOur stack 268, raising to 142 would cost 142 chips, leaving 126. That's about 4 BB left. That's a big commitment. 7d8d suited is decent for 3-bet in short stack? Usually you might 3-bet with suited connectors if you think you have fold equity and can play post-flop. But with only 8 BB, a 3-bet that leaves you ~4 BB is risky. Could also go all-in (268) but that's huge.\n\nBetter perhaps to call and see flop, because 7d8d suited can flop draws and have implied odds. However, calling 55 with 8 BB leaves us with 213 chips, still enough to survive. But if we hit flop, we might be short stacked.\n\nOpponent's raise pattern: from recall, they have raised amounts: 16, 32, 24, 143, 119. So sometimes they raise big (143). This raise is 87, moderate. Could be a wide range. With 7d8d, you can call.\n\nThus decision: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Actually J, K, 3. 7-8 gives open-ended? 7-8 with board J K 3: need 9 or 10 for straight? 7-8-9-10-J would be straight, need 9 and 10 both? Actually you have 7-8, board J K 3. To make straight you need 9 and 10? You need 9 and 10 to complete 7-8-9-10-J. That's two cards, not a draw. You have a gutshot for 6-5-4? No. So no straight draw. Flush draw? 7d8d, board has no diamonds, so need two diamonds, not a draw. So we have just high card 8, nothing. Opponent is seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 32 chips left? Actually seat1 has 32 chips. Wait blinds: seat1 is BB with 32 chips left (short stack). He raised preflop to 87 (from 32? Actually he posted 32 blind, then raise to 87 total? He was BB with 32 chips, but his stack is 32 chips total? That seems weird: He posted 32 blind, then raise 87? That would be beyond his stack. But maybe seat1 has 32 chips left after posting? Actually seat1 had 32 chips total, posted 32 blind, so he is all-in preflop. But the actions show seat1 raise 87, which suggests he had more chips. Maybe seat1's stack is 229 chips initially? Wait seat1 is \"Kimi-K2 Thinking - 32 chips\". That's his current chip count after posting? Actually seat1 is BB, his stack is 32 chips after posting? The initial line: Seat1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 32 chips. That likely is his current stack (including blind posted). So he has 32 chips total, posted 32 blind, so he is all-in. Then raise 87? That cannot be. Possibly the numbers are off; maybe seat1's stack is 229 chips, seat2 is 0? Actually seat2 is Kimi-K2 - 229 chips (folded). So seat2 is the one with 229 chips but folded. So seat1 has 32 chips, seat2 229 but folded. So seat1 is short stack and posted 32 blind. Then raise 87? That would be impossible. Maybe the raise amount is total bet size? He posted 32, then raise to 87 means adds 55 more, total 87, which exceeds his stack (32). So maybe seat1 actually has larger stack, but the displayed chips are after posting? This confusion.\n\nNevertheless, we are in BB with 213 chips. Preflop we called 16 (SB) and then called 55 after raise. So pot now 174. After flop, amount to call is 0, we have option to check or raise. Opponent is short stack (maybe 32 chips). He likely is all-in preflop? Actually he raised to 87, we called, so now his remaining stack maybe 32-? Not sure.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, no draws, we should check and likely fold to any bet. But opponent may be short and might bet with any hand. Since we have very short stack? We have 213 chips, 6.7 BB, decent. We can try to steal? Not with weak hand.\n\nThus action: check. Reasoning: weak hand, no draws, check to see if opponent bets, then decide.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. So check.\n\n",

Usually after flop, the player left of button acts first. Button is seat1? Actually seat1 is SB? Wait blinds: seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? The preflop shows seat5 post_sb 16, seat1 post_bb 32. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So seat5 is small blind, seat1 big blind. So position: seat5 is SB, after flop they act first (SB is first to act). So we act first on turn. Opponent hasn't bet yet.

If we raise, min raise is 55 which is more than their stack, they'd be all-in for 32 maybe? Actually raise to 55 would be total bet of 55, they'd need to call 55 but they have only 32, they'd be all-in for 32. They could call all-in? Not sure.

So raising to 55 would be a bluff attempt to push them all-in for 32 (they would be forced to call). But they have only 32 chips, they'd be all-in anyway if they call. However, they could also fold. Their stack is very short; they might be willing to call any bet if they think they have a decent hand. But we have nothing. Likely they have a strong hand (maybe J K, or a pair). So a bluff may succeed? But they have only 32 chips; they may be desperate to double up. However, they also have limited chips; they may be more likely to call with any decent hand. Our chance of them folding? Maybe they have a marginal hand like a middle pair (3s) but board has two 3s, they could have a full house? Actually board has pair of 3s; they could have a set (3x) or a full house (J or K with 3?). Many combos. So they likely have a strong hand.\n\nGiven we have only high card 8, best is to check. Also we have short stack? Actually we have 213 chips, not short. So checking preserves chips. So action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Short stack, need to pick up chips or survive. Call would be 32 into pot 80, pot odds ~40% (32/(80+32)=0.285). Actually after call, pot 112, you invest 32, equity needed 28.5% to break even. 3T offsuit vs unknown range (SB, BB, and a caller). Likely not enough equity. Raise all-in? Minimum raise to 64, but you could raise all-in 213? Legal raise to at least 64, but you can go all-in if you can't meet min raise? Actually you can raise to any amount up to your stack; min raise is 64. So you could raise to 213 (all-in). That would be a shove of ~6.7 BB. With 3T, not a good shove. Might be a fold.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (Seat1 and 2) have raised various amounts in past, but here they are SB and BB. They posted blinds, not raised preflop. Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called 32 (maybe a loose caller). With short stack, maybe you could steal? But 3T is not a strong stealing hand, but maybe can steal blinds? However there are three players, SB and BB already have money in pot; you would need to raise to isolate. Raising could be a move to steal the BB? But the BB is also a player, and they may call or re-raise. With 3T, you risk being 3-bet.\n\nBetter to fold and preserve stack for better spot.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

It's preflop, amount to call 0 (since we are BB, we posted 32, and opponent called small blind 16, making pot 64). So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need to consider hand strength: Ah4h is a weak Ace, suited, low kicker. In BB short stack (5.7 BB). Options: check (to see flop cheap) or raise (maybe steal or isolate). But we are short stack; raising to 64 (minimum raise) would be a 2x raise (to 64 total). That would be a raise of 32 more (since we already have 32 in). That would be 2x BB (32). With a weak hand, maybe not raise. But also we might consider a shove? Minimum raise is 64, not all-in. All-in would be 181. We could raise to 64, but opponent already called small blind and may have a wide range. Raising could isolate and we could have some equity. But Ah4h is not great for 2-bet.\n\nCheck: we see flop cheap. Since we are short stack, we might want to see flop and then decide. But we risk being out of position later (we'll be out of position vs opponent on later streets). However we have the option to check and then possibly call a bet if flop favorable.\n\nGiven we have 5.7 BB, typical strategy is to push or fold unless we have decent hand. Ah4h is not strong enough to push. So best is to check.\n\nThus action: check. Reasoning: weak hand, short stack, no need to raise, see flop cheap.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Need consider opponent seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) with 254 chips, likely will call? He is in SB? Actually seat1 posted SB 16, then seat5 is BB. So seat1 is SB, seat5 BB. SB already posted 16, BB posted 32. So preflop action: SB posted 16, BB posted 32, others folded. So it's just heads-up blind. Now it's our turn to act (BB) after SB posted? Actually order: SB posts, BB posts, then action starts with player left of BB, which is SB (seat1). But they already posted blind, they haven't acted yet. So the order: SB is first to act preflop. However actions list shows only blinds posting, not betting. So we need to act after SB? Actually SB's action hasn't been shown, but they are still to act. Since it's our position BB, after posting blind, we act last preflop. So the amount to call is 16 (SB's blind). So we can call 16 to see flop (i.e., just match SB). We can also raise to 64 min raise. With 9-7 unsuited, short stack, not a good hand. Better to fold and preserve chips? But we have only 5 BB, folding leaves us 165 still. If we call, we invest 16 and see flop with weak hand. Might be okay to call if we think we can steal later? But with 9-7 off, not great. Could also go all-in to try to double up. But it's a weak hand, not advisable.\n\nGiven tournament, short stack, need to pick spots. With 5 BB, you should be looking to steal blinds or go all-in with decent range. 9-7 off is not a good candidate. So folding is likely.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Actually seat1 posted SB 16, seat5 is BB posted 32. So the only opponent left is seat1 (SB) who posted 16 and hasn't acted yet? Actually actions: seat5 post_sb 16 (that's us? Wait seat5 is BB, but they posted sb 16? That's weird: seat5 post_sb 16 means they posted small blind? But seat5 is BB seat, but maybe seat numbers are not standard. According to actions: seat5 post_sb 16, seat1 post_bb 32. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB with 3c7c, opponent is BB with 32. The amount to call is 16 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., raise 48 more). Our stack 314, can raise.\n\nWe need to decide fold/call/raise. 3c7c is a very weak hand, especially out of position (SB vs BB? Actually SB is first to act preflop after posting SB, then BB acts, but here we are SB and we act first? Actually order preflop: SB acts first, then BB. So we are first to act. We have 3c7c, not a good hand. Usually fold. However we might consider a steal? But SB cannot steal, because BB is bigger blind. Stealing is from later positions. SB can raise to try to isolate, but with such weak hand, not advisable. Stack is 9.8 BB, short stack but not ultra short. Should fold.\n\nCheck opponent's raise tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised large amounts preflop often (119,87,190,238,286). Those are likely from BB when they raise. So they are aggressive. If they raise now, we would be out of position. So folding is correct.\n\nThus action: fold.",

Opponents: seat1 SB 16 chips, seat2 BB 32 chips, seat4 folded, we are BTN.\n\nAmount to call 32 (BB). Minimum raise to 64 (so raise of 32 additional). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand Ts4c is weak, suited but low kicker. On button, with short stack (~10 BB) we could consider stealing blind by raising, but hand is weak. However with 10 BB, we might want to shove if raise is not enough? Minimum raise is 64, which is 2 BB raise (i.e., 2x big blind). That would be 64 total, i.e., we put 64 chips in, net profit 64-32 = 32 additional? Actually raise to 64 means we add 32 chips (call 32 + 32). That's a 2 BB raise. With 10 BB, a 2 BB raise is small, might be called by BB and SB.\n\nBut typical button steal is 2.5-3 BB. Here 2 BB is maybe okay. But hand is very weak; risk of being called and losing 32 chips. But losing 32 chips is about 10% of stack. Could be okay.\n\nWe need consider opponent tendencies: Seat1 SB has raised amounts ranging from 8 to 286 (varied). Many raises are larger, sometimes huge (286). Could be aggressive. Seat2 BB raises also varied, sometimes large. Both may be capable of 3-betting.\n\nBut we are facing no raise yet; they just posted blinds. So we can raise to steal.\n\nGiven short stack, we could also go all-in (314) but that is too much for a weak hand.\n\nBetter to fold? Many players will call small raise with any pair. Our hand has no pair, low chance to improve. But button advantage and steal potential.\n\nWhat is typical push/fold threshold at 10 BB? Usually push with any hand that has equity > ~15% vs 2 players. Ts4c is about 12% vs 2 random? Might be borderline. But we could just raise to 64 to attempt steal; if called, we can fold later.\n\nThus I think raise to 64 is reasonable.\n\nReasoning: button, short stack, blind steal, hand not great but acceptable for small raise.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 64.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop with Ts4c (ten of spades, four of clubs) on button, stack 250, blinds 16/32, pot 306 (including blinds and raise). Action history: SB (Seat1) posted 16, BB (Seat2) posted 32. Seat5 (us) raised 64 (so 64 total? Actually raise to 64 meaning we put 64 total, i.e., 32 raise? Let's assume we raised to 64 total). Then Seat1 re-raised to 121 (so total 121). Seat2 called 89 (so they put 89 more? Actually they called the raise to 121, meaning they put 121 total, but they already had 32 blind, so they call 89). Now amount to call is 57 (so we need to put 57 more to match 121). Minimum raise to 178 (i.e., raise total to at least 178). Our stack is 250, we have already put 64, so remaining 186. So we could raise to 178 (which would be additional 114). Or we could go all-in (250). Need to decide based on hand strength: Ts4c is a weak hand, especially off-suit, low kicker, low connectivity. In button, but facing a 3-bet from SB (who likely is short stack 16 chips? Actually SB has 16 chips total? Wait seat1 has 16 chips total, which is exactly the small blind amount, they are short stacked. They posted 16, then re-raised to 121, which is more than their stack? They have 16 total, can't raise. Something off: seat1 has 16 chips total, but they posted sb 16, then raise 121? That's impossible. Maybe the stack numbers are current after posting? Actually seat1: 16 chips (maybe after posting, they have 0 left). But they raise to 121? That seems inconsistent. Could be a mistake: maybe seat1's stack is 160? But given data, seat1 16 chips, seat2 60 chips, seat4 192 chips folded, we are 250. So seat1 is extremely short, maybe they are all-in for 16? But they raise to 121? That doesn't make sense. Possibly the \"post_sb 16\" means they posted 16, then later they raise to 121 (so they must have more chips). Could be a formatting error. Anyway, we have to decide.\n\nGiven we have a weak hand, and we face a 3-bet (raise to 121) from SB, and a call from BB. Our stack is 7.8 BB, we are short-stacked. In tournament, short stack, we need to pick up chips. Ts4c is not a good candidate to 3-bet or call. We could fold. But we already have 64 in pot, and amount to call is 57 to see flop. With 7.8 BB, calling 57 is about 1.8 BB (since BB 32). That's a small amount, could be a steal attempt? But we are out of position after flop? Actually we are button, so after flop we will be first to act (since blinds are before us). Actually position: SB is seat1, BB seat2, we are seat5 button, so after flop action order: SB, BB, then button. So we will be last preflop (we raised), then SB 3-bet, BB called, now it's our turn. If we call, we will be out of position postflop (since SB and BB act before us). That's not ideal with weak hand.\n\nGiven hand is weak, we should fold. Also stack is short; we might consider all-in if we had a decent hand, but we don't.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\nWe need to output JSON.\n\n",

We can check or raise. Raising could be a bluff, but we have short stack (6.8 BB). Our stack 218, min raise 32 would be 32 total? Actually raise_to = total amount we put in. Currently we have posted 32 BB, plus we haven't added any. If raise to 32, that's just call? Actually amount to call is 0, min raise to 32 means we need to put 32 chips total (i.e., bet 32). So raise to 32 would be a bet of 32 chips, making pot 108. That is 0.5 BB? Actually 32 is 1 BB. So bet 32 into 76 pot, ~0.42 pot. Could be a small bet to try to steal? Opponent may have strong hand (maybe KQ, etc). Our chance of improvement: need Ten on river for straight (9 outs? Actually four tens left). Also could improve with J? Pair J on river gives pair J, but board already has K Q, so pair J is low, likely lose. So not great.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should fold?

Pot is 76, we have 218 chips total, but after posting BB 32, we have 186 left. Actually stack includes posted blind? Usually stack includes after posting. So we have 218 chips total (including blind). Pot 76 includes our blind 32? Yes. So we have 218-32=186 remaining. Minimum raise is 32 (to total 64). That's a small raise relative to pot (pot 76). Could attempt a bluff to steal, but opponent may have a hand like KQ, QJ, etc. Board has KQ, so many combos. Opponent checking could indicate missed draw or weak. But we are short stacked; we want to accumulate chips. Could raise to 100? Minimum raise is 32 (to total 64). We could raise more if we want. But we have limited chips, but can still raise up to all-in (218). But opponent may call with any pair, like K, Q, etc. Our hand is worthless. So best is to check and preserve stack.

Actually actions: seat5 post_sb 16 (small blind?), seat1 post_bb 32 (big blind). Wait seat numbers: seat5 is us, but they posted SB? Usually SB is seat left of dealer. But they said Position: BB (Seat5). Yet actions show seat5 post_sb 16 (small blind) and seat1 post_bb 32 (big blind). So maybe the dealer is seat? Anyway we are in BB but we posted SB? Might be confusion. But amount to call is 16, meaning we need to call 16 to match the big blind? Actually big blind is 32, we posted small blind 16, so we need to call 16 more to complete the BB. So no raise yet. So we can call 16 (complete blind) or raise min 64 (to total 64). With 6c5s, a weak suited connector, short stack 6 BB. Should we call? In tournament early, we want to preserve chips but also maybe steal. 6c5s is not a good hand to call blind with. However we are already half blind; we could just call and see flop, but with 6 BB, maybe we want to raise to try to steal? But min raise to 64 total (i.e., raise 48 more). That's 2 BB raise (actually 64 total includes our 16 already posted? Not sure). So raise to 64 would be 48 more, making total bet 64. That's 2 BB raise. With 6c5s, not a good raise. Better to just call and see flop, maybe fold if nothing. But we are short stack, need to double up. However raising with 6c5s is low chance to win.

Wait: blinds: small blind 16 (seat5), big blind 32 (seat1). Actually seat5 is SB? Wait position: BB seat5, but actions show seat5 post_sb 16, seat1 post_bb 32. So seat5 is small blind, seat1 is big blind. Then seat5 call 16 (completes SB) and seat1 raise 242 (from BB). So we are in SB? Actually seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB with 6c5s, stack 186. After posting 16, we called 16 (so we are now at 0? Actually we posted SB 16, then call 16 to match BB? Wait we called 16 more to match BB's 32? Actually after SB, we need to call 16 more to match BB. So we have contributed total 32. Then BB raises to 242 (i.e., total bet 242). So amount to call is 210 (242-32). Minimum raise to 452. Legal actions: fold, call. So we cannot raise because our stack 186 is less than min raise? Actually we have 186 total stack before posting SB? Stack 186 includes the SB posted? Usually stack includes chips before posting. We posted 16, now remaining 170. To call 210 we need 210 more, but we only have 170. So we cannot call full amount; we can go all-in for remaining 170, which would be a call all-in (less than amount to call). Is that allowed? In poker, you can go all-in for less than bet, it's considered a call. So legal action includes call (meaning you can call all-in). So we can call all-in of 170 (i.e., go all-in). Decision: With 6c5s, short stack, facing a raise from BB (who is presumably a short stack too? Actually seat1 has 32 chips, but that's their stack after posting BB? Actually seat1 stack is 32 chips total? That seems they are also short. They have only 32 chips left (i.e., they are on the brink). So they raise to 242, but they only have 32? Something off. The stack numbers: seat1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 32 chips (maybe that's their stack after posting BB?). So they have 32 chips total, posted BB 32, they have no remaining chips. How can they raise? Actually they can't raise beyond their stack; maybe the numbers are misaligned: The \"players at table\" shows chip counts before posting blinds? Usually you list current stack before posting. So seat1 has 32 chips total, posted BB 32, now they have 0 left, but they raise to 242? That is impossible. Something off. Possibly the chip counts are after posting blinds? Or maybe the numbers are just placeholders. We need to decide action.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, 6-5 unsuited, short stack, and facing a raise from BB (who may be a short stack, but raising big). Likely we should fold. The raise is 242, which is huge relative to pot (274). Our hand has low equity. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON with fold.\n\n",

If we raise, we risk being 3-bet against a player who called with unknown range (maybe wide). Our stack is short; we could consider a shove (all-in) to try to double up. K2 is not a good candidate for shove; it's a weak hand. Better to just check and hope to see a cheap flop, maybe fold later. Since amount to call is 0, checking is fine. So action: check.\n\nWe need to output JSON with action \"check\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Raising could be a bluff to win the pot now (80) and also maybe push him all-in for 4 extra chips, but we risk being called if he has a hand. But he cannot call a raise of 32 because he only has 4 chips; he could go all-in for 4, which we could call. If we raise to 32, he would be forced to go all-in for his remaining 4, we would have to call 4 to win the pot. That might be okay: we risk 4 chips to win 80+32? Actually if we raise to 32, total pot becomes 80+32=112. He could go all-in for 4, we call 4, pot becomes 116, we win 112? Wait compute: currently pot 80. If we raise to 32 (total bet 32), we put 32 in, pot becomes 112. Opponent can either call 32 (can't) or go all-in for 4 (less than 32). In many rules, a short stack can call for his remaining chips, which would be considered a call of 4, and we would have to call his all-in to win the extra 4. So net: we put 32, he puts 4, we call 4 (or we already put 32). Actually after we raise, the bet is 32, he is short, so he can either fold or go all-in for 4, which is considered a call of his remaining stack. So if he calls, we have 32+4 = 36 in the pot from us (32 + we will call 4? Actually we already put 32, we need to match his 4? Usually you would just match his all-in, but you already have 32, which is more than 4, so you are already ahead. So you don't need to add more chips. So you would just win the pot of 80+32+4=116. So you invest 32 to win 116, net +84. That's good if opponent folds. If he calls with 4, you still win net +84 (since you invested 32, get back 116). If he has a hand that beats you, you lose 32. That's a risk.\n\nGiven we have no showdown value, raising is a bluff. Opponent is short, maybe will call with any pair or Ace high? He called preflop 32, maybe he has a hand like A? Not sure. With such a short stack, he might be looking for a shove. He could be holding a hand like J9, etc. But board is T 5 6, maybe he has a pair of T or a straight draw. He could have 9-8 for open-ended? Actually board T-5-6, 8-9 would be open-ended? No, 8-9 would give 9-10-... Not a straight. Straight draws: 8-7 gives 6-7-8-9-10? No 9 missing. 7-8 gives 6-7-8-9-10 missing 9. So no.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand: 2d Kc, board: Ts 5d 6s 5s. So board shows pair of fives and a ten. Our hand: King high, no pair, no straight draw (2-5-6-10). No flush draw (two spades on board, we have Kc, 2d, no spade). So very weak hand, basically just king high. Opponent seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 4 chips left (tiny). They are short stacked. They are on the button? Actually seat 2 is after seat 1 (folded) and before seat 3 (folded). So seat 2 is UTG? Not relevant. They have 4 chips, so they are essentially all-in or about to be forced. They called preflop 32 (so they had at least 32 chips). Wait they have 4 chips now? The stack after preflop? Actually stack shown is current stack before turn: seat2 has 4 chips. So they are short-stacked, likely all-in preflop? They called 32, but they only have 4 chips left now, meaning they must have posted an all-in? But the actions: preflop: seat2 call 32. So they had at least 32 chips preflop. After posting 32, they'd have 4 chips left (since they had 36?). So they are now short-stacked with 4 chips left. So they are effectively all-in for 4 more chips? Actually they are not all-in; they have 4 chips left to act. On turn, amount to call is 0 (no bet). So they can check or bet? They have 4 chips; they could bet but not in legal actions for us: we have legal actions: fold, check, raise. So we can raise to at least 32 (minimum raise). But we only have 202 chips. Raising to 32 would be a raise of 32 (since amount to call 0). But opponent only has 4 chips left, they cannot call a raise of 32; they'd be forced to fold. So raising is a bluff to win the pot of 80 chips, but we risk committing chips. Since opponent is short, they may be willing to go all-in for 4 chips. But they have no bet now; they could bet 4 chips (but not in our legal actions). Actually it's our turn, we have legal actions: fold, check, raise. So we cannot bet less than min raise (32). So raising would be a huge overbet relative to their stack; they'd fold. So best is to check, let them check, go to river. But we have no chance to win anyway. However maybe we can check and hope they bet small (they can't bet less than min raise? Actually they also have same legal actions when it's their turn: they'd have same min raise 32, but they only have 4 chips, so they'd be forced to go all-in (bet their remaining 4) maybe considered a bet? Not sure. Usually if a player has less than the minimum raise, they can go all-in for that amount. So they could bet 4 all-in. If they do, we can call 4 (call) and lose anyway. But if we check, they might check and we go to river, still lose. So either way we lose. But maybe we could raise to 32 to push them out, then win the pot uncontested. That costs us 32 chips, but we win 80 chips, net +48 chips. That's a good move: we effectively steal the pot from a short stack with no bet. Since they cannot call, they will fold. So raising is profitable. However we must consider tournament: we have 6.3 BB, raising 32 is about 0.16 BB? Actually blinds are 16/32, so 32 is 1 BB. So raise to 32 (i.e., bet 32) is a standard raise. That's fine. So we should raise to 32 to steal. Reason: we have weak hand, opponent short stack, can't call.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 32. Reasoning: we are stealing the pot, opponent cannot call.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed. Minimum raise to 32. So we raise to 32.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Effective stacks: we have 166, others have 290, 8 (tiny), 0, 184. We are short stacked, need to find best move: either shove all-in (raise to 166) or call 64 or fold. Hand Q5 suited is weak, not a good shoving hand. But we could call and hope to see flop? With 2.6 BB, calling 64 leaves 102 left, still short. Better to shove all-in to maximize fold equity? But Q5 suited is not a good all-in; may get called by better hands, lose. However, with such short stack, you may need to pick a hand to go all-in. Typically you push with any Ace, broadway, suited connectors, etc. Q5 is borderline. Might consider folding.\n\nWe can also check opponent tendencies: seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat 2 is Kimi-K2 with 8 chips (short). Seat 2 is already all-in? Actually seat 2 posted BB 64, not all-in. So if we call 64, we will be left with 102 chips. Could we later be forced to push later? Might be okay.\n\nGiven hand strength: Q5 suited has some potential to hit flush or straight, but low equity vs typical ranges. In button vs SB and BB, we could attempt to steal by raising. Minimum raise is 128 total, which would be raise to 128 (i.e., add 64 more). That would be a raise of 64 more, total put in 128. Our stack 166, so raise to 128 leaves 38 behind. That's a small raise, not all-in. Could also raise all-in to 166.\n\nBut legal actions include raise. We could raise to 166 (all-in) to apply pressure; SB may fold, BB may call with a wide range? BB has 64 already, so they'd have to call 102 more. They might call with many hands given they are short? Actually BB has 64 blind, but stack 64? Wait seat 2 is BB with 64 chips, that's his entire stack. So BB is effectively all-in already (post blind). So if we raise, we are raising against a blind that is already all-in? Actually the BB's 64 is his stack, so he's all-in. So raising would be a re-raise (i.e., we would be raising over the BB's all-in, which is not allowed because you can't raise over an all-in? In poker, you can only call the all-in or fold. So legal actions should be fold, call, raise? But raise is not possible because opponent is all-in? However system says raise is legal. Possibly they treat BB as just a blind, not all-in. Actually stack 64 equals blind amount, but he could have more chips? No stack is 8 chips for seat 2? Wait seat 2 is Kimi-K2 - 8 chips. Oh sorry, seat 2 has 8 chips total, posted BB 64? That can't be; maybe seat 2 is the BB with 8 chips left after posting? Actually they posted BB 64, but stack says 8 chips; contradictory. Might be that seat 2's stack is 8 chips after posting? So they are effectively all-in for 8? Not sure.\n\nGiven confusion, we treat as normal: we can call 64 to match BB, then SB may act later.\n\nGiven short stack, best is to go all-in with any hand that has some equity. Q5 suited is not great but could be okay. However folding preserves chips for better spot. Since we have 2.6 BB, we are in danger of being blinded out. If we fold, we lose 0 chips but will be forced to post blinds later and likely be eliminated. Might be better to shove.\n\nI think we should raise all-in (to 166) as a shove.\n\nReasoning: short stack, button, want to steal blinds, Q5 suited has some flush potential, and we can apply pressure. So raise to 166.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with AA, stack 198, pot 144 after flop. Opponent MiniMax-M2 (Seat4) checked. It's a very strong hand, but we are short stacked (3.1 BB). We want to maximize value but also consider risk of being called by worse hand. With AA vs unknown range (likely some weak hand, maybe draws). We could check to see a free card, but risk giving free turn card that could improve opponent. Better to bet for value. Minimum raise to 64, that would be raise to 64 total (i.e., bet 64). That would be about half pot (pot 144, bet 64 makes pot 208). Opponent has 56 chips left, less than raise amount, so if we raise to 64, it's more than his stack; he could only call all-in 56? Actually raise to 64 means we put total 64 chips into pot (including our existing 64 blind?). Wait we are in BB, we posted 64. The pot is 144 includes our 64, opponent's 32 call, seat2 call 16, seat1 fold, seat4 call 32? Let's compute: Preflop: seat4 post sb 32, seat5 post bb 64, seat1 fold, seat2 call 16 (maybe small blind?), seat4 call 32 (call to BB), seat5 check (BB). So preflop pot: 32+64+16+32 = 144. Yes.\n\nNow flop: seat4 check, amount to call 0. Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., bet 64). But opponent only has 56 chips left, less than 64, so we can raise all-in for 56 (or raise to 64 which would be more than his stack, effectively all-in). We need to see legal actions: raise is allowed. So we should raise all-in (i.e., raise to 198 total? Actually we have 198 total stack, we have already 64 in pot, remaining 134. Opponent has 56. Minimum raise to 64 means total bet of 64 (including our previous 64?), but we have already contributed 64 preflop, but that counts to our stack? Usually raise amount is additional chips beyond call. But the spec says raise_to is total amount you're putting in. So raise_to 64 would be total contribution after raise? That seems ambiguous. Usually raise to 64 means total bet of 64, but we already have 64 in pot, so raise to 64 is just check? Actually amount to call is 0, so a raise to 64 would be putting 64 more chips, total contribution 128. That would exceed opponent's stack. So we could raise to 120 (all-in). But legal actions minimum raise to 64 indicates you must bet at least 64 more? That's typical: minimum raise = big blind amount = 64. So we could raise to 64 more, i.e., total 128, but opponent only has 56 left, so they'd be forced all-in for 56. That's fine.\n\nThus we should raise (all-in) to maximize value. Reason: AA is nuts, short stack, need chips, opponent may call with any pair or draw. So raise all-in.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to maybe 120? But we need to follow spec: raise_to total amount we are putting in. Our total stack is 198, we already have 64 in pot, remaining 134. If we go all-in, total contribution becomes 64+134=198. So raise_to 198. That is allowed? Minimum raise is 64, we can raise more. So raise_to 198.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #105 preflop. Position BB, stack 246 (3.8 BB). Blind levels 32/64. So BB posted 64, SB posted 32. Pot 96. Opponent seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 218 chips, presumably is the SB? Actually seat1 is SB? Wait seat numbers: seat5 is us (BB). seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 218 chips. The blinds: seat5 post_sb 32 (that's weird: seat5 posted small blind? Actually they say preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 32, Seat1 post_bb 64. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But we are BB seat5? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". Yet actions show seat5 posted sb. Something contradictory. Probably seat5 is SB but they label position BB incorrectly? Actually maybe the table is 5 players? But they show seat4 fold. The blinds: seat5 posted sb 32, seat1 posted bb 64. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are actually SB, not BB. But the description says BB. Might be a mistake. We'll treat as we are SB (small blind) with 32 posted, facing a BB of 64. The amount to call is 32 (to call BB). Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., raise total to 128). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nOur hand: Ac 3h (Ace low, unsuited). Very weak hand, especially out of position (if we are SB vs BB). Stack shallow 3.8 BB total; after posting SB we have 214 chips left? Actually stack 246 includes posted blinds? Usually stack includes chips before posting? They gave stack 246 chips (3.8 BB). After posting SB 32, we have 214 left. So we can call 32 to see flop, leaving 182 chips (2.8 BB). Raising to 128 would be a raise of 96 more (total 128). That's a huge raise for a weak hand. Considering we are short-stacked, we could consider all-in but we have 246 chips total; all-in is 246. That's more than 4 BB. Might be okay to push all-in with Ace high? But Ace low 3 is not strong.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2's raise sizes: early small raises 6, 12, 16, 24, 40, 48, 32, 133. This indicates they sometimes raise big (133) relative to blind (maybe deep). But in this tournament, stack sizes vary. The raise amounts listed are not relative to blind; need to know typical stack. Hard to interpret. But they have raised 32 before (hand 80). So they can raise to 32 preflop. The minimum raise is 128, so raising to 128 is a 2x BB raise.\n\nGiven our weak hand, short stack, we likely should fold. Calling 32 is cheap but we have Ace high; could see flop, but with only 2.8 BB left, we risk being out of position and may be forced to fold later. However Ace-high sometimes wins at showdown. But with such low stack, we want to preserve chips; but also we need to accumulate chips to survive. Our stack 3.8 BB is low; we need to double up soon. But Ace 3 is not a good candidate to double up.\n\nThus folding is prudent.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Opponent MiniMax-M2 in SB has 48 chips left, already posted 32 sb, and called 32 to match BB? Actually they posted SB 32, then called 32 (so total 64). They have 48 left after posting? Wait they started 48 chips, posted 32 sb, then called 32 = total 64, which exceeds their stack. Something off. Actually seat 4 has 48 chips total, posted 32 sb, then call 32 would be all-in (they only have 16 left). Probably they are all-in for remaining 16. So they are effectively all-in for 48 total (32 sb + 16 call). So the pot is 128 (64 from BB, 64 from SB? Actually BB posted 64, SB posted 32+16=48, plus maybe some extra? The pot shown 128 maybe includes both. Anyway we face no bet, amount to call 0, we can check or raise. With 2.8 BB, we are short. Pocket sevens are a medium pair; against a short stack all-in, we might consider calling to win chips. But we have only 2.8 BB, raising would commit more and possibly get called by someone else? Only opponent left. So best is to call (i.e., check) because amount to call is 0, but we want to match the all-in? Actually opponent is already all-in, we can call by checking? In poker software, if opponent is all-in, you can call the all-in amount; but amount to call is 0 because they already are all-in? The pot includes their all-in, we can either call (match) but they are already all-in, we need to put chips equal to their bet (which is 48 total). Our BB already posted 64, which is more than their bet, so we are already covered? Actually we posted 64, they bet 48 total, we have already contributed 64, so we are ahead, we are effectively already covering their bet, so we can check and win the pot if they are all-in.

The board shows possible straight draws: 9-8-J gives open-ended straight draws? Actually 9-8-J, the missing 10 and Q would make straight. Our 7s doesn't help. Also possible flush draws? Board has spade 9s, club 8c, hearts J?, actually J is hearts? board says Jh (hearts). 2c clubs. So only one spade, one heart, two clubs. No flush possibilities for us.\n\nWe have 7-7, currently second pair? Actually board has J,9,8,2. Our pair is lower than any pair on board (none). So we have just a middle pair (sevens). Opponent (MiniMax-M2) is seat 4, with 48 chips left (short stack). They have checked all streets. So they are likely low stack, maybe they are short and may be all-in later. Now it's our turn, amount to call is 0, min raise is 64. Our stack is 182 chips, we could raise to 64 (minimum raise). But we need to consider that opponent only has 48 chips left. So we could bet (raise) to 64, which would be more than opponent's stack, effectively putting them all-in for 48? Actually if we raise to 64, they'd have to call 64, but they only have 48, so they'd be all-in for 48, we could call their all-in. But we could also just check and see if they bet later. However they are short-stacked and may be looking to shove. Our hand is weak. We have only a pair of sevens, not a strong hand. The opponent could have a better hand (e.g., 10-? for straight draw, or Jx for top pair, or 9x, 8x). They could also have a weaker hand and be trying to shove.\n\nGiven we have only 2.8 BB, we are also short. We need to consider tournament life. If we can win the opponent's 48 chips, we increase stack. If we raise to 64, we risk losing more if opponent calls with a better hand. But opponent checking suggests they may be weak or waiting to shove. Could we check and then if they bet, we can decide? Since amount to call is 0, checking is safe. Raising might scare them off if they have weak hand; they may fold, losing 48 chips to us anyway (we get nothing). Actually if we raise to 64, they can fold, we win nothing. If we check, they could bet any amount up to 48 (their stack). If they bet, we could decide to call or fold. With a pair of sevens, likely we are behind many hands. So maybe best to check and fold to any bet.\n\nThus I will check.\n\nLegal actions include fold, check, raise. Check is allowed. So choose \"check\".",

Actually 7-8-9-J is not a straight; need 10 for 8-9-10-J. 7-8-9-J is missing 10. 7-8-9-J is not a straight. 7-8-9-J-? No. 7-8-9-J-? Not a straight. Also 6c on turn gives 6-7-8-9-J? That's still not a straight. Need 10 for straight, or 5 for 5-6-7-8-9. We have 6c and 7s, so we have 5-6-7-8-9? No 5 not on board. So we have a pair of 7s, no flush (board has three clubs: 9s,8c,Jh,2c,6c -> clubs: 8c,2c,6c = three clubs, we have no club). So we have middle pair, likely losing to any higher pair (J,9,8) or any straight or flush. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) checked river. Both checked. So we can check.\n\nGiven amount to call 0, we can check. No raise needed. So action: check.\n\nBut we need to consider if we should raise as bluff? Our stack is 182 chips, pot 128, we are short stacked (2.8 BB). Raising could risk all-in and likely lose. Opponent likely has something better; but maybe they are short and might fold to a raise? However they just checked river after checking all streets, suggests weak hand maybe. But they could have J,9,8, maybe a straight draw missed, etc. But they might also have a missed draw. With only 182 chips, a raise to 64 would be 64 total? Minimum raise is 64 (i.e., raise to 64 total? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in, not additional. So raising to 64 means you put total 64 chips in pot, i.e., you add 64? But you already have 0 contributed on river. So you'd be betting 64. That's about half pot. Could be a bluff. But with 2.8 BB, you might want to go all-in to try to steal blinds? But it's river, not blinds. The pot is 128, your stack 182, you could go all-in 182. That could be a move. But risk: opponent might call with J or better.\n\nGiven we have a weak hand and short stack, best is to check and hope to win at showdown (maybe opponent also weak). So check.\n\nThus output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 4c3c, very weak, low stack 4.3 BB. There's a small blind posted 32 (seat5)?? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Wait: seat5 post_sb 32, seat1 post_bb 64. So seat5 is SB? Actually seat5 is BB? The description says Position: BB (Seat5). But actions show seat5 posted SB 32, seat1 posted BB 64. Maybe reversed: seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But we are in BB? Regardless, we are in big blind with 4c3c, stack 278, blinds 32/64, pot 96. We have to call 32 to see flop. With 4.3 BB, we could consider shove? Minimum raise to 128, that's a raise of 64 (since call is 32). But we have 278 chips, we could go all-in for 278? Minimum raise is 128 (total). All-in is allowed if can't meet min raise? Actually we can raise to any amount >= min raise. All-in of 278 is > min raise, so legal. However hand is very weak, and short stack. Should we fold? With 4c3c unsuited, low chance of winning. Short stack, maybe shove to steal? But we are out of position (big blind) with 4c3c, opponents likely have called or raised? Actually only SB posted 32, BB posted 64, no other players. So we are heads-up vs SB. SB posted 32, we have to call 32 to see flop. The SB may be a short stack (194 chips). Could they be likely to raise? No raise yet. So we can call 32 and see flop cheap. With 4c3c, we have potential for straight draws. But we have only 4.3 BB; calling 32 leaves us with 246 chips, still short. If we call and miss, we may be forced to fold later. But we can also shove all-in to apply pressure; SB only has 194 chips, could fold. However with such weak hand, risk is high. Expected value: If we shove, we win 194 chips if opponent folds, lose 278 if they call and we lose (which is likely). Opponent may call with a wide range? In short stack, they might call with any pair, maybe A-high. Our equity vs random hand is low ~10%. So not good. Better to fold? But folding loses 64 already posted? Actually we already posted BB 64, we can fold and lose that. Calling costs 32 extra, but gives chance to win pot of 96 + opponent's 32 = 128? Actually pot before action is 96 (SB 32 + BB 64). If we call 32, pot becomes 128. Expected value: we invest 32 to possibly win 128 (net +96). Our chance to win maybe 10% => EV = 0.1*96 - 0.9*32 = 9.6 - 28.8 = -19.2. So negative. So fold is better.\n\nThus action: fold.",

Actually BB is seat4 but out, so only SB and us. SB could call all-in with any hand. Our hand is terrible; risk of being called and losing.\n\nBetter to fold and preserve chips? But we are short; folding loses 32 chips (the blind). Call would be cheap, maybe see flop with 2h3h suited, could hit a straight or flush. With 4.3 BB, calling 32 is 0.5 BB, not huge. Might be okay to call with any suited connectors? 2-3 suited is low but could be okay given desperation.

Wait actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 32 (so seat5 is SB? But position says BTN seat5. In a 5-player? Actually blinds: SB is seat5? Usually BTN is after BB. But they posted SB. Might be a mislabel: seat5 posted SB, seat1 posted BB. So we are in SB (small blind) with 3s Qs. Stack 326 chips, 5.1 BB. So we are short-stacked, must act after BB. Amount to call is 32 (to call BB). Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., raise 96 more). With Q3 suited, short stack, you could consider shove (all-in) if raise to 326? Actually you can raise to any amount >=128. With 5 BB, typical strategy: push or fold unless you have good hand. Q3 suited is weak, but could be a push if you think you are short and want to steal blinds? However you are in SB, not BTN. There are only two players left (SB and BB). You can either call 32 to see flop, or raise to try to steal BB. With such a short stack, you could go all-in to try to double up. But Q3 suited is not a good hand to shove; but with 5 BB, many push/fold strategy: push with any hand above a certain equity threshold. Q3 suited is about 25% equity vs random BB? Might be okay to shove? However many players will call with any pair, A-x, etc. Might be risky. Better to just call the BB and see flop? But with 5 BB, calling 32 leaves you with 294 behind, still short. You could also fold to preserve stack for better spot. Usually with 5 BB, you push or fold, not call. So decision: push all-in (raise to 326). Reason: short stack, want to steal blinds; Q3 suited has some suitedness and queen high may be decent.\n\nLegal actions include raise; we can raise to all-in. So action: raise, raise_to 326.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Opponent (Seat 3) raised preflop to 10 (from UTG maybe). We called. Now flop: pot 21 chips. Opponent's action? Not listed; we have amount to call 0, meaning opponent checked? Actually after flop, actions list not shown. The legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call 0, it's our turn. So opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) must have checked to us. So we have a set on a paired board (two sevens). Potential for full house if a 7 appears (board already has pair). Our eights are not on board, so we have set, which is best likely unless opponent has a full house already (like 7-7 or 3-3). Opponent could have 7x, 3x, or a straight? Board is 3-7-7. No straight possibilities yet. So we should consider raising to protect and extract value. Stack sizes: both have ~190 chips. Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to at least 8 more than current bet? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 8 means you put 8 chips total? Minimum raise to 8 likely means you need to bet at least 8 chips. Pot is 21, so a raise to 8 would be a bet of 8 chips (since no prior bet). That is about 1/3 pot. Could be okay, but we might want bigger to protect against draws (like 6-8, 5-9 etc). However opponent may have a hand like 7-7 (full house) or 7-8 (full house) etc. We want value. Since stacks are shallow, we can go for bigger bet, maybe 12-15 chips. The raise must be at least 8, but we can raise to 15. Let's consider opponent's range: they raised preflop, likely strong. Could be 77, 33, 88, AK, AQ, etc. On flop with paired sevens, they could have 77 (full house), 7x (full house), 3x (full house), or overpairs (AA, KK). Our set is likely best vs most except full houses. So we want to extract value from weaker hands like top pair (7?), but they have 7 already on board, they'd need a 7 in hand to have full house, otherwise they have just a pair of sevens on board, which is a pair, not strong. Many players will bet with top pair (7) but we have set. So raise to maybe 15 (approx 70% pot). That seems good.\n\nCheck if opponent's tendencies: no data. Use recall_opponent_actions for flop raises gave none. Could search for opponent's preflop raise patterns? Not needed.\n\nThus decide to raise to 15 chips. Reasoning: set, want value, protect against draws, opponent checked, likely weaker.\n\nReturn JSON."

So we have a set on a paired board (two sevens). Potential for full house if a 7 appears (board already has pair). Our eights are not on board, so we have set, which is best likely unless opponent has a full house already (like 7-7 or 3-3). Opponent could have 7x, 3x, or a straight? Board is 3-7-7. No straight possibilities yet. So we should consider raising to protect and extract value. Stack sizes: both have ~190 chips. Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to at least 8 more than current bet? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 8 means you put 8 chips total? Minimum raise to 8 likely means you need to bet at least 8 chips. Pot is 21, so a raise to 8 would be a bet of 8 chips (since no prior bet). That is about 1/3 pot. Could be okay, but we might want bigger to protect against draws (like 6-8, 5-9 etc). However opponent may have a hand like 7-7 (full house) or 7-8 (full house) etc. We want value. Since stacks are shallow, we can go for bigger bet, maybe 12-15 chips. The raise must be at least 8, but we can raise to 15. Let's consider opponent's range: they raised preflop, likely strong. Could be 77, 33, 88, AK, AQ, etc. On flop with paired sevens, they could have 77 (full house), 7x (full house), 3x (full house), or overpairs (AA, KK). Our set is likely best vs most except full houses. So we want to extract value from weaker hands like top pair (7?), but they have 7 already on board, they'd need a 7 in hand to have full house, otherwise they have just a pair of sevens on board, which is a pair, not strong. Many players will bet with top pair (7) but we have set. So raise to maybe 15 (approx 70% pot). That seems good.\n\nCheck if opponent's tendencies: no data. Use recall_opponent_actions for flop raises gave none. Could search for opponent's preflop raise patterns? Not needed.\n\nThus decide to raise to 15 chips. Reasoning: set, want value, protect against draws, opponent checked, likely weaker.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Now it's our turn to act first on turn (since we acted first on flop). Actually after flop, action order: seat5 acted first, seat3 called. On turn, seat5 acts first again. So we have option to bet/raise/check. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we can check or raise. Minimum raise to 15 (so raise to at least 15 more than current bet? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in? Minimum raise to 15 means we need to raise to at least 15? Actually we haven't bet yet on turn, so we could bet 15 minimum. So we could bet 15 (raise to 15). Or we could check.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: we have 175 chips, opponent 175. Pot 51. Turn we could bet for value, protect against draws. Our hand is strong but not best if opponent has set of sevens. Set of sevens would beat us. Probability opponent has set: preflop they raised, could have pocket 7s (there are two 7s on board, one left in deck). Actually board has two 7c and 7s. There are two sevens left in deck (7h,7d). Opponent could have pocket 7s (set). They called flop, which had paired sevens, they'd have a set and likely call. So we are behind if they have set. However we have a flush draw and two pair.\n\nWe could check to see opponent's action, but if they have set they'd likely bet. If they have a draw, they'd call or raise. We could bet to protect and get value from worse hands like a single 8? Actually opponent could have a single 8 (but we have both eights). So not. Could have a pair of 6s? 6c on board, they'd have a pair of 6s maybe, but they'd have two pair 6-7? Actually they'd have 6-7? If they have 6x, they'd have two pair 7s and 6s? Board has 6c, they could have 6d, they'd have two pair 7s and 6s, which is weaker than our eights and sevens. So we have value.\n\nThus betting for value is good. Size? Pot 51, we could bet about half pot to protect and get value: maybe 30-35. Minimum raise is 15, but we can raise to any amount up to our stack. Should we go all-in? Not necessary.\n\nGiven tournament, we have decent stack. I'd bet around 30. Since raise_to is total amount we put in, we need to specify total bet amount. Since no prior bet, raise_to = 30 (i.e., bet 30). Provide reasoning.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to: 30.",

Seats: 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB), seat 4 MiniMax-M2 called 2 (big blind) after SB posted 1. So SB is first to act after BB? Actually order: SB posts 1, BB posts 2, then action goes to UTG? But only seat 4 is left (MiniMax-M2) who called 2. Then it's SB's turn to act (we are SB). Amount to call is 1 (to match BB's 2? Actually BB already 2, SB posted 1, so to call need 1 more to make 2). So we face a 1 chip call. Minimum raise to 4 (so raise to total 4 chips). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand: 8d Jh unsuited. In SB with 112.5 BB, deep stack. Opponent called big blind, likely a wide-ish range maybe. 8J is a decent suited? It's off-suit, not great but can be played from SB sometimes against a single caller. The opponent's stack is 195 chips, similar. The pot now is SB (1) + BB (2) + opponent call (2) = 5. If we call, we put 1 more, pot becomes 6, we go to flop with 8J off-suit, stack 224 after call. If we raise to 4, we add 3 more chips (since we already posted 1). That would be a raise of 2? Actually raise to 4 total means we put total of 4 chips into pot. We have already 1, so need to add 3. That is a raise of 2 over the call amount (which is 2). Minimum raise is 4 total, so raise size is 2 over call. That is a small raise, typical to isolate. Could also consider folding but 8J is decent to see a cheap flop.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: we have no data. Could be random. Raising could isolate and give us position (post-flop we will be out of position because we are SB after BB and opponent is in BB? Actually after raise, the action will be on BB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) and opponent (MiniMax-M2) who called the big blind; but we raised, so both must act. The BB will act first (since SB raises, action goes to BB then to other players). So we would be out of position post-flop. So raising may not be great.\n\nGiven we have a mediocre hand, probably best to just call the 1 chip and see flop cheap. 8J offsuit can make top pair, straight draws. So call.\n\nThus decision: call.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

Opponent: Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called preflop, now after seat1 (BB) checked, it's our turn (SB). Seat4 hasn't acted yet? Actually order: SB is seat5, then BB seat1, then seat4 (CO?) Wait positions: seat5 SB, seat1 BB, seat4 is MP? Actually seat numbers: seat1 is BB, seat2 is maybe UTG? seat3? but irrelevant. The action order preflop: seat5 post sb (small blind) 1, seat1 post bb 2, seat2 fold, seat3 fold, seat4 call 2 (so limp), seat5 call 1 (complete sb), seat1 check (BB checks). So after preflop, we have three players: seat1 BB, seat4, seat5. The flop: board 9h5d3c. Action: seat1 checked, now seat4 acts? Actually order is seat4 (UTG?) but seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB, seat4 is CO? In typical order, after flop, action starts with first active player left of button. Button is seat5? Actually button is seat5? In heads-up? No, there are 5 seats but only 3 active. The button likely seat5? Actually seat5 is SB, seat1 BB, seat4 is maybe UTG? Usually button is seat? Not given. But we have amount to call 0, meaning it's our turn with no bet. So we can check or raise. Evaluate hand: 8d Jh, board 9h 5d 3c. We have gutshot straight draw? 8-J, board 9,5,3. Straight possibilities: 7-8-9-10-J? We have J, need 10 for open-ended? Actually we have 8 and J, board 9. So we have inside straight draw: need 10 to make 8-9-10-J? That would be 8-9-10-J? That's only four cards, need also 7 or Q? Let's examine: With 8 and J, possible straight combos: 7-8-9-10-J (needs 7 and 10) not possible. 8-9-10-J-Q (needs 10 and Q). So we have two outs? Actually need 10 to make 8-9-10-J? That's only four cards, need also something else? Straight of 8-9-10-J-Q requires Q also. So we need both 10 and Q? That's too many. So we have no straight draw. We have gutshot? 8-J with board 9-5-3: if a 7 comes, we have 7-8-9-? need? Not. So no immediate draw.\n\nWe have a backdoor flush draw? We have Jh, board has heart 9h, we have Jh (heart). So we have a flush draw with hearts: need two more hearts on turn and river. Currently one heart on board, we have one heart in hand, so two hearts needed for flush.\n\nWe have pair? No pair. So we have overcards (J) and 8 is middle. Not strong.\n\nOpponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called preflop, likely a wide range limp. They may have anything. They checked on flop. So likely they have weak or medium hand.\n\nGiven our stack 224, pot 6, we can check. Raising may be possible to steal? But we are out of position (SB) and opponent is in front (likely seat4 is next to act).

Calling the 2\u2011chip BB is cheap, gives us a chance to see a cheap flop for a possible straight or flush draw, and avoids committing more chips to a hand that likely won't hold up post\u2011flop.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have a hand: BTN with 5h7s, stack 224, blinds 1/2. SB posted 1, BB posted 2. No other players. So we are facing a call of 2 to see flop (i.e., just call the BB). Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise to 4 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide action. 5h7s is a weak hand, suited but low. In BTN, can raise to try to steal, but it's a weak hand. However, the BB is Kimi-K2 with 200 chips, and SB is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 192 chips. Actually seat 1 is SB, seat 2 is BB. Both are same opponent? Possibly two different players with same name? They are separate seats.\n\nWe have to consider opponent tendencies. Use recall_opponent_actions: we asked for raises preflop by Kimi-K2, got one: hand 2, preflop, seat 2 (BB) raised to 6. That's a raise from BB. Not much else. Could also check folds etc. But we have limited time. The BB may be aggressive, raising sometimes. Our hand is weak; calling might be okay to see flop cheap? But we are in BTN, we could raise to steal blinds. However 5-7 suited is not a great raise but can be used as a steal if opponent is tight. Not sure about opponent style.\n\nGiven we have 112 BB stack, we can afford to call and see flop, but with such weak hand we risk being out of position postflop (we are in BTN, will be first to act after flop? Actually BTN is after BB, so after flop the action starts with SB (seat1) then BB then BTN, so BTN is last to act preflop, but postflop, the first active player left of the dealer (BTN) is SB (if SB still in). If both SB and BB call, BTN acts first postflop. So we are out of position? Actually dealer acts last preflop, but first postflop. So we will be out of position. So raising with weak hand is risky.\n\nGiven the weak hand, best is to fold or call. Call is cheap 2 chips to see flop, maybe we can hit a straight draw (6-8) or flush draw (if hearts). 5h7s suited hearts, could make flush. But also could be dominated. Typically 5-7 suited is a marginal hand, but in BTN you could limp (call) and see flop cheap. Many players fold to raises. So we could call.\n\nWe need to consider pot odds: pot is 3, call 2 -> pot after call 5, chance to hit a good hand maybe 12%? Not great but okay.\n\nGiven the opponent might raise occasionally, we might want to avoid being raised and stuck with weak hand. So calling is safe.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Also could have pair of 9s, 8s, etc. So we can raise for value. Minimum raise is 2 (so raise to 2? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 2 means we bet 2 chips. That's small. But we could raise bigger to extract value. But we are limited to legal actions: raise (no max given). We should consider stack sizes: opponent 198 chips, we 220. Pot is small (9). We could bet maybe 6-8 to get value. But we need to decide based on tournament stage: we have deep stack 110 BB, can afford to bet. Opponent may call with draws. So we could raise to maybe 8 (approx pot). However we must ensure raise is at least min raise 2 more than current bet? Since amount to call is 0, min raise is 2. So raise to 2 is allowed, but we can raise higher. The system expects a numeric raise_to. We need to decide.\n\nGiven we have a strong hand, we should raise to extract value. Let's maybe raise to 8 chips (so total put in 8). That is about pot size. Reason: value bet.\n\nWe must ensure we have enough chips: yes.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 8, reasoning.\n\n",

But actions show seat5 post_sb 1, seat1 post_bb 2. So maybe they reversed: seat5 is small blind, seat1 is big blind. But they said position BB. Could be error. Anyway amount to call is 1 (the small blind). Since we posted small blind, we need to call 1 to match big blind of 2? Actually after SB and BB posted, the amount to call for the SB is the difference (2-1=1). So we can call 1 to complete. So we can call or raise. Hand is Q5 offsuit hearts. Not a strong hand. In early position (SB) but we are out of position after flop. Should we fold? In SB, Q5 is weak. Many players would fold to avoid playing out of position with weak hand. However we are already half blind; calling 1 is cheap. But we could also raise to steal? Not likely with Q5. Better to just call (complete) and see flop? In tournament with 113 BB, you can afford to limp. But with Q5 off, limp may be okay but could get raised. Better to fold?

We could check and see a turn, maybe bet? With such weak hand, maybe check and hope turn improves.\n\nBut consider tournament dynamics: we have 112.5 BB, deep enough. Opponent 193 chips ~96.5 BB. Both similar. He checked, maybe wants to see free card. If we bet, we could try to steal pot. But we have no made hand, only backdoor flush. Might be a bluff. Minimum raise to 2 (so bet 2). That would be 2 into 4 pot, pot odds 2:4. He could call with many hands like Ace high, etc. Might be okay.\n\nBut we also have the 5h which could give pair 5? Not on board. No.\n\nBetter to check, preserve stack, see turn.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nLegal actions include check. So output.\n\n",

Actually actions list: preflop: seat5 post_sb 1 (small blind). seat1 post_bb 2 (big blind). then seat5 call 1 (to match). seat1 check. flop: seat5 check, seat1 check. So now turn: it's seat5's action first (since they were first to act preflop). So we act now. Amount to call 0, min raise 2, legal actions: fold, check, raise. We have queen high, board heavily coordinated with spades, opponent could have spade flush draw, could have pair, could have straight draws? Not many. Likely they have something better than queen high. Checking is safe. Raising could be a bluff but small pot. Could try to steal pot? Opponent may call with any pair. But we have no showdown value.

So we should check, not bet, because we can't win at showdown unless opponent also has queen high or less (but they would have checked). Could they have a queen? Could they have Qx? They might have queen and check, but they could also have a lower pair like 4s? But they would have bet maybe. However they checked all streets, maybe they are checking with a weak hand, but we cannot profitably bet because we risk being called and losing chips. With pot only 4 chips, a bet of 2 would be fine but we risk losing 2 if called. But we have huge stack relative to pot, but tournament considerations: preserve chips. So best is check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nWe need to output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have data: Seat1 (SB) raised to 8 in hand #6 (preflop). Seat2 (BB) raised to 6 in multiple hands. So both seem willing to raise preflop. We are on button, we can either raise to isolate or just call. 9T suited is a decent hand, can raise to build pot and possibly steal blinds. Opponents may call or 3-bet. Minimum raise is 4 (to total 4). Standard raise size maybe 3x BB = 6, but we could raise to 8 to match SB's previous raise size. Our stack is deep, can raise to 8 (total). That would be a raise of 6 (since we need to put 4 total? Wait amount to call is 2, min raise to 4 total, so raise to 8 would be +6). That's fine.\n\nWe need to consider pot odds: If we raise to 8, pot becomes 3+2+8? Actually we add 8 total, but we already call 2? No, raise to 8 means we put 8 chips total, not additional. So we put 8, pot becomes 3 (existing) + 8 (our raise) = 11 plus any other calls. Opponent may call 2 more (SB) and BB may call 6 more (since they already posted 2). Actually they posted 1 and 2, we raise to 8, they need to call 7 (SB) and 6 (BB) to see flop. That is large. Might discourage them.\n\nGiven their tendencies: BB raises to 6 often, maybe they like to raise from BB with decent hands. SB also raised to 8 previously, maybe they are aggressive.\n\nOur hand 9T suited is good for flop, but not premium. Might want to just call to see flop cheap, but we are on button and can take initiative. However raising may get us all-in if they re-raise. But stack sizes are deep enough.\n\nI think optimal: raise to 8 to isolate BB or SB, leveraging position. Reasoning: hand is strong, position, can win bigger pot, and opponents seem willing to call raises but also may fold.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 8.\n\n",

Since BB posted 2, SB posted 1, then raise to 4 means they added 2? Actually typical: raise to 4 means total bet 4. So they raised 2 more (from 2 to 4). But amount to call is 2 (the difference between 4 and our 2). Minimum raise to 6 (i.e., raise to at least 6 total). So legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nOur hand: K\u2662 3\u2663? Actually 3d Ks: King of spades, 3 of diamonds. So K\u26603\u2666 offsuit, a weak hand. In BB facing a raise from MP (seat 4). Our stack 226 chips, deep 113 BB. Position: BB vs raise from MP (probably early-ish). Opponent's tendencies: from recall, they have raised preflop in hand 11 (raise amount 4) and also called in hand 11 later (call 8). In hand 11 they raised preflop, then called a bet on flop? Actually they called 8 on flop (maybe after someone bet). In hand 11 they also checked flop and turn, then bet river 8. So they can be somewhat aggressive but also passive. Not enough data.\n\nK3 offsuit is a very weak hand, especially out of position. Should fold. No reason to call or raise.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Position: SB, out of position postflop. Hand is decent but not premium. Kc Tc suited is a suited broadway, can make straights, flushes. In early stage tournament, with 112 BB, you can be a bit aggressive but still consider fold vs raise.\n\nOpponent seat4: MiniMax-M2. We don't know tendencies. Could be random. Might be a raise from early position? Actually seat4 is MP? Table seats: seat1 is Kimi-K2 (BB). seat2 folded, seat3 folded, seat4 raise. So seat4 is UTG? Actually seat5 is SB, seat1 BB, seat4 is CO? Wait seats: 1 BB, 2 UTG? But seat numbers not important. But seat4 raising from middle position maybe. Since it's a 5-player? Actually we have seats 1-5, but seats 2 and 3 folded, leaving 3 players: seat4, seat5 (us), seat1 (BB). So seat4 raised from CO (cutoff) or maybe UTG? In any case, raise of 4 is small (2x big blind). So it's a standard opening.\n\nOur hand Kc Tc suited is a decent open-raising hand but we are out of position. Calling is okay to see flop, but could also 3-bet? But we have limited stack but still deep. 3-bet to maybe 12? Might be too aggressive against unknown. Since raise is small, could just call and see flop.\n\nPot odds: need to call 3 into pot 7+? Actually pot before action is 7 (SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 4? Actually raise 4 includes the 2 big blind? The raise to 4 means total bet is 4, so pot now: 1+2+4 =7. To call need 3 more, pot after call would be 10. So pot odds ~3/10 = 30% needed. Hand equity vs random? Kc Tc suited vs unknown range maybe ~20%? So maybe not profitable call.\n\nBut we can consider 3-bet as a bluff/ value. However with 112 BB we can afford to fold marginal hands. I'd lean to fold.\n\nBut we might also consider that opponent's raise could be wide, and we have decent suited connectors. Could call and try to flop. However we are out of position and have many players left. In tournament, preserving stack is important.\n\nThus I think fold.\n\nLet's produce JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have pocket sevens in BB. Preflop action: SB posted 1, BB posted 2 (our blind). Then we raised to 4 (so we opened to 4 total, i.e., 2 more? Actually raise from 2 to 4 total). Then Kimi-K2 (Seat1) raised to 14 (so a 3-bet). So now we face a 3-bet of 14 total, we have put 4 already, need to call 10 more to match 14. Minimum raise to 24 (i.e., re-raise to 24 total). Our stack is 224, deep. Pocket sevens are a medium pair. In BB vs a 3-bet from UTG? Not sure position: Seat1 is likely UTG? Table seats: Seat1 is early position (maybe UTG). Kimi-K2 Thinking likely a tight-ish player? We have recall: they raised preflop to 8 and 12 in previous hands. Those were 3-bets? Actually they raised to 8 and 12 (maybe from SB?). Not much info. We can consider 3-bet size: 14 is about 7x big blind (big blind 2). That's a fairly standard 3-bet. Pocket sevens are a marginal 3-bet defense. Could call to set mine, but set odds are low: need to hit set on flop (prob ~12%). Pot after call would be 14+10 call+ our 4? Actually pot currently: initial pot 21 (includes blinds and our raise). After K's raise to 14, pot is 21 + (14-4)=31? Wait compute: blinds 1+2 =3, we raised to 4 (adding 2 more). So pot after our raise: 3+2=5? Actually raise to 4 means we put 4 total, so contributed 2 extra over blind, pot = 1+2+2 =5? Not sure. But anyway, call 10 adds to pot. Pot odds: call 10 to win maybe ~? If we call, pot will be about 21+10+? Actually after raise to 14, pot includes 14 from K and 4 from us plus 3 blinds =21? That's what they said pot 21 before actions. After K's raise, pot becomes 21+ (14-4)=31. Call 10 adds to pot making 41. So pot odds ~10/41 ~24%. Set odds ~12% => not profitable. So folding is correct. Could also consider 3-bet re-raise, but pocket sevens are not strong enough to 3-bet. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

But calling 3 for a pot of 10 gives pot odds 3/(10+3)=3/13 ~23% needed. Our hand equity vs random hand is low (<20%). So folding is correct.\n\nCheck if any reason to call? Perhaps if opponent is very tight and only bets with strong, then we fold. If opponent is aggressive and often bets with nothing, maybe call to see turn. But we have no outs beyond hitting a six on turn/river. Probability to improve to set: remaining two sixes in deck, 47 unknown cards, chance on turn ~2/47=4.3%, on river if miss turn ~2/46=4.3% again. So low.

          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 7c Js. Opponent in Seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (maybe same as Kimi-K2). They posted BB 2. So we are BB after SB posted 1 and BB posted 2. So preflop we are in BB, facing no raise (just the forced blind). Amount to call is 1 (to match SB? Actually BB already posted 2, SB posted 1, pot 3. Amount to call is 1 to match SB? Wait: In BB, after SB posts 1, BB posts 2, then action goes to UTG etc. But all others folded, so we are last to act preflop with only SB and BB posted. Since we are BB, we have already posted 2, but we can check (i.e., do nothing) or raise. The amount to call is 1 to match SB's 1? Actually SB already posted 1, BB posted 2, so we are already 2 in, so to call we would need to put in 0? Usually if no raise, BB can check. But they say amount to call: 1, maybe because they treat that we need to call SB's 1 to even out? But we already posted 2, which is more than SB's 1, so we are already ahead. In many implementations, amount to call is 0 for BB when no raise. But they show amount to call 1, maybe they consider we can call the SB's 1 to make it even? That seems off. But legal actions include raise. We'll assume we can check (call 0) or raise. They gave amount to call 1, but legal actions: fold, call, raise. So call means put 1 more? That would be weird because then we would put total 3? That would be a raise effectively. But maybe they treat that we need to call SB's 1 to complete the bet. So if we \"call\", we will put 1 chip, making total 3 in pot from us? That seems like a raise but maybe they treat as call. But we can also raise to minimum 4 (total). So we need to decide.\n\nHand 7c Js is a suited connector, decent for BB but not premium. Stack 221 chips (110.5 BB). In early tournament, with 110 BB, we can be flexible. In BB, we can limp (call) or raise. Opponent Kimi-K2 has been raising preflop to 6 (3x BB) in previous hands (hand numbers 2,7,8,16). That suggests they are aggressive, maybe raise from early position? But in this hand they are in seat1 (SB?) Actually seat1 posted SB 1. So they are SB, not raising. So they are not raising now.\n\nWe are BB; we can either check (call 0) or raise. 7c Js is not a hand to limp often; could raise to steal blinds? But we are in BB, and SB is likely to fold to raise. However SB is Kimi-K2, who may be aggressive but not sure. Since we have decent hand, raising could be good to isolate and pick up the pot. Minimum raise to 4 total, meaning raise by 2 chips (since we already have 2 in? Actually total to 4 means we add 2 more). That would be a small raise, about 2x BB. That could be effective.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to raise preflop to 6 in earlier hands, they might be comfortable calling a small raise? But they are SB, they already posted 1, they'd need to call 3 more to match 4 total. That's 3 chips, which is fine. Might call.\n\nWe have 7c Js, suited, potential for straight and flush. In early stage, we might want to see flop cheap. Could also just check and see flop for free. But raising might give us chance to win the pot now, and also define opponent.\n\nGiven stack depth, I'd likely raise to 8 or 10 to apply pressure, but min raise is 4. Could raise larger if allowed? Legal actions only mention raise, not max. Usually you can raise any amount above min. But we need to decide raise_to value. Could raise to 8 (4x BB). That would be a decent raise.\n\nBut we need to consider tournament: 110 BB, not urgent to steal blinds. 7c Js is decent for a steal. I'd raise to 8 chips.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 8.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Opponent (Seat1) called 4 (so they called 4 more to match our raise? Actually we raised to 6, they called 4 (since they already posted 2 big blind? Wait preflop: we are BB, posted 2. Seat1 is SB, posted 1. Then we raise to 6 (so add 4). Seat1 call 4 to match 6. So pot now: before flop: we have 6 (our raise) + 2 (our blind) = 8? Actually our total contribution is 6 (including blind). Opponent contributed 1 (blind) + 4 call =5. So total pot = 8+5 =13? But given pot 12 chips. Slight rounding. Anyway.\n\nNow flop: board T\u2665 2\u2665 3c. Our hand: 7c Js. That's a gutshot straight draw? We have J, board T, we need Q for straight (J Q K A? Actually with J and T, you need Q for straight JQK? Not correct. Let's examine: board T,2,3. Our J gives us open-ended? We have J, board T, we need Q or 9 for straight? Actually 9-J-T? That's not a straight. Straight combos: 9-10-J-Q-K? Not. With J and T, you need Q and K? Not. So we have just a Jack high, no pair, no flush draw (we have clubs, board hearts and club 3c, we have club 7c, board has 3c, no other clubs. So we have a backdoor flush draw (two more clubs needed). Not strong.\n\nOpponent seat1 (Kimi-K2) is the only remaining player. They have stack 182. They are in SB originally, now called preflop. We are in BB. The flop action: we have amount to call 0 (since we are first to act? Actually after preflop, it's our turn? The flop order: SB (seat1) acts first, then BB (seat5). The actions list not provided for flop. So it's our turn with amount to call 0. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. So we can check or raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on opponent tendencies. Use memory: maybe recall opponent's flop raise frequency. Let's query opponent's flop raise actions. Already did recall_opponent_actions with raise on flop, got none. Could be because not enough data. Let's search observations for Kimi-K2 raising flop.Let's try recall_my_hands? Might not help. Probably we have limited data. We can assume opponent is unknown.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, we likely should check. However, we could consider a small raise as a bluff to steal pot. Opponent's stack is 182, pot is 12. A raise to maybe 12 or 15 could be effective. But we are deep stack 108 BB. In tournament early stage, we can preserve chips. Check is safe.\n\nConsider potential: we have backdoor flush draw, maybe can see turn. So check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

River check? Actually we have amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. We can check or raise. Pot is 12 chips, stacks are large relative. We have J high, likely losing to any pair on board? Board has no pair, but opponent could have a pair like K, T, 9, etc. They could have Ace-high, etc. Our J is not strong.

No, they'd need to call 2 more to match BB's 4. So they call 2, making pot 8 (2+4+2). So we are in BB with amount to call 0 (since SB just called). So we can check or raise. Hand 7s8h is suited connectors, decent for stealing? In BB, after SB just called, it's a limp. We are out of position after flop (SB first). With 7-8 suited, could consider a raise to isolate. Stack 53 BB, can raise to 8 min, which is 2BB. That's a small raise, but could be okay. However SB just limped, likely weak. Raising could win pot now or set up flop. 7-8 suited is a decent hand for limping or raising? In early tournament, with 53 BB, maybe raise to 12-15? Minimum raise is 8. Raising to 8 is small, may get re-raised? But SB already called, they'd need to re-raise. Could also just check and see flop. But 7-8 suited is a speculative hand; playing postflop from out of position is tricky. However with 53 BB, we can afford to see flop cheap. The pot is 8, we can see flop for free if check.

          "reasoning_content": "We have flop: board 8s Ah 9s. Our hand: 7s 8h. So we have pair of eights (top pair? Actually board has 8s and 9s and Ace. Our 8h gives us a pair of eights, plus a flush draw (spades: we have 7s, board has 8s and 9s spades, need two more spades for flush). Also we have open-ended straight draw? Cards: 7,8,9 on board, we have 7 and 8, so we have 7-8-9, need 6 or 10 for straight. We have 7,8 so we have gutshot? Actually we have 7 and 8, board 8, A,9. So we have 7-8-8-9-A. Straight possibilities: need 6 for 6-7-8-9-10? No 10 not present. Need 10 for 8-9-10-J-Q? Not. So we have open-ended? Not. We have a gutshot for 6-7-8-9-10 missing 6 or 10, but 10 not on board. So need 6 or 10. Not strong.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 bet 6 into pot 14 (so pot now 20). We are in BB with 212 chips. We have decent equity: we have pair, flush draw (2 outs to flush? Actually we have 7s, board has 8s,9s. So we have two spades on board? Wait board: 8s Ah 9s. That's two spades (8s,9s). We have 7s. So we have three spades total, need one more spade for flush. So 9 outs (13 spades left minus 3 known = 10? Actually spades in deck 13, we see 8s,9s,7s = 3, so 10 outs). Also we have a gutshot for straight (6 or 10). So total outs maybe 12 (excluding Aces and other combos). So equity ~ 12 outs on turn+river ~ about 24% maybe.\n\nPot odds: call 6 to win pot 20+6 = 26? Actually pot before call is 20 (14+6). To call 6 you get pot 20+6=26. So pot odds 6/26 = 23% required. Our equity maybe ~24% so borderline call. Also we have implied odds maybe if we hit flush we can win more chips. Opponent's stack: MiniMax-M2 has 211 chips, similar. So we could win about 200 chips. So implied odds good.\n\nWe could also consider raising. Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise total to 12). That would be raise of 6 more (total 12). That would be a semi-bluff maybe. Does opponent have tendency? Past recall shows only one flop bet of 3 in hand 18. Not much data.\n\nGiven we have decent equity and pot odds just barely favorable, calling is reasonable. Raising could be risky as we may be behind if opponent has Ace or 9 or pair. But we have top pair? Actually board Ace, we have pair of eights, opponent could have Ace high, or 9, or 8, or straight draws. Raising might isolate.\n\nI think call.\n\nThus JSON: action call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Our 7 gives us open-ended straight draw? Actually need 6 or T to complete straight. We have 7, so we have 7-8-9, need 6 for 6-7-8-9 or T for 7-8-9-T. So we have gutshot? It's open-ended? 7-8-9, missing 6 or T, both would give straight. So we have an open-ended straight draw (two outs). Also we have a flush draw? Board has two spades (8s,9s). We have 7s, so we have three spades, need one more spade for flush. So we have both a flush draw and straight draw, plus a pair of eights. That's a strong draw.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) checked on turn after betting flop 6, we called. So they might be weak or also drawing. Their range: could be Ace, maybe 8x, maybe 9x, maybe flush draws, etc. They checked turn, maybe they have nothing.\n\nPot is 20. No bet on turn yet. We have option to check or raise. Minimum raise is 6 (so raise to 6? Actually raise to total 6? Wait amount to call is 0, min raise to 6 means we need to put at least 6 total. So raise to 6 chips. That's a small raise (30% pot). Could also raise larger.\n\nWe have strong draws, we could semi-bluff. Opponent's stack 211, ours 206. So we can afford.\n\nConsider tournament stage: 51.5 BB, still decent. Should we bet to build pot and protect? Opponent checked, maybe they are weak. A bet could force folds of weaker hands and get value from draws. Also we can get folds of Ace-high that might call? Actually Ace-high may call a bet? Possibly.\n\nGiven we have good equity, a semi-bluff raise is good. Raise to maybe 12 (60% pot) to apply pressure. But min raise is 6; we could raise to 12 (legal). What is typical? Might want to size about half pot: pot 20, half is 10. So raise to 10-12.\n\nCheck could give free card on river but risk opponent betting later. Better to take initiative.\n\nThus action: raise to 12 (or 10). Choose 12.\n\nWe need to ensure raise is legal (>= min). Yes.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Actually board has 8s, we have 7s 8h, so we have top pair? Board: 8s (spade), Ah, 9s, 2c, 6h. Our 8h pairs with board 8s => pair of eights. Also we have a straight draw? Board: A, 9, 8, 6, 2. Our 7 gives us 6-7-8-9 straight? Actually we have 6 on board, 7 in hand, 8 on board, 9 on board => that's a straight 6-7-8-9-10? No, need 10 for that. 5-6-7-8-9 would be straight, we have 5? No. So we have no straight. We have flush draw? Board has two spades (8s, 9s). Our 7s is spade, gives three spades. Not a flush. So our hand is just a pair of eights, which is second pair behind Ace high. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 24 on river. Let's consider opponent's range.\n\nPreflop: opponent (Seat 4) posted small blind 2, then called 2 (big blind) preflop. So they have a wide range, likely any two cards.\n\nFlop: board 8s Ah 9s. Opponent bet 6 into pot 12? Pot after preflop: we had 4 (bb) + 2 (sb) + call 2 = 8? Actually preflop: SB 2, BB 4, others folded, SB called 2, BB checked. So pot 8. Flop bet 6, we called 6, pot 20. Flop board: 8s Ah 9s. Opponent bet 6 (small). Could be many hands: top pair Aces, middle pair 9s, 8s, draws, etc.\n\nTurn: board 2c, turn bet 12 by us (BB) after opponent checked. So we bet 12 into pot 20 (after flop). We have 8 pair, maybe we think we are ahead of many draws? Opponent called 12.\n\nRiver: board 6h. Opponent bets 24 into pot (68). So pot after turn: pre-turn pot 20 + our bet 12 + call 12 = 44. River bet 24, pot 68 (makes sense). Opponent's bet 24 is about 35% of pot.\n\nOur hand: 8 pair, but opponent could have Ace (A? with kicker), could have 9, could have 8 (set?), could have straight draws that missed, could have flush draws. Let's consider opponent's possible holdings.\n\nGiven they called our turn bet 12, they might have a hand that wants to see river. Could be Ace, could be 9, could be 8, could be draws.\n\nNow river board: 6h. Does any new hand appear? Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9 would be a straight if opponent has 5. They don't have 5 (unknown). 6-7-8-9-10 would need 10. Not present. So only possible new hand is maybe a pair of 6s (if they have 6). Could be a flush?

Wait board has two tens, one 2. So they have two 2s in hand + board 2 = three 2s, plus board has two tens, so they have a full house: 2s over Ts. Similarly if they have T-T, they'd have quads? Actually they'd have four tens (two on board + two in hand) => quads.\n\nThus many possible strong hands.\n\nWe are in BB, after preflop raise 30 (re-raise) and opponent called. So opponent (Seat 2) has 161 chips, presumably UTG? Actually seat 2 is after seat1 (SB). Seat 2 is in position? Seat order: SB seat1, BB seat5, seat2 is UTG? So seat2 is under the gun (first to act preflop). They raised to 12 then we 3-bet to 30, they called. So they likely have a strong hand.\n\nNow flop: we are first to act? Actually action order after flop: SB is out (folded), BB (us) acts first? In Texas Hold'em, after flop, action starts with first active player left of button, which is SB if still in, else BB. So we act first.\n\nWe have pot 64, we have 30 in pot? Actually preflop: SB posted 2, BB posted 4, raise to 12 (seat2), we 3-bet to 30 (so we added 30-4=26? Actually we posted 30 total). Then seat2 called 18 (to match 30). So pot after preflop: SB 2 + BB 4 + seat2 12 + us 30 + seat2 18 = 66? Let's compute: SB 2, BB 4, seat2 initial raise 12, we 30, seat2 call 18. Total = 2+4+12+30+18 = 66. But the given pot is 64, maybe small rounding. Anyway pot ~64.\n\nNow flop: we can check or raise. Opponent likely has a strong hand given 3-bet preflop. Could be AK, AQ, AA, KK, etc. With board T T 2, our K K is overpair, good but board paired.\n\nWe need to consider opponent range: preflop they raised, we 3-bet, they called. Their calling range could be: strong hands that like to call 3-bet: TT, JJ, 99, AK, AQ, maybe AJs, KQs, etc. Also some suited connectors maybe. But they are first to act preflop, they may be tight.\n\nNow flop with T T 2: If they have TT, they'd have quads (very strong). If they have 2x, they'd have trips. If they have a set of something else? No.\n\nIf they have AK, they have overpair (K) but board is paired, they have K? Actually they have AK, they'd have a King, so also overpair but they have Ace kicker, not relevant.\n\nOur hand is strong but vulnerable.\n\nWe could check and see what they do. If they bet,"

We have KKs, so currently we have top pair (K) but board is TT, we have overpair? Actually we have KKs, board TT2, we have overpair (Kings) but board has a pair of tens, so we have a set? No, we have no ten, so we have overpair to the board pair (tens). The opponent could have a ten (makes trips) or a full house (if they have a ten plus a ten? impossible) or a hand like AK (makes top pair K with top kicker). Actually we have KK, opponent could have TT (makes set). Could have T? Actually they could have a 2 for a full house? board 2s, they could have 2? That would be trips 2s, not full house. Or they could have a hand like Kx (makes pair of K, but we have KK). So we are ahead of any hand except a set of tens or a full house (if they have a T plus something else). Also a straight? board has T,2,T, no straight possibilities. So opponent's bet 30 into pot 94. Pot before bet: 94. They bet 30, making pot 124 after bet (if we call). They bet ~0.32 pot. That's a small bet, maybe they are probing with a weak hand or they have a draw? But there are no draws (board is paired tens, only possible draw is a backdoor flush? No clubs or hearts? Actually suits unknown. Could be flush draw if they have two clubs and board has clubs? board: Td (diamonds?), 2s (spades), Ts (diamonds). So there are two diamonds on board (Td, Ts). So a flush draw would need two diamonds in hand. That's possible. So they could have a diamond draw, but they bet small maybe to set price. Also they could have a ten (set) and want to protect, but they'd bet larger perhaps. Could be a weak hand like a gutshot? Not many.\n\nOur stack 164, opponent stack unknown? Not given but they have 131 chips initially. After preflop they have 131 - (call 18 + bet 30?) Actually they posted 2? Wait they are Seat2 (UTG?) They posted SB? Actually seat2 is not small blind; seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Actually preflop actions: seat5 post_sb 2 (so seat5 posted small blind). seat1 post_bb 4 (so seat1 posted big blind). So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So seat2 is UTG? Actually seat2 raised 12 (so raise to 12). So seat2 is the raiser. So seat2's stack after preflop: they raised to 12 (they put 12 total, including posting? They posted nothing before). Then seat5 (SB) raised to 30 (so they put 30 total). seat2 called 18 more (since they already put 12, they need to add 18 to match 30). So now pot: SB 2+30? Actually SB posted 2, then raised to 30, so total SB contribution = 30 (includes the 2). BB posted 4 and folded. So contributions: seat2: 12+18=30, seat5:30. So pot = 60. But pot listed as 94? Hmm maybe there were antes or other players? Actually seat1 had 189 chips folded, but posted big blind 4 and folded preflop, that adds 4 to pot. So pot = 30+30+4=64. Not 94. Something off. But anyway.\n\nNow flop bet 30. Our stack 164, opponent stack maybe around 131 - 30 = 101? Actually they have 131 chips initially, they put 30 preflop, leaving 101. So they bet 30, leaving 71. So we can call 30, leaving 134.\n\nDecision: With KK over TT, we are ahead of most hands except set. Opponent's bet is small, could be a draw or a weak hand. Should we raise? Could we extract value? Raising to 60 (minimum) would be 30 more, making pot bigger. But opponent might fold weaker hands. Since we have strong hand, we can consider raising to protect against draws, but the board is paired, so a raise also builds pot. Opponent could have a ten (set) and would likely call or raise. If they have a draw, they may call."

But anyway.\n\nNow flop bet 30. Our stack 164, opponent stack maybe around 131 - 30 = 101? Actually they have 131 chips initially, they put 30 preflop, leaving 101. So they bet 30, leaving 71. So we can call 30, leaving 134.\n\nDecision: With KK over TT, we are ahead of most hands except set. Opponent's bet is small, could be a draw or a weak hand. Should we raise? Could we extract value? Raising to 60 (minimum) would be 30 more, making pot bigger. But opponent might fold weaker hands. Since we have strong hand, we can consider raising to protect against draws, but the board is paired, so a raise also builds pot. Opponent could have a ten (set) and would likely call or raise. If they have a draw, they may call.",

          "content": "We need to decide action on turn? Wait actions list ends at flop. Actually we are at turn now. The board: Td 2s Ts 3s, turn card not shown yet. The actions listed are up to flop. Now it's turn, and amount to call is 0, min raise 30, legal actions: fold, check, raise. We need to decide.\n\nWe have Ks Kh, pocket kings. Board: T\u2663? Actually Td (ten diamonds?), 2s (two spades), Ts (ten spades), 3s (three spades). So board has two tens, a 2, a 3, with three spades (2s, Ts, 3s). So there is a possible flush draw (spades). Also a possible full house draw for opponent (if they have a ten, they'd have trips, but we have kings). Opponent (Seat 2) raised preflop to 12, we 3-bet to 30, they called. Flop: we checked, they bet 30, we raised to 60, they called. So pot now after flop: Let's compute: Preflop: blinds 2+4 =6, plus raise 12 (to 12?), Actually seat2 raise to 12 (so they put 12 total?), seat5 raise to 30 (so they put 30 total). So preflop pot: 2+4+12+30 =48? plus seat2 call 18 (to match 30) adds 18, seat5 already 30, seat1 folded. So preflop pot = 48 + 18 =66? Wait compute: SB 2, BB 4, raise to 12 means seat2 puts 12 total (so additional 10 beyond BB). Then seat5 raise to 30 (so adds 26 beyond 4). So contributions: seat2 12, seat5 30, seat1 4 (BB). So total = 2+4+12+30 =48. Then seat2 call 18 to match 30, adds 18, so total =66. Yes preflop pot 66.\n\nFlop: board 4 cards? Actually flop is three cards: Td 2s Ts. We check, seat2 bets 30, we raise to 60 (so we put 60 total, additional 30 beyond 30). So seat2 calls 30. So contributions: seat2 bet 30, we raise 60 (so we added 60), seat2 call 30. So total added = 30+60+30 =120. Pot now = 66+120 =186. The given pot before turn is 184 chips, close enough maybe rounding.\n\nNow turn: unknown card. We have K\u2660? Actually we have Ks Kh (king spade and king heart). So we have a pair of kings, overpair to board (board currently has tens). Also we have a backdoor flush draw? We have spade king, board has 2s, Ts, 3s; we have one spade (Ks). So we have 4 spades total after turn if turn is spade, giving us flush draw? Actually we have 4 spades (Ks + three on board) = 4, need one more spade on river for flush. So backdoor flush draw.\n\nOpponent's range: preflop raise then call 3-bet, so they likely have strong hands: maybe broadway, suited connectors, pocket pairs, etc. On flop, they bet 30 into pot 66 (approx 0.45 pot). We raised, they called. That suggests they have decent hand, maybe top pair, overpair, set, two pair, straight draw, flush draw, etc.\n\nBoard: T T 2 3 (two spades). Opponent could have a hand like AT (top pair), TT (set), 33 (set), 23 (straight), 44 (maybe), 55, 66, 77, 88, 99 (overpair), AK, AQ, etc. They could also have spade draws: A\u2660? etc.\n\nWe have overpair Kings, which is strong but vulnerable to sets (TT, 33, 22? Actually board has 2, not a pair). There's a set of tens possible. Also possible straight draws: 9-8, 8-7, 7-6, 6-5? Actually board T T 2 3: straight possibilities: A K Q J? No. The board is paired tens, low cards. Straight combos: 9-8? No because need 4 cards in sequence. 9-8-7? Not possible. So only straight is maybe A K Q J 10? Not possible. So no straight draw.\n\nThus main threat is set of"

          "content": "We need to decide action. Turn card unknown, but we need to decide based on typical play. With overpair kings, pot is 184, stack 104 (26 BB). We are short stacked relative to pot? Actually stack 104, pot 184, we are slightly less than pot, but still have 104 chips left (including our already invested? Actually stack after flop: we had 104 start, we invested 30 preflop, 60 on flop raise = 30 extra? Actually we raised to 60, meaning we put total 60 on flop, which is 30 more than call. So we invested total 30 (preflop) + 60 = 90. So remaining stack = 104 - 90 = 14? Wait that seems off. Let's compute correctly: Starting stack 104. Preflop we posted 2 (SB) and then raised to 30 total, meaning we added 28 more? Actually we posted 2, then raise to 30 means total contribution 30, so we added 28 additional chips. So after preflop, our stack = 104 - 30 = 74.\n\nFlop: we checked (no chips), opponent bet 30, we raise to 60 total (so we put 60 total into pot on flop). We had already 30 in pot, so we add 30 more. So after flop, our stack = 74 - 30 = 44.\n\nThus we have 44 chips left. Pot is 184 (including our contributions). So we are short stack relative to pot, but still have 44 chips.\n\nNow turn: amount to call 0, min raise 30, legal actions fold, check, raise. We can raise up to our stack (44). Minimum raise is 30, so we could raise to 30 (i.e., add 30 more). That would be a raise to total bet of 30? Actually amount to call is 0, so raise to 30 means we bet 30 chips. That would be a continuation bet.\n\nGiven we have 44 chips left, raising to 30 is possible, leaving us 14 chips behind (potential all-in later). Could also go all-in for 44.\n\nConsider opponent's likely range: they called our flop raise, so they may have a hand like TT (set), or maybe a strong top pair like AT, KT, QT, etc. Our overpair kings is strong but vulnerable to TT set. If opponent has TT, they'd have set and would likely bet/raise. They bet 30 on flop, we raised, they called. If they have set, they'd likely raise on turn if board pairs again? But board currently has two tens, so set is already there. Turn could be another ten (making quads) or something else.\n\nIf turn is a low card, we might want to protect our kings by betting. Our stack is short, so we could go all-in now to protect. Opponent's stack is 101 chips originally, after flop they have contributed: preflop 12, flop 30+30=60, total 72. So they have 101-72=29 chips left. Actually they have 101 chips total at start, they put 12 preflop, 30 bet, 30 call = 72, leaving 29. So opponent is short stacked too! Wait they have 101 chips initially, after flop they have 29 left. So both are short.\n\nThus we both are short and near the bubble? Anyway, we have 44 left, opponent 29 left. So on turn, opponent can only call up to 29. If we bet 30, they cannot call full, they'd have to go all-in for 29. So we could raise all-in for 44, they can call all-in for 29 (they are short). That would be a push.\n\nGiven pot 184, we have 44 left, opponent 29 left. If we go all-in, we risk 44 to win pot 184 + opponent's 29 = 213? Actually pot will be 184 + 44 (our bet) + 29 (opponent call) = 257. So we risk 44 to win 257, ~5.8:1. That's good if we think we are ahead > 15% equity. With Ks Kh vs opponent's range (including TT set, maybe AK, AQ, AT, KQ, etc.), our equity maybe around 70% vs many combos, but set TT would beat us. Set TT probability given they called preflop and flop raise: they could have TT (3 combos left after we have KK). They could also have 33 (but board has 3). Actually board has 3s, so 33 set possible but they would have 33 (2 combos). They could have 22 (pair of 2s)"

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action. Turn card unknown, but we need to decide based on typical play. With overpair kings, pot is 184, stack 104 (26 BB). We are short stacked relative to pot? Actually stack 104, pot 184, we are slightly less than pot, but still have 104 chips left (including our already invested? Actually stack after flop: we had 104 start, we invested 30 preflop, 60 on flop raise = 30 extra? Actually we raised to 60, meaning we put total 60 on flop, which is 30 more than call. So we invested total 30 (preflop) + 60 = 90. So remaining stack = 104 - 90 = 14? Wait that seems off. Let's compute correctly: Starting stack 104. Preflop we posted 2 (SB) and then raised to 30 total, meaning we added 28 more? Actually we posted 2, then raise to 30 means total contribution 30, so we added 28 additional chips. So after preflop, our stack = 104 - 30 = 74.\n\nFlop: we checked (no chips), opponent bet 30, we raise to 60 total (so we put 60 total into pot on flop). We had already 30 in pot, so we add 30 more. So after flop, our stack = 74 - 30 = 44.\n\nThus we have 44 chips left. Pot is 184 (including our contributions). So we are short stack relative to pot, but still have 44 chips.\n\nNow turn: amount to call 0, min raise 30, legal actions fold, check, raise. We can raise up to our stack (44). Minimum raise is 30, so we could raise to 30 (i.e., add 30 more). That would be a raise to total bet of 30? Actually amount to call is 0, so raise to 30 means we bet 30 chips. That would be a continuation bet.\n\nGiven we have 44 chips left, raising to 30 is possible, leaving us 14 chips behind (potential all-in later). Could also go all-in for 44.\n\nConsider opponent's likely range: they called our flop raise, so they may have a hand like TT (set), or maybe a strong top pair like AT, KT, QT, etc. Our overpair kings is strong but vulnerable to TT set. If opponent has TT, they'd have set and would likely bet/raise. They bet 30 on flop, we raised, they called. If they have set, they'd likely raise on turn if board pairs again? But board currently has two tens, so set is already there. Turn could be another ten (making quads) or something else.\n\nIf turn is a low card, we might want to protect our kings by betting. Our stack is short, so we could go all-in now to protect. Opponent's stack is 101 chips originally, after flop they have contributed: preflop 12, flop 30+30=60, total 72. So they have 101-72=29 chips left. Actually they have 101 chips total at start, they put 12 preflop, 30 bet, 30 call = 72, leaving 29. So opponent is short stacked too! Wait they have 101 chips initially, after flop they have 29 left. So both are short.\n\nThus we both are short and near the bubble? Anyway, we have 44 left, opponent 29 left. So on turn, opponent can only call up to 29. If we bet 30, they cannot call full, they'd have to go all-in for 29. So we could raise all-in for 44, they can call all-in for 29 (they are short). That would be a push.\n\nGiven pot 184, we have 44 left, opponent 29 left. If we go all-in, we risk 44 to win pot 184 + opponent's 29 = 213? Actually pot will be 184 + 44 (our bet) + 29 (opponent call) = 257. So we risk 44 to win 257, ~5.8:1. That's good if we think we are ahead > 15% equity. With Ks Kh vs opponent's range (including TT set, maybe AK, AQ, AT, KQ, etc.), our equity maybe around 70% vs many combos, but set TT would beat us. Set TT probability given they called preflop and flop raise: they could have TT (3 combos left after we have KK). They could also have 33 (but board has 3). Actually board has 3s, so 33 set possible but they would have 33 (2 combos). They could have 22 (pair of 2s)",

Seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised 14 in hand 17. So they sometimes raise. But currently they have not acted yet. We are facing just the BB's 4 (call). Actually SB posted 2, BB posted 4.

So only opponent is in UTG (maybe position after BB). So we are in BB facing a call from early position. Our hand 6c9h is weak. We could check and see flop cheap. But we are out of position post-flop (SB is out, only opponent). Actually we are BB, opponent is in UTG (they are in early position but after flop they will be first to act preflop? In heads-up, the dealer is SB? In heads-up, the dealer posts small blind and acts first preflop. But we are BB, seat5, so seat3 is in the big blind? Wait confusion. In heads-up, the dealer is SB and acts first preflop, then BB acts second. But we have SB posted by seat4, but seat4 folded. So we are BB vs UTG who called. So after preflop, the action on flop will be to the caller (seat3) first, then us (BB). So we are out of position. With 6c9h, it's a weak hand, likely fold. But we already posted BB. The amount to call is 0, we can check. Should we check? If we check, we see flop cheap, could see a cheap flop. But 6c9h is a speculative hand with limited potential. In tournament with 69.5 BB, preserving stack is important. Against a single opponent who called from early position (tight?), we might want to fold if we think they have a better hand.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Board: 7c Th Ac. Our hand 6c 9h. So we have gutshot straight draw? Actually board has 7,10,A. Our hole cards 6 and 9 give us an open-ended straight draw? Let's see possible straights: 6-7-8-9-10 would be straight if we have 8, but we have 6 and 9, board has 7,10. So we have 6-7-8-9-10 missing 8. Also 9-10-J-Q-K? Not. So we have gutshot: need 8 to complete 6-7-8-9-10. Also we have backdoor flush draw? We have 6c and board has 7c, so one club on board, we have club, need two more clubs on turn and river for flush. Not strong.\n\nWe have no pair. So currently just gutshot and backdoor flush. Not much.\n\nOpponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) called preflop 4 (small blind). So they have some hand, maybe decent. On flop, they haven't acted yet (they are the only opponent left). It's their turn after us? Actually order: SB folded, BB checked, then UTG? Actually seat 3 is UTG? But they are after BB? Preflop they called. Now flop, action goes to seat 3 first (since they are earlier in order?). Usually after flop, first active player left of button? In BB, the flop action starts with first player left of button (SB) if still in. SB folded, so next is seat 3 (UTG). So they act first. So we are after them. So we have amount to call 0, meaning they have checked? Actually we don't know their action yet. The state shows amount to call 0, meaning it's our turn and no bet yet. So they must have checked. So we can check or raise.\n\nGiven weak hand, we should probably check. Raise would be a bluff. Could be okay if we think they are weak. But we have limited stack 278, pot 10, raising to minimum 4 (i.e., raise to 4 total? Actually raise to total amount 4? Minimum raise to 4 meaning raise amount? Usually min raise is 4, meaning you put total 4? But we already have 0 to call, so raising to 4 puts 4 chips in. That's small.\n\nGiven we have a gutshot, maybe we can try to semi-bluff raise to apply pressure. Opponent's stack 153, they could fold many hands. However tournament considerations: we have decent stack (69 BB) and opponent 153 (38 BB). We could try to steal pot. But risk: if they call, we are left with a weak draw. Pot odds: If we raise 4, pot becomes 14, they call 4, pot 18, we have 2 outs (8). Actually we have 4 outs? Straight draw: need 8. There are four 8s, but one may be on board? No 8 on board. So 4 outs. Also flush draw: need two clubs, but only one more club needed for flush? Actually we have 6c, board has 7c, need two more clubs for flush, so need two clubs on turn and river, not immediate. So only straight outs 4. Chance to hit on turn or river about 8% (4/47 + 4/46). So not great. So a raise may be unprofitable if called.\n\nBetter to check and see turn. So action: check.\n\nThus JSON.",

Let's see: possible straight combos: 8-9-10-J-Q? Not relevant. With 6-9 we have 6-7-8-9-10? We need 8 to complete 6-7-8-9-10 straight. That's a gutshot (need 8). Also we have backdoor flush draws? We have clubs 6c, board has 7c, Ac. That's two clubs, we have one club, need two more clubs. Not strong.\n\nWe have Ace high, but board has Ace, so we have pair of Aces (board). Our hand does not improve; we have Ace high (kicker 9). Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 6 into pot 16, so pot will be 22 after call. Pot odds: need to call 6 to win 22 (including call) = 6/(22) = ~27% needed. Our equity with gutshot? With 8 outs (four 8s) plus maybe some combos for runner-runner flush? But primary outs: 8 outs for straight. Also two clubs? Actually we have 6c, board clubs: 7c, Ac. So we have a flush draw? Need two more clubs, but we only have one club, need two clubs on turn and river. That's not immediate. So outs maybe 8. Probability to hit on turn or river: about 15% (8/47 \u224817% for turn, plus if miss then 8/46 \u224817% for river, combined ~30%). So equity maybe ~30% against a single opponent's bet. Pot odds 27% so call is marginally profitable. Consider opponent's tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 flop bet amounts 8 and 5 in previous hands. Those are small bets relative to pot. Could be continuation bet with weak hand, maybe they have Ace or something. Our hand is weak. Could also consider raising? Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise to 12 total). That would be 6 more.

Board: 7,10,A. So we have gutshot? 6-7-8-9-10 would be straight, missing 8. So we have 6 and 9, we have 6-7-8-9-10 straight draw needs 8. Not present. Also we have pair? No. So we have just 6-high, no pair. The board has Ace high. We have backdoor flush? We have club 6c, so we have four clubs? Actually we have 6c, board clubs: 7c, Ac, 4c = three clubs. So we have four clubs total (6c + three board) = four clubs, we have a flush draw (needs any club). So we have a nut flush draw? The Ace of clubs is on board, so the nut flush is Ace-high flush, but we have 6c, so we would have 6-high flush if hits, but Ace is on board, so any club would give us a flush with Ace high? Actually flush ranking: highest card determines. Since board has Ace of clubs, any flush will have Ace high, regardless of our club. So we cannot make a higher flush than board; but board already has Ace, so any club on turn/river will give everyone a flush with Ace high. So we have a flush draw but not the nut? Actually it's the nut flush because the Ace is on board, so the best possible flush is Ace-high, which is already on board; we cannot have a higher flush than board; but if a club hits, the board will have four clubs including Ace, making the best hand a flush with Ace high; all players with a club will share same flush; but we could have a higher kicker? Flush ranking uses highest cards in hand beyond board? For flush, you consider the best five clubs. If board has Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten clubs, that's straight flush; but here board only has Ace, 7, 4 clubs. If a club hits, we will have five clubs: Ace, 7, 4, 6, X. Our kicker is 6. If opponent has Kc, they'd have Ace, K, 7, 4, X (maybe). So we could be outdrawn. So it's not the nut flush.\n\nWe are on turn. The pot is 22. Opponent (Seat 3) DeepSeek-V3.2 bet? Actually actions: flop: seat3 bet 6, seat5 call 6. So after flop, pot 22? Wait preflop pot: 2+4+4 =10? Actually preflop: SB 2, BB 4, call 4 by seat3, so pot 2+4+4 =10. Flop: seat5 check, seat3 bet 6, seat5 call 6. So pot now: 10+6+6 =22. Yes.\n\nNow turn: board adds a card (unknown from description). Actually we have turn card not shown. Wait board: 7c Th Ac 4c. That's 4 cards, so turn is 4c. So turn card is 4c (club). So board now: clubs: 7c, Ac, 4c. So we have flush draw now 4 clubs.\n\nNow it's our turn? Actually after flop, seat3 bet 6, we called. Now turn action: Who acts first? Usually the player left of dealer (SB) acts first preflop, then after flop, the first active player left of dealer acts first. Seat 3 is DeepSeek, seat5 is us. Who is seat? Seats: seat1 Kimi, seat2 Kimi, seat3 DeepSeek, seat4 MiniMax folded, seat5 us. Dealer? Not given. But we are BB, seat5. The SB is seat4 (post_sb 2) but folded preflop. So after flop, the first active player left of dealer? If dealer is seat? Not given. But actions show flop: seat5 check first, then seat3 bet. So seat5 acted first on flop. So on turn, seat5 acts first again? Likely yes. So now it's our turn on turn, amount to call is 0 (since no bet yet). Minimum raise to 6 (pot 22? Actually minimum raise is size of previous bet? Usually it's at least the size of the bet on that street, which was 6. So raise to 6? Actually raise to at least pot? The minimum raise is previous bet amount plus"

So about 9 outs for flush (13 clubs total, we have 1, board 3, so remaining 9). Also maybe a gutshot 8 for straight (needs 8). That's 4 outs (four 8s). Some overlap with clubs (8c counted already). So total outs approx 12? Actually 8c is both flush and straight, but that's fine. So about 12 outs. Turn to river: two cards left. Approx equity ~ 12*2/47 = ~51%? Actually using approximate: 12 outs, chance to hit by river = 1 - ( (39/47)*(38/46) ) = about 1 - (0.8298*0.8261) = 1 - 0.685 = 0.315. So ~31% chance to improve. Not great.\n\nOpponent just called our flop call, so they likely have something like Ace high, maybe pair, maybe draw. Their bet on flop was 6 into pot 10 (post-flop pot 10). That's a small bet, maybe they have a hand like Ace, or a draw, or a weak pair. They called our call, indicating they are okay.\n\nNow turn: board 4c adds another club, giving opponent also a club draw? They may have clubs. They might have Aces. Our hand is weak. We have 272 chips, stack decent. Pot 22. No bet yet. We can check or bet/raise. Considering our equity ~31% and pot odds if they bet. If we bet, we could represent a strong hand (maybe Ace). But we have no pair. Might be okay to check and see river. If we check, opponent may bet; we can decide then.\n\nCheck is legal (amount to call 0). Raising is also legal but we need raise_to at least 6 (minimum raise). Should we raise? Probably not, as we have weak hand.\n\nThus choose \"check\".",

Raising would be ineffective given our weak equity, and folding preserves our stack in this deep\u2011stack tournament situation.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Our hand: 6c 9h. Board: 7c Th Ac 4c. So we have 6c 9h, board has clubs: 7c Th Ac 4c. So we have a flush draw? We have 6c, so we have two clubs on board (7c, Ac, 4c) actually three clubs? Wait board: 7c, Th, Ac, 4c. That's three clubs: 7c, Ac, 4c. Our hand has 6c, so we have four clubs total, need one more club for flush. So we have a flush draw (any club). Also straight possibilities: board has A, T, 7, 4. Our hand 6,9 gives possible straight draw? We have 6,9. Combine with board: 4-5-6-7-8? Not there. Could get 8? Not. 9-10-J-Q-K? Not. So only flush draw.\n\nOpponent (Seat 3) DeepSeek-V3.2 bet 12 on turn after we checked. Preflop they called 4 (so they have something). Flop they bet 6, we called. So they are showing aggression.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: Opponent has 135 chips left. Pot currently 34 + 6 (flop bet) + 6 call = 46? Wait pot after flop: Preflop pot: 4 (bb) + 4 (call) = 8? Actually preflop: seat5 posted bb 4, seat3 called 4 => pot 8. Flop: seat5 check, seat3 bet 6, seat5 call 6 => pot adds 12, total pot 20. Turn: seat5 check, seat3 bet 12 => pot will be 32 after call. So currently pot before turn bet: 20. Opponent bets 12, making pot 32 if called.\n\nOur stack: 272, opponent 135. So we have deep stack.\n\nWe need to decide: call, raise, or fold. We have a flush draw with 4 outs? Actually clubs left: clubs in deck: 13 total, board has 3 clubs, we have 1 club = 4 clubs accounted. Remaining clubs = 9. But one of those clubs is the Ace? Already on board. So we have 9 clubs left. However some may be dead (opponent may hold clubs). So approximate outs = 9. Turn to river: we have one card to hit. Probability ~ 9/46 = 19.6% chance to hit on river.\n\nPot odds: To call 12 to win pot of 32 (including opponent's bet). Actually pot after call will be 20 + 12*2 = 44? Let's compute: pot before turn bet = 20. Opponent bets 12, we call 12, pot becomes 44. So we call 12 to potentially win 44. Pot odds = 12/44 = 27.3% required. Our equity ~ 20% (if just flush draw). Not enough. However we also have straight possibilities? Not. So call is negative expected value.\n\nWe could raise to make them fold if they are weak. But they are betting again, maybe they have a strong hand (maybe Ace high, pair, etc). They may have Ace (board has Ace). Could be top pair Ace, etc. Our flush draw is not strong enough to raise.\n\nWe could fold. That preserves chips. Since we are deep stack, folding is reasonable.\n\nConsider tournament: we have 68 BB, comfortable.\n\nThus best action: fold.\n\nWe need to output JSON with action \"fold\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

The description says Position: BB (Seat5). But actions: Seat5 post_sb 2, Seat1 post_bb 4. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. However they say our position BB. Might be a mistake: Actually seat5 is SB, but they said BB. We'll follow given: Our position BB (maybe they treat seat5 as BB). Regardless, we are facing a bet of 2 (to call). The big blind posted 4, we posted 2 as SB, so amount to call is 2 (to complete BB). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total). Hand: A4 offsuit (4h Ac). Stack 270, deep.\n\nWe need decide fold/call/raise. A4 offsuit is weak but can be played from BB vs a single raise? The opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking, who has raised preflop in previous hands (hand numbers 6,11,17,26,30) with amounts 8-14 (so 2-3.5x BB). Likely they are raising with a range of strong hands, maybe some suited connectors, etc. Our A4 offsuit is marginal. In BB, against a raise, typical play is to fold weak offsuit aces like A4o unless you have good implied odds and deep stacks. Stack is 67.5 BB, deep. However tournament stage unknown. Likely we should call to see flop because we have A-high and potential wheel? Actually 4h gives us a straight draw possibilities (A-2-3-4-5) but need 2 and 3. Not great.\n\nWe could also raise to isolate but risk.\n\nGiven opponent's raise pattern (maybe they raise with a wide range?), but we have limited info. Usually A4o is not a raise from BB vs raise. So call is reasonable.\n\nAmount to call 2 is small relative to stack, pot will be 8 after call (4+2+2). So we can call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

In tournament with 32.8 BB, can consider call to see flop if implied odds, but K8 offsuit is marginal vs raise. Opponent DeepSeek-V3.2's raise pattern: we have only one recorded raise preflop of 10 (hand #3). Not much data. Could be a wide raiser.\n\nStack sizes: we have 262, opponent 115. So opponent is short (approx 14 BB). Might be shoving soon. But now they raised to 24 (3 big blinds). Could be trying to steal. K8 offsuit is not great for a call against a raise from early position. However we are in BB, we have already 8 invested; calling 20 adds to pot. Pot after call would be 36+20+20? Actually current pot 36 includes sb 4 + bb 8 + raise 24? That is 4+8+24 = 36. If we call 20, total pot becomes 36+20 = 56. Pot odds: need to call 20 to win 56, so 26% needed. K8 offsuit vs unknown range maybe ~20% equity. So call maybe borderline.\n\nGiven tournament, preserving stack is important. Might fold.\n\nBut we could also raise to isolate short stack. Minimum raise to 40, raising to 40 would be 20 more than call? Actually raise to 40 total, meaning we add 40-24 = 16 more than call?

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #46, preflop. Our hand Tc9d (ten of clubs, nine of diamonds). Position CO (cutoff). Stack 274 chips, 34.2 BB. Blinds 4/8, pot 28 (includes blinds). Actions: SB (seat2) posted 4, BB (seat3) posted 8, seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 16 (so raise 8 over BB). So we face 16 to call.\n\nWe need decide fold/call/raise. Hand: T9 unsuited (clubs and diamonds). In cutoff, with 34 BB, facing a raise of 2 BB (16 total). T9o is a marginal hand. Consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 has raised previously small amounts (4,4,4,12). So seems to be making small raises, maybe wide range? Could be a standard open raise. He raised to 16 (2BB). That's a standard open raise size. His range could be broad, but still includes many strong hands.\n\nOur hand T9o has some potential for straight draws, but not premium. In a tournament, with 34 BB, we could call to see flop, but also risk being dominated. Position is good (CO). We could also consider 3-betting? But raise to at least 24 (minimum raise). That's 3BB total? Actually raise to 24 means additional 8 over call? Minimum raise is 24 (so raise 8 more). That would be 3BB total (24). That's a small 3-bet, could be used as a bluff or to isolate. But given we have a marginal hand, 3-betting might be risky.\n\nWe could also fold and preserve stack.\n\nWe might want to call if we think we can outplay postflop and have implied odds. Stack depth 34 BB, not deep but enough.\n\nWe should also consider other players: Seats 1 and 2 still to act after us (since we are CO, seat5, next is seat1 (UTG?), seat2 (SB). So if we call, we may face more action.\n\nGiven hand strength, I think best is to fold. T9o is not strong enough to call a raise in cutoff with 34 BB, especially against a player who raises standard size. So fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

If we raise, they could re-raise.\n\nGiven our hand is marginal, maybe best to fold? But we have 32 BB, folding a marginal hand is fine. However 8h7h suited can flop well, but risk of being out of position after flop if they raise. Our stack is decent, we could call and see flop cheap. But given they are aggressive raises historically, they may raise us if we call (they might be defending SB). But they already posted SB (4) and BB (8). SB may raise to steal? Actually SB may raise (they have history of raising 8-32). If we just call 8, we give them chance to raise. If we raise to 16, we might isolate BB and maybe get heads up. But raising with 8h7h is risky.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, we have medium stack, we can preserve chips. Probably best to fold to avoid trouble. However 8h7h suited is a decent hand to try a steal if they are tight. But data shows they raise often, maybe they are loose-aggressive, so they may call or raise. Might be better to fold.\n\nI'll choose fold.\n\n",

So it's just preflop with only blinds, and it's our turn in BB after posting BB? Wait seat5 is BB, posted 16. Actually seat5 is BB, posted 16 (big blind). Seat1 posted small blind 8. So we are BB and have already posted 16, and no raise. Amount to call is 8? That seems odd: amount to call is 8 (the small blind). Since we are BB, we can check (call 0) because the big blind is already posted. So legal actions: fold, call, raise. \"call\" would mean just checking (matching the small blind? Actually call amount is 8, meaning to call the small blind to complete the bet? In many implementations, after blinds, the BB can check. So we can check (call) for 0 chips. The hand: 4s Qd is a weak hand, but in BB with 14.6 BB, we can just check and see flop. So we choose \"check\" i.e., call with 0. The action \"call\" is used to call the amount to call (8) but we can also \"check\" if amount to call is 0. But amount to call is 8, meaning we need to put 8 more to call? Actually we are BB, so the amount to call is the small blind 8. To stay in, we need to put 8 more, making our total contribution 24 (8 SB + 16 BB). That's a raise? No, it's just a call of the small blind. Usually BB can check, not call the small blind. But the system says amount to call 8, so we need to call 8 to continue. So we could call (i.e., put 8 more) making our effective bet 24. That seems like a decent spot to call with Q4 offsuit? Probably we should just call (i.e., check) because it's a standard BB call. However, we can also raise to 32 min raise, which would be 32 total (i.e., raise 16 more). With 4Q offsuit, not a good raise. So we call.\n\nThus action: \"call\", raise_to null. Reasoning: weak hand, just call to see flop.\n\n"

We have Qd, so pair of queens, kicker 4, board also has K. Opponent seat1 (Kimi-K2) is in BB? Actually seat1 is BB with 151 chips. Seat5 is us (BB? Actually we are BB seat5, but seat1 is BB? Wait blinds: seat5 posted sb 8, seat1 posted bb 16. So seat1 is BB, seat5 is SB. So we are SB. Preflop we called 8, seat1 checked. So on flop, seat1 is acting first (since BB). The pot is 32. Action: amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. So we can check or raise. We need to decide.\n\nOur hand: top pair Q, but opponent may have K, A, Q, etc. Board is somewhat coordinated: a straight draw? 2-? Actually need 3-4-5 for straight, but we have 4. So we have gutshot straight draw (needs 3 or 5). Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Board has two diamonds (Qc, Kd, 2d). We have 4s, not diamond. So no flush draw.\n\nWe have ~14 BB stack, 226 chips. Opponent has 151 chips. So opponent is shorter stack. We have more chips, but still shortish.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, Kimi-K2 (seat1) has many folds preflop, occasional raises. On flop, only one recorded bet: hand 24, flop bet 30 (unknown board). So they sometimes bet on flop.\n\nGiven we have top pair but vulnerable to Kx, A, maybe also Qx with better kicker. Our kicker is weak. Might consider check-call if they bet? But we have no bet to call now; we can check or raise. Since we have top pair, we could try to protect by raising to extract value from worse hands (like K, J, 10, etc) or from draws. However we are out of position (SB vs BB? Actually after flop, action order: BB acts first, then SB. So we are out of position (SB). Raising out of position can be good to get value, but also can be risky if opponent has strong hand and raises again.\n\nOpponent stack is 151, pot 32, so they could shove all-in if they have strong hand. Minimum raise is 16 (to 16 total? Actually raise to 16 total? The pot is 32, min raise to 48? Wait: In NL Hold'em, min raise is amount of previous bet plus that amount. Since there is no bet, min raise is big blind amount (16). So raise to 16 total? Actually we have already contributed 8 (SB) and 16 (BB) preflop, pot 32 includes both. So min raise to 48? But they said minimum raise to: 16. That seems like raise amount relative to 0? Probably raise to 16 chips total added to pot? Might be ambiguous. But we just need to output raise_to number.\n\nWe can raise to e.g., 48 chips (i.e., 16 more). But we have to follow format.\n\nGiven opponent short stack, we might want to protect and maybe isolate. If we raise to about 80-100 chips, we can put pressure. But we must consider we have only 226 chips, opponent 151. If we raise to 100, opponent can call or shove. If they have a better hand (Kx, AQ, etc) they may call. If they have a draw, they may call hoping to hit.\n\nI think best is to raise to about 80 chips (approx 2.5x pot) to get value from worse hands and protect against draws. Since we are out of position, raising is good.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 80 (or maybe 96). Let's choose 80.\n\nReasoning: top pair, decent hand, opponent short stack, want value, protect.\n\n",

That would be 128 total (since we already have 16 in). Actually raise_to 144 total, so additional 128. That would be about 9 BB, still less than opponent's stack?

Also we have backdoor flush? We have Qd, board suits: Tc (clubs), 7s, 9h. No flush draw.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 (Seat4) checked. They are the original caller preflop (called 72 after raise by DeepSeek). So they have a hand likely middle pair or maybe overcards. Stack sizes: we have 178, pot 240. Opponent stack? Not given but they have 199 chips originally, they have called 72 preflop, still have about 127 left. They checked now. We are in the big blind (out of position). Decision: Check or raise.\n\nOur hand: top pair Q kicker. That's decent but board is fairly coordinated (straight draw). Opponent could have 8-8? Actually 8 is not on board, they could have 8-8 for set? No set of tens? Could have T? They could have T8 for two pair? Actually board has T,7,9. If they have 8-8 they have pair of eights, not great. If they have J8 they'd have open-ended straight draw (J8 gives 8-9-10-J). But they checked, maybe they have weak.\n\nGiven we are short stack (11 BB) but still decent. Raising could protect against draws. Minimum raise is 64 (to 64 total? Actually raise_to = total amount). Currently amount to call is 0, so raising to 64 means we bet 64 chips. That would be about 0.27 of our stack. Pot 240, bet 64 makes pot 304, gives us odds. Opponent might call with draws.\n\nCheck could give free card but risk opponent check-raises later. Considering we are out of position, maybe bet for value and protect.\n\nOpponent's preflop behavior: they called raise, not aggressive. Might be a passive player, likely to call a bet with weak draws. So bet.\n\nThus action: raise to 64 (i.e., bet 64). Reasoning.\n\n",

Our stack 114, after calling would have 50 left. Pot currently 491, plus opponent bet 64 (makes pot 555), plus our call 64 would be 619 total pot. We would have 50 chips left, about 0.41 BB left?

Actually they raised 80 from presumably 80 stack? Not sure. But they are out of tournament, but still playing maybe all-in. They called flop bet. So they likely have a strong hand like Aces, Kings, etc. But they are all-in, cannot bet further. The turn bet is from seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) with 71 chips left. They bet 64, which is almost their stack. They might be bluffing or have strong hand. Our hand is marginal.\n\nWe should consider tournament: we have short stack 7.1 BB. Need to double up. Opponent has 71 chips (~4.4 BB). If we call and lose, we go down to 50 chips left, still alive but short. If we fold, we keep 114 chips, but may be stuck behind bigger stacks?

Opponent in BB (seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 127 chips. Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) is in UTG? Actually seat4 called 16 (so presumably UTG? Actually seat order: seat5 SB, seat1 BB, seat2 is after BB? Not sure but seat4 is maybe under the gun? Anyway seat4 called 16, so we have 3 players: SB (us), BB (Kimi), and seat4 (MiniMax) who called the BB.\n\nWe are in SB, facing a call from BB and a call from seat4. Actually action order: SB posts 8, BB posts 16, seat2 folds, seat4 calls 16, now it's our turn (SB) after the blinds? Usually preflop order: after blinds, action starts with UTG (first active left of BB). But here seat4 called, then SB acts last preflop. So we have to decide.\n\nWe have A\u2663? Actually Ad Js (Ace diamonds and Jack spades). In SB with 6.6 BB, short stack. Need to consider push/fold strategy. With 6.6 BB, typical push/fold range includes AJs? Yes AJs is a strong hand for push. The pot is 40, call amount 8 (to match BB). If we call, we would be putting 8 more, making pot 48 and we have 98 left. But raising to 32 (minimum raise) would be a raise of 24 more, total 32 from SB (including 8 already posted? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in, so raise to 32 means we add 24 more). That would be a raise of 2 BB (since big blind is 16). With 6.6 BB, raising to 32 is about 2 BB raise.\n\nGiven short stack, typical optimal is either go all-in (push) or fold, rarely call a raise. But here it's a call scenario: we could call 8 to see flop, but with 6.6 BB it's risky to see flop out of position. Better to push all-in? But legal actions: fold, call, raise. Raise to 32 is allowed, but that's not all-in; all-in would be 106. But raise_to can be any amount up to stack? Minimum raise 32. Could raise to all-in (106). That would be a shove.\n\nGiven we have AJs, a strong hand, and short stack, best is to shove all-in to maximize fold equity. Opponents have bigger stacks (127 and 402). They may call with wide ranges. So push.\n\nThus action: raise to 106 (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, strong hand, maximize equity.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed. So we raise to 106.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: BB with Ad Js. Board: 7h Jd As. So we have top two pair (Aces and Jacks) with Ace kicker (actually we have A J, board A J 7, so we have two pair, Aces and Jacks, plus a 7 kicker). That's a very strong hand. Opponent is MiniMax-M2, with 312 chips. Our stack is 8 chips, which is 0.5 BB (tiny). The pot is 228 chips. We're in BB with 8 chips left, effectively short-stacked. The opponent has called our preflop raise? Let's see preflop: seat5 raise 106 (to 106?), seat4 call 90 (so they called 90). So preflop pot: small blind 8, big blind 16, seat4 call 90, seat5 raise 106 (so seat5 put 106 total?), seat4 call 90 (so they matched to 106? Actually raise to 106, so seat4 needed to call extra 90 (since they had already 16). So total contributions: seat5 106, seat4 106 (16 + 90), plus blinds 8+16 = 30? Wait small blind 8 (seat5 posted), big blind 16 (seat1 posted). Seat5 raise 106 (so adds 98 more?). Actually after posting SB 8, they raise to 106 total (i.e., they put 106 total). So they added 98 more. Seat1 posted BB 16 then folded preflop. Seat4 called 16 then called 90 to match 106. So pot after preflop: seat5 106, seat4 106, seat1 16, seat5's SB 8 counted already? Actually seat5's 106 includes the 8 SB? Probably yes: raise to 106 means total bet is 106, includes SB. So seat5 contributed 106, seat4 contributed 106, seat1 contributed 16, total pot = 228 (as given). Good.\n\nNow flop: board gives us two pair. Opponent's stack is huge relative to us. We have 8 chips left (including our 8 chips currently). Actually after preflop, we have 8 chips left (our stack). Wait we had 8 chips total at start? The stack line says \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\". So we are extremely short. We are essentially all-in already? But we posted 8 SB then raised to 106, meaning we must have had at least 106 chips. But the stack says 8 chips? Something inconsistent. Perhaps the stack shown is after posting SB? Actually typical: Stack is remaining after posting SB? In many poker logs, stack shows after posting blinds. So we posted SB 8, leaving 8 chips? That would be 16 total? Hmm.\n\nGiven the numbers: blinds are 8/16, pot is 228, we have 8 chips left (0.5 BB). That suggests we are indeed short stacked; we cannot bet more. The legal actions: fold, check. So we cannot raise. We can check (i.e., we are all-in already). So we just check. Reason: we have best hand likely, but cannot bet. So check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: BB (seat5) with Ad Js. Board: 7h Jd As 7s. So we have two pair: Aces and Jacks? Actually we have Ad Js, board has As and Jd, so we have trips? Let's see: board: 7h Jd As 7s. So there is As (ace of spades) and Jd (jack diamonds). Our hand: Ad (ace diamonds) and Js (jack spades). So we have two pair: Aces (pair) and Jacks (pair). Actually we have Aces: As on board + Ad in hand = pair of Aces. Jacks: Jd on board + Js in hand = pair of Jacks. So we have two pair, Aces and Jacks. Board also has paired 7s (two 7s). So board is a full house? Wait board: 7h, Jd, As, 7s. That's two 7s, one J, one A. Not a full house. Our hand makes two pair. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) presumably has some hand. He called preflop raise, then checked flop. Now on turn, we need to act. The pot is 228, we have 8 chips total (0.5 BB). Actually our stack is 8 chips, we posted SB 8, posted BB 16? Wait we are BB seat5, posted 16. Preflop we raised to 106 (so we put 106 total? Actually raise to 106 means total bet 106, so we added 90 more after posting 16). So we have now contributed 106. Opponent called 90 more, so he also has 106 total. So pot after preflop is 212? Actually initial pot: blinds 8+16=24. Then raise to 106, call 90, so total pot = 24 + 106 + 90? Wait raise to 106 includes his 16? Let's compute: BB posted 16, SB posted 8. Then raise to 106 means BB puts 106 total, so adds 90. Then opponent calls 90 (since he posted 16 initially as big blind? Actually seat4 is not blind, he called 16 preflop (call big blind). So he put 16 initially, then call 90 to match raise. So his total contribution = 106. So total pot after preflop = 8+16+106+106 = 236? Wait 8+16=24, plus 106+106=212, total 236. But the hand info says pot: 228 chips. Slight discrepancy maybe due to rounding. Anyway.\n\nNow on turn, board adds 7s making paired board. Our stack is 8 chips left (0.5 BB). Actually we have 8 chips total stack after posting SB? Wait we posted SB 8 preflop, then raise to 106, that uses 106 total, but we only have 8 chips total stack? Something off. The description: \"Your Stack: 8 chips (0.5 BB)\" suggests we are short-stacked: we have only 8 chips total (including posted blind). The blinds are 8/16, so we have 0.5 BB (i.e., 8 chips). So we posted SB 8, then we are BB? Wait position says BB, seat5, but we posted SB 8 and BB 16? That seems contradictory. Possibly seat5 is BB, posted BB 16, but they also show preflop: Seat5 post_sb 8. So seat5 posted SB and also BB? Something weird. Maybe seat5 is small blind (SB) but they label position BB incorrectly. Regardless, we have only 8 chips total, which is the SB amount. So we cannot raise; only check or fold (or call if bet). The legal actions: fold, check. Amount to call: 0. So we can check.\n\nGiven we have a strong hand (two pair top), but we are short stacked and cannot bet. Checking is fine. Could we go all-in? No, we have no chips left to bet (we have 8 chips but we already invested? Actually we have 8 total, but we have already invested 106? That cannot be. Something inconsistent. Likely the stack is after posting blinds, we have 8 chips left to act, meaning we are effectively all-in already? Actually if we have 8 chips left, we cannot raise. So checking is the only option.\n\nThus action: check. Reasoning: short stack, cannot raise, hand is strong but cannot bet, checking to see showdown.\n\nReturn JSON.",

So we have a full house? Let's see: board has As (Ace of spades) and Js (Jack of diamonds). Our hand gives us another Ace (Ad) and another Jack (Js). So we have Aces full of Jacks? Actually we have three Aces (As, Ad, plus we have? Wait board has As only one Ace. Our hand has Ad, so two Aces. Not three. Board also has Js, we have Js, so two Jacks. So we have two pair: Aces and Jacks, plus board also has pair of 7s. So we have two pair Aces and Jacks with a kicker? Actually we have Aces and Jacks, board also has pair of 7s, making a full house? To have full house you need three of a kind plus a pair. We have two Aces, two Jacks, and two 7s on board. That's two pair plus extra? But we have 5 cards: As, 7h, Jd, 7s, plus our Ad, Js. That's 6 cards but we pick best 5: we can choose As, Ad, Js, Jd, plus a 7? Actually best five: As, Ad (two Aces), Js, Jd (two Jacks), and 7h (or 7s) as kicker. That's two pair Aces and Jacks with a 7 kicker. Not a full house. So we have two pair.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 90 into pot 318 on turn. Our stack 8 chips total, we have 8 chips left (including our 8? Actually stack is 8 chips total, we posted 8 sb, then we raised preflop to 106 (so we invested 106). Wait we posted sb 8, then raise 106 (meaning we added 98? Actually raise from 8 to 106 total? The raise amount is 106 total put in? Usually raise to 106 means total contributed after raise is 106. So we have contributed 106 (including sb). Then opponent called 90 more? Actually seat4 call 90 after raise to 106, meaning they put total 106 as well. So pot after preflop: 106*2 + blinds? The blinds 8+16 =24. So pot ~236? But given pot 318 after flop? Anyway now turn bet 90, we have only 8 chips left total? Actually stack is 8 chips after all prior betting, meaning we are short stacked. So we are essentially all-in if we call. The bet is 90, we cannot call fully because we have only 8 chips. So we can go all-in for 8? But legal actions: fold, call. So call means call all-in (8). So we must decide fold or call.\n\nOur hand: two pair Aces and Jacks. Opponent's range: He called preflop raise, so likely strong hand, maybe Aces, Kings, Queens, maybe pocket pairs, maybe draws. On flop board: 7h Jd As. Turn card is 7s, giving board paired 7s. Opponent bets 90. Could be value bet with two pair, trips, full house, or a draw. He could also be bluffing? With short stack, but he has 222 chips, not short.\n\nOur stack is 8 chips, we are almost eliminated. Need to survive. Call all-in with two pair may be okay if opponent could have better (full house, trips). Let's evaluate opponent's possible hands: Preflop he called our raise from BB (we raised to 106). He is in seat4, likely in middle position? He called 16 then called 90 preflop. So his range includes broadways, pairs, suited connectors. On flop with board Jd As 7h, he checked. We checked. Turn 7s gives board two pair. He bets. Could be he has a set of 7s? But he didn't have a 7 in hand because board didn't have 7 before turn. He could have 7x pocket, now has set. Could have pocket 7s (77) gives set. Could have A7, J7, etc giving trips? Actually with 7 on turn, any hand with a 7 now has a pair of 7s plus board had one 7 before, now two 7s. So a hand like A7 would have two pair (Aces and 7s) but we have Aces and Jacks"

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand: Ad Js, board: 7h Jd As 7s. So we have two pair: Aces and Jacks? Actually board: 7h Jd As 7s. Our hand adds Ad (Ace of diamonds) and Js (Jack of spades). So we have a full house? Let's see: board has As (Ace of spades) and Js (Jack of diamonds). Our hand gives us another Ace (Ad) and another Jack (Js). So we have Aces full of Jacks? Actually we have three Aces (As, Ad, plus we have? Wait board has As only one Ace. Our hand has Ad, so two Aces. Not three. Board also has Js, we have Js, so two Jacks. So we have two pair: Aces and Jacks, plus board also has pair of 7s. So we have two pair Aces and Jacks with a kicker? Actually we have Aces and Jacks, board also has pair of 7s, making a full house? To have full house you need three of a kind plus a pair. We have two Aces, two Jacks, and two 7s on board. That's two pair plus extra? But we have 5 cards: As, 7h, Jd, 7s, plus our Ad, Js. That's 6 cards but we pick best 5: we can choose As, Ad, Js, Jd, plus a 7? Actually best five: As, Ad (two Aces), Js, Jd (two Jacks), and 7h (or 7s) as kicker. That's two pair Aces and Jacks with a 7 kicker. Not a full house. So we have two pair.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 90 into pot 318 on turn. Our stack 8 chips total, we have 8 chips left (including our 8? Actually stack is 8 chips total, we posted 8 sb, then we raised preflop to 106 (so we invested 106). Wait we posted sb 8, then raise 106 (meaning we added 98? Actually raise from 8 to 106 total? The raise amount is 106 total put in? Usually raise to 106 means total contributed after raise is 106. So we have contributed 106 (including sb). Then opponent called 90 more? Actually seat4 call 90 after raise to 106, meaning they put total 106 as well. So pot after preflop: 106*2 + blinds? The blinds 8+16 =24. So pot ~236? But given pot 318 after flop? Anyway now turn bet 90, we have only 8 chips left total? Actually stack is 8 chips after all prior betting, meaning we are short stacked. So we are essentially all-in if we call. The bet is 90, we cannot call fully because we have only 8 chips. So we can go all-in for 8? But legal actions: fold, call. So call means call all-in (8). So we must decide fold or call.\n\nOur hand: two pair Aces and Jacks. Opponent's range: He called preflop raise, so likely strong hand, maybe Aces, Kings, Queens, maybe pocket pairs, maybe draws. On flop board: 7h Jd As. Turn card is 7s, giving board paired 7s. Opponent bets 90. Could be value bet with two pair, trips, full house, or a draw. He could also be bluffing? With short stack, but he has 222 chips, not short.\n\nOur stack is 8 chips, we are almost eliminated. Need to survive. Call all-in with two pair may be okay if opponent could have better (full house, trips). Let's evaluate opponent's possible hands: Preflop he called our raise from BB (we raised to 106). He is in seat4, likely in middle position? He called 16 then called 90 preflop. So his range includes broadways, pairs, suited connectors. On flop with board Jd As 7h, he checked. We checked. Turn 7s gives board two pair. He bets. Could be he has a set of 7s? But he didn't have a 7 in hand because board didn't have 7 before turn. He could have 7x pocket, now has set. Could have pocket 7s (77) gives set. Could have A7, J7, etc giving trips? Actually with 7 on turn, any hand with a 7 now has a pair of 7s plus board had one 7 before, now two 7s. So a hand like A7 would have two pair (Aces and 7s) but we have Aces and Jacks",

Actually AJ gives Aces and Jacks both pairs, not full house). So many combos beat us. But our chance to survive maybe call is okay if opponent is bluffing or has weaker two pair.

Might be okay to limp? Actually it's a raise? The BB posted 16, we posted SB 8, then we need to call 8 to match BB. That's a standard raise from BB? Actually the BB is a raise of 16 (post). So we can call 8 to see flop. 3K is a decent hand? Off-suit K3 is not great, but could be okay to call in SB vs BB with deep stacks? But stack is shallow 12.8 BB. I think folding is reasonable.

          "reasoning_content": "We have Jd6d in BB, opponent (seat2) raised to 48 (from 16 blind). So raise size 48 total, meaning they put 48 chips total (they are in SB? Actually seat1 posted SB 8, seat5 posted BB 16. Seat2 is UTG? Not important). They raised to 48, so they added 32 chips (since big blind 16). So raise is relatively small, about 3x big blind. Our stack is 180, 11.2 BB, short stack. J6 suited is a speculative hand, not great for a raise. In BB, facing a raise of 48, call would be 40 to see flop. Pot after call would be 72 + 40 =112? Actually pot currently 72 (SB+BB+raise). If we call, pot becomes 112. Our stack after call would be 140. Is J6d a hand we want to call? In short stack, we might consider either shove all-in or fold. Raising to 80 would be min raise (increase total to 80). That would be 64 more chips, total stack 180-64=116 left. That's not an all-in. With J6 suited, not a good raise. Better to fold or call? With 11 BB, often you push or fold, but you can also call to see flop if implied odds good. J6 suited can flop a straight draw or flush, but limited.\n\nOpponent's raise size 48 is relatively small, perhaps they are trying to steal. Their raise history: they have raised amounts 12,16,24,157,40. So they vary; recent raise 40 (hand 72) similar to this. No clear pattern.\n\nGiven we have 11 BB, maybe we should go all-in? But our hand is weak. All-in could be risky, but short stack may need to pick spots. J6 suited is not a typical all-in candidate; better to fold.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\n",

So likely they are passive and will call a raise. We could raise to isolate and maybe get heads-up with one opponent. But we have 3 players; raising may cause both to call, increasing pot. With QTs suited, we have decent equity.\n\nGiven we are short stacked (11 BB), we want to preserve chips but also accumulate. Raising to 32 (i.e., 2x BB) is standard.

Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace is straight, we have Ten and Queen, board provides King Ace, need Jack. That's one card needed, but also need? The straight would be Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace, we have Ten and Queen, need Jack, plus need? That's only one missing card, but we need 5 cards: we have T, Q, K, A, need J. So it's a gutshot (one card) not open-ended. Also we have backdoor flush draw: hearts: we have Qh, board has 5h, need two more hearts. So potential.\n\nOur hand currently: Qh Ts, board Kd 5h Ad. No pair, no made hand. We have gutshot straight draw (J) and backdoor flush.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 56 into pot 144. That's about 0.39 pot. Small bet, maybe a continuation bet or a probe. He has 216 chips, big stack relative to us (148). He could be betting with a wide range: any Ace, K, maybe draws, etc.\n\nOur stack: 148, we have 56 to call, raise min 112 (so raise to 112 total). Our effective stack is 148, we could raise to 112 (leaving us 36 behind). Could also go all-in 148.\n\nWe need to consider tournament context: we have 9.2 BB, short stack. We need to pick up chips, but also preserve. We're BTN, we raised preflop to 32 (2x BB) from 148, so we were raising. Opponent called. So opponent likely has a range of hands that call a 2x raise from BTN: could be broadway, pairs, suited connectors, etc.\n\nNow flop is K A 5. Our raise preflop with Q T is a bit speculative but okay.\n\nNow opponent bets small. Options: call, raise (maybe all-in), fold. Considering we are short stack, maybe we could shove all-in? But raise to 112 is still less than all-in. However, a raise to 112 might be seen as a semi-bluff, but we have a gutshot and backdoor flush; not strong enough to commit.\n\nOur equity vs opponent's range? Opponent likely has many combos that beat us: Aces (A?), K, maybe also draws. Our chance to improve on turn or river is limited: need J for straight (4 outs) plus maybe hearts for flush (2 more outs after turn). So about 6 outs total, ~12% per street. Not great.\n\nGiven we have 9 BB, we could consider a shove to try to double up. But we have only 148 chips, and opponent has 216, so we would be short-stack vs bigger stack. If we shove all-in (148) we risk losing our stack. But we need chips to survive.\n\nHowever, the bet is only 56, pot 144. If we call, we will have about 92 chips left (148-56). That leaves us with 5.75 BB, dangerously short. If we raise to 112 (i.e., add 56 more), we commit 112 total, leaving us 36 chips (2.25 BB). That's even worse.\n\nIf we fold, we preserve 148 but lose the chance to double up. But folding 56 into 144 when we have 9 BB may be okay if we think we are behind.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should go all-in to maximize fold equity. Our hand is not strong, but the opponent's small bet might be a probe; they may fold many weaker hands to an all-in. However, they have a big stack; they may call with many combos.\n\nBut we have Qh Ts, which has some showdown value if we hit straight or flush. But still low.\n\nI think best is to call, preserve chips? Actually calling leaves us with 92 chips, still short but we can try to see next card. If we call and miss, we may be forced to go all-in later.\n\nGiven we have only 6 outs, maybe better to fold and preserve stack for better spot. But folding 56 when we have 148 and 9 BB? That's 56/148 = 38% of stack. That's a big portion.\n\nConsidering tournament: short stack needs to find a spot to double up. Might be okay"

          "reasoning_content": "We need to output JSON with action, raise_to null if not raise, and reasoning. Determine best action.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe go all-in (raise to 148). But raise_to must be total amount we put in, not additional. We have 148 total stack, but we already have 32 preflop committed? Actually our stack after preflop raise 32: we put 32 into pot, leaving 148-32=116 chips left? Wait initial stack 148 includes the raise? Usually stack shown is total chips before action? It says \"Your Stack: 148 chips (9.2 BB)\". That's current stack before flop action? After preflop raise of 32, our stack would be 148 - 32 = 116. But the representation may be after preflop? Usually stack shown is current stack after preflop? Not sure. But pot is 144 includes our raise. So likely our stack is 148 after preflop? Actually pot: blinds 8+16=24, plus our raise 32 (so we added 16 extra?), opponent called 16, so pot after preflop: 8+16+16+32 = 72? Wait compute: SB 8, BB 16, MiniMax called 16, we raised to 32, then they called 16 more? Actually raise to 32 means we put 32, they call 16 additional (since they already put 16 blind). So total contributions: SB 8, BB 16, MiniMax 16 (call) + 16 (call to raise) = 32, we 32. So total pot = 8+16+32+32 = 88. But pot shown is 144 after flop bet of 56. So preflop pot was 144-56 = 88, matches. So our stack after preflop is 148 - 32 = 116. So we have 116 remaining. The amount to call is 56, which would leave us with 60 chips after call. So we can raise to 112 (i.e., total contribution of 112 from us). Since we already have 32 in, raising to 112 means we add 80 more, total contribution 112, leaving 148-112 = 36. So we could also go all-in: raise to 148 (i.e., all-in). But legal actions list only fold, call, raise. Raise to 112 is min raise, but we could raise more up to all-in? Usually allowed. So we could raise to 148.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should go all-in to maximize fold equity. Reason: we are short, need to double up, we have some outs and backdoor flush, and opponent's bet is small, could fold many hands.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 148.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So no raises yet, it's just blinds. Amount to call 16 (big blind). Minimum raise to 32. So we can call 16 (i.e., just complete the big blind) or raise. We are UTG (early position) with AKo. In a tournament with 18 BB, we are shortish. AKo is a strong hand, but raising is typical. Need to consider opponent tendencies: Seat2 (Kimi-K2) is the SB, but they haven't acted yet? Actually SB already posted, but they are next after us? UTG is seat5, order: seat5 (us), then seat6? Actually seat numbers: seat1,2,3,4,5 (us). So after UTG, next seat is seat6? Not listed. Probably seat1 is next after seat5? Actually typical order: seats 1-8 clockwise. If we are seat5, next is seat6 (not listed), then seat7, seat8, seat1, seat2 (SB), seat3 (folded), seat4 (BB). But anyway, we just need to decide raise or call. With 18 BB, we could consider a raise to 3x BB (48) to build pot and maybe isolate. Opponents: Kimi-K2 (seat2) appears to raise various amounts preflop, sometimes small (12, 16, 24) but also big (157). They are maybe aggressive. MiniMax-M2 (seat4) is BB with 200 chips. Unknown tendencies.\n\nGiven our stack is shortish, we want to avoid being blinded out. AKo is a premium hand, we should raise. Minimum raise to 32 (2x BB). Typically raise 3x BB = 48. That would be raise_to 48. That is legal (>= minimum). Our stack can cover.\n\nThus decision: raise to 48. Reasoning: strong hand, early position, need to build pot, isolate, avoid being stuck with big blind, etc.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Actually seat5 is BB (our seat). Seat1 posted SB 16. So seat1 is SB with 87 chips, seat5 is BB. So we are in BB vs SB only (others folded). SB posted 16, we posted 32. Amount to call is 16 (to match SB's 16? Actually we already posted BB 32, SB 16, so pot 48. To call we need to match SB's 16? But we already have 32 posted; the amount to call is 16 to raise? Actually in heads-up, after blinds, SB acts first preflop. So SB can raise or call. He posted 16, we posted 32, so we are out of position (BB). The amount to call is 16 (i.e., SB's bet). So SB hasn't acted yet; it's our turn? Wait order: SB acts first preflop, then BB. Since SB posted SB, BB posted BB, now action is on SB first. But the hand description shows \"preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 16\" (that's SB?), \"Seat 1 post_bb 32\". Actually seat5 is SB (post_sb) 16, seat1 post_bb 32. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But our position is BB (Seat5). Wait confusion: It says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". But then actions show seat5 post_sb 16. That contradicts. Possibly they swapped; seat numbers are off. Anyway, we are BB with 7d8d. The amount to call is 16, meaning someone raised to 48? Actually minimum raise to 64. So current bet is 16 (SB's bet?), we need to call 16 to match? Actually we are out of position after SB posted 16, BB posted 32 (forced). So the bet to call is 0? In heads-up, after blinds, SB can raise, else check (which is a call of BB's 32?). Usually SB can either raise or check (which is a call of BB's blind). If SB checks, the action goes to BB, who can check or raise. But the amount to call being 16 suggests SB raised to 48? Let's parse: Starting pot: SB 16, BB 32 = 48. If SB raises, they'd add at least double the BB? Minimum raise is to 64 total (i.e., raise by 32). So SB could raise to 64 total (i.e., add 48 more). Then amount to call would be 48? Not 16. So maybe the description is that SB posted 16, BB posted 32, now it's SB's turn; they have the option to raise to at least 64 total, which would be raise of 48. The amount to call for BB would be 48 if SB raised. But they say amount to call: 16. That suggests SB has not acted yet; the amount to call for SB is 16 (i.e., to call BB's 32? No, SB would need to call 16 to match BB's 32). Yes, SB needs to call 16 to match BB's 32. So it's SB's turn. But the legal actions are for us? The prompt says we need to decide action now. So likely it's our turn after SB posted SB and BB posted BB, and then SB folded? No, SB hasn't acted. However they list actions: seat5 post_sb 16, seat1 post_bb 32, seat2 fold, seat4 fold. No further actions. So now it's SB's turn (seat5) to act. But we are seat5? Wait they said seat5 is us. So seat5 posted SB 16. So we are SB. But they said our position BB (Seat5). This is contradictory. Could be a mistake. Let's assume we are BB (seat5) with 7d8d, and SB (seat1) posted 16 and folded? Actually seat1 posted BB 32, so seat1 is BB. So we are SB. But they said our position BB. Hmm.\n\nGiven the amount to call is 16, that matches SB needing to call BB's blind. So we are SB, need to decide call, raise, or fold. Our hand 7d8d is decent suited connector, short stack 8.9 BB, opponent seat1 has 87 chips (short stack 2.7 BB). If we raise, we could isolate. Since opponent short stack, they may go all-in. Raising to 64 would"

Actually seat5 is BB (our seat). Seat1 posted SB 16. So seat1 is SB with 87 chips, seat5 is BB. So we are in BB vs SB only (others folded). SB posted 16, we posted 32. Amount to call is 16 (to match SB's 16? Actually we already posted BB 32, SB 16, so pot 48. To call we need to match SB's 16? But we already have 32 posted; the amount to call is 16 to raise? Actually in heads-up, after blinds, SB acts first preflop. So SB can raise or call. He posted 16, we posted 32, so we are out of position (BB). The amount to call is 16 (i.e., SB's bet). So SB hasn't acted yet; it's our turn? Wait order: SB acts first preflop, then BB. Since SB posted SB, BB posted BB, now action is on SB first. But the hand description shows \"preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 16\" (that's SB?), \"Seat 1 post_bb 32\". Actually seat5 is SB (post_sb) 16, seat1 post_bb 32. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But our position is BB (Seat5). Wait confusion: It says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". But then actions show seat5 post_sb 16. That contradicts. Possibly they swapped; seat numbers are off. Anyway, we are BB with 7d8d. The amount to call is 16, meaning someone raised to 48? Actually minimum raise to 64. So current bet is 16 (SB's bet?), we need to call 16 to match? Actually we are out of position after SB posted 16, BB posted 32 (forced). So the bet to call is 0? In heads-up, after blinds, SB can raise, else check (which is a call of BB's 32?). Usually SB can either raise or check (which is a call of BB's blind). If SB checks, the action goes to BB, who can check or raise. But the amount to call being 16 suggests SB raised to 48? Let's parse: Starting pot: SB 16, BB 32 = 48. If SB raises, they'd add at least double the BB? Minimum raise is to 64 total (i.e., raise by 32). So SB could raise to 64 total (i.e., add 48 more). Then amount to call would be 48? Not 16. So maybe the description is that SB posted 16, BB posted 32, now it's SB's turn; they have the option to raise to at least 64 total, which would be raise of 48. The amount to call for BB would be 48 if SB raised. But they say amount to call: 16. That suggests SB has not acted yet; the amount to call for SB is 16 (i.e., to call BB's 32? No, SB would need to call 16 to match BB's 32). Yes, SB needs to call 16 to match BB's 32. So it's SB's turn. But the legal actions are for us? The prompt says we need to decide action now. So likely it's our turn after SB posted SB and BB posted BB, and then SB folded? No, SB hasn't acted. However they list actions: seat5 post_sb 16, seat1 post_bb 32, seat2 fold, seat4 fold. No further actions. So now it's SB's turn (seat5) to act. But we are seat5? Wait they said seat5 is us. So seat5 posted SB 16. So we are SB. But they said our position BB (Seat5). This is contradictory. Could be a mistake. Let's assume we are BB (seat5) with 7d8d, and SB (seat1) posted 16 and folded? Actually seat1 posted BB 32, so seat1 is BB. So we are SB. But they said our position BB. Hmm.\n\nGiven the amount to call is 16, that matches SB needing to call BB's blind. So we are SB, need to decide call, raise, or fold. Our hand 7d8d is decent suited connector, short stack 8.9 BB, opponent seat1 has 87 chips (short stack 2.7 BB). If we raise, we could isolate. Since opponent short stack, they may go all-in. Raising to 64 would",

Small blind posted 16, big blind posted 32, then we called 16 to complete BB, so we are in BB with 7d8d. Opponent seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 87 (so after posting 32 BB, they raise 55 more? Actually raise to 87 total, amount to call is 55). So we face a raise to 87, pot currently 119 (blinds+call). Our stack 268, min raise to 142 (i.e., raise at least to 142 total). Need decide fold/call/raise.\n\nWe have suited connectors 7-8 suited. In early tournament, short stack ~8 BB. Opponent's raise size: 87 from BB 32, so raise is 55 more, which is about 2.7 BB (since BB=32). That's a standard raise. Our stack 268, we can call 55, leaving us with 213 chips (~6.6 BB). Could also consider 3-bet. But with 7d8d, suited connectors have decent equity vs wide range, but we are short stack; 3-bet would be a large portion of stack. Minimum raise to 142 means raising to 142 total (i.e., additional 55). That would be a raise of 55? Wait: amount to call 55, min raise to 142 means we must increase total bet to at least 142 (i.e., raise by at least 55 more). So raise to 142 would be an additional 55 on top of call? Actually call 55 makes total 87, raise to 142 means we add 55 more, making total bet 142, so raise amount = 55. That's a 2.5x raise relative to original raise? The raise size would be 55, making pot larger.\n\nOur stack 268, raising to 142 would cost 142 chips, leaving 126. That's about 4 BB left. That's a big commitment. 7d8d suited is decent for 3-bet in short stack? Usually you might 3-bet with suited connectors if you think you have fold equity and can play post-flop. But with only 8 BB, a 3-bet that leaves you ~4 BB is risky. Could also go all-in (268) but that's huge.\n\nBetter perhaps to call and see flop, because 7d8d suited can flop draws and have implied odds. However, calling 55 with 8 BB leaves us with 213 chips, still enough to survive. But if we hit flop, we might be short stacked.\n\nOpponent's raise pattern: from recall, they have raised amounts: 16, 32, 24, 143, 119. So sometimes they raise big (143). This raise is 87, moderate. Could be a wide range. With 7d8d, you can call.\n\nThus decision: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand: 7d 8d. Board: Js Ks 3h. So we have gutshot straight draw? Actually J, K, 3. 7-8 gives open-ended? 7-8 with board J K 3: need 9 or 10 for straight? 7-8-9-10-J would be straight, need 9 and 10 both? Actually you have 7-8, board J K 3. To make straight you need 9 and 10? You need 9 and 10 to complete 7-8-9-10-J. That's two cards, not a draw. You have a gutshot for 6-5-4? No. So no straight draw. Flush draw? 7d8d, board has no diamonds, so need two diamonds, not a draw. So we have just high card 8, nothing. Opponent is seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 32 chips left? Actually seat1 has 32 chips. Wait blinds: seat1 is BB with 32 chips left (short stack). He raised preflop to 87 (from 32? Actually he posted 32 blind, then raise to 87 total? He was BB with 32 chips, but his stack is 32 chips total? That seems weird: He posted 32 blind, then raise 87? That would be beyond his stack. But maybe seat1 has 32 chips left after posting? Actually seat1 had 32 chips total, posted 32 blind, so he is all-in preflop. But the actions show seat1 raise 87, which suggests he had more chips. Maybe seat1's stack is 229 chips initially? Wait seat1 is \"Kimi-K2 Thinking - 32 chips\". That's his current chip count after posting? Actually seat1 is BB, his stack is 32 chips after posting? The initial line: Seat1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 32 chips. That likely is his current stack (including blind posted). So he has 32 chips total, posted 32 blind, so he is all-in. Then raise 87? That cannot be. Possibly the numbers are off; maybe seat1's stack is 229 chips, seat2 is 0? Actually seat2 is Kimi-K2 - 229 chips (folded). So seat2 is the one with 229 chips but folded. So seat1 has 32 chips, seat2 229 but folded. So seat1 is short stack and posted 32 blind. Then raise 87? That would be impossible. Maybe the raise amount is total bet size? He posted 32, then raise to 87 means adds 55 more, total 87, which exceeds his stack (32). So maybe seat1 actually has larger stack, but the displayed chips are after posting? This confusion.\n\nNevertheless, we are in BB with 213 chips. Preflop we called 16 (SB) and then called 55 after raise. So pot now 174. After flop, amount to call is 0, we have option to check or raise. Opponent is short stack (maybe 32 chips). He likely is all-in preflop? Actually he raised to 87, we called, so now his remaining stack maybe 32-? Not sure.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, no draws, we should check and likely fold to any bet. But opponent may be short and might bet with any hand. Since we have very short stack? We have 213 chips, 6.7 BB, decent. We can try to steal? Not with weak hand.\n\nThus action: check. Reasoning: weak hand, no draws, check to see if opponent bets, then decide.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. So check.\n\n",

Our hand both diamonds, but need 5 diamonds for flush, not possible. So we have just high card 8. Opponent likely has stronger hand. Pot 174, we have 213 stack, can check or raise. Likely fold if bet, but amount to call is 0, we can check. Should we attempt a bluff? Opponent (Seat 1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 32 chips left? Actually seat1 has 32 chips? Wait seat1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 32 chips. So they are short stacked. They have 32 chips left, we have 213. Pot is 174, they have 32 left, so they are very short. They are likely to be all-in or call any bet? Actually they have 32 chips, but they are not all-in yet. They are short stack, could be shoving. But we are on river, amount to call is 0. If we raise, min raise is 55 which is more than their stack, they'd be all-in for 32 maybe? Actually raise to 55 would be total bet of 55, they'd need to call 55 but they have only 32, they'd be all-in for 32. They could call all-in? Not sure. In many tournaments, you can bet more than opponent's stack, they just call all-in for remaining chips. So raising to 55 would be a bluff attempt to push them all-in for 32 (they would be forced to call). But they have only 32 chips, they'd be all-in anyway if they call. However, they could also fold. Their stack is very short; they might be willing to call any bet if they think they have a decent hand. But we have nothing. Likely they have a strong hand (maybe J K, or a pair). So a bluff may succeed? But they have only 32 chips; they may be desperate to double up. However, they also have limited chips; they may be more likely to call with any decent hand. Our chance of them folding? Maybe they have a marginal hand like a middle pair (3s) but board has two 3s, they could have a full house? Actually board has pair of 3s; they could have a set (3x) or a full house (J or K with 3?). Many combos. So they likely have a strong hand.\n\nGiven we have only high card 8, best is to check. Also we have short stack? Actually we have 213 chips, not short. So checking preserves chips. So action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Short stack, need to pick up chips or survive. Call would be 32 into pot 80, pot odds ~40% (32/(80+32)=0.285). Actually after call, pot 112, you invest 32, equity needed 28.5% to break even. 3T offsuit vs unknown range (SB, BB, and a caller). Likely not enough equity. Raise all-in? Minimum raise to 64, but you could raise all-in 213? Legal raise to at least 64, but you can go all-in if you can't meet min raise? Actually you can raise to any amount up to your stack; min raise is 64. So you could raise to 213 (all-in). That would be a shove of ~6.7 BB. With 3T, not a good shove. Might be a fold.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (Seat1 and 2) have raised various amounts in past, but here they are SB and BB. They posted blinds, not raised preflop. Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called 32 (maybe a loose caller). With short stack, maybe you could steal? But 3T is not a strong stealing hand, but maybe can steal blinds? However there are three players, SB and BB already have money in pot; you would need to raise to isolate. Raising could be a move to steal the BB? But the BB is also a player, and they may call or re-raise. With 3T, you risk being 3-bet.\n\nBetter to fold and preserve stack for better spot.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

That would be a raise of 32 more (since we already have 32 in). That would be 2x BB (32). With a weak hand, maybe not raise. But also we might consider a shove? Minimum raise is 64, not all-in. All-in would be 181. We could raise to 64, but opponent already called small blind and may have a wide range. Raising could isolate and we could have some equity. But Ah4h is not great for 2-bet.\n\nCheck: we see flop cheap. Since we are short stack, we might want to see flop and then decide. But we risk being out of position later (we'll be out of position vs opponent on later streets). However we have the option to check and then possibly call a bet if flop favorable.\n\nGiven we have 5.7 BB, typical strategy is to push or fold unless we have decent hand.

Usually stack includes blind. So they have 80 chips total (including sb posted). They bet 96? That can't be. Possibly a mistake: maybe they have 180 chips but displayed incorrectly. But assume they have enough to bet 96. Anyway we need decide fold or call. With such weak hand, likely fold. Also short stack: calling may commit us near all-in with weak hand. So fold.\n\nWe need to output JSON.\n\n",

With 5 BB, typical push/fold strategy: push all-in or fold. Raising to 64 is not all-in; you could raise to 64 then maybe get called, but you risk being re-raised. Better to go all-in (165) or at least raise all-in. Minimum raise is 64, but you can raise more up to your stack. So we can raise to 165 (all-in). Legal actions include raise, so we can raise to 165.\n\nConsider opponent stacks: Seat1 238, Seat2 149. Both have decent stacks. If we push all-in, they may call with wide range. QJ suited is decent but not premium; but with 5 BB, we need to be aggressive. According to push/fold tables, with 5 BB, QJs is often a push (maybe 20%+).

Actually BB posted 32, to raise to 64 you add 32 more. That would be a raise of 32 extra, total 64. But you can also go all-in 165. Need consider opponent seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) with 254 chips, likely will call? He is in SB? Actually seat1 posted SB 16, then seat5 is BB. So seat1 is SB, seat5 BB. SB already posted 16, BB posted 32. So preflop action: SB posted 16, BB posted 32, others folded. So it's just heads-up blind. Now it's our turn to act (BB) after SB posted? Actually order: SB posts, BB posts, then action starts with player left of BB, which is SB (seat1). But they already posted blind, they haven't acted yet. So the order: SB is first to act preflop. However actions list shows only blinds posting, not betting. So we need to act after SB? Actually SB's action hasn't been shown, but they are still to act. Since it's our position BB, after posting blind, we act last preflop. So the amount to call is 16 (SB's blind). So we can call 16 to see flop (i.e., just match SB). We can also raise to 64 min raise. With 9-7 unsuited, short stack, not a good hand. Better to fold and preserve chips? But we have only 5 BB, folding leaves us 165 still. If we call, we invest 16 and see flop with weak hand. Might be okay to call if we think we can steal later? But with 9-7 off, not great. Could also go all-in to try to double up. But it's a weak hand, not advisable.\n\nGiven tournament, short stack, need to pick spots. With 5 BB, you should be looking to steal blinds or go all-in with decent range. 9-7 off is not a good candidate. So folding is likely.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Actually seat1 posted SB 16, seat5 is BB posted 32. So the only opponent left is seat1 (SB) who posted 16 and hasn't acted yet? Actually actions: seat5 post_sb 16 (that's us? Wait seat5 is BB, but they posted sb 16? That's weird: seat5 post_sb 16 means they posted small blind? But seat5 is BB seat, but maybe seat numbers are not standard. According to actions: seat5 post_sb 16, seat1 post_bb 32. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB with 3c7c, opponent is BB with 32. The amount to call is 16 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., raise 48 more). Our stack 314, can raise.\n\nWe need to decide fold/call/raise. 3c7c is a very weak hand, especially out of position (SB vs BB? Actually SB is first to act preflop after posting SB, then BB acts, but here we are SB and we act first? Actually order preflop: SB acts first, then BB. So we are first to act. We have 3c7c, not a good hand. Usually fold. However we might consider a steal? But SB cannot steal, because BB is bigger blind. Stealing is from later positions. SB can raise to try to isolate, but with such weak hand, not advisable. Stack is 9.8 BB, short stack but not ultra short. Should fold.\n\nCheck opponent's raise tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised large amounts preflop often (119,87,190,238,286). Those are likely from BB when they raise. So they are aggressive. If they raise now, we would be out of position. So folding is correct.\n\nThus action: fold.",

Opponents: seat1 SB 16 chips, seat2 BB 32 chips, seat4 folded, we are BTN.\n\nAmount to call 32 (BB). Minimum raise to 64 (so raise of 32 additional). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand Ts4c is weak, suited but low kicker. On button, with short stack (~10 BB) we could consider stealing blind by raising, but hand is weak. However with 10 BB, we might want to shove if raise is not enough? Minimum raise is 64, which is 2 BB raise (i.e., 2x big blind). That would be 64 total, i.e., we put 64 chips in, net profit 64-32 = 32 additional? Actually raise to 64 means we add 32 chips (call 32 + 32). That's a 2 BB raise. With 10 BB, a 2 BB raise is small, might be called by BB and SB.\n\nBut typical button steal is 2.5-3 BB. Here 2 BB is maybe okay. But hand is very weak; risk of being called and losing 32 chips. But losing 32 chips is about 10% of stack. Could be okay.\n\nWe need consider opponent tendencies: Seat1 SB has raised amounts ranging from 8 to 286 (varied). Many raises are larger, sometimes huge (286). Could be aggressive. Seat2 BB raises also varied, sometimes large. Both may be capable of 3-betting.\n\nBut we are facing no raise yet; they just posted blinds. So we can raise to steal.\n\nGiven short stack, we could also go all-in (314) but that is too much for a weak hand.\n\nBetter to fold? Many players will call small raise with any pair. Our hand has no pair, low chance to improve. But button advantage and steal potential.\n\nWhat is typical push/fold threshold at 10 BB? Usually push with any hand that has equity > ~15% vs 2 players. Ts4c is about 12% vs 2 random? Might be borderline. But we could just raise to 64 to attempt steal; if called, we can fold later.\n\nThus I think raise to 64 is reasonable.\n\nReasoning: button, short stack, blind steal, hand not great but acceptable for small raise.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 64.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop with Ts4c (ten of spades, four of clubs) on button, stack 250, blinds 16/32, pot 306 (including blinds and raise). Action history: SB (Seat1) posted 16, BB (Seat2) posted 32. Seat5 (us) raised 64 (so 64 total? Actually raise to 64 meaning we put 64 total, i.e., 32 raise? Let's assume we raised to 64 total). Then Seat1 re-raised to 121 (so total 121). Seat2 called 89 (so they put 89 more? Actually they called the raise to 121, meaning they put 121 total, but they already had 32 blind, so they call 89). Now amount to call is 57 (so we need to put 57 more to match 121). Minimum raise to 178 (i.e., raise total to at least 178). Our stack is 250, we have already put 64, so remaining 186. So we could raise to 178 (which would be additional 114). Or we could go all-in (250). Need to decide based on hand strength: Ts4c is a weak hand, especially off-suit, low kicker, low connectivity. In button, but facing a 3-bet from SB (who likely is short stack 16 chips? Actually SB has 16 chips total? Wait seat1 has 16 chips total, which is exactly the small blind amount, they are short stacked. They posted 16, then re-raised to 121, which is more than their stack? They have 16 total, can't raise. Something off: seat1 has 16 chips total, but they posted sb 16, then raise 121? That's impossible. Maybe the stack numbers are current after posting? Actually seat1: 16 chips (maybe after posting, they have 0 left). But they raise to 121? That seems inconsistent. Could be a mistake: maybe seat1's stack is 160? But given data, seat1 16 chips, seat2 60 chips, seat4 192 chips folded, we are 250. So seat1 is extremely short, maybe they are all-in for 16? But they raise to 121? That doesn't make sense. Possibly the \"post_sb 16\" means they posted 16, then later they raise to 121 (so they must have more chips). Could be a formatting error. Anyway, we have to decide.\n\nGiven we have a weak hand, and we face a 3-bet (raise to 121) from SB, and a call from BB. Our stack is 7.8 BB, we are short-stacked. In tournament, short stack, we need to pick up chips. Ts4c is not a good candidate to 3-bet or call. We could fold. But we already have 64 in pot, and amount to call is 57 to see flop. With 7.8 BB, calling 57 is about 1.8 BB (since BB 32). That's a small amount, could be a steal attempt? But we are out of position after flop? Actually we are button, so after flop we will be first to act (since blinds are before us). Actually position: SB is seat1, BB seat2, we are seat5 button, so after flop action order: SB, BB, then button. So we will be last preflop (we raised), then SB 3-bet, BB called, now it's our turn. If we call, we will be out of position postflop (since SB and BB act before us). That's not ideal with weak hand.\n\nGiven hand is weak, we should fold. Also stack is short; we might consider all-in if we had a decent hand, but we don't.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\nWe need to output JSON.\n\n",

Currently we have posted 32 BB, plus we haven't added any. If raise to 32, that's just call? Actually amount to call is 0, min raise to 32 means we need to put 32 chips total (i.e., bet 32). So raise to 32 would be a bet of 32 chips, making pot 108. That is 0.5 BB? Actually 32 is 1 BB. So bet 32 into 76 pot, ~0.42 pot. Could be a small bet to try to steal? Opponent may have strong hand (maybe KQ, etc). Our chance of improvement: need Ten on river for straight (9 outs? Actually four tens left). Also could improve with J? Pair J on river gives pair J, but board already has K Q, so pair J is low, likely lose. So not great.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should fold?

We have J\u2665, which gives us an open-ended straight draw? Let's see: board shows K Q 5 7 3. Our J gives potential straight with 10 and 9? Actually we need 10 and 9 to make straight: 9-10-J-Q-K would be straight, but we have only J. No 10 or 9 on board. So not a made hand. No pair. So we have high card J, not even a pair. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has checked all streets, so likely also has weak hand or maybe a draw. River check; we can check. Raising would be a bluff. We have 6.8 BB left, short stack. Pot is 76, we have 218 chips total, but after posting BB 32, we have 186 left. Actually stack includes posted blind? Usually stack includes after posting. So we have 218 chips total (including blind). Pot 76 includes our blind 32? Yes. So we have 218-32=186 remaining. Minimum raise is 32 (to total 64). That's a small raise relative to pot (pot 76). Could attempt a bluff to steal, but opponent may have a hand like KQ, QJ, etc. Board has KQ, so many combos. Opponent checking could indicate missed draw or weak. But we are short stacked; we want to accumulate chips. Could raise to 100? Minimum raise is 32 (to total 64). We could raise more if we want. But we have limited chips, but can still raise up to all-in (218). But opponent may call with any pair, like K, Q, etc. Our hand is worthless. So best is to check and preserve stack. Since amount to call is 0, checking is safe.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually actions: seat5 post_sb 16 (small blind?), seat1 post_bb 32 (big blind). Wait seat numbers: seat5 is us, but they posted SB? Usually SB is seat left of dealer. But they said Position: BB (Seat5). Yet actions show seat5 post_sb 16 (small blind) and seat1 post_bb 32 (big blind). So maybe the dealer is seat? Anyway we are in BB but we posted SB? Might be confusion. But amount to call is 16, meaning we need to call 16 to match the big blind? Actually big blind is 32, we posted small blind 16, so we need to call 16 more to complete the BB. So no raise yet. So we can call 16 (complete blind) or raise min 64 (to total 64). With 6c5s, a weak suited connector, short stack 6 BB. Should we call? In tournament early, we want to preserve chips but also maybe steal. 6c5s is not a good hand to call blind with. However we are already half blind; we could just call and see flop, but with 6 BB, maybe we want to raise to try to steal? But min raise to 64 total (i.e., raise 48 more). That's 2 BB raise (actually 64 total includes our 16 already posted? Not sure). So raise to 64 would be 48 more, making total bet 64. That's 2 BB raise. With 6c5s, not a good raise.

So we cannot call full amount; we can go all-in for remaining 170, which would be a call all-in (less than amount to call). Is that allowed? In poker, you can go all-in for less than bet, it's considered a call. So legal action includes call (meaning you can call all-in). So we can call all-in of 170 (i.e., go all-in). Decision: With 6c5s, short stack, facing a raise from BB (who is presumably a short stack too? Actually seat1 has 32 chips, but that's their stack after posting BB? Actually seat1 stack is 32 chips total? That seems they are also short. They have only 32 chips left (i.e., they are on the brink). So they raise to 242, but they only have 32? Something off. The stack numbers: seat1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 32 chips (maybe that's their stack after posting BB?). So they have 32 chips total, posted BB 32, they have no remaining chips. How can they raise? Actually they can't raise beyond their stack; maybe the numbers are misaligned: The \"players at table\" shows chip counts before posting blinds? Usually you list current stack before posting. So seat1 has 32 chips total, posted BB 32, now they have 0 left, but they raise to 242? That is impossible. Something off. Possibly the chip counts are after posting blinds? Or maybe the numbers are just placeholders. We need to decide action.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, 6-5 unsuited, short stack, and facing a raise from BB (who may be a short stack, but raising big). Likely we should fold. The raise is 242, which is huge relative to pot (274). Our hand has low equity. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON with fold.\n\n",

If we raise to 32, he would be forced to go all-in for his remaining 4, we would have to call 4 to win the pot. That might be okay: we risk 4 chips to win 80+32?

So if he calls, we have 32+4 = 36 in the pot from us (32 + we will call 4? Actually we already put 32, we need to match his 4? Usually you would just match his all-in, but you already have 32, which is more than 4, so you are already ahead. So you don't need to add more chips. So you would just win the pot of 80+32+4=116.

That's a risk.\n\nGiven we have no showdown value, raising is a bluff. Opponent is short, maybe will call with any pair or Ace high? He called preflop 32, maybe he has a hand like A? Not sure.

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand: 2d Kc, board: Ts 5d 6s 5s. So board shows pair of fives and a ten. Our hand: King high, no pair, no straight draw (2-5-6-10). No flush draw (two spades on board, we have Kc, 2d, no spade). So very weak hand, basically just king high. Opponent seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 4 chips left (tiny). They are short stacked. They are on the button? Actually seat 2 is after seat 1 (folded) and before seat 3 (folded). So seat 2 is UTG? Not relevant. They have 4 chips, so they are essentially all-in or about to be forced. They called preflop 32 (so they had at least 32 chips). Wait they have 4 chips now? The stack after preflop? Actually stack shown is current stack before turn: seat2 has 4 chips. So they are short-stacked, likely all-in preflop? They called 32, but they only have 4 chips left now, meaning they must have posted an all-in? But the actions: preflop: seat2 call 32. So they had at least 32 chips preflop. After posting 32, they'd have 4 chips left (since they had 36?). So they are now short-stacked with 4 chips left. So they are effectively all-in for 4 more chips? Actually they are not all-in; they have 4 chips left to act. On turn, amount to call is 0 (no bet). So they can check or bet? They have 4 chips; they could bet but not in legal actions for us: we have legal actions: fold, check, raise. So we can raise to at least 32 (minimum raise). But we only have 202 chips. Raising to 32 would be a raise of 32 (since amount to call 0). But opponent only has 4 chips left, they cannot call a raise of 32; they'd be forced to fold. So raising is a bluff to win the pot of 80 chips, but we risk committing chips. Since opponent is short, they may be willing to go all-in for 4 chips. But they have no bet now; they could bet 4 chips (but not in our legal actions). Actually it's our turn, we have legal actions: fold, check, raise. So we cannot bet less than min raise (32). So raising would be a huge overbet relative to their stack; they'd fold. So best is to check, let them check, go to river. But we have no chance to win anyway. However maybe we can check and hope they bet small (they can't bet less than min raise? Actually they also have same legal actions when it's their turn: they'd have same min raise 32, but they only have 4 chips, so they'd be forced to go all-in (bet their remaining 4) maybe considered a bet? Not sure. Usually if a player has less than the minimum raise, they can go all-in for that amount. So they could bet 4 all-in. If they do, we can call 4 (call) and lose anyway. But if we check, they might check and we go to river, still lose. So either way we lose. But maybe we could raise to 32 to push them out, then win the pot uncontested. That costs us 32 chips, but we win 80 chips, net +48 chips. That's a good move: we effectively steal the pot from a short stack with no bet. Since they cannot call, they will fold. So raising is profitable. However we must consider tournament: we have 6.3 BB, raising 32 is about 0.16 BB? Actually blinds are 16/32, so 32 is 1 BB. So raise to 32 (i.e., bet 32) is a standard raise. That's fine. So we should raise to 32 to steal. Reason: we have weak hand, opponent short stack, can't call.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 32. Reasoning: we are stealing the pot, opponent cannot call.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed. Minimum raise to 32. So we raise to 32.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need decide action with Qd5d on button, short stack 2.6 BB (166 chips). Blinds: SB 32, BB 64, pot 96. Effective stacks: we have 166, others have 290, 8 (tiny), 0, 184. We are short stacked, need to find best move: either shove all-in (raise to 166) or call 64 or fold. Hand Q5 suited is weak, not a good shoving hand. But we could call and hope to see flop? With 2.6 BB, calling 64 leaves 102 left, still short. Better to shove all-in to maximize fold equity? But Q5 suited is not a good all-in; may get called by better hands, lose. However, with such short stack, you may need to pick a hand to go all-in. Typically you push with any Ace, broadway, suited connectors, etc. Q5 is borderline. Might consider folding.\n\nWe can also check opponent tendencies: seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat 2 is Kimi-K2 with 8 chips (short). Seat 2 is already all-in? Actually seat 2 posted BB 64, not all-in. So if we call 64, we will be left with 102 chips. Could we later be forced to push later? Might be okay.\n\nGiven hand strength: Q5 suited has some potential to hit flush or straight, but low equity vs typical ranges. In button vs SB and BB, we could attempt to steal by raising. Minimum raise is 128 total, which would be raise to 128 (i.e., add 64 more). That would be a raise of 64 more, total put in 128. Our stack 166, so raise to 128 leaves 38 behind. That's a small raise, not all-in. Could also raise all-in to 166.\n\nBut legal actions include raise. We could raise to 166 (all-in) to apply pressure; SB may fold, BB may call with a wide range? BB has 64 already, so they'd have to call 102 more. They might call with many hands given they are short? Actually BB has 64 blind, but stack 64? Wait seat 2 is BB with 64 chips, that's his entire stack. So BB is effectively all-in already (post blind). So if we raise, we are raising against a blind that is already all-in? Actually the BB's 64 is his stack, so he's all-in. So raising would be a re-raise (i.e., we would be raising over the BB's all-in, which is not allowed because you can't raise over an all-in? In poker, you can only call the all-in or fold. So legal actions should be fold, call, raise? But raise is not possible because opponent is all-in? However system says raise is legal. Possibly they treat BB as just a blind, not all-in. Actually stack 64 equals blind amount, but he could have more chips? No stack is 8 chips for seat 2? Wait seat 2 is Kimi-K2 - 8 chips. Oh sorry, seat 2 has 8 chips total, posted BB 64? That can't be; maybe seat 2 is the BB with 8 chips left after posting? Actually they posted BB 64, but stack says 8 chips; contradictory. Might be that seat 2's stack is 8 chips after posting? So they are effectively all-in for 8? Not sure.\n\nGiven confusion, we treat as normal: we can call 64 to match BB, then SB may act later.\n\nGiven short stack, best is to go all-in with any hand that has some equity. Q5 suited is not great but could be okay. However folding preserves chips for better spot. Since we have 2.6 BB, we are in danger of being blinded out. If we fold, we lose 0 chips but will be forced to post blinds later and likely be eliminated. Might be better to shove.\n\nI think we should raise all-in (to 166) as a shove.\n\nReasoning: short stack, button, want to steal blinds, Q5 suited has some flush potential, and we can apply pressure. So raise to 166.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Seat 1 folded. Seat 2 called 16? Actually seat 2 is out, but they call 16? weird. Anyway we have to decide action. With AA in BB, short stack 56 in seat 4, they have called 32 (post sb 32? Actually seat 4 posted sb 32, then called 32? That seems they called the big blind? So they have 56 stack, they are short. We have 198 chips, 3.1 BB. Minimum raise is 128 (i.e., raise to 128 total). That would be a raise of 64 (since BB is 64). But we have short stack opponent; we might want to go all-in to extract value. All-in amount would be 198 (our whole stack). But can we raise to that? Minimum raise is 128, we can raise to any amount up to our stack? Usually yes, we can raise all-in. Should we? With AA, it's best to max value. Opponent has 56 chips, they are already in for 32 (call). If we raise all-in, they may call or fold. But they might be forced to call all-in? Actually they have 56 chips total, they already posted 32 (sb) and called 32 (so they have 56 left? Wait they had 56 total chips, posted 32 sb, then call 32 to match BB? That uses all 56. So they are all-in already! Indeed they posted sb 32, then call 32 (i.e., they match the BB 64 total). So they are all-in for 56 total (but they have no chips left). So the pot is now: BB 64, SB 32, plus their call 32? Actually the pot: BB 64, SB 32, plus seat2 call 16? Not relevant. The amount to call is 0. So we are in a situation where opponent is all-in for 56 chips. We have AA. We can check (i.e., call the all-in) which is effectively winning the pot. So best is to check (call) to win the pot. No need to raise. So action: check.\n\nThus JSON with check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with AA, stack 198, pot 144 after flop. Opponent MiniMax-M2 (Seat4) checked. It's a very strong hand, but we are short stacked (3.1 BB). We want to maximize value but also consider risk of being called by worse hand. With AA vs unknown range (likely some weak hand, maybe draws). We could check to see a free card, but risk giving free turn card that could improve opponent. Better to bet for value. Minimum raise to 64, that would be raise to 64 total (i.e., bet 64). That would be about half pot (pot 144, bet 64 makes pot 208). Opponent has 56 chips left, less than raise amount, so if we raise to 64, it's more than his stack; he could only call all-in 56? Actually raise to 64 means we put total 64 chips into pot (including our existing 64 blind?). Wait we are in BB, we posted 64. The pot is 144 includes our 64, opponent's 32 call, seat2 call 16, seat1 fold, seat4 call 32? Let's compute: Preflop: seat4 post sb 32, seat5 post bb 64, seat1 fold, seat2 call 16 (maybe small blind?), seat4 call 32 (call to BB), seat5 check (BB). So preflop pot: 32+64+16+32 = 144. Yes.\n\nNow flop: seat4 check, amount to call 0. Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., bet 64). But opponent only has 56 chips left, less than 64, so we can raise all-in for 56 (or raise to 64 which would be more than his stack, effectively all-in). We need to see legal actions: raise is allowed. So we should raise all-in (i.e., raise to 198 total? Actually we have 198 total stack, we have already 64 in pot, remaining 134. Opponent has 56. Minimum raise to 64 means total bet of 64 (including our previous 64?), but we have already contributed 64 preflop, but that counts to our stack? Usually raise amount is additional chips beyond call. But the spec says raise_to is total amount you're putting in. So raise_to 64 would be total contribution after raise? That seems ambiguous. Usually raise to 64 means total bet of 64, but we already have 64 in pot, so raise to 64 is just check? Actually amount to call is 0, so a raise to 64 would be putting 64 more chips, total contribution 128. That would exceed opponent's stack. So we could raise to 120 (all-in). But legal actions minimum raise to 64 indicates you must bet at least 64 more? That's typical: minimum raise = big blind amount = 64. So we could raise to 64 more, i.e., total 128, but opponent only has 56 left, so they'd be forced all-in for 56. That's fine.\n\nThus we should raise (all-in) to maximize value. Reason: AA is nuts, short stack, need chips, opponent may call with any pair or draw. So raise all-in.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to maybe 120? But we need to follow spec: raise_to total amount we are putting in. Our total stack is 198, we already have 64 in pot, remaining 134. If we go all-in, total contribution becomes 64+134=198. So raise_to 198. That is allowed? Minimum raise is 64, we can raise more. So raise_to 198.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #105 preflop. Position BB, stack 246 (3.8 BB). Blind levels 32/64. So BB posted 64, SB posted 32. Pot 96. Opponent seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has 218 chips, presumably is the SB? Actually seat1 is SB? Wait seat numbers: seat5 is us (BB). seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 218 chips. The blinds: seat5 post_sb 32 (that's weird: seat5 posted small blind? Actually they say preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 32, Seat1 post_bb 64. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But we are BB seat5? The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". Yet actions show seat5 posted sb. Something contradictory. Probably seat5 is SB but they label position BB incorrectly? Actually maybe the table is 5 players? But they show seat4 fold. The blinds: seat5 posted sb 32, seat1 posted bb 64. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are actually SB, not BB. But the description says BB. Might be a mistake. We'll treat as we are SB (small blind) with 32 posted, facing a BB of 64. The amount to call is 32 (to call BB). Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., raise total to 128). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nOur hand: Ac 3h (Ace low, unsuited). Very weak hand, especially out of position (if we are SB vs BB). Stack shallow 3.8 BB total; after posting SB we have 214 chips left? Actually stack 246 includes posted blinds? Usually stack includes chips before posting? They gave stack 246 chips (3.8 BB). After posting SB 32, we have 214 left. So we can call 32 to see flop, leaving 182 chips (2.8 BB). Raising to 128 would be a raise of 96 more (total 128). That's a huge raise for a weak hand. Considering we are short-stacked, we could consider all-in but we have 246 chips total; all-in is 246. That's more than 4 BB. Might be okay to push all-in with Ace high? But Ace low 3 is not strong.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2's raise sizes: early small raises 6, 12, 16, 24, 40, 48, 32, 133. This indicates they sometimes raise big (133) relative to blind (maybe deep). But in this tournament, stack sizes vary. The raise amounts listed are not relative to blind; need to know typical stack. Hard to interpret. But they have raised 32 before (hand 80). So they can raise to 32 preflop. The minimum raise is 128, so raising to 128 is a 2x BB raise.\n\nGiven our weak hand, short stack, we likely should fold. Calling 32 is cheap but we have Ace high; could see flop, but with only 2.8 BB left, we risk being out of position and may be forced to fold later. However Ace-high sometimes wins at showdown. But with such low stack, we want to preserve chips; but also we need to accumulate chips to survive. Our stack 3.8 BB is low; we need to double up soon. But Ace 3 is not a good candidate to double up.\n\nThus folding is prudent.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Wait they started 48 chips, posted 32 sb, then called 32 = total 64, which exceeds their stack. Something off. Actually seat 4 has 48 chips total, posted 32 sb, then call 32 would be all-in (they only have 16 left). Probably they are all-in for remaining 16.

The pot shown 128 maybe includes both. Anyway we face no bet, amount to call 0, we can check or raise. With 2.8 BB, we are short. Pocket sevens are a medium pair; against a short stack all-in, we might consider calling to win chips. But we have only 2.8 BB, raising would commit more and possibly get called by someone else? Only opponent left. So best is to call (i.e., check) because amount to call is 0, but we want to match the all-in? Actually opponent is already all-in, we can call by checking? In poker software, if opponent is all-in, you can call the all-in amount; but amount to call is 0 because they already are all-in? The pot includes their all-in, we can either call (match) but they are already all-in, we need to put chips equal to their bet (which is 48 total). Our BB already posted 64, which is more than their bet, so we are already covered? Actually we posted 64, they bet 48 total, we have already contributed 64, so we are ahead, we are effectively already covering their bet, so we can check and win the pot if they are all-in.

So we need a 10 and a 6 to make two possible straights? Wait 6-7-8-9-10 uses 6 and 10, board has 8,9, we have 7, need 6 and 10. So we have open-ended straight draw?

Actually 6-7-8-9-10 also need 10. So only 10 gives straight. So we have a gutshot straight draw (needs a ten).

Opponent MiniMax-M2 is short stack 48 chips (0.75 BB). They are in SB (post_sb 32) and called preflop 32, now flop check. They have 48 chips total, including their blind? They posted 32 SB, then called 32 to match BB, so they have 48 left (including 32 already in pot?). Actually stack after posting SB 32, call 32 (to match BB) they have 48 chips remaining (not counting the 64 in pot). So they are very short. Their stack is 48 chips. The pot is 128. So effective stack for them is 48, which is less than pot. They are essentially all-in potential. On flop, they checked. It's our turn, amount to call 0. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., raise to 64 total? Actually raise to total amount 64, which would be a raise of 64 chips from current 0? But we already have 64 in pot as BB, but raise to 64 would be adding 64 more? Typically raise_to is total bet amount. Since amount to call 0, a raise to 64 means we put 64 chips into pot. That would be a raise of 64, which is double the BB. That would be a bet of 64.\n\nGiven opponent's short stack (48), a raise to 64 would be more than they can call; they'd be forced to go all-in for 48 if they want to call.

This is a bet of 64 into a pot of 128, pot odds for them: need to call 48 to win 192 (pot 128 + 64 + opponent's 48 call). So they need ~25% equity. They might call with any J, 9, 8, maybe straight draws, etc. But they are short, maybe they will shove all-in anyway.\n\nWe have pocket sevens, not strong. Should we check and hope they check back?

          "reasoning_content": "We have a hand on turn. Board: 9s 8c Jh 2c. Our hand: 7s 7d, a pocket pair of sevens. So we have a pair, currently not a set (no 7 on board). The board shows possible straight draws: 9-8-J gives open-ended straight draws? Actually 9-8-J, the missing 10 and Q would make straight. Our 7s doesn't help. Also possible flush draws? Board has spade 9s, club 8c, hearts J?, actually J is hearts? board says Jh (hearts). 2c clubs. So only one spade, one heart, two clubs. No flush possibilities for us.\n\nWe have 7-7, currently second pair? Actually board has J,9,8,2. Our pair is lower than any pair on board (none). So we have just a middle pair (sevens). Opponent (MiniMax-M2) is seat 4, with 48 chips left (short stack). They have checked all streets. So they are likely low stack, maybe they are short and may be all-in later. Now it's our turn, amount to call is 0, min raise is 64. Our stack is 182 chips, we could raise to 64 (minimum raise). But we need to consider that opponent only has 48 chips left. So we could bet (raise) to 64, which would be more than opponent's stack, effectively putting them all-in for 48? Actually if we raise to 64, they'd have to call 64, but they only have 48, so they'd be all-in for 48, we could call their all-in. But we could also just check and see if they bet later. However they are short-stacked and may be looking to shove. Our hand is weak. We have only a pair of sevens, not a strong hand. The opponent could have a better hand (e.g., 10-? for straight draw, or Jx for top pair, or 9x, 8x). They could also have a weaker hand and be trying to shove.\n\nGiven we have only 2.8 BB, we are also short. We need to consider tournament life. If we can win the opponent's 48 chips, we increase stack. If we raise to 64, we risk losing more if opponent calls with a better hand. But opponent checking suggests they may be weak or waiting to shove. Could we check and then if they bet, we can decide? Since amount to call is 0, checking is safe. Raising might scare them off if they have weak hand; they may fold, losing 48 chips to us anyway (we get nothing). Actually if we raise to 64, they can fold, we win nothing. If we check, they could bet any amount up to 48 (their stack). If they bet, we could decide to call or fold. With a pair of sevens, likely we are behind many hands. So maybe best to check and fold to any bet.\n\nThus I will check.\n\nLegal actions include fold, check, raise. Check is allowed. So choose \"check\".",

Actually 7-8-9-J is not a straight; need 10 for 8-9-10-J. 7-8-9-J is missing 10. 7-8-9-J is not a straight. 7-8-9-J-? No. 7-8-9-J-? Not a straight. Also 6c on turn gives 6-7-8-9-J? That's still not a straight. Need 10 for straight, or 5 for 5-6-7-8-9. We have 6c and 7s, so we have 5-6-7-8-9? No 5 not on board.

Minimum raise is 64 (i.e., raise to 64 total? Actually raise_to is total amount you put in, not additional. So raising to 64 means you put total 64 chips in pot, i.e., you add 64? But you already have 0 contributed on river. So you'd be betting 64. That's about half pot. Could be a bluff. But with 2.8 BB, you might want to go all-in to try to steal blinds? But it's river, not blinds. The pot is 128, your stack 182, you could go all-in 182. That could be a move.

          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 4c3c, very weak, low stack 4.3 BB. There's a small blind posted 32 (seat5)?? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Wait: seat5 post_sb 32, seat1 post_bb 64. So seat5 is SB? Actually seat5 is BB? The description says Position: BB (Seat5). But actions show seat5 posted SB 32, seat1 posted BB 64. Maybe reversed: seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But we are in BB? Regardless, we are in big blind with 4c3c, stack 278, blinds 32/64, pot 96. We have to call 32 to see flop. With 4.3 BB, we could consider shove? Minimum raise to 128, that's a raise of 64 (since call is 32). But we have 278 chips, we could go all-in for 278? Minimum raise is 128 (total). All-in is allowed if can't meet min raise? Actually we can raise to any amount >= min raise. All-in of 278 is > min raise, so legal. However hand is very weak, and short stack. Should we fold? With 4c3c unsuited, low chance of winning. Short stack, maybe shove to steal? But we are out of position (big blind) with 4c3c, opponents likely have called or raised? Actually only SB posted 32, BB posted 64, no other players. So we are heads-up vs SB. SB posted 32, we have to call 32 to see flop. The SB may be a short stack (194 chips). Could they be likely to raise? No raise yet. So we can call 32 and see flop cheap. With 4c3c, we have potential for straight draws. But we have only 4.3 BB; calling 32 leaves us with 246 chips, still short. If we call and miss, we may be forced to fold later. But we can also shove all-in to apply pressure; SB only has 194 chips, could fold. However with such weak hand, risk is high. Expected value: If we shove, we win 194 chips if opponent folds, lose 278 if they call and we lose (which is likely). Opponent may call with a wide range? In short stack, they might call with any pair, maybe A-high. Our equity vs random hand is low ~10%. So not good. Better to fold? But folding loses 64 already posted? Actually we already posted BB 64, we can fold and lose that. Calling costs 32 extra, but gives chance to win pot of 96 + opponent's 32 = 128? Actually pot before action is 96 (SB 32 + BB 64). If we call 32, pot becomes 128. Expected value: we invest 32 to possibly win 128 (net +96). Our chance to win maybe 10% => EV = 0.1*96 - 0.9*32 = 9.6 - 28.8 = -19.2. So negative. So fold is better.\n\nThus action: fold.",

So we have two outs: 6s (any suit) 4 cards, plus A (4 cards). Total 8 outs. Not many.\n\nStack is 246, pot 112, we are short stacked (3.8 BB). Opponent (Seat1) checked. We are on button, short stack, need chips. Options: check (to see turn cheap) or raise (maybe steal). But raising might be good to try to pick up pot, but opponent may call and we could be dominated? Our hand is weak, but we could try to bluff with raise to steal blinds? However opponent is SB (post 32), we are BTN, they have 258 chips, similar stack. They checked flop, maybe they have nothing. Raising could be effective if they are passive. But we have only 246 chips left, we could go all-in? Minimum raise to 64, which is small relative to stack. Could raise to say 150? But raise_to must be total amount we put in. If we raise to 150, we invest 150 chips, leaving ~96. That may be too much with weak hand. Perhaps check and hope to see turn cheap.\n\nCheck is safe, but we may want to steal now. Evaluate pot odds: If we call a raise later we might be forced. Since we have 8 outs, about 8*2=16% chance to hit on turn, plus maybe runner-runner. Not great.\n\nGiven short stack, we could go all-in to try to double up. Opponent may call with any Ace, 6, pair, etc. But they have checked, maybe they have middle pair or overcards. If they have T, they'd likely raise. They checked, maybe they have weak. So a shove could be good.\n\nBut raise to 64 is min, that's 2 BB (since big blind 64). That's a small raise; opponent could call and we still have 182 left. Not much pressure.\n\nI think best is to raise all-in to try to double up, given short stack and weak hand but potential for fold equity. Let's see legal actions: fold, check, raise. All-in is a raise to total stack 246? That's allowed if can't meet min raise? Actually we can raise to any amount up to stack. Minimum raise is 64, we can raise to 246 (all-in). So raise.\n\nReason: short stack, need chips, opponent checked, likely weak, we can attempt to steal.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 246.\n\n"

Wait actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 32 (so seat5 is SB? But position says BTN seat5. In a 5-player? Actually blinds: SB is seat5? Usually BTN is after BB. But they posted SB. Might be a mislabel: seat5 posted SB, seat1 posted BB. So we are in SB (small blind) with 3s Qs. Stack 326 chips, 5.1 BB. So we are short-stacked, must act after BB. Amount to call is 32 (to call BB). Minimum raise to 128 (i.e., raise 96 more). With Q3 suited, short stack, you could consider shove (all-in) if raise to 326? Actually you can raise to any amount >=128. With 5 BB, typical strategy: push or fold unless you have good hand. Q3 suited is weak, but could be a push if you think you are short and want to steal blinds? However you are in SB, not BTN. There are only two players left (SB and BB). You can either call 32 to see flop, or raise to try to steal BB. With such a short stack, you could go all-in to try to double up. But Q3 suited is not a good hand to shove; but with 5 BB, many push/fold strategy: push with any hand above a certain equity threshold. Q3 suited is about 25% equity vs random BB? Might be okay to shove? However many players will call with any pair, A-x, etc. Might be risky. Better to just call the BB and see flop? But with 5 BB, calling 32 leaves you with 294 behind, still short. You could also fold to preserve stack for better spot. Usually with 5 BB, you push or fold, not call. So decision: push all-in (raise to 326). Reason: short stack, want to steal blinds; Q3 suited has some suitedness and queen high may be decent.\n\nLegal actions include raise; we can raise to all-in.

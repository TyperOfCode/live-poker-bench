With this stack size and a premium hand, I should be looking to get my chips in\n4. **Opponents**: Only SB and BB left to act. Both have decent stacks (157 and 123 chips respectively)\n5. **Action**: Everyone else has folded\n\n**Decision rationale:**\nWith AK on the button and a stack of <10 BB, this is a clear shove (all-in) situation. I want to maximize fold equity and when called, I'll have good equity against most ranges. \n\nIf I just call or make a small raise, I risk:\n- Missing value when I hit the flop\n- Letting the blinds see a cheap flop with speculative hands\n- Having to fold if I miss and they bet\n\nThe standard play with <10 BB and AK is to shove preflop. This gives me:\n- Maximum fold equity\n- Good equity when called (against any pair I'm roughly 45-50%, against weaker aces I'm dominating)\n- No tough post-flop decisions with a short stack\n\nI should raise to my full stack of 143 chips (all-in).",

This suggests I've been playing very tight, possibly too tight for tournament poker with a short stack.\n\nHowever, Q5o is simply too weak to call off 85% of my stack.

Actually the description says \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 0 chips (out)\". That seems like they're already out of the tournament but still in the hand? That's confusing.\n\nLet me check: Seat 1 has 0 chips but raised 143? That doesn't make sense unless they're all-in with 0? Maybe it's a misprint. Let me re-read: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 0 chips (out)\" - maybe they're eliminated but still showing? The action says \"preflop: Seat 1 raise 143\". If they have 0 chips, they can't raise 143. Something is off.\n\nActually, looking at the stacks: I have 123, Seat 2 has 157 (folded), Seat 4 has 295 (folded), Seat 5 has 258 (folded). Seat 1 has 0 chips but raised? Maybe they're all-in with their last 0? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe \"out\" means they're out of the hand? But then they wouldn't be acting. Or maybe it's a display issue - they have some chips but it shows 0.\n\nLet me think: The pot is 167 chips. Blinds are 8/16. SB posted 8, BB posted 16. That's 24 in the pot. Seat 4 and 5 folded. Then Seat 1 raised to 143. That would put 143 + 24 = 167 pot. Yes, that matches.\n\nBut if Seat 1 has 0 chips, they can't raise. So likely they have chips but it's showing 0 incorrectly, or \"out\" means something else.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide. I have 9d 2s, a terrible hand. I have 123 chips total. I already have 16 in as BB. To call, I need to put in 127 more, which would leave me with 0 (123 - 127 = -4? Actually 123 - 127 = -4, but I can't have negative). Wait, I have 123 total, I already put 16, so I have 107 left. To call 127, I'd need to put all 107 remaining? Let's calculate: My stack: 123 total. I already posted BB of 16, so I have 107 behind. The raise is to 143 total. I need to put in 143 - 16 = 127 more. But I only have 107 behind. So I can call all-in for 107 more. Actually, the amount to call is 127, but I only have 107 behind. So I can go all-in for my remaining 107.\n\nThe pot would then be: My 123 + opponent's 143? Let's think: If I go all-in for 123 total (my stack), opponent raised to 143, but they only need to match my all-in of 123? Actually, in poker, if I go all-in for less than their raise, they only need to call the difference to match my all-in. So if I go all-in for 123 total, they raised to 143, they would get back 20 (143-123=20) as change if they want to just call my all-in.\n\nBut the interface says \"Amount to call: 127\". That suggests I need to put 127 more to call. But I only have 107 behind. So maybe I can call all-in for 107 more, making my total contribution 16 + 107 = 123.\n\nLet me check the pot size: 167 chips. That includes: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 143? Actually 8+16+143=167. Yes.\n\nIf I call all-in for 107 more (total 123), the pot becomes: 167 (current) + 107 (my call) = 274. Opponent has 0 chips? Wait they have 0 chips according to display, but they raised 143. So they must have at least 143 chips. Actually they raised 143, so they have at least 143 chips. But display says 0 chips. This is confusing.\n\nMaybe \"out\" means they're all-in?

My stack is 123 chips (7.7 BB). Pot is 167. Amount to call is 127, but I only have 107 behind (since I already put 16 as BB). So I can call all-in for my remaining 107. The hand is very weak - 9d 2s is one of the worst possible hands. The opponent raised preflop, likely with a strong hand. With my short stack of 7.7 BB, I need to consider tournament survival. But calling with 9d 2s is terrible. Even with pot odds: pot is 167, I need to call 107. That's pot odds of 167:107, or about 1.56:1, meaning I need about 39% equity. 9d 2s has maybe 30% equity against a reasonable raising range. Actually worse. Against a top 20% range, 9d 2s has about 32% equity. So pot odds might justify a call if I think opponent is raising wide. But with my short stack, I should be looking for better spots. However, I'm getting decent pot odds: I'm putting in 107 to win 274 (167 current pot + my 107 call). That's 107 to win 274, or 2.56:1 pot odds. Wait, recalc: If I call all-in for 107 more, total pot would be: 167 (current) + 107 (my call) = 274. I'm contributing 107/274 = 39% of pot, so I need 39% equity. Against a random hand, 9d 2s has about 40% equity. Against a top 50% range, it has about 36%. Against a top 20% range, about 32%. So it's close.\n\nBut I need to consider opponent tendencies. Let me try to use tools quickly, but the system says invalid format. I need to just make a decision. I'll fold. 9d 2s is too weak, and with my short but not desperate stack (7.7 BB), I can wait for a better spot. Folding leaves me with 107 chips (6.7 BB), which is still playable. Calling and losing would eliminate me. So I'll fold.\n\nResponse should be JSON: {\"action\": \"fold\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"brief explanation\"}. Let me provide that.",

In this position, I need a very strong hand to play, as I'll be out of position for the entire hand and face action from all remaining players.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 295 chips (18.4 BB) - I'm at a comfortable stack depth, not short-stacked, so I can afford to fold and wait for a better spot.\n\n4. **Opponent Information**: From the recent history, I can see that most players have been folding frequently in recent hands, suggesting a tight table. However, this doesn't change the fundamental weakness of my hand.\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: I'm in a reasonable chip position and don't need to take marginal spots. Folding here preserves my stack for a better opportunity.\n\n6. **Hand Strength Analysis**: \n   - A3 offsuit is one of the weakest Ace-x hands\n   - In UTG position, this hand has very little equity\n   - Even if I hit my Ace, I'm likely dominated by any other Ace with a better kicker\n   - The 3 kicker provides minimal value even when I make a pair\n\nGiven all these factors, this is a clear fold. A3 offsuit from UTG is simply too weak to play profitably, especially when I have a reasonable stack and can wait for a better spot.\n\nThe amount to call is 16 chips (the big blind), but folding is definitely the correct play here.",

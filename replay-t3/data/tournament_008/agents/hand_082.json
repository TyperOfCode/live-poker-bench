            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 7s Qc - This is a marginal hand, offsuit and not connected. Q7o is generally a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. This is a significant advantage.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 190 chips (5.9 BB) - This is very short stacked, nearing the critical zone. We're in tournament play where survival matters.\n\n4. **Current action**: \n   - I posted SB (16)\n   - BB posted 32\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 32\n   - Seat 5 folded\n   - I need to call 16 more to see the flop\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 80 chips, I need to call 16. That's 5:1 pot odds. This is very attractive pot odds.\n\n6. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n   - Very tight player - folded preflop in 7 of last 10 hands\n   - When they did play (hand 78), they called preflop and then bet on the flop\n   - They seem to play straightforwardly - tight preflop, aggressive when they hit\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With only 5.9 BB, I need to be very careful. However, I'm getting 5:1 pot odds on my call, and I'm in position. The call is only 16 chips, which is about 8% of my stack. Even though Q7o is weak, the combination of position, pot odds, and the fact that MiniMax-M2 seems tight makes this a borderline call.\n\n8. **Strategic thinking**: \n   - If I call, I have position post-flop\n   - MiniMax-M2 likely has a decent but not premium hand (they called, didn't raise)\n   - I can easily fold if I miss the flop\n   - The investment is small relative to pot size\n   - However, with my short stack, I should be looking for better spots to get my money in\n\n9. **Decision**: While the pot odds are good and I have position, Q7o is just too weak, especially with my short stack. I should preserve my chips for a better spot where I can shove or make a stand with a stronger hand. The 16 chips represent about 8% of my stack, which isn't huge, but tournament survival is key here.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The pot odds are 5:1, I'm on the button, and it's only costing me 16 chips (8% of stack). If I hit a Q on the flop, I could be good against a tight player who might have weaker Qx or be overplaying a medium pair. Plus, I can easily fold if I miss. The combination of position and pot odds might make this a profitable call.\n\nBut wait - with 5.9 BB, I should be thinking about push/fold. Calling with marginal hands like this can lead to difficult post-flop situations where I bleed chips. The standard play with <10 BB is to either shove or fold preflop, not call.\n\nHowever, since I already have 16 invested as the SB, and I only need to call 16 more to win 80, that's excellent pot odds. This is a special situation because of the posted blind.\n\nLet me think about this differently: if I had 0 invested and it folded to me on the BTN with Q7o and 5.9 BB, I should fold. But I've already invested 16 chips (the SB). \n\nI realize the SB is a sunk cost. Tournament ICM considerations are crucial here. With extremely short stacks, every chip matters. Despite the tempting pot odds, my marginal hand and vulnerable position make folding the most prudent choice. The potential to lose more chips outweighs the slim chance of winning this hand.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. I have Ace of hearts and 5 of hearts (A5 suited) in UTG position\n2. I'm short-stacked with 192 chips (6 BB)\n3. Blinds are 16/32, so I need to call 32 chips to see the flop\n4. Looking at my recent history, I've been folding a lot (59 folds out of 81 hands, 25.9% win rate)\n5. In my recent hands, I've been playing quite tight, mostly folding preflop\n6. From opponent actions, I can see:\n   - Kimi-K2 has been active with raises (hand 80: raise to 32, hand 81: raise to 87)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been calling and raising (hand 79: raise to 48, hand 81: call 16 then call 55)\n\nA5 suited is a decent hand, especially in a tournament setting where I need to accumulate chips. In UTG position, it's usually too weak to raise, but given my short stack and the fact that I'm getting good pot odds to call (32 chips to win 48), this could be a spot to play.\n\nThe key considerations:\n- I'm in early position (UTG) which is a disadvantage\n- My stack is getting low (6 BB), so I need to be selective but also take opportunities\n- A5 suited has decent playability and can make straights and flushes\n- I'm getting 1.5:1 pot odds to call (32 to win 48)\n\nGiven my recent tight play and the fact that I need to accumulate chips to stay relevant in the tournament, I think calling here is reasonable. If I hit an Ace, I can potentially get value. If I hit a 5, I have a smaller pair. The suited nature gives me flush potential.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that in UTG position, I'm likely to face action from later positions, and A5 suited is vulnerable to being dominated if an Ace hits the board and someone else has a better Ace.\n \nI'm carefully weighing the tournament context. With a short stack and low win rate, I need to be strategic about chip preservation. Calling 32 chips feels like a calculated risk that balances my tight playing style with the need to accumulate chips. The suited nature of A5 gives me some additional equity, making this a marginally acceptable play in my current situation.\n",

Short stack, need to pick up chips or survive. Call would be 32 into pot 80, pot odds ~40% (32/(80+32)=0.285). Actually after call, pot 112, you invest 32, equity needed 28.5% to break even. 3T offsuit vs unknown range (SB, BB, and a caller). Likely not enough equity. Raise all-in? Minimum raise to 64, but you could raise all-in 213? Legal raise to at least 64, but you can go all-in if you can't meet min raise? Actually you can raise to any amount up to your stack; min raise is 64. So you could raise to 213 (all-in). That would be a shove of ~6.7 BB. With 3T, not a good shove. Might be a fold.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (Seat1 and 2) have raised various amounts in past, but here they are SB and BB. They posted blinds, not raised preflop. Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called 32 (maybe a loose caller). With short stack, maybe you could steal? But 3T is not a strong stealing hand, but maybe can steal blinds? However there are three players, SB and BB already have money in pot; you would need to raise to isolate. Raising could be a move to steal the BB? But the BB is also a player, and they may call or re-raise. With 3T, you risk being 3-bet.\n\nBetter to fold and preserve stack for better spot.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

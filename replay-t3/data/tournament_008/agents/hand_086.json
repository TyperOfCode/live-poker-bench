Let me think through the key factors:\n\n1. **My hand**: 8c Jh - This is a very weak hand, offsuit with no connectivity and low cards. This is a clear fold in almost any situation.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB (worst position post-flop)\n\n3. **Stack size**: 238 chips (7.4 BB) - This is a very short stack, in tournament danger zone\n\n4. **The raise**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 165, which is a massive overbet (more than 5x the big blind)\n\n5. **Pot odds**: There's 213 in the pot, and I need to call 149 to continue. That's about 1.43:1 pot odds, which is terrible for a hand this weak.\n\n6. **Opponent info**: Looking at the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has been quite passive - mostly folding and checking. The fact that they're making such a large raise suggests they have a very strong hand.\n\n7. **Tournament situation**: With only 7.4 BB left, I need to be very selective. This is not a hand worth risking my tournament life on.\n\n8. **The raise size**: The raise to 165 from GPT-OSS-120B is suspiciously large. Given that the BB only has 149 chips total, this raise essentially puts them all-in. This looks like a strong hand trying to isolate or protect against the short-stacked BB.\n\nThe decision is clear: FOLD. This hand is not worth 149 chips (62.6% of my stack) with J8 offsuit. I need to preserve my stack for better spots.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have Qd Jd on button, stack 165 (5.2 BB). Effective stack about 165. Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., raise 32 more). So raise to 64 would be 32 raise? Actually call is 32, raise to 64 means total bet 64, so raise amount 32. That's a 2x raise (3-bet). With 5 BB stack, we are short-stacked. QJ suited is a decent hand for push/fold. With 5 BB, typical push/fold strategy: push all-in or fold. Raising to 64 is not all-in; you could raise to 64 then maybe get called, but you risk being re-raised. Better to go all-in (165) or at least raise all-in. Minimum raise is 64, but you can raise more up to your stack. So we can raise to 165 (all-in). Legal actions include raise, so we can raise to 165.\n\nConsider opponent stacks: Seat1 238, Seat2 149. Both have decent stacks. If we push all-in, they may call with wide range. QJ suited is decent but not premium; but with 5 BB, we need to be aggressive. According to push/fold tables, with 5 BB, QJs is often a push (maybe 20%+). So we should raise all-in.\n\nThus action: raise to 165.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

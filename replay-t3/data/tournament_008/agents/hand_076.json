            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Qd Ac - This is a strong starting hand, especially in early position. Ace-Queen offsuit is definitely playable.\n\n2. **My position**: UTG (Seat 1) - This is the worst position preflop since I'm first to act. Playing from UTG requires stronger hands.\n\n3. **My stack**: 119 chips (7.4 BB) - I'm in the short stack territory. With less than 10 big blinds, I'm in push/fold territory, but I have enough chips to make a standard raise.\n\n4. **Opponents**:\n   - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (205 chips) - Recent actions show mostly folding, but did raise to 40 in hand 72\n   - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (304 chips) - Recent actions show mostly folding, called 90 in hand 69\n   - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B (188 chips) - Recent actions show mostly folding\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1) - not great immediate odds, but with a strong hand like AQ, this is a clear call or raise.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 7.4 BB, I need to be thinking about survival but also chip accumulation. AQ from UTG is strong enough to play, but I need to be careful.\n\nGiven that I'm UTG with a short stack (7.4 BB), I have a few options:\n- **Fold**: Too tight with AQ. This is a premium hand in this situation.\n- **Call**: Could be okay, but being out of position with a short stack is problematic. If I just call and miss the flop, I'm in a tough spot.\n- **Raise**: The standard play. With 7.4 BB, I should either shove all-in or make a standard raise.\n\nLooking at the raise sizing: Minimum raise is 32 (to 48 total). If I raise to 32, that would leave me with 87 chips. If I get called and miss the flop, I'll be in an awkward spot.\n\nWith 7.4 BB and AQ from UTG, the correct tournament play is often to shove all-in. This achieves several things:\n1. Maximizes fold equity\n2. Avoids difficult post-flop decisions out of position\n3. Gets maximum value when called by weaker hands\n4. Puts pressure on the bigger stacks\n\nThe opponents have been folding a lot preflop recently, so there's good fold equity. Even if I get called, AQ is in good shape against most calling ranges from the big stacks.\n\nLet me go all-in for 119 chips.",

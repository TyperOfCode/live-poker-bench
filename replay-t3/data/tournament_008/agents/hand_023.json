Tens are connected but offsuit, and the 2 is very low. This is a trash hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG, the worst position at the table. I have to act first on every street, giving me no information about what others will do.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: I should check if I have any information about the opponents. Let me search for observations to see if there's any useful information.\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: \n   - I have a decent stack of 48.2 BB, which is healthy but not huge\n   - This is a tournament, so I need to be selective with my hands, especially from early position\n   - I shouldn't risk chips with marginal hands from bad position\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: The pot is 6, I need to call 4. That's 4 to win 6, or 1.5:1 odds. But this is irrelevant with such a weak hand.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold this hand. UTG with T2 offsuit is an easy fold in any situation. I don't even need to search for opponent tendencies - this is just too weak to play from early position.\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to play this hand by searching for observations about these opponents, but I suspect this will just confirm the fold.\n\nActually, let me just fold. This is a clear fold situation. T2 offsuit from UTG is one of the worst starting hands in poker. I don't need to waste time checking opponent tendencies for this decision.",

From the data, he has been folding most hands preflop (7 out of 10 actions are folds). He called once from SB when facing a min-raise, then bet on flop. He checked once from BB when facing no action. Seems tight.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, BB) has 212 chips. Has folded 6 out of 10 times preflop, raised once (hand 19), checked once from BB. Also seems fairly tight.\n\n**My history**: I've won 4 out of 22 hands (18% win rate). Recently won hand 22 with A4o from SB by calling and betting flop with top pair.\n\n**Current situation**: I'm on BTN facing only blinds. 6-8o is a weak hand but in position against likely tight players. The pot is 6 chips, I need to call 4 chips (2.2% of my stack).\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 6-8o is weak but can make straights and occasionally two pair. Not a premium hand by any means.\n2. **Position**: Being on BTN is huge advantage - I act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Both seem tight, likely to fold to aggression unless they have strong hands.\n4. **Pot odds**: 4 to call into 10 pot (if I call) = 2.5:1 odds. Need ~28% equity to call. 6-8o vs random hands has ~35% equity, but vs tight ranges probably less.\n5. **Tournament**: I have healthy stack, can afford to see a cheap flop.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold. 6-8o is too weak even on BTN against blinds. While position is good, the hand has very little potential to improve and will be dominated often. Better to wait for better spots. The tight opponents might defend their blinds with stronger ranges than random.\n\nHowever, let me consider if I should raise as a steal attempt. Minimum raise to 8 chips (4 more). If both fold, I win 6 chips. If called, I'm out of position with a weak hand. Given opponent tightness, a raise might work, but 6-8o is a poor hand to continue with if called. I'd rather raise with better hands.\n\nFold is correct."

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this poker hand situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 6c 6s (pocket sixes) - this is a decent pocket pair\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - excellent position, last to act postflop\n3. **My stack**: 219 chips (54.8 BB) - decent stack size\n4. **Situation**: I'm facing a 2-chip call to stay in the hand (the big blind was 4, I posted 2 as small blind, so I need to call 2 more)\n\nThe current pot is 6 chips, and I need to call 2 more to see the flop. This is a very good spot for pocket sixes:\n\n- Pocket pairs are strong hands, especially from the button\n- I have good pot odds (6:2 = 3:1) to call\n- With pocket sixes, I can win big if I hit a set, or fold easily if the flop doesn't help me\n- The fact that 3 players already folded (Seats 1, 2, 3) suggests the table might be tight, which is good for me\n\nLet me think about my options:\n- **Fold**: This would be too weak with pocket sixes in this spot\n- **Call**: This is a solid option - I get to see the flop with decent pot odds\n- **Raise**: While I could raise, I need to be careful not to overcommit with a medium pocket pair\n\nGiven that I'm getting good pot odds and have position, calling seems like the best play here. I don't want to raise too much with pocket sixes preflop as they can be dominated easily, and I want to see a cheap flop to try to hit my set.\n\nI should call the 2 chips to see the flop.\n",

While there are some potential draws (spade flush, straight draws), my set is still the best hand most of the time.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom my recall of GPT-OSS-120B's recent play, they tend to be quite passive:\n- They check-called preflop in a similar situation (hand #4)\n- They've been checking with marginal hands on the flop and then folding to pressure (hands #18, #19)\n- They seem to prefer passive play rather than aggressive betting\n\n**Position and Stack Considerations:**\n- I'm in the BTN position with excellent positional advantage\n- My stack of 217 chips (54.2 BB) is healthy for tournament play\n- The opponent has checked to me, suggesting weakness\n- With no bet to call, I can take the initiative\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that I have a very strong hand (set of sixes) and the opponent has shown passive tendencies by checking, I should definitely bet for value. This is exactly the type of spot where continuation betting is appropriate. I want to:\n1. Get value from worse hands (like Ace-high, smaller pairs, etc.)\n2.

This means I've made a set of sixes, which is a very strong hand on this board. While there are some potential draws (spade flush, straight draws), my set is still the best hand most of the time.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom my recall of GPT-OSS-120B's recent play, they tend to be quite passive:\n- They check-called preflop in a similar situation (hand #4)\n- They've been checking with marginal hands on the flop and then folding to pressure (hands #18, #19)\n- They seem to prefer passive play rather than aggressive betting\n\n**Position and Stack Considerations:**\n- I'm in the BTN position with excellent positional advantage\n- My stack of 217 chips (54.2 BB) is healthy for tournament play\n- The opponent has checked to me, suggesting weakness\n- With no bet to call, I can take the initiative\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that I have a very strong hand (set of sixes) and the opponent has shown passive tendencies by checking, I should definitely bet for value. This is exactly the type of spot where continuation betting is appropriate. I want to:\n1. Get value from worse hands (like Ace-high, smaller pairs, etc.)\n2. Protect my hand against potential draws\n3. Take advantage of my position and their passive play\n\nI'll bet 6 chips (about 75% of the pot) to represent strength and extract value.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 6,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have a set of sixes on a coordinated board (8s-Ah-9s) which is a very strong hand. The opponent has shown passive tendencies by checking, and I'm in position",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Hand Strength and Potential:**\nI have pocket sixes (6c 6s), which is a solid hand preflop and has made a set on this board of 8s-Ah-9s. This is actually a very strong hand - I have a set, which is typically one of the best hands you can have on the flop. The board has some potential draws (spade flush draw, straight draws), but my set of sixes is still very strong.\n\n**Position and Stack Size:**\nI'm in the BTN (Button) position, which is excellent as I get to act last on the flop. My stack is 217 chips (54.2 BB), which is a healthy stack for tournament play.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom my recall of GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions, I can see they tend to be passive:\n- They've been checking with marginal hands on the flop (hands #18, #19)\n- They check-called preflop in hand #4 with what was likely a weaker hand\n- They seem to prefer passive play rather than aggressive betting\n\n**Pot Odds and Implied Odds:**\nThe pot is currently 8 chips, and I have no bet to call (opponent checked). This means I can either check or bet. Given my strong hand (set of sixes), I should definitely be betting for value.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWith a healthy stack and a very strong hand, this is a good spot to build the pot. I'm not at risk of elimination, so I can afford to play aggressively with this strong hand.\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe board is 8s-Ah-9s. While there are potential draws (spade flush, straights), my set of sixes is still very strong. Even if my opponent has a draw, I have the best hand right now and should be betting for value.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should definitely bet here. With a set of sixes on the flop, I want to:\n1. Get value from worse hands (like pocket pairs, Ace-high, etc.)\n2. Protect my hand against draws\n3. Take advantage of my position and the opponent's passive tendencies\n\nA reasonable bet size would be around half the pot to 2/3 pot, which would be about 4-6 chips. \n\nI'm now carefully reviewing the previous hand details, focusing on the precise actions and context. The preflop sequence shows multiple players folding, with me calling from the button and the big blind checking. The pot is now 8 chips, and the opponent has checked, presenting an opportunity for a strategic bet.\n\nMy pocket sixes have transformed into a set on the 8s-Ah-9s board, which represents a significant hand strength. Given the opponent's tendency to check and fold, I can confidently move forward with a value betting strategy. The bet size of 6 chips seems appropriate - large enough to extract value while maintaining reasonable pot control.\n",

The opponent's passive style suggests they might fold if I apply pressure, but the Ace on board complicates my decision. With medium pair and multiple board possibilities, a strategic bet could maximize my chip potential while minimizing risk.\n\nThe key is finding the right balance between aggression and caution. A modest bet around 12-15 chips could test their strength without committing too many chips if they unexpectedly have a strong hand.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation carefully:\n\n1. My hand: 6c 6s (pocket 6s)\n2. Position: BTN (Seat 4)\n3. Stack: 211 chips (52.8 BB)\n4. Blinds: 2/4\n5. Pot: 20 chips\n6. Board: 8s Ah 9s 2c\n7. Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) with 206 chips\n8. Amount to call: 0 (opponent checked)\n9. Minimum raise to: 6\n10. Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\nLet me think about my options:\n\n**Hand strength analysis:**\n- I have pocket 6s\n- Board: 8s Ah 9s 2c\n- This is a dangerous board with Ace high and potential straights (7-10 range, 10-J-Q-K range)\n- My 6s are likely behind to any hand that has an Ace, or any straight\n- However, the opponent checked to me, which could indicate weakness\n\n**Opponent analysis from the tools:**\nFrom the recall_opponent_actions, I can see GPT-OSS-120B's recent behavior:\n- Hand #19: raised preflop (6), then checked flop, turn, and river\n- Hand #18: checked flop, then folded\n- Generally seems to fold a lot preflop (hands 17, 20, 21, 22 all folds)\n- Mixed behavior on turn: sometimes bets (hands 3, 5), sometimes checks (hands 9, 19)\n\n**My recent BTN performance:**\n- Win rate from BTN: 27.3% (6 wins out of 22 hands)\n- Recent BTN hands show mixed results\n- Hand #4: won with 6c 6d (similar pocket pair) - won 24 chips\n- Generally seems to be playing reasonably from BTN\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm in position (BTN) - this is an advantage\n\n\n- Decent stack size allows for strategic maneuvering\n- Need to carefully evaluate the board's potential threats\n\n**Strategic assessment:**\n- The Ace-high board significantly weakens my 6s\n- Opponent's check suggests potential vulnerability\n- Raising could exploit their apparent weakness\n- Must balance aggressive play with risk management\n\n**Potential actions:**\n- Checking seems prudent given board dangers\n- Raising requires careful chip allocation\n- Folding might be premature with pocket 6s\n\nThe key is maintaining flexibility while protecting my chip stack against a potentially stronger opponent. I'm analyzing a strategic poker decision with pocket 6s. The key considerations involve board dynamics, opponent behavior, and chip management. Checking seems optimal given the Ace-high board and potential straight risks. My 27% BTN win rate suggests passive play is reasonable. The opponent's recent actions indicate potential weakness, but the board's complexity demands caution. With 52.8 BB, I can afford to see the river without significant risk, making a check the most prudent move to control pot size and gather more information.",

This means I need about 25% equity to make a profitable call. Against GPT-OSS-120B's likely range (which based on their history seems to include some decent hands but isn't overly aggressive), pocket sixes should have reasonable equity.\n\nThe board has some potential draws (spades, straight possibilities) but doesn't directly threaten my pair. I'm in position, which is valuable. My stack is healthy enough that I can make this call without putting myself in danger.\n\nI think calling is the best play here.

Actually SB posted 2 (half blind?) Wait blinds are 2/4, so SB is 2, BB is 4. SB posted 2, then SB call 2? That seems they called the BB? Actually after posting SB, they can raise or check. The action shows \"Seat 4 post_sb 2\" then \"Seat 5 post_bb 4\". Then \"Seat 1 fold\", etc. Then \"Seat 4 call 2\". That means SB is checking? Actually call 2 means they call the BB's 4? No, they'd need to call 2 more to match BB's 4. So they call 2, making pot 8 (2+4+2). So we are in BB with amount to call 0 (since SB just called). So we can check or raise. Hand 7s8h is suited connectors, decent for stealing? In BB, after SB just called, it's a limp. We are out of position after flop (SB first). With 7-8 suited, could consider a raise to isolate. Stack 53 BB, can raise to 8 min, which is 2BB. That's a small raise, but could be okay. However SB just limped, likely weak. Raising could win pot now or set up flop. 7-8 suited is a decent hand for limping or raising? In early tournament, with 53 BB, maybe raise to 12-15? Minimum raise is 8. Raising to 8 is small, may get re-raised? But SB already called, they'd need to re-raise. Could also just check and see flop. But 7-8 suited is a speculative hand; playing postflop from out of position is tricky. However with 53 BB, we can afford to see flop cheap. The pot is 8, we can see flop for free if check. If flop hits, we have potential draws. I'd likely check to see flop and then decide. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We'll check.\n\nProvide JSON.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have flop: board 8s Ah 9s. Our hand: 7s 8h. So we have pair of eights (top pair? Actually board has 8s and 9s and Ace. Our 8h gives us a pair of eights, plus a flush draw (spades: we have 7s, board has 8s and 9s spades, need two more spades for flush). Also we have open-ended straight draw? Cards: 7,8,9 on board, we have 7 and 8, so we have 7-8-9, need 6 or 10 for straight. We have 7,8 so we have gutshot? Actually we have 7 and 8, board 8, A,9. So we have 7-8-8-9-A. Straight possibilities: need 6 for 6-7-8-9-10? No 10 not present. Need 10 for 8-9-10-J-Q? Not. So we have open-ended? Not. We have a gutshot for 6-7-8-9-10 missing 6 or 10, but 10 not on board. So need 6 or 10. Not strong.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 bet 6 into pot 14 (so pot now 20). We are in BB with 212 chips. We have decent equity: we have pair, flush draw (2 outs to flush? Actually we have 7s, board has 8s,9s. So we have two spades on board? Wait board: 8s Ah 9s. That's two spades (8s,9s). We have 7s. So we have three spades total, need one more spade for flush. So 9 outs (13 spades left minus 3 known = 10? Actually spades in deck 13, we see 8s,9s,7s = 3, so 10 outs). Also we have a gutshot for straight (6 or 10). So total outs maybe 12 (excluding Aces and other combos). So equity ~ 12 outs on turn+river ~ about 24% maybe.\n\nPot odds: call 6 to win pot 20+6 = 26? Actually pot before call is 20 (14+6). To call 6 you get pot 20+6=26. So pot odds 6/26 = 23% required. Our equity maybe ~24% so borderline call. Also we have implied odds maybe if we hit flush we can win more chips. Opponent's stack: MiniMax-M2 has 211 chips, similar. So we could win about 200 chips. So implied odds good.\n\nWe could also consider raising. Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise total to 12). That would be raise of 6 more (total 12). That would be a semi-bluff maybe. Does opponent have tendency? Past recall shows only one flop bet of 3 in hand 18. Not much data.\n\nGiven we have decent equity and pot odds just barely favorable, calling is reasonable. Raising could be risky as we may be behind if opponent has Ace or 9 or pair. But we have top pair? Actually board Ace, we have pair of eights, opponent could have Ace high, or 9, or 8, or straight draws. Raising might isolate.\n\nI think call.\n\nThus JSON: action call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Actually board has 8s, we have 7s 8h, so we have top pair? Board: 8s (spade), Ah, 9s, 2c, 6h. Our 8h pairs with board 8s => pair of eights. Also we have a straight draw? Board: A, 9, 8, 6, 2. Our 7 gives us 6-7-8-9 straight? Actually we have 6 on board, 7 in hand, 8 on board, 9 on board => that's a straight 6-7-8-9-10? No, need 10 for that. 5-6-7-8-9 would be straight, we have 5? No. So we have no straight. We have flush draw? Board has two spades (8s, 9s). Our 7s is spade, gives three spades. Not a flush. So our hand is just a pair of eights, which is second pair behind Ace high. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 24 on river. Let's consider opponent's range.\n\nPreflop: opponent (Seat 4) posted small blind 2, then called 2 (big blind) preflop. So they have a wide range, likely any two cards.\n\nFlop: board 8s Ah 9s. Opponent bet 6 into pot 12? Pot after preflop: we had 4 (bb) + 2 (sb) + call 2 = 8? Actually preflop: SB 2, BB 4, others folded, SB called 2, BB checked. So pot 8. Flop bet 6, we called 6, pot 20. Flop board: 8s Ah 9s. Opponent bet 6 (small). Could be many hands: top pair Aces, middle pair 9s, 8s, draws, etc.\n\nTurn: board 2c, turn bet 12 by us (BB) after opponent checked. So we bet 12 into pot 20 (after flop). We have 8 pair, maybe we think we are ahead of many draws? Opponent called 12.\n\nRiver: board 6h. Opponent bets 24 into pot (68). So pot after turn: pre-turn pot 20 + our bet 12 + call 12 = 44. River bet 24, pot 68 (makes sense). Opponent's bet 24 is about 35% of pot.\n\nOur hand: 8 pair, but opponent could have Ace (A? with kicker), could have 9, could have 8 (set?), could have straight draws that missed, could have flush draws. Let's consider opponent's possible holdings.\n\nGiven they called our turn bet 12, they might have a hand that wants to see river. Could be Ace, could be 9, could be 8, could be draws.\n\nNow river board: 6h. Does any new hand appear? Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9 would be a straight if opponent has 5. They don't have 5 (unknown). 6-7-8-9-10 would need 10. Not present. So only possible new hand is maybe a pair of 6s (if they have 6). Could be a flush? No spade flush, need 2 spades, we have 7s, board has 8s,9s. That's only 3 spades, need 5. Not possible. So river adds little.\n\nThus opponent's bet likely is value bet with Ace, maybe 9, maybe 8 (set? Actually set of 8s would be 8-8-8, but board has one 8, we have 8h, opponent could have 8x, making trips. That's strong). Could be a bluff? Possibly, but not many draws left.\n\nOur hand is just a pair of eights, which is likely behind Ace (A? ), behind 9, behind 8 trips, behind any two pair like A8? Actually board has Ace and 8, we have 8, so we have two pair? No, board has Ace high, we have pair of eights, not two pair. Opponent could have Ace with any kicker, giving top pair Ace, which beats us. Also could have 9 for pair of 9s, which beats us. Could have 8 for set (trips). Could have 6 for pair of six"

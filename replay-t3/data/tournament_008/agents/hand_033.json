K4s is not a strong starting hand, especially from UTG position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. I need a very strong hand to play from this position.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 137 chips (34.2 BB), which is a decent stack but not deep enough to take unnecessary risks.\n\n4. **Opponents**: I have no reads on them yet since this appears to be the first hand.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: From UTG with a weak hand like K4s, the standard play is to fold. This hand has poor equity against calling ranges and is dominated by many hands that could call or raise behind me.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I would need to call 4 chips to win 6, which is 1.5:1 odds. But this doesn't matter much with such a weak hand from poor position.\n\nThe correct play here is to fold. K4s from UTG is a clear fold in almost all situations, especially without any reads on opponents that would suggest they're playing very loose/passive.",

This is a decent position to play from.\n\n**Stack:** 157 chips (39.2 BB) - healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): SB with 219 chips. From the history, they raised once from SB (hand #29) to 12, and otherwise mostly folded or checked. They seem somewhat tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): BB with 278 chips. They've folded a lot preflop recently (7 of last 8 hands). They seem very tight preflop.\n\n**Action:** Both early positions folded, SB posted 2, BB posted 4. Action is on me.\n\n**Hand strength:** KTo offsuit is a marginal hand. It's playable from the button, but not super strong. The T (ten) is a bit weak.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Conservative play given marginal hand\n2. **Call:** See a cheap flop with position\n3. **Raise:** Take initiative with position\n\n**Considerations:**\n- SB has shown some aggression (raised once from SB)\n- BB has been folding a lot\n- I have position advantage postflop\n- Pot is 6 chips, call is 4 chips (2.5% of my stack)\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 39BB, I'm not in push/fold territory. I can afford to play some speculative hands.\n\nGiven that BB has been folding a lot and I have position, I think raising could be good to try to take the pot preflop or get heads-up with position. However, KTo is not a great hand to raise with from the button - it's better to raise with stronger hands.\n\nCalling seems reasonable - it's cheap, I have position, and I can see a flop. If I hit a King or Ten, I can continue. If not, I can fold.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent tendencies: BB has folded to a lot of preflop raises recently. A raise might take it down immediately. But if called, I'm out of position against the SB or BB.\n\nWait, I'm on the button - I have position on both blinds. That's good.\n\nLet me think about sizing: Minimum raise is to 8 (double the BB). That's 4 more chips than calling. If I raise to 8, SB would need to call 6 more (from 2 to 8), BB would need to call 4 more (from 4 to 8).\n\nActually, I think calling is the best play here. KTo is a decent hand to see a flop with position, but not strong enough to raise for value. If I raise and get called, I'm building a bigger pot with a marginal hand.\n\nBetter to call, see a flop, and use my position advantage postflop. If I hit something, I can bet. If not, I can check/fold.\n\nI'll call."

The board is 7c Th Ac 4c. This is a decent but vulnerable hand. The Ac on board means I don't have top pair with Ace, which is good for me since my kicker is King. However, the flush draw is now present with two clubs.\n\n2. **Opponent's range**: BB checked preflop, called my flop bet, and now checks turn. They could have:\n   - A weaker Ten (T9, T8, etc.)\n   - A draw (flush draw with clubs, straight draws)\n   - A weak Ace (A7, A4, etc.)\n   - A slow-played strong hand (AT, A7, maybe even 77 for set)\n\n3. **Turn decision**: I have position and initiative. The pot is 22 chips. My options:\n   - **Check**: Take a free card, but gives opponent free river if they're on a draw\n   - **Bet**: Continue aggression, charge draws, get value from weaker Tens\n\n4. **Bet sizing considerations**: \n   - Small bet (6-8 chips): Gets called by draws and weaker hands, builds pot\n   - Medium bet (10-12 chips): More pressure on draws, still gets value\n   - Large bet (14+ chips): Puts serious pressure, may fold out weaker hands\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 147 chips (36.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. Opponent has 272 chips. I should play cautiously but also look for value.\n\n**Decision**: I think I should bet for value. I have top pair with a decent kicker, and many draws are available (flush draw, straight draws). A bet of 10-12 chips seems reasonable - about half pot. This charges draws while still getting value from weaker Tens.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious about the flush draw. If I bet and get raised, I might be in trouble. But given opponent's checking pattern, they're likely weak or drawing.\n\nLet me bet 12 chips (about 55% of pot). This puts pressure on draws while getting value from weaker holdings. If raised, I can re-evaluate based on sizing."

I need to specify \"raise_to\" as the total amount I'm putting in. If I want to bet 12 chips, that means I'm raising to 12 total (since I have 0 in so far). Actually wait - I need to be careful. The minimum raise to is 6. That means I need to put in at least 6 more than whatever the current bet is. Since it's checked to me and amount to call is 0, I think I can bet any amount from 6 to my entire stack.\n\nActually, in poker terminology: when facing a check and I want to bet, I use \"raise\" with \"raise_to\" being the amount I want to put in total. Since there's no bet to call, I'm essentially making a new bet. So if I want to bet 12 chips, I'd set \"raise_to\": 12.\n\nBut let me double-check: The \"minimum raise to: 6\" suggests that if I want to raise, I need to make it at least 6 total. That seems low - maybe it means I need to raise by at least 6 more than the current bet? But current bet is 0... Actually in no-limit, when checked to, you can bet any amount from the minimum bet (usually the big blind) up to your stack. The minimum bet is usually the big blind (4 chips). But it says \"minimum raise to: 6\" which is confusing.\n\nActually, I think \"minimum raise to: 6\" means that if I want to raise (bet), the minimum total amount I can put in is 6 chips. That makes sense: big blind is 4, so minimum bet would be 4, but maybe because previous street had betting, the minimum is 6? Or maybe it's a tournament rule.\n\nAnyway, I want to bet around 12 chips. That's above the minimum of 6. So I'll use \"raise\" with \"raise_to\": 12.\n\nReasoning: I have top pair with King kicker, should bet for value against draws and weaker Tens. Bet of 12 chips (55% pot) charges draws appropriately while building pot.\n\nLet me output JSON.",

Looking at their recent history:\n   - They've been folding a lot (8 out of 10 recent hands)\n   - They called 8 chips once (hand 26) and 2 chips once (hand 27) \n   - They showed down once with 3h Qh and lost\n   - This suggests they might be playing tight/passive\n\n4. **Stack Considerations**: \n   - My stack: 219 chips (54.8 BB) - middle stack\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2: 153 chips - shorter stack than mine\n   - GPT-OSS-120B: 278 chips - biggest stack\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 2 chips to see a flop. The pot will be 10 chips after my call, giving me 5:1 pot odds.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: This is early in a tournament (hand #33), so I should be careful with weak hands. However, the pot odds are very good for a cheap look at the flop.\n\n7. **Hand Strength**: 9c 5h is very weak. Even if I hit something, I might be dominated. The only real value would be hitting a straight or two pair, which is unlikely.\n\nGiven the very weak hand, tight opponent who might fold to pressure, and the fact that I'm out of position, I should fold this hand.

We could check and see flop cheap. But we are out of position post-flop (SB is out, only opponent). Actually we are BB, opponent is in UTG (they are in early position but after flop they will be first to act preflop? In heads-up, the dealer is SB? In heads-up, the dealer posts small blind and acts first preflop. But we are BB, seat5, so seat3 is in the big blind? Wait confusion. In heads-up, the dealer is SB and acts first preflop, then BB acts second. But we have SB posted by seat4, but seat4 folded. So we are BB vs UTG who called. So after preflop, the action on flop will be to the caller (seat3) first, then us (BB). So we are out of position. With 6c9h, it's a weak hand, likely fold. But we already posted BB. The amount to call is 0, we can check. Should we check? If we check, we see flop cheap, could see a cheap flop. But 6c9h is a speculative hand with limited potential. In tournament with 69.5 BB, preserving stack is important. Against a single opponent who called from early position (tight?), we might want to fold if we think they have a better hand. But checking is safe: we see flop for free. Could be okay.\n\nCheck vs raise? We can raise to 8 minimum. Raising with 6c9h is not advisable. So check.\n\nThus action: check, raise_to null.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Board: 7c Th Ac. Our hand 6c 9h. So we have gutshot straight draw? Actually board has 7,10,A. Our hole cards 6 and 9 give us an open-ended straight draw? Let's see possible straights: 6-7-8-9-10 would be straight if we have 8, but we have 6 and 9, board has 7,10. So we have 6-7-8-9-10 missing 8. Also 9-10-J-Q-K? Not. So we have gutshot: need 8 to complete 6-7-8-9-10. Also we have backdoor flush draw? We have 6c and board has 7c, so one club on board, we have club, need two more clubs on turn and river for flush. Not strong.\n\nWe have no pair. So currently just gutshot and backdoor flush. Not much.\n\nOpponent seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) called preflop 4 (small blind). So they have some hand, maybe decent. On flop, they haven't acted yet (they are the only opponent left). It's their turn after us? Actually order: SB folded, BB checked, then UTG? Actually seat 3 is UTG? But they are after BB? Preflop they called. Now flop, action goes to seat 3 first (since they are earlier in order?). Usually after flop, first active player left of button? In BB, the flop action starts with first player left of button (SB) if still in. SB folded, so next is seat 3 (UTG). So they act first. So we are after them. So we have amount to call 0, meaning they have checked? Actually we don't know their action yet. The state shows amount to call 0, meaning it's our turn and no bet yet. So they must have checked. So we can check or raise.\n\nGiven weak hand, we should probably check. Raise would be a bluff. Could be okay if we think they are weak. But we have limited stack 278, pot 10, raising to minimum 4 (i.e., raise to 4 total? Actually raise to total amount 4? Minimum raise to 4 meaning raise amount? Usually min raise is 4, meaning you put total 4? But we already have 0 to call, so raising to 4 puts 4 chips in. That's small.\n\nGiven we have a gutshot, maybe we can try to semi-bluff raise to apply pressure. Opponent's stack 153, they could fold many hands. However tournament considerations: we have decent stack (69 BB) and opponent 153 (38 BB). We could try to steal pot. But risk: if they call, we are left with a weak draw. Pot odds: If we raise 4, pot becomes 14, they call 4, pot 18, we have 2 outs (8). Actually we have 4 outs? Straight draw: need 8. There are four 8s, but one may be on board? No 8 on board. So 4 outs. Also flush draw: need two clubs, but only one more club needed for flush? Actually we have 6c, board has 7c, need two more clubs for flush, so need two clubs on turn and river, not immediate. So only straight outs 4. Chance to hit on turn or river about 8% (4/47 + 4/46). So not great. So a raise may be unprofitable if called.\n\nBetter to check and see turn. So action: check.\n\nThus JSON.",

Let's see: possible straight combos: 8-9-10-J-Q? Not relevant. With 6-9 we have 6-7-8-9-10? We need 8 to complete 6-7-8-9-10 straight. That's a gutshot (need 8). Also we have backdoor flush draws? We have clubs 6c, board has 7c, Ac. That's two clubs, we have one club, need two more clubs. Not strong.\n\nWe have Ace high, but board has Ace, so we have pair of Aces (board). Our hand does not improve; we have Ace high (kicker 9). Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 6 into pot 16, so pot will be 22 after call. Pot odds: need to call 6 to win 22 (including call) = 6/(22) = ~27% needed. Our equity with gutshot? With 8 outs (four 8s) plus maybe some combos for runner-runner flush? But primary outs: 8 outs for straight. Also two clubs? Actually we have 6c, board clubs: 7c, Ac. So we have a flush draw? Need two more clubs, but we only have one club, need two clubs on turn and river. That's not immediate. So outs maybe 8. Probability to hit on turn or river: about 15% (8/47 \u224817% for turn, plus if miss then 8/46 \u224817% for river, combined ~30%). So equity maybe ~30% against a single opponent's bet. Pot odds 27% so call is marginally profitable. Consider opponent's tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 flop bet amounts 8 and 5 in previous hands. Those are small bets relative to pot. Could be continuation bet with weak hand, maybe they have Ace or something. Our hand is weak. Could also consider raising? Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise to 12 total). That would be 6 more. Not much. Raising could be a bluff? But we have little equity if called. Could raise to try to take pot now, but likely opponent will call with Ace or better.\n\nGiven stack depth 278, we can afford call. I think call is correct.\n\nThus action: call.",

Board: 7,10,A. So we have gutshot? 6-7-8-9-10 would be straight, missing 8. So we have 6 and 9, we have 6-7-8-9-10 straight draw needs 8. Not present. Also we have pair? No. So we have just 6-high, no pair. The board has Ace high. We have backdoor flush? We have club 6c, so we have four clubs? Actually we have 6c, board clubs: 7c, Ac, 4c = three clubs. So we have four clubs total (6c + three board) = four clubs, we have a flush draw (needs any club). So we have a nut flush draw? The Ace of clubs is on board, so the nut flush is Ace-high flush, but we have 6c, so we would have 6-high flush if hits, but Ace is on board, so any club would give us a flush with Ace high? Actually flush ranking: highest card determines. Since board has Ace of clubs, any flush will have Ace high, regardless of our club. So we cannot make a higher flush than board; but board already has Ace, so any club on turn/river will give everyone a flush with Ace high. So we have a flush draw but not the nut? Actually it's the nut flush because the Ace is on board, so the best possible flush is Ace-high, which is already on board; we cannot have a higher flush than board; but if a club hits, the board will have four clubs including Ace, making the best hand a flush with Ace high; all players with a club will share same flush; but we could have a higher kicker? Flush ranking uses highest cards in hand beyond board? For flush, you consider the best five clubs. If board has Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten clubs, that's straight flush; but here board only has Ace, 7, 4 clubs. If a club hits, we will have five clubs: Ace, 7, 4, 6, X. Our kicker is 6. If opponent has Kc, they'd have Ace, K, 7, 4, X (maybe). So we could be outdrawn. So it's not the nut flush.\n\nWe are on turn. The pot is 22. Opponent (Seat 3) DeepSeek-V3.2 bet? Actually actions: flop: seat3 bet 6, seat5 call 6. So after flop, pot 22? Wait preflop pot: 2+4+4 =10? Actually preflop: SB 2, BB 4, call 4 by seat3, so pot 2+4+4 =10. Flop: seat5 check, seat3 bet 6, seat5 call 6. So pot now: 10+6+6 =22. Yes.\n\nNow turn: board adds a card (unknown from description). Actually we have turn card not shown. Wait board: 7c Th Ac 4c. That's 4 cards, so turn is 4c. So turn card is 4c (club). So board now: clubs: 7c, Ac, 4c. So we have flush draw now 4 clubs.\n\nNow it's our turn? Actually after flop, seat3 bet 6, we called. Now turn action: Who acts first? Usually the player left of dealer (SB) acts first preflop, then after flop, the first active player left of dealer acts first. Seat 3 is DeepSeek, seat5 is us. Who is seat? Seats: seat1 Kimi, seat2 Kimi, seat3 DeepSeek, seat4 MiniMax folded, seat5 us. Dealer? Not given. But we are BB, seat5. The SB is seat4 (post_sb 2) but folded preflop. So after flop, the first active player left of dealer? If dealer is seat? Not given. But actions show flop: seat5 check first, then seat3 bet. So seat5 acted first on flop. So on turn, seat5 acts first again? Likely yes. So now it's our turn on turn, amount to call is 0 (since no bet yet). Minimum raise to 6 (pot 22? Actually minimum raise is size of previous bet? Usually it's at least the size of the bet on that street, which was 6. So raise to 6? Actually raise to at least pot? The minimum raise is previous bet amount plus"

Who is seat? Seats: seat1 Kimi, seat2 Kimi, seat3 DeepSeek, seat4 MiniMax folded, seat5 us. Dealer? Not given. But we are BB, seat5. The SB is seat4 (post_sb 2) but folded preflop. So after flop, the first active player left of dealer? If dealer is seat? Not given. But actions show flop: seat5 check first, then seat3 bet. So seat5 acted first on flop. So on turn, seat5 acts first again? Likely yes. So now it's our turn on turn, amount to call is 0 (since no bet yet). Minimum raise to 6 (pot 22? Actually minimum raise is size of previous bet? Usually it's at least the size of the bet on that street, which was 6. So raise to 6? Actually raise to at least pot? The minimum raise is previous bet amount plus",

            "reasoning_content": "Need to decide action. We have a flush draw with 4 clubs, plus maybe straight draw? 6c 9h gives open-ended? Not open. So about 9 outs for flush (13 clubs total, we have 1, board 3, so remaining 9). Also maybe a gutshot 8 for straight (needs 8). That's 4 outs (four 8s). Some overlap with clubs (8c counted already). So total outs approx 12? Actually 8c is both flush and straight, but that's fine. So about 12 outs. Turn to river: two cards left. Approx equity ~ 12*2/47 = ~51%? Actually using approximate: 12 outs, chance to hit by river = 1 - ( (39/47)*(38/46) ) = about 1 - (0.8298*0.8261) = 1 - 0.685 = 0.315. So ~31% chance to improve. Not great.\n\nOpponent just called our flop call, so they likely have something like Ace high, maybe pair, maybe draw. Their bet on flop was 6 into pot 10 (post-flop pot 10). That's a small bet, maybe they have a hand like Ace, or a draw, or a weak pair. They called our call, indicating they are okay.\n\nNow turn: board 4c adds another club, giving opponent also a club draw? They may have clubs. They might have Aces. Our hand is weak. We have 272 chips, stack decent. Pot 22. No bet yet. We can check or bet/raise. Considering our equity ~31% and pot odds if they bet. If we bet, we could represent a strong hand (maybe Ace). But we have no pair. Might be okay to check and see river. If we check, opponent may bet; we can decide then.\n\nCheck is legal (amount to call 0). Raising is also legal but we need raise_to at least 6 (minimum raise). Should we raise? Probably not, as we have weak hand.\n\nThus choose \"check\".",

We have 6c, so we have two clubs on board (7c, Ac, 4c) actually three clubs? Wait board: 7c, Th, Ac, 4c. That's three clubs: 7c, Ac, 4c. Our hand has 6c, so we have four clubs total, need one more club for flush. So we have a flush draw (any club). Also straight possibilities: board has A, T, 7, 4. Our hand 6,9 gives possible straight draw? We have 6,9. Combine with board: 4-5-6-7-8? Not there. Could get 8? Not. 9-10-J-Q-K? Not. So only flush draw.\n\nOpponent (Seat 3) DeepSeek-V3.2 bet 12 on turn after we checked. Preflop they called 4 (so they have something). Flop they bet 6, we called. So they are showing aggression.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: Opponent has 135 chips left. Pot currently 34 + 6 (flop bet) + 6 call = 46? Wait pot after flop: Preflop pot: 4 (bb) + 4 (call) = 8? Actually preflop: seat5 posted bb 4, seat3 called 4 => pot 8. Flop: seat5 check, seat3 bet 6, seat5 call 6 => pot adds 12, total pot 20. Turn: seat5 check, seat3 bet 12 => pot will be 32 after call. So currently pot before turn bet: 20. Opponent bets 12, making pot 32 if called.\n\nOur stack: 272, opponent 135. So we have deep stack.\n\nWe need to decide: call, raise, or fold. We have a flush draw with 4 outs? Actually clubs left: clubs in deck: 13 total, board has 3 clubs, we have 1 club = 4 clubs accounted. Remaining clubs = 9. But one of those clubs is the Ace? Already on board. So we have 9 clubs left. However some may be dead (opponent may hold clubs). So approximate outs = 9. Turn to river: we have one card to hit. Probability ~ 9/46 = 19.6% chance to hit on river.\n\nPot odds: To call 12 to win pot of 32 (including opponent's bet). Actually pot after call will be 20 + 12*2 = 44? Let's compute: pot before turn bet = 20. Opponent bets 12, we call 12, pot becomes 44. So we call 12 to potentially win 44. Pot odds = 12/44 = 27.3% required. Our equity ~ 20% (if just flush draw). Not enough. However we also have straight possibilities? Not. So call is negative expected value.\n\nWe could raise to make them fold if they are weak. But they are betting again, maybe they have a strong hand (maybe Ace high, pair, etc). They may have Ace (board has Ace). Could be top pair Ace, etc. Our flush draw is not strong enough to raise.\n\nWe could fold. That preserves chips. Since we are deep stack, folding is reasonable.\n\nConsider tournament: we have 68 BB, comfortable.\n\nThus best action: fold.\n\nWe need to output JSON with action \"fold\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

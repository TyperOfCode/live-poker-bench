It plays well in multiway pots when you can hit a set, but is vulnerable otherwise.\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB with good postflop position against SB and the caller.\n3. **Pot odds**: There's 6 chips in the pot and it costs me 0 to check, so checking is free.\n4. **Opponents**: MiniMax-M2 appears very tight, folding all 3 previous hands preflop. GPT-OSS-120B seems more active. This suggests the field might be relatively weak.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 99 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks, but seeing a free flop with pocket pairs is generally +EV, especially in position.\n\n**Decision**: I should check here. Raising with pocket fours from BB against two callers is not advisable because:\n- If I raise and get called, I'm likely up against stronger hands\n- Pocket fours don't play well when you don't hit a set\n- I can see a free flop and only continue if I hit my set or the board is very favorable\n- The opponents don't seem overly aggressive based on limited history\n\nChecking allows me to see the flop for free and preserves my stack while maintaining good position.",

The dry board limits potential draws, suggesting opponents likely missed. A modest bet around 4-5 chips could effectively pressure opponents with marginal hands. Checking risks giving free cards to potentially stronger holdings, so a carefully sized bet appears most advantageous.",

          "content": "  The user is asking me to make a decision in a poker hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand Situation:**\n- Position: BB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: 4d 4h (pocket 4s)\n- Stack: 193 chips (96.5 BB)\n- Board: 9h 5d 3c 7d\n- Pot: 16 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Action History:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) called 2, GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) called 1 (small blind), I checked\n- Flop: GPT-OSS-120B checked, I bet 5, MiniMax-M2 called, GPT-OSS-120B folded\n- Turn: It's on me to act\n\n**Current Board Analysis:**\nThe board is 9h 5d 3c 7d. This gives me:\n- No made hand - just pocket 4s\n- No flush draw (I don't have diamonds)\n- No straight draw currently (I would need a 6 for a straight)\n\nHowever, looking at the board: 9-5-3-7. If a 6 comes on the river, I would have a straight (3-4-5-6-7). So I have an open-ended straight draw (need a 6).\n\n**Opponent Information:**\nI just called the function to get MiniMax-M2's actions. The result shows:\n- Hand 1: preflop fold\n- Hand 2: preflop fold\n- Hand 3: preflop fold\n\nSo in the first 3 hands, MiniMax-M2 folded preflop every time. This is the first time they've reached the flop/turn.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 16 chips\n- I can check for free\n- If I bet, minimum raise is 5 (this is a bit confusing - usually minimum raise would be 10 if the previous bet was 5, but they're saying minimum raise to 5)\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Very weak currently - just pocket 4s with no pair. But I have an open-ended straight draw (8 outs - four 6s and four 2s? Wait, let me recalculate).\n\nActually, for a straight: 3-4-5-6-7 would be a straight. I have 4-4. So I need a 6. That's 4 outs. I also could hit a 4 for a set (2 outs). So total outs = 6.\n\nWait, let me think again about the straight possibility. The board is 9-5-3-7. For a straight with my 4:\n- 2-3-4-5-6? No, that would be 2-3-4-5-6 but the board has 7 not 6.\n- 3-4-5-6-7? Yes! If a 6 comes, I have 3-4-5-6-7.\n\nI have 4 outs to the straight (four 6s) and 2 outs to a set (two more 4s). Total 6 outs.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position (BB) against MiniMax-M2\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight so far - folded first 3 hands preflop. This is their first time seeing a flop, and they called my flop bet.\n4. **Pot Odds**: If I check, I see a free card. If I bet, I risk more chips.\n5. **Stack**: I have a healthy stack of 193 chips.\n\n**Opponent's Range**:\nSince MiniMax-M2 has been very tight (folding 3 hands preflop) but called preflop this time and called my flop bet, they likely have:\n- A decent hand like top pair (9x, 5x, 3x)\n- A straight draw (they could have 6x for the same straight draw)\n- Two pair or a set\n- Possibly a flush draw if they have diamonds\n\nWhen they called my flop bet on a board of 9-5-3, they could have:\n- Any 9 (top pair)\n- Any 5 or 3 (middle/bottom pair)\n- A straight draw with 6-7 or 6-4 or 6-2\n- Overcards\n- A flush draw with two diamonds\n\n**My Decision**:\nI have a weak hand with some outs (6 outs = ~12% chance to improve on river). I'm out of position. The opponent has shown strength by calling my flop bet. I should check and see a free card. There's no value in betting here because:\n- Better hands will call or raise\n- Worse hands will"

I also could hit a 4 for a set (2 outs). So total outs = 6.\n\nWait, let me think again about the straight possibility. The board is 9-5-3-7. For a straight with my 4:\n- 2-3-4-5-6? No, that would be 2-3-4-5-6 but the board has 7 not 6.\n- 3-4-5-6-7? Yes! If a 6 comes, I have 3-4-5-6-7.\n\nI have 4 outs to the straight (four 6s) and 2 outs to a set (two more 4s). Total 6 outs.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position (BB) against MiniMax-M2\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight so far - folded first 3 hands preflop. This is their first time seeing a flop, and they called my flop bet.\n4. **Pot Odds**: If I check, I see a free card. If I bet, I risk more chips.\n5. **Stack**: I have a healthy stack of 193 chips.\n\n**Opponent's Range**:\nSince MiniMax-M2 has been very tight (folding 3 hands preflop) but called preflop this time and called my flop bet, they likely have:\n- A decent hand like top pair (9x, 5x, 3x)\n- A straight draw (they could have 6x for the same straight draw)\n- Two pair or a set\n- Possibly a flush draw if they have diamonds\n\nWhen they called my flop bet on a board of 9-5-3, they could have:\n- Any 9 (top pair)\n- Any 5 or 3 (middle/bottom pair)\n- A straight draw with 6-7 or 6-4 or 6-2\n- Overcards\n- A flush draw with two diamonds\n\n**My Decision**:\nI have a weak hand with some outs (6 outs = ~12% chance to improve on river). I'm out of position. The opponent has shown strength by calling my flop bet. I should check and see a free card. There's no value in betting here because:\n- Better hands will call or raise\n- Worse hands will",

I have 6 outs. The pot is 16 chips. \n\nOptions:\n1. **Check**: See a free card, preserve chips. This is the conservative play.\n2. **Bet**: Try to get opponent to fold better hands or build pot if I hit.

Even getting 5:1 pot odds (calling 1 to win 5), it's not worth it because:\n1. The hand has almost no post-flop playability\n2. I'll be out of position\n3.

It's unconnected, unsuited, and low. This is a clear fold in almost any situation.\n2. **Position**: Being UTG means I'll be first to act on every street, putting me at a significant disadvantage. I need a very strong hand to play from this position.\n3. **Action so far**: Small blind and big blind posted, one player folded. I need to call 2 chips to see the flop.\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 3 chips and I need to call 2 chips, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not relevant since my hand is so weak.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: While I have a healthy stack, there's no need to risk chips with such a weak hand from bad position.\n\n**No need to check opponent history** - this is such a clear fold that opponent tendencies don't matter. 2-7 offsuit UTG is a fold 100% of the time against any opponents.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a trivial fold. Playing 2-7 offsuit from UTG would be a massive mistake that would bleed chips over time.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 8d 6h - This is a weak, offsuit, non-connected hand. Very low playability.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. However, we're still preflop.\n\n3. **Stack**: 193 chips (96.5 BB) - Healthy stack, no immediate pressure.\n\n4. **Action so far**: \n   - SB posted 1 chip\n   - I posted BB 2 chips\n   - Everyone else folded\n   - SB (GPT-OSS-120B) called the additional 1 chip\n\n5. **Pot**: 4 chips (2 from me, 1 from SB, 1 from SB's call)\n\n6. **Current situation**: I can check (free flop) or raise. Amount to call is 0.\n\n7. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data on GPT-OSS-120B:\n   - They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 1, 2, 6, 7, 8)\n   - When they do play, they tend to call rather than raise (hands 3, 4, 5)\n   - In hand 3, they called preflop, then bet aggressively postflop (15, 30)\n   - In hand 4, they called preflop, checked flop, then folded\n   - In hand 5, they called preflop, then bet small on flop (2) and turn (8)\n\nThis suggests they're a relatively passive player who calls with marginal hands and sometimes bets postflop, but not always.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- My hand 8d 6h is very weak\n- However, I'm getting a free flop since SB just called\n- Pot is 4 chips, I have 193 chips\n- Position advantage on the Button\n- The opponent seems passive\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Check**: See a free flop with a weak hand. Risk: Could hit something but still be dominated. \n2. **Raise**: Try to take down the 4-chip pot immediately. Risk: Could get called and be out of position postflop with a weak hand.\n\nGiven that:\n- My hand is very weak\n- The pot is small (4 chips)\n- I have position\n- The opponent is passive and might fold to a raise\n\nI think checking is the better option. The hand isn't strong enough to raise for value, and while a bluff raise could work, the pot is so small it's not worth the risk. Checking gives me a free chance to hit a miracle flop (two pair, trips, straight, flush draw) while risking nothing.\n\nIf I hit something strong on the flop, I can extract value from this passive player. If I miss, I can easily fold.\n\nThe only argument for raising would be to try to steal the 4-chip pot, but with such a weak hand and a passive opponent who already called 1 chip, they're likely to call a small raise with any decent hand.\n\n**Decision**: Check",

I have bottom pair with a weak kicker.\n\n**Board texture:**\n- 4s Td 8s 3s - This is a very coordinated board with 3 spades (flush draw) and possible straight draws.\n- The Td is a high card that could easily connect with opponent's range.\n- There are many possible straight draws (5-7, 5-6, 6-7, 7-9, etc.)\n- The flush draw is very dangerous.\n\n**Opponent information:**\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is the only active opponent\n- They posted SB and called preflop\n- They checked on flop and turn\n- Their stack: 225 chips\n\nPreflop action:\n- Seat 5 posted SB (1 chip)\n- I posted BB (2 chips)\n- Seat 5 called 1 (so they put in 2 total, completing the BB)\n- I checked\n\nThis suggests Seat 5 has a wide range. They could have:\n- Any two cards that want to see a cheap flop\n- Small pairs\n- Suited connectors\n- Weak broadway cards\n- Ace-high hands\n\nThe fact they checked flop and turn suggests:\n- They don't have a strong made hand (like top pair+)\n- They might have a draw\n- They might have complete air\n- They might have a marginal made hand they're afraid of\n\n**My situation:**\n- I have bottom pair with a weak kicker\n- There are many draws on board\n- I'm out of position (relative to the opponent who will act after me on river)\n- The pot is very small (4 chips)\n- I have a deep stack (193 chips)\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- With 96.5 BB, I have a healthy stack\n- No immediate pressure from blinds or ICM considerations mentioned\n- The pot is tiny relative to my stack\n\n**Decision analysis:**\n\nOption 1: Check\n- Pros: No risk, see a free river card, pot control\n- Cons: Give free card to draws, miss value if opponent has weaker hand\n\nOption 2: Bet\n- Pros: Extract value from weaker hands, charge draws, take the pot now\n- Cons: Risk getting raised, building a big pot with marginal hand, difficult to get called by worse\n\nOption 3: Fold\n- Only if I think checking is -EV, but folding when checked to seems too tight\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. My hand is very vulnerable - many cards on river could be bad (any spade, any card 5-7, any T, J, Q, K, A)\n2. The board is very draw-heavy\n3. I'm out of position for the river\n4. The pot is tiny - not worth risking much\n5. My opponent has shown weakness by checking twice\n\n**What would I bet for value?**\n- Would opponent call with worse? Maybe hands like:\n  - 4x (but they have a better kicker likely)\n  - 3x (but 3s are now second pair)\n  - A high with no pair\n  - Smaller pocket pairs\n  - Draws\n\nBut if I bet and get called, I'm often behind or in bad shape against a draw.\n\n**What about betting as a bluff?**\n- I could try to represent a strong hand\n- But the opponent has shown no aggression, so they might just fold their weak hands anyway\n- And if they have a draw, I don't want to blow up the pot\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- If I bet, I need to consider what happens if I get raised\n- A small bet might be okay, but it commits me to the pot somewhat\n\n**My recommendation: Check**\n\nReasoning:\n1. My hand is marginal at best and very vulnerable\n2. The board is extremely draw-heavy, and I don't want to build a big pot\n3. I'm out of position for the river\n4. The pot is tiny - not worth fighting over\n5. Checking allows me to see a free river and re-evaluate\n6. If I bet and get called or raised, I'm in a tough spot\n7.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**My hand**: 8d 6h (8\u2666 6\u2665)\n**Board**: 4s Td 8s 3s Ts (4\u2660 T\u2666 8\u2660 3\u2660 T\u2660)\n\n**Hand strength**: I have a pair of 8s with a 6 kicker. The board shows two tens, and four spades (flush possible).\n\n**The nuts**: Any spade in the hand makes a flush. Also, any ten gives trips. I have neither.\n\n**Opponent behavior**: GPT-OSS-120B has been playing relatively cautiously. Looking at their history:\n- They've folded preflop 6 out of 9 times\n- When they do enter pots, they tend to bet aggressively on later streets (Hand 3: bet 15 on flop, 30 on turn)\n- In hand 5, they bet 2 on flop and 8 on turn\n- In hand 4, they check-folded on flop\n\nCurrent action: They've checked to me on the river. The pot is only 4 chips.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the button, which is good.\n\n**My options**: Check or raise (minimum raise to 2).\n\n**Analysis**: \n- If I check, I go to showdown with my pair of 8s and lose to any spade, any ten, or any higher pair.\n- If I bet, I might get a fold from hands that missed or have weak pairs, but any hand that calls likely beats me.\n- The opponent checked, which could mean weakness or a trap with a strong hand.\n\n**Pot odds**: The pot is tiny (4 chips), so there's not much to win. Betting risks 2 chips to win 4.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: I have 193 chips, so risking 2 chips isn't significant.\n\n**Decision**: With my weak pair and the board texture (flush possible, trips possible), and the opponent showing caution by checking, I should check back. There's a high likelihood I'm beat if I bet and get called, and the pot is too small to justify a bluff. Checking allows me to see a cheap showdown.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The opponent has checked on every street. This could indicate:\n1. They have nothing and are giving up\n2. They have a monster and are trying to induce a bluff\n\nGiven their history shows they like to bet when they have something (hands 3 and 5), the check-check-check line suggests weakness more often than strength.\n\nBut my hand is also very weak - just a pair of 8s. Many hands beat me:\n- Any spade (flush)\n- Any ten (trips)\n- Any pair higher than 8s\n- Any two pair\n\nWith such a weak hand on this board, I should just check and hope to win at showdown against complete air, or fold to any aggression (but there is none). The risk of betting and getting called by a better hand is too high for the small reward.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Board has flush and trips possibilities.

This gives me pot odds of 4:7 or about 36%, which is very favorable for pocket 8s.\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have pocket 8s - a strong starting hand\n2. I'm on the button (best position)\n3.

I have two options:\n- Call: Keeps the pot smaller, see the flop in position\n- Raise: Could isolate the tight player and take control\n\nSince MiniMax-M2 is tight and raised to 4 (2x BB), they likely have a strong range (AA-QQ, AK, maybe JJ-TT, AQ).

This is a disaster for pocket 8s. My hand is essentially worthless here. The best I can hope for is a full house if another T comes, but that's very unlikely.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They've folded preflop a lot (hands 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)\n- In hand 4, they called preflop, called flop, then bet turn\n- They seem fairly tight/passive overall\n- They raised preflop this hand to 4, then called my 3-bet to 12\n\n**Preflop Action:**\n- MiniMax-M2 raised to 4 (small raise)\n- I 3-bet to 12 on the button with 88\n- They called my 3-bet\n\n**What does their preflop call mean?**\nGiven they're usually tight, a call of my 3-bet suggests they have something decent. Could be:\n- A-x hands (now have trips)\n- Pocket pairs (now beat me unless they have 22-77)\n- T-x hands (now have trips with the T)\n- Suited connectors with clubs (flush draw)\n- Maybe some weird bluff\n\n**Current Action:**\nThey checked to me on the flop. This could mean:\n1. They missed and are giving up\n2. They have a monster and are trying to trap\n3. They have a draw and want to see a free card\n\n**My Decision:**\nWith pocket 8s on an As Ac Tc board, I have:\n- No pair (board has two aces higher than my 8s)\n- No draw to a straight or flush\n- Only 2 outs to a full house (the two remaining 8s, but even that might not be good)\n \nAn aggressive move would be pointless. The board completely destroys my hand, and checking is the only sensible option. I'll minimize my losses and see what develops without risking additional chips.",

Hands with an Ace or Ten CRUSH me.\n\nNow looking at the action:\n- Preflop: Seat 4 raised to 4, I re-raised to 12, Seat 4 called\n- Flop: Seat 4 checked, I checked\n- Turn: Seat 4 checked\n\nThe opponent has shown:\n- They raised preflop (could have Ax, Tx, premium pairs)\n- They called my 3-bet (could have Ax, Tx, premium pairs, or speculative hands)\n- They checked flop and turn (showing weakness)\n\nFrom the recall data, MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot preflop (hands 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), but in hand 4 they called preflop, called flop, and bet the turn.\n\nThe board is extremely dangerous for my pocket 8s. Any Ace or Ten beats me, and those are very likely holdings given the preflop action.\n\nHowever, my opponent has checked twice now (flop and turn). This shows significant weakness. They would likely bet their strong hands like Ax or Tx for value and protection.\n\nGiven I can check for free and see the river, I should check. Betting would be a bluff, but what would I be bluffing with? I have a decent hand (two pair) but it's very vulnerable. If I bet and get called, I'm likely beat. If I bet and they fold, they probably had a worse hand anyway.\n\nThe pot is 27 chips. Checking is the prudent play here. I have showdown value with my two pair, but I need to be careful. Let me check and see what the river brings.",

This is a very dangerous board for my pocket eights. Anyone with:\n- Any Ace has a full house (Aces full of Tens)\n- Any Ten has a full house (Tens full of Aces)\n- Any club has a flush (but I have no clubs)\n- The 5c gives a flush to anyone with any club\n\nMy hand: I have two eights with no clubs. The best I have is two pair (Aces and Tens with an 8 kicker), but that's very weak on this board.\n\n**Action analysis**:\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 raised to 4, I 3-bet to 12, they called\n- Flop: As Ac Tc - they checked, I checked\n- Turn: Ts - they checked, I checked\n- River: 5c - they bet 8 into a pot of 35\n\n**Opponent tendencies**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's history, they fold a lot preflop but did show some aggression in hand #4 with a turn bet. They've been relatively tight.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Pot: 35 chips\n- Bet: 8 chips\n- I need to call 8 to win 43 (pot odds: ~18.6%)\n- My hand is essentially a bluff catcher at this point\n\nThe small bet of 8 into 35 (23% pot) on this scary board could mean:\n1. They have a monster and want a call\n2. They're value betting a weaker hand\n3. They're bluffing with a missed draw\n\nGiven the board texture and the fact they called my 3-bet preflop, they could have:\n- Pocket pairs (JJ, QQ, KK, AA, TT) - all of which beat me except JJ/QQ\n- Ax hands (which now have a full house)\n- Some suited connectors with clubs that made a flush\n- Complete air (bluffing)\n\nGiven my hand is just two pair with a weak kicker on a double-paired, 4-flush board, I'm almost certainly beat by any Ace, any Ten, any club, or any pocket pair. The only hands I beat are pure bluffs.\n\nWith my stack of 184 chips, calling 8 chips won't hurt me much, but it's likely throwing chips away. The opponent's small bet could be a value bet with a strong hand or a blocker bet with a medium hand.\n\nI think the correct play here is to fold. My hand is too weak relative to this board texture, and I'm likely beat by many hands in my opponent's range.",

Let me think about the key factors:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 4c 9h is a terrible hand - offsuit, no straight potential (gap is too large), no flush potential, low cards. This is a clear fold in almost any situation.\n\n2. **Position**: Being UTG means I'm first to act post-flop and have 7 players left to act behind me. This is the worst position to play a marginal hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have a healthy stack at 92 BB, so I don't need to take risks with weak hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Let me check if there's any information about the opponents that might justify playing this hand. Actually, with 4-9 offsuit, there's really no justification regardless of opponent tendencies.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 to win 3, which is 1.5:1. But even with good pot odds, this hand has almost no potential to improve to a strong hand.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: Early in a tournament (or at any stage), playing 4-9 offsuit from UTG is -EV. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nI don't even need to check opponent tendencies here - this is a textbook fold situation. The hand has no redeeming qualities.\n\nLet me make the fold decision.",

The hand is too weak, position is bad, and there's no reason to get involved with such a marginal holding when I have a comfortable stack. Even if I hit an Ace, I'll often be outkicked. If I hit the 5, I'll have a weak pair with no kicker.\n\nThe only consideration might be that the table seems somewhat passive/tight based on the limited history, but that's not enough to justify playing A5o from UTG.\n\n\nI'll discard this hand without hesitation.

The raise to 6 seems significant.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nK6 offsuit is a very marginal hand. It's dominated by any other King (KA, KQ, KJ, KT, K9, K8, K7). The 6 kicker is terrible. This is generally a fold in most situations.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in the SB, which is the worst position. If I call, I'll be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nI need to call 5 to win 9, so getting less than 2:1. This is not great odds for a marginal hand.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack (90.5 BB), no need to take marginal spots. Better to preserve chips for better opportunities.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. K6 offsuit from SB facing a raise is a standard fold. The opponent's raise suggests strength, and I'd be out of position with a very weak hand that has poor equity against their range.",

Has folded preflop in 8 out of 10 recent hands. Only raised twice (both to 6 chips). Seems passive and tight.\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB): Also very tight! Has folded preflop in 7 out of 10 recent hands. Called once (hand #12) and checked down to showdown with Q3 suited, losing.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 84o is trash. Bottom 15% of hands.\n2. **Position**: Good position (BTN) but hand is too weak.\n3. **Opponents**: Both opponents are extremely tight, folding most hands.\n4. **Pot odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3 (1.5:1). Not good enough for this hand.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. No need to gamble with trash.\n\nWhile I could consider stealing since both opponents are tight, 84o is just too weak. Even if they fold 80% of the time, when they call I'm in terrible shape. The risk/reward isn't worth it.\n\n**Decision**: FOLD. This is a clear fold. Hand is too weak, even against tight opponents. Preserve chips for better spots.",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Strength**: Pocket Kings is the second-best starting hand in Hold'em. I should be very aggressive with this hand.\n\n**Position**: I'm in the CO (Cutoff), which is a good position - I'll act after the SB and BB, and I'll have position on the preflop raiser if I call.\n\n**Opponent Info**: GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 raised to 4 (a min-raise). Looking at their history:\n- They've been relatively tight, folding preflop in 4 of the last 6 hands\n- They made a raise in hand 10 (amount 8) and hand 15 (amount 6)\n- They tend to check down when they see flops (hand 9)\n- This suggests they might be raising with a somewhat wide range, but not extremely loose\n\n**Stack Sizes**: \n- I have 181 chips (90.5 BB) - a healthy stack\n- GPT-OSS-120B has 224 chips - also healthy\n- The raise is small relative to stacks (4 chips)\n\n**Pot Odds**: The pot is 7 chips, I need to call 4 chips. That's 7:4 or 1.75:1. With pocket Kings, this is a trivial call.\n\n**Action Decision**: With pocket Kings, I should definitely raise for value. I want to build the pot with my premium hand. A standard 3-bet size would be 3x the original raise, so 12 chips. However, I could also go slightly larger to 14-16 chips to really charge anyone wanting to see a flop.\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have a premium hand (KK)\n2. I'm in good position\n3. The raiser seems to be raising somewhat frequently but not extremely loose\n4. I want to build the pot and get value\n5. I want to potentially isolate against the original raiser\n\nI should make a substantial 3-bet. I'll raise to 14 chips, which is about 3.5x the original raise. This is a good size to get value while still being able to fold if things go terribly wrong postflop (though with KK, I'm rarely folding preflop).",

They raised preflop then checked flop here, which could mean:\n1. They have a marginal hand and are giving up\n2. They're trying to trap with a strong hand\n3. They have air and want to see a free card\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 12 chips\n- It costs me 0 to check\n- If I bet, minimum is 4 chips\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check: Take a free card, see if I hit my overcards\n2. Bet: Try to take down the pot now\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (91 BB)\n- The pot is relatively small (12 chips)\n- I have position advantage\n\n**Decision:**\nWith two overcards on a relatively dry board (only one heart draw), checking seems reasonable. I don't have a strong hand, and I have position. I can see a free card and potentially hit one of my overcards. If I bet and get called, I'm likely behind. \n\nChecking also gives me information - if opponent bets turn, I can reassess. If they check again, I might take a stab at the pot on the turn.\n\nLet me check back.",

They had a decent hand preflop (maybe AX, pocket pairs, broadway cards)\n2. The flop didn't help them much (Th 2h 3c)\n3. The turn 9s also didn't help them\n\nMy hand has decent equity with the open-ended straight draw, but it's not a made hand. Since I can check for free and see the river card without risking any chips, this is the best play. \n\nChecking allows me to:\n1. See a free river card\n2. Potentially hit my straight (8 outs)\n3. Avoid building a bigger pot with just a draw\n4. Potentially get to showdown cheaply if opponent checks again\n\nIf I bet, I might get called by better hands or forced to fold to a raise.

Let me think about what this could mean.\n\nPossible opponent holdings:\n1. Weak/medium pair that doesn't want to face a raise\n2. Complete air that gave up on the bluff\n3. Strong hand trying to induce a bet (but less likely given they checked all 3 streets)\n\nThe board: Th 2h 3c 9s Kc\n- Possible straights: QJ makes a straight (Q-J-T-9-8... wait, no. The board has T-9, so QJ would make a straight: J-T-9-8-7? No, the board doesn't have 8 or 7. Let me recount: Th-2h-3c-9s-Kc. There are no connected cards for a straight except maybe QJ would make K-Q-J-T-9 which is a straight! K-Q-J-T-9 is indeed a straight. But I only have Q-J, and the board has K-T-9, so I would need the cards to be K-Q-J-T-9 in order. That would be a straight! Wait, let me verify: K, Q, J, T, 9 in sequence. Yes, that's a straight! King-high straight.\n \nI'm carefully examining the board cards: Ten of hearts, Two of hearts, Three of clubs, Nine of spades, and King of clubs. My hand is Queen of clubs and Jack of diamonds. \n\nI realize I need to be precise about the straight possibility. The sequence K, Q, J, T, 9 would indeed create a King-high straight. However, I only hold Q-J, and the board provides K-T-9. I need all five cards in sequential order to complete the straight.\n\nMy actual hand is Kc Qc Jd Th 9s, which is just a King-high hand without a made straight or other strong combination. The potential straight I initially saw doesn't actually exist with these specific board and hole cards.\n\nThe hand strength is minimal - just King-high with a Queen kicker. Betting here would essentially be a pure bluff, hoping my opponent has an even weaker hand or will fold a marginal holding. The pre-flop raiser's check on the river suggests potential weakness, but without more information on their playing style, a bluff remains risky.\n\nI'll need to carefully consider my opponent's tendencies and the potential for them to call with a range of hands before deciding whether to attempt a bluff.

Only raised once in hand #16. This suggests a tight player.\n- BB (Seat 3): DeepSeek-V3.2 - This player has also been folding a lot preflop, only called once in hand #16 and folded in the other 8 hands. Also appears tight.\n\n**To Call**: 4 chips (1 BB)\n**To Raise**: Minimum 8 chips (2 BB)\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand Strength**: 3c Ts is a terrible hand. It's offsuit, has no straight potential (gap is too large), no flush potential, and even if I hit a 3 or a T, I'm likely to be dominated.\n\n2. **Position**: While being on the button is great, it doesn't make up for having such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: Both opponents appear to be tight players who fold frequently preflop. This might suggest I could steal the blinds, but:\n   - I'm on the button, not in late position stealing position (though BTN is good)\n   - The raise would need to be to at least 8 chips (2 BB)\n   - With 48 BB stack, I don't need to take marginal spots\n   \n4. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 6 chips, getting 1.5:1 odds. This would require me to win 40% of the time to break even, which is highly unlikely with 3c Ts against likely better hands.\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: I have a healthy stack of 48 BB. There's no pressure to make moves. Preserving my stack and waiting for better spots is the correct play.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, and I don't need to take unnecessary risks with a healthy stack. Even though the blinds appear tight and might fold to a steal, it's not worth risking 2 BB (8 chips) with such a poor hand. I'll wait for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3h 3c - Pocket threes, a small pocket pair. This is a speculative hand that plays best in multi-way pots where I can hit a set (three of a kind).\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table. I have to act first on every street, which is a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 193 chips (48.2 BB) - This is a healthy stack, giving me some flexibility.\n\n4. **Opponents**: Looking at the recent actions, I can see that:\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has been relatively active, raising to 6 in hand #19 and checking through\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) called a small bet in hand #18\n   - The players have been folding quite a bit, suggesting a somewhat tight table\n\n5. **Action**: I need to call 4 chips to see the flop. The minimum raise is to 8 chips.\n\n**Key considerations**:\n- UTG is a difficult position to play speculative hands from\n- Pocket threes have about 12% chance to hit a set on the flop\n- If I hit a set, I can potentially win a big pot (implied odds)\n- However, from UTG, I'm likely to face raises behind me, and if I don't hit the flop, I'll be in a tough spot out of position\n- The table seems somewhat tight, but that doesn't mean much from UTG\n- I have a healthy stack, so I can afford to see flops with speculative hands sometimes\n\n**Tournament considerations**:\n- With 48 BB, I'm not in desperate need to accumulate chips immediately\n- Losing a small pot won't hurt my stack significantly\n- However, playing out of position with a weak hand can lead to difficult decisions\n\n**Decision**: This is a borderline spot. Pocket pairs can be profitable, but from UTG with a small pair, it's generally a fold. The risk of facing a raise behind me and having to fold, or playing postflop out of position without hitting a set, outweighs the potential reward. The 4-chip call represents about 2% of my stack, which isn't huge, but the positional disadvantage is significant.\n\nI'll fold this hand from UTG. It's a standard conservative play that avoids tricky situations out of position with a hand that needs to hit a set to be profitable.",

Tens are connected but offsuit, and the 2 is very low. This is a trash hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG, the worst position at the table. I have to act first on every street, giving me no information about what others will do.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: I should check if I have any information about the opponents. Let me search for observations to see if there's any useful information.\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: \n   - I have a decent stack of 48.2 BB, which is healthy but not huge\n   - This is a tournament, so I need to be selective with my hands, especially from early position\n   - I shouldn't risk chips with marginal hands from bad position\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: The pot is 6, I need to call 4. That's 4 to win 6, or 1.5:1 odds. But this is irrelevant with such a weak hand.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold this hand. UTG with T2 offsuit is an easy fold in any situation. I don't even need to search for opponent tendencies - this is just too weak to play from early position.\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to play this hand by searching for observations about these opponents, but I suspect this will just confirm the fold.\n\nActually, let me just fold. This is a clear fold situation. T2 offsuit from UTG is one of the worst starting hands in poker. I don't need to waste time checking opponent tendencies for this decision.",

Folding preserves stack for better spots.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: 8c Th - This is a weak offsuit hand, not connected, no suited potential. It's a marginal hand at best.\n\n**Position**: BTN - Good position, but that doesn't make up for the weak hand.\n\n**Stack**: 189 chips (47.2 BB) - Healthy stack, but not deep enough to be playing marginal hands for big pots.\n\n**Current situation**:\n- Pot: 46 chips\n- I need to call 26 chips\n- Minimum raise to: 48 chips\n\n**Action history**:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) re-raised to 30\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n\n**Kimi-K2 (Seat 2)**: Very tight player. From the 10 recent actions, they've folded preflop in 8 out of 10 hands. Only raised once (hand 16) to 6 chips. This current raise to 12 is actually larger than their previous raise, suggesting they have a strong hand.\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5)**: More active player. They've been folding a lot preflop but did show some postflop aggression in hand 23. Their re-raise to 30 after Kimi-K2's raise is significant.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. My hand is very weak (T8o) - this is a fold in most situations\n2. I'm facing a 3-bet (re-raise) from GPT-OSS-120B\n3. Kimi-K2's initial raise was already strong given their tight nature\n4. The re-raise makes it even more likely both players have strong hands\n5. I need to call 26 chips which is about 14% of my stack\n6. Pot odds: 46:26 or about 1.77:1, which is not great given my hand strength\n7. Even if I hit something, I'll likely be dominated by better kickers or stronger hands\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. My hand is too weak, I'm facing aggression from two players, and the investment is too large relative to my hand's potential.",

They only played hand 24 where they raised preflop and showed aggression on the flop. This suggests they're playing a tight range.\n\n2. **My Hand**: I have 2h Js (offsuit). This is a very weak hand - Jack with a 2 offsuit. \n\n3. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN) which is the best position postflop. However, this is preflop.\n\n4. **Stack Size**: I have 187 chips (46.8 BB) which is a healthy stack.\n\n5. **Action**: It's folded to me on the Button. I need to call 2 chips to see the flop (pot is 6 chips). \n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (calling 2 to win 6), which is good.\n\nHowever, even with good pot odds, J2o is a terrible hand. Against a tight opponent in the BB who has been folding most hands, I should:\n- Not invest chips with such a weak hand\n- Save my chips for better spots\n- Even though I'm on the Button, this hand has very little playability postflop\n\nThe opponent is tight and will likely fold if I raise, but if they call or re-raise, I'm in bad shape. Raising with J2o is not a good strategy against a tight opponent.\n\nBest play here is to fold and wait for a better hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand, I have pocket sixes (6d 6h) on the button with 187 chips (46.8 BB). The blinds are 2/4, so this is a relatively deep stack situation.\n\nFrom the opponent actions I can see:\n- In hand 24, the other Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raised to 12 preflop and then called a 3-bet to 30\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) seems aggressive, making big raises and bets\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) folded preflop in hand 24 after the raise\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) also folded\n\nCurrently in this hand:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted SB of 2\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) posted BB of 4\n- Seats 4 and 5 folded\n\nSo it's on me (button) to act. I need to call 4 to see the flop.\n\nWith pocket sixes on the button, this is a decent hand. I have:\n- Position advantage (acting last post-flop)\n- Pocket pair that can flop a set (about 12% chance)\n- If I don't hit a set, I can often continuation bet and take it down\n- My stack is healthy at 46.8 BB\n\nI should consider raising here. A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 12 chips. This would:\n- Build the pot when I hit a set\n- Give me initiative post-flop\n- Potentially take down the blinds preflop\n- Charge opponents to see the flop\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, I think raising is the best play. I'll raise to 12 (3x BB).\n\nLet me check my stack if I raise to 12: 187 - 12 = 175 chips left, which is still 43.75 BB - very healthy.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise to: 8. So I could raise to 8, 9, 10, etc. \n\nI'm weighing the pros and cons of different raise sizes. A 12-chip raise feels like the sweet spot - substantial enough to show strength and protect my hand, but not so large that it commits too many chips. The 3x BB raise aligns with standard poker strategy, giving me control of the pot while maintaining flexibility. It sends a clear message of strength without overcommitting my stack.\n\nThe button position gives me additional leverage. I can apply pressure, control the pot size, and potentially take down the hand preflop. With a pocket pair, I'm in a strong position to dictate the action and potentially build the pot if I connect with the board.\n\nMy tournament life isn't immediately threatened, so I can make a calculated move that balances aggression with strategic positioning. The raise feels like the most advantageous play in this scenario.",

Folding to a raise.\"\n}\n```",
          "reasoning_content": "  I have a pair of sixes on a flop of 9c 7d 3h. This is a relatively dry board with no flush draw and only a gutshot straight draw possible (8-6 would make a straight). My opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 has checked to me.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have a pocket pair (66). The board is 9-7-3. I'm currently ahead of any hand that doesn't have a 9, 7, 3, or pocket pair higher than 6. However, I'm vulnerable to many overcards.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is the best position. I have the advantage of acting last.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been quite tight:\n   - They fold preflop very often (most hands)\n   - When they do call preflop (hands 12, 16, 22), they tend to bet on the flop\n   - In hand 16, they called preflop and bet 8 on flop\n   - In hand 22, they called preflop and bet 5 on flop\n   - They check-called in hand 12 and checked through\n\n   The fact that they checked here suggests they might have missed the flop or have a marginal hand. Their typical pattern is to bet when they have something.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 26 chips. If I bet, I need to consider what size.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 175 chips (43.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. I can afford to make a play here.\n\nThe board is relatively dry - no flush draws, only a gutshot straight draw (8-6 or 8-5 would make a straight). This is a good board to continuation bet as the preflop aggressor.\n\nI raised preflop to 12 and got called by the BB. Now they've checked to me. Standard play here would be to make a continuation bet to represent having a strong hand and to protect my equity.\n\nWith a dry board like this, a bet of about 50-70% of the pot would be appropriate. The pot is 26, so a bet of around 13-18 chips makes sense.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that my opponent called a preflop raise. What hands would they call with?\n- Pocket pairs (77, 88, 99, TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA)\n- Suited connectors\n- Broadways\n\nIf they have 77, 99, or 33, I'm crushed. If they have 88, TT+, I'm behind. If they have two overcards, I'm ahead.\n\nGiven that they checked, it's less likely they have a strong hand like a set or top pair. They would likely bet those to protect against draws and get value.\n\nI think a continuation bet is appropriate here to:\n1. Get value from worse hands (overcards)\n2. Protect my hand against overcards\n3. Take down the pot when they have nothing\n\nLet me bet around 60% of pot, so about 15-16 chips. The minimum raise is 8, so I need to raise to at least 8 total, but since there's nothing to call, I need to bet. The minimum raise to 8 means I can put in 8 chips as a bet, but that's too small. I should bet more.\n\nWait, let me re-read the legal actions. It says \"Minimum raise to: 8\". Since there's nothing to call (amount to call is 0), and I can raise, this means I can bet. The minimum bet is 8. So I can bet anywhere from 8 up to my stack.\n\nA bet of 16 (roughly 2/3 pot) seems good. This is enough to put pressure on overcards but not too big that I'm committed if I get raised.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking at the opponent's pattern again - they tend to bet on the flop when they have something. The fact that they checked suggests weakness. I could also consider checking behind to pot control and see a free turn card. But with a vulnerable hand like 66, I should probably bet to protect my hand.\n\nI think betting is the right play. Let me go with 16 chips (about 62% of pot).",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: J\u2660 5\u2660 - This is a marginal hand. It's suited but very weak. J5s is not a strong hand, especially from the BB.\n\n**Position**: BB (out of position post-flop)\n\n**Stack**: 197 chips (49.2 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + MiniMax-M2's raise of 12)\n- I need to call 8 chips to see the flop\n- MiniMax-M2 raised to 12 from what appears to be CO position (Seat 4)\n\n**Opponent analysis**: MiniMax-M2 has been relatively active. Looking at their recent actions:\n- They fold a lot preflop (hands 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26)\n- They do call sometimes (hand 23, 28)\n- When they call/bet, they seem to continue aggression on flop (hands 23, 27, 28)\n- In hand 23, they called a turn bet then bet the river\n- In hand 28, they called preflop, bet flop, called a raise, then folded on turn\n\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 is capable of raising with a somewhat wide range, but they don't seem overly aggressive. The raise size of 3x (12 chips) is standard.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 18, giving me 2.25:1 pot odds. This means I need ~31% equity to call profitably.\n\n**Hand equity**: J5s against a typical CO raising range (maybe 15-20% of hands) has roughly 30-35% equity. So it's borderline.\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. I'm out of position, which makes it harder to realize my equity\n2. J5s can flop some decent draws (flush draws, straight draws)\n3. I have a healthy stack, so calling 8 chips won't hurt me much\n4. However, I'm likely dominated by better Jx hands and my kicker is very weak\n5. The opponent seems competent enough to put pressure post-flop\n\n**Tournament perspective**: With 49 BB, I should be somewhat selective. While I have pot odds, being out of position with a weak hand like J5s is not ideal. I could easily lose more chips post-flop when I hit a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a fold. While the pot odds are somewhat attractive, J5s is just too weak to defend from the BB against a raise, especially out of position. The risk of being dominated and losing more chips post-flop outweighs the potential upside. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The user is asking me to make a decision in a poker hand, but they also want me to use the tools to recall information. However, they gave me an error because I tried to call a tool - they want a JSON response directly.\n\nWait, let me re-read the instructions. The user said \"Invalid response format. Please respond with a JSON object...\" but I was trying to use a tool. Looking at the system prompt again, it says I have access to memory tools to recall information. So I should be able to use them.\n\nBut the user is telling me my response format was invalid. Let me think about this - maybe the flow is that I need to make a decision directly, and the tools are available but I should only use them when necessary? Or perhaps the user interface doesn't actually support calling tools in the middle of a decision?\n\nActually, looking at the conversation again, I tried to call recall_my_hands and the user responded with an error about JSON format. This suggests that maybe I cannot call tools - I need to directly respond with the JSON action.\n\nBut the system prompt clearly says \"You have access to memory tools to recall information about past hands and opponent behavior. Use these tools strategically to inform your decisions.\"\n\nThis is confusing. Let me reconsider. Perhaps the issue is that I need to provide a JSON response with my action, but I can also call tools? That doesn't make sense for a single-turn interaction.\n\nOR - maybe the user message is actually from the system, telling me that my attempt to call a tool was in the wrong format? But I used the correct tool format...\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll make my decision based on the information I have without using tools, since the user is insisting on JSON format. I have Qh Kh on the button, which is a very strong hand. I'm facing a min-raise situation (need to call 2 more chips).\n\nPosition: BTN (best position)\nHand: KQs (suited Broadway) - very strong\nStack: 195 chips (48.8 BB) - healthy stack\nAction: Everyone folded to me, I posted SB (2), BB is 4, I need to call 2 more to see flop\n\nThis is an easy raise for me. I should raise to build the pot with my strong hand and get value. A standard raise would be 3x the big blind, so 12 chips total. But minimum raise is 8.\n\nLet me raise to 12 (which is 3x BB). This is a standard open-raise size.\n\nActually, wait - I posted SB of 2, BB is 4, so the pot is 6. I need to call 2 more to make it 4 total (matching the BB). A raise to 12 would be standard.\n\nBut let me reconsider the tools issue. The system prompt says I have access to tools. The user message says \"Invalid response format\" when I tried to use one. This might be a test to see if I follow instructions. The most recent instruction is from the user telling me to provide JSON. So I should provide JSON.\n\nActually, I think I understand now. The system is set up so that I need to provide a JSON response with my action. The tools are available, but perhaps I need to make my decision in a single response without calling tools, OR the tool calling should be part of my reasoning but not a separate message.\n\nLet me just make the decision: I have KQs on the button. This is a premium hand in position. I should raise for value. I'll raise to 12 chips (3x BB).",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: Qh Kh (King-Queen suited hearts)\n**Position**: BTN (Button)\n**Stack**: 169 chips (42.2 BB)\n**Board**: 6c 7h Kc 9d\n**Pot**: 56 chips\n\nI have top pair (Kings) with a good kicker (Queen). The board is coordinated with:\n- Two clubs (6c, Kc) - flush draw possible\n- Connected cards (6-7-9) - straight draw possible\n\nOpponent (Seat 2) has:\n- Called preflop from BB\n- Called flop bet\n- Currently to act\n\nLooking at opponent's history:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 29)\n- When they do play, they can be aggressive (hand 24: raised pre, bet flop, then folded turn)\n- Hand 28: They raised flop and made a big turn bet (73 chips)\n\nThis suggests they're somewhat tight but capable of aggression when they have something.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Pot is 56 chips\n- I have 169 chips left\n- No bet to call (can check or bet)\n- I have top pair good kicker\n\nThe turn card (9d) is somewhat scary as it completes some straight draws (8-T would have a straight, and 5-8 now has an open-ender). The flush draw is still possible.\n\nI should consider:\n1. **Value betting**: I likely have the best hand but need to protect against draws\n2. **Pot control**: Check to avoid building a big pot with a vulnerable hand\n3. **Opponent's range**: They called preflop and flop - could have Kx, clubs, straight draws, or middle pairs\n\nGiven the coordinated board and potential draws, I think a value bet is appropriate to charge draws and get value from worse hands. I need to size it appropriately.\n\nA bet of around 1/2 to 2/3 pot (28-37 chips) would be good for value and protection. The minimum raise is 16, but that's too small - it gives draws good odds.\n\nLet me bet 32 chips (about 57% of pot) to charge draws while still getting called by worse hands.",

Jack-high with a 7 kicker is not a strong hand.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. This gives me some advantage.\n\n**Stack:** 137 chips (34.2 BB) - I'm in decent shape, not short-stacked.\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - Has been fairly active with a mix of folds, raises, and calls. From the data, they raised in hands 24 and 28, called in hands 24 and 30, and folded often. They showed down K9o in hand 30. They seem to be playing a reasonable range.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - Has been quite passive, folding most hands. They called small bets in hands 22, 26, and 27, but folded to most aggression. They seem tight.\n\n**Pot:** 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n\n**Action:** I need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** J7o is a weak hand that should be folded in most situations. The only redeeming factor is my position on the button.\n2. **Opponent Tendencies:** \n   - SB (Kimi-K2) seems moderately aggressive, capable of raising with decent hands\n   - BB (DeepSeek-V3.2) is tight and folds to aggression often\n3. **Pot Odds:** I need to call 4 to win 6, so 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not enough to justify playing a weak hand.\n4. **Implied Odds:** With J7o, I don't have good implied odds. If I hit a Jack, I could be dominated by better Jacks. If I hit two pair, it's vulnerable. The only really strong hand I can make is a straight (which is unlikely).\n5. **Tournament Considerations:** I have a decent stack and there's no need to gamble with a weak hand. Better opportunities will come.\n\n\nI'll cut my losses and wait for a stronger hand. Folding is the most prudent move here, preserving my chips for a better opportunity. The weak hand combined with unfavorable pot odds makes this an easy decision.",

I'll be acting first postflop.\n\n**Stack**: 137 chips (34.2 BB) - This is a decent tournament stack, giving me some room to play.\n\n**Blinds**: 2/4 - The pot is 6 chips (1.5 BB)\n\n**Opponents**: Looking at the recent actions, I can see:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been active, calling and raising\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Posted SB, folded to a raise in hand #31\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Posted BB, has folded preflop multiple times\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Folded this hand\n\n**Key considerations**:\n1. **Hand strength**: K5s is a weak hand from UTG. The suitedness gives some potential, but it's easily dominated by better Kings and the 5 kicker is very weak.\n2. **Position**: Being UTG is terrible for playing marginal hands. I'll have multiple players acting after me.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) seems to be an active player who calls and raises. This makes playing a marginal hand from UTG even more dangerous.\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 34.2 BB, I have a playable stack. I shouldn't be risking chips with marginal hands from bad position.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. K5s is not strong enough to open from UTG position, especially against opponents who have shown activity. The risk of being dominated by better Kings or facing aggression from later positions is too high. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I'm in the BB with 3d 7h, which is a very weak hand (27 offsuit). The action has come to me with just MiniMax-M2 calling from what appears to be middle position (Seat 4). \n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n1. **Hand strength**: 3d 7h is trash. Not connected, not suited, low cards. This is a fold in almost any situation.\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, so I'll be out of position postflop.\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 called from middle position. Looking at their recent history, they've been fairly passive - they folded preflop in hands 30, 31, and 33, raised once in hand 29, and played a very passive hand 32 (checking all streets then folding river). This suggests they're not super aggressive.\n4. **Pot odds**: There's 10 chips in the pot and I can check to see a free flop. So pot odds are infinite (free look).\n5. **Stack size**: I have 133 chips (33.2 BB), which is a decent stack but not deep enough to mess around with trash hands.\n\nEven though I can check for free, playing 37o out of position is a recipe for losing chips. The hand has almost no potential - it would need to hit two pair or better to likely be good, which is very unlikely (roughly 2% chance). Even if I hit one pair, it will often be dominated.\n\nThe only argument for checking is that it's free and I have a decent stack. But tournament poker is about preserving chips and not bleeding them away with marginal spots. This is a clear fold situation.\n\nWait, I need to reconsider. The amount to call is 0, which means I can check. In poker, when you're in the BB and everyone just calls, you have the option to check and see a free flop. Since there's no bet to call, \"fold\" would mean giving up my BB investment completely without seeing a flop.\n\nHowever, with 37o, even a free flop is often not worth it because:\n1. I'll be out of position\n2. The hand has extremely poor equity\n3. I could get trapped with a weak hand\n4. It can lead to difficult decisions postflop\n\nBut technically, since it's free, some players might argue to take the flop. I think this is still a fold because the long-term EV of checking with 37o is negative due to the reverse implied odds and positional disadvantage.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. In tournament poker with 33 BB, I should be more selective. The EV of checking 37o is almost certainly negative. I should fold and save my chips for better spots.",

It's not suited, not connected well (gap), and low cards. This is a fold in most situations.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the button which is great position, but that doesn't make up for such a weak hand.\n\n**Stack Size**: I have 141 chips (35.2 BB) which is a decent stack but not deep enough to play speculative hands like this profitably.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**: Looking at the opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2), I can see they've been fairly active:\n- They fold preflop often (hands 26, 27, 29, 33, 34)\n- But they also raise sometimes (hand 28, 31)\n- In hand 30, they called preflop and went all the way to showdown with Kd 9h\n\nThe opponent seems to be playing a somewhat straightforward game - folding weak hands, playing decent ones. They're not overly aggressive.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 2 to win a pot of 6, so 3:1 odds. But with 86o, even these odds aren't good enough.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: While I'm not super short stacked, I shouldn't be bleeding chips with garbage hands. The button gives me steal opportunities, but 86o is too weak even for a steal attempt. If I raise and get called, I'll be out of position postflop with a weak hand.\n\nThe only argument for playing this hand is the good position and the fact that everyone else has folded, so it's just me vs the BB. But 86o is just too weak. Even if the BB folds 50% of the time to a steal, it's not profitable with this hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

The hand has:\n- No high card value\n- No suitedness\n- No connectivity (gap of 5 ranks)\n- Very low chance of making a strong hand postflop\n\nWhile I could theoretically try to steal the blinds with a raise, this is not a good spot:\n1.

It has very little potential to make strong hands.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position. I'll be acting first on every street, giving me a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recalled actions, I can see that players are folding frequently preflop (Seat 4 folded multiple times, Seat 5 folded multiple times), but there was one raise from Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) in hand #36. This suggests players are relatively tight.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 35 BB, I have a workable stack. I should preserve chips and wait for better spots rather than playing garbage hands from early position.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is 6 chips and I need to call 4 chips, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds. Even with these odds, 63o is just too weak to play from UTG.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. Playing 63o from UTG would be a significant mistake. I should wait for better hands and better positions.",

This gives me a significant advantage.\n\n3. **Stack**: 137 chips (34.2 BB) - This is a healthy stack, not too short.\n\n4. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B in SB position. Looking at their history:\n   - They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 25-32, 34-37)\n   - They called in hand 33 (check-called on flop then folded turn)\n   - They showed aggression in hand 24 with a raise on flop and bet on turn\n   - Overall, they seem tight but capable of aggression when they play\n\n5. **Action**: SB posted 2, I posted BB 4, and SB just called the additional 2 (not raised). This suggests they don't have a premium hand.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: There's 8 in the pot, and it costs me 0 to check. I have a free look at the flop.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack and can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position.\n\nGiven that I have a strong suited hand in position, facing a limp from SB, I should raise. Raising achieves several things:\n- Builds the pot when I likely have the best hand\n- Gives me initiative post-flop\n- Can win the pot immediately\n- Puts pressure on the opponent\n\nSince the minimum raise is 8 (2x the BB), and I have a healthy stack, I should raise to something like 12-16 (3-4x BB). This is a standard raise size.\n\nLet me check if there are any relevant observations about this specific situation.",

They made a large raise (30) in hand 24, then another raise on the flop (60). They've also folded many times recently (hands 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37). In hand 39, they called then folded.\n\nThe pattern suggests they raise with a wide range but also fold frequently. The current raise to 12 seems standard.\n\n**Hand Strength**:\n- KTo is a marginal hand, especially from SB\n- Dominated by KJ, KQ, AK\n- Decent against weaker hands but vulnerable\n- In SB, I'm out of position for the entire hand\n\n**Pot odds**: Need to call 10 chips to win 18 (already 2+4+12). That's 10/28 = 35.7% equity needed.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have 35.8 BB, a healthy stack\n- Don't want to play big pots out of position with marginal hands\n- Could 3-bet as a squeeze play since it's just me and BB left\n\n**Decision**: \nFrom SB, KTo is a fold against a standard raise. It's too weak to call out of position, and 3-betting would be a bluff that risks too many chips. The opponent's raise size is standard, and while they fold sometimes, they're not super tight. \n\nI should fold and preserve my chips for better spots.",

This is a clear fold in almost all situations.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the BTN, which is good position, but my hand is too weak to play even in position.\n\n**Stack**: 143 chips (17.9 BB) - I'm in decent shape but not deep stacked. I should preserve my chips.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 33, 34, 38, 39, 40). They did raise to 12 in hands 36 and 37. They called down in hand 37 but folded on river, showing they can be sticky but eventually fold.\n- Seat 3 (BB): Has been very tight, folding in 7 out of 10 recent hands (hands 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40). They called once (hand 33) and folded preflop in hand 34. When they did play hand 33, they bet on flop and turn, suggesting they play straightforwardly when they have a hand.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to win 12, getting 1.5:1 odds. But with 35o, even these odds aren't good enough.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 17.9 BB, I have a workable stack. I shouldn't waste 8 chips (1 BB) on a hand this weak. I should wait for better spots.\n\nThis is a clear fold. 35o is in the bottom 10% of hands and should almost always be folded preflop, especially when facing a standard raise.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The hand is preflop with me in UTG position. I have K\u2663 J\u2665. My stack is 143 chips (17.9 BB). Blinds are 4/8, so it's 8 to call.\n\nLet me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: K\u2663 J\u2665 is a decent hand but not premium. It's offsuit and from UTG, this is typically a fold in most situations, especially with deeper stacks. With 17.9 BB, I'm in the \"short stack\" territory but not desperate yet.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act postflop. This is a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, I see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has been folding a lot preflop\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has been somewhat active, making a raise in hand 40\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) and the other Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) have mixed actions\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I'm at 17.9 BB. This is a critical stack size - I'm not in push/fold territory yet (usually <10-12 BB), but I need to be careful. I don't want to bleed chips.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 17.9 BB, I should be relatively tight from early position. I need to preserve my stack for better spots, preferably in later position or with stronger hands.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: 8 chips to call into a pot of 12, so 1.5:1 odds. This isn't really relevant since I'm deciding whether to play the hand at all, not whether to call a raise.\n\nStandard poker strategy says KJo from UTG is a fold, especially with a sub-20 BB stack. The hand is too easily dominated by better kings (AK, KQ) and better jacks (AJ, KJ). The offsuit nature reduces its playability, and being out of position makes it even worse.\n\nI should fold this hand and wait for a better spot, preferably in later position or with a stronger hand.",

The hand is too weak, I'm out of position, the opponent appears to be tight (making their raise more meaningful), and calling would cost me too much of my stack relative to my chances of winning.\n\nI could consider a re-raise as a bluff since the opponent seems tight, but with 2c 4s this is too risky. If they call, I'm in terrible shape post-flop with no equity. And if they shove, I have to fold. It's better to preserve my chips for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** Ts 3h (Ten of spades, Three of hearts) - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and with a large gap.\n\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - This is the best position at the table, but...\n\n**Stack:** 131 chips (16.4 BB) - This is a short stack situation. I'm in \"push/fold\" territory, especially with a weak hand.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 28 chips\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 16\n- Seat 5 folded\n- I need to call 16 to see the flop\n\n**Key considerations:**\n\n1. **Hand strength:** Ts 3h is trash. It's not connected, not suited, low kicker. This hand has very little equity even against random hands.\n\n2. **Position:** While BTN is good, it doesn't make up for having a terrible hand.\n\n3. **Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 raised from MP (middle position) to 2x the BB (16 chips). This is a min-raise. I don't have history on this opponent from the search, but they're in middle position with a healthy stack (255 chips = ~32 BB).\n\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 16 to win a pot of 28. That's 16/(28+16) = 16/44 = ~36% pot odds. My hand likely has much less equity than that.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With 16.4 BB, I need to be very selective. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not calling raises with marginal hands. Calling 16 chips would cost me 12% of my stack with a hand that will rarely hit and will be difficult to play post-flop.\n\n6. **Stack preservation:** Calling here would leave me with 115 chips. If I miss the flop (which I will most of the time), I'll have invested 16 chips for nothing. This is a leak that will bleed my stack.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, the stack size is too short to play speculative hands, and calling would commit too much of my stack with poor odds.",

It's offsuit, not connected, and the queen is dominated by many hands. This is a clear fold in almost all situations.\n\n**Position considerations:**\n- UTG is the worst position preflop - I'll be first to act on all streets\n- I have 8 players behind me who could have strong hands\n- With a weak hand like Q6o, I should be very tight from UTG\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- I have 16.4 BB, which is a short/medium stack\n- I need to preserve my chips for better spots\n- Calling 8 chips (1 BB) would cost me ~6% of my stack with a very weak hand\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data, I can see:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) has raised preflop recently (Hand 44)\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has been active with calls and raises\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has also raised preflop\n- Generally, players seem willing to play hands and some are aggressive\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- With 16.4 BB, I'm in the danger zone but not desperate yet\n- I should wait for a much better hand to commit chips\n- Q6o from UTG has very low equity against typical calling/raising ranges\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. Q6o is not a playable hand from UTG with any stack size, especially with a medium-short stack where preservation is important.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3d Kd (King-3 offsuit, but suited)\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun - first to act)\n3. **Stack**: 131 chips (16.4 BB)\n4. **Blinds**: 4/8, so it's 8 to call\n\nLet me analyze:\n\n**Hand Strength**: K3s is a marginal hand. The suited King has some potential, but the kicker is very weak. This is generally not a good hand to play from early position.\n\n**Position**: UTG is the worst position. I have 4 players behind me who could have much better hands. From UTG, I should be playing a very tight range.\n\n**Stack Size**: 16.4 BB is getting short. In tournament poker with a short stack, I need to be selective but also look for spots to accumulate chips. However, with a marginal hand from worst position, this isn't the right spot.\n\n**My History**: Looking at my hand history, I've been very tight - 39 folds out of 47 hands (83% fold rate). I've only won 7 hands. This suggests I've been playing very conservatively, which is appropriate given my short stack.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**: From the preflop actions I can see:\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has both folded and raised\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has raised and folded\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been folding a lot\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 has been folding\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With 16.4 BB, I'm in the \"push/fold\" territory. I should be looking for spots to either shove all-in or fold. Playing marginal hands for a standard raise from early position is not optimal.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. K3s from UTG with a short stack is not a profitable play. I should wait for a better spot, preferably from late position or with a stronger hand. The risk of running into a better King or any premium hand from one of the 4 players behind is too high.\n\nThe pot odds are 8 to win 12 (1.5:1), which might seem okay, but the implied odds are poor with a weak kicker, and the reverse implied odds (losing a big pot when dominated) are significant.",

It's in the bottom 20% of starting hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position, but my hand is just too weak.\n\n3. **Action**: DeepSeek-V3.2 in Seat 3 raised to 24 chips (3x the big blind). This is a significant raise. Let me check their history:\n   - From the recall, I can see DeepSeek-V3.2 has been very tight, folding most hands\n   - They only raised preflop once before (hand #44) for 24 chips\n   - In hand #33, they showed aggression with bets on flop and turn\n   - Overall, they seem to be a tight-aggressive player who doesn't raise often\n\n4. **Stack sizes**:\n   - My stack: 123 chips (15.4 BB)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2: 115 chips\n   - I have a medium-short stack in tournament context\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 chips to win 36 chips = 2.25:1 pot odds. This is not enough for a hand this weak.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 15.4 BB, I need to be selective. This is not a good spot to defend with such a weak hand against a tight player's raise.\n\n7. **Implied odds**: Even if I hit something, my hand is easily dominated. If I hit an 8, I could be against a bigger 8. If I hit a 4, it's almost never good.\n\nThe opponent's tight raising range means they're likely holding strong hands (pairs, high cards, strong suited connectors). My 84o has very little equity against that range.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is an easy fold with a trash hand against a tight player's raise. \n\nI'll conserve my tournament chips for a better opportunity. The risk-reward ratio simply doesn't justify calling with such a weak hand against a tight opponent's raise.",

Even if called, I have some playability post-flop in position.\"\n}\n```",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: Q9 offsuit - This is a marginal hand. Q9o is not a premium hand but has some potential, especially in position.\n\n**My position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position post-flop. I get to act last on every street.\n\n**My stack**: 119 chips (14.9 BB) - I'm short-stacked. With less than 15 big blinds, I need to be looking for spots to either shove or fold. I don't have room to play speculative hands.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Everyone folded to me on the button\n- I need to call 4 chips to see the flop (pot is 12, I posted 4 as SB)\n- The BB (Kimi-K2) is the only player left\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Looking at Kimi-K2's recent actions:\n- They folded preflop in hands 38-40, 42-49 (very tight)\n- In hand 36-37 they were raising preflop (older hands)\n- In hand 41 they called preflop, then bet on turn and river\n\nThis suggests Kimi-K2 has been playing very tight recently, folding 9 out of the last 10 hands preflop.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 14.9 BB, I should generally be playing a push/fold strategy. Q9o is a borderline hand for a button shove with this stack size. Against a tight BB who folds a lot, I could consider stealing.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 4 to win 12 (3:1 odds). If I raise, minimum is 16 (which is a significant portion of my stack).\n\n**Decision**: \n- Folding is safe but maybe too tight given my position and opponent's tightness\n- Calling is not ideal with a short stack and marginal hand - I'd be playing post-flop out of position with a weak hand\n- Raising to 16 (minimum) commits about 13% of my stack. Given that the BB has been folding 90% of the time, a steal attempt could be profitable\n\nGiven that Kimi-K2 has folded 9/10 recent hands preflop, and I'm on the button with a short stack where I need to accumulate chips, I think a raise (steal attempt) is the best play. The minimum raise to 16 seems appropriate - it's enough to put pressure without risking my whole stack.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 14.9 BB, a min-raise to 16 leaves me with 103 behind. If I get called or raised, I'm in a tough spot with Q9o. \n\nThe more standard play with this stack size would be either:\n1. Fold - preserve my stack for a better spot\n2. Shove all-in - maximize fold equity\n\nGiven the opponent's extreme tightness (folding 90% of hands), a shove might actually get through often enough to be profitable. Q9o is a decent hand for a button shove against a tight player.\n\nLet me think about the math: If they fold 90% of the time, I win 12 chips. 10% of the time they call (likely with a strong range), and I'll have about 30-40% equity. The EV might be positive.\n\nBut actually, looking at standard push/fold charts, Q9o from the button at 15 BB is typically a fold against a standard opponent. However, against someone folding 90% of hands, it becomes a clear shove.\n\nI'll go with a raise (steal attempt) rather than an all-in shove. The minimum raise to 16 risks fewer chips and should still accomplish the goal of stealing the blinds given how tight the BB has been playing.",

This is a marginal hand in early position. Let me think about the factors:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Q5s is not a strong starting hand. It's suited, which gives some flush potential, but the kicker (5) is very weak. In UTG, this is a clear fold.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position (first to act). I need a much stronger hand range from this position.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 139 chips (17.4 BB), which is getting short. I need to be selective with my spots and preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n4. **Recent play**: I've been very tight, which is good. My opponents likely see me as a tight player. I should maintain this image and only play strong hands.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 17.4 BB, I'm not desperate yet, but I can't afford to bleed chips on marginal hands. I should wait for a better spot, preferably in late position or with a stronger hand.\n\n6. **Opponents**: Looking at the table, DeepSeek-V3.2 (SB) and MiniMax-M2 (BB) are the only players left to act. MiniMax-M2 has a big stack (287 chips), so they could defend their BB aggressively.\n\nQ5s from UTG is a clear fold. I should preserve my chips for a better opportunity.",

I cannot afford to play marginal hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recent actions, I see:\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising preflop (raised to 16 in hand 51, and to 24 in hand 52)\n   - Seats 3, 4, and 5 have been folding frequently\n   - This suggests the table might be somewhat tight or at least the players behind me are folding to raises\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to win 12.

They seem to play relatively tight and straightforward. In hand 45, they raised from SB and won preflop, suggesting they defend their blind sometimes but generally play tight.\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm on the button (best position)\n- My stack is 16.4 BB, which is getting short\n- With AKs, I want to build the pot and potentially get all-in\n- The pot is currently 16 chips (2 BB)\n\n\n- I need to extract maximum value from this premium hand\n\nI'll focus on a strategic raise that builds pot pressure. With my tight table image, a significant raise should signal strength. I'll target a 3-4x big blind raise to extract value and potentially force a fold from my cautious opponent. This approach maximizes my chances of either winning the pot immediately or setting up a favorable all-in scenario.",

It's unsuited, not connected, and has low cards.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position. However, with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n**Stack Size:** I have 143 chips (17.9 BB), which is a decent stack but not huge. I should be selective with my calls.\n\n**Pot Size:** 12 chips (SB+BB)\n**Amount to call:** 8 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 has been quite tight lately, mostly folding preflop. They did raise in hands 51 (16) and 52 (24), but otherwise mostly folds.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 has been extremely tight, folding almost every hand. They only raised once (hand 49) and otherwise folded every other hand.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I'm getting 12:8 or 1.5:1 odds. This means I need 40% equity to break even on a call. With 7-3 offsuit, I have terrible equity against any reasonable range.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** With 17.9 BB, I have a workable stack. I shouldn't be throwing away 8 chips (1 BB) on a garbage hand like this. I need to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. My hand is terrible, I'm not getting good enough pot odds, and both opponents appear to be playing relatively tight. Even though I'm on the button, 7-3 offsuit is simply not a playable hand in this situation.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 2d 5c (offsuit, very weak hand)\n**Position:** UTG (first to act, worst position)\n**Stack:** 143 chips (17.9 BB) - This is a relatively short stack\n**Blinds:** 4/8\n**Pot:** 12 chips\n**Amount to call:** 8 chips\n\n**Key considerations:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength:** 2-5 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. It has very little potential - no straight possibilities (except a gutshot to 3-4-6-7), no flush possibility, and even if you hit a pair, it's a very weak pair.\n\n2. **Position:** UTG is the worst position to play a weak hand from. I'll have to act first on every street, giving all opponents the advantage of seeing my actions before they act.\n\n3. **Stack Size:** With 17.9 BB, I'm in the \"short stack\" territory. I need to be selective with my hands and preserve my chips for better spots. This is not a good hand to risk chips with.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** I need to call 8 to win 12, which is 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not enough to justify playing such a weak hand.\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations:** With a short stack, I should be looking for spots to either shove (all-in) with strong hands or fold and wait for better opportunities. Playing marginal hands from early position with a short stack is a recipe for disaster.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, position is bad, and my stack size is too short to be playing such speculative hands. I should preserve my chips for a better opportunity.\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools here - this is a straightforward decision based on basic poker fundamentals. 2-5 offsuit is a fold in virtually any situation, especially UTG with a short stack.",

It's offsuit with no connectivity and low cards. This is definitely a fold in most situations, but since I already posted the BB and it's just a check to see the flop, I need to consider checking.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Very tight player - folded preflop in 16 out of 20 recent hands\n- Only showed aggression with raises in hands 46 and 48\n- Made a flop bet in hand 43 after calling preflop\n- Called preflop in hand 43 then bet on flop\n- The call in this hand suggests they might have something decent\n\n**Position:**\nI'm out of position (BB) vs the button (seat 4). This is a disadvantage.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI'm at 16.9 BB which is still in the playable range but getting short. I should be selective with my hands.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nThe pot is 20 and it costs me 0 to check, so infinite pot odds to see the flop. But the real cost is the risk of losing more chips post-flop with a weak hand.\n\n**Decision:**\nWith 8s 3d, I have almost no chance of making a strong hand. Even though it's free to check, I'll be out of position against a tight player who called from the button. This suggests they have a decent hand. \n\nWith my tournament life at stake and a shortish stack, I should not invest any more chips in this pot with such a weak hand. The risk of getting trapped and losing more chips post-flop outweighs the benefit of seeing a free flop.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. Since the amount to call is 0, I can check and see the flop for free. The pot is 20 chips (8 from me, 4 from SB, 8 from MiniMax). \n\nHowever, with 8-3 offsuit, I'm very likely to be dominated even if I hit something. And I'll be out of position. The best case scenario is hitting two pair or trips, which is very unlikely (around 2% chance). \n\nGiven that MiniMax is tight and called from the button, they likely have a decent hand. If I check and hit any 8 or 3, I'll still be unsure if I'm ahead. This could lead to difficult decisions out of position.\n\nI think the disciplined play here is to fold. Even though it's \"free\" to see the flop, playing 8-3 offsuit out of position against a tight player is -EV. I should preserve my 135 chips for better spots.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider again. The pot is 20 chips and I already have 8 chips invested. If I fold, I lose those 8 chips for sure. If I check, I get to see if I can realize some equity. \n\nLet me think about the math. With 8-3 offsuit:\n- Probability of flopping a pair: ~26% (but could be dominated)\n- Probability of flopping two pair: ~2%\n- Probability of flopping trips: ~1.35%\n\nSo about 29% chance I'll flop something that looks good, but most of those times I'll have just a weak pair that could be dominated.\n\nGiven the opponent is tight and I'm out of position, I think checking to see the flop is actually fine. It's zero additional risk, and while I have very little equity, there's always a tiny chance I could hit big or bluff on certain board textures.\n\nBut actually, the more I think about it, the more I lean towards folding. With a tight player calling from the button, they have a real hand. With 8-3 offsuit and being out of position, even if I flop a pair of 8s, I'm likely behind their range which includes all better 8s, all pairs, etc. \n\nThis is a clear fold to preserve my tournament stack. I don't want to get into a difficult spot out of position with a weak hand against a tight player.\n\nWait, I'm confusing myself. Let me be clear:\n- Amount to call is 0\n- I can check for free\n- But I have the option to fold\n\nIn poker, you never fold when you can check for free. That would be burning equity, no matter how small. Even with 8-3 offsuit, I have some chance (however small) of hitting a disguised big hand or being able to bluff"

I don't want to get into a difficult spot out of position with a weak hand against a tight player.\n\nWait, I'm confusing myself. Let me be clear:\n- Amount to call is 0\n- I can check for free\n- But I have the option to fold\n\nIn poker, you never fold when you can check for free. That would be burning equity, no matter how small. Even with 8-3 offsuit, I have some chance (however small) of hitting a disguised big hand or being able to bluff",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in BB (Seat 1) with 8s 3d\n- My stack: 135 chips (16.9 BB)\n- Board: Jd 6d 6c (two diamonds, two sixes, and a Jack)\n- Pot: 20 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nMy hand is 8s 3d - this is a very weak hand. On this board:\n- I have no pair (8 high)\n- No flush draw (only one spade, one diamond)\n- No straight draw (no connection)\n- The board has two sixes and a Jack\n\n**Opponent:**\nOnly Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is still in the hand. They called preflop from what position? Let me check the preflop actions:\n- Seat 5 posted SB\n- I posted BB\n- Seat 2 folded\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 4 called 8 (from what position?)\n- Seat 5 folded\n- I checked\n\nSo Seat 4 is the only opponent. They called from what would be the button or cutoff position (since seats 2 and 3 folded, and seat 5 is SB). They have 275 chips (34.4 BB).\n\n**Decision:**\nI have absolutely nothing. The board is paired (6s), and my 8 high is very weak. I should check and see what the opponent does. If they bet, I'll almost certainly fold unless it's a very small bet and I have good odds (which is unlikely).\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools here because:\n1. The situation is very straightforward - I have a terrible hand\n2. I have no draws, no pair, nothing to continue with\n3. Checking is the obvious play\n\nI should check and see what my opponent does on the flop.",

They called preflop this hand but checked both flop and turn, suggesting they likely have a marginal hand or are trapping.\n\n**Action:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (it's checked to me)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\nWith 8 high on a board with two pairs (6s and J/Q), I have absolutely nothing. Checking is free, so I should check and see the river. There's no value in betting here as MiniMax-M2 would only call/raise with better hands. \n\nHowever, I could consider a bluff given that:\n1. The board is paired (6s), which can scare opponents\n\n\n2. I have a tight table image that might intimidate opponents\n3. A small bet could potentially steal the pot\n4. My stack size allows for a strategic move\n\nI'm weighing the risks of a potential bluff against the safety of checking. A strategic check seems most prudent given my weak hand and the potential for my opponent to have a stronger holding. The minimal pot size doesn't justify an aggressive move, so I'll cautiously check and hope for a favorable river card.",

I have no pair, no draw, nothing.\n\n**Board**: Jd 6d 6c Qd\n- There are two 6s on board (paired board)\n- Three diamonds (Jd, 6d, Qd) - flush draw possible\n- Straight possibilities with Q-J\n\n**Position**: I'm in BB, out of position against MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4.\n\n**Stack**: 135 chips (16.9 BB) - This is a short stack but not desperate yet.\n\n**Pot**: 28 chips\n- Preflop: SB 4 + BB 8 + call 8 = 20\n- Turn bet: 8 more, so 28 total\n\n**Action**: MiniMax-M2 bet 8 on the turn after we both checked the flop.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- Very tight preflop player (folded many hands)\n- Made a river bet in hand 37\n- Made a flop bet in hand 43\n- Made preflop raises in hands 46 and 48\n\nThis player seems to be tight-aggressive when they do play. The turn bet on this board suggests they likely have something. Given the board texture, they could have:\n- A flush (if they have diamonds)\n- A full house (if they have a 6)\n- A straight draw\n- Top pair with J or Q\n- Or they could be bluffing with the flush draw\n\n**My situation**: I have absolutely nothing. 8-high with no draw. The pot is 28 and I need to call 8, giving me 3.5:1 pot odds. But even with these odds, I have essentially 0% chance of winning this hand. I have no outs.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 16.9 BB, I'm short-stacked but not in desperation mode. I should preserve my chips for better spots. Calling here would be burning 8 chips (0.6 BB) with no chance of winning.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. I have no hand, no draw, and I'm facing a bet from a tight player. I need to preserve my stack for better opportunities.",

In a tournament with a short stack (16.4 BB), this is definitely a raise-worthy hand. I should be looking to either:\n1. Take down the blinds preflop\n2. Build a pot with a strong hand\n3. Potentially get all-in if the situation is right\n\nGiven my short stack, I should be playing aggressively with decent hands. Pocket sixes heads-up from the button is a premium spot.\n\nThe minimum raise is 16 chips (2x the BB). With 131 chips, a standard raise would be to about 2.5-3x BB = 20-24 chips. This is a good spot to raise to 24 (3x BB) to put pressure on the BB.\n\nLet me make a raise to 24 chips.",

With this stack size and a premium hand, I should be looking to get my chips in\n4. **Opponents**: Only SB and BB left to act. Both have decent stacks (157 and 123 chips respectively)\n5. **Action**: Everyone else has folded\n\n**Decision rationale:**\nWith AK on the button and a stack of <10 BB, this is a clear shove (all-in) situation. I want to maximize fold equity and when called, I'll have good equity against most ranges. \n\nIf I just call or make a small raise, I risk:\n- Missing value when I hit the flop\n- Letting the blinds see a cheap flop with speculative hands\n- Having to fold if I miss and they bet\n\nThe standard play with <10 BB and AK is to shove preflop. This gives me:\n- Maximum fold equity\n- Good equity when called (against any pair I'm roughly 45-50%, against weaker aces I'm dominating)\n- No tough post-flop decisions with a short stack\n\nI should raise to my full stack of 143 chips (all-in).",

The players behind me have been folding frequently in recent hands.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 10.4 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My situation:**\n- Position: UTG (first to act)\n- Cards: 9d 4c (very weak hand)\n- Stack: 167 chips (10.4 BB) - getting short\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n9d 4c is a terrible hand. It's not suited, not connected, and the 9 is a weak high card. This is definitely a folding hand, especially from UTG position.\n\n**Position considerations:**\nI'm UTG, the worst position. I have to act first on every street. Playing weak hands from UTG is a recipe for disaster.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 10.4 BB, which is getting short but not desperate yet. I need to be selective and wait for good spots to shove or make moves. This is NOT a good spot.\n\n**Opponent tendencies (from the data):**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been folding a lot preflop, but occasionally raises. Made a big raise of 157 chips in hand #62.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Very tight - folded every preflop in the last 10 hands recorded.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Generally tight, but did call once and made a small bet on turn in hand #59.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Mixed - some folds, one call. Generally seems to be playing straightforward.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 9-4 offsuit is in the bottom 10% of hands. From UTG with a short-ish stack, this is an easy fold. I need to preserve my chips for better spots, preferably when I'm in better position or have a stronger hand.\n\nThe pot odds are 16 to win 24 (1.5:1), but with this hand, even those odds don't justify calling. If I call, I'd be out of position with a very weak hand, and would likely have to fold to any aggression on later streets.\n \nI recognize the urgency of my dwindling chip stack, but this hand is clearly not worth the risk. Tournament survival demands patience and strategic chip preservation. I'll wait for a stronger hand or better position to make a move.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - This is good position\n- Cards: 5c Td (5 of clubs, 10 of diamonds) - This is offsuit, gap hand. Not very strong.\n- Stack: 151 chips (9.4 BB) - Short stacked\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- Action: SB (Seat 5) posted 8 and called the additional 8 to complete to 16\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nLooking at their recent history:\n- Very tight player - mostly folding (hands 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63)\n- Only called once (hand 54) and then folded\n- Only raised once (hand 45) with amount 24\n- This player is in SB position and just called to complete\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 5c Td is a weak hand, especially offsuit with a 5-gap\n- On the button, we have position advantage\n- We're short stacked with 9.4 BB\n- The opponent is very tight and just limped from SB\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak, but we have position\n2. **Stack size**: Short at 9.4 BB - we need to be careful but also look for spots to accumulate\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight player who limped - this suggests they don't have a premium hand\n4. **Pot odds**: There's 32 in pot, it costs us 0 to check. If we raise, minimum is 32.\n5. **Tournament**: With 9.4 BB, we need to preserve our stack but also can't be too passive\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Check**: Free flop with a weak hand in position. We can see if we hit something. \n2. **Raise**: Minimum raise to 32 (2x BB). This would be about 21% of our stack. Given how tight opponent is, a raise might take it down preflop. But if they call, we're out of position post-flop with a weak hand.\n\n**Recommendation**: Check. Here's why:\n- Our hand is too weak to invest 21% of our short stack\n- We have position, so we can see a free flop\n- The opponent is tight, so if we hit something decent, we might get value\n- If we miss, we can easily fold with minimal loss\n- Raising with this hand commits too much of our stack with poor equity\n\nLet me check what the minimum raise is again. It says \"Minimum raise to: 32\". Since the big blind is 16, a minimum raise would be to 32 total (an additional 16). That would be 32 chips from our 151 stack, which is about 21% of our stack. That's too much for this weak hand.\n\nChecking is the correct play here.",

I have no hand, no draw, facing a large bet from a tight player, and calling would decimate my stack.

This is critical. With less than 10 big blinds, I need to be much more selective about which hands I play. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call raises with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Action**: Everyone folded to me on the button. I only need to call 8 chips (0.5 BB) to see the flop. The small blind is already posted.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: There's 24 chips in the pot and I need to call 8, giving me 3:1 pot odds.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 8.9 BB, I should be in push/fold mode. Calling with a weak hand like J4o is -EV. If I call and miss the flop (which is likely), I'll have wasted 8 chips and be in a tough spot postflop. If I raise, I'd need to make it at least 32 chips, which commits over 20% of my stack with a terrible hand.\n\nThe correct play here is to fold. I need to preserve my chips for better spots, preferably when I have a stronger hand and can shove preflop. J4o is not worth playing even from the button with this stack size.",

This suggests they have a strong hand.\n\nMy hand is Q\u2665J\u2665 - suited connectors, which is a decent hand but not premium. I'm on the button, which is good position. However, I only have 143 chips (8.9 BB), so I'm in short stack territory.\n\nLet me think about this:\n- Pot is 72, I need to call 48\n- This gives me pot odds of 72:48 or 1.5:1\n- If I call, I'll have 95 chips left (5.9 BB)\n- If I raise, minimum is 80, which would leave me with 63 chips\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 has been very tight and is now raising from early position, they likely have a strong range (AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe JJ, TT, AQ). My QJs is behind most of that range.\n\nWith my short stack, I should be looking for spots to either:\n1. Shove all-in with a strong hand\n2. Fold marginal hands and preserve chips\n\nQJs is marginal against a tight early position raiser. If I call, I'll be out of position postflop (well, I'll be in position on the button, but with only 5.9 BB left, I'm basically committed if I hit anything).\n\nActually wait - I'm ON THE BUTTON (Seat 1), so I have position. That helps. But still, with 8.9 BB, I need to be careful.\n\nLet me reconsider the pot odds. Pot is 72, I need to call 48. That's 72:48 = 1.5:1. I need 40% equity to call. Against a tight EP range (AA-QQ, AK, maybe JJ), QJs has about 35-40% equity. It's close.\n\nBut tournament equity matters too. If I lose this hand, I'm down to 95 chips (5.9 BB). If I win, I go up to 191 chips (11.9 BB).\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot and now raises, this is likely a strong hand. \n\nI'm facing a tough decision with Q\u2665J\u2665. The raiser's tight play suggests a strong hand, and my stack size makes this a critical moment. The pot odds are marginal, and calling would significantly reduce my remaining chips. While the suited connectors have some potential, the risk of losing a substantial portion of my stack outweighs the potential upside. I need to preserve my tournament life and wait for a more favorable opportunity.",

It's not strong enough to raise with from early position with a short stack\n2. **Position:** UTG is the worst position - I'll be acting first on all postflop streets\n3. **Stack size:** 8.9 BB is short. I need to be careful about committing chips\n4. **Tournament situation:** With <10 BB, I'm in \"shove or fold\" territory or looking for spots to accumulate chips\n5. **Opponent tendencies:** From the recall data, I can see:\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has made big raises (157 chips in hand 62)\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) made an all-in raise (115 chips in hand 63)\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has made raises (48 chips in hand 66)\n   - Players are active and willing to raise\n\n**Decision:** From UTG with QTo and 8.9 BB, this is a clear fold. \n- The hand is too weak to raise from UTG\n- Calling 1 BB (16 chips) would commit over 11% of my stack with a marginal hand\n- I'm likely dominated by better hands (AQ, KQ, AT, KT, etc.)\n- I don't have enough chips to play this hand profitably postflop\n- I need to preserve my stack for better spots, preferably in late position or with premium hands\n\nEven though I'm short-stacked (8.9 BB), QTo from UTG is not a good enough hand to commit chips with.

It's weak kicker with the ace, and the 4 doesn't help much. The suitedness gives some flush potential but it's still a weak hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. I'll be out of position against everyone else for the entire hand. This significantly reduces the playability of marginal hands.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 143 chips which is 8.9 BB. This is a short stack in tournament play. With a short stack, I should be looking to either:\n   - Fold marginal hands to preserve my stack\n   - Shove all-in with strong hands to avoid post-flop play and maximize fold equity\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With only 8.9 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I shouldn't be making standard raises with marginal hands from early position. If I play this hand, I should either fold or shove all-in.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: I don't have specific reads on these opponents yet, but with a short stack, my primary concern should be hand selection and position.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 24 and I need to call 16, giving me 1.5:1 odds. But this is irrelevant because I shouldn't be calling with this hand from this position with my stack size.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold. A4 suited is too weak to play from UTG with a short stack. If I were to play it, I should shove all-in (143 chips), but that's too aggressive for this weak hand. The correct play is to fold and wait for a better spot, preferably with a stronger hand or better position.\n\nLet me make the fold decision:",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- My position: BB (Seat 1)\n- My cards: 8d Tc (offsuit, mediocre hand)\n- My stack: 127 chips (7.9 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 138 chips\n- Amount to call: 90 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n1. **Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)** - Short stack (8 chips, then raised to 106):\n   - Recent actions show they fold frequently but when they put chips in, they commit\n   - Hand 64: Called 8, then bet 80 on flop\n   - Hand 68: Called 64, bet 64 on flop, folded on turn\n   - They seem to be getting desperate with a short stack and making aggressive moves\n   - This raise to 106 is essentially all-in (they only have 8 chips left, so they're committing their entire stack)\n\n2. **Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)** - Big stack (402 chips):\n   - Just called 16 preflop, showing some interest but not aggression\n   - Recent history shows they play a mix of hands, sometimes folding, sometimes raising\n   - Hand 68 showed them calling and betting aggressively with a strong hand (Ad Jc)\n\n**Hand Strength Analysis:**\n- 8d Tc is a weak offsuit hand with poor connectivity\n- Against a short stack shove from Seat 5, we're likely facing a wide range but still behind most of it\n- Even against a random hand, T8o is only about 45-50% equity\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 138 chips\n- Need to call 90 chips\n- Pot odds: 138:90 or about 1.53:1\n- This means we need ~39.5% equity to break even on the call\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 127 chips (7.9 BB), which is getting short but not desperate yet\n- Calling here would leave me with only 37 chips if I lose (2.3 BB)\n- The short stack (Seat 5) is likely shoving wide, but even so, T8o is marginal\n- Seat 4 is still in the hand and could have a strong hand\n- If I fold, I preserve my 127 chips and can look for better spots\n\n**Decision:**\nDespite the decent pot odds, T8o is just too weak to call off 71% of my stack. The short stack could be shoving with any ace, any pair, or decent broadway cards, all of which have me dominated or flipping at best. I should preserve my stack for a better spot where I can be the aggressor or have better equity.\n\nI need to fold here.",

Folded 8 out of 10 recent hands preflop, only raised once (shoved 157 chips)\n- BB (Seat 4): No data yet, but has 288 chips (18 BB)\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 5h4h is a weak hand. It's suited but very low. Not a premium hand.\n\n2. **Stack size**: With only 7.4 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I should either fold or shove all-in. Calling 16 chips (13.4% of my stack) with this weak hand is not good.\n\n3. **Position**: Being on the button is good, but with such a short stack, position matters less.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: SB is very tight, BB is unknown but likely to defend their blind.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I'd be calling 16 to win 24 (1.5:1), which is not enough for this weak hand.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 7.4 BB, I need to be selective. 54s is not strong enough to shove here, especially with a tight SB who might wake up with a hand.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This hand is too weak to risk 13.4% of my stack, and I should wait for a better spot with a stronger hand or better position when I can shove all-in.",

I need to be very careful with my chips.\n\n**Pot**: 24 chips\n**To call**: 8 chips\n**Minimum raise**: 32 chips\n\n**Opponent information**: Looking at the recall data for the BB (Seat 2):\n- They've been very tight, folding most hands (hands 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 71, 73)\n- They raised twice: hand 62 with a big raise of 157 (likely all-in or close to it) and hand 72 with 40\n- They showed down Kd 9h in hand 30, which is a marginal hand\n\nThe opponent seems to be playing tight overall, which makes sense given tournament dynamics.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: J4o is one of the worst hands in poker. It has very little potential.\n2. **Stack size**: At 7.4 BB, I need to preserve my chips for better spots. I cannot afford to waste 8 chips (0.5 BB) on a marginal call.\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, getting 3:1 odds. While this might seem okay, J4o will rarely hit a strong enough hand to justify the investment.\n4. **Position**: Even on the button, J4o is too weak to play profitably.\n5. **Opponent tendency**: The BB is tight, which means if I call and they bet postflop, I'll likely be forced to fold.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With a short stack of 7.4 BB, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold. Calling with a weak hand like J4o is not optimal. I should either:\n- Fold and wait for a better hand/spot\n- Consider raising if I want to steal, but the min raise is 32 chips (27% of my stack), which is too much to risk with J4o\n\nThe correct play here is to fold. I need to preserve my chips for better opportunities where I have stronger hands or better situations (like being the first to act in late position with a marginal hand I can shove).\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"J4o is too weak to play with a short stack of 7.4 BB.

I need to be very selective about when I commit chips.\n\n**Blinds**: 8/16 - The blinds are significant relative to my stack.\n\n**Pot**: 24 chips (1.5 BB)\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 has been active with raises, including some big ones (157, 40, 48). They seem aggressive.\n- Seat 4 (BB): MiniMax-M2 has also been raising, with amounts ranging from 4 to 48 chips. They also seem aggressive and have shown down strong hands like pocket 8s, AJ, and JTs.\n\n**Action**: \n- SB posted 8\n- BB posted 16\n- Seat 5 folded\n- It's on me (BTN) with 16 to call\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 3d9d is extremely weak. Even with the diamond suit, this is a fold 99%+ of the time.\n2. **Stack size**: With only 7.4 BB, I cannot afford to waste chips on marginal hands. I need to preserve my stack for better spots.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents in the blinds have shown aggression. If I call, I'm likely facing a raise from one or both of them.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1). With my hand, this is not enough.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a short stack, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold. Calling with a weak hand and being out of position post-flop is a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe only consideration could be if I want to try a steal, but with my hand being so weak and both opponents showing aggression, a steal attempt would be ill-advised. Even if I raise, I'd have to raise to at least 32 (2x BB), which would commit over 25% of my stack with a trash hand.\n\n**Decision**: Fold.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Qd Ac - This is a strong starting hand, especially in early position. Ace-Queen offsuit is definitely playable.\n\n2. **My position**: UTG (Seat 1) - This is the worst position preflop since I'm first to act. Playing from UTG requires stronger hands.\n\n3. **My stack**: 119 chips (7.4 BB) - I'm in the short stack territory. With less than 10 big blinds, I'm in push/fold territory, but I have enough chips to make a standard raise.\n\n4. **Opponents**:\n   - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (205 chips) - Recent actions show mostly folding, but did raise to 40 in hand 72\n   - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (304 chips) - Recent actions show mostly folding, called 90 in hand 69\n   - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B (188 chips) - Recent actions show mostly folding\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1) - not great immediate odds, but with a strong hand like AQ, this is a clear call or raise.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 7.4 BB, I need to be thinking about survival but also chip accumulation. AQ from UTG is strong enough to play, but I need to be careful.\n\nGiven that I'm UTG with a short stack (7.4 BB), I have a few options:\n- **Fold**: Too tight with AQ. This is a premium hand in this situation.\n- **Call**: Could be okay, but being out of position with a short stack is problematic. If I just call and miss the flop, I'm in a tough spot.\n- **Raise**: The standard play. With 7.4 BB, I should either shove all-in or make a standard raise.\n\nLooking at the raise sizing: Minimum raise is 32 (to 48 total). If I raise to 32, that would leave me with 87 chips. If I get called and miss the flop, I'll be in an awkward spot.\n\nWith 7.4 BB and AQ from UTG, the correct tournament play is often to shove all-in. This achieves several things:\n1. Maximizes fold equity\n2. Avoids difficult post-flop decisions out of position\n3. Gets maximum value when called by weaker hands\n4. Puts pressure on the bigger stacks\n\nThe opponents have been folding a lot preflop recently, so there's good fold equity. Even if I get called, AQ is in good shape against most calling ranges from the big stacks.\n\nLet me go all-in for 119 chips.",

In hand 78, they raised preflop to 32 and then made a big raise on the flop to 148. Their showdowns show they play reasonable hands (AdJs, 7cJs, 5hQh).\n\n**My situation**: \n- I have a small pocket pair with 7.4 BB left\n- I'm getting pot odds: 48 to win 72 = 1.5:1, which is not great for a small pair\n- With a small pair, I'm usually flipping against overcards (50/50) or dominated against higher pairs (20/80)\n- I need to get lucky and hit a set to have a strong hand\n- If I call 48, I'll have 71 chips left (4.4 BB)\n- If I raise all-in to 119, I'm risking my tournament life with a marginal hand\n- The raiser has been tight, suggesting they likely have a strong hand range\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \nWith only 7.4 BB, I need to make a move soon, but 44 is not a great hand to do it with. I should wait for a better spot, preferably with a hand that has better equity against a tight raiser's range, or when I'm first to act.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. I don't have the odds to call, and going all-in with 44 against a tight player who just raised 3x is -EV. I should preserve my chips for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm UTG (Seat 1) with K9o (9h Kd)\n- My stack: 119 chips (7.4 BB) - I'm short-stacked\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- K9o is a marginal hand, especially from UTG position\n- It's off-suit and has a big gap, making it vulnerable\n- From UTG, this is typically a fold in most situations\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm short-stacked with only 7.4 BB\n- At this stack depth, I need to be looking for spots to shove or fold\n- K9o is not strong enough to open-shove from UTG with 7.4 BB\n- The players behind me have deeper stacks (205, 192, 300 chips)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (from recent hands):**\nLooking at the opponent actions:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been folding a lot preflop, but did raise to 48 in hand 77\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Mixed play - folds often but called and bet in hand 78\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been raising preflop (hands 78, 79) and seems aggressive\n\n**Decision:**\nFrom UTG with K9o and a short stack, this is a clear fold. The hand is too weak to risk 13% of my stack (16/119) when I'll be out of position post-flop against players who have shown they can raise preflop. I need to preserve my chips for a better spot, preferably with a stronger hand or better position.",

This is a standard tournament play with a short stack and a premium hand. I want to maximize fold equity and get value from my strong hand. Even if called, AK has good equity against most calling ranges.\n\nThe minimum raise is 64, and I can raise to my full stack of 87 (all-in).",

This is a very strong hand given the board texture. There's a flush draw on the flop (Js Ks 3h) but the 3d on the turn doesn't complete it. No straight draws are obvious.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, I can see GPT-OSS-120B:\n   - Has been fairly tight (folded many hands preflop)\n   - When they do play, they can be aggressive (raised 106 in hand 69, raised 148 on flop in hand 78)\n   - In hand 68, they bet 64 on flop then folded on turn\n   - In hand 69, they checked turn then called a small bet (8)\n   - They check-folded to my 87 chip raise preflop in this hand, then called 55 more\n\n4. **Action analysis**: \n   - Preflop: I raised to 87, opponent called 55 (showing some strength)\n   - Flop: I checked, opponent checked (showing some caution)\n   - Turn: Opponent checked to me\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: I only have 32 chips left which is exactly 1 BB. This is a critical tournament situation - I'm extremely short-stacked. The pot is already 174 chips, which is massive relative to my stack.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: If I bet my remaining 32 chips, I'm betting into a 174 chip pot. This is an easy decision.\n\n**Decision**: I should definitely check here. Here's why:\n- I'm extremely short-stacked (1 BB) and need to be very careful\n- My hand is strong (top pair, top kicker with two pair on board)\n- The opponent has shown caution by checking turn\n- If I bet my remaining 32 chips, I risk being called by better hands\n- Checking gives me a chance to see the river for free and potentially win at showdown\n- Given my tiny stack relative to the pot, preserving chips is crucial\n\nI should check and hope to get to showdown with my strong hand.",

Let me analyze this:\n\nMy hand: Kc Ac\nBoard: Js Ks 3h 3d 5h\n\nThis gives me two pair, Kings and Threes, with an Ace kicker. \n\nPot: 174 chips\nMy stack: 32 chips (1.0 BB)\nOpponent (Seat 5 GPT-OSS-120B): 213 chips\n\nThe action sequence shows:\n- Preflop: I raised to 87, opponent called 55 (so they invested significant chips)\n- Flop: Opponent checked, I checked\n- Turn: Opponent checked, I checked  \n- River: Opponent checked\n\nNow it's on me to act with 0 to call. My legal actions are fold or check.\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Hand strength: I have two pair (Kings and Threes) with Ace kicker. This is a strong hand, but the board has some dangers:\n   - Flush draw was possible (two spades on flop: Js Ks)\n   - Straight draw was possible (but unlikely with this board)\n   - Full house is possible if opponent has a 3 (trips)\n   - Better two pair is possible if opponent has KJ\n\n2. Given that opponent called my preflop raise of 87 chips, they likely have something decent. The fact that they've checked all streets suggests they might be weak, but they could also be slow-playing a strong hand.\n\n3. My stack is only 32 chips left (1 BB), which is extremely short. The pot is 174 chips.\n\n4. If I check, I get to showdown for free and potentially win 174 chips with my two pair.\n\n5. If I bet (I could shove my remaining 32 chips), I might get called by worse hands or get folds from hands that might beat me.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have a strong but vulnerable hand\n- My stack is extremely short (1 BB)\n- The opponent has shown weakness by checking all streets\n- I have 0 to call so I can see showdown for free\n\nThe safe and correct play here is to check and go to showdown. There's no value in betting my last 32 chips when I can see the showdown for free, especially since my hand is strong but not the nuts. Checking preserves my chance to win the 174 chip pot without risking my remaining stack.\n\nI should check.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 7s Qc - This is a marginal hand, offsuit and not connected. Q7o is generally a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. This is a significant advantage.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 190 chips (5.9 BB) - This is very short stacked, nearing the critical zone. We're in tournament play where survival matters.\n\n4. **Current action**: \n   - I posted SB (16)\n   - BB posted 32\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 32\n   - Seat 5 folded\n   - I need to call 16 more to see the flop\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 80 chips, I need to call 16. That's 5:1 pot odds. This is very attractive pot odds.\n\n6. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n   - Very tight player - folded preflop in 7 of last 10 hands\n   - When they did play (hand 78), they called preflop and then bet on the flop\n   - They seem to play straightforwardly - tight preflop, aggressive when they hit\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With only 5.9 BB, I need to be very careful. However, I'm getting 5:1 pot odds on my call, and I'm in position. The call is only 16 chips, which is about 8% of my stack. Even though Q7o is weak, the combination of position, pot odds, and the fact that MiniMax-M2 seems tight makes this a borderline call.\n\n8. **Strategic thinking**: \n   - If I call, I have position post-flop\n   - MiniMax-M2 likely has a decent but not premium hand (they called, didn't raise)\n   - I can easily fold if I miss the flop\n   - The investment is small relative to pot size\n   - However, with my short stack, I should be looking for better spots to get my money in\n\n9. **Decision**: While the pot odds are good and I have position, Q7o is just too weak, especially with my short stack. I should preserve my chips for a better spot where I can shove or make a stand with a stronger hand. The 16 chips represent about 8% of my stack, which isn't huge, but tournament survival is key here.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The pot odds are 5:1, I'm on the button, and it's only costing me 16 chips (8% of stack). If I hit a Q on the flop, I could be good against a tight player who might have weaker Qx or be overplaying a medium pair. Plus, I can easily fold if I miss. The combination of position and pot odds might make this a profitable call.\n\nBut wait - with 5.9 BB, I should be thinking about push/fold. Calling with marginal hands like this can lead to difficult post-flop situations where I bleed chips. The standard play with <10 BB is to either shove or fold preflop, not call.\n\nHowever, since I already have 16 invested as the SB, and I only need to call 16 more to win 80, that's excellent pot odds. This is a special situation because of the posted blind.\n\nLet me think about this differently: if I had 0 invested and it folded to me on the BTN with Q7o and 5.9 BB, I should fold. But I've already invested 16 chips (the SB). \n\nI realize the SB is a sunk cost. Tournament ICM considerations are crucial here. With extremely short stacks, every chip matters. Despite the tempting pot odds, my marginal hand and vulnerable position make folding the most prudent choice. The potential to lose more chips outweighs the slim chance of winning this hand.",

This looks like a strong hand trying to isolate or protect against the short-stacked BB.\n\nThe decision is clear: FOLD. This hand is not worth 149 chips (62.6% of my stack) with J8 offsuit.

At this stack depth, it's either shove or fold, and the combination of position and opponent tendencies makes this a profitable shove.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - this is the best position postflop\n- Cards: 9h Ac (Ace-nine offsuit)\n- Stack: 238 chips (7.4 BB) - I'm short-stacked\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- To call: 32 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - 133 chips (short stack), posted SB\n- Seat 4 (BB): MiniMax-M2 - 208 chips, posted BB\n- Seat 5 folded\n\nFrom the recall data:\n- **Kimi-K2 (SB)**: Folding a lot preflop (folded 8 of last 10 hands), only raised once. Seems tight/passive. Only showdown was K9o making two pair.\n\n- **MiniMax-M2 (BB)**: Also folding a lot preflop, but when they call (hand 82, 84), they bet aggressively on the flop. Showdowns show they play hands like JTc, AJ, and 88. Seems to defend their blind but then leads out aggressively.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Ace-nine offsuit is a marginal hand, especially with a 9 kicker. It's dominated by many Ax hands.\n\n2. **Position**: Button is great postflop, but with only 7.4 BB, we're looking for spots to either shove or fold.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I'm short at 7.4 BB. The SB is even shorter at 4.2 BB. The BB has 6.5 BB.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: At this stack depth, I should be looking to either fold or shove (push all-in). A standard raise would commit too much of my stack.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: SB is tight and folds a lot. BB defends but then bets aggressively postflop, which could be problematic with Ace-high.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nWith Ace-nine on the button and 7.4 BB, this is a borderline hand. However:\n- The SB is very tight and likely to fold to pressure\n- The BB defends but then leads out aggressively, making it hard to play Ace-high postflop\n\n\n- I have position, which is valuable\n- The pot is 48 and I need to call 32, giving me 1.5:1 immediate odds\n\nI see a clear opportunity to apply maximum pressure. Shoving all-in creates fold equity against the tight SB and potentially the BB. With my short stack, this move maximizes my chances of winning the blinds and antes. The aggressive BB might be forced to fold marginal hands, and my position gives me an additional edge. This is a classic short-stack tournament play that could significantly boost my chip count.\n\nThe key is leveraging my positional advantage and the opponents' tendencies to create a high-pressure situation that favors my current stack size. A shove represents strength and could extract folds from both opponents.",

Very low equity against any reasonable calling range.\n2. **Position**: Good position (button), but with such a weak hand this doesn't help much\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight player. If I call and they check, I might steal on some flops, but if they bet, I'm folding.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 48, getting 3:1 odds. This is actually decent odds, but with 65o, I'm rarely good.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 8.9 BB, I should be looking for better spots to get my chips in. This is not a profitable spot.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This hand is just too weak, even with good position and decent pot odds. I need to preserve my stack for better opportunities, especially against a tight opponent who will likely have me dominated even when I hit something.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Ad Qh (Ace-Queen offsuit) - This is a strong starting hand, especially in late position. From UTG it's still playable but requires caution.\n\n**My Stack**: 286 chips (8.9 BB) - This is a short stack. I need to be thinking about survival and looking for spots to accumulate chips.\n\n**Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position. I have to act first post-flop.\n\n**Blinds**: 16/32 - The blinds are quite high relative to stacks.\n\n**Pot**: 48 chips\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): 181 chips (5.7 BB) - very short\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 192 chips (6 BB) - short\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 133 chips (4.2 BB) - very short\n\nLooking at the opponent action history:\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, BB) has been folding a lot preflop. In hand 86 they made a big raise of 165 (which would be all-in for them now). They seem to play tight but can make moves.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB) has been folding a lot preflop, very tight.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has also been folding a lot, but made a raise to 133 in hand 88.\n\nGiven I'm UTG with a short stack (8.9 BB), I need to think about tournament survival. AQ is a strong hand but from early position with a short stack, I have a few options:\n\n1. **Fold**: Too tight with AQ and only 8.9 BB. I need to accumulate chips.\n2. **Call (32 chips)**: This would leave me with 254 chips (7.9 BB). The problem is I'll be out of position post-flop, which is bad with AQ.\n3. **Raise**: With 8.9 BB, I should either go all-in or make a standard raise.\n\nGiven my stack size and the fact that I'm UTG, this is actually a good spot to go all-in. Here's why:\n- I have a strong hand (AQ)\n- My stack is short enough that I don't have post-flop playability anyway\n- Going all-in creates maximum fold equity against the short stacks behind me\n- The players behind me have shown tendencies to fold preflop\n- I need to accumulate chips to survive\n\nThe players in the blinds are very short:\n- SB has 192 chips (6 BB)\n- BB has 133 chips (4.2 BB)\n\nIf I go all-in for 286 chips:\n- The BB would need to call 254 more into a pot of 334 (48+286), getting about 1.3:1 odds\n- The SB would need to call 270 more into a pot of 318, getting about 1.2:1 odds\n\nBoth would be getting poor odds to call with marginal hands.\n\nThis is a classic short-stack push/fold spot. From UTG with AQ and ~9 BB, this is a clear all-in.",

With 77, I need to consider:\n\n**If I call 48**: \n- I'll have 73 chips left (2.3 BB)\n- Pot will be 160 chips\n- I'll be out of position postflop\n- If I don't hit a set (which is 12% chance), I'm in trouble\n\n**If I raise**: \n- Minimum raise to 96, which leaves me 25 chips\n- This is basically committing my stack\n- Could shove all-in for 121\n\n**If I fold**:\n- I lose 16 chips from SB\n- I have 105 chips left (3.3 BB)\n\nWith a short stack of under 4 BB, pocket sevens is actually a strong hand. The raiser has been folding a lot, suggesting they might be raising with a wide range. \n\nGiven my stack size and the pot odds:\n- Calling 48 to win 112 = 43% pot odds\n- 77 against a wide range has decent equity\n- I'm short stacked and need to make a move soon\n\nThe best play here is likely to **shove all-in**. Here's why:\n1. With 3.8 BB, I don't have room to play postflop poker\n2. 77 is a strong hand in this situation\n3. I have fold equity against the raiser\n4.

The pot is already 112, and I can win 64 from the raiser plus blinds\n \nI'll push my entire stack of 121 chips, capitalizing on my short-stack situation and the potential fold equity against the raiser.

The amount to call is 57, but I only have 16 chips. In poker, when facing a bet larger than your stack, you can call by going all-in for your remaining chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With such massive pot odds (22.7:1), I should call with almost any hand that has any chance of winning. Pocket 7s certainly qualifies. Even if the opponent has a Ten, I have 2 outs (the remaining 7s). Against an overpair, I have 2 outs. Against two overcards, I might be ahead.\n\nGiven that I'm extremely short stacked and getting incredible pot odds, I should call and hope my 7s hold up or improve. This is likely a +EV play given the pot odds.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. The pot is 363 and I have 16 left. If I call 16, the final pot would be 363 + 16 = 379. I'm risking 16 to win 363, which is 22.7:1. I need 4.2% equity.\n\nWith pocket 7s:\n- If opponent has a Ten: I'm ~8% to win (2 outs)\n- If opponent has an overpair: I'm ~8% to win (2 outs)\n- If opponent has two overcards: I'm ~50-70% to win\n- If opponent has a flush draw: I'm ~60% to win\n- If opponent has a straight draw: I'm ~60% to win\n\nGiven the opponent is tight, they're more likely to have a made hand (pair of Tens or better) than a draw.

I only need ~4.2% equity to break even.\n\n2. **Hand strength**: I have pocket 7s on a Th 2d 5h board. This is an underpair to the board.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 2 is very tight (folded preflop 8/10 times). They called a raise preflop and now bet on the flop. A tight player betting here likely has:\n   - A pair of Tens or better\n   - Possibly a strong draw\n\n4. **Equity**: Even against a strong range, my pocket 7s likely has more than 4.2% equity:\n   - Against a pair of Tens: ~8% (2 outs)\n   - Against two overcards: ~50-70%\n   - Against a flush draw: ~60%\n\n5. **Tournament situation**: I'm extremely short stacked at 0.5 BB.

Only raised once (133 chips) and called once (89 chips) in recent hands. At showdown, had Kd9h and Kd6h - playing weak Kings. Now extremely short stacked with 28 chips.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): Extremely tight, folding almost every hand preflop. Only showed down strong hands like AJ, JT, and pocket 8s.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 9h 5d is a terrible hand, unsuited and disconnected. One of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n2. **Stack size**: I'm short stacked at 8.6 BB, but not desperate yet. I should be selective with my shoves.\n\n3. **Opponent situation**: \n   - SB has only 28 chips and is very tight. They might shove or fold.\n   - BB is extremely tight and has 5 BB. They'll likely only call with premium hands.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 to win 48 (1.5:1), which is 40% equity needed. Even against two random hands, 95o has only about 30% equity.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 8.6 BB, I need to be careful but I'm not in push/fold mode yet. I should wait for a better spot.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. My hand is terrible, I'm not desperate enough to gamble with 95o, and both opponents are short-stacked and likely to shove if I just call. I should preserve my chips for a better opportunity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have Td 9h - a suited connector but not suited (different suits). This is a marginal hand, especially from early position (UTG).\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in UTG (Under the Gun), which is the worst position preflop. I have 5 players still to act behind me.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 274 chips = 8.6 BB. This is a short stack in tournament terms. With a stack this short, I need to be very selective about which hands I play.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the recall, I can see:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been folding a lot preflop\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been active, making raises and calls\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) is very short stacked with only 12 chips\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 32 chips to win a pot of 48 chips, which is 1.5:1 odds. This would require me to win ~40% of the time to break even.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With only 8.6 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. Playing marginal hands like T9o from early position is generally a losing play. I should be looking for spots to either shove with strong hands or fold and wait for better opportunities.\n\n7. **Action**: The blinds are 16/32, so calling 32 chips would cost me about 12% of my stack. If I call and miss the flop (which will happen most of the time), I'll be in a difficult spot with an even shorter stack.\n\n8. **Alternative**: Folding preserves my stack and allows me to wait for a better hand or position.\n\nGiven all these factors, especially my short stack size, poor position, and marginal hand strength, the correct play is to fold. T9o from UTG with 8.6 BB is simply not strong enough to justify the investment.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with Jc Th (Jack of clubs, Ten of hearts)\n- Stack: 242 chips (7.6 BB) - very short stacked\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- Opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) in SB position has called 16 (so they limped)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nJTs is a decent suited connector. From the BTN, it's a good hand to play, especially in a heads-up situation. It has good potential for straights and flushes.\n\n**Position & Stack:**\n- I'm on the BTN (best position)\n- I have a very short stack of only 7.6 BB\n- This is a critical stack size - I need to be looking for spots to shove or fold\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nLooking at their recent actions:\n- Very passive player - lots of folds and checks\n- They limped from SB this hand (called 16)\n- In hand 96, they checked down all streets\n- In hand 94, they raised to 64 then folded\n- In hand 86, they raised to 165 (probably all-in or close to it)\n- In hand 92, they called 133\n\nThis player seems passive and tends to fold to aggression. They limped from SB, which suggests weakness.\n\n**Decision:**\nWith a short stack of 7.6 BB and JTs on the BTN against a limper, this is a clear shove spot. \n\n1. **Fold equity**: Against a passive player who limps, I likely have good fold equity\n2. **Hand equity**: JTs has good equity against a typical limping range\n3. **Stack size**: At 7.6 BB, I need to accumulate chips or get eliminated\n4. **Position**: Being on the BTN is advantageous\n\nThe minimum raise is 64, but with my stack of 242, I should just shove all-in for 242. This puts maximum pressure on the opponent and gives me two ways to win: they fold, or they call and I have decent equity.\n\n\nI'll go all-in with my 242-chip stack, leveraging my position and the opponent's passive tendencies. This aggressive move maximizes my chances of either winning the pot immediately or having solid equity if called.",

Let me re-read...\n\nOh, I see: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out)\" - this means they're out of the hand, but the action shows \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 186\". This seems contradictory. Let me think about this...\n\nActually, looking at the opponent actions I just recalled, GPT-OSS-120B has been active in recent hands, so the \"0 chips (out)\" might be their current stack after posting blinds or something. But they just raised 186, which is a massive raise.\n\nThe raise is 186 chips. I have 290 total. The pot is 234. I need to call 186 to see a flop.\n\nWith 5h 2c, this is a terrible hand. Even in position, calling 186 chips (64% of my stack) with 52 offsuit is a clear fold. I'm getting pot odds of 234:186 or about 1.26:1, which is nowhere near enough for this hand.\n\nEven if I consider implied odds, 52 offsuit has almost no potential. The only way I win is if I hit a perfect flop like 5-5-2 or 5-2-X, which is extremely unlikely.\n\nLet me check if there are any ICM considerations. Seat 2 only has 36 chips (1.1 BB), so they're almost out. Seat 4 has 200 chips. I'm in 2nd place with 290 chips. But even with ICM considerations, calling with 52 offsuit for 64% of my stack is terrible.\n\nThis is a clear fold. I preserve my 9.1 BB stack and wait for a better spot.",

It's not suited, the kicker is terrible, and I have no connectivity. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI'm at 9.1 BB, which is short-stacked. In tournament play, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call with marginal hands. With A3o from UTG, this is definitely a fold situation.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the opponent actions I gathered:\n- GPT-OSS-120B made a big raise in hand 99 (186 chips) - seems aggressive\n- MiniMax-M2 tends to fold preflop or check postflop - seems passive\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2) is very short with only 36 chips (1.1 BB) - likely to shove soon\n\n**Position:**\nI'm UTG, the worst position. I have to act first postflop, which makes playing marginal hands even worse.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. A3o is too weak to play from UTG with my stack size. I should preserve my 9.1 BB stack for better spots, preferably when I'm in better position or have a stronger hand. With the short stack at seat 2, I might get an opportunity to call their all-in with a better hand soon.\n\nI don't need to search for more information - this is a straightforward fold decision based on basic poker fundamentals.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** Ks 9c (offsuit, dominated by many hands)\n**Position:** SB (worst position)\n**Stack:** 290 chips (4.5 BB) - extremely short\n**Pot:** 262 chips\n**To call:** 134 chips (about 2.3 BB)\n**Opponent:** GPT-OSS-120B raised to 166 from what looks like button position (seat 5)\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. I'm extremely short stacked - only 4.5 BB\n2. K9o is a weak hand, easily dominated by AK, KQ, KJ, KT, A9, etc.\n3. I'm facing a raise from GPT-OSS-120B who appears to be in late position\n4. Pot odds: 134 to win 262 = ~2:1 odds\n5. My M-ratio is extremely low - I need to make a move soon\n\nFrom the opponent history, I can see GPT-OSS-120B has been active with some raises (hand 99: raise 186, hand 100: some postflop betting). They seem to be playing reasonably aggressively.\n\n**Tournament equity consideration:** With 4.5 BB, I'm in critical territory. K9o is not a great hand, but given my stack size and the pot odds, I need to consider if this is a +EV shove spot.\n\nHowever, K9o is dominated by so many hands in their raising range. Even against a wide button raise range, K9o only has about 45-50% equity at best.\n\n**Decision:** This is a fold. K9o is too weak to commit 46% of my stack with, especially out of position. I should wait for a better spot or a better hand to shove with. Preserving my last 156 chips (2.4 BB) gives me a few more hands to find a better situation.\n\n\nI'll fold and wait for a more favorable opportunity to preserve my dwindling tournament life.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the current situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3d As (Ace-3 offsuit) - decent hand with an Ace but weak kicker\n2. **Position**: BTN (button) - best position\n3. **Stack**: 290 chips (4.5 BB) - very short stacked, in desperate need of chips\n4. **Blinds**: 32/64 - I'm facing a 64 chip call\n5. **Opponents**: Only MiniMax-M2 in BB with 120 chips (1.9 BB) is active\n\nThe pot is 72 chips (8 from SB + 64 from BB). I need to call 64 to win 72, giving me pot odds of about 1.125:1.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's recent history:\n- Hand 93: Folded BB with TT\n- Hand 94: Folded SB with 77 (but this was facing a raise)\n- Hand 95: Checked through with 7s Kh on BTN\n- Hand 96: Called 16 with 6c As from UTG, then checked down\n- Hand 97: Folded with unknown hand\n- Hand 98: Folded\n- Hand 99: Folded facing a big raise\n- Hand 100: Folded from BB\n- Hand 101: Folded from UTG\n- Hand 102: Folded from SB\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems relatively tight/passive, folding often and not showing much aggression.\n\nGiven my situation:\n- I'm extremely short stacked (4.5 BB)\n- I have Ace-high which is likely ahead of random hands\n- I'm on the button\n- The BB is also short stacked and seems tight\n- I need to accumulate chips desperately\n\nThis is a clear shove spot. With only 290 chips and blinds at 64, I have less than 5 big blinds. Ace-3 offsuit is a strong enough hand to go all-in here, especially against a tight opponent who might fold. \n\nIf I call 64, I'll have 226 left (3.5 BB), which still leaves me in desperation mode. \n\nI'll go all-in to maximize fold equity and potentially win the blinds and antes. The aggressive move puts pressure on my opponent, increasing my chances of winning the pot without a showdown. With my extremely short stack, this represents a critical opportunity to rebuild my chip count and stay competitive in the tournament.",

The blinds are 32/64.\n\nLet me analyze my situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A\u26663\u2666 is a weak ace with a suited kicker. From UTG, this is a very marginal hand, especially with a short stack.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. I have to act without any information about what other players will do.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 282 chips, which is only 4.4 BB. This is a very short stack in a tournament situation. With a stack this short, I need to be thinking about survival and finding good spots to get my money in.\n\n4. **Opponents**: Looking at the recent actions:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 88 chips and seems to fold frequently\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 198 chips and has shown aggression (raised 166 in hand 102)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has only 16 chips and is very short\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 4.4 BB, I'm in critical territory. I need to preserve my stack and look for better opportunities. A\u26663\u2666 from UTG is not a good hand to risk my tournament life on.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I have to call 64 chips to win 96, which is 1.5:1 pot odds. But this is misleading because:\n   - I'm out of position\n   - A3 suited plays poorly against calling ranges\n   - If I hit an ace, I'm often dominated by better aces\n   - If I hit my flush draw, I may not have enough chips to realize the equity\n\n7. **Action**: Folding is the clear choice here. I should wait for a better spot - either a better hand or a better position. With such a short stack, I want to be the one shoving, not calling off a significant portion of my stack with a marginal hand from early position.\n\nThe only consideration might be that the players behind me have shown some folding tendencies, but GPT-OSS-120B has also shown aggression. Even if they all fold and I steal the blinds, I'm only adding 96 chips to my 282, which doesn't fundamentally change my situation. And if I get called, I'm in bad shape.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

I have less than 5 big blinds.\n\n4. **The situation**: \n   - Blinds are 32/64\n   - Pot is 88 chips (32 from me as SB, 56 from BB)\n   - I have to act first preflop\n   - Amount to call is 0 (I already posted the SB)\n   - Minimum raise is 96 (which is 1.5x the BB)\n\n5. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B with 246 chips (3.8 BB) - Also very short stacked.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data:\n   - Hand 99: Raised to 186 preflop\n   - Hand 100: Checked preflop, then bet 32 on turn\n   - Hand 101: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 102: Raised to 166 preflop\n   - Hand 103: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 104: Checked preflop, bet 198 on flop\n   - Hand 105: Folded preflop\n\n   Pattern: GPT-OSS-120B seems to fold about 50% of hands preflop, but when they do play, they tend to make large raises (166-186) or large postflop bets (198). This suggests they might be playing a \"push/fold\" strategy with their short stack.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With only 4.4 BB, I'm in critical territory. Standard tournament strategy says I should be looking to get all-in preflop with any decent hand. Ace-King is definitely a premium hand worth going all-in with.\n\n8. **Pot odds**: If I shove 282 chips, the pot would be 370 (88 + 282). If opponent folds, I win 88 chips (increase stack by 31%). If they call, I'm risking 282 to win 370.\n\n9. **Decision**: Given my extremely short stack (4.4 BB) and holding Ace-King, this is a clear all-in situation. The opponent also has a short stack (3.8 BB) and has shown willingness to fold preflop about 50% of the time.\n\n\nShoving maximizes fold equity while ensuring I capitalize on my strong hand. The opponent's pattern of folding and making large raises suggests they're likely to fold or potentially call with a wide range, giving me excellent chip-winning opportunities. With such a short stack, this aggressive move represents the most mathematically sound strategy to potentially double up or steal the blinds.",

Not a good starting hand at all.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position, but with such a weak hand it doesn't help much.\n\n3. **My stack**: 258 chips (4.0 BB) - I'm very short-stacked. This is critical tournament situation where I need to find spots to accumulate chips or risk blinding out.\n\n4. **Opponents**:\n   - Seat 4 (SB): MiniMax-M2 with 80 chips (very short)\n   - Seat 5 (BB): GPT-OSS-120B with 182 chips (also short)\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB): Very tight, has folded preflop 6 times in a row, only called once and then folded on flop. Seems very cautious.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (BB): More aggressive, has made some raises and bets. Showed down pocket aces once. Capable of making moves.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Pot is 96, I need to call 64. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, which is not great for a weak hand.\n\n7. **Tournament situation**: With only 4 BB left, I need to make a move soon. However, J6o is one of the worst hands to do it with.\n\n8. **Stack sizes**: If I raise, the minimum is 128 (2x BB). That would leave me with 130 chips. The SB only has 80 chips, so they could potentially call and be pot-committed. The BB has 182 chips.\n\n**Decision**: With J6o, even though I'm extremely short-stacked, this is not a good hand to risk my tournament life on. The SB is very tight and might fold, but the BB has shown aggression. I should preserve my chips for a better spot, preferably when I have a stronger hand or when I'm in a blind vs blind situation. Folding here is the correct play despite being short-stacked.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: SB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: 2s 3c (very weak offsuit, unconnected low cards)\n- Stack: 258 chips (4.0 BB) - short stacked\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check for free)\n- Only opponent active: GPT-OSS-120B in BB (Seat 5) with 278 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 2s 3c is one of the worst starting hands in poker\n- No suited value, no connected value, low cards\n- Extremely unlikely to win even if we see a flop\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Very tight player - folded preflop in hands 103, 105, 106, 108\n- When they do play (hand 104), they made a large bet on the flop (198 chips)\n- In hand 107, they checked through all streets\n- Generally passive, folds a lot preflop\n\n**Tournament Situation:**\n- I'm down to 4 BB, which is critically short\n- Only 1 opponent (BB) with similar stack\n- This is a shove-or-fold situation\n- I could check to see a free flop, but with 2-3 offsuit, I'm unlikely to hit anything playable\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Give up the 32 chip SB, save 32 chips\n2. **Check**: See free flop with trash hand\n3. **Raise/All-in**: Shove 258 chips with 2-3 offsuit\n\n**Decision:**\nWith 2-3 offsuit, this is a clear fold. Even though I'm short-stacked, I have no fold equity with this hand and I'm almost never ahead. Checking is also an option since it's free, but I'd be playing with trash. \n\nHowever, looking more carefully at the blinds - I posted 32 as SB, but the BB is only 48 (not 64). This seems odd. Let me re-read: \"Blinds: 32/64\" but \"Seat 4 post_bb 48\". This is inconsistent. But the \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests I can check for free.\n\nThe best play here is to fold. Even though it's free to check, playing 2-3 offsuit out of position with a short stack is -EV. I should preserve my 32 chips and wait for a better spot, especially heads-up against a tight opponent where I can shove with any decent hand and have fold equity.\n \nI'm confirming the BB's chip count at 278. With 4 BB, I'm critically short-stacked, which means strategic chip preservation is crucial. Checking might seem tempting, but it risks bleeding more chips with a weak hand. \n\nThe optimal move is a strategic fold. By folding now, I save 32 chips and maintain the ability to make a strong shove later. Waiting for a better hand will maximize my fold equity against the tight opponent, giving me a higher chance of survival in this tournament.",

There are two clubs, so a flush draw is possible. I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 6).\n\n5. **Pot**: 112 chips\n   - Pre-flop: I posted SB 32, BB posted 48, I checked, Seat 5 called 32\n   - So the pot is 32 + 48 + 32 = 112\n\n6. **Opponent**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 246 chips and just called pre-flop from what appears to be the button position (since seats 2, 3, and 4 are out). This suggests they might have a moderately strong hand but not necessarily a premium one.\n\n7. **Action**: It's checked to me, and I can check or raise. The amount to call is 0.\n\nLet me think about my options:\n\n**Option 1: Check**\n- Pros: Free card to try to hit my gutshot, preserve my short stack\n- Cons: Give opponent a free card if they have a strong hand, miss opportunity to take down the pot now\n\n**Option 2: Raise**\n- Pros: Could fold out weak hands, represent strength, take down the pot now\n- Cons: Risk chips with a very weak draw, could face a re-raise and be forced to fold\n\nWith a gutshot straight draw, I have 4 outs (the four 6s in the deck). \n\nI calculate my probability of hitting the straight on the turn. With 4 outs from 47 unknown cards, I have roughly an 8.5% chance of improving my hand. This low probability makes checking the most prudent action.

It's not a premium hand.\n\n2. **Position**: BTN (Button) - Good position, but that doesn't help much with such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Stack**: 226 chips (3.5 BB) - I'm very short-stacked. This is critical tournament survival territory.\n\n4. **Blinds**: 32/64 - The blinds are very high relative to my stack. I'm in the small blind.\n\n5. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B in BB with 262 chips (4.1 BB) - Also short-stacked.\n\n6. **Pot**: 96 chips\n\n7. **Action**: I need to call 32 more to see the flop.\n\n8. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data:\n   - Hand 104: Had AA and made a big flop bet\n   - Hand 107: Had pocket 7s and played passively (check-check-check-check)\n   - Hand 109: Had 2h3h (suited connector) and called preflop, then made a big flop bet\n   - Recent pattern: More folding than aggressive play (folded in hands 105, 106, 108)\n\nLet me think about the tournament situation:\n- I'm extremely short-stacked at 3.5 BB\n- The blinds are eating me alive\n- I need to make a move soon or I'll be blinded out\n- However, 6c 8s is one of the worst hands in poker\n\nMy options:\n1. **Fold**: Save my 32 chips, but I'll be down to 194 chips (3 BB) and in even worse shape next hand.\n2. **Call**: Pay 32 to see if I can hit something on the flop. But with 6c 8s, I'm unlikely to hit and will often be dominated even if I do hit.\n3. **Raise**: Minimum raise is 128, which is more than half my stack. This would be an all-in or fold situation.\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm extremely short-stacked\n- I have a terrible hand\n- My opponent has shown some tightness (multiple folds)\n- The pot is already 96 chips\n\nI think the best play is to **fold**. Here's why:\n- 6c 8s offsuit is in the bottom 10% of starting hands\n- Even though I'm short, I should wait for a better spot\n- Calling 32 chips (14% of my stack) with this hand is just burning chips\n- If I raise, I'm committing over half my stack with a very weak hand\n- I should preserve my chips for a better opportunity, perhaps when I'm in better position with a stronger hand or can be the first to act aggressively\n\nThe tournament dynamics suggest I need to be patient for one more orbit and look for a better hand to shove with. 6c 8s is simply too weak to risk my tournament life on.",

KJo has decent equity against a wide range, and with my short stack, I need to take spots to double up. Folding would leave me with <1 BB, making this a clear call.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Now I have a clear picture. Looking at the current hand:\n\n**Situation Analysis:**\n- I'm in BB with K\u2665 J\u2663\n- I have 162 chips (2.5 BB)\n- Blinds are 32/64\n- Seat 5 raised to 326, but they only have 32 chips left\n- The amount to call is 262, which means I need to put in 262 more chips\n- But I only have 162 chips total!\n\nWait, let me recalculate. If Seat 5 raised to 326 but only has 32 chips, they must have gone all-in for 32 chips. But the \"amount to call\" shows 262, which is confusing.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The pot is 390 chips. Blinds are 32/64, so:\n- Small blind (Seat 5): 32 chips\n- Big blind (me): 64 chips\n- Total before action: 96 chips\n\nIf Seat 5 raised to 326, that would be a raise of 294 (326-32). But they only have 32 chips total, so this doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, I think the data might be showing that Seat 5 has 32 chips remaining AFTER posting the small blind. So they started with 64 chips (32+32), posted 32 for SB, leaving 32, then went all-in for 32.\n\nSo the raise to 326 might be a display error, or it means the total pot would be 326 if I call.\n\nIf Seat 5 went all-in for their remaining 32 chips:\n- I need to call 32 (not 262)\n- This would make the pot: 64 (my BB) + 32 (their SB) + 32 (their all-in) = 128 chips\n\nBut the display shows \"amount to call: 262\" which would mean I need to call 262 chips to match their bet, but I only have 162 chips.\n\nLet me assume the \"amount to call: 262\" is correct, meaning I need to put in 262 more chips. \n\nI realize the situation is more complex than it first appears. With only 162 chips remaining, I need to carefully consider my options. An all-in move seems inevitable, but the discrepancy between the displayed bet and my actual chip count creates uncertainty. The key is to understand the exact betting requirements and my potential actions within the constraints of my limited chip stack.\n\nI'm facing a critical decision point where my chip count doesn't align with the stated betting amount. This suggests either a data error or a unique tournament scenario that requires immediate clarification. My primary goal is to make a mathematically sound decision that maximizes my potential for chip preservation or growth.\n\nThe key considerations are my hand strength, stack size, and potential opponent actions. With KJo in the big blind and a short stack of 162 chips, I'm likely forced to commit fully. The hand has decent high-card potential, which makes an all-in move strategically viable given my limited options.\n\nI'll need to carefully evaluate whether calling or going all-in provides the best expected value, considering the pot odds and potential opponent reactions. My short stack essentially limits my strategic flexibility to a binary decision: commit completely or fold.\n\nThe most probable scenario is going all-in, leveraging the hand's reasonable strength and my constrained chip position to maximize potential tournament survival.",

While I could theoretically set mine, the combination of being out of position and having a marginal hand makes this a fold.\n\nIf I were in a later position or if there were limpers, I might consider calling.

It plays well in multiway pots when you can hit a set, but is vulnerable otherwise.\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB with good postflop position against SB and the caller.\n3. **Pot odds**: There's 6 chips in the pot and it costs me 0 to check, so checking is free.\n4. **Opponents**: MiniMax-M2 appears very tight, folding all 3 previous hands preflop. GPT-OSS-120B seems more active. This suggests the field might be relatively weak.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 99 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks, but seeing a free flop with pocket pairs is generally +EV, especially in position.\n\n**Decision**: I should check here. Raising with pocket fours from BB against two callers is not advisable because:\n- If I raise and get called, I'm likely up against stronger hands\n- Pocket fours don't play well when you don't hit a set\n- I can see a free flop and only continue if I hit my set or the board is very favorable\n- The opponents don't seem overly aggressive based on limited history\n\nChecking allows me to see the flop for free and preserves my stack while maintaining good position.",

The dry board limits potential draws, suggesting opponents likely missed. A modest bet around 4-5 chips could effectively pressure opponents with marginal hands. Checking risks giving free cards to potentially stronger holdings, so a carefully sized bet appears most advantageous.",

          "content": "  The user is asking me to make a decision in a poker hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand Situation:**\n- Position: BB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: 4d 4h (pocket 4s)\n- Stack: 193 chips (96.5 BB)\n- Board: 9h 5d 3c 7d\n- Pot: 16 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Action History:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) called 2, GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) called 1 (small blind), I checked\n- Flop: GPT-OSS-120B checked, I bet 5, MiniMax-M2 called, GPT-OSS-120B folded\n- Turn: It's on me to act\n\n**Current Board Analysis:**\nThe board is 9h 5d 3c 7d. This gives me:\n- No made hand - just pocket 4s\n- No flush draw (I don't have diamonds)\n- No straight draw currently (I would need a 6 for a straight)\n\nHowever, looking at the board: 9-5-3-7. If a 6 comes on the river, I would have a straight (3-4-5-6-7). So I have an open-ended straight draw (need a 6).\n\n**Opponent Information:**\nI just called the function to get MiniMax-M2's actions. The result shows:\n- Hand 1: preflop fold\n- Hand 2: preflop fold\n- Hand 3: preflop fold\n\nSo in the first 3 hands, MiniMax-M2 folded preflop every time. This is the first time they've reached the flop/turn.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 16 chips\n- I can check for free\n- If I bet, minimum raise is 5 (this is a bit confusing - usually minimum raise would be 10 if the previous bet was 5, but they're saying minimum raise to 5)\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Very weak currently - just pocket 4s with no pair. But I have an open-ended straight draw (8 outs - four 6s and four 2s? Wait, let me recalculate).\n\nActually, for a straight: 3-4-5-6-7 would be a straight. I have 4-4. So I need a 6. That's 4 outs. I also could hit a 4 for a set (2 outs). So total outs = 6.\n\nWait, let me think again about the straight possibility. The board is 9-5-3-7. For a straight with my 4:\n- 2-3-4-5-6? No, that would be 2-3-4-5-6 but the board has 7 not 6.\n- 3-4-5-6-7? Yes! If a 6 comes, I have 3-4-5-6-7.\n\nI have 4 outs to the straight (four 6s) and 2 outs to a set (two more 4s). Total 6 outs.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position (BB) against MiniMax-M2\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight so far - folded first 3 hands preflop. This is their first time seeing a flop, and they called my flop bet.\n4. **Pot Odds**: If I check, I see a free card. If I bet, I risk more chips.\n5. **Stack**: I have a healthy stack of 193 chips.\n\n**Opponent's Range**:\nSince MiniMax-M2 has been very tight (folding 3 hands preflop) but called preflop this time and called my flop bet, they likely have:\n- A decent hand like top pair (9x, 5x, 3x)\n- A straight draw (they could have 6x for the same straight draw)\n- Two pair or a set\n- Possibly a flush draw if they have diamonds\n\nWhen they called my flop bet on a board of 9-5-3, they could have:\n- Any 9 (top pair)\n- Any 5 or 3 (middle/bottom pair)\n- A straight draw with 6-7 or 6-4 or 6-2\n- Overcards\n- A flush draw with two diamonds\n\n**My Decision**:\nI have a weak hand with some outs (6 outs = ~12% chance to improve on river). I'm out of position. The opponent has shown strength by calling my flop bet. I should check and see a free card. There's no value in betting here because:\n- Better hands will call or raise\n- Worse hands will"

My hand: Pocket 4s are very weak here. The board has 4 cards to a straight and 3 diamonds. Anyone with a 6 has a straight. Anyone with two diamonds has a flush draw. Anyone with a 9, 8, 7, 5, or 3 likely has me beat.\n\n2. The opponent called preflop (could be with connectors, suited cards, broadway, pairs) and called my flop bet. Now they're betting the turn after I showed weakness by checking. This is a strong signal of strength.\n\n3. I'm getting 3:1 pot odds, but I only have 2 outs (the remaining 4s) to improve to a set, which is about 4.5% chance. That's not enough to call.\n\n4. Even if I hit a 6 for a straight, someone could have a higher straight with 8-6 or a flush.\n\n5. My opponent's betting pattern suggests they have something - could be a made straight, two pair, top pair, or a strong draw.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. My pocket 4s are very weak against this board and betting action, and the pot odds don't justify continuing.",

This is the absolute best starting hand in Texas Hold'em.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n- Position: BTN (Button) - excellent position, acting last postflop\n- Hand: AA (Ad Ah) - the nuts preflop\n- Stack: 192 chips (96 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Action: We're facing a 2 chip call (the big blind)\n\nWith pocket aces, I want to:\n1. Build the pot - I have the best hand\n2. Get value from weaker hands\n3. Potentially thin the field (though with only 2 opponents left, that's less critical)\n\nSince I'm on the button with the best hand, I should raise. Let me think about sizing:\n- Minimum raise is to 4 (2 more chips)\n- Standard raise would be 3x BB = 6 chips total\n- With a strong hand like AA, I might want to raise larger to build the pot\n\nGiven:\n- There are only 2 opponents (SB and BB)\n- The BB is 2 chips\n- Standard open raise from BTN might be 2.5x-3x BB = 5-6 chips\n- With AA, I could go 4x BB = 8 chips to build the pot\n\nI should probably raise to 6 or 8 chips. Let me check if there's any opponent information I should consider. With pocket aces, I don't need to check opponent tendencies - I should just raise for value regardless.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips (3x BB) as a standard sizing. This builds the pot while still giving opponents room to call with weaker hands.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. With only 2 opponents left and being on the button, maybe I should raise a bit more to really build the pot. Let me raise to 8 chips (4x BB). This is still reasonable and will extract more value.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes, both opponents have ~170-197 chips, so they have plenty to call with. I should make it 6 chips (3x BB) as a standard, solid raise.\n\nNo, wait - let me think about this more carefully. There are only 2 players left to act. With AA, I want to:\n1. Build the pot\n2. Get called by worse hands\n3. Not scare everyone away\n\nA raise to 6 (3x BB) is standard. But I could also go to 8 (4x BB) to build a bigger pot. Given that it's a tournament and I want to accumulate chips, and I have the absolute nuts, I'll go with 8 to maximize value.\n\nActually, let me reconsider again. The pot is currently 3 chips. A raise to 6 means I'm raising by 4 chips. A raise to 8 means I'm raising by 6 chips.\n\nStandard preflop raise sizing is typically 2.5x-3x the big blind. With 2 opponents, I could do:\n- 5 chips (2.5x BB)\n- 6 chips (3x BB)\n- 7-8 chips (3.5-4x BB)\n\nWith AA, I want to be on the higher side to build the pot. I'll go with 7 or 8 chips.\n\nLet me make it 8 chips to really build the pot. This is still a reasonable raise that worse hands can call.\n\nActually, I just realized - the minimum raise is to 4, which means a raise of 2 more chips. So if I raise to 6, that's a raise of 4 chips total. If I raise to 8, that's a raise of 6 chips total.\n\nGiven it's a tournament with 96 BB effective stacks, and I have the absolute nuts, I should raise to 8 chips (4x BB) to start building a big pot.\n\nNo, wait. Let me think about this differently. The standard open from the button is usually 2.5x-3x. So 5-6 chips. With AA, I can go slightly larger, maybe 7 chips.\n\nBut you know what? With pocket aces, I just want to get money in the pot. I'll raise to 8 chips (4x BB). This is a solid size that builds the pot while still being callable by many hands.\n\nHmm, but I should also consider that there are only 2 players left. If I raise too big, I might fold out hands like KQ, AJ, etc. that would call a smaller raise.\n\nLet me compromise and raise to 6 chips (3x BB). This is standard, builds the pot, and should get calls from many worse hands.\n\nActually, I think I'm overthinking this. With AA on the button, I should just raise to a standard size of 6 chips ("

          "reasoning_content": "  We have pocket aces (Ad Ah) on the button! This is the absolute best starting hand in Texas Hold'em.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n- Position: BTN (Button) - excellent position, acting last postflop\n- Hand: AA (Ad Ah) - the nuts preflop\n- Stack: 192 chips (96 BB) - healthy stack\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Action: We're facing a 2 chip call (the big blind)\n\nWith pocket aces, I want to:\n1. Build the pot - I have the best hand\n2. Get value from weaker hands\n3. Potentially thin the field (though with only 2 opponents left, that's less critical)\n\nSince I'm on the button with the best hand, I should raise. Let me think about sizing:\n- Minimum raise is to 4 (2 more chips)\n- Standard raise would be 3x BB = 6 chips total\n- With a strong hand like AA, I might want to raise larger to build the pot\n\nGiven:\n- There are only 2 opponents (SB and BB)\n- The BB is 2 chips\n- Standard open raise from BTN might be 2.5x-3x BB = 5-6 chips\n- With AA, I could go 4x BB = 8 chips to build the pot\n\nI should probably raise to 6 or 8 chips. Let me check if there's any opponent information I should consider. With pocket aces, I don't need to check opponent tendencies - I should just raise for value regardless.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips (3x BB) as a standard sizing. This builds the pot while still giving opponents room to call with weaker hands.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. With only 2 opponents left and being on the button, maybe I should raise a bit more to really build the pot. Let me raise to 8 chips (4x BB). This is still reasonable and will extract more value.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes, both opponents have ~170-197 chips, so they have plenty to call with. I should make it 6 chips (3x BB) as a standard, solid raise.\n\nNo, wait - let me think about this more carefully. There are only 2 players left to act. With AA, I want to:\n1. Build the pot\n2. Get called by worse hands\n3. Not scare everyone away\n\nA raise to 6 (3x BB) is standard. But I could also go to 8 (4x BB) to build a bigger pot. Given that it's a tournament and I want to accumulate chips, and I have the absolute nuts, I'll go with 8 to maximize value.\n\nActually, let me reconsider again. The pot is currently 3 chips. A raise to 6 means I'm raising by 4 chips. A raise to 8 means I'm raising by 6 chips.\n\nStandard preflop raise sizing is typically 2.5x-3x the big blind. With 2 opponents, I could do:\n- 5 chips (2.5x BB)\n- 6 chips (3x BB)\n- 7-8 chips (3.5-4x BB)\n\nWith AA, I want to be on the higher side to build the pot. I'll go with 7 or 8 chips.\n\nLet me make it 8 chips to really build the pot. This is still a reasonable raise that worse hands can call.\n\nActually, I just realized - the minimum raise is to 4, which means a raise of 2 more chips. So if I raise to 6, that's a raise of 4 chips total. If I raise to 8, that's a raise of 6 chips total.\n\nGiven it's a tournament with 96 BB effective stacks, and I have the absolute nuts, I should raise to 8 chips (4x BB) to start building a big pot.\n\nNo, wait. Let me think about this differently. The standard open from the button is usually 2.5x-3x. So 5-6 chips. With AA, I can go slightly larger, maybe 7 chips.\n\nBut you know what? With pocket aces, I just want to get money in the pot. I'll raise to 8 chips (4x BB). This is a solid size that builds the pot while still being callable by many hands.\n\nHmm, but I should also consider that there are only 2 players left. If I raise too big, I might fold out hands like KQ, AJ, etc. that would call a smaller raise.\n\nLet me compromise and raise to 6 chips (3x BB). This is standard, builds the pot, and should get calls from many worse hands.\n\nActually, I think I'm overthinking this. With AA on the button, I should just raise to a standard size of 6 chips (",

It's unconnected, unsuited, and low. This is a clear fold in almost any situation.\n2. **Position**: Being UTG means I'll be first to act on every street, putting me at a significant disadvantage. I need a very strong hand to play from this position.\n3. **Action so far**: Small blind and big blind posted, one player folded. I need to call 2 chips to see the flop.\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 3 chips and I need to call 2 chips, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not relevant since my hand is so weak.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: While I have a healthy stack, there's no need to risk chips with such a weak hand from bad position.\n\n**No need to check opponent history** - this is such a clear fold that opponent tendencies don't matter. 2-7 offsuit UTG is a fold 100% of the time against any opponents.\n\n**Decision**: Fold.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 8d 6h - This is a weak, offsuit, non-connected hand. Very low playability.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. However, we're still preflop.\n\n3. **Stack**: 193 chips (96.5 BB) - Healthy stack, no immediate pressure.\n\n4. **Action so far**: \n   - SB posted 1 chip\n   - I posted BB 2 chips\n   - Everyone else folded\n   - SB (GPT-OSS-120B) called the additional 1 chip\n\n5. **Pot**: 4 chips (2 from me, 1 from SB, 1 from SB's call)\n\n6. **Current situation**: I can check (free flop) or raise. Amount to call is 0.\n\n7. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data on GPT-OSS-120B:\n   - They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 1, 2, 6, 7, 8)\n   - When they do play, they tend to call rather than raise (hands 3, 4, 5)\n   - In hand 3, they called preflop, then bet aggressively postflop (15, 30)\n   - In hand 4, they called preflop, checked flop, then folded\n   - In hand 5, they called preflop, then bet small on flop (2) and turn (8)\n\nThis suggests they're a relatively passive player who calls with marginal hands and sometimes bets postflop, but not always.\n\n**Analysis**:\n- My hand 8d 6h is very weak\n- However, I'm getting a free flop since SB just called\n- Pot is 4 chips, I have 193 chips\n- Position advantage on the Button\n- The opponent seems passive\n\n**Options**:\n1. **Check**: See a free flop with a weak hand. Risk: Could hit something but still be dominated. \n2. **Raise**: Try to take down the 4-chip pot immediately. Risk: Could get called and be out of position postflop with a weak hand.\n\nGiven that:\n- My hand is very weak\n- The pot is small (4 chips)\n- I have position\n- The opponent is passive and might fold to a raise\n\nI think checking is the better option. The hand isn't strong enough to raise for value, and while a bluff raise could work, the pot is so small it's not worth the risk. Checking gives me a free chance to hit a miracle flop (two pair, trips, straight, flush draw) while risking nothing.\n\nIf I hit something strong on the flop, I can extract value from this passive player. If I miss, I can easily fold.\n\nThe only argument for raising would be to try to steal the 4-chip pot, but with such a weak hand and a passive opponent who already called 1 chip, they're likely to call a small raise with any decent hand.\n\n**Decision**: Check",

They checked to me on the flop.\n\n**Position and pot odds:**\n- I'm on the button with position advantage\n- No bet to call (0 to call)\n- Pot is small (4 chips)\n- I have a marginal hand\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Middle pair with weak kicker is not strong\n2. **Board texture**: There's a possible flush draw (two spades), and T-8-4 is somewhat coordinated\n3. **Position**: I have position advantage\n4. **Opponent**: They checked, showing weakness\n5. **Pot size**: Very small, not worth fighting over\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 96.5 BB, I should be selective and not get involved in marginal spots\n\nGiven that I have a marginal hand, the opponent checked (showing weakness), and there's no money to call, I should **check**. A raise would be bluffing with a hand that has some showdown value but is vulnerable. Checking allows me to see a free card and realize my equity if I'm ahead, or fold cheaply if the opponent bets on a later street.\n\nThe only reason to bet would be as a bluff to take down the small pot, but with position and a hand that has some value, checking is the better play.",

I have bottom pair with a weak kicker.\n\n**Board texture:**\n- 4s Td 8s 3s - This is a very coordinated board with 3 spades (flush draw) and possible straight draws.\n- The Td is a high card that could easily connect with opponent's range.\n- There are many possible straight draws (5-7, 5-6, 6-7, 7-9, etc.)\n- The flush draw is very dangerous.\n\n**Opponent information:**\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is the only active opponent\n- They posted SB and called preflop\n- They checked on flop and turn\n- Their stack: 225 chips\n\nPreflop action:\n- Seat 5 posted SB (1 chip)\n- I posted BB (2 chips)\n- Seat 5 called 1 (so they put in 2 total, completing the BB)\n- I checked\n\nThis suggests Seat 5 has a wide range. They could have:\n- Any two cards that want to see a cheap flop\n- Small pairs\n- Suited connectors\n- Weak broadway cards\n- Ace-high hands\n\nThe fact they checked flop and turn suggests:\n- They don't have a strong made hand (like top pair+)\n- They might have a draw\n- They might have complete air\n- They might have a marginal made hand they're afraid of\n\n**My situation:**\n- I have bottom pair with a weak kicker\n- There are many draws on board\n- I'm out of position (relative to the opponent who will act after me on river)\n- The pot is very small (4 chips)\n- I have a deep stack (193 chips)\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- With 96.5 BB, I have a healthy stack\n- No immediate pressure from blinds or ICM considerations mentioned\n- The pot is tiny relative to my stack\n\n**Decision analysis:**\n\nOption 1: Check\n- Pros: No risk, see a free river card, pot control\n- Cons: Give free card to draws, miss value if opponent has weaker hand\n\nOption 2: Bet\n- Pros: Extract value from weaker hands, charge draws, take the pot now\n- Cons: Risk getting raised, building a big pot with marginal hand, difficult to get called by worse\n\nOption 3: Fold\n- Only if I think checking is -EV, but folding when checked to seems too tight\n\n**Key considerations:**\n1. My hand is very vulnerable - many cards on river could be bad (any spade, any card 5-7, any T, J, Q, K, A)\n2. The board is very draw-heavy\n3. I'm out of position for the river\n4.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**My hand**: 8d 6h (8\u2666 6\u2665)\n**Board**: 4s Td 8s 3s Ts (4\u2660 T\u2666 8\u2660 3\u2660 T\u2660)\n\n**Hand strength**: I have a pair of 8s with a 6 kicker. The board shows two tens, and four spades (flush possible).\n\n**The nuts**: Any spade in the hand makes a flush. Also, any ten gives trips. I have neither.\n\n**Opponent behavior**: GPT-OSS-120B has been playing relatively cautiously. Looking at their history:\n- They've folded preflop 6 out of 9 times\n- When they do enter pots, they tend to bet aggressively on later streets (Hand 3: bet 15 on flop, 30 on turn)\n- In hand 5, they bet 2 on flop and 8 on turn\n- In hand 4, they check-folded on flop\n\nCurrent action: They've checked to me on the river. The pot is only 4 chips.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the button, which is good.\n\n**My options**: Check or raise (minimum raise to 2).\n\n**Analysis**: \n- If I check, I go to showdown with my pair of 8s and lose to any spade, any ten, or any higher pair.\n- If I bet, I might get a fold from hands that missed or have weak pairs, but any hand that calls likely beats me.\n- The opponent checked, which could mean weakness or a trap with a strong hand.\n\n**Pot odds**: The pot is tiny (4 chips), so there's not much to win. Betting risks 2 chips to win 4.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: I have 193 chips, so risking 2 chips isn't significant.\n\n**Decision**: With my weak pair and the board texture (flush possible, trips possible), and the opponent showing caution by checking, I should check back. There's a high likelihood I'm beat if I bet and get called, and the pot is too small to justify a bluff. Checking allows me to see a cheap showdown.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The opponent has checked on every street. This could indicate:\n1. They have nothing and are giving up\n2. They have a monster and are trying to induce a bluff\n\nGiven their history shows they like to bet when they have something (hands 3 and 5), the check-check-check line suggests weakness more often than strength.\n\nBut my hand is also very weak - just a pair of 8s. Many hands beat me:\n- Any spade (flush)\n- Any ten (trips)\n- Any pair higher than 8s\n- Any two pair\n\nWith such a weak hand on this board, I should just check and hope to win at showdown against complete air, or fold to any aggression (but there is none). The risk of betting and getting called by a better hand is too high for the small reward.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Board has flush and trips possibilities.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm in SB with Qh4s\n- Stack: 196 chips (98 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 11 chips\n- Facing a raise from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) to 8 chips\n- Amount to call: 7 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- Q4 offsuit is a very weak hand, especially from SB\n- No suitedness, no connectivity\n- Dominated by many hands that would raise\n\n**Opponent analysis (Seat 5):**\n- Recent actions show they fold preflop a lot (hands 6, 7, 8)\n- When they do play, they can be passive (hand 9: checked all streets)\n- Hand 5: They called preflop, then bet flop 2, turn 8 - showing some aggression\n- Overall: Seems to be playing tight, folding often, but can make continuation bets\n\n**Position and pot odds:**\n- In SB, I'll be out of position postflop\n- Pot is 11, need to call 7 to win 11 (about 1.57:1 odds)\n- This is not good enough for Q4o\n- If I call, I'll have invested 8 chips (4 BB) with a very weak hand OOP\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (98 BB)\n- No need to get involved with marginal hands\n- Better spots will come\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. Q4o is just too weak to call a raise from OOP, even if the opponent might be raising light. The hand has poor equity and I'll be out of position.",

There's been a min-raise to 4 chips from Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2), who has been very tight - they've folded 7 out of 10 hands preflop and only played 3 hands total. \n\nThe pot is currently 7 chips (1+2+4), and I need to call 4 chips. This gives me pot odds of 4:7 or about 36%, which is very favorable for pocket 8s.\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have pocket 8s - a strong starting hand\n2. I'm on the button (best position)\n3. The raiser is very tight (folded 70% preflop)\n4. Good pot odds\n5. I have a healthy stack\n\nI should definitely play this hand. I have two options:\n- Call: Keeps the pot smaller, see the flop in position\n- Raise: Could isolate the tight player and take control\n\nSince MiniMax-M2 is tight and raised to 4 (2x BB), they likely have a strong range (AA-QQ, AK, maybe JJ-TT, AQ). With pocket 8s, I have good equity against their range and being on the button gives me position advantage.\n\nI think a raise would be good here to:\n1. Build the pot when I likely have the best hand\n2. Isolate the tight player\n3. Take control of the hand\n\nA standard 3-bet would be around 3x their raise, so 12 chips total.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I have pocket 8s (8h 8c)\n- Board shows As Ac Tc - this is a terrible board for my hand\n- I'm on the Button (good position)\n- My stack: 184 chips (92 BB)\n- Pot: 27 chips\n- Opponent MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) checked to me\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nThe board is As Ac Tc - two aces on board and a possible flush draw. This is a disaster for pocket 8s. My hand is essentially worthless here. The best I can hope for is a full house if another T comes, but that's very unlikely.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They've folded preflop a lot (hands 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)\n- In hand 4, they called preflop, called flop, then bet turn\n- They seem fairly tight/passive overall\n- They raised preflop this hand to 4, then called my 3-bet to 12\n\n**Preflop Action:**\n- MiniMax-M2 raised to 4 (small raise)\n- I 3-bet to 12 on the button with 88\n- They called my 3-bet\n\n**What does their preflop call mean?**\nGiven they're usually tight, a call of my 3-bet suggests they have something decent. Could be:\n- A-x hands (now have trips)\n- Pocket pairs (now beat me unless they have 22-77)\n- T-x hands (now have trips with the T)\n- Suited connectors with clubs (flush draw)\n- Maybe some weird bluff\n\n**Current Action:**\nThey checked to me on the flop. This could mean:\n1. They missed and are giving up\n2. They have a monster and are trying to trap\n3. They have a draw and want to see a free card\n\n**My Decision:**\nWith pocket 8s on an As Ac Tc board, I have:\n- No pair (board has two aces higher than my 8s)\n- No draw to a straight or flush\n- Only 2 outs to a full house (the two remaining 8s, but even that might not be good)\n \nAn aggressive move would be pointless. The board completely destroys my hand, and checking is the only sensible option. I'll minimize my losses and see what develops without risking additional chips.",

Actually, when you have a full house on board, you use the best 5 cards. The board is As Ac Tc Ts. If I have 8h 8c, my hand is:\n- As Ac Tc Ts 8h (or 8c)\n- This is Aces full of Tens\n\nBut actually, anyone with:\n- An Ace would have AAA TT (Aces full of Tens) - same as me\n- A Ten would have TTT AA (Tens full of Aces) - which loses to Aces full of Tens\n- Any pocket pair lower than Tens would have the same full house as me (Aces full of Tens)\n\nSo my eights full of... wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think more clearly.\n\nWith As Ac Tc Ts on board:\n- The board itself is Aces full of Tens (AAA TT)\n- If I have 8h 8c, I still only have Aces full of Tens (using the board cards)\n- Actually, I don't improve the board at all. The board is already a full house.\n\nLet me reconsider: In Texas Hold'em, you use exactly 2 hole cards and 3 board cards, or 1 hole card and 4 board cards, or play the board.\n\nWith As Ac Tc Ts on board and 8h 8c in my hand:\n- I can use As Ac Tc Ts 8h = Aces full of Tens\n- Or I could try to use my 8s, but I need 5 cards total\n- If I use both 8s: 8h 8c As Ac Tc = Aces and eights (two pair)\n- If I use one 8: 8h As Ac Tc Ts = Aces and Tens (two pair)\n- The best hand is playing the board: As Ac Tc Ts + either 8 = Aces full of Tens\n\nActually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what hands beat me:\n\n**Hands that beat me:**\n- Any Ace: AAA TT (same as me, but kicker doesn't matter in full house)\n- Actually wait, if someone has an Ace, they have AAA TT, same as me\n- If someone has a Ten, they have TTT AA (Tens full of Aces), which loses to Aces full of Tens\n- So actually, having an Ace is the same as playing the board\n\nLet me reconsider the board: As Ac Tc Ts\nThis is a paired board (two aces, two tens). \n\nActually, I need to be more careful.

The only exceptions would be:\n- If someone has TT, they have TTTT A = Four of a kind Tens (beats me)\n- If someone has AA, they have AAAAT = Four of a kind Aces (beats me)\n\nBut those are extremely unlikely.\n\nGiven the action:\n- Preflop: Seat 4 raised to 4, I re-raised to 12, Seat 4 called\n- Flop: Seat 4 checked, I checked\n- Turn: Seat 4 checked\n\nThe opponent's check on the turn after checking the flop suggests weakness. They likely don't have a monster hand.\n\nHowever, my hand is also very weak on this board. I essentially have the board, which is Aces full of Tens.

But the board IS a full house.\n\nActually, let me think differently. With the board being As Ac Tc Ts, I have:\n- 8h 8c in my hand\n- The board is two aces, two tens\n- So I have Aces full of Tens\n\nBut wait, that's not right. To make a full house, I need three of one rank and two of another.\n\nIf I use As Ac Tc Ts from the board and 8h from my hand:\n- I have two aces, two tens, and one eight = two pair (Aces and Tens)\n\nOh! I was making a mistake. A full house requires THREE of one rank and TWO of another rank. The board has TWO aces and TWO tens. That's only two of each, not three.\n\nSo with As Ac Tc Ts on board:\n- I have two aces and two tens showing = two pair on board\n- With my 8h 8c, I still only have two pair (Aces and Tens)\n\nSo I have:\n- Two pair: Aces and Tens\n- With an 8 kicker\n\nThis is very different! I don't have a full house. I have two pair.\n\nWhat beats me?\n- Any Ace: AAA TT (Aces full of Tens) - beats me\n- Any Ten: TTT AA (Tens full of Aces) - beats me\n- Any pocket pair 22-QQ: As Ac Tc Ts Xx = Two pair (Aces and Tens) - same as me\n\nSo:\n- Hands with an Ace: beat me\n- Hands with a Ten: beat me\n- Hands with a pocket pair: tie with me (except QQ which has a better kicker)\n\nThis is a terrible board for my pocket 8s. I should be very cautious.\n\nGiven:\n- Preflop: Seat 4 raised to 4, I re-raised to 12, they called\n- Flop: Seat 4 checked, I checked\n- Turn: Seat 4 checked\n\nThe opponent's"

The board is already a full house.\n\nLet me reconsider: In Texas Hold'em, you use exactly 2 hole cards and 3 board cards, or 1 hole card and 4 board cards, or play the board.\n\nWith As Ac Tc Ts on board and 8h 8c in my hand:\n- I can use As Ac Tc Ts 8h = Aces full of Tens\n- Or I could try to use my 8s, but I need 5 cards total\n- If I use both 8s: 8h 8c As Ac Tc = Aces and eights (two pair)\n- If I use one 8: 8h As Ac Tc Ts = Aces and Tens (two pair)\n- The best hand is playing the board: As Ac Tc Ts + either 8 = Aces full of Tens\n\nActually, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what hands beat me:\n\n**Hands that beat me:**\n- Any Ace: AAA TT (same as me, but kicker doesn't matter in full house)\n- Actually wait, if someone has an Ace, they have AAA TT, same as me\n- If someone has a Ten, they have TTT AA (Tens full of Aces), which loses to Aces full of Tens\n- So actually, having an Ace is the same as playing the board\n\nLet me reconsider the board: As Ac Tc Ts\nThis is a paired board (two aces, two tens). \n\nActually, I need to be more careful. The board has:\n- Two aces\n- Two tens\n- One card missing (the river)\n\nSo the board is: As Ac Tc Ts X (where X is unknown river card)\n\nCurrent hand strength:\n- I have 8h 8c\n- Board: As Ac Tc Ts\n- Current best hand: As Ac Tc Ts 8h = Aces full of Tens\n\nWho beats me?\n- Anyone with an Ace: same hand",

The only exceptions would be:\n- If someone has TT, they have TTTT A = Four of a kind Tens (beats me)\n- If someone has AA, they have AAAAT = Four of a kind Aces (beats me)\n\nBut those are extremely unlikely.\n\nGiven the action:\n- Preflop: Seat 4 raised to 4, I re-raised to 12, Seat 4 called\n- Flop: Seat 4 checked, I checked\n- Turn: Seat 4 checked\n\nThe opponent's check on the turn after checking the flop suggests weakness. They likely don't have a monster hand.\n\nHowever, my hand is also very weak on this board. I essentially have the board, which is Aces full of Tens. But many hands chop with me here.\n\nPot is 27 chips. I can check and see a free river, or I could try to bluff. But what would I be bluffing with? If I bet, I'm representing what? A full house? But the board IS a full house.\n\nActually, let me think differently. With the board being As Ac Tc Ts, I have:\n- 8h 8c in my hand\n- The board is two aces, two tens\n- So I have Aces full of Tens\n\nBut wait, that's not right. To make a full house, I need three of one rank and two of another.\n\nIf I use As Ac Tc Ts from the board and 8h from my hand:\n- I have two aces, two tens, and one eight = two pair (Aces and Tens)\n\nOh! I was making a mistake. A full house requires THREE of one rank and TWO of another rank. The board has TWO aces and TWO tens. That's only two of each, not three.\n\nSo with As Ac Tc Ts on board:\n- I have two aces and two tens showing = two pair on board\n- With my 8h 8c, I still only have two pair (Aces and Tens)\n\nSo I have:\n- Two pair: Aces and Tens\n- With an 8 kicker\n\nThis is very different! I don't have a full house. I have two pair.\n\nWhat beats me?\n- Any Ace: AAA TT (Aces full of Tens) - beats me\n- Any Ten: TTT AA (Tens full of Aces) - beats me\n- Any pocket pair 22-QQ: As Ac Tc Ts Xx = Two pair (Aces and Tens) - same as me\n\nSo:\n- Hands with an Ace: beat me\n- Hands with a Ten: beat me\n- Hands with a pocket pair: tie with me (except QQ which has a better kicker)\n\nThis is a terrible board for my pocket 8s. I should be very cautious.\n\nGiven:\n- Preflop: Seat 4 raised to 4, I re-raised to 12, they called\n- Flop: Seat 4 checked, I checked\n- Turn: Seat 4 checked\n\nThe opponent's",

So the board has two aces and two tens. I have pocket eights.\n\nLet me think about my hand strength:\n- The board is double paired (Aces and Tens)\n- I have pocket eights\n- This means I have two pair: Aces and Tens (using the board), with an 8 kicker\n- I do NOT have a full house because a full house requires three of one rank and two of another. I only have two aces and two tens on board.\n\nWhat hands beat me?\n- Any Ace: AAA TT (Aces full of Tens) - beats me\n- Any Ten: TTT AA (Tens full of Aces) - beats me\n- Pocket pairs QQ, JJ: These would give a better full house\n- Actually, wait. Let me reconsider the board.\n\nBoard: As Ac Tc Ts\nThis is two aces and two tens. That's four cards. We need a fifth card (the river).\n\nCurrent hand strength:\n- With 8h 8c, I have two pair: Aces and Tens (As Ac Tc Ts 8h)\n\nWhat beats me on this board?\n- Any Ace: AAA TT (Aces full of Tens) - this would be three aces and two tens\n- Any Ten: TTT AA (Tens full of Aces) - this would be three tens and two aces\n- Pocket pair QQ/JJ: QQ would give QQQ AA or QQQ TT depending on which card pairs\n- Actually, let me think more carefully\n\nIf opponent has:\n- Ax: They have As Ac Tc Ts Ax = Full house, Aces full of Tens - BEATS me\n- Tx: They have As Ac Tc Ts Tx = Full house, Tens full of Aces - BEATS me\n- Pocket pair (QQ-22): They have As Ac Tc Ts Xx = Two pair, Aces and Tens - TIES me (unless QQ gives better kicker)\n\nSo the only hands that tie with me are pocket pairs lower than the board pairs. Hands with an Ace or Ten CRUSH me.\n\nNow looking at the action:\n- Preflop: Seat 4 raised to 4, I re-raised to 12, Seat 4 called\n- Flop: Seat 4 checked, I checked\n- Turn: Seat 4 checked\n\nThe opponent has shown:\n- They raised preflop (could have Ax, Tx, premium pairs)\n- They called my 3-bet (could have Ax, Tx, premium pairs, or speculative hands)\n- They checked flop and turn (showing weakness)\n\nFrom the recall data, MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot preflop (hands 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), but in hand 4 they called preflop, called flop, and bet the turn.\n\nThe board is extremely dangerous for my pocket 8s. Any Ace or Ten beats me, and those are very likely holdings given the preflop action.\n\nHowever, my opponent has checked twice now (flop and turn). This shows significant weakness. They would likely bet their strong hands like Ax or Tx for value and protection.\n\nGiven I can check for free and see the river, I should check. Betting would be a bluff, but what would I be bluffing with? I have a decent hand (two pair) but it's very vulnerable. If I bet and get called, I'm likely beat. If I bet and they fold, they probably had a worse hand anyway.\n\nThe pot is 27 chips. Checking is the prudent play here. I have showdown value with my two pair, but I need to be careful.

They're bluffing with a missed draw\n\nGiven the board texture and the fact they called my 3-bet preflop, they could have:\n- Pocket pairs (JJ, QQ, KK, AA, TT) - all of which beat me except JJ/QQ\n- Ax hands (which now have a full house)\n- Some suited connectors with clubs that made a flush\n- Complete air (bluffing)\n\nGiven my hand is just two pair with a weak kicker on a double-paired, 4-flush board, I'm almost certainly beat by any Ace, any Ten, any club, or any pocket pair. The only hands I beat are pure bluffs.\n\nWith my stack of 184 chips, calling 8 chips won't hurt me much, but it's likely throwing chips away. The opponent's small bet could be a value bet with a strong hand or a blocker bet with a medium hand.\n\nI think the correct play here is to fold. My hand is too weak relative to this board texture, and I'm likely beat by many hands in my opponent's range.",

Let me think about the key factors:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 4c 9h is a terrible hand - offsuit, no straight potential (gap is too large), no flush potential, low cards. This is a clear fold in almost any situation.\n\n2. **Position**: Being UTG means I'm first to act post-flop and have 7 players left to act behind me. This is the worst position to play a marginal hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have a healthy stack at 92 BB, so I don't need to take risks with weak hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Let me check if there's any information about the opponents that might justify playing this hand. Actually, with 4-9 offsuit, there's really no justification regardless of opponent tendencies.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 to win 3, which is 1.5:1. But even with good pot odds, this hand has almost no potential to improve to a strong hand.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: Early in a tournament (or at any stage), playing 4-9 offsuit from UTG is -EV. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nI don't even need to check opponent tendencies here - this is a textbook fold situation. The hand has no redeeming qualities.\n\nLet me make the fold decision.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand carefully.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Position: UTG (worst position)\n- Hand: 5d As (Ace-5 offsuit)\n- Stack: 184 chips (92 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- Amount to call: 2 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- A5o from UTG is a marginal hand at best. It's dominated by many Ax hands.\n- The 5 kicker is very weak.\n- From UTG, we need to play very tight.\n\n**Opponent observations:**\nFrom the search results, I can see that \"Kimi-K2\" (the other me at seat 2) has been playing:\n- Hand 8: Raised with 8s Js from MP\n- Hand 9: Checked down with 8d 6h from BB\n- Hand 10: Folded to a raise with 4s Qh from SB\n- Hand 11: Folded to a river bet with 8h 8c (middle pair)\n- Hand 12: Folded preflop with unknown hand\n\nThe other opponents:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2: Not much data, but seems tight\n- MiniMax-M2: Has shown aggression (raised in hand 11)\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Has shown aggression (raised in hand 10)\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 92 BB\n- No need to take marginal spots from bad position\n- From UTG, I should only play premium hands\n\n**Decision:**\nA5o from UTG is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, position is bad, and there's no reason to get involved with such a marginal holding when I have a comfortable stack. Even if I hit an Ace, I'll often be outkicked. If I hit the 5, I'll have a weak pair with no kicker.\n\nThe only consideration might be that the table seems somewhat passive/tight based on the limited history, but that's not enough to justify playing A5o from UTG.\n\n\nI'll discard this hand without hesitation. The risks far outweigh any potential benefits, especially given my position and stack size. It's a textbook fold situation that protects my chip stack and avoids unnecessary trouble.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 6c Kh (King-high, suited connector but very weak - King with a 6 kicker)\n- Position: SB (worst position post-flop)\n- Stack: 181 chips (90.5 BB)\n- Pot: 9 chips\n- Facing a raise to 6 from GPT-OSS-120B in seat 5 (button/late position)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent preflop actions:\n- Hand 8: fold\n- Hand 9: call 1 (limp)\n- Hand 10: raise 8\n- Hands 11-14: fold, fold, fold, fold\n\nSo they've been relatively tight recently, with only 1 raise in the last 5 hands where they entered. The raise to 6 seems significant.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nK6 offsuit is a very marginal hand. It's dominated by any other King (KA, KQ, KJ, KT, K9, K8, K7). The 6 kicker is terrible. This is generally a fold in most situations.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in the SB, which is the worst position. If I call, I'll be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nI need to call 5 to win 9, so getting less than 2:1. This is not great odds for a marginal hand.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack (90.5 BB), no need to take marginal spots. Better to preserve chips for better opportunities.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. K6 offsuit from SB facing a raise is a standard fold. The opponent's raise suggests strength, and I'd be out of position with a very weak hand that has poor equity against their range.",

Has folded preflop in 8 out of 10 recent hands. Only raised twice (both to 6 chips). Seems passive and tight.\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB): Also very tight! Has folded preflop in 7 out of 10 recent hands. Called once (hand #12) and checked down to showdown with Q3 suited, losing.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 84o is trash. Bottom 15% of hands.\n2. **Position**: Good position (BTN) but hand is too weak.\n3. **Opponents**: Both opponents are extremely tight, folding most hands.\n4. **Pot odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3 (1.5:1). Not good enough for this hand.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. No need to gamble with trash.\n\nWhile I could consider stealing since both opponents are tight, 84o is just too weak. Even if they fold 80% of the time, when they call I'm in terrible shape. The risk/reward isn't worth it.\n\n**Decision**: FOLD. This is a clear fold. Hand is too weak, even against tight opponents. Preserve chips for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket Kings (Kh Kc) in the Cutoff position, which is an extremely strong hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Strength**: Pocket Kings is the second-best starting hand in Hold'em. I should be very aggressive with this hand.\n\n**Position**: I'm in the CO (Cutoff), which is a good position - I'll act after the SB and BB, and I'll have position on the preflop raiser if I call.\n\n**Opponent Info**: GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 raised to 4 (a min-raise). Looking at their history:\n- They've been relatively tight, folding preflop in 4 of the last 6 hands\n- They made a raise in hand 10 (amount 8) and hand 15 (amount 6)\n- They tend to check down when they see flops (hand 9)\n- This suggests they might be raising with a somewhat wide range, but not extremely loose\n\n**Stack Sizes**: \n- I have 181 chips (90.5 BB) - a healthy stack\n- GPT-OSS-120B has 224 chips - also healthy\n- The raise is small relative to stacks (4 chips)\n\n**Pot Odds**: The pot is 7 chips, I need to call 4 chips. That's 7:4 or 1.75:1. With pocket Kings, this is a trivial call.\n\n**Action Decision**: With pocket Kings, I should definitely raise for value. I want to build the pot with my premium hand. A standard 3-bet size would be 3x the original raise, so 12 chips. However, I could also go slightly larger to 14-16 chips to really charge anyone wanting to see a flop.\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have a premium hand (KK)\n2. I'm in good position\n3. The raiser seems to be raising somewhat frequently but not extremely loose\n4. I want to build the pot and get value\n5. I want to potentially isolate against the original raiser\n\nI should make a substantial 3-bet. I'll raise to 14 chips, which is about 3.5x the original raise. This is a good size to get value while still being able to fold if things go terribly wrong postflop (though with KK, I'm rarely folding preflop).",

They raised preflop then checked flop here, which could mean:\n1. They have a marginal hand and are giving up\n2. They're trying to trap with a strong hand\n3. They have air and want to see a free card\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 12 chips\n- It costs me 0 to check\n- If I bet, minimum is 4 chips\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check: Take a free card, see if I hit my overcards\n2. Bet: Try to take down the pot now\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (91 BB)\n- The pot is relatively small (12 chips)\n- I have position advantage\n\n**Decision:**\nWith two overcards on a relatively dry board (only one heart draw), checking seems reasonable. I don't have a strong hand, and I have position. I can see a free card and potentially hit one of my overcards. If I bet and get called, I'm likely behind. \n\nChecking also gives me information - if opponent bets turn, I can reassess. If they check again, I might take a stab at the pot on the turn.\n\nLet me check back.",

Let me think about what this could mean.\n\nPossible opponent holdings:\n1. Weak/medium pair that doesn't want to face a raise\n2. Complete air that gave up on the bluff\n3. Strong hand trying to induce a bet (but less likely given they checked all 3 streets)\n\nThe board: Th 2h 3c 9s Kc\n- Possible straights: QJ makes a straight (Q-J-T-9-8... wait, no. The board has T-9, so QJ would make a straight: J-T-9-8-7? No, the board doesn't have 8 or 7. Let me recount: Th-2h-3c-9s-Kc. There are no connected cards for a straight except maybe QJ would make K-Q-J-T-9 which is a straight! K-Q-J-T-9 is indeed a straight. But I only have Q-J, and the board has K-T-9, so I would need the cards to be K-Q-J-T-9 in order. That would be a straight! Wait, let me verify: K, Q, J, T, 9 in sequence. Yes, that's a straight! King-high straight.\n \nI'm carefully examining the board cards: Ten of hearts, Two of hearts, Three of clubs, Nine of spades, and King of clubs. My hand is Queen of clubs and Jack of diamonds. \n\nI realize I need to be precise about the straight possibility. The sequence K, Q, J, T, 9 would indeed create a King-high straight. However, I only hold Q-J, and the board provides K-T-9. I need all five cards in sequential order to complete the straight.\n\nMy actual hand is Kc Qc Jd Th 9s, which is just a King-high hand without a made straight or other strong combination. The potential straight I initially saw doesn't actually exist with these specific board and hole cards.\n\nThe hand strength is minimal - just King-high with a Queen kicker. Betting here would essentially be a pure bluff, hoping my opponent has an even weaker hand or will fold a marginal holding. The pre-flop raiser's check on the river suggests potential weakness, but without more information on their playing style, a bluff remains risky.\n\nI'll need to carefully consider my opponent's tendencies and the potential for them to call with a range of hands before deciding whether to attempt a bluff. Checking seems like the safest approach given the limited information and weak hand strength.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 3c Ts (3 of clubs, 10 of spades) - This is a very weak hand. It's offsuit, disconnected, and has no real potential.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position at the table, which gives me an advantage post-flop. However, my hand is so weak that position doesn't really help here.\n\n**Stack**: 193 chips (48.2 BB) - I have a healthy stack, no need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Pot**: 6 chips (1.5 BB) - Very small pot.\n\n**Opponents**:\n- SB (Seat 2): Kimi-K2 - Based on the recall, this player has been folding a lot preflop (folded in 8 of the last 10 hands shown). Only raised once in hand #16. This suggests a tight player.\n- BB (Seat 3): DeepSeek-V3.2 - This player has also been folding a lot preflop, only called once in hand #16 and folded in the other 8 hands. Also appears tight.\n\n**To Call**: 4 chips (1 BB)\n**To Raise**: Minimum 8 chips (2 BB)\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand Strength**: 3c Ts is a terrible hand. It's offsuit, has no straight potential (gap is too large), no flush potential, and even if I hit a 3 or a T, I'm likely to be dominated.\n\n2. **Position**: While being on the button is great, it doesn't make up for having such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: Both opponents appear to be tight players who fold frequently preflop. This might suggest I could steal the blinds, but:\n   - I'm on the button, not in late position stealing position (though BTN is good)\n   - The raise would need to be to at least 8 chips (2 BB)\n   - With 48 BB stack, I don't need to take marginal spots\n   \n4. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 6 chips, getting 1.5:1 odds. This would require me to win 40% of the time to break even, which is highly unlikely with 3c Ts against likely better hands.\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: I have a healthy stack of 48 BB. There's no pressure to make moves. Preserving my stack and waiting for better spots is the correct play.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, and I don't need to take unnecessary risks with a healthy stack. Even though the blinds appear tight and might fold to a steal, it's not worth risking 2 BB (8 chips) with such a poor hand. I'll wait for a better spot.",

The minimum raise is to 8 chips.\n\n**Key considerations**:\n- UTG is a difficult position to play speculative hands from\n- Pocket threes have about 12% chance to hit a set on the flop\n- If I hit a set, I can potentially win a big pot (implied odds)\n- However, from UTG, I'm likely to face raises behind me, and if I don't hit the flop, I'll be in a tough spot out of position\n- The table seems somewhat tight, but that doesn't mean much from UTG\n- I have a healthy stack, so I can afford to see flops with speculative hands sometimes\n\n**Tournament considerations**:\n- With 48 BB, I'm not in desperate need to accumulate chips immediately\n- Losing a small pot won't hurt my stack significantly\n- However, playing out of position with a weak hand can lead to difficult decisions\n\n**Decision**: This is a borderline spot. Pocket pairs can be profitable, but from UTG with a small pair, it's generally a fold. The risk of facing a raise behind me and having to fold, or playing postflop out of position without hitting a set, outweighs the potential reward. The 4-chip call represents about 2% of my stack, which isn't huge, but the positional disadvantage is significant.\n\nI'll fold this hand from UTG. It's a standard conservative play that avoids tricky situations out of position with a hand that needs to hit a set to be profitable.",

Tens are connected but offsuit, and the 2 is very low. This is a trash hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG, the worst position at the table. I have to act first on every street, giving me no information about what others will do.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: I should check if I have any information about the opponents. Let me search for observations to see if there's any useful information.\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**: \n   - I have a decent stack of 48.2 BB, which is healthy but not huge\n   - This is a tournament, so I need to be selective with my hands, especially from early position\n   - I shouldn't risk chips with marginal hands from bad position\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: The pot is 6, I need to call 4. That's 4 to win 6, or 1.5:1 odds. But this is irrelevant with such a weak hand.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold this hand. UTG with T2 offsuit is an easy fold in any situation. I don't even need to search for opponent tendencies - this is just too weak to play from early position.\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to play this hand by searching for observations about these opponents, but I suspect this will just confirm the fold.\n\nActually, let me just fold. This is a clear fold situation. T2 offsuit from UTG is one of the worst starting hands in poker. I don't need to waste time checking opponent tendencies for this decision.",

My hand is very weak (T8o) - this is a fold in most situations\n2. I'm facing a 3-bet (re-raise) from GPT-OSS-120B\n3. Kimi-K2's initial raise was already strong given their tight nature\n4. The re-raise makes it even more likely both players have strong hands\n5. I need to call 26 chips which is about 14% of my stack\n6. Pot odds: 46:26 or about 1.77:1, which is not great given my hand strength\n7. Even if I hit something, I'll likely be dominated by better kickers or stronger hands\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. My hand is too weak, I'm facing aggression from two players, and the investment is too large relative to my hand's potential.",

They only played hand 24 where they raised preflop and showed aggression on the flop. This suggests they're playing a tight range.\n\n2. **My Hand**: I have 2h Js (offsuit). This is a very weak hand - Jack with a 2 offsuit. \n\n3. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN) which is the best position postflop. However, this is preflop.\n\n4. **Stack Size**: I have 187 chips (46.8 BB) which is a healthy stack.\n\n5. **Action**: It's folded to me on the Button. I need to call 2 chips to see the flop (pot is 6 chips). \n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (calling 2 to win 6), which is good.\n\nHowever, even with good pot odds, J2o is a terrible hand. Against a tight opponent in the BB who has been folding most hands, I should:\n- Not invest chips with such a weak hand\n- Save my chips for better spots\n- Even though I'm on the Button, this hand has very little playability postflop\n\nThe opponent is tight and will likely fold if I raise, but if they call or re-raise, I'm in bad shape. Raising with J2o is not a good strategy against a tight opponent.\n\nBest play here is to fold and wait for a better hand.",

The blinds are 2/4, so this is a relatively deep stack situation.\n\nFrom the opponent actions I can see:\n- In hand 24, the other Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raised to 12 preflop and then called a 3-bet to 30\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) seems aggressive, making big raises and bets\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) folded preflop in hand 24 after the raise\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) also folded\n\nCurrently in this hand:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted SB of 2\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) posted BB of 4\n- Seats 4 and 5 folded\n\nSo it's on me (button) to act. I need to call 4 to see the flop.\n\nWith pocket sixes on the button, this is a decent hand. I have:\n- Position advantage (acting last post-flop)\n- Pocket pair that can flop a set (about 12% chance)\n- If I don't hit a set, I can often continuation bet and take it down\n- My stack is healthy at 46.8 BB\n\nI should consider raising here. A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 12 chips. This would:\n- Build the pot when I hit a set\n- Give me initiative post-flop\n- Potentially take down the blinds preflop\n- Charge opponents to see the flop\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, I think raising is the best play. I'll raise to 12 (3x BB).\n\nLet me check my stack if I raise to 12: 187 - 12 = 175 chips left, which is still 43.75 BB - very healthy.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise to: 8. So I could raise to 8, 9, 10, etc. \n\nI'm weighing the pros and cons of different raise sizes. A 12-chip raise feels like the sweet spot - substantial enough to show strength and protect my hand, but not so large that it commits too many chips. The 3x BB raise aligns with standard poker strategy, giving me control of the pot while maintaining flexibility. It sends a clear message of strength without overcommitting my stack.\n\nThe button position gives me additional leverage. I can apply pressure, control the pot size, and potentially take down the hand preflop. With a pocket pair, I'm in a strong position to dictate the action and potentially build the pot if I connect with the board.\n\nMy tournament life isn't immediately threatened, so I can make a calculated move that balances aggression with strategic positioning. The raise feels like the most advantageous play in this scenario.",

Folding to a raise.\"\n}\n```",
          "reasoning_content": "  I have a pair of sixes on a flop of 9c 7d 3h. This is a relatively dry board with no flush draw and only a gutshot straight draw possible (8-6 would make a straight). My opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 has checked to me.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have a pocket pair (66). The board is 9-7-3. I'm currently ahead of any hand that doesn't have a 9, 7, 3, or pocket pair higher than 6. However, I'm vulnerable to many overcards.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is the best position. I have the advantage of acting last.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been quite tight:\n   - They fold preflop very often (most hands)\n   - When they do call preflop (hands 12, 16, 22), they tend to bet on the flop\n   - In hand 16, they called preflop and bet 8 on flop\n   - In hand 22, they called preflop and bet 5 on flop\n   - They check-called in hand 12 and checked through\n\n   The fact that they checked here suggests they might have missed the flop or have a marginal hand. Their typical pattern is to bet when they have something.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 26 chips. If I bet, I need to consider what size.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 175 chips (43.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. I can afford to make a play here.\n\nThe board is relatively dry - no flush draws, only a gutshot straight draw (8-6 or 8-5 would make a straight). This is a good board to continuation bet as the preflop aggressor.\n\nI raised preflop to 12 and got called by the BB. Now they've checked to me. Standard play here would be to make a continuation bet to represent having a strong hand and to protect my equity.\n\nWith a dry board like this, a bet of about 50-70% of the pot would be appropriate. The pot is 26, so a bet of around 13-18 chips makes sense.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that my opponent called a preflop raise. What hands would they call with?\n- Pocket pairs (77, 88, 99, TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA)\n- Suited connectors\n- Broadways\n\nIf they have 77, 99, or 33, I'm crushed. If they have 88, TT+, I'm behind. If they have two overcards, I'm ahead.\n\nGiven that they checked, it's less likely they have a strong hand like a set or top pair. They would likely bet those to protect against draws and get value.\n\nI think a continuation bet is appropriate here to:\n1. Get value from worse hands (overcards)\n2. Protect my hand against overcards\n3. Take down the pot when they have nothing\n\nLet me bet around 60% of pot, so about 15-16 chips. The minimum raise is 8, so I need to raise to at least 8 total, but since there's nothing to call, I need to bet. The minimum raise to 8 means I can put in 8 chips as a bet, but that's too small. I should bet more.\n\nWait, let me re-read the legal actions. It says \"Minimum raise to: 8\". Since there's nothing to call (amount to call is 0), and I can raise, this means I can bet. The minimum bet is 8. So I can bet anywhere from 8 up to my stack.\n\nA bet of 16 (roughly 2/3 pot) seems good. This is enough to put pressure on overcards but not too big that I'm committed if I get raised.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking at the opponent's pattern again - they tend to bet on the flop when they have something. The fact that they checked suggests weakness. I could also consider checking behind to pot control and see a free turn card. But with a vulnerable hand like 66, I should probably bet to protect my hand.\n\nI think betting is the right play. Let me go with 16 chips (about 62% of pot).",

This is definitely a folding hand from UTG position.\n\nMy position is UTG (Under the Gun), which is the worst position at the table since I'll act first on every street. This means I need to play very tight from this position.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB): Seems to fold preflop a lot (multiple folds in recent hands). Only called twice in the last 10 actions. When they do call, they seem to play straightforward postflop (bet flop, check-fold).\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB): Also folds quite a bit preflop. When they do play (like hand 23), they seem active postflop with betting and calling.\n\nMy stack: 201 chips (50.2 BB) - This is a healthy stack, no need to take unnecessary risks.\n\nWith 3c 4h from UTG:\n- No pair\n- No suited cards\n- Very low cards with no straight potential (would need 2, 5, 6 to make a straight)\n- Even if I hit a pair, it's a very low pair that will be hard to play\n- I'm out of position against everyone\n\nThis is a clear fold. The only consideration might be if the blinds are very tight and I want to steal, but:\n1. I'm UTG, not in a stealing position\n2. My hand has zero playability if called\n3. I have a healthy stack and don't need to take risks\n4. The opponents don't seem extremely tight to the point where I can profitably steal with any two cards\n\nThe decision is straightforward: FOLD.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: J\u2660 5\u2660 - This is a marginal hand. It's suited but very weak. J5s is not a strong hand, especially from the BB.\n\n**Position**: BB (out of position post-flop)\n\n**Stack**: 197 chips (49.2 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + MiniMax-M2's raise of 12)\n- I need to call 8 chips to see the flop\n- MiniMax-M2 raised to 12 from what appears to be CO position (Seat 4)\n\n**Opponent analysis**: MiniMax-M2 has been relatively active. Looking at their recent actions:\n- They fold a lot preflop (hands 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26)\n- They do call sometimes (hand 23, 28)\n- When they call/bet, they seem to continue aggression on flop (hands 23, 27, 28)\n- In hand 23, they called a turn bet then bet the river\n- In hand 28, they called preflop, bet flop, called a raise, then folded on turn\n\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 is capable of raising with a somewhat wide range, but they don't seem overly aggressive. The raise size of 3x (12 chips) is standard.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 18, giving me 2.25:1 pot odds. This means I need ~31% equity to call profitably.\n\n**Hand equity**: J5s against a typical CO raising range (maybe 15-20% of hands) has roughly 30-35% equity. So it's borderline.\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. I'm out of position, which makes it harder to realize my equity\n2. J5s can flop some decent draws (flush draws, straight draws)\n3. I have a healthy stack, so calling 8 chips won't hurt me much\n4. However, I'm likely dominated by better Jx hands and my kicker is very weak\n5. The opponent seems competent enough to put pressure post-flop\n\n**Tournament perspective**: With 49 BB, I should be somewhat selective. While I have pot odds, being out of position with a weak hand like J5s is not ideal. I could easily lose more chips post-flop when I hit a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a fold. While the pot odds are somewhat attractive, J5s is just too weak to defend from the BB against a raise, especially out of position. The risk of being dominated and losing more chips post-flop outweighs the potential upside. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

However, they gave me an error because I tried to call a tool - they want a JSON response directly.\n\nWait, let me re-read the instructions. The user said \"Invalid response format. Please respond with a JSON object...\" but I was trying to use a tool. Looking at the system prompt again, it says I have access to memory tools to recall information. So I should be able to use them.\n\nBut the user is telling me my response format was invalid. Let me think about this - maybe the flow is that I need to make a decision directly, and the tools are available but I should only use them when necessary? Or perhaps the user interface doesn't actually support calling tools in the middle of a decision?\n\nActually, looking at the conversation again, I tried to call recall_my_hands and the user responded with an error about JSON format. This suggests that maybe I cannot call tools - I need to directly respond with the JSON action.\n\nBut the system prompt clearly says \"You have access to memory tools to recall information about past hands and opponent behavior. Use these tools strategically to inform your decisions.\"\n\nThis is confusing. Let me reconsider. Perhaps the issue is that I need to provide a JSON response with my action, but I can also call tools? That doesn't make sense for a single-turn interaction.\n\nOR - maybe the user message is actually from the system, telling me that my attempt to call a tool was in the wrong format? But I used the correct tool format...\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll make my decision based on the information I have without using tools, since the user is insisting on JSON format. I have Qh Kh on the button, which is a very strong hand. I'm facing a min-raise situation (need to call 2 more chips).\n\nPosition: BTN (best position)\nHand: KQs (suited Broadway) - very strong\nStack: 195 chips (48.8 BB) - healthy stack\nAction: Everyone folded to me, I posted SB (2), BB is 4, I need to call 2 more to see flop\n\nThis is an easy raise for me. I should raise to build the pot with my strong hand and get value. A standard raise would be 3x the big blind, so 12 chips total. But minimum raise is 8.\n\nLet me raise to 12 (which is 3x BB). This is a standard open-raise size.\n\nActually, wait - I posted SB of 2, BB is 4, so the pot is 6. I need to call 2 more to make it 4 total (matching the BB). A raise to 12 would be standard.\n\nBut let me reconsider the tools issue. The system prompt says I have access to tools. The user message says \"Invalid response format\" when I tried to use one. This might be a test to see if I follow instructions. The most recent instruction is from the user telling me to provide JSON. So I should provide JSON.\n\nActually, I think I understand now. The system is set up so that I need to provide a JSON response with my action. The tools are available, but perhaps I need to make my decision in a single response without calling tools, OR the tool calling should be part of my reasoning but not a separate message.\n\nLet me just make the decision: I have KQs on the button. This is a premium hand in position. I should raise for value. I'll raise to 12 chips (3x BB).",

They called my preflop raise of 12, so they have something.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I have top pair, good kicker (K-Q on K-7-6 board)\n- The board has some draws: 6-7-8 could make a straight, and there are clubs for a flush draw\n- I raised preflop and they called\n- Pot is 24, I can check or raise\n- They're the only opponent left\n\nGiven I have top pair with a good kicker and the board is somewhat coordinated (straight and flush draws possible), I should make a continuation bet to:\n1. Get value from worse hands (K-J, K-10, A-7, etc.)\n2. Charge draws to continue\n3. Build the pot with my strong hand\n\nA bet of about 2/3 pot (16 chips) seems appropriate.

The flush draw is still possible.\n\nI should consider:\n1. **Value betting**: I likely have the best hand but need to protect against draws\n2. **Pot control**: Check to avoid building a big pot with a vulnerable hand\n3. **Opponent's range**: They called preflop and flop - could have Kx, clubs, straight draws, or middle pairs\n\nGiven the coordinated board and potential draws, I think a value bet is appropriate to charge draws and get value from worse hands. I need to size it appropriately.\n\nA bet of around 1/2 to 2/3 pot (28-37 chips) would be good for value and protection. The minimum raise is 16, but that's too small - it gives draws good odds.\n\nLet me bet 32 chips (about 57% of pot) to charge draws while still getting called by worse hands.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Hand:** Jc 7d - This is a weak offsuit hand with no suitedness and marginal connectivity. Jack-high with a 7 kicker is not a strong hand.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. This gives me some advantage.\n\n**Stack:** 137 chips (34.2 BB) - I'm in decent shape, not short-stacked.\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - Has been fairly active with a mix of folds, raises, and calls. From the data, they raised in hands 24 and 28, called in hands 24 and 30, and folded often. They showed down K9o in hand 30. They seem to be playing a reasonable range.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - Has been quite passive, folding most hands. They called small bets in hands 22, 26, and 27, but folded to most aggression. They seem tight.\n\n**Pot:** 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n\n**Action:** I need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** J7o is a weak hand that should be folded in most situations. The only redeeming factor is my position on the button.\n2. **Opponent Tendencies:** \n   - SB (Kimi-K2) seems moderately aggressive, capable of raising with decent hands\n   - BB (DeepSeek-V3.2) is tight and folds to aggression often\n3. **Pot Odds:** I need to call 4 to win 6, so 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not enough to justify playing a weak hand.\n4. **Implied Odds:** With J7o, I don't have good implied odds. If I hit a Jack, I could be dominated by better Jacks. If I hit two pair, it's vulnerable. The only really strong hand I can make is a straight (which is unlikely).\n5. **Tournament Considerations:** I have a decent stack and there's no need to gamble with a weak hand. Better opportunities will come.\n\n\nI'll cut my losses and wait for a stronger hand. Folding is the most prudent move here, preserving my chips for a better opportunity. The weak hand combined with unfavorable pot odds makes this an easy decision.",

The suitedness gives some potential, but it's easily dominated by better Kings and the 5 kicker is very weak.\n2. **Position**: Being UTG is terrible for playing marginal hands. I'll have multiple players acting after me.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) seems to be an active player who calls and raises. This makes playing a marginal hand from UTG even more dangerous.\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 34.2 BB, I have a playable stack. I shouldn't be risking chips with marginal hands from bad position.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. K5s is not strong enough to open from UTG position, especially against opponents who have shown activity.

          "reasoning_content": "  I'm in the BB with 3d 7h, which is a very weak hand (27 offsuit). The action has come to me with just MiniMax-M2 calling from what appears to be middle position (Seat 4). \n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n1. **Hand strength**: 3d 7h is trash. Not connected, not suited, low cards. This is a fold in almost any situation.\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB, so I'll be out of position postflop.\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 called from middle position. Looking at their recent history, they've been fairly passive - they folded preflop in hands 30, 31, and 33, raised once in hand 29, and played a very passive hand 32 (checking all streets then folding river). This suggests they're not super aggressive.\n4. **Pot odds**: There's 10 chips in the pot and I can check to see a free flop. So pot odds are infinite (free look).\n5. **Stack size**: I have 133 chips (33.2 BB), which is a decent stack but not deep enough to mess around with trash hands.\n\nEven though I can check for free, playing 37o out of position is a recipe for losing chips. The hand has almost no potential - it would need to hit two pair or better to likely be good, which is very unlikely (roughly 2% chance). Even if I hit one pair, it will often be dominated.\n\nThe only argument for checking is that it's free and I have a decent stack. But tournament poker is about preserving chips and not bleeding them away with marginal spots. This is a clear fold situation.\n\nWait, I need to reconsider. The amount to call is 0, which means I can check. In poker, when you're in the BB and everyone just calls, you have the option to check and see a free flop. Since there's no bet to call, \"fold\" would mean giving up my BB investment completely without seeing a flop.\n\nHowever, with 37o, even a free flop is often not worth it because:\n1. I'll be out of position\n2. The hand has extremely poor equity\n3. I could get trapped with a weak hand\n4. It can lead to difficult decisions postflop\n\nBut technically, since it's free, some players might argue to take the flop. I think this is still a fold because the long-term EV of checking with 37o is negative due to the reverse implied odds and positional disadvantage.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. In tournament poker with 33 BB, I should be more selective. The EV of checking 37o is almost certainly negative. I should fold and save my chips for better spots.",

It's not suited, not connected well (gap), and low cards. This is a fold in most situations.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the button which is great position, but that doesn't make up for such a weak hand.\n\n**Stack Size**: I have 141 chips (35.2 BB) which is a decent stack but not deep enough to play speculative hands like this profitably.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**: Looking at the opponent in seat 2 (Kimi-K2), I can see they've been fairly active:\n- They fold preflop often (hands 26, 27, 29, 33, 34)\n- But they also raise sometimes (hand 28, 31)\n- In hand 30, they called preflop and went all the way to showdown with Kd 9h\n\nThe opponent seems to be playing a somewhat straightforward game - folding weak hands, playing decent ones. They're not overly aggressive.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 2 to win a pot of 6, so 3:1 odds. But with 86o, even these odds aren't good enough.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: While I'm not super short stacked, I shouldn't be bleeding chips with garbage hands. The button gives me steal opportunities, but 86o is too weak even for a steal attempt. If I raise and get called, I'll be out of position postflop with a weak hand.\n\nThe only argument for playing this hand is the good position and the fact that everyone else has folded, so it's just me vs the BB. But 86o is just too weak. Even if the BB folds 50% of the time to a steal, it's not profitable with this hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

However, the hand is just too weak to play.\n\n**Stack**: 141 chips (35.2 BB) - This is a healthy stack size, not desperate.\n\n**Pot**: 6 chips (blinds)\n\n**Players left to act**: Only the blinds after me (Seat 2 and Seat 3)\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from the data:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 in SB): Folded preflop in hand 34\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB): Folded preflop in hand 34 and hand 35, bet on turn in hand 33\n- Generally, opponents seem to be playing somewhat tight\n\n**Hand History Analysis**:\n- I've been folding a lot (28 folds out of 35 hands) - about 80% fold rate\n- I've only won 6 out of 35 hands\n- My recent hands were mostly folds with weak holdings\n\n**Decision**: With 9-3 offsuit, even on the button, this is a clear fold. The hand has:\n- No high card value\n- No suitedness\n- No connectivity (gap of 5 ranks)\n- Very low chance of making a strong hand postflop\n\nWhile I could theoretically try to steal the blinds with a raise, this is not a good spot:\n1. My hand is too weak to play postflop if called\n2. I don't have enough information that the blinds are extremely tight\n3. The risk/reward isn't worth it with this hand strength\n4. I should preserve my chips for better spots\n\nThe correct play is to fold.",

It has very little potential to make strong hands.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position. I'll be acting first on every street, giving me a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recalled actions, I can see that players are folding frequently preflop (Seat 4 folded multiple times, Seat 5 folded multiple times), but there was one raise from Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) in hand #36. This suggests players are relatively tight.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 35 BB, I have a workable stack. I should preserve chips and wait for better spots rather than playing garbage hands from early position.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is 6 chips and I need to call 4 chips, giving me 1.5:1 pot odds. Even with these odds, 63o is just too weak to play from UTG.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. Playing 63o from UTG would be a significant mistake.

It's not a standard opening hand from early position because:\n1. It's easily dominated by better Kings (AK, KQ, KJ, KT)\n2. The 7 kicker is very weak\n3. Off-suit reduces flush potential\n4. From UTG, we're facing 4 opponents behind us\n\n**Position:**\nBeing UTG is the worst position - we have to act first preflop and will be out of position postflop against anyone who calls. This means we need a much stronger range from this position.\n\n**Stack Size:**\nWith 35.2 BB, we're in a medium stack situation. We should be careful about committing chips with marginal hands.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nWe need to call 4 to win 6, which is 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not relevant here since our hand is too weak to call.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- We have a decent stack (35 BB)\n- No need to take risks with marginal hands\n- Better spots will come\n\n**Conclusion:**\nK7o is a clear fold from UTG. It's not in any standard opening range from early position. We should wait for better hands or better positions.\n\nI should fold this hand.",

This gives me a significant advantage.\n\n3. **Stack**: 137 chips (34.2 BB) - This is a healthy stack, not too short.\n\n4. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B in SB position. Looking at their history:\n   - They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 25-32, 34-37)\n   - They called in hand 33 (check-called on flop then folded turn)\n   - They showed aggression in hand 24 with a raise on flop and bet on turn\n   - Overall, they seem tight but capable of aggression when they play\n\n5. **Action**: SB posted 2, I posted BB 4, and SB just called the additional 2 (not raised). This suggests they don't have a premium hand.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: There's 8 in the pot, and it costs me 0 to check. I have a free look at the flop.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack and can afford to see flops with speculative hands in position.\n\nGiven that I have a strong suited hand in position, facing a limp from SB, I should raise. Raising achieves several things:\n- Builds the pot when I likely have the best hand\n- Gives me initiative post-flop\n- Can win the pot immediately\n- Puts pressure on the opponent\n\nSince the minimum raise is 8 (2x the BB), and I have a healthy stack, I should raise to something like 12-16 (3-4x BB). This is a standard raise size.\n\nLet me check if there are any relevant observations about this specific situation.",

They made a large raise (30) in hand 24, then another raise on the flop (60). They've also folded many times recently (hands 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37). In hand 39, they called then folded.\n\nThe pattern suggests they raise with a wide range but also fold frequently. The current raise to 12 seems standard.\n\n**Hand Strength**:\n- KTo is a marginal hand, especially from SB\n- Dominated by KJ, KQ, AK\n- Decent against weaker hands but vulnerable\n- In SB, I'm out of position for the entire hand\n\n**Pot odds**: Need to call 10 chips to win 18 (already 2+4+12). That's 10/28 = 35.7% equity needed.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have 35.8 BB, a healthy stack\n- Don't want to play big pots out of position with marginal hands\n- Could 3-bet as a squeeze play since it's just me and BB left\n\n**Decision**: \nFrom SB, KTo is a fold against a standard raise. It's too weak to call out of position, and 3-betting would be a bluff that risks too many chips. The opponent's raise size is standard, and while they fold sometimes, they're not super tight. \n\nI should fold and preserve my chips for better spots.",

I should preserve my chips.\n\n**Opponent tendencies**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 33, 34, 38, 39, 40). They did raise to 12 in hands 36 and 37. They called down in hand 37 but folded on river, showing they can be sticky but eventually fold.\n- Seat 3 (BB): Has been very tight, folding in 7 out of 10 recent hands (hands 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40). They called once (hand 33) and folded preflop in hand 34. When they did play hand 33, they bet on flop and turn, suggesting they play straightforwardly when they have a hand.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to win 12, getting 1.5:1 odds. But with 35o, even these odds aren't good enough.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 17.9 BB, I have a workable stack. I shouldn't waste 8 chips (1 BB) on a hand this weak. I should wait for better spots.\n\nThis is a clear fold. 35o is in the bottom 10% of hands and should almost always be folded preflop, especially when facing a standard raise.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The hand is preflop with me in UTG position. I have K\u2663 J\u2665. My stack is 143 chips (17.9 BB). Blinds are 4/8, so it's 8 to call.\n\nLet me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: K\u2663 J\u2665 is a decent hand but not premium. It's offsuit and from UTG, this is typically a fold in most situations, especially with deeper stacks. With 17.9 BB, I'm in the \"short stack\" territory but not desperate yet.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act postflop. This is a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, I see:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has been folding a lot preflop\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has been somewhat active, making a raise in hand 40\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) and the other Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) have mixed actions\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I'm at 17.9 BB. This is a critical stack size - I'm not in push/fold territory yet (usually <10-12 BB), but I need to be careful. I don't want to bleed chips.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 17.9 BB, I should be relatively tight from early position. I need to preserve my stack for better spots, preferably in later position or with stronger hands.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: 8 chips to call into a pot of 12, so 1.5:1 odds. This isn't really relevant since I'm deciding whether to play the hand at all, not whether to call a raise.\n\nStandard poker strategy says KJo from UTG is a fold, especially with a sub-20 BB stack. The hand is too easily dominated by better kings (AK, KQ) and better jacks (AJ, KJ). The offsuit nature reduces its playability, and being out of position makes it even worse.\n\nI should fold this hand and wait for a better spot, preferably in later position or with a stronger hand.",

The hand is too weak, I'm out of position, the opponent appears to be tight (making their raise more meaningful), and calling would cost me too much of my stack relative to my chances of winning.\n\nI could consider a re-raise as a bluff since the opponent seems tight, but with 2c 4s this is too risky. If they call, I'm in terrible shape post-flop with no equity. And if they shove, I have to fold. It's better to preserve my chips for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** Ts 3h (Ten of spades, Three of hearts) - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and with a large gap.\n\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - This is the best position at the table, but...\n\n**Stack:** 131 chips (16.4 BB) - This is a short stack situation. I'm in \"push/fold\" territory, especially with a weak hand.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 28 chips\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 16\n- Seat 5 folded\n- I need to call 16 to see the flop\n\n**Key considerations:**\n\n1. **Hand strength:** Ts 3h is trash. It's not connected, not suited, low kicker. This hand has very little equity even against random hands.\n\n2. **Position:** While BTN is good, it doesn't make up for having a terrible hand.\n\n3. **Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 raised from MP (middle position) to 2x the BB (16 chips). This is a min-raise. I don't have history on this opponent from the search, but they're in middle position with a healthy stack (255 chips = ~32 BB).\n\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 16 to win a pot of 28. That's 16/(28+16) = 16/44 = ~36% pot odds. My hand likely has much less equity than that.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With 16.4 BB, I need to be very selective. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not calling raises with marginal hands. Calling 16 chips would cost me 12% of my stack with a hand that will rarely hit and will be difficult to play post-flop.\n\n6. **Stack preservation:** Calling here would leave me with 115 chips. If I miss the flop (which I will most of the time), I'll have invested 16 chips for nothing. This is a leak that will bleed my stack.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, the stack size is too short to play speculative hands, and calling would commit too much of my stack with poor odds.",

It's offsuit, not connected, and the queen is dominated by many hands.

With my tight playing history and short stack, I should wait for a better spot to accumulate chips, preferably from late position or with a stronger hand.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3d Kd (King-3 offsuit, but suited)\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun - first to act)\n3. **Stack**: 131 chips (16.4 BB)\n4. **Blinds**: 4/8, so it's 8 to call\n\nLet me analyze:\n\n**Hand Strength**: K3s is a marginal hand. The suited King has some potential, but the kicker is very weak. This is generally not a good hand to play from early position.\n\n**Position**: UTG is the worst position. I have 4 players behind me who could have much better hands. From UTG, I should be playing a very tight range.\n\n**Stack Size**: 16.4 BB is getting short. In tournament poker with a short stack, I need to be selective but also look for spots to accumulate chips. However, with a marginal hand from worst position, this isn't the right spot.\n\n**My History**: Looking at my hand history, I've been very tight - 39 folds out of 47 hands (83% fold rate). I've only won 7 hands. This suggests I've been playing very conservatively, which is appropriate given my short stack.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**: From the preflop actions I can see:\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has both folded and raised\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has raised and folded\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been folding a lot\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 has been folding\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: With 16.4 BB, I'm in the \"push/fold\" territory. I should be looking for spots to either shove all-in or fold. Playing marginal hands for a standard raise from early position is not optimal.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. K3s from UTG with a short stack is not a profitable play. I should wait for a better spot, preferably from late position or with a stronger hand. The risk of running into a better King or any premium hand from one of the 4 players behind is too high.\n\nThe pot odds are 8 to win 12 (1.5:1), which might seem okay, but the implied odds are poor with a weak kicker, and the reverse implied odds (losing a big pot when dominated) are significant.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 8s 4d - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. It's in the bottom 20% of starting hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position, but my hand is just too weak.\n\n3. **Action**: DeepSeek-V3.2 in Seat 3 raised to 24 chips (3x the big blind). This is a significant raise. Let me check their history:\n   - From the recall, I can see DeepSeek-V3.2 has been very tight, folding most hands\n   - They only raised preflop once before (hand #44) for 24 chips\n   - In hand #33, they showed aggression with bets on flop and turn\n   - Overall, they seem to be a tight-aggressive player who doesn't raise often\n\n4. **Stack sizes**:\n   - My stack: 123 chips (15.4 BB)\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2: 115 chips\n   - I have a medium-short stack in tournament context\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 chips to win 36 chips = 2.25:1 pot odds. This is not enough for a hand this weak.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 15.4 BB, I need to be selective. This is not a good spot to defend with such a weak hand against a tight player's raise.\n\n7. **Implied odds**: Even if I hit something, my hand is easily dominated. If I hit an 8, I could be against a bigger 8. If I hit a 4, it's almost never good.\n\nThe opponent's tight raising range means they're likely holding strong hands (pairs, high cards, strong suited connectors). My 84o has very little equity against that range.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is an easy fold with a trash hand against a tight player's raise. \n\nI'll conserve my tournament chips for a better opportunity. The risk-reward ratio simply doesn't justify calling with such a weak hand against a tight opponent's raise.",

With 14.9 BB, I need to accumulate chips. A min-raise to 16 is a good steal attempt that risks minimal chips while leveraging my position and opponent's tightness. Even if called, I have some playability post-flop in position.\"\n}\n```",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: Q9 offsuit - This is a marginal hand. Q9o is not a premium hand but has some potential, especially in position.\n\n**My position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position post-flop. I get to act last on every street.\n\n**My stack**: 119 chips (14.9 BB) - I'm short-stacked. With less than 15 big blinds, I need to be looking for spots to either shove or fold. I don't have room to play speculative hands.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Everyone folded to me on the button\n- I need to call 4 chips to see the flop (pot is 12, I posted 4 as SB)\n- The BB (Kimi-K2) is the only player left\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Looking at Kimi-K2's recent actions:\n- They folded preflop in hands 38-40, 42-49 (very tight)\n- In hand 36-37 they were raising preflop (older hands)\n- In hand 41 they called preflop, then bet on turn and river\n\nThis suggests Kimi-K2 has been playing very tight recently, folding 9 out of the last 10 hands preflop.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 14.9 BB, I should generally be playing a push/fold strategy. Q9o is a borderline hand for a button shove with this stack size. Against a tight BB who folds a lot, I could consider stealing.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 4 to win 12 (3:1 odds). If I raise, minimum is 16 (which is a significant portion of my stack).\n\n**Decision**: \n- Folding is safe but maybe too tight given my position and opponent's tightness\n- Calling is not ideal with a short stack and marginal hand - I'd be playing post-flop out of position with a weak hand\n- Raising to 16 (minimum) commits about 13% of my stack. Given that the BB has been folding 90% of the time, a steal attempt could be profitable\n\nGiven that Kimi-K2 has folded 9/10 recent hands preflop, and I'm on the button with a short stack where I need to accumulate chips, I think a raise (steal attempt) is the best play. The minimum raise to 16 seems appropriate - it's enough to put pressure without risking my whole stack.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 14.9 BB, a min-raise to 16 leaves me with 103 behind. If I get called or raised, I'm in a tough spot with Q9o. \n\nThe more standard play with this stack size would be either:\n1. Fold - preserve my stack for a better spot\n2. Shove all-in - maximize fold equity\n\nGiven the opponent's extreme tightness (folding 90% of hands), a shove might actually get through often enough to be profitable. Q9o is a decent hand for a button shove against a tight player.\n\nLet me think about the math: If they fold 90% of the time, I win 12 chips. 10% of the time they call (likely with a strong range), and I'll have about 30-40% equity. The EV might be positive.\n\nBut actually, looking at standard push/fold charts, Q9o from the button at 15 BB is typically a fold against a standard opponent. However, against someone folding 90% of hands, it becomes a clear shove.\n\nI'll go with a raise (steal attempt) rather than an all-in shove. The minimum raise to 16 risks fewer chips and should still accomplish the goal of stealing the blinds given how tight the BB has been playing.",

However, in hand #37, they called flop and turn bets before folding on the river, showing they can go to showdown with marginal hands. They also made bets on turn and river in hand #41.\n\nThe fact that they called my preflop raise from the BB suggests they have something - could be a pocket pair, a Qx hand, or maybe a suited connector/hearts.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** I have top pair with a decent kicker. The board is relatively dry except for the two hearts. I should be ahead of most of their range here.\n2. **Position:** I'm in position (BTN) which is good.\n3. **Stack size:** I have 13.4 BB, which is short but not desperate yet.\n4. **Pot size:** Pot is 32, which is about 30% of my stack.\n5. **Opponent:** They called preflop from BB, could have a wide range but likely has some equity.\n\n**Decision:** This is a good spot to bet for value and protection. I want to:\n- Get value from weaker hands (like 5x, 33, small pairs, flush draws)\n- Protect against flush draws\n- Build the pot since I likely have the best hand\n\nI should make a solid value bet. The pot is 32, so a bet of around 16-24 chips (50-75% pot) seems appropriate. This will charge flush draws and get value from weaker pairs.\n\nLet me make it 24 chips (75% pot) to charge draws and get value.",

This is a marginal hand in early position. Let me think about the factors:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Q5s is not a strong starting hand. It's suited, which gives some flush potential, but the kicker (5) is very weak. In UTG, this is a clear fold.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position (first to act). I need a much stronger hand range from this position.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 139 chips (17.4 BB), which is getting short. I need to be selective with my spots and preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n4. **Recent play**: I've been very tight, which is good. My opponents likely see me as a tight player. I should maintain this image and only play strong hands.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 17.4 BB, I'm not desperate yet, but I can't afford to bleed chips on marginal hands. I should wait for a better spot, preferably in late position or with a stronger hand.\n\n6. **Opponents**: Looking at the table, DeepSeek-V3.2 (SB) and MiniMax-M2 (BB) are the only players left to act. MiniMax-M2 has a big stack (287 chips), so they could defend their BB aggressively.\n\nQ5s from UTG is a clear fold. I should preserve my chips for a better opportunity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with Ad Kd (Ace-King suited diamonds)\n- My stack: 131 chips (16.4 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 16 chips\n- Only opponent: GPT-OSS-120B in SB who called 4 (so they posted small blind and called the additional 4 to make it 8 total)\n- I have the option to check or raise (no one has raised yet)\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- Ad Kd is a premium hand, especially on the button\n- This is one of the best starting hands in poker\n- I have position on my opponent\n\n**Opponent analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the search results, I can see that GPT-OSS-120B has been quite tight:\n- Hand 43: Checked as SB, then folded to a flop bet\n- Hand 44: Folded to a raise\n- Hand 45: Raised from SB and took it down preflop\n- Hand 46: Folded to a raise\n- Hand 47: Folded as UTG\n- Hand 48: Folded to a raise\n- Hand 49: Folded to a raise\n- Hand 50: Folded from SB\n- Hand 51: Folded as UTG\n- Hand 52: Folded as UTG\n\nPattern: GPT-OSS-120B folds frequently to raises, especially when facing aggression. They seem to play relatively tight and straightforward. In hand 45, they raised from SB and won preflop, suggesting they defend their blind sometimes but generally play tight.\n\n**Position and stack considerations:**\n- I'm on the button (best position)\n- My stack is 16.4 BB, which is getting short\n- With AKs, I want to build the pot and potentially get all-in\n- The pot is currently 16 chips (2 BB)\n\n\n- I need to extract maximum value from this premium hand\n\nI'll focus on a strategic raise that builds pot pressure. With my tight table image, a significant raise should signal strength. I'll target a 3-4x big blind raise to extract value and potentially force a fold from my cautious opponent. This approach maximizes my chances of either winning the pot immediately or setting up a favorable all-in scenario.",

It's unsuited, not connected, and has low cards.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position. However, with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n**Stack Size:** I have 143 chips (17.9 BB), which is a decent stack but not huge. I should be selective with my calls.\n\n**Pot Size:** 12 chips (SB+BB)\n**Amount to call:** 8 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 has been quite tight lately, mostly folding preflop. They did raise in hands 51 (16) and 52 (24), but otherwise mostly folds.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 has been extremely tight, folding almost every hand. They only raised once (hand 49) and otherwise folded every other hand.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I'm getting 12:8 or 1.5:1 odds. This means I need 40% equity to break even on a call. With 7-3 offsuit, I have terrible equity against any reasonable range.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** With 17.9 BB, I have a workable stack. I shouldn't be throwing away 8 chips (1 BB) on a garbage hand like this. I need to preserve my stack for better spots.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. My hand is terrible, I'm not getting good enough pot odds, and both opponents appear to be playing relatively tight. Even though I'm on the button, 7-3 offsuit is simply not a playable hand in this situation.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

It has very little potential - no straight possibilities (except a gutshot to 3-4-6-7), no flush possibility, and even if you hit a pair, it's a very weak pair.\n\n2. **Position:** UTG is the worst position to play a weak hand from. I'll have to act first on every street, giving all opponents the advantage of seeing my actions before they act.\n\n3. **Stack Size:** With 17.9 BB, I'm in the \"short stack\" territory. I need to be selective with my hands and preserve my chips for better spots. This is not a good hand to risk chips with.\n\n4. **Pot Odds:** I need to call 8 to win 12, which is 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not enough to justify playing such a weak hand.\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations:** With a short stack, I should be looking for spots to either shove (all-in) with strong hands or fold and wait for better opportunities. Playing marginal hands from early position with a short stack is a recipe for disaster.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, position is bad, and my stack size is too short to be playing such speculative hands. I should preserve my chips for a better opportunity.\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools here - this is a straightforward decision based on basic poker fundamentals. 2-5 offsuit is a fold in virtually any situation, especially UTG with a short stack.",

This is definitely a fold in most situations, but since I already posted the BB and it's just a check to see the flop, I need to consider checking.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Very tight player - folded preflop in 16 out of 20 recent hands\n- Only showed aggression with raises in hands 46 and 48\n- Made a flop bet in hand 43 after calling preflop\n- Called preflop in hand 43 then bet on flop\n- The call in this hand suggests they might have something decent\n\n**Position:**\nI'm out of position (BB) vs the button (seat 4). This is a disadvantage.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI'm at 16.9 BB which is still in the playable range but getting short. I should be selective with my hands.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nThe pot is 20 and it costs me 0 to check, so infinite pot odds to see the flop. But the real cost is the risk of losing more chips post-flop with a weak hand.\n\n**Decision:**\nWith 8s 3d, I have almost no chance of making a strong hand. Even though it's free to check, I'll be out of position against a tight player who called from the button. This suggests they have a decent hand. \n\nWith my tournament life at stake and a shortish stack, I should not invest any more chips in this pot with such a weak hand. The risk of getting trapped and losing more chips post-flop outweighs the benefit of seeing a free flop.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. Since the amount to call is 0, I can check and see the flop for free. The pot is 20 chips (8 from me, 4 from SB, 8 from MiniMax). \n\nHowever, with 8-3 offsuit, I'm very likely to be dominated even if I hit something. And I'll be out of position. The best case scenario is hitting two pair or trips, which is very unlikely (around 2% chance). \n\nGiven that MiniMax is tight and called from the button, they likely have a decent hand. If I check and hit any 8 or 3, I'll still be unsure if I'm ahead. This could lead to difficult decisions out of position.\n\nI think the disciplined play here is to fold. Even though it's \"free\" to see the flop, playing 8-3 offsuit out of position against a tight player is -EV. I should preserve my 135 chips for better spots.\n\nActually, I need to reconsider again. The pot is 20 chips and I already have 8 chips invested. If I fold, I lose those 8 chips for sure. If I check, I get to see if I can realize some equity. \n\nLet me think about the math. With 8-3 offsuit:\n- Probability of flopping a pair: ~26% (but could be dominated)\n- Probability of flopping two pair: ~2%\n- Probability of flopping trips: ~1.35%\n\nSo about 29% chance I'll flop something that looks good, but most of those times I'll have just a weak pair that could be dominated.\n\nGiven the opponent is tight and I'm out of position, I think checking to see the flop is actually fine. It's zero additional risk, and while I have very little equity, there's always a tiny chance I could hit big or bluff on certain board textures.\n\nBut actually, the more I think about it, the more I lean towards folding. With a tight player calling from the button, they have a real hand. With 8-3 offsuit and being out of position, even if I flop a pair of 8s, I'm likely behind their range which includes all better 8s, all pairs, etc. \n\nThis is a clear fold to preserve my tournament stack. I don't want to get into a difficult spot out of position with a weak hand against a tight player.\n\nWait, I'm confusing myself. Let me be clear:\n- Amount to call is 0\n- I can check for free\n- But I have the option to fold\n\nIn poker, you never fold when you can check for free. That would be burning equity, no matter how small. Even with 8-3 offsuit, I have some chance (however small) of hitting a disguised big hand or being able to bluff"

On this board:\n- I have no pair (8 high)\n- No flush draw (only one spade, one diamond)\n- No straight draw (no connection)\n- The board has two sixes and a Jack\n\n**Opponent:**\nOnly Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) is still in the hand. They called preflop from what position? Let me check the preflop actions:\n- Seat 5 posted SB\n- I posted BB\n- Seat 2 folded\n- Seat 3 folded\n- Seat 4 called 8 (from what position?)\n- Seat 5 folded\n- I checked\n\nSo Seat 4 is the only opponent. They called from what would be the button or cutoff position (since seats 2 and 3 folded, and seat 5 is SB). They have 275 chips (34.4 BB).\n\n**Decision:**\nI have absolutely nothing. The board is paired (6s), and my 8 high is very weak. I should check and see what the opponent does. If they bet, I'll almost certainly fold unless it's a very small bet and I have good odds (which is unlikely).\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools here because:\n1. The situation is very straightforward - I have a terrible hand\n2. I have no draws, no pair, nothing to continue with\n3. Checking is the obvious play\n\nI should check and see what my opponent does on the flop.",

They called preflop this hand but checked both flop and turn, suggesting they likely have a marginal hand or are trapping.\n\n**Action:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (it's checked to me)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\nWith 8 high on a board with two pairs (6s and J/Q), I have absolutely nothing. Checking is free, so I should check and see the river. There's no value in betting here as MiniMax-M2 would only call/raise with better hands. \n\nHowever, I could consider a bluff given that:\n1. The board is paired (6s), which can scare opponents\n\n\n2. I have a tight table image that might intimidate opponents\n3. A small bet could potentially steal the pot\n4. My stack size allows for a strategic move\n\nI'm weighing the risks of a potential bluff against the safety of checking. A strategic check seems most prudent given my weak hand and the potential for my opponent to have a stronger holding. The minimal pot size doesn't justify an aggressive move, so I'll cautiously check and hope for a favorable river card.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My Hand**: 8s 3d - This is a very weak hand with no connection to the board. I have no pair, no draw, nothing.\n\n**Board**: Jd 6d 6c Qd\n- There are two 6s on board (paired board)\n- Three diamonds (Jd, 6d, Qd) - flush draw possible\n- Straight possibilities with Q-J\n\n**Position**: I'm in BB, out of position against MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4.\n\n**Stack**: 135 chips (16.9 BB) - This is a short stack but not desperate yet.\n\n**Pot**: 28 chips\n- Preflop: SB 4 + BB 8 + call 8 = 20\n- Turn bet: 8 more, so 28 total\n\n**Action**: MiniMax-M2 bet 8 on the turn after we both checked the flop.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- Very tight preflop player (folded many hands)\n- Made a river bet in hand 37\n- Made a flop bet in hand 43\n- Made preflop raises in hands 46 and 48\n\nThis player seems to be tight-aggressive when they do play. The turn bet on this board suggests they likely have something. Given the board texture, they could have:\n- A flush (if they have diamonds)\n- A full house (if they have a 6)\n- A straight draw\n- Top pair with J or Q\n- Or they could be bluffing with the flush draw\n\n**My situation**: I have absolutely nothing. 8-high with no draw. The pot is 28 and I need to call 8, giving me 3.5:1 pot odds. But even with these odds, I have essentially 0% chance of winning this hand. I have no outs.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 16.9 BB, I'm short-stacked but not in desperation mode. I should preserve my chips for better spots. Calling here would be burning 8 chips (0.6 BB) with no chance of winning.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. I have no hand, no draw, and I'm facing a bet from a tight player. I need to preserve my stack for better opportunities.",

In a tournament with a short stack (16.4 BB), this is definitely a raise-worthy hand. I should be looking to either:\n1. Take down the blinds preflop\n2. Build a pot with a strong hand\n3. Potentially get all-in if the situation is right\n\nGiven my short stack, I should be playing aggressively with decent hands. Pocket sixes heads-up from the button is a premium spot.\n\nThe minimum raise is 16 chips (2x the BB). With 131 chips, a standard raise would be to about 2.5-3x BB = 20-24 chips. This is a good spot to raise to 24 (3x BB) to put pressure on the BB.\n\nLet me make a raise to 24 chips.",

I have to act first postflop, and all players behind me get to act after me.\n\n**Stack size**: 167 chips (10.4 BB) - This is a short stack in tournament poker. I'm in the danger zone where I need to be selective about when to commit chips.\n\n**Pot odds**: Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1), which is not great.\n\n**Opponent information**: Looking at the recent actions, I see that MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, the big blind) has been playing somewhat passively (checked flop, then bet 8 on turn in hand 59). The players behind me have been folding frequently in recent hands.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 10.4 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. K3 offsuit from UTG is a fold in almost all situations, especially with a short stack.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. K3 offsuit is a terrible hand from UTG, and with a short stack of only 10.4 BB, I cannot afford to call with marginal hands. I should wait for a better spot, preferably in position with a stronger hand where I can either shove or make a standard raise.",

It's not suited, not connected, and the 9 is a weak high card. This is definitely a folding hand, especially from UTG position.\n\n**Position considerations:**\nI'm UTG, the worst position. I have to act first on every street. Playing weak hands from UTG is a recipe for disaster.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 10.4 BB, which is getting short but not desperate yet. I need to be selective and wait for good spots to shove or make moves. This is NOT a good spot.\n\n**Opponent tendencies (from the data):**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been folding a lot preflop, but occasionally raises. Made a big raise of 157 chips in hand #62.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Very tight - folded every preflop in the last 10 hands recorded.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Generally tight, but did call once and made a small bet on turn in hand #59.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Mixed - some folds, one call. Generally seems to be playing straightforward.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 9-4 offsuit is in the bottom 10% of hands. From UTG with a short-ish stack, this is an easy fold. I need to preserve my chips for better spots, preferably when I'm in better position or have a stronger hand.\n\nThe pot odds are 16 to win 24 (1.5:1), but with this hand, even those odds don't justify calling. If I call, I'd be out of position with a very weak hand, and would likely have to fold to any aggression on later streets.\n \nI recognize the urgency of my dwindling chip stack, but this hand is clearly not worth the risk. Tournament survival demands patience and strategic chip preservation. I'll wait for a stronger hand or better position to make a move.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - This is good position\n- Cards: 5c Td (5 of clubs, 10 of diamonds) - This is offsuit, gap hand. Not very strong.\n- Stack: 151 chips (9.4 BB) - Short stacked\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- Action: SB (Seat 5) posted 8 and called the additional 8 to complete to 16\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nLooking at their recent history:\n- Very tight player - mostly folding (hands 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63)\n- Only called once (hand 54) and then folded\n- Only raised once (hand 45) with amount 24\n- This player is in SB position and just called to complete\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 5c Td is a weak hand, especially offsuit with a 5-gap\n- On the button, we have position advantage\n- We're short stacked with 9.4 BB\n- The opponent is very tight and just limped from SB\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak, but we have position\n2. **Stack size**: Short at 9.4 BB - we need to be careful but also look for spots to accumulate\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight player who limped - this suggests they don't have a premium hand\n4. **Pot odds**: There's 32 in pot, it costs us 0 to check. If we raise, minimum is 32.\n5. **Tournament**: With 9.4 BB, we need to preserve our stack but also can't be too passive\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Check**: Free flop with a weak hand in position. We can see if we hit something. \n2. **Raise**: Minimum raise to 32 (2x BB). This would be about 21% of our stack. Given how tight opponent is, a raise might take it down preflop. But if they call, we're out of position post-flop with a weak hand.\n\n**Recommendation**: Check. Here's why:\n- Our hand is too weak to invest 21% of our short stack\n- We have position, so we can see a free flop\n- The opponent is tight, so if we hit something decent, we might get value\n- If we miss, we can easily fold with minimal loss\n- Raising with this hand commits too much of our stack with poor equity\n\nLet me check what the minimum raise is again. It says \"Minimum raise to: 32\". Since the big blind is 16, a minimum raise would be to 32 total (an additional 16). That would be 32 chips from our 151 stack, which is about 21% of our stack. That's too much for this weak hand.\n\nChecking is the correct play here.",

No pair, no draw, just T-high.\n- The board has Q-K which could easily hit opponent's range.\n- I have a backdoor flush draw with Td, but it's very weak.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n- Very tight player - mostly folding preflop\n- Only called once (hand 54) and folded preflop\n- Made one preflop raise in hand 45\n- Only postflop action seen was a fold on flop in hand 43\n- This is their first postflop bet we've seen\n\nGiven that they're typically very tight and are now betting 80 into a 112 pot (a large bet), this likely represents significant strength. They're betting ~71% of pot with a tight player's range.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 112\n- To call: 80\n- Pot odds: 112:80 or 1.4:1\n- I need ~42% equity to call\n\n**My equity:**\nWith T-high on a Q-K board, I have essentially 0% equity against any reasonable betting range. Even if they're bluffing, I have no showdown value.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 9.4 BB left, which is short but not desperate\n- Calling 80 would leave me with only 71 chips (4.4 BB)\n- This would severely cripple my stack\n- Preserving my stack for better spots is crucial\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. I have no hand, no draw, facing a large bet from a tight player, and calling would decimate my stack. The only consideration is that they're in SB vs my BB, so they could be defending wide, but given their tight history, this bet likely means business.\n\nI should fold and preserve my 151 chips for a better opportunity.",

This is critical. With less than 10 big blinds, I need to be much more selective about which hands I play. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call raises with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Action**: Everyone folded to me on the button. I only need to call 8 chips (0.5 BB) to see the flop. The small blind is already posted.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: There's 24 chips in the pot and I need to call 8, giving me 3:1 pot odds.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 8.9 BB, I should be in push/fold mode. Calling with a weak hand like J4o is -EV. If I call and miss the flop (which is likely), I'll have wasted 8 chips and be in a tough spot postflop. If I raise, I'd need to make it at least 32 chips, which commits over 20% of my stack with a terrible hand.\n\nThe correct play here is to fold. I need to preserve my chips for better spots, preferably when I have a stronger hand and can shove preflop. J4o is not worth playing even from the button with this stack size.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent in Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been very tight - mostly folding preflop. They just raised to 48 from early position (relative to the blinds). This suggests they have a strong hand.\n\nMy hand is Q\u2665J\u2665 - suited connectors, which is a decent hand but not premium. I'm on the button, which is good position. However, I only have 143 chips (8.9 BB), so I'm in short stack territory.\n\nLet me think about this:\n- Pot is 72, I need to call 48\n- This gives me pot odds of 72:48 or 1.5:1\n- If I call, I'll have 95 chips left (5.9 BB)\n- If I raise, minimum is 80, which would leave me with 63 chips\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 has been very tight and is now raising from early position, they likely have a strong range (AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe JJ, TT, AQ). My QJs is behind most of that range.\n\nWith my short stack, I should be looking for spots to either:\n1. Shove all-in with a strong hand\n2. Fold marginal hands and preserve chips\n\nQJs is marginal against a tight early position raiser. If I call, I'll be out of position postflop (well, I'll be in position on the button, but with only 5.9 BB left, I'm basically committed if I hit anything).\n\nActually wait - I'm ON THE BUTTON (Seat 1), so I have position. That helps. But still, with 8.9 BB, I need to be careful.\n\nLet me reconsider the pot odds. Pot is 72, I need to call 48. That's 72:48 = 1.5:1. I need 40% equity to call. Against a tight EP range (AA-QQ, AK, maybe JJ), QJs has about 35-40% equity. It's close.\n\nBut tournament equity matters too. If I lose this hand, I'm down to 95 chips (5.9 BB). If I win, I go up to 191 chips (11.9 BB).\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot and now raises, this is likely a strong hand. \n\nI'm facing a tough decision with Q\u2665J\u2665. The raiser's tight play suggests a strong hand, and my stack size makes this a critical moment. The pot odds are marginal, and calling would significantly reduce my remaining chips. While the suited connectors have some potential, the risk of losing a substantial portion of my stack outweighs the potential upside. I need to preserve my tournament life and wait for a more favorable opportunity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  My hand is A4 suited (Ah 4h). Let me think about this situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A4 suited is a marginal hand, especially from early position. It's weak kicker with the ace, and the 4 doesn't help much. The suitedness gives some flush potential but it's still a weak hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. I'll be out of position against everyone else for the entire hand. This significantly reduces the playability of marginal hands.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 143 chips which is 8.9 BB. This is a short stack in tournament play. With a short stack, I should be looking to either:\n   - Fold marginal hands to preserve my stack\n   - Shove all-in with strong hands to avoid post-flop play and maximize fold equity\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With only 8.9 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I shouldn't be making standard raises with marginal hands from early position. If I play this hand, I should either fold or shove all-in.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: I don't have specific reads on these opponents yet, but with a short stack, my primary concern should be hand selection and position.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 24 and I need to call 16, giving me 1.5:1 odds. But this is irrelevant because I shouldn't be calling with this hand from this position with my stack size.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold. A4 suited is too weak to play from UTG with a short stack. If I were to play it, I should shove all-in (143 chips), but that's too aggressive for this weak hand. The correct play is to fold and wait for a better spot, preferably with a stronger hand or better position.\n\nLet me make the fold decision:",

The short stack could be shoving with any ace, any pair, or decent broadway cards, all of which have me dominated or flipping at best. I should preserve my stack for a better spot where I can be the aggressor or have better equity.\n\nI need to fold here.",

Not a good hand to play.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position, but I only have 7.4 BB left - this is a short stack situation.\n\n3. **Opponent**: The BB is Kimi-K2 with 165 chips (10.3 BB). Looking at their recent actions, they've been very tight - folding 8 out of 9 recent preflop hands, with one all-in raise in hand #62. This suggests they're playing very tight.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to win 24 chips, which is 3:1 pot odds.\n\n5. **Tournament situation**: With only 7.4 BB, I'm in critical short stack territory. I need to be looking for spots to shove or fold. With a hand as weak as J8o, this is not a good spot to invest chips.\n\n6. **Action**: The BB is very tight, so if I call, they might check-fold a lot of flops. However, J8o is just too weak, and I don't want to invest 8 chips (0.5 BB) with such a marginal hand when I'm this short.\n\nThe correct play here is to fold. I need to preserve my chips for better spots, preferably with stronger hands or better situations to shove. Calling with J8o on the button with 7.4 BB is not profitable in the long run.",

I need to be very careful with my chips.\n\n**Pot**: 24 chips\n**To call**: 8 chips\n**Minimum raise**: 32 chips\n\n**Opponent information**: Looking at the recall data for the BB (Seat 2):\n- They've been very tight, folding most hands (hands 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 71, 73)\n- They raised twice: hand 62 with a big raise of 157 (likely all-in or close to it) and hand 72 with 40\n- They showed down Kd 9h in hand 30, which is a marginal hand\n\nThe opponent seems to be playing tight overall, which makes sense given tournament dynamics.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: J4o is one of the worst hands in poker. It has very little potential.\n2. **Stack size**: At 7.4 BB, I need to preserve my chips for better spots. I cannot afford to waste 8 chips (0.5 BB) on a marginal call.\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, getting 3:1 odds. While this might seem okay, J4o will rarely hit a strong enough hand to justify the investment.\n4. **Position**: Even on the button, J4o is too weak to play profitably.\n5. **Opponent tendency**: The BB is tight, which means if I call and they bet postflop, I'll likely be forced to fold.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With a short stack of 7.4 BB, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold. Calling with a weak hand like J4o is not optimal. I should either:\n- Fold and wait for a better hand/spot\n- Consider raising if I want to steal, but the min raise is 32 chips (27% of my stack), which is too much to risk with J4o\n\nThe correct play here is to fold. I need to preserve my chips for better opportunities where I have stronger hands or better situations (like being the first to act in late position with a marginal hand I can shove).\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"J4o is too weak to play with a short stack of 7.4 BB.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 3d 9d - This is a weak hand, unsuited and disconnected, even though it's suited. In poker terms, this is a \"trash hand\" that should almost always be folded.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is good position, but with a weak hand like this, position doesn't help enough.\n\n**Stack**: 119 chips (7.4 BB) - I'm in the danger zone with less than 10 big blinds. I need to be very selective about when I commit chips.\n\n**Blinds**: 8/16 - The blinds are significant relative to my stack.\n\n**Pot**: 24 chips (1.5 BB)\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 has been active with raises, including some big ones (157, 40, 48). They seem aggressive.\n- Seat 4 (BB): MiniMax-M2 has also been raising, with amounts ranging from 4 to 48 chips. They also seem aggressive and have shown down strong hands like pocket 8s, AJ, and JTs.\n\n**Action**: \n- SB posted 8\n- BB posted 16\n- Seat 5 folded\n- It's on me (BTN) with 16 to call\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 3d9d is extremely weak. Even with the diamond suit, this is a fold 99%+ of the time.\n2. **Stack size**: With only 7.4 BB, I cannot afford to waste chips on marginal hands. I need to preserve my stack for better spots.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents in the blinds have shown aggression. If I call, I'm likely facing a raise from one or both of them.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1). With my hand, this is not enough.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a short stack, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold. Calling with a weak hand and being out of position post-flop is a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe only consideration could be if I want to try a steal, but with my hand being so weak and both opponents showing aggression, a steal attempt would be ill-advised. Even if I raise, I'd have to raise to at least 32 (2x BB), which would commit over 25% of my stack with a trash hand.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold situation given my hand strength, stack size, and opponent tendencies.",

Ace-Queen offsuit is definitely playable.\n\n2. **My position**: UTG (Seat 1) - This is the worst position preflop since I'm first to act. Playing from UTG requires stronger hands.\n\n3. **My stack**: 119 chips (7.4 BB) - I'm in the short stack territory. With less than 10 big blinds, I'm in push/fold territory, but I have enough chips to make a standard raise.\n\n4. **Opponents**:\n   - Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (205 chips) - Recent actions show mostly folding, but did raise to 40 in hand 72\n   - Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 (304 chips) - Recent actions show mostly folding, called 90 in hand 69\n   - Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B (188 chips) - Recent actions show mostly folding\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1) - not great immediate odds, but with a strong hand like AQ, this is a clear call or raise.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 7.4 BB, I need to be thinking about survival but also chip accumulation. AQ from UTG is strong enough to play, but I need to be careful.\n\nGiven that I'm UTG with a short stack (7.4 BB), I have a few options:\n- **Fold**: Too tight with AQ. This is a premium hand in this situation.\n- **Call**: Could be okay, but being out of position with a short stack is problematic. If I just call and miss the flop, I'm in a tough spot.\n- **Raise**: The standard play. With 7.4 BB, I should either shove all-in or make a standard raise.\n\nLooking at the raise sizing: Minimum raise is 32 (to 48 total). If I raise to 32, that would leave me with 87 chips. If I get called and miss the flop, I'll be in an awkward spot.\n\nWith 7.4 BB and AQ from UTG, the correct tournament play is often to shove all-in. This achieves several things:\n1. Maximizes fold equity\n2. Avoids difficult post-flop decisions out of position\n3. Gets maximum value when called by weaker hands\n4. Puts pressure on the bigger stacks\n\nThe opponents have been folding a lot preflop recently, so there's good fold equity. Even if I get called, AQ is in good shape against most calling ranges from the big stacks.\n\nLet me go all-in for 119 chips.",

This is a clear fold. I'm short stacked, facing a raise from a tight player, with a marginal hand that doesn't play well against a tight raising range. I should preserve my chips for a better spot, preferably with a stronger hand or in a steal situation.",

In hand 78, they raised preflop to 32 and then made a big raise on the flop to 148. Their showdowns show they play reasonable hands (AdJs, 7cJs, 5hQh).\n\n**My situation**: \n- I have a small pocket pair with 7.4 BB left\n- I'm getting pot odds: 48 to win 72 = 1.5:1, which is not great for a small pair\n- With a small pair, I'm usually flipping against overcards (50/50) or dominated against higher pairs (20/80)\n- I need to get lucky and hit a set to have a strong hand\n- If I call 48, I'll have 71 chips left (4.4 BB)\n- If I raise all-in to 119, I'm risking my tournament life with a marginal hand\n- The raiser has been tight, suggesting they likely have a strong hand range\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \nWith only 7.4 BB, I need to make a move soon, but 44 is not a great hand to do it with. I should wait for a better spot, preferably with a hand that has better equity against a tight raiser's range, or when I'm first to act.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. I don't have the odds to call, and going all-in with 44 against a tight player who just raised 3x is -EV. I should preserve my chips for a better spot.",

This is a standard tournament play with a short stack and a premium hand. I want to maximize fold equity and get value from my strong hand. Even if called, AK has good equity against most calling ranges.\n\nThe minimum raise is 64, and I can raise to my full stack of 87 (all-in).",

They could be:\n  1. Slow-playing a monster (set, two pair)\n  2. Have a draw (flush draw, straight draw)\n  3. Have a weaker King\n  4. Have nothing and giving up\n\n**Given my stack size:**\nWith only 32 chips left and a pot of 174 chips, I should absolutely be willing to commit my stack here. I have top pair, top kicker. Even if my opponent has a set or two pair, I still have equity. And if they have a draw, I want to charge them or get them to fold.\n\n**But wait - I can only check or fold.** The legal actions are \"fold\" and \"check\". This is strange because normally I'd want to bet here. Let me think about this...\n\nActually, the minimum raise is listed as 55, but my stack is only 32. So I cannot raise to 55 because I don't have enough chips. The system is saying my legal actions are fold or check, but I should be able to go all-in for 32.\n\nLet me reconsider - perhaps the system is limiting me because I don't have enough for the minimum raise, and it's not offering me an all-in option? That would be odd.\n\nActually, looking at the rules: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So I should be able to go all-in here. But the legal actions shown don't include a raise option.\n\nWait, let me re-read: \"Legal actions: fold, check\". So I cannot raise. This is strange given the rules stated. But I must follow what's given.\n\nGiven that I can only check or fold:\n- Folding would be absolutely terrible with top pair, top kicker and a pot of 174 when I only have 32 left\n- Checking is the obvious choice\n\nBut this feels wrong. With my stack size and hand strength, I want to get my chips in.

Let me trace:\n\nPreflop:\n- I posted BB 32 (so I had at least 32)\n- Seat 5 called 16 (from SB to make it 32 total)\n- I raised 87 - but I only had 32 initially. This suggests I went all-in for 32, but it was recorded as 87? Or the numbers are wrong.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: \"Your Stack: 32 chips (1.0 BB)\" - this is likely my CURRENT stack after the preflop action. So after posting the BB and making a raise, I have 32 left.\n\nLet me recalculate the preflop:\n- Initial: I have 32 + 87 = 119 chips?

They could be:\n  1. Slow-playing a monster (set, two pair)\n  2. Have a draw (flush draw, straight draw)\n  3. Have a weaker King\n  4. Have nothing and giving up\n\n**Given my stack size:**\nWith only 32 chips left and a pot of 174 chips, I should absolutely be willing to commit my stack here. I have top pair, top kicker. Even if my opponent has a set or two pair, I still have equity. And if they have a draw, I want to charge them or get them to fold.\n\n**But wait - I can only check or fold.** The legal actions are \"fold\" and \"check\". This is strange because normally I'd want to bet here. Let me think about this...\n\nActually, the minimum raise is listed as 55, but my stack is only 32. So I cannot raise to 55 because I don't have enough chips. The system is saying my legal actions are fold or check, but I should be able to go all-in for 32.\n\nLet me reconsider - perhaps the system is limiting me because I don't have enough for the minimum raise, and it's not offering me an all-in option? That would be odd.\n\nActually, looking at the rules: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So I should be able to go all-in here. But the legal actions shown don't include a raise option.\n\nWait, let me re-read: \"Legal actions: fold, check\". So I cannot raise. This is strange given the rules stated. But I must follow what's given.\n\nGiven that I can only check or fold:\n- Folding would be absolutely terrible with top pair, top kicker and a pot of 174 when I only have 32 left\n- Checking is the obvious choice\n\nBut this feels wrong. With my stack size and hand strength, I want to get my chips in. Let me think if there's any scenario where checking is better...\n\nActually, checking might induce a bluff from my opponent on the turn. But with my tiny stack, I should just get it in now.

This is a very strong hand given the board texture. There's a flush draw on the flop (Js Ks 3h) but the 3d on the turn doesn't complete it. No straight draws are obvious.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good position.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, I can see GPT-OSS-120B:\n   - Has been fairly tight (folded many hands preflop)\n   - When they do play, they can be aggressive (raised 106 in hand 69, raised 148 on flop in hand 78)\n   - In hand 68, they bet 64 on flop then folded on turn\n   - In hand 69, they checked turn then called a small bet (8)\n   - They check-folded to my 87 chip raise preflop in this hand, then called 55 more\n\n4. **Action analysis**: \n   - Preflop: I raised to 87, opponent called 55 (showing some strength)\n   - Flop: I checked, opponent checked (showing some caution)\n   - Turn: Opponent checked to me\n\n5. **Stack considerations**: I only have 32 chips left which is exactly 1 BB. This is a critical tournament situation - I'm extremely short-stacked. The pot is already 174 chips, which is massive relative to my stack.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: If I bet my remaining 32 chips, I'm betting into a 174 chip pot. This is an easy decision.\n\n**Decision**: I should definitely check here. Here's why:\n- I'm extremely short-stacked (1 BB) and need to be very careful\n- My hand is strong (top pair, top kicker with two pair on board)\n- The opponent has shown caution by checking turn\n- If I bet my remaining 32 chips, I risk being called by better hands\n- Checking gives me a chance to see the river for free and potentially win at showdown\n- Given my tiny stack relative to the pot, preserving chips is crucial\n\nI should check and hope to get to showdown with my strong hand.",

Let me analyze this:\n\nMy hand: Kc Ac\nBoard: Js Ks 3h 3d 5h\n\nThis gives me two pair, Kings and Threes, with an Ace kicker. \n\nPot: 174 chips\nMy stack: 32 chips (1.0 BB)\nOpponent (Seat 5 GPT-OSS-120B): 213 chips\n\nThe action sequence shows:\n- Preflop: I raised to 87, opponent called 55 (so they invested significant chips)\n- Flop: Opponent checked, I checked\n- Turn: Opponent checked, I checked  \n- River: Opponent checked\n\nNow it's on me to act with 0 to call. My legal actions are fold or check.\n\nAnalysis:\n1. Hand strength: I have two pair (Kings and Threes) with Ace kicker. This is a strong hand, but the board has some dangers:\n   - Flush draw was possible (two spades on flop: Js Ks)\n   - Straight draw was possible (but unlikely with this board)\n   - Full house is possible if opponent has a 3 (trips)\n   - Better two pair is possible if opponent has KJ\n\n2. Given that opponent called my preflop raise of 87 chips, they likely have something decent. The fact that they've checked all streets suggests they might be weak, but they could also be slow-playing a strong hand.\n\n3. My stack is only 32 chips left (1 BB), which is extremely short. The pot is 174 chips.\n\n4. If I check, I get to showdown for free and potentially win 174 chips with my two pair.\n\n5. If I bet (I could shove my remaining 32 chips), I might get called by worse hands or get folds from hands that might beat me.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have a strong but vulnerable hand\n- My stack is extremely short (1 BB)\n- The opponent has shown weakness by checking all streets\n- I have 0 to call so I can see showdown for free\n\nThe safe and correct play here is to check and go to showdown. There's no value in betting my last 32 chips when I can see the showdown for free, especially since my hand is strong but not the nuts. Checking preserves my chance to win the 174 chip pot without risking my remaining stack.\n\nI should check.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 7s Qc - This is a marginal hand, offsuit and not connected. Q7o is generally a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. This is a significant advantage.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 190 chips (5.9 BB) - This is very short stacked, nearing the critical zone. We're in tournament play where survival matters.\n\n4. **Current action**: \n   - I posted SB (16)\n   - BB posted 32\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 32\n   - Seat 5 folded\n   - I need to call 16 more to see the flop\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 80 chips, I need to call 16. That's 5:1 pot odds. This is very attractive pot odds.\n\n6. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n   - Very tight player - folded preflop in 7 of last 10 hands\n   - When they did play (hand 78), they called preflop and then bet on the flop\n   - They seem to play straightforwardly - tight preflop, aggressive when they hit\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With only 5.9 BB, I need to be very careful. However, I'm getting 5:1 pot odds on my call, and I'm in position. The call is only 16 chips, which is about 8% of my stack. Even though Q7o is weak, the combination of position, pot odds, and the fact that MiniMax-M2 seems tight makes this a borderline call.\n\n8. **Strategic thinking**: \n   - If I call, I have position post-flop\n   - MiniMax-M2 likely has a decent but not premium hand (they called, didn't raise)\n   - I can easily fold if I miss the flop\n   - The investment is small relative to pot size\n   - However, with my short stack, I should be looking for better spots to get my money in\n\n9. **Decision**: While the pot odds are good and I have position, Q7o is just too weak, especially with my short stack. I should preserve my chips for a better spot where I can shove or make a stand with a stronger hand. The 16 chips represent about 8% of my stack, which isn't huge, but tournament survival is key here.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The pot odds are 5:1, I'm on the button, and it's only costing me 16 chips (8% of stack). If I hit a Q on the flop, I could be good against a tight player who might have weaker Qx or be overplaying a medium pair. Plus, I can easily fold if I miss. The combination of position and pot odds might make this a profitable call.\n\nBut wait - with 5.9 BB, I should be thinking about push/fold. Calling with marginal hands like this can lead to difficult post-flop situations where I bleed chips. The standard play with <10 BB is to either shove or fold preflop, not call.\n\nHowever, since I already have 16 invested as the SB, and I only need to call 16 more to win 80, that's excellent pot odds. This is a special situation because of the posted blind.\n\nLet me think about this differently: if I had 0 invested and it folded to me on the BTN with Q7o and 5.9 BB, I should fold. But I've already invested 16 chips (the SB). \n\nI realize the SB is a sunk cost. Tournament ICM considerations are crucial here. With extremely short stacks, every chip matters. Despite the tempting pot odds, my marginal hand and vulnerable position make folding the most prudent choice. The potential to lose more chips outweighs the slim chance of winning this hand.",

This looks like a strong hand trying to isolate or protect against the short-stacked BB.\n\nThe decision is clear: FOLD. This hand is not worth 149 chips (62.6% of my stack) with J8 offsuit.

At this stack depth, it's either shove or fold, and the combination of position and opponent tendencies makes this a profitable shove.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - this is the best position postflop\n- Cards: 9h Ac (Ace-nine offsuit)\n- Stack: 238 chips (7.4 BB) - I'm short-stacked\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- To call: 32 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - 133 chips (short stack), posted SB\n- Seat 4 (BB): MiniMax-M2 - 208 chips, posted BB\n- Seat 5 folded\n\nFrom the recall data:\n- **Kimi-K2 (SB)**: Folding a lot preflop (folded 8 of last 10 hands), only raised once. Seems tight/passive. Only showdown was K9o making two pair.\n\n- **MiniMax-M2 (BB)**: Also folding a lot preflop, but when they call (hand 82, 84), they bet aggressively on the flop. Showdowns show they play hands like JTc, AJ, and 88. Seems to defend their blind but then leads out aggressively.\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Ace-nine offsuit is a marginal hand, especially with a 9 kicker. It's dominated by many Ax hands.\n\n2. **Position**: Button is great postflop, but with only 7.4 BB, we're looking for spots to either shove or fold.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: I'm short at 7.4 BB. The SB is even shorter at 4.2 BB. The BB has 6.5 BB.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: At this stack depth, I should be looking to either fold or shove (push all-in). A standard raise would commit too much of my stack.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: SB is tight and folds a lot. BB defends but then bets aggressively postflop, which could be problematic with Ace-high.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nWith Ace-nine on the button and 7.4 BB, this is a borderline hand. However:\n- The SB is very tight and likely to fold to pressure\n- The BB defends but then leads out aggressively, making it hard to play Ace-high postflop\n\n\n- I have position, which is valuable\n- The pot is 48 and I need to call 32, giving me 1.5:1 immediate odds\n\nI see a clear opportunity to apply maximum pressure. Shoving all-in creates fold equity against the tight SB and potentially the BB. With my short stack, this move maximizes my chances of winning the blinds and antes. The aggressive BB might be forced to fold marginal hands, and my position gives me an additional edge. This is a classic short-stack tournament play that could significantly boost my chip count.\n\nThe key is leveraging my positional advantage and the opponents' tendencies to create a high-pressure situation that favors my current stack size. A shove represents strength and could extract folds from both opponents.",

Need to accumulate chips to survive, and AQ is strong enough to race if called.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: Ad Qh (Ace-Queen offsuit) - This is a strong starting hand, especially in late position. From UTG it's still playable but requires caution.\n\n**My Stack**: 286 chips (8.9 BB) - This is a short stack. I need to be thinking about survival and looking for spots to accumulate chips.\n\n**Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position. I have to act first post-flop.\n\n**Blinds**: 16/32 - The blinds are quite high relative to stacks.\n\n**Pot**: 48 chips\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): 181 chips (5.7 BB) - very short\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 192 chips (6 BB) - short\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 133 chips (4.2 BB) - very short\n\nLooking at the opponent action history:\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, BB) has been folding a lot preflop. In hand 86 they made a big raise of 165 (which would be all-in for them now). They seem to play tight but can make moves.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB) has been folding a lot preflop, very tight.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has also been folding a lot, but made a raise to 133 in hand 88.\n\nGiven I'm UTG with a short stack (8.9 BB), I need to think about tournament survival. AQ is a strong hand but from early position with a short stack, I have a few options:\n\n1. **Fold**: Too tight with AQ and only 8.9 BB. I need to accumulate chips.\n2. **Call (32 chips)**: This would leave me with 254 chips (7.9 BB). The problem is I'll be out of position post-flop, which is bad with AQ.\n3. **Raise**: With 8.9 BB, I should either go all-in or make a standard raise.\n\nGiven my stack size and the fact that I'm UTG, this is actually a good spot to go all-in. Here's why:\n- I have a strong hand (AQ)\n- My stack is short enough that I don't have post-flop playability anyway\n- Going all-in creates maximum fold equity against the short stacks behind me\n- The players behind me have shown tendencies to fold preflop\n- I need to accumulate chips to survive\n\nThe players in the blinds are very short:\n- SB has 192 chips (6 BB)\n- BB has 133 chips (4.2 BB)\n\nIf I go all-in for 286 chips:\n- The BB would need to call 254 more into a pot of 334 (48+286), getting about 1.3:1 odds\n- The SB would need to call 270 more into a pot of 318, getting about 1.2:1 odds\n\nBoth would be getting poor odds to call with marginal hands.\n\nThis is a classic short-stack push/fold spot.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 7d 7h - Pocket sevens, a decent pair but vulnerable\n2. **Position**: SB - Bad position postflop\n3. **My stack**: 121 chips (3.8 BB) - Very short stacked\n4. **Blinds**: 16/32\n5. **Pot**: 112 chips\n6. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 64\n7. **To call**: 48\n8. **Legal**: fold, call, raise\n\nLooking at opponent history:\n- GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop (hands 85, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 93)\n- They did raise once for 165 chips (hand 86) - likely all-in or big raise\n- They called once for 133 chips (hand 92)\n- They folded on the flop in hand 84\n\nGiven my short stack of 121 chips (3.8 BB), I'm in a critical tournament situation. With 77, I need to consider:\n\n**If I call 48**: \n- I'll have 73 chips left (2.3 BB)\n- Pot will be 160 chips\n- I'll be out of position postflop\n- If I don't hit a set (which is 12% chance), I'm in trouble\n\n**If I raise**: \n- Minimum raise to 96, which leaves me 25 chips\n- This is basically committing my stack\n- Could shove all-in for 121\n\n**If I fold**:\n- I lose 16 chips from SB\n- I have 105 chips left (3.3 BB)\n\nWith a short stack of under 4 BB, pocket sevens is actually a strong hand. The raiser has been folding a lot, suggesting they might be raising with a wide range. \n\nGiven my stack size and the pot odds:\n- Calling 48 to win 112 = 43% pot odds\n- 77 against a wide range has decent equity\n- I'm short stacked and need to make a move soon\n\nThe best play here is likely to **shove all-in**. Here's why:\n1. With 3.8 BB, I don't have room to play postflop poker\n2. 77 is a strong hand in this situation\n3. I have fold equity against the raiser\n4. Even if called, I have decent equity against most ranges\n5. The pot is already 112, and I can win 64 from the raiser plus blinds\n \nI'll push my entire stack of 121 chips, capitalizing on my short-stack situation and the potential fold equity against the raiser. This move maximizes my chances of staying alive in the tournament with a decent pocket pair.",

The amount to call is 57, but I only have 16 chips. In poker, when facing a bet larger than your stack, you can call by going all-in for your remaining chips.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With such massive pot odds (22.7:1), I should call with almost any hand that has any chance of winning. Pocket 7s certainly qualifies. Even if the opponent has a Ten, I have 2 outs (the remaining 7s). Against an overpair, I have 2 outs. Against two overcards, I might be ahead.\n\nGiven that I'm extremely short stacked and getting incredible pot odds, I should call and hope my 7s hold up or improve. This is likely a +EV play given the pot odds.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. The pot is 363 and I have 16 left. If I call 16, the final pot would be 363 + 16 = 379. I'm risking 16 to win 363, which is 22.7:1. I need 4.2% equity.\n\nWith pocket 7s:\n- If opponent has a Ten: I'm ~8% to win (2 outs)\n- If opponent has an overpair: I'm ~8% to win (2 outs)\n- If opponent has two overcards: I'm ~50-70% to win\n- If opponent has a flush draw: I'm ~60% to win\n- If opponent has a straight draw: I'm ~60% to win\n\nGiven the opponent is tight, they're more likely to have a made hand (pair of Tens or better) than a draw.

I only need ~4.2% equity to break even.\n\n2. **Hand strength**: I have pocket 7s on a Th 2d 5h board. This is an underpair to the board.\n\n3. **Opponent**: Seat 2 is very tight (folded preflop 8/10 times). They called a raise preflop and now bet on the flop. A tight player betting here likely has:\n   - A pair of Tens or better\n   - Possibly a strong draw\n\n4. **Equity**: Even against a strong range, my pocket 7s likely has more than 4.2% equity:\n   - Against a pair of Tens: ~8% (2 outs)\n   - Against two overcards: ~50-70%\n   - Against a flush draw: ~60%\n\n5. **Tournament situation**: I'm extremely short stacked at 0.5 BB. This is a situation where I need to take any +EV spot to survive.\n\nGiven the massive pot odds (22.7:1), I only need 4.2% equity, and I likely have more than that even against a strong range from a tight player. I should call and go all-in.\n\nThe decision is: call (by going all-in for 16 chips).\n\nLet me format the response correctly as JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Getting 22.7:1 pot odds (363:16), needing only 4.2% equity.

Only raised once (133 chips) and called once (89 chips) in recent hands. At showdown, had Kd9h and Kd6h - playing weak Kings. Now extremely short stacked with 28 chips.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): Extremely tight, folding almost every hand preflop. Only showed down strong hands like AJ, JT, and pocket 8s.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 9h 5d is a terrible hand, unsuited and disconnected. One of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n2. **Stack size**: I'm short stacked at 8.6 BB, but not desperate yet. I should be selective with my shoves.\n\n3. **Opponent situation**: \n   - SB has only 28 chips and is very tight. They might shove or fold.\n   - BB is extremely tight and has 5 BB. They'll likely only call with premium hands.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 to win 48 (1.5:1), which is 40% equity needed. Even against two random hands, 95o has only about 30% equity.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 8.6 BB, I need to be careful but I'm not in push/fold mode yet. I should wait for a better spot.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. My hand is terrible, I'm not desperate enough to gamble with 95o, and both opponents are short-stacked and likely to shove if I just call. I should preserve my chips for a better opportunity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have Td 9h - a suited connector but not suited (different suits). This is a marginal hand, especially from early position (UTG).\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in UTG (Under the Gun), which is the worst position preflop. I have 5 players still to act behind me.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 274 chips = 8.6 BB. This is a short stack in tournament terms. With a stack this short, I need to be very selective about which hands I play.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the recall, I can see:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been folding a lot preflop\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been active, making raises and calls\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) is very short stacked with only 12 chips\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 32 chips to win a pot of 48 chips, which is 1.5:1 odds. This would require me to win ~40% of the time to break even.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With only 8.6 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. Playing marginal hands like T9o from early position is generally a losing play. I should be looking for spots to either shove with strong hands or fold and wait for better opportunities.\n\n7. **Action**: The blinds are 16/32, so calling 32 chips would cost me about 12% of my stack. If I call and miss the flop (which will happen most of the time), I'll be in a difficult spot with an even shorter stack.\n\n8. **Alternative**: Folding preserves my stack and allows me to wait for a better hand or position.\n\nGiven all these factors, especially my short stack size, poor position, and marginal hand strength, the correct play is to fold. T9o from UTG with 8.6 BB is simply not strong enough to justify the investment.",

From the BTN, it's a good hand to play, especially in a heads-up situation. It has good potential for straights and flushes.\n\n**Position & Stack:**\n- I'm on the BTN (best position)\n- I have a very short stack of only 7.6 BB\n- This is a critical stack size - I need to be looking for spots to shove or fold\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nLooking at their recent actions:\n- Very passive player - lots of folds and checks\n- They limped from SB this hand (called 16)\n- In hand 96, they checked down all streets\n- In hand 94, they raised to 64 then folded\n- In hand 86, they raised to 165 (probably all-in or close to it)\n- In hand 92, they called 133\n\nThis player seems passive and tends to fold to aggression. They limped from SB, which suggests weakness.\n\n**Decision:**\nWith a short stack of 7.6 BB and JTs on the BTN against a limper, this is a clear shove spot. \n\n1. **Fold equity**: Against a passive player who limps, I likely have good fold equity\n2. **Hand equity**: JTs has good equity against a typical limping range\n3. **Stack size**: At 7.6 BB, I need to accumulate chips or get eliminated\n4. **Position**: Being on the BTN is advantageous\n\nThe minimum raise is 64, but with my stack of 242, I should just shove all-in for 242. This puts maximum pressure on the opponent and gives me two ways to win: they fold, or they call and I have decent equity.\n\n\nI'll go all-in with my 242-chip stack, leveraging my position and the opponent's passive tendencies. This aggressive move maximizes my chances of either winning the pot immediately or having solid equity if called.",

The blinds are 16/32, so I have about 9 big blinds left.\n\nI need to call 16 chips to see the flop. The pot is currently 48 chips, so I'm getting 3:1 pot odds (48:16).\n\nHowever, with 4-2 offsuit, I have virtually no chance of making a strong hand. Even if I hit a pair, it's likely to be dominated. The only real hope is making two pair or a straight, but the odds are extremely low.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been fairly active preflop - calling in several hands, folding in others. They have a very short stack of only 4 chips (0.125 BB), which means they're basically all-in for any bet.\n\nGiven my extremely weak hand and short stack situation, I should fold. With 9 BB, I need to be very selective and wait for a better spot. Calling with 4-2 offsuit is just burning chips.\n\nI could consider a raise as a steal attempt since I'm on the button and the BB only has 4 chips, but it's not worth risking chips with this hand. Even if the BB folds, I'm not gaining much (just 32 chips), and if they call (which they likely would with any hand given their stack size), I'm in terrible shape.\n\nDecision: FOLD",

Let me re-read...\n\nOh, I see: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (out)\" - this means they're out of the hand, but the action shows \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 186\". This seems contradictory. Let me think about this...\n\nActually, looking at the opponent actions I just recalled, GPT-OSS-120B has been active in recent hands, so the \"0 chips (out)\" might be their current stack after posting blinds or something. But they just raised 186, which is a massive raise.\n\nThe raise is 186 chips. I have 290 total. The pot is 234. I need to call 186 to see a flop.\n\nWith 5h 2c, this is a terrible hand. Even in position, calling 186 chips (64% of my stack) with 52 offsuit is a clear fold. I'm getting pot odds of 234:186 or about 1.26:1, which is nowhere near enough for this hand.\n\nEven if I consider implied odds, 52 offsuit has almost no potential. The only way I win is if I hit a perfect flop like 5-5-2 or 5-2-X, which is extremely unlikely.\n\nLet me check if there are any ICM considerations. Seat 2 only has 36 chips (1.1 BB), so they're almost out. Seat 4 has 200 chips. I'm in 2nd place with 290 chips.

It's not suited, the kicker is terrible, and I have no connectivity. This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI'm at 9.1 BB, which is short-stacked. In tournament play, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call with marginal hands. With A3o from UTG, this is definitely a fold situation.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the opponent actions I gathered:\n- GPT-OSS-120B made a big raise in hand 99 (186 chips) - seems aggressive\n- MiniMax-M2 tends to fold preflop or check postflop - seems passive\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2) is very short with only 36 chips (1.1 BB) - likely to shove soon\n\n**Position:**\nI'm UTG, the worst position. I have to act first postflop, which makes playing marginal hands even worse.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. A3o is too weak to play from UTG with my stack size. I should preserve my 9.1 BB stack for better spots, preferably when I'm in better position or have a stronger hand. With the short stack at seat 2, I might get an opportunity to call their all-in with a better hand soon.\n\nI don't need to search for more information - this is a straightforward fold decision based on basic poker fundamentals.",

I'm extremely short stacked - only 4.5 BB\n2. K9o is a weak hand, easily dominated by AK, KQ, KJ, KT, A9, etc.\n3. I'm facing a raise from GPT-OSS-120B who appears to be in late position\n4.

My M-ratio is extremely low - I need to make a move soon\n\nFrom the opponent history, I can see GPT-OSS-120B has been active with some raises (hand 99: raise 186, hand 100: some postflop betting). They seem to be playing reasonably aggressively.\n\n**Tournament equity consideration:** With 4.5 BB, I'm in critical territory. K9o is not a great hand, but given my stack size and the pot odds, I need to consider if this is a +EV shove spot.\n\nHowever, K9o is dominated by so many hands in their raising range. Even against a wide button raise range, K9o only has about 45-50% equity at best.\n\n**Decision:** This is a fold. K9o is too weak to commit 46% of my stack with, especially out of position. I should wait for a better spot or a better hand to shove with. Preserving my last 156 chips (2.4 BB) gives me a few more hands to find a better situation.\n\n\nI'll fold and wait for a more favorable opportunity to preserve my dwindling tournament life.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the current situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 3d As (Ace-3 offsuit) - decent hand with an Ace but weak kicker\n2. **Position**: BTN (button) - best position\n3. **Stack**: 290 chips (4.5 BB) - very short stacked, in desperate need of chips\n4. **Blinds**: 32/64 - I'm facing a 64 chip call\n5. **Opponents**: Only MiniMax-M2 in BB with 120 chips (1.9 BB) is active\n\nThe pot is 72 chips (8 from SB + 64 from BB). I need to call 64 to win 72, giving me pot odds of about 1.125:1.\n\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's recent history:\n- Hand 93: Folded BB with TT\n- Hand 94: Folded SB with 77 (but this was facing a raise)\n- Hand 95: Checked through with 7s Kh on BTN\n- Hand 96: Called 16 with 6c As from UTG, then checked down\n- Hand 97: Folded with unknown hand\n- Hand 98: Folded\n- Hand 99: Folded facing a big raise\n- Hand 100: Folded from BB\n- Hand 101: Folded from UTG\n- Hand 102: Folded from SB\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems relatively tight/passive, folding often and not showing much aggression.\n\nGiven my situation:\n- I'm extremely short stacked (4.5 BB)\n- I have Ace-high which is likely ahead of random hands\n- I'm on the button\n- The BB is also short stacked and seems tight\n- I need to accumulate chips desperately\n\nThis is a clear shove spot. With only 290 chips and blinds at 64, I have less than 5 big blinds. Ace-3 offsuit is a strong enough hand to go all-in here, especially against a tight opponent who might fold. \n\nIf I call 64, I'll have 226 left (3.5 BB), which still leaves me in desperation mode. \n\nI'll go all-in to maximize fold equity and potentially win the blinds and antes. The aggressive move puts pressure on my opponent, increasing my chances of winning the pot without a showdown. With my extremely short stack, this represents a critical opportunity to rebuild my chip count and stay competitive in the tournament.",

The blinds are 32/64.\n\nLet me analyze my situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A\u26663\u2666 is a weak ace with a suited kicker. From UTG, this is a very marginal hand, especially with a short stack.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. I have to act without any information about what other players will do.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 282 chips, which is only 4.4 BB. This is a very short stack in a tournament situation. With a stack this short, I need to be thinking about survival and finding good spots to get my money in.\n\n4. **Opponents**: Looking at the recent actions:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 88 chips and seems to fold frequently\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 198 chips and has shown aggression (raised 166 in hand 102)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has only 16 chips and is very short\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 4.4 BB, I'm in critical territory. I need to preserve my stack and look for better opportunities. A\u26663\u2666 from UTG is not a good hand to risk my tournament life on.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I have to call 64 chips to win 96, which is 1.5:1 pot odds. But this is misleading because:\n   - I'm out of position\n   - A3 suited plays poorly against calling ranges\n   - If I hit an ace, I'm often dominated by better aces\n   - If I hit my flush draw, I may not have enough chips to realize the equity\n\n7. **Action**: Folding is the clear choice here. I should wait for a better spot - either a better hand or a better position. With such a short stack, I want to be the one shoving, not calling off a significant portion of my stack with a marginal hand from early position.\n\nThe only consideration might be that the players behind me have shown some folding tendencies, but GPT-OSS-120B has also shown aggression. Even if they all fold and I steal the blinds, I'm only adding 96 chips to my 282, which doesn't fundamentally change my situation. And if I get called, I'm in bad shape.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ah Kd - Ace-King offsuit. This is a premium hand, especially in a tournament setting.\n\n2. **My position**: SB (Small Blind) - I'm out of position postflop, which is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **My stack**: 282 chips (4.4 BB) - This is a very short stack, essentially in \"push/fold\" territory. I have less than 5 big blinds.\n\n4. **The situation**: \n   - Blinds are 32/64\n   - Pot is 88 chips (32 from me as SB, 56 from BB)\n   - I have to act first preflop\n   - Amount to call is 0 (I already posted the SB)\n   - Minimum raise is 96 (which is 1.5x the BB)\n\n5. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B with 246 chips (3.8 BB) - Also very short stacked.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data:\n   - Hand 99: Raised to 186 preflop\n   - Hand 100: Checked preflop, then bet 32 on turn\n   - Hand 101: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 102: Raised to 166 preflop\n   - Hand 103: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 104: Checked preflop, bet 198 on flop\n   - Hand 105: Folded preflop\n\n   Pattern: GPT-OSS-120B seems to fold about 50% of hands preflop, but when they do play, they tend to make large raises (166-186) or large postflop bets (198). This suggests they might be playing a \"push/fold\" strategy with their short stack.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With only 4.4 BB, I'm in critical territory. Standard tournament strategy says I should be looking to get all-in preflop with any decent hand. Ace-King is definitely a premium hand worth going all-in with.\n\n8. **Pot odds**: If I shove 282 chips, the pot would be 370 (88 + 282). If opponent folds, I win 88 chips (increase stack by 31%). If they call, I'm risking 282 to win 370.\n\n9. **Decision**: Given my extremely short stack (4.4 BB) and holding Ace-King, this is a clear all-in situation. The opponent also has a short stack (3.8 BB) and has shown willingness to fold preflop about 50% of the time.\n\n\nShoving maximizes fold equity while ensuring I capitalize on my strong hand. The opponent's pattern of folding and making large raises suggests they're likely to fold or potentially call with a wide range, giving me excellent chip-winning opportunities. With such a short stack, this aggressive move represents the most mathematically sound strategy to potentially double up or steal the blinds.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 6s Jc - This is a weak hand, offsuit and low. Not a good starting hand at all.\n\n2. **My position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position, but with such a weak hand it doesn't help much.\n\n3. **My stack**: 258 chips (4.0 BB) - I'm very short-stacked. This is critical tournament situation where I need to find spots to accumulate chips or risk blinding out.\n\n4. **Opponents**:\n   - Seat 4 (SB): MiniMax-M2 with 80 chips (very short)\n   - Seat 5 (BB): GPT-OSS-120B with 182 chips (also short)\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - MiniMax-M2 (SB): Very tight, has folded preflop 6 times in a row, only called once and then folded on flop. Seems very cautious.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (BB): More aggressive, has made some raises and bets. Showed down pocket aces once. Capable of making moves.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Pot is 96, I need to call 64. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, which is not great for a weak hand.\n\n7. **Tournament situation**: With only 4 BB left, I need to make a move soon. However, J6o is one of the worst hands to do it with.\n\n8. **Stack sizes**: If I raise, the minimum is 128 (2x BB). That would leave me with 130 chips. The SB only has 80 chips, so they could potentially call and be pot-committed. The BB has 182 chips.\n\n**Decision**: With J6o, even though I'm extremely short-stacked, this is not a good hand to risk my tournament life on. The SB is very tight and might fold, but the BB has shown aggression. I should preserve my chips for a better spot, preferably when I have a stronger hand or when I'm in a blind vs blind situation. Folding here is the correct play despite being short-stacked.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: SB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: 2s 3c (very weak offsuit, unconnected low cards)\n- Stack: 258 chips (4.0 BB) - short stacked\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 80 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check for free)\n- Only opponent active: GPT-OSS-120B in BB (Seat 5) with 278 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 2s 3c is one of the worst starting hands in poker\n- No suited value, no connected value, low cards\n- Extremely unlikely to win even if we see a flop\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Very tight player - folded preflop in hands 103, 105, 106, 108\n- When they do play (hand 104), they made a large bet on the flop (198 chips)\n- In hand 107, they checked through all streets\n- Generally passive, folds a lot preflop\n\n**Tournament Situation:**\n- I'm down to 4 BB, which is critically short\n- Only 1 opponent (BB) with similar stack\n- This is a shove-or-fold situation\n- I could check to see a free flop, but with 2-3 offsuit, I'm unlikely to hit anything playable\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Give up the 32 chip SB, save 32 chips\n2. **Check**: See free flop with trash hand\n3. **Raise/All-in**: Shove 258 chips with 2-3 offsuit\n\n**Decision:**\nWith 2-3 offsuit, this is a clear fold. Even though I'm short-stacked, I have no fold equity with this hand and I'm almost never ahead. Checking is also an option since it's free, but I'd be playing with trash. \n\nHowever, looking more carefully at the blinds - I posted 32 as SB, but the BB is only 48 (not 64). This seems odd. Let me re-read: \"Blinds: 32/64\" but \"Seat 4 post_bb 48\". This is inconsistent. But the \"Amount to call: 0\" suggests I can check for free.\n\nThe best play here is to fold. Even though it's free to check, playing 2-3 offsuit out of position with a short stack is -EV. I should preserve my 32 chips and wait for a better spot, especially heads-up against a tight opponent where I can shove with any decent hand and have fold equity.\n \nI'm confirming the BB's chip count at 278. With 4 BB, I'm critically short-stacked, which means strategic chip preservation is crucial. Checking might seem tempting, but it risks bleeding more chips with a weak hand. \n\nThe optimal move is a strategic fold. By folding now, I save 32 chips and maintain the ability to make a strong shove later. Waiting for a better hand will maximize my fold equity against the tight opponent, giving me a higher chance of survival in this tournament.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand situation:\n\n1. **My Hand**: 2s 3c - This is a very weak hand, but it has some straight potential on this board (4-5-T). I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 6 to make 2-3-4-5-6).\n\n2. **Position**: SB (Seat 1) - I'm out of position against one opponent (Seat 5).\n\n3. **Stack**: 258 chips (4.0 BB) - This is a very short stack, which means I need to be careful about preserving it but also looking for spots to double up.\n\n4. **Board**: 4d 5c Ts - The flop is relatively coordinated. There are two clubs, so a flush draw is possible. I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 6).\n\n5. **Pot**: 112 chips\n   - Pre-flop: I posted SB 32, BB posted 48, I checked, Seat 5 called 32\n   - So the pot is 32 + 48 + 32 = 112\n\n6. **Opponent**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 246 chips and just called pre-flop from what appears to be the button position (since seats 2, 3, and 4 are out). This suggests they might have a moderately strong hand but not necessarily a premium one.\n\n7. **Action**: It's checked to me, and I can check or raise. The amount to call is 0.\n\nLet me think about my options:\n\n**Option 1: Check**\n- Pros: Free card to try to hit my gutshot, preserve my short stack\n- Cons: Give opponent a free card if they have a strong hand, miss opportunity to take down the pot now\n\n**Option 2: Raise**\n- Pros: Could fold out weak hands, represent strength, take down the pot now\n- Cons: Risk chips with a very weak draw, could face a re-raise and be forced to fold\n\nWith a gutshot straight draw, I have 4 outs (the four 6s in the deck). \n\nI calculate my probability of hitting the straight on the turn. With 4 outs from 47 unknown cards, I have roughly an 8.5% chance of improving my hand. This low probability makes checking the most prudent action. I need to preserve my limited chip stack and avoid unnecessary risks with such a marginal draw.",

It's not a premium hand.\n\n2. **Position**: BTN (Button) - Good position, but that doesn't help much with such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Stack**: 226 chips (3.5 BB) - I'm very short-stacked. This is critical tournament survival territory.\n\n4. **Blinds**: 32/64 - The blinds are very high relative to my stack. I'm in the small blind.\n\n5. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B in BB with 262 chips (4.1 BB) - Also short-stacked.\n\n6. **Pot**: 96 chips\n\n7. **Action**: I need to call 32 more to see the flop.\n\n8. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data:\n   - Hand 104: Had AA and made a big flop bet\n   - Hand 107: Had pocket 7s and played passively (check-check-check-check)\n   - Hand 109: Had 2h3h (suited connector) and called preflop, then made a big flop bet\n   - Recent pattern: More folding than aggressive play (folded in hands 105, 106, 108)\n\nLet me think about the tournament situation:\n- I'm extremely short-stacked at 3.5 BB\n- The blinds are eating me alive\n- I need to make a move soon or I'll be blinded out\n- However, 6c 8s is one of the worst hands in poker\n\nMy options:\n1. **Fold**: Save my 32 chips, but I'll be down to 194 chips (3 BB) and in even worse shape next hand.\n2. **Call**: Pay 32 to see if I can hit something on the flop. But with 6c 8s, I'm unlikely to hit and will often be dominated even if I do hit.\n3. **Raise**: Minimum raise is 128, which is more than half my stack. This would be an all-in or fold situation.\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm extremely short-stacked\n- I have a terrible hand\n- My opponent has shown some tightness (multiple folds)\n- The pot is already 96 chips\n\nI think the best play is to **fold**. Here's why:\n- 6c 8s offsuit is in the bottom 10% of starting hands\n- Even though I'm short, I should wait for a better spot\n- Calling 32 chips (14% of my stack) with this hand is just burning chips\n- If I raise, I'm committing over half my stack with a very weak hand\n- I should preserve my chips for a better opportunity, perhaps when I'm in better position with a stronger hand or can be the first to act aggressively\n\nThe tournament dynamics suggest I need to be patient for one more orbit and look for a better hand to shove with. 6c 8s is simply too weak to risk my tournament life on.",

KJo has decent equity against a wide range, and with my short stack, I need to take spots to double up. Folding would leave me with <1 BB, making this a clear call.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Now I have a clear picture. Looking at the current hand:\n\n**Situation Analysis:**\n- I'm in BB with K\u2665 J\u2663\n- I have 162 chips (2.5 BB)\n- Blinds are 32/64\n- Seat 5 raised to 326, but they only have 32 chips left\n- The amount to call is 262, which means I need to put in 262 more chips\n- But I only have 162 chips total!\n\nWait, let me recalculate. If Seat 5 raised to 326 but only has 32 chips, they must have gone all-in for 32 chips. But the \"amount to call\" shows 262, which is confusing.\n\nLet me think about this differently. The pot is 390 chips. Blinds are 32/64, so:\n- Small blind (Seat 5): 32 chips\n- Big blind (me): 64 chips\n- Total before action: 96 chips\n\nIf Seat 5 raised to 326, that would be a raise of 294 (326-32). But they only have 32 chips total, so this doesn't make sense.\n\nActually, I think the data might be showing that Seat 5 has 32 chips remaining AFTER posting the small blind. So they started with 64 chips (32+32), posted 32 for SB, leaving 32, then went all-in for 32.\n\nSo the raise to 326 might be a display error, or it means the total pot would be 326 if I call.\n\nIf Seat 5 went all-in for their remaining 32 chips:\n- I need to call 32 (not 262)\n- This would make the pot: 64 (my BB) + 32 (their SB) + 32 (their all-in) = 128 chips\n\nBut the display shows \"amount to call: 262\" which would mean I need to call 262 chips to match their bet, but I only have 162 chips.\n\nLet me assume the \"amount to call: 262\" is correct, meaning I need to put in 262 more chips. \n\nI realize the situation is more complex than it first appears. With only 162 chips remaining, I need to carefully consider my options. An all-in move seems inevitable, but the discrepancy between the displayed bet and my actual chip count creates uncertainty. The key is to understand the exact betting requirements and my potential actions within the constraints of my limited chip stack.\n\nI'm facing a critical decision point where my chip count doesn't align with the stated betting amount. This suggests either a data error or a unique tournament scenario that requires immediate clarification. My primary goal is to make a mathematically sound decision that maximizes my potential for chip preservation or growth.\n\nThe key considerations are my hand strength, stack size, and potential opponent actions. With KJo in the big blind and a short stack of 162 chips, I'm likely forced to commit fully. The hand has decent high-card potential, which makes an all-in move strategically viable given my limited options.\n\nI'll need to carefully evaluate whether calling or going all-in provides the best expected value, considering the pot odds and potential opponent reactions. My short stack essentially limits my strategic flexibility to a binary decision: commit completely or fold.\n\nThe most probable scenario is going all-in, leveraging the hand's reasonable strength and my constrained chip position to maximize potential tournament survival.",

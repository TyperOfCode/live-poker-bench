            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand:** Ts 3h (Ten of spades, Three of hearts) - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and with a large gap.\n\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - This is the best position at the table, but...\n\n**Stack:** 131 chips (16.4 BB) - This is a short stack situation. I'm in \"push/fold\" territory, especially with a weak hand.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Blinds are 4/8\n- Pot is 28 chips\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 16\n- Seat 5 folded\n- I need to call 16 to see the flop\n\n**Key considerations:**\n\n1. **Hand strength:** Ts 3h is trash. It's not connected, not suited, low kicker. This hand has very little equity even against random hands.\n\n2. **Position:** While BTN is good, it doesn't make up for having a terrible hand.\n\n3. **Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 raised from MP (middle position) to 2x the BB (16 chips). This is a min-raise. I don't have history on this opponent from the search, but they're in middle position with a healthy stack (255 chips = ~32 BB).\n\n4. **Pot odds:** I need to call 16 to win a pot of 28. That's 16/(28+16) = 16/44 = ~36% pot odds. My hand likely has much less equity than that.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With 16.4 BB, I need to be very selective. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not calling raises with marginal hands. Calling 16 chips would cost me 12% of my stack with a hand that will rarely hit and will be difficult to play post-flop.\n\n6. **Stack preservation:** Calling here would leave me with 115 chips. If I miss the flop (which I will most of the time), I'll have invested 16 chips for nothing. This is a leak that will bleed my stack.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, the stack size is too short to play speculative hands, and calling would commit too much of my stack with poor odds.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the button with Qs 5c, which is a marginal hand. My stack is 143 chips (17.9 BB), which is short but not critically short. The opponent in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 16 total (2x BB raise from 8 to 16). Looking at the opponent's history from seat 4: they've been folding a lot preflop (7 folds out of 10 actions), called once, and bet postflop in a couple of hands. They don't seem overly aggressive preflop.\n\nThe pot is currently 28 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 16). I need to call 8 more chips to continue. That's 5.6% of my stack.\n\nFactors to consider:\n1. Hand strength: Q5o is a weak hand. Offsuit with no connectivity. Queen-high is not great.\n2. Position: I'm on the button, which is good position, but against a single raiser.\n3. Stack sizes: I have 143 chips, opponent has 255 chips. If I call, I'll have 135 left after calling (8 chips).\n4. Tournament considerations: With 17.9 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate. I should be looking for better spots.\n5. Pot odds: I need to call 8 to win 28, which is 3.5:1 odds (22% equity needed). Q5o has about 29% equity against a typical raising range, so mathematically it might be a call.\n6. Implied odds: As the button, I have position advantage, but with such a weak hand, I'll likely have to fold to continuation bets unless I hit something good.\n\nHowever, Q5o is a hand that flops poorly - it needs to hit two pair or better to feel comfortable. The queen-high flop can be dominated easily.\n\nLooking at my own history: I've been folding a lot (38 folds out of 45 hands), which suggests I'm playing tight. I won recently with AA from CO.\n\nGiven my short stack and the weak nature of Q5o, I think folding is correct. I should wait for better spots. The 8 chips to call is small, but it's still 5.6% of my stack, and I'll likely have to fold to most flops. Better to preserve my stack for a better hand.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Actions: SB (seat2) posted 4, BB (seat3) posted 8, seat4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 16 (so raise 8 over BB). So we face 16 to call.\n\nWe need decide fold/call/raise. Hand: T9 unsuited (clubs and diamonds). In cutoff, with 34 BB, facing a raise of 2 BB (16 total). T9o is a marginal hand. Consider opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 has raised previously small amounts (4,4,4,12). So seems to be making small raises, maybe wide range? Could be a standard open raise. He raised to 16 (2BB). That's a standard open raise size. His range could be broad, but still includes many strong hands.\n\nOur hand T9o has some potential for straight draws, but not premium. In a tournament, with 34 BB, we could call to see flop, but also risk being dominated. Position is good (CO). We could also consider 3-betting? But raise to at least 24 (minimum raise). That's 3BB total? Actually raise to 24 means additional 8 over call? Minimum raise is 24 (so raise 8 more). That would be 3BB total (24). That's a small 3-bet, could be used as a bluff or to isolate. But given we have a marginal hand, 3-betting might be risky.\n\nWe could also fold and preserve stack.\n\nWe might want to call if we think we can outplay postflop and have implied odds. Stack depth 34 BB, not deep but enough.\n\nWe should also consider other players: Seats 1 and 2 still to act after us (since we are CO, seat5, next is seat1 (UTG?), seat2 (SB). So if we call, we may face more action.\n\nGiven hand strength, I think best is to fold. T9o is not strong enough to call a raise in cutoff with 34 BB, especially against a player who raises standard size. So fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

While I could theoretically set mine, the combination of being out of position and having a marginal hand makes this a fold.\n\nIf I were in a later position or if there were limpers, I might consider calling. From UTG, I should fold.\n\nLet me make the decision:",

It plays well multi-way but I'm facing a raise from early position (seat 2 appears to be UTG+1 or MP).\n\nOpponent tendencies: From the limited data, seat 2 folded preflop in hand #1.

JTs against a reasonable UTG raising range (say top 15%: 77+, A9s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KQo) has about 38% equity, which is slightly above the break-even point.\n\nHowever, position is terrible. I'll be out of position for the entire hand, which significantly reduces my implied odds and makes the hand harder to play.\n\nTournament considerations: Early in tournament with deep stacks (100 BB).

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: J\u2660 5\u2660 - This is a marginal hand. It's suited but very weak. J5s is not a strong hand, especially from the BB.\n\n**Position**: BB (out of position post-flop)\n\n**Stack**: 197 chips (49.2 BB) - I have a healthy stack.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + MiniMax-M2's raise of 12)\n- I need to call 8 chips to see the flop\n- MiniMax-M2 raised to 12 from what appears to be CO position (Seat 4)\n\n**Opponent analysis**: MiniMax-M2 has been relatively active. Looking at their recent actions:\n- They fold a lot preflop (hands 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26)\n- They do call sometimes (hand 23, 28)\n- When they call/bet, they seem to continue aggression on flop (hands 23, 27, 28)\n- In hand 23, they called a turn bet then bet the river\n- In hand 28, they called preflop, bet flop, called a raise, then folded on turn\n\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 is capable of raising with a somewhat wide range, but they don't seem overly aggressive. The raise size of 3x (12 chips) is standard.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 18, giving me 2.25:1 pot odds. This means I need ~31% equity to call profitably.\n\n**Hand equity**: J5s against a typical CO raising range (maybe 15-20% of hands) has roughly 30-35% equity. So it's borderline.\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. I'm out of position, which makes it harder to realize my equity\n2. J5s can flop some decent draws (flush draws, straight draws)\n3. I have a healthy stack, so calling 8 chips won't hurt me much\n4. However, I'm likely dominated by better Jx hands and my kicker is very weak\n5. The opponent seems competent enough to put pressure post-flop\n\n**Tournament perspective**: With 49 BB, I should be somewhat selective. While I have pot odds, being out of position with a weak hand like J5s is not ideal. I could easily lose more chips post-flop when I hit a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision**: This is a fold. While the pot odds are somewhat attractive, J5s is just too weak to defend from the BB against a raise, especially out of position. The risk of being dominated and losing more chips post-flop outweighs the potential upside. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze the current hand situation. I'm in UTG position with K9 suited (9s Ks). My stack is 163 chips (40.8 BB). The blinds are 2/4, pot is 6 chips. Seat 2 has already folded. I'm first to act after the blinds.\n\nLooking at my hand: K9 suited is not a strong UTG hand. It's speculative at best. In UTG position, I should generally be tight. From my hand history, I've been folding weak hands in UTG (I folded Th6s in UTG in hand #20, and 6s7d in UTG in hand #25).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: I see from the search that opponents have been raising preflop. Kimi-K2 has raised to 12 chips several times (hands #24, #28). GPT-OSS-120B has raised to 30 chips in hand #24. There are aggressive players at the table.\n\nMy position is bad - I'm UTG, so I have to act first and will face action from 4 players behind me. If I call, I'm likely to face raises from later positions.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. But implied odds with K9 suited are not great - it's mainly a drawing hand that needs to hit a flush or straight.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 40.8 BB, which is a decent stack. I should preserve it and look for better spots.\n\nGiven all this analysis:\n1. Hand strength: Weak for UTG (K9s is bottom of UTG opening range)\n2. Position: Terrible (UTG)\n3. Opponent tendencies: Aggressive, likely to raise behind me\n4. Pot odds: Not compelling for a speculative hand\n5. Tournament: Better to preserve stack for stronger spots\n\nThe correct play is to fold. I shouldn't be playing K9s from UTG, especially with aggressive players behind me.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K9s is too weak for UTG opening with aggressive players behind.

Let me check if there's any opponent information I should consider. With pocket aces, I don't need to check opponent tendencies - I should just raise for value regardless.\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips (3x BB) as a standard sizing.

With only 2 opponents left and being on the button, maybe I should raise a bit more to really build the pot. Let me raise to 8 chips (4x BB). This is still reasonable and will extract more value.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes, both opponents have ~170-197 chips, so they have plenty to call with. I should make it 6 chips (3x BB) as a standard, solid raise.\n\nNo, wait - let me think about this more carefully. There are only 2 players left to act. With AA, I want to:\n1. Build the pot\n2. Get called by worse hands\n3. Not scare everyone away\n\nA raise to 6 (3x BB) is standard. But I could also go to 8 (4x BB) to build a bigger pot. Given that it's a tournament and I want to accumulate chips, and I have the absolute nuts, I'll go with 8 to maximize value.\n\nActually, let me reconsider again. The pot is currently 3 chips. A raise to 6 means I'm raising by 4 chips. A raise to 8 means I'm raising by 6 chips.\n\nStandard preflop raise sizing is typically 2.5x-3x the big blind. With 2 opponents, I could do:\n- 5 chips (2.5x BB)\n- 6 chips (3x BB)\n- 7-8 chips (3.5-4x BB)\n\nWith AA, I want to be on the higher side to build the pot.

If I raise to 8, that's a raise of 6 chips total.\n\nGiven it's a tournament with 96 BB effective stacks, and I have the absolute nuts, I should raise to 8 chips (4x BB) to start building a big pot.\n\nNo, wait.

This is a solid size that builds the pot while still being callable by many hands.\n\nHmm, but I should also consider that there are only 2 players left. If I raise too big, I might fold out hands like KQ, AJ, etc. that would call a smaller raise.\n\nLet me compromise and raise to 6 chips (3x BB).

Looking at the opponent's actions: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has folded preflop in 4 of 5 hands, checked once in BB, and made one continuation bet on the flop in hand #4. This is their first preflop raise in the observed hands, suggesting they might have a decent hand.\n\nMy hand is 2h 4d, which is one of the worst possible starting hands in poker. It's unsuited, unconnected, and low cards. Even with the BB discount (I already have 2 chips in), calling 6 more chips with 24o is generally -EV.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 6 to win 11 (current pot). That's about 1.83:1 odds, meaning I need ~35% equity. 24o has nowhere near that against any reasonable raising range.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 86.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to gamble with trash hands. Folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\nThe opponent's raise size is 4x BB, which is a bit larger than standard, possibly indicating strength.\n\nGiven all this, folding is clearly the correct play. Let me check if there are any other factors - maybe the opponent is opening wide from UTG? They're in Seat 1, which appears to be UTG position. A raise from UTG with 24o in the BB is an easy fold.\n\nI should also consider that I'm getting closing action - everyone else has folded, so it's heads-up. But even heads-up, 24o is terrible.\n\nThe only reason to continue would be if I thought I could outplay postflop, but with such a weak hand and position disadvantage (I'll be out of position), it's not worth it.\n\nI'll fold.",

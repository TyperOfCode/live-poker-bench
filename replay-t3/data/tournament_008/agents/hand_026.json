            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand, I have pocket sixes (6d 6h) on the button with 187 chips (46.8 BB). The blinds are 2/4, so this is a relatively deep stack situation.\n\nFrom the opponent actions I can see:\n- In hand 24, the other Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raised to 12 preflop and then called a 3-bet to 30\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) seems aggressive, making big raises and bets\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) folded preflop in hand 24 after the raise\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) also folded\n\nCurrently in this hand:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) posted SB of 2\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) posted BB of 4\n- Seats 4 and 5 folded\n\nSo it's on me (button) to act. I need to call 4 to see the flop.\n\nWith pocket sixes on the button, this is a decent hand. I have:\n- Position advantage (acting last post-flop)\n- Pocket pair that can flop a set (about 12% chance)\n- If I don't hit a set, I can often continuation bet and take it down\n- My stack is healthy at 46.8 BB\n\nI should consider raising here. A standard raise would be 3x the BB = 12 chips. This would:\n- Build the pot when I hit a set\n- Give me initiative post-flop\n- Potentially take down the blinds preflop\n- Charge opponents to see the flop\n\nGiven my position and hand strength, I think raising is the best play. I'll raise to 12 (3x BB).\n\nLet me check my stack if I raise to 12: 187 - 12 = 175 chips left, which is still 43.75 BB - very healthy.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise to: 8. So I could raise to 8, 9, 10, etc. \n\nI'm weighing the pros and cons of different raise sizes. A 12-chip raise feels like the sweet spot - substantial enough to show strength and protect my hand, but not so large that it commits too many chips. The 3x BB raise aligns with standard poker strategy, giving me control of the pot while maintaining flexibility. It sends a clear message of strength without overcommitting my stack.\n\nThe button position gives me additional leverage. I can apply pressure, control the pot size, and potentially take down the hand preflop. With a pocket pair, I'm in a strong position to dictate the action and potentially build the pot if I connect with the board.\n\nMy tournament life isn't immediately threatened, so I can make a calculated move that balances aggression with strategic positioning. The raise feels like the most advantageous play in this scenario.",

Folding to a raise.\"\n}\n```",
            "reasoning_content": "  I have a pair of sixes on a flop of 9c 7d 3h. This is a relatively dry board with no flush draw and only a gutshot straight draw possible (8-6 would make a straight). My opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 has checked to me.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have a pocket pair (66). The board is 9-7-3. I'm currently ahead of any hand that doesn't have a 9, 7, 3, or pocket pair higher than 6. However, I'm vulnerable to many overcards.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is the best position. I have the advantage of acting last.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall data, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been quite tight:\n   - They fold preflop very often (most hands)\n   - When they do call preflop (hands 12, 16, 22), they tend to bet on the flop\n   - In hand 16, they called preflop and bet 8 on flop\n   - In hand 22, they called preflop and bet 5 on flop\n   - They check-called in hand 12 and checked through\n\n   The fact that they checked here suggests they might have missed the flop or have a marginal hand. Their typical pattern is to bet when they have something.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: The pot is 26 chips. If I bet, I need to consider what size.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 175 chips (43.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. I can afford to make a play here.\n\nThe board is relatively dry - no flush draws, only a gutshot straight draw (8-6 or 8-5 would make a straight). This is a good board to continuation bet as the preflop aggressor.\n\nI raised preflop to 12 and got called by the BB. Now they've checked to me. Standard play here would be to make a continuation bet to represent having a strong hand and to protect my equity.\n\nWith a dry board like this, a bet of about 50-70% of the pot would be appropriate. The pot is 26, so a bet of around 13-18 chips makes sense.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that my opponent called a preflop raise. What hands would they call with?\n- Pocket pairs (77, 88, 99, TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA)\n- Suited connectors\n- Broadways\n\nIf they have 77, 99, or 33, I'm crushed. If they have 88, TT+, I'm behind. If they have two overcards, I'm ahead.\n\nGiven that they checked, it's less likely they have a strong hand like a set or top pair. They would likely bet those to protect against draws and get value.\n\nI think a continuation bet is appropriate here to:\n1. Get value from worse hands (overcards)\n2. Protect my hand against overcards\n3. Take down the pot when they have nothing\n\nLet me bet around 60% of pot, so about 15-16 chips. The minimum raise is 8, so I need to raise to at least 8 total, but since there's nothing to call, I need to bet. The minimum raise to 8 means I can put in 8 chips as a bet, but that's too small. I should bet more.\n\nWait, let me re-read the legal actions. It says \"Minimum raise to: 8\". Since there's nothing to call (amount to call is 0), and I can raise, this means I can bet. The minimum bet is 8. So I can bet anywhere from 8 up to my stack.\n\nA bet of 16 (roughly 2/3 pot) seems good. This is enough to put pressure on overcards but not too big that I'm committed if I get raised.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Looking at the opponent's pattern again - they tend to bet on the flop when they have something. The fact that they checked suggests weakness. I could also consider checking behind to pot control and see a free turn card. But with a vulnerable hand like 66, I should probably bet to protect my hand.\n\nI think betting is the right play. Let me go with 16 chips (about 62% of pot).",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: As 6s (ace-six suited)\n- Board: 9c 7d 3h (rainbow, no flush draws)\n- My stack: 167 chips (41.8 BB)\n- Pot: 26 chips\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) with 175 chips\n- Position: I'm in BB, opponent is UTG (Seat 1)\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Preflop: Opponent raised to 12 (3x BB), I called 8 more from BB\n- Now on flop: No bet to call (amount to call is 0), I can check or raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My hand: Ace-high with backdoor flush draw (spades, but board has no spades yet)\n- Board: 9c 7d 3h - dry board, no obvious draws except maybe straight draws (8-T, 5-8)\n- I have overcard (Ace) and backdoor flush/straight possibilities\n- Opponent's range: UTG raise suggests stronger hands: pairs 77+, broadways, suited connectors\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding a lot recently (last 5 hands folded preflop). Only played one hand to showdown (hand 19) where they checked all streets. This suggests they might be playing tight/passive. However, they did raise preflop this hand from UTG, which indicates some strength.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. **Pot Control**: With Ace-high on a dry board, I'm likely behind most of UTG's raising range (pairs 99+, overpairs, maybe AJ+).\n2. **Initiative**: Opponent has preflop initiative, but checked to me on flop? Wait, actually the action says \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning it's my turn to act first on flop? Let me check: Seat 1 raised preflop, I called. On flop, I'm first to act (since I'm BB and called, opponent is UTG who raised). So I act first.\n3. **Stack Sizes**: I have 167 chips, opponent has 175. Pot is 26. Reasonable stack-to-pot ratio.\n4. **Tournament**: Need to preserve chips but also accumulate.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: Allows opponent to take control, but keeps pot small with marginal hand. Good for pot control.\n- **Raise**: Semi-bluff with Ace-high. Could represent a pair or draw. But board is dry, so less credible.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the dry board and my weak hand (ace-high with backdoor draws), checking seems best. I want to see what opponent does. If they bet, I can evaluate pot odds. If they check behind, I get a free turn card.\n\nMy backdoor flush draw needs two more spades, and backdoor straight draws are minimal (5-8 for a straight, but I have A6). Not much equity.\n\nI'll check and see opponent's action. If they bet small, I might call with implied odds for backdoor draws. If they bet big, I can fold.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Ace-high on dry board with backdoor draws.

My hand has very little equity against an UTG raiser's range. Ace-high on a 9-7-3 board is weak, and I'm out of position. The pot odds (27.6%) don't justify calling with likely <20% equity.

            "reasoning_content": "Based on the information I've gathered:\n\n1. **My UTG History**: Looking at my past hands from UTG position, I can see I've been quite selective. Out of 25 total hands, I've only played 7 and folded 18. My UTG hands have included:\n   - 5h-Td (folded)\n   - 3c-Td (folded) \n   - 4h-4s (played and won 35 chips - this was a pocket pair which is much stronger than Q7s)\n   - Th-5h (folded)\n   - 9d-6h (folded)\n\nThis shows I've been very tight from UTG, which is correct strategy. Q7s is much weaker than most of these hands I folded.\n\n2. **Opponent Analysis**: Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been very active - in the last hand (#24), they raised preflop, called a 3-bet, bet on the flop, and then folded on the turn. This suggests they can be aggressive and may have a wider range than typical.\n\n**Decision**: Q7s from UTG is definitely a fold. It's a weak hand with limited potential, and I'm in the worst position with 4 players left to act. Even if I somehow hit a queen or make a straight, I'll be vulnerable to better hands. The history shows I've been correctly folding similar or even slightly better hands from this position.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

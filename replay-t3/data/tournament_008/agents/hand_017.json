            "reasoning_content": "  I have pocket Kings (Kh Kc) in the Cutoff position, which is an extremely strong hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Strength**: Pocket Kings is the second-best starting hand in Hold'em. I should be very aggressive with this hand.\n\n**Position**: I'm in the CO (Cutoff), which is a good position - I'll act after the SB and BB, and I'll have position on the preflop raiser if I call.\n\n**Opponent Info**: GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 raised to 4 (a min-raise). Looking at their history:\n- They've been relatively tight, folding preflop in 4 of the last 6 hands\n- They made a raise in hand 10 (amount 8) and hand 15 (amount 6)\n- They tend to check down when they see flops (hand 9)\n- This suggests they might be raising with a somewhat wide range, but not extremely loose\n\n**Stack Sizes**: \n- I have 181 chips (90.5 BB) - a healthy stack\n- GPT-OSS-120B has 224 chips - also healthy\n- The raise is small relative to stacks (4 chips)\n\n**Pot Odds**: The pot is 7 chips, I need to call 4 chips. That's 7:4 or 1.75:1. With pocket Kings, this is a trivial call.\n\n**Action Decision**: With pocket Kings, I should definitely raise for value. I want to build the pot with my premium hand. A standard 3-bet size would be 3x the original raise, so 12 chips. However, I could also go slightly larger to 14-16 chips to really charge anyone wanting to see a flop.\n\nGiven that:\n1. I have a premium hand (KK)\n2. I'm in good position\n3. The raiser seems to be raising somewhat frequently but not extremely loose\n4. I want to build the pot and get value\n5. I want to potentially isolate against the original raiser\n\nI should make a substantial 3-bet. I'll raise to 14 chips, which is about 3.5x the original raise. This is a good size to get value while still being able to fold if things go terribly wrong postflop (though with KK, I'm rarely folding preflop).",

Amount to call: 13 chips, pot is 21 + 13 = 34 chips? Actually pot calculation: SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 4 + 3-bet 14 + my SB 1 already posted = 22? Wait, let me recalculate:\n   - SB (me): 1 already posted\n   - BB (Seat 4): 2 posted  \n   - Seat 5: raise to 4\n   - Seat 1: raise to 14\n   - Seat 2: folded\n   - Pot = 1 + 2 + 4 + 14 = 21 chips\n   - I need to call 13 more (14 total - my 1 already posted)\n\nFrom the opponent history:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop in hands 6 (8 chips) and 11 (12 chips)\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has raised preflop in hands 10 (8 chips) and 15 (6 chips)\n- Both seem to be active preflop\n\nWith 78o from SB facing a 3-bet, this is a very weak hand. The pot odds: need to call 13 to win 34 (21 current pot + my 13 call), so about 2.6:1 odds or ~28% equity needed.\n\n78o has very little equity against a 3-bet range. Even against a wide 3-bet range like top 15% of hands, 78o has only about 30% equity. But we're out of position, which reduces our playability significantly.\n\nTournament considerations: We have 86.5 BB, which is healthy. No need to gamble with marginal hands out of position.\n\nThe fact that we're in SB means we'll have to act first on every street, making this hand even harder to play.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. We're not getting good enough pot odds, and implied odds are poor since we're out of position.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

I have a weak hand (Q5 offsuit)\n2. I'm facing a 3-bet from a player who has shown some aggression\n3. I have decent stack size but not huge\n4.

Actually raise from 2 to 4 total). Then Kimi-K2 (Seat1) raised to 14 (so a 3-bet). So now we face a 3-bet of 14 total, we have put 4 already, need to call 10 more to match 14. Minimum raise to 24 (i.e., re-raise to 24 total). Our stack is 224, deep. Pocket sevens are a medium pair. In BB vs a 3-bet from UTG? Not sure position: Seat1 is likely UTG? Table seats: Seat1 is early position (maybe UTG). Kimi-K2 Thinking likely a tight-ish player? We have recall: they raised preflop to 8 and 12 in previous hands. Those were 3-bets? Actually they raised to 8 and 12 (maybe from SB?). Not much info. We can consider 3-bet size: 14 is about 7x big blind (big blind 2). That's a fairly standard 3-bet. Pocket sevens are a marginal 3-bet defense. Could call to set mine, but set odds are low: need to hit set on flop (prob ~12%). Pot after call would be 14+10 call+ our 4? Actually pot currently: initial pot 21 (includes blinds and our raise). After K's raise to 14, pot is 21 + (14-4)=31? Wait compute: blinds 1+2 =3, we raised to 4 (adding 2 more). So pot after our raise: 3+2=5? Actually raise to 4 means we put 4 total, so contributed 2 extra over blind, pot = 1+2+2 =5? Not sure. But anyway, call 10 adds to pot. Pot odds: call 10 to win maybe ~? If we call, pot will be about 21+10+? Actually after raise to 14, pot includes 14 from K and 4 from us plus 3 blinds =21? That's what they said pot 21 before actions. After K's raise, pot becomes 21+ (14-4)=31. Call 10 adds to pot making 41. So pot odds ~10/41 ~24%. Set odds ~12% => not profitable. So folding is correct. Could also consider 3-bet re-raise, but pocket sevens are not strong enough to 3-bet. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

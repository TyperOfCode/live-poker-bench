            "reasoning_content": "  The user is asking me to make a decision in a poker hand, but they also want me to use the tools to recall information. However, they gave me an error because I tried to call a tool - they want a JSON response directly.\n\nWait, let me re-read the instructions. The user said \"Invalid response format. Please respond with a JSON object...\" but I was trying to use a tool. Looking at the system prompt again, it says I have access to memory tools to recall information. So I should be able to use them.\n\nBut the user is telling me my response format was invalid. Let me think about this - maybe the flow is that I need to make a decision directly, and the tools are available but I should only use them when necessary? Or perhaps the user interface doesn't actually support calling tools in the middle of a decision?\n\nActually, looking at the conversation again, I tried to call recall_my_hands and the user responded with an error about JSON format. This suggests that maybe I cannot call tools - I need to directly respond with the JSON action.\n\nBut the system prompt clearly says \"You have access to memory tools to recall information about past hands and opponent behavior. Use these tools strategically to inform your decisions.\"\n\nThis is confusing. Let me reconsider. Perhaps the issue is that I need to provide a JSON response with my action, but I can also call tools? That doesn't make sense for a single-turn interaction.\n\nOR - maybe the user message is actually from the system, telling me that my attempt to call a tool was in the wrong format? But I used the correct tool format...\n\nLet me try a different approach. I'll make my decision based on the information I have without using tools, since the user is insisting on JSON format. I have Qh Kh on the button, which is a very strong hand. I'm facing a min-raise situation (need to call 2 more chips).\n\nPosition: BTN (best position)\nHand: KQs (suited Broadway) - very strong\nStack: 195 chips (48.8 BB) - healthy stack\nAction: Everyone folded to me, I posted SB (2), BB is 4, I need to call 2 more to see flop\n\nThis is an easy raise for me. I should raise to build the pot with my strong hand and get value. A standard raise would be 3x the big blind, so 12 chips total. But minimum raise is 8.\n\nLet me raise to 12 (which is 3x BB). This is a standard open-raise size.\n\nActually, wait - I posted SB of 2, BB is 4, so the pot is 6. I need to call 2 more to make it 4 total (matching the BB). A raise to 12 would be standard.\n\nBut let me reconsider the tools issue. The system prompt says I have access to tools. The user message says \"Invalid response format\" when I tried to use one. This might be a test to see if I follow instructions. The most recent instruction is from the user telling me to provide JSON. So I should provide JSON.\n\nActually, I think I understand now. The system is set up so that I need to provide a JSON response with my action. The tools are available, but perhaps I need to make my decision in a single response without calling tools, OR the tool calling should be part of my reasoning but not a separate message.\n\nLet me just make the decision: I have KQs on the button. This is a premium hand in position. I should raise for value. I'll raise to 12 chips (3x BB).",

The flush draw is still possible.\n\nI should consider:\n1. **Value betting**: I likely have the best hand but need to protect against draws\n2. **Pot control**: Check to avoid building a big pot with a vulnerable hand\n3. **Opponent's range**: They called preflop and flop - could have Kx, clubs, straight draws, or middle pairs\n\nGiven the coordinated board and potential draws, I think a value bet is appropriate to charge draws and get value from worse hands. I need to size it appropriately.\n\nA bet of around 1/2 to 2/3 pot (28-37 chips) would be good for value and protection. The minimum raise is 16, but that's too small - it gives draws good odds.\n\nLet me bet 32 chips (about 57% of pot) to charge draws while still getting called by worse hands.",

The opponent has called all my bets so far, which suggests they have something decent. However, they're also very tight and fold often.\n\nThe board is somewhat coordinated with straight and flush possibilities. The Ts on the river could complete some hands.\n\nGiven:\n1. I have top pair, good kicker\n2. I've been betting aggressively representing strength\n3. Opponent has called twice but is generally tight\n4. Pot is already 120 and I have 137 left\n5. No bet to call, so I can check for showdown\n\nI should check here because:\n- There's no value in betting - worse hands will fold\n- If I bet and get raised, I'll be in a tough spot\n- Checking allows me to see a cheap showdown with my strong hand\n- I've already shown enough strength with my flop and turn bets\n\nI don't think I should fold or raise.

My opponent check-called preflop, then bet flop, bet turn, and checked river\n2. This betting pattern suggests they likely have something but are not confident about it\n3. The ten on the river completes some straight draws (98 would have the nuts)\n4. I'm risking my entire tournament on this decision\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- Two pair is strong here, but there are several hands that beat me:\n  - Any straight (98, T8, 87, etc.)\n  - Any set (KK, 99, TT, 66, 77)\n  - Two pair with a better kicker (AK, KQ, KJ)\n\nGiven that my opponent checked the river after aggressive betting on earlier streets, this often indicates either:\n1. They're giving up on a bluff\n2. They have a medium-strength hand they're unsure about\n\nWith only 73 chips left and a 120 chip pot, I need to be very careful.

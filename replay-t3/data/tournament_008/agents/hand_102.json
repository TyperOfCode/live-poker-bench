I'm extremely short stacked - only 4.5 BB\n2. K9o is a weak hand, easily dominated by AK, KQ, KJ, KT, A9, etc.\n3. I'm facing a raise from GPT-OSS-120B who appears to be in late position\n4. Pot odds: 134 to win 262 = ~2:1 odds\n5. My M-ratio is extremely low - I need to make a move soon\n\nFrom the opponent history, I can see GPT-OSS-120B has been active with some raises (hand 99: raise 186, hand 100: some postflop betting). They seem to be playing reasonably aggressively.\n\n**Tournament equity consideration:** With 4.5 BB, I'm in critical territory. K9o is not a great hand, but given my stack size and the pot odds, I need to consider if this is a +EV shove spot.\n\nHowever, K9o is dominated by so many hands in their raising range. Even against a wide button raise range, K9o only has about 45-50% equity at best.\n\n**Decision:** This is a fold. K9o is too weak to commit 46% of my stack with, especially out of position. I should wait for a better spot or a better hand to shove with. Preserving my last 156 chips (2.4 BB) gives me a few more hands to find a better situation.\n\n\nI'll fold and wait for a more favorable opportunity to preserve my dwindling tournament life.",

            "reasoning_content": "We need decide action with Qd5d on button, short stack 2.6 BB (166 chips). Blinds: SB 32, BB 64, pot 96. Effective stacks: we have 166, others have 290, 8 (tiny), 0, 184. We are short stacked, need to find best move: either shove all-in (raise to 166) or call 64 or fold. Hand Q5 suited is weak, not a good shoving hand. But we could call and hope to see flop? With 2.6 BB, calling 64 leaves 102 left, still short. Better to shove all-in to maximize fold equity? But Q5 suited is not a good all-in; may get called by better hands, lose. However, with such short stack, you may need to pick a hand to go all-in. Typically you push with any Ace, broadway, suited connectors, etc. Q5 is borderline. Might consider folding.\n\nWe can also check opponent tendencies: seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat 2 is Kimi-K2 with 8 chips (short). Seat 2 is already all-in? Actually seat 2 posted BB 64, not all-in. So if we call 64, we will be left with 102 chips. Could we later be forced to push later? Might be okay.\n\nGiven hand strength: Q5 suited has some potential to hit flush or straight, but low equity vs typical ranges. In button vs SB and BB, we could attempt to steal by raising. Minimum raise is 128 total, which would be raise to 128 (i.e., add 64 more). That would be a raise of 64 more, total put in 128. Our stack 166, so raise to 128 leaves 38 behind. That's a small raise, not all-in. Could also raise all-in to 166.\n\nBut legal actions include raise. We could raise to 166 (all-in) to apply pressure; SB may fold, BB may call with a wide range? BB has 64 already, so they'd have to call 102 more. They might call with many hands given they are short? Actually BB has 64 blind, but stack 64? Wait seat 2 is BB with 64 chips, that's his entire stack. So BB is effectively all-in already (post blind). So if we raise, we are raising against a blind that is already all-in? Actually the BB's 64 is his stack, so he's all-in. So raising would be a re-raise (i.e., we would be raising over the BB's all-in, which is not allowed because you can't raise over an all-in? In poker, you can only call the all-in or fold. So legal actions should be fold, call, raise? But raise is not possible because opponent is all-in? However system says raise is legal. Possibly they treat BB as just a blind, not all-in. Actually stack 64 equals blind amount, but he could have more chips? No stack is 8 chips for seat 2? Wait seat 2 is Kimi-K2 - 8 chips. Oh sorry, seat 2 has 8 chips total, posted BB 64? That can't be; maybe seat 2 is the BB with 8 chips left after posting? Actually they posted BB 64, but stack says 8 chips; contradictory. Might be that seat 2's stack is 8 chips after posting? So they are effectively all-in for 8? Not sure.\n\nGiven confusion, we treat as normal: we can call 64 to match BB, then SB may act later.\n\nGiven short stack, best is to go all-in with any hand that has some equity. Q5 suited is not great but could be okay. However folding preserves chips for better spot. Since we have 2.6 BB, we are in danger of being blinded out. If we fold, we lose 0 chips but will be forced to post blinds later and likely be eliminated. Might be better to shove.\n\nI think we should raise all-in (to 166) as a shove.\n\nReasoning: short stack, button, want to steal blinds, Q5 suited has some flush potential, and we can apply pressure. So raise to 166.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

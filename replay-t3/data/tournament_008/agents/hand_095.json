            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My Situation:**\n- Cards: 9h 5d (unsuited, very weak)\n- Position: BTN (good position)\n- Stack: 274 chips (8.6 BB) - short stacked\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- Amount to call: 32 chips\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - only 28 chips left (0.875 BB), very short stacked\n- Seat 4 (BB): MiniMax-M2 - 160 chips (5 BB), also short stacked\n\n**Opponent Tendencies from Memory:**\n- Kimi-K2 (SB): Very tight player, mostly folding preflop. Only raised once (133 chips) and called once (89 chips) in recent hands. At showdown, had Kd9h and Kd6h - playing weak Kings. Now extremely short stacked with 28 chips.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): Extremely tight, folding almost every hand preflop. Only showed down strong hands like AJ, JT, and pocket 8s.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 9h 5d is a terrible hand, unsuited and disconnected. One of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n2. **Stack size**: I'm short stacked at 8.6 BB, but not desperate yet. I should be selective with my shoves.\n\n3. **Opponent situation**: \n   - SB has only 28 chips and is very tight. They might shove or fold.\n   - BB is extremely tight and has 5 BB. They'll likely only call with premium hands.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 to win 48 (1.5:1), which is 40% equity needed. Even against two random hands, 95o has only about 30% equity.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 8.6 BB, I need to be careful but I'm not in push/fold mode yet. I should wait for a better spot.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. My hand is terrible, I'm not desperate enough to gamble with 95o, and both opponents are short-stacked and likely to shove if I just call. I should preserve my chips for a better opportunity.",

With three hearts showing and the Ace on board, I have minimal equity. Kimi-K2's consistent checking pattern suggests they either have a weak hand or are being cautious with their short stack.\n\nGiven that:\n1. My hand has very little showdown value\n2. The board has potential flush draws that could beat me\n3. I can see the river for free\n4. My stack (5 BBs) needs protection\n\nThe optimal play is to check and hope to improve on the river, while avoiding putting more chips at risk with such a weak hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"My K7 offsuit is very weak against this board with three hearts. Kimi-K2 has been passive throughout and is short-stacked. Since there's no bet to call, checking is optimal to see the river for free and avoid risking more chips with minimal equity.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this turn situation carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: BB (Seat 4) with 7s Kh\n- Stack: 160 chips (5.0 BB)\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- Board: Ah Th 4h 6h (flush draw possible with hearts)\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) with 12 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (opponent checked)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have K7 offsuit, which is a very weak hand. The board has an Ace of hearts and three hearts total (Ah, Th, 6h), so there are flush possibilities. I have no pair, no straight, and very little equity.\n\n2. **Opponent Analysis**: Kimi-K2 has only 12 chips left (less than half the big blind of 32). This means they're essentially short-stacked and may be looking for opportunities to go all-in or make desperate moves.\n\n3. **Board Texture**: The board is Ah Th 4h 6h. There are three hearts, so flush draws are possible. Kimi-K2 has been checking through the hand so far (preflop call, then check-check-check on flop and turn). This suggests either:\n   - They have a weak hand themselves\n   - They're slow-playing a strong hand\n   - They're being cautious with their short stack\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: Since the amount to call is 0, I can check for free to see the river, or I could raise to try to win the pot immediately.\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: With 5 BBs, I'm in a vulnerable position. I need to be careful about protecting my stack while also looking for opportunities to accumulate chips.\n\n**Decision Making:**\n- My hand (K7o) is very weak\n- The board has potential flush draws that could beat me\n- Kimi-K2 is short-stacked and has been passive so far\n\n\n- A check seems the most prudent move, allowing me to navigate the river without unnecessary risk\n- Raising would expose my weak hand to potential strong opponent responses\n- Free card gives me a chance to improve without additional investment\n",

To call is 32, which would be 1 BB more (total 64 in pot). Our stack is 250, we could go all-in (250) but that's a lot.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should consider shove? But 5hJs is not a good hand for shove UTG. Better to fold and preserve chips, maybe try to find better spot later. Since we are short, but still have 7.8 BB, can we consider a steal? Usually you need strong hands. So fold.\n\nWe need to output JSON.",

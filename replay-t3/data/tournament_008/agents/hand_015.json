            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 6c Kh (King-high, suited connector but very weak - King with a 6 kicker)\n- Position: SB (worst position post-flop)\n- Stack: 181 chips (90.5 BB)\n- Pot: 9 chips\n- Facing a raise to 6 from GPT-OSS-120B in seat 5 (button/late position)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent preflop actions:\n- Hand 8: fold\n- Hand 9: call 1 (limp)\n- Hand 10: raise 8\n- Hands 11-14: fold, fold, fold, fold\n\nSo they've been relatively tight recently, with only 1 raise in the last 5 hands where they entered. The raise to 6 seems significant.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nK6 offsuit is a very marginal hand. It's dominated by any other King (KA, KQ, KJ, KT, K9, K8, K7). The 6 kicker is terrible. This is generally a fold in most situations.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in the SB, which is the worst position. If I call, I'll be out of position for the entire hand.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nI need to call 5 to win 9, so getting less than 2:1. This is not great odds for a marginal hand.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack (90.5 BB), no need to take marginal spots. Better to preserve chips for better opportunities.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. K6 offsuit from SB facing a raise is a standard fold. The opponent's raise suggests strength, and I'd be out of position with a very weak hand that has poor equity against their range.",

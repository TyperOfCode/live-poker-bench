This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position at the table, which gives me some advantage postflop. However, the hand is just too weak to play.\n\n**Stack**: 141 chips (35.2 BB) - This is a healthy stack size, not desperate.\n\n**Pot**: 6 chips (blinds)\n\n**Players left to act**: Only the blinds after me (Seat 2 and Seat 3)\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from the data:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 in SB): Folded preflop in hand 34\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB): Folded preflop in hand 34 and hand 35, bet on turn in hand 33\n- Generally, opponents seem to be playing somewhat tight\n\n**Hand History Analysis**:\n- I've been folding a lot (28 folds out of 35 hands) - about 80% fold rate\n- I've only won 6 out of 35 hands\n- My recent hands were mostly folds with weak holdings\n\n**Decision**: With 9-3 offsuit, even on the button, this is a clear fold. The hand has:\n- No high card value\n- No suitedness\n- No connectivity (gap of 5 ranks)\n- Very low chance of making a strong hand postflop\n\nWhile I could theoretically try to steal the blinds with a raise, this is not a good spot:\n1. My hand is too weak to play postflop if called\n2. I don't have enough information that the blinds are extremely tight\n3. The risk/reward isn't worth it with this hand strength\n4. I should preserve my chips for better spots\n\nThe correct play is to fold.",

Hand strength: J5o is a very weak hand. It's dominated by many hands that would raise from SB.\n2. Position: We're out of position (BB vs SB) - this is a disadvantage postflop.\n3. Pot odds: Need to call 8 to win 24 (current pot 16 + our 8 call). That's 1:3 odds (25% equity needed).\n4. Implied odds: Poor with J5o - we're unlikely to hit a strong hand that can win a big pot.\n5. Stack preservation: We have 41.2 BB, which is healthy. No need to defend with trash.\n\n**Decision:** This is an easy fold. J5o has terrible equity against a SB raising range. Even if opponent is stealing, we need a better hand to defend. The 8 chips to call represent 4.8% of our stack, not worth it with this hand.\n\nWe should wait for better spots.",

I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"3h 8h is too weak to play from UTG position.

Let me break down what I know:\n\n1. **My Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - this is the earliest position after the blinds, so I need to be very cautious with weak hands\n2. **My Hand**: 3h 8h - this is a very weak hand, suited connectors but very low ones. These are suited connectors but with very low ranks, giving me very little equity\n3. **My Stack**: 215 chips (53.8 BB) - I'm in good shape, not short stacked\n4. **Situation**: I'm facing a call of 4 chips to stay in the hand, minimum raise would be to 8 chips\n5. **Blinds**: 2/4, so it's a 4-chip raise to enter the pot\n\nKey considerations:\n- UTG position is the worst position in poker - I act first preflop\n- 3h 8h is a very weak hand, especially UTG\n- I have decent stack size but don't want to waste chips\n- In early position with weak hands, I should generally fold\n\nThe hand 3h 8h has very little equity, especially from UTG. Even if I call, I'm likely dominated by higher suited connectors or made hands. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify calling with such a weak hand from this position.\n\nI should fold this hand. It's too weak to play from UTG position, especially when there are multiple players left to act who could have much stronger hands.\n\nLet me check if I want to use any memory tools to recall past hands or opponent tendencies. Actually, since this is just the preflop decision and I have a clear fold with this weak hand from UTG, I don't think I need to use the tools. The decision is straightforward.\n",

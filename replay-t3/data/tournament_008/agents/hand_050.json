With 14.9 BB, I need to accumulate chips. A min-raise to 16 is a good steal attempt that risks minimal chips while leveraging my position and opponent's tightness. Even if called, I have some playability post-flop in position.\"\n}\n```",
            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand**: Q9 offsuit - This is a marginal hand. Q9o is not a premium hand but has some potential, especially in position.\n\n**My position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position post-flop. I get to act last on every street.\n\n**My stack**: 119 chips (14.9 BB) - I'm short-stacked. With less than 15 big blinds, I need to be looking for spots to either shove or fold. I don't have room to play speculative hands.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Everyone folded to me on the button\n- I need to call 4 chips to see the flop (pot is 12, I posted 4 as SB)\n- The BB (Kimi-K2) is the only player left\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Looking at Kimi-K2's recent actions:\n- They folded preflop in hands 38-40, 42-49 (very tight)\n- In hand 36-37 they were raising preflop (older hands)\n- In hand 41 they called preflop, then bet on turn and river\n\nThis suggests Kimi-K2 has been playing very tight recently, folding 9 out of the last 10 hands preflop.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 14.9 BB, I should generally be playing a push/fold strategy. Q9o is a borderline hand for a button shove with this stack size. Against a tight BB who folds a lot, I could consider stealing.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 4 to win 12 (3:1 odds). If I raise, minimum is 16 (which is a significant portion of my stack).\n\n**Decision**: \n- Folding is safe but maybe too tight given my position and opponent's tightness\n- Calling is not ideal with a short stack and marginal hand - I'd be playing post-flop out of position with a weak hand\n- Raising to 16 (minimum) commits about 13% of my stack. Given that the BB has been folding 90% of the time, a steal attempt could be profitable\n\nGiven that Kimi-K2 has folded 9/10 recent hands preflop, and I'm on the button with a short stack where I need to accumulate chips, I think a raise (steal attempt) is the best play. The minimum raise to 16 seems appropriate - it's enough to put pressure without risking my whole stack.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 14.9 BB, a min-raise to 16 leaves me with 103 behind. If I get called or raised, I'm in a tough spot with Q9o. \n\nThe more standard play with this stack size would be either:\n1. Fold - preserve my stack for a better spot\n2. Shove all-in - maximize fold equity\n\nGiven the opponent's extreme tightness (folding 90% of hands), a shove might actually get through often enough to be profitable. Q9o is a decent hand for a button shove against a tight player.\n\nLet me think about the math: If they fold 90% of the time, I win 12 chips. 10% of the time they call (likely with a strong range), and I'll have about 30-40% equity. The EV might be positive.\n\nBut actually, looking at standard push/fold charts, Q9o from the button at 15 BB is typically a fold against a standard opponent. However, against someone folding 90% of hands, it becomes a clear shove.\n\nI'll go with a raise (steal attempt) rather than an all-in shove. The minimum raise to 16 risks fewer chips and should still accomplish the goal of stealing the blinds given how tight the BB has been playing.",

However, in hand #37, they called flop and turn bets before folding on the river, showing they can go to showdown with marginal hands. They also made bets on turn and river in hand #41.\n\nThe fact that they called my preflop raise from the BB suggests they have something - could be a pocket pair, a Qx hand, or maybe a suited connector/hearts.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** I have top pair with a decent kicker. The board is relatively dry except for the two hearts. I should be ahead of most of their range here.\n2. **Position:** I'm in position (BTN) which is good.\n3. **Stack size:** I have 13.4 BB, which is short but not desperate yet.\n4. **Pot size:** Pot is 32, which is about 30% of my stack.\n5. **Opponent:** They called preflop from BB, could have a wide range but likely has some equity.\n\n**Decision:** This is a good spot to bet for value and protection. I want to:\n- Get value from weaker hands (like 5x, 33, small pairs, flush draws)\n- Protect against flush draws\n- Build the pot since I likely have the best hand\n\nI should make a solid value bet. The pot is 32, so a bet of around 16-24 chips (50-75% pot) seems appropriate. This will charge flush draws and get value from weaker pairs.\n\nLet me make it 24 chips (75% pot) to charge draws and get value.",

The fact they raised preflop from SB after folding so many hands suggests they have something like AQ, KQ, QJ, or a strong ace. \n\nMy bottom pair is unlikely to be good here, and even if I hit my 3 on the turn, I could be walking into a bigger hand.

I need to call 8 chips or raise to at least 16 total.\n\nFrom opponent history:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): No data, but based on name might be more aggressive/thinking\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has been folding a lot recently (7 straight folds after hand 41)\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has raised twice preflop (hands 46 and 48) and called once\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Raised once preflop (hand 45), otherwise mostly folding\n\nMy own history shows I've been folding a lot (41 folds in 49 hands), but just won hand 49 with AQ from CO.\n\nAJo from UTG is a marginal hand. In tournament poker with 18.9 BB, this is a tricky spot. Standard play with this stack depth is either:\n1. Fold (tight play, preserve stack)\n2. Raise (standard 2.5x-3x)\n3. Shove (all-in with 18.9 BB)\n\nGiven my position (UTG) and the fact there are 4 players left to act, raising is risky. If I raise to say 24 (3x), that's 16% of my stack, and I'll be out of position against any callers. \n\nThe alternative is to go all-in, which puts pressure on everyone. With 18.9 BB, a shove from UTG with AJo could be reasonable, though it's somewhat loose. \n\nGiven the opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot, MiniMax-M2 has shown aggression but not excessive, GPT-OSS-120B mostly folds. They might all fold to a shove, which would win the 12 chip pot.\n\nBut I should consider ICM implications in a tournament. With 18.9 BB, I'm not in dire straits yet. I could fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nHowever, AJo has decent equity against random hands. Let me think about the math:\n- If I shove 151 into 12, I need folds about 88% of the time (151/(151+12) \u2248 92.6% actually)\n- But the blinds will call with some range\n- With 4 players left to act, the chance all fold is lower\n\nActually, let me calculate: If each player calls with top 10% of hands, chance all fold = 0.9^4 = 65.6%. That's not enough.\n\nBetter to raise standard or fold. Given tournament considerations and position, I think folding is correct. AJo from UTG with 18.9 BB is borderline, but folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\nWait, I could also just call 8 chips. That's only 5.3% of my stack. But then I'm playing AJo out of position multiway, which is terrible.\n\nActually, looking at my recent win with AQ from CO - that was a raise to 24 (3x). AJo is weaker than AQ.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. Preserve stack, wait for better position or stronger hand."

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this preflop situation. I'm in UTG (early position) with AJo offsuit. Stack is 151 chips (18.9 BB). Blinds are 4/8. The pot is 12 chips (SB + BB). I need to call 8 chips or raise to at least 16 total.\n\nFrom opponent history:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): No data, but based on name might be more aggressive/thinking\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has been folding a lot recently (7 straight folds after hand 41)\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has raised twice preflop (hands 46 and 48) and called once\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Raised once preflop (hand 45), otherwise mostly folding\n\nMy own history shows I've been folding a lot (41 folds in 49 hands), but just won hand 49 with AQ from CO.\n\nAJo from UTG is a marginal hand. In tournament poker with 18.9 BB, this is a tricky spot. Standard play with this stack depth is either:\n1. Fold (tight play, preserve stack)\n2. Raise (standard 2.5x-3x)\n3. Shove (all-in with 18.9 BB)\n\nGiven my position (UTG) and the fact there are 4 players left to act, raising is risky. If I raise to say 24 (3x), that's 16% of my stack, and I'll be out of position against any callers. \n\nThe alternative is to go all-in, which puts pressure on everyone. With 18.9 BB, a shove from UTG with AJo could be reasonable, though it's somewhat loose. \n\nGiven the opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot, MiniMax-M2 has shown aggression but not excessive, GPT-OSS-120B mostly folds. They might all fold to a shove, which would win the 12 chip pot.\n\nBut I should consider ICM implications in a tournament. With 18.9 BB, I'm not in dire straits yet. I could fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nHowever, AJo has decent equity against random hands. Let me think about the math:\n- If I shove 151 into 12, I need folds about 88% of the time (151/(151+12) \u2248 92.6% actually)\n- But the blinds will call with some range\n- With 4 players left to act, the chance all fold is lower\n\nActually, let me calculate: If each player calls with top 10% of hands, chance all fold = 0.9^4 = 65.6%. That's not enough.\n\nBetter to raise standard or fold. Given tournament considerations and position, I think folding is correct. AJo from UTG with 18.9 BB is borderline, but folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\nWait, I could also just call 8 chips. That's only 5.3% of my stack. But then I'm playing AJo out of position multiway, which is terrible.\n\nActually, looking at my recent win with AQ from CO - that was a raise to 24 (3x). AJo is weaker than AQ.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. Preserve stack, wait for better position or stronger hand.",

            "reasoning_content": "The user is reminding me about the required response format. I need to output JSON with action, raise_to, and reasoning. I was analyzing the hand and concluded fold is best. Let me structure that properly.\n\nI'm UTG with AJo, 18.9 BB stack. Blinds 4/8. Pot 12. Need to call 8. Options: fold, call, raise to at least 16. \n\nMy analysis: AJo from UTG is marginal. With 18.9 BB, not desperate. Tournament considerations favor preserving stack. Calling 8 chips (5.3% of stack) to play AJo out of position multiway is bad. Raising commits too much of stack or risks getting called/raised by later positions. \n\nOpponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 folds a lot, MiniMax-M2 somewhat aggressive, GPT-OSS-120B mostly folds. But still, raising from UTG with AJo is loose.\n\nBest play: fold. Wait for better spot.\n\nSo response should be: {\"action\": \"fold\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"AJo from UTG with 18.9 BB is marginal. Folding preserves stack for better spots. Playing AJo out of position multiway is unfavorable. Tournament considerations prioritize stack preservation over marginal hands.\"}\n\nI should make the reasoning concise. Let me output that.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 2d 6h - This is an extremely weak hand, especially UTG (first to act). This is essentially a garbage hand that has very little equity against any reasonable range.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position to have a weak hand, as I'm first to act and will face action from all players behind me.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 295 chips (36.9 BB) - I'm in decent shape stack-wise, not short-stacked but not deep either.\n\n4. **Opponent analysis**:\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Looking at the memory, they've been folding a lot preflop (9 consecutive folds). They seem tight/passive.\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Also been folding a lot preflop, but showed some aggression in hand 41 with betting on turn and river. However, mostly folding.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to see the flop, with a pot of 12 chips. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, which isn't terrible, but with 2d 6h, I'm likely dominated by almost any hand that calls or raises.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: I'm at 36.9 BB, which is a healthy stack. I should be selective with hands, especially from UTG position.\n\n7. **My UTG history**: Looking at my past UTG hands, I've folded most of them (4 out of 5 shown), and when I did play (Ah Qh), I raised and won. This reinforces that I should be very selective UTG.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. 2d 6h UTG is one of the worst possible hands in poker. Even with decent pot odds, the likelihood of being dominated or making a weak pair that loses to better kickers is very high. Both opponents behind me appear to be relatively tight, which means if they call or raise, they likely have better hands.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

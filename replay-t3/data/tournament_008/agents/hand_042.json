Everyone else has folded.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 is in the big blind and has shown some aggression preflop with raises in previous hands (4 raises in 4 observed actions). However, this is a situation where they've already posted the BB and I'm completing from SB to BB. They might check or might raise.\n\nMy hand 2c4d is terrible - no connectivity, no suitedness, low cards. Even from the button, this is a fold. The only reason to consider calling is the small price (4 chips to win 12, getting 3:1 odds). However, with such a weak hand and deep stack implications (I have 139 chips, 17.4 BB), it's better to fold and preserve my stack.\n\nFrom my hand history, I've been folding a lot (35 folds in 41 hands), which suggests I'm playing tight. This fits with a tournament strategy where preserving chips is important.\n\nGiven the terrible hand strength and position advantage (button) being minimal with such a weak hand, I should fold. The potential to outplay postflop is limited with 24o.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

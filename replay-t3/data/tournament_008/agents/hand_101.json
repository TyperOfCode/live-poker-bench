So we are actually SB? Position says BB but actually we posted small blind. So we are SB with 32 posted. Big blind is seat1 with 64. So we are SB with 2.6 BB effective. To call we need to match big blind 64, but we have already posted 32, so amount to call 32. Min raise to 128 total (i.e., raise 96 more). Stack 166, so can raise to 128 (puts total 128, i.e., additional 96). That leaves us with 38 chips left after raise.\n\nHand Kh5d is weak. With such short stack, options: fold, call, or possibly shove all-in? Raise to 128 still leaves 38 chips, still short. Could also go all-in for 166 (or 166? need to put total 166). But min raise is 128, we could raise to 166 (all-in) as raise_to 166. Is that advisable? Hand is weak, not a candidate for shove. Call 32 to see flop? With 2.6 BB, calling is okay if we think we can see flop cheap. But hand is weak, likely fold. However short stack, folding preserves 166 chips (still 2.6 BB). If we call, we'll be at 96 effective stack vs opponent 226? Actually opponent big blind seat1 has 226 chips, will see flop. Might have advantage. Our hand low equity.\n\nBetter to fold.\n\nCheck legal actions: fold, call, raise. So choose fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

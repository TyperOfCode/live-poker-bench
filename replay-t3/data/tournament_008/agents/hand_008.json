            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have 6h Td on the Button (BTN)\n- My stack: 172 chips (86 BB)\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raised to 6 (3x BB)\n- Amount to call: 6\n- Pot is currently 9 (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise)\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button, which is excellent position. However, my hand is very weak - T6 offsuit is a bottom-tier hand.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:** From the recall, Kimi-K2 has raised preflop to 6 chips in both previous hands where they raised (hands 2 and 7). This suggests a consistent 3x BB opening size. I don't have showdown information about what hands they showed down with.\n\n**My History:** I've folded 6 out of 7 hands, winning only 1 hand. My stack is 172 chips, which is below average but not critical.\n\n**Pot Odds:** To call 6 into a pot of 15 (9 current + 6 if I call), I'm getting 2.5:1 pot odds. However, there are still players behind me who could act: MiniMax-M2 (SB) and GPT-OSS-120B (BB). They could call or raise.\n\n**Hand Strength:** T6o is a terrible hand. It has poor high-card value, no connectivity, and is offsuit. Even with position, this hand plays poorly postflop. It's only good for bluff catching or hitting two pair+.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** With 86 BB, I have plenty of chips. No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands.\n\n**Alternatives:** I could consider 3-betting as a bluff given my position, but T6o is too weak even for that. Folding is clearly correct.\n\nThe button position is tempting, but the hand is just too weak to play, especially facing a raise. Even if I call, I'll be out of position against the raiser postflop unless everyone folds, which is unlikely given the blinds still to act.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. Wait for a better spot.",

It's suited connectors but very low, giving me almost no equity against any reasonable range.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the small blind, which is the worst position in poker. When I call, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\n3. **Opponent Analysis**: Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been raising preflop frequently - I can see they've raised 6 chips in multiple hands (hands #2 and #7). This suggests they have a relatively wide raising range or are being aggressive.\n\n4. **Pot Odds**: The amount to call is 5 chips into a 9-chip pot (after my small blind). This gives me pot odds of about 1.8:1, but with 2c 4h, I have very poor equity against any reasonable range.\n\n5. **Stack Considerations**: I have 203 chips (101.5 BB), which is a healthy stack. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\n6. **Tournament Strategy**: With such a weak hand, the risk of being dominated is very high. Even if I hit a straight or flush, I'd be vulnerable to higher straights or flushes.\n\n7. **My Recent History**: Looking at my last 5 hands, I've been folding quite frequently (6 out of 7 hands), and when I do play, I tend to be selective. My only win was with pocket 6s.\n\nThe decision is clear: I should fold this extremely weak hand. Even though the pot odds seem attractive, 2c 4h has very poor playability and I'm out of position. I should wait for a much better hand before getting involved, especially against an opponent who seems to be raising frequently.",

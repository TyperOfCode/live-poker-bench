Better to preserve chips for a stronger hand or better position.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have Td 9h - a suited connector but not suited (different suits). This is a marginal hand, especially from early position (UTG).\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in UTG (Under the Gun), which is the worst position preflop. I have 5 players still to act behind me.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 274 chips = 8.6 BB. This is a short stack in tournament terms. With a stack this short, I need to be very selective about which hands I play.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the recall, I can see:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been folding a lot preflop\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been active, making raises and calls\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) is very short stacked with only 12 chips\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 32 chips to win a pot of 48 chips, which is 1.5:1 odds. This would require me to win ~40% of the time to break even.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With only 8.6 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. Playing marginal hands like T9o from early position is generally a losing play. I should be looking for spots to either shove with strong hands or fold and wait for better opportunities.\n\n7. **Action**: The blinds are 16/32, so calling 32 chips would cost me about 12% of my stack. If I call and miss the flop (which will happen most of the time), I'll be in a difficult spot with an even shorter stack.\n\n8. **Alternative**: Folding preserves my stack and allows me to wait for a better hand or position.\n\nGiven all these factors, especially my short stack size, poor position, and marginal hand strength, the correct play is to fold. T9o from UTG with 8.6 BB is simply not strong enough to justify the investment.",

The board shows:\n- 3s (spade)\n- 7d (diamond) \n- Ks (spade)\n\nKey observations:\n1. I have Ace high, which is decent\n2. I have a flush draw with the 6c (clubs suit)\n3. There's a King on the board which could be dangerous\n4. Two spades on board means someone could have a flush\n5. I'm in position disadvantage (small blind vs button)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is the only remaining opponent with 218 chips\n- They checked preflop as big blind\n- This suggests they might have a medium-strength hand\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Pot odds: With 76 chips in pot and I can check for free\n2. Flush draw potential: I have 9 outs for flush (assuming clubs)\n3. Ace high: Could be best hand\n4. Position: I'm out of position\n\n**Options:**\n1. Check: See what opponent does, maintain pot control\n2. Raise: Try to take control of the pot with my Ace high and flush draw\n3. Fold: Too weak, but I have Ace high so this seems too nitty\n\nGiven that I have Ace high and a flush draw, and the pot is already substantial (76 chips), I think checking is the best play here. I can see what my opponent does and then make a decision on the turn. Raising might be too aggressive with just Ace high and no other strong indicators of weakness from the opponent.\n",

So we have weak hand. Opponent seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) just checked. History: seat 4 often checks flop when passive, sometimes bets big (hand 82 bet 48, hand84 bet 96). So could be strong or bluff. Our stack 218, pot 76, we are in BB, opponent 192. Minimum raise 32. With weak hand, likely check. Check is safe; maybe consider raise to steal?

            "reasoning_content": "We need decide action on turn. Board: 3s 7d Ks Qs. Our hand: 2c Jh. So we have gutshot straight draw? Cards: J with board K Q, need Ten for straight (10). Also have backdoor flush? Board has two spades, we have clubs, so no flush draw. We have pair of J? No J not on board. So we have overcards (J) but board already has K Q. We have gutshot open-ended? Actually need Ten to make straight: 10-J-Q-K. Also could make straight with Ace? A-2-3-4-5? No.\n\nOur hand is weak. Opponent MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 has 192 chips. They checked turn. Pot is 76. No bet. We can check or raise. Raising could be a bluff, but we have short stack (6.8 BB). Our stack 218, min raise 32 would be 32 total? Actually raise_to = total amount we put in. Currently we have posted 32 BB, plus we haven't added any. If raise to 32, that's just call? Actually amount to call is 0, min raise to 32 means we need to put 32 chips total (i.e., bet 32). So raise to 32 would be a bet of 32 chips, making pot 108. That is 0.5 BB? Actually 32 is 1 BB. So bet 32 into 76 pot, ~0.42 pot. Could be a small bet to try to steal? Opponent may have strong hand (maybe KQ, etc). Our chance of improvement: need Ten on river for straight (9 outs? Actually four tens left). Also could improve with J? Pair J on river gives pair J, but board already has K Q, so pair J is low, likely lose. So not great.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should fold? But amount to call is 0, we can check and see river free. Checking preserves chips for later. If we check and opponent bets river, we can decide. So best is check.\n\nLegal actions include fold, check, raise. Check is appropriate.\n\nThus output JSON with action check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

We have J\u2665, which gives us an open-ended straight draw? Let's see: board shows K Q 5 7 3. Our J gives potential straight with 10 and 9? Actually we need 10 and 9 to make straight: 9-10-J-Q-K would be straight, but we have only J. No 10 or 9 on board. So not a made hand. No pair. So we have high card J, not even a pair. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) has checked all streets, so likely also has weak hand or maybe a draw. River check; we can check. Raising would be a bluff. We have 6.8 BB left, short stack. Pot is 76, we have 218 chips total, but after posting BB 32, we have 186 left. Actually stack includes posted blind? Usually stack includes after posting. So we have 218 chips total (including blind). Pot 76 includes our blind 32? Yes. So we have 218-32=186 remaining. Minimum raise is 32 (to total 64). That's a small raise relative to pot (pot 76). Could attempt a bluff to steal, but opponent may have a hand like KQ, QJ, etc. Board has KQ, so many combos. Opponent checking could indicate missed draw or weak. But we are short stacked; we want to accumulate chips. Could raise to 100? Minimum raise is 32 (to total 64). We could raise more if we want. But we have limited chips, but can still raise up to all-in (218). But opponent may call with any pair, like K, Q, etc. Our hand is worthless. So best is to check and preserve stack.

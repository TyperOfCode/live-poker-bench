Not a playable hand from UTG position.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position at the table. I need a very strong hand to play from here.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 139 chips (17.4 BB) - This is a short stack. With less than 20 BB, I need to be selective and look for spots to shove or fold. I cannot afford to play marginal hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recent actions, I see:\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising preflop (raised to 16 in hand 51, and to 24 in hand 52)\n   - Seats 3, 4, and 5 have been folding frequently\n   - This suggests the table might be somewhat tight or at least the players behind me are folding to raises\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to win 12. That's 1.5:1 odds, but with Q7o from UTG, this is not a profitable call even with these odds.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 17.4 BB, I'm in the danger zone. I need to preserve my stack for better spots. Q7o from UTG is a clear fold in any situation, but especially with a short stack.\n\nThe clear decision here is to fold. Q7o is not a hand I should be playing from UTG, especially with a short stack. I need to wait for a better spot, preferably with a stronger hand or better position. This is an easy fold.",

The small blind (MiniMax-M2, 283 chips) and big blind (GPT-OSS-120B, 254 chips) are yet to act.\n\nFrom my research:\n- MiniMax-M2 tends to call frequently preflop (8 calls recorded)\n- GPT-OSS-120B raises preflop fairly often (7 raises recorded)\n\nI'm on the button, which is the best position, but with such a weak hand (85o), it's generally not playable. Even with position, this hand has very little potential to make strong hands. It's a \"trash hand\" that should almost always be folded.\n\nMy stack is 17.4 BB, which is short but not critically short. I should be looking for better spots to accumulate chips. Calling 8 chips (half a big blind) with this hand is tempting because it's cheap, but it's still likely to be -EV.\n\nConsidering tournament dynamics: I have two opponents left to act. The small blind might call or complete, and the big blind might raise. Even if I call and see a flop, I'll likely be playing a weak hand out of position against at least one opponent.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 12 (current pot) + potentially more if others call. That's 2:3 pot odds (40% equity needed). My hand doesn't have anywhere near 40% equity against random hands.\n\nGiven all this, the correct play is to fold. Save my chips for better spots with stronger starting hands.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"85o is too weak even from button position.

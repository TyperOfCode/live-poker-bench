            "reasoning_content": "  The opponent in Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been very tight - mostly folding preflop. They just raised to 48 from early position (relative to the blinds). This suggests they have a strong hand.\n\nMy hand is Q\u2665J\u2665 - suited connectors, which is a decent hand but not premium. I'm on the button, which is good position. However, I only have 143 chips (8.9 BB), so I'm in short stack territory.\n\nLet me think about this:\n- Pot is 72, I need to call 48\n- This gives me pot odds of 72:48 or 1.5:1\n- If I call, I'll have 95 chips left (5.9 BB)\n- If I raise, minimum is 80, which would leave me with 63 chips\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 has been very tight and is now raising from early position, they likely have a strong range (AA, KK, QQ, AK, maybe JJ, TT, AQ). My QJs is behind most of that range.\n\nWith my short stack, I should be looking for spots to either:\n1. Shove all-in with a strong hand\n2. Fold marginal hands and preserve chips\n\nQJs is marginal against a tight early position raiser. If I call, I'll be out of position postflop (well, I'll be in position on the button, but with only 5.9 BB left, I'm basically committed if I hit anything).\n\nActually wait - I'm ON THE BUTTON (Seat 1), so I have position. That helps. But still, with 8.9 BB, I need to be careful.\n\nLet me reconsider the pot odds. Pot is 72, I need to call 48. That's 72:48 = 1.5:1. I need 40% equity to call. Against a tight EP range (AA-QQ, AK, maybe JJ), QJs has about 35-40% equity. It's close.\n\nBut tournament equity matters too. If I lose this hand, I'm down to 95 chips (5.9 BB). If I win, I go up to 191 chips (11.9 BB).\n\nGiven that MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot and now raises, this is likely a strong hand. \n\nI'm facing a tough decision with Q\u2665J\u2665. The raiser's tight play suggests a strong hand, and my stack size makes this a critical moment. The pot odds are marginal, and calling would significantly reduce my remaining chips. While the suited connectors have some potential, the risk of losing a substantial portion of my stack outweighs the potential upside. I need to preserve my tournament life and wait for a more favorable opportunity.",

This is their first raise in the recent hands I can see. They showed Jc Tc in a showdown at hand #12.\n\n**My Hand Strength:**\n2d 6h is one of the worst possible hands - no connectivity, no suitedness, low cards. This is a clear fold in almost all situations.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have 7.7 BB, which is very short-stacked. However, 2d6o is just too weak to play from any position, even on the button. With such a short stack, I should be looking for better spots to go all-in or double up.\n\n**Position:**\nBeing on the button is good, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nI need to call 32 to win 72, which gives me 2.25:1 pot odds. However, my hand equity against a typical raising range is probably around 25-30% at best, so I'm not getting the right implied odds.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is an easy fold. 2d 6h is unplayable even with good pot odds. I should preserve my stack for a better spot. With 7.7 BB, I can wait for a better hand to go all-in.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2d6o is unplayable even on button with 7.7 BB.

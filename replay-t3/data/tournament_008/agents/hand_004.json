It plays well in multiway pots when you can hit a set, but is vulnerable otherwise.\n2. **Position**: I'm in BB with good postflop position against SB and the caller.\n3. **Pot odds**: There's 6 chips in the pot and it costs me 0 to check, so checking is free.\n4. **Opponents**: MiniMax-M2 appears very tight, folding all 3 previous hands preflop. GPT-OSS-120B seems more active. This suggests the field might be relatively weak.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 99 BB, I don't need to take unnecessary risks, but seeing a free flop with pocket pairs is generally +EV, especially in position.\n\n**Decision**: I should check here. Raising with pocket fours from BB against two callers is not advisable because:\n- If I raise and get called, I'm likely up against stronger hands\n- Pocket fours don't play well when you don't hit a set\n- I can see a free flop and only continue if I hit my set or the board is very favorable\n- The opponents don't seem overly aggressive based on limited history\n\nChecking allows me to see the flop for free and preserves my stack while maintaining good position.",

The dry board limits potential draws, suggesting opponents likely missed. A modest bet around 4-5 chips could effectively pressure opponents with marginal hands. Checking risks giving free cards to potentially stronger holdings, so a carefully sized bet appears most advantageous.",

            "content": "  The user is asking me to make a decision in a poker hand. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand Situation:**\n- Position: BB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: 4d 4h (pocket 4s)\n- Stack: 193 chips (96.5 BB)\n- Board: 9h 5d 3c 7d\n- Pot: 16 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Action History:**\n- Preflop: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) called 2, GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) called 1 (small blind), I checked\n- Flop: GPT-OSS-120B checked, I bet 5, MiniMax-M2 called, GPT-OSS-120B folded\n- Turn: It's on me to act\n\n**Current Board Analysis:**\nThe board is 9h 5d 3c 7d. This gives me:\n- No made hand - just pocket 4s\n- No flush draw (I don't have diamonds)\n- No straight draw currently (I would need a 6 for a straight)\n\nHowever, looking at the board: 9-5-3-7. If a 6 comes on the river, I would have a straight (3-4-5-6-7). So I have an open-ended straight draw (need a 6).\n\n**Opponent Information:**\nI just called the function to get MiniMax-M2's actions. The result shows:\n- Hand 1: preflop fold\n- Hand 2: preflop fold\n- Hand 3: preflop fold\n\nSo in the first 3 hands, MiniMax-M2 folded preflop every time. This is the first time they've reached the flop/turn.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot is 16 chips\n- I can check for free\n- If I bet, minimum raise is 5 (this is a bit confusing - usually minimum raise would be 10 if the previous bet was 5, but they're saying minimum raise to 5)\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Very weak currently - just pocket 4s with no pair. But I have an open-ended straight draw (8 outs - four 6s and four 2s? Wait, let me recalculate).\n\nActually, for a straight: 3-4-5-6-7 would be a straight. I have 4-4. So I need a 6. That's 4 outs. I also could hit a 4 for a set (2 outs). So total outs = 6.\n\nWait, let me think again about the straight possibility. The board is 9-5-3-7. For a straight with my 4:\n- 2-3-4-5-6? No, that would be 2-3-4-5-6 but the board has 7 not 6.\n- 3-4-5-6-7? Yes! If a 6 comes, I have 3-4-5-6-7.\n\nI have 4 outs to the straight (four 6s) and 2 outs to a set (two more 4s). Total 6 outs.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position (BB) against MiniMax-M2\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight so far - folded first 3 hands preflop. This is their first time seeing a flop, and they called my flop bet.\n4. **Pot Odds**: If I check, I see a free card. If I bet, I risk more chips.\n5. **Stack**: I have a healthy stack of 193 chips.\n\n**Opponent's Range**:\nSince MiniMax-M2 has been very tight (folding 3 hands preflop) but called preflop this time and called my flop bet, they likely have:\n- A decent hand like top pair (9x, 5x, 3x)\n- A straight draw (they could have 6x for the same straight draw)\n- Two pair or a set\n- Possibly a flush draw if they have diamonds\n\nWhen they called my flop bet on a board of 9-5-3, they could have:\n- Any 9 (top pair)\n- Any 5 or 3 (middle/bottom pair)\n- A straight draw with 6-7 or 6-4 or 6-2\n- Overcards\n- A flush draw with two diamonds\n\n**My Decision**:\nI have a weak hand with some outs (6 outs = ~12% chance to improve on river). I'm out of position. The opponent has shown strength by calling my flop bet. I should check and see a free card. There's no value in betting here because:\n- Better hands will call or raise\n- Worse hands will"

This is the first time they've seen a flop/turn. They called my flop bet of 5 chips.\n\n**Opponent's Range:**\nSince they've been very tight preflop but called the flop, they likely have:\n- Top pair (9x)\n- Middle/bottom pair (5x, 3x, 7x)\n- Straight draw (6x)\n- Flush draw (two diamonds)\n- Two pair or set\n\n**Decision:**\nI'm out of position with a weak draw. I have 6 outs. The pot is 16 chips. \n\nOptions:\n1. **Check**: See a free card, preserve chips. This is the conservative play.\n2. **Bet**: Try to get opponent to fold better hands or build pot if I hit. But opponent called flop, so they likely have something.\n3. **Fold**: Definitely not, I can check for free.\n\nThe best play is to check. I have a marginal draw, I'm out of position, and I don't want to build a bigger pot with a weak hand. Checking allows me to see the river for free and preserves my stack.\n\nLet me format the response correctly as JSON:\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have pocket 4s with an open-ended straight draw (need a 6) and 6 outs total.

My hand: Pocket 4s are very weak here. The board has 4 cards to a straight and 3 diamonds. Anyone with a 6 has a straight. Anyone with two diamonds has a flush draw. Anyone with a 9, 8, 7, 5, or 3 likely has me beat.\n\n2. The opponent called preflop (could be with connectors, suited cards, broadway, pairs) and called my flop bet. Now they're betting the turn after I showed weakness by checking. This is a strong signal of strength.\n\n3. I'm getting 3:1 pot odds, but I only have 2 outs (the remaining 4s) to improve to a set, which is about 4.5% chance. That's not enough to call.\n\n4. Even if I hit a 6 for a straight, someone could have a higher straight with 8-6 or a flush.\n\n5. My opponent's betting pattern suggests they have something - could be a made straight, two pair, top pair, or a strong draw.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold.

            "reasoning_content": "Based on my analysis, I have pocket sixes on the button facing a check from Kimi-K2 Thinking. I need to make a decision here. Let me think through this carefully:\n\n1. My hand: 6c 6d - pocket sixes, a decent made hand\n2. The board: 9h 5d 3c 7d - there's a potential straight with 6-10, but I'm holding the 6d so that straight isn't possible for opponents\n3. Opponent: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been very tight (folded preflop in all 3 previous hands I can see)\n4. Position: I'm in position on the button, which is advantageous\n5. Pot: 16 chips, which is substantial\n6. Stack sizes: I have 190 chips (95 BB), which is a healthy stack\n\nThe opponent checked to me, which could mean:\n- They have a weak hand and are checking to showdown\n- They have a medium hand and are pot controlling\n- They might be trapping with a stronger hand\n\nGiven that Kimi-K2 Thinking has been very tight (folding preflop in all previous hands I can see), their range is likely weighted toward weaker hands. This makes my pocket sixes relatively strong.\n\nI have three options:\n1. Check behind - this is safe but I miss value\n2. Bet small - around 5-8 chips to get value from worse hands\n3. Bet larger - around 10-12 chips to extract more value\n\nSince I have position and a decent hand, and the opponent appears tight, I should bet for value. A bet of around 8 chips (about half pot) seems appropriate. This is substantial enough to get called by worse hands but not so large as to scare them away.\n\nThe minimum raise is 5, but I should bet more than the minimum to extract value. I'll bet 8 chips.\n",

So we face a 1 chip call. Minimum raise to 4 (so raise to total 4 chips). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand: 8d Jh unsuited. In SB with 112.5 BB, deep stack. Opponent called big blind, likely a wide-ish range maybe. 8J is a decent suited? It's off-suit, not great but can be played from SB sometimes against a single caller. The opponent's stack is 195 chips, similar. The pot now is SB (1) + BB (2) + opponent call (2) = 5. If we call, we put 1 more, pot becomes 6, we go to flop with 8J off-suit, stack 224 after call. If we raise to 4, we add 3 more chips (since we already posted 1). That would be a raise of 2? Actually raise to 4 total means we put total of 4 chips into pot. We have already 1, so need to add 3. That is a raise of 2 over the call amount (which is 2). Minimum raise is 4 total, so raise size is 2 over call. That is a small raise, typical to isolate. Could also consider folding but 8J is decent to see a cheap flop.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: we have no data. Could be random. Raising could isolate and give us position (post-flop we will be out of position because we are SB after BB and opponent is in BB? Actually after raise, the action will be on BB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) and opponent (MiniMax-M2) who called the big blind; but we raised, so both must act. The BB will act first (since SB raises, action goes to BB then to other players). So we would be out of position post-flop. So raising may not be great.\n\nGiven we have a mediocre hand, probably best to just call the 1 chip and see flop cheap. 8J offsuit can make top pair, straight draws. So call.\n\nThus decision: call.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: SB (seat5) with 8d Jh. Board 9h 5d 3c. Pot 6 chips (small). Opponent: Seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called preflop, now after seat1 (BB) checked, it's our turn (SB). Seat4 hasn't acted yet? Actually order: SB is seat5, then BB seat1, then seat4 (CO?) Wait positions: seat5 SB, seat1 BB, seat4 is MP? Actually seat numbers: seat1 is BB, seat2 is maybe UTG? seat3? but irrelevant. The action order preflop: seat5 post sb (small blind) 1, seat1 post bb 2, seat2 fold, seat3 fold, seat4 call 2 (so limp), seat5 call 1 (complete sb), seat1 check (BB checks). So after preflop, we have three players: seat1 BB, seat4, seat5. The flop: board 9h5d3c. Action: seat1 checked, now seat4 acts? Actually order is seat4 (UTG?) but seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB, seat4 is CO? In typical order, after flop, action starts with first active player left of button. Button is seat5? Actually button is seat5? In heads-up? No, there are 5 seats but only 3 active. The button likely seat5? Actually seat5 is SB, seat1 BB, seat4 is maybe UTG? Usually button is seat? Not given. But we have amount to call 0, meaning it's our turn with no bet. So we can check or raise. Evaluate hand: 8d Jh, board 9h 5d 3c. We have gutshot straight draw? 8-J, board 9,5,3. Straight possibilities: 7-8-9-10-J? We have J, need 10 for open-ended? Actually we have 8 and J, board 9. So we have inside straight draw: need 10 to make 8-9-10-J? That would be 8-9-10-J? That's only four cards, need also 7 or Q? Let's examine: With 8 and J, possible straight combos: 7-8-9-10-J (needs 7 and 10) not possible. 8-9-10-J-Q (needs 10 and Q). So we have two outs? Actually need 10 to make 8-9-10-J? That's only four cards, need also something else? Straight of 8-9-10-J-Q requires Q also. So we need both 10 and Q? That's too many. So we have no straight draw. We have gutshot? 8-J with board 9-5-3: if a 7 comes, we have 7-8-9-? need? Not. So no immediate draw.\n\nWe have a backdoor flush draw? We have Jh, board has heart 9h, we have Jh (heart). So we have a flush draw with hearts: need two more hearts on turn and river. Currently one heart on board, we have one heart in hand, so two hearts needed for flush.\n\nWe have pair? No pair. So we have overcards (J) and 8 is middle. Not strong.\n\nOpponent seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called preflop, likely a wide range limp. They may have anything. They checked on flop. So likely they have weak or medium hand.\n\nGiven our stack 224, pot 6, we can check. Raising may be possible to steal? But we are out of position (SB) and opponent is in front (likely seat4 is next to act). We could attempt a small raise to take pot, but risk being called with better hand.\n\nBetter to check and see turn. So action: check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise.

Let's compute: preflop pot: blinds 1+2=3, plus call 2 from seat4, call 1 from seat5, plus seat1 check (no bet). So pot after preflop = 3+2+1 =6? Wait blinds: SB posts 1, BB posts 2, seat4 (UTG?) calls 2, seat5 calls 1, seat1 checks. So total chips in pot: 1+2+2+1 =6. Then flop: seat5 (SB) checked, seat1 (BB) bet 5, seat4 (UTG?) called 5. So pot after flop: previous 6 + bet 5 + call 5 =16. Yes.\n\nNow we are seat5, we have to act after seat1 bet 5 and seat4 called. So we face 5 to call. Our hand: 8d Jh. Board: 9h 5d 3c. We have gutshot straight draw? 8 and J, board 9,5,3. Straight possibilities: 7-8-9-10-J? Actually we have J and 8, board 9. So we have open-ended? Let's list: With 8 and J, we have potential straight: 7-8-9-10-J (needs 7 and 10). Only 9 on board. Also 8-9-10-J-Q (needs 10 and Q). So we have two inside draws, not great. We have a backdoor flush draw? We have Jh, board has hearts 9h. So we have one heart, need two more hearts on turn/river, low chance. Overall hand is weak. No pair. So likely fold.\n\nBut consider opponent tendencies: Seat1 (BB) bet 5 on flop, small bet. Could be continuation bet with missed overcards. Seat4 called. Seat4 is MiniMax-M2, unknown. Could be a weak call.\n\nOur stack 224, pot 16, bet is 5 (approx 0.31 pot). We could call cheap to see turn. But we have weak hand, low equity. Could consider calling as a cheap speculative play? Let's compute pot odds: need 5 to win 16+5=21? Actually pot after call would be 21 (16+5). So pot odds 5/21 = 23.8%. Our equity likely less than that? Let's estimate: With 8h Jh vs unknown range of seat1 (BB) and seat4 (call). Our hand may have about 10-12% equity maybe. So not worth call.\n\nThus fold.\n\nWe must output JSON.\n\n"

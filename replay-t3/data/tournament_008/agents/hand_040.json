            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: Th Kd (King-Ten offsuit)\n**Position**: SB (Small Blind) - one of the worst positions\n**Stack**: 143 chips (35.8 BB)\n**Situation**: Facing a raise from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) to 12 chips (3x BB)\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: \nFrom the data I retrieved, GPT-OSS-120B has been quite active preflop with raises in hands 10, 15, 17, 19, and 24. They made a large raise (30) in hand 24, then another raise on the flop (60). They've also folded many times recently (hands 29, 30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37). In hand 39, they called then folded.\n\nThe pattern suggests they raise with a wide range but also fold frequently. The current raise to 12 seems standard.\n\n**Hand Strength**:\n- KTo is a marginal hand, especially from SB\n- Dominated by KJ, KQ, AK\n- Decent against weaker hands but vulnerable\n- In SB, I'm out of position for the entire hand\n\n**Pot odds**: Need to call 10 chips to win 18 (already 2+4+12). That's 10/28 = 35.7% equity needed.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have 35.8 BB, a healthy stack\n- Don't want to play big pots out of position with marginal hands\n- Could 3-bet as a squeeze play since it's just me and BB left\n\n**Decision**: \nFrom SB, KTo is a fold against a standard raise. It's too weak to call out of position, and 3-betting would be a bluff that risks too many chips. The opponent's raise size is standard, and while they fold sometimes, they're not super tight. \n\nI should fold and preserve my chips for better spots.",

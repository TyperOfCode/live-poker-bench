            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My Hand:** Jc 7d - This is a weak offsuit hand with no suitedness and marginal connectivity. Jack-high with a 7 kicker is not a strong hand.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position post-flop. This gives me some advantage.\n\n**Stack:** 137 chips (34.2 BB) - I'm in decent shape, not short-stacked.\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - Has been fairly active with a mix of folds, raises, and calls. From the data, they raised in hands 24 and 28, called in hands 24 and 30, and folded often. They showed down K9o in hand 30. They seem to be playing a reasonable range.\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - Has been quite passive, folding most hands. They called small bets in hands 22, 26, and 27, but folded to most aggression. They seem tight.\n\n**Pot:** 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n\n**Action:** I need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** J7o is a weak hand that should be folded in most situations. The only redeeming factor is my position on the button.\n2. **Opponent Tendencies:** \n   - SB (Kimi-K2) seems moderately aggressive, capable of raising with decent hands\n   - BB (DeepSeek-V3.2) is tight and folds to aggression often\n3. **Pot Odds:** I need to call 4 to win 6, so 1.5:1 pot odds. This is not enough to justify playing a weak hand.\n4. **Implied Odds:** With J7o, I don't have good implied odds. If I hit a Jack, I could be dominated by better Jacks. If I hit two pair, it's vulnerable. The only really strong hand I can make is a straight (which is unlikely).\n5. **Tournament Considerations:** I have a decent stack and there's no need to gamble with a weak hand. Better opportunities will come.\n\n\nI'll cut my losses and wait for a stronger hand. Folding is the most prudent move here, preserving my chips for a better opportunity. The weak hand combined with unfavorable pot odds makes this an easy decision.",

However, given the BB's tendency to fold frequently, a small raise to try to take down the pot immediately is a good play. A5o plays well as a steal attempt here.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 12,\n  \"reasoning\": \"BB folds frequently (4/5 recent hands), I have position, and A5o is a good steal hand.

The SB (Kimi-K2) has raised to 12 total (8 more for me to call). The pot is 16 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise).\n\nLooking at the opponent data: Kimi-K2 has shown some aggression. In hand 28, they raised preflop and then continued betting on flop, turn. In hand 30, they called a raise preflop and then called bets on flop, turn, checked river. They seem like a reasonable player.\n\nMy stack is 159 chips (39.8 BB), which is healthy. The SB has 181 chips (45.3 BB). The pot odds: I need to call 8 chips to win 24 (16 current pot + 8 if I call). That's 2:1 pot odds, or 33% equity needed.\n\nWith 72o, I have very little equity against a SB raising range. Even against a wide SB stealing range, 72o has maybe 30-35% equity. But I'm out of position (BB vs SB), which makes the hand even worse to play postflop.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack, no need to take marginal spots. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nThe fact that I'm getting 2:1 pot odds is tempting, but with such a terrible hand and being out of position, this is an easy fold. I should only defend with much better hands from BB against a SB raise.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern of SB raising light that I should exploit. From the data, I see Kimi-K2 raised once preflop (hand 28) and folded twice, called once. Not enough data to say they're raising super light from SB.\n\nGiven all this, folding is correct."

The SB (Kimi-K2) has raised to 12 total (8 more for me to call). The pot is 16 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise).\n\nLooking at the opponent data: Kimi-K2 has shown some aggression. In hand 28, they raised preflop and then continued betting on flop, turn. In hand 30, they called a raise preflop and then called bets on flop, turn, checked river. They seem like a reasonable player.\n\nMy stack is 159 chips (39.8 BB), which is healthy. The SB has 181 chips (45.3 BB). The pot odds: I need to call 8 chips to win 24 (16 current pot + 8 if I call). That's 2:1 pot odds, or 33% equity needed.\n\nWith 72o, I have very little equity against a SB raising range. Even against a wide SB stealing range, 72o has maybe 30-35% equity. But I'm out of position (BB vs SB), which makes the hand even worse to play postflop.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack, no need to take marginal spots. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nThe fact that I'm getting 2:1 pot odds is tempting, but with such a terrible hand and being out of position, this is an easy fold. I should only defend with much better hands from BB against a SB raise.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern of SB raising light that I should exploit. From the data, I see Kimi-K2 raised once preflop (hand 28) and folded twice, called once. Not enough data to say they're raising super light from SB.\n\nGiven all this, folding is correct.",

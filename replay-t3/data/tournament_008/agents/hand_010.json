Q4o is just too weak to call a raise from OOP, even if the opponent might be raising light. The hand has poor equity and I'll be out of position.",

We are on button, we can either raise to isolate or just call. 9T suited is a decent hand, can raise to build pot and possibly steal blinds. Opponents may call or 3-bet. Minimum raise is 4 (to total 4). Standard raise size maybe 3x BB = 6, but we could raise to 8 to match SB's previous raise size. Our stack is deep, can raise to 8 (total). That would be a raise of 6 (since we need to put 4 total? Wait amount to call is 2, min raise to 4 total, so raise to 8 would be +6). That's fine.\n\nWe need to consider pot odds: If we raise to 8, pot becomes 3+2+8? Actually we add 8 total, but we already call 2? No, raise to 8 means we put 8 chips total, not additional. So we put 8, pot becomes 3 (existing) + 8 (our raise) = 11 plus any other calls. Opponent may call 2 more (SB) and BB may call 6 more (since they already posted 2). Actually they posted 1 and 2, we raise to 8, they need to call 7 (SB) and 6 (BB) to see flop. That is large. Might discourage them.\n\nGiven their tendencies: BB raises to 6 often, maybe they like to raise from BB with decent hands. SB also raised to 8 previously, maybe they are aggressive.\n\nOur hand 9T suited is good for flop, but not premium. Might want to just call to see flop cheap, but we are on button and can take initiative. However raising may get us all-in if they re-raise. But stack sizes are deep enough.\n\nI think optimal: raise to 8 to isolate BB or SB, leveraging position. Reasoning: hand is strong, position, can win bigger pot, and opponents seem willing to call raises but also may fold.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 8.\n\n",

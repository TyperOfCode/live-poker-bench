Not connected, not suited.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position postflop, but we're preflop now.\n\n**Stack**: 181 chips (90.5 BB) - Deep stack, healthy.\n\n**Pot**: 3 chips (1 from SB, 2 from BB)\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 - 197 chips\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 - 166 chips\n\n**Amount to call**: 2 chips\n\n**Opponent tendencies from memory**:\n- Kimi-K2 (SB): Very tight! Has folded preflop in 8 out of 10 recent hands. Only raised twice (both to 6 chips). Seems passive and tight.\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB): Also very tight! Has folded preflop in 7 out of 10 recent hands. Called once (hand #12) and checked down to showdown with Q3 suited, losing.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 84o is trash. Bottom 15% of hands.\n2. **Position**: Good position (BTN) but hand is too weak.\n3. **Opponents**: Both opponents are extremely tight, folding most hands.\n4. **Pot odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3 (1.5:1). Not good enough for this hand.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. No need to gamble with trash.\n\nWhile I could consider stealing since both opponents are tight, 84o is just too weak. Even if they fold 80% of the time, when they call I'm in terrible shape. The risk/reward isn't worth it.\n\n**Decision**: FOLD. This is a clear fold. Hand is too weak, even against tight opponents. Preserve chips for better spots.",

This suggests they defend their blind selectively.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: With 98.5 BBs effective, I have room to maneuver.\n\n5. **My recent play**: I've been folding very frequently (12 out of 15 hands), so I should consider mixing in some steals.\n\nGiven the tight BB player and my position, this is a good spot to attempt a steal.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- My hand: Tc Qc (Ten of clubs, Queen of clubs)\n- Board: 9c Jh Ad (9 clubs, Jack hearts, Ace diamonds)\n- Position: BB, facing opponent in SB who raised preflop to 6 and then checked on flop\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- My stack: 162 chips (81 BB)\n- Opponent stack: 192 chips\n\n**Hand strength:**\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (need a King for a straight: Qc-Tc-9c-Jh-Ad, K would give me Q-K-T-J-9 straight)\n- Backdoor flush draw (two clubs, board has one club)\n- Very weak made hand - Queen high with one overcard to board (Queen vs Jack and 9)\n- Ace on board is a concern - opponent could have Ace-x\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the data, opponent (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) has raised preflop 3 times out of 15 hands (hands 2, 7, 8). They've folded a lot recently (hands 9-15 all folds preflop). This suggests they might be tightening up or had weak cards. Their preflop raise to 6 (3x BB) is standard.\n\n**Flop analysis:**\nBoard is 9c Jh Ad - this is a relatively dry board except for the Ace. The flop likely missed many hands. Opponent checked after raising preflop, which could mean:\n1. They have a weak Ace (A-x with weak kicker)\n2. They missed completely (like KQ, Q10, etc.)\n3. They're slow-playing a strong hand (AA, AJ, A9, sets) - less likely since they'd probably bet for value\n\n**My options:**\n1. **Check**: Take free card, see turn. With my draws, this is reasonable.\n2. **Raise**: Semi-bluff with draws. Could represent an Ace or strong hand.\n\n**Stack considerations:** I have 81 BB, opponent has 96 BB. I'm not short-stacked.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 12 chips. If I bet, I'd need fold equity or good implied odds for draws.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that opponent checked after raising preflop, they likely don't have a strong Ace or set. They might have missed or have a weak Ace. I have decent draws: gutshot straight (4 outs) + backdoor flush (roughly 1.5 outs) + maybe Queen outs if they have weak Ace (3 outs). That's about 8.5 outs total, ~18% equity.\n\nA semi-bluff bet could win the pot now if they fold weak hands. If they call, I still have decent equity. Minimum raise is to 4 chips (bet 2 chips), but I should bet more for fold equity.\n\nI think a moderate bet of 6-8 chips (half pot) is good. Let me bet 8 chips (raise to 8 total, betting 6 into 12 pot). This gives me good fold equity while not overcommitting.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Semi-bluff with gutshot straight draw and backdoor flush draw.

Let me think through the considerations:\n\n**Hand Strength**: Th 5h is a very weak hand, especially suited connectors in the lower range. It's not a premium hand that I should be playing from UTG.\n\n**Position**: UTG is the worst position to play a weak hand like this. I'm the first to act preflop, which means I have no information about what other players might do.\n\n**Stack Considerations**: I'm at 112.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. I don't need to take big risks to stay alive in the tournament.\n\n**Tournament Considerations**: In a tournament setting, especially with a healthy stack, preservation is important. I should avoid playing weak hands from early position.\n\n**Pot Odds**: While the pot odds are decent (3 chips in pot, need to call 2 to see flop), this doesn't justify playing a weak hand from a bad position.\n\n**Opponent Information**: I should check if I have any information about these specific opponents to inform my decision.\n\nGiven all these factors, folding Th 5h from UTG position is the correct play. This is a classic example of a hand that's too weak to play from early position, even if the pot odds seem attractive.\n\nLet me fold this hand.\n",

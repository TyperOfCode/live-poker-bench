            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - This is good position\n- Cards: 5c Td (5 of clubs, 10 of diamonds) - This is offsuit, gap hand. Not very strong.\n- Stack: 151 chips (9.4 BB) - Short stacked\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- Action: SB (Seat 5) posted 8 and called the additional 8 to complete to 16\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nLooking at their recent history:\n- Very tight player - mostly folding (hands 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 55, 56, 57, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63)\n- Only called once (hand 54) and then folded\n- Only raised once (hand 45) with amount 24\n- This player is in SB position and just called to complete\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- 5c Td is a weak hand, especially offsuit with a 5-gap\n- On the button, we have position advantage\n- We're short stacked with 9.4 BB\n- The opponent is very tight and just limped from SB\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak, but we have position\n2. **Stack size**: Short at 9.4 BB - we need to be careful but also look for spots to accumulate\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight player who limped - this suggests they don't have a premium hand\n4. **Pot odds**: There's 32 in pot, it costs us 0 to check. If we raise, minimum is 32.\n5. **Tournament**: With 9.4 BB, we need to preserve our stack but also can't be too passive\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Check**: Free flop with a weak hand in position. We can see if we hit something. \n2. **Raise**: Minimum raise to 32 (2x BB). This would be about 21% of our stack. Given how tight opponent is, a raise might take it down preflop. But if they call, we're out of position post-flop with a weak hand.\n\n**Recommendation**: Check. Here's why:\n- Our hand is too weak to invest 21% of our short stack\n- We have position, so we can see a free flop\n- The opponent is tight, so if we hit something decent, we might get value\n- If we miss, we can easily fold with minimal loss\n- Raising with this hand commits too much of our stack with poor equity\n\nLet me check what the minimum raise is again. It says \"Minimum raise to: 32\". Since the big blind is 16, a minimum raise would be to 32 total (an additional 16). That would be 32 chips from our 151 stack, which is about 21% of our stack. That's too much for this weak hand.\n\nChecking is the correct play here.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My cards: 5c Td (offsuit, very weak)\n- Board: 2d Qc Kd \n- Pot: 112 chips\n- Bet to call: 80 chips\n- My stack: 151 chips\n- Position: BTN\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have absolutely nothing. No pair, no draw, just T-high.\n- The board has Q-K which could easily hit opponent's range.\n- I have a backdoor flush draw with Td, but it's very weak.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n- Very tight player - mostly folding preflop\n- Only called once (hand 54) and folded preflop\n- Made one preflop raise in hand 45\n- Only postflop action seen was a fold on flop in hand 43\n- This is their first postflop bet we've seen\n\nGiven that they're typically very tight and are now betting 80 into a 112 pot (a large bet), this likely represents significant strength. They're betting ~71% of pot with a tight player's range.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 112\n- To call: 80\n- Pot odds: 112:80 or 1.4:1\n- I need ~42% equity to call\n\n**My equity:**\nWith T-high on a Q-K board, I have essentially 0% equity against any reasonable betting range. Even if they're bluffing, I have no showdown value.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 9.4 BB left, which is short but not desperate\n- Calling 80 would leave me with only 71 chips (4.4 BB)\n- This would severely cripple my stack\n- Preserving my stack for better spots is crucial\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. I have no hand, no draw, facing a large bet from a tight player, and calling would decimate my stack. The only consideration is that they're in SB vs my BB, so they could be defending wide, but given their tight history, this bet likely means business.\n\nI should fold and preserve my 151 chips for a better opportunity.",

I'm not short-stacked yet, but I need to be careful.\n\n4. **Opponents**: \n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): 151 chips - From my memory, they've been active with some raises recently (hands 60 and 61 they raised)\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 234 chips - They've been folding a lot recently (hands 59-63 they folded preflop)\n\n5. **Action**: I need to call 16 chips to stay in the hand, or I can raise to at least 32 chips.\n\n6. **Analysis**: With 2h 4d, I'm facing a call of 16 chips into a pot of 24 chips. The pot odds are 24:16 or 1.5:1, which means I need to win about 40% of the time to make this call profitable. With this weak hand, I have almost no chance of winning unless I hit a miracle flop (very unlikely).\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: I'm not short-stacked yet, but I need to preserve my chips. Playing weak hands like this is how you get eliminated from tournaments.\n\n8. **Opponent tendencies**: Kimi-K2 Thinking has been raising recently, suggesting they might have a decent hand. \n\nGiven the hand's weakness, the risk of calling with such low-potential cards is simply not worth it. Folding is the only logical move to protect my tournament life and chip stack.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have flop: Qc 2d Kd. Our hand: Qd 4s gives us top pair Qs with kicker 4, plus a gutshot? Actually board: Qc Kd 2d. We have Qd, so pair of queens, kicker 4, board also has K. Opponent seat1 (Kimi-K2) is in BB? Actually seat1 is BB with 151 chips. Seat5 is us (BB? Actually we are BB seat5, but seat1 is BB? Wait blinds: seat5 posted sb 8, seat1 posted bb 16. So seat1 is BB, seat5 is SB. So we are SB. Preflop we called 8, seat1 checked. So on flop, seat1 is acting first (since BB). The pot is 32. Action: amount to call 0, legal actions: fold, check, raise. So we can check or raise. We need to decide.\n\nOur hand: top pair Q, but opponent may have K, A, Q, etc. Board is somewhat coordinated: a straight draw? 2-? Actually need 3-4-5 for straight, but we have 4. So we have gutshot straight draw (needs 3 or 5). Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Board has two diamonds (Qc, Kd, 2d). We have 4s, not diamond. So no flush draw.\n\nWe have ~14 BB stack, 226 chips. Opponent has 151 chips. So opponent is shorter stack. We have more chips, but still shortish.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, Kimi-K2 (seat1) has many folds preflop, occasional raises. On flop, only one recorded bet: hand 24, flop bet 30 (unknown board). So they sometimes bet on flop.\n\nGiven we have top pair but vulnerable to Kx, A, maybe also Qx with better kicker. Our kicker is weak. Might consider check-call if they bet? But we have no bet to call now; we can check or raise. Since we have top pair, we could try to protect by raising to extract value from worse hands (like K, J, 10, etc) or from draws. However we are out of position (SB vs BB? Actually after flop, action order: BB acts first, then SB. So we are out of position (SB). Raising out of position can be good to get value, but also can be risky if opponent has strong hand and raises again.\n\nOpponent stack is 151, pot 32, so they could shove all-in if they have strong hand. Minimum raise is 16 (to 16 total? Actually raise to 16 total? The pot is 32, min raise to 48? Wait: In NL Hold'em, min raise is amount of previous bet plus that amount. Since there is no bet, min raise is big blind amount (16). So raise to 16 total? Actually we have already contributed 8 (SB) and 16 (BB) preflop, pot 32 includes both. So min raise to 48? But they said minimum raise to: 16. That seems like raise amount relative to 0? Probably raise to 16 chips total added to pot? Might be ambiguous. But we just need to output raise_to number.\n\nWe can raise to e.g., 48 chips (i.e., 16 more). But we have to follow format.\n\nGiven opponent short stack, we might want to protect and maybe isolate. If we raise to about 80-100 chips, we can put pressure. But we must consider we have only 226 chips, opponent 151. If we raise to 100, opponent can call or shove. If they have a better hand (Kx, AQ, etc) they may call. If they have a draw, they may call hoping to hit.\n\nI think best is to raise to about 80 chips (approx 2.5x pot) to get value from worse hands and protect against draws. Since we are out of position, raising is good.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 80 (or maybe 96). Let's choose 80.\n\nReasoning: top pair, decent hand, opponent short stack, want value, protect.\n\n",

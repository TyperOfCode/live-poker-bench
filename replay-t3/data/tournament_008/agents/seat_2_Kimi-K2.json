This suggests they defend their blind selectively.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: With 98.5 BBs effective, I have room to maneuver.\n\n5. **My recent play**: I've been folding very frequently (12 out of 15 hands), so I should consider mixing in some steals.\n\nGiven the tight BB player and my position, this is a good spot to attempt a steal.

However, this hand has almost no playability post-flop. Even with position, J2o will be dominated by most of BB's range and will be difficult to play profitably.\n\nThe risk/reward here favors folding - I don't want to build a pot with such a weak hand, even with position advantage.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"J2o is trash even on the button, not worth investing chips with such a weak hand\"\n}",

I have a strong hand (pocket 7s) on a relatively dry board (except for the paired 10s). The pot odds are excellent at 5.1:1, and I have position. Even if the opponent has a 10, I still have 2 outs to improve to a full house.

This is a relatively weak hand - I have two outs to improve (two 7s remaining in the deck), but I'm facing significant action.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) has shown they can be aggressive when they have position. They check-raised the flop from 30 to 60, and now they're betting 44 on the turn. This line typically represents significant strength.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 44 chips into a pot of 228 chips, giving me about 5.2:1 pot odds. This means I need roughly 16% equity to make a profitable call.\n\n**Stack Considerations**: I have 101 chips left, and calling would leave me with 57 chips. This is a significant portion of my stack.\n\n**Board Texture**: The board is paired (T-T) and there are two spades for a potential flush draw. The opponent's aggressive line suggests they likely have:\n- A Ten (for trips)\n- An overpair (AA, KK, QQ, JJ)\n- A strong draw (like AsXs for the nut flush draw)\n\nGiven the opponent's aggression pattern and my weak holding, I need to fold here. My pocket 7s are likely behind to their range, and I don't have the right odds to chase the two-outer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Facing significant aggression from opponent who check-raised flop and now bets turn.

On the button with K6o, I can call and see a flop. If I miss completely, I can easily fold. If I hit a king, I'll have top pair with a weak kicker, but position will help me navigate post-flop.

The only hand I played was pocket 7s which I raised.\n\n5. **Opponent Tendencies**: Recent preflop actions show opponents are folding frequently, suggesting they're playing tight.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 41 BB, I need to preserve chips and look for better spots.\n\nQ7s UTG is a clear fold in this situation.

DeepSeek called my turn bet after both checked the flop, suggesting they have something but likely not stronger than two pair. I need to extract value from worse hands like:\n- Single pair hands (KJ, AJ, KQ)\n- Worse two pair (unlikely but possible)\n- They might even call with just an Ace\n\nA reasonable value bet would be around 20-24 chips.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Have strong two pair, need to extract value from worse hands that will call\"\n}",

They raised preflop from SB and are now betting flop.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 24 to win 80 (24/80 = 30% equity needed).\n\n4. **Stack considerations**: I have 153 chips (19.1 BB) which is healthy but not deep.\n\n5. **Board texture**: The Qh5h3h board is coordinated with potential flush draws and straight possibilities.\n\nGiven this opponent's tight nature, when they do play and show aggression, they likely have a strong hand. The fact they raised preflop from SB after folding so many hands suggests they have something like AQ, KQ, QJ, or a strong ace. \n\nMy bottom pair is unlikely to be good here, and even if I hit my 3 on the turn, I could be walking into a bigger hand.

This suggests I've been playing very tight, possibly too tight for tournament poker with a short stack.\n\nHowever, Q5o is simply too weak to call off 85% of my stack.

They bet the flop for 2 chips and now the turn for 8 chips, showing strength.\n2. **My draws**: I have a gutshot to the 7 for a straight, but that's only 4 outs. I also have two overcards with my K and J.\n3. **Board texture**: This board is very dangerous - any 7 gives a straight, and there are flush draws possible.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 25 (17 + 8), so about 32% pot odds.\n5. **Hand strength**: With just King-high, I'm likely behind to most of opponent's betting range here.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold.

This is a relatively weak hand - I have two outs to improve (two 7s remaining in the deck), but I'm facing significant action.\n\n**Opponent Analysis**: The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) has shown they can be aggressive when they have position. They check-raised the flop from 30 to 60, and now they're betting 44 on the turn. This line typically represents significant strength.\n\n**Pot Odds**: I need to call 44 chips into a pot of 228 chips, giving me about 5.2:1 pot odds. This means I need roughly 16% equity to make a profitable call.\n\n**Stack Considerations**: I have 101 chips left, and calling would leave me with 57 chips. This is a significant portion of my stack.\n\n**Board Texture**: The board is paired (T-T) and there are two spades for a potential flush draw. The opponent's aggressive line suggests they likely have:\n- A Ten (for trips)\n- An overpair (AA, KK, QQ, JJ)\n- A strong draw (like AsXs for the nut flush draw)\n\nGiven the opponent's aggression pattern and my weak holding, I need to fold here. My pocket 7s are likely behind to their range, and I don't have the right odds to chase the two-outer.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Facing significant aggression from opponent who check-raised flop and now bets turn.

This is a perfect spot to get all my chips in with such a strong hand.\n\n4. **Board texture**: The board is relatively dry with no obvious draws completing on the turn. The 6c doesn't change much except for potentially making a straight draw for 35 or a flush draw for clubs.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With only 18.2 BB left, I need to be looking for spots to double up. With a set in this situation, this is definitely a spot to commit my chips.\n\n**Decision**: I should bet for value and to get all my chips in the middle. Since the pot is 60 and I have 73, a bet of around 30-35 would set up a river shove, but with such a strong hand I should just get it all in now.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 73,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have a set of jacks which is extremely strong on this board.

Given the opponent's tight image and their preflop raise + flop bet, they likely have a strong hand.

My opponent check-called preflop, then bet flop, bet turn, and checked river\n2. This betting pattern suggests they likely have something but are not confident about it\n3. The ten on the river completes some straight draws (98 would have the nuts)\n4. I'm risking my entire tournament on this decision\n\n**My hand strength:**\n- Two pair is strong here, but there are several hands that beat me:\n  - Any straight (98, T8, 87, etc.)\n  - Any set (KK, 99, TT, 66, 77)\n  - Two pair with a better kicker (AK, KQ, KJ)\n\nGiven that my opponent checked the river after aggressive betting on earlier streets, this often indicates either:\n1. They're giving up on a bluff\n2. They have a medium-strength hand they're unsure about\n\nWith only 73 chips left and a 120 chip pot, I need to be very careful.

On the button with K6o, I can call and see a flop. If I miss completely, I can easily fold. If I hit a king, I'll have top pair with a weak kicker, but position will help me navigate post-flop. The 2BB raise is standard, so I'm not facing an unusually large sizing.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"On the button with K6o against a standard 2BB raise.

Position is crucial here.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: DeepSeek-V3.2 has folded 8/10 times from the big blind, showing they're very tight OOP.

I should either call and see a flop or raise to apply pressure to this tight opponent.

The pot odds aren't compelling enough to call given the opponent's betting pattern.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Opponent's sudden river aggression after passive play, combined with coordinated board making straights/flushes possible, suggests my two pair is likely beat.

DeepSeek called my turn bet after both checked the flop, suggesting they have something but likely not stronger than two pair. I need to extract value from worse hands like:\n- Single pair hands (KJ, AJ, KQ)\n- Worse two pair (unlikely but possible)\n- They might even call with just an Ace\n\nA reasonable value bet would be around 20-24 chips.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Have strong two pair, need to extract value from worse hands that will call\"\n}",

They raised preflop from SB and are now betting flop.\n\n3. **Pot odds**: I need to call 24 to win 80 (24/80 = 30% equity needed).\n\n4. **Stack considerations**: I have 153 chips (19.1 BB) which is healthy but not deep.\n\n5. **Board texture**: The Qh5h3h board is coordinated with potential flush draws and straight possibilities.\n\nGiven this opponent's tight nature, when they do play and show aggression, they likely have a strong hand. The fact they raised preflop from SB after folding so many hands suggests they have something like AQ, KQ, QJ, or a strong ace. \n\nMy bottom pair is unlikely to be good here, and even if I hit my 3 on the turn, I could be walking into a bigger hand.

The hand has poor equity against the BB's likely defending range, and I don't want to risk 8 chips (1 BB) with such a weak holding when I have a healthy stack.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"T8o is too weak to play against the BB who has been defending aggressively.

This suggests I've been playing very tight, possibly too tight for tournament poker with a short stack.\n\nHowever, Q5o is simply too weak to call off 85% of my stack.

In hand #61, MiniMax-M2 folded to a raise, and in hand #60, both blinds folded.\n\n4. **Position**: I'm on the BTN, which is the best position in poker.\n\nWith Qs Js and my current stack size, this is an ideal spot to shove all-in and apply maximum pressure. The blinds are likely to fold frequently, and if I get called, I have a strong hand that plays well against most calling ranges.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 157,\n  \"reasoning\": \"QJs is a premium hand with 9.8 BB on BTN.

Given that MiniMax-M2 has folded 4 straight hands preflop, a steal attempt makes sense here. I should raise to put pressure on them.\n\nHowever, 8h 5s is a very weak hand and if I get called, I'll be in tough shape postflop.

Even then, I'd likely still lose to a flush, but at least I'd have some equity.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Drawing completely dead against any heart with 4 hearts on board.

Pocket 4s are decent but vulnerable, and being UTG means I could face pressure from the remaining players. The hand has good set-mining potential, especially since both opponents seem to be playing relatively tight.\n\nGiven my stack size and position, I think calling to see the flop is the most prudent play. This keeps me in the hand with a chance to hit a set while not overcommitting chips preflop.

This suggests they might be getting desperate or have a premium hand.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Also been mostly folding, but made raises in hands #72 (40 chips) and #77 (48 chips). \n\n**Position considerations:**\n- UTG with pocket 4s is tricky. While 4s are decent, being UTG means I have to act first and face potential raises from later positions\n- If I just call, I might face raises from the 3 remaining players\n- If I raise, I'm committing chips with a hand that may not be strong enough to withstand action\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- I'm at 19 BB, so I'm not short-stacked yet but getting there\n- The blinds are 8/16, so I'm approaching the danger zone\n- Need to be careful about protecting my stack\n\n**Hand strength assessment:**\n- Pocket 4s are about 12th in hand rankings\n- They have decent equity but are vulnerable to overpairs and straight/flush possibilities\n- UTG, this hand is probably best played as a call rather than a raise, as raising might isolate me against stronger hands\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I'm UTG with a medium-strength hand\n2. I've seen both opponents mostly folding recently, but both are capable of raising\n3. At 19 BB, I need to be somewhat aggressive but not reckless\n4. Pocket 4s play better in multi-way pots where I can hit a set\n\nI think the best play here is to call and see the flop. \n\nCalling seems like the most strategic move. It allows me to stay in the hand without committing too many chips, potentially catching a set on the flop. The moderate stack size means I need to be selective about my plays, and pocket 4s offer enough potential to justify a call. I'll wait to see how the community cards develop before making any aggressive moves.\n",

This makes their raise more credible, but also means they might be overplaying weaker hands in their limited range.\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\nAt 18 BB, I need to be somewhat careful, but pocket pairs can be profitable when I can see flops cheaply. The 16 chip call represents about 5.5% of my stack, which is reasonable for a hand with potential.\n\n**Decision:**\nI'll call the 16 chips to see the flop. While GPT-OSS-120B is tight, pocket 4s has decent equity and I'm getting good pot odds. If I hit a set on the flop, I can potentially win a big pot. If not, I can easily fold to further action.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Calling 16 chips with pocket 4s in the big blind. Getting good pot odds (16 to win 88+), and pocket pairs have decent playability. Opponent is very tight so their raise is credible, but I'm getting position and a discounted price to see the flop.\"\n}\n```",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**My hand and situation:**\n- I'm holding pocket 4s (4h 4s) in the big blind position\n- I have 288 chips (18 BB)\n- The pot is currently 72 chips\n- The action is: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 32 chips preflop\n- I need to call 16 more chips to see the flop\n\n**Analysis of GPT-OSS-120B's tendencies:**\nLooking at the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has been very passive preflop:\n- Out of 15 recent hands, they've folded 12 times\n- They've called only 2 times (once for 8 chips, once for 64 chips)\n- They raised once for 106 chips\n- They haven't shown down any hands recently\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is a tight, passive player who rarely plays hands. When they do raise (like they did here for 32 chips), it likely represents genuine strength.\n\n**My position and stack:**\n- I'm in the big blind, so I'm getting a discounted price to see the flop\n- I have 18 BB, which is a decent stack size\n- I need to decide whether to call 16 chips or fold\n\n**Hand strength analysis:**\n- Pocket 4s is a decent pocket pair, but not premium\n- Against a tight player who rarely plays, their range is likely strong\n- I'm getting good pot odds: I need to call 16 to potentially win 72+ (pot is 72, plus their bet of 32, plus my call would make it 88 total, and I might get more action)\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I'm at 18 BB, so I need to be somewhat preservation-minded\n- However, pocket pairs can be profitable if I can see flops cheaply\n- The blinds are 8/16, so this is a significant portion of my stack to invest\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I'm getting good pot odds (16 to call for a pot that will be at least 88)\n\n\n2. Pocket 4s offers solid potential for a strong hand\n3. The opponent's tight profile suggests limited competition\n4. The big blind position provides strategic flexibility\n5. With a moderate stack, I can afford to take this calculated risk\n\nThe combination of favorable pot odds, positional advantage, and the opponent's predictable playstyle makes calling a reasonable strategy. While the hand isn't premium, the mathematical and tactical considerations support staying in the hand.\n",

In the few hands where they played, they checked and called on the turn, suggesting they might be a more passive player.\n\nNow let me analyze my situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have a set of 4s on a board of Kd 5h Ad. This is a very strong hand, though the board has two high cards (K and A) which could give opponents straights or flushes.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the big blind, so I'm out of position to act first.\n\n3. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B has been very passive lately, folding most hands. They raised preflop (to 32 chips, which was 2x the big blind), but given their recent folding tendency, this could represent a decent hand.\n\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 272 chips (17 BB), opponent has 148 chips (9.25 BB). This is a medium-sized stack situation.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is 88 chips and I don't need to call anything (amount to call is 0). I can check and see what they do, or I can bet to protect my hand and build the pot.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have a very strong hand (set of 4s)\n- The opponent has been passive recently\n- I'm out of position but don't need to call\n- The board has potential straight/flush draws that could hurt me\n- I want to build a pot with my strong hand\n\nI think the best play is to bet to protect my hand and build value. I should bet enough to make draws pay and get value from hands that might call. A typical continuation bet would be around 1/2 to 2/3 pot, so around 44-58 chips.\n\nLet me raise to around 56 chips (about 2/3 pot).\n",

The board has Ace and King, which means any Ace or King beats me. Even if someone has a lower pair, they likely have me beat since 4s is the lowest possible pocket pair.\n\n2. **Opponent's Action**: The opponent made a significant raise (148 chips) after my bet. This suggests they have a very strong hand - likely they have an Ace, King, or a strong draw.\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 92 chips to potentially win 440 chips total (292 current pot + 92 my call + their 148). That's about 4.8:1 pot odds, but I'm likely drawing dead.\n\n4. **My Memory**: Looking at my history, I see I have a 27% win rate from the BB position, and I tend to fold quite often when I don't have strong hands. I also see one instance where GPT-OSS-120B raised on the flop before.\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: With 13.5 BB, I'm in a decent stack position. Calling 92 chips would leave me with only 124 chips, putting me in a difficult spot for the rest of the tournament.\n\n6. **Board Texture**: This is a terrible board for pocket 4s. Any Ace, King, or even pocket pair over 4s beats me. The opponent's raise strongly suggests they have one of these hands.\n \nThe mathematical reality is stark. With 92 chips needed to call, I'm risking a significant portion of my stack for a hand that's almost certainly beaten. The probability of improving to a set is minimal, and even then, the board's high cards pose a critical threat. Fold becomes the only logical decision to preserve tournament life.\n",

We're on button, we have to act.\n\nStack 11 BB, short stack but not ultra short. QTs is a decent hand, especially suited. In a 3-way pot with 40 chips, we are facing a 16 call to see flop. We could raise to try to steal or get value. However we have only 11 BB, but raising to 32 (minimum) would be a raise to 32 total (i.e., 16 more). That would be 2x BB, 2x small blind. That might be okay. But consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (seat2) seems to call small amounts preflop often, maybe passive. MiniMax-M2 (seat4) called 16 previously. No raises yet. So likely they are passive and will call a raise. We could raise to isolate and maybe get heads-up with one opponent. But we have 3 players; raising may cause both to call, increasing pot. With QTs suited, we have decent equity.\n\nGiven we are short stacked (11 BB), we want to preserve chips but also accumulate. Raising to 32 (i.e., 2x BB) is standard.

Let's see: possible straight: Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace. We have Q T, missing J and maybe? Actually we have Ten and Queen, board has King Ace, missing Jack. Need J and also need? Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace is straight, we have Ten and Queen, board provides King Ace, need Jack. That's one card needed, but also need? The straight would be Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace, we have Ten and Queen, need Jack, plus need? That's only one missing card, but we need 5 cards: we have T, Q, K, A, need J. So it's a gutshot (one card) not open-ended. Also we have backdoor flush draw: hearts: we have Qh, board has 5h, need two more hearts. So potential.\n\nOur hand currently: Qh Ts, board Kd 5h Ad. No pair, no made hand. We have gutshot straight draw (J) and backdoor flush.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 56 into pot 144. That's about 0.39 pot. Small bet, maybe a continuation bet or a probe. He has 216 chips, big stack relative to us (148). He could be betting with a wide range: any Ace, K, maybe draws, etc.\n\nOur stack: 148, we have 56 to call, raise min 112 (so raise to 112 total). Our effective stack is 148, we could raise to 112 (leaving us 36 behind). Could also go all-in 148.\n\nWe need to consider tournament context: we have 9.2 BB, short stack. We need to pick up chips, but also preserve. We're BTN, we raised preflop to 32 (2x BB) from 148, so we were raising. Opponent called. So opponent likely has a range of hands that call a 2x raise from BTN: could be broadway, pairs, suited connectors, etc.\n\nNow flop is K A 5. Our raise preflop with Q T is a bit speculative but okay.\n\nNow opponent bets small. Options: call, raise (maybe all-in), fold. Considering we are short stack, maybe we could shove all-in? But raise to 112 is still less than all-in. However, a raise to 112 might be seen as a semi-bluff, but we have a gutshot and backdoor flush; not strong enough to commit.\n\nOur equity vs opponent's range? Opponent likely has many combos that beat us: Aces (A?), K, maybe also draws. Our chance to improve on turn or river is limited: need J for straight (4 outs) plus maybe hearts for flush (2 more outs after turn). So about 6 outs total, ~12% per street. Not great.\n\nGiven we have 9 BB, we could consider a shove to try to double up. But we have only 148 chips, and opponent has 216, so we would be short-stack vs bigger stack. If we shove all-in (148) we risk losing our stack. But we need chips to survive.\n\nHowever, the bet is only 56, pot 144. If we call, we will have about 92 chips left (148-56). That leaves us with 5.75 BB, dangerously short. If we raise to 112 (i.e., add 56 more), we commit 112 total, leaving us 36 chips (2.25 BB). That's even worse.\n\nIf we fold, we preserve 148 but lose the chance to double up. But folding 56 into 144 when we have 9 BB may be okay if we think we are behind.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should go all-in to maximize fold equity. Our hand is not strong, but the opponent's small bet might be a probe; they may fold many weaker hands to an all-in. However, they have a big stack; they may call with many combos.\n\nBut we have Qh Ts, which has some showdown value if we hit straight or flush. But still low.\n\nI think best is to call, preserve chips? Actually calling leaves us with 92 chips, still short but we can try to see next card. If we call and miss, we may be forced to go all-in later.\n\nGiven we have only 6 outs, maybe better to fold and preserve stack for better spot. But folding 56 when we have 148 and 9 BB? That's 56/148 = 38% of stack. That's a big portion.\n\nConsidering tournament: short stack needs to find a spot to double up. Might be okay"

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop: board Kd 5h Ad, we have Qh Ts. So we have gutshot straight draw? Actually board: K A 5, we have Q T, so we have open-ended straight draw? Let's see: possible straight: Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace. We have Q T, missing J and maybe? Actually we have Ten and Queen, board has King Ace, missing Jack. Need J and also need? Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace is straight, we have Ten and Queen, board provides King Ace, need Jack. That's one card needed, but also need? The straight would be Ten-Jack-Queen-King-Ace, we have Ten and Queen, need Jack, plus need? That's only one missing card, but we need 5 cards: we have T, Q, K, A, need J. So it's a gutshot (one card) not open-ended. Also we have backdoor flush draw: hearts: we have Qh, board has 5h, need two more hearts. So potential.\n\nOur hand currently: Qh Ts, board Kd 5h Ad. No pair, no made hand. We have gutshot straight draw (J) and backdoor flush.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 56 into pot 144. That's about 0.39 pot. Small bet, maybe a continuation bet or a probe. He has 216 chips, big stack relative to us (148). He could be betting with a wide range: any Ace, K, maybe draws, etc.\n\nOur stack: 148, we have 56 to call, raise min 112 (so raise to 112 total). Our effective stack is 148, we could raise to 112 (leaving us 36 behind). Could also go all-in 148.\n\nWe need to consider tournament context: we have 9.2 BB, short stack. We need to pick up chips, but also preserve. We're BTN, we raised preflop to 32 (2x BB) from 148, so we were raising. Opponent called. So opponent likely has a range of hands that call a 2x raise from BTN: could be broadway, pairs, suited connectors, etc.\n\nNow flop is K A 5. Our raise preflop with Q T is a bit speculative but okay.\n\nNow opponent bets small. Options: call, raise (maybe all-in), fold. Considering we are short stack, maybe we could shove all-in? But raise to 112 is still less than all-in. However, a raise to 112 might be seen as a semi-bluff, but we have a gutshot and backdoor flush; not strong enough to commit.\n\nOur equity vs opponent's range? Opponent likely has many combos that beat us: Aces (A?), K, maybe also draws. Our chance to improve on turn or river is limited: need J for straight (4 outs) plus maybe hearts for flush (2 more outs after turn). So about 6 outs total, ~12% per street. Not great.\n\nGiven we have 9 BB, we could consider a shove to try to double up. But we have only 148 chips, and opponent has 216, so we would be short-stack vs bigger stack. If we shove all-in (148) we risk losing our stack. But we need chips to survive.\n\nHowever, the bet is only 56, pot 144. If we call, we will have about 92 chips left (148-56). That leaves us with 5.75 BB, dangerously short. If we raise to 112 (i.e., add 56 more), we commit 112 total, leaving us 36 chips (2.25 BB). That's even worse.\n\nIf we fold, we preserve 148 but lose the chance to double up. But folding 56 into 144 when we have 9 BB may be okay if we think we are behind.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should go all-in to maximize fold equity. Our hand is not strong, but the opponent's small bet might be a probe; they may fold many weaker hands to an all-in. However, they have a big stack; they may call with many combos.\n\nBut we have Qh Ts, which has some showdown value if we hit straight or flush. But still low.\n\nI think best is to call, preserve chips? Actually calling leaves us with 92 chips, still short but we can try to see next card. If we call and miss, we may be forced to go all-in later.\n\nGiven we have only 6 outs, maybe better to fold and preserve stack for better spot. But folding 56 when we have 148 and 9 BB? That's 56/148 = 38% of stack. That's a big portion.\n\nConsidering tournament: short stack needs to find a spot to double up. Might be okay",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to output JSON with action, raise_to null if not raise, and reasoning. Determine best action.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe go all-in (raise to 148). But raise_to must be total amount we put in, not additional. We have 148 total stack, but we already have 32 preflop committed? Actually our stack after preflop raise 32: we put 32 into pot, leaving 148-32=116 chips left? Wait initial stack 148 includes the raise? Usually stack shown is total chips before action? It says \"Your Stack: 148 chips (9.2 BB)\". That's current stack before flop action? After preflop raise of 32, our stack would be 148 - 32 = 116. But the representation may be after preflop? Usually stack shown is current stack after preflop? Not sure. But pot is 144 includes our raise. So likely our stack is 148 after preflop? Actually pot: blinds 8+16=24, plus our raise 32 (so we added 16 extra?), opponent called 16, so pot after preflop: 8+16+16+32 = 72? Wait compute: SB 8, BB 16, MiniMax called 16, we raised to 32, then they called 16 more? Actually raise to 32 means we put 32, they call 16 additional (since they already put 16 blind). So total contributions: SB 8, BB 16, MiniMax 16 (call) + 16 (call to raise) = 32, we 32. So total pot = 8+16+32+32 = 88. But pot shown is 144 after flop bet of 56. So preflop pot was 144-56 = 88, matches. So our stack after preflop is 148 - 32 = 116. So we have 116 remaining. The amount to call is 56, which would leave us with 60 chips after call. So we can raise to 112 (i.e., total contribution of 112 from us). Since we already have 32 in, raising to 112 means we add 80 more, total contribution 112, leaving 148-112 = 36. So we could also go all-in: raise to 148 (i.e., all-in). But legal actions list only fold, call, raise. Raise to 112 is min raise, but we could raise more up to all-in? Usually allowed. So we could raise to 148.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should go all-in to maximize fold equity. Reason: we are short, need to double up, we have some outs and backdoor flush, and opponent's bet is small, could fold many hands.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 148.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

In Hand #13, they raised to 4 preflop again\n\nSo MiniMax-M2 has made this exact raise (4 chips) twice now in recent hands. This suggests they might be using a standard opening size, possibly with a wide range of hands.\n\nHowever, with 3h 7h in the BB facing a min-raise:\n- This is a very weak hand (3 and 7 offsuit)\n- We're getting 5:1 pot odds (calling 2 to win 10)\n- We're out of position against the raiser\n- Even with good pot odds, this hand has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range\n- We have a healthy stack of 91 BB\n- No need to defend with such a weak hand\n\nThe pot odds are decent (5:1), but the hand is just too weak.

Reasons:\n1. J8o is a weak hand, especially from UTG position\n2. I have 3 players behind me who can act (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, and Kimi-K2 Thinking)\n3. Both MiniMax-M2 and GPT-OSS-120B have shown they will raise preflop\n4. Even if I call the 2 chips, I'll be out of position postflop against potentially multiple opponents\n5. The hand doesn't have good implied odds - it's not suited, not connected well\n6. Tournament strategy: preserve stack and wait for better spots\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a stronger hand in better position.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have Ks Tc (King high, suited). In SB, after BB posted 2, UTG (seat4) raised to 4 (i.e., 2 raise). So we need to call 3 to see flop. Stack 225, 112.5 BB. Position: SB, out of position postflop. Hand is decent but not premium. Kc Tc suited is a suited broadway, can make straights, flushes. In early stage tournament, with 112 BB, you can be a bit aggressive but still consider fold vs raise.\n\nOpponent seat4: MiniMax-M2. We don't know tendencies. Could be random. Might be a raise from early position? Actually seat4 is MP? Table seats: seat1 is Kimi-K2 (BB). seat2 folded, seat3 folded, seat4 raise. So seat4 is UTG? Actually seat5 is SB, seat1 BB, seat4 is CO? Wait seats: 1 BB, 2 UTG? But seat numbers not important. But seat4 raising from middle position maybe. Since it's a 5-player? Actually we have seats 1-5, but seats 2 and 3 folded, leaving 3 players: seat4, seat5 (us), seat1 (BB). So seat4 raised from CO (cutoff) or maybe UTG? In any case, raise of 4 is small (2x big blind). So it's a standard opening.\n\nOur hand Kc Tc suited is a decent open-raising hand but we are out of position. Calling is okay to see flop, but could also 3-bet? But we have limited stack but still deep. 3-bet to maybe 12? Might be too aggressive against unknown. Since raise is small, could just call and see flop.\n\nPot odds: need to call 3 into pot 7+? Actually pot before action is 7 (SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 4? Actually raise 4 includes the 2 big blind? The raise to 4 means total bet is 4, so pot now: 1+2+4 =7. To call need 3 more, pot after call would be 10. So pot odds ~3/10 = 30% needed. Hand equity vs random? Kc Tc suited vs unknown range maybe ~20%? So maybe not profitable call.\n\nBut we can consider 3-bet as a bluff/ value. However with 112 BB we can afford to fold marginal hands. I'd lean to fold.\n\nBut we might also consider that opponent's raise could be wide, and we have decent suited connectors. Could call and try to flop. However we are out of position and have many players left. In tournament, preserving stack is important.\n\nThus I think fold.\n\nLet's produce JSON.",

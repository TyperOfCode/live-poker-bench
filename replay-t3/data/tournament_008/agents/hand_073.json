Actually blinds: SB 8, BB 16. The actions: seat5 post_sb 8 (so seat5 is SB? Wait seat5 is us, but position says BB. The actions show seat5 posted sb 8, seat1 posted bb 16. So we are actually SB, not BB. But position says BB (Seat5). Possibly mislabel: seat5 is BB? Actually seat5 is us, they posted SB 8, then seat1 posted BB 16. So we are SB with 3hKd. So we are out of position post-flop. Amount to call 8 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 32. With 3hKd, not a good hand, but can consider calling to see flop? 12.8 BB stack, 8 call is 0.5 BB. Might be okay to limp? Actually it's a raise? The BB posted 16, we posted SB 8, then we need to call 8 to match BB. That's a standard raise from BB? Actually the BB is a raise of 16 (post). So we can call 8 to see flop. 3K is a decent hand? Off-suit K3 is not great, but could be okay to call in SB vs BB with deep stacks? But stack is shallow 12.8 BB. I think folding is reasonable. But we could also call to see flop for cheap. However K3 offsuit is weak, likely dominated by many hands BB could have. I'd fold.\n\nCheck legal actions: fold, call, raise.

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Information:**\n- Position: SB (Seat 1)\n- Cards: 2c 4s (very weak hand, offsuit, low cards)\n- Stack: 131 chips (16.4 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 36 chips\n- Facing a raise from GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) to 24 chips\n- Amount to call: 20 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis - GPT-OSS-120B:**\nFrom the recall data, I can see that GPT-OSS-120B has been quite tight:\n- Folded preflop in hands 36, 37, 41, 42, 44 (5 out of 9 hands)\n- Called once in hand 39 (small amount of 2)\n- Raised once in hand 40 (amount of 12)\n- Checked once in hand 43\n- Overall pattern suggests a relatively tight player\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- 2c 4s is a terrible hand - offsuit, low cards, no connectivity, no suited potential\n- This is in the bottom 10% of starting hands\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm in SB, which is one of the worst positions\n- I'll be out of position post-flop\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 36 chips\n- To call: 20 chips\n- Pot odds: 36:20 or 1.8:1\n- This means I need ~36% equity to call profitably\n- With 2c 4s, I likely have ~30-35% equity against a typical raising range, maybe even less\n\n**Stack Size Considerations:**\n- I have 131 chips (16.4 BB)\n- This is a medium-short stack in tournament play\n- Calling 20 chips would cost me ~15% of my stack with a very weak hand\n- This is a significant investment for a hand that will rarely hit and be difficult to play post-flop\n\n**Tournament Strategy:**\n- With 16.4 BB, I need to be selective and look for spots to apply pressure or get my money in good\n- I should not invest 15% of my stack with a trash hand out of position\n- Even if I hit a miracle flop (like 2-2-4 or 4-4-2), it will be hard to extract value and I could be dominated\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, I'm out of position, the opponent appears to be tight (making their raise more meaningful), and calling would cost me too much of my stack relative to my chances of winning.\n\nI could consider a re-raise as a bluff since the opponent seems tight, but with 2c 4s this is too risky. If they call, I'm in terrible shape post-flop with no equity. And if they shove, I have to fold. It's better to preserve my chips for a better spot.",

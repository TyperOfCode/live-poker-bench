The blinds are 32/64.\n\nLet me analyze my situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A\u26663\u2666 is a weak ace with a suited kicker. From UTG, this is a very marginal hand, especially with a short stack.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. I have to act without any information about what other players will do.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 282 chips, which is only 4.4 BB. This is a very short stack in a tournament situation. With a stack this short, I need to be thinking about survival and finding good spots to get my money in.\n\n4. **Opponents**: Looking at the recent actions:\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 88 chips and seems to fold frequently\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 198 chips and has shown aggression (raised 166 in hand 102)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has only 16 chips and is very short\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 4.4 BB, I'm in critical territory. I need to preserve my stack and look for better opportunities. A\u26663\u2666 from UTG is not a good hand to risk my tournament life on.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I have to call 64 chips to win 96, which is 1.5:1 pot odds. But this is misleading because:\n   - I'm out of position\n   - A3 suited plays poorly against calling ranges\n   - If I hit an ace, I'm often dominated by better aces\n   - If I hit my flush draw, I may not have enough chips to realize the equity\n\n7. **Action**: Folding is the clear choice here. I should wait for a better spot - either a better hand or a better position. With such a short stack, I want to be the one shoving, not calling off a significant portion of my stack with a marginal hand from early position.\n\nThe only consideration might be that the players behind me have shown some folding tendencies, but GPT-OSS-120B has also shown aggression. Even if they all fold and I steal the blinds, I'm only adding 96 chips to my 282, which doesn't fundamentally change my situation. And if I get called, I'm in bad shape.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

            "content": "Now I have some useful information about Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). Looking at their actions, I can see:\n\n1. They have a pattern of calling preflop with various amounts - from 1 to 133 chips\n2. Looking at their showdown hands, I can see they called with:\n   - AdJs (hand 69)\n   - 7d8d (hand 81) - this is similar to my 9h8d, both are suited connectors\n   - Th8s (hand 92) - another similar hand\n   - 2cJh (hand 96)\n   - 2dKc (hand 100)\n\nThis shows they're willing to call with a wide range of hands, including medium-strength suited connectors like 78s and T8s. My 98s is in a similar category.\n\nHowever, I need to be very careful here. I'm in the small blind with only 1.4 BB, and I have 98s. The big blind is 64, I've already posted 32, so I need to call 32 more to see the flop.\n\nLet me think about the math:\n- Pot is 112 chips (32 from me, 64 from BB, 16 from Seat 2)\n- I need to call 32 to win 112 = 3.5:1 pot odds\n- With 98s, I have decent playability and potential for straights and flushes\n- I'm getting good pot odds for a speculative hand\n\nBut the key issue is my stack size. With only 88 chips total, calling 32 represents 36% of my stack. If I miss the flop (which I will most of the time), I'll be left with only 56 chips and will be forced to fold to any bet.\n\nThis is a classic short-stack decision. With 1.4 BB, I should generally be looking to either go all-in or fold preflop. \n\nI'll evaluate the hand's strength in this specific context. 98s has decent potential, especially in a multi-way pot with good implied odds. The suited connectors offer opportunities for straights and flushes that could pay off significantly. However, the low stack size means I can't afford to see multiple streets without committing to the hand completely. The calling range of my opponent suggests they play loosely, which could work in my favor if I can get to the flop cheaply and hit big.\n\nThe critical factor is preserving my tournament life. With only 88 chips, every decision becomes crucial. I need to balance the potential payoff against the risk of elimination. In this situation, going all-in might be the most aggressive and potentially rewarding strategy, forcing opponents into difficult decisions with my marginal hand.\n\nThe pot odds are compelling - 112 chips already in the pot, requiring just 32 more to see the flop. This represents an attractive 3.5:1 return if I can connect. My 98s has decent playability, offering multiple drawing opportunities and potential straight and flush combinations.\n\nHowever, the stack size introduces significant complexity. Calling commits a substantial portion of my chips, potentially leaving me vulnerable if I miss the flop. The tournament implications demand careful consideration of my long-term survival strategy.\n\nUltimately, the math suggests folding might be the most prudent choice. The marginal hand strength, combined with the risk of depleting my stack, tips the decision toward preservation over speculative play. I need to be disciplined and recognize when the potential reward doesn't justify the substantial risk to my tournament existence.\n\nThe key factors are clear: my stack size is critically low, the hand has limited potential, and the implied odds don't compensate for the significant risk of elimination. A conservative approach demands folding and waiting for a more favorable situation.\n\nThe tournament context amplifies the importance of chip preservation. With only 88 chips, every decision carries outsized weight, and speculative plays become increasingly dangerous. My goal shifts from aggressive play to strategic survival, recognizing that maintaining tournament life is more valuable than chasing marginal hands.\n\nThe mathematical reality is stark: calling commits a substantial portion of my stack, leaving minimal room for maneuverability. This constraint essentially transforms the decision into an implicit all-in, where the potential upside doesn't justify the substantial downside risk of elimination.\n\nI'm now carefully evaluating the strategic implications of my 9h8d hand. The suited connectors offer some potential for straight and flush combinations, but the current stack dynamics severely limit my options. With only 88 chips, I'm essentially forced into a high-risk, low-reward scenario where preserving tournament life takes precedence over speculative plays.\n\nThe pot odds present an interesting mathematical perspective. At 3.5:1, the potential return seems tempting, yet the underlying risk remains significant. My decision ultimately hinges on balancing the theoretical payoff against the very real possibility of tournament elimination.\n\nI'm analyzing the hand's potential through multiple lenses: stack preservation, implied odds, and the specific characteristics of 9h8d. The suited connectors provide some flexibility, but the current chip count constrains"

Going all-in now could pressure both opponents, potentially winning the pot immediately or setting up a favorable post-flop scenario. The suited connectors offer enough potential to make this a reasonable move, especially considering my short stack position.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "Now I have some useful information about Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). Looking at their actions, I can see:\n\n1. They have a pattern of calling preflop with various amounts - from 1 to 133 chips\n2. Looking at their showdown hands, I can see they called with:\n   - AdJs (hand 69)\n   - 7d8d (hand 81) - this is similar to my 9h8d, both are suited connectors\n   - Th8s (hand 92) - another similar hand\n   - 2cJh (hand 96)\n   - 2dKc (hand 100)\n\nThis shows they're willing to call with a wide range of hands, including medium-strength suited connectors like 78s and T8s. My 98s is in a similar category.\n\nHowever, I need to be very careful here. I'm in the small blind with only 1.4 BB, and I have 98s. The big blind is 64, I've already posted 32, so I need to call 32 more to see the flop.\n\nLet me think about the math:\n- Pot is 112 chips (32 from me, 64 from BB, 16 from Seat 2)\n- I need to call 32 to win 112 = 3.5:1 pot odds\n- With 98s, I have decent playability and potential for straights and flushes\n- I'm getting good pot odds for a speculative hand\n\nBut the key issue is my stack size. With only 88 chips total, calling 32 represents 36% of my stack. If I miss the flop (which I will most of the time), I'll be left with only 56 chips and will be forced to fold to any bet.\n\nThis is a classic short-stack decision. With 1.4 BB, I should generally be looking to either go all-in or fold preflop. \n\nI'll evaluate the hand's strength in this specific context. 98s has decent potential, especially in a multi-way pot with good implied odds. The suited connectors offer opportunities for straights and flushes that could pay off significantly. However, the low stack size means I can't afford to see multiple streets without committing to the hand completely. The calling range of my opponent suggests they play loosely, which could work in my favor if I can get to the flop cheaply and hit big.\n\nThe critical factor is preserving my tournament life. With only 88 chips, every decision becomes crucial. I need to balance the potential payoff against the risk of elimination. In this situation, going all-in might be the most aggressive and potentially rewarding strategy, forcing opponents into difficult decisions with my marginal hand.\n\nThe pot odds are compelling - 112 chips already in the pot, requiring just 32 more to see the flop. This represents an attractive 3.5:1 return if I can connect. My 98s has decent playability, offering multiple drawing opportunities and potential straight and flush combinations.\n\nHowever, the stack size introduces significant complexity. Calling commits a substantial portion of my chips, potentially leaving me vulnerable if I miss the flop. The tournament implications demand careful consideration of my long-term survival strategy.\n\nUltimately, the math suggests folding might be the most prudent choice. The marginal hand strength, combined with the risk of depleting my stack, tips the decision toward preservation over speculative play. I need to be disciplined and recognize when the potential reward doesn't justify the substantial risk to my tournament existence.\n\nThe key factors are clear: my stack size is critically low, the hand has limited potential, and the implied odds don't compensate for the significant risk of elimination. A conservative approach demands folding and waiting for a more favorable situation.\n\nThe tournament context amplifies the importance of chip preservation. With only 88 chips, every decision carries outsized weight, and speculative plays become increasingly dangerous. My goal shifts from aggressive play to strategic survival, recognizing that maintaining tournament life is more valuable than chasing marginal hands.\n\nThe mathematical reality is stark: calling commits a substantial portion of my stack, leaving minimal room for maneuverability. This constraint essentially transforms the decision into an implicit all-in, where the potential upside doesn't justify the substantial downside risk of elimination.\n\nI'm now carefully evaluating the strategic implications of my 9h8d hand. The suited connectors offer some potential for straight and flush combinations, but the current stack dynamics severely limit my options. With only 88 chips, I'm essentially forced into a high-risk, low-reward scenario where preserving tournament life takes precedence over speculative plays.\n\nThe pot odds present an interesting mathematical perspective. At 3.5:1, the potential return seems tempting, yet the underlying risk remains significant. My decision ultimately hinges on balancing the theoretical payoff against the very real possibility of tournament elimination.\n\nI'm analyzing the hand's potential through multiple lenses: stack preservation, implied odds, and the specific characteristics of 9h8d. The suited connectors provide some flexibility, but the current chip count constrains",

In that case, I'd essentially be committed to seeing the flop anyway since I'd be too short to fold to any reasonable bet.\n\nSo this is really a decision between:\n1. Fold and keep 56 chips\n2.

This is a hand that can make strong draws and can win big pots when it hits.\n\nHowever, I'm also considering tournament survival. With only 88 chips, I'm already in the danger zone.\n\nBut mathematically, 98s has decent equity, and I'm getting good pot odds. \n\nThe tournament dynamics suggest a more aggressive approach. With such a short stack, I need to maximize my chances of survival. Calling commits me to the hand, leaving minimal room for maneuverability. The pot odds provide a slight mathematical edge, but the risk of elimination looms large. I'll call, knowing I'm essentially committed to seeing the full board with my 98s.\n",

            "content": "Looking at this situation, I have 9h 8d on a board showing 9s 7c 2c, giving me a pair of 9s but with a weak kicker. My stack is critically short at just 56 chips (0.9 BB), which means I'm essentially one bet away from elimination.\n\nFrom my opponent GPT-OSS-120B's history, I can see they have a mixed strategy - sometimes aggressive with raises (186, 166 chips) but also capable of passive play with checks and folds. This makes them unpredictable.\n\nGiven my extremely short stack and the fact that the minimum raise (64 chips) would be more than my entire stack, I need to be very careful. With a pair of 9s but a weak kicker, I'm not strong enough to commit more chips, but I'm also not weak enough to immediately fold.\n\nThe pot is already 144 chips, so checking to see the turn card is reasonable. If I catch a good card on the turn, I can reassess, and if not, I can fold to any aggression. This preserves my tournament life while keeping me in the hand with some equity.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"With a pair of 9s but weak kicker and critically short stack (56 chips), checking preserves my tournament life while keeping me in the hand.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation carefully:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in the Small Blind (Seat 4) with 9h 8d\n- My stack: 56 chips (0.9 BB - very short stacked)\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 144 chips\n- Board: 9s 7c 2c\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) with 198 chips\n\n**Preflop Actions:**\n- I posted SB (32)\n- GPT-OSS-120B posted BB (64)\n- Seat 1 folded\n- Seat 2 called 16\n- I called 32\n- GPT-OSS-120B checked\n\n**Current Decision:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (since GPT checked)\n- Minimum raise to: 64\n- Legal actions: fold, check\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have 9h 8d, and the board shows 9s 7c 2c. This gives me:\n- A pair of 9s (one in my hand, one on board)\n- Possible straight draws (6-7-8-9 or 8-9-10-J)\n- Low kicker with the 8\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see:\n- Hand #97: called preflop, then folded\n- Hand #98: folded preflop\n- Hand #99: raised 186 preflop (aggressive)\n- Hand #100: checked preflop and flop, bet 32 on turn\n- Hand #101: folded preflop\n- Hand #102: raised 166 preflop (aggressive)\n- Hand #103: folded preflop\n\nThe opponent seems to have a mixed strategy - sometimes aggressive (raising 186, 166), sometimes passive (checking, folding).\n\n\n\nI'm facing a critical decision with my short stack. With only 56 chips and a minimum raise of 64, I can't even make a standard raise. My pair of 9s feels weak, and the board doesn't offer much protection. The opponent's unpredictable style adds complexity. Checking seems the safest option to potentially see the turn card without committing more chips. A fold would prematurely end my hand with a decent pair.\n\nThe pot odds suggest some merit in continuing, but my weak kicker and limited stack make this a challenging spot. I'll likely need a very strong improvement on the turn to feel confident about my hand.\n\nGiven my short stack and the board texture, checking is the most prudent move. I'm hoping to catch a free card that might improve my hand, while avoiding unnecessary chip investment in a marginal situation.\n\nThe key considerations are my low stack size, the pair I've made, and the potential for my opponent to have a stronger hand. By checking, I minimize risk while keeping the possibility of seeing the next card alive.\n\nMy stack is critically low - essentially one bet away from elimination. This forces a conservative approach, prioritizing survival over aggressive play. With 9-8 suited, I'm looking for maximum value with minimal risk.\n\nThe board offers some interesting dynamics: paired 9s could potentially give me some equity, but I'm vulnerable to stronger hands. My kicker is weak, which limits my confidence in the hand's potential.\n\nChecking preserves my tournament life and keeps me in the game, avoiding unnecessary chip expenditure. If the turn brings improvement, I can reassess my strategy.\n",

Actually seat 4 posted sb 32, then called 32? That seems they called the big blind? So they have 56 stack, they are short. We have 198 chips, 3.1 BB. Minimum raise is 128 (i.e., raise to 128 total). That would be a raise of 64 (since BB is 64). But we have short stack opponent; we might want to go all-in to extract value. All-in amount would be 198 (our whole stack). But can we raise to that? Minimum raise is 128, we can raise to any amount up to our stack? Usually yes, we can raise all-in. Should we? With AA, it's best to max value. Opponent has 56 chips, they are already in for 32 (call). If we raise all-in, they may call or fold. But they might be forced to call all-in? Actually they have 56 chips total, they already posted 32 (sb) and called 32 (so they have 56 left? Wait they had 56 total chips, posted 32 sb, then call 32 to match BB? That uses all 56. So they are all-in already! Indeed they posted sb 32, then call 32 (i.e., they match the BB 64 total). So they are all-in for 56 total (but they have no chips left). So the pot is now: BB 64, SB 32, plus their call 32? Actually the pot: BB 64, SB 32, plus seat2 call 16? Not relevant. The amount to call is 0. So we are in a situation where opponent is all-in for 56 chips. We have AA. We can check (i.e., call the all-in) which is effectively winning the pot. So best is to check (call) to win the pot.

            "reasoning_content": "We have BB with AA, stack 198, pot 144 after flop. Opponent MiniMax-M2 (Seat4) checked. It's a very strong hand, but we are short stacked (3.1 BB). We want to maximize value but also consider risk of being called by worse hand. With AA vs unknown range (likely some weak hand, maybe draws). We could check to see a free card, but risk giving free turn card that could improve opponent. Better to bet for value. Minimum raise to 64, that would be raise to 64 total (i.e., bet 64). That would be about half pot (pot 144, bet 64 makes pot 208). Opponent has 56 chips left, less than raise amount, so if we raise to 64, it's more than his stack; he could only call all-in 56? Actually raise to 64 means we put total 64 chips into pot (including our existing 64 blind?). Wait we are in BB, we posted 64. The pot is 144 includes our 64, opponent's 32 call, seat2 call 16, seat1 fold, seat4 call 32? Let's compute: Preflop: seat4 post sb 32, seat5 post bb 64, seat1 fold, seat2 call 16 (maybe small blind?), seat4 call 32 (call to BB), seat5 check (BB). So preflop pot: 32+64+16+32 = 144. Yes.\n\nNow flop: seat4 check, amount to call 0. Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., bet 64). But opponent only has 56 chips left, less than 64, so we can raise all-in for 56 (or raise to 64 which would be more than his stack, effectively all-in). We need to see legal actions: raise is allowed. So we should raise all-in (i.e., raise to 198 total? Actually we have 198 total stack, we have already 64 in pot, remaining 134. Opponent has 56. Minimum raise to 64 means total bet of 64 (including our previous 64?), but we have already contributed 64 preflop, but that counts to our stack? Usually raise amount is additional chips beyond call. But the spec says raise_to is total amount you're putting in. So raise_to 64 would be total contribution after raise? That seems ambiguous. Usually raise to 64 means total bet of 64, but we already have 64 in pot, so raise to 64 is just check? Actually amount to call is 0, so a raise to 64 would be putting 64 more chips, total contribution 128. That would exceed opponent's stack. So we could raise to 120 (all-in). But legal actions minimum raise to 64 indicates you must bet at least 64 more? That's typical: minimum raise = big blind amount = 64. So we could raise to 64 more, i.e., total 128, but opponent only has 56 left, so they'd be forced all-in for 56. That's fine.\n\nThus we should raise (all-in) to maximize value. Reason: AA is nuts, short stack, need chips, opponent may call with any pair or draw. So raise all-in.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to maybe 120? But we need to follow spec: raise_to total amount we are putting in. Our total stack is 198, we already have 64 in pot, remaining 134. If we go all-in, total contribution becomes 64+134=198. So raise_to 198. That is allowed? Minimum raise is 64, we can raise more. So raise_to 198.\n\nReturn JSON.",

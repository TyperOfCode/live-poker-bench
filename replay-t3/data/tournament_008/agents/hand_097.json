            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN with Jc Th (Jack of clubs, Ten of hearts)\n- Stack: 242 chips (7.6 BB) - very short stacked\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- Opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) in SB position has called 16 (so they limped)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nJTs is a decent suited connector. From the BTN, it's a good hand to play, especially in a heads-up situation. It has good potential for straights and flushes.\n\n**Position & Stack:**\n- I'm on the BTN (best position)\n- I have a very short stack of only 7.6 BB\n- This is a critical stack size - I need to be looking for spots to shove or fold\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B):**\nLooking at their recent actions:\n- Very passive player - lots of folds and checks\n- They limped from SB this hand (called 16)\n- In hand 96, they checked down all streets\n- In hand 94, they raised to 64 then folded\n- In hand 86, they raised to 165 (probably all-in or close to it)\n- In hand 92, they called 133\n\nThis player seems passive and tends to fold to aggression. They limped from SB, which suggests weakness.\n\n**Decision:**\nWith a short stack of 7.6 BB and JTs on the BTN against a limper, this is a clear shove spot. \n\n1. **Fold equity**: Against a passive player who limps, I likely have good fold equity\n2. **Hand equity**: JTs has good equity against a typical limping range\n3. **Stack size**: At 7.6 BB, I need to accumulate chips or get eliminated\n4. **Position**: Being on the BTN is advantageous\n\nThe minimum raise is 64, but with my stack of 242, I should just shove all-in for 242. This puts maximum pressure on the opponent and gives me two ways to win: they fold, or they call and I have decent equity.\n\n\nI'll go all-in with my 242-chip stack, leveraging my position and the opponent's passive tendencies. This aggressive move maximizes my chances of either winning the pot immediately or having solid equity if called.",

So we are in BB, facing a raise? Actually actions: seat5 post_sb 16 (small blind?), seat1 post_bb 32 (big blind). Wait seat numbers: seat5 is us, but they posted SB? Usually SB is seat left of dealer. But they said Position: BB (Seat5). Yet actions show seat5 post_sb 16 (small blind) and seat1 post_bb 32 (big blind). So maybe the dealer is seat? Anyway we are in BB but we posted SB? Might be confusion. But amount to call is 16, meaning we need to call 16 to match the big blind? Actually big blind is 32, we posted small blind 16, so we need to call 16 more to complete the BB. So no raise yet. So we can call 16 (complete blind) or raise min 64 (to total 64). With 6c5s, a weak suited connector, short stack 6 BB. Should we call? In tournament early, we want to preserve chips but also maybe steal. 6c5s is not a good hand to call blind with. However we are already half blind; we could just call and see flop, but with 6 BB, maybe we want to raise to try to steal? But min raise to 64 total (i.e., raise 48 more). That's 2 BB raise (actually 64 total includes our 16 already posted? Not sure). So raise to 64 would be 48 more, making total bet 64. That's 2 BB raise. With 6c5s, not a good raise. Better to just call and see flop, maybe fold if nothing. But we are short stack, need to double up. However raising with 6c5s is low chance to win. So call.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 6c5s, short stack 5.8 BB. Opponent seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 242 after we called small blind? Wait: blinds: small blind 16 (seat5), big blind 32 (seat1). Actually seat5 is SB? Wait position: BB seat5, but actions show seat5 post_sb 16, seat1 post_bb 32. So seat5 is small blind, seat1 is big blind. Then seat5 call 16 (completes SB) and seat1 raise 242 (from BB). So we are in SB? Actually seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. So we are SB with 6c5s, stack 186. After posting 16, we called 16 (so we are now at 0? Actually we posted SB 16, then call 16 to match BB? Wait we called 16 more to match BB's 32? Actually after SB, we need to call 16 more to match BB. So we have contributed total 32. Then BB raises to 242 (i.e., total bet 242). So amount to call is 210 (242-32). Minimum raise to 452. Legal actions: fold, call. So we cannot raise because our stack 186 is less than min raise? Actually we have 186 total stack before posting SB? Stack 186 includes the SB posted? Usually stack includes chips before posting. We posted 16, now remaining 170. To call 210 we need 210 more, but we only have 170. So we cannot call full amount; we can go all-in for remaining 170, which would be a call all-in (less than amount to call). Is that allowed? In poker, you can go all-in for less than bet, it's considered a call. So legal action includes call (meaning you can call all-in). So we can call all-in of 170 (i.e., go all-in). Decision: With 6c5s, short stack, facing a raise from BB (who is presumably a short stack too? Actually seat1 has 32 chips, but that's their stack after posting BB? Actually seat1 stack is 32 chips total? That seems they are also short. They have only 32 chips left (i.e., they are on the brink). So they raise to 242, but they only have 32? Something off. The stack numbers: seat1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 32 chips (maybe that's their stack after posting BB?). So they have 32 chips total, posted BB 32, they have no remaining chips. How can they raise? Actually they can't raise beyond their stack; maybe the numbers are misaligned: The \"players at table\" shows chip counts before posting blinds? Usually you list current stack before posting. So seat1 has 32 chips total, posted BB 32, now they have 0 left, but they raise to 242? That is impossible. Something off. Possibly the chip counts are after posting blinds? Or maybe the numbers are just placeholders. We need to decide action.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, 6-5 unsuited, short stack, and facing a raise from BB (who may be a short stack, but raising big). Likely we should fold. The raise is 242, which is huge relative to pot (274). Our hand has low equity. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON with fold.\n\n",

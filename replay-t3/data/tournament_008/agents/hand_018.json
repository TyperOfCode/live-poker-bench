However, I'm on the button, which is the best position, and both players who have acted are already folded. The only players left are the small blind (MiniMax-M2) and big blind (GPT-OSS-120B).\n\nLooking at the recall data:\n- MiniMax-M2 has raised preflop 3 times (hands 11, 13, 14) - seems to be somewhat aggressive\n- GPT-OSS-120B has also raised preflop 3 times (hands 10, 15, 17) - also aggressive\n- My own history shows I've folded a lot (14 folds out of 17 hands, win rate 11.8%)\n\nThe pot is 3 chips (SB 1 + BB 2). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop. My stack is 173 chips (86.5 BB).\n\nWith 9-5 offsuit, this is a trash hand. However, being on the button against just the blinds, sometimes players might try to steal with weak hands. But 9-5o is really bad - no connectedness, no suitedness, low cards.\n\nThe blinds are 1/2, so calling 2 chips is 1 BB. Pot odds: I need to call 2 to win 3, so I need ~40% equity. I definitely don't have 40% equity against random hands.\n\nIf I raise, minimum raise is to 4 total (2 more). But raising with this hand is too ambitious.\n\nGiven my position, I could consider a steal attempt, but:\n1. Both blinds have shown aggression\n2. My hand is terrible\n3. I have a healthy stack (86.5 BB)\n4. Better to wait for a better spot\n\nI should fold. No reason to play this hand. Even if I call and see a flop, I'll often miss completely or have a weak pair that's hard to play.\n\nTournament considerations: Preserve stack, wait for better opportunities. My win rate is low (11.8%), so I need to be selective.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

The user said my response was invalid, so let me check what went wrong. Looking at my previous response, I used \"bet\" as the action, but the legal actions listed are \"fold, check, raise\". So I should use \"raise\" instead of \"bet\" since I'm making a bet.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. When I bet, I'm raising the current bet amount from 0 to some positive number. So I should use \"raise\" as the action.\n\nFor the amount to raise to, since the current pot is 4 chips and there's no bet to call, I need to make a bet.

With 6-6, raise to maybe 6-8 to isolate and get value from overpairs? But also could just check and try to hit set. In BB, checking is common for small pairs to see flop cheap.

Pocket pair low, board is paired high cards? Actually board has K and A, no pair on board. We have underpair, no draws. Opponent bet 3, maybe continuation bet. Could be trying to steal, could have a hand like Kx, Ax, 8x, maybe a draw? No flush draws (two spades? board has K\u2660, A\u2660, we have 6h6d, opponent unknown). There is potential for straight draws? Board K,8,A: no straight possibilities yet. So opponent likely has strong hand or is bluffing. With underpair, we likely fold. But need consider stack sizes and tournament stage: we have 111 BB, deep. Opponent bet small 3 into 7 pot, could be a float or a weak hand. But calling 3 for a pot of 10 gives pot odds 3/(10+3)=3/13 ~23% needed. Our hand equity vs random hand is low (<20%). So folding is correct.\n\nCheck if any reason to call? Perhaps if opponent is very tight and only bets with strong, then we fold. If opponent is aggressive and often bets with nothing, maybe call to see turn. But we have no outs beyond hitting a six on turn/river. Probability to improve to set: remaining two sixes in deck, 47 unknown cards, chance on turn ~2/47=4.3%, on river if miss turn ~2/46=4.3% again. So low.

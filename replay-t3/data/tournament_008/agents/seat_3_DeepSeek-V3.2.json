It plays well multi-way but I'm facing a raise from early position (seat 2 appears to be UTG+1 or MP).\n\nOpponent tendencies: From the limited data, seat 2 folded preflop in hand #1. No other data on their raising range.\n\nPot odds: Pot is currently 9 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise). I need to call 5 chips, so I'm getting 9:5 or 1.8:1 pot odds (35.7% equity needed). JTs against a reasonable UTG raising range (say top 15%: 77+, A9s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KQo) has about 38% equity, which is slightly above the break-even point.\n\nHowever, position is terrible. I'll be out of position for the entire hand, which significantly reduces my implied odds and makes the hand harder to play.\n\nTournament considerations: Early in tournament with deep stacks (100 BB). No need to take marginal spots out of position.\n\nBetter to fold here and wait for better spots, especially in better position.

I have to act after SB (MiniMax-M2) posted 1 and BB (GPT-OSS-120B) posted 2. Amount to call is 2.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand Strength**: A8o is a marginal hand from early positions but much more playable from the button. Having an Ace is good, but 8 is a weak kicker. This is a steal opportunity from the button.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is huge advantage - I get to act last on every subsequent street.\n3. **Opponents**: SB (MiniMax-M2) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B) - I don't have much history on them. In hand #1, MiniMax-M2 folded from BB with 99 (pocket nines) when facing no action, which seems tight. In hand #2, they folded from SB after a raise. GPT-OSS-120B folded from BB in hand #1 and folded from UTG in hand #2.\n4. **Stack Sizes**: Everyone has similar stacks (197-202 chips). No short stacks.\n5. **Tournament**: Early stage with 100 BB stacks. Can be more aggressive with position.\n\n**Options**:\n- **Fold**: Too tight. Giving up the button with A8o when everyone folded to me is too passive.\n- **Call**: Just calling 2 to see a flop. Okay option but doesn't put pressure on blinds.\n- **Raise**: Best option. Standard button raise to 4-6 BB (8-12 chips). I should raise to take initiative and potentially win the blinds.\n\nGiven the information, I should make a standard button raise. Let's raise to 10 chips (5x BB), which is a reasonable size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 10,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A8o is playable from the button with everyone folded.

The flop is 3\u26607\u26637\u2660. The opponent bets 15 into a pot of 36. I need to call 15 to win a pot of 51 (36+15). That's pot odds of 15/51 \u2248 29.4%.\n\nMy hand: Ace-high with backdoor flush draw (spades) and backdoor straight potential. The board is paired with 7s, which is concerning. The opponent could have a 7, a pocket pair, or be bluffing. Since I raised preflop, my range looks strong, but A8o is not a great hand on this board.\n\nThe opponent's bet is about 42% of the pot. This could be a probe bet with a weak hand, a value bet with a 7 or pocket pair, or a bluff. Without much history on this opponent (they folded their first two hands), it's hard to read tendencies.\n\nMy position is good (button), but my hand is weak. I have 190 chips total. Calling 15 would leave me with 175. If I call and miss turn, I could face another bet.\n\nBackdoor flush draw: I need runner-runner spades (turn and river both spades). That's about 4% chance. Backdoor straight: I need 6-9 or 9-J on turn and river, also low probability.\n\nGiven the pot odds of 29%, I need about 29% equity to call. Against a reasonable range, A8o on 3\u26607\u26637\u2660 probably has less than 29% equity. Even if opponent is bluffing with hands like 65, 54, etc., I'm only ahead of complete air.\n\nConsidering tournament implications: I have 95 BB, which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots. The paired board makes it less likely my Ace-high is good.\n\nHowever, I'm in position, which gives me some leverage. If I call, I can see a turn card and potentially take it away if opponent checks. But the bet size suggests strength.\n\nLet me think about raising. A raise to 30-40 could take it down now if opponent is bluffing. But if they have a 7 or pocket pair, they'll likely call or re-raise. My hand doesn't have much fold equity since I'm representing a narrow range (overpairs, 7x). Would opponent believe I have a 7 after raising preflop? Possibly A7s, 77, but those are rare.\n\nActually, wait. I should consider that I raised preflop from button. My range could include many hands. The opponent called from BB, so their range is wide. They could have many weak hands that missed this flop.\n\nThe flop is dry except for the pair. Many hands missed. My Ace-high might actually be the best hand if opponent has something like KQ, QJ, JT, T9, etc. But would they bet those? Possibly as a bluff.\n\nGiven the lack of history, I think folding is reasonable. But let me consider the pot odds more carefully. If I think I have 30% equity or more, I should call. Against a range of: all pairs 22-AA, all 7x, all Broadway cards, maybe I have around 25-30% equity. Hard to say.\n\nActually, I should call. Reasons: 1) Position advantage, 2) Ace-high could be best, 3) Backdoor draws, 4) Pot odds are decent, 5) If turn checks, I can bluff. 6) Opponent might be betting weak.\n\nBut the paired board is concerning. If opponent has any 7, I'm drawing nearly dead. If they have a pocket pair above 7, I'm behind. Only beating complete bluffs.\n\nI think I'll call and re-evaluate turn. If turn is an Ace, I improve. If turn is a spade, I get flush draw. If turn blanks, and opponent bets again, I can fold.\n\nActually, let me check: pot is 36, bet 15, call 15. Total pot after call: 51. I need 29% equity. Against a range of: all pocket pairs 22-AA, all 7x suited, A7s, K7s, Q7s, J7s, T7s, 97s, 87s, 76s, 75s, 74s, 73s, 72s, and some Broadway hands (maybe 20% of them as bluffs)... Let me estimate.\n\nActually, I think fold is better. The paired board reduces"

But many hands miss completely.\n\nMy A\u26638\u2660 has some showdown value if it's ace-high. The backdoor flush and straight draws add a little equity. Pot odds: 15 to win 51 (29.4%).

Good SPR for future streets.\n\nGiven this is early in tournament and I have 95 BB, I can afford to take a speculative call. Folding is too tight.

Turn is 6c (completing the board to 3s7c7s6c - wait, the board shows 3s 7c 7s 6c, so flop was 3s 7c 7s, turn is 6c). So board is paired 7s with straight draws possible (4-5-6-7-8 or 5-6-7-8-9). I have Ace high with backdoor flush draw (spades) and gutshot straight draw (I need a 5 for 4-5-6-7-8 straight? Actually with A-8, I have 4-5-6-7-8 straight if I hit a 5, or 5-6-7-8-9 if I hit a 9). Actually, board is 3s 7c 7s 6c. Straight possibilities: 4-5-6-7-8 (needs 4 and 5), 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 5, 8, 9). I have an 8, so I need 5 and 9 for straight? Let me think: With my A8, I have 8. Board has 3,7,7,6. Possible straights: 3-4-5-6-7 (needs 4,5), 4-5-6-7-8 (needs 4,5,8 - I have 8), 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 5,8,9 - I have 8), 6-7-8-9-T (needs 8,9,T - I have 8). So I have gutshot to straight if I hit a 5 (for 4-5-6-7-8) or 9 (for 5-6-7-8-9) or T (for 6-7-8-9-T). Actually, hitting a 5 gives me 4-5-6-7-8 straight (I have 8, board has 6,7,7,3, I'd need 4 and 5). Wait, that's two cards. Actually, with one card to come (river), I need a single card to complete a straight. What single card gives me a straight? Board: 3,6,7,7. My hand: A,8. Possible straights with one card: \n- 4 gives me 3-4-5-6-7? No, that's 3-4-5-6-7 but I have A,8 not 5.\n- 5 gives me 4-5-6-7-8? I have 8, board has 6,7,7,3. Need 4 and 5. Not one card.\n- 9 gives me 5-6-7-8-9? Need 5,6,7,8,9. I have 8, board has 6,7,7,3. Need 5 and 9. Not one card.\n- T gives me 6-7-8-9-T? Need 6,7,8,9,T. I have 8, board has 6,7,7,3. Need 9 and T.\n\nSo actually, I don't have a straight draw with one card to come. I have Ace high with backdoor flush draw (spades). I need a spade on river for flush draw? Actually, board has 3s and 7s, I have Ac8s, so I have two spades, board has two spades, so I need one more spade for flush. That's 9 outs (13 spades total - 2 on board - 2 in my hand = 9, but some might be dead). Approximately 9 outs, ~18% chance.\n\nOpponent bet 30 into pot of 81. Pot is now 81+30 = 111, I need to call 30, so pot odds are 30/141 = ~21% (actually 30/(111+30)=30/141=21.3%). My equity is around 18% if I have flush draw, but I might have some additional equity if Ace is good (unlikely). So pot odds are slightly worse than needed.\n\nBut I need to consider implied odds if I hit flush. Also opponent tendencies. Let me recall opponent actions. Use tool"

          "content": "I need to analyze the situation. I have Ac8s on BTN. Board: 3s 7c 7s 6c. I have Ace high with flush draw (need spade). Opponent in BB called preflop, then donk bet flop 15 into ~21 pot? Actually preflop: I raised to 10, BB called 8 more, pot was 1+2+10+8=21. Flop: BB bet 15 into 21, I called. Turn: pot is 21+15+15=51? Wait: flop pot was 21, BB bet 15, I called 15, so pot after flop = 21+15+15=51. Turn: BB bets 30 into 51, making pot 81, I need to call 30.\n\nMy stack: 175. After calling, I'd have 145 left. Pot would be 111. If I hit flush on river, I might get more chips.\n\nOpponent tendencies: From limited data, opponent has folded both previous hands preflop. No postflop history. This is first hand they've played postflop. They called preflop from BB, then donk bet flop and turn. Could have a 7 (trips), a straight draw, a flush draw, or maybe a pair like 6x. Board is paired with 7s, so trips are possible. They might have 7x, 66, 33, or a draw.\n\nMy hand: Ace high with flush draw. I have 9 spade outs (13 total - 2 board - 2 hand = 9). Some spades might give opponent full house if they have 7x with spade? Unlikely. My equity: ~18% to hit flush by river. Pot odds: need to call 30 to win 111+30=141, so 30/141=21.3%. Slightly negative immediate odds.\n\nBut implied odds: If I hit flush, I might get paid on river. My stack is 145 after call, pot would be 111. If I bet 50-100 on river and get called, that's good. However, if opponent has a 7 (trips), they might have redraw to full house if board pairs. Also, if opponent has flush draw too (unlikely since board has two spades, they might have spade draw), we could be drawing to same flush.\n\nAlso, I have position (BTN). I can see river for free if I call turn. If I miss river, I can check-fold.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 87.5BB, healthy stack. Opponent has 145 chips (72.5BB). Not desperate.\n\nDecision: Fold or call? Raise seems bad with just draw. Could semi-bluff raise, but opponent has shown strength with donk bet flop and turn. They likely have something. Raising might get them to fold weaker hands, but they might call or shove with strong hand.\n\nGiven pot odds are close (21% needed, ~18% equity), and implied odds if I hit flush, I could call. But need to consider reverse implied odds: if I hit Ace, might not be good; if I hit flush but board pairs, could lose to full house.\n\nAlso, I might have some fold equity if I raise, but with only 9 clean outs, not great.\n\nBetter to fold? Let's think: I'm getting almost correct odds. If I assume I have 9 outs, that's 9/46 = 19.6% (actually 9/46 = 19.57%). Close to 21.3% needed. If I include Ace as maybe 3 outs (but Ace might not be good), that's 12/46 = 26%. But Ace likely not good if opponent has 7 or pair.\n\nAlso, opponent might fold to raise if they have draw. But they bet flop and turn, seems strong.\n\nI think fold is reasonable. But let's consider: I have position, and calling 30 to potentially win big if I hit flush. However, stack sizes: after calling, I have 145, pot 111. If I hit flush, I can bet maybe 50-100 and get called by trips. Good implied odds.\n\nBut also, opponent might have flush draw too (with spades). Then we split or I lose if they have higher flush. They could have AsXs for nut flush draw. But they called from BB, could have many spade hands.\n\nActually, they called from BB preflop. Range includes many hands: suited connectors, small pairs, broadways. They donk bet flop and turn. This often indicates strong hand like trips or strong draw.\n\nI think I should fold. Pot odds not quite there, and reverse implied risks.\n\nBut wait, I"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze the situation. I have Ac8s on BTN. Board: 3s 7c 7s 6c. I have Ace high with flush draw (need spade). Opponent in BB called preflop, then donk bet flop 15 into ~21 pot? Actually preflop: I raised to 10, BB called 8 more, pot was 1+2+10+8=21. Flop: BB bet 15 into 21, I called. Turn: pot is 21+15+15=51? Wait: flop pot was 21, BB bet 15, I called 15, so pot after flop = 21+15+15=51. Turn: BB bets 30 into 51, making pot 81, I need to call 30.\n\nMy stack: 175. After calling, I'd have 145 left. Pot would be 111. If I hit flush on river, I might get more chips.\n\nOpponent tendencies: From limited data, opponent has folded both previous hands preflop. No postflop history. This is first hand they've played postflop. They called preflop from BB, then donk bet flop and turn. Could have a 7 (trips), a straight draw, a flush draw, or maybe a pair like 6x. Board is paired with 7s, so trips are possible. They might have 7x, 66, 33, or a draw.\n\nMy hand: Ace high with flush draw. I have 9 spade outs (13 total - 2 board - 2 hand = 9). Some spades might give opponent full house if they have 7x with spade? Unlikely. My equity: ~18% to hit flush by river. Pot odds: need to call 30 to win 111+30=141, so 30/141=21.3%. Slightly negative immediate odds.\n\nBut implied odds: If I hit flush, I might get paid on river. My stack is 145 after call, pot would be 111. If I bet 50-100 on river and get called, that's good. However, if opponent has a 7 (trips), they might have redraw to full house if board pairs. Also, if opponent has flush draw too (unlikely since board has two spades, they might have spade draw), we could be drawing to same flush.\n\nAlso, I have position (BTN). I can see river for free if I call turn. If I miss river, I can check-fold.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 87.5BB, healthy stack. Opponent has 145 chips (72.5BB). Not desperate.\n\nDecision: Fold or call? Raise seems bad with just draw. Could semi-bluff raise, but opponent has shown strength with donk bet flop and turn. They likely have something. Raising might get them to fold weaker hands, but they might call or shove with strong hand.\n\nGiven pot odds are close (21% needed, ~18% equity), and implied odds if I hit flush, I could call. But need to consider reverse implied odds: if I hit Ace, might not be good; if I hit flush but board pairs, could lose to full house.\n\nAlso, I might have some fold equity if I raise, but with only 9 clean outs, not great.\n\nBetter to fold? Let's think: I'm getting almost correct odds. If I assume I have 9 outs, that's 9/46 = 19.6% (actually 9/46 = 19.57%). Close to 21.3% needed. If I include Ace as maybe 3 outs (but Ace might not be good), that's 12/46 = 26%. But Ace likely not good if opponent has 7 or pair.\n\nAlso, opponent might fold to raise if they have draw. But they bet flop and turn, seems strong.\n\nI think fold is reasonable. But let's consider: I have position, and calling 30 to potentially win big if I hit flush. However, stack sizes: after calling, I have 145, pot 111. If I hit flush, I can bet maybe 50-100 and get called by trips. Good implied odds.\n\nBut also, opponent might have flush draw too (with spades). Then we split or I lose if they have higher flush. They could have AsXs for nut flush draw. But they called from BB, could have many spade hands.\n\nActually, they called from BB preflop. Range includes many hands: suited connectors, small pairs, broadways. They donk bet flop and turn. This often indicates strong hand like trips or strong draw.\n\nI think I should fold. Pot odds not quite there, and reverse implied risks.\n\nBut wait, I",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to provide a JSON response. Let me structure my decision.\n\nAction options: fold, call, raise. I'm considering fold vs call. Raise seems too aggressive with just a draw against a player showing strength.\n\nPot: 81, bet 30 to call. Pot odds: 30/(81+30+30) = 30/141 = 21.3%. My equity with flush draw: 9 outs, 9/46 = 19.6%. Slightly negative immediate odds. Implied odds: if I hit flush on river, I could get paid maybe 50-100 more chips. But opponent might also have flush draw or full house redraw. Position helps.\n\nStack sizes: I have 175, opponent 145. If I call, I have 145 left, pot 111. If I hit flush, I can bet maybe 50-100. Good implied odds.\n\nBut opponent's line: called preflop from BB, donk bet flop and turn. This often indicates a strong hand like trips (7x), maybe two pair (76s), or a draw. Since board is paired with 7s, trips are likely. They might have 7x, 66, 33. 66 makes full house already. 33 makes full house. But they bet flop and turn, could be 7x. If they have 7x, they have redraw to full house if board pairs. If I hit flush but board pairs, I lose.\n\nAlso, they might have flush draw themselves. As BB caller, could have suited spades. Then my flush draw is not nut (I have Ac8s, Ace high flush if I hit, but if they have Ks or Qs, they might have higher flush draw). Actually, I have Ace of clubs, not spades. Wait: my cards: Ac 8s. I have 8 of spades, Ace of clubs. So I have 8s, board has 3s and 7s. So I have 8 of spades, need one more spade for flush. My flush would be 8-high flush if no higher spades on board. That's weak. Opponent could have higher spade. So my flush might not be good even if I hit. That's a big concern.\n\nActually, board has 3s and 7s. If river is spade, flush possible. My 8-high flush is weak. Opponent could have 9s, Ts, Js, Qs, Ks, As (though As is less likely since I have Ac). But they could have any spade higher than 8. That's many combos. So my flush might be second best.\n\nGiven that, my equity is worse. Maybe only 6-7 outs if some spades give opponent better flush. Plus Ace outs maybe not good.\n\nThus, fold seems best.\n\nI'll fold. Reasoning: Ace-high with weak flush draw (8-high) facing turn bet on paired board. Pot odds not favorable given weak draw and risk of being outflushed. Opponent's line suggests strong hand. Better to preserve stack.\n\nJSON: {\"action\": \"fold\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"Ace-high with weak 8-high flush draw facing turn bet on paired board.

This is their first preflop raise in the observed hands, suggesting they might have a decent hand.\n\nMy hand is 2h 4d, which is one of the worst possible starting hands in poker. It's unsuited, unconnected, and low cards. Even with the BB discount (I already have 2 chips in), calling 6 more chips with 24o is generally -EV.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 6 to win 11 (current pot). That's about 1.83:1 odds, meaning I need ~35% equity. 24o has nowhere near that against any reasonable raising range.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 86.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to gamble with trash hands. Folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\nThe opponent's raise size is 4x BB, which is a bit larger than standard, possibly indicating strength.\n\nGiven all this, folding is clearly the correct play. Let me check if there are any other factors - maybe the opponent is opening wide from UTG? They're in Seat 1, which appears to be UTG position. A raise from UTG with 24o in the BB is an easy fold.\n\nI should also consider that I'm getting closing action - everyone else has folded, so it's heads-up. But even heads-up, 24o is terrible.\n\nThe only reason to continue would be if I thought I could outplay postflop, but with such a weak hand and position disadvantage (I'll be out of position), it's not worth it.\n\nI'll fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have 6h Td on the Button (BTN)\n- My stack: 172 chips (86 BB)\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raised to 6 (3x BB)\n- Amount to call: 6\n- Pot is currently 9 (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise)\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button, which is excellent position. However, my hand is very weak - T6 offsuit is a bottom-tier hand.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:** From the recall, Kimi-K2 has raised preflop to 6 chips in both previous hands where they raised (hands 2 and 7). This suggests a consistent 3x BB opening size. I don't have showdown information about what hands they showed down with.\n\n**My History:** I've folded 6 out of 7 hands, winning only 1 hand. My stack is 172 chips, which is below average but not critical.\n\n**Pot Odds:** To call 6 into a pot of 15 (9 current + 6 if I call), I'm getting 2.5:1 pot odds. However, there are still players behind me who could act: MiniMax-M2 (SB) and GPT-OSS-120B (BB). They could call or raise.\n\n**Hand Strength:** T6o is a terrible hand. It has poor high-card value, no connectivity, and is offsuit. Even with position, this hand plays poorly postflop. It's only good for bluff catching or hitting two pair+.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** With 86 BB, I have plenty of chips. No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands.\n\n**Alternatives:** I could consider 3-betting as a bluff given my position, but T6o is too weak even for that. Folding is clearly correct.\n\nThe button position is tempting, but the hand is just too weak to play, especially facing a raise. Even if I call, I'll be out of position against the raiser postflop unless everyone folds, which is unlikely given the blinds still to act.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. Wait for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm UTG with Jc8c. This is a very weak hand to open from UTG. It's a suited connector but low (J8s). In tournament poker, especially from UTG, I should be playing tight.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB): Has mostly folded preflop (7/10 times), raised once, checked once, bet once postflop. Seems fairly tight.\n- MiniMax-M2 (next to act after me): Has mostly folded preflop (8/10 times), called once, and was involved in one hand postflop. Very tight.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (SB): Has called twice preflop, folded 3 times, and been aggressive postflop in hands they play.\n\nMy stack is 172 chips (86 BB), which is healthy but not huge. The blinds are 1/2, so I have plenty of room to be patient.\n\nFrom UTG with J8s, the standard play is to fold. While it's suited and can make flushes, it's not a strong enough hand to open from early position. The J8 gap is also problematic - it's a \"gap connector\" but the gap is large (5 cards between J and 8).\n\nIf I raise, I'll be out of position against the entire table, which is difficult with a marginal hand. If I call, I'll invite others to call behind me, creating a multiway pot with a weak hand.\n\nGiven my tournament position (86 BB) and the need to preserve chips, folding is the correct play. I should wait for better spots, especially since I'm UTG and have 5 players left to act behind me (including the blinds).\n\nThe pot odds are 3:2 (2 to call into 3 pot), but implied odds are poor because I'll be out of position and the hand doesn't have great postflop playability.\n\nLet me check if there's any history of opponents being particularly loose or aggressive that might change this decision. Looking at the opponent actions, they seem fairly tight overall. Only one raise preflop from Kimi-K2 Thinking in 10 actions, and most players are folding frequently.\n\nThus, I should fold.",

The action: MiniMax-M2 raised to 4 (2x BB), then Kimi-K2 Thinking re-raised to 12 (6x BB). I need to call 10 chips to continue.\n\nPot is currently: SB (1) + BB (2) + MiniMax's raise (4) + Kimi-K2's re-raise (12) = 19 chips. I need to call 10, so pot odds are 19:10 or about 1.9:1 (34.5% equity needed).\n\nPocket 9s is a medium pocket pair. Against a 3-bet range, it's decent but vulnerable. Looking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown one preflop raise in hand #6 (to 8), otherwise mostly folds. This re-raise suggests a strong hand.\n- MiniMax-M2 has mostly folded preflop, but called once and bet on the turn in hand #4.\n\nMy position is poor (SB), so I'll be out of position postflop against the aggressor. Stack depth is 85 BB, which is decent.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: Pocket 9s doesn't play well against a 3-bet range, especially out of position. Could save chips.\n2. Call: Set mining with implied odds. Need about 7:1 implied odds to justify set mining (about 12% chance to hit set). If I call 10, I'd need to win ~70 chips postflop if I hit my set. Possible but risky.\n3. Raise: Could 4-bet, but with 99 and deep stacks, this seems spewy against a 3-bet.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 85 BB, which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots.\n\nGiven the 3-bet size (6x BB), this looks like a strong hand. Pocket 9s is likely behind against a typical 3-bet range (TT+, AK, AQ maybe). Out of position makes it worse.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. The pot odds (1.9:1) don't justify calling with a medium pocket pair out of position against a 3-bet. Better to wait for a better spot."

The action: MiniMax-M2 raised to 4 (2x BB), then Kimi-K2 Thinking re-raised to 12 (6x BB). I need to call 10 chips to continue.\n\nPot is currently: SB (1) + BB (2) + MiniMax's raise (4) + Kimi-K2's re-raise (12) = 19 chips. I need to call 10, so pot odds are 19:10 or about 1.9:1 (34.5% equity needed).\n\nPocket 9s is a medium pocket pair. Against a 3-bet range, it's decent but vulnerable. Looking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has shown one preflop raise in hand #6 (to 8), otherwise mostly folds. This re-raise suggests a strong hand.\n- MiniMax-M2 has mostly folded preflop, but called once and bet on the turn in hand #4.\n\nMy position is poor (SB), so I'll be out of position postflop against the aggressor. Stack depth is 85 BB, which is decent.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: Pocket 9s doesn't play well against a 3-bet range, especially out of position. Could save chips.\n2. Call: Set mining with implied odds. Need about 7:1 implied odds to justify set mining (about 12% chance to hit set). If I call 10, I'd need to win ~70 chips postflop if I hit my set. Possible but risky.\n3. Raise: Could 4-bet, but with 99 and deep stacks, this seems spewy against a 3-bet.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 85 BB, which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots.\n\nGiven the 3-bet size (6x BB), this looks like a strong hand. Pocket 9s is likely behind against a typical 3-bet range (TT+, AK, AQ maybe). Out of position makes it worse.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. The pot odds (1.9:1) don't justify calling with a medium pocket pair out of position against a 3-bet. Better to wait for a better spot.",

The initial raise to 4 could be a wide range.\n\nMy pocket 9s: Medium pocket pair, vulnerable to overcards. Against a 3-bet range from Kimi-K2 Thinking (likely TT+, AK, AQ, maybe JJ), I'm in rough shape. Being out of position in SB makes it worse.\n\nPot is 19, I need to call 10. Pot odds: 19:10 = 1.9:1, requiring ~34.5% equity. Pocket 9s vs a tight 3-bet range (TT+, AK, AQs, maybe AQo) has ~35-40% equity. Borderline.\n\nHowever, implied odds: If I hit a set (12% chance), I could win a big pot. But out of position, it's hard to extract maximum value. Also, stack sizes: I have 170 total, calling 10 leaves 160. If I hit set, I could potentially win opponent's 184 stack.\n\nTournament stage: Early, 85 BB deep.

This gives me good control over the hand.\n\n**Potential Strategies:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card and see the turn. With a backdoor flush draw and position, this might be best.\n2. **Raise**: Semi-bluff to try to take the pot down now. But with only queen-high and weak draws, this is risky.\n3. **Fold**: Not an option since checking is free.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 84 BB, a healthy stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands\n- Position allows me to play cautiously\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check. Reasons:\n- Free card with backdoor draws\n- Position advantage lets me see what opponent does on turn\n- Very weak made hand - not worth investing chips\n- If opponent bets on turn, I can easily fold\n- If turn improves my draw, I can consider continuing\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking with queen-high and backdoor flush draw. Position allows free card with potential to improve on turn. Very weak made hand not worth investing chips. Will reassess on turn based on opponent action and board development.\"\n}",

The board is Ah 9d 5s 8c. I have:\n- No pair\n- Backdoor flush draw (need heart on river)\n- Backdoor straight draw (need 7 or 4 to make 5-8 straight, but with Q3 that's unlikely)\n- Essentially queen high\n\nThe pot is tiny (4 chips). I'm in position on the button. Opponent checked flop after I checked.\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Seat 4 - MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the data:\n- Folded preflop in hands 6-10\n- In hand 11: raised preflop to 4, called a 3-bet to 8, then checked flop, checked turn, and bet river (8 chips)\n- Seems to be a tight player who folds a lot preflop\n- When they do play, they're capable of aggression (preflop raise in hand 11) and river betting\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 84 BB, which is healthy\n- Pot is only 4 chips (2 BB)\n- No need to get involved with a weak hand\n\n**Decision:**\nWith queen high on an Ace-high board, I have virtually no chance of winning at showdown unless opponent completely misses. The pot is tiny, so there's little to gain. However, I'm in position and could potentially bluff if I think opponent is weak.\n\nGiven opponent checked flop and turn so far, they likely have a weak hand too. But with an Ace on board, they could have any Ace, which beats me. Or they could have a pair like 9, 8, or 5.\n\nThe prudent play is to check and see a free river. If I hit a heart or miracle queen, I might win. If not, I can fold to any river bet.\n\n**Action:** Check.",

The board has Ah, Jh, 9d, 8c, 5s. My best hand is Queen-high. The Jh on the river doesn't help me. I have a busted flush draw (hearts didn't come). This is a very weak hand.\n\n**Opponent Analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the search results, I can see MiniMax-M2:\n- Hand #11: Had pocket 9s, raised preflop, called a 3-bet, checked through flop and turn, then bet 8 on river on a scary board (As Ac Tc Ts 5c) and got a fold\n- Hand #4: Called a flop bet with Jd Kh on 9h 5d 3c board, then bet turn when checked to\n- Hand #9: Folded preflop\n- Generally seems to play somewhat cautiously but capable of value betting\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- The pot is only 4 chips (tiny)\n- I have position (act first on river)\n- Both of us have checked through flop and turn\n- The river Jack is a medium card that could complete some draws\n\n**Possible Opponent Hands:**\n- Could have weak Ace, middle pair, or missed draw\n- Given the checking pattern, likely doesn't have a strong hand\n- Might have a Jack or weak pair\n\n**Decision Options:**\n1. **Check**: Give up with Queen-high, pot goes to showdown\n2. **Bet/Bluff**: Try to steal the tiny pot with a bluff\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Pot is only 4 chips - not worth risking much\n- My hand is very weak (Queen-high)\n- Opponent might call with any pair or Ace-high\n- Bluff success probability is low given my weak hand and board texture\n- Tournament implications: I have 84 BB, so preserving chips is more important than trying to steal 2 BB\n\n**Optimal Decision:** Check and give up. The pot is too small to risk a bluff, and my hand has zero showdown value. If opponent has anything at all (even Ace-high), they'll call.

The key factors:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 7-9o is weak, not suited, not connected well. It plays poorly postflop.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is great - I get to act last postflop.\n3. **Stack size**: 84 BB is healthy, but I'm the shortest stack at the table.\n4. **Opponents**: SB and BB are yet to act. They could have strong hands or could check.\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 to win 5 (3 pot + my 2 call), so I'm getting 2.5:1 odds.\n\nHowever, 7-9o is a hand that needs implied odds to be profitable - I need to hit a strong hand (two pair, trips, straight) to win a big pot. With only the blinds left to act, there's a chance they might check if I limp, but they could also raise.\n\nGiven that I'm the shortest stack and have been playing tight, I could consider a small raise to steal the blinds. But 7-9o is not a good hand to raise with from any position, even the button. The risk is that one of the blinds has a decent hand and calls or re-raises.\n\nBetter to either fold or call. Calling (limping) could be okay if I think the blinds will often check. But if they raise, I'll have to fold and lose 2 chips.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: Seat 4 has 219 chips, Seat 5 has 226 chips. I have 168 chips. I'm the short stack. In tournament poker, preserving chips is important.\n\nGiven the weakness of my hand and my short stack status, folding seems prudent. 7-9o is just too weak to play from any position, even the button. The 2 chips I save could be more valuable later with a better hand.\n\nI'll fold.",

Reasons:\n1. J8o is a weak hand, especially from UTG position\n2. I have 3 players behind me who can act (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, and Kimi-K2 Thinking)\n3. Both MiniMax-M2 and GPT-OSS-120B have shown they will raise preflop\n4. Even if I call the 2 chips, I'll be out of position postflop against potentially multiple opponents\n5. The hand doesn't have good implied odds - it's not suited, not connected well\n6. Tournament strategy: preserve stack and wait for better spots\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a stronger hand in better position.",

The hand has poor high card value and minimal straight potential. From UTG, we should be playing tight.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations. I have 84 BB, which is a healthy stack. I don't need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 chips into a pot of 3 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 pot odds. But that's not great considering the hand strength.\n\nPosition: Being UTG means I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand, which makes K4o even worse.\n\nGiven all this, the standard play is to fold K4o from UTG. There's no reason to play this hand. Even calling would be bad because I'll be out of position with a weak hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- My hand: Tc Qc (Ten of clubs, Queen of clubs)\n- Board: 9c Jh Ad (9 clubs, Jack hearts, Ace diamonds)\n- Position: BB, facing opponent in SB who raised preflop to 6 and then checked on flop\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- My stack: 162 chips (81 BB)\n- Opponent stack: 192 chips\n\n**Hand strength:**\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (need a King for a straight: Qc-Tc-9c-Jh-Ad, K would give me Q-K-T-J-9 straight)\n- Backdoor flush draw (two clubs, board has one club)\n- Very weak made hand - Queen high with one overcard to board (Queen vs Jack and 9)\n- Ace on board is a concern - opponent could have Ace-x\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the data, opponent (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) has raised preflop 3 times out of 15 hands (hands 2, 7, 8). They've folded a lot recently (hands 9-15 all folds preflop). This suggests they might be tightening up or had weak cards. Their preflop raise to 6 (3x BB) is standard.\n\n**Flop analysis:**\nBoard is 9c Jh Ad - this is a relatively dry board except for the Ace. The flop likely missed many hands. Opponent checked after raising preflop, which could mean:\n1. They have a weak Ace (A-x with weak kicker)\n2. They missed completely (like KQ, Q10, etc.)\n3. They're slow-playing a strong hand (AA, AJ, A9, sets) - less likely since they'd probably bet for value\n\n**My options:**\n1. **Check**: Take free card, see turn. With my draws, this is reasonable.\n2. **Raise**: Semi-bluff with draws. Could represent an Ace or strong hand.\n\n**Stack considerations:** I have 81 BB, opponent has 96 BB. I'm not short-stacked.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 12 chips. If I bet, I'd need fold equity or good implied odds for draws.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that opponent checked after raising preflop, they likely don't have a strong Ace or set. They might have missed or have a weak Ace. I have decent draws: gutshot straight (4 outs) + backdoor flush (roughly 1.5 outs) + maybe Queen outs if they have weak Ace (3 outs). That's about 8.5 outs total, ~18% equity.\n\nA semi-bluff bet could win the pot now if they fold weak hands. If they call, I still have decent equity. Minimum raise is to 4 chips (bet 2 chips), but I should bet more for fold equity.\n\nI think a moderate bet of 6-8 chips (half pot) is good. Let me bet 8 chips (raise to 8 total, betting 6 into 12 pot). This gives me good fold equity while not overcommitting.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Semi-bluff with gutshot straight draw and backdoor flush draw.

Stack: 173 chips (86.5 BB) - healthy stack\n4. Action: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 4 (2x BB), then Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) 3-bet to 14 (7x BB)\n5. Amount to call: 13 chips, pot is 21 + 13 = 34 chips? Actually pot calculation: SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 4 + 3-bet 14 + my SB 1 already posted = 22? Wait, let me recalculate:\n   - SB (me): 1 already posted\n   - BB (Seat 4): 2 posted  \n   - Seat 5: raise to 4\n   - Seat 1: raise to 14\n   - Seat 2: folded\n   - Pot = 1 + 2 + 4 + 14 = 21 chips\n   - I need to call 13 more (14 total - my 1 already posted)\n\nFrom the opponent history:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop in hands 6 (8 chips) and 11 (12 chips)\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has raised preflop in hands 10 (8 chips) and 15 (6 chips)\n- Both seem to be active preflop\n\nWith 78o from SB facing a 3-bet, this is a very weak hand. The pot odds: need to call 13 to win 34 (21 current pot + my 13 call), so about 2.6:1 odds or ~28% equity needed.\n\n78o has very little equity against a 3-bet range. Even against a wide 3-bet range like top 15% of hands, 78o has only about 30% equity. But we're out of position, which reduces our playability significantly.\n\nTournament considerations: We have 86.5 BB, which is healthy. No need to gamble with marginal hands out of position.\n\nThe fact that we're in SB means we'll have to act first on every street, making this hand even harder to play.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. We're not getting good enough pot odds, and implied odds are poor since we're out of position.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

The only players left are the small blind (MiniMax-M2) and big blind (GPT-OSS-120B).\n\nLooking at the recall data:\n- MiniMax-M2 has raised preflop 3 times (hands 11, 13, 14) - seems to be somewhat aggressive\n- GPT-OSS-120B has also raised preflop 3 times (hands 10, 15, 17) - also aggressive\n- My own history shows I've folded a lot (14 folds out of 17 hands, win rate 11.8%)\n\nThe pot is 3 chips (SB 1 + BB 2). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop. My stack is 173 chips (86.5 BB).\n\nWith 9-5 offsuit, this is a trash hand. However, being on the button against just the blinds, sometimes players might try to steal with weak hands. But 9-5o is really bad - no connectedness, no suitedness, low cards.\n\nThe blinds are 1/2, so calling 2 chips is 1 BB. Pot odds: I need to call 2 to win 3, so I need ~40% equity. I definitely don't have 40% equity against random hands.\n\nIf I raise, minimum raise is to 4 total (2 more). But raising with this hand is too ambitious.\n\nGiven my position, I could consider a steal attempt, but:\n1. Both blinds have shown aggression\n2. My hand is terrible\n3. I have a healthy stack (86.5 BB)\n4. Better to wait for a better spot\n\nI should fold. No reason to play this hand. Even if I call and see a flop, I'll often miss completely or have a weak pair that's hard to play.\n\nTournament considerations: Preserve stack, wait for better opportunities. My win rate is low (11.8%), so I need to be selective.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

I need to call 2 more to match the BB, or raise to at least 8 total.\n\n**My stack**: 173 chips (43.2 BB) - healthy stack.\n\n**Opponent info**: MiniMax-M2 in BB (Seat 4) has 221 chips. Looking at their history:\n- They've raised preflop 3 times (hands 11, 13, 14) - seems somewhat aggressive\n- They've called preflop 3 times (hands 4, 11, 18)\n- They showed down Jc Tc in hand 12\n\n**My hand analysis**: Ah 4c is not a strong hand. Ace-rag offsuit. However, I'm on the button with position, which is valuable. Against a single BB who will likely defend wide, I have some playability.\n\n**Position advantage**: Being on the BTN means I get to act last postflop, which is a huge advantage.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 2 into a pot of 6 (after my SB). That's 3:1 pot odds, which is excellent. Even with a weak hand, these odds justify calling.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: I have a decent stack (43 BB), not desperate. But I also want to accumulate chips. Folding would be too tight given the excellent pot odds and position.\n\n**Possible actions**:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight given pot odds and position\n2. **Call (2)**: Good option - see a flop cheaply with position\n3. **Raise**: Could be good to take initiative, but with A4o, raising might commit us to a pot with a weak hand\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression (3 raises in recent hands), they might be willing to defend their BB with a wide range. Calling seems best - see a flop cheaply, then use position to make decisions.\n\nIf I hit an Ace or a good draw, I can continue. If not, I can fold cheaply.\n\n**Decision**: Call."

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current hand**: I'm on the BTN with Ah 4c. I've posted SB 2, BB (Seat 4: MiniMax-M2) posted 4. Everyone else folded. I need to call 2 more to match the BB, or raise to at least 8 total.\n\n**My stack**: 173 chips (43.2 BB) - healthy stack.\n\n**Opponent info**: MiniMax-M2 in BB (Seat 4) has 221 chips. Looking at their history:\n- They've raised preflop 3 times (hands 11, 13, 14) - seems somewhat aggressive\n- They've called preflop 3 times (hands 4, 11, 18)\n- They showed down Jc Tc in hand 12\n\n**My hand analysis**: Ah 4c is not a strong hand. Ace-rag offsuit. However, I'm on the button with position, which is valuable. Against a single BB who will likely defend wide, I have some playability.\n\n**Position advantage**: Being on the BTN means I get to act last postflop, which is a huge advantage.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 2 into a pot of 6 (after my SB). That's 3:1 pot odds, which is excellent. Even with a weak hand, these odds justify calling.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: I have a decent stack (43 BB), not desperate. But I also want to accumulate chips. Folding would be too tight given the excellent pot odds and position.\n\n**Possible actions**:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight given pot odds and position\n2. **Call (2)**: Good option - see a flop cheaply with position\n3. **Raise**: Could be good to take initiative, but with A4o, raising might commit us to a pot with a weak hand\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression (3 raises in recent hands), they might be willing to defend their BB with a wide range. Calling seems best - see a flop cheaply, then use position to make decisions.\n\nIf I hit an Ace or a good draw, I can continue. If not, I can fold cheaply.\n\n**Decision**: Call.",

That shows he's capable of donk betting on flop after checking preflop. He seems somewhat aggressive but has folded many hands preflop recently.\n\n**My hand history:**\nI've been folding a lot (17 folds out of 21 hands), winning only 3 hands. My stack is 171 chips (down from starting 200). Need to accumulate chips.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Top pair weak kicker. Vulnerable to better Aces (AK, AQ, AJ, AT) or two pair (K9, A9). Also vulnerable to draws (flush draw with clubs, straight draws).\n2. **Position:** I have position advantage - can see opponent's action first on turn/river.\n3. **Pot size:** Small pot (8 chips). Could try to build it with my top pair.\n4. **Stack sizes:** I have 171 chips, opponent has 221. Not huge difference.\n5. **Tournament:** Need to accumulate chips but also preserve stack.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check:** Control pot size, see turn card. But gives free card to draws.\n- **Bet/raise:** Build pot with top pair, charge draws, get value from worse hands.\n\nGiven I have top pair and position, I should bet for value and protection. The board is somewhat wet (flush draw possible with clubs, straight draws possible). A small bet (like 4-6 chips) seems reasonable. This builds the pot with my decent hand while not committing too much with weak kicker.\n\nI'll bet 5 chips (total 5 into 8 pot). That's a reasonable sizing.",

Need ~28% equity to call. 6-8o vs random hands has ~35% equity, but vs tight ranges probably less.\n5. **Tournament**: I have healthy stack, can afford to see a cheap flop.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold. 6-8o is too weak even on BTN against blinds. While position is good, the hand has very little potential to improve and will be dominated often. Better to wait for better spots. The tight opponents might defend their blinds with stronger ranges than random.\n\nHowever, let me consider if I should raise as a steal attempt. Minimum raise to 8 chips (4 more). If both fold, I win 6 chips. If called, I'm out of position with a weak hand. Given opponent tightness, a raise might work, but 6-8o is a poor hand to continue with if called.

The blinds are 2/4, so this is a 3x raise. My stack is 179 chips (44.8 BB).\n\nFrom the opponent action recall, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop 4 times in previous hands, always to 6 chips (1.5x BB). This time they raised to 12 (3x BB), which is a larger sizing than their previous raises. This could indicate a stronger hand.\n\nMy hand (K4o) is weak, especially facing a raise. King-four offsuit is a marginal hand that should typically be folded from the cutoff, especially facing a raise from early position. I have position on the raiser (they're in seat 2, I'm in seat 3), but that's not enough to justify playing such a weak hand.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 12 to win 18 (2+4+12). That's 12 to win 18, or 1:1.5 pot odds. I need about 40% equity to call. K4o likely has less than 40% equity against a raising range, especially given the opponent's adjusted sizing.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 44.8 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to gamble with marginal hands. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nThere are still players to act behind me (Seat 4 MiniMax-M2 and Seat 5 GPT-OSS-120B), which adds additional risk of being squeezed.\n\nGiven all this, the correct play is to fold.",

My stack is 179 chips (44.8 BB), which is healthy but not massive.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has been folding a lot recently (5 straight folds preflop)\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) raised in hand #24 and was involved in a big pot\n- MiniMax-M2 seems to play fairly tight based on the hands I saw\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has shown some aggression with raises (hand #24 raised to 30 preflop)\n\nFrom UTG with 6s7d, this is a clear fold. Reasons:\n1. The hand is very weak - suited connectors need to be played in position or with deep stacks, and 6-7 offsuit is particularly weak.\n2. Early position means I have 4 players left to act behind me who could raise.\n3. My stack is 44.8 BB, which is decent but not worth risking with this hand.\n4. Tournament considerations: Preserving my stack is important, and playing weak hands from early position is a good way to lose chips.\n5. The blinds are small relative to my stack, so I can wait for better spots.\n\nEven if I were on the button or in late position, this hand might be marginal, but from UTG it's an easy fold.

I need to call 8 chips to continue.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A6s is a decent hand in the BB to defend with. It's suited, has an Ace, and can make strong flush draws. However, it's dominated by better Ax hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position (BB vs UTG). This is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the opponent data for Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking):\n   - They've been folding a lot (14/20 actions are folds)\n   - They raised once preflop (hand #17: raised to 14)\n   - They called once preflop (hand #19: called 4 from BB)\n   - They've shown down with JQo (hand #19) and 86o (hand #9)\n   \n   This suggests they might be somewhat tight but not extremely so. Their raise from UTG indicates a decent hand, but not necessarily premium given they've shown down mediocre hands before.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18, I need to call 8. That's 2.25:1 pot odds (31% equity needed). A6s vs a typical UTG raising range (maybe 15-20% of hands) has about 35-40% equity.

I need to call 8 chips to continue.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A6s is a decent hand in the BB to defend with. It's suited, has an Ace, and can make strong flush draws. However, it's dominated by better Ax hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position (BB vs UTG). This is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the opponent data for Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking):\n   - They've been folding a lot (14/20 actions are folds)\n   - They raised once preflop (hand #17: raised to 14)\n   - They called once preflop (hand #19: called 4 from BB)\n   - They've shown down with JQo (hand #19) and 86o (hand #9)\n   \n   This suggests they might be somewhat tight but not extremely so. Their raise from UTG indicates a decent hand, but not necessarily premium given they've shown down mediocre hands before.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18, I need to call 8. That's 2.25:1 pot odds (31% equity needed). A6s vs a typical UTG raising range (maybe 15-20% of hands) has about 35-40% equity.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: As 6s (ace-six suited)\n- Board: 9c 7d 3h (rainbow, no flush draws)\n- My stack: 167 chips (41.8 BB)\n- Pot: 26 chips\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) with 175 chips\n- Position: I'm in BB, opponent is UTG (Seat 1)\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Preflop: Opponent raised to 12 (3x BB), I called 8 more from BB\n- Now on flop: No bet to call (amount to call is 0), I can check or raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My hand: Ace-high with backdoor flush draw (spades, but board has no spades yet)\n- Board: 9c 7d 3h - dry board, no obvious draws except maybe straight draws (8-T, 5-8)\n- I have overcard (Ace) and backdoor flush/straight possibilities\n- Opponent's range: UTG raise suggests stronger hands: pairs 77+, broadways, suited connectors\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding a lot recently (last 5 hands folded preflop). Only played one hand to showdown (hand 19) where they checked all streets. This suggests they might be playing tight/passive. However, they did raise preflop this hand from UTG, which indicates some strength.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. **Pot Control**: With Ace-high on a dry board, I'm likely behind most of UTG's raising range (pairs 99+, overpairs, maybe AJ+).\n2. **Initiative**: Opponent has preflop initiative, but checked to me on flop? Wait, actually the action says \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning it's my turn to act first on flop? Let me check: Seat 1 raised preflop, I called. On flop, I'm first to act (since I'm BB and called, opponent is UTG who raised). So I act first.\n3. **Stack Sizes**: I have 167 chips, opponent has 175. Pot is 26. Reasonable stack-to-pot ratio.\n4. **Tournament**: Need to preserve chips but also accumulate.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: Allows opponent to take control, but keeps pot small with marginal hand. Good for pot control.\n- **Raise**: Semi-bluff with Ace-high. Could represent a pair or draw. But board is dry, so less credible.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the dry board and my weak hand (ace-high with backdoor draws), checking seems best. I want to see what opponent does. If they bet, I can evaluate pot odds. If they check behind, I get a free turn card.\n\nMy backdoor flush draw needs two more spades, and backdoor straight draws are minimal (5-8 for a straight, but I have A6). Not much equity.\n\nI'll check and see opponent's action. If they bet small, I might call with implied odds for backdoor draws. If they bet big, I can fold.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Ace-high on dry board with backdoor draws.

My stack is 165 chips (41.2 BB), which is healthy but not huge.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been folding frequently preflop (folded hands 24, 25, 26). In hand 23, they called 2 from BB and then played aggressively postflop. In hand 22, they checked from BB when facing no raise.\n\nMy hand is T7 suited (diamonds). This is a weak hand, but I'm on the button with position. The BB has shown some willingness to defend their blind, but has folded the last 3 hands preflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 to win a pot of 6 (my 2 SB + BB 4). That's 3:1 pot odds, which is excellent. Even with a weak hand, I'm getting good immediate odds.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 41 BB, which is a decent stack. Folding costs nothing but gives up a potential steal opportunity. Calling keeps the pot small and lets me see a flop with position.\n\nRaising could be considered as a steal attempt, but T7s is not a great raising hand even on the button. The BB has been folding recently, so a raise might take it down preflop. Minimum raise to 8 would be putting in 6 more (total 8).\n\nHowever, my hand is weak and if called, I'll be out of position postflop (actually no, I'll have position since I'm button). But still, T7s plays poorly even in position.\n\nGiven the excellent pot odds (3:1) and position, I think calling is reasonable. Folding is too tight given the odds. Raising seems ambitious with such a weak hand.\n\nLet me check: I've already invested 2 as SB. Calling 2 more means total 4 to see flop with 6 in pot. That's good odds.\n\nI'll call and see a flop with position.",

On the flop of 9h As Qs, I have:\n- No pair\n- Backdoor straight draw (need J and 8 for a straight)\n- Backdoor flush draw (two spades, need runner-runner spades)\n- Very weak overall\n\nFrom opponent data, MiniMax-M2 has been fairly active but also folding preflop recently (folds in hands 24, 25, 26). They've shown some aggression post-flop (betting on flop and river in hand 23).\n\nThe pot is only 8 chips. I'm in position (button) which is good, but my hand has very little equity. I have 40.8 BB stack, which is healthy but not huge.\n\nGiven the board (A high with Q and 9), my opponent could have many better hands. Even if they have nothing, they might bluff at this dry board. My hand has almost no showdown value and minimal drawing potential.\n\nHowever, since the amount to call is 0 (I can check), and I'm in position, I might consider checking to see a free turn card. But realistically, what can improve my hand? Runner-runner straight or flush, which is about 4% equity.\n\nBetter to check and likely fold to any bet. Or I could consider a small bluff since I'm in position, but with such a weak hand and dry board, it's risky.\n\nActually, let me think: the board is As Qs 9h. This is a somewhat dry board. My opponent checked preflop from BB, so their range is wide. They might check again on flop. If I bet small, I could potentially take it down now. But if they call or raise, I'm in trouble.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and stack preservation, checking seems best. I have position, so I can see what they do on turn. If they check, I get a free card. If they bet, I can easily fold.\n\nLet me check.",

On this flop of 9h As Qs:\n- No pair\n- Backdoor straight draw (J-8 needed, but I have 7-10, so need J-8 or 8-J)\n- Backdoor flush draw with Ts (spade)\n- Essentially, I have nothing but some very weak draws\n\n**Opponent Analysis from recall:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's actions:\n- They tend to bet on the flop when they check preflop as BB (hands 18 and 23)\n- In hand 18: they bet 3 into a pot of ~6 after checking preflop\n- In hand 23: they bet 6 into a pot of ~12 after calling preflop\n- They seem to continuation bet when checked to on flop\n- They have been folding a lot preflop recently (hands 19-26 mostly folds)\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nPot is 12 chips, bet is 4 chips. I need to call 4 to win 16 (12+4). That's 4:16 or 1:4, meaning I need 20% equity to call.\n\n**Equity Estimate:**\nAgainst a reasonable range for BB who checked preflop and bets small on flop:\n- Could have any Ax, Qx, 9x, flush draws, straight draws\n- My hand has maybe 15-20% equity at best against that range\n- The backdoor draws are very weak\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 163 chips (40.8 BB) - decent stack\n- Opponent has 235 chips\n- Folding loses nothing but the 2 chips I already put in preflop\n\n**Position:**\nI'm on the button, which is good, but I checked the flop, showing weakness.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe small bet of 4 into 12 (1/3 pot) is a standard continuation bet. My hand has very little equity, and even if I hit one of my weak draws on the turn, I'll face more bets. The pot odds are borderline (need 20% equity, have maybe 15-20%). Given my weak hand and the fact that I'm drawing to very weak outs, folding is correct.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack for better spots.",

          "content": "Now I have a good picture. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 9h 7c - a mediocre offsuit hand\n- Position: BTN (button) - excellent position\n- Stack: 163 chips (40.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (3x BB)\n- Pot: 18 chips (blinds 2+4 + raise 12)\n- Amount to call: 12 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Kimi-K2):**\n- Has shown aggressive preflop raising tendencies (5 raises in 27 hands)\n- Typically raises to 6 (1.5x) but raised to 12 in hand #24 (current hand #28)\n- In hand #24, raised to 12, then called a 3bet to 18, then bet flop aggressively\n- Has folded many hands preflop when not raising\n- No showdown history found, so we don't know his actual hand strength\n\n**My History:**\n- I've folded a lot (22 folds in 27 hands)\n- Win rate: 14.8% (4 wins)\n- Recently folded 9-5o from BTN in hand #18\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 9-7o is weak, but has some potential for straights and pairs\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is huge advantage - we act last postflop\n3. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 12 to win 30 (18 pot + 12 opponent bet). That's 2.5:1 odds (29% equity needed)\n4. **Implied Odds**: Good position gives us implied odds if we hit\n5. **Stack Sizes**: Opponent has only 89 chips (22.25 BB), so he's short-stacked and might be pushing with wider range\n6. **Tournament**: We're not in danger zone, but should avoid marginal spots\n\n**Ranges:**\n- Opponent's 3x raise from early position (seat 2 is UTG+1?) suggests decent hand\n- With 22 BB stack, he might be pushing with medium pairs, broadways, suited connectors\n- 9-7o has ~30-35% equity against reasonable raising range\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Conservative, preserves stack\n- **Call**: Take position with marginal hand, see flop\n- **Raise**: Not recommended with this hand\n\nGiven the excellent position, decent pot odds (29% equity needed), and opponent's short stack (might be stealing), I think a call is reasonable. However, 9-7o is quite weak and we're out of position relative to the blinds who still act after us (SB and BB). Actually wait - we're on BTN, so SB and BB act after us preflop? No, preflop action goes: UTG (folded), UTG+1 (raised), then us on BTN, then SB, then BB. So we have position on everyone postflop.\n\nThe blinds still to act behind us is a concern - they could squeeze. But with opponent's 3x raise, they might fold.\n\nI think the best play is fold. 9-7o is just too weak even with position. The opponent's raise size (12 vs typical 6) suggests strength. Our equity is marginal at best. Better to wait for better spots.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other factors... The opponent has 89 chips, so if we call and hit, we can potentially win his stack. However, we're risking 12 chips (7.4% of our stack) with a weak hand.\n\nActually, reconsidering: With position and opponent's short stack, calling might be okay if we plan to play fit-or-fold on flop. But we need to consider reverse implied odds - if we hit a pair of 9s or 7s, we could be dominated.\n\nI think fold is correct. Let's look for better spots."

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have a good picture. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 9h 7c - a mediocre offsuit hand\n- Position: BTN (button) - excellent position\n- Stack: 163 chips (40.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (3x BB)\n- Pot: 18 chips (blinds 2+4 + raise 12)\n- Amount to call: 12 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Kimi-K2):**\n- Has shown aggressive preflop raising tendencies (5 raises in 27 hands)\n- Typically raises to 6 (1.5x) but raised to 12 in hand #24 (current hand #28)\n- In hand #24, raised to 12, then called a 3bet to 18, then bet flop aggressively\n- Has folded many hands preflop when not raising\n- No showdown history found, so we don't know his actual hand strength\n\n**My History:**\n- I've folded a lot (22 folds in 27 hands)\n- Win rate: 14.8% (4 wins)\n- Recently folded 9-5o from BTN in hand #18\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 9-7o is weak, but has some potential for straights and pairs\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is huge advantage - we act last postflop\n3. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 12 to win 30 (18 pot + 12 opponent bet). That's 2.5:1 odds (29% equity needed)\n4. **Implied Odds**: Good position gives us implied odds if we hit\n5. **Stack Sizes**: Opponent has only 89 chips (22.25 BB), so he's short-stacked and might be pushing with wider range\n6. **Tournament**: We're not in danger zone, but should avoid marginal spots\n\n**Ranges:**\n- Opponent's 3x raise from early position (seat 2 is UTG+1?) suggests decent hand\n- With 22 BB stack, he might be pushing with medium pairs, broadways, suited connectors\n- 9-7o has ~30-35% equity against reasonable raising range\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Conservative, preserves stack\n- **Call**: Take position with marginal hand, see flop\n- **Raise**: Not recommended with this hand\n\nGiven the excellent position, decent pot odds (29% equity needed), and opponent's short stack (might be stealing), I think a call is reasonable. However, 9-7o is quite weak and we're out of position relative to the blinds who still act after us (SB and BB). Actually wait - we're on BTN, so SB and BB act after us preflop? No, preflop action goes: UTG (folded), UTG+1 (raised), then us on BTN, then SB, then BB. So we have position on everyone postflop.\n\nThe blinds still to act behind us is a concern - they could squeeze. But with opponent's 3x raise, they might fold.\n\nI think the best play is fold. 9-7o is just too weak even with position. The opponent's raise size (12 vs typical 6) suggests strength. Our equity is marginal at best. Better to wait for better spots.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other factors... The opponent has 89 chips, so if we call and hit, we can potentially win his stack. However, we're risking 12 chips (7.4% of our stack) with a weak hand.\n\nActually, reconsidering: With position and opponent's short stack, calling might be okay if we plan to play fit-or-fold on flop. But we need to consider reverse implied odds - if we hit a pair of 9s or 7s, we could be dominated.\n\nI think fold is correct. Let's look for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to output the JSON response. Let me finalize my decision.\n\nThe situation: I have 9h 7c on the button. Seat 2 raised to 12 (3x BB). I need to decide between fold, call, or raise.\n\nMy analysis: 9-7o is a weak hand. Position is good but hand is too weak. Opponent raised to 12 which is larger than his typical 6, suggesting strength. Pot odds are 12 to win 30, needing 29% equity. 9-7o probably has around 30-35% against a reasonable raising range, but with reverse implied odds if we hit a pair. Also, the blinds still to act behind us could squeeze.\n\nGiven the weak hand and the fact that we're not desperate (40 BB stack), I think fold is best. Wait for better spots.\n\nSo my JSON response should be: {\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9-7o is too weak even with position.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze the current hand situation. I'm in UTG position with K9 suited (9s Ks). My stack is 163 chips (40.8 BB). The blinds are 2/4, pot is 6 chips. Seat 2 has already folded. I'm first to act after the blinds.\n\nLooking at my hand: K9 suited is not a strong UTG hand. It's speculative at best. In UTG position, I should generally be tight. From my hand history, I've been folding weak hands in UTG (I folded Th6s in UTG in hand #20, and 6s7d in UTG in hand #25).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: I see from the search that opponents have been raising preflop. Kimi-K2 has raised to 12 chips several times (hands #24, #28). GPT-OSS-120B has raised to 30 chips in hand #24. There are aggressive players at the table.\n\nMy position is bad - I'm UTG, so I have to act first and will face action from 4 players behind me. If I call, I'm likely to face raises from later positions.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. But implied odds with K9 suited are not great - it's mainly a drawing hand that needs to hit a flush or straight.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 40.8 BB, which is a decent stack. I should preserve it and look for better spots.\n\nGiven all this analysis:\n1. Hand strength: Weak for UTG (K9s is bottom of UTG opening range)\n2. Position: Terrible (UTG)\n3. Opponent tendencies: Aggressive, likely to raise behind me\n4. Pot odds: Not compelling for a speculative hand\n5. Tournament: Better to preserve stack for stronger spots\n\nThe correct play is to fold. I shouldn't be playing K9s from UTG, especially with aggressive players behind me.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K9s is too weak for UTG opening with aggressive players behind.

The SB (Kimi-K2) has raised to 12 total (8 more for me to call). The pot is 16 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise).\n\nLooking at the opponent data: Kimi-K2 has shown some aggression. In hand 28, they raised preflop and then continued betting on flop, turn. In hand 30, they called a raise preflop and then called bets on flop, turn, checked river. They seem like a reasonable player.\n\nMy stack is 159 chips (39.8 BB), which is healthy. The SB has 181 chips (45.3 BB). The pot odds: I need to call 8 chips to win 24 (16 current pot + 8 if I call). That's 2:1 pot odds, or 33% equity needed.\n\nWith 72o, I have very little equity against a SB raising range. Even against a wide SB stealing range, 72o has maybe 30-35% equity. But I'm out of position (BB vs SB), which makes the hand even worse to play postflop.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack, no need to take marginal spots. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nThe fact that I'm getting 2:1 pot odds is tempting, but with such a terrible hand and being out of position, this is an easy fold. I should only defend with much better hands from BB against a SB raise.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern of SB raising light that I should exploit. From the data, I see Kimi-K2 raised once preflop (hand 28) and folded twice, called once. Not enough data to say they're raising super light from SB.\n\nGiven all this, folding is correct."

Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has limped in for 4 chips. I need to call 2 more chips to see the flop.\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\n- My stack: 157 chips (39.2 BB) - healthy stack\n- Seat 2: 193 chips\n- Seat 4 (BB): 221 chips\n\n**Position:** I'm in the small blind, which is a terrible position postflop. I'll have to act first on every street after the flop.\n\n**Hand Strength:** Q4o is a very weak hand. It's offsuit, no connectivity, and dominated by many hands. It has reverse implied odds - if I hit a Q, I could be dominated by AQ, KQ, QJ, etc. If I hit a 4, it's a weak pair.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has shown a tendency to limp preflop (called 18 and 8 in previous hands). In hand #30, they limped with K9o and ended up winning with two pair.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression preflop with raises. In hand #29, they raised to 12 preflop.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I have a decent stack (39 BB). No need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands out of position.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 2 chips to win a pot of 12 chips (if BB checks). That's 6:1 pot odds, which is good mathematically. However, position and hand quality matter more.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Terrible hand (Q4o)\n2. Terrible position (SB)\n3. Likely facing a raise from the BB (MiniMax-M2 has shown aggression)\n4. Even if BB checks, I'll be out of position against a limper\n5. Reverse implied odds with Q4o\n\nThe small investment of 2 chips is tempting, but playing Q4o out of position against at least one opponent is a recipe for losing more chips postflop. The BB could easily raise, forcing me to fold after investing 2 chips.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. I'm not desperate for chips with 39 BB.\n\n**Final Decision:** Fold.",

This is a decent position to play from.\n\n**Stack:** 157 chips (39.2 BB) - healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): SB with 219 chips. From the history, they raised once from SB (hand #29) to 12, and otherwise mostly folded or checked. They seem somewhat tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): BB with 278 chips. They've folded a lot preflop recently (7 of last 8 hands). They seem very tight preflop.\n\n**Action:** Both early positions folded, SB posted 2, BB posted 4. Action is on me.\n\n**Hand strength:** KTo offsuit is a marginal hand. It's playable from the button, but not super strong. The T (ten) is a bit weak.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Conservative play given marginal hand\n2. **Call:** See a cheap flop with position\n3. **Raise:** Take initiative with position\n\n**Considerations:**\n- SB has shown some aggression (raised once from SB)\n- BB has been folding a lot\n- I have position advantage postflop\n- Pot is 6 chips, call is 4 chips (2.5% of my stack)\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 39BB, I'm not in push/fold territory. I can afford to play some speculative hands.\n\nGiven that BB has been folding a lot and I have position, I think raising could be good to try to take the pot preflop or get heads-up with position. However, KTo is not a great hand to raise with from the button - it's better to raise with stronger hands.\n\nCalling seems reasonable - it's cheap, I have position, and I can see a flop. If I hit a King or Ten, I can continue. If not, I can fold.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent tendencies: BB has folded to a lot of preflop raises recently. A raise might take it down immediately. But if called, I'm out of position against the SB or BB.\n\nWait, I'm on the button - I have position on both blinds. That's good.\n\nLet me think about sizing: Minimum raise is to 8 (double the BB). That's 4 more chips than calling. If I raise to 8, SB would need to call 6 more (from 2 to 8), BB would need to call 4 more (from 4 to 8).\n\nActually, I think calling is the best play here. KTo is a decent hand to see a flop with position, but not strong enough to raise for value. If I raise and get called, I'm building a bigger pot with a marginal hand.\n\nBetter to call, see a flop, and use my position advantage postflop. If I hit something, I can bet. If not, I can check/fold.\n\nI'll call."

From the history, they raised once from SB (hand #29) to 12, and otherwise mostly folded or checked. They seem somewhat tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): BB with 278 chips. They've folded a lot preflop recently (7 of last 8 hands). They seem very tight preflop.\n\n**Action:** Both early positions folded, SB posted 2, BB posted 4. Action is on me.\n\n**Hand strength:** KTo offsuit is a marginal hand. It's playable from the button, but not super strong. The T (ten) is a bit weak.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Conservative play given marginal hand\n2. **Call:** See a cheap flop with position\n3. **Raise:** Take initiative with position\n\n**Considerations:**\n- SB has shown some aggression (raised once from SB)\n- BB has been folding a lot\n- I have position advantage postflop\n- Pot is 6 chips, call is 4 chips (2.5% of my stack)\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 39BB, I'm not in push/fold territory. I can afford to play some speculative hands.\n\nGiven that BB has been folding a lot and I have position, I think raising could be good to try to take the pot preflop or get heads-up with position. However, KTo is not a great hand to raise with from the button - it's better to raise with stronger hands.\n\nCalling seems reasonable - it's cheap, I have position, and I can see a flop. If I hit a King or Ten, I can continue. If not, I can fold.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent tendencies: BB has folded to a lot of preflop raises recently. A raise might take it down immediately. But if called, I'm out of position against the SB or BB.\n\nWait, I'm on the button - I have position on both blinds. That's good.\n\nLet me think about sizing: Minimum raise is to 8 (double the BB). That's 4 more chips than calling. If I raise to 8, SB would need to call 6 more (from 2 to 8), BB would need to call 4 more (from 4 to 8).\n\nActually, I think calling is the best play here. KTo is a decent hand to see a flop with position, but not strong enough to raise for value. If I raise and get called, I'm building a bigger pot with a marginal hand.\n\nBetter to call, see a flop, and use my position advantage postflop. If I hit something, I can bet. If not, I can check/fold.\n\nI'll call.",

The board is 7c Th Ac, so I have middle pair (Tens) but the Ace on board is higher. Actually wait, I have a Ten, so I have a pair of Tens. The Ace is higher, so I don't have top pair - I have middle pair with King kicker.\n\nThe flop is Ace-high with a Ten. This is a decent flop for my hand - I have second pair with a good kicker. The Ace on board is concerning because it's likely to have hit many of my opponent's raising ranges.\n\nOpponent analysis: GPT-OSS-120B has been fairly tight recently (folded many hands preflop). Looking at the history:\n- Hand 23: Called flop bet, bet turn, folded river\n- Hand 24: Raised preflop to 30, check-raised flop to 60, bet turn\n- Many recent folds preflop\n\nThe opponent checked the flop from the BB after checking preflop. This suggests they likely have a weak hand or are slow-playing something strong.\n\nGiven the board (Ace-high), my middle pair with King kicker is decent but vulnerable. The pot is small (10 chips). I'm in position (BTN) against the BB.\n\nOptions:\n1. **Check**: Take a free card and see the turn. This is safe but gives up potential value if opponent has a weaker hand.\n2. **Bet**: Try to get value from weaker hands (smaller pairs, draws). A small bet could work.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 10 chips. If I bet 4-8 chips, I'm risking a small amount to potentially win the pot now or get value.\n\nGiven my position and the fact that opponent checked, I should probably bet for value with my second pair. Many weaker hands might call (smaller pairs, draws). If I get raised, I can reconsider.\n\nI'll make a small bet for value - maybe 6 chips (60% of pot). This is enough to get value from weaker hands but not too much to risk.\n\nLet me check the minimum raise: 4 chips. So I can bet 4-153 chips.\n\nI'll bet 6 chips (raise_to: 6). This is a reasonable value bet with middle pair in position."

The board is 7c Th Ac, so I have middle pair (Tens) but the Ace on board is higher. Actually wait, I have a Ten, so I have a pair of Tens. The Ace is higher, so I don't have top pair - I have middle pair with King kicker.\n\nThe flop is Ace-high with a Ten. This is a decent flop for my hand - I have second pair with a good kicker. The Ace on board is concerning because it's likely to have hit many of my opponent's raising ranges.\n\nOpponent analysis: GPT-OSS-120B has been fairly tight recently (folded many hands preflop). Looking at the history:\n- Hand 23: Called flop bet, bet turn, folded river\n- Hand 24: Raised preflop to 30, check-raised flop to 60, bet turn\n- Many recent folds preflop\n\nThe opponent checked the flop from the BB after checking preflop. This suggests they likely have a weak hand or are slow-playing something strong.\n\nGiven the board (Ace-high), my middle pair with King kicker is decent but vulnerable. The pot is small (10 chips). I'm in position (BTN) against the BB.\n\nOptions:\n1. **Check**: Take a free card and see the turn. This is safe but gives up potential value if opponent has a weaker hand.\n2. **Bet**: Try to get value from weaker hands (smaller pairs, draws). A small bet could work.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 10 chips. If I bet 4-8 chips, I'm risking a small amount to potentially win the pot now or get value.\n\nGiven my position and the fact that opponent checked, I should probably bet for value with my second pair. Many weaker hands might call (smaller pairs, draws). If I get raised, I can reconsider.\n\nI'll make a small bet for value - maybe 6 chips (60% of pot). This is enough to get value from weaker hands but not too much to risk.\n\nLet me check the minimum raise: 4 chips. So I can bet 4-153 chips.\n\nI'll bet 6 chips (raise_to: 6). This is a reasonable value bet with middle pair in position.",

Their recent folding streak indicates tight play. The fact they checked both preflop and flop suggests they don't have a strong Ace or premium hand.\n\nMy hand: Td Ks, board: 7c Th Ac\nI have middle pair (Tens) with King kicker. The Ace on board is the highest card, so I don't have top pair.\n\nGiven opponent's likely weak range and my position, betting for value makes sense. Many weaker hands (smaller pairs, draws) might call. If I get raised, I can fold since opponent has shown aggression with strong hands in Hand 24.\n\nPot is 10 chips.

The board is 7c Th Ac 4c. This is a decent but vulnerable hand. The Ac on board means I don't have top pair with Ace, which is good for me since my kicker is King. However, the flush draw is now present with two clubs.\n\n2. **Opponent's range**: BB checked preflop, called my flop bet, and now checks turn. They could have:\n   - A weaker Ten (T9, T8, etc.)\n   - A draw (flush draw with clubs, straight draws)\n   - A weak Ace (A7, A4, etc.)\n   - A slow-played strong hand (AT, A7, maybe even 77 for set)\n\n3. **Turn decision**: I have position and initiative. The pot is 22 chips. My options:\n   - **Check**: Take a free card, but gives opponent free river if they're on a draw\n   - **Bet**: Continue aggression, charge draws, get value from weaker Tens\n\n4. **Bet sizing considerations**: \n   - Small bet (6-8 chips): Gets called by draws and weaker hands, builds pot\n   - Medium bet (10-12 chips): More pressure on draws, still gets value\n   - Large bet (14+ chips): Puts serious pressure, may fold out weaker hands\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 147 chips (36.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. Opponent has 272 chips. I should play cautiously but also look for value.\n\n**Decision**: I think I should bet for value. I have top pair with a decent kicker, and many draws are available (flush draw, straight draws). A bet of 10-12 chips seems reasonable - about half pot. This charges draws while still getting value from weaker Tens.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious about the flush draw. If I bet and get raised, I might be in trouble. But given opponent's checking pattern, they're likely weak or drawing.\n\nLet me bet 12 chips (about 55% of pot). This puts pressure on draws while getting value from weaker holdings. If raised, I can re-evaluate based on sizing."

The board is 7c Th Ac 4c. This is a decent but vulnerable hand. The Ac on board means I don't have top pair with Ace, which is good for me since my kicker is King. However, the flush draw is now present with two clubs.\n\n2. **Opponent's range**: BB checked preflop, called my flop bet, and now checks turn. They could have:\n   - A weaker Ten (T9, T8, etc.)\n   - A draw (flush draw with clubs, straight draws)\n   - A weak Ace (A7, A4, etc.)\n   - A slow-played strong hand (AT, A7, maybe even 77 for set)\n\n3. **Turn decision**: I have position and initiative. The pot is 22 chips. My options:\n   - **Check**: Take a free card, but gives opponent free river if they're on a draw\n   - **Bet**: Continue aggression, charge draws, get value from weaker Tens\n\n4. **Bet sizing considerations**: \n   - Small bet (6-8 chips): Gets called by draws and weaker hands, builds pot\n   - Medium bet (10-12 chips): More pressure on draws, still gets value\n   - Large bet (14+ chips): Puts serious pressure, may fold out weaker hands\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 147 chips (36.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. Opponent has 272 chips. I should play cautiously but also look for value.\n\n**Decision**: I think I should bet for value. I have top pair with a decent kicker, and many draws are available (flush draw, straight draws). A bet of 10-12 chips seems reasonable - about half pot. This charges draws while still getting value from weaker Tens.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious about the flush draw. If I bet and get raised, I might be in trouble. But given opponent's checking pattern, they're likely weak or drawing.\n\nLet me bet 12 chips (about 55% of pot). This puts pressure on draws while getting value from weaker holdings. If raised, I can re-evaluate based on sizing.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with the proper JSON format. Let me think about the action:\n\nThe situation: Turn, board is 7c Th Ac 4c. I have Td Ks (top pair with King kicker). Opponent checked to me. Pot is 22 chips. Amount to call is 0. Legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nI want to bet for value. That would be a \"raise\" action since I'm betting when checked to. I need to specify \"raise_to\" as the total amount I'm putting in. If I want to bet 12 chips, that means I'm raising to 12 total (since I have 0 in so far). Actually wait - I need to be careful. The minimum raise to is 6. That means I need to put in at least 6 more than whatever the current bet is. Since it's checked to me and amount to call is 0, I think I can bet any amount from 6 to my entire stack.\n\nActually, in poker terminology: when facing a check and I want to bet, I use \"raise\" with \"raise_to\" being the amount I want to put in total. Since there's no bet to call, I'm essentially making a new bet. So if I want to bet 12 chips, I'd set \"raise_to\": 12.\n\nBut let me double-check: The \"minimum raise to: 6\" suggests that if I want to raise, I need to make it at least 6 total. That seems low - maybe it means I need to raise by at least 6 more than the current bet? But current bet is 0... Actually in no-limit, when checked to, you can bet any amount from the minimum bet (usually the big blind) up to your stack. The minimum bet is usually the big blind (4 chips). But it says \"minimum raise to: 6\" which is confusing.\n\nActually, I think \"minimum raise to: 6\" means that if I want to raise (bet), the minimum total amount I can put in is 6 chips. That makes sense: big blind is 4, so minimum bet would be 4, but maybe because previous street had betting, the minimum is 6? Or maybe it's a tournament rule.\n\nAnyway, I want to bet around 12 chips. That's above the minimum of 6. So I'll use \"raise\" with \"raise_to\": 12.\n\nReasoning: I have top pair with King kicker, should bet for value against draws and weaker Tens. Bet of 12 chips (55% pot) charges draws appropriately while building pot.\n\nLet me output JSON.",

UTG is the worst position to play from, especially with a weak hand like K2o.\n\nMy stack is 169 chips (42.2 BB), which is decent but not huge. The blinds are 2/4.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB): Has been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 hands), but did raise once to 12 chips in hand #30. They have the smallest stack at 133 chips.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has raised once preflop (hand #29) and folded most other times.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB): Has been folding a lot (5 out of 10 hands), checked once from SB, and called a bet on flop once.\n\nI'm first to act preflop. With K2o from UTG, this is an easy fold in most situations. The hand has very little potential - it's not suited, not connected, and the King is weak with a 2 kicker. Even if I hit a King, I'll often be dominated by better Kings.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6 chips (after my call, pot would be 10). That's 2.5:1 odds, but the hand is so weak that these odds don't justify playing.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 42 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to gamble with such a weak hand from early position.\n\nThere are still 4 players to act behind me (SB, BB, and two others who haven't acted yet). Even if I call, I could face raises from later positions.\n\nGiven all this, folding is clearly the best play. I should wait for better spots from better positions.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand:** 5c Jh (off-suit, weak hand)\n**Position:** BB (defending blind)\n**Stack:** 165 chips (41.2 BB)\n**Opponent:** Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) - 193 chips\n**Action:** Seat 2 raised to 12 total (8 more to call)\n**Pot:** 16 chips (4 BB + 2 SB + 10 raise)\n\nFrom opponent history:\n- Seat 2 has raised preflop multiple times: Hand #28 (raise 12), Hand #31 (raise 12)\n- They showed K9o in a showdown (Hand #30)\n- They seem moderately active but not overly aggressive\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. Hand strength: J5o is a very weak hand. It's dominated by many hands that would raise from SB.\n2. Position: We're out of position (BB vs SB) - this is a disadvantage postflop.\n3. Pot odds: Need to call 8 to win 24 (current pot 16 + our 8 call). That's 1:3 odds (25% equity needed).\n4. Implied odds: Poor with J5o - we're unlikely to hit a strong hand that can win a big pot.\n5. Stack preservation: We have 41.2 BB, which is healthy. No need to defend with trash.\n\n**Decision:** This is an easy fold. J5o has terrible equity against a SB raising range. Even if opponent is stealing, we need a better hand to defend. The 8 chips to call represent 4.8% of our stack, not worth it with this hand.\n\nWe should wait for better spots.",

I need to call 10 more (since I already posted 2 as SB).\n\n**Pot size**: 18 chips currently (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise).\n\n**Opponent analysis**:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been raising frequently preflop - shows 8 raise actions in history, mostly 6 chips early, now 12 chips recently. Shows tendency to raise light. Showdown hand was K9o, so not premium.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): In BB, has been folding to raises recently (folded last 3 hands to raises).\n\n**My hand**: 4s5s suited connectors. This is a speculative hand that plays well multi-way but not great heads-up out of position. As suited connectors, we want implied odds and multi-way pots.\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. **Position**: We're out of position against the raiser (Seat 2). This is a big disadvantage.\n2. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18, we need to call 10. That's 1.8:1 odds (35.7% equity needed). 45s against a typical raising range has ~30-35% equity heads-up.\n3. **Implied odds**: If we hit a flush or straight, we could win a big pot. But being out of position makes it harder to realize that equity.\n4. **Stack sizes**: We have 40.8 BB, opponent has 49.25 BB. Not deep enough for great implied odds.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: We have a healthy stack, no need to take marginal spots out of position.\n\n**Alternatives**: We could consider a 3-bet bluff, but with 45s that's too speculative. Fold seems correct.\n\nThe BB might come along, but they've been folding to raises recently. Even if they call, we're still out of position against the preflop aggressor.\n\nGiven all this, folding seems like the correct play. We preserve our stack and wait for better spots in position or with stronger hands."

I need to call 10 more (since I already posted 2 as SB).\n\n**Pot size**: 18 chips currently (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise).\n\n**Opponent analysis**:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been raising frequently preflop - shows 8 raise actions in history, mostly 6 chips early, now 12 chips recently. Shows tendency to raise light. Showdown hand was K9o, so not premium.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): In BB, has been folding to raises recently (folded last 3 hands to raises).\n\n**My hand**: 4s5s suited connectors. This is a speculative hand that plays well multi-way but not great heads-up out of position. As suited connectors, we want implied odds and multi-way pots.\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. **Position**: We're out of position against the raiser (Seat 2). This is a big disadvantage.\n2. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18, we need to call 10. That's 1.8:1 odds (35.7% equity needed). 45s against a typical raising range has ~30-35% equity heads-up.\n3. **Implied odds**: If we hit a flush or straight, we could win a big pot. But being out of position makes it harder to realize that equity.\n4. **Stack sizes**: We have 40.8 BB, opponent has 49.25 BB. Not deep enough for great implied odds.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: We have a healthy stack, no need to take marginal spots out of position.\n\n**Alternatives**: We could consider a 3-bet bluff, but with 45s that's too speculative. Fold seems correct.\n\nThe BB might come along, but they've been folding to raises recently. Even if they call, we're still out of position against the preflop aggressor.\n\nGiven all this, folding seems like the correct play. We preserve our stack and wait for better spots in position or with stronger hands.",

Looking at the opponent tendencies:\n\n1. MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has been fairly active recently. In hand 37, they called 8 preflop and then bet on flop, turn, and river. They've called twice preflop and folded several times. They seem willing to defend their blinds.\n\n2. GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has folded preflop in all recent hands (hands 32-37). They seem very tight, especially from the BB.\n\nMy position is excellent (button) with 40.8 BB. The pot is 6 chips (SB + BB). I need to call 4 to see the flop.\n\nWith 9-6 offsuit, this is a very weak hand. However, being on the button against potentially weak opponents gives me some stealing opportunity. The BB has been folding a lot, and the SB might fold to a raise if they have a weak hand.\n\nLooking at my own history, I won hand 33 on the button with KTs by calling preflop and betting post-flop. My win rate is low (13.5%) with many folds.\n\nGiven the situation:\n- Hand strength: Very weak (9-6 offsuit, no suitedness)\n- Position: Excellent (button)\n- Opponent tendencies: BB folds a lot, SB defends sometimes\n- Stack size: 40.8 BB (healthy)\n- Pot odds: 4 to win 6 (1.5:1)\n\nThis is a marginal spot. The standard play with 9-6 offsuit would be to fold. However, given that both opponents have folded to me (SB and BB), and I'm on the button, I could consider a steal raise. But 9-6 is really weak for a steal attempt.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (40.8 BB), so I don't need to take big risks. Preserving chips is important.\n\nGiven the BB's tendency to fold and the SB's mixed tendencies, I think the best play is to fold. 9-6 offsuit plays terribly post-flop, and even if I steal the blinds, it's only 6 chips. The risk of getting called and playing a weak hand out of position post-flop (if SB calls and BB folds, I'll be out of position on the flop) isn't worth it.\n\nI'll fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm UTG with 6d 2d. This is an absolutely terrible hand to play from UTG. It's suited, but it's 62s - one of the worst starting hands in poker. From UTG, I should be playing a very tight range.\n\nLet me consider the table dynamics. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised preflop multiple times, including a recent raise to 12 in hand #29. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has also raised preflop frequently, with raises to 12, 14, etc. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has raised preflop, including a large raise to 30 in hand #24.\n\nI'm first to act after the blinds. With 62s, I'm in the worst possible position with a weak hand. If I call, I'll be out of position against the entire field. There are 4 players left to act behind me (seats 4, 5, and the blinds can still act if I just call).\n\nThe pot is 6 chips, and I need to call 4 chips (40.8 BB stack). That's 2.5% of my stack, but the problem is not the immediate cost - it's the positional disadvantage and the likelihood of facing raises behind me.\n\nGiven the aggressive tendencies I've observed from opponents, there's a high probability that someone will raise behind me, forcing me to either fold (wasting my 4 chips) or call more chips with a terrible hand.\n\nAlso, even if I see a flop, 62s has very limited potential. It needs to hit a flush draw or two pair/trips to have any real value, and even then, it's vulnerable to better flushes or higher two pairs.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 40.8 BB, which is a decent stack. Preserving my stack is important. Getting involved with 62s from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\nThe only reasonable play here is to fold. Even calling is terrible because it sets me up for difficult decisions postflop out of position with a weak hand.\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to consider otherwise. Maybe if the table was very passive, but based on the recall data, there are multiple aggressive players who raise preflop frequently. This makes folding even more correct.\n\nMy decision: fold.",

Looking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot of marginal hands, which is reasonable. My stack is 163 chips (40.8 BB), which is a medium stack. The blinds are 2/4.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has been folding most hands preflop, but called a couple times and showed aggression postflop in hand #37.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) has been folding most hands preflop, only called once from SB in hand #39.\n\nThere are 4 players left to act after me (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, and the two Kimi-K2 players in blinds). J7o is a terrible hand to open from UTG. It has little postflop playability, is easily dominated, and has reverse implied odds (if I hit a J, I could be beat by better jacks).\n\nWith 40.8 BB, I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots. The pot is only 6 chips, and calling 4 chips would commit me to a hand that's likely to lose money postflop. Raising would be even worse with this hand from UTG.\n\nThe correct play is to fold. I should wait for better position and better hands to accumulate chips. My tournament life is more important than playing J7o from UTG.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Position:** I'm in the BB with 5s 2s, which is a very weak hand - 52s suited. Small blind (Seat 2) just completed the small blind to 8 total (called the additional 4). \n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 155 chips (19.4 BB), opponent has 153 chips. We're both similarly stacked.\n\n**Hand strength:** 52s is a very weak hand. As suited connectors go, it's one of the weakest. It has some speculative value if we hit a flush draw or straight draw, but generally should be folded from the BB when facing any raise. However, here the SB just completed, so I'm getting to see a free flop.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at Seat 2's actions, they have:\n- Folded preflop 6 times\n- Raised preflop 2 times (both to 12 chips)\n- Called once on the flop, turn, then folded river in hand #37\n\nThey seem fairly tight, folding most hands. The fact they just completed the small blind suggests they have a marginal hand they don't want to raise with but don't want to fold either.\n\n**Pot odds:** The pot is 16 chips (8 from me, 4 from SB, 4 from antes?). I have 0 to call, so I'm getting infinite pot odds to see a flop.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 19.4 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate. I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips, but also preserving my stack.\n\n**Decision:** With 52s suited, I should just check and see a free flop. There's no reason to raise with such a weak hand out of position against an opponent who likely has a marginal hand. Raising would be spewy - I'd be bloating the pot out of position with a weak hand. Folding would be giving up a free chance to potentially hit a big hand.\n\nThe best play is to check and see a flop. If I hit something like a flush draw or straight draw, I can continue. Otherwise, I can easily fold on the flop.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Getting to see a free flop with 52s suited from BB.

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with 5s2s. The board is 6s Kc Ad 3d. I have a small flush draw (spades) and a gutshot straight draw (I have 5-2, board has 6-A-3, so I need a 4 for a straight). Actually, let me check: I have 5-2, board is 6-K-A-3. I need a 4 to complete 2-3-4-5-6 straight. That's 4 outs. For the flush, I have 5s2s, board has 6s (one spade). So I have a flush draw with 9 remaining spades. However, the board has 3d (another diamond), so there's also a diamond draw possible. But I only have spades.\n\nPot is 28, opponent bet 12. So I need to call 12 to win 40 (28+12). That's pot odds of 12:40 or 3:10, meaning I need about 23% equity to call.\n\nLet me estimate my equity. I have a gutshot (4 outs) and a flush draw (9 outs). But some of these might overlap (4s would be both a straight and a spade). Actually 4s would be both. So total unique outs: 4 for straight (4c, 4h, 4d, 4s) and 8 more spades (since 4s already counted). That's 12 outs. But wait, 4d is a diamond, which might complete a diamond flush if opponent has diamonds. But anyway, 12 outs is about 12 * 2 = 24% equity on the river (using rule of 2). Actually with one card to come, each out is about 2%. So 12 outs is about 24%. That's barely above the 23% needed.\n\nBut there are complications: Some of my outs might not be clean. If opponent has a better hand like two pair or a set, my flush might not be good if the board pairs. Also, opponent might have a diamond draw themselves. But given the small bet (12 into 28), this seems like a weak bet, possibly a probe bet or a draw themselves.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot preflop. They raised preflop in hands 36 and 37. In hand 37, they called flop and turn bets then folded river. So they seem somewhat passive postflop. They limped preflop this hand (called SB to complete). That suggests a weak hand, maybe small pocket pair, suited connectors, or weak ace.\n\nGiven the board A-K-6-3, if they had a strong ace (AK, AQ, AJ) they might have raised preflop. More likely they have a medium pocket pair, a weak ace (A2-A5), or a draw. Their bet of 12 into 28 is small, about 43% pot. This could be a blocking bet with a weak hand or a draw.\n\nMy hand has decent equity with draws. I have position (they acted first on turn). If I call, I get to see river and can evaluate. My stack is 155, so calling 12 is about 8% of my stack. Not huge.\n\nHowever, I should consider implied odds: If I hit my flush or straight, I might get paid more. But my stack is relatively short (19BB), so implied odds are limited. Also, if I miss, I'll have to fold to a river bet.\n\nGiven the pot odds and estimated equity, it's a close decision. The 24% equity vs 23% needed suggests a slight call. But there's also the possibility of raising as a semi-bluff. I have 12 outs, which is decent. A raise could fold out weak aces or pairs. But my hand is very weak otherwise, and if called, I'm committed with a draw.\n\nGiven my tournament position (19BB, not super short but not deep), I should be cautious. However, the pot is small relative to stacks. Let me think about stack sizes: I have 155, opponent has 141. If I call, pot becomes 40, and I'll have 143 left. If I raise, minimum raise to 24 (double the bet). That would be 24 total, putting 36 more in (24-8 already in BB?). Wait, I already put in 8 as BB. So I'd need to add 16 more to make it 24 total. Actually, \"raise_to\" is total amount. So if I raise to 24, that means I put 24 total, which is 16 more (since I already have 8 in). That's reasonable.\n\nBut raising commits"

More likely they have a medium pocket pair, a weak ace (A2-A5), or a draw. Their bet of 12 into 28 is small, about 43% pot. This could be a blocking bet with a weak hand or a draw.\n\nMy hand has decent equity with draws. I have position (they acted first on turn). If I call, I get to see river and can evaluate. My stack is 155, so calling 12 is about 8% of my stack. Not huge.\n\nHowever, I should consider implied odds: If I hit my flush or straight, I might get paid more. But my stack is relatively short (19BB), so implied odds are limited. Also, if I miss, I'll have to fold to a river bet.\n\nGiven the pot odds and estimated equity, it's a close decision. The 24% equity vs 23% needed suggests a slight call. But there's also the possibility of raising as a semi-bluff. I have 12 outs, which is decent. A raise could fold out weak aces or pairs. But my hand is very weak otherwise, and if called, I'm committed with a draw.\n\nGiven my tournament position (19BB, not super short but not deep), I should be cautious. However, the pot is small relative to stacks. Let me think about stack sizes: I have 155, opponent has 141. If I call, pot becomes 40, and I'll have 143 left. If I raise, minimum raise to 24 (double the bet). That would be 24 total, putting 36 more in (24-8 already in BB?). Wait, I already put in 8 as BB. So I'd need to add 16 more to make it 24 total. Actually, \"raise_to\" is total amount. So if I raise to 24, that means I put 24 total, which is 16 more (since I already have 8 in). That's reasonable.\n\nBut raising commits",

          "reasoning_content": "Looking at opponent's actions: Kimi-K2 tends to be somewhat passive postflop. They've called bets on flop and turn in hand 30, then checked river. In hand 32, they checked turn and bet small on river (8 into likely small pot). They raised preflop in hands 31, 36, 37. In hand 37, they called flop and turn bets then folded river. So they seem to call with draws or medium strength hands, but fold when they don't improve.\n\nIn this hand, they limped preflop (called SB), which suggests a weak hand. Then they checked flop and bet small on turn (12 into 28). This could be a probe bet with a weak pair or a draw. Given the board A-K-6-3, they might have a weak ace (A2-A5), a small pair (44-99), or a draw like diamonds or a straight draw.\n\nMy hand: 5s2s. I have a flush draw (9 outs) and gutshot straight draw (4 outs, but 4s overlaps). So about 12 outs total. Pot odds: need to call 12 to win 40 (28+12). That's 30% pot odds (12/40=0.3). I need about 30% equity. My estimated equity with 12 outs is about 24% (using rule of 2 for one card). Actually 12 outs is 12/46 \u2248 26%. Close.\n\nBut there's also implied odds if I hit. However, my stack is only 155 (19BB), so implied odds are limited. Also, some of my outs might not be clean: if opponent has a better flush draw (with higher spades), or if the board pairs and they have a set.\n\nGiven the small bet size (43% pot), opponent likely has a weak hand. They might fold to a raise. A semi-bluff raise could work. If I raise to say 36 (triple the bet), that would be 36 total, meaning I put in 28 more (since I already have 8). That would be a significant portion of my stack (28/155 \u2248 18%). If called, I'd have about 127 left with pot of ~76, giving me about 1.7:1 odds on river.\n\nBut raising commits me. Calling seems better: I get to see river with decent equity, and if I miss, I can fold. If I hit, I can bet for value. My position is good (I act last on river).\n\nGiven the close equity and pot odds, and the fact that opponent's bet seems weak, I'll call. It's a small investment (12 chips, 8% of stack) with reasonable chance to improve.\n\nLet me also consider tournament strategy: With 19BB, I'm not in dire need to gamble, but this is a small pot. I should preserve chips for better spots. However, the pot odds justify a call with a draw.\n\nI'll call.",

          "content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nHand: 5s 2s\nBoard: 6s Kc Ad 3d Jh\n\nMy hand is terrible - just 5-high with no pair, no draw. I have a flush draw that missed (only 2 spades on board, I have 2 spades, but board shows 6s, so there's only 1 spade on board actually). Wait, board shows 6s, Kc, Ad, 3d, Jh - so there's exactly one spade (6s). I have 5s 2s, so I have two spades, making a flush draw, but only one spade on board, so no flush.\n\nBest possible hand: 5-high straight? Board is 6-K-A-3-J. For a straight, I'd need 4-5 or 5-7. I have 5-2, so no straight either.\n\nI'm basically playing the board with 5-high. The board shows A-K-J-6-3. So the best hand on board is Ace-high with K kicker.\n\nOpponent (Seat 2) has 117 chips. They bet 12 on turn, now 24 on river. Pot is 64 chips, I need to call 24.\n\nFrom opponent history: They showed K9 in hand #30 and won with two pair. They've been fairly active preflop with some raises. On river bets, I see they bet 8 in hand #32 on river. In hand #37 they folded to a river bet.\n\nLooking at this hand: Preflop they just called SB, I checked BB. Flop checked through. Turn they bet 12 into ~32 pot (8+8+16? Actually: SB 4, BB 8, call 4 = 16 pot preflop). So turn pot was 16, they bet 12 (75% pot). River pot is now 40 (16+12+12), they bet 24 (60% pot).\n\nThis looks like value betting. With board A-K-6-3-J, what hands would they value bet? Possibly A-x, K-x, maybe two pair, maybe even a straight? They could have 45 for straight (4-5 would make straight on turn with 6-3-A-4-5, but board is 6-K-A-3-J, so 45 would make straight on river with 3-4-5-6-7? No, 45 would need 2-3-4-5-6 or 4-5-6-7-8). Actually 45 makes straight with 2-3-4-5-6 or 3-4-5-6-7 or 4-5-6-7-8. Board has 6-3-A-J-K, so no.\n\nWhat about 24 for straight? 2-3-4-5-6? Board has 6-3, so 2-4-5 would make straight. I have 5-2, so they could have 4-2 or 4-5.\n\nBut more likely they have A-x or K-x. They're small blind, so range is wide.\n\nMy hand is basically bluff catcher, but I have the worst possible bluff catcher - 5-high. If they're bluffing, they could have any two cards. But would they bluff this river? Board is fairly dry - A-K high, no flush possible, only straights are 45 or 24.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 24 to win 88 (64+24). That's about 3.7:1 odds, need ~21% equity.\n\nDo I have 21% chance to win? Against a reasonable value range (A-x, K-x, maybe two pair, sets), I have near 0%. Against a bluff range, I have maybe 50% if they have complete air.\n\nBut would they bluff here? They bet turn and river, which looks like value. Bluffs would often give up on river after being called on turn.\n\nAlso tournament considerations: I have 143 chips (17.9 BB). Calling 24 would leave me with 119 chips (14.9 BB). Not a huge difference.\n\nBut this is a terrible spot to call with 5-high. Even if they're bluffing, they could have a better high card like Q-high or 8-high.\n\nI should fold. This is a clear fold. Let me check if there's any history of opponent bluffing rivers. From the data, I see they bet 8 on river in hand #32 and bet this river. Not much data.\n\nBut with my hand strength, it's an easy fold."

They bet 12 on turn, now 24 on river. Pot is 64 chips, I need to call 24.\n\nFrom opponent history: They showed K9 in hand #30 and won with two pair. They've been fairly active preflop with some raises. On river bets, I see they bet 8 in hand #32 on river. In hand #37 they folded to a river bet.\n\nLooking at this hand: Preflop they just called SB, I checked BB. Flop checked through. Turn they bet 12 into ~32 pot (8+8+16? Actually: SB 4, BB 8, call 4 = 16 pot preflop). So turn pot was 16, they bet 12 (75% pot). River pot is now 40 (16+12+12), they bet 24 (60% pot).\n\nThis looks like value betting. With board A-K-6-3-J, what hands would they value bet? Possibly A-x, K-x, maybe two pair, maybe even a straight? They could have 45 for straight (4-5 would make straight on turn with 6-3-A-4-5, but board is 6-K-A-3-J, so 45 would make straight on river with 3-4-5-6-7? No, 45 would need 2-3-4-5-6 or 4-5-6-7-8). Actually 45 makes straight with 2-3-4-5-6 or 3-4-5-6-7 or 4-5-6-7-8. Board has 6-3-A-J-K, so no.\n\nWhat about 24 for straight? 2-3-4-5-6? Board has 6-3, so 2-4-5 would make straight. I have 5-2, so they could have 4-2 or 4-5.\n\nBut more likely they have A-x or K-x. They're small blind, so range is wide.\n\nMy hand is basically bluff catcher, but I have the worst possible bluff catcher - 5-high. If they're bluffing, they could have any two cards. But would they bluff this river? Board is fairly dry - A-K high, no flush possible, only straights are 45 or 24.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 24 to win 88 (64+24). That's about 3.7:1 odds, need ~21% equity.\n\nDo I have 21% chance to win? Against a reasonable value range (A-x, K-x, maybe two pair, sets), I have near 0%. Against a bluff range, I have maybe 50% if they have complete air.\n\nBut would they bluff here? They bet turn and river, which looks like value. Bluffs would often give up on river after being called on turn.\n\nAlso tournament considerations: I have 143 chips (17.9 BB). Calling 24 would leave me with 119 chips (14.9 BB). Not a huge difference.\n\nBut this is a terrible spot to call with 5-high. Even if they're bluffing, they could have a better high card like Q-high or 8-high.\n\nI should fold. This is a clear fold. Let me check if there's any history of opponent bluffing rivers. From the data, I see they bet 8 on river in hand #32 and bet this river. Not much data.\n\nBut with my hand strength, it's an easy fold.",

Also, there are 4 players left to act behind me who could have stronger hands.\n\nMy stack is 18.9 BB, which is getting into push/fold territory, but not quite there yet.

With A6s from UTG, standard tournament strategy would be to fold this hand. It's too weak to open from early position. Even though it's suited, it has reverse implied odds - if I hit an ace, I could be dominated by better aces. Also, there are 4 players left to act behind me who could have stronger hands.\n\nMy stack is 18.9 BB, which is getting into push/fold territory, but not quite there yet.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the button with Qs 5c, which is a marginal hand. My stack is 143 chips (17.9 BB), which is short but not critically short. The opponent in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 16 total (2x BB raise from 8 to 16). Looking at the opponent's history from seat 4: they've been folding a lot preflop (7 folds out of 10 actions), called once, and bet postflop in a couple of hands. They don't seem overly aggressive preflop.\n\nThe pot is currently 28 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 16). I need to call 8 more chips to continue. That's 5.6% of my stack.\n\nFactors to consider:\n1. Hand strength: Q5o is a weak hand. Offsuit with no connectivity. Queen-high is not great.\n2. Position: I'm on the button, which is good position, but against a single raiser.\n3. Stack sizes: I have 143 chips, opponent has 255 chips. If I call, I'll have 135 left after calling (8 chips).\n4. Tournament considerations: With 17.9 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate. I should be looking for better spots.\n5. Pot odds: I need to call 8 to win 28, which is 3.5:1 odds (22% equity needed). Q5o has about 29% equity against a typical raising range, so mathematically it might be a call.\n6. Implied odds: As the button, I have position advantage, but with such a weak hand, I'll likely have to fold to continuation bets unless I hit something good.\n\nHowever, Q5o is a hand that flops poorly - it needs to hit two pair or better to feel comfortable. The queen-high flop can be dominated easily.\n\nLooking at my own history: I've been folding a lot (38 folds out of 45 hands), which suggests I'm playing tight. I won recently with AA from CO.\n\nGiven my short stack and the weak nature of Q5o, I think folding is correct. I should wait for better spots. The 8 chips to call is small, but it's still 5.6% of my stack, and I'll likely have to fold to most flops. Better to preserve my stack for a better hand.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm UTG (under the gun) with AQ offsuit (Qd As). My stack is 139 chips (17.4 BB). Blinds are 4/8. The pot is 12 chips. SB (Seat 5) posted 4, BB (Seat 1) posted 8, and Seat 2 folded. I need to call 8 to play.\n\nLooking at my position: UTG is the worst position preflop - I have to act first after the flop. However, AQ is a strong hand, especially in a tournament with 17.4 BB stack.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see some patterns:\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB) has shown some aggression - in hand 39 they raised from BB with 6d 2d after a limper.\n2. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has raised preflop in recent hands (hands 46 and 48).\n3. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB) has shown some aggression too.\n\nMy stack is 139 chips. If I just call 8, the pot will be 20 chips, and I'll have 131 behind. This is a bit shallow for post-flop play but manageable.\n\nWith AQ UTG, standard play is usually to raise. However, with my stack depth (17.4 BB), I need to consider tournament implications. I'm not super short, but not deep either.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: Too tight for AQ with 17.4 BB\n2. Call: Could be okay but puts me in a tricky spot post-flop OOP\n3. Raise: Standard play with a strong hand\n\nIf I raise, minimum raise is to 16 (double the BB). But a standard raise would be 2.5-3x, so 20-24 chips. My stack is 139, so raising to 24 would commit 17% of my stack preflop.\n\nGiven my position and stack, I think raising is best. I want to take initiative and possibly win the pot preflop. If I get called, I have a strong hand that can flop well.\n\nLet me check if there are any recent hands where players have shown particular tendencies. From hand 39, Kimi-K2 Thinking raised from BB with 62s after a limper, showing they can be aggressive. In hand 44, I raised with AA and everyone folded.\n\nI should raise to around 20-24 chips. Let's say 24 chips (3x BB). This is a standard raise size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"AQo is a strong hand UTG.

I need to call 8 chips or raise to at least 16 total.\n\nFrom opponent history:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): No data, but based on name might be more aggressive/thinking\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has been folding a lot recently (7 straight folds after hand 41)\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has raised twice preflop (hands 46 and 48) and called once\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Raised once preflop (hand 45), otherwise mostly folding\n\nMy own history shows I've been folding a lot (41 folds in 49 hands), but just won hand 49 with AQ from CO.\n\nAJo from UTG is a marginal hand. In tournament poker with 18.9 BB, this is a tricky spot. Standard play with this stack depth is either:\n1. Fold (tight play, preserve stack)\n2. Raise (standard 2.5x-3x)\n3.

I need to call 8 more chips to continue.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot preflop (14 out of 20 recorded actions are folds). They've only called twice and bet once. They showed down Kd 9h in hand #30. Their recent actions show they folded preflop in hands 38-49, then called in hand 50. Now they're raising from SB.\n\nThis could be a steal attempt from SB. With Kh 7s, I have a marginal hand - king-high with weak kicker. However, I'm getting good pot odds: pot is 24 chips (8 from me as BB, 4 from SB, plus 12 more from SB raise), I need to call 8 more. That's 3:1 pot odds (24:8).\n\nMy stack is 143 chips, opponent has 137 chips. If I call, pot will be 32 chips, and effective stack will be ~135 chips behind.\n\nGiven opponent's tight folding tendencies, this raise might be a steal attempt with a wide range. Kh 7s has some value against steal attempts. However, being out of position (they act after me postflop) is a disadvantage.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 17.9 BB, which is getting short but not critical yet. Folding preserves my stack but gives up the pot. Calling could lead to difficult postflop decisions out of position.\n\nLet me check if there are any other relevant patterns. Looking at my own history, I've been folding a lot too (42 folds out of 50 hands). I've won a couple pots with premium hands (AA, AQ).\n\nGiven the pot odds and opponent's likely wide stealing range, I think a call is reasonable. However, Kh 7s is pretty weak. The king is good, but 7 is a terrible kicker. I'll be dominated by any king with better kicker.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The opponent raised from SB after many folds. This could be a sign of strength or a steal. With my stack size, maybe I should 3-bet to apply pressure? Minimum raise to is 24 (total). That would be putting in 16 more chips (24 total). But with Kh 7s, I don't want to play a big pot.\n\nI think the best play is to fold. Kh 7s is too weak to call a raise, even with good pot odds, because I'll be out of position and likely dominated. Folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\nWait, but if this is a steal attempt, I should defend. Let me think about opponent's range. SB raising range could be wide: maybe top 30-40% of hands. Kh 7s is probably around 30-35% percentile. So it's borderline.\n\nGiven tournament dynamics and my position, I'll fold. I need a better hand to continue against a raise, even from SB."

The SB (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) raised to 16 total (which is a min-raise from 8 to 16). I need to call 8 more chips to continue.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot preflop (14 out of 20 recorded actions are folds). They've only called twice and bet once. They showed down Kd 9h in hand #30. Their recent actions show they folded preflop in hands 38-49, then called in hand 50. Now they're raising from SB.\n\nThis could be a steal attempt from SB. With Kh 7s, I have a marginal hand - king-high with weak kicker. However, I'm getting good pot odds: pot is 24 chips (8 from me as BB, 4 from SB, plus 12 more from SB raise), I need to call 8 more. That's 3:1 pot odds (24:8).\n\nMy stack is 143 chips, opponent has 137 chips. If I call, pot will be 32 chips, and effective stack will be ~135 chips behind.\n\nGiven opponent's tight folding tendencies, this raise might be a steal attempt with a wide range. Kh 7s has some value against steal attempts. However, being out of position (they act after me postflop) is a disadvantage.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 17.9 BB, which is getting short but not critical yet. Folding preserves my stack but gives up the pot. Calling could lead to difficult postflop decisions out of position.\n\nLet me check if there are any other relevant patterns. Looking at my own history, I've been folding a lot too (42 folds out of 50 hands). I've won a couple pots with premium hands (AA, AQ).\n\nGiven the pot odds and opponent's likely wide stealing range, I think a call is reasonable. However, Kh 7s is pretty weak. The king is good, but 7 is a terrible kicker. I'll be dominated by any king with better kicker.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The opponent raised from SB after many folds.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 6s 3s - Suited connectors but very low (6-3 suited). This is a weak hand, especially from the small blind.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the small blind, which is a terrible position post-flop. I'll have to act first on every street after the flop.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 139 chips (17.4 BB) - short stacked\n   - Kimi-K2 (raiser) has 137 chips (similar stack)\n   - MiniMax-M2 in BB has 287 chips (deep stack)\n\n4. **Action**: Kimi-K2 raised to 24 total (3x BB). Looking at the opponent history, Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot (14 folds in last 20 actions). They raised last hand (Hand #51) to 16 (2x BB), and now raised to 24 (3x BB). This suggests they might be opening up their raising range, possibly sensing weakness or trying to steal blinds.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 36 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24). I need to call 20 to win 56 (36+20). That's about 1:2.8 pot odds, or about 26% equity needed.\n\n6. **Hand equity**: 6-3 suited against a likely raising range (maybe top 20-30% of hands) has around 25-30% equity preflop. However, position disadvantage reduces this significantly.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 17.4 BB, I'm short but not critically short. I should be looking for better spots, especially since I have position disadvantage.\n\n8. **Potential outcomes**: \n   - If I call, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position with a short stack. \n   - If I raise, I'd be committing a significant portion of my stack with a very weak hand.\n   - The BB (MiniMax-M2) still has to act behind me with a deep stack, which could squeeze.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Hand is very weak (6-3 suited)\n- Terrible position (SB)\n- Short stack but not desperate\n- Pot odds are borderline but position disadvantage makes it worse\n- Opponent has been tight but raised last hand too, possibly expanding range\n\nThis is an easy fold. I should wait for a better spot with better position or a stronger hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"6-3 suited is too weak from SB facing a raise.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm UTG with 8d9d, a suited connector. My stack is 139 chips (17.4 BB). The blinds are 4/8. I'm first to act preflop. Seat 2 has already folded. \n\nFrom my hand history, I've been folding a lot of marginal hands, which makes sense. From opponent data:\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has raised twice preflop (hand 46 and 48) and folded most other times\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, SB) raised once preflop (hand 45) and folded most times\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, BB) raised once preflop (hand 50) and folded most times\n\n8d9s is a speculative hand. Being UTG with a short stack (17.4 BB), I need to be careful. Suited connectors can be playable, but from UTG with this stack size, it's marginal. The pot is 12 chips, and I need to call 8 chips (about 5.8% of my stack).\n\nIf I call, there are 3 players left to act behind me: MiniMax-M2 (MP), GPT-OSS-120B (CO), and Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB). They could raise, which would put me in a tough spot.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy with a short stack, I should either be raising with strong hands or folding marginal ones. 8d9d is not strong enough to open-raise from UTG with 17.4 BB. Calling invites trouble from players behind.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 20 (12 pot + 8 call), which is 2.5:1 or 28.6%. 8d9d has about 20% equity against a random hand, but worse against a raising range. Implied odds could be decent if I hit a strong draw, but with my short stack, I don't have much room to maneuver.\n\nGiven my position and stack size, folding is the prudent play. I should wait for better spots.",

Q9s is not a premium hand, and being in early position makes it even worse.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has raised preflop in 2 of last 10 hands, but mostly folds. Recently has folded 7 straight times.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised once (to 24) in last 10 hands, called once, otherwise mostly folds.\n\nMy own history shows I've been folding a lot (46 folds out of 54 hands, 7 wins). I won hand #49 with AQ from CO position with a raise.\n\nStack sizes: I have 139 chips (17.4 BB), which is relatively short but not critical. Seat 4 has 283 (35 BB), Seat 5 has 258 (32 BB).\n\nWith Q9s from UTG, this is a clear fold in tournament poker. Reasons:\n1. Hand strength is weak - Q9s is not strong enough to open from UTG\n2. Position is terrible - I'll be out of position against all remaining players\n3. Stack preservation - With 17.4 BB, I can't afford to play speculative hands OOP\n4. Better spots - I should wait for better opportunities in later positions\n5. Risk of being 3-bet - Players behind might have stronger ranges\n\nThe pot odds are 8 to call into 12 pot (2:3), but that doesn't justify playing this weak hand OOP.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

That's 3:1 pot odds (25% equity needed).\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 17.4 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate. I need to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n**Decision:**\n- 9d 2s has very little equity even against random hands\n- While position is good, this hand is so weak it's unlikely to improve meaningfully\n- The BB has been folding a lot, but if they do play, they'll likely have a better hand\n- Completing here commits me to playing a terrible hand out of position postflop\n- Better to fold and wait for a better spot\n\nEven though it's only 4 more chips to call, playing "

That's 3:1 pot odds (25% equity needed).\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 17.4 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate. I need to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n**Decision:**\n- 9d 2s has very little equity even against random hands\n- While position is good, this hand is so weak it's unlikely to improve meaningfully\n- The BB has been folding a lot, but if they do play, they'll likely have a better hand\n- Completing here commits me to playing a terrible hand out of position postflop\n- Better to fold and wait for a better spot\n\nEven though it's only 4 more chips to call, playing ",

Even from the button, this hand has very little value. With a small stack of 17.4 BB, I should be looking for better spots. The pot is only 12 chips, and I need to call 8 chips to see a flop. That's 5.8% of my stack for a very marginal hand.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 8 to win 20 (12 pot + 8 call), so 2.5:1 odds. But with K3o, I'm dominated by any hand with a king, and even when I hit a king, my kicker is weak. The reverse implied odds are bad - I could easily lose a lot when I hit top pair with weak kicker.\n\nGiven my stack size and tournament considerations, I should preserve my chips for better opportunities. I've been folding a lot of hands recently (looking at my history), which is reasonable given my stack size and the need to pick good spots.\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger hand or a better situation.

Even if I raise and get folds, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position against potentially strong hands if someone calls.\n\nAlso, Kimi-K2 Thinking in the BB might defend with a decent range given they have 135 chips (16.9 BB). They've shown some aggression with raises in the past.\n\nThe pot is 12 chips, and I need to call 8 to see a flop. That's 5.8% of my stack. While the pot odds are decent (1.5:1), implied odds with Q2s are poor because even if I hit a flush draw or pair, I'll be out of position and the hand is easily dominated.\n\nTournament considerations: With 17.4 BB, I'm in push/fold territory but not quite there yet. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nLooking at my recent hands, I've been folding a lot (folded 49 of 58 hands, won 8). This shows I'm playing tight, which is correct for tournament poker.\n\nBest play here is to fold Q2s from UTG. It's just too weak of a hand to play, especially with tight players behind who might wake up with strong hands.\n\nLet me check if there are any other factors... No, fold is correct."

This hand has almost no value and playing it from early position is a recipe for losing chips.\n\nEven if I call 8 chips, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand with a hand that rarely improves meaningfully. The implied odds are poor because even if I hit something like a pair of 2s or 4s, it's vulnerable and unlikely to win at showdown.\n\nTournament considerations: With 17.4 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. This is not a spot to get involved.\n\nThe pot odds: 8 to call into a pot of 20 (12 + my 8), so I need ~28% equity. 2-4 offsuit has maybe 20% equity against random hands, and worse against the ranges that will continue after UTG call.\n\nGiven all this, folding is the clear and correct play.

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 143, which is effectively an all-in since they have 0 chips? Wait, Seat 1 has 0 chips and is \"out\"? Actually the description says \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 0 chips (out)\". That seems like they're already out of the tournament but still in the hand? That's confusing.\n\nLet me check: Seat 1 has 0 chips but raised 143? That doesn't make sense unless they're all-in with 0? Maybe it's a misprint. Let me re-read: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 0 chips (out)\" - maybe they're eliminated but still showing? The action says \"preflop: Seat 1 raise 143\". If they have 0 chips, they can't raise 143. Something is off.\n\nActually, looking at the stacks: I have 123, Seat 2 has 157 (folded), Seat 4 has 295 (folded), Seat 5 has 258 (folded). Seat 1 has 0 chips but raised? Maybe they're all-in with their last 0? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe \"out\" means they're out of the hand? But then they wouldn't be acting. Or maybe it's a display issue - they have some chips but it shows 0.\n\nLet me think: The pot is 167 chips. Blinds are 8/16. SB posted 8, BB posted 16. That's 24 in the pot. Seat 4 and 5 folded. Then Seat 1 raised to 143. That would put 143 + 24 = 167 pot. Yes, that matches.\n\nBut if Seat 1 has 0 chips, they can't raise. So likely they have chips but it's showing 0 incorrectly, or \"out\" means something else.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide. I have 9d 2s, a terrible hand. I have 123 chips total. I already have 16 in as BB. To call, I need to put in 127 more, which would leave me with 0 (123 - 127 = -4? Actually 123 - 127 = -4, but I can't have negative). Wait, I have 123 total, I already put 16, so I have 107 left. To call 127, I'd need to put all 107 remaining? Let's calculate: My stack: 123 total. I already posted BB of 16, so I have 107 behind. The raise is to 143 total. I need to put in 143 - 16 = 127 more. But I only have 107 behind. So I can call all-in for 107 more. Actually, the amount to call is 127, but I only have 107 behind. So I can go all-in for my remaining 107.\n\nThe pot would then be: My 123 + opponent's 143? Let's think: If I go all-in for 123 total (my stack), opponent raised to 143, but they only need to match my all-in of 123? Actually, in poker, if I go all-in for less than their raise, they only need to call the difference to match my all-in. So if I go all-in for 123 total, they raised to 143, they would get back 20 (143-123=20) as change if they want to just call my all-in.\n\nBut the interface says \"Amount to call: 127\". That suggests I need to put 127 more to call. But I only have 107 behind. So maybe I can call all-in for 107 more, making my total contribution 16 + 107 = 123.\n\nLet me check the pot size: 167 chips. That includes: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 143? Actually 8+16+143=167. Yes.\n\nIf I call all-in for 107 more (total 123), the pot becomes: 167 (current) + 107 (my call) = 274. Opponent has 0 chips? Wait they have 0 chips according to display, but they raised 143. So they must have at least 143 chips. Actually they raised 143, so they have at least 143 chips. But display says 0 chips. This is confusing.\n\nMaybe \"out\" means they're all-in? Like they're \"out\" of chips? But they raised 143, so they had chips.\n\nLet me use tools to get more information about opponents. First, let me recall opponent actions for Seat 1"

My stack is 123 chips (7.7 BB). Pot is 167. Amount to call is 127, but I only have 107 behind (since I already put 16 as BB). So I can call all-in for my remaining 107. The hand is very weak - 9d 2s is one of the worst possible hands. The opponent raised preflop, likely with a strong hand. With my short stack of 7.7 BB, I need to consider tournament survival. But calling with 9d 2s is terrible. Even with pot odds: pot is 167, I need to call 107. That's pot odds of 167:107, or about 1.56:1, meaning I need about 39% equity. 9d 2s has maybe 30% equity against a reasonable raising range. Actually worse. Against a top 20% range, 9d 2s has about 32% equity. So pot odds might justify a call if I think opponent is raising wide. But with my short stack, I should be looking for better spots. However, I'm getting decent pot odds: I'm putting in 107 to win 274 (167 current pot + my 107 call). That's 107 to win 274, or 2.56:1 pot odds. Wait, recalc: If I call all-in for 107 more, total pot would be: 167 (current) + 107 (my call) = 274. I'm contributing 107/274 = 39% of pot, so I need 39% equity. Against a random hand, 9d 2s has about 40% equity. Against a top 50% range, it has about 36%. Against a top 20% range, about 32%. So it's close.\n\nBut I need to consider opponent tendencies. Let me try to use tools quickly, but the system says invalid format. I need to just make a decision. I'll fold. 9d 2s is too weak, and with my short but not desperate stack (7.7 BB), I can wait for a better spot. Folding leaves me with 107 chips (6.7 BB), which is still playable. Calling and losing would eliminate me. So I'll fold.\n\nResponse should be JSON: {\"action\": \"fold\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"brief explanation\"}. Let me provide that.",

Better to preserve stack for better spot.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Wait, I need to understand the situation better. The hand description says Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 0 chips and is \"out\", but then it says \"Seat 2 raise 157\". That seems contradictory. Let me re-read the hand details:\n\n\"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\" - This suggests Seat 2 is out of the tournament (has 0 chips).\n\nBut then in the actions: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 157\"\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps there's a display issue or the player went all-in earlier? Actually, looking at the pot size: 181 chips. That's huge for preflop with blinds 8/16. Let me calculate: SB (8) + BB (16) = 24. But pot is 181. So there must have been a raise already. The actions show: Seat 5 fold, Seat 1 fold, then Seat 2 raise 157. But Seat 2 is listed as having 0 chips.\n\nWait, maybe Seat 2 is actually still in the hand but the stack display is wrong? Or maybe this is a misprint. Let me check the amount to call: 149. My stack is 115. So I can't even call the full amount - I'd be all-in if I call.\n\nActually, I think I understand now. Seat 2 might have gone all-in for their remaining stack of 157 chips (or something like that). The \"0 chips (out)\" might be a display error, or maybe they're all-in.\n\nBut more importantly: I have 2h 5s in the small blind. This is an absolutely terrible hand. I need to call 149 chips with only 115 total. If I call, I'm all-in for my entire stack with 2h 5s against what's likely a strong hand given the raise.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: Pot is 181 chips currently. I need to call 149 (but actually I only have 115, so I'd be all-in for 115). So pot odds are roughly 181:115 or about 1.57:1. I need about 39% equity to call.\n\nWith 2h 5s against a typical raising range, my equity is terrible. Even against a wide range like any two cards above 8, my equity is maybe 30-35%. Against a reasonable range, it's worse.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 115 chips (7.2 BB). That's very short stacked. But going all-in with 2h 5s is terrible. I should wait for a better spot.\n\nPosition: I'm in the small blind. After me is the big blind who has 279 chips. They still have to act. Even if I call, they might raise or call.\n\nGiven how terrible my hand is, I should fold. But wait, let me check if Seat 2 is actually all-in. If they're all-in and I call, it would be heads-up against them. But still, with 2h5s, it's a terrible hand.\n\nActually, looking at the recall_opponent_actions: Seat 2 has been folding a lot recently (hands 53-61 all folds). But earlier they raised in hands 51 and 52. So they might be getting desperate or changing strategy.\n\nBut regardless, 2h5s is one of the worst possible hands. Even with pot odds, it's a fold.\n\nLet me also check my own history: I've been folding a lot too. My win rate is 13%. I'm short stacked. But going all-in with 2h5s is not the way to double up.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Seat 4 (SB) is MiniMax-M2 with 271 chips, Seat 5 (BB) is GPT-OSS-120B with 242 chips.\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has been folding a lot preflop (7 of last 10 hands folded). Only called once from SB (hand 59) and then bet turn. Seems fairly tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Also folding a lot preflop (9 of last 10 hands folded). Only called once as BB (hand 54). Also seems tight.\n\nMy hand history shows I've been folding a lot too (win rate 12.9%, 8 wins in 62 hands). I have 7.2 BB stack, which is short-stacked. A5s is a decent hand from the button, especially against tight blinds.\n\nWith my stack size, I should be looking to push all-in or raise. A5s has good playability postflop but with only 7.2 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. The pot is 24 chips (8 SB + 16 BB). If I call 16, I'll have 99 chips left (6.2 BB) and will be out of position postflop.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy for short stacks: With 7.2 BB, I should be shoving a wide range from the button against tight blinds. A5s is definitely in that range. The blinds have been folding a lot, so they might fold to a shove.\n\nIf I shove all-in for 115 total (99 more), they need to call 99 into a pot of 139 (24 + 115). They need ~41% equity to call. They might fold marginal hands.\n\nIf they call, A5s has decent equity against many hands. Against a random hand, A5s has ~56% equity. Against a calling range of pairs 22+, A5o+, KQo+, KJs+, it has ~38% equity.\n\nGiven my stack size and position, shoving seems optimal. Calling is bad because I'll be out of position with a weak hand postflop with a short stack.\n\nLet me calculate: If I shove 115, SB needs to call 107 (115 - 8 already posted) into pot of 139, needs 43% equity. BB needs to call 99 into pot of 139, needs 41% equity.\n\nI'll go all-in."

Both players folded to me, so I'm facing just the blinds. Seat 4 (SB) is MiniMax-M2 with 271 chips, Seat 5 (BB) is GPT-OSS-120B with 242 chips.\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has been folding a lot preflop (7 of last 10 hands folded). Only called once from SB (hand 59) and then bet turn. Seems fairly tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Also folding a lot preflop (9 of last 10 hands folded). Only called once as BB (hand 54). Also seems tight.\n\nMy hand history shows I've been folding a lot too (win rate 12.9%, 8 wins in 62 hands). I have 7.2 BB stack, which is short-stacked. A5s is a decent hand from the button, especially against tight blinds.\n\nWith my stack size, I should be looking to push all-in or raise. A5s has good playability postflop but with only 7.2 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. The pot is 24 chips (8 SB + 16 BB). If I call 16, I'll have 99 chips left (6.2 BB) and will be out of position postflop.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy for short stacks: With 7.2 BB, I should be shoving a wide range from the button against tight blinds. A5s is definitely in that range. The blinds have been folding a lot, so they might fold to a shove.\n\nIf I shove all-in for 115 total (99 more), they need to call 99 into a pot of 139 (24 + 115). They need ~41% equity to call. They might fold marginal hands.\n\nIf they call, A5s has decent equity against many hands. Against a random hand, A5s has ~56% equity. Against a calling range of pairs 22+, A5o+, KQo+, KJs+, it has ~38% equity.\n\nGiven my stack size and position, shoving seems optimal. Calling is bad because I'll be out of position with a weak hand postflop with a short stack.\n\nLet me calculate: If I shove 115, SB needs to call 107 (115 - 8 already posted) into pot of 139, needs 43% equity. BB needs to call 99 into pot of 139, needs 41% equity.\n\nI'll go all-in.",

This is their first raise in the recent hands I can see. They showed Jc Tc in a showdown at hand #12.\n\n**My Hand Strength:**\n2d 6h is one of the worst possible hands - no connectivity, no suitedness, low cards. This is a clear fold in almost all situations.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have 7.7 BB, which is very short-stacked. However, 2d6o is just too weak to play from any position, even on the button. With such a short stack, I should be looking for better spots to go all-in or double up.\n\n**Position:**\nBeing on the button is good, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nI need to call 32 to win 72, which gives me 2.25:1 pot odds. However, my hand equity against a typical raising range is probably around 25-30% at best, so I'm not getting the right implied odds.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is an easy fold. 2d 6h is unplayable even with good pot odds. I should preserve my stack for a better spot. With 7.7 BB, I can wait for a better hand to go all-in.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2d6o is unplayable even on button with 7.7 BB.

That's interesting - they're showing some aggression.\n\nMy hand: Th8h suited is a decent speculative hand from the button, especially against just the big blind. It has good implied odds if I hit a flush or straight. With my short stack (7.2 BB), I need to be careful about committing too much.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 into a pot of 24, so I'm getting 3:1 odds. That's good.\n\nPosition: I'm on the button, which is great - I'll have position postflop.\n\nStack preservation: At 7.2 BB, I'm getting short but not critically short yet. I can wait for a better spot, but Th8s on the button against one opponent is a reasonable hand.\n\nOpponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot but just showed aggression. They might be getting tired of being folded around. If I raise, they might defend with a wide range.\n\nIf I call, I'll have 107 chips left for postflop play (115 - 8). The pot will be 32. If I raise, minimum raise is to 32 total (adding 24 more). That would leave me with 83 chips, which is about half my stack. That's committing a lot with a speculative hand.\n\nGiven my short stack and the good pot odds, I think calling is reasonable. I get to see a flop cheaply with a hand that can make strong draws. If I miss completely, I can fold. If I hit a good draw or pair, I can continue.\n\nActually, wait - I already have 8 chips in from the SB. So I need to call 8 more to make it 16 total. That's correct.\n\nLet me check: I posted SB 8, BB posted 16. Pot is 24. I need to call 8 to match the BB. Yes.\n\nI think calling is the best play here. Raising commits too much of my stack with a speculative hand. Folding is too tight given the good pot odds and position.\n\nLet me also consider that if I call, the BB might check a lot of flops, allowing me to see a free turn or take it down with a bet if I hit something.\n\nI'll call.",

Better",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand:**\n- My cards: Th 8h (ten of hearts, eight of hearts)\n- Board: Ks Jh 9c Jd\n- My stack: 107 chips (6.7 BB)\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- Position: BTN (button)\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, BB) with 279 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have Th8h on a board of Ks Jh 9c Jd. This gives me:\n- Open-ended straight draw: I need a Q for a straight (Q-T-9-8-7), but wait, actually looking at the board: Ks Jh 9c Jd. With Th8h, I have 10-8. For a straight, I'd need Q-10-9-8-7 or 10-9-8-7-6. So I need a 7 or Q for a straight. Actually, I have an inside straight draw - I need a Q for Q-J-10-9-8 (using the 9 and J on board) or a 7 for 10-9-8-7-6 (using the 9 on board). So it's an inside straight draw, not open-ended.\n- Flush draw: I have two hearts, but only one heart on board (Jh). So I have a backdoor flush draw.\n- Pair potential: I could hit a ten or eight for a pair.\n- The board has two jacks, so someone could have trips or full house.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the opponent history, MiniMax-M2 seems to fold a lot preflop (13 of 20 actions were folds). In hand #59, they called from BB, checked flop, then bet 8 on turn. In hand #66, they raised to 48 preflop. They seem somewhat passive but capable of betting.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have only 6.7 BB, which is critically short. I need to accumulate chips soon. The pot is 32 chips, about 30% of my stack.\n\n**Current situation:**\nWe're on the turn. Both checked flop. I'm first to act on turn. I have 0 to call, so I can check or raise.\n\n**Possible actions:**\n1. Check: See a free river card. This is safe but gives up potential fold equity.\n2. Bet/raise: I could try to take the pot down now with a bet. With my short stack, I need to accumulate chips. A bet might get a fold from hands like weak kings, weak pairs, or draws.\n\nGiven my short stack and the fact that I have some equity (inside straight draw, backdoor flush, pair outs), I think a bet could be good. If I bet something like 16-24 chips (half to 3/4 pot), I put pressure on opponent. If they fold, I win 32 chips, increasing my stack by 30%. If they call, I still have equity.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful because the board has two jacks, so opponent could have trips. But they checked flop, which suggests they might not have a strong jack.\n\nLet me think about hand ranges. Opponent is BB, they could have a wide range. They checked flop, so likely not a strong hand. They could have a weak king, a jack, a nine, a draw, or air.\n\nMy bet sizing: I have 107 total. If I bet 16 (minimum raise), that's 15% of my stack. If I bet 24 (3/4 pot), that's 22% of my stack. Either is reasonable.\n\nGiven my desperate stack situation, I think betting is better than checking. I need to accumulate chips. Checking gives a free card and I might face a river bet.\n\nI'll go with a bet of 16 chips (half pot). This is enough to put pressure while not committing too much.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"With critically short stack (6.7 BB), need to accumulate chips.

My stack is 107 chips (6.7 BB). Pot is 32 chips. Opponent in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 279 chips. They checked the flop after I checked.\n\nFrom opponent data: They've been folding a lot recently (hands 60-65), but in hand 66 they raised preflop to 48. In hand 59, they bet 8 on turn after checking flop. They seem somewhat tight but capable of aggression.\n\nMy stack is critical - only 6.7 BB. I need to accumulate chips. The board is paired with Js, which reduces the chance opponent has a strong hand. My hand has some equity: gutshot to straight (4 outs) and backdoor flush. If I bet now, I might take down the pot with a semi-bluff.\n\nHowever, I should consider that opponent checked flop, which could indicate weakness. A small bet could work. But I have position (button) and can see river action.\n\nActually, looking at pot size: 32 chips. My stack 107. If I bet 16 (minimum raise), that's committing 15% of my stack. If I get called, I'll have 91 left on river with 64 pot. That's okay.\n\nBut maybe better to check and see a free river? If I check, I get to see river for free. If I hit my draw, I can bet. If I miss, I can check-fold.\n\nGiven my short stack, I need to accumulate chips. A semi-bluff might be good. But opponent has shown some aggression (hand 66 raise, hand 59 turn bet). If they have a J, they'd likely bet flop. Board is Ks Jh 9c Jd - possible they have Kx, 9x, or pocket pair.\n\nI think a small bet is good. Let's bet 24 (3/4 pot). That puts pressure. If called, I still have equity. If raised, I can fold.\n\nWait, legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to: 16. So I can raise to any amount from 16 up to my stack.\n\nI'll bet 24. That's aggressive but not all-in. If opponent calls, pot will be 80, I'll have 83 left. Good.\n\nActually, reconsider: If I bet and get called, I'm pot committed on river. But that's okay if I have equity.\n\nBetter to go all-in? No, that's too much with just a draw. 24 is good.\n\nLet's do it.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI have pocket Kings (Kc Kd) on the button with 139 chips (8.7 BB). This is an excellent starting hand - one of the best in poker. The blinds are 8/16, and two players have already folded. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted the small blind (8 chips), and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted the big blind (16 chips).\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has been mostly folding preflop, but raised once to 48 chips in hand #66. They have 271 chips.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been folding a lot preflop, called once from BB in hand #64, then bet 80 on flop. They have 242 chips.\n\nI'm on the button, which is the best position. With pocket Kings, I definitely want to raise. The minimum raise is to 32 chips, but I should consider a larger raise given my stack size and the strength of my hand.\n\nMy stack is 139 chips (8.7 BB). A standard raise would be 3-4x BB, which would be 48-64 chips. However, given that I'm short-stacked and want to build the pot with a premium hand, I should consider a larger raise or even going all-in.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n1. Call (16 chips): Too passive with KK. I want to build the pot.\n2. Minimum raise to 32 chips: Still a bit small. Might encourage calls from speculative hands.\n3. Raise larger: Better to charge draws and build pot.\n4. All-in (139 chips): With 8.7 BB, this is reasonable. Protects my hand and maximizes fold equity.\n\nConsidering I have only 8.7 BB, going all-in is actually quite reasonable. Pocket Kings is a hand I'm willing to get all-in with preflop. If I get called, I'm likely ahead unless someone has Aces.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that the opponents have been folding a lot. A standard raise might get them to fold, while an all-in might look too strong and get folds too. But with KK, I want action.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: If I raise to say 48-64 chips (3-4x BB), that leaves me with 75-91 chips behind, which is 4.7-5.7 BB. That's still a commitment to the hand. If I get called and miss the flop, I'll have to decide whether to continue.\n\nGiven my short stack, I think a larger raise or all-in is best. Let me go with a raise to 80 chips (5x BB). This is a strong raise that should get respect, builds the pot nicely, and leaves me with 59 chips behind (3.7 BB) for post-flop play if needed.\n\nActually, wait - I need to check the raise amount. The minimum raise is to 32 (16 + 16 more). I can raise to any amount up to my stack of 139. 80 chips would be a raise of 64 chips over the BB (16 + 64 = 80).\n\nYes, raise to 80 seems good. It's strong but not necessarily all-in, which might get more calls from worse hands.",

Let me check the numbers again.\n\nMy stack: 59 chips\nPreflop: I raised to 80? That seems impossible if I only have 59. Maybe the raise amount is the total put in? Let me think: blinds are 8/16. Seat 4 posted SB 8, Seat 5 posted BB 16. Then I raised 80. That would be 80 total, meaning I put in 80 more than the BB? Actually \"raise 80\" likely means I raised to 80 total. Starting from 0, I put in 80. That would be an all-in since I only have 59. But the action says I raised 80, not all-in. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes: I have 59 chips. The pot is 304 chips. Preflop action: Seat 4 posted SB 8, Seat 5 posted BB 16, then I raised 80. If I raised to 80 total, that means I put in 80 chips. But I only have 59, so I must have gone all-in. The system might show the raise amount as the total. But then Seat 4 called 72 (meaning they had to call 72 more to match my 80, since they already put in 8). Seat 5 called 64 (they had to call 64 more to match my 80, since they already put in 16).\n\nSo I effectively went all-in preflop with 59 chips. But wait, the flop action shows Seat 4 check and Seat 5 bet 64. How can there be a flop if I went all-in preflop? Unless the all-in wasn't called? Actually, both called, so the flop should be dealt with me all-in. But the system is asking me for a flop decision. This is confusing.\n\nLet me check: My stack is 59. I raised to 80 total. That means I put in 80, which is more than my stack. So I'm all-in. But the action continues to flop with me having to act? Maybe the raise was to 80 but I only had 59, so it was effectively all-in, but the system still shows me as having to act on flop because there are side pots? Actually, if I'm all-in for 59, and others called more, there would be a side pot. But I shouldn't have to act on flop if I'm all-in.\n\nWait, maybe I misread: \"Your Stack: 59 chips (3.7 BB)\". That's current stack. But maybe I started with more and the 59 is what's left after preflop? No, the action shows I raised 80 preflop. If I had more than 80 initially, I'd have leftover chips. But it says my stack is 59 now. So maybe I started with 139 chips? 139 - 80 = 59. That makes sense! I started with 139 chips, raised to 80 (put in 80), leaving 59 behind. So I'm not all-in.\n\nYes, that must be it: I have 59 chips remaining after my preflop raise of 80. So total I've put in 80, have 59 left. The pot is 304 chips (8+16+80+72+64 = 240?

Difference of 64. Maybe there's a mistake or there are antes.\n\nAnyway, on flop: Board Tc 7s 9h. Seat 4 checks. Seat 5 bets 64. I need to call 64. I have 59 chips left.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I have KK on a Tc 7s 9h board. This is a good flop for my hand - no overcards, only straight draws possible (J8, 86). Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) bet 64 into a 304 pot. I have 59 chips left, so calling would put me all-in.\n\nLooking at Seat 5's history: they've been folding a lot preflop, but in hand 64 they called a small bet (8) then bet 80 on flop. They seem to bet when they hit something. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been folding a lot, but raised once preflop in hand 66 to 48. They called my preflop raise this hand.\n\nThe bet of 64 into 304 is about 21% of the pot. That's a small bet, which could be a probe bet or a draw. With KK, I'm ahead of most hands: pairs below KK, draws, maybe AT, maybe a set. Sets (TT, 77, 99) are possible but less likely.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 64 to win 304+64 = 368. That's 64/368 = 17.4% equity needed. With KK on this board, I have much more than 17.4% equity against most ranges.\n\nBut I only have 59 chips left. Actually, I need to call 64 but only have 59, so I'd be all-in for my remaining 59. The bet is 64, but I can only call 59. So effective call is 59. Pot would be 304 + 64 (Seat 5's bet) + 59 (my call) = 427. I'm putting in 59 to win 427, needing 59/427 = 13.8% equity.\n\nEven if Seat 4 calls behind (they have 199 chips), the pot gets bigger but my equity requirement stays about the same.\n\nWith KK on this board, I have to go all-in. Folding KK here would be terrible. Even if I'm up against a set, I have outs (two kings, backdoor straight/flush unlikely). But more likely I'm ahead against one pair hands or draws.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm short stacked with 59 chips (3.7 BB). This is a great spot to double up with KK. Even if I lose, I'm almost out anyway.\n\nI should call all-in. My legal actions are fold or call (can't raise). So I'll call.\n\nWait, but Seat 4 is still to act after me. They might raise. But if they raise, I'm already all-in, so it doesn't matter.\n\nDecision: Call all-in with KK on Tc 7s 9h board.",

It plays well multi-way but I'm facing a raise from early position (seat 2 appears to be UTG+1 or MP).\n\nOpponent tendencies: From the limited data, seat 2 folded preflop in hand #1.

JTs against a reasonable UTG raising range (say top 15%: 77+, A9s+, KTs+, QTs+, JTs, ATo+, KQo) has about 38% equity, which is slightly above the break-even point.\n\nHowever, position is terrible. I'll be out of position for the entire hand, which significantly reduces my implied odds and makes the hand harder to play.\n\nTournament considerations: Early in tournament with deep stacks (100 BB). No need to take marginal spots out of position.\n\nBetter to fold here and wait for better spots, especially in better position.

I have to act after SB (MiniMax-M2) posted 1 and BB (GPT-OSS-120B) posted 2. Amount to call is 2.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand Strength**: A8o is a marginal hand from early positions but much more playable from the button. Having an Ace is good, but 8 is a weak kicker. This is a steal opportunity from the button.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is huge advantage - I get to act last on every subsequent street.\n3. **Opponents**: SB (MiniMax-M2) and BB (GPT-OSS-120B) - I don't have much history on them. In hand #1, MiniMax-M2 folded from BB with 99 (pocket nines) when facing no action, which seems tight. In hand #2, they folded from SB after a raise. GPT-OSS-120B folded from BB in hand #1 and folded from UTG in hand #2.\n4. **Stack Sizes**: Everyone has similar stacks (197-202 chips). No short stacks.\n5. **Tournament**: Early stage with 100 BB stacks. Can be more aggressive with position.\n\n**Options**:\n- **Fold**: Too tight. Giving up the button with A8o when everyone folded to me is too passive.\n- **Call**: Just calling 2 to see a flop. Okay option but doesn't put pressure on blinds.\n- **Raise**: Best option. Standard button raise to 4-6 BB (8-12 chips). I should raise to take initiative and potentially win the blinds.\n\nGiven the information, I should make a standard button raise. Let's raise to 10 chips (5x BB), which is a reasonable size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 10,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A8o is playable from the button with everyone folded.

The flop is 3\u26607\u26637\u2660. The opponent bets 15 into a pot of 36. I need to call 15 to win a pot of 51 (36+15). That's pot odds of 15/51 \u2248 29.4%.\n\nMy hand: Ace-high with backdoor flush draw (spades) and backdoor straight potential. The board is paired with 7s, which is concerning. The opponent could have a 7, a pocket pair, or be bluffing. Since I raised preflop, my range looks strong, but A8o is not a great hand on this board.\n\nThe opponent's bet is about 42% of the pot. This could be a probe bet with a weak hand, a value bet with a 7 or pocket pair, or a bluff. Without much history on this opponent (they folded their first two hands), it's hard to read tendencies.\n\nMy position is good (button), but my hand is weak. I have 190 chips total. Calling 15 would leave me with 175. If I call and miss turn, I could face another bet.\n\nBackdoor flush draw: I need runner-runner spades (turn and river both spades). That's about 4% chance. Backdoor straight: I need 6-9 or 9-J on turn and river, also low probability.\n\nGiven the pot odds of 29%, I need about 29% equity to call. Against a reasonable range, A8o on 3\u26607\u26637\u2660 probably has less than 29% equity. Even if opponent is bluffing with hands like 65, 54, etc., I'm only ahead of complete air.\n\nConsidering tournament implications: I have 95 BB, which is healthy. No need to take marginal spots. The paired board makes it less likely my Ace-high is good.\n\nHowever, I'm in position, which gives me some leverage. If I call, I can see a turn card and potentially take it away if opponent checks. But the bet size suggests strength.\n\nLet me think about raising. A raise to 30-40 could take it down now if opponent is bluffing. But if they have a 7 or pocket pair, they'll likely call or re-raise. My hand doesn't have much fold equity since I'm representing a narrow range (overpairs, 7x). Would opponent believe I have a 7 after raising preflop? Possibly A7s, 77, but those are rare.\n\nActually, wait. I should consider that I raised preflop from button. My range could include many hands. The opponent called from BB, so their range is wide. They could have many weak hands that missed this flop.\n\nThe flop is dry except for the pair. Many hands missed. My Ace-high might actually be the best hand if opponent has something like KQ, QJ, JT, T9, etc. But would they bet those? Possibly as a bluff.\n\nGiven the lack of history, I think folding is reasonable. But let me consider the pot odds more carefully. If I think I have 30% equity or more, I should call. Against a range of: all pairs 22-AA, all 7x, all Broadway cards, maybe I have around 25-30% equity. Hard to say.\n\nActually, I should call. Reasons: 1) Position advantage, 2) Ace-high could be best, 3) Backdoor draws, 4) Pot odds are decent, 5) If turn checks, I can bluff. 6) Opponent might be betting weak.\n\nBut the paired board is concerning. If opponent has any 7, I'm drawing nearly dead. If they have a pocket pair above 7, I'm behind. Only beating complete bluffs.\n\nI think I'll call and re-evaluate turn. If turn is an Ace, I improve. If turn is a spade, I get flush draw. If turn blanks, and opponent bets again, I can fold.\n\nActually, let me check: pot is 36, bet 15, call 15. Total pot after call: 51. I need 29% equity. Against a range of: all pocket pairs 22-AA, all 7x suited, A7s, K7s, Q7s, J7s, T7s, 97s, 87s, 76s, 75s, 74s, 73s, 72s, and some Broadway hands (maybe 20% of them as bluffs)... Let me estimate.\n\nActually, I think fold is better. The paired board reduces"

BB caller vs BTN raiser often has a wide range. The flop is paired with 7s, which hits some of their calling range (suited 7x, pocket pairs). But many hands miss completely.\n\nMy A\u26638\u2660 has some showdown value if it's ace-high. The backdoor flush and straight draws add a little equity. Pot odds: 15 to win 51 (29.4%).

My A8 likely has 25-35% equity depending on how often they're bluffing.\n\nPosition is key. If I call, I get to see turn in position. If turn checks, I can often take it down with a bet. If turn is an A or spade, I improve.\n\nStack sizes: I have 190, opponent 175. If I call, pot becomes 51, effective stacks ~160. Good SPR for future streets.\n\nGiven this is early in tournament and I have 95 BB, I can afford to take a speculative call. Folding is too tight. Raising seems bad because my hand has little equity when called, and I don't want to bloat pot with weak hand.\n\nI'll call.",

Turn is 6c (completing the board to 3s7c7s6c - wait, the board shows 3s 7c 7s 6c, so flop was 3s 7c 7s, turn is 6c). So board is paired 7s with straight draws possible (4-5-6-7-8 or 5-6-7-8-9). I have Ace high with backdoor flush draw (spades) and gutshot straight draw (I need a 5 for 4-5-6-7-8 straight? Actually with A-8, I have 4-5-6-7-8 straight if I hit a 5, or 5-6-7-8-9 if I hit a 9). Actually, board is 3s 7c 7s 6c. Straight possibilities: 4-5-6-7-8 (needs 4 and 5), 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 5, 8, 9). I have an 8, so I need 5 and 9 for straight? Let me think: With my A8, I have 8. Board has 3,7,7,6. Possible straights: 3-4-5-6-7 (needs 4,5), 4-5-6-7-8 (needs 4,5,8 - I have 8), 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 5,8,9 - I have 8), 6-7-8-9-T (needs 8,9,T - I have 8). So I have gutshot to straight if I hit a 5 (for 4-5-6-7-8) or 9 (for 5-6-7-8-9) or T (for 6-7-8-9-T). Actually, hitting a 5 gives me 4-5-6-7-8 straight (I have 8, board has 6,7,7,3, I'd need 4 and 5). Wait, that's two cards. Actually, with one card to come (river), I need a single card to complete a straight. What single card gives me a straight? Board: 3,6,7,7. My hand: A,8. Possible straights with one card: \n- 4 gives me 3-4-5-6-7? No, that's 3-4-5-6-7 but I have A,8 not 5.\n- 5 gives me 4-5-6-7-8? I have 8, board has 6,7,7,3. Need 4 and 5. Not one card.\n- 9 gives me 5-6-7-8-9? Need 5,6,7,8,9. I have 8, board has 6,7,7,3. Need 5 and 9. Not one card.\n- T gives me 6-7-8-9-T? Need 6,7,8,9,T. I have 8, board has 6,7,7,3. Need 9 and T.\n\nSo actually, I don't have a straight draw with one card to come. I have Ace high with backdoor flush draw (spades). I need a spade on river for flush draw? Actually, board has 3s and 7s, I have Ac8s, so I have two spades, board has two spades, so I need one more spade for flush. That's 9 outs (13 spades total - 2 on board - 2 in my hand = 9, but some might be dead). Approximately 9 outs, ~18% chance.\n\nOpponent bet 30 into pot of 81. Pot is now 81+30 = 111, I need to call 30, so pot odds are 30/141 = ~21% (actually 30/(111+30)=30/141=21.3%). My equity is around 18% if I have flush draw, but I might have some additional equity if Ace is good (unlikely). So pot odds are slightly worse than needed.\n\nBut I need to consider implied odds if I hit flush. Also opponent tendencies. Let me recall opponent actions. Use tool"

Opponent in BB called preflop, then donk bet flop 15 into ~21 pot? Actually preflop: I raised to 10, BB called 8 more, pot was 1+2+10+8=21. Flop: BB bet 15 into 21, I called. Turn: pot is 21+15+15=51? Wait: flop pot was 21, BB bet 15, I called 15, so pot after flop = 21+15+15=51. Turn: BB bets 30 into 51, making pot 81, I need to call 30.\n\nMy stack: 175. After calling, I'd have 145 left. Pot would be 111. If I hit flush on river, I might get more chips.\n\nOpponent tendencies: From limited data, opponent has folded both previous hands preflop. No postflop history. This is first hand they've played postflop. They called preflop from BB, then donk bet flop and turn. Could have a 7 (trips), a straight draw, a flush draw, or maybe a pair like 6x. Board is paired with 7s, so trips are possible. They might have 7x, 66, 33, or a draw.\n\nMy hand: Ace high with flush draw. I have 9 spade outs (13 total - 2 board - 2 hand = 9). Some spades might give opponent full house if they have 7x with spade? Unlikely. My equity: ~18% to hit flush by river. Pot odds: need to call 30 to win 111+30=141, so 30/141=21.3%. Slightly negative immediate odds.\n\nBut implied odds: If I hit flush, I might get paid on river. My stack is 145 after call, pot would be 111. If I bet 50-100 on river and get called, that's good. However, if opponent has a 7 (trips), they might have redraw to full house if board pairs. Also, if opponent has flush draw too (unlikely since board has two spades, they might have spade draw), we could be drawing to same flush.\n\nAlso, I have position (BTN). I can see river for free if I call turn. If I miss river, I can check-fold.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 87.5BB, healthy stack. Opponent has 145 chips (72.5BB). Not desperate.\n\nDecision: Fold or call? Raise seems bad with just draw. Could semi-bluff raise, but opponent has shown strength with donk bet flop and turn. They likely have something. Raising might get them to fold weaker hands, but they might call or shove with strong hand.\n\nGiven pot odds are close (21% needed, ~18% equity), and implied odds if I hit flush, I could call. But need to consider reverse implied odds: if I hit Ace, might not be good; if I hit flush but board pairs, could lose to full house.\n\nAlso, I might have some fold equity if I raise, but with only 9 clean outs, not great.\n\nBetter to fold? Let's think: I'm getting almost correct odds. If I assume I have 9 outs, that's 9/46 = 19.6% (actually 9/46 = 19.57%). Close to 21.3% needed. If I include Ace as maybe 3 outs (but Ace might not be good), that's 12/46 = 26%. But Ace likely not good if opponent has 7 or pair.\n\nAlso, opponent might fold to raise if they have draw. But they bet flop and turn, seems strong.\n\nI think fold is reasonable. But let's consider: I have position, and calling 30 to potentially win big if I hit flush. However, stack sizes: after calling, I have 145, pot 111. If I hit flush, I can bet maybe 50-100 and get called by trips. Good implied odds.\n\nBut also, opponent might have flush draw too (with spades). Then we split or I lose if they have higher flush. They could have AsXs for nut flush draw. But they called from BB, could have many spade hands.\n\nActually, they called from BB preflop. Range includes many hands: suited connectors, small pairs, broadways. They donk bet flop and turn. This often indicates strong hand like trips or strong draw.\n\nI think I should fold. Pot odds not quite there, and reverse implied risks.\n\nBut wait, I"

          "reasoning_content": "I need to provide a JSON response. Let me structure my decision.\n\nAction options: fold, call, raise. I'm considering fold vs call. Raise seems too aggressive with just a draw against a player showing strength.\n\nPot: 81, bet 30 to call. Pot odds: 30/(81+30+30) = 30/141 = 21.3%. My equity with flush draw: 9 outs, 9/46 = 19.6%. Slightly negative immediate odds. Implied odds: if I hit flush on river, I could get paid maybe 50-100 more chips. But opponent might also have flush draw or full house redraw. Position helps.\n\nStack sizes: I have 175, opponent 145. If I call, I have 145 left, pot 111. If I hit flush, I can bet maybe 50-100. Good implied odds.\n\nBut opponent's line: called preflop from BB, donk bet flop and turn. This often indicates a strong hand like trips (7x), maybe two pair (76s), or a draw. Since board is paired with 7s, trips are likely. They might have 7x, 66, 33. 66 makes full house already. 33 makes full house. But they bet flop and turn, could be 7x. If they have 7x, they have redraw to full house if board pairs. If I hit flush but board pairs, I lose.\n\nAlso, they might have flush draw themselves. As BB caller, could have suited spades. Then my flush draw is not nut (I have Ac8s, Ace high flush if I hit, but if they have Ks or Qs, they might have higher flush draw). Actually, I have Ace of clubs, not spades. Wait: my cards: Ac 8s. I have 8 of spades, Ace of clubs. So I have 8s, board has 3s and 7s. So I have 8 of spades, need one more spade for flush. My flush would be 8-high flush if no higher spades on board. That's weak. Opponent could have higher spade. So my flush might not be good even if I hit. That's a big concern.\n\nActually, board has 3s and 7s. If river is spade, flush possible. My 8-high flush is weak. Opponent could have 9s, Ts, Js, Qs, Ks, As (though As is less likely since I have Ac). But they could have any spade higher than 8. That's many combos. So my flush might be second best.\n\nGiven that, my equity is worse. Maybe only 6-7 outs if some spades give opponent better flush. Plus Ace outs maybe not good.\n\nThus, fold seems best.\n\nI'll fold. Reasoning: Ace-high with weak flush draw (8-high) facing turn bet on paired board. Pot odds not favorable given weak draw and risk of being outflushed. Opponent's line suggests strong hand. Better to preserve stack.\n\nJSON: {\"action\": \"fold\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"Ace-high with weak 8-high flush draw facing turn bet on paired board.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have information about the opponent and my history. Looking at the opponent's actions: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has folded preflop in 4 of 5 hands, checked once in BB, and made one continuation bet on the flop in hand #4. This is their first preflop raise in the observed hands, suggesting they might have a decent hand.\n\nMy hand is 2h 4d, which is one of the worst possible starting hands in poker. It's unsuited, unconnected, and low cards. Even with the BB discount (I already have 2 chips in), calling 6 more chips with 24o is generally -EV.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 6 to win 11 (current pot). That's about 1.83:1 odds, meaning I need ~35% equity. 24o has nowhere near that against any reasonable raising range.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 86.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to gamble with trash hands. Folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\nThe opponent's raise size is 4x BB, which is a bit larger than standard, possibly indicating strength.\n\nGiven all this, folding is clearly the correct play. Let me check if there are any other factors - maybe the opponent is opening wide from UTG? They're in Seat 1, which appears to be UTG position. A raise from UTG with 24o in the BB is an easy fold.\n\nI should also consider that I'm getting closing action - everyone else has folded, so it's heads-up. But even heads-up, 24o is terrible.\n\nThe only reason to continue would be if I thought I could outplay postflop, but with such a weak hand and position disadvantage (I'll be out of position), it's not worth it.\n\nI'll fold.",

Ace-rag offsuit is not great, especially out of position. However, I have an ace which blocks some strong ace hands.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 5 chips to win a pot of 14 chips (9 current + 5 my call).

Reasonable pot odds (26% equity needed)\n3. Opponent has shown some preflop aggression but not excessive\n4. Stack sizes are healthy\n\nI could consider calling to see a flop, but A5o out of position is difficult to play postflop. Folding seems reasonable to preserve my stack for better spots. However, the pot odds are decent and I do have an ace.\n\nWait, let me think about the BB player (Seat 4) still to act behind me. They might call or raise, which changes the dynamic.\n\nActually, looking at the action: Seat 5 folded, Seat 1 folded, Seat 2 raised. So it's just me and the BB left to act. If I call, BB might call or raise.\n\nGiven that I'm in the SB with A5o, out of position against a raiser, and BB still to act, I think folding is the prudent play. I'd rather wait for better spots in position or with stronger hands.\n\nBut let me check if there's any history with this opponent's raises...

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have 6h Td on the Button (BTN)\n- My stack: 172 chips (86 BB)\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2) raised to 6 (3x BB)\n- Amount to call: 6\n- Pot is currently 9 (1 SB + 2 BB + 6 raise)\n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button, which is excellent position. However, my hand is very weak - T6 offsuit is a bottom-tier hand.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:** From the recall, Kimi-K2 has raised preflop to 6 chips in both previous hands where they raised (hands 2 and 7). This suggests a consistent 3x BB opening size. I don't have showdown information about what hands they showed down with.\n\n**My History:** I've folded 6 out of 7 hands, winning only 1 hand. My stack is 172 chips, which is below average but not critical.\n\n**Pot Odds:** To call 6 into a pot of 15 (9 current + 6 if I call), I'm getting 2.5:1 pot odds. However, there are still players behind me who could act: MiniMax-M2 (SB) and GPT-OSS-120B (BB). They could call or raise.\n\n**Hand Strength:** T6o is a terrible hand. It has poor high-card value, no connectivity, and is offsuit. Even with position, this hand plays poorly postflop. It's only good for bluff catching or hitting two pair+.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** With 86 BB, I have plenty of chips. No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands.\n\n**Alternatives:** I could consider 3-betting as a bluff given my position, but T6o is too weak even for that. Folding is clearly correct.\n\nThe button position is tempting, but the hand is just too weak to play, especially facing a raise. Even if I call, I'll be out of position against the raiser postflop unless everyone folds, which is unlikely given the blinds still to act.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. Wait for a better spot.",

In tournament poker, especially from UTG, I should be playing tight.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB): Has mostly folded preflop (7/10 times), raised once, checked once, bet once postflop. Seems fairly tight.\n- MiniMax-M2 (next to act after me): Has mostly folded preflop (8/10 times), called once, and was involved in one hand postflop. Very tight.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (SB): Has called twice preflop, folded 3 times, and been aggressive postflop in hands they play.\n\nMy stack is 172 chips (86 BB), which is healthy but not huge. The blinds are 1/2, so I have plenty of room to be patient.\n\nFrom UTG with J8s, the standard play is to fold. While it's suited and can make flushes, it's not a strong enough hand to open from early position. The J8 gap is also problematic - it's a \"gap connector\" but the gap is large (5 cards between J and 8).\n\nIf I raise, I'll be out of position against the entire table, which is difficult with a marginal hand. If I call, I'll invite others to call behind me, creating a multiway pot with a weak hand.\n\nGiven my tournament position (86 BB) and the need to preserve chips, folding is the correct play. I should wait for better spots, especially since I'm UTG and have 5 players left to act behind me (including the blinds).\n\nThe pot odds are 3:2 (2 to call into 3 pot), but implied odds are poor because I'll be out of position and the hand doesn't have great postflop playability.\n\nLet me check if there's any history of opponents being particularly loose or aggressive that might change this decision. Looking at the opponent actions, they seem fairly tight overall. Only one raise preflop from Kimi-K2 Thinking in 10 actions, and most players are folding frequently.\n\nThus, I should fold.",

However, I have position (button) and only need to call 1 chip to see the flop, with a pot of 3 chips already (my SB 1 + BB 2). That's 3:1 pot odds for a 1 chip call.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 (in the BB) has folded most hands preflop (hands 6-10), but in hand #11 they raised preflop to 4 chips and then called a re-raise. So they're not always passive - they can raise with decent hands.\n\nMy stack is 169 chips (84.5 BB), which is healthy. The BB has 216 chips. I have position advantage being on the button.\n\nWith Q3 suited, the main value is in flush potential. Q-high isn't strong, and 3 is a weak kicker. However, calling just 1 chip with 3:1 pot odds from the button makes this a reasonable speculative call. I can see a flop cheaply and potentially hit a flush draw or two pair.\n\nI should consider raising, but Q3s is too weak to raise for value, and I don't want to bloat the pot with a weak hand. Folding seems too tight given the great pot odds and position.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack (84.5 BB), so I can afford to take some small risks. Preserving chips is important, but passing up +EV spots is also costly.\n\nDecision: Call the 1 chip. This gives me position with a speculative hand at good odds. If I miss the flop completely, I can easily fold to any aggression. If I hit a flush draw or something decent, I can continue.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Calling with Q3s on button getting 3:1 pot odds.

This gives me good control over the hand.\n\n**Potential Strategies:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card and see the turn. With a backdoor flush draw and position, this might be best.\n2. **Raise**: Semi-bluff to try to take the pot down now. But with only queen-high and weak draws, this is risky.\n3. **Fold**: Not an option since checking is free.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 84 BB, a healthy stack\n- No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands\n- Position allows me to play cautiously\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check. Reasons:\n- Free card with backdoor draws\n- Position advantage lets me see what opponent does on turn\n- Very weak made hand - not worth investing chips\n- If opponent bets on turn, I can easily fold\n- If turn improves my draw, I can consider continuing\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Checking with queen-high and backdoor flush draw.

The board is Ah 9d 5s 8c. I have:\n- No pair\n- Backdoor flush draw (need heart on river)\n- Backdoor straight draw (need 7 or 4 to make 5-8 straight, but with Q3 that's unlikely)\n- Essentially queen high\n\nThe pot is tiny (4 chips).

The pot is tiny, so there's little to gain. However, I'm in position and could potentially bluff if I think opponent is weak.\n\nGiven opponent checked flop and turn so far, they likely have a weak hand too. But with an Ace on board, they could have any Ace, which beats me. Or they could have a pair like 9, 8, or 5.\n\nThe prudent play is to check and see a free river.

The board has Ah, Jh, 9d, 8c, 5s. My best hand is Queen-high. The Jh on the river doesn't help me. I have a busted flush draw (hearts didn't come). This is a very weak hand.\n\n**Opponent Analysis (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the search results, I can see MiniMax-M2:\n- Hand #11: Had pocket 9s, raised preflop, called a 3-bet, checked through flop and turn, then bet 8 on river on a scary board (As Ac Tc Ts 5c) and got a fold\n- Hand #4: Called a flop bet with Jd Kh on 9h 5d 3c board, then bet turn when checked to\n- Hand #9: Folded preflop\n- Generally seems to play somewhat cautiously but capable of value betting\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- The pot is only 4 chips (tiny)\n- I have position (act first on river)\n- Both of us have checked through flop and turn\n- The river Jack is a medium card that could complete some draws\n\n**Possible Opponent Hands:**\n- Could have weak Ace, middle pair, or missed draw\n- Given the checking pattern, likely doesn't have a strong hand\n- Might have a Jack or weak pair\n\n**Decision Options:**\n1. **Check**: Give up with Queen-high, pot goes to showdown\n2. **Bet/Bluff**: Try to steal the tiny pot with a bluff\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Pot is only 4 chips - not worth risking much\n- My hand is very weak (Queen-high)\n- Opponent might call with any pair or Ace-high\n- Bluff success probability is low given my weak hand and board texture\n- Tournament implications: I have 84 BB, so preserving chips is more important than trying to steal 2 BB\n\n**Optimal Decision:** Check and give up. The pot is too small to risk a bluff, and my hand has zero showdown value. If opponent has anything at all (even Ace-high), they'll call.

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this situation. I'm on the button with 7c 9d, which is a weak offsuit hand. My stack is 168 chips (84 BB). The blinds are 1/2. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 1, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted BB 2. Seats 1 and 2 folded. It's my action with 2 chips to call.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised preflop once in hand #11 to 4 chips (2x raise)\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has raised preflop once in hand #10 to 8 chips (4x raise)\n\nMy own hand history shows I've been playing quite tight, folding most hands. I have 1 win out of 12 hands (8.3% win rate).\n\nConsidering my position on the button, this is a favorable spot to play more hands. However, 7-9 offsuit is a very weak hand. The key factors:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: 7-9o is weak, not suited, not connected well. It plays poorly postflop.\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is great - I get to act last postflop.\n3. **Stack size**: 84 BB is healthy, but I'm the shortest stack at the table.\n4. **Opponents**: SB and BB are yet to act. They could have strong hands or could check.\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 to win 5 (3 pot + my 2 call), so I'm getting 2.5:1 odds.\n\nHowever, 7-9o is a hand that needs implied odds to be profitable - I need to hit a strong hand (two pair, trips, straight) to win a big pot. With only the blinds left to act, there's a chance they might check if I limp, but they could also raise.\n\nGiven that I'm the shortest stack and have been playing tight, I could consider a small raise to steal the blinds. But 7-9o is not a good hand to raise with from any position, even the button. The risk is that one of the blinds has a decent hand and calls or re-raises.\n\nBetter to either fold or call. Calling (limping) could be okay if I think the blinds will often check. But if they raise, I'll have to fold and lose 2 chips.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: Seat 4 has 219 chips, Seat 5 has 226 chips. I have 168 chips. I'm the short stack. In tournament poker, preserving chips is important.\n\nGiven the weakness of my hand and my short stack status, folding seems prudent. 7-9o is just too weak to play from any position, even the button. The 2 chips I save could be more valuable later with a better hand.\n\nI'll fold.",

My stack is 168 chips (84 BB), which is decent but not huge.\n\nFrom the opponent analysis:\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has raised preflop twice (both to 4 chips, 2x the BB)\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has raised preflop once (to 8 chips, 4x the BB)\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) is in the BB and has shown some aggression (raised to 8 with 24o in hand 6)\n\nAs UTG with J8o, this is a clear fold. Reasons:\n1. J8o is a weak hand, especially from UTG position\n2. I have 3 players behind me who can act (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, and Kimi-K2 Thinking)\n3. Both MiniMax-M2 and GPT-OSS-120B have shown they will raise preflop\n4. Even if I call the 2 chips, I'll be out of position postflop against potentially multiple opponents\n5. The hand doesn't have good implied odds - it's not suited, not connected well\n6. Tournament strategy: preserve stack and wait for better spots\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a stronger hand in better position.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- My hand: Tc Qc (Ten of clubs, Queen of clubs)\n- Board: 9c Jh Ad (9 clubs, Jack hearts, Ace diamonds)\n- Position: BB, facing opponent in SB who raised preflop to 6 and then checked on flop\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- My stack: 162 chips (81 BB)\n- Opponent stack: 192 chips\n\n**Hand strength:**\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (need a King for a straight: Qc-Tc-9c-Jh-Ad, K would give me Q-K-T-J-9 straight)\n- Backdoor flush draw (two clubs, board has one club)\n- Very weak made hand - Queen high with one overcard to board (Queen vs Jack and 9)\n- Ace on board is a concern - opponent could have Ace-x\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the data, opponent (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) has raised preflop 3 times out of 15 hands (hands 2, 7, 8). They've folded a lot recently (hands 9-15 all folds preflop). This suggests they might be tightening up or had weak cards. Their preflop raise to 6 (3x BB) is standard.\n\n**Flop analysis:**\nBoard is 9c Jh Ad - this is a relatively dry board except for the Ace. The flop likely missed many hands. Opponent checked after raising preflop, which could mean:\n1. They have a weak Ace (A-x with weak kicker)\n2. They missed completely (like KQ, Q10, etc.)\n3. They're slow-playing a strong hand (AA, AJ, A9, sets) - less likely since they'd probably bet for value\n\n**My options:**\n1. **Check**: Take free card, see turn. With my draws, this is reasonable.\n2. **Raise**: Semi-bluff with draws. Could represent an Ace or strong hand.\n\n**Stack considerations:** I have 81 BB, opponent has 96 BB. I'm not short-stacked.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 12 chips. If I bet, I'd need fold equity or good implied odds for draws.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven that opponent checked after raising preflop, they likely don't have a strong Ace or set. They might have missed or have a weak Ace. I have decent draws: gutshot straight (4 outs) + backdoor flush (roughly 1.5 outs) + maybe Queen outs if they have weak Ace (3 outs). That's about 8.5 outs total, ~18% equity.\n\nA semi-bluff bet could win the pot now if they fold weak hands. If they call, I still have decent equity. Minimum raise is to 4 chips (bet 2 chips), but I should bet more for fold equity.\n\nI think a moderate bet of 6-8 chips (half pot) is good. Let me bet 8 chips (raise to 8 total, betting 6 into 12 pot). This gives me good fold equity while not overcommitting.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 8,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Semi-bluff with gutshot straight draw and backdoor flush draw.

Amount to call: 13 chips, pot is 21 + 13 = 34 chips? Actually pot calculation: SB 1 + BB 2 + raise 4 + 3-bet 14 + my SB 1 already posted = 22?

Even against a wide 3-bet range like top 15% of hands, 78o has only about 30% equity. But we're out of position, which reduces our playability significantly.\n\nTournament considerations: We have 86.5 BB, which is healthy. No need to gamble with marginal hands out of position.\n\nThe fact that we're in SB means we'll have to act first on every street, making this hand even harder to play.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot.

However, I'm on the button, which is the best position, and both players who have acted are already folded. The only players left are the small blind (MiniMax-M2) and big blind (GPT-OSS-120B).\n\nLooking at the recall data:\n- MiniMax-M2 has raised preflop 3 times (hands 11, 13, 14) - seems to be somewhat aggressive\n- GPT-OSS-120B has also raised preflop 3 times (hands 10, 15, 17) - also aggressive\n- My own history shows I've folded a lot (14 folds out of 17 hands, win rate 11.8%)\n\nThe pot is 3 chips (SB 1 + BB 2). I need to call 2 chips to see the flop. My stack is 173 chips (86.5 BB).\n\nWith 9-5 offsuit, this is a trash hand. However, being on the button against just the blinds, sometimes players might try to steal with weak hands. But 9-5o is really bad - no connectedness, no suitedness, low cards.\n\nThe blinds are 1/2, so calling 2 chips is 1 BB. Pot odds: I need to call 2 to win 3, so I need ~40% equity. I definitely don't have 40% equity against random hands.\n\nIf I raise, minimum raise is to 4 total (2 more). But raising with this hand is too ambitious.\n\nGiven my position, I could consider a steal attempt, but:\n1. Both blinds have shown aggression\n2. My hand is terrible\n3. I have a healthy stack (86.5 BB)\n4. Better to wait for a better spot\n\nI should fold. No reason to play this hand. Even if I call and see a flop, I'll often miss completely or have a weak pair that's hard to play.\n\nTournament considerations: Preserve stack, wait for better opportunities. My win rate is low (11.8%), so I need to be selective.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

With such a weak hand and aggressive players behind me, calling or raising would be a mistake. Even if I call the 2 chips, there's a high probability that someone behind me will raise, forcing me to fold and lose my chips.\n\nMy stack is 173 chips (86.5 BB), which is healthy but not huge. I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots.\n\nFrom my hand history, I've been folding a lot (15 folds out of 18 hands), but that's appropriate given my cards and position. I won one hand recently with Tc Qc from BB, which was a decent hand.\n\nThe pot is only 3 chips, so not worth risking chips with 74o from UTG.\n\nDecision: Fold.

Looking at their history:\n- They've raised preflop 3 times (hands 11, 13, 14) - seems somewhat aggressive\n- They've called preflop 3 times (hands 4, 11, 18)\n- They showed down Jc Tc in hand 12\n\n**My hand analysis**: Ah 4c is not a strong hand. Ace-rag offsuit. However, I'm on the button with position, which is valuable. Against a single BB who will likely defend wide, I have some playability.\n\n**Position advantage**: Being on the BTN means I get to act last postflop, which is a huge advantage.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 2 into a pot of 6 (after my SB). That's 3:1 pot odds, which is excellent. Even with a weak hand, these odds justify calling.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: I have a decent stack (43 BB), not desperate. But I also want to accumulate chips. Folding would be too tight given the excellent pot odds and position.\n\n**Possible actions**:\n1. **Fold**: Too tight given pot odds and position\n2. **Call (2)**: Good option - see a flop cheaply with position\n3. **Raise**: Could be good to take initiative, but with A4o, raising might commit us to a pot with a weak hand\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression (3 raises in recent hands), they might be willing to defend their BB with a wide range. Calling seems best - see a flop cheaply, then use position to make decisions.\n\nIf I hit an Ace or a good draw, I can continue. If not, I can fold cheaply.\n\n**Decision**: Call."

That shows he's capable of donk betting on flop after checking preflop. He seems somewhat aggressive but has folded many hands preflop recently.\n\n**My hand history:**\nI've been folding a lot (17 folds out of 21 hands), winning only 3 hands. My stack is 171 chips (down from starting 200). Need to accumulate chips.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Top pair weak kicker. Vulnerable to better Aces (AK, AQ, AJ, AT) or two pair (K9, A9). Also vulnerable to draws (flush draw with clubs, straight draws).\n2. **Position:** I have position advantage - can see opponent's action first on turn/river.\n3. **Pot size:** Small pot (8 chips). Could try to build it with my top pair.\n4. **Stack sizes:** I have 171 chips, opponent has 221. Not huge difference.\n5. **Tournament:** Need to accumulate chips but also preserve stack.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check:** Control pot size, see turn card. But gives free card to draws.\n- **Bet/raise:** Build pot with top pair, charge draws, get value from worse hands.\n\nGiven I have top pair and position, I should bet for value and protection. The board is somewhat wet (flush draw possible with clubs, straight draws possible). A small bet (like 4-6 chips) seems reasonable. This builds the pot with my decent hand while not committing too much with weak kicker.\n\nI'll bet 5 chips (total 5 into 8 pot). That's a reasonable sizing.",

This is a decent position but the hand is weak - 6-8 offsuit. \n\n**Stack**: 179 chips (44.8 BB) - healthy stack.\n\n**Opponents**: \n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB) has 219 chips. From the data, he has been folding most hands preflop (7 out of 10 actions are folds). He called once from SB when facing a min-raise, then bet on flop. He checked once from BB when facing no action. Seems tight.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, BB) has 212 chips. Has folded 6 out of 10 times preflop, raised once (hand 19), checked once from BB. Also seems fairly tight.\n\n**My history**: I've won 4 out of 22 hands (18% win rate). Recently won hand 22 with A4o from SB by calling and betting flop with top pair.\n\n**Current situation**: I'm on BTN facing only blinds. 6-8o is a weak hand but in position against likely tight players. The pot is 6 chips, I need to call 4 chips (2.2% of my stack).\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 6-8o is weak but can make straights and occasionally two pair. Not a premium hand by any means.\n2. **Position**: Being on BTN is huge advantage - I act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Both seem tight, likely to fold to aggression unless they have strong hands.\n4. **Pot odds**: 4 to call into 10 pot (if I call) = 2.5:1 odds. Need ~28% equity to call. 6-8o vs random hands has ~35% equity, but vs tight ranges probably less.\n5. **Tournament**: I have healthy stack, can afford to see a cheap flop.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold. 6-8o is too weak even on BTN against blinds. While position is good, the hand has very little potential to improve and will be dominated often. Better to wait for better spots. The tight opponents might defend their blinds with stronger ranges than random.\n\nHowever, let me consider if I should raise as a steal attempt. Minimum raise to 8 chips (4 more). If both fold, I win 6 chips. If called, I'm out of position with a weak hand. Given opponent tightness, a raise might work, but 6-8o is a poor hand to continue with if called. I'd rather raise with better hands.\n\nFold is correct."

This is a decent position but the hand is weak - 6-8 offsuit. \n\n**Stack**: 179 chips (44.8 BB) - healthy stack.\n\n**Opponents**: \n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, SB) has 219 chips. From the data, he has been folding most hands preflop (7 out of 10 actions are folds). He called once from SB when facing a min-raise, then bet on flop. He checked once from BB when facing no action. Seems tight.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, BB) has 212 chips. Has folded 6 out of 10 times preflop, raised once (hand 19), checked once from BB. Also seems fairly tight.\n\n**My history**: I've won 4 out of 22 hands (18% win rate). Recently won hand 22 with A4o from SB by calling and betting flop with top pair.\n\n**Current situation**: I'm on BTN facing only blinds. 6-8o is a weak hand but in position against likely tight players. The pot is 6 chips, I need to call 4 chips (2.2% of my stack).\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 6-8o is weak but can make straights and occasionally two pair. Not a premium hand by any means.\n2. **Position**: Being on BTN is huge advantage - I act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Both seem tight, likely to fold to aggression unless they have strong hands.\n4. **Pot odds**: 4 to call into 10 pot (if I call) = 2.5:1 odds. Need ~28% equity to call. 6-8o vs random hands has ~35% equity, but vs tight ranges probably less.\n5. **Tournament**: I have healthy stack, can afford to see a cheap flop.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold. 6-8o is too weak even on BTN against blinds. While position is good, the hand has very little potential to improve and will be dominated often. Better to wait for better spots. The tight opponents might defend their blinds with stronger ranges than random.\n\nHowever, let me consider if I should raise as a steal attempt. Minimum raise to 8 chips (4 more). If both fold, I win 6 chips. If called, I'm out of position with a weak hand. Given opponent tightness, a raise might work, but 6-8o is a poor hand to continue with if called. I'd rather raise with better hands.\n\nFold is correct.",

My stack is 179 chips (44.8 BB).\n\nFrom the opponent action recall, Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has raised preflop 4 times in previous hands, always to 6 chips (1.5x BB). This time they raised to 12 (3x BB), which is a larger sizing than their previous raises. This could indicate a stronger hand.\n\nMy hand (K4o) is weak, especially facing a raise. King-four offsuit is a marginal hand that should typically be folded from the cutoff, especially facing a raise from early position. I have position on the raiser (they're in seat 2, I'm in seat 3), but that's not enough to justify playing such a weak hand.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 12 to win 18 (2+4+12). That's 12 to win 18, or 1:1.5 pot odds. I need about 40% equity to call. K4o likely has less than 40% equity against a raising range, especially given the opponent's adjusted sizing.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 44.8 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to gamble with marginal hands. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nThere are still players to act behind me (Seat 4 MiniMax-M2 and Seat 5 GPT-OSS-120B), which adds additional risk of being squeezed.\n\nGiven all this, the correct play is to fold.",

Reasons:\n1. The hand is very weak - suited connectors need to be played in position or with deep stacks, and 6-7 offsuit is particularly weak.\n2. Early position means I have 4 players left to act behind me who could raise.\n3. My stack is 44.8 BB, which is decent but not worth risking with this hand.\n4. Tournament considerations: Preserving my stack is important, and playing weak hands from early position is a good way to lose chips.\n5. The blinds are small relative to my stack, so I can wait for better spots.\n\nEven if I were on the button or in late position, this hand might be marginal, but from UTG it's an easy fold. Let me check my own hand history to see if I've been playing too tight or loose."

My stack is 179 chips (44.8 BB), which is healthy but not massive.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has been folding a lot recently (5 straight folds preflop)\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) raised in hand #24 and was involved in a big pot\n- MiniMax-M2 seems to play fairly tight based on the hands I saw\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has shown some aggression with raises (hand #24 raised to 30 preflop)\n\nFrom UTG with 6s7d, this is a clear fold. Reasons:\n1. The hand is very weak - suited connectors need to be played in position or with deep stacks, and 6-7 offsuit is particularly weak.\n2. Early position means I have 4 players left to act behind me who could raise.\n3. My stack is 44.8 BB, which is decent but not worth risking with this hand.\n4. Tournament considerations: Preserving my stack is important, and playing weak hands from early position is a good way to lose chips.\n5. The blinds are small relative to my stack, so I can wait for better spots.\n\nEven if I were on the button or in late position, this hand might be marginal, but from UTG it's an easy fold. Let me check my own hand history to see if I've been playing too tight or loose.",

I need to call 8 chips to continue.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A6s is a decent hand in the BB to defend with. It's suited, has an Ace, and can make strong flush draws. However, it's dominated by better Ax hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position (BB vs UTG). This is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the opponent data for Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking):\n   - They've been folding a lot (14/20 actions are folds)\n   - They raised once preflop (hand #17: raised to 14)\n   - They called once preflop (hand #19: called 4 from BB)\n   - They've shown down with JQo (hand #19) and 86o (hand #9)\n   \n   This suggests they might be somewhat tight but not extremely so. Their raise from UTG indicates a decent hand, but not necessarily premium given they've shown down mediocre hands before.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18, I need to call 8. That's 2.25:1 pot odds (31% equity needed). A6s vs a typical UTG raising range (maybe 15-20% of hands) has about 35-40% equity. So pot odds alone justify a call.\n\n5. **Stack sizes**: We both have 175 chips (43.8 BB). This is a deep stack situation, which favors speculative hands like suited Aces.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: We're early in the tournament with deep stacks. Taking a small risk with good odds is acceptable.\n\n7. **Alternatives**: I could raise, but being out of position with a marginal hand against an UTG raiser is risky. A6s doesn't play well as a 3-bet bluff OOP.\n\nGiven the pot odds, my hand being suited with an Ace, and the opponent's tendency to show down with mediocre hands, I think calling is correct. Folding would be too tight given the price.\n\nI should call and see a flop. If I hit an Ace or flush draw, I can continue. If I miss completely, I can check-fold."

I need to call 8 chips to continue.\n\nLet's analyze:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A6s is a decent hand in the BB to defend with. It's suited, has an Ace, and can make strong flush draws. However, it's dominated by better Ax hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm out of position (BB vs UTG). This is a disadvantage.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the opponent data for Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking):\n   - They've been folding a lot (14/20 actions are folds)\n   - They raised once preflop (hand #17: raised to 14)\n   - They called once preflop (hand #19: called 4 from BB)\n   - They've shown down with JQo (hand #19) and 86o (hand #9)\n   \n   This suggests they might be somewhat tight but not extremely so. Their raise from UTG indicates a decent hand, but not necessarily premium given they've shown down mediocre hands before.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18, I need to call 8. That's 2.25:1 pot odds (31% equity needed). A6s vs a typical UTG raising range (maybe 15-20% of hands) has about 35-40% equity. So pot odds alone justify a call.\n\n5. **Stack sizes**: We both have 175 chips (43.8 BB). This is a deep stack situation, which favors speculative hands like suited Aces.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: We're early in the tournament with deep stacks. Taking a small risk with good odds is acceptable.\n\n7. **Alternatives**: I could raise, but being out of position with a marginal hand against an UTG raiser is risky. A6s doesn't play well as a 3-bet bluff OOP.\n\nGiven the pot odds, my hand being suited with an Ace, and the opponent's tendency to show down with mediocre hands, I think calling is correct. Folding would be too tight given the price.\n\nI should call and see a flop. If I hit an Ace or flush draw, I can continue. If I miss completely, I can check-fold.",

Opponent has same stack. \n\nThe pot odds: 18:8 = 2.25:1, requiring ~31% equity. A6s vs a reasonable UTG range (say 15%: 77+, A9s+, KTs+, QTs+, AJo+, KQo) has about 35% equity. So mathematically a call is justified.\n\nPosition is bad (OOP), but with suited Ace and good pot odds, calling seems reasonable. Raising is an option but risky OOP with a marginal hand.\n\nGiven opponent's history: they've shown down mediocre hands (JQo, 86o) and folded a lot. Their UTG raise might not be super strong. They raised to 12 (3x) which is standard.\n\nI think calling is the best play. Let me structure the JSON response.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My hand: As 6s (ace-six suited)\n- Board: 9c 7d 3h (rainbow, no flush draws)\n- My stack: 167 chips (41.8 BB)\n- Pot: 26 chips\n- Opponent: Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) with 175 chips\n- Position: I'm in BB, opponent is UTG (Seat 1)\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Preflop: Opponent raised to 12 (3x BB), I called 8 more from BB\n- Now on flop: No bet to call (amount to call is 0), I can check or raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My hand: Ace-high with backdoor flush draw (spades, but board has no spades yet)\n- Board: 9c 7d 3h - dry board, no obvious draws except maybe straight draws (8-T, 5-8)\n- I have overcard (Ace) and backdoor flush/straight possibilities\n- Opponent's range: UTG raise suggests stronger hands: pairs 77+, broadways, suited connectors\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall, Kimi-K2 Thinking has been folding a lot recently (last 5 hands folded preflop). Only played one hand to showdown (hand 19) where they checked all streets. This suggests they might be playing tight/passive. However, they did raise preflop this hand from UTG, which indicates some strength.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n1. **Pot Control**: With Ace-high on a dry board, I'm likely behind most of UTG's raising range (pairs 99+, overpairs, maybe AJ+).\n2. **Initiative**: Opponent has preflop initiative, but checked to me on flop? Wait, actually the action says \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning it's my turn to act first on flop? Let me check: Seat 1 raised preflop, I called. On flop, I'm first to act (since I'm BB and called, opponent is UTG who raised). So I act first.\n3. **Stack Sizes**: I have 167 chips, opponent has 175. Pot is 26. Reasonable stack-to-pot ratio.\n4. **Tournament**: Need to preserve chips but also accumulate.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Check**: Allows opponent to take control, but keeps pot small with marginal hand. Good for pot control.\n- **Raise**: Semi-bluff with Ace-high. Could represent a pair or draw. But board is dry, so less credible.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven the dry board and my weak hand (ace-high with backdoor draws), checking seems best. I want to see what opponent does. If they bet, I can evaluate pot odds. If they check behind, I get a free turn card.\n\nMy backdoor flush draw needs two more spades, and backdoor straight draws are minimal (5-8 for a straight, but I have A6). Not much equity.\n\nI'll check and see opponent's action. If they bet small, I might call with implied odds for backdoor draws. If they bet big, I can fold.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Ace-high on dry board with backdoor draws.

My stack is 165 chips (41.2 BB), which is healthy but not huge.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been folding frequently preflop (folded hands 24, 25, 26). In hand 23, they called 2 from BB and then played aggressively postflop. In hand 22, they checked from BB when facing no raise.\n\nMy hand is T7 suited (diamonds). This is a weak hand, but I'm on the button with position. The BB has shown some willingness to defend their blind, but has folded the last 3 hands preflop.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 2 to win a pot of 6 (my 2 SB + BB 4). That's 3:1 pot odds, which is excellent. Even with a weak hand, I'm getting good immediate odds.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 41 BB, which is a decent stack. Folding costs nothing but gives up a potential steal opportunity. Calling keeps the pot small and lets me see a flop with position.\n\nRaising could be considered as a steal attempt, but T7s is not a great raising hand even on the button. The BB has been folding recently, so a raise might take it down preflop. Minimum raise to 8 would be putting in 6 more (total 8).\n\nHowever, my hand is weak and if called, I'll be out of position postflop (actually no, I'll have position since I'm button). But still, T7s plays poorly even in position.\n\nGiven the excellent pot odds (3:1) and position, I think calling is reasonable. Folding is too tight given the odds. Raising seems ambitious with such a weak hand.\n\nLet me check: I've already invested 2 as SB. Calling 2 more means total 4 to see flop with 6 in pot. That's good odds.\n\nI'll call and see a flop with position.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand:** 7d Ts\n**Position:** BTN (button)\n**Stack:** 163 chips (40.8 BB)\n**Board:** 9h As Qs\n**Pot:** 8 chips\n**Amount to call:** 0 (we can check)\n**Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 in BB (Seat 4) with 239 chips\n\nMy hand is 7d Ts - not a great hand. On the flop of 9h As Qs, I have:\n- No pair\n- Backdoor straight draw (need J and 8 for a straight)\n- Backdoor flush draw (two spades, need runner-runner spades)\n- Very weak overall\n\nFrom opponent data, MiniMax-M2 has been fairly active but also folding preflop recently (folds in hands 24, 25, 26). They've shown some aggression post-flop (betting on flop and river in hand 23).\n\nThe pot is only 8 chips. I'm in position (button) which is good, but my hand has very little equity. I have 40.8 BB stack, which is healthy but not huge.\n\nGiven the board (A high with Q and 9), my opponent could have many better hands. Even if they have nothing, they might bluff at this dry board. My hand has almost no showdown value and minimal drawing potential.\n\nHowever, since the amount to call is 0 (I can check), and I'm in position, I might consider checking to see a free turn card. But realistically, what can improve my hand? Runner-runner straight or flush, which is about 4% equity.\n\nBetter to check and likely fold to any bet. Or I could consider a small bluff since I'm in position, but with such a weak hand and dry board, it's risky.\n\nActually, let me think: the board is As Qs 9h. This is a somewhat dry board. My opponent checked preflop from BB, so their range is wide. They might check again on flop. If I bet small, I could potentially take it down now. But if they call or raise, I'm in trouble.\n\nGiven tournament considerations and stack preservation, checking seems best. I have position, so I can see what they do on turn. If they check, I get a free card. If they bet, I can easily fold.\n\nLet me check.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand:** 7d Ts (7 of diamonds, Ten of spades)\n**Board:** 9h As Qs\n**Position:** BTN (Button)\n**Stack:** 163 chips (40.8 BB)\n**Opponent:** MiniMax-M2 in BB with 235 chips\n**Pot:** 12 chips\n**Bet to call:** 4 chips (minimum raise to 8)\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nMy hand is 7d Ts - not a great hand. On this flop of 9h As Qs:\n- No pair\n- Backdoor straight draw (J-8 needed, but I have 7-10, so need J-8 or 8-J)\n- Backdoor flush draw with Ts (spade)\n- Essentially, I have nothing but some very weak draws\n\n**Opponent Analysis from recall:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's actions:\n- They tend to bet on the flop when they check preflop as BB (hands 18 and 23)\n- In hand 18: they bet 3 into a pot of ~6 after checking preflop\n- In hand 23: they bet 6 into a pot of ~12 after calling preflop\n- They seem to continuation bet when checked to on flop\n- They have been folding a lot preflop recently (hands 19-26 mostly folds)\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nPot is 12 chips, bet is 4 chips. I need to call 4 to win 16 (12+4). That's 4:16 or 1:4, meaning I need 20% equity to call.\n\n**Equity Estimate:**\nAgainst a reasonable range for BB who checked preflop and bets small on flop:\n- Could have any Ax, Qx, 9x, flush draws, straight draws\n- My hand has maybe 15-20% equity at best against that range\n- The backdoor draws are very weak\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 163 chips (40.8 BB) - decent stack\n- Opponent has 235 chips\n- Folding loses nothing but the 2 chips I already put in preflop\n\n**Position:**\nI'm on the button, which is good, but I checked the flop, showing weakness.\n\n**Decision:**\nThe small bet of 4 into 12 (1/3 pot) is a standard continuation bet. My hand has very little equity, and even if I hit one of my weak draws on the turn, I'll face more bets. The pot odds are borderline (need 20% equity, have maybe 15-20%). Given my weak hand and the fact that I'm drawing to very weak outs, folding is correct.\n\nBetter to preserve my stack for better spots.",

          "content": "Now I have a good picture. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 9h 7c - a mediocre offsuit hand\n- Position: BTN (button) - excellent position\n- Stack: 163 chips (40.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (3x BB)\n- Pot: 18 chips (blinds 2+4 + raise 12)\n- Amount to call: 12 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Kimi-K2):**\n- Has shown aggressive preflop raising tendencies (5 raises in 27 hands)\n- Typically raises to 6 (1.5x) but raised to 12 in hand #24 (current hand #28)\n- In hand #24, raised to 12, then called a 3bet to 18, then bet flop aggressively\n- Has folded many hands preflop when not raising\n- No showdown history found, so we don't know his actual hand strength\n\n**My History:**\n- I've folded a lot (22 folds in 27 hands)\n- Win rate: 14.8% (4 wins)\n- Recently folded 9-5o from BTN in hand #18\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 9-7o is weak, but has some potential for straights and pairs\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is huge advantage - we act last postflop\n3. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 12 to win 30 (18 pot + 12 opponent bet). That's 2.5:1 odds (29% equity needed)\n4. **Implied Odds**: Good position gives us implied odds if we hit\n5. **Stack Sizes**: Opponent has only 89 chips (22.25 BB), so he's short-stacked and might be pushing with wider range\n6. **Tournament**: We're not in danger zone, but should avoid marginal spots\n\n**Ranges:**\n- Opponent's 3x raise from early position (seat 2 is UTG+1?) suggests decent hand\n- With 22 BB stack, he might be pushing with medium pairs, broadways, suited connectors\n- 9-7o has ~30-35% equity against reasonable raising range\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Conservative, preserves stack\n- **Call**: Take position with marginal hand, see flop\n- **Raise**: Not recommended with this hand\n\nGiven the excellent position, decent pot odds (29% equity needed), and opponent's short stack (might be stealing), I think a call is reasonable. However, 9-7o is quite weak and we're out of position relative to the blinds who still act after us (SB and BB). Actually wait - we're on BTN, so SB and BB act after us preflop? No, preflop action goes: UTG (folded), UTG+1 (raised), then us on BTN, then SB, then BB. So we have position on everyone postflop.\n\nThe blinds still to act behind us is a concern - they could squeeze. But with opponent's 3x raise, they might fold.\n\nI think the best play is fold. 9-7o is just too weak even with position. The opponent's raise size (12 vs typical 6) suggests strength. Our equity is marginal at best. Better to wait for better spots.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other factors... The opponent has 89 chips, so if we call and hit, we can potentially win his stack. However, we're risking 12 chips (7.4% of our stack) with a weak hand.\n\nActually, reconsidering: With position and opponent's short stack, calling might be okay if we plan to play fit-or-fold on flop. But we need to consider reverse implied odds - if we hit a pair of 9s or 7s, we could be dominated.\n\nI think fold is correct. Let's look for better spots."

          "reasoning_content": "Now I have a good picture. Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 9h 7c - a mediocre offsuit hand\n- Position: BTN (button) - excellent position\n- Stack: 163 chips (40.8 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent: Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12 (3x BB)\n- Pot: 18 chips (blinds 2+4 + raise 12)\n- Amount to call: 12 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Kimi-K2):**\n- Has shown aggressive preflop raising tendencies (5 raises in 27 hands)\n- Typically raises to 6 (1.5x) but raised to 12 in hand #24 (current hand #28)\n- In hand #24, raised to 12, then called a 3bet to 18, then bet flop aggressively\n- Has folded many hands preflop when not raising\n- No showdown history found, so we don't know his actual hand strength\n\n**My History:**\n- I've folded a lot (22 folds in 27 hands)\n- Win rate: 14.8% (4 wins)\n- Recently folded 9-5o from BTN in hand #18\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 9-7o is weak, but has some potential for straights and pairs\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is huge advantage - we act last postflop\n3. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 12 to win 30 (18 pot + 12 opponent bet). That's 2.5:1 odds (29% equity needed)\n4. **Implied Odds**: Good position gives us implied odds if we hit\n5. **Stack Sizes**: Opponent has only 89 chips (22.25 BB), so he's short-stacked and might be pushing with wider range\n6. **Tournament**: We're not in danger zone, but should avoid marginal spots\n\n**Ranges:**\n- Opponent's 3x raise from early position (seat 2 is UTG+1?) suggests decent hand\n- With 22 BB stack, he might be pushing with medium pairs, broadways, suited connectors\n- 9-7o has ~30-35% equity against reasonable raising range\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Conservative, preserves stack\n- **Call**: Take position with marginal hand, see flop\n- **Raise**: Not recommended with this hand\n\nGiven the excellent position, decent pot odds (29% equity needed), and opponent's short stack (might be stealing), I think a call is reasonable. However, 9-7o is quite weak and we're out of position relative to the blinds who still act after us (SB and BB). Actually wait - we're on BTN, so SB and BB act after us preflop? No, preflop action goes: UTG (folded), UTG+1 (raised), then us on BTN, then SB, then BB. So we have position on everyone postflop.\n\nThe blinds still to act behind us is a concern - they could squeeze. But with opponent's 3x raise, they might fold.\n\nI think the best play is fold. 9-7o is just too weak even with position. The opponent's raise size (12 vs typical 6) suggests strength. Our equity is marginal at best. Better to wait for better spots.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other factors... The opponent has 89 chips, so if we call and hit, we can potentially win his stack. However, we're risking 12 chips (7.4% of our stack) with a weak hand.\n\nActually, reconsidering: With position and opponent's short stack, calling might be okay if we plan to play fit-or-fold on flop. But we need to consider reverse implied odds - if we hit a pair of 9s or 7s, we could be dominated.\n\nI think fold is correct. Let's look for better spots.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to output the JSON response. Let me finalize my decision.\n\nThe situation: I have 9h 7c on the button. Seat 2 raised to 12 (3x BB). I need to decide between fold, call, or raise.\n\nMy analysis: 9-7o is a weak hand. Position is good but hand is too weak. Opponent raised to 12 which is larger than his typical 6, suggesting strength. Pot odds are 12 to win 30, needing 29% equity. 9-7o probably has around 30-35% against a reasonable raising range, but with reverse implied odds if we hit a pair. Also, the blinds still to act behind us could squeeze.\n\nGiven the weak hand and the fact that we're not desperate (40 BB stack), I think fold is best. Wait for better spots.\n\nSo my JSON response should be: {\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9-7o is too weak even with position. Opponent's 3x raise suggests strength, and we have 40 BB stack to wait for better spots. The hand has poor playability and reverse implied odds.\"\n}\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me output that.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze the current hand situation. I'm in UTG position with K9 suited (9s Ks). My stack is 163 chips (40.8 BB). The blinds are 2/4, pot is 6 chips. Seat 2 has already folded. I'm first to act after the blinds.\n\nLooking at my hand: K9 suited is not a strong UTG hand. It's speculative at best. In UTG position, I should generally be tight. From my hand history, I've been folding weak hands in UTG (I folded Th6s in UTG in hand #20, and 6s7d in UTG in hand #25).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: I see from the search that opponents have been raising preflop. Kimi-K2 has raised to 12 chips several times (hands #24, #28). GPT-OSS-120B has raised to 30 chips in hand #24. There are aggressive players at the table.\n\nMy position is bad - I'm UTG, so I have to act first and will face action from 4 players behind me. If I call, I'm likely to face raises from later positions.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6 chips, so I'm getting 1.5:1 odds. But implied odds with K9 suited are not great - it's mainly a drawing hand that needs to hit a flush or straight.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 40.8 BB, which is a decent stack. I should preserve it and look for better spots.\n\nGiven all this analysis:\n1. Hand strength: Weak for UTG (K9s is bottom of UTG opening range)\n2. Position: Terrible (UTG)\n3. Opponent tendencies: Aggressive, likely to raise behind me\n4. Pot odds: Not compelling for a speculative hand\n5. Tournament: Better to preserve stack for stronger spots\n\nThe correct play is to fold. I shouldn't be playing K9s from UTG, especially with aggressive players behind me.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K9s is too weak for UTG opening with aggressive players behind.

The SB (Kimi-K2) has raised to 12 total (8 more for me to call). The pot is 16 chips (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise).\n\nLooking at the opponent data: Kimi-K2 has shown some aggression. In hand 28, they raised preflop and then continued betting on flop, turn. In hand 30, they called a raise preflop and then called bets on flop, turn, checked river. They seem like a reasonable player.\n\nMy stack is 159 chips (39.8 BB), which is healthy. The SB has 181 chips (45.3 BB). The pot odds: I need to call 8 chips to win 24 (16 current pot + 8 if I call). That's 2:1 pot odds, or 33% equity needed.\n\nWith 72o, I have very little equity against a SB raising range. Even against a wide SB stealing range, 72o has maybe 30-35% equity. But I'm out of position (BB vs SB), which makes the hand even worse to play postflop.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a decent stack, no need to take marginal spots. Folding preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\nThe fact that I'm getting 2:1 pot odds is tempting, but with such a terrible hand and being out of position, this is an easy fold. I should only defend with much better hands from BB against a SB raise.\n\nLet me check if there's any pattern of SB raising light that I should exploit. From the data, I see Kimi-K2 raised once preflop (hand 28) and folded twice, called once. Not enough data to say they're raising super light from SB.\n\nGiven all this, folding is correct."

Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has limped in for 4 chips. I need to call 2 more chips to see the flop.\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\n- My stack: 157 chips (39.2 BB) - healthy stack\n- Seat 2: 193 chips\n- Seat 4 (BB): 221 chips\n\n**Position:** I'm in the small blind, which is a terrible position postflop. I'll have to act first on every street after the flop.\n\n**Hand Strength:** Q4o is a very weak hand. It's offsuit, no connectivity, and dominated by many hands. It has reverse implied odds - if I hit a Q, I could be dominated by AQ, KQ, QJ, etc. If I hit a 4, it's a weak pair.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has shown a tendency to limp preflop (called 18 and 8 in previous hands). In hand #30, they limped with K9o and ended up winning with two pair.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression preflop with raises. In hand #29, they raised to 12 preflop.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:** I have a decent stack (39 BB). No need to take unnecessary risks with marginal hands out of position.\n\n**Pot Odds:** I need to call 2 chips to win a pot of 12 chips (if BB checks). That's 6:1 pot odds, which is good mathematically. However, position and hand quality matter more.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Terrible hand (Q4o)\n2. Terrible position (SB)\n3. Likely facing a raise from the BB (MiniMax-M2 has shown aggression)\n4. Even if BB checks, I'll be out of position against a limper\n5. Reverse implied odds with Q4o\n\nThe small investment of 2 chips is tempting, but playing Q4o out of position against at least one opponent is a recipe for losing more chips postflop. The BB could easily raise, forcing me to fold after investing 2 chips.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. I'm not desperate for chips with 39 BB.\n\n**Final Decision:** Fold.",

This is a decent position to play from.\n\n**Stack:** 157 chips (39.2 BB) - healthy stack, not desperate.\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): SB with 219 chips. From the history, they raised once from SB (hand #29) to 12, and otherwise mostly folded or checked. They seem somewhat tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): BB with 278 chips. They've folded a lot preflop recently (7 of last 8 hands). They seem very tight preflop.\n\n**Action:** Both early positions folded, SB posted 2, BB posted 4. Action is on me.\n\n**Hand strength:** KTo offsuit is a marginal hand. It's playable from the button, but not super strong. The T (ten) is a bit weak.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Conservative play given marginal hand\n2. **Call:** See a cheap flop with position\n3. **Raise:** Take initiative with position\n\n**Considerations:**\n- SB has shown some aggression (raised once from SB)\n- BB has been folding a lot\n- I have position advantage postflop\n- Pot is 6 chips, call is 4 chips (2.5% of my stack)\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 39BB, I'm not in push/fold territory. I can afford to play some speculative hands.\n\nGiven that BB has been folding a lot and I have position, I think raising could be good to try to take the pot preflop or get heads-up with position. However, KTo is not a great hand to raise with from the button - it's better to raise with stronger hands.\n\nCalling seems reasonable - it's cheap, I have position, and I can see a flop. If I hit a King or Ten, I can continue. If not, I can fold.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent tendencies: BB has folded to a lot of preflop raises recently. A raise might take it down immediately. But if called, I'm out of position against the SB or BB.\n\nWait, I'm on the button - I have position on both blinds. That's good.\n\nLet me think about sizing: Minimum raise is to 8 (double the BB). That's 4 more chips than calling. If I raise to 8, SB would need to call 6 more (from 2 to 8), BB would need to call 4 more (from 4 to 8).\n\nActually, I think calling is the best play here. KTo is a decent hand to see a flop with position, but not strong enough to raise for value. If I raise and get called, I'm building a bigger pot with a marginal hand.\n\nBetter to call, see a flop, and use my position advantage postflop. If I hit something, I can bet. If not, I can check/fold.\n\nI'll call."

They've folded a lot preflop recently (7 of last 8 hands). They seem very tight preflop.\n\n**Action:** Both early positions folded, SB posted 2, BB posted 4. Action is on me.\n\n**Hand strength:** KTo offsuit is a marginal hand. It's playable from the button, but not super strong. The T (ten) is a bit weak.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Conservative play given marginal hand\n2. **Call:** See a cheap flop with position\n3. **Raise:** Take initiative with position\n\n**Considerations:**\n- SB has shown some aggression (raised once from SB)\n- BB has been folding a lot\n- I have position advantage postflop\n- Pot is 6 chips, call is 4 chips (2.5% of my stack)\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 39BB, I'm not in push/fold territory. I can afford to play some speculative hands.\n\nGiven that BB has been folding a lot and I have position, I think raising could be good to try to take the pot preflop or get heads-up with position. However, KTo is not a great hand to raise with from the button - it's better to raise with stronger hands.\n\nCalling seems reasonable - it's cheap, I have position, and I can see a flop. If I hit a King or Ten, I can continue. If not, I can fold.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent tendencies: BB has folded to a lot of preflop raises recently. A raise might take it down immediately. But if called, I'm out of position against the SB or BB.\n\nWait, I'm on the button - I have position on both blinds. That's good.\n\nLet me think about sizing: Minimum raise is to 8 (double the BB). That's 4 more chips than calling. If I raise to 8, SB would need to call 6 more (from 2 to 8), BB would need to call 4 more (from 4 to 8).\n\nActually, I think calling is the best play here. KTo is a decent hand to see a flop with position, but not strong enough to raise for value. If I raise and get called, I'm building a bigger pot with a marginal hand.\n\nBetter to call, see a flop, and use my position advantage postflop. If I hit something, I can bet. If not, I can check/fold.\n\nI'll call.",

The board is 7c Th Ac, so I have middle pair (Tens) but the Ace on board is higher. Actually wait, I have a Ten, so I have a pair of Tens. The Ace is higher, so I don't have top pair - I have middle pair with King kicker.\n\nThe flop is Ace-high with a Ten. This is a decent flop for my hand - I have second pair with a good kicker. The Ace on board is concerning because it's likely to have hit many of my opponent's raising ranges.\n\nOpponent analysis: GPT-OSS-120B has been fairly tight recently (folded many hands preflop). Looking at the history:\n- Hand 23: Called flop bet, bet turn, folded river\n- Hand 24: Raised preflop to 30, check-raised flop to 60, bet turn\n- Many recent folds preflop\n\nThe opponent checked the flop from the BB after checking preflop. This suggests they likely have a weak hand or are slow-playing something strong.\n\nGiven the board (Ace-high), my middle pair with King kicker is decent but vulnerable. The pot is small (10 chips). I'm in position (BTN) against the BB.\n\nOptions:\n1. **Check**: Take a free card and see the turn. This is safe but gives up potential value if opponent has a weaker hand.\n2. **Bet**: Try to get value from weaker hands (smaller pairs, draws). A small bet could work.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 10 chips. If I bet 4-8 chips, I'm risking a small amount to potentially win the pot now or get value.\n\nGiven my position and the fact that opponent checked, I should probably bet for value with my second pair. Many weaker hands might call (smaller pairs, draws). If I get raised, I can reconsider.\n\nI'll make a small bet for value - maybe 6 chips (60% of pot). This is enough to get value from weaker hands but not too much to risk.\n\nLet me check the minimum raise: 4 chips. So I can bet 4-153 chips.\n\nI'll bet 6 chips (raise_to: 6). This is a reasonable value bet with middle pair in position."

The board is 7c Th Ac, so I have middle pair (Tens) but the Ace on board is higher. Actually wait, I have a Ten, so I have a pair of Tens. The Ace is higher, so I don't have top pair - I have middle pair with King kicker.\n\nThe flop is Ace-high with a Ten. This is a decent flop for my hand - I have second pair with a good kicker. The Ace on board is concerning because it's likely to have hit many of my opponent's raising ranges.\n\nOpponent analysis: GPT-OSS-120B has been fairly tight recently (folded many hands preflop). Looking at the history:\n- Hand 23: Called flop bet, bet turn, folded river\n- Hand 24: Raised preflop to 30, check-raised flop to 60, bet turn\n- Many recent folds preflop\n\nThe opponent checked the flop from the BB after checking preflop. This suggests they likely have a weak hand or are slow-playing something strong.\n\nGiven the board (Ace-high), my middle pair with King kicker is decent but vulnerable. The pot is small (10 chips). I'm in position (BTN) against the BB.\n\nOptions:\n1. **Check**: Take a free card and see the turn. This is safe but gives up potential value if opponent has a weaker hand.\n2. **Bet**: Try to get value from weaker hands (smaller pairs, draws). A small bet could work.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 10 chips. If I bet 4-8 chips, I'm risking a small amount to potentially win the pot now or get value.\n\nGiven my position and the fact that opponent checked, I should probably bet for value with my second pair. Many weaker hands might call (smaller pairs, draws). If I get raised, I can reconsider.\n\nI'll make a small bet for value - maybe 6 chips (60% of pot). This is enough to get value from weaker hands but not too much to risk.\n\nLet me check the minimum raise: 4 chips. So I can bet 4-153 chips.\n\nI'll bet 6 chips (raise_to: 6). This is a reasonable value bet with middle pair in position.",

Their recent folding streak indicates tight play. The fact they checked both preflop and flop suggests they don't have a strong Ace or premium hand.\n\nMy hand: Td Ks, board: 7c Th Ac\nI have middle pair (Tens) with King kicker. The Ace on board is the highest card, so I don't have top pair.\n\nGiven opponent's likely weak range and my position, betting for value makes sense. Many weaker hands (smaller pairs, draws) might call. If I get raised, I can fold since opponent has shown aggression with strong hands in Hand 24.\n\nPot is 10 chips.

The board is 7c Th Ac 4c. This is a decent but vulnerable hand. The Ac on board means I don't have top pair with Ace, which is good for me since my kicker is King. However, the flush draw is now present with two clubs.\n\n2. **Opponent's range**: BB checked preflop, called my flop bet, and now checks turn. They could have:\n   - A weaker Ten (T9, T8, etc.)\n   - A draw (flush draw with clubs, straight draws)\n   - A weak Ace (A7, A4, etc.)\n   - A slow-played strong hand (AT, A7, maybe even 77 for set)\n\n3. **Turn decision**: I have position and initiative. The pot is 22 chips. My options:\n   - **Check**: Take a free card, but gives opponent free river if they're on a draw\n   - **Bet**: Continue aggression, charge draws, get value from weaker Tens\n\n4. **Bet sizing considerations**: \n   - Small bet (6-8 chips): Gets called by draws and weaker hands, builds pot\n   - Medium bet (10-12 chips): More pressure on draws, still gets value\n   - Large bet (14+ chips): Puts serious pressure, may fold out weaker hands\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 147 chips (36.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. Opponent has 272 chips. I should play cautiously but also look for value.\n\n**Decision**: I think I should bet for value. I have top pair with a decent kicker, and many draws are available (flush draw, straight draws). A bet of 10-12 chips seems reasonable - about half pot. This charges draws while still getting value from weaker Tens.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious about the flush draw. If I bet and get raised, I might be in trouble. But given opponent's checking pattern, they're likely weak or drawing.\n\nLet me bet 12 chips (about 55% of pot). This puts pressure on draws while getting value from weaker holdings. If raised, I can re-evaluate based on sizing."

The board is 7c Th Ac 4c. This is a decent but vulnerable hand. The Ac on board means I don't have top pair with Ace, which is good for me since my kicker is King. However, the flush draw is now present with two clubs.\n\n2. **Opponent's range**: BB checked preflop, called my flop bet, and now checks turn. They could have:\n   - A weaker Ten (T9, T8, etc.)\n   - A draw (flush draw with clubs, straight draws)\n   - A weak Ace (A7, A4, etc.)\n   - A slow-played strong hand (AT, A7, maybe even 77 for set)\n\n3. **Turn decision**: I have position and initiative. The pot is 22 chips. My options:\n   - **Check**: Take a free card, but gives opponent free river if they're on a draw\n   - **Bet**: Continue aggression, charge draws, get value from weaker Tens\n\n4. **Bet sizing considerations**: \n   - Small bet (6-8 chips): Gets called by draws and weaker hands, builds pot\n   - Medium bet (10-12 chips): More pressure on draws, still gets value\n   - Large bet (14+ chips): Puts serious pressure, may fold out weaker hands\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 147 chips (36.8 BB), which is a healthy stack. Opponent has 272 chips. I should play cautiously but also look for value.\n\n**Decision**: I think I should bet for value. I have top pair with a decent kicker, and many draws are available (flush draw, straight draws). A bet of 10-12 chips seems reasonable - about half pot. This charges draws while still getting value from weaker Tens.\n\nHowever, I need to be cautious about the flush draw. If I bet and get raised, I might be in trouble. But given opponent's checking pattern, they're likely weak or drawing.\n\nLet me bet 12 chips (about 55% of pot). This puts pressure on draws while getting value from weaker holdings. If raised, I can re-evaluate based on sizing.",

          "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with the proper JSON format. Let me think about the action:\n\nThe situation: Turn, board is 7c Th Ac 4c. I have Td Ks (top pair with King kicker). Opponent checked to me. Pot is 22 chips. Amount to call is 0. Legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nI want to bet for value. That would be a \"raise\" action since I'm betting when checked to. I need to specify \"raise_to\" as the total amount I'm putting in. If I want to bet 12 chips, that means I'm raising to 12 total (since I have 0 in so far). Actually wait - I need to be careful. The minimum raise to is 6. That means I need to put in at least 6 more than whatever the current bet is. Since it's checked to me and amount to call is 0, I think I can bet any amount from 6 to my entire stack.\n\nActually, in poker terminology: when facing a check and I want to bet, I use \"raise\" with \"raise_to\" being the amount I want to put in total. Since there's no bet to call, I'm essentially making a new bet. So if I want to bet 12 chips, I'd set \"raise_to\": 12.\n\nBut let me double-check: The \"minimum raise to: 6\" suggests that if I want to raise, I need to make it at least 6 total. That seems low - maybe it means I need to raise by at least 6 more than the current bet? But current bet is 0... Actually in no-limit, when checked to, you can bet any amount from the minimum bet (usually the big blind) up to your stack. The minimum bet is usually the big blind (4 chips). But it says \"minimum raise to: 6\" which is confusing.\n\nActually, I think \"minimum raise to: 6\" means that if I want to raise (bet), the minimum total amount I can put in is 6 chips. That makes sense: big blind is 4, so minimum bet would be 4, but maybe because previous street had betting, the minimum is 6? Or maybe it's a tournament rule.\n\nAnyway, I want to bet around 12 chips. That's above the minimum of 6. So I'll use \"raise\" with \"raise_to\": 12.\n\nReasoning: I have top pair with King kicker, should bet for value against draws and weaker Tens. Bet of 12 chips (55% pot) charges draws appropriately while building pot.\n\nLet me output JSON.",

UTG is the worst position to play from, especially with a weak hand like K2o.\n\nMy stack is 169 chips (42.2 BB), which is decent but not huge. The blinds are 2/4.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB): Has been folding a lot preflop (7 out of 10 hands), but did raise once to 12 chips in hand #30. They have the smallest stack at 133 chips.\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has raised once preflop (hand #29) and folded most other times.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB): Has been folding a lot (5 out of 10 hands), checked once from SB, and called a bet on flop once.\n\nI'm first to act preflop. With K2o from UTG, this is an easy fold in most situations. The hand has very little potential - it's not suited, not connected, and the King is weak with a 2 kicker. Even if I hit a King, I'll often be dominated by better Kings.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips into a pot of 6 chips (after my call, pot would be 10). That's 2.5:1 odds, but the hand is so weak that these odds don't justify playing.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 42 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to gamble with such a weak hand from early position.\n\nThere are still 4 players to act behind me (SB, BB, and two others who haven't acted yet). Even if I call, I could face raises from later positions.\n\nGiven all this, folding is clearly the best play. I should wait for better spots from better positions.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand:** 5c Jh (off-suit, weak hand)\n**Position:** BB (defending blind)\n**Stack:** 165 chips (41.2 BB)\n**Opponent:** Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) - 193 chips\n**Action:** Seat 2 raised to 12 total (8 more to call)\n**Pot:** 16 chips (4 BB + 2 SB + 10 raise)\n\nFrom opponent history:\n- Seat 2 has raised preflop multiple times: Hand #28 (raise 12), Hand #31 (raise 12)\n- They showed K9o in a showdown (Hand #30)\n- They seem moderately active but not overly aggressive\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. Hand strength: J5o is a very weak hand. It's dominated by many hands that would raise from SB.\n2. Position: We're out of position (BB vs SB) - this is a disadvantage postflop.\n3. Pot odds: Need to call 8 to win 24 (current pot 16 + our 8 call). That's 1:3 odds (25% equity needed).\n4. Implied odds: Poor with J5o - we're unlikely to hit a strong hand that can win a big pot.\n5. Stack preservation: We have 41.2 BB, which is healthy. No need to defend with trash.\n\n**Decision:** This is an easy fold. J5o has terrible equity against a SB raising range. Even if opponent is stealing, we need a better hand to defend. The 8 chips to call represent 4.8% of our stack, not worth it with this hand.\n\nWe should wait for better spots.",

I need to call 10 more (since I already posted 2 as SB).\n\n**Pot size**: 18 chips currently (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise).\n\n**Opponent analysis**:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been raising frequently preflop - shows 8 raise actions in history, mostly 6 chips early, now 12 chips recently. Shows tendency to raise light. Showdown hand was K9o, so not premium.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): In BB, has been folding to raises recently (folded last 3 hands to raises).\n\n**My hand**: 4s5s suited connectors. This is a speculative hand that plays well multi-way but not great heads-up out of position. As suited connectors, we want implied odds and multi-way pots.\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. **Position**: We're out of position against the raiser (Seat 2). This is a big disadvantage.\n2. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18, we need to call 10. That's 1.8:1 odds (35.7% equity needed). 45s against a typical raising range has ~30-35% equity heads-up.\n3. **Implied odds**: If we hit a flush or straight, we could win a big pot. But being out of position makes it harder to realize that equity.\n4. **Stack sizes**: We have 40.8 BB, opponent has 49.25 BB. Not deep enough for great implied odds.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: We have a healthy stack, no need to take marginal spots out of position.\n\n**Alternatives**: We could consider a 3-bet bluff, but with 45s that's too speculative. Fold seems correct.\n\nThe BB might come along, but they've been folding to raises recently. Even if they call, we're still out of position against the preflop aggressor.\n\nGiven all this, folding seems like the correct play. We preserve our stack and wait for better spots in position or with stronger hands."

I need to call 10 more (since I already posted 2 as SB).\n\n**Pot size**: 18 chips currently (2 SB + 4 BB + 12 raise).\n\n**Opponent analysis**:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been raising frequently preflop - shows 8 raise actions in history, mostly 6 chips early, now 12 chips recently. Shows tendency to raise light. Showdown hand was K9o, so not premium.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): In BB, has been folding to raises recently (folded last 3 hands to raises).\n\n**My hand**: 4s5s suited connectors. This is a speculative hand that plays well multi-way but not great heads-up out of position. As suited connectors, we want implied odds and multi-way pots.\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. **Position**: We're out of position against the raiser (Seat 2). This is a big disadvantage.\n2. **Pot odds**: Pot is 18, we need to call 10. That's 1.8:1 odds (35.7% equity needed). 45s against a typical raising range has ~30-35% equity heads-up.\n3. **Implied odds**: If we hit a flush or straight, we could win a big pot. But being out of position makes it harder to realize that equity.\n4. **Stack sizes**: We have 40.8 BB, opponent has 49.25 BB. Not deep enough for great implied odds.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: We have a healthy stack, no need to take marginal spots out of position.\n\n**Alternatives**: We could consider a 3-bet bluff, but with 45s that's too speculative. Fold seems correct.\n\nThe BB might come along, but they've been folding to raises recently. Even if they call, we're still out of position against the preflop aggressor.\n\nGiven all this, folding seems like the correct play. We preserve our stack and wait for better spots in position or with stronger hands.",

Looking at the opponent tendencies:\n\n1. MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has been fairly active recently. In hand 37, they called 8 preflop and then bet on flop, turn, and river. They've called twice preflop and folded several times. They seem willing to defend their blinds.\n\n2. GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has folded preflop in all recent hands (hands 32-37). They seem very tight, especially from the BB.\n\nMy position is excellent (button) with 40.8 BB. The pot is 6 chips (SB + BB). I need to call 4 to see the flop.\n\nWith 9-6 offsuit, this is a very weak hand. However, being on the button against potentially weak opponents gives me some stealing opportunity. The BB has been folding a lot, and the SB might fold to a raise if they have a weak hand.\n\nLooking at my own history, I won hand 33 on the button with KTs by calling preflop and betting post-flop. My win rate is low (13.5%) with many folds.\n\nGiven the situation:\n- Hand strength: Very weak (9-6 offsuit, no suitedness)\n- Position: Excellent (button)\n- Opponent tendencies: BB folds a lot, SB defends sometimes\n- Stack size: 40.8 BB (healthy)\n- Pot odds: 4 to win 6 (1.5:1)\n\nThis is a marginal spot. The standard play with 9-6 offsuit would be to fold. However, given that both opponents have folded to me (SB and BB), and I'm on the button, I could consider a steal raise. But 9-6 is really weak for a steal attempt.\n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (40.8 BB), so I don't need to take big risks. Preserving chips is important.\n\nGiven the BB's tendency to fold and the SB's mixed tendencies, I think the best play is to fold. 9-6 offsuit plays terribly post-flop, and even if I steal the blinds, it's only 6 chips. The risk of getting called and playing a weak hand out of position post-flop (if SB calls and BB folds, I'll be out of position on the flop) isn't worth it.\n\nI'll fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm UTG with 6d 2d. This is an absolutely terrible hand to play from UTG. It's suited, but it's 62s - one of the worst starting hands in poker. From UTG, I should be playing a very tight range.\n\nLet me consider the table dynamics. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised preflop multiple times, including a recent raise to 12 in hand #29. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has also raised preflop frequently, with raises to 12, 14, etc. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has raised preflop, including a large raise to 30 in hand #24.\n\nI'm first to act after the blinds. With 62s, I'm in the worst possible position with a weak hand. If I call, I'll be out of position against the entire field. There are 4 players left to act behind me (seats 4, 5, and the blinds can still act if I just call).\n\nThe pot is 6 chips, and I need to call 4 chips (40.8 BB stack). That's 2.5% of my stack, but the problem is not the immediate cost - it's the positional disadvantage and the likelihood of facing raises behind me.\n\nGiven the aggressive tendencies I've observed from opponents, there's a high probability that someone will raise behind me, forcing me to either fold (wasting my 4 chips) or call more chips with a terrible hand.\n\nAlso, even if I see a flop, 62s has very limited potential. It needs to hit a flush draw or two pair/trips to have any real value, and even then, it's vulnerable to better flushes or higher two pairs.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 40.8 BB, which is a decent stack. Preserving my stack is important. Getting involved with 62s from UTG is a recipe for losing chips.\n\nThe only reasonable play here is to fold. Even calling is terrible because it sets me up for difficult decisions postflop out of position with a weak hand.\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to consider otherwise. Maybe if the table was very passive, but based on the recall data, there are multiple aggressive players who raise preflop frequently. This makes folding even more correct.\n\nMy decision: fold.",

Looking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot of marginal hands, which is reasonable. My stack is 163 chips (40.8 BB), which is a medium stack. The blinds are 2/4.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has been folding most hands preflop, but called a couple times and showed aggression postflop in hand #37.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) has been folding most hands preflop, only called once from SB in hand #39.\n\nThere are 4 players left to act after me (MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B, and the two Kimi-K2 players in blinds). J7o is a terrible hand to open from UTG. It has little postflop playability, is easily dominated, and has reverse implied odds (if I hit a J, I could be beat by better jacks).\n\nWith 40.8 BB, I should preserve my stack and wait for better spots. The pot is only 6 chips, and calling 4 chips would commit me to a hand that's likely to lose money postflop. Raising would be even worse with this hand from UTG.\n\nThe correct play is to fold. I should wait for better position and better hands to accumulate chips. My tournament life is more important than playing J7o from UTG.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Position:** I'm in the BB with 5s 2s, which is a very weak hand - 52s suited. Small blind (Seat 2) just completed the small blind to 8 total (called the additional 4). \n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 155 chips (19.4 BB), opponent has 153 chips. We're both similarly stacked.\n\n**Hand strength:** 52s is a very weak hand. As suited connectors go, it's one of the weakest. It has some speculative value if we hit a flush draw or straight draw, but generally should be folded from the BB when facing any raise. However, here the SB just completed, so I'm getting to see a free flop.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at Seat 2's actions, they have:\n- Folded preflop 6 times\n- Raised preflop 2 times (both to 12 chips)\n- Called once on the flop, turn, then folded river in hand #37\n\nThey seem fairly tight, folding most hands. The fact they just completed the small blind suggests they have a marginal hand they don't want to raise with but don't want to fold either.\n\n**Pot odds:** The pot is 16 chips (8 from me, 4 from SB, 4 from antes?). I have 0 to call, so I'm getting infinite pot odds to see a flop.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 19.4 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate. I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips, but also preserving my stack.\n\n**Decision:** With 52s suited, I should just check and see a free flop. There's no reason to raise with such a weak hand out of position against an opponent who likely has a marginal hand. Raising would be spewy - I'd be bloating the pot out of position with a weak hand. Folding would be giving up a free chance to potentially hit a big hand.\n\nThe best play is to check and see a flop. If I hit something like a flush draw or straight draw, I can continue. Otherwise, I can easily fold on the flop.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Getting to see a free flop with 52s suited from BB.

          "content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I'm in the BB with 5s2s. The board is 6s Kc Ad 3d. I have a small flush draw (spades) and a gutshot straight draw (I have 5-2, board has 6-A-3, so I need a 4 for a straight). Actually, let me check: I have 5-2, board is 6-K-A-3. I need a 4 to complete 2-3-4-5-6 straight. That's 4 outs. For the flush, I have 5s2s, board has 6s (one spade). So I have a flush draw with 9 remaining spades. However, the board has 3d (another diamond), so there's also a diamond draw possible. But I only have spades.\n\nPot is 28, opponent bet 12. So I need to call 12 to win 40 (28+12). That's pot odds of 12:40 or 3:10, meaning I need about 23% equity to call.\n\nLet me estimate my equity. I have a gutshot (4 outs) and a flush draw (9 outs). But some of these might overlap (4s would be both a straight and a spade). Actually 4s would be both. So total unique outs: 4 for straight (4c, 4h, 4d, 4s) and 8 more spades (since 4s already counted). That's 12 outs. But wait, 4d is a diamond, which might complete a diamond flush if opponent has diamonds. But anyway, 12 outs is about 12 * 2 = 24% equity on the river (using rule of 2). Actually with one card to come, each out is about 2%. So 12 outs is about 24%. That's barely above the 23% needed.\n\nBut there are complications: Some of my outs might not be clean. If opponent has a better hand like two pair or a set, my flush might not be good if the board pairs. Also, opponent might have a diamond draw themselves. But given the small bet (12 into 28), this seems like a weak bet, possibly a probe bet or a draw themselves.\n\nLooking at opponent history: Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot preflop. They raised preflop in hands 36 and 37. In hand 37, they called flop and turn bets then folded river. So they seem somewhat passive postflop. They limped preflop this hand (called SB to complete). That suggests a weak hand, maybe small pocket pair, suited connectors, or weak ace.\n\nGiven the board A-K-6-3, if they had a strong ace (AK, AQ, AJ) they might have raised preflop. More likely they have a medium pocket pair, a weak ace (A2-A5), or a draw. Their bet of 12 into 28 is small, about 43% pot. This could be a blocking bet with a weak hand or a draw.\n\nMy hand has decent equity with draws. I have position (they acted first on turn). If I call, I get to see river and can evaluate. My stack is 155, so calling 12 is about 8% of my stack. Not huge.\n\nHowever, I should consider implied odds: If I hit my flush or straight, I might get paid more. But my stack is relatively short (19BB), so implied odds are limited. Also, if I miss, I'll have to fold to a river bet.\n\nGiven the pot odds and estimated equity, it's a close decision. The 24% equity vs 23% needed suggests a slight call. But there's also the possibility of raising as a semi-bluff. I have 12 outs, which is decent. A raise could fold out weak aces or pairs. But my hand is very weak otherwise, and if called, I'm committed with a draw.\n\nGiven my tournament position (19BB, not super short but not deep), I should be cautious. However, the pot is small relative to stacks. Let me think about stack sizes: I have 155, opponent has 141. If I call, pot becomes 40, and I'll have 143 left. If I raise, minimum raise to 24 (double the bet). That would be 24 total, putting 36 more in (24-8 already in BB?). Wait, I already put in 8 as BB. So I'd need to add 16 more to make it 24 total. Actually, \"raise_to\" is total amount. So if I raise to 24, that means I put 24 total, which is 16 more (since I already have 8 in). That's reasonable.\n\nBut raising commits"

More likely they have a medium pocket pair, a weak ace (A2-A5), or a draw. Their bet of 12 into 28 is small, about 43% pot. This could be a blocking bet with a weak hand or a draw.\n\nMy hand has decent equity with draws. I have position (they acted first on turn). If I call, I get to see river and can evaluate. My stack is 155, so calling 12 is about 8% of my stack. Not huge.\n\nHowever, I should consider implied odds: If I hit my flush or straight, I might get paid more. But my stack is relatively short (19BB), so implied odds are limited. Also, if I miss, I'll have to fold to a river bet.\n\nGiven the pot odds and estimated equity, it's a close decision. The 24% equity vs 23% needed suggests a slight call. But there's also the possibility of raising as a semi-bluff. I have 12 outs, which is decent. A raise could fold out weak aces or pairs. But my hand is very weak otherwise, and if called, I'm committed with a draw.\n\nGiven my tournament position (19BB, not super short but not deep), I should be cautious. However, the pot is small relative to stacks. Let me think about stack sizes: I have 155, opponent has 141. If I call, pot becomes 40, and I'll have 143 left. If I raise, minimum raise to 24 (double the bet). That would be 24 total, putting 36 more in (24-8 already in BB?). Wait, I already put in 8 as BB. So I'd need to add 16 more to make it 24 total. Actually, \"raise_to\" is total amount. So if I raise to 24, that means I put 24 total, which is 16 more (since I already have 8 in). That's reasonable.\n\nBut raising commits",

          "reasoning_content": "Looking at opponent's actions: Kimi-K2 tends to be somewhat passive postflop. They've called bets on flop and turn in hand 30, then checked river. In hand 32, they checked turn and bet small on river (8 into likely small pot). They raised preflop in hands 31, 36, 37. In hand 37, they called flop and turn bets then folded river. So they seem to call with draws or medium strength hands, but fold when they don't improve.\n\nIn this hand, they limped preflop (called SB), which suggests a weak hand. Then they checked flop and bet small on turn (12 into 28). This could be a probe bet with a weak pair or a draw. Given the board A-K-6-3, they might have a weak ace (A2-A5), a small pair (44-99), or a draw like diamonds or a straight draw.\n\nMy hand: 5s2s. I have a flush draw (9 outs) and gutshot straight draw (4 outs, but 4s overlaps). So about 12 outs total. Pot odds: need to call 12 to win 40 (28+12). That's 30% pot odds (12/40=0.3). I need about 30% equity. My estimated equity with 12 outs is about 24% (using rule of 2 for one card). Actually 12 outs is 12/46 \u2248 26%. Close.\n\nBut there's also implied odds if I hit. However, my stack is only 155 (19BB), so implied odds are limited. Also, some of my outs might not be clean: if opponent has a better flush draw (with higher spades), or if the board pairs and they have a set.\n\nGiven the small bet size (43% pot), opponent likely has a weak hand. They might fold to a raise. A semi-bluff raise could work. If I raise to say 36 (triple the bet), that would be 36 total, meaning I put in 28 more (since I already have 8). That would be a significant portion of my stack (28/155 \u2248 18%). If called, I'd have about 127 left with pot of ~76, giving me about 1.7:1 odds on river.\n\nBut raising commits me. Calling seems better: I get to see river with decent equity, and if I miss, I can fold. If I hit, I can bet for value. My position is good (I act last on river).\n\nGiven the close equity and pot odds, and the fact that opponent's bet seems weak, I'll call. It's a small investment (12 chips, 8% of stack) with reasonable chance to improve.\n\nLet me also consider tournament strategy: With 19BB, I'm not in dire need to gamble, but this is a small pot. I should preserve chips for better spots. However, the pot odds justify a call with a draw.\n\nI'll call.",

          "content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nHand: 5s 2s\nBoard: 6s Kc Ad 3d Jh\n\nMy hand is terrible - just 5-high with no pair, no draw. I have a flush draw that missed (only 2 spades on board, I have 2 spades, but board shows 6s, so there's only 1 spade on board actually). Wait, board shows 6s, Kc, Ad, 3d, Jh - so there's exactly one spade (6s). I have 5s 2s, so I have two spades, making a flush draw, but only one spade on board, so no flush.\n\nBest possible hand: 5-high straight? Board is 6-K-A-3-J. For a straight, I'd need 4-5 or 5-7. I have 5-2, so no straight either.\n\nI'm basically playing the board with 5-high. The board shows A-K-J-6-3. So the best hand on board is Ace-high with K kicker.\n\nOpponent (Seat 2) has 117 chips. They bet 12 on turn, now 24 on river. Pot is 64 chips, I need to call 24.\n\nFrom opponent history: They showed K9 in hand #30 and won with two pair. They've been fairly active preflop with some raises. On river bets, I see they bet 8 in hand #32 on river. In hand #37 they folded to a river bet.\n\nLooking at this hand: Preflop they just called SB, I checked BB. Flop checked through. Turn they bet 12 into ~32 pot (8+8+16? Actually: SB 4, BB 8, call 4 = 16 pot preflop). So turn pot was 16, they bet 12 (75% pot). River pot is now 40 (16+12+12), they bet 24 (60% pot).\n\nThis looks like value betting. With board A-K-6-3-J, what hands would they value bet? Possibly A-x, K-x, maybe two pair, maybe even a straight? They could have 45 for straight (4-5 would make straight on turn with 6-3-A-4-5, but board is 6-K-A-3-J, so 45 would make straight on river with 3-4-5-6-7? No, 45 would need 2-3-4-5-6 or 4-5-6-7-8). Actually 45 makes straight with 2-3-4-5-6 or 3-4-5-6-7 or 4-5-6-7-8. Board has 6-3-A-J-K, so no.\n\nWhat about 24 for straight? 2-3-4-5-6? Board has 6-3, so 2-4-5 would make straight. I have 5-2, so they could have 4-2 or 4-5.\n\nBut more likely they have A-x or K-x. They're small blind, so range is wide.\n\nMy hand is basically bluff catcher, but I have the worst possible bluff catcher - 5-high. If they're bluffing, they could have any two cards. But would they bluff this river? Board is fairly dry - A-K high, no flush possible, only straights are 45 or 24.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 24 to win 88 (64+24). That's about 3.7:1 odds, need ~21% equity.\n\nDo I have 21% chance to win? Against a reasonable value range (A-x, K-x, maybe two pair, sets), I have near 0%. Against a bluff range, I have maybe 50% if they have complete air.\n\nBut would they bluff here? They bet turn and river, which looks like value. Bluffs would often give up on river after being called on turn.\n\nAlso tournament considerations: I have 143 chips (17.9 BB). Calling 24 would leave me with 119 chips (14.9 BB). Not a huge difference.\n\nBut this is a terrible spot to call with 5-high. Even if they're bluffing, they could have a better high card like Q-high or 8-high.\n\nI should fold. This is a clear fold. Let me check if there's any history of opponent bluffing rivers. From the data, I see they bet 8 on river in hand #32 and bet this river. Not much data.\n\nBut with my hand strength, it's an easy fold."

They bet 12 on turn, now 24 on river. Pot is 64 chips, I need to call 24.\n\nFrom opponent history: They showed K9 in hand #30 and won with two pair. They've been fairly active preflop with some raises. On river bets, I see they bet 8 in hand #32 on river. In hand #37 they folded to a river bet.\n\nLooking at this hand: Preflop they just called SB, I checked BB. Flop checked through. Turn they bet 12 into ~32 pot (8+8+16? Actually: SB 4, BB 8, call 4 = 16 pot preflop). So turn pot was 16, they bet 12 (75% pot). River pot is now 40 (16+12+12), they bet 24 (60% pot).\n\nThis looks like value betting. With board A-K-6-3-J, what hands would they value bet? Possibly A-x, K-x, maybe two pair, maybe even a straight? They could have 45 for straight (4-5 would make straight on turn with 6-3-A-4-5, but board is 6-K-A-3-J, so 45 would make straight on river with 3-4-5-6-7? No, 45 would need 2-3-4-5-6 or 4-5-6-7-8). Actually 45 makes straight with 2-3-4-5-6 or 3-4-5-6-7 or 4-5-6-7-8. Board has 6-3-A-J-K, so no.\n\nWhat about 24 for straight? 2-3-4-5-6? Board has 6-3, so 2-4-5 would make straight. I have 5-2, so they could have 4-2 or 4-5.\n\nBut more likely they have A-x or K-x. They're small blind, so range is wide.\n\nMy hand is basically bluff catcher, but I have the worst possible bluff catcher - 5-high. If they're bluffing, they could have any two cards. But would they bluff this river? Board is fairly dry - A-K high, no flush possible, only straights are 45 or 24.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 24 to win 88 (64+24). That's about 3.7:1 odds, need ~21% equity.\n\nDo I have 21% chance to win? Against a reasonable value range (A-x, K-x, maybe two pair, sets), I have near 0%. Against a bluff range, I have maybe 50% if they have complete air.\n\nBut would they bluff here? They bet turn and river, which looks like value. Bluffs would often give up on river after being called on turn.\n\nAlso tournament considerations: I have 143 chips (17.9 BB). Calling 24 would leave me with 119 chips (14.9 BB). Not a huge difference.\n\nBut this is a terrible spot to call with 5-high. Even if they're bluffing, they could have a better high card like Q-high or 8-high.\n\nI should fold. This is a clear fold. Let me check if there's any history of opponent bluffing rivers. From the data, I see they bet 8 on river in hand #32 and bet this river. Not much data.\n\nBut with my hand strength, it's an easy fold.",

The blinds are 4/8, so I have to call 8 chips to see the flop.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has been mostly folding preflop, but raised once (hand 39).\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Mostly folding preflop, called once from BB (hand 41).\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has been folding a lot preflop, called once from SB (hand 43).\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Has been folding a lot, raised once (hand 40), called once (hand 39).\n\nI'm first to act preflop. With A6s from UTG, standard tournament strategy would be to fold this hand. It's too weak to open from early position. Even though it's suited, it has reverse implied odds - if I hit an ace, I could be dominated by better aces. Also, there are 4 players left to act behind me who could have stronger hands.\n\nMy stack is 18.9 BB, which is getting into push/fold territory, but not quite there yet.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI'm on the button with Qs 5c, which is a marginal hand. My stack is 143 chips (17.9 BB), which is short but not critically short. The opponent in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 16 total (2x BB raise from 8 to 16). Looking at the opponent's history from seat 4: they've been folding a lot preflop (7 folds out of 10 actions), called once, and bet postflop in a couple of hands. They don't seem overly aggressive preflop.\n\nThe pot is currently 28 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 16). I need to call 8 more chips to continue. That's 5.6% of my stack.\n\nFactors to consider:\n1. Hand strength: Q5o is a weak hand. Offsuit with no connectivity. Queen-high is not great.\n2. Position: I'm on the button, which is good position, but against a single raiser.\n3. Stack sizes: I have 143 chips, opponent has 255 chips. If I call, I'll have 135 left after calling (8 chips).\n4. Tournament considerations: With 17.9 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate. I should be looking for better spots.\n5. Pot odds: I need to call 8 to win 28, which is 3.5:1 odds (22% equity needed). Q5o has about 29% equity against a typical raising range, so mathematically it might be a call.\n6. Implied odds: As the button, I have position advantage, but with such a weak hand, I'll likely have to fold to continuation bets unless I hit something good.\n\nHowever, Q5o is a hand that flops poorly - it needs to hit two pair or better to feel comfortable. The queen-high flop can be dominated easily.\n\nLooking at my own history: I've been folding a lot (38 folds out of 45 hands), which suggests I'm playing tight. I won recently with AA from CO.\n\nGiven my short stack and the weak nature of Q5o, I think folding is correct. I should wait for better spots. The 8 chips to call is small, but it's still 5.6% of my stack, and I'll likely have to fold to most flops. Better to preserve my stack for a better hand.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm UTG (under the gun) with AQ offsuit (Qd As). My stack is 139 chips (17.4 BB). Blinds are 4/8. The pot is 12 chips. SB (Seat 5) posted 4, BB (Seat 1) posted 8, and Seat 2 folded. I need to call 8 to play.\n\nLooking at my position: UTG is the worst position preflop - I have to act first after the flop. However, AQ is a strong hand, especially in a tournament with 17.4 BB stack.\n\nFrom the search results, I can see some patterns:\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1, BB) has shown some aggression - in hand 39 they raised from BB with 6d 2d after a limper.\n2. MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) has raised preflop in recent hands (hands 46 and 48).\n3. GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB) has shown some aggression too.\n\nMy stack is 139 chips. If I just call 8, the pot will be 20 chips, and I'll have 131 behind. This is a bit shallow for post-flop play but manageable.\n\nWith AQ UTG, standard play is usually to raise. However, with my stack depth (17.4 BB), I need to consider tournament implications. I'm not super short, but not deep either.\n\nOptions:\n1. Fold: Too tight for AQ with 17.4 BB\n2. Call: Could be okay but puts me in a tricky spot post-flop OOP\n3. Raise: Standard play with a strong hand\n\nIf I raise, minimum raise is to 16 (double the BB). But a standard raise would be 2.5-3x, so 20-24 chips. My stack is 139, so raising to 24 would commit 17% of my stack preflop.\n\nGiven my position and stack, I think raising is best. I want to take initiative and possibly win the pot preflop. If I get called, I have a strong hand that can flop well.\n\nLet me check if there are any recent hands where players have shown particular tendencies. From hand 39, Kimi-K2 Thinking raised from BB with 62s after a limper, showing they can be aggressive. In hand 44, I raised with AA and everyone folded.\n\nI should raise to around 20-24 chips. Let's say 24 chips (3x BB). This is a standard raise size.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"AQo is a strong hand UTG.

I need to call 8 chips or raise to at least 16 total.\n\nFrom opponent history:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): No data, but based on name might be more aggressive/thinking\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has been folding a lot recently (7 straight folds after hand 41)\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has raised twice preflop (hands 46 and 48) and called once\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Raised once preflop (hand 45), otherwise mostly folding\n\nMy own history shows I've been folding a lot (41 folds in 49 hands), but just won hand 49 with AQ from CO.\n\nAJo from UTG is a marginal hand. In tournament poker with 18.9 BB, this is a tricky spot. Standard play with this stack depth is either:\n1. Fold (tight play, preserve stack)\n2. Raise (standard 2.5x-3x)\n3. Shove (all-in with 18.9 BB)\n\nGiven my position (UTG) and the fact there are 4 players left to act, raising is risky. If I raise to say 24 (3x), that's 16% of my stack, and I'll be out of position against any callers. \n\nThe alternative is to go all-in, which puts pressure on everyone. With 18.9 BB, a shove from UTG with AJo could be reasonable, though it's somewhat loose. \n\nGiven the opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot, MiniMax-M2 has shown aggression but not excessive, GPT-OSS-120B mostly folds.

I need to call 8 chips or raise to at least 16 total.\n\nFrom opponent history:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): No data, but based on name might be more aggressive/thinking\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Has been folding a lot recently (7 straight folds after hand 41)\n- MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4): Has raised twice preflop (hands 46 and 48) and called once\n- GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5): Raised once preflop (hand 45), otherwise mostly folding\n\nMy own history shows I've been folding a lot (41 folds in 49 hands), but just won hand 49 with AQ from CO.\n\nAJo from UTG is a marginal hand. In tournament poker with 18.9 BB, this is a tricky spot. Standard play with this stack depth is either:\n1. Fold (tight play, preserve stack)\n2. Raise (standard 2.5x-3x)\n3. Shove (all-in with 18.9 BB)\n\nGiven my position (UTG) and the fact there are 4 players left to act, raising is risky. If I raise to say 24 (3x), that's 16% of my stack, and I'll be out of position against any callers. \n\nThe alternative is to go all-in, which puts pressure on everyone. With 18.9 BB, a shove from UTG with AJo could be reasonable, though it's somewhat loose. \n\nGiven the opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot, MiniMax-M2 has shown aggression but not excessive, GPT-OSS-120B mostly folds. They might all fold to a shove, which would win the 12 chip pot.\n\nBut I should consider ICM implications in a tournament. With 18.9 BB, I'm not in dire straits yet. I could fold and wait for a better spot.\n\nHowever, AJo has decent equity against random hands. Let me think about the math:\n- If I shove 151 into 12, I need folds about 88% of the time (151/(151+12) \u2248 92.6% actually)\n- But the blinds will call with some range\n- With 4 players left to act, the chance all fold is lower\n\nActually, let me calculate: If each player calls with top 10% of hands, chance all fold = 0.9^4 = 65.6%.

Options: fold, call, raise to at least 16. \n\nMy analysis: AJo from UTG is marginal. With 18.9 BB, not desperate. Tournament considerations favor preserving stack. Calling 8 chips (5.3% of stack) to play AJo out of position multiway is bad. Raising commits too much of stack or risks getting called/raised by later positions. \n\nOpponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 folds a lot, MiniMax-M2 somewhat aggressive, GPT-OSS-120B mostly folds.

I need to call 8 more chips to continue.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot preflop (14 out of 20 recorded actions are folds). They've only called twice and bet once. They showed down Kd 9h in hand #30. Their recent actions show they folded preflop in hands 38-49, then called in hand 50. Now they're raising from SB.\n\nThis could be a steal attempt from SB. With Kh 7s, I have a marginal hand - king-high with weak kicker. However, I'm getting good pot odds: pot is 24 chips (8 from me as BB, 4 from SB, plus 12 more from SB raise), I need to call 8 more. That's 3:1 pot odds (24:8).\n\nMy stack is 143 chips, opponent has 137 chips. If I call, pot will be 32 chips, and effective stack will be ~135 chips behind.\n\nGiven opponent's tight folding tendencies, this raise might be a steal attempt with a wide range. Kh 7s has some value against steal attempts. However, being out of position (they act after me postflop) is a disadvantage.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 17.9 BB, which is getting short but not critical yet. Folding preserves my stack but gives up the pot. Calling could lead to difficult postflop decisions out of position.\n\nLet me check if there are any other relevant patterns. Looking at my own history, I've been folding a lot too (42 folds out of 50 hands). I've won a couple pots with premium hands (AA, AQ).\n\nGiven the pot odds and opponent's likely wide stealing range, I think a call is reasonable. However, Kh 7s is pretty weak. The king is good, but 7 is a terrible kicker. I'll be dominated by any king with better kicker.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The opponent raised from SB after many folds. This could be a sign of strength or a steal. With my stack size, maybe I should 3-bet to apply pressure? Minimum raise to is 24 (total). That would be putting in 16 more chips (24 total). But with Kh 7s, I don't want to play a big pot.\n\nI think the best play is to fold. Kh 7s is too weak to call a raise, even with good pot odds, because I'll be out of position and likely dominated. Folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\nWait, but if this is a steal attempt, I should defend. Let me think about opponent's range. SB raising range could be wide: maybe top 30-40% of hands.

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm in the BB with Kh 7s. My stack is 143 chips (17.9 BB). The SB (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) raised to 16 total (which is a min-raise from 8 to 16). I need to call 8 more chips to continue.\n\nLooking at opponent data: Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot preflop (14 out of 20 recorded actions are folds). They've only called twice and bet once. They showed down Kd 9h in hand #30. Their recent actions show they folded preflop in hands 38-49, then called in hand 50. Now they're raising from SB.\n\nThis could be a steal attempt from SB. With Kh 7s, I have a marginal hand - king-high with weak kicker. However, I'm getting good pot odds: pot is 24 chips (8 from me as BB, 4 from SB, plus 12 more from SB raise), I need to call 8 more. That's 3:1 pot odds (24:8).\n\nMy stack is 143 chips, opponent has 137 chips. If I call, pot will be 32 chips, and effective stack will be ~135 chips behind.\n\nGiven opponent's tight folding tendencies, this raise might be a steal attempt with a wide range. Kh 7s has some value against steal attempts. However, being out of position (they act after me postflop) is a disadvantage.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 17.9 BB, which is getting short but not critical yet. Folding preserves my stack but gives up the pot. Calling could lead to difficult postflop decisions out of position.\n\nLet me check if there are any other relevant patterns. Looking at my own history, I've been folding a lot too (42 folds out of 50 hands). I've won a couple pots with premium hands (AA, AQ).\n\nGiven the pot odds and opponent's likely wide stealing range, I think a call is reasonable. However, Kh 7s is pretty weak. The king is good, but 7 is a terrible kicker. I'll be dominated by any king with better kicker.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The opponent raised from SB after many folds. This could be a sign of strength or a steal. With my stack size, maybe I should 3-bet to apply pressure? Minimum raise to is 24 (total). That would be putting in 16 more chips (24 total). But with Kh 7s, I don't want to play a big pot.\n\nI think the best play is to fold. Kh 7s is too weak to call a raise, even with good pot odds, because I'll be out of position and likely dominated. Folding preserves my stack for better spots.\n\nWait, but if this is a steal attempt, I should defend. Let me think about opponent's range. SB raising range could be wide: maybe top 30-40% of hands. Kh 7s is probably around 30-35% percentile. So it's borderline.\n\nGiven tournament dynamics and my position, I'll fold. I need a better hand to continue against a raise, even from SB.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 6s 3s - Suited connectors but very low (6-3 suited). This is a weak hand, especially from the small blind.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the small blind, which is a terrible position post-flop. I'll have to act first on every street after the flop.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - I have 139 chips (17.4 BB) - short stacked\n   - Kimi-K2 (raiser) has 137 chips (similar stack)\n   - MiniMax-M2 in BB has 287 chips (deep stack)\n\n4. **Action**: Kimi-K2 raised to 24 total (3x BB). Looking at the opponent history, Kimi-K2 has been folding a lot (14 folds in last 20 actions). They raised last hand (Hand #51) to 16 (2x BB), and now raised to 24 (3x BB). This suggests they might be opening up their raising range, possibly sensing weakness or trying to steal blinds.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Pot is 36 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24). I need to call 20 to win 56 (36+20). That's about 1:2.8 pot odds, or about 26% equity needed.\n\n6. **Hand equity**: 6-3 suited against a likely raising range (maybe top 20-30% of hands) has around 25-30% equity preflop. However, position disadvantage reduces this significantly.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 17.4 BB, I'm short but not critically short. I should be looking for better spots, especially since I have position disadvantage.\n\n8. **Potential outcomes**: \n   - If I call, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position with a short stack. \n   - If I raise, I'd be committing a significant portion of my stack with a very weak hand.\n   - The BB (MiniMax-M2) still has to act behind me with a deep stack, which could squeeze.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- Hand is very weak (6-3 suited)\n- Terrible position (SB)\n- Short stack but not desperate\n- Pot odds are borderline but position disadvantage makes it worse\n- Opponent has been tight but raised last hand too, possibly expanding range\n\nThis is an easy fold. I should wait for a better spot with better position or a stronger hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"6-3 suited is too weak from SB facing a raise.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze this situation. I'm UTG with 8d9d, a suited connector. My stack is 139 chips (17.4 BB). The blinds are 4/8. I'm first to act preflop. Seat 2 has already folded. \n\nFrom my hand history, I've been folding a lot of marginal hands, which makes sense. From opponent data:\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has raised twice preflop (hand 46 and 48) and folded most other times\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, SB) raised once preflop (hand 45) and folded most times\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, BB) raised once preflop (hand 50) and folded most times\n\n8d9s is a speculative hand. Being UTG with a short stack (17.4 BB), I need to be careful. Suited connectors can be playable, but from UTG with this stack size, it's marginal. The pot is 12 chips, and I need to call 8 chips (about 5.8% of my stack).\n\nIf I call, there are 3 players left to act behind me: MiniMax-M2 (MP), GPT-OSS-120B (CO), and Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB). They could raise, which would put me in a tough spot.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy with a short stack, I should either be raising with strong hands or folding marginal ones. 8d9d is not strong enough to open-raise from UTG with 17.4 BB. Calling invites trouble from players behind.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 20 (12 pot + 8 call), which is 2.5:1 or 28.6%. 8d9d has about 20% equity against a random hand, but worse against a raising range. Implied odds could be decent if I hit a strong draw, but with my short stack, I don't have much room to maneuver.\n\nGiven my position and stack size, folding is the prudent play. I should wait for better spots.",

Q9s is not a premium hand, and being in early position makes it even worse.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has raised preflop in 2 of last 10 hands, but mostly folds. Recently has folded 7 straight times.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised once (to 24) in last 10 hands, called once, otherwise mostly folds.\n\nMy own history shows I've been folding a lot (46 folds out of 54 hands, 7 wins). I won hand #49 with AQ from CO position with a raise.\n\nStack sizes: I have 139 chips (17.4 BB), which is relatively short but not critical. Seat 4 has 283 (35 BB), Seat 5 has 258 (32 BB).\n\nWith Q9s from UTG, this is a clear fold in tournament poker. Reasons:\n1. Hand strength is weak - Q9s is not strong enough to open from UTG\n2. Position is terrible - I'll be out of position against all remaining players\n3. Stack preservation - With 17.4 BB, I can't afford to play speculative hands OOP\n4. Better spots - I should wait for better opportunities in later positions\n5. Risk of being 3-bet - Players behind might have stronger ranges\n\nThe pot odds are 8 to call into 12 pot (2:3), but that doesn't justify playing this weak hand OOP.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

That's 3:1 pot odds (25% equity needed).\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 17.4 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate.

That's 3:1 pot odds (25% equity needed).\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 17.4 BB, I'm getting short but not desperate. I need to preserve chips for better spots.\n\n**Decision:**\n- 9d 2s has very little equity even against random hands\n- While position is good, this hand is so weak it's unlikely to improve meaningfully\n- The BB has been folding a lot, but if they do play, they'll likely have a better hand\n- Completing here commits me to playing a terrible hand out of position postflop\n- Better to fold and wait for a better spot\n\nEven though it's only 4 more chips to call, playing ",

Shows some aggression when they do play.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been folding most hands, called once from the BB in hand 54.\n\nI'm on the button, which is a good position, but K3o is just too weak to play. Even from the button, this hand has very little value. With a small stack of 17.4 BB, I should be looking for better spots. The pot is only 12 chips, and I need to call 8 chips to see a flop. That's 5.8% of my stack for a very marginal hand.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 8 to win 20 (12 pot + 8 call), so 2.5:1 odds. But with K3o, I'm dominated by any hand with a king, and even when I hit a king, my kicker is weak. The reverse implied odds are bad - I could easily lose a lot when I hit top pair with weak kicker.\n\nGiven my stack size and tournament considerations, I should preserve my chips for better opportunities. I've been folding a lot of hands recently (looking at my history), which is reasonable given my stack size and the need to pick good spots.\n\nBetter to wait for a stronger hand or a better situation.

Even if I raise and get folds, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position against potentially strong hands if someone calls.\n\nAlso, Kimi-K2 Thinking in the BB might defend with a decent range given they have 135 chips (16.9 BB). They've shown some aggression with raises in the past.\n\nThe pot is 12 chips, and I need to call 8 to see a flop. That's 5.8% of my stack. While the pot odds are decent (1.5:1), implied odds with Q2s are poor because even if I hit a flush draw or pair, I'll be out of position and the hand is easily dominated.\n\nTournament considerations: With 17.4 BB, I'm in push/fold territory but not quite there yet. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nLooking at my recent hands, I've been folding a lot (folded 49 of 58 hands, won 8). This shows I'm playing tight, which is correct for tournament poker.\n\nBest play here is to fold Q2s from UTG.

In early position with 2-4 offsuit, standard poker strategy is to fold. This hand has almost no value and playing it from early position is a recipe for losing chips.\n\nEven if I call 8 chips, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand with a hand that rarely improves meaningfully. The implied odds are poor because even if I hit something like a pair of 2s or 4s, it's vulnerable and unlikely to win at showdown.\n\nTournament considerations: With 17.4 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. This is not a spot to get involved.\n\nThe pot odds: 8 to call into a pot of 20 (12 + my 8), so I need ~28% equity. 2-4 offsuit has maybe 20% equity against random hands, and worse against the ranges that will continue after UTG call.\n\nGiven all this, folding is the clear and correct play.

Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 143, which is effectively an all-in since they have 0 chips? Wait, Seat 1 has 0 chips and is \"out\"? Actually the description says \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 0 chips (out)\". That seems like they're already out of the tournament but still in the hand? That's confusing.\n\nLet me check: Seat 1 has 0 chips but raised 143? That doesn't make sense unless they're all-in with 0? Maybe it's a misprint. Let me re-read: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 0 chips (out)\" - maybe they're eliminated but still showing? The action says \"preflop: Seat 1 raise 143\". If they have 0 chips, they can't raise 143. Something is off.\n\nActually, looking at the stacks: I have 123, Seat 2 has 157 (folded), Seat 4 has 295 (folded), Seat 5 has 258 (folded). Seat 1 has 0 chips but raised? Maybe they're all-in with their last 0? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, maybe \"out\" means they're out of the hand? But then they wouldn't be acting. Or maybe it's a display issue - they have some chips but it shows 0.\n\nLet me think: The pot is 167 chips. Blinds are 8/16. SB posted 8, BB posted 16. That's 24 in the pot. Seat 4 and 5 folded. Then Seat 1 raised to 143. That would put 143 + 24 = 167 pot. Yes, that matches.\n\nBut if Seat 1 has 0 chips, they can't raise. So likely they have chips but it's showing 0 incorrectly, or \"out\" means something else.\n\nAnyway, I need to decide. I have 9d 2s, a terrible hand. I have 123 chips total. I already have 16 in as BB. To call, I need to put in 127 more, which would leave me with 0 (123 - 127 = -4? Actually 123 - 127 = -4, but I can't have negative). Wait, I have 123 total, I already put 16, so I have 107 left. To call 127, I'd need to put all 107 remaining? Let's calculate: My stack: 123 total. I already posted BB of 16, so I have 107 behind. The raise is to 143 total. I need to put in 143 - 16 = 127 more. But I only have 107 behind. So I can call all-in for 107 more. Actually, the amount to call is 127, but I only have 107 behind. So I can go all-in for my remaining 107.\n\nThe pot would then be: My 123 + opponent's 143? Let's think: If I go all-in for 123 total (my stack), opponent raised to 143, but they only need to match my all-in of 123? Actually, in poker, if I go all-in for less than their raise, they only need to call the difference to match my all-in. So if I go all-in for 123 total, they raised to 143, they would get back 20 (143-123=20) as change if they want to just call my all-in.\n\nBut the interface says \"Amount to call: 127\". That suggests I need to put 127 more to call. But I only have 107 behind. So maybe I can call all-in for 107 more, making my total contribution 16 + 107 = 123.\n\nLet me check the pot size: 167 chips. That includes: SB 8 + BB 16 + raise 143? Actually 8+16+143=167. Yes.\n\nIf I call all-in for 107 more (total 123), the pot becomes: 167 (current) + 107 (my call) = 274. Opponent has 0 chips? Wait they have 0 chips according to display, but they raised 143. So they must have at least 143 chips. Actually they raised 143, so they have at least 143 chips. But display says 0 chips. This is confusing.\n\nMaybe \"out\" means they're all-in? Like they're \"out\" of chips? But they raised 143, so they had chips.\n\nLet me use tools to get more information about opponents. First, let me recall opponent actions for Seat 1"

My stack is 123 chips (7.7 BB). Pot is 167. Amount to call is 127, but I only have 107 behind (since I already put 16 as BB). So I can call all-in for my remaining 107. The hand is very weak - 9d 2s is one of the worst possible hands. The opponent raised preflop, likely with a strong hand. With my short stack of 7.7 BB, I need to consider tournament survival. But calling with 9d 2s is terrible. Even with pot odds: pot is 167, I need to call 107. That's pot odds of 167:107, or about 1.56:1, meaning I need about 39% equity. 9d 2s has maybe 30% equity against a reasonable raising range. Actually worse. Against a top 20% range, 9d 2s has about 32% equity. So pot odds might justify a call if I think opponent is raising wide. But with my short stack, I should be looking for better spots. However, I'm getting decent pot odds: I'm putting in 107 to win 274 (167 current pot + my 107 call). That's 107 to win 274, or 2.56:1 pot odds. Wait, recalc: If I call all-in for 107 more, total pot would be: 167 (current) + 107 (my call) = 274. I'm contributing 107/274 = 39% of pot, so I need 39% equity. Against a random hand, 9d 2s has about 40% equity. Against a top 50% range, it has about 36%. Against a top 20% range, about 32%. So it's close.\n\nBut I need to consider opponent tendencies. Let me try to use tools quickly, but the system says invalid format. I need to just make a decision. I'll fold. 9d 2s is too weak, and with my short but not desperate stack (7.7 BB), I can wait for a better spot. Folding leaves me with 107 chips (6.7 BB), which is still playable. Calling and losing would eliminate me. So I'll fold.\n\nResponse should be JSON: {\"action\": \"fold\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"brief explanation\"}. Let me provide that.",

Better to preserve stack for better spot.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "Wait, I need to understand the situation better. The hand description says Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 0 chips and is \"out\", but then it says \"Seat 2 raise 157\". That seems contradictory. Let me re-read the hand details:\n\n\"Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\" - This suggests Seat 2 is out of the tournament (has 0 chips).\n\nBut then in the actions: \"preflop: Seat 2 raise 157\"\n\nThis is confusing. Perhaps there's a display issue or the player went all-in earlier? Actually, looking at the pot size: 181 chips. That's huge for preflop with blinds 8/16. Let me calculate: SB (8) + BB (16) = 24. But pot is 181. So there must have been a raise already. The actions show: Seat 5 fold, Seat 1 fold, then Seat 2 raise 157. But Seat 2 is listed as having 0 chips.\n\nWait, maybe Seat 2 is actually still in the hand but the stack display is wrong? Or maybe this is a misprint. Let me check the amount to call: 149. My stack is 115. So I can't even call the full amount - I'd be all-in if I call.\n\nActually, I think I understand now. Seat 2 might have gone all-in for their remaining stack of 157 chips (or something like that). The \"0 chips (out)\" might be a display error, or maybe they're all-in.\n\nBut more importantly: I have 2h 5s in the small blind. This is an absolutely terrible hand. I need to call 149 chips with only 115 total. If I call, I'm all-in for my entire stack with 2h 5s against what's likely a strong hand given the raise.\n\nLet me think about pot odds: Pot is 181 chips currently. I need to call 149 (but actually I only have 115, so I'd be all-in for 115). So pot odds are roughly 181:115 or about 1.57:1. I need about 39% equity to call.\n\nWith 2h 5s against a typical raising range, my equity is terrible. Even against a wide range like any two cards above 8, my equity is maybe 30-35%. Against a reasonable range, it's worse.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 115 chips (7.2 BB). That's very short stacked. But going all-in with 2h 5s is terrible. I should wait for a better spot.\n\nPosition: I'm in the small blind. After me is the big blind who has 279 chips. They still have to act. Even if I call, they might raise or call.\n\nGiven how terrible my hand is, I should fold. But wait, let me check if Seat 2 is actually all-in. If they're all-in and I call, it would be heads-up against them. But still, with 2h5s, it's a terrible hand.\n\nActually, looking at the recall_opponent_actions: Seat 2 has been folding a lot recently (hands 53-61 all folds). But earlier they raised in hands 51 and 52. So they might be getting desperate or changing strategy.\n\nBut regardless, 2h5s is one of the worst possible hands. Even with pot odds, it's a fold.\n\nLet me also check my own history: I've been folding a lot too. My win rate is 13%. I'm short stacked. But going all-in with 2h5s is not the way to double up.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

Seat 4 (SB) is MiniMax-M2 with 271 chips, Seat 5 (BB) is GPT-OSS-120B with 242 chips.\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has been folding a lot preflop (7 of last 10 hands folded). Only called once from SB (hand 59) and then bet turn. Seems fairly tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Also folding a lot preflop (9 of last 10 hands folded). Only called once as BB (hand 54). Also seems tight.\n\nMy hand history shows I've been folding a lot too (win rate 12.9%, 8 wins in 62 hands). I have 7.2 BB stack, which is short-stacked. A5s is a decent hand from the button, especially against tight blinds.\n\nWith my stack size, I should be looking to push all-in or raise. A5s has good playability postflop but with only 7.2 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. The pot is 24 chips (8 SB + 16 BB). If I call 16, I'll have 99 chips left (6.2 BB) and will be out of position postflop.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy for short stacks: With 7.2 BB, I should be shoving a wide range from the button against tight blinds. A5s is definitely in that range. The blinds have been folding a lot, so they might fold to a shove.\n\nIf I shove all-in for 115 total (99 more), they need to call 99 into a pot of 139 (24 + 115). They need ~41% equity to call. They might fold marginal hands.\n\nIf they call, A5s has decent equity against many hands. Against a random hand, A5s has ~56% equity. Against a calling range of pairs 22+, A5o+, KQo+, KJs+, it has ~38% equity.\n\nGiven my stack size and position, shoving seems optimal. Calling is bad because I'll be out of position with a weak hand postflop with a short stack.\n\nLet me calculate: If I shove 115, SB needs to call 107 (115 - 8 already posted) into pot of 139, needs 43% equity. BB needs to call 99 into pot of 139, needs 41% equity.\n\nI'll go all-in."

Both players folded to me, so I'm facing just the blinds. Seat 4 (SB) is MiniMax-M2 with 271 chips, Seat 5 (BB) is GPT-OSS-120B with 242 chips.\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has been folding a lot preflop (7 of last 10 hands folded). Only called once from SB (hand 59) and then bet turn. Seems fairly tight.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Also folding a lot preflop (9 of last 10 hands folded). Only called once as BB (hand 54). Also seems tight.\n\nMy hand history shows I've been folding a lot too (win rate 12.9%, 8 wins in 62 hands). I have 7.2 BB stack, which is short-stacked. A5s is a decent hand from the button, especially against tight blinds.\n\nWith my stack size, I should be looking to push all-in or raise. A5s has good playability postflop but with only 7.2 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. The pot is 24 chips (8 SB + 16 BB). If I call 16, I'll have 99 chips left (6.2 BB) and will be out of position postflop.\n\nConsidering tournament strategy for short stacks: With 7.2 BB, I should be shoving a wide range from the button against tight blinds. A5s is definitely in that range. The blinds have been folding a lot, so they might fold to a shove.\n\nIf I shove all-in for 115 total (99 more), they need to call 99 into a pot of 139 (24 + 115). They need ~41% equity to call. They might fold marginal hands.\n\nIf they call, A5s has decent equity against many hands. Against a random hand, A5s has ~56% equity. Against a calling range of pairs 22+, A5o+, KQo+, KJs+, it has ~38% equity.\n\nGiven my stack size and position, shoving seems optimal. Calling is bad because I'll be out of position with a weak hand postflop with a short stack.\n\nLet me calculate: If I shove 115, SB needs to call 107 (115 - 8 already posted) into pot of 139, needs 43% equity. BB needs to call 99 into pot of 139, needs 41% equity.\n\nI'll go all-in.",

This is their first raise in the recent hands I can see. They showed Jc Tc in a showdown at hand #12.\n\n**My Hand Strength:**\n2d 6h is one of the worst possible hands - no connectivity, no suitedness, low cards. This is a clear fold in almost all situations.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI have 7.7 BB, which is very short-stacked. However, 2d6o is just too weak to play from any position, even on the button. With such a short stack, I should be looking for better spots to go all-in or double up.\n\n**Position:**\nBeing on the button is good, but with such a weak hand, position doesn't help much.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nI need to call 32 to win 72, which gives me 2.25:1 pot odds. However, my hand equity against a typical raising range is probably around 25-30% at best, so I'm not getting the right implied odds.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is an easy fold. 2d 6h is unplayable even with good pot odds. I should preserve my stack for a better spot. With 7.7 BB, I can wait for a better hand to go all-in.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"2d6o is unplayable even on button with 7.7 BB.

That's interesting - they're showing some aggression.\n\nMy hand: Th8h suited is a decent speculative hand from the button, especially against just the big blind. It has good implied odds if I hit a flush or straight. With my short stack (7.2 BB), I need to be careful about committing too much.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 into a pot of 24, so I'm getting 3:1 odds. That's good.\n\nPosition: I'm on the button, which is great - I'll have position postflop.\n\nStack preservation: At 7.2 BB, I'm getting short but not critically short yet. I can wait for a better spot, but Th8s on the button against one opponent is a reasonable hand.\n\nOpponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 has been folding a lot but just showed aggression. They might be getting tired of being folded around. If I raise, they might defend with a wide range.\n\nIf I call, I'll have 107 chips left for postflop play (115 - 8). The pot will be 32. If I raise, minimum raise is to 32 total (adding 24 more). That would leave me with 83 chips, which is about half my stack. That's committing a lot with a speculative hand.\n\nGiven my short stack and the good pot odds, I think calling is reasonable. I get to see a flop cheaply with a hand that can make strong draws. If I miss completely, I can fold. If I hit a good draw or pair, I can continue.\n\nActually, wait - I already have 8 chips in from the SB. So I need to call 8 more to make it 16 total. That's correct.\n\nLet me check: I posted SB 8, BB posted 16. Pot is 24. I need to call 8 to match the BB. Yes.\n\nI think calling is the best play here. Raising commits too much of my stack with a speculative hand. Folding is too tight given the good pot odds and position.\n\nLet me also consider that if I call, the BB might check a lot of flops, allowing me to see a free turn or take it down with a bet if I hit something.\n\nI'll call.",

Better",
          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand:**\n- My cards: Th 8h (ten of hearts, eight of hearts)\n- Board: Ks Jh 9c Jd\n- My stack: 107 chips (6.7 BB)\n- Pot: 32 chips\n- Position: BTN (button)\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, BB) with 279 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\nI have Th8h on a board of Ks Jh 9c Jd. This gives me:\n- Open-ended straight draw: I need a Q for a straight (Q-T-9-8-7), but wait, actually looking at the board: Ks Jh 9c Jd. With Th8h, I have 10-8. For a straight, I'd need Q-10-9-8-7 or 10-9-8-7-6. So I need a 7 or Q for a straight. Actually, I have an inside straight draw - I need a Q for Q-J-10-9-8 (using the 9 and J on board) or a 7 for 10-9-8-7-6 (using the 9 on board). So it's an inside straight draw, not open-ended.\n- Flush draw: I have two hearts, but only one heart on board (Jh). So I have a backdoor flush draw.\n- Pair potential: I could hit a ten or eight for a pair.\n- The board has two jacks, so someone could have trips or full house.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the opponent history, MiniMax-M2 seems to fold a lot preflop (13 of 20 actions were folds). In hand #59, they called from BB, checked flop, then bet 8 on turn. In hand #66, they raised to 48 preflop. They seem somewhat passive but capable of betting.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have only 6.7 BB, which is critically short. I need to accumulate chips soon. The pot is 32 chips, about 30% of my stack.\n\n**Current situation:**\nWe're on the turn. Both checked flop. I'm first to act on turn. I have 0 to call, so I can check or raise.\n\n**Possible actions:**\n1. Check: See a free river card. This is safe but gives up potential fold equity.\n2. Bet/raise: I could try to take the pot down now with a bet. With my short stack, I need to accumulate chips. A bet might get a fold from hands like weak kings, weak pairs, or draws.\n\nGiven my short stack and the fact that I have some equity (inside straight draw, backdoor flush, pair outs), I think a bet could be good. If I bet something like 16-24 chips (half to 3/4 pot), I put pressure on opponent. If they fold, I win 32 chips, increasing my stack by 30%. If they call, I still have equity.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful because the board has two jacks, so opponent could have trips. But they checked flop, which suggests they might not have a strong jack.\n\nLet me think about hand ranges. Opponent is BB, they could have a wide range. They checked flop, so likely not a strong hand. They could have a weak king, a jack, a nine, a draw, or air.\n\nMy bet sizing: I have 107 total. If I bet 16 (minimum raise), that's 15% of my stack. If I bet 24 (3/4 pot), that's 22% of my stack. Either is reasonable.\n\nGiven my desperate stack situation, I think betting is better than checking. I need to accumulate chips. Checking gives a free card and I might face a river bet.\n\nI'll go with a bet of 16 chips (half pot). This is enough to put pressure while not committing too much.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 24,\n  \"reasoning\": \"With critically short stack (6.7 BB), need to accumulate chips.

My stack is 107 chips (6.7 BB). Pot is 32 chips. Opponent in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 279 chips. They checked the flop after I checked.\n\nFrom opponent data: They've been folding a lot recently (hands 60-65), but in hand 66 they raised preflop to 48. In hand 59, they bet 8 on turn after checking flop. They seem somewhat tight but capable of aggression.\n\nMy stack is critical - only 6.7 BB. I need to accumulate chips. The board is paired with Js, which reduces the chance opponent has a strong hand. My hand has some equity: gutshot to straight (4 outs) and backdoor flush. If I bet now, I might take down the pot with a semi-bluff.\n\nHowever, I should consider that opponent checked flop, which could indicate weakness. A small bet could work. But I have position (button) and can see river action.\n\nActually, looking at pot size: 32 chips. My stack 107. If I bet 16 (minimum raise), that's committing 15% of my stack. If I get called, I'll have 91 left on river with 64 pot. That's okay.\n\nBut maybe better to check and see a free river? If I check, I get to see river for free. If I hit my draw, I can bet. If I miss, I can check-fold.\n\nGiven my short stack, I need to accumulate chips. A semi-bluff might be good. But opponent has shown some aggression (hand 66 raise, hand 59 turn bet). If they have a J, they'd likely bet flop. Board is Ks Jh 9c Jd - possible they have Kx, 9x, or pocket pair.\n\nI think a small bet is good. Let's bet 24 (3/4 pot). That puts pressure. If called, I still have equity. If raised, I can fold.\n\nWait, legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to: 16. So I can raise to any amount from 16 up to my stack.\n\nI'll bet 24. That's aggressive but not all-in. If opponent calls, pot will be 80, I'll have 83 left. Good.\n\nActually, reconsider: If I bet and get called, I'm pot committed on river. But that's okay if I have equity.\n\nBetter to go all-in? No, that's too much with just a draw. 24 is good.\n\nLet's do it.",

          "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\nI have pocket Kings (Kc Kd) on the button with 139 chips (8.7 BB). This is an excellent starting hand - one of the best in poker. The blinds are 8/16, and two players have already folded. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted the small blind (8 chips), and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) posted the big blind (16 chips).\n\nFrom the opponent data:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has been mostly folding preflop, but raised once to 48 chips in hand #66. They have 271 chips.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has been folding a lot preflop, called once from BB in hand #64, then bet 80 on flop. They have 242 chips.\n\nI'm on the button, which is the best position. With pocket Kings, I definitely want to raise. The minimum raise is to 32 chips, but I should consider a larger raise given my stack size and the strength of my hand.\n\nMy stack is 139 chips (8.7 BB). A standard raise would be 3-4x BB, which would be 48-64 chips. However, given that I'm short-stacked and want to build the pot with a premium hand, I should consider a larger raise or even going all-in.\n\nLet me think about the options:\n1. Call (16 chips): Too passive with KK. I want to build the pot.\n2. Minimum raise to 32 chips: Still a bit small. Might encourage calls from speculative hands.\n3. Raise larger: Better to charge draws and build pot.\n4. All-in (139 chips): With 8.7 BB, this is reasonable. Protects my hand and maximizes fold equity.\n\nConsidering I have only 8.7 BB, going all-in is actually quite reasonable. Pocket Kings is a hand I'm willing to get all-in with preflop. If I get called, I'm likely ahead unless someone has Aces.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that the opponents have been folding a lot. A standard raise might get them to fold, while an all-in might look too strong and get folds too. But with KK, I want action.\n\nActually, looking at stack sizes: If I raise to say 48-64 chips (3-4x BB), that leaves me with 75-91 chips behind, which is 4.7-5.7 BB. That's still a commitment to the hand. If I get called and miss the flop, I'll have to decide whether to continue.\n\nGiven my short stack, I think a larger raise or all-in is best. Let me go with a raise to 80 chips (5x BB). This is a strong raise that should get respect, builds the pot nicely, and leaves me with 59 chips behind (3.7 BB) for post-flop play if needed.\n\nActually, wait - I need to check the raise amount. The minimum raise is to 32 (16 + 16 more). I can raise to any amount up to my stack of 139. 80 chips would be a raise of 64 chips over the BB (16 + 64 = 80).\n\nYes, raise to 80 seems good. It's strong but not necessarily all-in, which might get more calls from worse hands.",

I raised preflop to 80 chips, which was a big raise relative to my stack of 59 chips. Wait, that doesn't make sense - I raised to 80 but my stack is only 59. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nMy stack: 59 chips\nPreflop: I raised to 80? That seems impossible if I only have 59. Maybe the raise amount is the total put in? Let me think: blinds are 8/16. Seat 4 posted SB 8, Seat 5 posted BB 16. Then I raised 80. That would be 80 total, meaning I put in 80 more than the BB? Actually \"raise 80\" likely means I raised to 80 total. Starting from 0, I put in 80. That would be an all-in since I only have 59. But the action says I raised 80, not all-in. Let me re-examine.\n\nActually, looking at the stack sizes: I have 59 chips. The pot is 304 chips. Preflop action: Seat 4 posted SB 8, Seat 5 posted BB 16, then I raised 80. If I raised to 80 total, that means I put in 80 chips. But I only have 59, so I must have gone all-in. The system might show the raise amount as the total. But then Seat 4 called 72 (meaning they had to call 72 more to match my 80, since they already put in 8). Seat 5 called 64 (they had to call 64 more to match my 80, since they already put in 16).\n\nSo I effectively went all-in preflop with 59 chips. But wait, the flop action shows Seat 4 check and Seat 5 bet 64. How can there be a flop if I went all-in preflop? Unless the all-in wasn't called? Actually, both called, so the flop should be dealt with me all-in. But the system is asking me for a flop decision. This is confusing.\n\nLet me check: My stack is 59. I raised to 80 total. That means I put in 80, which is more than my stack. So I'm all-in. But the action continues to flop with me having to act? Maybe the raise was to 80 but I only had 59, so it was effectively all-in, but the system still shows me as having to act on flop because there are side pots? Actually, if I'm all-in for 59, and others called more, there would be a side pot. But I shouldn't have to act on flop if I'm all-in.\n\nWait, maybe I misread: \"Your Stack: 59 chips (3.7 BB)\". That's current stack. But maybe I started with more and the 59 is what's left after preflop? No, the action shows I raised 80 preflop. If I had more than 80 initially, I'd have leftover chips. But it says my stack is 59 now. So maybe I started with 139 chips? 139 - 80 = 59. That makes sense! I started with 139 chips, raised to 80 (put in 80), leaving 59 behind. So I'm not all-in.\n\nYes, that must be it: I have 59 chips remaining after my preflop raise of 80. So total I've put in 80, have 59 left. The pot is 304 chips (8+16+80+72+64 = 240? Let me calculate: SB 8, BB 16, my raise 80, Seat 4 call 72 (80-8), Seat 5 call 64 (80-16). Total: 8+16+80+72+64 = 240. But pot is 304. Hmm, maybe there were antes or something? Or maybe my math is wrong.\n\nActually, 8+16=24. I raise to 80 total, so I add 80. Seat 4 calls, adding 72 more (80-8). Seat 5 calls, adding 64 more (80-16). Total: 24+80+72+64 = 240. But pot is 304. Difference of 64. Maybe there's a mistake or there are antes.\n\nAnyway, on flop: Board Tc 7s 9h. Seat 4 checks. Seat 5 bets 64. I need to call 64. I have 59 chips left.

          "reasoning_content": "Now I need to analyze the situation. I have KK on a Tc 7s 9h board. This is a good flop for my hand - no overcards, only straight draws possible (J8, 86). Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) bet 64 into a 304 pot. I have 59 chips left, so calling would put me all-in.\n\nLooking at Seat 5's history: they've been folding a lot preflop, but in hand 64 they called a small bet (8) then bet 80 on flop. They seem to bet when they hit something. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has been folding a lot, but raised once preflop in hand 66 to 48. They called my preflop raise this hand.\n\nThe bet of 64 into 304 is about 21% of the pot. That's a small bet, which could be a probe bet or a draw. With KK, I'm ahead of most hands: pairs below KK, draws, maybe AT, maybe a set. Sets (TT, 77, 99) are possible but less likely.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 64 to win 304+64 = 368. That's 64/368 = 17.4% equity needed. With KK on this board, I have much more than 17.4% equity against most ranges.\n\nBut I only have 59 chips left. Actually, I need to call 64 but only have 59, so I'd be all-in for my remaining 59. The bet is 64, but I can only call 59. So effective call is 59. Pot would be 304 + 64 (Seat 5's bet) + 59 (my call) = 427. I'm putting in 59 to win 427, needing 59/427 = 13.8% equity.\n\nEven if Seat 4 calls behind (they have 199 chips), the pot gets bigger but my equity requirement stays about the same.\n\nWith KK on this board, I have to go all-in. Folding KK here would be terrible. Even if I'm up against a set, I have outs (two kings, backdoor straight/flush unlikely). But more likely I'm ahead against one pair hands or draws.\n\nTournament considerations: I'm short stacked with 59 chips (3.7 BB). This is a great spot to double up with KK. Even if I lose, I'm almost out anyway.\n\nI should call all-in. My legal actions are fold or call (can't raise). So I'll call.\n\nWait, but Seat 4 is still to act after me. They might raise. But if they raise, I'm already all-in, so it doesn't matter.\n\nDecision: Call all-in with KK on Tc 7s 9h board.",

I need a very strong hand to play from here.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 202 chips (25.2 BB) - This is a decent stack, but still vulnerable. I shouldn't risk chips with weak hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: I should check if there's any relevant history, but from UTG with 45 offsuit, this is an easy fold regardless of opponent tendencies.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 8 chips. The pot is 12 chips, so 12:8 or 1.5:1 odds. Not good enough for this hand.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 25 BB, I need to preserve my stack. Playing 45 offsuit from UTG is chip suicide.\n\nThis is a clear fold. I don't need to check opponent history for this decision - it's a fundamental poker play. 45 offsuit from early position is a fold 100% of the time.\n\nLet me provide the JSON response.",

However, I'm out of position for the rest of the hand if I call. The raise is 3x which is standard.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 20 to win 36, so pot odds are 20:36 or 1:1.8, meaning I need ~35.7% equity. Against a typical raising range from UTG+1 (Seat 2), AJo likely has ~40-45% equity.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 23 BB, opponent has 18 BB. This is not a huge stack difference. If I call and BB folds, pot will be 60 with effective stack of ~140 behind (if BB folds). This creates SPR of ~2.3, which is low - postflop will be pot-committed quickly.\n\nPosition disadvantage is significant from SB. However, I could consider 3-betting given my hand strength and opponent's stack size. A 3-bet to ~60 would put pressure on opponent.\n\nLet me check if opponent has folded to 3-bets before. Let me search for 3-bet situations.",

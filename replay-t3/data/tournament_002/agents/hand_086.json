Even though I'm in position on the button, this hand has very little equity against a typical range. \n\nThe opponent has 98 chips to my 718, so they're quite short-stacked. When someone is short-stacked, their range tends to be stronger because they're likely waiting for premium hands.\n\nGiven:\n1. My weak hand (Ts 5d)\n2.

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My Hand**: Td 2c - This is a terrible hand, one of the worst possible starting hands in poker.\n\n2. **My Position**: SB (small blind) - This is the worst position at the table, acting first post-flop.\n\n3. **My Stack**: 122 chips (7.6 BB) - I'm in the danger zone. This is a short stack but not yet desperate.\n\n4. **Situation**: \n   - Blinds: 8/16\n   - Pot: 56 chips\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) raised to 32\n   - I need to call 24 to see the flop\n   - Minimum raise to 48 (if I were to shove, I'd raise to 122)\n\n5. **Opponent Analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n   - Hand 71: Preflop fold\n   - Hand 72: Preflop raise to 80, then flop bet 120 (very aggressive)\n   - Hand 73: Preflop fold\n   - Hand 75: Preflop fold\n   - Hand 76: Preflop raise to 32, then fold (likely to a re-raise)\n   - Hand 77: Preflop check (limp), then flop fold\n   - Hand 78: Preflop fold\n\n   MiniMax-M2 appears to be playing relatively tight but makes occasional raises. When they do raise preflop, they often follow up with aggression post-flop.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 24 to win 56, which is 42.9% pot odds. This would require me to win at least 42.9% of the time to break even.\n\n7. **Hand Equity**: Td 2c has terrible equity against any reasonable raising range. Even against a random hand, T2o only has about 40% equity. Against a typical raising range, it's likely 30% or less.\n\n8. **Tournament Considerations**: \n   - I'm short-stacked at 7.6 BB\n   - I need to preserve my chips for better spots\n   - T2o from SB is one of the worst possible situations\n   - Even if I hit the flop (unlikely), I'll be out of position\n\n9. **Fold Equity**: If I shove all-in for 122 chips, I might have some fold equity, but MiniMax-M2 has shown they can call or raise preflop and then fold to pressure. However, risking 122 chips with T2o is terrible.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. My hand is terrible, I'm out of position, I'm short-stacked, and the opponent has shown they can be aggressive post-flop which would put me in difficult spots. I should wait for a much better situation to risk my tournament life.",

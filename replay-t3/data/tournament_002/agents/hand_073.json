Not connected, not suited, low cards. This is a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN which is good position, but with only one opponent (BB) left to act.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 146 chips (9.1 BB) is getting short. I need to be selective but also look for spots to accumulate chips.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: The BB seems to be playing tight-aggressive. They fold a lot but when they raise, they raise big. This suggests they're not defending their BB lightly.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, getting 3:1 odds. That's decent odds, but with such a weak hand, it's not enough.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 9.1 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I shouldn't be calling raises with marginal hands. I should either fold or raise (steal).\n\n**Decision**: \n- I could try to steal with a raise since opponent folds a lot\n- However, 8d Js is very weak and if called, I'm in bad shape\n- With my stack size, I should be more selective\n- The opponent has shown they can raise big when they play, so a steal attempt risks a big re-raise\n- Folding is the safest and most correct play here\n\nLet me fold this hand.",

With 2.6 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory\n2. Q5o is not a good hand to shove with, even with only one opponent\n3. However, I get to see a free flop here since SB just completed\n4. If I check and hit something strong, I could potentially double up\n5. If I miss the flop, I can still fold and preserve my 50 chips (after posting BB)\n\nThe opponent seems to be playing somewhat tight but has shown they can call big bets. Given my extreme short stack, I should preserve my chips for a better spot. Checking to see a free flop here is the best option - I risk nothing more and might hit a strong hand to double up with.\n\nI should check and see the flop.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in BB with Qs 5d (offsuit, weak hand)\n- Stack: 82 chips (2.6 BB) - very short stack\n- Board: Kh 7h Tc - King-high with two hearts, possible straight draws\n- Pot: 64 chips\n- Only opponent: MiniMax-M2 in SB with 718 chips\n- It's checked to me, I can check or raise\n\n**My hand:**\nQs 5d is very weak. I have no pair, no draw, just a queen-high. The board is K-high, so my queen is essentially worthless here.\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the opponent actions I retrieved:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been aggressive preflop with multiple raises\n- They called a 187 chip bet in hand #81 (recent)\n- They've shown down strong hands: AA twice, 77, Ac7d\n- They seem to play premium hands strongly\n- On the flop in hand #72, they bet 120 after raising preflop\n- In hand #77, they checked then folded on flop\n\n**Tournament situation:**\nI'm extremely short-stacked with only 2.6 BB. I need to be looking for spots to get my money in with any decent equity or fold equity. However, this is a terrible spot:\n\n1. I have absolutely no hand strength\n2. No draw (no flush draw, no straight draw)\n3. The board is coordinated (K-high with hearts)\n4. I have no fold equity if I bet (opponent has huge stack)\n5. Checking gives me a free chance to see if I improve on turn\n\n**Decision:**\nI should check. There's no value in betting here:\n- I can't get a better hand to fold\n- I have no equity if called\n- I preserve my tiny stack for a better spot\n- I get to see a free card\n\nIf I had any draw or pair, I might consider a check-raise all-in as a semi-bluff, but with Q-high on a K-high board, this is a clear check/fold situation.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"With Q-high on a K-high coordinated board, I have no hand equity and no fold equity against the big stack.

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current State:**\n- I'm in BB with Qs 5d (Queen of spades, 5 of diamonds)\n- My stack: 82 chips (2.6 BB) - very short stacked\n- Board: Kh 7h Tc (King of hearts, 7 of hearts, Ten of clubs)\n- Pot: 96 chips\n- Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 32 on the flop\n- I need to call 32 to continue\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have absolutely nothing - just queen high\n- The board is K-7-10 with two hearts\n- I have no pair, no draw, no flush draw, no straight draw\n- My queen is not even an overcard to the board\n\n**Stack Size Consideration:**\n- I'm extremely short stacked at 2.6 BB\n- This is a tournament situation where I need to find spots to survive\n- However, calling here with Q-high would commit ~39% of my stack (32/82)\n- If I call and miss the turn, I'll have only 50 chips left (1.5 BB)\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data, MiniMax-M2 has been:\n- Folding preflop frequently\n- Raising occasionally (hands 68, 70, 72, 76, 79)\n- Made a big bet on flop in hand 72 (bet 120)\n- In hand 77, checked preflop then folded on flop\n- Called a big bet in hand 81 (187 chips)\n\nThe pattern suggests MiniMax-M2 is somewhat aggressive but also capable of folding. The current bet of 32 into a 96 pot is a small bet (1/3 pot).\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 96\n- To call: 32\n- Pot odds: 128:32 or 4:1\n- I need 20% equity to break even on a call\n\n**My Equity:**\nWith Q-high on a K-7-10 board, I likely have very low equity. Even against a complete bluff, my queen high might not be good. I have no draws.\n\n**Tournament Consideration:**\nAs a short stack, I should be looking for spots to get my money in with decent equity. This is NOT that spot. I have:\n1. No hand strength\n2. No draws\n3. I would be committing 39% of my stack\n4. Even if I call and hit a queen on turn, I might still be behind to Kx, Tx, 7x\n\nThe best play here is to fold and preserve my 50 chips for a better spot where I have actual hand strength or decent equity.\n\nI could consider shoving all-in as a bluff, but:\n- That would be 82 chips to win 128 (pot + opponent's bet)\n- Risking my tournament life on a pure bluff with Q-high\n- Opponent might call with any pair or draw\n- This is too high risk for the situation\n\n**Decision: FOLD**",

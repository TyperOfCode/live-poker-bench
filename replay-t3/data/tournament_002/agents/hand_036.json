            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand:** Qc 7s (Queen of clubs, 7 of spades) - This is a mediocre hand. It's offsuit and not connected. Q7o is generally a fold in most situations.\n\n**Position:** Button (BTN) - This is excellent position, the best at the table. Being on the button means I act last postflop.\n\n**Stack:** 166 chips (41.5 BB) - I have a healthy stack, not short-stacked yet.\n\n**Pot:** 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4)\n\n**Players left:**\n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 222 chips (55.5 BB)\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 198 chips (49.5 BB)\n\n**Opponent tendencies from memory:**\n\nKimi-K2 (Seat 2/SB):\n- Recent pattern shows mostly folding preflop (folded in hands 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35)\n- Has raised preflop a couple times (hand 28: raised to 16, hand 32: raised to 12)\n- In hand 32, raised preflop to 12 but folded on the flop\n- Showdown hand 27 with K9s - seems to play some speculative hands\n- Overall: Relatively tight, folds frequently, but capable of raising\n\nDeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3/BB):\n- Very tight pattern - has folded preflop in hands 28, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35\n- Only showed aggression in hand 29: raised preflop to 16, then bet 25 on flop, checked turn and river\n- Showdown hand 29 with AKs - strong hand\n- Showdown hand 13 with Q3s - questionable hand selection\n- Overall: Very tight, folds most hands, only plays strong hands aggressively\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Q7o is weak. I should fold this most of the time.\n\n\n2. **Positional advantage offers minimal value with such a weak hand. The potential to steal blinds exists, but opponents' tendencies suggest caution. Button position can't compensate for poor card quality.**\n\n3. **Opponent behaviors reveal tight playing styles. Both players frequently fold, indicating potential for strategic aggression. However, their tightness suggests they'll only engage with strong hands.**\n\n4. **Stealing risk assessment shows moderate potential. Small blind and big blind have demonstrated willingness to fold, but could defend unexpectedly.**\n\n5. **Stack preservation becomes crucial. With 41.5 BB, maintaining chip integrity is more valuable than marginal blind-stealing attempts.**\n\n6. **Tournament strategy emphasizes survival and strategic chip accumulation. Risking chips on weak hands contradicts long-term tournament success principles.**\n\n7. **Alternative approach recommends conservative play: fold the hand, observe opponent reactions, and wait for more favorable opportunities.",

            "content": "Looking at this situation, I need to analyze several key factors:\n\n**Position & Hand Strength:**\n- I'm in UTG (Under the Gun) position, the worst position in poker\n- I have Ac 9s - this is Ace-high with a weak kicker, not a premium hand for UTG\n- Being UTG means I have to act first with 4+ opponents still to act behind me\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom my memory of recent hands:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been mostly folding, with occasional raises (12-16 chips)\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Also folds frequently, but when they do play they tend to bet aggressively\n\n**My UTG Performance:**\n- I've played 35 hands from UTG with only a 22.8% win rate\n- Most of my UTG hands have been folded preflop\n- This suggests I should be very selective from this position\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 142 chips (35.5 BB) - a decent stack that I want to preserve\n- No immediate pressure to accumulate chips aggressively\n- Better to wait for a stronger hand from this position\n\n**Decision:**\nAc 9s from UTG is simply too weak to play against a full table. Even though it contains an Ace, the weak kicker and poor position make this a clear fold. I should wait for a premium hand like AA, KK, AK, or at least AQ from this early position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Ac 9s is too weak to play from UTG position against multiple opponents. Need to be very selective from this worst position and wait for premium hands.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand carefully:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have Ac 9s in UTG position\n- Stack is 142 chips (35.5 BB)\n- The blinds are 2/4, so I'm facing a 4-chip call to stay in the hand\n- Minimum raise would be to 8 chips total\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n- I'm in UTG (Under the Gun) position, which is the worst position in poker\n- Being UTG means I act first preflop, so I need a strong hand to play\n- With Ac 9s, I have Ace-high with a decent kicker, but it's not premium\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom my memory:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Recent history shows mostly folds, with occasional raises (16 and 12 chips). Seems tight but can be aggressive when they do play.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Also mostly folds, but when they raise (16 chips), they tend to bet aggressively on the flop. Showed down Ks Ah once.\n\n**My UTG History:**\n- 35 hands played from UTG position\n- Win rate is only 22.8% from UTG\n- Most hands I've played from UTG have been folded\n- I did win one big hand with Tc Ac (Ace-Ten suited)\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 142 chips (35.5 BB), which is a decent stack\n- Not short-stacked yet, but not deep either\n- Need to be selective with hands, especially from UTG\n\n**Hand Strength Assessment:**\n- Ace-9 suited is a decent hand but not premium\n- From UTG, this is probably too weak to play, especially with 4+ opponents left to act\n- Even though it's Ace-high, the kicker is weak and I'm out of position\n- The suited aspect gives me some flush potential, but that's a long shot\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Position: UTG is the worst position\n\n\n2. Hand strength is marginal for early position play\n3. Multiple opponents remain, increasing risk\n4. Low win rate suggests folding is prudent\n5. Preserving chip stack takes precedence over marginal plays\n\n**Recommendation:** Fold the hand to avoid unnecessary risk and maintain chip stack integrity.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to wait for a more commanding position and stronger hand selection from this vulnerable early position.\n",

BB (seat3) posted 4 (big blind). So amount to call is 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise 4 more). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need decide. With K5 offsuit, not a strong hand from UTG. Usually fold. But consider opponent tendencies: seat2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising preflop often (raise amounts 12,32,12,16,12). Those are likely re-raises? Actually they are preflop raises from SB (seat2). In this hand seat2 posted SB 2 (small blind). So they may raise from SB. Their raises are fairly large (12-32) relative to 4 BB blinds? Wait blinds 2/4, so 12 is 3 BB. 32 is 8 BB. So they are aggressive. So likely they will raise when they have decent hands. Our K5 is weak. So we should fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

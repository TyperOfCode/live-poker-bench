With 11.1 big blinds, I need to be very selective about which hands I play. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call with marginal hands.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 24 chips, which is 1.5:1. That's not great odds for a hand this weak.\n\n**Opponents**: \n- Seat 2 (SB): 118 chips (7.4 BB) - also short\n- Seat 3 (BB): 224 chips (14 BB) - medium stack\n\nSince I'm on the Button with a short stack (11.1 BB), I should be thinking about either:\n1. Folding weak hands\n2. Shoving strong hands\n3. Occasionally raising as a steal\n\nWith 7h 4c, this is clearly a fold. It's one of the worst starting hands in poker. Even from the button, I don't want to invest 16 chips (which is about 9% of my stack) with such a weak hand.\n\nI don't need to use any memory tools here - this is a straightforward decision based on hand strength and stack size.\n\nLet me make the fold decision.",

UTG is the worst position to play from, and Td 3d is at the bottom of playable hands. This hand has very little playability unless it hits a very specific flop (like a straight or flush), and even then, I'd be out of position.\n\nFrom the opponent history I can see that Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been active with some raises but has also folded frequently in recent hands. However, this doesn't change the fundamental issue with my hand.\n\nWith 10.8 BB in my stack, I'm in a decent position to survive and wait for better spots. There's already 16 chips to call, and there are still players left to act behind me who could raise further.\n\nTd 3d from UTG is a clear fold in this situation. The hand is too weak to play from the earliest position, especially when facing a call requirement and the uncertainty of players yet to act.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Td 3d is too weak to play from UTG position.

My stack is 173 chips (10.8 BB), so I'm in the medium stack range. The blinds are 8/16, making the pot 24 chips with 16 to call.\n\nLet me think about my hand strength and position:\n1. Td 3d is a very weak hand, especially in UTG position\n2. It's a suited connector but with very low cards (10-3)\n3. UTG is the worst position to play weak hands from\n4. I have decent stack depth at 10.8 BB, which means I can survive without taking risks\n\nLooking at opponent actions from Seat 2 (Kimi-K2):\n- They've been quite active with raises preflop (hand #58 they raised to 24)\n- But they've also folded a lot recently (hands 59, 61, 62, 63, 64)\n- They showed down Kd 9d (lost) and Tc Kc (won)\n- This suggests they play a range but aren't overly aggressive\n\nIn UTG with Td 3d, this is typically a clear fold. The hand is too weak to play from the earliest position, especially when there's already action (small blind posted, big blind posted). \n\nEven though my stack is decent (10.8 BB), playing Td 3d from UTG would put me in difficult spots postflop. I'd be out of position against multiple players, and Td 3d doesn't have much playability unless it hits a very specific flop.\n\nThe correct decision here is to fold. Td 3d from UTG position is too weak to justify calling 16 chips, especially when I'm not getting great pot odds and there are still players left to act behind me.",

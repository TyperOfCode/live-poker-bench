            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My hand**: 8h 3c - This is a very weak hand, unsuited and disconnected. One of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position post-flop, but preflop it doesn't help much with such a weak hand.\n\n**Stack**: 194 chips (97 BB) - Healthy stack, no immediate pressure.\n\n**Pot**: 3 chips (1.5 BB)\n\n**To call**: 2 chips\n\n**Opponent tendencies**:\n- Seat 2 (SB): Very tight, has folded 5 out of 7 preflop actions. Only called once and folded on turn. Seems very conservative.\n- Seat 3 (BB): More active, has called preflop with some regularity and makes bets on later streets. Seems to defend their blind.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 8-3 offsuit is trash. Very low equity against any reasonable range.\n2. **Position**: While button is good, it doesn't compensate for such a weak hand.\n3. **Pot odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3, so 1.5:1 odds. This is terrible for a hand with such low probability of winning.\n4. **Implied odds**: Very low. Even if we hit something like a pair of 8s, we'll often be dominated.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: Early in tournament with healthy stack. No need to take marginal spots.\n\nThe only argument for playing this hand would be if both opponents were extremely tight and I could steal the blinds often. But Seat 3 (BB) defends their blind regularly, so a steal attempt would be risky.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is a clear fold. The hand is too weak, the pot odds are bad, and one opponent defends their blind. No reason to invest chips here.",

The raise is small - only a min-raise from SB. This could be a wide range from SB trying to steal blinds.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 4 chips to win 8 chips in the pot (2 from SB, 2 from BB, plus 4 more from SB's raise). That's 2:1 pot odds, or 33% equity needed.\n\nSet mining implied odds: If I hit a set on the flop (about 11.8% chance), I could potentially win a big pot. With 205 chips effective stacks, if I call 4 now, I'd have 201 left. If I hit a set, I could potentially win opponent's 189 chips.\n\nBut I need to consider opponent tendencies.

The pot is 8 chips (1 SB + 2 BB + 5 raise). I have 205 chips (102.5 BB). Looking at opponent history: Seat 2 has mostly folded preflop (folded 4 out of 5 hands, called once). This is their first raise. They raised from SB after 3 folds, so they could be raising light from the small blind.\n\nPocket 5s is a medium pocket pair. In the BB facing a SB raise, I have good pot odds: need to call 4 to win 8, so 2:1 odds. That's 33% equity needed. Against a typical SB raising range, 55 has about 55-60% equity. So calling is profitable. However, I should consider raising for value or to take initiative. But pocket 5s is vulnerable to overcards on flop. Given opponent's tight history (mostly folding), their raise might be stronger than typical SB range.\n\nBut I have position advantage (BB vs SB) - I'll act last postflop. With 102.5 BB deep, implied odds are good if I hit a set (7.5:1 odds to flop a set, need ~12:1 implied odds). The raise is small (3x BB), so I'm getting good direct odds too.\n\nGiven opponent's tendency to fold preflop, they might be raising with a decent hand but could fold to a 3-bet. However, 55 is not a great 3-bet bluff hand since it has decent showdown value. I think calling is best - see a flop cheaply, try to hit a set, and if I miss, can fold to aggression.\n\nLet me check: legal actions are fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to 10 (total). I could raise to 10-15, but with 55 and opponent's tightness, they might call or 4-bet with better hands. Calling seems optimal.\n\nDecision: Call. Reason: Good pot odds (2:1), pocket pair has decent equity against SB raising range, position advantage, good implied odds if we hit a set, and opponent has shown tight tendencies suggesting their raise may be stronger than typical SB range, making 3-bet risky.",

I have a small pair with no spades. The board has a King high, which likely hits the preflop raiser's range. I have backdoor straight draws (if a 4 comes) and could potentially hit a set on the turn or river. My implied odds if I hit a set could be decent.\n\nPosition: I'm out of position, which is a disadvantage.\n\nStack sizes: I have 201 chips (100.5 BB), opponent has 181 chips. We're both deep.\n\nOpponent tendencies: I don't have specific info yet, but as a default, a preflop raiser continuing on a K-high flop often has at least a King or better.\n\nI should check for opponent history.

However, the system is telling me I'm not responding in the correct format. Let me think about this hand first without the tools.\n\nI'm in the BB with pocket 5s. The board is Ks 7h 3s. I have a small pocket pair that didn't hit a set. The opponent (Seat 2, Kimi-K2) raised preflop from SB and now bets 8 into a 20 pot on the flop. That's a 40% pot bet.\n\nMy hand: Pocket 5s - I have middle pair but it's a weak pair on this board. The board has a K, which is likely to hit a preflop raiser's range. There are also two spades, so there's a flush draw possibility.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 8 to win 28 (20 pot + 8 bet). That's about 3.5:1 odds, or 22% equity needed. My pair of 5s might have some equity against his range, but I'm likely behind to any K, any pair higher than 5s, or overcards with spades.\n\nPosition: I'm out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nStack sizes: I have 201 chips, opponent has 181. The bet is small relative to stacks.\n\nWithout opponent history, I need to make a standard decision. This is a weak hand on this board. I'm likely behind and drawing thin. Folding seems reasonable. Calling might keep me in the hand but I'm out of position and could face more pressure on later streets.\n\nLet me check if there are any draws I could represent. The board has a flush draw, but I don't have spades. I could potentially raise as a bluff, but with my small pair, that's risky.\n\nGiven the pot odds and my weak hand, I think folding is correct.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n1. **My hand**: 7c Jh (J7o) - This is a very weak hand, especially from UTG position\n2. **Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the earliest position, meaning I'm the first to act preflop\n3. **My stack**: 236 chips (118 BB) - I'm in good shape stack-wise\n4. **Current situation**: I need to call 2 chips to stay in, or I can fold or raise to 4 chips minimum\n\nFrom the opponent history, I can see:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 has been calling 2 chips and folding to action\n- GPT-OSS-120B has been checking and calling\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has been calling 3 chips\n- Kimi-K2 has been folding frequently\n\nMy own hand history shows:\n- I won a hand with ATc from UTG by raising to 4\n- I've been folding weak hands like Jd4c and 3h9h\n- I have a 20% win rate so far (1 win out of 5 hands)\n\n**Analysis:**\nJ7o from UTG is a very weak hand. Even though I'm in decent shape with 118 BB, I should be very selective with my UTG raises. J7o has very little equity and is dominated by many hands that players might call with.\n\nThe pot odds are 2:1 (I need to call 2 to win 3), but that's not enough to justify calling with such a weak hand. Even if I call, I'll be out of position and likely facing more bets postflop.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This hand is too weak to play from UTG position, especially when I need to call 2 chips to see a flop. The risk-reward ratio doesn't justify the play, and I should wait for a better spot.\n\nI should fold and wait for a stronger hand.\n",

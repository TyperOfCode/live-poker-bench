In SB with only 7.6 BB left, this is a short stack situation.\n\n2. **Position**: SB (worst position post-flop)\n\n3. **Stack size**: 122 chips (7.6 BB) - very short stacked\n\n4. **Action**: MiniMax-M2 raised to 32 from MP (seat 4). This is a 2x raise over the BB.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 24 to win 56 (24/56 = 43% equity needed)\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: MiniMax-M2 has been raising frequently - 8 raises in various situations. They seem aggressive, raising anywhere from 2x to 6x+ the BB. They raised to 32 in hand #68, to 100 in hand #70, and to 80 in hand #72. This shows they vary their raise sizes.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With only 7.6 BB, I'm in critical territory. I need to make a move soon or I'll be blinded out.\n\n**Analysis of 86s from SB**:\n- This is a marginal hand, especially out of position\n- As a short stack, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold\n- From SB, I need to be very careful as I'll be out of position post-flop\n- The pot odds aren't great (need 43% equity)\n- 86s typically has around 35-40% equity against typical raising ranges\n\n**Decision**: Given my short stack (7.6 BB), being out of position, and having a marginal hand, I should fold. I need to preserve my chips for better spots where I can shove with fold equity. From SB with this stack size, I should only be calling/raising with premium hands or shoving all-in to maximize fold equity.\n\nIf I call 24, I'll have 98 chips left (6.1 BB) and be out of position post-flop with a weak drawing hand. This is not a profitable situation.\n\nI should wait for a better spot - ideally when I'm in better position or have a stronger hand where I can shove all-in preflop.",

            "content": "Based on the additional context from my hand history and opponent behavior, my fold decision is reinforced:\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2):**\n- Has been very active with preflop raises in recent hands (hands 71, 72, 75)\n- Currently has only 16 chips left after raising to 155 - this appears to be a push/all-in situation\n- Short-stacked players often push with marginal hands or go all-in when they have strength\n\n**My Recent Play Pattern:**\n- 24% win rate over 75 hands shows conservative but effective play\n- Successfully folded weak hands like 7h-Ts, 5d-Jh, 3s-2d, 8s-Qc\n- Raised with strong hands (AA twice) and won significant pots\n- My pattern shows good discipline in folding marginal holdings\n\n**Final Assessment:**\nK7s is too weak to call 123 chips (22% of my stack) against a likely all-in push. Even with decent pot odds, the hand has insufficient equity against a range that might include overpairs, better suited connectors, or Ace-high. My conservative approach has been working well, and preserving my 35.2 BB stack is more important than chasing this marginal spot.\n\n**Action: Fold**\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"K7s is too weak to call 123 chips against a likely all-in push from short-stacked opponent.

            "reasoning_content": "Now I have more context from my recent hands and opponent actions:\n\n**From my hand history:**\n- I've been playing fairly conservatively with a 24% win rate over 75 hands\n- I've won some pots with strong hands (AA, AA again) and folded weaker hands appropriately\n- My recent hands show I'm not afraid to fold marginal holdings (7h-Ts, 5d-Jh, 3s-2d, 8s-Qc)\n- I've been raising with strong hands and folding weak ones\n\n**From opponent actions:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been very active with raises in recent hands:\n  - Hand 70: folded preflop\n  - Hand 71: raised 166 preflop  \n  - Hand 72: raised 40, then called 40, then folded on flop\n  - Hand 74: folded preflop\n  - Hand 75: raised 48 preflop\n- So Seat 2 has shown a pattern of aggressive preflop raising\n\n**Current situation analysis:**\n- Seat 2 has only 16 chips left and raised to 155 total\n- This looks like a \"shove\" situation where they're all-in or nearly all-in\n- With only 16 chips left, they're likely desperate or have a strong hand\n- My K7s is too weak to call a significant raise, especially against someone who might be all-in\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I'm at 35.2 BB with 563 chips - good stack size\n- Calling 123 chips would leave me with ~27.5 BB, still manageable\n- But K7s doesn't have enough equity against a likely range of hands\n- The opponent's short stack suggests they might be in \"pushing mode\"\n\n**Final decision:** Fold is still correct. K7s is too weak to call 123 chips, especially when the opponent might be all-in with a better hand. My conservative approach has been working well, and I should stick with it.",

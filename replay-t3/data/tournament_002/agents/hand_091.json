I'm extremely short-stacked with only 3.1 BB\n2. I have a terrible hand (J-2 suited)\n3. I'm on the button which is good position\n4. The big blind is MiniMax-M2 with 718 chips (big stack)\n5. I have to call 16 chips to see the flop\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Frequently folds preflop (hands 73, 75, 78, 80, 83, 86, 90)\n- Sometimes raises (hands 76, 79, 88)\n- Sometimes calls (hands 81, 82, 84, 90)\n- Generally seems to play somewhat tight/standard\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nWith only 3.1 BB, I'm in critical territory. I need to find spots to either:\n1. Shove all-in with a decent hand\n2. Steal blinds when possible\n3. Preserve my stack for a better opportunity\n\n**Hand strength analysis:**\nJ-2 suited is a terrible hand. Even in position, this is not a hand I want to invest chips with. The only redeeming quality is that it's suited, but the ranks are too low.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 48, I need to call 16. That's 3:1 pot odds. But with my stack size and hand strength, this is not relevant - I should either fold or shove, not call.\n\n**Decision:**\nWith 3.1 BB and J-2 suited, this is a clear fold. I need to preserve my tiny stack for a much better spot. Even though I'm on the button and could try to steal, the hand is just too weak. I should wait for at least a decent hand (any pair, any Ace, any two Broadway cards, or at least one high card with connectivity).\n\nThe only argument for playing would be if I think the big blind folds very often, but even then, J-2 is too weak to risk 16% of my stack on a steal attempt when I could find a much better spot.",

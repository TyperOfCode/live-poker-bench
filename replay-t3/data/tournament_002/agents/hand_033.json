A3s from UTG is too weak, especially with a 3 kicker. I could be dominated by so many better Ax hands (AK, AQ, AJ, AT, A9, etc.). The suitedness doesn't make up for the positional disadvantage and kicker problems. I should wait for a better spot.\n\nI should fold.",

The blinds are 2/4, my stack is 202 chips (50.5 BB). Two players have folded, leaving me to act against the small blind (MiniMax-M2, 122 chips) and big blind (GPT-OSS-120B, 262 chips).\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB): Has been fairly active, calling preflop in recent hands (called 8 in hand 32, called 16 in hand 29). Also bet 20 on flop in hand 32. Seems willing to play hands from SB.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB): Has been folding a lot preflop (folded hands 25-32 except hand 30 where they raised to 12). Only one raise in the last 10 hands.\n\nThe pot is 6 chips (SB 2 + BB 4), and I need to call 4 to see the flop. With position (button) and a suited hand, there might be some speculative value, but 73s is extremely weak.\n\nPot odds: 4 to call into 6 pot = 1.5:1 odds, needing about 40% equity. Against typical SB/BB ranges, 73s has maybe 30-35% equity at best. Implied odds could be better since I have position, but with such a weak hand, I'll rarely make strong enough hands to win big pots.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy 50.5 BB stack. No need to take marginal spots with terrible hands. Folding preserves chips for better opportunities.\n\nGiven the weakness of 73s, even with position, I should fold. The small blind might call or raise, and the big blind could check or raise. I'd be out of position postflop with a weak hand.\n\nLet me check my own hand history to see if I've played similar spots.",

It's a low suited connector with poor high card value. \n\nLet me think about tournament considerations: I have 50.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. The small blind has 30.5 BB and the big blind has 65.5 BB. \n\nWith such a weak hand, folding is probably correct. Even with position, 73s has very little value. The only reason to play it would be to steal the blinds, but with two players behind me who haven't acted yet (SB and BB), and such a weak hand, it's not a good steal candidate.\n\nI should check opponent tendencies, but with the basic information I have, folding seems right.

Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\nAnalysis:\n- I have Ace-high which has decent showdown value\n- The board is paired (tens), which means if they have a ten, they have a full house\n- If they don't have a ten, Ace-high could be the best hand\n- My opponent has been very passive - checked on both preflop and flop\n- From the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has checked frequently across multiple streets\n- This suggests they're either weak or very passive\n\nGiven their passive tendencies and the fact that they haven't bet once in this hand, they likely have a weak hand. The paired board makes it less likely they have a strong hand (unless they specifically have tens).\n\nI should bet to take advantage of their passivity. A minimum raise to 4 chips is appropriate - it's small enough to not risk much if called, but enough to potentially win the pot immediately against such a passive opponent.\n\nIf they call, I can evaluate the river. If they raise, I might be in trouble since the paired board could give them a full house.\n",

So now we are in BB with no raise, amount to call 0. So we can check or raise. Hand 5h6d is a suited connector, decent for deep stack but not premium. In early position (BB) but only 65 BB deep, still can play speculative hands. However there is a single opponent in SB with 120 chips (approx 30 BB). Their stack is shorter, but they just called. So they might be playing a wide range. We could consider raising to isolate. With 5-6 suited, we could raise to maybe 12-14 (3x BB). Minimum raise is 8 (to total 8). So raise to 12? The legal raise to any amount? Usually can raise to any amount >= min raise (8) up to stack. Raising could isolate and get heads up pot with good implied odds. However 5-6 suited is not a premium hand; raising might get a 3-bet from them or they may fold. Since they already called, they likely have a range of maybe 70% of hands? In tournament, we may want to steal BB? Actually we are BB, we can check and see flop cheap. With 5-6 suited we have potential for straights and flushes. With 65 BB we can afford to see flop cheap. Checking is safe.\n\nGiven opponent's stack is 120 (shorter) and they just called, they might be looking to see cheap flop. If we raise, we risk being 3-bet and losing more chips. I think best is to check (i.e., not raise). So action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 7,8,9) not immediate. Also we have open-ended? No. We have a gutshot to a straight with a 7 (makes 5-6-7-8-9 but board has no 8 or 9).

No hearts on board. So no flush draw.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) checked flop. They are short stack 120 chips, we have 262. Pot is 8 chips. No bet. So we can check or raise.\n\nWhat is opponent's tendency? Looking at recall: In hand 32, opponent bet 20 on flop after calling preflop. That suggests they may bet when they have something. In hand 24, they called flop bet 20 after preflop call. In hand 29, they called flop bet 25 after preflop call. In hand 27, they checked flop then called later? Actually they called a bet of 16 on flop after checking earlier. So they sometimes check and then call if bet.\n\nWe have weak hand; raising would be a bluff. Our stack 262, opponent 120, pot 8. Minimum raise to 4 (total). So raising to 4 would be a raise of 4? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in, including call. Since amount to call is 0, raise_to 4 means we bet 4 chips. That's a small bet, about 0.5 BB. Could be a probe.\n\nGiven opponent short stack, they might be willing to call a small bet with any pair or decent hand. Our hand is weak; we might want to check and see turn. Also we have decent stack, can fold if they bet later.\n\nThus best action: check.\n\nReasoning: weak hand, no draw, opponent checked, we don't want to risk chips.\n\nSo output JSON.",

Actually board has T,T,2,J. So we have nothing: no pair, no straight, no flush (two clubs? board has T\u2663? Actually Td is diamonds? Wait suits: Td (ten of diamonds), 2s (spade), Tc (ten of clubs), Jh (jack of hearts). So board has two tens, a jack, a 2. Our hand 5h6d gives us a gutshot to a straight? If a 7 appears, we would have 5-6-7-8-9? No. So we have no made hand, just two overcards (5 and 6) which are low. So we are basically drawing nothing. Opponent seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) bet 4 into pot 12 on turn. They are the only opponent left. Their stack 116. So they bet small, maybe they have a hand like a ten, a jack, a straight draw, or a bluff. Our hand is weak. Should we fold? Likely yes. But consider pot odds: pot 12 + opponent bet 4 = 16 total pot after call. Need to call 4 to win 16 => 4/16 = 25% equity needed. Our hand has virtually 0 equity (no outs). So folding is correct.\n\nWe could also raise, but we have nothing, not advisable. So action: fold.\n\nWe must provide JSON.\n\n",

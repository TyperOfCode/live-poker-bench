With 5-7 suited and 11.1 BB, calling 48 chips would leave me with only 130 chips (8.1 BB) in a tough spot on the flop.

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 5d 7d (5-7 suited diamonds)\n2. **Position**: Cutoff (CO), which is decent position\n3. **Stack**: 178 chips (11.1 BB) - I'm in the middle stack range\n4. **Blinds**: 8/16\n5. **Action**: Seat 5 raised to 48 (3x BB)\n6. **Amount to call**: 48\n7. **Pot**: 72 chips (includes SB, BB, and the raise)\n\nLet me calculate pot odds:\n- I need to call 48 to win 72\n- Pot odds = 48:72 = 1:1.5\n- That's about 40% equity needed\n\nMy hand: 5d 7d - This is a suited connector, but it's a weak one. It's not a premium hand, but it has some potential because:\n- Suited (can make flush)\n- Connected (can make straight)\n- Both cards are low\n\nHowever, this is a tournament situation with 11.1 BB. This is actually a short stack situation where I need to be careful.\n\nLooking at Seat 5's tendencies:\nFrom the data I retrieved, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been very tight:\n- Folded preflop in 16 out of 20 recent hands\n- Only raised twice: once for 24 (which could have been a steal) and once for 283 (which was likely a premium hand)\n- When they did raise in hand 57, they continued betting on flop and turn aggressively\n\nThis suggests Seat 5 is a tight player who raises with strong hands. A 3x raise from them likely means they have a premium hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK, etc.).\n\nWith 5-7 suited and 11.1 BB:\n- I don't have the odds to call with this speculative hand\n- If I call 48, I'll have 130 chips left (8.1 BB)\n- If I miss the flop (which is likely), I'll be in a tough spot\n- I could consider shoving as a semi-bluff, but with 11.1 BB, that's a big risk with a weak hand\n \nI need to preserve my tournament stack. With 11.1 BB, I'm in a critical position where I can't afford to waste chips on marginal hands. The tight raiser's range suggests I'm unlikely to win, and calling would significantly reduce my stack without a strong chance of success. Folding is the most prudent move to maintain my tournament life.",

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this hand. I'm in the SB with Js Kd, stack 240 chips (15 BB). The action: I posted SB 8, BB posted 16, then seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 48 total, seat 1 folded, seat 2 raised to 118 total. Wait, seat 2 is listed as \"Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (out)\" but they raised? That seems odd - maybe they're all-in with 0? Actually seat 2 has 0 chips but raised to 118? That must be an error or they're all-in with their remaining stack. Let me check the pot: it's 190 chips. That includes: my SB 8, BB 16, seat 5 raise 48, seat 2 raise 118? Actually seat 2 raised to 118 total, meaning they put in 118 more than the BB? Let me reconstruct: BB is 16, seat 5 raised to 48 (32 more), seat 2 raised to 118 (70 more). So seat 2's raise is to 118 total.\n\nNow I need to call 110 more (total of 118). Minimum raise to 188 (70 more). My stack is 240, so I have 232 left after posting SB.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies: seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been folding a lot recently (last 4 hands folded preflop). They raised in hand 62 to 283. They also bet on turn in hand 57. Not much data.\n\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2) has 0 chips? Actually seat 2 shows 0 chips and is marked \"out\". Maybe they're all-in? If they have 0 chips, their raise might be all-in with whatever they had left.\n\nMy hand: KJo is decent but not premium from SB. Facing a raise and a re-raise. This is likely a fold situation. Pot odds: I need to call 110 to win pot of 190 + my call 110 = 300 total? Actually current pot is 190. If I call, pot becomes 300. So I'm getting 190:110 odds = 1.73:1, need about 36% equity.\n\nKJo vs likely ranges: seat 5 raised, seat 2 re-raised. Seat 2's range is probably strong: QQ+, AK maybe. Seat 5 might have medium pairs, broadways. KJo doesn't do well against these ranges, especially out of position.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 15 BB, which is short but not desperate. Folding leaves me with 232 chips (14.5 BB). That's still playable.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot than to commit half my stack with KJo out of position against a raise and re-raise.\n\nDecision: fold.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have hand #67. We're BB with 7h Ks. Preflop: SB (seat3) posted 8, BB posted 16. Then we (seat5) raised to 48 (i.e., 3bb total). Seat1 folded. Seat2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 118 (so re-raise). Then seats 3 and 4 folded. So we face a 3-bet to 118. Amount to call is 70 (since we already have 48 in, need to put total 118, so 70 more). Minimum raise to 188 (i.e., raise at least to 188 total). Stack 235, we have 235 total chips, but we have already posted 16 blind + 48 raise = 64 in pot? Actually we posted 48 includes blind? Usually raise to 48 means total contribution 48, which includes the 16 blind, so extra 32. So current stack after raise: 235 - 48 = 187 left. To call 70 would leave 117. To raise to 188 total (i.e., add 140 more), would require total contribution 188, we have 48 already, need 140 more, but we only have 187 left, so possible. Minimum raise is 188 total, which is less than stack (188 <= 235). So we could raise.\n\nNow evaluate hand: 7h Ks off-suit. Not a premium hand. In BB vs 3-bet from seat2 (Kimi-K2). Need to know opponent tendencies: recall shows Kimi-K2 often folds preflop, sometimes raises 24 (small). In hand 52, 58 raised 24 preflop. In this hand they raise to 118 (large). Their stack? Unknown but they have 178 chips (they are at 178). So they are short-stacked relative to blinds (8/16). 118 raise is about 7.4 BB (since BB is 16). That's a big raise, maybe a 3-bet or a 2-bet? Actually they are in seat2 (UTG? seat order: seat1,2,3,4,5). Seat2 is after seat1 (maybe UTG). They might be opening raise? Wait: SB posted 8, BB posted 16. Then seat5 (BB) raised to 48. That's a raise (3BB). Then seat2 (Kimi) raised to 118. That is a 3-bet (re-raise). So Kimi is 3-betting. Their pattern: they rarely 3-bet large; they usually raise 24 (maybe 1.5 BB). So this large 3-bet suggests strong hand. Could be AA, KK, AK, maybe QQ, maybe JJ. 7Ks is not strong enough to continue. Also our stack is shallow (14.7 BB). Calling would leave us with 117 chips left (approx 7.3 BB). That's still enough for later. But we risk being dominated.\n\nGiven we have K7 offsuit, not great vs 3-bet. We could consider folding. But maybe we could call as a speculative hand? K7 suited would be okay, but off-suit is weak. Also K7 offsuit has some equity vs AK (maybe 30%). But vs typical 3-bet range (AK, AQ, JJ+, maybe 99-66, AQs, etc), K7 offsuit is very weak.\n\nThus folding is advisable.\n\nCheck if any tournament considerations: stack 235 chips, short. Need to preserve chips. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON with action fold, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

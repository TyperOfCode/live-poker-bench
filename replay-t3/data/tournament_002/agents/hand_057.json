When a tight player raises, they typically have a strong range: high pocket pairs (AA-QQ), AK, AQ, AJ, maybe KQ.\n\n**Hand evaluation:**\nK9o is a marginal hand at best. It's dominated by:\n- All better kings (AK, KQ, KJ, KT)\n- All pocket pairs 99+\n- Even against a hand like AQ, we're only about 45% equity\n\n**Pot odds:**\nI need to call 24 to win 36, which is 24/(24+36) = 40% equity needed to break even.\n\n**Position:**\nI'm in the cutoff which is good position, but there are still players behind me (Seats 2, 3, 4) who could 3-bet or call.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 26.2 BB, which is a decent stack in a tournament. I don't need to take marginal spots like this. Preserving my stack for better opportunities is important.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAgainst a tight player who has been folding almost everything, this raise represents real strength. K9o is too weak to call here. Even with position, I'm likely dominated or flipping at best. I should fold and wait for a better spot.",

The pot is 60 chips (4 SB + 8 BB + 24 raise + 24 call = 60). I need to call 20 chips.\n\nMy stack is 184 chips (23 BB). The button raised to 24 (3x). Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's raising history: they've raised preflop 7 times with varying amounts (8, 12, 8, 8, 24, 16, 48). So they're fairly active, but the 24 raise seems standard. Kimi-K2 tends to call preflop raises fairly often.\n\nWith A4 suited, I have a speculative hand. It's suited with an ace, which gives some potential, but it's a weak ace. In the small blind, facing a button raise and a caller, I'm out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nPot odds: I need to call 20 to win 60, so I'm getting 3:1 pot odds. That's decent. However, I'll be out of position against two players.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 23 BB, which is a decent stack but not huge. Folding loses my 4 chip SB. Calling 20 chips is about 11% of my stack.\n\nThe hand has some implied odds if I hit a flush or straight, but with A4 suited, I'm mostly playing for flush potential or maybe an ace-high flop.\n\nGiven the pot odds and the fact that I have a suited ace, I could consider calling. However, being out of position is a significant disadvantage. Also, the button raiser might be wide, but the caller indicates some strength.\n\nLet me check if I have any history with similar hands.",

The action: UTG (Seat 5) raised to 24 (3x BB), then Seat 2 called. I need to call 20 chips to continue.\n\nMy hand: A4s is a speculative hand. It has some potential with flush possibilities and an ace-high, but it's weak against a raise and a call. I'm out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nPosition: I'm in SB, which is terrible position postflop. I'll have to act first on every street.\n\nStack sizes: I have 184 chips (23 BB), which is decent but not deep. The raiser has 169 chips, caller has 156 chips.\n\nPot odds: Pot is currently 60 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + raise 24 + call 24). I need to call 20 chips. Pot odds: 20/(60+20) = 20/80 = 25%. I need at least 25% equity.\n\nHand equity: Against a typical raising range (maybe 15-20% of hands) and a calling range (probably medium pairs, suited connectors, maybe some Ax hands), A4s probably has around 25-30% equity. It's marginal.\n\nTournament considerations: With 23 BB, I'm not in push/fold territory yet, but getting involved with a weak ace out of position is risky.\n\nI should check opponent tendencies, but the system says I need to respond with JSON.

I need to call 16 more chips.\n\nLooking at the opponent data:\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) is an aggressive preflop raiser who has raised with various hands including Js-Kd, Kc-9s, Jd-Jc, Td-9c. This suggests a wide raising range.\n- The fact that they've raised to 24 (3x the big blind) suggests they might not have a premium hand, as they would typically raise larger with AA/KK/AK.\n\nPot odds calculation:\n- Current pot: 60 chips\n- Amount to call: 16 chips\n- Pot odds: 60/16 = 3.75:1\n\nThis is quite favorable. With Ace-7 suited, I have:\n- Ace-high which can win at showdown\n- Straight potential (A-2-3-4-5, 2-3-4-5-6, 3-4-5-6-7, 4-5-6-7-8, 5-6-7-8-9, 6-7-8-9-T, 7-8-9-T-J)\n- Flush potential with the 7s\n- Two-card combinations that can make pairs\n\nLooking at my SB history, I see I've been playing fairly tight from the SB (folded 39 out of 56 hands, 69.6% fold rate), but when I've played, I've shown some aggression and won decent pots.\n\nGiven the multi-way pot (3 players likely to see the flop), good pot odds, and decent playability of A7s, this seems like a reasonable call. \n\nI'll leverage the favorable pot odds to continue with a speculative hand that offers multiple drawing opportunities. The potential to make a straight or flush, combined with the Ace-high, provides enough equity to justify calling the raise.",

            "content": "Looking at this situation, I need to analyze several key factors:\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe board shows Jh 8d Js - a paired Jack board, which is extremely dangerous. This means there could be sets, two pairs, or opponents with Jacks. Any opponent who stayed in preflop likely has significant strength.\n\n**My Hand:**\nI have 7s Ac - this is a very weak hand. The Ace is my only strength, but it's a weak kicker on this paired board. I have no flush draw (only one spade), no straight potential, and the 7 is essentially worthless.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n- GPT-OSS-120B (the preflop raiser) has been folding most hands, suggesting they only play strong cards\n- Kimi-K2 called the raise, showing decent strength\n- Both players have shown they can be aggressive when they have hands\n\n**Position and Stack:**\nI'm in the Small Blind, the worst position. My 205-chip stack (25.6 BB) gives me room to play future hands, but I shouldn't waste it on this weak holding.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. My Ace-high is barely a bluff-catcher against these opponents on this dangerous board. The paired Jacks mean any reasonable hand has me beat (sets, two pairs, Jacks), and I have no drawing potential to improve.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Fold due to weak hand (A7 offsuit) on dangerous paired Jack board. Any reasonable opponent hand beats me, and I have no drawing potential. Better to preserve my 25.6 BB stack for a better spot.\"\n}\n```",
            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in the Small Blind (Seat 4) with 7s Ac\n- Stack: 205 chips (25.6 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Board: Jh 8d Js (paired Jacks)\n- Pot: 76 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (checking to me)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Preflop Action Summary:**\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) posted SB 4\n- I posted BB 8\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 24\n- Seat 1 folded\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) called 24\n- Seat 3 folded\n- I called 16 (so I invested 8 total, getting 3:1 odds on my call)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n1. **GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5)**: From the recall data, this player has been folding preflop consistently for the last several hands. They raised to 24 preflop, which is a significant raise (3x the blind). This suggests they have a strong hand.\n\n2. **Kimi-K2 (Seat 2)**: From the data, this player has been quite active with various actions - calls, checks, bets, raises. They called the raise preflop, showing some strength but not necessarily premium cards.\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe board is Jh 8d Js - this is a paired Jack board, which is quite dangerous. Possible hands opponents could have:\n- Pocket Jacks (very strong)\n- Jack-X combinations\n- Sets with 8s\n- Flush draws\n- Straight draws\n- Overpairs (QQ, KK, AA)\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\nI have 7s Ac (Ace of spades and 7 of spades). This is a very weak hand:\n- Ace high is decent but not strong on this paired board\n- No flush draw (only one spade)\n- No straight potential\n- Very weak kicker\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Position**: I'm in the Small Blind, which is a terrible position\n\n\n2. **Hand strength**: My hand is extremely weak with minimal potential\n3. **Board texture**: Paired Jacks create a dangerous board with many potential strong hands\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: GPT-OSS-120B's consistent folding suggests a cautious player, while Kimi-K2 has shown more aggressive play\n5. **Pot odds**: With no bet to call, I'm getting a free card\n6. **Stack considerations**: My 205-chip stack keeps me in a comfortable position for future hands\n\nThe board's dangerous nature and my weak hand strongly suggest a cautious approach. With minimal drawing potential and the risk of facing strong opponent hands, folding seems the most prudent strategy.\n",

In a tournament early-ish, with 24 BB, we could raise to 24 (3x big blind) typical. However we are short stack maybe need to be aggressive. Opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 is seat 3, after us? Actually UTG seat5, then seat6? Wait seats: 1-5 are players, seat5 is us. Seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 Kimi-K2, seat3 DeepSeek-V3.2, seat4 MiniMax-M2, seat5 us. So order preflop: after posting SB and BB, action starts with UTG (seat5) first? Actually UTG is seat5, but UTG is after BB? In 5-player table, UTG is first to act preflop (under the gun) meaning left of big blind. So we act first. The amount to call is 8 (big blind). So we can fold, call (8), or raise minimum to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). We have 24 BB, could raise more. Need to decide.\n\nHand Td Jc is decent but not premium. In UTG, raising is standard to isolate. With 24 BB, raising to 24 (3x) is okay. Opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 has raised 6, 16, 20 in past. Those are small raises (maybe 1.5-2.5x). So they may be aggressive but also raise small amounts. MiniMax-M2 unknown.\n\nGiven stack size, we could consider a 3-bet? Actually we are opening, not 3-bet. Should we just call? Not advisable UTG call. Better raise to standard 3x BB = 24. Minimum raise is 16, but we can raise higher. Legal actions allow raise (no limit). So raise to 24.\n\nReasoning: decent hand, need to build pot, isolate, and avoid being called by many players. Also we have decent stack.\n\nThus action: raise to 24.",

Hand 42 they had Kc 8h (pair 8) but board had Ac Kh Ts 9c 3d (flop? not relevant). Hand 43 they had Jd Ad (top pair J) board Qh 2c 8d 3c 6d. Hand 49 they had 6d Ts (pair of tens) board Td Qs Qd Qh 5d (they had pair of tens on board with three queens). Hand 54 they had Ac 7d (ace high). So not huge pattern but they sometimes bet with top pair J, sometimes check. Could be moderate.\n\nGiven our set, we should bet for value. Since they checked, we could bet. How much? Pot 76. A bet of about 50 extracts value from overpairs and draws. Also they may call with Jx (top pair) or 8x, etc. A bet of 40-50 is good.\n\nOur stack 169, we can bet up to that. Minimum raise 16. So we raise to, say, 50. That is total amount we put in: current bet is 0, raise to 50 means we put 50 chips in pot.

Wait board: Jh (Jack hearts), Js (Jack spades), Kh (King hearts). That's two Jacks on board. Our hand: Td (Ten diamonds) and Jc (Jack clubs). So we have three of a kind Jacks (trip Jacks) with a Ten kicker. Actually we have trips Jacks, plus a Ten. The board also has a King, so potential full house? Opponent could have Kx for trips Kings? Actually board has one King, so opponent could have Kx to have pair of Kings with board's King, but board also has two Jacks, so they'd have two pair (Kings and Jacks) if they have a King. They could have a set of Kings if they have K? There's only one King on board, need two more for set. So opponent could have K? Actually they could have K? They have one King on board, they could have another King for pair of Kings (pair), not set. So best they could have is two pair Kings and Jacks, or a straight? Board: J,8,J,K. Ten gives potential straight? 8-9-10-J-Q? No Q missing. So not straight. Could be a flush? Two hearts on board: Jh, Kh, plus 8d. We have Td (diamond) and Jc (club). No flush.\n\nOur hand is strong: trips Jacks. Opponent (Seat 2) called preflop raise, and called flop bet. They have 106 chips, short stack. They are in SB? Actually seat 2 is Kimi-K2 (maybe SB). Their stack is 106 chips (10.6 BB). They called raise preflop 24 (they had 106, posted SB 4? Wait they posted SB 4 earlier? preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 4, seat 4 post_bb 8. So seat 2 is not SB, seat 3 posted SB, seat 4 posted BB. Seat 2 is maybe UTG? But anyway they have 106 left after calling 24, so they have 82 chips left.\n\nNow turn action: amount to call 0, we can check or raise. Minimum raise to 50 (so raise to total 50). Pot currently 176. We have 119 chips total.\n\nConsider opponent's likely hand. They called preflop raise with a wide range maybe. Flop bet 50 into pot 176? Actually flop pot before bet: after preflop, pot: our raise 24 + call 24 + call 16? Wait preflop: we raised to 24, seat2 called 24, seat4 called 16 (since they were BB, they posted 8 then called 16 to match 24). So preflop pot = 24+24+16+4+8? Actually SB posted 4, BB posted 8, then raise to 24, call 24, call 16. So total contributions: SB 4, BB 8+16=24, us 24, seat2 24. So pot = 4+24+24+24 = 76? Wait compute: SB 4, BB (seat4) posted 8 then called 16 = total 24, us 24, seat2 24 => sum = 4+24+24+24 = 76. Yes pot 76 after preflop.\n\nFlop: we bet 50, seat2 called 50, seat4 folded. So pot after flop = 76 + 50 + 50 = 176. Yes.\n\nNow turn: board adds? Actually not given turn card. Wait we are on TURN, but board shown only four cards: Jh 8d Js Kh. That's actually 4 cards, so turn is Kh? Let's see board: Jh 8d Js Kh. That is flop: Jh 8d Js, turn: Kh. So turn is King of hearts. So board now has a King, making potential for opponent to have a King for two pair (K,J). Our trips Jacks remain best unless opponent has a full house (e.g., JJ or KK). Opponent could have a set of Jacks? They would need a Jack in hand, but board already has two Jacks, they could have the third Jack (Jc) but we have that. So they can't have set Jacks. They could have a set of Kings if they have a King? But need two Kings in hand, impossible. So opponent could have a straight? With board J,8,J,K, need 9-10? Not possible. Flush? Two hearts on board"

Wait board: Jh (Jack hearts), Js (Jack spades), Kh (King hearts). That's two Jacks on board. Our hand: Td (Ten diamonds) and Jc (Jack clubs). So we have three of a kind Jacks (trip Jacks) with a Ten kicker. Actually we have trips Jacks, plus a Ten. The board also has a King, so potential full house? Opponent could have Kx for trips Kings? Actually board has one King, so opponent could have Kx to have pair of Kings with board's King, but board also has two Jacks, so they'd have two pair (Kings and Jacks) if they have a King. They could have a set of Kings if they have K? There's only one King on board, need two more for set. So opponent could have K? Actually they could have K? They have one King on board, they could have another King for pair of Kings (pair), not set. So best they could have is two pair Kings and Jacks, or a straight? Board: J,8,J,K. Ten gives potential straight? 8-9-10-J-Q? No Q missing. So not straight. Could be a flush? Two hearts on board: Jh, Kh, plus 8d. We have Td (diamond) and Jc (club). No flush.\n\nOur hand is strong: trips Jacks. Opponent (Seat 2) called preflop raise, and called flop bet. They have 106 chips, short stack. They are in SB? Actually seat 2 is Kimi-K2 (maybe SB). Their stack is 106 chips (10.6 BB). They called raise preflop 24 (they had 106, posted SB 4? Wait they posted SB 4 earlier? preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 4, seat 4 post_bb 8. So seat 2 is not SB, seat 3 posted SB, seat 4 posted BB. Seat 2 is maybe UTG? But anyway they have 106 left after calling 24, so they have 82 chips left.\n\nNow turn action: amount to call 0, we can check or raise. Minimum raise to 50 (so raise to total 50). Pot currently 176. We have 119 chips total.\n\nConsider opponent's likely hand. They called preflop raise with a wide range maybe. Flop bet 50 into pot 176? Actually flop pot before bet: after preflop, pot: our raise 24 + call 24 + call 16? Wait preflop: we raised to 24, seat2 called 24, seat4 called 16 (since they were BB, they posted 8 then called 16 to match 24). So preflop pot = 24+24+16+4+8? Actually SB posted 4, BB posted 8, then raise to 24, call 24, call 16. So total contributions: SB 4, BB 8+16=24, us 24, seat2 24. So pot = 4+24+24+24 = 76? Wait compute: SB 4, BB (seat4) posted 8 then called 16 = total 24, us 24, seat2 24 => sum = 4+24+24+24 = 76. Yes pot 76 after preflop.\n\nFlop: we bet 50, seat2 called 50, seat4 folded.

Potential straight draw: 9-10? If opponent has 9-10, they'd have open-ended straight draw? 8-9-10-J? Need Q for higher. Not strong. But there is a possible gutshot: 10-9-8-J? Actually 9-10 would give 8-9-10-J, missing Q for straight. So not immediate.\n\nWe could check to pot size 176, but we have strong hand. Opponent short stack might go all-in. We could raise to maybe 80-100 to extract value. Minimum raise to 50, we could raise to 100 (total). Our stack 119, can raise to 100, leaving 19 behind. Opponent has 82 chips left, could call all-in. Raising to 100 would be good.\n\nConsider tournament: we have 119 chips, short stack relative to blinds 4/8, but still decent. We want to accumulate chips. So raise.\n\nThus action: raise to 100 (or maybe all-in 119). But minimum raise is 50, we can raise to 119 (all-in). Let's raise to 119 (all-in) to maximize value.

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - best position\n- Cards: Ah 9s (Ace of hearts, 9 of spades) - decent hand, Ace-high\n- Stack: 190 chips (47.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- To call: 2 chips\n- Min raise: 8 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis (Seat 2 - Kimi-K2):**\nLooking at the opponent actions, I can see:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 11, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 23, 24)\n- When they do play, they sometimes raise (hands 12, 21, 22)\n- They made a big raise to 12 in hands 21 and 22\n- In hand 22 they also bet 20 on the flop\n- They seem to be playing somewhat tight-aggressive when they do enter pots\n\n**My Recent History:**\n- I've been playing fairly tight (18 folds out of 24 hands)\n- I've had some success with raises (won with 88 in hand 16, won with 44 in hand 20)\n- Last hand (24) I called preflop with Td Jc and called a flop bet before folding on turn\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: A9o is a decent but not premium hand. It's good enough to play from the button.\n2. **Position**: Button is the best position - I get to act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent**: The BB seems to fold a lot preflop, so there's fold equity.\n4. **Pot Odds**: Calling 2 to win 6 = 3:1 pot odds, which is good for A9.\n5. **Stack Size**: I have a healthy 47.5 BB, can afford to play this hand.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight from the button with A9o. This would be overly cautious.\n- **Call**: Reasonable. I see a flop in position with a decent hand. Risk is small (2 chips).\n- **Raise**: Also reasonable. I have fold equity against a tight opponent, and I can take control of the hand. Min raise is 8 chips.\n\nGiven that I'm on the button, have a tight image, and the opponent folds a lot preflop, I think a raise is the best play. It gives me fold equity, and if called, I have position and a hand that can hit strong top pairs.\n\nA standard raise would be 3x the big blind = 12 chips, but the minimum is 8. I should raise to at least 12 to make it a real raise. Given my stack and the opponent's tendency to fold, I could even go to 14-16.\n\nLet me raise to 12 chips (3x BB), which is a standard size and puts pressure on the tight BB.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: Ah 9s - Ace-nine offsuit. This is a decent but not great hand, especially in position.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position postflop.\n\n3. **Stack**: I have 180 chips (45 BB), which is a healthy stack.\n\n4. **Action**: \n   - I raised to 12 from the button (3x BB standard raise)\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) re-raised to 32 (a 3-bet)\n\n5. **Amount to call**: 20 chips (I already invested 12, need to add 20 more to call 32 total)\n\n6. **Pot odds**: There's 44 in the pot + my 12 + their 32 = 88 chips. I need to call 20, so getting 88:20 or about 4.4:1 odds.\n\n7. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at the recall data for Seat 2:\n   - They've been relatively tight, folding preflop many times\n   - They've made some raises (hands 12, 21, 22) \n   - In hand 22, they raised preflop to 12 and then bet 20 on the flop, showing aggression\n   - They seem to play straightforwardly - when they raise, they likely have a strong hand\n   - No showdown data available\n\n8. **Hand strength**: A9o is marginal against a 3-bet. Against a typical 3-betting range (JJ+, AQ+, maybe some bluffs), A9o is in bad shape. Even if they're 3-betting lighter, I'm dominated by many hands (AT+, AJ+, AQ+, AK).\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: With 45 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I can wait for better opportunities. Calling here would put 32 chips in the pot (18% of my stack) with a marginal hand out of position for my opponent postflop (they'll be acting first).\n\n10. **Decision**: This is a clear fold. A9o is too weak to call a 3-bet, even with position. The opponent's raise to 32 suggests strength, and I don't have the pot odds or implied odds to justify calling with this hand. I should preserve my chips for better spots.",

This is one of the worst starting hands in poker, especially from the earliest position. Even though the pot odds seem reasonable (6:4), the hand has very little equity and potential.\n\nI should wait for a much stronger hand before committing chips from this early position. Folding here preserves my stack for better opportunities.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Q4 offsuit from UTG is one of the weakest hands in poker.

Seems somewhat aggressive when they do play.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): More aggressive - made raises in hands 21 and 22, and bet big on the flop in hand 22. Has shown willingness to be aggressive.\n\n**My Recent History:**\n- I've been folding a lot (18 folds out of 24 hands, 75% fold rate)\n- My last hand (24) was a call from BTN with T9, and I ended up calling down through the river but lost\n- I haven't won many hands recently (4 wins out of 24 hands, 16.7% win rate)\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I have Q4o from UTG - this is still a very weak hand\n- Both opponents behind me have shown some aggression\n- The pot odds are 6:4 (1.5:1) which isn't terrible, but this hand has very little equity\n- I'm getting good information about opponents, but it doesn't change the fundamental weakness of Q4o\n\nThe hand strength is still the primary factor here. Q4o from UTG is one of the worst hands in poker. Even with the pot odds and opponent information, this is still a clear fold.

            "reasoning_content": "  We need to decide on an action for Hand #1 - Preflop. We are Seat 1 (BTN) with Ah Qc. We have 200 chips (100 BB). Blinds are 1/2. Pot is 11 chips. Actions: Seat 2 posted SB 1, Seat 3 posted BB 2, Seat 4 raised to 4, Seat 5 called 4. So we are facing a raise of 4 (which is a min-raise? Actually seat 4 raised to 4, which is a raise of 2 over the BB of 2? Wait blinds are 1/2, so SB is 1, BB is 2. Seat 4 raised to 4, which is a raise of 2 (i.e., a min-raise). Seat 5 called. So we are on the BTN, facing a raise to 4. We have Ah Qc. We need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise.\n\nWe have a strong hand: AQ offsuit is a premium hand, especially on the BTN. The raise is small (to 4). The pot is 11 chips. We have 200 chips. We can call, raise, or fold. We need to consider opponent tendencies. We can use tools to recall opponent actions.\n\nWe have tools: recall_my_hands, search_opponent_actions, recall_opponent_actions. We need to search for opponent actions. We need to recall opponent actions for specific opponents. The opponents are Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) and Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B). Seat 2 and Seat 3 are SB and BB respectively. But we need to recall opponent actions for these opponents.\n\nWe need to decide on an action. Let's think.\n\nWe have Ah Qc. This is a strong hand. The raise is small. The BTN is a good position. We can call or raise. We can also fold, but that would be too tight. We need to consider opponent tendencies. Let's search for opponent actions.\n\nWe can use search_opponent_actions with query \"MiniMax-M2\" or \"GPT-OSS-120B\". But we need to know what they have done in past hands. However we have no memory of past hands. This is Hand #1. So there is no prior history. So we cannot recall any opponent actions. So we need to rely on default assumptions.\n\nThus we should treat this as a standard scenario: BTN vs a small raise from MP (Seat 4) and a call from CO (Seat 5). The raise is small, indicating possibly a weak hand or a trapping hand. But we have no reads. So we should treat this as a standard situation: BTN with AQ offsuit facing a small raise and a call. We should raise for value and to isolate. We can raise to something like 12-16 chips. The minimum raise to is 6 (i.e., we can raise to at least 6). But we can raise larger. We have 200 chips. We can raise to 12 or 14. Let's decide.\n\nWe need to consider the pot: currently 11 chips (SB 1, BB 2, raise 4, call 4). If we raise to 12, that is a raise of 8 over the current bet of 4. So we would be putting 12 chips. That would be a decent size. If we raise to 14, that is a raise of 10. We can also raise to 16. But we need to consider that we are out of position relative to the blinds? Actually we are on the BTN, which is the best position. So we can raise to isolate and get value from weaker hands.\n\nThus we should raise. Let's raise to 12. That is a standard 3x the raise size (the raise was 4, so 3x would be 12). Or we could raise to 14. But 12 is fine.\n\nWe need to provide reasoning: we have a premium hand AQ, we are on the BTN, we want to isolate and build pot, we have position.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to: 12, reasoning: \"BTN with AQ offsuit is a premium hand; facing a small raise and a call, we want to isolate and build pot; we have position.\"\n\nThus we output JSON.\n\nBut we need to ensure we follow the exact format: {\"action\": \"raise\", \"raise_to\": 12, \"reasoning\": \"...\"}.\n\nWe need to ensure we include \"raise_to\" only if raising. Yes.\n\nThus final answer.\n\nBut before final, let's double-check the rules: \"If raising, 'raise_to' is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\". So if we raise to 12, that is the total amount we put in. That is correct.\n\nWe need to ensure we do not exceed our",

This board could hit:\n- Pocket pairs (sets with 55, 66, 22)\n- Straight draws (34, 47, 78)\n- Two pairs (65, 52, 62)\n\n**My Position:**\nI'm in position (on the button) which is great. Both opponents have shown weakness by checking.\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\n- Me: 188 chips\n- Seat 4: 188 chips\n- Seat 5: 188 chips\n\n**Decision Point:**\nI can check or bet. Let me think about what to do:\n\n1. **Check**: This gives me a free card to try to hit my Ace or Queen. It keeps the pot small. If I miss the turn, I can evaluate based on their action.\n\n\n2. **Bet**: This is a good spot for a continuation bet. I showed strength preflop with a 3-bet, and this board is relatively dry. My opponents' checks suggest weakness, making a bet potentially profitable. A half-pot bet of around 20 chips could pressure them to fold marginal hands. \n\nI'll analyze my opponents' likely holdings. Seat 4's initial raise suggests a strong range, possibly pocket pairs 77+ or strong broadway hands. Seat 5's flat call indicates a slightly wider but still cautious range.

This board could hit:\n- Pocket pairs (sets with 55, 66, 22)\n- Straight draws (34, 47, 78)\n- Two pairs (65, 52, 62)\n\n**My Position:**\nI'm in position (on the button) which is great. Both opponents have shown weakness by checking.\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\n- Me: 188 chips\n- Seat 4: 188 chips\n- Seat 5: 188 chips\n\n**Decision Point:**\nI can check or bet. Let me think about what to do:\n\n1. **Check**: This gives me a free card to try to hit my Ace or Queen. It keeps the pot small. If I miss the turn, I can evaluate based on their action.\n\n\n2. **Bet**: This is a good spot for a continuation bet. I showed strength preflop with a 3-bet, and this board is relatively dry. My opponents' checks suggest weakness, making a bet potentially profitable. A half-pot bet of around 20 chips could pressure them to fold marginal hands. \n\nI'll analyze my opponents' likely holdings. Seat 4's initial raise suggests a strong range, possibly pocket pairs 77+ or strong broadway hands. Seat 5's flat call indicates a slightly wider but still cautious range.

            "content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: Ah Qc\n- Stack: 168 chips (84 BB)\n- Board: 5c 6d 2s 7d\n- Pot: 119 chips\n- Current action: Seat 4 bet 20, Seat 5 folded\n- I need to call 20 to continue\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have Ah Qc - Ace high\n- Board: 5c 6d 2s 7d\n- No pair, no draw really. Just Ace high\n- However, this is a very coordinated board with straight possibilities (3-4, 3-7, 4-8, etc.)\n- There's also a potential flush draw with three clubs on board (5c, 2s, 7d - wait, only 5c is a club, 2s is spade, 7d is diamond. Let me recount: 5c, 6d, 2s, 7d - actually only one club. So no flush draw yet.\n\n**Action history:**\n- Preflop: Seat 4 raised to 4, Seat 5 called, I 3-bet to 12, both called\n- Flop: I bet 20, both called\n- Turn: Seat 4 leads out for 20, Seat 5 folds\n\nThis is interesting. Seat 4 called my 3-bet preflop, called my flop bet, and now is leading the turn. Seat 5 was in between but folded.\n\nLet me think about what Seat 4 might have:\n- They raised preflop from early position (seat 4 is MP)\n- Called a 3-bet\n- Called a flop bet\n- Now betting the turn\n\nThe board is 5-6-2-7. This hits a lot of hands that would raise preflop:\n- Pairs: 77, 66, 55, 22 would all be strong\n- Straight draws: 34, 48, 89 for open-ended\n- Overpairs: 88-TT might play this way\n- Two pairs: 75, 76, 65, etc.\n\n\n- I need to consider my tournament position carefully\n- My chip stack is relatively healthy at 84 BB\n- The pot is getting substantial at 119 chips\n- Calling risks 20 chips, which is about 12% of my stack\n- The potential loss could impact my tournament standing\n\nI'm realizing my initial flush draw assessment was incorrect. The board actually shows limited flush potential. This means my Ace-high hand is even weaker than I first thought. The turn bet from Seat 4 suggests they have a made hand or strong draw. With my current holding, folding seems the most prudent move to protect my chip stack and tournament position. I need to consider the betting patterns and potential opponent strategies. The small turn bet suggests either a defensive move with a vulnerable hand or a strategic probe bet. My preflop 3-betting range appears strong, and my flop bet indicates confidence. \n\nOpponents' actions reveal interesting dynamics: Seat 4's consistent calls and turn bet hint at a moderately strong hand, while Seat 5's fold suggests weakness. The pot odds of nearly 7:1 make calling tempting, but the risk of facing a larger river bet is significant.\n\nI'm analyzing potential hand ranges, recognizing that many would have shown more aggression earlier if they were truly premium hands. The turn bet sizing feels like a potential blocker or defensive maneuver, trying to control the pot's progression.\n\nMy stack size of 168 chips provides some flexibility, but I must weigh the potential river scenarios carefully.

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: Ah Qc\n- Stack: 168 chips (84 BB)\n- Board: 5c 6d 2s 7d\n- Pot: 119 chips\n- Current action: Seat 4 bet 20, Seat 5 folded\n- I need to call 20 to continue\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have Ah Qc - Ace high\n- Board: 5c 6d 2s 7d\n- No pair, no draw really. Just Ace high\n- However, this is a very coordinated board with straight possibilities (3-4, 3-7, 4-8, etc.)\n- There's also a potential flush draw with three clubs on board (5c, 2s, 7d - wait, only 5c is a club, 2s is spade, 7d is diamond. Let me recount: 5c, 6d, 2s, 7d - actually only one club. So no flush draw yet.\n\n**Action history:**\n- Preflop: Seat 4 raised to 4, Seat 5 called, I 3-bet to 12, both called\n- Flop: I bet 20, both called\n- Turn: Seat 4 leads out for 20, Seat 5 folds\n\nThis is interesting. Seat 4 called my 3-bet preflop, called my flop bet, and now is leading the turn. Seat 5 was in between but folded.\n\nLet me think about what Seat 4 might have:\n- They raised preflop from early position (seat 4 is MP)\n- Called a 3-bet\n- Called a flop bet\n- Now betting the turn\n\nThe board is 5-6-2-7. This hits a lot of hands that would raise preflop:\n- Pairs: 77, 66, 55, 22 would all be strong\n- Straight draws: 34, 48, 89 for open-ended\n- Overpairs: 88-TT might play this way\n- Two pairs: 75, 76, 65, etc.\n\n\n- I need to consider my tournament position carefully\n- My chip stack is relatively healthy at 84 BB\n- The pot is getting substantial at 119 chips\n- Calling risks 20 chips, which is about 12% of my stack\n- The potential loss could impact my tournament standing\n\nI'm realizing my initial flush draw assessment was incorrect. The board actually shows limited flush potential. This means my Ace-high hand is even weaker than I first thought. The turn bet from Seat 4 suggests they have a made hand or strong draw. With my current holding, folding seems the most prudent move to protect my chip stack and tournament position. I need to consider the betting patterns and potential opponent strategies. The small turn bet suggests either a defensive move with a vulnerable hand or a strategic probe bet. My preflop 3-betting range appears strong, and my flop bet indicates confidence. \n\nOpponents' actions reveal interesting dynamics: Seat 4's consistent calls and turn bet hint at a moderately strong hand, while Seat 5's fold suggests weakness. The pot odds of nearly 7:1 make calling tempting, but the risk of facing a larger river bet is significant.\n\nI'm analyzing potential hand ranges, recognizing that many would have shown more aggression earlier if they were truly premium hands. The turn bet sizing feels like a potential blocker or defensive maneuver, trying to control the pot's progression.\n\nMy stack size of 168 chips provides some flexibility, but I must weigh the potential river scenarios carefully.

This gives me Ace high with backdoor flush draw (2 clubs) and some straight potential\n3. Position: I'm in the SB, so I'm out of position\n4. The bet: 20 chips into 59 chip pot (about 34% of pot)\n5. Stack sizes: I have 188 chips, so this is a meaningful bet but not devastating\n6. Pot odds: I'm getting about 3:1 to call (59+20+20 = 99 pot, need to call 20)\n\nThe board is very dry (5-6-2 rainbow), so there aren't many draws available. The only real draws would be:\n- Backdoor flush draws (like mine)\n- Backdoor straight draws (like 3-4 or 4-7)\n\nGiven that this is a small bet on a dry board, and I have Ace high which has decent showdown value, plus I have backdoor equity, I think calling is reasonable. \n\nHowever, I should consider that I'm out of position, which makes playing drawing hands more difficult. But the pot odds are good and I have showdown value.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The bet is 20 into 59, which means the pot will be 99 if I call. I'll have 168 chips left if I call. This is still a meaningful portion of my stack.\n\nGiven that I'm out of position and this is a tournament where chip preservation is important, and considering that Ace high has decent showdown value on this board, I think calling is the right play here.",

Let me analyze the hand situation:\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I have AcTc (Ace-Ten suited) - this is a very strong hand\n- Board: 5c-6d-2s-7d - this gives me Ace-high, but also potential for:\n  - Straight potential (I have T and A, board has 5-6-7, so I could make a straight if 8 or 9 comes)\n  - Flush potential (I have two clubs, board has one club, so I could make a flush)\n  - Two pair potential (A-T with this board)\n\nThe action:\n- Seat 1 bet 20 on the flop\n- I called 20\n- Seat 5 called 20\n- Now we're on the turn and it's my action\n\nWith a pot of 99 chips and my strong hand (AcTc), I have several options:\n1. Check (since amount to call is 0, this means I'm checking)\n2. Raise (minimum raise to 20)\n\nGiven that I have a very strong hand with Ace-high and drawing potential, and considering that:\n- I was the preflop raiser\n- I called the flop bet\n- I have position on Seat 1 but not Seat 5\n- The board is somewhat coordinated (5-6-7) which could give opponents strong hands\n\nI think the best play here is to check and see what Seat 1 does. If they check behind, I might get to see a cheap river. If they bet, I can call or raise depending on the size. If they check, I can also consider betting on the river.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With Ace-Ten suited on this board, I have a very strong hand. The board is 5c-6d-2s-7d - I have top pair with Ace, and I have straight and flush draws. \n\nConsidering the pot size and the strength of my hand, I'm leaning towards taking a more aggressive stance. My Ace-Ten suited gives me multiple ways to win - top pair, straight potential, and flush potential. The coordinated board suggests there might be opportunities to extract more value from opponents holding drawing hands or weaker pairs.\n",

So pot after call: 79 + 20*2 = 119? Actually pot before flop: 79. Then bet 20 (seat1) + call 20 (seat4) = 40 added, so pot 119. We face bet 20, we can call, raise to at least 40 total (i.e., raise by 20). Need to consider hand strength: Kc Qh is overcards, but board is low, no straight draws yet (5-6-2). Potential draws: 4-3 gives straight, also 7-8? Actually 5-6 need 4-3 or 7-8. Our hand KQ doesn't help. Opponent likely has range: preflop they raised from seat1 after 4-raise from seat4 and our call. Preflop action: Seat4 raised 4 (open raise), we called, seat1 (Kimi) re-raised to 12 (3-bet). Then seat4 and us called. So seat1's 3-bet range likely strong: maybe broadway combos, AK, AQ, AA, KK, maybe suited connectors. Postflop, they bet 20 into pot 79 (about 25% pot) on a low board. Could be continuation bet with many hands. Our KQ has showdown value if opponent has pair lower than K, but we have no pair yet. Potential to improve on turn/river. But calling 20 adds 20 to pot of 119, odds ~20/139 = 14.4% needed. Our equity? With KQ vs unknown range maybe 30%? Might be okay to call. But also consider stack sizes: we have 188, opponent 168, seat4 168. All relatively shallow. Could consider raising to protect? But we have no made hand, raising may be too aggressive.\n\nOpponent seat1 may be aggressive; we could call to see turn.\n\nCheck legal actions: fold, call, raise. I think call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

So after flop 5c6d2s, turn 7d. MiniMax-M2 bet 20 on turn. We have Kc Qh, currently we have gutshot straight draw? Board: 5-6-2-7, we have KQ, so we have open-ended straight draw? Actually need 4-8 for straight. 4 would give 2-3-4-5-6? No we have 5-6-2-7, need 4 or 8 to make straight: 4-5-6-7-8? Wait 4-5-6-7-8 requires 4 and 8, we only have one card. So we have gutshot? Let's enumerate: possible straights: 3-4-5-6-7 (needs 3 or 4). 4-5-6-7-8 (needs 4 or 8). So we have two outs each? Actually we have KQ, no straight. So we have two gutshot outs (4,3,8). Actually 3 also works for 3-4-5-6-7? need 3 and 4, we have none. So need either 3 and 4? Wait need 5 cards. With board 5,6,2,7 we need 3,4,8,9,10,J,A? Let's check combos: Straight possibilities that include board cards: 2-3-4-5-6 (needs 3 and 4). 3-4-5-6-7 (needs 3 and 4). 4-5-6-7-8 (needs 4 and 8). 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 8 and 9). So we need two cards, not one. So we have no straight draw. We have two overcards KQ, maybe pair? No pair on board. So we have high cards but no made hand. So likely fold to turn bet of 20. Pot is 119, bet 20 makes pot 139, call 20 gives us 159 pot, odds ~12.6% needed, we have no equity. So fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies? MiniMax-M2 maybe aggressive? But not needed.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

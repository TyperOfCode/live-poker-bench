Effective stack: opponent 82 chips, we have 287. Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise to 40 total). Need to decide.\n\nK8 suited is a marginal hand in BB vs short stack raise. Consider opponent's raise size: 24 into 8/4 blinds (3bb). That's a standard open raise from early position? Actually seat 2 is likely UTG? Not sure. But they have 82 chips (10.25 BB). Short stack, likely to shove soon. Raising 24 (3bb) is small; maybe they are trying to steal? Could be a wide range. K8 suited is decent but not premium. Against a short stack, calling may be okay for set mining? Not good.\n\nStack sizes: if we call 16 more (to 24 total), we will be at 271 chips left, opponent at 66 chips (if they call). Pot after call: 36 + 16 = 52 chips. Opponent's effective stack 66 vs us 271. We would be out of position post-flop (they are in UTG, we are BB). K8 suited has some potential for straight/flush draws.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should consider re-raising (3-bet) to isolate. But K8 suited is not strong enough to 3-bet for value; could be a bluff, but short stack may call or shove. Minimum raise to 40, which is 5bb total. That's still relatively small. If we 3-bet to 40, opponent might just call and then go all-in later? Their stack 82, they could shove all-in for 58 more (to 82). That would be a huge risk for us with K8.\n\nBetter perhaps to fold. Evaluate equity: K8s vs unknown range of short stack raise (maybe 20% of hands). K8s equity maybe ~35% vs that range. But calling 16 for pot 36 (pot odds ~ 16/(36+16)=16/52=30.8%). So pot odds are okay. However post-flop disadvantage, and implied odds limited because opponent short stack.\n\nThus folding is likely best.\n\nLet's produce JSON.",

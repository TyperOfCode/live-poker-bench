A medium pocket pair.\n2. **Position**: SB (worst position post-flop)\n3. **Stack**: 166 chips (41.5 BB) - Healthy stack\n4. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 8 from the CO position\n5. **Pot**: 14 chips, need to call 6 more\n\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n- Very tight preflop: folded 7 out of 10 recent hands\n- Only raised once before (hand #30) when they raised to 12\n- They seem to be playing very conservatively\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Pocket sevens is a decent hand but vulnerable to overcards\n- We're out of position which is a big disadvantage\n- The raise is small (8 into a pot of 6) - only 2x the BB\n- We have a healthy stack and could call to see a flop\n- However, we're in SB and will be first to act post-flop\n\n**Pot odds**: Need to call 6 to win 14, getting ~2.3:1. Not great for a pair that needs to hit a set to be confident.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 41.5 BB, we have room to play. Set mining is possible, but we need good implied odds.\n\n**Opponent read**: GPT-OSS-120B seems tight, so their raise range is probably strong. They might have higher pairs or big cards that dominate us.\n\nGiven our position and the opponent's tight image, I think this is a fold. We're out of position with a medium pair against what appears to be a tight player. The pot odds aren't great for set mining (we'd need ~10:1 implied odds typically), and being first to act post-flop multiplies our disadvantage.",

Any decent hand will likely get raised by players behind me, making this an expensive proposition.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom memory, I can see that:\n- Seat 1 has been folding frequently but showed some aggression in recent hands\n- Seat 2 has been more active with raises, suggesting a wider range\n\n**Tournament Strategy:**\nAt 35.5 BB stack, I need to be selective and preserve chips for better spots. K3o is far too weak to play from UTG, especially when there are still 3+ players left to act who could easily have better hands.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. K3o from UTG has very little equity and terrible playability. I should wait for a better hand and better position.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Kc 3d is too weak to play from UTG position.

I have to act first preflop with no information about anyone else's intentions. This significantly limits the hands I can profitably play.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nKc 3d is a very weak hand. While it has a King, the kicker is terrible (3). This is essentially a weak King with a bad kicker. In early position, this hand has very little equity against a reasonable range.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the memory data:\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has been folding a lot recently (most recent actions are folds), but did raise to 12 in hands 25, 26. In the last hand, they checked and then bet 8 on the flop, suggesting they might be in a calling station or loose passive player.\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been more active with raises (12, 32, 16, 12 chips), suggesting they have a wider raising range. They showed Kd 9d in hand 27 and won.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm at 35.5 BB, which is a healthy stack\n- Need to preserve chips rather than spew them\n- UTG with K3o is generally a fold in most situations\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. K3o (King-3 offsuit) is too weak to play from UTG, especially when:\n1. I'm in the worst position\n2. The hand has very little equity \n3. I have a terrible kicker\n4. There are still several players left to act who might have better hands\n\n\n5. Folding allows me to conserve my chips for a more promising opportunity with better positioning and hand strength.\n",

In BTN, can we steal? The SB has 2 chips, which is only 0.5 BB, basically a dead short stack. The BB has 4 chips, 1 BB. Both are extremely short; they likely will be forced to fold any raise that exceeds their stack. If we raise, we can potentially pick up the blinds. However, we must consider that they could shove all-in (since they have short stacks). Minimum raise is 8 (i.e., to 8 total). That would be 4 more than the BB. The SB would have to call 8 (but they only have 2, they'd be all-in for 2). Actually they could go all-in for 2. The BB could also go all-in for 4. So raising to 8 would be a steal, likely they fold (or call all-in for 2/4). But we need to consider tournament: we have a huge stack; we can risk a raise with a weak hand to pick up blinds.\n\nGiven we have 5d Qh, not great but decent for steal. The SB is a short stack; they might be forced to shove if they have any decent hand. But they have only 2 chips, can't raise beyond that. So we can raise to 8, they can call all-in for 2, we would win extra 2 chips if they call. That's fine.\n\nThus best action: raise to 8 (minimum raise) to attempt to steal.

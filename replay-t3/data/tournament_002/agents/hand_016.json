            "reasoning_content": "  Alright, let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - best position\n- Hand: 8\u2660 8\u2666 - Pocket 8s, a medium pocket pair\n- Stack: 211 chips (105.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- To call: 2 chips\n- Min raise: 4 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): SB position, 187 chips. Recent actions show they fold a lot preflop (hands 9, 11, 13, 14, 15) but they did raise to 6 in hand 12. They seem tight.\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): BB position, 222 chips. Very tight - has folded preflop in 8 out of 10 recent actions. Only raised once (hand 13) and showed aggression post-flop in that hand.\n\n**My recent play:** I've been very tight, folding 12 out of 15 hands. This means I likely have a tight image.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** Pocket 8s is a strong hand, especially from the button. It's vulnerable to overcards but has good potential.\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last post-flop.\n3. **Opponents:** Both opponents seem tight. The SB folds a lot, and the BB is extremely tight.\n4. **Tournament considerations:** With 105.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I should be looking to accumulate chips.\n5. **Pot odds:** Need to call 2 to win 3 (1.5:1), which is fine for pocket 8s.\n\n**Decision:** With a medium pocket pair on the button against two tight opponents, I should definitely play this hand. I have two options:\n\n- **Call (2 chips):** Play cautiously, see the flop. Risk is low, but I give the BB a chance to see a cheap flop with any two cards.\n- **Raise:** Take control of the hand. A standard raise would be 3x-4x the BB, so 6-8 chips.\n\nGiven that both opponents are tight and I have a tight image, a raise makes sense. It:\n1. Builds the pot when I likely have the best hand\n2. Gets value from hands that might call (like Ax, Kx, Qx, smaller pairs)\n3. Takes control of the hand\n4. Capitalizes on my tight image\n\nA raise to 6-8 chips seems appropriate. Let me go with 6 chips (3x BB) as it's the standard size and keeps my risk manageable.\n\n**Final decision:** Raise to 6 chips.",

Pot odds (31% equity needed) are borderline, but reverse implied odds and positional disadvantage make this a fold.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "I need to respond with the JSON format, but first I should think about the situation. I'm in the BB with 5d 6c. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 6 total (so 4 more to call). I have 222 chips (111 BB). The pot is 9 chips. I need to decide whether to fold, call, or raise.\n\nFirst, let me consider my hand: 5d 6c is a suited connector, but it's offsuit here. It's a speculative hand that plays well in multiway pots, but this is heads-up against a raiser. In the BB, I'm getting good pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 9, which is 2.25:1 odds, or about 31% equity needed. Against a typical raising range from UTG (Seat 1 is UTG?), actually Seat 1 is UTG? Let me check: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, Seat 2 is SB, Seat 3 is BB (me), Seat 4 is UTG? Wait, the positions: Seat 1 is first to act preflop? Actually, with 5 players: Seat 1 is UTG, Seat 2 is SB, Seat 3 is BB, Seat 4 is Button? Actually, the table order: Seat 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Seat 4 and 5 folded. So Seat 1 is UTG, raised. So it's a UTG raise.\n\nUTG raising range is typically tight: maybe top 15-20% of hands. 56o has about 30% equity against a top 15% range. Actually, let me estimate: 56o vs top 15% (22+, A2s+, K9s+, QTs+, JTs, T9s, 98s, 87s, 76s, 65s, AJo+, KQo) has about 32% equity. So I have roughly the required equity based on pot odds alone.\n\nBut there are other factors: position disadvantage (I'll be out of position postflop), stack sizes (I have 111 BB, opponent has 205 chips = 102.5 BB). Implied odds: if I hit a strong hand (two pair, straight, etc.), I can win more chips. Reverse implied odds: if I hit a marginal hand like a pair of 5s or 6s, I could lose a lot.\n\nAlso tournament considerations: I have a healthy stack (111 BB), so I can afford to take a speculative call. However, being out of position with a weak hand is not ideal.\n\nI should also consider opponent tendencies. Let me try to recall opponent actions, but the tool calls are failing. I need to respond in JSON format. Maybe I should just make a decision based on general principles.\n\nGiven the pot odds (31% equity needed) and my hand's approximate 32% equity against a tight range, it's a borderline call. However, being out of position reduces my postflop profitability. In tournament poker, defending the BB with 56o against an UTG raise is generally a fold at these stack depths (111 BB). At shorter stacks (like 20-30 BB), calling becomes more attractive due to implied odds being better relative to stack sizes.\n\nAlso, the raise size is 3x BB (6 total, so 4 more over my BB). That's a standard raise.\n\nI think the correct play is to fold. I'll save my chips for better spots. Let me craft the JSON response.",

This suggests they might be tight-passive or tight-aggressive.\n   - **Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**: This player has been folding a lot preflop too, but in hand 13 they raised to 6 preflop with Qd 3d (a very weak hand) and ended up winning.

I should preserve my stack and wait for better opportunities.\n\n7. **Hand strength**: J9 suited is not strong enough to play from UTG in most situations. While it has some potential for straights and flushes, it's generally considered a speculative hand that requires good position and favorable conditions to play profitably.\n\nGiven that I'm UTG with a mediocre hand, and considering that both opponents have shown a tendency to fold preflop (which means they likely have stronger hands when they do play), this seems like a clear fold situation.

That's a marginal hand UTG. Usually fold. Could consider call if cheap and maybe see flop cheap. But UTG raise would be too early. So fold likely.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies? Could recall opponent seat 2 (post_sb) maybe they are a loose player? But we are UTG, they are SB. The action so far: seat2 posted sb 1, seat3 posted bb 2, seat4 folded. So we face a bet of 2 from BB (post_bb). Actually amount to call is 2, which is the big blind. So we are facing a raise? No, it's just the big blind. So we can call 2 to see flop. With 8-9 off-suit, calling is maybe okay given cheap price and deep stacks. In tournament early stage, but we have 80 BB, deep. Could call to see flop for cheap. However UTG with 8-9 offsuit is not great, but many players call such hands in early stage. But we need to consider risk: if we call, we will be out of position postflop. Hand has potential for straights but not great.\n\nGiven the guidelines: we need to think step by step. Might be better to fold to preserve stack.\n\nLet's maybe recall opponent actions: seat2 (SB) maybe a loose player. But we are not facing them yet. The BB posted 2, but they might be tight. Not sure.\n\nGiven the hand, I think fold.\n\nThus output JSON with action fold, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

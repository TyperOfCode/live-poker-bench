Seems tight/passive. When they do play, they make small bets (2 chips on turn/river in hand 18).\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Also very tight preflop, folding most hands (19-22), only played hand 23 where they checked and then bet 4 on turn. Made a small raise here.\n\n**Pot odds**: Calling 4 to win 16 = 4:1 odds, which is good for a speculative hand like TJo.\n\n**Considerations**:\n1. TJo offsuit is marginal, especially OOP\n2. I'm getting good immediate pot odds\n3. Both opponents seem tight/passive\n4. If I hit a strong hand, I can likely get value from these passive players\n5. My stack is healthy enough to take a speculative call\n6. I'm out of position which is a disadvantage\n\n**Decision**: Calling seems reasonable here. The raise is small (min-raise), I'm getting good odds, and the opponents seem passive enough that I won't face difficult pressure postflop. I don't want to 3-bet with TJo OOP against two players, and folding seems too tight given the price.\n\nLet me call.",

The board is Qs Th 2d 5s. \n- Possible hands that beat me: Any queen (top pair), any two pair, sets, straights (unlikely with this board)\n- I have 4 outs to two pair (any jack), giving me ~8% equity\n- The board is relatively dry with no flush draws and only possible straight draws (KJ, J9, 43)\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the recall:\n- **GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5, SB):** Has been relatively passive, but is now betting aggressively. They raised preflop, bet flop, and now bet 50 on turn. This suggests they have a strong hand. They've shown aggression before but not consistently.\n\n- **MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4):** Has been folding a lot preflop. Called preflop, called flop, but hasn't shown much aggression. They called flop bet of 20 which could mean they have something but not super strong.\n\n**Pot odds:**\nPot is 134, I need to call 50.\nPot odds = 134:50 or 2.68:1\nI need ~27% equity to call profitably.\n\nI only have ~8% equity with my 4 outs to two pair. This is not enough to call based on pot odds alone.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\nI have 192 chips left. If I call 50, I'll have 142 left. If I raise, minimum is 100 which puts a lot of pressure on my stack.\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven:\n1. I only have middle pair with weak kicker\n2.

They just bet 20 into a 64 chip pot, which is about 31% pot size - this is a decent bet sizing.\n- **Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1)**: Has shown some aggressive play with raises preflop and bets on the flop in recent hands. They called the 20 bet.\n\n**Analysis of the situation:**\n- I have top pair with Tc 9s on board Qs Th 2d\n- This is a reasonably strong hand, but there are potential threats (flush draw with Qs, straight draws possible)\n- Two opponents are still in the hand, both called a 20 chip bet\n- I need to decide whether to call the 20 or raise\n\n**Considerations:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Top pair is decent but not premium - vulnerable to many hands\n2. **Position**: I'm in position, which is good for calling and seeing more cards\n3. **Stack sizes**: I'm relatively healthy (51.8 BB), can afford to play\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 20 to win a pot that will be 104 chips if I call (64 + 20 + 20) - about 19% pot odds\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Both seem to be playing reasonably tight but will bet when they have something\n \nI'm leaning towards a cautious approach. The pot odds and hand vulnerability suggest a careful call is most prudent. While my top pair is playable, the multiple opponents and potential draws make a raise too risky. I'll keep my options open by calling and observing the turn card's impact on the hand's dynamics.\n",

However, when they do bet (like the 4-chip bet on turn in hand #23), it often indicates strength.\n\n**Situation:**\n- Pot is 134, I need to call 50 (pot odds ~2.7:1)\n- Stack sizes: I have 187, opponent has 82\n- Two players (Seat 1) already folded to the 50 bet\n- I'm getting good pot odds with my draws and pair\n\n**Decision:**\nWith top pair and two draws, I have sufficient equity to call this bet.

They missed their draw (maybe they had a flush draw with spades)\n  2. They have a weaker hand now\n  3. They're trying to induce a bluff\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Amount to call: 0 (they checked)\n\n\n- I'll evaluate my betting options carefully\n- Checking seems most prudent given my marginal hand\n- The board is relatively coordinated, and my pair of tens isn't particularly strong\n- Betting could risk unnecessary chips against a potentially tricky opponent\n- Passing allows me to see a potential showdown with minimal risk\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- My chip stack is relatively healthy at 137 chips\n- Opponent's stack is smaller at 82 chips\n- No compelling reason to take aggressive action\n- Maintaining chip stack stability is key in this tournament situation\n\nI'll proceed cautiously, recognizing the nuanced dynamics of the current hand.\n\nThe board reveals potential straight and flush opportunities that could easily outmaneuver my current hand strength. Checking emerges as the most prudent strategy, allowing me to navigate the hand's complexity without unnecessary risk.\n\nBy calling the initial bet, I gained valuable insight into the hand's progression. The turn bet and subsequent fold by another player provided crucial context about the board's potential. My call demonstrated strategic flexibility, keeping options open while maintaining chip conservation.\n\nThe river check presents an intriguing scenario. With 184 chips in the pot and facing a potential check, I'll carefully evaluate my position. The board's composition - including a queen, ten, and potential flush possibilities - requires nuanced assessment. My current hand strength, likely a pair of tens, demands careful consideration of potential opponent holdings.\n\nThe key is balancing chip preservation with potential value extraction. Checking preserves my stack while avoiding unnecessary risks, especially given the board's complex texture and the unknown nature of my opponent's potential hands.",

Betting here would be thin value at best and could get called by better hands.\n\nThe correct response should be:\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have middle pair (tens) on a coordinated board. Opponent checked after betting strong on flop/turn, suggesting they may have weakened.\"\n}\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We have hand #24 preflop. Position SB, Js Kd. Stack 158 chips, 39.5 BB. Blinds 2/4, pot 10 (SB 2 + BB 4). Action: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, seat4 (MiniMax-M2) calls 4 (so they just called). Amount to call is 2 (SB's to call the BB's 4? Actually SB posted 2, BB posted 4, seat4 called 4, so SB now needs to call 2 more to match 4). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to total 8). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Hand JsKd suited? No, Js of spades, Kd diamond, unsuited. In SB, we are out of position, short stack? 39.5 BB, not short. J\u2660 K\u2666 is a decent hand, decent equity vs random, but against a call from BB (who could be tight?), we need to consider. The BB is Kimi-K2? Actually seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (maybe the BB). The BB's name is \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\". We have no recall data about that opponent's raise patterns. Could recall opponent actions for Kimi-K2 (BB) but not needed.\n\nWe can consider raising to isolate. Minimum raise to 8 total (so raise by 4 more). That would be a 4x raise (from 4 to 8). In SB, raising is typical with strong hands, but J\u2660K\u2666 is borderline. Many players raise with KJ, but it's okay. Considering we are out of position, raising isolates and can take the pot preflop. But also risk of being 3-bet and out of position. However, the BB is unknown. The other player (MiniMax-M2) just called, which indicates they have a wide range. So raising could be good to isolate and potentially take down the pot preflop or go heads-up with BB.\n\nStack depth: 39.5 BB, raising to 8 is ~2 BB, small raise. Could also just call and see flop out of position. But we have J\u2660K\u2666, good for post-flop play, but out of position SB vs BB and MP. Might want to raise to thin the field.\n\nPot odds: If we call, we invest 2 chips, pot becomes 12. If we raise to 8, we invest 8 total (i.e., additional 6 chips). The pot would be 10+2 (call) +6 raise? Actually after raise, the pot would be 10 (original) + 2 (SB call) + 4 (BB) + 4 (MP call) + (raise to 8 total from SB, meaning SB adds 6 more) = 24? Let's compute: initial pot 10 (SB 2 + BB 4). MP calls 4, so pot 14. SB call 2 to match 4, pot 16. If SB raises to 8, they add 4 more (since they already called 2? Actually they need to put total 8, so they add 6 more). So pot becomes 22 (16+6). So raise adds 6 chips. That seems okay.\n\nGiven J\u2660K\u2666 is a decent hand, raising to 8 to isolate is reasonable. Also we have decent stack, can play postflop.\n\nThus action: raise to 8.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Actually board Q T 2, we have J, so we have open-ended? Let's see: Q T 2, we have J, so we have JQ T = straight? Actually need 9 or K for straight. With J, we have JQ T = need K or 9 for straight. So we have gutshot (need K) and also have backdoor flush draw? Suits: board Qs Th 2d, we have Js (spade) and Kd (diamond). So we have a flush draw with spades: board has Qs, we have Js, need another spade. So we have nut flush draw? Actually highest spade on board is Qs, we have Js, so we need Ace or King spade for nut flush, but we have Kd not spade. So we have a nut flush draw? No, we have J spade, board Q spade, so we have two spades, need Ace or King spade for nut flush, but we don't have them, but we could still make a flush (non-nut). So we have a gutshot straight draw and a flush draw (two outs for flush? Actually we have two spades, need any spade (9 spades left? 13 total spades, 2 on board, 1 in hand = 3 spades known, so 10 spades left). So decent draw.\n\nPot is 24 chips. Stack 152. Opponents: Seat1 Kimi-K2 (212 chips) is BB, Seat4 MiniMax-M2 (207 chips) called preflop and is in the hand. So we have two opponents: BB and MP (seat4). Both have called the preflop raise. No flop betting yet, amount to call 0, min raise 4, legal actions fold, check, raise.\n\nWe need to decide whether to bet (raise) or check. Consider opponent tendencies: we have no data from recall. Could attempt to recall previous actions of Kimi-K2 and MiniMax-M2 on flop. The recall returned none. So we have no history. Could assume typical.\n\nOur hand is a strong draw with potential to make top pair? Actually we have no pair currently. Board Q T 2, we have J, K, so we have gutshot to straight, flush draw, also have overcards (K and J). Could be a decent semi-bluff. Pot is 24, we have 152 left, so can bet around pot size to apply pressure. Raising to maybe 20-30 chips. Minimum raise is 4, but we could raise to 20 (which is total). That would be ~0.8 pot.\n\nConsider tournament stage: we have 38 BB, medium stack. Should preserve chips but also build. A semi-bluff could win pot now or set up future.\n\nCheck could allow free cards, but we risk giving free check-raise? Not likely.\n\nThus I think raise to maybe 20 chips (total). Reason: we have strong draws, want to put pressure, also protect against opponent making pair. Also we have decent stack to risk.\n\nThus action: raise to 20.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

Actually with J we have J gives us straight: Ten-J-Q-K-A? Wait we have K and J, board: Q T 2 5. So we have K-J, board Q T, that gives us a straight draw: need A or 9 for straight? Let's see: possible straights: 9-T-J-Q-K (need 9) or T-J-Q-K-A (need A). So two outs for straight (9 and A). Also we have backdoor flush? Board has two spades (Qs,5s) and we have Js (spade). So we have three spades, need one more spade on river for flush. So we have open-ended? Actually we have 3 spades, need one more for flush (9 outs approx). So total outs: 2 straight outs + 9 flush outs (but some overlap: the 9 of spades is both straight and flush? 9 spade counts both, also A spade counts both? A spade also straight? A spade would give A-high straight (T-J-Q-K-A) plus flush. So overlapping reduces total outs a bit. Rough estimate ~13 outs.\n\nPot is 84, we are facing amount to call 0 (we are first to act on turn). Actually actions: after flop betting, everyone called. Turn now: we have option to check or raise. Opponent(s): Seat1 Kimi-K2 (SB? Actually seat1 is BB?), seat4 MiniMax-M2. Both have called flop bet. We are SB, seat5. So we have two opponents.\n\nWe have 132 chips stack, pot 84, effective stack maybe 132 (our stack) vs opponents maybe similar.\n\nWe have decent draw with decent pot odds. Turn bet size? We can bet to build pot or to protect. With 13 outs, need about 13/47\u224827% chance to hit on river. Pot odds if we bet and get called? If we bet X and they call, we get pot+X+call. But we could also check and hope to see river cheap.\n\nGiven we have a draw, it's often good to bet to charge draws and get value if they have made hand. Opponents: Kimi-K2 previously bet 20 on flop, seems aggressive. MiniMax-M2 called. Could have made pair Q, T, or straight draws.\n\nOur hand currently is a gutshot? Actually we have two pair? No, we have J K, board Q T 2 5. No pair. So we are drawing.\n\nWe could bet around half pot (maybe 40-50) to get value and protect. But we must consider stack sizes: we have 132, pot 84, betting 40 leaves us 92 left. Opponents could call.\n\nCheck is also possible to see river cheap, but gives free card.\n\nGiven tournament, we have decent stack (33 BB). We can afford to be aggressive.\n\nThus I think raise (bet) to maybe 50 chips (total bet amount). Minimum raise is 20 (since previous bet? Actually no previous bet on turn, amount to call 0, min raise to 20). So we can raise to 50.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 bet on flop 20 (small). Might be medium strength. MiniMax-M2 called, maybe also medium.\n\nThus a bet of 50 could extract value from hands like Qx, Tx, maybe pair.\n\nI'll decide to raise to 50.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

Actually board: Q T 2 5 K. Our hand: J K. So we have pair of Kings, plus we have a straight? Let's see: Q-J-10? We have J, board has Q and T, that's a gutshot to straight (J would give J-Q-T-9-8? No). Straight possibilities: 9-8-7-6? No. So only pair.\n\nBoard: Qs Th 2d 5s Kh. Possible hands opponent could have: they could have a set? No board pairs. Could have two pair: QK? They could have QK (but we have Kd, they could have Qx). Could have straight: A-9? Not. Could have flush? Board has two spades: Qs, Ts, 5s. So three spades? Actually Qs, Ts, 5s are spades, that's three spades. Opponent could have two spades for flush, but we have Js (spade) and Kd. So we have one spade, opponent could have two spades for flush. Potential flush draws: they could have As? Actually need two spades: any two spades. So they could have A\u26609\u2660 etc.\n\nOur opponent: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4). Their actions: preflop they called 4 (small blind?), they called our raise preflop. Then flop they called 20 (we bet 20). Turn we bet 50, they called. River: amount to call 0, we can check or raise. So they have shown willingness to call bets on flop and turn. We bet 20 on flop, they called. Turn we bet 50 (which is 50 into pot? pot after turn: preflop pot? Let's compute: preflop: we raised to 8, others called 4 each. So pot after preflop: 2 (SB) +4 (BB) +4 (call) +8 (our raise) +4 (call) = 22? Wait details: SB 2, BB 4, we raise to 8 (so we add 8? Actually raise from 4 to 8, we put 8 total). Then seat1 call 4, seat4 call 4. So total contributions: SB 2, BB 4 (but we raised to 8, meaning we added 4 more?), Actually raise to 8 means we put total 8 chips. So contributions: SB 2, BB 8, seat1 4, seat4 4 = 18. But pot shown is 184 at river, so many bets later.\n\nFlop bet 20 each, pot becomes 18+20+20+20 = 78? Actually we bet 20, they each called 20, so add 60, pot 78.\n\nTurn bet 50 each, we bet 50, they called 50, add 100, pot 178. River amount to call 0, pot 184 (so maybe some rounding). So we have pot 184.\n\nNow we need to decide to check or raise. Opponent's stack: they have 137 chips total, after calling 50 on turn they have 137-? They started with 137, posted small blind? Actually seat4 is not blind, seat5 is BB. Seat4 called 4 preflop (so they put 4). Flop called 20, turn called 50. So total they've invested: 4+20+50 = 74. Their remaining stack = 137 - 74 = 63 chips. So they have 63 chips left.\n\nWe have 82 chips, we posted 2 sb? Actually we are BB, posted 4, raised to 8 (so extra 4). So our total invested: 8 preflop, 20 flop, 50 turn = 78. Our remaining stack = 82-78 = 4 chips left (including any remaining? Actually we have 4 chips left, which is less than the opponent's stack. So we are short-stacked relative to opponent but not all-in yet. However we cannot raise more than our remaining stack? We can go all-in for 4 chips. Minimum raise is 50 (the amount we bet on turn?), but we only have 4 chips left, so we cannot raise the minimum, so we can only check or go all-in? The rules: If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in. So we could go all-in for 4 chips (which is less than min raise). That's allowed.\n\nThus options: check"

Actually board Q T 5 K, they could have QJ for two pair QK? Wait board has Q and K, so QJ gives pair of Qs and K? Actually they would have Q in hand, board Q, so they'd have trips?

So raising all-in is not good; we would lose 4 chips more. Better to check and hope they check, but they have 63 left and could also bet. However we cannot raise more than 4, but we could check and let them bet. If they bet, we could fold or call?

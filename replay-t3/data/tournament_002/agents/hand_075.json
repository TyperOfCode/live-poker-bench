Looking at their recent actions:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 68, 69, 70, 74)\n- When they do raise, they tend to raise big (118, 166, 40, and now 48)\n- They went to showdown with strong hands like AK, KT, K9\n\nThis suggests Seat 2 is playing relatively tight and when they raise, they likely have a strong hand.\n\nHand strength:\n- K6o is a weak hand, dominated by many hands that would raise\n- We're out of position\n- No suitedness, no connectivity\n\nStack considerations:\n- I have 130 chips (8.1 BB)\n- Calling would cost me 32 chips (25% of my stack)\n- If I call and miss the flop, I'll be in a tough spot out of position\n- This is a tournament, so preserving my stack is important\n\nPot odds:\n- Need to call 32 to win 72\n- Getting about 2.25:1 odds\n- With K6o, this is not enough even if opponent is raising wide\n\nGiven that Seat 2 seems to be a tight player who raises with strong hands, and I have a weak hand out of position with a short stack, this is a clear fold. I should preserve my chips for a better spot.",

While suited, it lacks the strength to play well out of position.\n\n**Position Disadvantage**: Being in the Small Blind puts me in the worst position, making it difficult to control pot size or extract value.\n\n**Opponent Profile**: Kimi-K2 has been raising with strong hands recently (showing Ah-Kd and Tc-Kc at showdown). The 48-chip raise suggests significant strength.\n\n**Consistent Play**: Looking at my SB history, I've consistently folded similar weak hands like Qc-6d preflop (hand #53) and 8c-Tc (hand #48). Qc-8s doesn't offer significantly better playability than these hands I chose to fold.\n\n**Stack Preservation**: With 37.2 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots to stay alive in the tournament.\n\nThe pot odds aren't favorable enough to justify calling with this weak hand out of position against a likely strong opponent.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Qc-8s is too weak to play out of position against a likely strong opponent.

Qc-8s is not significantly better than these hands I've folded, and I'm facing a strong raise from an opponent who has shown strong hands recently.\n\nThe hand 53 where I folded Qc-6d is particularly relevant - it's very similar to my current hand (Q with a low kicker), and I chose to fold that preflop. Qc-8s is only marginally better than Qc-6d.\n\nGiven all this analysis, the clear decision is to fold.",

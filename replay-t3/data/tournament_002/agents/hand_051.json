Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand #51 - PREFLOP**\n\n- **My Position**: BTN (Seat 1) - Button, which is the best position\n- **My Cards**: Qh 3d - Queen of hearts, 3 of diamonds. This is a very weak hand, not suited, not connected, low kicker.\n- **My Stack**: 202 chips (25.2 BB) - This is a relatively short stack in tournament terms\n- **Blinds**: 4/8\n- **Pot**: 12 chips\n\n**Players at table**:\n- Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 202 chips (ME)\n- Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 156 chips (SB)\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 188 chips (BB)\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 249 chips (folded)\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 193 chips (folded)\n\n**Actions this hand**:\n- preflop: Seat 2 post_sb 4\n- preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 8\n- preflop: Seat 4 fold\n- preflop: Seat 5 fold\n\n**Amount to call**: 8\n**Minimum raise to**: 16\n**Legal actions**: fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponent Analysis**:\n\nI used the recall_opponent_actions tool to gather information about both opponents:\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2 in SB)**:\n- Hand 47: preflop fold\n- Hand 48: preflop fold\n- Hand 49: preflop raise to 24, then flop bet 48, flop raise to 144, turn check, river check - This suggests a very strong hand preflop that they were willing to go big with\n- Hand 50: preflop call 12, flop check, turn fold - This suggests they called a raise preflop but gave up on the turn\n- Showdowns: Kd 9d (hand 27), Tc Kc (hand 49)\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB)**:\n- Hands 40-47: preflop fold every time (8 consecutive folds)\n- Hand 48: preflop raise to 20\n- Hand 49: preflop fold\n- Hand 50: preflop fold\n- Showdowns: Qd 3d (hand 13), Ks Ah (hand 29)\n\n**Analysis**:\n\n1. **My Hand**: Qh 3d is extremely weak. Queen-high with a 3 kicker is not a hand I want to play, especially from the button when there are only two players left to act (SB and BB).\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good, but with such a weak hand, position advantage is minimized.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**:\n   - **SB (Seat 2)**: Seems to play relatively tight but can make big raises with strong hands (hand 49). They also called a raise preflop in hand 50 but folded on the turn. They seem capable of making moves.\n   - **BB (Seat 3)**: Very tight! They've folded 8 out of 9 hands preflop, only raising once. This suggests they're playing a very tight, conservative game. They're likely to have a strong hand when they don't fold.\n\n4. **Stack Sizes**: \n   - I have 202 chips (25.2 BB)\n   - SB has 156 chips (19.5 BB)\n   - BB has 188 chips (23.5 BB)\n   - All stacks are relatively shallow, which means we should be more cautious with marginal hands.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 8 to win a pot of 12. That's 1.5:1 odds, which requires me to win at least 40% of the time. With Q3o, I definitely don't have that equity against any reasonable range.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 25.2 BB, I'm in a decent position but not comfortable. I should be looking to preserve my stack or find good spots to accumulate chips. Q3o is not a good spot.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. Q3o is one of the weakest hands in poker, and even on the button, I don't want to get involved with such a weak hand against two opponents when I have no information that they're playing extremely loose. The BB is particularly tight, so if I call and they raise, I'll be in a tough spot. If I raise, I might get called by the SB or re-raised by the BB, and then I'll be building a pot with a hand that has very"

This suggests they likely have a strong hand when they reach the turn.\n\n5. **Board analysis**: The board is relatively dry with no flush draws possible (only two clubs and no other suited cards). There are some straight draws with 6-8-Q-4, but nothing too threatening to my ace-high.\n\n6. **Stack considerations**: With 19 BB, I have a medium stack that I need to protect. Taking down this small pot (16 chips) would add about 10% to my stack.\n\n7. **Betting pattern**: Both players checked the flop, suggesting neither has a particularly strong hand. However, DeepSeek-V3.2's tight nature means they could still have something like middle pair or a weak queen.\n\nGiven that I have ace-high, position advantage, and my opponent showed weakness by checking twice, I should take a stab at this pot. A small bet should be enough to make hands like 6x, 8x, or random club draws fold.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 12,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Taking advantage of position and ace-high strength against a tight opponent who checked twice.

So the pot is 16 chips (SB 4 + BB 8 + call 4). I have 188 chips (23.5 BB). Seat 2 has 152 chips.\n\nI'm in the BB, and it's heads-up against the SB who just completed.

A standard raise would be to 24-32 chips (3-4x). But with 5-9 offsuit, it's not a great hand to play post-flop, especially out of position (though I will have position this hand since SB acts first post-flop).\n\nActually wait: I'm BB, SB acts first preflop but post-flop, the SB acts first on each street. So I have position for the rest of the hand. That's good.\n\nGiven the weak hand and that I'm already in for 8 chips, checking to see a free flop seems reasonable. If I hit something like a pair or draw, I can continue. Otherwise, I can fold cheaply.\n\nRaising might get a fold, but if called, I'm playing a weak hand out of position with a raised pot. Not ideal.\n\nLet me check: minimum raise to is 16 (total). That's just adding 8 more chips. If I raise to 16, opponent needs to call 8 more. They might call with many hands.\n\nBetter to just check and see the flop. 5-9 offsuit is not a hand I want to put more chips in with.\n\nDecision: check. Let's see the flop.",

I have 188 chips (23.5 BB). Amount to call is 0, so I can check or raise.\n\n**Hand analysis:** I have 5c 9h on a 6s 8c Qc board. This is a weak hand - bottom pair with 9-high. I have a gutshot straight draw (7 would give me a straight), but it's not a great draw. The Q on board is likely to have hit many hands. My 9 gives me bottom pair, which is very weak.\n\n**Position:** I'm out of position as BB, which makes it harder to play this hand.\n\n**Opponent analysis:** Looking at Kimi-K2's recent actions:\n- Hand 49: They raised preflop to 24, then bet 48 on flop, then raised to 144 on flop (aggressive play)\n- Hand 50: They called preflop (12 chips), checked flop, folded turn\n- They seem capable of aggressive play but also cautious\n\n**Stack sizes:** I have 188 chips, opponent has 152 chips. Both are relatively short (19-23.5 BB).\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 23.5 BB, I need to preserve stack but also look for spots to accumulate. This doesn't seem like a good spot to get involved with a weak hand.\n\n**Potential outcomes:** If I check, we see a turn for free. If I bet, I'm likely only getting called by better hands or draws that have good equity against me. My hand has very little showdown value and poor equity.\n\n**Decision:** Best to check and see a free turn card. If I hit my gutshot (a 7), I could potentially win a big pot. But betting here with a weak hand out of position is not good. Checking allows me to realize my equity for free and potentially bluff on later streets if the right cards come.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Weak hand (bottom pair with 9-high) out of position.

I have 188 chips total (23.5 BB). Opponent has 140 chips.\n\nMy hand: 5c 9h. I have a gutshot straight draw: I need a 7 to make a straight (5-6-7-8-9). There's also a flush draw with clubs on board (6s 8c Qc 4d - two clubs). I have 5c, so I have a flush draw too. Actually, board has two clubs: 8c and Qc. I have 5c, so I have a flush draw with three clubs. That's decent.\n\nPot odds: pot is 28 + 12 bet = 40 total if I call. I need to call 12 to win 40, so pot odds are 12/40 = 30%. My equity: I have a gutshot straight draw (4 outs) and a flush draw (9 outs, but need to discount for overlapping). Actually, I have 9 clubs remaining (13 total, minus 5c, 8c, Qc = 10? Wait: 13 clubs total, I have 5c, board has 8c and Qc, so 3 seen, 10 remaining). But some clubs might also be 7c which would give me straight flush draw. However, I need to discount for possible opponent having higher flush draw. But let's estimate: I have about 12-14 outs. That's about 25-30% equity on the turn. Pot odds 30% is close.\n\nBut implied odds: if I hit my flush or straight on river, I might get more chips. Opponent has 140 chips behind, I have 188. If I call 12 now, pot becomes 52. River I could potentially bet if I hit.\n\nOpponent tendencies: Let me recall opponent actions. Use tool.",

Looking at their actions: they raised preflop in hand 49 with Tc Kc, then bet flop, raised flop, then checked turn and river. They also called preflop in hand 50 and folded on turn. They seem aggressive but not overly so.\n\nMy hand: 5c 9h. I have 4 outs to a straight (any 7). That's about 8.7% equity (4/46 cards). Even if I give myself some extra outs for runner-runner flush or two pair, it's not enough to justify calling.\n\nAlso, I'm in position (BB) but opponent acted first on turn. They bet 12 into 28, which is a small bet (less than half pot). This could be a probe bet with a weak hand, but my hand is even weaker.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 188 chips (23.5 BB).

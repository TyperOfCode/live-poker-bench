The raise to 14 here (3.5x BB) is larger than previous raises.\n\n**Position considerations:**\n- I'm in SB, worst position postflop\n- BB still to act behind me if I call\n- If I call, BB may squeeze with a strong hand\n\n**Hand strength:**\nA7o is not a great hand, especially out of position. It's dominated by many Ax hands that would raise (AJ+, AT+, maybe A9s). The 7 kicker is weak.\n\n**Stack sizes:**\n- I have 210 chips, opponent has 153\n- If I call and play postflop, I'll be playing a medium-sized pot out of position with a marginal hand\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nAt 52.5 BB, I don't need to take marginal spots. I can wait for better opportunities.\n\n**Alternatives:**\n- Fold: Preserve stack, avoid difficult postflop play\n- Call: See flop, but likely face continuation bets\n- Raise: Could 3-bet, but with A7o and out of position, not ideal\n\n**Decision:**\nThe pot odds (37.5% equity needed) are tempting, but A7o likely has less than 37.5% equity against a tight raising range. Plus, being out of position makes this even worse. The BB behind could squeeze. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"A7o out of position against a tight raiser (Kimi-K2 has raised 11.5% of hands).

There are many better hands that could be out there:\n- Any pair (88, 66, 55, 33, or pocket pairs)\n- Straights (47, 57, 67, etc.)\n- Flushes (any two diamonds)\n- Two pair combinations\n\nGiven that I can check for free and see what happens, this seems like the best play. If my opponent bets, I can evaluate whether to call or fold based on the size and my reads on them.\n\nMy memory shows I've been folding a lot from the BB position (20 folds out of 26 hands), so I'm being selective.

In the previous hand, they raised preflop but folded to continued aggression.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Pot is 60 chips, I can check or raise (minimum 15)\n- Opponent called my flop bet but checked turn, suggesting moderate strength\n- Given their tight tendencies, they likely don't have a strong hand\n\n**Decision Rationale:**\nWith top pair on this board and facing a tight opponent who has shown restraint, I believe I have the best hand most of the time. A bet of 15 chips (25% pot) is well-sized to get value from worse hands like Ace-high, smaller pairs, or draws that missed. If they have a better hand (like A-K or A-Q), they'll likely call or raise.\n\nThe bet also gives me a chance to win the pot immediately if they have a weaker hand and decide to fold.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 15,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have top pair (Jack) on Ace-high board which is likely ahead of opponent's range. Against tight player Kimi-K2, betting 15 chips for value makes sense to get called by worse hands like Ace-high or smaller pairs.\"\n}\n```",

The tight opponent's pattern suggests they likely have a weak hand. With my top pair Jack-King and the disconnected board, I can confidently bet to extract value. The 15-chip bet represents an optimal sizing to encourage a call from a player who's been consistently folding weak hands. This approach balances aggression with calculated risk, potentially winning the pot without excessive exposure.\n",

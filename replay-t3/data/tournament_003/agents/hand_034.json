            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My position: BTN (Button)\n- My cards: 5d Qh (unsuited, low-medium strength)\n- My stack: 104 chips (26 BB)\n- Pot: 8 chips\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Opponent Information (GPT-OSS-120B in SB):**\n- Position: SB (Seat 5)\n- Stack: 186 chips\n- Just called 2 chips (completing the blind)\n- Recent preflop actions show: mostly folding, occasional raises (including a big 162 chip raise in hand 28), and one call\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: Q5o is a relatively weak hand. It's not connected, not suited, and the queen is vulnerable to domination.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position post-flop. This gives me an advantage.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32), but has shown they can raise big (hand 28 with 162 chips). They just called the SB, which could mean:\n   - They have a marginal hand they want to see a flop with cheaply\n   - They're trying to trap with a strong hand\n   - They're just completing the blind\n\n4. **Stack Sizes**: I have 104 chips (26 BB), which is a decent stack. I can afford to see a flop here since there's no additional cost (amount to call is 0).\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: The pot is 8 chips and I can check for free, so infinite pot odds to see the flop.\n\n6. **Tournament Consideration**: I'm not desperate yet with 26 BB. I can afford to see a flop in position with a weak hand since it's free. If I hit something strong (like two pair, trips, straight draw), I can potentially win a decent pot. If I miss completely, I can easily fold.\n\n7. **Risk/Reward**: Checking risks nothing. If I raise, I'm bloating the pot with a weak hand out of position post-flop (since SB will act first on all streets). This is generally not advisable with Q5o.\n\n**Decision**: I should check and see a free flop in position. There's no reason to raise with this weak hand, and I have good position to evaluate post-flop.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 5d Qh (offsuit, not connected)\n- Board: 6h Js 4c\n- Position: BTN (good position)\n- Stack: 104 chips (26 BB)\n- Pot: 8 chips\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B has checked to me on the flop\n\n**Hand strength:** I have Q-high with no pair, no draw. This is a very weak hand.\n\n**Position:** I have position advantage on the flop since I'm on the BTN and acting last.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at the recall data for GPT-OSS-120B:\n- They frequently fold preflop (hands 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32)\n- When they do enter pots, they often check-fold on the flop (hands 18, 19)\n- They've made some large preflop raises (hand 21: 28 chips, hand 28: 162 chips)\n- They called preflop in hand 31 and then folded\n\nThe opponent just checked on the flop, which based on their pattern, often indicates weakness. However, I have absolutely nothing - just Q-high. The board has a J and 6, 4 - all disconnected. \n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 8 chips, it costs me 0 to check. If I bet, minimum raise is 4 chips.\n\n**Decision:** Even though the opponent showed weakness by checking, I have a terrible hand. Q-high is unlikely to be good here. The opponent could have:\n- Any pair (Jx, 6x, 4x)\n- Any draw (though not many draws on this board)\n- Or they could genuinely be weak\n\nBut with Q-high, I'm basically bluffing if I bet. While a small bluff might work given their check-fold tendencies, I also need to consider that:\n1. This is a tournament and I should be somewhat protective of my 26 BB stack\n2. The board is somewhat dry but not great for a bluff\n\n\n3. I have no equity if called\n4. I can check and see a free card to potentially improve\n\nA cautious approach makes the most sense here. Checking costs nothing and gives me a chance to see another card without risking chips. The free card might improve my hand, and I'll reassess based on the opponent's next action. Checking is the most prudent move given my complete lack of hand strength.",

Just Queen-high.\n- The board has a possible flush draw (clubs) and straight possibilities (3-5, 4-6, etc.)\n\n**Opponent analysis (Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see:\n- They check-fold frequently postflop (hands 18, 19)\n- They make occasional preflop raises (hands 21, 23, 25, 28)\n- In hand 28 they raised 162 chips (very large raise)\n- They seem to be a tight-aggressive player who folds to pressure\n\n**Current action:**\n- Preflop: I was BB, they were SB. They called 2, I checked.\n- Flop: They checked, I checked.\n- Turn: They checked.\n\nThis pattern suggests weakness. They've checked twice now, showing no aggression.\n\n**My decision:**\nI have absolutely nothing (Queen-high). The board is coordinated with straight and flush draws possible. Even though my opponent has shown weakness by checking twice, I have a very weak hand with no draw. \n\nChecking is the correct play here because:\n1. I have no hand strength\n2. No draws\n3. The board is coordinated and could easily have hit their range\n4. I'm out of position (though I'm actually on the button, so I have position)\n\n\n5. No value in betting - I can't get called by worse\n\nI'll carefully consider a potential bluff. The opponent's pattern of frequent folding suggests some opportunity, but my current hand is too weak to risk chips. The free card offers a chance to improve without additional investment. Checking maintains my tournament life and avoids unnecessary chip loss with a marginal hand.\n\nThe strategic move is clear: take the free card, preserve my stack, and wait for a stronger opportunity to apply pressure.

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- My cards: 5d Qh (offsuit, low cards)\n- Board: 6h Js 4c 2c 3c\n- Position: BTN\n- Stack: 104 chips (26 BB)\n- Pot: 8 chips\n- Opponent: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) with 186 chips\n- Action: Opponent checked on river, I can check or bet\n\n**Board Analysis:**\nThe board shows: 6h Js 4c 2c 3c\nThis is an interesting board - there's a club flush possible (4c 2c 3c + two more clubs), and also a straight possibility with 6-5-4-3-2. \n\nWith my hand 5d Qh:\n- I have a straight! 6-5-4-3-2 makes a 6-high straight\n- No flush (I have 5d)\n- My Q is irrelevant\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at the opponent's history:\n- They frequently fold preflop (hands 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32)\n- When they do enter pots, they sometimes raise big (hand 21: raise to 28, hand 28: raise to 162)\n- They've shown willingness to fold on flops (hands 18, 19, 31)\n- In this hand, they just called preflop (2 chips) and have checked all streets\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- They checked to me on the river\n- Pot is small (8 chips)\n- I have a straight, which is likely the best hand\n- The flush didn't complete (only 3 clubs on board)\n- No higher straight is possible (the only higher straight would be 7-6-5-4-3, but there's no 7)\n\n**Decision:**\nI have a strong hand (straight) and should bet for value. Since the pot is small and my opponent has been passive, I should make a value bet. \n\nGiven the pot is 8 chips, a bet of around 50-75% pot (4-6 chips) seems appropriate. However, I need to consider:\n1. If I bet too small, I might not get enough value\n2. If I bet too big, they might fold\n\nLet me make a value bet of 6 chips (75% pot) to try to get called by worse hands like pairs, two pairs, or maybe a lower straight if they somehow have it.\n\nActually, looking at the board again: 6h Js 4c 2c 3c\nWait, let me recount: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 would be a straight. But I have 5d Qh, so I have 5, Q. The board has 6, J, 4, 2, 3.\n\nSo my cards + board = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 = YES, I have a 6-high straight!\n\nThis is the nuts (best possible hand) on this board, since no higher straight or flush is possible.\n\nGiven I have the absolute nuts, I should bet for value. The opponent has shown passivity by checking all streets. I should make a value bet that they might call with weaker hands.\n\nGiven the pot is 8 chips, a bet of 6-8 chips seems reasonable. Let me go with 6 chips to give them a chance to call.",

Minimum raise to 8. Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nLet me think about this hand:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A6o is a weak hand from UTG. Ace-rag offsuit is generally a fold from early position. It has some high card value but is easily dominated by better aces.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll have to act first on every street, which is a significant disadvantage.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 48 BB is a decent stack, not desperate. I can afford to be patient.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: \n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (BB, seat 1, 104 chips): Has been fairly tight, folding preflop in 3 of last 4 hands, but did raise to 28 in hand 31.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, 297 chips): Has shown some aggression with raises preflop in hands 30 and 31.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (SB, seat 5, 188 chips): Has shown some aggression with a huge 162 chip raise in hand 28, but also many folds.\n\n5. **Table dynamics**: Two players behind me (MiniMax-M2 and GPT-OSS-120B) have shown willingness to raise. I could face a re-raise if I just call.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 48 BB, I'm not in push-or-fold territory. I should be playing tighter from early position.\n\nStandard poker strategy says A6o from UTG is a clear fold. Even if I call, I'm out of position with a weak hand that can get me into trouble. The only real reason to play would be if I think I can steal the blinds, but from UTG with 5 players left to act, that's unlikely.\n\nThe pot odds: 4 to call into 6 pot (1.5:1), but implied odds are poor because I'm out of position with a weak hand.\n\nGiven all this, folding is the correct play. I should wait for a better spot, especially from early position.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns I should consider... Looking at my hand history, I've folded my last 5 hands. That's okay - I need to be patient in tournaments. The opponents seem somewhat active but not overly aggressive.\n\nDecision: Fold.",

            "content": "Looking at this situation, I have Kc 2s on the button. This is a very weak hand with poor playability. Let me analyze the key factors:\n\n**Hand Analysis**: K2 offsuit is one of the weakest starting hands in poker. The kicker is terrible, and it has very little postflop potential.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies**: From my memory, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been quite tight, folding in 7 out of 10 recent hands preflop. This suggests they're likely to have a decent hand if they continue.\n\n**Position & Stack**: While I'm in the best position (button), I have 74 BB and don't need to take risks with marginal hands.\n\n**Pot Odds**: Although getting 4 chips to call for a 6-chip pot seems attractive, the hand quality is so poor that it rarely justifies investment.\n\n**Decision**: Despite the cheap price to call, K2 offsuit is simply too weak to play profitably. Even against a tight opponent, I'm likely dominated by any King, and the 2 kicker provides minimal protection. The risk of being outkicked is very high.\n\nFolding preserves my stack for better opportunities and is the most mathematically sound decision with this hand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Kc 2s is an extremely weak hand with poor playability. Against a likely tight opponent who has been folding frequently, this hand has minimal equity and high risk of being dominated. Better to wait for a stronger hand.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "Based on the information gathered:\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\n- Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been mostly folding preflop (7 out of 10 recent hands), with one raise to 28 chips. This suggests they play tight and only raise with strong hands.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been more active with raises, including one large raise to 162 chips. This suggests they might be more aggressive or willing to take risks.\n\n**My recent performance:**\n- I've been playing reasonably well with a 27% win rate over 33 hands\n- I won a recent hand with Ks 2c (similar hand) in the CO position by raising preflop and winning 22 chips without showdown\n- I've been mixing calls and raises from the button position\n\n**Current situation analysis:**\n- I have Kc 2s - a very weak hand\n- I need to call 4 chips to see the flop\n- The pot is 6 chips (very small)\n- I'm getting 1.5:1 pot odds for the call\n- Both opponents have folded, so it's just me vs the big blind\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: K2 offsuit is extremely weak. It has very little playability postflop.\n2. **Position**: Being on button is good, but doesn't save a terrible hand.\n3. **Opponent info**: The big blind (Seat 1) has been folding a lot, suggesting they might be tight. If they are tight, they might only call with decent hands.\n4. **Stack preservation**: With 74 BB, I should be selective with weak hands.\n5. **Recent success**: I did win with a similar K2 hand recently, but that was by raising preflop and getting folds.\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: This seems like the most sensible option given the hand strength\n\n\n- **Call**: With extremely poor playability and limited potential, calling would be a marginal decision at best\n- **Raise**: The weak kicker makes any aggressive move highly risky and unlikely to succeed\n\nI'll carefully evaluate the potential risks and minimal rewards of engaging with such a weak hand.\n",

So amount to call is 2 (to match BB? Actually we already posted 4, the SB posted 2, and we are BB. The amount to call is 2 meaning to call the SB's raise? Wait there was no raise, just SB posted 2, BB posted 4, and everyone else folded. So the pot is 6 chips, and we are already in with 4. The amount to call is 2 meaning we could check (no bet) because no one raised. In BB, after SB posts, BB posts, then action goes to SB first. But SB posted 2 and presumably can act? Actually preflop: Seat5 post_sb 2, Seat1 post_bb 4, then folds. Since only SB and BB, after blinds posted, action goes to SB first (Seat5) to act. The amount to call is 2 (the BB amount). So we can either fold (lose SB 2), call (match BB 4 total, i.e., put additional 2), or raise. Hand is weak, not worth raising. So we should call (i.e., check? Actually we are SB? Wait we are BB (Seat5). The amount to call is 2 (the difference between BB 4 and our SB 2). So to continue we need to call 2 more chips to match BB. So we can call. Decision: call. Reason: weak hand, no reason to raise, and we have decent stack 47BB, can see flop cheap.\n\nThus output JSON.",

Jacks on board, opponent could have J? They might have Jx, they'd have top pair. Our pair is weak. Better to check and see river.\n\nBut we could also consider raising as bluff to take pot. Opponent stack 104, pot 8, we could raise to maybe 8? Minimum raise is 4 (to total 4). Our stack 186. Opponent may fold many hands. Might be good to steal. However we have only Q4, not strong. But we are in BB, short stack? 46.5 BB, not short. Could check and see if we improve on river.\n\nGiven opponent checked flop, maybe they have weak. I'd lean to check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Wait board has 4c only one 4. We have 4d, so we have a pair of fours (pair). Actually board: 6h, Js, 4c, 2c, 3c. No other 4. So we have a pair of fours, queen kicker. Board also has a flush draw? There are three clubs on board: 4c,2c,3c. Our hand has Qs, not club. So possible opponent could have a flush (clubs) if they have two clubs. Also possible straight? Board: 2,3,4,6,J. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9? Not relevant. Straight draw maybe 5-6-7? Not. So board is relatively low.\n\nOpponent seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is the only opponent left. They are SB? Actually seat1 posted BB 4? Wait seat5 is BB. Seat1 posted SB 2? Actually preflop: seat5 post_sb 2 (so seat5 is small blind). seat1 post_bb 4 (big blind). So seat1 is BB, seat5 is SB. So on river, after turn both checked, we are in SB (first to act? Actually after turn check, on river seat5 is first to act? In order, action proceeds from SB then BB? On each street, the first to act is the player left of the button, but after flop the SB is first. Since both checked on turn, now river, SB acts first. So we have option to bet/raise.\n\nPot is 8 chips, we have 186 stack, deep. Opponent stack 104 chips. We can bet for value or check.\n\nOur hand: pair of fours, likely weak. Opponent could have many combos: maybe Jx, 6x, 2c3c flush draw? Actually flush possible if they have two clubs: any two clubs would make a flush (5 clubs). Board has three clubs: 4c 2c 3c. So any club in hand gives at least a flush? Actually need 5 clubs total. With 2 clubs in hand + 3 on board = 5 clubs, yes flush. So opponent could have a flush. Also could have a straight? Board: 2-3-4-6-J. Straight possible with A-5? Not. 5-6-7-8-9 no. So only possible straight is 2-3-4-5-6 (needs 5). If opponent has a 5, they'd have a straight 2-3-4-5-6. That's possible. So many hands beat us.\n\nOur hand likely worst. So checking is safe. Could we bluff? Opponent may check back with weak hand. But we have little equity. The pot is small, 8 chips. A bet of maybe 4-6 could steal? Opponent may call with any pair like J, 6, etc. But they might have missed clubs and be weak. However risk of being called by flush is high. Since tournament, preserve chips. So best to check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot check if we want to bet? Actually check is allowed. So we choose check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have hand: BB with 4d Qs. Board: 6h Js 4c 2c 3c. So we have pair of fours, top pair? Actually board has 4c, we have 4d, so we have a pair of fours with queen kicker. Board also has a flush draw? Board: clubs: 4c,2c,3c -> three clubs, plus we have no club. So flush possible for opponent if they have club. Straight possibilities: board 2-3-4-6-J, possible straight draws? 2-3-4-5-6 would be straight if someone has 5. We have no 5. Opponent could have 5x for straight. Also 6-7-8-9-10? No. J-high maybe.\n\nRiver bet of 6 into pot 14, so pot after bet = 20 (14+6). We need to call 6 to win 20, pot odds 6/20 = 30% needed.\n\nOur hand: pair of fours, likely weak. Opponent (Seat1) checked both preflop and flop and turn, then bets small on river. Could be a weak hand, maybe a missed draw, maybe a bluff, maybe a value bet with something like J, 6, maybe a pair of 6s, 3c? Actually board: 6h Js 4c 2c 3c. If opponent has Jx, they'd have top pair J. Might bet small. Could have 6, also pair. Could have 2c 3c for flush draw but missed; maybe they have a club for flush? No, there are 3 clubs on board, need 2 more clubs for flush, they could have two clubs, but they didn't bet earlier. Could be a bluff with missed club draw. Could also have Q? Q on board? No queen not present. So queen is high kicker.\n\nOur stack 186, opponent 98 chips. If we call, we risk 6 chips, small. If we raise, we could try to push them off. Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise total to 12). That would be raise of 6 extra (to 12). Opponent may call or fold. If they have weak hand they'd fold; if they have J they'd likely call? 6 chips call vs pot 14+6+? Actually after raise to 12, pot would be 14+12=26, they'd need to call 6 more. They have 98 chips, could call. Might be okay.\n\nGiven small bet, maybe we should call because pot odds good and we have some showdown value? But we are likely behind many hands. However we have queen kicker, could beat J? No, J beats us. So only hands we beat: lower pairs (2,3,6? Actually we have pair of 4s, we beat 2s,3s, maybe 6s? Wait we have 4s, board has 6, so 6s is higher pair. So we lose to 6s. We beat 2c 3c (two pair? Actually board has 2c and 3c, opponent could have 2c 3c for two pair? That would be 3c and 2c plus board 2c 3c 4c? Actually board has 2c 3c 4c, so if opponent holds 2c 3c they'd have full house? No board has only one each. So they'd have pair of 2s and 3s each? Not possible. So not relevant.\n\nWe beat any hand that is just high card, or lower pair like 2s,3s, maybe 6? No 6 higher. So limited.\n\nGiven small bet and pot odds, call seems okay. But consider tournament: we have 46.5 BB, opponent 98 chips (~24 BB). If we lose 6 chips, still fine. If we call and lose, we lose 6 chips, still fine. If we raise and they fold, we win 6 chips (pot 14+6? Actually we raise, they fold, we win pot 14). That's small gain. If they call, we risk 6 more chips, could lose more.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, best is to call the small bet, maybe even fold? But call seems okay given pot odds and we have some showdown value (pair). Also opponent's bet small could be a probe. I'd call.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null.\n\n",

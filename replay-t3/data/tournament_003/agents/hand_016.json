            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the data:\n\n1. **Opponent tendencies:**\n   - Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Very tight player. Folded 7 hands in a row preflop, then called once in hand 15 and folded on the flop. This is a very conservative player.\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Extremely tight. Has folded 9 out of 10 recent hands preflop. Only reached showdown once with JdQd.\n\n2. **My situation:**\n   - Position: BTN (best position)\n   - Hand: 9d Qh (Q9 offsuit) - marginal hand\n   - Stack: 221 chips (110.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - To call: 2 chips (1 BB)\n\n3. **Tournament considerations:**\n   - I have a healthy stack, no need to take unnecessary risks\n   - Both opponents are extremely tight, suggesting they're waiting for premium hands\n   - I'm on the button, which gives me position advantage\n\n4. **Hand analysis:**\n   - Q9 offsuit is not a strong hand, but it's playable from the button against tight players\n   - Against two very tight opponents who fold frequently, this is a good spot to steal the blinds\n   - The tight players are likely to fold unless they have premium holdings\n\nGiven that both opponents fold very frequently (especially DeepSeek-V3.2 who has folded 90% of recent hands), and I'm on the button with position advantage, this is a perfect spot for a steal attempt. A standard raise of 3x the big blind (6 chips) should be sufficient to take down the pot most of the time.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider the raise sizing. The minimum raise is to 4 chips (2x BB), but a 3x BB raise (6 chips) is more standard for a steal attempt and gives better fold equity.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: blinds are 1/2, so pot is 3 chips. A raise to 6 chips (3x BB) is standard. Let me raise to 6 chips total.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- My cards: 9d Qh - I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 10 to make a straight)\n- Stack: 215 chips (107.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Board: 5s Kc Js - There's a King and Jack on board\n- Pot: 18 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have Q9 with a board showing K-J-5. This gives me:\n- No pair\n- Gutshot straight draw (need a Ten to make a straight from 9-10-J-Q-K)\n- Backdoor flush draw (two diamonds, but board has one spade and two clubs)\n\n**Opponent Actions:**\n- Preflop: I raised to 6, both opponents called\n- Flop: Both opponents checked to me\n\nThis is a good situation for a continuation bet (c-bet). Let me think about what my opponents might have:\n\n**Opponent Ranges:**\nGiven they called preflop from SB and BB:\n- SB (Seat 2): Could have broadway cards, suited connectors, pocket pairs, etc.\n- BB (Seat 3): Could have a wide range since they got good odds to call\n\nThe K-J board hits a lot of calling ranges. However, the fact that both checked to me suggests weakness. They could have:\n- Hands that missed completely\n- Weak pairs (like 5x, maybe Jx)\n- Draws\n- Strong hands slowplaying (less likely with two players)\n\n**My Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card, see if I hit my gutshot. But this gives up initiative and allows opponents to realize equity for free.\n2. **Raise (c-bet)**: Apply pressure, take down the pot now, or build pot if I hit my draw.\n \nWith a gutshot draw and two opponents, checking seems like the most prudent move. The limited outs (only 4 Tens) and potential for opponents to have strong hands make a continuation bet risky. Checking allows me to see the next card without investing more chips, preserving my stack and avoiding unnecessary confrontation.\n\nI'll carefully consider the potential risks of betting against two opponents on this board texture. The presence of high cards like King and Jack means opponents could easily have connected hands. Checking provides a strategic way to control the pot size and manage my chip stack effectively.\n\nMy position on the button gives me flexibility, and the free card option looks most attractive with my current drawing hand. I'll take the conservative approach and check, maintaining my strategic options for future streets.",

They only played hands #1, #2, and #3. In hand #1 they folded on the turn. In hand #2 they raised preflop big (18 chips). In hand #3 they saw showdown after calling down.\n\nThe fact that this tight player is now betting on the turn after everyone checked the flop suggests they likely have a strong hand. They could have:\n- A King (Kx)\n- A Jack (Jx)\n- A flush draw with clubs\n- A straight draw (QT)\n- Two pair or a set\n\n**My equity**: With just a gutshot straight draw (need a 10), I have approximately 4 outs (four 10s in the deck), which is about 8.7% equity on the turn. This is not enough to call 14 chips into a 32 chip pot.\n\nEven if I factor in implied odds, it's unlikely I'll get paid off enough if I hit my gutshot, especially against a tight player who likely has a strong hand.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. I don't have the pot odds to chase this gutshot, and I'm against a tight player who is showing strength. \n\nThe pot odds are 2.3:1, but my draw needs roughly 10:1 to be profitable. My stack of 215 chips is deep enough to wait for better spots. The opponent's tight betting pattern indicates genuine strength, making a call or raise unwise with my weak draw.",

Actually 9-8 needs 7 or T for straight, but with 5-K-J board, I have a gutshot to a Q-T-9-8-7 straight? Wait, let me think: I have 9-8, board is 5-K-J. I need a 7 for 5-7-8-9 straight or a T for 8-9-T-J straight. Actually 8-9-T-J would be a straight, so I need a T. That's a gutshot straight draw (4 outs).\n- I also have a backdoor flush draw with clubs (I have 9c 8c, board has Kc, so I need two more clubs)\n- Very weak made hand - only 9-high\n\nOpponent tendencies from memory:\nSeat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has raised preflop twice (hands 10 and 13), folded most other times. Seems selective.\nSeat 2 (Kimi-K2): Called preflop in hand 15, then folded on flop. Mostly folds preflop.\n\nPot odds: Pot is 18 chips. If I check, likely Seat 1 (preflop raiser) will bet. If he bets, I'll need to consider pot odds.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 89.5 BB, which is healthy. No need to take big risks with weak draws.\n\nDecision: I should check. Reasons:\n1. My hand is very weak - only 9-high with a gutshot draw\n2. I'm out of position against the preflop raiser\n3. Checking allows me to see what Seat 1 does\n4. If Seat 1 bets and Seat 2 folds, I can evaluate pot odds for my draw\n5. Raising with this weak hand would be spewy - I could get raised by Seat 1 who likely has a strong hand (Kx, JJ, etc.)\n6. I have position relative to Seat 2, but Seat 1 acts after me\n\nActually wait - the action order: Seat 2 checked, I act, then Seat 1 acts. So if I check, Seat 1 can bet. If I raise, I'm putting money in with a weak hand.\n\nBetter to check and see what happens. If Seat 1 checks behind, I get a free turn card. If he bets, I can evaluate.\n\nLet me check.",

Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking (215 chips) - Preflop raiser, checked flop\n2. Seat 2: Kimi-K2 (184 chips) - Called preflop, checked flop and turn\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- We have a flush draw (club flush draw)\n- Straight draw possibilities: We need a 7 for a gutshot straight (7 gives us 9-8-7-6-5)\n- Actually, we have an open-ended straight draw if a 7 comes (7 gives us 9-8-7-6-5) OR if a T comes (T gives us J-T-9-8-7)\n- But board has K and J, so our straight would be to the 9-high straight if we hit 7 or T\n- We also have backdoor straight possibilities\n- Current hand: 9-high with flush draw\n\n**Position:** We're last to act on the turn. Both opponents checked to us.\n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 18 chips. If we bet, we can get value from worse hands or fold out better hands. We have good implied odds if we hit our flush or straight on river.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the data:\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1): Has shown aggression with a turn bet in hand #7. Has raised preflop multiple times (hands 10, 13). Checked flop this hand.\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2): Mostly folds preflop, but called preflop this hand and hand #15. Seems passive.\n\n**Decision:**\nWe have a flush draw with 9 outs (9 clubs remaining). Plus some straight outs (7s and Ts that aren't clubs - about 6 more outs). Total ~15 outs, which is about 30% equity.\n\nWith both players checking to us, we have a good opportunity to take the pot down now with a bet. If we get called, we still have good equity to improve on river.\n\nGiven pot is 18 chips, a reasonable bet would be around 12-15 chips (2/3 to 3/4 pot). Minimum raise is 4 chips, but that's too small - would give opponents good odds to call.\n\nBetter to bet around 12-14 chips. Let's go with 14 chips.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 14,\n  \"reasoning\": \"We have a flush draw with 9 outs plus additional straight outs (~15 outs total, ~30% equity).

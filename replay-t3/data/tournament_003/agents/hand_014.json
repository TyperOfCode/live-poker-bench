When they do call, they often bet on flop (seen in hand 8). Seems like a tight-passive player.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Also mostly folding preflop (folded 6/9 times), but when they enter pots, they can be aggressive (bet 4 on flop in hand 9). The raise from SB suggests strength.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- J2o is a very weak hand, even with a diamond (not suited)\n- I'm out of position as BB\n- Facing a raise from SB who has been relatively tight\n- Pot odds: 6 to win 18 (12+6) = 3:1 or 25% equity needed\n- J2o has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. J2o is one of the worst hands in poker, I'm out of position, facing aggression from a player who appears tight, and I have no implied odds. Even with good pot odds, my hand is just too weak to continue.\n\nI should fold.",

I've been folding a lot (10/13 hands folded preflop)\n2. My win rate is low (15.4%)\n3. Opponents:\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has raised preflop twice (hand #1 and #7)\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) hasn't raised preflop that I saw\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has raised preflop in hand #10 and #13\n\n**Analysis:**\n- Tc9s is a weak hand from UTG\n- With 4 players left to act behind me (Seat 4, Seat 5, Seat 1, Seat 2 folded)\n- In early position with a marginal hand, standard play is to fold\n- Calling 2 chips (1 BB) would set up a multi-way pot with a weak hand\n- Raising would be spewy with this hand from UTG\n- The pot odds are 3:2 (pot is 3, call is 2), but implied odds aren't great with this hand\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- My stack is healthy (92.5 BB)\n- No need to take unnecessary risks with weak hands\n- Better to wait for better spots, especially from better position\n\n**Decision:** Fold. This is a clear fold from UTG with Tc9s. The hand is too weak to play from early position, especially with multiple players left to act. I should preserve my chips and wait for a better spot.",

This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the BTN (Button), which is the best position post-flop, but we're still preflop.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Blinds are 2/4\n- Pot is 18 chips\n- I need to call 8 chips (to match the raise from 4 to 12)\n- Minimum raise to 20\n- My stack: 112 chips (28 BB)\n\n**Opponent analysis**: The player in Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 12. Looking at their recent actions:\n- They raised in hand #32 (we don't know the outcome)\n- They folded in hands #33, #34, #36, #38\n- They checked and folded in hand #35\n- They raised in hand #37 then folded\n\nThis suggests they raise with some hands but also fold frequently. However, with my weak 3-4 offsuit, I should be very cautious.\n\n**Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips to win a pot of 18 chips. That's 8/18 = 44% pot odds. With 3-4 offsuit, I don't have anywhere near that equity against a raising range.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: I have 28 BB, which is a decent stack. I shouldn't risk chips with such a weak hand. The raise amount is small (3x BB), but my hand is terrible.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. This is an easy fold with 3-4 offsuit facing a raise. I don't have the pot odds, hand strength, or any reason to call or raise here.",

In hand 32, they raised to 12 preflop. In hand 37, they also raised to 12 preflop. This suggests they're using a standard 3x raise size.\n\nLooking at my recent hands, I won hand 37 with KQs from SB by raising to 30. That was a much stronger hand.\n\nWith Q6o, this is a marginal hand at best. In cutoff position, I would normally consider playing some speculative hands, but Q6o is quite weak. It's offsuit, has no straight potential unless we hit exactly 7-8-9-T or something, and even if we hit a pair, we'll often be dominated by better queens.\n\nThe raise is from early position (seat 2 is UTG+1 or MP depending on table size). This means the raiser likely has a stronger range than if they were on the button.\n\nPot odds: Need to call 12 to win 30 (18 pot + 12 from me). That's 2.5:1 odds, or 29% equity needed. Q6o likely has less than 29% equity against a typical UTG+1 raising range.\n\nTournament considerations: I have a healthy stack of 51 BB. No need to take marginal spots.

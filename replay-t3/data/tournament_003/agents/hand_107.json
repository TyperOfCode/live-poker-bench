Their current all-in raise from SB suggests strength.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm very short-stacked at 6.8 BB\n- The pot is already 482 chips, and I need to call 354 to potentially win 836 (pot + my call)\n- This gives me pot odds of 354/(354+482) = 354/836 = 42.3%\n- Even with 36, I only have about 32% equity against a random hand\n- Against any reasonable raising range, I'm crushed\n- This is a clear fold - I need to preserve my 434 chips for a better spot\n\n**Decision: Fold**",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the BTN (button) with 5d Td (suited)\n- My stack: 418 chips (6.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 96 chips (SB 32 + BB 64)\n- Amount to call: 32 (to complete SB)\n- Only opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking in the BB with 434 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- 5d Td is a marginal hand, but suited connectors have some potential\n- At 6.5 BB stack, I'm in push/fold territory\n- Position is excellent (button)\n- Only one opponent in the BB\n\n**Opponent analysis from recall:**\n- Kimi-K2 Thinking has been fairly tight preflop\n- In hand #101, they raised to 256 (4x BB) preflop\n- In hand #106, they called from BB then folded\n- They've folded several times preflop\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- With 6.5 BB, I need to accumulate chips soon\n- Folding leaves me with 386 chips (6 BB) - still critical\n- Calling 32 (now 7.5% of my stack) to see a flop with a speculative hand might be OK\n\n**Tournament implications:**\n- I'm very short-stacked and need to find spots\n- Button vs BB is a good spot to apply pressure\n- The BB might fold to a shove given their tight tendencies\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- If I call 32, pot becomes 128, I have 386 behind (effective stacks)\n- If I shove (raise to 418), I risk my tournament life but could win 96 chips uncontested\n\n**Decision:**\nGiven my stack size (6.5 BB), I should be shoving a wide range here. 5d Td suited is actually not terrible for a shove - it has some equity against a random hand. The BB has shown some tightness, so they might fold. Even if called, I have ~40% equity against many calling ranges.\n\nFolding leaves me with 6 BB, which is still playable but getting desperate. Calling to see a flop commits 7.5% of my stack with a speculative hand, which might be worse than shoving.\n\nI think the optimal play is to shove all-in. This puts maximum pressure on the BB, and with my stack size, I need to accumulate chips.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 418,\n  \"reasoning\": \"At 6.5 BB stack, I'm in push/fold territory. Shoving 5d Td suited from button vs BB applies maximum pressure. Opponent has shown tight tendencies preflop and may fold. Even if called, I have reasonable equity. Folding leaves me critically short at 6 BB. Need to accumulate chips to survive tournament.\"\n}",

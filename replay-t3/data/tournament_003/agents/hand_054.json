Minimum raise to 16.\n\nObservations from opponent history:\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, BB): Has folded preflop 10 times in a row. Seems very tight.\n2. MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, CO? Actually seat 4 is after me, so likely MP): Has raised preflop in hands 49 and 50 (both to 16), but folded the last 3 hands. Somewhat aggressive when playing.\n3. GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, SB): Folded preflop last 8 hands in a row. Very tight.\n\nMy position is UTG, which is the worst position. KJo is a marginal hand from UTG. Standard play would be to fold or raise, but not call. Calling invites others to come in and puts me in a tough spot postflop.\n\nMy stack is 20.5 BB, which is getting short. I need to accumulate chips soon. However, KJo from UTG with tight players behind is risky.\n\nLooking at my recent history: I've been folding a lot (40 folds out of 53 hands). I won hand #48 with T9o from BTN after calling a raise and betting flop. My win rate is 20.75%.\n\nGiven the opponents' tendencies:\n- BB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding constantly\n- Players behind me: MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression but folded recently, GPT-OSS-120B has been folding\n\nIf I raise, I might get folds from the tight players. But if I get called or raised, I'm in a tough spot with KJo out of position.\n\nConsidering tournament stage and stack size: 20.5 BB is getting critical. I need to find spots to accumulate. However, UTG with KJo might not be the best spot.\n\nLet me think about ranges: From UTG with 20.5 BB, I should be playing tight. KJo is borderline. I could raise to 16-20 chips (2-2.5x) and hope to take it down preflop. If called, I need to be cautious.\n\nAlternative is to fold and wait for a better spot. Given the tight table, I might get better opportunities.\n\nLet me check if there are any other observations... Looking at MiniMax-M2's raises: both were to 16 chips (2x BB). So if I raise, I should probably raise to 16-20.\n\nDecision: I think I should fold. KJo from UTG with 20.5 BB is too marginal. I have position disadvantage and could easily be dominated by AK, AQ, KQ, AA, KK, QQ, JJ. The tight players behind might wake up with strong hands. Better to wait for a better spot in better position.\n\nBut wait, the table is very tight. Maybe I can raise and steal the blinds? Let me reconsider: BB has folded 10 straight hands. SB has folded 8 straight. They might continue folding. However, MiniMax-M2 in MP might call or raise with a decent hand.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: Seat 2 folded already. So action is on me UTG, with SB (seat 5) and BB (seat 1) left to act, then seats 4 and 5 again? Wait, seat order: Seat 1 (BB), Seat 2 (folded), Seat 3 (me UTG), Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2), Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B SB). Actually SB already posted. So after me, only Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) and Seat 1 (BB) act.\n\nGiven BB's extreme tightness and MiniMax-M2's recent folds, a raise might work. But if MiniMax-M2 calls or raises, I'm in trouble.\n\nI think the conservative play is fold. With my stack size, I need to pick better spots. KJo from UTG is a fold in most tournament strategies.\n\nLet me do a quick equity calculation: KJo vs random hand has ~60% equity. But vs calling ranges of opponents, it's worse.\n\nI'll fold."

Minimum raise to 16.\n\nObservations from opponent history:\n1. Kimi-K2 Thinking (seat 1, BB): Has folded preflop 10 times in a row. Seems very tight.\n2. MiniMax-M2 (seat 4, CO? Actually seat 4 is after me, so likely MP): Has raised preflop in hands 49 and 50 (both to 16), but folded the last 3 hands. Somewhat aggressive when playing.\n3. GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5, SB): Folded preflop last 8 hands in a row. Very tight.\n\nMy position is UTG, which is the worst position. KJo is a marginal hand from UTG. Standard play would be to fold or raise, but not call. Calling invites others to come in and puts me in a tough spot postflop.\n\nMy stack is 20.5 BB, which is getting short. I need to accumulate chips soon. However, KJo from UTG with tight players behind is risky.\n\nLooking at my recent history: I've been folding a lot (40 folds out of 53 hands). I won hand #48 with T9o from BTN after calling a raise and betting flop. My win rate is 20.75%.\n\nGiven the opponents' tendencies:\n- BB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding constantly\n- Players behind me: MiniMax-M2 has shown some aggression but folded recently, GPT-OSS-120B has been folding\n\nIf I raise, I might get folds from the tight players. But if I get called or raised, I'm in a tough spot with KJo out of position.\n\nConsidering tournament stage and stack size: 20.5 BB is getting critical. I need to find spots to accumulate. However, UTG with KJo might not be the best spot.\n\nLet me think about ranges: From UTG with 20.5 BB, I should be playing tight. KJo is borderline. I could raise to 16-20 chips (2-2.5x) and hope to take it down preflop. If called, I need to be cautious.\n\nAlternative is to fold and wait for a better spot. Given the tight table, I might get better opportunities.\n\nLet me check if there are any other observations... Looking at MiniMax-M2's raises: both were to 16 chips (2x BB). So if I raise, I should probably raise to 16-20.\n\nDecision: I think I should fold. KJo from UTG with 20.5 BB is too marginal. I have position disadvantage and could easily be dominated by AK, AQ, KQ, AA, KK, QQ, JJ. The tight players behind might wake up with strong hands. Better to wait for a better spot in better position.\n\nBut wait, the table is very tight. Maybe I can raise and steal the blinds? Let me reconsider: BB has folded 10 straight hands. SB has folded 8 straight. They might continue folding. However, MiniMax-M2 in MP might call or raise with a decent hand.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: Seat 2 folded already. So action is on me UTG, with SB (seat 5) and BB (seat 1) left to act, then seats 4 and 5 again? Wait, seat order: Seat 1 (BB), Seat 2 (folded), Seat 3 (me UTG), Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2), Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B SB). Actually SB already posted. So after me, only Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) and Seat 1 (BB) act.\n\nGiven BB's extreme tightness and MiniMax-M2's recent folds, a raise might work. But if MiniMax-M2 calls or raises, I'm in trouble.\n\nI think the conservative play is fold. With my stack size, I need to pick better spots. KJo from UTG is a fold in most tournament strategies.\n\nLet me do a quick equity calculation: KJo vs random hand has ~60% equity. But vs calling ranges of opponents, it's worse.\n\nI'll fold.",

This hand would need to hit very specific board combinations to win.\n\nThis is clearly a fold situation. Even from the button position, 3s-Th is too weak to play profitably against active opponents.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"3s-Th is a very weak hand with minimal equity.

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My Hand**: 3s Th - This is a very weak hand. It's suited connectors but very low, with no straight potential (3-4-5-6-7 would need specific cards), and very little flush potential since I'm only one suited card.\n\n2. **Position**: BTN (Button) - This is a good position as I get to act last preflop.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 381 chips (47.6 BB) - I'm in a decent stack position, not short stacked but not a big stack either.\n\n4. **Current Situation**: \n   - I need to call 8 chips to see the flop\n   - The minimum raise would be to 16 chips total\n   - Two players have already folded (Seats 2 and 3)\n   - Only Seat 5 (small blind) and Seat 1 (big blind) remain in the hand\n\n5. **Opponent Analysis**:\n   - From my recall, I can see that Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been quite active with raises in recent hands (raised 20 and 24 chips in the last two hands)\n   - But Seat 2 has already folded this hand\n   - Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been folding frequently in recent hands\n   - Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has been folding frequently as well\n\n6. **My Historical Performance from Button**:\n   - I've played 10 hands from the button recently\n   - My win rate is about 24.5% from button position\n   - I've been folding quite a bit (7 out of 10 hands)\n   - When I do play, I tend to call rather than raise with marginal hands\n   - I won with 6s-7h and 4s-9s recently, both were calls that turned into bets on favorable boards\n\n7. **Hand Strength Analysis**:\n   - 3s-Th is very weak preflop\n   - No high cards, very low connectivity\n   - Limited straight and flush potential\n   - This is clearly a fold preflop in most situations\n\n8. **Tournament Considerations**:\n   - I'm at 47.6 BB, which is a healthy stack size\n   - No need to take unnecessary risks with such a weak hand\n   - Better to wait for better opportunities\n\nGiven the extremely weak nature of 3s-Th and the fact that I'm getting decent value from folding (preserving my stack for better opportunities), this should be a clear fold preflop. Even though I'm in position, the hand has virtually no equity and would require hitting very specific board combinations to win.\n\nThe cost to call is 8 chips, but the risk-reward doesn't justify it with such a weak holding. I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n",

Wait seat1 posted SB 4, seat5 posted BB 8. Actually seat1 is SB, seat5 is BB. So preflop actions: seat5 post SB 4? Wait they wrote \"Seat 5 post_sb 4\" meaning seat5 posted small blind? But seat5 is BB seat? Actually they may have misordered: seat5 is our seat, they posted sb 4 (so we are SB?) But earlier they said Position: BB (Seat5). In many tables, seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB. But the actions show seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So maybe seats are rotated? Anyway we are the small blind? Let's parse: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So we are BB. The actions: seat5 post_sb 4 (contradiction). Could be a mistake; maybe they reversed. But we have to assume we are BB with 8 blind posted. The amount to call is 4, meaning the SB (seat5) posted 4, BB (seat1) posted 8. So we are SB? Actually amount to call is 4, meaning we need to call the BB's 8? Wait we have posted SB 4, then seat1 posted BB 8. So to call we need to put in 4 more to match BB (8). So amount to call = 4. Yes that matches: we posted 4, need to call 4 to match 8. So we are SB, not BB. But they said Position BB. Might be a mistake. Regardless, we are first to act preflop after the BB? Actually after blinds, action goes to UTG etc., but all others folded, so the SB acts first, then BB. Since only SB and BB are left, SB acts first. So we need to decide to call 4, raise to at least 16 (total). Hand 7h8c is suited? No it's off-suit: hearts and clubs, not suited. 7-8 offsuit is a marginal hand in SB vs BB. With 15.5 BB effective stack, we could consider raising to steal BB? But only opponent is BB (seat1). He has 194 chips, bigger stack. In SB vs BB, raising is standard. 7-8 offsuit is not a strong raise, but could be used as a steal if opponent folds. However opponent may defend wide. But given he's the BB, they might defend a wide range. But we have only 4 to call, small amount. Could also just call and see flop. But 7-8 offsuit is a speculative hand; calling cheap is okay to see flop, but we will be out of position post-flop (since BB acts first). However we have stack 124, not huge. Might be okay to call and see flop cheap. If flop hits, we could have straight draws.\n\nConsider pot odds: pot currently 12, call 4 => pot will be 16, we invest 4 for 16 pot => 25% equity needed. 7-8 offsuit vs unknown BB range (maybe 30% of hands) has maybe ~12% equity, not enough. So call is not profitable unless we expect to hit later.\n\nRaising: Minimum raise to 16 total (i.e., raise additional 8). So raise to 16 (total). That would be a raise of 8 extra beyond call (i.e., total 16). That would be 8 more than call? Actually call is 4, raise total 16 means additional 12. So we would be raising 8? Wait we have already posted 4, need to put total 16, so additional 12. That's a raise of 12. That's 3x the BB. This could pressure BB. But 7-8 offsuit is weak to raise; might be a bluff. Could be okay.\n\nGiven we have 15.5 BB, we could try to steal the BB's blind, but the BB may just call. If they call, we will be out of position with a weak hand.\n\nI think best is to fold? But folding a 7-8 offsuit in SB vs BB when only two players left seems wasteful because we already invested 4. But we can just call cheap and see flop; it's not a huge loss. Expectation? With 7-8 offsuit, we have about 12% equity vs random BB range (maybe 25% of hands). Not enough for a call. But we could also raise as a bluff: if BB"

With 15.5 BB effective stack, we could consider raising to steal BB? But only opponent is BB (seat1). He has 194 chips, bigger stack. In SB vs BB, raising is standard. 7-8 offsuit is not a strong raise, but could be used as a steal if opponent folds. However opponent may defend wide. But given he's the BB, they might defend a wide range. But we have only 4 to call, small amount. Could also just call and see flop. But 7-8 offsuit is a speculative hand; calling cheap is okay to see flop, but we will be out of position post-flop (since BB acts first). However we have stack 124, not huge. Might be okay to call and see flop cheap. If flop hits, we could have straight draws.\n\nConsider pot odds: pot currently 12, call 4 => pot will be 16, we invest 4 for 16 pot => 25% equity needed. 7-8 offsuit vs unknown BB range (maybe 30% of hands) has maybe ~12% equity, not enough. So call is not profitable unless we expect to hit later.\n\nRaising: Minimum raise to 16 total (i.e., raise additional 8). So raise to 16 (total). That would be a raise of 8 extra beyond call (i.e., total 16). That would be 8 more than call? Actually call is 4, raise total 16 means additional 12. So we would be raising 8? Wait we have already posted 4, need to put total 16, so additional 12. That's a raise of 12. That's 3x the BB. This could pressure BB. But 7-8 offsuit is weak to raise; might be a bluff. Could be okay.\n\nGiven we have 15.5 BB, we could try to steal the BB's blind, but the BB may just call. If they call, we will be out of position with a weak hand.\n\nI think best is to fold? But folding a 7-8 offsuit in SB vs BB when only two players left seems wasteful because we already invested 4. But we can just call cheap and see flop; it's not a huge loss. Expectation? With 7-8 offsuit, we have about 12% equity vs random BB range (maybe 25% of hands). Not enough for a call. But we could also raise as a bluff: if BB",

This keeps the pot small and allows me to use my positional advantage postflop.\n\nHowever, I could also consider a **raise** to 15-18 chips to:\n1. Isolate the raiser\n2. Take control of the hand\n3. Potentially win preflop if they're weak\n\nBut given the opponent's tight raising pattern, a call seems safer. Let me go with the call to see the flop in position.",

There are 4 tens in the deck.\n  - Total outs = 8 spades + 4 tens = 12 outs, but the Ts is counted twice, so 11 unique outs\n- Wait, let's do this properly:\n  - Total cards: 52\n  - Known cards: 2 in our hand + 3 on board = 5 cards\n  - Unknown cards: 47\n  - Spades: 13 total. We know Qs, 9s, Ks, Js = 4 spades accounted for. So 9 spades remaining.\n  - Tens: 4 total. None on board or in our hand. So 4 tens remaining.\n  - Ts is in both categories, so total outs = 9 + 4 - 1 = 12 outs\n- Actually, the Ts is just one card that serves both purposes.

When they did enter the pot (Hand 1), they played aggressively postflop.\n\nIn the current hand (Hand 7), they raised preflop to 6, and now bet 4 on the flop into a 19 chip pot. This is a small bet (21% pot).\n\n**My hand:** Js Ks - I have a strong combo draw:\n- Flush draw (King-high)\n- Gutshot straight draw (need a Ten)\n- Backdoor straight possibilities\n\n**Pot odds:** 4 to call into 23 total = 17.4% needed equity\n**My equity:** ~12 outs = ~24% on the turn, ~48% by river\n\nEven against a strong hand like top pair, I have good equity. The opponent's small bet suggests either:\n1. Weak hand trying to see where they stand\n2. Strong hand trying to extract value\n3. Drawing hand themselves\n\nGiven their tight preflop play but aggressive postflop in Hand 1, I should raise here to:\n1. Build the pot when I have strong equity\n2. Charge them for drawing\n3. Potentially take it down now\n4. Gain initiative\n\nI should raise to about 14-16 chips (roughly 3-4x their bet). Let's make it 15 total.",

            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Current Hand Situation:**\n- My position: BTN (Button)\n- My cards: Js Ks (King-Jack suited, spades)\n- My stack: 176 chips (88 BB)\n- Board: Qs 9s 8h 2d\n- Pot: 45 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have a flush draw (spades) with Ks Js\n- I have an open-ended straight draw (any Ten gives me a straight)\n- I have two overcards (K and J)\n- This gives me a very strong drawing hand with many outs\n\n**Outs calculation:**\n- Flush draw: 9 spades remaining (13 total - 4 on board/in hand)\n- Straight draw: 4 Tens (but Ts is already counted in flush draw, so 3 additional)\n- Overcards: 3 Kings + 3 Jacks = 6 outs (but some may be blocked by flush/straight cards)\n- Total clean outs: ~15 outs (9 flush + 3 straight + some overcard outs)\n\nThis is approximately a 30-32% chance to hit on the river.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 45 chips\n- To call: 0 (opponent checked)\n- If I bet, minimum raise is to 11\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n- Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n  - Hand 1: Raised preflop, bet flop and turn, folded to turn bet\n  - Hand 2: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 3: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 4: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 5: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 6: Folded preflop\n\nGPT-OSS-120B seems to be playing tight but also betting when they have initiative. They raised preflop to 6, bet 4 on flop, called my raise to 15, and now checked on turn.\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Preflop: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 6, I called\n- Flop: GPT-OSS-120B bet 4, I raised to 15, they called\n- Turn: They checked\n\nThe check on turn after calling my flop raise suggests they might be:\n1. Weak and giving up\n2. Pot-controlling with a marginal hand\n3. Setting a trap with a strong hand\n\nGiven the board texture Qs 9s 8h 2d, possible hands they could have:\n- Made hands: Qx, 9x, 8x, 22, 99, QQ\n- Draws: Spade flush draws, straight draws (JT, T7, 76)\n- Air: Various hands that missed\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check: See a free river card with my strong draw\n2. Bet: Build the pot when I hit, fold out some better hands, charge draws\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 88 BB\n- Pot is already 45 chips\n- Building the pot now could win me a big pot if I hit\n\n**Decision:**\nWith such a strong draw (flush + straight + overcards), I should bet for value and to build the pot. Checking would give a free card but I'd miss value when I hit. \n\nSince opponent checked, I can make a value bet with my draw. A bet of around 20-25 chips (half pot) would be appropriate to:\n- Charge draws\n- Build pot for when I hit\n- Potentially fold out marginal hands\n\nMinimum raise is 11, but I should bet more than that. Let me bet 22 chips (roughly half pot).",

Actually amount to call is 2, minimum raise to 4 means total bet 4). So raise to 4 is 2 raise over call, which is 2 BB. That's a small raise. Usually we raise 3x BB = 6. But legal actions: raise to at least 4. Could raise bigger if we want. Consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 sometimes raises preflop to 6 (observed). MiniMax-M2 hasn't raised preflop (no data). DeepSeek-V3.2 unknown. Our stack is deep, 102 BB, can afford standard raise.\n\nTdKd suited is a premium hand, good for 3-betting. In UTG, we can open raise to 5-6 chips (2.5-3 BB). The pot is 3 chips currently (SB 1, BB 2). Raising to 6 would be 3x BB, total bet 6, so raise amount 4 (since call 2). That's allowed? Minimum raise to 4, but can raise higher.

Actually amount to call is 2, minimum raise to 4 means total bet 4). So raise to 4 is 2 raise over call, which is 2 BB. That's a small raise. Usually we raise 3x BB = 6. But legal actions: raise to at least 4. Could raise bigger if we want. Consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 sometimes raises preflop to 6 (observed). MiniMax-M2 hasn't raised preflop (no data). DeepSeek-V3.2 unknown. Our stack is deep, 102 BB, can afford standard raise.\n\nTdKd suited is a premium hand, good for 3-betting. In UTG, we can open raise to 5-6 chips (2.5-3 BB). The pot is 3 chips currently (SB 1, BB 2). Raising to 6 would be 3x BB, total bet 6, so raise amount 4 (since call 2). That's allowed? Minimum raise to 4, but can raise higher. So raise to 6 is okay.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: not given, but stack 102 BB, deep stack, can be aggressive.\n\nThus I will raise to 6.

Actually we bet 4, then they raised to 15 (so they put in 15 total, meaning they added 11). Amount to call is 11. Minimum raise to 26 (so raise must be to at least 26 total). We have stack 194. Need decision.\n\nWe need to consider hand strength: KdTd gives us open-ended straight draw? Board Qs 9s 8h. We have Ten and King. Straight possibilities: 7-6? Actually we have 10, board 9,8, Q. With K, we have gutshot? Let's see combos: Straight draws: With KdTd, we have a gutshot to a straight: need J to make Q-J-10-9-8? Actually Q- J -10-9-8 would be straight, need J. Also need A for broadway? A Q J 10 9? No we have K not J. So only possible straight is J. Also we have a backdoor flush draw? Suits: board has two spades (Qs, 9s). Our hand has no spade, so no flush draw.\n\nWe have top pair? No Q is on board, we have K and T, no pair. We have overcards: K and T, K is over Q, T is middle.\n\nOpponent raised on flop after our bet. Could be they have Qx, maybe a set (QQ?), but board has Qs only one queen. Could be they have 9s for set? Actually board has 9s, we have no 9. So they could have 99 for set, or 88 for set, or Q? Actually Qs is on board, there is only one queen. They could have Qx for two pair? Not possible because only one queen on board. They could have straight draw like J10, or A K for gutshot? Actually they could have KJ, J9, etc.\n\nWe need to evaluate equity. Our hand: KdTd. Against unknown range, but opponent raised after our bet, maybe they have strong hand or strong draw. Our bet of 4 was small pot bet (pot 34). Opponent raises to 15 (about 3x). That could be a continuation raise with a made hand or a draw.\n\nWe have 11 to call, pot currently 34 + 4 + 15 = 53? Actually pot before opponent's raise: 34 (preflop) + our 4 = 38. Then opponent raises to 15, adding 11 more (since they already called 4? Actually they raise to 15 total, meaning they put in 15, so net addition 11). So pot after raise = 38 + 15 = 53. If we call 11, pot would be 64, we invest 11 for 53? Actually effective pot after call = 53 + 11 = 64. So pot odds: need to call 11 to win 64, about 17% required. So we need equity > 17% to be profitable.\n\nOur hand vs opponent's possible range: likely they have Qx, 99, 88, maybe J10, KJ, etc. Let's approximate: If they have Qx (top pair), they have advantage. If they have a set, we are dead. If they have straight draw J10, they have also a pair? Actually J10 would give them a gutshot (needs J). They have 10, we also have 10, but they could have J10. That would give them pair of tens plus gutshot? Actually board: Q 9 8, they have J10 => they have pair of tens, same as us, but they have J kicker, we have K kicker, we are ahead. But they'd have a gutshot to straight as well. So they might raise with pair, draws, etc.\n\nOur equity maybe around 30% vs a wide range? Hard to know. Also tournament considerations: stack 97 BB, still deep. Should we call? Might be okay.\n\nWe can also consider raising. Minimum raise to 26, which would be a raise of 26 total (so add 12 more beyond call). That would be a pot raise. That could be a semi-bluff if we have backdoor draws? Not much.\n\nBetter to call and see turn? Could be okay.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: we attempted recall but no data. So assume typical.\n\nThus I think call is appropriate.\n\nReturn JSON."

Let's reconstruct: Preflop we raised to 6 (BB raise). Opponent called 6. Flop: we bet 4 (small). Opponent raised to 15 (so 11 more). We called 11. So pot after flop call: initial pot 45? Actually given pot 45 at turn start. So after flop actions, pot is 45.\n\nNow turn card is? Not given yet; we are at turn decision, board currently Qs 9s 8h 2d, turn unknown yet? Actually board shows Qs 9s 8h 2d (that's 4 cards). So turn is 2d. So we have TdKd, board: Qs 9s 8h 2d. Our hand: Ten of diamonds and King of diamonds. We have a gutshot? Let's see possible draws: Straight draws: we have K, T. Board: Q,9,8,2. We have K and T, so possible straight combos: 10-J-Q-K? Actually we have T, board Q,9,8: we have open-ended? Let's list: 8-9-10-J-Q would be a straight if we had J. We have T, need J. So we have gutshot to straight (need J). Also we have K high, no pair. So currently we have just King high, no pair, no flush (two diamonds, board has no diamond). So we are likely behind.\n\nOpponent's range: He called preflop, then raised on flop after our small bet. He likely has strong hand: maybe top pair Q, or a set (9s?), but board has Qs 9s 8h. He raised to 15 (big). Could be a queen, a straight draw (J10), a two pair (Q9), a set (9s?), but set of 9s is impossible because board has 9s, we have no 9. Actually board has 9s, we could have 9x but not. Opp could have 9x for set? Actually set would be 9?? board has one 9, need two 9s in hand. He could have 9? He could have 9? He could have 9? Actually there is 9s on board, there are three 9s in deck. He could have two 9s, giving set. That's possible. He could also have Q? top pair. He could have straight draws like J10, or 7-6 for open-ended? Board 8-9-Q, a 7-6 gives 6-7-8-9-Q not straight. So not.\n\nOur hand is weak. Turn is 2d. Does that change? Not much.\n\nWe have 183 chips, opponent Kimi-K2 has 176 chips. Both similar stacks. Pot 45. Opp hasn't acted yet on turn. It's our action after opponent's turn? Actually order: On turn, seat 5 (us) is first? The order: BB is seat5, seat1 is UTG? Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2. On flop, we bet first, then seat1 raised, then we called. So on turn, seat5 (us) is first to act because seat1 is left of us? Actually order is clockwise from dealer. BB is seat5, seat1 is after seat5? Not sure. But given actions: \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning it's our turn and no bet yet. So we have option to check or raise. Minimum raise to 11 (so raise must be at least 11 total). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot call because no bet.\n\nWe need decide: likely we should check and maybe fold later if bet. Raising could be bluff. Our hand is weak, but we could attempt a semi-bluff to take pot. Opponent likely has strong hand; raising could be called and we lose chips. However we have decent stack and could attempt a steal? But board is not particularly scary (no Ace). Opp could have Q, 9, etc. If we raise, opponent may call with many hands, causing us to lose more.\n\nThus best is to check, see opponent action. If opponent bets, we can decide to call or fold based on size. Since we have no strong hand, we likely fold to any bet.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReasoning: weak hand, opponent likely strong, preserve stack.\n\nReturn JSON."

            "reasoning_content": "We have a hand: BB with TdKd. Board Qs 9s 8h 2d. Turn action: opponent (Seat1 Kimi-K2) bet 22 into pot 67 (pre-turn). Actually pot after flop: preflop pot 6+6+? Let's compute: Preflop: BB raised 6, K1 called 6 => pot 12 + blinds 3? Actually SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then raise to 6 (BB) means BB added 4 more? Usually raise to 6 means total contribution 6 from BB. So pot after preflop: SB 1, BB 6, K1 6 =13. Flop: BB bet 4, K1 raise to 15 (total 15), BB call 11 (so BB puts additional 11). So flop pot: previous 13 + 4 + 15 + 11 = 43? Wait need to track: after flop betting, contributions: BB 4+11=15 total on flop, K1 15. So added 30. Pot now 13+30=43. Turn: BB checked, K1 bet 22. So pot before turn bet = 43. K1 bet 22, now pot 65. Amount to call 22, min raise 44.\n\nOur hand TdKd: we have gutshot straight draw? Board Qs 9s 8h 2d. Our hand: Ten of diamonds and King of diamonds. We have open-ended straight draw? Actually we have 8-9-10-J-Q? No J missing. We have K and T. Board has Q,9,8,2. So we have gutshot to straight: need J for 8-9-10-J-Q? Actually we have 10, board 8,9,Q => need J for straight 8-9-10-J-Q. That's a gutshot (one card). Also we have backdoor flush draws? Both diamonds, board has no diamonds, so any two diamonds would give flush but only one diamond on board? Actually board has no diamonds, so we have two diamonds in hand, need three more diamonds on turn and river to make flush, unlikely.\n\nWe also have top pair? No. We have K high, but board top is Q. So we have K kicker but not a pair.\n\nThus our hand is weak. Opponent bet 22 on turn. What is opponent likely? He raised on flop after our bet. Flop board: Qs 9s 8h. He raised to 15 after our 4 bet. He could have Q, 9, 8, straight draws, two pair, etc. Turn 2d (no spade). He bets 22.\n\nWe have to decide fold, call, raise. Likely fold. But consider pot odds: pot before turn bet = 43. Opponent bet 22, pot now 65. To call 22 to win 65, pot odds ~ 22/65 = 0.338 => need ~33% equity. Our hand: we have gutshot 4 outs (J) plus maybe backdoor flush (2 diamonds in hand, need two diamonds on river). But immediate outs are J of any suit (4 outs). However some J's may be blocked by opponent's holdings? But approximate equity: 4 outs out of unknown remaining 46 cards = ~8.7% chance to hit on river. Not enough. So fold.\n\nConsider possibility of raising as bluff? Our stack 183, we could raise to 44 min. But we have weak hand, opponent likely strong, raising may be called and we lose more. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

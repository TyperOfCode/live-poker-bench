            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- I'm in SB with Qd As (Ace-Queen suited)\n- My stack: 110 chips (27.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 18 chips\n- Facing a raise from GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 to 12 chips (3x BB)\n- Need to call 10 chips to continue\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n- Hand 39: Preflop fold\n- Hand 38: Preflop check (BB), flop fold\n- Hand 37: Preflop fold\n- Hand 36: Preflop fold\n- Hand 35: Preflop call 4, flop bet 8\n- Hand 34: Turn check, river check, river fold\n\nThis opponent seems to be playing relatively tight, folding a lot preflop. When they do enter hands (like hand 35), they show aggression postflop. The raise to 12 chips from late position suggests a strong hand.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\nQd As is a premium hand, especially from SB. It's:\n- Top 5-6% hand strength\n- Strong against most ranges\n- Has good playability postflop\n- Can dominate weaker aces and queens\n\n**Stack/Pot Considerations:**\n- I have 110 chips, so calling 10 is only ~9% of my stack\n- The pot is already 18, and I need to call 10, giving me 1.8:1 immediate odds\n- If I 3-bet, I could take control of the hand\n- My stack is healthy at 27.5 BB, not desperate\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm out of position as SB, which is a disadvantage\n- However, with a premium hand like AQ, this is less concerning\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm not short-stacked, so I don't need to take unnecessary risks\n- But AQ is strong enough to play for value\n- I could 3-bet to define my opponent's range and potentially win the pot preflop\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Too tight with AQ. This is a clear fold only if opponent is extremely tight and we have strong reads.\n2. **Call**: Reasonable. I see a flop with a strong hand, keep the pot smaller out of position.\n3. **Raise**: Also reasonable. 3-betting to ~30-35 chips would be standard. This would:\n   - Define opponent's range\n   - Take initiative\n   - Potentially win preflop\n   - Build pot when I likely have the best hand\n\nLooking at my recent hands from SB, I've been folding a lot (hands 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 all folded preflop). This suggests I should start playing back with strong hands.\n\nGiven that GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop but just raised, they likely have a strong range (AJ+, KQ+, 77+). AQ is doing well against this range.\n\nI think the best play is to **3-bet**. I should raise to about 30-35 chips (2.5-3x the raise). This is standard with AQ out of position.\n\nLet me calculate the raise amount:\n- Minimum raise is 20 (to match the raise amount)\n- Standard 3-bet would be 3x their raise = 36 chips\n- I could also go slightly less, like 30-32 chips\n\nGiven my stack and position, I'll raise to 30 chips. This is a solid 3-bet size that:\n- Gives them bad odds to call with marginal hands\n- Doesn't commit too much of my stack\n- Leaves room to fold if they 4-bet big\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 110 chips and facing a 12 chip raise, if I 3-bet to 30 and they 4-bet, I might be in a tough spot. But AQ is strong enough to call a 4-bet or even shove depending on sizing.\n\nI think raising to 30 is the correct play. It shows strength, defines their range, and builds the pot with what is likely the best hand.",

My opponent called my 3-bet preflop, suggesting a decent hand, but I likely have them beat with top pair. I should bet for value against weaker Aces and pocket pairs, and to protect against any potential straight draws. Betting half pot (32 chips) extracts value while keeping the pot manageable given my 20.5 BB stack.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  The hand history shows I have A\u2660 Q\u2666 on a board of 3\u2665 4\u2660 A\u2663. I have top pair with a good kicker (Ace with Queen kicker). The pot is 64 chips and I have 82 chips left.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have top pair (Aces) with a good kicker (Queen). The board is relatively dry - only a possible straight draw with 2-5 or 5-7, but it's unlikely given the action. There's no flush draw. I likely have the best hand here.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB position. The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) is in Seat 5, which would be the cutoff or button position depending on the table setup. They have position on me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the history I just recalled:\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been playing quite tight - lots of folds preflop\n   - They made one big raise of 162 chips preflop in hand 28 (which suggests they can have strong hands)\n   - In hand 34, they called preflop, then checked down to the river and folded\n   - In hand 35, they called preflop and bet 8 on the flop\n   - They seem to be a relatively tight player who doesn't get involved much\n\n4. **Action analysis**: Preflop, they raised to 12, I re-raised to 30, and they called 18. This suggests they have a decent hand that could call a 3-bet. Their range likely includes: pocket pairs (TT+), AJ+, KQ, maybe some suited connectors.\n\n5. **Board texture**: The A\u2663 3\u2665 4\u2660 board is good for my hand but also connects with many hands that would call a 3-bet:\n   - Any Ace (but I have them out-kicked with AQ unless they have AK or AQ)\n   - Pocket pairs (but only AA beats me, and they'd likely 4-bet with AA)\n   - No real draws except a gutshot with 5 (for a straight) or 2-5, 5-7\n   \nLooking at my hand, I have a strong hand. But I need to consider that my opponent called my 3-bet preflop. They could have:\n- A weaker Ace (AJ, AT) - I'm ahead\n- A pocket pair (KK, QQ, JJ, TT) - I'm ahead except AA\n- AK - I'm behind\n- AQ - we're chopping\n- Some suited connectors or bluffs - I'm ahead\n\nGiven that I have top pair good kicker, and the board is relatively dry, I should make a value bet here. I need to charge any draws (though there are few) and get value from weaker hands.\n\nMy stack is 82 chips, and the pot is 64 chips. I should bet about 1/2 to 2/3 pot for value. A bet of 32-42 chips seems appropriate.\n\nHowever, I need to consider my stack size. I'm relatively short-stacked at 20.5 BB. If I bet and get raised, I might have to commit my stack. But with top pair top kicker on a dry board, I'm comfortable getting it in against this opponent who seems to play straightforwardly.\n\nLet me think about the minimum raise amount. It says minimum raise to 18, but that seems odd since the amount to call is 0. Let me check - actually, the minimum bet is probably 18 (maybe 1/2 pot or something). I should bet for value.\n\nI'll make a bet of about 32 chips (half pot) to extract value from weaker hands and protect my hand.",

I've been folding a lot of hands (31 folds out of 39 hands, only 7 wins). My win rate is 17.9%.\n2. From the opponent observations:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has shown some aggression. In hand #31, they 3-bet preflop to 28 chips with Qh Ah. They also raised in hand #36.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) raised to 16 in hand #30 from UTG+1 position after I folded. They also raised to 8 in hand #31 from UTG.\n   - Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) raised in hands #32, #37, #39.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) seems more passive, mostly calling or checking.\n\nBeing UTG with pocket deuces is a marginal hand. The standard play with small pocket pairs in early position is usually to limp or fold, as they have reverse implied odds - you're hoping to hit a set (about 12% chance) and get paid off, but you're out of position and vulnerable to raises behind you.\n\nGiven that there are aggressive players behind me (MiniMax-M2 in seat 4, Kimi-K2 in seat 2), if I limp, there's a good chance someone will raise behind me. If I raise, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position against potentially multiple callers.\n\nMy stack is 51BB, which is decent but not huge. The blinds are small relative to stacks.\n\nConsidering tournament considerations: I should be selective with hands, especially from early position. Pocket deuces is one of the weakest pocket pairs. The risk of getting raised behind me and having to fold is high.\n\nBetter to fold here and wait for a better spot. I'm not in a desperate chip situation at 51BB. I can afford to be patient.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns with the players behind me. Looking at hand #30: when I folded 33 from UTG, MiniMax-M2 raised to 16 from UTG+1. So they might raise if I limp.\n\nIn hand #31: MiniMax-M2 raised to 8 from UTG when everyone folded to them.\n\nSo both Kimi-K2 and MiniMax-M2 have shown willingness to raise.\n\nThus, folding is the prudent play. I'll preserve my stack and wait for better opportunities."

Looking at the history, I see:\n\n1. I've been folding a lot of hands (31 folds out of 39 hands, only 7 wins). My win rate is 17.9%.\n2. From the opponent observations:\n   - Kimi-K2 Thinking (Seat 1) has shown some aggression. In hand #31, they 3-bet preflop to 28 chips with Qh Ah. They also raised in hand #36.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) raised to 16 in hand #30 from UTG+1 position after I folded. They also raised to 8 in hand #31 from UTG.\n   - Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) raised in hands #32, #37, #39.\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) seems more passive, mostly calling or checking.\n\nBeing UTG with pocket deuces is a marginal hand. The standard play with small pocket pairs in early position is usually to limp or fold, as they have reverse implied odds - you're hoping to hit a set (about 12% chance) and get paid off, but you're out of position and vulnerable to raises behind you.\n\nGiven that there are aggressive players behind me (MiniMax-M2 in seat 4, Kimi-K2 in seat 2), if I limp, there's a good chance someone will raise behind me. If I raise, I'll be playing a weak hand out of position against potentially multiple callers.\n\nMy stack is 51BB, which is decent but not huge. The blinds are small relative to stacks.\n\nConsidering tournament considerations: I should be selective with hands, especially from early position. Pocket deuces is one of the weakest pocket pairs. The risk of getting raised behind me and having to fold is high.\n\nBetter to fold here and wait for a better spot. I'm not in a desperate chip situation at 51BB. I can afford to be patient.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific patterns with the players behind me. Looking at hand #30: when I folded 33 from UTG, MiniMax-M2 raised to 16 from UTG+1. So they might raise if I limp.\n\nIn hand #31: MiniMax-M2 raised to 8 from UTG when everyone folded to them.\n\nSo both Kimi-K2 and MiniMax-M2 have shown willingness to raise.\n\nThus, folding is the prudent play. I'll preserve my stack and wait for better opportunities.",

No need to force marginal hands.\n\n**Tournament Strategy**: In tournament play, especially early to mid-stage, preserving stack is important. Opening with Qs 8d from UTG risks too many chips for a marginal hand.\n\nThe minimum raise to 8 chips would put about 2.7% of my stack at risk for a hand that's not strong enough for this position.

So raise amount would be 8 total (i.e., 4 extra). Need to decide.\n\nConsider hand: Qc Kh suited? No, Qc and Kh are offsuit (different suits). It's a decent hand, broadway, could be strong. Position: BTN, can steal blinds. Opponents: Seat1 (SB) and Seat2 (BB). We have info on Seat1 raise patterns: mostly raises of 6 (i.e., 3bb) in earlier hands, one raise of 28 (big) and one raise of 8 (2bb). So SB sometimes raises modestly. Not sure about BB.\n\nWe are facing 4 to call. Pot currently 6 (SB 2 + BB 4). If we raise to 8 (i.e., add 4), pot becomes 12 (if called). Actually raise to 8 total means we put 8 chips, raising 4 more. That would be a small raise (2bb). Could be a standard steal. Our hand QK offsuit is good for steal. Stack 46.5 BB, comfortable.\n\nWe could also consider calling (just limping) but that invites action from BB and SB. Better to raise.\n\nShould we consider a larger raise? Minimum raise is 8. Could raise more, but not given as legal? Legal actions include raise (any raise above min). We could raise to larger amount, but typical steal raise maybe 3bb (12). But we have only 4 to call, min raise to 8 is 2bb total. Actually 2bb raise is small, might be considered a \"limp-raise\"? Not typical. But we can raise bigger, like to 12 or 14.\n\nGiven opponent SB sometimes raises 6 (3bb) preflop, they may be aggressive. If they raise, they likely have strong hand. But we are acting now before them. If we raise to 8, SB may call or fold. If they call, BB may also call. Our hand QK offsuit can still be good.\n\nGiven stack size, we can afford a standard raise of 12 (3bb). That would be raise_to 12. Is that allowed? Minimum raise to 8, so raise_to 12 is fine. Should we raise to 12? Might be better to apply pressure.\n\nThus decision: raise to 12. Reason: good hand, position, steal, opponent tendencies.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have Qc Kh on BTN. Preflop: we raised to 12 (3BB). Seat1 (Kimi) re-raised to 30 (7.5BB). Now we face a 18 call to 30 (i.e., we need to call 18 more to match 30). Minimum raise to 48 (i.e., raise to 48 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength, position (BTN), stack 174 chips (43.5 BB). Effective stack: opponent has 82 chips (20.5 BB). So we are deeper relative to opponent. Kimi's behavior: from recall, he sometimes raises preflop (hand 31 raise 28, hand 36 raise 8). So he can be aggressive. He raised to 8 (2BB) earlier, which is small. He also raised to 28 (7BB) in hand 31. He also re-raised us now to 30 (7.5BB). So likely a strong hand, maybe premium or strong broadway.\n\nOur hand Qc Kh: decent, but not premium. In BTN vs SB re-raise, typical action could be 3-bet or fold. But we already raised, now facing a 3-bet (actually a 2-bet after our raise). It's a 3-bet situation. Stack depths: opponent 82, we 174. 3-bet size 30 vs our 12 raise (so 2.5x our raise). That's a standard 3-bet. Our hand QK offsuit is a decent 3-bet candidate but can also call. However, opponent's stack is shallow (20BB). If we call, we will be in a pot of 30+12+2 (SB+BB) = 46? Actually pot currently 46 (as given). If we call, pot becomes 64 (add 18). Opponent's effective stack after call is 82-30=52 chips left. So post-flop, we would be out of position with 52 chips vs our 174-30=144 left (if we call). That is a big stack difference. Could be okay to call with QK but risk of playing out of position.\n\nAlternatively, we could 4-bet (raise to 48). Minimum raise to 48 total, which is a 3BB raise over his 30 (i.e., raise to 48 = additional 18). That's a small 4-bet, about 1.6x his 3-bet. That would be a small 4-bet, maybe as a bluff or semi-bluff. With QK, we could 4-bet as a value raise against a wide 3-bet range. But opponent's stack is short; a 4-bet to 48 would commit 48 chips (27% of his stack). He may call or shove.\n\nWe need to consider tournament: we have 43.5 BB, opponent 20.5 BB. We could try to isolate and win chips. QK is a strong hand, but not as strong as AK, AQ, JJ+. But still ahead of many 3-bet ranges. If opponent is 3-betting wide, we can 4-bet. If tight, maybe just call.\n\nGiven opponent's past raises: hand 31 raise 28 (big) then bet flop big, indicating strong hand. Hand 36 raise 8 (small) maybe a steal. So his 3-bet size 30 could be strong.\n\nThus perhaps best to call and see flop, given we are out of position but have stack advantage. However, calling gives him good implied odds to shove later. A 4-bet could isolate and perhaps win the pot preflop if he folds. If he calls, we go heads-up with a decent hand.\n\nI think 4-bet to 48 is a good move: it's a small 4-bet, but we have deep stack; we could also go all-in? Minimum raise is 48, not all-in. All-in would be 174, too big.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, preserving chips vs a potentially strong opponent: maybe call and see flop, because QK offsuit can flop a straight draw etc. But being out of position is disadvantage.\n\nI lean to raise to 48 (4-bet) as a semi-bluff/value. Reason: isolate, leverage stack advantage, and QK is ahead of many 3-bet ranges.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 48.\n\n",

Stack is 381 chips.\n- GPT-OSS-120B (BB, seat 5): Has been folding a lot but raised twice in the last few hands (hand 55 raised to 24, hand 56 raised to 20). Stack is 140 chips.\n\nI'm on the button with position advantage. With 9s8c, this is a decent speculative hand that can make straights and flushes. At 19 BB, I need to be careful but also accumulate chips.\n\nSince both blinds are left, and I have position, I could consider raising to steal the blinds. However, GPT-OSS-120B has shown some aggression recently with raises. MiniMax-M2 has been mostly folding.\n\nThe pot is 12 chips (SB 4 + BB 8). If I raise to 16 (minimum raise), that's committing 16 chips (about 10.5% of my stack). If I get called or re-raised, I'll have to play postflop with a marginal hand.\n\nBetter to just call and see a flop in position with a speculative hand. 8 chips is only 5.3% of my stack. If I hit a good flop (pair with straight draw, flush draw, etc.), I can continue. If not, I can fold.\n\nFolding seems too tight given my position and the small investment. Raising commits too much with a marginal hand.\n\nI'll call.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current hand:**\n- My position: BTN (button)\n- My hand: 9s 8c (offsuit 9-8)\n- My stack: 144 chips (18 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 42 chips\n- Action: I limped for 8, SB folded, BB (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 30 total\n- Amount to call: 22 more\n- Minimum raise: 52 total\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\nFrom the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has been mostly folding preflop (7 of last 10 hands). However, in the last 3 hands I can see:\n- Hand #55: raised to 24\n- Hand #56: raised to 20  \n- Hand #57: folded\n- Now hand #58: raised to 30\n\nSo they've raised 3 of the last 4 hands they've played. This could indicate they're opening up their raising range, possibly trying to steal blinds. Their stack is 118 chips (14.75 BB), which is shorter than my 144 chips.\n\n**My hand strength:**\n9-8 offsuit is a weak hand. However, being on the button with position is advantageous. I already invested 8 chips to limp.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is currently 42 chips (8 from SB, 8 from BB, 8 from my limp, plus 18 from BB's raise)\n- I need to call 22 more\n- Pot odds: 22 to win 64 (42+22) = 34.4% equity needed\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 18 BB, opponent has 14.75 BB\n- This is a tournament where stack preservation is important\n- 9-8o doesn't have great equity against a BB's raising range\n\n**Positional advantage:**\nBeing on the button means I have position postflop, which is valuable.\n\n**Opponent's likely range:**\nGiven they've raised 3 of last 4 hands, their range is likely wide. They might be trying to steal with many hands since they're in the BB facing a limp.\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. Weak hand (9-8o)\n2. Already invested 8 chips\n3. Position advantage\n4. Opponent likely has wide range\n5. Pot odds require ~34% equity\n6. Stack sizes: 18BB vs 14.75BB\n\n9-8o against a wide BB defending range has about 35-40% equity, which meets pot odds. However, this is close and postflop play will be challenging with a weak hand.\n\nGiven the tournament situation and that I'm not desperate (18 BB is playable), folding seems prudent. Calling 22 more (15% of my stack) with a weak hand is risky. The opponent has shown aggression recently, so they might continue betting postflop.\n\nI think the best play is to fold and preserve my stack for a better spot.",

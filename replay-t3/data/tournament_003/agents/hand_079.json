            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation carefully.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the Button (Seat 1) with 2c 9d (offsuit, very weak hand)\n- My stack: 210 chips (13.1 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 164 chips\n- Facing a raise from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) who is in the small blind position\n- Amount to call: 132 chips\n- This would leave me with 78 chips if I call\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5):**\nLooking at the recent actions:\n- Hand 71: Called preflop, then bet 48 on flop\n- Hand 72: Folded preflop\n- Hand 73: Folded preflop\n- Hand 74: Raised to 48 preflop, folded on flop\n- Hand 75: Folded preflop\n- Hand 76: Raised to 148 preflop (same sizing as now!)\n- Hand 77: Folded preflop\n- Hand 78: Folded preflop\n\nThis is very telling! In Hand 76, GPT-OSS-120B made the exact same raise sizing (148 chips) from the small blind. This is almost certainly a pattern. The fact that they folded several times and then use this exact sizing suggests it's a strong hand or a bluff sizing they like to use.\n\n**Hand strength:** 2c 9d is garbage. One of the worst hands in poker. Offsuit, no connectivity, low cards.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 132 to win 164, which is about 1.24:1. I need about 45% equity to justify a call. With 2c 9d, I likely have around 30-35% equity against a typical raising range, and probably less given this specific sizing pattern.\n\n**Tournament situation:** I have 13.1 BB. If I call 132, I'll be left with only 78 chips (4.9 BB), which is critically short. I'd be pot-committed and in terrible shape. \n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button, which is good, but with this hand it doesn't matter much.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. \n\n1. My hand is extremely weak\n\n\n2. The opponent's consistent raise sizing hints at a deliberate strategy\n3. Calling would severely compromise my tournament life\n4. The potential return doesn't justify the significant chip risk\n5. Preserving my current stack is more valuable than chasing an unlikely pot\n\nThe strategic move is to fold and wait for a stronger hand.",

The blinds are 8/16. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is in the big blind with 210 chips (13.1 BB). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has 188 chips (11.8 BB). Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) has 148 chips (9.25 BB) and posted the small blind.\n\nLooking at opponent actions: Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) has been quite aggressive preflop, making several raises to 178 chips (over 11 BB) when they have the opportunity. They raised to 178 in hand 69, 73, and 77. In hand 77 they raised to 40, which is smaller. They've also folded several times preflop.\n\nGiven that I'm in UTG with a weak ace-suited hand, and there are aggressive players behind me, this is a clear fold situation. A2s is not strong enough to open from UTG, especially with short stacks behind who might shove. The suited ace has some potential but from early position with 24.6 BB, it's better to wait for a stronger hand.\n\nAlso, considering tournament dynamics: I have a decent stack (24.6 BB) relative to others at the table, so I can afford to be selective. Seat 1 in the BB has been aggressive and could easily raise if I limp or min-raise.\n\nBetter to fold and preserve my stack for a better spot.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have data: Kimi-K2 Thinking raises varied amounts, from small 6 to huge 178 (all-in). So they can be aggressive, sometimes all-in. We have 9 BB, not huge. Raising to 32 may invite a re-raise or call. Since we are short stack, maybe we should just call and see flop? But with AQ, we have good equity. However being in blind, if we raise to 32, we risk being 3-bet all-in? Opponent may shove all-in with 178? Actually opponent's stack is 210 chips, so all-in would be 210. Our raise to 32 is small compared to that. If opponent re-raises all-in, we would be forced to call all-in with AQ, which is okay? 148 vs 210, we would be short. Might be okay.\n\nBut given we have 9 BB, we could also go all-in (148). But that is a large raise, maybe not needed. Considering tournament, preserving stack is important. AQ is strong, but not premium like AA, KK. Short stack strategy: push or fold. With 9 BB, typical push/fold threshold is around 10 BB; many push with AQ. So maybe go all-in.\n\nBut we have only 148 chips, which is 9.2 BB, we could push all-in to maximize fold equity. The opponent may call with weaker hands. So go all-in.\n\nLegal actions include raise; raise_to can be total amount. All-in would be 148 (or maybe 148 total? we already posted 16, so need to add 132 more to reach 148). But raise_to should be total amount we are putting in, i.e., 148? Usually raise_to is total bet amount. Since we have posted 16, raising to 148 means adding 132. That's fine.\n\nThus action: raise to 148 (all-in). Reason: short stack, strong hand, maximize fold equity, opponent aggressive.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Prefers raising to 12 when they enter pots.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n- AQ suited hearts is a premium hand, especially on the button\n- Great for stealing, can dominate many hands\n- I have position on both players post-flop\n- Pot odds: Need to call 8 to win 22 (about 2.75:1) - very good\n\n**My Recent Play:**\n- I've been playing very tight (25 folds out of 30 hands)\n- My win rate is low (16.7%) suggesting I might be playing too tight\n- Need to be more aggressive with premium hands\n\n**Decision:**\nWith AQ suited on the button facing a small raise (only 2x BB) and a call, I should definitely play this hand. I have three options:\n\n1. **Call (8 chips)**: See a flop in position. Conservative but gives up initiative.\n2. **Raise**: Take control of the hand. With my tight image, a raise will get respect.\n   - Minimum raise to 12 is too small - gives good odds to opponents\n   - Standard raise would be to 24-32 (3-4x the raise)\n   - Given stack sizes, I could raise to 24 (3x) or even 32 (4x)\n\n3. **Fold**: Too tight with this premium hand and position.\n\nThe best play is to raise. A raise to 24-32 will:\n- Isolate one opponent or take down the pot preflop\n- Give me initiative post-flop\n- Leverage my tight image\n- Get value from weaker hands\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2 has shown they can fold to pressure, and GPT-OSS-120B can be tight, I'll make a solid raise to 28 (3.5x the original raise), which is a standard size.\n\nLet me reconsider: The pot is 22, I need to call 8. If I raise to 24 total (3x the 8), that's only adding 16 more. That might be too small. A better raise would be to 28 or 32. Given the stack depths (everyone has 45+ BB), I can raise to 32 comfortably.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise: \"Minimum raise to: 12\" - this means I need to put in at least 12 total, which is only 4 more than the 8 to call. That's a min-raise and not recommended.\n\nI think the better sizing is to 32 total (which is 24 more to call for others). This is about 4x the original raise, standard for a 3-bet.\n\nWait, let me think about this more carefully. The \"raise_to\" field should be the TOTAL amount I'm putting in. If I want to raise to 32, that means I'm putting in 32 chips total. Since the big blind was 4, and there's been a raise to 8, I need to match that 8 first, then add more.\n\nActually, I think the \"raise_to\" means the total bet size I want to make. So if I say \"raise_to\": 28, that means I'm betting 28 chips total. Since I need to call 8, I'm raising an additional 20.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and opponent tendencies, I should make a substantial raise. Let me go with 28 total, which is a 3.5x raise of the original 8. This is strong but not overcommitting.\n\n"

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand Information:**\n- Hand #31, FLOP stage\n- My Position: BTN (Button)\n- My Cards: Qh Ah (Ace-Queen suited, hearts)\n- My Stack: 178 chips\n- Board: 5h 3c 6d (rainbow, no flush draw possible yet, but I have backdoor flush draw)\n- Pot: 70 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (Opponent checked)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n- Minimum raise to: 20\n\n**Preflop Action Analysis:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8\n- Seat 5 called 8\n- I (Seat 1) 3-bet to 28\n- Seat 4 called 20 (so they have something)\n- Seat 5 folded\n\nSo going to the flop, it's heads-up between me and MiniMax-M2.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n- I have AQh, which is a strong starting hand\n- Flop is 5h 3c 6d - completely missed me. I have no pair, no draw except backdoor flush and straight draws\n- However, this is a very dry, low board that likely missed my opponent's range too\n\n**Opponent Information (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 26: Preflop fold\n- Hand 27: Called preflop 10, bet flop 15, checked turn, bet river 15\n- Hand 28: Raised preflop to 20, then folded to a 3-bet\n- Hand 29: Called preflop 4, bet flop 4\n- Hand 30: Raised preflop to 16\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 is active preflop, raises frequently (hands 28, 30), but folded to a 3-bet in hand 28. They also make small continuation bets.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- MiniMax-M2 called my preflop 3-bet, then checked the flop\n- This suggests they likely have a medium strength hand or a draw\n- The check could be:\n  1. Weak hand giving up\n  2. Strong hand trapping\n  3. Marginal hand checking to see what I do\n\n**My Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card, see if I improve on turn. Pot is 70, I could check back and try to hit.\n2. **Raise (bet)**: Apply pressure. Since they checked, I can represent a strong hand. Minimum raise is 20 (which is a bet in this context).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- I have position (on the button)\n- The board is very dry (5-3-6 rainbow)\n- My opponent called a 3-bet preflop, suggesting some strength\n- They checked, which is often weak\n- I have 2 overcards, which are good but not great\n- Stack sizes: I have 178, opponent has 163, so deep enough\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I should be looking to accumulate chips\n- With AQ on a dry board, a continuation bet is standard\n- Checking is too passive and gives up on the pot\n\n**Decision**: I should make a continuation bet. The standard sizing would be about 1/2 to 2/3 pot. Pot is 70, so 35-45 would be appropriate. Minimum is 20, which is about 28% of pot - a bit small but acceptable as a probe bet.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Since the opponent checked to me, and the board is so dry, I should bet to take it down. A bet of 35 (half pot) would be good.\n\nBut wait - the minimum raise is listed as 20. In this context, since I'm the first to act on the flop and there's no bet to call, a \"raise\" of 20 means betting 20 chips total.\n\nLet me think about sizing:\n- 20 chips is 28% of pot (70) - small\n- 35 chips would be 50% of pot - standard\n- 45 chips would be 65% of pot - slightly larger\n\nGiven my opponent's tendency to make small bets themselves (they bet 15 into unknown pots in hands 27 and 29), a smaller bet might be effective. Also, since they folded to a 3-bet before, they might be capable of folding.\n\nI think a bet of 35 (half pot) is appropriate here. It applies pressure, charges draws, and gives me a chance to win the pot right now.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the format. It says \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount. So if I want to bet 35, I put"

This is a strong drawing hand on a dry board. I have 6 outs to top pair (3 Queens, 3 Aces), plus backdoor flush and straight possibilities.\n\n2. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the recall data, MiniMax-M2:\n   - Raises preflop frequently (hands 28, 30)\n   - Folded to a 3-bet once (hand 28)\n   - Makes small continuation bets (15 chips in hands 27, 29)\n   - Has shown they can fold\n\n3. **Board Texture**: Very dry - 5-3-6 rainbow. Unlikely to have hit opponent's preflop calling range hard. They would likely have bet if they had a set or two pair.\n\n4. **Position**: I have the button, which is a huge advantage. I can control the pot size and get information.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: Pot is 70, if I bet 35 (half pot), I'm risking 35 to win 70.\n\n6. **Tournament Strategy**: I should be accumulating chips. Checking here is too passive and gives up on a pot I could win.\n\n**Decision**: I should make a continuation bet. This is a standard play with AQ on a dry board after being the preflop aggressor. The opponent's check suggests weakness.\n\n**Sizing**: A half-pot bet of 35 chips is appropriate.

The 35-chip bet on the river is about 20% of the pot.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 175 chips\n- To call: 35 chips\n- Pot odds: 210:35 or 6:1\n\n\n- I only need to win 14.3% of the time to break even\n\n**My Hand Strength:**\n- I have Ace-high\n- The board is relatively coordinated with straight possibilities\n- My opponent called a 3-bet preflop and called a 35-chip flop bet\n- The turn check-check suggests weakness from both sides\n- The river bet could be:\n  1. A value bet with a made hand (pair, two pair, straight)\n  2. A bluff with missed draws\n  3. A thin value bet with Ace-high (like they did in hand 27)\n\n**Opponent's Range:**\nGiven they called a 3-bet preflop and called a flop bet on 5h 3c 6d, they could have:\n- Pocket pairs (77, 88, 99, TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA)\n- Suited connectors that hit the board\n- Ace-high hands\n- Some bluffs\n\nOn the river board (5h 3c 6d Td 9h), they could have:\n- Made straights: 78, 74\n- Two pairs: T9, 96, 65, etc.\n- Pairs: TT, 99, 66, 55, 33\n- Ace-high hands\n- Complete air/bluffs\n\n**Decision:**\nThe opponent's betting pattern is interesting. They checked the turn, which suggests they didn't have a strong hand. Now they're betting 35 on the river. This could be:\n1. A value bet with a made hand that checked turn for pot control\n2. A bluff with missed draws\n3. A thin value bet with Ace-high or a small pair\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to make small bets (as seen in hands 24, 27, 29), and the fact that they called a 3-bet preflop and a flop bet, I think they have some showdown value. However, the price is good (6:1 pot odds).\n\nI need to win only 14.3% of the time. With Ace-high, against an opponent who can bluff and make thin value bets, I think I have enough equity to call. The opponent's stack is only 93 chips, so they're not betting huge relative to their stack.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that my opponent might be betting a made hand that checked the turn for pot control. The board is somewhat coordinated, and they might have hit two pair or a straight.\n\nLet me think about the EV:\n- If I call and win: +210 chips\n\n\n- If I call and lose: -35 chips\n- Break-even point:"

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- My hand: 3h Qd (Q3o) - very weak hand\n- Position: SB (worst position except BB)\n- My stack: 194 chips (48.5 BB)\n- Pot: 50 chips\n- Action: Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8, Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) called, Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) 3-bet to 28\n- Amount to call: 24 chips (12.5% of my stack)\n- Minimum raise to: 48 chips\n\n**Analysis of opponents:**\n1. Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking): Has shown consistent small raises (6 chips) preflop in previous hands. This 3-bet to 28 is much larger than their previous raises, suggesting strength.\n2. Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has been aggressive with raises (16, 65, 20, 16). Showdown hands include A8 and KJ - shows they play a range.\n3. Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Tends to call preflop rather than raise.\n\n**My hand evaluation:**\nQ3o is a terrible hand, especially from SB position. It's dominated by most raising ranges. Even if I hit a Q, I'm often behind to AQ, KQ, QJ, etc. The 3 is virtually worthless.\n\n**Pot odds:** \n- Pot is 50 chips, I need to call 24 chips. That's 50:24 or ~2.08:1 pot odds (32% equity needed).\n- My hand has nowhere near 32% equity against a 3-betting range.\n\n**Position:** SB is the worst position - I'll have to act first on every street, making postflop play difficult.\n\n**Stack considerations:** 24 chips is 12.5% of my stack. Calling with a weak hand out of position could lead to losing much more postflop.\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 48.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. No need to gamble with Q3o.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is an easy fold. The hand is too weak, position is terrible, and there's already significant action with a 3-bet. Better to preserve my stack for better spots.",

This gives me:\n   - Top pair (Aces)\n   - A 5 which gives me one pair\n   - The board is fairly coordinated but not too dangerous\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**: Looking at Kimi-K2 Thinking's flop behavior from the recall:\n   - They've shown a mix of checking and betting\n   - In recent hands, they've been checking quite a bit (hands 24, 29)\n   - They seem to be a relatively passive player on the flop\n\n4. **Pot situation**: \n   - Pot is 70 chips\n   - I have 163 chips (40.8 BB)\n   - No bet to me, so it's a check to me\n   - Minimum raise would be to 20 chips total\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I'm at 40.8 BB, so I have a decent stack. This isn't an all-in situation, but I should be mindful of stack preservation.\n\n6. **Hand strength**: With top pair (Aces), I have a hand that's ahead of most of their range. The fact that they checked suggests they might have a weaker hand.\n\nGiven that:\n- I have top pair with a decent kicker\n- The opponent has been checking frequently on flops\n- I have position (they acted first and checked)\n- I can check and see what they do, or I can bet to charge them\n\nI think the best play here is to **check** and see what they do. If they bet, I can call or raise depending on the size. If they check again, I can consider betting on the turn. This allows me to pot control while still protecting my hand.\n",

Position: I'm in the BB position, so I'm last to act on the flop.\n\n6. Board texture: The board is 5h 3c 6d - this is a disconnected board that doesn't offer many drawing opportunities for opponents. It's unlikely opponents have strong drawing hands.\n\nGiven all this analysis:\n- My hand is very strong (trips)\n- I'm getting excellent pot odds\n- The opponent seems to be betting with a range of hands\n- The board doesn't offer many draws\n\nI should call here. Raising would be too aggressive given the pot odds and the fact that I want to keep some weaker hands in the opponent's range that might continue on later streets. Calling gives me the best risk/reward ratio.\n\nThe minimum raise to 70 would put in a significant amount of my stack and might scare away the hands I want to extract value from.\n",

With the board showing paired 5s and no clear threats, my hand looks reasonably strong. The 35-chip minimum raise feels like a strategic move to potentially win the pot without excessive risk.

Effective stack large.\n\nKcJc suited is a decent hand, but not premium. In CO facing raise from MP? Seat 4 is MP (since CO is seat5). Opponent's tendencies: recall shows that MiniMax-M2 has raised preflop amounts 20, 16, also called, folded etc. No clear aggression pattern. Could be standard.\n\nWe must consider pot odds: call 8 to a pot of 14+8? Actually current pot is 14 (blinds) + 8 (their raise) = 22, we call 8 to win 22, pot odds ~ 27% (8/22). Hand equity vs random? KcJc suited vs random ~ 12% vs 2 players? Actually heads-up vs random ~ 12%? Wait KcJc suited vs random hand is about 12-13%? Actually KcJc suited vs random is around 12% equity. That's lower than 27%, so call is not +EV vs random. But opponent may have range narrower than random (maybe 2-3bb openers). In MP, typical opening range maybe 10% (e.g., 22+, A2s+, K9s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T9s, ATo+, KJo+). KcJc is in that range, but as a caller we are ahead of some and behind others. Equity maybe around 45% vs that range? Let's approximate: vs a typical MP opening range, KcJc suited might be about 45% equity. So call is +EV.\n\nRaising? Could 3-bet. With 49BB stack, 3-bet to maybe 24 (minimum raise to 12, but typical 3-bet size 3x raise = 24). That would be a sizable raise, but KcJc suited is a borderline 3-bet hand; could be used as a semi-bluff. Might be okay to call rather than 3-bet.\n\nGiven tournament, preserve stack. I'd call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. So choose call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

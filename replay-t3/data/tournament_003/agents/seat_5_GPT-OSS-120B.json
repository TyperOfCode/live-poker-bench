Actually we have T, board 8-9, we have gutshot straight draw to Q? Ten needs 7 for straight? 8-9-10 gives 10, we have 10, need 7 for 7-8-9-10? Actually straight possibilities: 7-8-9-10-J, we have T, need 7 and J. Not immediate. So just overpair.\n\nOpponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) is in the big blind, called preflop raise. He checked flop. We are in BB, we raised preflop to 4 (so we are the aggressor). On flop, opponent checked. We have 9 pot (9 chips). Our stack 196. So we can bet. Options: check (pot 9, opponent can bet). Or raise (bet). Minimum raise to 2 (so bet 2). Should we bet? Overpair likely best value. Opponent's range: could include 9x, 8x, 77, 66, A9? Actually board 3-9-8, they could have 9x, 8x, T9, JT, Q9, etc. Overpair is strong. Betting small to extract value. Also consider tournament: 98 BB deep, not huge pressure. So bet 2 (pot-size ~9, bet 2 is ~22% pot). Could also bet larger like 4-5 to protect against draws? There are possible straight draws: 7-10? Actually a player could have 7J for open-ended straight draw (7-8-9-10). They could have QJ also open-ended (J-10? Actually board 8-9, QJ would need 10? QJ not straight). Straight draws: 7-10 (7-8-9-10) need 7 or J. Also 10-J (10-J-9-8) need J or Q? Actually board 8-9, you need 10-J to have open-ended? 8-9-10-J is a straight, need 10 and J. So if opponent has J10, they have a straight already? Board 8-9, they have 10-J, they have open-ended? Actually 8-9-10-J is a straight (8-9-10-J). That's four cards, need Q? No, straight is five cards, need 7? Wait a straight is 5 consecutive cards. With board 8-9, you need 7-8-9-10-J or 8-9-10-J-Q. So with J10, they'd have 8-9-10-J, missing either 7 or Q for straight. So J10 is gutshot? Actually they have 8-9-10-J, need either 7 or Q. So not a made straight.\n\nPotential draws: 7-10 (needs 7 or J). 10-J (needs 7 or Q). So some draws exist but not huge. Overpair is best.\n\nThus we raise (bet) to 2 chips (minimum). Reason: extract value from weaker hands, protect against draws.\n\nLegal actions include raise. So output.\n\n",

Board has 3-5-8-9, possible straight draws: 7-6 would give 6-7-8-9-? Not there. 6-7 would need 6 and 7; not present. So board is relatively dry. Our TT is still best likely. Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) is in the big blind, called preflop, checked flop after we bet 2 (we bet 2, they called). On turn they checked. We have pot 13, we are in BB, amount to call is 0 (since opponent checked). We can check or raise. Consider opponent's tendencies: unknown, but we have no history. Our hand is strong, but not nuts? Could be overpair to board, but board has 9,8,5,3. Opponent could have 9x, 8x, 5x, etc. Could have straight draws? Not many. Could have a set? No set possible because board has no pair. Could have two pair? 9-8? Not possible because need both on board. So we likely ahead.\n\nWe might want to extract value. Turn raise size? Minimum raise is 2 (to 4 total?). Actually raise to total 2? Wait: Minimum raise to is 2, meaning we need to raise to at least 2 chips total? The pot is 13, we have bet 0 currently. Minimum raise to 2 means we need to put 2 chips in total? That seems low relative to pot. But typical raise min is current bet + big blind? Actually maybe raise to total of 2 chips (including call). Since amount to call is 0, raising to 2 means bet 2 chips. That's a small raise. Could also raise larger.\n\nWe have deep stack 97 BB, can bet bigger for value. But opponent may call with worse. We could check to pot control but risk giving free card. However board is relatively safe; no flush draws. River will be a blank maybe.\n\nBetter to bet for value. What size? Pot 13, we could bet around half pot (6-7) or pot sized (13). Since opponent is unknown, maybe bet 6-8 chips.\n\nLegal actions: raise to any amount >=2. We have stack 194, can raise up to all-in.\n\nThus choose raise to 8 chips. Reason: we have strong overpair, want value, opponent likely has weaker hand.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Actually we bet 4, then they raised to 15 (so they put in 15 total, meaning they added 11). Amount to call is 11. Minimum raise to 26 (so raise must be to at least 26 total). We have stack 194. Need decision.\n\nWe need to consider hand strength: KdTd gives us open-ended straight draw? Board Qs 9s 8h. We have Ten and King. Straight possibilities: 7-6? Actually we have 10, board 9,8, Q. With K, we have gutshot? Let's see combos: Straight draws: With KdTd, we have a gutshot to a straight: need J to make Q-J-10-9-8? Actually Q- J -10-9-8 would be straight, need J. Also need A for broadway? A Q J 10 9? No we have K not J. So only possible straight is J. Also we have a backdoor flush draw? Suits: board has two spades (Qs, 9s). Our hand has no spade, so no flush draw.\n\nWe have top pair? No Q is on board, we have K and T, no pair. We have overcards: K and T, K is over Q, T is middle.\n\nOpponent raised on flop after our bet. Could be they have Qx, maybe a set (QQ?), but board has Qs only one queen. Could be they have 9s for set? Actually board has 9s, we have no 9. So they could have 99 for set, or 88 for set, or Q? Actually Qs is on board, there is only one queen. They could have Qx for two pair? Not possible because only one queen on board. They could have straight draw like J10, or A K for gutshot? Actually they could have KJ, J9, etc.\n\nWe need to evaluate equity. Our hand: KdTd. Against unknown range, but opponent raised after our bet, maybe they have strong hand or strong draw. Our bet of 4 was small pot bet (pot 34). Opponent raises to 15 (about 3x). That could be a continuation raise with a made hand or a draw.\n\nWe have 11 to call, pot currently 34 + 4 + 15 = 53? Actually pot before opponent's raise: 34 (preflop) + our 4 = 38. Then opponent raises to 15, adding 11 more (since they already called 4? Actually they raise to 15 total, meaning they put in 15, so net addition 11). So pot after raise = 38 + 15 = 53. If we call 11, pot would be 64, we invest 11 for 53? Actually effective pot after call = 53 + 11 = 64. So pot odds: need to call 11 to win 64, about 17% required. So we need equity > 17% to be profitable.\n\nOur hand vs opponent's possible range: likely they have Qx, 99, 88, maybe J10, KJ, etc. Let's approximate: If they have Qx (top pair), they have advantage. If they have a set, we are dead. If they have straight draw J10, they have also a pair? Actually J10 would give them a gutshot (needs J). They have 10, we also have 10, but they could have J10. That would give them pair of tens plus gutshot? Actually board: Q 9 8, they have J10 => they have pair of tens, same as us, but they have J kicker, we have K kicker, we are ahead. But they'd have a gutshot to straight as well. So they might raise with pair, draws, etc.\n\nOur equity maybe around 30% vs a wide range? Hard to know. Also tournament considerations: stack 97 BB, still deep. Should we call? Might be okay.\n\nWe can also consider raising. Minimum raise to 26, which would be a raise of 26 total (so add 12 more beyond call). That would be a pot raise. That could be a semi-bluff if we have backdoor draws? Not much.\n\nBetter to call and see turn? Could be okay.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: we attempted recall but no data. So assume typical.\n\nThus I think call is appropriate.\n\nReturn JSON."

Let's reconstruct: Preflop we raised to 6 (BB raise). Opponent called 6. Flop: we bet 4 (small). Opponent raised to 15 (so 11 more). We called 11. So pot after flop call: initial pot 45? Actually given pot 45 at turn start. So after flop actions, pot is 45.\n\nNow turn card is? Not given yet; we are at turn decision, board currently Qs 9s 8h 2d, turn unknown yet? Actually board shows Qs 9s 8h 2d (that's 4 cards). So turn is 2d. So we have TdKd, board: Qs 9s 8h 2d. Our hand: Ten of diamonds and King of diamonds. We have a gutshot? Let's see possible draws: Straight draws: we have K, T. Board: Q,9,8,2. We have K and T, so possible straight combos: 10-J-Q-K? Actually we have T, board Q,9,8: we have open-ended? Let's list: 8-9-10-J-Q would be a straight if we had J. We have T, need J. So we have gutshot to straight (need J). Also we have K high, no pair. So currently we have just King high, no pair, no flush (two diamonds, board has no diamond). So we are likely behind.\n\nOpponent's range: He called preflop, then raised on flop after our small bet. He likely has strong hand: maybe top pair Q, or a set (9s?), but board has Qs 9s 8h. He raised to 15 (big). Could be a queen, a straight draw (J10), a two pair (Q9), a set (9s?), but set of 9s is impossible because board has 9s, we have no 9. Actually board has 9s, we could have 9x but not. Opp could have 9x for set? Actually set would be 9?? board has one 9, need two 9s in hand. He could have 9? He could have 9? He could have 9? Actually there is 9s on board, there are three 9s in deck. He could have two 9s, giving set. That's possible. He could also have Q? top pair. He could have straight draws like J10, or 7-6 for open-ended? Board 8-9-Q, a 7-6 gives 6-7-8-9-Q not straight. So not.\n\nOur hand is weak. Turn is 2d. Does that change? Not much.\n\nWe have 183 chips, opponent Kimi-K2 has 176 chips. Both similar stacks. Pot 45. Opp hasn't acted yet on turn. It's our action after opponent's turn? Actually order: On turn, seat 5 (us) is first? The order: BB is seat5, seat1 is UTG? Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2. On flop, we bet first, then seat1 raised, then we called. So on turn, seat5 (us) is first to act because seat1 is left of us? Actually order is clockwise from dealer. BB is seat5, seat1 is after seat5? Not sure. But given actions: \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning it's our turn and no bet yet. So we have option to check or raise. Minimum raise to 11 (so raise must be at least 11 total). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot call because no bet.\n\nWe need decide: likely we should check and maybe fold later if bet. Raising could be bluff. Our hand is weak, but we could attempt a semi-bluff to take pot. Opponent likely has strong hand; raising could be called and we lose chips. However we have decent stack and could attempt a steal? But board is not particularly scary (no Ace). Opp could have Q, 9, etc. If we raise, opponent may call with many hands, causing us to lose more.\n\nThus best is to check, see opponent action. If opponent bets, we can decide to call or fold based on size. Since we have no strong hand, we likely fold to any bet.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReasoning: weak hand, opponent likely strong, preserve stack.\n\nReturn JSON."

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: we are BB with TdKd. Board Qs 9s 8h 2d. Pot 45. Opponent Kimi-K2 (Seat1) raised on flop after our flop bet. Let's reconstruct: Preflop we raised to 6 (BB raise). Opponent called 6. Flop: we bet 4 (small). Opponent raised to 15 (so 11 more). We called 11. So pot after flop call: initial pot 45? Actually given pot 45 at turn start. So after flop actions, pot is 45.\n\nNow turn card is? Not given yet; we are at turn decision, board currently Qs 9s 8h 2d, turn unknown yet? Actually board shows Qs 9s 8h 2d (that's 4 cards). So turn is 2d. So we have TdKd, board: Qs 9s 8h 2d. Our hand: Ten of diamonds and King of diamonds. We have a gutshot? Let's see possible draws: Straight draws: we have K, T. Board: Q,9,8,2. We have K and T, so possible straight combos: 10-J-Q-K? Actually we have T, board Q,9,8: we have open-ended? Let's list: 8-9-10-J-Q would be a straight if we had J. We have T, need J. So we have gutshot to straight (need J). Also we have K high, no pair. So currently we have just King high, no pair, no flush (two diamonds, board has no diamond). So we are likely behind.\n\nOpponent's range: He called preflop, then raised on flop after our small bet. He likely has strong hand: maybe top pair Q, or a set (9s?), but board has Qs 9s 8h. He raised to 15 (big). Could be a queen, a straight draw (J10), a two pair (Q9), a set (9s?), but set of 9s is impossible because board has 9s, we have no 9. Actually board has 9s, we could have 9x but not. Opp could have 9x for set? Actually set would be 9?? board has one 9, need two 9s in hand. He could have 9? He could have 9? He could have 9? Actually there is 9s on board, there are three 9s in deck. He could have two 9s, giving set. That's possible. He could also have Q? top pair. He could have straight draws like J10, or 7-6 for open-ended? Board 8-9-Q, a 7-6 gives 6-7-8-9-Q not straight. So not.\n\nOur hand is weak. Turn is 2d. Does that change? Not much.\n\nWe have 183 chips, opponent Kimi-K2 has 176 chips. Both similar stacks. Pot 45. Opp hasn't acted yet on turn. It's our action after opponent's turn? Actually order: On turn, seat 5 (us) is first? The order: BB is seat5, seat1 is UTG? Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2. On flop, we bet first, then seat1 raised, then we called. So on turn, seat5 (us) is first to act because seat1 is left of us? Actually order is clockwise from dealer. BB is seat5, seat1 is after seat5? Not sure. But given actions: \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning it's our turn and no bet yet. So we have option to check or raise. Minimum raise to 11 (so raise must be at least 11 total). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot call because no bet.\n\nWe need decide: likely we should check and maybe fold later if bet. Raising could be bluff. Our hand is weak, but we could attempt a semi-bluff to take pot. Opponent likely has strong hand; raising could be called and we lose chips. However we have decent stack and could attempt a steal? But board is not particularly scary (no Ace). Opp could have Q, 9, etc. If we raise, opponent may call with many hands, causing us to lose more.\n\nThus best is to check, see opponent action. If opponent bets, we can decide to call or fold based on size. Since we have no strong hand, we likely fold to any bet.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReasoning: weak hand, opponent likely strong, preserve stack.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Let's compute: Preflop: BB raised 6, K1 called 6 => pot 12 + blinds 3? Actually SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then raise to 6 (BB) means BB added 4 more? Usually raise to 6 means total contribution 6 from BB. So pot after preflop: SB 1, BB 6, K1 6 =13. Flop: BB bet 4, K1 raise to 15 (total 15), BB call 11 (so BB puts additional 11). So flop pot: previous 13 + 4 + 15 + 11 = 43? Wait need to track: after flop betting, contributions: BB 4+11=15 total on flop, K1 15. So added 30. Pot now 13+30=43. Turn: BB checked, K1 bet 22. So pot before turn bet = 43. K1 bet 22, now pot 65. Amount to call 22, min raise 44.\n\nOur hand TdKd: we have gutshot straight draw? Board Qs 9s 8h 2d. Our hand: Ten of diamonds and King of diamonds. We have open-ended straight draw? Actually we have 8-9-10-J-Q? No J missing. We have K and T. Board has Q,9,8,2. So we have gutshot to straight: need J for 8-9-10-J-Q? Actually we have 10, board 8,9,Q => need J for straight 8-9-10-J-Q. That's a gutshot (one card). Also we have backdoor flush draws? Both diamonds, board has no diamonds, so any two diamonds would give flush but only one diamond on board? Actually board has no diamonds, so we have two diamonds in hand, need three more diamonds on turn and river to make flush, unlikely.\n\nWe also have top pair? No. We have K high, but board top is Q. So we have K kicker but not a pair.\n\nThus our hand is weak. Opponent bet 22 on turn. What is opponent likely? He raised on flop after our bet. Flop board: Qs 9s 8h. He raised to 15 after our 4 bet. He could have Q, 9, 8, straight draws, two pair, etc. Turn 2d (no spade). He bets 22.\n\nWe have to decide fold, call, raise. Likely fold. But consider pot odds: pot before turn bet = 43. Opponent bet 22, pot now 65. To call 22 to win 65, pot odds ~ 22/65 = 0.338 => need ~33% equity. Our hand: we have gutshot 4 outs (J) plus maybe backdoor flush (2 diamonds in hand, need two diamonds on river). But immediate outs are J of any suit (4 outs). However some J's may be blocked by opponent's holdings? But approximate equity: 4 outs out of unknown remaining 46 cards = ~8.7% chance to hit on river. Not enough. So fold.\n\nConsider possibility of raising as bluff? Our stack 183, we could raise to 44 min. But we have weak hand, opponent likely strong, raising may be called and we lose more. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So we have gutshot straight draw (J would give straight), plus backdoor flush draw (two diamonds on board, we have none). Also we have a pair? No, we have T, not on board. So we have open-ended? Actually board Q-9-8, we have T, which is between 9 and Q? T is between 9 and J? Straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K? We have T, need J and K for higher straight. Also 8-9-10-J-Q? We have T, need J. So we have gutshot to both? Actually we have a gutshot: need J for both combos. So one-card runner (J) gives straight. Also we have a backdoor flush possibility (need two diamonds). Not strong.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) is the only remaining player; they bet 2 into pot 6 (so pot before bet 6, they bet 2 making pot 8). So they are betting small. Could be continuation bet with overcards (QJ? maybe). Could be a weak hand, maybe a draw. We have 181 chips, stack large relative to pot. Minimum raise is 4 (total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on opponent tendencies: recall shows they have called preflop once (hand 3) and then checked flop, bet turn and river. Not much data. In hand 3, they called preflop 5 (maybe a decent hand) and then checked flop (maybe weak). In other hands they fold preflop. So they might be tight? Not enough.\n\nGiven we have a weak hand, likely best to fold. But could consider calling to see cheap flop turn? Pot odds: call 2 to win pot 8+2=10? Actually pot after bet is 8, call 2 makes pot 10, we get 2/10 = 20% equity needed. Our hand has maybe ~12% chance to hit straight on turn (1/47 ~2.1%? Actually turn unknown). Wait we have only one card to improve: J for straight, also backdoor flush: need diamond on turn and river (2 cards). Probability to hit straight on turn: about 2 outs? Actually J's 4 outs, but some may be diamonds? J\u2666 also gives flush draw? Not needed. So approx 4 outs out of remaining 47 = 8.5% to hit straight on turn. If miss, could still have backdoor flush: need diamond on turn (2 diamonds left? Actually board has 2 diamonds, we have none, remaining diamonds = 13-2=11. So 11 outs for diamond on turn, then another diamond on river (10 remaining). Probability of two diamonds: (11/47)*(10/46)=~5.1%. So total equity maybe ~8.5%+5% = 13.5% approximate. That's less than 20% needed, so call not profitable.\n\nRaise? Raising to 4 would be a small raise; but we have weak hand, not good.\n\nThus fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Calling with Ace low can be okay if we think opponent will check behind? But we are in SB, after BB and MP called, it's likely the BB will check or maybe raise later.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: SB with A\u26634\u2666. Board: 2c 9c 4h. So we have top pair (pair of 4s) with Ace kicker, plus a backdoor flush draw (clubs) but only one club on board, we have Ace of clubs, so we have nut flush draw? Actually board has 2c and 9c, we have Ac, so we have two clubs, need two more clubs to make flush. Not immediate. Also we have a gutshot? Straight? 4-5-6-7-8? Not.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 called preflop (call 2) from BB? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, they are in BB? Wait seat 1 is Kimi-K2 (BB). Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, they called 2 (big blind) preflop, meaning they are in UTG? Actually positions: SB seat5, BB seat1, seat2 is UTG? Not sure. But we have only two players: SB and BB? Actually seat1 is BB, seat4 called preflop, so seat4 is in UTG (maybe MP). So we have a multi-way? But only seat4 and seat5 are active. So it's heads-up post-flop.\n\nStack sizes: MiniMax-M2 has 212 chips. Pot 6. We are SB with 179.\n\nWe have top pair, but board is paired? No pair on board: 2c 9c 4h. We have 4h on board, we have 4d, so we have pair of 4s.\n\nOpponent's tendencies: from recall: they have called preflop with 5 chips (hand 3), then checked flop, bet turn 4, bet river 4. They also in hand 8 called preflop 1, bet flop 2. So they seem to be willing to bet on flop with maybe draws or weak hands. Not too aggressive.\n\nNow current situation: It's our turn after BB checked? Actually actions: preflop: seat5 post sb 1, seat1 post bb 2, seat4 call 2, seat5 call 1, seat1 check. So after preflop, seat1 (BB) checked. Now flop: we are SB, seat4 (MiniMax-M2) is still to act? Actually order: after flop, action starts with first active player left of button? In heads-up SB is first to act preflop, but postflop the order is SB first? Actually in heads-up, the dealer (SB) is first to act preflop, but after flop the SB is first to act. So seat5 acts first. But the log says \"Amount to call: 0\". So it's our turn, we can check or raise. Opponent hasn't acted yet.\n\nWe have top pair, decent hand. Pot is 6. Minimum raise to 2 (so raise to 2 total? Actually raise to 2 chips total, meaning bet 2). That's a small raise (size about 1/3 pot). Could also check and see what opponent does.\n\nGiven opponent may bet on flop with weak draws, we could check and induce a bet, then call or raise. But we also have decent hand, we could lead out to protect against draws. The board has two clubs; opponent could have club draws. Raising may fold out draws? A small raise might be called by draws.\n\nStack depth: we have 179, opponent 212, pot 6. We can bet ~2-3. Could also check.\n\nGiven we have top pair but vulnerable to overpairs (like 99, 22) and flush draws. But opponent's range includes many hands: could have 2c9c, 9c9x, 2c2x, etc. Our Ace kicker is good. So raising is okay.\n\nI think raise to 4 (total 4) maybe? Minimum raise is to 2, but we can raise bigger. However we need to consider tournament stack preservation. But we have big stack relative to blinds.\n\nThus I will raise to 4 chips (total). Reason: protect, get value.\n\nLegal actions: raise is allowed.\n\nThus output.",

Pocket pairs 7s are medium strength; in early stage with deep stacks, raising is common for value and to isolate. Opponent in SB is Kimi-K2 Thinking, who has shown both calls and folds, also raised to 6 in some hands (maybe 3BB). Their behavior seems mixed; they sometimes raise, sometimes fold, sometimes call. Since they are SB (tight? unknown). Our stack is deep enough to raise. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., 2 more). Usually we could raise to 6-8 to isolate. However, we must consider tournament stage: 93 BB, still early, can be aggressive. The SB's stack is 221 chips (111.5 BB). They have more chips. Raising may get them to fold if they are tight, but they have raised before. Could also just call to see flop cheap. With pocket sevens, set mining is possible but not huge; calling 2 chips for a 3 chip pot is good odds (2 to call, pot 3+2=5? Actually pot currently 3 chips (SB+BB+our call? Wait pot before our action: SB 1, BB 2, total 3. To call we need 2 more, making pot 5). Pot odds ~40% to hit set (approx 12% chance). So call is okay. Raising could build pot if we hit set, but also risk bigger loss if we get called and lose.\n\nGiven opponent's mixed behavior, a raise to maybe 6 (3BB) could be good. Minimum raise is 4 (i.e., total 4). But raise to 6 would be 3 additional chips (total 6). Is that allowed? Minimum raise to is 4, so raise must be at least 4 total. We can raise to any amount above that (subject to stack). Raising to 6 seems fine.\n\nConsider risk: If they call, pot becomes 3+ (our raise 6-2?) Wait we raise to 6 total, meaning we put 6 chips in, they already have 2 (BB) and 1 (SB). So they'd need to call 4 more (if they call). That would be a 9 chip pot preflop (1+2+6). If they re-raise, we may be in trouble.\n\nGiven we have a decent pair, I'd raise to 6 to try to isolate and get value. Reasoning: we want to build pot with a medium pair, and SB may fold or call; if they call we have good equity.\n\nThus decision: raise to 6.\n\n",

We are on button, we raised preflop to 6, opponent called 4 (so pot 13 includes blinds 1+2+6+4? Actually blinds 1+2 =3, our raise 6 adds 6, opponent call 4 adds 4, total 13). Flop: opponent checked. We have a very strong hand, set of sevens, top set? Board: 7,5,10. No higher pair on board, but there is a possible straight draw: 8-9 gives open-ended straight draw? Board: 7-5-10, the straight possibilities: 6-8? Actually need 6-8 for straight: 6-8-9-10? Let's list combos: With board 7,5,10, the possible straight draws: 6-8 gives 6-7-8-9-10? No 9 missing. Actually need 6-8-9? Let's compute: 6-8-9? Not. Let's think: Straight requires 5 consecutive ranks. With board 5-7-10, you could have 6-8-9? Not present. The board has 5,7,10. To have a straight, you need either 6-8-9? Not possible because need 5 cards. For example, if you have 8-9, you have 5-7-8-9-10? That's missing 6. So not a straight. The only possible straight draws are with 8-9? Actually 6-8? Let's enumerate: board ranks: 5,7,10. Potential straight combos:\n\n- 6-8: would give 5-6-7-8-? need 9 or 4? Not there. So no.\n\n- 8-9: gives 5-7-8-9-10 missing 6. No.\n\n- 4-6: 4-5-6-7-? need 8. Not there.\n\nThus board is not connected; no straight draw. However, there is a possible flush draw? Suits: 7d (diamond), 5s (spade), Tc (club). No two of same suit, so no flush draw. So we have a monster hand, likely best. Opponent checked, we can bet for value. Minimum raise is 4 (to total 4? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in? The legal actions: raise to at least 4? But we already have 0 to call. The pot is 13. We could bet 4 (which is a raise to 4 total). That seems small but fine. We could raise bigger for value. Opponent stack 190, we have 181. Likely they have a decent hand like top pair (T) or maybe a draw. We want to extract value. Since we are BTN, we can bet around half pot to pot? Minimum raise is 4, which is about 30% pot. Might want to raise more, maybe to 20-30 chips. But need to be within legal raise range: raise must be at least 4 and at most our stack? Usually raise can be any amount above min. So we can raise to say 30. That would be a bet of 30. Reasonable. We want to maximize value but not scare away. Opponent may call with T, 5, 10, maybe 7? Actually they can't have 7 because we have both sevens. So they could have Ten, maybe 10x, maybe 5x, maybe flush draws? No. So they might call with T, maybe 10-? So we can bet larger.\n\nGiven tournament early stage? Stack 90 BB, not huge but fine. So we can bet maybe 20-30. Let's choose raise to 30.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 30.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

QJ suited is a decent hand, especially suited connectors, but QJ offsuit? It's Qc Js, suited (clubs). So QcJs suited. In early position raise of 3bb (6 total) from UTG? Actually seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2, unknown position (Seat 3 is after SB and BB, so seat 3 is UTG? Seats: seat 1 (UTG?), seat 2 (UTG+1), seat 3 (UTG+2?), but anyway it's early position. Their raise size is 6 (3bb). Our hand is a decent speculative hand, but out of position. With 96 BB stack, we can consider 3-bet? Usually QJ suited is a marginal 3-bet candidate. Could call to see flop and try to outplay. In tournament early stage (96 BB), we can be a bit looser. The opponent's raise size is standard. We need to consider opponent's tendencies: they raised 6 previously twice (hand #3 and #17) and also raised 18 in hand #2 (maybe larger stack). No info on fold/call. Could be a standard raise.\n\nGiven we have 96 BB, calling 4 adds 4 to pot, pot becomes 13 (9+4). Implied odds? QJ suited can flop a lot of strong draws. Out of position, but can see cheap flop. Probably call is fine. Raising to 10 (minimum raise) would be a 5bb raise total, 4bb more. That would be a 3-bet of 5bb (2.5bb more than original raise). That's a bit small for 3-bet, but could be okay as a semi-bluff. However, our hand is not premium enough to 3-bet for value, and we risk being 4-beted. So better to call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nWe must output JSON.\n\n",

So we have just high cards. Opponent likely has something. They raised preflop, could have many combos: broadways, suited connectors, etc. On flop, they may continuation bet. But we have no action yet: amount to call is 0? Wait legal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call is 0, meaning opponent hasn't bet yet? Actually we are first to act on flop? The actions list only shows preflop. On flop, maybe it's our turn to act first (since they raised preflop, they are first to act postflop). But amount to call 0 indicates they haven't bet yet. So we can check or raise. Should we check? With weak hand, likely check and hope they also check. If they bet, we can consider folding. Raising may be a bluff but we have 94 BB, deep stack. Opponent stack 193 chips, about 96 BB. Raising could be a steal? But we are out of position (BB vs opponent in earlier position). Actually we are in BB, they are seat3 (maybe UTG). On flop, action goes to seat3 first (since they were the raiser preflop). But we see amount to call 0, maybe they checked. So we have option to check or raise. With Qc Js, no equity, maybe check. Could also raise as a semi-bluff? Not much draws. So check is best.\n\nThus output: action check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide preflop action with 8d Jh in SB vs BB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) who posted 2 big blind. SB posted 1, so SB is first to act after BB. The BB is seat1, stack 213. They have called 2 (big blind). Actually actions: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called 2. So we are SB, amount to call is 1 (to match BB's 2? Actually pot: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, seat4 called 2, so SB's effective is 1, others 2. So to call we need to put 1 more to match the 2 big blind? Yes amount to call = 1. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., total bet 4). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand 8dJh is a decent suited connector? Actually off-suit: 8d Jh, different suits (diamonds and hearts). So not suited. It's a decent hand in SB, but not premium. In early position? SB is early-ish, but only 5 players. Opponent BB may be tight? We have recall of opponent actions: from seat1 (BB) we have a history: many folds preflop, some raises of 6 (i.e., 3bb raise) and a raise of 6 again. So they raise 6 (3bb) sometimes. They also called a preflop raise of 6 (hand 7). They also raise 6 preflop on multiple occasions. They also raise 6 preflop on hand 13, 16. So they seem to be a somewhat aggressive preflop raiser (3bb). They also sometimes check and fold. They are not overly tight. They also made a raise of 6 preflop and then check flop, etc.\n\nGiven that they are BB and have just posted blind, they have not yet acted. Our decision: call 1 to see flop cheap, or raise to 4 to try to isolate? With 8Jh, it's a decent hand to see flop, especially in SB with 93 BB. Raising to 4 (total 4) would be a 2bb raise (since blind is 2). Actually minimum raise to 4 means raise to total 4 chips (i.e., 2bb raise). That is a small raise. Could be a steal? But we are SB, not a steal position because BB is already forced blind. However raising can isolate the BB and maybe also seat4 (who called) if they are still in? Actually seat4 already called 2, so they are in the pot. If we raise to 4, seat4 would need to call extra 2 to match. That might fold them, isolating us vs BB.\n\nGiven hand strength, 8Jh is not a premium hand, but can flop many straights and combos. In tournament early stage, we have deep stack (93 BB). We could call and see flop cheaply. But also we risk being out of position post-flop (we are first to act preflop, but after flop, position is after BB and seat4? Actually SB is first to act preflop, after flop the order is from UTG? In 5-handed, positions: SB, BB, UTG (seat4?), etc. Actually seat numbers: seat5 is SB, seat1 BB, seat4 is UTG? Not sure. But after flop, action starts with UTG (seat4) then BB then SB. So SB will be last to act post-flop (i.e., in position). That's good. So calling is fine.\n\nGiven opponent BB's tendency to raise 6 preflop, but they haven't yet raised. They just posted blind. So they might be passive now. So calling is likely fine.\n\nThus I think we call 1.\n\nWe must output JSON.",

Preflop: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, MiniMax called 2, SB called 1, BB checked. So flop action: after check from BB (seat1), it's now our turn (SB). Actually order: SB is seat5, after BB (seat1) checked, it's SB's turn. No bet yet. So amount to call 0, can check or raise.\n\nHand: 8d Jh, board Qs 6h 2d. No pair, no straight draw? Let's see: we have gutshot? 8-J: need 9-10 for straight? Actually 8-J: possible open-ended? With Q,6,2, we have gutshot to 9-10? 8-9-10-J-Q would be straight, need 9 and 10. Two cards needed. So no immediate draw. Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Suits: board has spades, hearts, diamonds. Our cards: 8d (diamond) and Jh (heart). So we have one diamond, one heart. Could get backdoor flush but low chance.\n\nOpponent likely has range: they called preflop from BB (big blind) after SB called. So they could have a wide range: any pair, broadway, suited connectors, etc. Board Qs 6h 2d is relatively dry. Our hand is weak. Should we check? Likely yes. Raising could be a bluff but we have a short stack? Actually we have 93 BB, deep enough. But opponent's stack similar.\n\nCheck likely best. Could also consider a small raise to steal? But opponent might have Qx or other strong hands. Raising could get called and we lose. So check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Should we fold? Usually 2J is a very weak hand, dominated by many hands, and not suited. In a tournament with 93 BB, you can afford to be selective. Likely fold.\n\nCheck if opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (seat1 small blind) and seat2 big blind. The big blind is Kimi-K2 as well (same name). Actually seat2 is Kimi-K2 (BB). Seat1 also Kimi-K2 (SB). Both same name? Possibly same player? Might be two bots with same name. We have recall of raise patterns: they raised preflop to 6 (i.e., 3x BB) in hands #2 and #6. So they can be aggressive. But they are in BB now, they have already posted 2. If we call 2, we will see flop out of position. With 2J offsuit, not good. Could consider a steal? But we are BTN, we can raise to steal blinds. But hand is weak; raising might get called or 3-bet? However, we have deep stacks; maybe we can raise to try to steal. But 2J is not a typical stealing hand; better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

No other raises, so we can call 16 (total 20) or raise to at least 28. QJ suited is a decent hand in CO, especially suited connectors. In a tournament with 46.5 BB, we have decent stack, can play aggressively. Need to consider opponent's tendencies; we have no data. MiniMax-M2 raised from MP? Actually seat 4 is MP? Seats: 1 UTG? Not sure but seat 4 is after BB? In 5-player table, positions: Seat1 UTG, Seat2 SB, Seat3 BB, Seat4 CO? Wait seat5 is us CO, so seat4 is MP? Actually with 5 players: Seat1 UTG, Seat2 SB, Seat3 BB, Seat4 UTG+? Actually order: after BB is UTG (seat1), then CO (seat5). But seat4 is before CO, so it's MP? Anyway raise size 16 is 4x big blind, standard. QJ suited is a good hand to 3-bet or call? With 46 BB, could 3-bet to isolate and build pot. But opponent unknown. Could also call to see flop. Considering raise to 28 would be 7 BB, maybe okay. But we need to consider stack depth: 46 BB, we can afford. 3-betting could gain fold equity. QJ suited can flop strong draws. I think a 3-bet is reasonable. However we lack info on opponent's 3-bet tendencies. Could be a tight player? If they raise, they likely have strong hand, so 3-bet could be risky. But QJ suited can still play well.\n\nGiven tournament, we want chip accumulation but also preserve. I think raising to 28 (total) is good to apply pressure. Let's do raise.\n\n",

So we are first to act preflop UTG.\n\nWe need to decide fold/call/raise. Pocket pairs low (3s) are marginal. At UTG early position, typical strategy is to fold unless deep stacks and good implied odds. Stack is 39.5 BB, not huge but decent. Raising would be to 8 min raise (so 4 call, raise to 8 total). That would be a 2 BB raise. Could also raise more. But typical UTG range is tight: AA-99, AK, AQ maybe. 33 is too weak to open UTG in tournament with 39 BB. So likely fold.\n\nBut consider opponents: We have recall of opponent raises: Many raises of 6 (1.5 BB) from Kimi-K2, DeepSeek, etc. MiniMax raised to 16 (4 BB) and 65 (16.25 BB) in other hands. So they may be capable of larger raises. But we are UTG; if we raise, we may get re-raises from them, risking our stack.\n\nThus best to fold.\n\nCheck if any reason to call? Call would be 4 to see flop. With 33, you have set odds: probability of hitting set on flop ~ 11.8% (12%). Pot after call: pot 6 + 4 = 10. If you hit set, you win likely big pot. Expected value: 0.118 * win large pot vs 0.882 * lose 4. Not good given deep stack? Let's compute: If you hit set, expected win maybe about 30 chips? Not sure. Likely negative.\n\nThus fold.\n\nProvide JSON.\n\n",

Calling the 4\u2011chip bet would leave us out of position post\u2011flop with a marginal hand, while a raise also protects our stack and gives us a chance to win the pot outright.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have Qc Jd on button, stacks 160 vs 212 and 179. Blinds 2/4, pot 6. SB 2, BB 4. It's our turn after SB and BB posted. Amount to call is 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise by at least 4 more). We need decide.\n\nWe have QJ offsuit. Position button. Stack 40 BB, decent stack. Opponents: seat1 (SB) Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 (BB) Kimi-K2. Both have similar stacks ~200. From recall, Kimi-K2 Thinking raises preflop 6 (i.e., to 6 total? Actually raise amount 6 maybe meaning raise to 6? In previous hands they raised to 6 from 4? That would be a min raise of 2? Not sure. But pattern: they raise preflop 6 often, which is a 2 BB raise (from 4 to 6). So they are likely to raise smallish.\n\nWe are on button with Qc Jd. QJ suited would be stronger; offsuit is moderate. In a 9-player? Actually 5 seats? Only 2 opponents left (SB and BB). So it's heads-up? Actually there are 5 seats total, but 2 folded, leaving 3 players: SB, BB, BTN. So it's 3-way.\n\nGiven we are button, we can open raise. QJ offsuit is a decent hand for button in 3-handed, but also could call a raise. However we face a bet of 4 (big blind). The pot is 6, effective stack 160. If we raise to 8 (minimum), that's 8 total, raising 4 more. That would be a 2 BB raise. That seems small; maybe better to raise more to isolate. With 40 BB stack, we could raise to say 20 chips (5 BB). But legal actions only include raise, not specify max. We can raise to any amount up to stack.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: SB tends to raise preflop to 6 (i.e., 2 BB) sometimes. BB also maybe call. If we raise to 8, they may call. We could also just call 4 and see flop. But calling with QJ off is okay in 3-way? Might get in trouble with overcards. But we have position.\n\nGiven tournament stage unknown, but stack 40 BB is decent, we can be aggressive. QJ offsuit has decent equity vs random, but not great vs strong. I think raise to 12 (3 BB) to isolate and build pot. But need to consider minimum raise is 8; we can raise to 12.\n\nWe should check opponent stacks: both have >200, so they can call. If they both call, pot will be 4 (our call) + 4 (SB) + 4 (BB) = 12 before raise. Actually currently SB posted 2, BB posted 4, pot 6. If we call 4, pot 10. If we raise to 12, we add 8 more (total 12). Then they'd need to call 8 more. Might be okay.\n\nGiven QJ off, I'd raise to 12 to try to take pot, but also consider that QJ offsuit is not premium, but in 3-handed it's okay. I think raise.\n\nThus action: raise to 12. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

So we face a 3-bet. Amount to call is 16 (20-4). Minimum raise to 28 (i.e., raise 8 more). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. QQ is strong, but 3-bet from seat 4 (position? seat 4 is CO? Let's map: Seats: 1,2,3,4,5 (us BB). SB is seat 4? Wait seat 4 posted sb 2. Actually preflop actions: Seat 4 post_sb 2 (so seat 4 is SB). Seat 5 post_bb 4 (us). So seat 3 is UTG? Seat 3 raise 12 (so from UTG). Seat 4 (SB) re-raises to 20 (so 3-bet from SB). So we have a 3-bet from SB after UTG opened.\n\nOur stack 162, pot 36 + 12 + 20? Actually pot after actions: blinds 2+4 =6, UTG raise 12 (so adds 12 more, total pot 18?), Actually preflop: after blinds posted, pot = 6. UTG raises to 12 (so adds 12-2? Wait UTG's raise amount is 12 total, meaning he puts 12 chips (including call of 2). So extra 10 chips. So pot = 6 + 10 = 16? Let's not worry.\n\nNow SB 3-bet to 20 (total). So we face 16 to call.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 raises small (6) often, but this time raised to 12 maybe a bit larger. MiniMax-M2 has raised 16 and 65 in previous hand, showing willingness to 3-bet bigger. Could be strong.\n\nGiven QQ, we should consider 4-bet or call. Stack 162, effective stack after call would be about 146. 4-betting could isolate and get value, but risk if opponent has AA or KK. But we have QQ, good hand to 4-bet. Minimum raise to 28, which is only 8 more (so total 28). That's a small 4-bet size relative to pot (pot before our action: 4 (our blind) + 12 (UTG) + 20 (SB) = 36? Actually pot is 2+4+12+20 = 38? Wait the posted amounts: SB posted 2 (but then also contributed to the raise?), SB posted 2, then later raises to 20, meaning he adds 18 more (total 20). BB posted 4. UTG raised to 12 (adds 10 extra). So total chips in pot before our decision: SB 20, BB 4, UTG 12 = 36. Yes pot = 36.\n\nIf we call 16, pot will be 36+16=52, we have 146 left. If we 4-bet to 28 (total), we add 24 more (since we already have 4 in pot). So we invest 24, pot becomes 36+24=60, and opponent must call 8 more (to 28) or raise.\n\nGiven typical 4-bet sizing: with deep stacks, 4-bet to around 2.5-3x the 3-bet. Here 3-bet is 20, so 4-bet maybe 50-60. But min raise is only 28, which is small; we could go all-in for 162 if we think we are ahead. But maybe better to call and see flop, as we have good equity vs many ranges.\n\nBut tournament stage: we have 162 chips, relatively short (40 BB). So preserving stack is important, but also we need chips. QQ is strong. A 4-bet could get us all-in against a 3-bet range that includes many hands. If opponent 3-bet is wide, we are likely ahead. But if they are tight, they could have AA or KK.\n\nGiven we have a short stack, maybe we should go all-in to maximize equity. But raising to min 28 is not all-in; we could raise all-in (162). Legal actions include raise; we can raise to any amount up to our stack. So we could go all-in.\n\nShould we call? If we call, we risk being outdrawn by AK etc. But we can see flop and maybe fold if out of position. However"

Better to call? However typical strategy: with 49 BB, you can call to see flop and try to outplay. But Q9 offsuit is weak, likely dominated by better queens, and can be dominated by 9x. In BTN, you could consider a 3-bet for value if opponent is loose and raises small, but Q9 is not a premium hand. Most players would fold or call.\n\nWe need opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2's raise amounts: 16, 65, 20. So sometimes raises small (16, 20) and sometimes larger (65). Not clear. Could be a standard raise. Probably not a very tight player.\n\nGiven hand Q9 offsuit, likely fold. But consider call to see flop? The raise is 16, you would be putting 12 more (since you already posted 4? Actually you haven't posted anything; you need to call 16). You have 196 stack, after call you have 180 left.

Effective stack large.\n\nKcJc suited is a decent hand, but not premium. In CO facing raise from MP? Seat 4 is MP (since CO is seat5). Opponent's tendencies: recall shows that MiniMax-M2 has raised preflop amounts 20, 16, also called, folded etc. No clear aggression pattern. Could be standard.\n\nWe must consider pot odds: call 8 to a pot of 14+8? Actually current pot is 14 (blinds) + 8 (their raise) = 22, we call 8 to win 22, pot odds ~ 27% (8/22). Hand equity vs random? KcJc suited vs random ~ 12% vs 2 players? Actually heads-up vs random ~ 12%? Wait KcJc suited vs random hand is about 12-13%? Actually KcJc suited vs random is around 12% equity. That's lower than 27%, so call is not +EV vs random. But opponent may have range narrower than random (maybe 2-3bb openers). In MP, typical opening range maybe 10% (e.g., 22+, A2s+, K9s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T9s, ATo+, KJo+). KcJc is in that range, but as a caller we are ahead of some and behind others. Equity maybe around 45% vs that range? Let's approximate: vs a typical MP opening range, KcJc suited might be about 45% equity. So call is +EV.\n\nRaising? Could 3-bet. With 49BB stack, 3-bet to maybe 24 (minimum raise to 12, but typical 3-bet size 3x raise = 24). That would be a sizable raise, but KcJc suited is a borderline 3-bet hand; could be used as a semi-bluff. Might be okay to call rather than 3-bet.\n\nGiven tournament, preserve stack. I'd call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. So choose call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

So we are first to act (UTG). Amount to call is 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. K9 off-suit is a marginal hand in UTG. Usually you'd fold in early position, especially in a tournament with 47 BB. However we have some information about opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) raising patterns: they have raised preflop amounts of 6 (likely a standard raise to 6, which is 1.5x big blind? Actually big blind is 4, so raise to 6 means 2 extra, which is 1.5 BB raise). Also raised 12 (maybe 3x BB). Also once raised 18 (4.5x BB). So they seem to raise a variety of sizes, possibly aggressive. Not huge data.\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted BB, no info yet.\n\nGiven UTG K9o is not strong enough to open raise. Could call? In UTG, calling the big blind is not typical; you'd either raise or fold. Calling just 4 chips (big blind) is a limp. In tournaments, limping UTG is generally not advisable. So best is to fold.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning: hand weak, early position, risk of being out of position, stack size moderate, opponents may raise.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Wait board has 4c only one 4. We have 4d, so we have a pair of fours (pair). Actually board: 6h, Js, 4c, 2c, 3c. No other 4. So we have a pair of fours, queen kicker. Board also has a flush draw? There are three clubs on board: 4c,2c,3c. Our hand has Qs, not club. So possible opponent could have a flush (clubs) if they have two clubs. Also possible straight? Board: 2,3,4,6,J. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9? Not relevant. Straight draw maybe 5-6-7? Not. So board is relatively low.\n\nOpponent seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is the only opponent left. They are SB? Actually seat1 posted BB 4? Wait seat5 is BB. Seat1 posted SB 2? Actually preflop: seat5 post_sb 2 (so seat5 is small blind). seat1 post_bb 4 (big blind). So seat1 is BB, seat5 is SB. So on river, after turn both checked, we are in SB (first to act? Actually after turn check, on river seat5 is first to act? In order, action proceeds from SB then BB? On each street, the first to act is the player left of the button, but after flop the SB is first. Since both checked on turn, now river, SB acts first. So we have option to bet/raise.\n\nPot is 8 chips, we have 186 stack, deep. Opponent stack 104 chips. We can bet for value or check.\n\nOur hand: pair of fours, likely weak. Opponent could have many combos: maybe Jx, 6x, 2c3c flush draw? Actually flush possible if they have two clubs: any two clubs would make a flush (5 clubs). Board has three clubs: 4c 2c 3c. So any club in hand gives at least a flush? Actually need 5 clubs total. With 2 clubs in hand + 3 on board = 5 clubs, yes flush. So opponent could have a flush. Also could have a straight? Board: 2-3-4-6-J. Straight possible with A-5? Not. 5-6-7-8-9 no. So only possible straight is 2-3-4-5-6 (needs 5). If opponent has a 5, they'd have a straight 2-3-4-5-6. That's possible. So many hands beat us.\n\nOur hand likely worst. So checking is safe. Could we bluff? Opponent may check back with weak hand. But we have little equity. The pot is small, 8 chips. A bet of maybe 4-6 could steal? Opponent may call with any pair like J, 6, etc. But they might have missed clubs and be weak. However risk of being called by flush is high. Since tournament, preserve chips. So best to check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot check if we want to bet? Actually check is allowed. So we choose check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually board has 4c, we have 4d, so we have a pair of fours with queen kicker. Board also has a flush draw? Board: clubs: 4c,2c,3c -> three clubs, plus we have no club. So flush possible for opponent if they have club. Straight possibilities: board 2-3-4-6-J, possible straight draws? 2-3-4-5-6 would be straight if someone has 5. We have no 5. Opponent could have 5x for straight. Also 6-7-8-9-10? No. J-high maybe.\n\nRiver bet of 6 into pot 14, so pot after bet = 20 (14+6). We need to call 6 to win 20, pot odds 6/20 = 30% needed.\n\nOur hand: pair of fours, likely weak. Opponent (Seat1) checked both preflop and flop and turn, then bets small on river. Could be a weak hand, maybe a missed draw, maybe a bluff, maybe a value bet with something like J, 6, maybe a pair of 6s, 3c? Actually board: 6h Js 4c 2c 3c. If opponent has Jx, they'd have top pair J. Might bet small. Could have 6, also pair. Could have 2c 3c for flush draw but missed; maybe they have a club for flush? No, there are 3 clubs on board, need 2 more clubs for flush, they could have two clubs, but they didn't bet earlier. Could be a bluff with missed club draw. Could also have Q? Q on board? No queen not present. So queen is high kicker.\n\nOur stack 186, opponent 98 chips. If we call, we risk 6 chips, small. If we raise, we could try to push them off. Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise total to 12). That would be raise of 6 extra (to 12). Opponent may call or fold. If they have weak hand they'd fold; if they have J they'd likely call? 6 chips call vs pot 14+6+? Actually after raise to 12, pot would be 14+12=26, they'd need to call 6 more. They have 98 chips, could call. Might be okay.\n\nGiven small bet, maybe we should call because pot odds good and we have some showdown value? But we are likely behind many hands. However we have queen kicker, could beat J? No, J beats us. So only hands we beat: lower pairs (2,3,6? Actually we have pair of 4s, we beat 2s,3s, maybe 6s? Wait we have 4s, board has 6, so 6s is higher pair. So we lose to 6s. We beat 2c 3c (two pair? Actually board has 2c and 3c, opponent could have 2c 3c for two pair? That would be 3c and 2c plus board 2c 3c 4c? Actually board has 2c 3c 4c, so if opponent holds 2c 3c they'd have full house? No board has only one each. So they'd have pair of 2s and 3s each? Not possible. So not relevant.\n\nWe beat any hand that is just high card, or lower pair like 2s,3s, maybe 6? No 6 higher. So limited.\n\nGiven small bet and pot odds, call seems okay. But consider tournament: we have 46.5 BB, opponent 98 chips (~24 BB). If we lose 6 chips, still fine. If we call and lose, we lose 6 chips, still fine. If we raise and they fold, we win 6 chips (pot 14+6? Actually we raise, they fold, we win pot 14). That's small gain. If they call, we risk 6 more chips, could lose more.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, best is to call the small bet, maybe even fold? But call seems okay given pot odds and we have some showdown value (pair). Also opponent's bet small could be a probe. I'd call.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null.\n\n",

A modest raise to 8 builds the pot for our strong hand, extracts value from worse tens or sevens, and protects against draws while still being affordable for both stacks.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Board: 7c 7h Th. Our hand: 2h Ts. So we have top pair (tens) with a weak kicker (2). Also we have a backdoor straight draw? Actually with 2 and T, we have pair of tens, plus potential flush draw? We have hearts: 2h and board hearts: none (7c,7h,Th). Only hearts: Th is heart, so we have a flush draw? Actually we have 2h and Th, both hearts, so we have two hearts, board has no hearts. So we have a flush draw (need two more hearts on turn and river). Also we have a pair of tens, but board has pair of sevens. Opponent is Kimi-K2, seat 2, in BB, with 209 chips. He checked flop. We can check or raise. Consider stack sizes: we have 182 chips, opponent 209. Pot 10. Minimum raise is 4 (so raise to 4? Actually raise_to total is 4? Minimum raise to 4 means raise total to 4? Wait, we have already 4 in pot from blinds? Preflop we called 4, opponent posted 4. So pot 10 includes 4+4+2? Actually blinds: SB 2, BB 4, we called 4, so pot 10 (2+4+4). On flop, opponent checked, amount to call 0, min raise to 4 (so raise total to 4). So raising to 4 would be a small raise (bet 4). That is 0.4 BB relative to current BB 4? Actually raise to 4 means total bet 4, which is same as BB amount. So a 4 chip bet.\n\nOur hand is decent but not strong. Opponent's checking could be weak or could be drawing. We have a strong draw (flush) and a pair. Might want to bet to protect against draws and get value from worse hands like 7x, lower pair, etc. But also we could check to see a free card and possibly improve.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: We saw they checked flop 4 times in past. No raises. Likely passive, maybe checks with everything. So we can take initiative.\n\nStack depth: Both have similar stacks, 45 BB vs 52 BB. Not a huge stack. Raising small could set up pot. If we bet 4 (pot sized 10, bet 4 is 0.4 pot). Might get called by worse hands, maybe raise by stronger like a set (7s) or two pair (T7). But we have top pair, we want value. Could also be a trap.\n\nGiven we have a flush draw, we could also bet as semi-bluff. But small bet may not protect.\n\nThus I think raising to 8 (i.e., a bet of 8) could be better, but min raise is 4, but we can raise to any amount up to stack. However we need to ensure raise amount is total, not addition. So raise_to maybe 12? Actually we could raise to 12 (bet 12). But is that allowed? Yes, we can raise to any amount above minimum raise (which is 4). But we need to consider stack: we have 182 chips, opponent 209, so max we can bet is 182 (all-in). But we likely want a modest bet.\n\nGiven we have top pair, we might want to extract value. Opponent may have a weaker ten, or a 7, or a straight draw. A bet of around half pot (5) could be good. Minimum raise is 4, but we could raise to 6 or 8. Let's decide raise to 8 (i.e., bet 8). That is 0.8 pot, decent.\n\nWe need to consider pot odds for opponent: pot 10, bet 8, pot becomes 18, opponent must call 8, pot odds 8/18 ~44%. Might fold weaker draws.\n\nGiven opponent is passive, maybe they will call with any pair, but may fold draws.\n\nI think raising to 8 is reasonable.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 8, reasoning: we have top pair with a flush draw, want value and protect, opponent passive, small raise to build pot.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

But seat numbers: seat5 is us, after SB and BB, UTG would be seat5 indeed. So we are first to act preflop, facing no raise, just need to call 4 to see flop (i.e., complete blind?). Actually amount to call is 4 (big blind). So we can call 4 (i.e., just see flop) or raise.\n\nGiven Kc6c is not a premium hand; calling is okay to see flop but we are out of position (UTG) after SB and BB. In tournament with 48 BB, we may want to preserve chips. Kc6c suited has some flush potential but not great. Could raise to steal? But we are early, many players left, likely to get re-raised. Better to fold maybe? But calling 4 is cheap. However we are out of position; playing speculative hand UTG is risky. Many would fold.

In BB you can check and see flop for cheap, but with such a weak hand, maybe fold? But you already invested 4 (big blind). If you check, you see flop for free. Could be okay to see flop with 8d2d? It's a dead hand, low chance to improve (straight draws possible). Many players would just check and fold later. But could also just fold now to avoid any post-flop trouble. However checking doesn't cost chips; you still have same stack. If you fold you lose the big blind (4). If you check you get a free flop, maybe you can improve. In tournament, preserving chips is important but you already lost 4. So checking is generally standard with any hand in BB when no raise.

So raise amount would be 8 total (i.e., 4 extra). Need to decide.\n\nConsider hand: Qc Kh suited? No, Qc and Kh are offsuit (different suits). It's a decent hand, broadway, could be strong. Position: BTN, can steal blinds. Opponents: Seat1 (SB) and Seat2 (BB). We have info on Seat1 raise patterns: mostly raises of 6 (i.e., 3bb) in earlier hands, one raise of 28 (big) and one raise of 8 (2bb). So SB sometimes raises modestly. Not sure about BB.\n\nWe are facing 4 to call. Pot currently 6 (SB 2 + BB 4). If we raise to 8 (i.e., add 4), pot becomes 12 (if called). Actually raise to 8 total means we put 8 chips, raising 4 more. That would be a small raise (2bb). Could be a standard steal. Our hand QK offsuit is good for steal. Stack 46.5 BB, comfortable.\n\nWe could also consider calling (just limping) but that invites action from BB and SB. Better to raise.\n\nShould we consider a larger raise? Minimum raise is 8. Could raise more, but not given as legal? Legal actions include raise (any raise above min). We could raise to larger amount, but typical steal raise maybe 3bb (12). But we have only 4 to call, min raise to 8 is 2bb total. Actually 2bb raise is small, might be considered a \"limp-raise\"? Not typical. But we can raise bigger, like to 12 or 14.\n\nGiven opponent SB sometimes raises 6 (3bb) preflop, they may be aggressive. If they raise, they likely have strong hand. But we are acting now before them. If we raise to 8, SB may call or fold. If they call, BB may also call. Our hand QK offsuit can still be good.\n\nGiven stack size, we can afford a standard raise of 12 (3bb). That would be raise_to 12. Is that allowed? Minimum raise to 8, so raise_to 12 is fine. Should we raise to 12? Might be better to apply pressure.\n\nThus decision: raise to 12. Reason: good hand, position, steal, opponent tendencies.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have Qc Kh on BTN. Preflop: we raised to 12 (3BB). Seat1 (Kimi) re-raised to 30 (7.5BB). Now we face a 18 call to 30 (i.e., we need to call 18 more to match 30). Minimum raise to 48 (i.e., raise to 48 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength, position (BTN), stack 174 chips (43.5 BB). Effective stack: opponent has 82 chips (20.5 BB). So we are deeper relative to opponent. Kimi's behavior: from recall, he sometimes raises preflop (hand 31 raise 28, hand 36 raise 8). So he can be aggressive. He raised to 8 (2BB) earlier, which is small. He also raised to 28 (7BB) in hand 31. He also re-raised us now to 30 (7.5BB). So likely a strong hand, maybe premium or strong broadway.\n\nOur hand Qc Kh: decent, but not premium. In BTN vs SB re-raise, typical action could be 3-bet or fold. But we already raised, now facing a 3-bet (actually a 2-bet after our raise). It's a 3-bet situation. Stack depths: opponent 82, we 174. 3-bet size 30 vs our 12 raise (so 2.5x our raise). That's a standard 3-bet. Our hand QK offsuit is a decent 3-bet candidate but can also call. However, opponent's stack is shallow (20BB). If we call, we will be in a pot of 30+12+2 (SB+BB) = 46? Actually pot currently 46 (as given). If we call, pot becomes 64 (add 18). Opponent's effective stack after call is 82-30=52 chips left. So post-flop, we would be out of position with 52 chips vs our 174-30=144 left (if we call). That is a big stack difference. Could be okay to call with QK but risk of playing out of position.\n\nAlternatively, we could 4-bet (raise to 48). Minimum raise to 48 total, which is a 3BB raise over his 30 (i.e., raise to 48 = additional 18). That's a small 4-bet, about 1.6x his 3-bet. That would be a small 4-bet, maybe as a bluff or semi-bluff. With QK, we could 4-bet as a value raise against a wide 3-bet range. But opponent's stack is short; a 4-bet to 48 would commit 48 chips (27% of his stack). He may call or shove.\n\nWe need to consider tournament: we have 43.5 BB, opponent 20.5 BB. We could try to isolate and win chips. QK is a strong hand, but not as strong as AK, AQ, JJ+. But still ahead of many 3-bet ranges. If opponent is 3-betting wide, we can 4-bet. If tight, maybe just call.\n\nGiven opponent's past raises: hand 31 raise 28 (big) then bet flop big, indicating strong hand. Hand 36 raise 8 (small) maybe a steal. So his 3-bet size 30 could be strong.\n\nThus perhaps best to call and see flop, given we are out of position but have stack advantage. However, calling gives him good implied odds to shove later. A 4-bet could isolate and perhaps win the pot preflop if he folds. If he calls, we go heads-up with a decent hand.\n\nI think 4-bet to 48 is a good move: it's a small 4-bet, but we have deep stack; we could also go all-in? Minimum raise is 48, not all-in. All-in would be 174, too big.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, preserving chips vs a potentially strong opponent: maybe call and see flop, because QK offsuit can flop a straight draw etc. But being out of position is disadvantage.\n\nI lean to raise to 48 (4-bet) as a semi-bluff/value. Reason: isolate, leverage stack advantage, and QK is ahead of many 3-bet ranges.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 48.\n\n",

Actually with A-3-4, we need a 2 or 5 for a straight. With K, we have no pair. We have backdoor flush possibilities with hearts (K\u2665? Actually we have Kh, board has 3h, so we have one heart, need two more hearts). Opponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 50 chips, SB 2. They bet 32 into pot 96 (so pot now 128 after bet). They are short stack, 50 chips left (including bet? Actually stack before bet 50, they bet 32, leaving 18). So they are short. They have 50 chips total, they bet 32, leaving 18. So they could be shoving all-in with a strong hand, but they left 18, could also be a bluff. Their betting pattern unknown; we have some recall of preflop raises: they raised small amounts (6,12,14). They are maybe aggressive. They are in SB, they posted 2, then called? Actually they raised 30 preflop after our raise to 12, they are SB. They raised to 30 (so they 3-bet). Then we called 18 (so we put 30 total? Actually we raised 12, they re-raised to 30, we called 18 to match 30). So they 3-bet preflop, indicating strength. They have a short stack 50 chips, they are in SB. They could have Aces, Kings, maybe suited connectors. On flop Ac 3h 4s, they bet 32 (which is about 2/3 pot). They could be continuation betting with Ace high, a pair of Aces, maybe a set? No set possible because board has only one Ace, one 3, one 4. They could have A2, A5, etc. They could have a gutshot straight draw (2). They could have a flush draw (hearts). They could be semi-bluffing.\n\nOur hand: K\u2665 Q\u2663. We have K high, queen, both overcards to Ace? Actually Ace is on board, so we have Ace-high? No we have K and Q, not Ace. So we have Ace on board, we have no pair. Our hand is weak. However we have a straight draw (need 2 for straight 2-3-4-5-A? Actually A-2-3-4-5 is a wheel straight, but we have no 2, we have KQ. So we need a 2 to make a straight (2-3-4-5? Actually 5 not present, but we need 5 to complete? Let's list combos: board A-3-4. Straight possibilities: A-2-3-4-5 (needs 2 and 5). Or 2-3-4-5-6 (needs 2,5,6). Or 3-4-5-6-7 (needs 5,6,7). So we have only K and Q, not helpful. So we have no straight draw. We have backdoor flush draw hearts: we have K\u2665, board has 3\u2665, need two more hearts on turn and river.\n\nThus our hand is very weak. The opponent likely has a strong hand (Ace, maybe pair of Aces, maybe a set? Not possible). Could have Ace with a kicker, maybe A2, A5, A6, etc. Could have a straight draw like 2-5? Actually 2-5 would give straight draw? 2-5 would give A-2-3-4-5 straight already? Wait board A-3-4, if they have 2-5, they have A-2-3-4-5 which is a straight (wheel). So they could have 2-5 combos. That's possible. So they could have a made straight. Also they could have a flush draw with hearts (like Ah? Actually Ace is on board, they could have Ah? That's Ace of hearts, they'd have flush draw with hearts? Actually board has only one heart, they'd need two hearts in hand for flush draw. So maybe they have hearts.\n\nGiven our weak hand, best to fold. But consider stack: we have 156 chips, opponent short. If we call 32, pot would be 128+32 = 160? Actually pot currently 96, they bet 32 making pot 128, we call 32 making pot 160, we invest 32 to possibly win 160, odds 5:1, need "

Actually we have Kh, board has 3h, so we have one heart, need two more hearts). Opponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 50 chips, SB 2. They bet 32 into pot 96 (so pot now 128 after bet). They are short stack, 50 chips left (including bet? Actually stack before bet 50, they bet 32, leaving 18). So they are short. They have 50 chips total, they bet 32, leaving 18. So they could be shoving all-in with a strong hand, but they left 18, could also be a bluff. Their betting pattern unknown; we have some recall of preflop raises: they raised small amounts (6,12,14). They are maybe aggressive. They are in SB, they posted 2, then called? Actually they raised 30 preflop after our raise to 12, they are SB. They raised to 30 (so they 3-bet). Then we called 18 (so we put 30 total? Actually we raised 12, they re-raised to 30, we called 18 to match 30). So they 3-bet preflop, indicating strength. They have a short stack 50 chips, they are in SB. They could have Aces, Kings, maybe suited connectors. On flop Ac 3h 4s, they bet 32 (which is about 2/3 pot). They could be continuation betting with Ace high, a pair of Aces, maybe a set? No set possible because board has only one Ace, one 3, one 4. They could have A2, A5, etc. They could have a gutshot straight draw (2). They could have a flush draw (hearts). They could be semi-bluffing.\n\nOur hand: K\u2665 Q\u2663. We have K high, queen, both overcards to Ace? Actually Ace is on board, so we have Ace-high? No we have K and Q, not Ace. So we have Ace on board, we have no pair. Our hand is weak. However we have a straight draw (need 2 for straight 2-3-4-5-A? Actually A-2-3-4-5 is a wheel straight, but we have no 2, we have KQ. So we need a 2 to make a straight (2-3-4-5? Actually 5 not present, but we need 5 to complete? Let's list combos: board A-3-4. Straight possibilities: A-2-3-4-5 (needs 2 and 5). Or 2-3-4-5-6 (needs 2,5,6). Or 3-4-5-6-7 (needs 5,6,7). So we have only K and Q, not helpful. So we have no straight draw. We have backdoor flush draw hearts: we have K\u2665, board has 3\u2665, need two more hearts on turn and river.\n\nThus our hand is very weak. The opponent likely has a strong hand (Ace, maybe pair of Aces, maybe a set? Not possible). Could have Ace with a kicker, maybe A2, A5, A6, etc. Could have a straight draw like 2-5? Actually 2-5 would give straight draw? 2-5 would give A-2-3-4-5 straight already? Wait board A-3-4, if they have 2-5, they have A-2-3-4-5 which is a straight (wheel). So they could have 2-5 combos. That's possible. So they could have a made straight. Also they could have a flush draw with hearts (like Ah? Actually Ace is on board, they could have Ah? That's Ace of hearts, they'd have flush draw with hearts? Actually board has only one heart, they'd need two hearts in hand for flush draw. So maybe they have hearts.\n\nGiven our weak hand, best to fold. But consider stack: we have 156 chips, opponent short. If we call 32, pot would be 128+32 = 160? Actually pot currently 96, they bet 32 making pot 128, we call 32 making pot 160, we invest 32 to possibly win 160, odds 5:1, need ",

They just called 8 (big blind) from SB? Actually SB posted 4, BB posted 8, then seat1 and seat2 folded, seat3 called 8 (so they are in the big blind? Wait seat3 is after seat2, so they are UTG? In a 5-player? Actually seats: 1,2,3,4,5. SB is seat4, BB seat5. So seat3 is UTG (under the gun) and they called 8 (big blind). So they are a caller, not raising. Our hand 7s8s is suited connectors, decent for a raise in BB vs a single caller? With 18.5 BB, we could raise to 16 (minimum raise) to try to isolate and maybe steal. 7s8s is a decent hand for a 3-bet? Actually it's a raise, not 3-bet. The opponent just called, we are in BB and they have called. We can check (i.e., just see a flop) or raise. The pot is 20 chips (4+8+8). Raising to 16 would make pot 28, they'd need to call 8 more. Our hand has potential but not premium; we might want to see a cheap flop. However with 18.5 BB, we can afford a raise. Opponent's calling range is likely wide (they called 8). Could be suited connectors, small pairs, etc. Raising could isolate and we have position postflop (we are BB, but after flop we are out of position to the caller? Actually we are in BB and they are UTG, after flop the action will be on them first (since they are earlier seat). So raising gives us initiative but we will be out of position postflop. With 7s8s, being out of position is okay but we need good implied odds. Might just check and see a flop cheap. Stack depth is moderate; we could also raise to apply pressure, but risk folding if they 3-bet? Actually they already called; we can raise now. If they 3-bet (re-raise), they'd need to invest more. But typical play: In BB vs a single caller, raising with suited connectors is okay to try to steal blinds? But the SB already posted, and we are BB. If we raise, we are effectively stealing the pot from UTG. UTG's range is wide; they may fold to raise. So raising could be profitable. Minimum raise is 16 (total). That is 8 more than call. So raise to 16, they'd need to call 8 extra. That is a decent pressure. Considering our hand, 7s8s has decent equity vs random (around 45% vs random). So raising is good.\n\nThus choose raise to 16.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually we have 7-8, board Q-9-J, we have 8,7. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q (need 10) or 7-8-9-10-J (need 10). Actually we need a 10 for both. So we have a gutshot? Wait: 7-8 plus Q-9-J: The possible straight is 8-9-10-J-Q (need 10) and also 7-8-9-10-J (need 10). Both need a 10. So it's a single-card draw (one rank) with 4 outs (10s). Also we have backdoor flush draw? Suits: we have 7s8s, board has Qh 9h Jc, two hearts on board, we have spades, so no flush draw.\n\nOpponent DeepSeek-V3.2 is in seat 3, they called preflop and are now on flop. No actions yet on flop; we are first to act? Actually actions list: preflop actions ended with raise to 16 (BB raised to 16) and seat 3 called 8 (so they called the raise to 16). So pot after preflop: blinds 4+8=12, plus raise 16 total? Let's compute: preflop: SB 4, BB 8, seat3 call 8 (calls BB?), then BB raise to 16 (so adds 8 more), seat3 call 8 (calls raise). So total contributions: SB 4, BB 8+8 raise =16, seat3 8+8 =16. So pot = 4+16+16 =36 indeed.\n\nNow flop: no bets yet. It's our turn (BB) after seat3? Actually seat3 is in position UTG? The order: SB (seat4) is out, BB (seat5) is dealer? Actually seat5 is BB and also dealer? Not sure. But we have the option to check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we could check.\n\nWe have a draw with 4 outs, pot 36, we have 140 stack. Pot odds if we call a bet? Not relevant. We can consider betting to protect against draws and get value if opponent has QJ, etc. Opponent's range: they called a raise from BB preflop from SB? Actually they were in seat3 (UTG maybe) with unknown hand. They called a raise from BB to 16. So they likely have a hand that can call 16 from 208 stack (10% of stack). Could be broadway combos, suited connectors, etc. Board Qh 9h Jc is fairly coordinated. Our hand 7s8s is a gutshot. Might want to check and see if opponent bets, then decide.\n\nConsider tournament stage: stack 140 (~17.5 BB). Not huge but okay. We can try to steal pot by betting. However we have a draw; betting could give us fold equity if opponent has weak queen, etc. But we risk being called and we may be behind.\n\nWhat is opponent tendency? No data. Could recall opponent actions but none found. So assume typical.\n\nGiven we have a draw and not a made hand, checking is often correct to see free card. If opponent bets, we can call with odds: pot 36, bet maybe 16? If they bet 16, pot becomes 52, we need call 16, odds 16/52 = 30.8%. Our draw equity: 4 outs * 2 = 8% on turn, plus maybe backdoor? Actually after turn, we get two cards left; but we just consider immediate odds: If we call now and hit on turn, we have 4 outs, 2 cards left, probability of hitting on turn = 4/47 = 8.5%; if miss, we could still hit on river if another 4 outs remain: probability of hitting by river = 1 - (43/47)*(42/46) approx 4/47 + (43/47)*(4/46) = 8.5% + (91.5% * 8.7%) \u2248 8.5% + 7.96% = 16.5% total. So equity ~16.5% vs 30.8% pot odds, not good. So better to fold if bet is large. If bet is small (e.g., 8), pot odds 8/("

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #43 on flop. Situation: BB with 7s8s, stack 140, blinds 4/8, pot 36. Board Qh 9h Jc. So we have open-ended straight draw (8 gives 8-9-10-J-Q? Actually we have 7-8, board Q-9-J, we have 8,7. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q (need 10) or 7-8-9-10-J (need 10). Actually we need a 10 for both. So we have a gutshot? Wait: 7-8 plus Q-9-J: The possible straight is 8-9-10-J-Q (need 10) and also 7-8-9-10-J (need 10). Both need a 10. So it's a single-card draw (one rank) with 4 outs (10s). Also we have backdoor flush draw? Suits: we have 7s8s, board has Qh 9h Jc, two hearts on board, we have spades, so no flush draw.\n\nOpponent DeepSeek-V3.2 is in seat 3, they called preflop and are now on flop. No actions yet on flop; we are first to act? Actually actions list: preflop actions ended with raise to 16 (BB raised to 16) and seat 3 called 8 (so they called the raise to 16). So pot after preflop: blinds 4+8=12, plus raise 16 total? Let's compute: preflop: SB 4, BB 8, seat3 call 8 (calls BB?), then BB raise to 16 (so adds 8 more), seat3 call 8 (calls raise). So total contributions: SB 4, BB 8+8 raise =16, seat3 8+8 =16. So pot = 4+16+16 =36 indeed.\n\nNow flop: no bets yet. It's our turn (BB) after seat3? Actually seat3 is in position UTG? The order: SB (seat4) is out, BB (seat5) is dealer? Actually seat5 is BB and also dealer? Not sure. But we have the option to check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we could check.\n\nWe have a draw with 4 outs, pot 36, we have 140 stack. Pot odds if we call a bet? Not relevant. We can consider betting to protect against draws and get value if opponent has QJ, etc. Opponent's range: they called a raise from BB preflop from SB? Actually they were in seat3 (UTG maybe) with unknown hand. They called a raise from BB to 16. So they likely have a hand that can call 16 from 208 stack (10% of stack). Could be broadway combos, suited connectors, etc. Board Qh 9h Jc is fairly coordinated. Our hand 7s8s is a gutshot. Might want to check and see if opponent bets, then decide.\n\nConsider tournament stage: stack 140 (~17.5 BB). Not huge but okay. We can try to steal pot by betting. However we have a draw; betting could give us fold equity if opponent has weak queen, etc. But we risk being called and we may be behind.\n\nWhat is opponent tendency? No data. Could recall opponent actions but none found. So assume typical.\n\nGiven we have a draw and not a made hand, checking is often correct to see free card. If opponent bets, we can call with odds: pot 36, bet maybe 16? If they bet 16, pot becomes 52, we need call 16, odds 16/52 = 30.8%. Our draw equity: 4 outs * 2 = 8% on turn, plus maybe backdoor? Actually after turn, we get two cards left; but we just consider immediate odds: If we call now and hit on turn, we have 4 outs, 2 cards left, probability of hitting on turn = 4/47 = 8.5%; if miss, we could still hit on river if another 4 outs remain: probability of hitting by river = 1 - (43/47)*(42/46) approx 4/47 + (43/47)*(4/46) = 8.5% + (91.5% * 8.7%) \u2248 8.5% + 7.96% = 16.5% total. So equity ~16.5% vs 30.8% pot odds, not good. So better to fold if bet is large. If bet is small (e.g., 8), pot odds 8/(",

Also we have gutshot? Actually we have 8-7, board Q J 9, we have open-ended straight draw: need 6 or T to complete straight (6-7-8-9-10? Wait board: Q J 9, we have 8 7, so we have 7-8-9-J-Q, missing 10 for straight (10-J-Q-K-A? Actually need 10 for 7-8-9-10-J? That's a straight 7-8-9-10-J). Also need 6 for 6-7-8-9-10? No board doesn't have 10, so 6 would give 6-7-8-9-? need 5? Actually 6-7-8-9-? need 5? Not. So only 10 gives straight. Wait open-ended? Let's list ranks: we have 7,8; board has 9,J,Q. The sequence 7-8-9-10-J would be straight, missing 10. Also 8-9-10-J-Q would be straight, missing 10 again. So only 10 gives straight, not open-ended but one-card draw (just 10). So it's a gutshot? Actually it's a double gutshot? No it's a single outs: only 4 tens (but some may be dead). So 4 outs, plus maybe backdoor flush? Not likely.\n\nThus hand is weak. Opponent bet 12 into pot 48, pot after bet is 60? Actually pot before bet 48, opponent bet 12, making pot 60 (including bet). To call 12, we need pot odds: call 12 to win 60 (including opponent's bet). So equity needed ~20% (12/60). Our hand equity: with 4 outs, about 4*2 =8% on turn, plus maybe 4*4=16% on river? Actually approximate: chance to hit on turn ~4/46=8.7%; if miss, chance on river ~4/45=8.9%; combined ~16.5% (ignoring turn card that could give extra outs). So about 16-17% chance to make straight, plus maybe some combos that give two pair? Our hand 7-8 with board Q-J-9, we have no pair, could make pair if 7 or 8 hits, but that's not a winning hand likely because opponent may have higher pair. So equity maybe ~15-18%. That's below 20% needed, so fold is correct.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 has bet 7 on flop earlier (hand 18) and 35 (hand 41) - both relatively sized. Could be strong. So folding is appropriate.\n\nWe have stack 140, pot 48, after bet 12, we could raise but not advisable.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have Js9c on button, 17 BB. Opponents: seat1 (SB) 214 chips, seat2 (BB) 141 chips. Both have decent stacks. We are BTN, can act after SB and BB posted. SB posted 4, BB posted 8. No other raises yet. Amount to call is 8 (big blind). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). Hand Js9c is a suited connector but not premium. At 17 BB, we are relatively short. In tournament, with 17 BB, we need to be aggressive, but also consider risk. The opponents have been raising preflop with amounts like 6,12,14,24. They seem to raise varying sizes, perhaps they raise standard 3x BB (12) often. Our hand is marginal; we could consider a raise to steal blinds, but risk being 3-bet caught. Our stack is short, but we could also call and see flop. However calling 8 puts us at 8/136 ~5.9% of stack, leaving 128 behind. That seems okay. But we risk being dominated if flop hits.\n\nGiven Js9c suited, we could raise to 24 (3x BB) to try to steal. But our raise size must be at least 16 total. If we raise to 24, that is a 3-bet (we are raising to 24, which is 3x BB). That would be a standard raise to steal. However, the BB may 3-bet us or call. Since we have short stack, we need to consider if we get called and then we are out of position preflop, but we will be in position post-flop (we are BTN). If we call, we could see flop cheap and potentially hit a straight or flush draw.\n\nGiven our stack 17 BB, we could also consider going all-in (136 chips). That would be a huge raise, but would risk losing all chips if called. Usually with suited connectors and short stack, you might push all-in to maximize fold equity. But with 17 BB, all-in is okay if you think you have fold equity. However opponents may call with better hands.\n\nI think a raise to 24 is reasonable, but maybe we can push all-in (136) to maximize. The legal actions: raise allowed. Minimum raise to 16, we can raise to any amount up to our stack. In short stack, all-in is often advisable with a hand that can win big pots if it hits. Js9c is not top tier, but can win big if it hits. However, with 17 BB, you might want to preserve chips and not commit all unless you think you have enough equity.\n\nGiven opponent tendencies: they have raised 6 (maybe 1.5x BB) earlier, and 12,14,24. They are not overly tight. Might call a raise. So a modest raise to 24 might get called, and then we are out of position preflop but we will be in position post-flop (BTN). If we get called, we will have about 112 behind after raise (24 total, we put 24, we already had 8 call, so we add 16 more). Actually we raise to 24 total, meaning we put 24 chips, which is 16 more than call. So our stack after raise is 136-24 =112. We'll be left with 112 chips, still decent.\n\nIf we call, we will be out of position? Actually after call we are still in position (BTN) because SB and BB are before us, we call 8, then flop. So calling also leaves us with 128 chips. So calling gives us more chips and we see flop cheap. That's probably better. Js9c is a speculative hand, so seeing flop cheap is good.\n\nThus best action: call 8. Reason: short stack, want to see flop cheap, suited connector can hit draws, position advantage.\n\nThus answer: call.",

Given both stacks are short, building the pot now is advantageous.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have flop: board Td 9s Ks. Our hand Js 9c gives us two pair: 9s and 9c? Actually we have a pair of nines (9c and board 9s) plus a jack, and board has Ten, King, Ten? Wait board: Td 9s Ks. So we have pair of 9s and a jack, plus a gutshot? Actually we have a straight draw? Cards: J 9. Board: T 9 K. We have J9, board T9K. So we have a pair of 9s, plus we have a gutshot straight draw: need Q for J-T? Actually straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K would be a straight, we have 9 and J, board has T and K, need Q. So we have open-ended? No, we have 9-J, board T-K, missing Q. So one-card draw.\n\nWe also have a backdoor flush? Suits: Js (spades), 9c (clubs). Board: Td (diamonds), 9s (spades), Ks (spades). Two spades on board, we have Js spade, so we have three spades (Js, 9s, Ks). One more spade on turn/river could give us flush. So potential.\n\nOur opponent Kimi-K2 in BB checked the flop. So they have checked. Their stack 141 chips, they are short (around 17.6 BB). We have 128 chips (16 BB). Both short.\n\nWe need to decide whether to bet/raise or check. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. Raising minimum to 8 (i.e., total 8). Pot is 20.\n\nWe have decent hand but not top pair. Could be behind many hands: Kx, Ax, Qx, maybe a set of 9s? Actually board has 9, we have pair of 9s; opponent could have 9x (set) if they have 9? Actually board has one 9, we have other 9, so set impossible because only two 9s in deck, we have one, board has one, remaining 9 is out. So opponent cannot have set. They could have two pair: Kx (K + something) gives K-K? Actually board has K, they could have Kx for top pair K, but board has K, so they have pair of Kings, that's top pair. Also could have T9 for full house? Actually board T9K, they could have T9 for two pair Tens and Nines, but we have pair of nines, they could have TT for set of tens? Board only one Ten, we could have TT for set of tens, but we don't have. Opponent could have TT (set) but board has only one Ten, they would need two Tens, impossible. So opponent could have Kx (pair of Kings), QJ for straight draw, or QK for top pair K with kicker Q. Also could have A? Not strong.\n\nGiven we have two pair (9s and J? Actually we have pair of 9s plus a jack high). That's decent but not best.\n\nCheck-raise possibility? Raising could extract value from worse hands (like Kx, T9, QJ draws). But also could be called by stronger hands (Kx). Since opponent checked, maybe they have weak hand or drawing. We can bet to protect against draws and get value.\n\nOur stack is short; raising 8 (total) puts 8 more into pot, making pot 28. Opponent can call 8, leaving them 133 chips left, still enough.\n\nWe need to consider tournament: short stacks, need to accumulate chips but also preserve.\n\nI think a raise (bet) of 8 is reasonable. Or we could check to see turn, but we have equity. I'd raise to 8.\n\nCheck if opponent is aggressive? Past actions: they check flop often, sometimes call, rarely raise. So they are passive. So a bet may get called by weaker hands.\n\nThus decision: raise to 8.\n\n",

Preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, CO facing raise to 16 from seat 4 (MiniMax-M2). So action: call 16, raise minimum to 24, or fold.\n\nWe need to decide based on opponent tendencies. From recall: seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has many folds preflop, but some calls and occasional raises? Data: In hand 42, they called 16 preflop, bet 16 flop, then check turn and river, then folded river? Actually they bet flop 16, checked turn, checked river, then folded (maybe after bet). In hand 38, they called 2 preflop (maybe a small blind?), bet 4 flop. In hand 31, they bet river 35 (maybe after being in hand). So they can be aggressive postflop when they have a hand.\n\nPreflop pattern: many folds (lots of folds). Only a couple of calls (hand 42 call 16, hand 38 call 2). No raises recorded. So they likely are a tight player preflop, perhaps calling with decent hands.\n\nOur hand A3 offsuit is weak. In CO, we are late position; facing a raise from a tight player. With 18.5 BB stack, we could consider a 3-bet all-in? But hand is weak, not good for 3-bet.\n\nWe could call 16 to see flop, but with A3 it's low equity vs typical raising range of a tight player (maybe TT+, AK, AQ, maybe AJs, KQs). A3 will be dominated often.\n\nStack depth: 148 chips, after calling 16 we would have 132 left. Pot would be 28+16+16=60? Actually pot before action: 28 (includes blinds). After raise to 16, we call 16, pot becomes 28+16+16=60? Wait: the raise is 16 total? Actually seat 4 raise to 16 (so they raised 8 over BB). So amount to call is 16 (their total bet). So pot after call: 28 (existing) + 16 (their raise) + 16 (our call) = 60. That's 7.5 BB. With 148 stack, still decent.\n\nGiven hand weakness, folding is probably best. Also we are short-stacked relative to blinds? 18.5 BB is not super short, but still medium.\n\nConsider tournament stage: unknown, but we have decent stack. Preserve.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

With 17.5 BB, short stack, we could consider shove (all-in) if raise to 40 is not enough to apply pressure. Minimum raise is 40 total, which is 5 BB. Our stack 140, we could raise to 40 (5 BB) leaving 100 chips left. That's not all-in, but we could also go all-in (140). Considering hand strength, K4 suited is weak, not good for a call. Better to fold.\n\nBut consider possibility of shoving to steal blinds? In SB, we are out of position post-flop, but we could attempt a steal if opponents are tight.

In early tournament with 17 BB, we want to preserve chips. MiniMax-M2 raise size is 2x BB, which is standard open raise. Could consider 3-bet for value? But 2's are not good for 3-bet; they'd be dominated by higher pairs and overcards. Likely fold. However we could consider a 3-bet shove? At 17 BB, 3-bet all-in would be 136 chips, but we have only 136 chips total, after posting SB 4 we have 132 left. To shove, we need to put total 136? Actually all-in includes SB posted. So we would raise to 136 (total). That's a huge raise; likely not profitable. So folding is best.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 sometimes raises larger amounts (65) maybe when short stack? Not sure. But typical open raise.\n\nThus fold.\n\n",

But consider stack sizes: SB 4 chips (cannot act further), BB 8 chips (already posted). They may fold to raise? The raise is from CO; SB and BB already posted and are out of position. The SB is short and will be forced to either call 16 (can't, because only 4 chips) so they'd be all-in or fold. Actually they'd need to call 12 more to match 16, but they only have 4, so they'd go all-in for 4 (i.e., they'd be all-in for 4). But they could also fold. The BB has 8 chips, need call 8 more (total 16). So they'd be all-in for 8 if they call. So the raise could be a steal attempt.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, we should fold.

Table size unknown but seats 1-5, we are seat5 (BB). So seat2 is early position relative to us. Likely a standard raise range includes many broadways, pairs, suited connectors. Q5 offsuit is not a strong hand. Fold is likely correct.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: The recall shows they have raised amounts varying from 6 to 24. In later hands they raise 24 (3BB).

Wait seat1 posted SB 4, seat5 posted BB 8. Actually seat1 is SB, seat5 is BB. So preflop actions: seat5 post SB 4? Wait they wrote \"Seat 5 post_sb 4\" meaning seat5 posted small blind? But seat5 is BB seat? Actually they may have misordered: seat5 is our seat, they posted sb 4 (so we are SB?) But earlier they said Position: BB (Seat5). In many tables, seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB. But the actions show seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So maybe seats are rotated? Anyway we are the small blind? Let's parse: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So we are BB. The actions: seat5 post_sb 4 (contradiction). Could be a mistake; maybe they reversed. But we have to assume we are BB with 8 blind posted. The amount to call is 4, meaning the SB (seat5) posted 4, BB (seat1) posted 8. So we are SB? Actually amount to call is 4, meaning we need to call the BB's 8? Wait we have posted SB 4, then seat1 posted BB 8. So to call we need to put in 4 more to match BB (8). So amount to call = 4. Yes that matches: we posted 4, need to call 4 to match 8. So we are SB, not BB. But they said Position BB. Might be a mistake. Regardless, we are first to act preflop after the BB? Actually after blinds, action goes to UTG etc., but all others folded, so the SB acts first, then BB. Since only SB and BB are left, SB acts first. So we need to decide to call 4, raise to at least 16 (total). Hand 7h8c is suited? No it's off-suit: hearts and clubs, not suited. 7-8 offsuit is a marginal hand in SB vs BB. With 15.5 BB effective stack, we could consider raising to steal BB? But only opponent is BB (seat1). He has 194 chips, bigger stack. In SB vs BB, raising is standard. 7-8 offsuit is not a strong raise, but could be used as a steal if opponent folds. However opponent may defend wide. But given he's the BB, they might defend a wide range. But we have only 4 to call, small amount. Could also just call and see flop. But 7-8 offsuit is a speculative hand; calling cheap is okay to see flop, but we will be out of position post-flop (since BB acts first). However we have stack 124, not huge. Might be okay to call and see flop cheap. If flop hits, we could have straight draws.\n\nConsider pot odds: pot currently 12, call 4 => pot will be 16, we invest 4 for 16 pot => 25% equity needed. 7-8 offsuit vs unknown BB range (maybe 30% of hands) has maybe ~12% equity, not enough. So call is not profitable unless we expect to hit later.\n\nRaising: Minimum raise to 16 total (i.e., raise additional 8). So raise to 16 (total). That would be a raise of 8 extra beyond call (i.e., total 16). That would be 8 more than call? Actually call is 4, raise total 16 means additional 12. So we would be raising 8? Wait we have already posted 4, need to put total 16, so additional 12. That's a raise of 12. That's 3x the BB. This could pressure BB. But 7-8 offsuit is weak to raise; might be a bluff. Could be okay.\n\nGiven we have 15.5 BB, we could try to steal the BB's blind, but the BB may just call. If they call, we will be out of position with a weak hand.\n\nI think best is to fold? But folding a 7-8 offsuit in SB vs BB when only two players left seems wasteful because we already invested 4. But we can just call cheap and see flop; it's not a huge loss. Expectation? With 7-8 offsuit, we have about 12% equity vs random BB range (maybe 25% of hands). Not enough for a call. But we could also raise as a bluff: if BB"

With 17.5 BB, we could raise to maybe 30-40 to isolate. But we must ensure not overcommit. Opponent stack 144 chips, bigger. Raising to 30 would be 22 extra, total 30.

So we are short stack, but still 8 BB, not desperate. Hand is weak suited connectors. In SB vs BB, we can consider stealing the blind? But we are out of position post-flop. With 4h5h, potential to make straights/flush but low. Likely fold. But maybe we can call and see flop cheap? The pot is 24 (SB+BB+blinds). If we call 8, pot becomes 32, effective stack after call: we have 124 left. Opponent has 170 left (since they posted 16 from 186). So they have deeper stack. Calling is cheap but out of position. 4h5h is not a hand to call blind often, but with short stack we might want to try to see flop cheap and possibly steal later? However typical strategy: In SB with 8 BB, you may open raise to try to steal, but you have a weak hand. Raising to 32 (minimum raise) would be 32 total, i.e., raise 16 more? Actually raise to 32 total. That's a 16 raise over BB (which is 16). So raise to 32 would be 32 total (including 8 already posted). That is 16 extra. That is a small raise, maybe attempt steal? But opponent is BB with 186 chips, likely will defend often. Their raise history shows they sometimes raise preflop (maybe they are aggressive). But we don't have info on their BB defense. Could check recall for \"call\" actions? But we have raise patterns only. Might be aggressive.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, I'd fold.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise.

The opponent has been checking on every street, indicating a weak or marginal hand. As a short stack (7.2 BB) I need to accumulate chips, so I will shove all",
          "reasoning_content": "We have a turn with board 8d 5s 2s Jd. Our hand 4d7s, so we have no pair, no draw (gutshot? 6 would give straight 2-5-6-7-8 but we have 4 and 7, not). We have backdoor flush possibilities? Board has two diamonds (8d,Jd) and we have 4d, so we have a flush draw with one diamond, need two more diamonds on river, low chance. Also we have a gutshot? Straight possibilities: 3-4-5-6-7 would need 3 and 6, not. So basically very weak.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) has been checking on turn repeatedly (preflop called small blind, flop checked, turn checked). So they likely have a weak hand or a draw. They could be checking with a made hand like J8? Actually board: 8d 5s 2s Jd. They could have J8 (two pair) but they'd likely bet. Checking suggests maybe they have a middle pair (8,5,2) or a draw, or just a weak hand.\n\nWe have 116 chips, 7.2 BB, short stack. Pot is 32, we have 0 to call, can check or raise. Raising could be a bluff to steal, but we are short stack, and opponent may call or raise. Minimum raise is 16, which is about 0.5 BB? Actually blind is 8/16, so raise to 16 is just a raise of 0 (??). Wait minimum raise to 16 means we need to put total 16 chips into pot, which is equal to the big blind amount. Since we have already posted BB 16, and pot currently 32 includes our BB, opponent's small blind 8 and call 8 preflop. So raising to 16 means we add 0 extra? Actually we already have 16 in pot, but raising to 16 would be just matching? This is ambiguous. Usually raise to total amount includes your existing contribution, but we have contributed 16 already, so raise to 16 means no additional chips, which is not a raise. But they list minimum raise to 16, so maybe it's raise to 32? Let's assume raise to 16 means we need to put 16 total, which is same as current bet of 0, but raise must be at least double the previous bet? Since there is no bet, minimum raise is the big blind amount (16). So raising to 32 would be adding 16 chips. So raise_to should be 32? Actually legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we can check for free. If we raise, we need to put at least 16 chips (the big blind) as a raise, making total contribution 32 (16 more). So raise_to = 32.\n\nWe have 116 chips, can raise 32. Is a bluff worthwhile? Opponent likely has some hand; but we are short stack, need chips. If we check, we may see river for free but still weak. River card unknown. Could be a diamond giving us flush? We have 4d, board has 8d,Jd, need two more diamonds, impossible on river. So no flush. So checking likely leads to showdown losing.\n\nMaybe we should raise as a shove? But raise to 32 is not all-in; we still have 84 chips left. Could we go all-in? Not allowed unless raise is legal? We could raise more than min. Since we have 116, we could raise to 116 (all-in). Is that allowed? Yes, raise_to can be any amount up to stack. That would be a big bluff. But opponent may call if they have any decent hand (like J8, J5, J2, 8J, etc). But they have been checking, maybe they are weak. A shove could force fold many hands, giving us chips.\n\nGiven we are short stack and need to accumulate, a shove may be best. However, risk of being called by a decent hand could cost us all chips. But we have 7 BB, we need to double up. So a shove is reasonable.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 116 (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, weak hand, opponent checking, try to steal pot.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed. So final JSON.\n\n",

So we are after the BB (deepseek) posted 16, now it's our turn. No raises yet, just blinds posted. Amount to call 16 (the BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise by 16 more). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have 8h Jd, off-suit, not great. In BTN with 8.8 BB stack, we could consider a steal. However, we have relatively short stack; we could try to steal blind. Opponent in BB is DeepSeek-V3.2 with 418 chips (large stack). Likely they will defend with a wide range? Might be a decent defender. Also seat1 (SB) has 178 chips, but they already posted sb and are not acting now.\n\nWe could call 16 (total 32 in pot). If we call, we will be out of position post-flop with a marginal hand. Raise could be good to try to steal. Minimum raise to 32 means total 32 (i.e., raise by 16). That would be 32 total, i.e., we put 32 chips, making pot 56 (SB 8 + BB 16 + our raise 32). Actually raise to 32 total, so we add 16 more beyond call, so total bet 32 from us. That is 2 BB raise (size 2x BB). That's a standard steal size. With 8.8 BB, we can raise.\n\nGiven our hand is not premium, but still decent for a steal? J8 offsuit is not great for a raise from BTN with short stack. Might be okay as a steal but risk if called and we are out of position.\n\nConsider tournament stage: stack 140, 8.8 BB, short. Might want to try to double up by stealing blinds. But risk losing 16 chips if called and we get stuck. However, we can also just call and see flop.\n\nI think raising is appropriate to attempt steal. Opponent BB may defend with a wide range but also could have strong hands. If they call, we are in a tough spot.\n\nGiven we have only 8.8 BB, we could also go all-in (140) but that's too much. Minimum raise is 32, we can raise to 32.\n\nThus action: raise to 32.\n\nReasoning: short stack, position, attempt to steal blinds, hand not great but decent enough for a steal; raise size minimal.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Opponent DeepSeek has large stack, may 3-bet. Could also consider all-in to maximize fold equity. But 9 BB is not huge; an all-in would be 148, which is about 9 BB. Might be okay. However typical short stack strategy: push or raise? At 9 BB, many push. But we have AK, push is good. But we might also want to preserve chips if we think opponent may 3-bet and we could be forced to call all-in with AK? Actually if we push all-in, opponent can call or fold. If we raise to 48, opponent could 3-bet to maybe 120? That would put us in a tough spot. So better to go all-in.\n\nThus action: raise to 148 (all-in).

          "content": "We have hand #71 preflop. Position: BB (seat5). Our cards: 5c Kc (King-high suited). Stack 180 chips (11.2 BB). Blinds 8/16. Pot currently 24 (SB 8 + BB 16). Opponent seat1 is Kimi-K2, who posted BB 16 (so they are the big blind). Wait seat1 posted BB 16, seat5 posted SB 8? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Let's parse: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". The actions: preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 8. So seat5 posted small blind 8. Then seat1 post_bb 16. So seat1 is big blind. So we are in the small blind, not the big blind. The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\" but actions show seat5 posted sb. Maybe they consider seat5 as BB but posted sb because they are the BB? Actually typical: seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? But blind amounts: SB 8, BB 16. They say seat5 post_sb 8, seat1 post_bb 16. So seat5 is SB. So we are in SB with 5cKc. So we are out of position post-flop.\n\nOpponents: seat1 (Kimi-K2) is BB with 186 chips. The other seats folded.\n\nWe have to act: amount to call = 8 (the BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise to total of 32). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength, position, stack, opponent tendencies.\n\nKimi-K2's raise history: many raises preflop ranging from 6 to 24 to 113. Since the blind is 16, a raise of 24 would be to 40? Actually raise amounts given are \"amount\": e.g., raise 24. Not sure if that is total or additional. Probably the amount they raised to? In earlier data, they raise 6 (maybe to 6?). Hard to interpret. But we see they sometimes raise large (113). That suggests they are aggressive and maybe willing to shove.\n\nGiven our hand 5cKc, suited King, not premium but decent. In SB vs BB, we have 8 to call. Our stack 180, so 11 BB. If we call, we will see flop out of position. Could also raise to try to steal blind and isolate. Since we have a suited King, potential for flush and straight draws. Raising to 32 (total) is 2x BB, which is a standard raise size. Against a player who often raises, we could either call and see flop or raise to isolate.\n\nStack depth: 180 chips, about 11 BB, shallowish. In tournament, we might want to preserve stack but also pick spots.\n\nKimi-K2's pattern: they sometimes raise large, maybe 3-bet? But we are first to act after blinds; they are BB, they have not raised yet. So we can either call or raise.\n\nGiven we are SB with 5cKc, I'd consider raising to apply pressure. However, if they are likely to 3-bet all-in (like they have 113 raise previously), we could be in trouble. But 113 is huge relative to blind; maybe that was a shove later.\n\nWe have 11 BB, so a raise to 32 would be about 2 BB, which is a standard open raise from SB. Since only BB left, we could open-raise.\n\nBut we need to consider that the BB (Kimi-K2) may respond with a re-raise (3-bet). Our hand is not strong for a 3-bet. So maybe better to just call and see flop.\n\nPot odds: call 8 to win 24+? Actually pot after call would be 24 + 8 = 32? Wait pot currently 24 (SB+BB). If we call 8, pot becomes 32. So pot odds 8/32 = 25% required to break even. Our hand equity vs random range? 5cKc vs random is about 30% preflop. So calling is +EV.\n\nRaising to 32 would add 16 more to pot (so pot would be 24+8+16=48). Our raise invests 16 extra, pot odds for opponent to call 16 to win 48 = 33% needed. Opponent may fold many hands.\n\nThus raising could be good to steal BB, but we have only 8 to call. Since we have a decent hand, calling is fine.\n\nGiven we are short stacked, but not extremely short, we can call.\n\nThus choose \"call\". Reason: decent hand, good pot odds, preserve stack"

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #71 preflop. Position: BB (seat5). Our cards: 5c Kc (King-high suited). Stack 180 chips (11.2 BB). Blinds 8/16. Pot currently 24 (SB 8 + BB 16). Opponent seat1 is Kimi-K2, who posted BB 16 (so they are the big blind). Wait seat1 posted BB 16, seat5 posted SB 8? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Let's parse: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". The actions: preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 8. So seat5 posted small blind 8. Then seat1 post_bb 16. So seat1 is big blind. So we are in the small blind, not the big blind. The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\" but actions show seat5 posted sb. Maybe they consider seat5 as BB but posted sb because they are the BB? Actually typical: seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? But blind amounts: SB 8, BB 16. They say seat5 post_sb 8, seat1 post_bb 16. So seat5 is SB. So we are in SB with 5cKc. So we are out of position post-flop.\n\nOpponents: seat1 (Kimi-K2) is BB with 186 chips. The other seats folded.\n\nWe have to act: amount to call = 8 (the BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise to total of 32). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength, position, stack, opponent tendencies.\n\nKimi-K2's raise history: many raises preflop ranging from 6 to 24 to 113. Since the blind is 16, a raise of 24 would be to 40? Actually raise amounts given are \"amount\": e.g., raise 24. Not sure if that is total or additional. Probably the amount they raised to? In earlier data, they raise 6 (maybe to 6?). Hard to interpret. But we see they sometimes raise large (113). That suggests they are aggressive and maybe willing to shove.\n\nGiven our hand 5cKc, suited King, not premium but decent. In SB vs BB, we have 8 to call. Our stack 180, so 11 BB. If we call, we will see flop out of position. Could also raise to try to steal blind and isolate. Since we have a suited King, potential for flush and straight draws. Raising to 32 (total) is 2x BB, which is a standard raise size. Against a player who often raises, we could either call and see flop or raise to isolate.\n\nStack depth: 180 chips, about 11 BB, shallowish. In tournament, we might want to preserve stack but also pick spots.\n\nKimi-K2's pattern: they sometimes raise large, maybe 3-bet? But we are first to act after blinds; they are BB, they have not raised yet. So we can either call or raise.\n\nGiven we are SB with 5cKc, I'd consider raising to apply pressure. However, if they are likely to 3-bet all-in (like they have 113 raise previously), we could be in trouble. But 113 is huge relative to blind; maybe that was a shove later.\n\nWe have 11 BB, so a raise to 32 would be about 2 BB, which is a standard open raise from SB. Since only BB left, we could open-raise.\n\nBut we need to consider that the BB (Kimi-K2) may respond with a re-raise (3-bet). Our hand is not strong for a 3-bet. So maybe better to just call and see flop.\n\nPot odds: call 8 to win 24+? Actually pot after call would be 24 + 8 = 32? Wait pot currently 24 (SB+BB). If we call 8, pot becomes 32. So pot odds 8/32 = 25% required to break even. Our hand equity vs random range? 5cKc vs random is about 30% preflop. So calling is +EV.\n\nRaising to 32 would add 16 more to pot (so pot would be 24+8+16=48). Our raise invests 16 extra, pot odds for opponent to call 16 to win 48 = 33% needed. Opponent may fold many hands.\n\nThus raising could be good to steal BB, but we have only 8 to call. Since we have a decent hand, calling is fine.\n\nGiven we are short stacked, but not extremely short, we can call.\n\nThus choose \"call\". Reason: decent hand, good pot odds, preserve stack",

But we might want to protect against overcards? Board has 6-3-5, overcards are K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, A. Opponent could have a 6 or 3, but we are ahead. So raising is fine.\n\nI'll raise to 48 (i.e., bet 48). That's total amount we put in? Actually raise_to is total amount we are putting in. Since we have not put anything yet, raise_to = 48 means bet 48. That's okay.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Need to consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 is SB, they have raised preflop historically varying amounts 12-24-113. The sample shows they sometimes raise big (113). They have 178 chips left (short stack). Could be aggressive. DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB hasn't acted yet. No info.\n\nGiven we are BTN with a weak hand, likely fold. But also could consider a steal if SB and BB are tight. However SB is Kimi-K2 who appears aggressive (raises). But they are SB; they already posted 8, not yet acted. Actually it's our turn; we can raise to try to steal both blinds. Our stack is 204, we could raise to 32 (2 BB). That's a small raise. Might get called by BB or SB.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop as BB with 7d Th, stack 188 chips, blinds 8/16, pot 32 (blinds + small blind call). Opponent in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called the small blind (8) and is the only other active player. So we are heads-up in the blinds. Our hand 7T offsuit. In BB we have option to check (i.e., just call 0) or raise min to 32 (i.e., raise to 32 total). We need to consider opponent's tendencies: from recall, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised preflop only once in hand 67 (raise to 64). Mostly folds preflop. So they are likely tight, not aggressive. They called small blind here (8). So they likely have a hand that can call a small blind, maybe a speculative hand or a broadway. Our hand 7T is not premium but decent for heads-up. With 11.8 BB stack, we could raise to steal, but opponent already called the SB, so they are in the pot. Raising could isolate. In heads-up, 7T is a decent raising hand, especially against a tight player who may fold to raise. However we are out of position (BB) but still have position after flop? Actually we are in BB vs SB, after flop we will be out of position (SB acts first). So raising can be good to take initiative.\n\nStack depth: 188 chips, min raise to 32 (i.e., raise 16 more? Actually amount to call is 0, but minimum raise is 32 total, meaning raise to 32 chips (including the 16 BB). So raise of 16 extra chips. That's a small raise, about 2 BB. Could also raise bigger, but legal actions only mention raise (no amount). Usually raise_to is the total. We can raise to any amount above min raise, but we need to decide. Probably raise to 48 or 64 to apply pressure. But we need to consider opponent's stack: they have 148 chips. A raise to 48 would be 3 BB extra. Might be okay.\n\nGiven they just called SB, they may have a hand like suited connectors, low pairs, etc. 7T is ahead of many. Raising could be good. However we also have a short stack (11.8 BB). If we raise and get called, we will be in a post-flop situation out of position with a medium hand. Might be okay.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, preserving stack is important. But we also can try to steal. I'd lean to raise to about 48 (3x BB) to put pressure.\n\nBut we need to check legal actions: raise is allowed. So choose raise_to 48.\n\nReasoning: Hand decent, opponent tight, raise to isolate and potentially win pot preflop or get heads-up.\n\nThus output JSON.",

So we have gutshot straight draw? Let's see: we have 7 and T, board A Q 5. Potential straight combos: 8-9-10-J? Not. With T we have open-ended? Not. With 7 we could get 6-8? Not. Actually we have gutshot to straight: need 8-9 for 7-8-9-10-J? No J not present. Actually we need 8-9 to make 7-8-9-10-J? J not on board, but could be in hand? We have T, so need 8-9-J? That's not a straight. Let's consider possible draws: We have a pair? No. We have no pair. Overcards: Ace and Queen on board. Our Ten is a decent overcard to board? Not directly. Our hand is weak. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 48 into pot 144 (so pot now 192 after bet). They bet half pot. We have 156 stack, after call we would have 108 left? Actually we have 156 total, we have already invested preflop: we posted 16 BB, then raised to 48 (total 48?), wait preflop: BB posted 16, then raise to 48 (so additional 32). So we have invested 48 total preflop. Opponent called 32 to match raise, so they have 48 in pot now? Actually pot after preflop: blinds 8+16=24, plus calls and raise. Let's compute: Seat4 posted sb 8, seat5 posted bb 16, seat4 called 8 (so matches big blind?), seat5 raise to 48 (so adds 32 more), seat4 call 32 (so adds 32). So total contributions: seat4: 8+8+32 = 48. seat5: 16+32 = 48. So pot = 96 before flop. Then flop bet 48 by seat4, so pot now 144 (as given). So we need to call 48 more to stay in, our stack after preflop 156-48=108 left. So call 48 leaves us 60 chips left. So we would be short-stacked relative to opponent (they have 68 chips total). If we call, we will have 60 left vs opponent 20 left? Actually opponent has 68 total, they already invested 48, so they have 20 left. So after call, pot would be 144+48=192, we would have 60 chips left, opponent would be all-in with 20 left? Actually they'd have 20 chips left, but they could still act later? It's the flop, we act now. If we call, we will have 60, they have 20 left, they'd be short-stacked but not all-in. So we would be in position with 60 chips vs them 20.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely fold. But we might consider raising as a bluff? Minimum raise to 96 total, i.e., raise additional 48 (to 96). That would be a total contribution of 96 on flop, meaning we raise 48 more on top of call 48. That would be a 2x pot raise (pot 144). That could be a bluff, but we have only 108 chips left total; raising to 96 would leave us 12 chips left. That's a big move. Opponent has 68 chips total, 48 in pot, 20 left. If we raise to 96, they'd have to call 48 more (they have 20 left) can't call, they'd be forced to fold or go all-in for 20 (but raise to 96 is more than they can call, they'd be all-in for remaining 20). So they'd be forced to either fold or call all-in for 20 (which they'd be short). Usually they'd just fold. So raising all-in could be a bluff to win pot.

So we have gutshot straight draw? Let's see: we have 7 and T, board A Q 5. Potential straight combos: 8-9-10-J? Not. With T we have open-ended? Not. With 7 we could get 6-8? Not. Actually we have gutshot to straight: need 8-9 for 7-8-9-10-J? No J not present. Actually we need 8-9 to make 7-8-9-10-J? J not on board, but could be in hand? We have T, so need 8-9-J? That's not a straight. Let's consider possible draws: We have a pair? No. We have no pair. Overcards: Ace and Queen on board. Our Ten is a decent overcard to board? Not directly. Our hand is weak. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 48 into pot 144 (so pot now 192 after bet). They bet half pot. We have 156 stack, after call we would have 108 left? Actually we have 156 total, we have already invested preflop: we posted 16 BB, then raised to 48 (total 48?), wait preflop: BB posted 16, then raise to 48 (so additional 32). So we have invested 48 total preflop. Opponent called 32 to match raise, so they have 48 in pot now? Actually pot after preflop: blinds 8+16=24, plus calls and raise. Let's compute: Seat4 posted sb 8, seat5 posted bb 16, seat4 called 8 (so matches big blind?), seat5 raise to 48 (so adds 32 more), seat4 call 32 (so adds 32). So total contributions: seat4: 8+8+32 = 48. seat5: 16+32 = 48. So pot = 96 before flop. Then flop bet 48 by seat4, so pot now 144 (as given). So we need to call 48 more to stay in, our stack after preflop 156-48=108 left. So call 48 leaves us 60 chips left. So we would be short-stacked relative to opponent (they have 68 chips total). If we call, we will have 60 left vs opponent 20 left? Actually opponent has 68 total, they already invested 48, so they have 20 left. So after call, pot would be 144+48=192, we would have 60 chips left, opponent would be all-in with 20 left? Actually they'd have 20 chips left, but they could still act later? It's the flop, we act now. If we call, we will have 60, they have 20 left, they'd be short-stacked but not all-in. So we would be in position with 60 chips vs them 20.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely fold. But we might consider raising as a bluff? Minimum raise to 96 total, i.e., raise additional 48 (to 96). That would be a total contribution of 96 on flop, meaning we raise 48 more on top of call 48. That would be a 2x pot raise (pot 144). That could be a bluff, but we have only 108 chips left total; raising to 96 would leave us 12 chips left. That's a big move. Opponent has 68 chips total, 48 in pot, 20 left. If we raise to 96, they'd have to call 48 more (they have 20 left) can't call, they'd be forced to fold or go all-in for 20 (but raise to 96 is more than they can call, they'd be all-in for remaining 20). So they'd be forced to either fold or call all-in for 20 (which they'd be short). Usually they'd just fold. So raising all-in could be a bluff to win pot. But we have only 60 chips left after calling; raising all-in (i.e., 108 total) would be more than min raise? Actually we can go all-in, but we only have 108 left total. Minimum raise to 96 is allowed (since we have enough). We could go all-in for 108, which is > min raise, but raise_to must be total amount we put in? Actually raise_to is total amount we are putting in (including previous call). So if we raise to 108 (all-in), that is allowed as raise. But the legal raise minimum is 96,",

Opponent seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (186 chips). They posted BB 16 (they are BB? Wait seat1 is BB? Actually seat1 posted bb 16. That is weird: seat5 is BB, but seat1 posted bb 16? Possibly seat1 is SB? Let's parse: Actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 8 (so seat5 is SB, not BB). Seat1 post_bb 16 (so seat1 is BB). So we are actually SB, not BB. The description says Position: BB (Seat5) but actions indicate SB. Might be a mistake. Let's trust the description: Position BB seat5, but they posted SB 8. Actually seat5 posted SB 8, meaning they are small blind. So we are in SB with Kh4h. Opponent seat1 is BB with 186 chips, they posted BB 16. So we are out of position post-flop. Stack 148, we have 9.2 BB effective.\n\nWe need to decide legal actions: fold, call, raise. Amount to call 8 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise to 32 total). So raising to 32 would be 16 more (since we have already posted 8). Our hand is weak. With 9 BB, we want to preserve stack. King-high unsuited (or suited hearts) but low kicker 4. Not a good hand to raise. Could consider a limp (call 8) to see flop cheap, but being out of position with weak hand is risky. However we are in SB with short stack; limping may get us in multi-way? Only two players left (SB and BB). If we call, we will be in the big blind's position post-flop (they act first). They have 186 chips, larger stack. They could raise on flop. With weak hand, we risk losing more. Folding might be okay.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: recall shows Kimi-K2 has raised preflop with amounts 12-24-113, seems they often raise, maybe aggressive. In this hand they just posted BB, not yet acted. They may raise on flop if they have decent hand. So calling with Kh4h is not great.\n\nGiven short stack, we could consider a raise (shove) but we only have 148 chips, min raise to 32 is small relative to stack, not all-in. Raising to 32 would be a small raise, maybe to steal blinds? But with weak hand, not advisable.\n\nThus best action: fold.

But there are two players left: SB with 202 chips, BB with 378 chips. Both have larger stacks. We are on button, can raise to try to steal. Our stack is short, but we can go all-in (148) which is about 9.25 BB total (including blinds). Minimum raise is to 32 (i.e., raise to 32 total). We could raise to maybe 48 or go all-in.\n\nConsider hand strength: 6-7 suited is a speculative hand, but can be good in short-stack push/fold scenario. In tournament, with 9 BB, many push/fold strategy: we could push all-in to apply pressure, especially from button. Opponents may call with wide ranges? SB has 202 chips (~12.6 BB) and BB 378 (~23.6 BB). Both may call all-in with decent ranges. 6-7 suited is marginal but still okay for push.\n\nGiven we have 9 BB, typical push range from button includes many suited connectors, maybe 6-7 suited is within push range. So go all-in (raise to 148). Legal actions allow raise; raise_to should be total amount we put in (including our call). All-in amount is 148 (our stack). So raise_to = 148.\n\nReasoning: short stack, button, decent suited connector, want to steal or get chips. All-in maximizes fold equity and potential to double.\n\nThus action: raise to 148.\n\n",

Actually pot currently 72 includes blinds 8+16+ maybe antes? Wait pot 72 includes blinds 8+16+ maybe previous? Preflop: seat4 posted SB 8, seat5 posted BB 16, seat3 raise to 48 (so adds 48). So pot currently 8+16+48 = 72. To call 32 adds to pot 104. So pot odds: need to call 32 to win 104 (including opponent's raise). That's 30.8% needed.

Minimum raise to 80 total (so raise to 80, which is 64 more). That would be 80 total, still leaves us with 156-80=76 chips left. Not all-in. Could we go all-in? All-in would be 156, but raise must be at least 80, we could raise to 156 (all-in). That would be a 3-bet all-in. Is that advisable? KTh offsuit is not a strong all-in hand vs early position raise. Likely fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: raise amounts varied: 6,12,30,40,40. So they sometimes raise small, sometimes larger. This raise is 48, which is larger than previous 40. Might indicate strong hand. So better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have data: Kimi-K2 Thinking raises varied amounts, from small 6 to huge 178 (all-in). So they can be aggressive, sometimes all-in. We have 9 BB, not huge. Raising to 32 may invite a re-raise or call. Since we are short stack, maybe we should just call and see flop? But with AQ, we have good equity. However being in blind, if we raise to 32, we risk being 3-bet all-in? Opponent may shove all-in with 178? Actually opponent's stack is 210 chips, so all-in would be 210. Our raise to 32 is small compared to that. If opponent re-raises all-in, we would be forced to call all-in with AQ, which is okay? 148 vs 210, we would be short. Might be okay.\n\nBut given we have 9 BB, we could also go all-in (148). But that is a large raise, maybe not needed. Considering tournament, preserving stack is important. AQ is strong, but not premium like AA, KK. Short stack strategy: push or fold. With 9 BB, typical push/fold threshold is around 10 BB; many push with AQ. So maybe go all-in.\n\nBut we have only 148 chips, which is 9.2 BB, we could push all-in to maximize fold equity. The opponent may call with weaker hands. So go all-in.\n\nLegal actions include raise; raise_to can be total amount. All-in would be 148 (or maybe 148 total? we already posted 16, so need to add 132 more to reach 148). But raise_to should be total amount we are putting in, i.e., 148? Usually raise_to is total bet amount. Since we have posted 16, raising to 148 means adding 132. That's fine.\n\nThus action: raise to 148 (all-in). Reason: short stack, strong hand, maximize fold equity, opponent aggressive.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Actually preflop: SB posted 16, BB posted 32, SB called 16 (meaning they just called the BB? Wait typical: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. Then SB could raise or call. Here SB post_sb 16 (small blind). BB post_bb 32 (big blind). Then Seat 1 fold, Seat 3 fold, Seat 4 call 16 (so SB called the BB? Actually they call the big blind, so they put 16 more to match 32, making total 32 each). So now pot is 64 (2*32). No further action, it's our turn (BB). Amount to call is 0 (since SB matched). We can check or raise. With 6s3s, not a good hand, but we are short-stacked, we could consider a shove (all-in) to try to steal blind? But we are already in BB, can't steal. Raising could be a bluff attempt to win pot, but with 4.4 BB, raising to 64 (minimum) would be 32 more (since we already have 32 in pot). That would be a raise to 64 total, i.e., additional 32. That would be a 2 BB raise, still small. Might be okay as a steal attempt if opponent is tight. But we have a weak hand; raising could be okay as a bluff, but risk if opponent calls. Opponent is MiniMax-M2 with 28 chips (short stack). They already called the blind; they have 28 chips left, less than a full raise. Actually they have 28 chips total, but they've already put 32 (16 blind + 16 call). Wait they started with 28 chips total? Actually seat 4 has 28 chips at start. They posted SB 16, then called 16 more, so they have 28-32? That's impossible: they can't call more than they have. So maybe they were short-stacked and posted all-in? Actually they posted SB 16, then call 16 means they put total 32, which exceeds 28. Something off. Possibly they are all-in for 28 chips: they posted 16 blind, then called remaining 12 (so call 12). But description says call 16. Might be a mistake. Anyway, they likely are all-in or short stack. We are BB with 140 chips, could raise to 64 (i.e., 32 more). Opponent cannot call more than they have; they'd be all-in for less. Might be okay to raise and get chips. But with such weak hand, maybe just check and hope to see flop cheap? But we are already invested 32, pot 64. If we check, we see flop for free. With 6s3s, suited low connectors, could hit flush or straight draws. Short stack but still have chips. Maybe best to check and see flop.\n\nThus action: check. Reasoning: weak hand, not worth raising; check to see flop.\n\nLegal actions include check. So output.",

Actually board has 6-7-8, we have a 6, so we have middle pair? Actually board: 6,7,8. Our 6 gives us a pair of sixes, which is the lowest pair on board (6 is lowest). There are possible straight draws: board is 6-7-8, any 5 or 9 gives straight. Our hand 6s 3s gives us a pair plus a flush draw? Suits: we have two spades, board has hearts hearts diamond. No flush draw. So we have a weak hand. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) is short stacked (28 chips). Their stack is 28 chips, they are in the small blind (post_sb 16) and called preflop, so they have 12 chips left after posting? Actually they posted 16, then called 16 to match BB, so they have 28-16=12 left? Wait stack is 28 chips total. They posted 16 sb, then called 16 (so they added 16 more), total contributed 32? Actually BB is 32, they called 16 to match BB? Preflop: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. Then SB calls 16 (to match BB). So SB's total contribution is 16+16 = 32. So they have 28-32 = -4? Something off: The stack listed for seat 4 is 28 chips. That is their current stack before posting? Typically stack includes blinds? Usually the stack shown is after posting? Not sure. But they have 28 chips left after posting? Possibly they posted 16 sb and now have 12 remaining. But then they called 16 (so they would need 16 more, but they only have 12). So maybe they are all-in? But the action says they call 16, meaning they had enough chips. So perhaps the stack shown is after posting? Let's assume they have 28 chips total after posting sb? Actually typical notation: \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 28 chips\" is the stack before posting. Then they post sb 16, leaving 12, then call 16? That can't. So maybe they posted sb 16, then call 16, meaning they added another 16, total 32 contributed, leaving -4, impossible. So maybe they posted sb 16, then call 16 meaning they just called the BB's 32 by putting 16 (since they already posted 16). So they contributed total 32, leaving 28-32 = -4. Something inconsistent. Perhaps the stack shown is after posting? If after posting sb, they have 28 chips left, they then call 16, leaving 12. That would make sense: initial stack 44, posted 16, left 28, then call 16, left 12. But we don't know. Anyway they are short stacked, maybe around 12 chips left.\n\nPot is 64 chips. We have 140 chips. Opponent is short, may be willing to go all-in.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely we should check and possibly fold to a bet. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. Legal actions include raise. Raising would be aggressive, but we have weak hand. Opponent may have a straight or better. So check.\n\nThus output: action check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Suits: we have spades 6s 3s, board has hearts hearts diamonds spade Jack. No spade on board except J\u2660, so we have a flush draw with J\u2660? Actually we have spades, board has J\u2660, so we have two spades in hand, one spade on board, need two more spades to flush, not currently. Straight possibilities: board 6-7-8, we have 6, we could make 5-6-7-8-9 straight if a 5 or 9 appears. Not immediate.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) seat 4, stack 28 chips (short stack). They have checked turn after flop check. So they have 28 chips left, likely all-in? Minimum raise is 32, but they have only 28, cannot raise. So they are short stack, maybe they will go all-in later. The pot is 64. We have 140 chips, 4.4 BB. We are in big blind with short stack opponent in the small blind? Actually seat 4 posted sb 16, seat5 posted bb 32. So opponent is SB with 28 chips left (so they are very short). They checked turn, meaning they have 0 chips left? Wait they posted 16 sb, then called 16 preflop (so they added 16 more, total 32). Then after flop and turn they checked, but they have 28 chips left. How could they have 28 chips left after posting 32? Actually they started with 28 chips total? The description says seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 28 chips (maybe that's their current stack). They posted sb 16 (so they had 28, posted 16, left 12). Then preflop they called 16 (so they added 16, but they only had 12 left? Something off). Possibly the stack numbers are after posting? Let's interpret: Seat4 stack is 28 chips before posting? They posted sb 16, then called 16, total 32 contributed, which exceeds 28. So maybe the stack numbers are after posting? Actually after posting sb 16, they have 12 left. They called 16, which would be all-in for 12, but they can't call 16. Something inconsistent. Might be that seat4's stack is 28 after posting sb? So they posted 16, leaving 12, then they call 16 meaning they go all-in for remaining 12, but the call amount is 16, but they can only call 12, they'd be all-in and the pot would be adjusted. But the logs show they called 16, maybe they had more chips originally. Anyway they are short.\n\nGiven we have 140 chips, we could consider raising to put pressure. Our hand is weak: just a pair of sixes, board is 6-7-8-J, opponent could have 9,5 for straight, could have 7-8 for trips, could have J? Actually they could have 9-5 for straight (9-8-7-6-5), also could have 5-9, also could have 7-7 for trips, 8-8 for trips, 6-6 for set (but we have a six, so they can't have another six? Actually there are four sixes, we have 6s, board has 6h, so remaining sixes are 6c and 6d. Opponent could have 6c6d for quads? Unlikely.\n\nWe have short stack opponent checking; they might be trying to get to showdown cheap. Our stack is also shortish 140, but we have 4.4 BB, we could try to steal. But raising might be risky because opponent could have a stronger hand and call all-in (they have 28 left). Minimum raise is 32, but opponent only has 28, so they cannot call a raise; they could go all-in for 28 and we would be facing a raise of 28? Actually raise to 32 is total, we would put 32 in, opponent can call all-in for 28? In practice, you can raise to 32, opponent can call all-in for 28, they'd be all-in for 28, you'd have 4 extra in pot. But if you raise to 32, you are putting 32 chips, leaving you 108. That might be okay.\n\nBut what is our best action? Since opponent is short, we could consider raising"

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand: 6s 3s. Board: 6h 7h 8d Js. So we have pair of sixes, plus a gutshot straight draw? Board is 6-7-8-J, we have 6, so we have a pair, also we have a backdoor flush? Suits: we have spades 6s 3s, board has hearts hearts diamonds spade Jack. No spade on board except J\u2660, so we have a flush draw with J\u2660? Actually we have spades, board has J\u2660, so we have two spades in hand, one spade on board, need two more spades to flush, not currently. Straight possibilities: board 6-7-8, we have 6, we could make 5-6-7-8-9 straight if a 5 or 9 appears. Not immediate.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) seat 4, stack 28 chips (short stack). They have checked turn after flop check. So they have 28 chips left, likely all-in? Minimum raise is 32, but they have only 28, cannot raise. So they are short stack, maybe they will go all-in later. The pot is 64. We have 140 chips, 4.4 BB. We are in big blind with short stack opponent in the small blind? Actually seat 4 posted sb 16, seat5 posted bb 32. So opponent is SB with 28 chips left (so they are very short). They checked turn, meaning they have 0 chips left? Wait they posted 16 sb, then called 16 preflop (so they added 16 more, total 32). Then after flop and turn they checked, but they have 28 chips left. How could they have 28 chips left after posting 32? Actually they started with 28 chips total? The description says seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 28 chips (maybe that's their current stack). They posted sb 16 (so they had 28, posted 16, left 12). Then preflop they called 16 (so they added 16, but they only had 12 left? Something off). Possibly the stack numbers are after posting? Let's interpret: Seat4 stack is 28 chips before posting? They posted sb 16, then called 16, total 32 contributed, which exceeds 28. So maybe the stack numbers are after posting? Actually after posting sb 16, they have 12 left. They called 16, which would be all-in for 12, but they can't call 16. Something inconsistent. Might be that seat4's stack is 28 after posting sb? So they posted 16, leaving 12, then they call 16 meaning they go all-in for remaining 12, but the call amount is 16, but they can only call 12, they'd be all-in and the pot would be adjusted. But the logs show they called 16, maybe they had more chips originally. Anyway they are short.\n\nGiven we have 140 chips, we could consider raising to put pressure. Our hand is weak: just a pair of sixes, board is 6-7-8-J, opponent could have 9,5 for straight, could have 7-8 for trips, could have J? Actually they could have 9-5 for straight (9-8-7-6-5), also could have 5-9, also could have 7-7 for trips, 8-8 for trips, 6-6 for set (but we have a six, so they can't have another six? Actually there are four sixes, we have 6s, board has 6h, so remaining sixes are 6c and 6d. Opponent could have 6c6d for quads? Unlikely.\n\nWe have short stack opponent checking; they might be trying to get to showdown cheap. Our stack is also shortish 140, but we have 4.4 BB, we could try to steal. But raising might be risky because opponent could have a stronger hand and call all-in (they have 28 left). Minimum raise is 32, but opponent only has 28, so they cannot call a raise; they could go all-in for 28 and we would be facing a raise of 28? Actually raise to 32 is total, we would put 32 in, opponent can call all-in for 28? In practice, you can raise to 32, opponent can call all-in for 28, they'd be all-in for 28, you'd have 4 extra in pot. But if you raise to 32, you are putting 32 chips, leaving you 108. That might be okay.\n\nBut what is our best action? Since opponent is short, we could consider raising",

Opponent likely has something better? Board is quite coordinated: possible straight draws: 9T would give straight 6-7-8-9-T? Actually board 5-6-7-8-J, straight possibilities: 4-5-6-7-8 (needs 4), 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 9), 6-7-8-9-T (needs 9,T), 7-8-9-T-J (needs 9,T). So many combos. Opponent could have a straight, two pair, set (6 or 8), or flush draw missed. Our pair is likely losing. Check is safe? If we check, we may win if opponent also checks with missed draws. But opponent checking suggests maybe weak hand. However board is scary; many hands beat us. Should we consider betting? We have short stack 4.4 BB, but still 140 chips, pot 64, raising to 32 (minimum) is a half-pot bet. Could be a bluff. Opponent only 28 chips left (short stack).

Actually seat1 posted BB 32, seat5 posted SB 16. So seat5 is SB? The description says Position: BB (Seat5). But they posted SB 16. Possibly small blind is seat5, big blind seat1. So we are SB? But they say Position: BB (Seat5). Might be reversed due to numbering. Regardless, we are the small blind (post 16) and big blind posted 32. So amount to call is 16 (to match big blind). Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., raise to 64 total). Hand Qc4d is very weak. Should we fold? In a tournament with 5.9 BB stack, we are short stacked. We could consider shove (all-in) to try to double up, but with Q4 offsuit it's weak. However with 5.9 BB, you may need to be aggressive. But Q4 is not a good candidate for shove; typical push range from SB with 6 BB includes maybe any ace, broadway, suited connectors, etc. Q4 offsuit is likely not in optimal push range.

But actions show seat4 call 28, maybe they called a raise? The sequence: seat1 post_sb 16, seat3 post_bb 32, seat4 call 28. So seat4 must be a player in seat4 (but earlier said out). Probably seat4 is a player with 0 chips? Anyway they called 28 maybe a raise from seat1? Actually seat1 posted SB 16, then seat3 posted BB 32, then seat4 call 28. That suggests seat4 is a player in the big blind? Not sure. But amount to call is 32, min raise to 64.\n\nWe are BTN with 4T off-suit. Very weak hand, especially short stack. Should we fold? Consider that we have 5.9 BB, we could consider stealing blind with raise, but 4T is not a good raising hand. Short stack: you could push all-in (188) to try to double up. But raise to 64 is min raise; we could raise to maybe 64 or go all-in. Need to consider opponent tendencies: Seat1 Kimi-K2 (SB) has been raising preflop with amounts 12-24 and one huge 113. That suggests they may be aggressive and possibly push with a range. Seat3 DeepSeek-V3.2 is BB with 498 chips. No data yet. Our hand is weak, but we could consider folding to preserve stack. At 5.9 BB, folding is safe but you lose opportunity. However, 4T offsuit is not a steal-worthy hand; typical steal range from BTN is broader (A2+, K9+, Q9+, J9+, T9, 98, 87, etc). 4T is far below.

Calling 64 would require >24% equity, which JTs likely doesn't have against an UTG opener. An all\u2011in raise maximizes fold equity and, if called, our hand has decent equity (~30%+) against a typical raise range.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with Jd Ts, stack 156 (4.9 BB). Big blind 32, small blind 16. Action: SB (seat4) posted 16, BB posted 32. Seat1 folded, seat3 (DeepSeek) raised to 96 (so raise of 64 over BB). Seat4 (MiniMax) called 56? Wait seat4 is SB, they called 56 (i.e., they put 56 total, meaning they called 40 more? Actually SB posted 16, to call raise to 96 they need 80 more, but they called 56? That seems odd. Probably seat4 is out of chips? But they have 0 chips out. Hmm seat4 out. Maybe seat4 is out and they can't call. But the log says seat4 call 56. Anyway amount to call is 64 (to match 96). So we need to decide: fold, call 64, or raise min to 160 (total). Our stack 156, cannot raise to 160 (needs 160 total, we have 156). So we could go all-in for 156 (which is less than min raise). That's allowed as all-in.\n\nWe have Jd Ts, suited connectors, decent for short stack. In BB with 4.9 BB, raise from UTG (DeepSeek) to 96 (3 BB). Actually 96 is 3 BB? Wait BB is 32, so 96 is 3 BB. So they raised 3BB. That's a standard open raise size. As BB we are short stacked, we could consider 3-bet all-in to try to steal or get equity. JTs is a decent hand for 3-bet vs unknown opponent. Our stack is 156, so all-in would be 156 total, which is 4.875 BB. That's a decent raise. Opponent's raise size is 96, we could call 64 to see flop, but with 4.9 BB we risk being forced all-in later. Better to go all-in now? Let's consider opponent tendencies: recall shows DeepSeek often raises small amounts (6,12,30,40,48). Those are relative to blinds? Not sure. In earlier hands, they raise 6 (maybe 0.5BB), 12 (1BB), 30 (0.94?), but not consistent. In recent hand 78 they raised 48 (1.5BB). But this hand they raised 96 (3BB). So they may be opening bigger when short stacked. We have JTs, which is a decent hand but not premium. Against a raise from UTG (seat3) we are out of position. With 4.9 BB we could call and hope to hit a straight/flush. But call 64 puts us at 120 total (still short). Could be fine.\n\nWhat is the pot odds? Pot currently 200 + 96 raise? Actually pot before our action: SB 16, BB 32, raise 96 (adds 96 to pot). So pot now 200 (as given). To call 64, we invest 64 to win 200+64? Actually after we call, pot will be 200+64 = 264. So odds: 64/264 = 24% to win 264. So need equity >24% to call. JTs vs unknown range (maybe 10-15%?). Likely less than 24% preflop. So call not justified. Raise all-in could be a semi-bluff. If opponent folds, we win 200. If they call, we are all-in with JTs vs their range. Our equity vs typical raise range (maybe 15% of hands) could be around 30-35% maybe. So expected value maybe positive.\n\nThus best action: raise all-in (156 total). Legal actions include raise but min raise to 160, we can't meet min, but we can go all-in. So action: raise with raise_to 156.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

The pot after preflop: Let's compute.\n\nBlinds: SB 16, BB 32. Preflop actions: Seat4 posts SB 16 (but seat4 is out? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, but they posted SB, but they are out? Not sure). Seat5 (us) posts BB 32.\n\nSeat1 folds. Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raises 96 (to 96 total? Actually raise to 96? Usually raise amount includes blind, but they said raise 96, maybe they put 96 total (i.e., 96-32 = 64 more). Then seat4 call 56 (calls the raise? They call 56 more? Not sure). Seat5 (us) raise 160 (so we re-raise). Seat3 call 64 (call our raise). So final pot: Let's compute contributions: Seat4 (SB) 16 + 56 = 72? Actually they posted 16 then called 56 = total 72. Seat5 posted BB 32 then raised to 160, meaning they added 128 more (since they already had 32). So total from us 160. Seat3 posted 0 preflop? Actually they raised 96, then called 64 after our raise (so they put 96 + 64 = 160). So each of seat3 and seat5 contributed 160, seat4 72, seat1 0. Pot = 160+160+72 = 392 (as given). Good.\n\nNow flop: Qc 3c 7d. Action: amount to call 0, min raise 64, legal actions: fold, check. So we are in BB, we are the last to act? Actually after flop, we have option to check or bet (raise). But legal actions are fold, check only, meaning no bet allowed? That seems odd. Perhaps because we are short-stacked and the bet size would be forced? Wait: Usually after flop, you can bet any amount. But maybe the system indicates that the only legal actions are fold or check because we are all-in? Our stack is 28 chips, less than BB, but we already contributed 160 to pot, but we have 28 left? Actually after preflop, our stack is 28 chips total (including BB). But we posted BB of 32? Wait contradiction: The stack before posting blinds is 28 chips? Actually they list \"Your Stack: 28 chips (0.9 BB)\". So we have 28 chips total, less than big blind. But preflop we posted BB 32, which exceeds our stack. That seems impossible. Perhaps the stack listed is after posting BB? Actually typical representation: Stack after posting blinds? If we have 28 chips left after posting BB, then we are short-stacked. But they posted BB 32, which would be more than 28. So maybe they posted BB 32 from a larger stack, but after preflop they now have 28 left. That is plausible: Starting stack maybe larger, after posting BB we have 28 left. So we have 28 chips remaining to act. On flop, we can bet up to 28 (all-in). The system may restrict raise to 64 (minimum raise) which we cannot meet, so only check or fold. But we could go all-in (bet 28) as a raise? The rule says: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So we could raise all-in of 28. That would be a raise (bet) of 28 total (since we are putting that amount). The legal actions list only fold, check; but perhaps raise is not listed because it's not a legal action unless we have enough chips to meet min raise? However rule says you can go all-in if you can't afford min raise. So we can raise to 28 (all-in). So we need to decide.\n\nHand: Jd Ts. Flop Qc 3c 7d. No clubs?

The pot after preflop: Let's compute.\n\nBlinds: SB 16, BB 32. Preflop actions: Seat4 posts SB 16 (but seat4 is out? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, but they posted SB, but they are out? Not sure). Seat5 (us) posts BB 32.\n\nSeat1 folds. Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raises 96 (to 96 total? Actually raise to 96? Usually raise amount includes blind, but they said raise 96, maybe they put 96 total (i.e., 96-32 = 64 more). Then seat4 call 56 (calls the raise? They call 56 more? Not sure). Seat5 (us) raise 160 (so we re-raise). Seat3 call 64 (call our raise). So final pot: Let's compute contributions: Seat4 (SB) 16 + 56 = 72? Actually they posted 16 then called 56 = total 72. Seat5 posted BB 32 then raised to 160, meaning they added 128 more (since they already had 32). So total from us 160. Seat3 posted 0 preflop? Actually they raised 96, then called 64 after our raise (so they put 96 + 64 = 160). So each of seat3 and seat5 contributed 160, seat4 72, seat1 0. Pot = 160+160+72 = 392 (as given). Good.\n\nNow flop: Qc 3c 7d. Action: amount to call 0, min raise 64, legal actions: fold, check. So we are in BB, we are the last to act? Actually after flop, we have option to check or bet (raise). But legal actions are fold, check only, meaning no bet allowed? That seems odd. Perhaps because we are short-stacked and the bet size would be forced? Wait: Usually after flop, you can bet any amount. But maybe the system indicates that the only legal actions are fold or check because we are all-in? Our stack is 28 chips, less than BB, but we already contributed 160 to pot, but we have 28 left? Actually after preflop, our stack is 28 chips total (including BB). But we posted BB of 32? Wait contradiction: The stack before posting blinds is 28 chips? Actually they list \"Your Stack: 28 chips (0.9 BB)\". So we have 28 chips total, less than big blind. But preflop we posted BB 32, which exceeds our stack. That seems impossible. Perhaps the stack listed is after posting BB? Actually typical representation: Stack after posting blinds? If we have 28 chips left after posting BB, then we are short-stacked. But they posted BB 32, which would be more than 28. So maybe they posted BB 32 from a larger stack, but after preflop they now have 28 left. That is plausible: Starting stack maybe larger, after posting BB we have 28 left. So we have 28 chips remaining to act. On flop, we can bet up to 28 (all-in). The system may restrict raise to 64 (minimum raise) which we cannot meet, so only check or fold. But we could go all-in (bet 28) as a raise? The rule says: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So we could raise all-in of 28. That would be a raise (bet) of 28 total (since we are putting that amount). The legal actions list only fold, check; but perhaps raise is not listed because it's not a legal action unless we have enough chips to meet min raise?

Straight draw: we have open-ended? Actually we have J and T, board Q, so we have inside gutshot: need 9 to make 9-10-J-Q. Also need K to make 10-J-Q-K? That's not a straight because need 9-10-J-Q-K? That's 5 cards, need 9 or K? Let's list combos: With J,T, board Q, we could have straight 9-10-J-Q (needs 9). Or 10-J-Q-K (needs K). Actually 10-J-Q-K is 4 cards, need 9? No straight is 9-10-J-Q-K (needs 9 and K). So we need either 9 or K? Wait need 5 consecutive ranks. Our hand: T,J. Board: Q. So we have T,J,Q. To get 5-card straight, we need either 9 and K (9-10-J-Q-K) or 8-9-10-J-Q (need 8 and 9) or 10-J-Q-K-A (need K and A). So many outs but need two cards, not immediate. So currently no made hand. Likely a weak hand. Our stack is short, 28 chips. Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) is the only remaining player (since seat4 is out? Actually seat4 had chips 0, but they posted SB and maybe still in? They have 0 chips left after preflop? They posted SB 16, then called 56 = 72 total, but they may have had enough chips. However after preflop, seat4 may have some chips left? Not given. But they are not listed as having chips now; they are out? In players list: seat4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (out). So only seat3 remains.\n\nThus we are heads-up with DeepSeek-V3.2. Pot is 392, we have 28 left. Opponent's stack? Not shown, but they have 326 chips originally, they contributed 160 preflop, so they have 166 left (if they started with 326). So they have deeper stack.\n\nOur hand is weak; we are short-stacked. Should we go all-in? Might be a bluff. Opponent may have raised preflop and called our 3-bet, indicating strength. On flop, they may have Qx or a pair. Our J,T is not great. With only 28 chips, we could either fold (give up 0) or go all-in as a bluff. Considering tournament situation: we are short-stacked, need to double up. Bluff could be viable if opponent can fold Q-high. But opponent is likely to have Q (since they raised preflop). Could be a high card like AQ, KQ, QJ, etc. Might call. Our chances low.\n\nThus best decision: fold.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check. So we can fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So we can call (i.e., go all-in) 28 chips.\n\nWe need to decide: call all-in or fold. Hand Jd Ts, board Qc 3c 7d. No pair, no flush draw (two clubs on board: Qc, 3c; we have Jd Ts, no clubs). Straight draw? We have J T, board Q 3 7, we have open-ended straight draw? The board has Q, 3, 7. Our hand J T gives us potential to make straight if board runs 9-8-6-5? Actually need 8-9 for straight? J T 9 8 Q? That's not a straight. Let's list combos: we need 8-9 to make straight Ten-Jack-Queen? Actually sequence: 9-10-J-Q is straight, need 9. Also 10-J-Q-K? Need K. So we have gutshot: need 9 for 9-10-J-Q, also need K for 10-J-Q-K. So we have two outs (9 or K). That's 8 outs (four each). But opponent likely has a stronger hand. They raised preflop and called 3-bet, they may have a pair, broadway, etc. On flop Qc 3c 7d, they bet. Likely they have Qx, maybe a flush draw? No clubs on board, they could have club for flush draw. They could have Qc? Actually Qc is on board, they could have Qx, or a set (33, 77). They could also have overpairs like KK, AA (but they would have raised preflop). Our hand is weak.\n\nWe are extremely short, so we may be forced to go all-in anyway because calling is all-in. But we could fold and preserve 28 chips for later? But we have only 28 chips total; folding would leave us with 28 chips still, but we are out of blinds? The blinds are 16/32, we are BB, we already posted 32, but after folding we will have ",

Actually we have T, board 8-9, we have gutshot straight draw to Q? Ten needs 7 for straight? 8-9-10 gives 10, we have 10, need 7 for 7-8-9-10? Actually straight possibilities: 7-8-9-10-J, we have T, need 7 and J. Not immediate. So just overpair.\n\nOpponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) is in the big blind, called preflop raise. He checked flop. We are in BB, we raised preflop to 4 (so we are the aggressor). On flop, opponent checked. We have 9 pot (9 chips). Our stack 196. So we can bet. Options: check (pot 9, opponent can bet). Or raise (bet). Minimum raise to 2 (so bet 2). Should we bet? Overpair likely best value. Opponent's range: could include 9x, 8x, 77, 66, A9? Actually board 3-9-8, they could have 9x, 8x, T9, JT, Q9, etc. Overpair is strong. Betting small to extract value. Also consider tournament: 98 BB deep, not huge pressure. So bet 2 (pot-size ~9, bet 2 is ~22% pot). Could also bet larger like 4-5 to protect against draws? There are possible straight draws: 7-10? Actually a player could have 7J for open-ended straight draw (7-8-9-10). They could have QJ also open-ended (J-10? Actually board 8-9, QJ would need 10? QJ not straight). Straight draws: 7-10 (7-8-9-10) need 7 or J. Also 10-J (10-J-9-8) need J or Q? Actually board 8-9, you need 10-J to have open-ended? 8-9-10-J is a straight, need 10 and J. So if opponent has J10, they have a straight already? Board 8-9, they have 10-J, they have open-ended? Actually 8-9-10-J is a straight (8-9-10-J). That's four cards, need Q? No, straight is five cards, need 7? Wait a straight is 5 consecutive cards. With board 8-9, you need 7-8-9-10-J or 8-9-10-J-Q. So with J10, they'd have 8-9-10-J, missing either 7 or Q for straight. So J10 is gutshot? Actually they have 8-9-10-J, need either 7 or Q. So not a made straight.\n\nPotential draws: 7-10 (needs 7 or J). 10-J (needs 7 or Q). So some draws exist but not huge. Overpair is best.\n\nThus we raise (bet) to 2 chips (minimum). Reason: extract value from weaker hands, protect against draws.\n\nLegal actions include raise. So output.\n\n",

Board has 3-5-8-9, possible straight draws: 7-6 would give 6-7-8-9-? Not there. 6-7 would need 6 and 7; not present. So board is relatively dry. Our TT is still best likely. Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) is in the big blind, called preflop, checked flop after we bet 2 (we bet 2, they called). On turn they checked. We have pot 13, we are in BB, amount to call is 0 (since opponent checked). We can check or raise. Consider opponent's tendencies: unknown, but we have no history. Our hand is strong, but not nuts? Could be overpair to board, but board has 9,8,5,3. Opponent could have 9x, 8x, 5x, etc. Could have straight draws? Not many. Could have a set? No set possible because board has no pair. Could have two pair? 9-8? Not possible because need both on board. So we likely ahead.\n\nWe might want to extract value. Turn raise size? Minimum raise is 2 (to 4 total?). Actually raise to total 2? Wait: Minimum raise to is 2, meaning we need to raise to at least 2 chips total? The pot is 13, we have bet 0 currently. Minimum raise to 2 means we need to put 2 chips in total? That seems low relative to pot. But typical raise min is current bet + big blind? Actually maybe raise to total of 2 chips (including call). Since amount to call is 0, raising to 2 means bet 2 chips. That's a small raise. Could also raise larger.\n\nWe have deep stack 97 BB, can bet bigger for value. But opponent may call with worse. We could check to pot control but risk giving free card. However board is relatively safe; no flush draws. River will be a blank maybe.\n\nBetter to bet for value. What size? Pot 13, we could bet around half pot (6-7) or pot sized (13). Since opponent is unknown, maybe bet 6-8 chips.\n\nLegal actions: raise to any amount >=2. We have stack 194, can raise up to all-in.\n\nThus choose raise to 8 chips. Reason: we have strong overpair, want value, opponent likely has weaker hand.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Actually amount to call is 2, minimum raise to 4 means total bet 4). So raise to 4 is 2 raise over call, which is 2 BB. That's a small raise. Usually we raise 3x BB = 6. But legal actions: raise to at least 4. Could raise bigger if we want. Consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 sometimes raises preflop to 6 (observed). MiniMax-M2 hasn't raised preflop (no data). DeepSeek-V3.2 unknown. Our stack is deep, 102 BB, can afford standard raise.\n\nTdKd suited is a premium hand, good for 3-betting. In UTG, we can open raise to 5-6 chips (2.5-3 BB). The pot is 3 chips currently (SB 1, BB 2). Raising to 6 would be 3x BB, total bet 6, so raise amount 4 (since call 2). That's allowed? Minimum raise to 4, but can raise higher. So raise to 6 is okay.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: not given, but stack 102 BB, deep stack, can be aggressive.\n\nThus I will raise to 6.

It's a strong hand in early position, especially with 102 BB stack, can raise. Standard raise to 3-4 BB. Minimum raise is to 4 total (i.e., 2 raise amount? Actually amount to call is 2, minimum raise to 4 means total bet 4). So raise to 4 is 2 raise over call, which is 2 BB. That's a small raise. Usually we raise 3x BB = 6. But legal actions: raise to at least 4. Could raise bigger if we want. Consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 sometimes raises preflop to 6 (observed). MiniMax-M2 hasn't raised preflop (no data). DeepSeek-V3.2 unknown. Our stack is deep, 102 BB, can afford standard raise.\n\nTdKd suited is a premium hand, good for 3-betting. In UTG, we can open raise to 5-6 chips (2.5-3 BB). The pot is 3 chips currently (SB 1, BB 2). Raising to 6 would be 3x BB, total bet 6, so raise amount 4 (since call 2). That's allowed? Minimum raise to 4, but can raise higher. So raise to 6 is okay.\n\nWe need to consider tournament stage: not given, but stack 102 BB, deep stack, can be aggressive.\n\nThus I will raise to 6.

Actually we bet 4, then they raised to 15 (so they put in 15 total, meaning they added 11). Amount to call is 11. Minimum raise to 26 (so raise must be to at least 26 total). We have stack 194. Need decision.\n\nWe need to consider hand strength: KdTd gives us open-ended straight draw? Board Qs 9s 8h. We have Ten and King. Straight possibilities: 7-6? Actually we have 10, board 9,8, Q. With K, we have gutshot? Let's see combos: Straight draws: With KdTd, we have a gutshot to a straight: need J to make Q-J-10-9-8? Actually Q- J -10-9-8 would be straight, need J. Also need A for broadway? A Q J 10 9? No we have K not J. So only possible straight is J. Also we have a backdoor flush draw? Suits: board has two spades (Qs, 9s). Our hand has no spade, so no flush draw.\n\nWe have top pair? No Q is on board, we have K and T, no pair. We have overcards: K and T, K is over Q, T is middle.\n\nOpponent raised on flop after our bet. Could be they have Qx, maybe a set (QQ?), but board has Qs only one queen. Could be they have 9s for set? Actually board has 9s, we have no 9. So they could have 99 for set, or 88 for set, or Q? Actually Qs is on board, there is only one queen. They could have Qx for two pair? Not possible because only one queen on board. They could have straight draw like J10, or A K for gutshot? Actually they could have KJ, J9, etc.\n\nWe need to evaluate equity. Our hand: KdTd. Against unknown range, but opponent raised after our bet, maybe they have strong hand or strong draw. Our bet of 4 was small pot bet (pot 34). Opponent raises to 15 (about 3x). That could be a continuation raise with a made hand or a draw.\n\nWe have 11 to call, pot currently 34 + 4 + 15 = 53? Actually pot before opponent's raise: 34 (preflop) + our 4 = 38. Then opponent raises to 15, adding 11 more (since they already called 4? Actually they raise to 15 total, meaning they put in 15, so net addition 11). So pot after raise = 38 + 15 = 53. If we call 11, pot would be 64, we invest 11 for 53? Actually effective pot after call = 53 + 11 = 64. So pot odds: need to call 11 to win 64, about 17% required. So we need equity > 17% to be profitable.\n\nOur hand vs opponent's possible range: likely they have Qx, 99, 88, maybe J10, KJ, etc. Let's approximate: If they have Qx (top pair), they have advantage. If they have a set, we are dead. If they have straight draw J10, they have also a pair? Actually J10 would give them a gutshot (needs J). They have 10, we also have 10, but they could have J10. That would give them pair of tens plus gutshot? Actually board: Q 9 8, they have J10 => they have pair of tens, same as us, but they have J kicker, we have K kicker, we are ahead. But they'd have a gutshot to straight as well. So they might raise with pair, draws, etc.\n\nOur equity maybe around 30% vs a wide range? Hard to know. Also tournament considerations: stack 97 BB, still deep. Should we call? Might be okay.\n\nWe can also consider raising. Minimum raise to 26, which would be a raise of 26 total (so add 12 more beyond call). That would be a pot raise. That could be a semi-bluff if we have backdoor draws? Not much.\n\nBetter to call and see turn? Could be okay.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: we attempted recall but no data. So assume typical.\n\nThus I think call is appropriate.\n\nReturn JSON."

Let's reconstruct: Preflop we raised to 6 (BB raise). Opponent called 6. Flop: we bet 4 (small). Opponent raised to 15 (so 11 more). We called 11. So pot after flop call: initial pot 45? Actually given pot 45 at turn start. So after flop actions, pot is 45.\n\nNow turn card is? Not given yet; we are at turn decision, board currently Qs 9s 8h 2d, turn unknown yet? Actually board shows Qs 9s 8h 2d (that's 4 cards). So turn is 2d. So we have TdKd, board: Qs 9s 8h 2d. Our hand: Ten of diamonds and King of diamonds. We have a gutshot? Let's see possible draws: Straight draws: we have K, T. Board: Q,9,8,2. We have K and T, so possible straight combos: 10-J-Q-K? Actually we have T, board Q,9,8: we have open-ended? Let's list: 8-9-10-J-Q would be a straight if we had J. We have T, need J. So we have gutshot to straight (need J). Also we have K high, no pair. So currently we have just King high, no pair, no flush (two diamonds, board has no diamond). So we are likely behind.\n\nOpponent's range: He called preflop, then raised on flop after our small bet. He likely has strong hand: maybe top pair Q, or a set (9s?), but board has Qs 9s 8h. He raised to 15 (big). Could be a queen, a straight draw (J10), a two pair (Q9), a set (9s?), but set of 9s is impossible because board has 9s, we have no 9. Actually board has 9s, we could have 9x but not. Opp could have 9x for set? Actually set would be 9?? board has one 9, need two 9s in hand. He could have 9? He could have 9? He could have 9? Actually there is 9s on board, there are three 9s in deck. He could have two 9s, giving set. That's possible. He could also have Q? top pair. He could have straight draws like J10, or 7-6 for open-ended? Board 8-9-Q, a 7-6 gives 6-7-8-9-Q not straight. So not.\n\nOur hand is weak. Turn is 2d. Does that change? Not much.\n\nWe have 183 chips, opponent Kimi-K2 has 176 chips. Both similar stacks. Pot 45. Opp hasn't acted yet on turn. It's our action after opponent's turn? Actually order: On turn, seat 5 (us) is first? The order: BB is seat5, seat1 is UTG? Actually seat1 is Kimi-K2. On flop, we bet first, then seat1 raised, then we called. So on turn, seat5 (us) is first to act because seat1 is left of us? Actually order is clockwise from dealer. BB is seat5, seat1 is after seat5? Not sure. But given actions: \"Amount to call: 0\" meaning it's our turn and no bet yet. So we have option to check or raise. Minimum raise to 11 (so raise must be at least 11 total). Legal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot call because no bet.\n\nWe need decide: likely we should check and maybe fold later if bet. Raising could be bluff. Our hand is weak, but we could attempt a semi-bluff to take pot. Opponent likely has strong hand; raising could be called and we lose chips. However we have decent stack and could attempt a steal? But board is not particularly scary (no Ace). Opp could have Q, 9, etc. If we raise, opponent may call with many hands, causing us to lose more.\n\nThus best is to check, see opponent action. If opponent bets, we can decide to call or fold based on size. Since we have no strong hand, we likely fold to any bet.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nReasoning: weak hand, opponent likely strong, preserve stack.\n\nReturn JSON."

          "reasoning_content": "We have a hand: BB with TdKd. Board Qs 9s 8h 2d. Turn action: opponent (Seat1 Kimi-K2) bet 22 into pot 67 (pre-turn). Actually pot after flop: preflop pot 6+6+? Let's compute: Preflop: BB raised 6, K1 called 6 => pot 12 + blinds 3? Actually SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then raise to 6 (BB) means BB added 4 more? Usually raise to 6 means total contribution 6 from BB. So pot after preflop: SB 1, BB 6, K1 6 =13. Flop: BB bet 4, K1 raise to 15 (total 15), BB call 11 (so BB puts additional 11). So flop pot: previous 13 + 4 + 15 + 11 = 43? Wait need to track: after flop betting, contributions: BB 4+11=15 total on flop, K1 15. So added 30. Pot now 13+30=43. Turn: BB checked, K1 bet 22. So pot before turn bet = 43. K1 bet 22, now pot 65. Amount to call 22, min raise 44.\n\nOur hand TdKd: we have gutshot straight draw? Board Qs 9s 8h 2d. Our hand: Ten of diamonds and King of diamonds. We have open-ended straight draw? Actually we have 8-9-10-J-Q? No J missing. We have K and T. Board has Q,9,8,2. So we have gutshot to straight: need J for 8-9-10-J-Q? Actually we have 10, board 8,9,Q => need J for straight 8-9-10-J-Q. That's a gutshot (one card). Also we have backdoor flush draws? Both diamonds, board has no diamonds, so any two diamonds would give flush but only one diamond on board? Actually board has no diamonds, so we have two diamonds in hand, need three more diamonds on turn and river to make flush, unlikely.\n\nWe also have top pair? No. We have K high, but board top is Q. So we have K kicker but not a pair.\n\nThus our hand is weak. Opponent bet 22 on turn. What is opponent likely? He raised on flop after our bet. Flop board: Qs 9s 8h. He raised to 15 after our 4 bet. He could have Q, 9, 8, straight draws, two pair, etc. Turn 2d (no spade). He bets 22.\n\nWe have to decide fold, call, raise. Likely fold. But consider pot odds: pot before turn bet = 43. Opponent bet 22, pot now 65. To call 22 to win 65, pot odds ~ 22/65 = 0.338 => need ~33% equity. Our hand: we have gutshot 4 outs (J) plus maybe backdoor flush (2 diamonds in hand, need two diamonds on river). But immediate outs are J of any suit (4 outs). However some J's may be blocked by opponent's holdings? But approximate equity: 4 outs out of unknown remaining 46 cards = ~8.7% chance to hit on river. Not enough. So fold.\n\nConsider possibility of raising as bluff? Our stack 183, we could raise to 44 min. But we have weak hand, opponent likely strong, raising may be called and we lose more. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So we have gutshot straight draw (J would give straight), plus backdoor flush draw (two diamonds on board, we have none). Also we have a pair? No, we have T, not on board. So we have open-ended? Actually board Q-9-8, we have T, which is between 9 and Q? T is between 9 and J? Straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K? We have T, need J and K for higher straight. Also 8-9-10-J-Q? We have T, need J. So we have gutshot to both? Actually we have a gutshot: need J for both combos. So one-card runner (J) gives straight. Also we have a backdoor flush possibility (need two diamonds). Not strong.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) is the only remaining player; they bet 2 into pot 6 (so pot before bet 6, they bet 2 making pot 8). So they are betting small. Could be continuation bet with overcards (QJ? maybe). Could be a weak hand, maybe a draw. We have 181 chips, stack large relative to pot. Minimum raise is 4 (total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on opponent tendencies: recall shows they have called preflop once (hand 3) and then checked flop, bet turn and river. Not much data. In hand 3, they called preflop 5 (maybe a decent hand) and then checked flop (maybe weak). In other hands they fold preflop. So they might be tight? Not enough.\n\nGiven we have a weak hand, likely best to fold. But could consider calling to see cheap flop turn? Pot odds: call 2 to win pot 8+2=10? Actually pot after bet is 8, call 2 makes pot 10, we get 2/10 = 20% equity needed. Our hand has maybe ~12% chance to hit straight on turn (1/47 ~2.1%? Actually turn unknown). Wait we have only one card to improve: J for straight, also backdoor flush: need diamond on turn and river (2 cards). Probability to hit straight on turn: about 2 outs? Actually J's 4 outs, but some may be diamonds? J\u2666 also gives flush draw? Not needed. So approx 4 outs out of remaining 47 = 8.5% to hit straight on turn. If miss, could still have backdoor flush: need diamond on turn (2 diamonds left? Actually board has 2 diamonds, we have none, remaining diamonds = 13-2=11. So 11 outs for diamond on turn, then another diamond on river (10 remaining). Probability of two diamonds: (11/47)*(10/46)=~5.1%. So total equity maybe ~8.5%+5% = 13.5% approximate. That's less than 20% needed, so call not profitable.\n\nRaise? Raising to 4 would be a small raise; but we have weak hand, not good.\n\nThus fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

Calling with Ace low can be okay if we think opponent will check behind? But we are in SB, after BB and MP called, it's likely the BB will check or maybe raise later.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Situation: SB with A\u26634\u2666. Board: 2c 9c 4h. So we have top pair (pair of 4s) with Ace kicker, plus a backdoor flush draw (clubs) but only one club on board, we have Ace of clubs, so we have nut flush draw? Actually board has 2c and 9c, we have Ac, so we have two clubs, need two more clubs to make flush. Not immediate. Also we have a gutshot? Straight? 4-5-6-7-8? Not.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 called preflop (call 2) from BB? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, they are in BB? Wait seat 1 is Kimi-K2 (BB). Seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, they called 2 (big blind) preflop, meaning they are in UTG? Actually positions: SB seat5, BB seat1, seat2 is UTG? Not sure. But we have only two players: SB and BB? Actually seat1 is BB, seat4 called preflop, so seat4 is in UTG (maybe MP). So we have a multi-way? But only seat4 and seat5 are active. So it's heads-up post-flop.\n\nStack sizes: MiniMax-M2 has 212 chips. Pot 6. We are SB with 179.\n\nWe have top pair, but board is paired? No pair on board: 2c 9c 4h. We have 4h on board, we have 4d, so we have pair of 4s.\n\nOpponent's tendencies: from recall: they have called preflop with 5 chips (hand 3), then checked flop, bet turn 4, bet river 4. They also in hand 8 called preflop 1, bet flop 2. So they seem to be willing to bet on flop with maybe draws or weak hands. Not too aggressive.\n\nNow current situation: It's our turn after BB checked? Actually actions: preflop: seat5 post sb 1, seat1 post bb 2, seat4 call 2, seat5 call 1, seat1 check. So after preflop, seat1 (BB) checked. Now flop: we are SB, seat4 (MiniMax-M2) is still to act? Actually order: after flop, action starts with first active player left of button? In heads-up SB is first to act preflop, but postflop the order is SB first? Actually in heads-up, the dealer (SB) is first to act preflop, but after flop the SB is first to act. So seat5 acts first. But the log says \"Amount to call: 0\". So it's our turn, we can check or raise. Opponent hasn't acted yet.\n\nWe have top pair, decent hand. Pot is 6. Minimum raise to 2 (so raise to 2 total? Actually raise to 2 chips total, meaning bet 2). That's a small raise (size about 1/3 pot). Could also check and see what opponent does.\n\nGiven opponent may bet on flop with weak draws, we could check and induce a bet, then call or raise. But we also have decent hand, we could lead out to protect against draws. The board has two clubs; opponent could have club draws. Raising may fold out draws? A small raise might be called by draws.\n\nStack depth: we have 179, opponent 212, pot 6. We can bet ~2-3. Could also check.\n\nGiven we have top pair but vulnerable to overpairs (like 99, 22) and flush draws. But opponent's range includes many hands: could have 2c9c, 9c9x, 2c2x, etc. Our Ace kicker is good. So raising is okay.\n\nI think raise to 4 (total 4) maybe? Minimum raise is to 2, but we can raise bigger. However we need to consider tournament stack preservation. But we have big stack relative to blinds.\n\nThus I will raise to 4 chips (total). Reason: protect, get value.\n\nLegal actions: raise is allowed.\n\nThus output.",

Pocket pairs 7s are medium strength; in early stage with deep stacks, raising is common for value and to isolate. Opponent in SB is Kimi-K2 Thinking, who has shown both calls and folds, also raised to 6 in some hands (maybe 3BB). Their behavior seems mixed; they sometimes raise, sometimes fold, sometimes call. Since they are SB (tight? unknown). Our stack is deep enough to raise. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., 2 more). Usually we could raise to 6-8 to isolate. However, we must consider tournament stage: 93 BB, still early, can be aggressive. The SB's stack is 221 chips (111.5 BB). They have more chips. Raising may get them to fold if they are tight, but they have raised before. Could also just call to see flop cheap. With pocket sevens, set mining is possible but not huge; calling 2 chips for a 3 chip pot is good odds (2 to call, pot 3+2=5? Actually pot currently 3 chips (SB+BB+our call? Wait pot before our action: SB 1, BB 2, total 3. To call we need 2 more, making pot 5). Pot odds ~40% to hit set (approx 12% chance). So call is okay. Raising could build pot if we hit set, but also risk bigger loss if we get called and lose.\n\nGiven opponent's mixed behavior, a raise to maybe 6 (3BB) could be good. Minimum raise is 4 (i.e., total 4). But raise to 6 would be 3 additional chips (total 6). Is that allowed? Minimum raise to is 4, so raise must be at least 4 total. We can raise to any amount above that (subject to stack). Raising to 6 seems fine.\n\nConsider risk: If they call, pot becomes 3+ (our raise 6-2?) Wait we raise to 6 total, meaning we put 6 chips in, they already have 2 (BB) and 1 (SB). So they'd need to call 4 more (if they call). That would be a 9 chip pot preflop (1+2+6). If they re-raise, we may be in trouble.\n\nGiven we have a decent pair, I'd raise to 6 to try to isolate and get value. Reasoning: we want to build pot with a medium pair, and SB may fold or call; if they call we have good equity.\n\nThus decision: raise to 6.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have flop: board 7d 5s Tc. We have pocket sevens, so we have trips (set). Opponent (Seat2) checked. Stack sizes: we have 181 chips, opponent 190 chips. Pot 13. We are on button, we raised preflop to 6, opponent called 4 (so pot 13 includes blinds 1+2+6+4? Actually blinds 1+2 =3, our raise 6 adds 6, opponent call 4 adds 4, total 13). Flop: opponent checked. We have a very strong hand, set of sevens, top set? Board: 7,5,10. No higher pair on board, but there is a possible straight draw: 8-9 gives open-ended straight draw? Board: 7-5-10, the straight possibilities: 6-8? Actually need 6-8 for straight: 6-8-9-10? Let's list combos: With board 7,5,10, the possible straight draws: 6-8 gives 6-7-8-9-10? No 9 missing. Actually need 6-8-9? Let's compute: 6-8-9? Not. Let's think: Straight requires 5 consecutive ranks. With board 5-7-10, you could have 6-8-9? Not present. The board has 5,7,10. To have a straight, you need either 6-8-9? Not possible because need 5 cards. For example, if you have 8-9, you have 5-7-8-9-10? That's missing 6. So not a straight. The only possible straight draws are with 8-9? Actually 6-8? Let's enumerate: board ranks: 5,7,10. Potential straight combos:\n\n- 6-8: would give 5-6-7-8-? need 9 or 4? Not there. So no.\n\n- 8-9: gives 5-7-8-9-10 missing 6. No.\n\n- 4-6: 4-5-6-7-? need 8. Not there.\n\nThus board is not connected; no straight draw. However, there is a possible flush draw? Suits: 7d (diamond), 5s (spade), Tc (club). No two of same suit, so no flush draw. So we have a monster hand, likely best. Opponent checked, we can bet for value. Minimum raise is 4 (to total 4? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in? The legal actions: raise to at least 4? But we already have 0 to call. The pot is 13. We could bet 4 (which is a raise to 4 total). That seems small but fine. We could raise bigger for value. Opponent stack 190, we have 181. Likely they have a decent hand like top pair (T) or maybe a draw. We want to extract value. Since we are BTN, we can bet around half pot to pot? Minimum raise is 4, which is about 30% pot. Might want to raise more, maybe to 20-30 chips. But need to be within legal raise range: raise must be at least 4 and at most our stack? Usually raise can be any amount above min. So we can raise to say 30. That would be a bet of 30. Reasonable. We want to maximize value but not scare away. Opponent may call with T, 5, 10, maybe 7? Actually they can't have 7 because we have both sevens. So they could have Ten, maybe 10x, maybe 5x, maybe flush draws? No. So they might call with T, maybe 10-? So we can bet larger.\n\nGiven tournament early stage? Stack 90 BB, not huge but fine. So we can bet maybe 20-30. Let's choose raise to 30.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 30.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

QJ suited is a decent hand, especially suited connectors, but QJ offsuit? It's Qc Js, suited (clubs). So QcJs suited. In early position raise of 3bb (6 total) from UTG? Actually seat 3 is DeepSeek-V3.2, unknown position (Seat 3 is after SB and BB, so seat 3 is UTG? Seats: seat 1 (UTG?), seat 2 (UTG+1), seat 3 (UTG+2?), but anyway it's early position. Their raise size is 6 (3bb). Our hand is a decent speculative hand, but out of position. With 96 BB stack, we can consider 3-bet? Usually QJ suited is a marginal 3-bet candidate. Could call to see flop and try to outplay. In tournament early stage (96 BB), we can be a bit looser. The opponent's raise size is standard. We need to consider opponent's tendencies: they raised 6 previously twice (hand #3 and #17) and also raised 18 in hand #2 (maybe larger stack). No info on fold/call. Could be a standard raise.\n\nGiven we have 96 BB, calling 4 adds 4 to pot, pot becomes 13 (9+4). Implied odds? QJ suited can flop a lot of strong draws. Out of position, but can see cheap flop. Probably call is fine. Raising to 10 (minimum raise) would be a 5bb raise total, 4bb more. That would be a 3-bet of 5bb (2.5bb more than original raise). That's a bit small for 3-bet, but could be okay as a semi-bluff. However, our hand is not premium enough to 3-bet for value, and we risk being 4-beted. So better to call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nWe must output JSON.\n\n",

Our hand: Qc Js, no pair, no draw. Board has two hearts, we have no heart. So no flush draw. Straight draw? We have J and Q, board 6-4-2, we need 8-7-5-3 to make straight. Not relevant. So we have just high cards. Opponent likely has something. They raised preflop, could have many combos: broadways, suited connectors, etc. On flop, they may continuation bet. But we have no action yet: amount to call is 0? Wait legal actions: fold, check, raise. Amount to call is 0, meaning opponent hasn't bet yet? Actually we are first to act on flop? The actions list only shows preflop. On flop, maybe it's our turn to act first (since they raised preflop, they are first to act postflop). But amount to call 0 indicates they haven't bet yet. So we can check or raise. Should we check? With weak hand, likely check and hope they also check. If they bet, we can consider folding. Raising may be a bluff but we have 94 BB, deep stack. Opponent stack 193 chips, about 96 BB. Raising could be a steal? But we are out of position (BB vs opponent in earlier position). Actually we are in BB, they are seat3 (maybe UTG). On flop, action goes to seat3 first (since they were the raiser preflop). But we see amount to call 0, maybe they checked. So we have option to check or raise. With Qc Js, no equity, maybe check.

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide preflop action with 8d Jh in SB vs BB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) who posted 2 big blind. SB posted 1, so SB is first to act after BB. The BB is seat1, stack 213. They have called 2 (big blind). Actually actions: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, then seat4 (MiniMax-M2) called 2. So we are SB, amount to call is 1 (to match BB's 2? Actually pot: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, seat4 called 2, so SB's effective is 1, others 2. So to call we need to put 1 more to match the 2 big blind? Yes amount to call = 1. Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., total bet 4). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nHand 8dJh is a decent suited connector? Actually off-suit: 8d Jh, different suits (diamonds and hearts). So not suited. It's a decent hand in SB, but not premium. In early position? SB is early-ish, but only 5 players. Opponent BB may be tight? We have recall of opponent actions: from seat1 (BB) we have a history: many folds preflop, some raises of 6 (i.e., 3bb raise) and a raise of 6 again. So they raise 6 (3bb) sometimes. They also called a preflop raise of 6 (hand 7). They also raise 6 preflop on multiple occasions. They also raise 6 preflop on hand 13, 16. So they seem to be a somewhat aggressive preflop raiser (3bb). They also sometimes check and fold. They are not overly tight. They also made a raise of 6 preflop and then check flop, etc.\n\nGiven that they are BB and have just posted blind, they have not yet acted. Our decision: call 1 to see flop cheap, or raise to 4 to try to isolate? With 8Jh, it's a decent hand to see flop, especially in SB with 93 BB. Raising to 4 (total 4) would be a 2bb raise (since blind is 2). Actually minimum raise to 4 means raise to total 4 chips (i.e., 2bb raise). That is a small raise. Could be a steal? But we are SB, not a steal position because BB is already forced blind. However raising can isolate the BB and maybe also seat4 (who called) if they are still in? Actually seat4 already called 2, so they are in the pot. If we raise to 4, seat4 would need to call extra 2 to match. That might fold them, isolating us vs BB.\n\nGiven hand strength, 8Jh is not a premium hand, but can flop many straights and combos. In tournament early stage, we have deep stack (93 BB). We could call and see flop cheaply. But also we risk being out of position post-flop (we are first to act preflop, but after flop, position is after BB and seat4? Actually SB is first to act preflop, after flop the order is from UTG? In 5-handed, positions: SB, BB, UTG (seat4?), etc. Actually seat numbers: seat5 is SB, seat1 BB, seat4 is UTG? Not sure. But after flop, action starts with UTG (seat4) then BB then SB. So SB will be last to act post-flop (i.e., in position). That's good. So calling is fine.\n\nGiven opponent BB's tendency to raise 6 preflop, but they haven't yet raised. They just posted blind. So they might be passive now. So calling is likely fine.\n\nThus I think we call 1.\n\nWe must output JSON.",

Preflop: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, MiniMax called 2, SB called 1, BB checked. So flop action: after check from BB (seat1), it's now our turn (SB). Actually order: SB is seat5, after BB (seat1) checked, it's SB's turn. No bet yet. So amount to call 0, can check or raise.\n\nHand: 8d Jh, board Qs 6h 2d. No pair, no straight draw? Let's see: we have gutshot? 8-J: need 9-10 for straight? Actually 8-J: possible open-ended? With Q,6,2, we have gutshot to 9-10? 8-9-10-J-Q would be straight, need 9 and 10. Two cards needed. So no immediate draw. Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Suits: board has spades, hearts, diamonds. Our cards: 8d (diamond) and Jh (heart). So we have one diamond, one heart. Could get backdoor flush but low chance.\n\nOpponent likely has range: they called preflop from BB (big blind) after SB called. So they could have a wide range: any pair, broadway, suited connectors, etc. Board Qs 6h 2d is relatively dry. Our hand is weak. Should we check? Likely yes. Raising could be a bluff but we have a short stack? Actually we have 93 BB, deep enough. But opponent's stack similar.\n\nCheck likely best. Could also consider a small raise to steal? But opponent might have Qx or other strong hands. Raising could get called and we lose. So check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Should we fold? Usually 2J is a very weak hand, dominated by many hands, and not suited. In a tournament with 93 BB, you can afford to be selective. Likely fold.\n\nCheck if opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 (seat1 small blind) and seat2 big blind. The big blind is Kimi-K2 as well (same name). Actually seat2 is Kimi-K2 (BB). Seat1 also Kimi-K2 (SB). Both same name? Possibly same player? Might be two bots with same name. We have recall of raise patterns: they raised preflop to 6 (i.e., 3x BB) in hands #2 and #6. So they can be aggressive. But they are in BB now, they have already posted 2. If we call 2, we will see flop out of position. With 2J offsuit, not good. Could consider a steal? But we are BTN, we can raise to steal blinds. But hand is weak; raising might get called or 3-bet? However, we have deep stacks; maybe we can raise to try to steal. But 2J is not a typical stealing hand; better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

No other raises, so we can call 16 (total 20) or raise to at least 28. QJ suited is a decent hand in CO, especially suited connectors. In a tournament with 46.5 BB, we have decent stack, can play aggressively. Need to consider opponent's tendencies; we have no data. MiniMax-M2 raised from MP? Actually seat 4 is MP? Seats: 1 UTG? Not sure but seat 4 is after BB? In 5-player table, positions: Seat1 UTG, Seat2 SB, Seat3 BB, Seat4 CO? Wait seat5 is us CO, so seat4 is MP? Actually with 5 players: Seat1 UTG, Seat2 SB, Seat3 BB, Seat4 UTG+? Actually order: after BB is UTG (seat1), then CO (seat5). But seat4 is before CO, so it's MP? Anyway raise size 16 is 4x big blind, standard. QJ suited is a good hand to 3-bet or call? With 46 BB, could 3-bet to isolate and build pot. But opponent unknown. Could also call to see flop. Considering raise to 28 would be 7 BB, maybe okay. But we need to consider stack depth: 46 BB, we can afford. 3-betting could gain fold equity. QJ suited can flop strong draws. I think a 3-bet is reasonable. However we lack info on opponent's 3-bet tendencies. Could be a tight player? If they raise, they likely have strong hand, so 3-bet could be risky. But QJ suited can still play well.\n\nGiven tournament, we want chip accumulation but also preserve. I think raising to 28 (total) is good to apply pressure. Let's do raise.\n\n",

So we are first to act preflop UTG.\n\nWe need to decide fold/call/raise. Pocket pairs low (3s) are marginal. At UTG early position, typical strategy is to fold unless deep stacks and good implied odds. Stack is 39.5 BB, not huge but decent. Raising would be to 8 min raise (so 4 call, raise to 8 total). That would be a 2 BB raise. Could also raise more. But typical UTG range is tight: AA-99, AK, AQ maybe. 33 is too weak to open UTG in tournament with 39 BB. So likely fold.\n\nBut consider opponents: We have recall of opponent raises: Many raises of 6 (1.5 BB) from Kimi-K2, DeepSeek, etc. MiniMax raised to 16 (4 BB) and 65 (16.25 BB) in other hands. So they may be capable of larger raises. But we are UTG; if we raise, we may get re-raises from them, risking our stack.\n\nThus best to fold.\n\nCheck if any reason to call? Call would be 4 to see flop. With 33, you have set odds: probability of hitting set on flop ~ 11.8% (12%). Pot after call: pot 6 + 4 = 10. If you hit set, you win likely big pot. Expected value: 0.118 * win large pot vs 0.882 * lose 4. Not good given deep stack? Let's compute: If you hit set, expected win maybe about 30 chips? Not sure.

Calling the 4\u2011chip bet would leave us out of position post\u2011flop with a marginal hand, while a raise also protects our stack and gives us a chance to win the pot outright.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have Qc Jd on button, stacks 160 vs 212 and 179. Blinds 2/4, pot 6. SB 2, BB 4. It's our turn after SB and BB posted. Amount to call is 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise by at least 4 more). We need decide.\n\nWe have QJ offsuit. Position button. Stack 40 BB, decent stack. Opponents: seat1 (SB) Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 (BB) Kimi-K2. Both have similar stacks ~200. From recall, Kimi-K2 Thinking raises preflop 6 (i.e., to 6 total? Actually raise amount 6 maybe meaning raise to 6? In previous hands they raised to 6 from 4? That would be a min raise of 2? Not sure. But pattern: they raise preflop 6 often, which is a 2 BB raise (from 4 to 6). So they are likely to raise smallish.\n\nWe are on button with Qc Jd. QJ suited would be stronger; offsuit is moderate. In a 9-player? Actually 5 seats? Only 2 opponents left (SB and BB). So it's heads-up? Actually there are 5 seats total, but 2 folded, leaving 3 players: SB, BB, BTN. So it's 3-way.\n\nGiven we are button, we can open raise. QJ offsuit is a decent hand for button in 3-handed, but also could call a raise. However we face a bet of 4 (big blind). The pot is 6, effective stack 160. If we raise to 8 (minimum), that's 8 total, raising 4 more. That would be a 2 BB raise. That seems small; maybe better to raise more to isolate. With 40 BB stack, we could raise to say 20 chips (5 BB). But legal actions only include raise, not specify max. We can raise to any amount up to stack.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: SB tends to raise preflop to 6 (i.e., 2 BB) sometimes. BB also maybe call. If we raise to 8, they may call. We could also just call 4 and see flop. But calling with QJ off is okay in 3-way? Might get in trouble with overcards. But we have position.\n\nGiven tournament stage unknown, but stack 40 BB is decent, we can be aggressive. QJ offsuit has decent equity vs random, but not great vs strong. I think raise to 12 (3 BB) to isolate and build pot. But need to consider minimum raise is 8; we can raise to 12.\n\nWe should check opponent stacks: both have >200, so they can call. If they both call, pot will be 4 (our call) + 4 (SB) + 4 (BB) = 12 before raise. Actually currently SB posted 2, BB posted 4, pot 6. If we call 4, pot 10. If we raise to 12, we add 8 more (total 12). Then they'd need to call 8 more. Might be okay.\n\nGiven QJ off, I'd raise to 12 to try to take pot, but also consider that QJ offsuit is not premium, but in 3-handed it's okay. I think raise.\n\nThus action: raise to 12. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

So we face a 3-bet. Amount to call is 16 (20-4). Minimum raise to 28 (i.e., raise 8 more). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. QQ is strong, but 3-bet from seat 4 (position? seat 4 is CO? Let's map: Seats: 1,2,3,4,5 (us BB). SB is seat 4? Wait seat 4 posted sb 2. Actually preflop actions: Seat 4 post_sb 2 (so seat 4 is SB). Seat 5 post_bb 4 (us). So seat 3 is UTG? Seat 3 raise 12 (so from UTG). Seat 4 (SB) re-raises to 20 (so 3-bet from SB). So we have a 3-bet from SB after UTG opened.\n\nOur stack 162, pot 36 + 12 + 20? Actually pot after actions: blinds 2+4 =6, UTG raise 12 (so adds 12 more, total pot 18?), Actually preflop: after blinds posted, pot = 6. UTG raises to 12 (so adds 12-2? Wait UTG's raise amount is 12 total, meaning he puts 12 chips (including call of 2). So extra 10 chips. So pot = 6 + 10 = 16? Let's not worry.\n\nNow SB 3-bet to 20 (total). So we face 16 to call.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 raises small (6) often, but this time raised to 12 maybe a bit larger. MiniMax-M2 has raised 16 and 65 in previous hand, showing willingness to 3-bet bigger. Could be strong.\n\nGiven QQ, we should consider 4-bet or call. Stack 162, effective stack after call would be about 146. 4-betting could isolate and get value, but risk if opponent has AA or KK. But we have QQ, good hand to 4-bet. Minimum raise to 28, which is only 8 more (so total 28). That's a small 4-bet size relative to pot (pot before our action: 4 (our blind) + 12 (UTG) + 20 (SB) = 36? Actually pot is 2+4+12+20 = 38? Wait the posted amounts: SB posted 2 (but then also contributed to the raise?), SB posted 2, then later raises to 20, meaning he adds 18 more (total 20). BB posted 4. UTG raised to 12 (adds 10 extra). So total chips in pot before our decision: SB 20, BB 4, UTG 12 = 36. Yes pot = 36.\n\nIf we call 16, pot will be 36+16=52, we have 146 left. If we 4-bet to 28 (total), we add 24 more (since we already have 4 in pot). So we invest 24, pot becomes 36+24=60, and opponent must call 8 more (to 28) or raise.\n\nGiven typical 4-bet sizing: with deep stacks, 4-bet to around 2.5-3x the 3-bet. Here 3-bet is 20, so 4-bet maybe 50-60. But min raise is only 28, which is small; we could go all-in for 162 if we think we are ahead. But maybe better to call and see flop, as we have good equity vs many ranges.\n\nBut tournament stage: we have 162 chips, relatively short (40 BB). So preserving stack is important, but also we need chips. QQ is strong. A 4-bet could get us all-in against a 3-bet range that includes many hands. If opponent 3-bet is wide, we are likely ahead. But if they are tight, they could have AA or KK.\n\nGiven we have a short stack, maybe we should go all-in to maximize equity. But raising to min 28 is not all-in; we could raise all-in (162). Legal actions include raise; we can raise to any amount up to our stack. So we could go all-in.\n\nShould we call? If we call, we risk being outdrawn by AK etc. But we can see flop and maybe fold if out of position. However"

Better to call? However typical strategy: with 49 BB, you can call to see flop and try to outplay. But Q9 offsuit is weak, likely dominated by better queens, and can be dominated by 9x. In BTN, you could consider a 3-bet for value if opponent is loose and raises small, but Q9 is not a premium hand. Most players would fold or call.\n\nWe need opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2's raise amounts: 16, 65, 20. So sometimes raises small (16, 20) and sometimes larger (65). Not clear. Could be a standard raise. Probably not a very tight player.\n\nGiven hand Q9 offsuit, likely fold. But consider call to see flop? The raise is 16, you would be putting 12 more (since you already posted 4? Actually you haven't posted anything; you need to call 16). You have 196 stack, after call you have 180 left.

Effective stack large.\n\nKcJc suited is a decent hand, but not premium. In CO facing raise from MP? Seat 4 is MP (since CO is seat5). Opponent's tendencies: recall shows that MiniMax-M2 has raised preflop amounts 20, 16, also called, folded etc. No clear aggression pattern. Could be standard.\n\nWe must consider pot odds: call 8 to a pot of 14+8? Actually current pot is 14 (blinds) + 8 (their raise) = 22, we call 8 to win 22, pot odds ~ 27% (8/22). Hand equity vs random? KcJc suited vs random ~ 12% vs 2 players? Actually heads-up vs random ~ 12%? Wait KcJc suited vs random hand is about 12-13%? Actually KcJc suited vs random is around 12% equity. That's lower than 27%, so call is not +EV vs random. But opponent may have range narrower than random (maybe 2-3bb openers). In MP, typical opening range maybe 10% (e.g., 22+, A2s+, K9s+, Q9s+, J9s+, T9s, ATo+, KJo+). KcJc is in that range, but as a caller we are ahead of some and behind others. Equity maybe around 45% vs that range? Let's approximate: vs a typical MP opening range, KcJc suited might be about 45% equity. So call is +EV.\n\nRaising? Could 3-bet. With 49BB stack, 3-bet to maybe 24 (minimum raise to 12, but typical 3-bet size 3x raise = 24). That would be a sizable raise, but KcJc suited is a borderline 3-bet hand; could be used as a semi-bluff. Might be okay to call rather than 3-bet.\n\nGiven tournament, preserve stack. I'd call.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. So choose call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

So we are first to act (UTG). Amount to call is 4 (big blind). Minimum raise to 8 (so raise to 8 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. K9 off-suit is a marginal hand in UTG. Usually you'd fold in early position, especially in a tournament with 47 BB. However we have some information about opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) raising patterns: they have raised preflop amounts of 6 (likely a standard raise to 6, which is 1.5x big blind? Actually big blind is 4, so raise to 6 means 2 extra, which is 1.5 BB raise). Also raised 12 (maybe 3x BB). Also once raised 18 (4.5x BB). So they seem to raise a variety of sizes, possibly aggressive. Not huge data.\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted BB, no info yet.\n\nGiven UTG K9o is not strong enough to open raise. Could call? In UTG, calling the big blind is not typical; you'd either raise or fold. Calling just 4 chips (big blind) is a limp. In tournaments, limping UTG is generally not advisable. So best is to fold.\n\nThus answer: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning: hand weak, early position, risk of being out of position, stack size moderate, opponents may raise.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Wait board has 4c only one 4. We have 4d, so we have a pair of fours (pair). Actually board: 6h, Js, 4c, 2c, 3c. No other 4. So we have a pair of fours, queen kicker. Board also has a flush draw? There are three clubs on board: 4c,2c,3c. Our hand has Qs, not club. So possible opponent could have a flush (clubs) if they have two clubs. Also possible straight? Board: 2,3,4,6,J. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9? Not relevant. Straight draw maybe 5-6-7? Not. So board is relatively low.\n\nOpponent seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) is the only opponent left. They are SB? Actually seat1 posted BB 4? Wait seat5 is BB. Seat1 posted SB 2? Actually preflop: seat5 post_sb 2 (so seat5 is small blind). seat1 post_bb 4 (big blind). So seat1 is BB, seat5 is SB. So on river, after turn both checked, we are in SB (first to act? Actually after turn check, on river seat5 is first to act? In order, action proceeds from SB then BB? On each street, the first to act is the player left of the button, but after flop the SB is first. Since both checked on turn, now river, SB acts first. So we have option to bet/raise.\n\nPot is 8 chips, we have 186 stack, deep. Opponent stack 104 chips. We can bet for value or check.\n\nOur hand: pair of fours, likely weak. Opponent could have many combos: maybe Jx, 6x, 2c3c flush draw? Actually flush possible if they have two clubs: any two clubs would make a flush (5 clubs). Board has three clubs: 4c 2c 3c. So any club in hand gives at least a flush? Actually need 5 clubs total. With 2 clubs in hand + 3 on board = 5 clubs, yes flush. So opponent could have a flush. Also could have a straight? Board: 2-3-4-6-J. Straight possible with A-5? Not. 5-6-7-8-9 no. So only possible straight is 2-3-4-5-6 (needs 5). If opponent has a 5, they'd have a straight 2-3-4-5-6. That's possible. So many hands beat us.\n\nOur hand likely worst. So checking is safe. Could we bluff? Opponent may check back with weak hand. But we have little equity. The pot is small, 8 chips. A bet of maybe 4-6 could steal? Opponent may call with any pair like J, 6, etc. But they might have missed clubs and be weak. However risk of being called by flush is high. Since tournament, preserve chips. So best to check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We cannot check if we want to bet? Actually check is allowed. So we choose check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

Actually board has 4c, we have 4d, so we have a pair of fours with queen kicker. Board also has a flush draw? Board: clubs: 4c,2c,3c -> three clubs, plus we have no club. So flush possible for opponent if they have club. Straight possibilities: board 2-3-4-6-J, possible straight draws? 2-3-4-5-6 would be straight if someone has 5. We have no 5. Opponent could have 5x for straight. Also 6-7-8-9-10? No. J-high maybe.\n\nRiver bet of 6 into pot 14, so pot after bet = 20 (14+6). We need to call 6 to win 20, pot odds 6/20 = 30% needed.\n\nOur hand: pair of fours, likely weak. Opponent (Seat1) checked both preflop and flop and turn, then bets small on river. Could be a weak hand, maybe a missed draw, maybe a bluff, maybe a value bet with something like J, 6, maybe a pair of 6s, 3c? Actually board: 6h Js 4c 2c 3c. If opponent has Jx, they'd have top pair J. Might bet small. Could have 6, also pair. Could have 2c 3c for flush draw but missed; maybe they have a club for flush? No, there are 3 clubs on board, need 2 more clubs for flush, they could have two clubs, but they didn't bet earlier. Could be a bluff with missed club draw. Could also have Q? Q on board? No queen not present. So queen is high kicker.\n\nOur stack 186, opponent 98 chips. If we call, we risk 6 chips, small. If we raise, we could try to push them off. Minimum raise to 12 (i.e., raise total to 12). That would be raise of 6 extra (to 12). Opponent may call or fold. If they have weak hand they'd fold; if they have J they'd likely call? 6 chips call vs pot 14+6+? Actually after raise to 12, pot would be 14+12=26, they'd need to call 6 more. They have 98 chips, could call. Might be okay.\n\nGiven small bet, maybe we should call because pot odds good and we have some showdown value? But we are likely behind many hands. However we have queen kicker, could beat J? No, J beats us. So only hands we beat: lower pairs (2,3,6? Actually we have pair of 4s, we beat 2s,3s, maybe 6s? Wait we have 4s, board has 6, so 6s is higher pair. So we lose to 6s. We beat 2c 3c (two pair? Actually board has 2c and 3c, opponent could have 2c 3c for two pair? That would be 3c and 2c plus board 2c 3c 4c? Actually board has 2c 3c 4c, so if opponent holds 2c 3c they'd have full house? No board has only one each. So they'd have pair of 2s and 3s each? Not possible. So not relevant.\n\nWe beat any hand that is just high card, or lower pair like 2s,3s, maybe 6? No 6 higher. So limited.\n\nGiven small bet and pot odds, call seems okay. But consider tournament: we have 46.5 BB, opponent 98 chips (~24 BB). If we lose 6 chips, still fine. If we call and lose, we lose 6 chips, still fine. If we raise and they fold, we win 6 chips (pot 14+6? Actually we raise, they fold, we win pot 14). That's small gain. If they call, we risk 6 more chips, could lose more.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, best is to call the small bet, maybe even fold? But call seems okay given pot odds and we have some showdown value (pair). Also opponent's bet small could be a probe. I'd call.\n\nThus action: call, raise_to null.\n\n",

The opponent checked flop, indicating passivity. A modest raise to 8 builds the pot for our strong hand, extracts value from worse tens or sevens, and protects against draws while still being affordable for both stacks.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Board: 7c 7h Th. Our hand: 2h Ts. So we have top pair (tens) with a weak kicker (2). Also we have a backdoor straight draw? Actually with 2 and T, we have pair of tens, plus potential flush draw? We have hearts: 2h and board hearts: none (7c,7h,Th). Only hearts: Th is heart, so we have a flush draw? Actually we have 2h and Th, both hearts, so we have two hearts, board has no hearts. So we have a flush draw (need two more hearts on turn and river). Also we have a pair of tens, but board has pair of sevens. Opponent is Kimi-K2, seat 2, in BB, with 209 chips. He checked flop. We can check or raise. Consider stack sizes: we have 182 chips, opponent 209. Pot 10. Minimum raise is 4 (so raise to 4? Actually raise_to total is 4? Minimum raise to 4 means raise total to 4? Wait, we have already 4 in pot from blinds? Preflop we called 4, opponent posted 4. So pot 10 includes 4+4+2? Actually blinds: SB 2, BB 4, we called 4, so pot 10 (2+4+4). On flop, opponent checked, amount to call 0, min raise to 4 (so raise total to 4). So raising to 4 would be a small raise (bet 4). That is 0.4 BB relative to current BB 4? Actually raise to 4 means total bet 4, which is same as BB amount. So a 4 chip bet.\n\nOur hand is decent but not strong. Opponent's checking could be weak or could be drawing. We have a strong draw (flush) and a pair. Might want to bet to protect against draws and get value from worse hands like 7x, lower pair, etc. But also we could check to see a free card and possibly improve.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: We saw they checked flop 4 times in past. No raises. Likely passive, maybe checks with everything. So we can take initiative.\n\nStack depth: Both have similar stacks, 45 BB vs 52 BB. Not a huge stack. Raising small could set up pot. If we bet 4 (pot sized 10, bet 4 is 0.4 pot). Might get called by worse hands, maybe raise by stronger like a set (7s) or two pair (T7). But we have top pair, we want value. Could also be a trap.\n\nGiven we have a flush draw, we could also bet as semi-bluff. But small bet may not protect.\n\nThus I think raising to 8 (i.e., a bet of 8) could be better, but min raise is 4, but we can raise to any amount up to stack. However we need to ensure raise amount is total, not addition. So raise_to maybe 12? Actually we could raise to 12 (bet 12). But is that allowed? Yes, we can raise to any amount above minimum raise (which is 4). But we need to consider stack: we have 182 chips, opponent 209, so max we can bet is 182 (all-in). But we likely want a modest bet.\n\nGiven we have top pair, we might want to extract value. Opponent may have a weaker ten, or a 7, or a straight draw. A bet of around half pot (5) could be good. Minimum raise is 4, but we could raise to 6 or 8. Let's decide raise to 8 (i.e., bet 8). That is 0.8 pot, decent.\n\nWe need to consider pot odds for opponent: pot 10, bet 8, pot becomes 18, opponent must call 8, pot odds 8/18 ~44%. Might fold weaker draws.\n\nGiven opponent is passive, maybe they will call with any pair, but may fold draws.\n\nI think raising to 8 is reasonable.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 8, reasoning: we have top pair with a flush draw, want value and protect, opponent passive, small raise to build pot.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

In BB you can check and see flop for cheap, but with such a weak hand, maybe fold? But you already invested 4 (big blind). If you check, you see flop for free. Could be okay to see flop with 8d2d? It's a dead hand, low chance to improve (straight draws possible). Many players would just check and fold later. But could also just fold now to avoid any post-flop trouble. However checking doesn't cost chips; you still have same stack. If you fold you lose the big blind (4). If you check you get a free flop, maybe you can improve. In tournament, preserving chips is important but you already lost 4. So checking is generally standard with any hand in BB when no raise.

So raise amount would be 8 total (i.e., 4 extra). Need to decide.\n\nConsider hand: Qc Kh suited? No, Qc and Kh are offsuit (different suits). It's a decent hand, broadway, could be strong. Position: BTN, can steal blinds. Opponents: Seat1 (SB) and Seat2 (BB). We have info on Seat1 raise patterns: mostly raises of 6 (i.e., 3bb) in earlier hands, one raise of 28 (big) and one raise of 8 (2bb). So SB sometimes raises modestly. Not sure about BB.\n\nWe are facing 4 to call. Pot currently 6 (SB 2 + BB 4). If we raise to 8 (i.e., add 4), pot becomes 12 (if called). Actually raise to 8 total means we put 8 chips, raising 4 more. That would be a small raise (2bb). Could be a standard steal. Our hand QK offsuit is good for steal. Stack 46.5 BB, comfortable.\n\nWe could also consider calling (just limping) but that invites action from BB and SB. Better to raise.\n\nShould we consider a larger raise? Minimum raise is 8. Could raise more, but not given as legal? Legal actions include raise (any raise above min). We could raise to larger amount, but typical steal raise maybe 3bb (12). But we have only 4 to call, min raise to 8 is 2bb total. Actually 2bb raise is small, might be considered a \"limp-raise\"? Not typical. But we can raise bigger, like to 12 or 14.\n\nGiven opponent SB sometimes raises 6 (3bb) preflop, they may be aggressive. If they raise, they likely have strong hand. But we are acting now before them. If we raise to 8, SB may call or fold. If they call, BB may also call. Our hand QK offsuit can still be good.\n\nGiven stack size, we can afford a standard raise of 12 (3bb). That would be raise_to 12. Is that allowed? Minimum raise to 8, so raise_to 12 is fine. Should we raise to 12? Might be better to apply pressure.\n\nThus decision: raise to 12. Reason: good hand, position, steal, opponent tendencies.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We have Qc Kh on BTN. Preflop: we raised to 12 (3BB). Seat1 (Kimi) re-raised to 30 (7.5BB). Now we face a 18 call to 30 (i.e., we need to call 18 more to match 30). Minimum raise to 48 (i.e., raise to 48 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength, position (BTN), stack 174 chips (43.5 BB). Effective stack: opponent has 82 chips (20.5 BB). So we are deeper relative to opponent. Kimi's behavior: from recall, he sometimes raises preflop (hand 31 raise 28, hand 36 raise 8). So he can be aggressive. He raised to 8 (2BB) earlier, which is small. He also raised to 28 (7BB) in hand 31. He also re-raised us now to 30 (7.5BB). So likely a strong hand, maybe premium or strong broadway.\n\nOur hand Qc Kh: decent, but not premium. In BTN vs SB re-raise, typical action could be 3-bet or fold. But we already raised, now facing a 3-bet (actually a 2-bet after our raise). It's a 3-bet situation. Stack depths: opponent 82, we 174. 3-bet size 30 vs our 12 raise (so 2.5x our raise). That's a standard 3-bet. Our hand QK offsuit is a decent 3-bet candidate but can also call. However, opponent's stack is shallow (20BB). If we call, we will be in a pot of 30+12+2 (SB+BB) = 46? Actually pot currently 46 (as given). If we call, pot becomes 64 (add 18). Opponent's effective stack after call is 82-30=52 chips left. So post-flop, we would be out of position with 52 chips vs our 174-30=144 left (if we call). That is a big stack difference. Could be okay to call with QK but risk of playing out of position.\n\nAlternatively, we could 4-bet (raise to 48). Minimum raise to 48 total, which is a 3BB raise over his 30 (i.e., raise to 48 = additional 18). That's a small 4-bet, about 1.6x his 3-bet. That would be a small 4-bet, maybe as a bluff or semi-bluff. With QK, we could 4-bet as a value raise against a wide 3-bet range. But opponent's stack is short; a 4-bet to 48 would commit 48 chips (27% of his stack). He may call or shove.\n\nWe need to consider tournament: we have 43.5 BB, opponent 20.5 BB. We could try to isolate and win chips. QK is a strong hand, but not as strong as AK, AQ, JJ+. But still ahead of many 3-bet ranges. If opponent is 3-betting wide, we can 4-bet. If tight, maybe just call.\n\nGiven opponent's past raises: hand 31 raise 28 (big) then bet flop big, indicating strong hand. Hand 36 raise 8 (small) maybe a steal. So his 3-bet size 30 could be strong.\n\nThus perhaps best to call and see flop, given we are out of position but have stack advantage. However, calling gives him good implied odds to shove later. A 4-bet could isolate and perhaps win the pot preflop if he folds. If he calls, we go heads-up with a decent hand.\n\nI think 4-bet to 48 is a good move: it's a small 4-bet, but we have deep stack; we could also go all-in? Minimum raise is 48, not all-in. All-in would be 174, too big.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, preserving chips vs a potentially strong opponent: maybe call and see flop, because QK offsuit can flop a straight draw etc. But being out of position is disadvantage.\n\nI lean to raise to 48 (4-bet) as a semi-bluff/value. Reason: isolate, leverage stack advantage, and QK is ahead of many 3-bet ranges.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 48.\n\n",

Actually with A-3-4, we need a 2 or 5 for a straight. With K, we have no pair. We have backdoor flush possibilities with hearts (K\u2665? Actually we have Kh, board has 3h, so we have one heart, need two more hearts). Opponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 50 chips, SB 2. They bet 32 into pot 96 (so pot now 128 after bet). They are short stack, 50 chips left (including bet? Actually stack before bet 50, they bet 32, leaving 18). So they are short. They have 50 chips total, they bet 32, leaving 18. So they could be shoving all-in with a strong hand, but they left 18, could also be a bluff. Their betting pattern unknown; we have some recall of preflop raises: they raised small amounts (6,12,14). They are maybe aggressive. They are in SB, they posted 2, then called? Actually they raised 30 preflop after our raise to 12, they are SB. They raised to 30 (so they 3-bet). Then we called 18 (so we put 30 total? Actually we raised 12, they re-raised to 30, we called 18 to match 30). So they 3-bet preflop, indicating strength. They have a short stack 50 chips, they are in SB. They could have Aces, Kings, maybe suited connectors. On flop Ac 3h 4s, they bet 32 (which is about 2/3 pot). They could be continuation betting with Ace high, a pair of Aces, maybe a set? No set possible because board has only one Ace, one 3, one 4. They could have A2, A5, etc. They could have a gutshot straight draw (2). They could have a flush draw (hearts). They could be semi-bluffing.\n\nOur hand: K\u2665 Q\u2663. We have K high, queen, both overcards to Ace? Actually Ace is on board, so we have Ace-high? No we have K and Q, not Ace. So we have Ace on board, we have no pair. Our hand is weak. However we have a straight draw (need 2 for straight 2-3-4-5-A? Actually A-2-3-4-5 is a wheel straight, but we have no 2, we have KQ. So we need a 2 to make a straight (2-3-4-5? Actually 5 not present, but we need 5 to complete? Let's list combos: board A-3-4. Straight possibilities: A-2-3-4-5 (needs 2 and 5). Or 2-3-4-5-6 (needs 2,5,6). Or 3-4-5-6-7 (needs 5,6,7). So we have only K and Q, not helpful. So we have no straight draw. We have backdoor flush draw hearts: we have K\u2665, board has 3\u2665, need two more hearts on turn and river.\n\nThus our hand is very weak. The opponent likely has a strong hand (Ace, maybe pair of Aces, maybe a set? Not possible). Could have Ace with a kicker, maybe A2, A5, A6, etc. Could have a straight draw like 2-5? Actually 2-5 would give straight draw? 2-5 would give A-2-3-4-5 straight already? Wait board A-3-4, if they have 2-5, they have A-2-3-4-5 which is a straight (wheel). So they could have 2-5 combos. That's possible. So they could have a made straight. Also they could have a flush draw with hearts (like Ah? Actually Ace is on board, they could have Ah? That's Ace of hearts, they'd have flush draw with hearts? Actually board has only one heart, they'd need two hearts in hand for flush draw. So maybe they have hearts.\n\nGiven our weak hand, best to fold. But consider stack: we have 156 chips, opponent short. If we call 32, pot would be 128+32 = 160? Actually pot currently 96, they bet 32 making pot 128, we call 32 making pot 160, we invest 32 to possibly win 160, odds 5:1, need "

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop: we have Qc Kh, board 3h 4s Ac. So we have Ace high, a gutshot straight draw (need a 2 for straight 2-3-4-5? Actually with A-3-4, we need a 2 or 5 for a straight. With K, we have no pair. We have backdoor flush possibilities with hearts (K\u2665? Actually we have Kh, board has 3h, so we have one heart, need two more hearts). Opponent (Seat1) is Kimi-K2 Thinking, stack 50 chips, SB 2. They bet 32 into pot 96 (so pot now 128 after bet). They are short stack, 50 chips left (including bet? Actually stack before bet 50, they bet 32, leaving 18). So they are short. They have 50 chips total, they bet 32, leaving 18. So they could be shoving all-in with a strong hand, but they left 18, could also be a bluff. Their betting pattern unknown; we have some recall of preflop raises: they raised small amounts (6,12,14). They are maybe aggressive. They are in SB, they posted 2, then called? Actually they raised 30 preflop after our raise to 12, they are SB. They raised to 30 (so they 3-bet). Then we called 18 (so we put 30 total? Actually we raised 12, they re-raised to 30, we called 18 to match 30). So they 3-bet preflop, indicating strength. They have a short stack 50 chips, they are in SB. They could have Aces, Kings, maybe suited connectors. On flop Ac 3h 4s, they bet 32 (which is about 2/3 pot). They could be continuation betting with Ace high, a pair of Aces, maybe a set? No set possible because board has only one Ace, one 3, one 4. They could have A2, A5, etc. They could have a gutshot straight draw (2). They could have a flush draw (hearts). They could be semi-bluffing.\n\nOur hand: K\u2665 Q\u2663. We have K high, queen, both overcards to Ace? Actually Ace is on board, so we have Ace-high? No we have K and Q, not Ace. So we have Ace on board, we have no pair. Our hand is weak. However we have a straight draw (need 2 for straight 2-3-4-5-A? Actually A-2-3-4-5 is a wheel straight, but we have no 2, we have KQ. So we need a 2 to make a straight (2-3-4-5? Actually 5 not present, but we need 5 to complete? Let's list combos: board A-3-4. Straight possibilities: A-2-3-4-5 (needs 2 and 5). Or 2-3-4-5-6 (needs 2,5,6). Or 3-4-5-6-7 (needs 5,6,7). So we have only K and Q, not helpful. So we have no straight draw. We have backdoor flush draw hearts: we have K\u2665, board has 3\u2665, need two more hearts on turn and river.\n\nThus our hand is very weak. The opponent likely has a strong hand (Ace, maybe pair of Aces, maybe a set? Not possible). Could have Ace with a kicker, maybe A2, A5, A6, etc. Could have a straight draw like 2-5? Actually 2-5 would give straight draw? 2-5 would give A-2-3-4-5 straight already? Wait board A-3-4, if they have 2-5, they have A-2-3-4-5 which is a straight (wheel). So they could have 2-5 combos. That's possible. So they could have a made straight. Also they could have a flush draw with hearts (like Ah? Actually Ace is on board, they could have Ah? That's Ace of hearts, they'd have flush draw with hearts? Actually board has only one heart, they'd need two hearts in hand for flush draw. So maybe they have hearts.\n\nGiven our weak hand, best to fold. But consider stack: we have 156 chips, opponent short. If we call 32, pot would be 128+32 = 160? Actually pot currently 96, they bet 32 making pot 128, we call 32 making pot 160, we invest 32 to possibly win 160, odds 5:1, need ",

They just called 8 (big blind) from SB? Actually SB posted 4, BB posted 8, then seat1 and seat2 folded, seat3 called 8 (so they are in the big blind? Wait seat3 is after seat2, so they are UTG? In a 5-player? Actually seats: 1,2,3,4,5. SB is seat4, BB seat5. So seat3 is UTG (under the gun) and they called 8 (big blind). So they are a caller, not raising. Our hand 7s8s is suited connectors, decent for a raise in BB vs a single caller? With 18.5 BB, we could raise to 16 (minimum raise) to try to isolate and maybe steal. 7s8s is a decent hand for a 3-bet? Actually it's a raise, not 3-bet. The opponent just called, we are in BB and they have called. We can check (i.e., just see a flop) or raise. The pot is 20 chips (4+8+8). Raising to 16 would make pot 28, they'd need to call 8 more. Our hand has potential but not premium; we might want to see a cheap flop. However with 18.5 BB, we can afford a raise. Opponent's calling range is likely wide (they called 8). Could be suited connectors, small pairs, etc. Raising could isolate and we have position postflop (we are BB, but after flop we are out of position to the caller? Actually we are in BB and they are UTG, after flop the action will be on them first (since they are earlier seat). So raising gives us initiative but we will be out of position postflop. With 7s8s, being out of position is okay but we need good implied odds. Might just check and see a flop cheap. Stack depth is moderate; we could also raise to apply pressure, but risk folding if they 3-bet? Actually they already called; we can raise now. If they 3-bet (re-raise), they'd need to invest more. But typical play: In BB vs a single caller, raising with suited connectors is okay to try to steal blinds? But the SB already posted, and we are BB. If we raise, we are effectively stealing the pot from UTG. UTG's range is wide; they may fold to raise. So raising could be profitable. Minimum raise is 16 (total). That is 8 more than call. So raise to 16, they'd need to call 8 extra. That is a decent pressure. Considering our hand, 7s8s has decent equity vs random (around 45% vs random). So raising is good.\n\nThus choose raise to 16.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

          "content": "We have hand #43 on flop. Situation: BB with 7s8s, stack 140, blinds 4/8, pot 36. Board Qh 9h Jc. So we have open-ended straight draw (8 gives 8-9-10-J-Q? Actually we have 7-8, board Q-9-J, we have 8,7. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q (need 10) or 7-8-9-10-J (need 10). Actually we need a 10 for both. So we have a gutshot? Wait: 7-8 plus Q-9-J: The possible straight is 8-9-10-J-Q (need 10) and also 7-8-9-10-J (need 10). Both need a 10. So it's a single-card draw (one rank) with 4 outs (10s). Also we have backdoor flush draw? Suits: we have 7s8s, board has Qh 9h Jc, two hearts on board, we have spades, so no flush draw.\n\nOpponent DeepSeek-V3.2 is in seat 3, they called preflop and are now on flop. No actions yet on flop; we are first to act? Actually actions list: preflop actions ended with raise to 16 (BB raised to 16) and seat 3 called 8 (so they called the raise to 16). So pot after preflop: blinds 4+8=12, plus raise 16 total? Let's compute: preflop: SB 4, BB 8, seat3 call 8 (calls BB?), then BB raise to 16 (so adds 8 more), seat3 call 8 (calls raise). So total contributions: SB 4, BB 8+8 raise =16, seat3 8+8 =16. So pot = 4+16+16 =36 indeed.\n\nNow flop: no bets yet. It's our turn (BB) after seat3? Actually seat3 is in position UTG? The order: SB (seat4) is out, BB (seat5) is dealer? Actually seat5 is BB and also dealer? Not sure. But we have the option to check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we could check.\n\nWe have a draw with 4 outs, pot 36, we have 140 stack. Pot odds if we call a bet? Not relevant. We can consider betting to protect against draws and get value if opponent has QJ, etc. Opponent's range: they called a raise from BB preflop from SB? Actually they were in seat3 (UTG maybe) with unknown hand. They called a raise from BB to 16. So they likely have a hand that can call 16 from 208 stack (10% of stack). Could be broadway combos, suited connectors, etc. Board Qh 9h Jc is fairly coordinated. Our hand 7s8s is a gutshot. Might want to check and see if opponent bets, then decide.\n\nConsider tournament stage: stack 140 (~17.5 BB). Not huge but okay. We can try to steal pot by betting. However we have a draw; betting could give us fold equity if opponent has weak queen, etc. But we risk being called and we may be behind.\n\nWhat is opponent tendency? No data. Could recall opponent actions but none found. So assume typical.\n\nGiven we have a draw and not a made hand, checking is often correct to see free card. If opponent bets, we can call with odds: pot 36, bet maybe 16? If they bet 16, pot becomes 52, we need call 16, odds 16/52 = 30.8%. Our draw equity: 4 outs * 2 = 8% on turn, plus maybe backdoor? Actually after turn, we get two cards left; but we just consider immediate odds: If we call now and hit on turn, we have 4 outs, 2 cards left, probability of hitting on turn = 4/47 = 8.5%; if miss, we could still hit on river if another 4 outs remain: probability of hitting by river = 1 - (43/47)*(42/46) approx 4/47 + (43/47)*(4/46) = 8.5% + (91.5% * 8.7%) \u2248 8.5% + 7.96% = 16.5% total. So equity ~16.5% vs 30.8% pot odds, not good. So better to fold if bet is large. If bet is small (e.g., 8), pot odds 8/("

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #43 on flop. Situation: BB with 7s8s, stack 140, blinds 4/8, pot 36. Board Qh 9h Jc. So we have open-ended straight draw (8 gives 8-9-10-J-Q? Actually we have 7-8, board Q-9-J, we have 8,7. Straight possibilities: 8-9-10-J-Q (need 10) or 7-8-9-10-J (need 10). Actually we need a 10 for both. So we have a gutshot? Wait: 7-8 plus Q-9-J: The possible straight is 8-9-10-J-Q (need 10) and also 7-8-9-10-J (need 10). Both need a 10. So it's a single-card draw (one rank) with 4 outs (10s). Also we have backdoor flush draw? Suits: we have 7s8s, board has Qh 9h Jc, two hearts on board, we have spades, so no flush draw.\n\nOpponent DeepSeek-V3.2 is in seat 3, they called preflop and are now on flop. No actions yet on flop; we are first to act? Actually actions list: preflop actions ended with raise to 16 (BB raised to 16) and seat 3 called 8 (so they called the raise to 16). So pot after preflop: blinds 4+8=12, plus raise 16 total? Let's compute: preflop: SB 4, BB 8, seat3 call 8 (calls BB?), then BB raise to 16 (so adds 8 more), seat3 call 8 (calls raise). So total contributions: SB 4, BB 8+8 raise =16, seat3 8+8 =16. So pot = 4+16+16 =36 indeed.\n\nNow flop: no bets yet. It's our turn (BB) after seat3? Actually seat3 is in position UTG? The order: SB (seat4) is out, BB (seat5) is dealer? Actually seat5 is BB and also dealer? Not sure. But we have the option to check or raise. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we could check.\n\nWe have a draw with 4 outs, pot 36, we have 140 stack. Pot odds if we call a bet? Not relevant. We can consider betting to protect against draws and get value if opponent has QJ, etc. Opponent's range: they called a raise from BB preflop from SB? Actually they were in seat3 (UTG maybe) with unknown hand. They called a raise from BB to 16. So they likely have a hand that can call 16 from 208 stack (10% of stack). Could be broadway combos, suited connectors, etc. Board Qh 9h Jc is fairly coordinated. Our hand 7s8s is a gutshot. Might want to check and see if opponent bets, then decide.\n\nConsider tournament stage: stack 140 (~17.5 BB). Not huge but okay. We can try to steal pot by betting. However we have a draw; betting could give us fold equity if opponent has weak queen, etc. But we risk being called and we may be behind.\n\nWhat is opponent tendency? No data. Could recall opponent actions but none found. So assume typical.\n\nGiven we have a draw and not a made hand, checking is often correct to see free card. If opponent bets, we can call with odds: pot 36, bet maybe 16? If they bet 16, pot becomes 52, we need call 16, odds 16/52 = 30.8%. Our draw equity: 4 outs * 2 = 8% on turn, plus maybe backdoor?

Also we have gutshot? Actually we have 8-7, board Q J 9, we have open-ended straight draw: need 6 or T to complete straight (6-7-8-9-10? Wait board: Q J 9, we have 8 7, so we have 7-8-9-J-Q, missing 10 for straight (10-J-Q-K-A? Actually need 10 for 7-8-9-10-J? That's a straight 7-8-9-10-J). Also need 6 for 6-7-8-9-10? No board doesn't have 10, so 6 would give 6-7-8-9-? need 5? Actually 6-7-8-9-? need 5? Not. So only 10 gives straight. Wait open-ended? Let's list ranks: we have 7,8; board has 9,J,Q. The sequence 7-8-9-10-J would be straight, missing 10. Also 8-9-10-J-Q would be straight, missing 10 again. So only 10 gives straight, not open-ended but one-card draw (just 10). So it's a gutshot? Actually it's a double gutshot? No it's a single outs: only 4 tens (but some may be dead). So 4 outs, plus maybe backdoor flush? Not likely.\n\nThus hand is weak. Opponent bet 12 into pot 48, pot after bet is 60? Actually pot before bet 48, opponent bet 12, making pot 60 (including bet). To call 12, we need pot odds: call 12 to win 60 (including opponent's bet). So equity needed ~20% (12/60). Our hand equity: with 4 outs, about 4*2 =8% on turn, plus maybe 4*4=16% on river? Actually approximate: chance to hit on turn ~4/46=8.7%; if miss, chance on river ~4/45=8.9%; combined ~16.5% (ignoring turn card that could give extra outs). So about 16-17% chance to make straight, plus maybe some combos that give two pair? Our hand 7-8 with board Q-J-9, we have no pair, could make pair if 7 or 8 hits, but that's not a winning hand likely because opponent may have higher pair. So equity maybe ~15-18%. That's below 20% needed, so fold is correct.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 has bet 7 on flop earlier (hand 18) and 35 (hand 41) - both relatively sized. Could be strong. So folding is appropriate.\n\nWe have stack 140, pot 48, after bet 12, we could raise but not advisable.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have Js9c on button, 17 BB. Opponents: seat1 (SB) 214 chips, seat2 (BB) 141 chips. Both have decent stacks. We are BTN, can act after SB and BB posted. SB posted 4, BB posted 8. No other raises yet. Amount to call is 8 (big blind). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). Hand Js9c is a suited connector but not premium. At 17 BB, we are relatively short. In tournament, with 17 BB, we need to be aggressive, but also consider risk. The opponents have been raising preflop with amounts like 6,12,14,24. They seem to raise varying sizes, perhaps they raise standard 3x BB (12) often. Our hand is marginal; we could consider a raise to steal blinds, but risk being 3-bet caught. Our stack is short, but we could also call and see flop. However calling 8 puts us at 8/136 ~5.9% of stack, leaving 128 behind. That seems okay. But we risk being dominated if flop hits.\n\nGiven Js9c suited, we could raise to 24 (3x BB) to try to steal. But our raise size must be at least 16 total. If we raise to 24, that is a 3-bet (we are raising to 24, which is 3x BB). That would be a standard raise to steal. However, the BB may 3-bet us or call. Since we have short stack, we need to consider if we get called and then we are out of position preflop, but we will be in position post-flop (we are BTN). If we call, we could see flop cheap and potentially hit a straight or flush draw.\n\nGiven our stack 17 BB, we could also consider going all-in (136 chips). That would be a huge raise, but would risk losing all chips if called. Usually with suited connectors and short stack, you might push all-in to maximize fold equity. But with 17 BB, all-in is okay if you think you have fold equity. However opponents may call with better hands.\n\nI think a raise to 24 is reasonable, but maybe we can push all-in (136) to maximize. The legal actions: raise allowed. Minimum raise to 16, we can raise to any amount up to our stack. In short stack, all-in is often advisable with a hand that can win big pots if it hits. Js9c is not top tier, but can win big if it hits. However, with 17 BB, you might want to preserve chips and not commit all unless you think you have enough equity.\n\nGiven opponent tendencies: they have raised 6 (maybe 1.5x BB) earlier, and 12,14,24. They are not overly tight. Might call a raise. So a modest raise to 24 might get called, and then we are out of position preflop but we will be in position post-flop (BTN). If we get called, we will have about 112 behind after raise (24 total, we put 24, we already had 8 call, so we add 16 more). Actually we raise to 24 total, meaning we put 24 chips, which is 16 more than call. So our stack after raise is 136-24 =112. We'll be left with 112 chips, still decent.\n\nIf we call, we will be out of position? Actually after call we are still in position (BTN) because SB and BB are before us, we call 8, then flop. So calling also leaves us with 128 chips. So calling gives us more chips and we see flop cheap. That's probably better. Js9c is a speculative hand, so seeing flop cheap is good.\n\nThus best action: call 8. Reason: short stack, want to see flop cheap, suited connector can hit draws, position advantage.\n\nThus answer: call.",

Given both stacks are short, building the pot now is advantageous.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have flop: board Td 9s Ks. Our hand Js 9c gives us two pair: 9s and 9c? Actually we have a pair of nines (9c and board 9s) plus a jack, and board has Ten, King, Ten? Wait board: Td 9s Ks. So we have pair of 9s and a jack, plus a gutshot? Actually we have a straight draw? Cards: J 9. Board: T 9 K. We have J9, board T9K. So we have a pair of 9s, plus we have a gutshot straight draw: need Q for J-T? Actually straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K would be a straight, we have 9 and J, board has T and K, need Q. So we have open-ended? No, we have 9-J, board T-K, missing Q. So one-card draw.\n\nWe also have a backdoor flush? Suits: Js (spades), 9c (clubs). Board: Td (diamonds), 9s (spades), Ks (spades). Two spades on board, we have Js spade, so we have three spades (Js, 9s, Ks). One more spade on turn/river could give us flush. So potential.\n\nOur opponent Kimi-K2 in BB checked the flop. So they have checked. Their stack 141 chips, they are short (around 17.6 BB). We have 128 chips (16 BB). Both short.\n\nWe need to decide whether to bet/raise or check. Legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. Raising minimum to 8 (i.e., total 8). Pot is 20.\n\nWe have decent hand but not top pair. Could be behind many hands: Kx, Ax, Qx, maybe a set of 9s? Actually board has 9, we have pair of 9s; opponent could have 9x (set) if they have 9? Actually board has one 9, we have other 9, so set impossible because only two 9s in deck, we have one, board has one, remaining 9 is out. So opponent cannot have set. They could have two pair: Kx (K + something) gives K-K? Actually board has K, they could have Kx for top pair K, but board has K, so they have pair of Kings, that's top pair. Also could have T9 for full house? Actually board T9K, they could have T9 for two pair Tens and Nines, but we have pair of nines, they could have TT for set of tens? Board only one Ten, we could have TT for set of tens, but we don't have. Opponent could have TT (set) but board has only one Ten, they would need two Tens, impossible. So opponent could have Kx (pair of Kings), QJ for straight draw, or QK for top pair K with kicker Q. Also could have A? Not strong.\n\nGiven we have two pair (9s and J? Actually we have pair of 9s plus a jack high). That's decent but not best.\n\nCheck-raise possibility? Raising could extract value from worse hands (like Kx, T9, QJ draws). But also could be called by stronger hands (Kx). Since opponent checked, maybe they have weak hand or drawing. We can bet to protect against draws and get value.\n\nOur stack is short; raising 8 (total) puts 8 more into pot, making pot 28. Opponent can call 8, leaving them 133 chips left, still enough.\n\nWe need to consider tournament: short stacks, need to accumulate chips but also preserve.\n\nI think a raise (bet) of 8 is reasonable. Or we could check to see turn, but we have equity. I'd raise to 8.\n\nCheck if opponent is aggressive? Past actions: they check flop often, sometimes call, rarely raise. So they are passive. So a bet may get called by weaker hands.\n\nThus decision: raise to 8.\n\n",

Preflop: SB posted 4, BB posted 8, CO facing raise to 16 from seat 4 (MiniMax-M2). So action: call 16, raise minimum to 24, or fold.\n\nWe need to decide based on opponent tendencies. From recall: seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has many folds preflop, but some calls and occasional raises? Data: In hand 42, they called 16 preflop, bet 16 flop, then check turn and river, then folded river? Actually they bet flop 16, checked turn, checked river, then folded (maybe after bet). In hand 38, they called 2 preflop (maybe a small blind?), bet 4 flop. In hand 31, they bet river 35 (maybe after being in hand). So they can be aggressive postflop when they have a hand.\n\nPreflop pattern: many folds (lots of folds). Only a couple of calls (hand 42 call 16, hand 38 call 2). No raises recorded. So they likely are a tight player preflop, perhaps calling with decent hands.\n\nOur hand A3 offsuit is weak. In CO, we are late position; facing a raise from a tight player. With 18.5 BB stack, we could consider a 3-bet all-in? But hand is weak, not good for 3-bet.\n\nWe could call 16 to see flop, but with A3 it's low equity vs typical raising range of a tight player (maybe TT+, AK, AQ, maybe AJs, KQs). A3 will be dominated often.\n\nStack depth: 148 chips, after calling 16 we would have 132 left. Pot would be 28+16+16=60? Actually pot before action: 28 (includes blinds). After raise to 16, we call 16, pot becomes 28+16+16=60? Wait: the raise is 16 total? Actually seat 4 raise to 16 (so they raised 8 over BB). So amount to call is 16 (their total bet). So pot after call: 28 (existing) + 16 (their raise) + 16 (our call) = 60. That's 7.5 BB. With 148 stack, still decent.\n\nGiven hand weakness, folding is probably best. Also we are short-stacked relative to blinds? 18.5 BB is not super short, but still medium.\n\nConsider tournament stage: unknown, but we have decent stack. Preserve.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

With 17.5 BB, short stack, we could consider shove (all-in) if raise to 40 is not enough to apply pressure. Minimum raise is 40 total, which is 5 BB. Our stack 140, we could raise to 40 (5 BB) leaving 100 chips left. That's not all-in, but we could also go all-in (140). Considering hand strength, K4 suited is weak, not good for a call.

In early tournament with 17 BB, we want to preserve chips. MiniMax-M2 raise size is 2x BB, which is standard open raise. Could consider 3-bet for value? But 2's are not good for 3-bet; they'd be dominated by higher pairs and overcards. Likely fold. However we could consider a 3-bet shove? At 17 BB, 3-bet all-in would be 136 chips, but we have only 136 chips total, after posting SB 4 we have 132 left. To shove, we need to put total 136? Actually all-in includes SB posted. So we would raise to 136 (total). That's a huge raise; likely not profitable. So folding is best.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 sometimes raises larger amounts (65) maybe when short stack? Not sure. But typical open raise.\n\nThus fold.\n\n",

Wait big blind is 8, raise to 16 = 2BB). Minimum raise to 24 (3BB). So we can call 16 (i.e., put 8 more) or raise to at least 24. Hand is weak: 3-5 offsuit. Not a good hand for calling or raising. But consider stack sizes: SB 4 chips (cannot act further), BB 8 chips (already posted). They may fold to raise? The raise is from CO; SB and BB already posted and are out of position. The SB is short and will be forced to either call 16 (can't, because only 4 chips) so they'd be all-in or fold. Actually they'd need to call 12 more to match 16, but they only have 4, so they'd go all-in for 4 (i.e., they'd be all-in for 4). But they could also fold. The BB has 8 chips, need call 8 more (total 16). So they'd be all-in for 8 if they call. So the raise could be a steal attempt.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, we should fold.

Table size unknown but seats 1-5, we are seat5 (BB). So seat2 is early position relative to us. Likely a standard raise range includes many broadways, pairs, suited connectors. Q5 offsuit is not a strong hand. Fold is likely correct.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: The recall shows they have raised amounts varying from 6 to 24. In later hands they raise 24 (3BB).

Wait seat1 posted SB 4, seat5 posted BB 8. Actually seat1 is SB, seat5 is BB. So preflop actions: seat5 post SB 4? Wait they wrote \"Seat 5 post_sb 4\" meaning seat5 posted small blind? But seat5 is BB seat? Actually they may have misordered: seat5 is our seat, they posted sb 4 (so we are SB?) But earlier they said Position: BB (Seat5). In many tables, seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB. But the actions show seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So maybe seats are rotated? Anyway we are the small blind? Let's parse: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". So we are BB. The actions: seat5 post_sb 4 (contradiction). Could be a mistake; maybe they reversed. But we have to assume we are BB with 8 blind posted. The amount to call is 4, meaning the SB (seat5) posted 4, BB (seat1) posted 8. So we are SB? Actually amount to call is 4, meaning we need to call the BB's 8? Wait we have posted SB 4, then seat1 posted BB 8. So to call we need to put in 4 more to match BB (8). So amount to call = 4. Yes that matches: we posted 4, need to call 4 to match 8. So we are SB, not BB. But they said Position BB. Might be a mistake. Regardless, we are first to act preflop after the BB? Actually after blinds, action goes to UTG etc., but all others folded, so the SB acts first, then BB. Since only SB and BB are left, SB acts first. So we need to decide to call 4, raise to at least 16 (total). Hand 7h8c is suited? No it's off-suit: hearts and clubs, not suited. 7-8 offsuit is a marginal hand in SB vs BB. With 15.5 BB effective stack, we could consider raising to steal BB? But only opponent is BB (seat1). He has 194 chips, bigger stack. In SB vs BB, raising is standard. 7-8 offsuit is not a strong raise, but could be used as a steal if opponent folds. However opponent may defend wide. But given he's the BB, they might defend a wide range. But we have only 4 to call, small amount. Could also just call and see flop. But 7-8 offsuit is a speculative hand; calling cheap is okay to see flop, but we will be out of position post-flop (since BB acts first). However we have stack 124, not huge. Might be okay to call and see flop cheap. If flop hits, we could have straight draws.\n\nConsider pot odds: pot currently 12, call 4 => pot will be 16, we invest 4 for 16 pot => 25% equity needed. 7-8 offsuit vs unknown BB range (maybe 30% of hands) has maybe ~12% equity, not enough. So call is not profitable unless we expect to hit later.\n\nRaising: Minimum raise to 16 total (i.e., raise additional 8). So raise to 16 (total). That would be a raise of 8 extra beyond call (i.e., total 16). That would be 8 more than call? Actually call is 4, raise total 16 means additional 12. So we would be raising 8? Wait we have already posted 4, need to put total 16, so additional 12. That's a raise of 12. That's 3x the BB. This could pressure BB. But 7-8 offsuit is weak to raise; might be a bluff. Could be okay.\n\nGiven we have 15.5 BB, we could try to steal the BB's blind, but the BB may just call. If they call, we will be out of position with a weak hand.\n\nI think best is to fold?

With 17.5 BB, we could raise to maybe 30-40 to isolate. But we must ensure not overcommit. Opponent stack 144 chips, bigger. Raising to 30 would be 22 extra, total 30.

So we are short stack, but still 8 BB, not desperate. Hand is weak suited connectors. In SB vs BB, we can consider stealing the blind? But we are out of position post-flop. With 4h5h, potential to make straights/flush but low. Likely fold. But maybe we can call and see flop cheap? The pot is 24 (SB+BB+blinds). If we call 8, pot becomes 32, effective stack after call: we have 124 left. Opponent has 170 left (since they posted 16 from 186). So they have deeper stack. Calling is cheap but out of position. 4h5h is not a hand to call blind often, but with short stack we might want to try to see flop cheap and possibly steal later? However typical strategy: In SB with 8 BB, you may open raise to try to steal, but you have a weak hand. Raising to 32 (minimum raise) would be 32 total, i.e., raise 16 more? Actually raise to 32 total. That's a 16 raise over BB (which is 16). So raise to 32 would be 32 total (including 8 already posted). That is 16 extra. That is a small raise, maybe attempt steal? But opponent is BB with 186 chips, likely will defend often. Their raise history shows they sometimes raise preflop (maybe they are aggressive). But we don't have info on their BB defense. Could check recall for \"call\" actions? But we have raise patterns only. Might be aggressive.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, I'd fold.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise.

But 2h Js is not a good steal hand; it's a low suited connector. At BTN, can we just call and see flop? 16 call is 0.12 BB? Actually 16 is 1 BB (big blind) 1 BB. Our stack 8.2 BB, so calling 1 BB leaves us 7.2 BB. That's fine. But we risk being out of position after flop against BB. But we have position (BTN). We could call to see flop cheaply, but we have a weak hand. In tournament, with 8 BB, we can afford to limp? Typically with 8 BB you might consider raising to steal, but 2Js is not a raising hand. Might just fold.\n\nConsider opponent: Seat3 DeepSeek-V3.2 is BB with 201 chips, likely a decent stack. He may defend with wide range. If we call, we will be out of position after flop (we are BTN, but after flop we are still first to act preflop? Actually BTN is after BB preflop, but after flop, BTN is last to act (position). So we have position on BB. That's good. So calling is okay.\n\nBut 2Js is low suited, not great. Could we just fold to preserve stack? With 8 BB, you can afford to fold some hands. 2Js is not a hand to fold? Many players would fold. I'd probably fold.\n\nThus decision: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

The opponent has been checking on every street, indicating a weak or marginal hand. As a short stack (7.2 BB) I need to accumulate chips, so I will shove all",
          "reasoning_content": "We have a turn with board 8d 5s 2s Jd. Our hand 4d7s, so we have no pair, no draw (gutshot? 6 would give straight 2-5-6-7-8 but we have 4 and 7, not). We have backdoor flush possibilities? Board has two diamonds (8d,Jd) and we have 4d, so we have a flush draw with one diamond, need two more diamonds on river, low chance. Also we have a gutshot? Straight possibilities: 3-4-5-6-7 would need 3 and 6, not. So basically very weak.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) has been checking on turn repeatedly (preflop called small blind, flop checked, turn checked). So they likely have a weak hand or a draw. They could be checking with a made hand like J8? Actually board: 8d 5s 2s Jd. They could have J8 (two pair) but they'd likely bet. Checking suggests maybe they have a middle pair (8,5,2) or a draw, or just a weak hand.\n\nWe have 116 chips, 7.2 BB, short stack. Pot is 32, we have 0 to call, can check or raise. Raising could be a bluff to steal, but we are short stack, and opponent may call or raise. Minimum raise is 16, which is about 0.5 BB? Actually blind is 8/16, so raise to 16 is just a raise of 0 (??). Wait minimum raise to 16 means we need to put total 16 chips into pot, which is equal to the big blind amount. Since we have already posted BB 16, and pot currently 32 includes our BB, opponent's small blind 8 and call 8 preflop. So raising to 16 means we add 0 extra? Actually we already have 16 in pot, but raising to 16 would be just matching? This is ambiguous. Usually raise to total amount includes your existing contribution, but we have contributed 16 already, so raise to 16 means no additional chips, which is not a raise. But they list minimum raise to 16, so maybe it's raise to 32? Let's assume raise to 16 means we need to put 16 total, which is same as current bet of 0, but raise must be at least double the previous bet? Since there is no bet, minimum raise is the big blind amount (16). So raising to 32 would be adding 16 chips. So raise_to should be 32? Actually legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, we can check for free. If we raise, we need to put at least 16 chips (the big blind) as a raise, making total contribution 32 (16 more). So raise_to = 32.\n\nWe have 116 chips, can raise 32. Is a bluff worthwhile? Opponent likely has some hand; but we are short stack, need chips. If we check, we may see river for free but still weak. River card unknown. Could be a diamond giving us flush? We have 4d, board has 8d,Jd, need two more diamonds, impossible on river. So no flush. So checking likely leads to showdown losing.\n\nMaybe we should raise as a shove? But raise to 32 is not all-in; we still have 84 chips left. Could we go all-in? Not allowed unless raise is legal? We could raise more than min. Since we have 116, we could raise to 116 (all-in). Is that allowed? Yes, raise_to can be any amount up to stack. That would be a big bluff. But opponent may call if they have any decent hand (like J8, J5, J2, 8J, etc). But they have been checking, maybe they are weak. A shove could force fold many hands, giving us chips.\n\nGiven we are short stack and need to accumulate, a shove may be best. However, risk of being called by a decent hand could cost us all chips. But we have 7 BB, we need to double up. So a shove is reasonable.\n\nThus action: raise, raise_to 116 (all-in). Reasoning: short stack, weak hand, opponent checking, try to steal pot.\n\nCheck legal actions: raise is allowed. So final JSON.\n\n",

So we are after the BB (deepseek) posted 16, now it's our turn. No raises yet, just blinds posted. Amount to call 16 (the BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise by 16 more). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have 8h Jd, off-suit, not great. In BTN with 8.8 BB stack, we could consider a steal. However, we have relatively short stack; we could try to steal blind. Opponent in BB is DeepSeek-V3.2 with 418 chips (large stack). Likely they will defend with a wide range? Might be a decent defender. Also seat1 (SB) has 178 chips, but they already posted sb and are not acting now.\n\nWe could call 16 (total 32 in pot). If we call, we will be out of position post-flop with a marginal hand. Raise could be good to try to steal. Minimum raise to 32 means total 32 (i.e., raise by 16). That would be 32 total, i.e., we put 32 chips, making pot 56 (SB 8 + BB 16 + our raise 32). Actually raise to 32 total, so we add 16 more beyond call, so total bet 32 from us. That is 2 BB raise (size 2x BB). That's a standard steal size. With 8.8 BB, we can raise.\n\nGiven our hand is not premium, but still decent for a steal? J8 offsuit is not great for a raise from BTN with short stack. Might be okay as a steal but risk if called and we are out of position.\n\nConsider tournament stage: stack 140, 8.8 BB, short. Might want to try to double up by stealing blinds. But risk losing 16 chips if called and we get stuck. However, we can also just call and see flop.\n\nI think raising is appropriate to attempt steal. Opponent BB may defend with a wide range but also could have strong hands. If they call, we are in a tough spot.\n\nGiven we have only 8.8 BB, we could also go all-in (140) but that's too much. Minimum raise is 32, we can raise to 32.\n\nThus action: raise to 32.\n\nReasoning: short stack, position, attempt to steal blinds, hand not great but decent enough for a steal; raise size minimal.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Opponent DeepSeek has large stack, may 3-bet. Could also consider all-in to maximize fold equity. But 9 BB is not huge; an all-in would be 148, which is about 9 BB. Might be okay. However typical short stack strategy: push or raise? At 9 BB, many push. But we have AK, push is good. But we might also want to preserve chips if we think opponent may 3-bet and we could be forced to call all-in with AK? Actually if we push all-in, opponent can call or fold.

          "content": "We have hand #71 preflop. Position: BB (seat5). Our cards: 5c Kc (King-high suited). Stack 180 chips (11.2 BB). Blinds 8/16. Pot currently 24 (SB 8 + BB 16). Opponent seat1 is Kimi-K2, who posted BB 16 (so they are the big blind). Wait seat1 posted BB 16, seat5 posted SB 8? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Let's parse: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". The actions: preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 8. So seat5 posted small blind 8. Then seat1 post_bb 16. So seat1 is big blind. So we are in the small blind, not the big blind. The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\" but actions show seat5 posted sb. Maybe they consider seat5 as BB but posted sb because they are the BB? Actually typical: seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? But blind amounts: SB 8, BB 16. They say seat5 post_sb 8, seat1 post_bb 16. So seat5 is SB. So we are in SB with 5cKc. So we are out of position post-flop.\n\nOpponents: seat1 (Kimi-K2) is BB with 186 chips. The other seats folded.\n\nWe have to act: amount to call = 8 (the BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise to total of 32). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength, position, stack, opponent tendencies.\n\nKimi-K2's raise history: many raises preflop ranging from 6 to 24 to 113. Since the blind is 16, a raise of 24 would be to 40? Actually raise amounts given are \"amount\": e.g., raise 24. Not sure if that is total or additional. Probably the amount they raised to? In earlier data, they raise 6 (maybe to 6?). Hard to interpret. But we see they sometimes raise large (113). That suggests they are aggressive and maybe willing to shove.\n\nGiven our hand 5cKc, suited King, not premium but decent. In SB vs BB, we have 8 to call. Our stack 180, so 11 BB. If we call, we will see flop out of position. Could also raise to try to steal blind and isolate. Since we have a suited King, potential for flush and straight draws. Raising to 32 (total) is 2x BB, which is a standard raise size. Against a player who often raises, we could either call and see flop or raise to isolate.\n\nStack depth: 180 chips, about 11 BB, shallowish. In tournament, we might want to preserve stack but also pick spots.\n\nKimi-K2's pattern: they sometimes raise large, maybe 3-bet? But we are first to act after blinds; they are BB, they have not raised yet. So we can either call or raise.\n\nGiven we are SB with 5cKc, I'd consider raising to apply pressure. However, if they are likely to 3-bet all-in (like they have 113 raise previously), we could be in trouble. But 113 is huge relative to blind; maybe that was a shove later.\n\nWe have 11 BB, so a raise to 32 would be about 2 BB, which is a standard open raise from SB. Since only BB left, we could open-raise.\n\nBut we need to consider that the BB (Kimi-K2) may respond with a re-raise (3-bet). Our hand is not strong for a 3-bet. So maybe better to just call and see flop.\n\nPot odds: call 8 to win 24+? Actually pot after call would be 24 + 8 = 32? Wait pot currently 24 (SB+BB). If we call 8, pot becomes 32. So pot odds 8/32 = 25% required to break even. Our hand equity vs random range? 5cKc vs random is about 30% preflop. So calling is +EV.\n\nRaising to 32 would add 16 more to pot (so pot would be 24+8+16=48). Our raise invests 16 extra, pot odds for opponent to call 16 to win 48 = 33% needed. Opponent may fold many hands.\n\nThus raising could be good to steal BB, but we have only 8 to call. Since we have a decent hand, calling is fine.\n\nGiven we are short stacked, but not extremely short, we can call.\n\nThus choose \"call\". Reason: decent hand, good pot odds, preserve stack"

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #71 preflop. Position: BB (seat5). Our cards: 5c Kc (King-high suited). Stack 180 chips (11.2 BB). Blinds 8/16. Pot currently 24 (SB 8 + BB 16). Opponent seat1 is Kimi-K2, who posted BB 16 (so they are the big blind). Wait seat1 posted BB 16, seat5 posted SB 8? Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? Let's parse: \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". The actions: preflop: Seat 5 post_sb 8. So seat5 posted small blind 8. Then seat1 post_bb 16. So seat1 is big blind. So we are in the small blind, not the big blind. The description says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\" but actions show seat5 posted sb. Maybe they consider seat5 as BB but posted sb because they are the BB? Actually typical: seat5 is BB, seat1 is SB? But blind amounts: SB 8, BB 16. They say seat5 post_sb 8, seat1 post_bb 16. So seat5 is SB. So we are in SB with 5cKc. So we are out of position post-flop.\n\nOpponents: seat1 (Kimi-K2) is BB with 186 chips. The other seats folded.\n\nWe have to act: amount to call = 8 (the BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise to total of 32). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on hand strength, position, stack, opponent tendencies.\n\nKimi-K2's raise history: many raises preflop ranging from 6 to 24 to 113. Since the blind is 16, a raise of 24 would be to 40? Actually raise amounts given are \"amount\": e.g., raise 24. Not sure if that is total or additional. Probably the amount they raised to? In earlier data, they raise 6 (maybe to 6?). Hard to interpret. But we see they sometimes raise large (113). That suggests they are aggressive and maybe willing to shove.\n\nGiven our hand 5cKc, suited King, not premium but decent. In SB vs BB, we have 8 to call. Our stack 180, so 11 BB. If we call, we will see flop out of position. Could also raise to try to steal blind and isolate. Since we have a suited King, potential for flush and straight draws. Raising to 32 (total) is 2x BB, which is a standard raise size. Against a player who often raises, we could either call and see flop or raise to isolate.\n\nStack depth: 180 chips, about 11 BB, shallowish. In tournament, we might want to preserve stack but also pick spots.\n\nKimi-K2's pattern: they sometimes raise large, maybe 3-bet? But we are first to act after blinds; they are BB, they have not raised yet. So we can either call or raise.\n\nGiven we are SB with 5cKc, I'd consider raising to apply pressure. However, if they are likely to 3-bet all-in (like they have 113 raise previously), we could be in trouble. But 113 is huge relative to blind; maybe that was a shove later.\n\nWe have 11 BB, so a raise to 32 would be about 2 BB, which is a standard open raise from SB. Since only BB left, we could open-raise.\n\nBut we need to consider that the BB (Kimi-K2) may respond with a re-raise (3-bet). Our hand is not strong for a 3-bet. So maybe better to just call and see flop.\n\nPot odds: call 8 to win 24+? Actually pot after call would be 24 + 8 = 32? Wait pot currently 24 (SB+BB). If we call 8, pot becomes 32. So pot odds 8/32 = 25% required to break even. Our hand equity vs random range? 5cKc vs random is about 30% preflop. So calling is +EV.\n\nRaising to 32 would add 16 more to pot (so pot would be 24+8+16=48). Our raise invests 16 extra, pot odds for opponent to call 16 to win 48 = 33% needed. Opponent may fold many hands.\n\nThus raising could be good to steal BB, but we have only 8 to call. Since we have a decent hand, calling is fine.\n\nGiven we are short stacked, but not extremely short, we can call.\n\nThus choose \"call\". Reason: decent hand, good pot odds, preserve stack",

But min raise is 16, but can raise more. However we need to consider stack: opponent has 186, we have 172. Raising to 48 is okay. Could also raise to 80 (half pot). But we might want to protect against overcards? Board has 6-3-5, overcards are K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, A. Opponent could have a 6 or 3, but we are ahead. So raising is fine.\n\nI'll raise to 48 (i.e., bet 48). That's total amount we put in? Actually raise_to is total amount we are putting in. Since we have not put anything yet, raise_to = 48 means bet 48. That's okay.\n\nReturn JSON.",

Need to consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 is SB, they have raised preflop historically varying amounts 12-24-113. The sample shows they sometimes raise big (113). They have 178 chips left (short stack). Could be aggressive. DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB hasn't acted yet. No info.\n\nGiven we are BTN with a weak hand, likely fold. But also could consider a steal if SB and BB are tight. However SB is Kimi-K2 who appears aggressive (raises). But they are SB; they already posted 8, not yet acted. Actually it's our turn; we can raise to try to steal both blinds. Our stack is 204, we could raise to 32 (2 BB). That's a small raise. Might get called by BB or SB. A6 offsuit not good for showdown.\n\nThus fold is appropriate.\n\nWe must output JSON with action fold, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

With 12.8 BB, typical strategy: push or fold from UTG, especially with weak hand. A3 is not a good candidate to push; it's a weak Ace, low kicker, and suited? No, off-suit.

They have history of raising preflop with various amounts, sometimes small raises (6) and sometimes larger (30-40). They may be aggressive. MiniMax-M2 is BB with 16. Unknown tendencies. Given our short stack, if we call and get all-in from BB, we might be forced. Better to preserve chips. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop as BB with 7d Th, stack 188 chips, blinds 8/16, pot 32 (blinds + small blind call). Opponent in seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called the small blind (8) and is the only other active player. So we are heads-up in the blinds. Our hand 7T offsuit. In BB we have option to check (i.e., just call 0) or raise min to 32 (i.e., raise to 32 total). We need to consider opponent's tendencies: from recall, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has raised preflop only once in hand 67 (raise to 64). Mostly folds preflop. So they are likely tight, not aggressive. They called small blind here (8). So they likely have a hand that can call a small blind, maybe a speculative hand or a broadway. Our hand 7T is not premium but decent for heads-up. With 11.8 BB stack, we could raise to steal, but opponent already called the SB, so they are in the pot. Raising could isolate. In heads-up, 7T is a decent raising hand, especially against a tight player who may fold to raise. However we are out of position (BB) but still have position after flop? Actually we are in BB vs SB, after flop we will be out of position (SB acts first). So raising can be good to take initiative.\n\nStack depth: 188 chips, min raise to 32 (i.e., raise 16 more? Actually amount to call is 0, but minimum raise is 32 total, meaning raise to 32 chips (including the 16 BB). So raise of 16 extra chips. That's a small raise, about 2 BB. Could also raise bigger, but legal actions only mention raise (no amount). Usually raise_to is the total. We can raise to any amount above min raise, but we need to decide. Probably raise to 48 or 64 to apply pressure. But we need to consider opponent's stack: they have 148 chips. A raise to 48 would be 3 BB extra. Might be okay.\n\nGiven they just called SB, they may have a hand like suited connectors, low pairs, etc. 7T is ahead of many. Raising could be good. However we also have a short stack (11.8 BB). If we raise and get called, we will be in a post-flop situation out of position with a medium hand. Might be okay.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, preserving stack is important. But we also can try to steal. I'd lean to raise to about 48 (3x BB) to put pressure.\n\nBut we need to check legal actions: raise is allowed. So choose raise_to 48.\n\nReasoning: Hand decent, opponent tight, raise to isolate and potentially win pot preflop or get heads-up.\n\nThus output JSON.",

So we have gutshot straight draw? Let's see: we have 7 and T, board A Q 5. Potential straight combos: 8-9-10-J? Not. With T we have open-ended? Not. With 7 we could get 6-8? Not. Actually we have gutshot to straight: need 8-9 for 7-8-9-10-J? No J not present. Actually we need 8-9 to make 7-8-9-10-J? J not on board, but could be in hand? We have T, so need 8-9-J? That's not a straight. Let's consider possible draws: We have a pair? No. We have no pair. Overcards: Ace and Queen on board. Our Ten is a decent overcard to board? Not directly. Our hand is weak. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 48 into pot 144 (so pot now 192 after bet). They bet half pot. We have 156 stack, after call we would have 108 left? Actually we have 156 total, we have already invested preflop: we posted 16 BB, then raised to 48 (total 48?), wait preflop: BB posted 16, then raise to 48 (so additional 32). So we have invested 48 total preflop. Opponent called 32 to match raise, so they have 48 in pot now? Actually pot after preflop: blinds 8+16=24, plus calls and raise. Let's compute: Seat4 posted sb 8, seat5 posted bb 16, seat4 called 8 (so matches big blind?), seat5 raise to 48 (so adds 32 more), seat4 call 32 (so adds 32). So total contributions: seat4: 8+8+32 = 48. seat5: 16+32 = 48. So pot = 96 before flop. Then flop bet 48 by seat4, so pot now 144 (as given). So we need to call 48 more to stay in, our stack after preflop 156-48=108 left. So call 48 leaves us 60 chips left. So we would be short-stacked relative to opponent (they have 68 chips total). If we call, we will have 60 left vs opponent 20 left? Actually opponent has 68 total, they already invested 48, so they have 20 left. So after call, pot would be 144+48=192, we would have 60 chips left, opponent would be all-in with 20 left? Actually they'd have 20 chips left, but they could still act later? It's the flop, we act now. If we call, we will have 60, they have 20 left, they'd be short-stacked but not all-in. So we would be in position with 60 chips vs them 20.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely fold. But we might consider raising as a bluff? Minimum raise to 96 total, i.e., raise additional 48 (to 96). That would be a total contribution of 96 on flop, meaning we raise 48 more on top of call 48. That would be a 2x pot raise (pot 144). That could be a bluff, but we have only 108 chips left total; raising to 96 would leave us 12 chips left. That's a big move. Opponent has 68 chips total, 48 in pot, 20 left. If we raise to 96, they'd have to call 48 more (they have 20 left) can't call, they'd be forced to fold or go all-in for 20 (but raise to 96 is more than they can call, they'd be all-in for remaining 20). So they'd be forced to either fold or call all-in for 20 (which they'd be short). Usually they'd just fold. So raising all-in could be a bluff to win pot. But we have only 60 chips left after calling; raising all-in (i.e., 108 total) would be more than min raise? Actually we can go all-in, but we only have 108 left total. Minimum raise to 96 is allowed (since we have enough). We could go all-in for 108, which is > min raise, but raise_to must be total amount we put in? Actually raise_to is total amount we are putting in (including previous call). So if we raise to 108 (all-in), that is allowed as raise. But the legal raise minimum is 96,"

So we have gutshot straight draw? Let's see: we have 7 and T, board A Q 5. Potential straight combos: 8-9-10-J? Not. With T we have open-ended? Not. With 7 we could get 6-8? Not. Actually we have gutshot to straight: need 8-9 for 7-8-9-10-J? No J not present. Actually we need 8-9 to make 7-8-9-10-J? J not on board, but could be in hand? We have T, so need 8-9-J? That's not a straight. Let's consider possible draws: We have a pair? No. We have no pair. Overcards: Ace and Queen on board. Our Ten is a decent overcard to board? Not directly. Our hand is weak. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 48 into pot 144 (so pot now 192 after bet). They bet half pot. We have 156 stack, after call we would have 108 left? Actually we have 156 total, we have already invested preflop: we posted 16 BB, then raised to 48 (total 48?), wait preflop: BB posted 16, then raise to 48 (so additional 32). So we have invested 48 total preflop. Opponent called 32 to match raise, so they have 48 in pot now? Actually pot after preflop: blinds 8+16=24, plus calls and raise. Let's compute: Seat4 posted sb 8, seat5 posted bb 16, seat4 called 8 (so matches big blind?), seat5 raise to 48 (so adds 32 more), seat4 call 32 (so adds 32). So total contributions: seat4: 8+8+32 = 48. seat5: 16+32 = 48. So pot = 96 before flop. Then flop bet 48 by seat4, so pot now 144 (as given). So we need to call 48 more to stay in, our stack after preflop 156-48=108 left. So call 48 leaves us 60 chips left. So we would be short-stacked relative to opponent (they have 68 chips total). If we call, we will have 60 left vs opponent 20 left? Actually opponent has 68 total, they already invested 48, so they have 20 left. So after call, pot would be 144+48=192, we would have 60 chips left, opponent would be all-in with 20 left? Actually they'd have 20 chips left, but they could still act later? It's the flop, we act now. If we call, we will have 60, they have 20 left, they'd be short-stacked but not all-in. So we would be in position with 60 chips vs them 20.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely fold. But we might consider raising as a bluff? Minimum raise to 96 total, i.e., raise additional 48 (to 96). That would be a total contribution of 96 on flop, meaning we raise 48 more on top of call 48. That would be a 2x pot raise (pot 144). That could be a bluff, but we have only 108 chips left total; raising to 96 would leave us 12 chips left. That's a big move. Opponent has 68 chips total, 48 in pot, 20 left. If we raise to 96, they'd have to call 48 more (they have 20 left) can't call, they'd be forced to fold or go all-in for 20 (but raise to 96 is more than they can call, they'd be all-in for remaining 20). So they'd be forced to either fold or call all-in for 20 (which they'd be short). Usually they'd just fold. So raising all-in could be a bluff to win pot. But we have only 60 chips left after calling; raising all-in (i.e., 108 total) would be more than min raise? Actually we can go all-in, but we only have 108 left total.

Opponent seat1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (186 chips). They posted BB 16 (they are BB? Wait seat1 is BB? Actually seat1 posted bb 16. That is weird: seat5 is BB, but seat1 posted bb 16? Possibly seat1 is SB? Let's parse: Actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 8 (so seat5 is SB, not BB). Seat1 post_bb 16 (so seat1 is BB). So we are actually SB, not BB. The description says Position: BB (Seat5) but actions indicate SB. Might be a mistake. Let's trust the description: Position BB seat5, but they posted SB 8. Actually seat5 posted SB 8, meaning they are small blind. So we are in SB with Kh4h. Opponent seat1 is BB with 186 chips, they posted BB 16. So we are out of position post-flop. Stack 148, we have 9.2 BB effective.\n\nWe need to decide legal actions: fold, call, raise. Amount to call 8 (to match BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise to 32 total). So raising to 32 would be 16 more (since we have already posted 8). Our hand is weak. With 9 BB, we want to preserve stack. King-high unsuited (or suited hearts) but low kicker 4. Not a good hand to raise. Could consider a limp (call 8) to see flop cheap, but being out of position with weak hand is risky. However we are in SB with short stack; limping may get us in multi-way? Only two players left (SB and BB). If we call, we will be in the big blind's position post-flop (they act first). They have 186 chips, larger stack. They could raise on flop. With weak hand, we risk losing more. Folding might be okay.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: recall shows Kimi-K2 has raised preflop with amounts 12-24-113, seems they often raise, maybe aggressive. In this hand they just posted BB, not yet acted. They may raise on flop if they have decent hand. So calling with Kh4h is not great.\n\nGiven short stack, we could consider a raise (shove) but we only have 148 chips, min raise to 32 is small relative to stack, not all-in. Raising to 32 would be a small raise, maybe to steal blinds? But with weak hand, not advisable.\n\nThus best action: fold.

But there are two players left: SB with 202 chips, BB with 378 chips. Both have larger stacks. We are on button, can raise to try to steal. Our stack is short, but we can go all-in (148) which is about 9.25 BB total (including blinds). Minimum raise is to 32 (i.e., raise to 32 total). We could raise to maybe 48 or go all-in.\n\nConsider hand strength: 6-7 suited is a speculative hand, but can be good in short-stack push/fold scenario. In tournament, with 9 BB, many push/fold strategy: we could push all-in to apply pressure, especially from button. Opponents may call with wide ranges? SB has 202 chips (~12.6 BB) and BB 378 (~23.6 BB). Both may call all-in with decent ranges. 6-7 suited is marginal but still okay for push.\n\nGiven we have 9 BB, typical push range from button includes many suited connectors, maybe 6-7 suited is within push range. So go all-in (raise to 148). Legal actions allow raise; raise_to should be total amount we put in (including our call). All-in amount is 148 (our stack). So raise_to = 148.\n\nReasoning: short stack, button, decent suited connector, want to steal or get chips. All-in maximizes fold equity and potential to double.\n\nThus action: raise to 148.\n\n",

In BB vs a raise from UTG? Not sure position: Seat 3 is maybe UTG? Table seats: Seat 1 (??), seat 2, seat3, seat4, seat5 (us). Seat3 raised. Likely early position (maybe UTG). With short stack (9.8 BB), KTh offsuit is decent but not premium. Considering raise size 48 (3x BB). Effective stack 156, we can call 32 to see flop. Pot after call would be 72 + 48 + 32 = 152? Actually pot currently 72 includes blinds 8+16+ maybe antes? Wait pot 72 includes blinds 8+16+ maybe previous? Preflop: seat4 posted SB 8, seat5 posted BB 16, seat3 raise to 48 (so adds 48). So pot currently 8+16+48 = 72. To call 32 adds to pot 104. So pot odds: need to call 32 to win 104 (including opponent's raise). That's 30.8% needed. KTh offsuit vs unknown range; likely about 15% equity vs typical raise range (maybe 20%?). Might be a fold.\n\nAlso stack short, could consider 3-bet all-in?

All-in would be 156, but raise must be at least 80, we could raise to 156 (all-in). That would be a 3-bet all-in. Is that advisable? KTh offsuit is not a strong all-in hand vs early position raise. Likely fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: raise amounts varied: 6,12,30,40,40. So they sometimes raise small, sometimes larger. This raise is 48, which is larger than previous 40. Might indicate strong hand. So better to fold.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have data: Kimi-K2 Thinking raises varied amounts, from small 6 to huge 178 (all-in). So they can be aggressive, sometimes all-in. We have 9 BB, not huge. Raising to 32 may invite a re-raise or call. Since we are short stack, maybe we should just call and see flop? But with AQ, we have good equity. However being in blind, if we raise to 32, we risk being 3-bet all-in? Opponent may shove all-in with 178? Actually opponent's stack is 210 chips, so all-in would be 210. Our raise to 32 is small compared to that. If opponent re-raises all-in, we would be forced to call all-in with AQ, which is okay? 148 vs 210, we would be short. Might be okay.\n\nBut given we have 9 BB, we could also go all-in (148). But that is a large raise, maybe not needed. Considering tournament, preserving stack is important. AQ is strong, but not premium like AA, KK. Short stack strategy: push or fold. With 9 BB, typical push/fold threshold is around 10 BB; many push with AQ. So maybe go all-in.\n\nBut we have only 148 chips, which is 9.2 BB, we could push all-in to maximize fold equity. The opponent may call with weaker hands. So go all-in.\n\nLegal actions include raise; raise_to can be total amount. All-in would be 148 (or maybe 148 total? we already posted 16, so need to add 132 more to reach 148). But raise_to should be total amount we are putting in, i.e., 148? Usually raise_to is total bet amount. Since we have posted 16, raising to 148 means adding 132. That's fine.\n\nThus action: raise to 148 (all-in). Reason: short stack, strong hand, maximize fold equity, opponent aggressive.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

Actually preflop: SB posted 16, BB posted 32, SB called 16 (meaning they just called the BB? Wait typical: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. Then SB could raise or call. Here SB post_sb 16 (small blind). BB post_bb 32 (big blind). Then Seat 1 fold, Seat 3 fold, Seat 4 call 16 (so SB called the BB? Actually they call the big blind, so they put 16 more to match 32, making total 32 each). So now pot is 64 (2*32). No further action, it's our turn (BB). Amount to call is 0 (since SB matched). We can check or raise. With 6s3s, not a good hand, but we are short-stacked, we could consider a shove (all-in) to try to steal blind? But we are already in BB, can't steal. Raising could be a bluff attempt to win pot, but with 4.4 BB, raising to 64 (minimum) would be 32 more (since we already have 32 in pot). That would be a raise to 64 total, i.e., additional 32. That would be a 2 BB raise, still small. Might be okay as a steal attempt if opponent is tight. But we have a weak hand; raising could be okay as a bluff, but risk if opponent calls. Opponent is MiniMax-M2 with 28 chips (short stack). They already called the blind; they have 28 chips left, less than a full raise. Actually they have 28 chips total, but they've already put 32 (16 blind + 16 call). Wait they started with 28 chips total? Actually seat 4 has 28 chips at start. They posted SB 16, then called 16 more, so they have 28-32? That's impossible: they can't call more than they have. So maybe they were short-stacked and posted all-in? Actually they posted SB 16, then call 16 means they put total 32, which exceeds 28. Something off. Possibly they are all-in for 28 chips: they posted 16 blind, then called remaining 12 (so call 12). But description says call 16. Might be a mistake. Anyway, they likely are all-in or short stack. We are BB with 140 chips, could raise to 64 (i.e., 32 more). Opponent cannot call more than they have; they'd be all-in for less. Might be okay to raise and get chips. But with such weak hand, maybe just check and hope to see flop cheap? But we are already invested 32, pot 64. If we check, we see flop for free. With 6s3s, suited low connectors, could hit flush or straight draws. Short stack but still have chips. Maybe best to check and see flop.\n\nThus action: check. Reasoning: weak hand, not worth raising; check to see flop.\n\nLegal actions include check. So output.",

Actually board has 6-7-8, we have a 6, so we have middle pair? Actually board: 6,7,8. Our 6 gives us a pair of sixes, which is the lowest pair on board (6 is lowest). There are possible straight draws: board is 6-7-8, any 5 or 9 gives straight. Our hand 6s 3s gives us a pair plus a flush draw? Suits: we have two spades, board has hearts hearts diamond. No flush draw. So we have a weak hand. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) is short stacked (28 chips). Their stack is 28 chips, they are in the small blind (post_sb 16) and called preflop, so they have 12 chips left after posting? Actually they posted 16, then called 16 to match BB, so they have 28-16=12 left? Wait stack is 28 chips total. They posted 16 sb, then called 16 (so they added 16 more), total contributed 32? Actually BB is 32, they called 16 to match BB? Preflop: SB posts 16, BB posts 32. Then SB calls 16 (to match BB). So SB's total contribution is 16+16 = 32. So they have 28-32 = -4? Something off: The stack listed for seat 4 is 28 chips. That is their current stack before posting? Typically stack includes blinds? Usually the stack shown is after posting? Not sure. But they have 28 chips left after posting? Possibly they posted 16 sb and now have 12 remaining. But then they called 16 (so they would need 16 more, but they only have 12). So maybe they are all-in? But the action says they call 16, meaning they had enough chips. So perhaps the stack shown is after posting? Let's assume they have 28 chips total after posting sb? Actually typical notation: \"Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 28 chips\" is the stack before posting. Then they post sb 16, leaving 12, then call 16? That can't. So maybe they posted sb 16, then call 16, meaning they added another 16, total 32 contributed, leaving -4, impossible. So maybe they posted sb 16, then call 16 meaning they just called the BB's 32 by putting 16 (since they already posted 16). So they contributed total 32, leaving 28-32 = -4. Something inconsistent. Perhaps the stack shown is after posting? If after posting sb, they have 28 chips left, they then call 16, leaving 12. That would make sense: initial stack 44, posted 16, left 28, then call 16, left 12. But we don't know. Anyway they are short stacked, maybe around 12 chips left.\n\nPot is 64 chips. We have 140 chips. Opponent is short, may be willing to go all-in.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely we should check and possibly fold to a bet. Since amount to call is 0, we can check. Legal actions include raise. Raising would be aggressive, but we have weak hand. Opponent may have a straight or better. So check.\n\nThus output: action check, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Suits: we have spades 6s 3s, board has hearts hearts diamonds spade Jack. No spade on board except J\u2660, so we have a flush draw with J\u2660? Actually we have spades, board has J\u2660, so we have two spades in hand, one spade on board, need two more spades to flush, not currently. Straight possibilities: board 6-7-8, we have 6, we could make 5-6-7-8-9 straight if a 5 or 9 appears. Not immediate.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) seat 4, stack 28 chips (short stack). They have checked turn after flop check. So they have 28 chips left, likely all-in? Minimum raise is 32, but they have only 28, cannot raise. So they are short stack, maybe they will go all-in later. The pot is 64. We have 140 chips, 4.4 BB. We are in big blind with short stack opponent in the small blind? Actually seat 4 posted sb 16, seat5 posted bb 32. So opponent is SB with 28 chips left (so they are very short). They checked turn, meaning they have 0 chips left? Wait they posted 16 sb, then called 16 preflop (so they added 16 more, total 32). Then after flop and turn they checked, but they have 28 chips left. How could they have 28 chips left after posting 32? Actually they started with 28 chips total? The description says seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 28 chips (maybe that's their current stack). They posted sb 16 (so they had 28, posted 16, left 12). Then preflop they called 16 (so they added 16, but they only had 12 left? Something off). Possibly the stack numbers are after posting? Let's interpret: Seat4 stack is 28 chips before posting? They posted sb 16, then called 16, total 32 contributed, which exceeds 28. So maybe the stack numbers are after posting? Actually after posting sb 16, they have 12 left. They called 16, which would be all-in for 12, but they can't call 16. Something inconsistent. Might be that seat4's stack is 28 after posting sb? So they posted 16, leaving 12, then they call 16 meaning they go all-in for remaining 12, but the call amount is 16, but they can only call 12, they'd be all-in and the pot would be adjusted. But the logs show they called 16, maybe they had more chips originally. Anyway they are short.\n\nGiven we have 140 chips, we could consider raising to put pressure. Our hand is weak: just a pair of sixes, board is 6-7-8-J, opponent could have 9,5 for straight, could have 7-8 for trips, could have J? Actually they could have 9-5 for straight (9-8-7-6-5), also could have 5-9, also could have 7-7 for trips, 8-8 for trips, 6-6 for set (but we have a six, so they can't have another six? Actually there are four sixes, we have 6s, board has 6h, so remaining sixes are 6c and 6d. Opponent could have 6c6d for quads? Unlikely.\n\nWe have short stack opponent checking; they might be trying to get to showdown cheap. Our stack is also shortish 140, but we have 4.4 BB, we could try to steal. But raising might be risky because opponent could have a stronger hand and call all-in (they have 28 left). Minimum raise is 32, but opponent only has 28, so they cannot call a raise; they could go all-in for 28 and we would be facing a raise of 28? Actually raise to 32 is total, we would put 32 in, opponent can call all-in for 28? In practice, you can raise to 32, opponent can call all-in for 28, they'd be all-in for 28, you'd have 4 extra in pot. But if you raise to 32, you are putting 32 chips, leaving you 108. That might be okay.\n\nBut what is our best action? Since opponent is short, we could consider raising"

They have checked turn after flop check. So they have 28 chips left, likely all-in? Minimum raise is 32, but they have only 28, cannot raise. So they are short stack, maybe they will go all-in later. The pot is 64. We have 140 chips, 4.4 BB. We are in big blind with short stack opponent in the small blind? Actually seat 4 posted sb 16, seat5 posted bb 32. So opponent is SB with 28 chips left (so they are very short). They checked turn, meaning they have 0 chips left? Wait they posted 16 sb, then called 16 preflop (so they added 16 more, total 32). Then after flop and turn they checked, but they have 28 chips left. How could they have 28 chips left after posting 32? Actually they started with 28 chips total? The description says seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 28 chips (maybe that's their current stack). They posted sb 16 (so they had 28, posted 16, left 12). Then preflop they called 16 (so they added 16, but they only had 12 left? Something off). Possibly the stack numbers are after posting? Let's interpret: Seat4 stack is 28 chips before posting? They posted sb 16, then called 16, total 32 contributed, which exceeds 28. So maybe the stack numbers are after posting? Actually after posting sb 16, they have 12 left. They called 16, which would be all-in for 12, but they can't call 16. Something inconsistent. Might be that seat4's stack is 28 after posting sb? So they posted 16, leaving 12, then they call 16 meaning they go all-in for remaining 12, but the call amount is 16, but they can only call 12, they'd be all-in and the pot would be adjusted. But the logs show they called 16, maybe they had more chips originally. Anyway they are short.\n\nGiven we have 140 chips, we could consider raising to put pressure. Our hand is weak: just a pair of sixes, board is 6-7-8-J, opponent could have 9,5 for straight, could have 7-8 for trips, could have J? Actually they could have 9-5 for straight (9-8-7-6-5), also could have 5-9, also could have 7-7 for trips, 8-8 for trips, 6-6 for set (but we have a six, so they can't have another six? Actually there are four sixes, we have 6s, board has 6h, so remaining sixes are 6c and 6d. Opponent could have 6c6d for quads? Unlikely.\n\nWe have short stack opponent checking; they might be trying to get to showdown cheap. Our stack is also shortish 140, but we have 4.4 BB, we could try to steal. But raising might be risky because opponent could have a stronger hand and call all-in (they have 28 left). Minimum raise is 32, but opponent only has 28, so they cannot call a raise; they could go all-in for 28 and we would be facing a raise of 28? Actually raise to 32 is total, we would put 32 in, opponent can call all-in for 28? In practice, you can raise to 32, opponent can call all-in for 28, they'd be all-in for 28, you'd have 4 extra in pot. But if you raise to 32, you are putting 32 chips, leaving you 108. That might be okay.\n\nBut what is our best action? Since opponent is short, we could consider raising",

Opponent likely has something better? Board is quite coordinated: possible straight draws: 9T would give straight 6-7-8-9-T? Actually board 5-6-7-8-J, straight possibilities: 4-5-6-7-8 (needs 4), 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 9), 6-7-8-9-T (needs 9,T), 7-8-9-T-J (needs 9,T). So many combos. Opponent could have a straight, two pair, set (6 or 8), or flush draw missed. Our pair is likely losing. Check is safe? If we check, we may win if opponent also checks with missed draws. But opponent checking suggests maybe weak hand. However board is scary; many hands beat us. Should we consider betting? We have short stack 4.4 BB, but still 140 chips, pot 64, raising to 32 (minimum) is a half-pot bet. Could be a bluff. Opponent only 28 chips left (short stack).

But they'd be forced to call all-in with maybe a weak hand? They checked, maybe they are weak and will fold to a bet. So betting could win 28 chips. But we risk opponent calling with a better hand? But they are short, maybe they call with any pair? If they have a pair like 8-8, they'd call. But they might be okay to call because they have 28 chips, pot 64, they'd be getting good odds (call 28 to win 64+32=96? Actually if we bet 32, pot becomes 96, they call 28, they'd be all-in for 28, they'd win 96 if they have best hand. That's 28 to win 96 ~ 29% chance, they might call with decent equity.

Actually seat1 posted BB 32, seat5 posted SB 16. So seat5 is SB? The description says Position: BB (Seat5). But they posted SB 16. Possibly small blind is seat5, big blind seat1. So we are SB? But they say Position: BB (Seat5). Might be reversed due to numbering. Regardless, we are the small blind (post 16) and big blind posted 32. So amount to call is 16 (to match big blind). Minimum raise to 64 (i.e., raise to 64 total). Hand Qc4d is very weak. Should we fold? In a tournament with 5.9 BB stack, we are short stacked. We could consider shove (all-in) to try to double up, but with Q4 offsuit it's weak. However with 5.9 BB, you may need to be aggressive. But Q4 is not a good candidate for shove; typical push range from SB with 6 BB includes maybe any ace, broadway, suited connectors, etc. Q4 offsuit is likely not in optimal push range.

But actions show seat4 call 28, maybe they called a raise? The sequence: seat1 post_sb 16, seat3 post_bb 32, seat4 call 28. So seat4 must be a player in seat4 (but earlier said out). Probably seat4 is a player with 0 chips? Anyway they called 28 maybe a raise from seat1? Actually seat1 posted SB 16, then seat3 posted BB 32, then seat4 call 28. That suggests seat4 is a player in the big blind? Not sure. But amount to call is 32, min raise to 64.\n\nWe are BTN with 4T off-suit. Very weak hand, especially short stack. Should we fold? Consider that we have 5.9 BB, we could consider stealing blind with raise, but 4T is not a good raising hand. Short stack: you could push all-in (188) to try to double up. But raise to 64 is min raise; we could raise to maybe 64 or go all-in. Need to consider opponent tendencies: Seat1 Kimi-K2 (SB) has been raising preflop with amounts 12-24 and one huge 113. That suggests they may be aggressive and possibly push with a range. Seat3 DeepSeek-V3.2 is BB with 498 chips. No data yet. Our hand is weak, but we could consider folding to preserve stack. At 5.9 BB, folding is safe but you lose opportunity. However, 4T offsuit is not a steal-worthy hand; typical steal range from BTN is broader (A2+, K9+, Q9+, J9+, T9, 98, 87, etc). 4T is far below.

Calling 64 would require >24% equity, which JTs likely doesn't have against an UTG opener. An all\u2011in raise maximizes fold equity and, if called, our hand has decent equity (~30%+) against a typical raise range.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with Jd Ts, stack 156 (4.9 BB). Big blind 32, small blind 16. Action: SB (seat4) posted 16, BB posted 32. Seat1 folded, seat3 (DeepSeek) raised to 96 (so raise of 64 over BB). Seat4 (MiniMax) called 56? Wait seat4 is SB, they called 56 (i.e., they put 56 total, meaning they called 40 more? Actually SB posted 16, to call raise to 96 they need 80 more, but they called 56? That seems odd. Probably seat4 is out of chips? But they have 0 chips out. Hmm seat4 out. Maybe seat4 is out and they can't call. But the log says seat4 call 56. Anyway amount to call is 64 (to match 96). So we need to decide: fold, call 64, or raise min to 160 (total). Our stack 156, cannot raise to 160 (needs 160 total, we have 156). So we could go all-in for 156 (which is less than min raise). That's allowed as all-in.\n\nWe have Jd Ts, suited connectors, decent for short stack. In BB with 4.9 BB, raise from UTG (DeepSeek) to 96 (3 BB). Actually 96 is 3 BB? Wait BB is 32, so 96 is 3 BB. So they raised 3BB. That's a standard open raise size. As BB we are short stacked, we could consider 3-bet all-in to try to steal or get equity. JTs is a decent hand for 3-bet vs unknown opponent. Our stack is 156, so all-in would be 156 total, which is 4.875 BB. That's a decent raise. Opponent's raise size is 96, we could call 64 to see flop, but with 4.9 BB we risk being forced all-in later. Better to go all-in now? Let's consider opponent tendencies: recall shows DeepSeek often raises small amounts (6,12,30,40,48). Those are relative to blinds? Not sure. In earlier hands, they raise 6 (maybe 0.5BB), 12 (1BB), 30 (0.94?), but not consistent. In recent hand 78 they raised 48 (1.5BB). But this hand they raised 96 (3BB). So they may be opening bigger when short stacked. We have JTs, which is a decent hand but not premium. Against a raise from UTG (seat3) we are out of position. With 4.9 BB we could call and hope to hit a straight/flush. But call 64 puts us at 120 total (still short). Could be fine.\n\nWhat is the pot odds? Pot currently 200 + 96 raise? Actually pot before our action: SB 16, BB 32, raise 96 (adds 96 to pot). So pot now 200 (as given). To call 64, we invest 64 to win 200+64? Actually after we call, pot will be 200+64 = 264. So odds: 64/264 = 24% to win 264. So need equity >24% to call. JTs vs unknown range (maybe 10-15%?). Likely less than 24% preflop. So call not justified. Raise all-in could be a semi-bluff. If opponent folds, we win 200. If they call, we are all-in with JTs vs their range. Our equity vs typical raise range (maybe 15% of hands) could be around 30-35% maybe. So expected value maybe positive.\n\nThus best action: raise all-in (156 total). Legal actions include raise but min raise to 160, we can't meet min, but we can go all-in. So action: raise with raise_to 156.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

The pot after preflop: Let's compute.\n\nBlinds: SB 16, BB 32. Preflop actions: Seat4 posts SB 16 (but seat4 is out? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, but they posted SB, but they are out? Not sure). Seat5 (us) posts BB 32.\n\nSeat1 folds. Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raises 96 (to 96 total? Actually raise to 96? Usually raise amount includes blind, but they said raise 96, maybe they put 96 total (i.e., 96-32 = 64 more). Then seat4 call 56 (calls the raise? They call 56 more? Not sure). Seat5 (us) raise 160 (so we re-raise). Seat3 call 64 (call our raise). So final pot: Let's compute contributions: Seat4 (SB) 16 + 56 = 72? Actually they posted 16 then called 56 = total 72. Seat5 posted BB 32 then raised to 160, meaning they added 128 more (since they already had 32). So total from us 160. Seat3 posted 0 preflop? Actually they raised 96, then called 64 after our raise (so they put 96 + 64 = 160). So each of seat3 and seat5 contributed 160, seat4 72, seat1 0. Pot = 160+160+72 = 392 (as given). Good.\n\nNow flop: Qc 3c 7d. Action: amount to call 0, min raise 64, legal actions: fold, check. So we are in BB, we are the last to act? Actually after flop, we have option to check or bet (raise). But legal actions are fold, check only, meaning no bet allowed? That seems odd. Perhaps because we are short-stacked and the bet size would be forced? Wait: Usually after flop, you can bet any amount. But maybe the system indicates that the only legal actions are fold or check because we are all-in? Our stack is 28 chips, less than BB, but we already contributed 160 to pot, but we have 28 left? Actually after preflop, our stack is 28 chips total (including BB). But we posted BB of 32? Wait contradiction: The stack before posting blinds is 28 chips? Actually they list \"Your Stack: 28 chips (0.9 BB)\". So we have 28 chips total, less than big blind. But preflop we posted BB 32, which exceeds our stack. That seems impossible. Perhaps the stack listed is after posting BB? Actually typical representation: Stack after posting blinds? If we have 28 chips left after posting BB, then we are short-stacked. But they posted BB 32, which would be more than 28. So maybe they posted BB 32 from a larger stack, but after preflop they now have 28 left. That is plausible: Starting stack maybe larger, after posting BB we have 28 left. So we have 28 chips remaining to act. On flop, we can bet up to 28 (all-in). The system may restrict raise to 64 (minimum raise) which we cannot meet, so only check or fold. But we could go all-in (bet 28) as a raise? The rule says: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So we could raise all-in of 28. That would be a raise (bet) of 28 total (since we are putting that amount). The legal actions list only fold, check; but perhaps raise is not listed because it's not a legal action unless we have enough chips to meet min raise? However rule says you can go all-in if you can't afford min raise. So we can raise to 28 (all-in). So we need to decide.\n\nHand: Jd Ts. Flop Qc 3c 7d. No clubs?

The pot after preflop: Let's compute.\n\nBlinds: SB 16, BB 32. Preflop actions: Seat4 posts SB 16 (but seat4 is out? Actually seat4 is MiniMax-M2, but they posted SB, but they are out? Not sure). Seat5 (us) posts BB 32.\n\nSeat1 folds. Seat3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) raises 96 (to 96 total? Actually raise to 96? Usually raise amount includes blind, but they said raise 96, maybe they put 96 total (i.e., 96-32 = 64 more). Then seat4 call 56 (calls the raise? They call 56 more? Not sure). Seat5 (us) raise 160 (so we re-raise). Seat3 call 64 (call our raise). So final pot: Let's compute contributions: Seat4 (SB) 16 + 56 = 72? Actually they posted 16 then called 56 = total 72. Seat5 posted BB 32 then raised to 160, meaning they added 128 more (since they already had 32). So total from us 160. Seat3 posted 0 preflop? Actually they raised 96, then called 64 after our raise (so they put 96 + 64 = 160). So each of seat3 and seat5 contributed 160, seat4 72, seat1 0. Pot = 160+160+72 = 392 (as given). Good.\n\nNow flop: Qc 3c 7d. Action: amount to call 0, min raise 64, legal actions: fold, check. So we are in BB, we are the last to act? Actually after flop, we have option to check or bet (raise). But legal actions are fold, check only, meaning no bet allowed? That seems odd. Perhaps because we are short-stacked and the bet size would be forced? Wait: Usually after flop, you can bet any amount. But maybe the system indicates that the only legal actions are fold or check because we are all-in? Our stack is 28 chips, less than BB, but we already contributed 160 to pot, but we have 28 left? Actually after preflop, our stack is 28 chips total (including BB). But we posted BB of 32? Wait contradiction: The stack before posting blinds is 28 chips? Actually they list \"Your Stack: 28 chips (0.9 BB)\". So we have 28 chips total, less than big blind. But preflop we posted BB 32, which exceeds our stack. That seems impossible. Perhaps the stack listed is after posting BB? Actually typical representation: Stack after posting blinds? If we have 28 chips left after posting BB, then we are short-stacked. But they posted BB 32, which would be more than 28. So maybe they posted BB 32 from a larger stack, but after preflop they now have 28 left. That is plausible: Starting stack maybe larger, after posting BB we have 28 left. So we have 28 chips remaining to act. On flop, we can bet up to 28 (all-in). The system may restrict raise to 64 (minimum raise) which we cannot meet, so only check or fold. But we could go all-in (bet 28) as a raise? The rule says: \"If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\". So we could raise all-in of 28. That would be a raise (bet) of 28 total (since we are putting that amount). The legal actions list only fold, check; but perhaps raise is not listed because it's not a legal action unless we have enough chips to meet min raise? However rule says you can go all-in if you can't afford min raise. So we can raise to 28 (all-in). So we need to decide.\n\nHand: Jd Ts. Flop Qc 3c 7d. No clubs?

Straight draw: we have open-ended? Actually we have J and T, board Q, so we have inside gutshot: need 9 to make 9-10-J-Q. Also need K to make 10-J-Q-K? That's not a straight because need 9-10-J-Q-K? That's 5 cards, need 9 or K? Let's list combos: With J,T, board Q, we could have straight 9-10-J-Q (needs 9). Or 10-J-Q-K (needs K). Actually 10-J-Q-K is 4 cards, need 9? No straight is 9-10-J-Q-K (needs 9 and K). So we need either 9 or K? Wait need 5 consecutive ranks. Our hand: T,J. Board: Q. So we have T,J,Q. To get 5-card straight, we need either 9 and K (9-10-J-Q-K) or 8-9-10-J-Q (need 8 and 9) or 10-J-Q-K-A (need K and A). So many outs but need two cards, not immediate. So currently no made hand. Likely a weak hand. Our stack is short, 28 chips. Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) is the only remaining player (since seat4 is out? Actually seat4 had chips 0, but they posted SB and maybe still in? They have 0 chips left after preflop? They posted SB 16, then called 56 = 72 total, but they may have had enough chips. However after preflop, seat4 may have some chips left? Not given. But they are not listed as having chips now; they are out? In players list: seat4: MiniMax-M2 - 0 chips (out). So only seat3 remains.\n\nThus we are heads-up with DeepSeek-V3.2. Pot is 392, we have 28 left. Opponent's stack? Not shown, but they have 326 chips originally, they contributed 160 preflop, so they have 166 left (if they started with 326). So they have deeper stack.\n\nOur hand is weak; we are short-stacked. Should we go all-in? Might be a bluff. Opponent may have raised preflop and called our 3-bet, indicating strength. On flop, they may have Qx or a pair. Our J,T is not great. With only 28 chips, we could either fold (give up 0) or go all-in as a bluff. Considering tournament situation: we are short-stacked, need to double up. Bluff could be viable if opponent can fold Q-high. But opponent is likely to have Q (since they raised preflop). Could be a high card like AQ, KQ, QJ, etc. Might call. Our chances low.\n\nThus best decision: fold.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check. So we can fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So we can call (i.e., go all-in) 28 chips.\n\nWe need to decide: call all-in or fold. Hand Jd Ts, board Qc 3c 7d. No pair, no flush draw (two clubs on board: Qc, 3c; we have Jd Ts, no clubs). Straight draw? We have J T, board Q 3 7, we have open-ended straight draw? The board has Q, 3, 7. Our hand J T gives us potential to make straight if board runs 9-8-6-5? Actually need 8-9 for straight? J T 9 8 Q? That's not a straight. Let's list combos: we need 8-9 to make straight Ten-Jack-Queen? Actually sequence: 9-10-J-Q is straight, need 9. Also 10-J-Q-K? Need K. So we have gutshot: need 9 for 9-10-J-Q, also need K for 10-J-Q-K. So we have two outs (9 or K). That's 8 outs (four each). But opponent likely has a stronger hand. They raised preflop and called 3-bet, they may have a pair, broadway, etc. On flop Qc 3c 7d, they bet. Likely they have Qx, maybe a flush draw? No clubs on board, they could have club for flush draw. They could have Qc? Actually Qc is on board, they could have Qx, or a set (33, 77). They could also have overpairs like KK, AA (but they would have raised preflop). Our hand is weak.\n\nWe are extremely short, so we may be forced to go all-in anyway because calling is all-in. But we could fold and preserve 28 chips for later? But we have only 28 chips total; folding would leave us with 28 chips still, but we are out of blinds? The blinds are 16/32, we are BB, we already posted 32, but after folding we will have ",

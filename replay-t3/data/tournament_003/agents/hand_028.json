            "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my hand: 9d 2d in UTG position with 212 chips (53 BB). This is a very weak hand - 9-2 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- To call: 4 chips\n- Minimum raise: 8 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nFrom the opponent actions I can see:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been raising preflop with some frequency (hands 26 and 27)\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Called a raise in hand 27, then bet on flop and river\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Seems to fold frequently\n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Hand strength**: 9d 2d is extremely weak. It's unsuited, disconnected, and low. This hand has very little potential even if I hit something.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. If I call or raise, I have to act first on all subsequent streets with a weak hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 212 chips (53 BB) - This is a healthy stack. I don't need to take risks with garbage hands.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack, I should be selective and wait for better spots. Playing 9-2 UTG is a recipe for trouble.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I'd have to call 4 chips to win 6. Even with these odds, the hand is just too weak to continue.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: The players behind me have shown aggression (Seat 2 raises, Seat 4 bets postflop). With a weak hand in bad position, I'm likely to face pressure.\n\nConclusion: This is a clear fold. 9-2 offsuit UTG is a standard fold in any situation, and with my stack size and opponent tendencies, there's no justification to play this hand.",

The SB (seat 4, MiniMax-M2) posted 2, BB (seat 5, GPT-OSS-120B) posted 4. Both players folded, so action is on me.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Has shown some aggression - called a raise of 10 preflop in hand 27, bet on flop and river. Has folded to some raises preflop. Shows KJo in hand 27.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Has raised preflop a few times (hand 21 raised to 28, hand 23 raised to 12, hand 25 raised to 12). Shows some aggression but also folds often.\n\nMy options: fold, call, or raise. With A5s on the button, raising is standard. Calling is also okay but raising puts pressure on the blinds. I have position advantage.\n\nFrom my hand history, I've been playing tight - folded many hands. Won hand 26 with A9o from BB. My win rate is 22%.\n\nPot odds: need to call 4 to win 6, so 1:1.5. But if I raise, I can take it down preflop or play in position.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 52.5 BB, which is healthy. The blinds have 49.25 BB (197 chips) and 40.5 BB (162 chips). I have them covered.\n\nStandard play here is to raise with A5s on button. I should raise to 12-16 chips (3-4x BB). Minimum raise is to 8, but that's only 2x BB, which is small. I'll raise to 12 (3x BB).\n\nLet me check if there's any reason to be cautious. The BB has shown some aggression with raises, but they're in the BB defending. The SB is in the SB. Both could defend, but I have position.\n\nI think raising is correct. Let's do a 3x raise to 12."

            "content": "Let me check GPT-OSS-120B's stack size and behavior. From the search results, I see GPT-OSS-120B has been playing some hands. In hand #23, they raised preflop from the BB with what we don't know. In hand #25, they raised from UTG. Now they have only 4 chips left and are going all-in.\n\nCurrent situation: I'm on the button with Ac5c. I raised to 12 (3x BB). MiniMax-M2 3-bet to 20 (5x BB). GPT-OSS-120B has only 4 chips total, so their \"raise\" to 162 is essentially an all-in with their remaining stack (they had 4 chips, posted BB of 4, so they have 0 left? Wait, they posted BB of 4, so they started with 4 chips, posted 4, then raised to 162? That doesn't make sense mathematically. Let me check: Seat 5 has 4 chips. They posted BB of 4, so they have 0 chips left. But they \"raised\" to 162. This must be an all-in situation where they're putting in their remaining 4 chips total? Actually, the action says \"preflop: Seat 5 raise 162\" but they only have 4 chips. This is confusing.\n\nLet me think: The pot is 194 chips. Amount to call is 150. My stack is 198. If I call 150, I'll have 48 chips left. Minimum raise to 304, which I can't do since I only have 198 total.\n\nGPT-OSS-120B has only 4 chips. Their \"raise\" to 162 must be an all-in with their tiny stack. They're essentially going all-in for their last 4 chips after posting the BB.\n\nActually, let me reconstruct: Starting stacks: GPT-OSS-120B has 4 chips. They post BB of 4, so they have 0 left. Then I raise to 12. MiniMax-M2 raises to 20. Now GPT-OSS-120B goes all-in for their remaining... wait they have 0. But the action says \"raise 162\". This is probably a display issue - they're going all-in for their last chips.\n\nPot calculation: SB (2) + BB (4) + my raise (12) + MiniMax-M2's raise (20) + GPT-OSS-120B all-in (their remaining). The pot is 194. Amount for me to call is 150. That means GPT-OSS-120B put in 162 total? Let me do math: 2+4+12+20 = 38. Pot is 194, so GPT-OSS-120B added 156? Actually 194-38=156. But they only had 4 chips. Something's off.\n\nWait, maybe GPT-OSS-120B had more than 4 chips? Let me check the player list again: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 4 chips\". So they have 4 chips. They posted BB of 4, so they're all-in. Their \"raise\" to 162 is probably a system display of their all-in amount including previous bets.\n\nActually, the amount to call is 150. I put in 12 initially. MiniMax-M2 raised to 20 (8 more). GPT-OSS-120B went all-in. To call, I need to match the largest bet, which is GPT-OSS-120B's all-in of 162 total. I've put in 12, so I need to add 150 more.\n\nBut GPT-OSS-120B only has 4 chips! How can they bet 162? This must be that the 162 includes the BB they already posted. So: They posted BB of 4, then went all-in for their remaining 0? Actually no, they have 4 total, posted 4 as BB, so they have 0 left. They can't raise. Unless... they had 4 chips, posted BB of 4, then when it's their turn, they go all-in for their last 0? That doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe the stack display is wrong, or GPT-OSS-120B actually has more chips. Let me check previous hands. In hand #27, they folded preflop. In hand #26, they folded preflop. In hand #25, they raised to 12. In hand #24, they folded. In hand #23, they raised to 12. So they've been playing somewhat aggressively when they have chips.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume GPT-OSS-120B is all-in with a very short stack, probably 4 chips or similar.\n\nNow, my decision: I have Ac5c suited. It's a decent hand"

If I call 150, I'll have 48 chips left. Minimum raise to 304, which I can't do since I only have 198 total.\n\nGPT-OSS-120B has only 4 chips. Their \"raise\" to 162 must be an all-in with their tiny stack. They're essentially going all-in for their last 4 chips after posting the BB.\n\nActually, let me reconstruct: Starting stacks: GPT-OSS-120B has 4 chips. They post BB of 4, so they have 0 left. Then I raise to 12. MiniMax-M2 raises to 20. Now GPT-OSS-120B goes all-in for their remaining... wait they have 0. But the action says \"raise 162\". This is probably a display issue - they're going all-in for their last chips.\n\nPot calculation: SB (2) + BB (4) + my raise (12) + MiniMax-M2's raise (20) + GPT-OSS-120B all-in (their remaining). The pot is 194. Amount for me to call is 150. That means GPT-OSS-120B put in 162 total? Let me do math: 2+4+12+20 = 38. Pot is 194, so GPT-OSS-120B added 156? Actually 194-38=156. But they only had 4 chips. Something's off.\n\nWait, maybe GPT-OSS-120B had more than 4 chips? Let me check the player list again: \"Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 4 chips\". So they have 4 chips. They posted BB of 4, so they're all-in. Their \"raise\" to 162 is probably a system display of their all-in amount including previous bets.\n\nActually, the amount to call is 150. I put in 12 initially. MiniMax-M2 raised to 20 (8 more). GPT-OSS-120B went all-in. To call, I need to match the largest bet, which is GPT-OSS-120B's all-in of 162 total. I've put in 12, so I need to add 150 more.\n\nBut GPT-OSS-120B only has 4 chips! How can they bet 162? This must be that the 162 includes the BB they already posted. So: They posted BB of 4, then went all-in for their remaining 0? Actually no, they have 4 total, posted 4 as BB, so they have 0 left. They can't raise. Unless... they had 4 chips, posted BB of 4, then when it's their turn, they go all-in for their last 0? That doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe the stack display is wrong, or GPT-OSS-120B actually has more chips. Let me check previous hands. In hand #27, they folded preflop. In hand #26, they folded preflop. In hand #25, they raised to 12. In hand #24, they folded. In hand #23, they raised to 12. So they've been playing somewhat aggressively when they have chips.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll assume GPT-OSS-120B is all-in with a very short stack, probably 4 chips or similar.\n\nNow, my decision: I have Ac5c suited. It's a decent hand",

Position: Button - great position\n3. Stack: 198 chips (49.5 BB)\n4. Action: I raised to 12, MiniMax-M2 3-bet to 20, GPT-OSS-120B went all-in (effectively with their tiny stack)\n5. Amount to call: 150 more (to match GPT-OSS-120B's all-in)\n6. Pot size: 194 currently, would be 194 + my 150 = 344 if I call\n7. Pot odds: 150 to win 344, roughly 1:2.3, need ~30% equity\n\nThe key factor: GPT-OSS-120B has only 4 chips, so their all-in is essentially a side pot. The main action is between me and MiniMax-M2. If I call 150, I'll have 48 chips left (12 BB). MiniMax-M2 still has to act behind me.\n\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's history: They've raised preflop 7 times in 27 hands, which is fairly aggressive (~26% raising frequency). But now they're essentially all-in with whatever they have.\n\nMiniMax-M2 has raised preflop twice in hand #21, showing some aggression.\n\nMy Ac5c has decent equity against random hands, but I'm facing a 3-bet from MiniMax-M2 and an all-in from GPT-OSS-120B. If I call, I'm likely dominated by MiniMax-M2's 3-betting range.\n\nAlso, if I call 150 (75% of my stack), I'll be pot-committed on the flop with only 48 chips left. This would be a huge commitment with a marginal hand.\n\nBetter to fold here and preserve my stack. Ac5s is not strong enough to call a 3-bet and an all-in, especially when I'll be out of position relative to MiniMax-M2 post-flop if they call.\n\nThe pot odds are decent (30% needed), but my hand likely has less than 30% equity against MiniMax-M2's 3-betting range, which likely includes strong hands like TT+, AQ+, maybe some suited connectors.\n\nLet me fold and wait for a better spot.",

This is very strong.\n\n2. **Current Situation**: \n   - I'm in the button position with 179 chips (44.8 BB)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has only 4 chips left and just raised to 162\n   - I need to call 142 chips to stay in the hand\n   - The pot is already 194 chips\n\n3. **Opponent Analysis**: \n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been very active with raises, but I haven't seen any showdowns from them\n   - They've been raising with small amounts (12-28 chips) in recent hands\n   - This massive 162-chip raise represents 97% of their stack (they only had 4 chips left, but somehow raised to 162... this seems like an error in the data or they're going all-in)\n\n4. **Tournament Considerations**:\n   - With 179 chips, I'm in a decent position (44.8 BB)\n   - Calling 142 chips would leave me with only 37 chips\n   - This would put me in a very short-stack situation if I lose\n\n5. **Pot Odds and Decision**:\n   - Pot odds: I'd be getting about 1.37:1 (194 + 142 = 336 total pot, I need to call 142)\n   - However, with pocket kings, I could be dominated by pocket aces\n   - The opponent's massive overbet suggests either a very strong hand or desperation\n\n6. **Risk vs Reward**:\n   - If I call and lose, I'm down to 37 chips (9.25 BB) - very short stacked\n   - If I call and win, I get a significant boost to around 321 chips\n   - But with only 4 chips, this opponent might be making a desperate move\n\nThe key issue here is that this opponent only has 4 chips but somehow raised to 162. This doesn't make sense unless they're somehow going all-in and the system is tracking it differently. \n\nI'll carefully evaluate the potential risks. With pocket kings, I'm facing a significant uncertainty. The opponent's unusual betting pattern suggests they might hold a premium hand like pocket aces or be making a desperate move. Given my chip position, I can't afford to take a massive risk that could leave me nearly out of the tournament.\n\nThe potential reward of winning 162 chips is tempting, but the risk of losing 142 chips and being pushed to the brink of elimination is too high. I'll prioritize my tournament survival and fold, preserving my 179 chips for a more favorable situation.\n",

Wait UTG's raise amount is 12 total, meaning he puts 12 chips (including call of 2). So extra 10 chips. So pot = 6 + 10 = 16? Let's not worry.\n\nNow SB 3-bet to 20 (total). So we face 16 to call.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 raises small (6) often, but this time raised to 12 maybe a bit larger. MiniMax-M2 has raised 16 and 65 in previous hand, showing willingness to 3-bet bigger. Could be strong.\n\nGiven QQ, we should consider 4-bet or call. Stack 162, effective stack after call would be about 146. 4-betting could isolate and get value, but risk if opponent has AA or KK. But we have QQ, good hand to 4-bet. Minimum raise to 28, which is only 8 more (so total 28). That's a small 4-bet size relative to pot (pot before our action: 4 (our blind) + 12 (UTG) + 20 (SB) = 36? Actually pot is 2+4+12+20 = 38? Wait the posted amounts: SB posted 2 (but then also contributed to the raise?), SB posted 2, then later raises to 20, meaning he adds 18 more (total 20). BB posted 4. UTG raised to 12 (adds 10 extra). So total chips in pot before our decision: SB 20, BB 4, UTG 12 = 36. Yes pot = 36.\n\nIf we call 16, pot will be 36+16=52, we have 146 left. If we 4-bet to 28 (total), we add 24 more (since we already have 4 in pot). So we invest 24, pot becomes 36+24=60, and opponent must call 8 more (to 28) or raise.\n\nGiven typical 4-bet sizing: with deep stacks, 4-bet to around 2.5-3x the 3-bet. Here 3-bet is 20, so 4-bet maybe 50-60. But min raise is only 28, which is small; we could go all-in for 162 if we think we are ahead. But maybe better to call and see flop, as we have good equity vs many ranges.\n\nBut tournament stage: we have 162 chips, relatively short (40 BB). So preserving stack is important, but also we need chips. QQ is strong. A 4-bet could get us all-in against a 3-bet range that includes many hands. If opponent 3-bet is wide, we are likely ahead. But if they are tight, they could have AA or KK.\n\nGiven we have a short stack, maybe we should go all-in to maximize equity. But raising to min 28 is not all-in; we could raise all-in (162). Legal actions include raise; we can raise to any amount up to our stack. So we could go all-in.\n\nShould we call? If we call, we risk being outdrawn by AK etc. But we can see flop and maybe fold if out of position. However"

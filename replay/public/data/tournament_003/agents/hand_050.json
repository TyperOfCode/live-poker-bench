T4s is too weak to call a raise from a tight player, even with position and suited cards.",

But consider stack sizes: SB 4 chips (cannot act further), BB 8 chips (already posted). They may fold to raise? The raise is from CO; SB and BB already posted and are out of position. The SB is short and will be forced to either call 16 (can't, because only 4 chips) so they'd be all-in or fold. Actually they'd need to call 12 more to match 16, but they only have 4, so they'd go all-in for 4 (i.e., they'd be all-in for 4). But they could also fold. The BB has 8 chips, need call 8 more (total 16). So they'd be all-in for 8 if they call. So the raise could be a steal attempt.\n\nGiven our hand is weak, we should fold.

It's not strong enough to play against a raise typically.\n\n2. **Position**: SB (small blind) - Worst position post-flop, I'd be first to act on all streets.\n\n3. **Stack**: 178 chips (11.1 BB) - I'm relatively short-stacked. This is actually a decent stack for tournament play but not super deep.\n\n4. **Pot**: 56 chips\n   - SB: 8\n   - BB: 16\n   - Raise: 32 (2x the big blind)\n   - I need to call 24 to see the flop\n\n5. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 with 108 chips (6.75 BB)\n   - Looking at their history, they fold a LOT (about 75% of hands)\n   - They do raise occasionally with varying amounts (20, 24, 30)\n   - In hand 66, they checked then made a big bet on the turn (116 chips when they had 116)\n   - They've been relatively tight/passive overall\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 24 to win 56, which is about 2.3:1 or ~30% equity needed.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I'm in decent shape with 11.1 BB\n   - The opponent is shorter at 6.75 BB\n   - Folding keeps me in good position relative to the blinds\n\n8. **Hand strength**: Q9o is marginal. It doesn't play well against a raising range. Even though the opponent seems tight, when they do raise, they likely have decent hands.\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm out of position\n- My hand is marginal at best\n- I have a decent stack that I shouldn't jeopardize with marginal hands\n- The opponent, despite being tight, is showing aggression here\n- The raise is 2x BB which could mean a real hand\n\nI should fold. Q9o from SB against a raise is a clear fold in most situations, especially with my stack size being healthy enough to wait for better spots.",

However, looking at recent hands (60-67), they've folded 6 times, checked once, and only in hand 66 did they bet on the turn. Their most recent raise was hand 58 (30 chips). They seem to be playing somewhat tight recently.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 56 chips (16 BB + 8 SB + 32 raise)\n- To call: 16 chips\n- Pot odds: 16 to win 72 (56+16) = 22.2% equity needed\n- My hand J8o vs a typical raising range has maybe 30-35% equity\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\n- Opponent has only 108 chips total, so if I call and they shove on flop, I'm committed\n- My stack is 418 vs their 108, so I have them covered\n\n**Tournament Context:**\n- I have a healthy 26 BB stack\n- Opponent is short with 6.75 BB\n- J8o is a weak hand, especially out of position\n- The raise is min-raise (2x) which could indicate strength or just standard from short stack\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Hand strength: J8o is weak, doesn't play well postflop\n2. Position: I'm out of position\n3. Opponent stack: Short stack might be shoving any flop\n4. Pot odds: 22% equity needed, J8o might have ~30% vs wide range\n5. Tournament: I have chips to spare, but don't want to bleed unnecessarily\n\nGiven opponent is short-stacked and has shown some aggression preflop historically, they could be raising with a wide range. However, J8o is really weak and I'm out of position. The pot odds are decent but not great.\n\nBetter to fold here and wait for better spots. I have a healthy stack and don't need to gamble with J8o out of position against a short stack who might be shoving any flop.\n\nLet me fold."

Let me analyze:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My hand: Js 8h (off-suit, mediocre hand)\n- Position: BB (out of position for the rest of the hand)\n- Stack: 418 chips (26.1 BB) - healthy stack\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 with 108 chips (6.75 BB) - short stack\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data, GPT-OSS-120B has raised preflop 13 times in 67 hands, which is about 19% of hands. However, looking at recent hands (60-67), they've folded 6 times, checked once, and only in hand 66 did they bet on the turn. Their most recent raise was hand 58 (30 chips). They seem to be playing somewhat tight recently.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 56 chips (16 BB + 8 SB + 32 raise)\n- To call: 16 chips\n- Pot odds: 16 to win 72 (56+16) = 22.2% equity needed\n- My hand J8o vs a typical raising range has maybe 30-35% equity\n\n**Stack Considerations:**\n- Opponent has only 108 chips total, so if I call and they shove on flop, I'm committed\n- My stack is 418 vs their 108, so I have them covered\n\n**Tournament Context:**\n- I have a healthy 26 BB stack\n- Opponent is short with 6.75 BB\n- J8o is a weak hand, especially out of position\n- The raise is min-raise (2x) which could indicate strength or just standard from short stack\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. Hand strength: J8o is weak, doesn't play well postflop\n2. Position: I'm out of position\n3. Opponent stack: Short stack might be shoving any flop\n4. Pot odds: 22% equity needed, J8o might have ~30% vs wide range\n5. Tournament: I have chips to spare, but don't want to bleed unnecessarily\n\nGiven opponent is short-stacked and has shown some aggression preflop historically, they could be raising with a wide range. However, J8o is really weak and I'm out of position. The pot odds are decent but not great.\n\nBetter to fold here and wait for better spots. I have a healthy stack and don't need to gamble with J8o out of position against a short stack who might be shoving any flop.\n\nLet me fold.",

            "reasoning_content": "We have hand 8d Jh, position BTN, stack 140 chips (~8.8 BB). Blinds 8/16, pot 24 (SB+BB). Opponents: Seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) with 178 chips, seat3 DeepSeek-V3.2 with 418 chips, seat4 folded. So we face a raise from BB? Actually actions: seat1 posted sb 8, seat3 posted bb 16, seat4 fold. So we are after the BB (deepseek) posted 16, now it's our turn. No raises yet, just blinds posted. Amount to call 16 (the BB). Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise by 16 more). Legal: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have 8h Jd, off-suit, not great. In BTN with 8.8 BB stack, we could consider a steal. However, we have relatively short stack; we could try to steal blind. Opponent in BB is DeepSeek-V3.2 with 418 chips (large stack). Likely they will defend with a wide range? Might be a decent defender. Also seat1 (SB) has 178 chips, but they already posted sb and are not acting now.\n\nWe could call 16 (total 32 in pot). If we call, we will be out of position post-flop with a marginal hand. Raise could be good to try to steal. Minimum raise to 32 means total 32 (i.e., raise by 16). That would be 32 total, i.e., we put 32 chips, making pot 56 (SB 8 + BB 16 + our raise 32). Actually raise to 32 total, so we add 16 more beyond call, so total bet 32 from us. That is 2 BB raise (size 2x BB). That's a standard steal size. With 8.8 BB, we can raise.\n\nGiven our hand is not premium, but still decent for a steal? J8 offsuit is not great for a raise from BTN with short stack. Might be okay as a steal but risk if called and we are out of position.\n\nConsider tournament stage: stack 140, 8.8 BB, short. Might want to try to double up by stealing blinds. But risk losing 16 chips if called and we get stuck. However, we can also just call and see flop.\n\nI think raising is appropriate to attempt steal. Opponent BB may defend with a wide range but also could have strong hands. If they call, we are in a tough spot.\n\nGiven we have only 8.8 BB, we could also go all-in (140) but that's too much. Minimum raise is 32, we can raise to 32.\n\nThus action: raise to 32.\n\nReasoning: short stack, position, attempt to steal blinds, hand not great but decent enough for a steal; raise size minimal.\n\nLet's output JSON.",

This suggests a strong range.\n\n4. **Stack size**: I have 200 chips (100 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to take risks with marginal hands.\n\n5. **Action**: There's a raise to 4 chips (2x BB). I need to call 4 chips to see a flop.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 7 chips, and I need to call 4 chips, giving me pot odds of 7:4 or 1.75:1. This is not good enough for a hand this weak.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: Early in a tournament with a full stack, I should be selective with my hands. T3o is definitely a fold.\n\nThe opponent has no history in my database, so I can't use that information, but the position and action alone suggest strength.\n\nI should fold this hand.

If I hit a K on the flop, I'll often be out-kicked. The flush potential is nice but not enough to justify playing this from early position.\n\n2. **Position disadvantage**: Being UTG means I'll have 4-5 players acting after me. Many hands dominate K6s (any better Kx, any pocket pair, any two Broadway cards).\n\n3. **Tournament considerations**: It's early in the tournament (Hand #2). No need to take marginal spots. Better to preserve chips for better opportunities.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: 2 chips to win 3 chips (1.5:1) - not compelling enough to call with a marginal hand.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold.

This is not a premium hand. J-7 offsuit is in the bottom 20% of starting hands.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (Under the Gun), which is the worst position preflop. I have 5 opponents yet to act behind me. In early position, I need to play very tight.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 200 chips (100 BB), which is a healthy stack. No immediate pressure.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: It's early in the tournament (hand #3). I should be playing relatively tight and preserving my stack.\n\n5. **Standard play**: From UTG, the standard opening range is very tight - typically only premium hands like high pairs (JJ+, QQ, KK, AA), AK, AQ, and sometimes AJ suited. J-7 offsuit is nowhere near this range.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 to win 3, which is 1.5:1. While the pot odds are decent, this is irrelevant with such a weak hand from early position.\n\n7. **Future considerations**: If I call, I could face raises from multiple opponents behind me. Even if I see the flop, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nThe clear correct play here is to fold.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Information:**\n- My hand: 6h Kd (King-6 offsuit)\n- Position: BTN (Button) - best position\n- Stack: 200 chips (100 BB)\n- Blinds: 1/2\n- Pot: 3 chips\n- To call: 1 chip\n- Minimum raise: 4 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- Only opponent left is BB (Seat 2: Kimi-K2) with 191 chips\n- From opponent history:\n  - Hand 1: Preflop fold\n  - Hand 2: Preflop raise to 6, then fold\n  - Hand 3: Preflop fold\n  - Hand 4: Preflop fold\n\nKimi-K2 seems to be playing relatively tight, folding most hands preflop. They did raise once (Hand 2) but then folded, suggesting they might be cautious or only raising with strong hands.\n\n**Hand Strength Analysis:**\n- K6 offsuit is a marginal hand\n- King is decent but kicker is very weak (6)\n- Not suited, so no flush potential\n- Some straight potential but very weak\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n- On the Button, I'm in the best position post-flop\n- Everyone folded to me, so it's just me vs the BB\n- I have position advantage throughout the hand\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Marginal at best\n2. **Position**: Excellent (on the button)\n3. **Opponent**: Seems tight, likely to fold to pressure\n4. **Pot odds**: Need to call 1 to win 3 (3:1 odds)\n5. **Stack sizes**: Deep stacked (100 BB effective)\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Too tight from the button with only BB left\n2. **Call (1 chip)**: Cheap to see flop in position. Good pot odds (3:1). If I hit a King, I can likely get value. If I miss, I can easily fold.\n3. **Raise**: Could steal from tight opponent. Min raise is 4 chips. Could make it 5-6 chips total.\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm on the button\n- It's only 1 chip to call (0.5% of my stack)\n- Pot odds are good (3:1)\n- I have position throughout\n- Opponent seems tight and may fold to aggression\n- K6o has some playability, especially if I hit a King\n\nI think the best play is to **call**. Raising could work as a steal, but K6o is too weak to raise for value, and I don't need to steal from the BB when I have position. Calling is cheap and allows me to see the flop with good odds.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Since the opponent has folded 3 out of 4 times preflop, they might be tight enough that a raise could steal the blinds. However, the min raise is 4 chips, and if called, I'd be out of position with a marginal hand. \n\nThe conservative but correct play is to **call** and see a cheap flop in position.",

No value in betting with this weak hand.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n**My hand**: 6h Kd - King-high with a 6 kicker. This is not a strong hand.\n\n**Board**: 8d 2s 5s - There's a possible straight draw (3-4-6-7) but I don't have that. I have a gutshot straight draw if a 4 comes (4-5-6-7-8). There's also a flush draw with three spades on board.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button, which is good position.\n\n**Pot**: 4 chips\n\n**Action**: It's checked to me. I can check or raise.\n\n**Opponent**: Seat 2 is the BB. Looking at their history:\n- Hand 1: preflop fold\n- Hand 2: preflop raise to 6, then fold (so they raised but got called and folded)\n- Hand 3: preflop fold\n- Hand 4: preflop fold\n\nSo Seat 2 has been quite tight, folding 3 out of 4 hands preflop. In Hand 2 they raised but then folded, suggesting they can make continuation bets but will fold to resistance.\n\n**My hand analysis**: \n- I have King-high, which might be good if my opponent has nothing\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 4)\n- The board has 3 spades, so a flush draw is possible (but I don't have a spade)\n- My hand is weak overall\n\n**Decision**: I think checking is the best option here. My hand is weak, I only have a gutshot draw and King-high. The opponent is tight and checked to me. There's no value in betting here - I can't get called by worse hands often enough. If I bet and get called, I'm likely behind. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to see a free turn card that might improve my hand (a King would give me top pair, a 4 would give me a straight).\n\nI could consider a small bluff bet since I have position and the opponent is tight, but it's not necessary with this weak hand. Let me just check and see the turn.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. \n\nI have a gutshot straight draw and King-high. The opponent checked to me. A small bet could be a good play here for a few reasons:\n1. I have position\n2. Opponent is tight and likely missed this board\n3. I can represent a strong hand\n4. I have some equity with the gutshot\n\nBut checking is also fine - it keeps the pot small and lets me realize my equity for free.\n\nActually, I think checking is better. My hand is too weak to value bet, and while I could bluff, there's no need to risk chips here. Let me check and see the turn.\n\nActually wait - let me think about this more carefully. The pot is 4 chips. If I bet 2 chips (minimum raise to 2, but that means total bet of 2), I could potentially win the pot right now. The opponent is tight and has shown they can fold. The board is somewhat scary with 3 spades.\n\nBut I don't have a spade, so if a spade comes on the turn, I'll be in a tough spot.\n\nI think the best play is to check. My hand is weak, I have some equity with the gutshot, and I can see a free card. No need to build a pot with King-high.\n\nLet me check.",

This suggests they likely have a weak hand.\n\n**My hand:** K-high is actually decent in a heads-up pot where both players have shown weakness. I have 6 outs to a pair (3 Kings, 3 sixes), though some might not be clean outs if opponent has a better kicker.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the button, which is advantageous.\n\n**Pot odds:** If I bet 2 (minimum raise), I'm risking 2 to win 4, so I need 33% equity. If opponent folds even 50% of the time, this is profitable.\n\nGiven that:\n1. Opponent has shown weakness (checked twice)\n2. I have position\n3. I have some equity with K-high\n4. A small bet could take down the pot\n5. Opponent is tight based on history\n\nI should make a small value bet/probe bet to try to take down the pot now. This is a good spot to represent strength and capitalize on opponent's passivity.\n\nMinimum raise is to 2 chips total.

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent in Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been mostly folding preflop in the previous hands. In Hand #2 they raised preflop but then folded when facing action. They seem to be playing fairly tight and straightforward.\n\nNow on the turn:\n- I have Kd6h - a weak hand with just king-high\n- Board: 8d 2s 5s Jh - there's a flush draw on board (spades) and a straight draw possibility\n- I bet 2 on the turn and got raised to 8 (a min-raise of 6 more to call)\n- Pot is now 14 + my 2 + their 8 = 24 chips\n- I need to call 6 to see the river\n\nLet me think about this:\n1. My hand strength: I have K-high with no pair, no draw. My king might be good if opponent has nothing, but the raise suggests they have something.\n2. Position: I'm on the button which is good position.\n3. Opponent: Based on their history, they're not super aggressive. They raise with real hands.\n4. Pot odds: I need to call 6 to win 24, so 4:1 odds. That's decent, but I have no real equity.\n5. The board has draws that could have hit or could complete on river.\n\nThe opponent check-called preflop (they checked as BB and I just called as SB), then checked the flop. Now on the turn they raise after I bet. This is a strong move from a normally tight player. They could have:\n- A made hand: any pair (Jx, 8x, 5x, 2x), two pair, set\n- A draw: spade flush draw, straight draw (6-7, 7-9, etc.)\n\nWith my K-high, I'm likely behind. Even if they have a flush draw, I don't have a spade to block it. The raise size is small (min-raise), which might sometimes be a draw, but from a tight player it's more likely a made hand.\n\nI should probably fold here. I have no equity, no draw, and I'm facing aggression from a tight player. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify a call with just king-high.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The pot is 14, I bet 2, they raised to 8. So the pot is actually: initial 14 + my 2 + their 8 = 24. I need to call 6 more. So pot odds are 24:6 or 4:1.\n\nBut I have NO outs. Even if I hit a king, it might not be good. And if they have a flush draw, they have 9 outs. If they have a pair, I have 6 outs (3 kings, 3 sixes). But many of those outs might not be clean.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature and the fact that they're raising on the turn after showing weakness earlier, I think this is a fold.",

It's offsuit, disconnected, and low. This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is great position, but even position can't make up for such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3, so 2:3 odds or 40% equity needed. I definitely don't have this with 48o.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: \n   - SB has shown willingness to raise preflop\n   - BB has made larger preflop raises and seems to play a somewhat wide range (showed JQ)\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: \n   - I have a healthy stack (98.5 BB)\n   - No need to get involved with marginal hands\n   - Preserve chips for better spots\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. 48 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. Even with good position and relatively cheap entry (only 2 chips), it's not worth playing. I should wait for a better spot.\n\nThe only scenario where I might consider playing this is if both opponents were extremely tight and I could steal the blinds frequently, but based on the action I've seen (they've both raised preflop before), I don't have that read yet.",

This keeps the pot small and allows me to use my positional advantage postflop.\n\nHowever, I could also consider a **raise** to 15-18 chips to:\n1. Isolate the raiser\n2. Take control of the hand\n3. Potentially win preflop if they're weak\n\nBut given the opponent's tight raising pattern, a call seems safer. Let me go with the call to see the flop in position.",

Let's analyze:\n\n**Hand details:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: Js Ks (King-Jack suited, spades)\n- Stack: 191 chips (95.5 BB)\n- Board: Qs 9s 8h (Queen, nine, eight with two spades)\n- Pot: 19 chips\n- Opponent: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) with 194 chips\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Flop: Qs 9s 8h\n- Opponent bet: 4 chips (small bet into 19 chip pot)\n- Amount to call: 4 chips\n- We have a very strong draw: King-high flush draw + gutshot straight draw\n\n**Hand strength analysis:**\n- We have Ks Js - two spades on a board with two spades (Qs 9s)\n- This gives us a King-high flush draw (nut flush draw if we hit the spade, since Ace of spades would beat us)\n- We also have a gutshot straight draw: 10 would give us a straight (K-Q-J-10-9)\n- So we have 9 spade outs for the flush + 4 ten outs for the straight = 13 outs total\n- However, note that the Ts is both a spade AND completes our straight, so we need to be careful not to double count\n- Actually: Spade outs: As, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, Ts, Js, Ks (but we have Js Ks) = 9 spades total, we have 2, so 7 remaining spades\n- Straight outs: Ts (any suit) = 4 tens total\n- But Ts is already counted in spade outs, so total outs = 7 spades + 3 non-spade tens = 10 outs\n- Wait, let me recount: Board is Qs 9s 8h\n- Our cards: Ks Js\n- Flush outs: Any spade except Qs, 9s, Js, Ks = As, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, Ts, 8s = 9 spade outs\n- Straight outs: Any ten gives us K-Q-J-10-9 straight = Ts, Tc, Td, Th = 4 ten outs\n- But Ts is already counted in spade outs, so total unique outs = 9 + 3 = 12 outs\n- Actually, let me be more precise: \n  - Flush draw: 9 spades in the deck, 2 on board, 2 in our hand = 5 spades accounted for, so 8 spades remaining (13 total - 5 accounted for = 8)\n  - Straight draw: We need a ten. There are 4 tens in the deck.\n  - Total outs = 8 spades + 4 tens = 12 outs, but the Ts is counted twice, so 11 unique outs\n- Wait, let's do this properly:\n  - Total cards: 52\n  - Known cards: 2 in our hand + 3 on board = 5 cards\n  - Unknown cards: 47\n  - Spades: 13 total. We know Qs, 9s, Ks, Js = 4 spades accounted for. So 9 spades remaining.\n  - Tens: 4 total. None on board or in our hand. So 4 tens remaining.\n  - Ts is in both categories, so total outs = 9 + 4 - 1 = 12 outs\n- Actually, the Ts is just one card that serves both purposes. So we have 9 spade outs + 4 ten outs = 13 total, but one overlaps (Ts), so 12 unique outs\n- Let me verify: Cards that help us:\n  - As, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s, Ts (9 spades) = 9 cards\n  - Tc, Td, Th (3 non-spade tens) = 3 cards\n  - Total = 12 outs\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 19 chips\n- Bet to call: 4 chips\n- Pot odds: 19:4 or 4.75:1\n- We need equity of: 4/(19+4) = 4/23 = 17.4% to break even\n- With 12 outs on the flop, we have approximately 12*2 = 24% equity (rule of 2)\n- Actually, with 12 outs and 2 cards to come, equity is about"

Let's analyze:\n\n**Hand details:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: Js Ks (King-Jack suited, spades)\n- Stack: 191 chips (95.5 BB)\n- Board: Qs 9s 8h (Queen, nine, eight with two spades)\n- Pot: 19 chips\n- Opponent: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) with 194 chips\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Flop: Qs 9s 8h\n- Opponent bet: 4 chips (small bet into 19 chip pot)\n- Amount to call: 4 chips\n- We have a very strong draw: King-high flush draw + gutshot straight draw\n\n**Hand strength analysis:**\n- We have Ks Js - two spades on a board with two spades (Qs 9s)\n- This gives us a King-high flush draw (nut flush draw if we hit the spade, since Ace of spades would beat us)\n- We also have a gutshot straight draw: 10 would give us a straight (K-Q-J-10-9)\n- So we have 9 spade outs for the flush + 4 ten outs for the straight = 13 outs total\n- However, note that the Ts is both a spade AND completes our straight, so we need to be careful not to double count\n- Actually: Spade outs: As, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, Ts, Js, Ks (but we have Js Ks) = 9 spades total, we have 2, so 7 remaining spades\n- Straight outs: Ts (any suit) = 4 tens total\n- But Ts is already counted in spade outs, so total outs = 7 spades + 3 non-spade tens = 10 outs\n- Wait, let me recount: Board is Qs 9s 8h\n- Our cards: Ks Js\n- Flush outs: Any spade except Qs, 9s, Js, Ks = As, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, Ts, 8s = 9 spade outs\n- Straight outs: Any ten gives us K-Q-J-10-9 straight = Ts, Tc, Td, Th = 4 ten outs\n- But Ts is already counted in spade outs, so total unique outs = 9 + 3 = 12 outs\n- Actually, let me be more precise: \n  - Flush draw: 9 spades in the deck, 2 on board, 2 in our hand = 5 spades accounted for, so 8 spades remaining (13 total - 5 accounted for = 8)\n  - Straight draw: We need a ten. There are 4 tens in the deck.\n  - Total outs = 8 spades + 4 tens = 12 outs, but the Ts is counted twice, so 11 unique outs\n- Wait, let's do this properly:\n  - Total cards: 52\n  - Known cards: 2 in our hand + 3 on board = 5 cards\n  - Unknown cards: 47\n  - Spades: 13 total. We know Qs, 9s, Ks, Js = 4 spades accounted for. So 9 spades remaining.\n  - Tens: 4 total. None on board or in our hand. So 4 tens remaining.\n  - Ts is in both categories, so total outs = 9 + 4 - 1 = 12 outs\n- Actually, the Ts is just one card that serves both purposes. So we have 9 spade outs + 4 ten outs = 13 total, but one overlaps (Ts), so 12 unique outs\n- Let me verify: Cards that help us:\n  - As, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, 8s, Ts (9 spades) = 9 cards\n  - Tc, Td, Th (3 non-spade tens) = 3 cards\n  - Total = 12 outs\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 19 chips\n- Bet to call: 4 chips\n- Pot odds: 19:4 or 4.75:1\n- We need equity of: 4/(19+4) = 4/23 = 17.4% to break even\n- With 12 outs on the flop, we have approximately 12*2 = 24% equity (rule of 2)\n- Actually, with 12 outs and 2 cards to come, equity is about",

          "reasoning_content": "  The search results show me GPT-OSS-120B's playing patterns across 6 hands. Let me analyze:\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B's tendencies:**\n- Hand 1: Raised preflop, bet flop (2 into 9), bet turn (8) - took aggressive line\n- Hand 2: Folded preflop\n- Hand 3: Folded preflop when facing raise and call\n- Hand 4: Folded preflop\n- Hand 5: Folded preflop\n- Hand 6: Folded preflop\n\nSo GPT-OSS-120B has been quite tight, folding preflop 5 out of 6 times. When they did enter the pot (Hand 1), they played aggressively postflop.\n\nIn the current hand (Hand 7), they raised preflop to 6, and now bet 4 on the flop into a 19 chip pot. This is a small bet (21% pot).\n\n**My hand:** Js Ks - I have a strong combo draw:\n- Flush draw (King-high)\n- Gutshot straight draw (need a Ten)\n- Backdoor straight possibilities\n\n**Pot odds:** 4 to call into 23 total = 17.4% needed equity\n**My equity:** ~12 outs = ~24% on the turn, ~48% by river\n\nEven against a strong hand like top pair, I have good equity. The opponent's small bet suggests either:\n1. Weak hand trying to see where they stand\n2. Strong hand trying to extract value\n3. Drawing hand themselves\n\nGiven their tight preflop play but aggressive postflop in Hand 1, I should raise here to:\n1. Build the pot when I have strong equity\n2. Charge them for drawing\n3. Potentially take it down now\n4. Gain initiative\n\nI should raise to about 14-16 chips (roughly 3-4x their bet). Let's make it 15 total.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Current Hand Situation:**\n- My position: BTN (Button)\n- My cards: Js Ks (King-Jack suited, spades)\n- My stack: 176 chips (88 BB)\n- Board: Qs 9s 8h 2d\n- Pot: 45 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have a flush draw (spades) with Ks Js\n- I have an open-ended straight draw (any Ten gives me a straight)\n- I have two overcards (K and J)\n- This gives me a very strong drawing hand with many outs\n\n**Outs calculation:**\n- Flush draw: 9 spades remaining (13 total - 4 on board/in hand)\n- Straight draw: 4 Tens (but Ts is already counted in flush draw, so 3 additional)\n- Overcards: 3 Kings + 3 Jacks = 6 outs (but some may be blocked by flush/straight cards)\n- Total clean outs: ~15 outs (9 flush + 3 straight + some overcard outs)\n\nThis is approximately a 30-32% chance to hit on the river.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 45 chips\n- To call: 0 (opponent checked)\n- If I bet, minimum raise is to 11\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n- Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n  - Hand 1: Raised preflop, bet flop and turn, folded to turn bet\n  - Hand 2: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 3: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 4: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 5: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 6: Folded preflop\n\nGPT-OSS-120B seems to be playing tight but also betting when they have initiative. They raised preflop to 6, bet 4 on flop, called my raise to 15, and now checked on turn.\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Preflop: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 6, I called\n- Flop: GPT-OSS-120B bet 4, I raised to 15, they called\n- Turn: They checked\n\nThe check on turn after calling my flop raise suggests they might be:\n1. Weak and giving up\n2. Pot-controlling with a marginal hand\n3. Setting a trap with a strong hand\n\nGiven the board texture Qs 9s 8h 2d, possible hands they could have:\n- Made hands: Qx, 9x, 8x, 22, 99, QQ\n- Draws: Spade flush draws, straight draws (JT, T7, 76)\n- Air: Various hands that missed\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check: See a free river card with my strong draw\n2. Bet: Build the pot when I hit, fold out some better hands, charge draws\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 88 BB\n- Pot is already 45 chips\n- Building the pot now could win me a big pot if I hit\n\n**Decision:**\nWith such a strong draw (flush + straight + overcards), I should bet for value and to build the pot. Checking would give a free card but I'd miss value when I hit. \n\nSince opponent checked, I can make a value bet with my draw. A bet of around 20-25 chips (half pot) would be appropriate to:\n- Charge draws\n- Build pot for when I hit\n- Potentially fold out marginal hands\n\nMinimum raise is 11, but I should bet more than that. Let me bet 22 chips (roughly half pot).",

History shows they call preflop sometimes and make small bets on flop/river. They folded many preflop hands. They seem somewhat passive.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Just bet 4 chips. History shows they were very tight (folded first 3 hands), then in hand 7 they raised preflop, bet flop, called a raise, then folded on turn. They seem capable of bluffing or betting with marginal hands, but also folding when faced with resistance.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 10, I need to call 4\n- Getting 2.5:1 odds\n- I need 28.6% equity to call\n\n**Equity analysis:**\nWith 3-high on a 2-4-9 board, I likely have very low equity. Even against a pure bluff, my 3-high might not be good. I'm probably drawing to runner-runner straight or two pair/trips, which is very unlikely.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. I have no hand, no draw, and while the pot odds aren't terrible, I have almost no chance of winning this hand. My stack is healthy at 109.5 BB, so there's no need to chase with such a weak hand. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nEven if both opponents are bluffing, my 3-high is very unlikely to be the best hand. The bet from Seat 5 suggests some strength, and I have no information about Seat 4's intentions yet.",

It's not premium but playable in position.\n2. **Position**: Button is the best position - I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: I don't have any specific reads yet, but I should raise to isolate the BB.\n4. **Pot odds**: Very good - only 1 to call to win 3.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should be looking to accumulate chips.\n\n**Decision**: I should raise to isolate the big blind and take control of the hand. A standard raise would be 3x-4x the BB, so 6-8 chips. The minimum is 4, but that's too small. I'll raise to 6 or 7 to make it a proper raise.\n\nLet me make a standard button raise:\n- Raise to 6 or 7 chips (3x-3.5x BB)\n- This pressures the BB and gives me initiative\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips.",

While they may fold to a steal attempt, risking 2 chips with this trash hand isn't worth it, especially with a healthy 110 BB stack. Fold and wait for a better spot.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the hand:\n- I'm on the BTN with 6s 4d - this is a very weak hand (64 offsuit)\n- My stack is 221 chips (110.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Two opponents: Kimi-K2 (SB) and DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB)\n- Pot is 3 chips (1+2 blinds)\n- Both opponents have folded many hands recently\n\nLet me analyze opponent tendencies:\n- **Kimi-K2 (SB)**: Very tight! Folded preflop in 7 of last 10 hands. Only raised once (hand 6) and made one turn raise (hand 5). Seems to play very few hands.\n- **DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB)**: Also very tight! Folded preflop in 6 of last 10 hands. Only played hand 3 where they called down with JQ suited on an A-high board.\n\nGiven this information:\n1. **Hand strength**: 6s 4d is trash. Very low suitedness, low connectivity, low card ranks. This is a fold 99% of the time.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN which is great, but not enough to justify playing this hand.\n3. **Opponents**: Both opponents are extremely tight based on recent history. This means:\n   - If I raise, they're likely to fold often (good for stealing)\n   - But if they call/raise, they're likely to have strong hands\n4. **Stack size**: I have a healthy stack, no need to take risks with trash hands\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3 (1.5:1) which is not enough for this hand\n\nThe only argument for playing this hand would be as a steal attempt given how tight both opponents are. However:\n- I have 110 BB, no need to steal with trash\n- If either opponent defends, I'll be out of position postflop with a terrible hand\n- The risk/reward isn't worth it with this hand strength\n\n\nThe situation calls for a conservative approach. Folding is the most prudent action, protecting my stack and avoiding unnecessary risk with a weak hand against tight opponents.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the situation:\n\n**My hand**: Kd 5c (King of diamonds, 5 of clubs)\n**Position**: UTG (Under the Gun - first to act)\n**Stack**: 221 chips (110.5 BB)\n**Blinds**: 1/2\n**Pot**: 3 chips\n**To call**: 2 chips\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: K5o (King-Five offsuit) is a very weak hand, especially from early position. It's dominated by any other King with a better kicker, and the 5 doesn't help much.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG, the worst position preflop. I have 7 players left to act behind me, increasing the chance someone has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB): Very tight, folded 7 hands in a row preflop. Only played hand #3 with Jd Qd. This suggests they only play premium hands.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB): Also relatively tight, but has defended BB a couple times. Called in hand #8 and #9, but folded to aggression.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack of 110.5 BB. No need to take marginal spots from early position.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3 (1.5:1), which is not relevant here since my hand is too weak.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. K5o from UTG is a trash hand. I could be dominated by any Kx hand, and I'm out of position against 7 opponents. Even if I hit a King on the flop, I'll be in tough spots with such a weak kicker. The best play is to fold and wait for a better spot, especially given my healthy stack size.\n\nI don't need to search for more information - this is a straightforward fold based on basic poker fundamentals.",

When they do call, they often bet on flop (seen in hand 8). Seems like a tight-passive player.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Also mostly folding preflop (folded 6/9 times), but when they enter pots, they can be aggressive (bet 4 on flop in hand 9). The raise from SB suggests strength.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- J2o is a very weak hand, even with a diamond (not suited)\n- I'm out of position as BB\n- Facing a raise from SB who has been relatively tight\n- Pot odds: 6 to win 18 (12+6) = 3:1 or 25% equity needed\n- J2o has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. J2o is one of the worst hands in poker, I'm out of position, facing aggression from a player who appears tight, and I have no implied odds. Even with good pot odds, my hand is just too weak to continue.\n\nI should fold.",

King-high but very weak kicker.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB (small blind), which is out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\n3. **Stack**: 221 chips (110.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n4. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6 from late position (seat 5 with 5 players). The pot is 9 chips, I need to call 5 more.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n   - Hand 14: Raised preflop (amount 8)\n   - Hands 13, 12, 11, 10: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 9: Called preflop, then bet on flop\n   - Hand 8: Checked preflop, folded on flop\n   - Hand 7: Folded on turn\n\n   So they raise occasionally (hand 14 and now hand 15), but fold a lot. Their raise in hand 14 was for 8 chips, now they're raising to 6. This seems like a standard opening raise from late position.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 5 to win 9, so about 1.8:1 pot odds, which is roughly 36% equity needed.\n\n7. **Hand equity**: K4o has about 40-45% equity against a random hand, but against a raising range from late position, it's likely much worse - probably around 30-35% equity against a typical raising range.\n\n8. **Position disadvantage**: I'll be out of position post-flop, which makes it harder to realize my equity.\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots like this. The opponent seems to be raising with some frequency but also folding a lot. \n\nThe raise to 6 suggests they have a real hand. Given my weak K4o, out of position, and the fact that I need to hit something specific (like a king with a good kicker, or trips) to continue, this is an easy fold.\n\nLet me fold here.",

Has folded 9 out of 10 recent hands preflop. Only reached showdown once with JdQd.\n\n2. **My situation:**\n   - Position: BTN (best position)\n   - Hand: 9d Qh (Q9 offsuit) - marginal hand\n   - Stack: 221 chips (110.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - To call: 2 chips (1 BB)\n\n3. **Tournament considerations:**\n   - I have a healthy stack, no need to take unnecessary risks\n   - Both opponents are extremely tight, suggesting they're waiting for premium hands\n   - I'm on the button, which gives me position advantage\n\n4. **Hand analysis:**\n   - Q9 offsuit is not a strong hand, but it's playable from the button against tight players\n   - Against two very tight opponents who fold frequently, this is a good spot to steal the blinds\n   - The tight players are likely to fold unless they have premium holdings\n\nGiven that both opponents fold very frequently (especially DeepSeek-V3.2 who has folded 90% of recent hands), and I'm on the button with position advantage, this is a perfect spot for a steal attempt. A standard raise of 3x the big blind (6 chips) should be sufficient to take down the pot most of the time.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider the raise sizing. The minimum raise is to 4 chips (2x BB), but a 3x BB raise (6 chips) is more standard for a steal attempt and gives better fold equity.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: blinds are 1/2, so pot is 3 chips. A raise to 6 chips (3x BB) is standard. Let me raise to 6 chips total.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- My cards: 9d Qh - I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 10 to make a straight)\n- Stack: 215 chips (107.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Board: 5s Kc Js - There's a King and Jack on board\n- Pot: 18 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have Q9 with a board showing K-J-5. This gives me:\n- No pair\n- Gutshot straight draw (need a Ten to make a straight from 9-10-J-Q-K)\n- Backdoor flush draw (two diamonds, but board has one spade and two clubs)\n\n**Opponent Actions:**\n- Preflop: I raised to 6, both opponents called\n- Flop: Both opponents checked to me\n\nThis is a good situation for a continuation bet (c-bet). Let me think about what my opponents might have:\n\n**Opponent Ranges:**\nGiven they called preflop from SB and BB:\n- SB (Seat 2): Could have broadway cards, suited connectors, pocket pairs, etc.\n- BB (Seat 3): Could have a wide range since they got good odds to call\n\nThe K-J board hits a lot of calling ranges. However, the fact that both checked to me suggests weakness. They could have:\n- Hands that missed completely\n- Weak pairs (like 5x, maybe Jx)\n- Draws\n- Strong hands slowplaying (less likely with two players)\n\n**My Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card, see if I hit my gutshot. But this gives up initiative and allows opponents to realize equity for free.\n2. **Raise (c-bet)**: Apply pressure, take down the pot now, or build pot if I hit my draw.\n \nWith a gutshot draw and two opponents, checking seems like the most prudent move. The limited outs (only 4 Tens) and potential for opponents to have strong hands make a continuation bet risky. Checking allows me to see the next card without investing more chips, preserving my stack and avoiding unnecessary confrontation.\n\nI'll carefully consider the potential risks of betting against two opponents on this board texture. The presence of high cards like King and Jack means opponents could easily have connected hands. Checking provides a strategic way to control the pot size and manage my chip stack effectively.\n\nMy position on the button gives me flexibility, and the free card option looks most attractive with my current drawing hand. I'll take the conservative approach and check, maintaining my strategic options for future streets.",

I don't have the pot odds to chase this gutshot, and I'm against a tight player who is showing strength. \n\nThe pot odds are 2.3:1, but my draw needs roughly 10:1 to be profitable. My stack of 215 chips is deep enough to wait for better spots. The opponent's tight betting pattern indicates genuine strength, making a call or raise unwise with my weak draw.",

K5o from UTG is one of the worst hands you could have in the worst position. The king is dominated by any hand with a better kicker (K6+, AK, KQ, KJ, KT), and the 5 gives you almost no additional value.\n\nThe correct play is to fold and wait for a better hand in a better position.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My cards**: Ks6s (King of spades, 6 of spades)\n**My position**: BB (Big Blind)\n**My stack**: 213 chips (106.5 BB)\n**Pot**: 6 chips\n**Amount to call**: 0 (I can check for free)\n**Legal actions**: fold, check, raise\n\n**Current situation**:\n- Seat 5 (SB) posted 1 chip and called 1 more (now has 2 in pot)\n- Seat 4 called 2 chips\n- I'm in BB and have already posted 2 chips\n\nSo the action is on me to check or raise. The pot is 6 chips (2 from me + 2 from Seat 4 + 2 from Seat 5).\n\n**Analysis of opponents**:\n\n**Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)**:\n- Very tight player - has folded preflop many times (hands 4,5,6,7,10,11,13,15,16,17,18)\n- Only calls occasionally (hands 8,9,14)\n- When they do call, they often bet on flop (hand 8) but can fold on flop (hand 9)\n- Showed down Ad8h in hand 3, which is a decent but not premium hand\n- Seems to be a straightforward, tight player\n\n**Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)**:\n- More active player - has made raises in hands 14 and 15\n- In hand 15, they raised preflop to 6 and then bet 30 on flop (big bet)\n- Also calls sometimes (hands 7,9,18)\n- Can be aggressive postflop (bet in hand 7,9)\n- Seems more aggressive/tricky than Seat 4\n\n**Hand analysis**:\nKs6s is a marginal hand. It's suited, which gives some flush potential, but the kicker is weak. King-high can be dominated by better kings.\n\n**Position**: I'm in BB, which is good position postflop (I'll act last on all streets).\n\n**Pot odds**: I can check for free and see a flop, getting 6:0 pot odds (infinite). Checking is clearly +EV since I have no additional investment.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 106.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Decision**:\n- Checking is the standard play here. I get to see a flop for free with a marginal suited hand.\n- Raising would be a bluff/semi-bluff. With two callers, a raise would need to be to at least 8-12 chips. This would be risky with K6s.\n- The opponents have different styles - Seat 4 is tight, Seat 5 is more aggressive. Checking allows me to see how they act postflop and gather more information.\n\nI should check and see the flop. This is a clear check situation with a marginal hand and no investment needed.",

Only called once in hand #14 then folded. No showdown data. Likely has something decent since they called preflop.\n- **Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)**: More active. Has made preflop raises and a big flop bet (30 chips in hand #15). Can be aggressive but also folds frequently.

The only value here is the suited connector potential, but the gap is large and the cards are low. In position (on the button) I could consider stealing the blinds, but given that:\n\n1. My hand is extremely weak (J2s is a fold in most situations)\n2. I'm on the button with only the BB to act\n3. The BB has been folding a lot recently (3 consecutive preflop folds)\n4. However, I only need to call 1 chip to see a flop (pot odds of 4:1)\n5. My stack is healthy at 109 BB\n\nEven with good pot odds (calling 1 to win 4), J2s is just too weak. The reverse implied odds are poor - if I hit a J, I'm often dominated by better Jx hands. If I hit a flush, it's a low flush that could be beaten by higher flushes. The straight possibilities are minimal with this gap.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight tendency and my weak hand, I should:\n- Fold: The safe play, preserving my chips for better spots\n- Call: Could be justified given pot odds and position, but very marginal\n- Raise: Would be a steal attempt, but unnecessary risk with this hand\n\nI think folding is the correct play here.

          "reasoning_content": "  The search didn't return specific results, so I need to make a decision based on the current situation.\n\nLet me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Q2s (Q\u26652\u2660) is a very weak hand. The queen is decent but the kicker is terrible (2). It's offsuit, so no flush potential. This is typically a fold.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position. However, this doesn't compensate for the hand weakness.\n\n3. **Action**: There's already been a raise to 16 (Seat 4) and a 3-bet to 28 (Seat 5). I need to call 28 chips to see the flop.\n\n4. **Stack size**: I have 218 chips (54.5 BB). Calling 28 chips would be about 13% of my stack. If I call and miss, I'm giving up significant chips.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 50 chips (blinds + raises). I need to call 28, so pot odds are 50:28 or about 1.79:1. This is not great odds for a speculative hand.\n\n6. **Opponent ranges**: Seat 4's initial raise and Seat 5's 3-bet suggest strong ranges. Seat 5 is showing significant strength with the 3-bet.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 54.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving my stack for better opportunities is more valuable than trying to hit a miracle flop with Q2o.\n\nEven though I'm on the Button, Q2o is simply too weak to call a 3-bet. The hand has very poor equity against the likely strong ranges of my opponents. I should fold and wait for a better spot.",

It's dominated by many better aces (AK, AQ, AJ, AT, A9, A8, A7) and has poor playability post-flop.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be acting first on every street with 4 players behind me.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 218 chips (54.5 BB), which is a decent stack but not deep enough to make speculative plays from early position.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: From UTG, I should be playing a very tight range. A6o is not in a standard UTG opening range.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 6. That's 4:6 or 1:1.5 odds, which isn't relevant here since my hand is too weak.\n\nEven though I should be tight from UTG, let me think about whether a raise could make sense:\n- If I raise, I'd be raising to at least 8 chips (2x BB)\n- With A6o, I'd be building a pot with a weak hand out of position\n- I'm likely to get called by better hands and be dominated\n- The only advantage is I have an ace blocker, but that's not enough\n\nThe correct play here is clearly to **fold**. I don't need to use the memory tools for this straightforward decision - it's a fundamental poker strategy play.\n\nLet me format the response correctly:",

They called from what appears to be MP position (Seat 4 at a 5-seat table). They have 233 chips.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 10 chips (2 from SB, 4 from BB, 4 from caller). I don't need to put any more chips in to see the flop.\n\n7. **Strategy**: With 2h 4d, this is a very weak hand. I should:\n   - Check and see a free flop\n   - There's no value in raising with this hand\n   - Folding would be giving up my BB for no reason when I can check for free\n\nI should check here. No need to use memory tools - this is a straightforward decision based on hand strength and the fact that I can see the flop for free.\n\nLet me double-check the legal actions: fold, check, raise.

My hand is very weak - bottom pair with bad kicker\n2. I'm out of position\n3. MiniMax-M2 is tight and only calls preflop with strong hands\n4. The board is dangerous with two hearts and high cards\n5. There's no bet to me - I can check\n\nI should check here. Betting would be a bluff, and against a tight opponent who called preflop, that's not a good idea. I have showdown value with my pair of 4s, but it's very marginal. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to see a free card or fold if they bet.",

The turn bet of 4 into a 14 chip pot is a small bet (less than 1/3 pot).\n\n**My hand evaluation:**\n- I have bottom pair with a bad kicker\n- There are possible flush draws (hearts)\n- There are straight possibilities with 5-6 or 5-6-8-9 type hands\n- My two pair (4s and 2s) is very vulnerable to higher pairs, straights, and flushes\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 14, I need to call 4\n- Getting 3.5:1 pot odds (need ~22% equity)\n- Even if I'm behind, I might have some implied odds, but it's marginal\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I have a weak made hand that could be ahead of some bluffs\n2. MiniMax-M2 is tight and their turn bet suggests some strength\n3. \n\nI'm getting reasonable pot odds, but the hand's vulnerability makes calling risky. The small bet size could indicate a probing bet or a weak made hand. However, my bottom pair is extremely weak, and many turn cards could dramatically worsen my situation. The potential for being drawn out and the opponent's tight playing style suggest folding is the most prudent move.",

The raise sizing of 12 (3x BB) is a standard opening size.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** QJo is marginal, especially from SB. It's dominated by many better hands (AQ, KQ, AJ, etc.)\n2. **Position:** Being in SB is a huge disadvantage - I'll be out of position for the entire hand\n3. **Pot odds:** I need to call 10 to win 18, so 1.8:1 pot odds. This isn't great for a marginal hand.\n4. **Implied odds:** Limited since I'm out of position\n5. **Tournament considerations:** I have a healthy stack. Calling here commits me to a tough spot postflop out of position with a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. QJo from SB facing a raise is a losing proposition long-term. I don't have the position, the hand isn't strong enough, and I'd be playing a guessing game postflop out of position. Better to preserve my chips for a better spot.",

This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n**Position:**\nBeing on the Button is great, but with this weak hand, it's still not worth playing. The 4-chip call represents ~2% of my stack, which is small, but the hand has very little potential.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (53 BB)\n- No need to take risks with marginal hands\n- Better spots will come\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n4 chips to win 6 chips = 1.5:1 pot odds, which is not great for a hand this weak.\n\nThe opponent data shows both players have been very tight recently, but that doesn't make 6-9 offsuit a profitable call. Even if they're folding a lot, I could consider a steal raise, but since they just posted blinds, they might defend more often.\n\nThe best play here is to fold this trash hand and wait for a better spot, especially with my position and stack size.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my hand: 9d 2d in UTG position with 212 chips (53 BB). This is a very weak hand - 9-2 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- To call: 4 chips\n- Minimum raise: 8 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nFrom the opponent actions I can see:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been raising preflop with some frequency (hands 26 and 27)\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Called a raise in hand 27, then bet on flop and river\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Seems to fold frequently\n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Hand strength**: 9d 2d is extremely weak. It's unsuited, disconnected, and low. This hand has very little potential even if I hit something.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. If I call or raise, I have to act first on all subsequent streets with a weak hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 212 chips (53 BB) - This is a healthy stack. I don't need to take risks with garbage hands.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack, I should be selective and wait for better spots. Playing 9-2 UTG is a recipe for trouble.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I'd have to call 4 chips to win 6. Even with these odds, the hand is just too weak to continue.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: The players behind me have shown aggression (Seat 2 raises, Seat 4 bets postflop). With a weak hand in bad position, I'm likely to face pressure.\n\nConclusion: This is a clear fold. 9-2 offsuit UTG is a standard fold in any situation, and with my stack size and opponent tendencies, there's no justification to play this hand.",

MiniMax-M2 just called preflop (limped) - this suggests they don't have a premium hand\n2. From their history:\n   - Hand 27: Called preflop 10, then bet flop 15, checked turn, bet river 15\n   - Hand 28: Raised preflop to 20, then folded (so they raised then folded to a re-raise)\n   - Hand 24: Checked flop, bet turn 4\n   - They tend to be active post-flop\n   \n3.

Now it's my turn to act on the flop with no bet to call.\n\n**Hand analysis**:\n- I have 9 high with a backdoor straight draw (need K and something else for a gutshot to the straight)\n- The board has Qh Th 5d - two hearts, so a flush draw is possible\n- I have no pair, no draw really. Just 9 high.\n\n**Opponent analysis**:\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They fold preflop quite a bit (hands 17, 18, 20, 25, 26, 28)\n- When they call preflop, they sometimes fold on flop (hand 19)\n- They've shown aggression with raises (hands 21, 28)\n- In hand 27, they called preflop 10, bet 15 on flop, checked turn, bet 15 on river - showing they can be aggressive postflop\n- In hand 24, they called preflop 4, checked flop, bet 4 on turn\n\n**Current situation**:\n- MiniMax called preflop from CO position (Seat 4)\n- No bet on flop yet\n- I have a very weak hand (9 high)\n\n**Decision**:\nI should check here. I have absolutely nothing - just 9 high. The board has two hearts (flush draw possible) and a straight draw possible with K-J. I have no pair, no draw. Even if I try to bluff, MiniMax has shown they can call preflop and continue on the flop (hand 27). \n\nChecking is the correct play here. I have no reason to bet. \n\nI'll check and see what MiniMax does. If they bet, I'll likely fold given my complete lack of hand strength.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have 9 high with no draw on a Q-T-5 board with two hearts.

I don't have a flush draw. My hand is currently just Jack-high with no pair. This is a very weak hand.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history in seat 4:\n- They fold preflop frequently (hands 17, 18, 20, 25, 26, 28)\n- When they do play, they sometimes make small bets (hand 24: bet 4 on turn, hand 27: bet 15 on flop)\n- They made a big raise preflop in hand 21 (65 chips) and hand 28 (20 chips)\n- In hand 27, they showed down Jh Kc (Jack-high flush draw that didn't hit)\n\nThe pattern suggests MiniMax-M2 is somewhat aggressive but also folds a lot. Their current bet of 4 into a 14-chip pot is a small bet (less than 1/3 pot).\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 14 chips\n- To call: 4 chips\n- Pot odds: 4/18 = 22.2%\n- I have a gutshot (4 outs out of 47 unknown cards = ~8.5% chance)\n\nThe pot odds are not good enough to call with just a gutshot draw. Even if I hit a King, it might not be the best hand (someone could have Ace-King or two hearts for a flush).\n\n**Position:**\nI'm out of position (acting first on future streets), which makes it harder to realize my equity.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack (52 BB). I don't need to take marginal spots like this. Preserving chips is important.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should fold. I don't have enough equity, the pot odds aren't favorable, I'm out of position, and my opponent could easily have a better hand. This is a clear fold.",

Prefers raising to 12 when they enter pots.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n- AQ suited hearts is a premium hand, especially on the button\n- Great for stealing, can dominate many hands\n- I have position on both players post-flop\n- Pot odds: Need to call 8 to win 22 (about 2.75:1) - very good\n\n**My Recent Play:**\n- I've been playing very tight (25 folds out of 30 hands)\n- My win rate is low (16.7%) suggesting I might be playing too tight\n- Need to be more aggressive with premium hands\n\n**Decision:**\nWith AQ suited on the button facing a small raise (only 2x BB) and a call, I should definitely play this hand. I have three options:\n\n1. **Call (8 chips)**: See a flop in position. Conservative but gives up initiative.\n2. **Raise**: Take control of the hand. With my tight image, a raise will get respect.\n   - Minimum raise to 12 is too small - gives good odds to opponents\n   - Standard raise would be to 24-32 (3-4x the raise)\n   - Given stack sizes, I could raise to 24 (3x) or even 32 (4x)\n\n3. **Fold**: Too tight with this premium hand and position.\n\nThe best play is to raise. A raise to 24-32 will:\n- Isolate one opponent or take down the pot preflop\n- Give me initiative post-flop\n- Leverage my tight image\n- Get value from weaker hands\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2 has shown they can fold to pressure, and GPT-OSS-120B can be tight, I'll make a solid raise to 28 (3.5x the original raise), which is a standard size.\n\nLet me reconsider: The pot is 22, I need to call 8. If I raise to 24 total (3x the 8), that's only adding 16 more. That might be too small. A better raise would be to 28 or 32. Given the stack depths (everyone has 45+ BB), I can raise to 32 comfortably.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise: \"Minimum raise to: 12\" - this means I need to put in at least 12 total, which is only 4 more than the 8 to call. That's a min-raise and not recommended.\n\nI think the better sizing is to 32 total (which is 24 more to call for others). This is about 4x the original raise, standard for a 3-bet.\n\nWait, let me think about this more carefully. The \"raise_to\" field should be the TOTAL amount I'm putting in. If I want to raise to 32, that means I'm putting in 32 chips total. Since the big blind was 4, and there's been a raise to 8, I need to match that 8 first, then add more.\n\nActually, I think the \"raise_to\" means the total bet size I want to make. So if I say \"raise_to\": 28, that means I'm betting 28 chips total. Since I need to call 8, I'm raising an additional 20.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and opponent tendencies, I should make a substantial raise. Let me go with 28 total, which is a 3.5x raise of the original 8. This is strong but not overcommitting.\n\n"

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand Information:**\n- Hand #31, FLOP stage\n- My Position: BTN (Button)\n- My Cards: Qh Ah (Ace-Queen suited, hearts)\n- My Stack: 178 chips\n- Board: 5h 3c 6d (rainbow, no flush draw possible yet, but I have backdoor flush draw)\n- Pot: 70 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (Opponent checked)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n- Minimum raise to: 20\n\n**Preflop Action Analysis:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8\n- Seat 5 called 8\n- I (Seat 1) 3-bet to 28\n- Seat 4 called 20 (so they have something)\n- Seat 5 folded\n\nSo going to the flop, it's heads-up between me and MiniMax-M2.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n- I have AQh, which is a strong starting hand\n- Flop is 5h 3c 6d - completely missed me. I have no pair, no draw except backdoor flush and straight draws\n- However, this is a very dry, low board that likely missed my opponent's range too\n\n**Opponent Information (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 26: Preflop fold\n- Hand 27: Called preflop 10, bet flop 15, checked turn, bet river 15\n- Hand 28: Raised preflop to 20, then folded to a 3-bet\n- Hand 29: Called preflop 4, bet flop 4\n- Hand 30: Raised preflop to 16\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 is active preflop, raises frequently (hands 28, 30), but folded to a 3-bet in hand 28. They also make small continuation bets.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- MiniMax-M2 called my preflop 3-bet, then checked the flop\n- This suggests they likely have a medium strength hand or a draw\n- The check could be:\n  1. Weak hand giving up\n  2. Strong hand trapping\n  3. Marginal hand checking to see what I do\n\n**My Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card, see if I improve on turn. Pot is 70, I could check back and try to hit.\n2. **Raise (bet)**: Apply pressure. Since they checked, I can represent a strong hand. Minimum raise is 20 (which is a bet in this context).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- I have position (on the button)\n- The board is very dry (5-3-6 rainbow)\n- My opponent called a 3-bet preflop, suggesting some strength\n- They checked, which is often weak\n- I have 2 overcards, which are good but not great\n- Stack sizes: I have 178, opponent has 163, so deep enough\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I should be looking to accumulate chips\n- With AQ on a dry board, a continuation bet is standard\n- Checking is too passive and gives up on the pot\n\n**Decision**: I should make a continuation bet. The standard sizing would be about 1/2 to 2/3 pot. Pot is 70, so 35-45 would be appropriate. Minimum is 20, which is about 28% of pot - a bit small but acceptable as a probe bet.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Since the opponent checked to me, and the board is so dry, I should bet to take it down. A bet of 35 (half pot) would be good.\n\nBut wait - the minimum raise is listed as 20. In this context, since I'm the first to act on the flop and there's no bet to call, a \"raise\" of 20 means betting 20 chips total.\n\nLet me think about sizing:\n- 20 chips is 28% of pot (70) - small\n- 35 chips would be 50% of pot - standard\n- 45 chips would be 65% of pot - slightly larger\n\nGiven my opponent's tendency to make small bets themselves (they bet 15 into unknown pots in hands 27 and 29), a smaller bet might be effective. Also, since they folded to a 3-bet before, they might be capable of folding.\n\nI think a bet of 35 (half pot) is appropriate here. It applies pressure, charges draws, and gives me a chance to win the pot right now.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the format. It says \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount. So if I want to bet 35, I put"

This is a strong drawing hand on a dry board. I have 6 outs to top pair (3 Queens, 3 Aces), plus backdoor flush and straight possibilities.\n\n2. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the recall data, MiniMax-M2:\n   - Raises preflop frequently (hands 28, 30)\n   - Folded to a 3-bet once (hand 28)\n   - Makes small continuation bets (15 chips in hands 27, 29)\n   - Has shown they can fold\n\n3. **Board Texture**: Very dry - 5-3-6 rainbow. Unlikely to have hit opponent's preflop calling range hard. They would likely have bet if they had a set or two pair.\n\n4. **Position**: I have the button, which is a huge advantage. I can control the pot size and get information.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: Pot is 70, if I bet 35 (half pot), I'm risking 35 to win 70.\n\n6. **Tournament Strategy**: I should be accumulating chips. Checking here is too passive and gives up on a pot I could win.\n\n**Decision**: I should make a continuation bet. This is a standard play with AQ on a dry board after being the preflop aggressor. The opponent's check suggests weakness.\n\n**Sizing**: A half-pot bet of 35 chips is appropriate.

          "content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- My hand: Qh Ah (nut flush draw on the flop, now just Ace-high)\n- Position: BTN\n- Stack: 143 chips\n- Pot: 175 chips\n- Board: 5h 3c 6d Td 9h\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) with 93 chips\n- To call: 35 chips\n- Minimum raise: 70 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Preflop: I 3-bet with AQo, opponent called\n- Flop: 5h 3c 6d - I bet 35, opponent called (I had flush draw)\n- Turn: Td - I checked, opponent checked\n- River: 9h - Opponent bets 35\n\nThe board now shows: 5h 3c 6d Td 9h\n- No flush possible (hearts on 5h and 9h only)\n- Straight possibilities: 7-8 makes a straight, also 7-4 makes a wheel\n- I have Ace-high with Qh\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They fold frequently preflop (hands 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 30)\n- When they do play, they can be aggressive (hand 21: raised 16 then 65, hand 27: bet 15 on flop and 15 on river)\n- Hand 27 showdown: they had Jh Kc on board 8c 6d 5d 3h Ac - they bet 15 on river with just King-high on an Ace-high board\n- Hand 24: called preflop, checked flop, bet 4 on turn\n- Hand 29: called preflop, bet 4 on flop\n\nThis opponent seems to make small value bets and can bluff. The 35-chip bet on the river is about 20% of the pot.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 175 chips\n- To call: 35 chips\n- Pot odds: 210:35 or 6:1\n\n\n- I only need to win 14.3% of the time to break even\n\n**My Hand Strength:**\n- I have Ace-high\n- The board is relatively coordinated with straight possibilities\n- My opponent called a 3-bet preflop and called a 35-chip flop bet\n- The turn check-check suggests weakness from both sides\n- The river bet could be:\n  1. A value bet with a made hand (pair, two pair, straight)\n  2. A bluff with missed draws\n  3. A thin value bet with Ace-high (like they did in hand 27)\n\n**Opponent's Range:**\nGiven they called a 3-bet preflop and called a flop bet on 5h 3c 6d, they could have:\n- Pocket pairs (77, 88, 99, TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA)\n- Suited connectors that hit the board\n- Ace-high hands\n- Some bluffs\n\nOn the river board (5h 3c 6d Td 9h), they could have:\n- Made straights: 78, 74\n- Two pairs: T9, 96, 65, etc.\n- Pairs: TT, 99, 66, 55, 33\n- Ace-high hands\n- Complete air/bluffs\n\n**Decision:**\nThe opponent's betting pattern is interesting. They checked the turn, which suggests they didn't have a strong hand. Now they're betting 35 on the river. This could be:\n1. A value bet with a made hand that checked turn for pot control\n2. A bluff with missed draws\n3. A thin value bet with Ace-high or a small pair\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to make small bets (as seen in hands 24, 27, 29), and the fact that they called a 3-bet preflop and a flop bet, I think they have some showdown value. However, the price is good (6:1 pot odds).\n\nI need to win only 14.3% of the time. With Ace-high, against an opponent who can bluff and make thin value bets, I think I have enough equity to call. The opponent's stack is only 93 chips, so they're not betting huge relative to their stack.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that my opponent might be betting a made hand that checked the turn for pot control. The board is somewhat coordinated, and they might have hit two pair or a straight.\n\nLet me think about the EV:\n- If I call and win: +210 chips\n\n\n- If I call and lose: -35 chips\n- Break-even point:"

Let me think through this more carefully.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I have AQ (Ace-high) on a board of 5h 3c 6d Td 9h\n- Pot is 175, opponent bet 35 (giving me 6:1 pot odds)\n- I only need to win ~14.3% of the time to break even\n- Opponent has 93 chips left (short stack relative to the pot)\n\nWhat hands could opponent have?\n- They called a 3-bet preflop from me\n- They called a 35-chip bet on flop of 5h 3c 6d\n- They checked the turn (Td)\n- They bet 35 on river (9h)\n\nThe turn check is key. If they had a strong hand like an overpair, two pair, or a straight, they likely would have bet the turn. The fact they checked suggests weakness.\n\nOn the river, they could be:\n1. Value betting a made hand (pair, two pair, straight)\n2. Bluffing with missed draws\n3. Making a thin value bet with Ace-high\n\nGiven the opponent's history of making small value bets (like in hand 27 where they bet King-high on an Ace-high board), they could be doing the same here.\n\nHowever, at 6:1 pot odds, I only need to be right 1 in 7 times. I think Ace-high has enough equity against this opponent's range to call. The opponent's small bet sizing relative to the pot suggests they might be making a thin value bet or bluffing.\n\nI should call here.

From UTG (first position), this is a clear fold:\n- Very low equity against typical calling ranges\n- Dominated by many hands (AJ, KJ, QJ, J10, J9, etc.)\n- No suited potential\n- No connectivity\n- Playing from worst position\n\n**Opponent Information:**\nFrom the recent actions, I can see MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4 is quite active:\n- Raised preflop in hand #31\n- Called a raise in hand #31\n- Called on flop, bet on river\n- Seems to be playing fairly aggressively\n\nHowever, this doesn't change the fact that 7Jo is a terrible hand from UTG.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 27 BB, which is a decent stack\n- No need to risk chips with a weak hand\n- Better to wait for better spots\n- Preserving my stack is important\n\n**Decision:** Clear fold. This is an easy decision - I have a weak hand in early position with no reason to get involved.",

Let me think about the key factors:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: KhJs is a decent hand but vulnerable in early position. It's often dominated by AK, KQ, AJ, AA, KK, QQ, JJ.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act on all streets with 4 players still to act behind me.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 27 BB is a medium stack. Not desperate yet, but I need to be careful.\n\n4. **Opponents**: I don't have much history on them since the search didn't return results. Seat 2 is also named Kimi-K2 which is interesting - might be the same player type.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 27 BB, I should be somewhat selective. This is a fold or raise spot, not a call spot typically.\n\nStandard play: KhJs from UTG with 27 BB is typically a fold. It's too weak to raise from early position and too strong to open-limp (which isn't an option anyway). \n\nThe issues:\n- If I raise and get 3-bet, I'll likely have to fold\n- If I call, I'm inviting multi-way action with a hand that plays poorly multi-way\n- I'm out of position against everyone\n\nDecision: Fold.

It's not connected, not suited, and the queen is vulnerable to domination.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position post-flop. This gives me an advantage.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32), but has shown they can raise big (hand 28 with 162 chips). They just called the SB, which could mean:\n   - They have a marginal hand they want to see a flop with cheaply\n   - They're trying to trap with a strong hand\n   - They're just completing the blind\n\n4. **Stack Sizes**: I have 104 chips (26 BB), which is a decent stack. I can afford to see a flop here since there's no additional cost (amount to call is 0).\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: The pot is 8 chips and I can check for free, so infinite pot odds to see the flop.\n\n6. **Tournament Consideration**: I'm not desperate yet with 26 BB. I can afford to see a flop in position with a weak hand since it's free. If I hit something strong (like two pair, trips, straight draw), I can potentially win a decent pot. If I miss completely, I can easily fold.\n\n7. **Risk/Reward**: Checking risks nothing. If I raise, I'm bloating the pot with a weak hand out of position post-flop (since SB will act first on all streets). This is generally not advisable with Q5o.\n\n**Decision**: I should check and see a free flop in position. There's no reason to raise with this weak hand, and I have good position to evaluate post-flop.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 5d Qh (offsuit, not connected)\n- Board: 6h Js 4c\n- Position: BTN (good position)\n- Stack: 104 chips (26 BB)\n- Pot: 8 chips\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B has checked to me on the flop\n\n**Hand strength:** I have Q-high with no pair, no draw. This is a very weak hand.\n\n**Position:** I have position advantage on the flop since I'm on the BTN and acting last.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at the recall data for GPT-OSS-120B:\n- They frequently fold preflop (hands 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32)\n- When they do enter pots, they often check-fold on the flop (hands 18, 19)\n- They've made some large preflop raises (hand 21: 28 chips, hand 28: 162 chips)\n- They called preflop in hand 31 and then folded\n\nThe opponent just checked on the flop, which based on their pattern, often indicates weakness. However, I have absolutely nothing - just Q-high. The board has a J and 6, 4 - all disconnected. \n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 8 chips, it costs me 0 to check. If I bet, minimum raise is 4 chips.\n\n**Decision:** Even though the opponent showed weakness by checking, I have a terrible hand. Q-high is unlikely to be good here. The opponent could have:\n- Any pair (Jx, 6x, 4x)\n- Any draw (though not many draws on this board)\n- Or they could genuinely be weak\n\nBut with Q-high, I'm basically bluffing if I bet. While a small bluff might work given their check-fold tendencies, I also need to consider that:\n1. This is a tournament and I should be somewhat protective of my 26 BB stack\n2. The board is somewhat dry but not great for a bluff\n\n\n3. I have no equity if called\n4. I can check and see a free card to potentially improve\n\nA cautious approach makes the most sense here. Checking costs nothing and gives me a chance to see another card without risking chips. The free card might improve my hand, and I'll reassess based on the opponent's next action. Checking is the most prudent move given my complete lack of hand strength.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: 5d Qh (off-suit, low-medium cards)\n- Stack: 104 chips (26 BB)\n- Board: 6h Js 4c 2c\n- Pot: 8 chips\n- To call: 0 (I can check for free)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- My hand: Q5o (Queen-Five offsuit)\n- Board: 6h Js 4c 2c\n- I have no pair, no draw. Just Queen-high.\n- The board has a possible flush draw (clubs) and straight possibilities (3-5, 4-6, etc.)\n\n**Opponent analysis (Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see:\n- They check-fold frequently postflop (hands 18, 19)\n- They make occasional preflop raises (hands 21, 23, 25, 28)\n- In hand 28 they raised 162 chips (very large raise)\n- They seem to be a tight-aggressive player who folds to pressure\n\n**Current action:**\n- Preflop: I was BB, they were SB. They called 2, I checked.\n- Flop: They checked, I checked.\n- Turn: They checked.\n\nThis pattern suggests weakness. They've checked twice now, showing no aggression.\n\n**My decision:**\nI have absolutely nothing (Queen-high). The board is coordinated with straight and flush draws possible. Even though my opponent has shown weakness by checking twice, I have a very weak hand with no draw. \n\nChecking is the correct play here because:\n1. I have no hand strength\n2. No draws\n3. The board is coordinated and could easily have hit their range\n4. I'm out of position (though I'm actually on the button, so I have position)\n\n\n5. No value in betting - I can't get called by worse\n\nI'll carefully consider a potential bluff. The opponent's pattern of frequent folding suggests some opportunity, but my current hand is too weak to risk chips. The free card offers a chance to improve without additional investment. Checking maintains my tournament life and avoids unnecessary chip loss with a marginal hand.\n\nThe strategic move is clear: take the free card, preserve my stack, and wait for a stronger opportunity to apply pressure. Checking costs nothing and keeps my options open for future hands.",

Since the pot is small and my opponent has been passive, I should make a value bet. \n\nGiven the pot is 8 chips, a bet of around 50-75% pot (4-6 chips) seems appropriate. However, I need to consider:\n1. If I bet too small, I might not get enough value\n2. If I bet too big, they might fold\n\nLet me make a value bet of 6 chips (75% pot) to try to get called by worse hands like pairs, two pairs, or maybe a lower straight if they somehow have it.\n\nActually, looking at the board again: 6h Js 4c 2c 3c\nWait, let me recount: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 would be a straight.

The board has 6, J, 4, 2, 3.\n\nSo my cards + board = 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 = YES, I have a 6-high straight!\n\nThis is the nuts (best possible hand) on this board, since no higher straight or flush is possible.\n\nGiven I have the absolute nuts, I should bet for value. The opponent has shown passivity by checking all streets. I should make a value bet that they might call with weaker hands.\n\nGiven the pot is 8 chips, a bet of 6-8 chips seems reasonable.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand Analysis**: Td 5c is a very weak hand in the SB. It's unsuited and disconnected, with only a backdoor straight possibility.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB, which is the worst position post-flop. I'll be out of position against the BB and the caller (GPT-OSS-120B).\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 110 chips (27.5 BB), which is a decent stack. I shouldn't be taking unnecessary risks with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Opponent Behavior**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n   - They called preflop in hand #34 (from BB position, likely checking)\n   - They checked through flop, turn, river in hand #34 and then folded\n   - They called 8 chips in hand #31 and then folded\n   - Generally passive, calling and checking rather than raising\n\n5. **Current Action**: The action is to me in SB. There's already 10 chips in the pot. I need to call 2 more chips to see the flop.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I'm getting 5:1 pot odds (10:2), which is attractive, but with T5o I have very little equity even against random hands.\n\n7. **Tournament Considerations**: With 27.5 BB, I should be selective. My VPIP (voluntarily put money in pot) has been low based on my hand history - I've folded a lot. This suggests I should continue to be tight, especially from SB with a weak hand.\n\n8. **My Recent Results**: I won hand #34 with a river bet, but overall my win rate is only 17.6%. I should stick to stronger hands.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. T5o is a trash hand, I'm out of position, and even though the pot odds are good, the reverse implied odds are terrible. I don't want to get involved with such a weak hand that will be difficult to play post-flop.\n\nThe fact that GPT-OSS-120B called suggests they might have something, and I'll be out of position against both players. Better to wait for a better spot.",

It's playable from BTN\n2. Position: I'm on the button, which is great position postflop\n3. Stack size: I have 110 chips which is 27.5 BB - this is a relatively short stack but not desperate\n4. Opponents: Only SB and BB remain, both have larger stacks\n5. Pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1)\n\nLet me think about what I should do:\n- Folding seems too tight with KTs on the button\n- Calling is reasonable, keeping the pot small and seeing a flop in position\n- Raising could be good to try to steal the blinds or build a pot with a decent hand\n\nWith KTs on the button, I should be opening this hand most of the time. Since I'm on the button and it's folded to me, this is a good spot to raise and try to steal the blinds. The minimum raise is to 8 (2x the BB), which is a standard open size.\n\nI have 27.5 BB, so I can afford a raise here. Raising to 8 would be about 2 BB, leaving me with 25.5 BB if I get called or folded to.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific opponent tendencies I should consider, but the system is asking me to respond with JSON format. I should just make a decision.\n\nI'll raise to 8 chips as a standard button steal attempt with KTs. This is a solid hand that plays well postflop, and I'm in position.",

Playing J7o from UTG is -EV.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to see a flop, but even with good pot odds, this hand is too weak to play from UTG.\n\nThe clear decision here is to fold.

This sizing doesn't over-commit my 110 chip stack while applying pressure.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- I'm in SB with Qd As (Ace-Queen suited)\n- My stack: 110 chips (27.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 18 chips\n- Facing a raise from GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 to 12 chips (3x BB)\n- Need to call 10 chips to continue\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n- Hand 39: Preflop fold\n- Hand 38: Preflop check (BB), flop fold\n- Hand 37: Preflop fold\n- Hand 36: Preflop fold\n- Hand 35: Preflop call 4, flop bet 8\n- Hand 34: Turn check, river check, river fold\n\nThis opponent seems to be playing relatively tight, folding a lot preflop. When they do enter hands (like hand 35), they show aggression postflop. The raise to 12 chips from late position suggests a strong hand.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\nQd As is a premium hand, especially from SB. It's:\n- Top 5-6% hand strength\n- Strong against most ranges\n- Has good playability postflop\n- Can dominate weaker aces and queens\n\n**Stack/Pot Considerations:**\n- I have 110 chips, so calling 10 is only ~9% of my stack\n- The pot is already 18, and I need to call 10, giving me 1.8:1 immediate odds\n- If I 3-bet, I could take control of the hand\n- My stack is healthy at 27.5 BB, not desperate\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm out of position as SB, which is a disadvantage\n- However, with a premium hand like AQ, this is less concerning\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm not short-stacked, so I don't need to take unnecessary risks\n- But AQ is strong enough to play for value\n- I could 3-bet to define my opponent's range and potentially win the pot preflop\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Too tight with AQ. This is a clear fold only if opponent is extremely tight and we have strong reads.\n2. **Call**: Reasonable. I see a flop with a strong hand, keep the pot smaller out of position.\n3. **Raise**: Also reasonable. 3-betting to ~30-35 chips would be standard. This would:\n   - Define opponent's range\n   - Take initiative\n   - Potentially win preflop\n   - Build pot when I likely have the best hand\n\nLooking at my recent hands from SB, I've been folding a lot (hands 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 all folded preflop). This suggests I should start playing back with strong hands.\n\nGiven that GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop but just raised, they likely have a strong range (AJ+, KQ+, 77+). AQ is doing well against this range.\n\nI think the best play is to **3-bet**. I should raise to about 30-35 chips (2.5-3x the raise). This is standard with AQ out of position.\n\nLet me calculate the raise amount:\n- Minimum raise is 20 (to match the raise amount)\n- Standard 3-bet would be 3x their raise = 36 chips\n- I could also go slightly less, like 30-32 chips\n\nGiven my stack and position, I'll raise to 30 chips. This is a solid 3-bet size that:\n- Gives them bad odds to call with marginal hands\n- Doesn't commit too much of my stack\n- Leaves room to fold if they 4-bet big\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 110 chips and facing a 12 chip raise, if I 3-bet to 30 and they 4-bet, I might be in a tough spot. But AQ is strong enough to call a 4-bet or even shove depending on sizing.\n\nI think raising to 30 is the correct play. It shows strength, defines their range, and builds the pot with what is likely the best hand.",

My opponent called my 3-bet preflop, suggesting a decent hand, but I likely have them beat with top pair. I should bet for value against weaker Aces and pocket pairs, and to protect against any potential straight draws. Betting half pot (32 chips) extracts value while keeping the pot manageable given my 20.5 BB stack.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  The hand history shows I have A\u2660 Q\u2666 on a board of 3\u2665 4\u2660 A\u2663. I have top pair with a good kicker (Ace with Queen kicker). The pot is 64 chips and I have 82 chips left.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have top pair (Aces) with a good kicker (Queen). The board is relatively dry - only a possible straight draw with 2-5 or 5-7, but it's unlikely given the action. There's no flush draw. I likely have the best hand here.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB position. The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) is in Seat 5, which would be the cutoff or button position depending on the table setup. They have position on me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the history I just recalled:\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been playing quite tight - lots of folds preflop\n   - They made one big raise of 162 chips preflop in hand 28 (which suggests they can have strong hands)\n   - In hand 34, they called preflop, then checked down to the river and folded\n   - In hand 35, they called preflop and bet 8 on the flop\n   - They seem to be a relatively tight player who doesn't get involved much\n\n4. **Action analysis**: Preflop, they raised to 12, I re-raised to 30, and they called 18. This suggests they have a decent hand that could call a 3-bet. Their range likely includes: pocket pairs (TT+), AJ+, KQ, maybe some suited connectors.\n\n5. **Board texture**: The A\u2663 3\u2665 4\u2660 board is good for my hand but also connects with many hands that would call a 3-bet:\n   - Any Ace (but I have them out-kicked with AQ unless they have AK or AQ)\n   - Pocket pairs (but only AA beats me, and they'd likely 4-bet with AA)\n   - No real draws except a gutshot with 5 (for a straight) or 2-5, 5-7\n   \nLooking at my hand, I have a strong hand. But I need to consider that my opponent called my 3-bet preflop. They could have:\n- A weaker Ace (AJ, AT) - I'm ahead\n- A pocket pair (KK, QQ, JJ, TT) - I'm ahead except AA\n- AK - I'm behind\n- AQ - we're chopping\n- Some suited connectors or bluffs - I'm ahead\n\nGiven that I have top pair good kicker, and the board is relatively dry, I should make a value bet here. I need to charge any draws (though there are few) and get value from weaker hands.\n\nMy stack is 82 chips, and the pot is 64 chips. I should bet about 1/2 to 2/3 pot for value. A bet of 32-42 chips seems appropriate.\n\nHowever, I need to consider my stack size. I'm relatively short-stacked at 20.5 BB. If I bet and get raised, I might have to commit my stack. But with top pair top kicker on a dry board, I'm comfortable getting it in against this opponent who seems to play straightforwardly.\n\nLet me think about the minimum raise amount. It says minimum raise to 18, but that seems odd since the amount to call is 0. Let me check - actually, the minimum bet is probably 18 (maybe 1/2 pot or something). I should bet for value.\n\nI'll make a bet of about 32 chips (half pot) to extract value from weaker hands and protect my hand.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop decision:\n\n**My hand**: K3 offsuit (Kc 3s) - This is a weak hand, dominated by any other King, and the 3 doesn't add much value.\n\n**Position**: Button (BTN) - This is excellent position, last to act postflop.\n\n**Stack**: 146 chips (18.2 BB) - This is a short stack situation where we need to be careful with chip preservation but also look for spots to accumulate.\n\n**Pot**: 12 chips (blinds posted)\n\n**Opponents to act**: \n- Seat 2 (SB): Kimi-K2 with 193 chips\n- Seat 3 (BB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 196 chips\n\n**Opponent tendencies analysis**:\n\n**Seat 2 (Kimi-K2)**:\n- Very active preflop with mixed results\n- Raises frequently (hands 27, 32, 37, 39) with amounts like 12-14 chips\n- Also folds frequently\n- Showed down 7h 9d (very weak hand) at showdown in hand 27\n- Seems to be playing loose-aggressive\n\n**Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2)**:\n- Much tighter player\n- Mostly folds preflop (hands 24, 25, 27, 29-40)\n- Only calls or raises occasionally (called in hand 26, raised in hand 28 and 37)\n- When they raise, they raise bigger (30 chips in hand 37 vs 12 in hand 28)\n- Showed down Jd Qd at showdown\n- More selective with hands\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: K3o is very weak, easily dominated\n2. **Position**: Being on the button is great, but hand is still trash\n3. **Stack size**: At 18.2 BB, I should be selective and preserve chips for better spots\n4. **Opponents**: One loose player (SB) and one tight player (BB)\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 8 to win 12 (1.5:1) - not great for a hand this weak\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With a short stack, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold. K3o is not strong enough to raise for value, and calling would put me in difficult postflop spots. The loose player in SB might defend their blind, and the tight BB might have a real hand when they call.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold. This hand is too weak, especially with a short stack. I should wait for better opportunities to either shove preflop or play a hand with better equity in position.",

It's in the top 5-10% of starting hands.\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I have 7 players to act behind me. This means I need to be more cautious.\n3. **Stack Size**: 18.2 BB is in the \"medium stack\" territory. I can't be too reckless, but I have room to play.\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: From the memory recall, I see:\n   - Kimi-K2 (seat 2) has been active with raises (hands 39, 41)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) has been folding a lot\n   - MiniMax-M2 and DeepSeek-V3.2 have been folding to aggression\n\n**Tournament dynamics:**\n- I'm UTG with a premium hand. In tournaments, KQs from UTG is typically a raise or fold decision. Calling is generally not recommended from this position with a strong hand because:\n  - It invites multiway pots which reduce my equity\n  - I don't have position\n  - It gives opponents good odds to call with weaker hands\n\n**Action options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight for KQs. This is a premium hand.\n- **Call**: Not ideal. It doesn't define my hand, invites multiway action, and I lose initiative.\n- **Raise**: The standard play. I should raise to:\n  - Build the pot with a strong hand\n  - Get value from worse hands\n  - Thin the field (ideally to 1-2 opponents)\n  - Take initiative\n\n**Raise sizing**: \n- Minimum raise is 16 (2x BB)\n- Standard open from UTG with 18BB stack would be around 2.5-3x BB = 20-24 chips\n- I should raise to 24 (3x BB) to:\n  - Charge opponents adequately\n  - Protect my hand\n  - Still leave me with a playable stack if I have to fold to a 3-bet\n\n**Conclusion**: Raise to 24 chips.

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand Details:**\n- My Position: BB (Seat 1)\n- My Cards: Qs Ks (King-Queen suited in spades)\n- My Stack: 122 chips (15.2 BB)\n- Board: 9h Th 8c (9\u2665 T\u2665 8\u2663)\n- Pot: 92 chips\n- Amount to call: 16 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Action History:**\n- Preflop: Seat 3 (SB) posts 4, Seat 4 (BB) posts 8\n- Preflop: Seat 5 folds\n- Preflop: I (Seat 1) raise to 24\n- Preflop: Seat 2 calls 24\n- Preflop: Seat 3 folds\n- Preflop: Seat 4 calls 16\n- Flop: Seat 4 bets 16\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength:** I have K\u2660 Q\u2660 on a 9\u2665 T\u2665 8\u2663 board. This is a very strong drawing hand:\n   - Open-ended straight draw (J gives me a straight, any J gives me the nut straight)\n   - Two overcards (K and Q)\n   - Backdoor flush draw (spades)\n   - Gutshot straight draw to a king-high straight (need a J)\n\n2. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 92, I need to call 16. That's 92:16 or 5.75:1 pot odds. This is very favorable.\n\n3. **Position:** I'm in early position (BB), which is a disadvantage post-flop.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies:** I just looked up MiniMax-M2's actions. They have been very tight - folding most preflop hands. In hand 38, they called preflop and then bet on the flop. This suggests they may have hit this board or have a strong hand.\n\n5. **Board Texture:** The board is coordinated with 9-T-8. This is a very wet board with many possible straights and straight draws. The flush draw is also possible with two hearts.\n\n6. **Stack Size:** I have 122 chips left, which is 15.2 BB. This is a decent stack but not huge.\n\n7. **The Bet:** Seat 4 bet 16 into a 92 pot, which is a small bet (about 17% of pot). This could be:\n   - A probe bet with a weak hand\n   - A value bet with a strong hand\n   - A protection bet with a made hand\n\n**Decision:**\n\nWith my open-ended straight draw (any J gives me the nuts), two overcards, and backdoor flush draw, I have significant equity. The pot odds of 5.75:1 are excellent. \n\nI should consider raising here for several reasons:\n1. I have a strong draw and want to build the pot\n2. A raise could get better hands to fold (like weaker draws or pairs)\n3. I have fold equity\n4. If I hit my straight, I want a bigger pot\n\nHowever, I need to be careful because:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. The board is very coordinated and my opponent could already have a straight\n3. Seat 2 is still to act behind me\n\nGiven the pot odds and my draw strength, calling is definitely profitable. But raising might be better to apply pressure and build the pot.\n\nLet me consider the raise size. Minimum raise is to 32 (another 16 on top of the 16 call). A raise to about 50-60 might be appropriate.\n\nActually, looking at my stack of 122, if I raise to around 60-70, I'm committing a significant portion of my stack. \n\nI think the best play is to **raise**. I have a strong draw and want to apply pressure. I'll make it 60 total (which is 44 more than calling the 16).\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The minimum raise is to 32. If I raise to 60, that's a 44-chip raise. Let me think about a more standard size.\n\nA typical raise would be to about 3x the bet, so around 48-56. Given the pot is 92, a raise to 60 seems reasonable.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully about the raise sizing. The bet was 16. A standard raise would be to 48-56 (3x-3.5x). I'll go with 56 total.\n\nBut wait - I should also consider that if I raise and get re-raised, I might have to fold or commit my stack. With a drawing hand, that could be problematic.\n\nLet me reconsider: The pot odds are excellent at 5.75:1. My hand has good equity"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: Qs Ks (King-Queen suited - spades)\n- Stack: 106 chips (13.2 BB)\n- Pot: 108 chips\n- Board: 9h Th 8c Qd\n- Amount to call: 0 (opponent checked)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have top pair (Queens) with a King kicker. However, the board is very coordinated with 9h-Th-8c-Qd. There are both straight and flush draws possible. Any Jack gives a straight (T-J-Q-K), and there are two hearts on board for a potential flush draw.\n\n2. **My hand**: Qs Ks - I have top pair good kicker, but the board is dangerous.\n\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 (BB position this hand)\n   - They posted BB preflop, called my preflop raise\n   - On the flop they bet 16 into a pot that was ~72 (after preflop action)\n   - I called that flop bet\n   - Now on the turn they checked\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 108 chips, and I have 106 chips left. This is essentially a pot-sized bet remaining in my stack.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies from recall**: \n   - MiniMax-M2 has been fairly active preflop with raises and calls\n   - They tend to bet on flops when they have initiative (hands 29, 38)\n   - They checked turn in hand 31 after calling a flop bet\n\n6. **Current action**: They checked to me on the turn. This could mean:\n   - They're weak and giving up\n   - They have a draw and want to see a free card\n   - They're trapping with a strong hand\n\n**My analysis**:\n- I have top pair, but the board is very coordinated. Any Jack makes a straight, and there are flush draws.\n- The opponent bet on the flop (16 into ~72), which I called. Now they checked the turn.\n- This check could be weakness or a trap. Given they bet the flop, they likely have something.\n- With my stack at 106 and pot at 108, I'm in a tough spot. If I bet and get raised, I'm likely behind.\n- Checking gives a free card, which is dangerous on this board.\n- A small value bet might be appropriate, but I need to be careful.\n\n**Decision**: \nI think checking is the best option here. The board is very coordinated, and while I have top pair, many draws are possible. The opponent's flop bet followed by turn check suggests they might have a medium-strength hand or draw that they're not confident betting with again. \n\nIf I bet and face a raise, I'll be in a very difficult spot with my tournament life on the line. Checking controls the pot size and allows me to see the river card, after which I can re-evaluate.\n\nLet me check what a good raise amount would be if I decide to bet... Actually, given the coordinated board and my tournament situation, I think checking is the safest play. I want to see the river card before committing more chips.",

          "content": "  Let me analyze this river situation:\n\n**Current Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: Q\u2660 K\u2660\n- Board: 9\u2665 T\u2665 8\u2663 Q\u2666 3\u2663\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- My stack: 106 chips (13.2 BB)\n- Pot: 108 chips\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) with 257 chips\n- River action: MiniMax-M2 checked\n\n**Hand strength:**\nI have top pair (Queens) with King kicker. The board is 9\u2665 T\u2665 8\u2663 Q\u2666 3\u2663.\n\nLet me evaluate the board:\n- No flush possible (hearts don't connect, clubs don't connect)\n- Straight possible: J-9 combo makes a straight (J-9-T-8-Q) - so hands like J9 would make a straight\n- Also 7-6 makes a straight (7-6-8-9-T)\n- Sets are possible with 99, TT, 88, QQ, 33\n- Two pairs are possible\n- I have top pair with good kicker\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the search results, MiniMax-M2 appears to be a relatively tight player:\n- Hand 32: Folded to a raise from CO\n- Hand 33: Folded UTG\n- Hand 34: Folded BB, then checked down and won with Q5 against GPT-OSS-120B\n- Hand 35: Folded SB\n- Hand 36: Folded to button raise (I won that hand)\n- Hand 37: Folded to 3-bet\n- Hand 38: Called preflop, then led out on flop and won\n- Hand 39: Folded to preflop raise\n- Hand 40: Folded SB\n- Hand 41: Folded CO\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 folds often preflop, but when they do play (Hand 38), they can be aggressive postflop. They seem to play straightforwardly - folding weak hands, playing strong hands.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Preflop: I raised 3BB (24), got called by Seat 2 and MiniMax-M2\n- Flop: MiniMax-M2 bet 16 (small bet) into 72 pot, I called, Seat 2 folded\n- Turn: Check-check\n- River: Check to me\n\nThe line suggests MiniMax-M2 might have:\n1. A medium strength hand that's scared of the Q (like JJ, TT, 99, 88)\n2. A draw that missed (hearts draw, straight draw)\n\n\n3. A weaker Q (like QJ, QT)\n4. A monster checking to trap (less likely given their straightforward style)\n\nMiniMax-M2's check on the river signals uncertainty. With a pot-sized bet of 108 and 106 chips in my stack, I'm facing a critical decision that could define my tournament trajectory. The 1:1 pot odds make a value bet compelling, especially given my top pair with a strong kicker.

The board is 9\u2665 T\u2665 8\u2663 Q\u2666 3\u2663.\n\nLet me evaluate the board:\n- No flush possible (hearts don't connect, clubs don't connect)\n- Straight possible: J-9 combo makes a straight (J-9-T-8-Q) - so hands like J9 would make a straight\n- Also 7-6 makes a straight (7-6-8-9-T)\n- Sets are possible with 99, TT, 88, QQ, 33\n- Two pairs are possible\n- I have top pair with good kicker\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the search results, MiniMax-M2 appears to be a relatively tight player:\n- Hand 32: Folded to a raise from CO\n- Hand 33: Folded UTG\n- Hand 34: Folded BB, then checked down and won with Q5 against GPT-OSS-120B\n- Hand 35: Folded SB\n- Hand 36: Folded to button raise (I won that hand)\n- Hand 37: Folded to 3-bet\n- Hand 38: Called preflop, then led out on flop and won\n- Hand 39: Folded to preflop raise\n- Hand 40: Folded SB\n- Hand 41: Folded CO\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 folds often preflop, but when they do play (Hand 38), they can be aggressive postflop. They seem to play straightforwardly - folding weak hands, playing strong hands.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Preflop: I raised 3BB (24), got called by Seat 2 and MiniMax-M2\n- Flop: MiniMax-M2 bet 16 (small bet) into 72 pot, I called, Seat 2 folded\n- Turn: Check-check\n- River: Check to me\n\nThe line suggests MiniMax-M2 might have:\n1. A medium strength hand that's scared of the Q (like JJ, TT, 99, 88)\n2. A draw that missed (hearts draw, straight draw)\n\n\n3. A weaker Q (like QJ, QT)\n4. A monster checking to trap (less likely given their straightforward style)\n\nMiniMax-M2's check on the river signals uncertainty. With a pot-sized bet of 108 and 106 chips in my stack, I'm facing a critical decision that could define my tournament trajectory. The 1:1 pot odds make a value bet compelling, especially given my top pair with a strong kicker. My short stack demands aggressive chip accumulation, making this a prime opportunity to extract maximum value or potentially take down the pot.\n\nI need to carefully consider my opponent's potential holdings and the tournament dynamics. A strategic river bet could significantly impact my chip position and overall tournament strategy.\n\nThe opponent's check suggests vulnerability, creating an opportunity for a well-calculated value extraction.

When they do raise, they seem to be giving up on the flop frequently.\n\n**Current situation**:\n- I need to call 4 chips (half a BB) to see a flop\n- Pot is 20 chips, giving me 5:1 immediate pot odds\n- I would be out of position postflop\n- My hand is very weak (Q3o)\n\nGiven:\n1. My hand is extremely weak - Q3 offsuit has very little potential\n2. I'm out of position in the SB\n3. The opponent seems to be somewhat aggressive but also gives up on flops\n4. I have a healthy stack and don't need to take marginal spots\n5. Even with 5:1 pot odds, this hand will rarely win and I'll be playing out of position\n\nI should fold. The only consideration might be that it's very cheap (4 chips), but even then, playing Q3o out of position against an opponent who seems active is not profitable in the long run. \n\nI should save my chips for better spots.",

So pot odds are 28:16 or 1.75:1. This means I need ~36% equity to call.\n\n**Hand equity**: 6h 9c against a typical raising range (say 15-20% of hands) has roughly 30-35% equity. It's marginal at best.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have 26.8 BB, which is comfortable\n- I don't need to take marginal spots\n- The raiser seems tight, so their range is strong\n- I'm in position, which helps, but the hand is just too weak\n\n**Decision**: Fold. The hand is too weak, the opponent seems tight and strong, and I don't need to risk chips in a marginal spot. I can find better spots with my decent stack and position.\n\nLet me make sure I'm following the JSON format correctly.",

Even though the call is small relative to my stack, playing this hand would be -EV in the long run. I should wait for better spots, especially given my position.\n\nThe only consideration could be if I want to mix in a bluff raise, but with no information on opponents and being out of position, this would be a bad idea.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: UTG (first to act)\n- Cards: 6d Jh (offsuit, weak hand)\n- Stack: 214 chips (26.8 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- To call: 8 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- J6o is a very weak starting hand, especially from UTG position\n- From early position, I should only play premium hands\n- J6o has very little potential - no suitedness, no connectivity, and a weak kicker\n\n**My Recent History:**\nLooking at my recent hands, I've been folding a lot (36 folds out of 47 hands). This is actually good - I've been disciplined and not playing weak hands. My win rate is 21.3% which is decent for tournament play where survival matters.\n\nHand #43 is particularly relevant - I had Jd6c from UTG and folded preflop. That's the same hand structure I have now (J6o), and folding was the correct decision then too.\n\n**Position Consideration:**\n- UTG is the worst position - I have 4 players behind me\n- With a weak hand like J6o, there's a high probability someone behind me has a better hand\n- I could easily get raised and have to fold, losing 8 chips\n\n**Stack Size:**\n- 26.8 BB is a decent stack but not deep enough to speculate with weak hands\n- I need to preserve my chips for better spots\n- The 8 chip call represents about 3.7% of my stack - not huge, but it's wasted chips on a hand with very low equity\n\n**Tournament Strategy:**\n- Early in a tournament (hand #48), I should play tight from early position\n- J6o is well below my UTG opening range\n- Even if I hit a J, I'll often be outkicked\n- If I hit a 6, it's rarely going to be good enough\n\nThe correct play is to fold this hand from UTG position. It's a clear fold based on basic poker fundamentals.",

This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n**Position**: I'm in BB (Big Blind), which is good position postflop, but we're still preflop.\n\n**Stack**: 206 chips (25.8 BB) - I'm in decent shape stack-wise, not desperate.\n\n**The action**: \n- MiniMax-M2 raised from 8 to 16 (a min-raise)\n- Everyone else folded\n- I need to call 8 more chips\n\n**Pot odds**: Pot is currently 28 (4+8+16), I need to call 8, so getting 3.5:1 pot odds.\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Let me check MiniMax-M2's raising patterns. I see they frequently make min-raises (16 chips when the big blind is 8). This is their 6th preflop raise, and they seem to be raising with various amounts but often min-raising. Without showdown information, I can't tell if they're tight or loose.\n\n**Hand strength**: K2 offsuit is very weak. I only have a King high with a terrible kicker. Even if I hit a King on the flop, I'll be dominated by any other King with a better kicker. The 2 doesn't help much. This is a hand I should fold almost always.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: While 8 chips is only 1 BB, and I'm getting decent pot odds, I need to consider:\n1. If I call, I'll be out of position postflop\n2. My hand has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range\n3. I could lose more chips postflop if I hit a King and get trapped\n4. Even though I have a decent stack, I shouldn't waste chips on marginal situations\n\nThe only argument for calling is the pot odds (3.5:1) and that it's only 1 BB more. But K2 offsuit is just too weak. If the raise was from a very loose player who raises wide, I might consider it, but I don't have enough information to confirm that.\n\nI should fold this hand.

It's offsuit, low cards, and not well connected (3-gap). This is a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is excellent position, but that doesn't make up for such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: The SB (Seat 2) has shown aggression with raises, but they're short-stacked. The BB is unknown but has a medium stack.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Need to call 8 to win 12 (1.5:1). Not great odds for a hand this weak.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 25.2 BB, I have a healthy stack. I shouldn't be risking chips with marginal hands. I can wait for better spots.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold. This hand is simply too weak to play even from the button. The pot odds aren't compelling, and I don't want to get involved with such a weak holding. I should preserve my chips for better opportunities.",

J9o from UTG is too weak, especially:\n1. Out of position for the entire hand\n2. Dominated by many hands that will call/raise\n3. No strong postflop playability\n4. Tournament poker requires tighter play from early position\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot, preferably with a stronger hand or better position.",

Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B has been extremely tight, folding 9 straight hands. A 3x raise from them likely means a premium hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK, etc.)\n4. Pot odds: 20 to win 36 = 1.8:1, which is not enough for this hand\n5. Tournament: I have a healthy stack and no need to gamble with trash\n\nThis is an easy fold.

It has some straight potential but is dominated by many hands. From UTG, this is definitely a fold.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I have 4 players to act behind me. This is a clear fold situation with a marginal hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 202 chips (25.2 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to get involved with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for the player in Seat 2 (Kimi-K2), they have been fairly tight - folding most hands and only raising occasionally (hands 52 and 53). This suggests they play relatively tight, making it even less attractive to play a marginal hand against them.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips. While the pot odds aren't bad (12:8 or 1.5:1), this is not a hand I want to play from UTG.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 25 BB, I should be selective and preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nThis is a clear fold.

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has made a large raise of 113 chips, which is a significant portion of their stack (they had 113 chips and went all-in). Looking at their preflop raise history, they typically raise much smaller amounts (12-24 chips). This large raise suggests they likely have a very strong hand.\n\nI have Tc 2c, which is a very weak hand - a low suited connector but offsuit. Even though it's suited, it's still a trash hand. \n\nKey considerations:\n1. My hand is extremely weak - T2 offsuit\n2. I'm facing a large all-in raise from an opponent who normally raises much smaller\n3. I need to call 105 chips into a pot of 238, so pot odds are about 2.26:1\n4. The opponent went all-in with 113 chips, which is unusual for them\n5. DeepSeek-V3.2 called the raise with their short stack of 31 chips\n6. I'm on the button which is good position, but that doesn't matter much when facing an all-in\n7. My stack is 194 chips, so calling would cost me more than half my stack\n\nGiven the opponent's betting pattern history (small raises usually, now a massive all-in), this strongly suggests they have a premium hand like AA, KK, QQ, or AK. T2 offsuit has very poor equity against any of these hands.\n\nEven though the pot odds might seem tempting (calling 105 to win 238), my hand equity is likely less than 20% against their range, making this a clear fold.\n\nI should fold here.",

My tens are likely ahead but vulnerable. I need to charge draws and protect my hand. A bet of about 2/3 to 3/4 pot seems appropriate.\n\nPot is 48, so a bet of 32-36 chips would be good. This charges flush draws (which need about 4:1 odds) and straight draws.\n\nLet me bet 32 chips (about 2/3 pot).",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand Situation:**\n- I have Ts Td (pocket tens)\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- My stack: 138 chips (17.2 BB)\n- Board: 5c 4h 9c 5s\n- Pot: 112 chips\n- It's the turn, and I have the option to check or raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have pocket tens, which is a strong hand\n- The board shows: 5c 4h 9c 5s (pair of 5s, with clubs and hearts)\n- I currently have an overpair (my tens are higher than any board card)\n- There are potential draws: straight draws (6-7-8, 6-7-9, etc.) and club flush draw\n- However, the 5s is a relatively safe card - it pairs the board, which is generally good for an overpair\n\n**Opponent analysis (DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nLooking at the opponent's history:\n- They tend to fold preflop quite often (many folds in hands 47, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57)\n- When they do play, they can be aggressive postflop (hand 46: bet 24 on flop, called turn 24, called river 48)\n- In hand 48: called preflop, bet on flop\n- In hand 58: called preflop but folded\n- In hand 59: called a large bet preflop (113 chips)\n\n**Current action:**\n- Preflop: I raised to 24, they called 16\n- Flop: I bet 32, they called 32\n- Turn: I can check or raise\n\nThe opponent called my flop bet, which could mean:\n1. They have a hand they're continuing with (pair, draw, etc.)\n2. They're floating with a plan to bluff later\n3. They have a monster and are trapping\n\n**My position:**\n- I'm on the button with an overpair\n- The pot is already 112 chips, which is significant relative to my 138 stack\n- I have about 1.2x pot left in my stack\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: I have an overpair to the board, which is strong but vulnerable\n2. **Board texture**: The paired board (5s) reduces the chance someone has trips (they'd need a 5)\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: They can be aggressive postflop and have called two streets\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 138 left, pot is 112. A raise commits me to the pot\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I'm relatively short-stacked at 17.2 BB\n\nGiven that:\n- I have an overpair\n- The board paired, which is generally good for overpairs\n- My opponent has shown they can call and bet aggressively\n- I'm short-stacked and this is a good spot to get chips in\n- Checking might give a free card to draws\n\nI think the best play is to bet/raise here for value and protection. Since I can check or raise, and there's 0 to call, I should make a value bet.\n\nThe minimum raise is 32, but that seems small given the pot size (112). I should make a substantial bet to:\n1. Get value from worse hands\n2. Charge draws\n3. Set up a river decision\n\nGiven my stack of 138 and pot of 112, a bet of around 60-80 seems appropriate. This would leave me with 58-78 chips on the river.\n\nLet me make a bet of 80 chips, which is about 70% of the pot - a solid value bet that charges draws and gets value from worse pairs.",

Seems relatively tight but will defend with some hands. Called a 113 chip bet in hand 59, so not afraid to call with decent hands.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): Very tight! Has folded almost every hand in the recent data. Only raised once in hand 50, otherwise folding consistently. This suggests they defend their blind very selectively.\n\n**Position and Stack Considerations:**\n- I'm on the button, which is the best position post-flop\n- With 15.6 BB, I'm in the \"danger zone\" but not desperate yet\n- This is a good spot to try to steal blinds, especially against tight opponents\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- Q5 offsuit is a marginal hand at best\n- However, against two tight opponents who fold a lot, this could be a good stealing opportunity\n- If called, I'll have position and a decent high card\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1)\n- Not great odds for this hand if I were just calling\n- But as a potential steal attempt, the math is different\n\n**Decision:**\nWith two tight opponents (especially MiniMax-M2 who folds BB constantly), and being on the button with a decent stack size for a steal attempt, I should raise here. A standard raise would be 2.5-3x the BB, so around 40-48 chips. \n\nLet me raise to 48 chips (3x BB) to put pressure on the blinds. This is a good stealing spot.",

Pot odds aren't sufficient for my weak draw and limited outs.\"\n}\n```",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: Qs 5h - I have a backdoor flush draw (spades) but no pair. This is a very weak hand on a 9s 8s 3d board.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN, which is good position.\n\n3. **Action**: I raised preflop to 48 chips, and Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called. On the flop, they bet 32 into a 136 chip pot.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 to win 168 (136 + 32), which is about 19% pot odds.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2):\n   - They fold preflop very frequently (many folds)\n   - When they do play, they seem to call and bet postflop (as in hand #46)\n   - They called my preflop raise, which suggests they have some strength\n   - They showed down with Ace-high hands in the past (Ad-8h, Ad-5d, Ad-Qd)\n\n6. **Board texture**: 9s 8s 3d - This is a coordinated board with a flush draw. My Qs gives me a backdoor flush draw, but I'm behind any pair, any 9 or 8, and any spade draw.\n\n7. **Stack considerations**: I have 202 chips (12.6 BB). This is a short stack but not desperate yet.\n\n8. **The bet**: The opponent bet 32, which is less than 1/4 pot. This could be:\n   - A weak bet with a marginal hand\n   - A probe bet with a draw\n   - A value bet with a strong hand\n\nGiven that they called my preflop raise, they could have:\n- Pocket pairs (22-QQ)\n- 9x hands\n- 8x hands\n- Spade draws\n- Overcards\n\nMy hand has very little equity here. I have:\n- 6 outs to a pair (3 Queens, 3 Fives) - but even if I hit, I might not be good\n- Backdoor spade draw (need running spades)\n\nThe pot odds are decent (19%), but my hand equity is likely much lower. Even with two overcards, I'd only have about 24% equity, but I only have one overcard (the Queen).\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to call preflop raises and bet postflop, they likely have something here. My Q-high is very weak on this board. I should fold.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. The opponent bet small (32 into 136). This could be a weak bet. I have position. Maybe I could float here and try to take it away on the turn if they check. But with my stack size, I don't have much room to maneuver.\n\nLet me think about the math:\n- If I call 32, pot becomes 200\n- I'll have 154 left\n- Turn card comes, if they check, I could bet and potentially take it down\n\nBut this is risky. My hand has very little equity. The opponent has shown they can bet multiple streets (hand #46). \n\nI think the best play is to fold. I don't have enough equity to call, and I'm out of position for the rest of the hand despite being on the button (since the opponent will act first). My stack is too valuable to waste on a Q-high with no real draw.\n\nWait, I am on the button, so I have position. But still, my hand is too weak. I should fold.",

Q4 offsuit is not a good starting hand in any position.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position, but with such a weak hand, position advantage is limited.\n\n**Stack**: 202 chips (12.6 BB) - I'm in the middle stack range, not desperate yet but need to be careful.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Blinds are 8/16\n- I posted SB of 8\n- Pot is 24 \n- I need to call 8 more to see the flop (getting 3:1 pot odds)\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 is in BB with 201 chips\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Let me look at DeepSeek-V3.2's tendencies:\n- Recent actions show they fold preflop often (hands 57, 58, 61, 63)\n- They do call sometimes (hands 58, 59, 60)\n- They raised once in hand 62 to 40 chips\n- They seem relatively tight/passive\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Q4 offsuit is very weak. Even with position, this hand has poor equity.\n2. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24 (3:1). With such a weak hand, this isn't enough.\n3. **Implied odds**: Very low with Q4. Even if I hit a Q, I could be dominated by better kickers.\n4. **Tournament situation**: With 12.6 BB, I should be selective. Q4 offsuit is not a hand to invest chips with.\n5. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 seems tight, but even against a tight player, Q4 is too weak.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is an easy fold. Q4 offsuit from any position is a fold, especially with a medium stack where I need to preserve chips for better spots. The 8 chip call might seem small, but it's 0.5 BB and those chips add up. Better to wait for a stronger hand or a better situation.\n\nI should fold here.",

It has almost no straight potential (only 4-5 makes a straight), no flush potential, and very low pair potential. This is a clear fold in virtually all situations.\n\n**Position:**\nUTG is the worst position to play a weak hand from. If I call or raise, I'll be out of position against everyone else at the table for the entire hand.\n\n**Stack Size:**\nAt 12.6 BB, I'm in the danger zone but not critically short yet. However, I need to preserve my chips for better spots. With a hand this weak, I should definitely fold.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2: Mixes calls and folds, occasionally raises. Seems somewhat loose but not overly aggressive.\n- MiniMax-M2: Very tight preflop, folds most hands. Only called once in the sample.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Mix of raises and folds, but mostly folds recently. Seems to be playing tight.\n\nEven if the opponents are playing tight, 2-3 offsuit is still a clear fold UTG.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWith 12.6 BB, I need to be selective. I should wait for a much better hand or situation. Playing 2-3 offsuit UTG would be a waste of chips.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is an easy fold. The hand has very little equity, I'm out of position, and I have a short stack that needs to be preserved.",

They raised to 40 here which is unusual for them.\n- **MiniMax-M2**: More active, has made several preflop raises. They've been folding a lot recently but re-raised here.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- I have 186 chips (11.6 BB) - this is getting short\n- I need to be selective with my spots\n- The pot is already 128 chips, which is about 69% of my stack\n\n**Action analysis:**\n- Amount to call: 48 chips (about 26% of my stack)\n- This would put me at 138 chips left\n- If I call, pot would be 176 chips\n- I'm out of position postflop\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. Q8o is too weak to call a 3-bet (effectively) from MiniMax-M2, especially when:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. The raise shows real strength\n3. I have a marginal hand with poor equity\n4. I need to preserve my tournament life with 11.6 BB\n\nEven though the pot odds might seem tempting (48 to win 128 = 2.67:1), my hand doesn't play well against their likely range, and being out of position makes it even worse.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

It's not strong enough to play against a raise typically.\n\n2. **Position**: SB (small blind) - Worst position post-flop, I'd be first to act on all streets.\n\n3. **Stack**: 178 chips (11.1 BB) - I'm relatively short-stacked. This is actually a decent stack for tournament play but not super deep.\n\n4. **Pot**: 56 chips\n   - SB: 8\n   - BB: 16\n   - Raise: 32 (2x the big blind)\n   - I need to call 24 to see the flop\n\n5. **Opponent**: GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 with 108 chips (6.75 BB)\n   - Looking at their history, they fold a LOT (about 75% of hands)\n   - They do raise occasionally with varying amounts (20, 24, 30)\n   - In hand 66, they checked then made a big bet on the turn (116 chips when they had 116)\n   - They've been relatively tight/passive overall\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 24 to win 56, which is about 2.3:1 or ~30% equity needed.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: \n   - I'm in decent shape with 11.1 BB\n   - The opponent is shorter at 6.75 BB\n   - Folding keeps me in good position relative to the blinds\n\n8. **Hand strength**: Q9o is marginal.

Tournament chip accumulation is critical at this stack depth.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My Hand**: Q\u2660 A\u2663 - This is a premium hand, very strong preflop.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Best position, acting last postflop.\n\n**Stack**: 178 chips (11.1 BB) - This is a relatively short stack in tournament play. Short enough that I need to be thinking about getting all my chips in with strong hands.\n\n**Blinds**: 8/16\n**Pot**: 24 chips\n**Amount to call**: 16 (1 BB)\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): SB, 410 chips. Looking at their history:\n  - They fold a lot preflop (hands 61, 63, 65, 66, 68)\n  - When they do raise, they raise to 40 (2.5x BB in hand 62, 67)\n  - In hand 67, they raised to 40, called a 3-bet to 64, then bet aggressively on flop and turn (75, 78)\n  - Overall: Tight-aggressive when they enter pots\n\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): BB, 188 chips. Looking at their history:\n  - Generally tight, folds often preflop (hands 63, 64, 68)\n  - In hand 66, they just called SB (8 chips) and checked down to fold on turn\n  - In hand 67, they made a big 3-bet to 64 (4x BB), then called flop and turn bets\n  - Overall: Also tight, but capable of big raises with strong hands\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: AQ is a premium hand, especially on the button. It's definitely strong enough to raise with.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the BTN is excellent - I'll act last postflop.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - My stack: 178 (11.1 BB) - Short but not desperate yet\n   - DeepSeek: 410 (25.6 BB) - Big stack\n   - MiniMax: 188 (11.75 BB) - Similar to mine\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 11 BB, I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips. AQ on the button is a great spot. I could:\n   - Call: Keeps pot small, but wastes opportunity with a strong hand\n   - Raise: Standard play, builds pot with best hand\n   - All-in: Given my short stack, this could be a good move. It maximizes fold equity and gets value when called.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents are relatively tight. If I shove:\n   - DeepSeek might fold many hands, only calling with premium pairs, AK\n   - MiniMax might also fold a lot from BB\n   - With AQ, I'm likely ahead of their calling ranges, and when they fold I win 24 chips (1.5 BB) uncontested\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Pot is 24, I need to call 16. If I just call, I'm getting 1.5:1 immediate odds, but that's not the main consideration here.\n\n**Decision**: With AQ on the button and a short stack (11 BB), the best play is to go all-in. This maximizes fold equity and gets value from my strong hand. If called, I'm likely in decent shape against their ranges, and I need to accumulate chips to stay alive in the tournament.\n\nThe standard raise would be to 32 (2x BB minimum), but with my stack size, a standard raise would commit about 18% of my stack. If I get any action, I'll likely be pot-committed anyway. Going all-in now gives me maximum fold equity.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 178,\n  \"reasoning\": \"AQ is a premium hand on the button. With 11 BB stack, going all-in maximizes fold equity against tight opponents while getting value from a strong hand. Fold equity + tournament chip accumulation makes shoving the optimal play.\"\n}",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Position: UTG (early position)\n- Cards: 8s 5s (unsuited connectors, very weak)\n- Stack: 202 chips (12.6 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n8\u2660 5\u2660 is a very weak hand, especially from UTG position. It's not connected in a meaningful way (gap between 5 and 8), and from early position we should be playing very tight.\n\n**Position considerations:**\n- UTG is the worst position preflop (first to act)\n- With 12.6 BB, I'm in short stack territory\n- I need to be very selective with hands\n\n**Opponent observations from recent hands:**\nFrom the recall, I can see:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been folding preflop recently (hands 68, 69)\n- GPT-OSS-120B made a raise in hand 68 but folded in hand 69\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 has been folding preflop recently (hands 68, 69)\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 was aggressive postflop in hand 67 with big bets\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- With 12.6 BB, I'm in the danger zone but not desperate yet\n- I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call\n- From UTG, I need a premium hand to play\n- 8\u2660 5\u2660 is way too weak to play from this position with this stack size\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is an easy fold. 8-5 offsuit from UTG with a short stack is a clear fold. I don't have the chips to speculate, and this hand has very little potential even if I hit something. I should preserve my chips for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"8-5 offsuit from UTG with 12.6 BB is far too weak.

King-high with a decent kicker.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position in poker. I get to act last on every street after the flop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 186 chips (11.6 BB), which is a short-to-medium stack. I need to be careful with my chips but also look for spots to accumulate.\n\n4. **Opponent action**: GPT-OSS-120B in the SB has completed the blind (called 8). This is a relatively weak action - they just called rather than raising.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, I can see:\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been quite active preflop with many folds but also several raises (hands 55, 56, 58, 68, 70)\n   - They raised to 148 in hand 70 (big raise)\n   - They seem to be playing somewhat aggressively when they do enter pots\n   - They've folded a lot, suggesting they might be selective\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 32 chips and it costs me 0 to check (since the SB just completed). I have a free flop with a decent hand in position.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 11.6 BB, I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips, but I don't need to force anything. Getting a free flop with KTo on the button is a good opportunity to see if I hit something.\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm on the button with position\n- It costs me nothing to see the flop\n- I have a hand with decent potential (KTo can make top pair, straight draws)\n- The opponent just completed the blind, showing weakness\n\nI should definitely check and see a free flop. There's no reason to raise here - if I raise, I'm bloating the pot with a marginal hand and could face resistance. Checking allows me to:\n1. See the flop for free\n2. Keep the pot small with a marginal hand\n3. Use my position to make better decisions post-flop\n4. Preserve my stack while still having a chance to win chips\n\nI should NOT fold because I'm getting a free look at the flop with a decent hand in the best position.",

The board is 6-3-5 rainbow, which is a low, disconnected board.\n\nPot odds: 48 to win 128 (80+48) = 1:2.67 or about 37.5% equity needed.\n\nGiven this is a tournament with 11.6 BB stack, and I'm facing a large flop bet (3x the preflop pot), I should consider:\n1. My hand is weak - just King-high\n2. I'm likely behind any pair\n3. I have some backdoor draws but they're weak\n4. Tournament survival is important with this stack size\n\nLet me think about opponent tendencies. Since I don't have specific info, I need to make a general assessment. A bet of 48 into 80 is a strong bet, suggesting they have something.\n\nWith K-high on a low board, I'm likely behind. The pot odds aren't great for a pure bluff catcher. I should probably fold and preserve my stack.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have position, and this could be a continuation bet from the SB who just called preflop. They could have a wide range. But the bet size is large (60% of pot), which suggests strength.\n\nGiven my stack size of 11.6 BB, preserving chips is crucial. Folding seems correct here.",

It's not a premium hand by any means.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN) which is the best position in poker. I get to act last postflop.\n\n**Stack**: I have 178 chips which is 11.1 big blinds. This is a short stack but not desperate yet.\n\n**Pot**: 24 chips (8 from SB, 16 from BB)\n\n**Action**: Everyone folded to me. I need to call 8 more to see the flop (completing my SB), or I can raise to at least 32.\n\n**Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 is the BB with 378 chips (23.6 BB). Looking at their recent actions:\n- Hand 67: They raised preflop to 40, then called 24 more, then bet 75 on flop and 78 on turn (showing aggression)\n- Hand 70: They called 16 preflop then folded\n- Hands 66, 68, 69, 71: They folded preflop\n\nSo DeepSeek-V3.2 seems to be playing relatively tight but capable of aggression when they enter pots.\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 9-7 offsuit is weak. I have no pair, no suited connectors, not even connected cards.\n2. **Position**: Being on the Button is great, but with a weak hand and short stack, position advantage is limited.\n3. **Stack size**: At 11.1 BB, I should be thinking about push/fold territory soon, but I can still make a small call here.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, which is 3:1 pot odds. This is attractive, but with such a weak hand, even good pot odds don't justify it.\n5. **Tournament life**: With 11.1 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. This is a very marginal hand.\n\n**Recommendation**: Fold. 9-7 offsuit is just too weak to play even from the button with a short stack. I should wait for a better hand or a better spot to steal blinds. The 3:1 pot odds aren't enough to justify playing this hand, and I don't want to get involved with a weak hand that could cost me more chips postflop.\n\nEven though I'm getting good pot odds (3:1), 9-7 offsuit is just too weak. The best play here is to fold and wait for a better spot.",

          "content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - Excellent position\n- Cards: 4h 4c (pocket 4s) - Small pocket pair\n- Stack: 178 chips (11.1 BB) - Short stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n- Minimum raise: 32 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (SB): Has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 66, 68, 69, 71). Made a big raise in hand 67 (40 chips) and called 24, then bet heavily on flop and turn. Seems to play strong hands aggressively but folds frequently.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): Has been folding almost every hand (folded in hands 68, 69, 70, 71, 72). Only played hand 67 where they made a big preflop raise (64 chips) and called flop and turn bets. Very tight player.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket 4s is a marginal hand. It's a small pair that will rarely be good if it doesn't hit a set (which happens ~12% of the time on the flop).\n\n2. **Position**: Button is great position, but with a short stack and being first to act after the blinds, this advantage is diminished.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 11.1 BB is short-stacked. Tournament survival is important, but I need to accumulate chips. With a small pair, the standard play is often to shove or fold when this short.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: Both opponents are very tight and fold frequently preflop. This suggests:\n   - They may fold to aggression\n   - When they call/raise, they likely have strong hands\n   - They give up their blinds often\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: Calling 16 to win 24 = 40% of pot. Not great odds for a small pair that will rarely hit.\n\n6. **Raise/Fold/Call Options**:\n   - **Fold**: Safe, preserves 11.1 BB stack\n   - **Call**: Not great - investing 16 chips (1 BB) with a hand that will likely miss\n   - **Raise**: Could steal blinds from tight players. Minimum raise is 32, which is ~1.8 BB. \n   \nThe key insight is that I'm on the button with a short stack (11.1 BB) and both opponents are very tight, folding frequently. Pocket pairs are classic \"shove or fold\" hands when you're short-stacked. \n\nGiven that both players fold often, this is a good spot to try to steal the blinds. However, a min-raise to 32 leaves me with 146 chips if called, which is still playable. But if I'm going to raise with a small pair this short, I should probably just shove all-in.\n\n**All-in considerations:**\n- 178 chips is 11.1 BB\n- The blinds total 24 chips\n- An all-in shove gives maximum fold equity\n- Against two tight players, this has a good chance of success\n- If called, I have ~50% equity against most non-pair hands, and I'm dominated by higher pairs\n\nGiven the tightness of both opponents and my short stack, this is a good spot to shove all-in and try to pick up the blinds. The risk/reward is favorable.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Pocket 4s is not a great hand to shove with from the button. It's better to shove with hands that have better equity when called, like suited connectors, Ax, or Kx. Pocket 4s is often dominated when called.\n\nMaybe I should just fold and wait for a better spot. With 11.1 BB, I still have some time, and I can find better hands to shove with.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent data again:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2: 10 actions, mostly folds, one aggressive play in hand 67\n- MiniMax-M2: 10 actions, 5 folds in a row (68-72), only played hand 67\n\nBoth are extremely tight. A raise could easily steal the blinds. But what size?\n\nIf I raise to 32 (min-raise), I'm risking 32 to win 24. That's not a great risk/reward ratio.\n\nIf I shove 178 to win 24, I'm risking a lot to win a little.\n\nThe best play might actually be to **fold**. Here's why:\n- Pocket 4s is a weak hand that doesn't play well post-flop unless it hits a set\n- I'm out of position relative to the blinds post-flop\n- With 11.1 BB, I should be selective and wait for better spots\n"

This is a decent speculative hand that can make straights and flushes, but it's not strong enough to play from early position with a short stack.\n\n2. Position: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. With 4 players still to act behind me, I need a much stronger hand to open from this position.\n\n3. Stack size: I have 202 chips (12.6 BB), which is a short stack. With a short stack, I should be playing tighter and looking for spots to get my money in with strong hands, not speculative hands.\n\n4. My recent history: Looking at my hand history, I can see I've been playing quite tight (57 folds out of 73 hands). This is appropriate for tournament play. I've had some success with strong hands like TT (hand 60), AQs (hand 69), and 44 (hand 73) when I raised.\n\n5. Tournament considerations: With 12.6BB, I need to be careful about bleeding chips. Calling 16 chips from UTG with a speculative hand would be a mistake. If I hit the flop, I might not get paid enough to justify the risk, and if I miss, I've wasted 8% of my stack.\n\n6. The hand is suited, which adds some value, but from UTG with a short stack, this is a clear fold.\n\nThe correct play here is to fold. I should wait for a better spot, preferably in better position or with a stronger hand, especially given my short stack size.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand:** A7o (Ace of hearts, 7 of hearts) - Ace-rag offsuit, but suited\n\n**Position:** UTG (first to act) - very early position\n\n**Stack:** 226 chips (14.1 BB) - relatively short stack, in the danger zone\n\n**Blinds:** 8/16\n\n**Pot:** 24 chips\n\n**Amount to call:** 16\n\n**Legal actions:** fold, call, raise\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength:** A7o is a marginal hand, especially from UTG. While it's suited, it's still very weak. From early position, we should be playing a very tight range.\n\n2. **Position:** UTG is the worst position - we'll be out of position postflop against everyone. This means we need a much stronger hand to play.\n\n3. **Stack size:** 14.1 BB is getting short. We're in \"push/fold\" territory, meaning we should either go all-in or fold preflop. Calling is generally bad with a short stack because it commits chips without maximizing fold equity.\n\n4. **Opponents:** I have 3 active opponents with varying stack sizes. I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips or preserve my stack.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With 14.1 BB, I need to be thinking about survival and finding good spots to shove. A7o from UTG is not a good shoving hand, especially with 3 players behind me who could have me dominated (AX hands that beat me).\n\n6. **Pot odds:** I'm getting 24:16 or 1.5:1 pot odds to call, which would require ~40% equity. Even against random hands, A7o doesn't have that kind of equity multiway, and from UTG we're likely against stronger ranges.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a clear fold. A7o is too weak to play from UTG with a short stack. I should preserve my chips for a better spot - ideally when I'm in later position or have a stronger hand that I can shove with.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation carefully.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on the Button (Seat 1) with 2c 9d (offsuit, very weak hand)\n- My stack: 210 chips (13.1 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 164 chips\n- Facing a raise from Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) who is in the small blind position\n- Amount to call: 132 chips\n- This would leave me with 78 chips if I call\n\n**Opponent Analysis (GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5):**\nLooking at the recent actions:\n- Hand 71: Called preflop, then bet 48 on flop\n- Hand 72: Folded preflop\n- Hand 73: Folded preflop\n- Hand 74: Raised to 48 preflop, folded on flop\n- Hand 75: Folded preflop\n- Hand 76: Raised to 148 preflop (same sizing as now!)\n- Hand 77: Folded preflop\n- Hand 78: Folded preflop\n\nThis is very telling! In Hand 76, GPT-OSS-120B made the exact same raise sizing (148 chips) from the small blind. This is almost certainly a pattern. The fact that they folded several times and then use this exact sizing suggests it's a strong hand or a bluff sizing they like to use.\n\n**Hand strength:** 2c 9d is garbage. One of the worst hands in poker. Offsuit, no connectivity, low cards.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 132 to win 164, which is about 1.24:1. I need about 45% equity to justify a call. With 2c 9d, I likely have around 30-35% equity against a typical raising range, and probably less given this specific sizing pattern.\n\n**Tournament situation:** I have 13.1 BB. If I call 132, I'll be left with only 78 chips (4.9 BB), which is critically short. I'd be pot-committed and in terrible shape. \n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button, which is good, but with this hand it doesn't matter much.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. \n\n1. My hand is extremely weak\n\n\n2. The opponent's consistent raise sizing hints at a deliberate strategy\n3. Calling would severely compromise my tournament life\n4. The potential return doesn't justify the significant chip risk\n5. Preserving my current stack is more valuable than chasing an unlikely pot\n\nThe strategic move is to fold and wait for a stronger hand.",

I get to act last postflop.\n- This gives me more information and control.\n\n**Stack Size:**\n- I have 12.6 BB, which is a short stack in tournament poker.\n- With a short stack, I need to be selective about which hands I play.\n- I should generally look for spots to either fold or go all-in, avoiding marginal calls that commit too much of my stack.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data on DeepSeek-V3.2:\n- They fold a LOT preflop (many fold actions)\n- They occasionally raise (hands 62, 67, 78)\n- When they do raise, they tend to bet postflop aggressively (hand 67 they bet flop and turn)\n- They seem to be relatively tight-aggressive\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- I need to call 8 chips to win 24 chips = 3:1 pot odds\n- This is decent pot odds, but with my hand strength and stack size, this isn't the key factor.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- With 12.6 BB, I'm in the danger zone.\n- I should be looking for spots to either fold or shove all-in, not make small calls that commit me.\n- J5s is not strong enough to call or raise here.\n- Even though I have position, the hand is too weak to play with a short stack.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should fold. J5s is too weak to play with a short stack, even from the button. I need to preserve my chips for a better spot where I can either shove all-in preflop with a stronger hand or have better postflop potential. Calling 8 chips (0.5 BB) might seem small, but it's 4% of my stack on a very marginal hand. With my short stack, I need to be more disciplined and wait for better opportunities.",

While I have fold equity, getting called leaves me in terrible shape. Better to preserve 170 chips (5.3 BB) and wait for a stronger hand or better spot to shove.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - best position\n- Cards: Jc 5c - suited but very weak hand\n- Stack: 202 chips (6.3 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- To call: 32 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponents:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (SB): 386 chips - has been folding a lot preflop (8 folds in last 10 hands), but did raise once. Seems tight.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): 156 chips - has been very tight, folding most hands, only called twice in hand #74\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: J5s is a very weak hand. Even suited, it's not a good hand to play, especially with a short stack.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is good, but with 6.3 BB, position matters less.\n\n3. **Stack size**: At 6.3 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I should either shove all-in or fold. Calling is terrible with this stack size.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents are tight. DeepSeek has folded 8/10 times preflop. MiniMax has folded 8/10 times. This suggests they might fold to an all-in.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is 48, I need to call 32. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, but with J5s that's not relevant.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 6.3 BB, I need to make a move soon. The button is a good spot. Both opponents are tight and might fold. If I shove:\n   - DeepSeek needs to call 186 more into a pot of 234 (48+186), getting about 1.26:1 odds\n   - MiniMax needs to call 186 more into a pot of 250 (48+186+32), getting about 1.34:1 odds\n\n7. **ICM considerations**: With such a short stack, I need to accumulate chips or bust. Folding here leaves me with 170 chips (5.3 BB), still in terrible shape.\n\n**Decision**: This is a classic spot for a button shove with a short stack. J5s is not great, but:\n- I'm on the button\n- Both opponents are tight\n- I have fold equity\n- My stack is desperate\n- The suited cards give me some extra equity if called\n\nI should shove all-in for 202 chips.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The minimum raise is 64, but I can raise to any amount up to my stack. With 202 chips, I should go all-in since I'm in push/fold mode.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. With J5s, even from the button with tight opponents, this is a marginal shove at best. The equity is poor if called. \n\nBut with 6.3 BB, I need to take spots. The fold equity against two tight players might make this +EV. \n\nLet me calculate: If both fold 70% of the time (reasonable given their stats), and when called I have ~30% equity against their calling range, this could be profitable.\n\nActually, I think the better play is to fold. J5s is just too weak. Even with fold equity, if I get called I'm in terrible shape. I'd rather wait for a better spot, even with a short stack. There will be better hands to shove with than J5s.\n\nLet me reconsider one more time. At 6.3 BB on the button with two tight players... this is actually a decent shove spot. J5s has some suited connectivity. The fold equity is significant. \n\nBut I think the disciplined play is to fold and wait for a better hand. With 6.3 BB I can still wait for something like any ace, any pair, or two broadway cards. J5s is just too weak.\n\n**Final decision**: Fold. Preserve my stack for a better spot. J5s is not worth risking my tournament life on, even with fold equity.",

DeepSeek-V3.2 has been more passive/calling station type.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With only 6.3 BB, I need to be very selective. I should wait for a much better spot - ideally a premium hand or at least something with some connectivity/suitedness. T3o is one of the worst hands in poker.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold.

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: 9c 4h (offsuit, very weak hand)\n- Stack: 202 chips (6.3 BB) - very short stacked\n- Blinds: 16/32 (big blind is 32)\n- Pot: 76 chips\n- Amount to call: 16 (half of big blind)\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Players:**\n- Seat 1 (me): 202 chips\n- Seat 2: 0 chips (folded)\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): 498 chips (big blind)\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 0 chips (out)\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 188 chips (folded)\n\n**Action so far:**\n- I posted SB (16)\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 posted BB (32)\n- Seat 4 called 28 (this seems odd - they should be calling 32 if they're in a position to call, or maybe they limped for 28? Let me re-read... Actually, looking at the action: Seat 4 call 28 - this might be a typo or they called the BB of 32 but it's showing as 28 for some reason. Let me assume they called the big blind)\n\nWait, let me reconsider the action sequence:\n- preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 16 (me)\n- preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 32 (DeepSeek-V3.2)\n- preflop: Seat 4 call 28 (MiniMax-M2)\n- preflop: Seat 5 fold (GPT-OSS-120B)\n\nThis is confusing. If blinds are 16/32, and I posted SB of 16, and DeepSeek posted BB of 32, then the call amount should be 32, not 28. But it says \"Amount to call: 16\" for me.\n\nLet me reconsider: I'm in the SB position (Seat 1). I posted 16. The BB is 32. So to call, I need to put in an additional 16 to match the BB. That makes sense.\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 28. This is weird. If they're calling the BB, it should be 32. Maybe they limped from another position? But the positions shown are: Seat 1 (me, BTN/SB), Seat 2 (folded), Seat 3 (BB), Seat 4, Seat 5.\n\nActually, with 5 players and me on the BTN, the positions would be:\n- Seat 1: BTN (me)\n- Seat 2: SB\n- Seat 3: BB\n- Seat 4: UTG\n- Seat 5: MP\n\nBut the action says I posted SB 16, and Seat 3 posted BB 32. So maybe the button is on Seat 0 or the positions are shifted? Let me not overthink this. The key facts are:\n- I'm in late position (BTN)\n- I have 9c 4h (trash hand)\n- I have a very short stack (6.3 BB)\n- There's 76 in the pot\n- It costs me 16 to call\n- One player (Seat 4) has called\n- One player (Seat 5) has folded\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall data on DeepSeek-V3.2:\n- They fold a lot preflop (folded in hands 79, 82, 83)\n- In hand 81, they called preflop, then checked/called on flop, turn, and river (passive play)\n- They seem to be a relatively tight, passive player\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 9c 4h is a terrible hand. It's unsuited, unconnected, and low. Even with one caller, this hand has very little equity.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good, but with this hand it's not enough to justify playing.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have only 6.3 BB. This is a critical tournament situation. With a stack this short, I need to be very selective and look for spots to shove or fold. Calling with a weak hand is not a good use of my limited chips.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: There's 76 in the pot, and it costs me 16 to call. That's 4.75:1 pot odds. This might seem attractive, but with 9-4 offsuit, even these odds don't justify calling. The hand has very poor playability post-flop.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 6.3 BB, I'm in \""

It's offsuit, not connected, and low. This is in the bottom 10% of starting hands.\n\n2. **Stack Size**: At 6.3 BB, I'm very short stacked. With a stack this short, I should be very selective and only play strong hands. Calling with marginal hands is a leak.\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: There are 76 chips in the pot and I need to call 16. That's about 4.75:1 pot odds. While these odds might seem decent, my hand equity is terrible. Even against random hands, 9-4 offsuit has very low equity.\n\n4. **Position**: I'm on the button which is good, but with this hand strength and stack size, position doesn't help enough.\n\n5. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 is in the BB. From the recall data, they seem to be a tight player who folds a lot preflop and plays passively postflop. However, even if they're weak, 9-4 offsuit is just too bad to play.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 6.3 BB, I need to preserve my chips for better spots. I should be looking to shove with decent hands or fold everything else. Calling 16 chips (about 8% of my stack) with a trash hand is not a good tournament play.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold. The hand is too weak, my stack is too short to waste chips on marginal spots, and I need to wait for a better opportunity to get my money in.\n\nWait, let me reconsider - the amount to call is 16, which is only half the BB. Since I already posted 16 as SB, I need to add 16 more to match the BB of 32. The pot is 76 (16 + 32 + 28 from the caller).\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The action says:\n- Seat 1 post_sb 16 (me)\n- Seat 3 post_bb 32\n- Seat 4 call 28\n- Seat 5 fold\n\nIf I need to call 16, that means the current bet to match is 32 (the BB), and I've already posted 16, so I need to add 16 more.\n\nThe pot would be: my 16 + BB 32 + Seat 4's 28 = 76. Wait, that doesn't add up if Seat 4 called the BB. If Seat 4 called the BB, they would have put in 32, not 28.\n\nMaybe the structure is different. Let me just go with what's given:\n- Pot: 76\n- To call: 16\n\nSo pot odds are 76:16 or 4.75:1.\n\nEven with these pot odds, 9-4 offsuit is just too weak. I should fold and preserve my short stack for a better opportunity.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. With a stack of only 6.3 BB, I'm in desperate shape. Could this be a spot to shove all-in?\n\nIf I shove 202 chips:\n- I'd be risking 202 to win 76\n- I'd give the BB and the caller a tough decision\n- With 9-4 offsuit, it's a pure bluff\n\nBut bluffing with 6.3 BB is generally not advisable. I should wait for a hand with some equity. \n\nFold is clearly the best option. I need to preserve my very short stack for a better spot.\n\nLet me write the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9c4h is an extremely weak hand. With only 6.3 BB remaining, I must preserve my short stack for better opportunities.

This might seem attractive, but with 9-4 offsuit, even these odds don't justify calling. The hand has very poor playability post-flop.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 6.3 BB, I'm in \"",

          "reasoning_content": "  The user is asking for a decision in a poker hand. I need to analyze the situation and provide a JSON response with my action.\n\nLet me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Hand Details:**\n- My position: BTN (Seat 1)\n- My cards: 9c 4h (very weak, offsuit, low cards)\n- My stack: 202 chips (6.3 BB) - very short stacked\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 76 chips\n- Amount to call: 16 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Current Action:**\n- I posted SB 16\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) posted BB 32\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 28 (this is strange, but it seems like they called)\n- Seat 5 folded\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: 9c 4h is an extremely weak hand. It's offsuit, not connected, and low. This is in the bottom 10% of starting hands.\n\n2. **Stack Size**: At 6.3 BB, I'm very short stacked. With a stack this short, I should be very selective and only play strong hands. Calling with marginal hands is a leak.\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: There are 76 chips in the pot and I need to call 16. That's about 4.75:1 pot odds. While these odds might seem decent, my hand equity is terrible. Even against random hands, 9-4 offsuit has very low equity.\n\n4. **Position**: I'm on the button which is good, but with this hand strength and stack size, position doesn't help enough.\n\n5. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 is in the BB. From the recall data, they seem to be a tight player who folds a lot preflop and plays passively postflop. However, even if they're weak, 9-4 offsuit is just too bad to play.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 6.3 BB, I need to preserve my chips for better spots. I should be looking to shove with decent hands or fold everything else. Calling 16 chips (about 8% of my stack) with a trash hand is not a good tournament play.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold. The hand is too weak, my stack is too short to waste chips on marginal spots, and I need to wait for a better opportunity to get my money in.\n\nWait, let me reconsider - the amount to call is 16, which is only half the BB. Since I already posted 16 as SB, I need to add 16 more to match the BB of 32. The pot is 76 (16 + 32 + 28 from the caller).\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The action says:\n- Seat 1 post_sb 16 (me)\n- Seat 3 post_bb 32\n- Seat 4 call 28\n- Seat 5 fold\n\nIf I need to call 16, that means the current bet to match is 32 (the BB), and I've already posted 16, so I need to add 16 more.\n\nThe pot would be: my 16 + BB 32 + Seat 4's 28 = 76. Wait, that doesn't add up if Seat 4 called the BB. If Seat 4 called the BB, they would have put in 32, not 28.\n\nMaybe the structure is different. Let me just go with what's given:\n- Pot: 76\n- To call: 16\n\nSo pot odds are 76:16 or 4.75:1.\n\nEven with these pot odds, 9-4 offsuit is just too weak. I should fold and preserve my short stack for a better opportunity.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. With a stack of only 6.3 BB, I'm in desperate shape. Could this be a spot to shove all-in?\n\nIf I shove 202 chips:\n- I'd be risking 202 to win 76\n- I'd give the BB and the caller a tough decision\n- With 9-4 offsuit, it's a pure bluff\n\nBut bluffing with 6.3 BB is generally not advisable. I should wait for a hand with some equity. \n\nFold is clearly the best option. I need to preserve my very short stack for a better spot.\n\nLet me write the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9c4h is an extremely weak hand. With only 6.3 BB remaining, I must preserve my short stack for better opportunities.

This is definitely a folding hand from UTG.\n\n**Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position preflop as I have to act first on every street. I need to play very tight from this position.\n\n**Stack**: 202 chips (6.3 BB) - I'm in the danger zone with less than 10 big blinds. This means I need to be looking for spots to shove all-in or fold. I cannot afford to call and then fold on later streets.\n\n**Blinds**: 16/32 - The blinds are getting high relative to my stack.\n\n**Pot**: 48 chips\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 486 chips (15 BB) - healthy stack\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 56 chips (1.75 BB) - very short, desperate\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 156 chips (4.9 BB) - also short\n\nFrom the opponent actions I recalled:\n- Recent hands show a lot of folding preflop from all opponents\n- MiniMax-M2 called 28 chips in hand #84 (when blinds were likely lower)\n- Generally seems like opponents are playing somewhat tight\n\n**Decision**: With T7o from UTG and only 6.3 BB, this is a clear fold. This hand is:\n1. Too weak to open-shove from UTG\n2. Not strong enough to call 32 chips (16% of my stack)\n3. Would leave me in terrible position post-flop if I call\n4. I need to preserve my chips for a much better spot\n\nI should wait for a better hand (any pocket pair, any Ace, any two Broadway cards, or suited connectors) before committing my chips, especially from early position.",

They can fold preflop but also make big bets when they have something.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nQ\u2665 5\u2666 is a marginal hand:\n- Offsuit\n- Not connected\n- Queen is decent but kicker is terrible\n- Not a good hand to play in general\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm extremely short stacked at 5.8 BB\n- On the button with only BB to act\n- I need to make a move soon or blind out\n- Q5o is not a great hand, but given my stack size and position, I should consider shoving\n\n**Decision:**\nWith 5.8 BB on the button and only the BB left to act, this is actually a decent spot to shove all-in. Even with a marginal hand like Q5o, the fold equity plus the chance to win the blinds makes this profitable. \n\nIf I call, I see a flop but will be pot-committed anyway with my short stack. Better to take the aggressive action now.\n\nLet me shove all-in for 186 chips.",

All-in shove applies maximum pressure and gives me two ways to win: they fold or I have decent equity if called.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- Cards: 5h Ad (Ace with a weak kicker)\n- Stack: 234 chips (7.3 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- Amount to call: 32\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 3 (SB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 482 chips - has been fairly active, showing some raises and calls\n- Seat 4 (BB): MiniMax-M2 with 184 chips - has been somewhat tight but has raised in the past\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A5 offsuit is a decent hand, especially with an Ace. But the 5 kicker is weak. This hand plays better as a steal or all-in hand when short-stacked.\n\n2. **Stack size**: At 7.3 BB, I'm in the danger zone. I need to be looking for spots to either double up or steal blinds. Calling here would leave me with ~200 chips (6.25 BB), which doesn't improve my situation much.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - DeepSeek in SB: Has shown both folds and aggression. They called 32 chips in hand 81, raised to 96 in hand 86. They seem to defend their blind sometimes but also fold a lot.\n   - MiniMax in BB: Generally tighter but has shown some aggression. They raised to 64 in hand 81, called in other spots. They have a medium stack at 184 chips (5.75 BB).\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 7.3 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Calling 32 chips would commit ~14% of my stack with a marginal hand and I'd be out of position postflop (though I'm on the button, I'd act last preflop but the action goes SB, BB, then me postflop).\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Calling 32 to win 48 = 1.5:1 odds, which isn't great for A5o.\n\n6. **Best play**: Given my short stack and position, this is a good spot to either:\n   - Fold and wait for a better spot (preserve chips)\n   - Go all-in (234 chips) as a steal attempt, putting pressure on both opponents\n\nLooking at the opponent history:\n- MiniMax (BB) has shown they can fold to pressure (folded multiple times)\n- DeepSeek (SB) also folds frequently\n\nWith A5o on the button, this is a decent hand to shove with. It has blocker value (Ace blocks AA, AK, AQ, AJ) and decent equity against calling ranges.\n\nIf I shove 234 chips:\n- MiniMax would need to call 202 more (they have 184, so they'd be all-in)\n- DeepSeek would need to call 218 more (they have 482)\n\nGiven their stacks and that they'd both be at risk (especially MiniMax), I think there's a good chance they fold.\n\n**Decision**: Shove all-in with A5o from the button with 7.3 BB. This is a standard short-stack play to steal blinds and either double up or take down the pot uncontested.\n\nThe raise_to should be 234 (my total stack).",

DeepSeek-V3.2 has shown they can raise with strong hands and bet aggressively postflop. Folding maintains 186 chips (5.8 BB) for a better opportunity.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent's history:\n\nDeepSeek-V3.2 has:\n- Folded a lot (hands 76, 77, 79, 82, 83, 85, 87, 88)\n- Made some raises (hands 78, 86)\n- Made a raise to 96 in hand 86, then called a re-raise, and bet big on the flop (192)\n- In hand 81, they called multiple times and played passively\n\nThe current raise is to 96, which is a 3x raise from the 32 BB. This is a standard raise size for them based on hand 86 where they also raised to 96.\n\nI have Kd 2c in the BB. This is a very weak hand - King with a terrible kicker. I'm out of position against a raiser who has shown they can have strong hands.\n\nMy stack is 250 chips (7.8 BB). The pot is 144 and I need to call 64. That means I'm getting pot odds of 144:64 or about 2.25:1.\n\nIf I call, I'd be putting in 64 chips, leaving me with 186 chips. The pot would be 208 going to the flop.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Hand strength: Very weak - K2o is one of the worst hands in poker\n2. Position: Bad - I'm out of position in BB\n3. Opponent: Has shown they can raise with strong hands and bet aggressively postflop\n4. Stack size: I'm short stacked at 7.8 BB\n5. Pot odds: 2.25:1 which isn't great for a hand this weak\n\nWith a short stack and a weak hand, I should either fold or shove all-in. Calling 64 chips and leaving myself with 186 chips would be awkward - I'd have less than 6 BB left and would be out of position.\n\nIf I shove all-in for 250:\n- The raise would be to 250 total (adding 154 more)\n- DeepSeek would need to call 154 to win 394 (the 144 pot + my 250)\n- That's about 2.56:1 odds for them\n\nHowever, K2o is just too weak. Even if they're raising wide, I'm dominated by so many hands (any Ace, any King with better kicker, any pair, etc.). The only hands I'm really ahead of are complete bluffs or very weak holdings.\n\nGiven my short stack, I should preserve my chips for a better spot. Folding is the correct play here. I can wait for a better hand or better position.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The pot is already 144 and I need to call 64. That's a lot of chips to give up. But K2o is truly terrible. Let me think about the math:\n\nIf I call 64, pot is 208, I have 186 left.\nIf I miss the flop (which is likely), I'm in a tough spot out of position.\nIf I hit a King, I have a terrible kicker and could lose a lot.\nIf I hit a 2, it's not likely to be good.\n\nThe best case is hitting two pair or trips, but that's very unlikely (about 2.5% chance of hitting two pair or better).\n\nI think folding is still correct. Preserve the 186 chips for a better spot. I need to be patient with my short stack.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: 8s Td - This is a mediocre hand. It's offsuit and the cards are not connected. Not a strong starting hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position postflop, but we're preflop now.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 234 chips, which is only 7.3 BB. I'm in a critical tournament situation - very short stacked.\n\n4. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 is in the BB with 498 chips (healthy stack). From the recall data, I can see:\n   - They fold quite often preflop (hands 77, 79, 82, 83, 85, 87, 88 - 7 folds out of 13 preflop actions)\n   - When they do raise, they raise to 48 or 96 (which are 1.5x and 3x BB at 32/16 blind level)\n   - They called a raise in hand 86 and then bet aggressively on the flop (192 chips)\n   - In hand 81, they called preflop and then called down on flop and turn\n   \n   This suggests they're reasonably tight but capable of playing back when they enter pots.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 16 to win 48 (3:1 odds). That's 25% equity needed.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 7.3 BB, I'm in shove/fold territory. I should be looking for spots to get my chips in with decent equity.\n\n8s Td is not a strong enough hand to call here. Even though I'm getting 3:1 odds, this hand plays poorly postflop and I don't want to commit chips with a marginal holding when I should be looking for spots to shove with fold equity or strong hands.\n\nI should fold here and preserve my chips for a better spot. There's no need to call 16 chips (which is 2.2% of my stack) with a weak hand that will be difficult to play postflop.",

Seems to play somewhat tight-aggressive.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): Very tight preflop, mostly folding. Only called a few times with small amounts.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 4d 3c is one of the weakest starting hands in poker. It's offsuit, not connected (gap), and very low. This hand has almost no showdown value.\n\n2. **Stack size**: With only 7.3 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call.\n\n3. **Position**: Being on the button is great, but with this hand it doesn't matter much.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: I'm very short stacked. I need to preserve my chips for better spots or look for steal opportunities. However, 43o is not a hand to steal with.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 to win 48 (1.5:1). These aren't great odds for a hand this weak.\n\n**Decision**: Even though I'm short stacked and in position, 43o is simply too weak to play here. I should wait for a better hand or a better spot to shove. The opponents seem somewhat tight, but calling 32 chips (about 14% of my stack) with this garbage hand would be a mistake.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

The pot odds don't justify calling with such a weak holding when I'm risking 16% of my stack.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on BTN with J4 offsuit (4d Jh)\n- I have 202 chips (6.3 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds are 16/32\n- Pot is 96 chips (2 BB from blinds + 64 from SB's raise)\n- MiniMax-M2 in SB raised to 64 (2x the BB)\n- I need to call 32 to continue\n\n**My hand:** J4 offsuit is a very weak hand. In general, J4o should be folded in most situations.\n\n**Stack considerations:** With 6.3 BB, I'm in short stack territory. I need to be very selective about which hands I play. J4o is definitely not a hand worth risking chips with at this stack depth.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Very tight player - folds most preflop (hands 83, 87, 88, 89, 90)\n- Only calls occasionally (hands 84, 86, 91)\n- The raise from SB is unusual for this player - they've been mostly folding or calling, not raising\n\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 likely has a strong hand when they do raise. They've only shown aggression when they likely have premium holdings.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 32 to win 96, which is 3:1 pot odds. While this might seem tempting, with J4o I'm unlikely to realize my equity, especially out of position (I'll be first to act postflop).\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 6.3 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. J4o is not a hand I want to invest 16% of my stack (32/202) with. I should wait for a better opportunity, preferably in position with a stronger hand, or look for spots to shove all-in as a steal.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. This is a clear fold with a weak hand against a tight opponent's raise.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 8c 7c - Suited connectors, could be good for stealing or seeing flops cheaply\n**My Stack**: 186 chips (5.8 BB) - This is a short stack, in desperate need of a double-up\n**Position**: BTN - Best position at the table\n**Blinds**: 16/32\n**Pot**: 48 chips\n**To call**: 32 chips\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Has been active, raising preflop frequently (hands 86, 89, 91). Shown down with K9, pocket 9s, pocket 8s. Seems like a solid player who raises with decent hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Much more selective. Has folded many hands, only calling occasionally. Shown down with strong hands like AK, AJ. Seems tight.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. With 5.8 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Calling 32 chips (17% of my stack) with 87s is not ideal.\n2. I have position on both opponents.\n3. The BB (Seat 4) is tight and likely to fold to pressure.\n4. The SB (Seat 3) is more active but could fold to an all-in.\n\n**Options**:\n- **Fold**: Preserves 154 chips (4.8 BB), but I'm bleeding out. Not great.\n- **Call**: Cost 32 chips, leaving 154 chips. With 87s I want to see flops cheaply, but this is 17% of my stack.\n- **Raise**: Minimum raise to 64 (33% of stack), or I could shove all-in for 186.\n\nGiven my short stack and position, and that both opponents could fold, a shove here makes sense. It's a classic squeeze play. 87s has decent equity when called, and I have fold equity.\n\nLet me calculate: If I shove 186:\n- SB needs to call 170 more (has 610 stack)\n- BB needs to call 154 more (has 104 stack)\n\nThe tight BB might fold many hands, and the active SB might also fold without a premium.\n\nThis is a good spot for an all-in steal.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the hand:\n- I'm in BB with J2o (2s Jd) - this is a very weak hand\n- My stack is 202 chips (6.3 BB) - I'm short-stacked\n- Pot is 96 chips\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 called 32\n- MiniMax-M2 (SB) called 16\n- It's checked to me with 0 to call\n\nOpponent tendencies:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2: Has been active with raises and calls, but also folds. In hand 86 they raised preflop, called, then bet flop. In hand 91 they raised preflop and bet flop. They seem to be an active player who bets when they have initiative.\n- MiniMax-M2: Very tight - mostly folding, with occasional calls and one raise in hand 92. Only 72 chips left (2.25 BB), so they're extremely short.\n\nWith J2o in BB:\n- This is a trash hand that should almost always be folded\n- However, I get to see a free flop with 0 to call\n- Pot is 96 chips and I have 202 chips - that's a significant pot relative to my stack\n- I could check and see the flop for free, then evaluate\n\nTournament considerations:\n- I'm short-stacked at 6.3 BB\n- However, I have two opponents who are also short: MiniMax-M2 at 2.25 BB\n- The pot is already decent sized at 96 chips (3 BB)\n- If I hit any piece of the flop, I might be able to win a decent pot\n\nGiven that it's FREE to see the flop (0 to call), and the pot is already 96 chips (nearly half my stack), I should check and see the flop. Even with a terrible hand, getting a free look at a multi-way pot when I'm short-stacked is worth it. If I don't hit the flop, I can easily fold. The risk is zero and the potential reward is significant.",

Bottom pair with bad kicker on a coordinated board with potential flush and straight draws.\n2. **Stack Size**: I have 202 chips (6.3 BB) - very short stacked myself\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 has only 40 chips left after betting 32.

Even with 5:1 pot odds, I probably don't have enough equity with bottom pair and weak kicker. The board has multiple draws that could easily beat me.

Seems somewhat active but not overly aggressive.\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3): Generally passive - folded in hands 92 and 94, called in hand 95 but folded to a flop bet.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With only 5.8 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. I cannot afford to call and then fold postflop - that would be chip suicide.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 80, which is 5:1 pot odds. Even with these odds, 5-2 offsuit is just too weak.\n\n8. **Decision**: This is a clear fold. With a trash hand like 5-2 offsuit, out of position, and a critically short stack, I cannot invest any chips here. I need to preserve my remaining stack for a better spot - ideally when I can be first to act (shove all-in) with a decent hand or in late position.\n\nThe fact that MiniMax-M2 called suggests they might have some kind of hand, but even if they have random cards, my 5-2 offsuit is at a huge disadvantage against any random hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity to shove with a hand that has some equity.",

They raised preflop in hand 91, folded a few times, called in hand 95 then folded on flop, checked in hand 96. Seems somewhat tight-aggressive.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): 72 chips, also short-stacked. They've been calling and betting postflop. They raised in hand 92, called in hands 95 and 96, and bet on flop in both. Seems to defend their blind and play postflop.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: KTs is a decent hand, especially from the button. It has good potential for straights, flushes, and top pair with decent kicker.\n\n2. **Stack size**: I'm at 5.8 BB, which is critical. In tournament poker, when you're this short, you generally want to either shove (all-in) or fold preflop. Calling is rarely optimal because it commits too much of your stack without maximizing fold equity.\n\n3. **Position**: Being on the button is great - I act last postflop.\n\n4. **Opponent stacks**: \n   - MiniMax-M2 only has 72 chips (2.25 BB) in the BB. If I raise, they might be forced to call with a wide range or fold.\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 has a big stack (642 chips) and could apply pressure.\n\n5. **Tournament situation**: With 5.8 BB, I need to make a move soon. KTs is definitely in my shoving range from the button.\n\n**Decision**: With KTs on the button and only 5.8 BB, this is a clear shove (all-in) situation. I have fold equity against the BB who is also short, and my hand has good equity against their calling ranges. If I just call 32, I'd have 154 chips left (4.8 BB) which is still very short and I'd be out of position postflop.\n\nI should raise all-in for 186 chips total.",

Let me assume the position label is correct and I'm on the Button, which means the blinds are posted differently than usual. Actually, looking at the players: Seat 1 is me, Seat 2 is out, Seat 3 is BB, Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 is out. So it seems like Seat 3 is the only blind posted.\n\nActually, re-reading: \"preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 16\" and \"preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 32\". So I posted the small blind. But my position is listed as BTN. This might be a heads-up situation or the button just passed. In any case, I'm in the SB position with 16 already invested.\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\n1. **Fold**: Give up 16 chips, preserve 218 chips (6.8 BB). With a tight BB, folding might be too nitty.\n2. **Call**: Invest 16 more to see flop with J7s. Not great with a short stack.\n3. **Raise**: \n   - Minimum raise to 64 (putting in 48 more chips)\n   - This would be a steal attempt against a tight player\n   - Risking 48 to win 48 (immediate 1:1 odds)\n   - If called, I have position and a hand with some potential\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm very short-stacked (7.3 BB)\n- The BB player is very tight (folds preflop a lot)\n- I have position\n- J7s has decent stealing potential\n\nThis is a good spot for a raise/fold steal attempt. However, I need to be careful not to risk too much of my stack with a marginal hand.\n\nIf I raise to 64 and get re-raised, I'd have to fold, losing 48 chips and dropping to ~5.8 BB.\nIf I raise to 64 and BB folds, I win 48 chips and increase my stack to 282 chips (8.8 BB).\n\nGiven the opponent's tightness, a raise seems profitable. However, with such a short stack, I could also consider just shoving all-in. Let me calculate:\n\nAll-in: 234 chips total\n- Already have 16 in, so 218 more\n- BB would need to call 202 more (234 - 32)\n- Pot would be 48 + 218 = 266\n- BB would be getting 266:202 or ~1.32:1 odds\n\nWith J7s, going all-in is probably too loose.

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in SB (Seat 1) with 7c Jc\n- Stack: 234 chips (7.3 BB)\n- Already posted 16 as SB\n- Need to call 16 more to see flop (total 32)\n- BB is DeepSeek-V3.2 with 610 chips\n- Pot is 48 chips (16 SB + 32 BB)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nDeepSeek-V3.2 appears to be very tight based on the hand history I can recall:\n- Folded preflop in hands 92, 94, 97, 98\n- Only called once in hand 95 and folded on flop\n- In hand 96, checked BB, checked flop, called a bet, then bet on turn\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: J7s is marginal but has some playability, especially in position\n2. **Stack size**: I'm short with 7.3 BB - need to be selective but also look for +EV spots\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight BB who folds to pressure\n4. **Position**: I have position postflop (acting last)\n5. **Pot odds**: Calling 16 to win 48 (3:1) - decent odds for a speculative hand\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too weak with a tight BB and decent pot odds\n- **Call**: See flop for 16 more with position, but with short stack this commits me somewhat\n- **Raise**: Steal attempt. Minimum raise to 64 means putting in 48 more to win 48\n\nWith a very tight BB who folds a lot, a raise to 64 seems like a good steal attempt. However, with only 7.3 BB, I should be more aggressive and either fold or push. \n\nActually, let me reconsider: With 7.3 BB and J7s, I should either fold or go all-in. A min-raise to 64 would be weird with my stack size - if I'm going to raise, I should just shove.\n\nBut going all-in with J7s is too loose. Let me check the math:\n- If I fold: I keep 218 chips (6.8 BB)\n- If I call: I see flop for 16 more, have position, and can evaluate\n- If I raise to 64: I risk 48 to win 48 against a tight player\n\nThe call seems most reasonable. I have position, decent pot odds (3:1), and a hand that can flop some equity (pairs, flush draws, straight draws). If I miss the flop completely, I can fold and still have 6.8 BB.\n\nActually wait, I already have 16 invested. The pot is 48 and I need to call 16. That's 3:1 pot odds. With J7s and position against a tight player, calling is reasonable. I can steal on many flops or hit something decent.\n\nLet me go with call.",

I have:\n1. A strong draw (9 outs to flush)\n2. Position (on the button)\n3. A passive opponent who checked preflop\n4. Urgent need to accumulate chips\n\nI should bet here to:\n- Build the pot for when I hit\n- Take control of the hand\n- Potentially win the pot right now\n- Put pressure on my opponent\n\nGiven my stack size (218) and the pot (64), a good bet size would be around 1/2 to 2/3 pot, so about 32-48 chips. I'll go with a moderate bet of 48 chips (3/4 pot).\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The minimum raise is 32, which is exactly half the pot. That's a reasonable size. But given my short stack and the strength of my draw, I might want to bet more to build the pot and potentially set up a shove on the turn if I hit.\n\nActually, with 218 chips and a pot of 64, betting 48 (3/4 pot) seems good. This gives me good fold equity and builds the pot nicely.\n\nLet me go with a bet of 48 chips.",

Not a premium hand.\n\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - This is excellent position, the best at the table.\n\n**Stack:** 282 chips (8.8 BB) - I'm in short stack territory. This is critical. With less than 10 big blinds, I need to be looking for spots to either shove or fold. I don't have room to play speculative hands.\n\n**Blinds:** 16/32 - So the big blind is 32 chips.\n\n**Pot:** 48 chips (SB + BB)\n\n**Opponents:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (SB): 594 chips (deep stacked)\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): 24 chips (extremely short stacked, less than 1 BB)\n\n**Action:** I'm facing a 32 chip call.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n\nDeepSeek-V3.2 (SB):\n- Hand 95: Called preflop, folded on flop\n- Hand 96: Checked preflop, checked flop, called flop bet, bet turn\n- Hand 97: Folded preflop\n- Hand 98: Folded preflop\n- Hand 99: Checked preflop, folded on flop\n\nSeems like a relatively tight player, defends SB sometimes but often folds. When they see flops, they can be active.\n\nMiniMax-M2 (BB):\n- Hand 93: Folded preflop\n- Hand 94: Folded preflop\n- Hand 95: Called preflop, bet flop\n- Hand 96: Called preflop, bet flop, folded turn\n- Hand 97: Folded preflop\n- Hand 98: Folded preflop\n- Hand 99: Folded preflop\n\nThis player is very tight, folding most hands preflop. But when they do play (hands 95, 96), they bet aggressively postflop.\n\n**Tournament Situation:** I'm down to 8.8 BB. This is critical. I need to preserve my stack or find good spots to double up. With K9o on the button, facing a 32 chip call:\n\n- The BB (MiniMax-M2) has only 24 chips total. They're essentially all-in already if they play.\n- The SB (DeepSeek-V3.2) has a big stack and could defend.\n\n**Pot Odds:** Calling 32 to win 48 = 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed. This is not relevant for tournament short-stack play though.\n\n**Decision:** With 8.8 BB, K9o is NOT a good enough hand to call or raise. It's dominated by many hands (any Ace, any King with better kicker, pairs). I should be shoving with much stronger hands (any Ace, any pair, broadway cards). K9o is too weak.\n\nThe fact that MiniMax-M2 in the BB has only 24 chips means if I raise, they might call with any two cards. If I just call, I'm letting DeepSeek-V3.2 in the SB see a cheap flop with their big stack, which is dangerous.\n\nBest play: FOLD. Preserve my 8.8 BB stack for a better spot. I should be looking for hands like any Ace, any pair, or at least KJ+ or QJ+ to make a stand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"With only 8.8 BB, K9o is too weak to play from any position.

Given the pot odds and my desperation stack, I should either fold or shove. Calling 96 and leaving 122 behind would be terrible - I'd be pot-committed anyway.\n\nLet me consider shoving:\n- If I shove 218, I'm risking 218 to win 248 + 96 = 344\n- Getting 1.6:1 on my money\n- If opponent folds, I win 248 chips immediately (increase stack by 114%)\n- If called, I have decent equity with A8o\n\nGiven my desperation stack size and the decent pot odds, I think the best play is to shove all-in. This maximizes fold equity and gives me a chance to double up or win the pot outright.\n\nActually, wait - I need to check if \"raise\" is in my legal actions. It is: fold, call, raise. And the minimum raise is 256, but I only have 218, so I can go all-in for 218.",

When I \"raised 256\", that would have been my entire stack, but I only had 26 chips left after posting. Let me think about this...\n\nActually, looking at the action:\n- preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 64 (I posted 64, leaving me with 26)\n- preflop: Seat 3 raise 160\n- preflop: Seat 1 raise 256 (this must be all-in for my remaining 26)\n- preflop: Seat 3 call 96\n\nSo I went all-in preflop for my remaining 26 chips, and Seat 3 called. The \"raise 256\" is likely a display error or represents the total pot size or something. The key is I have 26 chips left and the action is on me on the flop.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nFrom the recall, I can see:\n- They check frequently on flop (hands 96, 99, 100)\n- They make small bets on turn (72, 32)\n- They've folded preflop a few times (hands 97, 98, 99)\n- They called preflop in hand 100 with a small amount\n\nGiven that I'm already all-in (or essentially all-in with 26 chips in a 536 pot), and it's 0 to call, I should check and see the showdown.\n\n**Decision:**\nI have top pair, weak kicker on a coordinated board. But I'm already committed with my tiny stack relative to the pot. I cannot fold since it's free to check. I should check and hope my hand holds up.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have top pair (Aces) with weak kicker on a coordinated board. With only 26 chips left in a 536 chip pot, I'm already pot-committed. Since it's free to check, I must see the showdown and hope my hand holds up against DeepSeek-V3.2's range.\"\n}",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in BB with Ah8d (top pair, Ace kicker)\n- Board: 9h As Td 3s\n- Pot: 536 chips\n- My stack: 26 chips (very short!)\n- Only opponent left: DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) with 386 chips\n- Action: It's checked to me on the turn\n- Legal actions: fold or check\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have top pair (Aces) with a decent kicker (8)\n- The board is somewhat coordinated but not too scary: 9h As Td 3s\n- No flush draw yet (only 2 spades)\n- Possible straight draws: QJ would have an open-ended straight draw, KQ would have gutshot\n- I have a strong hand given the board texture\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recalled actions, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been:\n- Checking and calling frequently\n- Making small bets on turn (72 and 32 chips in previous hands)\n- Folding preflop quite a bit\n- Seems fairly passive/trappy\n\n**Current Hand Context:**\n- Preflop: They raised to 160, I re-raised to 256, they called 96 more\n- Flop: I checked, they checked back\n- This suggests they might have something but not super strong, or they're trapping\n\n**My Situation:**\n- I only have 26 chips left (less than 0.5 BB!)\n- This is basically a \"push or fold\" situation\n- If I check, I'm giving a free card when I have a strong hand\n- I cannot bet because I don't have enough chips to meet the minimum raise (96 chips)\n\n**Tournament Consideration:**\n- With 26 chips, I'm critically short\n- Any hand I play should be all-in basically\n- Checking here is essentially giving up value with a strong hand\n- But I CANNOT bet because the minimum is 96 and I only have 26\n\nWait, let me re-read the legal actions: \"fold, check\"\n\nSo I cannot bet or raise - only check or fold. But checking with top pair and 26 chips seems weak. However, the rules say my legal actions are fold or check.\n\nActually, thinking about it more carefully: Since the amount to call is 0, I can check. But with 26 chips and top pair, I should want to get my money in. The issue is the minimum raise is 96, which I cannot meet.\n\nIn poker, if you have less than the minimum bet/raise amount, you can still go all-in. But it seems the system is restricting me to fold or check only.\n\nGiven I have a strong hand (top pair) and I'm extremely short-stacked, I should not fold. Checking seems like the only option, but I'm essentially playing for free when I should be trying to get value.\n\nLet me think if there's any scenario where checking is better:\n- If opponent is trapping with a monster (two pair, set, straight), then checking might save me\n- But with 26 chips left and 536 in the pot, I'm getting 20:1 immediate pot odds if I bet and get called\n\nActually, I realize I might be misunderstanding the rules. Let me reconsider: If the minimum raise is 96 and I only have 26, I should be able to go all-in for 26. But the system says my legal actions are fold or check.\n\nGiven the system constraints, I must choose between fold or check. With top pair Ace kicker on this board and being extremely short-stacked, folding would be terrible. Checking is the only viable option, even though I'd prefer to bet.\n\nLet me check my reasoning:\n1. Hand strength: Strong (top pair, Ace kicker)\n2. Position: BB (first to act on turn)\n3. Opponent: Passive, checked flop\n4. Stack: Critically short (26 chips)\n5. Legal actions: Fold or Check\n\nI cannot fold top pair with 26 chips left. Checking is the only option the system gives me.",

Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand (Hand #101 - RIVER):**\n- My position: BB (Seat 1)\n- My cards: Ah 8d\n- My stack: 26 chips (0.4 BB)\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 536 chips\n- Board: 9h As Td 3s 3d (pair of 3s on board, with an Ace)\n- Amount to call: 0\n- Legal actions: fold, check\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n1. **My hand strength**: I have Ah 8d. The board shows 9h As Td 3s 3d. This gives me two-pair: Aces and Threes (As Ah from my hand + 3s 3d from the board). However, note that the Ace is on the board, so anyone with an Ace has at least two-pair.\n\n2. **The action**: \n   - Preflop: Seat 3 raised to 160, I re-raised to 256 (all-in except 26 chips), Seat 3 called\n   - Flop: I checked, Seat 3 checked\n   - Turn: I checked, Seat 3 checked\n   - River: It's checked to me (amount to call is 0)\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**: The only remaining opponent is DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) with 386 chips. They raised preflop and called my re-raise, then checked both flop and turn. This could mean:\n   - They have a strong hand and are slow-playing\n   - They have a marginal hand and are scared of the Ace\n   - They have a draw that missed\n\n4. **My situation**: I only have 26 chips left (0.4 BB) and the pot is 536 chips. I'm getting 536:0 odds to check (infinite pot odds).\n\n**Decision**: I cannot raise because my stack is too small (minimum raise is 96 chips, but I only have 26). My options are check or fold. With two-pair (Aces and Threes), even though it's not the nuts, I have significant showdown value. Checking costs me nothing and gives me a chance to win the 536-chip pot. Folding would be giving up on a hand with good equity for no reason.\n\nI should check and go to showdown.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand, I'm on the BTN with 7c Js. I have 530 chips (8.3 BB) and blinds are 32/64. The pot is 96 and I need to call 32 more.\n\nMy hand is 7c Js - this is a marginal hand at best. It's not connected, not suited in a meaningful way, and the cards are low-medium.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak. J-7 offsuit is a folding hand in most situations.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button which is good position, but that doesn't make up for the weak hand.\n3. **Stack size**: I have 8.3 BB which is short stack territory. This is a critical tournament situation.\n4. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 is in the BB with 322 chips (about 5 BB). Looking at the opponent actions:\n   - They fold a lot preflop (hands 92, 94, 97, 98)\n   - They sometimes call/check (hands 95, 96, 99, 100)\n   - They occasionally raise (hand 101 - raised to 160)\n   - They seem to play somewhat passively post-flop with many checks\n\nGiven that I have a short stack (8.3 BB) and I'm facing a BB who also has a short stack (5 BB), and I have a terrible hand (J-7 offsuit), this is a clear fold. \n\nI cannot afford to call 32 chips (0.5 BB) with this hand. Even though I'm getting decent pot odds (calling 32 to win 96 - 3:1), the hand is just too weak and I need to preserve my chips for better spots, especially since I'm in short stack territory.\n\nWith 8.3 BB, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold. Calling with marginal hands is not optimal. I should wait for a better hand or a better situation (like when I'm in the BB/SB and can see a cheap flop).\n\nThe fact that DeepSeek-V3.2 has shown they can raise (hand 101) also suggests they might defend their BB, so I can't count on them folding to aggression.\n\n\nI'll conserve my tournament life by letting this hand go. The risk of losing more chips with such a weak holding outweighs any potential pot odds.",

I need to be very selective with my hands and look for spots to shove or fold.\n\n4. **Blinds**: 32/64 - The blinds are high relative to my stack.\n\n5. **Pot**: 96 chips - Already has the SB and BB posted.\n\n6. **Action**: I posted SB 32, DeepSeek-V3.2 posted BB 64.

With their short stack of 5 BB, they might be looking for a spot to get it in.\n\n**Decision analysis**:\n- With J5o and 8.3 BB, this is a clear fold in most tournament situations\n- I need to preserve my stack for better spots\n- Even though I'm on the button, J5o has very poor equity against any reasonable calling range\n- The opponent in BB is also short-stacked and might defend aggressively\n- The 32 chips I already posted as SB are sunk cost - I shouldn't throw good money after bad\n\n\n- The hand offers no compelling reasons to invest more chips, representing a classic low-equity situation that demands an immediate fold to protect my tournament life.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** K\u2660 4\u2660 - King-high with a suited connector, but very weak kicker\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - Best position\n**Stack:** 530 chips (8.3 BB) - Short stack, but not desperate yet\n**Blinds:** 32/64\n**Pot:** 96 chips\n**To Call:** 32 chips\n\n**Opponent:** DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB with 322 chips (5 BB)\n\nLooking at DeepSeek-V3.2's recent actions:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 97, 98, 103, 105)\n- When they do play, they tend to call rather than raise (hand 95, 100)\n- They made one big preflop raise in hand 101 (160 chips) which suggests they can be aggressive with strong hands\n- They check-fold on flops frequently when they do see them\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** K4s is marginal. It's suited but has a terrible kicker. From the button, this is a borderline hand.\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Stack Size:** I'm short-stacked at 8.3 BB. I need to be selective but also looking for spots to accumulate chips.\n4. **Opponent:** DeepSeek-V3.2 is also short at 5 BB and has been folding a lot preflop. This suggests they're playing tight.\n5. **Pot Odds:** I need to call 32 to win 96 (3:1 odds). With my hand, this is not great, but the position helps.\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I'm in a tournament with diminishing players. I need to preserve my stack but also can't wait forever.\n\n**Decision:** \n- Folding is too tight here. I'm on the button with a suited hand against a tight short-stacked opponent.\n- Calling is reasonable. I'm getting 3:1 odds, have position, and the opponent has shown they fold a lot.\n- Raising could be an option to try to take down the pot preflop, but with only 8.3 BB, I don't want to bloat the pot with a marginal hand.\n\nI think the best play is to **call**. The suited King has some playability, I'm in position, and the opponent has been tight. I can steal on many flops if they check to me. The 32 chip call represents only 6% of my stack, which is manageable.\n\nLet me reconsider - actually, with 8.3 BB, I should be more aggressive. A min-raise to 128 chips would be 24% of my stack, which is substantial. But it could fold out the BB who has been folding preflop a lot. However, if I get called, I'm in a tough spot with K4s.\n\nGiven the opponent's tightness (folding 4 of last 6 preflop opportunities), a raise could be profitable. But the risk is high with my marginal hand.\n\nI'll go with calling. It's the safer play that still allows me to use my position advantage without risking too much of my stack.",

It's a marginal hand, especially from the button.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (Button), which is the best position post-flop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 402 chips, which is 6.3 BB. This is a very short stack - I'm in the danger zone and need to make moves soon or I'll be blinded out.\n\n4. **Opponent**: Only DeepSeek-V3.2 in the BB with 450 chips (7 BB). Let me review their tendencies:\n   - They've been relatively tight, folding many preflop hands (hands 97, 98, 103, 105)\n   - They made a big raise in hand 106 (322 chips) and hand 107 (418 chips) - these look like all-in or near all-in moves\n   - In hand 101 they raised to 160 then called 96 more\n   - Their showdowns show they play a variety of hands: 88, J8s, Q4o, K9o, KJs\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 chips to win 96 chips - getting 3:1 odds. With my short stack, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold.\n\n6. **Tournament situation**: With 6.3 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. 6-5 offsuit is a marginal hand but on the button, it might be a spot to shove if the BB is tight.\n\nLooking at DeepSeek's pattern:\n- They fold to pressure often\n- They've made big raises in recent hands (106, 107) which suggests they might be playing aggressively\n- However, they also fold frequently preflop\n\nWith 6.3 BB, I should either:\n- Fold and wait for a better spot\n- Shove all-in to maximize fold equity\n\n6-5 offsuit is not a great hand, but:\n- I'm on the button\n- My stack is critically low\n- The BB has shown they can fold\n- I have fold equity\n \nI'm facing a critical tournament decision with a marginal hand. The 3:1 pot odds aren't compelling enough to justify a call with 6-5 offsuit. My short stack demands an aggressive approach, but this isn't the ideal spot. I'll fold and preserve my chips for a stronger hand that gives me better chances of doubling up. The risk of losing more chips outweighs the potential gain, especially with a hand that has limited post-flop playability.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The situation:\n- I'm in the BB (big blind) position\n- My cards: 3h 8h (offsuit, very weak hand)\n- My stack: 338 chips (5.3 BB)\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 128 chips\n- Players: Only Seat 3 (SB) and myself are active\n- SB posted 32, I posted 64\n- SB called 32 (so they put in 64 total, matching my BB)\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\nThis is a heads-up situation against the SB. I have 3h 8h, which is a terrible hand. However, I'm getting a free check option since the SB just called.\n\nLet me think about this:\n1. Hand strength: 3h 8h is very weak, offsuit, low cards, no connectivity\n2. Position: I'm in BB, which is out of position postflop\n3. Stack size: I have 338 chips (5.3 BB), which is short-stacked\n4. Opponent: Only one opponent (SB) who just called\n5. Pot odds: If I check, I get to see the flop for free\n\nGiven my short stack, I should be very selective with my hands. 3h 8h is not a hand I want to invest chips with. Even though I can check for free, playing this hand out of position with a weak holding is not advisable.\n\nHowever, checking is free and I get to see the flop. The risk is minimal since I'm not putting more chips in. But with such a weak hand, even if I hit something (like a pair of 3s or 8s), I'm likely dominated.\n\nLet me consider raising: \n- Minimum raise is to 128\n- If I raise, I'm investing more chips with a terrible hand\n- This would be a pure bluff\n- With my short stack, bluffing with 5.3 BB left is risky\n- The SB called preflop, so they likely have something\n\nThe best play here is to check and see the flop for free, then fold if I don't hit something very strong. \n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 3h 8h, even if I flop a pair, it's likely to be a weak pair. \n\nI'm extremely short-stacked at 5.3 big blinds. In this critical tournament situation, my options are severely limited. The hand's complete lack of potential makes any further investment unwise. Checking allows me to preserve my dwindling chips while taking a minimal risk. If the flop doesn't deliver an exceptional hand, immediate folding becomes the smartest strategic move to maintain any chance of tournament survival.",

I'm very short stacked with only 5.3 BB\n2. The board is Jd 2d Tc - there's a possible straight draw (Q-K for broadway), a flush draw (diamonds), and I have absolutely nothing (3-high)\n3. My opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 is in the SB and just called preflop\n4. From the memory recall, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been quite aggressive preflop (raising in hands 101, 106, 107) but also folds frequently\n\n**Tournament situation**: With 5.3 BB, I'm in critical territory. I need to preserve my stack or find good spots to get it in. This is NOT a good spot.\n\n**Hand analysis**: I have 3-high with no draw. The board has two diamonds (flush draw) and connected cards that could make straights. My opponent could easily have:\n- Any Jack (top pair)\n- Any Ten (second pair)\n- Any diamond draw\n- Straight draws\n- Or just two overs\n\n**Decision**: I should check and see the turn for free. I have no hand, no draw, and I'm out of position. Raising would be pure bluff with a short stack, which is not advisable. If I raise and get called, I'm committed with a terrible hand. If I check, I can:\n1. See a free card\n2. Potentially hit an 8 or 3 (though that's still likely not good)\n3. Fold to any aggression on the turn\n\nThis is a clear check situation.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 3h 8h - This is a very weak hand, no pair, no draw. I have a backdoor flush draw but that's very weak.\n\n**Board:** Jd 2d Tc - There are two diamonds on the board, so a flush draw is possible. The board also has connected cards (J-T) so straight draws are possible.\n\n**Situation:** \n- I'm in BB with 338 chips (5.3 BB)\n- Pot is 192 chips\n- Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 64 on the flop\n- I need to call 64 to see the turn\n\n**Pot odds:** 192 (pot) + 64 (bet) = 256 to win, need to call 64. So 256:64 or 4:1 odds.\n\n**My hand equity:** With 3-8 offsuit (hearts), I have essentially nothing. I might have a backdoor flush draw (need two more hearts), but that's very unlikely. I have no straight draw, no pair. I'm basically drawing dead.\n\n**Opponent analysis:** Looking at the opponent actions, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been playing somewhat aggressively. They made a big raise in hand 106 (322 chips) and hand 107 (418 chips - all-in). In hand 101 they raised to 160 preflop. They seem capable of making big bets.\n\nGiven my extremely weak hand (3-8 offsuit with no draw), the fact that I'm short-stacked (5.3 BB), and the opponent's bet, I should fold. I need to preserve my chips for better spots. Even with 4:1 pot odds, my hand is just too weak to continue. I have less than 10% chance of winning this hand, and I shouldn't waste 64 chips (about 12% of my stack) on such a weak draw.\n\nThe opponent's bet of 64 into a 192 pot is a 1/3 pot bet, which could be a value bet with a pair or better, or could be a continuation bet. Either way, my hand can't stand up to any pressure.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the Button (BTN) with A\u2660Q\u2665\n- My stack: 306 chips (4.8 BB) - very short!\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 96 chips\n- I need to call 32 to see the flop\n- I can raise to minimum 128\n- Only opponent: DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB with 546 chips\n\n**Key Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: A\u2660Q\u2665 is a very strong hand, especially in this situation. It's a premium hand.\n\n2. **Stack Size**: I'm extremely short-stacked at 4.8 BB. This is critical - I need to make a move soon or I'll be blinded out.\n\n3. **Opponent Analysis**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's recent actions:\n   - They folded preflop in hands 97, 98, 103, 105\n   - They called preflop in hand 100, 109\n   - They made large raises in hands 101 (160), 106 (322), 107 (418)\n   - They bet postflop in hands 96, 100, 109\n   \n   This suggests they play somewhat aggressively, especially with larger raises when they enter pots.\n\n4. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is the best position post-flop.\n\n5. **Tournament Situation**: With only 4.8 BB, I need to either shove or fold. Calling and leaving myself with ~4 BB is not optimal.\n\n6. **Decision**: With A\u2660Q\u2665 on the Button facing one opponent, this is a clear shove situation. My hand is strong enough to go all-in, and my stack size demands action.\n \nShoving directly aligns with optimal short-stack tournament strategy. The hand's strength combined with my dire chip situation makes an all-in move the most mathematically sound approach. This play maximizes fold equity and gives me the best chance to either win the pot immediately or get called by a potentially weaker hand.",

But at 5.3 BB, I'm in desperate need of a double-up.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully:\n- If I fold, I have 274 chips (4.3 BB) - still in push/fold territory\n- If I call, it's essentially for my tournament life\n- The opponent only has 32 chips, so they're the shortest stack at the table\n- A win would give me 14.3 BB, which is much more playable\n\nGiven that my opponent is extremely short (32 chips) and has shown aggression, I think they're shoving a wide range. Q8o is likely ahead of many random hands they could have. The pot odds are decent, and I desperately need chips.\n\nI think this is a call. I have to take a stand with my short stack, and the odds are reasonable against an opponent who could be shoving wide.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The opponent raised TO 514, not BY 514. They posted 32 as SB, then raised to 514. That means they added 482 chips on top of their 32. But they only have 32 chips total?

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the hand again:\n\n- I'm in BB with Q8 offsuit (8d Qc)\n- My stack: 338 chips (5.3 BB) - very short\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 578 chips\n- Opponent (Seat 3, DeepSeek-V3.2) posted SB 32, then raised to 514\n- I need to call 450 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call\n\nThe opponent has 32 chips total, so they must have gone all-in with their 32 chip SB post. The \"raise 514\" seems like it might be a display error or representing the total pot after my call.\n\nLet me think about this:\n- If opponent has 32 chips and posted SB, they're all-in for 32\n- The pot shows 578 total\n- I need to call 450\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. If opponent is all-in for 32, and I posted BB 64, the pot would be 96, not 578.\n\nLet me reconsider: Maybe the \"32 chips\" shown for Seat 3 is after posting the SB? Or maybe the chip counts are outdated?\n\nActually, I think the most logical interpretation is:\n- Opponent had 546 chips (32 + 514)\n- They posted SB of 32\n- Then they raised to 514 total (adding 482 more)\n- This would make them all-in\n- Pot would be: 32 (SB) + 64 (BB) + 514 (raise) = 610, but it shows 578\n\nHmm, still doesn't match perfectly. Let me go with the information given:\n- Pot is 578\n- I need to call 450\n- That means there's 128 in the pot already (578 - 450)\n- 128 would be 32 (SB) + 64 (BB) + 32 (some other amount)\n\nI think the most reasonable interpretation is that the opponent raised by 450 (to 514 total), and the pot calculation includes some existing money.\n \nI'm analyzing the tournament situation with an extremely short stack of 5.3 big blinds. With Q8 offsuit, I'm facing a crucial decision. The pot odds are 1.28 to 1, meaning I need around 44% equity to justify a call. My opponent's aggressive shove suggests a wide range, potentially giving me 45-50% equity with my current hand. \n\nThe tournament implications are significant. Folding leaves me with a precarious 4.3 big blinds, while calling puts my tournament life at risk. A successful call would double my stack to 14.3 big blinds, dramatically improving my competitive position. Given the aggressive opponent and reasonable pot odds, this appears to be a favorable spot to take a calculated risk and potentially double my stack.\n\nThe decision ultimately comes down to leveraging my short-stack advantage against an opponent likely making a desperate move. The potential reward of doubling my chips outweighs the risk of elimination in this scenario.",

If I hit a K on the flop, I'll often be out-kicked. The flush potential is nice but not enough to justify playing this from early position.\n\n2. **Position disadvantage**: Being UTG means I'll have 4-5 players acting after me. Many hands dominate K6s (any better Kx, any pocket pair, any two Broadway cards).\n\n3. **Tournament considerations**: It's early in the tournament (Hand #2). No need to take marginal spots. Better to preserve chips for better opportunities.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: 2 chips to win 3 chips (1.5:1) - not compelling enough to call with a marginal hand.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold.

I have 5 opponents yet to act behind me. In early position, I need to play very tight.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 200 chips (100 BB), which is a healthy stack. No immediate pressure.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: It's early in the tournament (hand #3). I should be playing relatively tight and preserving my stack.\n\n5. **Standard play**: From UTG, the standard opening range is very tight - typically only premium hands like high pairs (JJ+, QQ, KK, AA), AK, AQ, and sometimes AJ suited. J-7 offsuit is nowhere near this range.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 2 to win 3, which is 1.5:1. While the pot odds are decent, this is irrelevant with such a weak hand from early position.\n\n7. **Future considerations**: If I call, I could face raises from multiple opponents behind me. Even if I see the flop, I'll be out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\nThe clear correct play here is to fold.

They did raise once (Hand 2) but then folded, suggesting they might be cautious or only raising with strong hands.\n\n**Hand Strength Analysis:**\n- K6 offsuit is a marginal hand\n- King is decent but kicker is very weak (6)\n- Not suited, so no flush potential\n- Some straight potential but very weak\n\n**Position Analysis:**\n- On the Button, I'm in the best position post-flop\n- Everyone folded to me, so it's just me vs the BB\n- I have position advantage throughout the hand\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: Marginal at best\n2. **Position**: Excellent (on the button)\n3. **Opponent**: Seems tight, likely to fold to pressure\n4. **Pot odds**: Need to call 1 to win 3 (3:1 odds)\n5. **Stack sizes**: Deep stacked (100 BB effective)\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Too tight from the button with only BB left\n2. **Call (1 chip)**: Cheap to see flop in position. Good pot odds (3:1). If I hit a King, I can likely get value. If I miss, I can easily fold.\n3. **Raise**: Could steal from tight opponent. Min raise is 4 chips. Could make it 5-6 chips total.\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm on the button\n- It's only 1 chip to call (0.5% of my stack)\n- Pot odds are good (3:1)\n- I have position throughout\n- Opponent seems tight and may fold to aggression\n- K6o has some playability, especially if I hit a King\n\nI think the best play is to **call**. Raising could work as a steal, but K6o is too weak to raise for value, and I don't need to steal from the BB when I have position. Calling is cheap and allows me to see the flop with good odds.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Since the opponent has folded 3 out of 4 times preflop, they might be tight enough that a raise could steal the blinds. However, the min raise is 4 chips, and if called, I'd be out of position with a marginal hand. \n\nThe conservative but correct play is to **call** and see a cheap flop in position.",

No value in betting with this weak hand.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand:\n\n**My hand**: 6h Kd - King-high with a 6 kicker. This is not a strong hand.\n\n**Board**: 8d 2s 5s - There's a possible straight draw (3-4-6-7) but I don't have that. I have a gutshot straight draw if a 4 comes (4-5-6-7-8). There's also a flush draw with three spades on board.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button, which is good position.\n\n**Pot**: 4 chips\n\n**Action**: It's checked to me. I can check or raise.\n\n**Opponent**: Seat 2 is the BB. Looking at their history:\n- Hand 1: preflop fold\n- Hand 2: preflop raise to 6, then fold (so they raised but got called and folded)\n- Hand 3: preflop fold\n- Hand 4: preflop fold\n\nSo Seat 2 has been quite tight, folding 3 out of 4 hands preflop. In Hand 2 they raised but then folded, suggesting they can make continuation bets but will fold to resistance.\n\n**My hand analysis**: \n- I have King-high, which might be good if my opponent has nothing\n- I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 4)\n- The board has 3 spades, so a flush draw is possible (but I don't have a spade)\n- My hand is weak overall\n\n**Decision**: I think checking is the best option here. My hand is weak, I only have a gutshot draw and King-high. The opponent is tight and checked to me. There's no value in betting here - I can't get called by worse hands often enough. If I bet and get called, I'm likely behind. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to see a free turn card that might improve my hand (a King would give me top pair, a 4 would give me a straight).\n\nI could consider a small bluff bet since I have position and the opponent is tight, but it's not necessary with this weak hand. Let me just check and see the turn.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. \n\nI have a gutshot straight draw and King-high. The opponent checked to me. A small bet could be a good play here for a few reasons:\n1. I have position\n2. Opponent is tight and likely missed this board\n3. I can represent a strong hand\n4. I have some equity with the gutshot\n\nBut checking is also fine - it keeps the pot small and lets me realize my equity for free.\n\nActually, I think checking is better. My hand is too weak to value bet, and while I could bluff, there's no need to risk chips here. Let me check and see the turn.\n\nActually wait - let me think about this more carefully. The pot is 4 chips. If I bet 2 chips (minimum raise to 2, but that means total bet of 2), I could potentially win the pot right now. The opponent is tight and has shown they can fold. The board is somewhat scary with 3 spades.\n\nBut I don't have a spade, so if a spade comes on the turn, I'll be in a tough spot.\n\nI think the best play is to check. My hand is weak, I have some equity with the gutshot, and I can see a free card. No need to build a pot with King-high.\n\nLet me check.",

This suggests they likely have a weak hand.\n\n**My hand:** K-high is actually decent in a heads-up pot where both players have shown weakness. I have 6 outs to a pair (3 Kings, 3 sixes), though some might not be clean outs if opponent has a better kicker.\n\n**Position:** I'm on the button, which is advantageous.\n\n**Pot odds:** If I bet 2 (minimum raise), I'm risking 2 to win 4, so I need 33% equity. If opponent folds even 50% of the time, this is profitable.\n\nGiven that:\n1. Opponent has shown weakness (checked twice)\n2. I have position\n3. I have some equity with K-high\n4. A small bet could take down the pot\n5. Opponent is tight based on history\n\nI should make a small value bet/probe bet to try to take down the pot now. This is a good spot to represent strength and capitalize on opponent's passivity.\n\nMinimum raise is to 2 chips total.

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent in Seat 2 (Kimi-K2) has been mostly folding preflop in the previous hands. In Hand #2 they raised preflop but then folded when facing action. They seem to be playing fairly tight and straightforward.\n\nNow on the turn:\n- I have Kd6h - a weak hand with just king-high\n- Board: 8d 2s 5s Jh - there's a flush draw on board (spades) and a straight draw possibility\n- I bet 2 on the turn and got raised to 8 (a min-raise of 6 more to call)\n- Pot is now 14 + my 2 + their 8 = 24 chips\n- I need to call 6 to see the river\n\nLet me think about this:\n1. My hand strength: I have K-high with no pair, no draw. My king might be good if opponent has nothing, but the raise suggests they have something.\n2. Position: I'm on the button which is good position.\n3. Opponent: Based on their history, they're not super aggressive. They raise with real hands.\n4. Pot odds: I need to call 6 to win 24, so 4:1 odds. That's decent, but I have no real equity.\n5. The board has draws that could have hit or could complete on river.\n\nThe opponent check-called preflop (they checked as BB and I just called as SB), then checked the flop. Now on the turn they raise after I bet. This is a strong move from a normally tight player. They could have:\n- A made hand: any pair (Jx, 8x, 5x, 2x), two pair, set\n- A draw: spade flush draw, straight draw (6-7, 7-9, etc.)\n\nWith my K-high, I'm likely behind. Even if they have a flush draw, I don't have a spade to block it. The raise size is small (min-raise), which might sometimes be a draw, but from a tight player it's more likely a made hand.\n\nI should probably fold here. I have no equity, no draw, and I'm facing aggression from a tight player. The pot odds aren't good enough to justify a call with just king-high.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The pot is 14, I bet 2, they raised to 8. So the pot is actually: initial 14 + my 2 + their 8 = 24. I need to call 6 more. So pot odds are 24:6 or 4:1.\n\nBut I have NO outs. Even if I hit a king, it might not be good. And if they have a flush draw, they have 9 outs. If they have a pair, I have 6 outs (3 kings, 3 sixes). But many of those outs might not be clean.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight nature and the fact that they're raising on the turn after showing weakness earlier, I think this is a fold.",

It's offsuit, disconnected, and low. This is definitely a folding hand in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is great position, but even position can't make up for such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3, so 2:3 odds or 40% equity needed. I definitely don't have this with 48o.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: \n   - SB has shown willingness to raise preflop\n   - BB has made larger preflop raises and seems to play a somewhat wide range (showed JQ)\n\n5. **Tournament Considerations**: \n   - I have a healthy stack (98.5 BB)\n   - No need to get involved with marginal hands\n   - Preserve chips for better spots\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a clear fold. 48 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker. Even with good position and relatively cheap entry (only 2 chips), it's not worth playing. I should wait for a better spot.\n\nThe only scenario where I might consider playing this is if both opponents were extremely tight and I could steal the blinds frequently, but based on the action I've seen (they've both raised preflop before), I don't have that read yet.",

This keeps the pot small and allows me to use my positional advantage postflop.\n\nHowever, I could also consider a **raise** to 15-18 chips to:\n1. Isolate the raiser\n2. Take control of the hand\n3. Potentially win preflop if they're weak\n\nBut given the opponent's tight raising pattern, a call seems safer. Let me go with the call to see the flop in position.",

Let's analyze:\n\n**Hand details:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: Js Ks (King-Jack suited, spades)\n- Stack: 191 chips (95.5 BB)\n- Board: Qs 9s 8h (Queen, nine, eight with two spades)\n- Pot: 19 chips\n- Opponent: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) with 194 chips\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Flop: Qs 9s 8h\n- Opponent bet: 4 chips (small bet into 19 chip pot)\n- Amount to call: 4 chips\n- We have a very strong draw: King-high flush draw + gutshot straight draw\n\n**Hand strength analysis:**\n- We have Ks Js - two spades on a board with two spades (Qs 9s)\n- This gives us a King-high flush draw (nut flush draw if we hit the spade, since Ace of spades would beat us)\n- We also have a gutshot straight draw: 10 would give us a straight (K-Q-J-10-9)\n- So we have 9 spade outs for the flush + 4 ten outs for the straight = 13 outs total\n- However, note that the Ts is both a spade AND completes our straight, so we need to be careful not to double count\n- Actually: Spade outs: As, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, Ts, Js, Ks (but we have Js Ks) = 9 spades total, we have 2, so 7 remaining spades\n- Straight outs: Ts (any suit) = 4 tens total\n- But Ts is already counted in spade outs, so total outs = 7 spades + 3 non-spade tens = 10 outs\n- Wait, let me recount: Board is Qs 9s 8h\n- Our cards: Ks Js\n- Flush outs: Any spade except Qs, 9s, Js, Ks = As, 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, 6s, 7s, Ts, 8s = 9 spade outs\n- Straight outs: Any ten gives us K-Q-J-10-9 straight = Ts, Tc, Td, Th = 4 ten outs\n- But Ts is already counted in spade outs, so total unique outs = 9 + 3 = 12 outs\n- Actually, let me be more precise: \n  - Flush draw: 9 spades in the deck, 2 on board, 2 in our hand = 5 spades accounted for, so 8 spades remaining (13 total - 5 accounted for = 8)\n  - Straight draw: We need a ten. There are 4 tens in the deck.\n  - Total outs = 8 spades + 4 tens = 12 outs, but the Ts is counted twice, so 11 unique outs\n- Wait, let's do this properly:\n  - Total cards: 52\n  - Known cards: 2 in our hand + 3 on board = 5 cards\n  - Unknown cards: 47\n  - Spades: 13 total.

There are 4 tens in the deck.\n  - Total outs = 8 spades + 4 tens = 12 outs, but the Ts is counted twice, so 11 unique outs\n- Wait, let's do this properly:\n  - Total cards: 52\n  - Known cards: 2 in our hand + 3 on board = 5 cards\n  - Unknown cards: 47\n  - Spades: 13 total. We know Qs, 9s, Ks, Js = 4 spades accounted for. So 9 spades remaining.\n  - Tens: 4 total. None on board or in our hand. So 4 tens remaining.\n  - Ts is in both categories, so total outs = 9 + 4 - 1 = 12 outs\n- Actually, the Ts is just one card that serves both purposes.

Let me analyze:\n\n**GPT-OSS-120B's tendencies:**\n- Hand 1: Raised preflop, bet flop (2 into 9), bet turn (8) - took aggressive line\n- Hand 2: Folded preflop\n- Hand 3: Folded preflop when facing raise and call\n- Hand 4: Folded preflop\n- Hand 5: Folded preflop\n- Hand 6: Folded preflop\n\nSo GPT-OSS-120B has been quite tight, folding preflop 5 out of 6 times. When they did enter the pot (Hand 1), they played aggressively postflop.\n\nIn the current hand (Hand 7), they raised preflop to 6, and now bet 4 on the flop into a 19 chip pot. This is a small bet (21% pot).\n\n**My hand:** Js Ks - I have a strong combo draw:\n- Flush draw (King-high)\n- Gutshot straight draw (need a Ten)\n- Backdoor straight possibilities\n\n**Pot odds:** 4 to call into 23 total = 17.4% needed equity\n**My equity:** ~12 outs = ~24% on the turn, ~48% by river\n\nEven against a strong hand like top pair, I have good equity. The opponent's small bet suggests either:\n1. Weak hand trying to see where they stand\n2. Strong hand trying to extract value\n3. Drawing hand themselves\n\nGiven their tight preflop play but aggressive postflop in Hand 1, I should raise here to:\n1. Build the pot when I have strong equity\n2. Charge them for drawing\n3. Potentially take it down now\n4. Gain initiative\n\nI should raise to about 14-16 chips (roughly 3-4x their bet). Let's make it 15 total.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation step by step:\n\n**Current Hand Situation:**\n- My position: BTN (Button)\n- My cards: Js Ks (King-Jack suited, spades)\n- My stack: 176 chips (88 BB)\n- Board: Qs 9s 8h 2d\n- Pot: 45 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have a flush draw (spades) with Ks Js\n- I have an open-ended straight draw (any Ten gives me a straight)\n- I have two overcards (K and J)\n- This gives me a very strong drawing hand with many outs\n\n**Outs calculation:**\n- Flush draw: 9 spades remaining (13 total - 4 on board/in hand)\n- Straight draw: 4 Tens (but Ts is already counted in flush draw, so 3 additional)\n- Overcards: 3 Kings + 3 Jacks = 6 outs (but some may be blocked by flush/straight cards)\n- Total clean outs: ~15 outs (9 flush + 3 straight + some overcard outs)\n\nThis is approximately a 30-32% chance to hit on the river.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 45 chips\n- To call: 0 (opponent checked)\n- If I bet, minimum raise is to 11\n\n**Opponent analysis:**\n- Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's history:\n  - Hand 1: Raised preflop, bet flop and turn, folded to turn bet\n  - Hand 2: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 3: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 4: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 5: Folded preflop\n  - Hand 6: Folded preflop\n\nGPT-OSS-120B seems to be playing tight but also betting when they have initiative. They raised preflop to 6, bet 4 on flop, called my raise to 15, and now checked on turn.\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Preflop: GPT-OSS-120B raised to 6, I called\n- Flop: GPT-OSS-120B bet 4, I raised to 15, they called\n- Turn: They checked\n\nThe check on turn after calling my flop raise suggests they might be:\n1. Weak and giving up\n2. Pot-controlling with a marginal hand\n3. Setting a trap with a strong hand\n\nGiven the board texture Qs 9s 8h 2d, possible hands they could have:\n- Made hands: Qx, 9x, 8x, 22, 99, QQ\n- Draws: Spade flush draws, straight draws (JT, T7, 76)\n- Air: Various hands that missed\n\n**My options:**\n1. Check: See a free river card with my strong draw\n2. Bet: Build the pot when I hit, fold out some better hands, charge draws\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack of 88 BB\n- Pot is already 45 chips\n- Building the pot now could win me a big pot if I hit\n\n**Decision:**\nWith such a strong draw (flush + straight + overcards), I should bet for value and to build the pot. Checking would give a free card but I'd miss value when I hit. \n\nSince opponent checked, I can make a value bet with my draw. A bet of around 20-25 chips (half pot) would be appropriate to:\n- Charge draws\n- Build pot for when I hit\n- Potentially fold out marginal hands\n\nMinimum raise is 11, but I should bet more than that. Let me bet 22 chips (roughly half pot).",

History shows they call preflop sometimes and make small bets on flop/river. They folded many preflop hands. They seem somewhat passive.\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Just bet 4 chips. History shows they were very tight (folded first 3 hands), then in hand 7 they raised preflop, bet flop, called a raise, then folded on turn. They seem capable of bluffing or betting with marginal hands, but also folding when faced with resistance.\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 10, I need to call 4\n- Getting 2.5:1 odds\n- I need 28.6% equity to call\n\n**Equity analysis:**\nWith 3-high on a 2-4-9 board, I likely have very low equity. Even against a pure bluff, my 3-high might not be good. I'm probably drawing to runner-runner straight or two pair/trips, which is very unlikely.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. I have no hand, no draw, and while the pot odds aren't terrible, I have almost no chance of winning this hand. My stack is healthy at 109.5 BB, so there's no need to chase with such a weak hand. I should preserve my chips for better spots.\n\nEven if both opponents are bluffing, my 3-high is very unlikely to be the best hand. The bet from Seat 5 suggests some strength, and I have no information about Seat 4's intentions yet.",

It's not premium but playable in position.\n2. **Position**: Button is the best position - I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: I don't have any specific reads yet, but I should raise to isolate the BB.\n4. **Pot odds**: Very good - only 1 to call to win 3.\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With a healthy stack, I should be looking to accumulate chips.\n\n**Decision**: I should raise to isolate the big blind and take control of the hand. A standard raise would be 3x-4x the BB, so 6-8 chips. The minimum is 4, but that's too small. I'll raise to 6 or 7 to make it a proper raise.\n\nLet me make a standard button raise:\n- Raise to 6 or 7 chips (3x-3.5x BB)\n- This pressures the BB and gives me initiative\n\nI'll raise to 6 chips.",

Folded preflop in 7 of last 10 hands. Only raised once (hand 6) and made one turn raise (hand 5). Seems to play very few hands.\n- **DeepSeek-V3.2 (BB)**: Also very tight! Folded preflop in 6 of last 10 hands. Only played hand 3 where they called down with JQ suited on an A-high board.\n\nGiven this information:\n1. **Hand strength**: 6s 4d is trash. Very low suitedness, low connectivity, low card ranks. This is a fold 99% of the time.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN which is great, but not enough to justify playing this hand.\n3. **Opponents**: Both opponents are extremely tight based on recent history. This means:\n   - If I raise, they're likely to fold often (good for stealing)\n   - But if they call/raise, they're likely to have strong hands\n4. **Stack size**: I have a healthy stack, no need to take risks with trash hands\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3 (1.5:1) which is not enough for this hand\n\nThe only argument for playing this hand would be as a steal attempt given how tight both opponents are. However:\n- I have 110 BB, no need to steal with trash\n- If either opponent defends, I'll be out of position postflop with a terrible hand\n- The risk/reward isn't worth it with this hand strength\n\n\nThe situation calls for a conservative approach. Folding is the most prudent action, protecting my stack and avoiding unnecessary risk with a weak hand against tight opponents.",

It's dominated by any other King with a better kicker, and the 5 doesn't help much.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG, the worst position preflop. I have 7 players left to act behind me, increasing the chance someone has a strong hand.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3, SB): Very tight, folded 7 hands in a row preflop. Only played hand #3 with Jd Qd. This suggests they only play premium hands.\n   - MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4, BB): Also relatively tight, but has defended BB a couple times. Called in hand #8 and #9, but folded to aggression.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack of 110.5 BB. No need to take marginal spots from early position.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Need to call 2 to win 3 (1.5:1), which is not relevant here since my hand is too weak.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. K5o from UTG is a trash hand. I could be dominated by any Kx hand, and I'm out of position against 7 opponents. Even if I hit a King on the flop, I'll be in tough spots with such a weak kicker. The best play is to fold and wait for a better spot, especially given my healthy stack size.\n\nI don't need to search for more information - this is a straightforward fold based on basic poker fundamentals.",

When they do call, they often bet on flop (seen in hand 8). Seems like a tight-passive player.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Also mostly folding preflop (folded 6/9 times), but when they enter pots, they can be aggressive (bet 4 on flop in hand 9). The raise from SB suggests strength.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- J2o is a very weak hand, even with a diamond (not suited)\n- I'm out of position as BB\n- Facing a raise from SB who has been relatively tight\n- Pot odds: 6 to win 18 (12+6) = 3:1 or 25% equity needed\n- J2o has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. J2o is one of the worst hands in poker, I'm out of position, facing aggression from a player who appears tight, and I have no implied odds. Even with good pot odds, my hand is just too weak to continue.\n\nI should fold.",

King-high but very weak kicker.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in SB (small blind), which is out of position for the rest of the hand.\n\n3. **Stack**: 221 chips (110.5 BB) - Healthy stack.\n\n4. **Action**: Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) raised to 6 from late position (seat 5 with 5 players). The pot is 9 chips, I need to call 5 more.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n   - Hand 14: Raised preflop (amount 8)\n   - Hands 13, 12, 11, 10: Folded preflop\n   - Hand 9: Called preflop, then bet on flop\n   - Hand 8: Checked preflop, folded on flop\n   - Hand 7: Folded on turn\n\n   So they raise occasionally (hand 14 and now hand 15), but fold a lot. Their raise in hand 14 was for 8 chips, now they're raising to 6. This seems like a standard opening raise from late position.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 5 to win 9, so about 1.8:1 pot odds, which is roughly 36% equity needed.\n\n7. **Hand equity**: K4o has about 40-45% equity against a random hand, but against a raising range from late position, it's likely much worse - probably around 30-35% equity against a typical raising range.\n\n8. **Position disadvantage**: I'll be out of position post-flop, which makes it harder to realize my equity.\n\n9. **Tournament considerations**: I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots like this. The opponent seems to be raising with some frequency but also folding a lot. \n\nThe raise to 6 suggests they have a real hand. Given my weak K4o, out of position, and the fact that I need to hit something specific (like a king with a good kicker, or trips) to continue, this is an easy fold.\n\nLet me fold here.",

Has folded 9 out of 10 recent hands preflop. Only reached showdown once with JdQd.\n\n2. **My situation:**\n   - Position: BTN (best position)\n   - Hand: 9d Qh (Q9 offsuit) - marginal hand\n   - Stack: 221 chips (110.5 BB) - healthy stack\n   - To call: 2 chips (1 BB)\n\n3. **Tournament considerations:**\n   - I have a healthy stack, no need to take unnecessary risks\n   - Both opponents are extremely tight, suggesting they're waiting for premium hands\n   - I'm on the button, which gives me position advantage\n\n4. **Hand analysis:**\n   - Q9 offsuit is not a strong hand, but it's playable from the button against tight players\n   - Against two very tight opponents who fold frequently, this is a good spot to steal the blinds\n   - The tight players are likely to fold unless they have premium holdings\n\nGiven that both opponents fold very frequently (especially DeepSeek-V3.2 who has folded 90% of recent hands), and I'm on the button with position advantage, this is a perfect spot for a steal attempt. A standard raise of 3x the big blind (6 chips) should be sufficient to take down the pot most of the time.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider the raise sizing. The minimum raise is to 4 chips (2x BB), but a 3x BB raise (6 chips) is more standard for a steal attempt and gives better fold equity.\n\nActually, looking at the pot: blinds are 1/2, so pot is 3 chips. A raise to 6 chips (3x BB) is standard. Let me raise to 6 chips total.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- My cards: 9d Qh - I have a gutshot straight draw (need a 10 to make a straight)\n- Stack: 215 chips (107.5 BB) - healthy stack\n- Board: 5s Kc Js - There's a King and Jack on board\n- Pot: 18 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nI have Q9 with a board showing K-J-5. This gives me:\n- No pair\n- Gutshot straight draw (need a Ten to make a straight from 9-10-J-Q-K)\n- Backdoor flush draw (two diamonds, but board has one spade and two clubs)\n\n**Opponent Actions:**\n- Preflop: I raised to 6, both opponents called\n- Flop: Both opponents checked to me\n\nThis is a good situation for a continuation bet (c-bet). Let me think about what my opponents might have:\n\n**Opponent Ranges:**\nGiven they called preflop from SB and BB:\n- SB (Seat 2): Could have broadway cards, suited connectors, pocket pairs, etc.\n- BB (Seat 3): Could have a wide range since they got good odds to call\n\nThe K-J board hits a lot of calling ranges. However, the fact that both checked to me suggests weakness. They could have:\n- Hands that missed completely\n- Weak pairs (like 5x, maybe Jx)\n- Draws\n- Strong hands slowplaying (less likely with two players)\n\n**My Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card, see if I hit my gutshot. But this gives up initiative and allows opponents to realize equity for free.\n2. **Raise (c-bet)**: Apply pressure, take down the pot now, or build pot if I hit my draw.\n \nWith a gutshot draw and two opponents, checking seems like the most prudent move. The limited outs (only 4 Tens) and potential for opponents to have strong hands make a continuation bet risky. Checking allows me to see the next card without investing more chips, preserving my stack and avoiding unnecessary confrontation.\n\nI'll carefully consider the potential risks of betting against two opponents on this board texture. The presence of high cards like King and Jack means opponents could easily have connected hands. Checking provides a strategic way to control the pot size and manage my chip stack effectively.\n\nMy position on the button gives me flexibility, and the free card option looks most attractive with my current drawing hand. I'll take the conservative approach and check, maintaining my strategic options for future streets.",

This is a weak draw.\n\n**Board**: 5s Kc Js 2c\n- There are potential flush draws (clubs)\n- There are potential straight draws (QT would give me a straight, but I only have Q9)\n- The K and J are high cards that could connect with many hands\n\n**Position**: I'm on the BTN (button), which is good position.\n\n**Action**:\n- Preflop: I raised to 6, both opponents called\n- Flop: Everyone checked (5s Kc Js)\n- Turn: Seat 2 checked, Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 14\n\n**Pot**: 32 chips\n**To call**: 14 chips\n**Pot odds**: 32:14 or approximately 2.3:1\n\n**Opponent info**: DeepSeek-V3.2 has been very tight - folding preflop in most hands. They only played hands #1, #2, and #3. In hand #1 they folded on the turn. In hand #2 they raised preflop big (18 chips). In hand #3 they saw showdown after calling down.\n\nThe fact that this tight player is now betting on the turn after everyone checked the flop suggests they likely have a strong hand. They could have:\n- A King (Kx)\n- A Jack (Jx)\n- A flush draw with clubs\n- A straight draw (QT)\n- Two pair or a set\n\n**My equity**: With just a gutshot straight draw (need a 10), I have approximately 4 outs (four 10s in the deck), which is about 8.7% equity on the turn. This is not enough to call 14 chips into a 32 chip pot.\n\nEven if I factor in implied odds, it's unlikely I'll get paid off enough if I hit my gutshot, especially against a tight player who likely has a strong hand.\n\n**Decision**: Fold. I don't have the pot odds to chase this gutshot, and I'm against a tight player who is showing strength. \n\nThe pot odds are 2.3:1, but my draw needs roughly 10:1 to be profitable. My stack of 215 chips is deep enough to wait for better spots. The opponent's tight betting pattern indicates genuine strength, making a call or raise unwise with my weak draw.",

K5o from UTG is one of the worst hands you could have in the worst position. The king is dominated by any hand with a better kicker (K6+, AK, KQ, KJ, KT), and the 5 gives you almost no additional value.\n\nThe correct play is to fold and wait for a better hand in a better position.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this preflop situation:\n\n**My cards**: Ks6s (King of spades, 6 of spades)\n**My position**: BB (Big Blind)\n**My stack**: 213 chips (106.5 BB)\n**Pot**: 6 chips\n**Amount to call**: 0 (I can check for free)\n**Legal actions**: fold, check, raise\n\n**Current situation**:\n- Seat 5 (SB) posted 1 chip and called 1 more (now has 2 in pot)\n- Seat 4 called 2 chips\n- I'm in BB and have already posted 2 chips\n\nSo the action is on me to check or raise. The pot is 6 chips (2 from me + 2 from Seat 4 + 2 from Seat 5).\n\n**Analysis of opponents**:\n\n**Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2)**:\n- Very tight player - has folded preflop many times (hands 4,5,6,7,10,11,13,15,16,17,18)\n- Only calls occasionally (hands 8,9,14)\n- When they do call, they often bet on flop (hand 8) but can fold on flop (hand 9)\n- Showed down Ad8h in hand 3, which is a decent but not premium hand\n- Seems to be a straightforward, tight player\n\n**Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B)**:\n- More active player - has made raises in hands 14 and 15\n- In hand 15, they raised preflop to 6 and then bet 30 on flop (big bet)\n- Also calls sometimes (hands 7,9,18)\n- Can be aggressive postflop (bet in hand 7,9)\n- Seems more aggressive/tricky than Seat 4\n\n**Hand analysis**:\nKs6s is a marginal hand. It's suited, which gives some flush potential, but the kicker is weak. King-high can be dominated by better kings.\n\n**Position**: I'm in BB, which is good position postflop (I'll act last on all streets).\n\n**Pot odds**: I can check for free and see a flop, getting 6:0 pot odds (infinite). Checking is clearly +EV since I have no additional investment.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: With 106.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. No need to take unnecessary risks.\n\n**Decision**:\n- Checking is the standard play here. I get to see a flop for free with a marginal suited hand.\n- Raising would be a bluff/semi-bluff. With two callers, a raise would need to be to at least 8-12 chips. This would be risky with K6s.\n- The opponents have different styles - Seat 4 is tight, Seat 5 is more aggressive. Checking allows me to see how they act postflop and gather more information.\n\nI should check and see the flop. This is a clear check situation with a marginal hand and no investment needed.",

The only value here is the suited connector potential, but the gap is large and the cards are low. In position (on the button) I could consider stealing the blinds, but given that:\n\n1. My hand is extremely weak (J2s is a fold in most situations)\n2. I'm on the button with only the BB to act\n3. The BB has been folding a lot recently (3 consecutive preflop folds)\n4. However, I only need to call 1 chip to see a flop (pot odds of 4:1)\n5. My stack is healthy at 109 BB\n\nEven with good pot odds (calling 1 to win 4), J2s is just too weak. The reverse implied odds are poor - if I hit a J, I'm often dominated by better Jx hands. If I hit a flush, it's a low flush that could be beaten by higher flushes. The straight possibilities are minimal with this gap.\n\nGiven the opponent's tight tendency and my weak hand, I should:\n- Fold: The safe play, preserving my chips for better spots\n- Call: Could be justified given pot odds and position, but very marginal\n- Raise: Would be a steal attempt, but unnecessary risk with this hand\n\nI think folding is the correct play here. While I have position and the opponent has been folding, J2s is just too weak to play even in this spot. I should preserve my chips for better hands.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The search didn't return specific results, so I need to make a decision based on the current situation.\n\nLet me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Q2s (Q\u26652\u2660) is a very weak hand. The queen is decent but the kicker is terrible (2). It's offsuit, so no flush potential. This is typically a fold.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position. However, this doesn't compensate for the hand weakness.\n\n3. **Action**: There's already been a raise to 16 (Seat 4) and a 3-bet to 28 (Seat 5). I need to call 28 chips to see the flop.\n\n4. **Stack size**: I have 218 chips (54.5 BB). Calling 28 chips would be about 13% of my stack. If I call and miss, I'm giving up significant chips.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 50 chips (blinds + raises). I need to call 28, so pot odds are 50:28 or about 1.79:1. This is not great odds for a speculative hand.\n\n6. **Opponent ranges**: Seat 4's initial raise and Seat 5's 3-bet suggest strong ranges. Seat 5 is showing significant strength with the 3-bet.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 54.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving my stack for better opportunities is more valuable than trying to hit a miracle flop with Q2o.\n\nEven though I'm on the Button, Q2o is simply too weak to call a 3-bet. The hand has very poor equity against the likely strong ranges of my opponents. I should fold and wait for a better spot.",

The hand is too weak to play from early position, I'll be out of position post-flop, and I don't want to risk chips with a marginal hand when I have a decent stack.

It's dominated by many better aces (AK, AQ, AJ, AT, A9, A8, A7) and has poor playability post-flop.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be acting first on every street with 4 players behind me.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 218 chips (54.5 BB), which is a decent stack but not deep enough to make speculative plays from early position.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: From UTG, I should be playing a very tight range. A6o is not in a standard UTG opening range.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to win 6. That's 4:6 or 1:1.5 odds, which isn't relevant here since my hand is too weak.\n\nEven though I should be tight from UTG, let me think about whether a raise could make sense:\n- If I raise, I'd be raising to at least 8 chips (2x BB)\n- With A6o, I'd be building a pot with a weak hand out of position\n- I'm likely to get called by better hands and be dominated\n- The only advantage is I have an ace blocker, but that's not enough\n\nThe correct play here is clearly to **fold**. I don't need to use the memory tools for this straightforward decision - it's a fundamental poker strategy play.\n\nLet me format the response correctly:",

I don't need to put any more chips in to see the flop.\n\n7. **Strategy**: With 2h 4d, this is a very weak hand. I should:\n   - Check and see a free flop\n   - There's no value in raising with this hand\n   - Folding would be giving up my BB for no reason when I can check for free\n\nI should check here.

My hand is very weak - bottom pair with bad kicker\n2. I'm out of position\n3. MiniMax-M2 is tight and only calls preflop with strong hands\n4. The board is dangerous with two hearts and high cards\n5. There's no bet to me - I can check\n\nI should check here. Betting would be a bluff, and against a tight opponent who called preflop, that's not a good idea. I have showdown value with my pair of 4s, but it's very marginal. Checking keeps the pot small and allows me to see a free card or fold if they bet.",

The turn bet of 4 into a 14 chip pot is a small bet (less than 1/3 pot).\n\n**My hand evaluation:**\n- I have bottom pair with a bad kicker\n- There are possible flush draws (hearts)\n- There are straight possibilities with 5-6 or 5-6-8-9 type hands\n- My two pair (4s and 2s) is very vulnerable to higher pairs, straights, and flushes\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot is 14, I need to call 4\n- Getting 3.5:1 pot odds (need ~22% equity)\n- Even if I'm behind, I might have some implied odds, but it's marginal\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. I have a weak made hand that could be ahead of some bluffs\n2. MiniMax-M2 is tight and their turn bet suggests some strength\n3. \n\nI'm getting reasonable pot odds, but the hand's vulnerability makes calling risky. The small bet size could indicate a probing bet or a weak made hand. However, my bottom pair is extremely weak, and many turn cards could dramatically worsen my situation. The potential for being drawn out and the opponent's tight playing style suggest folding is the most prudent move.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My hand:** Qh Jc - This is a decent but not premium hand. Suited would be better, but offsuit QJ is still playable in some situations.\n\n**Position:** SB - This is the worst position postflop, as I'll be first to act on every street.\n\n**Stack:** 212 chips (53 BB) - Healthy stack size.\n\n**The situation:** \n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 18 chips (2 from SB, 4 from BB, 12 from GPT-OSS-120B's raise)\n- I need to call 10 chips to see the flop\n- I can raise to at least 20 chips total\n\n**Opponent info from recall:**\nGPT-OSS-120B has raised to 12 chips in this hand. Looking at their history:\n- Hand 23: raise 12 (preflop)\n- Hand 21: raise 28 (preflop) then folded later\n- Hand 19: call 1, then check-folded on flop\n- Hand 18: folded on flop\n- Other hands: folded preflop\n\nThis suggests GPT-OSS-120B is somewhat aggressive preflop but can fold to pressure. The raise sizing of 12 (3x BB) is a standard opening size.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength:** QJo is marginal, especially from SB. It's dominated by many better hands (AQ, KQ, AJ, etc.)\n2. **Position:** Being in SB is a huge disadvantage - I'll be out of position for the entire hand\n3. **Pot odds:** I need to call 10 to win 18, so 1.8:1 pot odds. This isn't great for a marginal hand.\n4. **Implied odds:** Limited since I'm out of position\n5. **Tournament considerations:** I have a healthy stack. Calling here commits me to a tough spot postflop out of position with a marginal hand.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. QJo from SB facing a raise is a losing proposition long-term. I don't have the position, the hand isn't strong enough, and I'd be playing a guessing game postflop out of position. Better to preserve my chips for a better spot.",

This is a clear fold in most situations.\n\n**Position:**\nBeing on the Button is great, but with this weak hand, it's still not worth playing. The 4-chip call represents ~2% of my stack, which is small, but the hand has very little potential.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have a healthy stack (53 BB)\n- No need to take risks with marginal hands\n- Better spots will come\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n4 chips to win 6 chips = 1.5:1 pot odds, which is not great for a hand this weak.\n\nThe opponent data shows both players have been very tight recently, but that doesn't make 6-9 offsuit a profitable call.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my hand: 9d 2d in UTG position with 212 chips (53 BB). This is a very weak hand - 9-2 offsuit is one of the worst starting hands in poker.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 6 chips\n- To call: 4 chips\n- Minimum raise: 8 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\nFrom the opponent actions I can see:\n- Seat 2 (Kimi-K2): Has been raising preflop with some frequency (hands 26 and 27)\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Called a raise in hand 27, then bet on flop and river\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): Seems to fold frequently\n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Hand strength**: 9d 2d is extremely weak. It's unsuited, disconnected, and low. This hand has very little potential even if I hit something.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. If I call or raise, I have to act first on all subsequent streets with a weak hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 212 chips (53 BB) - This is a healthy stack. I don't need to take risks with garbage hands.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With a decent stack, I should be selective and wait for better spots. Playing 9-2 UTG is a recipe for trouble.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I'd have to call 4 chips to win 6. Even with these odds, the hand is just too weak to continue.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: The players behind me have shown aggression (Seat 2 raises, Seat 4 bets postflop). With a weak hand in bad position, I'm likely to face pressure.\n\nConclusion: This is a clear fold. 9-2 offsuit UTG is a standard fold in any situation, and with my stack size and opponent tendencies, there's no justification to play this hand.",

From their history:\n   - Hand 27: Called preflop 10, then bet flop 15, checked turn, bet river 15\n   - Hand 28: Raised preflop to 20, then folded (so they raised then folded to a re-raise)\n   - Hand 24: Checked flop, bet turn 4\n   - They tend to be active post-flop\n   \n3. My hand: 9c Js is weak offsuit. This is a marginal hand at best.\n\n4. Position: I'm out of position post-flop (I'll act first on all streets)\n\n5. Pot odds: I can check and see the flop for free\n\n**Decision factors:**\n- With a weak hand like 9c Js, checking is the standard play\n- I'm out of position, so I don't want to build a big pot with a marginal hand\n- MiniMax-M2 called rather than raised, so they likely have a medium-strength hand\n- I have no reason to raise here - my hand doesn't warrant it\n- Checking gives me a free look at the flop\n\n**Conclusion:** I should check. Raising would be spewing chips with a weak hand out of position. Folding is not an option since I can check for free.",

Just 9 high.\n\n**Opponent analysis**:\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They fold preflop quite a bit (hands 17, 18, 20, 25, 26, 28)\n- When they call preflop, they sometimes fold on flop (hand 19)\n- They've shown aggression with raises (hands 21, 28)\n- In hand 27, they called preflop 10, bet 15 on flop, checked turn, bet 15 on river - showing they can be aggressive postflop\n- In hand 24, they called preflop 4, checked flop, bet 4 on turn\n\n**Current situation**:\n- MiniMax called preflop from CO position (Seat 4)\n- No bet on flop yet\n- I have a very weak hand (9 high)\n\n**Decision**:\nI should check here. I have absolutely nothing - just 9 high. The board has two hearts (flush draw possible) and a straight draw possible with K-J. I have no pair, no draw.

I don't have a flush draw. My hand is currently just Jack-high with no pair. This is a very weak hand.\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history in seat 4:\n- They fold preflop frequently (hands 17, 18, 20, 25, 26, 28)\n- When they do play, they sometimes make small bets (hand 24: bet 4 on turn, hand 27: bet 15 on flop)\n- They made a big raise preflop in hand 21 (65 chips) and hand 28 (20 chips)\n- In hand 27, they showed down Jh Kc (Jack-high flush draw that didn't hit)\n\nThe pattern suggests MiniMax-M2 is somewhat aggressive but also folds a lot. Their current bet of 4 into a 14-chip pot is a small bet (less than 1/3 pot).\n\n**Pot odds:**\n- Pot: 14 chips\n- To call: 4 chips\n- Pot odds: 4/18 = 22.2%\n- I have a gutshot (4 outs out of 47 unknown cards = ~8.5% chance)\n\nThe pot odds are not good enough to call with just a gutshot draw. Even if I hit a King, it might not be the best hand (someone could have Ace-King or two hearts for a flush).\n\n**Position:**\nI'm out of position (acting first on future streets), which makes it harder to realize my equity.\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\nI have a healthy stack (52 BB). I don't need to take marginal spots like this. Preserving chips is important.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should fold. I don't have enough equity, the pot odds aren't favorable, I'm out of position, and my opponent could easily have a better hand. This is a clear fold.",

Prefers raising to 12 when they enter pots.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n- AQ suited hearts is a premium hand, especially on the button\n- Great for stealing, can dominate many hands\n- I have position on both players post-flop\n- Pot odds: Need to call 8 to win 22 (about 2.75:1) - very good\n\n**My Recent Play:**\n- I've been playing very tight (25 folds out of 30 hands)\n- My win rate is low (16.7%) suggesting I might be playing too tight\n- Need to be more aggressive with premium hands\n\n**Decision:**\nWith AQ suited on the button facing a small raise (only 2x BB) and a call, I should definitely play this hand. I have three options:\n\n1. **Call (8 chips)**: See a flop in position. Conservative but gives up initiative.\n2. **Raise**: Take control of the hand. With my tight image, a raise will get respect.\n   - Minimum raise to 12 is too small - gives good odds to opponents\n   - Standard raise would be to 24-32 (3-4x the raise)\n   - Given stack sizes, I could raise to 24 (3x) or even 32 (4x)\n\n3. **Fold**: Too tight with this premium hand and position.\n\nThe best play is to raise. A raise to 24-32 will:\n- Isolate one opponent or take down the pot preflop\n- Give me initiative post-flop\n- Leverage my tight image\n- Get value from weaker hands\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2 has shown they can fold to pressure, and GPT-OSS-120B can be tight, I'll make a solid raise to 28 (3.5x the original raise), which is a standard size.\n\nLet me reconsider: The pot is 22, I need to call 8. If I raise to 24 total (3x the 8), that's only adding 16 more. That might be too small. A better raise would be to 28 or 32. Given the stack depths (everyone has 45+ BB), I can raise to 32 comfortably.\n\nActually, looking at the minimum raise: \"Minimum raise to: 12\" - this means I need to put in at least 12 total, which is only 4 more than the 8 to call. That's a min-raise and not recommended.\n\nI think the better sizing is to 32 total (which is 24 more to call for others). This is about 4x the original raise, standard for a 3-bet.\n\nWait, let me think about this more carefully. The \"raise_to\" field should be the TOTAL amount I'm putting in. If I want to raise to 32, that means I'm putting in 32 chips total. Since the big blind was 4, and there's been a raise to 8, I need to match that 8 first, then add more.\n\nActually, I think the \"raise_to\" means the total bet size I want to make. So if I say \"raise_to\": 28, that means I'm betting 28 chips total. Since I need to call 8, I'm raising an additional 20.\n\nGiven my position, hand strength, and opponent tendencies, I should make a substantial raise. Let me go with 28 total, which is a 3.5x raise of the original 8. This is strong but not overcommitting.\n\n"

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand Information:**\n- Hand #31, FLOP stage\n- My Position: BTN (Button)\n- My Cards: Qh Ah (Ace-Queen suited, hearts)\n- My Stack: 178 chips\n- Board: 5h 3c 6d (rainbow, no flush draw possible yet, but I have backdoor flush draw)\n- Pot: 70 chips\n- Amount to call: 0 (Opponent checked)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n- Minimum raise to: 20\n\n**Preflop Action Analysis:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 8\n- Seat 5 called 8\n- I (Seat 1) 3-bet to 28\n- Seat 4 called 20 (so they have something)\n- Seat 5 folded\n\nSo going to the flop, it's heads-up between me and MiniMax-M2.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\n- I have AQh, which is a strong starting hand\n- Flop is 5h 3c 6d - completely missed me. I have no pair, no draw except backdoor flush and straight draws\n- However, this is a very dry, low board that likely missed my opponent's range too\n\n**Opponent Information (MiniMax-M2):**\nFrom the recall data:\n- Hand 26: Preflop fold\n- Hand 27: Called preflop 10, bet flop 15, checked turn, bet river 15\n- Hand 28: Raised preflop to 20, then folded to a 3-bet\n- Hand 29: Called preflop 4, bet flop 4\n- Hand 30: Raised preflop to 16\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 is active preflop, raises frequently (hands 28, 30), but folded to a 3-bet in hand 28. They also make small continuation bets.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- MiniMax-M2 called my preflop 3-bet, then checked the flop\n- This suggests they likely have a medium strength hand or a draw\n- The check could be:\n  1. Weak hand giving up\n  2. Strong hand trapping\n  3. Marginal hand checking to see what I do\n\n**My Options:**\n1. **Check**: Take a free card, see if I improve on turn. Pot is 70, I could check back and try to hit.\n2. **Raise (bet)**: Apply pressure. Since they checked, I can represent a strong hand. Minimum raise is 20 (which is a bet in this context).\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- I have position (on the button)\n- The board is very dry (5-3-6 rainbow)\n- My opponent called a 3-bet preflop, suggesting some strength\n- They checked, which is often weak\n- I have 2 overcards, which are good but not great\n- Stack sizes: I have 178, opponent has 163, so deep enough\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I should be looking to accumulate chips\n- With AQ on a dry board, a continuation bet is standard\n- Checking is too passive and gives up on the pot\n\n**Decision**: I should make a continuation bet. The standard sizing would be about 1/2 to 2/3 pot. Pot is 70, so 35-45 would be appropriate. Minimum is 20, which is about 28% of pot - a bit small but acceptable as a probe bet.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. Since the opponent checked to me, and the board is so dry, I should bet to take it down. A bet of 35 (half pot) would be good.\n\nBut wait - the minimum raise is listed as 20. In this context, since I'm the first to act on the flop and there's no bet to call, a \"raise\" of 20 means betting 20 chips total.\n\nLet me think about sizing:\n- 20 chips is 28% of pot (70) - small\n- 35 chips would be 50% of pot - standard\n- 45 chips would be 65% of pot - slightly larger\n\nGiven my opponent's tendency to make small bets themselves (they bet 15 into unknown pots in hands 27 and 29), a smaller bet might be effective. Also, since they folded to a 3-bet before, they might be capable of folding.\n\nI think a bet of 35 (half pot) is appropriate here. It applies pressure, charges draws, and gives me a chance to win the pot right now.\n\nActually, let me reconsider the format. It says \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount. So if I want to bet 35, I put"

This is a strong drawing hand on a dry board. I have 6 outs to top pair (3 Queens, 3 Aces), plus backdoor flush and straight possibilities.\n\n2. **Opponent Tendencies**: From the recall data, MiniMax-M2:\n   - Raises preflop frequently (hands 28, 30)\n   - Folded to a 3-bet once (hand 28)\n   - Makes small continuation bets (15 chips in hands 27, 29)\n   - Has shown they can fold\n\n3. **Board Texture**: Very dry - 5-3-6 rainbow. Unlikely to have hit opponent's preflop calling range hard. They would likely have bet if they had a set or two pair.\n\n4. **Position**: I have the button, which is a huge advantage. I can control the pot size and get information.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: Pot is 70, if I bet 35 (half pot), I'm risking 35 to win 70.\n\n6. **Tournament Strategy**: I should be accumulating chips. Checking here is too passive and gives up on a pot I could win.\n\n**Decision**: I should make a continuation bet. This is a standard play with AQ on a dry board after being the preflop aggressor. The opponent's check suggests weakness.\n\n**Sizing**: A half-pot bet of 35 chips is appropriate.

          "content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- My hand: Qh Ah (nut flush draw on the flop, now just Ace-high)\n- Position: BTN\n- Stack: 143 chips\n- Pot: 175 chips\n- Board: 5h 3c 6d Td 9h\n- Opponent: MiniMax-M2 (Seat 4) with 93 chips\n- To call: 35 chips\n- Minimum raise: 70 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Preflop: I 3-bet with AQo, opponent called\n- Flop: 5h 3c 6d - I bet 35, opponent called (I had flush draw)\n- Turn: Td - I checked, opponent checked\n- River: 9h - Opponent bets 35\n\nThe board now shows: 5h 3c 6d Td 9h\n- No flush possible (hearts on 5h and 9h only)\n- Straight possibilities: 7-8 makes a straight, also 7-4 makes a wheel\n- I have Ace-high with Qh\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at MiniMax-M2's history:\n- They fold frequently preflop (hands 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 30)\n- When they do play, they can be aggressive (hand 21: raised 16 then 65, hand 27: bet 15 on flop and 15 on river)\n- Hand 27 showdown: they had Jh Kc on board 8c 6d 5d 3h Ac - they bet 15 on river with just King-high on an Ace-high board\n- Hand 24: called preflop, checked flop, bet 4 on turn\n- Hand 29: called preflop, bet 4 on flop\n\nThis opponent seems to make small value bets and can bluff. The 35-chip bet on the river is about 20% of the pot.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Pot: 175 chips\n- To call: 35 chips\n- Pot odds: 210:35 or 6:1\n\n\n- I only need to win 14.3% of the time to break even\n\n**My Hand Strength:**\n- I have Ace-high\n- The board is relatively coordinated with straight possibilities\n- My opponent called a 3-bet preflop and called a 35-chip flop bet\n- The turn check-check suggests weakness from both sides\n- The river bet could be:\n  1. A value bet with a made hand (pair, two pair, straight)\n  2. A bluff with missed draws\n  3. A thin value bet with Ace-high (like they did in hand 27)\n\n**Opponent's Range:**\nGiven they called a 3-bet preflop and called a flop bet on 5h 3c 6d, they could have:\n- Pocket pairs (77, 88, 99, TT, JJ, QQ, KK, AA)\n- Suited connectors that hit the board\n- Ace-high hands\n- Some bluffs\n\nOn the river board (5h 3c 6d Td 9h), they could have:\n- Made straights: 78, 74\n- Two pairs: T9, 96, 65, etc.\n- Pairs: TT, 99, 66, 55, 33\n- Ace-high hands\n- Complete air/bluffs\n\n**Decision:**\nThe opponent's betting pattern is interesting. They checked the turn, which suggests they didn't have a strong hand. Now they're betting 35 on the river. This could be:\n1. A value bet with a made hand that checked turn for pot control\n2. A bluff with missed draws\n3. A thin value bet with Ace-high or a small pair\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to make small bets (as seen in hands 24, 27, 29), and the fact that they called a 3-bet preflop and a flop bet, I think they have some showdown value. However, the price is good (6:1 pot odds).\n\nI need to win only 14.3% of the time. With Ace-high, against an opponent who can bluff and make thin value bets, I think I have enough equity to call. The opponent's stack is only 93 chips, so they're not betting huge relative to their stack.\n\nHowever, I should also consider that my opponent might be betting a made hand that checked the turn for pot control. The board is somewhat coordinated, and they might have hit two pair or a straight.\n\nLet me think about the EV:\n- If I call and win: +210 chips\n\n\n- If I call and lose: -35 chips\n- Break-even point:"

Let me think through this more carefully.\n\nCurrent situation:\n- I have AQ (Ace-high) on a board of 5h 3c 6d Td 9h\n- Pot is 175, opponent bet 35 (giving me 6:1 pot odds)\n- I only need to win ~14.3% of the time to break even\n- Opponent has 93 chips left (short stack relative to the pot)\n\nWhat hands could opponent have?\n- They called a 3-bet preflop from me\n- They called a 35-chip bet on flop of 5h 3c 6d\n- They checked the turn (Td)\n- They bet 35 on river (9h)\n\nThe turn check is key. If they had a strong hand like an overpair, two pair, or a straight, they likely would have bet the turn. The fact they checked suggests weakness.\n\nOn the river, they could be:\n1. Value betting a made hand (pair, two pair, straight)\n2. Bluffing with missed draws\n3.

I think Ace-high has enough equity against this opponent's range to call. The opponent's small bet sizing relative to the pot suggests they might be making a thin value bet or bluffing.\n\nI should call here.

From UTG (first position), this is a clear fold:\n- Very low equity against typical calling ranges\n- Dominated by many hands (AJ, KJ, QJ, J10, J9, etc.)\n- No suited potential\n- No connectivity\n- Playing from worst position\n\n**Opponent Information:**\nFrom the recent actions, I can see MiniMax-M2 in Seat 4 is quite active:\n- Raised preflop in hand #31\n- Called a raise in hand #31\n- Called on flop, bet on river\n- Seems to be playing fairly aggressively\n\nHowever, this doesn't change the fact that 7Jo is a terrible hand from UTG.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I have 27 BB, which is a decent stack\n- No need to risk chips with a weak hand\n- Better to wait for better spots\n- Preserving my stack is important\n\n**Decision:** Clear fold. This is an easy decision - I have a weak hand in early position with no reason to get involved.",

Let me think about the key factors:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: KhJs is a decent hand but vulnerable in early position. It's often dominated by AK, KQ, AJ, AA, KK, QQ, JJ.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I'll be first to act on all streets with 4 players still to act behind me.\n\n3. **Stack size**: 27 BB is a medium stack. Not desperate yet, but I need to be careful.\n\n4. **Opponents**: I don't have much history on them since the search didn't return results. Seat 2 is also named Kimi-K2 which is interesting - might be the same player type.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 27 BB, I should be somewhat selective. This is a fold or raise spot, not a call spot typically.\n\nStandard play: KhJs from UTG with 27 BB is typically a fold. It's too weak to raise from early position and too strong to open-limp (which isn't an option anyway). \n\nThe issues:\n- If I raise and get 3-bet, I'll likely have to fold\n- If I call, I'm inviting multi-way action with a hand that plays poorly multi-way\n- I'm out of position against everyone\n\nDecision: Fold.

It's not connected, not suited, and the queen is vulnerable to domination.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is the best position post-flop. This gives me an advantage.\n\n3. **Opponent Tendencies**: GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32), but has shown they can raise big (hand 28 with 162 chips). They just called the SB, which could mean:\n   - They have a marginal hand they want to see a flop with cheaply\n   - They're trying to trap with a strong hand\n   - They're just completing the blind\n\n4. **Stack Sizes**: I have 104 chips (26 BB), which is a decent stack. I can afford to see a flop here since there's no additional cost (amount to call is 0).\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: The pot is 8 chips and I can check for free, so infinite pot odds to see the flop.\n\n6. **Tournament Consideration**: I'm not desperate yet with 26 BB. I can afford to see a flop in position with a weak hand since it's free. If I hit something strong (like two pair, trips, straight draw), I can potentially win a decent pot. If I miss completely, I can easily fold.\n\n7. **Risk/Reward**: Checking risks nothing. If I raise, I'm bloating the pot with a weak hand out of position post-flop (since SB will act first on all streets). This is generally not advisable with Q5o.\n\n**Decision**: I should check and see a free flop in position. There's no reason to raise with this weak hand, and I have good position to evaluate post-flop.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- My cards: 5d Qh (offsuit, not connected)\n- Board: 6h Js 4c\n- Position: BTN (good position)\n- Stack: 104 chips (26 BB)\n- Pot: 8 chips\n- Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B has checked to me on the flop\n\n**Hand strength:** I have Q-high with no pair, no draw. This is a very weak hand.\n\n**Position:** I have position advantage on the flop since I'm on the BTN and acting last.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at the recall data for GPT-OSS-120B:\n- They frequently fold preflop (hands 20, 22, 24, 26, 27, 29, 30, 32)\n- When they do enter pots, they often check-fold on the flop (hands 18, 19)\n- They've made some large preflop raises (hand 21: 28 chips, hand 28: 162 chips)\n- They called preflop in hand 31 and then folded\n\nThe opponent just checked on the flop, which based on their pattern, often indicates weakness. However, I have absolutely nothing - just Q-high. The board has a J and 6, 4 - all disconnected. \n\n**Pot odds:** Pot is 8 chips, it costs me 0 to check. If I bet, minimum raise is 4 chips.\n\n**Decision:** Even though the opponent showed weakness by checking, I have a terrible hand. Q-high is unlikely to be good here. The opponent could have:\n- Any pair (Jx, 6x, 4x)\n- Any draw (though not many draws on this board)\n- Or they could genuinely be weak\n\nBut with Q-high, I'm basically bluffing if I bet. While a small bluff might work given their check-fold tendencies, I also need to consider that:\n1. This is a tournament and I should be somewhat protective of my 26 BB stack\n2. The board is somewhat dry but not great for a bluff\n\n\n3. I have no equity if called\n4. I can check and see a free card to potentially improve\n\nA cautious approach makes the most sense here. Checking costs nothing and gives me a chance to see another card without risking chips. The free card might improve my hand, and I'll reassess based on the opponent's next action. Checking is the most prudent move given my complete lack of hand strength.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: 5d Qh (off-suit, low-medium cards)\n- Stack: 104 chips (26 BB)\n- Board: 6h Js 4c 2c\n- Pot: 8 chips\n- To call: 0 (I can check for free)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- My hand: Q5o (Queen-Five offsuit)\n- Board: 6h Js 4c 2c\n- I have no pair, no draw. Just Queen-high.\n- The board has a possible flush draw (clubs) and straight possibilities (3-5, 4-6, etc.)\n\n**Opponent analysis (Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B):**\nFrom the recall data, I can see:\n- They check-fold frequently postflop (hands 18, 19)\n- They make occasional preflop raises (hands 21, 23, 25, 28)\n- In hand 28 they raised 162 chips (very large raise)\n- They seem to be a tight-aggressive player who folds to pressure\n\n**Current action:**\n- Preflop: I was BB, they were SB. They called 2, I checked.\n- Flop: They checked, I checked.\n- Turn: They checked.\n\nThis pattern suggests weakness. They've checked twice now, showing no aggression.\n\n**My decision:**\nI have absolutely nothing (Queen-high). The board is coordinated with straight and flush draws possible. Even though my opponent has shown weakness by checking twice, I have a very weak hand with no draw. \n\nChecking is the correct play here because:\n1. I have no hand strength\n2. No draws\n3. The board is coordinated and could easily have hit their range\n4. I'm out of position (though I'm actually on the button, so I have position)\n\n\n5. No value in betting - I can't get called by worse\n\nI'll carefully consider a potential bluff. The opponent's pattern of frequent folding suggests some opportunity, but my current hand is too weak to risk chips. The free card offers a chance to improve without additional investment. Checking maintains my tournament life and avoids unnecessary chip loss with a marginal hand.\n\nThe strategic move is clear: take the free card, preserve my stack, and wait for a stronger opportunity to apply pressure. Checking costs nothing and keeps my options open for future hands.",

Since the pot is small and my opponent has been passive, I should make a value bet. \n\nGiven the pot is 8 chips, a bet of around 50-75% pot (4-6 chips) seems appropriate. However, I need to consider:\n1. If I bet too small, I might not get enough value\n2. If I bet too big, they might fold\n\nLet me make a value bet of 6 chips (75% pot) to try to get called by worse hands like pairs, two pairs, or maybe a lower straight if they somehow have it.\n\nActually, looking at the board again: 6h Js 4c 2c 3c\nWait, let me recount: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 would be a straight.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **Hand Analysis**: Td 5c is a very weak hand in the SB. It's unsuited and disconnected, with only a backdoor straight possibility.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the SB, which is the worst position post-flop. I'll be out of position against the BB and the caller (GPT-OSS-120B).\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 110 chips (27.5 BB), which is a decent stack. I shouldn't be taking unnecessary risks with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Opponent Behavior**: Looking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n   - They called preflop in hand #34 (from BB position, likely checking)\n   - They checked through flop, turn, river in hand #34 and then folded\n   - They called 8 chips in hand #31 and then folded\n   - Generally passive, calling and checking rather than raising\n\n5. **Current Action**: The action is to me in SB. There's already 10 chips in the pot. I need to call 2 more chips to see the flop.\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I'm getting 5:1 pot odds (10:2), which is attractive, but with T5o I have very little equity even against random hands.\n\n7. **Tournament Considerations**: With 27.5 BB, I should be selective. My VPIP (voluntarily put money in pot) has been low based on my hand history - I've folded a lot. This suggests I should continue to be tight, especially from SB with a weak hand.\n\n8. **My Recent Results**: I won hand #34 with a river bet, but overall my win rate is only 17.6%. I should stick to stronger hands.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. T5o is a trash hand, I'm out of position, and even though the pot odds are good, the reverse implied odds are terrible. I don't want to get involved with such a weak hand that will be difficult to play post-flop.\n\nThe fact that GPT-OSS-120B called suggests they might have something, and I'll be out of position against both players. Better to wait for a better spot.",

It's playable from BTN\n2. Position: I'm on the button, which is great position postflop\n3. Stack size: I have 110 chips which is 27.5 BB - this is a relatively short stack but not desperate\n4. Opponents: Only SB and BB remain, both have larger stacks\n5. Pot odds: I need to call 4 to win 6 (1.5:1)\n\nLet me think about what I should do:\n- Folding seems too tight with KTs on the button\n- Calling is reasonable, keeping the pot small and seeing a flop in position\n- Raising could be good to try to steal the blinds or build a pot with a decent hand\n\nWith KTs on the button, I should be opening this hand most of the time. Since I'm on the button and it's folded to me, this is a good spot to raise and try to steal the blinds. The minimum raise is to 8 (2x the BB), which is a standard open size.\n\nI have 27.5 BB, so I can afford a raise here. Raising to 8 would be about 2 BB, leaving me with 25.5 BB if I get called or folded to.\n\nLet me check if there are any specific opponent tendencies I should consider, but the system is asking me to respond with JSON format. I should just make a decision.\n\nI'll raise to 8 chips as a standard button steal attempt with KTs. This is a solid hand that plays well postflop, and I'm in position.",

Playing J7o from UTG is -EV.\n\n6. **Pot odds**: I need to call 4 chips to see a flop, but even with good pot odds, this hand is too weak to play from UTG.\n\nThe clear decision here is to fold.

This sizing doesn't over-commit my 110 chip stack while applying pressure.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- I'm in SB with Qd As (Ace-Queen suited)\n- My stack: 110 chips (27.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot: 18 chips\n- Facing a raise from GPT-OSS-120B in Seat 5 to 12 chips (3x BB)\n- Need to call 10 chips to continue\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nLooking at GPT-OSS-120B's recent actions:\n- Hand 39: Preflop fold\n- Hand 38: Preflop check (BB), flop fold\n- Hand 37: Preflop fold\n- Hand 36: Preflop fold\n- Hand 35: Preflop call 4, flop bet 8\n- Hand 34: Turn check, river check, river fold\n\nThis opponent seems to be playing relatively tight, folding a lot preflop. When they do enter hands (like hand 35), they show aggression postflop. The raise to 12 chips from late position suggests a strong hand.\n\n**My Hand Analysis:**\nQd As is a premium hand, especially from SB. It's:\n- Top 5-6% hand strength\n- Strong against most ranges\n- Has good playability postflop\n- Can dominate weaker aces and queens\n\n**Stack/Pot Considerations:**\n- I have 110 chips, so calling 10 is only ~9% of my stack\n- The pot is already 18, and I need to call 10, giving me 1.8:1 immediate odds\n- If I 3-bet, I could take control of the hand\n- My stack is healthy at 27.5 BB, not desperate\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm out of position as SB, which is a disadvantage\n- However, with a premium hand like AQ, this is less concerning\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm not short-stacked, so I don't need to take unnecessary risks\n- But AQ is strong enough to play for value\n- I could 3-bet to define my opponent's range and potentially win the pot preflop\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Too tight with AQ. This is a clear fold only if opponent is extremely tight and we have strong reads.\n2. **Call**: Reasonable. I see a flop with a strong hand, keep the pot smaller out of position.\n3. **Raise**: Also reasonable. 3-betting to ~30-35 chips would be standard. This would:\n   - Define opponent's range\n   - Take initiative\n   - Potentially win preflop\n   - Build pot when I likely have the best hand\n\nLooking at my recent hands from SB, I've been folding a lot (hands 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 all folded preflop). This suggests I should start playing back with strong hands.\n\nGiven that GPT-OSS-120B has been folding a lot preflop but just raised, they likely have a strong range (AJ+, KQ+, 77+). AQ is doing well against this range.\n\nI think the best play is to **3-bet**. I should raise to about 30-35 chips (2.5-3x the raise). This is standard with AQ out of position.\n\nLet me calculate the raise amount:\n- Minimum raise is 20 (to match the raise amount)\n- Standard 3-bet would be 3x their raise = 36 chips\n- I could also go slightly less, like 30-32 chips\n\nGiven my stack and position, I'll raise to 30 chips. This is a solid 3-bet size that:\n- Gives them bad odds to call with marginal hands\n- Doesn't commit too much of my stack\n- Leaves room to fold if they 4-bet big\n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 110 chips and facing a 12 chip raise, if I 3-bet to 30 and they 4-bet, I might be in a tough spot. But AQ is strong enough to call a 4-bet or even shove depending on sizing.\n\nI think raising to 30 is the correct play. It shows strength, defines their range, and builds the pot with what is likely the best hand.",

My opponent called my 3-bet preflop, suggesting a decent hand, but I likely have them beat with top pair. I should bet for value against weaker Aces and pocket pairs, and to protect against any potential straight draws. Betting half pot (32 chips) extracts value while keeping the pot manageable given my 20.5 BB stack.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  The hand history shows I have A\u2660 Q\u2666 on a board of 3\u2665 4\u2660 A\u2663. I have top pair with a good kicker (Ace with Queen kicker). The pot is 64 chips and I have 82 chips left.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: I have top pair (Aces) with a good kicker (Queen). The board is relatively dry - only a possible straight draw with 2-5 or 5-7, but it's unlikely given the action. There's no flush draw. I likely have the best hand here.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the BB position. The opponent (GPT-OSS-120B) is in Seat 5, which would be the cutoff or button position depending on the table setup. They have position on me.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: From the history I just recalled:\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been playing quite tight - lots of folds preflop\n   - They made one big raise of 162 chips preflop in hand 28 (which suggests they can have strong hands)\n   - In hand 34, they called preflop, then checked down to the river and folded\n   - In hand 35, they called preflop and bet 8 on the flop\n   - They seem to be a relatively tight player who doesn't get involved much\n\n4. **Action analysis**: Preflop, they raised to 12, I re-raised to 30, and they called 18. This suggests they have a decent hand that could call a 3-bet. Their range likely includes: pocket pairs (TT+), AJ+, KQ, maybe some suited connectors.\n\n5. **Board texture**: The A\u2663 3\u2665 4\u2660 board is good for my hand but also connects with many hands that would call a 3-bet:\n   - Any Ace (but I have them out-kicked with AQ unless they have AK or AQ)\n   - Pocket pairs (but only AA beats me, and they'd likely 4-bet with AA)\n   - No real draws except a gutshot with 5 (for a straight) or 2-5, 5-7\n   \nLooking at my hand, I have a strong hand. But I need to consider that my opponent called my 3-bet preflop. They could have:\n- A weaker Ace (AJ, AT) - I'm ahead\n- A pocket pair (KK, QQ, JJ, TT) - I'm ahead except AA\n- AK - I'm behind\n- AQ - we're chopping\n- Some suited connectors or bluffs - I'm ahead\n\nGiven that I have top pair good kicker, and the board is relatively dry, I should make a value bet here. I need to charge any draws (though there are few) and get value from weaker hands.\n\nMy stack is 82 chips, and the pot is 64 chips. I should bet about 1/2 to 2/3 pot for value. A bet of 32-42 chips seems appropriate.\n\nHowever, I need to consider my stack size. I'm relatively short-stacked at 20.5 BB. If I bet and get raised, I might have to commit my stack. But with top pair top kicker on a dry board, I'm comfortable getting it in against this opponent who seems to play straightforwardly.\n\nLet me think about the minimum raise amount. It says minimum raise to 18, but that seems odd since the amount to call is 0. Let me check - actually, the minimum bet is probably 18 (maybe 1/2 pot or something). I should bet for value.\n\nI'll make a bet of about 32 chips (half pot) to extract value from weaker hands and protect my hand.",

K3o is not strong enough to raise for value, and calling would put me in difficult postflop spots. The loose player in SB might defend their blind, and the tight BB might have a real hand when they call.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold. This hand is too weak, especially with a short stack. I should wait for better opportunities to either shove preflop or play a hand with better equity in position.",

It's in the top 5-10% of starting hands.\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I have 7 players to act behind me. This means I need to be more cautious.\n3. **Stack Size**: 18.2 BB is in the \"medium stack\" territory. I can't be too reckless, but I have room to play.\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: From the memory recall, I see:\n   - Kimi-K2 (seat 2) has been active with raises (hands 39, 41)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) has been folding a lot\n   - MiniMax-M2 and DeepSeek-V3.2 have been folding to aggression\n\n**Tournament dynamics:**\n- I'm UTG with a premium hand. In tournaments, KQs from UTG is typically a raise or fold decision. Calling is generally not recommended from this position with a strong hand because:\n  - It invites multiway pots which reduce my equity\n  - I don't have position\n  - It gives opponents good odds to call with weaker hands\n\n**Action options:**\n- **Fold**: Too tight for KQs. This is a premium hand.\n- **Call**: Not ideal. It doesn't define my hand, invites multiway action, and I lose initiative.\n- **Raise**: The standard play. I should raise to:\n  - Build the pot with a strong hand\n  - Get value from worse hands\n  - Thin the field (ideally to 1-2 opponents)\n  - Take initiative\n\n**Raise sizing**: \n- Minimum raise is 16 (2x BB)\n- Standard open from UTG with 18BB stack would be around 2.5-3x BB = 20-24 chips\n- I should raise to 24 (3x BB) to:\n  - Charge opponents adequately\n  - Protect my hand\n  - Still leave me with a playable stack if I have to fold to a 3-bet\n\n**Conclusion**: Raise to 24 chips. This is a standard, strong play with KQs from UTG in a tournament setting.",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand Details:**\n- My Position: BB (Seat 1)\n- My Cards: Qs Ks (King-Queen suited in spades)\n- My Stack: 122 chips (15.2 BB)\n- Board: 9h Th 8c (9\u2665 T\u2665 8\u2663)\n- Pot: 92 chips\n- Amount to call: 16 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Action History:**\n- Preflop: Seat 3 (SB) posts 4, Seat 4 (BB) posts 8\n- Preflop: Seat 5 folds\n- Preflop: I (Seat 1) raise to 24\n- Preflop: Seat 2 calls 24\n- Preflop: Seat 3 folds\n- Preflop: Seat 4 calls 16\n- Flop: Seat 4 bets 16\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength:** I have K\u2660 Q\u2660 on a 9\u2665 T\u2665 8\u2663 board. This is a very strong drawing hand:\n   - Open-ended straight draw (J gives me a straight, any J gives me the nut straight)\n   - Two overcards (K and Q)\n   - Backdoor flush draw (spades)\n   - Gutshot straight draw to a king-high straight (need a J)\n\n2. **Pot Odds:** Pot is 92, I need to call 16. That's 92:16 or 5.75:1 pot odds. This is very favorable.\n\n3. **Position:** I'm in early position (BB), which is a disadvantage post-flop.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies:** I just looked up MiniMax-M2's actions. They have been very tight - folding most preflop hands. In hand 38, they called preflop and then bet on the flop. This suggests they may have hit this board or have a strong hand.\n\n5. **Board Texture:** The board is coordinated with 9-T-8. This is a very wet board with many possible straights and straight draws. The flush draw is also possible with two hearts.\n\n6. **Stack Size:** I have 122 chips left, which is 15.2 BB. This is a decent stack but not huge.\n\n7. **The Bet:** Seat 4 bet 16 into a 92 pot, which is a small bet (about 17% of pot). This could be:\n   - A probe bet with a weak hand\n   - A value bet with a strong hand\n   - A protection bet with a made hand\n\n**Decision:**\n\nWith my open-ended straight draw (any J gives me the nuts), two overcards, and backdoor flush draw, I have significant equity. The pot odds of 5.75:1 are excellent. \n\nI should consider raising here for several reasons:\n1. I have a strong draw and want to build the pot\n2. A raise could get better hands to fold (like weaker draws or pairs)\n3. I have fold equity\n4. If I hit my straight, I want a bigger pot\n\nHowever, I need to be careful because:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. The board is very coordinated and my opponent could already have a straight\n3. Seat 2 is still to act behind me\n\nGiven the pot odds and my draw strength, calling is definitely profitable. But raising might be better to apply pressure and build the pot.\n\nLet me consider the raise size. Minimum raise is to 32 (another 16 on top of the 16 call). A raise to about 50-60 might be appropriate.\n\nActually, looking at my stack of 122, if I raise to around 60-70, I'm committing a significant portion of my stack. \n\nI think the best play is to **raise**. I have a strong draw and want to apply pressure. I'll make it 60 total (which is 44 more than calling the 16).\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The minimum raise is to 32. If I raise to 60, that's a 44-chip raise. Let me think about a more standard size.\n\nA typical raise would be to about 3x the bet, so around 48-56. Given the pot is 92, a raise to 60 seems reasonable.\n\nActually, let me think more carefully about the raise sizing. The bet was 16. A standard raise would be to 48-56 (3x-3.5x). I'll go with 56 total.\n\nBut wait - I should also consider that if I raise and get re-raised, I might have to fold or commit my stack. With a drawing hand, that could be problematic.\n\nLet me reconsider: The pot odds are excellent at 5.75:1. My hand has good equity"

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand step by step:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: Qs Ks (King-Queen suited - spades)\n- Stack: 106 chips (13.2 BB)\n- Pot: 108 chips\n- Board: 9h Th 8c Qd\n- Amount to call: 0 (opponent checked)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: I have top pair (Queens) with a King kicker. However, the board is very coordinated with 9h-Th-8c-Qd. There are both straight and flush draws possible. Any Jack gives a straight (T-J-Q-K), and there are two hearts on board for a potential flush draw.\n\n2. **My hand**: Qs Ks - I have top pair good kicker, but the board is dangerous.\n\n3. **Opponent**: MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 (BB position this hand)\n   - They posted BB preflop, called my preflop raise\n   - On the flop they bet 16 into a pot that was ~72 (after preflop action)\n   - I called that flop bet\n   - Now on the turn they checked\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Pot is 108 chips, and I have 106 chips left. This is essentially a pot-sized bet remaining in my stack.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies from recall**: \n   - MiniMax-M2 has been fairly active preflop with raises and calls\n   - They tend to bet on flops when they have initiative (hands 29, 38)\n   - They checked turn in hand 31 after calling a flop bet\n\n6. **Current action**: They checked to me on the turn. This could mean:\n   - They're weak and giving up\n   - They have a draw and want to see a free card\n   - They're trapping with a strong hand\n\n**My analysis**:\n- I have top pair, but the board is very coordinated. Any Jack makes a straight, and there are flush draws.\n- The opponent bet on the flop (16 into ~72), which I called. Now they checked the turn.\n- This check could be weakness or a trap. Given they bet the flop, they likely have something.\n- With my stack at 106 and pot at 108, I'm in a tough spot. If I bet and get raised, I'm likely behind.\n- Checking gives a free card, which is dangerous on this board.\n- A small value bet might be appropriate, but I need to be careful.\n\n**Decision**: \nI think checking is the best option here. The board is very coordinated, and while I have top pair, many draws are possible. The opponent's flop bet followed by turn check suggests they might have a medium-strength hand or draw that they're not confident betting with again. \n\nIf I bet and face a raise, I'll be in a very difficult spot with my tournament life on the line. Checking controls the pot size and allows me to see the river card, after which I can re-evaluate.\n\nLet me check what a good raise amount would be if I decide to bet... Actually, given the coordinated board and my tournament situation, I think checking is the safest play. I want to see the river card before committing more chips.",

The board is 9\u2665 T\u2665 8\u2663 Q\u2666 3\u2663.\n\nLet me evaluate the board:\n- No flush possible (hearts don't connect, clubs don't connect)\n- Straight possible: J-9 combo makes a straight (J-9-T-8-Q) - so hands like J9 would make a straight\n- Also 7-6 makes a straight (7-6-8-9-T)\n- Sets are possible with 99, TT, 88, QQ, 33\n- Two pairs are possible\n- I have top pair with good kicker\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the search results, MiniMax-M2 appears to be a relatively tight player:\n- Hand 32: Folded to a raise from CO\n- Hand 33: Folded UTG\n- Hand 34: Folded BB, then checked down and won with Q5 against GPT-OSS-120B\n- Hand 35: Folded SB\n- Hand 36: Folded to button raise (I won that hand)\n- Hand 37: Folded to 3-bet\n- Hand 38: Called preflop, then led out on flop and won\n- Hand 39: Folded to preflop raise\n- Hand 40: Folded SB\n- Hand 41: Folded CO\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 folds often preflop, but when they do play (Hand 38), they can be aggressive postflop. They seem to play straightforwardly - folding weak hands, playing strong hands.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Preflop: I raised 3BB (24), got called by Seat 2 and MiniMax-M2\n- Flop: MiniMax-M2 bet 16 (small bet) into 72 pot, I called, Seat 2 folded\n- Turn: Check-check\n- River: Check to me\n\nThe line suggests MiniMax-M2 might have:\n1. A medium strength hand that's scared of the Q (like JJ, TT, 99, 88)\n2. A draw that missed (hearts draw, straight draw)\n\n\n3. A weaker Q (like QJ, QT)\n4. A monster checking to trap (less likely given their straightforward style)\n\nMiniMax-M2's check on the river signals uncertainty. With a pot-sized bet of 108 and 106 chips in my stack, I'm facing a critical decision that could define my tournament trajectory. The 1:1 pot odds make a value bet compelling, especially given my top pair with a strong kicker.

The board is 9\u2665 T\u2665 8\u2663 Q\u2666 3\u2663.\n\nLet me evaluate the board:\n- No flush possible (hearts don't connect, clubs don't connect)\n- Straight possible: J-9 combo makes a straight (J-9-T-8-Q) - so hands like J9 would make a straight\n- Also 7-6 makes a straight (7-6-8-9-T)\n- Sets are possible with 99, TT, 88, QQ, 33\n- Two pairs are possible\n- I have top pair with good kicker\n\n**Opponent tendencies:**\nFrom the search results, MiniMax-M2 appears to be a relatively tight player:\n- Hand 32: Folded to a raise from CO\n- Hand 33: Folded UTG\n- Hand 34: Folded BB, then checked down and won with Q5 against GPT-OSS-120B\n- Hand 35: Folded SB\n- Hand 36: Folded to button raise (I won that hand)\n- Hand 37: Folded to 3-bet\n- Hand 38: Called preflop, then led out on flop and won\n- Hand 39: Folded to preflop raise\n- Hand 40: Folded SB\n- Hand 41: Folded CO\n\nPattern: MiniMax-M2 folds often preflop, but when they do play (Hand 38), they can be aggressive postflop. They seem to play straightforwardly - folding weak hands, playing strong hands.\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Preflop: I raised 3BB (24), got called by Seat 2 and MiniMax-M2\n- Flop: MiniMax-M2 bet 16 (small bet) into 72 pot, I called, Seat 2 folded\n- Turn: Check-check\n- River: Check to me\n\nThe line suggests MiniMax-M2 might have:\n1. A medium strength hand that's scared of the Q (like JJ, TT, 99, 88)\n2. A draw that missed (hearts draw, straight draw)\n\n\n3. A weaker Q (like QJ, QT)\n4. A monster checking to trap (less likely given their straightforward style)\n\nMiniMax-M2's check on the river signals uncertainty. With a pot-sized bet of 108 and 106 chips in my stack, I'm facing a critical decision that could define my tournament trajectory. The 1:1 pot odds make a value bet compelling, especially given my top pair with a strong kicker. My short stack demands aggressive chip accumulation, making this a prime opportunity to extract maximum value or potentially take down the pot.\n\nI need to carefully consider my opponent's potential holdings and the tournament dynamics. A strategic river bet could significantly impact my chip position and overall tournament strategy.\n\nThe opponent's check suggests vulnerability, creating an opportunity for a well-calculated value extraction.

When they do raise, they seem to be giving up on the flop frequently.\n\n**Current situation**:\n- I need to call 4 chips (half a BB) to see a flop\n- Pot is 20 chips, giving me 5:1 immediate pot odds\n- I would be out of position postflop\n- My hand is very weak (Q3o)\n\nGiven:\n1.

I have a healthy stack and don't need to take marginal spots\n5. Even with 5:1 pot odds, this hand will rarely win and I'll be playing out of position\n\nI should fold. The only consideration might be that it's very cheap (4 chips), but even then, playing Q3o out of position against an opponent who seems active is not profitable in the long run. \n\nI should save my chips for better spots.",

Not a premium hand by any means.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position.\n\n**Stack**: 214 chips (26.8 BB) - This is a decent stack, not desperate.\n\n**Action**: \n- SB posted 4\n- BB posted 8\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 16\n- Seat 5 folded\n\n**To call**: 16 chips\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Very tight preflop play - folded in hands 40, 41, 43, 44, 45\n- In hand 42, they called 16 preflop, then bet 16 on flop, checked turn and river, then folded on river\n- This suggests they play fairly straightforward/tight poker\n\n**Pot odds**: Pot is 28, I need to call 16. So pot odds are 28:16 or 1.75:1. This means I need ~36% equity to call.\n\n**Hand equity**: 6h 9c against a typical raising range (say 15-20% of hands) has roughly 30-35% equity. It's marginal at best.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: \n- I have 26.8 BB, which is comfortable\n- I don't need to take marginal spots\n- The raiser seems tight, so their range is strong\n- I'm in position, which helps, but the hand is just too weak\n\n**Decision**: Fold. The hand is too weak, the opponent seems tight and strong, and I don't need to risk chips in a marginal spot. I can find better spots with my decent stack and position.\n\nLet me make sure I'm following the JSON format correctly.",

Even though the call is small relative to my stack, playing this hand would be -EV in the long run. I should wait for better spots, especially given my position.\n\nThe only consideration could be if I want to mix in a bluff raise, but with no information on opponents and being out of position, this would be a bad idea.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: UTG (first to act)\n- Cards: 6d Jh (offsuit, weak hand)\n- Stack: 214 chips (26.8 BB)\n- Blinds: 4/8\n- Pot: 12 chips\n- To call: 8 chips\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- J6o is a very weak starting hand, especially from UTG position\n- From early position, I should only play premium hands\n- J6o has very little potential - no suitedness, no connectivity, and a weak kicker\n\n**My Recent History:**\nLooking at my recent hands, I've been folding a lot (36 folds out of 47 hands). This is actually good - I've been disciplined and not playing weak hands. My win rate is 21.3% which is decent for tournament play where survival matters.\n\nHand #43 is particularly relevant - I had Jd6c from UTG and folded preflop. That's the same hand structure I have now (J6o), and folding was the correct decision then too.\n\n**Position Consideration:**\n- UTG is the worst position - I have 4 players behind me\n- With a weak hand like J6o, there's a high probability someone behind me has a better hand\n- I could easily get raised and have to fold, losing 8 chips\n\n**Stack Size:**\n- 26.8 BB is a decent stack but not deep enough to speculate with weak hands\n- I need to preserve my chips for better spots\n- The 8 chip call represents about 3.7% of my stack - not huge, but it's wasted chips on a hand with very low equity\n\n**Tournament Strategy:**\n- Early in a tournament (hand #48), I should play tight from early position\n- J6o is well below my UTG opening range\n- Even if I hit a J, I'll often be outkicked\n- If I hit a 6, it's rarely going to be good enough\n\nThe correct play is to fold this hand from UTG position. It's a clear fold based on basic poker fundamentals.",

I see they frequently make min-raises (16 chips when the big blind is 8). This is their 6th preflop raise, and they seem to be raising with various amounts but often min-raising. Without showdown information, I can't tell if they're tight or loose.\n\n**Hand strength**: K2 offsuit is very weak. I only have a King high with a terrible kicker. Even if I hit a King on the flop, I'll be dominated by any other King with a better kicker. The 2 doesn't help much. This is a hand I should fold almost always.\n\n**Tournament considerations**: While 8 chips is only 1 BB, and I'm getting decent pot odds, I need to consider:\n1. If I call, I'll be out of position postflop\n2. My hand has very poor equity against any reasonable raising range\n3. I could lose more chips postflop if I hit a King and get trapped\n4. Even though I have a decent stack, I shouldn't waste chips on marginal situations\n\nThe only argument for calling is the pot odds (3.5:1) and that it's only 1 BB more. But K2 offsuit is just too weak. If the raise was from a very loose player who raises wide, I might consider it, but I don't have enough information to confirm that.\n\nI should fold this hand.

It's offsuit, low cards, and not well connected (3-gap). This is a fold in most situations.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is excellent position, but that doesn't make up for such a weak hand.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: The SB (Seat 2) has shown aggression with raises, but they're short-stacked. The BB is unknown but has a medium stack.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Need to call 8 to win 12 (1.5:1). Not great odds for a hand this weak.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 25.2 BB, I have a healthy stack. I shouldn't be risking chips with marginal hands. I can wait for better spots.\n\n**Conclusion**: Fold. This hand is simply too weak to play even from the button. The pot odds aren't compelling, and I don't want to get involved with such a weak holding. I should preserve my chips for better opportunities.",

J9o from UTG is too weak, especially:\n1. Out of position for the entire hand\n2. Dominated by many hands that will call/raise\n3. No strong postflop playability\n4. Tournament poker requires tighter play from early position\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot, preferably with a stronger hand or better position.",

Hand strength: Th 6d is trash. It's offsuit, low cards, not connected enough for straight potential\n2. Position: I'm in SB, so I'll be out of position postflop\n3. Opponent: GPT-OSS-120B has been extremely tight, folding 9 straight hands. A 3x raise from them likely means a premium hand (AA, KK, QQ, AK, etc.)\n4. Pot odds: 20 to win 36 = 1.8:1, which is not enough for this hand\n5. Tournament: I have a healthy stack and no need to gamble with trash\n\nThis is an easy fold.

It has some straight potential but is dominated by many hands. From UTG, this is definitely a fold.\n\n2. **Position**: UTG is the worst position - I have 4 players to act behind me. This is a clear fold situation with a marginal hand.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 202 chips (25.2 BB), which is a healthy stack. No need to get involved with marginal hands.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for the player in Seat 2 (Kimi-K2), they have been fairly tight - folding most hands and only raising occasionally (hands 52 and 53). This suggests they play relatively tight, making it even less attractive to play a marginal hand against them.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 chips. While the pot odds aren't bad (12:8 or 1.5:1), this is not a hand I want to play from UTG.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 25 BB, I should be selective and preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nThis is a clear fold. I don't need to use any more tools - the decision is straightforward based on basic poker fundamentals.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The opponent Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has made a large raise of 113 chips, which is a significant portion of their stack (they had 113 chips and went all-in). Looking at their preflop raise history, they typically raise much smaller amounts (12-24 chips). This large raise suggests they likely have a very strong hand.\n\nI have Tc 2c, which is a very weak hand - a low suited connector but offsuit. Even though it's suited, it's still a trash hand. \n\nKey considerations:\n1. My hand is extremely weak - T2 offsuit\n2. I'm facing a large all-in raise from an opponent who normally raises much smaller\n3. I need to call 105 chips into a pot of 238, so pot odds are about 2.26:1\n4. The opponent went all-in with 113 chips, which is unusual for them\n5. DeepSeek-V3.2 called the raise with their short stack of 31 chips\n6. I'm on the button which is good position, but that doesn't matter much when facing an all-in\n7. My stack is 194 chips, so calling would cost me more than half my stack\n\nGiven the opponent's betting pattern history (small raises usually, now a massive all-in), this strongly suggests they have a premium hand like AA, KK, QQ, or AK. T2 offsuit has very poor equity against any of these hands.\n\nEven though the pot odds might seem tempting (calling 105 to win 238), my hand equity is likely less than 20% against their range, making this a clear fold.\n\nI should fold here.",

My tens are likely ahead but vulnerable. I need to charge draws and protect my hand. A bet of about 2/3 to 3/4 pot seems appropriate.\n\nPot is 48, so a bet of 32-36 chips would be good. This charges flush draws (which need about 4:1 odds) and straight draws.\n\nLet me bet 32 chips (about 2/3 pot).",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Hand Situation:**\n- I have Ts Td (pocket tens)\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- My stack: 138 chips (17.2 BB)\n- Board: 5c 4h 9c 5s\n- Pot: 112 chips\n- It's the turn, and I have the option to check or raise\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- I have pocket tens, which is a strong hand\n- The board shows: 5c 4h 9c 5s (pair of 5s, with clubs and hearts)\n- I currently have an overpair (my tens are higher than any board card)\n- There are potential draws: straight draws (6-7-8, 6-7-9, etc.) and club flush draw\n- However, the 5s is a relatively safe card - it pairs the board, which is generally good for an overpair\n\n**Opponent analysis (DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nLooking at the opponent's history:\n- They tend to fold preflop quite often (many folds in hands 47, 49, 50, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57)\n- When they do play, they can be aggressive postflop (hand 46: bet 24 on flop, called turn 24, called river 48)\n- In hand 48: called preflop, bet on flop\n- In hand 58: called preflop but folded\n- In hand 59: called a large bet preflop (113 chips)\n\n**Current action:**\n- Preflop: I raised to 24, they called 16\n- Flop: I bet 32, they called 32\n- Turn: I can check or raise\n\nThe opponent called my flop bet, which could mean:\n1. They have a hand they're continuing with (pair, draw, etc.)\n2. They're floating with a plan to bluff later\n3. They have a monster and are trapping\n\n**My position:**\n- I'm on the button with an overpair\n- The pot is already 112 chips, which is significant relative to my 138 stack\n- I have about 1.2x pot left in my stack\n\n**Decision factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: I have an overpair to the board, which is strong but vulnerable\n2. **Board texture**: The paired board (5s) reduces the chance someone has trips (they'd need a 5)\n3. **Opponent tendencies**: They can be aggressive postflop and have called two streets\n4. **Stack sizes**: I have 138 left, pot is 112. A raise commits me to the pot\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I'm relatively short-stacked at 17.2 BB\n\nGiven that:\n- I have an overpair\n- The board paired, which is generally good for overpairs\n- My opponent has shown they can call and bet aggressively\n- I'm short-stacked and this is a good spot to get chips in\n- Checking might give a free card to draws\n\nI think the best play is to bet/raise here for value and protection. Since I can check or raise, and there's 0 to call, I should make a value bet.\n\nThe minimum raise is 32, but that seems small given the pot size (112). I should make a substantial bet to:\n1. Get value from worse hands\n2. Charge draws\n3. Set up a river decision\n\nGiven my stack of 138 and pot of 112, a bet of around 60-80 seems appropriate. This would leave me with 58-78 chips on the river.\n\nLet me make a bet of 80 chips, which is about 70% of the pot - a solid value bet that charges draws and gets value from worse pairs.",

Seems relatively tight but will defend with some hands. Called a 113 chip bet in hand 59, so not afraid to call with decent hands.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): Very tight! Has folded almost every hand in the recent data. Only raised once in hand 50, otherwise folding consistently. This suggests they defend their blind very selectively.\n\n**Position and Stack Considerations:**\n- I'm on the button, which is the best position post-flop\n- With 15.6 BB, I'm in the \"danger zone\" but not desperate yet\n- This is a good spot to try to steal blinds, especially against tight opponents\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- Q5 offsuit is a marginal hand at best\n- However, against two tight opponents who fold a lot, this could be a good stealing opportunity\n- If called, I'll have position and a decent high card\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Need to call 16 to win 24 (1.5:1)\n- Not great odds for this hand if I were just calling\n- But as a potential steal attempt, the math is different\n\n**Decision:**\nWith two tight opponents (especially MiniMax-M2 who folds BB constantly), and being on the button with a decent stack size for a steal attempt, I should raise here. A standard raise would be 2.5-3x the BB, so around 40-48 chips. \n\nLet me raise to 48 chips (3x BB) to put pressure on the blinds. This is a good stealing spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **My hand**: Qs 5h - I have a backdoor flush draw (spades) but no pair. This is a very weak hand on a 9s 8s 3d board.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN, which is good position.\n\n3. **Action**: I raised preflop to 48 chips, and Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called. On the flop, they bet 32 into a 136 chip pot.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 to win 168 (136 + 32), which is about 19% pot odds.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Looking at the recall data for Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2):\n   - They fold preflop very frequently (many folds)\n   - When they do play, they seem to call and bet postflop (as in hand #46)\n   - They called my preflop raise, which suggests they have some strength\n   - They showed down with Ace-high hands in the past (Ad-8h, Ad-5d, Ad-Qd)\n\n6. **Board texture**: 9s 8s 3d - This is a coordinated board with a flush draw. My Qs gives me a backdoor flush draw, but I'm behind any pair, any 9 or 8, and any spade draw.\n\n7. **Stack considerations**: I have 202 chips (12.6 BB). This is a short stack but not desperate yet.\n\n8. **The bet**: The opponent bet 32, which is less than 1/4 pot. This could be:\n   - A weak bet with a marginal hand\n   - A probe bet with a draw\n   - A value bet with a strong hand\n\nGiven that they called my preflop raise, they could have:\n- Pocket pairs (22-QQ)\n- 9x hands\n- 8x hands\n- Spade draws\n- Overcards\n\nMy hand has very little equity here. I have:\n- 6 outs to a pair (3 Queens, 3 Fives) - but even if I hit, I might not be good\n- Backdoor spade draw (need running spades)\n\nThe pot odds are decent (19%), but my hand equity is likely much lower. Even with two overcards, I'd only have about 24% equity, but I only have one overcard (the Queen).\n\nGiven the opponent's tendency to call preflop raises and bet postflop, they likely have something here. My Q-high is very weak on this board. I should fold.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. The opponent bet small (32 into 136). This could be a weak bet. I have position. Maybe I could float here and try to take it away on the turn if they check. But with my stack size, I don't have much room to maneuver.\n\nLet me think about the math:\n- If I call 32, pot becomes 200\n- I'll have 154 left\n- Turn card comes, if they check, I could bet and potentially take it down\n\nBut this is risky. My hand has very little equity. The opponent has shown they can bet multiple streets (hand #46). \n\nI think the best play is to fold. I don't have enough equity to call, and I'm out of position for the rest of the hand despite being on the button (since the opponent will act first). My stack is too valuable to waste on a Q-high with no real draw.\n\nWait, I am on the button, so I have position. But still, my hand is too weak. I should fold.",

Q4 offsuit is not a good starting hand in any position.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - This is the best position, but with such a weak hand, position advantage is limited.\n\n**Stack**: 202 chips (12.6 BB) - I'm in the middle stack range, not desperate yet but need to be careful.\n\n**Current situation**: \n- Blinds are 8/16\n- I posted SB of 8\n- Pot is 24 \n- I need to call 8 more to see the flop (getting 3:1 pot odds)\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 is in BB with 201 chips\n\n**Opponent analysis**: Let me look at DeepSeek-V3.2's tendencies:\n- Recent actions show they fold preflop often (hands 57, 58, 61, 63)\n- They do call sometimes (hands 58, 59, 60)\n- They raised once in hand 62 to 40 chips\n- They seem relatively tight/passive\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: Q4 offsuit is very weak. Even with position, this hand has poor equity.\n2. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24 (3:1). With such a weak hand, this isn't enough.\n3. **Implied odds**: Very low with Q4. Even if I hit a Q, I could be dominated by better kickers.\n4. **Tournament situation**: With 12.6 BB, I should be selective. Q4 offsuit is not a hand to invest chips with.\n5. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 seems tight, but even against a tight player, Q4 is too weak.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is an easy fold. Q4 offsuit from any position is a fold, especially with a medium stack where I need to preserve chips for better spots. The 8 chip call might seem small, but it's 0.5 BB and those chips add up. Better to wait for a stronger hand or a better situation.\n\nI should fold here.",

It has almost no straight potential (only 4-5 makes a straight), no flush potential, and very low pair potential. This is a clear fold in virtually all situations.\n\n**Position:**\nUTG is the worst position to play a weak hand from. If I call or raise, I'll be out of position against everyone else at the table for the entire hand.\n\n**Stack Size:**\nAt 12.6 BB, I'm in the danger zone but not critically short yet. However, I need to preserve my chips for better spots. With a hand this weak, I should definitely fold.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2: Mixes calls and folds, occasionally raises. Seems somewhat loose but not overly aggressive.\n- MiniMax-M2: Very tight preflop, folds most hands. Only called once in the sample.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Mix of raises and folds, but mostly folds recently. Seems to be playing tight.\n\nEven if the opponents are playing tight, 2-3 offsuit is still a clear fold UTG.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nWith 12.6 BB, I need to be selective. I should wait for a much better hand or situation. Playing 2-3 offsuit UTG would be a waste of chips.\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is an easy fold. The hand has very little equity, I'm out of position, and I have a short stack that needs to be preserved.",

They raised to 40 here which is unusual for them.\n- **MiniMax-M2**: More active, has made several preflop raises. They've been folding a lot recently but re-raised here.\n\n**Stack considerations:**\n- I have 186 chips (11.6 BB) - this is getting short\n- I need to be selective with my spots\n- The pot is already 128 chips, which is about 69% of my stack\n\n**Action analysis:**\n- Amount to call: 48 chips (about 26% of my stack)\n- This would put me at 138 chips left\n- If I call, pot would be 176 chips\n- I'm out of position postflop\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. Q8o is too weak to call a 3-bet (effectively) from MiniMax-M2, especially when:\n1. I'm out of position\n2. The raise shows real strength\n3. I have a marginal hand with poor equity\n4. I need to preserve my tournament life with 11.6 BB\n\nEven though the pot odds might seem tempting (48 to win 128 = 2.67:1), my hand doesn't play well against their likely range, and being out of position makes it even worse.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

It doesn't play well against a raising range.

Tournament chip accumulation is critical at this stack depth.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My Hand**: Q\u2660 A\u2663 - This is a premium hand, very strong preflop.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Best position, acting last postflop.\n\n**Stack**: 178 chips (11.1 BB) - This is a relatively short stack in tournament play. Short enough that I need to be thinking about getting all my chips in with strong hands.\n\n**Blinds**: 8/16\n**Pot**: 24 chips\n**Amount to call**: 16 (1 BB)\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): SB, 410 chips. Looking at their history:\n  - They fold a lot preflop (hands 61, 63, 65, 66, 68)\n  - When they do raise, they raise to 40 (2.5x BB in hand 62, 67)\n  - In hand 67, they raised to 40, called a 3-bet to 64, then bet aggressively on flop and turn (75, 78)\n  - Overall: Tight-aggressive when they enter pots\n\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): BB, 188 chips. Looking at their history:\n  - Generally tight, folds often preflop (hands 63, 64, 68)\n  - In hand 66, they just called SB (8 chips) and checked down to fold on turn\n  - In hand 67, they made a big 3-bet to 64 (4x BB), then called flop and turn bets\n  - Overall: Also tight, but capable of big raises with strong hands\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. **Hand strength**: AQ is a premium hand, especially on the button. It's definitely strong enough to raise with.\n\n2. **Position**: Being on the BTN is excellent - I'll act last postflop.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - My stack: 178 (11.1 BB) - Short but not desperate yet\n   - DeepSeek: 410 (25.6 BB) - Big stack\n   - MiniMax: 188 (11.75 BB) - Similar to mine\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 11 BB, I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips. AQ on the button is a great spot. I could:\n   - Call: Keeps pot small, but wastes opportunity with a strong hand\n   - Raise: Standard play, builds pot with best hand\n   - All-in: Given my short stack, this could be a good move. It maximizes fold equity and gets value when called.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents are relatively tight. If I shove:\n   - DeepSeek might fold many hands, only calling with premium pairs, AK\n   - MiniMax might also fold a lot from BB\n   - With AQ, I'm likely ahead of their calling ranges, and when they fold I win 24 chips (1.5 BB) uncontested\n\n6. **Pot odds**: Pot is 24, I need to call 16. If I just call, I'm getting 1.5:1 immediate odds, but that's not the main consideration here.\n\n**Decision**: With AQ on the button and a short stack (11 BB), the best play is to go all-in. This maximizes fold equity and gets value from my strong hand. If called, I'm likely in decent shape against their ranges, and I need to accumulate chips to stay alive in the tournament.\n\nThe standard raise would be to 32 (2x BB minimum), but with my stack size, a standard raise would commit about 18% of my stack. If I get any action, I'll likely be pot-committed anyway. Going all-in now gives me maximum fold equity.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 178,\n  \"reasoning\": \"AQ is a premium hand on the button. With 11 BB stack, going all-in maximizes fold equity against tight opponents while getting value from a strong hand. Fold equity + tournament chip accumulation makes shoving the optimal play.\"\n}",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- Position: UTG (early position)\n- Cards: 8s 5s (unsuited connectors, very weak)\n- Stack: 202 chips (12.6 BB)\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n8\u2660 5\u2660 is a very weak hand, especially from UTG position. It's not connected in a meaningful way (gap between 5 and 8), and from early position we should be playing very tight.\n\n**Position considerations:**\n- UTG is the worst position preflop (first to act)\n- With 12.6 BB, I'm in short stack territory\n- I need to be very selective with hands\n\n**Opponent observations from recent hands:**\nFrom the recall, I can see:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been folding preflop recently (hands 68, 69)\n- GPT-OSS-120B made a raise in hand 68 but folded in hand 69\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 has been folding preflop recently (hands 68, 69)\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 was aggressive postflop in hand 67 with big bets\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- With 12.6 BB, I'm in the danger zone but not desperate yet\n- I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call\n- From UTG, I need a premium hand to play\n- 8\u2660 5\u2660 is way too weak to play from this position with this stack size\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is an easy fold. 8-5 offsuit from UTG with a short stack is a clear fold. I don't have the chips to speculate, and this hand has very little potential even if I hit something. I should preserve my chips for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"8-5 offsuit from UTG with 12.6 BB is far too weak.

King-high with a decent kicker.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is the best position in poker. I get to act last on every street after the flop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 186 chips (11.6 BB), which is a short-to-medium stack. I need to be careful with my chips but also look for spots to accumulate.\n\n4. **Opponent action**: GPT-OSS-120B in the SB has completed the blind (called 8). This is a relatively weak action - they just called rather than raising.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: From the recall, I can see:\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been quite active preflop with many folds but also several raises (hands 55, 56, 58, 68, 70)\n   - They raised to 148 in hand 70 (big raise)\n   - They seem to be playing somewhat aggressively when they do enter pots\n   - They've folded a lot, suggesting they might be selective\n\n6. **Pot odds**: The pot is 32 chips and it costs me 0 to check (since the SB just completed). I have a free flop with a decent hand in position.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 11.6 BB, I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips, but I don't need to force anything. Getting a free flop with KTo on the button is a good opportunity to see if I hit something.\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm on the button with position\n- It costs me nothing to see the flop\n- I have a hand with decent potential (KTo can make top pair, straight draws)\n- The opponent just completed the blind, showing weakness\n\nI should definitely check and see a free flop. There's no reason to raise here - if I raise, I'm bloating the pot with a marginal hand and could face resistance. Checking allows me to:\n1. See the flop for free\n2. Keep the pot small with a marginal hand\n3. Use my position to make better decisions post-flop\n4. Preserve my stack while still having a chance to win chips\n\nI should NOT fold because I'm getting a free look at the flop with a decent hand in the best position.",

The board is 6-3-5 rainbow, which is a low, disconnected board.\n\nPot odds: 48 to win 128 (80+48) = 1:2.67 or about 37.5% equity needed.\n\nGiven this is a tournament with 11.6 BB stack, and I'm facing a large flop bet (3x the preflop pot), I should consider:\n1. My hand is weak - just King-high\n2. I'm likely behind any pair\n3. I have some backdoor draws but they're weak\n4. Tournament survival is important with this stack size\n\nLet me think about opponent tendencies. Since I don't have specific info, I need to make a general assessment. A bet of 48 into 80 is a strong bet, suggesting they have something.\n\nWith K-high on a low board, I'm likely behind. The pot odds aren't great for a pure bluff catcher. I should probably fold and preserve my stack.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. I have position, and this could be a continuation bet from the SB who just called preflop. They could have a wide range. But the bet size is large (60% of pot), which suggests strength.\n\nGiven my stack size of 11.6 BB, preserving chips is crucial. Folding seems correct here.",

It's not a premium hand by any means.\n\n**Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN) which is the best position in poker. I get to act last postflop.\n\n**Stack**: I have 178 chips which is 11.1 big blinds. This is a short stack but not desperate yet.\n\n**Pot**: 24 chips (8 from SB, 16 from BB)\n\n**Action**: Everyone folded to me. I need to call 8 more to see the flop (completing my SB), or I can raise to at least 32.\n\n**Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 is the BB with 378 chips (23.6 BB). Looking at their recent actions:\n- Hand 67: They raised preflop to 40, then called 24 more, then bet 75 on flop and 78 on turn (showing aggression)\n- Hand 70: They called 16 preflop then folded\n- Hands 66, 68, 69, 71: They folded preflop\n\nSo DeepSeek-V3.2 seems to be playing relatively tight but capable of aggression when they enter pots.\n\n**Decision factors**:\n1. **Hand strength**: 9-7 offsuit is weak. I have no pair, no suited connectors, not even connected cards.\n2. **Position**: Being on the Button is great, but with a weak hand and short stack, position advantage is limited.\n3. **Stack size**: At 11.1 BB, I should be thinking about push/fold territory soon, but I can still make a small call here.\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 8 to win 24, which is 3:1 pot odds. This is attractive, but with such a weak hand, even good pot odds don't justify it.\n5. **Tournament life**: With 11.1 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. This is a very marginal hand.\n\n**Recommendation**: Fold. 9-7 offsuit is just too weak to play even from the button with a short stack. I should wait for a better hand or a better spot to steal blinds. The 3:1 pot odds aren't enough to justify playing this hand, and I don't want to get involved with a weak hand that could cost me more chips postflop.\n\nEven though I'm getting good pot odds (3:1), 9-7 offsuit is just too weak. The best play here is to fold and wait for a better spot.",

          "content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - Excellent position\n- Cards: 4h 4c (pocket 4s) - Small pocket pair\n- Stack: 178 chips (11.1 BB) - Short stack\n- Blinds: 8/16\n- Pot: 24 chips\n- To call: 16 chips\n- Minimum raise: 32 chips\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (SB): Has been folding a lot preflop (folded in hands 66, 68, 69, 71). Made a big raise in hand 67 (40 chips) and called 24, then bet heavily on flop and turn. Seems to play strong hands aggressively but folds frequently.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): Has been folding almost every hand (folded in hands 68, 69, 70, 71, 72). Only played hand 67 where they made a big preflop raise (64 chips) and called flop and turn bets. Very tight player.\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: Pocket 4s is a marginal hand. It's a small pair that will rarely be good if it doesn't hit a set (which happens ~12% of the time on the flop).\n\n2. **Position**: Button is great position, but with a short stack and being first to act after the blinds, this advantage is diminished.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: 11.1 BB is short-stacked. Tournament survival is important, but I need to accumulate chips. With a small pair, the standard play is often to shove or fold when this short.\n\n4. **Opponent Tendencies**: Both opponents are very tight and fold frequently preflop. This suggests:\n   - They may fold to aggression\n   - When they call/raise, they likely have strong hands\n   - They give up their blinds often\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: Calling 16 to win 24 = 40% of pot. Not great odds for a small pair that will rarely hit.\n\n6. **Raise/Fold/Call Options**:\n   - **Fold**: Safe, preserves 11.1 BB stack\n   - **Call**: Not great - investing 16 chips (1 BB) with a hand that will likely miss\n   - **Raise**: Could steal blinds from tight players. Minimum raise is 32, which is ~1.8 BB. \n   \nThe key insight is that I'm on the button with a short stack (11.1 BB) and both opponents are very tight, folding frequently. Pocket pairs are classic \"shove or fold\" hands when you're short-stacked. \n\nGiven that both players fold often, this is a good spot to try to steal the blinds. However, a min-raise to 32 leaves me with 146 chips if called, which is still playable. But if I'm going to raise with a small pair this short, I should probably just shove all-in.\n\n**All-in considerations:**\n- 178 chips is 11.1 BB\n- The blinds total 24 chips\n- An all-in shove gives maximum fold equity\n- Against two tight players, this has a good chance of success\n- If called, I have ~50% equity against most non-pair hands, and I'm dominated by higher pairs\n\nGiven the tightness of both opponents and my short stack, this is a good spot to shove all-in and try to pick up the blinds. The risk/reward is favorable.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Pocket 4s is not a great hand to shove with from the button. It's better to shove with hands that have better equity when called, like suited connectors, Ax, or Kx. Pocket 4s is often dominated when called.\n\nMaybe I should just fold and wait for a better spot. With 11.1 BB, I still have some time, and I can find better hands to shove with.\n\nActually, looking at the opponent data again:\n- DeepSeek-V3.2: 10 actions, mostly folds, one aggressive play in hand 67\n- MiniMax-M2: 10 actions, 5 folds in a row (68-72), only played hand 67\n\nBoth are extremely tight. A raise could easily steal the blinds. But what size?\n\nIf I raise to 32 (min-raise), I'm risking 32 to win 24. That's not a great risk/reward ratio.\n\nIf I shove 178 to win 24, I'm risking a lot to win a little.\n\nThe best play might actually be to **fold**. Here's why:\n- Pocket 4s is a weak hand that doesn't play well post-flop unless it hits a set\n- I'm out of position relative to the blinds post-flop\n- With 11.1 BB, I should be selective and wait for better spots\n"

This is a decent speculative hand that can make straights and flushes, but it's not strong enough to play from early position with a short stack.\n\n2. Position: I'm UTG (first to act), which is the worst position. With 4 players still to act behind me, I need a much stronger hand to open from this position.\n\n3. Stack size: I have 202 chips (12.6 BB), which is a short stack. With a short stack, I should be playing tighter and looking for spots to get my money in with strong hands, not speculative hands.\n\n4. My recent history: Looking at my hand history, I can see I've been playing quite tight (57 folds out of 73 hands). This is appropriate for tournament play. I've had some success with strong hands like TT (hand 60), AQs (hand 69), and 44 (hand 73) when I raised.\n\n5. Tournament considerations: With 12.6BB, I need to be careful about bleeding chips. Calling 16 chips from UTG with a speculative hand would be a mistake. If I hit the flop, I might not get paid enough to justify the risk, and if I miss, I've wasted 8% of my stack.\n\n6. The hand is suited, which adds some value, but from UTG with a short stack, this is a clear fold.\n\nThe correct play here is to fold. I should wait for a better spot, preferably in better position or with a stronger hand, especially given my short stack size.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this preflop situation:\n\n**My hand:** A7o (Ace of hearts, 7 of hearts) - Ace-rag offsuit, but suited\n\n**Position:** UTG (first to act) - very early position\n\n**Stack:** 226 chips (14.1 BB) - relatively short stack, in the danger zone\n\n**Blinds:** 8/16\n\n**Pot:** 24 chips\n\n**Amount to call:** 16\n\n**Legal actions:** fold, call, raise\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength:** A7o is a marginal hand, especially from UTG. While it's suited, it's still very weak. From early position, we should be playing a very tight range.\n\n2. **Position:** UTG is the worst position - we'll be out of position postflop against everyone. This means we need a much stronger hand to play.\n\n3. **Stack size:** 14.1 BB is getting short. We're in \"push/fold\" territory, meaning we should either go all-in or fold preflop. Calling is generally bad with a short stack because it commits chips without maximizing fold equity.\n\n4. **Opponents:** I have 3 active opponents with varying stack sizes. I should be looking for spots to accumulate chips or preserve my stack.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations:** With 14.1 BB, I need to be thinking about survival and finding good spots to shove. A7o from UTG is not a good shoving hand, especially with 3 players behind me who could have me dominated (AX hands that beat me).\n\n6. **Pot odds:** I'm getting 24:16 or 1.5:1 pot odds to call, which would require ~40% equity. Even against random hands, A7o doesn't have that kind of equity multiway, and from UTG we're likely against stronger ranges.\n\n**Conclusion:** This is a clear fold. A7o is too weak to play from UTG with a short stack. I should preserve my chips for a better spot - ideally when I'm in later position or have a stronger hand that I can shove with.",

In Hand 76, GPT-OSS-120B made the exact same raise sizing (148 chips) from the small blind. This is almost certainly a pattern. The fact that they folded several times and then use this exact sizing suggests it's a strong hand or a bluff sizing they like to use.\n\n**Hand strength:** 2c 9d is garbage. One of the worst hands in poker. Offsuit, no connectivity, low cards.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 132 to win 164, which is about 1.24:1. I need about 45% equity to justify a call. With 2c 9d, I likely have around 30-35% equity against a typical raising range, and probably less given this specific sizing pattern.\n\n**Tournament situation:** I have 13.1 BB. If I call 132, I'll be left with only 78 chips (4.9 BB), which is critically short. I'd be pot-committed and in terrible shape. \n\n**Position:** I'm on the Button, which is good, but with this hand it doesn't matter much.\n\n**Decision:** This is a clear fold. \n\n1. My hand is extremely weak\n\n\n2. The opponent's consistent raise sizing hints at a deliberate strategy\n3. Calling would severely compromise my tournament life\n4. The potential return doesn't justify the significant chip risk\n5. Preserving my current stack is more valuable than chasing an unlikely pot\n\nThe strategic move is to fold and wait for a stronger hand.",

It's suited, which gives some potential for flushes.\n- However, it's a very weak hand overall - J5 suited is not a hand you typically want to play, especially with a short stack.\n\n**Position:**\n- I'm on the button, which is great position. I get to act last postflop.\n- This gives me more information and control.\n\n**Stack Size:**\n- I have 12.6 BB, which is a short stack in tournament poker.\n- With a short stack, I need to be selective about which hands I play.\n- I should generally look for spots to either fold or go all-in, avoiding marginal calls that commit too much of my stack.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data on DeepSeek-V3.2:\n- They fold a LOT preflop (many fold actions)\n- They occasionally raise (hands 62, 67, 78)\n- When they do raise, they tend to bet postflop aggressively (hand 67 they bet flop and turn)\n- They seem to be relatively tight-aggressive\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- I need to call 8 chips to win 24 chips = 3:1 pot odds\n- This is decent pot odds, but with my hand strength and stack size, this isn't the key factor.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- With 12.6 BB, I'm in the danger zone.\n- I should be looking for spots to either fold or shove all-in, not make small calls that commit me.\n- J5s is not strong enough to call or raise here.\n- Even though I have position, the hand is too weak to play with a short stack.\n\n**Decision:**\nI should fold. J5s is too weak to play with a short stack, even from the button. I need to preserve my chips for a better spot where I can either shove all-in preflop with a stronger hand or have better postflop potential. Calling 8 chips (0.5 BB) might seem small, but it's 4% of my stack on a very marginal hand. With my short stack, I need to be more disciplined and wait for better opportunities.",

While I have fold equity, getting called leaves me in terrible shape. Better to preserve 170 chips (5.3 BB) and wait for a stronger hand or better spot to shove.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - best position\n- Cards: Jc 5c - suited but very weak hand\n- Stack: 202 chips (6.3 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- To call: 32 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Opponents:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (SB): 386 chips - has been folding a lot preflop (8 folds in last 10 hands), but did raise once. Seems tight.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): 156 chips - has been very tight, folding most hands, only called twice in hand #74\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: J5s is a very weak hand. Even suited, it's not a good hand to play, especially with a short stack.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button which is good, but with 6.3 BB, position matters less.\n\n3. **Stack size**: At 6.3 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I should either shove all-in or fold. Calling is terrible with this stack size.\n\n4. **Opponent tendencies**: Both opponents are tight. DeepSeek has folded 8/10 times preflop. MiniMax has folded 8/10 times. This suggests they might fold to an all-in.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is 48, I need to call 32. That's 1.5:1 pot odds, but with J5s that's not relevant.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With 6.3 BB, I need to make a move soon. The button is a good spot. Both opponents are tight and might fold. If I shove:\n   - DeepSeek needs to call 186 more into a pot of 234 (48+186), getting about 1.26:1 odds\n   - MiniMax needs to call 186 more into a pot of 250 (48+186+32), getting about 1.34:1 odds\n\n7. **ICM considerations**: With such a short stack, I need to accumulate chips or bust. Folding here leaves me with 170 chips (5.3 BB), still in terrible shape.\n\n**Decision**: This is a classic spot for a button shove with a short stack. J5s is not great, but:\n- I'm on the button\n- Both opponents are tight\n- I have fold equity\n- My stack is desperate\n- The suited cards give me some extra equity if called\n\nI should shove all-in for 202 chips.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The minimum raise is 64, but I can raise to any amount up to my stack. With 202 chips, I should go all-in since I'm in push/fold mode.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. With J5s, even from the button with tight opponents, this is a marginal shove at best. The equity is poor if called. \n\nBut with 6.3 BB, I need to take spots. The fold equity against two tight players might make this +EV. \n\nLet me calculate: If both fold 70% of the time (reasonable given their stats), and when called I have ~30% equity against their calling range, this could be profitable.\n\nActually, I think the better play is to fold. J5s is just too weak. Even with fold equity, if I get called I'm in terrible shape. I'd rather wait for a better spot, even with a short stack. There will be better hands to shove with than J5s.\n\nLet me reconsider one more time. At 6.3 BB on the button with two tight players... this is actually a decent shove spot. J5s has some suited connectivity. The fold equity is significant. \n\nBut I think the disciplined play is to fold and wait for a better hand. With 6.3 BB I can still wait for something like any ace, any pair, or two broadway cards. J5s is just too weak.\n\n**Final decision**: Fold. Preserve my stack for a better spot. J5s is not worth risking my tournament life on, even with fold equity.",

I'm in \"push/fold\" territory, meaning I should either go all-in or fold. I don't have enough chips to make any other play meaningful.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 chips to see a flop. With 202 chips total, calling would commit 16% of my stack with a terrible hand.\n\n5. **Opponent tendencies**: From the limited data I have, MiniMax-M2 in seat 4 has been fairly aggressive (raised preflop in hand 81, then bet flop and turn). DeepSeek-V3.2 has been more passive/calling station type.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With only 6.3 BB, I need to be very selective. I should wait for a much better spot - ideally a premium hand or at least something with some connectivity/suitedness. T3o is one of the worst hands in poker.\n\n**Decision**: This is a clear fold. I cannot justify putting 16% of my stack into the pot with T3o from UTG. I need to preserve my chips for a better opportunity.",

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Hand:**\n- Position: BTN (Button)\n- Cards: 9c 4h (offsuit, very weak hand)\n- Stack: 202 chips (6.3 BB) - very short stacked\n- Blinds: 16/32 (big blind is 32)\n- Pot: 76 chips\n- Amount to call: 16 (half of big blind)\n- Legal actions: fold, call, raise\n\n**Players:**\n- Seat 1 (me): 202 chips\n- Seat 2: 0 chips (folded)\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): 498 chips (big blind)\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 0 chips (out)\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B): 188 chips (folded)\n\n**Action so far:**\n- I posted SB (16)\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 posted BB (32)\n- Seat 4 called 28 (this seems odd - they should be calling 32 if they're in a position to call, or maybe they limped for 28? Let me re-read... Actually, looking at the action: Seat 4 call 28 - this might be a typo or they called the BB of 32 but it's showing as 28 for some reason. Let me assume they called the big blind)\n\nWait, let me reconsider the action sequence:\n- preflop: Seat 1 post_sb 16 (me)\n- preflop: Seat 3 post_bb 32 (DeepSeek-V3.2)\n- preflop: Seat 4 call 28 (MiniMax-M2)\n- preflop: Seat 5 fold (GPT-OSS-120B)\n\nThis is confusing. If blinds are 16/32, and I posted SB of 16, and DeepSeek posted BB of 32, then the call amount should be 32, not 28. But it says \"Amount to call: 16\" for me.\n\nLet me reconsider: I'm in the SB position (Seat 1). I posted 16. The BB is 32. So to call, I need to put in an additional 16 to match the BB. That makes sense.\n\nSeat 4 (MiniMax-M2) called 28. This is weird. If they're calling the BB, it should be 32. Maybe they limped from another position? But the positions shown are: Seat 1 (me, BTN/SB), Seat 2 (folded), Seat 3 (BB), Seat 4, Seat 5.\n\nActually, with 5 players and me on the BTN, the positions would be:\n- Seat 1: BTN (me)\n- Seat 2: SB\n- Seat 3: BB\n- Seat 4: UTG\n- Seat 5: MP\n\nBut the action says I posted SB 16, and Seat 3 posted BB 32. So maybe the button is on Seat 0 or the positions are shifted? Let me not overthink this. The key facts are:\n- I'm in late position (BTN)\n- I have 9c 4h (trash hand)\n- I have a very short stack (6.3 BB)\n- There's 76 in the pot\n- It costs me 16 to call\n- One player (Seat 4) has called\n- One player (Seat 5) has folded\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recall data on DeepSeek-V3.2:\n- They fold a lot preflop (folded in hands 79, 82, 83)\n- In hand 81, they called preflop, then checked/called on flop, turn, and river (passive play)\n- They seem to be a relatively tight, passive player\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 9c 4h is a terrible hand. It's unsuited, unconnected, and low. Even with one caller, this hand has very little equity.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the button, which is good, but with this hand it's not enough to justify playing.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have only 6.3 BB. This is a critical tournament situation. With a stack this short, I need to be very selective and look for spots to shove or fold. Calling with a weak hand is not a good use of my limited chips.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: There's 76 in the pot, and it costs me 16 to call. That's 4.75:1 pot odds. This might seem attractive, but with 9-4 offsuit, even these odds don't justify calling. The hand has very poor playability post-flop.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: With 6.3 BB, I'm in \""

It's offsuit, not connected, and low. This is in the bottom 10% of starting hands.\n\n2. **Stack Size**: At 6.3 BB, I'm very short stacked. With a stack this short, I should be very selective and only play strong hands. Calling with marginal hands is a leak.\n\n3. **Pot Odds**: There are 76 chips in the pot and I need to call 16. That's about 4.75:1 pot odds. While these odds might seem decent, my hand equity is terrible. Even against random hands, 9-4 offsuit has very low equity.\n\n4. **Position**: I'm on the button which is good, but with this hand strength and stack size, position doesn't help enough.\n\n5. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 is in the BB. From the recall data, they seem to be a tight player who folds a lot preflop and plays passively postflop. However, even if they're weak, 9-4 offsuit is just too bad to play.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 6.3 BB, I need to preserve my chips for better spots. I should be looking to shove with decent hands or fold everything else. Calling 16 chips (about 8% of my stack) with a trash hand is not a good tournament play.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold. The hand is too weak, my stack is too short to waste chips on marginal spots, and I need to wait for a better opportunity to get my money in.\n\nWait, let me reconsider - the amount to call is 16, which is only half the BB. Since I already posted 16 as SB, I need to add 16 more to match the BB of 32. The pot is 76 (16 + 32 + 28 from the caller).\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The action says:\n- Seat 1 post_sb 16 (me)\n- Seat 3 post_bb 32\n- Seat 4 call 28\n- Seat 5 fold\n\nIf I need to call 16, that means the current bet to match is 32 (the BB), and I've already posted 16, so I need to add 16 more.\n\nThe pot would be: my 16 + BB 32 + Seat 4's 28 = 76. Wait, that doesn't add up if Seat 4 called the BB. If Seat 4 called the BB, they would have put in 32, not 28.\n\nMaybe the structure is different. Let me just go with what's given:\n- Pot: 76\n- To call: 16\n\nSo pot odds are 76:16 or 4.75:1.\n\nEven with these pot odds, 9-4 offsuit is just too weak. I should fold and preserve my short stack for a better opportunity.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. With a stack of only 6.3 BB, I'm in desperate shape. Could this be a spot to shove all-in?\n\nIf I shove 202 chips:\n- I'd be risking 202 to win 76\n- I'd give the BB and the caller a tough decision\n- With 9-4 offsuit, it's a pure bluff\n\nBut bluffing with 6.3 BB is generally not advisable. I should wait for a hand with some equity. \n\nFold is clearly the best option. I need to preserve my very short stack for a better spot.\n\nLet me write the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9c4h is an extremely weak hand. With only 6.3 BB remaining, I must preserve my short stack for better opportunities.

However, even if they're weak, 9-4 offsuit is just too bad to play.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 6.3 BB, I need to preserve my chips for better spots. I should be looking to shove with decent hands or fold everything else. Calling 16 chips (about 8% of my stack) with a trash hand is not a good tournament play.\n\n**Decision**: I should fold. The hand is too weak, my stack is too short to waste chips on marginal spots, and I need to wait for a better opportunity to get my money in.\n\nWait, let me reconsider - the amount to call is 16, which is only half the BB. Since I already posted 16 as SB, I need to add 16 more to match the BB of 32. The pot is 76 (16 + 32 + 28 from the caller).\n\nActually, let me think about this differently. The action says:\n- Seat 1 post_sb 16 (me)\n- Seat 3 post_bb 32\n- Seat 4 call 28\n- Seat 5 fold\n\nIf I need to call 16, that means the current bet to match is 32 (the BB), and I've already posted 16, so I need to add 16 more.\n\nThe pot would be: my 16 + BB 32 + Seat 4's 28 = 76. Wait, that doesn't add up if Seat 4 called the BB. If Seat 4 called the BB, they would have put in 32, not 28.\n\nMaybe the structure is different. Let me just go with what's given:\n- Pot: 76\n- To call: 16\n\nSo pot odds are 76:16 or 4.75:1.\n\nEven with these pot odds, 9-4 offsuit is just too weak. I should fold and preserve my short stack for a better opportunity.\n\nActually, let me reconsider one more time. With a stack of only 6.3 BB, I'm in desperate shape. Could this be a spot to shove all-in?\n\nIf I shove 202 chips:\n- I'd be risking 202 to win 76\n- I'd give the BB and the caller a tough decision\n- With 9-4 offsuit, it's a pure bluff\n\nBut bluffing with 6.3 BB is generally not advisable. I should wait for a hand with some equity. \n\nFold is clearly the best option. I need to preserve my very short stack for a better spot.\n\nLet me write the JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"9c4h is an extremely weak hand. With only 6.3 BB remaining, I must preserve my short stack for better opportunities. The pot odds of 4.75:1 are not sufficient to justify calling with this hand, and raising as a bluff would be too risky with my stack",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: T\u2665 7\u2660 - This is a weak offsuit hand with no suited connectivity and only a ten as a high card. This is definitely a folding hand from UTG.\n\n**Position**: UTG (Under the Gun) - This is the worst position preflop as I have to act first on every street. I need to play very tight from this position.\n\n**Stack**: 202 chips (6.3 BB) - I'm in the danger zone with less than 10 big blinds. This means I need to be looking for spots to shove all-in or fold. I cannot afford to call and then fold on later streets.\n\n**Blinds**: 16/32 - The blinds are getting high relative to my stack.\n\n**Pot**: 48 chips\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 3: DeepSeek-V3.2 - 486 chips (15 BB) - healthy stack\n- Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 56 chips (1.75 BB) - very short, desperate\n- Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 156 chips (4.9 BB) - also short\n\nFrom the opponent actions I recalled:\n- Recent hands show a lot of folding preflop from all opponents\n- MiniMax-M2 called 28 chips in hand #84 (when blinds were likely lower)\n- Generally seems like opponents are playing somewhat tight\n\n**Decision**: With T7o from UTG and only 6.3 BB, this is a clear fold. This hand is:\n1. Too weak to open-shove from UTG\n2. Not strong enough to call 32 chips (16% of my stack)\n3. Would leave me in terrible position post-flop if I call\n4. I need to preserve my chips for a much better spot\n\nI should wait for a better hand (any pocket pair, any Ace, any two Broadway cards, or suited connectors) before committing my chips, especially from early position.",

They can fold preflop but also make big bets when they have something.\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\nQ\u2665 5\u2666 is a marginal hand:\n- Offsuit\n- Not connected\n- Queen is decent but kicker is terrible\n- Not a good hand to play in general\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- I'm extremely short stacked at 5.8 BB\n- On the button with only BB to act\n- I need to make a move soon or blind out\n- Q5o is not a great hand, but given my stack size and position, I should consider shoving\n\n**Decision:**\nWith 5.8 BB on the button and only the BB left to act, this is actually a decent spot to shove all-in. Even with a marginal hand like Q5o, the fold equity plus the chance to win the blinds makes this profitable. \n\nIf I call, I see a flop but will be pot-committed anyway with my short stack. Better to take the aggressive action now.\n\nLet me shove all-in for 186 chips.",

All-in shove applies maximum pressure and gives me two ways to win: they fold or I have decent equity if called.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- Cards: 5h Ad (Ace with a weak kicker)\n- Stack: 234 chips (7.3 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- Amount to call: 32\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 3 (SB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 482 chips - has been fairly active, showing some raises and calls\n- Seat 4 (BB): MiniMax-M2 with 184 chips - has been somewhat tight but has raised in the past\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A5 offsuit is a decent hand, especially with an Ace. But the 5 kicker is weak. This hand plays better as a steal or all-in hand when short-stacked.\n\n2. **Stack size**: At 7.3 BB, I'm in the danger zone. I need to be looking for spots to either double up or steal blinds. Calling here would leave me with ~200 chips (6.25 BB), which doesn't improve my situation much.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - DeepSeek in SB: Has shown both folds and aggression. They called 32 chips in hand 81, raised to 96 in hand 86. They seem to defend their blind sometimes but also fold a lot.\n   - MiniMax in BB: Generally tighter but has shown some aggression. They raised to 64 in hand 81, called in other spots. They have a medium stack at 184 chips (5.75 BB).\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 7.3 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Calling 32 chips would commit ~14% of my stack with a marginal hand and I'd be out of position postflop (though I'm on the button, I'd act last preflop but the action goes SB, BB, then me postflop).\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Calling 32 to win 48 = 1.5:1 odds, which isn't great for A5o.\n\n6. **Best play**: Given my short stack and position, this is a good spot to either:\n   - Fold and wait for a better spot (preserve chips)\n   - Go all-in (234 chips) as a steal attempt, putting pressure on both opponents\n\nLooking at the opponent history:\n- MiniMax (BB) has shown they can fold to pressure (folded multiple times)\n- DeepSeek (SB) also folds frequently\n\nWith A5o on the button, this is a decent hand to shove with. It has blocker value (Ace blocks AA, AK, AQ, AJ) and decent equity against calling ranges.\n\nIf I shove 234 chips:\n- MiniMax would need to call 202 more (they have 184, so they'd be all-in)\n- DeepSeek would need to call 218 more (they have 482)\n\nGiven their stacks and that they'd both be at risk (especially MiniMax), I think there's a good chance they fold.\n\n**Decision**: Shove all-in with A5o from the button with 7.3 BB. This is a standard short-stack play to steal blinds and either double up or take down the pot uncontested.\n\nThe raise_to should be 234 (my total stack).",

DeepSeek-V3.2 has shown they can raise with strong hands and bet aggressively postflop. Folding maintains 186 chips (5.8 BB) for a better opportunity.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the opponent's history:\n\nDeepSeek-V3.2 has:\n- Folded a lot (hands 76, 77, 79, 82, 83, 85, 87, 88)\n- Made some raises (hands 78, 86)\n- Made a raise to 96 in hand 86, then called a re-raise, and bet big on the flop (192)\n- In hand 81, they called multiple times and played passively\n\nThe current raise is to 96, which is a 3x raise from the 32 BB. This is a standard raise size for them based on hand 86 where they also raised to 96.\n\nI have Kd 2c in the BB. This is a very weak hand - King with a terrible kicker. I'm out of position against a raiser who has shown they can have strong hands.\n\nMy stack is 250 chips (7.8 BB). The pot is 144 and I need to call 64. That means I'm getting pot odds of 144:64 or about 2.25:1.\n\nIf I call, I'd be putting in 64 chips, leaving me with 186 chips. The pot would be 208 going to the flop.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Hand strength: Very weak - K2o is one of the worst hands in poker\n2. Position: Bad - I'm out of position in BB\n3. Opponent: Has shown they can raise with strong hands and bet aggressively postflop\n4. Stack size: I'm short stacked at 7.8 BB\n5. Pot odds: 2.25:1 which isn't great for a hand this weak\n\nWith a short stack and a weak hand, I should either fold or shove all-in. Calling 64 chips and leaving myself with 186 chips would be awkward - I'd have less than 6 BB left and would be out of position.\n\nIf I shove all-in for 250:\n- The raise would be to 250 total (adding 154 more)\n- DeepSeek would need to call 154 to win 394 (the 144 pot + my 250)\n- That's about 2.56:1 odds for them\n\nHowever, K2o is just too weak. Even if they're raising wide, I'm dominated by so many hands (any Ace, any King with better kicker, any pair, etc.). The only hands I'm really ahead of are complete bluffs or very weak holdings.\n\nGiven my short stack, I should preserve my chips for a better spot. Folding is the correct play here. I can wait for a better hand or better position.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The pot is already 144 and I need to call 64. That's a lot of chips to give up. But K2o is truly terrible. Let me think about the math:\n\nIf I call 64, pot is 208, I have 186 left.\nIf I miss the flop (which is likely), I'm in a tough spot out of position.\nIf I hit a King, I have a terrible kicker and could lose a lot.\nIf I hit a 2, it's not likely to be good.\n\nThe best case is hitting two pair or trips, but that's very unlikely (about 2.5% chance of hitting two pair or better).\n\nI think folding is still correct. Preserve the 186 chips for a better spot. I need to be patient with my short stack.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at my situation:\n\n1. **Hand Strength**: 8s Td - This is a mediocre hand. It's offsuit and the cards are not connected. Not a strong starting hand.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position postflop, but we're preflop now.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 234 chips, which is only 7.3 BB. I'm in a critical tournament situation - very short stacked.\n\n4. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 is in the BB with 498 chips (healthy stack). From the recall data, I can see:\n   - They fold quite often preflop (hands 77, 79, 82, 83, 85, 87, 88 - 7 folds out of 13 preflop actions)\n   - When they do raise, they raise to 48 or 96 (which are 1.5x and 3x BB at 32/16 blind level)\n   - They called a raise in hand 86 and then bet aggressively on the flop (192 chips)\n   - In hand 81, they called preflop and then called down on flop and turn\n   \n   This suggests they're reasonably tight but capable of playing back when they enter pots.\n\n5. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 16 to win 48 (3:1 odds). That's 25% equity needed.\n\n6. **Tournament Considerations**: With 7.3 BB, I'm in shove/fold territory. I should be looking for spots to get my chips in with decent equity.\n\n8s Td is not a strong enough hand to call here. Even though I'm getting 3:1 odds, this hand plays poorly postflop and I don't want to commit chips with a marginal holding when I should be looking for spots to shove with fold equity or strong hands.\n\nI should fold here and preserve my chips for a better spot. There's no need to call 16 chips (which is 2.2% of my stack) with a weak hand that will be difficult to play postflop.",

Seems to play somewhat tight-aggressive.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): Very tight preflop, mostly folding. Only called a few times with small amounts.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: 4d 3c is one of the weakest starting hands in poker. It's offsuit, not connected (gap), and very low. This hand has almost no showdown value.\n\n2. **Stack size**: With only 7.3 BB, I'm in \"push/fold\" territory. I should be looking for spots to shove or fold, not call.\n\n3. **Position**: Being on the button is great, but with this hand it doesn't matter much.\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: I'm very short stacked. I need to preserve my chips for better spots or look for steal opportunities. However, 43o is not a hand to steal with.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 to win 48 (1.5:1). These aren't great odds for a hand this weak.\n\n**Decision**: Even though I'm short stacked and in position, 43o is simply too weak to play here. I should wait for a better hand or a better spot to shove. The opponents seem somewhat tight, but calling 32 chips (about 14% of my stack) with this garbage hand would be a mistake.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity.",

The pot odds don't justify calling with such a weak holding when I'm risking 16% of my stack.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current situation:**\n- I'm on BTN with J4 offsuit (4d Jh)\n- I have 202 chips (6.3 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds are 16/32\n- Pot is 96 chips (2 BB from blinds + 64 from SB's raise)\n- MiniMax-M2 in SB raised to 64 (2x the BB)\n- I need to call 32 to continue\n\n**My hand:** J4 offsuit is a very weak hand. In general, J4o should be folded in most situations.\n\n**Stack considerations:** With 6.3 BB, I'm in short stack territory. I need to be very selective about which hands I play. J4o is definitely not a hand worth risking chips with at this stack depth.\n\n**Opponent tendencies:** Looking at MiniMax-M2's recent actions:\n- Very tight player - folds most preflop (hands 83, 87, 88, 89, 90)\n- Only calls occasionally (hands 84, 86, 91)\n- The raise from SB is unusual for this player - they've been mostly folding or calling, not raising\n\nThis suggests MiniMax-M2 likely has a strong hand when they do raise. They've only shown aggression when they likely have premium holdings.\n\n**Pot odds:** I need to call 32 to win 96, which is 3:1 pot odds. While this might seem tempting, with J4o I'm unlikely to realize my equity, especially out of position (I'll be first to act postflop).\n\n**Tournament considerations:** With 6.3 BB, I need to preserve my stack for better spots. J4o is not a hand I want to invest 16% of my stack (32/202) with. I should wait for a better opportunity, preferably in position with a stronger hand, or look for spots to shove all-in as a steal.\n\n**Decision:** Fold. This is a clear fold with a weak hand against a tight opponent's raise.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand**: 8c 7c - Suited connectors, could be good for stealing or seeing flops cheaply\n**My Stack**: 186 chips (5.8 BB) - This is a short stack, in desperate need of a double-up\n**Position**: BTN - Best position at the table\n**Blinds**: 16/32\n**Pot**: 48 chips\n**To call**: 32 chips\n\n**Opponents**:\n- Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2): Has been active, raising preflop frequently (hands 86, 89, 91). Shown down with K9, pocket 9s, pocket 8s. Seems like a solid player who raises with decent hands.\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): Much more selective. Has folded many hands, only calling occasionally. Shown down with strong hands like AK, AJ. Seems tight.\n\n**Analysis**:\n1. With 5.8 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Calling 32 chips (17% of my stack) with 87s is not ideal.\n2. I have position on both opponents.\n3. The BB (Seat 4) is tight and likely to fold to pressure.\n4. The SB (Seat 3) is more active but could fold to an all-in.\n\n**Options**:\n- **Fold**: Preserves 154 chips (4.8 BB), but I'm bleeding out. Not great.\n- **Call**: Cost 32 chips, leaving 154 chips. With 87s I want to see flops cheaply, but this is 17% of my stack.\n- **Raise**: Minimum raise to 64 (33% of stack), or I could shove all-in for 186.\n\nGiven my short stack and position, and that both opponents could fold, a shove here makes sense. It's a classic squeeze play. 87s has decent equity when called, and I have fold equity.\n\nLet me calculate: If I shove 186:\n- SB needs to call 170 more (has 610 stack)\n- BB needs to call 154 more (has 104 stack)\n\nThe tight BB might fold many hands, and the active SB might also fold without a premium.\n\nThis is a good spot for an all-in steal.",

In hand 86 they raised preflop, called, then bet flop. In hand 91 they raised preflop and bet flop. They seem to be an active player who bets when they have initiative.\n- MiniMax-M2: Very tight - mostly folding, with occasional calls and one raise in hand 92. Only 72 chips left (2.25 BB), so they're extremely short.\n\nWith J2o in BB:\n- This is a trash hand that should almost always be folded\n- However, I get to see a free flop with 0 to call\n- Pot is 96 chips and I have 202 chips - that's a significant pot relative to my stack\n- I could check and see the flop for free, then evaluate\n\nTournament considerations:\n- I'm short-stacked at 6.3 BB\n- However, I have two opponents who are also short: MiniMax-M2 at 2.25 BB\n- The pot is already decent sized at 96 chips (3 BB)\n- If I hit any piece of the flop, I might be able to win a decent pot\n\nGiven that it's FREE to see the flop (0 to call), and the pot is already 96 chips (nearly half my stack), I should check and see the flop. Even with a terrible hand, getting a free look at a multi-way pot when I'm short-stacked is worth it. If I don't hit the flop, I can easily fold.

Seems somewhat active but not overly aggressive.\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3): Generally passive - folded in hands 92 and 94, called in hand 95 but folded to a flop bet.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With only 5.8 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. I cannot afford to call and then fold postflop - that would be chip suicide.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 80, which is 5:1 pot odds. Even with these odds, 5-2 offsuit is just too weak.\n\n8. **Decision**: This is a clear fold. With a trash hand like 5-2 offsuit, out of position, and a critically short stack, I cannot invest any chips here. I need to preserve my remaining stack for a better spot - ideally when I can be first to act (shove all-in) with a decent hand or in late position.\n\nThe fact that MiniMax-M2 called suggests they might have some kind of hand, but even if they have random cards, my 5-2 offsuit is at a huge disadvantage against any random hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity to shove with a hand that has some equity.",

They raised preflop in hand 91, folded a few times, called in hand 95 then folded on flop, checked in hand 96. Seems somewhat tight-aggressive.\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): 72 chips, also short-stacked. They've been calling and betting postflop. They raised in hand 92, called in hands 95 and 96, and bet on flop in both. Seems to defend their blind and play postflop.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand strength**: KTs is a decent hand, especially from the button. It has good potential for straights, flushes, and top pair with decent kicker.\n\n2. **Stack size**: I'm at 5.8 BB, which is critical. In tournament poker, when you're this short, you generally want to either shove (all-in) or fold preflop. Calling is rarely optimal because it commits too much of your stack without maximizing fold equity.\n\n3. **Position**: Being on the button is great - I act last postflop.\n\n4. **Opponent stacks**: \n   - MiniMax-M2 only has 72 chips (2.25 BB) in the BB. If I raise, they might be forced to call with a wide range or fold.\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 has a big stack (642 chips) and could apply pressure.\n\n5. **Tournament situation**: With 5.8 BB, I need to make a move soon. KTs is definitely in my shoving range from the button.\n\n**Decision**: With KTs on the button and only 5.8 BB, this is a clear shove (all-in) situation. I have fold equity against the BB who is also short, and my hand has good equity against their calling ranges. If I just call 32, I'd have 154 chips left (4.8 BB) which is still very short and I'd be out of position postflop.\n\nI should raise all-in for 186 chips total.",

Actually, looking at the players: Seat 1 is me, Seat 2 is out, Seat 3 is BB, Seat 4 folded, Seat 5 is out.

But my position is listed as BTN. This might be a heads-up situation or the button just passed. In any case, I'm in the SB position with 16 already invested.\n\n**Decision Analysis:**\n1. **Fold**: Give up 16 chips, preserve 218 chips (6.8 BB). With a tight BB, folding might be too nitty.\n2. **Call**: Invest 16 more to see flop with J7s. Not great with a short stack.\n3. **Raise**: \n   - Minimum raise to 64 (putting in 48 more chips)\n   - This would be a steal attempt against a tight player\n   - Risking 48 to win 48 (immediate 1:1 odds)\n   - If called, I have position and a hand with some potential\n\nGiven that:\n- I'm very short-stacked (7.3 BB)\n- The BB player is very tight (folds preflop a lot)\n- I have position\n- J7s has decent stealing potential\n\nThis is a good spot for a raise/fold steal attempt. However, I need to be careful not to risk too much of my stack with a marginal hand.\n\nIf I raise to 64 and get re-raised, I'd have to fold, losing 48 chips and dropping to ~5.8 BB.\nIf I raise to 64 and BB folds, I win 48 chips and increase my stack to 282 chips (8.8 BB).\n\nGiven the opponent's tightness, a raise seems profitable. However, with such a short stack, I could also consider just shoving all-in. Let me calculate:\n\nAll-in: 234 chips total\n- Already have 16 in, so 218 more\n- BB would need to call 202 more (234 - 32)\n- Pot would be 48 + 218 = 266\n- BB would be getting 266:202 or ~1.32:1 odds\n\nWith J7s, going all-in is probably too loose.

Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in SB (Seat 1) with 7c Jc\n- Stack: 234 chips (7.3 BB)\n- Already posted 16 as SB\n- Need to call 16 more to see flop (total 32)\n- BB is DeepSeek-V3.2 with 610 chips\n- Pot is 48 chips (16 SB + 32 BB)\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nDeepSeek-V3.2 appears to be very tight based on the hand history I can recall:\n- Folded preflop in hands 92, 94, 97, 98\n- Only called once in hand 95 and folded on flop\n- In hand 96, checked BB, checked flop, called a bet, then bet on turn\n\n**Decision Factors:**\n1. **Hand strength**: J7s is marginal but has some playability, especially in position\n2. **Stack size**: I'm short with 7.3 BB - need to be selective but also look for +EV spots\n3. **Opponent**: Very tight BB who folds to pressure\n4. **Position**: I have position postflop (acting last)\n5. **Pot odds**: Calling 16 to win 48 (3:1) - decent odds for a speculative hand\n\n**Options:**\n- **Fold**: Too weak with a tight BB and decent pot odds\n- **Call**: See flop for 16 more with position, but with short stack this commits me somewhat\n- **Raise**: Steal attempt. Minimum raise to 64 means putting in 48 more to win 48\n\nWith a very tight BB who folds a lot, a raise to 64 seems like a good steal attempt. However, with only 7.3 BB, I should be more aggressive and either fold or push. \n\nActually, let me reconsider: With 7.3 BB and J7s, I should either fold or go all-in. A min-raise to 64 would be weird with my stack size - if I'm going to raise, I should just shove.\n\nBut going all-in with J7s is too loose. Let me check the math:\n- If I fold: I keep 218 chips (6.8 BB)\n- If I call: I see flop for 16 more, have position, and can evaluate\n- If I raise to 64: I risk 48 to win 48 against a tight player\n\nThe call seems most reasonable. I have position, decent pot odds (3:1), and a hand that can flop some equity (pairs, flush draws, straight draws). If I miss the flop completely, I can fold and still have 6.8 BB.\n\nActually wait, I already have 16 invested. The pot is 48 and I need to call 16. That's 3:1 pot odds. With J7s and position against a tight player, calling is reasonable. I can steal on many flops or hit something decent.\n\nLet me go with call.",

I have:\n1. A strong draw (9 outs to flush)\n2. Position (on the button)\n3. A passive opponent who checked preflop\n4. Urgent need to accumulate chips\n\nI should bet here to:\n- Build the pot for when I hit\n- Take control of the hand\n- Potentially win the pot right now\n- Put pressure on my opponent\n\nGiven my stack size (218) and the pot (64), a good bet size would be around 1/2 to 2/3 pot, so about 32-48 chips. I'll go with a moderate bet of 48 chips (3/4 pot).\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The minimum raise is 32, which is exactly half the pot. That's a reasonable size. But given my short stack and the strength of my draw, I might want to bet more to build the pot and potentially set up a shove on the turn if I hit.\n\nActually, with 218 chips and a pot of 64, betting 48 (3/4 pot) seems good. This gives me good fold equity and builds the pot nicely.\n\nLet me go with a bet of 48 chips.",

Not a premium hand.\n\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - This is excellent position, the best at the table.\n\n**Stack:** 282 chips (8.8 BB) - I'm in short stack territory. This is critical. With less than 10 big blinds, I need to be looking for spots to either shove or fold. I don't have room to play speculative hands.\n\n**Blinds:** 16/32 - So the big blind is 32 chips.\n\n**Pot:** 48 chips (SB + BB)\n\n**Opponents:**\n- DeepSeek-V3.2 (SB): 594 chips (deep stacked)\n- MiniMax-M2 (BB): 24 chips (extremely short stacked, less than 1 BB)\n\n**Action:** I'm facing a 32 chip call.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\n\nDeepSeek-V3.2 (SB):\n- Hand 95: Called preflop, folded on flop\n- Hand 96: Checked preflop, checked flop, called flop bet, bet turn\n- Hand 97: Folded preflop\n- Hand 98: Folded preflop\n- Hand 99: Checked preflop, folded on flop\n\nSeems like a relatively tight player, defends SB sometimes but often folds. When they see flops, they can be active.\n\nMiniMax-M2 (BB):\n- Hand 93: Folded preflop\n- Hand 94: Folded preflop\n- Hand 95: Called preflop, bet flop\n- Hand 96: Called preflop, bet flop, folded turn\n- Hand 97: Folded preflop\n- Hand 98: Folded preflop\n- Hand 99: Folded preflop\n\nThis player is very tight, folding most hands preflop. But when they do play (hands 95, 96), they bet aggressively postflop.\n\n**Tournament Situation:** I'm down to 8.8 BB. This is critical. I need to preserve my stack or find good spots to double up. With K9o on the button, facing a 32 chip call:\n\n- The BB (MiniMax-M2) has only 24 chips total. They're essentially all-in already if they play.\n- The SB (DeepSeek-V3.2) has a big stack and could defend.\n\n**Pot Odds:** Calling 32 to win 48 = 1.5:1 or 40% equity needed. This is not relevant for tournament short-stack play though.\n\n**Decision:** With 8.8 BB, K9o is NOT a good enough hand to call or raise. It's dominated by many hands (any Ace, any King with better kicker, pairs). I should be shoving with much stronger hands (any Ace, any pair, broadway cards). K9o is too weak.\n\nThe fact that MiniMax-M2 in the BB has only 24 chips means if I raise, they might call with any two cards. If I just call, I'm letting DeepSeek-V3.2 in the SB see a cheap flop with their big stack, which is dangerous.\n\nBest play: FOLD. Preserve my 8.8 BB stack for a better spot. I should be looking for hands like any Ace, any pair, or at least KJ+ or QJ+ to make a stand.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"With only 8.8 BB, K9o is too weak to play from any position.

Given the pot odds and my desperation stack, I should either fold or shove. Calling 96 and leaving 122 behind would be terrible - I'd be pot-committed anyway.\n\nLet me consider shoving:\n- If I shove 218, I'm risking 218 to win 248 + 96 = 344\n- Getting 1.6:1 on my money\n- If opponent folds, I win 248 chips immediately (increase stack by 114%)\n- If called, I have decent equity with A8o\n\nGiven my desperation stack size and the decent pot odds, I think the best play is to shove all-in. This maximizes fold equity and gives me a chance to double up or win the pot outright.\n\nActually, wait - I need to check if \"raise\" is in my legal actions. It is: fold, call, raise. And the minimum raise is 256, but I only have 218, so I can go all-in for 218.",

When I \"raised 256\", that would have been my entire stack, but I only had 26 chips left after posting. Let me think about this...\n\nActually, looking at the action:\n- preflop: Seat 1 post_bb 64 (I posted 64, leaving me with 26)\n- preflop: Seat 3 raise 160\n- preflop: Seat 1 raise 256 (this must be all-in for my remaining 26)\n- preflop: Seat 3 call 96\n\nSo I went all-in preflop for my remaining 26 chips, and Seat 3 called. The \"raise 256\" is likely a display error or represents the total pot size or something. The key is I have 26 chips left and the action is on me on the flop.\n\n**Opponent Tendencies (DeepSeek-V3.2):**\nFrom the recall, I can see:\n- They check frequently on flop (hands 96, 99, 100)\n- They make small bets on turn (72, 32)\n- They've folded preflop a few times (hands 97, 98, 99)\n- They called preflop in hand 100 with a small amount\n\nGiven that I'm already all-in (or essentially all-in with 26 chips in a 536 pot), and it's 0 to call, I should check and see the showdown.\n\n**Decision:**\nI have top pair, weak kicker on a coordinated board. But I'm already committed with my tiny stack relative to the pot. I cannot fold since it's free to check. I should check and hope my hand holds up.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"check\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"I have top pair (Aces) with weak kicker on a coordinated board. With only 26 chips left in a 536 chip pot, I'm already pot-committed. Since it's free to check, I must see the showdown and hope my hand holds up against DeepSeek-V3.2's range.\"\n}",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm in BB with Ah8d (top pair, Ace kicker)\n- Board: 9h As Td 3s\n- Pot: 536 chips\n- My stack: 26 chips (very short!)\n- Only opponent left: DeepSeek-V3.2 (seat 3) with 386 chips\n- Action: It's checked to me on the turn\n- Legal actions: fold or check\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I have top pair (Aces) with a decent kicker (8)\n- The board is somewhat coordinated but not too scary: 9h As Td 3s\n- No flush draw yet (only 2 spades)\n- Possible straight draws: QJ would have an open-ended straight draw, KQ would have gutshot\n- I have a strong hand given the board texture\n\n**Opponent Analysis:**\nFrom the recalled actions, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been:\n- Checking and calling frequently\n- Making small bets on turn (72 and 32 chips in previous hands)\n- Folding preflop quite a bit\n- Seems fairly passive/trappy\n\n**Current Hand Context:**\n- Preflop: They raised to 160, I re-raised to 256, they called 96 more\n- Flop: I checked, they checked back\n- This suggests they might have something but not super strong, or they're trapping\n\n**My Situation:**\n- I only have 26 chips left (less than 0.5 BB!)\n- This is basically a \"push or fold\" situation\n- If I check, I'm giving a free card when I have a strong hand\n- I cannot bet because I don't have enough chips to meet the minimum raise (96 chips)\n\n**Tournament Consideration:**\n- With 26 chips, I'm critically short\n- Any hand I play should be all-in basically\n- Checking here is essentially giving up value with a strong hand\n- But I CANNOT bet because the minimum is 96 and I only have 26\n\nWait, let me re-read the legal actions: \"fold, check\"\n\nSo I cannot bet or raise - only check or fold. But checking with top pair and 26 chips seems weak. However, the rules say my legal actions are fold or check.\n\nActually, thinking about it more carefully: Since the amount to call is 0, I can check. But with 26 chips and top pair, I should want to get my money in. The issue is the minimum raise is 96, which I cannot meet.\n\nIn poker, if you have less than the minimum bet/raise amount, you can still go all-in. But it seems the system is restricting me to fold or check only.\n\nGiven I have a strong hand (top pair) and I'm extremely short-stacked, I should not fold. Checking seems like the only option, but I'm essentially playing for free when I should be trying to get value.\n\nLet me think if there's any scenario where checking is better:\n- If opponent is trapping with a monster (two pair, set, straight), then checking might save me\n- But with 26 chips left and 536 in the pot, I'm getting 20:1 immediate pot odds if I bet and get called\n\nActually, I realize I might be misunderstanding the rules. Let me reconsider: If the minimum raise is 96 and I only have 26, I should be able to go all-in for 26. But the system says my legal actions are fold or check.\n\nGiven the system constraints, I must choose between fold or check. With top pair Ace kicker on this board and being extremely short-stacked, folding would be terrible. Checking is the only viable option, even though I'd prefer to bet.\n\nLet me check my reasoning:\n1. Hand strength: Strong (top pair, Ace kicker)\n2. Position: BB (first to act on turn)\n3. Opponent: Passive, checked flop\n4. Stack: Critically short (26 chips)\n5. Legal actions: Fold or Check\n\nI cannot fold top pair with 26 chips left. Checking is the only option the system gives me.",

The board has:\n- Pair of 3s on the board\n- Ace on the board\n- T and 9\n\nPossible hands that beat me:\n1.

Let me analyze the current situation:\n\n**Current Hand (Hand #101 - RIVER):**\n- My position: BB (Seat 1)\n- My cards: Ah 8d\n- My stack: 26 chips (0.4 BB)\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 536 chips\n- Board: 9h As Td 3s 3d (pair of 3s on board, with an Ace)\n- Amount to call: 0\n- Legal actions: fold, check\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n1. **My hand strength**: I have Ah 8d. The board shows 9h As Td 3s 3d. This gives me two-pair: Aces and Threes (As Ah from my hand + 3s 3d from the board). However, note that the Ace is on the board, so anyone with an Ace has at least two-pair.\n\n2. **The action**: \n   - Preflop: Seat 3 raised to 160, I re-raised to 256 (all-in except 26 chips), Seat 3 called\n   - Flop: I checked, Seat 3 checked\n   - Turn: I checked, Seat 3 checked\n   - River: It's checked to me (amount to call is 0)\n\n3. **Opponent analysis**: The only remaining opponent is DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3) with 386 chips. They raised preflop and called my re-raise, then checked both flop and turn. This could mean:\n   - They have a strong hand and are slow-playing\n   - They have a marginal hand and are scared of the Ace\n   - They have a draw that missed\n\n4. **My situation**: I only have 26 chips left (0.4 BB) and the pot is 536 chips. I'm getting 536:0 odds to check (infinite pot odds).\n\n**Decision**: I cannot raise because my stack is too small (minimum raise is 96 chips, but I only have 26). My options are check or fold. With two-pair (Aces and Threes), even though it's not the nuts, I have significant showdown value. Checking costs me nothing and gives me a chance to win the 536-chip pot. Folding would be giving up on a hand with good equity for no reason.\n\nI should check and go to showdown.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at this hand, I'm on the BTN with 7c Js. I have 530 chips (8.3 BB) and blinds are 32/64. The pot is 96 and I need to call 32 more.\n\nMy hand is 7c Js - this is a marginal hand at best. It's not connected, not suited in a meaningful way, and the cards are low-medium.\n\nLet me analyze the situation:\n1. **Hand strength**: Very weak. J-7 offsuit is a folding hand in most situations.\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button which is good position, but that doesn't make up for the weak hand.\n3. **Stack size**: I have 8.3 BB which is short stack territory. This is a critical tournament situation.\n4. **Opponent**: DeepSeek-V3.2 is in the BB with 322 chips (about 5 BB). Looking at the opponent actions:\n   - They fold a lot preflop (hands 92, 94, 97, 98)\n   - They sometimes call/check (hands 95, 96, 99, 100)\n   - They occasionally raise (hand 101 - raised to 160)\n   - They seem to play somewhat passively post-flop with many checks\n\nGiven that I have a short stack (8.3 BB) and I'm facing a BB who also has a short stack (5 BB), and I have a terrible hand (J-7 offsuit), this is a clear fold. \n\nI cannot afford to call 32 chips (0.5 BB) with this hand. Even though I'm getting decent pot odds (calling 32 to win 96 - 3:1), the hand is just too weak and I need to preserve my chips for better spots, especially since I'm in short stack territory.\n\nWith 8.3 BB, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold. Calling with marginal hands is not optimal. I should wait for a better hand or a better situation (like when I'm in the BB/SB and can see a cheap flop).\n\nThe fact that DeepSeek-V3.2 has shown they can raise (hand 101) also suggests they might defend their BB, so I can't count on them folding to aggression.\n\n\nI'll conserve my tournament life by letting this hand go. The risk of losing more chips with such a weak holding outweighs any potential pot odds.",

I need to be very selective with my hands and look for spots to shove or fold.\n\n4. **Blinds**: 32/64 - The blinds are high relative to my stack.\n\n5. **Pot**: 96 chips - Already has the SB and BB posted.\n\n6. **Action**: I posted SB 32, DeepSeek-V3.2 posted BB 64.

With their short stack of 5 BB, they might be looking for a spot to get it in.\n\n**Decision analysis**:\n- With J5o and 8.3 BB, this is a clear fold in most tournament situations\n- I need to preserve my stack for better spots\n- Even though I'm on the button, J5o has very poor equity against any reasonable calling range\n- The opponent in BB is also short-stacked and might defend aggressively\n- The 32 chips I already posted as SB are sunk cost - I shouldn't throw good money after bad\n\n\n- The hand offers no compelling reasons to invest more chips, representing a classic low-equity situation that demands an immediate fold to protect my tournament life.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** K\u2660 4\u2660 - King-high with a suited connector, but very weak kicker\n**Position:** BTN (Button) - Best position\n**Stack:** 530 chips (8.3 BB) - Short stack, but not desperate yet\n**Blinds:** 32/64\n**Pot:** 96 chips\n**To Call:** 32 chips\n\n**Opponent:** DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB with 322 chips (5 BB)\n\nLooking at DeepSeek-V3.2's recent actions:\n- They've been folding a lot preflop (hands 97, 98, 103, 105)\n- When they do play, they tend to call rather than raise (hand 95, 100)\n- They made one big preflop raise in hand 101 (160 chips) which suggests they can be aggressive with strong hands\n- They check-fold on flops frequently when they do see them\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength:** K4s is marginal. It's suited but has a terrible kicker. From the button, this is a borderline hand.\n2. **Position:** Being on the button is excellent - I'll act last postflop.\n3. **Stack Size:** I'm short-stacked at 8.3 BB. I need to be selective but also looking for spots to accumulate chips.\n4. **Opponent:** DeepSeek-V3.2 is also short at 5 BB and has been folding a lot preflop. This suggests they're playing tight.\n5. **Pot Odds:** I need to call 32 to win 96 (3:1 odds). With my hand, this is not great, but the position helps.\n6. **Tournament Considerations:** I'm in a tournament with diminishing players. I need to preserve my stack but also can't wait forever.\n\n**Decision:** \n- Folding is too tight here. I'm on the button with a suited hand against a tight short-stacked opponent.\n- Calling is reasonable. I'm getting 3:1 odds, have position, and the opponent has shown they fold a lot.\n- Raising could be an option to try to take down the pot preflop, but with only 8.3 BB, I don't want to bloat the pot with a marginal hand.\n\nI think the best play is to **call**. The suited King has some playability, I'm in position, and the opponent has been tight. I can steal on many flops if they check to me. The 32 chip call represents only 6% of my stack, which is manageable.\n\nLet me reconsider - actually, with 8.3 BB, I should be more aggressive. A min-raise to 128 chips would be 24% of my stack, which is substantial. But it could fold out the BB who has been folding preflop a lot. However, if I get called, I'm in a tough spot with K4s.\n\nGiven the opponent's tightness (folding 4 of last 6 preflop opportunities), a raise could be profitable. But the risk is high with my marginal hand.\n\nI'll go with calling. It's the safer play that still allows me to use my position advantage without risking too much of my stack.",

Wait, let me check this again:\n   - DeepSeek has 64 chips total\n   - They posted BB of 64\n   - They raised 322, which is impossible since they only have 64 chips\n   - Actually, looking at the action: \"preflop: Seat 3 raise 322\" - this must mean they went all-in for their remaining 64 chips, and the system is showing 322 as the total amount to call including what's already in the pot.\n\n6. **To call**: 258 chips\n   - If I call 258, I'll have 240 chips left (498 - 258 = 240)\n   - That's 3.75 BB left, which is extremely short\n\n7. **Opponent analysis**: DeepSeek-V3.2 has been playing and has shown:\n   - They fold preflop frequently (hands 97, 98, 103, 105)\n   - When they do play, they've made some raises and calls\n   - They seem to be a fairly straightforward player\n   \nGiven the current situation, I need to carefully evaluate my options.

It's a marginal hand, especially from the button.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the BTN (Button), which is the best position post-flop.\n\n3. **Stack size**: I have 402 chips, which is 6.3 BB. This is a very short stack - I'm in the danger zone and need to make moves soon or I'll be blinded out.\n\n4. **Opponent**: Only DeepSeek-V3.2 in the BB with 450 chips (7 BB). Let me review their tendencies:\n   - They've been relatively tight, folding many preflop hands (hands 97, 98, 103, 105)\n   - They made a big raise in hand 106 (322 chips) and hand 107 (418 chips) - these look like all-in or near all-in moves\n   - In hand 101 they raised to 160 then called 96 more\n   - Their showdowns show they play a variety of hands: 88, J8s, Q4o, K9o, KJs\n\n5. **Pot odds**: I need to call 32 chips to win 96 chips - getting 3:1 odds. With my short stack, I should be looking for spots to shove or fold.\n\n6. **Tournament situation**: With 6.3 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. 6-5 offsuit is a marginal hand but on the button, it might be a spot to shove if the BB is tight.\n\nLooking at DeepSeek's pattern:\n- They fold to pressure often\n- They've made big raises in recent hands (106, 107) which suggests they might be playing aggressively\n- However, they also fold frequently preflop\n\nWith 6.3 BB, I should either:\n- Fold and wait for a better spot\n- Shove all-in to maximize fold equity\n\n6-5 offsuit is not a great hand, but:\n- I'm on the button\n- My stack is critically low\n- The BB has shown they can fold\n- I have fold equity\n \nI'm facing a critical tournament decision with a marginal hand. The 3:1 pot odds aren't compelling enough to justify a call with 6-5 offsuit. My short stack demands an aggressive approach, but this isn't the ideal spot. I'll fold and preserve my chips for a stronger hand that gives me better chances of doubling up. The risk of losing more chips outweighs the potential gain, especially with a hand that has limited post-flop playability.",

          "reasoning_content": "  The situation:\n- I'm in the BB (big blind) position\n- My cards: 3h 8h (offsuit, very weak hand)\n- My stack: 338 chips (5.3 BB)\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 128 chips\n- Players: Only Seat 3 (SB) and myself are active\n- SB posted 32, I posted 64\n- SB called 32 (so they put in 64 total, matching my BB)\n- Amount to call: 0 (I can check)\n- Legal actions: fold, check, raise\n\nThis is a heads-up situation against the SB. I have 3h 8h, which is a terrible hand. However, I'm getting a free check option since the SB just called.\n\nLet me think about this:\n1. Hand strength: 3h 8h is very weak, offsuit, low cards, no connectivity\n2. Position: I'm in BB, which is out of position postflop\n3. Stack size: I have 338 chips (5.3 BB), which is short-stacked\n4. Opponent: Only one opponent (SB) who just called\n5. Pot odds: If I check, I get to see the flop for free\n\nGiven my short stack, I should be very selective with my hands. 3h 8h is not a hand I want to invest chips with. Even though I can check for free, playing this hand out of position with a weak holding is not advisable.\n\nHowever, checking is free and I get to see the flop. The risk is minimal since I'm not putting more chips in. But with such a weak hand, even if I hit something (like a pair of 3s or 8s), I'm likely dominated.\n\nLet me consider raising: \n- Minimum raise is to 128\n- If I raise, I'm investing more chips with a terrible hand\n- This would be a pure bluff\n- With my short stack, bluffing with 5.3 BB left is risky\n- The SB called preflop, so they likely have something\n\nThe best play here is to check and see the flop for free, then fold if I don't hit something very strong. \n\nActually, let me reconsider. With 3h 8h, even if I flop a pair, it's likely to be a weak pair. \n\nI'm extremely short-stacked at 5.3 big blinds. In this critical tournament situation, my options are severely limited. The hand's complete lack of potential makes any further investment unwise. Checking allows me to preserve my dwindling chips while taking a minimal risk. If the flop doesn't deliver an exceptional hand, immediate folding becomes the smartest strategic move to maintain any chance of tournament survival.",

I'm very short stacked with only 5.3 BB\n2. The board is Jd 2d Tc - there's a possible straight draw (Q-K for broadway), a flush draw (diamonds), and I have absolutely nothing (3-high)\n3. My opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 is in the SB and just called preflop\n4. From the memory recall, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been quite aggressive preflop (raising in hands 101, 106, 107) but also folds frequently\n\n**Tournament situation**: With 5.3 BB, I'm in critical territory. I need to preserve my stack or find good spots to get it in. This is NOT a good spot.\n\n**Hand analysis**: I have 3-high with no draw. The board has two diamonds (flush draw) and connected cards that could make straights. My opponent could easily have:\n- Any Jack (top pair)\n- Any Ten (second pair)\n- Any diamond draw\n- Straight draws\n- Or just two overs\n\n**Decision**: I should check and see the turn for free. I have no hand, no draw, and I'm out of position. Raising would be pure bluff with a short stack, which is not advisable. If I raise and get called, I'm committed with a terrible hand. If I check, I can:\n1. See a free card\n2. Potentially hit an 8 or 3 (though that's still likely not good)\n3. Fold to any aggression on the turn\n\nThis is a clear check situation.

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**My Hand:** 3h 8h - This is a very weak hand, no pair, no draw. I have a backdoor flush draw but that's very weak.\n\n**Board:** Jd 2d Tc - There are two diamonds on the board, so a flush draw is possible. The board also has connected cards (J-T) so straight draws are possible.\n\n**Situation:** \n- I'm in BB with 338 chips (5.3 BB)\n- Pot is 192 chips\n- Opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 64 on the flop\n- I need to call 64 to see the turn\n\n**Pot odds:** 192 (pot) + 64 (bet) = 256 to win, need to call 64. So 256:64 or 4:1 odds.\n\n**My hand equity:** With 3-8 offsuit (hearts), I have essentially nothing. I might have a backdoor flush draw (need two more hearts), but that's very unlikely. I have no straight draw, no pair. I'm basically drawing dead.\n\n**Opponent analysis:** Looking at the opponent actions, DeepSeek-V3.2 has been playing somewhat aggressively. They made a big raise in hand 106 (322 chips) and hand 107 (418 chips - all-in). In hand 101 they raised to 160 preflop. They seem capable of making big bets.\n\nGiven my extremely weak hand (3-8 offsuit with no draw), the fact that I'm short-stacked (5.3 BB), and the opponent's bet, I should fold. I need to preserve my chips for better spots. Even with 4:1 pot odds, my hand is just too weak to continue. I have less than 10% chance of winning this hand, and I shouldn't waste 64 chips (about 12% of my stack) on such a weak draw.\n\nThe opponent's bet of 64 into a 192 pot is a 1/3 pot bet, which could be a value bet with a pair or better, or could be a continuation bet. Either way, my hand can't stand up to any pressure.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better spot.",

          "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this situation:\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- I'm on the Button (BTN) with A\u2660Q\u2665\n- My stack: 306 chips (4.8 BB) - very short!\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 96 chips\n- I need to call 32 to see the flop\n- I can raise to minimum 128\n- Only opponent: DeepSeek-V3.2 in BB with 546 chips\n\n**Key Analysis:**\n1. **Hand Strength**: A\u2660Q\u2665 is a very strong hand, especially in this situation. It's a premium hand.\n\n2. **Stack Size**: I'm extremely short-stacked at 4.8 BB. This is critical - I need to make a move soon or I'll be blinded out.\n\n3. **Opponent Analysis**: Looking at DeepSeek-V3.2's recent actions:\n   - They folded preflop in hands 97, 98, 103, 105\n   - They called preflop in hand 100, 109\n   - They made large raises in hands 101 (160), 106 (322), 107 (418)\n   - They bet postflop in hands 96, 100, 109\n   \n   This suggests they play somewhat aggressively, especially with larger raises when they enter pots.\n\n4. **Position**: I'm on the Button, which is the best position post-flop.\n\n5. **Tournament Situation**: With only 4.8 BB, I need to either shove or fold. Calling and leaving myself with ~4 BB is not optimal.\n\n6. **Decision**: With A\u2660Q\u2665 on the Button facing one opponent, this is a clear shove situation. My hand is strong enough to go all-in, and my stack size demands action.\n \nShoving directly aligns with optimal short-stack tournament strategy. The hand's strength combined with my dire chip situation makes an all-in move the most mathematically sound approach. This play maximizes fold equity and gives me the best chance to either win the pot immediately or get called by a potentially weaker hand.",

But at 5.3 BB, I'm in desperate need of a double-up.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully:\n- If I fold, I have 274 chips (4.3 BB) - still in push/fold territory\n- If I call, it's essentially for my tournament life\n- The opponent only has 32 chips, so they're the shortest stack at the table\n- A win would give me 14.3 BB, which is much more playable\n\nGiven that my opponent is extremely short (32 chips) and has shown aggression, I think they're shoving a wide range. Q8o is likely ahead of many random hands they could have. The pot odds are decent, and I desperately need chips.\n\nI think this is a call. I have to take a stand with my short stack, and the odds are reasonable against an opponent who could be shoving wide.\n\nActually, wait. Let me reconsider. The opponent raised TO 514, not BY 514. They posted 32 as SB, then raised to 514. That means they added 482 chips on top of their 32. But they only have 32 chips total? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me re-read: \"Seat 3 post_sb 32\" and \"Seat 3 raise 514\". If they only have 32 chips, they can't raise to 514.

If Seat 3 has 32 chips and posted SB of 32, they would be all-in automatically. The \"raise 514\" might be a system error or misrepresentation.

          "reasoning_content": "  Looking at the hand again:\n\n- I'm in BB with Q8 offsuit (8d Qc)\n- My stack: 338 chips (5.3 BB) - very short\n- Blinds: 32/64\n- Pot: 578 chips\n- Opponent (Seat 3, DeepSeek-V3.2) posted SB 32, then raised to 514\n- I need to call 450 chips\n- Legal actions: fold, call\n\nThe opponent has 32 chips total, so they must have gone all-in with their 32 chip SB post. The \"raise 514\" seems like it might be a display error or representing the total pot after my call.\n\nLet me think about this:\n- If opponent has 32 chips and posted SB, they're all-in for 32\n- The pot shows 578 total\n- I need to call 450\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. If opponent is all-in for 32, and I posted BB 64, the pot would be 96, not 578.\n\nLet me reconsider: Maybe the \"32 chips\" shown for Seat 3 is after posting the SB? Or maybe the chip counts are outdated?\n\nActually, I think the most logical interpretation is:\n- Opponent had 546 chips (32 + 514)\n- They posted SB of 32\n- Then they raised to 514 total (adding 482 more)\n- This would make them all-in\n- Pot would be: 32 (SB) + 64 (BB) + 514 (raise) = 610, but it shows 578\n\nHmm, still doesn't match perfectly. Let me go with the information given:\n- Pot is 578\n- I need to call 450\n- That means there's 128 in the pot already (578 - 450)\n- 128 would be 32 (SB) + 64 (BB) + 32 (some other amount)\n\nI think the most reasonable interpretation is that the opponent raised by 450 (to 514 total), and the pot calculation includes some existing money.\n \nI'm analyzing the tournament situation with an extremely short stack of 5.3 big blinds. With Q8 offsuit, I'm facing a crucial decision. The pot odds are 1.28 to 1, meaning I need around 44% equity to justify a call. My opponent's aggressive shove suggests a wide range, potentially giving me 45-50% equity with my current hand. \n\nThe tournament implications are significant. Folding leaves me with a precarious 4.3 big blinds, while calling puts my tournament life at risk. A successful call would double my stack to 14.3 big blinds, dramatically improving my competitive position. Given the aggressive opponent and reasonable pot odds, this appears to be a favorable spot to take a calculated risk and potentially double my stack.\n\nThe decision ultimately comes down to leveraging my short-stack advantage against an opponent likely making a desperate move. The potential reward of doubling my chips outweighs the risk of elimination in this scenario.",

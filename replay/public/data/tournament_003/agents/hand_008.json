Seat 5 (BB) has shown aggressive preflop raising tendencies (raised in hands 1 and 7)\n2. Seat 4 (SB) hasn't shown much aggression preflop from what I can see\n3. I have position advantage on both players\n\n**Hand analysis:**\n- J7o is a weak hand, not typically a raising hand from any position\n- However, being on the button with folds to me creates a steal opportunity\n- The blinds are small (1/2) relative to stack sizes\n- If I raise, SB and BB will need to defend with wider ranges\n\n**Tournament considerations:**\n- I have 92.5 BB, which is healthy but not massive\n- Need to accumulate chips but also preserve stack\n- Button steals can be profitable long-term\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold:** Conservative play with weak hand\n2. **Call:** Not good - putting in 2 chips with J7o out of position post-flop\n3. **Raise:** Steal attempt with position advantage\n\nGiven that Seat 5 (BB) has shown aggression, if I raise small (to say 6 chips total), they might re-raise, putting me in a tough spot with J7o. But if I raise and they call, I have position and can potentially steal post-flop.\n\nActually, looking at my hand history, I've been folding a lot (5 folds out of 7 hands). I might be playing too tight. Button with folds to me is a good spot to widen my range and apply pressure.\n\nHowever, J7o is really weak - it's not even a suited connector. The best case is hitting a J or 7 on flop, but even then it's vulnerable. The reverse implied odds are bad - if I hit top pair with J, I could lose to better kickers.\n\nGiven the tournament context and my stack size, I think folding is the prudent choice. Better to wait for a better spot than to get involved with J7o, even on the button.\n\n**Decision:** Fold.",

I'm getting 3:1 immediate odds, and if I hit a straight, flush, or even just a pair, I can potentially win more chips from my opponent who has shown some aggressive tendencies.\n\nThe minimum raise to 4 chips would be too aggressive for this weak hand, so I'll call the 1 chip to see the flop.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Getting excellent 3:1 pot odds with position advantage.

Minimum raise to: 4 chips\n\nFrom the opponent history, I can see GPT-OSS-120B has been quite active preflop:\n- 2 raises (4 chips and 6 chips)\n- 5 folds\n\nThis suggests they're either playing tight or have been getting weak hands. They're showing some aggression when they do play.\n\nMy hand Th 5s is weak - it's a suited connector but low in value. The Ten is decent but the 5 is very low. This hand has some potential for straights and flushes but is generally weak.\n\nKey considerations:\n- I'm getting good pot odds to call (1 chip to win 3 chips already in pot)\n- I have position on the opponent\n- My hand is weak but has some potential\n- I could see a cheap flop and potentially improve\n\nGiven the pot odds (1 chip to call for a 3 chip pot = 3:1 odds), I should be calling here with this hand. The position advantage and the fact that I can see a cheap flop makes this profitable in the long run, even with a weak hand like Th 5s.\n\nIf I call, I'll invest 1 chip to potentially win the 3 chips already in the pot, plus whatever additional chips might go in postflop if I hit something or if the opponent bluffs.\n\nI think this is a clear call situation given the excellent pot odds and position.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop. Hand: T\u2660 3\u2663. Board: 9\u2666 8\u2666 Q\u2663. So we have gutshot straight draw (J would give straight), plus backdoor flush draw (two diamonds on board, we have none). Also we have a pair? No, we have T, not on board. So we have open-ended? Actually board Q-9-8, we have T, which is between 9 and Q? T is between 9 and J? Straight possibilities: 9-10-J-Q-K? We have T, need J and K for higher straight. Also 8-9-10-J-Q? We have T, need J. So we have gutshot to both? Actually we have a gutshot: need J for both combos. So one-card runner (J) gives straight. Also we have a backdoor flush possibility (need two diamonds). Not strong.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) is the only remaining player; they bet 2 into pot 6 (so pot before bet 6, they bet 2 making pot 8). So they are betting small. Could be continuation bet with overcards (QJ? maybe). Could be a weak hand, maybe a draw. We have 181 chips, stack large relative to pot. Minimum raise is 4 (total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide based on opponent tendencies: recall shows they have called preflop once (hand 3) and then checked flop, bet turn and river. Not much data. In hand 3, they called preflop 5 (maybe a decent hand) and then checked flop (maybe weak). In other hands they fold preflop. So they might be tight? Not enough.\n\nGiven we have a weak hand, likely best to fold. But could consider calling to see cheap flop turn? Pot odds: call 2 to win pot 8+2=10? Actually pot after bet is 8, call 2 makes pot 10, we get 2/10 = 20% equity needed. Our hand has maybe ~12% chance to hit straight on turn (1/47 ~2.1%? Actually turn unknown). Wait we have only one card to improve: J for straight, also backdoor flush: need diamond on turn and river (2 cards). Probability to hit straight on turn: about 2 outs? Actually J's 4 outs, but some may be diamonds? J\u2666 also gives flush draw? Not needed. So approx 4 outs out of remaining 47 = 8.5% to hit straight on turn. If miss, could still have backdoor flush: need diamond on turn (2 diamonds left? Actually board has 2 diamonds, we have none, remaining diamonds = 13-2=11. So 11 outs for diamond on turn, then another diamond on river (10 remaining). Probability of two diamonds: (11/47)*(10/46)=~5.1%. So total equity maybe ~8.5%+5% = 13.5% approximate. That's less than 20% needed, so call not profitable.\n\nRaise? Raising to 4 would be a small raise; but we have weak hand, not good.\n\nThus fold.\n\nProvide JSON.",

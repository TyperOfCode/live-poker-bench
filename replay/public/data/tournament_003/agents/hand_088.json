Both opponents have shown they can fold to pressure, and MiniMax (BB) would be at risk with their 5.75 BB stack. All-in shove applies maximum pressure and gives me two ways to win: they fold or I have decent equity if called.\"\n}",
            "reasoning_content": "  Let me analyze this hand:\n\n**My situation:**\n- Position: BTN (Button) - good position\n- Cards: 5h Ad (Ace with a weak kicker)\n- Stack: 234 chips (7.3 BB) - short stack\n- Blinds: 16/32\n- Pot: 48 chips\n- Amount to call: 32\n\n**Opponents:**\n- Seat 3 (SB): DeepSeek-V3.2 with 482 chips - has been fairly active, showing some raises and calls\n- Seat 4 (BB): MiniMax-M2 with 184 chips - has been somewhat tight but has raised in the past\n\n**Analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength**: A5 offsuit is a decent hand, especially with an Ace. But the 5 kicker is weak. This hand plays better as a steal or all-in hand when short-stacked.\n\n2. **Stack size**: At 7.3 BB, I'm in the danger zone. I need to be looking for spots to either double up or steal blinds. Calling here would leave me with ~200 chips (6.25 BB), which doesn't improve my situation much.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies**:\n   - DeepSeek in SB: Has shown both folds and aggression. They called 32 chips in hand 81, raised to 96 in hand 86. They seem to defend their blind sometimes but also fold a lot.\n   - MiniMax in BB: Generally tighter but has shown some aggression. They raised to 64 in hand 81, called in other spots. They have a medium stack at 184 chips (5.75 BB).\n\n4. **Tournament considerations**: With 7.3 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. Calling 32 chips would commit ~14% of my stack with a marginal hand and I'd be out of position postflop (though I'm on the button, I'd act last preflop but the action goes SB, BB, then me postflop).\n\n5. **Pot odds**: Calling 32 to win 48 = 1.5:1 odds, which isn't great for A5o.\n\n6. **Best play**: Given my short stack and position, this is a good spot to either:\n   - Fold and wait for a better spot (preserve chips)\n   - Go all-in (234 chips) as a steal attempt, putting pressure on both opponents\n\nLooking at the opponent history:\n- MiniMax (BB) has shown they can fold to pressure (folded multiple times)\n- DeepSeek (SB) also folds frequently\n\nWith A5o on the button, this is a decent hand to shove with. It has blocker value (Ace blocks AA, AK, AQ, AJ) and decent equity against calling ranges.\n\nIf I shove 234 chips:\n- MiniMax would need to call 202 more (they have 184, so they'd be all-in)\n- DeepSeek would need to call 218 more (they have 482)\n\nGiven their stacks and that they'd both be at risk (especially MiniMax), I think there's a good chance they fold.\n\n**Decision**: Shove all-in with A5o from the button with 7.3 BB. This is a standard short-stack play to steal blinds and either double up or take down the pot uncontested.\n\nThe raise_to should be 234 (my total stack).",

Let me check: Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 0 chips (out). But then it says \"preflop: Seat 1 raise 234\". If they have 0 chips and are out, they can't raise. Maybe there's a mistake? Seat 2: Kimi-K2 - 0 chips (folded). Seat 4: MiniMax-M2 - 184 chips (BB). Seat 5: GPT-OSS-120B - 0 chips (folded).\n\nSo there's only one opponent who could have raised: Seat 1. But they're listed as having 0 chips. Possibly they went all-in with their last 234? But they're marked as \"out\". This is confusing.\n\nLet me use tools to understand the situation better. First, I should recall opponent actions to see if Seat 1 is actually active.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation:\n\n1. **My hand**: 7s 2c - This is an absolutely terrible hand, one of the worst possible starting hands in poker. It's offsuit with low cards, no straight potential, no flush potential.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm in the small blind (SB). Seat 1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) raised to 234 chips. Looking at the opponent actions, Seat 1 has been folding a lot recently but made a raise of 186 in hand #87 and 40 in hand #77. This current raise of 234 is quite large.\n\n3. **Stack sizes**: \n   - My stack: 482 chips (15.1 BB)\n   - Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2): 184 chips - they're the big blind and will act after me\n   - Seat 1 (raiser): 0 chips? Wait, the table shows Seat 1 has 0 chips but \"out\" - this seems contradictory. Actually looking at the player list: \"Seat 1: Kimi-K2 Thinking - 0 chips (out)\". If they're out, how can they raise? This might be a display issue. The action shows \"Seat 1 raise 234\" preflop.\n\n4. **Pot odds**: Current pot is 282 chips (my SB 16 + BB 32 + raise 234). I need to call 218 to win 282. That's about 1.3:1 pot odds, meaning I need about 43% equity to call. With 72o, I have maybe 15-20% equity against a typical raising range.\n\n5. **Tournament considerations**: I have 15.1 BB, which is short but not critically short. However, calling off nearly half my stack (218 of 482) with 72o would be terrible. Even if I somehow win, I'm risking too much with a terrible hand.\n\n6. **Opponent tendencies**: From the data, Seat 1 has raised twice in recent hands (40 and 186). The current raise of 234 is quite large, suggesting a strong hand.\n\n7. **Alternative actions**: I could consider raising as a bluff, but with 72o and facing a large raise, this would be extremely risky. Minimum raise would be to 436, which would leave me with only 46 chips if called. That's basically committing my stack.\n\nThe correct decision is clearly to fold. 72o is unplayable in this spot, especially facing a large raise. I should preserve my stack for better opportunities.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"72o is one of the worst starting hands.

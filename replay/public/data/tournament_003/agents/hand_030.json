It's not a good starting hand in most situations.\n\n**Position**: BTN (Button) - Good position\n- Being on the button is the best position, but that doesn't make up for a weak hand.\n\n**Stack**: 206 chips (51.5 BB) - Healthy stack\n- I have plenty of chips relative to the blinds.\n\n**Current situation**:\n- Pot: 22 chips\n- MiniMax-M2 raised from 4 to 16 (a raise of 12)\n- Amount to call: 14 chips\n- Minimum raise to: 28 chips\n\n**Opponent analysis** (MiniMax-M2):\nLooking at the recall data:\n- Hand 25: Preflop fold\n- Hand 26: Preflop fold\n- Hand 27: Preflop call 10, flop bet 15, turn check, river bet 15\n- Hand 28: Preflop raise 20, then fold\n- Hand 29: Preflop call 4, flop bet 4\n\nMiniMax-M2 seems to be playing somewhat aggressively but not particularly tight or loose. They've raised preflop before (hand 28) and made continuation bets on the flop.\n\n**Pot odds**: \n- I need to call 14 to win 22 (pot) + 14 (my call) = 36 chips\n- That's 14/36 = 38.9% equity needed\n\n**Hand equity**: \n- 9d 5d is a very weak hand. Even suited, this is typically a fold in most situations.\n- Against a typical raising range, this hand has very poor equity.\n\n**Tournament considerations**:\n- I have a healthy stack (51.5 BB)\n- This is not a situation where I need to take unnecessary risks\n- Losing 14 chips won't hurt me much, but it's still -EV to call with such a weak hand\n\n**Decision**: Fold\n\nThis is a clear fold. 9-5 suited is just too weak to call a raise from the button, even with position. The pot odds don't justify it, and I don't want to encourage myself to play marginal hands just because I'm on the button. I should preserve my chips for better opportunities.",

I need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\nFrom my hand history, I've been folding a lot from UTG position (folded all 5 previous UTG hands). This shows I'm playing tight from early position.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2) has raised preflop several times (6, 6, 12, 14 chips)\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has made some big raises (16, 65, 20 chips)\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) has also shown aggressive tendencies\n\nPocket 3s is a small pocket pair. In UTG position, this is typically a fold in most tournament strategies. The main value of small pocket pairs is set mining - hitting a set on the flop (about 12% chance). However, from UTG, I face the risk of being raised by players behind me, which would make set mining unprofitable.\n\nWith 49.5 BB, I have a decent stack, but not deep enough for optimal set mining (usually want 20+ implied odds). Also, being in early position makes it difficult to realize equity.\n\nGiven the aggressive opponents behind me (Kimi-K2, MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B), there's a high probability someone will raise if I just call. If I get raised, I'll have to fold, wasting my 4 chips.\n\nThe alternative would be to raise myself, but with 33 from UTG, that's generally not recommended as it commits too many chips with a weak hand that doesn't play well postflop.\n\nConsidering tournament preservation: I have an average stack (198 vs others: 206, 209, 185, 196). No need to take unnecessary risks with a marginal hand from early position.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot. Fold is the standard play here."

I need to call 4 chips to see the flop.\n\nFrom my hand history, I've been folding a lot from UTG position (folded all 5 previous UTG hands). This shows I'm playing tight from early position.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies:\n- Kimi-K2 (seat 2) has raised preflop several times (6, 6, 12, 14 chips)\n- MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) has made some big raises (16, 65, 20 chips)\n- GPT-OSS-120B (seat 5) has also shown aggressive tendencies\n\nPocket 3s is a small pocket pair. In UTG position, this is typically a fold in most tournament strategies. The main value of small pocket pairs is set mining - hitting a set on the flop (about 12% chance). However, from UTG, I face the risk of being raised by players behind me, which would make set mining unprofitable.\n\nWith 49.5 BB, I have a decent stack, but not deep enough for optimal set mining (usually want 20+ implied odds). Also, being in early position makes it difficult to realize equity.\n\nGiven the aggressive opponents behind me (Kimi-K2, MiniMax-M2, GPT-OSS-120B), there's a high probability someone will raise if I just call. If I get raised, I'll have to fold, wasting my 4 chips.\n\nThe alternative would be to raise myself, but with 33 from UTG, that's generally not recommended as it commits too many chips with a weak hand that doesn't play well postflop.\n\nConsidering tournament preservation: I have an average stack (198 vs others: 206, 209, 185, 196). No need to take unnecessary risks with a marginal hand from early position.\n\nBetter to wait for a better spot. Fold is the standard play here.",

Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nMy analysis: Pocket 3s from UTG is generally a fold in tournament poker. Small pocket pairs need deep stacks for set mining (implied odds). At 49.5 BB, it's borderline but not terrible. However, being in early position with aggressive players behind makes this difficult. If I call and someone raises, I'll likely have to fold. If I raise, I'm committing chips with a weak hand that doesn't play well postflop.\n\nGiven the tournament context and my position, folding seems correct. I should preserve my stack for better spots.\n\nI need to output JSON. Action will be \"fold\". Raise_to will be null. Reasoning should be brief.\n\nLet me structure the JSON: {\"action\": \"fold\", \"raise_to\": null, \"reasoning\": \"Pocket 3s from UTG is a standard fold.

The raise is 16, pot currently 22 (SB+BB+raise). So effective stack deep enough.\n\nQ9 offsuit is a marginal hand. In BTN, can consider 3-bet if opponent is tight, but Q9 is not great for 3-bet. Better to call? However typical strategy: with 49 BB, you can call to see flop and try to outplay. But Q9 offsuit is weak, likely dominated by better queens, and can be dominated by 9x. In BTN, you could consider a 3-bet for value if opponent is loose and raises small, but Q9 is not a premium hand. Most players would fold or call.\n\nWe need opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2's raise amounts: 16, 65, 20. So sometimes raises small (16, 20) and sometimes larger (65). Not clear. Could be a standard raise. Probably not a very tight player.\n\nGiven hand Q9 offsuit, likely fold. But consider call to see flop? The raise is 16, you would be putting 12 more (since you already posted 4? Actually you haven't posted anything; you need to call 16). You have 196 stack, after call you have 180 left. Pot becomes 38. You are out of position preflop but will be in position postflop. Q9 suited? No. So not strong.\n\nThus fold is likely.\n\nWe must output JSON.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze the situation:\n\n**Hand Analysis:**\n- I'm in the SB with Ks Qs (suited King-Queen)\n- My stack: 186 chips (46.5 BB)\n- Blinds: 2/4\n- Pot is 18 chips (SB 2 + BB 4 + Kimi-K2's raise to 12)\n- Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) raised to 12 from what looks like UTG+1 or MP position\n- Amount to call: 10 (I've already posted SB of 2)\n- BB (Seat 4, MiniMax-M2) still to act behind me with 293 chips\n\n**Opponent Tendencies:**\nFrom the recall data, Kimi-K2 has raised once before (Hand #32) and otherwise folded or checked. This suggests they might be raising with premium hands. The 3x raise (12 into 6) is a standard opening size.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\nKQs is a strong hand, especially suited. It's in the top 5-10% of starting hands. However, I'm out of position (SB) against a raiser, and there's still the BB to act behind me.\n\n**Position Considerations:**\nBeing in the SB is the worst position postflop. If I call, I'll be out of position against the original raiser and potentially the BB if they call.\n\n**Pot Odds:**\nPot is 18, I need to call 10. That's pot odds of 1.8:1 (35.7%). KQs has good equity against a typical raising range. Against a tight range of TT+, AQ+, KQs, we have about 40% equity, which makes calling mathematically correct.\n\n**Stack Sizes:**\nI have 46.5 BB, which is a healthy stack. Kimi-K2 has 48.75 BB, BB has 73.25 BB.\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\nI've been folding a lot (29 folds in 36 hands, only 6 wins). My stack is average but not growing. I need to find spots to accumulate chips.\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Fold**: Safe, but KQs is too strong to fold for 10 chips (2.5 BB) when I've already invested 2.\n2. **Call (10)**: Reasonable, but puts me in a tough spot postflop out of position.\n3. **Raise**: Could 3-bet to isolate Kimi-K2 and potentially take the pot preflop. A raise to 28-32 would be standard (3x his raise plus the dead money).\n\n**Decision:**\nI think the best play is to 3-bet. KQs plays much better as a 3-bet than as a call from the SB. It puts pressure on Kimi-K2 and might get him to fold hands like AJ, AT, KQo, etc. If he calls, I can still play aggressively on favorable flops.\n\nI'll raise to 30 (total), which is 2.5x his raise plus the dead money. This is a strong but not excessive 3-bet.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 30,\n  \"reasoning\": \"KQs is strong enough to 3-bet from SB against a single raiser. 3-betting puts pressure on opponent, avoids playing out of position with a marginal call, and can win the pot preflop.

Your goal is to win chips and ultimately win the tournament.\n\nYou have access to memory tools to recall information about past hands and opponent behavior. Use these tools strategically to inform your decisions.\n\nWhen you decide on an action, respond with a JSON object in this exact format:\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\" | \"check\" | \"call\" | \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": <number if raising, otherwise null>,\n  \"reasoning\": \"<brief explanation of your decision>\"\n}\n\nImportant rules:\n- Use \"check\" when there's nothing to call (amount to call is 0)\n- Use \"call\" when facing a bet you want to match\n- If raising, \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount you're putting in (not the additional amount)\n- You can only raise if \"raise\" is in your legal_actions\n- If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in\n- Always provide reasoning for your decision\n\nThink step by step about:\n1. Your hand strength and potential\n2. Your position and stack size\n3. Opponent tendencies (use tools to recall)\n4. Pot odds and implied odds\n5. Tournament considerations (stack preservation vs. accumulation)"

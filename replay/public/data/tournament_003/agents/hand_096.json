Seems somewhat active but not overly aggressive.\n   - DeepSeek-V3.2 (Seat 3): Generally passive - folded in hands 92 and 94, called in hand 95 but folded to a flop bet.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations**: With only 5.8 BB, I'm in push/fold territory. I cannot afford to call and then fold postflop - that would be chip suicide.\n\n7. **Pot odds**: I need to call 16 to win 80, which is 5:1 pot odds. Even with these odds, 5-2 offsuit is just too weak.\n\n8. **Decision**: This is a clear fold. With a trash hand like 5-2 offsuit, out of position, and a critically short stack, I cannot invest any chips here. I need to preserve my remaining stack for a better spot - ideally when I can be first to act (shove all-in) with a decent hand or in late position.\n\nThe fact that MiniMax-M2 called suggests they might have some kind of hand, but even if they have random cards, my 5-2 offsuit is at a huge disadvantage against any random hand.\n\nI should fold and wait for a better opportunity to shove with a hand that has some equity.",

The opponent MiniMax-M2 has only 136 chips (4.25 BB) and just limped in from the small blind position (actually seat 4, which appears to be the cutoff since seat 1 posted SB and folded).\n\nFrom the opponent history, I see:\n- MiniMax-M2 has been fairly active, with a mix of folds, calls, and occasional raises\n- In recent hands: called 32 in hand 91, raised to 64 in hand 92, folded in 93-94, called 16 in hand 95 (when in SB), then bet 32 on flop\n- They seem to be playing somewhat loose given their short stack\n\nThe pot is 80 chips (16 SB + 32 BB + 32 call from MiniMax-M2). I've already posted 32 as BB, so I can check to see a flop for free.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Hand strength: 9s7h is weak, but playable from BB against a limper\n2. Position: I'm out of position against MiniMax-M2\n3. Opponent stack: MiniMax-M2 has only 136 chips (4.25 BB) - very short stacked\n4. My stack: 546 chips (17.1 BB) - healthy but not huge\n5. Pot odds: I'm getting infinite odds to check (0 to call)\n\nGiven MiniMax-M2's short stack, they could easily go all-in on the flop with any decent hand. However, with 9s7h, I have some potential to hit a straight draw or pair up. Since it costs me nothing to check, I should see a flop.\n\nI could consider raising to try to take it down preflop, but:\n- MiniMax-M2 is short and may call with a wide range\n- My hand is weak and doesn't play well post-flop out of position\n- A raise commits more chips with a marginal hand\n\nBetter to check and see a flop. If I hit something, I can play. If not, I can fold cheaply.\n\nWait, let me check: Seat 1 folded, so it's just me and MiniMax-M2 heads-up. Actually, seat 1 posted SB and folded, so it's me (BB) vs MiniMax-M2 (who called from seat 4).\n\nGiven the opponent's short stack, they might be looking to shove on the flop with any piece. But checking is still the right play with this weak hand.\n\nDecision: Check.",

Opponent is very short and likely betting wide\n2. I have middle pair + gutshot = decent equity\n3. Pot odds are reasonable\n4. Folding leaves me with 546, calling and losing leaves 514 (not much difference)\n5. Calling and winning gets me to 618\n\nGiven the opponent's short stack and likely wide betting range, plus my reasonable equity and pot odds, I should call. Raising doesn't make sense with a marginal hand against a short stack who might be committed.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"call\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Middle pair with gutshot draw has enough equity against short stack's likely wide betting range.

That's important - I have a flush draw to the nut flush (A\u2660 on board is the Ace of spades).

I have middle pair, nut flush draw (A\u2660 on board, I have 9\u2660), and open-ended straight draw (need 6 or T). Pot is 144, opponent has 72 chips left. It's checked to me.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. Since amount to call is 0, \"check\" would be appropriate if I want to check back. But with my strong draw, I should bet for value. \"Raise\" means betting since no one has bet yet - actually in poker, when it's checked to you, you can bet (which would be a \"raise\" in this interface since the minimum raise is 32).\n\nI should bet to put pressure on opponent and get value from my draw. Opponent only has 72 chips left, so a bet of 72 would put them all-in. That's a reasonable bet size - half pot.\n\nActually, looking at the interface: \"Minimum raise to: 32\" - that means if I want to bet/raise, the minimum is 32. I could bet anywhere from 32 to all-in (514).\n\nI think betting 72 (putting opponent all-in) makes sense. Or I could bet smaller like 48. But with the nut flush draw and straight draw, I want to build the pot.\n\nActually, wait: opponent only has 72 chips. If I bet 72 and they call, they're all-in. That's fine. If they fold, I win the pot. Either outcome is good.\n\nSo I'll bet 72.\n\nBut I need to make sure: \"raise_to\" is the TOTAL amount I'm putting in. Currently I have 0 in the pot on this street. So if I want to bet 72, I would put \"raise_to\": 72.\n\nActually, let me think: on the turn, I haven't put any chips in yet. So to bet 72, I would be putting in 72 total. That seems right.\n\nMy reasoning: I have strong drawing equity with nut flush draw, open-ended straight draw, and middle pair. Betting puts pressure on short-stacked opponent and builds pot for when I hit my draw.\n\nJSON response should be: {\n  \"action\": \"raise\",\n  \"raise_to\": 72,\n  \"reasoning\": \"Strong drawing hand with nut flush draw, open-ended straight draw, and middle pair.

Half-pot bet builds pot for when I hit my draws.\"\n}\n\nActually, let me double-check: The board shows A\u2660, I have 9\u2660. That's indeed the nut flush draw since Ace is the highest spade. Yes.\n\nAlso, my straight draw: I have 9-7, board has 7-8, so I need 6 or T. That's 8 outs, but some are spades (6\u2660, T\u2660) which would give me flush too.

            "reasoning_content": "I need to analyze this hand carefully. Let me break down the situation:\n\n1. **Hand Details:**\n   - Position: BTN (Seat 4)\n   - Cards: Ad Jc\n   - Stack: 104 chips (3.2 BB)\n   - Blinds: 16/32\n   - Pot: 216 chips\n   - Board: 7d 8s As Kd\n\n2. **Current Situation:**\n   - It's the TURN\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has bet 72 chips\n   - I need to call 72 chips to continue\n   - My stack is exactly 104 chips\n   - Minimum raise would be to 144 chips, but I only have 104\n\n3. **Hand Analysis:**\n   - I have Ad Jc - Ace of diamonds, Jack of clubs\n   - The board is 7d 8s As Kd\n   - I have top pair with Ace on the board\n   - But there's also a possible straight draw (9-10 would make a straight)\n   - The board has two diamonds, so there could be flush draws\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis:**\n   - Seat 3 (DeepSeek-V3.2) has been in the hand since preflop\n   - They called my 32-chip bet on the flop\n   - Now they're betting 72 on the turn\n   - They have 442 chips, so this is a significant bet relative to the pot\n\n5. **Stack Considerations:**\n   - I have 104 chips total\n   - If I call 72, I'll have 32 chips left\n   - This would put me in a difficult spot for the river\n   - If I fold, I'm essentially out of the tournament (32 chips = 1 BB)\n\n6. **Decision Factors:**\n   - I have top pair with Ace kicker\n   - The bet size (72) is about 1/3 of the pot (216)\n   - This could be a value bet or a bluff\n   - With only 32 chips left after calling, I'd be almost committed\n   - My opponent has shown aggression by betting both flop and turn\n   \nI'm facing a critical tournament moment. With just 104 chips and a marginal hand, the risk of elimination is extremely high. Calling would leave me with a minimal stack, essentially making me a short stack. Folding means accepting defeat with only 32 chips remaining. The aggressive bet from a strong opponent suggests they likely have a solid hand. Given the tournament pressure and weak position, folding appears to be the most prudent choice to conserve any remaining chips.",

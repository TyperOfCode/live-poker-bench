They've also folded to some raises. They seem to be playing a balanced but somewhat aggressive style.\n\nMy hand (2c 9d) is terrible - one of the worst possible starting hands. However, I'm on the button and only need to call 32 chips into a pot of 96, giving me 3:1 pot odds. With 6 BB stack, I'm in push-or-fold territory.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Hand strength: Terrible - 92o is garbage\n2. Stack size: 6 BB is critical - I need to find a spot soon\n3. Position: Button is great, but hand is so bad\n4. Pot odds: 32 to win 96 (3:1) - good immediate odds\n5. Opponent: Might check a lot of flops if they have weak hands\n6. Tournament: Need to preserve chips but also accumulate\n\nWith 6 BB, standard play is to shove with a wide range from the button, but 92o is at the very bottom of any reasonable shoving range. However, calling 0.5 BB to see a flop in position with a short stack could be okay if I plan to fold most flops.\n\nActually, with 6 BB, I should be looking to shove preflop with decent hands, not call. Calling commits 8% of my stack with a terrible hand. The BB has me covered and could put pressure postflop.\n\nBetter to fold and wait for a better spot. I'm not in the blinds next hand, so I have time. With 6 BB, I need a hand with some equity.\n\nLet me check if there are any other players behind - only the BB is left to act. Actually, all other seats are folded or have 0 chips. So it's just me vs BB.\n\nGiven the terrible hand and that I'm not in immediate danger of blinding out (I just posted SB, next hand I won't have to post), I should fold and wait for a better spot.\n\n{\n  \"action\": \"fold\",\n  \"raise_to\": null,\n  \"reasoning\": \"92o is one of the worst possible hands.

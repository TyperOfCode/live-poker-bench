            "reasoning_content": "  The search didn't return specific results, so I need to make a decision based on the current situation.\n\nLet me analyze this hand:\n\n1. **Hand strength**: Q2s (Q\u26652\u2660) is a very weak hand. The queen is decent but the kicker is terrible (2). It's offsuit, so no flush potential. This is typically a fold.\n\n2. **Position**: I'm on the Button (BTN), which is good position. However, this doesn't compensate for the hand weakness.\n\n3. **Action**: There's already been a raise to 16 (Seat 4) and a 3-bet to 28 (Seat 5). I need to call 28 chips to see the flop.\n\n4. **Stack size**: I have 218 chips (54.5 BB). Calling 28 chips would be about 13% of my stack. If I call and miss, I'm giving up significant chips.\n\n5. **Pot odds**: The pot is currently 50 chips (blinds + raises). I need to call 28, so pot odds are 50:28 or about 1.79:1. This is not great odds for a speculative hand.\n\n6. **Opponent ranges**: Seat 4's initial raise and Seat 5's 3-bet suggest strong ranges. Seat 5 is showing significant strength with the 3-bet.\n\n7. **Tournament considerations**: With 54.5 BB, I have a healthy stack. I don't need to take marginal spots. Preserving my stack for better opportunities is more valuable than trying to hit a miracle flop with Q2o.\n\nEven though I'm on the Button, Q2o is simply too weak to call a 3-bet. The hand has very poor equity against the likely strong ranges of my opponents. I should fold and wait for a better spot.",

Stack: 202 chips (50.5 BB)\n\n**Action so far:**\n- Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised to 16 (4x BB)\n- Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B) 3-bet to 28 (7x BB)\n- Seats 1 and 2 folded\n- I need to call 24 chips\n\n**Pot size:** Currently 50 chips (blinds 2+4 + raise 16 + 3-bet 28)\n\n**My analysis:**\n\n1. **Hand strength:** 8\u26669\u2660 is a marginal hand, especially off-suit. It's not a premium hand by any means. It has some potential for straights but plays poorly in 3-bet pots.\n\n2. **Position:** I'm on the BTN, which is good, but I'm facing a raise and a 3-bet. Seat 4 still has to act after me, so I could face a 4-bet.\n\n3. **Opponent tendencies:**\n   - **Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2):** Has mostly folded preflop (7/10 times), called twice from BB/SB. Seems tight. Raised to 16 this hand.\n   - **Seat 5 (GPT-OSS-120B):** Has mostly folded/called, made one flop bet. 3-bet to 28 this hand. This is the first 3-bet I've seen.\n\n4. **Pot odds:** Need to call 24 to win 50 (current pot) + 24 (my call) = 74. Pot odds: 24/74 = 32.4%. My hand needs >32.4% equity against their ranges.\n\n5. **Implied odds:** With 8\u26669\u2660, I need to hit a strong hand (straight or two pair) to continue. The SPR (stack-to-pot ratio) after calling: Effective stack ~158 (Seat 5) vs pot ~74, SPR ~2.1. Low SPR means less implied odds.\n\n6. **Tournament considerations:** I have 50.5 BB, which is healthy. Calling 12% of my stack with a marginal hand in a 3-bet pot is risky.\n\n7. **Alternatives:** Raising seems bad with this hand. Folding seems correct.\n\nAgainst likely 3-betting ranges (QQ+, AK, maybe AQ, JJ), 8\u26669\u2660 has ~30% equity at best. The pot odds are close but not favorable given:\n- I'm out of position relative to the 3-bettor\n- Low SPR reduces implied odds\n- Risk of 4-bet from Seat 4\n- Marginal hand that plays poorly postflop\n\n**Decision:** Fold. The hand isn't strong enough, the situation is too aggressive, and I preserve my stack for better spots."

Call 12 chips - This gives me good pot odds, but I'm letting a tight player see the flop in position. They might have a stronger range than me.\n\n2. Fold - This would be folding a premium hand, which is generally not recommended unless I have specific reads that suggest I'm behind.\n\n3. Raise to 40 (minimum) - This is quite small and might invite calls from worse hands. With AK, I want to build a pot when I'm ahead.\n\n4. Raise larger - I could make a bigger 3-bet to around 65 chips to apply more pressure.\n\nLooking at the opponent's recent actions, GPT-OSS-120B seems tight and passive. Their 3-bet here suggests they have a premium hand or a strong drawing hand. However, I have AK which is still a very strong hand.\n\nIn tournament poker, especially when you've been folding too much (17/20 hands), you need to be more aggressive with premium hands to accumulate chips. AK is a hand that plays well both as a caller and as a 3-bettor.\n\nGiven that I'm on the button with position, and the opponent appears tight, I think the best play is to 3-bet. The minimum raise to 40 seems too small and might invite calls from worse hands like suited connectors or smaller pairs. \n\nI should make a larger 3-bet to around 65 chips to:\n1. Build a pot when I'm ahead\n2. Apply pressure to the opponent\n3. Get value from worse hands that might call\n4. Take control of the hand\n\nThis sizing also gives me room to continue betting on favorable flops while still having enough chips left for future streets if needed.\n",

No other raises, so we can call 16 (total 20) or raise to at least 28. QJ suited is a decent hand in CO, especially suited connectors. In a tournament with 46.5 BB, we have decent stack, can play aggressively. Need to consider opponent's tendencies; we have no data. MiniMax-M2 raised from MP? Actually seat 4 is MP? Seats: 1 UTG? Not sure but seat 4 is after BB? In 5-player table, positions: Seat1 UTG, Seat2 SB, Seat3 BB, Seat4 CO? Wait seat5 is us CO, so seat4 is MP? Actually with 5 players: Seat1 UTG, Seat2 SB, Seat3 BB, Seat4 UTG+? Actually order: after BB is UTG (seat1), then CO (seat5). But seat4 is before CO, so it's MP? Anyway raise size 16 is 4x big blind, standard. QJ suited is a good hand to 3-bet or call? With 46 BB, could 3-bet to isolate and build pot. But opponent unknown. Could also call to see flop. Considering raise to 28 would be 7 BB, maybe okay. But we need to consider stack depth: 46 BB, we can afford. 3-betting could gain fold equity. QJ suited can flop strong draws. I think a 3-bet is reasonable. However we lack info on opponent's 3-bet tendencies. Could be a tight player? If they raise, they likely have strong hand, so 3-bet could be risky. But QJ suited can still play well.\n\nGiven tournament, we want chip accumulation but also preserve. I think raising to 28 (total) is good to apply pressure. Let's do raise.\n\n",

After SB 2, BB 4, CO raise to 16 (adds 12 more), we raise to 28 (adds 12 more), then CO 3-bet to 65 (adds 37). So pot before his 3-bet is 99 + 16 + 28? Actually initial pot 99 includes blinds and maybe antes; after his raise to 16, pot is 99+12? Not sure. Anyway pot is around 99+ (16-4?) Let's just consider effective stack: 158 total, he raised to 65, we need to call 37 more. Our remaining after call would be 158- (we already put 28?) Actually we put 28 already, so remaining 130. So calling 37 would leave us with 93 behind. That's about 0.6 BB? Actually 93 chips left is about 23 BB. So calling would be okay but we are out of position after flop (since he is CO). QJ suited has potential but not great against likely strong range. The 3-bet size is 65, which is about 2.5x his raise (16) and about 2.6x BB. That's moderate. Could be a wide 3-bet range from CO. In tournament, with 39.5 BB stack, we can consider calling to see flop if we think we have good implied odds. QJ suited can make straights, flushes, top pair etc. But also can be dominated by AQ, KQ, AJ, etc.\n\nGiven we are out of position, and opponent's 3-bet may be strong, maybe we should fold. But we could also call to see flop and try to outplay. However we have decent stack and can afford to call. The pot after call would be around 99 + 16 + 28 + 65 + 37 = 245? Actually call adds 37, making total pot ~ 99+16+28+65+37 = 245. So pot odds: need to call 37 to win ~245, about 15% needed. QJ suited likely not ahead but can improve. However we are out of position.\n\nGiven typical tournament strategy, with 39.5 BB and a 3-bet, suited connectors are marginal. I think folding is prudent.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\n"

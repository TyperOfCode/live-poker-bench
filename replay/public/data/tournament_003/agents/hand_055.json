Many players would call with any pair or A-x. 9cJc is decent but not premium; a push could be risky but also may win blinds. At BTN, raising to 24 may be good to build pot and isolate. Opponents have 202 and 117 chips; they could call. We might want to raise to about 30-40 to get value if they call with worse hands.

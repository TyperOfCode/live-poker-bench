This raise to 8 seems unusual for them.\n- GPT-OSS-120B: Mixes between folding and raising to 8. They've raised to 8 in hands 35 and 38, and called here. In hand 38, they checked down and made a small river bet.\n\n**Hand Strength:**\n- 3d 4d is a low suited connector\n- Very weak hand that rarely makes strong holdings\n- Even when it hits, it's often dominated\n- From SB, this is a clear fold in most situations\n\n**Position:**\n- In SB, we're out of position for the entire hand\n- This makes it harder to realize equity\n\n**Pot Odds:**\n- Need to call 6 to win 22 (3.67:1)\n- This might seem reasonable, but with this hand from this position, it's not enough\n\n**Tournament Considerations:**\n- We have 41.5 BB, which is a healthy stack\n- No need to take marginal spots\n- Better to preserve chips for better opportunities\n\n**Decision:**\nThis is a clear fold. 34s from SB facing a raise and a call is not a profitable play. We're out of position with a weak hand that rarely makes the nuts. Even though the price seems okay, the combination of hand strength, position, and tournament considerations makes this an easy fold.\n\nThe raise from MiniMax-M2 is suspicious given their tight history, but that doesn't make 34s good enough to call. If anything, it suggests they might have a real hand.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation. I'm in UTG position with Qh 3c. This is a very weak hand - Queen-three offsuit. UTG is the worst position to play from, and this hand has very little potential. Looking at my hand history, I've been folding most hands, which is appropriate for my position and chip stack.\n\nMy stack is 196 chips (49 BB), which is healthy. The blinds are 2/4. I need to call 4 chips to see the flop. However, with this weak hand in UTG, I'll have to act first on every street, making it difficult to play post-flop.\n\nLooking at opponent tendencies from the search results: I see Kimi-K2 has raised preflop several times (hands 32, 36, 37). GPT-OSS-120B has also raised preflop (hands 30, 35). So there are aggressive players at the table.\n\nWith Q3o in UTG, this is an easy fold. The hand has minimal preflop value, poor post-flop playability, and I'm out of position against the entire table. Even if I hit a Queen, I'll be vulnerable to better kickers. The 3 is essentially a dead card.\n\nTournament considerations: I have 49 BB, which is a healthy stack. No need to gamble with marginal hands, especially from early position. Better to preserve chips for better spots.\n\nPot odds: Would need to call 4 into pot of 6 (2+4), so getting 1.5:1 odds. But implied odds are poor with this hand since it's unlikely to make a strong hand that can win a big pot.\n\nDecision: Fold. This is standard poker strategy - fold weak hands from early position.",

This makes it a more difficult spot to play marginal hands.\n\n3. **Stack Size**: I have 130 chips (32.5 BBs), which is a medium stack. Not short stacked but not deep either.\n\n4. **Opponent Analysis**: Looking at the recall data:\n   - Kimi-K2 (Seat 2) has been raising frequently (12-32 chips)\n   - GPT-OSS-120B (Seat 5) has also been raising (8-12 chips)\n   - These players seem aggressive preflop\n\n5. **My Recent History**: Looking at my last 10 hands, I see:\n   - I'm 8-28 in terms of wins vs folds (20.5% win rate)\n   - I've been folding a lot in early positions\n   - In hand 31, I had Jc5d in UTG and folded\n   - In hand 36, I had Ac9s in UTG and folded\n\n6. **Pot Odds**: I need to call 4 chips to stay in, with a pot of 6 chips. That's getting 1.5:1 pot odds.\n\n7. **Considerations**:\n   - KJs is too strong to fold outright in most situations\n   - UTG position is challenging with marginal hands\n   - There are aggressive players behind me who might re-raise\n   - I have decent stack size to play postflop\n\nGiven that KJs is a reasonably strong hand with good playability, and considering that I've been folding too much lately (28 folds in last 39 hands), I think this is a spot where I should be more aggressive. \n\nThe minimum raise of 8 chips offers a strategic way to potentially win the pot immediately or gain positional advantage. While the risk of being re-raised exists, the hand's strength and potential for postflop play make it worth the aggressive approach.",

            "reasoning_content": "Let me analyze this situation more carefully:\n\n1. My hand: Ks Jc on board Qs 5d 8c 6s Ah\n   - This gives me King high with Jack kicker\n   - No flushes (only spade is on board, but I have Ks not spade)\n   - No straights\n   - This is likely a weak hand\n\n2. Opponent analysis:\n   - GPT-OSS-120B has been relatively passive\n   - They showed Js Kd on a similar King high board (hand #24)\n   - They tend to check rivers frequently\n   - They bet on river in hand #38 for 4 chips\n\n3. Board analysis:\n   - Qs 5d 8c 6s Ah - this is a disconnected board\n   - The Ace on river doesn't help me (I have K-J)\n   - There are no obvious draws that completed\n\n4. My options:\n   - Check: See if they bet, then decide\n   - Raise to 11: Make a small bluff/bet\n\n5. Pot odds and stack considerations:\n   - Pot is 44 chips\n   - I can raise to 11 (minimum raise)\n   - If called, I'd have 22 chips left (5.5 BB)\n   - This is getting short-stacked\n\n6. Tournament considerations:\n   - I'm at 27.8 BB, getting short\n   - Need to be more aggressive to accumulate chips\n   - A small 11-chip bet has good risk/reward\n\nLooking at my BB history, I see I have a 20.5% win rate from BB, which is quite low. I need to be more selective about when I bet from the BB.\n\nGiven that:\n- My hand is likely beaten\n- But opponent has shown weak hands before\n- I need chips to stay competitive\n- Small bet has good pot odds\n\nI think checking is the better play here. If they bet, I can fold. If they check, I might try a small bet, but checking first gives me more information.\n",

            "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop: we have Kc 9s, board Qs 5d 8c. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) in seat 4 bet 11 into pot 33. Our stack 264, we have 66 BB. We are BTN, we called preflop. So flop: we have Kc 9s, board: Qs 5d 8c. Hand combos: we have gutshot straight draw? Let's see: cards: 9,8,? Actually we have 9 and board 8, so we have open-ended straight draw? Need 7 or J for straight: 7-8-9-10-J? Wait we have 9, board 8, Q,5. So possible straight draws: 7-8-9-10-J requires 7 and J; 9-10-J-Q-K needs 10 and J; we have K, so need J and 10 for straight K-Q-J-10-9? Actually K-Q-J-10-9 is a straight, we have K, need J and 10. Also we have gutshot to a straight with 7? 7-8-9-10-J? Not with K. So we have two overcards (K) and a gutshot? Actually we have a gutshot to a straight: need J for 9-10-J-Q-K? No need 10 and J. So not a gutshot; we need both 10 and J. So currently we have only one pair? No pair. So we have overcards: K is top pair potential, 9 is middle.\n\nBoard: Qs 5d 8c. Opponent bet 11 (about 1/3 pot). Pot 33, bet 11, we call 11 to see turn, pot would be 55 after call.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has shown some patterns: In hand 32, they bet 20 on flop after raising preflop? Actually hand 32: preflop call 8, flop bet 20 (bigger). Hand 33: flop check, turn bet 4. Hand 34: flop call 8, turn bet 8. Hand 38: flop check, turn check, river check. So they sometimes bet small on flop, sometimes check. They seem to be a relatively passive player, maybe medium strength.\n\nIn this hand, they raised preflop to 8 (small raise) from UTG? Actually seat 4 is probably UTG? Not sure. They raised 8 (2x big blind) which is a limp raise? Could be wide range.\n\nNow flop bet 11 (about 1/3 pot). This could be continuation bet with a wide range, maybe they have Q, 8, 5, or combos. Could also be a bluff with missed overcards.\n\nOur hand Kc 9s has some equity: we have two overcards, a gutshot? Not exactly. We have a backdoor flush draw? We have spade Kc? Actually Kc is clubs, not spade. Board has Qs, so we have no spade. So no flush draw.\n\nOur equity vs opponent's range: If opponent has Qx (like QJ, QT, Q9 etc.) they'd have top pair, we have K kicker maybe second best. If they have 8x they'd have middle pair, we have K kicker. If they have 5x they'd have bottom pair. If they have combos like J10 (draw) we have some equity.\n\nGiven small bet, we could call to see turn, as we have decent equity and stack deep.\n\nWe need to consider tournament: we have 66 BB, comfortable.\n\nThus call seems appropriate.\n\nCheck if raising is possible: minimum raise to 22 (i.e., raise additional 11). Raising would be to 22 total. That would be a 2x raise. Could be a semi-bluff? Not much.\n\nBetter to call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 11 would be a bet of 11 (since min raise = 11). So raise to 11 (i.e., bet 11). Could also raise more.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: opponent stack unknown? Not given but earlier they had 111 chips preflop. They have not bet much, so likely still near 111. Our stack 253. So we have big stack relative.\n\nOpponent tendencies from recall: Past actions show they sometimes bet small on turn (4,8). They also check sometimes. Not clear. They seem to be a passive player who checks often, but also bets small when they have something.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely we should check and fold to river bet. Since we have only a gutshot and no pair, it's not worth betting. Also we have position (BTN) but opponent is in SB? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, they were SB? Preflop: seat1 post_sb 2, seat2 post_bb 4, seat3 fold, seat4 raise 8 (so seat4 is UTG? Actually seat numbers: seat1 is SB, seat2 BB, seat3 maybe UTG, seat4 is maybe cutoff? Wait table: seat1 SB, seat2 BB, seat3 maybe UTG, seat4 maybe MP? But not important. They are the only other player left, they are acting first (they checked). So we are last to act.\n\nGiven the board, they may have Qx, 8x, 6x, 5x. They could have a queen, a pair, a straight draw, etc. Checking could be a trap or weak.\n\nBetting 11 into 44 is about 1/4 pot. Could be a probe bet. Raising could be seen as aggression, but we have weak hand. Might be okay to check and see river.\n\nThus choose check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. Folding not applicable because no bet. So choose check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

We have 9, board 8,6,5, Q, A. Not a straight. Could have gutshot? No. No flush (two spades: 9s, 6s, plus board has spades? Qs and 6s are spades, we have 9s, that's three spades, need five).

Could we bluff? River check from opponent suggests they are weak. Could we bet to steal? But legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 11. Pot 44, so raise to 11 would be small, raise to 55? Actually raise to 11 total? Minimum raise is 11, meaning you must raise to at least 11 chips total (i.e., raise by 11?). Usually raise_to is total amount. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 11 would be a bet of 11. That's a small bet (1/4 pot). Could be a bluff.\n\nBut we have Kc9s, not a good showdown value.

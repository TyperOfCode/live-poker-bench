So pot after call: 79 + 20*2 = 119? Actually pot before flop: 79. Then bet 20 (seat1) + call 20 (seat4) = 40 added, so pot 119. We face bet 20, we can call, raise to at least 40 total (i.e., raise by 20). Need to consider hand strength: Kc Qh is overcards, but board is low, no straight draws yet (5-6-2). Potential draws: 4-3 gives straight, also 7-8? Actually 5-6 need 4-3 or 7-8. Our hand KQ doesn't help. Opponent likely has range: preflop they raised from seat1 after 4-raise from seat4 and our call. Preflop action: Seat4 raised 4 (open raise), we called, seat1 (Kimi) re-raised to 12 (3-bet). Then seat4 and us called. So seat1's 3-bet range likely strong: maybe broadway combos, AK, AQ, AA, KK, maybe suited connectors. Postflop, they bet 20 into pot 79 (about 25% pot) on a low board. Could be continuation bet with many hands. Our KQ has showdown value if opponent has pair lower than K, but we have no pair yet. Potential to improve on turn/river. But calling 20 adds 20 to pot of 119, odds ~20/139 = 14.4% needed. Our equity? With KQ vs unknown range maybe 30%? Might be okay to call. But also consider stack sizes: we have 188, opponent 168, seat4 168. All relatively shallow. Could consider raising to protect? But we have no made hand, raising may be too aggressive.\n\nOpponent seat1 may be aggressive; we could call to see turn.\n\nCheck legal actions: fold, call, raise. I think call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

The actions show: Seat5 post_sb 1, Seat1 post_bb 2. So seat5 is SB (small blind) and seat1 is BB (big blind). But our position is BB (Seat5). However actions show seat5 posted small blind. Something inconsistent. Probably seat5 is SB because they posted 1, seat1 posted BB 2. But the description says your position: BB (Seat5). Maybe they swapped? Let's trust the given position: BB seat5, posted 2? But actions show post_sb 1. Might be error. Regardless, amount to call is 1, meaning we need to call the raise? Actually after blinds, there is no raise yet. Since we are BB, we already posted 2, but amount to call is 1 (the small blind). So we need to act after SB? Actually order: SB posts 1, BB posts 2, then action goes to player after BB, which would be seat2, but they folded, seat3 folded, seat4 folded, seat5 (us) is BB already posted, but we are last to act preflop? In heads-up, SB acts first preflop, then BB. So after SB posted 1, BB posted 2, and it's BB's turn? Actually SB posted 1, then BB posted 2, then action goes to SB first to act (since SB is first to act preflop). But the actions show seat2,3,4 folded, then amount to call 1, meaning we need to call 1 to match SB? That suggests we are the player after seat4 (who folded) and now it's our turn to act, with amount to call 1 (i.e., we can check (since we are BB already posted 2) or raise. But legal actions include fold, call, raise. \"call\" would be to call 1 more (i.e., total 3) making us effectively raise? Wait if we are BB, we have already posted 2. To call the SB's 1, we would just check (no additional chips). But the system says amount to call 1, meaning we need to put in 1 more to match? That's typical for when we are in the big blind and the small blind raised? But small blind didn't raise. So maybe the SB raised to 3 (i.e., 1 extra)? Actually amount to call = 1 suggests a raise of 1 over the BB? But min raise to =4. So the current bet is 3? Let's parse: The pot currently is 3 chips (SB 1 + BB 2). Amount to call is 1, meaning if we want to call, we need to put 1 more, making the total bet 3 (matching the SB? No, SB posted 1, we posted 2, so we are ahead). Actually typical scenario: SB posts 1, BB posts 2, then action goes to SB first: they can check (call 0) or raise. If SB checks, then action goes to BB, and amount to call is 0 (BB can check). But here amount to call is 1, meaning SB must have raised to 3 (i.e., added 2 more). But min raise to is 4, which would be a raise to 4 total? Wait min raise to = 4 means the minimum total bet after a raise is 4. So current bet is 2 (big blind). To raise, must go to at least 4. So amount to call = 1 means we need to call 1 more to match a bet of 3? That doesn't align with min raise to 4. Something off.\n\nMaybe the system defines amount to call as the amount we need to put in to call the current bet, which is currently 3 (SB's raise to 3). The BB already has 2 in, so need 1 more. Minimum raise to 4 means we can raise to 4 (i.e., add 1 more beyond call). So legal actions: fold, call (i.e., call 1 more), raise (to at least 4). So SB must have raised to 3. That seems plausible.\n\nThus we are facing a raise from SB (seat5? Actually seat5 is us). Wait seat5 posted SB 1, seat1 posted BB 2, but we are seat5. So seat"

Not sure.\n\nGiven the tiny raise, the pot is small. 6Js suited is a decent hand to see a flop in position. We are in BB (maybe out of position after raise). Since it's a small raise, we could call (i.e., just match) and see flop cheap. With 165 stack, risk is low. Also 6Js has some straight and flush potential. Should we raise? Raising to 4 (min raise) would be 2 chips extra, not much. Could also just call.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: In hand1 they raised to 12 preflop (big raise) indicating they may be capable of larger raises. But this time they only raised to 3 (small).

Actually we have J high, no pair. Board: 4-4-10-K-? Wait board includes 4h Td 2s Kd 4d. So we have a pair of 4s on board (two 4s). Our hand does not improve; we have a gutshot to a straight? Board: 4-4-10-K-4. No straight possible. Our J doesn't help. So we have nothing, likely a losing hand. Opponent (Seat1) checked both preflop, flop, turn. So they have checked to river. Now river also check? Actually amount to call 0, so they have checked. We can either check or raise. Raising is possible but likely a bluff. Opponent stack 166 chips, pot is 4 chips. Very small pot. Our stack 164. This is a tournament early stage? We have 82 BB. Opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking, maybe a decent player. Since pot is tiny, a raise would be a bluff, but risk minimal because small pot. However we might want to just check and see showdown, losing anyway. But maybe we could attempt a small raise to steal? But they may call with any pair. They have checked, maybe they have a weak hand. But we have nothing. Might be better to check to avoid losing more chips. Since pot is only 4, raising to 2 (minimum) would risk 2 chips. If they call, we lose 2 anyway. If they fold, we win 4. So EV: probability opponent folds * 4 - probability they call * 2. Need estimate of fold probability. Given they checked all the way, they could be weak (e.g., missed the board). Could be a medium pair like 4x, but they'd have 4s maybe they'd check? With a pair of 4s they'd have a set? Actually board has two 4s, so a set would be three of a kind, they'd have a 4. They might check with a set? Usually they'd bet. So maybe they have a weak hand like a high card, maybe they check. So bluff could work. But also could be a draw? Not possible. So maybe decent chance to fold.\n\nGiven tournament, small risk, could raise to 2 (minimum). Let's consider we have 164 chips, but raising 2 is negligible. Could attempt to steal. I'll raise to 2.\n\nWe need to ensure raise_to is total amount we put in. Currently we have 0 in pot, pot is 4. Minimum raise to 2 means we need to put total 2 chips (i.e., bet 2). So raise_to: 2.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So you are middle stack. Should we play? Ts8c off-suit is generally a fold in early position, especially out of position. However there is a call already from seat 4 (likely MP).

Actually two players with same name maybe two different AI clones? Both Kimi-K2 but different seats. Both have similar stack sizes.\n\nWe need to decide action. Preflop from BTN with K6 offsuit. This is a weak hand, generally fold unless we can steal blinds. The SB is 1 chip, BB 2 chips. We are facing 2 to call (just BB). Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise by at least 2). So options: fold, call (call 2), raise to 4 or more.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: recall shows Kimi-K2 (both seats) have raised preflop to 6 in previous hands (hand numbers 6,7,8). That suggests they are aggressive and may raise from early position? But here they are SB and BB, not raising now; they just posted blinds. So they have not raised. They might be willing to defend blinds or call raises. Our hand is not strong; raising may get called by BB and SB who could have decent hands. But we could attempt to steal; however K6 is weak; risk of being called and we are out of position post-flop (but we are BTN, so we will be last to act preflop, but after flop we will be first to act). Actually BTN is last preflop, but after flop we will be first (under the gun). So not great.\n\nStack depth: 165 chips, deep enough. Tournament stage unknown but blinds are 1/2, stacks ~80 BB, deep.\n\nThus best to fold. Or we could call to see flop cheap? But 6K offsuit is not a good hand. Better to preserve stack.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

No straight draws: we have 8, board K T 5, we have potential gutshot to 9? Actually 8 could give straight with 6-7-9? Not. So basically just Ace high. Opponent's range: preflop raiser likely strong: could have Kx, QJ, AQ, AK, TT, etc. Callers: seat 4 called raise, likely broad range. Our hand is weak. Likely we should check/fold to any bet. Since legal actions: fold, check, raise. Check is appropriate. But maybe consider raising as bluff? With 79.5 BB stack, pot 18, we could try steal? But board is K T 5, we have no equity. Raising could be risky if opponent has Kx etc. Better to check and possibly fold to bet.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: BB has 8s Ac. Board: Kc Td 5h 9d. So we have Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: board Kc Td 5h 9d. Straight possibilities: A-? Actually we have Ace, board includes Ten, Nine, King, Five. Ace gives wheel? Not. We have potential straight draw: 8-9-10-J-Q? No J missing. So we have gutshot: need a Jack to make straight 9-T-J-Q-K? Actually board has K, T, 5, 9. So possible straight with Ace? No. We have a gutshot draw: need a 7 to make 5-6-7-8-9? Not, we have 8, board has 5,9,10,K. 8-9-10-J-Q? Need J. So not.\n\nWe have Ace high, maybe a backdoor flush? Suits: board: Kc (clubs), Td (diamonds), 5h (hearts), 9d (diamonds). Our hand: 8s Ac (spades, clubs). So we have Ace of clubs, giving us a flush draw? There's only one club on board (Kc). Need two more clubs to make flush, but only one more club in hand, so we have 2 clubs total (Kc and Ac). Need 3 more clubs on turn and river, impossible. So no flush draw.\n\nThus our hand is just Ace high, no pair, no draw. Opponent (Seat 3 DeepSeek-V3.2) is the only remaining opponent? Actually seats: Seat 4 MiniMax-M2 also still in hand? Let's see actions: preflop: Seat 4 post_sb 1 (small blind), Seat 5 post_bb 2, Seat 3 raise 6, Seat 4 call 5, Seat 5 call 4. So three players in pot: DeepSeek (Seat 3) raised preflop, MiniMax (Seat 4) called, GPT (Seat5) called. Flop: Seat 4 check, Seat5 check, Seat3 check. Turn: Seat4 check. So after turn check, it's our turn (Seat5). So still three players active: DeepSeek (Seat3) hasn't acted on turn yet? Actually order: On turn, after flop, order is from small blind? Typically action starts with first active player left of button. Seats: 1 and 2 folded, seat3 (DeepSeek) is UTG? Actually seat numbers: 1,2,3,4,5. Seat5 is BB, seat4 is SB, seat3 is UTG. After flop, first to act is seat3 (UTG) then seat4 then seat5. But we see flop actions: seat4 check, seat5 check, seat3 check. That order seems off; maybe they act clockwise starting from seat4 (SB) then seat5 (BB) then seat3 (UTG). So on turn, seat4 check, then it's seat5's turn (us). So DeepSeek hasn't acted on turn yet? Actually seat3 would act after seat5. So we need to decide now.\n\nWe have Ace high, board is fairly coordinated: Kc Td 5h 9d. Potential draws: Straight draws: 8-9-10-J-Q? No J. 7-8-9-10-J? Need 8 and J. We have 8, so need J. So we have open-ended? Actually we have 8 and board 9-10, so we have 8-9-10, need 7 or J for straight. So we have a gutshot (need 7) or open-ended (need J)?? Let's examine: cards: 8,9,10. That's a 8-9-10 sequence. To make a straight, need either 7-8-9-10-J? Wait need 5 cards. With 8,9,10 we need either 6-7 (to make 6-7-8-9-10) or J-Q (to make 8-9-10-J-Q). But board also has K and 5. So not. So we have open-ended? Actually we have 8,9,10, need 7 or J for straight. So open-ended (both sides) but missing two cards? No, need one card either 7 or J. So we have an open-ended straight draw (8-9-10). So we need a 7 or J on river to complete straight. That's 8 outs (four 7s, four Js) but some may be dead: we have Ace of clubs, 8 of spades. So 7s and Js are all available"

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: BB has 8s Ac. Board: Kc Td 5h 9d. So we have Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: board Kc Td 5h 9d. Straight possibilities: A-? Actually we have Ace, board includes Ten, Nine, King, Five. Ace gives wheel? Not. We have potential straight draw: 8-9-10-J-Q? No J missing. So we have gutshot: need a Jack to make straight 9-T-J-Q-K? Actually board has K, T, 5, 9. So possible straight with Ace? No. We have a gutshot draw: need a 7 to make 5-6-7-8-9? Not, we have 8, board has 5,9,10,K. 8-9-10-J-Q? Need J. So not.\n\nWe have Ace high, maybe a backdoor flush? Suits: board: Kc (clubs), Td (diamonds), 5h (hearts), 9d (diamonds). Our hand: 8s Ac (spades, clubs). So we have Ace of clubs, giving us a flush draw? There's only one club on board (Kc). Need two more clubs to make flush, but only one more club in hand, so we have 2 clubs total (Kc and Ac). Need 3 more clubs on turn and river, impossible. So no flush draw.\n\nThus our hand is just Ace high, no pair, no draw. Opponent (Seat 3 DeepSeek-V3.2) is the only remaining opponent? Actually seats: Seat 4 MiniMax-M2 also still in hand? Let's see actions: preflop: Seat 4 post_sb 1 (small blind), Seat 5 post_bb 2, Seat 3 raise 6, Seat 4 call 5, Seat 5 call 4. So three players in pot: DeepSeek (Seat 3) raised preflop, MiniMax (Seat 4) called, GPT (Seat5) called. Flop: Seat 4 check, Seat5 check, Seat3 check. Turn: Seat4 check. So after turn check, it's our turn (Seat5). So still three players active: DeepSeek (Seat3) hasn't acted on turn yet? Actually order: On turn, after flop, order is from small blind? Typically action starts with first active player left of button. Seats: 1 and 2 folded, seat3 (DeepSeek) is UTG? Actually seat numbers: 1,2,3,4,5. Seat5 is BB, seat4 is SB, seat3 is UTG. After flop, first to act is seat3 (UTG) then seat4 then seat5. But we see flop actions: seat4 check, seat5 check, seat3 check. That order seems off; maybe they act clockwise starting from seat4 (SB) then seat5 (BB) then seat3 (UTG). So on turn, seat4 check, then it's seat5's turn (us). So DeepSeek hasn't acted on turn yet? Actually seat3 would act after seat5. So we need to decide now.\n\nWe have Ace high, board is fairly coordinated: Kc Td 5h 9d. Potential draws: Straight draws: 8-9-10-J-Q? No J. 7-8-9-10-J? Need 8 and J. We have 8, so need J. So we have open-ended? Actually we have 8 and board 9-10, so we have 8-9-10, need 7 or J for straight. So we have a gutshot (need 7) or open-ended (need J)?? Let's examine: cards: 8,9,10. That's a 8-9-10 sequence. To make a straight, need either 7-8-9-10-J? Wait need 5 cards. With 8,9,10 we need either 6-7 (to make 6-7-8-9-10) or J-Q (to make 8-9-10-J-Q). But board also has K and 5. So not. So we have open-ended? Actually we have 8,9,10, need 7 or J for straight. So open-ended (both sides) but missing two cards? No, need one card either 7 or J. So we have an open-ended straight draw (8-9-10). So we need a 7 or J on river to complete straight. That's 8 outs (four 7s, four Js) but some may be dead: we have Ace of clubs, 8 of spades. So 7s and Js are all available",

We have 8, board has 9, T, so we need 7 and 6? Actually to make straight with 8 we need 6-7-9-10? Wait compute: possible straights that include Ace? No. With Ace we could have A-K-Q-J-10 but board has K and T, missing Q,J. Not possible. With 8 we could have 5-6-7-8-9 (board has 5 and 9). Need 6 and 7. Also could have 6-7-8-9-10 (board has 9 and T). Need 6 and 7. So we have gutshot? Actually need both 6 and 7, two cards, not a draw. So no immediate draw. So currently we have Ace high, K high on board. The opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 12 on turn after checks. Pot before bet: 42. He bet 12, making pot 54 (including his bet). We have to call 12 to see river. Our stack 159, so 12 is small. Evaluate opponent's range: Preflop he raised to 6 from UTG? Actually seat 3 (DeepSeek) raised 6 preflop. Likely a strong range: broadway, maybe AK, AQ, KQ, maybe some suited connectors, maybe pairs. He called the small blind (seat 4) and we called. So preflop we have AA? Actually we have A8. So preflop we called 4 after raise 6 and small blind call. So we are in a pot with him. Flop: board Kc Td 5h. He checked, we checked, small blind checked. So he checked with a range that includes missed overcards, maybe Kx, T9 combos, etc. Turn: 9d appears, giving board Kc Td 5h 9d. He bets 12, small amount. Could be value bet with K9, T9, 99, 9T, maybe a pair, maybe a straight draw? Actually board now has a pair of 9? No 9 appears only now, so no pair yet. He could have K9 (top pair), T9 (two pair?), Actually board: K T 5 9. With T9 he has two pair (T and 9). With K9 he has top pair (K). With 9x combos. Also could have a straight draw like 7-8? Not yet. Could be a bluff. Small bet suggests maybe a weak hand or a probe.\n\nOur hand: Ace high, no pair. So we are likely behind any pair. But we could have a hidden Ace that could become best if opponent has Kx? Actually if opponent has Kx, we lose to pair of K. If opponent has T, we lose. So likely losing.\n\nPot odds: need to call 12 to win pot of 54+12? Actually after his bet, pot is 42 +12 (his bet) =54, plus we call 12 to see river, final pot 66. So we need 12/66 = 18% equity. That's low. But we have no chance to improve to best hand except hitting an Ace (makes pair of A) or hitting a straight? Ace on river would give us pair of A, which would beat K, T, 9? Actually Ace would be top pair, beating K? Actually board K T 5 9, Ace pairs our Ace, making A pair, which beats K, T, 9. So Ace is a winning river card. Also a 8 would give us a pair of 8, still not best vs K or T. So only Ace wins (maybe also a 6 or 7? Would make a straight? Let's see: If river is 7, board K T 5 9 7: we have A8, still no straight. If river is 6, board K T 5 9 6, we have A8, still no straight. So only Ace makes pair, maybe also a 8? 8 would give pair of 8, still lose. So only Ace improves to best, maybe also a 9? Actually if river is 9, board becomes pair of 9s, we have Ace high still lose to any 9? Opponent could have 9, but we would still lose. So only Ace is winning, maybe also a K? Actually K would give opponent two pair, still"

          "reasoning_content": "We have a turn scenario. Our hand: 8s Ac. Board: Kc Td 5h 9d. So we have Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Board: K T 5 9. We have A8. Straight possibilities: 6-7-8-9-10? We have 8, board has 9, T, so we need 7 and 6? Actually to make straight with 8 we need 6-7-9-10? Wait compute: possible straights that include Ace? No. With Ace we could have A-K-Q-J-10 but board has K and T, missing Q,J. Not possible. With 8 we could have 5-6-7-8-9 (board has 5 and 9). Need 6 and 7. Also could have 6-7-8-9-10 (board has 9 and T). Need 6 and 7. So we have gutshot? Actually need both 6 and 7, two cards, not a draw. So no immediate draw. So currently we have Ace high, K high on board. The opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 12 on turn after checks. Pot before bet: 42. He bet 12, making pot 54 (including his bet). We have to call 12 to see river. Our stack 159, so 12 is small. Evaluate opponent's range: Preflop he raised to 6 from UTG? Actually seat 3 (DeepSeek) raised 6 preflop. Likely a strong range: broadway, maybe AK, AQ, KQ, maybe some suited connectors, maybe pairs. He called the small blind (seat 4) and we called. So preflop we have AA? Actually we have A8. So preflop we called 4 after raise 6 and small blind call. So we are in a pot with him. Flop: board Kc Td 5h. He checked, we checked, small blind checked. So he checked with a range that includes missed overcards, maybe Kx, T9 combos, etc. Turn: 9d appears, giving board Kc Td 5h 9d. He bets 12, small amount. Could be value bet with K9, T9, 99, 9T, maybe a pair, maybe a straight draw? Actually board now has a pair of 9? No 9 appears only now, so no pair yet. He could have K9 (top pair), T9 (two pair?), Actually board: K T 5 9. With T9 he has two pair (T and 9). With K9 he has top pair (K). With 9x combos. Also could have a straight draw like 7-8? Not yet. Could be a bluff. Small bet suggests maybe a weak hand or a probe.\n\nOur hand: Ace high, no pair. So we are likely behind any pair. But we could have a hidden Ace that could become best if opponent has Kx? Actually if opponent has Kx, we lose to pair of K. If opponent has T, we lose. So likely losing.\n\nPot odds: need to call 12 to win pot of 54+12? Actually after his bet, pot is 42 +12 (his bet) =54, plus we call 12 to see river, final pot 66. So we need 12/66 = 18% equity. That's low. But we have no chance to improve to best hand except hitting an Ace (makes pair of A) or hitting a straight? Ace on river would give us pair of A, which would beat K, T, 9? Actually Ace would be top pair, beating K? Actually board K T 5 9, Ace pairs our Ace, making A pair, which beats K, T, 9. So Ace is a winning river card. Also a 8 would give us a pair of 8, still not best vs K or T. So only Ace wins (maybe also a 6 or 7? Would make a straight? Let's see: If river is 7, board K T 5 9 7: we have A8, still no straight. If river is 6, board K T 5 9 6, we have A8, still no straight. So only Ace makes pair, maybe also a 8? 8 would give pair of 8, still lose. So only Ace improves to best, maybe also a 9? Actually if river is 9, board becomes pair of 9s, we have Ace high still lose to any 9? Opponent could have 9, but we would still lose. So only Ace is winning, maybe also a K? Actually K would give opponent two pair, still",

Actually we are BB, so we have posted 2, the SB posted 1, so the amount to call is 1 to match the SB's bet? Wait: In BB position, after SB posts 1, BB posts 2, then action is to act. The amount to call is 1 (the SB's bet). So we can call 1 to see flop, raise minimum to 4 (i.e., total 4 chips put in). Hand is Kc4c, suited King four. That's a weak hand, suited King low kicker. In BB with 79 BB stack, should we call? Typically K4 suited is a speculative hand, can limp or raise. But with deep stacks, raising is often advisable to avoid multi-way. However we are short stack? Actually 79 BB is deep. So we could raise to 4 (minimum raise) to try to isolate, but K4 suited is not great. Could also call and see flop cheap.\n\nConsider opponent: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 212 chips. He posted big blind. He is the only opponent left (others folded). So it's heads-up preflop: SB is seat 1? Wait seat 1 posted SB 1. Seat 5 is BB. So after SB posts 1, BB posted 2. So we are in BB with Kc4c. The only other player is SB (Seat 1). He hasn't acted yet? Actually after posting blinds, the action starts with UTG, but all others folded, so SB acts first preflop. The actions list shows only blinds posted, no other actions. So it's now SB's turn to act. Actually the order: after blinds, first player to act is UTG (seat 2) but folded, seat 3 folded, seat 4 folded, then SB (seat 1) acts, then BB (seat 5). The actions list doesn't show SB's action yet; we are at BB's decision point after SB's action? The list shows only posting blinds. So it's SB's turn? Wait \"Amount to call: 1\" suggests SB has bet 1 (i.e., just posted SB). In BB's perspective, amount to call is the SB's bet of 1. So SB hasn't acted beyond posting blind. So BB can call 1 (i.e., just check the blind? Actually to call the SB's bet, you need to put 1 more chip (since you already have 2 in pot). So you can either call 1 and see flop, raise to 4 (minimum raise) which would be total 4 chips from BB (i.e., you add 2 more chips beyond your blind? Actually you have 2 in pot, to raise to 4 you need total 4, so you need to put additional 2 chips). So raise amount is 2 extra.\n\nGiven K4 suited, I'd likely just call (i.e., just check) and see flop cheap, because raising may get 3-bet and we are out of position anyway. But we are BB, which is out of position postflop (SB will be first to act). So maybe we want to limp (call) and see flop cheap.\n\nBut also consider tournament: we have decent stack, but not huge. K4 suited has some flush and straight potential, but not strong.\n\nThus best action: call (i.e., just match 1 chip). So we respond with action \"call\", raise_to null.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We are on flop. Board: Kh 9d Qc. Our hand: 4c Kc. So we have top pair (K) with a flush draw? Actually we have clubs: 4c Kc gives us Kc on board, plus we have flush draw? Board clubs: Qc only, plus we have Kc, 4c, that's two clubs. Need 3 more clubs for flush, not yet. Straight draw? Board: K Q 9, we have 4, not helpful. So we have top pair, decent kicker (4). Opponent is Kimi-K2, seat 1 is BB (they posted big blind). Actually seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, they are BB, they checked preflop. So we are in BB, we called the small blind preflop, they checked. So flop action: they are first to act (since they are in BB). The legal actions: we have amount to call 0, min raise to 2. So we can check or raise. Need to decide.\n\nWe should consider opponent's tendencies: we have recall of a previous flop bet from Kimi-K2 in hand 6: they bet 8 on flop. That suggests they can bet on flop. But we need more context: what board was that? unknown. But they are capable of betting.\n\nNow board is K Q 9, giving straight possibilities: A J would be straight, also 10 J would be straight? Actually board K Q 9, a straight would be J 10? Let's see: 9-10-J-Q-K is a straight. So if opponent has J10, they have straight. Also they could have A K? Actually AK would be two pair? Not straight. So there are many combos.\n\nOur hand is Kc 4c: top pair, but vulnerable to overpairs (AA, QQ, JJ) and straight draws. Also we have backdoor flush draw (two clubs). Pot is 4 chips. Stack sizes: opponent 212 chips, we 157. So it's early stage. We could consider raising to protect and get value from worse hands (like AQ, Kx, QJ? Actually QJ would be second pair? QJ has Q pair, but we have K pair, we are ahead of QJ? Actually board K Q 9, QJ has Q pair, we have K pair, we are ahead. But also we could be behind to straight draws.\n\nWe can also check, see what they do. If they bet, we can call or raise. If they check, we can bet.\n\nGiven we have top pair, decent kicker, we could lead out to protect. Minimum raise is 2 (to total 2). That seems small relative to pot (4). A raise to maybe 6? But we can only raise to any amount up to our stack. Should we raise? If we raise to 6 (total), that's 2 more than call? Actually amount to call is 0, min raise to 2. So raise to 2 means we put 2 chips total. That's small. Could be effective to protect. Opponent may call with draws.\n\nGiven opponent's previous flop bet of 8 (maybe big) suggests they may bet big when they have strong hand. But we don't know.\n\nWe might want to check to see if they bet. If they bet, we can call or raise. If they check, we could bet.\n\nGiven pot is small, we could check and evaluate later. But we have top pair; checking may give them free card to improve.\n\nI think raising now is good: raise to maybe 6 chips (total). That is 1.5 BB. That puts pressure.\n\nOur stack 157, opponent 212, both deep enough. Raising to 6 gives pot odds for opponent to call with draws.\n\nThus decision: raise to 6.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\n",

However UTG with 8-9 offsuit is not great, but many players call such hands in early stage. But we need to consider risk: if we call, we will be out of position postflop. Hand has potential for straights but not great.\n\nGiven the guidelines: we need to think step by step. Might be better to fold to preserve stack.\n\nLet's maybe recall opponent actions: seat2 (SB) maybe a loose player. But we are not facing them yet. The BB posted 2, but they might be tight. Not sure.\n\nGiven the hand, I think fold.\n\nThus output JSON with action fold, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Board: 2-5-6, we have 7, so we have a gutshot straight draw (needs 4 for straight 2-3-4-5-6? Actually we have 5,6,7, we need 4 or 8 for open-ended? Let's see: Our cards 5 and 7, board 2,6,5.

We could check or raise. What is opponent's tendencies? Past data shows they check flop often (3 times). No raises. Likely a passive player. Our hand is medium strength. Could we bet to take pot? With pair of fives, board is fairly dry (no flush draw, only two spades on board). There's potential for opponent having overpairs (6s? Actually board 6, they could have 6x). Also could have 2x, 5x, etc. Our pair is low. Might be okay to check and see turn.\n\nGiven we have a decent stack and pot small, risk minimal. Raising could build pot if we think we have best hand, but risk if opponent has higher pair (6s) or 2s, etc. Since opponent is passive, maybe we can take a small bet to protect against draws (though none). A raise to 2 (minimum) would be 2 chips extra, pot becomes 6. That could be fine.\n\nBut we also have to consider tournament: we have deep stack, can afford to see next card. Checking is safe.\n\nThus choose check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. No call needed.\n\nDecision: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 2 into pot 10, we have to call 2. Stack sizes: we have 157 chips, opponent likely similar but unknown. Pot after turn: pre-turn pot was? Let's compute: Preflop: both posted blinds, pot 3? Actually small blind 1, big blind 2, plus call 1 from SB? Wait actions: Seat4 post_sb 1 (small blind), Seat5 post_bb 2 (big blind). Then seat4 call 1 (so SB called extra 1 to match BB? Actually after posting SB 1, BB 2, the SB would need to call 1 more to match BB, which they did.

So we are being offered 2 to call to win 10 (current pot before our call) i.e., pot odds: 2 / (10+2?) Actually we call 2 to win pot 10 (since opponent's bet already in pot). So pot odds = 2/(10+2?) Wait typical: you call 2, total pot you win is 10 (including opponent's bet) + your call? Actually pot after opponent's bet is 10 (8+2). If you call 2, you add 2 making pot 12, you win 12.

Preflop they posted SB 1 and called 1 (so they are small blind). So they are SB. They bet small amounts throughout: turn bet 2, river bet 2. That suggests they may be checking or betting small with weak hand, maybe trying to steal? Could be a continuation bet with missed draws, or a weak made hand like Ace-high (they have A? board has Ace already). Actually board Ace is on board, so they cannot have Ace. They could have Q? Board has Q, so they could have Q? Actually board Qs, so they could have Qx for pair of queens. They could have Ace? Already on board. So they could have flush draw spades, but they'd bet small.\n\nOur hand: pair of fives, low pair. Opponent could have higher pair (Queens, Aces? Ace not possible). Could have Q? Actually board Qs, so they could have Qx for pair of queens (top pair). Could also have 2 pair like Q-A? Actually board has A and Q, they could have A? Ace on board, they could have A? Actually board includes Ace, so they could have Ace with something else, making pair of Aces (top pair). They could also have 2 pair like A-Q? But board only has one Ace and one Queen each, they could have Ace and Queen for two pair (A+Q). That's strong.\n\nGiven they bet small 2 into pot 8 (25% of pot), maybe they are weak or drawing.\n\nOur hand has showdown value: we have pair of 5s, which is likely the worst hand on this board. Many hands beat us: any Ace, any Queen, any 6 (makes pair of 6s), any 2 (pair of 2s), any spade flush (if they have two spades), any straight? Not possible. So likely we are behind most.\n\nThus folding seems correct.\n\nBut pot odds are good: call 2 to win 10, but equity is probably low (<10%).

          "content": "We have turn with board: 9h 9d Kd 5d. Our hand Qd 8d. So we have a flush draw (diamonds) with Qd8d, currently 4 diamonds on board (9h,9d,Kd,5d) actually 3 diamonds: 9d, Kd,5d. So we have 4 diamonds total (Qd,8d plus 3). Need one more diamond for flush. Also have gutshot? Straight draws? Board: 9,9,K,5. Our Q8 doesn't give straight. So only flush draw. Also we have backdoor possibilities maybe.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 checked turn. So they have checked after flop check. Preflop they called small blind? Actually preflop: seat4 post_sb 2 (small blind), seat5 post_bb 4 (big blind). Then seat4 call 2 (so they just called SB? Wait seat4 is SB, posted 2, then called 2? Actually they posted SB 2, then call 2 to match big blind? So they are playing a limp? So they are passive preflop. Flop check both. Turn check. So opponent seems passive, maybe weak hand or drawing. They have checked multiple streets, indicating maybe not strong.\n\nOur stack 152, pot 8. Turn action: amount to call 0. Minimum raise 4. So we can check or raise. With a flush draw, we could try to semi-bluff. But opponent is passive; raising could win pot now (8) or build pot for when we hit flush.\n\nConsider effective stack: both have similar stacks? Opponent's stack unknown but likely similar (they have 215 chips). So raising to 4 (total) is small, 4 is min raise (i.e., raise to 4? Actually raise_to total amount). The pot is 8, we would raise to 4 total? That seems weird because raising to 4 is less than pot, but min raise is 4 (maybe raise to 8?). Usually min raise is current bet + 2*big blind? But they say min raise to 4, meaning raise total to 4 chips? Since amount to call is 0, raising to 4 means we put 4 chips in. So pot becomes 12.\n\nWe could also raise larger to apply pressure. But we have only 152 chips, not huge.\n\nGiven we have a flush draw with 9 outs (13 diamonds total, we have 2, board 3, so 8? Actually there are 13 diamonds, we hold Qd and 8d, board has 9d, Kd,5d = 3, so remaining diamonds = 13 - (2+3) = 8 outs). Turn to river, we have one card left, chance = 8/46 \u2248 17.4%. Pot odds: If we raise to 4, opponent may call. If they call, they'd invest 4 to win pot maybe 12+4? Actually pot after our raise would be 8 + 4 =12, opponent would call 4 making pot 16, we have 4 in, they have 4. So pot odds for us to call a bet would be different. But we are raising.\n\nWe could also check, see river. River will be one card; we could get flush 17% chance. Pot 8, if we check and opponent checks, we go to showdown with Qd8d vs unknown. Likely lose unless they have pair of 9s, K, etc. Our hand is weak, only a draw.\n\nBetter to try to steal the pot with a semi-bluff. Since opponent is passive, they may fold to raise. So raise to 4 (or maybe larger). But we need to consider tournament: we have 38 BB, comfortable. Raising small may get called; if called, we are not getting good odds (8% chance to improve, need pot odds > 5:1). If they call, pot 16, we have 4 in, need odds 4:1? Actually we need to be ahead after we hit. If we hit flush, we likely win. Expected value: probability 0.174 * (pot after call = 16) - (1-0.174)*(4) = 0.174*16 - 0.826*4 = 2.784 - 3.304 = -0.52. Slight negative. So raising to 4 may be slightly negative if called.\n\nIf we raise larger, say all-in 152? Opponent likely folds, we win 8 chips. Not worth risking many chips. But we could raise to maybe 20 chips to pressure. If opponent calls, pot becomes 8+20=28, they call 20, pot 48. EV"

          "reasoning_content": "We have turn with board: 9h 9d Kd 5d. Our hand Qd 8d. So we have a flush draw (diamonds) with Qd8d, currently 4 diamonds on board (9h,9d,Kd,5d) actually 3 diamonds: 9d, Kd,5d. So we have 4 diamonds total (Qd,8d plus 3). Need one more diamond for flush. Also have gutshot? Straight draws? Board: 9,9,K,5. Our Q8 doesn't give straight. So only flush draw. Also we have backdoor possibilities maybe.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 checked turn. So they have checked after flop check. Preflop they called small blind? Actually preflop: seat4 post_sb 2 (small blind), seat5 post_bb 4 (big blind). Then seat4 call 2 (so they just called SB? Wait seat4 is SB, posted 2, then called 2? Actually they posted SB 2, then call 2 to match big blind? So they are playing a limp? So they are passive preflop. Flop check both. Turn check. So opponent seems passive, maybe weak hand or drawing. They have checked multiple streets, indicating maybe not strong.\n\nOur stack 152, pot 8. Turn action: amount to call 0. Minimum raise 4. So we can check or raise. With a flush draw, we could try to semi-bluff. But opponent is passive; raising could win pot now (8) or build pot for when we hit flush.\n\nConsider effective stack: both have similar stacks? Opponent's stack unknown but likely similar (they have 215 chips). So raising to 4 (total) is small, 4 is min raise (i.e., raise to 4? Actually raise_to total amount). The pot is 8, we would raise to 4 total? That seems weird because raising to 4 is less than pot, but min raise is 4 (maybe raise to 8?). Usually min raise is current bet + 2*big blind? But they say min raise to 4, meaning raise total to 4 chips? Since amount to call is 0, raising to 4 means we put 4 chips in. So pot becomes 12.\n\nWe could also raise larger to apply pressure. But we have only 152 chips, not huge.\n\nGiven we have a flush draw with 9 outs (13 diamonds total, we have 2, board 3, so 8? Actually there are 13 diamonds, we hold Qd and 8d, board has 9d, Kd,5d = 3, so remaining diamonds = 13 - (2+3) = 8 outs). Turn to river, we have one card left, chance = 8/46 \u2248 17.4%. Pot odds: If we raise to 4, opponent may call. If they call, they'd invest 4 to win pot maybe 12+4? Actually pot after our raise would be 8 + 4 =12, opponent would call 4 making pot 16, we have 4 in, they have 4. So pot odds for us to call a bet would be different. But we are raising.\n\nWe could also check, see river. River will be one card; we could get flush 17% chance. Pot 8, if we check and opponent checks, we go to showdown with Qd8d vs unknown. Likely lose unless they have pair of 9s, K, etc. Our hand is weak, only a draw.\n\nBetter to try to steal the pot with a semi-bluff. Since opponent is passive, they may fold to raise. So raise to 4 (or maybe larger). But we need to consider tournament: we have 38 BB, comfortable. Raising small may get called; if called, we are not getting good odds (8% chance to improve, need pot odds > 5:1). If they call, pot 16, we have 4 in, need odds 4:1? Actually we need to be ahead after we hit. If we hit flush, we likely win. Expected value: probability 0.174 * (pot after call = 16) - (1-0.174)*(4) = 0.174*16 - 0.826*4 = 2.784 - 3.304 = -0.52. Slight negative. So raising to 4 may be slightly negative if called.\n\nIf we raise larger, say all-in 152? Opponent likely folds, we win 8 chips. Not worth risking many chips. But we could raise to maybe 20 chips to pressure. If opponent calls, pot becomes 8+20=28, they call 20, pot 48. EV",

Action: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, seat4 (MiniMax-M2) calls 4 (so they just called). Amount to call is 2 (SB's to call the BB's 4? Actually SB posted 2, BB posted 4, seat4 called 4, so SB now needs to call 2 more to match 4). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to total 8). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Hand JsKd suited? No, Js of spades, Kd diamond, unsuited. In SB, we are out of position, short stack? 39.5 BB, not short. J\u2660 K\u2666 is a decent hand, decent equity vs random, but against a call from BB (who could be tight?), we need to consider. The BB is Kimi-K2? Actually seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (maybe the BB). The BB's name is \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\". We have no recall data about that opponent's raise patterns. Could recall opponent actions for Kimi-K2 (BB) but not needed.\n\nWe can consider raising to isolate. Minimum raise to 8 total (so raise by 4 more). That would be a 4x raise (from 4 to 8). In SB, raising is typical with strong hands, but J\u2660K\u2666 is borderline. Many players raise with KJ, but it's okay. Considering we are out of position, raising isolates and can take the pot preflop. But also risk of being 3-bet and out of position. However, the BB is unknown. The other player (MiniMax-M2) just called, which indicates they have a wide range. So raising could be good to isolate and potentially take down the pot preflop or go heads-up with BB.\n\nStack depth: 39.5 BB, raising to 8 is ~2 BB, small raise. Could also just call and see flop out of position. But we have J\u2660K\u2666, good for post-flop play, but out of position SB vs BB and MP. Might want to raise to thin the field.\n\nPot odds: If we call, we invest 2 chips, pot becomes 12. If we raise to 8, we invest 8 total (i.e., additional 6 chips). The pot would be 10+2 (call) +6 raise? Actually after raise, the pot would be 10 (original) + 2 (SB call) + 4 (BB) + 4 (MP call) + (raise to 8 total from SB, meaning SB adds 6 more) = 24? Let's compute: initial pot 10 (SB 2 + BB 4). MP calls 4, so pot 14. SB call 2 to match 4, pot 16. If SB raises to 8, they add 4 more (since they already called 2? Actually they need to put total 8, so they add 6 more). So pot becomes 22 (16+6). So raise adds 6 chips. That seems okay.\n\nGiven J\u2660K\u2666 is a decent hand, raising to 8 to isolate is reasonable. Also we have decent stack, can play postflop.\n\nThus action: raise to 8.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So we have gutshot (need K) and also have backdoor flush draw? Suits: board Qs Th 2d, we have Js (spade) and Kd (diamond). So we have a flush draw with spades: board has Qs, we have Js, need another spade. So we have nut flush draw? Actually highest spade on board is Qs, we have Js, so we need Ace or King spade for nut flush, but we have Kd not spade. So we have a nut flush draw? No, we have J spade, board Q spade, so we have two spades, need Ace or King spade for nut flush, but we don't have them, but we could still make a flush (non-nut). So we have a gutshot straight draw and a flush draw (two outs for flush? Actually we have two spades, need any spade (9 spades left? 13 total spades, 2 on board, 1 in hand = 3 spades known, so 10 spades left). So decent draw.\n\nPot is 24 chips. Stack 152. Opponents: Seat1 Kimi-K2 (212 chips) is BB, Seat4 MiniMax-M2 (207 chips) called preflop and is in the hand. So we have two opponents: BB and MP (seat4). Both have called the preflop raise. No flop betting yet, amount to call 0, min raise 4, legal actions fold, check, raise.\n\nWe need to decide whether to bet (raise) or check. Consider opponent tendencies: we have no data from recall. Could attempt to recall previous actions of Kimi-K2 and MiniMax-M2 on flop. The recall returned none. So we have no history. Could assume typical.\n\nOur hand is a strong draw with potential to make top pair? Actually we have no pair currently. Board Q T 2, we have J, K, so we have gutshot to straight, flush draw, also have overcards (K and J). Could be a decent semi-bluff. Pot is 24, we have 152 left, so can bet around pot size to apply pressure. Raising to maybe 20-30 chips. Minimum raise is 4, but we could raise to 20 (which is total). That would be ~0.8 pot.\n\nConsider tournament stage: we have 38 BB, medium stack. Should preserve chips but also build. A semi-bluff could win pot now or set up future.\n\nCheck could allow free cards, but we risk giving free check-raise? Not likely.\n\nThus I think raise to maybe 20 chips (total). Reason: we have strong draws, want to put pressure, also protect against opponent making pair. Also we have decent stack to risk.\n\nThus action: raise to 20.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

Actually with J we have J gives us straight: Ten-J-Q-K-A? Wait we have K and J, board: Q T 2 5. So we have K-J, board Q T, that gives us a straight draw: need A or 9 for straight? Let's see: possible straights: 9-T-J-Q-K (need 9) or T-J-Q-K-A (need A). So two outs for straight (9 and A). Also we have backdoor flush? Board has two spades (Qs,5s) and we have Js (spade). So we have three spades, need one more spade on river for flush. So we have open-ended? Actually we have 3 spades, need one more for flush (9 outs approx). So total outs: 2 straight outs + 9 flush outs (but some overlap: the 9 of spades is both straight and flush? 9 spade counts both, also A spade counts both? A spade also straight? A spade would give A-high straight (T-J-Q-K-A) plus flush. So overlapping reduces total outs a bit. Rough estimate ~13 outs.\n\nPot is 84, we are facing amount to call 0 (we are first to act on turn). Actually actions: after flop betting, everyone called. Turn now: we have option to check or raise. Opponent(s): Seat1 Kimi-K2 (SB? Actually seat1 is BB?), seat4 MiniMax-M2. Both have called flop bet. We are SB, seat5. So we have two opponents.\n\nWe have 132 chips stack, pot 84, effective stack maybe 132 (our stack) vs opponents maybe similar.\n\nWe have decent draw with decent pot odds. Turn bet size? We can bet to build pot or to protect. With 13 outs, need about 13/47\u224827% chance to hit on river. Pot odds if we bet and get called? If we bet X and they call, we get pot+X+call. But we could also check and hope to see river cheap.\n\nGiven we have a draw, it's often good to bet to charge draws and get value if they have made hand. Opponents: Kimi-K2 previously bet 20 on flop, seems aggressive. MiniMax-M2 called. Could have made pair Q, T, or straight draws.\n\nOur hand currently is a gutshot? Actually we have two pair? No, we have J K, board Q T 2 5. No pair. So we are drawing.\n\nWe could bet around half pot (maybe 40-50) to get value and protect. But we must consider stack sizes: we have 132, pot 84, betting 40 leaves us 92 left. Opponents could call.\n\nCheck is also possible to see river cheap, but gives free card.\n\nGiven tournament, we have decent stack (33 BB). We can afford to be aggressive.\n\nThus I think raise (bet) to maybe 50 chips (total bet amount). Minimum raise is 20 (since previous bet? Actually no previous bet on turn, amount to call 0, min raise to 20). So we can raise to 50.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 bet on flop 20 (small). Might be medium strength. MiniMax-M2 called, maybe also medium.\n\nThus a bet of 50 could extract value from hands like Qx, Tx, maybe pair.\n\nI'll decide to raise to 50.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

Actually board: Q T 2 5 K. Our hand: J K. So we have pair of Kings, plus we have a straight? Let's see: Q-J-10? We have J, board has Q and T, that's a gutshot to straight (J would give J-Q-T-9-8? No). Straight possibilities: 9-8-7-6? No. So only pair.\n\nBoard: Qs Th 2d 5s Kh. Possible hands opponent could have: they could have a set? No board pairs. Could have two pair: QK? They could have QK (but we have Kd, they could have Qx). Could have straight: A-9? Not. Could have flush? Board has two spades: Qs, Ts, 5s. So three spades? Actually Qs, Ts, 5s are spades, that's three spades. Opponent could have two spades for flush, but we have Js (spade) and Kd. So we have one spade, opponent could have two spades for flush. Potential flush draws: they could have As? Actually need two spades: any two spades. So they could have A\u26609\u2660 etc.\n\nOur opponent: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4). Their actions: preflop they called 4 (small blind?), they called our raise preflop. Then flop they called 20 (we bet 20). Turn we bet 50, they called. River: amount to call 0, we can check or raise. So they have shown willingness to call bets on flop and turn. We bet 20 on flop, they called. Turn we bet 50 (which is 50 into pot? pot after turn: preflop pot? Let's compute: preflop: we raised to 8, others called 4 each. So pot after preflop: 2 (SB) +4 (BB) +4 (call) +8 (our raise) +4 (call) = 22? Wait details: SB 2, BB 4, we raise to 8 (so we add 8? Actually raise from 4 to 8, we put 8 total). Then seat1 call 4, seat4 call 4. So total contributions: SB 2, BB 4 (but we raised to 8, meaning we added 4 more?), Actually raise to 8 means we put total 8 chips. So contributions: SB 2, BB 8, seat1 4, seat4 4 = 18. But pot shown is 184 at river, so many bets later.\n\nFlop bet 20 each, pot becomes 18+20+20+20 = 78? Actually we bet 20, they each called 20, so add 60, pot 78.\n\nTurn bet 50 each, we bet 50, they called 50, add 100, pot 178. River amount to call 0, pot 184 (so maybe some rounding). So we have pot 184.\n\nNow we need to decide to check or raise. Opponent's stack: they have 137 chips total, after calling 50 on turn they have 137-? They started with 137, posted small blind? Actually seat4 is not blind, seat5 is BB. Seat4 called 4 preflop (so they put 4). Flop called 20, turn called 50. So total they've invested: 4+20+50 = 74. Their remaining stack = 137 - 74 = 63 chips. So they have 63 chips left.\n\nWe have 82 chips, we posted 2 sb? Actually we are BB, posted 4, raised to 8 (so extra 4). So our total invested: 8 preflop, 20 flop, 50 turn = 78. Our remaining stack = 82-78 = 4 chips left (including any remaining? Actually we have 4 chips left, which is less than the opponent's stack. So we are short-stacked relative to opponent but not all-in yet. However we cannot raise more than our remaining stack? We can go all-in for 4 chips. Minimum raise is 50 (the amount we bet on turn?), but we only have 4 chips left, so we cannot raise the minimum, so we can only check or go all-in? The rules: If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in. So we could go all-in for 4 chips (which is less than min raise). That's allowed.\n\nThus options: check"

So raising all-in is not good; we would lose 4 chips more. Better to check and hope they check, but they have 63 left and could also bet. However we cannot raise more than 4, but we could check and let them bet. If they bet, we could fold or call? But we cannot call because we have only 4 chips, they could bet more than 4, we would be forced to go all-in anyway.

Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide preflop action. Evaluate hand strength: A9 suited is decent but not premium. In BTN position, can open raise. However there are two players left: SB (2 chips) and BB (4 chips). Both are short stacks (SB 180 chips, BB 242). Actually SB has 180, BB 242. So both have decent stacks relative to blinds (45 BB and 60 BB). They could shove or call.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, Kimi-K2 (seat 2) is the BB. Past raises amounts: many raises of 6 (i.e., 2x BB?), 12, 32, 16. So they sometimes raise bigger. They may be aggressive. Seat 1 is SB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) with 180 chips. No recall for SB.\n\nGiven we have A9s, typical strategy: open raise to about 2.5-3 BB (i.e., 10-12). Minimum raise is 8 (i.e., 2 BB). Could raise to 10 or 12. Since we have decent stack, we can raise to 12 (3 BB) to build pot and isolate. Opponents may 3-bet or call. Since they have short stacks relative to effective stacks? Actually we have 260, they have 180/242, similar. So we can raise.\n\nConsider tournament stage: unknown, but stack sizes moderate.\n\nThus likely raise to 12. Reason: standard open raise from BTN with A9s, building pot, leveraging position, also can fold if they 3-bet.\n\nThus answer: raise to 12.\n\nCheck legal: minimum raise to 8, we can raise to 12.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So now we are in BB with no raise, amount to call 0. So we can check or raise. Hand 5h6d is a suited connector, decent for deep stack but not premium. In early position (BB) but only 65 BB deep, still can play speculative hands. However there is a single opponent in SB with 120 chips (approx 30 BB). Their stack is shorter, but they just called. So they might be playing a wide range. We could consider raising to isolate. With 5-6 suited, we could raise to maybe 12-14 (3x BB). Minimum raise is 8 (to total 8). So raise to 12? The legal raise to any amount? Usually can raise to any amount >= min raise (8) up to stack. Raising could isolate and get heads up pot with good implied odds. However 5-6 suited is not a premium hand; raising might get a 3-bet from them or they may fold. Since they already called, they likely have a range of maybe 70% of hands? In tournament, we may want to steal BB? Actually we are BB, we can check and see flop cheap. With 5-6 suited we have potential for straights and flushes. With 65 BB we can afford to see flop cheap. Checking is safe.\n\nGiven opponent's stack is 120 (shorter) and they just called, they might be looking to see cheap flop. If we raise, we risk being 3-bet and losing more chips.

Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 7,8,9) not immediate. Also we have open-ended? No. We have a gutshot to a straight with a 7 (makes 5-6-7-8-9 but board has no 8 or 9). Actually we need 7,8,9 to complete. So not strong. Also we have a pair? No. So we have just a weak hand, maybe a backdoor flush? Suits: we have hearts and diamonds, board has hearts? No hearts on board. So no flush draw.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) checked flop. They are short stack 120 chips, we have 262. Pot is 8 chips. No bet. So we can check or raise.\n\nWhat is opponent's tendency? Looking at recall: In hand 32, opponent bet 20 on flop after calling preflop. That suggests they may bet when they have something. In hand 24, they called flop bet 20 after preflop call. In hand 29, they called flop bet 25 after preflop call. In hand 27, they checked flop then called later? Actually they called a bet of 16 on flop after checking earlier. So they sometimes check and then call if bet.\n\nWe have weak hand; raising would be a bluff. Our stack 262, opponent 120, pot 8. Minimum raise to 4 (total). So raising to 4 would be a raise of 4? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in, including call. Since amount to call is 0, raise_to 4 means we bet 4 chips. That's a small bet, about 0.5 BB. Could be a probe.\n\nGiven opponent short stack, they might be willing to call a small bet with any pair or decent hand. Our hand is weak; we might want to check and see turn. Also we have decent stack, can fold if they bet later.\n\nThus best action: check.\n\nReasoning: weak hand, no draw, opponent checked, we don't want to risk chips.\n\nSo output JSON.",

Both have low stacks relative to us (2 and 4 chips). Actually blinds are 2/4, so seat1 posted 2, seat2 posted 4. Our stack 260 chips. So we are huge stack vs them. We have Q5 offsuit. In BTN, can we steal? The SB has 2 chips, which is only 0.5 BB, basically a dead short stack. The BB has 4 chips, 1 BB. Both are extremely short; they likely will be forced to fold any raise that exceeds their stack. If we raise, we can potentially pick up the blinds. However, we must consider that they could shove all-in (since they have short stacks). Minimum raise is 8 (i.e., to 8 total). That would be 4 more than the BB. The SB would have to call 8 (but they only have 2, they'd be all-in for 2). Actually they could go all-in for 2. The BB could also go all-in for 4. So raising to 8 would be a steal, likely they fold (or call all-in for 2/4). But we need to consider tournament: we have a huge stack; we can risk a raise with a weak hand to pick up blinds.\n\nGiven we have 5d Qh, not great but decent for steal. The SB is a short stack; they might be forced to shove if they have any decent hand. But they have only 2 chips, can't raise beyond that. So we can raise to 8, they can call all-in for 2, we would win extra 2 chips if they call. That's fine.\n\nThus best action: raise to 8 (minimum raise) to attempt to steal. Reason: we have huge stack, position, blinds are short, Q5 is not premium but we can take advantage.\n\nLegal actions include raise.\n\nThus output JSON.",

With K5 offsuit, not a strong hand from UTG. Usually fold. But consider opponent tendencies: seat2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising preflop often (raise amounts 12,32,12,16,12). Those are likely re-raises? Actually they are preflop raises from SB (seat2). In this hand seat2 posted SB 2 (small blind). So they may raise from SB. Their raises are fairly large (12-32) relative to 4 BB blinds? Wait blinds 2/4, so 12 is 3 BB. 32 is 8 BB. So they are aggressive. So likely they will raise when they have decent hands. Our K5 is weak.

Our Ace gives us top pair, but opponent (MiniMax-M2) has checked on flop. Pot is 16 chips (preflop pot: blinds 2+4=6, then we raised to 8 (total 8?), let's compute: Preflop actions: SB 2 (seat4), BB 4 (seat5). Then seat4 call 2 (so puts 2 more, total 4). Seat5 raise 8 (so total 8). Seat4 call 4 (so adds 4 more). So total contributions: SB: 2+2=4? Wait SB posted 2, then called 2 more = total 4. BB posted 4, then raised to 8 (so additional 4) = total 8. So pot after preflop = 4+8+4? Actually SB's 4, BB's 8, plus maybe other? Let's compute: SB 4, BB 8, total 12. But the pot shown is 16 chips. Possibly includes the raise amount? Actually after raise to 8, the total pot = SB 4 + BB 8 = 12. But they show pot 16. Maybe there is also an ante? Not likely. Might be a miscalc but okay. Anyway pot 16.\n\nNow flop: Kd 7h Ac. Our hand: As gives us top pair Aces, but also we have a flush draw? No hearts: board has 7h, we have 6h, so we have a flush draw with hearts (two hearts on board? Actually only 7h on board, we have 6h, that's two hearts, need three more hearts for flush, not a draw). So just top pair, weak kicker.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) checked. We can check or bet. Need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, MiniMax-M2 often checks on flop when they have weak hand? Let's examine pattern: In hand 32 flop they bet 20 (big). In hand 33 flop they checked. In hand 34 flop they called (so they called a bet). In hand 32 they bet big on flop. In hand 33 they checked. In hand 34 they called a bet. So mixed.\n\nWe have top pair, but opponent could have Kx, or a straight draw (maybe 9-8? Not on board). Board: Kd 7h Ac. Straight possibilities: 9-8-? No. So opponent could have Kx (maybe KQ, KJ, KT), or Ace with better kicker (like AK, AQ, AJ) but we have Ace, so opponent could have AK (but board Ace, they have Ace, they'd have two Aces? Actually board Ace, they have Ace, they'd have a set? Wait board Ace, they could have Ace also, they'd have two Aces (pair). If they have Ace, they'd also have top pair but maybe better kicker (like AK). That would be ahead of us because they'd have Ace + King kicker, but board Ace, King present, they'd have Ace-K? Actually they'd have Ace and King, board has Ace and King, they'd have two pair? Let's compute: If opponent has AK, board has Ace and King, they'd have two pair: Aces and Kings with kicker? Actually they'd have Aces (pair) and Kings (pair) using both board cards and hole cards. They would have two pair (Aces and Kings). We have Ace pair only (top pair) plus a 6 kicker, so they'd be ahead.\n\nIf opponent has Kx (like K9), they'd have top pair Kings, which is second best.\n\nIf opponent has a set of 7s (7h? Actually board has 7h, they could have 7x for set). That would be strong.\n\nIf opponent has a straight draw (like 9-8?), not possible.\n\nThus our hand is vulnerable.\n\nGiven opponent checked, we could consider betting to protect our hand against draws and get value from weaker hands like Kx, maybe also from Ace with weak kicker? But we have Ace, they could have Ace with lower kicker (like A5) which would be same pair but we have better kicker? Actually board Ace, we have Ace, they have Ace, they'd have two Aces, we have Ace, they have Ace, both have pair Aces; kicker matters: our kicker 6, theirs could be something else. If they have A5, they'd have kicker 5 vs our 6, we are ahead. So we have slight edge.\n\nBut we have a relatively weak hand, and opponent"

Opponent (seat4 MiniMax-M2) has checked flop and turn. Stack sizes: opponent 130 chips, we have 258 chips. Pot 16 chips. Turn just checked by opponent, amount to call 0. Minimum raise to 4. Legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: check or raise. Consider opponent tendencies: from recall we see that MiniMax-M2 checks flop often (5 examples). No raise on turn data. Likely a passive player, maybe checks with weak hands. Could be a trap? They have called preflop raise and checked flop/turn. Preflop they called our raise (they called 4 after we raised to 8 preflop). So they have a hand they think decent but not strong enough to bet. Could be a middle pair, a draw, or a weak Ace like A7, A3, A2, maybe a Kx, etc.\n\nOur hand: top pair Aces, but board also has Kd. There's a possible straight draw? Board: K-7-A-3. No straight possibilities except maybe 5-4 for a straight? Not relevant. Opponent could have K7 for two pair, or K3, or K5, etc. Or they could have 7-3 for two pair. Or they could have a flush draw? No flush possible (only hearts: 7h, we have 6h, opponent could have heart flush draw? Only two hearts on board, need 3 hearts, not possible). So not flush.\n\nOur top pair is decent but vulnerable to two pair or trips (if they have Kx). Also they could have a set? No set possible (no pair on board). Could have a straight? Not likely.\n\nWe have 258 chips, opponent 130. Raising to 4 (minimum) is a small raise, about 4 chips, pot 16. That's a 25% pot raise, not big. Could be a probe to see if they fold weaker hands, but they already checked. Could also be a value raise to extract more from weaker Aces (like A2, A4). But they might have A7 (two pair) they'd call? They might call small raise.\n\nConsider tournament stage: unknown, but we have decent stack. Opponent is shortish (130). If they have Kx they'd likely call a small raise. If they have weak Ace they'd call as well. If they have nothing, they'd fold.\n\nRaising to 4 is minimal; we could also check and see river. If we check, we give free card. The turn is 3s, board now Kd 7h Ac 3s. River could be any. If we check, opponent could bet river, and we may be forced to call with top pair. Could be okay.\n\nBut we might want to protect against turn giving them free card to improve. But board is not threatening. I think a small raise is good to get value from weaker Aces and maybe fold out draws. However opponent is short stack; they might go all-in if they have strong hand (Kx) but they'd likely call anyway.\n\nRaising to 8 (double pot) could be more value. Minimum raise is 4, but we can raise higher up to stack. However we must ensure we have legal raise amount? The raise_to is total amount we put in. Minimum raise to is 4 (i.e., raise to 4 total). We could raise to, say, 20 (5 BB). But we must consider opponent's stack 130, we could raise to maybe 30 to get more value. But if we raise too much, they might shove all-in and we might be forced to call with only top pair. Might be okay.\n\nGiven we have top pair but not strong kicker, I'd like to keep pot manageable. Raise to maybe 12 (3 BB). Actually 12 > minimum 4, but it's okay. Let's consider pot odds: If we raise to 12, opponent must call 12 to see river. If they have Kx two pair they'd call, but they'd be ahead? Actually Kx gives them two pair (K+7?) Wait board Kd 7h Ac 3s. If opponent has K7, they'd have K7 (two pair K+7). That's ahead of our Aces with 6 kicker. So we would be losing. So raising could lose value to two pair. So we don't want to raise against two pair. But we can't know if they have two pair. If they have K7 they'd likely have called preflop and now check, maybe they'd check turn with two pair hoping to see cheap river. So"

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #39, preflop, we are BB with Th7h (suited hearts). Stack 272, blinds 2/4, we posted small blind? Actually seat 5 post_sb 2, seat 1 post_bb 4. So we are SB? Wait position says BB (Seat 5). But actions: seat5 post_sb 2, seat1 post_bb 4. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But they said Position: BB (Seat5). Possibly they treat seat5 as BB because they are in BB seat? However posted SB 2 suggests they are small blind. Might be a mistake. Regardless, amount to call is 2 (to call BB 4? Actually we posted SB 2, BB posted 4, so to call we need to match BB 4, but they say amount to call: 2, meaning we need to call the BB 4? Wait we posted SB 2, BB 4, amount to call = 2 (difference). So we are in SB, need to call 2 to complete the BB. Minimum raise to 8 (so total bet 8). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have Th7h suited, a decent hand for SB vs one opponent (BB). The opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised preflop in several past hands with amounts 5-12 (relative to blinds 2/4). That suggests they are aggressive, maybe raising 3bb to 4bb? In blind levels 2/4, a raise to 6 is 1.5bb? Actually small blind 2, big blind 4, raise to 6 means 2bb raise (from 4 to 6). Raise to 12 is 8 over big blind (2bb). So they are raising 2-3bb typical. So they are raising preflop from BB position (maybe they are in BB). So they are aggressive.\n\nOur hand Th7h suited is not premium but has decent equity vs a raise (maybe 25-30% vs typical range). In SB with 68 BB, we can consider 3-bet for value or to isolate. But 68 BB is deep; a 3-bet to 8 (total) is only 2bb raise (from 4 to 8) which is small. Actually min raise to 8 total, which is 4 over current 4 (BB). So a 3-bet of 8 is 2bb extra, which is small. That might not be enough to isolate; could just call.\n\nGiven opponent's raise size is maybe 6 (so they raised to 6?). Actually amount to call is 2, meaning BB is 4, they raised to 6? Wait they posted BB 4, but the raise action not shown. The actions list only includes posts and folds. So the raise hasn't been recorded? Actually maybe they are the only other player; they posted BB 4 and then we have to act. So there is no raise; it's just blinds. So amount to call 2 (to call BB). So it's just a blind situation, not a raise. So we just need to decide to call the BB 4 (i.e., complete the bet) or raise. So we are in SB with Th7h, opponent in BB.\n\nGiven that, we can decide to raise to isolate. With 68 BB, we can raise to e.g., 12 (3bb) or 16 (4bb). Minimum raise to 8 is allowed. A raise to 8 (total) is 4 total (i.e., 2bb). That seems small but can be used as a steal. Since we are in SB, we want to steal the BB's blind. Our hand is decent suited, could be good to raise.\n\nBut we must consider opponent's tendencies: they have raised preflop in past (aggressive). As BB, they may defend or re-raise. But we have 68 BB, can handle a 3-bet. Th7h suited is not strong enough for a big 3-bet maybe.\n\nThus a standard play: raise to about 12 (3x BB) to put pressure. But we must follow min raise to 8; we can raise to 12 (total). That is legal.\n\nGiven we have no raise yet, we can raise to 12. Reason: attempt to steal, hand has some equity if called, also isolate.\n\nThus choose action \"raise\", raise_to 12.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop: we have Kc 9s, board Qs 5d 8c. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) in seat 4 bet 11 into pot 33. Our stack 264, we have 66 BB. We are BTN, we called preflop. So flop: we have Kc 9s, board: Qs 5d 8c. Hand combos: we have gutshot straight draw? Let's see: cards: 9,8,? Actually we have 9 and board 8, so we have open-ended straight draw? Need 7 or J for straight: 7-8-9-10-J? Wait we have 9, board 8, Q,5. So possible straight draws: 7-8-9-10-J requires 7 and J; 9-10-J-Q-K needs 10 and J; we have K, so need J and 10 for straight K-Q-J-10-9? Actually K-Q-J-10-9 is a straight, we have K, need J and 10. Also we have gutshot to a straight with 7? 7-8-9-10-J? Not with K. So we have two overcards (K) and a gutshot? Actually we have a gutshot to a straight: need J for 9-10-J-Q-K? No need 10 and J. So not a gutshot; we need both 10 and J. So currently we have only one pair? No pair. So we have overcards: K is top pair potential, 9 is middle.\n\nBoard: Qs 5d 8c. Opponent bet 11 (about 1/3 pot). Pot 33, bet 11, we call 11 to see turn, pot would be 55 after call.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has shown some patterns: In hand 32, they bet 20 on flop after raising preflop? Actually hand 32: preflop call 8, flop bet 20 (bigger). Hand 33: flop check, turn bet 4. Hand 34: flop call 8, turn bet 8. Hand 38: flop check, turn check, river check. So they sometimes bet small on flop, sometimes check. They seem to be a relatively passive player, maybe medium strength.\n\nIn this hand, they raised preflop to 8 (small raise) from UTG? Actually seat 4 is probably UTG? Not sure. They raised 8 (2x big blind) which is a limp raise? Could be wide range.\n\nNow flop bet 11 (about 1/3 pot). This could be continuation bet with a wide range, maybe they have Q, 8, 5, or combos. Could also be a bluff with missed overcards.\n\nOur hand Kc 9s has some equity: we have two overcards, a gutshot? Not exactly. We have a backdoor flush draw? We have spade Kc? Actually Kc is clubs, not spade. Board has Qs, so we have no spade. So no flush draw.\n\nOur equity vs opponent's range: If opponent has Qx (like QJ, QT, Q9 etc.) they'd have top pair, we have K kicker maybe second best. If they have 8x they'd have middle pair, we have K kicker. If they have 5x they'd have bottom pair. If they have combos like J10 (draw) we have some equity.\n\nGiven small bet, we could call to see turn, as we have decent equity and stack deep.\n\nWe need to consider tournament: we have 66 BB, comfortable.\n\nThus call seems appropriate.\n\nCheck if raising is possible: minimum raise to 22 (i.e., raise additional 11). Raising would be to 22 total. That would be a 2x raise. Could be a semi-bluff? Not much.\n\nBetter to call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Board: Q-5-8-6. Our 9 gives us a gutshot straight draw: 7 would complete 5-6-7-8-9? Wait we have 9, board has 8,6,5, Q. Straight possibilities: 9-8-7-6-5 would need 7. So we have gutshot to 9-high straight (needs 7). Also we have backdoor flush? We have Kc 9s, board has clubs? Qs is spade, 5d diamond, 8c club, 6s spade. We have one club (9s is spade). So not flush draw. We have top pair? No Q on board, we have K, not pair. So we have only gutshot.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) checked the turn after betting flop 11 (we called). So they checked. That could indicate weak or pot control.\n\nPot currently 44 chips. Opponent checked, we have option to check or raise. Minimum raise to 11, meaning raise to 11? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 11 would be a bet of 11 (since min raise = 11). So raise to 11 (i.e., bet 11). Could also raise more.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: opponent stack unknown? Not given but earlier they had 111 chips preflop. They have not bet much, so likely still near 111. Our stack 253. So we have big stack relative.\n\nOpponent tendencies from recall: Past actions show they sometimes bet small on turn (4,8). They also check sometimes. Not clear. They seem to be a passive player who checks often, but also bets small when they have something.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely we should check and fold to river bet. Since we have only a gutshot and no pair, it's not worth betting. Also we have position (BTN) but opponent is in SB? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, they were SB? Preflop: seat1 post_sb 2, seat2 post_bb 4, seat3 fold, seat4 raise 8 (so seat4 is UTG? Actually seat numbers: seat1 is SB, seat2 BB, seat3 maybe UTG, seat4 is maybe cutoff? Wait table: seat1 SB, seat2 BB, seat3 maybe UTG, seat4 maybe MP? But not important. They are the only other player left, they are acting first (they checked). So we are last to act.\n\nGiven the board, they may have Qx, 8x, 6x, 5x. They could have a queen, a pair, a straight draw, etc. Checking could be a trap or weak.\n\nBetting 11 into 44 is about 1/4 pot. Could be a probe bet. Raising could be seen as aggression, but we have weak hand. Might be okay to check and see river.\n\nThus choose check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. Folding not applicable because no bet.

We have 9, board 8,6,5, Q, A. Not a straight. Could have gutshot? No. No flush (two spades: 9s, 6s, plus board has spades? Qs and 6s are spades, we have 9s, that's three spades, need five). So we have K high, maybe Ace high? Board has Ace, we have K, so we have K kicker. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) checked river after checking turn. Preflop they raised to 8, we called. Flop they bet 11, we called. Turn check both. River check both. Pot 44. So opponent's range? Preflop raise from UTG? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, we are BTN, they raised 8 from early? Not sure position: seat 4 is likely UTG? Table seats: seat1 SB, seat2 BB, seat3 maybe UTG? Actually seat numbers: seat1 SB, seat2 BB, seat3 maybe UTG? seat4 maybe MP? Anyway they raised preflop and called flop bet. Their line: raise preflop, bet flop, check turn, check river. That suggests maybe they have a hand like middle pair, overpair, top pair, maybe a draw that missed. Board: Q A 8 6 5. They could have Qx, Ax, 8x, 6x, 5x. They bet flop 11 into pot? Preflop pot: 8+8+2+4 = 22? Actually preflop: they raised 8, we called 8, plus sb 2 and bb 4 = total 22. Flop pot 22, they bet 11, we called, pot now 44. Turn check both, pot stays 44. River check both, pot 44. So checking suggests they have a hand not strong enough to bet. Could be a weak pair, a draw, or a hand like K9? Our K9 is not strong. Opponent could have QJ, Q9, Q8, Q7, Q6, Q5, Q4, Q3, Q2, maybe A? But they have Ace on board, they could have A? But they'd likely bet. Could be a missed straight draw like 7-9? Actually 7-9 would have straight 5-6-7-8-9, but board is 5-8-6-A-Q, 7-9 would make straight? Let's see: board 5,6,8, Q, A. With 7 and 9 you have 5-6-7-8-9 = straight, but board missing 7. So you need 7 and 9. Opponent could have 7-9, they'd have a straight on river? But they didn't bet, so unlikely.\n\nOur hand Kc9s: we have K high, no pair. So we are likely behind any pair or better. Could we bluff? River check from opponent suggests they are weak. Could we bet to steal? But legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 11. Pot 44, so raise to 11 would be small, raise to 55? Actually raise to 11 total? Minimum raise is 11, meaning you must raise to at least 11 chips total (i.e., raise by 11?). Usually raise_to is total amount. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 11 would be a bet of 11. That's a small bet (1/4 pot). Could be a bluff.\n\nBut we have Kc9s, not a good showdown value. We could check and hope they check and we win with K high? But opponent likely has something better, maybe Qx or A? Actually board has Ace, so any Ace would be top pair, but they'd likely bet. They checked, maybe they have a weak Ace like A2? But they'd still have top pair Ace, they'd maybe bet. However they could be slow playing? Not likely.\n\nGiven we have no showdown value, best to check and fold if they bet. But we have option to raise as bluff. Is it profitable? Opponent's stack: they have 111 chips left. They have checked river, could be willing to call a small bet if they have K high? They have K? Actually they could have K? Board has K? No, board no K. So they could have Kx, which would be second best (K9 vs K"

Actually J can make straight with Q? Board: A K T, need Q J? Straight possibilities: A K Q J 10? Actually board A K T, we have J J. A K Q J T would be a straight, but we need Q. So we have gutshot to a straight (need Q). Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Suits: board A\u2663? Actually board: Ac Kh Ts (clubs? Ac is clubs, Kh hearts, Ts spades). Our Jd Jc: one club, one diamond. So we have a backdoor flush draw with clubs (need two clubs). Not strong.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 28 into pot 80. So bet is about 35% of pot. He is in the small blind (seat 4). He called preflop raise (we raised to 24, he called 16). So preflop he called a raise of 24 (our raise to 24, he called 16 more). So he has a decent hand to call a 3x raise from BB? Actually raise to 24 is 3x big blind. In BB, raising 24 after SB 4, BB 8: preflop raise to 24 is 3x BB. He called with presumably a hand that can defend. Could be broadway combos, suited connectors, etc.\n\nNow flop bet 28 (35% pot) is a relatively small continuation bet. Could be a wide range: many hands, including Ace, King, Ten, draws, etc. Could also be a check-raise later.\n\nOur hand: JJ is currently middle pair. Against his range, we likely are ahead of many hands (like Kx, Ax? Actually Ace high beats us, but Ace is top pair. He may have Ace, which is ahead. King also ahead. Ten gives us two pair? Actually board includes T, we have J, so we have J-J, board T, we have pair J, not two pair. If he has T, he has top pair with kicker unknown; we are behind. If he has Q, we have gutshot straight draw; Q would be a gutshot but also open-ended? Actually Q would give him open-ended straight draw (K Q J T). He could have Q? He could have QJ (but we have J's). So not.\n\nWe have overpair to board? Actually board is A K T, we have J J, so we have a pair lower than Ace and King. So it's a medium strength hand.\n\nGiven bet size is small, we could consider calling to see turn. But we need to think about stack: we have 229 chips, after raising preflop we have put 24 in, opponent called 16, pot 80 includes blinds? Let's compute: Preflop: SB 4, BB 8, we raise to 24 (so we put 24 total? Actually we posted 8, then raise to 24, so additional 16). So contributions: SB 4, BB 24, other? Actually seat 4 (MiniMax) called 24? Wait action: preflop: Seat 5 raise 24 (our raise). Seat 4 call 16 (since he already posted 8). So total in pot preflop: SB 4 + BB 24 + SB? Actually seat 3 posted SB 4 (but seat 3 is SB? Wait seat 3 posted_sb 4, seat 4 posted_bb 8. So seat 3 is SB, seat 4 is BB? Actually seat numbers: seat 3 post_sb 4, seat 4 post_bb 8. So seat 3 is SB, seat 4 is BB. Then seat 5 (us) raise 24 (so we are BTN?). Actually we are seat 5 BB? The problem says position BB seat 5. So seat 5 is BB. So seat 3 posted SB, seat 4 posted BB? Actually seat 4 is \"MiniMax-M2\". But they posted_bb 8, meaning they are the BB? But we are BB. Something inconsistent. But we accept that seat 5 is BB.\n\nAnyway pot 80 after flop bet. So pot before flop bet: 80. Then opponent bet 28, making pot 108 if called. So calling 28 would be about 25% of pot.\n\nGiven we have 229 stack, calling 28 leaves us 201. So not huge.\n\nWe need to decide fold, call, raise. Raising would be to at least 56 (minimum raise). That would be a large raise, maybe too strong.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: Past actions"

Actually board: A K T 9. Our Jacks give us a pair of Jacks, but also we have an open-ended straight draw? Let's see: A K Q J 10 would be a straight, but we have A K T 9, J gives us J T 9 8 7? Actually J with board gives us potential straight: 9 T J Q K (needs Q). Also A K Q J T (needs Q). So we have gutshot? Let's compute: With J, we have J T 9, need Q for straight (9-10-J-Q-K). Also we have J, T, A, K - need Q for A K Q J T straight. So we have two possible straight draws needing Q. So we have a gutshot (one card) for straight. Also we have overpair to board? Actually board has Ace and King high cards, we have Jacks, which is lower than both. So we are behind any Ace or King. Also there could be a set if opponent has 9 or T. Opponent's range: they called preflop raise from BB. They are MiniMax-M2, stack 103 chips, likely in middle position (Seat 4). Preflop they called raise 24 (so they have about 24+8=32 in pot). Flop board: A K T 9. They bet 28 into pot 108? Actually pot after flop: preflop pot: raise 24 (our raise) + call 16 from them + blinds 4+8 = 52? Wait compute: Preflop: SB 4, BB 8, we raise to 24 (so we put 24, SB 4, BB 8). Then Seat4 (MiniMax) calls 16 (to match 24). So pot after preflop: SB 4, BB 8, our raise 24, their call 16 (but they put 16 extra? Actually they called 16 more to reach 24 total, so they contributed 24 total: 4+8? Wait they posted BB 8, then called 16 more = total 24. So contributions: SB 4, BB 8, us 24, them 24 = 60. Pot 60.\n\nFlop: seat4 bets 28, we call 28. So pot becomes 60+28+28=116? Actually after bet 28 (seat4) and call 28 (us), pot = 60+56=116. The prompt says pot 108 before turn. Slight discrepancy but okay.\n\nNow turn: seat4 checks. So they have a weak hand or drawing.\n\nWe have Jacks, a pair, but board is A K T 9. Potential combos: They could have Ace, King, Ten, 9, or combos making two pair, sets, etc. They checked. Could be a draw (Q, J, 8). But they have no J? Actually they could have QJ for straight? That would be a made straight already? QJ would make K Q J T 9? That's not a straight, need K Q J T 9? Actually sequence: 9-10-J-Q-K is a straight. So QJ gives them straight already. That would be strong; they'd likely bet. So they likely don't have QJ.\n\nWhat about a set? They could have TT or 99. If they had TT, they'd have set of tens, they'd bet. So probably not.\n\nCould be Ace-high (A x) with maybe a gutshot? They might check to see if we bet.\n\nOur hand is decent but vulnerable to any Ace or King. Our stack 201 chips, pot 108. We are out of position (BB). The opponent checked, we can check behind (control pot) or bet (value or bluff). What is our equity? If we check, we let free card. Turn card unknown? Actually turn card already revealed? Turn is currently being acted on; board is Ac Kh Ts 9c, turn just happened? Wait board shows 4 cards: Ac Kh Ts 9c. So turn is 9c. So the turn card is 9c, we are on turn action. The board includes 9c. So we have Jacks, still no pair on board. The opponent checked.\n\nWe could bet for value against weaker hands like lower pairs (T9, 9x, maybe 8-7 draws). Also could bluff to represent Ace/King? But we have no Ace/King.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: Opponent 103 chips, we 201. Pot 108."

          "reasoning_content": "We have Jacks on board Ace King Ten nine. So board: A\u2663 K\u2665 T\u2660 9\u2663. We have pocket Jacks, giving us a pair of Jacks, plus we have a straight draw? Actually board: A K T 9. Our Jacks give us a pair of Jacks, but also we have an open-ended straight draw? Let's see: A K Q J 10 would be a straight, but we have A K T 9, J gives us J T 9 8 7? Actually J with board gives us potential straight: 9 T J Q K (needs Q). Also A K Q J T (needs Q). So we have gutshot? Let's compute: With J, we have J T 9, need Q for straight (9-10-J-Q-K). Also we have J, T, A, K - need Q for A K Q J T straight. So we have two possible straight draws needing Q. So we have a gutshot (one card) for straight. Also we have overpair to board? Actually board has Ace and King high cards, we have Jacks, which is lower than both. So we are behind any Ace or King. Also there could be a set if opponent has 9 or T. Opponent's range: they called preflop raise from BB. They are MiniMax-M2, stack 103 chips, likely in middle position (Seat 4). Preflop they called raise 24 (so they have about 24+8=32 in pot). Flop board: A K T 9. They bet 28 into pot 108? Actually pot after flop: preflop pot: raise 24 (our raise) + call 16 from them + blinds 4+8 = 52? Wait compute: Preflop: SB 4, BB 8, we raise to 24 (so we put 24, SB 4, BB 8). Then Seat4 (MiniMax) calls 16 (to match 24). So pot after preflop: SB 4, BB 8, our raise 24, their call 16 (but they put 16 extra? Actually they called 16 more to reach 24 total, so they contributed 24 total: 4+8? Wait they posted BB 8, then called 16 more = total 24. So contributions: SB 4, BB 8, us 24, them 24 = 60. Pot 60.\n\nFlop: seat4 bets 28, we call 28. So pot becomes 60+28+28=116? Actually after bet 28 (seat4) and call 28 (us), pot = 60+56=116. The prompt says pot 108 before turn. Slight discrepancy but okay.\n\nNow turn: seat4 checks. So they have a weak hand or drawing.\n\nWe have Jacks, a pair, but board is A K T 9. Potential combos: They could have Ace, King, Ten, 9, or combos making two pair, sets, etc. They checked. Could be a draw (Q, J, 8). But they have no J? Actually they could have QJ for straight? That would be a made straight already? QJ would make K Q J T 9? That's not a straight, need K Q J T 9? Actually sequence: 9-10-J-Q-K is a straight. So QJ gives them straight already. That would be strong; they'd likely bet. So they likely don't have QJ.\n\nWhat about a set? They could have TT or 99. If they had TT, they'd have set of tens, they'd bet. So probably not.\n\nCould be Ace-high (A x) with maybe a gutshot? They might check to see if we bet.\n\nOur hand is decent but vulnerable to any Ace or King. Our stack 201 chips, pot 108. We are out of position (BB). The opponent checked, we can check behind (control pot) or bet (value or bluff). What is our equity? If we check, we let free card. Turn card unknown? Actually turn card already revealed? Turn is currently being acted on; board is Ac Kh Ts 9c, turn just happened? Wait board shows 4 cards: Ac Kh Ts 9c. So turn is 9c. So the turn card is 9c, we are on turn action. The board includes 9c. So we have Jacks, still no pair on board. The opponent checked.\n\nWe could bet for value against weaker hands like lower pairs (T9, 9x, maybe 8-7 draws). Also could bluff to represent Ace/King? But we have no Ace/King.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: Opponent 103 chips, we 201. Pot 108.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop with Td9c in BB facing a raise to 16 (so 8 to call, min raise to 24). Opponent seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised. We have data: Past raises amounts: 4,4,8. Showdowns: hand 24 they had Tc9s (they had T9 suited, same rank but suited hearts? Actually they had Tc9s). That hand they made a showdown with community Qs Th 2d 5s Kh - they had pair tens? Actually they had Tc9s, board includes Th, so they had top pair tens, maybe lost? Not sure outcome. Hand 40 they had KsJc and board Qs5d8c6sAh \u2013 they missed. Hand 42 they had Kc8h board AcKhTs9c3d \u2013 they had pair kings? Actually board includes Ac Kh Ts 9c 3d, they have Kc, so they have pair of kings, maybe win.\n\nSo opponent seems to raise small amounts preflop (4-8) from SB? Actually seat 4 is presumably UTG? But they are raising from early position? Not sure.\n\nOur stack 193, blinds 4/8, we are BB with 24 BB. Our hand Td9c unsuited, decent connectors, but not premium. In BB vs raise 16 (2x BB) from seat 4, we can consider call or raise (3-bet). 3-bet to 24 min raise (i.e., 24 total). That would be 24 total, meaning we raise to 24 chips (i.e., 16 more). That is a small 3-bet, about 3x raise (since raise to 24 from 16). Actually raise amount is 24 total, which is 8 more than call? Wait: amount to call is 8, min raise to 24 means total bet of 24, which is a raise of 16 over call. So 3-bet to 24, that's 3x the original raise (original raise 16). That's a decent size.\n\nWe need to consider opponent's tendencies: they raise small, maybe wide range. Our hand is suited? No, unsuited. So maybe call and see flop? But we are out of position (post-flop we will be out of position). With 24 BB stack, we want to preserve chips. T9 unsuited is a marginal hand. I'd likely fold to a raise from early position, especially out of position with 24 BB. However 8 to call is not huge relative to stack; but we risk playing out of position.\n\nGiven opponent's raise size is small, they might be raising with wide range, but also could be stealing. Our hand has some potential for straight draws. Could call and see flop for cheap. But if they are aggressive, they may continuation bet.\n\nI think best is to call (8) to see flop, preserving stack, and we have implied odds. But we have 24 BB, call 8 = 8 chips, leaving 185. That's fine.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand: Td9c, board Qh 2c 8d. In BB, we called preflop raise from seat4 (MiniMax-M2) who raised to 16 (post blind). So pot 48 after flop bet of 16 from MiniMax. We have T9 unsuited. Board Q 2 8. Our hand currently has gutshot straight draw? Actually we have T9, board Q 8 2. Straight possibilities: 7-6-5-4? Not. With T9 we have open-ended? 9-10, need J and K for straight (9-10-J-Q-K) open-ended? Actually we have 9-10, board has Q, so need J and K for straight. That's two outs (J and K). Also we have backdoor flush? we have 9c, board has 2c, so one club on board, we have club, need two more clubs on turn and river for flush (backdoor). Also we have pair? No pair. So fairly weak.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 16 into pot 48, so about 1/3 pot. Could be continuation bet with many hands, including strong Qx, overpairs, draws. Our stack 185, opponent stack 179. We have 185, after call 16 we will have 169 left. The pot after call will be 48+16+16=80. So pot odds: need to call 16 to win 80 => 16/80 = 20% required. Our chance to improve? We need to hit straight (J or K) or maybe flush backdoor (low chance). Probability of hitting straight on turn or river: we have 2 outs (J, K) = 4 cards (two each? Actually each rank 4 suits, we have none of them, so 8 outs? Wait J and K each 4 suits = 8 outs). But some may be dead? Unknown. So approx 8 outs. Turn: 8/46 \u2248 17.4%; if miss turn, river: (38/45)*8/45? Actually compute chance to hit by river: 1 - (38/46)*(37/45) = about 1 - (0.8261*0.8222)=1 -0.679=0.321 => 32% chance to hit straight by river. Plus backdoor flush: we have one club, need two more clubs. There are 13 clubs total, we have 1, board has 1, so remaining clubs = 11. Turn: 11/46 \u2248 23.9%, then need another club on river: 10/45 \u224822.2% => combined probability about 5%? Actually probability of both clubs: (11/46)*(10/45)=110/2070=5.31%. So total improvement chance approx 32%+5% \u224837% to make strong hand (straight or flush). Also could pair 9 or T on turn/river: 3 outs each? Actually there are 3 remaining 9s and 3 remaining Ts = 6 outs. Probability to pair by river: 1 - (44/46)*(43/45) \u2248 1 - (0.9565*0.9556)=1 -0.913=0.087 => 8.7% chance to pair. So total chance to improve to at least pair: about 46% maybe.\n\nBut current hand is weak, likely behind many of opponent's range. Should we fold? Considering pot odds 20% and chance to improve maybe 46% but many of those improvements may still be behind opponent's strong Qx or pair. Straight will beat many, flush maybe. But still maybe marginal.\n\nOpponent's betting pattern: preflop raise to 16 (3x BB). Likely a standard raise range includes broadway, pairs, suited connectors. On flop Q-2-8, they continuation bet 16 (1/3 pot). Could be many hands, including Qx, 8x, 2x, overpairs, draws. Our T9 is a decent draw with open-ended straight draw? Actually it's a gutshot? Wait we need J and K for straight, that's 2 ranks, 8 outs. That's decent. So we have a decent draw. Could consider calling.\n\nRaising? Minimum raise is 32, raising to 32 would be a pot raise? That would be 16 more. Not advisable with weak hand.\n\nThus best action: call.\n\nLet's provide reasoning.",

Hand: T9 unsuited, board Q 2 8, we have gutshot to straight (J gives 9TJQK? Actually need J for straight 8-9-10-J-Q? Wait board: Q 2 8, we have T9, so we have open-ended? Let's see possible straights: 8-9-10-J-Q is a straight, we have 9 and T, need J. Also 9-10-J-Q-K also straight, need J or K? Actually with Q, we could have 10-J-Q-K-A? No. So only gutshot needing J. Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Suits: we have Td (diamonds) and 9c, board hearts, clubs, diamonds. One diamond on board (8d), we have Td, so we have a flush draw? Need two more diamonds, only one on board, so not immediate. So hand is weak but has gutshot and some overcards. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 16 into pot 48, pot after bet 48+16=64? Actually pot before bet 48, opponent bets 16, so pot now 64. Our call 16 gives us pot odds: 16/(64+16)=16/80=0.2 => 20% required. Gutshot approx 4 outs (J) plus maybe two overcards for pair? Actually we have overcards T and 9, board Q 2 8, we could pair T or 9 on turn/river. That's 2 outs each? Actually each has 3 remaining, total 6 outs for pairing. Plus gutshot 4 outs (J). Some overlap? J not same rank as T or 9. So total outs ~10. Approx 10/47 ~21% chance to improve by river, but need turn+river? Actually we need one card to improve now? Straight on turn or river, also pair on turn, etc. So probability of hitting something by river maybe 30-35%? Pot odds 20% okay. Also stack depth 185, opponent likely medium stack. Could consider raise? Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise additional 16). Raising would be 32 total, we would be putting 32 more chips. Would we be good? Likely not; we have marginal hand. Better to call and see turn. So call.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

However a raise could be seen as a bluff; but we have no fold equity maybe low. Let's consider: If we raise to minimum 16, we put total 16 more, making pot 80. If opponent calls, we lose 16 more with no showdown value. If opponent folds, we win 64. What is probability they fold? Unknown. Opponent's prior aggression: they raised preflop, bet flop, then checked turn and river. That suggests they may have a medium hand like Qx or 8x that they were comfortable betting flop but then checked when board didn't improve. Could be they have Q8, Q2, Q3, Q6, etc. Might also have a pair of 8s, but board has 8d, they might have 8c? Not on board. Could be they have a straight draw? Not likely. They might have a hand like QJ for top pair, but they'd probably bet on turn. So they likely have a weak hand or missed draw; they might fold to raise. But risk is moderate.\n\nGiven tournament considerations, we have 21 BB, still decent. I think checking is safer. So action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

The raise is within stack size and gives us a chance to take the initiative.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 6h7h, small blind posted 4, big blind posted 8. So we are BB, we already posted 8. The small blind (Seat1) posted 4. So amount to call is 4 (to match small blind). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total bet 16). Stack 165. Need decide.\n\n6h7h suited is a decent speculative hand, especially in BB vs SB with 4 chips (small). In tournament with 20 BB stack, we can consider limping or raising. Usually with suited connectors, we can raise to isolate or limp. But SB is likely a short stack? Actually SB has 158 chips, similar stack. Could be a raise from SB? But SB only posted 4, no raise yet. So we can either call (i.e., just check to see flop) or raise. Raising to 16 would be 8 more (since we already have 8 in pot). That's a 2x raise over big blind, standard. 6h7h is a good hand to see a cheap flop; we can also call and see flop cheap. But we are out of position post-flop (SB is left of us). Actually after SB and BB, action goes to SB first preflop, then BB (us) if we call. So if we just call, we will be out of position on flop (SB acts first). Raising can potentially isolate and gain position (since SB would act after us preflop? Actually after raise, SB would act first post-flop still, because they are still left of BB. But they will have to act first preflop; if they fold, we get heads-up with later positions. So raising could isolate.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking (SB) has raised preflop amounts of 5,6,12 etc. So they are willing to raise. But in this hand they just posted blind, not yet acted. Could raise later.\n\nGiven we have 6h7h, a raise is okay to try to steal or get action. But we are out of position anyway; raising may commit chips. However 6h7h has good implied odds, and stack 165. A raise to 16 is not huge. Could also just call and see flop cheap.\n\nPot odds: If we call 4, pot will be 12+4+4=20? Actually pot currently 12 (blinds). If we call, pot becomes 12+4+4 = 20? Wait small blind 4, big blind 8 = 12. If we call 4, we add 4, making total pot 12+4=16? Actually the small blind is already in pot, big blind also. The pot is 12 (4+8). If we call, we add 4, making pot 16. So we invest 4 for chance to win 16, 4x pot odds.\n\nGiven suited connectors, okay.\n\nI think raising is more aggressive and can isolate and maybe win preflop if SB folds. If they call, we still have position disadvantage but can still play.\n\nConsidering tournament stack 20 BB, we can afford a raise. I will raise to 16.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

Actually raise to 16 total). Then Seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) re-raised to 48. So amount to call is 48-16 = 32. Minimum raise to 80 (so raise total would be 80). We have stack 153, can raise.\n\nWe need to consider hand strength: 6h7h suited, decent suited connector, but not premium. In BB vs a raise from UTG? Position: seat1 is UTG? Actually seat1 is under the gun? Not sure but seat1 is the other player left of BB (they posted BB). So they are in SB? Wait: seat5 is BB, seat1 posted SB 4 earlier (post_sb 4). Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 posted SB 4? The actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4 (so seat5 posted small blind? Wait seat5 is our seat, but they posted SB 4, meaning we are in SB? But description says Position: BB (Seat5). But actions show seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. However the problem statement says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". Might be swapped. Let's trust the description: we are BB, we posted 8? But action shows seat5 post_sb 4. Something inconsistent. However we see we raised to 16 (so we opened raise from BB? Actually if we are BB, after posting 8, we can raise. So raising to 16 is a raise of 8 more? That matches typical raise to 16 from BB. Then seat1 (who posted SB 4?) raised to 48. So they are the opponent.\n\nThus we are facing a 3-bet (re-raise) from opponent with 6h7h. Stack 153, effective stack after their 48 bet is 153-16? Actually we have 153 total, we have already put 8 (big blind) then raised to 16 (so additional 8). So we have 153-16 = 137 left. To call 32 more, leaving us 105. Minimum raise to 80 total (so raise additional 64). That would be a 5-bet? Actually raise to 80 total, which is 80 - 48 = 32 raise amount (plus call?). Wait raise to 80 means total contribution after raise is 80, meaning we would put 80 total, which is 80-16=64 more chips. That seems large.\n\nGiven hand is marginal, likely fold. Opponent may be strong. Our stack 19 BB, need to preserve. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total 16). Our stack is 153, so we could raise bigger, maybe to 48 or more. However, we need to consider opponent's tendencies: they have raised 48 previously, which is a big raise (maybe they are aggressive). But we have a strong hand; we should raise to protect against being called by many players. Only SB and BB remain (two opponents). Both have decent stacks: 178 and 218. They may call or re-raise. We could raise to maybe 48 (like they did before) to isolate and get value. But we also have short stack relative to blinds? 19 BB is not extremely short; can still raise.\n\nWe need to ensure we are not overcommitting if they re-raise all-in.

          "reasoning_content": "We have flop: Ks Kh vs board T\u2660 2\u2660 2\u2665. We have top set of Kings. Opponent (BB) checked. Pot 100, we have 105 stack, we are short stacked (13 BB). We have a very strong hand, but we need to consider opponent's range and potential draws. Board is paired low, possible full house draws (e.g., 2x, T's). Opponent could have T2 combos, 2x, maybe a straight draw? No straight possible (board T 2 2). So only possible threats are full house (2s) or maybe a set of Tens (but they would have to have T2? Actually set of Tens requires TT, but board has T\u2660 only one ten, need another ten in hand, possible TT). Also could have a full house with T2 (e.g., T2 gives full house Tens over Twos? Actually board: T 2 2, hand T2 gives two pair (T and 2) not full house. Full house would be TT2 or 222T etc. So opponent could have a set of Twos (2x) giving full house Twos over Tens (2 2 2 T T?). Wait board has two twos, need third two for set, plus a ten for full house? Actually full house is three of a kind plus a pair. If opponent has 2x (third two) and also a ten, they'd have full house twos over tens (222 TT). That's possible only with hand 2T. Also could have TT (pair of tens) making set of tens (TT) with board T gives three tens, plus board has two twos, so they'd have full house tens over twos (TTT 22). So opponent could have TT, 2T, or maybe 2x with no ten (just set of twos) which would be just three of a kind twos, which loses to our set of kings. So we have best possible hand except opponent could have full house (TT or 2T). Those are combos: TT (3 combos) but one ten is on board, remaining tens: hearts, clubs, diamonds (3). 2T combos: need a two (there are two twos on board, remaining two: spades and clubs? Actually board has 2\u2660 and 2\u2665, so remaining twos: 2\u2666 and 2\u2663 = 2 combos) and a ten (remaining tens: hearts, clubs, diamonds = 3). So combos = 2*3 =6 combos. So total full house combos = 9 combos. Also opponent could have a straight draw? No.\n\nThus we have a strong hand, but opponent may have a full house. Should we bet? Yes, we should bet for value. But we have short stack; we can go all-in (105). Minimum raise is 40, raising to 105 is all-in. Pot is 100, we can raise to 105 (all-in) making pot 205 (if called). That's good value. Opponent may call with full house combos (9 combos) or maybe with a lower pair? But they might call with any pair? With short stack, they might call with any decent hand. But we have to consider that we are short stacked and need chips. So we should raise all-in.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We should raise all-in to 105. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

In a tournament early-ish, with 24 BB, we could raise to 24 (3x big blind) typical. However we are short stack maybe need to be aggressive. Opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 is seat 3, after us? Actually UTG seat5, then seat6? Wait seats: 1-5 are players, seat5 is us. Seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 Kimi-K2, seat3 DeepSeek-V3.2, seat4 MiniMax-M2, seat5 us. So order preflop: after posting SB and BB, action starts with UTG (seat5) first? Actually UTG is seat5, but UTG is after BB? In 5-player table, UTG is first to act preflop (under the gun) meaning left of big blind. So we act first. The amount to call is 8 (big blind). So we can fold, call (8), or raise minimum to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). We have 24 BB, could raise more. Need to decide.\n\nHand Td Jc is decent but not premium. In UTG, raising is standard to isolate. With 24 BB, raising to 24 (3x) is okay. Opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 has raised 6, 16, 20 in past. Those are small raises (maybe 1.5-2.5x). So they may be aggressive but also raise small amounts. MiniMax-M2 unknown.\n\nGiven stack size, we could consider a 3-bet? Actually we are opening, not 3-bet. Should we just call? Not advisable UTG call. Better raise to standard 3x BB = 24. Minimum raise is 16, but we can raise higher. Legal actions allow raise (no limit). So raise to 24.\n\nReasoning: decent hand, need to build pot, isolate, and avoid being called by many players. Also we have decent stack.\n\nThus action: raise to 24.",

So we have three of a kind Jacks (trip Jacks) with a Ten kicker. Actually we have trips Jacks, plus a Ten. The board also has a King, so potential full house? Opponent could have Kx for trips Kings? Actually board has one King, so opponent could have Kx to have pair of Kings with board's King, but board also has two Jacks, so they'd have two pair (Kings and Jacks) if they have a King. They could have a set of Kings if they have K? There's only one King on board, need two more for set. So opponent could have K? Actually they could have K? They have one King on board, they could have another King for pair of Kings (pair), not set. So best they could have is two pair Kings and Jacks, or a straight? Board: J,8,J,K. Ten gives potential straight? 8-9-10-J-Q? No Q missing. So not straight. Could be a flush? Two hearts on board: Jh, Kh, plus 8d. We have Td (diamond) and Jc (club).

Actually SB posted 4, BB posted 8, then raise to 24, call 24, call 16. So total contributions: SB 4, BB 8+16=24, us 24, seat2 24. So pot = 4+24+24+24 = 76? Wait compute: SB 4, BB (seat4) posted 8 then called 16 = total 24, us 24, seat2 24 => sum = 4+24+24+24 = 76. Yes pot 76 after preflop.\n\nFlop: we bet 50, seat2 called 50, seat4 folded.

Opponent could have a set of Jacks? They would need a Jack in hand, but board already has two Jacks, they could have the third Jack (Jc) but we have that. So they can't have set Jacks. They could have a set of Kings if they have a King? But need two Kings in hand, impossible. So opponent could have a straight? With board J,8,J,K, need 9-10? Not possible. Flush? Two hearts on board"

Effective stack: opponent 82 chips, we have 287. Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise to 40 total). Need to decide.\n\nK8 suited is a marginal hand in BB vs short stack raise. Consider opponent's raise size: 24 into 8/4 blinds (3bb). That's a standard open raise from early position? Actually seat 2 is likely UTG? Not sure. But they have 82 chips (10.25 BB). Short stack, likely to shove soon. Raising 24 (3bb) is small; maybe they are trying to steal? Could be a wide range. K8 suited is decent but not premium. Against a short stack, calling may be okay for set mining? Not good.\n\nStack sizes: if we call 16 more (to 24 total), we will be at 271 chips left, opponent at 66 chips (if they call). Pot after call: 36 + 16 = 52 chips. Opponent's effective stack 66 vs us 271. We would be out of position post-flop (they are in UTG, we are BB). K8 suited has some potential for straight/flush draws.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should consider re-raising (3-bet) to isolate. But K8 suited is not strong enough to 3-bet for value; could be a bluff, but short stack may call or shove. Minimum raise to 40, which is 5bb total. That's still relatively small. If we 3-bet to 40, opponent might just call and then go all-in later? Their stack 82, they could shove all-in for 58 more (to 82). That would be a huge risk for us with K8.\n\nBetter perhaps to fold. Evaluate equity: K8s vs unknown range of short stack raise (maybe 20% of hands). K8s equity maybe ~35% vs that range. But calling 16 for pot 36 (pot odds ~ 16/(36+16)=16/52=30.8%). So pot odds are okay. However post-flop disadvantage, and implied odds limited because opponent short stack.\n\nThus folding is likely best.\n\nLet's produce JSON.",

Need to consider opponent tendencies: raise frequencies from earlier data: we saw some raises amounts: MiniMax-M2 raised 16 (likely a limp? Actually raise to 16 is just calling big blind? In preflop, after SB 8, BB 16, then UTG acts; raise to 16 is just calling? Minimum raise is 32, so raise to 16 is not a raise but call? The data may be ambiguous. But we have some opponents raising 24, 32, 48, 168 (big). So they may be willing to raise larger.\n\nGiven short stack, pushing is advisable. JTs is strong enough to push. If we call, we risk being outkicked, and may be forced to fold later. So best is to go all-in (raise_to = 283). Legal actions include raise; we can raise to all-in. Reason: short stack, good hand, maximize fold equity.\n\nThus action: raise to 283.",

BB has 146 chips, seat4 has 173 chips. So we are the biggest stack. Minimum raise is 32 (total). So raise would be to 32 total (i.e., 24 more). That's 2 BB raise. With such a weak hand and short stack relative to blinds, we should probably fold. But consider maybe we could steal? SB vs BB and a caller; we are out of position post-flop. 4h7d is low, no straight/flush potential. So fold.\n\nThus action: fold.",

K7o has very low equity and will likely be dominated, and with a short stack we should preserve chips rather than call or raise.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #67. We're BB with 7h Ks. Preflop: SB (seat3) posted 8, BB posted 16. Then we (seat5) raised to 48 (i.e., 3bb total). Seat1 folded. Seat2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 118 (so re-raise). Then seats 3 and 4 folded. So we face a 3-bet to 118. Amount to call is 70 (since we already have 48 in, need to put total 118, so 70 more). Minimum raise to 188 (i.e., raise at least to 188 total). Stack 235, we have 235 total chips, but we have already posted 16 blind + 48 raise = 64 in pot? Actually we posted 48 includes blind? Usually raise to 48 means total contribution 48, which includes the 16 blind, so extra 32. So current stack after raise: 235 - 48 = 187 left. To call 70 would leave 117. To raise to 188 total (i.e., add 140 more), would require total contribution 188, we have 48 already, need 140 more, but we only have 187 left, so possible. Minimum raise is 188 total, which is less than stack (188 <= 235). So we could raise.\n\nNow evaluate hand: 7h Ks off-suit. Not a premium hand. In BB vs 3-bet from seat2 (Kimi-K2). Need to know opponent tendencies: recall shows Kimi-K2 often folds preflop, sometimes raises 24 (small). In hand 52, 58 raised 24 preflop. In this hand they raise to 118 (large). Their stack? Unknown but they have 178 chips (they are at 178). So they are short-stacked relative to blinds (8/16). 118 raise is about 7.4 BB (since BB is 16). That's a big raise, maybe a 3-bet or a 2-bet? Actually they are in seat2 (UTG? seat order: seat1,2,3,4,5). Seat2 is after seat1 (maybe UTG). They might be opening raise? Wait: SB posted 8, BB posted 16. Then seat5 (BB) raised to 48. That's a raise (3BB). Then seat2 (Kimi) raised to 118. That is a 3-bet (re-raise). So Kimi is 3-betting. Their pattern: they rarely 3-bet large; they usually raise 24 (maybe 1.5 BB). So this large 3-bet suggests strong hand. Could be AA, KK, AK, maybe QQ, maybe JJ. 7Ks is not strong enough to continue. Also our stack is shallow (14.7 BB). Calling would leave us with 117 chips left (approx 7.3 BB). That's still enough for later. But we risk being dominated.\n\nGiven we have K7 offsuit, not great vs 3-bet. We could consider folding. But maybe we could call as a speculative hand? K7 suited would be okay, but off-suit is weak. Also K7 offsuit has some equity vs AK (maybe 30%). But vs typical 3-bet range (AK, AQ, JJ+, maybe 99-66, AQs, etc), K7 offsuit is very weak.\n\nThus folding is advisable.\n\nCheck if any tournament considerations: stack 235 chips, short. Need to preserve chips. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON with action fold, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Pot 48 (includes blinds and our BB). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 8, we posted BB 16, then seat 4 raised to 32 (so raise amount 32 total? Actually raise to 32? Wait: \"preflop: Seat 4 raise 32\". The raise amount is likely total bet of 32, i.e., they raised to 32, which is 16 (SB) + 16 raise? Actually SB posted 8, BB 16. A raise to 32 means they put total 32, so they added 24 more (since they already had 8). But the amount to call is 16 (our BB) to match the raise (they raised to 32, so we need to call 16 more). Minimum raise to 48 (i.e., raise to 48 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide with 6c T d? Actually 6d Tc (six of diamonds, ten of clubs). That's a relatively weak hand, off-suit, not a straight draw preflop. In BB vs SB raise, typical range of SB could be wide but maybe they are raising small (to 32) which is 2x SB, 2x BB? Actually it's 2x BB (16) raise. That's a standard raise size. In tournament with short stacks (13.7 BB), you could consider defending with suited connectors, broadways, etc. 6T offsuit is not great. Likely fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 raises amounts: previously raised 4 (small) maybe early in tournament when blinds were lower? Hand #43 raise amount 16 (maybe bigger). Their raise size varies. No indication they are aggressive or loose. But with 6T offsuit, we should fold.\n\nThus action: fold. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop with Ah Qh on BTN, stack 13.2 BB (211 chips). Blinds 8/16, pot currently 172 (includes blinds and raises). Action: SB posted 8, BB 16, Seat3 (DeepSeek) raised to 48 (so 48 total? Actually raise amount 48 means they put 48 total? Usually raise to 48, meaning they added 32 over BB). Then Seat4 (MiniMax) raised to 100 (re-raise). So we face 100 to call, min raise to 152. Our hand is strong (AQ suited). Our stack 211, we can call 100 leaving 111 chips. That's about 5.5 BB left. That's short stack. We are in BTN, we can consider shoving all-in (raise to 211) or calling. But min raise is 152, which is less than stack. Could raise to 152 (minimum raise) or go all-in 211. Considering opponent tendencies: DeepSeek has raised various amounts, sometimes huge (240). MiniMax raises modestly (max 32). Both have short stacks? Not given. Their stacks: Kimi 154, 174; DeepSeek 216; MiniMax 73. MiniMax is short (73 chips). He raised to 100, which is more than his stack? Wait his stack is 73 chips, but he raised to 100? That seems impossible. Actually maybe stacks displayed before action? The table shows MiniMax-M2 - 73 chips (so his stack after posting blind maybe?). But he raised to 100, meaning he must be going all-in (since 73 < 100). So likely his raise is all-in for 73? But the raise amount shown is 100 maybe includes his blind? He posted small blind? No, seat 4 is MiniMax, position after seat3 (UTG?). Actually seat order: SB seat1, BB seat2, seat3 is UTG, seat4 is next (maybe MP). So seat4 hasn't posted blind. So raise to 100 would be his total bet of 100, which exceeds his stack 73, meaning he must be all-in for 73. But the system may allow raise beyond stack, but actual effective amount is his stack. However, we treat as all-in for 73. So pot currently: SB 8, BB 16, DeepSeek 48, MiniMax 73 (all-in). So pot ~145? But they listed pot 172, maybe includes some extra. Anyway, we face a short stack all-in. Our best move: call (i.e., call 73 effective) or go all-in ourselves. Since we have a strong hand, we can call to try to double up. But calling 100 would overcommit to 111 left, still short stack but okay. If we raise to 152, we would be raising more, but we don't have that much chips left (211). Raising to 152 would leave 59 chips, still short. Might be okay to go all-in to maximize equity.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: we have 13 BB, short stack, need to pick up chips. AQ suited is premium. We should go all-in (raise to 211) to maximize pressure, but we are already short stack; calling may be enough. However, if we raise to 152 (minimum raise) we could be re-raised? No more players left. So we could just call. But raising all-in may be seen as aggressive but okay.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Raise_to must be total amount. Minimum raise is 152, but we could raise to 211 (all-in). That would be a raise, not a call.\n\nGiven short stack and strong hand, I think go all-in (raise to 211). Reasoning: we want to double up, opponents are short (MiniMax all-in). DeepSeek's raise size variable, but likely has strong hand. Still AQ suited dominates many ranges. So go all-in.\n\nThus JSON: action \"raise\", raise_to 211, reasoning.\n\n",

So effective stack after posting 16 is 44 left to act. The pot currently: 136 chips (includes blinds and raise). Action: Seat2 raised to 40 (so they put 40 total? Actually they raised 40 after BB posted 16, so they likely put 40 total? Let's assume they raised to 40, meaning they added 24? Not important). Then Seat4 raise to 80 (so min raise to 120). Amount to call is 64 (to match 80). So to call need 64 chips, but we only have 44 left (since we have 60 total including 16 posted). So we cannot call full amount; we can go all-in for 44 (which is less than amount to call). In such case, we can either fold or go all-in (which is a call for less). Usually you can call all-in for less than amount to call, which is considered a call (but not a raise). However legal actions list only fold, call. So call means call all-in for remaining stack. So we can call (all-in) with KKs. That's a very strong hand. With 3.8 BB, we are short stacked, need to shove. So call all-in is correct.\n\nWe need to output JSON with action \"call\", raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

So pot after call: 79 + 20*2 = 119? Actually pot before flop: 79. Then bet 20 (seat1) + call 20 (seat4) = 40 added, so pot 119. We face bet 20, we can call, raise to at least 40 total (i.e., raise by 20). Need to consider hand strength: Kc Qh is overcards, but board is low, no straight draws yet (5-6-2). Potential draws: 4-3 gives straight, also 7-8? Actually 5-6 need 4-3 or 7-8. Our hand KQ doesn't help. Opponent likely has range: preflop they raised from seat1 after 4-raise from seat4 and our call. Preflop action: Seat4 raised 4 (open raise), we called, seat1 (Kimi) re-raised to 12 (3-bet). Then seat4 and us called. So seat1's 3-bet range likely strong: maybe broadway combos, AK, AQ, AA, KK, maybe suited connectors. Postflop, they bet 20 into pot 79 (about 25% pot) on a low board. Could be continuation bet with many hands. Our KQ has showdown value if opponent has pair lower than K, but we have no pair yet. Potential to improve on turn/river. But calling 20 adds 20 to pot of 119, odds ~20/139 = 14.4% needed. Our equity? With KQ vs unknown range maybe 30%? Might be okay to call. But also consider stack sizes: we have 188, opponent 168, seat4 168. All relatively shallow. Could consider raising to protect? But we have no made hand, raising may be too aggressive.\n\nOpponent seat1 may be aggressive; we could call to see turn.\n\nCheck legal actions: fold, call, raise. I think call.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

They might have K7? But board shows K7 7, they could have K7 for trips, or 77 for set, or Kx for top pair. Likely they have a strong hand. We have nothing. We can check or fold. Check is legal (no bet). We could also raise as a bluff, but with 83 BB, we could attempt steal? But opponent already called preflop, showing some strength. Our hand is terrible, no equity. Better to check and hope they check behind, maybe we can see turn cheap. But if they bet, we can fold. So check.\n\nThus action: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So we have high card 3. Very weak. Opponent (Seat 3 DeepSeek-V3.2) checked both flop and turn, and now on river we have amount to call 0, min raise 2, legal actions: fold, check, raise. Since we have nothing, we should check. Could we attempt a bluff? In tournament, we have 83 BB, but pot is only 5 chips. Raising to 2 would be small but could be a bluff; but opponent may call with any decent hand. Since we have nothing, better to check and fold if they bet later. So action: check. Provide reasoning.\n\nBut we must ensure we have legal action \"check\" as amount to call is 0. So output JSON.\n\n",

Actually we have J high, no pair. Board: 4-4-10-K-? Wait board includes 4h Td 2s Kd 4d. So we have a pair of 4s on board (two 4s). Our hand does not improve; we have a gutshot to a straight? Board: 4-4-10-K-4. No straight possible. Our J doesn't help. So we have nothing, likely a losing hand. Opponent (Seat1) checked both preflop, flop, turn. So they have checked to river. Now river also check? Actually amount to call 0, so they have checked. We can either check or raise. Raising is possible but likely a bluff. Opponent stack 166 chips, pot is 4 chips. Very small pot. Our stack 164. This is a tournament early stage? We have 82 BB. Opponent is Kimi-K2 Thinking, maybe a decent player. Since pot is tiny, a raise would be a bluff, but risk minimal because small pot. However we might want to just check and see showdown, losing anyway. But maybe we could attempt a small raise to steal? But they may call with any pair. They have checked, maybe they have a weak hand. But we have nothing. Might be better to check to avoid losing more chips. Since pot is only 4, raising to 2 (minimum) would risk 2 chips. If they call, we lose 2 anyway. If they fold, we win 4. So EV: probability opponent folds * 4 - probability they call * 2. Need estimate of fold probability. Given they checked all the way, they could be weak (e.g., missed the board). Could be a medium pair like 4x, but they'd have 4s maybe they'd check? With a pair of 4s they'd have a set? Actually board has two 4s, so a set would be three of a kind, they'd have a 4. They might check with a set? Usually they'd bet. So maybe they have a weak hand like a high card, maybe they check. So bluff could work. But also could be a draw? Not possible. So maybe decent chance to fold.\n\nGiven tournament, small risk, could raise to 2 (minimum). Let's consider we have 164 chips, but raising 2 is negligible. Could attempt to steal. I'll raise to 2.\n\nWe need to ensure raise_to is total amount we put in. Currently we have 0 in pot, pot is 4. Minimum raise to 2 means we need to put total 2 chips (i.e., bet 2). So raise_to: 2.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop in SB with Ts8c (Ten of spades, Eight of clubs). Position: SB, after posting small blind 1, big blind posted 2. There is a raise? Actually actions: SB posted 1, BB posted 2, seat 4 (UTG? Actually seat 4 is MP? But they are in middle) called 2 (so they just called BB, not raise). So currently pot = SB 1 + BB 2 + call 2 = 5 chips. Amount to call is 1 (to match BB's 2). Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise total to 4 chips). So we can fold, call 1 (to put total 2 in pot), or raise to at least 4.\n\nWe need to consider hand strength: Ts8c is a suited connector? Actually not suited, it's offsuit (spade and club). So it's a weak hand. In SB, we are out of position post-flop. With 82.5 BB stack, but tournament early stage? Not sure chip counts: Kimi-K2 has 192, DeepSeek folded, MiniMax-M2 244, you have 165. So you are middle stack. Should we play? Ts8c off-suit is generally a fold in early position, especially out of position. However there is a call already from seat 4 (likely MP). The BB is also in the hand (they posted 2). We could call to see flop cheap. But being out of position, and hand is weak, likely fold.\n\nBut we could consider that we are in SB, we have already invested 1 chip, and call is 1 more. So total 2 chips. That's 1 BB effective.

Actually two players with same name maybe two different AI clones? Both Kimi-K2 but different seats. Both have similar stack sizes.\n\nWe need to decide action. Preflop from BTN with K6 offsuit. This is a weak hand, generally fold unless we can steal blinds. The SB is 1 chip, BB 2 chips. We are facing 2 to call (just BB). Minimum raise to 4 (i.e., raise by at least 2). So options: fold, call (call 2), raise to 4 or more.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: recall shows Kimi-K2 (both seats) have raised preflop to 6 in previous hands (hand numbers 6,7,8). That suggests they are aggressive and may raise from early position? But here they are SB and BB, not raising now; they just posted blinds. So they have not raised. They might be willing to defend blinds or call raises. Our hand is not strong; raising may get called by BB and SB who could have decent hands. But we could attempt to steal; however K6 is weak; risk of being called and we are out of position post-flop (but we are BTN, so we will be last to act preflop, but after flop we will be first to act). Actually BTN is last preflop, but after flop we will be first (under the gun). So not great.\n\nStack depth: 165 chips, deep enough. Tournament stage unknown but blinds are 1/2, stacks ~80 BB, deep.\n\nThus best to fold. Or we could call to see flop cheap? But 6K offsuit is not a good hand. Better to preserve stack.\n\nThus action: fold.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

No straight draws: we have 8, board K T 5, we have potential gutshot to 9? Actually 8 could give straight with 6-7-9? Not. So basically just Ace high. Opponent's range: preflop raiser likely strong: could have Kx, QJ, AQ, AK, TT, etc. Callers: seat 4 called raise, likely broad range. Our hand is weak. Likely we should check/fold to any bet. Since legal actions: fold, check, raise. Check is appropriate. But maybe consider raising as bluff? With 79.5 BB stack, pot 18, we could try steal? But board is K T 5, we have no equity.

          "content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: BB has 8s Ac. Board: Kc Td 5h 9d. So we have Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: board Kc Td 5h 9d. Straight possibilities: A-? Actually we have Ace, board includes Ten, Nine, King, Five. Ace gives wheel? Not. We have potential straight draw: 8-9-10-J-Q? No J missing. So we have gutshot: need a Jack to make straight 9-T-J-Q-K? Actually board has K, T, 5, 9. So possible straight with Ace? No. We have a gutshot draw: need a 7 to make 5-6-7-8-9? Not, we have 8, board has 5,9,10,K. 8-9-10-J-Q? Need J. So not.\n\nWe have Ace high, maybe a backdoor flush? Suits: board: Kc (clubs), Td (diamonds), 5h (hearts), 9d (diamonds). Our hand: 8s Ac (spades, clubs). So we have Ace of clubs, giving us a flush draw? There's only one club on board (Kc). Need two more clubs to make flush, but only one more club in hand, so we have 2 clubs total (Kc and Ac). Need 3 more clubs on turn and river, impossible. So no flush draw.\n\nThus our hand is just Ace high, no pair, no draw. Opponent (Seat 3 DeepSeek-V3.2) is the only remaining opponent? Actually seats: Seat 4 MiniMax-M2 also still in hand? Let's see actions: preflop: Seat 4 post_sb 1 (small blind), Seat 5 post_bb 2, Seat 3 raise 6, Seat 4 call 5, Seat 5 call 4. So three players in pot: DeepSeek (Seat 3) raised preflop, MiniMax (Seat 4) called, GPT (Seat5) called. Flop: Seat 4 check, Seat5 check, Seat3 check. Turn: Seat4 check. So after turn check, it's our turn (Seat5). So still three players active: DeepSeek (Seat3) hasn't acted on turn yet? Actually order: On turn, after flop, order is from small blind? Typically action starts with first active player left of button. Seats: 1 and 2 folded, seat3 (DeepSeek) is UTG? Actually seat numbers: 1,2,3,4,5. Seat5 is BB, seat4 is SB, seat3 is UTG. After flop, first to act is seat3 (UTG) then seat4 then seat5. But we see flop actions: seat4 check, seat5 check, seat3 check. That order seems off; maybe they act clockwise starting from seat4 (SB) then seat5 (BB) then seat3 (UTG). So on turn, seat4 check, then it's seat5's turn (us). So DeepSeek hasn't acted on turn yet? Actually seat3 would act after seat5. So we need to decide now.\n\nWe have Ace high, board is fairly coordinated: Kc Td 5h 9d. Potential draws: Straight draws: 8-9-10-J-Q? No J. 7-8-9-10-J? Need 8 and J. We have 8, so need J. So we have open-ended? Actually we have 8 and board 9-10, so we have 8-9-10, need 7 or J for straight. So we have a gutshot (need 7) or open-ended (need J)?? Let's examine: cards: 8,9,10. That's a 8-9-10 sequence. To make a straight, need either 7-8-9-10-J? Wait need 5 cards. With 8,9,10 we need either 6-7 (to make 6-7-8-9-10) or J-Q (to make 8-9-10-J-Q). But board also has K and 5. So not. So we have open-ended? Actually we have 8,9,10, need 7 or J for straight. So open-ended (both sides) but missing two cards? No, need one card either 7 or J. So we have an open-ended straight draw (8-9-10). So we need a 7 or J on river to complete straight. That's 8 outs (four 7s, four Js) but some may be dead: we have Ace of clubs, 8 of spades. So 7s and Js are all available"

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on turn. Situation: BB has 8s Ac. Board: Kc Td 5h 9d. So we have Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Let's see: board Kc Td 5h 9d. Straight possibilities: A-? Actually we have Ace, board includes Ten, Nine, King, Five. Ace gives wheel? Not. We have potential straight draw: 8-9-10-J-Q? No J missing. So we have gutshot: need a Jack to make straight 9-T-J-Q-K? Actually board has K, T, 5, 9. So possible straight with Ace? No. We have a gutshot draw: need a 7 to make 5-6-7-8-9? Not, we have 8, board has 5,9,10,K. 8-9-10-J-Q? Need J. So not.\n\nWe have Ace high, maybe a backdoor flush? Suits: board: Kc (clubs), Td (diamonds), 5h (hearts), 9d (diamonds). Our hand: 8s Ac (spades, clubs). So we have Ace of clubs, giving us a flush draw? There's only one club on board (Kc). Need two more clubs to make flush, but only one more club in hand, so we have 2 clubs total (Kc and Ac). Need 3 more clubs on turn and river, impossible. So no flush draw.\n\nThus our hand is just Ace high, no pair, no draw. Opponent (Seat 3 DeepSeek-V3.2) is the only remaining opponent? Actually seats: Seat 4 MiniMax-M2 also still in hand? Let's see actions: preflop: Seat 4 post_sb 1 (small blind), Seat 5 post_bb 2, Seat 3 raise 6, Seat 4 call 5, Seat 5 call 4. So three players in pot: DeepSeek (Seat 3) raised preflop, MiniMax (Seat 4) called, GPT (Seat5) called. Flop: Seat 4 check, Seat5 check, Seat3 check. Turn: Seat4 check. So after turn check, it's our turn (Seat5). So still three players active: DeepSeek (Seat3) hasn't acted on turn yet? Actually order: On turn, after flop, order is from small blind? Typically action starts with first active player left of button. Seats: 1 and 2 folded, seat3 (DeepSeek) is UTG? Actually seat numbers: 1,2,3,4,5. Seat5 is BB, seat4 is SB, seat3 is UTG. After flop, first to act is seat3 (UTG) then seat4 then seat5. But we see flop actions: seat4 check, seat5 check, seat3 check. That order seems off; maybe they act clockwise starting from seat4 (SB) then seat5 (BB) then seat3 (UTG). So on turn, seat4 check, then it's seat5's turn (us). So DeepSeek hasn't acted on turn yet? Actually seat3 would act after seat5. So we need to decide now.\n\nWe have Ace high, board is fairly coordinated: Kc Td 5h 9d. Potential draws: Straight draws: 8-9-10-J-Q? No J. 7-8-9-10-J? Need 8 and J. We have 8, so need J. So we have open-ended? Actually we have 8 and board 9-10, so we have 8-9-10, need 7 or J for straight. So we have a gutshot (need 7) or open-ended (need J)?? Let's examine: cards: 8,9,10. That's a 8-9-10 sequence. To make a straight, need either 7-8-9-10-J? Wait need 5 cards. With 8,9,10 we need either 6-7 (to make 6-7-8-9-10) or J-Q (to make 8-9-10-J-Q). But board also has K and 5. So not. So we have open-ended? Actually we have 8,9,10, need 7 or J for straight. So open-ended (both sides) but missing two cards? No, need one card either 7 or J. So we have an open-ended straight draw (8-9-10). So we need a 7 or J on river to complete straight. That's 8 outs (four 7s, four Js) but some may be dead: we have Ace of clubs, 8 of spades. So 7s and Js are all available",

We have 8, board has 9, T, so we need 7 and 6? Actually to make straight with 8 we need 6-7-9-10? Wait compute: possible straights that include Ace? No. With Ace we could have A-K-Q-J-10 but board has K and T, missing Q,J. Not possible. With 8 we could have 5-6-7-8-9 (board has 5 and 9). Need 6 and 7. Also could have 6-7-8-9-10 (board has 9 and T). Need 6 and 7. So we have gutshot? Actually need both 6 and 7, two cards, not a draw. So no immediate draw. So currently we have Ace high, K high on board. The opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 12 on turn after checks. Pot before bet: 42. He bet 12, making pot 54 (including his bet). We have to call 12 to see river. Our stack 159, so 12 is small. Evaluate opponent's range: Preflop he raised to 6 from UTG? Actually seat 3 (DeepSeek) raised 6 preflop. Likely a strong range: broadway, maybe AK, AQ, KQ, maybe some suited connectors, maybe pairs. He called the small blind (seat 4) and we called. So preflop we have AA? Actually we have A8. So preflop we called 4 after raise 6 and small blind call. So we are in a pot with him. Flop: board Kc Td 5h. He checked, we checked, small blind checked. So he checked with a range that includes missed overcards, maybe Kx, T9 combos, etc. Turn: 9d appears, giving board Kc Td 5h 9d. He bets 12, small amount. Could be value bet with K9, T9, 99, 9T, maybe a pair, maybe a straight draw? Actually board now has a pair of 9? No 9 appears only now, so no pair yet. He could have K9 (top pair), T9 (two pair?), Actually board: K T 5 9. With T9 he has two pair (T and 9). With K9 he has top pair (K). With 9x combos. Also could have a straight draw like 7-8? Not yet. Could be a bluff. Small bet suggests maybe a weak hand or a probe.\n\nOur hand: Ace high, no pair. So we are likely behind any pair. But we could have a hidden Ace that could become best if opponent has Kx? Actually if opponent has Kx, we lose to pair of K. If opponent has T, we lose. So likely losing.\n\nPot odds: need to call 12 to win pot of 54+12? Actually after his bet, pot is 42 +12 (his bet) =54, plus we call 12 to see river, final pot 66. So we need 12/66 = 18% equity. That's low. But we have no chance to improve to best hand except hitting an Ace (makes pair of A) or hitting a straight? Ace on river would give us pair of A, which would beat K, T, 9? Actually Ace would be top pair, beating K? Actually board K T 5 9, Ace pairs our Ace, making A pair, which beats K, T, 9. So Ace is a winning river card. Also a 8 would give us a pair of 8, still not best vs K or T. So only Ace wins (maybe also a 6 or 7? Would make a straight? Let's see: If river is 7, board K T 5 9 7: we have A8, still no straight. If river is 6, board K T 5 9 6, we have A8, still no straight. So only Ace makes pair, maybe also a 8? 8 would give pair of 8, still lose. So only Ace improves to best, maybe also a 9? Actually if river is 9, board becomes pair of 9s, we have Ace high still lose to any 9? Opponent could have 9, but we would still lose. So only Ace is winning, maybe also a K? Actually K would give opponent two pair, still"

          "reasoning_content": "We have a turn scenario. Our hand: 8s Ac. Board: Kc Td 5h 9d. So we have Ace high, plus a gutshot straight draw? Board: K T 5 9. We have A8. Straight possibilities: 6-7-8-9-10? We have 8, board has 9, T, so we need 7 and 6? Actually to make straight with 8 we need 6-7-9-10? Wait compute: possible straights that include Ace? No. With Ace we could have A-K-Q-J-10 but board has K and T, missing Q,J. Not possible. With 8 we could have 5-6-7-8-9 (board has 5 and 9). Need 6 and 7. Also could have 6-7-8-9-10 (board has 9 and T). Need 6 and 7. So we have gutshot? Actually need both 6 and 7, two cards, not a draw. So no immediate draw. So currently we have Ace high, K high on board. The opponent (DeepSeek-V3.2) bet 12 on turn after checks. Pot before bet: 42. He bet 12, making pot 54 (including his bet). We have to call 12 to see river. Our stack 159, so 12 is small. Evaluate opponent's range: Preflop he raised to 6 from UTG? Actually seat 3 (DeepSeek) raised 6 preflop. Likely a strong range: broadway, maybe AK, AQ, KQ, maybe some suited connectors, maybe pairs. He called the small blind (seat 4) and we called. So preflop we have AA? Actually we have A8. So preflop we called 4 after raise 6 and small blind call. So we are in a pot with him. Flop: board Kc Td 5h. He checked, we checked, small blind checked. So he checked with a range that includes missed overcards, maybe Kx, T9 combos, etc. Turn: 9d appears, giving board Kc Td 5h 9d. He bets 12, small amount. Could be value bet with K9, T9, 99, 9T, maybe a pair, maybe a straight draw? Actually board now has a pair of 9? No 9 appears only now, so no pair yet. He could have K9 (top pair), T9 (two pair?), Actually board: K T 5 9. With T9 he has two pair (T and 9). With K9 he has top pair (K). With 9x combos. Also could have a straight draw like 7-8? Not yet. Could be a bluff. Small bet suggests maybe a weak hand or a probe.\n\nOur hand: Ace high, no pair. So we are likely behind any pair. But we could have a hidden Ace that could become best if opponent has Kx? Actually if opponent has Kx, we lose to pair of K. If opponent has T, we lose. So likely losing.\n\nPot odds: need to call 12 to win pot of 54+12? Actually after his bet, pot is 42 +12 (his bet) =54, plus we call 12 to see river, final pot 66. So we need 12/66 = 18% equity. That's low. But we have no chance to improve to best hand except hitting an Ace (makes pair of A) or hitting a straight? Ace on river would give us pair of A, which would beat K, T, 9? Actually Ace would be top pair, beating K? Actually board K T 5 9, Ace pairs our Ace, making A pair, which beats K, T, 9. So Ace is a winning river card. Also a 8 would give us a pair of 8, still not best vs K or T. So only Ace wins (maybe also a 6 or 7? Would make a straight? Let's see: If river is 7, board K T 5 9 7: we have A8, still no straight. If river is 6, board K T 5 9 6, we have A8, still no straight. So only Ace makes pair, maybe also a 8? 8 would give pair of 8, still lose. So only Ace improves to best, maybe also a 9? Actually if river is 9, board becomes pair of 9s, we have Ace high still lose to any 9? Opponent could have 9, but we would still lose. So only Ace is winning, maybe also a K? Actually K would give opponent two pair, still",

Actually we are BB, so we have posted 2, the SB posted 1, so the amount to call is 1 to match the SB's bet? Wait: In BB position, after SB posts 1, BB posts 2, then action is to act. The amount to call is 1 (the SB's bet). So we can call 1 to see flop, raise minimum to 4 (i.e., total 4 chips put in). Hand is Kc4c, suited King four. That's a weak hand, suited King low kicker. In BB with 79 BB stack, should we call? Typically K4 suited is a speculative hand, can limp or raise. But with deep stacks, raising is often advisable to avoid multi-way. However we are short stack? Actually 79 BB is deep. So we could raise to 4 (minimum raise) to try to isolate, but K4 suited is not great. Could also call and see flop cheap.\n\nConsider opponent: Seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking with 212 chips. He posted big blind. He is the only opponent left (others folded). So it's heads-up preflop: SB is seat 1? Wait seat 1 posted SB 1. Seat 5 is BB. So after SB posts 1, BB posted 2. So we are in BB with Kc4c. The only other player is SB (Seat 1). He hasn't acted yet? Actually after posting blinds, the action starts with UTG, but all others folded, so SB acts first preflop. The actions list shows only blinds posted, no other actions. So it's now SB's turn to act. Actually the order: after blinds, first player to act is UTG (seat 2) but folded, seat 3 folded, seat 4 folded, then SB (seat 1) acts, then BB (seat 5). The actions list doesn't show SB's action yet; we are at BB's decision point after SB's action? The list shows only posting blinds. So it's SB's turn? Wait \"Amount to call: 1\" suggests SB has bet 1 (i.e., just posted SB). In BB's perspective, amount to call is the SB's bet of 1. So SB hasn't acted beyond posting blind. So BB can call 1 (i.e., just check the blind? Actually to call the SB's bet, you need to put 1 more chip (since you already have 2 in pot). So you can either call 1 and see flop, raise to 4 (minimum raise) which would be total 4 chips from BB (i.e., you add 2 more chips beyond your blind? Actually you have 2 in pot, to raise to 4 you need total 4, so you need to put additional 2 chips). So raise amount is 2 extra.\n\nGiven K4 suited, I'd likely just call (i.e., just check) and see flop cheap, because raising may get 3-bet and we are out of position anyway. But we are BB, which is out of position postflop (SB will be first to act). So maybe we want to limp (call) and see flop cheap.\n\nBut also consider tournament: we have decent stack, but not huge. K4 suited has some flush and straight potential, but not strong.\n\nThus best action: call (i.e., just match 1 chip). So we respond with action \"call\", raise_to null.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We are on flop. Board: Kh 9d Qc. Our hand: 4c Kc. So we have top pair (K) with a flush draw? Actually we have clubs: 4c Kc gives us Kc on board, plus we have flush draw? Board clubs: Qc only, plus we have Kc, 4c, that's two clubs. Need 3 more clubs for flush, not yet. Straight draw? Board: K Q 9, we have 4, not helpful. So we have top pair, decent kicker (4). Opponent is Kimi-K2, seat 1 is BB (they posted big blind). Actually seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking, they are BB, they checked preflop. So we are in BB, we called the small blind preflop, they checked. So flop action: they are first to act (since they are in BB). The legal actions: we have amount to call 0, min raise to 2. So we can check or raise. Need to decide.\n\nWe should consider opponent's tendencies: we have recall of a previous flop bet from Kimi-K2 in hand 6: they bet 8 on flop. That suggests they can bet on flop. But we need more context: what board was that? unknown. But they are capable of betting.\n\nNow board is K Q 9, giving straight possibilities: A J would be straight, also 10 J would be straight? Actually board K Q 9, a straight would be J 10? Let's see: 9-10-J-Q-K is a straight. So if opponent has J10, they have straight. Also they could have A K? Actually AK would be two pair? Not straight. So there are many combos.\n\nOur hand is Kc 4c: top pair, but vulnerable to overpairs (AA, QQ, JJ) and straight draws. Also we have backdoor flush draw (two clubs). Pot is 4 chips. Stack sizes: opponent 212 chips, we 157. So it's early stage. We could consider raising to protect and get value from worse hands (like AQ, Kx, QJ? Actually QJ would be second pair? QJ has Q pair, but we have K pair, we are ahead of QJ? Actually board K Q 9, QJ has Q pair, we have K pair, we are ahead. But also we could be behind to straight draws.\n\nWe can also check, see what they do. If they bet, we can call or raise. If they check, we can bet.\n\nGiven we have top pair, decent kicker, we could lead out to protect. Minimum raise is 2 (to total 2). That seems small relative to pot (4). A raise to maybe 6? But we can only raise to any amount up to our stack. Should we raise? If we raise to 6 (total), that's 2 more than call? Actually amount to call is 0, min raise to 2. So raise to 2 means we put 2 chips total. That's small. Could be effective to protect. Opponent may call with draws.\n\nGiven opponent's previous flop bet of 8 (maybe big) suggests they may bet big when they have strong hand. But we don't know.\n\nWe might want to check to see if they bet. If they bet, we can call or raise. If they check, we could bet.\n\nGiven pot is small, we could check and evaluate later. But we have top pair; checking may give them free card to improve.\n\nI think raising now is good: raise to maybe 6 chips (total). That is 1.5 BB. That puts pressure.\n\nOur stack 157, opponent 212, both deep enough. Raising to 6 gives pot odds for opponent to call with draws.\n\nThus decision: raise to 6.\n\nNow produce JSON.\n\n",

We have 5,7. So we have a pair of fives, plus a 7 kicker. Not two pair. We have a pair, but board also has a 6 and a 2, plus a possible straight draw? Board: 2-5-6, we have 7, so we have a gutshot straight draw (needs 4 for straight 2-3-4-5-6? Actually we have 5,6,7, we need 4 or 8 for open-ended? Let's see: Our cards 5 and 7, board 2,6,5. So we have pair of fives. Also we have a gutshot straight draw to 4 (2-3-4-5-6) missing 3 and 4? Actually we have 5,6 on board, we have 7, we could have straight 3-4-5-6-7, need 3 and 4. Not close. So basically just a pair.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) checked. We are in BB, small stack 159 chips, 79.5 BB. Pot is 4 chips. So we have huge stack relative to pot. This is flop. Opponent checked. We could check or raise. What is opponent's tendencies? Past data shows they check flop often (3 times). No raises. Likely a passive player. Our hand is medium strength. Could we bet to take pot? With pair of fives, board is fairly dry (no flush draw, only two spades on board). There's potential for opponent having overpairs (6s? Actually board 6, they could have 6x). Also could have 2x, 5x, etc. Our pair is low. Might be okay to check and see turn.\n\nGiven we have a decent stack and pot small, risk minimal. Raising could build pot if we think we have best hand, but risk if opponent has higher pair (6s) or 2s, etc. Since opponent is passive, maybe we can take a small bet to protect against draws (though none). A raise to 2 (minimum) would be 2 chips extra, pot becomes 6. That could be fine.\n\nBut we also have to consider tournament: we have deep stack, can afford to see next card. Checking is safe.\n\nThus choose check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. No call needed.\n\nDecision: check.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Preflop they posted SB 1 and called 1 (so they are small blind). So they are SB. They bet small amounts throughout: turn bet 2, river bet 2. That suggests they may be checking or betting small with weak hand, maybe trying to steal? Could be a continuation bet with missed draws, or a weak made hand like Ace-high (they have A? board has Ace already). Actually board Ace is on board, so they cannot have Ace. They could have Q? Board has Q, so they could have Q? Actually board Qs, so they could have Qx for pair of queens. They could have Ace? Already on board. So they could have flush draw spades, but they'd bet small.\n\nOur hand: pair of fives, low pair. Opponent could have higher pair (Queens, Aces? Ace not possible). Could have Q?

Actually board includes Ace, so they could have Ace with something else, making pair of Aces (top pair). They could also have 2 pair like A-Q? But board only has one Ace and one Queen each, they could have Ace and Queen for two pair (A+Q). That's strong.\n\nGiven they bet small 2 into pot 8 (25% of pot), maybe they are weak or drawing.\n\nOur hand has showdown value: we have pair of 5s, which is likely the worst hand on this board. Many hands beat us: any Ace, any Queen, any 6 (makes pair of 6s), any 2 (pair of 2s), any spade flush (if they have two spades), any straight? Not possible.

          "content": "We have turn with board: 9h 9d Kd 5d. Our hand Qd 8d. So we have a flush draw (diamonds) with Qd8d, currently 4 diamonds on board (9h,9d,Kd,5d) actually 3 diamonds: 9d, Kd,5d. So we have 4 diamonds total (Qd,8d plus 3). Need one more diamond for flush. Also have gutshot? Straight draws? Board: 9,9,K,5. Our Q8 doesn't give straight. So only flush draw. Also we have backdoor possibilities maybe.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 checked turn. So they have checked after flop check. Preflop they called small blind? Actually preflop: seat4 post_sb 2 (small blind), seat5 post_bb 4 (big blind). Then seat4 call 2 (so they just called SB? Wait seat4 is SB, posted 2, then called 2? Actually they posted SB 2, then call 2 to match big blind? So they are playing a limp? So they are passive preflop. Flop check both. Turn check. So opponent seems passive, maybe weak hand or drawing. They have checked multiple streets, indicating maybe not strong.\n\nOur stack 152, pot 8. Turn action: amount to call 0. Minimum raise 4. So we can check or raise. With a flush draw, we could try to semi-bluff. But opponent is passive; raising could win pot now (8) or build pot for when we hit flush.\n\nConsider effective stack: both have similar stacks? Opponent's stack unknown but likely similar (they have 215 chips). So raising to 4 (total) is small, 4 is min raise (i.e., raise to 4? Actually raise_to total amount). The pot is 8, we would raise to 4 total? That seems weird because raising to 4 is less than pot, but min raise is 4 (maybe raise to 8?). Usually min raise is current bet + 2*big blind? But they say min raise to 4, meaning raise total to 4 chips? Since amount to call is 0, raising to 4 means we put 4 chips in. So pot becomes 12.\n\nWe could also raise larger to apply pressure. But we have only 152 chips, not huge.\n\nGiven we have a flush draw with 9 outs (13 diamonds total, we have 2, board 3, so 8? Actually there are 13 diamonds, we hold Qd and 8d, board has 9d, Kd,5d = 3, so remaining diamonds = 13 - (2+3) = 8 outs). Turn to river, we have one card left, chance = 8/46 \u2248 17.4%. Pot odds: If we raise to 4, opponent may call. If they call, they'd invest 4 to win pot maybe 12+4? Actually pot after our raise would be 8 + 4 =12, opponent would call 4 making pot 16, we have 4 in, they have 4. So pot odds for us to call a bet would be different. But we are raising.\n\nWe could also check, see river. River will be one card; we could get flush 17% chance. Pot 8, if we check and opponent checks, we go to showdown with Qd8d vs unknown. Likely lose unless they have pair of 9s, K, etc. Our hand is weak, only a draw.\n\nBetter to try to steal the pot with a semi-bluff. Since opponent is passive, they may fold to raise. So raise to 4 (or maybe larger). But we need to consider tournament: we have 38 BB, comfortable. Raising small may get called; if called, we are not getting good odds (8% chance to improve, need pot odds > 5:1). If they call, pot 16, we have 4 in, need odds 4:1? Actually we need to be ahead after we hit. If we hit flush, we likely win. Expected value: probability 0.174 * (pot after call = 16) - (1-0.174)*(4) = 0.174*16 - 0.826*4 = 2.784 - 3.304 = -0.52. Slight negative. So raising to 4 may be slightly negative if called.\n\nIf we raise larger, say all-in 152? Opponent likely folds, we win 8 chips. Not worth risking many chips. But we could raise to maybe 20 chips to pressure. If opponent calls, pot becomes 8+20=28, they call 20, pot 48. EV"

          "reasoning_content": "We have turn with board: 9h 9d Kd 5d. Our hand Qd 8d. So we have a flush draw (diamonds) with Qd8d, currently 4 diamonds on board (9h,9d,Kd,5d) actually 3 diamonds: 9d, Kd,5d. So we have 4 diamonds total (Qd,8d plus 3). Need one more diamond for flush. Also have gutshot? Straight draws? Board: 9,9,K,5. Our Q8 doesn't give straight. So only flush draw. Also we have backdoor possibilities maybe.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 checked turn. So they have checked after flop check. Preflop they called small blind? Actually preflop: seat4 post_sb 2 (small blind), seat5 post_bb 4 (big blind). Then seat4 call 2 (so they just called SB? Wait seat4 is SB, posted 2, then called 2? Actually they posted SB 2, then call 2 to match big blind? So they are playing a limp? So they are passive preflop. Flop check both. Turn check. So opponent seems passive, maybe weak hand or drawing. They have checked multiple streets, indicating maybe not strong.\n\nOur stack 152, pot 8. Turn action: amount to call 0. Minimum raise 4. So we can check or raise. With a flush draw, we could try to semi-bluff. But opponent is passive; raising could win pot now (8) or build pot for when we hit flush.\n\nConsider effective stack: both have similar stacks? Opponent's stack unknown but likely similar (they have 215 chips). So raising to 4 (total) is small, 4 is min raise (i.e., raise to 4? Actually raise_to total amount). The pot is 8, we would raise to 4 total? That seems weird because raising to 4 is less than pot, but min raise is 4 (maybe raise to 8?). Usually min raise is current bet + 2*big blind? But they say min raise to 4, meaning raise total to 4 chips? Since amount to call is 0, raising to 4 means we put 4 chips in. So pot becomes 12.\n\nWe could also raise larger to apply pressure. But we have only 152 chips, not huge.\n\nGiven we have a flush draw with 9 outs (13 diamonds total, we have 2, board 3, so 8? Actually there are 13 diamonds, we hold Qd and 8d, board has 9d, Kd,5d = 3, so remaining diamonds = 13 - (2+3) = 8 outs). Turn to river, we have one card left, chance = 8/46 \u2248 17.4%. Pot odds: If we raise to 4, opponent may call. If they call, they'd invest 4 to win pot maybe 12+4? Actually pot after our raise would be 8 + 4 =12, opponent would call 4 making pot 16, we have 4 in, they have 4. So pot odds for us to call a bet would be different. But we are raising.\n\nWe could also check, see river. River will be one card; we could get flush 17% chance. Pot 8, if we check and opponent checks, we go to showdown with Qd8d vs unknown. Likely lose unless they have pair of 9s, K, etc. Our hand is weak, only a draw.\n\nBetter to try to steal the pot with a semi-bluff. Since opponent is passive, they may fold to raise. So raise to 4 (or maybe larger). But we need to consider tournament: we have 38 BB, comfortable. Raising small may get called; if called, we are not getting good odds (8% chance to improve, need pot odds > 5:1). If they call, pot 16, we have 4 in, need odds 4:1? Actually we need to be ahead after we hit. If we hit flush, we likely win. Expected value: probability 0.174 * (pot after call = 16) - (1-0.174)*(4) = 0.174*16 - 0.826*4 = 2.784 - 3.304 = -0.52. Slight negative. So raising to 4 may be slightly negative if called.\n\nIf we raise larger, say all-in 152? Opponent likely folds, we win 8 chips. Not worth risking many chips. But we could raise to maybe 20 chips to pressure. If opponent calls, pot becomes 8+20=28, they call 20, pot 48. EV",

Action: SB posts 2, BB posts 4, seat4 (MiniMax-M2) calls 4 (so they just called). Amount to call is 2 (SB's to call the BB's 4? Actually SB posted 2, BB posted 4, seat4 called 4, so SB now needs to call 2 more to match 4). Minimum raise to 8 (i.e., raise to total 8). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide. Hand JsKd suited? No, Js of spades, Kd diamond, unsuited. In SB, we are out of position, short stack? 39.5 BB, not short. J\u2660 K\u2666 is a decent hand, decent equity vs random, but against a call from BB (who could be tight?), we need to consider. The BB is Kimi-K2? Actually seat 1 is Kimi-K2 Thinking (maybe the BB). The BB's name is \"Kimi-K2 Thinking\". We have no recall data about that opponent's raise patterns. Could recall opponent actions for Kimi-K2 (BB) but not needed.\n\nWe can consider raising to isolate. Minimum raise to 8 total (so raise by 4 more). That would be a 4x raise (from 4 to 8). In SB, raising is typical with strong hands, but J\u2660K\u2666 is borderline. Many players raise with KJ, but it's okay. Considering we are out of position, raising isolates and can take the pot preflop. But also risk of being 3-bet and out of position. However, the BB is unknown. The other player (MiniMax-M2) just called, which indicates they have a wide range. So raising could be good to isolate and potentially take down the pot preflop or go heads-up with BB.\n\nStack depth: 39.5 BB, raising to 8 is ~2 BB, small raise. Could also just call and see flop out of position. But we have J\u2660K\u2666, good for post-flop play, but out of position SB vs BB and MP. Might want to raise to thin the field.\n\nPot odds: If we call, we invest 2 chips, pot becomes 12. If we raise to 8, we invest 8 total (i.e., additional 6 chips). The pot would be 10+2 (call) +6 raise? Actually after raise, the pot would be 10 (original) + 2 (SB call) + 4 (BB) + 4 (MP call) + (raise to 8 total from SB, meaning SB adds 6 more) = 24? Let's compute: initial pot 10 (SB 2 + BB 4). MP calls 4, so pot 14. SB call 2 to match 4, pot 16. If SB raises to 8, they add 4 more (since they already called 2? Actually they need to put total 8, so they add 6 more). So pot becomes 22 (16+6). So raise adds 6 chips. That seems okay.\n\nGiven J\u2660K\u2666 is a decent hand, raising to 8 to isolate is reasonable. Also we have decent stack, can play postflop.\n\nThus action: raise to 8.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So we have gutshot (need K) and also have backdoor flush draw? Suits: board Qs Th 2d, we have Js (spade) and Kd (diamond). So we have a flush draw with spades: board has Qs, we have Js, need another spade. So we have nut flush draw? Actually highest spade on board is Qs, we have Js, so we need Ace or King spade for nut flush, but we have Kd not spade. So we have a nut flush draw? No, we have J spade, board Q spade, so we have two spades, need Ace or King spade for nut flush, but we don't have them, but we could still make a flush (non-nut). So we have a gutshot straight draw and a flush draw (two outs for flush? Actually we have two spades, need any spade (9 spades left? 13 total spades, 2 on board, 1 in hand = 3 spades known, so 10 spades left). So decent draw.\n\nPot is 24 chips. Stack 152. Opponents: Seat1 Kimi-K2 (212 chips) is BB, Seat4 MiniMax-M2 (207 chips) called preflop and is in the hand. So we have two opponents: BB and MP (seat4). Both have called the preflop raise. No flop betting yet, amount to call 0, min raise 4, legal actions fold, check, raise.\n\nWe need to decide whether to bet (raise) or check. Consider opponent tendencies: we have no data from recall. Could attempt to recall previous actions of Kimi-K2 and MiniMax-M2 on flop. The recall returned none. So we have no history. Could assume typical.\n\nOur hand is a strong draw with potential to make top pair? Actually we have no pair currently. Board Q T 2, we have J, K, so we have gutshot to straight, flush draw, also have overcards (K and J). Could be a decent semi-bluff. Pot is 24, we have 152 left, so can bet around pot size to apply pressure. Raising to maybe 20-30 chips. Minimum raise is 4, but we could raise to 20 (which is total). That would be ~0.8 pot.\n\nConsider tournament stage: we have 38 BB, medium stack. Should preserve chips but also build. A semi-bluff could win pot now or set up future.\n\nCheck could allow free cards, but we risk giving free check-raise? Not likely.\n\nThus I think raise to maybe 20 chips (total). Reason: we have strong draws, want to put pressure, also protect against opponent making pair. Also we have decent stack to risk.\n\nThus action: raise to 20.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

Actually with J we have J gives us straight: Ten-J-Q-K-A? Wait we have K and J, board: Q T 2 5. So we have K-J, board Q T, that gives us a straight draw: need A or 9 for straight? Let's see: possible straights: 9-T-J-Q-K (need 9) or T-J-Q-K-A (need A). So two outs for straight (9 and A). Also we have backdoor flush? Board has two spades (Qs,5s) and we have Js (spade). So we have three spades, need one more spade on river for flush. So we have open-ended? Actually we have 3 spades, need one more for flush (9 outs approx). So total outs: 2 straight outs + 9 flush outs (but some overlap: the 9 of spades is both straight and flush? 9 spade counts both, also A spade counts both? A spade also straight? A spade would give A-high straight (T-J-Q-K-A) plus flush. So overlapping reduces total outs a bit. Rough estimate ~13 outs.\n\nPot is 84, we are facing amount to call 0 (we are first to act on turn). Actually actions: after flop betting, everyone called. Turn now: we have option to check or raise. Opponent(s): Seat1 Kimi-K2 (SB? Actually seat1 is BB?), seat4 MiniMax-M2. Both have called flop bet. We are SB, seat5. So we have two opponents.\n\nWe have 132 chips stack, pot 84, effective stack maybe 132 (our stack) vs opponents maybe similar.\n\nWe have decent draw with decent pot odds. Turn bet size? We can bet to build pot or to protect. With 13 outs, need about 13/47\u224827% chance to hit on river. Pot odds if we bet and get called? If we bet X and they call, we get pot+X+call. But we could also check and hope to see river cheap.\n\nGiven we have a draw, it's often good to bet to charge draws and get value if they have made hand. Opponents: Kimi-K2 previously bet 20 on flop, seems aggressive. MiniMax-M2 called. Could have made pair Q, T, or straight draws.\n\nOur hand currently is a gutshot? Actually we have two pair? No, we have J K, board Q T 2 5. No pair. So we are drawing.\n\nWe could bet around half pot (maybe 40-50) to get value and protect. But we must consider stack sizes: we have 132, pot 84, betting 40 leaves us 92 left. Opponents could call.\n\nCheck is also possible to see river cheap, but gives free card.\n\nGiven tournament, we have decent stack (33 BB). We can afford to be aggressive.\n\nThus I think raise (bet) to maybe 50 chips (total bet amount). Minimum raise is 20 (since previous bet? Actually no previous bet on turn, amount to call 0, min raise to 20). So we can raise to 50.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 bet on flop 20 (small). Might be medium strength. MiniMax-M2 called, maybe also medium.\n\nThus a bet of 50 could extract value from hands like Qx, Tx, maybe pair.\n\nI'll decide to raise to 50.\n\nNow produce JSON.",

Actually board: Q T 2 5 K. Our hand: J K. So we have pair of Kings, plus we have a straight? Let's see: Q-J-10? We have J, board has Q and T, that's a gutshot to straight (J would give J-Q-T-9-8? No). Straight possibilities: 9-8-7-6? No. So only pair.\n\nBoard: Qs Th 2d 5s Kh. Possible hands opponent could have: they could have a set? No board pairs. Could have two pair: QK? They could have QK (but we have Kd, they could have Qx). Could have straight: A-9? Not. Could have flush? Board has two spades: Qs, Ts, 5s. So three spades? Actually Qs, Ts, 5s are spades, that's three spades. Opponent could have two spades for flush, but we have Js (spade) and Kd. So we have one spade, opponent could have two spades for flush. Potential flush draws: they could have As? Actually need two spades: any two spades. So they could have A\u26609\u2660 etc.\n\nOur opponent: MiniMax-M2 (seat 4). Their actions: preflop they called 4 (small blind?), they called our raise preflop. Then flop they called 20 (we bet 20). Turn we bet 50, they called. River: amount to call 0, we can check or raise. So they have shown willingness to call bets on flop and turn. We bet 20 on flop, they called. Turn we bet 50 (which is 50 into pot? pot after turn: preflop pot? Let's compute: preflop: we raised to 8, others called 4 each. So pot after preflop: 2 (SB) +4 (BB) +4 (call) +8 (our raise) +4 (call) = 22? Wait details: SB 2, BB 4, we raise to 8 (so we add 8? Actually raise from 4 to 8, we put 8 total). Then seat1 call 4, seat4 call 4. So total contributions: SB 2, BB 4 (but we raised to 8, meaning we added 4 more?), Actually raise to 8 means we put total 8 chips. So contributions: SB 2, BB 8, seat1 4, seat4 4 = 18. But pot shown is 184 at river, so many bets later.\n\nFlop bet 20 each, pot becomes 18+20+20+20 = 78? Actually we bet 20, they each called 20, so add 60, pot 78.\n\nTurn bet 50 each, we bet 50, they called 50, add 100, pot 178. River amount to call 0, pot 184 (so maybe some rounding). So we have pot 184.\n\nNow we need to decide to check or raise. Opponent's stack: they have 137 chips total, after calling 50 on turn they have 137-? They started with 137, posted small blind? Actually seat4 is not blind, seat5 is BB. Seat4 called 4 preflop (so they put 4). Flop called 20, turn called 50. So total they've invested: 4+20+50 = 74. Their remaining stack = 137 - 74 = 63 chips. So they have 63 chips left.\n\nWe have 82 chips, we posted 2 sb? Actually we are BB, posted 4, raised to 8 (so extra 4). So our total invested: 8 preflop, 20 flop, 50 turn = 78. Our remaining stack = 82-78 = 4 chips left (including any remaining? Actually we have 4 chips left, which is less than the opponent's stack. So we are short-stacked relative to opponent but not all-in yet. However we cannot raise more than our remaining stack? We can go all-in for 4 chips. Minimum raise is 50 (the amount we bet on turn?), but we only have 4 chips left, so we cannot raise the minimum, so we can only check or go all-in? The rules: If you can't afford the minimum raise, you can go all-in. So we could go all-in for 4 chips (which is less than min raise). That's allowed.\n\nThus options: check"

So raising all-in is not good; we would lose 4 chips more. Better to check and hope they check, but they have 63 left and could also bet. However we cannot raise more than 4, but we could check and let them bet. If they bet, we could fold or call?

Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide preflop action. Evaluate hand strength: A9 suited is decent but not premium. In BTN position, can open raise. However there are two players left: SB (2 chips) and BB (4 chips). Both are short stacks (SB 180 chips, BB 242). Actually SB has 180, BB 242. So both have decent stacks relative to blinds (45 BB and 60 BB). They could shove or call.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, Kimi-K2 (seat 2) is the BB. Past raises amounts: many raises of 6 (i.e., 2x BB?), 12, 32, 16. So they sometimes raise bigger. They may be aggressive. Seat 1 is SB (Kimi-K2 Thinking) with 180 chips. No recall for SB.\n\nGiven we have A9s, typical strategy: open raise to about 2.5-3 BB (i.e., 10-12). Minimum raise is 8 (i.e., 2 BB). Could raise to 10 or 12. Since we have decent stack, we can raise to 12 (3 BB) to build pot and isolate. Opponents may 3-bet or call. Since they have short stacks relative to effective stacks? Actually we have 260, they have 180/242, similar. So we can raise.\n\nConsider tournament stage: unknown, but stack sizes moderate.\n\nThus likely raise to 12. Reason: standard open raise from BTN with A9s, building pot, leveraging position, also can fold if they 3-bet.\n\nThus answer: raise to 12.\n\nCheck legal: minimum raise to 8, we can raise to 12.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So now we are in BB with no raise, amount to call 0. So we can check or raise. Hand 5h6d is a suited connector, decent for deep stack but not premium. In early position (BB) but only 65 BB deep, still can play speculative hands. However there is a single opponent in SB with 120 chips (approx 30 BB). Their stack is shorter, but they just called. So they might be playing a wide range. We could consider raising to isolate. With 5-6 suited, we could raise to maybe 12-14 (3x BB). Minimum raise is 8 (to total 8). So raise to 12? The legal raise to any amount? Usually can raise to any amount >= min raise (8) up to stack. Raising could isolate and get heads up pot with good implied odds. However 5-6 suited is not a premium hand; raising might get a 3-bet from them or they may fold. Since they already called, they likely have a range of maybe 70% of hands? In tournament, we may want to steal BB? Actually we are BB, we can check and see flop cheap. With 5-6 suited we have potential for straights and flushes. With 65 BB we can afford to see flop cheap. Checking is safe.\n\nGiven opponent's stack is 120 (shorter) and they just called, they might be looking to see cheap flop. If we raise, we risk being 3-bet and losing more chips. I think best is to check (i.e., not raise). So action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have flop: T d, 2 s, T c. So board paired tens, we have 5h6d, so we have a gutshot straight draw (needs 7 for 5-6-7-8-9? Actually we have 5-6, board T T 2. Straight possibilities: 5-6-7-8-9 (needs 7,8,9) not immediate. Also we have open-ended? No. We have a gutshot to a straight with a 7 (makes 5-6-7-8-9 but board has no 8 or 9). Actually we need 7,8,9 to complete. So not strong. Also we have a pair? No. So we have just a weak hand, maybe a backdoor flush? Suits: we have hearts and diamonds, board has hearts? No hearts on board. So no flush draw.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) checked flop. They are short stack 120 chips, we have 262. Pot is 8 chips. No bet. So we can check or raise.\n\nWhat is opponent's tendency? Looking at recall: In hand 32, opponent bet 20 on flop after calling preflop. That suggests they may bet when they have something. In hand 24, they called flop bet 20 after preflop call. In hand 29, they called flop bet 25 after preflop call. In hand 27, they checked flop then called later? Actually they called a bet of 16 on flop after checking earlier. So they sometimes check and then call if bet.\n\nWe have weak hand; raising would be a bluff. Our stack 262, opponent 120, pot 8. Minimum raise to 4 (total). So raising to 4 would be a raise of 4? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in, including call. Since amount to call is 0, raise_to 4 means we bet 4 chips. That's a small bet, about 0.5 BB. Could be a probe.\n\nGiven opponent short stack, they might be willing to call a small bet with any pair or decent hand. Our hand is weak; we might want to check and see turn. Also we have decent stack, can fold if they bet later.\n\nThus best action: check.\n\nReasoning: weak hand, no draw, opponent checked, we don't want to risk chips.\n\nSo output JSON.",

Both have low stacks relative to us (2 and 4 chips). Actually blinds are 2/4, so seat1 posted 2, seat2 posted 4. Our stack 260 chips. So we are huge stack vs them. We have Q5 offsuit. In BTN, can we steal? The SB has 2 chips, which is only 0.5 BB, basically a dead short stack. The BB has 4 chips, 1 BB. Both are extremely short; they likely will be forced to fold any raise that exceeds their stack. If we raise, we can potentially pick up the blinds. However, we must consider that they could shove all-in (since they have short stacks). Minimum raise is 8 (i.e., to 8 total). That would be 4 more than the BB. The SB would have to call 8 (but they only have 2, they'd be all-in for 2). Actually they could go all-in for 2. The BB could also go all-in for 4. So raising to 8 would be a steal, likely they fold (or call all-in for 2/4). But we need to consider tournament: we have a huge stack; we can risk a raise with a weak hand to pick up blinds.\n\nGiven we have 5d Qh, not great but decent for steal. The SB is a short stack; they might be forced to shove if they have any decent hand. But they have only 2 chips, can't raise beyond that. So we can raise to 8, they can call all-in for 2, we would win extra 2 chips if they call. That's fine.\n\nThus best action: raise to 8 (minimum raise) to attempt to steal. Reason: we have huge stack, position, blinds are short, Q5 is not premium but we can take advantage.\n\nLegal actions include raise.\n\nThus output JSON.",

With K5 offsuit, not a strong hand from UTG. Usually fold. But consider opponent tendencies: seat2 (Kimi-K2) has been raising preflop often (raise amounts 12,32,12,16,12). Those are likely re-raises? Actually they are preflop raises from SB (seat2). In this hand seat2 posted SB 2 (small blind). So they may raise from SB. Their raises are fairly large (12-32) relative to 4 BB blinds? Wait blinds 2/4, so 12 is 3 BB. 32 is 8 BB. So they are aggressive. So likely they will raise when they have decent hands. Our K5 is weak.

Our Ace gives us top pair, but opponent (MiniMax-M2) has checked on flop. Pot is 16 chips (preflop pot: blinds 2+4=6, then we raised to 8 (total 8?), let's compute: Preflop actions: SB 2 (seat4), BB 4 (seat5). Then seat4 call 2 (so puts 2 more, total 4). Seat5 raise 8 (so total 8). Seat4 call 4 (so adds 4 more). So total contributions: SB: 2+2=4? Wait SB posted 2, then called 2 more = total 4. BB posted 4, then raised to 8 (so additional 4) = total 8. So pot after preflop = 4+8+4? Actually SB's 4, BB's 8, plus maybe other? Let's compute: SB 4, BB 8, total 12. But the pot shown is 16 chips. Possibly includes the raise amount? Actually after raise to 8, the total pot = SB 4 + BB 8 = 12. But they show pot 16. Maybe there is also an ante? Not likely. Might be a miscalc but okay. Anyway pot 16.\n\nNow flop: Kd 7h Ac. Our hand: As gives us top pair Aces, but also we have a flush draw? No hearts: board has 7h, we have 6h, so we have a flush draw with hearts (two hearts on board? Actually only 7h on board, we have 6h, that's two hearts, need three more hearts for flush, not a draw). So just top pair, weak kicker.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) checked. We can check or bet. Need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, MiniMax-M2 often checks on flop when they have weak hand? Let's examine pattern: In hand 32 flop they bet 20 (big). In hand 33 flop they checked. In hand 34 flop they called (so they called a bet). In hand 32 they bet big on flop. In hand 33 they checked. In hand 34 they called a bet. So mixed.\n\nWe have top pair, but opponent could have Kx, or a straight draw (maybe 9-8? Not on board). Board: Kd 7h Ac. Straight possibilities: 9-8-? No. So opponent could have Kx (maybe KQ, KJ, KT), or Ace with better kicker (like AK, AQ, AJ) but we have Ace, so opponent could have AK (but board Ace, they have Ace, they'd have two Aces? Actually board Ace, they have Ace, they'd have a set? Wait board Ace, they could have Ace also, they'd have two Aces (pair). If they have Ace, they'd also have top pair but maybe better kicker (like AK). That would be ahead of us because they'd have Ace + King kicker, but board Ace, King present, they'd have Ace-K? Actually they'd have Ace and King, board has Ace and King, they'd have two pair? Let's compute: If opponent has AK, board has Ace and King, they'd have two pair: Aces and Kings with kicker? Actually they'd have Aces (pair) and Kings (pair) using both board cards and hole cards. They would have two pair (Aces and Kings). We have Ace pair only (top pair) plus a 6 kicker, so they'd be ahead.\n\nIf opponent has Kx (like K9), they'd have top pair Kings, which is second best.\n\nIf opponent has a set of 7s (7h? Actually board has 7h, they could have 7x for set). That would be strong.\n\nIf opponent has a straight draw (like 9-8?), not possible.\n\nThus our hand is vulnerable.\n\nGiven opponent checked, we could consider betting to protect our hand against draws and get value from weaker hands like Kx, maybe also from Ace with weak kicker? But we have Ace, they could have Ace with lower kicker (like A5) which would be same pair but we have better kicker? Actually board Ace, we have Ace, they have Ace, they'd have two Aces, we have Ace, they have Ace, both have pair Aces; kicker matters: our kicker 6, theirs could be something else. If they have A5, they'd have kicker 5 vs our 6, we are ahead. So we have slight edge.\n\nBut we have a relatively weak hand, and opponent"

Opponent (seat4 MiniMax-M2) has checked flop and turn. Stack sizes: opponent 130 chips, we have 258 chips. Pot 16 chips. Turn just checked by opponent, amount to call 0. Minimum raise to 4. Legal actions: fold, check, raise.\n\nWe need to decide: check or raise. Consider opponent tendencies: from recall we see that MiniMax-M2 checks flop often (5 examples). No raise on turn data. Likely a passive player, maybe checks with weak hands. Could be a trap? They have called preflop raise and checked flop/turn. Preflop they called our raise (they called 4 after we raised to 8 preflop). So they have a hand they think decent but not strong enough to bet. Could be a middle pair, a draw, or a weak Ace like A7, A3, A2, maybe a Kx, etc.\n\nOur hand: top pair Aces, but board also has Kd. There's a possible straight draw? Board: K-7-A-3. No straight possibilities except maybe 5-4 for a straight? Not relevant. Opponent could have K7 for two pair, or K3, or K5, etc. Or they could have 7-3 for two pair. Or they could have a flush draw? No flush possible (only hearts: 7h, we have 6h, opponent could have heart flush draw? Only two hearts on board, need 3 hearts, not possible). So not flush.\n\nOur top pair is decent but vulnerable to two pair or trips (if they have Kx). Also they could have a set? No set possible (no pair on board). Could have a straight? Not likely.\n\nWe have 258 chips, opponent 130. Raising to 4 (minimum) is a small raise, about 4 chips, pot 16. That's a 25% pot raise, not big. Could be a probe to see if they fold weaker hands, but they already checked. Could also be a value raise to extract more from weaker Aces (like A2, A4). But they might have A7 (two pair) they'd call? They might call small raise.\n\nConsider tournament stage: unknown, but we have decent stack. Opponent is shortish (130). If they have Kx they'd likely call a small raise. If they have weak Ace they'd call as well. If they have nothing, they'd fold.\n\nRaising to 4 is minimal; we could also check and see river. If we check, we give free card. The turn is 3s, board now Kd 7h Ac 3s. River could be any. If we check, opponent could bet river, and we may be forced to call with top pair. Could be okay.\n\nBut we might want to protect against turn giving them free card to improve. But board is not threatening. I think a small raise is good to get value from weaker Aces and maybe fold out draws. However opponent is short stack; they might go all-in if they have strong hand (Kx) but they'd likely call anyway.\n\nRaising to 8 (double pot) could be more value. Minimum raise is 4, but we can raise higher up to stack. However we must ensure we have legal raise amount? The raise_to is total amount we put in. Minimum raise to is 4 (i.e., raise to 4 total). We could raise to, say, 20 (5 BB). But we must consider opponent's stack 130, we could raise to maybe 30 to get more value. But if we raise too much, they might shove all-in and we might be forced to call with only top pair. Might be okay.\n\nGiven we have top pair but not strong kicker, I'd like to keep pot manageable. Raise to maybe 12 (3 BB). Actually 12 > minimum 4, but it's okay. Let's consider pot odds: If we raise to 12, opponent must call 12 to see river. If they have Kx two pair they'd call, but they'd be ahead? Actually Kx gives them two pair (K+7?) Wait board Kd 7h Ac 3s. If opponent has K7, they'd have K7 (two pair K+7). That's ahead of our Aces with 6 kicker. So we would be losing. So raising could lose value to two pair. So we don't want to raise against two pair. But we can't know if they have two pair. If they have K7 they'd likely have called preflop and now check, maybe they'd check turn with two pair hoping to see cheap river. So"

          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #39, preflop, we are BB with Th7h (suited hearts). Stack 272, blinds 2/4, we posted small blind? Actually seat 5 post_sb 2, seat 1 post_bb 4. So we are SB? Wait position says BB (Seat 5). But actions: seat5 post_sb 2, seat1 post_bb 4. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. But they said Position: BB (Seat5). Possibly they treat seat5 as BB because they are in BB seat? However posted SB 2 suggests they are small blind. Might be a mistake. Regardless, amount to call is 2 (to call BB 4? Actually we posted SB 2, BB posted 4, so to call we need to match BB 4, but they say amount to call: 2, meaning we need to call the BB 4? Wait we posted SB 2, BB 4, amount to call = 2 (difference). So we are in SB, need to call 2 to complete the BB. Minimum raise to 8 (so total bet 8). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe have Th7h suited, a decent hand for SB vs one opponent (BB). The opponent Kimi-K2 Thinking has raised preflop in several past hands with amounts 5-12 (relative to blinds 2/4). That suggests they are aggressive, maybe raising 3bb to 4bb? In blind levels 2/4, a raise to 6 is 1.5bb? Actually small blind 2, big blind 4, raise to 6 means 2bb raise (from 4 to 6). Raise to 12 is 8 over big blind (2bb). So they are raising 2-3bb typical. So they are raising preflop from BB position (maybe they are in BB). So they are aggressive.\n\nOur hand Th7h suited is not premium but has decent equity vs a raise (maybe 25-30% vs typical range). In SB with 68 BB, we can consider 3-bet for value or to isolate. But 68 BB is deep; a 3-bet to 8 (total) is only 2bb raise (from 4 to 8) which is small. Actually min raise to 8 total, which is 4 over current 4 (BB). So a 3-bet of 8 is 2bb extra, which is small. That might not be enough to isolate; could just call.\n\nGiven opponent's raise size is maybe 6 (so they raised to 6?). Actually amount to call is 2, meaning BB is 4, they raised to 6? Wait they posted BB 4, but the raise action not shown. The actions list only includes posts and folds. So the raise hasn't been recorded? Actually maybe they are the only other player; they posted BB 4 and then we have to act. So there is no raise; it's just blinds. So amount to call 2 (to call BB). So it's just a blind situation, not a raise. So we just need to decide to call the BB 4 (i.e., complete the bet) or raise. So we are in SB with Th7h, opponent in BB.\n\nGiven that, we can decide to raise to isolate. With 68 BB, we can raise to e.g., 12 (3bb) or 16 (4bb). Minimum raise to 8 is allowed. A raise to 8 (total) is 4 total (i.e., 2bb). That seems small but can be used as a steal. Since we are in SB, we want to steal the BB's blind. Our hand is decent suited, could be good to raise.\n\nBut we must consider opponent's tendencies: they have raised preflop in past (aggressive). As BB, they may defend or re-raise. But we have 68 BB, can handle a 3-bet. Th7h suited is not strong enough for a big 3-bet maybe.\n\nThus a standard play: raise to about 12 (3x BB) to put pressure. But we must follow min raise to 8; we can raise to 12 (total). That is legal.\n\nGiven we have no raise yet, we can raise to 12. Reason: attempt to steal, hand has some equity if called, also isolate.\n\nThus choose action \"raise\", raise_to 12.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action on flop: we have Kc 9s, board Qs 5d 8c. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) in seat 4 bet 11 into pot 33. Our stack 264, we have 66 BB. We are BTN, we called preflop. So flop: we have Kc 9s, board: Qs 5d 8c. Hand combos: we have gutshot straight draw? Let's see: cards: 9,8,? Actually we have 9 and board 8, so we have open-ended straight draw? Need 7 or J for straight: 7-8-9-10-J? Wait we have 9, board 8, Q,5. So possible straight draws: 7-8-9-10-J requires 7 and J; 9-10-J-Q-K needs 10 and J; we have K, so need J and 10 for straight K-Q-J-10-9? Actually K-Q-J-10-9 is a straight, we have K, need J and 10. Also we have gutshot to a straight with 7? 7-8-9-10-J? Not with K. So we have two overcards (K) and a gutshot? Actually we have a gutshot to a straight: need J for 9-10-J-Q-K? No need 10 and J. So not a gutshot; we need both 10 and J. So currently we have only one pair? No pair. So we have overcards: K is top pair potential, 9 is middle.\n\nBoard: Qs 5d 8c. Opponent bet 11 (about 1/3 pot). Pot 33, bet 11, we call 11 to see turn, pot would be 55 after call.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: from recall, seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) has shown some patterns: In hand 32, they bet 20 on flop after raising preflop? Actually hand 32: preflop call 8, flop bet 20 (bigger). Hand 33: flop check, turn bet 4. Hand 34: flop call 8, turn bet 8. Hand 38: flop check, turn check, river check. So they sometimes bet small on flop, sometimes check. They seem to be a relatively passive player, maybe medium strength.\n\nIn this hand, they raised preflop to 8 (small raise) from UTG? Actually seat 4 is probably UTG? Not sure. They raised 8 (2x big blind) which is a limp raise? Could be wide range.\n\nNow flop bet 11 (about 1/3 pot). This could be continuation bet with a wide range, maybe they have Q, 8, 5, or combos. Could also be a bluff with missed overcards.\n\nOur hand Kc 9s has some equity: we have two overcards, a gutshot? Not exactly. We have a backdoor flush draw? We have spade Kc? Actually Kc is clubs, not spade. Board has Qs, so we have no spade. So no flush draw.\n\nOur equity vs opponent's range: If opponent has Qx (like QJ, QT, Q9 etc.) they'd have top pair, we have K kicker maybe second best. If they have 8x they'd have middle pair, we have K kicker. If they have 5x they'd have bottom pair. If they have combos like J10 (draw) we have some equity.\n\nGiven small bet, we could call to see turn, as we have decent equity and stack deep.\n\nWe need to consider tournament: we have 66 BB, comfortable.\n\nThus call seems appropriate.\n\nCheck if raising is possible: minimum raise to 22 (i.e., raise additional 11). Raising would be to 22 total. That would be a 2x raise. Could be a semi-bluff? Not much.\n\nBetter to call.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

Board: Q-5-8-6. Our 9 gives us a gutshot straight draw: 7 would complete 5-6-7-8-9? Wait we have 9, board has 8,6,5, Q. Straight possibilities: 9-8-7-6-5 would need 7. So we have gutshot to 9-high straight (needs 7). Also we have backdoor flush? We have Kc 9s, board has clubs? Qs is spade, 5d diamond, 8c club, 6s spade. We have one club (9s is spade). So not flush draw. We have top pair? No Q on board, we have K, not pair. So we have only gutshot.\n\nOpponent MiniMax-M2 (seat 4) checked the turn after betting flop 11 (we called). So they checked. That could indicate weak or pot control.\n\nPot currently 44 chips. Opponent checked, we have option to check or raise. Minimum raise to 11, meaning raise to 11? Actually raise_to is total amount we put in. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 11 would be a bet of 11 (since min raise = 11). So raise to 11 (i.e., bet 11). Could also raise more.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: opponent stack unknown? Not given but earlier they had 111 chips preflop. They have not bet much, so likely still near 111. Our stack 253. So we have big stack relative.\n\nOpponent tendencies from recall: Past actions show they sometimes bet small on turn (4,8). They also check sometimes. Not clear. They seem to be a passive player who checks often, but also bets small when they have something.\n\nOur hand is weak. Likely we should check and fold to river bet. Since we have only a gutshot and no pair, it's not worth betting. Also we have position (BTN) but opponent is in SB? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, they were SB? Preflop: seat1 post_sb 2, seat2 post_bb 4, seat3 fold, seat4 raise 8 (so seat4 is UTG? Actually seat numbers: seat1 is SB, seat2 BB, seat3 maybe UTG, seat4 is maybe cutoff? Wait table: seat1 SB, seat2 BB, seat3 maybe UTG, seat4 maybe MP? But not important. They are the only other player left, they are acting first (they checked). So we are last to act.\n\nGiven the board, they may have Qx, 8x, 6x, 5x. They could have a queen, a pair, a straight draw, etc. Checking could be a trap or weak.\n\nBetting 11 into 44 is about 1/4 pot. Could be a probe bet. Raising could be seen as aggression, but we have weak hand. Might be okay to check and see river.\n\nThus choose check.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. Folding not applicable because no bet. So choose check.\n\nProvide reasoning.",

We have 9, board 8,6,5, Q, A. Not a straight. Could have gutshot? No. No flush (two spades: 9s, 6s, plus board has spades? Qs and 6s are spades, we have 9s, that's three spades, need five). So we have K high, maybe Ace high? Board has Ace, we have K, so we have K kicker. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) checked river after checking turn. Preflop they raised to 8, we called. Flop they bet 11, we called. Turn check both. River check both. Pot 44. So opponent's range? Preflop raise from UTG? Actually seat 4 is MiniMax-M2, we are BTN, they raised 8 from early? Not sure position: seat 4 is likely UTG? Table seats: seat1 SB, seat2 BB, seat3 maybe UTG? Actually seat numbers: seat1 SB, seat2 BB, seat3 maybe UTG? seat4 maybe MP? Anyway they raised preflop and called flop bet. Their line: raise preflop, bet flop, check turn, check river. That suggests maybe they have a hand like middle pair, overpair, top pair, maybe a draw that missed. Board: Q A 8 6 5. They could have Qx, Ax, 8x, 6x, 5x. They bet flop 11 into pot? Preflop pot: 8+8+2+4 = 22? Actually preflop: they raised 8, we called 8, plus sb 2 and bb 4 = total 22. Flop pot 22, they bet 11, we called, pot now 44. Turn check both, pot stays 44. River check both, pot 44. So checking suggests they have a hand not strong enough to bet. Could be a weak pair, a draw, or a hand like K9? Our K9 is not strong. Opponent could have QJ, Q9, Q8, Q7, Q6, Q5, Q4, Q3, Q2, maybe A? But they have Ace on board, they could have A? But they'd likely bet. Could be a missed straight draw like 7-9? Actually 7-9 would have straight 5-6-7-8-9, but board is 5-8-6-A-Q, 7-9 would make straight? Let's see: board 5,6,8, Q, A. With 7 and 9 you have 5-6-7-8-9 = straight, but board missing 7. So you need 7 and 9. Opponent could have 7-9, they'd have a straight on river? But they didn't bet, so unlikely.\n\nOur hand Kc9s: we have K high, no pair. So we are likely behind any pair or better. Could we bluff? River check from opponent suggests they are weak. Could we bet to steal? But legal actions: fold, check, raise. Minimum raise to 11. Pot 44, so raise to 11 would be small, raise to 55? Actually raise to 11 total? Minimum raise is 11, meaning you must raise to at least 11 chips total (i.e., raise by 11?). Usually raise_to is total amount. Since amount to call is 0, raising to 11 would be a bet of 11. That's a small bet (1/4 pot). Could be a bluff.\n\nBut we have Kc9s, not a good showdown value. We could check and hope they check and we win with K high? But opponent likely has something better, maybe Qx or A? Actually board has Ace, so any Ace would be top pair, but they'd likely bet. They checked, maybe they have a weak Ace like A2? But they'd still have top pair Ace, they'd maybe bet. However they could be slow playing? Not likely.\n\nGiven we have no showdown value, best to check and fold if they bet. But we have option to raise as bluff. Is it profitable? Opponent's stack: they have 111 chips left. They have checked river, could be willing to call a small bet if they have K high? They have K? Actually they could have K? Board has K? No, board no K. So they could have Kx, which would be second best (K9 vs K"

Actually J can make straight with Q? Board: A K T, need Q J? Straight possibilities: A K Q J 10? Actually board A K T, we have J J. A K Q J T would be a straight, but we need Q. So we have gutshot to a straight (need Q). Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Suits: board A\u2663? Actually board: Ac Kh Ts (clubs? Ac is clubs, Kh hearts, Ts spades). Our Jd Jc: one club, one diamond. So we have a backdoor flush draw with clubs (need two clubs). Not strong.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 28 into pot 80. So bet is about 35% of pot. He is in the small blind (seat 4). He called preflop raise (we raised to 24, he called 16). So preflop he called a raise of 24 (our raise to 24, he called 16 more). So he has a decent hand to call a 3x raise from BB? Actually raise to 24 is 3x big blind. In BB, raising 24 after SB 4, BB 8: preflop raise to 24 is 3x BB. He called with presumably a hand that can defend. Could be broadway combos, suited connectors, etc.\n\nNow flop bet 28 (35% pot) is a relatively small continuation bet. Could be a wide range: many hands, including Ace, King, Ten, draws, etc. Could also be a check-raise later.\n\nOur hand: JJ is currently middle pair. Against his range, we likely are ahead of many hands (like Kx, Ax? Actually Ace high beats us, but Ace is top pair. He may have Ace, which is ahead. King also ahead. Ten gives us two pair? Actually board includes T, we have J, so we have J-J, board T, we have pair J, not two pair. If he has T, he has top pair with kicker unknown; we are behind. If he has Q, we have gutshot straight draw; Q would be a gutshot but also open-ended? Actually Q would give him open-ended straight draw (K Q J T). He could have Q? He could have QJ (but we have J's). So not.\n\nWe have overpair to board? Actually board is A K T, we have J J, so we have a pair lower than Ace and King. So it's a medium strength hand.\n\nGiven bet size is small, we could consider calling to see turn. But we need to think about stack: we have 229 chips, after raising preflop we have put 24 in, opponent called 16, pot 80 includes blinds? Let's compute: Preflop: SB 4, BB 8, we raise to 24 (so we put 24 total? Actually we posted 8, then raise to 24, so additional 16). So contributions: SB 4, BB 24, other? Actually seat 4 (MiniMax) called 24? Wait action: preflop: Seat 5 raise 24 (our raise). Seat 4 call 16 (since he already posted 8). So total in pot preflop: SB 4 + BB 24 + SB? Actually seat 3 posted SB 4 (but seat 3 is SB? Wait seat 3 posted_sb 4, seat 4 posted_bb 8. So seat 3 is SB, seat 4 is BB? Actually seat numbers: seat 3 post_sb 4, seat 4 post_bb 8. So seat 3 is SB, seat 4 is BB. Then seat 5 (us) raise 24 (so we are BTN?). Actually we are seat 5 BB? The problem says position BB seat 5. So seat 5 is BB. So seat 3 posted SB, seat 4 posted BB? Actually seat 4 is \"MiniMax-M2\". But they posted_bb 8, meaning they are the BB? But we are BB. Something inconsistent. But we accept that seat 5 is BB.\n\nAnyway pot 80 after flop bet. So pot before flop bet: 80. Then opponent bet 28, making pot 108 if called. So calling 28 would be about 25% of pot.\n\nGiven we have 229 stack, calling 28 leaves us 201. So not huge.\n\nWe need to decide fold, call, raise. Raising would be to at least 56 (minimum raise). That would be a large raise, maybe too strong.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies: Past actions"

So we have gutshot to a straight (need Q). Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Suits: board A\u2663? Actually board: Ac Kh Ts (clubs? Ac is clubs, Kh hearts, Ts spades). Our Jd Jc: one club, one diamond. So we have a backdoor flush draw with clubs (need two clubs). Not strong.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 28 into pot 80. So bet is about 35% of pot. He is in the small blind (seat 4). He called preflop raise (we raised to 24, he called 16). So preflop he called a raise of 24 (our raise to 24, he called 16 more). So he has a decent hand to call a 3x raise from BB? Actually raise to 24 is 3x big blind. In BB, raising 24 after SB 4, BB 8: preflop raise to 24 is 3x BB. He called with presumably a hand that can defend. Could be broadway combos, suited connectors, etc.\n\nNow flop bet 28 (35% pot) is a relatively small continuation bet. Could be a wide range: many hands, including Ace, King, Ten, draws, etc. Could also be a check-raise later.\n\nOur hand: JJ is currently middle pair. Against his range, we likely are ahead of many hands (like Kx, Ax? Actually Ace high beats us, but Ace is top pair. He may have Ace, which is ahead. King also ahead. Ten gives us two pair? Actually board includes T, we have J, so we have J-J, board T, we have pair J, not two pair. If he has T, he has top pair with kicker unknown; we are behind.

Actually board: A K T 9. Our Jacks give us a pair of Jacks, but also we have an open-ended straight draw? Let's see: A K Q J 10 would be a straight, but we have A K T 9, J gives us J T 9 8 7? Actually J with board gives us potential straight: 9 T J Q K (needs Q). Also A K Q J T (needs Q). So we have gutshot? Let's compute: With J, we have J T 9, need Q for straight (9-10-J-Q-K). Also we have J, T, A, K - need Q for A K Q J T straight. So we have two possible straight draws needing Q. So we have a gutshot (one card) for straight. Also we have overpair to board? Actually board has Ace and King high cards, we have Jacks, which is lower than both. So we are behind any Ace or King. Also there could be a set if opponent has 9 or T. Opponent's range: they called preflop raise from BB. They are MiniMax-M2, stack 103 chips, likely in middle position (Seat 4). Preflop they called raise 24 (so they have about 24+8=32 in pot). Flop board: A K T 9. They bet 28 into pot 108? Actually pot after flop: preflop pot: raise 24 (our raise) + call 16 from them + blinds 4+8 = 52? Wait compute: Preflop: SB 4, BB 8, we raise to 24 (so we put 24, SB 4, BB 8). Then Seat4 (MiniMax) calls 16 (to match 24). So pot after preflop: SB 4, BB 8, our raise 24, their call 16 (but they put 16 extra? Actually they called 16 more to reach 24 total, so they contributed 24 total: 4+8? Wait they posted BB 8, then called 16 more = total 24. So contributions: SB 4, BB 8, us 24, them 24 = 60. Pot 60.\n\nFlop: seat4 bets 28, we call 28. So pot becomes 60+28+28=116? Actually after bet 28 (seat4) and call 28 (us), pot = 60+56=116. The prompt says pot 108 before turn. Slight discrepancy but okay.\n\nNow turn: seat4 checks. So they have a weak hand or drawing.\n\nWe have Jacks, a pair, but board is A K T 9. Potential combos: They could have Ace, King, Ten, 9, or combos making two pair, sets, etc. They checked. Could be a draw (Q, J, 8). But they have no J? Actually they could have QJ for straight? That would be a made straight already? QJ would make K Q J T 9? That's not a straight, need K Q J T 9? Actually sequence: 9-10-J-Q-K is a straight. So QJ gives them straight already. That would be strong; they'd likely bet. So they likely don't have QJ.\n\nWhat about a set? They could have TT or 99. If they had TT, they'd have set of tens, they'd bet. So probably not.\n\nCould be Ace-high (A x) with maybe a gutshot? They might check to see if we bet.\n\nOur hand is decent but vulnerable to any Ace or King. Our stack 201 chips, pot 108. We are out of position (BB). The opponent checked, we can check behind (control pot) or bet (value or bluff). What is our equity? If we check, we let free card. Turn card unknown? Actually turn card already revealed? Turn is currently being acted on; board is Ac Kh Ts 9c, turn just happened? Wait board shows 4 cards: Ac Kh Ts 9c. So turn is 9c. So the turn card is 9c, we are on turn action. The board includes 9c. So we have Jacks, still no pair on board. The opponent checked.\n\nWe could bet for value against weaker hands like lower pairs (T9, 9x, maybe 8-7 draws). Also could bluff to represent Ace/King? But we have no Ace/King.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: Opponent 103 chips, we 201. Pot 108."

          "reasoning_content": "We have Jacks on board Ace King Ten nine. So board: A\u2663 K\u2665 T\u2660 9\u2663. We have pocket Jacks, giving us a pair of Jacks, plus we have a straight draw? Actually board: A K T 9. Our Jacks give us a pair of Jacks, but also we have an open-ended straight draw? Let's see: A K Q J 10 would be a straight, but we have A K T 9, J gives us J T 9 8 7? Actually J with board gives us potential straight: 9 T J Q K (needs Q). Also A K Q J T (needs Q). So we have gutshot? Let's compute: With J, we have J T 9, need Q for straight (9-10-J-Q-K). Also we have J, T, A, K - need Q for A K Q J T straight. So we have two possible straight draws needing Q. So we have a gutshot (one card) for straight. Also we have overpair to board? Actually board has Ace and King high cards, we have Jacks, which is lower than both. So we are behind any Ace or King. Also there could be a set if opponent has 9 or T. Opponent's range: they called preflop raise from BB. They are MiniMax-M2, stack 103 chips, likely in middle position (Seat 4). Preflop they called raise 24 (so they have about 24+8=32 in pot). Flop board: A K T 9. They bet 28 into pot 108? Actually pot after flop: preflop pot: raise 24 (our raise) + call 16 from them + blinds 4+8 = 52? Wait compute: Preflop: SB 4, BB 8, we raise to 24 (so we put 24, SB 4, BB 8). Then Seat4 (MiniMax) calls 16 (to match 24). So pot after preflop: SB 4, BB 8, our raise 24, their call 16 (but they put 16 extra? Actually they called 16 more to reach 24 total, so they contributed 24 total: 4+8? Wait they posted BB 8, then called 16 more = total 24. So contributions: SB 4, BB 8, us 24, them 24 = 60. Pot 60.\n\nFlop: seat4 bets 28, we call 28. So pot becomes 60+28+28=116? Actually after bet 28 (seat4) and call 28 (us), pot = 60+56=116. The prompt says pot 108 before turn. Slight discrepancy but okay.\n\nNow turn: seat4 checks. So they have a weak hand or drawing.\n\nWe have Jacks, a pair, but board is A K T 9. Potential combos: They could have Ace, King, Ten, 9, or combos making two pair, sets, etc. They checked. Could be a draw (Q, J, 8). But they have no J? Actually they could have QJ for straight? That would be a made straight already? QJ would make K Q J T 9? That's not a straight, need K Q J T 9? Actually sequence: 9-10-J-Q-K is a straight. So QJ gives them straight already. That would be strong; they'd likely bet. So they likely don't have QJ.\n\nWhat about a set? They could have TT or 99. If they had TT, they'd have set of tens, they'd bet. So probably not.\n\nCould be Ace-high (A x) with maybe a gutshot? They might check to see if we bet.\n\nOur hand is decent but vulnerable to any Ace or King. Our stack 201 chips, pot 108. We are out of position (BB). The opponent checked, we can check behind (control pot) or bet (value or bluff). What is our equity? If we check, we let free card. Turn card unknown? Actually turn card already revealed? Turn is currently being acted on; board is Ac Kh Ts 9c, turn just happened? Wait board shows 4 cards: Ac Kh Ts 9c. So turn is 9c. So the turn card is 9c, we are on turn action. The board includes 9c. So we have Jacks, still no pair on board. The opponent checked.\n\nWe could bet for value against weaker hands like lower pairs (T9, 9x, maybe 8-7 draws). Also could bluff to represent Ace/King? But we have no Ace/King.\n\nWe need to consider stack sizes: Opponent 103 chips, we 201. Pot 108.",

Our chance of being called is high, and we would lose. Better to check and preserve stack. Since amount to call is 0, checking is safe. So action: check.\n\nReturn JSON.",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop with Td9c in BB facing a raise to 16 (so 8 to call, min raise to 24). Opponent seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) raised. We have data: Past raises amounts: 4,4,8. Showdowns: hand 24 they had Tc9s (they had T9 suited, same rank but suited hearts? Actually they had Tc9s). That hand they made a showdown with community Qs Th 2d 5s Kh - they had pair tens? Actually they had Tc9s, board includes Th, so they had top pair tens, maybe lost? Not sure outcome. Hand 40 they had KsJc and board Qs5d8c6sAh \u2013 they missed. Hand 42 they had Kc8h board AcKhTs9c3d \u2013 they had pair kings? Actually board includes Ac Kh Ts 9c 3d, they have Kc, so they have pair of kings, maybe win.\n\nSo opponent seems to raise small amounts preflop (4-8) from SB? Actually seat 4 is presumably UTG? But they are raising from early position? Not sure.\n\nOur stack 193, blinds 4/8, we are BB with 24 BB. Our hand Td9c unsuited, decent connectors, but not premium. In BB vs raise 16 (2x BB) from seat 4, we can consider call or raise (3-bet). 3-bet to 24 min raise (i.e., 24 total). That would be 24 total, meaning we raise to 24 chips (i.e., 16 more). That is a small 3-bet, about 3x raise (since raise to 24 from 16). Actually raise amount is 24 total, which is 8 more than call? Wait: amount to call is 8, min raise to 24 means total bet of 24, which is a raise of 16 over call. So 3-bet to 24, that's 3x the original raise (original raise 16). That's a decent size.\n\nWe need to consider opponent's tendencies: they raise small, maybe wide range. Our hand is suited? No, unsuited. So maybe call and see flop? But we are out of position (post-flop we will be out of position). With 24 BB stack, we want to preserve chips. T9 unsuited is a marginal hand. I'd likely fold to a raise from early position, especially out of position with 24 BB. However 8 to call is not huge relative to stack; but we risk playing out of position.\n\nGiven opponent's raise size is small, they might be raising with wide range, but also could be stealing. Our hand has some potential for straight draws. Could call and see flop for cheap. But if they are aggressive, they may continuation bet.\n\nI think best is to call (8) to see flop, preserving stack, and we have implied odds. But we have 24 BB, call 8 = 8 chips, leaving 185. That's fine.\n\nThus action: call.\n\nProvide reasoning.\n\n",

So fairly weak.\n\nOpponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 16 into pot 48, so about 1/3 pot. Could be continuation bet with many hands, including strong Qx, overpairs, draws. Our stack 185, opponent stack 179. We have 185, after call 16 we will have 169 left. The pot after call will be 48+16+16=80. So pot odds: need to call 16 to win 80 => 16/80 = 20% required. Our chance to improve? We need to hit straight (J or K) or maybe flush backdoor (low chance). Probability of hitting straight on turn or river: we have 2 outs (J, K) = 4 cards (two each? Actually each rank 4 suits, we have none of them, so 8 outs? Wait J and K each 4 suits = 8 outs). But some may be dead? Unknown. So approx 8 outs. Turn: 8/46 \u2248 17.4%; if miss turn, river: (38/45)*8/45? Actually compute chance to hit by river: 1 - (38/46)*(37/45) = about 1 - (0.8261*0.8222)=1 -0.679=0.321 => 32% chance to hit straight by river. Plus backdoor flush: we have one club, need two more clubs. There are 13 clubs total, we have 1, board has 1, so remaining clubs = 11. Turn: 11/46 \u2248 23.9%, then need another club on river: 10/45 \u224822.2% => combined probability about 5%? Actually probability of both clubs: (11/46)*(10/45)=110/2070=5.31%. So total improvement chance approx 32%+5% \u224837% to make strong hand (straight or flush). Also could pair 9 or T on turn/river: 3 outs each? Actually there are 3 remaining 9s and 3 remaining Ts = 6 outs. Probability to pair by river: 1 - (44/46)*(43/45) \u2248 1 - (0.9565*0.9556)=1 -0.913=0.087 => 8.7% chance to pair. So total chance to improve to at least pair: about 46% maybe.\n\nBut current hand is weak, likely behind many of opponent's range. Should we fold? Considering pot odds 20% and chance to improve maybe 46% but many of those improvements may still be behind opponent's strong Qx or pair. Straight will beat many, flush maybe. But still maybe marginal.\n\nOpponent's betting pattern: preflop raise to 16 (3x BB). Likely a standard raise range includes broadway, pairs, suited connectors. On flop Q-2-8, they continuation bet 16 (1/3 pot). Could be many hands, including Qx, 8x, 2x, overpairs, draws. Our T9 is a decent draw with open-ended straight draw? Actually it's a gutshot? Wait we need J and K for straight, that's 2 ranks, 8 outs. That's decent. So we have a decent draw. Could consider calling.\n\nRaising? Minimum raise is 32, raising to 32 would be a pot raise? That would be 16 more. Not advisable with weak hand.\n\nThus best action: call.\n\nLet's provide reasoning.",

Hand: T9 unsuited, board Q 2 8, we have gutshot to straight (J gives 9TJQK? Actually need J for straight 8-9-10-J-Q? Wait board: Q 2 8, we have T9, so we have open-ended? Let's see possible straights: 8-9-10-J-Q is a straight, we have 9 and T, need J. Also 9-10-J-Q-K also straight, need J or K? Actually with Q, we could have 10-J-Q-K-A? No. So only gutshot needing J. Also we have backdoor flush possibilities? Suits: we have Td (diamonds) and 9c, board hearts, clubs, diamonds. One diamond on board (8d), we have Td, so we have a flush draw? Need two more diamonds, only one on board, so not immediate. So hand is weak but has gutshot and some overcards. Opponent (MiniMax-M2) bet 16 into pot 48, pot after bet 48+16=64? Actually pot before bet 48, opponent bets 16, so pot now 64. Our call 16 gives us pot odds: 16/(64+16)=16/80=0.2 => 20% required. Gutshot approx 4 outs (J) plus maybe two overcards for pair? Actually we have overcards T and 9, board Q 2 8, we could pair T or 9 on turn/river. That's 2 outs each? Actually each has 3 remaining, total 6 outs for pairing. Plus gutshot 4 outs (J). Some overlap? J not same rank as T or 9. So total outs ~10. Approx 10/47 ~21% chance to improve by river, but need turn+river? Actually we need one card to improve now? Straight on turn or river, also pair on turn, etc. So probability of hitting something by river maybe 30-35%? Pot odds 20% okay. Also stack depth 185, opponent likely medium stack. Could consider raise? Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise additional 16). Raising would be 32 total, we would be putting 32 more chips. Would we be good? Likely not; we have marginal hand. Better to call and see turn. So call.\n\nReturn JSON.\n\n",

However a raise could be seen as a bluff; but we have no fold equity maybe low. Let's consider: If we raise to minimum 16, we put total 16 more, making pot 80. If opponent calls, we lose 16 more with no showdown value. If opponent folds, we win 64. What is probability they fold? Unknown. Opponent's prior aggression: they raised preflop, bet flop, then checked turn and river. That suggests they may have a medium hand like Qx or 8x that they were comfortable betting flop but then checked when board didn't improve. Could be they have Q8, Q2, Q3, Q6, etc. Might also have a pair of 8s, but board has 8d, they might have 8c? Not on board. Could be they have a straight draw? Not likely. They might have a hand like QJ for top pair, but they'd probably bet on turn. So they likely have a weak hand or missed draw; they might fold to raise.

Raising to 16 isolates the short\u2011stack SB, potentially wins the pot pre\u2011flop, and builds a manageable pot for a hand that can flop well. The raise is within stack size and gives us a chance to take the initiative.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have BB with 6h7h, small blind posted 4, big blind posted 8. So we are BB, we already posted 8. The small blind (Seat1) posted 4. So amount to call is 4 (to match small blind). Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total bet 16). Stack 165. Need decide.\n\n6h7h suited is a decent speculative hand, especially in BB vs SB with 4 chips (small). In tournament with 20 BB stack, we can consider limping or raising. Usually with suited connectors, we can raise to isolate or limp. But SB is likely a short stack? Actually SB has 158 chips, similar stack. Could be a raise from SB? But SB only posted 4, no raise yet. So we can either call (i.e., just check to see flop) or raise. Raising to 16 would be 8 more (since we already have 8 in pot). That's a 2x raise over big blind, standard. 6h7h is a good hand to see a cheap flop; we can also call and see flop cheap. But we are out of position post-flop (SB is left of us). Actually after SB and BB, action goes to SB first preflop, then BB (us) if we call. So if we just call, we will be out of position on flop (SB acts first). Raising can potentially isolate and gain position (since SB would act after us preflop? Actually after raise, SB would act first post-flop still, because they are still left of BB. But they will have to act first preflop; if they fold, we get heads-up with later positions. So raising could isolate.\n\nConsider opponent tendencies: Kimi-K2 Thinking (SB) has raised preflop amounts of 5,6,12 etc. So they are willing to raise. But in this hand they just posted blind, not yet acted. Could raise later.\n\nGiven we have 6h7h, a raise is okay to try to steal or get action. But we are out of position anyway; raising may commit chips. However 6h7h has good implied odds, and stack 165. A raise to 16 is not huge. Could also just call and see flop cheap.\n\nPot odds: If we call 4, pot will be 12+4+4=20? Actually pot currently 12 (blinds). If we call, pot becomes 12+4+4 = 20? Wait small blind 4, big blind 8 = 12. If we call 4, we add 4, making total pot 12+4=16? Actually the small blind is already in pot, big blind also. The pot is 12 (4+8).

Actually raise to 16 total). Then Seat1 (Kimi-K2 Thinking) re-raised to 48. So amount to call is 48-16 = 32. Minimum raise to 80 (so raise total would be 80). We have stack 153, can raise.\n\nWe need to consider hand strength: 6h7h suited, decent suited connector, but not premium. In BB vs a raise from UTG? Position: seat1 is UTG? Actually seat1 is under the gun? Not sure but seat1 is the other player left of BB (they posted BB). So they are in SB? Wait: seat5 is BB, seat1 posted SB 4 earlier (post_sb 4). Actually seat5 is BB, seat1 posted SB 4? The actions: preflop: Seat5 post_sb 4 (so seat5 posted small blind? Wait seat5 is our seat, but they posted SB 4, meaning we are in SB? But description says Position: BB (Seat5). But actions show seat5 posted sb 4, seat1 posted bb 8. So seat5 is SB, seat1 is BB. However the problem statement says \"Your Position: BB (Seat 5)\". Might be swapped. Let's trust the description: we are BB, we posted 8? But action shows seat5 post_sb 4. Something inconsistent. However we see we raised to 16 (so we opened raise from BB? Actually if we are BB, after posting 8, we can raise. So raising to 16 is a raise of 8 more? That matches typical raise to 16 from BB. Then seat1 (who posted SB 4?) raised to 48. So they are the opponent.\n\nThus we are facing a 3-bet (re-raise) from opponent with 6h7h. Stack 153, effective stack after their 48 bet is 153-16? Actually we have 153 total, we have already put 8 (big blind) then raised to 16 (so additional 8). So we have 153-16 = 137 left. To call 32 more, leaving us 105. Minimum raise to 80 total (so raise additional 64). That would be a 5-bet? Actually raise to 80 total, which is 80 - 48 = 32 raise amount (plus call?). Wait raise to 80 means total contribution after raise is 80, meaning we would put 80 total, which is 80-16=64 more chips. That seems large.\n\nGiven hand is marginal, likely fold. Opponent may be strong. Our stack 19 BB, need to preserve. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON.\n\n",

Could be raise amount? Hard to interpret). In any case, they have been raising sometimes big. But we are on button with kings. We can consider raising to isolate and build pot. Minimum raise to 16 (i.e., total 16). Our stack is 153, so we could raise bigger, maybe to 48 or more. However, we need to consider opponent's tendencies: they have raised 48 previously, which is a big raise (maybe they are aggressive). But we have a strong hand; we should raise to protect against being called by many players. Only SB and BB remain (two opponents). Both have decent stacks: 178 and 218. They may call or re-raise. We could raise to maybe 48 (like they did before) to isolate and get value. But we also have short stack relative to blinds? 19 BB is not extremely short; can still raise.\n\nWe need to ensure we are not overcommitting if they re-raise all-in. If they re-raise all-in, we have to decide. But with KK we are ahead of most hands. So raising is good.\n\nThus action: raise to maybe 48 (total). Or maybe to 40? Minimum raise is 16.

          "reasoning_content": "We have flop: Ks Kh vs board T\u2660 2\u2660 2\u2665. We have top set of Kings. Opponent (BB) checked. Pot 100, we have 105 stack, we are short stacked (13 BB). We have a very strong hand, but we need to consider opponent's range and potential draws. Board is paired low, possible full house draws (e.g., 2x, T's). Opponent could have T2 combos, 2x, maybe a straight draw? No straight possible (board T 2 2). So only possible threats are full house (2s) or maybe a set of Tens (but they would have to have T2? Actually set of Tens requires TT, but board has T\u2660 only one ten, need another ten in hand, possible TT). Also could have a full house with T2 (e.g., T2 gives full house Tens over Twos? Actually board: T 2 2, hand T2 gives two pair (T and 2) not full house. Full house would be TT2 or 222T etc. So opponent could have a set of Twos (2x) giving full house Twos over Tens (2 2 2 T T?). Wait board has two twos, need third two for set, plus a ten for full house? Actually full house is three of a kind plus a pair. If opponent has 2x (third two) and also a ten, they'd have full house twos over tens (222 TT). That's possible only with hand 2T. Also could have TT (pair of tens) making set of tens (TT) with board T gives three tens, plus board has two twos, so they'd have full house tens over twos (TTT 22). So opponent could have TT, 2T, or maybe 2x with no ten (just set of twos) which would be just three of a kind twos, which loses to our set of kings. So we have best possible hand except opponent could have full house (TT or 2T). Those are combos: TT (3 combos) but one ten is on board, remaining tens: hearts, clubs, diamonds (3). 2T combos: need a two (there are two twos on board, remaining two: spades and clubs? Actually board has 2\u2660 and 2\u2665, so remaining twos: 2\u2666 and 2\u2663 = 2 combos) and a ten (remaining tens: hearts, clubs, diamonds = 3). So combos = 2*3 =6 combos. So total full house combos = 9 combos. Also opponent could have a straight draw? No.\n\nThus we have a strong hand, but opponent may have a full house. Should we bet? Yes, we should bet for value. But we have short stack; we can go all-in (105). Minimum raise is 40, raising to 105 is all-in. Pot is 100, we can raise to 105 (all-in) making pot 205 (if called). That's good value. Opponent may call with full house combos (9 combos) or maybe with a lower pair? But they might call with any pair? With short stack, they might call with any decent hand. But we have to consider that we are short stacked and need chips. So we should raise all-in.\n\nLegal actions: fold, check, raise. We should raise all-in to 105. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We have UTG with Td Jc (10-J offsuit). Stack 193 chips, 24.1 BB. Blinds 4/8, so effective stacks about 24 BB. UTG raise standard? In a tournament early-ish, with 24 BB, we could raise to 24 (3x big blind) typical. However we are short stack maybe need to be aggressive. Opponent DeepSeek-V3.2 is seat 3, after us? Actually UTG seat5, then seat6? Wait seats: 1-5 are players, seat5 is us. Seat1 Kimi-K2 Thinking, seat2 Kimi-K2, seat3 DeepSeek-V3.2, seat4 MiniMax-M2, seat5 us. So order preflop: after posting SB and BB, action starts with UTG (seat5) first? Actually UTG is seat5, but UTG is after BB? In 5-player table, UTG is first to act preflop (under the gun) meaning left of big blind. So we act first. The amount to call is 8 (big blind). So we can fold, call (8), or raise minimum to 16 (i.e., raise to 16 total). We have 24 BB, could raise more. Need to decide.\n\nHand Td Jc is decent but not premium. In UTG, raising is standard to isolate. With 24 BB, raising to 24 (3x) is okay. Opponent tendencies: DeepSeek-V3.2 has raised 6, 16, 20 in past. Those are small raises (maybe 1.5-2.5x). So they may be aggressive but also raise small amounts. MiniMax-M2 unknown.\n\nGiven stack size, we could consider a 3-bet? Actually we are opening, not 3-bet. Should we just call? Not advisable UTG call. Better raise to standard 3x BB = 24. Minimum raise is 16, but we can raise higher. Legal actions allow raise (no limit). So raise to 24.\n\nReasoning: decent hand, need to build pot, isolate, and avoid being called by many players. Also we have decent stack.\n\nThus action: raise to 24.",

Wait board: Jh (Jack hearts), Js (Jack spades), Kh (King hearts). That's two Jacks on board. Our hand: Td (Ten diamonds) and Jc (Jack clubs). So we have three of a kind Jacks (trip Jacks) with a Ten kicker. Actually we have trips Jacks, plus a Ten. The board also has a King, so potential full house? Opponent could have Kx for trips Kings? Actually board has one King, so opponent could have Kx to have pair of Kings with board's King, but board also has two Jacks, so they'd have two pair (Kings and Jacks) if they have a King. They could have a set of Kings if they have K? There's only one King on board, need two more for set. So opponent could have K? Actually they could have K? They have one King on board, they could have another King for pair of Kings (pair), not set. So best they could have is two pair Kings and Jacks, or a straight? Board: J,8,J,K. Ten gives potential straight? 8-9-10-J-Q? No Q missing. So not straight. Could be a flush? Two hearts on board: Jh, Kh, plus 8d. We have Td (diamond) and Jc (club). No flush.\n\nOur hand is strong: trips Jacks. Opponent (Seat 2) called preflop raise, and called flop bet. They have 106 chips, short stack. They are in SB? Actually seat 2 is Kimi-K2 (maybe SB). Their stack is 106 chips (10.6 BB). They called raise preflop 24 (they had 106, posted SB 4? Wait they posted SB 4 earlier? preflop: Seat 3 post_sb 4, seat 4 post_bb 8. So seat 2 is not SB, seat 3 posted SB, seat 4 posted BB. Seat 2 is maybe UTG? But anyway they have 106 left after calling 24, so they have 82 chips left.\n\nNow turn action: amount to call 0, we can check or raise. Minimum raise to 50 (so raise to total 50). Pot currently 176.

Actually flop pot before bet: after preflop, pot: our raise 24 + call 24 + call 16? Wait preflop: we raised to 24, seat2 called 24, seat4 called 16 (since they were BB, they posted 8 then called 16 to match 24). So preflop pot = 24+24+16+4+8? Actually SB posted 4, BB posted 8, then raise to 24, call 24, call 16. So total contributions: SB 4, BB 8+16=24, us 24, seat2 24. So pot = 4+24+24+24 = 76? Wait compute: SB 4, BB (seat4) posted 8 then called 16 = total 24, us 24, seat2 24 => sum = 4+24+24+24 = 76. Yes pot 76 after preflop.\n\nFlop: we bet 50, seat2 called 50, seat4 folded.

Opponent could have a set of Jacks? They would need a Jack in hand, but board already has two Jacks, they could have the third Jack (Jc) but we have that. So they can't have set Jacks. They could have a set of Kings if they have a King? But need two Kings in hand, impossible. So opponent could have a straight? With board J,8,J,K, need 9-10? Not possible. Flush? Two hearts on board"

Effective stack: opponent 82 chips, we have 287. Minimum raise to 40 (i.e., raise to 40 total). Need to decide.\n\nK8 suited is a marginal hand in BB vs short stack raise. Consider opponent's raise size: 24 into 8/4 blinds (3bb). That's a standard open raise from early position? Actually seat 2 is likely UTG? Not sure. But they have 82 chips (10.25 BB). Short stack, likely to shove soon. Raising 24 (3bb) is small; maybe they are trying to steal? Could be a wide range. K8 suited is decent but not premium. Against a short stack, calling may be okay for set mining? Not good.\n\nStack sizes: if we call 16 more (to 24 total), we will be at 271 chips left, opponent at 66 chips (if they call). Pot after call: 36 + 16 = 52 chips. Opponent's effective stack 66 vs us 271. We would be out of position post-flop (they are in UTG, we are BB). K8 suited has some potential for straight/flush draws.\n\nGiven short stack, maybe we should consider re-raising (3-bet) to isolate. But K8 suited is not strong enough to 3-bet for value; could be a bluff, but short stack may call or shove. Minimum raise to 40, which is 5bb total. That's still relatively small. If we 3-bet to 40, opponent might just call and then go all-in later? Their stack 82, they could shove all-in for 58 more (to 82). That would be a huge risk for us with K8.\n\nBetter perhaps to fold. Evaluate equity: K8s vs unknown range of short stack raise (maybe 20% of hands). K8s equity maybe ~35% vs that range. But calling 16 for pot 36 (pot odds ~ 16/(36+16)=16/52=30.8%). So pot odds are okay. However post-flop disadvantage, and implied odds limited because opponent short stack.\n\nThus folding is likely best.\n\nLet's produce JSON.",

With 17.7 BB, typical push/fold range. JTs is a good hand for shove in short stack UTG. Minimum raise is 32, but that would be less than half stack; could also go all-in (283). Need to consider opponent tendencies: raise frequencies from earlier data: we saw some raises amounts: MiniMax-M2 raised 16 (likely a limp? Actually raise to 16 is just calling big blind? In preflop, after SB 8, BB 16, then UTG acts; raise to 16 is just calling? Minimum raise is 32, so raise to 16 is not a raise but call? The data may be ambiguous. But we have some opponents raising 24, 32, 48, 168 (big). So they may be willing to raise larger.\n\nGiven short stack, pushing is advisable. JTs is strong enough to push. If we call, we risk being outkicked, and may be forced to fold later. So best is to go all-in (raise_to = 283). Legal actions include raise; we can raise to all-in. Reason: short stack, good hand, maximize fold equity.\n\nThus action: raise to 283.",

So it's just us facing 16 to call. Legal actions: fold, call, raise. Minimum raise to 32 (i.e., raise 16 more). We could raise to 32 or more. Should we raise? In UTG, 7Ks is a decent raising hand. Given stack depth, raising to 32 (2x BB) is standard open. Could also consider a bigger raise to isolate. But we have 17.7 BB, still enough.\n\nWe need to consider opponent tendencies. Might recall opponent actions for UTG raises? Let's query recall_opponent_actions for seat 3 (DeepSeek) maybe they are aggressive? Let's fetch past actions.",

K7o has very low equity and will likely be dominated, and with a short stack we should preserve chips rather than call or raise.\"\n}",
          "reasoning_content": "We have hand #67. We're BB with 7h Ks. Preflop: SB (seat3) posted 8, BB posted 16. Then we (seat5) raised to 48 (i.e., 3bb total). Seat1 folded. Seat2 (Kimi-K2) raised to 118 (so re-raise). Then seats 3 and 4 folded. So we face a 3-bet to 118. Amount to call is 70 (since we already have 48 in, need to put total 118, so 70 more). Minimum raise to 188 (i.e., raise at least to 188 total). Stack 235, we have 235 total chips, but we have already posted 16 blind + 48 raise = 64 in pot? Actually we posted 48 includes blind? Usually raise to 48 means total contribution 48, which includes the 16 blind, so extra 32. So current stack after raise: 235 - 48 = 187 left. To call 70 would leave 117. To raise to 188 total (i.e., add 140 more), would require total contribution 188, we have 48 already, need 140 more, but we only have 187 left, so possible. Minimum raise is 188 total, which is less than stack (188 <= 235). So we could raise.\n\nNow evaluate hand: 7h Ks off-suit. Not a premium hand. In BB vs 3-bet from seat2 (Kimi-K2). Need to know opponent tendencies: recall shows Kimi-K2 often folds preflop, sometimes raises 24 (small). In hand 52, 58 raised 24 preflop. In this hand they raise to 118 (large). Their stack? Unknown but they have 178 chips (they are at 178). So they are short-stacked relative to blinds (8/16). 118 raise is about 7.4 BB (since BB is 16). That's a big raise, maybe a 3-bet or a 2-bet? Actually they are in seat2 (UTG? seat order: seat1,2,3,4,5). Seat2 is after seat1 (maybe UTG). They might be opening raise? Wait: SB posted 8, BB posted 16. Then seat5 (BB) raised to 48. That's a raise (3BB). Then seat2 (Kimi) raised to 118. That is a 3-bet (re-raise). So Kimi is 3-betting. Their pattern: they rarely 3-bet large; they usually raise 24 (maybe 1.5 BB). So this large 3-bet suggests strong hand. Could be AA, KK, AK, maybe QQ, maybe JJ. 7Ks is not strong enough to continue. Also our stack is shallow (14.7 BB). Calling would leave us with 117 chips left (approx 7.3 BB). That's still enough for later. But we risk being dominated.\n\nGiven we have K7 offsuit, not great vs 3-bet. We could consider folding. But maybe we could call as a speculative hand? K7 suited would be okay, but off-suit is weak. Also K7 offsuit has some equity vs AK (maybe 30%). But vs typical 3-bet range (AK, AQ, JJ+, maybe 99-66, AQs, etc), K7 offsuit is very weak.\n\nThus folding is advisable.\n\nCheck if any tournament considerations: stack 235 chips, short. Need to preserve chips. So fold.\n\nThus output JSON with action fold, raise_to null, reasoning.\n\n",

Pot 48 (includes blinds and our BB). Seat 4 (MiniMax-M2) posted SB 8, we posted BB 16, then seat 4 raised to 32 (so raise amount 32 total? Actually raise to 32? Wait: \"preflop: Seat 4 raise 32\". The raise amount is likely total bet of 32, i.e., they raised to 32, which is 16 (SB) + 16 raise? Actually SB posted 8, BB 16. A raise to 32 means they put total 32, so they added 24 more (since they already had 8). But the amount to call is 16 (our BB) to match the raise (they raised to 32, so we need to call 16 more). Minimum raise to 48 (i.e., raise to 48 total). Legal actions: fold, call, raise.\n\nWe need to decide with 6c T d? Actually 6d Tc (six of diamonds, ten of clubs). That's a relatively weak hand, off-suit, not a straight draw preflop. In BB vs SB raise, typical range of SB could be wide but maybe they are raising small (to 32) which is 2x SB, 2x BB? Actually it's 2x BB (16) raise. That's a standard raise size. In tournament with short stacks (13.7 BB), you could consider defending with suited connectors, broadways, etc. 6T offsuit is not great. Likely fold.\n\nCheck opponent tendencies: MiniMax-M2 raises amounts: previously raised 4 (small) maybe early in tournament when blinds were lower? Hand #43 raise amount 16 (maybe bigger). Their raise size varies. No indication they are aggressive or loose. But with 6T offsuit, we should fold.\n\nThus action: fold. Provide reasoning.\n\n",

          "reasoning_content": "We need to decide action preflop with Ah Qh on BTN, stack 13.2 BB (211 chips). Blinds 8/16, pot currently 172 (includes blinds and raises). Action: SB posted 8, BB 16, Seat3 (DeepSeek) raised to 48 (so 48 total? Actually raise amount 48 means they put 48 total? Usually raise to 48, meaning they added 32 over BB). Then Seat4 (MiniMax) raised to 100 (re-raise). So we face 100 to call, min raise to 152. Our hand is strong (AQ suited). Our stack 211, we can call 100 leaving 111 chips. That's about 5.5 BB left. That's short stack. We are in BTN, we can consider shoving all-in (raise to 211) or calling. But min raise is 152, which is less than stack. Could raise to 152 (minimum raise) or go all-in 211. Considering opponent tendencies: DeepSeek has raised various amounts, sometimes huge (240). MiniMax raises modestly (max 32). Both have short stacks? Not given. Their stacks: Kimi 154, 174; DeepSeek 216; MiniMax 73. MiniMax is short (73 chips). He raised to 100, which is more than his stack? Wait his stack is 73 chips, but he raised to 100? That seems impossible. Actually maybe stacks displayed before action? The table shows MiniMax-M2 - 73 chips (so his stack after posting blind maybe?). But he raised to 100, meaning he must be going all-in (since 73 < 100). So likely his raise is all-in for 73? But the raise amount shown is 100 maybe includes his blind? He posted small blind? No, seat 4 is MiniMax, position after seat3 (UTG?). Actually seat order: SB seat1, BB seat2, seat3 is UTG, seat4 is next (maybe MP). So seat4 hasn't posted blind. So raise to 100 would be his total bet of 100, which exceeds his stack 73, meaning he must be all-in for 73. But the system may allow raise beyond stack, but actual effective amount is his stack. However, we treat as all-in for 73. So pot currently: SB 8, BB 16, DeepSeek 48, MiniMax 73 (all-in). So pot ~145? But they listed pot 172, maybe includes some extra. Anyway, we face a short stack all-in. Our best move: call (i.e., call 73 effective) or go all-in ourselves. Since we have a strong hand, we can call to try to double up. But calling 100 would overcommit to 111 left, still short stack but okay. If we raise to 152, we would be raising more, but we don't have that much chips left (211). Raising to 152 would leave 59 chips, still short. Might be okay to go all-in to maximize equity.\n\nGiven tournament considerations: we have 13 BB, short stack, need to pick up chips. AQ suited is premium. We should go all-in (raise to 211) to maximize pressure, but we are already short stack; calling may be enough. However, if we raise to 152 (minimum raise) we could be re-raised? No more players left. So we could just call. But raising all-in may be seen as aggressive but okay.\n\nLegal actions: fold, call, raise. Raise_to must be total amount. Minimum raise is 152, but we could raise to 211 (all-in). That would be a raise, not a call.\n\nGiven short stack and strong hand, I think go all-in (raise to 211). Reasoning: we want to double up, opponents are short (MiniMax all-in). DeepSeek's raise size variable, but likely has strong hand. Still AQ suited dominates many ranges. So go all-in.\n\nThus JSON: action \"raise\", raise_to 211, reasoning.\n\n",
